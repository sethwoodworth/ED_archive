The palace
'''The Palace''' was an avatar-based [[chat]] platform that originated as a gathering place for those into [[BDSM]]-style sex with [[fat whore]]s. It revolutionized the art of talking to one another with genitals in hand. 

Sometime around 1998/1999 [[Comedy Central]] created a [[South Park]] Palace that drew in everyone not old enough to own a driver's license, and those old enough to own a driver's license who used it to deliver pizza.  

Inevitably, these two groups collided, and all the old people with their kinky sex talk became the object of much [[lulz]] as their palace degenerated into a community of people who stole one another's uncreative avatars by using the print screen button and MS paint; this was typical Palace [[drama]].

The entire thing went bankrupt around 2001. It exists in small pockets to this day as a hangout for identity crises of all kinds, including [[Goth]]s and the [[Wapanese]].
