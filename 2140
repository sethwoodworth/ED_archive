Death to all Juice
[[File:Death-to-all-juice.jpeg|thumb|right]]
[[Last Thursday|On December 28, 2008]], a highly uneducated [[Jersey Shore|New Jersey]] high school student and Arab-wannabe known as Mexican attended an Anti-[[Israel]] protest outside of the Israeli embassy in New York. At the site, he held up a picket sign that should have said "[[Holocaust|Death to all (Zionist) Jews]]". Just like every other Arab on the planet, he was [[retard|uneducated]] and [[Engrish|sucked so much at spelling]] that he misspelled Jews and the sign read "Death to all Juice". And thus, because of his crappy grammar, the image of Carlos Almonte holding his sign became popular on Failblog and thus, a meme was born.

[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/carlos_eduardo_almonte/index.html According to the New York times], Carlos Almonte and his [[Lover|friend]] Mohamed Mahmood Alessa were arrested [[Last Thursday|on July 5, 2010]] at the [[John F. Kennedy]] airport on their way to [[Somalia]]. They were planning to join Al Shabab (a branch of [[Al Qaeda]]) in order to kill [[Americunt]] soldiers in Somalia. Nobody knows where they are now. They are most likely in [[Cuba|Guantanomo Bay]] being [[Raped|interrogated]] and eating [[Cock|cock-meat sandwiches]] with [[cum|extra mayonnaise]] while getting [[sodomy|asshammered by]] [[Bubba|the Man]].
