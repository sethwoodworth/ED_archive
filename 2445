Dramouted

One of the many effects the birth of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] has had on the [[internets|interverse]] is its amazing ability to harness the powers of [[Google]] in order to push [[ED]] articles about the inhabitants [[LiveJournal]], [[dA]], [[Furaffinity]] and other internets communities to the top of the list of search results for that username.  It is [[bullshit|documented fact]] that when someone is senselessly attacked by another user with little to no social life, the victim will [[google]] the [[troll|troll's]] name in hopes of finding some type of dirt on them, possibly a [[Ohbutyouwillpet|Megan's Law]] reference or photos of a brief stint in an [[1980s|80s rock cover band]].

Early victims of [[dramouted|dramouting]], including well known morons [[Killhamster]], [[Ghostlight]], [[Brainlesswonder]] and [[Fireuzer]] struggled not only to hide their shock, upset, and hurt from dramoutings, but also to name and label the phenomenon.  They originally settled on ''EDed'' during a prolonged [[circle jerk]];  however, after the realization that this could be confused with [[paigegirl|getting penetrated in the ass by a large talking horse]], it was decided that a new term was needed.  Unfortunately, no new effort has been made to [[Ebonics|coin a phrase]] describing this, and most likely none will occur, since the only victims of dramouting are socially isolated losers who have a fascination with downloading nude pictures of [[Star Trek|Captain Janeway]].

The term, of course, only applies to a situation when the [[dramouted]] individual is at a lack for words or cohesive arguments, and thus simply wants to mock away the issue by playing it cool. 

==Proper usage==
* "OMG, I was dramouted!"
* "OMG, You dramouted me!"
* "WTF, dramouted [[in the ass]]?!"
* "Damn you! Dramouted again."
