'''''World of Warcraft''''', commonly known as “WoW” or "Wow, my life has gone down the shitter" is an extremely overrated shitty [[MMORPG]] created by [[Blizzard]] after they decided to jump in on the MMO bandwagon. It now has [[What|11 million subscribers]], proving there is [[truth|no God]]. It is currently the largest hub of MMO (massive male orgy) gaming comprised exclusively of fat greasy [[furries]] who are 49, usually weighing [[over 9000]] pounds apiece, who "[[fellatio|kill]]" internet [[Runescape|dragons]] for pretend [[cum|money]] and experience points, making them [[gay|strong]] enough to [[fellatio|kill]] bigger [[FYIAD|internet dragons]]. Trapped in this cycle, they play in their parents' basements, emerging only a few hours a week to tell the world about [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|their newest magical weapons and arena levels]].

The inhabitants of the WoW forums are also among the most chronically illiterate [[loser]]s on the face of the planet. In fact, WoW players are considered to be so horrible that even other MMO players [[irony|spit on them]]. And that's just the tip of the [[penis|iceberg...]]

==Game==
[[File:World of Warcraft man eating postbox.png|thumb|right|150px|Your average in-game enemy.]]

You must first begin by downloading [[over 9000|3 gigabytes of]] [[shit|client data]] and ten terabytes of patches. It will take approximately half a month to download from their shitty P2P network, during which time you may continue chronically [[fap|fapping]] to internet [[child porn|pr0n]] and entertaining pipe dreams that you [[lies|won't die alone.]]  ([[truth|NOTE]]:  You [[die alone|'''will''' die alone.]])

After managing to get past the buggy software and buggy login screen, you are given a 10-page questionnaire on [[shit nobody cares about|deciding what server you will spend the rest of your life on, how many piercings you want on your character's cock, guessing which broken/overpowered class to play on, and other mundane details of your new persona]] (which will all wind up being more interesting than the details of [[you|your old persona]]). 

After that jive, you get a quick [[Lame|introduction]] and your first quest. By the time you turn that quest in and get the second, you'll quickly realize what you'll be doing the majority of the game. [[Srs|Srsly.]] Your virtual [[you]] gains experience by questing (killing the same ten monsters over and over for experience), grinding (killing the same ten monsters over and over for experience), or just being lazy and following someone around "Leeching" ("watching" them kill the same ten monsters over and over for experience). This involves venturing through eight [[shit|surreal]] worlds with [[shit|fel-demons and demons and fel-demon-fels]]. 

Once you manage to get to level 85 in ''EverQuest for Kids'', you will probably have to join a [[circle jerk|guild]] if you haven't already. Guilds usually set aside a few hours each night to grab as many of their [[Idiots|members]] as possible and fight some sort of demon or dragon that drops an [[Macrophilia|oversized weapon]]. This will spark drama over who gets to loot the weapon. You know, just like in every other [[MMORPG|MMO]]?

[[truth|After you have succeeded in getting every epic internet sword and shiny armor, you will be granted the awesome and ultimate privilege of standing in the middle of a city where other players may click you and inspect your armor for the entire duration of your logging on.]]

If you haven't died of Edema from sitting in the same position weeks on end in front of your computer, you are offered the option of changing your race for $30, [[BME|changing your appearance]] for $40, enhancing your cock for $25, doing all this for $300, and ordering a mini version of a boss that screams the same lines over and over to follow you for $500. You may also change servers for $250 and an extra $50 monthly fee. 

==How to Win World of Warcraft==

[[Image:Worgenhomolove.jpg|thumb|Wow players trying out the new worgen race]]
[[Image:WoWnerdwat.jpg|thumb|Yet another typical ''World of Warcraft'' player. Notice the amount of fail on the "getting laid" meter.]] 

1. Don't buy or play ''World of Warcraft''.<br/>
2. That's it. You [[win]]. Congratulations.<br/>

==Races==
''World of Warcraft'' delivers a plethora of fictional races to escape [[Emo|your depressing]] existence:

===[[USA|The Alliance]]===
The Alliance mainly consists of children and teenagers who sit on their character jacking off rather than doing their math homework, so teamwork and gameplay on this faction is a [[orgy|smorgasbord]] of unorganized [[Katrina|disaster]] and [[AIDS]]. '''Everyone is a goddamn Night Elf'''.

*'''[[Humans]]''' - The only available race where players can feel safe without having to know they aren't some retarded mutant like in [[IRL]]. The men are abnormally bulky and the women have unusually large [[penis|heads]].
*'''[[Viking|Dwarves]]''' - The dwarves may be [[Jewish]]: Huge noses, long beards, retarded dances, and a racial ability to find treasure.
*'''[[Midget|Gnomes]]''' - This race is commonly played by [[13-year-old|13-year-old boys]] who spend all day PvPing instead of graduating middle school. Due to their small size, this is also a favorite race of pedophiles. In addition, they can be used as cannonballs in a pinch. Gnome players will generally use names with the word "gnome" in it because it's [[unfunny|hilarious]].
*'''[[Animu|Night Elves]]''' - The whores of the ''Warcraft'' world, closely modeled off of [[Alizée|real whores]], and the closest thing Blizzard has gotten to [[anime]] in order to increase sales due to all the stupid ''[[Naruto]]'' fanboys out there. Mostly played as female by men to get attention from other men and epic lewt under the [[its a trap|guise]] of being a hot [[Camwhore|MySpace whore]]. Also fans of Al Gore and friends of the environment. Night elves live in trees as a political statement are most likely [[Liberal]] douchebags.
*'''[[Communism|Draenei]]''' - The first expansion race gives the Alliance big blue [[Russia|Russian]] aliens with [[tentacle rape|penis-tails]] for their beard. They can be found in [[Iraq|Shattrath]] City, getting drugs from their dealers known as [[god|Naaru]].
*'''[[Wolfaboo|Worgen]]''' - Because so many wolfaboos bitched over how the Alliance didn't have a furry class of their own, Blizzard decided to be retarded and give them what they want. Now every user will be yiffing each other as soon as they buy the damn expansion.

===[[Afghanistan|The Horde]]===
The Horde consists of a mixture of neckbeards, [[fat]], and [[teenager|acne]]. They will always win in PvP matches and kill the dragons first. The amount of points in Internet damage they can do is directly proportional to their weight in pounds. '''Everyone is a goddamn Blood Elf'''.

*'''[[Black|Orcs]]''' - Orcs are big, [[black|have an unusual skin color]], and prone to anally [[rape]] small moving things with battle axes. Players who use this race are [[Michael Jackson|whiter than white]].
*'''[[Jamaica|Trolls]]''' - They talk like Rasta men and probably smoke a ton of [[pot|mojo]], mon.
*'''[[Goth|Undead]]''' - [[Goth|Goths]] use these, period. Just start smoking [[penis|Djarum Blacks]] now. Also a favorite of PvPers because they're [[Fact|impossible to kill]].
*'''[[Native Americans|Tauren]]''' - This race is the ideal race for [[furries]] and [[neckbeard|neckbeards]]. Half of the Tauren userbase will have the word "moo" or "cow" in their names because they think they are [[lulz|clever and internet-funny]], when in reality they need to cut off circulation to their dick and set themselves on fire.
*'''[[Faggot|Blood Elves]]''' - The other ridiculously faggoty elf race of the game. Joined the Horde [[BAWWWWW]]ing because the Alliance wouldn't give them [[buttsecks|respect]].  [[Lie|Surprisingly]], neither does the Horde.  The males look like a cross between rejected [[Final Fantasy VII|Sephiroth]]/''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' [[fanart]] and the females are [[Britney Spears|anorexic bitches]]. By law, '''all''' blood elves are named some variant of "[[Lord of the Rings|Legolas]]". Any other name is unacceptable.
*'''[[Arab|Goblins]]''' - A clever mix of gnomes, orcs, and Jews. Like gnomes, they're popular with the rest of the races for their potential use as projectiles and [[football]]s. Unlike gnomes however, they violently explode when used as such.

==Classes==
[[Image:niggerstrong.jpg|thumb|A mighty [[Black|dark-skinned]] warrior slaying [[dong|a fearsome basilisk]].]]

After choosing a race, the player is given the choice of what class they should choose for their character. [[Blizzard]] employees insert a marble dildo halfway into their asses and type on their keyboards with the base of the dildo to make changes and balance fixes in the game with upcoming patches.

*'''[[Viking|Warrior]]''' - All you do is melee combat things for countless hours of your life, nothing more. No one will expect you to do anything but act as a [[vagina|meat shield]]. No one trusts you enough to DPS.

*'''[[Noob|Paladin]]'''- Everybody expects this class to [[Boring|heal]], and if you do anything else, people will hate you. Because it makes perfect sense that the class in full plate should stand in the back and [[Masturbation|heal]]. Paladins may be mods, as they drop large [[Banhammer|hammers]] on other players while they hide in a bubble so that [[Noone]] can do anything to them. After they get bored they will cast a 10 second long spell that teleports them to [[Japan]]. All paladin names are variations on "Arthas".

*'''[[Steve Irwin|Hunter]]''' - Most popular class for [[Faggot|CASUALS]]. You [[Pokemon|capture]] poor, defenseless animals and [[bestiality|make them your slave]]. It's also the base of every [[Shit nobody cares about|argument]] on ''thottbot.com'' to dictate that every weapon is a [[Communist|"hunter weapon"]] considering ranged only classes need +Strength for their 3 melee attacks. Hunter names are unremarkable, however their pets' names are always hilarious; exempli gratia; spiders named WEBU or cats named QUIETDETH.

*'''[[Christian|Priest]]''' - The whiny healing bitch. Played only by faggots who like to attend 80-man raids on a finicky [[AOL]] connection. Their purpose is to beat the tank in aggro to die and fuck over the raid group. All priest names are a variation of "Nohealsforyou". Blood Elf Priests LOVE the name "Priestitute" (no matter which gender is their character).

*'''[[Woman|Mage]]''' - Only for [[Woman|making food and water]] for the [[Good Korea|Koreans]]; serves as a [[Team Fortress 2|dispenser]]. All mage names are a variation of "Frostitute".

*'''[[BDSM|Shaman]]''' - The most overpowered class in the game. Shamans can [[shit|plant]] some stupid [[dildo|totems]] that do nothing, but they can also heal themselves while dealing ridiculous amounts of damage and [[Bullshit|immediately come back to life when they are killed]]. Shamans are brought to raids for their ability to pass out amphetamines and speed up the raid quickly through boring content.

*'''[[Otherkin|Druid]]''' - The class where you can become MOAR [[Furries|FURRY]], or otherwise just serve as another [[woman|healing bitch]]. They are clearly a cheap hybrid-class knockoff of the superior paladins. The previous sentence is '''guaranteed''' to cause EXTREME FUCKING [[RAGE]] in chat. All druid names are a pun on "tree" or "moonkin".

*'''[[Satan|Warlock]]''' - Like hunters, but [[Satanic]]. If you enjoy being a huge, overpowered faggot, warlockery is for you. Requires being able to hit five buttons (four if you're Destruction spec), those wacky warlocks! Usually played by [[Columbine|trenchcoat-wearing goth sodomites]]. All lock names are puns on "DOT", and I do mean ALL lock names.

*'''[[13|Rogue]]'''- The bane of life on the "pvp" server. Also, the lulziest class in the game. This class is only played by 13 year-old boys. [[Skill|Rogues only require you to be able to hit one button]]. Modeled after the classic rapist, Rogues are commonly seen in PvP applying [[Roofies|poisons]] and [[Date_rape|incapacitating other players]] to facilitate a full-on rectal assault to gather combo points and unleash a [[I_came|finishing move]]. All names include "shank", "stab", "shadowstep" or some combination of the three.



*'''[[Osama|Death Knight]]''' - The first "[[An hero|Hero]] Class" in the game introduced with about an hour of quests in new locations YOU WILL NEVER FUCKING SEE OR MAKE REFERENCE TO EVER AGAIN.  Introduced in the second expansion (see below), they start out [[evil]] but are soon presto-changeo'd into [[pretty cool guy|good guys]] so they can [[Columbine|fit in with the rest of society]].  This is the [[Lie|exciting brand new class]] that [[You|everyone]] makes, but no one will bother inviting because there are [[Mexico|TOO FUCKING MANY]]. They are as useless as warriors, as Blizzard was creative enough to make them exactly like such. The only new thing this class comes with is a character voice that sounds like they have [[your mom|semen trapped in their lungs]]. While the Blizzard Employee was writing code for the Death Knight, he realized that [[CP|all files have completed downloading]] and decided to [[Fap|choke the chode]] rather than design a playable class. As a result, blizzard has promised changes to Death Knights in the next [[Lies|expansion]] so that everyone won't leave when they see a death knight in their dungeon group. Death Knight names are possibly the best thing about the game. Unfailingly hilarious; some examples that actually exist: Dethmurda, Kilraper, Dalichking (every DK is named some variation of this), Bluddymrda, and the ever-suave Eaturpusi.

==Expansions==
[[Image:Divorce money.jpg|thumb|What you are doing when you buy WOW and these expansions]]
*'''''The [[fire|Burning]] Crusade''''' - The first expansion for the game lets you go through the [[Goatse|Dark Portal]]. It also lets you go into the [[KFC|Black Temple]] and fight [[Obama|Illidan]]. You spend around $100 for the expansion and [[underageb&|prepaid game cards]] to grind your character to level 70, Jew.

*'''''Wrath of the [[Bitch|Lich]] King''''' - At about this point, Blizzard [[Irate_Gamer|gave up on ever having another original idea again]], to the point they resorted to stereotyping [[Eurofags|Europe]].  Wrath of the Lich King takes place in [[Scandinavia]], where you fight oversized hairy Vikings/Russians with fake accents that [[Sacha_Baron_Cohen|Bruno]] would put to shame. The mascot emo faggot on the boxart that everyone was excited to raid up and kill makes no useful appearance in the game other than a [[Bill O'Reilly|worthless quest giver and four scripted cutscene events]] (Unless you stayed around long enough for the fucking retarded release of ICC. Instead, it is your job to go kill frozen stone [[penis|French giants]]. You must pay $100 more to get the expansion and the separate game time. $200 if you want to get the collectors edition to get an [[Plastic Crap|in-game dragon pet]] and a [[shit nobody cares about|book]]. Going along with the theme of completely stolen content, final boss encounters consist of a rip off of [[Futurama|Professor Farnsworth]], an oversized [[Pulp_Fiction|GIMP]] with lines constructed from sound bites of Christian Bale as Batman, and [[Milhouse]]  ("BONESTORM!"). The other bosses illustrate Blizzard plagiarising from ''themselves''; a highly original '''dragon boss''', Blood Elf royalty, Kel'Thuzard with tits and ANOTHER DRAGON BUT THIS ONE'S DEAD OGM!!111!1

*'''''[[Haiti|CATaclysm]]''''' - a.k.a. "The addition which made mocking WoW cool".

[[Shit_no_one_cares_about|<s>This is the latest expansion</s>]].
An expansion to World of Whorecrack that adds [[furries|cat people]] (hence the title)
to the characters the player can choose, as well as "Whoregen," a species of slutty [[furry|werewolves]] who [[fellatio|love you long time]]. For all you [[sick fucks|normal people]] out there, just consider it the best thing since the [[military]] invented [[AIDS]], since it keeps all the [[dorks]] and [[furfags|furries]] off the streets and quarantines the [[drama]] to the [[shit|shitfest]] that is WoW.
You also get the same boring worlds from the original game with lava added.
You can also play as a [[Lol-cow|Tauren]] [[Jesus|Paladin]] in [[Final Fantasy VI|a ruined world]]. To quote Blizzard, "[[I did it for the lulz|LAWL lore]]".

[[Last thursday]], [[Cat]]-aclysm sold [[over 9000]] copies.

==[[KKK|Guilds]]==
Like [[RuneScape|every]] MMORPG, in order to see the vast majority of the game, players will need to join a guild. The purpose of a guild is to enable the guild master and his best friends to get run through the high level dungeons so they can gear up their characters, so they can go into the next dungeon and get the next set of gear for themselves. It is the responsibility of the other guild members to somehow get their own gear so they can help keep their online masters clothed in the most fashionable of equipment.

Guilds tend to be [[VideoCompiler|a great source of drama]], especially when epic loots are involved. Due to this, guilds seem to form up and dissolve every second.

Occasionally, guilds [[Die_alone|go batshit insane clearing bosses]], finishing content faster than [[Jews|Blizzard]] can hammer out. Butthurt about having to produce content while basement dwellers fork out $15 a month, Blizzard, being the Jews that they are,  decided it was more cost effective and lulz inducing to drop the [[Banhammer|Banhammer]] on such guilds [http://www.wow.com/2010/02/04/ensidia-temporarily-banned-for-exploits/] than create more content. Naturally, much drama ensued on the forums and many members threatened to stop their $15 a month subscription if their rightful loot was given back and ban's were lifted. Blizzard's response was the [[Banned|Banhammer]] to many other instigators of drama, solving many server capacity problems. 

Blizzard is also strongly opposed to debugging software, and when [[Apple|glitches]] and exploits are reported they will drop the Banhammer rather than fix anything or [[Iraq|admit their mistake]]. Whenever a [[KKK|Guild]] gets a [[fail|"World First Kill"]], they will be swiftly banned for awareness of numerous exploits. This is how the game is beta tested. This will happen repeatedly until the next 10 patches come out and no one can remember anything about it.

==[[John_F._Kennedy|Bosses]]==

All bosses in the game are picked from an extensive database of around 5 models. These skins are used over and over every patch, each patch and expansion version being slightly larger and taking on a different hue and color, and tagged with a different name such as [[Anal|Reliquary of Pain]] and [[Deepthroat|Devourer of Souls]], and voiced by the same shitty voice actor. Before fighting a boss, players will spend 30 minutes asking for [[Drugs|buffs]] over raid chat in caps, all while half the raid disconnects or leaves because net nanny turns off their internet by 9 pm. You then wait for other player's to go back and buy reagents that they forgot or get repairs. Also never get buffs from Paladins. 

So now you've engaged the boss, congratulations! You will now be introduced to the hilariously bad voice acting of MMOs. Blizzard has four different boss soundsets:

1. The Special Needs Boss - Can only say one or two words at a time verrry slooowllly, usually they are words describing what ability he's about to do or sometimes it can be related to death/a nasty sounding noun or verb, as if his thought process is so pants-on-head-retarded that he can't utter more than two syllables at once without having a brain hemorrhage. Blizzard believes this kind of dialogue is intimidating, which is a common fallacy among manchildren and retards.

2. The "Crazy" boss - this one will just talk really fast in a weird voice and say absolutely nothing of value, but just to get across the vibe that "HEY IM TALKING REALLY FAST IN A HIGH PITCHED VOICE, IS IT OBVIOUS THAT I'M INSANE? HERE LET ME SEAL THE DEAL WITH THIS MADDENING GIGGLE ARE YOU READY HERE IT COMES AHUHUHUHUHUH". Also this fight usually has a gag quote thrown in there that is a reference to whatever god-awful WoW-related meme that the WoW General forums won't shut up about just so everyone will post and go "omg did u see that, so randum!"

3. The I AM THE GENERIC LORD OF GENERIC DOOM PREPARE TO DIE boss - typically says "mortal", "power", and "death" three times in one sentence. Makes liberal use of the phrase "You cannot defeat me" and subsequent variations that inform the player that they cannot win. This is of course ironic because said boss has been on farm for the past 3 months. These voices are all done by Chris Metzen, who coincidentally voices just about everyone else in WoW.

4. The "Femme Fatale" boss - female bosses are scarce in the game because Metzen has to actually pay a female voice actor to do them (although sooner or later he'll just start doing their lines in falsetto) but where they do appear they are ALWAYS a Blood or High Elf model and ALWAYS "supposed" to be sexy, presumably because the one female voice actor Blizzard employs (aside from Judge Judy to voice Sylvanas) can't do any other kind of voice, and because for the obese 12 year old boys who make up most of the game population, tanking Grand Magus Telestra is the closest they'll ever come to a female who isn't dead or unconscious.

After downing the boss, one will realize that the lootmaster has logged off and transferred servers.

==The Official ''WoW'' Forums==
As with most [[Lie|good]] [[MMORPG]]s, ''World of Warcraft'' has its own public forums.  Subscribers can discuss tactics, roleplay, offer up item trades and sales, and of course, bitch and moan about how the game sucks and everyone should be playing ''[[Warhammer]]'' instead. (Which they SHOULD be.)  Chuck Norris jokes, horrifying roleplay, [[gay|"hug a class"]] posts, trolling posts, worthless bug reports, really STUPID suggestions for future patches...  All that and a bag of [[Shit|chips]] is what you'll find within these hollowed walls.

Guess we know what they think of us...|Mathemagical response from a roleplay geek}}</center>
Some time after the release of the second expansion pack (see above), a massive "bug" was discovered in ''World of Warcraft'' wherein people could no longer gain their epic lewts.  When a player tries to enter a dungeon portal, a large message will flash on their screen stating [[GTFO|"Additional instances cannot be launched, please try again later"]].  Most people took great offense to this as they figured since they were giving Blizzard their money, they should be entitled to do what they want when they want how they want.  The truth of the matter is that Blizzard's hardware just can't keep up with all the people "raiding" at the same time.  Naturally, people just don't want to believe this due to the fact that Blizzard takes in at least [[Over 9000|$165,000,000 USD]] a month in revenue. ($15.00/month x 11 million people.)  What people don't seem to realize is that Blizzard also wants people to [[Truth|GO OUTSIDE AND GET SOME FRESH AIR YOU FUCKING LOSERS]].

==WoW "Celebrities"==
A WoW celebrity is someone who constantly [[Attention whore|craves attention]] in the WoW universe because he/<s>she</s>/it knows they [[fail]] hard [[IRL]]. Either by saying random stuff, typing like this: '''lolz i r the prince of da serva''', trolling the forums, or just plain being [[faggots]]. There are some on every server, and that is why [[Blizzard|they added]] the /ignore console. Lecturing WoW faggots in the game results in [[The Game|losing the game]], so don't even try. However epic drama can ensue when blizzard forgets to update a class in a patch resulting in massive fail in-game for some Wow-celebs. 

WoW forum "trolls" are a unique brand of mouth breathing [[fucktards]]. Unawares that outside of the safe haven of their mothers' collective basement, they serve as a reminder that [[you]] could be worse off in life. Evidence that post-natal [[abortion]] should be legalized.

For example, [[fat|Lenox]] is a recent WoW [[failure|celebrity]]. Claiming, among other things, that Blizzard has [[Waaaambulance|offended]] him because he is a disgusting fat body.

[[Image:Blaargh.jpg|thumb|Blaargh, a forum faggot that screams for the [[Final solution|final solution.]]]]

{{morphquote|WOWfagquotes2|background-color: #ffffff; width:65%; height:250px|font-weight: bold;|While recently questing on one of my Alliance characters in Nagrand, I came across a Draenei NPC named Corki who is imprisoned by the Boulderfist Ogres. He is understandably angry, yet one of the things he says is unnecessary to his character, and too offensive for Blizzard to have in this game. He says "Hey fatso, how do you go to the bathroom with all that fat?" I find this fairly offensive.|Lenox, being a faggot

|Yes, I am extremely overweight. Yes, that is my fault, and it is something I deal with every day, yet I don't expect to find something that makes me feel horrible about myself in a video game. Maybe from the players themselves, but certainly not an NPC created by Blizzard. Since this is an anonymous outlet, I will say something that truly embarrasses me. I do have trouble using public restrooms due to my weight problem. Usually, using the toilet at other people's houses is out of the question. I have a specially created toilet in my house. This is something I wish I could change, and probably could if I were a better person, yet I still expect better treatment from Blizzard.|Lenox, being a faggot.

|I am a virgin. This will never change. 
I failed a course in college because, on exam day, the elevator was out of service and the classroom was on the 3rd floor. I was too afraid to even attempt to walk up the stairs, for fear of what others would think of me. I held my cursor over the "Post" button for 10 minutes, thinking about if I should even post this thread. Why? Because I knew how horribly I'd be treated. Even though none of you will likely ever see me, I am still afraid of what you think of me.|Lenox, being a virgin.}}</center>

Congratulations on your celebrity status. [[GG]].

==Reality==
[[Image:Dinorider.jpg|thumb|How a WoW player invisions themselves in real life.]]
What most WoW faggots don't realize is that they are paying for a copy of ''Diablo II'' mixed with ''[[EverQuest]]'', and made to look like ''Warcraft'' (as evident by the obvious direct usage of ''Diablo II'''s skill tree and many skills and game mechanics taken directly from ''Diablo II''). Eventually Blizzard plans to release a huge patch that will troll most WoWers into oblivion by changing WoW into ''[[Diablo III]]'' online.

==Sex==
[[Image:WoWWhore.jpg|right|thumb|The only way most WoW players could ever get laid.]]
[[Image:wowfurry1.jpg|right|thumb|A typical Wow furfag insisting that animals are fun.]]
[[Image:wowfurry2.jpg|right|thumb]]
[[Image:wowwhoreforgold.jpg|right|thumb|One of the fastest ways for low level females to make gold on Wow.]]


Although WoW faggots never engage in heterosex [[IRL]], they often “[[rape|Pwn]]” or “[[rape|gank]]” each other within the game when not standing around cities shouting "LFG..." or "WTS..." [[rape|PVP]] has become such a dominant force in WoW that new [[rape|PVP]] servers are being opened all the time, including [[gay|RP-PVP]] servers.

One of the reasons WoW faggots abstain from sex is that they prefer to be with “[[otherkin|their own kind]]”, but since WoWers rarely leave their homes (busy with the [[Serious_business|srs biz raiding]]), this is thought to be a filthy lie. In short, [[Baby Grace|it's better that they don't breed]].  

==Porn==
Take your pick:

*[[lulz|Horrific]] [http://www.whorelore.com/ live-action] WoW porn
*Horrific [http://www.furnation.com/black_rabbit/porncraft.htm drawn] WoW porn
*Horrific [http://porncraftwow.com/ drawn, live-action and 3D] WoW porn

==[[Shit|Blizzcon]], Also Where Nobody Gets Laid==
Occasionally WoW players will leave their homes for what the blue names call “Blizzcon”, and what WoW players call "5\/\/337 d00d". Here, a large number of "WoW patients" can be seen. Their complications are diverse - ranging from mild conditions such as Carpal Tunnel and [[Leetspeak]], to a severe case of [[ugly]].  

''Sometimes'' attractive people can be seen at a Blizzcon claiming to be WoW faggots. These are not really WoW faggots; they are models paid by Blizzard to appear at these pathetic vomit-inducing functions.

Blizzcon features a wide variety of activities;
*Class Q+A: a forum for people who play hunters to make death threats to Metzen whenever playing their class approaches any kind of difficulty, and for ret paladins to complain that every class but them is OP because they died twice in a WSG last year.
*Lore Q+A: exactly as retarded as it sounds; a bunch of chinless, manboob-sporting retards screeching at Mezten because <strike>Thrall's</strike> Jaina's left testicle is saggier in-game than it's described as being in the official novels.
*Dance Competition: an assortment of spastic, bony individuals who either do an extremely easy dance from the game or fail horribly at a more difficult one. On occasion a morbidly obese person will attempt one of the more athletic dances. The result is rather like watching a plane crash.
*Costume Contest: these deeply unattractive people are paraded in front of the crowd; the usual assortment being obese men in their twenties wearing paladin gear clearly made from ceral boxes; ugly girls who clearly worked very hard on their costumes but get no applause because they're not physically attractive, and sluts with shitty costumes who get a standing ovation because you can see their nipples, causing most of the crowd to go into a sort of feeding-frenzy.

The only reason to go to this convention is to seal the deal on finally quitting WoW, realizing that these are the [[Zombies|horrible people]] you have been playing with.

[[image:Taurenorcthang.jpg|thumb|WoW creatures at play.]]

==Roleplaying Servers==
[[Roleplaying]] servers are hotbeds of [[gay]] Internet sex, thinly disguised as heterosexual or lesbian relations through the power of the Internets. When a nerd just cannot sit down with himself and come to terms with the fact that he is most likely cybering other men, he turns to roleplaying servers so that he can pretend ''better''. Roleplaying servers spawn such people as [[Adella]] and her many [[Faggots|sugar daddies]]. [http://dramatis-personae.com/ Communities] like this one have risen from this type of shit and it's best [[you]] avoid them. Thanks to the Druid Class the Roleplaying servers are also very popular with [[furfags]].

Since only [[Unwarranted_self_importance|Blizzard employees]] and people with [[luser|VIP accounts]] can use the command to make the characters [[rape]] everyone else, they use [[hacker|add-ons]] such as FagRSP to advertise to each other their willingness to mate. It's something like [[IRL]] [[gays]] posting pictures of their cocks on [[Hotornot]], but with much more abuse of the English language. [[Some argue]] FagRSP users are the greatest source of [[drama]] and [[lulz]] in the game, and [http://rottenapples.talisancreations.com/ multiple people] have continued to [http://roleplayerslament.com milk the lol cow] much to the delight of lulz enthusiasts.

[[Darknest]] is also based around the pathetic [[faggots]] who beat off to naked night elves dancing on mail boxes. While there are many ERP (Erotic Role Play) guilds on many servers, [[Antonia Bayle|Scarlet Crusade]] is known to have the highest population of these unwashed losers. If you play on that server you (or move to that server after reading this) you're a faggot and need to be euthanized.

==Datecraft==
Because people [[Lonely|get lonely]], roleplaying servers get boring, and slave trading and auctions are so inaccurate, certain ''World of Warcraft'' players would join up on sites such as Babblesex and whatever happens to be in the adspace to your left. Then people looking for more took it upon themselves to make an ''[[OKCupid]]''-like dating site dedicated to people looking to [[Fuck|hook up]] [[IRL|in real life]] and play the game they love so much together. Thus, [http://datecraft.com/ Datecraft] was born unto the world! The self-proclaimed "video game dating realm", had originally focused on ''World of Warcraft'' players, but due to [[Shit nobody cares about|popular demand]], it has since expanded to other online games like ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'' and ''[[IMVU]]''.

==Addiction==

{{main|MMORPG Freak Out}}

[[Image:WOWFAG.jpg|thumb|The only thing left for this WoWfag is a [[final solution]].]]

Sufferers of the WoW addiction commonly refer to themselves as “WoWers”, “[[gamers|GamerZ]]”, or in the most severe cases as “Alliance” or “Horde”. 

WoW addiction goes through several phases, [[Fact|similar to the psychobiological phases of chemical drug addictions]]. This should comes as no surprise, as the Blizzard employees are [[Lie|reportedly]] paid in [[crack]]. WoW takes several steps beyond mundane addictions, with increasingly unstable behavior. If you have a friend or colleague whom you suspect of being a WoW addict, it is important to carefully gauge their level of addiction [[Murder|before taking any other action.]]

* Check their room for a “WoW” box, subscription card, or wrist brace. Often early signs such as this can make all the difference, since while it's unlikely they will be cured, you can take action to prevent friends and loved ones from being [[Left 4 Dead|infected]].

* If you happen to walk in on a WoWer during on of their sessions, (as is most likely the case since that’s about all they ever do), [[DO IT FAGGOT|DO NOT and I repeat '''DO NOT''']], interrupt the game. He may try to [[Pwn|gank]] you with his replica sword he got at the Renfaire.  

* It's entirely possible that you may catch a WoWer during an intense masturbation session (typically mid-cyber in the tram). You have been warned.

* From bank statements, see if they're buying from Chinese gold farmers. If you find this to be the case, you can be sure their addiction has taken precedence over any other financial considerations, and should immediately remove any items of value from anywhere in the area. Don't worry, they'll be too busy grinding to stop you.

* Severe addicts will commonly be in the habit of [[Shit|shitting]] in socks so as not to leave one's seat and thus get ganked by some level 23 loser. These hopeless cases are referred to as "poopsockers", and should be '''[[Kill_it_with_fire|terminated with extreme prejudice]].'''

There are but four cures for WoW addiction:
* Their [[suicide|self extermination]]. Preferably through fire. 
* Assisted extermination by a merciful soul. Preferably through fire.  
* Having a shred of willpower, and selling your account for [[Jew_gold|many real dollars]] to some more-addicted sucker. Then you can buy [[Delicious_cake|delicious cake]].
* Make them play ''[[Darkfall]]'' for a week. They'll be sure to never play MMORPGs ever again!

Players spend countless hours over this game. It will be hard to break them of their addiction, but in rare cases, if they [[Self pwn|kill themselves]] like [[Shawn Woolley]] did with EQ, you can Lysol their PC down and sell it. Sometimes some [[fags]] kill themselves [[Mitchell_Henderson|just because they get so attached to it]].

*There is however a risk with breaking a WoW players addiction by force. Certain [[13 year old boys|under 18 players]] are prone to extreme meltdowns on the scale of [[Rage|Chernobyl]]. Scientists point to this phenomenon triggering when said players parents deny access to ''World of Warcraft''. It is highly recommended that anyone living within the vicinity of said players immediately [[GTFO|evacuate]].

==Slavery==

[[Image:1271802961179.jpg|thumb|right|fuck dose whiteys ben racist1111]]

Modern [[slaves|slavery]] is known as "Gold Farming" and is intended to keep the [[China|Yellow menace]] down. When the [[United States]] banned slavery, [[Fact|it was a very sad time for slave owners.]] Later, the black person started to demand [[White guilt|reparations]], so something ''simply had to be done.'' [[The Man]] decided that slavery had to be moved offshore, to ensure continued economic prosperity for [[Microsoft]].

Farming has been around since before the Internet, but nobody could ever figure out how to grow money until ''[[Ultima_online|Ultima Online]]'' was invented. It isn't known who made the initial breakthrough, but it's thought that [[Jews|Alan Greenspan's lackeys]] were primarily responsible, since only they could have conceived of such a brilliantly sick and perverse means of enriching themselves. However, the advent of the practice was probably inevitable, since despite their addiction, WoWers often find themselves unable to play 24 hours a day and must find another way to continue while they sleep, eat, or go to the bathroom. So, for [[math|$0.50]] per hour, a [[irony|barely-educated]] [[Zombie|commie]] living in a sweaty room will play WoW for them. Needless to say, the commie himself earns roughly [[wat|$0.05 per week.]]

Sometimes it's difficult for players to distinguish the gold-field workers from monkeys or robots. They often repeat the same mistakes and speak gibberish (like monkeys!) Work is being done to translate some of their [[moonspeak]]. Know your Chinaman by these phrases: "''ni hao''," "''[Krol Blade] ok??''," "''water 1g?''," "''is 4 guildie''," "''deal giev ok??10g''," and "''tusoNgaMe $5 4 2thousand free!''"

Those that speak English become the "boss boss" and take all the money, while the slaves do all the work. 

==On Private Servers==
Private servers were available for [[Nigra|poor people]], and [[4chan|unemployed losers]] that can't/won't pay $15 per month for the retail version. Most servers featured larger numbers of item drops from monsters and higher rates of experience, because everyone knows that a [[13-year-old boy]] that thought about it for ten minutes knows about gameplay and balance better than Blizzard's professional staff who spent years developing the game.

The big downside of private servers is that no one that ran a private server actually knows shit about how the game works, so they made changes by letting their [[cat]] walk on their keyboard to see what happened. While some cats are known to be excellent administrators, most of them are still just [[retarded]]. And then, [http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/12/05/blizzard-legal-targets-private-servers/ Blizzard targeted the fuck out of private servers. Oops.]

==Trolling Techniques==

[[Image:Wikipedousersmall.png|thumb|Showing those fucking paladins how it's done.]]

These generate various effects - some bring [[win|lulz]] and some just [[fail]]. Experiment and find your own lulz. However, Blizzard, like most companies, disabled trade/chatroom from trial accounts, because of [[Chink]] gold farmers. A paid account is required for the best effort in [[lulz]].

# Set auto follow on new players; for whatever reason this really pisses people off.
# Join parties for dungeons as a healer and then leave about halfway through without saying anything. It works very well. Bonus points if you leave while your group is fighting the last boss of the dungeon
# Lead a party into an instance and then randomly boot players from it.
# Start listing the name of movies with "Murloc" in the title like ''Indiana Murloc and The Temple of Doom'' or ''Debbie Does Murloc''.
# If Horde, start shit with people in Barrens chat. It's a non-PvP area filled with low level players, so they can't hurt you or retaliate. You can troll to your heart's content.
# Join battlegrounds at the lowest level possible, and start talking shit about how people have no fucking idea how to play the game. 
# Ninja any piece of loot. This will require a time investment, but if you steal the right piece of loot, you will ignite a shitstorm of drama that should keep you entertained for at least five minutes. [[true|'''You CANNOT get banned for this''']]
# Tell people what to do, and when they say you have no idea what you're on about, retaliate with "Your such a noob, I have five level 80's and three Death Knights, I know what I'm talking about".
# When using the auction house, be sure to put up shit people need without buyout. Then pull it off the auction house before it sells - this is essentially the closest any WoW player gets to the [[rape|transfer of goods between consenting individuals]].
# Announce in trade chat that [name of player] is [[bullshit|quitting WoW forever and is giving all their gold to the first person who whispers them!]]
# Ninja a [[WTF|Bloody Apron]] as a rogue from a [[Jesus|priest]] who doesn't need it but will [[fail|whine]] to their guild to boot that [[rape|rogue]]
# Link any item in trade chat, and state that the last person to link the same item will receive a large sum of gold.
# When in dungeons as a hunter or rogue, use Misdirection or Tricks of the Trade on a healer and attack a large group of enemies.
# Play as a warlock and fear inside an instance, lulz and rage will insue.
# [[Caps lock|Bitch loudly]] about how you can't spend achievement points.
# Spam trade chat with Anal then a spell, ability, quest, achievement etc 
# Note that ''[[RuneScape]]'' is a much superior online game.
# Point them to [[Wowflames]].com!
# As a priest, use Mind Control on other players when dueling on locations that have cliffs you can jump off and/or while waiting for zeppelins / boats to leave.
#[[????]]
#[[PROFIT]]!!!!

==Beware, Blizzard narcs you out to the cops==
A man wanted for marijuana possession [[fail|fled the country]].  He continued playing ''World of Warcraft'' and so [[Blizzard Entertainment]] narced him out.  He was caught and brought back to the USA. [http://kotaku.com/5437861/blizzard-helps-cops-track-down-wow-fan-suspected-drug-dealer Read Here]
