"Screechin Mad"   Merlock

Merlock is a planet of the apes style monkey man who is a lot like H.M Murdock,  often the demolitions expert and sometimes utterly insane.

T. Bone

T Bone is a rock monster who looks similar to Schnitzel from the tv show Chowder,  in terms of personality and mannerisms he is a lot like B.A Barracus and even talks like his actor Mr T.
