Ted Williams, better known as the '''Homeless DJ''' (or [[Howard Stern|'Radio Man']], if you're a local [[cop]]) or '''The Homeless Man With The Golden Voice''', from Columbus, Ohio, was recently exploited for [[YouTube|channel-views]] by a local news station, but turned it into a [[win]].  A cross between [[MMA|Bruce Buffer]] and Barack Obama, this homeless [[addict|ex-druggie]] has won the [[goatse|heart of the internet]], a job, and a house by enunciating clearly and not sounding like a black person. He really used to be a Cleveland radio DJ  until he fucked it up with drugs and alcohol, like all niggers.

[[File:CavaliersLogo.gif|thumb|It could be worse - he could be in [[Philadelphia|Philly]].  You think the 76'ers have that kind of cash?]]
Whether or not GOD is to blame for his popularity or not, it's easy to say that people will go Jesus-crazy and get extremely preachy with anyone who says anything other than [[unfunny|"JEEZUS LUVZ U GAWD BLESS."]]

As a journalist you failed, as a human being you took advantage of somebody unfortunate. It undermines the very fabric of Ted's story and you should [[an hero|be ashamed]].|-SRS YouTuber ''(goodolarchie)''}}

No comments on Ted in the comments section of this video though! Looks like Ted will have his 20 days of popularity. Sooner or later, he'll let it all go to his head and [[Antoine Dodson|completely fucking overdo it.]] Hopefully, he'll provide enough entertainment to distract us from [[Comedy Central|the war in Iraq]]. Let's start the countdown to [[lulz|relapse]]!

Update: Ted Williams has checked himself into rehab, <strike>post-arrest</strike> after the police let him off with a warning and Dr. Phil had a heart to heart with Ted. Maybe they can also rehabilitate his worsening case of USI as well, even though it's unlikely as the only cure for USI is a lead [[an hero|aspirin]].

==Family Life==

After apparently not seeing his family in five years, Ted was gloriously reunited with them. He promptly ordered some grey goose before beating the shit out of all of them. He went on to call his daughter a fat bitch and punch her in the face. The next day he appeared on [[Dr. Phil]] for a [http://youblowthis.ytmnd.com/ little more exploitation.] He is now off to rehab.
