Pikabellechu is a [[tartlet]], [[furfag]], [[otakukin]], and [[Cosplayfucks|cosplayfuck]] all-star all rolled into one.  Upon viewing her [[DeviantART]] page one will realize that she is a [[sick fuck|twisted]] [[Pokemon]] [[otaku]] and was born solely to provide [[lulz]] for her viewers at her own expense.<br>

==Her Gallery==
[[Image:Pikabellechufursuiting.jpg|thumb|left|An inaccurate illustration of Pikabellechu and her [[bitch|boyfriend]] in traditional [[furry]] wedding attire.]]  While her [[DeviantART]] page does not have journals to provide any further [[lulz]] (you can just read [http://pikabellechu.livejournal.com/ Her LJ Page] anyways), her gallery displays a lulzy blend of shitty furry art and photos of her and her [[bitch|boyfriend]] in [[cosplay]] as a wide variety of characters.  Your childhood shall not remained [[rape|unraped]] as you look over her gallery and see all the [[Pokemon]], [[Disney]], and [[Nintendo]] characters Pikabellechu has [[rape|cosplayed]] as.<P>'''''Beware: viewing her gallery will cause blindness (with a chance of lulz).'''''


==RL Pikabellechu==
Her face and "artwork" are so ugly the combination of the two could kill cancer. She enjoys making her [[13-year-old boy|boyfriend]] dress up as [[gay]] cosplay characters so she can [[buttsecks|fuck him in the ass]] when [[rape|he least expects it]]. She's spent [[over 9000]] dollars creating her [[shit|shitty]] costumes, to wear them once, brag, and make a new one. When she isn't pretending to be her retarded [[pokemon]] persona, she's pretending to be Xena, Belle (from Beauty and the Beast) or some other queer shit. For those parents who would [[rape]] their children's future, Pikabellechu is availabe to perform at birthday parties. She is so [[retard]]ed she's collected over 8,000 pikachu collectibles and bought one of the official Pokemon Pikachu Cars. She named it PikaBug. 
She goes to over 9,000 Conventions acting like she's some the superstar guest; but in reality, nobody knows who the fuck she is. Perfect time to do some IRL trolling.

==Evidence of her faggotry==

She posted this:

{{Quote|Ok I'm glad you all love my Pikachu Collection...You know I think it is utterly disturbing how none of you know me or anything and like to judge people just cause what they do or collect, No wonder why this world is going to hell and People are Killing each other..I can see why...This is utter BS, do you see me commenting on LJ's about what people think or feel..or posting it all over the net so people can mock you...You may think Pikachu is just a animated character but to me its not just that..I do alot of promotional work for Pokemon and as part of my job I go to schools, daycares, hospitals and so on to bring joy to kids who think that this animated character is real...Damn I hate Barney and Wiggles and shit like that but I do not Diss people who think it may be retarded stupid immature or whatnot...I happen to like Pikachu and through a period of 9 years have collected all of this because I am proud what I do..Damn I hate for you all to see my Beauty and the Beast collection then, Its more then my pikachu one...But thats besides the point..and you think what I do is weird have you ever stopped and seen the world out there, believe me there are people who collect a hell of alot more then me, and hey do you see me diss them and mock them for what they like...We only live once in this world and its a shame people have to be the way they are... |Pikabellechu|[http://keithdevens.com/weblog/archive/2005/Jan/04/Pikachu KeithDevens.com]}}

In a [[tl;dr]] response to a comment about Pikachu being [[drugs|heroin]]. Like all [[lulz]]y 'artistic' [[internet]]z [[fag]]s, she is very [[Aspergers|misunderstood]].

==Unwarranted Self-Importance?==
She is likely to suffer from [[unwarranted self-importance]].You'd think that because she helps society by attending birthday parties and convincing kids that Pikachu is real, she's humbler than your underage Mary-Sue. NOPE. If you look at her DeviantART page, it flatly states that her favorite artist is herself. And since the brain starts losing brain cells steadily after 30 years old, it is highly unlikely that she will ever be able to return from zippity fucking doo dah land. And still, she feels helpful. Yeah right.

==Oh Shit==
{{quote|IT'S 100% OFFICIAL I AM IN THE GUINESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS DATABASE!!!!!!!I have been waiting for this email for months now since April when I sent in everything. Just got the email like 5 minutes ago and they are sending me my certificate and it's not 100% but they are considereing me to also be in the Book in 2009..They only select a few who made it this far and have been accepted so I'm crossing my fingers that I will also be featured in the book itself which I'm pretty sure I will be cause they really loved all the photo's I sent and it's not just my collection that makes it world known but also my love and dedication to Pokemon by all the costumes I have made and events world wide I have done in Pokemon's name.....I am so freaking excited and it's taken me months to get this far, Just counting every single item over a course of three months was so much work and all the paperwork and legal things you had to do.....But OMG it's been so worth it to now officialy say I am the world's record holder for having the biggest Pokemon collection in the world.....}}

==Hahaha, oh wow! Really?==

On September 20th,At the AWA anime convention, PikaBelleChu was proposed to by her just as creepy boyfriend, Dr. Anime. After cheating in her own game to win the grand prize, her boyfriend pulled out one of those Burger King Pokeballs (you know, the ones that those little kids could suffocate on) and popped out a ring to propose. PikaBelleChu, being as pathetic as she is, said yes. A thousand furry banshee screams were let out and deafened, blinded, or killed anyone sane.  Let's all hope they're sterile.
