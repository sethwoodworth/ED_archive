ED Exodus into The Promised Land
==ED Exodus into [[The Promised Land]]==
Hearing the praises of The Promised Land sung on high and from every YouTube vlogger of note, a band of brave young [[EDiot]]s made their way from the seamy urban e-sprawl of [[YouTube]] in hope of a better, brighter tomorrow. A tomorrow full of luv and [[lulz]] where they could be accepted and cherished as the [[furry|unique and special butterflies]] they are.

On the first day, all was wonderful and the EDiots joyously celebrated their newfound home, posting videos and reuniting with their fellows. Together they began building a happy little enclave, secure in the [[hugbox|warm and friendly environs]] of The Promised Land.

===Diaspora===

But lo, and woe unto the EDiots, for such happiness was not to be. Their time in Paradise was cut short. As they frolicked unaware in the shiny and widget-filled Web 2.0 wonder of LiveVideo, the dark beast in its fascist [[underbelly]] was aroused. Why, these were not [[emo]] [[hipster]]s or [[fat]] [[basement dwelling]] [[nerd]]s. Fearing this new immigration, LiveVideo struck quickly and viciously and without warning. The [[banhammer]] fell upon the unsuspecting and there was wailing and gnashing of teeth.

Thus the EDiots were expelled from Paradise and forced to wander the cold and unfriendly [[internets]], all the while fighting to regain The Promised Land.

===Reclamation===

But lo, a small band of EDiots escaped the flaming might of the banhammer and at this moment are locked in a frantic battle to reclaim a foothold in the Promised Land. For this is the Internets! and all should be allowed to move freely through its vast, wondrous expanses (except for [[furries]] who are an abomination and must be banished to the Basement of Eternal Darkness). The battle still rages.

Slowly but surely, the ragtag resistance group are fighting back the swathe of anti-ED sentiment in the Promised Land, and presently request anyone wishing to aid the cause to [[get on irc fgt|get on irc]] with any email addresses of the President, CEO or Administrators of Live Video.

===Let My People Go===
And the EDiots spoke unto The Denizens of The Promised Land, and said "Verily we come to you in peace, our brethren." But there were, vipers dwelling among The Righteous who sought to use the EDiots to their own ends. 

"Look upon these newcomers not as your fellow but as your Enemy," cried [[Violetkitty411]] unto her followers, "for they are Unrighteous and never must they be free." For Violetkitty411 feared that the true Righteousness of the Disciples of the Lulz would turn the LiveVideans from her false prophesy if they were allowed to frolic unchecked. "Do not listen to their Damnable Lies," she proclaimed, "gather close and heed unto My Law and I shall keep you safe."

And the EDiots cried out to The Great [[LOL]], "O LOL, hear us in this, our Time Of Need and help these LiveVideans to see through these Charlatans and behold our Righteousness." And The Great LOL heard the cries of his children and spoke to those that would drive them from The Promised Land.
