[http://www.emoscene.com www.emoscene.com], is a website where [[emos]], [[fags]], [[scene]] kids, antidepressant addicts, [[asperger's syndrome|socially awkward]], and anyone with straight dyed hair congregate to post pictures they took of themselves looking away from the camera and talk about [[lie|how hard their lives are]]. [[some argue|It is hypothesized that]] they need to take the pictures themselves because they don't have enough friends to take the picture for them. Another theory is that they don't know how to set a timer on their camera. It is not advised that you visit the website, as the high levels of radiating [[faggotry]] have proven lethal to normal people.

==The Forum==
[[Image:emoo.jpg|thumb|example of an emo]][[Image:findingemos.jpg|thumb|this site is used to find other emos]]
The emoscene forum is divided into nine subforums. The most active being '''insane ramblings'''. This forum is described as general discussion and consists mainly of threads discussing whether or not they should make threads in which to rant about their emotions, debate if hair should flip left or right, and compare techniques for cutting their wrists with razors. It is ironic since none of them have the balls to take even a paper cut anyways. Another popular subforum is the poetry forum '''words are weapons'''. This is a real excerpt from a typical post in this forum:

 Kill me, Let us both dieâ™¥ #01
 "i open my arms to you, come to my embrace, let's be together tonight, and die together as the 
 sunrise comes. don't you agree? give  me the pills, i need more, here take some to. now let's 
 make love. "  -Posted by user Self_X_tacy

Notice the lack of capital letters, as well as the inability to differentiate a period from a comma. Also notice the wrong "to" is used.

==Attention Everyone on the Internets from Emoscene.com User, "I QUIT"==

If you've signed up for Emoscene.com and need to make an [[anal|exit]]. Here is the correct formula of words:  

<div style="background-color: #fafaf5; border: 1px dashed blue; padding: .5em; width: 33%;">
''26.05.2008 "TO FUCKING CASSANDRA:''<br/>

Apparently, this [http://www.emoscene.com/xJEFFYx xJEFFYx] was upset about an uncooked hamburger giving him [[shit|anal leakage]]. He was so upset it was only fair he decided to delete his account due to a [[shit|dooky]] smeared keyboard.

==Skepticism==
The first reaction of most sensible people upon entering the site is how can real people frequently interact in such a heinous manner? They assume that it might be an elaborate [[troll]] site. This unfortunately is not true, emoscene is all too real. There are a few unconfirmed theories about how ordinary humans could behave in this manner.

[[Image:Emologic.JPG|thumb|[[Divide by zero|This makes perfect sence]]]]

*Their parents don't beat them enough.
*Their parents beat them too much.
*The excessive exposure to hair dye has somehow penetrated their scalps and caused brain damage.
*They truly are misunderstood and this is how they express themselves.

The last theory has been disregarded by most scientists, including [[Stephen Hawking]].

Emo and Scene people suck COOOOOCKKKSSS.

==The Solution==
[[Image:Emoscenetroll.jpg|thumb|We need [[moar]] of this]]
The only viable solution to this massive source of [[anti-lulz]] is [[epic]] [[troll|trolling]], [[epic]][[spam|spamming]], and [[epic]] [[pwn|pwning.]] This is similar to [[hitler]]'s [[final solution]], however with [[moar]] [[lulz]] and less [[fail]]. To join the war-effort, register at their forum and do your part. Threads about [[lunchmeats]], [[star wars]], and [[Shitting_Rainbows|being happy]] are encouraged. Any thread [[epic|worthy]] of [[lulz]] is enough to provoke the desired reaction. To be more educated on [[emo]]s and how to [[troll]] them, see:[[emo]]
