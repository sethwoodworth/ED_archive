The YouTube Civil War of [[2006]] was one of the most successful, far-reaching, and undeniably noble [[trolling]] operations in the history of [[YouTube]], and thus it is that any individual or organization who seeks to conduct such an operation in the future would be wise to take its lessons to heart. To this end, a general summary of the hostilities is presented here. The following account is of course limited in both scope and exactitude by the inevitable "fog of war."

== Discovery of the [[lol-cow]] == 
An EDiot named [[User:Wattage|Wattage]] finds a video while lurking on [[YouTube]]. He notices a woman named [[PeppermintPatti]] crying over [[rape|trivial bullshit]], and the potential for [[lulz]] as she is a fugly Dyke which does equal a Lollercoaster in the near future.

== Reinforcement ==
He then notices a response by CupNJava called "The Defective Bear", where a woman commemorates a [[weblog|vlog]] of a story read aloud, with "The Rose" by Bette Midler played in the background.

== Documentation ==
Unable to hold in the [[lulz]] anymore, [[EDiot]]s posts their findings on [[ED]].  [[Cyllene]] and [[Janus Zeal]] were able to keep meticulous reports and backups of all video.

== Breaking through enemy lines ==
Wattage spams the ED link to all of [[PeppermintPatti]]â€™s subscribers.

== Declaration of War ==
Her subscribers create a flurry of videos in a vain attempt to deter and humiliate Wattage.  ED users come together and create videos mocking the angry subscribers.  This was when the true lulz began:

* [[PixelBeeProductions|Battle of PixelBeeProductions]]
* [[Argent009|Battle of Argent009]]

== The Outcome ==
On December 18th, 2006 the house of [[Joseph Evers]] was raided by the [[Youtube Street Team]].  [[Einsidler]]'s body was found brutally raped and murdered in a dumpster.  Tragically, as all fat white people look the same, [[Einsidler]] was mistaken for [[wattagecat]].  A [[internet detective|detective]] found these [[internet settlement]] checks in the drawer:
