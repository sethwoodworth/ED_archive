Sometime in 2009, cable television's reality show channel, [[MTV]], decided to add a new spin to its [[lie|successful]] Real World formula of throwing a bunch of douchebags in a house and filming the results.  It's like a free trip to your local zoo, only you stay at home and watch dumber [[humans|animals]] while feeling your fat ass grow on your living room couch.  With this shit show, eight incomplete [[faking it|Italian-Americans]] were kidnapped and taken to Seaside Heights, New Jersey, to spend the summer [[fail|doing what they do]].  The result, which first aired on December 3, 2009, [[sarcasm|was the most amazing thing ever seen on television]]. Some found this as good and entertaining show others found this to be a sign of the apocalpyse, which brings us forward to 2012, where culture, creativity, and humanity no longer exist and the only network left on TV is MTV which plays on a continous loop, until even those who were a fan of the show are now saying they would rather watch Beavis and Butthead, as they had a more meanful message to send to those that are still alive and havent killed themselves to having to subjected to faggy italian douchebags. Never mind the fact that MTV pissed off (and on) many different Italian-American groups, the ratings and money this shit show pulled in was good enough to afford high-quality lawyers to win their lawsuits!  [[Scientology|Scientists]] predicted that this [[goatse|cultural landmark]] would set the tone for the 2010s, much as [[9/11]] was a defining moment of the 2000s. Everyone on [[tv/|/tv/]] loves the show, except for [[pedo|Kaiji]], because it doesn't have any [[Lolicon|8 year olds on it]].  Also, [[Gawker]] live-blogs and then recaps every episode.

As of <s>9/11</s> [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i8ee6fde4efa3c4bf23188a9bfafd116a September 10, 2010], MTV has added two more seasons of Jersey Shore (or <b>The New Jersey Life of Macaroni Rascals</b>, as it is known in [[Japan]]) to their schedule, because they are making serious [[cash|bank]] with the insanely high ratings Season Two has been getting.

==The Mutant Cast==
[[File:The_Shitfaced-tion.gif|thumb|200px|Totally [[Cocaine|not high]]]]
[[File:Jwowwhappy.gif|thumb|200px|left|Cock goes where?]]

'''Angelina [[Unrealistic Expectations|"Jolie"]] Pivarnick''' (Age 22) ''[[Guido|Staten Island, New York]]'' -  Professional whore/bartender once quoted saying she was "the Kim Kardashian of Staten Island" due to her [[fat|"all natural"]] [[ass|figure]]. Constantly bitched and moaned, almost to a point people thought that she was more likely a Jew than a [[Wop]]. Got into fights with everyone, namely the [[Steroids|'roided]] alpha-males in the house (Pauly D being an easy target), and had to break up with her boyfriend within the first episodes of Season 1 because she could [[Lesbian|no longer stand men]]. She was kicked out of the house after she refused to do [[Sandwich|simple jobs]] to [[Buttsex|pay her rent]].

'''Jenni "[[Whore|JWoww]]" [[Irish|Farley]]''' (Age 23) ''[[Mick|Franklin Square, New York]]'' - [[DeviantArt]] draw-bitch and pole-dancer who also dabbled in the fine art of [[Anna Nicole Smith|gold-digging]]. Fucked Pauly D all the time, [[whore|despite having a boyfriend]] and Pauly D being very obviously gay for The Situation. Eventually broke up with her boyfriend after she realized that life as a beard/fuckdoll for a bunch of pissed-off "club DJs" pays a lot better than slumming with another artfag.

[[File:Snooki_raving.gif|thumb|200px|Snooki clearly having a seizure]]
<br/>
[[File:Ronniedancing.gif|thumb|200px|left|[[Guido]] Mating Ritual]]

'''Michael [[Drama|"The Situation"]] Sorrentino''' (Age 27) ''[[Guido|Staten Island, New York]]'' - AKA [[Cooldude|Guido Jesus]] in the flesh. He's an assistant manager at a gym in Staten Island, gets any bitch he wants, and makes off like a thief as a [[Liar|"sensitive"]] Guido. He was finally offered a promotion to manager after Season 2, but a trial period at the helm was a dismal failure due to his inability to [[Retard|read or complete simple math equations]]. A [[Whore|private tutor]] was hired for the meat-head, who approached the dilemma by making Mike count fist-pumps, grenades, and his own abs. The Situation causes 2/3rds of all the male drama on the show, usually [[IDIFTL|for shits and giggles]] because, really, who the fuck is going to mess with him? He mentions in one of the episodes that he's an ex-male stripper, as well. Yet another thing to add to the list of things he's done that [[you]] will never accomplish. [[USI|He's also the best-paid member of the cast]], making upwards of [[OVER 9000|''$60,000 an episode'']], and supplements this unwarranted wealth with all the money he makes from his gym, promotional deals with Vitamin Water, a [[porn|workout]] video to get [[cock|sweet abs]], and was [http://www.okmagazine.com/2010/08/ok-exclusive-the-situation-his-abs-join-dancing-with-the-stars/ recently confirmed for "Dancing with the Stars"], bringing his total bank-roll this year to almost '''5 MILLION DOLLARS''' (more on this later in the article). If there is a [[God]], he's [[Trolls Trolling Trolls|trolling us all]].

'''Nicole [[Oompa Loompa|"Snooki"]] (or '''[[Fatass|Snickers]]''') Mexican''' (Age 21) ''Mexican'' via ''[[Chile]]'' - A [[SSP|self-proclaimed]] "guidette" who's obsessed with [[cock|pickles]] and going to a technical school to work on animals (or get access to some delicious [[Awesome|Ketamine]] and animal [[Steroids|growth hormones]] for her friends, [[some argue|one is not really sure]]). She's an ex-[[pro-ana]], and judging from how fat she is now, one wonders why she stopped. One thing she never threw up or refused is a Guido dicking, which is literally the only reason the rest of the cast keeps her around - she will, has, and wants to fuck every last Guido on this blue marble. She's also the bitch that gets punched in one of the classic episodes for running her whore mouth around like a drunken, orange ape. Usually, she makes ends meet by taking a fist full of sand, shoving it into her vagina, letting it ferment in there for 2-3 days before [[Queef|queefing]] out pearls to sell at the local pawn shops. This same technique was first patented by Kim Kardashian. Perhaps the fatass of Jersey Shore, [[Fact|it has been revealed that she has an eating disorder]]. [http://www.thatsfit.com/2010/01/20/jersey-shores-snooki-battled-an-eating-disorder/ No, seriously.]

[[File:Fist-pump-vinny.gif|thumb|200px|Doesn't afraid of pit-stains]]
[[File:Sammipoint.gif|thumb|200px|left|Sammi being a bitch]]
[[File:Duckphone.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Duckphone > [[Duckroll]]]]

'''Paul [[Earrape|"DJ Pauly D"]] DelVecchio''' (Age 28) ''[[Guido|Johnston, Rhode Island]]'' - A half-assing club DJ from Rhode Island who is the cause of most misery and all STDs within the group during Season 1, and likely Season 2. He's constantly trying to be the alpha-male in the house, which is a bit amusing to watch when he's half the height of Mike and half the size of Vinny. Most of this may stem from the fact he's the oldest, but he's also the [[redundant|dumbest, slowest, and most easily tricked]] into doing things for the rest of the group. HEAVILY abused for his cash by the rest of the cast, which could be the only reason they keep this [[wigger]] retard around. Also suspected of knowing the true identity of the now infamous [[Puppy_Pitcher|'Puppy Pitcher']].


'''Ronnie [[Chris Benoit|"Roid-Rage"]] Ortiz-Magro''' (Age 23) ''Mexican'' - Roided-up dumbass who was supposedly coked-up for all of season 3. [[SNCA|Nobody really cares about this asshole]], except he took a pair of tits off the market. Speaking of...

'''Sammi [[BAW|"Sweetheart"]] Giancola''' (Age 22) ''[[Self-Hate|Hazlet, New Jersey]]'' - One is actually from New Jersey, and is propagating this faggotry? [[Facepalm|Yes.]] [[Bullshit|"The sweetest bitch you'll ever meet"]] is what she claimed herself to be. What we got was yet another [[Woman|droning, annoying whore who can't spell her own last name without it being tattoo'd on someone]]. She's one of the few cast members to have gone to a REAL college, but she spent it playing [[Soccer]], so she's just like the rest of these sad, orange bastards. She, much like the man she fell in TV-Love with, Ronnie, has nothing else that really separates her from the rest of the cast except she fights with Snooki a lot about who's the bigger slut (the correct answer being, [[LOL|"Who ''isn't''?!"]]).she is a cunt now

'''Vinny [[Faggot|"Vincenzo"]] Guadagnino''' (Age 21) - ''[[Guido|Staten Island, New York]]'' - Mama's Boy, [[Sweat|Pit-Stains]] Himself, Definer of Fist-Pumping, All-Around Douchebag. He's an [[Waiter|"actor"]] who graduated from a community college and "plans to attend law school if acting doesn't work out." Yeah, [[Lulz|we'll see when that happens]]. Anyway, he's one of the other more vocal members and, quite oddly, the [[SFB|voice of reason]] when it comes to most of the house drama and hanging out at [[Nightclub|nightclubs]], meaning that unless he's angry, the lulz is likely to stop when he's in the scene. He's also one of the few leather-faced morons that can pass for human, mostly due to his not injecting steroids [[In the ass|into his ass]] every other day to get his sweet bod; for your [[basement-dwellers]], that's basically saying he left the house, went to a gym, and didn't devour pounds of Top Ramen and Cheetos all day while playing [[WoW]] and fapping to [[Mai waifu|an animu girlfriend from Lucky Star]].

'''Deena Nicole Cortese''' (Age 23) - ''New Egypt, NJ'' - Angelina's Season Three replacement, because nobody likes Angelina or wants her around.  Since Season Three is currently filming, nothing is known about her besides her [http://gawker.com/5599004/meet-deena-nicole-jersey-shores-new-guidette MySpace profile], which has been taken down due to her being on the show, or something. Actually Italian.

''[[Duckroll|'Duckphone]]'''  (Age Unknown) - ''[[Duckface|Staten Island, New York]]'' - The least-retarded cast member, and a minor IRL meme of the show that causes all of the call-drama within the house whenever the cast isn't using their cellphones. Once, helped convince a dumbass [[guido]] that Angelina was dead along with Snooki's help, and another time, helped break up Jwoww's relationship with her man-child of an ex-boyfriend. May secretly be recording all of the house's conversations to later blackmail them all later when The Situation and Pauly D get their own spin-off shows.

====Lyrics====
<pre>
This is DJ Pauly D 
Being a guido is a way of life 
I don't represent all Italians, I represent myself 
I started this whole GTL shit: Gym, Tan, and Laundry 
You gotta stay fresh to death

Yo, how come every time I'm DJ'ing, there be a hot ass girl but she got an ugly ass friend 
C'mon man, I ain't got no time for that 
I'm only dealing with nines and tens, not threes and fours 
So if your trying to get into my DJ booth, and your trying to come home with me DJ Pauly D 
Then you and your friends better come correct 
There will be no grenades tonight 

Where all my ladies at, make some noise! 
Where my fellas at, I can't forget my dawgs make some noise! 
When I'm in your city and your rockin' with DJ Pauly D 
And that beat hits you, you gotta fight back 
So what I need you to do is get down real low and tap that ground 
Keep hitting it! (x2) 
Now work your way up and fight that beat. Fight that beat! 
Now pump your fists!

* <b>Angelina Gets [[B&]] From Twitter:</b> After quitting the house (AGAIN) two weeks before Season Two ends and [http://www.bigmoeproductions.com/news/2010/08/29/angelina-speaks-out-on-ex-jersey-shore-cast-mates-on-twitter/ popping shit] on her official [[twatter]] account, [[MTV]] makes Angelina [http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/09/angelina_tweet-personator_may.html take it down and pretends that it was a fake Angelina].

* <b>Snooki Gets A Book Deal:</b> [http://gawker.com/5651434/americas-great-literary-hope-nicole-snooki-polizzi-to-publish-first-novel Simon & Schuster's Gallery Books imprint announced today that it will publish a novel by Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, the breakout star from the hit MTV reality show Jersey Shore]. Tentatively titled [[facepalm|A SHORE THING]], the novel will revolve around a [[whore|girl]] looking for dick on the boardwalk (one full of big hair, dark tans, and fights galore). A SHORE THING is currently scheduled for publication in January 2011.

* <b>Angelina Didn't Stay, Got Her Ass Beat: </b> Okay, [http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/10/exclusive-photos-boyfriend-jersey-shore-star-angelina-hospitalized-after-street it was more of Snooki's sloppy seconds], some dude named Jeff.  But it's still fucking hilarious. You stay with Angelina, you get your ass beat. You stay with Angelina, you get your ass beat. You stay with Angelina, you get your ass beat. You stay with Angelina, you get your ass beat.

* <b>The Situation Writes A [http://www.amazon.com/Heres-Situation-Creeping-Avoiding-Grenades/dp/1592406424/ Book]:</b> And it comes off more like a dude trying to hit on another dude. Check it:

[[File:The situation's book.jpg|thumb|[[not gay|Totes hetero]].]]

{{squote|At some point you're going to want to hit that dance floor, because there's no way you can stand the beat '''pumping through your body''' without surrendering to its gravitational pull.

Fist-pumping became a club necessity when the dance floor got so crowded from the bumping house music that '''the only place left to dance was up'''.  To execute the perfect fist-pump, follow these simple steps: Listen to the music, feel the beat, and '''[[my body is ready|let your body begin to respond unconsciously]]'''.  Go only with what feels right in that moment.  Don't worry about what looks polished. Who cares what some gorilla thinks while he's watching you vibe on the floor. '''Why is some dude looking at you, anyway?''' Close your eyes and start '''furiously [[masturbating|pumping]]''' your fist at the air.  That's right, not into the air, but <i>at</i> it.  You've got to beat back that beat.  Battle it, bro. You can't let it win.  The deep, thumping bass seizes hold of your every corpuscle. Let the beat strip away those last vestiges of self-conscious embarassment as you '''pound, pound, pound''' the air into rhythmic '''submission'''.  Battle harder. Keep battling, dawg. Never surrender.

Ah, but in the end, the beat always wins. As it always should.|The Situation's Ghost-writer}}

* <b>The Situation is [[Mel Gibson]]:</b> According to an exit interview with one of the many women The Situation did not have sex with during season two, one of his pickup lines is [http://www.bestweekever.tv/2010-10-27/exclusive-interview-jersey-shores-annabelle-desisto-reveals-the-situations-pick-up-line-can-you-just-shut-up-and-blow-me/ "Can you just shut up and blow me?"], as well as asking "Do you like getting your hair pulled? I need to know for later when I'm going to fuck you."  Later, she ended up at a Jay Leno taping, not aware that The Situation was a guest, and things got awkward.

* <b>[[Canada]] makes their version called Lake Shore:</b> Instead of [[guidos]] you have a [[Turk]]ish that hates the loud mouth [[romanian]] Jew, an [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|Italian that refers to himself as the #1 WOP]], a [[Tila Tequila]] wanna-be, a [[gay]] lebanese, a [[polish]] [[tranny]] better suited for the [[porn]] industry, and douchebag [[Eastern Europe|Czech]] and [[Albania]]n. Basically it's a show for eastern european [[attention whores]] to party. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-kpzWbv2Tc Youtube video here]

* <b> Angelina makes a godawful rap song: </b> Evidently, Angelina is not done whoring herself out yet. So she put out this rap song, called "[[No|I'm Hot]]." In it, some douchebag guy raps right along with her, talking about how hot she is and how misunderstood she is. Well, Angelina, we actually understand you perfectly. You're a self-absorbed, [[fat]], [[ugly]], [[whore|vapid cunt]] and you want the whole wide world to know it. Did I hit the nail on the head?

==TL;DR==
Fat, hideous sluts get drunk and punch bitches before rolling home to fuck their 'roided-out co-stars. In 2020 when the [[Chinese]] come to override [[lulz|American politics]], their fans are already prime candidates for [[people|Soylent Green]].

The fact that this article is so long proves [[Anonymous]] actually LOVES Joisey Sho', or some [[you|faggot on ED]] really wants to get into an anal-situation with Mike. Better start basting yourselves, 'cause there are a lot of chinks to feed.
