Canon
[[Image:Canon.jpg|thumb|250px|A typical Canon, weapon of choice for emos everywhere.]]

Whatever form it's told in (book, TV show, movie), a story will sometimes attract a body of [[batshit insane|pathological]] [[fan]]s who want to make it the center of their own identities and social lives. Given the fans have:
#reached a critical mass such that they are able to find each other 
#enough time on their hands and
#an inadequate grasp of how stupid their obsessions sound,
they will spawn endless [[tl;dr]] words. 
The new Internet-created environment for Condition 1 has broadened the scope of stories that fit this pattern.
If the story leads to subsequent spin-off stories (e.g. the story being told in a different (if perverted) form, and so on), the fans can enjoy endless [[masturbation|debates]] about how the authentic original story was truly and properly told '''IMH''' fuckin' '''O''' and what should be allowed in those terms.

Fanatical fans of this kind often have intellectual pretensions; ergo, they adopted the [[religion|ecclesiastical]] term '''canon''' to refer to "the exact way the only truly authentic and original version was really told". All facts in the canonical version are enforced as the absolute truth from which loyalty must [[nevar]] waver. There are times, however, when only a [[retard]] would say that canonical is better than non-canonical. For example, compare [[Sonic|Robotnik]] (only a complete faggot would call him [[Fail|"Eggman"]]) to his [[Pingas|Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]] counterpart. Whereas canon Robotnik has been getting [[Pwned|owned]] by [[DBZ]] villian [[Plagiarism|knock-offs]] lately, non-canon Robotnik was always awesome.

===Roots===
The original Christian Bible consisted of an account of the life of [[Raptor Jesus]], the Letters of [[Afroduck]], and one or two others, totaling twelve or thirteen books. At some stage between this and the inclusion of a bunch of bad [[meme]]s like the [[Apocalypse]] of [[Some Guy]] and the [[Moses|Old Testament]], the whole thing came to be called a "canon". [[Moar]] recently, other sects have included their own wild [[fanfic]] in "canonical" collections, notable examples including the [[Rapture|Left Behind]] texts (for the [[Republican|Church of the New Moral Superiority]]), the Book of [[Mormon|Mormon Magic]] (for the Mormons), and the Story of Jacub the 
Brilliant but Fucked-up Ancient African Scientist Who Created the [[Devil]] [[White People|White Man]] (for [[Malcolm X|the Nation of Islam]]). Being canonical is [[serious business]], so members of sects with competing [[crap|canons]] often settle their differences by starting a [[flame war]]. When this happens on the [[Internets]], it nearly always instigates [[internet drama]].

===Fanon===
People in [[Fandom|fandom]] also have [[flame war]]s concerning the terms "canonical" and "non-canonical". They always base their arguments on which [[fanfic]] holds their loyalty. This is because the people involved are always [[Retarded|fucking retards]].

==Alternate Sources of Canonical Info==

Aside from the original work (even if it's a spin-off on a bubblegum wrapper), some fans will consider certain interviews with the [[God|Creator]] to be legitimately canonical. The [[fantards]] most guilty of this crime are the rabid, disillusioned [[Ship|shippers]]. 

Take, for example, Harry/Hermione. Seriously, did you even read the fucking books? It's clear from the start that she was going to end up fucking Ron. 

==Examples of what is Canonical==
*Ubuntu
*Any event in an episode of ''The Simpsons'' or part of a ''Simpsons'' movie is part of the ''Simpsons'' canon (despite lack of internal consistency); events in ''Simpsons'' comics are completely non-canonical, though.

*In ''Lord of the Rings'', Frodo and Sam being [[gay]] for each other is canon to the movie fans, but their Vegas marriage is only canon to the [[slashfic]] crew. Flame wars between the few who'd actually read the books and movie fans were also particularly [[hawt]].

*Most anything from [[Soap_opera|soap operas]].

*Whatever [[Your Mom]] tells you.

*[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_INDEX.HTM The Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church]

==Examples of what is not Canonical==
*Anything on [[deviantART]]
*[[GoddessMillenia|Kain is gay for Raziel]]
*[[Fanfiction]]
*Your [[BFF]]'s [[thoughts on yaoi]]
*[[EverQuest#Drama|Iksars raping Dark Elves]]
