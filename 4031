'''InkLink''' is a shockwave game that, in the spirit of [[Web 2.0]], allows internet strangers to play a huge ripoff of Pictionary. Rather than having lulz at peoples' bad drawings, most [[luser]]s are there for point whoring and spell out the word for their "friends". InkLink's one redeeming quality, however, is that the people playing it are some of the most guillable and trollable internets users out there.

Before playing, remember to [[New User Registration|register]] an account with shockwave as guests cannot boot :(.

==Types of InkLink players==

There are four types of InkLink players: Trolls, Hardcore InkLink players, stupid kids, and [[pedophiles]].

===[[Trolls]]===
The few people who realize how stupid and boring the game is. They take it out on the [[retard|hardcore InkLink players]].

===[[retard|Hardcore InkLink players]]===

These people are well known [[basement dwellers]].  They are [[virgins]] but they'll give it up easy.

===Stupid kids===
Their only purpose in the rooms on InkLink is to be prey to pedophiles. It's part of the "InkLink food chain".

===[[Pedophiles]]===
Old men and fat chicks who go on InkLink to cyber with young boys and girls. They love [[buttsex]] and they easily succeed in meeting and raping the stupid kids who play this game.

==How to troll==
<!-------Please gallerize this image once we get more, if I gallerize it now it looks bad because it's the only one in the row--------->[[Image:Why Boot.JPG|thumb|OMG why r u guyz booting me?!?!?]]
InkLink is very fun and easy to troll. Here are a few ways you can have fun:

* Call people gay and other such immature comments.

* When it's your turn to draw, draw a dong, or perhaps a pair of tits. Or [[dickgirl|both!]]

*Pretend to cyber with a guy and then come out with "HAHA i'm a guy!". This brings many [[lulz]] as you laugh at the embarrassment of the [[fag]].

*Get someone's AIM, Myspace or whatever in a whisper and then announce it to the room

*Boot the nicest people, or anyone with at least two boots.  Then shout "Boot him!  Boot him!"

*Insult the fine works of [[shit|art]] drawn by others.

*Spam [[desu]]
