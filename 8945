[[Image:Ed-011809-screenshot.png|thumb|A typical web site.]]

A '''web site''' is a location in the [[internet]] that contains either [[lulz]] or [[Lie|shit nobody cares about]].  {{SITENAME}} has oodles of information on the most popular web sites.  For a list of them, please see [[:Category:Sites|the "Sites" category]].  

There are many different kinds of websites. Some are dedicated almost entirely to forums (i.e. [[4chan]]). Others [[fail|strive]] to the collection and organization of info from an unspecified or specified topic.  Many news agencies also maintain websites in order to rapidly disseminate lies to their mass of mindless followers.
