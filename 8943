After [[Al Gore]] invented the [[internet]]s, years of evolution revealed what the public wanted from the explosive and powerful new media:
* [[Porn]]
* A way to auction collectible dolls, beads, and holy cheese [[sandwich]]es to an international market (See:  [[eBay]])
* A cesspool of "[[totse|intellectual debate]]"
* [[Spyware]]
* A vehicle for inflicting insipid personal musings, boring [[dream]] recounts, bad [[poetry]], and hare-brained [[opinion]]s on more than family and coworkers.
* [[Blogtv]], camwhore central.

American industry immediately addressed the first four needs but it was not until the advent of the blog that the fifth was fulfilled. A '''weblog''' is a website maintained by an [[asshole|individual]], [[clique]] or organization for the purpose of posting [[article]]s about a specific subject. Weblog entries are presented in reverse chronological order and in CinemaScope with Dolby 5.1 sound (See: [[retard|Ass Backwards]] and in [[Moonspeak]]). 

The first blog was created by television geek Doogie Howser MD in 1989. Unfortunately the vomit-inducing corny sentences that Doogie typed into his blog caused mass induced Repressed Memory Syndrome across the world. This forced everyone to forget the original Doogie weblog and prevented the widespread use of blogs for more than a decade.

Many weblogs allow visitors to leave public [[comments]], which can lead to a community of typically [[fat|large]], [[gay|flamboyant]] readers centered around the blog, while others [[lurk moar]]. The totality of weblogs or blog-related websites is usually dubbed the [[blogosphere]], making it easy to roll off a cliff as opposed to a [[time cube|blogocube]] .

Blogs are known to be the things which have deposed the once great [[internets]] by giving every idiot a megaphone and should be considered the enemy of all with a true heart.

The most interviewed blogger (and biggest loser) record is held by that fatass who runs [[Fluxblog]].

==Types of Blog==
* '''Vlog''' - (video + weblog) a weblog consisting of videos of a fat idiot responding to some faggot (see [[YouTube]]).
* '''Moblog''' - (mobile + weblog) a weblog updated from a mobile device.
* '''Photoblog''' - (photograph + weblog) a weblog primarily consisting of photographs (see [[Jameth]] and [[camwhore]]).
* '''Imageblog''' - (image + weblog) a weblog showing images, especially ones the author found somewhere on the internet (see [[Spaceghetto]]).

== Popular Blog Topics ==

[[Image:Izzi Sileas Hacked Blog.jpg|thumb|right|Every [[liberal|blogger]] understands the risk of being [[hack|hacked]].]]

"Blogs," as weblogs are more commonly known, come in variety of [[ghey|flavors]].

* '''[[Politics]]''' 
** Author Profile: Intense, angry, probably a [[virgin]]
** Typical Talking Point: The [[government]] sucks!!!
** Representative Public Reply: [[OMG]]!!! Noes u [[suck]]!

* '''[[Celebrity]]'''
** Author Profile: Fat, horny, obsessed
** Typical Talking Point: I want to [[suck]] Brad!!!
** Representative Public Reply: [[OMG]]!!! He's [[gay]]!

* '''Literature and The Arts'''
** Author Profile: Neurotic, irritated by spelling errors, married to [[sock puppet]]
** Typical Talking Point: How low has sunk our once lofty level of discourse.
** Representative Public Reply: [[OMG]]!!! You're [[gay]]!

* '''[[Philosophy]] and [[Theology]]'''
** Author Profile: Loud, dogmatic, product of incestuous parents
** Typical Talking Point: Does a spiritual hammer of righteousness always trump a cosmic shield of purity or does that only apply to dwarves?
** Representative Public Reply: [[OMG]]!!! You're too [[lame]] to be [[gay]]!

* '''[[Journal]] i.e. Blather Log'''

** Note that journalists like [[LJ user]]s sometimes react [[cutting|violently]] when others accuse them of keeping a diary. Blogs [[clearly]] are nowhere near as interesting as someone's diary, consisting of 50 [[meme]]s and pictures of the author costumed in full [[furry]] regalia.

== The Proper Way To Vlog ==

*<big>'''Don't'''</big>. But if you must:

* Remember to never rehearse for your [[cam whore|vlog]]. After all, this is the [[gay|real]] [[you]] that they want to see, not some rehearsed, well-delivered speech.
* Don't make direct eye contact with the camera for more than 1 second unless you are very [[gay|angry]]. This gives the impression that you are "staring down" the audience and that makes them [[horny|nervous]].
* Don't sit still. Show them your excitement by nervously fidgeting throughout the entire video.
* Let's face it, no sane human being would look for random vlogs willingly, so be sure to load up the video description with as many keywords as possible. Example: "[[gay|vlog]], [[emo|sad, depressed]] [[wapanese|school girl]] ''[[fgt|Naruto]]'' [[incest]] blink-182 green<s>g</s>day [[horny|Harry]] [[buttsecks]] Draco..." etc. etc.
* When you are talking, end every sentence with an upward inflection in your tone, as if everything is a question?
* If someone makes fun of you on YouTube, respond with a raging tantrum expressing all of your heartfelt disgust, anger, and resentment at this person. Just completely let loose, scream and use profanity, threaten to kill them, anything.
* When people start [[lulz|laughing]] at that angry vlog, immediately take it down and replace it with a new version where you are calm and you pretend not to be bothered by the people who make fun of you.
* Remember to gear your material toward the crowd that would be most attracted to [[you]]. If you are a [[16 year old girl|somewhat attractive female]], try [[cam whore|doing sexy things on camera]] and you will attract desperate, horny guys, most of them [[pedophiles|registered sex offenders]]. If you are a [[fat]] chick, pretend you are a [[lesbian]] and you will soon have the entire community at your side. If you are a socially inept [[16 year old girl]] with small breasts and pale skin, go for the furry or NeoPets community.
* [[Lie]], [[lie]], [[lie]]! Let's get real here, you're [[fucking]] [[boring]]. [[You]] have to fabricate stories of terrible things happening to you and how you will "be strong" and "never give up". Tell them you have cancer, pretend to be crippled, tell them you have a [[gay]], [[retarded]], [[Jewish]] [[step dad|stepbrother]] named [[Disney|Mickey]] who has been disowned by his father and you're the only one who is there for him. Be [[gay|creative]].
* If the people that made fun of you just become too much for you to handle, move to LiveVideo, but not after making your last vlog that tells everyone you are leaving because of LiveVideo's features and whatnot.
* If all of the above fail to make an entertaining vlog, take a loaded shotgun, put it in your mouth, and become [[An Hero]] on your vlog. That always kills. In fact, just do this one first.
