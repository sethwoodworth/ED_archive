[[Image:Furrieseatingyourbrains.jpg|thumb|[[Truth|The truth]] about Draconic, as well as the truth about pretty much every other [[otherkin]] site out there.]]

Draconic is a website featuring [[FYIAD|real dragons]] [[Buttsex|learning magic]] from each other. Contrary to [[Some argue|popular belief]], Draconic was not invented [[over 9,000]] years ago by gigantic dragons from outer space but [[at least 100]] years ago by [[Dubya]] and his [[Furries|mindless slaves]] to [[Scientology|spread their word of horror across the world]]. It didn't take very long until it turned into a strange version of the [[Internet Hate Machine]] and started converting [[Basement dweller|innocent people]] into a [[Otherkin|braindead scourge]].

The founders of Draconic, being very [[butthurt|cunning]] and [[Retards|intelligent]], deny access to their forums to non-members, obviously in an [[fail|attempt]] to avoid [[lulz|unwanted attention]]. Too bad they don't realize nobody gives a shit about dragon.

== It spreads all over the Internet ==
[[Image:Lulwutfail.JPG|left|thumb|This is one of Draconic's main admins describing [[Plushophile|doing what she does best]]. [[http://www.furaffinity.net/view/1774996/#cid:13377883 Proof]]]]

[[Fat|Growing beyond the boundaries]] of Draconic like bacteria, it gets a bit stuffy and crowded. Hence, Draconic members are also to be found on [[LiveJournal]], where they are in charge of generating [[drama]], as well as [[deviantART]] and [[FurAffinity|FagAffinity]], where they share their [[Shit nobody cares about|interesting stories about life]] and [[Yiff|showcase]] [[Assburgers|artistic skills]] among [[Retard|equals]].

== Random facts ==
*[[Some argue|According to rumors]] there are [[mundane]]s on the Draconic, but that is likely just an attempt at propaganda to lure in [[Basement dweller|innocents]].
*Most Draconic users are [[Retard|l33t hax0rz]] and will d3str0y ur c0mp00ter if u mess around w/ th3m!
*teh vast majorty of ppl onm Dracnoinc [[Retard|cant]] [[Spelling|spel]].
*[[Party Van|Everyone can join!]]
*Confrontation with [[Truth|the truth]] causes them to [[Drama|bitch]] and [[Emo|cut themselves]].
*You have to be [[Gullible|open minded]] to be a member - [[Banhammer|or else]].
