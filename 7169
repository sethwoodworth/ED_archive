STD
{{needsmore|horrific pictures of STDs as well as more words}}

STD is the outdated term for venereal disease (so called because you get it through your [[in the ass|venerium]]). It stands for 'sexually transmitted diseases'. You can get these by kissing, holding hands, [[buttsecks|doin' the anal mambo]], sharing drinks or looking too closely at those of the opposite gender.  Most people contract STDs from your mom.

== Kinds of STDs ==

* '''Genital warts''' -  Small, painful itchy bumps on your [[cock]], [[cunt]] or [[anus]]. It cannot be cured; look forward to a lonely, titless/dickless life, because no one is going to want to [[fuck]] you now.
* '''[[Genital Herpes]]''' - Pretty much the same deal.
* '''Gonorrhea''' - Produces pus spewing from the end of your cock. 
* '''Syphilis''' - First causes a rash all over your body, then makes you go crazy and [[W|invade other countries]].

* '''Crabs''' - Lice that live in your pubic hair. (See [[Lovebugz]].)
* '''[[AIDS]]''' - Damn, dude. I'd start looking around Caskets-R-Us pretty soon. Prevalent in hotel pools, often closing them down completely until management sends out banhammers.
* '''Chlamydia''' - Usually doesn't cause symptoms, so that you don't even know you have it until you get an ectopic pregnancy about 15 years later, have to have an [[abortion]] to save your life, get kicked out of the [[Catholic]] [[Church]] and burn in [[hell]] for eternity. 
* '''Furpes''' - "Furpes" is a virulent genital ulcerative [[disease]], and one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in [[furries]]. The disease is spread by [[fuck]]ing someone who is wearing a [[Fursuit|stupid costume]]. Think carefully before you indulge; your actions could lead to large, unsightly pustules and sores all over your [[knob]].
* '''[[Diabeetus]]''' - An extremely fatal infection contracted by participating in [[sex|group anal sex]] with [[diabeetus|Wilford Brimley.]]
* '''Party popper cock worms''' - multicoloured nematodes that live under the foreskin. When they have finished growing and breeding, the whole colony explodes with a bang and a faint smell of gunpowder, their light ribbon-like bodies catching the breeze and wafting away. Unfortunately, this can blow the top of your cock right off. Easily cured anytime before the final stage by pounding a kilo of rock salt down your urethra.

Remember that next time he says he "can't feel anything through the condom."

== Cures ==
The only effective cure for all STDs is [[suicide]] and [[babyfuck|raping a virgin]] (no shit they still do it in parts of Africa, and since the only virgins left are infant girls ... you get the picture. This really is happening.). It's for the best, really. Unless a [[necrophilia]]c comes around. That [[sick fuck]] will have to kill himself, and start the cycle all over again. You can try penicillin, but it doesn't work and are a lie spread by the Jew media.

Sadly, those kids were lying. There's no cure.
