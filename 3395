Golden Road.net
'''[http://www.golden-road.net Golden Road.net]''' is a place where [[Aspergers|asspies]] gather on a regular basis to discuss an [[over 9,000|extremely old]] game show called <i>The Price Is Right</i>.

The users are deathly afraid of change and have somehow adopted the delusion that the show should remain exactly the same no matter what. The site is run by a pair of [[emo]] [[basement dweller]]s named Marc Green and John "ClockGameJohn" Sly. They get [[butthurt]] very easily, and, as you'll see in the section on Roger Dobkowitz's firing, that tends to [[banhammer|hurt]] [[troll|innocent users]] [[MOAR]] often than not. There was also a third owner named Robert Searcy, but he got [[pwned]] [[in the ass]] and hasn't been seen since.

==The site==

*'''Split Decision''': A forum where you can send Roger Dobkowitz your well-wishes. Assuming, of course, you have any.
*'''[http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?board=2.0 The Front Office]''': This is where the [[serious business|SRS BSNS]] gets posted.
*'''[http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?board=4.0 The Talk Is Right]''': The general discussion forum. Here, you can:
**[[Wank]]
**[[Flame]] anyone who proposes a change to the show
**Worship [[God|Bob Barker]] and bash Drew Carey
**[[waaaambulance|Whine]] any time a change is made to the actual show.
**[[Masturbate]] to pictures of [[slut|Janice Pennington, Dian Parkinson, and Holly Hallstrom]]
**And so much MOAR!
*There's also a forum called "[http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?board=15.0 Out in Left Field]", where you can do the same thing for other game shows, but [[noone]] gives a crap about them.
*'''[http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?board=5.0 Price Around the World]''': There are international versions of the show!?! LOL!!! I never knew that...!
*'''[http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?board=18.0 Ticket Requests]''': Scalp tickets from your fellow <i>Price</i> fans.
*'''[http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?board=6.0 Joe Capitano's Summaries and Spoilers]''': Some dipshit actually devotes his life to summarizing <i>Price Is Right</i> episodes. OMG SRS BSNS!!! There's also a section titled "[http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?board=7.0 Retro Recaps]" for episodes made prior to the existence of the site. Like anyone gives a shit.
*'''[http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?board=9.0 Pricing Game Reviews]''': As if things on the site couldn't get any more [[fucktard]]ed, they actually allow you to write reviews of the [[over 9,000]] pricing games on the show! Some paranoid dipshit named Alfonzo made the Retired Game Review section members-only. [[LOL WUT]]! But, as of August 9, 2008, the seal on the forum has been broken, and now [[Anonymous]] can read reviews of the retired pricing games. [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?board=10.0] [[shit no one cares about|Yay.]]
*<s>Host Your Own!</s> <big><b>BALEETED!!!</b></big>: {{quote|Think you have what it takes to be the next Bob Barker or Drew Carey? Join your fellow members in participating in mock TPIR episodes!|Golden Road.net}}
*No. These members [[fail]] at that because Bob Barker is [[Allah|God]], and Drew Carey is just a [[fat]] bozo with no life. On an interesting side note, 20% of your posts have to be in other sections of the site in order for you to play. Honestly, who gives a fucking shit?
*<s>[[CSS]]</s> <big><b>BALEETED!!!</b></big>: Not "cascading stylesheet", but "Chatroom Showcase Showoff". Basically, during the final round of the show (AKA the Showcase), the users go into the site's chatroom and bid on the Showcases on the real show. The [[winrar]] gets...absolutely nothing. [[WTF]]!?!
*<s>FPG</s> <big><b>BALEETED!!!</b></big>: "Friday Prediction Game". The users take the pricing game lineups for the Monday-Thursday episodes and use them to predict Friday's lineup. [[unfunny|Admittedly quite fun.]]
*<s>'''[[shit no one cares about|Other games]]''':
**The Amazing Race: Shitty spinoff of another [[old media|CBS]] show.
**GRECO!: A shitty ripoff of a shitty game called bingo.</s>
*<big><b>ALL BALEETED!!!</b></big>
*'''Golden Gallery''': A picture gallery full of [[crap]]. Used to be publicly viewable, but in 2005, Marc Green got fucking [[paranoid]] and made it members-only. [[Epic fail]]. It is currently unknown whether this area of the site has been BALEETED or not.

==Memes==
Because <i>The Price Is Right</i> has been on for [[over 9,000]] years, and because Golden Road.net has been online for [[at least 100]], a number of memes, both from the show and from the site, have formed.

Keep in mind, however, that Golden Road.net can't hold a candle to [[4Chan]], the reigning king of memes.
===From the show===
*'''The Epic Battle of [[fat|Drew Carey]] vs. [[old|Bob Barker]]''': The members of the site love to get in retarded flame wars over which host is better, with Bob Barker winning the battle by [[over 9,000]] points. They think that Bob Barker is the ONLY one who can do TPIR, and that [[noone]] else can. Defenders of Drew Carey say that the show now has a fresh feel to it, and that the show is enjoyable for the first time in many years. This constant [[bitch]]ing is a source of epic [[lulz]].
*'''[[pro-ana|Barker's Beauties]]''': Many <i>Price</i> fantards think that three sluts named Janice Pennington, Dian [[because of Parkinson's|Parkinson]], and Holly Hallstrom are the only three models that should be on TPIR, and that no one else can do the job. Never mind the fact that Bob [[rape]]d them, then fired them when they called him on it. Never mind the fact that they are bloody old and wrinkly and are as ugly as [[Madonna]]. Never mind the fact that the new models are younger and are put in a rotation to keep things fresh. They gots [[Asperger Syndrome]], [[Nevar forget|remembar]]!?! They want things to stay the same FOREVAR!!!
*'''[[slut|Yolanda Bowlsley]]''': [[At least 100 years ago|In 1977]], some contestant wearing a tube top flashed her [[boobs]] to the crowd, resulting in epic [[lulz]]. Bob Barker was initially confused about the whole situation, wondering why the audience was so [[orgasm|overly excited]] [[unwarranted self-importance|to see him enter]]. Johnny Olson, the announcer at the time, said, "Bob, they have given their all for you!" Later on, Bob remarked that "she came on down, and they [[tits or GTFO|came on out]]!" Yolanda to this day claims it was a wardrobe malfuncion. [[lies|LIES.]] Not to be outdone, in the early days of Drew Carey's run on the show, a couple other [[black]] women bared their [[ass]]es on the show. [[LOL]].
*'''Samoans''': In the early days of the show, fat [[AZN|Samoan]] women with little to no impulse control would glomp Bob Barker and lift him really high in the air. He fears Samoans to this day!
<youtube>o1wUQ7HApvA</youtube>
<youtube>IbjPNevN_Eo</youtube>
*'''[[over 9,000|$9,000]] Surfboards''': On TPIR's 25th Anniversary Special, a clip was shown of a really [[old]] lady bid $9,000 on a pair of surfboards.  The incident happened years before. Not to be outdone, in the spring of 2008, a really stupid contestant bid such shit as $2,000,000 on a prize. [[YouTube]] vids PLZ or it didn't happen.

===From within the site===
*'''Exacta/Wipeout''': An Exacta is what happens when a contestant plays a game perfectly. But since most <i>Price Is Right</i> contestants are clueless morons, this rarely happens, and those few that do score an Exacta usually are left completely confused, wondering how they got it. A Wipeout is what happens when a contestant loses the game very badly.
*'''Semi-Memorials''': A Showcase where both contestants are male is dubbed a "Robair Mackey Semi-Memorial Stag Showcase" by Joe Capitano. A Showcase Showdown where all three contestants are male is dubbed a "Betty White "Just Men!" Semi-Memorial SCSD". Unofficially, there is also a "HeelsRule1988 Semi-Memorial" for all-female Showcases.
*'''Can't Stop The Dob!''': Roger Dobkowitz likes to rig the show so that contestants lose. "Can't Stop The Dob" is secret code-speak. If the contestant wins the rigged game, then they successfully "Stopped The Dob". No longer relevant now that [[Golden Road.net#Roger Dobkowitz Gets Fired|Roger is fired]]; however, now that Kathy "Fingers" Greco is in his place, the site is considering renaming this meme to "Can't Fool the Fingers!".
*'''Heels/Fields/Garf/Willy/WSD/etc.''': Terms for going over or under the actual price of a Showcase by certain increments. There are no hard and fast guidelines for these memes except for the WSD, which occurs when a contestant overbids on their Showcase by $250 or less. It's the inverse of "DSW", Double Showcase Win, which is what happens if the contestant [[fail|wins]] by bidding within $250 of the right price. [[TL;DR|Like anyone really cares.]]
*'''GRECO, DAMN IT!!!''': What people called out when they were playing GRECO!. Yawn, [[plz]].
*'''Searcy, you beeyotches!''': A term used to signify the coming of Robert Searcy. No longer relevant now that Searcy has been functionally b&.
*'''Bork''': The site's chatroom server is [[lag|very unstable]]. Sometimes, users get kicked for no apparent reason. This is called Borking. Not to be confused with [[Microsoft|the Borg]].
*'''[[fuck|Friggin']] Random...''': Refers to prizes given on the show that seem to come from out of nowhere. Like boats, trailers, and Chevy Corvettes in some Showcases. Almost as pointless as [[DevianTart]]'s "[[in the ass|Collective Rectum]]" catchprase.
*'''_____ of the Century''': The blank is filled in with one of the overbid/underbid terms (Heels, Willy, Garf) or Bork. This signifies that a user or contestant performed EXTREMELY poorly on something. It's essentially the Golden Road.net equivalent of "[[epic fail]]". A Bork of the Century happens when everyone gets kicked from the chatroom at the same time for no apparent reason.

==Notable users==
===Pre Golden-Road.net, over on Bravenet(before Hitler Green took over) and The "MSN Years"===
*''' Jeff "Dickhead" Parsons'''...claims to be a Radio DJ somewhere in New England, but you can blame him for getting the Asspie/FanboI TPIR fan movement going! He started a really shitty forum on bravenet back in the day, and shut it down, because he claimed people were trolling. I know for a fact, that Steve Gavazzi himself, posted several troll posts, and blamed Hdayejr for it. Hdayejr got a ban because of this. They ended up dumping the shitty Bravenet forum for a new one on MSN Groups. They did take Zach Horan with them.
*''' Zach "Mommy Fucker" Horan'''. A real poster boy of the "Assburger" disease. Banned both from GRN and Invision, simply because he is a bit retarded, like the rest of his fellow boardies. Used to do the same job as Capitano, until 2003 on the new GRN. He gave Marc and John a piece of his mind about the change of the guard, and got banned. He wrote many things about TPIR in "Third Person", or possibly, his mother, Bonnie, wrote it for him. Or, quite possibly, she wrote all that stuff, while he was masturbating to his own posts. Sayings like ZHIFOS, ZHMTHOP, ZHIAGDMF, and even the newest one, ZHIBFI (Zach Horan is Banned from Invision), were coined during these versions of GRN.  NU NU NU game show terms were coined by him also. AWOR(another week of reruns), Spoiler space(with 9000 carriage returns after those words) were used frequently by him. Check the old alt.tv.game-shows for information about Retard Horan.
===Golden Road becomes property of Marc Green in 2003 when he fired Jeff Parsons from his own site===
These users are strictly part of this version of the site

*'''heelsrule1988''': A [[Teruchan|pervert]]. In Joe Capitano's summaries, all he does is comment about the girls with big [[boobs]]. He needs some <i>Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball</i>, stat! </[[Sarcasm]]>(I bet his monitor and TV are a bit sticky, eh?)
*'''[[emo|Whinbaby]]''': LOL!!! His name is "Whinbaby"!?! He is just as perverted as Heels. He actually keeps records of how much money in cash and prizes each model has modeled. [[facepalm|Too much time on his hands]].
*'''GoldenBulldog''': A total jackass who's been known to attack people in the chatroom and make really evil pricing games in Host Your Own. His crowning glory was "PYLinko", a [[retarded|special]] version of Plinko that replaced the $0 spaces with spaces that would cause the player to [[anti-lulz|lose all their money]]. [[Lulz]].
*'''FieldsFan336''': A rabid Rich Fields [[fangirl]]. She actually wanted him to host <i>The Price Is Right</i> when Bob Barker retired. [[LOL|LO-fuckin'-L.]](even had the nerve to post the email of Rich Fields' wife(an unlisted one no less) on her fangirl page!)
*'''FPGWillyT''': Obviously, he was the host of the Friday Prediction Game. He's become a total douche bag since Roger Dobkowitz was fired, trying to defend his [[Aspergers|ass burgers]]. [[Nice try]].
*'''Frank15''': Was a total dipshit until Drew Carey took over. Prior to then, he was a total censor in Joe Capitano's summaries and spoilers. He would edit the posts of anyone who [[truth|criticized the contestants]], and would mercilessly flame any Bob Barker [[hater]]s. But after Drew Carey began hosting the show, he began to have a [[emo|change of heart]].
*'''ClockGameJohn''': Sometimes called "LoserGameSally" in a joke that [[unfunny|only two or three people get]]. He's [[Tim Buckley|a very arrogant administrator who thinks he's all that and a bag of chips]] because he played [[cock|Clock]] Game on the actual show back in 2003. He's really a dumb fuck. Like all [[moderator]]s, he sucks. Has definitely earned the nickname "Hitler John" for his excessive range blocks of ip numbers.
*'''MSTieScott''': Works on <i>The Price Is Right</i> as a page. [[an hero|Abandoned]] the site in November 2007.
*'''Steve Gavazzi''': Maintains an FAQ full of information that only the world's biggest [[Asperger|ass burger]] would know. Like the exact dates each <i>Price Is Right</i> game debuted, the tenures of all the models, and even a timeline of all 36 seasons. [[shit no one cares about|No one else cares.]] He has always been fairly rude to anyone on the website who supports even the tiniest bit of change, but he's became an even bigger [[shitting dick nipples|dipshit of an asshole]] thanks to Roger Dobkowitz's firing. Blames Fremantle Media so much, he probably thinks [[Jews did WTC|they did WTC!]]. He is extremely paranoid, especially on Wikipedia articles. All edits are reverted by him, on sight, and he claims they are from Hdayejr or John Chartier. BRAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!
*'''Nick''': The only user who can possibly claim to be a bigger fan of the show than Gavazzi. Since the beginning of Season 37, he has constantly written really long recap posts about how terrible the show currently is, and nitpicks on every single aspect of Drew's performances. He constantly talks about how Roger should be brought back, and thinks that everything about the show should be the way he wants it to be. Not surprisingly, 18 users have ignored him.
*'''rob79''': A user who does absolutely nothing but complain about the lineups in the recap threads. Um...ya do know that the Joe Plinkos who watch the show don't give a **** about what games are played? They concentrate on the bigger things, like Drew's hosting. Maybe you should, too.
*'''goldroadfanatic''': A user who always posts random dates of occurrances that no one else even knows or cares about. He's essentially a much worse version of Gavazzi and Nick in that regard, and uses archaic insults like, "That showcase wasn't only garbage, it complemented it!" but it fortunately not an arrogant jerk like either of them are.
*'''Joe Capitano''': A [[Nazi]] who writes summaries of each new <i>Price</i> episode. His summaries are confusing as hell. Beginning January 2008, he got paranoid and wrote a stupid-ass little disclaimer saying that "This is the only Golden Road.net show recap. Reproduction without author permission prohibited." [[sarcasm|Like anyone would really steal his horseshit.]]
*'''Marc Green''': Created the site in 1998. The majority of the site is essentially the product of him sucking Roger Dobkowitz's cock. Was originally thought to be one of the few sane fans on the site, but his true intentions have now been revealed. He's just another ordinary [[fantard|fanb01]].
*'''Robert Searcy''': Was the tech support guy until he was [[pwned|fired]]. Acted like a [[redneck]]. Always bragged about his home in Talking Rock, Georgia, and worshipped NASCAR driver Reed Sorenson like a fanb01. He was incredibly [[emo]] in chat and was fired after cracking under pressure. Although he has not been confirmed to be banned from the site, he has not been seen on Golden Road.net since.
*'''BRB_TheFireball''': black person  Real name is Bo Bielefeldt, or as many long time well respected online game show fans call him, "Beau Bellefoot." He's like HeelsRule1988, only [[Barack Obama|he only likes the black women]]. In Host Your Own, he always uses the black models to model prizes, and the announcer is always Burton Richardson. Nice to see the [[NAACP]] is well-represented. </Sarcasm>  From 1998 to 2000, he posted to alt.tv.game-shows, using so many aliases, including his own classmate, Scott Theis, to cheat at Netgames.  His cover was blown in 2000, and still has not owned up to his asshole-ish antics to this day. 
*'''Ccook''': Writes obituaries in "Out in Left Field" that, usually, [[noone]] really cares about. [[Jerry Falwell]] and [[Tim Russert]] being the obvious few exceptions.
*'''Robair Mackey''': Originally hosted CSS, but abandoned Golden Road.net due to...[[an hero|"personal reasons"]].
*'''Scorpz''': Did summaries before Joe Capitano took over, and also keeps a lot of [[shit no one cares about|obscure statistics]] like pricing game frequency [http://www.tpirsummaries.8m.com on his personal website].
*'''CBSpromoman''': Not a real promo man for See B.S.. One of the few sane voices on the site. He helped guide his fellow fanb01z through the [[butthurt|rocky times]] of the search for Bob Barker's replacement.
*'''DJSquare''': A [[France|French]] [[Canada|Canadian]] who maintains a site called [http://www.tpirmodels.com TPIRModels.com]. He's like HeelsRule1988 and [[emo|Whinbaby]] put together. The vast majority of his pictures are of <i>Price</i>'s models in swimsuits. [[Pedobear|Like we care.]]
*'''starcade, ILoveBonusGame, junkaholic95, and others''': The most radical of the radical fanb01z on the site. They are borderline [[Asperger|autistic]] and/or right-wing [[conservative]]. When ClockGameJohn or Marc Green announce a change to the site, they are usually the first to announce that they are no longer watching <i>Price</i>...only to watch the show three seconds later. Holy shit; they're just like many [[DevianTart]] users!
*'''[[Madonna]]''': [[epic fail|Uh, no.]] Despite her attempts to make you believe otherwise, this is NOT the incredibly slutty singer of such [[shit]] as <i>Like a [[Virgin]]</i>, <i>[[narcissism|Material Girl]]</i>, and <i>[[Goatse|Open Your Heart]]</i>. This is just a fangirl of Madonna. Her critiques of <i>Price</i> are filled with lots of [[emo]]tion. [[nice try|Like that's gonna save her from total epic failure.]]
*'''brtsimpson142''': Formerly known as WarioBarker, but he doesn't think anybody knows that. A total asspie. Frequently cites TV Tropes, which he is usually the sole editor of, as a final sign of authority.
*'''mrbrown2195, Axl, isucgv, imhomerjay, and urbanpreppie0004''': Some of the only sane members remaining on the website. They aren't as hardcore as most of the other members, and mrbrown owns Nick on an almost daily basis regarding his views on the show, but Nick's too stubborn to admit it.

==Famous events==
*'''The Price Is Right Live''': Not to be confused with a set of live shows done in [[Las Vegas]] by Todd Newton, ClockGameJohn did "live" shows in GRN's chatroom. However, there hasn't been a single live show done since 2006, and no one really knows why.
*'''Daniel Rosen [[troll]]s the site''': [http://www.golden-road.net/archive/index.php?topic=3212.0] In 2004, in the period after Rod Roddy died but before Rich Fields became announcer, a single user registered [[over 9,000]] accounts to support some stupid dipshit named Daniel Rosen. ClockGameJohn, however, found him out and pwned him on a topic called, "Welcome, Troll!"
*'''DuffnationUSA''': In early 2007, a user by this name proposed a bunch of changes to TPIR, such as [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=2396.0 models in bikinis] (something that, might we add, has actually happened now that Drew Carey is the host), [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=2380.0 bidding in secret in Contestants' Row], [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=2387.0 inviting the fired models], and [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=2374.0 showing Bob Barker's last episode live]. The fanb01z, being [[Aspergers|ass burgers]], fired back, flamed him, and got him permab&. [[Nevar forget]].
*MOAR threads: [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=2399.0] [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=2383.0] [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=2397.0] [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=2403.0] The last link contains spoilers, hence why DuffNation was b&. <b>[[censorship|ZOMG HEAVEN FORBID SOMEONE SPOIL THE OUTCOMES OF THEIR PRECIOUS GAMESHOW!!! D: D: D: D: D:]]</b>
*'''Bob Barker's retirement''': The entire Golden Road.net fan community went up in arms when Bob Barker decided to retire from <i>The Price Is Right</i> after hosting it for 35 years straight. Most of them thought that the show should have been cancelled, and those that wanted the show to go on wanted some robotic clone like Todd Newton or John O' Hurley to be the new host. And when Drew Carey was picked, it took them a while to believe it. Are they stubborn or what? xD
*'''Field of 64 Pricing Games''': Someone named sideshowPA pulled this idea out of his ass. Basically, he took 64 pricing games and played an NCAA-style elimination tournament with them. The [[winrar]] was not Golden Road, Plinko, or Cliff Hangers but "Hole in One".  The tournament lasted through <i>Price</i>'s 35th season.
*'''Chatroom drama''': Robert Searcy got paranoid of FPGWillyT abusing his moderator powers in the chatroom late in 2007, and starting going [[batshit crazy]]. He started urging people to boycott the site and the chatroom. Marc Green fired him, and possibly banned him. The irony is, FPGWillyT did nothing wrong. [[LOL WUT]]. [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=4661.0] [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=5097.0] Someone on [http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com BuzzerBlog] later recounted the event as Marc acting [http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/the-price-will-be-just-fine-so-dont-worry-about-it-pt-2/#comment-68959  "like a little baby here a few months ago because someone peed in his corn flakes, and he stepped down as the admin? What a cry baby."] [[QFT]].
*'''The meltdown''': [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=5787.0] Junkaholic95 got all pissy because someone DARED to criticize Bob Barker. The ensuing [[lulz]] caused Marc Green to disable editing of posts. After some protests, the ability to edit posts returned, but not before ClockGameJohn put a 10-minute limit on editing. And what did all that accomplish? [[fail|Nothing.]] By the way, the "anonymous member" is actually a user named WarioBarker. [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=5046.msg82017#msg82017 Nice try.]
*'''Terry Ownz the Showcase''': In December 2008, a contestant by the name of Terry totally owned the showcase by making a perfect bid. The entire Golden Road.net fan community went up in arms about Drew Carey's non-reaction. Fanbois claimed to cause Terry's win, but Terry said they were losers.

==Roger Dobkowitz Gets [[pwned|Fired]]==
On July 3, 2008, longtime producer Roger Dobkowitz got [[pwned]] by the suits at Fremantle Media for unknown reasons. But, given the fact that he is associated with Bob Barker, it may be because they want to get rid of Bob's legacy completely and make people associate the show with Drew Carey.

Seems like a perfectly good reason to fire someone, [[amirite]]? Out with the old; in with the new. [[France|C'est la vie.]] But the fanb01z, being [[Aspergers|autistic]], don't see it that way. Just as they thought Bob Barker should continue hosting until he died onstage, they think that Roger should continue until he dies in the director's box.

So, in an [[emo]] fit of [[butthurt]], Marc Green [[delete fucking everything|deleted fucking everything]] and made a thread called "The End of the Golden Road", which contained announcements that implied that he would be shutting the site down. The fanb01z responded accordingly, blaming Fremantle Media like [[Adolf Hitler]] blamed [[Jews]]. Some were already swearing off the show even though Season 36 (and therefore Roger's run) didn't end until July 17, 2008, and some even called for a boycott of <i>Price</i>. Loyal Friends and True...quitting watching the show they're loyal to!?! [[OMGWTFBBQ]]!?! Now that's [[hypocrisy]]. LOL!

The grand irony was, they were already saying that <i>Price</i> has [[jumped the shark]] when they didn't even know who Roger's successor will be! They were already scaring fellow TPIR fans with phantoms of video walls, LCD Contestants' Row podiums, and other stuff that <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> and <i>Jeopardy!</i> adopted [[at least 100 years ago|many years ago]]. Further proving that they all have [[Asperger Syndrome]].

They did this shit last year when Bob Barker left...and even the most hardcore fanb01z admit that Drew Carey does a much better job than they first thought. History's repeating itself. Everything old is new again. If Roger Dobkowitz's successor turns out to be like Drew Carey, or if nothing ends up changing when Season 37 begins, they'll likely end up committing [[suicide]] because they suck at life. [[ROFL]][[LMAO|MAO]]

==Golden Road.net recovers...uh, we think==
By July 17, 2008, Golden Road.net was finally back up. The "End of the Golden Road" forum was replaced with a forum called "[http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?board=26.0 Split Decision]". In that forum, there are two threads. [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=7669.0 The first one is for sending "The Dob" well-wishes that will later be shown to him.] But [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=7668.0 in the other forum], ClockGameJohn claims that he BALEETED the old forum to "preserve the integrity of the site". The grand irony is, he and Marc Green were the ones who encouraged users to destroy the integrity in the first place.

Do these guys know [[Jark]], by any chance? They sure are acting a lot like him...

Anyway, while the "End of the Golden Road" forum may have been deleted, the quotes have not. Because the truth can't be hidden, and the Internets nevar forget. See the "Notable Quotes" section below.

Also, some members of the site have actually seen the show in person and have confirmed that some changes have been made to the show. [http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=7906.0 This thread] contains lots of ongoing debate about Season 37.

[http://www.golden-road.net/index.php?topic=7961.0] But while taping for Season 37, it appears that someone made a mistake while playing Plinko. Also, there were quite a few...uh, problems...with the Showcase Showdown wheel. To [[Anonymous]], this is [[shit no one cares about]]...yet, once again, just like with Roger Dobkowitz's firing, the fanb01z are already raising bloody hell about a possible rigging scandal. And, once again, they're blaming Fremantle for everything. So they still haven't recovered from "The Dob"'s firing. Troll for the lulz PLZ.

==GRN finds out about this page==
Golden Road.net found out about this article. And their reactions to it only confirm to us that they are stupid [[fucktard]]s. They are accusing [[Anonymous]] of [[slander]] and are acting extremely [[butthurt]]. Like we haven't already seen that [[shit]] a million times with [[Snapesnogger]], [[DivineAngel]], and their own [[MDetector5]]? LOL. [[xD]]

All their accusations and emo whining seem to center around a user on that site named "Alex" who was banned in 2006. Alex just happens to go by the name [[user:A-l-e-x-99|A-l-e-x-99]] on this website, and he wrote the first version of this page, and stops by occasionally to do maintenance or add lulz. The grand irony is, they're accusing him of doing stuff that they do on a regular basis. They're also accusing him of really wild shit like harrassing users via private messaging, which he never did.

All he did in his short period of time on GRN was [[troll|lurk]] through the Golden Gallery, and make a few posts. In the thread titled "Card Game rules", he tried to post a poll, but the software the site ran on at the time was [[hacker|glitchy as hell]], and it kept eating his poll. He let his anger boil over on the site by posting "DAMN IT, WHERE'S MY ****ING POLL!?!" in red and with really big text, and he was [[banhammer]]ed in June 2006 for that.

ClockGameJohn SAID it was a 30-day ban. Yet, 90 days went by and he was never unbanned. Although he threatened to [[E-lawyer|sue]] the site, nothing really ever got off the ground.
