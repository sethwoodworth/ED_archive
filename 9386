^
__NOTOC__
'''^''' is a [[meme]] started by noted meme hater [[BLARGH_IS_NOW_A_MEME|Blargh]] ([[Hitler]] and [[God]] [[fanboi]] and ED's own [[Eric Cartman]]) to troll people in #ed [[IRC]]. The idea is that the '''^''' symbol points to the person who posted the last message, then the message next to the '''^''' is something insulting. For example,

{{quote3|
<Blargh> OMG DO I SUCK COCKS OR WHAT?<br>
<NeoLobster> ^ BUTTHURT FAGGOT
}}

LOL HOW CLEVER. [[User:NeoLobster|NeoLobster]] CALLED BLARGH A BUTTHURT FAGGOT!!![[oneoneone|ONEONEONE]]

== History ==
Blargh is always looking for ways to [[troll]] the people he hangs out with in [[IRC]] every day because he's a [[fucktard]]. As a result, he decided to steal the idea of pointing at people and throwing shit from black person, only applying it to [[IRC]].
{{quote|ill troll who i want|[[BLARGH_IS_NOW_A_MEME|Blargh]]|[[IRC]]}}

== Correct Usage ==
[[Image:Blarghmemecarat.jpg|thumb|A pictorial demonstration of the usage of ^.]]
Using the ^ symbol shows your distaste for the topic, mods, or life in general. However, there are some general rules that [[BLARGH_IS_NOW_A_MEME|Blargh]] follows:
# Only use ^ to piss off ops
# Only use ^ after being invited back into the channel after a ban
# Claim complete ownership over ^ and everything it stands for.
# When you get (re)banned, complain that you're going to tell [[Sheneequa]] because she's the only one who can stand [[you]].

{{quote3|
<Blargh> y u ban<br>
<Blargh> u sux<br>
<Blargh> i am reporting ur abuse<br>
}}

Blargh threatening a new op who quickly told him [[STFU]].


== Newfags Catch On Slowly ==
Once the newfags get past the "LOL WUT" phase of ^-mastery, they begin to fuck it up badly.

{{quote3|
<Blargh> <NeoLobster> ^ BUTTHURT FAGGOT<br>
<Triflin> ^ Wonderful human being with many redeeming qualities<br>
}}

Triflin obviously didn't mean to do that.

== [[BLARGH_IS_NOW_A_MEME|Blargh]] Sucks at it ==
{{quote3|
<NeoLobster> h64: WHERE DID YOU GO?<br>
<k-hate> literally<br>
<Blargh> ^ fat fatty fat lobster fat gay fatty with aids<br>
<k-hate> and was like IT DOESNT WORK<br>
<Homicide> okay now blargh got k-hate<br>
<Homicide> twice<br>
<NeoLobster> WHY DID YOU CALL K-HATE FAT FATTY FAT LOBSTER FAT GAY FATTY WITH AIDS TWICE?<br>
<Homicide> lol<br>
<Blargh> no i didnt<br>
<Blargh> you are lagging<br>
<Blargh> <NeoLobster> h64: WHERE DID YOU GO?<br>
<Blargh> <Blargh> ^ fat fatty fat lobster fat gay fatty with aids<br>
<Triflin> no nigger, you are lagging<br>
}}

[[BLARGH_IS_NOW_A_MEME|Blargh]] pretty much always fails at getting the ^ right. He will nevertheless post his version of the log where he claims he did it right, and he will claim that [[you]] are lagging. He took [[Computer_Science_III|CSIII]]. Believe him.

== Conclusion ==
^ is just another reason [[BLARGH_IS_NOW_A_MEME|Blargh]] (in his own mind) will never get aops in [[ED:IRC|ED IRC]]. Put that together with his religious banter, lack of contribution to ED, and the fact that he, himself is a [[meme]], and you'll soon realize that opping [[BLARGH_IS_NOW_A_MEME|Blargh]] should only be done if everyone is about to quit a channel.
