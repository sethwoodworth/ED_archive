Ever look at your [[Facebook]] friend list and wonder "'''who the fuck are all these people?'''" and how did they get there? It's at such times that a friend purge (aka '''unfriending''') is in order.

==Whom To Purge==
*Who the fuck are [[random|you]] and what are you doing on my friend list?
*Anyone who is friends with [[will.i.am]]. [[PROTIP]]: the friend of your enemy is '''not''' your friend.
*[[USI|Anyone]] with over 1000 friends (aka [[attention whore|professional friend collectors]]).
*Anyone with under 50 friends (aka [[losers]]).
*[[DO NOT WANT|Anyone]] who is [[ugly]].
*[[Blacks|Anyone]] not down with [[Michael Jackson]] jokes.
*Anyone who continually invites you to crap parties and events you never have and never will attend.
*Anyone you friended to suck up for a job.
*[[Porn star|Anyone]] you friended to get in his/her pants and [[failed it]].
*[[ODB|Anyone]] with [[herpes]]. You can catch STDs through your Facebook connections.
*Married couples. I don't need to friend both of you.
*[[NORPS]] who continually clog up your newsfeed with endless minutia about their [[awesome]] kids.
*[[Jews]]. There are already too many of them on Facebook. Don't encourage them.
*If you friended any celebrities or politicians just kill yourself right now.
===Deep Cleaning===

The above list will easily cut your overloaded friend list in half without having to dig too deep. If further purging is desired or required and you have some time on your hands, take a closer look at your so-called friends. Check out their favourite bands, books, movies and the pages and groups they belong to. You will doubtless be horrified to find that some of your friends like unforgivable crap and/or subscribe to [[tea party|ugly political causes]] or other [[faggotry|special interests]]. You can shed dozens of 'friends' for being complete douches including -but not limited to:

*Anyone who likes the [[Black Eyed Peas]].
*Anyone who likes [[Twilight]] and/or [[Harry Potter]].
*Anyone who likes [[Avatar]].
*Anyone who likes [[Glenn Beck]].
*Anyone who didn't want to go to [[Kate's Party]].
*Anyone who's [[Juggalo|down with the clown]].
*Anyone who frequents [[Know Your Meme|KYM]] or [[lolcats|other shitty sites]]

==[[PROTIP]]: Trolling Unfriends==

Before you unfriend any of the above perpetrators, post this article on their wall. And if the soon to be [[defriend]]ed oink is one of those annoying chronic [[DJ|party/event inviters]] who have finally crossed your personal line in the sand with their latest (and last) invite, click '''NO''' to the RSVP and leave a nasty message about their imminent demise as your 'friend' that will display on the event's page for the whole class to see.
