Admiral Ackbar
[[Image:Ackbar.jpg|frame|right|Our courageous hero.]]

'''Admiral Ackbar''' is a [[Sea Kittens|fish faced]] character demonstrating the un-fishist Equal Opportunities policy of the Rebel Alliance in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies and novels, which is not important anymoar because [[you|no one]] gives a [[shit]] about ''Star Wars''. Due in part to Admiral Ackbar's fuckatarded voice, [[vagina]]-esque face and over-acting, his famous line, "It's a trap!" achieved [[meme]] status.

== It's a backstory! ==

Admiral Ackbar is really only a [[meme]] when used in conjunction with his famous line in ''Star Wars, Episode VI: Luke Skywalker and the Sorceror's Stone''. It all started at [[ebaumsworld|OriginalContent.com]] with some [[newfag]] posting a picture of Admiral Ackbar, to which another person responded, "ITS A TRAP!!!" 

[[Image:rickready.jpg|frame|right|[[Rickroll|The actual trap]]]]

That [[Epic Thread|thread]] continued in that fashion; someone would post something that resembled the word "trap", be it tarp, carp, or snark. It stopped being funny after 10 posts, but the [[Btard|tards]] wouldn't stop. Whenever newfags encounter their first epic thread, they always cling to the [[So cash|forced meme]] as if it were [[THE BEST|the best]] thing evar. This would ensure Admiral Ackbar's place in internet history.

== It's a definition! ==

For reasons unknown, the phrase "It's a trap!" is normally used when someone posts a picture of a [[shemale]].  It's a trap! is used to warn others not to fap, as they will instantly be turned homosexual when the [[OP]] reveals s/he actually has a dick. Usually the OP will post a pic of a closeup of just their ass in panties, or a blowjob pic where their hair is covering most of their face and ask, "[[DO NOT WANT|Do you think I'm hot?]]"  Most of the responses will be "OH GOD YES MOAR" or "[[Tits or GTFO]]", but a select few will know the truth and warn others of the ruse the only way they know how, with a picture of an ancillary ''Star Wars'' muppet.
