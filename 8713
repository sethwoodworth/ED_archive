Usenet
'''Usenet''' is the [[OP|original]] Internets lulz and hate machine. It was created [[at least 100 years ago]] by [[basement dwellers]] and other [[furries]] as a means of sharing information about how much their parents were making them pay rent now that they were 30. Usenet messages are similar to [[e-mail]], except they are public, and anyone can view and participate in the [[drama]].

==Influence of Usenet==
Usenet is of significant cultural importance for the [[Internets]], having been the beta testing ground for important Internets features such as [[spam]], [[trolling]], [[Internet Law]], and the [[flame war]]. Usenet pioneered drama generation in the field of technology and [[some argue]] that it is in fact the grandfather of all [[lulz]] on the [[Internets]]. Many advanced linguistic communication techniques also originated or were popularized on Usenet, such as "[[NO U]]" and "I will [[hack]] your computer if you don't [[STFU]]."

[[eternal September|Usenet was vastly improved]] when AOL added access to its service package. The influx of [[newfags|millions of AOL members]] breathed new life into Usenet, and they [[lie|were welcomed with open arms]] by [[oldfags|old users]]. Today, Usenet features less [[lulz]] due to a move towards formats more accessible to your average [[16 year old girl]], such as [[Livejournal]] and [[MySpace]]. The major advantage it has over blogs, though, is that Usenet requires no personal registration with the group concerned. This facilitates drama generation by encouraging [[troll]]s, the easy creation of [[sock puppet]]s, and so forth. The ability to use any name and email address enables easy application of classic techniques such as [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]. 

Since [[at least 100|a modicum]] of [[skill]] is necessary to access Usenet, [[some argue|it can be argued]] that [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|the cancer]] killing other forums is the [[chemo]] that is saving Usenet.

== [[TL;DR|Technical Details]] ==
[[Image:Udenet.jpg|thumb|left|Before pics the internet had moar sex stories.]]
Articles posted to Usenet are organized into [[forum|topical categories]] called ''newsgroups'', which are themselves [[logic|logically]] organized into hierarchies of subjects. Everything [[you]] want is in the '''alt.*''' heirarchy, for instance, '''[[Church of the SubGenius|alt.binaries.slack]]''' and '''[[sick fuck|alt.sex.colostomy]]''' are within the alt.* hierarchy. [[shit nobody cares about|The other top level heirarchies]] are: '''comp.*''', '''misc.*''', '''news.*''', '''rec.*''', '''sci.*''', '''soc.*''', and '''talk.*'''.

At first, Usenet was only used to share erotic [[furry]] stories. Then, one day, after the [[tubes]] had [[Goatse|expanded]], someone figured out that if binary files were encoded as text, Usenet could be used to share not only furry stories, but pictures of [[scat|Japanese people eating each other's shit]]. Since then, Usenet has been an important port for valuable Internets exports such as [[virii]], [[child porn]], and [[bestiality]] videos.

The type of Usenet client one uses is crucial for a positive experience. The best client to use is of course the AOL newsgroup reader. Not only does it provide optimal quality and support all binary encoding types, but it will ensure that everyone else knows you are an AOL user, which will make Usenet regulars more likely to respect the opinions expressed in your posts. If your parents canceled your AOL account, the next best thing is to use Microsoft's Outlook Express. You should make sure to use MIME encoding when posting binary attachments to messages, because everyone likes mimes.

Usenet can also be accessed via the Web. Virtually all messages posted to Usenet are now archived and made available in publicly-searchable databases, such as [[Google]] groups. When Google announced that they would make publicly available an archive of Usenet text messages dating back [[at least 100 years]] it created much drama and lulz, all the racist remarks and sexual deviant confessions that had ever been posted were now easily available for all of the Internets to see. Many of these had been made when the Internets were obscure and only [[basement dwellers]] who [[pwned|paid for access by the minute]] knew about them, and contained the poster's [[PowerWord: IRL Name]], creating great lulz for them, their family, and coworkers. This archival service allows us to forever retain the [[spam|rich cultural heritage]] and [[Flame wars|historical records]] that had previously been passed on only through [[fellatio|oral tradition]], such as the generous [[419|Nigerian man]] who was always offering to give anyone half of his vast fortune if they would only help him transfer it into America by giving him all their bank account information.

==Social Structure of Usenet==

Proper Netiquette should be [[nevar|always]] be observed on Usenet. Some of the most important things to remember:

* Always type your posts in [[ALL CAPS]], as this facilitates easy reading for the average Usenet user, whose eyes are all squinty like a [[80 year old Chinese man in panties|Chinese person]] because of the poor lighting common in most basements. 

* When you do not see what you are looking for in a specific group, you should request it; suggested subject title format is "WHER R TEH FUCKIGN BRITTNEY SPEARZ N00DZ YOU FUCKING FAGOTS???/?//???/"

** The files you request do not need to relate to the subject of the group. For example, you MUST request bestiality porn in '''alt.rec.disney'''. 

** To increase your chances of your request being filled, you should include in your body text the following: "i dunt have teim to check back here again so plz just email me the files, TIA" (TIA here stand for [[Kthxbye|'''T'''hanks '''I'''n '''A'''dvance]]). Note that you MUST use your real email address for this to work, otherwise you will miss out on [[spam|valuable offers]].

* When you are ready to move on to posting porn of your own, you should include PAR2 recovery files to make up for any file corruption or missing posts that are common on Usenet. The most important thing to remember about making PAR2 files is to include not only the archived and split files in the recoverable data, but the original large [[swap.avi|.avi]] file as well. 

The [[Bureaucratic Fuck|kool kids]] on Usenet hang out in '''alt.config'''. This is a lot like [[b]] except there are no lulz and you can't get a [[Perma-ban]], not even for sending someone to [[last measure]]. Many of the people here are Usenet server administrators or like to Role Play being such, consequently they have never had any [[sex]], [[evar]] and are quick to anger. 

When posting to alt.config you should always remember that alt.config is [[serious business]]. alt.config is where you go to propose new ''alt.*'' groups, even though you do not need to propose anything there, ever; all you have to do is send out a new group command message. alt.config functions as a forum for inflating the [[e-penis]] of its regulars and rejecting all proposals for new news groups. If you fail to propose your new group in alt.config before sending out the make group message, all the [[basement dwellers]] who frequent it will get their panties in a bunch and send out remove group messages with the reason "not discussed on alt.config," which everyone will then ignore. 

For lulz, it is encouraged to send out remove group messages to remove alt.config with the reason "not discussed on alt.config," as alt.config was not discussed on alt.config before it was created. 

One of the biggest things alt.config regulars have a problem with is the naming conventions for groups. Thus, it is encouraged to create groups with entirely new hierarchies, particularly ones that are really sentences with periods instead of spaces, for example george.bush.is.a.faggot.and.i.hate.him.a.lot; this creates 11 different groups with one message, and [[moar]] is always better.

== Derailment of Efficiency ==
Just like [[IRC]], Usenet was fucked when the superior HTTP came along. Albeit at that time, web wasn't [[Web_2.0|what we see today]], people were happy that they've finally find a better way to publish their [[fanfictions]]. The number of people using this protocol dropped quickly in the mid nineties and never rose again. It was until they found a [[Piracy|better use of this protocol]]. It's a shit protocol even for file transferring, so don't get fooled by resellers that use the name as a selling point. Stick to [[BitTorrent]] like a good [[Christian]].
