A '''Gook''' is a [[shit nobody cares about|derrogative term]] for any native yellowman of [[Vietnam|Southeast Asia]] or [[Korea]]. Gooks are best known for using [[Filipinos|Human Wave tactics]] in warfare, and owning restaurants serving the best [[Alisa Kuzmenko|"Hot Dog"]] in town. They differ from [[Chink|Chinks]], as chinks are Chinamen.
<br>
There are 3 main species of Gook:
*Northern Yellow (North Vietnamese or [[North Korea|North Korean]]): Looks [[Chinese]] basically. Hates [[Americans]] (i.e. Vietcong). 
*Southern Brown: Dog-eating South Koreans or Southern Vietnamese Paddie Farmers. Also are shitty fighters (See ARVN). Will be routed easily in battle and immediately call for [[American]] support. 
*American Brown (AKA Boat People): West Coast Refugee families. Have 10+ [[Wigger|Wannabe-Gangbanger Kids]] and drive a [[Toyota]] Previa.

Clint Eastwood owns them regardless of type. Video evidence available here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Tpw1ICJEc.

Northern Gook is a [[moonspeak|complex language]] consisting of using 100 ching-chong syllables to make 1 sentence, while the written language involves many [[redundant|circles and lines]] such as these: 
*하얀 악마
*내가 당신을 죽일거야
*나 너무 흥분돼
Alternatively, Southern Gook takes the form of [[engrish|malign assbabble]] with squigglies above the letters:
*tôi rất đánh thức
*trắng uy hiếp
*con sóng chiến thuật
