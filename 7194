'''[http://sailormercury90.deviantart.com/ SailorMercury90]''' is, after [[Usagi Kou]], the most [[batshit insane]] [[Sailor Moon]] fan in existence.  At first glance, Jenny seems like the usual retarded [[Wapanese#Variant_Strains|Blasian]] Tartlet who acts like someone half her age.  (If you're curious, she's 23.)  But in reality, she's a raging bitch with a personality that makes Dr. Henry Jekyll look sane in comparison, and also continually refuses to accept the fact that [[No|THERE ARE NO BLACK PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET.]] 

==Batshit crazy Sailor Moon fan?!  The Early Years!==

According to [[Some argue|some people]], Jenny actually has a long history of [[fail]] and batshit dating back to the early 2000s, when she used to frequent the Sailor Moon fansite "A Sailor Moon Romance".  Little is known about this time.  But if available evidence is any indication, she probably gloated about how her magnum opus and the bestest Sailor Moon [[fanfic]] evar ''A Sailor Romance'' (wherein the main character of the show gets knocked up, spits out a perfect little cherub, and hangs out with Denise, her [[Original Character|OC]].) was [[unwarranted self importance|world famous and being performed on radio shows all across the country.]]  She also claimed to be pregnant by her boyfriend and named her baby Yucie, who happened to be one of her OCs.  Yucie promptly dropped off the face of the Earth once it stopped suiting her needs to pretend she had a baby (a phenomenon that she finally admitted was a prank - that she claims her boyfriend made up as a joke, which her and her friends think is fucking funny.). Then the site went down and she went to jizz exclusively on DeviantART.

==Orange Alert:  Meanies!  Jenny vs SMSues & Fandom Wank!==

[[Image:Sailorryo-ohibeatingadeadhorse1.jpg|thumb|right|Jenny's "sisters"]]
In 2006, the unfunny [[Mary Sue]] "sporking" journal [http://smsues.livejournal.com/20536.html SMSues] found one of her fics and decided... to write a summary of it and the then current version of her main [[self-insert]], Jenn'e Ichigo Toshiyba-Meioh.  Not one to stand having a bio of her character written and have it poked fun of a little, called her "[[sockpuppets|sisters]]" (including fellow tartlet "[http://angelraye.deviantart.com/ Angel Raye]", a Sailor Moon fan in her thirties whose characters look like aliens with Downs Syndrome) for backup and went raging in a few hours after it was posted, incoherent flames ablazing.  The members of [[Fandom Wank]] caught wind and jumped in to mock the whole situation shortly after.
[[Image:Orangealerticon.png‎|right|Orange Alert!]]
[[Image:Cabbitanswergirl.jpg|thumb|right|"The Cabbit Answer Girl" by Jenny, age 20.]]
What resulted was a near perfect storm of crazy.  Jenn'e and her "sisters" used every trick in the internet argument handbook to counter the [[racist]] and [[jealous]] "orange alert level meanies" with no life that dared to not believe that she was a world famous fanfic authoress and much beloved "[[LOL WUT|Cabbit Answer Girl]]".  At first, she started off with the usual: deleting the fic and [[Ragequit|ragequitting]] [[FanFiction.Net]] the first of what would be several times.  But not one to let the sporkers continue insulting <strike>her character</strike> herself, she told one of her sisters to tell the sporkers that she was going to sue them.  The sporkers merely laughed and blew her off.

The next few days would see Jenny trying, and failing, to get sympathy by claiming that her father, who died when she was 7, named her Jenn'e and that the heartless sporkers were mocking the only memory that she had of him.  When that failed, she used the old method of using her sockpuppets to claim that she had been admitted to the hospital due to stress.  After saying numerous times that she didn't care what the "evil Mary Sue society" thought and was going to stop arguing with them, she eventually realized that, when you say you're going to ignore your detractors, it helps to actually do just that.  But not before much lulz was had.

UPDATE: SMSues reviewed Sailor Heaven again [http://smsues.livejournal.com/68738.html here], giving her the same grade four years later because Jenny hasn't ever taken any good advice and improved her horrible Sue. Although Jenny and her sockpuppets have yet to respond in person, the comic that was reviewed was deleted. That'll show those meanies!

[[Image:Jennewank3.jpg|thumb|right|Daniel-kun ([http://handleydaniel9.deviantart.com/ HandleyDaniel9]) [[white knight]]s as hard as he can for his perfect virginal princess.]]
Several months after Jenny finally stopped feeding the sporkers, another one rose up to tell her how much her fics sucked.  The newest onslaught of jealousy and meanieness came from {{lj|user=papirini}}, owner of "[http://papirini.atspace.com/~papirini/kousagi/main.htm Making Kousagi Cry]", a small half broken site hosting the various pieces of uber shit that Sailor Moon fanfic writers have managed to shit out over the years and her opinions on them.  Papirini made a page for both ''[http://papirini.atspace.com/~papirini/kousagi/pages/sailorromance.htm A Sailor Romance]'' and [http://papirini.atspace.com/~papirini/kousagi/pages/lifesevils.htm some other story] where <s>she</s> Jenn'e is molested by her mother's boyfriend in a failed attempt at an after school special type of story.  When Jenny found it in her usual sweep over sites that make fun of her, the few cogs in her head started to turn.  Papirini was one of SMSues' subscribers.  So the two and Fandom Wank must have banded together in a retarded fanfic lesbian conspiracy to make her cry!  [http://papirini.livejournal.com/89534.html She went crying to Papirini] about how the "[[First Amendment|USA Amendment]]" doesn't apply to meanies and how she didn't even read the stories to begin with.  Ignoring the fact that the pages have a fucking summary about the whole damn thing on them.

After flailing like a little child at her didn't work, Jenny farted over to Deviantart to rally her fans to her cause.  Of course, she used her innocent princess persona, saying that she was merely sticking up for herself and other hard working authors and authoresses, even faking some generosity by not revealing Papirini's name so her fans wouldn't flame her.  (She still linked to the page with her name on it, of course, but it's the thought that counts, right?)  Despite claiming that she didn't want to cause drama, she also started a thread on ASMR, calling Papirini out by name this time, for [[asspat]]s from the users there and her boyfriend.  (Who surprisingly '''''does exist''' and isn't a sockpuppet'' and not surprisingly, is just as easily butthurt as she is.)  Jenny forgot that Papirini was also a member of ASMR as well, and a small flame war erupted.  All it accomplished was showing Jenny's, her boyfriend's, and her followers' love of ass-raping people for calling their characters Mary Sues.  It also eventually earned her her own section on Papirini's site and more (broken) pages about her shit, [http://papirini.atspace.com/~papirini/kousagi/pages/kwanzaa.htm including one about more racist jealous meanies] telling <s>her</s> her character to go back to [[Africa]] for celebrating Kwanzaa.  (Even though she often mentions how natural black hair is ugly and modern black culture is a [[cancer]] that should be purged from society.)

The title for this section comes from Papirini using the "If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck..." saying sometime during the whole mess.  We don't get it either.

==I DO NOT TRACE!  The Deviantart Years!==
[[Image:Mercury90stamps.PNG|thumb|left|Take note:  Money can't buy you humility, the ability to let shit go, or get you into something other than a community college when your grades are shit from spending all of high school writing and pimping your [[Pregnophile|pregnancy fetish]] fanfic on the internet.]]
[[Image:Happyholidayangelicsenshi2.PNG|thumb|right|Older, but still can't draw without a base.]]
Sometime before the Fandom Wank incident, Jenny got a [[Deviantart]] account under the name "Floranaturefairy".  As she produced picture after picture that could be drawn better by a kindergardener (nearly 20 a day at one point despite being in college), she discovered that it was easier to simply [[trace]] over pictures of Sailor Moon characters and use [[doll bases]] that were made by tracing over said pictures than it was to actually learn how to fucking draw.  All the while not crediting anyone and flaming the shit out of anyone who tried to help her.  Because sticking a link in the image description to where you got the base from takes much more effort than just bitching out anyone who tells you to.
[[Image:Happyholidaysangelicsenshi.PNG|thumb|right|Several rewrites ago/later or just didn't have the proper bases to get the characters' looks right? You decide.]]
[[Image:Hostesscallout.png|thumb|right|She's so sweet and pure and forgiving!  (Rikku/Pinkachu was a fellow former "victim" of SMSues that supported her and tried to help her improve and eventually told her to fuck off after even she got tired of Jenny's bullshit.)]]
Her chronic aversion to [[constructive criticism]] and helpful suggestions even caused her to form a club at one point.  A commenter by the name of [http://kawaiied.deviantart.com/ KawaiiED] pointed out that, since her character was black and lived in [[Japan]], it would be an interesting idea to write a story about her encountering the usual xenophobic attitudes that many Japanese have.  KawaiiED was accused of being racist, flamed to hell and back, and had all of her subscribers PMed by Jenny to tell them that KawaiiED would draw their characters wrong in commissions.  (KawaiiED actually did [http://kawaiied.deviantart.com/art/AT-Sailor-Heaven-157787500 a picture of her shitty OC as part of an art trade later].  While she said that she liked it in public, she bitched about how "kinky" the character's hair looked in PM.)  Out of the ashes of the comment's remains, the [http://otaku-senshi-sistas.deviantart.com/ Otaku Senshi Sistas] club was created to battle prejudice against multi-culti Sailor Moon Mary Sues who live in Japan.  She also plans to combat this racism in real life and show all of her detractors what for by doing what most weeaboos claim they're going to do when they grow up:  Move to Japan and become a professional voice actor.

After being called out for tracing and stealing characters and ideas from other people for at least the 4th time by [http://community.livejournal.com/deviantartsnark Deviantartsnark] in late 2009, Jenny, being a complete pussy, deleted her entire account ''the day after the post was made''.  Not having learned a damn thing from her past failures, she also created a sockpuppet "friend" in the form of "spinning-sushi-girl" in order to make those meanies who called her a tracer feel bad.  Along with a [[ED Forums]] account named "[http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/member.php?u=5276 Teletha Testarossa]" to make sure the [[EDiots]] didn't catch on and ruin her status as a sugar sweety pure maiden further.  Unfortunately, most people, including EDiots "Xazyx" and "polarbearsfudgetins", do not have the IQ and attention span of a goldfish and [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/showthread.php?p=209716#post209716 were quick to realize that] SSG's name coincidentally matched Flora's [[Voice Acting Alliance]] status of "rotating princess of the Sushi Bar".  Along with the fact that the account said the same things she did and watched many of the same people.  Her cover blown, she attacked the friends of Deviantartsnark poster "neuroindecency" (because confronting the person actually responsible is not pure and ladylike), deleted a bunch of shit, and went crying back to her [[hugbox]]s about how the mean old trolls were tormenting her for no reason.

Thankfully, she had made the "SailorMercury90" account over a year beforehand just in case something like this were to happen.  So she switched over to that account when all of her clit-sucking "friends" begged their precious hime to come back.  (Remember:  she's a world famous authoress and actress in many fandubs and shitty radio plays and HOW DARE YOU SAY OTHERWISE YOU HATEFUL MEANIE!  Nevermind the fact that [http://www.4shared.com/audio/cWE2QRq0/flora_winx_of_nature_demo_reel.html all of her voices] sound like the same black girl trying way too hard to sound like an overly perky anime stereotype.)

Not willing to learn how to draw, but desperate to escape the accusations of tracing and art theft, Jenny has taken to solely using [http://www.daz3d.com/ DaZ 3D] (a paper doll maker, but in glorious 3D!) for her artwork.  If you think she actually went and learned how to make 3D models, you are a fucking idiot and haven't been paying attention.  Instead, she uses the default models the program comes with and Mommy and Daddy's money to buy models others have made.  This gives her characters and pictures the lovely effect of changing styles from piece to piece.  <s>And she STILL doesn't credit any of the people who made them!</s>  Nevermind.  She started doing it after it was mentioned on this page.

Oh, and now she's started blocking people who aren't on her [[sockpuppetry|friends list]] from commenting on her works on the off-chance they might say something evil. This however does not prevent people from seeing her shitty works and critiquing them elsewhere where she can't control the comments, so this is pretty much pointless anyways.  She also started adding Photoshop effects to the DaZ pictures to make them look more "drawn".  But anyone who has been on the internet long enough can easily tell that they've been shooped.

{{frame|{{morphquote|DAquotes1|background-color:#ffffff; width: 700px; height: 300px;|font-weight: normal;|ok. so the overall pic is a nice render. But im a realistic type person, and being that Jenelle is from africa (like literally), how is her hair so long and "silky"? Is it,like, a weave?

===Original, ne?  The Ouran High School Hostess Club!===

{{quote|'Opinions are like assholes. everyone has one and they all usually stink.' We mean this in the nicest of manners. You can say what you want and talk all you want but since our club doesn't affect you directly we don't care what negativity you like to try and bring to us.|Attributed to "Technopoptart", but she has been inactive for months; Jenny, on the other hand, checks DA at least once a day...}}

Aside from Otaku Senshi Sistas, Jenny was also the co-founder of a club based on the anime ''[[Ouran High School Host Club]]'' called "[http://ouran-hostesses.deviantart.com/ The Ouran High School '''Hostess''' Club]".  The club involved her and 4 other Tartlets ([http://iristhefaerie.deviantart.com/ Iristhefaerie], [http://madame-onigiri.deviantart.com/ Madame-Onigiri], [http://technopoptart.deviantart.com/ Technopoptart], and [http://zenpanteki-kun.deviantart.com Zenpanteki-Kun]) pretending to be super rich high school call girls who only did a sexless version of the girlfriend experience to the other weeaboos of DA [[Bisexual|of both sexes]] while making out with the very characters said weeaboos would probably rather pretend to be with.  The whole thing is essentially one big unoriginal Mary Sue orgy and they have become deluded enough to think that the whole thing is popular enough to warrant a [[podcast]], a [[cosplay]] group (named "Hostess Chi"), a meetup at [http://www.youmacon.com an anime convention] in the ruins of [[Detroit]], another one of Jenny's famous radioplays that won't be finished, and a [[wiki]] that will be deleted a few days after this edit is made.

Of course, their idea is so original, that anyone who does the same thing has to be stealing!  That's why they went through the trouble of PMing members of the other clubs, telling them that they support thieves and they should join their Mary Sue fuckfest instead.  Jenny even went through the trouble of calling one of them out in the Mary Sue thread on ED's very own forums (along with anyone else who crossed her in the past)!  Several ''hours'' after her own club was mentioned!  Hey, she had to get the heat off of her somehow!

On January 9th 2011, Jenny and TechnoPoptart left Ouran Hostesses and started another hostess club called "[http://maidensofmusicroom3.deviantart.com/ Maidens of Music Room 3]".  (Don't worry, they're not stealing from Ouran Hostesses.  It's only stealing if someone steals from them.)  No one knows why Jenny was kicked because she gave her delete button its yearly workout after it was all over.  ([http://technopoptart.deviantart.com/journal/37599161/ Techno was kicked because she spent most of her tenure at the club on hiatus.]  The fact that Jenny probably used her as a sockpuppet to take down the "haterz" probably had something to do with it too.)  Chances are, they probably found this page or just got tired of her bullshit.  Either way, many hiatuses from Deviantart and calls for asspats for Jenny were started.  A lot of the outside media for the club that Jenny spent time she should have been using to work on school assignments and at an actual job making is still up though.  So now her Ouran stuff is a confusing and jumbled mess of half-finished ideas and revisions like her Angelic Senshi crap is.

She also left Otaku Senshi Sistas to one of the new MoMR3 hostesses.  But no one gave a fuck about that club anyway.

==Super kawaii Mary Sues, nya!  Her Characters!==
{{quote|As if on cue, the guys started to drool over Sakura’s figure. She looked like a super model or an idol singer.|''A Sailor Romance'', Chapter 7}}
{{quote|[[Original|If you don't like self-inserts bite me!]]}}

To be honest, all of these characters are just thinner and prettier versions of herself.  But since every trace of their existence will be wiped out (again) when Jenny sees this page, here they are:
[[Image:Moonheavenbelieve.PNG|thumb|right|Believe that all of this picture is Jenny's doing.]]
[[Image:Jennyouransex.png|thumb|right|Dream on, you crazy fucking diamond.]]
'''Jenelle Aria Tenou AKA Jenn'e Ichigo Toshiyba-Meioh AKA Jenn'e Ichigo Amour AKA Sailor Heaven''' - Her main Mary Sue and the cause of the most drama.  An orphan who was tearfully left behind by her poor Kenyan parents who eventually gets adopted by the show's rich lesbian couple, rips off the plot of the first season, becomes the queen of the moon, and produces a little hellspawn clone of herself with her white former villain (whom she saved with the power of her love) husband named Yucie, whom she uses to rip-off the plot of the second season.  That is, we think that's what it's about.  It's so hard to tell when the story keeps getting deleted over and over due to those mean constructive comments that sneak into her hugbox from time to time.  There is also a horrible 3D poser comic about her husband knocking her up at 16... just after <s>getting aroused over</s> freaking out over her 16 year old cousin doing the same.  Take a guess what happened to that when someone said something remotely negative about it.  Jenny keeps saying that she is no longer working on the series, opting to work on Hostess Club stuff instead.  (Jenny Moreau even "fired" Jenelle from the "studio" in a pointless story to make it official.)  But the latest revision can be read [http://www.angelicsenshilove.piczo.com/?cr=3 here,] where she thinks none of the meanies will find it.

'''Jennifer Anne "Jenny" Moreau''' -  Her Ouran character.  Jenny is a "Pure Maiden" type of [[whore|hostess]] "who is pure and innocent but holds an air of princessness to her. She can be a bit on the shy side but she tends to be a damsel in distress whenever her guests requests for her to act like one. She attracts the gamer types who want to feel like a hero saving a princess."  (Basically, everything she tries to make people believe she's like in real life.)  "She has two hosts vying for her affection. Kyoya Ootori and Kaoru Hitachiin (causing [[yaoi]] [[fangirls]] who like to watch him and his twin brother [[Incest|fuck each other]] shit their panties in rage). These two boys will do anything they can to get their pure maiden to be theirs alone."  She eventually becomes an actress and announces her pregnancy with Ootori's baby on national television before letting him know first, the bint.  (Notice a pattern in her writing?) Oh, and lest you believe that she then gives up on the other dude, Jenny has an "alternate reality" series where she gets with the [[ginger]] Hitachiin kid instead. So either way, she's cheating on someone. By the 2nd episode of the radio drama, her personality changes and she turns into a [[bipolar]] bitch in Jenny's attempt to counter criticism and give her little extension of herself a character flaw.  But all it really does is make her "Pure Maiden" persona seem even more fake.  A lot of artwork and stories featuring her are still up since all of them are made with DaZ and most of the Ouran fandom hasn't found out about how much of a thin-skinned spoiled brat she is yet.  So it would be a good idea to save that shit in case they ever do.

'''Denise "Sakura" Matsumoto AKA Sakura Toshiyba AKA Jen Ami "Strawberry Rose" Toshiyba AKA Sailor Sun''' - A "kind hearted" "sensitive" "[[Redneck|Southern Belle]]" from [[Louisiana]] who, when not saving the world, enjoys being barefoot and in the kitchen (or in Jenny's words "planting flowers and cooking for the ones she loves") in the hopes that her fiance (the [[friend zone]] only guy who runs the arcade in the show) will knock her up so she can spit out her own little mini-me.  Her least favorite subject in school is [[Irony|Drama]].  Is supposedly the first and only black Sailor Senshi.  Has powerful attacks such as "[[Dance Dance Revolution]] Whirlwind".

'''Keisha Amour AKA Sailor Sun''' -  A karaoke lover with a New Orleans accent who does stereotypical girl shit like shopping and hanging out at the beach with the other sailor scouts in a speaker-breaking radio play.  Might be a remake of Denise "Sakura" Matsumoto.  Has yet to marry her true love and have her own crotch dropping.

'''Trixie LaRune AKA Tiny Magician Pop''' -  Yet another black girl with a French last name.  This one is from the whimsical year of 20XX and fights evil as a magical magician girl in Jenny's [[rofl|completely original]] story.  But no one goes on Deviantart to look at original stuff so who cares.  Doesn't have her own white husband or crotch dropping clone daughter... ''yet.''

'''Princess Tamara Imogene Isolde del Grandivere''' - A white mage princess from a random one shot picture.  "The mage of light tends to be that of a pure hearted soul whose power is to be used for good and not evil. Though many times a mage's power is unstable and needs to be unlocked by an experienced wizard who she trusts.  All light mages are female and has been entrusted with a wizard who is often at times male."  She says she isn't going to be used for anything.  But we are willing to bet that said male mage is white and that they have a super cute daughter that's just like her.

==Hospitalized for Stress?!  Doki Doki [[Final Solution]]s!==

Her appeal as a [[lol cow]] comes from the fact that Jenny has been known to use nearly every cliched internet argument that has arisen since college nerds first started arguing about [[Star Trek]] on [[usenet]] boards in the 80s.  If you can name it, she's probably used it at some point.  A short list includes:

*[[Complete rewrite]]
*[[Delete fucking everything]]  (A personal favorite.)
*[[Flounce]]  (And then, like a retard, continue coming back)
*[[Deleting your LiveJournal]]
*[[Deleting your Youtube videos]]
*Threatening [[Legal action]]
*[[Sockpuppets]]
*[[Ban fucking everyone]]
*[[Troll shielding]]
*[[Victim complex]] ("People are attacking me because they're jealous of me!  I was merely defending my ficcies and artsies from teh ebol people full of meanieness and hatred!  WAAAAHHHH!  *Cue comically giant streams of water sprouting from her big [[animu]] eyes*")

Interesting fact:  [[No life|Observant people]] will notice that when someone is talking about or putting heat on her, artwork related to the situation or just made "as a gift" will show up on her "friends"' accounts as requests from "some people".  She also at least once donated a DA subscription to a completely random person to show how "generous" and "sweet" she was at around the same time this page was made.

==Evil people can't find me, nya~!  Other Aliases!==

Desperate to keep her gorgeously sweet fan fiction princess pure maiden reputation intact and become a [[BNF]] in spite of all of the drama that surrounds her, Jenny has been known to change and use more screen names than Hugh Hefner has girlfriends.  Also like Hugh Hefner, she tends to go for the same ones every time and does little to hide the fact that it's her.  She's like a stupider version of [[Msscribe]] in a way.  (The one this article is based on and her EDF handle are probably the most clever aliases she's come up with.)  If you would like to find out where else she's hiding on the [[intertubes]], pasting one of these into [[Google]] would be a good place to start.
