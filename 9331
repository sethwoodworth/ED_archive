'''Zach Braff'''Jew is a "[[comedian]]" best known for his 7+ years playing Dr. John "J.D" Dorian on the [[unfunny]] TV shitcom, ''Scrubs''. He is also [[2008|last year]]'s [[Chuck Norris|"little black dress"]] thanks to the [[semen|pearls of wisdom]] that ([[Captain Obvious|allegedly]]) spew forth from his lips.

==Zach Braff Quotes==

An Internet phenomenon akin to [[Chuck Norris]] jokes, '''[[Zach Braff Quotes]]''' is a [[meme]] that had been bubbling along through [[the tubes]] since [[old meme|late 2007]]. However, during the summer of 2008, these 'quotes' got a boost in the ratings thanks to being picked up by the [[Anon|Internet Meme Machine]] on /[[b]]/. Thusly, like the [[Rickroll]], [[lolcats]] and numerous other [[4chan]] favorites, '''Zach Braff Quotes''' were [[rape|thrust into]] the [[Pop Culture]] mainstream.

==The M.O.==

{{clear}}
Basically, [[you]] make up some shit and attribute it to Zach Braff. That is all. Trying to be lulzy helps but you ideally want to be as offensive <i><b>and</b></i> lulzy as possible. In other words, shit a /[[b]]/tard would say. A proper Braff quote will appear harmless or nonsensical on its own, but gain an entirely new, generally offensive meaning given the context in the attribution. 

===Correctly excecuted quotes===
Correct ZB Quotes are not funny until you read the subtext and find out what they are about. Apparently this concept is harder to grasp than the theory of relativity.

===Incorrect fail quotes===
Retards like to make ZB quotes but they can never do them right. They try to make the quote itself funny (and usually fail) but the humour is not supposed to be in the quote itself. [[Unfunny|Examples]]:
*-Sometimes Sarah [Chalke] starts to talk about Iraq or whatever and she gets all excited, like I actually give a fuck what she's saying. Come on, she's a woman. But still, it's very cute.|Zach Braff on his co-worker's politics
*-We might want to develop it so we have one just in case, but I think anything that kills black people shouldn't be obstructed.|Zach Braff on a cure for [[AIDS]]|
