{{quote|1=A very annoying Herp Derp Woman.|2="Chloe" about herself}}
'''ReactionTvz''' is a prime example of the majority of [[youtube]] users, with the exception that she supposedly resides in [[Australia]] instead of [[America|Amurica]]: lacking the ability to properly communicate, get a job, maintain hygiene, get [[friends]], and have overall meaning.  The "purpose" of her [[youtube]] channel is to lure mass amounts of [[newbs]] to watch her undergo gastrointestinal distress and fits of spasms, in turn signaling her home planet to [[pwn]] them all in responses to other random videos across the [[interwebz]].
[[Image:ReactionTVz1.JPG|left|thumb|Monsters are real.]] [[Trolling]] is encouraged to unearth whether she uses [[google]] translate ([[kawaii]] desu ne) or just mimics things from videos like a parrot to say the few English words we can make out aside from [[herp]] and the all too common [[derp]], and to discover if she actually has any [[fantard|followers]] to speak of.

If you were able to endure that, avenging those who did not make it would be [[for great justice]]. Go forth!
