'''Web 2.0''' is a buzzword that internet-savvy [[moron]]s throw around to sound [[1337]]. [[Some argue]] it has something to do with making the [[internets]] more like a normal computer application.  Web 2.0 can only be viewed from a [[Macintosh|MacBook]] or a computer running [[Vista|Windows Vista]], preferably while wearing a shirt from [[threadless.com|Threadless]] and drinking Smartwater in [[Chicago]], the home of everything 2.0. Unlike Web 1.0, Web 2.0 is constantly in Beta, like the "new" [[JewTube]] skin that is constantly being offered to be viewed as opposed to just watching videos.

Web 2.0 websites are different from regular websites because instead of using several different hideous designs like [http://worsethanfailure.com/Articles/Web_0_0x2e_1.aspx Web 0.1], [http://www.goole.com Web 0.5] and Web 1.0, Web 2.0 encourages using a single, pleasing design to ensure that all Web 2.0 sites look exactly the same.

== Things you need in order to make your website Web 2.0 ==
*[[Ruby on Rails]] -  the only programming '''framework''' sanctioned by the Web 2.0 governing body.
*[[Ajax]] - derived from "you are a jaxass"
*Lots of bubbly, brightly-colored icons, making it more attractive to [[retards]], black person, small [[children]], [[women]] and [[cats]].
*Rounded corners - right angles are strictly verboten. Someone might cut themselves or put out an eye.
*Non-threatening, safe colors: orange, green, baby blue and white. A safety feature for users on [[drugs]].
*Sam Stephenson.
*And perhaps most importantly, a name derived from a word ending in ''-er'', but with the ''e'' removed - see [[Flickr]].

== Features typical of Web 2.0 ==
*[[Social Networking]]
*[[Java]] applets that work like any other [[open source]] software, except [[retard|slower]] and more [[OTI]]
*More features that allow [[camwhores]] and [[Tawneelynne]] to share [[porn|photos]] a lot easier
*More [[Ass|backdoors]] for [[Spyware|viruses]]
*Interactivity via wireless LAN to control web-enabled sex slaves
*[[MySpace Newsletter|Un-wanted Spam]]
*More [[serious business]]
*People getting the idea that their retarded fucking opinion [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|actually means something]] because it's on [[YouTube]]
*Unnecessarily shiny graphics giving it a shitty vista appearance.

== How to sabotage Web 2.0 ==
:Annoyed by CSS layouts that ''still'' don't work on IE?

:Irritated by browser-consuming useless "addons" that don't really add 1 atom of usefulness to sites?
''

:Tired of fucking neckbearded, overweight Linux users making their sites "open source" and not letting you actually read anything?
Don't get mad, '''SABOTAGE WEB 2.0 SITES TODAY!''':
#Search "geocities metal black metal" on Google.
#Click fucking everything
#Save all .gif animations
#Make own site with stolen images
#Sell adspace
#?????
#MOTHERFUCKING [[PROFIT]]!!!

== Sites that are totally 2.0 ==
*[[Bebo]]
*del.icio.us
*[[Digg|Dikk]]
*[[Facebook|Failbook]]
*[[Flickr|Fickr]]
*[[MySpace|MySpaz]]
*[[Omegle]]
*[[Twitter|Shitter]]
*[[Wikipedia|TOW]]
*[[Yahoo! Answers|Wacko! Answears]]
*[[YouTube|JewTube]]

On December 6, 2007, [[moot|mootle]] was bored and decided [[4chan]] wasn't looking ENTERPRISE enough. That made him upgrade to Web 2.0, hoping that might attract some advertisers (fat chance, moot, even the dumbest ad network knows your site is completely unmarketable to anyone). [[btard|/b/tard]]s, like the [[13 year old boy]]s they are with nothing better to do, decided to throw a tantrum over a pointless main page layout change. In "retaliation," those same brain damaged kids decided to start spreading rumors of needing [[4chan Gold Account|4chan Gold/Platinum/Diamond]] accounts via image macros, which was humorous for a while, until everyone but the most humorless /b/tards got bored of the forced gimmick. It eventually forced moot and the [[Homosexuality|mods]] to start banning anyone who posted them.
