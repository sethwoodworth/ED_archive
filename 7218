'''San Andreas Roleplay''', also known as SARP, is a San Andreas Multiplayer community filled almost completely with [[13 year old boys]]. Although it is a [[roleplay]] server, it's as bad as [[furries]] in a chat room. Every player here strives to become the best [[internet tough guy]] on the server, which they prove by their brave use of screen capturing utilities.

==How to make a SARP server==
#Download the Godfather script from [http://forum.sa-mp.com/index.php?topic=24634.0 here].
#Delete a few bits of the script.
#Compile it and host a server with it.
#Spam your server IP across all the other servers.
#???
#[[PROFIT]]!

This is how SARP actually runs. One of the head owner's brothers was the supposed coder of this script [[copypasta]], and is praised [[Unwarranted Self Importance|(mostly by himself)]] although he simply removed or changed some parts of a huge script. He accidentally ended up bugging it so it would crash the server at random intervals thus making all the players who hadn't logged out before it [[wtf|lose all of their stats]]. The head owner's other brother is [[13 year old boy|13 years old]]. Whilst not contributing to the server and simply airbreaking through the map with hacks, he would be busy banning those who are not contributing to the server and simply airbreaking through the map with hacks.

==History==
===The Birth of SARP===
SARP started way back in 2007, with a guy who had the online handle of Marcus. Marcus was banned from multiple SA:MP Roleplay servers, then soon [[ragequit]] one server by spamming the IP of a server he had started, which was set out to be the greatest [[sheep|player]]-filled community evar. Marcus used an overused pre-made script for the basis of SARP, and forced his brothers to slave over it, scripting in absolutely nothing except copypasta from other parts in the script and commenting out any bits they didn't want, and called themselves coders. SARP was born!

In late 2008, Marcus asskissed his way to getting SARP on the SA:MP Official server list, and after succesfully achieving this status, the community grew with the addition of even more Arab and children, who are almost impossible to roleplay with due to their bad level of [[Engrish]]. Unfortunately, most SARP players are underage, and most act like [[wiggers]] and achieve orgasms over access to [[Nobody cares|admin commands]]. When they get access to said admin powers, they will abuse constantly for [[lulz]], or in most cases just to [[rape|ban]] the people they hate. After causing shit and drama on other servers, they [[fail|lost their Official status]].

===SARP's server code leak===
Sometime [[last Thursday]], SARP's FTP was hacked into and the contents were leaked to the interwebs. It was leaked when [[1337]] [[haxor]]s sent a forged e-mail via PHP to their webmaster asking for the FTP password to be sent to another e-mail address (you cannot get replies through PHP forged e-mails). The webmaster was dumb enough not to check the e-mail header and sent off the password anyway. The rip is available [http://files.uploadffs.com/1/e5a61fba/SARPAmx.rar here]. Some SARP admins claimed that it was never hacked and that [[bullshit|they released it intentionally]].

===December 2009 admin forum hack===
<center>
[[Image:Victordiditcrop.png|Victor did it]]
</center>

In late 2009, a rogue member managed to gain access to most of SARP's private admin forum, and spammed the resulting screenshots over the rest of the forum, causing epic [[lulz]] and [[butthurt]], due to the amount of shit and conspiracies the admins talked about their own players. This caused even more confusion (two admins were fired with no proof they did it, lulz) but after trying to work out who did it and failing, they just decided that a banned user known as [[h4x0r|Victor]] did it. According to the head admins, Victor knew [[Computer Science III|a lot about computers]].

===The Dethroning of Marcus===
[[Image:MikeColdfoxbawwww.PNG|right|thumb|[[Tl;dr]] [[Bawww]]fest after the server takeover]]
[[Image:YuriBawww.PNG|right|thumb|And [[moar]]]]
On the 26th of April 2010, two of Marcus's head admins called [[serious business]] with many players and [[administrator]]s in the community, and after some long, flamed debate finally decided to take advantage of the fact that Marcus didn't actually own the host, and it was actually in possession of one of the rogue admins. They used their hosting power to rangeban the Pritchard family (along with the largest ISP in New Zealand, lulz) and take over the server due to the many years of neglect. Upon doing that, they removed nearly all bans, including those on hackers, trolls, along with anyone else who would probably come back for seconds. They decided to fire just about every admin that was friends with Marcus, along with a few other oblivious admins.

{{quote|[[Unrealistic Expectations|You won't be banned]] for telling what you feel, atleast [sic] you shouldn't worry.|A banned ex-admin to another banned ex-admin.}}

On this day there were [[at least 100]] people in the [[Ventrilo]] server, with Marcus having the option to either sell them the server or be [[Oh noes|banned forever]]. They decided to steal the server from him anyway, leaving Marcus in [[Bawww|tears]].

Not being able to use the heap of shit the Pritchards created as their script (they actually [[Law|demanded copyright]] for it, lulz), SARP's [[lemon party|scripting team]] actually had something to do now.

===The Real Slim SARP===
[[Image:SARPweb10.PNG|thumb|right|120px|Marcus takes care in not breaking CSS scripts.]]
[[Image:RealSARP.PNG|thumb|center|800px|Will the real San Andreas Roleplay please stand up?]]
In his fit of [[butthurt]], Marcus decided to create a new server, which was just a clone of the old server he owned. Like many [[newfags]], Marcus believes that [[Anontalk|spamming links to his community on another community will work]]. Because of this, there were now two SARP servers, one of these just a dumping ground for whoever gets banned from the original server. All the admins who got banned from the original server migrated here, just so they could be administrators again.

Soon after this was started up, players from both communities started spamming each other's servers indefinitely, in hopes that players [[Unrealistic Expectations|would move over peacefully]].
{{clear}}

===Original SARP's Retaliation===

Players from the original server simply went onto Marcus's server and started [[Psyops|fucking up everything from the inside]]. Examples included getting faction powers and using it to spread shit fucking everywhere, and making everyone in the server San Andreas's most wanted:

<center><youtube>fZNFE4EzeE8</youtube></center>

{{quote|This "War" Has to stop. Its like the war in [[iraq]].|Some pussy on the forums, falling for this [[serious business]].}}

===New SARP's Retaliation===
After being [[pwnt]] by the [http://ng-gaming.net/ original SARP], Marcus launched a counter-attack, using old server logs he had kept (which record logins and passwords) to hijack every admin account on the game server and [[ban fucking everyone]]. Much like /b/ solutions to [[faggotry]], this was actually beneficial to the server as it cleansed the playerbase of all [[newfags]] and Arab, aka nearly everyone. Once the game server had been [[Pwnt|tanked]], Marcus then proceeded to move on to the forums and [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|do the same]], taking advantage of an administrator's [[Shit|cautious]] account security. [[Bawww]]ing players quickly flooded the forum with posts claiming [[2012|the end is near]], and anyone who didn't join [[No|the real SARP]] would die.

===He actually claimed copyright!===
[[Image:SARP-CopyrightComplaint.jpg|thumb|right|SARP players still use Internet Explorer.]]
Amazingly, Marcus got away with using his copypasta script to remove Devin's SARP from SA:MP's server lists so it wouldn't display on their server browser. This was simply done by Marcus sucking up to the creator of SA:MP, Kye. Kye immediately went remorseful towards Marcus's high level of butthurt, and told Devin to change the name and script of the server if it was to be reinstated.

Devin's SARP was now known as ''Next Generation Gaming''. The title is an absurd one and we doubt people will be playing GTA San Andreas constantly for the next 30 years. Then again they're already running a server for [[Minecraft|Chris-Chan's Extreme Autism: Underground]].
{{clear}}

===And here we go again...===
Sometime near the end of July 2010, Marcus's SARP split again into two servers. Marcus had more or less abandoned his own server, several head admins had quit, and the server was under the control of Yuri Cordozar, a Turkish Arab who was fed up with Marcus and his [[Fellatio|scripter]] who abused admin powers on their playerbase of [[13 year old boys]]. In the end, he quit and formed yet ''another'' server, known as [http://us-rp.info United States Roleplay] -  Yuri called for his friends whilst on his powerhungry rampage, splitting SARP's playerbase in half. Later on Yuri had an idea to switch from an RP server to an RPG server and reset everyone's stats.

===Moar retaliation===
Sometime [[last Thursday]], the entirety of NGG was hacked again by [[skiddie|Abbott Langley]], an ex-administrator who had been fired and banned for causing [[lulz|disruption]] within the community. Many admin accounts were hacked, many forums were raped, everyone was banned in-game, and Marcus was unbanned. These attacks continued throughout August and September, until it was found that he was exploiting the [[Shit|secure]] admin control panel with [[Rape|SQL injection]], thanks to the exploitable loopholes left by the many [[Shit|great]] web developers of NGG.

In the end, half of [[Australia]] was rangebanned again, and the entire incident was blamed on another ex-administrator and [[Computer Science III|scripter]].

{{quote|He's a [[Porn|PAWN]] scripter, he can hack us in his sleep!|Devin's reasoning behind using this person as a scapegoat.}}

===Kye's hatred===
'''The Moar You Know''': Kye is the creator of SA:MP.

Since the copyright drama, Kye has, for some obscure reason, sucked Marcus's dick to no end, resulting in NGG's server to be taken off SA:MP's hosted list whenever it appears there. Why Kye has a huge grudge against the [[CWC|true and honest]] Devin Clark is unknown.

Whenever NGRP was moved to a new IP, Kye had it removed from the hosted tab again, proving that he is obviously [[butthurt]] and [[Pedobear|watching it like a hawk]]. Kye also threatens to remove them if they make a server for IVMP, ala GTA IV Multiplayer. This is due to their developers also [[pwnt|bruising his ass further]].

===Never_fucking_ending===
Sometime [[last Thursday]], MarcuSARP's number one scripter, Zav_lx refused to [[DO IT FAGGOT|hand over his new script]] to Marcus. For this, Zav was [[Drama|fired]] and [[banned]] from the server. In retaliation, Zav used two of Marcus's [[lies|loyal]] administrators to first take down the Ventrilo, then proceed to [[Lulz|abuse script backdoors to rename all players to "server_blows_69.64.56.87:7777"]]. He proceeded to create yet another failure of a server, which was tanked by yet another loyal admin he hired, 'George'. In the end, George ended up with a server consisting entirely of non-roleplayers, while Zav has nothing.

[[Image:KaiCrossPornSARP.png|thumb|right|Why SARP isn't worth donating to, unless you're a [[sick fuck]].]]

The forums on SARP are a great dump of overused internet memes because half the members are probably familiar with /b/, or more than likely just [[Know Your Meme|know their meme]]. Being the newfags they are, SARP players will spout memes such as [[cool story bro]] at any given moment, despite it being posted 10 times in the same thread and just not being funny, [[Facepunch|although, it makes a change]].

On the other hand, the other members claim to be hardcore [[drug]] addicts, with them posting in related threads showing how [[lame|cool]] they are for doing weed. The forum also has a VIP feature, where you can pay $5 for a purple forum name, an oh-so-exciting Ventrilo tag and access to a porn forum, as if [http://www.bangbros.com these] [http://www.youporn.com sites] [http://www.redtube.com never] [http://www.wank.net existed]. There is also a famed usergroup, where people with [[USI]] can apply for this title and hope they get accepted. If they do, they will strut their so-called level of importance in threads, because they are so [[special]]. 

Regularly, admins abuse their powers to insert [[tubgirl|disturbing images]] in the footer of every page for the sick fucks of the playerbase to [[fap]] to.

===SARP players IRL===

The only amusing thread you will ever find on SARP's boards is the Real-Life Picture Threads, which is almost always a sticky in the general section. Here you can find [[niggers]], [[wiggers]] and [[13 year old boys]] posting themselves. Doing [[drugs]], of course.

A recent look at the server population showed that over 80% of the players were under age 18. 57% were school dropouts. 76% of the players considered themselves to be stoners, while in reality only 59% actually used drugs. Of these, 59% thought it was cool. Nine out of ten female players were infact males.

==Important SARP factions==
[[image:FrankHunt.jpg|thumb|left|Pretty much sums up whatever the current Governor does: Jew you the fuck out and wonder why people complain.]]
===The Senate===
[[Image:Heed_the_Warning_by_Lewis_-_San_Andreas_Roleplay_1254675862500.png|thumb|right|AND HOW DARE ANYBODY HURT THE SENATE AFTER ALL ITS BEEN THROUGH!!!!111]]
The SARP Senate is equivalent to Nazi Germany. They make bullshit laws regarding guns or drugs and change them regularly for absolutely no reason, depending on how much of an [[asshole]] the current leader feels like being. Posting negative comments about the Senate, or simply asking for it's removal, will result in an instant forum ban, due to more [[butthurt]] from the admins who watch over the senate. Raising taxes to 50% is a common occurrence. [[Communism|COMMUNISM]] [[No|HO]]

===[[Internet Police|The Police]]===
[[Image:TypicalLSPDapp.png|thumb|right|My eyes!]]
In real life, the police will arrest you if you don't do what you are told and you have no weaponry on you. Because in SARP you "don't die" and instead you "lose 30 minutes of memory from before you passed out", you'll just be killed, no matter what. You must apply to get into factions like the Police, which can be easily achieved by simply using copypasta and changing the words a little. '''''They'll never know'''''.

{{blockquote|...My many years of experience, having a trained eyesight, mastery in Numchaku Knee, knowing my way around Los Santos, my developed vocabulary in the English Language, and my excellent Marksmanship has led me to join the Force.

My grandfather was a captain of police in Los Santos...}}

That is part of an accepted LSPD application, so it gives you a good idea of what the police are like.

===[[Party Van|Federal Bureau of Investigation]]===
The FBI is generally the [[Lemon party|LSPD]] but a little shinier. Due to the amount of [[13 year old boy|13 year old boys]] in the game, the FBI is degraded to doing the same work as the LSPD and having a [[Win|hardly active boss]]. Much like the LSPD, the FBI is usually filled with egotistical faggots and [[SWAT]]/[[police]]/[[Agent Smith|agent]] [[Wannabe|wannabes]].

===Anonymous===

[[Image:Just to clarify... - San Andreas Roleplay 1254677007735.png|thumb|right|[[No|WE ARE LEGIUN]]]]

Being the tryhards that SARP are, a faction called Anonymous was created. This confused many people when they realised there was a massive difference between [[Anonymous|Anonymous of the internets]], and [[Faggot|Anonymous in SARP]], because SARP's variety contained [[anti-lulz]] and did not want to screw with the server. Once the admins were aware of their newfaggotry, they were soon disbanded and replaced by [[Gangster|other gangs]].

===The Hitman Agency===
The Hitman Agency is traditionally considered a hard organization to get into. The ideal used to be that they would select the best stealth deathmatchers. A very high kill to death ratio was critical. Soon everyone became [[nope|a professional]] at this (mostly by killing [[n00b]]s who were busy AFKing outside a hospital) and wanted to join the agency, so the standard changed to those who could take in the most cock. The more dick a prospective hitman sucks, the greater their chances of getting in. Soon, the cum overload was so much only [[Hard Gay|the most flaming]] could get an invite. They then proceeded to invite their boyfriends into the group. The former hitman director recently passed away from complications arising from several STDs, but the new director has [[Goatse|much larger tolerances.]]

==Server administration==
As the server grew, the owners saw fit to open up a series of new staff positions for moar powerhungry players to take control of. Because SARP and USRP always copy whatever NGRP does, the situation is the same on all three communities. Unlike SARP and USRP, though, staff members' [[freedom of speech]] is forbidden by Devin.

===Administrators===
[[Image:LolSARP.png|thumb|right|200px|SARP Admins use this flawless flow chart in case a problem is encountered.]]
Believe it or not, this is what the admins actually do all day:

<youtube>pI-pfpxLy24</youtube>

Be advised that the guy who made the vid insert an annotation referring to ED users as /b/tards. This is horribly wrong. When you see Draven, remind him to [[LURK]] [[MOAR]]. Even though it also claims that administrators don't do anything as described in the video, it still shows that someone is flying around in a plant pot and blowing shit up. [[GG]]

'''Moar [[TL;DW]]''': The guy who made this video has made at least 18 more. It gives you a general idea of how [[shit|great]] the administration is.

===[[Moderator]]===
The first step to becoming a video game boss, moderators are regular players who can kick, prison players, and get their own special chat channel with administrators for [[cocksucking|discussing important issues]]. Most abuse their powers whenever something doesn't go their way, get [[over 9000]] complaints on them a day, and have them resolved in their favor as the [[OP]] is usually too retarded to [[Pics or it didn't happen|post screenshots]]. Pretty much every moderator was given their power after posting nudes for the admins to see.

===[[Communist|Community]] Advisor===
[[You|You've]] sucked admin cock for recommendations, filled out a pointless application form and signed over your virginity, helped [[noobs]] (who go on to kill other players and ruin the game), and maintain that a video game is [[serious business]] - you might just be up for Community Advisor! Basically the bitches of the admin team, Community Advisors get an [[USI|oh-so-cool]] [[Gay|aqua]] tag and moar [[e-peen]]. [[Nobody cares]] about this position if it weren't for the fact that anyone who gets it is in line for admin, which is the only reason so many want [[Cock|it]], and also why so many [[13 year old boys]] have it.

===Beta Tester===
Like community advisors are to admins, the beta testers are the [[bitches]] of the development team. In the beginning, every tester was given head admin powers, which initially worked as the first group of testers actually [[Doing it right|did their fucking jobs]]. Eventually the team was flooded with [[13 year old boys]] wanting a taste of admin powers, meaning that no tester could connect to the server without [[Dying alone|dying randomly]], being [[Lulz|killed by a rocket launcher]], being [[Falcon Punch|falcon punched]], having the screen fill with penises, or having some retard crash the server with an exploit some [[oldfag]] taught them. In the end, a rank system was made, which made shit even worse as high level testers simply abused the low level ones [[Doing it for the lulz|for the lulz]], while the low level testers can't even test anything as they have insufficient powers.

==Notable Members==
Being a community designed for children and wigger kids, SARP has been notorious for its collection of [[trolls]] and/or [[retards]]. Here is a table of some of the most influential figures, who probably fucked up at least one way.

<big>'''Nick Shields'''</big>

[[Image:NickDoubleChin.jpg|thumb|left|The double-chinned [[fat]] fuck owner Nick IRL.]]
Nick came to the server in September 2008. Being a webhoster, Nick was immediately grovelled to by Marcus due to Nick's [[DO IT FAGGOT|offer]] of web hosting. Should [[Nazi|Marcus]] have ever complained about another competing server increasing its playerbase higher than a certain level, Marcus would call [[serious business]] and send Nick to DDoS, troll and/or [[Skript kiddie|hack]] said server, due to SARP's inability to cleanse its playerbase of [[wiggers]] at the risk of averaging 0 every day - or firing some of the [[retards|staff]] from their [[Lemon party|admin team]].

Nick also hosts the server, meaning he avoided Marcus's denial of getting FTP access. As such, he is free to rangeban the shit out of anyone he doesn't like, randomly delete player files and, should the server crash due to SARP's [[shit|great]] infrastructure, Nick can hand-crank restart it. After securing hosting of the forums, Ventrilo and game server, Nick used his power to [[Pwnt|overthrow]] Marcus and claim SARP with the [[buttsex|help]] of Devin.

<big>'''Marcus Pritchard'''</big>

[[image:Marcus-scenekid.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus being a scene kid as usual]]
[[Image:AdviceMarcus.jpg|thumb|left|[http://memegenerator.net/Smart-Server-Owner Marcus also gives great advice.]]]
During his time as the owner of the original SARP, Marcus spent all the server donations by himself, usually on his [[World of Warcraft]] account, or [[Meatspin|porn.]] Marcus also tried to start his own [[prostitution|singing]] career, and shortly failed. He had the entire SARP community as fanboys until he was overthrown ([[Admin|for obvious reasons]]), although if you listen to the "[[clusterfuck|music]]", you'll see how out of tune it actually is. He even has a [http://www.myspace.com/marcuspritchard Myspace] for this. However, now that Marcus is no longer an admin, [[Nobody cares|his popularity has diminished.]]

{{quote|I don't like this kind of music but I gotta admit it sounds pretty damn nice.|Ethan Rodricaz on his shitty music. [[Bullshit|Although he totally hates the music it sounds nice.]]}}

Oh, and he also likes the [[Jonas Brothers]].
</div>
<div class="SECTION4">
<big>'''Tyler Purge'''</big>

Tyler Purge was the server financier before Marcus's dethroning, leaving Marcus to pay nothing. Although Marcus refused to give Purge his own FTP account for the server, [[Moron|he still paid for it]] until Nick started hosting the server.
Purge decided one day to step up to Marcus and ask him for FTP, Marcus told him that FTP equals Fuck Tyler Purge. Even [[moar]], he still went and joined Marcus after the community split, and Yuri paying the server had FTP. Purge recently attempted to rejoin the original SARP, [[b&|much to the dislike of Devin.]]
</div>
<div class="SECTION5">
<big>'''Smo Wang'''</big>

Smo is the older brother of Marcus, and also one of the great scripting [[failure|geniuses]] of SA:MP. In fact, Smo is so talented he completely avoids asking for help at the SA:MP forums or wiki, as he [[DO NOT WANT|does not want]] to run the risk of being [[trolled]]. Now no longer living with Marcus, Smo works as a [[Towelhead|gas station attendant]].

<div class="SECTION6">
<big>'''Victor Vance'''</big>
[[File:Victorcomesout.jpg|thumb|Victor discusses his new administration style.]]
[[File:Victor_vance.jpg|thumb|Victor shares his feelings.]]
Victor Vance is a [[furry]] [[troll]]. He played on the server for a while, soon getting admin, quitting it, then getting banned for [[Baw|bawwwing]] over how the server hadn't been updated for [[at least 100|at least 6]] months, and then [http://bindtool.webs.com/Pages/Bio-JoeAndPurge.htm writing articles about it], as furries do. He is a great person to blame in case of [[DDoS]] or getting hacked, or anything else you want to spread the blame to, in case you accidentallied something and need to cover up your fuck-ups. He should be avoided at all costs as he has installed [[Gentoo]].

In an attempt to [[ban]] Victor, an admin tried rangebanning him but ended up [[wtf|banning over half of Western Europe, including some admins]]. Although Victor didn't interact with SARP for a month beforehand, [[lolwut|it was all Victors fault]]. He then spent the next 333 days secretly [[trolling]] the SARP forums until his unban. He then got [[GTFO|banned again]], and was unwelcome in both servers since everybody hates him.

However, in recent news, Victor has been re-instated on the administration team as a [[Slave|general administrator]] by Devin, who apparently believes that [[Unrealistic Expectations|Victor has changed since his old days of mass trolling and fail]]. You can see how serious Victor is about roleplay [http://www.ng-gaming.net/forums/showthread.php?95134-IC-Letter-to-the-LSPD here].
</div>
<div class="SECTION7">
<big>'''Jack Package'''</big>

Jack Package is a random [[ginger]] who joined the server in late 2009, stayed online 24 hours a day and was eventually permabanned for money farming, but was [[Blowjob|somehow]] unbanned. He eventually scored a position as an administrator, due to his [[No life|uninterrupted]] activity.

After the pwnage of Marcus, he went on a powerhungry rampage and was promoted to level 99999 admin, instantly cementing his position as an [[Final Boss of the Internet|boss]] of the server and enabling him to troll 13 year old boys who have no idea why they're being yelled at.

{{quote|My leg hurts!|-Package using this as an excuse to play games all day and being a no-lifer}}

[[ITT|ITV]]: Package getting pissed at the fact that someone had posted a complaint against his gang dragged another player and decided to ban him with his e-powers.

The story behind it was that Package got [[butthurt]] over the Triads slapping the shit out of him and a player hacking a [[dildo]]. To this very day he will kick anyone for repeating his famous line, ''speak to me or be banned''.
{{frame|{{fv|jackfaggot||font-weight: bold;

}}}}

This famous line has attained [[forced meme]] status within the boards of [[/b/|/ngg/]], after it was posted [[Over 9000|millions]] of times, recordings of it were played globally in [[Ventrilo]] by the server owners, and remixes were posted on [[YouTube]] by [[YouTube Nobodies|Abbott Langley]]. The player originally responsible for the video, [[Chink|Wu Ming]], was [[banned]] after Package saw it.

<big>'''Jake Vain'''</big>

{{quote|why do u take this game so serious chill the fuck out|Jake Vain|on irony}}

Jake has made a name on NG:RP as a wannabe [[Anonymous]] member due to butthurt after getting his permban. He went and made ''[http://nghackingteam.110mb.com/ Next Generation Hacking Team]'' to show how much he cared. To date, nobody has signed up due to the broken HTML on his site.

Jake Vain has created numerous forum accounts, YouTube videos and all sorts - hacking on a server via a VPN was [[Serious business|SERIOUS FUCKING BUSINESS]] and wanted to show the world. He mentions that he uses a VPN numerous times due to [[13 year old boy]]ism - as in thinking it is even hard to do thus makes him [[leet]].

After his 1086th ban, Jake kept taunting NGG as if he succeeded in anything. He left a [[tl;dr]] forum post accompanied with ''Not Afraid'' by [[Eminem]].

{{squote|Dear NGRP,

As I have nothing to loose, here is my public hello. Yes, you guessed right, [[USI|as a major ban evader and hacker]], I will never leave. 

To Package: You're fucking retarded. You banned a VPN that I had just recently obtained, thinking that I was the last person to use it. Go fuck yourself.

To Devin: [[o rly|I have nothing against you]]. You made a decent server that has turned to shit by ass-lickers and faggots paying for their admin position. Hope you live a good life.

To Zhao: You helped quite a lot. You're a good admin.

To Paul_Faggotniggerbitchcuntfacesinger: [[Bawww|I hope you dig yourself a hole for 2 years and die slowly in it, rotting away alive.]]

To Robbino: Decent guy, good admin. Thanks for the help.

To Scott: As much as I laughed at you, you're still a some-what decent guy. Live a nice life. I hope this closed your "investigation" of NGRAPAGE. 

To Seito: You're a dick that can't spell. I don't like you at all.

To all the other admins: Most of you are retards and asslickers, but I can still think of a few cool admins. The rest, [[Internet Tough Guy|I wish I could be right beside you now with a knife, chair and duck-tape to tie you up and cut off your fingers one by one, working my way down to your feet, laughing as you suffer]]. Fuckers.


So, again, hello! P.S. Range ban me, you range ban Madrox Poot. Yeah, I'm serious. Check the ranges for yourself, faggots.

Sincerely,
NGRapage- The hacker that will never stop terrorizing NGRP [[unrealistic expectations|until it's off the face of the internet.]]}}

Little did Alex realise that he had little to no influence in server performance, except for raising the post counts of forum trolls and giving banhappy admins the sense of accomplishment. [[GG]] Alex.

<big>'''Claudia Skeet'''</big>
[[Image:Skeetisman-Cut.png|thumb|His name is Claudia...]]
{{quote|Claudia hope you get [[Engrish|rapped]] by nigger behind your school and get AIDS.|John Morpheus|singing gives you AIDS.}}

Claudia Skeet was a known hermaphrodite. Like all [[Slut|gamegirls]], Claudia Skeet is preyed upon by all the guys in the community, with everyone e-sexing [[he|her]] upon seeing [[he|her]] in-game. What wasn't known, is that Claudia Skeet was actually at least a hermaphrodite. This came pretty clear after [[he|she]] posted "I'd tap that" in the comments section of a [[Photoshop|photoshopped]] picture of the head admin, Marcus. Marcus took the liberty of covering up his terrible acne in this shoop.

[[image:ClaudiaPokemon.jpg|thumb|She likes pokemon!]]

To confirm Claudia's hidden sexuality, an EDiot went in-game, hunted her down and asked why she deceived all those [[Basement Dweller|poor men]]. Claudia then soon got admin due to her whoring abilities, and was one of the most popular admins there because of this. She soon lost admin after Marcus got bored with her, then Nick banned her. [[Fact]].

After retiring from administration, Claudia just sat around talking about her [[sex|secks]] life in the forum shoutbox.

'''''[[Faux News|BREAKING NEWS]]''''': Claudia finally found her true love, another herm.

In other news, Claudia received an administrator position back at Next Generation Roleplay, now earning money and promotions by offering free [[Sex|services]] to [[head]] administrators.

[[Image:AaronWat.PNG|right|450px|thumb|[[What]]]]

Aaron Friesen is a generic [[lolcow]] and the best internet boss evar. After getting banned from SARP back in 2008 for his epic display of faggotry, he came out of the closet whilst in SARP's Ventrilo. After getting banned, Aaron snapped and started believing he was black, talking gibberish in Ventrilo and showing what kind of a [[fucktard]] he really is.

<youtube>RVEefGxFdso</youtube>

After this, he soon came back time and time again, not realising that nobody liked him. He then went back to Devin and Nick's SARP after the community was split, then got [[banned]] hours later since he was offered admin at Marcus's server, thus retreating like a [[pussy]].

===Wiki===
[[Image:NowEveryoneProof.png|thumb|right|Now everyone proof!]]
[[Image:The_Black_Hand_Triads_-_San_Andreas_Wiki_1254689517822.png|thumb|right|Mudkips? In my Wiki?]]
SARP once had a Wiki, which brimmed with fail and AIDs. After being constantly attacked by [[User:Fiskie|trolls]], the Wiki was taken down for a month and then put up again, and after several more page redirects and moves, the Wiki became locked for editing, the admins now claiming it to be "troll proof". In fact, it was now everyone proof since it became impossible to create accounts. The Wiki is now dead, due to butthurt on the admin's side. [[Troll]]s brought SARP's Wiki down after a lot of blanking and redirects, and replacing images with those of [[Mudkip]].

===IRC===
SARP once had an IRC server, even though the majority of 13-year-olds on the server didn't have a clue how to use it. In fact, even the admins didn't know how to use it past the right-click menus, so it wasn't worth keeping.

 [22:45] <@Lewis> Lol
 [22:46] <@Lewis> #unban
 [22:46] <@Lewis> #unban Yuri

NGRP unsuccessfully attempted to re-launch its IRC server, however history repeated itself as it did with SARP's IRC - even the [[Newfag|director of development]] didn't know how to ban people.

==Where are they now?==
Because Marcus was terrible at keeping shit together, the original playerbase have stemmed into these:

===San Andreas Roleplay 2: Electric Boogaloo===
Same as always, people are hired and fired all day every day. They maintain roughly ~50 players, so they haven't actually improved in the past two years. In fact, it's acceptable to say they got worse.

Running over other players causes lots of [[lulz]], but since this is such a [[Shit|great]] roleplay server other players will [[Lie|not instantly get up and shoot you or your car to death]] when you do. If you wish to cause even more lulz, download a copy of [http://code.google.com/p/m0d-s0beit-sa/downloads/list mod_s0beit] - a popular SA:MP hack tool, lovingly crafted by our friends at [[myg0t]], and turn it up.

*'''Site''': http://gta-sarp.com/forums/index.php
*'''Ventrilo''': ventrilo.gta-sarp.com, port 43632

===Next Generation Roleplay===
NGRP is making profits and making Kye [[raeg]], as even after taking NGRP off the hosting list, it is still the most popular SA:MP server in existence at the time of writing. Soon to bring servers to [[Minecraft]] and [[TF2]], it is expected that Marcus will follow suit to create moar community drama.

===International Roleplay===
Another heap of [[fail]] and [[AIDS]], International Roleplay originally started with the name American Roleplay, before changing its name to [[Pubic|Public]] Roleplay. Although the community maintains a playerbase lower than the amount of [[oxymoron|straight furries]] in the world, founder George (otherwise known as Doc Murphy) is as [[shit|brilliant]] as Marcus with maintaining SARP. The only thing he did was collect donations and pay for <s>the cheapest server hosting company possible</s> his gaming rig.

They are using a very bugged version of the USRP script, which George rebranded as XeonRP. George has joined every community begging for their script so he can steal it, leave, and claim it as his own. Even [[User:Starpoe|George himself]] keeps coming back to this page to [[lie|claim this server is any good]]. But remember, [[nobody cares]] as every single fucking server in this article was made by someone with no talent, wit or inspiration.

===United States Roleplay===

Yuri began slowly giving up on the server, running out of ways and methods to increase player base while he was actually destroying. He began working up on a final plan that would determine a twist for good or bad when he came up with the idea of STFU Gaming. Immediately before this idea was executed, Ethan, whom was on leave for quite some time, suddenly came back and fixed what Yuri destroyed. After noticing a huge increase in the player base, Yuri decided he was no longer needed for the success of the server and finally quit to NG:RP.

US:RP is now an independent server, cutting off external communication with any other servers to avoid being hacked or attacked by drama queens. Ethan is now the head scripter, taking his bum, stoned ass out of bed to work on scripting 24/7. He shows pride in his work after noticing the retirement of other scripters such as [[Fail|TouR]] and [[Epic fail|Adam_DeLuca]]. 

Destiney and Ethan are now running the server with Joe Cool as server manager although they claim that Joe Cool has full access to everything and is just missing the two words; Community Owner. Probably because he doesn't want to be seen as an attention whore. Joe Cool also claims ownership of the hitman faction and the gun store where any [[myg0t|griefer]] can easily encounter a gun, practically free, and go on a rampage. Good move Joe!
