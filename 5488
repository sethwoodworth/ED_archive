'''[[Faggot|Morgan Spurlock]]''',[[Image:Super Size Me box.jpg|thumb|[[Hurr|This guy just loves putting stuff in his mouth.]]]] aka "The dude who made the movie '[[Shit nobody cares about|Super Size Me]]'" Is an [[attention whore]] who fucked himself up by eating a metric dickton of [[Sperm|McDonalds food]] and [[BAW|whining]] that [[Captain Obvious|it was bad for him.]]

== Rise to Fame and Nobodyhood ==

[[Faggot|Spurlock]] later parlayed this minimal amount of fame into a TV show called "'''30 Days'''", in which [[Fucktard|he does stupid shit nobody does]] for [[OMG]][[WTF]] thirty days. One of such adventures was [[Niggers|living in a ghetto on minimum wage]], which he did for closer to [[Fail|ten days]] because [[BAW|it was too hard]] and his [[hippie]] [[vegan]] [[slut]] [[boyfriend|girlfriend]] [[asking for it|almost died.]] Yet another episode involved Spurlock surviving only on [[cum]], but this episode never aired when it was revealed that [[Truth|he's been doing this since he was born.]]

== [[Faggots|Fans]] ==

Morgan Spurlock's fans will often say how his [[Stupid|eating McDonald's for breakfast, lunch and dinner for one month straight]] was the reason they stopped eating there [[lolwut|once or twice a month.]] These people are [[retarded]], and are easily trolled by the reminder that anything, even water, if overused [[Truth|can kill you.]]
