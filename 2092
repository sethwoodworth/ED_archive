'''David Hodgkinson''', from Kent in the [[United Kingdom]], fell foul of an idiotic [[unrealistic expectations|internet-dating scam]] after he had advertised on a variety of internet dating sites.

After he [[troll|was approached]] by a Russian woman called 'Natalia', he promptly sent her £10,000 so that she could obtain a visa and purchase a ticket to fly over and meet him in the UK.  After being given a variety of arrival dates, and he went to Heathrow to meet her a total of four times, [[lulz|she never arrived]].

Apparently once bitten but not shy. Hodgkinson then tried a [[Christian]] dating site and started chatting with a woman from Senegal. [[idiot|He]] sent her £6,000 but again [[profit|she failed to turn up]]. Hodgkinson borrowed money from his [[Grandma|elderly mother]], and [[LOL WUT|remortgaged his home]] to pay for the two girls. His mother is now taking out a loan to clear his debts. "I did tell him off about keeping going to Heathrow," she said. 

[[4chan|Experts]] have warned that the internet should be [[Rules Of The Internet|treated with great care]].

'''Gill Stephens''', from Experian Consumer Affairs commented:
*''"I suspect the photos of beautiful women probably came from a [[80 year old Chinese man in panties|seedy man in a back room]]"''.

*In another recent case David Davies, 52, was ordered to pay back more than £100,000 he charmed from vulnerable women he met through online dating sites, wooing them with [[bullshit|false stories]] of life in the SAS and [[Irish282|top-secret work for the Government]].
