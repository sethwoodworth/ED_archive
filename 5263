[[Talk:Mecha-Hitler|According to experts]] '''Mecha-Hitler''' (sometimes known as '''Robo-Hitler''') is a shitty [[old meme]] from the [[comic]] ''Hellboy'' circa 2005. It's a [[fanboi|big hit]] with [[13 year old boys]] who think [[Chuck Norris]] jokes are funny. They most definitely are [[unfunny|not]] and adding anything to the '''Trivia''' section of this article will result in a [[ban]]. In fact, the only reason this meme continues to exist on [[ED]] is to show how lame one meme can be in comparison to [[300|one that delivers]]. In the fact, '''Mecha-Hitler''' under-meme itself is merely a reference to Mechagodzilla (a Godzilla's challenger in the series of flicks made by [[japan|nips]]).

==[[Bullshit|The Copypasta]]==

It would take 20 years and 600 battles spanning 4 dimensions and two colossal battles between Mecha-Hitler and Robo-Stalin but eventually the Man of Steel (who was actually made entirely of gold) defeated Mecha-Hitler and his sidekick Adolf Hitler by killing off his own Soviet people. It is believed Stalin is directly responsible for personally shooting, cooking and consuming as many as 230 million Soviet people. As well as collecting their mustaches for his vast underground collection. In Soviet Union, Stalin slaughters your entire family! Most importantly it was Stalin's use of his amazing powers of telekinesis to bring about a giant snow storm that was visible from space - The storm was so vast is blew over the invading German army and neatly buried them beneath a blanket of pure white.

Mecha-Hitler was invented/created/spawned/whatever somewhere between [[World War I]] and the [[lollercaust]]. Mecha-Hitler invented the waffle iron in his time on Earth and he still roams the seven seas to this very day. 

== History of MechaHitler == 
Mecha-Hitler was an exact replica of regular [[Hitler]] except for the fact that he wasn't [[gay]], and possesses incredible powers equal only to [[God]]. Mecha-Hitler also controls swarms of [[Brian Peppers|evil herpesinfested mutants]], and owns [[Google]]. This was never recorded in any books because Mecha-Hitler recreated the Universe [[last Thursday]] after he destroyed it by [[Denial of Service|DRDoSing]] [[God]]. FACT.
