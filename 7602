Snafu comics
{{clean}}

[http://www.snafu-comics.com Snafu comics] is a [[webcomic]] website, where all the [[webcomic]] wanna be outcasts congregate together and post their shit for [[webcomic]] [[fanbois]] to fap to. They're also have DeviantART accounts, and thus provide much faggotry as a result.

There's something for everyone!

Dave is creator of [[sonichu|Snafu-Comics]] and [[gay|TIN: The Incompetent Ninja]]. Dave is the webmaster of his site (so don't afraid to ddos it or flood his forum to make his life happier). Dave is [[prolly]] the least talented person on his own website which leads us to believe that he is hiding behind his wall of OMG POPULARZ artists to gain popularity for himself.

=== Snafu-Comics ===
Supposedly the head-honcho OMGFUNNI comic of the website. Fans are obviously blinded by the occasional chuckle you can gain from the masses of homosexual themed comics.

=== TIN: The Incompetent Ninja ===
<i>"I'm trying to figure out some kind of [[lazy|super simple stylistic look]] for this comic to make it quickly. I think I almost have a good method down but not quite. Anyhoo [[vomit|enjoy]] the comic."</i>

You know what the result [[goatse|is]].

[[Image:TIN.jpg|thumb|350px|center|This demonstrates Dave's lack of art [[skillz]] and [[unfunny]] nature. If only he took his own advice when 'It Began']]




== Bleedman ==
<i>See [[Bleedman|Bleedman's very own article]] for all lulzy details on this pedoujin artist.</i>

=== Grim Tales ===
Grim Tales is based off of The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. The comic is [[shit|decent]], [[unfunny|has a few laughs here and there]], a child molester getting his hand chopped off and incest.

[[Shit nobody cares about|Grim is a lemon party member, married to Mandy. Mandy is married to Grim. She's over 20. MiniMandy is aborted daughter of Grim and Mandy. Shakespeare fangirl. In love with her brother. Grim Jr is aborted as well. Not as smitten with his sister. They had to make out in order to lift some spell Satan made.]]




== Endling ==

[[Image:Endling.jpg|thumb|typical cam whore shot it is too]]

[[Image:Bawwww.jpg|thumb|Endling is so misunderstood]]

[http://Endling.deviantart.com/ DevianTART account]

Email: endling@snafu-comics.com

Endling is creator of Ever After. He is the [[FUBAR|fucked up emo]] of the gang, making fellow emos [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/1221853/534850545 'smile']. One of Endlings' more curious characteristics is that he thinks he is a [[wigger|nigger]]. Also, according to his latest journal, he has [[Genital Herpes|diverticulitis]] which makes him literally [http://endling.deviantart.com/journal/21727039/ 'full of shit'].
Like his pal Dave, Endling has somewhat a pencil in ass for drawing. It's a shame he's not the [http://ea.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=0 sharpest doorknob in the bunch].

=== Ever After ===
''Ever After'' is an [[emo]] comic that Endling has trouble being consistent with and has [[TL;DR|10 fucking pages of pointless intermission]] that Dave uses to whore out [[Bleedman]].

{{quote|I'd just like to mention, once again, that Everafter is a big experimental sorta progressive comic. Which means.. it's bound to change. Anyone who's been around to my DA account knows this by now, having seen Red and the rest of the cast's design overhauls since these early prologue pages.|~Endling - Making up excuses for not being able to draw the same thing twice}}




== Herms ==

[http://herms85.deviantart.com/ DevianTART account]

E-mail: herms@snafu-comics.com

[[Herpes|Herms]] is creator of [[shitty|Sticky]] Floors. He is the resident [[otaku]] having [[trace|drawn]] fanart for 95% of fandoms. A primary way to be a typical fan is to scream out that you saw him at 'Otakon' or have bought [[semen|something]] off him. Not to be confused with multiple [[hermaphrodite|hermaphrodites]].

Herms is also the artist for the [[Sonic]] Comic series comic #186.

=== Sticky Floors ===
A go nowhere comic staring Herms' characters. His style reminds [[snapesnogger]] due to a lack of [[penis|noses]]. Most of his comics are only amusing for revealing how much of a [[sick fuck|pervert]] he is, otherwise they have a [[TL;DR]] quality.

It is also a know fact that mistaking Herms for [[Bleedman]] will result into another [[TL;DR]] comic, and a [http://sf.snafu-comics.com/?strip_id=50 Wall'o text] to match. We're glad to know that we aren't the only ones who know [[Bleedman]] as the sick fuck he is. Although [http://sf.snafu-comics.com/?strip_id=47 sauces] say Herms is heading up the road himself.

== Happy ==

[http://krusnik007.deviantart.com/ DevianTART account]

Email: happy@snafu-comics.com

Happy is creator of [[Invader Zim]]: Manifest [[Peter Chimaera#DOOM: Repercussions of Evil|Doom]]. He is yet another [[emo]] tard who could [[NOT|possibly]] have talent did she not waste it on Invader Zim-bullshit. It's a given that she doesn't have much brains either.

{{quote|I feel like such a dick-head. A douche-bag. Lower than a douche-bag. A freaking worm-whore. I feel like an amoeba that's stuck on the [[underbelly]] of a worm. For those of you who don't know why, please don't bother to understand.|~Krusnik007 - doesn't like crits.}}

=== Invader Zim: Manifest Doom ===

Happy spiraled into depression when people started to think that [[Bleedman]] made this comic. If we were her, we would be glad to pwn off the responsibility for what we know is just another [[trace|fandom rape]]. The blurbs to each installment of this thriller are truly awe inspiring and well thought out. Yet she claims it's everyone else who has the simple mind.

{{Quote|Welly, well, well, look at ZIM run. He runs fast...for a 2-D character.|~Happy - showing off her vocab}}

[[Image:ManifestDoom.JPG|thumb|center|350px|She'll be glad to know we didn't pay for this]]

The [[Pedobear|great]] [[Bleedman]] has recently created a poll on DeviantArt, the title being: "I wanna try workin on a page of a different snafu title, but which one?"

Most fans couldn't help but click on the "Invader Zim: Manifest Doom" button, and the pedo is currently planning on continuing this comic. Of course, the happiness is killed by one problem. [[Bleedman]] still needs Happy's permission. Raise your hand if you think Happy will like this.

Hopefully some [[lulz]] will come of this.




== G-O ==

[[Image:Valentines.jpg|thumb|150px|right|G-O is NOT a [[pussy]]]]

[http://g-o.deviantart.com/ DevianTART account]

<i>Email: go@snafu-comics.com</i>

G-O or Giovanny Hernandez is a 22 year old [[pedo]]. He is creator of Training Wheels. He enjoys [http://g-o.deviantart.com/art/Sketch-10-Sephiroth-Kirby-57310112 fandom rape] and whoring himself out. Proof of all three of these claims can be found on his [http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=243 'guest appearance'] in the equally as shitty [[furry]] [[webcomic]] site [[VGCats]]. He also appears to be part of the 100% of tartlets who are '[[Graphic art|A Graphic Designer/Illustrator]]'.

{{quote|Interests: [[shota|Women]], anime, manga, [[shota|girls]], movies, comics, [[shota|chicks]], [[gay|wrestling]], and [[shota|boobies]].|~G-O - is a sick weeaboo fucktard}}

=== Training Wheels ===

G-O has the uncanny style to make everything he draws look like [[CP|little children]]. It should also be a trade mark quality of his that [http://tw.snafu-comics.com/?strip_id=1 everything] [http://tw.snafu-comics.com/?strip_id=2 he] [http://tw.snafu-comics.com/?strip_id=3 draws] [http://tw.snafu-comics.com/?strip_id=5 is] [http://tw.snafu-comics.com/?strip_id=6 so] [http://tw.snafu-comics.com/?strip_id=8 unfunny] [http://tw.snafu-comics.com/?strip_id=9 it] [http://tw.snafu-comics.com/?strip_id=10 hurts]

Obviously, his favorite sources of inspiration are ''Yu-Gi-Oh'', Dave and [[shota|little boys]], which are coincidentally the three things he faps to each night. Please, don't leave your kids with this man.




== Stan ==

[[Image:Quality.jpg|thumb|Such a touching piece of work with perfect grammar]]

[http://strifehell.deviantart.com/ devianTART account]

Email: stan@snafu-comics.com

Stan is creator of Titan Sphere. Stan is probably the least popular of the group, which is a mystery considering he is such an [[lies|awesome mangaka!!!]]. He claims to be mid 20's, but if we had to take a stab, we would say he was 5. At least [http://strifehell.deviantart.com/journal/14193503/#comments he has the confidence] to be that far up his own ass. Growing fanbase? [[Unrealistic Expectations]]

=== Titan Sphere ===

Dinner plate eyes. Generic story. A totally [[gay|killer]] title. Mary Sue characters. And of course [http://strifehell.deviantart.com/art/Suni-55338203 ZOMGBOOBIES!!!!]. What else does a totally [[1337]] manga need?

We warn you now, if you ever brave the depths of this [[shit|comic]], be warned that Stan has not heard of image re-size, and all his comics are fucking massive. We think he's compensating for [[cock|something]]. You also have to be aware that although his drawings are of a certain standard, that he is an illiterate dumb fuck that cannot write something readable, let alone moving.




== BlueFox & Technotroll ==

[http://technotroll.deviantart.com/ devianTART account (Technotroll)]

Bluefox Email: bluefox@snafu-comics.com

Technotroll Email: technotroll@snafu-comics.com

The n00bs of the Snafu-comics world.

BlueFox is an artist of [[Faggot|Forgotten]] [[Dick|Tower]] and creator of Soul Frontier. It is a furry, [[trap|girl]] (we think), [[weaboo]] and [[attention whore]].

Technotroll is a writer of Forgotten Tower. He is self obsessed, talentless, a moocher and a [http://technotroll.deviantart.com/art/A-shadow-s-scarlet-smile-63732123 camwhore].

=== Forgotten Tower ===

All Technotroll does on Snafu comics is write for this one piece of trash, giving proof that he is [[unfunny]]. BlueFox, obviously having the mental capacity of a teaspoon, adapts his shit to her Mary Sue characters. They're the unbeatable team!

=== Soul Frontier ===

An instant [[fail]]. BlueFox did this comic all by herself! What a [[loser|champ]]! You would have to be blind to not be able to see every character in this comic has been [[oc|copied from elsewhere]], not to mention the drawing style thieving from Kingdom Hearts and [[Bleedman]] combined. She never has anything to say about her submissions, once again showing her excellent way with words!

== Alex Pardee ==

Shockingly, it would appear Alex Pardee does not have a Deviantart, and is actually a [[Shitty_art|professional artist]]. He is only on Snafu because he's butt-buddies with Dan. Even the artists who rip off him do better art. [http://www.snafu-comics.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=37729]

{{quote|...The only requirement was that i had to eat everything, including the brains. And since I passed away recently and joined the ranks of the stench-filled undead, I figured that a little handful of brains might actually be appetizing... |He later went on the wear the head of the pig he had ate. I wish I were joking.}}

=== Bunnywith ===
This is a comic where the punchline is exactly the same in every single comic. A common re-occurring theme in the comics is bunny's penis, proving that Alex is a [[faggot|massive]] [[furry]].

On top of that, his comics feature bunnies receiving [[buttsex|anal rape]] [http://bunnywith.snafu-comics.com/index.php?comic_id=65], bunnies with vomiting ears [http://bunnywith.snafu-comics.com/index.php?comic_id=54], bunnies with anus-mouths [http://bunnywith.snafu-comics.com/index.php?comic_id=14], bunnies ripping of [[Snafu_comics#Sticky_Floors|Sticky floors]] [http://bunnywith.snafu-comics.com/index.php?comic_id=45], bunnies shitting gay rainbows [http://bunnywith.snafu-comics.com/index.php?comic_id=2], [[dickgirl]] bunnies [http://bunnywith.snafu-comics.com/index.php?comic_id=26], and plenty more of this [[sick fuck|humour]].
