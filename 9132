Woody's Sports Club
[[File:Woodys1.jpg|thumb|I can't believe I just got tossed out of this place for calling some [[faggot|faggot a faggot.]] ]]
[[Encyclopedia_Dramatica|There are very few places on the earth that will allow you to speak your mind]], and the list of those places is growing fewer and fewer each day.  In portions of South America, Asia, and Africa, the very notion that you might have an opinion other than the local ruling class very well may get your arm cut off, your wife raped, or your entire family erased from the history of the earth.  This is why it is so important to have leaky, wide-open borders in the state of [[ohio|Ohio]], so that idiots can immigrate to the state every day, and then bitch to you about how you do not “understand the plight of the *insert black person Mexican minority class here.*”

A perfect example of the type of place that will allow you to shut up, sit down, and listen to the nearest Swahili bush man tell you about his plight is a small Columbus pub house called “Woody’s Sports Bar.”  Seriously, a place that tries to pass itself off as a sports bar…even though it only has a total of three television sets and a broken foosball table…may wish to attempt to welcome many types of customers, but sadly, it seems that the place has room for only one opinion:  that everybody who is pasty, pale, and white HAS TO BE a racist.  This includes the [[white|snobby]], [[fat|fat]] bartenders who work there too.

==Introduction==

Woody’s Sports Bar is a smallish drinking establishment that manages, somehow, to do [[Fail|less business]] than the other three bars that inhabit the same strip-mall it is located in.  This lack of business may, or may not be because of the oh-so-witty customer service that is exhibited by the wait staff at Woody’s who’s main trait seems to be the ability to grunt [[idiot|stupidly]] at the paying customers that seat themselves within the bar’s tiny domain.

Woody’s happens to be located on the Ohio State University campus.  Should you wish to sit in at the pub and have a few [[alcohol|drinks]], you will be crowded by various minority groups who will purchase cheap drinks and then berate you for the next three hours because you have a better drink than they do.  Most of the patrons at the bar are working simultaneously on their green cards and on some sort of explosive device manufactured to kill Americans because they “hate” America while at the same time, they love the free shit they get in America.  

Minority customers will also explain that anybody who appears to be white has to be anti-intellectual…or a downright racist red neck because that happens to be the flavor of the month currently.  This behavior is emboldened by the fact that usually the bar employs fat, slobby college drop-outs who are still on daddy’s payroll, or because they are in fact closet fag-hags who are also self hating Jew that rival soccer moms in their vigor to make everything safe while also making smug assholes out of themselves.

==Wait Staff==
Woody’s only has two bartenders.  One of which is a normal guy who does normal things and the other of which is your typical bleeding heart liberal who found out she wasn’t fat enough to get gasteral-bypass surgery…yet.  Oh well, if you keep on sucking down those sour cream donuts, Peanut Buster Parfaits, and lonely late-night frozen four-meat pizzas, your dream of having your stomach stapled may just happen.

===Hawk===

Nobody knows what this guy’s name is.  No, scratch that, everybody knows what Hawk’s real name is except for the author of this article.  Why?  Because usually the author is usually too drunk to figure out what his real name is, or just doesn’t really give a shit enough to pay attention.  In any event, Hawk is the regular bartender you will meet if you choose to go to Woody’s on a normal evening.  He is laid back, calm, and a normal enough sort of guy to be in charge of a tiny bar and can handle the duties capably. However, when one considers these said duties amount to pretty much nothing except for pouring shots to [[16_year_old_girl|16 year old girls]], hauling empty kegs to the back alley, and laundering as much money as possible for the local street gang, one begins to realize that Hawk may just be only a few IQ points above riding the retard bus to work.

===Fag Hag Dingbat===

When you own a bar and you are attempting to employ a competent staff, one of your goals is to try to hire attractive, smart [[16 year old girl|young women]].  This action will have the two-fold benefit of getting lonely guys to spend more money in your bar while at the same time, increasing tips that the staff might receive.  It should also make it so that you have trustworthy employees. It never hurts to have a bartender with a nice ass or a nice [[tits|rack]] serving drinks.  Whoever was in charge of hiring at Woody’s forgot this simple rule during the hiring process, and hired a sour, ferret-faced over-weight slag of a woman and put her in charge of customer service.  This woman, [[faghag|Fag Hag]], is rude to customers, slow in getting orders completed (when she amazingly gets the orders right in the first place), and she exhibits a sort of late-night drunken [[USI|USI]] that can only be found when an unattractive fatty is in charge of a bar full of computer nerds and [[drugs|dope]] smoking stoner dudes.  

Because of this USI, Fag Hag will be indignant to any sort of opinion that differs from her current, mal-formed opinion.  Her understanding of any given situation is astoundingly inept and will only be outweighed by her lack of bone structure in her chin, and the massive meat flaps that she attempts to stuff into her jeans every night before she sets off to work at the bar.  Should you manage to say something that she doesn’t like, which may be anything actually depending on her current mood or mental status, due to the fact that she doesn’t really know what she won’t like on any given evening, you will be summarily asked to [[GTFO|leave the bar]].  Arguing with her will bring a bar-banning ban hammer down on your skull and the flat statement that you will be permanently barred from Woody’s…until tomorrow night because usually Fag Hag will forget that she banned you.

==Decorum==
[[File:20100520020659498 - Copy.jpg|thumb|Typical bar bullshit in the background. Ignore the angry drunk.]]
Woody’s is a typical hole-in-the-wall dive that comes complete with a sunken bar, a draft station that showcases the finest in [[Shit|Budweiser products]], and a shitty uneven pool table that is in dire need of re-felting.  Woody’s also features an outside patio where patrons may go attempt to sit and smoke cigarettes in privacy, however this privacy is usually a rare occurrence as the normal stream of drunken immigrants and [[faggot|faggots]] will browbeat any person sitting on the patio…usually because they seem to be happy, but sometimes just because they appear to be employed white people.

If you happen to slip out Woody’s back door, you will be introduced to several overstuffed dumpsters that constantly leak rotting food-stuffs thanks to the Subway that shares the same strip-mall with Woody’s.  Also, you will find garbage receptacles who aren’t visibly female either.

Should you overlook the [[woman|whores]] that populate the alley behind Woody’s, you will be introduced to the several denizens that sell and smoke pot back there.  These are the same fools who sneer angrily at just about everybody when they are out on the front patio, but will suddenly be your best friend should you produce a joint or marijuana pipe while standing around near the dumpsters.  The two bartenders at Woody’s usually do not partake of these illegal activities; Hawk doesn’t like pot, and Fag Hag is too busy recovering from the [[lol|burnt upper lip]] from the last time she visited the back alley.

==Patrons==
There is a varied bunch of patrons who populate Woody’s at any given time.  Most are [[obama|Obama]] voting idiots who stupidly cling to their failed voting choice contrary to everything that the presidency has revealed to America.  Others also include America-hating brown people who leak out from the government-subsidized housing that butts up against the strip mall that Woody’s is located within.  Some other people you might see:

*[[Kazantzakis|Kazantzakis]] – whoops, no, you won’t see him, he is banned again.
*Red-faced female activists who can’t shut the hell up and allow a man a bit of quiet time.  Seriously, if a guy wanted to hear your bullshit, he wouldn’t have gone to the bar, but in fact, he would have stayed home.
*Flexing biker guys who are just drunk enough, desperate enough, or stupid enough to try [[DO_NOT_WANT|hitting on Fag Hag]].
*People who want to punch Kazantzakis
*Foosball champions.  These patrons usually come in packs of six and somehow manage to monopolize the foosball table for 8 hours at a time.
*Unemployed computer technicians who want to fix your shit for you…then manage to spill a jager-bomb on your iPod.
*People who have actually punched Kazantzakis.
*Guys who resemble Ted Bundy in both appearance and demeanor.
*Dimwitted fast food employees.  This crowd usually shows up right before closing and manages to drink up 13 hundred dollars worth of drinks in seven minutes.
*[[fundie|People]] who don’t like the word “faggot” because it harms their [[Feelings|delicate sensibilities]].
*[[you|People]] punched by Kazantzakis.

==Overheard at Woody’s==

'''''“Dan, you’ve had enough, time to go home.”<br />
'''''“Some guy is out on the front patio and he is calling Mexican people mean names like wetback.”<br />
'''''“Random Cleveland Indians banter” This would be pertinent if the Indians actually mattered, but usually this sort of chat is about something that happened in 1997.<br />
'''''“The United States Constitution is a living, breathing document that is epic in its majestic scope. It is more than just words put down on paper, but rather it is a guideline that should be mimicked by many other nations.  In this day and age, sadly, I find that it is often overlooked, sneered at, and even downplayed by the current population of the United States.”  No, wait, this has never been overheard at Woody’s.<br />
'''''“You is rassis.”<br />
'''''“Dude, check out my totally kickass tribal ink!”  Usually overheard during Greek Week.<br />
'''''“Ah Salam Malacca.”  A traditional greeting used by most of Woody’s lily-livered wait staff and the bar’s bomb-tossing patrons.<br />
'''''“Fuck man, I’m moving to Canada because of Obama.”<br />
'''''“Fuck man, I’m moving to Canada because of Glenn Beck.”<br />
'''''“It’s pronounced NEIL PEEEEE-ART not NEIL PERT”<br />
'''''“That old dude is still out on the front patio, ranting about healthcare reform.”<br />
'''''“Oh shit, sweet Encyclopedia Dramatica shirt!  Shit is dope.  Where’d you get it?”<br />
'''''“Fuuuuu…I just threw up all over Subway.”<br />
