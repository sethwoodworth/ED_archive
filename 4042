Insub
[[Image:Insub_nico.sized.jpg|thumb|COPYRIGHT OF BRYAN "TOAST" BURNS 2004]]
Channel <nowiki>#</nowiki>insub on [[IRC]]. Where many of the [[dramacrats]] can be found. The server is private and run by the evil [[cj_]]. He banned [[girlvinyl]] from the server on October 8th [[2003]]. This made her cry.

This is where All [[Drama]] is born. You will need thick skin to stay, thicker skin to deal with the constant heckling, mocking, and random kicks. This is not a nice place on the Internet. Go play on [[Yahoo]] chat or something. They used to use MoveableType, but the [[GNAA]] saw to ending that swiftly.

This is the fun place to play on IRC - if you can't handle #insub, then you probably can't handle [[IRL]] well.

==Hepkitten cockteases Latvians==
[[hepkitten]] cannot help but be a total whore and piss off everyone that has ever lived. Because of this, insub is currently dead after a massive distributed denial of service attack launched by Latvian hackers.

Hang on...

Did I say Latvian hackers???
