Tilde
[[Image:Tilde.png|thumb|A sideways 2 can be made to look like a tilde]]
The '''tilde''' is the highest evolutionary form of punctuation. Sadly, in the primitive world that existed before [[Al Gore]] invented the [[Internet]], the tilde was virtually unused. Today, if you are connected to the web, you probably use the tilde on a daily basis.

==Archaic Usage==
;"Approximately"
:A tilde before a number used to mean "approximately". Example: "Jesus was born [[at least 100 years ago|~100 years ago]]."

;Nya
:In the dead language of [[Spanish]], a tilde over the letter '''n''' (ñ, alt+164, Ñ, alt+165) instructed the reader to pronounce it "nya". Example: "lol c u mañana", or "say wat Ñigga?"
;Uhn
:In Portuguese it is used only in the word 'mãe' ("prostitute" in English), so it is read 'muhee'.

==Modern Usage==
;Wiki signature + Timestamp
: <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki> (-1 for no timestamp, +1 for just timestamp)
;Shortcut for [[LiveJournal]] usernames
:Instead of typing http://www.livejournal.com/community/ljdramamods, type http://www.livejournal.com/~ljdramamods!  E-Z
;Make your name look pretty (often used with asterisks)
: ~*~*ChRiSSi~*~*~
;[[your mom|Your mother]]
:I fucked ~ last night.
;Crying face
: :~(
;[[Ripper]]
:<nowiki>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</nowiki>shoa
;Signature
:When signing regular letters or e-mails<nowiki>:</nowiki>
:"I hope you masturbate in a comic book, get a papercut on your nuts, and they fall off.
:Sincerely, your Lord and Master,
:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~Foamy"
;To indicate nonchalence, sarcasm or exuberance
:Whatever~
:Wheeeeee~~
;To pull down the console in any PC first person shooter since Quake 1.

==[[Wapanese]] Usage==
In this case, the tilde is used by [[retard]]ed [[anime]] [[fangirl]]s as a failed attempt to sound "cute", when placed between the body of text and an exclamation mark. This is highly retarded and not advisable if you want to get through life with your [[balls]]/[[vagina]] intact. It is wholly observable in environments where [[Wapanese]] and [[Otaku]] populations are especially high. You should notice that describing these populations as [[n00b]]s and [[retard]]s is extremely redundant, as Wapanese people and Otakus always match this criteria. In the "AngloJapo Dictionary" tilde is defined as "a failed attempt at punctuation OR gaining internets OR life"

;Examples
:"Araaaa~!"
:"Haaai~! ^__^"
:"~Baaaaai~! *Hugz*"
:"[[Nyoro~n]]"
:"[[desu|desu~]]"
