It is a mystery
[[Image:Itisamystery.gif|center]]<br/><br/>

Fucking old [[SomethingAwful]] [[old meme|meme]], an [[emote]] of a ghost with the phrase "it is a mystery" that was apparently based on an even [[gay]]er image macro, based on an even older Fat Chicks in Party Hats saying, which actually explains the mystery. For some reason, that reason being that [[goon]]s will steal anything from anybody else and lay credit to it to prove "the forums are still funny", shaming even [[Fark]], lapped it up like it was comic gold, and the little [[lulz]] it had was killed in record time by people using it in nearly every post. [[At least 100]] [[unfunny]] parodies were made of it.

Showing the restraint typical of a goon, some [[retard]] bought the domain [http://www.itisamystery.com/ itisamystery.com] because [[lies|it's totally hilarious guys]]! Then they ran out of money because they were [[poor]] and the website was deleted.

==Why is this flyer pink?==

Of course, just having it is a mystery as a painfully unfunny emote wasn't enough for one [[faggot|SA poster]], who started up a thread entitled [http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=1725837&perpage=40&pagenumber=1|"Why is this flyer pink"]

For some reason, despite the amount of sheer [[stupid]] contained within, "Why is this flyer pink", coupled with the inanity of "It is a mystery" became an SA forums meme to last a very long time. [[ALLCAPS|GOD THAT THREAD JUST KEPT GOING]].
