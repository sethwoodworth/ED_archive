[[Chix0r]], the only EVAR (or first EVAR) [[no women on the internet|female on the internet]], is a [[dying alone|thirty-year-old]] ([[fake bisexual|closet heterosexual]]) [[lesbian]] female currently thriving in the United Kingdom, [[bestiality|most likely somewhere in Wales]].

She is the feared "[[fail|Director of Community Relations]]" (a role she stole from the greatly loved King $[[Lolly]]) on the popular (t)[[shitty art|art]] site [[DevianTART]]. Her career began there when she joined [[last thursday]], either in disguise as a man, or wearing her favourite dykey Nazi uniform. Once on the site she managed to seduce $[[homosexual|Tachy-on]] with her butchness (he's the gay on dA), whom then decided to aid her in her [[user:poliwhorelovesyah|evil, evil, evil]] plan to overthrow $[[Lolly]]. (See below.)

Once in power, she and her fellow "''lesbians''" (they're actually just men in makeup - $Heidi; $Moonbeam13) <s>all became best friends and lived happily ever after</s> founded the [[feminazi]] movement on dA, killing off all [[sysop|male admins]] or turning them gay through the use of their resident fag $Tachy-on - one example of this faggotry is PurpelBlur, who used to be so cool till they got to him.

{{quote|"fucking nazi", "idiot admin", "stupid assholes don't like nudity" (wtf???? lol) or the best one yet... "they're jealous of my art skillz so they remove it".|Chix0r|complaining about the [[sarcasm|TOTALLY UNFOUNDED]] criticism of her administrative style.}}

Currently [[Chix0r]] is continuing her [[Jimbo Wales|reign of terror]], now turning the once much loved forums into a [[vagina|fascism-hole]]. She's also launched a new campaign of hatred on the [[deviantart|proletariat]], now using her [[admin|Lesbian-help-desk-pawns]] to ban every member that even looks at them [[lulz|funny]]. Of course, her evil totalitarian scheme could not be carried out by ''just'' the [[admin]]z alone, this is why she decieded to create the *gaspshockhorror* the MN@!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!11111one!111!!

On Feb. 3, 2009, Chix0r posted a very [[lulz]] worthy journal entry showing some more of the cracks in her armor of psychosis.  After [[Realitysquared]] posted earlier that tracing was acceptable on deviantART, much wailing was issued forth.   As community director, chix0r rose to the occasion and informed the community they were idiots and she doesn't have to listen to them.

===New Faggotry===

[[Image:Chixbeingdramatic.JPG|thumb| chix0r, once again proving that the quickest way to a peaceful resolution to conflict is by fanning the flames further, while insulting the intelligence of the opposition. Classy!]]


Recently (July 10, 2010), ol' chix0r took a shine to a [[sick fuck|delightful young man]] by the name of [http://mathewlove.deviantart.com/ ''MathewLove''], who was experiencing many [[troll|stressful]] comments in relation to some pictures [http://mathewlove.deviantart.com/art/SPCherub-142279121 in] [http://mathewlove.deviantart.com/art/Cherub-captive-108872267 his] [http://mathewlove.deviantart.com/art/Cherrub-lay-108746005 gallery]

The [[pedo|average user]] was undoubtedly outraged at the sight of boycock, and trolled Mathew into oblivion. ([[some argue|some speculate]] that Mathew himself is a troll, but he has yet to make an outright statement to verify this.)

After seeing all the extremely mean comments being flung at this [[bullshit|poor, innocent user]], she immediately did the first thing her small, attention-whoring mind could think of.

[http://chix0r.deviantart.com/journal/33446816/ '''She made a DeviantArt Journal entry about it.''']

Proving that she's not to be outdone in the field of spreading [[drama]] and [[faggotry]], she sought to try and claim some of the attention that [http://forum.deviantart.com/community/art/1479572/ this forum post was generating.] Continue the argument found within for great lulz coming from both sides of the fence.

In typical chix0rian fashion, she proceeds to blindly champion her cause, whilst ignoring all opposition, under the false pretense that she is somehow [[lie|better than everybody else]]. Hordes of her watchers come to her aide to intercept the ensuing shitstorm (because god knows she can't be bothered to lift a finger to do anything around the site.)
As this is very current drama, it is impossible to predict how this will all play out, but in the end, one thing is certain:

chix0r has once again proven what an unprofessional, ignorant old twat she really is.

== Blackmail ==

Chix0r has apparently also blackmailed another TARTlet's attempt at <s>making the site better</s> trolling the administration and forced her to deactivate her account. [[Image:chixblackmail.jpg|thumb|BLACKMAIL!]]
