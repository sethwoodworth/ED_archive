The standard response of the functionally illiterate when taken to task for their sins against the mother tongue is to label the offending party a '''Grammar Nazi'''. [[Kimmo Johan Alm|Some go as far as to ban users from forums for using bad grammar.]] "Heil Grammatik" is a common saying for Grammar [[trolled|Nazi's]]. Everyone hates '''Grammar Nazis''' because they are the ultimate [[lulz killers]].

==The Worst Kind of Nazi==

As stated previously, Grammar Nazi is a term given to one who incessantly corrects the spelling/grammar/usage of others.  While the label is certainly an apt one, it is rarely, if ever, effective in its intended role as a sort of mini-invocation of [[Godwin's Law]], because true Grammar Nazis, like their Teutonic forebears, have absolutely no qualms about their dedication to their fascist cause, nor their obsession with purity and order. "If the proper use of 'who' and 'whom' makes me a [[Nazi]]," thinks the Grammar Nazi, "then it is a fair price to pay for the cause&mdash;and, if a few half-assed constructions and poorly structured interrogatives need to die in the gas chambers for that same cause, then so be it, for it is a good cause."

Ironically enough, the epithet is all too often rendered "Grammer Nazi" by its oblivious user, further fueling the fires of the devotee of linguistic purity so labeled.

Perhaps the most well known and influential post modern grammar Nazi ever to troll the land of face-space is Porpy. Nobody know's his origins or his intentions. Only that he single handedly annoy's the living shit out of every teeny-bopping, word-abbreviating, English-language-maiming user of Facebook. He has the ability to strike anywhere at anytime. mAd Repz y0!

==Historical Linguistics==
Giving murky and unwholesome depth to the phrase "Grammar Nazi" are the actual origins of many of the grammatical conventions they wield as "law." Many of them were [http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~spike/ling290/badEnglish.html invented by self-appointed grammarian twats of the 18th century] who decided certain things were mistakes because they thought English should work more like [[Latin]], wanted a more "perfect" language, or were just anal control freaks.

From a linguistic and historical standpoint, these "mistakes" are completely artificial, having very little to do with how language is actually understood by [[Mundane|normal people]] and having everything to do with egocentric [[Asperger's syndrome|aspies]] trying to systematize the English language, which is nigh-on impossible because English is a [[Genital Herpes|dirty]], [[Queef|sloppy]], [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] [[slut|whore]] of a language.

The very label "Grammar Nazi," which implies that there is even such a thing as a legitimate, totalitarian standard for English, is antithetical. If someone is proud to be a "Grammar Nazi," he or she is ignorant of the English language's history, is parroting grade school textbooks, and has very little claim to intellectual superiority.

A Grammar Nazi particularly goes into a retard [[divide by zero|divide-by-zero]]-mode when they are confronted with the reality of constructs they hate.
For example, the commonly used "singular they", made famous by scholarly writers whose [[ghey]] literature makes them wet their fursuits with adulation.

==The Grammar Nazi Flame War==
[[Image:Your.gif|thumb|right|150px|...mother!]]
'''Grammar Nazis''' are prone to a curious form of geek [[cat fight]]ing wherein they try to outdo one another by finding and correcting increasingly more obscure errors in each other's comments. Whoever identifies the final and most obscure error (preferably the one that requires a consultation with a resident linguist at Cambridge to understand) wins, and evidently has the bigger [[cock|e-penis]]. Should you ever encounter a Grammar Nazi [[flame war]], it is highly recommended that you do not attempt to drive or operate heavy machinery for several hours afterwards as there is no experience on earth quite as mind-crushingly boring, except perhaps two [[Anime|anime]] [[fangirl]] '''Grammar Nazis''' debating the fine points of ''Japanese'' grammar.

==As a Drama-Generating Technique==
The tendency towards Grammar Nazism can be exploited as a drama-generating technique in several ways:  

===The Wild Hunt===
[[Image:Sex and Grammar Nazis.png|right|thumb|150px|Grammar Nazis and sex do not combine. (Spot the typo, go on)]]
After a particularly pretentious Grammar Nazi (such as [[Hardvice]]) has posted something entirely [[tl;dr]], a simple comment that states "grammatical errors: 5" will induce abject hysteria as the author attempts to locate and justify the alleged errors.  This will invariably bring the author's Grammar Nazi friends and enemies into the fracas, and many long hours will be spent on overly grandiloquent name-calling and heated arguments about what's merely a non-standard but acceptable usage and what's just fucking wrong.  Eventually, at least two of the Nazis will declare an [[e-Jihad]], and unfriendly drama will ensue over the highly contentious split infinitive question, followed by each side signing the other up for bestiality porn newsletters to which each will later [[masturbate]] in secret.
==== The split infinitive question ====
The idea that split infinitives are not ok was invented by pretentious twits who had latin beaten into them when they were schoolboys. They are perfectly fine in english, and I defy anyone to come up with a non-split-infinitive way of saying "they are perfectly fine" without sounding stupid.

''For the non-gramar nazis, 'are fine' is an infinitive.''

===The Grammar Trap===
Another variant requires the [[troll]]ing party to lay a grammatical trap, so to speak, by intentionally [[rape|raping]] the language and lying in wait for the Nazis to spring.  The [[troll]] then responds with either the [[image macro]] above, or perhaps a [[Fifty Hitler Post]] combining [[marquee]]d Hitlers with [[marquee]]d text to the effect of "LOL, GRAMMAR NAZI!!!!"  Naturally, this is most effective in communities of, say, [[Holocaust]] survivors, or alternately the overly sensitive (such as anything with "liberal", "conservative", or "feminism" in the name).[[Image:YourRetarded.jpg|thumb|Typical Grammar Trap]]

===The Grammar Smackdown===
Simple Grammar Nazism is rarely enough to cause the terminally stupid much stress; however, correcting the entire post using [[strikethrough]] tags and red font tags and then assigning it a big fat F will almost invariably cause the victim to do just about everything short of posting scans of their grade school report cards to prove that they are not in fact [[retard]]ed.  Since the subsequent comments will without exception contain new errors to correct, the troll can keep this one up indefinitely.

For extra credit, you can print the original post, make all the marks using a red pen, write "Please see me after class" or "Unacceptable" near the grade in loopy, teacher-esque handwriting, and scan the whole thing in as an image.

The [[HTML]] markup required for the Smackdown is:
 <nowiki><del>grammer</del> <ins>grammar</ins> </nowiki>
      <del>grammer</del>            <ins>grammar</ins>
WORTH THE EFFORT

==Notes==
* Grammar Nazism is not to be confused with its egalitarian cousin, Grammar Socialism, in which everyone is free to [[yiff]] the English language until all of the punctuation and caps get jumbled and eventually fall out. (See: [[AOL speak]].)
* This article automatically loses, according to [[Godwin's Law]].
* Grammar Nazis have forgotten that the English language takes a bit of a breather on [[teh internets]].
* Grammar Nazis, in all their apparent mastery of the English language have not yet got round to checking a dictionary for the meaning of the word "grammar". A spelling mistake is not a grammatical error; there is nothing grammatically wrong with the exchange "'O RLY?', 'YA RLY!'"
This idiot doesn't know that  "oh" is an interjection, it is used when there is a reference to a noun,really is an adverb, therefore it is incorrect to use oh with really.
* Grammar Nazism was used to great effect in the exquisite movie ''Secretary'', whose storyline revolves around Maggie Gyllenhaal and an [[BDSM|S&M]] relationship with her employer, James Spader, who punishes her quite severely for spelling errors.
