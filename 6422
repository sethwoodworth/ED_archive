[[File:Pink poodle animation.gif|frame|right|See this? This cute little thing will [[banhammer]] the shit out of you.]]
'''Pink Poodle''' is an ED [[Sysop]] and your "friendly" local [[gaming]] Czarina. It was once rumoured that this lovely lass was [[fucking|banging the shit]] out of MIA ED Sysop [[User:Pierced|Pierced]], but it has since been revealed that [[asexual|there will be no dick or pussy worthy of her hot pink pussy]].

For further insight into Pink Poodle's worth here, head over to the [[Portal:Gaming|Gaming Portal]]. See the pages that both look good and are interesting to read? That's probably her. For some reason she also is a [[mod]] of [[EQ2Flames]]' PVP and Battlegrounds section. How she stays (marginally) sane is a mystery. She is also almost always [[disease|sick]] and longs for the day when she can release [[swine flu|what]][[AIDS|ever]] [[acne|she]] [[Narcissistic personality disorder|has]] upon the world. If you play the game ''EverQuest II'' and are on the [[Christian|good]] or [[gtfo|exile]] side of the [[Nagafen]] server, you may have killed her in PVP. More than once. Don't feel good about yourself though. That's like being proud of blinking, everyone's done it.

Despite the name, Pink Poodle is '''not''' a [[furry]], so don't even bother fgt.

==A Day in the Life of Pink Poodle==
[[File:Pp2.jpg|thumb|right|This doesn't happen. Ever. [http://www.yelp.com/biz/pink-poodle-the-adult-theater-san-jose Apparently it's a trashy place.]]]
#Wake up.
#Take a shower. Skip breakfast.
#Play [[MMORPG]]s until lunch.
#Look in fridge, don't bother making lunch, return to computer.
#Edit ED articles and patrol recent changes while trolling EQ2Flames at the same time.
#Snooping in MMORPG communities to dig up [[Lulz|dirt]].
#Dinner time. One cherry tomato will do.
#Record a video of some dumb shit bought at a flea market for 2 cents, such as a pizza cutter that plays music when used.
#Stay up playing [[MMORPG]]s again.
#Go to bed.

[[TL;DR]]: Pink Poodle doesn't contribute to society.
