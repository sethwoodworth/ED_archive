[[Image:Swenglish-060819-288.jpg|thumb|Littlefair whines about ED]]
[http://swenglish.s10.forumsplace.com/ Swineglish] ([[Swenglish]]) is a rarely visited [[forum]] set up by [[Littlefag]] and [[Ass Vegan]] after being banned from everywhere else on the [[Internet]] for being [[lame]], the sole purpose being to whine about being banned, talk about how great they are, and beg dirty, lonely, skanky [[whores]] for free [[sex]]. They misunderstood the advice "you need to get more [[pussy]]... and leave me alone son, I'm your fuckin' mom for godsake!" as meaning they should increase the tonnage (and acreage).

During its short lifetime, Swenglish went down more than a sorry [[crackwhore]] at a frat party. On August 17th, 2006, [[Littlefag]] took it down on purpose as a public expression of how [[butthurt]] he was about appearing in [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|Ã¦]]. This is believed to be the only intentional outage in the history of Swenglish. In response to the [[lulz]] at this, Swenglish was reinstated along with a post explaining why the [[forum]] was [http://swenglish.s10.forumsplace.com/viewtopic.php?t=288 recently offline].  At last count Swenglish had been fucked up by [[Littlefair]] [[at least 100|at least a hundred times]].

== Anti-Troll Measures ==
To date, [[Littlefag]] (self-proclaimed [http://swenglish.s10.forumsplace.com/viewtopic.php?p=989#989 "king of the trolls"]) has at various points implemented the following anti-troll measures on his canned phpBB forum:
* Setting account activation to require manual admin approval
* [http://swenglish.s10.forumsplace.com/viewtopic.php?t=215 Requiring users to log in to read the board]
* Randomly banning anonymous proxies.
* Banning the letter L in usernames (way to go, superadmin!)
* Randomly deleting accounts of completely valid users.
* [http://swenglish.s10.forumsplace.com/viewtopic.php?t=188 Banning Googlebot] ([[WTF]]???)

The point in [[trolling]] this den of douchebaggery is somewhat mitigated by the fact that [[Littlefair]] regularly breaks the board as a result of his own technical incompetence.


== Swenglish Drama ==
Swenglish is a petri dish of [[Internet drama]], The original members all fled from [http://www.thelocal.se/discuss The Local] after their [[attention whore]] tactics were ignored or ridiculed. The primary purpose of Swenglish is to talk about The Local.

=== Pity Party ===
Immediately upon starting a new [[forum]] with [[Littlefag]], [[Ass Vegan]] started a discussion about why people left [http://www.thelocal.se/discuss The Local] called, [[drama]]tically enough, [http://swenglish.s10.forumsplace.com/viewtopic.php?t=10 How were you abused on TL]. 

Some choice answers:
* [http://swenglish.s10.forumsplace.com/viewtopic.php?p=73#73 I was abused by spammers/trolls for having opinions, and one well-established TL member really insulted me when he criticized my new apartment.]  --[[:User:Kitten75|Kitten]]
* [http://swenglish.s10.forumsplace.com/viewtopic.php?p=261#261 We are all the misfits not deemed quality enough to post our opinnions, that TL site is nothing but communist. It is like burning a book and that is seen as communist in the US so let the little commies have it this place is much better]  --[[Ass Vegan]]
* [http://swenglish.s10.forumsplace.com/viewtopic.php?p=887#887 I too have never been banned from TL but I have been trolled and abused. That place is just riddled with trolls. Someone needs to shine the sun on that forum and turn 'em all to stone.]  --[[:User:Kitten75|Kitten]]
* [http://swenglish.s10.forumsplace.com/viewtopic.php?p=1614#1614 To complete nutcases have started a hat campaign against me and are giving grief to all I know. They contact my ex, they contact my old friends, they contact my new friends. stiil I smile though the methods they try are insane. They dont have the balls to attack me so they attck others to annoy me.]  --[[Littlefair]]

=== Love Triangles ===
At least two internets love triangles played out their drama in part on Swenglish.

'''[[Ass Vegan]]/[[Ass_Vegan#Blondie|Blondie]]/Esme''': Ass Vegan, true to his previously established pattern, couldn't survive without constant female attention for two whole weeks while Blondie was on vacation with her kids and partner. He moved in on Swenglish newb Esme, who in a vindictive fit of female rage produced cybersex logs and cock pix at the demise of the e-affair. Blondie or ''Brian's bit'', as she signed at least one email, publicly proclaimed that the status of her involvement with [[Ass Vegan]] had been "just friends" however several blog entries and email tell a contrary story. Unfortunately Blondie managed to get her [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] page removed.

'''[[Littlefag]]/[[Littlefag#Christopher_Walken|Andersson]]/Benzed''': Littlefag had taken up with the married Andersson in Gothenburg, and after a clandestine weekend with her in a hotel in Malmo, came clean about the fact that he was an unemployed deadbeat dad. At this point, Andersson, at loss for a way to extricate herself from the relationship without arousing [[Littlefair]]'s psychotic rage at being rejected, played the "I'm going to focus on my marriage" card. Little is known about what transpired, however even after promising her husband that she would cut Littlefag out of her life, she continued to loiter about his forum. Around the same time, Benzed, a 30-something unemployed New Zealander living with (and off of) his girlfriend, became a staunch defender of Andersson's virtue. It's unknown whether the Andersson/Benzed affair has been consumated, however it is definite that Benzed would enormously improve his situation were he to score a sugar-momma like Andersson. As he is given to trawling [[MySpace]] for the [[Pedophile|JB]], it doesn't matter that she looks like a [[pro-ana]] rodent.

=== Preferred [[:Category:Drama-generating techniques|Drama-generating techniques]] ===
* [[Attention]] - First and foremost, Swenglish caters to [[Attention whore]]s. The result is a constant resurrection of old drama and quarrels that occurred on forums from which the primary Swenglish posters were banned. Also prominently featured are inane posts about nothing just for the sake of posting something. 
* [[Internet stalking]] - Every user on Swenglish has been [[stalk]]ed [[at least 100]] times. Mostly by each other.
* [[Alcohol|Posting Drunk]] - Fully half the users of Swenglish (not including [[sock puppet]]s and banned users left on the list to make it look like more than six people post) are raging alcoholics who suffer from [[Internet poor]] disease. They somehow manage to pay their ISP bills and buy the booze, possibly funded by selling their children's toys.
* [[Cat fight]]ing - Given the number of middle-aged [[camwhore]]s and [[drama queen]]s on Swenglish and the propensity of [[Littlefag]] to bring down the [[banhammer]] on any potential male competition, regular catfighting over e-cessibility to Littlefag's [[Erectile dysfunction|alcohol-induced limpdick]] breaks out. This often results in the loser either [[quitting IRC forever|quitting forever]] or being banned, only to return a few days later.

== Notable (L)Users ==
[[Image:Zoe.jpg|thumb|"Blondie" shows off her acreage]]
* '''Aneud''' - a [http://aneud.livejournal.com/ fat Romanian] [[camwhore]] who only posts pics of her cleavage on [[LiveJournal]]. [[Littlefag]] made her a moderator in the hopes that someday she would let him cum on her saggy tits.
* [[Ass Vegan]] - [[Littlefag]]'s partner in the pursuit of the pipe dream of heterosexuality.
* [[Ass_Vegan#Blondie|Blondie]] - the Southern Charms pr0n star [http://www.southern-charms3.com/zoe/main.htm Zoe4you].
* '''Dakyras''' - Buttboy "admin" who wishes he was [[Littlefag]].
* '''Esme''' - The Tart du Jour causing strife between [[Ass Vegan]], Blondie, and [[Littlefag]]. Otherwise, a completely non-notable [[Internet]] [[slut|bimbo]].
* '''Jason''' - Neocon flunky who mostly sniffs around hoping that Selena will spread her legs.
* '''[http://allpoetry.com/Knocklegoggin knocklegoggin]''' - [[Littlefag]]'s bank account, nappy changer, sheet washer and sperm receptacle.
* '''Ms._Divine''' - a trailer park queen who surfs for [[cybersex]] while chain smoking Virginia Slims and whippin' herself up into a pussy batter frenzy.
* '''Selena''' (AKA 'Shrill'ena) - the only chick on Swenglish worth seeing naked, unfortunately she\'s dumber than a rock with all the charm of a 13yr old boy's jerkin' sock.
* [[Littlefag#Christopher_Walken|Voodoo]] - [[Littlefag]]'s [[faghag]] slag.
