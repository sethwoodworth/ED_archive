Krimpet

'''[[Wikipedia:User:Krimpet|Krimpet]]''' is a former [[Wikipedia]] [[admin]] who is still an active sysop at the [[Wikimedia Commons]]. She's a [[nerd]]y [[boy|girl]], being an [[undergraduate]] in [[Computer Science III|computer science]]. However, it was recently revealed that she is [[MTF|a male-to-female transsexual]], which came as little surprise to most, [[Kelly Martin|this being Wikipedia]].

Like [[Sceptre]], Krimpet is rather [[Maturity|immature]], as he believes that [[Ad hominem|insulting]] the [[vandal]]s is the best way to tackle [[Grawp]] and co., despite this being contrary to what [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Do not insult the vandals|other Wikipedians suggest]]. This was proven at the Wikimedia [http://test.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=renameuser&user=Krimpet&page=&year=&month=-1 Test Wiki], where he renamed Grawp's accounts to suggest Grawp was a [[loser]] after he'd revealed Krimpet's [[dox]] but was kind enough to spare the most [[Shit nobody cares about|crucial information]] from being made public. Her pathetic attacks against Grawp fell on deaf ears, however, as Grawp is a [[freedom fighter]] rather like [[V]] whose idea cannot be destroyed.

Krimpet is supposedly the one who discovered that Grawp was [[JarlaxleArtemis]] and discovered [[:Image:Grawp's Mommy.jpg|Grawp's mommy]].  And Krimpet is supposedly the one who made jeremyhansen.info, a site full of Grawp's dox, which Grawp's mommy sued and got it taken down.  But then again it could've been [[NawlinWiki]] who did all that.

Krimpet has also wormed her way into the [[Bedford]] controversy, by suggesting that Bedford's DYK hook was "[[offensive]]" to female editors. Krimpet was just one of a few "female" editors who experienced [[butthurt]] over something very, very trivial and inoffensive to anyone who isn't a [[batshit crazy]] [[feminazi]]. Although she has often been described as vigilant but quick to make mistakes, she [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=19340 rooted out] a recent sockpuppet correctly for once.

Some have suggested that Krimpet was actually a [[sockpuppet]] right from the start. Despite the fact that she only began editing in January 2007, her [[deletionist]] [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=18814&st=20&p=111345&#entry111345 tendencies] and broad knowledge of the [[Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines]] were clearly apparent in her first edit, as if without warning a "female" doppelganger of [[Sceptre]] had appeared from nowhere on the [[USA|other side of the pond]]. She had her [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Krimpet|RfA]] only a few months later, and totally succeeded.

Krimpet's dox were originally put forward by [[Daniel Brandt]] on his Hivemind page, as noted by [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=18596 the Wikipedia Review] (only visible for members). Since then Krimpet has continued her batshit crazy feminazi antics by [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/August 4|userboxes not allowing]] heterosexual male Wikipedians to state which color of hair they prefer women to have, and the [[Wikipedo]]s all agreed with her, despite the fact that they encourage [[LGBT]] and [[Dickgirl|alternative]] sexual orientation userboxes everywhere because they're more [[politically correct]]. Go on, [[Bedford]], my son, fight that [[feminazi]]. See also a [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=19766 Wikipedia Review] thread about this and Krimpet's bitching.
