Pollfest
{{Spoilers|[[P-p-p-powerbook]] wins}}

'''Pollfest''' is ED's quest to find the greatest article in its five years to celebrate [[ED5|this momentous birthday]]. From an initial pool of 160 articles picked out by [[Sheneequa]] and [[EDF]] users, it has been trimmed to an NCAA style bracket of 64. [[Chris-chan]], [[P-p-p-powerbook]], and [[Chris Hansen]] are early favorites.

Prizes can be won by [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/showthread.php?t=3108 submitting your own bracket.] Possible prizes include paid accounts, shirts, and the SUPER COVETED [[Joseph Evers]] autograph.

Pollfest takes place on the ED Forums using polls in vBull. Also yes we know vBull sucks, deal with it. You have to register on the forums (takes 3 seconds) to vote or view these threads.

All pollfest info can be seen at the ED5 board on EDF, located [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/forumdisplay.php?f=44 here]. Be sure to check it at least once a day as that's how often polls will roll over.
