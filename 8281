'''''The Onion''''' is a [[satire|satirical]] newspaper with a presence both [[IRL]] and [[OTI]]. It is who all EDiots dream to work for, if they can first escape their [[basement]].

While ''The Onion'' can be entertaining, essentially it's the product of [[packers|frat boys]] from [[Mad]]ison, [[Wisconsin]] who are somewhat aware of the world around them, but who are still fucks who'd never make it in [[New York]] if they hadn't started their own newspaper. Within its chosen sphere, ''The Onion'' succeeds, but when folks there want to get beyond that range, it [[fails]]. See the scene in ''The Aristocrats'' where the folks at ''The Onion'' get a chance at writing their own version of the [[epic]] joke for documentation of these incontrovertible facts. See Madison, Wisconsin to see how [[basement dwelling]] they actually are. You have to be pretty pathetic to go from frat boy to basement dweller.

As with [[old media]] comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', [[you|everyone]] reminiscess about a time "when ''The Onion'' was funny." ''The Onion'' was proven not funny five years ago, or when [[you]] were a junior in [[high school]], whichever was longer ago.

==[[Internets]] use==

Even though ''The Onion'' is desperately [[old meme]], there are still people on the internets who don't know that it's not a real newspaper. These people can be effectively trolled by sending them ''Onion'' articles. For slightly smarter people, copy-pasting an ''Onion'' article into an email or [[blog]] post while leaving out identifying information works well.

The canonical example of ''Onion''-[[troll]]ing occurred when [[Christian]] pro-life blogger "Pete", of [http://marchtogether.blogspot.com March Together for Life], ran across an article called "[http://www.theonion.com/content/node/33680?issue=4227&special=1999 I'm Totally Psyched About This Abortion!]" and mistook it for reality. He wrote a [http://marchtogether.blogspot.com/2006/07/murder-without-conscience.html ridiculous post] about how awful young women are these days and how [[abortion]] has created a culture of murder in our country and other [[serious business]]. 

When people called him on it, he got [[butthurt]] and claimed that women really do think that way, and then he tried to claim he [[I did it for the lulz|did it for the lulz]], but eventually he gave up and went back to [http://www.monthlycallforlife.com harassing people about baby-killing].

== [[YouTube]] channel ==

As of march 2006 The Onion also has a [http://www.youtube.com/user/TheOnion YouTube channel], which uploads satirical news videos regularly. The actors communicate the news in a really straight-faced manner and in a professional environment, trying to make the viewer believe that they are being serious. The videos uploaded are divided into different shows, all satirizing the shows on regular news channels. 

=== The shows ===

The different shows on The Onion:

*'''Today Now''' - Parody of a typical morning talk-show that submissive soccer moms watch while ironing clothes.
*'''Onion Sports''' - Testosterone packed program about [[duh|sports]]. Perfect for [[closeted]] rednecks.
*'''O-Span''' - Exposing the incompetence of real life politicians by acting just as [[retarded]] as them.
*'''Newsroom''' - [[shit nobody cares about|The most important]] news of the day!
*'''In The Know''' - Political debate about important topics, such as [[lol wut|wether baby-skull jewelry is ok or not]].

Even though a fair share - maybe even the majority - of the videos uploaded by The Onion are really [[boring]], there are definitely some gems in there, containing lulz. Hilarity is absolutely sure to ensue, as there is always that retard who believes that the show is for real, and spouts "HURR it is teh politically incorrect!" in the comment section.

==AV Club==

The Onion's [[lesbian]] sister site, which contains [[SFB|todally seriouse]] reviews of [[shitty_bands|music]], [[TMNT|television]], [[anime|movies]], and [[yaoi|books]], where sad, depressed wannabe [[hipsters]] and fan boys lurk below in the putrid sewers of the comment sections.  It's basically [[Pitchfork_media|Pitchfork]] except no one [[evar]] gets [[sex|laid]], [[evar]] (some of them may have [[marriage|wives]], but the point still stands). 

At least [[at_least_100|half]] of the comments contain [[shit_no_one_cares_about|lucid, thoughtful cultural discourse]], and [[drama]] is minimal (except [[you|one user's]] trolling of several other users with [[puppets]], and the composition this article). [[troll|Trolling]] is easy, and often appears in the form of:
* Saying the American Office is better than the British Office
* Mentioning Animal Collective or any other successful band
* Nitpicking the [[shit_no_one_cares_about|letter grade in a review]]
* Examining an interviewee's smugness (if it's a guy) or fuckableness (if it's a [[girl|laday]])
* and making a statement about it
* [[manga|A Falcon]]
* Also, they still use "[[FTW|For the Win]]" and [[first|firsties]] and all that other [[gay]] [[faggot]] [[shit|crap]]

There are four notable types of users on the boards:
* [[Fat_nerd|The Condescender]]: a [[fat]] [[gay]] registered user who posts dissertations on [[shit no one cares about]], like why the upcoming Hollywood remake of [[Bravestar]] is going to be terrible. His [[college|bachelor's in English/Creative Writing]] gives him the right to compare everything to what he was forced to read, but didn't finish, in his British Literature to 1800 class. He may [[bullshit|claim]] to have a [[internet_girlfriend|girlfriend]] or [[wife]]. He is probably [[you]].
* [[teenager|The Ill-of-the-Dead Speaker]]: a [[gay|ravenous]] [[troll]] who posts tasteless jokes in RIP blog postings under an unregistered name, usually it's the [[CAPTCHA|captcha code]] or a [[not_funny|clever pun]], because he's an [[anonymous_pussy|anonymous pussy]].
* [[Asperger's syndrome|Diarrhea of the Fingers]]: a sad, sad member who must make 100 posts in every article he reads, pushing his total post count to [[over 9000]], literally. He suffers from either severe [[ronery]] or profound mental [[retardation]], nobody can figure out which. Seriously, this guy needs help.
* [[no_girls_on_the_internet|Chicks]]: there are also some guys who post as [[sluts|chicks]] under  [[mary_sue|various user names]], none of them clever.
===Forced Memes===
A number of enterprising users make use of the [[anonymous|anonymity]] of the internet to [[forced meme|force their own memes]] via [[sock puppet|puppet accounts]]. All memes on AV Club are unwelcomed, and thus forced, and include the following:
* Caruso: [[anonymous|someone]] posts something with a [[not_funny|clever]] pun or something under the name "David Caruso". "[puts on sunglasses]" is in the middle somewhere and a [[trying_too_hard|way, waaaay forced]] "YYYEEEAAAAAHHHHH!!!!" is at the end. Other users post as [[Mexican|international]] versions of David Caruso, with foreign equivalents of said "YYYEEEAAHHH!!!!"
* Canceraids: when someone posts a "firsties", other users wish him death by cancer, aids, cancer/aids, canceraids, aidscancer, acid rain, leukemia, or [[sex|SIDS]].
* Celebrities: users often register names of obscure or nostalgic celebrities, and sometimes post in character (David Caruso, [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[etc]]).
* Corky: a [[retard]].
* Black Bolt: "[[not_funny|...]]"
* Pretty Pretty Princess girl: based on an oft-appearing ad from the Onion Personals, wherein some [[slut]] professes to be "a nerd, a girl nerd" who likes guys that "can make me laugh and call me a pretty, pretty princess."
* Ratatouille: we pretend to like this [[animu|children's cartoon]] on AV Club.  Yep.  We pretend it was good.
