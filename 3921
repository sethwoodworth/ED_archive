"I Did It For The [[Lulz]]" (IDIFTL) is a [[catchphrase]] which serves as a blanket explanation for any [[troll]]ing you do or any [[internet drama]] you cause. If you are experiencing [[troll's remorse]], saying "I did it for the lulz" three times out loud should  clear your [[conscience]], therefore cleansing your soul in all circumstances...(also see [[offended]] if that doesn't work).

Encyclopedia Dramatica is proof that doing something for the lulz is the only reason to do anything; trolling for anything else is a [[crime]] worthy of [[Trolls Trolling Trolls|being trolled yourself]]. IDIFTL is also [[Truth|the greatest legal defense that has ever been used]], second only to the [[bullshit]] claim of [[insanity]] or pleading the 9th.

While doing it for the lulz on the Internets is a perfectly acceptable excuse to do anything, doing so IRL can have [[rape|painful]] consequences, especially if your attempt fails. But success in doing so will usually guarantee you a place in the [[anal|annal]]s of history, as some of the individuals and groups below will attest to. But regardless of success or failure, doing it for the lulz is ALWAYS worth it. In fact, doing it for the lulz is the best thing anyone could ever hope for.

== ED Guideline ==
[[Image:4tehlulz.jpg|thumb|In the Philippines they always do it for the lulz]]
It is [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] policy that anything is acceptable if it was done for the lulz. An article and edits are only valid if they were made for the lulz. If you find an 
article that was not done for the lulz then it is [[shit]] and should be re-written or deleted.


If you find an edit that was not done for the lulz, plz hit up the editor's page and [[vandal|vandalize]] the shit out of it. <nowiki>{{unwelcome}}</nowiki> tags should be applied [[liberalism|liberally.]]

==Noteworthy occurrences==

Doing it for the lulz has a long history with noteworthy people. Of course, the most noteworthy on-line occurrences done for lulz are [[LJDrama]] and [[Frienditto]]. Other notable occurrences include the following:

===[[so cash|Johnny Cash]]===
[[Image:Fonz-did-911.jpg|thumb|This photo was created for the lulz]]

Johnny Cash became the ultimate lulz pioneer with his song "Folsom Prison Blues," which became famous for the lyrics "I shot a man in Reno, just for the lulz." Soon [[Fox News]] began blasting Johnny Cash for being the baddest motherfucker on the planet, to which Johnny got even more lulz.

[[Your Mom|The man in black]] went on to write "Ring of Fire," relating the story of his filming of the legendary [[Zippocat|Cat on Fire]] video + screencap, the x-rated version, of course, hence the name "Ring of Fire." This was his favorite source of lulz next to [[CP|child pornography]] which, coincidentally, is one of the few things that gets the lulz anymore.

Of note is the song "Cocaine Blues" where Johnny sings "I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down, I went right home and I went to bed I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head" Although not specific in the song, anything containing cocaine and guns is done for the lulz.

Johnny also crashed his winnebago once into a wildlife reserve, [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|igniting the whole forest]] and nearly destroying an entire endangered species of buzzard. When questioned why he did it, he stated simply "I did it for the lulz"

Johnny became an [[emo|emofag]] due to contracting [[Troll's remorse]] in his final years. During this time period he performed a cover of the [[fag|NIN]]'s song: "[[Butthurt|Hurt]]," which was originally written by Trent Reznor. In it, he talked about his [[Cutting|atonement]] and remorse for his lulz-motivated actions. Shortly thereafter, he passed away. A full-scale autopsy revealed that fatal levels of [[Anti-lulz]] had flooded his [[Ass|immune system]].

===[[Julia Gillard]]===
Julia Gillard became an entrepreneur for the lulz in Australia when she took a knife, stabbed Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in the back with it and stood atop his broken corpse to become prime minister of the [[worlds largest prison]]. This would result in lots of political dramaz. After the dramaz finished she gave a glorious speech on lulz, passionately claiming "I did it for teh lulz gaiz". 

===[[Iraq]] [[War]]===

When asked about the War in Iraq, [[George W. Bush]] was quoted as saying: "I did it for the [[lulz]]".

===[[Pulling_a_Lynndie|Abu Ghraib]] ===
[[Image:Lynndie England.jpg|thumb|right|"Just following orders," was Lynndie's response when first asked why she stripped men naked, [[Put Shoe On Head|placed bags over their heads]], and then [[Win|jeered at them with a cigarette in her mouth.]] ]]
The mini-sequel to [[Iraq_war|Gulf War 2]], Abu Gharaib will be forever remembered for [[lulz]] and [[buttsecks]].

''See also: [[Pulling_a_Lynndie]]''

===[[God]]=== 

[[Martin Luther King|Martin Luther]], in his book [[BDSM|Bondage of the Will]] (written [[at least 100 years ago]] to troll the [[Shotacon|Catholic Church]]), expressed that man had no control over his [[sin]] unless God first [[buttsecks|penetrated]] someone's consciousness to bring them to [[Jesus]]. Luther made clear that few would encounter this "holy [[rape]] of the soul," and that God predestined both these [[President Barack Hussein Obama|elected]] people as well as [[furry|those people who would consciously suffer hellfire for all eternity]]. Given Luther's prophecy that [[Westboro Baptist Church]] would alone comprise the residents of [[Heaven]] and that the remaining billions of [[fag|fags]] and [[faghag|fag enablers]] were destined to be burned forever by God in the presence of Jesus and Phelps, for a Godly reason the Bible describes in [[tl;dr|the book of Galatians]] as an unknown "purpose unto Himself," we can conclude the universal [[truth]] that God is, ultimately, doing it all for the lulz. Post this holy [[fact]] on pretty much any Christian forum for a guaranteed [[Christfag]] shitstorm and subsequent [[troll]] banquet on which to feed. 

===[[Jesus]]===
The birth of Jesus was another memorable repercussion of "doing it for the lulz," as [[God]] thought it would be funny to [[Holocaust|fuck with the Jews]] and their [[Religion]]. God also did it [[feels good man|to get away with raping a virgin]].
[[Image:Jesusisacunt.jpg|thumb|All for the lulz.]]

===[[9/11]]===
The widespread myth that 9/11 was a reaction to [[US]] imperialism and support of [[Israel]] is just that--a myth.  On a tape release by [[Osama bin Laden]], he [[Osama bin Laden#Osama_before_9.2F11|admits to doing it for the lulz.]] Osama bin Laden did claim responsibility for 9/11, but in actuality the [[JEWS DID WTC]]. [[Some argue|Many theorize]] that they did this for the lulz, but others cite the [[fact]] that [[Jews]] have no <s>sense of humor</s> soul or dicks. Osama decided to release the tape anyway just for [[MOAR]] lulz.

===flashman===
In addition to the lulz-inspiring 9/11, a [[LiveJournal]] user created a [[fake_journal|fake journal]] of a man that supposedly died in the 9/11 attack. When exposed, while unavailable for public comment, she confided to her friends "I did it for the lulz." The LJ community, however, views it as [[too soon]].

===[[Juliana Wetmore]]===
God created Juliana Wetmore, or disfigured her, for the Lulz.

===WarGames===
Lyle Watson: I mean have you gotten any insight as to why a, a bright boy like this would jeopardize the lives of millions?

FBI Agent George Wigan: No sir. He says he does this sort of thing for fun. 

Very early internetlulz.

===[[Cripples]]===
[[TL;DR|Need I actually explain?]]

===[[Hitler]]===
[[Image:ForLulz.jpg|thumb|It was known Hitler committed many atrocities "für die lulz". He also enjoyed golf.]]
Before [[Hitler]] an hero'd, it has been recorded that he said "I don't understand. I just did it for the lulz." It took [[at least 100 years]] for people to notice that killing [[Jews]] is lulz worthy, making Hitler ahead of his time. Nowadays Hitler is considered to be [[an hero]], and many people go back in time to vote him.

===[[Al Gore]]===
It is widely believed that Al Gore created the [[Internets]] and [[Global Warming]] for the lulz.

===[[Godzilla]]===
Enjoys visiting japan every once in a while, just for the lulz... [[Image:GodzillaLulz.JPG|thumb|No one knows why he does it, scientist believe it's for the lulz.]]

===Diego Rivera===
Diego Rivera, a Mexican painted a mural depicting Lenin on a Rockefeller Center wall during the [[communism|Red Scare]] for the lulz.

===[[Michael Jackson]]===
[[Michael Jackson]] has done it for the lulz from [[At least 100 years ago|at least the 80's]], when he set himself on fire during the filming of a Pepsi commercial. "I'm glad that everyone is laughing," Michael Jackson said from his hospital bed, "the lulz give me warm tingly feelings." Soon, however, the warm tingly feelings for the lulz was replaced by warm tingly feelings for [[rape|raping]] boys. At his recent trial, he was acquitted of all charges. Speculation remains on whether or not this was the fact that he broke down and screamed, "[It] was all for the lulz!" and moved the jury to tears of laughter. '''AND NOW HE'S <s>DEAD</s> A ZOMBIE!!!!111'''

[[Image:Brandon-3.jpg|frame|Brandon "I told u I was hardcore" Vedas, lulzing IRC in '03.]]

===[[Ripper|Brandon Vedas]]===
As Smoke2k can attest, Brandon '[[Ripper]]' Vedas was lulzing the [http://www.shroomery.org Shroomery] chatroom up when he [[An Hero#External Links|overdosed]] online for the world to see.

===[[Budd Dwyer]]===
When Pennsylvania State Treasurer Budd Dwyer was caught for bribery and receiving kickbacks, he pulled one of the greatest lulz maneuvers in history: avoiding jailtime by blowing his brains out on live T.V. [http://www.nothingtoxic.com/media/1152099034/Budd_Dwyer_Commits_Suicide_at_a_Press_Conference Hey man, nice shot.]

===[[Kevin Whitrick]]===
The only proven way to avoid [[troll's remorse]] is to become [[an hero]] as part of the troll itself.  This maneuver was deftly executed by [[Kevin Whitrick]] who pulled a [[Saddam]] for a live audience on an "insult chatroom" on Paltalk, combining the best of [[Ripper]] and [[Budd Dwyer|Budd]] all in one go. "When Kevin stepped off the [[chair]] and was left dangling, the mood in the chatroom changed." [[O RLY]]?

===[[Maury|Maury Povich]]===
Maury Povich, host of The Maury Show, has been doing it for the lulz for [[at least 100 years]]. The Maury Show (more like the MOAR Show, amiririte?) has only one possible plot: A black woman, [[User:Sheneequa|Shaniqua]], comes on and accuses Jamaal of being her baby daddy. However, [[Jamal|Jamaal]] denies it, because Shaniqua is a [[Cock Trapper|lyin' ho]]. Then, we find out whether Jamaal really is/is not the father. Many [[lulz]] and [[drama]] ensue daily from this program.

===[[Hiroshima]]===
[[Image:LULZPLATE.jpg|thumb|In teh Arizona they do it for the lulz]]
[[Image:Nebraskalulzplate.jpg|thumb|In teh Nebraska they also do it for the <strike>lulz</strike> Corn.]]
J. Robert Oppenheimer and some other [[geek]]s built an [[Hiroshima|atom bomb]] that was going to become unstable and possibly fizzle. Knowing that this bomb was a verifiable [[evil]] machine, Harry Truman dropped it on wonderful [[Asians]]. This story has a poor moral, as some say that Truman later had a case of [[IRL]] [[Troll's remorse]].

===[[Adult Swim]]===
On January 31st 2007, in an unusually lulzworthy stunt, [[Adult Swim|Adult_Swim]] launched the entire city of Boston, MA into terror when the masses mistook electronic [[ATHF Terrorist Attack|light boards featuring a Mooninite]] for [[terrorist]] bombs. In a fit of [[Troll's remorse]], the company apologized, stating: "We are still trying to understand where it all went wrong, we just did it for the lulz." We commend Adult Swim for the resulting [[lulz]] and [[drama]]. Consequently, Adult Swim was also done entirely for the lulz of seeing what would happen when adult material was placed on a children's channel. 

===Dale Earnhardt===
Dale Earnhardt would have been an [[an hero]] if his entire fan base wasn't [[rednecks]] who mistakenly believed to him have died of accidental causes during a crash on the lap last of a 500 lap race. When interviewed before the race Earnhardt was quoted as having said "Don't tell the fans, but I did it for the [[lulz]]". Oddly however, when asked why Earnhardt wasn't required, or even encouraged to wear the proper safety equipment that would have saved his life, both NASCAR and saftey gear manufacturer Bill Simpson confessed to doing it for the [[lulz]] as well. Earnhardt's wanna be [[an hero]] death also makes especially good bait for trolls unfortunate enough to reside in the same area as [[rednecks]].

===[[Your Mom]]===
Your mom did [[everyone|it]] for the lulz. see [[16 year old girls]].

===Bill Clinton and your mom===
Bill Clinton had teh [[buttsecks]] with your mom for the lulz. See [[Monica Lewinsky]].

[[Image:formorelulz.png|thumb|right|Osama did it for teh lulz.]]

===Prohibition===

The Prohibition Act of 1920 is, in itself, a tale of epic drama. With the bill passed by Congress, president (and lulzless democrat) Woodrow Wilson, feeling a case of Troll's Remorse, decided to veto the bill just because he felt that banning alcohol would detriment the status quo (some have debated that the veto was done for the lulz as well). By foreseeing the limitless potential of lulz and drama that would ensue if Prohibition were to be in effect, Congress pwned the president's ruling by a 2/3rd's majority. What would occur during the Prohibition period would be the Golden Age of Lulz. No person was ever hungry for lulz during this period, as everybody was in uproarious laughter throughout the 1920's thanks to the drama that occurred. Thanks to this event, the preceding decade has been dubbed as "The Roaring 20's."

===Vietnam War===

The [[Vietnam_War|Vietnam War]] was started by the [[French]] who were startled by monkeys in southeast [[Asia]] and promptly surrendered to them. Meanwhile, in Hanoi, Ho Chi Min Laden decided that he really liked the color red, so the [[Jewnited States of Americunts|United States]] freaked the fuck out and sent in troops. Some people said this was because the South Vietnamese were fighting against the [[Communism|communists]], but really it was for the Lulz.
[[Image:Collateral_Damage_Motivator.jpg|thumb|left]]

===U.S. Invasion of Panama===

When realizing that the [[United States]] was about to close in on his estate, Manuel Noriega, the brutal dictator who persecuted those who practiced the lulz in [[Mexico|Panama]], clenched in fear at the Americans and their arsenal of lulz at their disposal. Reflecting on the Iran-Contra scandal and the lulz that ensued, Noriega ran straight into the Vatican Embassy and declared sanctuary (after years of analyzing the situation, lulzosophers now agree that this act was done for the lulz). After the U.S. realized that Noriega holed himself into an Embassy, they played blaring music to barrage Noriega with wave after wave of lulzy music for the situation. Some of the music played included such "Danger Zone," "Trapped in the Closet," and "Panama." After a few days, Noriega finally surrendered to the United States. When he was declaring his surrender, Noriega was laughing so hard that he almost died of a lack of oxygen.


===Jokela High School Massacre / Pekka-Eric Auvinen (aka NaturalSelector89 / Sturmgeist89)===

Sturmgeist did it for teh lulz. For real - check the translation of his manifesto; http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2007/11/8/141636/531
While running through the halls of Jokela High School he was reported to have been yelling "its OK everyone I'm just doing it for the lulz!"

If you missed who this guy was, did the Finnish high-school massacre.

===Vtech===
The fucked up yellow nigga was all about the lulz. after setting his dorm on fire, and fucking his invisible, imaginary, supermodel bitch didn't satisfy his insatiable lulzlust, he shot a buncha other /b/tards who were not about the lulz.

===Marcus Junius Brutus===
Brutus was <strike>a hardcore motherfucker</strike> pansy-ass senator who <strike>single-handedly killed the president</strike> cut a bitch with the help of like, sixty other guys. When asked WHY he did such a devious thing, Brutus was quoted as saying, "''cachinnorum causā chock fēlacio, lulz''". Today, old people around the world re-enact Brutus' cowardly act in a series of [[Lemonparty|citrus-themed parties]]. Like a lua, but with more wrinkly buttsex.

===Richard Nixon===
On June 12, 1972, Nixon hired some people to [[Divide by zero|attack]] the [[Democrats]] by trying to wire tap them and other shit. Even though he [[Fail|didn't succeed]] in destroyed the [[Democrats|fags]] he secretly just wanted to do it for major lulz.[[Image:RichardNixonFarewell2.jpg|frame|"I am not a crook, I just did it for teh lulz."]]

===[[Tim McLean]]===
On July 30th, 2008 a [[fag]] was decapitated in a greyhound bus. His killer was [[Shit no one cares about|azn]]. No one cares about him  though because hes [[Juggalo]].

===Killing People while attempting LULZ===
Doing it for the LULZ [[IRL]] is sometimes referred to as "Depraved Heart Murder" by [[E-lawyer|legal counsel]] representing the [[dead|deceased]] and their [[butthurt|loved ones]].

===[[Josef Fritzl]]===

Josef Fritzl is an [[Australia|Australian]] who imprisoned his daughter for 24 years and had several children with her. He had held her captive in a small, soundproof and windowless cellar in the basement of the family home in the town of Amstetten in Lower Australia. Fritzl is suspected of having begun abusing his daughter Elisabeth in 1977 when she was 11 years old. Later he was asked by the police why he did that and he answered "I didn't want to upset anyone I just did it for the lulz". [[Pedobear]] was deeply pleased.

Decorations:
He later got an award honoring his lifework. He became the EM-Maskottchen (mascot) for the soccer championship EM (Europameisterschaft) 2008 which took place in his home country Australia.

===[[L. Ron Hubbard]]===
Most [[moralfags|non-scientologists]] believe that Hubbard created [[Dianetics]] and [[Cult|Scientology]] for the <s>money</s> lulz

===Brandon Darby===
Brandon Darby, an [[hippie|activist]] from [[Texas]], revealed himself as an [[FBI]] informant [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/us/05informant.html]. In his open letter, he wrote "Those involved were correct when they wrote that I wasn't making my choices for financial reasons or to avoid some sort of prosecution," leaving only THE LULZ as a reason for doing it.

===[[Jett Travolta]]===
An alternate theory on the death of Jett Travolta is that he couldn't bare to live with his dad's [[faggotry]] and realized he might just be better off becoming [[an hero]], which is quite lulzworthy.

===[[New York]] Activists take over [[College|NYU]]===
[[Image:Nyu occupation screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Another lulzy occurrence mistaken for [[serious]] [[anarchy|direct action]].]] NYU SDS [http://takebacknyu.com/ occupied their school] in Feb. 2009. With [[cop]]s threatening to kick their [[hippie]] asses outside, they were asked by the [[media]] why they bothered. "We did it for the lulz."
<br clear=both />

===Todd Marcum===
Todd Marcum was pulled in by the cops for using a shock collar on his kids. Of course, he knew that he could get in a lot of shit for punishing his kids with that kind of device, but it's okay, he wasn't doing it to punish them. He quite literally did it for the lulz. [http://www.videosift.com/video/Man-Admits-Using-Dog-Shock-Collar-on-His-Kids-for-Fun]

===Writing Viruses===
In an article on Tech Republic, [[expert]] Chad Perrin explains that people write viruses for the lulz: "Do It For The Lulz: Some still do it for the “fun” of destruction. They may get a thrill out of reading news items about their work causing people trouble, or they may just take a fire-and-forget approach, creating destructive, self-replicating programs for the joy of it without much caring whether they ever see the consequences themselves. Mostly, I’m sure they find it funny to read about people being inconvenienced by what they’ve done. In short, some people write mobile malicious code for the same reasons vandals break windows and spray paint garage doors that belong to people they don’t even know."

===[[Balloon Boy|Balloon Boy]]===

<center><youtube>WwQTx5oXn2U</youtube></center>
<center><small>Just in-case you missed it.</small></center>

On October 15th, 2009, a 6-yr-old boy by the name of [[Falcon Punch|Falcon]] Heene pretended to be riding his [[batshit insane|dad]]'s massive helium balloon sitting in his backyard (because that's [[mundane|normal]], right?) when it took off into the sky. His brother claims to have seen him go inside the balloon, but Falcon actually ran up to the attic of his house. A nationwide media scurry occurred as the balloon traveled tens of miles to a desert in the middle of nowhere, during which time the FAA, FBI, and [[over 9000]] local and national media outlets broadcasted the hunt for Falcon and his balloon.

Eventually, the balloon landed. Authorities found no sign of Falcon in the balloon, and [[Incontinent Student Bodies|BAWW]]ing ensued as people thought about Falcon possibly opening the chamber and [[An Hero|jumping out]] of the balloon mid-flight, and a high-profile "missing person" search began. A few hours later, someone checked the attic of their house [[at least 100]] miles away, and found Falcon hiding in a box.

Balloon Boy sets the record for being the youngest [[IRL]] [[troll]] in existence.

Patrick the pilot brings back memories of what French soldiers sounded like during World War II... for the lulz.
