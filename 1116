{{Spoilers|Anna isn't a bot but a [[prostitute|really nice girl]], and Basshunter has been [[sodomy|very strange for her]]!!1!!1}}

Boten Anna is a [[combofag|song and music video]] by otherwise non-notable [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Tourette's Guy|Tourette's]] [[nerd]] Basshunter about hooking up with an [[IRC]] bot. It has gained a following on the [[internet]] among [[basement-dwelling]] [[geek]]s who will never experience [[sex]] that is not text based and who are afraid of real girls anyway.

At the plot [[cum|climax]] of the song it is suggested that [[16-year-old girl|Anna]] isn't a bot at all, but a real [[girl]] who wields a [[banhammer]]. This is ludicrous because everyone knows there are no girls in IRC. This is confirmed by the fact that Basshunter doesn't bother to tell her "[[tits or leave]]" (bots don't have tits, you [[furry|perverts]]) and drives off into the sunset with his laptop. 

The song was successful in spawning many shitty remixes from [[basement]] dwelling faggots and other notable [[faggots]] as well.
The most notable being "Now You're Gone". 

[[Shit|Boten Anna]] and [[Desperate|Basshunter]] are immensely popular in Scandinavia ([[Finland|Finnish]] for "home of ABBA") where shitty [[Aids|dance music]] was invented. [[Rosa Helikopter]] has even been banned under the Geneva convention but is still used on detainees in Guantanamo Bay.

Basshunter's only other notable song, [[DotA]], is a paean to the voice chat program Ventrillo.
