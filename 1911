==The Game==

''Custer's Revenge'' is a notorious [[pr0n]] game from 1982 for the [[Atari]] 2600 that helped sink the console along with [[E.T.]] and a shitty version of ''[[Pac-Man]]''. The object of the game is that, apparently, you are a [[naked]] General Custer back from [[teh]] dead,because there is no [[secks]] in [[hell]]. Basically,the game is about a Lego brick man who is getting arrows shot at him by the "revenge" Lego bitch's thousand husbands when you've finished the game there is a cutscene where the Lego bitch has a thousand babies and then the babies start humping each other,irrespective of gender. When you score enough [[man points]], you become sheriff. Whether you become a [[naked]] sheriff who gets to [[rape]] the chief is anybody's guess, but unfortunately the technology wasn't there to even show a decent [[dick]] or [[boobs]]. Even [[sick fucks]] who sit around all day watching [[hentai]] wouldn't find this [[POS]] erotic, and anyone who plays it nowadays only does so [[for the lulz]].

==The Story==

Once upon a time, back when there were [[at least 100]] [[pr0n]] games for the [[Atari]], a game company called Mystique (not to be confused with "The Feminine Mystique", [[lulz]]) decided to make an educational game that would sell more copies than ''[[Oregon Trail]]''. And, since all they could make was [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9aiVHUGwW8 things like this], a game like ''Custer's Revenge'' was considered a step up. Unfortunately, outrage came spurting like pixelated [[cum]] from Native American groups, [[feminists]], teachers, [[Christians]], and probably [[your mom]] because of the [[rape]] thing with the Injun chick. Most of the outrage, though, came from people who actually bought it expecting some decent [[fapping]] material. [[Moar]] [[lulz]]. Why anyone would think this game was erotic (though it's pretty [[lulzy]]) is anybody's guess, but because of this game and tons of others Mystique is no [[moar]] and the game is only accessible to collectors who are willing to pay hundreds on [[eBay]] for a copy, along with a dusty [[Atari]] 2600 and a really old T.V. to play it on.
