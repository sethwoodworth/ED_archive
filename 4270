Jenkem
'''Jenkem''', known by [[Fox News]] as "'''butt hash'''", is both a [[drug]] and an [[old meme]] [[Pun|turned fresh]] thanks to a [[:Image:Jenkem_Police_Report.jpg|sheriff's bulletin]] [[plagiarizing]] this very article. That is until time did its thing and made it ancient and dried up.

== JENKEM IS METHANE FUCKERS!!! ==

{{quote|I became probably the first person in America to huff his own shit gas.|pickwick}}

Jenkem is a cheap and nasty quasi-[[drug]] invented in Zambia and [[Zimbabwe]] over ten years ago and revived in the [[US]] of [[America|A]] by Pickwick of [[Totse]] and others. It remains popular among [[nigras]] and [[emo|American middle schoolers]] in general. The lyrics of ''[[Chocolate Rain]]'' refer to the practice and social effects of jenkem abuse.

==Synthesizing Jenkem==

*'''Supplies [[you]] need:'''<br>

-At least 6 months of time. Excrement. <br>
[[2girls1cup|-2 girls, 1 cup]] (waterproof container, such as a jar or soda bottle).

*'''Step 1:''' Move to Zambia and live there at for least 3 months in a slum.

*'''Step 2:''' Find the most fermented patch of fecal matter in the vicinity and scoop it out with your container.

*'''Step 3:''' Inhale until you forget you live in [[Hell|Africa]] and you start to hear your dead grandmother talking to you.

==Commercial Terms for Jenkem™==

* '''Original Zambian Butt-Shit-Gas Jenkem™''' Sometime before 1998: The first and only truly historic Jenkem™ made from the excrement of desperate Zambians before commercialization. Best and unique. Sold out. Ask your country's embassy in Zambia how to obtain a sample.

Not satisfied with [[totse#Memes|huffing Raid]], this [[13 year old boy|14 year old]] Totse member decided to get high on Jenkem, and posted pictures of the process (including him [[2girls1cup|shitting in a bottle]]) in this lengthy thread:

Recently Pickwick now famous for waking and jenking [[Bel-Air|got scared]] for his [[IRL]] reputation and claimed that he was totally playin' ya'lls! That wasn't poo, just flour, water, beer and Nutella!

[[Last Thursday]], A sheriff's report got leaked onto the [[internets]] with pictures from the Totse thread with some terms lifted from ''this very page''. This report (seen pictured right -->) spread through the [[media]] and was reported by many news outlets (see external links). As usual, [[Faux News]] did not refrain from covering it on [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,308841,00.html their site], which led to a great outburst of [[lulz]].

{{quote|...Butt Hash...|'''Fox News' Jack Miller'''}}

Hear that last bit? Fox actually thinks there's an outside chance that poopin' in a container and sniffing it could be considered illegal. Not that [[Jews|they]] want to control *everything* you think and [[fuck|do]]. Holy shit, they said fucking butthash on TV. All is now right with the world. They said, fucking BUTTHASH, on TV.

Recently, anonymous has claimed that this sheriffs report was also inspired by a lengthy copypasta posted on /b/ at 09/17/07(Mon) at 11:41:37 AM, post No.39748743:
<table style="color: #800; background-color: #fca; padding: 5px; border: 3px">
<tr><th>
</th><td>Step 1. email this to a school principal.

<pre>I am writing you anonymously because I do not want my child to get in any trouble,
but I need to alert you to something your students are doing that is potentially very
dangerous. Yesterday afternoon I came home early to find my son and his friends
getting high on something called "jenkem" which they say they heard about at school.
This "jenkem" is the most disgusting thing I've ever heard of. They urinate and defecate
in plastic bottles and leave them to ferment in the sun, then inhale the resulting gas.
I know it sounds unreal but when I came home I found my son and his friends laying
on the grass in the backyard and they were acting very strangely. There was a horrible,
putrid smell in the air. I can't believe my son would do something like this. I looked it
up on the internet and apparently this was something invented by African children that
wound up online and now kids all over the world are doing it. My son says most of his
friends at school have tried it.

This seems to be a new thing and I can't find any information about the health effects
of jenkem - I think it is the methane and ammonia content that provides the desired high,
but I don't really know. Both of those are very harmful chemicals. All sorts of diseases
are spread through fecal matter. I imagine it could lead to some very serious health
problems at your school. My wife and I are utterly shocked and talking about private
school. We have spoken to our son about this and he says he won't do it anymore, but
because it is on the internet kids all over the country are trying jenkem and they need
to be educated about the health risks. It is only a matter of time before somebody dies
from methane poisoning or this leads to a hepatitis outbreak. I don't know exactly what
you could do about this as jenkem is legal but I needed to inform you of what some of
your students are doing.</pre>

==A Trip report found on USENET==

[[Image:jenkemtattoo.jpg|thumb|right|Chaunchybigfists jenkem tattoo dedicated to his favorite past time.]]
<div style="height:200px; overflow:scroll;">
[[Cool_Story_Bro|So I was on Wikipedia the other day checking out the stuff on hallucinogens when I discovered a popular chemical in Africa called "Jenkem". After reading up on the Internet about some popular recipes, a few friends of mine decided to go and produce some of this potent hallucinogen. The first part of our journey involved a trip to the local sewage treatment plant, where we filled some empty coke bottles half-full with the potent sludge we found in the cleaning tanks.

We hid the bottles behind a bush, letting them ferment for a few hours while we went to smoke some marijuana. After about 4 hours of fermentation, we went to retrieve our putrid creations.

One at a time, we all inhaled the jenkem we had created. The odor was viscous, but my god it was worth it. What came after I cannot describe. A euphoric high, not unlike cocaine, but with strong hallucinations of times past - I saw dead relatives during my trip. It was almost magical.

The onset of jenkem is probably 10 seconds after inhalation, with the most severe hallucinations happening probably 20 minutes into the trip. Beware that if you try this wonderful substance that you're going to be "out of it" for several hours after inhaling, and really it will take several days for you to fully recover. <big>'''One of the downsides of jenkem is that you constantly have that taste of sewage in your breathing for several days after the fact.'''</big>

After subsequent trips, there were a few characteristics we felt made for better trips with Jenkem. First off, if you visited the sewage treatment plant at around mid-day on a sunny day we found we got the best highs. Secondly, make sure you have someone nearby who is not high on the substance (believe me, once you've been introduced to it, you don't want to not be high on it... so find someone who isn't big into drugs to do this).]]</div>

==An [[Erowid]] Experience==

[[Image:Jenkam needed.jpg|thumb|right|125px|This bitch needs to switch to Jenkem.]]

''Under the advice of several friends, I decided to give jenkem a try. I went down to the Lusaka sewage pond and filled my two liter coke bottle half full. Walking back to my hut I couldn't help but feel a little anxiety, but what did I have to lose right? Upon arrival I sit down and begin to flood my lungs with the sickly sweet aroma as my seven brothers looked on. In seconds my mind was filled with thoughts previously unfathomable. In an instant I saw what needed to be done to alleviate the poverty of my country and people. With the knowledge of kings laid out before me, I now know what I must do. Jenkem has brought me the enlightenment of my ancestors, and for this I am grateful.''

There probably is a way to alleviate the poverty of your country, but huffing [[shit]] is not it.

==The "Butt-Hash Res Hit"==
According to many reliable sources including Fox News, many Jenkem addicts are finding themselves in short supply of this exotic drug. As a result, users remove all clothing and assume the "69" sex position. The drug addicts take turns flatulating on each other and inhaling the methane gas. Many Jenkem addicts report this produces a more foul smelling vapor than Jenkem similar to a "resin hit" among cannabis smokers. For this reason, the act of inhaling the digestive gases is commonly referred to as a "Butt-Hash res hit." 

Furthermore, there is little to no scientific evidence to suggest huffing farts is any more harmful than huffing shit. So, huff away.

Hello:  Concerned student

I am glad that you emailed me on this topic, it has been added to our
agenda for the next school council meeting.  Jenkem has been added to
the school's police watch list, and we will investigate any reports
seriously.

Also, we have given notice to students as to the harmful effects of
this drug.  Your support is very appreciated.

If you would like to speak to me in person about this matter, I am always available at the school.
