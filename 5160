Manchild
A man child is typically an adult male who refuses to accept the responsibilities of adulthood and chooses instead to voluntarily live as if they were a [[cp|young child]].
Some times this can be the result of a serious but very lulzy mental handicap. In which case <s>it remains beyond the man baby's control </s> they are to fucking lazy to get a job. But in most cases it's caused by severe laziness in early childhood. And the parent's inability to beat the shit out of their children.
