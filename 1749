Control, alt, delete
[[Image:Keyboard-ctrl-alt-del.jpg|thumb|The joke behind this image is no longer [[funny]] or relevant, so pretend it involves [[dead babies]] or [[anal sex]] or something.]]
Three buttons on a standard-issue [[keyboard]] which, once pressed, will reset your [[PC]]. They won't do anything else and to suggest to the contrary is now considered seriously [[unfunny]] and an [[old meme]].

Control, alt, delete is considered so important to [[Windows]] (due to its constant crashing) that in the [[Special:Preferences|accessibility options]], disabled people can make it so they don't even have to press the keys at the same time. This is stupid because anyone too [[retarded]] to press 3 keys at once should not be allowed on a computer. This will allow people who don't know how to use it properly accessing the feature without holding multiple keys, such as with [[ALL CAPS]].

Pressing control, alt, delete is often the only way to shut down your browser if it has been overloaded by [[Last Measure]] or something even [[moar]] lulzy, but seriously, just turn your computer off, you fucking [[nerd]].
