Sankaku Complex
{{cleanup}}

[[image:Sankaku-Complex.png|thumb|left|Sankaku Complex]]'''''Sankaku Complex''''' is a blog focusing on Japanese visual culture and off-beat [[Lies|news]] run by a pretentious faggot, [[nobody|Artefact]]. Although little is known about the site's creator, his responses to blog comments and IRC correspondence consist mainly of [[Grammar Nazi|correcting grammar]], sporting his superior intellect, and banning people for not masturbating to the greatest website on the internet at least once a day. 

Sankaku Complex also has a forum, <s>a tag-based image board</s> shitty booru ripoff that takes forever to load, and a [[irc|multi-player notepad]].

The community of Sankaku Complex is a melting pot of sexually confused [[weeaboos]], basement dwelling [[otaku|otakus]], [[trolls]], [[pedophiles]], [[Racism|Anti]][[China|Gook/Chink]] propaganda and [[hard gay]]. Although Artefact and his fans like to pretend Sankaku Complex is an [[Fox News|informative news site]], reading about Russians cutting their penises off, fapping to galleries of Asian whores, discovering 10 things Japanese women want that [[niggercock|Sankaku Complex users will never have]], and learning about the fictional state of lolicon persecution in Japan, does not exactly keep one up-to-date on such important worldly affairs.

It's like [[Slashdot]] and [[Fox News]]. It makes Artefact a lot of money.

==Blog==
[[Image:Artefact1.jpg|thumb|The man in question.]]
The primary contributor to Sankaku Complex is Artefact who lives in Tokyo. His blog is well known throughout the internet for its [[lie|high quality articles]] concerning [http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2009/08/18/mother-daughter-gang-rape-schoolgirl/ child molestation], [http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2009/10/04/daughter-cooks-fathers-penis-in-incest-castration-murder/ dick eating], [http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2009/10/21/steamy-onsen-bathing-gallery/ copious amounts of Japanese whores], [http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2009/05/23/keroro-gunsou-cosplay-porno-due-geroro-souchou/ Battletoads porn] and other [[shit nobody cares about|low brow bullshit]]. Each article typically contains a picture of a [[loli]] being fucked, or Japanese [[jailbait]], otherwise nobody would visit the site. Artefact believes he can legitimize his mind-numbingly stupid blog by using pretentious English to convince himself he's not retard that wasted his life creating 380 pages (and counting) of tabloid journalism.

Artefact states he only cares about page views and nothing else. It's not surprising someone with such a naive philosophy would end up creating one of the worst websites on the internet.

{{Squote|Of course I only care about page views. What other measure of success is there on the web?

If he was truly honest with himself, then he should be proud that someone has written an ED entry for his website. After all, what other measure of success is there on the web?

As of October 26, 2009, registered users may vote comments on blog articles up or down. This new feature was implemented so the hivemind will become even worse, thus drowning out every dissenting voice other than the retarded animu faggots that continue to frequent the site and encouraging Artefact to spread his cancer.

'''Artefact Vs. Danny Choo'''

The picture to the right was taken sometime during December 2008 at an event hosted by Danny Choo, who runs a [[shit|superior]] website and is Artefact's arch-nemesis. Sometime during February 2009, the two bloggers fell out of equal terms with each other. Danny Choo asked people on his website to stop linking to Sankaku Complex and subsequently removed advertising and any mention of Sankaku Complex. In turn, Artefact has stopped mentioning Danny Choo in his blog. It is reported Mr. Choo has chosen to ignore all correspondence with Artefact. 

Although both of them have been mostly mum on the matter, it is likely Danny Choo decided Artefact was a fat faggot with a shitty blog that has amassed [http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2009/09/24/100000000-hits/ 100 million views] due to the sheer amount of retards from [[weeaboo|/a/]] that [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|actually believe Artefact is a skilled blogger.]] That, or Mr. Choo is normal, respectable person that does not want to be associated with child molesters.

'''A challenger appears'''

During a quiet April afternoon, a rage-filled weeaboo linked to a parody site that insulted his little hugbox, [http://sankakucomplexisshit.nfshost.com/ Sankaku Complex Is Shit].

{{Squote|I stumbled across this the other day, it seems to be some faggot's idea of a joke except it seems the joke is on him for having an even shittier site.|CheapViagra|the jokes on you|color=silver|size=360%}}

Sadly, the website is a 1 page summary of the 380 pages of spam and recycled garbage that has been produced since Sankaku Complex's creation. The most notable feature of the parody site is the perfect mirroring of Artefact's cringe-inducing writing style. Obviously, skilled usage of an English thesaurus and incorporating unconventional words into your writing will let everyone know of your educated background.

==Forums==
What happens when a bunch of sexually insecure and racially diverse weeaboos come together on a relatively unmoderated forum? Drama, hentai, pedophilia, and [[Apartheid]].

[[image:japaneseloli.jpg|thumb|[http://www.sankakucomplex.com/forums/topic.php?id=761 The last thing you fapped to.]]]
Many forum topics are devoted to the highly philosophical subject of lolicon and pedophilia. Are they same? Should lolicon be illegal? Are weeaboos actually child molestors? Many hilarious flame wars have resulted from these discussions, and one topic is not enough to contain the pedophilic tendences of [[Josef Fritzl|SanCom users]]. 
*[http://www.sankakucomplex.com/forums/topic.php?id=1142 So not everyone is a lolicon here?] 
*[http://www.sankakucomplex.com/forums/topic.php?id=1054 When you discovered Lolicon]
*[http://www.sankakucomplex.com/forums/topic.php?id=1053 Am I the only non-Lolicon?]

*[http://www.sankakucomplex.com/forums/topic.php?id=1374 Lolicons Vs. Lolicons]
*[http://www.sankakucomplex.com/forums/topic.php?id=776 Pedophilia]

Other common topics include hentai, sexual fetishes, [[Pear Chan|the last thing you fapped to]], anime/manga series, cumming on figurines, and anything else that doesn't require more than 2 brain cells rubbing together.

===Trolling===
Trolling the SanCom forums is very simple. Simply choose one of the seven options below:
*Accuse the userbase of being pedophiles
*Accuse Artefact or other forum members as being racist toward the Chinese
*Accuse them of only hating [[Xbox]] because it isn't Japanese, and tell them your [[xbox360|360]] only broke once
*Assert Danny Choo runs a superior site to Artefact
*Assert the community died as the site become more popular
*Start a topic about pedophilia or lolicon
*Post images of small children and say you fapped to this
*Link to this article

'''[http://www.sankakucomplex.com/forums/topic.php?id=956 Is dat sum racial oppression?]'''

Sankaku Complex attracts a wide variety of nationalities and colors, and being the insecure faggots that they are, it is natural to have a [[victim complex]] about your race. 

[[image:American_supremacist_fail.jpg‎|thumb|Some members do not think before they post, not realizing they are no longer anon.]]

{{Squote|It seems that the host of this forum, Artefact, is rather a racist against Chinese people. I just want to know if this is true or not.|julian0086|not sure if racist|color=silver|size=360%}}

The butthurt Chinaman then proceeded with his intellectual checkmate as the forum raged against these unfounded racial accusations.

{{Squote|You get funny stuff from china, because china is big and a lot more strange things can happen there.
Then why only china, not also india is used?
The answer is that, china is the only country being targeted.|julian0086|not also india is used?|color=silver|size=360%}}

==IRC Channel==
The IRC channel became a graveyard once Artefact became [[butthurt]] and began banning anyone that didn't continually kiss his ass, or speak highly of the best website on the internet. The topics are what you would expect from an IRC chatroom full of lifeless Japanophiles that can't stop fapping. Many [[retard|notable]] quotes can be found [http://www.sankakucomplex.com/forums/topic.php?id=472 here]. Because Artefact puts to shame every [[grammar nazi]] and [[internet tough guy]] that has ever existed, a great way to get banned is to use spelling errors while insulting him or his website.

The bot, Beako-sama, controls the room, and kicks anyone with piss poor typing and citing memes. Beako-sama is of course, a reflection of the faggot that configured her. She is known for her conversations that lead you into circles of incomprehension.

<pre><@Beako-sama> cock in me was hours ago? Very interesting.</pre>

On December 19th, 2009, users of #sankakucomplex went to Rizon staff to complain about Artefact's abuse. This action was motivated by Artefact petitioning for channel founder status, even though he was not the original founder. He succeeded, until Rizon staff de-modded entirely him after hearing a plea from a few brave souls.
