Larry Sanger
{{spoiler|[[Larry Sanger]] isn't the inventor and co-founder of Wikipedia either - [[Ben Kovitz]] is the inventor, stolen by Larry Sanger and in turn stolen by Jimbo Wales}}

[[Larry Sanger]] is the inventor and one of the founders of [[TOW]]. Dead baggage to [[Jimbo Wales|Jimbo]], Sanger is the sort of guy that Wales dreads to even mention, this most likely stems from Jimbo wanting to keep all the credit to himself.  Hell, keep it.

==Co-founder of Wikipedia (AND its sole inventor!!!111oneoneone)==
{{quote|No, this is not an indecent proposal.  It's an idea to add a little feature to Nupedia.

[[Jimbo Wales|King Jimbo XII of Wikipedia]] dreads this subject like the plague.. But we're a truth book here at [[ED]], so here we go.

Larry Sanger assisted in the creation of Wikipedia.  There are many, many sources that state that. Consequently, according to wikipedo policy, they have to use those sources. Sounds cool?

Unfortunately, Jimbo was a wee bit [[butt-hurt]] over Larry claiming - and rightfully so, as if it is on TOW, ''[[lie|it has to be true]]'' - that he co-founded Wikipedia with Jimbo. So as a result, Jimbo forced his hivemind to violate policy, set in stone and all that shit, so Jimbo's e-pen0r could grow a wee bit at [[Jimbo Wales/Chat logs]].

However, that whole story was actually a cover up of the actual truth, which is that [[Ben Kovitz]] is the actual founder of Wikipedia.  While focusing on the Larry Sanger/Jimbo Wales duel, we all forgot about the real founder. [[David Gerard]] is primarily responsible for the usurping of the true God-king.  

[[David Gerard]]'s 27 June 2004 "tweak" [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Wikipedia&diff=next&oldid=4312571 changed the whole fucking history], and sent Ben to Davey Jones's locker.  A year after David Gerard's change, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&page=Ben_Kovitz Ben Kovitz was no longer notable enough for an article on Wikipedia even].

===Proposed ban===
In response to [[Wikipedia:User_talk:Larry_Sanger#Blocked|a brief block]], during [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard#Proposed_community_ban_on_LS|a May9/09 noticeboard discussion]], Sanger [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard&action=historysubmit&diff=361022771&oldid=361022643 supported] banning himself.

==[[Wikipedia Review]]==
According to WR's admin blissyu2/Arian, [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=73 an invite was sent] prior to March 2006. Response: "''I can tell you one thing for damn sure. I certainly will never post to your forum as long as you allow [[Lir]] to be posting to it.''" + "''[[Fred Bauder]] is a crank''"

==[[Citizendium]]==
Disgruntled over Wales' petulant, conservative nature, Sanger had to take matters into his own hands.  Sanger, as a rebuttal to [[TOW]], created a superior, ''factual'' version of the Wiki, with a closed system of editing as opposed to the cesspool of non-qualified false sense of equality with which Wikipedia is so infested. The next generation of Wikipedia, or '''Wikipedia 2.0''' was to be called Citizendium. Naturally, as Citizendium will be edited solely by experts, and not [[MONGO|pretentious wikipedo fucks]], it has been estimated that Citizendium will supersede Wikipedia in usefulness pretty fucking quickly. Jimbo's response was one of panic and deep, rising hatred. He decided to erase Larry from Wikipedia as co-founder all together, and has hired a number of suits to make sure it stays that way. Internet - Srs Biz.

==FBI==
Larry Sanger has had an interest in [[pedophilia]] for nearly a decade. After he unintentionally caused [[9/11]] to occur with [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pedophilia&diff=274479&oldid=347705078 an edit], it was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&offset=20010914173544&limit=2&target=Larry+Sanger wiped from records].

Recently, in an attempt to get attentionz for his Citizendium, Sanger attempted to get [[Jimbo]] thoroughly [[V&]] for distributing [[CP]] by reporting him to the [[FBI]] . Since he apparently forgot his [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Larry_Sanger old account]'s password, he posted [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:99.67.54.40 by IP] to [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Sanger's_Message_to_the_FBI MetaWikimedia]. This posting of text immediately caused a slew of drama as people started using it as a talk page and modifying it, until eventually the entire message (and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sanger's_Message_to_the_FBI#Jan-Bart_origins resulting conversation] which we luckily recovered) was deleted and Millosh recreated the page from scratch on April 14th as a link to the prior URL. This page was referenced in slashdot prior to the creation date and the talk page was created prior to it, combined with the Jan-Bart history this wipeout is obvious.

Mere days after sending the warning, the Register broke the story, which spread across Slashdot, and Sanger twittered like made linking his followers to the various news reports.

The content in question was the "Category:Pedophilia" and related subsection "Category:[[Lolicon]]". Later, Sanger and the news articles relented that it was not showing real people but that it might qualify as 'obscene' or as a 'depiction' of abuse even if it wasn't depicting any real events or crimes. The art in question ranged from drawings of lolis in negligee from the creator of [[Wikipe-tan]] to a variety of artwork from the early 1900s.

[[File:LaSaBooks.jpg|thumb|right|Larry displays his collection of philosophical texts such as "[[Madeline]]", "[[mam|Mad About Madeline]]", "[[W|Curious George]] and the [[Puppies]] go [[fursuit|to]] a [[CP|Costume Party]]", "[[Clifford]]", "[[Katy]] [[KP|No]] [[Pocket]]", "[[Crack]] IN THE [[Track]]" and of course, "The [[velvet|Velve]][[teen]] [[Rabbit]]."]]
