Fergie Olver
'''Fergie Olver''' is the creep who hosted the [[Canadian]] television game show ''[[wikipedia:Just Like Mom|Just Like Mom]]'' from 1980 to 1985. Someone in [[2009]] would mash up the creepiest man-girl moments into a 2:23 video which went viral in April [[2010]]. Reactions towards the video range from [[concerned mother|outrage]], [[lulz|hilarity]] and [[basement dweller|trolling]].

For [[Jews|reasons still unknown]], the video gets TOS'd off of [[YouTube]] faster than Fergie bars up over the sight of a 6 year old after dark.

During his tenure as host of this program Fergie apparently rocked the Ford Windstar van spray painted with [[:File:Pedobear_22.jpg|"Free Candy"]] like there was no tomorrow. Between threatening [[loli]] with [[Smell Yo Dick|kisses]] and [[The Game|public humiliation]] he managed to brew up an alchemical mixture of creepy that remains unmatched today on broadcast television. Perhaps the most unsettling part of this [[nazi|group think]] experiment gone awry is the fact that the [[BBC|Canadian Public Broadcasting System]] allowed this walking abortion to exist for a full five years without pulling the plug.  Olver co-hosted the show with his wife.  They are now divorced.

{{Quote|The mothers are always so easy to kiss, [[facepalm|it's the kids!]]|Fergie Oliver}}

In the video we see Fergie sneak kissing an 11 year old girl, trying to bribe a girl [[do not want|who refuses to kiss him]], getting called a [[truth|dirty old man]] after the bribe fails, [[no means no|STILL trying to kiss the girl who called him dirty]], pressuring a seven year old girl into taking their relationship to the next level, and complaining when a mom kisses him after she tries to sacrifice herself for her daughter's innocence. Oh, and did we mention this was all on TV?

==The [[SNL]] spoof==
Oct 2, 2010 SNL spoofs Fergie Oliver with a skit called ''Kid Smartz''
<br>
The skit starts out like the usual Fergie Oliver game show with thet host kissing 11 year old girls but then gets a [[Davidsfarm]] vibe when the host starts getting to [[2nd_base|2nd base]] with a young male contestant. In some do black person a favor type of fashion SNL ends the skit with the only black contestant being smart enough to avoid all the pedophile host's advances and winning the show!-when we all know the smartest plan any black person would've had in that situation would have been to offer sex for money.

In addition to the array of comments the Fergie videos have received, there's also recently been a new media and blogging [[shitstorm]] on the matter. Some of them with very colorful titles like "Watch a game show host get to first base with children" and "Fergie Oliver: Did someone arrest this guy? If not, why not?".
