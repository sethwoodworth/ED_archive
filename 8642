'''You Mad''' is a meme '''<s>coined'''</s> taken from [[SOHH]] during the raids around early [[2008]].  Originated after rapper Cam'ron appeared on the Bill O Reily show in 2003 and re-popularized after a video of a [[rap|talented lyricist]] belittling his black person resulted in said compatriot assaulting our hero after he stated, "You just mad cuz I'm stylin' on you." Occasionally used when heated debate would seem to indicate that one is taking words on the internet [[Serious_business|seriously]]. In [[2009]] and into the [[2010|new decade]], You Mad/U Mad has become a lexicon of sorts for both [[Black]] people and [[Nerd]] alike as another word for being angry in general about a situation or a conflict; in essence, [[NO U]] and [[RAGE]] all in one [[Wigger|wiggerish]] term.

Milt Thompson of the Philadelphia Faillies was fired today because the team can't see shit. Thompson replied, "I ain't even mad..."[http://zozone.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/07/phillies_fire_thompson_gross_t.html]
