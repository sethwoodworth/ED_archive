'''Drama Prairie Dog''' is yet another case of an alarming trend where [[the cancer that is killing /b/]] has spread to the prostate that is [[JewTube]] [http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=2038689259 and] the colon that is [[MySpace]]. These GIFs surfaced about [[100 years ago]]. [[Some argue]] that it is from a [[Japan]]ese game show. It has since been associated as a parody for dramatic turns.

/b/tards were dismayed at the realization that the gif they had come to love and [[fap]] to showed up on [[digg]], where random [[Jews]] with computers would use their interweb powers to discover the true source of the considerably unfunny clip, and therefore reduce the effect of the mystery of such a [[meme]].
