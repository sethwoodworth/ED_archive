== Who is She? ==
[[Image:fursona.jpg|thumb|right|Her [[fursona]]]]
{{sheezyart|supersonic.muffin|Supersonic Muffin}} is a [[camwhore]] [[furry|"animal lover"]].

Let's begin with the basics:
*Supersonic Muffin started out as a [[weaboo]] [[art]]ist and is an aspiring [[camwhore]] with severe [[internet disease|lack of originality]].
*Her [[crap|"art"]] mostly comprises of shitty [[fursona|animal]] pictures and lots of rainbow colored art, because that gives her [[raver]] status.

== Pathetic Excuses for Art ==

== The "Schism" ==
Alright the Schism involves teh following people: Supersonic Muffin and Xxkilledmeagain.

'''What Xxkilledmeagain sez'''
(Taken from [http://unseelie-woman.livejournal.com/ here])
Last night one of the people I thought was a really close friend asked someone something, that I didn't want her to, since I was going to ask that person to begin with. SO once Vikki told that Britni didn't like me I myspace messaged her and this is our following convo:<br>

This is EXACT convo.  The other girl can't spell at all.

*EDitor Note: These conversations are really long and really shitty.  They are collapsed for your sanity, but should you feel the urge to REALLY understand what the fuck is going on here, you may expand them.

From: Muffin

From: In Arkansas for the next 29 days
Date: 16 Jul 2007, 08:56 PM

You know what! I asked Vikki to ask you if it would be ok if I made a sister guild to your sheezy club, that it would be close to the same but be different like an alt. dimention and she never gave me an answer. And if I'm an art thief, so are you!

From: Muffin
Date: Jul 16, 2007 9:02 PM

oh?? really how am i an art theif?? hmm?? or are you just jelious that my work is pretty much all origiomal??
i told her to tell you no. aboslutly not. that was my thing. not yours or any one elses. ... also i reported the guild. . i only ever put up with you because every one els did...

Yeah, you're an art theif! And why the fuck would I be jealous of you?! And you know, she never fucking gave me an answer, and I don't care if you reported it. You know what, if you didn't like me to begin with, why couldn't you have told me, instead of just ignored me? I trusted you. I considered you a close friend. I've defended you against people! Why couldn't you have just told me yourself? I didn't even want Vikki to ask you if you didn't like me or not, I wanted to know from you myself and I couldn't even get you to talk to me.

Date: Jul 16, 2007 9:18 PM

i didnt ask you if i was , i asked you how i was. and now you know from me.
also if she did give you an answer, you must have really not got the point
also i just thought id add a few things in from vic and chase

What the fuck are you talking about? I went invisible from every one because I gave my brother the computer to use. I'm using a compy that I can't IM from right now. so yeah, I went invisible so that I could just get back on when my brother got off. You do the same stuff with art as I do. You use references just as much as I do.

Want to know what the two were arguing about at the begining?<br>
Alright here you go:<br>
[http://clubs.sheezyart.com/Twinderland/ TWINDERRLAND (Supersonic Muffin's club on SA)] - Retarded.<br>
[http://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds/index.php?gmode=index&guild_id=47509 LIRDCER (Xxkilledmeagain's guild on GaiaOnline)]

===How many differences between the two can you spot?===
<ol>
<li>For one thing, at least Xxkilledmeagain can spell.</li>
<li>They are both slightly ripping off Romeo Juliet.</li>
<li>Xxkilledmeagain's is better written.</li>
<li>Xxkilledmeagain's also has a better story line.</li>
<li>Xxkilledmeagain's has four other races besides "earth and water" people.</li>
<li>Supersonic Muffin's between a princess and a warrior, not two royalty.</li>
<li>Supersonic Muffin's is alot shorter, and not that good, grammarically and in general.</li>
<li>Supersonic Muffin's is from a dream.</li>
</ol>

== Hi, Xxkilledmeagain here. ==

I'm the QueenofTown here on ED and here is some thing great to say: I don't have that Gaia guild anymore. Nope. In fact: I don't care about any of you. I just really want my five seconds of ED fame. Can I have it please? So, yes, that is why I post here now. Oh! And I fixed the stuffs about me. If enough people flame supersonic muffins acount on sheezy, i will post pix of my tits, but be warned they have a fungal growth around the nipple.
