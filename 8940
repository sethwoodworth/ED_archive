Web traffic
'''Web traffic''' is the key to the [[unlimited disposable income]] toward which all websites strive. The ability to generate and retain high amounts of web traffic is a direct measure of one's e-worth. 

Those with no financial motivation, such as [[blog]]gers and [[LiveJournal]] users, still try to get web traffic because it determines [[E-penis|popularity and status on the internets]]. Such [[attention whores]] and [[internet celebrities]] can sometimes leverage their e-fame into a business, but others are content with comments and pageviews.

Those seeking web traffic will do anything to get it. Propagating [[memes]], quizzes and link whoring are all fair game when it comes to generating web traffic. It is said that the internet is a rolling river of money, and one's ability to generate web traffic is like trying to catch those silver, swift fish called dollars. If someone teaches you the right formula for generating web traffic, you will eat for a lifetime.
