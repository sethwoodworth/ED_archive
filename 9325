ZOMG
zOMG is the Web 2.0 equivalent of OMG, facilitating a cross-modal, cross-user social experience. Regarded by many as just yet another acronym on the [[Internets]], it really is much [[moar]].

== General Characteristics ==
[[Some argue]] that zOMG had its origins when DepressingNerd Doe witnessed something surprising and/or schocking on one of his many internet journeys on the quest for [[porn]]. In the heat of his surprise, he missed the shift key typing a 'z' instead, making 'zomg' zOMG's earliest form. Nowadays all the cool kids write zOMG for an increased [[retarded|dramatic effect]].
While the definition of zOMG is still hotly debated, it is generally accepted that zOMG would exhibit some basic characteristics. These include:

* Seamless integration into your [[MySpace]] account
* XML support (e.g. <zOMG>[[OMFG]]</zOMG>)
* Dynamic data processing featuring the latest AJAX technologies on the [[Internets]]

== Pronunciation ==
Aside from the traditional "z-O-M-G", [[IRL]] zOMG has also been pronounced "zomg", resembling "zawmg" - just slur the letters together. If [[you]] are particularly [[cool]] you may also pronounce it as "zOh my gohd".

== ZOMG Gaia Stole This Too!==
[[Gaia Online]], staying true to its [[Special|characteristic]] [[Sheep|collective persona]], is now calling its MMORPG zOMG!, making the game's fail density [[Divide by zero|surpass all previous theorical limits]]. Of course, Gaiafags everywhere are rejoicing their [[fail|beloved, promised, great MMORPG]]'s arrival. Not surprisingly, it allows you to get gaiagolds at a much faster rate of .0000000002 golds per kill.

[[Shit nobody cares about|zOMG is based off Gaia Online. zOMG based all attacks on items call rings. These rings vary from atttack, defense, heal, and upgrade. The only way to "level up" is by going to the null chamber and "transfer" G'hi orbs to the rings.]]
