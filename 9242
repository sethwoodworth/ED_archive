'''Yaoi''' (from 私のろばの中の陰茎 'lit. Penis up my ass') (pronounced "Gay") is a [[Japanese]] term for [[homosexual]] male fan-fiction and the precursor to [[Rule 34]].  Like ''[[yuri]]'', most of the genitalia is blurred out due to Japanese censorship laws. Among amused English-speaking fans, this has led to an inside joke involving the notorious "invisible [[dick]]". In keeping with the Japanese tradition of "wet love", there's always gushes of [[semen]] after, or during, a hot sex scene.
[[Some_say|Most people believe]] that the The "[[Faggot|Uke]]" (the ones who take it up the [[ass]]) in a yaoi are just fetal dickgirls. This can be confirmed by the fact that they are all feminine whiny little cunt bitches that are just [[asking for it]]. When they grow older they will eventually grow boobs. Then they will be posted on /d/ and be shunned by society. Thus is the amazing life suckle of a [[dickgirl]]. The seme (the one who puts it in the [[ass]]) will probably be like [[WTF]]? You see gay-make-believe-men/boys don't like boobies. So they will have to look for younger and younger [[twink|fetal dickgirls]]. In this way they become [[Pedophilia|pedos]]. And that is how a pedophile is born, boys and girls.

Now that you know the terminology, let's discuss the nature of the beast. The average yaoi fantard is an insecure perv female who acts like a 16 year old girl, but is often much older. She often has an obsessive love of one or more fictional male characters, but accepts on some level that that she would never, EVER have a chance with such characters even if they were real as she is a creepy fatty. But wait! If these characters become gay, then they won't like *any* girls, so that makes her being unsuitable totally OK! The yaoi fan will then embrace her jealousy as righteousness and vehemently argue her obsession's lack of liking girls, flame any canon/fanon pairing of that character with a female, and baww endlessly about it should the character actually turn out to like/date/fuck/marry a female somewhere down the line.  

Ironically, to make most of these characters gay, fans will bastardize and warp characters into femmy, whiny, angsty characters that bear no resemblance to the original character outside of looks.  

Cases in point:
*[[Ashi moto]] loves watching two guys she can't have fuck.
*[[Snapesnogger]] loves watching two guys she can't have turn into half-serpents with male and female parts and then have one of the men get pregnant. WTF?
*[[GoddessMillenia]] is could be labeled as [[Hitler|Dur Fuhrer]] of Yaoi. Next to [[VegetaWorshipper]], of course.
*Actually, all ''[[Legacy_of_Kain|Legacy of Kain]]'' fangirls are excellent examples and completely ruined it for everyone.

== A Brief History, Warning: [[tl;dr]]==
[[Image:Yaoirape.jpg|thumb|The typical uke/seme relationship, a.k.a. [[rape]].]]
Yaoi's history can be linked to the emergence of "shounen-ai" in the 1970's, most notably by manga such as [[Shit no one cares about|''Kaze to Ki no Uta'' by Keiko Takemiya]].  "Shounen-ai" strictly refers solely to the boy-on-boy manga written during the 70's and 80's, but is often used by westerners to refer to any story that includes even a hint of homoeroticism (including hints that the Japanese don't even consider homoerotic, such as being friends or [[Ship|being drawn on the same page]]). "Doujinshi" titles were mainly introduced into the [[United States|U.S.]] and other western nations, by the emergence of "scanlation" sites run by Japanese-speaking manga-fangirls desperate for uncensored ''Dragonball Z'' comics. In more recent years, companies such as TokyoPop and Viz have begun licensing and releasing "manga" of all kinds, and in late 2004, under its "Be Beautiful" label, CPM began to release "yaoi".

== Controversy ==
[[Image:Yaoiboobs.jpg|thumb|These boobs don't approve.]]

Conflict has long existed between yaoi fans and [[Thoughts on yaoi|people who don't enjoy seeing their favorite characters bastardized by introverted fangirls]] on such sites as [http://www.fanfiction.net Fanfiction.Net] and [http://www.mediaminer.org/ Mediaminer.org]. Any drama between both factions is almost guaranteed to be found on any site where [[fanfiction]] and [[fanart]] are publicly archived. [[Twincest]] is another form of drama when it comes to yaoi, as well as ''[[Legacy of Kain]]''.

For those with little knowledge of the internets: It should be noted that hardcore yaoi and [[yuri]] are pretty much as tame as you can get with [[hentai|Japanese animation]], which shows how weird Japan is. For more information please address the [[Mr. Hands|Mr. Hands anime]] and [[12chan]]. Unlike [[loli]], yaoi contains [[Anime|favorite characters]] of [[Weeaboo|The Masses]] preforming [[Goatse|Various activities]]. Reading it Makes you part of [[Faggot|the mainstream]].

==Yaoi-Con==
[[Image:Yaoifatty.jpg|thumb|right|[http://www.bleedingcool.com/2009/09/22/yaoi-press-publisher-arrested-for-drug-operation/]This fatty yaoi-publisher was [[prison|arrested]] for selling dope.]]

Once a year, in the Bay Area of California - hereafter referred to as Fagmecca - all of the perverted fangirls and fanboys gather to get their con on at Yaoi-Con. It is a frightening place where one is never sure whether one will be either raped/molested or completely ignored by dickhead cosplayers or stuck-up fangirls/boys. The most frightening thing about it is that everyone around you is a closet pedo.

Although you have to be over 18 in order to enter the dark dens of despair that make up the Yaoi-Con, that doesn't stop people from acting like stupid fucking retarded teenagers. Mostly, though, the people who attend Yaoi-Con are married women with children who, for some reason, think boy sex is the best thing ever. Or they are married women with children who are too [[lazy]] to get a sex change and finally become the gay males they so admire. Or they are basement fags who can't afford a plane ticket to an actual factual anime convention.
