'''Zapatistas''' are the greatest [[Mexican]] [[IRL troll]] [[communist]] [[clique]] [[of all time]]. The die-hard [[leftard]] "singer" from Rage Against the Machine, Zack de la Rocha,  advertises their cause and encourages RATM fans to move to [[Mexico]] and drive trucks for them. Ironically, the [[Che Guevara]] shirts and jumpers worn by RATM fans are probably made in Mexican sweat shops. Go figure.

==History==
The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN, aka Easy-[[In Soviet Russia...|Lenin]]...[[fail|amirite?!]])  is a [[clique]] based on the teachings of the [[Noone|Emiliano Zapata]] who phailed in taking over Mexico. He [[At least 100 years ago|died]] of natural causes, inflected by bullets. 

[[90s|A long time ago]] some [[Native American|indigenous]] [[Newbie|ppls]] got [[Emo|pissed]] when [[NAFTA]] stole their land. So they began a [[anarchy|war]] asking for their [[Drug|land]] back and for [[Women|moar tacos]]. 

==Now==
These brave freedom fighters have gotten [[Iraq|a]] [[Nazi|lot]] [[Taliban|of]] [[Evildoer Korea|support]] [[Iran|from]] [[Osama Bin Laden|international]] [[Jesus|entities]].

They took control of Chiapas, a poor state in [[Mexico]], second to only [[Texas|Mini Mexico]]. The [[W|warlord]] of [[America]] tried to help their cause by giving them [[crap|New Mexico]] but not even they wanted it. 

In [[2005|January 28, 2005]] EZLN began something they called [[Shit nobody cares about|The Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle]] where the [[Luser|workers, students, farmers, teachers, employees]] and other people suffering under the [[Mexico|tyrants]] united for their [[drama|freedom]]. So far they have had [[Winnar|moderate success]].
