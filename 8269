The Money Shot
[[Image:happywoman.jpg|thumb|right|Right on the money.]]
'''The Money Shot''', also known as a facial, is a popular colloquial reference for the onanistic sexual practice of dispensing [[ejaculate]] onto usually the face of a receiving partner upon [[orgasm|climax]].

The particular term, "money shot" was coined [[at least 100 years ago]] by the American [[porn]] industry. It was derived from the fact that it was one of the most universally enjoyed sexual practices, particularly by your mom.

[[Some Argue|Critics of the money shot]] often include [[Lesbians|women's advocates]] who claim that the practice is sexually [[BAW|degrading and misogynistic]]. But, as can be reasonably expected, their opinions as well as their "consent" are entirely irrelevant. 

In recent years, money shots have enjoyed an unprecedented surge in popularity, due to both the catastrophic and hilarious failures of post-feminism, and due to support by public health officials as a viable means to prevent the spread of [[AIDS]].
