'''Carolyn Bothwell Doran''' was the former Chief Operating Officer of the [[TOW|Wikimedia Foundation]] from January to July, [[2007]], a job which entailed handling millions of dollars in donations. There was just one problem, she was a convicted felon, and a [[Internet tough guy|straight up thug]] who scared [[Danny]] into leaving the Foundation Office. ''The Register'' reported:
<blockquote>
For more than six months, beginning in January of this year, Wikipedia's <span style="color:red;">million-dollar check book was balanced by a convicted felon.</span> When Carolyn Bothwell Doran was hired as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the [[Florida]]-based Wikimedia Foundation, she had a <span style="color:red;">criminal record in three other states</span> - [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[Texas]] - and she was <span style="color:red;">still on parole for a DUI (driving under the influence of alcohol) hit and run that resulted in a [[Murder|fatality]].</span> Her record also included <span style="color:red;">convictions for passing bad checks, theft, petty larceny, additional DUIs,</span> and unlawfully <span style="color:red;">wounding her boyfriend with a gun shot to the chest</span>."
</blockquote>

So lets see, that makes:
#DUI x4
#Check Fraud
#Petty Larceny x2
#Assault with a deadly weapon
#Manslaughter
#Probation violations including leaving the country
[[A Plus|A+]], I'd still trust her. The funny thing is that there was obviously no background check performed, she had outstanding warrants, and was also in the [[Old media|Washington Post]] for [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1111760.html shooting her boyfriend], so there wasn't even a [[Google]] check done. You'd think that after [[Essjay]], [[Jimbo Wales]] would've learned something. He would remain blissfully unaware for several months. On [[420]], Carolyn sure knew how to celebrate, and she was arrested in Treasure Island, Florida for [[Alcohol|Driving under the Influence]]. [[OH SHI-]] the fourth DUI is a [[Serious business|third degree felony]], and [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolutions#July_2007 the rest is history]. Wikimedia Board Chairman [[Florence Devouard]] is trying to play it off like it was nothing, despite the fact that they are ''still'' frantically auditing everything Carolyn handled.
