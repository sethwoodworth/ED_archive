Moldova is that droopy, moldy, [[ugly]] looking piece of water-challenged country next to Romania[[image:Flag_ro.gif]]. They claim they speak "Moldovan", but that really is just Romanian with a few spelling differences, so it's just a ''dialect''. Moldova is pretty [[butthurt]] because it is the poorest country in Europe, though [[Kosovo]] is working to claim the title.
Warning:Butthurt Moldovanians will claim that Moldova existed since the middle ages. This is a illogical argument made of [[stupidity]] and [[fail]] seeing as they are reffering to Moldavia which is something entirely different.

== History ==

They could have had a piece of the Black Sea action but the Ukrainians owned them and they got denied a port city. Romania got to own Moldova during World War II, resulting in an influx of Transylvanian vampires.  Stalin and the USSR took Moldova after the war because [[Stalin]] wanted to use the [[vampires]] to spread [[communism]] and to harass people in gulags.  Incidentally, this was the height of Moldovan prosperity and proved the only thing Moldovans are good at is serving either Russians or Romanians
==Achievements==

Moldova is the only country no one has ever heard of.

== Economy ==

Moldova exports shitty wine, tobacco, and gypsum, the world's most racist mineral. They also export misery in the form of child slaves and a miasma of discontent that is vividly encountered by proponents Western Democracy.  They are probably better-known for contributing to worldwide [[meme]]ry by exporting the [[Numa numa]] song.

Their music industry is [[o rly?|slowly but surely taking off]].
Here is Moldova's number one pop star [[Sasha Bognibov]] and his hit single, [[lolwut|"I Love The Girls Of Thirteen Years Old"]]

== Famous Moldovans ==

#O-Zone, the faggy band that sang the Numa Numa song.
#[[Epic Sax Guy|Sergey Stepanov]]

that's about it.


== Jokes ==
While Moldova isn't know for its humor, the people of the country are often the butt of various jokes from their neighbors...

For example;
A father and child are in a muesuem discussing the theory of evolution when the child asks if Moldovians evolved from apes. The father reminds the child that apes evolved from Moldovians.

== Haters ==

* [[Russia]]ns and Ukrainians (same thing)

They have a troop presence on the Moldovan border. Vampire conspiracy?  I think so. Technically its been its own country for 15 years but Moldovans still don't know how to count.  

* Italians

I'd link to articles about it, but most of them are in dago, so here is a brief summary.  Italians hate the fact that Moldovans keep trying to move to [[Italy]] and make it all ghetto.  Italians believe that [[Fact|all Moldovan immigrants are criminals or prostitutes or welfare bums]], but the [[Kosovo|kosovars]] [[fail|are better at it]].  

An Italian-Moldovan shit band called Haiducii actually ripped off the [[Numa numa]] song and tried to pass it off as their own.  This demonstrates that despite Italian beliefs that Moldovans are degenerates, they actually have a lot in common with Italians.
