[[dildo|'''''Dilbert''''']] is a comic strip by [[nerd|Scott Adams]]. This strip is supposedly based off the humor of the business world. The business world isn't funny, which probably explains why Dilbert is so goddamn [[Asperger's|retarded]].

''Dilbert'' is popular among cubicle dwellers because they can identify with being a worthless wage slave at the bottom rung of the corporate ladder. Ironically, they are worthless wage slaves at the bottom rung of the corporate ladder because they waste all their time reading ''Dilbert'' instead of advancing their careers by getting shit done, taking it up the ass from superiors and helping people in senior management bury dead hookers every now and then.

==TV show==
The TV show is still about the business world, therefore it is still [[unfunny]]. Trying to cash in on the success of ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'', the show lacked the ability to make people laugh, as well as having an overly prominent musical score that sounded like it was orchestrated by a bunch of clowns with Down's Syndrome. The show's only redeeming quality was the diabolical [[troll|Dogbert]],  who fucked with Dilbert all the time and frequently used humans as guinea pigs in his cash-grabbing scams.

The show got [[fail|canceled after only 2 or 3 seasons]] and is now widely forgotten about, except by the [[faggot]]s that thought it was [[lol|funny]] in the first place.

== [[Moar]] Dilbert Strips ==

Dilbert is possibly the most [[exploitable]] comic [[ever]]. Because of the way the word bubbles are made, the guy who made the comic is pretty much screwed over.
