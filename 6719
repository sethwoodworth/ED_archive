A game created [[at least 100 years ago]], '''''Quake''''' was one of the first truly 3-dimensional first person shooter games. Created by the gods of ID Software, it has spawned many new [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|installations]] taking places in space  [[You|Players]] walk through a mundane castle and dungeon areas, encountering [[zombie]] fish, [[zombie]] dogs, [[zombie]] soldiers, and standard [[zombie]] zombies, all hellbent on [[Goatse|tearing your flesh to pieces]]. The game helped to spark a gaming revolution, which in turn created [[job|jobs]] for the [[Basement-dweller|basement-dwelling]] losers which [[Evolution|natural selection]] would normally [[pwn]] and recycle.

==Quake Storyline== 
'''The following is taken straight form the manuals from the game plus the shitty expansions, no bullshit'''

'''Quake'''

[[bullshit|The story is original and totally not the same as Doom.]] You receive a call early in the morning by your [[BDSM|commander]] to [[cum|come]] down to the base for a [[buttsecks|top secret meeting]]. He tells you shit just got real as some [[anonymous]] pussy named Quake is gonna fuck this world up and spread his [[AIDS]] through use of teleporters. [[Doom|So you step out for what ever reason and then you hear gunshots and screams and shit, so you rush in and see that the other people have been pwned and turned into zombies with guns. You make it personal and shoot these fags up and step in to a teleporter to a different world that's filled with ugly monsters who want to stick their penis in your intestines while eating out your ass.]] You have to make your way through the demension, collect erotic artifacts and at the end fight a giant vagina with tentacles. But you have to kill that pussy by waiting for a spiked ball to slide in to the vagina and then teleport inside it and find the clitoris, this is really not bullshit, your guns don't work. You have to do this. 

BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!...

'''Mission Pack 1: Scourge of Armagon'''

[[lies|In this new exciting adventure]], having had terrifying vaginal sex with Sally Struthers cooch, you come back and expect to see all the shit ok. That doesn't happen because the military has pussed out and abandon the place, they left it to the fucking bitch monsters. You see through the camera that they are coming over to beat the shit out of you. You decide if you should be [[an hero]] or grow some balls. Guess whats next? The head bitch in charge? A tall cyborg faggot with dildos named Armagon.

'''Mission Pack 2: [[Shit nobody cares about|Disolusions or Eternity of something...]]'''

It doesn't end here, you come back and these motherfuckers are still at it. So you go back to the dimension for the fucking third time and fight your way through a shit hole of monsters. Head mother cock lover, a fucking Dragon how original. Kill the dragon and leave, you should have stop fucking with this game in the beginning.

==Enemies==

Grunt - former US Marine that was zombified and wants to kill you. Easily killed and a waste of US government money. If that's the best the military has to offer, we're fucked.

Enforcer - same shit as the grunt except with lazers.

Ogre - fat ugly dude in S&M bondage with a chainsaw and grenade launcher.

Fiend - ugly shit that can eat you and a pain in the ass.

Shambler - huge ugly motherfucker that shoots electricity and wants nothing more than for you to drop the soap. Clearly a faggot in denial.

Scrag - floats like an aborted fetus and stings like a bee.

Spawn - dark color jizz that wants to get on you.

Zombie - now these assholes are a doozy. Normal zombies eat human flesh and walk around all ugh ahhh. These guys on the other hand, loves to tear off their cocks and hurl them at you. I'm dead fucking serious!

Rottweiler - dead dog

Rotfish - dead fish

Vore - some 3 legged bitch that hurls explosive homing spiked balls at you.

Knight - canned meat

Death Knight - canned meat that wants to open you up instead.

Chton - Chthulu's love child with [[NormsBarStool]], a retarded red giant that lives in lava and hurls balls at you. 

Shub-Niggurath - mother of all the monsters, basically a giant uterus. 

Gremlin - furry cute little animal from that movie. But take caution as if you expose it to water, they will multiply and go ape shit.

Centroid - scorpion with guns instead of claws. The funny thing is that it is an insect but it bleeds red.

Armagon - the final boss of the first crappy expansion.

Electric eel - has all originality has officially gone out the window?

Phantom Swordsman - yes it has!

Guardian - Egyptian warrior that is supposed to oversee the jew slaves.

Wrath - flying ghost that shoot homing spiked balls at you, seriously! What is up with this game and shooting [[Mr.Hands|spiked balls]] at you?

'''Every other enemy is a [[samefag]]'''

Mummy - zombie [[recolor]] but still a samefag

Statue - [[KKK|white knight]] who is a samefag

Hellspawn - samefag 

Multi Grenade Ogre - samefag

Lavaman - samefag

Overlord - samefag

==Multiplayer==
Simple weekend 2-player mode has been completely done away with, as ''Quake'''s then-advanced server/client system of multiplayer revolutionized the art of sitting on one's ass, while organizations such as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberathlete_Professional_League Cyberathlete Professional League] have taken the meaning of "pathetic" to levels known previously only in myth and legend. It all started with Quake 1 multiplayer and has mutated. Recently,ID software has released a free to use [[Java]] based censored version of quake 3 called quake live. Unlike all other quake games,it contains no blood or gibbs. Quake 3 [[fanboy|fanboys]] constantly bitch and [[bawww|whine]] about this in their [http://www.quakelive.com/forum/ forums]. Furthermore, the brilliant minds behind Quake Live thought it would be a good idea to charge monthly for players to be able to fully utilize Quake Live i.e. be able to create your own private server where [[circle jerk|you and your friends can play alone]]. Quake 3 source code has been released, so any noob can download Quake 3 for free, so you can use this info to troll fanboys by saying how fucking retarded they are for paying for something that they can get for free.
But Quake 1 multiplayer hasn't been totally forgotten. The Quake one community is vast yet small these days [[at least 100]] strong. Common communities such as quakeone.com host matches on their servers, only like 7 people are on.. always. The rest are late 20 to mid 30 year olds whom are die hard fans and will not accept that better games have came out in the last decade and five years.

== Other ==
Quakes are also natural disasters, ironically caused by gamers who get up from their steel-reinforced chairs in order to purchase the latest ergonomic snacktrays for their 'rig.' Despite causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in damage, these disasters are not nearly as important as the game, as made clear by [http://images.google.com/images?q=quake Google Images].
