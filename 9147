'''World War II''' (US Title: '''WWII: Electric Boogaloo'''), pronounced "World War Aye Aye", was the much anticipated sequel to the 1914 smash hit, [[World War I]]. WWII is generally acknowledged as having superior special effects to its predecessor, perhaps due to the larger budget and extended production time, but critics argue that the plot lacked the emotion and sincerity of the original. Yet everyone revered and fucking loved [[Adolf Hitler]]'s performance as the lead protagonist as being [[lulzy]], although he didn't quite kill enough [[Jews]]; [[fact|there's still way too many]].

==Release==

Although WWII was originally intended for a global release in late 1939, problems with organizing a US distributor resulted in the initial release, on September 1, 1939, being confined to Europe. This was much to the disappointment to American players who had been promised that their faction would get to be at the start of the game unlike in WWI.

Further problems developed when the US government objected to any involvement with WWII. On the other hand, public pressure to allow a US release was strong and many citizens started distributing bootleg copies. Unfortunately, since the US had not authorized them, the American faction was unplayable to all players, which gave a severe advantage to the Germans, since it unbalanced the teams. This led to a [[zerg rush|quick defeat]] for the French faction.

In the end, it wasn't until a visit from [[Japan|Japanese]] diplomats on December 7, 1941 that the US government started to give a fuck about the public pressure and finally after much torrenting the United States government, a.k.a. the owners of the entire fucking world, allowed the release of WWII; albeit in an abridged version. However, there were initial complaints the US Army portrayed too many [[emo]] [[Jews]] and used cheep and very black personlike tactics.  To keep the US in the game, developers added a new feature to the faction, in which the longer the game lasted, the more supplies America could produce, which would give the Allies an insta-level to get them to finally get to a level where they don't completly suck ass.

==Plot==


It all started because a god-like [[Australia]]n named [[Adolf Hitler]] wouldn't permit his [[gay]] [[voodoo]] priest to get a piece of the fondling action. Coincidentally, Hitler's priest was also [[Jewish]] which insulted Hitler further. After his mom died and therefore now had no way to keep his super [[secks]]y alter ego in check, then he became [[an hero]] by fucking many [[wimminz|whores]]. Upon succeeding, Hitler lived like a king for several weeks before he became a full-time [[god]] and wandered the streets looking for someone to smite. After living in an [[Orgy]] House, Hitler was eventually forced to join the Bavarian army in [[World War I]]. Things really escalated when a confirmed Jew stole Hitler's super special awesome [[weed|bowl]]. After this, Hitler learned how to commit a super epic genocide, with his new sparkling education, he realized that "YES, the Jews and [[Niggers]] are behind the horrors of the world and [[internets]]!" All of this resulted in the best idea ever: Operation Kill All the [[Jews]]. 

Immediately Hitler joined the NAZI political organization and rallied the members to burn the dreaded black person[[Jews]].

===The Rising Action: Other Countries Get Pissed===


Coincidentally, in [[Russia]], [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[cat]] had gone missing and whilst searching for his [[wimminz]], who he kept in a very shiny cage near the shack that held his [[niggers]], Stalin's father beat him on the head and violated him with a vodka [[1guy1jar|bottle]], and his most favorite-ist diamond studed dildo. This made Stalin a [[furry]] because he did so in a dog costume, and he joined [[politics|#politics]] to kill cat thieves, moochers, and the most hated creatures on the planet, the dreaded black personJew. He overtook Soviet socialism and turned it into [[Communism]].

In [[Japan]] and [[Italy]]  <STRIKE>their animals were missing too</STRIKE> they had ate all of there animals like cats and dogs and wotever the fuck them [[azns]] could get there hands on, so Japan rallied its empire against any objectors and so did the [[fascist]] Italian government. But they both suck black person balls so noone gives a fuck about that.

Pretty soon, the entire world was skanking other countries shit, which really pissed off the mimes, music hall performers, [[German]]s, scout leaders, and our god, [[Hitler]]. Then the Yu-gi-oh abridged series began giving many [[lulz]] to the good people of [[Germany]].

===A Climax Approaches: HU'MERIKUHHH! FUCK YEAH!===

[[image:KFG.jpg|thumb|right|This is how the British helped us eventually win.  Correct course of action when confronted with [[Liberals]] who compare bombings to the [[Holocaust]] is to call them [[Nazi]] sympathizers for [[epic lulz]].]]

The [[United States]] sat on its ass and ignored Hitler and the Axis powers for the [[lulz]]. Well, Germany took over any country that was near them (conquering [[France]] in a record 12 miliseconds) and then forced them to eat [[your mom]]. After taking over almost all of Europe (with the exception of Britain, and the [[gay]]s), the [[Nazis]] went for [[Africa]] to destroy the root of all [[evil]] [[h8]] and [[niggers]], the dark things that pretend to be people. Unfortunately, Germany decided to split up its Army because Hitler got impatient that he wasn't winning fast enough, but who can really blame that loveable son of a bitch.

Japan, on the other hand, was starting [[serious business]] with [[China]] and began overtaking them with their [[Furry]] [[pr0n]]. The Chinese were no match for the unstopable force that is the [[furfags]]. On the shore, they were invading islands in the Pacific Ocean, spreading the influence of their [[hentai]]. Of course, this all changed when Pearl Harbor happened and the [[American]]s got pissed off. When America entered the war, they [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|pwned fucking everyone]], their supply bonus to the Allies was the only thing that kept Britain in the fight, and stopped German [[fag]]-boat operazions.

Russia was going through its communist revolution and fucked up whoever it could. This changed when [[Hitler]] declared war on Russia, its former ally, and Russia got pissed like a sex-depraved [[furry]]bear. The Russians were [[almost raped]], because the Nazis were using 4kids, but then [[Stalin]] saw a vital flaw with 4kids's strategy. Stalin decided to fortify his defense bonuses and waited for the Russian Winter, a seasonal attribute enhancer his faction got every winter, which drained Nazi mana and HP. Stalin was able to use the Russian Winter to launch a massive counter attack.

[[Image:Hitler gets raped by Stalin on 4chan.jpg|thumb|right]]The Russians drank as much <strike>cum</Strike> [[uber]] strong vodka as they could and rose up above the ashes of Stalingrad and shouted, "IN SOVIET RUSSIA, [[Niggers|NIGGERS]] SLEEP IN SHINY CAGES!" and charged like the crazy drunken [[/b/tards]] that they are.

So then Russia charged into Nazi land, raping and pillaging in the most horrific way possible. When they got to Berlin, the Russians broke into every house they could find and [[surprise|surprised]] the German women inside, all as part of the lulziest and most epic gang bang the world had ever seen, which also happened to be full of [[win]] . When Hitler received news that the Russians were in his base, r√¶ping his wimminz, he reportedly said "[[FGSFDS]]", then summoned his Blue Eyes White Dragon. Furthermore, after he learned that Stalin had also taken away his [[iPod]], he shot himself immediately after taking a cyanide capsule, effectively committing [[emo|DOUBLE SUICIDE]]. This was the most dramatic moment in the game, and many players cried. The Russians then decided to wave their flags as they got Hammered.

===The Climax: [[George Bush|NUKULAR]] LAUNCH DETECTED===



For revenge on Pearl Harbor the U.S. employed Nigger[[Starcraft|Ghost's]] to pwn the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Due to Klan Japan being full of [[noobs]], they didn't have a single detector unit. [[GG]] Japan. As a result America could successfully drop a Roflbomb on Hiroshima resulting in death from a toxic amount of  Lolz. History records that the first atomic bomb was dropped by a Jew.

Later we would help [[Earth|them]] rebuild their [[economy]], which is founded on Canon cameras and assassinations using katanas.
When the U.S. was accused of war crimes and the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Japs, they declared "We did it for the [[lulz]]", therefore pardoning them of all charges. Then for [[fucktard]]ed reasons Japanese generals, forced our hand into atomically pwning their sloppy relatives, resulting in actual war crimes convictions.

As a retaliation, the Japanese invented anime, cartoons almost as good as [[pr0n]], which somehow lead, eventually, to the unholy creation of [[furries]]. Some claim that their retaliation was too cruel and extreme, but who cares what those pussies think?

It is a known fact today that if Pearl Harbor hadn't woken America off of its ass, we'd all be speaking German now. And we wouldn't have so many [[Goatse|cool WWII movies]]. [[GG]] Hollywood.

Also during all of this something called the "[[Holocaust]]" happened. Most people say it is a bunch of [[lies]] by the [[Jews]], who caused [[JEWS DID WTC|9/11]] and the death of the Fullmetal Alchemist. If it was true, [[nothing of value was lost]].

During the war, people couldn't get proper clothing and [[stuff|shit]], so they had to wear clothes made of old VHS [[pr0n]] clippings. Wearing these is another thing [[niggers|that got them to molest each other]] as they had very fucked up fetishes back then. Eventually, everyone got over themselves and discovered the [[internetz]]. Everyone was able to purchase [[Uranium Ore|their own nuclear arsenal from Amazon,]] and all was good with the [[world]].

==Analysis==




A decent remake of the original ''World War'', ''World War II'' simply repeats the same tired old formula: Germany invades Europe, an alliance of countries fight back on land, on the seas and in the air and eventually win. The only notable difference is the bigger body count, improved special effects, some higher tech units being on the field, and more deaths of black person[[Jews]] as they aren't people. Granted, there are some spectacular set-pieces - the [[Japanese]] attack on Pearl Harbor, the D-Day landings, the civilian rescues at Dunkirk,and the holocaust. [[The game]] did however, receive generally positive reviews for it's bigger battlefields, fixed game mechanics, and greater variety of cool new "STD Mind Fuck" weapons.

It's interesting to note that despite the increased carnage, much of the actual death-dealing is done relatively "cleanly" with explosions and bullets accounting for the majority of the casualties rather than the rotting flesh and trench foot of ''[[World War I]]''. It really does seem like they were trying to make this war more palatable to a younger and more squeamish [[faggot]] audience.

The exception to this, of course, is the [[Holocaust]], which does feature some genuinely-[[masturbation|lulzy moments]] - particularly the arrest and murder of Anne Frank - especially when they rape her with their huge [[German]] [[boner]]s.

One of the biggest disappointments about this [[war]] was its political simplicity. The [[German]] leader was [[Adolf Hitler]], a fantastic lunatic whose motivations were taking over the world and the extermination of non-[[purelily|Aryan race]][[fags]]. His unique features included a deep hatred of the vile and discusting black person[[Jews]].

The other leaders are largely forgettable, with only [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Winston Churchill]] standing out. The latter provides much of the war's comedy, with his humorous combination of Uplifting speeches, and god [[hitler]], or godler, provides a great inspirational chain of jokes making fun of his genocide skillz. However, Harry Truman's decision to use the United State's secret atomic weapons would provide for large amounts of controversy later, particularly in the Cold War.

Despite the many lulz of the game,  the game was a significant improvement over it's predecessor, especially since the balancing issues were largely rectified, a feature celebrated by all players. The game also featured new ideas, such as giving factions different bonuses to encourage players to join many factions. And while acting wasn't as good as could've been hoped, the graphic cut-scenes were beautifully done. The game inspired several gay books,  awesome gore movies, violent [[pr0n]], and even it's own actual war!
