Sparkledogs

----

'''Sparkledogs''' are the most recent and popular fad sweeping the preteen population of [[devianTART]]. They've gained their nickname from their horrendously mismatched color schemes, ridiculous hyooman hairstyles, and useless accessories so numerous you'd wonder how the fucking thing would be able to move at all (How does a dog put on headphones? [[it is a mystery|it is a *~mystery~*]]). Creators of sparkle bitches tend to get a little fucking INSANE when it comes to "[[copyright]]s" and owning every single color under the spectrum. When they aren't [[circle jerk]]ing in their little high school-esque [[clique]]s they're screaming "'''[[all caps|MINEMINEMINE DON'T STEAL TAKE THAT DOWN NOW]]!!1'''" at each other instead. 

[[Vanillakitsune|VanillaKitsune]] is their goddess and they gank her already ripped style to no end. In fact, the easiest way to identify a sparklefag is to simply judge by her front page(because all the kiddies usually associated with these atrocities are [[bisexual|bisexual 16 year-olds]]). 

NOTE: Everyone wants internet fame for coining the term Sparkledog. Since everyone is too pathetic to find another way to feel special, don't believe anyone.


==Telltale signs==

'''Does the artist:'''

'''A)''' Conceal their shitty grasp of anatomy under piles of poofy fluff?

'''B)''' Plaster annoying watermarks over art no one would have the mind to steal?

'''C)''' Have a sparkly pixelated Technicolor puppy for an icon?

'''D)''' Draw EVERYTHING AS A DOG?

'''E)''' Have a vaguely VanillaKitsune/Disney-like style?

'''F)''' Go batshitfuckingnuts whenever you use a color that was previously used on one of their characters?

'''G)''' Draw "art" that looks like it was shat all over by a spastic retarded clown?

'''H)''' Make a comic with over 9000 stereotypical wolf characters that no one gives a shit about? 

'''I)''' Act like you listen and take honest critque but really just keep drawings the same shit over and over?

'''J)''' Say that you love your haters?

'''K)''' ALL OF THE ABOVE?!

If so, it's likely that you've spotted one of these socially inept bitches around. 4 out of 5 EDiot doctors recommend dousing your eyes with some prescribed [[eyebleach]] after viewing such retina-damaging material, then proceeding to laugh at/[[troll]] these crazy kids to hell and back. Every one of them's fair game.

These blindness-inducing manifestations from the psyches of bratty 13-year-old scene [[furry|furries]] are enough to send any sane reader's head driving into the nearest brick wall. What's sad is that <s>some of these people really do have some tiny shred of talent visible in their art, they just waste it all on shiny fluffy dog art instead of going further with their abilities.</s> these kids actually think drawing this shit makes them an artist. They also can't take constructive critique worth shit - if you want to piss one of them off, that's the easiest way to do it.

It's also [[Shit nobody cares about|worth pointing out]] that most Sparkledog characters are born and die in just a single ref-sheet. Or at least this is what happens in their creator's gallery, since the sole purpose of [[At least 100|over 99%]] of these characters is getting [[blowjob|fanart]] of them. And since every Sparkledog looks anatomically the fucking [[Deformed|same]], a brilliant tactic to gets loads of attention with very little effort consists in drawing so-called "adoptables". This is, the artist draws a single doggy lineart, and colors it over nine thousand times in [[MS Paint]], with the rainbow colors and senseless marking of all their Sparklebuddies creations and adding [[Gay|wings]], [[Cock|horns]], and faggotry like that when it corresponds. 

However, keep in mind that not <i> all </i> sparkleartists are unaware of how much of a disease this trend is. Some are so knowledgeable they keep contributing to it!

===Gloomdogs===
As the name suggests, instead of [[Shitting Rainbows|shitting rainbows]] these creatures see the dark abyss that is life. They also buy their collars from [[Hot Topic]]. Admittedly, gloomdogs are not always easily distinguished from sparkledogs, as they will most likely have a rainbow-colored garment on them, [[gay|which is no surprise]].
