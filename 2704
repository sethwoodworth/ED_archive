'''Erik Ribsskog''' (born 25 July 1970), also known as '''Baron Adeler''', '''Johncons''' or '''Eric Ribswood''', is a [[batshit insane]] [[Norway|Norwegian]] blogger, currently residing in Liverpool. Since 2007, he has been telling his compelling life story on his blog (as of 2010 in [[over 9000]] blog posts; this is to be taken quite literally). Whenever he drops a fart, it gets published on the blog. Most of it is unfortunately written in [[Moonspeak|Norwegian]] and therefore has a geographically limited [[lulz]] potential. However, for those who do understand Norwegian, his blog is a continuous source of drama, lulz and BAAAWing. He also occasionally posts in English, usually when confronting the British Social Security authorities. Erik Ribsskog has become a [[cult]] figure on the [[Internets]].

==Background==
[[File:Handsome_erik_ribsskog.jpg|thumb|Erik is a handsome guy]]

Born in 1970, Ribsskog seems to have had a traumatic childhood, claiming that his parents left him when he was 9 years old. His childhood stories frequently revolve around this event. In hindsight, Ribsskog relates most of his childhood memories to a large conspiracy, which involves everyone from his family to former Norwegian prime ministers, the NWO and the Illuminati.

In spite of his difficult childhood, Ribsskog appears to have been a [[NORP|functioning member of society]] up until a certain point of his life. He has served in the Norwegian Armed Forces and saw some success in his position as a supermarket manager in one of Norway's largest supermarket franchises.

He once described his family background as "white trash".

==Mental illness==

Ribsskog's [[paranoia|mental illness]] has probably been latent ever since his [[Pedobear|horrible childhood]], but it seems that there is one special event that triggered the full-fledged psychosis that is currently exposed on his blog. One seemingly ordinary day in [[at least 100 years ago|2003]], Ribsskog overheard on his way to work that he was followed by an entity known only as the "mafian" (non-standard Norwegian for "the mafia"). Upon hearing this, Ribsskog promptly fled the country and took up residence in Sunderland where he was supposed to study Information Technology. He failed terribly at this, and has later worked for Arvato's Microsoft Product Activation Service, but left after having been subjected to their [[Work|inhumane experiments]]. 

He subsequently returned to Norway, but after surviving an alleged murder attempt at his uncle's farm in 2005, he fled to England once again and settled down in Liverpool, where he currently resides. In Liverpool, he also "overheard" that he was being used as a target-guy and "[[airplane|drone]]" by the police.

He spends his days as an unemployed, self-proclaimed asylum-seeker, bitching about how neither the English nor Norwegian authorities take his insane theories seriously. When not sending a million complaints to any and all government agencies, he applies for jobs, still firmly convinced that one day he will be employed in an executive position because of his vast experience in the [[Wal-Mart|consumer merchandise retail industry]]. He also enjoys taking [[over 9000]] pictures of himself walking the streets of Liverpool or in the same corner of his [[Basement-dweller|god-forsaken apartment]], as can be seen in this video.

==Major themes==

Major themes from Erik's blog include, but are not limited to:

===His family===
*His little sister, who is a member of the 'mafian' and the Illuminati in addition to being a witch and a communist, and who used Erik as a slave when he was a boy. The source of all evil according to Erik (despite being amazingly nice towards him and helping him out financially)
*Christell, his step-sister, who is a [[Neanderthal]]. Ribsskog is hopelessly in love with her.
*His grandmother, who was a witch and who murdered various people.
*His father, who constantly harrasses him on the phone

===Work===
*The [[Nazi|German]] company Bertelsmann, which allegedly used Erik as a slave. Erik once protested against Bertelsmann by a German war-ship in Liverpool.
*Rimi, Norway's Wal-Mart, where Erik once worked as a manager. He has reported the owner/founder of the company to the police for various crimes, including attempted murder, and believes he is involved in a vendetta against him for quitting his Rimi job.

===Life in Liverpool===
*The Landlord (T.J. Thomas/Imperial Properties). Erik refuses to pay rent (despite receiving housing allowance, which he prefers to use to buy a dozen Internet domains and candy), and since 2009 they have threatened him with eviction.[http://johncons-mirror.blogspot.com/2009/05/e-post-til-landlord-in-norwegian.html] [http://johncons-mirror.blogspot.com/2011/01/jeg-sendte-en-ny-e-post-til-council_26.html]

===Various conspiracy theories===
*Pizza Grandiosa, a Norwegian [[pizza]] brand, was a major theme for years. Erik speculates human meat is used on the pizza, and would go to great lengths to prove this.

==="His rights" and his police reports===
*Erik constantly complains of being denied "his rights" by the authorities, and has sent thousands of reports to the police in Norway and the UK, and occasionally other countries.

===Genealogy===
Erik's hobby is [[Evolution|genealogy]], and he has discovered that he is "directly after [i.e., descended from] [[Odin]]", and that his grandmother's cousin's husband was a baron (Baron Adeler). He has consequently claimed the title Baron Adeler for himself, and has applied to the Norwegian authorities to change his name to Baron Erik Løvenbalk Ribsskog-Adeler. He speculates that he is persecuted by the authorities because he is heir to the title "Baron Adeler".

His step-sister, however, is not descended from Odin, as she is a [[Neanderthal]] according to Erik's research.[http://johncons-mirror.blogspot.com/2010/05/christell-er-neanderthal.html]

===You===
Have you ever met him, been in proximity to him or eaten in the same country as him, you have to expect that he publishes everything he can find out about you on his blog, along with details of his sexual debut and opinion of your tits.

==Highlights from Erik's blog==
*Erik reports Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg to the police for conducting a vendetta against him, because his grandfather applied for a job in [[Svalbard]] in the 1950s[http://johncons-mirror.blogspot.com/2009/03/oslo-politiet.html]
*Erik reports Merseyside Police to the Oslo Police for mafia activities, and reports Youtube to the police for denying him a girlfriend[http://johncons-mirror.blogspot.com/2009/06/jeg-anmeldte-britisk-youtube-og.html]

==Quotes== 

{{Quote |I've complained to the courts in Norway, but they haven't done anything.| [[Erik Ribsskog]]}}

{{Quote |Sie ge-kören aus Aech mit der tranvestitten in der auto. [You drove from Aech with transvestites in the car]| In this letter to his uncle, Erik Ribsskog demonstrates that he is fluent in German[http://johncons-mirror.blogspot.com/2010/09/jeg-sendte-en-ny-facebook-melding-til_20.html]}}

==Writing style==

Ribsskog has developed a very distinctive style of writing. He always starts a new paragraph for each sentence. Additionally, he uses several standard phrases in any text he writes, including:

*"I think I have to say"
*"But but"
*"So that's how that is"
*"More then"
*"So we'll see what happens. (new paragraph) We'll see"

==Trolling Erik Ribsskog==

Trolling Erik Ribsskog is about as difficult as stealing candy from a child.

* Send him an e-mail claiming to represent the mafian, and that you have not forgotten him.
* Make fake subscriptions for gay magazines. [http://johncons-mirror.blogspot.com/2011/01/jeg-sendte-en-klage-til-homobladet-out.html]
* Plant strange ideas in his head, which he will subsequently process in his batshit insane mind before sending enraged complaints to the Norwegian government.[http://johncons-mirror.blogspot.com/2011/01/jeg-sendte-en-ny-e-post-angaende-mette.html]
* Address him as "Miss Erik Ribsskog" (Merseyside Police once did this, which has since served as a source of numerous conspiracy theories)  

[[Stupid|Although he is completely convinced that he is followed by the "mafian" and that this mafia wants to kill him at all costs, he posts his home address about 200 times daily on his blog.]] His address is:

Flat 3
5 Leather Lane <br />
Liverpool GB-L2 2AE <br />
Great Britain <br />
