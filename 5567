MySQL
{{More|Everything}}

'''MySQL''' is a huge [[Microsoft]] spreadsheet that people take classes for because they cant use consoles. Built for speed at the expense of getting your database corrupted. Correct usage of MySQL will result in a [[database error]]. If you cannot access [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], you should blame MySQL all the time, even if you don't understand what it is. It will make you look smart. Really (see below for [[proof]]).

==What the hell is SQL?==
* In short, SQL is a Database.
* What the hell is a Database?
**A database is an organized collection of information.
**The information can be names, phone numbers, passwords, posts between users, etc.
**For example: online communities rely heavily on databases to keep track of user login information.
**Pretty much every bit of persistent and modifiable information on a website resides in a database.
**The database not only stores this information, but organizes it, and facilitates easy searching of its entries.
*So what the hell is SQL?
**MySQL is a particular type of Database.
**Just as you can have different kinds of containers for storing items, you can have different kinds of databases for storing information.
**Every container has its own characteristics, pros and cons.
**MySQL happens to offer a lot of things that many developers like, and as a result, has become something of a standard in the web industry.
