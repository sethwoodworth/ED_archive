'''Baleet''' is what [[Special:Listadmins|these people]] will do to [[you]]r [[shit]]ty article if it is [[srsly|seriously]] lacking in the [[lulz]] department. 

The word came to existence when [[Homestarrunner|Homestar Runner]] misspelled the word 'Delete', which makes it really fucking <s>[[lame]]</s> [[awesome]].

This term is also used when a website is deleted or closed.


== Baleet this shit ==

You want to fuck and delete a page? You might [[fuck first]] then delete? Either way you should "Baleet" the shit. Except this page. This page is needed for intertards to understand this shit.
