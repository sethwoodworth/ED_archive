Formerly a popular member on [[VampireFreaks]] often who often saw himself as an [[Internet celebrity]]. He was known for his ego, lengthy vocabulary, and general arrogant behavior around VF. Rumors around the site say that Ottoid was also responsible for the accusations against and deletion of former VampireFreaks pedophile [[Ryle Garamonde]], over [[shit nobody cares about|personal drama between the two]]. Ottoid was infamously known around the site as [[Jet]]'s lapdog, and hated by many users due to his apparent hatred of [[Goth#Types of Goths|cyber goths]] and emo kids, [[irony|even though he was on a site dedicated to the two]]. It has also been said that during his time on VF, Ottoid assisted wannabe hacker [[Vampire Freaks#Chris Zewe|Zewe]] in much vandalism around the site, including the "[[script kiddie|hacking]]" of the large cults [http://vampirefreaks.com/cult/emo_hair Emo_Hair] and [http://vampirefreaks.com/cult/advice advice].


After discovering this page, Ottoid went on a baleeting spree. '''He has removed himself from VF as of January 2nd, 2010.''' as well as his fellow [[friend|trolls]].
