Unichan
[[File:Boxxy EWWWWWWW.jpg|thumb|[[My face when|>mfw I saw Unichan.]]]]
Unichan is a [[Kusaba|Kusaba x]] [[Imageboard]] in the style of [[4chan]]. Full of [[tripfag]]s and [[namefag]]s, it only has one board, /[[b/]], for Boxxy. That's right, a whole chan dedicated to Boxxy. Probably the scariest place on the internet, Unichan is where virgins who have absolutely zero chances of getting an IRL girl go to act out their OTI obsessions over a girl that they will never meet. 

It should be noted that members of Unichan actually showed up at Boxxy's house while she was still in hiding. This entire site is dedicated to destroying the privacy of a [[16 year old girl|teenage girl]]. If you are a young girl who comes across a Unichan member it is advised to call the police or otherwise [[GTFO|get the fuck out]] of there because you will surely get [[rape]]d.

== Trolling Unichan ==
[[File:The_famous_caleb.png]]

Unichan is the easiest place on the internet to troll ever, since the mods are always asleep. It is a chan whose main board /b/, does not stand for [[LOLRANDOM|random]], but stands for [[Boxxy]] instead. This place is full of [[Forever Alone|forever alone]] nerds who sit around all day talking about how perfect their Queen is. Boxxy has actually posted there a couple of times and mentions Unichan throughout her video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZrYDwLjbtE "Things are about to get intense"]. Since in Boxxy's aforementioned latest video she says that she was going to hold off going to Uni until the hate dies down (Most newfags think she meant University, this is obviously wrong since in the USA you say you go to college, even if you go to an ivy league school), users of the chan are constantly in fear that Boxxy will read their threads and never post there again if there is nothing but undying admiration on the board. '''Uninites''', as they [[gay|affectionately]] call themselves, believe that Boxxy was a character that [[Boxxy|Catherine Wayne]] created, this brings mega [[lulz]] when the truth is laid out in front of them. 

The best way to troll Unichan is to say things that would make Boxxy not want to go there such as:

*She is only in it for the [[Jew Gold|money]].
*She has a [[Dick Neck|turkey neck]].
*She is on [[Insane|prescription meds]].
*She is on [[drugs]].
*Post images or video of any other girl (The hotter the better), and watch them all [[lie]] and say how ugly she is while knowing that this is because they are afraid that Boxxy is reading.
*She should close her accounts because people from the internet are crazy and will probably rape and kill her. <br/>

'''Note:''' The last one is actually true (though that is not to say they aren't all true, because they are. These are only considered trolling techniques because it really gets them [[U MAD|mad]]), but they take it as trolling because they are self centered assholes who would rather see a teenage girl get raped than not have her post on their board

I keep hearing this term. I don't know where you clowns get the idea that people saying nice shit about Catie aren't being sincere. I totally â™¥ Catie man, and words can barely express how much, no matter how often I say it.

You guis think you're being somehow moar honest or morally superior because you say pessimistic shit, or point out obvious possibilities as if the rest of us haven't considered them. It's nothing but a bummer dude. It brings down the tone of this site, plays into the hands of trolls, and nobody's impressed. You sure as shit don't have to be a naive idiot or insincere to say something nice about Catie. She's fucking magic dude, and I ain't even close to kidding when I do.|[http://unichan2.org/b/res/152153.html#152194 She's fuckin magic dude]

|We are all in love with Boxxy here. Some day she will realize what is best for her.|Creepy as fuck
|"boxxy"

this is catie... -___- you dumbfuck >_>|[http://unichan2.org/b/res/144048.html#i144265 They think that Boxxy is a character by the way]
|OH MY GOD CATE PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT US. WE LOVE YOU. WE CAN ALL BE TOGETHER, IT WILL WORK OUT I SWEAR JUST GIVE US A CHANCE PLEEEEEEAASE!!!!|[http://unichan2.org/b/res/148487.html#148688 anonymous suggesting that Boxxy gets with every member of unichan at the same time.]
|Reiterating:

Oh you mean like in earlier videos where she was just trying too hard, and now that she is 18 and in school for performing arts she is like "Oh I'm so deep. that is just one of my many personalities I use to delight my fans".

Boxxy was her OL name, not some elaborate character she made up. Catie was just some 15 year old girl trying too hard. Now she is 18 and taking advantage of all you impressionable idiots. God you are so dumb.|[http://unichan2.org/b/res/144048.html#144356 Probably the only sensible person on the whole board]}}|color=pink}}</center>
