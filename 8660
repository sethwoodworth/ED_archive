Unbirthing
[[Image:Unbirth.gif|225px|thumb|The Japanese Government spends over &#165;1bn (or about $9.8 million) a year to research and develop new forms of sexual depravity.]]
[[Retard]]ed fantasy which is sadly not exclusive to the [[furry]] "lifestyle", in which one participant crawls into the [[vagina]] of the other, and makes base camp in the uterus.  Fucking hot. [[Some argue]] that Nirvana started this [[fetish]] in the song ''Heart-shaped Box'':
<blockquote>
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back
</blockquote>

Unbirthing is sometimes classified as a subcategory of [[voraphiles|voraphilia]], in which people are ingested by various methods (not least of which is the good old minge). May or may not involve [[vagina dentata]] or other such depravity, because hey, as long as we're pulling fetishes out of fucking nowhere, let's go wild!

Unbirthing is not to be confused with rebirthing, which is a new-age technique where a [[hippy]] [[Buddhist]] teaches you how to breathe in and out and then charges you $2000.

A well known enthusiast of unbirthing is a [[furry]] called <big><big><big>[[User:Poojawa|Poojawa]]</big></big></big>
