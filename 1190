Bros Icing Bros

'''Bros Icing Bros''' is a so-called "viral phenomenon" invented by some [[hipster|moron]] from somewhere on the East Coast. The ridiculous trend known as [[Hockey|"icing"]] was started by a website that contained videos of fucking people drinking [[beer]]. Word of this [[Retarded|hilarious]] drinking game spread like wildfire among ugly [[College|fraternity]] [[Virgin|rejects]] across the [[Dumbfuckistan|country]] despite rumors that this was all just some stupid marketing ploy aimed at said [[Neckbeard|wannabe-hipster-retards]]. Luckily for everyone in the world that has more than one brain cell, the site [[Ebaumsworld|brosicingbros.com]] has been shut down, but the [[cancer]] that is Icing lives on.

== What the Hell is Icing? ==
The rules of Icing are simple; they have to be, because everyone that plays this game lacks the ability to do addition and subtraction.
That required weapon of choice in Icing is Smirnoff Ice. Apparently, because it tastes like [[shit]] unless you were already drunk to begin with. To [[fuck|"ice"]] someone, simply give your [[Loli|unsuspecting victim]] a bottle of Smirnoff Ice and yell [[Caps Lock|"YOU JUST GOT ICED!!!"]] in the most obnoxious way possible. That person must now get on one knee and drink that bottle or else be shunned by the [[faggots|bro community]]. However, the one being iced can always [[Reverse ass rape|"ice back"]] if [[Homosexuality|for some reason]] he also had a bottle of Smirnoff Ice and now your dumb ass has to drink two Smirnoffs! [[Philosoraptor|Or is it Smirnoves...]] [[shit no one cares about|oh well, who cares?]] And lastly, if you are a complete faggot, take pictures and film the [[Rape|wonderful event]]. [[Billy Mays|But wait, there's more!]] If you seriously don't want to have sex, [[Asexual|even with other men]], go around bragging about how many people you iced today.

Basically, to call Icing a drinking [[The Game|"game"]] is a bit of an overstatement. There's about as much strategy to icing as a game of rock, paper, scissors and you don't necessarily have to do any drinking yourself unless your victim also happens to be just as much as a retard as you are.

In fact, there was a website called [[Anontalk|"brosicingbros.com"]], which [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|documented all of this faggotry]], complete with videos, photos, rules for this stupid game, and even a bro's mission statement of their ambition to spread the love of Icing all across [[America]], and by extension, go outside and steal oxygen from more intelligent people. Pretty soon, there were rumors that all of these shenanigans were actually the evil plot of the makers of Smirnoff Ice themselves. That said company, not wanting to be held responsible for this crime against humanity, denied those rumors and demanded that brosicingbros.com be [[Pwned|shut down]] for [[copyright|infringing on their trademarks]]. The day was won, but Icing still lives to this day.
