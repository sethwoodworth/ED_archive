[[Image:angry_nerd.jpg|thumb|right|You can pull that face all day, friend, it still won't make you funny.]]

'''The Angry Video Game Nerd''' (aka James ROFL or PermaVirgin or "I'm the next Orson Wells") is a [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]], [[ADD|ADD-ridden]], nerdraged, [[shit | fecalphiliac]], [[furry]] who creates Gametrailers.com videos where he "reviews" bad [[video games]] and, extending to his Youtube account, films. Instead of actually reviewing the games like a professional slapstick author (video game reviewing is [[serious business]]), he just yells infantile cusswords (about at a 12-year-old's level) at his [[television]] screen. [[13-year-old boy|You]], the viewer, find this hilarious. Most of them roughly consist of off-key utterances from some shit-eating whacked out autistic chug, e.g. [[WTF|"What the fuck!"]] [[trying too hard|"What the fuckin' fuck!!"]] [[unfunny|"What a piece of fuck!"]]. 

At the end of a review, he repeatedly [[scat|talks about topics surrounding shit]], such as how he longs for the game to be over so he could milk a bull's asshole (or his own) inside out, take a shit on a game, or simply talk about shit itself. Because really, nothing is funnier than [[Family Guy|doing the same joke over and over again]].

He also takes a swig of a [[beer]] bottle every three seconds in his videos to prove to people that he's a [[pussy|man]], when really he's only trying to wash out the taste of [[your mom|cum]] from his mouth.

[[Image:Nerd-Shirt.jpg|thumb|right|[[you|What kind of a complete anti-social, perma-virgin would actually wear this shit?]]]]

Angry Nintendo Nerd has officially changed his named to "Angry Video Game Nerd" (AVaGiNa) so he wouldn't get sued by Nintendo for making shitty shirts with his catchphrases on them, thereby [[LINK_MAH_BOIIIII|associating "Nintendo"]] with this schizoid, liberal [[Beastiality|bullfuck]] phenomenon. It should be noted that regardless of this [[stupid|legal genius]], he still has an IQ dwarfed by that of the average [[4chan]] user's left [[Ball|testicle]].

<strike>It should be noted that his actor (actor?, really?... he deserves an Oscar!), James, is actually a pretty cool guy.</strike> Anyone who acts like a person with [[Tourette's Guy|Tourrette's]] for views on [[Youtube]] [[stupid|is]] [[retarded|anything]] [[unfunny|but]].  Any of his off the cuff videos show just how little screen presence he truly possesses. He has a fat wife and loves all those old terrible monster movies that you don't give a fuck about. He also puts on this weird air of reverence for a lot of stupid old shit that he didn't really like as a child. 

==Reviews==

[[Image:Nerdrage.gif|thumb|left|It's unfunny because he's upset and it's funny to laugh at people who are upset at video games (that may be true, but he is epic fail at trying to act angry).]]

[[Image:Irapegamer.png|thumb|left|[[irate_gamer|The Angry Nintendo Nerd's Buttfucker]]]]  

Although it is true that most of the games he reviews are complete and utter horseshit, his reasons for hating them mainly boil down to him sucking capital ass at video games. It appears the Angry Nintendo Nerd (read: Fugly Famicom Faggot) has reviewed every [[old]] game that [[you]]'ve never heard of, and that his shit-related phrase count is well [[over 9000]] (to the delight of no one).

{{quote|"Q: Can I talk to you on the phone? Can I hang out with you?
A: Sorry, no."|Official AVGN website|His fans don't get it, furries only!}}

{{quote|I want to nail Roger Rabbit to the fucking cross!|[[Angry Nintendo Nerd]]}}

{{quote|You don't know shit about how fucking shitty this fucking shit is!|[[Angry Nintendo Nerd]]}}

{{quote|I'd rather fuckin' 69 a grizzly bear while shoving King Kong up my ass! I'd rather fuckin' stand in the middle of a ring of monkeys as they pelt me to death with their own anal waste!|We get it, you'd rather fuck shit-covered animals while another animal with stomach problems empties its bowels into your ear than play games.}}



It seems to be [[Unfunny|funny]] to 99% of the world when someone adds 'fuck' at the end of a word and pretends to suck at video games similar to how the [[Tourette's Guy]] pretends to suck at life which is kind of [[irony|ironic]] since both him and the ANN talk about having sex with animals.

For example, "Cockadooky Bullfuck". Now that was some major [[lulz]], [[amirite]]? How about "shitload of fuck"? Not just a load of fuck, but a ''shitload'' of it! How does he come up with this stuff?{{clear}}

==Downtime==

[[Image:GameNerd.jpg|thumb|right|Proof that the internet is [[retarded|highly educated]] for making this [[dumbass|genius]] popular.]]

Somewhen beginning of April 2007, because the [[furfag]] [[retards]] TheGameBoys account got all their [[retard|followers]] to mark all his videos as [[Furry|inappropriate]], [[YouTube]] started removing the ANN's videos obviously because he sucks a snails [[ass]] at being lulzworthy and rather ends up lookin' like an extremely annoying ADD-ridden [[13 year old|12 year old]] who can't figure out how to work a fucking joystick.

<youtube>pTUtETu09oQ</youtube>

==Gametrailers==
[[Image:Nerd34.jpg|thumb|left|Not even AVGN escapes the [[Rule 34]].]]

Because [[Viacom|Viacum]] loves hearing the word "fuck" after [[13_year_old|everything that has a pulse]], their [[sock puppet|puppet-state]] known as [http://www.gametrailers.com/ Gametrailers] decided to exclusively host his reviews. If they wind up on YouTube, <strike>it's terrible, because then ScrewAttack is losing money that they could spend on pirating full-length movies on DailyMotion with their own shitty commentary. It's only stealing if you get caught, right?</strike> The Nerd posts his [[old|older]] reviews on his personal account for those who want to relive his [[fail|glory days]]. 

It should be noted that the ANN quit his minimum wage-paying job at [[Burger King|Wendy's]] to devote the rest of his days to ANN. He was quoted by employees as saying, "I'd rather have a buffalo shove a saber laced with shit up my [[ass]] while I'm watching a [[hockey|Buffalo Sabres]] game than work this drive thru!" At which point he was told to STFU and get back to [[fellatio|sucking the manager's dick]] for his [[whore|severance pay]].

==War==
When it was announced that the old arthritic bitch (Sylvester Stallone) was making a pile of shit epilogue to the ''Rambo'' series, the [[Some argue|AVGN joked]] that the title would possibly be ''John Rambo''. Well, the joke was up his ass when the title was, in fact, ''John Rambo''. Fan [[faggotry|faggotry]] burst like a hymen under a needle and people started lulzing under the [[irony]] (even though at the end of the video, he said that he was just fucking around, making the lulz vanish instantly).

Eventually, the AVGN got tired of people who mindlessly loved him (yeah, right), and in his ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' review, he [[almost raped|raeped]] the [[Live_journal|community]] by having his [[furry]] ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' mimic the people. This naturally felt like being penetrated through the ear by Batman, so a portion of the community left his bitch-shackling nature and have taken up the cause of [[ED]]. When fans pointed this out on YouTube, Mike Matei blocked them and deleted their comments out of [[butthurt]]. [[win|And thanks to ED pointing this out, the very same review now requires approval for comments.]]

==Mike Matei==

[[Image:Nerdse.jpg|thumb|right|Matei's [[goatse|inspiration]].]]

[[Image:NerdMatei.jpg|thumb|left|A good example of Matei's [[fail|awesome]] drawing skills.]]

[[Image:Mateibunny.jpg|thumb|right|From 2 nerds 1 bunny.]]

As James Rolfe's <s>masochistic right-hand man</s> house nigger, Matei is responsible for [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|cleaning up comments]] on the JamesNintendoNerd YouTube account, drawing [[shit|pretty]] pictures of the Nerd for his videos, yelling at the [[Irate Gamer]] every other week, and [[BDSM|getting the living shit kicked out of him]] every time the AVGN does another video. So far he's had the shit kicked out of him as Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Bugs Bunny twice (simultaneously satisfying the AVGN's massive furry fetish), Michael Myers, and [[Why So Serious?|The Joker]].  

However, it is believed that Matei is biding his time and waiting for <s>the Emperor</s> the Nerd to [[Surprise_buttsecks|let his guard down]] so he may usurp him and take over his game reviewing empire. It is also believed Matei secretly keeps [[rule 34]] versions of his images with he and the Nerd in various [[buttsecks|awkward situations]].{{clear}}

==AVGN Ripoffs==

<center><youtube>xrQiFCflYqQ</youtube></center>

Just when things couldn't get any worse on [[teh]] tubes, The Angry Nintendo Nerd decided to [[raep]] the [[internets]] one fine July afternoon [[Last Thursday|exactly three months]] after [[An hero day]] [[IDIFTL|(For the lulz?)]]. The result of this [[raep]] was the first ever bastard child of the [[internets]], rightly dubbed as "ANN ripoff #1". When this bastard child was able to grow a [[penis]] several weeks later, he then preceded to [[rape]] the [[internets]] in a fashion that would make a samurai become [[an hero]]. 

As the [[internets]] got [[AIDS]] by all of the raping of it by [[YouTube]], the ANN ripoffs then decided to have incest and [[fuck]] each other to express their sexual lust for the bad games that they "review". Hence, the ANN ripoff population has grown to a level that's [[over 9,000]].

This devious process has gone unchecked by [[YouTube]], as the [[whore|admins]] are too busy [[fap|stroking]] it to all those [[16_year_old|underage girls]] making out on [[camwhore|webcams]]... that, or they're all from [[Australia|West Virginia]].

The AVGN Ripoffs have pissed off the [[internets]]. All hell has broken loose as the merchant from ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'''s power level goes [[over 9,000]] and takes his [[flounce|anger]] out on an 80s CD player:

===[[Irate Gamer|The Irate Gamer]]===

Tries to buttrape the ANN concept with his NES he got 2 days ago, and by being [[fat|overweight]] (FUCKING FATTY).

===[[Alexander4488]]===
[[Image:Alex4488lol.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander4488: The long lost son of [[Cockmongler]]]]
A [[Plagiarism|"nerd-spired"]] [[leech|game reviewer]] who is less known for his [[Pathetic|appallingly bad]] game reviews and more known for his [[Autofellatio|self-fellating]] [[Shameless self-promotion|advertisements on every gaming website known to man]]. Like another egotistical game reviewers, he goes to film school and [[unwarranted self-importance|fancies himself as the second-coming of the AVGN on YouTube]].

His blatant egotism came to head as a group named [[Let's Play with YouTube|FilmsForFustilarians]] [[MST3K|riffed]] on [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysqPqiF71Mo one of his videos]. Being absolutely [[batshit insane]], he came to his own defense in a barrage of video comments [http://www.youtube.com/comment_servlet?all_comments&v=ysqPqiF71Mo&fromurl=/watch%3Fv%3DysqPqiF71Mo where they actually outnumber the number of views the video has]. Safe to say, his sheer butthurt generated great lulz for those who witnessed it.

On cue, Alexander has [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/User:Gamedude8888 made] [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/User:Alexander448 multiple] [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/User:Mysterydude accounts] on ED after this stub was written in an effort to [[lol wut|defend his actions]].

===Furious Famicom Faggot===

[[Image:XmasNerd.jpg|thumb|right|BRB, not being funny.]]



[[Something Awful]] has been [[unfunny|lulzless]] for quite a while (despite the claims of the Goons that the site is lulzier than ever...fucking liars, they are!). Despite this, they had their hands on a gold mine of [[lulz]] and [[drama]] that was yearning to be untapped.

The Furious Famicom [[Faggot]], created by [[Shmorky]], was to be a parody that would [[pwn]] the Angry Nintendo Nerd and all of those retreads that he inspired. Unfortunately, SA fucked it up ([[typical|as usual]]) and FFF became nothing more than another epic [[fail]] and a [[lulz]] flop that could have been so much moar had SA not been involved. This is in part because the FFF was created as a parody on both the Angry Video Game Nerd and a lesser known [[fail]] called ''[http://www.gamelifeshow.com/ Gamelife]''. The other part being that Shmorky [[facepalm|consistently]] draws his [[Dane Cook|"comedy"]] from the black holes of unfunny that are his own damaged brain and [[Lowtax]]. As an [[Anonymous|unnamed]] lulzosopher put it, "FFF is like the carrot cake of video game reviewers; it is decent when first eaten, but [[Goatse|quickly becomes sickening]] and made of all things [[fail]]." 

Fortunately, the [[internets]] saved itself from certain [[raep]]ing by giving FFF the [[AIDS]] and [[fail]] before it became too lulzless [[asking for it|for its own good]]. We can only drink to the lost potential of [[lulz]] and [[win]]...

A few weeks after the [[fail]] that was the Furious Famicom Faggot, Ebeeto emerged from the shadows as another parody of the [[YouTube]] video game reviewing movement, however, he is moar of a parody of that [[Unfunny|lulzless]] fuck UrinatingTree, instead of the AVGN.

=== [[LeisureSuitGaming|LeisureSuitGaming / Silent Rob]] ===
[[File:SilentWank.gif|thumb|250px|Right|Silent Rob]]
AKA The Ginger Whinger, Silent Rob is a [[hardcore]] [[ITG|internets tough guy]] who is more known nowadays for his [[BAWWW|whiny emo diatribes]] than his [[fuck|"fuck"-fests]] in disguise as video game reviews. He got his start as an [[unfunny|extremely overrated]] game "reviewer" best known for his Action 52 review, which was, shockingly, worse than the game was in all aspects. But after sucking Damien Estreich's cock enough to merit [[The Kewl Kids|YouTube Partnership and the featuring of his videos on the main page]], Mr. Estrech refused to give it to him, deeming his [[shit|work]] [[truth|unoriginal]]. 

This is when Silent Rob [[butthurt|busted down the floodgates]] and spent ten minutes bitching about the [[Irate Gamer]], in which his arguments, for every small truth they may have had, were cockblocked by at least fifteen references to IG "[[blowjob|loving the cock]]" per truth. His [[fanboy|fanbase]], being as intelligent as [[lemmings]], followed his orders and started hating the reviewer, spawning a great, yet pathetic, amount of [[lulz|proxy lulz]] that still lingers to this day.

Rob has still not gotten over the butthurt of not becoming a YouTube Partner. Seeing the likes of the [[AVGN]], [[That Guy With The Glasses]], and [[Yahtzee]] [[Internet poor|making money hands over fists]], he has since gotten into [[internet panhandling]] by [[Geocities|creating his own website]] devoted to his poorly-made, unfunny [[abortion|abortions]] that he calls videos. 

But [[Snape kills Dumbledore|this story has a twist]]: [[facepalm|He charges people $5 just to visit it]]. He has rightfully suffered backlash from his [[13-year-old|loyal followers]], finally seeing how shitty his work really is. The ensuing lulz that has resulted from Silent Rob's butthurt and subsequent bawwwing about the website can be best described as [http://www.slutload.com/watch/qhd0qSMDcWG/Game-reviewer-jerking-off.html# the funniest thing that man has ever done.]

<youtube>ZKgSF0BNFrU</youtube>

This horrid blob monster is trying to be the Angry Nintendo Nerd, but the difference is that this fat fuck is WAAAAAYYY moar fuckin' funnier in a completely different way. Just look at him, seriously, the video explains it all.

==The Mischief Makers Incident==
In one AVGN video he is seen giving his angry look at a ''Mischief Makers'' cartridge. This caused rage on /v/ as they thought he had or was going to make a review video for ''Mischief Makers''. It turned out that it was just filler footage for an intro and /v/ trolled themselves into thinking otherwise as the AVGN has not stated that he intends to review the game.

==Suspension==
[[Last_thursday|Last week]] YouTube suspended the AVGN account. No reason was given, but lots of lulz and BAWWing were seen among the AVGN fanboys. This later turned out to be the result of Game Trailers' own incompetence. [[Epic Fail|Apparently, Game Trailers was too stupid to figure out that the one posting the Angry Video Game Nerd videos was, in fact the AVGN himself and made copyright complaints.]]

==AVGN Nazis==

[[Image:Palestinian-vs-tank.jpg|thumb|right|Prisonbreak72020 tries to take on ED.]]

In the warzone that is the YouTube, Video Game Reviewers and their rivals have spawned many 12 year old jihadists who would otherwise be vandalizing ED, 4chan or other mean people who make fun of their idols.

* '''Prisonbreak72020''': Vandal and anticipated [[an hero]]. Feel free to leave him a message on his latest ED account [[user:TheWTFHero]], <del>or his new YouTube account [http://www.youtube.com/MAXPAYNEPRODUCTIONS MAXPAYNEPRODUCTIONS]</del> account [[deleted|closed]]. Ironically is also a [[Irate Gamer]] Nazi. Probably not an epic double agent. Thinks he's black, even though the picture of his mug is shown at the top of his own article. 

* '''greatexpectations320''': Once a minor [[fantard|fanboy]] who evolved into the unholy avatar of the [[lulzkiller]] and [[meme]] smasher.  

* '''Chickenhed61''': An AVGN house black person and pedophilic [[furfag]] who enjoys masturbating to videos of kittens and [[13-year old boys]].

Of course dedicating yourself to defend [[13 year old|12 year old]] YouTube users with unfunny game reviews from these people makes you one with the [[AIDS]].

==[[A challenger appears]]==
As of recently, a movie reviewer by the name of the [[That Guy With The Glasses|Nostalgic Critic]] challenged the [[Transvestite| tyranny]] of the [[Wikipedia| Angry Video Game Nerd on the internet]]. The war was started by the Nerd's Nazis in an attempt [[Leave Bond to me|to take out the competition]] by saying that the Nostalgic Critic was an AVGN-ripoff. This is far from the truth, for the [[lie|Nostalgic Critic is funny]]. [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/161-angry-video-game-nerd-rant NC decided] to fight-back, only to [[Nerd Rage|piss off the AVGN]].

==2010: James Rolfe Jumps The Shit Shark While Letting Slip Some Diarrhea==
Beginning in spring 2010, [[lazy|Rolfe began doing AVGN videos once per month instead of once every two weeks]] (supposedly to promote his other "nobody-gives-a-shit" series: <s>Boring Lame</s> Board James), and in spite of doubling his per-video production time [[fail|there was no noticeable improvement in quality]]. Judging by [[shit|his reviews of Cheetahmen and Zelda II, along with his piece on game glitches]], he is fast approaching the [[Irate Gamer]]'s trademark variety of [[unfunny|lulzlessness]].  And instead of AVGN videos, [[shit nobody cares about|James Rolfe is incessantly shitting viewers with photo evidence that he visited the filming locations of B-list horror movies.]]

As if that weren't enough of a diarrhea dump for his viewers to have to endure, he's been uploading shitty vlogs from E3 and Comic-Con, proving that without a script Rolfe is [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|near-inarticulate]]. In addition he sporadically uploads video reviews of pre-1990s movies which, conveniently, [[lazy|he has stopped indexing under "Movie Reviews"]], forcing fans to work backwards through <s>Shittymassacre</s> Cinemassacre blog archives just to figure out what he's done over the past few months.

Other recent [[sarcasm|highlights]] on Rolfe's website Cinemassacre indicate that he's going in the same direction as [[Spoony]]: becoming increasingly vlog-centric, inconsistent, and [[USI|self-aggrandizing]] in his overall content. These highlights include:
* A look-back at all the <s>trash</s> concert ticket stubs he's collected, which basically amounted to [[faggot|Rob Zombie]], [[Korn]], [[emo|Rob Zombie]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[13 year old|Rob Zombie]], and other 1990s [[radio|mainstream]] [[emo]] [[fag]]-rock that most people stopped liking as soon as they surpassed the age of 14.
* [[douchebag|Appeals to his international audience to spam the online ballot box in a Philadelphia-based videographer competition, in which he is competing against small, local wedding photography studios.]]
* Indie horror videos in which he [[wut|plays a character based off of James Rolfe]] [[South Park|...poorly]].
* Original videos where he dresses up like a [[13 year old boy]] (Boring Lame... er, Board James) and talks about his favorite board games that he used to play by himself growing up.
* A five part video series where he reads some shitty paperback tie-in book for ''[[Mega Man]] II'' with all the range and emotion of [[The Matrix|Keanu Reeves]].
* Top-ten movie lists of increasingly obscure and smelly subject nature. [[No|Top 10 William Shatner movies, anyone?]]
* His home videos when he was a little boy, that according to him, are part of his "filmography".
* A Christmas [[lie|'review']] that consisted of him [[shit|replacing the words to How the Grinch Stole Christmas]] and [[lazy|<i>nothing else</i>]]

===Update===
<strike>Despite a lulzless start of the year, Rolfe has produced some quality material in later months.  Perhaps realizing that his angry shtick has been relentlessly copied by virtually every [[video game reviewers|internet reviewer]], Rolfe's later reviews have been low-key, where he calmly states that he would rather eat a diarrheal vomit smoothie than play a given game, without raising his voice or making a diarrheal face at the camera, which is unsurprisingly a preferable MO.  So far, it is working out.</strike>

Since [[last tuesday]] he has further confirmed his status as a [[internet celebrity]] on the decline by doing nothing but spewing

Not so long ago asalieri made a valid video describing in detail the problems of AVGN and the result was a bunch of butthurt screwattack fans. In the video he compared two reviewers clanofthegraywold and the guy that sucks monkey fuck. The video was taken down twice (by Mike Mattei). Watch and you’ll see why AVGN fans would rather eat out the asshole of a road kill skunk than watch this video.
