Moveable Type
Chafing [[blog | blogging]] software from [[Six Apart]], primarily used for independent sites.  It is used by many people who ride on [[the Virginmobile]]. 

Moveable Type's primary selling point is that its free to individuals and appeals to the cheap bastards on the Internet, usually teenagers. It is, however, fairly limited in this form and prone to comment [[spam]], which can drive people to madness. [[LJ Drama]] was originally run using Movable Type, and older posts were filled with advertisements for [[penis]] pills and other useless shit. Savvier bloggers have moved onto other software at this point.

The [[GNAA]] has managed to crapflood many MT blogs, subverting all combinations of securty implemented by the Six Apart team, including captchas, ip-bans, and time limits on posting. And all this was done using only [[Python]]!
