A [[Womanizer]] is someone who changes men into women.  [[Feminist]]s are often womanizers, but [[men]], if rarely, can also be womanizers. 

== Who are womanized? ==
Men who have been turned into woman, whether artificially, by [[magic]], or feminist literature.  The womanized population of any country is comparatively low, but studies have shown that the number of womanized people is growing steadily, and that [[straight]] [[white]] [[male]]s are [[America]]'s fastest growing womanized demographic.

Womanizers generally can't get laid [[IRL]] and will resort to having [[cybersex]] with other womanizers who are pretending to be [[women]], or with [[ugly]] actual women, in exchange for money.  This [[porn]] sub-type is consumed in great quantities by men who want to be womanized, and by women who wish they were once men.
