'''WpCyberstalking''' (http://lists.wikia.com/mailman/listinfo/wpcyberstalking, aka '''secret mailing list''') is a [[Angela Beesley|Wiki[medi]a]] Mailman mailing list created by [[bureaucratic fuck|wikipedant]]s to discuss the [[shit nobody cares about|grave]] problem of TOW's outgroup googling ([[Wikipedese|en-x-tow]]: "[[attack|stalk]]ing") [[essjay|assjack]], [[katefan0|demokratefan1]], [[Scheißjüdin]] & [[the Wikipedia Jews|Co]].

==Prelude to the drama==
In November 2007, [[bureaucratic fuck|wikipedant]] [[Durova|Lice Brewer]] attended an [[Carr-Benkler wager|Internet-utopian]] [[Web 2.0|seminar]] in Jew York to represent TOW. She was interviewed on video by a guy who later published said video on JewTube. On the video, Lice Brewer complained about [[WikiScanner|imagined threats to TOW coming from the outside]]. Lice Brewer's petty, disgruntled demeanor on the video was then made fun of by [[The Wikipedia Review]]. Given her pettiness, reductionism and perfectionism instead of optimality, which is also typical of Wikimediots in general, The Wikipedia Review's sarcasm got under her skin. Around the same period of time, The Wikipedia Review's poster Jon Awbrey was flooding TOW with sockpuppets, so this fueled Lice Brewer's imagination about sockpuppets coming from The Wikipedia Review.

==Banning of Bang-Bang==
Following her motif of imagined outside threats to TOW, Lice Brewer imagined that Bang-Bang (!!), a contributor to the did-you-know section of TOW's home page, was an intruder coming to TOW from The Wikipedia Review, so Lice Brewer proceeded to ban Bang-Bang without prior discussion. So she then explained her banning of Bang-Bang on an e-mail message to a fellow TOW administrator, but on that e-mail message she also mentioned the WpCyberstalking mailing list, which at the time was relatively hidden (not really secret) from TOW's outgroup. The recipient of the e-mail message then [[copypasta|copied and pasted]] the e-mail message onto a TOW page, and The Wikipedia Review got wind of WpCyberstalking, so then the whole drama unfolded.

==The Register stirring the TOW pot once again==
Thereafter, this whole drama about Lice Brewer and WpCyberstalking was mentioned by Andrew Orlowski's Register colleague Cade Metz on [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/12/04/wikipedia_secret_mailing/ a typical Register anti-TOW piece]. This Metz piece was then discussed on a Slashdot thread. Since Slashdot users are big ass-kissers of TOW, they detest Orlowskian anti-Wikipedia criticism, and so they started [http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/04/0333252 yet another lenghty discussion on the topic]. This news then made it to Irish computing news Web site siliconrepublic.com and to several blogs. As is typical of the TOW mailing list, anti-lulzy discussions ensued over there also.

==GOOG bottom line==
This all comes at the time of TOW's late-year 2007 fundraiser for the benefit of [[the child in Africa]] (CIA), when the fundraiser is falling short of TOW's and Madame Wikiwiki's supposed [[unrealistic expectations|expectation]]s:

[[the child in Africa|CIA]]-[[Google|GOOG]]-[[Wikia|TOW]] algorithm:
#Start a fundraiser for the child in Africa (CIA).
#Set up a blog to make it clear you emphasized the CIA fundraiser to the outgroup.
#Let the Lice Brewer scandal undermine the CIA fundraiser.
#Watch how the CIA fundraiser falls short of Madame Wikiwiki's expectations.
#Use the shortcoming of the CIA fundraiser as a pretext to embed Google AdSense in TOW's pages.
#[[????|????]]
#[[Profit]]!
