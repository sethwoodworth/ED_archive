TGcomix
:{{eduser|Rizden}}
[[Image:KeepDreamingTG.jpg|thumb|How TG sees himself. He might as well keep dreaming.]]
'''TGcomix''' is, for all intents and purposes, a [[Pedophile|pedocunt]]. He spends his days posting his shitty [[lolicon]] artwork and [[nobody gives a shit|standing up for his rights]]. Despite claiming that he would leave DA because of it's [[Incontinent Student Bodies|unfair censorship]], TGcomix just can't stand leaving his non-existent fanbase from DeviantART. Doing so, he constantly ban evades despite complaining about the mods and other users that "[[Narcissism|don't give him the respect he deserves]]". This dear boy suffers from a case of [[Unwarranted Self Importance|U.S.I]] and thus has set out on a crusade to defend [[DeviantArt]] from the tyranny and unjust censorship of the [[mod]]s!!

==Once Upon a Time...==
[[Image:NiceFaceThere.jpg|thumb|TGcomix shows us his knowledge in facial structure.]]

TGcomix is yet another pedophile who thinks he [[No|possesses some form of talent]]. Since TGcomix thinks that he is a [[Burger King|king]] and that the internet is his throne, he suddenly got the idea that every single thing he touches turns into gold. Of course, since TGcomix can't attract real women, the only way that he can get over being a lonely [[faggot]] is to draw-you guessed it, [[lolicon]]. And what's better than lolicon than panty shots of said lolis? Spanking them would be the answer! TG has many [[Fandom|obsessions]], one of them being young girls with horribly unrealistic anatomical features being spanked by [[Dyke|older women]]. He considers these to be "professionally" made games even though they only consist of two frames and are made with a shitty FLASH imitator.

[[Image:Egame2.jpg|thumb|One of TG's [[shit|shitty]] [[animu]] [[game]]s. And this [[sick fuck]] believes he's some kind of [[faggot|artistic genius]].]]

Besides being a pedophile, TGcomix is also infamous for acting like a total cunt to people who thinks his gallery is filled with loli. In that case, TGcomix would also hate the [[truth]], since he is too fucking stupid to realize that people are actually smart enough to tell when pedophilia is present. When people do find his gallery to be repelling, there will eventually be a comment pointing out the loli in his gallery. The comment will start off as [[Troll|reasonable]]; however, TGcomix will take comments [[Trying too hard|too seriously]] and will always reply in a blatantly [[Rage|angry]] way. Because TGcomix gets extremely butthurt over comments that don't agree with his viewpoint, TGcomix will pull a failed attempt at looking badass. By "looking badass" he would pretty much use the vocabulary of an angry twelve-year-old with down syndrome and would throw shit rebuttals. Certain ways he shows his autism is using caps-locks, the words "reeking asshole" and other words commonly used by [[Shotacon|young boys]] who can't come up with intelligible words.

{{squote|Being too much of a butthurt crybaby to admit their obvious defeat, they create a small army of sock-puppets to take revenge on their opponent.|Can YOU spot the irony?}}

TG is also well-known to include [[Fail|statements in his arguments that reflect more onto him than the person he debates with]]. Since he is too concentrated on [[Almost raped|owning]] his target, he will always assume that he has done [[Molestation|nothing]] [[Rage|wrong]] and that people that oppose him are always wrong. In other words, TG thinks that others did actions that he is guilty of. The truth is that he has created a number of sock puppets simply because he was too butthurt over getting banned from [[4chan]], [[DeviantART]], [[JewTube]] and, of course, [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].

==The war with [[DeviantART]] and Censorship==
[[Image:Tgc0mix.jpg|thumb|TGComix's dA [[faggotry]] in a nutshell]]

It all started when TG was craving attention for his vast amount of pictures depicting young girls who voluntarily takes off their [[Weeaboo|kawaii pantsu]] for creepy old men. Because everybody knows that if you draw [[Animu|moe]] characters with unrealistic anatomy, you can guarantee some notoriety, right? Of course, the notoriety he has received didn't [[Just as planned|go as planned]]. Instead of people hailing him as a great god for his [[Shitty art|vast talents]], his submission of [[Flash|suggestive pictures]] only lead to people accusing him of pedophilia and reporting his pictures.

When his deviations do get deleted, he will blame everything on the people who finds pedophilia to be abhorrent, since [[Common Sense|logically]], everyone is a suspect when they disagree, right? TGcomix will tolerate none of this anti-pedophile injustice, and has posted an [[masturbation|egocentric]] rant over the [[bullshit| censorship of pedophile erotica]]. All of his arguments looks as if they were typed by someone who has a [[Divide by zero|malfunctioning]] caps lock button and the cussing of a retarded [[pirate]]. Because if your argument is 100% bullshit then that automatically means that you have won your debate. Of course, thinking that he is [[Mary Sue|right in every way]], he stated on his Hentai-Foundry that he was banned from DeviantART for "stating the truth". The irony behind that statement is that he stated multiple times on his deviations that his characters were over eighteen, ''yet'' his gallery on Hentai-Foundry is literally filled with lolicon and even [[:Image:Notapedocunt.png|admitted it on his userpage]] (which was eventually erased).

Besides his [[Internet Tough Guy|great war against the evil online censorship]], TG is also a white knight of [[MaruMariMaru]]. Since he believes that EVERYTHING is an art form, [[Lol|even if a person didn't actually make it]]. If someone just so happens to not kiss her feet for her ''hard'' work, he will declare them as a [[Irony|talentless prick]] who is merely jealous of Maru's popularity. This shows how TG is truly retarded, because saying shit like that ''contradicts'' his views on art.

However, the great Maru Defense Force is a weak one-man army facing against a whole club against tracing, best known as the Anti-Editing Club. TGcomix, being an internet tough guy, declared war on them. Many of his bullshit claims against them is that their reasons to protest against Maru's tracing consists of [[O RLY?|vague arguments]]. But really doesn't take a genius to tell if her artworks are traced. Ironically, TG shows no proof of the club being jealous, [[Never|Maru being talented]] and his ban for telling the truth. You really have to [[Bill Nye|consider the following]]; why would deviantART ban someone who harassed others, ban evade and upload child pornography [[I DUNNO LOL|for such a vague reason]]?

==Encyclopedia Dramatica==

TGcomix has signed up for more than just the sex offender registry. He joined Encyclopedia Dramatica not once, not twice, but THREE times. His first known user was '''Krazypyro77'''. He used it to fag up the [[AnonIB]] article and, of course, failed.

===As Crim2===
[[Image:CrimvsCrim2.jpg|thumb|TG's excellent vandalism skills.]]

What made TG HAET Encyclopedia Dramatica was when he made his second sockpuppet, Crim2.  During this time, TG was known as ChanceBlackTown and was fighting a mighty war with the Anti-Editing-Club to save his beloved [[MaruMariMaru]]. After noticing that he had his own article, he registered as '''Crim2''' to trick EDitors into thinking he was a sockpuppet of the author '''Crim'''.

[[Fail|TG made yet another mistake]], unfortunately. When it comes to editing Encyclopedia Dramatica, one can simply call him “[[Dumbass|misinformed]]”. The only experience he had with wiki format is cheap poorly-made [[wikia]]s, and lord knows that migrating from there to ED will not end so well. Editing Encyclopedia Dramatica requires a certain writing skill that contains vast amount of lulz and hilarity. TG can’t do either. TGcomix, himself, has admitted that he has never even read [[ED:101]], an important [[Fiction|Bible]] of ED. But don’t forget, this is the same man who thinks he is a genius. Therefore, like his art, his articles are absolutely unbearable to look at.

{{squote|Hi. I'm an extremely butthurt ED user who was permabanned for posting incredibly unfunny crap.|TGcomix sucking up to an [[Illogicopedia]] SysOp.[http://www.illogicopedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Silent_Penguin#A_Message_from_Unfunny_.26_Butthurt_Ltd]}}

After thinking that he was [[Aquaman|unstoppable after a few edits]], TG's first target on ED was Crim for adding him into Maru's article. Although Crim's identity is [[Not Gay|ambiguous]], TG labels him as a dirty Anti-Editing Club member and a person who is jealous of Maru's [[Shit|amazing tracing skills]]. This then led to Crim creating an article on TGcomix, or known as black person. The article was already in bad shape when it was first created, however TG soon discovered it and was obviously pissed off because Crim just can't kiss his feet. Still cloaking himself as Crim, he made an article on The Anti-Editing Club. 

[[Image:TGBegs.png|thumb|Crim2's last two edits.]]
But this didn't go unnoticed for too long. Although some SysOps have left messages to him, he [[Cunt|deleted them from his talk page to make it look as if he didn't do anything wrong]]. Eventually, ''[[Zaiger]]'' saw his [[shit]]storm and [[Delete Fucking Everything|deleted it all]] to stop its aids from infecting other potential articles. Because he threatened to delete them, TG was down on his knees begging him to allow his bitchings to continue. TG eventually made an agreement to [[Impossible|improve his articles]] hoping that they would stay for his entertainment only. Unfortunately, since he couldn't save his own article, he was banned and left with shame.

===Teaming up with Carbide20===
{{Main|Failcyclopedia}}
[[Image:Hateline.PNG|thumb|left|TG reveals that he is one of [[Retard|those people]] who just can't operate a normal wiki.]]
It is without a doubt that TG's butthurt has quadrupled after that. He later found his next [[love]]r, Carbide20, the creator of the infamous [[Failcyclopedia]]. It is not surprising that he would fit in well with the other rejects by complaining about the mods and thinking they were superior. In fact, he was even [[Why do you hate America?|promoted to SysOp level]] just because he held a grudge against ED. This time, he was under the name of his favorite SysOp to whom he still obsesses over to this very day, [[Zaiger]]420. Even after months after his ban, he just can't move on from his pitiful mistakes of the past. Within time, ED users discovered the existence of this abomination and successfully raped it to death.

TG then took over and created his own wiki, the '''Hateline Wiki''', Failcyclopedia's successor. What makes this one fail even harder than the last is that it was hosted on [[Wikia|a dumbed-down version of Wikipedia]] and only one article existed. However, ''not even Wikia'' wants him there to poison them, so his wikis were deleted. He also went on DeviantART wikia to host his articles, but unfortunately for his end, an admin banned him.

Afterward, he purportedly recreated Hateline Wikia. He has yet to post an actual link to the goddamn site.

===As Rizden===
[[File:EDFDiscussionTGFirst.jpg|center|frame|The very post that re-introduced ED to TGcomix.]]
[[Image:RizdensCurrentPage.jpg|thumb|Rizden's userpage vandalized (and getting locked) successfully by the [[Elite|big kids]].]]

After the birth of the [[ED Forums]], many tartlets hung around the [[DeviantART]] board ranting about other [[Everyone|shitty artists]]. One day, they discovered TGcomix and his blatant faggotry on DeviantART. From then on, tartlets from that board decided to [[debate]] with TGcomix on the topic of his pornography. After going through his entire gallery, [[Delete Fucking Everything|and reporting all of his submissions]], TG was banned yet again from DA. This then led to TG coining the term "flaggot", and often using it to describe every single person he hates.

Eventually, this very page was created, and his enemies directed him to here through his Hentai-Foundry. As a response, TG made another horridly bad article on them on [[Illogicopedia]]. However, even TGcomix, himself, knows that it will never faze them one bit since it was hosted on a crassly made wiki. TG has yet again registered on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] under the name '''Rizden''' and pretended to be an eager contributor and vandalize the pages of his enemies.

Doing the exact same thing that he has done before, TG slowly turned this article into an exact mirror of it's predecessor; the article on [[Web 1.0|Chanceblacktown]]. That task, however, required no efforts, since TG archived every article he attempted to create on various wikis he joined. In addition to that, he ported many of his old and new attack articles onto his userspace.

This was not enough, however. He continued to update the article, and it continued to suck. He then proceeded to "archive" it - by which he meant remove it from his talk and user page - and offer the "[[Jesus|olive branch of peace]]." He reminded the user that he was simply "hazing" him, though generally when one imagines hazing one thinks of a simple and collaborated effort against a single individual. Which is ironically exactly what TGcomix, *ahem*, Rizden brought on himself.

However, since [[Zaiger]] was no longer a mod, Rizden thought that he had absolute invincibility. Even to veteran EDitor, TG still thinks that he is a genius when writing ED. Unlike his previous account, other users have noticed the cancer dwelling within him. Many EDitors teamed up with each other to mock and vandalize his page. Although he could simply revert these edits, the mods were also disgusted by Rizden's [[mod sass]]. Both his user and talk page were vandalized and locked; causing TG to be butthurt and cry back home to [[FanArt Central|Hentai Foundry]]. Despite his most current user not being banhammered, the attacks that he have received were too much for him to handle and thus leaving ED.

==Psychological analysis==
[[Image:TG_Child_Abuse.jpg|thumb|TG's compassionate views on childrearing.]]

TGcomix is a curious pervert, often relying on lies and hypocrisy when reality fails to suit his needs. For example, he often complains about a given online community collectively organizing to purge him for reasons incomprehensible to his insular mind, but then attempts to organize [http://anonib.com/snfca/res/186.html hate] [http://88.80.21.12/topic/43017 mobs] of his own with [[fail|predictable results]].

He seems to identify with the transsexual population, regularly posting images of young boys being forcibly emasculated on [[TG Comics]]. Taken in context of his frequent use of homophobic insults - ie: flaggot, the homophobic insults in his attack requests - imply the pitiful inability to come to terms with his sexual identity and blossom into the beautiful fairy we all know he is.

Another absurd tendency in his flawed persona is his verbal harrassement of those who disagree with his definition of "lolicon" and "child erotica." He frequently claims that children with breasts are automatically not children at all, despite the fact that they now look like 9 year old girls mutilated with breast implants. However, TG's world is a small one, and if a fact or observation does not coincide with his self-glorifying beliefs, so much the worse for the facts and anyone who dares believe them.
