A frank discussion of mental illness
[[Image:Fireplace.jpg|thumb|I wrote this article with the gravitas and compassion required of such things. Now where's my bottle?]] 

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about '''mental illness''' here on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. Mental illness is a [[serious]] condition affecting at least one third of all [[Americans]] in a given year; this figure rises [[dramatically]] on the [[internets]], where three out of three people are mentally ill. Some have attributed the rise of mental illness to [[angst]]-ridden [[emos]] who turn every little quirk into a big disease to effect [[Internet drama|drama]]. Whatever the case, there is an estimated eighty-five (85) [[statistics|percent]] chance you are mentally ill yourself.

== Why You Should Care ==

Other than the fact that you yourself are probably seriously mentally ill, chances are quite high that, if you have engaged in any kind of online interaction (always practice safe hex!), you have had to deal with a mentally deranged individual. [[Usenet]] and [[Internet Relay Chat]] are the psychiatric institutions of the internets. On Usenet in particular, you will find people with [[anal character]]s disagreeing with each other on the placement of commas for a good part of their life (see [news:alt.usage.english alt.usage.english]) and disruptive [[trolls]] with severe [[internet troll personality disorder]].

Mentally ill people are also responsible for 99.999999% of [[Crapflood|teh drama]] on all of the internets combined. This includes everything from petty [[Narcissism|self-dramatizing]] spats to insane [[Raver|ravings]]. If you find yourself in the midst of a mentally ill person's [[drama]], the best course of action is to [[Masturbation|stop]], [[Crap|drop]], and [[music|rock and roll]]! 

== Degrees of Being Fucked Up ==
[[Image:Madness.jpg|thumb|This is what the world looks like to a mentally ill person.]] 

Some people say being mentally ill is not about being ''fucked up''; these people contend that it is about alternative takes on [[reality]]. These people, of course, are mentally ill themselves, and so this article will continue only with '''mainstream''' psychiatric opinion.

'''Mental illness''' is a kinder term for what is colloquially known as the state of being [[fucked up]]. That said, being fucked up comes in different flavors and degrees. [[Emo]] kids, filled with [[angst]] and tendencies towards [[self injury]] have classic [[borderline personality disorder]]. People with [[Asperger's syndrome]] are robots who, despite loading massive amounts of data onto their brains, are fundamentally incapable of regular social interaction. [[Psychopath|Cyber psychos]] will pass themselves off as the perfect lady or gentleman only to find out where you live so that they can come to your home to [[Anal sex|rape you up the ass]] while you sleep.

The Internets also regularly exposes people to the risk of developing new mental illnesses. Unprepared boys in puberty who find [[picture]]s of [[Carmen Electra]] risk developing a [[Carmen Electra complex]].

== Self-Diagnosis in the Community==

Many Internet communities encourage people to fake having mental illness as a rite of entry. Notable examples include the [[Carmen Electra complex]], restless leg syndrome, [[inconsistent personality disorder]] and [[LiveJournal]].

== How Psychology Can Cure YOU! ==

Do you often feel [[depressed]]?  Do you often wish you were a different kind of person?  Do you like sniffing glue and [[yiffing]] to furry porn for days and weeks on end?  Well, if you do, fear not, for psychology is the cure to all your troubles!

[[Psychology]] is a wonderful, insightful branch of [[science]] that deals with the mind. It can cure anything from [[AIDS]] to [[autism]] to the rolls of [[lard]] around your midsection through a combination of therapy and medication. Psychology is based on the following sound scientific principles:

# Bitching to a [[random]] person, [[attention whore]] style, for 30 minutes to an hour will heal your deep-seated emotional wounds.
# Getting to know your many, many mental and character flaws will make you a better, healthier person.
# Assholes with PhDs in psychoanalysis are better mental influences than your <s>closest, most trusted friends</s>. lol, [[you]] don't have any friends.
# Nothing is ever your fault. When you kill ten people in a [[drunken]] [[rage]] with a sharpened spork, you didn't commit a [[crime]] - you were simply displaying symptoms of your illness! But...
# ...at the same time, EVERYTHING is your fault, including your genes, the time you were in a [[car]] accident when you were 3 because mommy was [[drunk]], and the time your ex-best friend killed your hamster with lye when you were on vacation - all due to ''your'' negative thinking.  THINK POSITIVE THOUGHTS!
# ''Everyone'' secretly wants to [[fuck]]/[[kill]] their parents, suck massive amounts of [[cock]], save the world, destroy the world, become a [[tranny]], eat delicious cocks with tartar sauce over a bed of lettuce, and rape themselves with vegetables.
# If you don't like psychology, then it's likely due to the fact that your superego has repressed conscious aggression that originated from libidinal impulses in your subconscious drives that manifested as the Elektra Complex which came about because you lost your green magic marker when you were two years old and couldn't finish coloring your ''Sesame Street'' coloring book.
# Every trainer has a choice, to listen to the voice inside.

==Id, ego & SSSSUPER-ego==

The id is the part of your brain that likes to get high and drunk then [[Colton Harris Moore| steal a car and drive it to a rich neighborhood to steal a small plane to fly it to the Bahamas.]] The id is everything that is bad about you. Id wants to murder your wife and children. The Ego is the concerned friend of psycho id. He tries to calm down the id when it convinces you taking that cops gun and emptying the clip into a crowd of people is a good idea. Most of the time id > ego. Super-ego is the [[NORP]] cousin of ego. The super-ego will do everything by the rules. Most anal retentive assholes are controlled by the super-ego. Before the invention of laws, the super-ego did not exist in anyone's brains; they all raped and killed everything in sight because id told them to.
