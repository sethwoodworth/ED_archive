{{youtube2|dahalochick|dahalochick}} ([[power word|Gina Giannetti]], Ginachu, ハローのひよこ) is a part of a long line of [[weeaboos|victims]] who are suffering from [[anime|Japan's revenge for WWII]].  [http://twitter.com/TheGinachu '''Ginachu'''] made her [[earthquake|mark]] on the [[Internet]]s by being a [[Shipping|professional writer]], [[obvious|professional food critic]], [[Girugamesh|professional anime panelist]], [[fat|female heavyweight champion of the world]], and [[YouTube Nobodies|professional obnoxious vlogger]] inflicted with [[4chan|Japan syndrome]]. '''DaHaloChick''' refines the [[weeaboo]] lexicon, and would probably eat [[you]] alive if given the opportunity.

|I'm living in Long Island, New York trying my hardest to make it day-to-day and pursue my dream of becoming [[fat|a published fiction novel writer]]. I love to [[eat|write]] and [[eat|read]], and I also do quite a bit of my own [[eating|photography]]. I'm also very passionate about [[eating|the anime industry and Japanese culture]] in general. Nothing makes me happier than my [[food|friends and family]].|
|I'm just a [[fat|small town]] girl, living in a lonely world. Okay, not really. I'm a [[fat|small-town]] girl living on Long Island. The art of [[food|literature]] is my greatest passion in life, and I am very serious about [[eating|pursuing that passion]] so that I can [[show everyone online that i did|share it with the world]]. It's my greatest wish that someone will one day pick up a book of mine in a store, read it, and have it brighten their day. To share the joy and power of [[food|the written word]] is what I want to dedicate [[eating|my life]] to. I also am a lover and practitioner of [[eating|photography]], although I find I'm rather lacking in [[fat|that regard]]. I feel as if I need to learn more about [[eating|photo editing]] before I can really dig into this particular [[dessert|medium]], but I still love capturing as many beautiful [[Double downs|shots]] as I can. I am very open to [[eating|learning]] new things and improving my [[weight|craft]], and so any [[trolling|constructive criticism]] you may have on any of my works is more than welcome. So long as there is [[food|respect]] given, it will be [[eaten|returned]].|
|My name is Gina Giannetti. I am an aspiring writer born and raised in Long Island, New York in a fairly [[racist|traditional Italian family]]. Besides my [[food|family]] and [[food|friends]] (who will forever be the [[food|treasures]] that enrich my [[mouth|life]]), my [[mouth|life]] mainly involves [[eating|around working]] to [[fatten|overcome]] myself and my own [[weight|faults]] to rise above and eventually reach my [[BBW|goal]] of being a [[fatty|published author]], [[eating|sharing]] my [[food|passion]] with the world. Throughout my [[basement dweller|life]], I’ve developed a [[hardon|passion]] for [[weeaboo|Japanese culture, anime, video games, writing and literature, photography]], [[faggot|Norse mythology]], and [[lunch|several]] [[dinner|other]] [[dessert|things]].|

Gina is your average [[Fat|morbidly obese]] [[weeaboo]] ''(But alas, I repeat myself)''. She would be completely non-noteworthy if not for the fact that she has deluded herself into believing she is "living the dream" by snagging a job at a [[Lie|hip and trendy]] [http://out-of-timeproductions.com/ anime-centric production company]. Nevermind the fact that the "company" has nothing of note to their name, that it generates no profit, and that her co-workers were all her close friends before the company started. She is currently "employed" as the company publicist, though she has apparently {{youtube|NqR5OlPRu5Q|dabbled in what it jokingly referred to as "acting"}}.

[[File:Ginachu dahalochick.jpg|thumb|right|GINACHU used INFLATION!]]
[[File:Ginapermavirgin.jpg|thumb|left|Actually, she's a [[Virgin#PermaVirgin|permavirgin]].]]

Despite being [[Why do you hate America?|sickeningly anime-savvy]], Gina is decidedly oblivious to how the internet works. Having dropped out of "Web 101" after learning how to watch streaming anime, the majority of her web activity is limited to [http://twitter.com/TheGinachu within the walls of her Twitter account] and posting {{youtube2|dahalochick|laughably long vlogs on YouTube}} which no one in their right mind would possibly sit through. She also maintains a ''(Mercifully)'' rarely updated [http://ginachu.wordpress.com/ anime-themed blog], where she discusses [http://ginachu.wordpress.com/my-projects/ her anime-themed projects], and generally goes on and on about fucking anime shit in every post she pens.

It is safe to say that literally every aspect of her miserable existence relates in some way to anime, or her attempts to pay homage to the glorious nation of [[Japan]]. It is [[Unrealistic expectations|her life's dream]] that one day, the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOuumGX-6uc glorious emperor of Japan] will notice her contributions to the "Japanese Culture Movement of America", and pay for her flight to Japan. Luckily, this dream will never come to fruition, as there is no aircraft currently in existence ''(Or currently in development)'' fit to carry cargo of her weight.

[[File:Gina-a-4chanisscarrrrry.jpg|thumb|right|Little does she know, [[4chan#Imageboard_Guide|/a/]] is the least of her worries. In response to the [[soft trolling|srs trolling]] /a/ unleashed, Gina deleted the room tour video ''(Originally posted on her YT)''.]]
[[File:Tweetslocked.png|thumb|right|Gina tries to keep the trolls at bay by flipping the switch to "private".]]
[[File:Elawlyertogina.jpg|thumb|right|Gina's friend dispensing [[Retarded|brilliant]] legal advice.]]

[[Last Thursday]], the [[Pussy troll|trolling elite]] over at [[4chan#Imageboard_Guide|4chan's /a/]] ''(Who are behind every notable trolling operation ever conducted on the internet, as well as convincing the [[JEWS DID WTC|Jews to do WTC]])'' caught word of Gina's numerous disgraces to the honor of glorious Japan, and launched a trolling operation so [[epic]] in scale that it actually managed to ''scare Gina into closing / privatizing her internet accounts'': [[OMG|They linked to a video she had uploaded of her giving a tour of her friend's room in a thread about anime collections, and made a few posts making fun of it]]. If that sounds too cruel and unusual even for the [[Psychopath|sociopathic]] [[internet hate machine]] the world must quietly refer to as /a/, you clearly underestimate how callous these monsters can be. Gina clearly made the right move in closing her accounts and [[Delete fucking everything|deleting fucking everything]]: If she hadn't, she may very well have lost her life already.

==Continued Trolling==
While Gina ineffectively attempts to remain [[Paranoid|secretive]] and is prone to [[delete fucking everything]] at the first sign of criticism, her "friends" and co-workers are little more than your standard [[Attention whore|attention whores]]. To ensure maximum shaming, attempts at [[trolling]] should be disguised as attacks / parodies of her bullshit production company, rather than direct attacks on Gina herself. This way, the other members of the company will eagerly respond to you and encourage you to post [[moar]], even at the risk of going against the wishes of Gina. An example of this tactic in action can be seen in the following [[YouTube Commentary|commentary]], demonstrated by a group of [[METOKUR|seasoned commentators]].

<center><youtube>32wx3Gk0eMk</youtube></center>

Not only was this commentary accepted as a video response to the original video, but the channel went so far as to [[Lol|favorite the video as well]]! Not only that, but a [http://www.youtube.com/user/Danashae user claiming to be the actress] in the first half of the video commented on and favorited the video as well, confirming that the video made it's rounds around the proverbial office, and that Gina ''(More likely than not)'' [[Just as planned|has seen it herself]]. Remember: Just because a target doesn't directly acknowledge your attack doesn't mean it wasn't hurt by it.

|Japanese pop music. Sounds a lot better and is much more real than American music. The music generally sounds like a mix of pop, rock, and techno. This mixture produces a unique sound that is very pleasing to the ear.|Jon "You don't need to know Japanese in order to enjoy J-pop" Ingoglia
|The music is very addictive. In fact, it's all I listen to. With the exception of Puffy AmiYumi, J-pop cannot be found in American music stores. The best place to buy J-pop music from IMO is YesAsia.com. They have a wide selection and good prices.|
|Wow. The Japanese know how to make music. American artists should learn a thing or two from J-pop artists.|
