'''Poetry.com''' is a [[hoax]] website which draws in [[16_year_old_girls|16 year-old girls]] and [[emo|other teenage poets]]. The editors accept poetry contributions and your email address, and emails you every month to offer you [[buttsecks|a book with your poetry in it]] for an insanely large price, and to sell you tickets to their annual convention. All of which is [[lies]] spun purely to stop you feeling [[butthurt]] when your faggy or emo poem on [[Bolt]] is shot down by the [[fascism|elitist]] [[fags]] who wield the [[banhammer]].
