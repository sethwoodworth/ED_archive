A '''Transgendered''' person or "'''Tranny'''" is a type of [[otherkin]] who, rather than believing themselves to be [[dragons]] or some other beastly organism, believe themselves to have been born with a brain whose gender differs from that the gender clearly defined by the chromosomes, hormones and genitals they possess. What this all boils down to when you subtract the [[bullshit|complicated science]] is that transexuality is caused when a regular [[homosexual]] has such severe [[homophobia]] that they literally aren't man enough to admit they're craving a deep dicking without making up an excuse, like being "sort of" a woman.

Some transgendered persons are also '''transsexuals'''. These individuals may [[mutilate]] the shit out of the genitals they were given by the <s>good Lord</s> [[Jebus]] in order to loosely approximate those of the opposite sex. Others just take hormones and either [[Castration|remove]] or cripple their [[nads]], since you need to retain your [[penis]] to make it in today's competitive shemale [[porn]] industry.

Recent [[evidence suggests]] that [[4chan]] users make up roughly [[90%]] of all those who decide to take the plunge. The other 9.9% are [[borderline]] individuals with profound identity disturbance; the final 0.1% are made up of those who actually feel a deep-seated need to be a different gender.

== Types of Trannies ==

(Trannies come in different flavors too!)

Trannies can be divided into a larger number of sub-subspecies (Yes a tranny did edit this. shhhhhh no one but [[You]] knows:

== Fuckable Trannies ==

[[Alexis|You know you'd hit that.]] If [[you]] truly believe that you wouldn't, contact any [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] user in your area; they will gladly pump you full of [[drugs]], [[alcohol]] and [[steroids]] until you're willing to fuck anything that moves (or doesn't).

Drag queens are sometimes considered transgendered. However, expressing this viewpoint is only acceptable (i.e. ''not'' [[retarded]] if it is used in the context of trolling. 

[[It has been argued]] that these individuals are simply [[4chan]]ners that didn't get enough attention from the opposite sex and figured that they would try to get some as the other gender. Only someone who spends most of their life [[OTI]] would actually think this is a good idea.

==Persecution==
Although regular trannies are generally tolerated, fat trannies for some reason have endured huge amounts of [[Truth|government sponsored, public supported]] discrimination on a level not seen since [[Niggers|segregation]]. [[Wikipedia:Trans_fats#Public_response_and_regulation|In multiple countries and local municipalities trannies are well regulated.]] In [[New York City]] for instance, fat trannies are not allowed in nearly all restaurants. Perhaps this is an attempt to make them skinnier. Nevertheless, the silence that has greeted this mass destruction of human rights has been greatly concerning- to them. Nobody else really gives a damn.  

Standard [[Pussy|bleeder]] organizations like the UN and the World Health Organization have not yet spoken out against this <s>grievous</s> understandable persecution.
