Buttertroll

A buttertroll is a vile and disgusting creature from the depths of hell, typically a woman (but sometimes a man) who has more body fat than skin.

Normally, women this [[fat]] have to have their sexual partners pour flour on their [[pussy|cooch]] in order to find the [[pussy|wet spot]]. Men who fuck women this size adhere to the teachings of philospher Dante Hicks, and utilize his time-honored [[sex|sexual technique]] which goes as such: "Insert somewhere close, preferably warm and wet, thrust, repeat."

Also, someone hideously ugly or deformed can, in fact, be claimed as a buttertroll.

Men in this condition often use enough baby powder to soothe the diaper rash of a small third world country, and suffer from stinky, cheesy smelling dick butter.

Scientists are still debating whether or not to count a buttertroll's body fat as an "organ," even though it performs a bodily function: keeping the buttertroll ugly.
