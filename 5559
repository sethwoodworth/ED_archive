'''Muzz''', a.k.a. Shelley Eve, is a [[furry]] [[artist]] who specializes in [[lie|perfectly proportionate]] anatomy as seen in her [[shit|lovely]] art.  Her favorite past times include going on [[delete fucking everything|deletion sprees]] all over the [[internets]] after she has been told that she is a bitch.  She has done this many times, and can be seen throughout her galleries as all of them are as full as a black person's pantry.  In a further effort to prove that she is an adult that can handle criticism she also got a [[sock puppet]] account here at ED and tried to blank this page.

Muzz is only interested in being acquainted with good artists; mediocre artists are not worth her time.<br \>

If she tries to befriend you, [[GTFO|run the fuck away]]. Chances are she'll request art (most likely porn of her characters) from you over and over and over and over again, enough to drive even minds of steel to madness. She's a certified leech.

== Commissions ==

All [[furry]] [[faggots]] love to get commissions from artists, especially if they draw hueg PENISES and [[vore]].  But Muzz totally doesn't like drawing said pieces because she doesn't like them.  BUT she still draws vore pretty much all the time and at least 99.999999% of her pieces including her character are of vore.  

She also likes to sell copies of her art.  Not a big deal, because [[noone|anyone]] would shell out 10 bux for a print (maybe $20 for a signed one) but she doesn't like to ship things because everything she sends gets stolen.  Instead, she'd rather sell you a OMGHIGHQUALITY jpg of the piece, minus the assload of watermarks all over it (but with a teeny Â© Jax on the bottom). Now, most people would say "Hay, I'd pay ten bux for a [[Dickgirl|herm]] eating a fox while jerking off to Penn and Teller pr0n" but you're gonna have to shell out 37 bux to see it without the watermarks.

== Recent Drama == 

[[Image:OMGKNIFE.jpg|thumb|I WISH I HAD NEVER LEARNED HOW TO PICK UP A PENCIL!]]On her FurAffinity account, she decided that she'd like to have a go at trying to sell her herm art on FurBid (like she has for the 9,000th time).  Several people said that "$37 is a bit too steep for something that isn't even a hard copy."  She decided she didn't like it and bitched at everyone who said that it was overpriced.  Many [[lulz]] were had when she said that she needs to make a living off her art and how she needs to pay her bills, etc. One user went as far as to actually get into an argument with her over it, and later apologized.  

Being the [[emo]] dramawhore [[Bosnian]] she is, she never replied to him and instead created another rant in another journal, but failed to mention any names.  She followed up with an image of her character about to cut off her hand with a butcher's cleaver with the tag line "Sometimes I wish I never learned how to pick up a pencil."  The same person replied with "So, are you going to sell this for $37 too?" and she committed e-suicide (third time!) after that.  She deleted all of her art from all of her galleries and set sail to join [[an hero]].

Another recent drama happened when someone pointed out that Muzz had only just learned how to [[masturbate]] at the tender age of 20, and that it was understandably hilarious. However this person was obviously not being malicious and didn't even mention Muzz's name in her one liner of a journal entry "HOW DO I TOUCHED SELF?"<br \>
All the drama was since deleted after the OP told Muzz to stfu, and that she was making herself look dumb seeing as nobody would have even known who the post was referring to if she'd kept quiet.
Sadly the original image uploaded to FA where Muzz tells the WHOLE WORLD that she only just discovered where the placement of her clit was has been deleted following the drama. So if anyone has screencaps, plz to be giving.

Feb 12, 2008: The bitch is at it again, being an easily aggravated dramawhore threatening to leave due to getting her ass handed to her by a fellow [[furfag]] who called the bitch out on tracing poses.


'''Feb 13, 2008'''<br \>
Bitch has now left FA and posted a [[Unfunny|LULZ]] image to hold over her gallery until she gets back from her [[BAWWWW]]fest and [[butthurt]] posting more [[furry]] p0rnz to make it up to her faggot [[fantards|watchers]].

'''May, 2009'''<br \>
Once again Muzz has switched accounts and now trades under the name Biodiesel, further spreadin her emo across Furaffinity and making it difficult for the few genuine fans of her art to follow her.

'''January, 2010 - Another year another fursona'''<br \>
After a trip to Sea World, and seeing fat Shamu-ass (which made Muzz tingle in places she didn't know she had), Muzz changed her fursona to an otter/whale hybrid called Sushi. The new name change prompted so much flak from the Lulz community that Muzz promptly deleted both her FA and twitter named after her three-week fursona. She has since moved back to her Gatorfox fursona, but her DA account with that name has been OMGHAXX0RED. She also briefly had a formsping "ask me anything" poll, but she bawwleeted that too after one too many people asked her why she was a bipolar sociopath. Look forward to seeing more insanity from Muzz this year as the first three weeks have already proven to be entertaining.

Muzz is planning to attend EF this year and is going to fursuit there, even. Gonna be a riot for sure!

'''March 2010'''

The bitch has changed accounts around again. Good luck hunting her down. 

Muzz proves why furfags should never be allowed to care for pets. Her pet kitten
committed suicide by jumping from a balcony to escape her neglect. This is the second cat that has run the fuck away from Muzz in six months.
The first ran away from home to <strike>get hit by a truck</strike> find a family that could offer better care than Muzz and Pliskin.

'''May, 2010 - Hath Changed Fursonas AGAIN'''<br\>
[[Image:Muzzlol.jpg|thumb|I'm not copying Sirod, I just decided to be like her after I met her and saw how popular she is :(]]
After a failed attempt to befriend Sirod (Another furry artist) and boost her popularity, she decided she'd do the next best thing and [[copy]] her instead. She is now a border collie, but she is [[lie|totally not copying Sirod, even though she wears the exact same color and are now the same species]]. But after someone actually called her out on it, she b'aaaawed and claimed Sirod copied her, even though Sirod has been a border collie for five years, and Muzz just decided to be one AFTER she met her.

'''December, 2010 - I'm staying put! Wait... No, I'm retarded. Yes I am.'''<br\>
Two weeks after making a livejournal post promising her legion of fans that she was returning to her Muzz alias and was not going to change it any longer; Muzz has changed names/accounts again. She's now going by Oskip on livejournal and Osker on FA. What a dumb bitch, why make promises you can't keep?

== The Future ==

Only time will tell when she will decide that she needs to get off her fat ass and get a real job instead of shitting on her fans because she would rather make an asston of money by pulling the sale tactic of the PS3 (more money, fewer items available) compared to the Wii (less money, a ton more items available).   She'll be back to show how much of an emo she is by drawing more shit she doesn't like and by bitching about it a ton.

Eventually her emotionally blackmailed homosexual boyfriend Pliskin will grow a pair and leave her, leaving her spiralling out of her comfort zone with many lols to witness. There are rumours that he's already sleeping around (and who could BLAME him?) because he's getting tired of supporting a crazy, clingy leech like Muzz. I mean, the bitch got rid of his pet ferrets because she was jealous. Watch this space folks, we're either going to see suicide threats or Muzz will desperately forgive her cheating homo boyfriend in order to remain comfortably suckling at his metaphorical teat (aka:cock and wallet).
