Richard Jeni
[[Richard Jeni]] was a half-[[Wop]], second-rate [[comedian]] and alleged comedy writer who became [[An Hero]] on March 10, 2007, after [[suicide|blowing a hole in his face the size of his face]]. Instead of dying immediately, Jeni instead enjoyed many painful additional minutes of life reflecting on his face, which now took on the fashionable appearance of a strawberry pie mashed in by a [[skinhead]]'s steel-toe boot. [[Police]] launched a vigorous investigation [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/n/a/2007/03/11/state/n114828D53.DTL in which they classified his death as a "possible suicide."]

When he wasn't appearing on pathetic celebrity game shows and painfully [[unfunny]] [[Comedy Central]] specials, Jeni often accomplished the amazing feat of writing [[shit|drivel]] for [[unfunny]] actors and [[comedian]]s like [[Nigra|Chris Rock]] that made them even [[unfunny|less funny]]. He was also [[unfunny]] by himself, and almost single-handedly destroyed what little humorous value [[The Aristocrats]] had to begin with.
