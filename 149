'''AOHell''' was the first of what became 1000's of hacker proggies created for use with [[AOL]].
<br>    
Starting in ~1994 when a 17 year old hacker from Pittsburgh known as "Da Chronic" on the [[internets]] used [[Visual Basic]] to create a toolkit that provided a new DLL for the [[AOL]] client, a credit card number generator, Email bomber, IM bomber, Punter, and a basic set of instructions to use it. An all-in-one nice convenient way to break federal fraud law, violate interstate trade regulations, and rack up a couple of good [[old media|ol' telecommunication]]s infractions in one fell swoop. When the program was loaded it would play a short clip from Dr. Dre's 1993 song "Nuthin but a G Thang". "Da Chronic" claims in the manual that he made it to protect the [[13 year old boy]]s from [[gay]] [[pedophiles]] -- the pedos who aren't gay men are fine.

Oddly, [http://web.archive.org/web/20040411205803/http://www.blackhat.info/live/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=4637 blackhat.infos] timeline is wrong, since AOHell, as a complete toolkit, was around well before 1997. Of course, before 1996, it also fit on a single 3.5" floppy disk.

== AOHell and how it was used ==
[[Image:Gencoide2600andAOHell.JPG|thumb|AOHell being used as "Da Chronic" intended.]]
<br>
The proggie was mostly used for [[trolling]] due to it's ability to provide excellent [[lulz]].
<br> 
The proggie was found very useful by a group of [[hackers]] know as "Genocide2600" who happened to be EHAP, 'Ethical Hackers Against Pedophilia' enthusiast.
<br>
The "Genocide2600" kept a link to EHAP's website on the front page of their own website and was well known for launching lengthy attacks against online [[pedophiles]].      
<br>
A pdf with some screen shots and info of the use of AOHell by Genocide2600 members can be found [http://www.genocide2600.com/~genocide/genocide-confessions.pdf here]. 
<br>
Genocide2600's hacker group once containing 100's of active members is not as active today but they are still [http://www.genocide2600.com/ here].

== AOHell and the news ==
[[Image:AOHellNewspdf.JPG|thumb|AOHELL [[Oh noes!]]]]
<br>
AOHell caused great havoc on [[AOL]] which was even covered by a [[faggot]] journo named  "Simon Garfinkel" whose story first appeared in ''The Boston Globe'', April 21, 1995. 
<br>
In Simon [[Faggot]] Garfinkel's story he claimed that in AOHell's instruction manual the author "Da Chronic" said he only created the program because he hated the [[AOL]] staff and wanted to cause as much chaos as possible...despite the real Anti-Pedophile reason it was created being out there in the open from the very fucking start.
<br>
Clearly Simon Garfinkel is a [[faggot]] [[pedophile]] himself, hence intentionally leaving out the blatant Anti-Pedohpile reason for the proggies existence.

==What AOL did to combat AOHell ==
[[Image:AOHellSpyware.JPG|thumb|It's just a white [[lie]].]]
<br>
[[AOL]] would terminate the account of anyone using AOHell, this did little good as they couldn't stop a user from creating a new one for free with AOHell.
<br>
[[AOL]] also put out [[bullshit]] hype about the program being infected with [[spyware]] and viruses making it just as dangerous as [[Computer Gremlins]].
<br>
Ultimately the heightened security that came at the end of the [[90s]] with the release of AOL 4.0's greatly redesigned interface caused most hacker proggies to cease working. So was the end of [[AOL]]'s [[warez]] scene.
