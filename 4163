J/k
'''j/k''' stands for "just kidding", should be accompanied with a '''[[;-)]]'''. If someone is j/k-ing, you should be [[lolz]]ing.

==Usage==
''This is how you would use j/k in an everyday situation''
:[[Futhman]]: I hate [[Jews]]
:Quasidan: :'(
:Futhman: j/k [[;-)]]
:Quasidan: OIC lol
''Note: Futhman is lying when he says j/k in this context. We all know jews suck.''

==J/K As a Drama-Generating Technique==
*Say something really offensive and end it with a "j/k", thereby absolving you from any offense that might have been taken (see also [[dubious disclaimer]]).

Example:
:[[OP]] posts in [[amipregnant]]: "I hate everyone who gets pregnant out of wedlock . You are all whores.  j/k"
:[[pregnant]] [[bitch]]: wtf that's not cool.
:OP: chill out broad, I said j/k!
