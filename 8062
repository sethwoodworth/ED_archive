'''''Teen Titans''''' is a comic released [[at least 100 years ago]]. The show's like ''[[X-men]] Evolution'', except featuring less than five million characters.  The show is a remake of a traditional [[American]] cartoon done in [[anime]] style.  There were many reasons for this decision, but the primary reason was because DC wished to bathe in the tears of their older, beardier fans.

[[Newgrounds]] is [[sick fuck|obsessed]] with ''Teen Titans'' [[hentai]].

==The Comic==
[[Image:Teen Titans 5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fap]] material for [[fanboys]].]]

Forever ago, comic book nerds had a [[sarcasm|fantastic idea]]: bring all the sidekicks together for one great fantastic sidekick orgy, so they could skip through the fields of olde and pick flowers and do other gay shit. However, the concept went to hell even before Cartoon Network raped it up the ass. The comic is about a bunch of DC comic rejects who have to band together because they really... really suck. Of course, the comic really is for teens, because we all know how implied rape is for kids, amirite?


==The Show==
If you don't like [[The Gorillaz]], this show is not for you. Therefore this show is for no one.

For people who've never heard of the series before, you will know nothing, and I mean nothing. It's like showing the kid ''Phantom Menace'' before any ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie, they won't have the slightest clue as to what's going on, and if they were wondering what a "Jedi Knight" was, or what "The Force" was, they were shit out of luck. [[Last Thursday]] after [[over 9000]] episodes the series was canceled. BOOM HEADSHOT!!1


==The Characters==
Oh boy! If you like one note characters, then man, it's got a lot of that. These characters are so [[typical]] that <s> almost half </s> ALL of the fans root for the villains! Then again, the villains include [[Joseph Fritzl]], [[Tom Anderson]], [[Satan]], and other [[pedo]]s, so it's no wonder how they [[pwn]] the Titans [[at least 100|90]] percent of the time. Towards the end of the last season, the show suddenly turned on its viewers, attacking them with a flood of characters so flat and shallow that they could not even be called two-dimensional.  Many likened the experience to being jumped by the denizens of [[science|Flat World]].



===[[Furry|Beast Boy]]===
The so called "funny" character that has yet to hit puberty. Cyborg is his best friend, cause like minority groups like [[furries]] and [[niggers]] gotta stick together. Due to this character being a green [[furry|pseudo animal]], he is occasionally put into "OH LAWD! I'M IN HEAT! MUST RAEP/MAKE LOVE TO A WOMYN!" [[fan fiction]]. Falls in love with [[bisexual|every character]] on the show but [[moar]] on that later.  Everyone on the show was able to look past his freakish green color, comical height, and snaggle teeth, and hated him for the more substantial reason of him being an annoying little pickle turd.



===Cyborg===
The black person of the group who receives no fan attention at all, probably because he isn't eatin' fried chicken ,watermelon or playing [[video games]]. Or because he's black. The other characters never refer to him by his real name and call him either [[niger|coon]], [[Star Wars|R2D2]], or [[An Hero|Nigger that took my ipod]].
Is <s>kinda (exactly) like</s> that other black guy with a gun strapped to his arm from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.  Cyborg's main role in the Teen Titans was to stay home and build shit while the white folk (and sometimes the green kid) went out and did the real work.  It was also decided that Cyborg couldn't go on any missions because, like any black person, he drove a loud car and shot everything he saw.

===Raven===
[[Image:TT RavenC.jpg|thumb|left|Raven the [[Emo]] Goddess.]]

Overrated character that happens to be [[goth]], much of the fan art is derived from her.
Raven's father is the [[hell|devil]] Trigon making Raven the fucking anti-christ. She thought Cyborg and Beast Boy were bodyguards for hire, and hangs out with them for awhile and then later joins the team. [[Fangirls]] pair her with Robin because "OMG! TEY HAVE BIRD NAMES! THAT'S SO CUTE!!11" and come up with shit puns like "Birds of A Feather". Of course others pair her with Beastboy because of the [[None|subtext]] and they kiss once in the [[fanfiction|comic book]]. Some people choose the lesbian approach and pair her with Starfire (mainly) or any of the other chicks on the show.

In reality, she'll end up alone with cats because she's a cold sarcastic bitch.  On the plus side, her personality clearly shows her to be a very submissive person, so you'd have little trouble knocking her down, hogtying her, and raping the shit out of her as long as you have a crucifix to smack her with whenever she started acting up.

===Robin===
Leader dude. He takes things super cereal. Maybe because he hangs out too much with [[Batman]]. Like srsly guy. Without him the show would basically not exist because no one except [[geek|spazes]] know who the other characters are. Robin spends at least 1.5 seasons getting slapped around like a rented mule by his arch-nemesis, who got into villainy for no reason other than to fuck with the orphan child of acrobats.

===Starfire===
[[Image:Starfire2.jpg|thumb|left|Why the fucking [[comic]] is [[moar]] better then the Tv show.]]

Robin's mail-order bride and an [[Mary Sue|alien princess from the far away planet of Tamaran.]] The retarded one, but used occasionally for [[Pantyshot|fan service]] or the [[Unfunny|lulz]]. Despite being from another planet she also has problems that average humans can relate to, like her [[bitch]] of a sister trying to take over the planet, being a royal princess, or fighting [[encyclopedia dramatica|villains]] trying to take over the [[internet|planet]]. Yes Starfire is just like every other [[16 year old girl]]. The hotter of the [[women|two]], but has 20% less then fan art/fiction (and [[boobs]])

The original Starfire seduced nerds with her slutty attitude and Vegas stripper body. The new Starfire seduces nerds with a childlike air of innocence and the body of a 14-year-old [[Olympics_Gymnastics_Fanfic|gymnast]].  It just goes to show you how much better things are today.



===[[Loli|Terra]]===

[[Image:TerraJapAnime.jpg|thumb|left|I'd hit it.]]

[[Jailbait|Cheap white meat]] with the power to move the earth with a flick of her wrist. That's a flick of her wrist, not a [[emo|slit]] fucktard. Terra also has the power to get whatever she wants by bitching to her daddy. Later she [[Jumped the shark|jumps the shark]] after taking Beast Boy's [[virgin]]ity and joins the bad guys. She then becomes a [[an Heroine]]. Hated by [[fangirl|fangrills]] everywhere for "BREAKING [[FURRY]]BOIS HEART! THAT BITCH! I'LL KILL THAT SLUT!" For some fucking unknown reason DC brings Terra back to life in the last episode, making [[Fangirls]] BAWWWW that Terra doesn't remember raping Furry Boy.

Terra's also notable for fucking the villain [[Ron Paul|Deathstroke]] in the comics when she was [[16 year-old girls|13]], which makes our one-eyed friend a [[pedophile]] amirite?
