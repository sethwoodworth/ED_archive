Borderline personality disorder

'''Borderline personality disorder''' is a [[DSM|clinical]] term for those generally recognized as so supremely fucked up that insurance companies will gladly pay for them to be tranquilized. If you have borderline personality disorder, you are highly likely to - and rightfully should - [[Suicide|kill yourself]]. Seriously, there's no hope for [[people]] like [[you]]. [[DO IT FAGGOT|Just end it all]].

Anyone claiming to have borderline personality disorder [[OTI]] are of course, wonderful trollbait and contain more [[lulz]]-per-pound than a [[furry]] convention. However, if you ever see one of these [[fucktard|special]] individuals [[IRL]], trolling is ill-advised. BPD can make some people very dangerous and they could become violent given enough irritation. However, if you do decide to risk being decapitated by a raving lunatic, you'd best have a witness there to film dat shit and put it on [[YouTube]].

== Symptoms ==

Borderlines tend to be emotionally manipulative, codependent, demanding, [[masochist]]ic, [[paranoid]], [[Sexual deviant|sexually deviant]], and display temporary [[psychosis]] ([[meth]]-style). They see people as either [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|perfect]] or [[Uncyclopedia|the enemy]]; this varies based on their mood at the time. [[Wikipedia:Elizabeth Wurtzel|Some]] [[mental defective]]s within the [[psychiatric]] community have sought to rename this disorder "[[adolescence]]."

Suffers of BPD are known to [[Schizo|constantly change their mind]] about everything, including their [[Bisexual|sexual orientation]] and even their [[gender]]. This phenomenon is also commonly embraced by [[art school|art student]]s and [[16 year old girl]][http://dumpedbyahallucination.wordpress.com s] who want to impress/freak out their ([[Polyamory|multiple]]?) [[boyfriend]]s.

People with BPD often experience something medically termed ''Being an Emo [[Douchebag]]'' (BED). They like to go on frantic [[emo]]<nowiki>tional</nowiki> rants, often on their [[LiveJournal]] and they can't relate to other people, making them sad-sack loners. This often leads to them becoming self-injurers and possibly even [[Suicide|An heroes]] because nobody understands them, not even themselves. This symptom of self injury has led every [[emo]] in the world to [[e-psychiatry|e-diagnose]] themselves with BPD.

==Causes==

BPD is commonly thought to be caused by childhood trauma, such as being touched by your uncle or having a lost loved one. 
-->
==Treatment==

At present, there is no cure for BPD, though many [[Victims|sufferers]] tend to self-medicate through such means as [[gluttony]], drug abuse, [[self injury]], [[Global financial crisis|excessive spending]], gambling, [[steal]]ing, driving recklessly, and having [[slut|unsafe sex]]. These drug-[[addicted]] dangers-to-society then post videos of themselves doing aforementioned behaviors on [[YouTube]] or elsewhere, although their [[attention]]-binge ends at some point when they go too far and [[Arrested|promptly win]] themselves a luxurious bubble bath [[Prison|vacation]] with [[Bubba]].

An [[experiment]] conducted at a [[London]] laboratory recently showed that [[Wikipedia:arsenic|arsenic]] cured the disease with a [[99%|75%]] [[success]] rate. [[Death]] counted as a success.
