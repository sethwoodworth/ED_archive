Commission
There are three kinds of commissions:
* The kind that explains how John F. Kennedy [[pwned|died]] (in a Warren Commission, scroll down)
* The kind that [[furfag]]s make to support their [[basement-dweller]] lifestyle
* The kind that [[McDonalds|corporate entities]] give to recent [[Homeless|art school graduates]] to make the walls match the products.

==The "Who [[Pwn|Pwn't]] JFK?" Commission==

[[John F. Kennedy]] was a jolly [[old]] man who got summarily [[pwned]] in the head while riding in a motorcade on a visit to Texas. TV forced everyone in the Western world, even [[Anna Nicole Smith|Marilyn Monroe]], and its buddy countries to love the cripple JFK so their [[necrophilia|obsession]] with how he died live on to this very day.

Almost immediately, JFK's successor established the "Who Pwn't JFK?" Commission, more commonly known as the '''Warren Commission''', it was created to investigate who was behind the assassination. They eventually established that the [[Nazi|culprit]] was none other than [[Cho Seung-Hui]], going by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald at the time.

A sophisticated [[whore|e-prostitution]] method employed by people too physically [[Ugly|disgusting]] to whore their bodies out for money. Most commissions are shat out by [[fat|morbidly obese]] [[wapanese]] girls who often charge extensively to support their [[Inuyasha]] obsession and bribe librarians to use the library computers for hours on end. Typically, they live with [[your mom|their mom]] until she dies, and then some time afterwords.
Perhaps unfairly, 13-year-old [[furfag]]s make more art money than people who produce actual works of art. This ill-gotten profit is blown almost entirely on dry-cleaning bills and pre-loved plush toys. 


== The Art Student ==

Talented, eager artists enroll in art colleges every day to spend four years of their lives perfecting the honorable trade of Art - In other words, learning how to fling paint at canvases. Once finished, approximately 1% of the new graduates are eagerly recruited to fill the walls of recently constructed restaurants and clothing stores with their artistic visions. As long as those visions match the products of the store and landscape surroundings and fit neatly into the corporate box, that is.

And what of the other 99%? They return home to create new, artistic methods of cooking [[ramen]].
