'''Psychiatrists''' are the [[Jews|evil, vicious, destructive, greedy, nasty people]] who [[welfare|receive millions of dollars from the Government]] in order to conduct [[Holocaust Porn|sadistic experiments on helpless people]], ruining their lives, and also to prescribe poisonous [[Jenkem|"medications"]] (actually, to be able to prescribe medication to people, aka get you fucked up and forget about your problems...pills, you have to be a clinical psychologist, or a psychiatrist..aka the true devil)  to people that will actually '''make''' them crazy. [[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY/IRL_PROTEST_PAGE|They control]] the [[Nazi|German]] Government and [[Partyvan|Secret Service]] and are responsible for the [[Holocaust]] and [[9/11]]. They are an ancient evil that have been a problem for billions of years. They assisted Lord Xenu's mass-murder of trillions of beings, 75 million years ago.

At least, this is what the [[Scientology]] cult believes them to be.

==What Scientologists are saying about Psychiatrists!==

'''Hubbard taped lecture of 13 Nov 1956, "Aberration and The Sixth Dynamic"'''

<blockquote>"But now, if you really want to make one worse, I'm afraid that you have to go in for mechanical assists. I think you do. I think it takes a mechanical assist like a [[fisting|fist]], or it takes[...] Well, I'll tell you the best one I know; how's that? The best one I know is to take a sheet of glass and put it in front of the preclear -- clear, very clear glass -- which is supercooled, preferably about a -100 centigrade. You got that? Supercooled, you know? And then put the preclear right in front of this supercooled sheet of glass and suddenly shove his face into the glass. Now, that's pretty good. I mean, that was [[Batshit insane|developed about five billion years ago by a whole-track psychiatrist]].</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The mechanism of brainwashing which I gave you, with supercold mechanisms and so forth, is very well known, was used very extensively in the [[fanfiction|Maw Confederation of the Sixty-third Galaxy]]. They had a total psychiatric control of all of their officers and executives, and when they got tired of them they used this specific method of brainwashing."</blockquote>

'''HCO Bulletin of 31 May 1977, "LSD - Years After They Have 'Come Off' LSD"'''

<blockquote>"The way [[LSD]] got popular was because of Henry Luce, the head of [[:Image:Cultofgreed.jpg|Time Magazine]], who publicized it and glorified it from mid-1950 on. He and his wife were under psychiatric care and were on LSD.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Nearly as I can trace it, it [LSD] was the Nazi intelligence drug developed in Switzerland and was probably intended for use in municipal water systems to paralyze the population just prior to an invasion as the invading enemy would then find them all irrational."</blockquote>

''[[Miscarriage|Miscavige]], 2006: "Our global campaign to obliterate psychiatry." Scary shit.''

'''Office of LRH, Confidential, "Project Psychiatry", 22 Feb 1966'''

[[Lie|<blockquote>"A psychiatrist today has the power to (1) take a fancy to a woman (2) lead her to take wild treatment as a joke (3) drug and shock her to temporary insanity (4) incarnate her (5) use her sexually (6) sterilise her to prevent conception (7) kill her by a brain operation to prevent disclosure. (7) ??????????? (8) PROFIT!!!! And all with no fear of reprisal. Yet it is rape and murder. </blockquote>

<blockquote>"We want at least one bad mark on every psychiatrist in England, a murder, an assault, or a rape or more than one.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This is Project Psychiatry. We will remove them."</blockquote>

'''L. Ron Hubbard in Freedom Scientology early in 1969, "International Edition No. 1"''']]

<blockquote>TODAY'S TERRORISM</blockquote>

[[Bullshit|<blockquote>"While western countries are spending billions fighting terrorist activities abroad they are neglecting the one they have at home.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The psychiatrist and his front groups operate straight out of the terrorist text- books.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Setting himself up as a terror symbol, the psychiatrist kidnaps, tortures and murders without any slightest police interference or action by western security forces.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A psychiatrist kills a young girl for sexual kicks, murders a dozen patients with an ice pick, castrates a hundred men. And they give him another million appropriation."</blockquote>]]

'''Current cult leader [[David Miscarriage]], 1995'''

<blockquote>"Let's get rid of psychiatry, and let's bring Scientology to every man, woman and child on this planet."</blockquote>

<s>Of course, not only does the patient have to consent to drug therapy, shock therapy hasn't been used in medicine since the 70s.</s> <s>Psychiatric patients labeled "not competent" aka insane whether because of psychosis, schizophrenia, or even simple depression, can be forced to undergo drug therapy and both electroshock and insulin shock therapy are used today </s> Family still has to give consent. Ever heard of Cho Seung-Hui? Sterilization? That's up to a doctor, and again, only with the patient's consent. Also, surgery is only used for psychiatric treatment if the cause of the symptoms is a tumor nowadays. But, in the old days, ice pick lobotomies could be done for any reason. No one has performed a lobotomy ''in America'' since the 1970s.

== American Psychiatric Association ==

The '''American Psychiatric Association''' is a professional organization of whackjobs who analyzed their own neuroses with such intensity, they received an academic degree in [[abnormal psychology]]. The group has been in a near-permanent state of [[orgasm]] since the advent of the internets. Early psychiatrists were forced to test their theories by [[luring]] a limited number of homeless people into their labs with spurious offers of Twinkies and cheap wine. Today, the miracle of [[modern technology]] allows them to find every aberrant personality imaginable, vocalizing the inner-workings of their psyche for free and at length to everyone in the world. 

Though they do not like to be identified as such, there is at least one member of the APA anonymously present in every internet discussion group, silently observing and taking notes. There are also at least six amateurs present who think that taking Psych 101 in college gives them equal abilities to diagnosis insanity. Amateurs can be recognized by their eagerness to practice elaborate [[e-psychiatry]] without fear of malpractice suits. Professionals can be recognized by their tendency to call people Case Study 452.
