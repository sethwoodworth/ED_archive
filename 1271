WAS INVENTED BY A [[Your_Mom|WOMAN]], WHICH IS [[TITS OR GTFO|PART OF THE PROBLEM]] (THE OTHER PART BEING THAT IT IS STILL GENERALLY TYPED IN [[ALL CAPS]]).

ALL PEOPLE WHO <del>CAN</del> WOULD WORK WITH COBOL ARE [[AN HERO|DEAD]]. COBOL IS A [[Pain_Series|LONG AND SHITTY]] LANGUAGE WHICH IS ENTIRELY TOO VERBOSE.  WITH ABOUT 5 LINES OF C OR C++, YOU COULD EASILY DO WHAT A 100 LINE PROGRAM IN COBOL CAN DO.

THE BASIC HELLO WORLD PROGRAM IS AS FOLLOWS:
<PRE>
        ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
*THIS IS A COMMENT.  PERIODS (BESIDES COMMENTS) DENOTE END OF STATEMENT.
	IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
	PROGRAM-ID.	HELLO WORLD.

	ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
	INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.

	DATA DIVISION.
	WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.

	PROCEDURE DIVISION.
	MAINLINE.
         	DISPLAY "HELLO WORLD".
                END-RUN.
</PRE>

...AND JUST THINK, THAT'S ONLY TO DISPLAY HELLO WORLD...
