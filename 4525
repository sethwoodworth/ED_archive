{{spoiler|HE FUCKING LEFT MSNBC!?!}}
[[image:OlbermannPoliticsTerror.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Truer words have never been spoken.]]
'''Keith Olbermann''' is a [[liberal]] [[old media]] [[troll]] beloved by [[hipsters]] and [[ripper|hardcore]] [[partisan]] Democrats everywhere. He is currently the host of the dedicatedly left-wing political show, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/ '''''Countdown with Keith Olbermann''''']. Think of it as the [[Daily Show]], only more srs, with even [[moar]] [[unfunny]] jokes and ratings that are in the shitter among most demos. He also really, '''really''' hates [[W|George Bush]]. In this, he is something of an antithesis to [[Bill O'Reilly]]; whereas Billo uses lies, blind party-loyalty and fear-tactics to promote all things [[Republican]], Keith uses [[BAWWW|whining]], [[NO U|name-calling]] and dramatized speeches filled with hokey sentimentality to promote '''hatred''' of all things Republican in an obviously [[fake]] and overly-dramatized voice. Calling him a journalist has and will continue to cause [[RAGE]] in [[Sean Hannity|many people]]. Unfortunately, Keith does not generate as much [[lulz]] with his antics as [[Glenn Beck|other]] [[Bill O'Reilly|retarded]] [[Sean Hannity|fuckwits]] do.

== Early Career ==
[[Image:Leaveori.jpg|right|thumb|[[Internet Tough Guy|Olberman is a terminator]] sent to [[pwn]] O'reilly.]]

Prior to getting work as a [[pundit]] for MSNBC, Olbermann was mainly employed as a sportscaster. After leaving ESPN to undergo anal prolapse correction surgery in 1998, [[irony|he got a job with Fox Sports]] as an anchor and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|did the play-by-play for several world series games]]. One day in [[2001]], he decided that he'd rather voice long-winded comments about Guantanamo Bay instead of Mark McGwire's steroids. He was hired by MSNBC, and did [[fellatio|bitch-work]] for 2 years before they realized that [[truth|Phil Donahue's show sucked ass]]. The MSNBC Gods promptly fired Donahue's ancient ass and gave the time slot to Olbermann, who started a show called ''Countdown: Iraq'' to push MSNBC's anti-war propaganda. After [[Americunts]] ended up invading Iraq anyway, they changed the premise to the [[rage]]-filled Bush bashing and [[Billo The Clown|O'Reilly]] trolling that we know and love today. Olbermann routinely displays his [[bullshit|metaphysical math skills]], as he is dedicated to [[wut|demonstrating how having one-half of O'Reilly's ratings actually means his show is more valuable to advertisers]], citing something about [http://tvbythenumbers.com/2008/05/16/oreilly-vs-olbermann-through-thursday-may-15/3801 ages 25-54] being [[shit no one cares about|"more important"]].

==Countdown to the End of the World==
[[Image:Keef_olbermann.jpg|right|thumb|A [[I came|typical moment]] on Countdown.]]

[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/ Countdown] is the [[hugbox|soapbox]] Keith uses to [[ejaculate|spew]] his anti-conservative rhetoric. He constantly deludes himself into believing that he [[trolls|debunks]] every single thing that [[Bill O'Reilly]] [[bullshit|says]], since [[The Colbert Report|no one else wants to]]. He is so [[homosexual|obsessed]] with Bill O'Reilly (who he calls '''[[Billo The Clown]]''') that he makes a point to mention him on every episode of ''Countdown''. Every ''Countdown'' ends with a reminder that it is "[[9000|Day X]] since George Bush declared, [[Iraq|"MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!"]] from the deck of an aircraft carrier in the [[Iran|Persian Gulf]]." However, Olby suddenly became pro-war when [[Black Jesus|Obama]] was elected and pledged moar soldiers to baby-raping duty in [[Afghanistan]].

Unlike Billo, Olby does not have guests with opposing viewpoints on his show to scream at (it's not nice to pick on retards).  His lineup of "usual guests" includes about 10 people from [[old media|Newsweek and Time]], editors of [[socialist|obscure leftist]] newspapers, [[George Carlin|unfunny liberal comedians]], an idiot ultraliberal GWU professor and [[fag|Joel McHale]]. Everyone he incessantly rants about has no chance to rant back, since it would interrupt his calculatedly rehearsed script. His show is closely associated with that of his dyke cheerleader, [[Rachel Maddow|Rachel Madcow]].

===[[Tl;dr|Speshel Comments]]===
{{quote|You are a [[Godwin|fascist]]. Get them to print you a t-shirt with "fascist" on it.|Olbermann}}

At the heart of the 30 Rockefeller Center, buried within an electromagnetically sealed vault crafted by Akashic monks harnessing pure essence of [[STFU]] and embedded in Kryptonite sits Keith's liberal stick of +10 summoning, which he uses to converse with the great Quezacotl about the coming of [[Catnarok]]. Their published conversations are known to the rest of the world as "[[Special]] Comments". Speshel Comments is a periodic segment on ''Countdown'' when Keith does his best [[Zero Punctuation]] impersonation and [[nerd rage|rants for an entire 10 minutes of airtime]] about how much (INSERT [[Bush|SOME]] [[Professor Glenn Beck|RANDOM]] [[Rush Limbaugh|REPUBLICAN]] HERE) fails. Watching Olbermann special comment for prolonged periods of time has been known to cause dizziness, [[autism]], homosexuality, [[goatse]], herpes, [[furry]] lust, AIDs, and hatred for all things Republican, the latter of which he probably intends.

=== Red Eye talking about [[Ann Coulter]] trolling Olbermann ===
Keith Olbermann got all butthurt after Ann Coulter pointed out that he received his diploma from [[Bestiality|Moo School]] instead of an [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|Ivy League]] institution. He also thought that it would be a [[retard|brilliant]] idea to play "show & tell" with his diploma on national television, so that everyone could see his [[buttsecks|deep-seated]] insecurity.

=== Yes, My Show is Crap, Please kill it! ===
[[Last Thursday]], [[Fucktard|Bill O'Reilly]] started an [[Internet tough guy|online poll]] to get Olbermann's show removed from MSNBC. Olbermann completely failed to realize that O'Reilly was fucking with his [[Anontalk.com|stupid ass]] and to show his support for his favorite [[Fetish|pundit]], Olbermann and the entire staff of his show signed the petition live, on the air. Olby also took a number of jokes O'Reilly had made out of context (either because Olbermann is incapable of distinguishing [[trolling|humor]] from [[Why So Serious?|serious]] statements, or because O'Reilly simply [[unfunny|isn't funny]]).

== Kickbanned! ==
Today, Olby is up against the [[banhammer]]. [[Last Thursday]], he donated $6K to democratic candidates. As a means to prove that [[Shit nobody cares about|it isn't politically biased]], MSNBC prohibits its [[slave|workers]] from donating to political campaigns. As a result of ignoring this rule and generating ratings on par with those of ''Antiques Roadshow'', Olbermann was [[Fail|suspended without pay]]. A [[petition]] was put online shortly after he was suspended, and it eventually got over 250,000 signatures. Two days after the suspension, Olbermann was reinstated, and he came back to air a scant [[Last Thursday|four days]] after his suspension began, much to the delight of his thirty regular viewers.
