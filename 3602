HandOfZek
{{Killers}}

'''HandOfZek''' is what one might call [[emo|depressed]]. Very, very depressed. This young [[totse|totsean]] is so very, very depressed with the weight of [[life|having two children, a job, college, and a <s>girlfriend</s>]](LOL DUMPED), not to mention a few [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2051813 medical disorders] for which he gets [[at least 100]] pills for every month.

==Suicide and the Meaning of Life==

[[Last Thursday]] Zekkypoo was in contact with [[80_year_old_Chinese_man_in_panties|some girl]] with whom he shared his [[hardcore]] depressed outlook on life. After many phone conversations, he talked this girl into commiting [[An Hero|suicide]], which [[some argue]] means that Zek is an [[internet killer]].

The setup:
<pre>
 This installment is mostly about a new friend that I met in Indiana. She seemed really shy and
 withdrawn for the first few days I spent with her, but she opened up after a while of kicking
 her ass at Mortal Combat and generally enjoying her company.
</pre>
Going out in [[nazi|Jewish]] style:
<pre>
So over the next few days, we set a few things up and bought some tape to get the job done. 
I showed her how to seal up the cracks in the door/windows in her bathroom and brought some
 charcoal over for her.. barbecue.
</pre>
That first attempt [[failed]], so after he was safe and sound in [[redneck|Wyoming]], this next phone call took place.
<pre>
“Taylor, I can't do it. My mom would be devastated for losing me.”

“You can do it, just think of all the pain you're going to have to endure just to appease a
 meaningless entity. Look, I love you, and want what's best for you. I'm asking you as a friend
 to go through with the suicide and ESCAPE your imprisonment in your mind.”

She cries some more and starts a fire while I wait.

“I need you here to talk to me through the whole time, okay? Otherwise I can't do it.”

“I'm here for you, just think of how much better things will be.”

“I'm scared!”

“You're fine, just listen to my voice and calm down. Imagine you're floating away into a world
 of infinite happiness and lots of balloons.”

After 15 minutes and no reply, I hung up. This is a chapter of my life that I usually don't
 like talking about, but y;all asked for it.

I may be a horrible person, but at least I helps to ease her pain. I regret doing what I did to
 her, but her life would be shit now without me.

Did I kill her?

Please don't hate me, I only wanted to help.

==Family Values==

HOZ and his (ex)-wife have two kids (not for long), but why anyone would let these people [[fuck|reproduce]] is a question to be pondered by the ages. Their relationship has been categorized by things like [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2015273 infantalism],[http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2093682 polygamy,]

==Attention Whoring==

HandOfZek is a self admitted [[attention whore]]. He even wanted this article to be written. No srsly, check out [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2102505&page=2 the posts in this unrelated thread.] Zek loves to wallow in his own self pity and the pity of others, because he constantly [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2055114 sets himself up for failure.]

I don't know what to do. 2 weeks in, and I'm already fucked. I cannot fail anything this
 semester, and.. shit, yo. What sorts of things do y'all do to stay on top of your work and not
 fall into the warmth of laziness and failure?

I'm freaking out.

Often he will make a thread just to blatantly [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2029387 ask for attention.]

==Pastimes==
Zek enjoys [[weeaboo|anime]], something which no doubt distracts him from his family duties worse than all the [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2056938 god] [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2055982 damned] [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2055637 drugs] [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2057974 he] [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2071572 is] [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2028255 doing.] When he isnt whoring himself out for attention OL, he will sometimes start shit up [[IRL]]; [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2036219 Such a badass.]

==Broke up, kicked out, [[gay|came out.]]==
[[Last thursday]] Zek's girlfriend and mother of his children broke up with him, but for some reason [[Stupid|allowed him to live in their apartment for several months]]. Eventually she started to get [[so ronery|lonely]] due to Zek wanting to [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2125380 suck cock all the time], and decided to [[internet relationship|court]] another totsean. She actually paid for this guy to come halfway across the [[americunt|US]] to live with them and raise their children.

Soon they found that [[fail|this arrangement wouldn't work]] and Zek got [[banhammer|the boot]], and is now [http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2124819 living with] [[basement dweller|his parents,]] [[lulz]].

Hand: They ARE getting married, Hardly There is living thousands of miles away and 
Clifford is adopting my kids. 
Hand: I may never see my kids again. 
</pre>

That's right, after just a few months of knowing each other, Zek's baby momma married some '''random internet person.'''

After all this, it is expected that HandOfZek will [[an_hero|be with us no longer]] very soon. How much can one [[trap|man]] take after all?

If you'd like the full story a fine fellow on [[totse|&t]] has been documenting this whole wonderful [[lulz|lulzfest]] right [http://www.totse.com/community/usernote.php?u=149428 here!]

==[[Giant_dildo_of_death|Curtain Rods]]==

One fine day Zekkypoo was [[Mr_Hands|hankering for a penetrating]], but when his baby-momma moved away she took all their [[dildo|fun toys]] with her! Oh what is a [[trap|man]] to do?!?

<pre>
I was masturbating, and there was no dildo handy. I found a metal rod that holds up curtains,
 though, and tried to use it. Turns out, it had a sharp edge. I felt it cut me, then pulled it out
 and it cut some more. Of course, that didn't stop me from finishing.

When I was done though, I was surprised and then a little scared at how much blood had been lost
 (most soaked up with toilet paper in the bathroom).

Here's the rod, and the stain I left on my BARE MATTRESS!
</pre>

[http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2158374 You cant make this shit up.] Sadly, this isnt the first totsean to have something [[In_the_ass|penetrate his tender orifices]] and do some [[Srs_bsns|serious damage]] , [[HTS-Noob]] holds that title.
