[[Image:Fat_Bold_Rileigh.jpg|thumb|Rileigh's actual IRL picture, [http://themurlocvillage.com/forums/showthread.php?p=76853#post76853 posted by Rileigh] in an ironic attempt to prove to people on the internet he doesn't care what they think.]]

Sometimes abbreviated to ''in real life'', '''IRL''' refers to the place where IRC Admin fags suck and take huge cocks anally on a daily basis.

Used ironically or [[Sarcasm|sarcastically]] as part of Netspeak, IRL can be used to refer to any activity that can be done on [[IRC]], or in the broader sense, online.

When online, one may often hear the phrase "I IS HOT GURL IRL". When this is heard, it should not be taken seriously, as they are most likely an [[wapanese|anime fan]], [[leftard]], or [[attention whore]], or in <s>some</s> all cases a [[basement-dweller|bald fat fuck masturbating to the words on his computer screen]]. It is [[no girls on the internet|extremely unlikely that they are in actuality an attractive female]].

[http://themurlocvillage.com/forums/showthread.php?t=8139 Rileigh], a prime example of the typical, [[fat]], bald, internet attention whore [[masturbating]] over pretending to be the girl he stalks in IRL.

Although [[Internet drama]] has been spotted [[OTI|on the Internets]] since [[Al Gore]] and the Renegade master invented it in [[1984]], the [[real world]] has been filled with [[IRL drama]] for [[at least 100 years]].  And, just like [[OL]] drama spawned [[troll]]s, IRL drama has spawned the recreational activity of [[trolling IRL]].

For a good example of IRL, simply refocus your eyes to take in that which lies slightly to the left and right, as well as above and below your shiny monitor box. The initial impression is clear: dark, shabby and lacking in [[emoticons]]. Why not just blow the whole fucking [[shitload]] up? Fortunately, this idea has already been created and forwarded by one [[George W. Bush]].

Above quote demonstrates the tendency of some people to ask the question: [[philosophy|"what is IRL?"]].  These are [[faggot|curious individuals]].  If you have the time to ask such questions then you are not spending enough time worrying about the size of your [[penis]] and when you will next have the [[secks]].  The only explanation is either that you are "[[lie|secure]]" or possibly [[sick fuck|broken]].
