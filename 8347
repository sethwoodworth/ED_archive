'''The fieryangel''' was the name of a contributor to the [[Wikipedia Review]] who just showed up and started ripping [[TOW]] [[Goatse|new ones]] every day.  No one seemed to know exactly who the fieryangel was and [[transvestite|(s)he]] seemed to be a very mysterious charactor.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_major_opera_composers&diff=74785078&oldid=74784550 As much as they searched and searched, nobody could really figure out who this mysterious person was...]

But as many things are, the answer was really quite simple: the name contained the [[Fucktard|key to the mystery]].  You see, the name was the title of [[Shit nobody cares about|an opera]]

''This was to be oddly prophetic...''

==A little [[Pedobear|bedtime story]] (we hear that they like those a lot on [[TOW]]...)==

Once upon a time, [[Last Thursday]], there was a part of Wikipedia that nobody went to. This was because it was populated exclusively by [[Moreschi|screaming Opera Queens]].  Now, those of you who never go to the Opera probably don't know this, but Opera Queens are probably the bitchiest creatures on the face of this Earth. You take Joan Crawford, mix her with Bette Davis and add a swig of Rupaul and you still don't have any idea of how bitchy opera queens are.  

These creatures jealously guarded the gates of any article that had anything to do with Opera, even though everybody knows that nobody likes Opera (except for Opera queens) and they had the sacred privilege of being able to decide what was important and what was not. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_major_opera_composers/Archive1#Gustave.3F They spent their days in happy bliss making royal pronouncements about the relative "importance" (or not) of Opera composers]...''But this peaceful bliss could not last...''

==Enter The fieryangel==

It came to pass that [[Internet asshole|two voyagers]] come across the [[Wikipedia|Court of King Jimbo]] and decided to [[Spam]] the [[shit]] out of it.  This was only right and good, since [[TOW]] only exists for spam and porn (don't worry, we'll get to the ''porn'' part soon enough).   But since [[TOW]] is really a [[Jenkem|hypnotic drug]], they were seduced by this [[Cult|happy kingdom]] and decided to be good citizens of the [[Jimbo Wales|God King]]...''This was to be a fatal mistake...''

==The fieryangel meets the Screaming Opera Queens==

[[Image:Medusa by Carvaggio.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A TOW opera Queen discovers that the Sacred Word has been removed from the Sacred list!)]]

One day, the fieryangel came across the kingdom of screaming opera queens and saw a phrase that was so putrid, that he just had to change it.  This phrase was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_major_opera_composers&diff=next&oldid=74192495 ''the lavish spectacle of the intermedi'']. Now, if you're normal, you're probably thinking "So what.  That phrase sucks.  Get rid of it".  

But you're forgetting that you don't ever, ''''''EVER'''''', cross an opera queen, not if you want to live to tell about it.  You don't touch '''ONE WORD''' of the  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_opera_composers '''Sacred'''][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_operas '''Opera'''] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_opera_corpus '''Lists'''] which must be kept pure for all eternity to forever honor the name of our King Jimbo the 1st, forever and ever AMEN. And if the phrase ''the lavish spectacle of the intermedi'' is ever removed from  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_opera_composers this list], the World shall disappear in a clap of thunder and everything shall vanish.  You don't even think of redirecting these articles to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_big_bust_models_and_performers something more interesting]!  Or you shall be forever destroyed and thrown into [[Hell]] for all eternity

So when the word ''lavish'' was removed, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_major_opera_composers/Archive2#Peacock_terms a catfight] of biblical proportions was unleashed upon the fieryangel.

After a serious bout of scratching and clawing, peace once again reigned on the kingdom of the Opera Queens...''but there was trouble on the horizon...:''

[[Image:TITS.jpg|thumb|right|Definitely NOT on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_opera_composers list of Major Opera Composers], but almost certainly on [[JzG]]'s [[Ipod]]...]]
You see, the fieryangel had [[Drama|discovered the opera queens dirty secret]]:  their sacred list was [[Bullshit|completely unsourced]] and [[You fail it|totally failed NPOV]] and had to be [[baleet]]ed.  The Opera queens ran screaming to [[Arbcom]] and got the fieryangel [[b&|bumped off the site]]...(well, not exactly, but that would have happened eventually because '''OPERA QUEENS NEVER FORGET!!!''') However, it so happened that [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Jean-Thierry_Boisseau&diff=208851981&oldid=80397401 JzG made a rather stupid statement about what was not on his Ipod], which lead the [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=12274 Wikipedia Review to discover what '''was''' on his Ipod]...

So the Fieryangel put on his boogie shoes and hightailed it out of there before the screaming opera queens could tear him apart.  He went to [[Wikipedia Review|the land where people wail and gnash their teeth]] and where the sacred [[Kool-aid]] may not be served!
