The [[YouTube]] Street Team knows all. When you make a phone call, YouTube Street Team has a tracer on it. When you make a page on [[ED]], YouTube Street Team knows about it by way of its high-tech [[Ted Stevens|tube]]-sensitators, and is thus prepared to immediately forward this information to [[PixelBee|Sgt. Smith]] of the [[serious business|police department]]. The YouTube Street Team has [[internet tough guy|connections to the NSA]]. When [[you]] sleep, YouTube Street Team watches you and touches itself.

Beyond that, [[noone]] really knows what the YouTube Street Team is, other than that it was once controlled by [[dragon|dragon enthusiast]] and possible Jew [[Argent009]], and that it is now under the leadership of Internet scammer and [[CP]] collector [[Damienestreich | Damien Estreich]].

The YouTube Street Team was heavily involved in the [[YouTube Civil War of 2006]].
