Voluntary Human Extinction Movement
[[Image:Vhemt.gif|thumb|Because the world would be a better place without us.]]
The [[An hero|'''Voluntary Human Extinction]] Movement''' is a group and website run by [[batshit crazy]] [[liberal]] [[hippie]]s who like to celebrate [[human]] [[life]]. Indeed, their motto is "May we live [[long]] and [[die]] out." Being the nice, kind, people that they are, the VHEM call for people to live for [[at least 100 years]], with maximum satisfaction in life, as long as they don't have any [[children]]. This makes [[Pedobear]] very, very angry. However, it is known that due to the fact that humans cannot resist giving into their [[rape|urges]], many VHEM members have created [[Josef Fritzl|rape dungeons]] in secret, where they breed like rabbits with a [[16-year-old girl]] that they grabbed off the streets against her will. If other VHEM members find out about these, they are ejected from the cult, but that's a blessing in disguise, kinda like realizing that [[recent changes patrol]] on [[Wikipedia]] wasn't that much fun anyway.

It is not known whether the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement disapproves of having sex outright, but since [[Catholic]]s cannot use [[condom|contraception]] unless it's the rhythm method which is a notoriously [[failure]] at not making babies, it is not popular in many parts of [[Europe]]. However, the people of the pussy liberal [[Protestant]] countries of [[Scandinavia]] embrace such ideas, because they celebrate cultural [[suicide]] by allowing [[Islam]]ic immigrants to [[Rape|treat]] their native people like second-class citizens. This is in contrast with the right-wing government of [[Italy]], which has enough sense to see that bulldozing mosques is a good thing and is [[lulz|funny]], so we can laugh at Muslims being denied their dream of [[Eurabia]]. This is relevant because Arab and [[niggers|other dark-skinned ''Homo sapiens'']] would be the last people to join such a shitty cult as the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement because they like to produce approximately 7.8 children per [[woman]], and ED actually thinks that this is one area in which these people can see sense.

[[Image:Whybreed.jpg|thumb|left|This shit is worse than [[Wikipedia]], [[Scientology]] and [[Chick Tract|Jack Chick]]. Combined. Notice how [[Godwin's Law]] is shown true in this comic strip, because the VHEM are such low, vile scum as to compare their opponents to [[Nazi]]s, which is one of the oldest tricks in the book.]]
[[Image:Paternalinstinct.gif|thumb|left|As with other such cults, the VHEM resorts to such low, sleazy tactics as attempting to subtly have a go at the [[intelligence]] of anyone who questions them by comparing [[breeder]]s to Neanderthals. But don't worry, because their [http://www.rickross.com/warningsigns.html dogma] is nothing to be scared of.]]

[[Image:Pedobear too-old692.jpg|thumb|left|Pedobear is disappointed with the VHEM. He's not [[Death List|supercentenarian]]-loving bear, is he? After all, the VHEM hold nothing against having a [[old|long life]].]]
The philosophy of the VHEM is fairly clear, but still completely [[retarded]]. Because these pussies feel [[liberal guilt]] and white privilege about living in a country with a high Human Development Index, they think it is [[USI|their job]] to take on the task of reversing the effects of [[global warming]]. A leading [[faggot|anthropologist]] recently stated that if [[incest|insects]] were to die out, the effects on the global ecosystem would be massively damaging and irreversible, but if humans were to die out, the rest of the [[animal]]s wouldn't even [[shit nobody cares about|give a fucking shit]], and they wouldn't have to face volcanic fireballs spitting from the earth's surface caused by the acceleration of ice cap melt and depletion of the ozone layer, which only just gets worse and worse with time, or so the [[conspiracy]] theory goes. Come on, do it for the [[animal]]s! [[lies|They're so much more important than us]]!

As [[you]] can see, their [[self-hatred]] is pretty [[lulz]]worthy, and would be ripe for [[trolling]] if they had [[forum]]s. It should also be noted that [[racist|white supremacists]] on [[Stormfront]] think that the VHEM is yet another Jew conspiracy to destroy the [[white people|white race]], because the only languages that the website is available in are the European ones, despite the fact that it includes almost every European language, even Belorussian. Whilst this is quite a [[duckroll|farfetched]] theory and Stormfront is full of neo-[[Nazi]]s whose views often use highly questionable logic and seek to blame people other races for their own [[fail]]ings, it is considerably less crazy than the VHEM itself. Since the population growth in European countries amongst native people is tiny, and indeed often below replacement rate, compared to those of third-world nations whose [[economy|economies]] are apparently growing just as rapidly as their populations (look at the current price of [[oil]] and the new demand for it in [[Asia]]), the VHEM would be better targeting those people. One way to do this would be by using [[Wikipedia]], and teaching [[the child in Africa]] that wanting not to have children is a good thing, so that it might become cynical at realizing how fucking [[batshit crazy]] some of the people in the Western world really are.

Well, could you pass a minimal intelligence test if one were required for a "[[eugenics|license to breed]]"?

To find out, simply answer this question:

In light of the [[lulz|40,000 children dying of malnutrition each day]], and [[shit nobody cares about|considering the number of species going extinct]] as a result of our [[orgy|excessive reproduction]], do you think [[yes|it would be a good idea to create another of yourself]]?}}

If you answer "yes", it says:

{{quote|[[cool story bro|We're sorry, your intelligence is not high enough to perform basic logic]].

Thank you for trying.

[[BAWWWWW|Please consider the many options to creating "one of your own"]].}}

But if you answer "no", it says:

{{quote|Congratulations!
[[bullshit|You're smart enough to pass on your genes]].

Thanks for not doing so.}}

This [[shit]] is worse than [[Scientology]]! It does not allow its members to even question the quite obviously flawed logic that this uses, which basically assumes that [[the child in Africa]] is equivalent to one of [[Madeleine McCann|your children]] in terms of how important it is to the world, and not only has such equality never existed, it never fucking will. As long as people in the third world are not educated about the effects of [[AIDS]] and their rampant breeding upon the world's capacity to sustain its population, things will never change. These starving children are bred only to work on the farmland when in the Sahel in the southern Sahara it's all turning to fucking desert anyway. Excuse me, but you'd have to be the biggest fucking dumbass in the world to believe that [[money]] is not more important than human life, especially that of [[the child in Africa]].

The VHEM really, really makes [[tool]]s of its members. A good way to [[IRL]] troll the VHEM is to have multiple wives, and have ten children with each one. Some [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] users wish that 90% of men were [[gay]] so they could have 10 wives, because for most men who are not [[faggot]]s, [[pedophile]]s, [[furries]] or pussy [[liberal]] fucks like these dipshits, there is nothing more pleasurable than having sex with as many women as possible, often at the same time. For an [[epic win]], you could make a series of porno movies of it and send them to VHEM members' homes.

[[TL;DR]] Don't believe the brainwashing that these [[cunt]]s are trying to impose on [[gullible]], [[you|vulnerable people]].
