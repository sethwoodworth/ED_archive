ED Improvement Drive
{{notice|[[TL;DR]]? '''See [[Exhibit A|BAD ARTICLE]] vs. [[NAFTA|GOOD ARTICLE]].}}
It has become apparent that, in full accordance with [[Godwin's Law#Sturgeon's Law|Sturgeon's Law]] and [[Hamtaro's Theory]], [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] has [[ED:Address to the State|become infested with shit]], and there has even been discussion about [[delete fucking everything|nuking it all]].

With this in mind, it is now necessary for Encyclopedia Dramatica to do some [[DAMN NIGGA]]. During this time, we will be seriously locking down on the creation of new articles, and users who prove themselves to be fucking [[retards]] may very well be [[banhammer|banned]] without warning. Now is not the time to create an article on some random asshole (see:[[Exhibit B]]) from some random website who is asserted to be [[gay]]. Now is not the time to blindly smear pages with memes. Now is not the time to slap a bunch of faggy templates around (see: [[Exhibit A]]).

We seek to accomplish the massive reduction of [[faggotry]], the deletion of [[shit]], and the increase of [[lulz]]. With that in mind, here are some of our specific goals:

#The removal (or at least complete rewrite) of articles that are entirely or almost entirely unrelated to the internet. These include, but are not limited to, most articles on bands, television shows, movies, and IRL locations.
#Significant quality control exercised over our [[Special:Popularpages|most popular articles]] which have gone downhill / were never good in the first place. 
#A reduction of shitty attack pages. Encyclopedia Dramatica exists to document internet drama, culture, memes, and people, but the internets are a [[xbawks|fucking hueg]] place, and unless the subject of an article is actually somewhat notable and/or interesting in the communities they are involved with, [[Noone]] gives a shit.
#A general improvement in article quality. Too many newfags come to ED with the belief that we are nothing more than a racist, sexist, and homophobic [[Uncyclopedia|Unfunnypedia]]. This is not the case. This site actually contains lulz, [[Uncyclopedia|Unfunnypedia]] contains [[You]].
#Improvements to the [[ED:SG|style guide]].
#Start articles in your userspace first.  Start in <nowiki>User:USERNAME/*ARTICLE NAME*</nowiki> (subject to Sysop approval). 
#Mandatory use of [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]] to EDit due to superior spellcheck capacity.
