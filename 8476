Too cool for the Internet
[[File:Too-cool-Im-too-cool-for-this-internet-shit.jpg|thumb|]]
'''Too cool for the internet''' is a bit of an abstract concept that can mean many things, but it is typically where someone basically tries to act as if or implies that they are somehow "above" being on the internet, or to further elaborate, it is also often used in forums as a last resort or defense mechanism by [[butthurt]] [[deep thinker|pseudo-intellectuals]], regs, [[prommie]]s, or anybody else suffering from [[unwarranted self importance]] and [[unrealistic expectations]] in a futile, pathetic attempt to have the last word in an argument or try to make it appear as if they're somehow better than you after you've completely [[pwn]]ed the living hell out of them. It is also a mindset as well, among other manifestations.

Older politicians sometimes engage in a variation of this, '''too important for the internet'''. Usually, deep inside they know this isn't true, and have their staff perform the internet functions for them.

== Too cool for the internet as a defense mechanism ==
[[File:Too cool internet.gif|thumb|The truth for most of [[you]].]]

'''A typical scenario involving "too cool for the internet" being used as a retort or defense mechanism will typically go something like this:'''

* A poster innocently posts something on a forum, with no intentions of anything but simply discussing it in a friendly manner. It can be a post about anything from music, art, cars, animals, 'dry' humping, or whatever.

* Another poster, usually an [[internet tough guy]], forum reg, [[16 year old girl]], prommie, or any other [[fucktard]] suffering from [[unwarranted self importance]] feels utterly compelled to start shit with the other poster by needlessly [[flaming]] or in cases of more [[pretentious]] asshats, starting a [[arguing on the internet|debate]] for no other reason other than just to start shit, and because they [[stupid|think they can get away with it]].

* Then, the original poster [[win|completely derails the attackers argument]] with the [[fact]]s, tears them a new [[asshole]], or otherwise just makes them look like the dumbass or dumbasses that they really are.

* Finally, the prommie, [[smugfag|pretentious pseudo intellectual]] or moron sees that he or she has been completely obliterated, backed into a corner, and made a fool of. With no way to win, they will usually respond with something laughable like "[[LOL]], yOUve gOt 2 muCh timE on yEr hAndS wELL wAs fUn dEstroYinG U bUt iVe gOt tO gEt rEady fOr woRk nOw" in a pathetic attempt to make it look like you were [[u mad|taking things too seriously]], to make themselves look like the victor, or to create the illusion that they have a [[irl|life]] when in reality they're a [[basement dwelling]] [[neckbeard]] with [[no friends]] that is probably crying, and their only "job" is giving their [[fat|500 pound]] mom her daily spongebath.

Extra [[lulz]] for you if after leaving their supposed [[fail|final post]] and "heading off to work or to a party" that you respond to the post and destroy them even further, and then they come right back and start attempting to argue again, despite the fact that they supposedly have [[basement dweller|a job]], [[mai waifu|a girlfriend]], and [[irl|a life]]. Calling them out on this is even funnier. Be warned though, you will likely be blocked or if they happen to be a [[internet celebrity|popular]] member of the forum, you will likely be [[banned]]. What better way for them to show you that [[irony|"thEy dOnt cAre aNd thEy hAve a LIfE"]], right?

==Too cool for the internet as a mindset==
[[File:Guido 08.jpg|thumb|Yes, going to a shitty club with these morons would be a ''much'' more productive way to spend your spare time.]]
Too cool for the internet is also a mindset shared by many a dumbass both [[online]] and [[IRL]] who delude themselves into thinking that they're "too good" to have anything to do with something as [[nerd]]y as the [[internet]]. They don't ''need'' the internet. Unlike the rest of us, they ''have'' a life. This type of thinking is most common in [[16 year old girls]], [[AOL]] [[chatroom]] members, and [[old people]] who believe that anyone and everyone on the internet ''must'' be a [[child molester]] or a [[you|morbidly obese 45 year old virgin that lives in his mother's basement]] by default.

That fact of the matter is that the majority of these people with this attitude are [[retarded]] in reality, and have absolutely nothing going for them. They just believe whatever the TV tells them or whatever their dumbass friends think. In their expected stupidity and total cluelessness, they think that going out and [[whore|getting impregnated by random guys]] is somehow more productive than enjoying a night of [[lulz]] on good ol' [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. It's even funnier because [http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61I5CW20100219 recent studies and findings show that using the internet is actually making people smarter, despite what old people, 16 year old girls, and other dumbasses seem to think.]

==Too cool for the internet as an excuse for being a complete asshole==

[[Lulz]] are all in good fun, but sometimes it's just [[too soon]]. Most often used by [[troll]]s, [[gaiafags]], and anybody else who wants an excuse to torment people behind the protection of a computer screen for fear of being beaten to a pulp if they were to say such things in real life. They mean to imply that by getting even the ''slightest'' bit upset over the fact that they were mocking the recent death of your entire immediate family in a tractor trailer accident, you are "taking the internet way too seriously" and have [[Irony|"no life."]] It is also meant to try and alleviate any semblance of a conscience that they may have left after experiencing the bitterness of a completely failed life and perpetual [[perma-virgin]] status.
