[[Image:Krispy.jpg|thumb|Considered racist]]
'''kkk_membership''' was a [[fake journal]], the brain child of uniquely common previously known as the [[permabanned]] [[brainlesswonder]], one of the first people to bring [[serial adding]] to the mainstream. While several serial adders have been documented by [[LJ Drama]] before, kkk_membership brought the issue into the [[LJ]] spotlight with constant [http://www.livejournal.com/community/lj_biz/210696.html complaints] and [http://www.livejournal.com/community/lj_biz/220781.html?thread=5901933 whining] to [[brad]] and essentially forced [[LJ]] to rework their [[friends list]] code, having the special honor of being the first subject of the [http://www.livejournal.com/community/lj_biz/218340.html?thread=5002468 GoatVote system].

For future use, here is the award winning [[serial adder]] recipe.
# Make offensive journal name about the [[DAMN NIGGA]]
# Make the journal about non-offensive material such as Krispy Kreme Donuts
# Start adding people to your friends list that will be offended by the name and the harmless content.
#* [[Diabeetus|Diabetics]]
#* [[Eating disorder]]s

# [[Google]] journal name and proceed to add everyone on the [[friends list]] of those who complain about being added.
# Create off-site web page to list links to the journals of all that complain.
# Allow people to get off the friends list by signing a waiver saying that they actually do not like Krispy Kreme Donuts, and submitting their request in [[poem]] form.
# Allow people to vote on the winning poetry.
# Steal icon for journal from member of anti [[icon]] theft community. '''Very Important'''


KKK stands for ''Krispy Kreme Kicksass''.
