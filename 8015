Tales from the "Liberry"
[[Image:Carolsatan1.jpg|thumb|A note from Mrs. Carol Satan.]]

Most people who have ever learnt to read know that there are two types of librarian: hot, young [[geek]] [[girl|girls]] who want to engage in hot [[sex]] behind the library stacks (mostly found in universities), and old, angry prudes who hate everybody who visits the library (mostly in your local dump). Most prudes are content with simply telling their patrons to [[stfu]]. However, one such prude has taken his frustration public by writing '''[http://liberry.blogspot.com ''Tales from the "Liberry"'']'''. Upon inspection, one is forced to ask, "Why doesn't this guy just find another job?"  Which was answered recently when he was [[LOL|fired]] from the "liberry."
