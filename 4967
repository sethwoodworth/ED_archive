Lord Rexington Fear
[[Image:RexFear1.jpg|thumb|right|Praying for dignity]]
'''Lord Rexington Fear''' is a [[basement-dweller|basement-dwelling]] wannabe [[hipster]] living in Queens, noted for his obsessively updated [http://lordrexfear.livejournal.com LiveJournal], his run-ins with PoE editor [[kthor]], and the [[goatse|gaping chasm]] between his [http://lordrexfear.livejournal.com/611405.html supreme self-regard] and the actual mediocrity of every aspect of his life. His name is a portmanteau of Teddy Ruxpin and Paddington Bear.  Despite being 29, his interests are those of a [[13 year old boy]] - childrens' cartoons, pro [[wrestling]], [[comic]] books, and [[plastic crap]].  He is one of [[Portal of Evil]]'s most consistent [[lol_cow|lol cows]]. Rexy still lives with his parents (again, he's 29); his employment history contains such humiliating events as wearing a "Funshine Carebear" suit for a "Carebears meet-and-greet" and being fired from a mall cookie stand. His hopeless attempts at creativity, such as the classic [http://alienjack.com/audio/Swiggity_Sweet_Sweet.mp3 Swiggity Sweet Sweet (warning: sound)] rap, are pure lol.

==Drama==

Rex Fear tried for years to worm his way into New York's [[fan art|alternative comics]] scene, but succeeded only in enraging everyone with his [[fat|fatness]], creepiness, and a distinct odor of old meat. Matters finally came to a head when he clumsily hit on an well-known artist's girlfriend, and posted about the incident on his [[LiveJournal]] after the inevitable [[fail]]. Kthor preserved three pages of the [http://www.shortandhappy.com/fatrexfear.htm succulent drama], plus vintage Rex photos. At the subsequent [[con|Small Press Expo]] where Kthor and Cheese had a booth, Rexington showed up with a [http://www.poetv.com/video.php?vid=6282 knife] to "protect himself", and threatened various people. 

Kthor responded by organizing [http://www.sixsixfive.com/600.html Dare You Enter the World of Fear]. Rex was then made a Portal of Evil exhibit.


==Artistic Failures==
[[Image:RexFear2.jpg|thumb|right|This looks all [[buttsecks|deep]] and artsy and shit... right guys?]]
Rex's attempts at drawing comics are utter [http://www.tencentticker.com/msgbrd/viewtopic.php?t=202 shit], obviously. 


Rex's attempts at making music are utter [http://www.popculturespectrum.com/lordrexfear.html shit], obviously.

Rex's attempts at writing poetry are utter, well, [http://friends.portalofevil.com/sp.php?si=3&fi=000019040&ti=1000502330&pi=1000502330 yeah]


He somehow succeeded in getting drunk off of 22 ounces of St. Ives, and then recorded [http://friends.portalofevil.com/sp.php?si=3&fi=000019040&ti=1000587753&pi=1000588184 battle raps].

More desperate [http://friends.portalofevil.com/sp.php?si=3&fi=000019040&ti=1000493784&pi=1000493784 ranting] about how powerful and special he is.

==Fatness==
[[Image:RexFearBeach.jpg|thumb|right|The Man in Full]]
Lord Rexington Fear is [[fat|not thin]]. He resembles a manatee made of dough and hair. A ''short'' manatee. When he walks, his gut billows out before him like a greasy spinnaker of flesh, and he [[McDonald's|somehow]] manages to have love handles both around his waist and under his armpits. Despite being a plague on anything near him with eyes, he writes completely unironic essays in his LiveJournal about how [[sexy]] he considers himself.

Lord Rexington Fear (note the [[Waaaambulance|rude and improper shortening of his name by previous editor]]) is a man among men. He has a love for fan art and alternative comics, and unfortunately some anal individuals that are full of their selves (par and partial for the alternate comics world) see no need to respect a fellow human being.
<br>
Lord Rexington Fear's exploits go beyond enraging NY's Alt Comics scene, he is a caring, kind person, that while occasionally burdened by the pressures of society to fit in commits actions that isolate him further, but make him endearing.
Hell, think of the time it took for the haters to create so much angst against someone, by the original editor's words, isn't worth the time.
<br>
There lies the beauty, the splendor, and the majesty of Lord Rexington Fear.
<br><br>

Some people love ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', other lambaste it and hold the original Star Trek as sacred. Some people think Sushi is the greatest food ever, other prefer chili. Some people won't eat meat and find its consumption appalling, others love to tear into cooked flesh.
<br>
Lord Rexington Fear thrived and tried, and unfortunately lacked the support to take his grand visions for a comic opus to the next level.
<br><br>
Before anorexia became the norm thanks to Paris and Nicole, [[fat|weight]] was something to be proud of. To possess a beer gut denoted your drinking prowess. Only idiots and morons don't realize the power of weight, the [[no|joys of getting lost in love handles]], or the power that can be brought to bear when someone possesses the fighting prowess and training of Lord Rexington Fear.

== Rexy shows his tiny penis to the world ==
On October 30,2008, a valiant troll managed to get pictures of Lord Rexington Fear naked. LRF has a really shitty webcam,and was unable to take a full body picture for ED.

== Earlier Cockshots ==
[[Image:Rexdate1.jpg|thumb|right|Rex awaits his blind date, not realizing she's standing nearby.]]
But prior to that, a bunch of [[Portal of Evil]] [[oldfags]] with too much time on their hands conducted the most disturbing sting operation of all time, convincing Rexy that he was going to meet a hot New Jersey stripper named Lisa and have all sorts of deviant sex with her. Not only did this result in horrifying nudes (seen below), but even more horrifying pictures of the brave PoEtard "running into" Rexy while he was waiting patiently outside of the Virgin Megastore for his dreamgirl to arrive. The whole story is contained in about a zillion [[tl;dr]] chatlogs [http://www.shortandhappy.com/rexlog1.htm here] (change the number in the URL for moar) but you just want to look at pictures of a fat fuck with his clothes off, so go wild.

==Classic Quotes==
[[image:Rexy.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Click this picture for an ''extra special'' Rex quote]]
[[image:SexyRexy.jpg|right|thumb| i wonder how she stands his constant stench of urine,vomit and rotten meat. Bad smell fetish,perhaps?]]
"When trying to do my own stuff all I've accomplished RECENTLY is recording a track based on a legally allowed under amount seconds looped remix of Star Wars music over heavy breathing that is supposed to represent Darth Vader going insane"

"Is Lindsay Lohan a cow (in the BEST sexiest way)?"

"I want my nipples suckled; I want to have my bellybutton sucked as it was a bowl of ice cream. So, if your man is as sensuous and appreciative of full contact love as I am, go all out. Rub the hairs on his chest as you slide your lips around his erect male nipple. Treat his belly button as it was an endless supply of brownies that can’t get you fat."
