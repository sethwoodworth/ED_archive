[[The Incredible Hulk]] is a Marvel comic, conceived by Stan Lee one night while fucking Jack Kirby's wife. The comic revolves around the adventures of Bruce [[Banhammer|Banner]], a crazy scientist who accidentally blows himself up with a gamma bomb. But instead of rightfully fracturing into [[over 9000|a million]] pieces, he transforms into a huge green [[otherkin|monstrosity]].

The Hulk is the very  reason why people shouldn't take steroids.

Hulk is, apparently, the only good guy that can be a badguy simultaneously, as he has an extreme habit of going [[batshit|apeshit]] whenever [[faggotry]] arises (and [[faggotry]] ALWAYS has a habit of arriving).

When not the Hulk, Banner is completely [[emo]], constantly whining about the fact that he can't stick [[cock|it]] in his former flame Betty Ross' pooper as either Banner or the Hulk. As Banner he is impotent and as the Hulk he would fuck her into another galaxy. In fact, the only hero who could survive Hulk's fucking is his cousin, She-Hulk, which is why the comic is so popular in [[Indiana]].

At one point, [[Iron Man|Iron Dick]] got drunk off his ass and shot Hulk into space. It's the collective opinion of everyone that Earth is fucked when Hulk gets back.
When he actually DOES get back, he beats the fuck out of everybody and forces them to fight in a gigantic arena until a [[batshit]] [[Superman]] ripoff hits him until he explodes.
Despite Bruce Banner being a scientist, the Hulk is a gigantic fucktard.

==Film==

A film was made of the Hulk to net the greedy [[Jews]] at Marvel their precious gold. They decided to use an [[azn]] director to cut costs. For a character based entirely around smashing things, the movie consisted of very little smashing. They actually tried to focus on [[Shit nobody cares about|story]], and some boring shit about [[lol|child abuse]]. Because of this, nobody saw it and the director was deported back to China. He later returned to make movies about [[Brokeback Mountain|gay cowboys eating pudding.]]

A second <del>movie</del> pile of fail is being made with different actors and different plot. Hopefully it will include more smashing and less faggotry. Hulk will be stomping on a monster named "Abomination" in the new movie. All ED knows about Abomination comes from the bible: Leviticus 20:13 "And a man who lies with a male as one would with a woman both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon themselves." Ergo, Abomination is a fag.
Abomination will be a prissy, effeminate queer. The movie will start with Abomination "hitting" on the Hulk at a bar. But the Hulk ain't no fag, so he spends two hours trying to kill him in this long, digitized fight scene. Hulk is anger unleashed you know. Unbound madness. By the end of the movie, that guy from American History X they got to play the Hulk will walk out of the film with some blonde girl with big tits. (This was all in the original script--but there is no telling what the newfags did to it since it's not out in teh theater yet.)

New film is out. There's a second Hulk antagonist. He's naked, but has ken doll like genitals. He should have a huge hulk penis. He should smash shit with it.
