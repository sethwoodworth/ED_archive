ThunderRoo

There comes a time in every man's life when he must leave the earthy comfort of damp, darkness and smell of his own farts that is his parents basement and seek daylight, a job and a life. Even furfags eventually tire of badly drawn animal dongs and long to experience the real thing with other like-minded individuals.

[[Ironically]] this is one of the few recorded cases in history where a furfag had voluntarily left his comfortable home life and his parents - possibly out of shame - dragged him back kicking and screaming. Little did they know the [[cult]] of the furry community would unleash the furry fury.

==Freedom!==

[[Sarcasm|Life as a closet marsupial who yearns to be fucked in the ass by a cartoon animal is a burden many share]]. In the case of our heroic manchild, the hardships were compounded by living in a Mormon household. The first glimmer of freedom in our young adventurer's eye can be seen in his elation at being able to finally make fun of the ethnic groups he despised in High School.

Dearly needing to find a plance where nobody would point and laugh at him, Thunderro sought solace on the internet and quickly found a possible job.

==Tragedy Strikes!==
Upon finding out their son was a [[furry]] any other normal family would have disowned their bastard spawn and decapitated any remaining offspring to avoid the same mistake happening again. But his was no normal family - the same sick, twisted genes which turned him into a [[furry]] were inherited from his sick, twisted father who decided to try and lure his perverted son home.

Upon realizing that their mentally deranged child had fled its cage to freedom and furfaggotry across the country. His family concocted an elaborate plot to recapture the abomination and get it off the internet. Elaborate enough to trick someone who thinks they're a [[fuck|fucking]] Kangaroo anyway.

Resorting to desperate measures, the boy's father sent him a false text saying he had been in a car crash and had been hospitalized. Terrified that the family's savings would be spent on health care rather than appropriating the money to buy a new fursuit, Thunderoo rushed home to see his father.

This whole affair was common knowledge among the furfags in Thunderoo's clique. But it was not until fellow furfag ScottJFox [[twitter|tweeted]] Thunderoo did the realization that not all was as it seemed ...

==Furfags to the Rescue!==

Thunderoo - a 19 year old boy - was now safely back at home with his family. As punishment for travelling to the other side of America to meet a complete stranger without warning his family that he was leaving, they suspended his phone privilages and deleted his [[Twitter]] account so for once in his life he would get off the fucking internet.

Horrified that the evil [[mundanes]] had taken one of their own the [[furry]] community struck back. The terror of thinking his parents may try to find help for their pathetic walking abortion was matched by the furious clicking of keyboards - if [[Chris-chan|they had already cut down his internets]] they were capable of anything.

Details of the resuce itself are sketchy, and only Scott J Fox gives his side of the story:

{{squote|To make a very long story short, ThunderRoo is 19 years of age. He had moved out, and his parents lied to forcefully bring him back to and attempt to keep him in California. DragonOrca and I left shortly after to pick him up from his place. [[Bullshit|What his parents did was illegal]]. There was no “car accident” and his father was not severely hospitalized. Thankfully, no violence came of this. ThunderRoo left his home and headed to a local church, where DragonOrca and I picked him up. Drove home stopping for food, and as of now he’s [[Buttsex|sleeping safe and sound]].|}}

It appears that his evil and lying parents were simply presuaded into giving up their child by a stranger showing up at their door. Burying their hands in their faces to hide the tears, they finally accepted their son was no longer human and handed him over to the strange beast-man, to live a life of being sodomised by 40-year old men dressed as [[FYIAD|dragons]] and raping dogs.

==Furry Fandom = Cult==
The sad story of Thunderroo is not merely about a father losing his son to a club of obese fox-wannabes. It is proof that the furry fandom is officially a [[cult]].
This may sound like an exaggeration until you realize Thunderroo was willing to travel to the other side of the [[USA]] to meet a stranger who specifically asked for a gay worker without telling his parents - and when his parents took him back the furries considered this 'kidnapping'.
