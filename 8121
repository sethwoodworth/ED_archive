'''The Forum''', or originally, The [[Stile Project|StileProject Forums,]] is a poorly conceived [[Forum|message board]] vomited upon the internet by stile in an attempt to centralize a spot online for his many [[Cock|users]] to congregate, exchange ideas, and to generally converse about the state of the whole stileNET group of sites.  While these endeavors might seem noble on the face of things, what the Forum became was a cesspool of [[Drama|drama,]] infighting, [[Internet stalking|stalking,]] and [[Butthurt|butthurt.]]  Add a nice helping of [[Crap|scat porn]] to all this and you get a very precise picture of what the Forum is.

[[Some argue|Originally,]] the stileproject forums were on an old-style ez board.  When [[Internet celebrity|Jay Stile]] realized he couldn't smother that type of messageboard system with his brand of porn ads and other [[spam]], he quickly figured out that he would have to get his own messageboard [[Warez|software.]]  He then purchased a version of vBull and the [[RAGE|games]] truly began.  [[Douchebag|Vistors]] of the old vBull board were greeted with scat porn, [[Old|octogenarian porn,]] and much of the other [[lulz|sick fuckery]] that the main site had been long associated with, right from the [[Billy Mays|ad banners]] down. In depth perusal of the many sub-forums, comparable to a descent through the rings of the Nine Hells or a night out in [[Britfag|Manchester]], takes the valued member on a thrilling trip through [[Goatse]], a lingering glance at [[Tubgirl]], and the various [[Shit nobody cares about|vitriol]] that a messageboard of this standard is usually associated with.  This was the case for several years until Stile decided to move the whole kit and kaboodle over to a shiny new domain called "theforum.com."  Since then, [[Menopause|things have gone downhill.]]

== '''Description''' ==

The Forum has changed very little over the years.  It is a [[Weblog|web page]] with a black person background and has gray/white stripes in an up and down broken pattern (also known as “film back”).  The links are in a bright [[Homosexuality|teal color.]]  About the only thing that has varied over the more than ten years that the stile forum has been around is the [[Fan art|logo.]]  Little more can be said of the general layout of the Forum except that it looks as if it were designed by an [[Emo|emo faggot]] who does little more than download [[Vomit|vomit porn]] and [[Furry|homosexually molest his cat all day long.]]  I mean seriously…[[AIDS|teal?]]

== '''Inner Workings''' ==

[[Image:Cap7.jpg|thumb|right|175px|thanks for the heads up...kevin]]
[[Image:Cap8.jpg|thumb|right|175px|i can't believe its not butter]]


While the general layout of the forum is drab, [[Boring|boring,]] and [[Old people|old,]] it is the inside of the Forum where the [[Asperger's syndrome|real magic]] goes on.   Magic, in this case, is described as [[Old people|“people who have been around on the same forum for a long time and are generally a lazy group of fucktards.”]]   When a group has been together for this length of time, they generally get to know one another’s foibles and [[Drama|idiosyncrasies.]]   This, in itself is not very interesting, but when a person takes a closer look at this [[Fag|“tight knit” group,]] they will find that the Forum members are mostly [[Unfunny|unfunny]] assholes or [[Basement-dweller|basement dwellers]] with no hope of ever getting [[Virgin|laid.]]  The same [[Shit nobody cares about|arguments]] spread themselves out over years and years of [[Troll|trolling]] and [[Trolls Trolling Trolls|counter-trolling.]]


== '''Subforums''' ==

[[Image:Cap0001.jpg|center|thumb|175px|a sub forum of a sub forum of a sub forum...]]

[[Image:Cap11.jpg|thumb|right|175px|THE RULES.]]
[[Image:Mem3.jpg|thumb|175px|wow, real pornstars post there!]]
[[Image:Mem4.jpg|thumb|175px|wow, real faggots post there!]]
[[Image:Mem5.jpg|thumb|175px|shit bats!]]

[[Image:Mem7.jpg|thumb|175px|that's more like it!]]
[[Image:Mem8.jpg|thumb|175px|oh snap!]]

These tired old trolls take place on the Forum’s 18 sub-forums: 

*'''General Mayhem''' – the original forum.  This is where you can [[Stupid|post just about anything]] you want and several people will [[Debate|discuss]] it with you.

*'''Random Media''' – [[Pain series|this is where you put all the gross pictures, videos, and sound clips you can find on the internet.  At some point, Stile will find these links and “miraculously” they will become new content for his main site.  Also, porn that nobody faps to can be found here.]]

*'''Porno Paradise''' – this is where all the [[Pr0n|porn]] that people actually fap to is found.

*'''Webmaster Chat''' – Have a website you want to show off?  Do you need some advice on how to set up a server?  Want to show off your web skills?  Boy, this sure isn’t the place to do it.  [[Expert|Webmaster]] Chat is more of a place where you can join other people’s porn [[Links|top lists.]]

*'''Technology''' – This is where the [[Nigga Know Technology|PC and Mac fanboys]] do battle. The posters there put up idiotic questions or extremely complicated ones...no middle ground. Whatever the topic, it usually ends with the "[[Computer|PC]] better than [[Apple|Mac]]" (or vice-versa) or a browser [[Whine|whine-fest.]]  The tech forum is also a place to post anything [[Science|science related.]]  If you were to post something like NEW NANOTECH [[Quasidan's penis|BONAR TECHNOLOGIES]] in General Mayhem, you’d be a [[X Y is X|troll, or get trolled.]]

*'''[[Television|TV]] and [[2girls1cup|Movies]]''' – A great place to sit down, get comfortable, and have some [[13-year-old boy|15 year-old]] tell you that your taste in movies sucks.

*'''Music''' – A great place to sit down, get comfortable, and have some [[13-year-old boy|13-year-old]] tell you that your [[Raver|taste in music sucks.]]

*'''Games''' - [[Game|Same as Tech forum, but the arguments here are the consoles (360, PS3, Wii and handhelds). Regardless the post, everyone needs to really get laid.  Also, the Games forum is an RSS feed of kotaku & IGN courtesy of D'angelo and RB.]]

{{tinyquote|This forum is used for all the fanboys loves and hates on everything game related. People argue which game system was the biggest in gaming revolution. Atari or Ninentdo, Nintendo or Atari. It's usually kept in check by the biggest Nintendo fanboy of all time. He's the moderator known as RB/RecyclingBin. If Nintendo makes it he'll post it...even if it's been posted before. He's Nintendo's White Knight.|The general consensus of what the Games Forum is.}}

*'''[[Animal|Pets]]''' – Despite the fact that Stile founded his main webpage on [[Animal abuse|animal torture videos,]] he finds it necessary to make a pets sub forum.  In this forum you will find threads like “101 uses for peanut butter” and a bunch of faggots who like [[Cat|cats.]]

*'''Cars''' – this is a place for all the [[Pimp My Ride|motorheads]] of the Forum to unite and discuss their love of automobiles.  All four of them.

*'''Politics''' – troll of a troll of a troll of a troll of a troll of a troll of a…

*'''Writer’s Craft''' – if you cannot find enough [[Fanfiction|erotic fiction]] to satisfy your needs on the internet, come to this forum and be underwhelmed.  Also, you can find a shitton of [[Poetry|bad poetry]] written by [[Teenager|teens]] who aren’t gutsy enough to put it on their [[MySpace|myspace pages.]]

*'''[[Sport|Sports]]''' – Home of [[Winnar|Monday morning quarterbacks]] and people who love [[Soccer|soccer…]]  On top of that, you can discuss anything to do with betting and [[Native Americans|gambling.]]

*'''Art''' – This is getting monotonous…you guys know that there are such places like [[DevianTART|Deviantart]] and [[Image Hosting|flickr?]]

*'''Home Improvement''' – possible the [[Nothing|least visited webpage]] in the history of the internet.  Unless it deals with getting urine stains out of carpet or how to “pretty up the basement” you aren’t going to find anything of value here.

*'''Food''' – Stile featured a video of a cat being killed, gutted, cut up, and cooked in a open air wok on his front page.  [[Vegetarian|I am sure you can find all sorts of appetizing recipes in this forum.]]

*'''Exercise, Health, and Bodybuilding''' – Home of the [[Internet tough guy|internet tough guys.]]  In this forum you can discover a yoga trick that will allow you to [[Oral_sex#Autofellatio|suck your own dick.]]

*'''Whore Illuminati''' – OOOOOH a [[The Internet is serious business|secret forum!]]  This is nothing more than a watered down version of General Mayhem.  Less trolling and more [[Waaaambulance|bawwwing]] can be found here.  At one time, this forum held [[Drama War|porn/invasion/trolling]] dealings, but it's now used simply for crying about posters that cannot yet see the secret forum.

'''A Note on the Subforums'''

It is generally agreed upon by most of the Forum Members that at least eight of the sub-forums could disappear and nobody would be the wiser.  They were added by Stile in an attempt to appease a bunch of whiney faggots who barely use their newly granted sub-forums anyways.  What part about "General" Mayhem don't you understand?


== '''Moderators''' ==

[[Image:Ban.chart.2009.png|center|thumb|175px|Its like a vicious and wicked game to them.]]

{{squote|oh, don't expect me to ever talk about recent things on the forum, i stopped paying attention with the url changed|MrWee}}


There are seventeen active [[Moderator|moderators]] on the Forum.  For purposes of this section, “active” is defined as [[Ragequit|“having logged in at least once in the last eight years.”]]  While posts and interaction by the moderators is not normal, “the mods” (a term of endearment or butthurt depending on which side of the [[Banhammer|banstick]] you fall on) have been known to ban trolls, spammers, and great contributors simply for not licking their ass and bowing every time they posted.”  Current mods have gotten past mods demodded for "inactivity" when in reality it was for not being their lifelong friends and agreeing with everything they said.

Here they are with a brief description:

*'''Stile''' – Jew.  Becomes butthurt over silly things and [[Perma-ban|perma-bans]] anybody who gets in his way. 

*'''Kevin''' — the forum [[Nazi|administrator]] and ''the help'' when it comes to being stile’s [[Slavery|whipping boy.]]  He is a generally well-liked fellow who has to do what he does and sound like he does because he is getting a [[Internet money|paycheck.]]

*'''Insolite''' – Generally a [[Insane|stable]] and laid back moderator, he posts about three times per year.  When he does actually post, he uses the time to spam his crappy music.  There has been some speculation that Insolite is actually [[Death|dead]] and some other person is using his [[Hacker|hacked]] forum account. 
 
*'''Raven''' – Not a very active mod.  Raven generally works on his own group of sites and uses the Forum as a place to [[Spam|spam]] his pages.  He only posts in Porno Paradise.

*'''Poteen''' – This moderator posts about two times per year and they generally are two word replies.  Ten years ago, [[Old|Poteen]] was much more active.

*'''Boorak''' – nobody knows who this [[Assclown|assclown]] is.  He was formerly known as “Happynoiz” and was an assclown back then as well.

*'''Ditsy''' – [[Camwhore]] that married Kevin.  This is a win/win situation for the loving couple as Ditsy gets [[Rape dollars|forum power]] (L O L) and Kevin gets laid.

*'''DemonSeed''' – Was [[Rape|chased off]] the internet by a troll named Microwoman.

*'''VenoM''' – Probably the most [[Oneoneone|personable]] and well liked of the moderators.  He is known to be able to take a joke or a troll and will (for the most part) let things slide.  

*'''Fire''' – Takes delight in being known as the Forum’s resident [[Nazi]].  If you have ever been banned on the forum, chances are fire was the faggot behind it.  despite all this, fire is a very active and energetic moderator who posts on a regular basis.  Fire is also a vocal [[Animal Liberation Front|petafag.]]

*'''RecyclingBin''' – An internet [[Internet stalking|creep who stalks]] any woman who dares to enter the [[Video games|Games]] sub-forum.  He also stalks camwhores and people who happen to have the name dmonix.  He is well known for the “Great Watermark Banning” incident.

*'''[[Old|Argent]]''' –  Is simply put, a moderator to keep people from bugging camwhores (who don’t post anymore anyway).  

*'''MrWee''' – if VenoM is the most liked and most personable of the moderators, MrWee is a close second.  He doesn’t go to the Forum anymore due to a crippling addiction to [[World of Warcraft|WoW]]. Insanely defensive of his significant other, who was a total whore in her previous life.

*'''Kohi''' – Kohi earned his modship on the Forum by [[Alcoholic|out-drinking]] everybody else on the Forum.

*'''Hughnon''' – [[England|OMG HE’S BRITISH.]]  Was an uphill gardener on the forum, regarded for his wit and insight.  Then he became a moderator and those great posts became “I’ll ban you” overnight.  Insufferably smug.

*'''Shen''' – If Fire didn't ban you, Shen is probably the guy who did it.  Shen is a very tech-savvy individual who will pork you for talking about rep.  He is also known to like to watch grown men oil up and [[Professional Wrestling|wrestle each other.]]

*'''Milamber''' - Recently promoted to mod because these other tards pretend to have lives outside teh interweb. May be drilling Teknobunny, The Forum's resident tranny dwarf.

[[Image:Mem10.jpg|thumb|175px|loldongs]]
[[Image:Spfcollage.jpg|thumb|175|the whole gang]]

The Forum has been around in several incarnations for about ten years.  Over that time there have been plenty of played out dramas upon its internet stage.  Here are some of the most notable ones:

*'''The Strange Case of Miss Malevolent/Doc_Weasel Stalking Incident'''

{{quote|Shut up, you tubby bitch.|doc weasel}}

What started out as [[Internet drama|innocent play]] on the Forum got out of control quickly and escalated into a full on [[IRL|real life battle.]]  There was stalking and there were phone calls to people’s bosses.  This ended in both Miss Malevolent and Doc Weasel being permabanned from all of Stile’s websites.  Currently Doc Weasel hosts his own [[Crap|shitty forum]] that is pretty much the same as the stile Forum.

*'''Rob Shoves a 2-foot Dildo Up his Ass'''

Rob, always confrontational, told the forum that he could shove a 2-foot dildo up his ass.  Nobody believed him, so he showed the world just how wrong they were.  Also, in the folder, there is an extra video of Rob sucking his own cock.

See [http://illogic.net/ed/pb/ Here] for the videos.

*'''Rob Posts [[CP]]'''

Rob, or Lemme, or GODHATESUSALL, or ROBHATESUSALL, a teen with a small amount of internet fame and a [[Bonertron|huge amount of cock]] is permabanned from all of Stile’s websites for dccing child pornography ([[Stile_Project#Death_of_the_Irc_Server|through dying IRC]])  indiscriminately to anybody who had him on their dcc-allow list.  He has several times tried to come back to the Forum, but is subsequently banned for these efforts and has never really regained his [[Internet celebrity|old internet fame.]]  Recently, Rob has openly stated that any of the sex videos he has given to Stile over the years are in fact child pornography due to he being only 17 (and his girlfriend being 16) at the time he filmed and sent them to Stile to be posted.


*'''[[Asperger's syndrome|The Great Watermark Ban Incident]]'''

At one point, Stile became worried that some of the images he was hosting might infringe upon copyright claims owned by others.  He asked his forum members to edit out watermarks and any other identifying information that might link the images back to their owners.  At first, most forum members would do as he asked and either use mspaint or Photoshop to simply cover up a website’s watermark.  Other posters just didn’t give a fuck and posted the images un-edited.  This would usually be dealt with by the mods giving the poster a stern warning.  This went on for some time until people realized that it was stupid and watermarks were all but forgotten.  
Forgotten by everybody but one person…[[Retard|RecyclingBin.]]  RecyclingBin, or RB as he is known, was made a mod and retroactively banned people for posting images that contained watermarks.  It has been estimated that the total number of people banned by RB during this fiasco was around “a fucking shit ton” of posters.  Nothing could be done, the damage was terrible.  Groups of posters found themselves without an account and either signed up new accounts or left the site forever.  Many lulz were had.

'''TL;DR''' RB bans everybody for no reason.


*'''Gone Away and Larss'''

[[Pussy-whipped|Gone Away, an old mod of the forum]] decided to allow his slob of a [[Girlfriend|girlfriend]] to use his account to ninja-ban many unsuspecting Forum members.  They were busted and subsequently shown the door.


*'''Manxk'''

Another mod who was shown the door after it was discovered that his mod account was [[Hacker|compromised]] and that several of his [[Friends|housemates were using it.]]


*'''Lestat the Gold'''

[[HA! HA! Guy|Forum member who was given mod status.  At that point he began to ban every user on the forum in alphabetical order.]]


*'''[[Fat|Faceplant]]'''

[[Please unban|Unban]] Faceplant.


*'''The Camwhores Forum'''

The [[Camwhore|Camwhores]] forum was originally attached to The Forum, but was moved due to the fact that the camwhores could not take the [[DO NOT WANT|abuse that normal forum members were giving them.]]  In a moment of pure genius, stile moved the forum to a  new and secret location, thus alienating the two forums forever...unless you are an internet stalker like pyromaniac_guy.


*'''Death of the Irc Server'''

[[Image:Cap2.jpg|thumb|right|175px|OH NOS]]

A small amount of drama was generated in the early days of 2009 concerning the end of stile's IRC server.  He has opted to use a browser based chat system that truly is the chat vehicle of the millenium.  For a better understanding of this incident, a section has been added to the Stile Project page and is located [[Stile_Project#Death_of_the_Irc_Server|here.]]


*'''Masamune Might Get [[Secks|Laid]]'''

<pre>
 12:43:07           cancerrr : hi masamune
 12:43:12           cancerrr : i've decided i want to fuck u
 12:43:23           Masamune : you're goddamn right you do!
</pre>

== '''Other Areas of The Forum''' ==

'''The Gallery'''

Users of the forum are granted space where they can upload pictures to stile’s server.  [[Sick fuck|Nobody]] uses this feature, however the small number of users who do, generally post porn.

'''Blogs'''

Yet another unused portion of The Forum.  This is generally where people put [[Blog|journal-like posts]] that [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody ever reads.]]

'''Control Panel'''

This is where you see the comments that are [[Cancerr#Negative_Reputation|tied to your rep.]]  this section of The Forum is always full of lulz and the comments are generally priceless.

'''Profile'''

Here you can make a little [[Failbook|web page all your own.]]  About one half of one percent of The Forum users actually know this part of their account exists.  This part of The Forum account will show you the [[Internet stalking|latest visitors to your profile page]] and their comments if they choose to make any.  You can also view your online [[Newbie|“friends”]] list from this page.

*Jew
*People talking about [[Attention|reputation points.]]  Shhhh! Don't speak of rep anywhere on the forums...if you do, it will garner you an insta-ban that will last at least a week.  It is a general conclusion that rep has helped kill the forum.  Users are too worried about their rep to actually [[Liar|speak their mind and say what they really mean.]]

[[Image:Spf - taint.JPG|thumb|Sircle, a regular user, posts his taint.]]

For a forum that prides itself as being one of the toughest, most [[GTFO|racy forums on the internet,]] The Forum has a shockingly low amount of [[Tits|tits posted]] to its pages.  About the only time stile ever comes to his own message board is when he is either demanding tits or demanding money.  This is a collection of tits and ass (lol) that stile demanded.  It must be noted that most of these pictures are at least five years old and the [[Slut|girls that are pictured]] herein are [[Old|OLD]] and have [[Baby|BABIES]] now.

=='''The Batch of Retards'''==

===Vested Retards and Retards Emeritus===

Below you will find a list of some of the more historical users of TheForum and a brief description of their general demeanor.  This list is sorted by the number of posts a Forum user has and is a direct reflection of their quality of life.  The higher the post count, the higher the probability the Forum user is a total loser living in a world of baked monkey shit.  Some of the users with the highest post counts are mods.  See their entries above.


*'''1337 Gamer''' - There is nothing sadder than a retarded 8 year old.  I wish I had a link for you so that you could donate money to some charity, but they haven't invented a name for 1337's brand of retard yet.

*'''Aaron5000''' - Hippy wannabe, runs a lame-ass IRC server in an attempt to keep an antiquated protocol alive for faggots who don't care.

*'''agent_provocateur''' - Dingbat AZN lady-boi who does porn.

*'''animephreak''' - A short, fat Frankenstein monster, this gem of a poster no longer frequents TheForum. His creep factor is legendary.

*'''Aphrodite''' - Acidic whore who should be in the kitchen rather than wasting precious time on TheForum.

*'''beb0p''' - Guido from New Jersey who doesn't post anymore.  Consumed too many Jager-bombs and got his fingers crushed in a tomato soup machine.

*'''BioHazard''' - He says it himself:  "I have no life, and I live in NYC."  How long have you lived in the morgue?

*'''blacklotus''' - His forum profile says "Portuguese yumminess." So yeah, not only is he a douchebag, he's smug about it.

*'''Brewu''' - Drunk from Georgia (is there any other kind of Georgian?) who is preoccupied with "As Seen On TV" products.

*'''coke baby''' - If possible, more retarded than anybody on this list.  He generally posts the letter ''g'' as his reply.

*'''Crunchy Hamster''' - Forum poster who, at the age of 30, asks for advice on black magic.  Emo... shits bats... etc.  Posts nice pics though.

*'''cucka''' - Cute dipshit, at least his priest thought so in 2nd grade.

*'''deezer4u''' - Likes to post pictures of his penis on a forum full of men.

*'''Dizzy_''' - Californian, i.e. douche.

*'''DrZoidberg''' - Swedish jerk-off champion of 2006, 2007, 2008.  Practices bondage with his whore wife, whom he forced to get breast implants.

*'''evil.me''' - A huge, gigantic deutchebag.

*'''Finch''' - Another loser who used to post a lot, but doesn't anymore because TheForum sucks.

*'''fornicon''' - Humble and honest, Shoeshine Boy of TheForum. Beloved by his mother.

*'''Grizzly Dick''' - Trolling gadfly who succeeded in getting perma-banned by Stile himself, no mean feat.

*'''heerohammer''' - Has over 6000 posts at TheForum... not so hard to accomplish if you post "I didn't watch Fringe tonight" in a thread about Fringe.

*'''H-K''' - From Croatia.  All people from Croatia are perverts.  And they are hairy.  Like H-K.

*'''Ishitinatuba''' - Sorely missed, this Australian douche found something else better to do.

*'''Kirtan''' - Australian who will never be a mod on TheForum no matter how much he suckles on stile's penor.

*'''Legion''' - Porn/tech nerd who pretty much only posts in the Porn or Tech forums.  Oh yeah, and the porn is shitty.

*'''Lsdizm''' - Left no stain when he was finished.

===Current Bullshit===

While this list includes the top posters, the following are some of the more active posters recently.  Just because a person posts now does not mean they are any smarter than those posters listed above.  In fact, it points out that they are bigger losers due to the fact that they didn't learn any lessons from guys who came before them.


*'''Adam Weishaupt''' - "awesome", if "awesome" means "faggot".

*'''aesium''' - Likes to repost shit that was reposted six months ago.  Also, he likes to repost shit that was posted six months ago.

No secrets though, he's an equal opportunity perv, gulping teh cock and porking the beav. Enjoys taking self-portraits at gaming conventions to prove he's in with the cool kids.  Recently posted pics of his tranny "girlfriend".
