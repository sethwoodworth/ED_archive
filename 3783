'''"How are you feeling today /b/?"''' was a question posed by one daring [[btard|/b/tard]] to his fellow [[4chan]] comrades. The [[OP]] was kind enough to present his fellow /b/tards with a means of expressing the day they'd just endured... a [[photoshop]] / [[MSPaint]] ready XY plot graph, typos and all.
<br>
<br>
/b/tards worldwide [[Emo|opened their hearts]] one-by-one and expressed the trials and tribulations of their day (in XY plot graph format, of course). [[Basement Dweller|Participants]] were asked to plot the highs and lows of their <s>happiness</s> <b><i>happieness</i></b> levels throughout the day from 0 to 100, beginning from the moment they awoke (<b><i>woke up</i></b>) and ending at the time that they were filling out their personal happiness chart (<b><i>rite now</i></b>).
<br>
<br>
One rather surprising revelation from the results is the vast number of /b/tards who seem to have [[girlfriend]]s <nowiki>*</nowiki>[[bullshit|cough cough]]<nowiki>*</nowiki>. Unsurprising is the number of /b/tards whose daily ritual includes [[fap]]ping, [[World of Warcraft|WoW]] or a combination of both.
