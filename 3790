''Not to be confused with [[XBox|Huegbox]].''

The hugbox is a [[BDSM]] device mainly used by [[Autism|retards]] who are too [[gay|faggy]] to admit they are kinky bastards. As a meme it was initially coined by [[sdf]], "[[gb2|Go back to]] your hugbox" is a frequently-flung insult to those who have been trolled by [[Bantown]]. A [[Wikipedia:hug machine|hugbox]] is a purported remedy for [[Asperger's Syndrome]] and other forms of [[autism]]. It is a machine wherein an aspie crawls inside, and is squashed by two giant [[Vagina|labial folds]], thus producing the feeling of being loved, because a machine that looks like a torture instrument did it with an industrial paper printer is perfect at simulating real love, [[amirite|amirite?]]. It is also a very profound metaphor for [[LiveJournal]] and many other online forums.

The hugbox insult is also a great way to troll autism-themed communities. It's guaranteed to earn you countless replies from angry fucktards telling you that you are a [[win|horrible human being]]. Just remind them how glad they can be not to be [[nerd]]s any more, now that they've [[Digimon|digivolved]] into some new kind of [[tard]].

==Proper Usage==
[[Image:Hugbox IRL.jpg|thumb|A hugbox IRL.  You think we make this shit up?]]
Used primarily in insult form in response to complaints/improper requests, or as a valediction.	

<blockquote>
  <shipley> WTF TAKE MY BBQ DOWN YOU ASSHOLES<br>	
  <[[sdf]]> Go back to your hugbox, aspie.<br>
  -!- [[Brattie]] was kicked from #bantown by [[sdf]] [Go back to your hugbox.]	
</blockquote>
