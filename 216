Typically used only by jackasses, ad hominem is a [[Latin]] term for [[shit talking]]. Detailed studies reveal that it occupies 87% of all forum traffic.

== History ==
Ad hominems were invented by the Romans in 700 [[BCE]].

In their time ad hominem translated as "to the man" and was generally used as a euphemism for gifts to one's [[homosexual]] lover.  These gifts primarily took the form of an early candy made from beech twigs and honey, to which the term was synonymous.

As society evolved they realised how disgusting ad hominems were in comparison to things like tripe, sauerkraut, and haggis.  Ad hominems consequently began to fall out of favour and in short time they came to be what we know them as today - a personal insult. By as early as the twelfth century it was degrading to receive an ad hominem in place of contemporary gifts such as new leggings, or an Iranian incense burner.

Unfortunately the internet's architecture does not currently allow people to send their [[gay]] lovers gifts of honey and twigs, so they simulate the practice through the use of derogatory language.

==Usage Notes==
Before making an ad hominem attack, it is a good idea to keep the following things in mind:
* In [[Debate]], any person disagreeing with the [[OP]] is using ad hominem.
* If you are [[Salt the Earth|salting the earth]], implementation of ad hominem attacks is imperative.
* It is impossible to make an ad hominem attack against a [[furry]].
* If you want to  call someone else out on using ad hominem, please remember to italicize the phrase, like so: ''ad hominem''. This shows that you are intelligent and recognize that it's a Latin phrase. Smarter people might point out that italicizing such a common phrase that is in all the English dictionaries is [[retard]]ed. If someone brings this up, accuse them of ad hominem as well.
