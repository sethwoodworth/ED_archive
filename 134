ABC is...

#A shitty [[television]] network set specifically for [[women]] and [[fags]] with too many commercials, unless you are in [[Redneck Wonderland]] where ABC has no commercials and only educational programs. Also, as of [[2006]], it has canceled any Game Show that has managed to get on the air after less than 10 episodes. ABC.com uses the worst video player known to man. Full of commercials and the slowest loading video evar.
#A song by the [[Michael Jackson|Jackson Five]].
#Always Believe [[Christ]]
#Always Be Closing: "A-B-C. A-Always, B-Be, C-Closing. Always be closing, always be closing." A memorable quote from the [[boring|unmemorable]] motion picture "Glengarry Glen Ross".
#The first three letters of the alphabet.
#A pointless article.
