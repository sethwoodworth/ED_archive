Matt "Dirty" Sanchez is a [[conservative|rightard]] [[blogosphere|blawgger]], commentator, independant journalist, and [[military|Marine]] reservist. He is also a [[faggot]] ex-man[[whore]] and gay porn star. [[Liberals]] laugh at him and his flaming American [[penis]]. He is also one ugly motherfucker.

== Early Life ==
[[Image:Sanchez_buttsecks.jpg|thumb|Sanchez explains to a colleague the reasons why pulling out of Iraq too early would be a big mistake.]]
Matt Sanchez, aka Rod Majors, aka Pierre LaBranche was born in 1970. As a young man he appeared in such fine films as Montreal Men, Jawbreaker, Touched by an Anal, and many others. [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0538273/] He also worked as a [[whore|"masseuse"]], where he provided "excellent top" quality [[buttsecks|rubdowns]] for a mere $200, $250 outcall. [http://cplsanchez.kimtragedy.info/]

Sanchez eventually became disillusioned with the world of [[faggotry]] and the spreading of [[AIDS]]. He joined the [[military|Marines]] and converted to a [[fundamentalist|born again]] [[Republican]] [[conservative|rightard]]. After he was [[ejaculate|discharged]] from the Marines for having too much [[AIDS]] he decided to go to college.

== Political Activism and National Recognition ==

One day while he attended classes at Columbia, Sanchez was accosted by by a herd of [[hippy]] [[leftards]]. They called him [[stupid]] and "[[dead babies|baby-killer]]," and made fun of him for being a Mexican (proving indeed that liberals are racist hypocrites). Instead of being a man about it, by [[rape|raeping]] their throats until he crushed their larynxes with his massive [[cock|schlong]], he had to be a big gaywad and go file a [[butthurt|formal complaint]] with the University. When he was ignored by the school, he took his complaint to [[Fox News]].

Sanchez' [[hissy fit|impassioned pleas]] for tolerance eventually gained him national recognition from such rightard [[retards|luminaries]] as [[Ann Coulter]], [[Bill O'Reilly]] , [[Sean Hannity]], [[Michelle Malkin]], and [[Newt Gingrich]]. He was awarded the first ever [[bullshit|America, Fuck Yeah, Super-Patriot!!!! Award]].

Then the details of his [[gay|sordid]] past became public. [[Lulz]] ensued.

== Sanchez and Wikipedia ==
[[Image:Rodmajorsakamattsanchez.jpg|thumb|It's only fictional!!!]]
Matt Sanchez is [[butthurt]], because he can't control what goes into his own [[Wikipedia]] page. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Matt_Sanchez]

== Sanchez in Iraq ==

Sanchez is currently working as an embedded journalist in [[Iraq]]. He was one of the first people to expose on his [[blog|blawg]] that Pvt [[Scott Thomas Beauchamp]] was full of [[shit]]. [[Some argue]] that he may have also [[rape|raeped]] Pvt Beauchamp, though that has yet to be corroborated.
