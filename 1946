'''DALnet''' was an [[IRC]] network started by homos that couldn't cut it on [[EFnet]]. It's named after its founder who is in turn named after a [[FYIAD|fantasy dragon]]. This should have given the network instant cred amongst the [[furry]] community. Instead it became wildly popular with pedophiles, Christians, [[16 year old girl|16 year old cutter girls]], their stalkers, and the profession of invasive [[beastiality|animal husbandry]]; not a far cry, really.  

It owed a large part of its appeal to its implementation of [[moonspeak|Spanish]], without which channel takeovers and nick thefts would have been impossible. It also made it far more easier for fat people to get [[India|slurpees]].

DALnet was the largest of all IRC networks until the year after [[JEWS DID WTC|9/11]], when it made the mistake of [[K-line|G-lining]] Mexico. DALnet was then treated to a hot helping of beaner surprise when all [[at least 100|365,001,024]] [[AOL]] [[fucktards|chatterz]] rose up with their infected clients and /kicked DAL from #internet. Untold numbers of [[troll]]s were forced from their basements and into the light of day, where the merciless rays of the sun transformed them into Utah goths.

DAL has [[divide by zero|collapsed in on itself]].  It now shares the fate of black holes, neutron stars, and Usenet: [[shit nobody cares about|utterly fucking useless]].
