Songfic
{{crap}}

The bastard child of a [[fanfiction|fanfic]], and an [[AMV]], a songfic is a fic "set to music." They are usually written by crazed [[fangirl]]s in order to show both the superiority of [[Linkin Park]] and their chosen [[OTP]], whatever that may be. 

They usually take the following form:

~*~*~*~*~*~*~

<i>It starts with one thing<br>
I don't know why<br>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
Keep that in mind<br>
I designed this rhyme<br>
To explain in due time<br>
All I know <br></i>

~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Luffy stared sorrowfully at the ground. They had been travelling together all this time, and yet Zolo still seemed completely oblivious to his advances.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~

<i>Time is a valuable thing<br>
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings<br>
Watch it count down to the end of the day<br>
The clock ticks life away<br>
It's so unreal <br></i>

~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Et cetera, et cetera.

[[Joss Whedon]] (yes, he incorporates all aspects of fandom) popularized songifcs by writing one of his own in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'s sixth season. Entitled "Once More With Feeling", the plot involves... oh hell, you've either seen it or you're going to.
