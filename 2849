Family Guy
[[Image:Familyguyreaction.jpg|thumb|[[DO NOT WANT|Typical reaction]] to watching ''Family Guy''.]]

Remember that old TV sitcom ''[[Incest|All In The Family]]''? Now imagine [[nostalgia|that show]] [[Simpsons|animated]] and stripped of it's pride, lulz, and intelligence. Now imagine a whole BRAND NEW KOOKY SHOW with a retarded, gluttonous, yet lovable father, a long-suffering, yet Jew with an annoying voice, a smart daughter that everyone hates, a stupid son that is just a younger version of his dad, and a smart baby. [[Simpsons|Sound familiar?]]

''Family Guy'' is the worst and most overrated show in existence. The entire series depends on the flashbacks of characters [[fail|to exhibit humor]] upon the plot of an average family's life in Quahog, Rhode Island. The show is popular amongst [[you|developmentally disabled bottom feeders]] who repeat the lame one-liners in very obnoxious "[[unfunny|funny]]" voices. 

Being a midget and a liberal douche, [[Seth MacFarlane]] sought to get back at every person taller and more successful than him. The entire show is basically him preaching his dumb liberal rhetoric through Brian, while making sure Brian gets more bitches in each episode than Quagmire. Compensating for something Seth?

==Characters==
[[Image:Family_guy_bingo.jpg|thumb|right|''Family Guy'' bingo, where everyone's a winner!]]
A "Character" [[Some Argue|is defined by]] being progressive to the plot, or whatever is left of it. There are countless throwaway characters in Family Guy's craptastic manatee jokes that can be automatically discounted, and anyone who lists the vaudeville cunts under this section will be [[raped]]. 

This section only looks at the characters of the show and how they have changed over time. 

=== The Griffins ===
[[Image:Familyguy9.gif|600px|center]]

=== Secondary characters ===
*'''Glen Quagmire'''
**Originally: 'hilarious' pervert who gets boring quickly
**Now: Unfunny rapist

*'''Cleveland Brown'''
**Originally: Token black character, the most [[boring]] of Peter's clique
**Now: Somehow managed to escape the show to star in [[Fail|his own spin-off]]

*'''Joe Swanson'''
**Originally: Self-sufficient, crippled cop who and a total [[Buttsex|hard ass]] 
**Now: Helpless cripple and the butt of all jokes not directed at Meg. Also has uncontrollable fits of rage. Which are still unfunny.

*'''Herbert'''
**Originally: A one-episode character of no importance
**Now: Easy go-to when a writer wants to pad out the episode with cheap pedophile jokes.
 
*'''Bruce'''
**Originally: Some random guy with a mustache and that calm voice.
**Now: Gay faggot with that [[unfunny]] catchphrase "Oh no!" that is used by [[13-year-old boy|13 year old fanboys]] of the show over and over again in a desperate attempt to be [[no|funny]].

===Criticisms===
[[Image:Brianlois.jpg|thumb|"...like that time we made a [[Rule 34|34]]."]]

It should be noted that, while ''Simpsons'' fans accuse ''Family Guy'' of unoriginality (in which they are absolutely right), ''The Simpsons'' itself has merely employed the same formulaic cartoon-like jokes as shown in hundreds of animated series, but with utter disregard for any facet of popular or modern culture (which is why ''The Simpsons'' remains popular with [[nerd]]s and virgin [[Slashdot]] fanboys who have no relation with the outside world, although it can't touch ''Family Guy'' in that regard). 

This awful show has no continuity at all. In an episode of ''[[South Park]]'' Matt Stone and Trey Parker attempt to "reveal"  how exactly all the retarded, unfunny flashbacks were created: [[Fat|manatees]] and [[balls]]. Of course this was already apparent to anyone with an IQ over 85 but it took ''South Park'' to point this out to ''South Park'' fans and this was accepted as gospel.

''Family Guy'' fans, of course, were filled with disbelief. This led to them being silent for an entire minute as they digested this fact, in what has come to be known as, "the greatest minute ever spent with Family Guy fans, ever".

Openly [[pedophile|pedophiliac]] creator [[Faggot|Seth MacFarlane]] has also come under criticism for [[South Park|pushing his politics on the show]] and other faggotry like his love of adding [[Shit nobody cares about|pointless musical numbers]] to inflict his 'singing', [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|which only he considers special]]. Like the dog on the show, Seth MacFarlane is a liberal with a gay cousin. The dog went from an unfunny background character to having entire episodes built around him being a pretentious asshole and [[bestiality|banging hot chicks]]. Which means MacFarlane is [[furry|living out his fantasies through a fucking animal and is goddamn furry queer]].

''Family Guy'' may as well be created by [[Eric Bauman]] by padding all of its new content with [[Unwarranted self-importance|stolen]] [[memes]] from the [[Internet|Internets]] so [[newfags]] can giggle and ask their [[13_year_old_boy|middle school friends]] if they saw that episode over [[AIM]].

==Writing==
 
The secret to writing a good Family Guy episode is this simple formula.

*'''Step 1''': Start every joke with "You think THAT'S bad, remember the time I..."
*'''Step 2''': Mix two pop culture references that were popular before [[1980s|1990]] "...hung out with Michael J. Fox in the Mushroom Kingdom?"
*'''Step 3''': Your punchline should involve a sex joke or an attack on Bush that was rejected from [[leftard|The Daily Show]].
**Michael J. Fox: Oh, hi Peter! Is it just me or are these shrooms making you shake?
**Peter Griffin: I think you have Parkinsons.
**Michael J. Fox: Phew, I thought we contracted AIDS.
**Peter Griffin (Grabs Fox): NO ONE MUST EVER KNOW!!!
*'''Step 4''': ???
*'''Step 5''': [http://www.paywizard.org/main/VIPPaycheck/VIPpaycheckauthors 25 MILLION MOTHERFUCKING DOLLARS A YEAR!]

==The Fucking Chicken==
In the show's great tradition of jokes that go for way, way, way too long, in an early episode there was a several-minute-long extremely unfunny scene where Peter fought a man in a chicken suit. For some reason Seth thought people liked this "joke" and so he bought it back several times and it is now about 40% of the show's content.

==Fandom==
The fandom consists of [[autism|autistic]] [[13 year old boy]]s, [[Chris-chan]], and [[stoner|stoned]] college kids who chant quotes from the show like mantras. Some of them will excuse the fact that the show is 80 percent fart jokes by prattling on about post-modernism. It was once thought that any fan of ''Family Guy'' was probably also a [[fantard]] of [[Dane Cook]], another unfunny retard. Like [[Cock|Cook]] [[Fag|fans]], ''Family Guy'' fans tend to be loud, obnoxious, and pretentious due to them emulating the material. This myth was busted in a recent episode, where it [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMpsYnHl1nQ makes fun of Dane Cook and his followers.]

Ironically, you are guaranteed to get laid by fat chicks who never get laid, if you act like you're a ''Family Guy'' fan on any college campus. Being (or even pretending to be) a fan will negate any [[antisocial]] traits you may exhibit from being an [[anime]] fan.

If one were to insult ''Family Guy'' to a fan, said fan would likely rant on how much you [[Irony|"have no sense of humor"]] and will continue on for hours about how much [[Blowjob|"you suck"]], while telling you that [[DO NOT WANT|"you should like ''Family Guy'' because it is your type of humor."]] However, anyone that actually ''has'' a sense of humor doesn't find anything funny in such utter [[faggotry]]. People who like Family Guy should do the world a favor and become [[an hero]].

===Alternate Universe===
When ''Family Guy'' was canceled for [[Over 9000|the 9,0001]]st time, creator [[Libtard|Seth MacFarlane]] decided to recast the show and call it ''[[American Dad]]''. The reincarnation is exactly the same show, only instead of an evil baby and a talking dog there's an [[German|evil]] talking fish and a [[faggot]] alien. The Faggot alien and both Family Guy and American Dad are an expression of [[faggot|Seth MacFarlane]] penchant for weird gender bending [[fetishes]]. The alien's obsession for wigs and make-up are an expression of Seth's [[ghey]] hair and make-up fetishes.

''American Dad'' is one tiny iota [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|better]] than ''Family Guy'' because it lacks [[WHEN_I_WAS|remember when...]] flashback jokes. 

But wait, there's [[moar|MORE]]! Soon to replace ''King of the Hill'' is another Family Guy [[shit|spinoff]] starring the show's token nigra character, Cleveland!

Just who is MacFarlane blowing to keep getting these shows greenlighted?

===Family Guy: The Game===
The Family Guy fanbase cried, whined and went into their hugboxes until their demands of a Family Guy video game were met. Suddenly, one day.. It came to life. Featuring [[Old meme|lame one liners from old episodes you've seen a million times]], [[Metal Gear Solid|broken stealth missions]], [[Super Smash Bros.|nonsensical brawling]] stages, and [[Sonic|platform levels with shitty cameras]].  Let's not forget all your [[fags|favorite characters]]!


Deemed unworthy of even a landfill.

===Jewtube===
[[Sell Out|Seth Macfarlane]] was [[cock block|infuriated]] when he realized that most of Family Guy's [[retards|fan base]] was just watching all of his shows on Youtube and decided to call [[bullshit]] and posted all of his videos on [[hell|Hulu.com]] [[hilarious|which will not allow anybody who isn't an American to watch any of their videos]]

Very few videos remain on Youtube except [[shit no one cares about| ones supporting Hulu.com showing clips of the baby acting like a twelve year old Pete Burns]]. Of the few remaining videos these [[awesome|fake]] videos remain. Some claim that they are actually better than Seth Macfarlane's product, and others claim that this was all some gay creation by a [[13-year-old boy]] (coincidence?).

Upon realizing the potential of this "youtube". Seth's Jew kicked in, as he decided to bring his fail to youtube under the name "Sethcomedy", in an attempt to bring in even more money to himself with his so called [[not funny|"sense of humor"]]. On this channel, he makes comedy skits, in which [[Chris Chan|some argue]] are hilarious. Of course, anyone with a fucking brain knows that these comedy skits are as [[unfunny]] as Family Guy and American Dad combined. Don't believe anything could fail that much? Watch for yourself.
