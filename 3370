'''Goatse Security''' is an [[internet]] and [[computer]] security watchgroup promoting and encouraging the [[GNAA|homosexual African American agenda]]. Founder [[Kirk Johnson]] hired security consultant [[Weev]] to be its general manager. Goatse Security or "Goatsec" has most recently focused its attention exposing security vulnerabilities for the benefit of the public at large. In early 2010, a cross-protocol scripting [[Firefox Exploit|vulnerability]] was discovered in the [[Firefox]] web browser, anally [[fisting]] a certain [[Freenode|IRC network]] associated with a shadowy [[Lilo|confidence swindler]] living in Europe after faking his death in a Texas cycling accident.  Shortly thereafter, the [[Safari XPS Attack]] was publicized. Security experts familiar with terms such as "integer overflow port blocking" and the emergent "XHR vectored mail-merging / wordlist attack" aka VOLTRON, shuddered in fear. The vast majority of humanity, unaware of such horrors, or even the existence of an Apple browser, shrugged.

==AT&T iPad ICC ID email address harvest==

[[Image:Goatsemac.jpg|center|450px]]

That all changed [[Last Thursday]]. Goatse [[hacker|analysts]] successfully penetrated the [[Lie|steel fortress defenses]] of [[AT&T]]'s website, gaining access to email addresses of the elect 144000 beautiful [[iPad]] subscribers. Those [[stupid|wise]] enough to purchase a phone (which can't make calls) sporting a fragile, unprotected, 10 inch glass display, would never click a link in an unsolicited email, so really it wasn't much of a threat, amirite? Nonetheless, the blogosphere went positively Bill O'Reilly [[batshit]], calling for the head of Goatse's [[weev|spokesman]] despite the facts he didn't actually participate in the exploit, AT&T was made aware of the breach via a 3rd party, and that AT&T had successfully patched said gaping hole prior to the release of list to Gawker. [http://security.goatse.fr/on-disclosure-ethics  On Disclosure]

No Biggie, all any potential Russian or Chinese cyber-warrior could have put together was the name and ICC ID, right? Wellll, actually the ICC ID's weren't randomly paired to the IMSI. And just what does that mean? It means a competent hacker with the information leaking from AT&T's sieve-like website could know the real time location of Rahm Emmanuel's shiny electronic toy. [[HACKERS ON STEROIDS|Those injecting testosterone]] could intercept all data coming to and from this marvel of the ages. But AT&T informed all of their subscribers about this potential threat prior to Goatse's disclosure via Gawker, right? Nope. Motherfuckers weren't going to say shit. Luckily there are still a few Americans who care. Patriots. Heroes. Goatse.

Many pundits were quick to point out that as Cupertino products become more and more ubiquitous, the more likely they will be buttfucked by those lacking Goatse's benevolent White Hat ethos. Apple stock was up 4 bucks a share by the end of the week, leaving little room to argue [[Steve Jobs]] is not, in fact, Satan.  

Oh yeah, and that [[Safari XPS Attack|Safari vulnerability]]? They fixed it. Except on the iPad. Oops.
