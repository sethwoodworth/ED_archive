Mujahideen Video

'''Mujahideen''' is the plural of Mujahid, the [[Arab]]ic word for "one who does Jihad." '''Jihad''', of course, is the Arabic word for "[[Rape|struggle]]," especially a <s>spiritual</s> terrorist struggle, but is often used pejoratively: in combination with memes such as "[[torture|the War on Terror]]," [[9/11]], "Islamo-Fascism," as well as the (common) names of anyone doing anything that [[Israel]] and the [[The Jewnited States of Americunts]] don't like. 

Among [[Islam|Muslim]] <strike>'''freedom fighters'''</strike> [[faggots]], however, it is a favourable and beautiful concept akin to the [[4th of July|'''American Revolutionary War''']] of 1776 when the upstart [[Americunt]] colonials rose up against the brutality of [[United Kingdom|paying taxes]], and - in cahoots with the [[French]] - waged a guerilla campaign to rid the country of oppression. The most well known tactics include hiding behind babies and blowing themselves up.

==Background==
Since [[jews_did_wtc|Israel]] ordered the JewSA to exterminate [[Islam]], the resistance fighters of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]], not to mention Algeria, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Chechnya, [[Palestine]] and other places, have created a large number of inspirational videos designed to make jihadis [[Lolwut|feel strong and like they are on the right track]]. The videos usually show [[twink|young Arab guys]] or [[Virgin|grizzled old]] Taliban veterans scurrying around in some bushes, firing cannon at a military base, shooting down a helicopter, waiting for a tank to run over a huge [[bomb]]. For Americans and others who only get to see the "[[Republican|Coalition's]]" side of the fighting, with all the sappy drama about "The Troops," and the [[Liberal media|propaganda nonsense]] of how they are "fighting them there so we don't have to fight them here," it is actually pretty [[boring|interesting]] to see things from the [[shit nobody cares about|perspective of the <strike> freedom fighters</strike>]] [[Furfags| furfags]] (why else would someone camp in the mountains/desert with a bunch of bearded men?) , even if you don't agree with them 100%, or think both sides are [[retard|retarded]].

==Score==
Most of these videos are accompanied by semi-hypnotic Islamic songs called "nasheed," which have inspiring lyrics about the promises of [[an hero|martyrdom]]. You can imagine these dudes strapping on a suicide vest full of bombs, cranking up a great nasheed on the [[IPod]] and walking into police headquarters.

==Cinematography==
As the camera pans the scenes of carnage, you can usually hear a crescendo of revolutionary quotes, such as "[[Allahu Akbar]]!" ("God is the most great!") or "Bism'illah ir'Rahman ir'Rahim" ("In the name of Allah, most compassionate, most merciful"). The irony of the latter phrase is lost on them.

O Allah I am praying for martyrdom, 
so with your grace Allah let it be!<br>
