Filter
{{pixpls}}

'''Filters''' are a way for people with [[webcam]]s to distract the world from the reason they bought said webcam- so they would never have to actually let anyone see them. The most common filters [[KKK|take out all color]] and add blue to the white spots. This makes you look [[scene|hella fucking trendy]] and removes your big ears, zits and third nostril. It is widely used by emos to make them look [[Black people|dark and sinister]]. 

===How to use Filters===
#Turn on your webcam. Since it's on top of your computer, you'll get a shitty low angle shot of your face and [[your mom]]'s office floor.
#Take a picture of yourself frowning.
#Turn on whichever filter gives you the most fucking win.
#[[????]]
#[[PROFIT]]
