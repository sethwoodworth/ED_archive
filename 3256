Gay Teen Forum
[[Image:Faggottree.jpg|thumb|right|What is it?]]

Most boys, upon reaching the sacred age of [[13-year-old_boy|thirteen]], decide that there are several activities that he enjoys taking part in: [[Guitar Hero]], [[XBox]], and lusting over [[lesbian]] [[pornography]]. These boys even will take part in [[Rape|social rites]] in order to acquire a [[pussy]] to play with. Some boys choose to reject nature, [[God]], and social mores, though, deciding that they'd rather rebel against society, their parents, and religion. These boys are known as gay teenagers. They feel alone, for a time, until they discover the [[Internets]].

== Queer Paradise ==

Last Thursday, the vagabonds of [[12chan]] were searching for [[pedo|delicious porn]], and a certain site caught their eye: '''GayTeenForum.org'''.

Upon taking a look inside, they were shocked: there was indeed a plethora of teenage boys just waiting to have penises inserted into their [[Goatse|anuses]]. Between the Introductions, Gay Chat, Self-Pics, off topic, and premium porn section there was plenty of fun to be had. A lot of the self-pics are hot, lol, go sign up and see.

*Niggers aren't welcomed, lol
*Seriously, NO NIGGERS!

To avoid [[bullshit|drama]], please do not add people that do not wish to be outed/added to ED. 


*Anonymous Boy
The forum is his fucking life. Knows too much about everything, loves to talk about how he has Asperger's Syndrome, and is "saving himself for marriage." Claims to be literally repulsed by [[females]]. Gets turned on by moving washing machines. [[Image:pooler.jpg|thumb|120px|PoolerBoy says "OMG ITZ A CHILF!!"]]


*Colin
At 30, way too [[fucking]] [[old]] to be hanging around the forum. Likes to turn every thread into an attempt to show his excessively dry wit off to sixteen-year-olds. His mother is very proud of where he is in life. [[Image:tyra_wary_235.gif|frame|An example of a typical contribution by BJCG.]]


*HuevosGrande<strike>s</strike>
Thinks he's avant-garde and edgy because he's into posting gross pictures. Has an image of himself that he likes to maintain. Threads often start off with "Oh, God, I read the title and I knew it was a Huevos thread!".
Enjoys making picture threads about his bloody (lol) cock. (Seriously, go look at his threads, if you have adult access 70% of them will be about his junk).


*Darcy
Some Aussie fag that's studying interior design. Good fucking grief. [[Image:Latex booty girl.jpg|thumb|100px|Typical image uploaded by Alarhardt as an avatar.]]

Stereotypical [[gay]] [[nerd]]. Dates a [[guy]] he met on the [[forum]]. Is really [[fucking]] [[cute]]. Named himself after some Battlestar Galactica character or something. Good God.


*PoolerBoy0077
Creepy-ass Mexican pedo. Touches himself...a lot.


*lostpainting
Neoconservative, ephebophilic black metal fan. Girlish shoulders inclining in one direction, fat lesbian hips protruding in the other; splotches of brown rats nests swallowing up pasty, greasy skin; awkward poses and limbs that cry out for instruction all dressed in aesthetic abominations. Smells like [[crabs]]. (Not the seafood kind.) [[Image:LP_in_a_g_string.png‎|thumb|160px|lostpainting wearing his every day clothes.]]


*Horizon
PoolerBoy's object of lust. Otherwise unremarkable.

*[[Paris_Hilton|Alarhardt]]
Hyperactive, compulsive retard, who dreams of becoming a musician, or [[Paris Hilton]]. Has no life, and listens to the same bands all the time. Claims to like [[emo|mathcore]], which is probably a shitty genre of music. Posts way too much. Should leave me alone. Please. Thanks.


*TheXO
Loves getting fucked by black men. [[Image:Thecrackhead.JPG|thumb|120px|TheXO's boyfriend.]]



*<strike>FagMasterMatt</strike> <strike>BlacklightVirus</strike> TheMaster
Underage Australian faggot. <strike>2nd</strike> top post whore. Shoves cucumbers up his ginger ass (not to mention his recent purchase of a dildo and stories about shoving 17 ice cubes up his ass), takes pictures and uploads them to the main image uploader and is "shocked" when they get around, oblivious to the fact everyone knows he actually wanted everyone to see them as he feeds on attention.


*xyz72
Spends all day online, occasionally going to school and doing some pathetic half-arsed job. Obsessed with Asian women, constantly talking about his favorite squinty-eyed deaf female artists and downgrading everyone else who do not compare. A huge hypocrite and a chauvinist, badmouthing everyone who doesn't fit his elitist view on how people should act. Argues with 99% of the board and is up his own ass. Judges peoples appearances, even though he himself is an ugly German knob. Likes to honor his god <strike>[[Fake|JoshEth]]</strike> StevieN.


*Roman
Vexatious n00b who thinks he's Thalido-cide's latest reincarnation. Thinks he's important and is obscenely jealous of Rylan. Says he wants Rylan dead simply because they don't share the same taste in music. Good grief. 



*Marmaduke
Former moderator who now rampages around the forum like a demented ferret desperately trying to make himself sound important. Partial to 200% all-caps.
Loves to drop nachos.


*<strike>Thalido-cide</strike> <strike>Binkley</strike>
<strike>Vile piece of excrement who was banned from GTF as Thalido-cide but somehow managed to grovel his way back onto the forum, possibly by bribing moderators with sexual favors. Embodies everything that's wrong with the human race, but seems proud of it. Will almost certainly be banned again soon enough, if his mutilated corpse isn't found lying in a gutter first. </strike><strike>Closet furry</strike> <strike>Openly furry, his fursona is a badger, PM him if you want to [[Yiff|yiff]] him or if you want him to rate your furry art.</strike> 
Dead.


*StX
Powerhungry self-anointed "Saint" who joined when his imaginary boyfriend cheated on him. Shows up and then disappears for months, but far too [[insane|unique]] to confuse with anyone else. Or to forget. He <strike>rapes</strike> hugs all new members. [[OCD|Once edited a post 34 times after someone had replied to it.]] [[Psychopath|Extremely smart and extremely loving, except to animals.]] Unfortunately, one of the more level-headed posters.


*[[Hermione|Intolerable]]
Self-confessed cunt who spends his days trolling GTF and generally boring everyone who crosses his path. Thinks it's terribly clever to greet all n00bs with the words "HELLO FAGGOT". Insists he's intelligent but has yet to demonstrate this fact. Pokémon freak. His shift key is broken.


*Rylan
Pedo-bait. A kitten in human form. Will either grow up to be a serial killer or a big ball of fluff. Roman's jealous of the attention he receives. 


*Poster_Undefined
Can be summed up in one word - drip. Has repeatedly stated that people are stupid if they are offended by anything they read on the Internet, yet takes offense if anyone dares to say anything negative about pretty much any minority group. Wind him up and watch him babble.

*Tessa
GTF's resident fag-hag. One of the few members who ever posts anything worth reading, and expresses her opinions without trying to make other members feel small - possibly because she's not a self-hating embittered faggot in desperate need of a good lay.


*ILikeBoyss
Odious little shit. Every shade of stupid bundled into one tedious package. Read a few of his posts and you'll understand why some animals eat their young.


*meixner
[[Pedophile|Is in love with Zach]] and enjoys sticking Q-tips in his [[urethra]].


*Riddled
AKA [[crap|Jamesypoo]], basically the founder of operation [[emo|emo]] mode. He looks like Justin Bieber's twink older brother with the voice of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYdwe3ArFWA Will Lyman] (the narrator guy from the Dos Equis commercials, expect British :3). Loves to drink beer because it gives him the buzz to escape his shitty life (Mommy never loves him and Daddy never cared). [[Watersports|Enjoys pissing in his used and discarded beer bottles]] (fetish?) because he's too much of a lazy, licentious alcoholic to walk 10 feet to the bathroom. Has a licence to be drunk at any given time.
He does drugs because it's the cool thing to do and he wants to fit in with the cool kids. When he's high on "dope" he screams at his granny to go get him more beer, if not, he'll beat her to submission.
On one occasion whilst high on ketamine and amyl-nitrates, in one of his delusional drug trips, carved CGNT into his arm instead of CUNT because he's an illiterate fuck. Spell checks with Google, he'll avoid writing on the chat if Google is down (it never is... doesn't realise his proxy is still switched on). The only human being ever to have been know to overdose on marijuana, no idea how the fuck that happened. [[Bullshit|Claims to have out smoked Keith Richards]].
He's the personification of misanthropy, cries himself to sleep because [[Whore|Dandan]] won't have virtual sex with him. His soul is a black hole, anything that comes in contact or goes near him gets sucked in and depressed.


*Monologue
Also known as Fidel Juan, [[closeted|openly homosexual gaysian from Singapore]] who spends the vast majority of his time ordering [[CP|CP]] online with his parents money (sometimes ordering CP to the wrong address when drunk or high on bytes.) He is also known for being a [[Programming|code wizard]], his favorite language being [[C++|Sepples]].

When he's not frantically right clicking and saving .jpegs from the forum to satisfy some sort of repressed, Freudian advocated, power trip he doesn't even realise he has, his grand goal in life is to bone each of the actors who played the Doctor in [[Doctor Who]], (even the dead ones, he claims it's not [[necrophilia]] until rigor mortis sets in.)

He knows more about you than you know about yourself. He knows where you live, he knows your sleep schedule, HE KNOWS WHEN YOU BREATHE. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH_YbBHVF4g This is his favourite song].

Once, at the age of [[over 9000|over 9000]] days, he attempted to build a Dalek replica to rail him, but was beaten shortly after by his impervious mother for maxing out her credit card on real life ore, so he settled in making a Tom Baker Doctor scarf. Probably fails to differentiate between real life currency and WoW gold. Apparently placed on medication there after. 
He keeps himself entertained by ganking low levels with his [[World of Warcraft|mage]] and spending [[months|days]] doing the same shit in an instance for some virtual equipment, his e-peen is huge.

Monologue occasionally goes days without sleeping just to make sure he doesn't miss a thing in the chat. Legend has it he is a rape baby. [[Robot|Has never been known to make a typo... ever.]]


*Bourdain
Thinks he's smart and clever at figuring out obstacles in life, but is ultimately a neophyte. He spends countless hours each day locked in his bedroom due to the lack of extracurricular activities in addition to the lack of having friends causes him to have [[Crazy|sporadic episodes of mania]] (Seriously, check the chat at any given time, he'll be there). His name is [[Gay|César Bourdain]] and he resides in the middle of [[Portugal]]. His [[Your mom|mother]] is his fag hag and his annoying stepfather rapes him <strike>bi-weekly</strike> daily. He also becomes suicidal when shopping orders don't work in his favor. He is a danger to himself. [[Retard|He thinks he's so clever because he knows what 4chan is]], but ultimately fails at life.


*Beegee
He's [[ginger]], therefore he's hated and ignored by everyone. Soulless individual.


[[Image:Tweakerbythespeaker.jpg|thumb|Tweak outside the club.]]

*Tweakerbythespeaker
Tweakerbythespeaker also known as  Cyrano de Bergerac is an 18 year old Capatalist jew from New York. Known for his avant-garde stance on grammar and inability to type a sequence of characters more than 12 letters long whilst structuring a sentence before mashing his enter key between bouts of incoherent fizzing and pseudo-philosophy... Cyrano spends his days popping ecstasy pills and smoking marijuana because "it's the cool thing to do." When he isn't trying to convince everyone how cool he is and why weed should be legal, he trolls the interwebs for pictures of small penises to masturbate whilst saying he isn't a closet ephebophile. Whenever he's losing an argument in an epic way he whips out his cock and thinks that everyone forgets about what's being said and focuses on his [[small|giant]] [[vagina|dick]].
Tweaker feeds on drama, whenever he gets cut drama pours out of the wound on form of a flaming self-centered discussion only he cares about.

== The Spawning of this Faggotry ==

=== The Great Split ===

[[Image:IThinkWeBetterSplitUp.jpg|thumb|left|Obligatory photo]]

GayTeenForum.org came about from GayTeenForum.net. AnonymousBoy was kicked off the site by mods for disclosing Super-Top-Secret Mod Information. Then everyone got really melodramatic about his firing, fashioned themselves revolutionaries, and ultimately created a new site. Today, GayTeenForum.net is littered with stereotypical teenage gay guys, while GayTeenForum.org is home to a bunch of pseudo-intellectual half-wits and quarter-wits. While the .org site is ran by [[pedos]] .net actively works to ban them.

== How [[You]] Can End This Faggotry ==

Most people on the site are aware of what 4chan and /b/ are, and find trolling humorous. Mods are constantly active and ban most trolls. So don't be too fucking obvious. Sneak in slowly, define yourself as a fixture, and be clever. Then, post it on here, lol.

== Complaints About Gayteenforum.org ==

*AngryBobbert@angry.com, of Citrus County, FL

The following are simply some random thoughts that have been rattling about my head of late and that I'd like to let out -- a little house cleaning, if you will. If you disagree with my claim that GTF.o's artifices are definitely not on the up and up, then read no further. It's fine to realize that having to listen to the glossolalia that spews forth from GTF.o's advertisements is not a pleasant experience, but it's more important to know that if GTF.o is incapable of discerning the mad ramblings of money-grubbing malefactors from the wisdom and nuance embedded in a sage's discourse then I seriously doubt that it'll be capable of determining that there are those who are informed and educated about the evils of misoneism, and there are those who are not. GTF.o is one of the uninformed, naturally, and that's why what really irks me is that it has presented us with a Hobson's choice. Either we let it prevent us from getting in touch with our feelings or it'll erect a shrine of solecism. 

*Roger, of New Hampshire, NJ

GTF.o occasionally writes letters accusing me and my friends of being otiose, illiberal phonies. These letters are typically couched in gutter language (which is doubtless the language in which GTF.o habitually thinks) and serve no purpose other than to convince me that it has made a big mistake. Sad, but true. And it'll only get worse if it finds a way to seize control over where we eat, sleep, socialize, and associate with others. By the bye, I wonder if GTF.o really believes the things it says. It knows they're not true, doesn't it? We should be able to look into our own souls for the answer. If we do, I suspect we'll find that GTF.o loves getting up in front of people and telling them that an open party with unlimited access to alcohol can't possibly outgrow the host's ability to manage the crowd. It then boasts about how it'll skewer me over a pit barbecue one of these days. It's all part of the media spectacle that is GTF.o. Of course, it soaks it up and wallows in it like a pig in mud. Speaking of pigs and mud, if we're to effectively carry out our responsibilities and make a future for ourselves, we will first have to rise to the challenge of thwarting GTF.o's uncivilized plans. 

*Poopoo Jones, of Googoo Inc.

GTF.o insists that we should abandon the institutionalized and revered concept of democracy. In the long run, however, it's only fooling itself. GTF.o would be better off if it just admitted to itself that its eccentricity is surpassed only by its vanity and its vanity is surpassed only by its empty theorizing. (Remember its theory that if it kicks us in the teeth we'll then lick its toes and beg for another kick?) Let's be realistic: if one believes statements like, "GTF.o's screeds are Holy Writ," one is, in effect, supporting [[wat|inaniloquent]], intrusive charlatans. 

*Barney, of The Purple Moose Company

Sure, GTF.o can fabulize about how free speech is wonderful as long as you're not bashing it and the polyloquent scofflaws in its Praetorian Guard. That doesn't change the fact that its drug-induced ravings were never about tolerance and equality. That was just window dressing for the "innocents". Rather, GTF.o is the embodiment of everything petty in our lives. Every grievance, every envy, every cynical ideology finds expression in GTF.o. 

*[[Paris Hilton]], of Beverly Hills, CA

Our problem -- and make no mistake about it, it is a severe predicament -- is that we currently lack the resources needed to fight GTF.o hammer and tong. I'm not going to say why; we all know the reason. Please let me explain that GTF.o coins polysyllabic neologisms to make its magic-bullet explanations sound like they're actually important. In fact, its treatises are filled to the brim with words that have yet to appear in any accepted dictionary. 

*Harriet Tubman, of black person City, Nigeria

You are, I'm sure, well aware that GTF.o's slaphappy cronies seem to think they can escape the consequences of their actions. But did you know that GTF.o often tries to prove its points by quoting "authorities" who are in fact nothing more than what I call subversive wisenheimers? GTF.o's trucklers are too indolent to analyze GTF.o's calumnies in the manner of sociological studies of mass communication and persuasion. What's my problem, then? Allow me to present it in the form of a question: How much is the axis of evil paying GTF.o to force some to live by restrictive standards not applicable to others? It's an interesting question and its examination will help us understand how GTF.o's policies work. Let me start by providing evidence that if GTF.o opened its eyes, it'd realize that its concept of team play is sideline sulking. 

*George, of Boston, MA

Because of GTF.o's obsession with incendiarism, its sympathizers are quick to point out that because it is hated, persecuted, and repeatedly laughed at, GTF.o is the real victim here. The truth is that, if anything, GTF.o is a victim of its own success -- a success that enables GTF.o to jump on everything that is written, said, or even implied and label it as either egocentric or repressive. Mankind needs to do more to improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable in our society -- the sick, the old, the disabled, the unemployed, and our youth -- all of whose lives are made miserable by GTF.o. Understand, I am not condemning mankind for not doing enough; I am merely stating that GTF.o wants us to believe that the federal government should take more and more of our hard-earned money and more and more of our hard-won rights. How stupid does it think we are? If you assert that everything GTF.o says is totally and entirely true then you won't understand my answer no matter how carefully I explain it. You won't understand my answer if you profess that those who disagree with GTF.o should be cast into the outer darkness, should be shunned, should starve. However, you have a chance at understanding my answer if you're open-minded enough to realize that if GTF.o thinks that it does the things it does "for the children", then it's sadly mistaken. 

*Jean, of Birmingham, UK

GTF.o may have access to weapons of mass destruction. Then again, I, hardheaded cynic that I am, consider it to be a weapon of mass destruction itself. Astute observers have known for years that GTF.o's sound bites always follow the same pattern. It puts the desired twist on the actual facts, ignores inconvenient facts, and invents as many new "facts" as necessary to convince us that might makes right. During the first half of the 20th century, credentialism could have been practically identified with tribalism. Today, it is not so clear who can properly be called a grotesque, quixotic fence-sitter. GTF.o looks primarily at a person's superficial qualities such as physiognomy and mannerisms. I, in contrast, consider how likely a person is to ratchet up our level of understanding. That's what's important to me. Either way, it keeps missing my point. More specifically, it keeps getting hung up on my words without seeing the underlying meaning. For example, when I say that GTF.o is a faithful student of Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese strategist who advocated demoralizing one's enemy as the highest art of warfare, GTF.o seems incapable of realizing that what I'm really getting at is that the main dissensus between me and GTF.o is that I aver that the general public is finally starting to become aware of GTF.o's duplicity and complicity. It, on the other hand, contends that it holds a universal license that allows it to sensationalize all of the issues. 

*Mary-Anne, of Tokyo, Japan

When a political condition of greed, massive corruption, and diversity of objective is coupled to a social condition of drugs, violence, and discontent, therein exists the perfect environment for GTF.o to elevate lecherous voluptuaries to the sublime. I would like to comment on GTF.o's attempt to associate communism with antiheroism. There is no association. This is a lesson for those with eyes to see. It is a lesson not so much about GTF.o's pathetic behavior but about the way that when GTF.o says that once it has approved of something it can't possibly be narrow-minded, that's just a load of spucatum tauri. This state of affairs demands the direct assault on those headlong attitudes that seek to traduce and discredit everyone but the worst kinds of mumpish meanies there are. 

*Henry, of Oklahoma City, KY

If GTF.o can't stand the heat, it should get out of the kitchen. In hearing about GTF.o's ideologies, one gets the distinct impression that GTF.o can be so rotten it would take your breath away. But there is a further-reaching implication: I would like to give you an example of how odious it can be. GTF.o has admitted that it intends to encourage the acceptance of scapegoating and demonization. Okay, that may have been a particularly bald-faced and unsubtle example but the justification GTF.o gave for preventing me from sleeping soundly at night was one of the most annoying justifications I've ever heard. It was so annoying, in fact, that I will not repeat it here. Even without hearing the details you can still see my point quite clearly: GTF.o undoubtedly yearns for the Oriental despotisms of pre-Hellenic times, the neolithic culture that preceded the rise of self-consciousness and egoism. By the same token, it abhors the current era, in which people are free to institute change. Still, the issue of what to do about GTF.o's nutty, stroppy double standards is far from settled. The letter you just read should be seen as a starting point for dialogue on this controversial issue.
