Vietnam War

The '''Vietnam War''' was started by the [[French]] who were startled by monkeys in southeast [[Asia]] and promptly surrendered to them. Meanwhile, in Hanoi, Ho Chi Min Laden decided that he really liked the color red, so the [[Jewnited States of Americunts|United States]] went [[batshit]] and sent in troops. Some people said this was because the South Vietnamese were fighting against the [[Communism|communists]], but really it was because [[Nixon]] was trafficking drugs.

==Early Causes of the War==

When the Emperor of Vietnam wasn't paying attention, the French invaded Indochina starting with the kitchen. The Emperor let this slide because the French are known to be harmless but then he got pissed when someone ate the last ice cream sandwich in the fridge and decided to kick them out. Just after the Emperor came back from the store to buy more ice cream sandwiches, he found that the [[Japan]]ese had taken over and used his backyard for a barbecue party. Again, the Emperor didn't mind this time since he just wanted to eat his ice cream sandwiches. Later he changed his mind and decided to kick the Japanese out because they wrecked his pool. Meanwhile the French were waiting outside, hiding behind the bushes plotting to take over the kitchen again.

President Harriet E. Truman was still butthurt by how Eleanor Roosevelt [[raped|verbally castrated him]] so he decided to take it out on some random country. By luck he saw that the French are trying to recolonize Indochina and decided to help them. Unfortunately, the French have the habit to surrender and retreat leaving the US army to fend for themselves. He could have left after the French declared defeat (for the [[Over 9000|9,000nth]] time) but he wanted his manhood back so badly he decided to stay and waste more money on a war he can't win and passing the burden to the next sucker in line for Presidency.

==Vietnam Combat innovations==
[[Image:Rooster1.jpg|thumb|left|You know he ain't gonna die.]]
The Vietnam war was a transitional period in warfare and introduced new techniques in [[Modern Warfare|modern warfare]] such as coating entire countries with carcinogens, [[Aircraftkiller|carpet bombing]] rice patties, raping civilians (in a city comically called "My lai," [[unfunny|get it?]]), pwning your ranking officer, selling guns to the enemy for [[drugs]], and blasting Wagner as one flew into combat.

It also was the first war to utilize [[suicide bombing]] as a tactic. However, as the suicide bombers unfortunately chose to use gasoline instead of explosives, [[lulz]] were produced instead of casualties.

Vietnam combat tactics have had a far reaching effect on [[fail|American military policy]]. Before Vietnam, the U.S. [[military]]'s tactic was to fight wars to [[win]] them, by sending in overwhelming firepower and crushing opposition. In Vietnam, however, the United States decided to instead throw a decade long [[rave]] where they got [[pwned]] and later decided to blame [[Britain]] for not helping them, but it was [[awwright|ok]] because they had a chance to try out all those weapons that were too toxic to use on [[Europeans]] in WWII, with [[Collateral damage|absolutely no consequences]]!

==The Peace Movement==

[[Image:Hopper.jpg|thumb|right|Hippies were known for their brutality in dealing with American POW's.]] 

The peace movement was the U.S. military's most dangerous adversary during the war. Unlike The VC or VPA the [[hippies]]' fighting ground was mostly on U.S. soil. Hippies routinely infiltrated American ranks undermining American GI's fighting ability and making pop culture back home in America into one big smelly [[hugbox]].

==Cambodia==
Because Vietnam is all Jungle and stuff a lot of pilots and soldiers got lost (especially with all the drugs they were on) and ended up fighting in neighboring [[France|Cambodia]] and [[France|Laos]]. Honestly it was an easy mistake to make as the national pastime of Cambodia is [[Pol Pot|killing people for no reason and having an outright hatred for westerners]], much like the rural south. Many American soldiers felt right at home with this and brought this sensibility back to Vietnam in places like Mai Lai.

==The End of the War and the fall of Saigon==
The Hippies ultimately won the Vietnam war, causing American Culture to fall apart. In 1972 U.S. troops decided it would be better off to Pull Out of Vietnam and return to the U.S. to become Hells Angels. To get the most lulz out of the situation the Americans decided to pull out all of their troops as quickly as possible while the VPA amassed huge numbers of troops at the South Vietnamese border.

The Americans left and hilarity ensued. The South Vietnamese army was massacred, sending all sorts of US sympathizing Vietnamese clamoring to the U.S. embassy for evacuation. When they got there they were all "Can wree get awlift prease?" and the Marines on duty were all like [[unfunny|"THIS IS <s>SPARTA</s> AMERICA!" *punt*]]. As a result the South Vietnamese all got [[pwned]] and the United States were forever [[butthurt]] at the thought they actually lost a war. To this day, Vietnam veterans still [[cry moar|bitch]] about why they don't get a parade.

==Notable Vietnam [[Veteran|Vets]]==

[[Image:Hanoijane1.jpg|thumb|right|Jane Fonda was one of the most treacherous and cunning VPA commanders of the Vietnam War.]]

* [[John Kerry]] - Commanded a boat on the Mekong and was awarded three purple hearts. Later he decided he didn't like the war (because he kept getting shot) and switched sides to work with the Hippies.
* [[John McCain]] - Napalmed the shit out of Vietnamese villages before being shot down and imprisoned by 'Gooks'.
* John Rambo - Singlehandedly stopped the Tet Offensive with a pistol and a survival knife. Ahhh just kidding! He doesn't exist. He was created as a feeble attempt to make butthurt veteran soldiers feel better because they couldn't fight worth a damn.
* Jane Fonda - Brilliant VPN commander responsible for shooting down John McCain over Hanoi.
* [[Anonymous|John Doe]] - Was a guy that got killed a lot.
* Charlie - Was known in the war for being a really elusive guy that didn't like to surf.
* Forrest Gump -  A retarded guy ho ran reelly fast was gay and likes hiting on black chks in the park.
