Anyone who uses this [[Language|terminology]] is engaging in [[old meme]] fuckery of the highest order. It's incredibly motherfucking obnoxious, ranking up there with [[you|people]] who still find the Flying Spaghetti Monster to be an amusing and original joke.

== History ==

In [[old media]], "for the win" was used on [[television]] game shows such as ''Hollywood Squares''. In the show, a [[user]] would be one square away from winning the game. The user would then select that square, saying "I'll take center square for the win."

The term has retained its spirit, but is now very popular in online [[gaming]] communities such as [[World of Warcraft]] and online [[faggotry]] communities such as [[4chan|4chan.org]].

=== Alternatives ===

Another phrase shortened to FTW - before the days of internets - was ''Free The Whales''.   Most likely used by [http://www.angelfire.com/ego2/firthqueen/porn.html tree-hugging] [[hippies]].

What most people don't realize is that while it is true that the phrase ''for the win'' was used in older game shows, the acronym ''FTW'' originated as a covert way to say "Fuck The World" (Ã  la [http://www.fmylife.com FML]):

:'''FTW''' ('''F'''uck '''T'''he '''W'''orld)
