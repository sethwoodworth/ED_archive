[[Computer science]] is a branch of [[science]] focusing primarily on [[computers]].  It's a popular major in [[college]] because of its popularity amongst [[fanboy]]s, [[blogger]]s, [[aspie]]s and their narrow-minded beliefs on how they believe computers should work.

'''Computer scientists''' are an advanced form of [[fanboy]].

== Ironies ==
* Many computer 'scientists' drop out because of the math workload
* People who do weasel through are often a far cry from "scientists"
* Computer Scientists, contrary to popular belief, do not "tighten up the graphics"

==Skill Requirements==
* A ME, IQ, and MA of 12 or more AND a PB of 6 or less
* Penis of 5" or less
* Must know at least 1 programming language from each of the major families. And no... [[HTML]] doesn't count, [[fags]]
* Get lame jokes such as "Why do Computer Scientists get Halloween and Christmas confused?"

{{main|Microsoft Windows}}
Find a computer scientist who will do a side-by-side, iteration-through-iteration, byte-by-byte comparison of Windows and Mac, KDE and Gnome.  It never happens â€” BECAUSE NOBODY COULD LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH A HELLO WORLD, BYTES ARE SMALL NEWB.  Either the person is an [[open source]], wannabe-humanitarian, anti-capitalist fat fuck on a mission to save the world, or a money-grubbing Windows-using Jew.
