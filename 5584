My Husband ''(variations: the hubby, the other half, the SO, my fiancee)'' is the single most fundamentally important ego validator of the hordes of otherwise vapid, bland, uninteresting women on Livejournal communities.

In both related and unrelated posts, you can reliably use this completely irrelevant disclosure of relationship status pick the insecure neurotic harpies who have squeezed out a couple of kids, cut back their hours at Walmart to part time, and realise that aside from their Harry Potter/Twilight cross-over fanfiction and the growing pile of shitty diapers in the hallway trash can, they have little else in their lives.

Thusly, they feel the need to remind everyone on the Internet that HI I HAVE A HUSBAND! MINE! ALL MINE! '''VALIDATE ME, GODDAMN YOU!'''
