According to [[Wikipedia]], Commander Sir '''James Bond''', (RSPCA, RNLI) - an officer of the British Special Overseas Service (SOS) - has long been a household name and remains a huge influence within the genre like [[Angelina Jolie]]. The "James Bond Theme" - [[Yakety Sax]] - was written by [[scotland|Sheena Easton]]  and was first orchestrated by the Barry Norman for 1962's ''Film '97'', [[internet law|although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years]]. The author, Ian Fleming, based the character on himself but unlike ordinary [[Mary Sue]]s made a fuck load of [[money]].

On April 5 1958 the [[tabloid|New Statesman]] published a review entitled "Sex, snobbery and sadism" [http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2007/02/1958-bond-fleming-girl-sex], part of which reads;

{{squote|The plot can be briefly described. James Bond, an upper-class Secret Service Agent, is sent by his sadistic superior, M., to [[Jamaica]], to investigate [[lost|strange incidents on a nearby island]]. By page 53, Bond's bodyguard, a faithful and brutal [[Negro]] called Quarrel, is already at work, twisting the arms of [[azn|Chinese]] girl to breaking point. She gouges his face with a broken flash bulb, and in return, he smilingly squeezes the fleshy part of her thumb (described by Fleming as the 'Mount of Venus', because if it is well-developed then the girl is 'good in bed') until she screams. ('She's Love Moun' be sore long after ma face done get healed', chortles [[bubba|Quarrel]].) Next, Bond's mysterious enemies attempt to poison her with cyanide loaded [[jenkem]], and then insert a six-inch long venomous [[centipede]] in her [[vagina]]. (She could feel it nuzzling at her skin. It was drinking! Drinking the beads of lady juice!').}}

The book immediately soared to the top of the charts, and has been a favourite on the exam syllabus of English [[school]]s ever since.

==The Films==

The first Bond film, "What's New Pussycat" starred Jewish pedophile [[Woody Allen]] and saw him having madcap adventures on the set of "War and Peace" in South America whilst being chased by a giant GM banana armed with an orgasmotron or something. It starred Tom Jones as M, Diane Keaton as daft hippy spy "Vagina Cunt"  and a young Michael Myers as "boy sex toy number two".

The second Bond film, "Casino Royale" starred David Niven and Daniel Craig as two different Bonds vying for the affections of Sean Bean, probably, whilst the Bond girls were Jane "Honest gov I was born in [[New Orleans]]" Seymour as "Anal Rimjob" and [[white|Halle Berry]] as "Topless Hand Shandy".

The last Bond film, "Goldfinger" ... oh for fuck's sake go look it up on [[Wikipedia]].

==The Gadgets==

*The [[mexico|BangBus]]. Bond cruises the streets look for dumb jailbait to fulfill his beastly public school boy sex on camera.

*The Umbrella. First hint of rain, and Bond whips out something that looks like an ordinary sword stick but which, at the press of a button, forms a miniature canvas roof.

==The real James Bond==

1939: Sir Joseph Madeupname ("M" in the Bond novels) devises a plan to rid Britain of upper class [[homosexual]]s and the Nazis in one fell swoop. He founds SOS - the Special Overseas Service - and using the enticement of a free [[blowjob]] and an enamel badge saying "I licked the Nazis", rounds up all the communist poofs in Oxbridge University and sends them to the country to be roughed up by beefy [[Marines]].

1940: "M" gathers up all the train and plane spotters in the UK and drops them into Nazi-occupied [[France]] to "report back on troop movements" thus ridding the UK of that particular sort of [[asspie|weirdo]] for at least two decades.

1941: British spies sneak into Luftwaffe Headquarters and write "[[London]]" over the city of Coventry on the giant wall map in indelible orange crayon, thus diverting the [[German]] bombers away from important rich people.

1942: Alan Turing, in between bouts of [[anal|bumming]] and being [[emo]], cracks the infamous [[Nazi]] Letter Substitution Code. 

1943: British spies sneak into [[Tokyo]] Imperial High Command and using Letraset (British Empire [[Wog]] Typeface Number 23 "Kanji") re-label Pearl Harbour, [[Hawaii]] as "[[Singapore]]" on all the maps, thereby allowing the British troops in the real Singapore to [[French|surrender]] without a fight.

1944: British intelligence dress a dead [[sheep]] in the uniform of a British officer named Brigader-General Joseph Madeupname (DDT, BAA) and float him into [[holland|Rotterdam]] harbour. In "his" coat is a letter to "his" [[wales|Welsh]] lover that reads "Dear Dyfed, We will be invading Germany through [[Finland]] or possibly [[Albania]] but definitely not [[France|Normandy]]. [[love|Yours for eternity]], Fluffy."

1945: [[Polish]] patriots under the direction of the Special Overseas Service ride a bicycle very fast towards Amon Goeth, [[holocaust|OberJewlighter]] of Upper Szczebrzeszyn in an assassination attempt. When he hears the news Goeth put his eye out with an overly dramatic Nazi [[facepalm]].

1966: England defeats Germany in the [[Soccer]] World Cup putting an end to the Nazi scourge for at least four years.
