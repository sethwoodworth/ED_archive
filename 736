On May 2, 2008, [[moot]] turned [[/b/]] off in an attempt to get everyone to explore the outer reaches of [[4chan]], unaware of the [[drama|shitstorm]] that would follow. Since 7chan was bought by moot and had since been redirected to 4chan's /b/, the [[/b/tard]]s panicked. They proceeded to [[shit bricks]], and instead of going to 420chan's or 711chan's /b/, they quickly went to [[/r9k/]]. /r9k/ was pissed to say the least as /b/'s [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|cancer]] took no time before beginning to run rampant. It didn't take long for people to begin abusing the subject field in /r9k/ to impersonate moot, which quickly led to [[fail|confusion]] and even more /b/tard [[Fag|faggotry]]. As time wore on, more and more /b/tards would wake up to find /b/ down, forcing more and more of them to the other boards. The cancer grew further and consumed /r9k/, /k/, /x/, and /s/ after just 4 hours, including some minor trolling on just about every other board. /b/ was back up a few hours later and the /b/tards migrated back to their natural habitat.
