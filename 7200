==History==

[[Image:Th MikamiTeru.gif|thumb|left|Mikami [[masturbation|in action.]]]]

Sakujo was made famous by a character from [[Death_Note|Death Note]] named Mikami. 
He believed he was given a special gift from [[god|Kami]] when black person mailed him his own [[jenkem|death note]] for use of killing criminals via heart attack.
Mikami took this gift seriously and wrote names in the death note daily, each time letting out a dramatic scream "[[I_came|SAKUJO!]]"
[[Image:Mikami sakujo's himself.gif|thumb|right|Mikami sakujo's for the last time.]]
Also while writing in the death note, Mikami used [[masturbation|exaggerated pen strokes]] followed by [[cum|trails of light]].  
All this physical activity leaves him panting during some episodes, leading many to believe that sakujo'ing is [[technical_virgin|almost a sexual experience.]]

Many thought Mikami was [[Batshit_crazy|batshit]] crazy for his strange affection for his Sakujo'ing time, and they were proven right during the last episode in which he [[guro|stabbed himself in the heart with his pen]].  Blood sprayed everywhere as he sakujo'd himself.

==How to correctly inforce a Sakujo==

Someone bothering you in a chat?  Want them deleted?<br>

Well, thanks to the miracle of '[[rape|Sakujo]]' even you can take care of a troubling [[troll]]!<br><br>Let's see some examples first.

''"/kick Troll555 Sakujo."''

Although this has the basic form, it lacks that something special...<br><br>

''"/kick Troll555 SKAJUZU!"''

This example definitely has some 'oomph' to it, but [[YOU_ARE_DOING_IT_WRONG|lacks proper form]].  <br><br>

"/kick troll555 SAKUJO!"

NOW YOU GOT IT!
