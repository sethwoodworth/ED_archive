''"Pickles the Drummer: [[Ned Flanders|doodily doo, ding-dong doodily doodily doo]]!"''

[[Image:Knightpickles.jpg|right|thumb|Pickles is gonna fuck your shit up.]]

'''Pickles''' is the drummer of the band [[Metal (music)|Dethklok]] from the [[lulzy]] [[Adult Swim]] show ''Metalocalypse''. Pickles [[Shit nobody cares about|and the rest of Dethklok]] are prophesied to bring about the [[Apocalypse]]. As he is both [[Ireland|Irish]] and a [[celebrity]], he displays the most prominent traits that are typical of both: he's a [[ginger|firecrotch]], an [[alcoholic]] and immune to every [[drug]] known to man.

Before Dethklok, Pickles was once in a [[faggotry|glam rock]] band called Snakes 'n Barrels. Those days ended when his hair fell out and he got too old for [[fag|hair metal]] fans to [[fap]] to. He's a native of [[Wisconsin]], comes from a [[Money|rich]] family (including an [[Prison|ex-con]] of an [[Oldfag|older]] [[brother]]), and speaks with a [[lol wut|Yooper accent]].

Pickles happened on [[/b/]], as all [[stupid|cool]] shit does, with a "post your /b/ face" thread. The OP posted Pickles, whose face soon got [[shooped]] on Happy Cat, [[Happy Negro]] and so on. The thread eventually [[404 Error|404'd]], and [[nothing of value was lost]].
