Joe cartoon
[[Image:TorpedoJoe.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from Torpedo Joe, a game in which use must use your <s>torpedo</s> [[penis]] to [[fuck]] gay mermen in the [[ass]]. Whoo-fucking-hoo.]]
Joecartoon.com is an unfunny [[flash]] animation site where a perverted [[faggot]]-[[hillbilly]] creates 10 FPS flash animations of gerbils being shoved up people's asses. Joe's childish sense of humor combined with his slurring voice are conclusive evidence that he is, in fact, a [[retard]].

How does a Down Syndrome-waterhead-retard use Flash? Well, with the cartoons you see on [[Newgrounds]] these days, it must not be very difficult.

== Joe's Income ==

It's a well known fact that Joe lives in a trailer and has no job, money, or anything close to what could be considered a social life. He scrapes out a living by shoving his t-shirts down your throat at every opportunity. He then spends all of this money to fund his team of researchers who have dedicated their lives to find new and interesting ways to get a gerbil up an ass.

== Remember When It Was Funny? ==

Joecartoon is basically the equivalent of [[Stickdeath]] because only [[13 year old boys]] watch Joecartoon.
