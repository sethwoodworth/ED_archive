The '''Gay Nigger Association of America''' is probably the most obscure [[trolling organization]] on [[Earth]]. Their mission is to defend the [[civil right]]s of all [[men]] of both [[Africa]]n and [[homosexual]] descent, and [[crapflood]] the [[LiveJournal]]s and [[Xanga]] [[blog]]s of all enemies of niggerdom and faggotry. Should you come across a GNAA member please consult the Nigger Manual for proper handling procedures.

==Joining the GNAA==
'''First of all...'''

Are you [[Gay|GAY]]?

Are you a black person?

Are you a [[Gay|GAY]] black person?

If you answered "Yes" to all of the above questions, then the GNAA might be exactly what you've been looking for!

* Make a first post in a slashdot thread with the GNAA signature.
* Obsessively watch [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5121649266422516795 Gayniggers from Outer Space], and then [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274518/ratings rate it a ten].
* Join the GNAA [[IRC]] channel, #gnaa on Hardchats (SSL on irc.hardchats.com port 6697)

== Notable trollery ==
The Internet, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Ring Musculaturus II. Its mission: to explore strange new networks, to [[seaking|seek]] out new troll targets, to boldly go where no troll organization has gone before.

If a web app has the ability to take user input and regurgitate it for public viewing the odds are that it has been used as a trollery glory hole by the GNAA. They have countless [[crapflood]]s under their belt, and over two million unique visitors have been referred to their trademark shock site [[Last Measure]].

===Freenode IRC Spam Attacks===
In early January 2010, GNAA VP of Operations [[Rucas]] embedded [[Javascript]] into [[Last Measure]] which would cause visitors using the [[Mozilla Firefox]] web browser to connect to [[Freenode]] and spam arbitrary messages.  This was used to great effect by spamming links to [[Last Measure]], whereby unsuspecting users would visit the links and send out spam, thereby getting [[banned]] themselves, and further propagating the attack.  More technical details of this attack, and a more in-depth view of its effects, are available at [[Firefox_XPS_IRC_Attack]].  This attack also lead to the formation of the GNAA's own security research firm, [[Goatse Security]].

===Slashdot/Xanga Crossruin===
The GNAA was birthed as a Slashdot [[troll]] organization. In late 2004, the GNAA put together a cross-site scripting worm for [[Xanga]], the weblogging service popular among asian trustfund sluts. [http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/12/28/161214/43 They leveraged this power to implant hundreds of thousands of iframes in the weblogs of unsuspecting asian girls]. The target of these iframes? A HTTP GET to Slashdot's search function, exploiting the programmatic replacement of characters which may be used for sql injection to do a SELECT *. Combine this with the comment table which had more than 4GB-- the limit at the time for key caching in mysql-- and you got an actual whole table read for every single iframe. Result: complete and total destruction of Slashdot. 

===Wikipedia, [[YHL]]===
[[Wikipedia]]ns shit themselves every time that the GNAA is mentioned. Since more time is devoted to reverting the GNAA's edits than to writing new material, Wikipedia is doomed to being trolled forever. The GNAA article has now been put up for a vote for deletion more than any other article on Wikipedia. It has been nominated for deletion a World Record 18 times. Finally, it was deleted on the eighteenth nomination, even though a consensus had not been reached. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America_%2818th_nomination%29 ] Not only that, Wikipedia article on GNAA was nominated as featured article candidate, however for some reason it did not achieve featured article status. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America ]

[[Image:Gnaa-wikipedia-assault.jpg|thumb|GNAA crapfloods [[Wikipedia]] IRC channel into oblivion]]
Some dumb bitch in [irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia #wikipedia] said that the GNAA should be shut down with the USA's Patriot Act. Thankfully the assembly of Gayniggers is multinational and no longer vulnerable to the actions of a single country. With the advent of enterprising Gayniggers springing up in over a hundred countries around the world, organizations like the GNAR have recently gained large membership bodies.

===Pissing off [[Apple]] [[hipster]]s===
*[[JesuitX]] leaked screenshots of OS X 10.4 Tiger a few days before its release. As the leak came from the GNAA, countless battles on forums erupted over whether or not the screenshots were genuine. 
*GNAA trolled basement-dwelling Apple hipsters yet again, releasing a BitTorrent ISO of a supposed x86 version of OS X shortly after the announcement that Apple would be switching to Intel hardware. Tens of thousands flocked to download the torrents only to find that their new warez merely booted an image of hello.jpg. Coverage of the hoax in [[old media]] sources like major newspapers, CNN, [http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/laptops-pcs/macindell-part-quatre-the-ruby-goldmine-107940.php Gawker], and G4 may mark the first instance of the word "[[goatse]]" being mentioned on cable television.

===[[Asperger's Syndrome|Aspie]] [[fanboy]] [[gay|fgtz]]===
To the dismay of many [[Harry Potter]] fans, the GNAA were the initial propagators of [[The Great Dumbledore Dies Meme of 2005]]. They also released a fake copy of Half-Blood Prince on BitTorrent a couple weeks before the book's release. It was filled with [[goatse]] and [[pain series]]. Result: the greatest [[hugbox]] shortage in all aspie history.

The GNAA also trolled [[animu]] fgtz by releasing a copy of [[Gay Niggers from Outer Space]] disguised as some lame shit called [[Animu#Naruto|Naruto]]. Result: thousands of animu fgtz had the courage to come out of the closet and are now living happy lives in which they no longer have to hide their sexuality.

===Various ruins===
In October 2005, GNAA member [[Grog]] received "staff" status on the Freenode IRC network from [[Rob Levin]] by posing as Greg Lehey, developer of FreeBSD and MySQL, who happened to have a similar IRC nickname. Grog proceeded to unjupe #GNAA, jupe several of the more popular channels including: #wikipedia, #linux, and #solaris, gline half the network and delink all the servers.

Then Grog told lilo that his daughter's unpatched XP machine had been compromised, got his staff access back, and did it all over again.

On March 3, 2006, GNAA member [[JacksonBrown]] [[DNS]] spoofed the wireless network at the San Francisco Apple Store, where This Week in Tech were recording their 44th podcast; the result: anyone who went to a website was redirected to Goatse. Leo Laporte briefly talked about this ordeal [http://twit.tv/44 in the podcast, around the 05:35-06:30 mark].

== Revival ==
On Friday the 13th, 2009 [[Dikkv|DiKKy Heartiez]] joined [irc://irc.gnaa.eu/gnaa #gnaa] on [[KLULZ|Hardchats]] and began spamming various [[troll]] [[irc|hangouts]] in an attempt to reunite old members of the GNAA and recruit new ones. Word spread, and he soon had others doing the same, building a good size chan of old-timers.

[[jesuitx]] was impressed enough with the reunion to point irc.gnaa.eu to hardchats, and the GNAA was officially reborn.

After some time it was revealed that DiKKy's last name was actually Heartenstein, and that he was a tyrannical Jew.

After weeks of suffering under DiKKy's limp-wristed and ineffectual rule, the GNAA resolved to hold open elections on Friday, January 1st 2010 to usher in a new year of gay nigger dick. Elections were broadcast live on the [[l0de]] radio hour, with candidate debates and live Y/N/MARE viewer polls. Our own [[weev|Andrew Weevlos]], attorney at lol, came out on top, beginning a new era of gayniggerdom.
