Parrotheads

'''Parrotheads''' are Jimmy Buffett [[fanboi]]s who are renowned for their love of [[cosplay]], [[drunk|drunken]] [[faggotry]] and such extreme levels of [[douchebag|douchebaggery]] that they are hated by almost everyone outside their little [[TOW|cult]]. 

==Who they are==
[[Image:Buffettdouches.jpg|thumb|We have a yacht, but we're chill about it. It has been confirmed that [[theredskull|Jamie Demeter]]'s parents are on the left]]
According to [[South Park]], "nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the south." This is [[fact|true]]. But a lot of Jimmy Buffett fans are also [[old]] [[rich]] guys who got rich by selling out but think that they can stay [[hipster|hip]] and stay in touch with their youth by drinking beer with other rich old guys wearing Hawaiian shirt while listening to some fat [[rock|rawk]]. However, several of their premises are incorrect.

Jimmy Buffett was never hip. He was a product of the [[hippie|seventies]] mindset, which was fueled by [[drug]] use, of "I'm ok, you're ok" and of not being hassled by [[the man]]. Jimmy Buffett's especially lame iteration of this philosophy revolves around drinking lots of rum in the Caribbean and having absolutely [[lazy|no motivation]]. The fact that Buffett is worshipped by lots of khaki-wearing corporate whores who have [[fellatio|worked]] their way to positions of high power is hilarious [[irony]]. Of course, many of these men were ex-[[frat]] boys themselves.

Perhaps fittingly though, Jimmy Buffett does not really make music anymore himself and instead heads up a corporate empire centered around a [[shit]] chain restaurant that sells overpriced margaritas and [[Cheeseburger|cheeseburgers]] (LIKE THE SONG "CHEESEBURGER IN PARADISE" OMG GET IT!!1!). He heads a media empire envied by even Gene Simmons that is expert in making money off his fans. Hilariously, Jimmy is himself a [[liberal]] who espouses a lot of [[liberal guilt]]. Undoubtedly, he does not see [[hypocrite|any conflict]] between his beliefs and his love for Jew gold. 
 
All Parrotheads want to [[fellatio|suck Jimmy's cock]] and would make every concert into a [[Lemon Party]] if they could. That means that all the old rich guys and frat boys are total [[faggot]]s. On the plus side for Jimmy, that means that there is a lot of [[jb]] willing to give up [[ass|pooper]] that he doesn't have to compete for. Of course, a lot of parrotheads are [[fat]] hausfraus.

In short, Parrotheads are Deadheads with more money and less integrity.

==Cosplay==
[[Image:Parrotheadtits.jpg|left|thumb|Cock goes where?]]
Parrothead [[cosplay]] involves donning some sort of embarrassing tropical regalia and basically looking like a total [[faggot]], like any other sort of cosplay. However, because it is done by people who are [[rich and beautiful]] and not pasty [[animu]] [[basement dwellers]] who fap to [[yaoi]], it is somehow more acceptable. Dressing up can go from the classic and simple grass skirt, to a baseball hat, hawaiian shirt and khaki pants. Basically, you have to dress in a manner that tells the world that you are a total [[douchebag]] and don't give a fuck about anything else.  

==Parrotheads OTI==
They are [[srsly]] everywhere on the internet, and like [[anonymous]], they come from all walks of life. They are also scarily well organized with local chapters in your town as well as everywhere else, except for [[Africa]]. There are [[no niggers]] in the Parrotheads and in fact, joining the parrotheads is a way of showing your [[Stormfront|racial pride]]. Many of these chapters have their very own online forums and websites and they hold regular events that involve [[cosplay]], [[alcohol|alcoholism]], bad singing and little else.

==Trolling Parrotheads==
[[Image:Jbparrotheads.jpg|thumb|lolis love Jimmy Buffett]]
*Tell them that Jimmy is actually a country musician. This is [[true]], but parrotheads consider themselves to be above the typical redneck country music fan. 

*Replace one of their sites colorful tropical backgrounds with [[goatse]] or other [[shock site|shock images]]

*Ask them why there are no black parrotheads and accuse them of being [[racist]]. Because a lot of parrotheads have [[white guilt]], they will protest but they won't be able to address the fact that there are no black parrotheads.
