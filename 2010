'''Dane Cook''' is God's gift to both mankind and comedy. No, just kidding, he's actually an unfunny fucking cunt. I mean, absolutely asshole-suckingly awful. He is an [[unfunny]] hack who must have sold his [[virginity|soul]] to the Dark Lord [[Satan]] himself to become famous. It is a known scientific fact that at any given time, wherever funny is, Dane Cook is no less than [[over 9,000|several thousand]] miles away from it.

==Why is Dane Cook?==

[[Image:Doncok.jpg|thumb|[[Woll Smoth|Don Cock]] *fixed]]

Dane Cook was created by Hollywood [[Jews]] for the purpose of a mass-produced, non-offensive [[Jeff dunham|puppet of a man]] to [[rape|please]] frat boys and sorority girls.  

He's headlined a tour, had an HBO Special, and has been on several talk shows. Why? To force feed [[you]] the belief that he is actually [[unfunny|funny]]. He is engineered to be what the American public wants: inoffensive, white, male, and he could be the kid next door.

==Summing up his style and career==

Cook boldly represents a Jew brand of 21st Century comedian; a comedian whose act doesn't rely on being funny, but instead puts more emphasis on leaving any poor soul who happens upon one of his shows with the feeling that they were repeatedly kicked in the balls (or ovaries). This may seem contrary to what [[common knowledge|common sense]] would indicate (<i>especially considering the [[Over 9000|fucking insane levels]] of popularity that he has gained</i>), and so [[some argue|one might argue]] that this [[Douchebag|douche-bag]] must have told a good joke at some point in his career. They would be wrong. In [[Last Thursday|days gone by]] a comedian actually had to be [[Funny|amusing]]; but not any more.  All he has to do is say, "[[Cleveland steamer]]," and he gets laughs galore, although the [[Cleveland steamer|steamer]] is exponentially less funny than a jar of piss.

As an "actor" in such recent films as ''Dan in Real Life'', ''Good Luck Chuck'', and ''Employee of the Month'', Dane Cook is [[facepalm]] [[fail]].

== Dane Cook: [[Camwhore]] ==
Dane Cook made himself famous on the [[internet|interbutts]] through his [[MySpace]] which now has over two million "[[friends]]". This alone launched his superstar "comedy" career. As such, he is the most successful [[attention whore]] the Informationweb Supernetwork has ever created.

Making a video about "lolz I gots 2 million friends and you don't"? Really, Mr. Cook, if you really think that this is a notable accomplishment in any way, then you should [[an hero|become an hero]].

^^Notice how the other actors are funny...but still not Dane Cook.

== The Fans ==
Dane Cook is popular among [[orangeskin]] [[retard]]s and people who have never heard any other stand-up comic in their life. Dane Cook's comedy routines usually consist of telling [[IRL|real-life]] stories and trying to make them [[funny]] by making the sort of [[Goatse|exaggerated expressions]] and voices that you might expect from a [[Pedophilia|first-grade]] class clown, while never actually saying anything funny.

He's also been well known for blatantly Jew material from funnier and more [[Original content|original]] comedians, most notably HBO's [[Louis CK]] [http://www.redban.com/blogy/?p=51 1]. Both fans and critics of Cook tend to take this [[serious business|way too seriously]] and [[shit]] themselves over it, creating lots of [[lulz]].  

His more [[virgin|devoted]] fans [[typical]]ly defend him with [[Fail|laughable]] or just plain [[Bullshit|trite explanations]], which include the following:

{{quote|He tells it how it is!!|[[Fag]]}}

{{quote|Everyone who 'bashes' Dane and the work he does needs to shut their mouths until they [[buttsecks|get to know the real him!!]][[111]]|[[Fag]]}} 

{{quote|He didn't steal from Louis C.K, [[bullshit|he made it better]]!|[[Fag]]}}

{{quote|the man is hystericalllll. you have to whatch like all his skits <3|[[cunt]]}} 

{{quote|[[pretty cool guy|I think Dane Cook is a pretty cool guy. eh talks about his RL experiences and doesn't afraid of anything]]|[[Fag]]}}

{{quote|Dear Dane Cook, Hi my name is Nic. I am a 7th grade student from Holmen, Wisconsin. For my keyboarding class we have to write a letter to our favorite actor and you were my first choice. The ways you inspired me is you make me laugh when I am down because I recorded some of your...[[Porn|talk shows]] on my ipod. I love all of your movies. I will tell you some of my favorites. Dan in Real Life, Employee of the Month, and my personal favorite Good Luck Chuck. From your words you made me make other people laugh. My favorite talk show is the one about your brother and you working at Burger King, it is hilarious. I have a question for you I was wondering if you were scared on your first talk show. Because I might be a comedian when I get older.
Sincerely, Nic Schecke|[[Fag|Too young to know better]]}}

When the truth is

{{quote|I once misread his name as 'Dane [[Cock]]' after watching some of his 'comedy' on youtube.|[[Truth|Unwittingly accurate]]}}

{{quote|[[Truth|Fuck Dane Cook, he's a cunt.]]|[[Louis CK]]}}

{{quote|[[Truth|Dane Cook is as funny as being force to watch two and half man marathon.]]|[[Truth]]}}

(Predictably enough, 98[[%]] of these virulently defensive [[fanboy|hero-worshiping]] [[luser|comedy groupies]] have never even had the opportunity to exchange a few brief words with the [[Rich and beautiful|disinterested]] [[unfunny|hack]] at one of his shows.)

== How To Do Stand Up Like Dane Cook ==
[[Image:Dane_cook_fan.pngâ€Ž|thumb|A reasonable response to criticism of Dane Cook by a reasonable fan.]]
[[You]], too, can write your own joke! It's easy! Just follow the formula below:
*Start out with "So the other day,"
*Talk about [[Masturbation|some mundane activity that everyone does]]. This is sure to build a connection with the [[Fucktard|audience]]. They'll be thinking, "Wow. [[Fag|He's just like me]]. I do that too!" (See Also: [[Linkin Park]] Song writing formula)
*Repeat what you did [[At least 100|at least 3]] times, then yell it back again and add the word "fucking."
*Wait for all the [[furfags|females]] in the crowd to finish [[Orgasm|screaming]].
*Add some ridiculous, [[Bullshit|unrealistic]] aspect to the story. <b>[[PROTIP]]:</b> Create your own word for extra laughs!
*Mention one of your [[Old meme|old jokes]]. [[Fanboys]] who have heard this joke will [[yiff|clap]] appreciatively.
*Go off on a tangent telling another story. Return to step 1.
*Return to the original story, which you almost forgot about due to an extreme case of [[Asperger's Syndrome|ADD]].
*Exaggerate. Every. Single. Detail.
*Become the [[Rape|victim]] of the story as it progresses.
*Violently thrust your body around. Just imagine you're epileptic. Don't worry about the context of your story! Most of the audience is too dense to follow more than a sentence or two at a time. 
*Insert another small tangent here. Don't forget to keep saying "fucking."
*In a fell swoop of Deus Ex Machina, overcome the odds and become the [[A_winner_is_you|victor]] of your story. The more unrealistic the victory, the better.
*Add a tangent on how you would further achieve victory in the most ridiculous way possible.
*Nod your head and say "Yeeeeeeah, that's right!" to the crowd as they give you the first of numerous standing ovations that will follow each and every subsequent "joke".
