Legal action
{{elaw}} [[Image:Legal_rampage.png|thumb|190px|left|Jack Thompson visits Rockstar.]] Occasionally referred to as [[lethal action]], '''legal action''' is what [[faggots]] and [[Internet tough guys]] resort to when someone makes them angry [[OL]]. Many "victims" of [[LJDrama]] and [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] have threatened legal action against their oppressors. 

In Austria there have however been some successes, including the removal of a user from the Internet in June 2003 in Queanbeyan, New South Wales, Australia, and a succesful internet stalking charge in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia in April 2006. This is because Austria is run by a bunch of [[Nazi]] fucks.

It should be noted that when ED threatened legal action against Uncyclopedia, they promised to give up the ED logo. This proves that Uncyclopedia is scared [[shit|shitless]] of us.

The lesson here is that [[The Internet is serious business|THE INTERNET IS SERIOUS FUCKING BUSINESS]], so don't get your ass sued off by an [[nigra|irate]], [[feminist|irrational]] [[fucktard|individual]].
