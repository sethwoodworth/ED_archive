Monthly Collectibles
{{pixplz}}

'''Monthly Collectibles''', aka '''Donation Items''', aka '''Bifortnightly Pixel Masturbations''' are monthly items you receive by donating $2.50 on [[Gaia Online]]. Unlike most of the items you get, these items usually come in sets, which really pisses off the [[Gaiafags]] (mainly the "Oldbies") because they feel their [[erection|hard work]] has gone to waste. Not to mention it [[cut|cuts]] the value of most of the past items (which REALLY sets off the [[gaiafags|Oldbies]]). In fact, donation items are one of the biggest things Gaiafags will complain about.  Some will quit because of recently released items.  Donation items show that Gaiafags have no life whatsoever.

<s>Items are released on the 15th usually at Noon PST</s> <s>HAHA DISREGARD THAT, they're now released on the 8th</s> Gaia has decided to return it to the 15th because they thought it confused people and oldfags kept complaining about it. That doesn't stop the flood of fucktards asking "OMG WHY MAH LETER ISNT OPEND??!!!" at midnight in their time zone!

== Lanzer's fear of Lawsuits ==
Apparently the Gaia leader [[azn|Lanzer]] decided to have the name Donation Items changed to Monthly Collectables. This is because he felt this "confused users" (more like set off the authorities to sue him for soliciting donations for fake items, [[amirite]]?).  ([[YTMND|That seems familiar]]). Ironically, after the change, people DID get confused, which lead to a ton of drama.

== Stolen MEMES ==

'''[[Chuck Norris|Chyaku Norisu]] Scarf'''

Failure upon failure. They took an [[Old meme]], [[Lulz|corrupted]] it, and [[Weeaboo]]-ified it. His tears cure canceru! ^_^ ^_^

'''ORLY Hat'''

In September of 2006, Gaia modfags decided to steal ORLY.<br>
1. Make meme into hat<br>
2. Sell hat to gaiafags through monthly collectibles system<br>
3. ??????<br>
4. PROFIT!!

--Perhaps the only time [[PROFIT]]!! actually works in the equation.

==[[Hookers and blow]], on my Gaia Online?==

Apparently l0cke had more than a majority vote in releasing the onslaught of new items, both for Christmas, and [[lie|a garage sale of unreleased items]].  Not content with the illusion of a Fouty from yellow bottles they already had, and bikinis that would make [[Paris Hilton]] think twice, they have introduced [[jenkem|"black coal"]], [[hookers and blow|"white coal," Japanese smoking pipes, slutty Christmas attire]], [[alcohol|tequila, and gin]], among other new kinds of [[faggotry|fun]] into the mix.  <s>We haven't even seen monthly collectables yet, but all the black person youth are probably hoping for something to free-base to.</s> [[penis|An ice sword]], some bullshit [[KKK|snow-cloak]], and a bunch of [[timecube|steam-punk clocks]]...way to be original, what, by just making another LITERAL polar-opposite of the [[gay|flaming]] [[cock|sword]], and [[shit no one cares about|shit no one's going to wear in another week]].

==Animu Faggotry==
In February '08, Gaia decided to pander to [[Weeaboo|their userbase]] by releasing some [[Gay|pink]] Sailor Moon outfit, hoping to attract more [[Whore|women]] to the site. This backfired, and now all the males use it to do [[cosplay]] [[Cybersex|cybering]]. There was also some kind of [[Catnarok|apocalypse]] thing, but [[nobody gives a shit]].
