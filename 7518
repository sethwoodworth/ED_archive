Silvertree
[[Image:Feminist_symbol.gif|thumb|right|Silvertree is a [[anti-feminist]].]]
{{lj|user=silvertree}} is one of today's major opponents to The Man, Tampax, and the oppressive culture of mainstream [[Wicca]].  To begin our journey towards better understanding this reputation and the magnificent woman behind it, we should first examine her public persona, followed by her semi-private (or "God I wish this were private") self-image.

==Silvertree's Public Image==
[[Image:You_win_the_prize.jpg|thumb|left|Silvertree hates this boy.]]
Silvertree presents Livejournal with a number of faces. Her [http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=silvertree userinfo] claims many labels, including [[menstrual activist]], [[pagan]]-[[atheist]], [[intelligent]], [[feminist]], [[bisexual]], [[asexual]], hater of those with an IQ under 100, and British Airways lackey. The veracity of these statements has been largely disproven. 

===Silvertree as Community Moderator===

Silvertree moderates several communities on Livejournal, as noted in her userinfo. Perhaps the most notable of these is {{ljcomm|user=menstrual_lib}}. In this community, Silvertree fervently spreads her gospel of "anything that is natural is automatically good." She encourages women to ignore biased Tampax ads, [http://www.livejournal.com/community/menstrualhut/1821622.html?thread=8950454#t8950454 and to instead ask competing companies for their unbiased opinion of their main competitor]. The community's [http://pics.livejournal.com/silvertree/pic/0002t6fe logo], created by {{lj|user=soul_tremor}} during her heavy flow (and later [http://www.livejournal.com/community/blood_art/54657.html#cutid1 graciously shared] with {{ljcomm|user=blood_art}}), epitomizes the community's loud and proud message of "Damn you Tampax for not letting me bleed all over everywhere."
Silvertree is also known for drama in her community {{ljcomm|user=wiccan}}.  She is a strong supporter of the "Wicca countermovement", often upsetting teen Charmed fans.

===Silvertree as Community "Contributor"===
Silvertree is perhaps best known as a spreader of knowledgable, rational advice in sex communities. For instance, [http://www.livejournal.com/community/menstrualhut/1262411.html?thread=5606987#t5606987 here she soundly corrects one poster who claims that "tampons leave stuff inside you" is a myth, teaching the wayward poster that Snopes is just part of a grand tampon conspiracy]. In fact, she often tells posters that tampons are evil and dangerous. She also claims that [http://www.livejournal.com/community/menstrual_cups/290072.html?thread=2285848#t2285848 nothing dangerous is ever sold]. She also once told a poster on a Christianity community that [http://www.livejournal.com/community/christianity/1065172.html?thread=13607124#t13607124 prejudice is okay as long as you really, really believe in it].

==Silvertree's Semi-Private Image==
While a general portrait of Silvertree can be formed from her public writings, her supposedly private writings also offer a more detailed look into her persona. Her own journal, of course, is a good place to start.  However, her journal has been [[Friends only]] for some time.  But once upon a time, her journal featured a variety of logically argued essays, including one claiming that [[Michael Jackson]] should be acquitted because he is a [[pedophile]] not an active. 

In the comments of her friends' journals, one can glean facts about her family life: for instance, [http://www.livejournal.com/users/english_peach/49255.html?thread=1282407#t1282407 her family used to breed chipmunks]. Glimpses into her asexual/bisexual sex life can also be gleaned, as she tells a friend [http://www.livejournal.com/users/english_peach/48678.html?thread=1259558#t1259558 that she thinks orgasms are boring]. However, her personality begins to develop more fully when we begin to examine her posts to various communities. For instance, [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ld_adults/10606.html her post to LD Adults] discusses how she is a victim of, well, everything. And in Menstrual Hut, she [http://www.livejournal.com/community/menstrualhut/1811880.html?thread=8889512#t8889512 opines about her massive loss of blood from her vagina]. And lest we forget--[http://www.livejournal.com/community/fetishconfess/339420.html?mode=reply she's interested in pony play]!
