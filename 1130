Bradford Cox
[[Image:BradCox3.JPG|right|thumb]]'''Bradford [[Cocks|Cox]]''' is a [[Shit nobody cares about|critically acclaimed]] musician who performs in the bands '''Deerhunter''' and '''Atlas Sound'''.  He runs [http://deerhuntertheband.blogspot.com Deerhunter's blog] and posts regularly about his life and new songs that he writes.  He is also one of the biggest [[lolcow|lolcows]] in all of indie rock.  Did I mention his last name is "Cocks"?


=== Personal life ===

Cox is afflicted with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome Marfan Syndrome], a genetic disorder that causes sufferers to be very tall, with long limbs and a predisposition to [[Gay|teh ghey.]]  When Deerhunter first started to receive hype, his appearance was heavily discussed, and some speculated that he was a drug addict or anorexic.  It turned out that he actually has a disease that just makes him look like an anorexic heroin addict.

In keeping with his status as an Internet attention whore, Cox regularly talks about his [[Gay|ambiguous sexuality]] on his blog and in interviews.  
*When touring in support of their 2007 album, he would wear dresses (see picture).  
*In July 2007, he posted regularly about guitarist Lockett Pundt's [[scat|defecation]], including [http://deerhuntertheband.blogspot.com/2007/07/poop-journal-entry-one.html photos] and [http://deerhuntertheband.blogspot.com/2007/07/i-have-composed-haiku-about-locketts.html poetry].  While Cox clearly did it for the [[lulz]], it resulted in bassist Colin Mee [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/45312-guitarist-colin-mee-explains-why-he-left-deerhunter leaving the band].
*A couple of July 2007 entries explored [[Shotacon|adolescent male sexuality]] (one has been taken down; another, titled [http://deerhuntertheband.blogspot.com/2007/07/little-ricky-caught-whacking-it-more.html "Little Ricky Whacking It"], is still posted), prompting a [[Pitchfork Media]] [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/44194-deerhunters-cox-explains-recent-blog-posts interview] in which he revealed that he had been [[Pedobear|molested at age 7]] and was a virgin.
{{quote|[[tl;dr|First of all, if you do not like what i'm about don't read this blog or buy our records or come see us play. If you think we are overhyped and shitty then find another band that strikes your fancy and go hang around their blog. I am not trying to shock anyone. To those who recognized it, yeah, Dennis Cooper is a huge influence on me since I was about 15. I highly recommend his blog (denniscooper-theweaklings.blogspot.com). Now onto something more serious... Don't even think about pulling this child pornography shit with me. I have not used a single image that did not come from a legitimate site that keeps age records. Child Pornography is fucked up, and as someone who was sexually abused since I was seven, I take it pretty seriously. I don't need thought police on here. You can eat the shit you'll be seeing photos and journal entries about in the next day. I can't help it that some of you think I am sick or fucked up or twisted. My job is to express myself how I best know how. Usually a mixture of sadness and humor. I was really writing about lonliness. I don't feel like I need to defend the fact that I am fucked up because I was fucked with and sexually abused at a VERY young age. At this point in my life I am a 25 year old virgin with a body image that decreases exponentially everytime some dipshit with a blog takes a jab at how ugly I look. I don't blame myself for my adolescent fantasies because I am still an adolescent, looking for someone to connect to, I guess. Sorry to get all serious but I don't need this shit from cunts that come here expecting "Shock and Awe". That's not what we are about. We are about honesty. Everyone shits. Honestly. And everyone has fucked up things they hide. I show mine with a sense of humor.]]}}

=== ''Weird Era Cont.'' Leak ===

On August 16, 2008, Cox uploaded an Atlas Sound "Virtual 7-inch," a two-track EP, to Mediafire.  Although he didn't have an account with Mediafire, Mediafire stored the files he uploaded in a folder.  A curious fan looked through the directory and found two unmastered releases: ''Weird Era Cont.'', a bonus disc to accompany Deerhunter's upcoming album Microcastle, and ''Logos'', an unreleased Atlas Sound record.  That fan posted a link in the comments section of the Deerhunter blog with links to both.  Instead of rationally deleting the post and seeing what he could do about taking the unreleased albums off of Mediafire, Bradford simply lost his shit.

Fuck this shit. I can just make another album. It's not finished and now it never will be. It was also going to have a rad cover. 
i would describe it to you but that would be stupid. P.S. there are no vocals on Quick Canal. I never got the chance to record them. 
This record was not free to record, so if you'd like to pay for hearing it send a paypal donation to 
lastdeerhunteronearth@yahoo.com. I am not a fucking opportunist so don't think I expect it.}}

I have no idea what people want me to do. I'm not trying to be a cunt to anyone. I will finish the fucking album and stop bitching. I honestly really truly do not want attention from this. Sincerely. I wish none of this shit would have happened. I was just trying to give away another virtual 7". Now everyone that reads this thing is going to think i'm a fucking lunatic. I just have nothing to do. I guess I'll go clean my room.}}

Then he tried to destroy the evidence, which [[fail|failed]].  Now Cocks is keeping a low profile and interviewing [[Soulja Boy]] [http://www.pressplayfashionforward.com/2008/09/when-bradford-met-soulja-boy.html] until the new Deerhunter album, ''Microcastle,'' is released.
