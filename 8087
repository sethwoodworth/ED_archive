Tennessee
[[Image:Tennessee resident.jpg|thumb|Stay strapped]]

'''Tennessee''' is a bible-belted shithole state located in The South and is the epicenter of cousin fucking [[ICP]] fans, inbred hicks, and other degenerates that all make up the mythical land of [[drugs|meth]] and [[booze]].  It is also said that one can hear banjo music from anywhere in the state.  This is true.

'''WARNING''':  ''By reading the following, your IQ will drop [[at least 100 years ago|at least 47 points]].  It will still be higher than anyone in Tennessee, however.''

== The myth ==
[[Image:Popcorn-sutton.jpg|thumb|One of Tennessee's founders.(RIP POPCORN SUTTON: AN HERO)]]
In the year 1700 or at least around that time, the mutants from the south were looking for El Dorado, the land of cheap [[Viagra]] and [[dickgirl|shemale]] [[prostitutes]]. They believed that it existed between Kentucky, Virginia, and Canada. They looked and looked but only found a lot of dirt and the remains of savagely whipped slaves. From that day forth they called the land "Ten A Key" in accordance with that being the amount of money for a kilo of coke. To make it seem more mythical, or possibly because somebody who wrote history was drunk off moonshine and exhausted from sleeping with their uncle, they named the state Tennessee.

== Regional Divisions ==
Instead of the land of [[traps|whores]] and gold and country music, they ended up with a massive dirt plain with a giant forest on one end and [[niggers]] at the bottom. Although technologically primitive, the [[niggers|people]] have managed to survive since about [[100 years ago]].

Tennessee can be subdivided into 5 distinct areas, and 1 molten swamp of Grits & Chitins. The four regions are the Northeast, Midwest, True South, [[Niggers|Cashville]], and a chain of active volcanoes.

'''Northeast''':
The Northeast is a region in Tennessee that borders very closely to Virginia. In fact it boards so close that the typical Ugnaw from either State couldn't tell the difference between one another. Although typically people from this area of Tennessee are morbidly obese, have beards to their belly buttons and talk about why the NRA was the best idea in the world. Avoidance of said people is as easy as not getting lost in the woods. There are no real homes in this area as a visitor can never see them during a trip through the area, but instead holes in the ground provide a subterranean society of mole people and pot growers. 

'''Midwest''':
The Midwest is the home to [[God]]awful people such as country musicians and [[16 year old girls]] ([[Miley Cyrus]]). In this region groups of prospectors looking for booze set up encampments in what is known as the city of Nashville. This city lacks electricity and running water, unless you count alcohol, which flows like Niagra Falls.

'''West''':
[[Image:PyramidArena.jpg|thumb|[[WTF|Land of the ancient pyramids.]]]]
This is the border line of Tennessee and all truly southern states. The main population lives in Memphis. Its only inhabitants are [[rednecks]] who spend their time drinking and bitching about how lazy the [[niggers]], the majority of the population, are. [[Elvis]] lived here, which resulted in his overdose and death. Outside of Memphis there exists practically nothing but trees, the random drunk fucking his goat, and [[skinhead]] groups [http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/27/government-foils-skinhead-plot-assassinate-obama/ like this].

'''That other region''':
We don't talk about that, as this region is often difficult to explain as no sane man has ever dare set foot in this area. All records were lost once the initial inhabitants discovered crystal meth.

== Climate ==

The Climate of Tennessee is best described as ''fucking retarded''. The average temperature range of this cesspool is between 100-2500F with an average humidity of [[over 9000]] in the summer and ''Absolute fucking 0'' in the winter. Mountainous and woody regions are prone to exhibit low visibility due to large amounts of [[marijuana]] smoke and methamphetamine production.  Not that you will pay attention to the weather because you will be more concerned with avoiding inbred fuckfests which consist of muddy and oily [[sex]] with close family members and/or farm animals.

== Demographics ==

People from Tennessee are easily [[stereotype|described and classified into 4 distinct categories]].

1. Hick: Typical pro-life, wife beater, [[murderer|gun-nut]], NASCAR fan, moonshine/meth maker, and [[Notfourchan]] member. Men with beards to their knees, [[fatass|Guts that extend for miles]] (which lead to them not having seen their penis in years), and a stench that could strip the paint off a wall. A good example is [[Conservapedia]] sysop Brian MacDonald (aka Karajou). On the other hand, the [[women]] have black eyes, often go barefoot and are pregnant of their grandfathers children.

2. Country Musician: Mullet and Guitar, typical talentless losers who barely qualify as musicians let alone people.

3. Plantation owners: Often seen in [[white]] suits mimicking [[KFC|Colonel Sanders]]. They tend to speak about [[shit nobody cares about|nothing]] in great detail and will question whether you're from outer space.

4. Niggers: (Note: Not actually people) These specimens aren't found anywhere else in the state with the exception of Memphis (excluding plantations). After the [[slavery|Great Tribal Move from Africa]] in the late 1700's, many niggers became lost on their way to the promised Land ([[Fresh Prince of Bel-Air|West Philadelphia]])and [[Detroit]]. A coin was flipped and the tribe decided to stay wherever their lips first drug the ground. Around 1810 the city was finally renamed Memphrica and it has all gone to hell.

== Politics ==
[[File:Basil_marceaux_twitter.png|thumb|250px|Basil Marceaux.com by [[cheating|any means necessary]].]]

Tennessee's favourite son, [[Al Gore]], was recently replaced in the hearts and minds of [[hicks|Tennesseans]] by the [[GOP]]'s great white hope [[Basil Marceaux.com]]. Like Gore, Mr. .com is also an [[environmentalist]] but believes that planting [[weed|grass]] will not only balance the state budget but make Tennessee energy self-sufficient and [[green]]. In addition using prison inmate [[slaves|chain gangs]] to do all the work will reduce chances of ex-cons becoming repeat offenders. Other than that, Mr .com has an [[batshit insane|innovative]] and daring platform.

*Basil Marceaux Dot Com is dedicated to the abolition of [[slavery]] (especially at STOP signs).
*Basil Marceaux Dot Com is dedicated to arming [[batshit insane|nutcases]] and convicted felons in accordance with the Second Amendment which Mr .com says states that we all have right -nay, obligation- to bear arms ''against'' our government.
*Basil Marceaux Dot Com will fine your arse $10 if you do not buy a handgun.
*Basil Marceaux Dot Com will remove all traffic stops in Tennessee (and crack down on any slavery at said locations).
*Basil Marceaux Dot Com will arrest the police.
*Basil Marceaux Dot Com will make Death Row murderers die the way they killed. Suffocate someone with a plastic bag? Death penalty = plastic bag.
*Basil Marceaux Dot Com will turn Tennessee into a Republic.
*Basil Marceaux Dot Com will pardon you for all [[bestiality|crimes in Tennessee]].
*Basil Marceaux Dot Com will establish a [[bribe|slush fund]] for criminals who help him plant [[weed|grass]] to balance the state budget. This despite the fact that there won't be anyone in jail.

[[tl;dr]]? If you like [[bedlam]], Basil Marceaux Dot Com is your man

== Tennessee Today ==
[[Image:Godihatetennessee.jpg|thumb|Seen in Tennessee.]]
Recently more and more people have started to believe in the existence of Tennessee. Also many of them still claim to believe in some form of [[God]]. [[Al Gore]] also claims to be from the mystery that is [[the internets|Tennessee]], but he has also made claim to creating the internet and Dig-Dug. On a sad note Nashville, a chemical storage facility in the middle of nowhere, is still producing inbred musicians who chant on and on about sister fucking, old cars, or how their tractors had exploded and then rolled down the hill. Also, for some reason even though being in the 21st century, [[at least 100 years ago|at least 100%]] of Tennessee doesn't have access to internet speeds over 4kb/s.

The state shows no signs of improving.  This probably has something to do with the fact that the State Department of Education spends less on students than any other state.  Yes, even [[New Jersey|New Jersey]].  Due to this fact, if you ever see anyone from this [[Goatse|shithole]] of a state, be sure to speak slowly and in simple phrases.  Never look them in the eye.  They will see this as a threat and kill you, after [[rape|raping]] you in the [[ass|butt]] of course.  The best solution [[science|scientists]] have come up with would be for the [[government|Government]] to [[World War II|pull a Hiroshima]] and [[Holocaust|eradicate]] the fuckers.

== Anything good? ==

The only good thing to be said about the state is that it was home to Elvis and Johnny Cash, even though they both moved there rather than being born there. However, recently, it was discovered that there are a few ED users in this tragic cesspool, whom hope to someday eliminate all the bad and turn it into an internet utopia. These users DO have internet speeds in excess of 4kb/s, some even reaching the level of 55kb/s, which gave them a free ticket to their Uncle's bedroom with jug of moonshine and their sister.

In other words, no.
