Undesirable Number One

{{potential}}

Undesirable Number One was once the highest posted upon [[Harry Potter]] forum on [[FanFiction.Net]], a position now claimed by [http://www.fanfiction.net/forum/The_Reviews_Lounge/29938/ The Reviews Lounge] since Undesirable Number One vanished in either December 2007 or January 2008. Nobody who cares remembers. Nobody who remembers cares. 

It had 21 subscribers and four Moderators (one of whom who was constantly MIA), and [[over_9000|over 22,000 posts]]. It recently had its second birthday, which fell on December 23, 2007. It was started by [http://www.fanfiction.net/~mrsclairepotter Mrs Claire Potter] and named by [http://www.fanfiction.net/~heavensflyingfish/ Heaven's Flying Fish] when she won the 'Name the Forum Competition', held some time ago.  

This "[[COCK|web site thread]]" was so awesome it was closed down by the Australian House of Representatives backbenchers, namely Peter "the whore" Costello. A reliable source says that he hacked into Mrs Claire Potter's FanFiction.Net account after one too many late nights with John "the sex" Howard.

[[Communism|Administrator]]: Mrs Claire Potter<br>
Moderator 1: [[Geek|Heaven's Flying Fish]]<br>

== Mrs Claire Potter ==
'''Administrator''': [http://www.fanfiction.net/u/909260/ Mrs Claire Potter] is a ruthless and witty Australian man of 40 years of age, according to fellow Moderator and friend, [http://www.fanfiction.net/~heavensflyingfish].

[[Image:Mrs_Claire_Potter.jpg|thumb|200 px|An alleged photo of Mrs Claire Potter.]]

However, according to her FanFiction.Net profile, she is a 15 year old girl. She set up the forum in an effort to best her friend [http://www.fanfiction.net/~Googlesnook Google Snook's] forum, The Rotfag Conspiracy, which has since been deleted.

She has written a number of [[Harry Potter]] [[fan fiction|fanfictions]], and a number of fanfictions which have been deleted. Her main genre is [[parody]]. 

Mrs Claire Potter started her account at FanFiction.Net at "the tender age of twelve", a few months after [http://www.fanfiction.net/~heavensflyingfish]. She decided on her name out of a twelve-year-old crush on Harry Potter's father, James Potter. According to some statements she has made, the name "Claire Potter" was already taken by another user, thus forcing her to add a "Mrs" to her name.

Recently, Mrs Claire Potter made her debut on stage in a school production of Peter Pan, in which she played [[Prostitute|Wendy Darling]].

Mrs Claire Potter's [[shit|favourite]] Harry Potter characters are the following, in no particular order:

[[shit_nobody_cares_about|Harry Potter

<br>Rubeus Hagrid<br>

Lucius Malfoy<br>

Fred & George Weasley<br>

Draco Malfoy<br>

Dean Thomas<br>

Lord Voldemort<br>

James Potter<br>

Severus Snape<br>

Barty Crouch Junior<br>

Cedric Diggory<br>

== Heaven's Flying Fish ==
'''[[Moderator]]:''' Heaven's Flying Fish is an [[fail|equally witty]] [[Australia]]n girl of [[16_year_old_girl|15 years of age]]. 

[[Image:Fish.jpg|thumb|200 px|<I>Self portrait</I>, by Heaven's Flying Fish.]]

Heaven's Flying Fish was voted the 'Most Nastiest Moderator', between herself, Mrs Claire Potter, and Mint Humbug. 

== "The Others" ==
'''Moderator:''' Mint Humbug. Real name Phoebe. Fifteen years old; Australian. If you are ever on line when she is posting, consider yourself blessed. Hardly ever seen. Played 'John' in the same school production of [[Peter Pan]] as Mrs Claire Potter.

'''Moderator:''' [http://www.fanfiction.net/~seriouslykelsey seriously kelsey], aka Kelsey, is the most recent addition to the Moderation team. Unlike the other three, she (also fifteen) is from America, and may be the only American Mrs Claire Potter and Heaven's Flying Fish can stand. The two prominent moderators took a shine to her immediately, and she didn't suffer under the barrage of insults that usually assaults [[fag|newbies]].

== [[nazi|World Domination]] ==

Taken from the 'World Domination' thread:

"Here at 'Undesirable Number One' we have decided to do a spot of friendly WORLD DOMINATION.

[[chain_letter|#9. Create a chain email saying that if the person doesn't go onto this forum and doesn't send the email to all their contacts, then a child ghost with white skin, red eyes and no mouth will come and murder them.]]"

== Prominent Discussion Topics ==
Generally, the hormonal [[Teenager|teens]] on this forum cover a range of pointless shit in their endless and often bitchy conversations, most which indicate that they have nothing better to do than post crap about [[Nothing|nothing]].

== Former Moderators and Members ==
'''Moderator:''' [http://www.fanfiction.net/~cosmicchaos Cosmic Chaos], a thirteen year old girl from Trinidad and Tobago was briefly a Moderator, assigned the job of fixing the spelling and grammar in member BoozeHound's posts. Mrs Claire Potter revoked the title soon after giving it, as Cosmic Chaos did not do her job properly. Is still a poster on the forum.

'''Moderator:''' [http://www.fanfiction.net/~nerocosine Nero Cosine], (ageless) Sydney-sider was immediately liked by Mrs Claire Potter, and duly added to the moderation team. However, the title was revoked some time later, as she never actually posted on the forum and hasn't been seen for months.


'''Past Prominent Members''': 

''Canon is dead long live fanfic'': [[Disney|Sebastian]] was a long standing [[member]] of the forum. In his early twenties (assumed) and from Bristol, Canon was accused of being in love with Heaven's Flying Fish after he asked if he could "keep" her. Mrs Claire Potter made the accusations. It seems as if he has gotten a [[life]] since then, and has not been seen.

''UnexplainableFear'': A boy of [[londonistan|Middle Eastern descent who lived in England.]] Wanted to be a [[psychologist]]. Has since gotten a [[IRL|life]]. Was assumed to be female by the forum population, which turns out to be false. The truth is that he is a tranvestite from the furture whos penis grows bigger and vagina gets tighter when ever he/she discoveres a deep secert of its patients durring routine apointments with its clients.

''flowers of ice'': An original poster. Lived in Singapore and took a number of [[drug|advanced classes.]]

''BoozeHound'': A foul-mouthed, grammatically incorrect Brit in her late teens. Both Mrs Claire Potter and Heaven's Flying Fish attempted to [[Polish|polish]] her vulgar personality. Both failed.


'''Resident [[Paedophile]]''':

Becca1717, aka Valentine Wiggin, who is assumed to be a [[Paris Hilton|fifty year old American man]] attempting to [[wank|pass off]] as a sixteen year old Australian girl who longed for an incestuous relationship with her cousin. Started a second account to start [[fruit|afresh]], but plans were foiled. Immediately.

It is possible that Becca1717 is actually [[Snapesnogger]] due to their similar discussion topics and conversational tone. And also the fact that they are both like herpes: repulsive, itchy, and continually returning.

It is imperative to note that neither Becca1717 nor Valentine Wiggin has returned to the forum since his secret has been revealed on this website.
