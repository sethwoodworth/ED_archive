Internet celebrity
[[Image:Magibon02.jpg|thumb|right|Magibon, Internet celebrity ''par excellence'']][[Image:102.jpg|thumb|right|iJustine, immensely popular [[YouTube]] user]]An '''Internet celebrity''' is an [[unemployed]] person worshipped by 12 year old kids who is widely known among the members of an e-[[:category:subcultures|subculture]] or [[:category:cliques|clique]]. The term itself is a [[lie|misnomer]] because people who use the internet are not popular [[IRL]]. Most Internet celebrities have more [[friends]] on their [[LiveJournal]] [[friends list]] than anyone else, and it is to these vaunted heights of e-fame that all self-respecting [[Attention Whore|attention]] or [[comment whore]]s aspire. 

Internet celebrities think that they are funny, witty and [[e-popular]], but in truth  most people just want to [[fuck|sleep with]] them, which is especially the case with [[e-celebrity]] [[Chris-chan]]. Some Internet celebrities mistake themselves for actual celebrities, but it is important to remember that even such individuals as [[Cory Doctorow]] are only known within a very small circle of [[Internets]]-savvy people. Get over yourselves. [[Kibo]] was one of the first Internet celebrities.

[[Andy Milonakis]] started out like that, but once everyone found out he was some freak adult they realized his show was based on [[faggotry]].

So pretty much, internet celebrities are [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] losers who, IRL, never have and never will do anything real with their lives. 

===E-Fame===

If you can't get famous [[IRL|in real life]], your only alternative is to be an [[attention whore]] engaging in [[shameless self promotion]] until you achieve the fine heights of e-fame, a celebrity in the electronic alternative reality that is [[teh]] [[internets]].

Marks of e-fame include having more people on your [[LiveJournal]] [[Friendslist]] than anyone else, having your posts featured on [[LJ Drama]], and of course having your own entry on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. Also, [[Chris Crocker|crying over Britney is highly recommended]]. Failing even that, championing the cause of the [[Furluminati]] is another way to raise your e-fame to [[OVER 9000]].

If none of the above work, then obviously the only things you are good for are spreading the diseases of both [[AIDS]] and epic [[fail|phail]]

==How to Become an Internet Celebrity==

* Make a video [[BAWW|BAAAWWWWW-ing]] about your favorite [[IRL]] celebrity.
* Pretend to be an intellectual by posting [[bullshit|controversial]] videos on YouTube.
* [[Sparkling wiggles|Find a young child with a speech impediment]]
* Draw popular [[anime]] characters having [[bestiality|animal]] [[buttsecks]]
* [[IDIFTL|Do it for the lulz]]

===How to Maintain E-Fame: [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|Doing it Wrong]]===

[[Image:Dorian-thorn-epic-fail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dorian Thorn]] enjoying his e-fame LOL.]]



Because there are so many [[CP|naughties]] and so much [[lulz]]-worthy [[shit]] clogging up the internets like cholesterol surging through an [[American]]'s arteries, it's hard to maintain the [[intellectual checkmate|open-mindedness]] and "uniqueness" that made them celebrities in the first place:

* Declare war on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].
* File a [[lawlsuit]] against all the haters.
* [[Final solution|Leave the internet forever]] . . . again and again and again and again.
* Make half a dozen different accounts. Note: these aren't [[sockpuppets]]. Sockpuppets are made so no one knows who you are. These accounts are made to escape the haters but they cannot resist the e-fame for long).
* [[Dorian Thorn|Post all your embarassing nudes to an LJ group then get butthurt when you end up on ED]].

===How to Maintain E-Fame: [[PROFIT|FUCKING WIN]]===

==Internet Celebrities - MYSPACE EDITION==
[[Image:JStarFailz.jpg|thumb|right|Looks [[pro-ana]].]]

A '''MySpace Celebrity''' is anyone who is [[attention whore|well-known]] on [[MySpace]]. Normally but not always, these [[basement-dweller|people]] have [[buttsecks|done something amazing]] to warrant their [[e-fame]]. Many are [[friendwhore]]s, and the rest are just regular [[whore]]s.

Some go on to exciting carriers as singers, actors and goatse body doubles.  Others just fade out in time and are replaced by the next [[loli|barely legal]] [[whore|tart]] that figures out how to use a key board.

MySpace Celebrities can be [[divide by zero|divided]] into [[at least 100|three]] categories.  They are:

===The [[A Plus|A]]-List===
[[Image:Tom-leer.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Tom has a [[pedo]]-smile.]]

*'''[[Tom Anderson]]'''. This [[bisexual]] [[pedophile]] is on every [[16-year-old girl]]'s [[friendlist]], and is often known to [[fap]] [[face-painter|on their pics]]. Tom has [[None|millions]] of friends. Known to try to coerce [[Azn]]s for [[sex]], Anderson has gotten quite a reputation as a [[sick fuck|player]], and is using his MySpace fame to get even [[moar]] sex. Most people are too [[stupid]] to understand that Tom is just a [[dong|publicity figure]] for MySpace who actually does nothing for the site.

*'''[[Tila Tequila]]'''. This [[azn]] [[whore]] has the 2nd-most friends of anybody on MySpace. However, she only got these friends by showing [[pussy|pink]] and [[fuck]]ing half the [[internets]]. Her [[TV]] show [[fail]]ed it, as did her attempt at making music. The majority of her [[interwebs]] time is spent being a [[camwhore]] for her [[sick fuck|adoring fans]].

*'''[[Jeffree Star]]'''. A [[faggot]] [[tranny]] who claims it has no gender, Star is the most popular [[gay]] figure on MySpace. Sometimes but not always [[wapanese]], Star's hobbies include being a [[camwhore]] and engaging in [[buttsecks]] with his [[fag|friends]]. [[Some argue]] that Star's [[penis]] has been removed.

[[Image:Shes_a_human.jpg|thumb|right|BAWWWWWWWWWW]]
*'''[[Chris Crocker]]'''. Another [[faggot]] [[tranny]], but this one's even [[moar]] [[batshit insane]]. After saying that [[JEWS DID WTC|9/11 was insignificant]] compared to the [[emo|agony]] [[Britney Spears]] was going through and openly admitting to [[gay]] [[incest]], Crocker's 15 minutes of fame seemed to be coming to an end. However, he still has [[over 9000]] MySpace friends and continues to rant and whine about [[breeder]]s, the word black person, and all sorts of [[faggot]]ry. Chris Crocker is a prime example of someone whose [[Guess the Gender|real gender is difficult to discern]]. Good luck trying.

*{{myspace|1001|Metal Sanaz}}. An [[atheist]] whore who listens to shitty pop-[[metal]] and claims she's [[hardcore]]. The only reason she's a MySpace celebrity is because she's [[fuck]]ing MySpace's head [[asspie|programmer]]. With her newfound [[e-fame]], Sanaz has decided to fail it through [[shameless self promotion]], i.e. "BUY MY POSTERS!!!![[oneoneone|1111111]]" If you are in a [[shitty band]] and want to become a [[sellout|rockstar]], contact Sanaz.

[[Image:Gay_god.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[mudkips|So i herd]] Gaygod lieks [[fellatio|to suck on things]][[?]]]]
*'''[[Gaygod]]''', aka Matthew Lush. A [[vegan]] [[emo]] [[faggot]] [[camwhore]] who spends all his time engaging in [[buttsecks]] for the sake of [[shameless self promotion]]. Though very [[poor]], Gaygod is able to stay alive through the support of the [[fag enabler]]s on MySpace. Frequently [[troll]]ed, Gaygod knows his [[batshit insane|views]] are not always [[contrary to popular belief|going to be popular]]. However, he continues polluting the internets with his [[faggotry]].

* {{myspace|ducc|Ducky}}. An [[azn]] who was the second person to sign up on MySpace. That is the only reason anybody gives a flying fuck about him.

===The B-List===

[[Image:PUNCH_HER_PETA.jpg|100px|thumb|left|[[Delicious cake|It is delicious face. You must punch it.]]]]

[[Image:Justlikeeveryoneesle_RRS.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Rational Responders are whores!!!1]]

*'''[[Rational Response Squad]]'''. These [[butthurt]] [[atheist]]s are on a mission to prove [[retard|there is no God]]. However, since they are all a bunch of [[whore]]s with [[Asperger's syndrome]], they have only gotten a small degree of [[internets]] fame by acting all [[hardcore]] about their beliefs. Comprised of [[cock|a few main members]], the Rational Response Squad is trying to unite all internet atheists. However, all they've really done is [[lol-cow|unite the ENTIRE FUCKING WORLD in mocking them]].

*'''[[PETA]]''', AKA the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comprised of [[angst]]y [[emo]] [[faggot]]s, these [[vegan]]s care [[moar]] about animal [[welfare]] than humanity. However, none of them are actually vegan because they all eat [[cock]] and drink [[cum]]. Every shitty emo band in existence supports these [[batshit insane]] [[fucktard]]s. However, most will become [[an hero]]es.
** {{myspace|peta2|On MySpace}}

*{{myspace|audreykitching|Audrey Kitching}}. A [[scene]] [[slut|model]] and [[loser|fashion designer]] who is a friend of [[Jeffree Star]]. Known to fuck every [[shemale]] she can get her hands on, Audrey is not only [[asking for it]], she is looking for it as well. Her claim to [[e-fame]] is having [[EXTREME ADVERTISING|EXTREMELY WILD AND FUCKING CRAZYSHIT HAIR]] and having [[sex|connections]] with most other MySpace celebrities.

=== The C-List ===
[[Image:Mmsdefault.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Mission: MySpace's default pic. It nevar changes.]]

* {{myspace|burntpickle|LoLo}}, a [[prison rape|convicted felon]] whose real name is Loren Williams. He runs a [[porn]] site and a few other [[NSFW]] sites. In his spare time, he serves as a minor [[internet humanitarian]]. However, he often insults MySpace, and that has resulted in his profile getting [[baleeted]] [[at least 100|multiple]] times. He was e-dating [[Jude's Army]] until he found out that Jude's Army was a fraud. He has now accepted the fact that he will be [[dying alone]].

* {{myspace|petraluna|Petra Luna}}, a [[Mexican]] singer who endured [[domestic violence]]. Now [[butthurt]], she [[fundie|preaches]] and speaks out against all forms of [[troll|abuse]]. A known supporter of [[PETA]], [[some argue]] that Loony is into [[bestiality]] or may be a closet [[furry]].

[[Image:Dh02.jpg|thumb|100px|right|The [[Vampire]] Don]]
*'''[[Don Henrie]]'''.  Believes he is a [[vampire]].  He actually drinks [[blood]] and sleeps in a coffin.  He has a [[dead|budding]] modeling career and is a hit with [[gothy]] [[16 year old girls]] and [[basement dwellers]] alike.

[[Image:Elzaeckzentrik_prom.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Elza=stuck up narcissist scenewhore.]]
* {{myspace|cute_zombie_girl|Elza Eckzentrik}}, Actually believes she has reached fame on [[myspace]] and buzznet,whereas lies the sad truth of her "Oh so drastic and stressful photoshoot" days.She is the stereotipical self absorbed moody pre-menstrual 14 year old [[teenager]],who thinks that only because she is a [[pro ana]] [[model]] will reach fame.She is way too good at selfpromotion.

*'''[[Mission: MySpace]]'''. The epitome of [[internet humanitarian]]ism. This [[faggot]] [[lurk]]s on MySpace to [[murder]] profiles of [[you|anyone he does not liek]]. He had connections to [[Jude's Army]] and the related [[drama]], but now spends his time hunting [[face-painter]]s, [[pedophile]]s, [[troll]]s, and other sorts of [[sick fuck]]s. He [[fail]]s it.

* {{myspace|littledana|Dana DeArmond}}. A [[porn]] star who claimed to be the [[internet]]'s girlfriend. Even after almost getting [[baleeted]], she continues her whorish ways.

* '''[[Cody Kardashian]]'''. The attention whoring brother of [[Kim Kardashian]].
* '''{{myspace|omgitsthatgirlfrommyspace|'''Miss Kristin Nicole'''}}'''. 21 year old [[straight edge]] (hence the discovery of [[Photoshopped]] pictures of her sucking her boyfriend's [[dick]]) [[scene]] [[drama]] queen with an entry-level DSLR camera and [[Photoshop]] who runs a photography "business." She is most notable for posting bulletins every 15 minutes along the lines of "My boyfriend's band is practicing and I am watching Lifetime, I'm deleting my profile, I'm [[pregnant]], comment me cute kids" and also making pointless YouTube videos that nobody watches about her past [[eating disorder]]s which caused her "[[disease]]" (which is really [[Jewish|Crohn's]]), her obsession with [[Twilight]], "advise" (sic) regarding breakups and how she dyes her hair every week. If you want to waste minutes of your life, her videos can be found {{youtube2|MissMKN|here.}}

* {{myspace|shanbamm|Chloe COW-lishaw}}. YouTube [[whore]] turned MySpace-lover. Famous for being Chris Crocker's {{youtube|1yCZCilZcR0|number 1 fan}} and for looking like a cow. Her pictures are often lulz-worthy as she obviously Photoshops her legs rather than [[man the harpoons]].

* {{myspace|geo_rocks|Geo Partcher}}. A photographer who thinks he is the [[internet]]'s most[[famous]] photographer and claims to own Famous-Partcher.

* '''[[Doe Deere]]'''. A typical narcissistic whore who does anything for attention. She once recorded some [http://www.myspace.com/doedeere/ horrible music] and posted it on myspace, hoping to become famous. Because having shit pumped through your ears with a fire hose is more pleasant than listening to her music, Doe Deere's career as a musician [[fail|never took off]]. Nowadays, she resorts to scamming [[16 year old girls]] by selling shitty [http://www.myspace.com/limecrimemakeup/ makeup].

=== The [[Fail|F]] List ===

*'''[[You]].''' Admit it... you have one.

=== Anonymous Celebrities ===
There are mysterious figures on the Internet who are famous for their efforts to make the internets a better place. These people are not-to-be-known gentlemen who rip, encode, compress, seed, draw cool reaction pics, edit [[Wikipedia|TOW]] gratuitously, write good articles about vintage games, dump ROMs, etc etc. Despite being famous, they aren't attention whores hence not appreciated by people.  

=== How [[anonymous|You]] Can Help ===

If [[you]] [[lurk moar|find]] any [[moar]] MySpace celebrities that belong on here, add them. [[DO IT FAGGOT]].
