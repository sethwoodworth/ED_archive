Kodomo no Jikan
{{Moar|lulz}}{{Needsnomore|lolicon}}
'''''Kodomo no Jikan''''' (translation: "[[Teenager#Puberty|A Child's Time]]") is a spank-fest followed religiously by the likes of [[pedophile|respectable gentlemen]] who lurk [[notfourchan]] and [[renchan]], parading itself around as a proper [[Animu|anime and manga]] series.

==Controversy and History==
This [[manga]] was originally scheduled for release under the title '''''Nymphet''''' in 2007. Somehow this title didn't raise concerns immediately for American censors. Not until later, after some people realized it was a romance story between a '''twenty-three year-old teacher''' and a '''nine year-old girl'''. The author, Kaworu Watashita states that the only problem is "differences in culture between the two countries" and called it "unfortunate." After all the bookstores dropped the title in an epic trolling, the publisher dropped the series. The [[lulz]] really started when [[faggots|bloggers]] in the U.S.A. started BAAAAAAAWing over it and citing the first amendment. Troll by telling them it has nothing to do with the government and Japan hates them anyways.

==Plot==
It revolves around the aforementioned teacher and student but also has major parts from several other characters. These characters add [[unfunny|humor]] by kicking the teacher in the balls while calling him a lolicon. The other half is "fanservice," serving as fap-bait for any pedophiles. Another staple of the series are double entendres that are generally really corny and unlikeable. Other than that it's '''TROO LOEV 4EVER''' and getting raped by her creepy uncle.

==Characters==
===Little Girl Rape Squad===
*'''Kokonoe Rin''': Perverted blonde pigtailed leader of the group who is constantly [[whore|whoring]] herself out to the teacher because she wants some [[harbl]]. She is a whiny bitch who went all [[emo]] after her mom got [[AIDS]] and died. Her [[lesbian]] friend made her all better though.
*'''Kagami Kuro''': She is called "Kuro-chan" which means "black" because she is cool and [[goth]] and stuff. Although her name is "Black" she is not a black person. They scare [[Japan|Japs]]. Anyways, she always wears slutty cosplay outfits like full [[catgirl]] attire, or [[EGL]]. She is a [[faggot]] obsessed with Rin and wants to [[rape]] her but also has an eye for their Vice Principal. She has an extensive knowledge of sex and fetishes which is to be expected of Japanese women.
*'''Usa Mimi''': The clumsy secretly-intelligent glasses-wearing ditz. She has '''MASSIVE''' [[tits]]. In fact, one episode revolves around this fact where she does boring shit like shop for a bra and gets embarrassed and cries. She BAAAAAWs at the slighted provocation. She is wildly in love with the rapist. She wears glasses which is apparently a fetish for Japanese people, but more because she is TTLY SMART. The last teacher yelled at her for being a crybaby bitch so she left. The new teacher is a [[I LIEK MILK|COOL DUDE, MAN]] and got her to come back. She is ignorant of all things sexual. In season 2, pretends to be Rin's dead mother and allows her to suckle her nipples (srsly).

===Teachers===
*'''Daisuke Aoki''': Or, "Aoki-sensei," as he is called in [[moonspeak]]. He is a moralfag who will not stick it in Rin's pooper no matter how much she asks. He is a pathetic [[you|virgin]] who freaks out at the slightest mention of sex. He is rather boring besides the fact he is constantly harassed by [[loli]]s. Every once in a while he has [[epic]] battles with the [[rapist]]. Lusts for Houin but puts date on hold to save loli in distress.
*'''Kyouko Houin''': Or, "Bouin-sensei," the onomatopoeia ("boing") for massive tits in Japan. Just in case you didn't catch that, she is stacked. This is a significant problem for her as she gets groped by her students. She is wildly in love with Aoki, but he turns her down because he loves the [[loli]]. She has a cosplay fetish and gets jealous of Shiro-chan.
*'''Shirai Sae''': Some old hardass bitch who yells at everyone to work harder. Noone liked her in high school cause she wouldn't put out. Is idolized by Kuro who nicknames her "Shiro-chan" (white). In the season 2 special, Shiro fantasizes about her teenage self having a lesbian relationship with a teenage Kuro.
*'''Oyajima Kenta''': Some [[pretty cool guy|pretty chill guy]] who looks like [[Brock]]. The best character by far.
*'''Nakamura-sensei''': Some [[pussy]] who got sick when team loli raped him for being an asshole to Mimi. He quit.

===Rapists===
*'''Kokonoe Reiji''': [[Josef Fritzl]] in training. [[Rape]]s Rin because her mom is dead. His parents died after they abused him for teh [[lulz]]. Vulnerable to safety scissors.

===Cancer Patients===
*'''Kokonoe Aki''': Rin's mom who dies. Has [[incest]]/[[buttsecks]] with Reiji.

===Stuffed animals===
*[[Pedobear]]: he's yellow but it's him.

|Ooh, some rare Kuro-service...|Anonymous|Need for parental acceptance? 

For some reason I look at this, though, and think of how all women feel like a little girl around a man they like (at some point or another). I can't tell you how many couples I see and the girl reverts to a little kid when with her man. It's just that overall vulnerability with someone.
