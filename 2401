My rants about school and the education system. 

{{frame|I always hated going to school mainly because of how tyranical and down right the teachers were. We also hated the way some of them acted.

School basically is PRISON for children, I mean those poor children have to endure class after class of horrible torturous lessons. The worse has to be PE class, it's like Survivor except much scarier. Then again there is Jump Jam which IS torture, they make the kids dance to some hideously out-dated pop music and copy the dance moves of their so called "leader". The instructor/leader mr Scott Irvine must be pure evil.

It seems to me that a certain witch-like school prinicpal whose name is Hitchpzup Srm spelt backwards is trying a little bit too hard...she made up all those bogus rules and makes the students follow them, she's a real tyrant.

The only thing worse from Jump Jam are those ridiculous school productions they make the kids take part in- the drama teacher Carl is in fact the WORST producer me and my brother have ever had the misfortune of working with. He RUINED a perfectly good screenplay of ours- we wanted the play about Egypt to be an action adventure movie but then he had to ruin it by changing the screenplay and turning it into a stupid, sappy musical. Damm that Carl! Damm him to hell! We were absolutely horrified when we saw it on stage- it was absolutely horrendous.

Also, Mrs Heidi Courtsee was a total nutcase, she thought EVERYTHING we did was negative. She was ALWAYS complaining.  She should see a psycheratrist or maybe someone like Oprah or Dr Phil. I think that teachers are NOT human at all- I think they're aliens. The school prinicpal was obviously a witch and that teacher aid Carol Selling was obviously related to the Crypt Keeper because she looks just like him.

If I was in charge of the board of education I would ban the following things from school:



•Gym class/sports
•Jump jam
•Any and all Hannah Montana or High School Musical related products.
•School productions.
•Any and all Goosebumps books because quite frankly they scared the heck out of me as a kid.
•Nasty rotten punks like Sally Webster and her posse- oh wait, I'd have them put in jail.
•Homework
•Work experience

And I would have the gym torn down and replaced with a video game arcade or movie theatre, I would also give every classroom it's own set of robots to do all the work so the students wouldn't have to, also have school end at the much more earlier time of 2:pm, also have more interesting items on the cafeteria menu and that goes for lunch orders too, have music classess that are taught by ACTUAL musicians instead of wannabes like Hillz and Julie King, instead of cheap school productions with tacky costumes, bad acting and lousy screenplays- I'd have expensive but at the same time awesome big budget productions with professional actors, special effects technicians, scriptwriters, makeup artists and composers and have our uncle who is a famous producer to run it with us. }}
