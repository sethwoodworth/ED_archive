The origins of the phrase "'''there are no girls on the Internet'''" are lost in the sands of time. The saying was created [[at least 100 years ago]], meaning it probably came from [[usenet]] along with [[Porn|pornography]], [[Child Porn|child pornography]], [[Furry|furry pornography]], [[Rule 34]], [[Unix]], [[Fail|Linux]], [[DOS]], [[Windows]], [[Fail|Mac OS X]], [[Amiga|AmigaOS 4]], [[Korean]]s, [[Lowtax|Richard "Lowtax" Kynaka]], and the [[Internet]] itself. Fucking [[usenet]].

It is worth noting that when speaking of "girls on the Internet" one is speaking of actual Internet [[loser|users]] actually [[masturbation|tickling a keyboard]].  If you are speaking in terms of jpgs, gifs and videos, then [[porn|the internet is almost entirely girls]] with only a [[gay|few exceptions]].

==Popularity==

[[Image:Anonymiss.jpg]]

"There are no girls on the internet" first gained popularity among what indisputably is the majority internet user demographic, the chronically unfuckable (not to be confused with the chronic unemployable, who often score huge slutpoints).

The phrase was in reference to the dearth of women who would own up to their gender in such company. Unlike IRL, where a woman unfortunate enough to be in the same room is forced to bear the presence of, or even be subjected to interaction with social retards, on the internet a woman need only not reveal her gender.

Of course, the general lack of confirmed [[vagina]] owners leads to a disturbing phenomenon known as the Nerd Rush. As observing a Nerd Rush discourages an intelligent woman from revealing her gender, and as less women reveal themselves, the more intense each Nerd Rush becomes, and [[some argue]] that women will eventually be driven off the net in a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is of course [[bullshit]]; women are [[whores]], not [[Al Gore|Nobel Peace Prize laureates]]. As time goes by, there will forever be more and more attention-hungry sluts lacking the capacity to begin any sentence without saying "like, so" as a precursor.

==Nerd Rush==

''The Nerd Rush seems an odd term. Surely it is impossible, due to extremely poor physical condition for a [[nerd]] to rush anywhere?''

'''Correct.'''

However, Nerd Rushing requires [[Typing with one hand|only the use of a single hand]], a requirement most often met at its bare minimum. It is typically started when a new user makes an introduction post revealing right off the bat that she is, in fact, female. Thus begins the frenzy as the pack descends, demanding [[tits_or_leave|documented evidence and proof]].

NERD RUSH!

Naturally, this is reason enough for girls to pretend to be guys.  No one wants to deal with a bunch of [[horny]] nerds.

SOZ NO, WoW is for lame men like Exod.

But anyone with brains knows that only [[13 year old boys]] play WoW.  If you fall for one that tricks [[you]], post it on /b/ so we can give you [[bullshit|advice]].

==Spotting a girl on the Internets==
{{quote|[[TITS OR GTFO|Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.]]|Carl Sagan}}

An actual real internets girl will typically NOT engage in explicit description of her sexual organs or their current, past, or projected future engagements. For example, a real Internet girl might mention she is on her [[period]]. This is fine, well within realgurl guidelines and a clear warning to leave the immediate vicinity. However, she is unlikely to describe the vile seepages involved. Eg: "The crimson ichor of my wymenhood cycle is leaking from my puffy, raw [[vagina]] (that aches to be fucked)."

Don't fall for this shit and be fapping to a gay homo who has easily tricked you. Despite the delusions that many obese flabtards labor under the impression of, women are not a bizarre alien species but rather men with more interesting [[boobs|genitalia]]. As such, the sane versions do not have enough of a fixation with their own crotch equipment to write page upon page of interesting information concerning the [[clitoris]].

No matter how [[fat]], no matter how annoying, no matter how stupid, how slutty, how fucking shit-full a [[Girl Drama|girl on the internet]] is, there will be a tribe of [[virgin|White Knights]] to defend her from any real or perceived slight. This will in each and every way lead to drama, either through swarm attacks on any outsider who attempts to pop the female's ever-growing ego, or the never-ending infighting as the [[Nice guys|virgin tribe]] attempt to win e-favor with whatever blubbery cakemonster they've barnacle'd themselves onto.

The golden rule can at any time be [[i_did_it_for_the_lulz|ignored for lulz]]. Please also refer to [[girl on the internet syndrome]].
