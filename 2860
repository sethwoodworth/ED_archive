Fanfic lesbians
Unbeknownst to many, all [[fanfic]] authors and [[fans]] are [[lesbian]]s.  Even the men.

This is frequently confirmed by [[Suethors]], for whom "LESBIAN" (sometimes even "LESBAIN") is the insult of choice.

'''Purists''', a subtype of [[fanfic lesbians]], are people who follow a [[fandom]] obsessively and hate to see [[Mary Sue]]s, bad [[AU]], and deviations from [[canon]].
