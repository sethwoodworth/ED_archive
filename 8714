'''User-generated content''', not to be confused with [[original content]], is a defining feature of [[Web 2.0]] that allows big corporations to make [[money]] without even having to make any [[work|effort to do so]], because ordinary people do it for them. Typically, the website hosting user-generated content will lure new users in who contribute their content, without any pay, and then the user gets fucked over by [[The Man]]. There are many types of user-generated content, ranging from poor quality [[Wikipedia|academic reference work]] to poor quality [[swingers|porn]]. Although these may not seem like they have much in common, the one thing they do share is that they are being used by corporations to make money out of the work of [[retard|idiots]].

==Sites that have UGC==
Most Web 2.0 sites have user-generated content. This includes [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], [[Wikipedia]], [[YouTube]] and porn sites such as Megarotic Video, [[YouPorn]] and Pornotube. News websites, personal websites, search engines and even social networking sites are not [[some argue|traditionally included]] within the realm of UGC. This is because personal Web 1.0 websites are controlled by the owner of the site, and the "content" generated by social networking websites is so [[shit]] that nobody on the rest of the internet, other than [[pedophile]]s, is interested in it.

==How it works==
You get an [[deep thinker|academic]], an aspiring film maker, or a [[pervert]], and you sign them up to the relevant UGC service. With UGC, the users [[cocksucking|surrender]] all copyright to the content, which means that not only can anyone on the site use the content, the site can [[win|make money from it by spreading it elsewhere on the internet]]. In the case of the perverts making [[amateur porn]], they can be further [[pwnt]] by the site by the potential for their family, friends or employer finding out about it, treating the user with no mercy, with the [[porn]] in the public domain for an infinite amount of time, possibly long after their [[death]], centuries from now, if the [[internets]] is [[2012|still around]]. You can [[epic]]ally pwn a [[woman]] by including a hidden camera taking video in your bedroom whilst you're having [[secks]] and put it on one of these sites.

With [[Wikipedia]], everyone who contributes UGC there gets nothing, and loses a lot, whilst the organisation itself benefits. This is rather similar to [[Scientology]], and meets all the criteria for [http://www.rickross.com/warningsigns.html being a cult]!!! This is a clear sign that providing user-generated content, unless submitted for the [[lulz]] and for the lulz only, is akin to [[asking for it|asking]] to be [[rape]]d in the ass and contracting [[AIDS]] without getting paid for it. Also those who provide user-generated content may also face legal threats for it, whilst the website it is submitted to may not, resulting in epic pwnage of retarded innocent newfag internet users.

==How to stop it==

*Not visiting UGC sites
*Scribbling in your [[SuperMemo]] instead of others' computers.
*Deleting [[system32]].

The options are somewhat restricted. It looks like UGC is here for good. However, this was recently challenged by [[Virgin]], for moar information see the [[Virgins vs Virgin]] page.
