'''Intelligence''' is an [[IRL]] power/strength or whatever you [[MMORPG]]fags refer to it as like [[porn|good looks]], rich parents, artistic talents, manipulation skills, [[sports|physical stamina]], and willingness to be a doormat. It classifies people into their place in society; [[nerd|nerds, scientists, academics,]] and [[Basement-dweller]]s. Whereas the others' main ability is to squeeze out babies, the intelligent should feel blessed: they get to do ALL of the work and let the dumbshit human race take credit for all of their advancements.

The concept of intelligence relies on being able to feel superior to the person next to you by knowing more than they do. Usually it's because your rich parents could afford to send you to a school that teaches [[shit nobody cares about|Latin & Classical Studies]] and then haul you off to some Ivy college full of fellow [[Jews]]. Other times it's from being able to [[hack]] and [[program]] like a pro but only after spending hours in your bedroom crying because the mean [[jock]]s beat you up and you're willing to wait 15 years just to fuck their hot girlfriend. Other times it's because one suffers from white guilt and somehow gets a superiority complex by dissing [[America]] and wanting to be [[European]] or [[Canadian]].

Some people think you can get really intelligent simply by rolling three sixes with a set of three six sided dice. However, contrary to popular [[opinion]] that this can be repeated for evar, as soon as you get any intelligence at all you realise how fucking stupid that idea was. You then go back to your starting point of Completely [[Fucktard]]ed and create a [[MySpace]].

==How to find intelligence==
For those seriously searching for intelligence in the universe, follow this simple plan:

*Stop looking in [[America]]. Just don't bother, it's been searched for [[Over 9000]] times.

*Code a LJ Intelligence Scanning Bot. Once you have found your intelligent victim, go and eat their brain. This will give you all their intelligence, but you will also [[shit bricks]].

*It is super sekrit knowledge that there are large deposits of intelligence ore underneath [[Atlantis]].

*All your intelligence are belong to [[The Man]]. [[Divide by zero]]!!, every The Man lives in America.

*If all else fails, lower your standards of intelligence. If it's just "reaction to stimulus" or something simple like that, a tadpole is pretty smart.

*Go to a [[Mensa]] meeting - everyone there has an [[I have a 140 IQ|IQ over 140]].

*Look anywhere on the [[internet]]. Everyone and their mother on the internet has an [[I have a 140 IQ|IQ of 140 or higher.]] If in doubt, your best bet is to look on sites such as [[Plenty of Fish]], [[Livejournal]], [[MySpace]], or [[Gaia]]. These sites are just teeming with intellect.

If all else fails, visit [[Facepunch studios]] and make everything you type grammatically correct. They believe that this is the sole indicator of intelligence.

==Human Intelligence==
So far, [[humans]] seem to be the only [[animals]] [[smart]] enough to build something as complex as a [[computer]], and [[stupid]] enough to waste it on [[shit]] like [[b|this]]. The top tier of humanity consists of [[nerds|scientists]] and academics who develop the world's [[internets|technology]] in hope that one day the Human race evolves into supreme beings only speculated of in sci-fi who have gained [[42|knowledge to solve the meaning and mystery of the universe]]. Instead, these poor perma[[virgins]] will be stripped of their life's work so people like [[Steve Jobs]] can exploit and market their inventions to the consumer market, thus advancing their status on the human tier of superiority while the nerds [[die alone]] playing [[WOW]]. Computers which were envisioned to connect the world, share [[piracy|information]], and do our work for us instead are used by [[16 year old girls]] to [[attention whore]] and dumb fucks who think their computers are STILL not big enough and their iPhones [[iPad|STILL NOT BIG ENOUGH]].

Taking a stroll around the internet, will display the tragedy that is "human intelligence". The most widely visited sites are for girls willingly posing like sex dolls in hopes of finding a boyfriend to gold dig off of, search engines so we don't have to go to the library, and a video site we use to watch cats farting instead of old classical movies that express the depth of emotions and beauty. People post on forums to gain status they can't earn [[IRL]] and [[leech]] advice because they're too lazy to [[Google]] that shit. The most googled questions are about getting laid and buying [[weed]].

Before you shoot yourself and become [[an hero]] upon realization of the existential despair and depression that forms from looking upon the cesspool of filth, remind yourself the true satisfying meaning of life: [[for the lulz]]

[[Nietzsche]] tells us to enjoy the [[sex|passions]] and find our [[Nazi|superman]] within. So therefore one should eat to live, rise above the standards and become one's ideal, precede the bang the shit out of your [[DO IT FAGGOT|boss's wife]], then buy [[over 9000]] [[jailbait]], have a [[orgy]], steal money from everyone, live to tell the story, and then write a novel about it similar to Marquis de Sade.

==[[Bullshit|"Multiple Intelligence" Bullshit]]==

"Multiple intelligence" is a concept coined by politically correct naive concerned adults (the same ones who buy into the [[new age]] and [[liberal]] bullcrap) to excuse why some people are [[idiot]]s. If someone scored a 90 on a IQ test, they aren't dumb (yes, they are) they just have a different type of intelligence than the stereotypical image.

It was originally conceived to help [[Big Brother|the system]] sort out what place everyone will be for the rest of their lives, but instead is used by politically correct upper middle class [[yuppies]] to masturbate about how liberated and intelligent they are for knowing so much about what their child likes to do in their free time.

Proper Usage: 
{{quote|Bob scored high on logical/mathematical intelligence and low on interpersonal. We recommend he become a [[engineer]] or [[basement dweller]]|Proper Usage}}

Improper Usage:
{{quote|[[unwarrented self importance|How dare you insult my decision to go art school and call me an idiot! I just have a high spatial intelligence, so excuse me for being irregular from your ignorant views!]]|Improper Usage}}

Dumbass Usage:
{{quote|tyrone aint no idiot he just got da highest on da kinetic intelligense wich mean he still smart but it dont matter i suppose|Dumbass Usage}}

The Intelligences:
*'''Spatial''': means you are good with visualizing and [[art]]. Great to have if you plan on drawing [[hentai]], [[furry]]porn, [[sparkledogs]], [[yaoi]], [[anime]], and going to [[art school]]
*'''Linguistic''': means you are good with expressing yourself with words. Great to have if you plan on [[cry moar|crying moar]] on [[livejournal]], being [[emo]] and writing [[poetry]] about [[love]], and [[fanfic]]s
*'''Logical Mathematical''': means you are good with logic and math (DUH). Great to have if you wish to become [[1337]] [[hacker|h4x0r]], permavirgin, or [[engineer]]
*'''Bodily-kinesthetic''': some lame ass excuse for [[sport]] loving meat heads to be counted as intelligent
*'''Musical''': 90% of your classmates will score this because they love to play shitty cover songs of [[Linkin Park]] and [[Nirvana]]
*'''Interpersonal''': good at [[attention whoring]]
*'''Intrapersonal''': good at [[BAWW]]WWWING
*'''Naturalistic''': [[beastiality]]

==Fallacies of the Intelligent==

People who are intelligent have a tendency to over-analyze things, meaning that they look for hidden meaning in things that are [[camwhore|shallow]], [[obvious]], and incredibly [[stupid]], when in reality there is none. The following are some examples taken from [[YouTube]]...

{{quote|this film is at its heart an exploration of both personal and cultural themes, exposing our exploitative relationship with our environment on a personal level and, by extension, as a society or species. The poo in this sense is a symbol of the by-products of our capitalist consumerism, with alan titchmarsh reflecting the role of the media; alerting us, ridiculing us, perhaps even judging us - the media becomes a collective conscience that binds us to our own environmental mortality. The refrain of titchmarsh is answered by our inability as a global society to take a truly global responsibilty; as we continue to poo at paul's we are nevertheless reminded that the poo is in fact very much situated in our own pants.|cyriak}}

{{quote|Yoshi is WalrusGuy, symbolizing his death.
We're all﻿ Link, causing his death.
Luigi is all our sadness at whoever closed his account.
The king is his account.
Gannon is the person who closed it.
Zelda is his YTP's.
Gwonam is when we found out about the closure.
The end scene with Zelda's grave is what Youtube will be like without WalrusGuy.
It sure will be boring without WalrusGuy...
And the Dr. rabbit scene is basically saying 'Get over it, smile and it will be better...|8BitWalugi}}
