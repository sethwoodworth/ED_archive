Internet Panhandling
'''Internet Panhandling''' is what happens when [[unwarranted self importance]] combines with [[shameless self promotion]] to lead a person to have [[unrealistic expectations]] about their ability to make [[IRL]] money on the [[internet]]. 

== Causes == 
It often starts with an [[attention whore]] and a [[blog]], although it often manifests itself in other forms. The [[attention whore]], sometimes with the aid of [[sockpuppets]] begins to create a following for themselves on whatever corner of [[Web 2.0]] they're in. This inevitably leads to [[unwarranted self importance]], as the [[attention whore]] believes that their own lives is of [[Serious Business|critical importance]] to others. Eventually, their [[attention whore|attention whoring]] consumes them and they spend all their time on the internet because they're usually a [[basement-dweller|basement-dwelling]] [[faggot]] anyway. Being [[unemployed]], they scheme to make their money off of their [[retard]] [[fanboys]] so that they don't have to get a real job and they can spend all their time [[OTI]]. Frequently, the [[attention whore]] will try to tie their begging to their actual purpose on the internet, and then progress to [[shameless self promotion|simply demanding money]] because [[unwarranted self importance|they need it]].

* [[YouTube]] - Internet Panhandling is especially prevalent on youtube as ordinary [[douchebag]]s become easily convinced that they can bridge the gap from [[Internet Celebrity]] to actual [[celebrity]]. As the [[honorz]] pile up and they gain in [[epic]] [[unwarranted self-importance]] they begin to believe that they have actual talent and that they should be [[bullshit|compensated for their services]]. Some of these [[fgt]]s will say that they are simply using youtube to make a name for themselves in a way [[The power of online communication|never before possible]]. But they are [[nevar]] talented enough to be actual celebrities and instead resort to begging for money on their channels. Eerily enough, some youtubers even believe this despite gaining many of their subscribers through spamming and using [[sockpuppets]]. 

* The [[Blogosphere]] - Since some big bloggers such as [[Andrew Sullivan]] and [[Michelle Malkin]] have made it into the mainstream media, any [[douchebag]] with an opinion now believes that they can do the same. With the advent of PayPal, it is simple to just stick a button on their page and wait for the expected donations to roll in. Political bloggers are particularly likely to tinge their begging with political rhetoric, as giving a donation is portrayed as part of the larger fight against the other guys. People who blog about their regular lives may gain followings and therefore [[unwarranted self importance]] over their newly found large [[e-penis|e-peen]]. These bloggers create their own cafepress stores and then may progress to more outright begging. However, this form of blogging is more insidious, because you're actually paying them for [[boring]] you. 
* [[Freenode]] - [[Rob Levin]] was a notorious [http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2006-June/047380.html beggar and fraud], well at least until he had his [[Car|date with destiny]].
