'''''The Colbert Report''''' is a half-hour documentary series on the successes of IRL trolling, as presented by the Master himself, The Rev. Sir Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A. Unlike it's predecessor, [[fail|The Daily Show]], the Colbert Report is made of pure, unadulterated, [[epic win|EPIC MOTHERFUCKING WIN]].

Colbert is [[B|/b/]] in [[NORP]]s' clothing. His on-camera persona is a cross between a [[Bill O'Reilly|pompous, neocon blowhard]] and an [[Glenn Beck|ignorant, racist libertarian]]. He is actually a [[liberal]] [[Catholic]] [[IRL|in real life]], so this is clearly a [[Shitty art|PoMo]] television persona heavily steeped in [[irony]].










==[[Win|The Report]] vs. [[Fail|Other Shows]]==

It differs from ''[[The Daily Show]]'' in that it doesn't so much [[unfunny|lampoon]] [[lulz|news and current events]], presenting its jokes as actual, relevant [[SFB|serious fucking business]] for [[old|mature]], [[Lemonparty|sophisticated]] [[Liberals]], as does Jew; rather, ''The Colbert Report'' takes the [[lulz|news]], [[molest]]s it, [[B|disfigures]] it, [[You_don%27t_have_any_friends|mocks]] it and [[Rape|fucks the shit out of it]] before sending it to [[B|/b/]] for [[bukkake|additional flavor]].

A more [[eurofag|cultured viewer]] may notice that The Colbert Report is like a better, funnier version of [[Chris Morris]]' "The Day Today" or "Brass Eye".

[[tl;dr]] he does it for the [[lulz]]. However, dimwitted [[Conservatives]] [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/27/colbert-study-conservativ_n_191899.html think otherwise.]

==[[DO NOT WANT|Pet Peeves]]==

[[Image:OnNotice.jpeg|thumb|300px|Colbert puts some [[Shit]] '''ON NOTICE!''']]

Colbert regularly campaigns against [[liberals]], who he regards as [[why do you hate America?|the cancer that is killing America]]. Other things that Colbert currently has [http://www.shipbrook.com/onnotice/ ON NOTICE!] include:

*[[Hilary Clinton|Distractions]]
*[[MILF|Jane Fonda (Fantasies)]]
*<strike>[[LHC|Black Hole at Center of Galaxy]]</strike> This would be your lucky day, if time existed inside you.
*[[bears|Grizzly Bears]]
*[[tree hugger|Journal of Paleolimnology]]
*<strike>[[Jews|Israeli Newspapers]]</strike> PARDONED

[[Shit nobody cares about|And amongst things currently dead to him are]]:

*[[WBM|Men with Beards]]
*[[O Rly|Owls]]
*[[engrish|CNN en Espanol]]
*[[fags|Cast of ''Friends'']]
*[[old people|The Elderly]]

==[[Win|What he likes]]==

But Colbert is no one-dimensional [[troll]] who hates everything; things he likes include
* [[TOW]], which he regards as being responsible for [[nice try|Wikiality]], and which he uses as his [[personal army]]
* [[Jesus|White Jesus]]
* [[Rush Limbaugh|Oxycodone]]
* The fine [[fucktards|people]] and [[Shit|products]] of Prescott Pharmaceuticals, including WikiNex, guaranteed to fix the [[Irony|anything they fucked up in the first place]] (side effects include [[Futurama|Wandering Bladder]], [[Shit|article editing]], and [[butthurt]]).

==Colbert Trolling==

===Trolling [[Billo The Clown]]===

Colbert has a [[trolling IRL|love/hate relationship]] with his [[butt buddy|mentor]] [[Papa Bear]] O'Reilly. In early [[2007]], Colbert once again whipped out his ground-dragging brass [[balls]] to take [[Billo The Clown]] to [[pwn|the mat]] on his own show after blowing him. After that, Colbert made O'Reilly lose [[The Game|The Game]] during the interview. He also [[lulz|stole Billo's microwave from the Fox hospitality room and still hasn't given it back]].

<youtube>s76LLK6ATkQ</youtube>

For his part, Papa Bear returned the favor and appeared on Colbert's show where he was promptly [[pwnt]] again. <strike>Google for the link cos [[Viacom]] are Nazis when it comes to Comedy Central clips on [[YouTube]].</strike> LOOP HOLE 
http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/81003/january-18-2007/bill-o-reilly

===Trolling Politicians===

He also frequently trolls [[attention whore|publicity-hungry]] politicians and the [[USA|Congressional Districts]] they represent when [[idiot|they agree to appear]] on the show's "Better Know A District" segment. However, in early 2007, after unprecedented amounts of [[butthurt]] and [[fail]] were experienced by the Democratic party, the head of their [[anti-lulz|national caucus]] issued a warning for [[pussies|Dems]] to steer clear of Colbert and his show. 

Almost immediately, [[Tennessee]] representative Steve Cohen ignored the advice and went on the show to be ræped by Colbert by asking him whether he's "the first Jew from Tennessee" and whether his claim that he has "the voting record of a black woman" means that he is, in fact, a [[sheneequa|black woman]].

One of his most [[epic win]]s in this department came when he persuaded [[New York]] Congressman Dan Maffei [[democrat|(D)]] to endorse [[Hookers and blow|cocaine and hookers]] [http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/224011/april-07-2009/better-know-a-district---new-york-s-25th---dan-maffei on camera] since he was running unopposed for re-election.
{{tinyquote|I enjoy [[cocaine]] because it's a fun thing to do.|Maffei}}
{{tinyquote|I enjoy the company of [[prostitute]]s because it's a fun thing to do.|Maffei}}
{{tinyquote|Wow. You realize there is no amount of damage control you can do at this point.|Colbert}}
{{tinyquote|That’s right.|Maffei}}
{{tinyquote|We’d better finish this interview quick, ‘cuz I’m not sure how long you’re going to be in Congress.|Colbert}}

===Giant [[Duke Nukem|Balls Of Steel]]===

But his finest moment in the [[IRL trolling]] department came at the 2006 Associated Press White House Correspondents Dinner, where he stood on the same podium as [[George Bush]], with about three people separating them, and [[IDIFTL|raped Bush]]. Here is the [[ruin]] in two parts.



<center>{{fv|colrep|background-color: #000000;|font-weight: bold; <youtube>qa-4E8ZDj9s</youtube>|<youtube>MOYZF3It848</youtube>|<youtube>iAvFM4TYQKU</youtube>}}</center>

Because of his status as the Master of Trolling, Colbert has often been said to have "balls of _______," where the blank is usually filled with an enormously hard or powerful substance, like steel or brass (or adamantium, diamonds, Zeus's lighting, etc). However, a recent investigation has revealed that his balls are actually composed of a metal commonly found at the core of white dwarf stars, a metal so incredibly dense it gives Colbert the ability to crush any given noun using the gravitational forces of his balls alone.

==[[Personal Army]]==

Colbert has a vast [[B|personal army]] of [[fanboi|fanbois and girls]] called [http://www.colbertnation.com/ '''The Colbert Nation''']. This loyal following is willing to do Stephen's [[buttsex|bidding]] [[sheeple|without question]]. For example, in January, 2007 Colbert was [[YHBT|disrespected]] by a Canadian Jr. League Hockey team, the Oshawa Generals, when their fans threw Teddy bears on the ice after beating his adopted team, the Saginaw Spirit, on home turf - General Motors Center. [[Waaaambulance|Feeling he was insulted]], he urged [http://www.colbertnation.com/ the Colbert Nation] to download GM's 150 page annual report [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16842683/ to throw on the ice during the rematch at Saginaw].

===The [[John McCain]] Greenscreen Challenge===

Republican presidential candidate [[John McCain]] is so [[boring|uninteresting]] to the [[American]] public at large, that [[Stephen Colbert]] recently issued the [[fanboi|Colbert Nation]] a challenge. That challenge?...to make McCain more interesting via his [http://www.colbertnation.com/?p=1593 '''Greenscreen Challenge'''].

==Colbert and [[TOW]]==

[[Image:Threatdown.jpg|thumb|right|Stephen Colbert...[[/b/]] incarnate?]]

[[Image:Colbert360kid.jpg|thumb|right|Yes, yes he is.]]

Colbert had always been held in high regard by many [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] and [[4chan]] [[newfags|users]] for having many [[unfunny|lulzy]] jokes on his show. However, on his August 1, 2006 show Mr. Colbert went above and beyond the call of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] duty when he urged viewers to vandalize [[TOW]]. 

His beef was '''[[nice try|Wikiality]]''' which he describes as TOW's version of [[bullshit|(user driven) "truth"]] as opposed to [[Veropedia|what is actually true]]. He explained that on Wikipedia "any user can change any entry, and if enough users agree with them, it becomes true." Thus, he argued, it would be easy to solve many of the world's problems if TOW reflected the "truth" to say there <i>were</i> no problems.

To prove his point, he urged the Colbert Nation to change the "endangered" status of African elephants to being <u>off</u> the endangered list by going onto Wikipedia and edit the article on elephants so that it would say: '''Elephant population in Africa has tripled over the past six months.'''

The [[Wikipedo|Wikipedos]] [[shit]] their pants as [[at least 100|at least 1,000,000]] people added the lulz to all the articles on elephants and crashed all of their servers. They ended up banning [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Stephencolbert him] out of spite. Even more awesome is the fact that what he posted on Wikipedia [[LOL_WUT|actually came true]]. [http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/76929/october-18-2006/elephant-vasectomies] Thus proving the [[bullshit|objectivity]] of TOW.
===Wikilobbying===
Colbert also has beef with what he calls "'''Wikilobbying'''" which he described as "'''when money determines Wikipedia entries, reality has become a commodity'''", alluding to a case where [[Microsoft]] got busted for hiring someone to "pretty up" their TOW entry. He also bagged on "Self-determination", where corporations are allowed to [[MMORPG|act out their fantasies online]] by editing their own Wikipedia entries. Colbert described Wikipedia as, "''[[Second Life]]'' for corporations", saying if a sleazy corporation wants to pretend to be squeaky clean online, then that is [[sock|their business]].

===ED Approved===

''The Colbert Report'' gets the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] seal of approval for thoroughly pwning Wikipedia.

==[[Canadia's History]]/[[The Beaver]]==
[[File:PussyPatrol.jpg|thumb|300px|Colbert likes to keep all teh pussy to himself]]
On the February 4th, 2010 show, Colbert had a piece on Canadia's 'national magazine' which -for about a hundred years- had been called [[The Beaver]]. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/business/media/25history.html  Apparently, they had to change the name] since The Beaver's online version kept getting blocked by Internets [[pr0n]] filters.

After the publisher changed the name to ''[[Canada's History]]'' Colbert decided that [[trolling|bold action]] was in order and commanded the Colbert Nation to go to [[Urban Dictionary]] and make entries for "Canada's History" to define the most [[list of sex acts|depraved sex act]] imaginable. 

The Nation responded, not only by spamming up [[UD]] but taking the hijinx to [[TOW]]'s page on [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Canada&diff=next&oldid=342042368 The History of Canada].

{{quote|A seldom accomplished, extremely depraved sex act too vile to describe, the ''Canada's History'' involves [[tramp stamp|moose antlers]], a bottle of maple syrup, and the [[ice hockey|Stanley Cup]]|Colbert}}

So far so good. [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=canada%27s%20history&page=59] [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=canadas+history]

==The Stephen Colbert [[WTF|Hid]]== 

He also successfully engineered and led a Colbert Nation [http://www.colbertnation.com/] [[raid|campaign]] to have a new bridge in Budapest named after him by flooding an official Hungarian government [[website]] [http://www.m0hid.gov.hu/elsofordulo] with bot generated [[AIDS|votes]] for The Stephen Colbert Hid (bridge).

Although he handily won the naming rights in two rounds of voting (final results can be seen here [http://www.m0hid.gov.hu/toplista]), the Hungarian government sent their Ambassador to the United States (ya rly) to ''The Colbert Report'' where they proceeded to [[Habbo_/B/lockade#POOL.27S_CLOSED_HOTEL.27S_CLOSED|weasel out of the deal]] by pointing out that the fine-print necessitated that he not only had to be fluent in Hungarian but he also needed to be dead [http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/75462/september-14-2006/andras-simonyi].

Upon hearing the news, outraged Hungarian Colbert Nationalists stormed the Hungarian Parliament, demanding that [[fag|Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany]] resign after it was revealed he lied to the country about Mr. Colbert in order to win re-election last April. [http://www.budapestsun.com/full_story.asp?ArticleId=%7B4194E2CB4F4F477CBA29B26FB2CCC79C%7D&From=News]

As of this writing, the stalemate over the naming rights and the resulting riots has all the hallmarks of a [[serious]] [[AIDS|International Incident]]. Accordingly, United Nations Supreme Leader [[buttsecks|Hugo Chavez]], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IoCmmm2UG0] has ordered a peacekeeping force to the areas to kill the [[Jews]].

==Call 1-888-OOPS-JEW==
[[Image:Atone_phone.jpg|thumb|left|Colbert mans the '''Atone Phone'''.]]
[[File:Oopsjew colbert.png|thumb|Jews: tweet your crimes against Dr. Colbert with the hashtag '''#oopsjew''']]
After it was recently revealed to him by a [[scientist]] that since he's of [[inbred|European stock]], he has a 75% chance of being an Ashkenazi (German) Jew, Colbert re-installed his special [http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2006/09/call_1888oopsje.html phone line] to allow his Jewish "friends" to call him to apologize during their ongoing [[butthurt|Days of Atonement]] holiday.

As of yet, no Jew has apologized for pwning [[Jesus]] or [[jews did wtc|9/11]] but this is expected since jews are too busy counting their [[jew gold]] to apologize. 

Colbert has also created some [[butthurt]] from audience Jew with a [[shoop]]ed image of a [[troll|fake]] airline called '''Air Aryan''' ("the airline with the most overhead arm room sponsored David Duke") and a [[Holocaust]] denial comment directed at Jews whilst roleplaying [[Iran]]ian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]:

{{quote|Ya’ll didn’t get killed by them Nazis!|<strike>Stephen Colbert</strike> Mahmoud Ahmadinejad}}

For [[2010]], the tech-savvy Dr. Colbert added a new way for Jews to apologise to him. If you are a Jew who has offended Stephen, you can [[tweet]] your crimes using the hashtag '''#oopsjew''' either directly to [https://twitter.com/stephenathome @StephenAtHome] or openly for all to see.

[[Image:Doingitcolbert.jpg|thumb|220px|Colbert 08 Announced]]

[[Last Thursday]], Stephen Colbert announced on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' to Jew that he is running for president of the [[USA]].

{{quote|Because tonight, I Stephen Colbert am officially announcing that I have decided to officially consider whether or not I will announce that I am running for President of the United States...and I will be making an announcement of that decision very soon...preferably on a more prestigious show.|Stephen Colbert}}

Later on ''The Colbert Report'', a much more prestigious show, Stephen announced that:

{{quote|After nearly 15 minutes of soul searching, I have heard the call...Nation, I SHALL SEEK THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!|Stephen Colbert}}

He has entered the primaries in [[South Carolina]] as part of the "Favorite Son". For many of his [[13 year old boy|13-year-old]] [[fanboi|fans]], this was the first time they encountered such hilariously [[Hot Topic|edgy]] humor, though ''MAD Magazine'' has done this [[shit|shtick]] since the 1950s. [[Old meme]] is old.

A possible combination of bumper stickers might be:
*Colbert/[[Mike Huckabee|Huckabee]]
*Colbert/[[Stalin|Putin]]
*Colbert/Colbert

<strike>It is also suggested that people write him in for President in '08.  As many as possible.</strike> [[Barack Obama|NIGGER GOT ELECTED]].

*[http://www.ifilm.com/episode/23427/startsWith/2903787 The official announcement]

Colbert's original intention was to run in both the [[Nazi|Republican]] and [[Communist|Democratic]] primaries. Due to "[[the man]]'s" [[gay|fascist]] federal election laws, Colbert was required to limit his campaign spending to $5,000 to avoid getting a free one way ticket to meet [[Bubba]]. The Republicans wanted $35,000 from him to file his intent to run. The Democrats wanted $2,500. Needless to say, Colbert's ambition to lose twice was quickly [[pwnt|killed]], and he [[pussy|submitted]] to the Jew.

[[Last Thursday]], the [[hillbilly|South Carolina]] Democratic Party's Executive Committee voted 13-3 in favor of keeping Colbert off the ballot, stating that he is not a "nationally viable" candidate as he is only running in one state. The truthiness of the situation: they're just shitscared that [[over 9,000]] people would vote for him and make them all look fucking [[retarded]].

Speculation is that next week Colbert's giant sand-dragging brass [[balls]] will announce their intention to be running mates on an independent ticket. They're currently polling higher than [[Dennis Kucinich]] and [[shit nobody cares about|that douche from ''Law & Order'' that isn't Sam Waterston]].

==Colbert Pwns 2007==

[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/12/20/entertainment/e131210S40.DTL '''December 20 2007''']: Colbert kicks the shit out of ''[[Harry Potter]]'' author J.K Rofling, and <s>[[Global Warming]]'s</s> The [[Internet]]'s inventor [[Al Gore]] by being picked as [[Old Media|AP's]] '''Celebrity of the Year 2007'''.

As discussed, Colbert's sand-dragging balls did not even do an interview. Instead he sends this out via an undisclosed titty bar's free Internets service:

{{quote|In receiving this award, I am pleased that I was chosen over two great spinners of fantasy — J.K. Rowling and Al Gore.

==Galactic Overlord of Scientology==

[[Image:Colbert-Xenu-Node_3_march_13.png|thumb|'''COLBERT''' > MyYearbook?]]
In March 2009 Stephen Colbert officially announced that he has overthrown Lord [[Xenu]] as Galactic Overlord of [[Scientology]].  His first order was for the [[fanboys|Colbert Nation]] to go to [http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/name_ISS/index.html NASA's website] and vote to put his name on the International Space Station. However, [[Xenufag]] Anons that were still flogging the old, dead horse that was [[Chanology]] were already planning on having the ISS tagged as '''XENU''' so Colbert's orders were a poke in the eye they had on the prize. To counter Colbert's "[[troll|dick move]]" the Chanology leaderfags who delivered the original "Message to Scientology" vidya threw down a YouTube fatwa on Colbert.

==Colbert's DNA shot into space==

On September 8, 2008, it was reported that, no matter what happens to the fucktards on planet Earth, Stephen Colbert would ultimately live on, proving once again that he is better than [[you]]. This is thanks, in part, to less-than-important [[video game]] designer [[Richard Garriott]], who is being shot into space at [[over 9,000]] mph. He will travel to the International Space Station, which has been good for practically nothing, except that Garriott will use the space station to shoot Stephen Colbert's hot load of impressive DNA into space so that, just in case some alien race finds it, Stephen Colbert and the human race can live on.

{{quote|I am thrilled to have my DNA shot into space, as this brings me one step closer to my lifelong dream of being the baby at the end of 2001.|Stephen Colbert}}

==Operation Restoring Truthiness==
''See article at: [[Operation Restoring Truthiness]]''.

'''Operation Restoring Truthiness''' is a [[viral]] Internets campaign to get Stephen Colbert to hold a rally at the National Mall in Washington DC in the Fall of [[2010]] in order to [[pwn]] known liar [[Glenn Beck]] (who raped and murdered a young girl in 1990) for [[unwarranted self-importance]] and [[LARP]]ing [http://worldmeets.us/elmercurioes000001.shtm Hitler].

==Mr. Colbert Goes To Washington==
[[File:Fox_butthurt_colbert.png|thumb|[[Faux News]] gets butthurt that they weren't invited.]]
On Friday Septembert 24, 2010, Stephen put his überballs onto a truck and took off for Washington DC to testify before the Subcommittee on [[Beaners|Immigration, Citizenship and Border Security]]. This after he tried his hand as a [[mexican|day labourer]] [http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/360017/september-23-2010/fallback-position---migrant-worker-pt--2 picking beans in a field in upstate New York] for a bit on his Thursday show called ''"Stephen Colbert's Fallback Position"'' in which he tries other jobs incase his job as a pundit is outsourced to [[China]]. Just minutes upon Colbert's arrival, Rep. John Conyers ([[douche|D]]-Mich.), the committee's [[Final Boss]], tried to [[banhammer]] Colbert from testifying. 

{{quote|You run your show, we run the committee.|Conyers}}

Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), who invited Colbert to the hearing, told Conyers to [[STFU]] and let Mr. Colbert have at it with his 5-minute statement detailing his "vast" knowledge of farming.
