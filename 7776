Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic

'''''[[Star Wars]]: Knights of the Old Republic''''' is a western [[RPG]] by BioWare for the [[Xbox]] and [[PC]]. Abbreviated "KOTOR", it is wildly popular, especially because of the faggy [[SWTOR]] [[MMORPG]] that is being released probably in [[2012]] or something. The first game (considered the better of the two) has you, an [[autism|amnesiac]] person working for the [[America|Republic]], and over time you gain [[fags|pals]] who will assist you in your quest for finding the Star Forge.


==Gameplay==
[[File:MalakRecruiter.jpg|thumb|right|Malak before his jaw was [[pwned]].]]
It's a BioWare game. Expect a lot of [[tl;dr]] shit about how some woman's family was blown up by the Mandalores or some shit. But anyway, you can either choose from the soldier class (fighter type, upgrades to Jedi guardian), scoundrel (low health/high damage type, upgrades to Jedi counselor), and scout (balanced class, upgrades to Jedi sentinel.) If you want to not have a headache throughout the first planet, Taris, you might as well pick the soldier class.

You can also do good and evil things. For example, when you see a hurt alien, you can either give him medicine for +light side points, or tell him to [[GET OUT|fuck off and die]] for +dark side points. It's impossible to be totally neutral because you're given a choice at the end [[Spoiler|when you must join the evil Bastila or try to stop her later on]]. The coolest thing you can do if you're evil, is to blow up a shark on Manaan and poison the water all while still avoiding being [[b&]] from there.

Also, be prepared to spend a lot of time looking at the map and backtracking all the fucking time on the beginning planet, Taris, or the water planet, Manaan. Especially Taris.

==Characters==

[[File:Juhani_x_revan.png|thumb|right|How to piss off Carth/Revan fangirls.]]
[[File:Jolee_Bindo_KotORCG.jpg|thumb|right|What Jolee spent his time doing.]]
Every single goddamn party member has some sort of backstory they don't want to talk about and it gets resolved somehow by the end of the game. Except T3-M4 because he just beeps.

*'''[[You|The Main Character]]''': The main character of the game. When you start the game, you can make the character a dude or a chick and choose what they look like. Even an [[Azn]] woman. Or a blonde bulldyke.

:*'''[[Spoiler|Darth Revan]]''': Canonically male, but can be female if the main character is one too. That's because Revan is the player character. Darth Malak tells Revan this when s/he is captured on the Leviathan. It turns out s/he and Malak went evil from their search of the Star Forge. When the Jedi boarded the Sith's ship, the Leviathan, Darth Revan was almost killed by Bastila but saved at the last second, causing him/her to get amnesia.

*'''[[Evil|Darth Malak]]''': Darth Malak is a guy that looks like [[Avatar the Last Airbender|the fag from that kind-of-animu show]] except he's actually tough. He's missing his jaw because Revan [[I accidentally|accidentally]] knocked it off with a lightsaber. He used to be the apprentice of Revan, until both went evil from trying to find the Star Forge.

*'''[[Faggot|Carth Onasi]]''': Carth is a human guy in his late thirties that [[emo|whines]] all the time. It turns out he was betrayed by someone from the Republic, leaving his wife to be [[raep|killed]] and his son to join the Sith. If female Revan is [[straight|not a lesbian]], Carth may end up falling in love with her. Even if she's evil. This [[shipping]] is supported by 99% of the female fans and they wish it was [[canon]].

*'''[[Avatar (movie)|Mission Vao]]''': A [[loli]] blue Twi'lek who is first seen in Javyar's Cantina with her Wookiee [[BFF]] Zaalbar on Taris. After he's rescued, Mission slowly begins to talk about her deadbeat brother who has a thing for money and getting in trouble. Turns out the [[Insane|Sand People]] captured him, and [[Prostitution|he offers his sister a lot of money]] when freed. [[Faggot|He never comes back]]. If you're evil, you can tell her to [[stfu]] forever by killing her and Zaalbar... or getting Zaalbar to [[pwn]] her death. [[Awesome]].

*'''[[Furry|Zaalbar]]''': A Wookiee and the [[BFF]] of Mission. When Revan, Mission, and Carth save him from Gamorrean slavers, he [[homo|pledges his life to Revan]]. Then on his homeland of Kashyyyk he gets taken away because he said that [[Obama|Chuundar]] sucked as a leader and is selling their own people to [[the man]]. If you're good, [[Shit nobody cares about|Zaalbar helps the exiled old leader Freyyr take back leadership.]] Experts agree [[lulz|killing Mission]] was the only interesting thing he ever did.

*'''[[Bitch|Bastila Shan]]''': Pigtailed cunt Jedi who's captured on Taris and you have to save her. Upon her rescue, she claims that [[lie|she was able to handle it and she was faking.]] She continues to be a bitch until she realizes who exactly [[you|Revan]] [[loser|is]] and begins to share dreams with him/her. Then, on the Leviathan, she butts in a fight between Revan and Malak and is stuck fighting the latter, who captures her and [[raep|seduces her to the dark side]], making her a complete bitch AGAIN. You can go with her, try to [[boring|save her]], or [[win|kill her off]] at the end of the game.

*'''[[Robot|T3-M4]]''': An annoying little droid that beeps and fires lasers and stuff.

*'''[[Duke Nukem|Canderous Ordo]]''': Man, this guy with graying hair is such a [[badass]]. He carries a big-ass gun and lives for war and honor. He's a Mandalorian. You know, like [[mc chris|Boba Fett]]. He and Juhani don't like each other. When he first meets Revan, he says [[USI|"I'm someone you don't want to get on the bad side of."]]. While he's the first evil person that joins you, he still bitches you out for doing really [[asshole]] things like stealing shit.

*'''[[Lesbian|Juhani]]''': A lesbian Jedi with a vaguely Eastern European accent. Do not fret, though! While she's a [[Furry|Cathar]], she barely even qualifies for [[kemonomimi]]. Really all she has is pointy ears and a topknot and funny eyes. She freaked out and [[pwn|killed her Jedi master]], but if you don't kill her, she'll be forgiven by everyone. She had a friend named Belaya that she "spent so many nights under the stars with." Riight.

*'''[[Awesome|HK-47]]''': The robot people actually care about. He's an evil robot that wants to [[delete fucking everything|kill fucking everything]] and is only restrained by his master. He likes to refer to humans as meatbags. When he's fully repaired, he recalls that Revan actually built him. By far the most popular character. {{youtube|Vg1gTas7OAA|See why here!}}

*'''[[Old|Jolee Bindo]]''': A neutral Jedi that lives in a tree on the forest floor of Kashyyyk. He's a wise old black man who gets grumpy and cranky all the time. His wife fell to the dark side and he just couldn't kill her, and let her go. She was eventually killed in a war. Some of the Jedi Council said he learned a hard lesson and he got sick of their crap and left. He does not want to talk about this shit until Revan keeps bothering him over and over and over. If Revan is evil, he and Juhani will get killed off at the end when they are like [[Moralfag|"REVAN NO BEING BAD IS BAD!"]]

==Fandom==
The [[fandom]] may be scarier than any other sect of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[loser|fandom]]. Why? [[Shipping]]. And how.
===Carth/Revan Fangirls===
Holy Jesus. It's like the [[16 year old girl|fangirls]] use female Revan as some sort of [[Twilight|Mary Sue]]. This gallery speaks for itself.

=The Sequel=

{{spoilers|KREIA BETRAYS YOU AND BECOMES DARTH [[Pun|TRAYA]], THE FINAL BOSS! SHE ALSO KILLS THE REMAINING JEDI MASTERS WHO ARE PISSED OFF AT YOU, UNLESS YOU'RE EVIL, YOU KILL THEM!

'''''[[Star Wars]]: Knights of the Old Republic II: The [[Shit|Sith]] Lords: [[Electric Boogaloo]]''''' (called KOTOR 2 because of the fucking [[long]] name) is the sequel made by Obsidian for the PC and Xbox. It was considered a disappointment in comparison to the first game since it was buggy, and because there is a lot of [[cut]] content. Some of the quests felt like they were lifted from a MMORPG, such as [[Derp|run here, talk to this person, go back, kill something, go to the person again]]. Also, the plot felt like a [[fanfiction]] at the end because Kreia [[Stupid|tells the Exile what happens to everyone]], and then a 30-second cutscene of the Ebon Hawk flying away leads to the credits.

==Characters==
[[File:Visas_marr_irl.jpg|thumb|Visas Marr [[irl]].]]
[[File:Mira_evil_bao_dur.jpg|thumb|Bao-Dur and Mira fall to the dark side... and fuck.]]
[[File:Kotor_2_evil_end.PNG|thumb|The evil Exile, about to push Kreia into the Trayus Core, [[Sparta]]-style.]]
*'''[[You|The Jedi Exile]]''': Canonically female, the Exile was told to [[GET OUT]] by the [[Sysops|Jedi Council]] for running off to fight the [[mc chris|Mandalorian War]] with Darth Revan. Because of this, the Force was stripped away from her. As she levels up she gains powers back slowly, whether she is light side or dark side. She also has problems remembering things and-[[Lazy|OH WAIT WHERE DID WE SEE THIS SHIT BEFORE? KOTOR 1.]]
*'''[[Old|Kreia]]''': A manipulative old woman who hates the Force. She's neither good or evil until the very end, where she aligns with the dark side and becomes Darth Traya. Darth Sion pwns her hand off at the start of the game, making her the first playable elderly amputated woman in a game. She yells at the Exile all the time and scolds her for being nice, for being a jerk, for breathing, [[fucking everything]]. She also explains what happens to the other party members at the end, [[fanfiction]]-style, right before dying.
*'''[[Pervert|Atton Rand]]''': A gambler that, after some twi'leks bring it up, deals with his crazy past where he choked some woman he loved to death. He has major trust issues. He also plays a card game called [[Yugioh|pazaak]] in his head, so he probably has [[Asperger's syndrome]]. When the Exile first sees him, [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Atton_Rand he stares at her tits. Really.] According to Mical, he doesn't bathe.
*'''[[Pain|Darth Sion]]''': The Lord of Pain. He actually made the [[Pain Series]] himself, no seriously, look it up. He looks undead, with his skin falling off and everything. The [[Crap|Force]] is the only thing keeping him alive. He admits he thinks the female Exile's [[hawt]] before dying.
*'''[[Clown|Darth Nihilus]]''': Some clown-faced Sith that bosses Visas Marr around. He talks some language that sounds like "FhshdkahwJHAKHShkshadhkaw" and that's it. Really. He also represents one of the most hyped-up but ultimately lame boss characters in any game up to date. Nihilus manages to get himself chopped up in a matter of seconds and with zero effort.  Oh, and he appeared on [[Howard Stern]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxUWtNJICVY once.]
*'''[[Fist|Bao-Dur]]''': An Iridonian cyborg who built his own floating sphere thingy, and served under the Exile in the Mandalorian War. He's very soft-spoken and [[fangirl]]s fucking love this. [[Fisting|His arm isn't just for show, General.]]
**'''[[Kawaii|Bao-Dur's Remote]]''': The little droid that follows around Bao-Dur. This is the most developed character in the game, and many scholars have written thesis papers on it.
*'''[[Pwned|Visas Marr]]''': No relation to [[EverQuest|Mithaniel Marr]]. Visas is a blind Sith who wears a [[Muslim|veil over her head]]. Her home planet, Katarr, was blown up. Her master is Darth Nihilus who chokes her and throws her around and goes [[Fritzl]] on her all the time.
*'''[[Black|G0-T0]]''': A floating [[fat]] [[black]] droid that [[cyberbullying|bullies]] around Bao-Dur's remote. He was a gift to the Exile after the crime lord Goto captured her. Aside from HK-47, he's the least annoying droid.
*'''[[Awesome|HK-47]]''': Fuck yeah, he's back! Except he needs a fresh coat of [[period|red paint]]. Like Hanharr, if you [[pwn]] some random innocent [[fag]], he high-fives you and [[gg|praises]] you. You can put a [[pussy|pacifism chip]] into him to make him less bloodthirsty, and turn him into flower-picking peace-loving [[hippy]]. It's so disturbing that the chracters make him back to [[awesome|normal]].
*'''[[Robot|T3-M4]]''': He returns as well, and is actually useful this time because he stores data and can upgrade shit. Bao-Dur fanboys all over him.
*'''[[Duke Nukem|Mandalore]]''': HOLY SHIT IT'S CANDEROUS ORDO, under the new name of Mandalore. He leads the Mandalorians, and is still all uppity about [[dumb|honor]] and shit. He's still a badass though.
*'''[[Faggot|Mical, the Disciple]]''': A blonde-haired scholar who reads books all the damn time, and falls for the Exile if she's a she. He is hated by Atton fangirls who like to draw him being choked and maimed. Because a gambling pervert who murdered a girl once is better than some fag who reads books and is actually employed, amirite? He only joins if the Exile is female.
*'''[[Bitch|Brianna, the Handmaiden]]''': Aside from Visas, this is the other male Exile's love interest. Her sisters tell her off because she assisted the [[Jedi]] Exile. She only joins if the Exile's male. Oh, and she duels in her underwear.
*'''[[Wookieepedia|Hanharr]]''': An [[evil]] wookiee who only joins you if you're evil as well. He's fucking obsessed with [[Fucking|tearing]] the shit out of Mira. He also has a [[tard]] [[rage]] mode that boosts his attacks.
*'''[[Paramore|Mira]]''': Feminist [[ginger]] with a gun, who has man problems. If the main character is male, he can ask her out, but she'll tell him off. It's probably for the best because she's obsessed with "hunting." Also, she dresses like a [[whore]] because it makes men easier targets for her.

==Cut Content==
[[File:Visas_Marr_by_Sakara_Siluria.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Some [[cosplay]].]]
What pissed off KOTOR fans the most was that so much content was cut. This is because LucasArts forced Obsidian to rush the game for it to be released in time for the 2004 holidays. [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Cut_content_from_Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_II:_The_Sith_Lords There's a whole list of this shit.] Some stuff that stands out is Atton getting a lap dance, Carth's son's dead body, the entire fucking planet of M4-78, Atton getting his arm chopped off by Darth Sion, and Bao-Dur killing himself.

A group of fans called Team Gizka are attempting to restore most of the cut shit. Some other modders named Team Exile tried to get at the stuff that Team Gizka didn't touch, but then a drama-fest erupted and people bitched at some guy called Darth Balor. They then [[gtfo|disbanded]].

Darth Balor came back as "Pikmin" and started another project but [http://knightsoftheoldrepublic.filefront.com/news/Darth_Balor_Came_Back_and_Tried_to_Fool_Us_as_Pikmin;41612 people found out].

All this over cut content like G0-T0 mentioning he shouldn't be in Vogga the Hutt's chambers.
