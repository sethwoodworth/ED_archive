'''The crocoduck''' is a stroke of genius used by former child star turned [[retard|fundamentalist]] [[Christian]], Kirk Cameron as an elegant scientific refutation to the theory of [[evolution]], from an idea related to him by his best friend [[Good Person Test|Ray Comfort]], who had stolen it off a small child he once sold some tadpoles to. After being pwned by some douchebag from the [[Rational Response Squad]] in a pissing contest over [[God]], the butthurt Cameron appeared on [[Bill O'Reilly]] to prove once and for all that a deity of some kind does exist and that [[God Hates Fags|he probably hates you]]. Basically, his argument is that because [[noone]] has ever found evidence of a cross between a crocodile and a duck then it follows that the entire theory of evolution is wrong. No srsly.

Behold the Crocoduck in all its glory:

==Crocoduck Pals==
Not content with looking like an ass twice in one week, Cameron also proposed the following crosses in case Crocoduck is in fact real. Ironically, every last one is more likely to be found before any proof of this God thing he keeps mentioning turns up.
