JournelFen is operated and maintained by inferior web hosting company [http://www.mediawood.com/media1/index.php?pr=Hosting_Plans&PHPSESSID=13c29e76e6ac5c06f5f5fed56cece5fe MediaWood]. DreamHost is better.

Normally it is 12 billion dollars to create a JournalFen account.  JournalFen is notable for Fandom_wank, the MisScribe story and not much else.
