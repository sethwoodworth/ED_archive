'''6-chan''' is a Chilean board created in July, 2008. The administrator is Takato, a [[Gay|straight]] man who does nothing with his life. This chan begins as a Chilean-style [[4chan]] by some guy that manages other [[nobody cares|SO KEWL forum]] for [[weeaboo|anime fans]]. During its first half, 6-chan acievement acquired a large sum of /ñ/oños (chilean version of [[b/|/b/tards]]), happy to join the mass of the site.

Now is directed by Sebastián Piraña, Emperor of Chile.

==Beginnings==
===2006===
When [[God]] created heaven and earth, [[Madonna]] gives birth to a inappropriate, sexual problems and delusions of grandeur; Takato, who wants to turn his biggest dream in reality: be the chilean [[moot|little girl]] and to be officially recognized as the world's global bitch. The site is set up at some point in 2006 as a [[crap|beta testin]], and Takato begins to plan how the site'll be, making some boards for personal use, and much [[yaoi]] and [[shota]] only to maintain his [[Fap|fapfolder]] full of porn.

===2007===
In October 26, Takato launches a website just for his [[Homosexuality|gay friends]], announces it on the Ippai Forums, and quickly runs the site along with 3d0, creator of the Fail Planet and possibly the unknown father of Takato. This site remains empty for eight months, with two post per week, until in July 6, 2008 Takato creates /ñ/ and all the chileanfags of [[4chan]] migrating to /ñ/. The activity of 6-chan gets duplicated and so much [[original content]] and [[forced memes]] was posted.

===2008===
In July, Takato decides to launch the site again with new boards, for all tastes and faggots from other imageboards. Then he creates a thread on [[4chan]] announcing the creation of a new board called /ñ/, with chileanons who felt roneries at 4chan and decided to aim Takato.<br />
Quickly, 6-chan became notorious and with no-cancer (I-I-I-Impossible!!!), but only with the moderators posting in the board, but with a little /b/lackup and some anons inviting his friends and family, /ñ/ become a board with great Chilean power.

===2009===
At the beginning of this year, the cancer and AIDS started spreading. Noone knows how this was possible. At mid-2009, 6-chan started to look like a fucking [[4chan|4ch0n]]-wannabe, so every oldfag started to cry and the most of them just left the imageboard. A new age of cancer and shadow started. ;_;

===2010===
The cancer has been rectified by the grammarnazis, now at least the [[you | retards]] write good enough to understand what their saying.
A lot of people post on 6-chan, the rate of post grow up like an 400% since 2009(shitty threads, boring stuff, etc etc). But the day of the [[zalgo | cancerkiller]] will COME!

This day was a August 11th, day he assumed control of the administration, the highest excellence, [http://www.twitter.com/sebastianpirana/ Lord Sebastian Piraña][[File:Bienvenidopirana.png]]

In his welcome message, promised to change the way the rule the new empire, but until today, nothing has changed, only the cancer and AIDS has grown to alarming levels, especially now that accept proxy connections from foreigners.

==Bards==
Because of a mistyping from Takato, the boards are now well-known as '''bards'''.
