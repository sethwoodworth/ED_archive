'''''Furcadia''''' is the epitome of everything you've ever feared on the [[internet]]z. It is a [[furry]] themed [[MMORPG]] with no actual game elements created by some [[Jewish|kike]] [[faggot]] named 'Felorin' around 1996. The "game" has not really been updated ever since, except to add more shit people need to [[WTF|pay to use]]. After over 12 years, the game is still in Beta.

The online gaming environment is non-game like, which is the main reason non-furry people do not play it. Seriously, there is <u>no actual gameplay</u>, ''Furcadia'' is not a game. It's really more like a mass [[castration|furry grave]] waiting to happen. 

__TOC__

==Furcadia's Staff==

Furcadia has a staff of about seven: [[fag|felorin]], [[Alzheimers|Talzhemir]], [[cancer|Emerald Flame]], [[Asspie|Gar]] and a [[shit nobody cares about|bunch of other sad fags]] making up Dragon's Eye Productions (DEP). Well, at least they used to be until about half the crew jumped ship to go somewhere more [[profit]]able.

The faggotry of Dragon's Eye Productions is near-legendary. Then again, with a name like that why wouldn't they be fags? Does the dragon's eye blink when filled with [[bukkake]]? Felorin surely knows.


They are known for 
* [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|Not having Egos]]
* Using [[Art]] others have made uncredited (especially Gin Blossom)
* [[internet poor|Begging for money]] 
* [[lazy|Making others work for them]]
* [[Duke Nukem Forever| Really fast updates to their precious game]]
* [[faggotry|Being delightful people]]
* [[BAWW|Not being able to keep any outside staff for long]] (and they wonder why)


===Felorin (Dr. Cat)===
[[Image:TordpoolFurcadia.gif|right|thumb]]
Felorin, aka David Shapiro[http://www.notableultima.com/collectibles/OriginPeople.html], is a [[fag]] [[kike]] who is [[fail|amazingly]] both [[Wapanese]] and [[Furry]] at the same time! His favorite hobbies include [[pedo|Truth or Dare]] (he [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|Has his own Truth or Dare Pool in Furrabia]]), dressing as a [[furry|Tabby cat]] in a [[Japan|Kimono]], and trying to [[fail|convince people he's cool]]. 

Despite being marked as the "game's creator" and getting the most money out of everyone, he doesn't even really do anything anymore. His art sucks, he hasn't learned any new code in a decade, and he's too busy [[buttsex]]ing [[Weeaboos]] to work. In fact, he leaves all the coding to [[Europe|Sanctimonious]],<s> a guy who [http://furc.sanct.net/personal/index.htm already has a paying job elsewhere] and could give a flying fuck less about Furcadia. Sanctimonious even lives in [[Europe]], so any money DEP paid him would be worth about as much as toilet paper anyhow.</s> [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:EmeraldFlame-BAWWW.JPG Sanctimonious was fired]! 

Now the coding is done by Farrier, Douglas Martens ("Rhynn"), and Tomáš  Dolejší ("Reunion"), neither of whom can code, either. Felorin himself (aka Dr. Cat) has jumped ship to work for [[lolcats|lol aps]]. More on that in a bit.

Perhaps the most horrifying thing about Felorin, AKA Dr. Cat, is that he was one of the designers of the original ''[[Ultima]]'' [[RPG]]s [http://www.notableultima.com/collectibles/OriginPeople.html]. This is likely the reason why ''Furcadia'''s interface [[lazy|looks like the ''Ultima 6'' game engine]]. The difference being that Furcadia is more like an immense chat room filled with people you [[hate]] and can't [[murder]] while Ultima was a game.

===Talzhemir===
[[Image:Smcybwlf.gif|thumb|right|some of Talzhemir's better "Art"]]
[[Image:Talzcat.gif|thumb|right|More Typical Talzehemir "art"]]

AKA Amanda Dee [http://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=katie+bazor&d=76343811707406&mkt=en-US&setlang=en-US&w=9863b633,e8ec89cf] and/or Carolyn Danvers from Pflugerville, [[Texas]] according to [http://myworld.ebay.com/talzhemir/ eBay] and [http://talzhemir1.deviantart.com/journal/23250171/ Deviant Art]. Until recently, she used to live in [http://web.archive.org/web/20010210013716/www.bga.com/~pixel/rates.htm Austin, Texas].

Talzhemir is Furcadia's Artist...Or she used to be, before shuffling it all off on Emerald Flame, art stolen from others and used uncredited, and other sad people will not be paid. 

Despite all of this, she [[no|still works really hard on Furcadia]]. Really, guyz! It's not like she's carving [http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&item=110410546454#ShippingPayment really ugly wands with dull kitchen knives], [http://talzhemir1.deviantart.com/art/Suvara-Seafang-126670873 Playing Domain of Heroes], or [http://talzhemir1.deviantart.com/art/Dismount-the-Horse-125850209 Watching Chinese Opera on your dime]! Seriously, [[Internet poor|Furcadia ''needs'' the money]] so she works really, really hard! [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]!

Still, despite being no longer the art lead, she keeps up with the latest technology. On June 4th, 2008 she created a thread to show off her [[fail|incredibly up-to-date art skillz]]: ''[[:Image:Outoftouchfurc.PNG|What 3d Programs Do You Use?]] '' Apparently she's so out of touch she is making a poll to find good software to use... and deleted the moved thread within 8 hours of it's creation, though she forgot to delete the "moved" placeholder, showing all the world her [[epic]] [[fail]].

She has been known for buying [[cock|Bull Penis]] "[http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?furcadia_session_id=12458-gaok-rpx&showtopic=60439 For her Dog]" and will complain very loudly if it's not 100% real bull penis. Her "[[bestiality|pets]]" are [[PoeticIrony|more important]] than Furcadia is to her.

===Emerald Flame===
[[Image:FerianWolfen-Furcadia.GIF|thumb|right|She [[trace|worked so hard]] on the [[wajas|hideous wolf]]!]]
[[File:Emmie9.jpg|thumb|150px|Her actual artwork. Everything on Furcadia is [[trace]]d.]]
Protip: call her Cancer Girl. She loves it!

Katie Bazor [http://www.furcadia.com/credits/] AKA Emerald Flame started out in about 1998 or 1999 as the self-important fairy/elf otherkin runner of the [[gay|"Sanctuary"]], an elitist group that would only let friends of friends join their [[buttsex| Rape Circle]]. She seems to mistake being part of a volunteer guild unrelated to the game staff as being on the staff and likes to claim [[Lies|she has been working for DEP the entire time]].

Being the leader of the largest guild at the time was not enough attention for the [[attention whore]] and so, after several nights of [[Felching|sucking cum out of Talzhemir's fat ass]], she was upgraded to staff member, then to "lead artist".

She is starting to shuffle the art duties off on other people, just like her forebearer did. What she does do is always half-assed: all her avatars have the same poses,  many of which are simply flipped versions of the same damned pose. [[WTF|People still pay for it]], even though it's obvious she's a lazy hack with a copy of photoshop.

When not drawing half-assed animals with [[shitty]] anatomy, she's [[:Image:NOsuggestions-Furcadia.jpg|Publicly attacking people over the forums]] and passing out arbitrary bans. Like all [[otherkin]], her skin is thinner than July ice and it readily shows as apparently anything she dislikes is "trolling" while [[:Image:Troll-troll-Furcadia.PNG|actual trolls go ignored]]. [[Bipolar|Alternatively]], she may pretend to shit rainbows by covering her message with smilies as fake as the coon stripes in a [[scene kid]]'s hair, but which somehow a lot of [[retards|players]] take to be sincere.

The only reason she was not fired was because she's busy [[:Image:Emerald_Flame_x_Felorin_WTF.JPG|sucking Felorin's AIDS-riddled dick every single night]]. This brings up a scary question: Either the [[faggotry|Magic]] of the [[Otherkin]] has made Felorin [[fag|Straight]], or is Emerald Flame is a [[Trap]]? More likely, it's just a sham done for the insurance. 

She has finally jumped ship, leaving Tiggerbaby to take up the [[traced|art duties]]. 

=====Cancer Girls's Medical Saga=====
[[Image:Cancer-Furcadia.jpg|thumb|right|Cancer Girl can't go home for Xmas]]
[[Image:Furcadia-still Cancerous.jpg|thumb|right|Cancer Girl still Cancerous in 2009]]
Back in 2005, Katie Bazor caught cancer while working for DEP. Perhaps her [[otherkin]]ness mixing with the fag rays from DEP was the cause; all we know is that she now has all the players of Furcadia paying for her medical bills "so she won't have to get a real job". She continually sucks the balls of the other staff while totally ignoring how she was forced to work and make public appearances instead of going home with her family during Christmas and getting cancer treatment.

In 2006, she starred in her own episode of [[House]] where she [http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?showtopic=31798 She Tripped Balls] on medication while being treated for fluid-filled lung, paralyzed kidney, [[Mr Hands|tears in her colon]] and other fun things that [[House|Gregory House]] thought were Lupus. Then she caught cancer again from more fag-ray exposure. 

In 2009 she revealed she still hasn't fucking recovered from the cancer after over four years of treatment on the players' of Furcadia's dime. She didn't even get help for years after suspecting something was wrong with her Thyroid. This pushes the timetable of Cancer Girl's medical exploits back to at least 2003 and her IQ down to [[retarded]].

=== Felorin & Emerald Flame leave Furcadia ===
On January 15, 2010, Felorin made a news post announcing that he has gotten a [[job|new full time job]] and that Emerald Flame was leaving to work elsewhere, too. He at first claimed it was no big deal as he and Talzhemir have had jobs outside of Furcadia in the past, [http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?showtopic=72368 then he said this]...

{{tinyquote|We're going to be promoting some of our existing staff to take over many of our current duties. They all have projects planned to improve Furcadia, get you better customer service, some new features, and generally improve things for all of you. There will be a few changes to who you go to for asking for various kinds of help with things in the game. We hope you'll all have good experiences with them, and we want to thank Rei-Jin, Ryhn, Talzhemir, Cironir, Farrier, and Tiggerbaby for all they'll be doing to keep Furcadia fun & thriving.}}

Ok, so the current staff has been "promoted", is making all the decisions, handles all support requests, and will be doing all the development from now on? Ladies and [[gentlemen]], [[fag|Dr Cat/Felorin]] and [[cancer|Emerald Flame]] have left the building! Even if the chain of command has changed expect Felorin and Emerald Flame to still be on Furcadia's Payroll despite the fact that ''they officially do nothing there now.'' 

So, if you hate what has been going on in Furcadia and want to keep sticking it to Emerald Flame, Felorin, and the rest of the furcadifags, boycott their new employers as well as Furcadia. While you're at it, feel free to contact their new employers and let the companies know [[retard|the kinds]] of [[furfag|people]] they have just foolishly hired. 

Also, all you current boycotters, [[gg|keep up the good work]]. You're starting to hurt them and it's starting to show. [[truth|Together, we can shut Furcadia down]].

=="Gameplay" Details==
[[Image:FREEWILLYOHSHIT.jpg|right|thumb|''Furcadia'' also doubles as a dating service.]]
Players choose pre-defined role-playing character images from a number of different animal species such as [[five-penised cows]], [[Shitting dick nipples|dick-nippled squirrels]], and [[Shitting dick nipples|shitting dick-nippled macro hermtaurs]]. These blobs of ugly pixels are referred to as "furres".  Players can change their furre's description, increase their genitalia, and cover themselves in excrement, but their sexual orientation is fixed at [[gay]] male--no furry has ever thought of changing this. 

Players can force their furres to assume three exciting sexual positions: ''sit, lay, and stand''. Players can [[yiff]] in user-created maps called "dreams" and every character in the massive furry chat room is entitled to make their own [[shit|fur-world]] with the [[Faggotry|fur-fantasy-feature]]. The local "Sex-map", Furrabian Nights, is literally clogged with these dreams. This is the height of everything [[gay]] about [[furries]].


Of course, with all these sex-crazed furries running around, you're going to need some kind of authority figure to keep the piece. And that's where [[internet police|guardians and beekins]] (most likely a misspelling of "beacon") come in. At the head of staff are [[Luser|Felorin]], [[Basement-dweller|Cironir]], and [[Fat|Talzhemir]]. They [[lie|keep the peace]] in ''Furcadia'' by establishing a [[Nazi]] government and [[Banhammer|permanently banning]] all who are any of the following (or a combination of the following):

A) Skinny,

B) "Mundane"/Non-Furry

C) One who opposes a dictatorship. 

Any and all who do not kiss their fat asses [[Ban|mysteriously vanish]].


===Typical Furcadian Character Descriptions===
'''Names have been removed to stop the morons from gloating that being featured on ED makes them [[fail|famous]] '''

<center>
{{morphquote|miquotes|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;
|'' I am a slave to my [[Pawfur|hindpaw/foot addiction]]~ I can't help it. I am always looking for a [[Trap|dominant girl]] to come and control me with her feet, tease me, and most of all, have fun while doing it. I am constantly [[sad|yiffy]] because of this.. I'm not looking for a relationship, just some fun.. Dominant ladies, if you'd like a foot slave, one willing to worship and massage your tired feet, whisper me~''
|--Desperate Bastard
|''Painted ringlets of a candied hue flowed like the waves of an endless breeze at sea, teasing and kissing dimpled cheeks. Long lashes veiled lovely, starry eyes, sparkling with every captivating smile from dainty little doe, full of warmth, child-like energy, and a genuine sweetness. Hour-glass body ticked this way and that, with fluid, graceful movements - like the sunlight itself; covered with buttery fur, licks of ivory specking alternating patterns over each and every curve. She carried an unconscious poise... charming, exquisite girl seeming completely out of place, with dainty elegance and a heart of gold that drove innocence and purity to its utter finest. Oh, that darling (name)!''

|--lazy bastard here for the nookie.
|''A stand-out from all the other girlybois, this pink and white kitty was still in touch with his masculinity. Muscular body sculpted, from broad shoulders, strong, built arms, and firm, dense pecs over a flat stomach; certainly no pushover. Face disctinctly male even from the deep purple glitter eyeshadow and black eyeliner, pink glitter shadow above. Spikey hair dyed deep rose with black undertones and sideburns, chin tuft also dyed. Slight crossdresser, violet g-string peeks above women's low-rider jeans adorned in rhinestones hugging curvy hips and a squeezable, rotund rear, navel pierced. Pink jeweled collar and silver bangles accessorize.''

===''Furcadia'' ''Furres'' You're Bound To Meet===

If you're brave enough to download and "play" ''Furcadia'' (keeping in mind there is no actual gameplay) you'll be forced to meet with many types of individuals. (By many, I mean two.) These people like to pretentiously refer to themselves as "Furres" which is just a fancy word for [[furfag]]. 

[[Image:Incest.PNG|thumb|right|Pwned]]

'''The Grammatically Impaired n00bs'''

These are the [[fugly|fresh-faced]], thirteen year old furry-sex loving future [[crackwhore]]s who can't spell and like to RP as ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Bleach]]'', or ''[[Inuyasha]]'' characters with cat ears having really bad [[yiff|Typefuck]] sessions while mommy isn't looking. They have no IRL friends and spend all day buffing their muffins to pictures of [[Traced|Sasuke with a dog tail]]. This is 50% of the Furcadia population.

[[Image:So --------true.PNG|thumb|right|Most populated area in the game.]]
'''The Biggest FurFags'''

The biggest furfags will play ''Furcadia'' and buy all the items (known as digos) and have tons of portraits with a description that mainly describes their fursona's boobs, penis, or vagina. About 90% of the furfags on this game are [[gay|bisexual]] and enjoy [[yiff]]ing. The furfags on ''Furcadia'' are usually [[fat|fat bitches]] in real life. Fat people usually don't get dates, and most of the furfags have NEVER had a date in their entire life, which caused them to join Furc and make a shitty character they think is sexy and will soon find themselves in the [http://www.crushyiffdestroy.com/show/furcadia Yiffy High School] sexing with another fat person who pretends to be skinny and sexy. 

'''The Roleplay Nazis'''

Furries aren't known for their skill in the English language. When most of Furcadia sounds like a [[lolcats]] convention, these are the people [[BAWW]]ing about it. So, listen to the psychedelic wet dream of a [[bestiality|scottsman]] and learn to use those fucking periods correctly!

The very same fucktards who complain about grammar are the ones who sit there and make three-page-long descriptions of squirrel dicks. Apparently it's [[fail|high art]] to go on and on and to flood the screen with text for five or ten minutes at a time while they prattle on and on about the shape of an imaginary ass.

Strangely, flooding the screen with meaningless gibberish, harassing other users for fun ("they don't spell like I do!") and posting porn everywhere does not count as [[troll]]ing in furcadia.

===Notable Furcadifags===
Their shit don't stink, but they'll rub your face into it. The best of the best, clearly, because they get the most pixel sex and [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|over 9,000]] fanarts.

Please use links only as there's enough fags here to have their own [[wikifur|wiki]]!

Included:
*[[SapphyDracases| Sapphirus]]
*[[Winged-Maniac| Paopu / Roxas / Elysse / Shoujo / Kaele]]
*[[Edward Elric| Edward]]

==Forever Free...==
[[Image:FlyingtoasterFurcadia.PNG|right|thumb|We can't make this shit up.]]
[[File:Fucktardia.PNG|right|thumb|$20 for a 5x5 pixel duck]]
Right about now you're probably thinking, ''"Oh god- I'd NEVER pay for that steaming pile of faggotry! Thank god Furcadia's slogan is Forever Free!"''

Think again.

Digos started out as shitty [[cock|wings for your furre]] that were instated to help pay server costs, but now these pay-to-use pieces of shit are overrunning the game... and the Biggest Furfags are buying them all for their [[Jew Gold]]! Here's a quick rundown of the shit people are paying for...

* 5 kinds of [[faggotry|wings]].
* 6 kinds of Regular animals for those [[bestiality|dog-fuckers]] to sodomize. 
* 9 Kinds of faggy species like [[FYIAD|dragons]] and [[gay|Unicorns]] with the ability to [[Twilight|shit sparkles]].
* All the Free species with less shitty graphics ("[[stupid|noble" furres]])
* Cookies (used to be free)
* Portraits to show off their [[Traced|Mad Art skillz]]
* Over 15 Tags: Pixel pictures that appear in their descriptions, rotating through the year.
* Over 6 kinds of really stupid "seasonal" avatars like Flying Toasters.
* Sponsorships (all of the above + beta testing and extra buttsex)
* Dream Packages: bigger dreams, [[moar]] [[coding|dragonspeak and phoenix speak]] and other shit they didn't used to limit.

...we're up to over 50 things already and [http://www.digomarket.com/ that's just the tip of the iceberg]. By the time you've read this they've probably added even more, many of which are totally useless or used to not cost any [[money]]. Why? [[Fat|Talzhemir]] needs [[moar]] [[hookers and blow]]! "Forever Free" my ass.

==The big graphics update & other lies==
The staff of Furcadia love to [[lie|Piss on their users and tell them it's raining]] and, the [[fag]]s [[2girls1cup|eat it up]], even though it's entirely [[bullshit]]. Even the players are [http://altmarket.net/index.php?topic=26957.0 really fucking tired of their faggotry.] This area will now proceed to expose DEP for the [[asshole|Lying sacks of shit]] they are. If you find more, add it!

Apparently Furcadia is finally trying to turn to 24 bit graphics, even though this is so outdated that it won't help much. But what are the details? It's all [[bullshit|hush-hush]] with releasable date of "[[Duke Nukem Forever|when it's done]]".

As to "never removing any features" or "never lessening any free features", remember that maps used to be 300x300 as default with the ability of going up to 600x600 and up to 999 lines of dragonspeak for FREE.  Now you have to pay for a 300x300 map with the same amount of coding.

But the DEP staff [[no|needs the money]]! They [[lies|work hard on Furcadia 24-7]] to ensure the game runs well! They must [[retarded|make everything themselves]]! Their staff is [[ITTY BITTY BABY ITTY BITTY BOAT|so small]], that's why it takes [[Duke Nukem Forever|forever]] to get anything done! [http://twitter.com/talzy Talzhemir's Twitter] will happily show that Furcadia is usually the least of her concerns and she, and the rest of the "Staff" are happily living on your [[Jew Gold]]. She would rather be carving [http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&item=110410546454#ShippingPayment Unbelievably Ugly Wands with dull kitchen knives] than working on Furcadia. 

But don't take our word for it, [[Furcadia/Finances|here's in their own words what your money is paying for]]... (there's a screenshot in the gallery to prove this is real)

[[TL;DR]]: [[Image:Talzhemir&staff.jpg|thumb|right|[[Retard|DEP]] wants your [[cock|Money]].]]
* Movie Nights for the staff

* Housing, Entertainment and other stuff for the staff of 7-10 people (they say they don't want real jobs!)

* Insurance for staff ([[lies|not that they didn't make Emerald Flame work full-time while suffering from Thyroid cancer to make a stupid talking wolf, or anything]])

* [[shit|sophisticated servers]] (a lie- check the gallery!)

* Advertisements for Furcadia

* Conventions with airfare and hotel rooms

* [[buttsex]].

[[Furcadia/Finances|The Full Text is here!]]

But what about the Digos? They must make those, right? Nope. In fact, a surprising number were taken, altered, then used without any credit whatsoever. 

'''Digo AKA Pay Version = Artist name ("Patch's real name")'''
* Dragon = Jagu/Israfel ("Dragon")
* triwings = Kestrel ("archangel wings")
* Bat wings = MedleyPony ("dragon wings"). 
* Therian Tygard & Leonine = Kaelin'yFiae ("Feral Lion Set", taken before she was "[[rape|hired]]")
* Therian Leonine =  Kaelin'yFiae ("Feral Lion Set", taken before she was "[[rape|hired]]")
* Woolie = Hellfire's Fury ("Feral Sheep")
* The Nobles are being drawn by someone from outside DEP. 
* [http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?showtopic=59975 Upcoming Chibi Wings] = Yoko ("Kiro Wing Patch")

There is a [http://furcadia.com/credits/ hidden credits list] DEP doesn't want you to know about- They don't even link it from [http://furcadia.com/ The main site], even though it's still hosted there to avoid lawsuit. It doesn't have all the artists credited, however, only the ones they stole directly from with zero alterations.

But the staff needs to be paid as they are professionals! [[whore|Professionals]] cost money! Yeah, [[whores|profressionals]] that started out as users and kissed ass to the top, [http://furcadia.com/credits/ most of which have quit] as they got sick of Talzhemir and Emerald Flame's bullshit.

[[Trolls trolling trolls]]? Check. [[BAWWW]]ing mods? Double check. A game made of nothing but [[fail]]? Welcome to [[Epic Fail|Failcadia]]!

==OMG-We got hacked!==
After repeated warnings to the staff of Furcadia by a well-intentioned hacker that using shitty C language code from 1995 was insecure and easy to hack were totally ignored with replies that can be summed up as "[[no|We are professionals, we know what we are doing, so piss off.]]" the hacker simply decided to show them how flawed their game is.

The hacker easily broke into the game on October 3, 2009, stole the admin Gar's password, and posted this message over the entire game:
{{squote|Due to the fact of Furcadia "Guardians" Freaking out when I absolutely asked them not to due to the sheer fact of network security, I'm going to put this into my own hands for now. Every user of Furcadia: your passwords have been compromised, although by a perfectly honest person. Whilst being so, some of you use the same passwords for your email accounts / paypal accounts or whatever else. Furcadia is going to be sieged by /b/ in a couple days from now. I suggest changing your passwords due too SQL Vulns and Simple Security Flaws none of which have yet to be fixed.|The [[Hacker]], [[pwned|posting as Gar]]}}

The hacker then banned all the mods and staff from the forums, and logged out. [[Over 9000]] [http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?furcadia_session_id=12621-oehr-ohb&showtopic=63066&view=findpost&p=421497 passwords were stolen and publicly posted], including a few of the staff members including Emerald Flame, Cironir, and Sanctimonious.

The hacker then continued to spread the [[Lulz]] with many more posts over the Furcadia systems. it took three days for them to get Gar's password fixed and over a week for everyone to be turned back to "normal", though there are silenced complaints about some people never getting their characters back as others stole the passwords and changed them. 
{{morphquote|miquotes2|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;
|'' ""Anonymously" does not exist on the interwebz. Furcadia in a sense uses simple password encryption aka sha. It is a simple format unsalted. And unlike md5. Which easily parces 2,000 passwords every 92 or so seconds. With proper gpu bruteforceing. Meaning that if your like "lol coming on here too yiff. Lets use the same password as mai paypal account its secure I'm sure it is. It really isn't. It is very important that every furry that is getting this message too change your password asap. Or you are gonna get bank runned by /b/tards when they strike."''
|--[[Bitches Don't Know|Furries don't know bout password safety]]
|'' I see this has occurred at least on my side from every furry community that I have helped. [[Furaffinity]] being the big one there. All those "OMG HARDWARE FAILUREEZZ" Dealt with me showing them what the fuck was wrong with there hardware and them being ungrateful and indigenous pricks in the end. They simply use you and ban you. "Because you show a proper security threat." OMG THAT UILDIAR GUY AGAIN OH SHIT B&. Due to the pure ignorance and flaws of the "Internet community" They always blame something else when another issue really occurred. "[[lies|Oh we had hardware failure]]". Government cover ups on teh interwebz? Omg epic news feedz!''
|--[[Bitches Don't Know|Furries don't know bout network security]]
|''Simple to the fact.: I told the guardian "Hay i has root access / everything else." Cironir Simply replied "Lol block coverup. lol" But hey you can't block the system! :D 5$ says that guardian gets fired. This is the kind of PR furcadia wouldn't want. Everyone give Guardian Cironir a h5! "''
| --[[Bitches Don't Know|Cironir don't know bout professionalism]]
|''And no [[lies|I'm not a member of 4chan]] or some personal "Army" I'm a simple White Hat who is spreading a message. If I was the above I wouldn't even bother doing this, I would simply leak the source code amongst other things. - Oh shi! In all news. Change your Password. Hell I suggest shutting down furcadia till you (the staff) fix your shit because you are endangering [[over 9000|over 4,000]] active users at any given time. Now that isn't very nice, is it?''

'''Note to next guy who hacks the system: post passwords on /B/ and/or ED instead of on Furcadia and spread the game code everywhere for extra lulz and longer fix times!'''

==Tied Up with a String==
Just a few days before [[Jesus|Christmas]], 2009, [[bitch|Emerald Flame]] announced that a new update was on the way with [[WTF|buyable Human Avatars]], even more [[bestiality|animals for them to fuck]], and portraits that allow the [[furfags]] to show their cum-stained characters in all their shit-filled glory! The new avatars were put on presale with the promise that they would be available for full use within a week when the update was posted.

The update never came. 

Dozens of angry threads were deleted and Narnia, a longtime DEP ballsucker and the owner of the FAM, Furcadia's largest fansite, was banned for showing displeasure at DEP's rip-off scam. The pot was seething and ready to boil over as furfags began to realize they [http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?furcadia_session_id=12621-oehr-ohb&showtopic=64980&view=findpost&p=429845 paid for shitty pixel art they can't even use] and that despite the unusable nature the time on the expiration was still ticking. All it took was one tiny thing to set off a [[lulz|lollercaust]]!

===What? No smoking?!?!===
In a stupid move worthy of [[Facepalm]], [[bitch|Emerald Flame]] released the new portrait rules and a thread for questions and answers about the upcoming new rules. According to the new rules, you can have your furry fucking in a field of [[weed]] and it's still PG, but if they are smoking anything at all (even the legal stuff) it's rated R. Oh, and no blood allowed around the [[babyfurs]], either!  

Over 5 pages of angry comments were deleted, all siting that it made no sense that something that people can do in public and is legal has higher restriction ranking than something that is illegal. Then, someone mentioned that animated portraits in Furcadia might cause seizures, to which the hypocrite Emerald Flame replied, "[[:Image:EmeraldFlame-medidouche.JPG|If you have seizures, GTFO the net. Lol.]]" This caused a massive backlash against DEP's uncaring and unprofessional attitude, especially towards Emerald Flame.

=== Reap What You Sow, Emerald Flame ===
As Furcadia's weekend apparently starts on Sunday and ends on Monday, most the mods were offline leaving plenty of time for many threads all calling out Emerald Flame for the bitch she is to stack up hundreds of posts. Some were flames, appropriately enough, though the vast majority were logical posts mentioning that it's a really bad idea for DEP staff to be total bastards publicly as it ruins the company image. Felorin replied by saying that [[:Image:DEP listens.jpg|Furcadia Does listen to it's players]] and by [[:Image:DEP- run by Emerald Flame.jpg|White Knighting for Emerald Flame]], revealing that she has the company by the balls and actually is the [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|Cancer that is Killing Furcadia]]!  

The staff of DEP then ignored the logic that letting Emerald Flame run things when she has [[retard|Zero PR skills]], is an [http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v451/Fillet/Misc/furc3.png obvious bitch who knows nothing about running a game] and is also tripping out on bad meds is a bad thing and proceeded to point fingers at players, claiming all the anger and bad things going on with Furcadia was somehow their own fault. The first one to be blamed was Narnia; the guy who runs the largest Furcadia fan site and even [http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?showtopic=31798 brought Emerald Flame flowers when she was very sick] yet still was [[ban hammer]]ed for suggesting that DEP reform their business practices. Wild accusations were flung by the DEP staff along with insults such as [http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?furcadia_session_id=12621-oehr-ohb&showtopic=65433&view=findpost&p=431773 calling unrelated players Narnia's Bulldogs], many of which were hastily deleted. 

When blaming Narnia [[fail]]ed to appease the people of Furcadia, [[bitch|Emerald Flame]] decided to blame someone who had been banned for months instead, [[:Image:NOsuggestions-Furcadia.jpg|Amy Gotcha]], adding in [[:Image:Ef threat.jpg|thinly veiled threats to release personal information publicly]]. [[no|Obviously many people showing unhappy attitudes and seeking change must all be the same person for Furcadia is a perfect place with staff that can do no wrong]]! As this stupid accusation was a source of great [[lulz]] to anyone with a brain instead of a source of fear, [[fag|Felorin]] locked all threads after a few minutes of [[Delete fucking everything]] and threatened banning if anything negative regarding the update or staff is discussed before the new update comes out.

Many Furcadians are encouraging each other to [http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?furcadia_session_id=12621-oehr-ohb&showtopic=65398&view=findpost&p=431568 Boycott buying from Furcadia] until Emerald Flame grows a brain. Ironically, [http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?furcadia_session_id=12621-oehr-ohb&showtopic=65452&view=findpost&p=431909 the only thread that was supporting DEP] through all of this was also locked. 

No threads were ever unlocked even when the update came out over a month and a half late.

== Dreamer's Day ==
Seeking even [[moar]] praise for their shitty pixel arts, a bunch of furcadifags led by Kaelin'yFiae created Dreamer's Day in 2009. The ego masturbation went on for weeks and the [[fags|artists]] enjoyed the benefits. A 2010 Dreamer's Day was planned to be just as [[fag]]gy and [[masturbation|wanktastic]] as the one before it, but the guy who bought the domain for them to use saw this page and came to his senses.

To put a stop to the faggotry, the [http://www.dreamersday.com Dreamer's Day website] was changed to a [[:Image:Dreamer'sday-baddream.JPG‎|lulzy image link]] to this ED article. To prevent furfags from seeing it, Felorin lied claiming there was trojans there. Everyone [[BAWWW]]ed [http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?furcadia_session_id=12658-qidw-oid&showtopic=66318&view=findpost&p=435868 over it loudly] about [[X? In My Y?|Trojans in their Dreamer's Day]] then added a hyphen to the address making it [http://www.dreamers-day.com http://www.dreamers-day.com]. Let's see how long until that page is hijacked, too?

Once the [[furfag]] responsible got threatened with being banned from his precious fapterial he restored the link and went crying to his [[Fat_Furries|Diehard Fans]] about it.


Remember that 2010 Dreamer's Day? It was supposed to be in June of 2010, but the retard running the thing has their computer [[divide by zero]], destroying everything (or at least that's what they said). Supposedly the backup files were given to another Furcadifag to let Dreamer's Day still happen. Well, it's obvious it's [[Duke Nukem Forever|never going to happen]] as to this day there isn't even a date set and with "all the files" at least a date should have been reset. Still, even though it's obvious there won't be a Dreamer's Day 2010, people are still [[buttsex|sitting there with their thumbs up their asses]] waiting.

= Trolling ''Furcadia'' =
[[Image:Troll-troll-Furcadia.PNG|thumb|They don't recognize trolls here....]]

In a strange, unexpected turn of events, [[trolling]] Furcadia is actually quite difficult. Why? [[facepalm|Every damn one of them is eager to join you.]] Still, if you can find what pisses them off, they topple jsut like any other furry.

So in the end, what do many furfags hate the most? Arguments and aggression, of course! Make an alt (which is not at all similar to you), get your main to Vinca and sit down on a random seat in front of a small crowd (or at least three) "furres" which are not AFK. Get your alt to stand next to you and then start screaming at your main some shit like "GTFO MY SEAT", switch to your main and argue back. Continue this for at least ten minutes, some others should now be engaging in argument, threatening to "report" you or swearing their arses off.

Alternatively, Just get a large group of alts, block all access to some area (e.g. lay in front of doors, stand in a circle around a popular portal). This has recently been made against the TOS and may get you [[B&]], however.

'''Other things they don't like:''' 
* "naming and shaming of other players on the forum"
* Spreading [[IRL]] info about people
* posting logfiles
*  Posting Whisper files online (may get you [[b&]], although Talzhemir says that posting Whispers to public areas on the game, as opposed to the forum, is A-okay)
*  "stealing" art and patches from others and not giving credit when [[shit|patches/art]] is used.
* Banning all black persons and [[jews]] [http://forums.furcadia.com/index.php?furcadia_session_id=12681-oczl-gih&showtopic=66831&view=findpost&p=437890 from your dreams]
