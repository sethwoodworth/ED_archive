'''Jan Maturbongs''' (moar liek Jan Masturdongs, [[amirite]]?) is a [[Scilon]] tuff guy in Amsterdam. His family came from Indonesia (the [[Netherlands]] used to own Indonesia, so there are lots of Indo welfare recipients - dole bludgers -  living there). In fact, his family came from the head-hunter part of Indonesia, so he thinks he's a bad-ass. He has been a cult member since around 1994. He works in "Division 6, Introduction Courses and Services." His wife Eva is a "FLAG-Trained word-clearer" and occasional "auditor" (Scilons need "word-clearers" because they literally are punished if they haven't studied in the dictionary every word they read in [[Hubbard]]'s books - and even then they still don't really understand the words, because Hubbard used special inaccurate non-standard meanings).

==Violence is blue (asbestos?)==
On the afternoon of the 10 May raids against Scientology, Jan started spazzing at an Anon who was casually strolling with an [[OG]] past the "org." The anti-Scilons [[Kung fu|jeet-kune-doh]]'d the guy's negative thetan-vibes and diverted the fight. A short time later, though, Jan wanted to argue with the un-brainwashed ex-Scilon. The OG told him what Hubbard used to say about Indonesians and other [[Philippines|half-monkey races]]. Suddenly, Jan tried to rip the OG's shirt off, and would have punched him in the face but once again, Anonymous aikido'd the Scilon's bad energies and he went stumbling to the ground. Then the OG snapped a picture of him.
