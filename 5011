==Background==
At some point in the [[Youtube furry war|YouTube Furry War]], WWWWHAT43 (trolling alt of [[User:FrizzleFry101|FrizzleFry101]]), trolled a furry known as TheLionKingLipsync, a [[furfag]] in Quebec, [[Canada]], his reaction was to try to mimic WWWWHAT43's page, and attempt to [[troll]] the other trolls by [[Asking for it|acting like a moron and threatening to kill people]]. 

'''Lulz_in_hell_Trollfags''', or LIHTF for short, [[Powerword|real name]]; '''Pierre-Luc Potvin''', made a [[YouTube]] video of an [[angsty]] [[victim]] of [[fursecution]] firing a gun into the head of an alleged troll while a large cat face overlooks with a swastika on his head. It is so ridiculous and over the top that most people who see it will think that it's a joke made to make furries look even more retarded than they already are. Whether or not he actually [[internet tough guy|walks his walk]] is yet to be seen. If he does, he'll go to jail and get butt-raped (public threats on the internet make it a little harder to get away with the lulzy act of [[murder]]). On the other hand, if he doesn't back his shit up, he'll look like a [[bitch]]. Either way, furries lose!

WWWWHAT43 gave LIHTF the phone number of another furry as his own, LIHTF has been calling this number, unknowingly screaming at another [[furfag]], until he closed his account.

Interestingly enough, as a french Canadian, LIHTF would have a VERY difficult time obtaining anything to actually carry his threat out WITH. Merely OWNING a handgun without the proper registration in his country is a serious pound-you-in-the-ass prison offense, and those registration records are indeed public. Many [[lulz]] are to be had to the first [[troll]] to obtain any record of him owning a firearm or lack thereof; if he does not have one, his bluff will have been called out for the shit that it is, and if he does, his threatening images with the a firearm AS a firearms owner will earn him a quick visit from the RCMP [[party van]] courtesy of ED. As before, either way, the furries lose! <s>[http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/contact/default_e.asp GO FOR IT! CALL OUT HIS SHIT!] Make sure to mention his threatening videos, since he's so bad ass and all he won't care. He can handle the RCMP. He's just that fucking awesome, obviously.</s> TOO LATE!!!!

Recently, '''Pierre-Luc Potvin''''s account was closed, as per his description of it on his WikiFur page (see external links at the bottom), for '''racist content'''. Yes, that's right, the person who tried to avoid persecution of furries in turn persecuted others, thus proving furries are the number one group least deserving of [[masturbation|life]]. He seems to be [[an hero|doing all right]].

"''Fact: ''Finally, Trollfags are just [[furries|people who are really bored and need attention. Because they have no goals/passions in their life...'']] ''Most of the time, it end in a collective [[an hero|suicide]] around 30-35 years old. Sadly... we have to wait, ... Or... Kill some at [[Lulzcon]] ;)"''

==His lulzy video (LULZ IN HELL TROLLFAGS 2/1,000)==

Here's his terrifying death threat! <s>VIDEO NOT AVAILABLE</s> re-uploaded by a fellow fur-hater.

==Prank call==
LIHTF tries to [[prank call]] someone, but fails at getting a lulzy reaction. He speaks in [[French]] Canadian (French's equivalent of redneck English)through the whole thing, which causes the English-speaking "troll" to hang up. LIHTF sees this as a [[victory]] claiming that "[[Bullshit|Trolls are too scared to talk to me!]]". What makes LIHTF's failure worse is that even if the "troll" understood French he probably wouldn't have understood his shitty dialect.

==Rebuttal video==
<s>Here, LIHTF shows the world how "butt hurt" the trolls are by showing that they mentioned him on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. The quality of the video is kinda shitty so you can't tell what's going on. However, he sure did show [[ebaumsworld|those trolls]]!!!</s> ([[baleet|baleeted]])
