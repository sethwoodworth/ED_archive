About 40-50 people showed up, unfortunately [[Bitch|Hilary Clinton]] was in town and marched in the St. Patrick's Day parade, so there were minimal news reports.

<br><br>Few scientologists were outside. Most were having trouble with their camera equipment. One was stuck on the stoop to the "office of scientology" running a handheld camcorder through a cord attached to the wall inside immediately prompting Anonymous to chant "stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop."

Regular searches were done by anon to spook any Scilons out of alley ways to ensure Anon would return home with a less likelihood of being followed. These "searches" were referred to as "Penis Patrols" by several anons. A local FOX affiliate was filming as well (apparently).

The Party Hard party playlist was played by an Anonymous (nicknamed Boombox Man or Devo Man) holding a boombox with a Devo hat. 

<BR><BR><center><youtube>VdAJl8I2xNI</youtube></center><BR><BR>

Roughly 280 people were there.
New memes were born. Horns were honked. Party hats were worn, and deliciously moist cake was nommed.

One retarded Anon broke city ordinances when he stood out of a car's passenger window while approaching the intersection. Police stopped the car at the intersection to tell him to settle down. The driver was not masked. At the red light the driver leaned on their horn until the light changed, and the police pulled them over. Scilons took pictures, a carpenter's mask was given to her for some protection. Consensus was the tards deserved it.  The license plates were photographed by scifags, with <strike>sexy</strike> Fair Game results.<BR>

Turnout wasn't as strong this time, however threats of 90 percent chance of rain, the duration of the protest, and Anons from the first protest assuming more people would go this time and thus not turning out all were likely contributing factors.

Note: The Church of Scientology is apparently moving their offices elsewhere in the City of Boston later in 2008.

http://digg.com/odd_stuff/Video_of_Riot_Police_Arresting_Anonymous_Leader_in_Atlanta

ATLANTA RIOT POLICE ARREST PEACEFUL PROTESTERS, THE VIDEO IS NOT TO BE DIRECTLY LINKED TO, FOLLOW THE LINK AND DIGG IT MUTHAFUCKA.

Epic fail was delivered by the Dekalb County Police Department (not the Sheriff's Department).  Two Anonymous were taken away after delivering speeches and starting chants from a bullhorn.  They were arrested and a paypal account is planned to collect money to help them with bail (and possible lawyer's fees if the charges stick) as well as paying off tickets of people cited for horn honking.  The charges are protesting without a permit (which is horseshit because they were the ones who told us we didn't need a permit) and "creating an unsafe situation," which basically can be applied to any person at any time if the police feel a need to arrest you. Current speculation is that the police officers are linked to the cult, as in may be being bribed, have connections to them (contacts: family, friends, etc.), or may be scifags themselves. This is feeling like the Co$'s SnowWhite all over again; it's a possibility that they are infiltrating again, but through the conversion of the common people. Be cautious in this are, it seems we may see further trouble.

Police continued to fail by pulling over anyone who dared honk their horn for some bullshit like improper use of automobile equipment.  They also were pulled over for driving past us several times or slowing down to read our signs.  IT R ILLEGAL TO HEAR WHAT ANONYMOUS HAS TO SAY!!1 :(

I didn't get an accurate count of the people there, I was nowhere near the halfway mark when I hit 42 so I'm assuming we had 100-150.

Questions that need to be addressed in arrest

# If they didn't know there was a protest why did they bring out the riot squad?
# Mask are sign of expression. Do they violate 1st amendment rights? Why are the riot police allowed to wear masks? 

As of 3:00 Monday, 17 March, the Dekalb County PD public information officer swears up and down that nobody was arrested. lol wut? And now the Dekalb PD are claiming that the megaphone anons were "stepping in and out" of the road, and that the honkers were "cruising." Bullshit/ass coverage, amirite?

'''NJANON EYEWITNESS REPORT'''

RLJ saw a completely different raid than I did. I showed up at Bryant Park at 9:00 AM.  Our marcabian invasion forces numbered between 100-150, when we headed out. Overall, We supassed our previous showing by at least 100, and we were far more sharp and on-message than on 2/10.  It was a fucking epic win, with well over 300 showing up- the only thing missing was Chris Hansen, asking the scifags to have a seat, right over there.

'''RLJ EYEWITNESS REPORT'''
[[Image:Scientology315.jpg|thumb|Protestors in front of 227 West 46th Street, Manhattan, 3/15/08]]
I arrived at the COS facility on 227 West 46th Street in Manhattan between Broadway and 8th Avenue prior to the start of the protest.  I took some basic precautions, leaving my dox at home and putting my cash in one of my shoes.  This was to prevent identity theft due to the risk of pickpocketing.  In a crowd it is simple to steal someone's wallet and run away before the victim can react.

When I arrived, I saw twenty to thirty New York City police offices standing in front of the COS facility along with two men who may have been COS.  A small corral of fencing had been set up partly on the sidewalk, partly in the street, and this was where the protest was to occur.  I saw one man wearing a guy fawkes mask waiting for the protest.  However, as will be seen, the wearing of masks on the face in public, being illegal in New York, caused problems for Anonymous.

At this point, I left the scene to get a disposable camera, since I realized I would be a failfag unless I got pictures.  I haven't developed them yet, will upload when I do.

Anyway, when I got back the "corral" was full of protesters holding green balloons, sarcastically singing happy birthday to L. Ron Hubbard.  The balloons were emblazoned with an anon-headless suit logo.

A police officer then told me I couldn't stand on the sidewalk and had to move so I walked up and down the block.  The police were also enforcing the mask law, forcing chanology to wear their masks on the backs of their heads.  They were prepared for this, having smaller dust masks that the police apparently had to let them wear.  They chanted "Don't drink the Kool Aid" and "Free Xenu" and held up signs with similar slogans, information and website addresses.

Most New Yorkers passing by the protest were bemused or annoyed by the spectacle.  Some took photographs of each other in front of the protest.

I was given a flower by one of the protesters, in recognition of a person who was allegedly denied anti-psychotic medication due to scientology beliefs regarding psychiatric treatment, and who killed someone because of this.  See [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/JeremyPerkins/ this]

Some of the other chants included "Dangerous Cult," "Over 9000," and "Save your money, Save yourself"

A police officer, who saw me walking back and forth and writing, asked me what I was writing.  I said "for my website."  I didn't want to explain encyclopedia dramatica for obvious reasons.  This was the first time a police officer had spoken to me in many years.

By around 11:20 am the protest had lost some steam in terms of numbers.  There were perhaps 80 or so protesters at this time.

Sadly, I had to leave due to a prior conflict, but not before I witnessed the police requiring anon to remove their mask due to the law and a menacing looking older man in a leather jacket who stood outside of the COS building and watched the protest.  I got some photos of him.  He's pretty intimidating!


-----
please NOTE: ANONS from Jersey arriving first @ 46st didn't notice any "loss of steam" in fact having stayed for the whole thing and some, we noted it GREW HUGE.  When we arrived a little after 11 60-80 people where there.. an hour later we where around 150 to 200.. (hey some travelers didnt want to get up at 6am- We were dedicated) at 12:30-1pm it peaked at the 450 mark when random people (mostly collage kids) decided to grab a mask or make a sign and join in- the long cat was long- and the cake was a lie at this point but the doughnuts were a surprise..

at 2pm or so after thanking police and cleaning Anonymous was on such a high they declared an AFTER PARTY
BECAUSE WE PARTY HAAAARRRDD, and decided to pay a visit to the nice people at the celebrity center some where on 82nd st
(40+ blocks away)  with noise permit in hand we chanted, declared, sang, danced and YES we DID finally EAT CAKE! 
we had 150 people apox on this site and a suspect "scifag" in the group who was a "journalist" posing questions like "Why do feel compelled to prosecute this religion and not other religions?" or "how do you justify these hate crimes"  we all politely responed and alienated him.. (no pun intended)

over all HUGE EPIC WINFEST

<br>
Most excellent win was attained by the /b/uffatards and /r/ochanons.  Around 12:40 or so we peaked at about 60 people including a few ex-scis.  Much fun, cake, and pizza was enjoyed by all.  Several videos are destined for youtube.  Only a few incidents were had with local law, but some random crackhead and a Catholic guy out for a walk joined our merry band of reprobates and /r/einforcements from local colleges rolled in all day long.

However, at approximately 3:24, either some idiot local cops who thought we needed a permit or a Co$ spai dressed as a cop demanded to see our permits, and we were forced to disperse, since we had been assured that we didn't need one.

.

<br>
Cops were neutral to positive and turnout was good, around 75 people. <br><br> Channel News 9 came out as well as a correspondant from a local high school and SUNY Albany, the latter of which we may make the front page for. Overall win (though nothing epic) even though we were prevented from doing most anything but chanting and holding signs (no bull horns, restricted space for standing, no boom boxes, etc.). Local Scifag came out and and took all our pictures, we finally got his attention after mentioning things like how the bridge was free and we were not opposing the religion nor the members (apparently this is news to scifags) and got him talking some (though very little, which his supervisor seemed to have a bitch fit about and yell at him about it when he returned inside).  This seems to indicate that the seeds planted on the 10th are starting to take root. <br> <br>Passing traffic response was beyond expectations, likely meaning people are starting to listen and research some, although experiences seemingly indicate that the majority of the public is still unaware and we need to bump up awareness efforts globally. Protest ended at 3:00 PM with wonderful rendition of Queen's "We are the Champions." Photos and video can be found at [http://www.albanyanon.com]. <center>Global speech. Anonymous needs a less slippery scarf!</center>

===<br><br><center><big><big><big><big>'''Farmington Hills, MI'''</big></big></big></big></center>===
<br><br>


The Farmington Hills raid increased vastly in number since the weather was much nicer the Febuary 10th AKA " Operation Frostbite". The numbers keep growing at a steady pace from 1:30pm till around 5:30pm at its peak head count numbers reached between 150-200 people. The police were for the most part very civil with us and basically told us to just to stay out of the street and not hand out fliers to cars. There were many treats such as delicious cake, including one made of penis and win. Even The King stopped by, with a sack full of burgers. All in all it was a good time and we had quite a bit of traffic support, up to and including a couple of drive-by high fives. We can only hope for an even better turn out in April when the weather get a bit more above freezing.

# A good crowd video plus The Wave.
# Michigan did infact party hard!

Epic weather fail again, and everyone around here is sick right now. But at least we're growing and reached 9 Anons on 3.15.08. A good friend of the mother of Noah Lottick stopped and spoke to us. She told us how hard of a time
Noah's family had trying to get straight answers from the Co$ about the events that lead 
up to his death. She also said how glad she was we're out there doing this:) Local Pd was very cool, lots of HONKS from passing cars for our 'honk if you think $cientology is a scam' sign. Windy, cold and wet but it was still fun with some singing and dancing and the occasional Rickroll. April's will be bigger!

===<center><big><big><big><big>'''San Juan, Puerto Rico'''</big></big></big></big></center>===
<br><br>
It all started when there was supposed to be a march until we got to the "church" but unfortunately only three anons showed up so we just went there. The only '''epic''' fail is that we didn't get video of the scifag approaching us. The thing is that when we got there we were holding up our picket signs and passing out flyers/dvds. Then suddenly we see this guy unsuspectingly walk behind us, so an anon went up to him and offered him a flyer but he refused it. 
About 10 mins. later we see the same guy and some lady walking towards us.. obviosly they both were scifags. So she starts asking; "Why are you wearing masks?, I'm not wearing one." We give her the answer. So an anon asks her "Who are you?" and she responds "A citizen". So then he asked "From where?" ... she responds "Puerto Rico"
Umm.. what was the point of that. Honestly her lips were shaking.. lulz, she was scared of us..!
At the end she asks for a flyer, we gave her one and she leaves, but it was obvious she was going to call the police. So anon quickly packed up (btw all the flyers were given out when we left, she got the last one!!) and left.
Anyways an anon from Puerto Rico has been contacted to be intervied by the media [http://www.wapa.tv WAPA] So we'll see how that goes.
