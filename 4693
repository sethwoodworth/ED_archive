LJ user
Someone who uses [[LiveJournal]], identifiable by the little icon of a featureless white man wearing a blue shirt that appears before their screen-names ({{lj|user=example}}). Most, if not all, '''LJ users''' (also known as '''LiveJournalers''' and '''LJers''') are [[16_year_old_girls | sixteen year-old girls]], [[bears]], [[homosexuals]], [[Angsty teen | angst-ridden teens]], [[Sick fuck | sexual deviants]], [[Basement-dweller | basement-dwelling]] [[nerd]]s, [[cosplay]]ers and [[attention]]-seeking societal degenerates. 

The [[:Category: LJ Users| LJ Users Category]] contains a decent-sized list of certain (in)famous LJers.
