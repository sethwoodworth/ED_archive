'''Chuggo''' is a [[Canadian]] [[rap]]per who is often called a [[wigger]] for no reason other than he's a white guy who talks like a [[black person]]. However, [[some argue]] that Chuggo is not, in fact, a wigger, but an intelligent human being who likes to [[gay|fuck guys]]. The Canadianicity in his blood forces Chuggo to become [[Rage|enraged]] about the fact that he is not part of a [[America|better country]]. This forces Chuggo to show his [[hate]] through the easiest form known to man, that being to take a beat, talk some words, and [[????|hey presto]], you got [[Oxymoron|a rap song]]. However, because no one actually pays attention to what Canadians have to say, [[Fail|this is an ill fated attempt at seriousness]]. Some myths are spoken about Chuggo, some of which are [[Bullshit|preposterous]], but some true, such as the mayonnaise [[conspiracy]].


== Background ==
[[Image:ChuggoGF.jpg|thumb|right|Chuggo and his [[fleshlight|girlfriend]]]]
Chuggo grew up on Lakeshore & Islington in Toronto. This shows that he's clearly [[Internet tough guy|street]]. He was raised between a [[KFC]] and a [[GNAA]] owned strip club where he was [[rape|taught]] to love [[Cum|mayonnaise]]. Because of this, he is a terribly confused individual who can't decide if he's a [[wigger]] or AHHH CMON FUCK A GUY.

For the first 7 years of his life, his head grew bigger due to a lot of T.V.-dinners covered in [[Cum|mayonnaise]] and drinking Remy Martin, this is probably why he AHHH CMON FUCK A GUY. 

In 2005 Chuggo was featured as a wanted top 10 criminal on the 222-tips website. He surrendered to the police soon after his name appeared on the list. He was later acquitted when it became clear it was a case of mistaken identity as he was already in jail for AHHH CMON FUCK A GUY when the crimes were committed.

Chuggo has a [[MySpace]] page, but is unable to update it because he is a [[Canadian]] [[rap]]per who therefore can't afford a [[computer]] to keep his shit AHHH CMON FUCK A GUY.

==Mayonnaise ('mayonaisse' in Chuggese) ==
[[Image:Chuggomayo.gif|thumb|right|Chuggo eats mayo, always]]
{{quote|I put mayonaisse on everything, that's how I eat.| Chuggo}}

As stated previously, the widely believed reason for Chuggo putting mayonnaise on everything, is the fact that he states, in his own words, that he grew up beside a KFC and a gay strip club. However, [[retards|analysts]] have shown that the most obvious [[Bisexual|by]]-product of this would be him putting chicken up his ass, but he has never mentioned, or at least, has never been documented as having mentioned whether or not he has done so.

Another reason though, greatly increasing the reason why Chuggo actually puts mayonnaise on everything, is that he was in fact a mayonnaise trafficker for the gay strip club. Everyone knows that gay people use mayonnaise as lubricant, and many believe that Chuggo was employed to acquire mayo from the KFC and transport it to the gay club. This caused him psychosomatic stress, and as a result, Chuggo now has to have mayonnaise on everything, literally. This theory would also explain his immortal line 

Another theory is also being [[Goatse|spread]] as of this time, that being that Chuggo just likes the taste of [[Cum|mayonnaise]]. This theory however, has been shot down by nearly everyone, as there is no proof of it.

Though Chuggo has claimed he puts mayonnaise on "everything," it is unknown whether he actually likes the taste of mayonnaise or if he just eats it to get a rep. In the video "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fewSqea4CCs Chuggo Eats]", he can be seen preparing "his favorite dish," which is clearly pork and beans. Critics of Chuggo have taken this as proof of the fraudulence of Chuggo's professed mayonnaise affinity; his defenders point out that a jar of Miracle Whip can be clearly seen after seven seconds of the video, and that the preparation of Chuggo's meal is not shown in full.  These defenders are undoubtedly retarded, as Miracle Whip is not [[cum|mayonnaise]], but [[piss|mayonnaise substitute]].

===Chuggo Mayonnaise===
[[Image:ChuggoMayo.png|thumb|right|Possible advertisement for "Chuggo Mayonaisse"]]
Chuggo is soon to be releasing his own brand of mayonnaise, called "Chuggo Mayonaisse" ([[sic]]) with the tagline being: "It's [[Santorum|Chugg-O-Riffic]]!". A glimpse of this new product is given in his "AHHH, CMON FUCK A GUY" video, as well as the possible advertising promotion for the product. The applications of the product are as of yet, unknown.

== AHHHHH CMON FUCK A GUY ==

{{quote|AHHHH! C'MON FUCK A GUY! Fuckin' with me, you must really want to die.| Chuggo, admitting he has [[AIDS]]}}

Chuggo's first and only music video is a gorgeous high school video-editing class [[fail|winner]], featuring amazing green screening and awesome graphics.

In the song, he bravely embraces every man's natural urges to [[Buttsecks|AHHHH! CMON FUCK A GUY]].

It is now the most popular song in [[Canadia]], because Canadafags were tired of listening to rap songs that could actually vaguely pass as music like [[shit no one cares about|Buck 65 and Atach Tatuq]]

Chuggo, since being declared an honorary [[Penis Pump]]er, has since been covered by some of the pumpers themselves, to awesome affect. Different genres have been experimented with, with some [[Lol|lulz-worthy]] results produced. See the below videos for sheer awesomeness and [[lulz]].

== Chuggo interview by Penis Pump ==

{{quote|I went on youtube, it says P P T V, Penis Pumper| Chuggo}}

On 26th of March, 2008, one fine unknown pumper plucked up the courage and telephoned Chuggo. This was done as an attempt to ascertain whether or not Chuggo has seen/heard the remixes of his song "AHHH CMON FUCK A GUY!", and if so, what Chuggo himself thought about the current Chuggers made by the [[Penis Pump]]ers. The call was also made to gauge what Chuggo's opinions were on certain aspects of what is being said about him on the [[internets]].

===Chuggolation===

His curiosity about what [[Penis Pump]] is, was also mentioned, aswell as his inability to use computers.

Chuggo: so i dont um, you know, like, i fail sending emails, everytime i ask someone if they got an email, they say no<br>

===A Message===

In the last moments of the call to Chuggo, the pumper asks if Chuggo would like to send the pumpers a message.

Pumper: so if i had to relay a message, um, you know, if i had to relay a message word for word, what would you want to say to the penis pumpers<br>
Chuggo: whatever you hear, if you hear it like that i dont care as long as your hearing it and enjoy it<br>
