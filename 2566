[[Image:Connectionproblem.png|thumb|Occasional message you will get after a while of playing.]]

[[Image:ZzZzzz.jpeg|thumb|FUCK YES! THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!]]

[[Image:Fanfest_2007_TROLLED.jpg|thumb|OK, CCP. You win.]]
'''''[http://www.eveonline.com/ EVE Online]''''' is an extremely slow and boring [[MMORPG]] that hardly anyone plays, made by the greasy [[Iceland|foreigners]] at Crowd Control Productions, or CCP. Many consider the game to be an interactive screensaver at times. The crowd that plays the game is made up of the [[basement dweller|usual]] [[jews|suspects]]. One of the only reasons why people actually try this game out is because of the [[Cp|awesome graphics]]. According to the makers of the game, [[Lie|the players have a lot of freedom of what they choose to do in the game]]. This freedom that they speak of is mining ore in order to make [[money|Jew gold]] or [[Troll|grief]] other players to make their lives living hells. There is no point to this game except to waste your worthless life away and make yourself a [[Loser|pariah]] to the outside world.

''EVE Online'' [[Elitist|players]] do not take kindly to WoW players or any other [[Losers|MMORPG players]] because ''EVE'' is [[Lie|more 1337 than any other MMORPG]]. Their minds need to be cleansed of this faggotry, and they need understand the irony of what they are saying.

The players are also known to own [[Blockatiel|cockatiels]].

{{squote|The bottom line is that ''EVE'' is a [[Fucktarded|rich and immersive]] universe centered on [[basement dweller|human]] interaction. Players can play the game as a simple space trader or endeavor to control the largest, most powerful company in the universe. We provide the [[Shit|rules and tools]], but [[Lie|it is the players themselves who create the adventures.]]|Description of ''EVE Online'' on the [[Crap|official website]].}}

{{quote|Eve Online is a race to see who can be the biggest Jew in space.|[[tl;dr|translation]]}}

=="Gameplay"==
First of all, to play this game you're going to need to be a Jew, have a degree in Business and Finance and finally have a [[dick]] shorter than 3". The gameplay of ''EVE'' - if you could call it that - usually consists of [[Microsoft|right clicking and selecting an option from a dropdown menu]] (when in [[space]], at least.) As mentioned above, the developers give the players the stuff to use, and watch as the players use said [[crap]] any way they like in the game. This is called a [[sandbox]] game. Like an [[irl]] sandbox, you can crush that [[USI|braggart]] of a kid's over-the-top sandcastle within two seconds, kick sand in the little shit's eyes, and pour sand [[Lol|down his shorts]]. Unlike an [[irl]] sandbox, [[you]] can get away with it in ''EVE''.

However, before you get to do all that stuff, you must pass...

===The Wonderful Learning Curve===
The [[Idiots|creators]] of ''EVE Online'' thought the game would be easy to learn with the tutorials and help chats that they put into the game (such as "Rookie Help" that is [[Spam|spamtastic]]). Instead, they fucked themselves over with these ideas. As you can see by this graph that is shown here, people have trouble getting over the [[Retardation|learning curve]] of this game.

<center>{{frame|[[Image:LearningCurve.jpg]]|color=#CCDADC}}</center>

<center>Few have survived the learning curve; those who did have [[No Life|no lives]] <b>AT ALL</b>.</center>

===Skill Training===
This is why the game is considered so [[boring]]. To level up your skills, such as [[Psychology|spatial awareness]] or [[Vidya|hand-eye coordination]], you purchase a textbook of the skill from someone somewhere, and add it to your training queue. Then you wait as it trains over time, like a [[torrent]]. Essentially, '''you can level up in ''EVE'' without even logging in'''.

==Races==
''EVE Online'' has four races: the Gallente, the Amarr, the Minmatar, and the Caldari:

* The '''Gallente''' are a bunch of peace-loving [[French]] and [[Chinese]] [[hippies]] who somehow are playable in a game that revolves much around griefing people and blowing shit up. Instead of fighting, they use robot drones to attack for them. They believe since the drones do all the work, [[Technical virgin|they're still peace-lovers]]. [[No|Riiightt...]] All their ships have extremely dick shaped designs, who would of guessed?

* The '''Amarr''' are zealous [[Catholic]]s (no, fucking [http://www.eveonline.com/races/amarr_timeline.asp seriously]) that dislike anyone who doesn't [[Fundamentalist|think the same way]]. They start crusades with [[lazer|lazers]] and probably wish they [[holocaust]]'d the Minmatar by now.

* The '''Caldari''' are the [[Jews]] (but oddly enough they are the most Nazi like race of the game). They own all the major corporations and every Caldari is born into one.  If they [[Flounce|quit]], they will be complete pariahs and considered dead. You know, Jewish. Somehow, they're allied with the Amarr. They are also terrible at player-versus-player because, as mentioned, they're more concerned with rigging the prices of [[fucking everything]].

* The '''Minmatar''' are all [[Viking|Scandinavian]] black person. They used to pick space-cotton for the Amarr until Space-Lincoln set them free, allowing the Minmatar to build their own ships made out of [[Bike|stolen bikes and TVs]]. Their ships are fast as a result but will immediately explode if they touch as much as a space-pebble. The Gallente also use them to process [[chicken|space-chikunz]]. They're still not completely free and just like their real life counter parts never will be, and would have been better off under the protection of their [[white|superior masters]].

===Other "Important" Factions and Characters===
[[Image:Guristas.png|thumb|80px|right|The Guristas logo.]]
These factions are more like corporations created by the developers. They are incredibly ridiculous and seem like leftovers from ''[[Star Trek]]''.

* The '''Serpentis''' are a league of [[Cocaine|crackhead]] non-player characters that make space drug outlets. One can assume they're not too bright, as their cargo containers all say "<font size=3 color=#0073DE>NARCOTICS</font>" in bright blue lettering on the side.

* The '''Guristas''' are a pirate faction created by two [[goth]] NPCs after they decided to stop being a bunch of [[kikes]] (being Caldari) and spend their lives blowing shit up, stealing things, and [[troll]]ing the Caldari Navy. Their logo is so totally [[Hot Topic]] - a skull with [[Playboy|rabbit]] ears. Because of how [[unfunny|wacky]] and [[fag|trendy]] the logo is, the Guristas [http://store.eve-online.com/Guristas-Hooded-Sweatshirt-P95.aspx hooded sweatshirt] is the best-selling item from the ''EVE Online'' store. When CCP sells out to [[Hot Topic]] in 2012, you will see [[scene]] kids with that logo everywhere. Remember, you heard it [[ED|here]] first!

* The '''Jovians''' are a race of fucktarded [[alien]]s  that keep [[BME|modifying themselves]] to be [[Aryan|the most superior of all races]]. Unfortunately for them, it kills them off before they hit [[I'm 12 years old and what is this?|twelve years old]]. Hopefully they will all [[self-pwn]] in time.

* '''[[Cops|CONCORD]]''' [[Shit nobody cares about|(Consolidated Cooperation and Relations Command)]] are the space cops. If you attack someone in a high-security solar system, CONCORD will commit [[police brutality]].
<br>

==Corporations and Alliances==
[[Image:603corp.jpg|thumb|In reality, the jumps would be 40+ jumps and the [[rape]] tax rate would be over 30%.]]

Corporations are scams that make the players think that they are involved in something useful in ''EVE Online''. In reality, corporations are just full of people that [[Masturbate|dick around]] and enslave players for their own ventures. When someone asks what the money or resources are used for, the [[The Man|higher ups]] will usually say that it is for ships or some bullshit in order to [[Lie|help out everyone]]. This is a lie considering the fact that they are [[Jews|buying the ships for themselves]]. In conclusion, corporations are a great scam in order for [[the man]] to rip off the mere peasants in ''EVE Online'' just like in real life!

===Goonfleet vs. Band of Brothers===
''[[Goon Squad|Goonfleet]]'' is probably the most famous corporation ("guild" in [[WoW|lay]][[EQ|man]]'s terms) because of its high amount of [[Asperger's syndrome]]. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbfBjo-Mw6U Visual evidence is provided here]. ''EVE Online'' is the only game where [[Goons]] think they are [[Uber|supreme]]. This was set in stone in early [[2009]] when a BoB director switched sides and disbanded the BoB Alliance. [http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/57098 ever since Goons try to claim Credit for it.] As they claim credit for the invasion of the former BoB held space - which infact was done by Goons' allies, while Goons where not taking part in the fights. But who fucking cares?:

<center><gallery>
Image:Band_of_brothers_before.png|Before the [[shitstorm]]...
Image:Band_of_brothers_after.png|MOTHERFUCKING [[Pwnt|OWNED]]!
</gallery></center>

<s>It is important to note that [[Goon Squad]] had the same exact thing happen to them in ''[[EverQuest II]]'' as [http://www.eq2flames.com/unrest/45009-what-happened.html seen here], further proving that Goons suck at every MMORPG including ''EVE'' just the EVE-Goons tend to have a distorted view of reality.</s> Part of Goon reformed, but can't defend themselves anymore and are being completely torn apart by pretty much everyone.

==Wormholes==
[[Image:Eve_blowjob.jpg|thumb|left|[[Blowjob|Blowjorbs?]]]]
[[Image:Hello.jpg|thumb|A [[Goatse|wormhole]]]]
[[Image:Capsuleer_Emerges_WIP_by_Aeonicentity.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rule 34]] is a typical result of wormholes.]]
After the ''Apocrypha'' expansion was released, wormholes (aka Dramaholes or [[assholes]] for ship [[buttsecks]]) were incorporated into the game. These wormholes allow players to go into uncharted space where they are able to make tons of money and get items to create [[Crap|Strategic Cruisers]]. These wormholes are unstable though which means that they can collapse at any of time. Therefore, one can easily get stuck in the uncharted space. If they do not have scanners, they will not be able to find their way out and will have to resort to [[suicide]]. Many people were eager to jump into the wormholes to make money. Fortunately, the wormholes closed on some people which created massive [[Baw|drama]] throughout many ''EVE'' forums. This drama was entertaining though considering the fact that the people knew that there was a risk of the wormholes closing up.

{{squote|I'm currently stuck in a wormhole (took one for the team, yeah go me.) This isn't a [[Butthurt|gripe or a moan]] about that, i'm fine with it, but is there no relatively quick way to find a wormhole amongst all the other signatures? I've ended up scanning down 12 signatures now, and none of them have been wormholes. I appreciate you don't want it to be easy, but this is just getting a [[Gay|little silly]]. Does anyone have any hints or tips on how to judge if a sig will be a wormhole without having to scan it to [[lol|30%]]?|[[Whine|Crying]] about how much of a pain in the ass it is to get out of a wormhole.}}

{{squote|[[Suicide|self destruct]] is your friend|Response to [[baw]]}}
<br><br>

==Strategic Cruisers==
[[Image:Scruiser.jpg|thumb|[[You]] will never have this.]]
Strategic Cruisers (or [[Shit|Tech III ships]]) are basically shitty barebone ships which are heavily modifiable. The developers thought that this would be a great idea since it makes people want to go into wormholes and allow people have fun customizing their ships. The trouble is that NO ONE HAS THEM and no one is willing to sell them on the market since they are [[No|super awesome]]. Keep dreaming because you will never have this ship.
<br><br>
And even if you did, [[Goons|some punks]] would trick you into fighting them and steal it anyway.
<br><br>

==Chats==
[[Image:TheJEW.png|thumb|right|An accurate depiction of a person who plays ''EVE Online''.]]
There are multiple chats in the [[Nerd|universe of ''EVE'']] each of which have their own little spice to them.

*<i>Local Chat</i> - No one uses this chat. If you talk in it in low sec, you are either a fucking retard or you are ready to own someone. If someone else does, it's usually a "[[Asshole|friendly]]" hello which should be taken as a warning that the person will eventually fuck you up later on in the area that you are in.

*<i>Rookie Chat</i> - [[Spam]] central. Full of Chinese farmers advertising Jew. People that buy money are [[Noobs|suckers]].

*<i>Help Chat</i> - When a player enters this chat, they are greeted with a friendly message saying that there are no admins in the chat that will help at all. Asking for help is really stupid in this chat considering the fact that half of the chatters are either trolls or noobs that cannot answer a simple question.

*<i> Corp chat </i> - If you are the unfortunate breed of anti-social and you actually join a [[circle jerk|player run corporations]] this is where you will spend most of the rest of your life.
 
*<i> Fleet Chat</i> - Where you and your most lonely corp mates wax each others [[dongs|ships]].

===Emoticons===
''EVE'' players, for [[Nobody cares|whatever reason]], prefer their own emoticons that sometimes end up in [[Nobody cares|other corners of the Internet]], but are much more prevalent ingame. Here is a glossary.

*'''o/''' = [[Hitler|Sieg Heil]]

*'''o7''' = Salute

*'''\o/''' = [[USI|I'm Awesome]]

*'''~o~''' = Pippi Longstocking

==EVEMon==
[[Image:EVE_cosplay.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cosplay]] as a [[French|Gallente]].]]

EVEMon is known to be one of the greatest add-ons for ''EVE''. It monitors your character's status and skills so that the player does not have to go into the game and check up on their character. Fortunately a lot of drama was produced from this add-on. Many noobs among ''EVE'' forums say that the program has malware included in it, but what the retards do not understand is that [[Norton|NORTON IS SHIT]].

{{quote|This isn't the first time we've had a false positive. You're welcome to compile it yourself, if you don't trust us.|[[Hurr|Hurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr]]}}

{{quote|Kaspersky rocks!

Back in the day, Mcafee, Norton, etc were really good, but they just don't compete as they used too.

They aren't bad, not at all, but especially for the prices, they could be alot better.|[[Fucktard]]}}

==''EVE'' Tournaments of 2009==
[[Image:Gallente_Maternity_Wear_by_Kazuv.jpg|thumb|A female Gallente drawn by a [[pregnophile]].]]
On February 7th and 8th a group of [[Nerd|nerds]] finally came together and formed a competition that was broadcast live. During this competition, all of the biggest corporations fought to get virtually nothing. The tournament was lulzy though due to the fact that the ships of the players who had [[Lulz|worked very hard to get them all blew up in the end]]. The narrators tried to make the competition a big deal as this was happening but failed to do so.

==Forums==
The official ''EVE Online'' forums are a shithole of [[trolling]], [[butthurt]], counter-trolling, counter-counter trolling and [[faggotry]], particularly in CAOD (Corporations, Alliances and Organisation discussion, which can best be described ad the forums' equivalent of [[b/|/b/]] for the amount of trolling and drama it contains (but with a lack of [[goatse]]), and in ''EVE'' General Discussion, where the trolls who don't post in CAOD go, along with butthurt whiners complaining because they got killed or because a specific ship is overpowered because they can't fly it.

==Security==
There are multiple "solar systems" in ''EVE''. They are rank by their security rating though marking each one by how dangerous they are. This rating can range from 1.0 (safe) all the way down to 0.0 ([[Ghetto|shithole]]). The only good place to hang out in ''EVE'' is 0.4-0.0 though. Pirating, griefing, and wars go on here. Lulzy as it is, the actions committed in 0.4-0.0 create buckets full of drama.

==Quafe==
[[Image:Quafe.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Mtn Dew for EVEfags.]]
[[Queef|Quafe]] is THE hip and awesome energy drink in the world of ''EVE Online''. It was originally made by (surprisingly enough) some Gallente guys to alleviate stomachaches, but since the drink was so addictive or tasty or something, it became hugely popular within the universe. Nobody knows what exactly is in Quafe, but [[Some argue|some speculate]] it consists of [[Chris-chan|Fanta and semen]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCP_hf#Quafe CCP actually decided to make this drink IRL] - it tastes like Sprite, apparently. Drinking Quafe will get you laid <sub>in ''EVE Online''.</sub>
<br><br>
When mixed with the [[WoW]] Mountain Dew Gamer Fuel and the [[EQ]] champagne, [[divide by zero|the end of the world will occur]].
<br><br>

==The Ricdic Scandal==
[[Image:Ricdic.png|thumb|right|BBC reported THIS?!]]
In early July 2009, an [[Australian]] player called "Ric[[dick|dic]]" looted over 200 billion ISK (the game's currency) and sold it for the equivalent of [[British|£]]3,115. Apparently the Aussie paid his medical bills and house deposits. This obviously led to him being [[b&]]. For [[retarded|some reason]] this [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8132547.stm even made it to the BBC].

{{quote|Basically this character was one of the people who had been running EBank for a while. He took a bunch of (virtual) money out of the bank, and traded it away for real money,|Ned Coker, some ''EVE Online'' developer;}}

Space-economy is [[srs]].

==Walk-In Stations==
Scheduled to be added at the end of [[2009]], [http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/47959 walk-in stations] are basically ''[[Second Life]]'' and ''EVE Online'' combined. Except without, the, you know, [[furry]] [[yiff]] [[tentacle rape|tentacles]] and such. Since ''EVE'' is one of the few MMOs that don't require running around as an avatar in an open world, many diehards [[Baw|whined]] that the "game was turning into WoW." Of course, the game won't turn into WoW until it becomes so easy that even [[Zombaby]] could have played it. It, however, will go the way of ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]''. As in, '''WON'T HAPPEN'''.

Image:Eve_walk_in_4.jpg|[[DAT ASS]]</gallery></center>

==DUST 514==
'''''DUST 514''''' is going to be the [[MMO]][[FPS]] side-project of CCP. ''EVE'' fans either jerk off to it furiously or think it will [[BAW|ruin ''EVE'' forever]]. Either way it's been done before with ''[[SOE|PlanetSide]]'', which was lame (and still is), and this will be no different. Except the screaming 14 year-old pansy boys playing ''DUST'' will get to interact with the screaming 28 year-old autistic men playing ''EVE'', by going on missions for them. This can only lead to ''EVE'' players sending the ''DUST'' ones into deathtraps.

<center>{{frame|<youtube>jzVjggarRns</youtube>|color=#72BECC}}</center><br>

Essentially it's the ''[[Halo]]'' MMO.

==How to Troll/Grief==
[[Image:Eve_tattoo_wat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wat|You mean they actually get laid?!]]<br><sub>Look for the [[tattoo]]...</sub>]]
There are many ways to troll ''EVE'' players, even more than the techniques that are listed here. Here are some examples!

*[[Bump]] ships to piss miners and salvagers off. Bumping doesn't really have any effect, but damn does it rile them up!
*Flip cans and take the ore.
*[[basement dweller|Pay an extra $14.99 a month]] so you can have your own cloaked stealth bomber [[samefag|alt]] waiting to help you blow up the [[noob|noobs]] you just can flipped. 
*Mouth people off while staying in station. They can't come in and hurt you. While this may make you look like a [[Poland|coward]], you'll also get to see how much of an [[Internet tough guy]] people are in this game.
*Kill miners and haulers in low security solar systems, and loot all of their space rocks/space cocaine/space [[hookers]].
*Jettison something out of your cargo into space, label it something [[stupid]] like "[[Obvious|FREE SHIT COME TAKE IT]]" - some [[noob]] will eventually open it, leaving them open to attack by you.
*Mention [[WoW]] even briefly. Especially if you say you're from WoW. The ''EVE'' players will eviscerate you more than [[EQ]] players will, so be careful!
*Tell them how awesome ''[[Halo|DUST 514]]'' (the [[Xbox 360|con]][[PS3|sole]] [[MMO]][[FPS]] sister of ''EVE'') will be. Or, conversely, don't. Either way, you will find people screaming how ''DUST'' ruined everything, or how it will be the best fucking thing of all time.
*Ask how you can become a [[Star Wars|Jedi]].
*Remind any of the players how [[penis|phallic]] the ships look, and it makes them [[Not gay|closeted homosexuals]].
*Tell them that VNV Nation sucks.
