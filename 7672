Sonic Youth
__NOTOC__

Just like [[Christians]] need a [[God]], and [[whores]] need [[jizz]] clinging to their throats, the [[indiefucks]] need a leader to guide them to the highest levels of musical fucktardation. Enter '''Sonic [[oldfags|Youth]]''', the only thing more irritating than watching [[furries]] shove [[necrophilia|porcupine carcasses]] up their rotten [[asshole|shit canals]]. Their name comes from the combination of fellow [[indiefucks]] who only helped to make the [[music]] industry more painful for everyone.

==Titanium Expos√©==
One day in the early 80's, a [[dead|corpse]] named Kim Gordon and a [[Hipster]] [[douche]] named Thurston Moore were doing [[crack]] at the back of a [[rapist|children's community center]], and decided to form a band where everything was out of tune, because it made them more '[[boring|unique]]' and '[[indie]]'. They went through [[none|countless]] auditions to find bandmates, which was pretty easy, considering the density of [[pot|stoners]] back then. They eventually recruited 2 more [[hipster]] [[douche|douches]], and settled on the name Sonic Youth, to convince themselves that they weren't stoned 30somethings. At some point, Kim and Thurston started banging each other, got married, and had a horribly deformed [[crack|baby]] named 'Coco Haley Gordon Moore'. Ever since they had their abomination, they've been [[whore|whoring]] her out to the [[Hollywood|media]], forcing her to guest star on shit shows such as Gilmore Girls.
==Kissability==
Proving that [[LiveJournal|Music Magazines]] do as much drugs as the average homeless person, every Sonic Youth album has received at least an 8 or 9 out of 10. [[fail|Rolling Stone]] has been sucking their dick since '87, making it clear why they gave [[gay|Green Day's]] new album 9/10. They have [[9000|about 16]] albums, each one [[lie|extremely diverse and influential]].

==Wish Fulfillment==

On [[4th of July|July 4th]] 1999, early [[trolls]] (most likely [[SA]] [[Goons]]) [[raid|raided]] Sonic Youth's tour bus and stole all their guitars, hindering them from playing music (because you know, playing with a standard acoustic [[guitar]] is SO difficult). Shortly after this happened, Lee made a bitch post on [[Usenet]] (found [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.music.sonic-youth/browse_thread/thread/179488b9b5ee2331/7270ff8994e508c4 here]), threatening whoever stole their equipment, and other [[lol]] statements. Upon hearing about this, the SY fan base underwent a major split, half mourning the loss of their shitty, beaten up instruments, while the other half saying that they had it coming.

This led to the band being extremely [[emo|depressed]], and their following album to be bashed into oblivion by ego-inflated critics (see: [http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/21889-nyc-ghosts-flowers Pitchfork's lol 0.0 review]). Around this time, the SA Goons decided to sell all the guitars on [[eBay]], to make a massive profit. Ironically enough, SY bought back most of their guitars from them. It's likely they didn't file a [[lawsuit]] because they were far too hopped on [[drug|mushrooms]] at the time. After recovering their instruments, SY went back to making albums, and continued to be the envy of [[stoner|drug users]], [[hippies]] and [[indiefucks]] everywhere.

Two of their guitars later showed up in (gasp) worse condition than when they were stolen.

==Expressway to Yr. Skull==
ATTENTION SONIC YOUTH FANS - your [[gay|uber cool]] heroes decided to make themselves relevant and cool again by making an album for [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/43669-starbucks-to-release-sonic-youth-celebrity-compilation/ Starbucks]the [[pretentious]] sell out corporate little [[whores]], but lets face it, Kim Gordon might as well be a whore (TOO LATE, SHE ALREADY IS)~ BILLY MAYS, she looks like she's been selling her pooper for [[jenkem]] since she was spewed out of her mothers [[cunt]].
