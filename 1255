Bwatch
[[image:Bwatch20.jpg|thumb|/b/watch]]

'''BWatch''' or /b/watch, as it should be called (not to be confused with Baywatch) is a program developed by an [[Australia]]n programmer calling himself Insanemal. It allows a user to key in a URL and, once the settings are configured, the program will go through the thread, saving all the images in it.

As of June 2007, /b/watch is at version v2.2, but version 3.0 is expected any day now. 
The features of /b/watch compared to just saving the images yourself are:

* Ability to Watch threads until their death,
* Renaming of images (Can keep numerals as with normal 4chan images, or in sets, such as 00001-00027.jpg)
* Posting filter compatability (Download strictly either posts with a certain text added, or lacking it)
* Filtering of sage posts (In 2 stages)

The supposed features for v3.0 are:

* Ability to search for RapidShare links (And hopefully other servers)
* Improvements to the filter engine
* Ability to work on other boards
* Ability to rename images back to the name they were posted with

In reality, if this program doesn't work for you then it's 99% likely to be a fault on your end. Any support questions can be thrown at the support email posted below.

==[[Chan Thread Watch]]==
In December 2007 !MNc99 added a new tool to his website, known as [[Chan Thread Watch]]. It can be found at http://sites.google.com/site/chanthreadwatch/. It boasts many features common to that of /b/watch, but is considered a different tool. CTW saves thread HTML and images with emphasis on getting the data (HTTPS support, multi-board support), however /b/watch focuses on the end result (Sage protection, XChan filtering, etc. etc.). CTW is generally easier to use and supports more boards.
