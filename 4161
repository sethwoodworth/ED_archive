J-Rock
[[Image:Gr055.jpg|right|thumb|Some of the many, many fags of J-Rock.]]

'''J-Rock''' (also known as Japanese Rock, butt rock, "HA HA oh what the fuck", or "holy shit that was a man?!") is what fat [[Wapanese|wapanese bitches]] listen to, even though none of them understands what the fuck is being said without looking up some 14 year old girl's dodgy translations on Songmeanings.

==The History of J-Rock==

Many years ago, when the earth’s crust cooled a small part of it invented [[hentai|tentacle porn]].  This really squicked the rest of the crust so the small fucked part was forced to split off into the ocean.  This island became… [[Japan]]

In Japan, after all the people crawled out of the ocean, lost their flippers and developed society and [[Incest|populated]] the island, the crossdresser was invented as a way to both keep women [[in the kitchen|in their place]] and satiate the need for ancient [[lulz]].

After everyone got sick of dinner theater, all the cross dressers needed work so they began to form bands to cover [[Beatles]] songs.  Thus J-Rock was born.

Though not as popular as its bastard third aunt tentacle porn, the influence of J-rock can’t be denied.  It has the power to make people repeatedly humiliate themselves in public (especially in azn restaurants), pay 50 dollars for fucking [[CD|audio cds]] on YesAsia (because nothing makes you more HARDKORRRRRE™ than [[rape|paying out the ass]] for music with lyrics you can't understand), and learn up to 6 words in Japanese, all while switching the region on their DVD player roughly 923480384203 times.

==Types of J-Rock==

There are five common types of J-Rock and they consist of Visual Kei, Oshare Kei, Angura Kei, wannabees, and [[Lie|actual music]].  Nearly all of it that's popular in America is corporate crap.  Imagine 80 clones of [[Linkin Park]] in drag and you have some idea of what people mean when they say they like J-Rock. Most of the bands of this so-called genre like to plagiarize [[homosexual|David Bowie's image]] onto every single aspect of themselves. To [[japanophile|fangirls]] this makes them very [[bullshit|original]].

==Visual Kei==
[[Image:Malice Mizer Le Ciel I.jpg|thumb|right|They started it.]]
'''Visual Kei''' is the most popular form because it's so [[gay|FABULOUS]].  Visual Kei bands (which are completely interchangeable) usually consist of clusters of fags who run around playing air guitar while looking like Ronald McDonald after he got run over by a [[Hot Topic]] truck.  These bands make a big show of being all "dark" and shit, much like any and every [[16 year old girl]] who's ever been near [[deviantART]].  Songs can be recognized by laughably awful vocals that are either over-the-top, tuneless BLAAARGH [[metal]] constipation, or over-the-top crooning that would put [[Morrissey]] to shame. At its heart, Visual Kei is just an ugly rehash of [['70s]] [[Gay|glam rock]], but with far less [[David Bowie|credibility]]. The majority of the bands have French names for some lame reason. Sometimes they also have obscure Japanese names that the Japanese don't even use and never use them in their lifetimes.  VK bands tend to have the largest followings of sadsack, sexually frustrated [[fangirls]], as they have the most ample opportunities for [[slash]].

Bands include:

*[[Fail|X Japan]]
*Nightmare
*[[Kazakai|the GazettE]] (spelling it any other way will result in BAWWW's from teh srs fans)
*Dir en grey (Ditched by fangirls like yesterday's stale Pocky due to newly acquired "mainstream" status, $14 CD's in Hot Topic and their decision to stop dressing like cyberpunk trannies and just make fucking music)
*Lariene
*[[yuffie bunny|Psycho le Cému]]
*G.H.O.S.T
*[[asspie|Miyavi]]
*Rentrer En Soi
*Phantasmagoria
*[[gay|Alice Nine]]
*Kagrra,
*Vidoll
*1[[2012]]
*[[trap|Malice Mizer]]

==Oshare Kei==
[[Image:Osharekei.jpg|right|thumb|"Ok, guyth?  I know this place is called the Horny Sailor but yur gonna have to <i>tone it down.</i>"]]
'''Oshare Kei''', an even more puke-worthy [[cancer|outgrowth]] of Visual Kei, is the newest of the [[faggotry]]. Oshare Kei consists of a bunch fags that look like they stepped out of a bad [[LSD]] trip through an all-gay Mardis Gras and have a lot of piercings.  They pretend to play instruments during some of the most horrifyingly garish music videos you'll ever see.  They pose like [[retards]] and make stupid expressions all the time, probably because if they showed that they took themselves even the slightest seriously they'd be laughed right out of existence. The music sucks 100% of the time and their fanbase consists of [[ADD]]-ridden 13 year-old girls who think they're hot when they just have [[Internet Disease]] [[IRL]].

They also have blogs in which they play [[yaoi]]-bait and pose with teddy bears and talk about how much they want to [[buttsecks]] their other bandmates.  They come up with some retarded names such as "Antique Cafe", but since the fangirls can't pronounce or spell them, they give them even worse ones like "AnCafe".

Bands are:

*[[An Hero|AnCafé]]
*SuG
*Irokui
*Panic*CH
*HeaRt 
*Lolita23q
*Clavier
*[[buttsecks|Buns Mercy]]

==Angura Kei==
[[Image:Mucc-straightjackets.jpg|left|thumb|"We've done caught us a nest!"]]
'''Angura Kei''' bands play songs about [[guro]]. They have a lot of elitist fans that think they're better than the other [[Weeaboo|wee bees]] because their band doesn't give each other fake blowjobs on stage like Visual Kei fags. They do, however, wear so much eyeliner that they look like fucking [[MCR|raccoons]] (or in other cases, Hamburgler from the McDonald's ads).

Angura Kei artists are [[sick fuck|weird]] and many have an obsession with Imperial Japan or [http://i451.photobucket.com/albums/qq236/Poolz_Clozed/DIE_IZ_A_NAZI.jpg the Nazis]. These bands never make it mainstream, and if they do, they end up turning into pussies and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7qpmeQS0mU start singing about skateboarding] and how much fun it is to be a rockstar. They also end up going to [[anime]] conventions and performing for American [[otaku]].









Some of these bands are:

*cali≠gari
*[[Yiff|MUCC]]
*Merry
*[[GIRUGAMESH]]
*D`espairs Ray

==Wannabes==

'''Wannabes''' are the annoying [[sellout]] bands that write all their songs in [[Engrish]] and think they're cool AMELICAN STYRE, but the music still sounds like shit, and the idiot singing [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaXmk2lhKtc still sounds like he's speaking Japanese]. These bands are popular amongst [[13 year old boy]]s, and thus, hated in the general J-Rock wankdom.

Such bands are:

*Ellegarden
*UVERworld
*Heartsdale
*Beat Crusaders
*Orange Range
*Pay money to my pain
*[[wapanese|The Pillows]]
*Any other Japanese band that did a song for an anime in Engrish

==J-Fail==

[[Image:Kogureband.jpg|right|thumb|Typical wannabe Jrockers]]
[[Image:Schwarzefanboy.jpg|right|thumb| Even J-FAIL bands get their share of pussy]]
'''J-Fail''' is what you call the fail J-rocker/J-band wannabe. They're usually not <s>slanty eyed</s> Japanese, and their music sucks 10 times more than an actual J-band, and usually they'll channel the look and sound of [[gay|Malice Mizer]] or [[pussy|Versailles]].

Such <s>raging homos</s> bands are:
*[http://www.myspace.com/gothicdollsband GothicDolls] Possibly the funniest sounding J-Fail on the fucking planet!
*[http://www.myspace.com/541rock SAI] (one of the oldschool J-Fails that still havent got the point, yet)
*[http://www.myspace.com/kayakoproject Kayako Project] (This is what you get when you mix France with Jrock. this is possibly more FAIL than all french military defeats put together)
*[http://www.myspace.com/myrrahofficial Myrrah]
*[http://www.myspace.com/machinashogunate Machina Shogunate]
*[http://www.myspace.com/lyrealive Lyre]
*[http://www.myspace.com/secretsecret9 Secret Secret] (Its no secret that this guy fucking sucks)

*[http://www.myspace.com/mayukasolo Mayuka]
*[http://www.myspace.com/gaidjinn Gaïdjinn]
*[http://www.myspace.com/gargoyleinvirtue Gargoyle in Virtue] Simply terrible!

*[http://www.myspace.com/blackveilbrides Black Veil Brides]
*Any other band that tries to look like a group of homos

==Fangirls==
[[Image:J-rock.jpg|right|thumb|We are so Kawaii!]]

The J-Rock fandom consists mainly of sexless fangirls of varying age and mental instability scattered around [[MySpace]], [[deviantART]] and [[LJ]]. They are the worst of any fandom for anything ever and consist of the most retarded members of all the other [[Wapanese]] groups. Usually they write really gay fanfictions, draw really gay pictures, and make annoying gay avatars and banners that have been the targets of many a regretted wank by confused men.  They hate anything that deals with a vagina, including each other. Rarely, there are male J-rock fans, but most of them are in [[denial]] about loving the cock so they pretend to pine over Japanese men who look like 12 year old girls and then insist "My [[love#Love on teh Internets|girlfriend]] [[lie|made me do it!]]". Alternatively, they can be fat basement-dweller straight fags who listened to too many [[Naruto]] theme songs and mistook Izam for Sakura, masturbating furiously.

J-Rock obsessives live in a delusional world in which every Japanese man looks like a girl and every Japanese man is gay. Women do not exist in Japan because they're all actually crossdressing men. Japanese procreate by the use of spores and some kind of alien tube shit. Despite this belief that Japan is a country of gay men, they still want these fags to bone them... but forget the fact that if they're fucking each other [[in the ass|in the poop hole]] then obviously their cocks are not going in their vaginas. It's likely that these girls are just used to having every single male they've ever met claim they were gay as a straight response to seeing their face. It's also common knowledge that most JRock bandguys would sooner fuck an [[Vanessa_Alexandra |AIDS-infested hooker]] than any of their fans but it doesn't stop fangirls from blowing every single dollar they have, just like [[your mom]] did on those guys at the [[Stripper |All Male Review.]]

Fangirls can usually be spotted among the greasiest of the [[acne]] lepers at anime conventions, and are usually either morbidly obese or completely androgynous (maybe both and not androgynous in the [[trap|pleasant way]], more like the [[lesbian|big fat bulldyke way]]).  They can often be heard screaming words such as "kawaii!" "kakoii!" and "bishies!" while watching [[Gundam Wing]] or any other show that fuels their [[yaoi | warped sexual cravings]] or buying [[dollfie|dollfies]] for a large amount of money to stick up their [[cunt|fangina]]. J-cunts are also very anal about where they get their music and are incredibly butthurt over [[torrent|illegal downloading]], neverminding the fact that if some Jap faggot hadn't ripped and uploaded that shit to Napster [[over 9000]] years ago, they would've never discovered any of the shitty bands whose songs they so pathetically mime the words to.

==Fanboys==
[[Fanboys]] in most cases are worst than the [[fangirls]] they bitch about so much. These boys are self-correcting, always right and just as obsessive. Now both sides think that one or the other is the worst, though of course both should be shot. The fanboys lust after Japanese men more than the fangirls, if possible. More J-rock cosplayers/elites are male who think they know everything from indies bands to defunct horrible VK acts. They are among some of the worst people imaginable. Some go to the non-fans point where they pretend to be gay to get laid. For some odd reason they are usually from Europe. Want to see some amazing lulz on behalf of the male side? Check out any Dir en grey music discussion post; the cock-sucking involved there is amazing, it's all one big sausage fest. There is a very small fraction of male fans who haven't lost every ounce of dignity in their bodies or allowed their love of such [[shit |unique music]] to infect them with the dreaded [[Elitist_musical_bastards | EMB]] virus. When found, you can actually attempt a conversation with them about Japanese Rock and not get a response full of either high-pitched squeeing or [[unwarranted self importance]]. However, these encounters are few and far between... You have a better chance of getting to Antarctica on foot.

A perfect example of a "know it all" fanboy is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cyrus_XIII Cyrus_XIII] on WP.  He is a WP-Nazi who claims that books on Jrock are not good enough [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AX_Japan&diff=168392790&oldid=158531315  resource] and btw the New York Times isn't a valid resource either.  His favorite pastime is blanking pages to "merge" them with another article - and then not adding any of the content, effectively deleting the page while side-stepping WP's deletion policy.  

Watch his edits for lots of [[LULZ]].

==Tonberry / Impact Media.uk==
[[Image:Board-topics.jpg|right|thumb|In-depth convos indeed!]]
If you want to see some of the best [[Fanboys]] and their sidekicks ignorant European [[Fangirls]] the best place to view these creatures in the wild is Batsu, but someone was soooo butthurt they made a huge entry here about Tonberry, which is a tiny who-the-fuck-cares forum full of trolls, that even has a dedicated trolls-only area.  Batsu is usually just as much of a lulzpit, though they do occasionally have real conversations (which later turn into hilarious flames that get posted to [http://community.livejournal.com/jrock_wank JRock_Wank]) 

But onto info about Tonberry:

A UK based forum with no moderation whatsoever, even the mods that do post are one in a few. Save one mod, Joe Sushi and DO. Surprisingly those two have a brain, but not enough of a brain to actually mod their own website. Yet they leave it up to the only mod who is just as bad as the people who live in the flame pit, baka_neko. The board overall has about 80% lurker status and 5% that actually know what they are talking about and the rest are ignorant [[Fucktards]] or skilled trolls here to mess with the [[Fucktards]]. The people on the board are irritable, racist and are comparable to those on [[4chan]].  It's the worst place to go if you want coherent actual music discussion as every discussion results in a flame war between a 19 year old [[Russian]] and some equally ignorant 15 year old [[American]].  If anyone had to chose what they wanted more, better Asian music discussion go to Batsu (it at least has that), or utter lulz flame wars go to Tonberry (where the average age is 19 and the average user is [[Eurotrash]]). 

Liking anything other than VK or O-share Kei will get you trolled for no reason. Actually, posting ANYTHING will get you trolled for no reason - trolls are not known for being reasonable. Also having any common sense and not fighting dirty with a bunch of kids and sugar coating every post with <3 and "OMG , YEZ I R HAPPY" will pretty much get you targeted. Granted if there was an age limit and a competency test Tonberry would reign supreme over Batsu. In the last year Batsu and Tonberry were at the same level of [[Faggotry]] but Tonberry has pulled far ahead, resulting in a couple of members making their own forums just to get away from said ignorance.
