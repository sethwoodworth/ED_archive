Bodybuilding is a <s>sport</s> homoerotic beauty pageant where walking drug stores in thongs flex their shredded glutes for a bunch of closeted fags.  '''Bodybuilders''' are very sexy, if you find [[fugly]] veins, tiny [[penis]]es, and outrageous vanity to be a turn on. [[Stupid]] to start with, bodybuilders add to their natural [[retard]]ation by taking steroids, [[Diabeetus|insulin]], human growth hormone, diuretics, and synthol though they will vehemently deny it. Yeah, it's all [[cum|protein shakes]], [[cum|egg white]] omelets and [[shit nobody cares about|creatine]].<br>
The bodybuilding industry is a scam meant to prey on your insecurities for the purpose of selling you worthless, overpriced supplements, while showing off bodybuilders with enough prescription and or illegal drugs in them to stock a pharmacy.  All but the top pro bodybuilders are poorly paid and must resort to gay 4 pay for the industries many repressed homosexual schmoes to make ends meet.  Pro bodybuilders are incredibly unhealthy due to muscular obesity and can't run up a flight of stairs without passing out.

[[Arnold Schwarzenegger|Female bodybuilders]] are identical to male bodybuilders except they have to wear bikini tops over the misshapen chest area where their breasts used to be, and [[trap|have much larger pen0rs.]]

==The History of Bodybuilding==
Bodybuilding began [[at least 100 years ago]] when Jesus advised the Jews that they should maintain physical strength and fitness in order to properly complete manual activities, such as building the pyramids. 

It fell into disfavor when people discovered guns but became popular again when [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] proved that determination, hard work, and six-pack glutes can make a person [[pizza and beer|rich and famous]] despite stupidity and the inability to speak [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|English]].

NEWS FLASH!!! BODYBUILDING IS SATANIC!!!

==Supplements==
[[Image:Meathead Powder.jpg|thumb|Im in ur gym, drinkin ur sperm.]]
Just like the [[glenn beck|CIA]] invented crack cocaine to [[lulz|destroy African American communities]] (fuckin win), weakling science nerds invented "supplements" to steal meathead's moneys and shrink their pen0rs.

Types of workout AIDS:

*'''Protein''' - The cocaine that fuels the [[Guido|Jersey shore.]]  Looks like chunky sperm and/or diarrhea and tastes like a combination of both.  '''PUSH IT TO THE MAX!!!''' Test your body's ability to process nitrogen by taking over 500 grams of protein a day, shitting out your kidneys and filling the whites of your eyes with the yellow byproduct of dying organ tissue and blood cells.  You'll get HUGE lifting your dialysis machine around for [[Dying alone|the rest of your life!]]
**''Special Ability: +10 to beating up [[you|nerds]]. +12.5% chance of tribal tattoo on biceps per level of [[Douchebag|Ed Hardy]] shirt.

*'''Creatine''' - [[shit nobody cares about|Science will tell you]] creatine is a [[TL;DR|naturally occurring organic acid that supplies energy to muscle cells.]]  This is in fact LIES.  Creatine is [[over 9000]] times [[moar]] powerful than [[drug|PCP]] and steroids combined and is [[Whale Wars|harvested from the tender young glands of baby whales.]] 
**''Special Ability:  5% chance to critical hit against innocent bystanders, and grants a base +6 damage also cumulative with any other bonuses during random encounters with 98 pound weaklings.''

*'''Nitric Oxide (NO''') - [[NO U]].  Gives you roadmap-like veins on your dick and generates cancer-causing free radicals in your bloodstream.  Fuckin win!
**''Special Ability:  Summon unsightly forehead veins.''

*'''NOXPLODE''' - Need an extra [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:NO_XPLODE_ingredients.png 500 unregulated/untested chemicals] pumping through your bloodstream while you work out?  '''FUCK YES YOU DO!'''  Thats why you paid [[Noob|$65 for it at GNC!]] 
**''Special Ability:  +75 to ipod volume. +30 to grunting.  These stats gain a 5% bonus in strength per number of "Fraternity Bros" in gym.'' 

*'''Steroids''' - [[Chris Benoit|Builds so much muscle and RAAAAAAGE that you will spend your free time beating your wife and son to death while simultaneously masturbating to yourself in the mirror with your tiny cock and balls.  Combine with oxycontin to hang yourself from a cable pulldown machine in your basement.]]
**''Special Ability:  Summon Spotter -Instantly forces the nearest [[dick neck|pencil neck]] with stats equivaltent to your own divided by half to follow you around for 180 seconds, assisting you by attacking your opponents and massaging your ego about how awesome you are until either the timer runs out, or the minion is slain.  

*'''METHAMPHETAROIDS!!!''' - [[Jesus|Grants immortality]] and the ability to [[Winrar|punch women and children]] into alternate dimensions.  [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Epic-LongBattle.jpg Side effects] are generally mild.
**''Special Ability:  9001% bonus to strength, rape stamina and violent outbursts.  Immunity from tazers.''

==Income==

Where do they get the money to buy all the shitty "supplements" you ask? Most bodybuilders don't make a living from bodybuilding. Only the ones that make it into film like [[The Governator]] make any money from the "sport". Where they do make the money is from gay porn and "gay for pay" sessions. Female bodybuilders make their money turning [[BDSM|semi]]-[[Prostitute|tricks]] for schmoes who enjoy a muscular gal [[scissoring]] them to near suffocation.

**"God, all bodybuilders are [[retard]]s, and a danger to not only themselves but to society as well. Get that muscle gained through artificial means off their bodies and the world will be a better place, I say! [...] And after we get rid of the buff people, we'll kill the [[fat]] people and use their oil-laden bodies to feed the starving children in [[Africa]], who by the way, WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN STARVING if those self-absorbed egocentric selfish bodybuilders hadn't been wasting all of those calories!

**"Im an athelete, not a bodybuilder, and the number one irritating comment I hear is 'You are so lucky to be so slim!'. I tell my friends that the hardest excercise I do every day is the one where I knock the stuffing out of the big [[fat]], lazy, chocolate eating, [[tv]] watching, [[asswipe]] that lives deep inside of me."
*[http://ezinearticles.com/?id=138050 Roid Gut the End of the Aesthetic Physique]
**"In mid 80's, Human Growth Hormone (HGH) and Insulin became popular drugs with professional bodybuilders. The net result, with these top level competitors, is the "Roid Gut". Now days, we have bodybuilders sporting a 40-46" waists. I am guessing, of course, since no competitor would dare share the mammoth size of their waistlines."

==Typical Bodybuilder Workout Day==

[[Image:Shooped Steroids Comparison.jpg|thumb|center|500px|The before and after of this regime.]]

*5AM: Steroid Injection
*5:15AM: Weigh-in... 1000 pounds (morbidly obese, [[retard|BUT it's muscle, NOT fat!]]
*6AM: Breakfast: 50 egg omelette
*7AM: Workout with 2L of Sperm Supplement
*12AM: Lunch: horse dicks in sperm sauce (bodyfags regard cocks to be the best source of protein and eat copious amounts; [[science|they also believe that sucking the cocks of men and animals is a 100% absorption method of the precious amino acids]])
*1PM:  Workout with Urine Electrolyte Booster Supplement 
*7PM: Dinner: [[your mom|a whole cow]]
*7:15PM: Workout     
*11PM: Weigh-in... 10.000 pounds (thanks to eating [[your mom]]) The bodyfag then immediately has an orgasm and exclaims [[retard|"Yes!!! I have gained 9.000 pounds of pure muscle in this day! I'm almost reaching my goal of being 100.000 pounds of pure force!!!!!!!")]]
*12PM: Sleep (but only if gay sex isn't available)

NOTE: Time spent between hours is looking in the mirror and/or flexing the muscles and/or gay sex.

NOTE2: Cardio <s>may be</s> IS ALWAYS included in the form of fapping furiously to pictures of muscular gay men for <s>extended</s> MARATHON periods of time.   

In any case, all sane people know that bodyfag "muscles" are just [[turd|fatty, watery, roidy, inflated, toxic cancerous cells]] and not true muscle mass that [[you|real men]] possess.

== Trolling ==
Bodybuilders are typically very easy to troll, due to their tiny brains and massive amounts of testosterone/steroid abuse. These will all send a body builder into a blinding [[Chris Benoit|roid rage]]. He will try to throw you hella far but will only destroy his monitor before he realizes he can't squish someone in an [[internet]] conversation. Then he will go to the gym to sulk and [[buttsex|pump some iron]]. Another sure fire way to [[troll]] a [[guido|bodybuilder]] is to ask how many cock pushups [[you|he]]/[[tranny|she]]/[[lol wut|it]] can do. Since their cocks have been swallowed up by muscle mass due to massive weightlifting, they can do a whole [[divide by zero|0]].

* Tell him his triceps look small.
* Tell them they could get bigger if they used Steroids. This will either cause them to up their dose of the steroids they are taking or will get them started.
* Say "Your muscles are big but they are not too defined, try some lightweights so your muscles don't look like massive blobs under your skin".
* Tell them how much success you have had with a high carb no protein diet, and stick to your story.
* Tell them you work out 1/4 as much as them and are twice as big.
* Any workout they say they do tell them "I used to do that too when i first started"
* Ask if benching 200 pounds is so easy for you why do you need to have a guy 1/2 your size spot you?
* Tell them that bodybuilding is a homosexual oriented activity, aimed at gays or closeted fags.
* Tell them that steroids are unsafe and cause roid rage.
* Tell them that 'a calorie is a calorie'.
* Tell them that an obviously roided up bodybuilder is all natural.

== MySpace Bodybuilders ==
[[Image:Myspacebodybuilder.jpg|thumb|Typical display of malnutrition found on MySpace]]
These are the easiest to find, just run a search on a name like __(single letter) dawg and it will yield many results. They usually have some shitty rap song on their profile and/or the current most popular rock band there is. In their albums it will be hard not to find a picture that does not involve them posing with a flexed arm or just lifting up their T-shirt to show their 6 pack.Typical blogs go something like this:
I have not hit the gym in liek 4 weeks but i lost like 5 pounds of fat
I have just started working out again it has only been like 3 days. I got on the scale for the first time in months and I in just 3 days I have put on like 10 lbs of muscle.
These guys are pretty easy to troll too, just tell them that a 6 pack is impressive on a 170lbs man and NOT impressive on someone who only weighs 140lbs.
