In 1996, Toby Gard had a dream. After he had cleaned himself off with tissues, he invented Lara Croft, Tomb Raider and [[win|everything else himself with no help whatsoever from anybody else]]. Then he invented [[pirate|Galleon]] and the film Cradle of Life. Meanwhile thanks to the efforts of [[cosplayer]]s to get their [[queers|boyfriends]]/girlfriends/dogs off whilst dressed as Lara Croft a spin-off game was created on the back of the new [[sex]] craze. All of this would be of no interest to the readers of [[ED]] if it was not for the explosion of Tomb Raider [[Les_Six|forums]], [[Jeff_Gerstmann|chatrooms]], [[crap|fanfiction]] and [[eidos|merchandising]] that have swamped the internets, filling all of the tubes with milky white liquid.

==Lulziest quote ever==

{{quote|Complete realism wasn't possible, of course, and Gard intended Lara to have somewhat exaggerated dimensions from the start. While making test adjustments to her girlish figure, [[lie|a slip of his mouse]] turned an intended 50% increase to her [[breast]] size into a 150% [[win|gain]]. It met with instant approval from the team before he could correct it.}}
From [http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/856/856183p1.html]. What utter crap. [[Eidos|Toby Gard]] gave Lara big [[tits]] because he [[incest|fancied his sister]].


{{quote|As far as [[Eidos]] was concerned, Lara [[fap|single-handedly]] took them from a $2.6 million deficit to a $14.5 million profit in just one year. They were damn well going to take advantage of the most unique opportunity in marketing history: a virtual [[sex]] symbol. [[butthurt|Disillusioned by the complete lack of creative control over his own character]], Gard left Core.}}
Creepy [[wanker]].

==Nude Hacks==

Tomb Raider is a common [[masturbation]] tool for [[13 year old boys]] who don't use the [[ass|ED]] porn challenge. As Lara Croft has tits, she is a clear subject for [[rule 34]]. However, there are very few good artists who bother with her, so what we are left with is [[deviantart|shitty 3-D renders]] from the same [[sick fuck]] who thinks having her shit out [[lion|raccoons]] from her snatch is [[hot]].

To fill this need, in [[at least 100 years ago|1997]] a site called Nude Raider  developed nude patches for Tomb Raider 2. They had found a niche market for people who wanted to jerk off to horrible triangular pixelated breasts that were made worse by equally bad nude hacks. But [[Eidos]] demolished the shit out of the site, and currently own the [[wikipedia|url]].

Edios then did it themselves, giving Lara different outfits for [[virgin|players]] to jerk off to, including generic skin-tight [[cat|catsuits]] and bikinis, culminating in a [[vagina|crotchless]] scuba suit for the forthcoming game Tomb Raider Underpants.

==The Many Deaths of Lara==
One of the main [[crap|selling points]] of the game is that players will often [[die]] over and over again because, unless they jump from an exact pixel and land on an exact pixel, THEY WILL DIE. 

* Falling off a high place and dying
* Falling into a spike pit
* Drowning
* Caught in an explosion
* Burned alive
* Getting eaten by a dinosaur.
* Cut to shreds by spinning blades
* Crushed to death
* Shot to death
* Savaged to death by a variety of angry animals, including bats, [[cat|rats]], endangered species, and dinosaurs.
* Caught in a car crash
* [[AIDS]]

However, as she is loaded from getting shitloads of cash from when her parents kicked the bucket, thus gaining the title 'Lady', she will eventually die in a car crash.

==Movies==

Two incredibly crapass, [[breasts|artistic]] movies were made based on the games: Lara Croft, Tomb Raider and Lara Croft, Tomb Raider: [[Electric Boogaloo|The Cradle of Life]]. The first one is distinguished by Angelina Jolie's massive [[tits]]. The second one has smaller tits and [[Gerard Butler]]. Neither movie had any distinguishable plot, beyond "grab old thing and shoot the fuck out of people." The movies are generally watched by [[sick fucks]] or [[Tart|nasty disgusting old whores who masturbate to either star]].<br><br>

'''NEW!!!''' [http://www.tombraiderascension.com/ Tomb Raider: Ascension] - fan made film that's not quite as good as The Cradle of Life. Doesn't star Angelina Jolie.<br>

==Lara does the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Ring_Thing Silver Ring Thing]==
[[Image:lara_gay_beach.jpg|thumb|Lara Croft about to be [[raped]] of her virginity by some [[lesbians]] ]]
There is a bizarre section of the [[virgin|Tomb Raider community]] that insist that Lara Croft is a virgin (as well as being teetotal, a non-smoker and a non-user of [[cunt|cusswords]]). Safe to say that these people are either;
* American [[16_year_old_girls|My Little Pony fans]] who have never met a real [[British]] woman
* [[13_year_old_boys|Disney fans]] who are scared by [[Porn|Nude Raider]] <br> 
* [[Christian|Religious fanatics]] with an agenda.
Balancing these [http://www.tombraiderchronicles.com delusionals] out are the equally delusional people who suspect Lara Croft is bisexual or lesbian[http://uk.tickle.com/test/lesbianicon/result/sexy.html], possibly because they think it is [[encyclopedia_dramatica|naughty]] to do so, or because they identify Lara too much with Angelina Jolie. We'd post links, but most of them would have been to conversations at  [[Fag|Justin J. Farr]]'s Tomb Raider Forums[http://tombraiderforums.com] that have been deleted by the [[Les Six|Eidos marketing department]].<br>

==Working on Lara is good for your career==

{{quote|[[eidos|It]] employs much of its staff as though they are permanent, when in fact, they know that they will lay most of them off when production ramps down retaining only a slim group for the next preproduction phase.

Without exception, (as far as I’m aware) those who are let go lose any rights to future royalties or bonuses after having spent the last X months in crunch.

It’s a bit nasty isn’t it? In fact I think you could call it almost dishonest. }}

==Deviant Raider - Lara as [[otherkin]]==

[[lie|Not everybody]] at ED hates [[furries]]. However there is something ironic about portraying Lara Croft as a [[furry]], given that of all [[people|the imaginary characters]] not [[IRL|in the real world]], she is the one most likely to [[pwn|mow]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherkin Otherkin] down in a [[gun|hail of lead]]. To paraphrase Tomb Raider's most [[win|famous]] [[retard|fanfiction writer]] ''"Yiff in Hell, Furfags," shrieked Lara. BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!''
