[[Moot]] posted this below on [[4chan]] on March 10, 2010:

[[File:MootVsAnontalk.gif|center|800px]]

The good moot of course knew better than to ruin his site with a [[CAPTCHA]], which most spambots can read better than humans by now anyways.


The archive of the email content is in the section below titled, "Kimmo Alm Emails".

From http://content.4chan.org/tmp/kimmo_alm_emails.html
Retreived March 12, 2010

Notice how Kimmo lies about spamming and then immediately asks for a link exchange. Not very convincing.  Also notice how Kimmo likes to put the same thing for the subject and body of a message, which is something that auto-bans you if you do it on anontalk.com.

For the "illegal clone" comment, it's because [[Jan Martin]] was an ex-[[moderator]] of AnonTalk who after getting banned, went to found the first clone of AnonTalk, [[Tinychan]], and then spammed it on AnonTalk and got Kimmo [[butthurt]] ever since.

=Kimmo Alm Emails=
This text contains all of the e-mails Kimmo Alm aka Sysop has sent me. It also contains all of my responses, and a few of the e-mails sent to our host.

See [[Anontalk.com|ED]] for the backstory. The short of it is Kimmo has been spamming 4chan for <b>YEARS</b>. We've banned <b>THOUSANDS</b> of IPs, and deleted at least a hundred thousand spam posts at this point. He spams 4chan to advertise his website, which is really just a haven for pedophiles.

On to the fun stuff! (My comments in '**'s)

<nowiki>**</nowiki>Here's the first e-mail he ever sent. He later claims he didn't, but that's bullshit (see headers).**

(Apparently, you don't know your own users...)

I did send you several e-mails about this in the past but they apparently  
got ignored. I hope that you will read and consider this, in case you  
actually never got the old e-mails. Or maybe reconsider it, if you did and  
just ignored them.

None of us like each other, obviously, but I still seriously propose that  
we set up some sort of mutual link exchange. This would obviously cut down  
on any spam to the level of "few trolls trying to stir up a war", and  
hopefully, not even that would happen after a while.

I actually used to have a free banner text for 4chan, linking to "/b/"  
with a text such as "Tired of using your brains? Relax and enjoy images."  
(or something alone those lines). I would be prepared to bring that back,  
as well as removing all the banned phrases related to "4chan". In return,  
I expect you would put a rotating text or graphical banner (doesn't  
matter) on the 4chan boards. It doesn't need to get heavy "weight" or  
anything, as long as it sticks around and is permanent.

I really think that this would solve a ton of problems and I frankly  
cannot imagine why you would turn this offer down at this point.  
Hopefully, you will not. We don't need to like each other. The two boards  
obviously serve completely different needs, and I would very happily get  
rid of "sloppy" posters who just want to use memes and such. At the same  
time, I do recognize that there are people with brains surfing your board,  
and nothing stops them from using both.

As I suggested the last time, I'm OK with rather "unflattering" ad texts  
such as: "Feeling anal-retentive? Then check out AnonTalk.com!". However,  
it would be nice if we could agree on the specifics. I'm prepared to do  
this within hours.

Think about it. Nobody (or at least much fewer) would have a reason to  
spam/"raid" either board if both link to each other, while agreeing to  
disagree.

Excitedly awaiting your response.

We don't do any external links, besides paid banner ads. Essentially

4channers wouldn't give two shits about AnonTalk if you stopped spamming 
4chan. All you've done for the past two years is use spam on 4chan as a 
means to advertise your website.

No, that's not what I'm saying. Did you read the letter?

Right. You apparently choose to ignore the real issue and assume things in  
order to dismiss this very serious proposal.

I really thought that you would see things differently, but apparently  
not. In a few days, AT is two years old and it would have been a great  
"fresh start" to not have any chantards constantly coming there to scream  
and post junk due to "spam" in threads.

You think advertising is free on AT? It's not. I was (and still am, but  
not for long) prepared to give you a prominent backlink as well, but you  
seem completely uninterested in this.

It would be a simple matter of displaying a small link randomly on every  
Xth page load across the boards. If you don't already have such a system  
in order, which I believe you do, it would be extremely easy to code.

The offer still stands, but this really is the last time I'm going to try  
to reason with you. I actually do have better things to do than sending  
fruitless e-mails.

(I can make a small custom graphical banner if you want, and you can get a  
(static) image banner as well.)

No, that's not it. It's: "If both of us link to each other's board, which  
are not in direct competition, this should finally stop most/all problems  
related to attacks and counter attacks."

> Am I missing something here?

Yes. I must say that I thought that you would either not respond at all,  
or do respond positively.

Do you have any idea how much money, time and grey hairs your users and  
their damn attacks have cost me? You let them go on. I'm saying that I'm  
willing to look past that for the greater good, but you insist on being  
hostile. I won't start praising 4chan all of a sudden -- I think its users  
have done far more damage to the Internet than anything else -- but it  
can't be denied that it's got traffic, with a certain number of posters  
who would also make great "AnTs", and that's why I care.

If you don't respond to this, or yet again ignore what I write, I'll know  
that you're not interested, and in that case, I will give up all attempts  
to talk to you and won't contact you again. Otherwise (and I really hope  
that this will be the case), I can have the 4chan ad active very quickly.  
You don't need to make a big deal out of it (such as announcing it in any  
way) if you fear user reactions.

That's not your primary e-mail address, you psychotic troll.

Remove that crap from your servers or I will have your domain name  
deactivated and you kicked out from your host. This time, you are  
blatantly hosting illegal material, knowingly. Not even you will get away  
with this.

First you clone the Japanese board, and now my work. You just can't seem  
to create anything original, can you?

I unbanned the banned phrase "4chan" at AT and asked you very nicely for a  
link exchange to end the "war", and this is how you respond? You have some

I'm unsure of what the issue is. 4chan is almost seven years old, and 
that subdomain has existed since 2003. That predates AnT, no?

You are extremely sure of what the issue is. The subdomain has certainly

And it's "AT" -- not "AnT". I can't even tell if you're seriously this

You are not REQUIRED to permit illegal content on your servers. You just
DON'T WANNA remove it. You don't FEEL like it, because you don't like me,
my Web site, my "tone" or whatever reason you might have for keeping this
"game" up. I'm not stupid. If you actually wanted to, the site would be
gone within nano seconds. You choose to keep this psychopath because you
want to make it difficult for me.

This is typical. WHY do you have to keep making my life an obnoxious hell?
I have WORK to do; I can't spend all my time dealing with these fucking
uncooperative companies that don't know their own good.

I won't send you any more documents. You will either remove the illegal
content from your God damn server OR face the consequences. I am DONE
filling out these bullshit forms and sending them in to you and other
people who don't even read them. Handle this immediately or you'll regret
it. I promise you this. This is not an empty threat by some nobody -- it
is a serious matter which will eventually run your company into
bankruptcy. It may take some time, but I will not forget this.

PS: I have no idea who you are and I don't have anything against
you personally. My issue is with your company and how you are handling
legitimate abuse complaints.

Subject: Illegal clone of my software hosted on your servers: tiny.4chan.org (URGENT!)<br>
<br>
Dear OC3 Networks,<br>
<br>
The owner of the domain 4chan.org, "moot", has, I believe for what must be several months now, been hosting http://tiny.4chan.org/ on your servers. It is an illegal, unauthorized verbatim clone of my original, copyrighted, closed source work http://www.AnonTalk.com/. My board was unique and started in early 2008. This board was put up a few days ago, in year 2010, and has copied everything from the structure and messages to ideas and feature. It is hidden underneath a shell that is supposed to look somewhat different, however, in order to fool people looking into abuse complaints such as this one. Yes, it sounds unlikely, but this person is a dangerous thief and psychopath and, together with his "crew" of Internet "trolls", has been harassing me for years.<br>
<br>
I have sent many e-mails to him, but he ignores them entirely or sends mocking replies back. The owner of the domain is known as a copycat and the entire Web site 4chan.org (cloned of a Japanese BBS) revolves around copyright violations and organizing illegal "raids" and harassments of people in real life and on the Internet. The Web site's userbase has been very seriously harassing our board for over two years now with daily spam, "trolling" and DDoS attacks, all organized on 4chan.org and allowed, encouraged and sometimes *initiated* by the "creator" (I wouldn't call it "creating" when you just copy and paste a concept).<br>
<br>
The clone in question, which is the main part of my complaint, incorrectly claims copyright of the software and has a fake copyright year stated in the meta data (and possibly on the board itself -- I refuse to check it any longer). This is obviously inaccurate and just one of the many attempts to damage us.<br>
<br>
I have carefully read up on your AUP, ToS and legal documents, and American law, and it is completely clear to me that you are required not only by your own policies, but the actual law, to remove 4chan.org from your servers, effective immediately. The next best thing, as far as we are concerned, is for you to get this person to at least remove the subdomain "tiny.4chan.org", as this is separate from the main site. The main site is not violating our specific IPs, and may continue in a "worst case" scenario as far as we are concerned. (Although it is still illegal and violates your policies and many laws; you may want to look into that separately when we are done with each other.)<br>
<br>
Our only demand is that either you convince the owner to remove the illegal subdomain board, or remove all hosting for 4chan. If you comply, no legal action will be taken toward OC3 Networks.<br>
<br>
Should you still continue to ignore this request, legal action will very soon be taken toward OC3 Networks. We take this extremely seriously and will demand a large amount of money for all the damages that your client (and, by proxy, you) has caused us in terms of uptime, goodwill, labor and intellectual property damages.<br>

I think that's about it. Kimmo has sent all sorts of great e-mails to Jan Martin of Tinychan, most of which are on Encyclopedia Dramatica.
He's also posted all sorts of crazy bulletins on his site, which are also archived in various places.
