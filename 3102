What's funnier than somebody doing something really stupid?  

Probably somebody doing something stupid and then having the whole world react like a bunch of morons on top of it all.  Confused?  Bear with ED here for a minute and all shall be explained while we attempt to show you how '''Frosty''' can be an '''Inappropriate Snowman'''.

==History==
[[Image:Frosty the Inappropriate Snowman - 2.jpg|thumb|Frosty finds out he has been besmirched.]]
In early December of 2009, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) decided it would be a great idea to engage in an advertisement campaign that was similar to the “mash up” movement that can be found on the various video hosting sites on the internet.  It went pretty much like this: “Sure, this is going good, perhaps we can pick one of our prime time shows…and mash it up with Frosty the Snowman and use the resulting clip to advertise BOTH shows.  PURE GENIUS!

Actually, from a business standpoint, the idea was pretty good.  The network could get twice the advertising in half the time, give its viewers a quick laugh, and make sure that Frosty the Snowman would not be forgotten by the average viewer who always forgets to DVR all the good Christmas specials.  Things were going great, right up until the point where they decided to mash up Frosty with Barney from the hit show (some might call sleazy hit show) “How I Met Your Mother.”

Anybody with a passing familiarity with the show knows that Barney is a promiscuous, womanizing, cheating, and corrupting sewage rat who has absolutely no conscience whatsoever when it comes to achieving money or pleasure.  Played excellently by [[fag| Neil Patrick Harris]], Barney’s voice-over of some of the original Frosty cartoon artwork causes huge amounts of internet rage within seconds of the advertisements.  Viewers immediately got on the series of tubes and began to express (loudly and angrily) butthurt, loathing, and some even cried for the destruction of CBS…all during a holiday season who’s main purpose is to openly express good will towards men.

CBS wasn’t paying any attention to any of this rage and went ahead with their plan to release more of the commercials, most notably a mash up of “Two and a Half Men” and Frosty yet again, this time using the voice-over of Charlie Sheen, yet another over-sexed ne’er-do-well malcontent within the CBS stable of hit shows.

As stated above, the reaction was swift and fierce.  In a world where most 8 year olds can access and have the ability to utilize Google, parents were breathless in their diatribes against CBS and the contaminating content of their insidious advertisements.  How could CBS ruin such a staple of the holiday season?  How could CBS besmirch the good name of honest and jolly Frosty?  Surely, this year’s Christmas was going to be just that much less joyous because of the shameful way CBS has abused the Christmas icon.

|WTF. What asshole at CBS made this up? I agree, it's all [[shock|shock value]]. I don't see anything funny about mashing up a classic kids Christmas cartoon with inappropriate content. Haha. Frosty is saying inappropriate things. How old are these people who made this? 12?

[[Image:Frosty the Inappropriate Snowman - 6.jpg|thumb|Gay Womanizer]]
{{quote|Rather than ignore those who choose to publish their opinions without actually talking to me, I am happy to dispel any rumors or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man living my life|Neil, talking candidly about his faggotry to [http://quotelucy.com/quotes/neil-patrick-harris-quotes.html People Magazine] in 2006}}
Many of the comments directed at the ad campaign focus on Neil Patrick Harris’s character “Barney” being an inhuman womanizer, and those comments seem to confuse the actor with the character he plays.  The buzz talk goes something like this:  “That Neil Patrick Harris…he used to be so cute and so nice on that Doogie Howser show…why is he such a lecherous lothario on this new show of his?”  

While this might be funny in and of itself, as fat, older Americans wish that their childhood stars could stay children forever, the real humor of the whole thing is the fact that Neil Patrick Harris is an openly gay actor who has never had any qualms about outing himself in the public.
