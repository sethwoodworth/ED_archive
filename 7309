Screamer
The '''screamer''' also known as a '''Prank Flash''' is a [[retarded|simple]] and yet extremely effective way to make people [[shit bricks]]. Screamers are sort of like [[Goatse]] - they take you by surprise, they're horrifying and the worst of all - you can't unsee them. [http://www.tekzoned.com/whatswrong/ This] is said to be one of the first examples to show up on the internets in 2002, asking the seemingly innocent question '''what is wrong with this picture?''' Of course within minutes [[ebaumsworld]], [[theft|picked up]] the flash and popularized the prank.

Nowadays, Screamers are a common breed on the [[internets]], due to the [[13 year old boys]] that [[masturbate]] the prank flashes all over the webs. 

== How it Works ==

Screamers involve a [[Flash]] program that displays images carefully selected for their apparent relationship to [[Whatever|some premise]], such as [[Bullshit|subliminal messages]].  Many of them also include ridiculously quiet soundtracks, either very quietly played "scary" music or someone whispering incomprehensibly, which would appear at first to be part of the ambiance.  Of course, in reality, this is all just a setup.  The images have nothing to do with anything, and the soundtrack exists solely to force [[Idiot|the unwitting viewer]] to turn up the volume.

After causing the unwitting viewer to stare intensely at their screen and listen very very carefully for several minutes, which is funny in itself to the [[Douchebag|prank-player]]), the Flash will suddenly display very [[guro|disturbing]] or [[Pain_series|scary]] images accompanied by a [[earrape|loud scream played at max volume]].  Because the unwitting viewer has already cranked their volume up, their eardrums explode and they inevitably [[piss]] their pants.  Witnessing this will probably cause you too to [[piss]] your pants from the sheer [[lulz]].

Bear in mind, if you ever get [[raped]] by a screamer, have in mind that the [[douchebag|person]] who gave you the link was also raped. That is, after all, the way Screamers go through the [[Internet|tubes]].

== Protips ==

Most of the [[basement dwellers]] now have learned how to avoid these [[Sick Fuck|sick]] pranks. Here are some [[protip|protips]] for you if you're a [[pussy]] and afraid to be [[raped|screamer'd]]:

*If youre watching a video on [[Youtube]], check the fucking comments. If the uploader has disabled them, you might get [[pwned]].
*Videos about [[bullshit]] like subliminal messages are obviously, well, [[bullshit]] and are screamers. 
*If you're playing a game like Where's Waldo, have a mind that Waldo is a [[bastard]] and might [[fuck|prank]] you.
*If it's a .gif that is pretending to be a still image, it's a screamer. No exceptions.
*If you're still [[retarded|not sure about the video (or flash)]], be a [[fag]] and ask your friend to check it out. The results can be both [[lulzy]] and informative.
*And finally, don't be a fucking paranoid [[pussy]]. Even if you get screamer'd, after a week or two it will be [[lol|lulzy]] to remember it.

=== Making a Screamer ===

Being a part of the fad is easy. Most of the [[dumbasses|professional prankers]] obviously use [[Flash]] for making a screamer, but a broke pedophile like [[you]] can even use something as retarded as [[Windows Movie Maker]].

Find a [[goatse|scary image]] that would make people [[shit bricks]]. Most use scary faces. Then, think of the bait for the viewer. Now, every retard can spot a screamer (see above), so you got to think of something even more retarded. For example, make a slideshow of [[mudkip]] pictures. Now, get a loud scream. Put everything in their right places, and if you're not a [[fucktard]], you should now have a screamer. Well done you.

== Most notable ==

Except for those [[Shit|cheesy]] Youtube screamers which just have a badly rendered picture of a skull, screamers are usually so [[Shit|great]] you automatically bear them in mind - either it is so scary you pissed on the chair or it is just plain [[Shit|epic]].

*The Maze Game - the probably most overused screamer, hence the numerous reaction videos on Youtube where the maze is involved. You guide your mouse through a maze. That's it. When you end level 3 the face of that demon [[Loli|girl]] from The Exorcist comes out and screams. That's it. If it doesn't sound so horrifying, [[just google it]]. You'll see. The idea of luring the viewer closer to the screen and getting him/her more concentrated was quickly popularized, therefor fucktons of maze game clones appeared, which follow the same routine, only have a different objective, e.g. [[Virgin|"complete the maze and get Britney Spears naked"]].
*What's Wrong With This Picture - already mentioned in the article earlier, WWWTP is sometimes called the first screamer to be. This may or may not be true, but people who say it is bad are fucking [[retards]]. It just asks you to look into a picture of a [[lol wut|house of some sort]] and find a mistake - what is wrong with it. I suppose I should mention that no matter how long you look there is nothing wrong with it, but you won't have to look long anyway, because in about 30 seconds [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Creepypastaseries.gif this face] comes out with a yell. Then it repeats itself. This one was so popular, it became an actual [[IRL meme]] and at some point it even got to that TV show "America's [[Swap.avi|Funniest Videos]]". It also spawned another line of screamers - "Where's Waldo", which ask you to search for [[Faggot|Waldo]] and end in the usual manner.
*Ghost car - this one was actually created outside of the [[internets]], it was originally a german coffee commercial or something but then some [[Internet Tough Guy|local warriors]] started claiming that it was an car advertisement, so the information is mostly unclear. What is known that it trolled millions, because a screamer on television is obviously [[THE BEST|the greatest]] idea ever. You see trees and [[shit]], and a car drives, then the car hides behind the trees and a [[Wat|zombie comes out]]. While it has a pretty awesome history, it is not as scary as the usual screamer. So go watch it, faggot.
*Subliminal Messages - also a popular one, it was mainly popularized in Albino Blacksheep. Some say it is the scariest around, but this is probably just because it starts [[Mindfuck|fucking with your brain]] before the climax, thus increasing the tension. Also, [[No|everyone]] knows subliminal shit is scary. It shows random images with hidden messages with them, then starts playing some music backwards (which is supposed to be [[Hardcore|demonic]] or something) and [[OMGWTFBBQ|out of nowhere]] appear pictures of [[dead babies]], mummies and other [[Sick Fuck|sick fuckery]]. But still, screamers involving "subliminal" shit are very common, so it gets old quickly.

Wait, why would you need descriptions? Just watch them!
