On a beautiful [[2008|April]] day [[Puerto Rico|Mercedes Herrera]] was found in her closet. Mecrcedes was a [[delicious cake|12 year old girl]] from [[hell|East New York]], [[New York City|Brooklyn]]. She left a suicide note saying that her [[step dad]] wouldn't let her go to her friends house. He didn't allow her to go because it was in <s>her</s> his [[rape|best interest]]. Other [[mom|sources]] say that she was being [[Ben Vodden|bullied at school]]. Not only did they beat her up but "they used to [[Harassment|harass her]], curse at her, call her '[[teenager|train tracks]]' because she had braces, and they used to [[emo|cut her hair]]."

== Response ==
Her [[whore|mother]] [[Trolling IRL|went to the school]] [[Over 9000|more than 20 times]] to [[pussy|complain]] about the bullying. The school denied any involvement because no one cares about minorities.
