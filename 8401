'''Three Wolf Moon''' is a meme sparked when a fucking sweet T-shirt featuring three wolves howling at the moon was discovered on [[Amazon]]. Did I mention this shirt is a chick magnet, and that it can cure cancer?

{{quote|<u>Pros</u>: Fits my girthy frame, has wolves on it, attracts women
<br><u>Cons</u>: Only 3 wolves (could probably use a few more on the 'guns'), cannot see wolves when sitting with arms crossed, wolves would have been better if they glowed in the dark.|Bee-Dot-Govern}}

== The Shirt That Became an Icon ==

Forged in the fires of Mount Doom on the night of the full moon's magic in the far-off lands of [[Soviet Russia]]'s Siberia, Antonia Neshev wove this shirt from the golden fleece of the gold-haired winged ram. The imagery on the front of the shirt was delivered to her in a dream by the Archangel Gabriel. Little did she know that the shirt would become a holy relic and an icon for [[fatty|overweight]], [[mullet]]-wearing, trailer-park-dwelling [[rednecks]] the world over.

In 2009, the Three Wolf Moon aired on [[unfunny|The Office]], making the meme, like many others, less funny because it is now used by tons of [[13-year-old boys|13-year-olds]].

== The Review That Became a Meme ==

When Brian Govern found this shirt on Amazon.com, he knew he had to purchase such a diamond in the rough. Moreover, he had to tell the world of its magic, aphrodisiac, cancer-curing properties. The review he posted to Amazon.com that fateful day sparked a gold rush. What [[shit no one cares about|other magical items]] could be found on sale on Amazon, E-Bay, or lo, even [[Craigslist]] for 15% off? 

It turns out that customers who bought this item also bought [http://theridiculant.metro.co.uk/2009/07/three-kayboard-cat-moon-and-the-internet-did-rejoice.html Keyboard Cats], [http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/05/04/three-jpeg-moon-t-shirt-meta-meta-meta-ironic/ JPEGs], [http://www.80stees.com/products/Full-Moon-Teen-Wolf-T-shirt.asp Teen Wolf], and some [[faggot|fag]] named Worgen from World of Warcraft.
