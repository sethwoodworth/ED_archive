Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes
__NOTOC__
[[Image:MvC2CS.jpg|thumb|Out of all these characters, guess how many of them tourneyfags choose.]]
'''''Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes''''' is a [[not|fun]], [[arcade]] button masher, that isn't suitable for competitive play due to the many unstoppable [[hax|exploits]] that can be repeated mercilessly throughout a match. However, due to the popularity of the Marvel characters, Capcom's inability to produce good original fighting games any more, and the exploits popularized by the [[internet]], this game became very popular among the [[tourneyfag|"Script Kiddies."]]

It was around this time that these players figured out all of the cheap exploits on the internet and decided to [[troll|hoard]] internet forums like shoryuken.com and whine and cry about "Anything Goes in competitive tournaments", because cheating is not important to them as long as they win. [[tourneyfag|(these players would later plague most other video games as well, particularly online games, ruining the experience for everyone else.)]]

Though the game is still popular among the [[tourneyfag|"Script Kiddies,"]] it is only rarely played competitively at legitimate fighting game tournaments, due to the many exploits. The game is featured annually at EVO 2K, one of the smaller, lesser known competitive game tournaments that allow [[Bukkake|"anything goes"]] matches, even seeking out games like Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 and refusing true competitive fighting games like Virtua Fighter 5, due to the fact that it's too easy to [[skill|counter]] cheesy [[copypasta|repetitive]] moves.

It is at EVO 2K, where the same [[tourneyfag|3 players]], who were never heard of before Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, compete annually for the [[aids|grand prize]], utilizing only the top 5 characters and cheapest exploits to try to "out-cheese" each other. These 3 players then go home and hide in the corner of their local arcade, practicing their [[rape|cheap moves]], until the next year, when they resurface to try and claim the prize once again.

Meanwhile, other players play [[Street Fighter 2|real fighting games]].

Marvel has recently ancounced that the game will be re-released as downloadable content for the [[Playstation 3|XBox 360]] and [[Xbox 360|PlayStation 3]] in [[snca|1080p]] [[goatse|HIGH]] [[pixels|DEFINITION]]. With the added ability to play [[interwebz|online]], you can now discuss your [[faggoty|tactics]] with others while you play and can also obtain [[Shit nobody cares about|achievements and trophies]].
