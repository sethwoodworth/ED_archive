Drama remorse
'''Drama remorse''' is the panicked state of mind of one that has realised how [[stupid]] they've made themselves look -- usually because they've [[goatse|over-stretched themselves]] trying to look [[clever]]. Sufferers are usually found deleting [[evidence]] of their [[WikiWar|mistakes]] and trying to promote more favourable frames of reference for evidence they cannot hide. This tends to provide many [[lulz]] on wiki sites or the [[Portal of Evil]], where the evidence can never be truly deleted. It's especially amusing the the latter case, when people regularly post threads in the general forum demanding that the admins delete their posts for them.

== Treatment ==

When a panic attack occurs, it is recommended that the sufferer is immediately relieved by a quick jab to the scrotum, preferably using hard objects like baseball bats. For female sufferers, the application of a [[Don't Taze Me Bro|taser gun]] to the nipples is suggested. Drama remorse can be controlled with treatment. Treatment usually consists of a series of extensive [[BDSM]] therapy and also involves jumping from a the second or third floor of any nearby apartment. For chronic cases, a higher floor may be required (see [[suicide]]). In several cases, brain transplants and gender change surgery have also been proposed.
