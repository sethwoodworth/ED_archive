Ditto
[[Image:dittooo37.png|thumb|dittooooooooooo!]]

Late [[last Thursday]], a ditto appeared in /b/. Chaos struck out, people posted pictures, only to be mimicked by the innocent ditto.

==Characteristics==

It is well known that Dittos are [[whore|rampant]] androgynous [[Pokémon|pokémans]] that love to [[secks|befriend]] [[tits|anything that moves]] regardless of whether it is desired or [[raep|not]].
They can be easily reckognized by their fluffy pinkyness and blank staring dotty eyes. 

This is acceptable because all pokémans are generally [[asking for it]] and enjoy copulating with warmed up [[roman showers|jello]].

However, because this [[Pokémon]] is both androgynous and a shapeshifter, our crack research team is currently investigating whether or not [[LittleCloud]]'s true identity is not a [[Fyiad|dragon]], but in fact a Ditto.

Closely related to the [[dildo]] (and generally used for the same purposes) Ditto's are known for their jelly-like nature and constant happiness.

Ditto has a magical move called [[Copypasta|Transform]]. The only other pokéman that can use it is [[Babyfur|Mew]], but the furries are to busy fapping to Zoroark to give a flying fuck.

Ditto may be a living venerial disease or STD.
