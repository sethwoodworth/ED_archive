Cheryl Shuman
[[Image:CherylHannibal.jpg|center|250px|]]


Cheryl Shuman is a [[batshit]] insane [[YouTube]] vlogger with such a massive case of [[unwarranted self importance]] and so many [[sockpuppets]] she has now been banned from YouTube over 1,000 times. YouTube offenses are generally too boring to actually land someone an article of their very own on our fair wiki, however her overall behavior has escalated beyond YouTube offenses and includes stalking, multiple threats of [[lolsuits]] in which she has created her own [[internet court]] judicial system, and general fuckwittery. She used to work on the fringe of Hollywood, on a par with the guy who provides the portable toilets and since has reinvented herself more times than Cher, with often hilarious and wacky results. Here comes the crazy.

==History==

Cheryl had some minor success in Hollywood in the 80's as a sunglasses fetcher for those superior to her in the entertainment industry, up to and including the coffee bitch. Many of these people still enjoy some success, all of whom have shunned Ms. Schuman because of her psychotic and generally annoying behaviour, and because she is a massive fucking nobody. She gathered some wealth as "Optician to the Stars". Despite not being an actual optician, she still refers to herself as this even though no one has called her for consultation since pre Jurassic Park. Shockingly, the internet is not impressed.

She used to be married to Fox News reporter, [[Phil Shuman]]. Phil hates her now too, and has well and truly stooped to her level, having had almost as many [[sockpuppets]] as she has. Minus 1000 or so.

==YouTube Drama==

As with most YouTubers, Cheryl is ridiculously obsessive and has an obvious personality disorder. Not only is she clearly a sociopath, she's a complete moron too. Her destructive attitude has given her much attention, however admittedly this is mostly from her own sockpuppet accounts.

===Bans===

She has been banned due to actual Terms of Service violations which she has actually committed, and she commited the very same ones in 2008 that got her banned in 2006, however none of this is her fault, it is yours. Common violations that she absolutely did not commit include: 

*Copyright infringement.
*Cheating with dummy accounts.
*Partial nudity.
*Spamming.
*Threatening users.
*Maliciously revealing users' private information.
*Being a huge cunt.


The cheating part? She voted herself up in the [[YouTube]] popularity contest because she thought it would help her get her autobiography published, attract investors for a series of reality shows she had repeatedy pitched to and had rejected by various television networks, and some other fairly inexplicable scheme involving product placement in videos. She is not the only one who has sought to exploit the YouTube system in that way, she just happens to be a consistent, severe failure at it.

===Sockpuppets===

===Illegal DMCA Infringement Complaints===

Cheryl Shuman has sent many illegal DMCA complaints against people's videos on YouTube. These are copyright complaints she sends to get people's videos taken down. Most of these are videos opposing her in some way. Many of these have been resurrected due to successful and legal counter claims sent by the real video owners. 

Here are only some examples of videos which were down and have been brought back:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xxae_lHnmLM The ED Singers video]

Almost every video at [http://www.youtube.com/anticherylvids youtube.com/anticherylvids]

She was trying to get Youtube's 3-strikes suspensions on some Youtube accounts by sending copyright claims on videos such as [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w2GV3ZghjM Welcome to the Internets].

These two profiles are from the early days, still holding reinstated videos:
* [http://www.youtube.com/ellhow youtube.com/ellhow]
* [http://www.youtube.com/CherylDearest youtube.com/CherylDearest]

These, which are in this article: [http://www.youtube.com/user/ueytbdbn youtube.com/user/ueytbdbn] and the "acid attack" videos as well.

===Videos===

*In one of her videos she states that she was paid $1,000,000 - one million dollars from a client of her matchmaking service. This is almost definitely a lie, concocted after someone totally important on YouTube called her broke. A sly retaliation, i'm sure you'll agree.

* In another, she claims she is going to sue [[Google]], and a whole other bunch of people. Not that she's litigious.

*She filed a [[DMCA]] complaint about a video uploaded by YouTube user Ellhow demonstrating how sloppy her cockpuppetry was. It wasn't upheld.

===Ysabella Brave vs. Cheryl Shuman===
[[Image:Csmyspaceninja.jpg|right|thumb|Expert Banned Vlogger Ninja]]
Cheryl's [http://www.youtube.com/CherylShuman90210 CherylShuman90210] YouTube account was suspended after she attempted to launch an unexplainable stalking campaign against another complete and utter nobody [http://www.youtube.com/ysabellabrave Ysabella Brave]. The sychophantic [[retard]] left an incredibly odd ass-kissing post on the nobody's Youtube as seen below, then created a story about Ysabella in which the [[whore|superstar]] apparently created [[irony|millions of sockpuppet accounts]] in order to harrass Shuman, having rejected her ''PR Ninja'' skills. Cheryl claimed that her "private investigator" had traced the sockpuppets "ISP" to Ysabella Brave, adding internet ninja to her already impressive repertoire.

===Lolsuits OTI===

Cheryl Shuman has been known to assign people various internet crime cases. Those who dislike, oppose or confront her are usually e-rrested and inevitably will be going to prison for 5 years. She repeats and emphasizes the 5 year sentence mandate often, again, mainly to her own [[sockpuppets]] in order to reinforce the notion that this is, in fact, [[serious fucking business]]. 

Cheryl's Serious Internet Judicial System works like this: You will hand over your private real life information or she will intimidate your e-friends into giving her your info, you will then sit back whilst she publishes your info on her blog and web sites, and spams it to a few hundred YouTube users. Luckily you can work out retarded plea deals with imaginary attorneys, sign perverted fetish confessions, and agree that you got convicted to Internet Prison for 5 years.
Apparently, when anyone commits slander on the internet by commenting negatively on her videos (definitely not libel), it's called a <b>tort</b>. Many people keep their torting private, mainly doing it outdoors or in a bathroom equipped with a sturdy fan. Anyone who torts her will be convicted to 5 years in prison, it being a criminal charge.The case will be officially tried and documented in her blog. Shuman will also spam your blog-trial to multiple profiles and videos on YouTube in order to put in on [[serious business|public record]]

'''Fun Fact:''' Cheryl Shuman is used as an example in [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]'s stalker article.

== David VS. Cheryl Shuman ==
For videos on this subject, David's YouTube profile is [http://www.youtube.com/anticherylvids anticherylvids]. His alternate [[YouTube can be found [http://www.youtube.com/CaptainCrotch here] under the name CaptainCrotch. 

Cheryl called David on the phone, October 14, 2007 and left a message informing him that he had confessed to being Uptownmostly, something he had, in fact not done because he was, in fact, not Uptownmostly. She also informed him he was YahWeh at [[LiveVideo]], a fact he openly admits, it being his public [[LiveVideo]] and all. The account he supposedly made the grand confession to was SamanthaAJones, one of Cheryl's sockpuppets. Once David received this voicemail, he went on the hunt for Cheryl's lawyers, private investigators and law enforcement agents. To date he has been unsucessful in his search.

The voicemail in question:

A few more confessions on [http://www.youtube.com/Cherylshumantriumphs Cherylshumantriumphs] from David Shuman in his kind attempt to help her super sleuthishness:

<i>I am [http://www.youtube.com/Ilene888 Ilene888]<br>
I am [http://www.youtube.com/cherylshumanspanties cherylshumanspanties]<br>
I am [http://www.youtube.com/Jackkline Jackkline]<br>
I am [http://www.youtube.com/cherlyisafraud cherlyisafraud]<br>
Damn straight I am [http://www.livevideo.com/Yahweh Yahweh]</i>

Shuman decided to retaliate in a mature and dignified manner, thus she unleashed the fucking fury and plastered his name, address, telephone number and family information on every profile of every website she is affiliated with. This is the woman with literally hundreds of accounts just on YouTube.

[[Image:Csoutglasses.jpg|right|thumb|Banned from that city too]]
* She has had real life court cases against Steven Seagal, none of which she has won. One case was to get a restraining order against him. See: [[Irony]]

*There was a real life trial in late October 2007 where Cheryl Shuman (who is in Ohio) was trying to get a restraining order against a man named Mario Nitrini (who is not in Ohio). She has also named some sockpuppets after him, lucky guy. See: [[retarded]]

Four YouTube users went and sat through the Nitrini hearing, Cheryl didn't bother to attend. Here is a video uploaded to YouTube by one of those 4 people:

<center><youtube>T-ZshcI5UDQ</youtube></center>

The judge threw out the case 'with prejudice'. That means Cheryl cannot attempt to  reopen the case.
<pre>
Case Number: ES011754
CHERYL SHUMAN VS.﻿ MARIO GEORGE NITRINI III

Filing Date: 09/05/2007
Case Type: Civil Harassment (General Jurisdiction)
Status: Dism Lack of Prosecution-Petn o/c 10/29/2007
</pre>

Mario isn't the only person who Cheryl claims is stalking her. [[Batshit insane]] fucktards are the only people in the world who don't really have any stalkers, however hard they try and convince you otherwise. 

===OMG Acid Attack===

[[Image:Cheryl shuman youtube.jpg|right]]

At one point, Shuman uploaded videos of herself with seemingly severe burns all over her face. She named several YouTube users, and described a brutal acid attack against her. To some it seemed like the endless threats and online vitriol had reached a violent and unexpected head... Were it not for the fact that this is the age of cosmetic surgery and a chemical peel is as easy to spot as a ragged old attention whore with nothing better to do.
