LED Ethernet Cables
{{pixpls}}

Simply owning [[LED Ethernet Cables]] makes you [[fucking]] [[leet]]. Using them puts you on par with infamous personalities such as [[Kevin Mitnick]] and [[weev]]. I have pink led cables how about you?

Unfortunately most people who buy these cables spend most of their time fapping alone to [[jailbaitgallery.com]]

== Where to get LED Ethernet Cables ==
[[LED Ethernet Cables]] aren't actually sold anywhere. You have to make them yourself. This is easily accomplished by going to the store and buying the most expensive cables you can get, and taking them home and gaying them up using the following steps:

#Purchase cables or borrow some from your friend with no intention of giving them back and then pissing in their sink STEVE.
#Completely ruin them by <del>stripping</del> burning off segments of the plastic insulation.
#Cut a wire and reconnect it using an led.
#Repeat steps as necessary until you have lots of leds on your ethernet cable.

'''''[[protip|Bonus points]]:''' For an added effect attach leds to different wires.''
