The [[User:MysteryBot|MysteryBot]] is teh most powerful sysop on ED.

Created by notable [[ED]] [[sysop]] [[User:WhiteMystery|WhiteMystery]]'' (notable for the fact that he actually does useful things for the site)'', [[User:MysteryBot|MysteryBot]] does all the things that the other [[sysop|sysops]] should be doing, but are too lazy and/or busy fapping to [[jailbait]] or getting drunk and crying over their busted mac laptop. <small>(Fuck you. -Yirimyah</small>

NOTE : It is possible to troll [[User:MysteryBot|MysteryBot]], but anyone doing so would incur the wrath of the [[banhammer]] like [[noone]] else has ever felt it, as the [[fail|incapacitation]] of [[User:MysteryBot|MysteryBot]] would lead to the [[Special:Listadmins|other sysops]] actually having to [[shit nobody cares about|do some work]].

[[User:WhiteMystery|WhiteMystery]] is currently developing [[User:MysteryBot|MysteryBot]] and adding mysterious and enigmatic [[hax|advanced functionality]], but whenever he asks other sysops to make suggestions for functions he is met with only [[lie|useless]] but [[lulz|amusing]] ones instead of anything actually productive.  The most effective response when [[User:WhiteMystery|WhiteMystery]] asks for suggestions for anything, is to tell him to [[get on irc fgt]] as it is a well known [[fact]] that he finds [[IRC]] both [[Matt Crimmins|frightening and confusing]].
