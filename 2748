'''Evilzug''' is like the George Costanza of the [[internets]] in that they both did something great [[at least 100]] years ago but have since failed to produce any [[lulz]] whatsoever in anything they do.  Evilzug has slowly descended over the years from the creator of one of the greatest [[flash]] videos ever made before that medium was taken over by [[furfags]] and [[otaku]] [[basement dwellers]] to actually creating and working for [[neopets]], which is the internets equivalent of lounge singing.

What evilzug is best known for is the flash video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFvhHL8rkNY workit], and even though he has his own [[yewt00b]] account[http://www.youtube.com/user/evilzug], he's too busy filling it up with screenshots of shitty warioware on his gameboy to bother putting up the only thing he did that people give a shit about. This was a full blown [[old meme]] and can be found on several shitty websites like [[albinoblacksheep]] and [[newgrounds]], aka the rusting shitbin of the internet. He had a couple of subsequent flash videos that were mildly amusing, but this all tapered off by the end of 2001. Here is [http://www.evilzug.com/stuff/hamster/ an example] of how ancient and [[lame]] his flash work was, you may recognize the [[hamster]], this image was stolen by Diedre Lecarte from evilzug's site to use as part of the hampsterdance.. [[lol]]

== Downward Spiral ==
After this 5 second cumstain of good material came 8 years of [[shit]]. Some is showcased on his old crappy website [http://www.evilzug.com evilzug.com]. Or if yer really brave check out his [[blog]] [http://www.scatteredgenius.com scatteredgenius.com] where you'll find everything his sad mind ever came up with under such categories as "[[Boobies]], Gross, Haxoring, [[Meme]], [[Ninjas]], [[Pirates]]..." aka anything that has had any kind of internet following whatsoever.  He's also one of the personalities on [[endgameradio]][http://www.endgameradio.com], what never heard of it? Thats ok, [[Noone]] has!
