James Fagan

'''James Fagan''' (more like Fag-an, amirite?) is a [[liberal]] [[Democrat]], naturally from [[Massachusetts]], who gained fame recently for his angry rant in favor of the complete [[ruination]] of the victims of [[pedophilia|pedophiles]]. This has gone on to create instant drama anywhere it has gone, including the internet.

==The setup==
The Massachusetts Legislature was working on passing a law that imposed a 25 year mandatory minimum [[goatse|goatseation]] [[in the ass]] by [[Bubba]] for convicted [[pedophiles]]. Most people don't care what happens to disgusting pedos, but Fagan is a Jew, and spurred on by his good friends [[Irish282]] and [[DynaCatlovesme]], Fagan went on to give a lulz-ridden diatribe on the floor of the legislature about what he would do to child victims who go to their parents:

{{quote|Let me tell you why it's so wrong...It's so wrong because in these situations . . . that 6-year-old is going to sit in front of me, or somebody far worse than me and I'm going to [[rape|rip them apart]]. I'm going to make sure that the rest of their life is [[ruined]]. That when they're 8 years old they [[roman shower|throw up]]; when they're 12 years old, they won't sleep. When they're 19 years old they'll have nightmares and they'll [[nerd|never have a relationship with anybody]]. And that's not because I'm a [[nice guy]]. That's because when you're in court, and you're defending somebody's liberty, and you're facing a mandatory sentence of those draconian proportions, you have to do every single thing you can do on behalf of your client. That is your obligation as a trial lawyer.|James Fagan}}

Fagan's point, which was made in possibly the most hilarious way possible, was that if the mandatory minimum law was passed, defense attorneys would be more likely to do anything, including [[troll|emotionally scar]] children who are testifying, in order to get their clients off. While not an invalid point necessarily, it is still [[retarded]], for a few reasons. First of all, most defense attorneys agree that [[harassment|harassing]] children on the witness stand is not something that will make juries like you or your client, but rather has the effect of making you look worse than [[Hitler]]. The 25 year minimum sentence was created so that if the [[pedos]] actually survived prison, they would be too old for [[rape]]. And for some reason, the legislature actually found it to be appropriate for a guy with a direct interest in the legislation to actually talk about and vote on it, the very highlight of ethical standing in a representative democracy.

On the other hand, Fagan could have just said the entire thing for the [[lulz]], and could come out with a statement that simply says "[[lol]] jk."

==Reaction on the internet==
Reaction on the internet was understandably mixed. [[Fox News]] and [[conservatives]] issued a [[Islam|fatwa]] on Fagan; most [[Democrats]] condemned the remarks while acknowledging the point he was trying to make; the most hardcore [[liberal]] [[pussies]] and the [[ACLU|ACLJew]] agreed with Fagan and started [[fapping]] to Mumia and [[Che]].

Perhaps most hilariously, Fagan's [[dox]] were dropped nearly everywhere he was even mentioned. During the process of discovering his docs, however, it was noticed that nearly every single one of his community activites [http://www.mass.gov/legis/member/jhf1.htm involved children in some way] and would provide excellent opportunities for [[pedophilia|grooming]]. There were some who speculated that Fagan was not just a pedophile enabler, but a full blown [[pedo]] himself.

To add fuel to the fire, after the controversy erupted, a [http://www.bostonherald.com/news/opinion/letters/view/2008_06_26_In_defense_of_Fagan/ letter to the editor] was printed in the Boston Herald entitled "In Defense of Fagan" written by a certain Joel Pentlarge, who called himself the head of the "Criminal Justice Policy Coalition." It was summarily pointed out that Joel Pentlarge was actually a convicted [[pedophile]] himself who had been caught fondling [[shota|young boys]].
