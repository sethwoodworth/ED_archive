[[Image:Lolly.jpg|thumb|Although he's not a mod anymore, he's still happy to solve problems of other tartlets. His [[Fellatio|fans]] approve too.]]

{{deviantart|Lolly|Lolly}}, known as {{deviantart|lllo0o0olll|lllo0o0olll}} [[at least 100 years ago|in the good ol' days]], was a deviantART core admin until [[Last Thursday|last Wednesday]]. His duty was to spread lies his boss, {{deviantart|Spyed|Spyed}} makes up for him, and to [http://ndifference.deviantart.com ban] [http://badfurday.deviantart.com whoever] [http://surrealist-geek.deviantart.com disagreed] [http://cageybutterfly.deviantart.com with] [http://shadowgamers.deviantart.com him], even if it's done in a mature way, and without any [[fag|insults]] and/or [[trolling]] (Although it must be said when he finally put the banhammer down on "arch troll" and "leader of the emo" [http://ndifference.deviantart.com ndifference]there was much rejoicing in Fella'$ Faggotry Lounge, where lolly/spyed/realitysquared partake of frequent buttseks while chix0r stands by and twirls her mustache).

Back in the day he was a "Tour de force" on the forums when trolling newbies was "the thing". His [[troll]] attitude is also proved by [http://surrealist-geek.com/ this backup of a journal and its replies]. Anyone wishing to see his troll attitude just has to use the handy search and look at his threads started back in the day.

== Accurate Depiction of Lolly ==

[[Image:LOLLY_ACCURATE.jpg|center|Obviously, dxd is an ass-licking whore of epic proportions.]]

== Fun Facts ==

[[Image:Lolly_is_a_slut.PNG|thumb|Yeah.]]

[[Image:Unlimited power.JPG|thumb|right|His power level is [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND|over nine thousand]], but his modesty level is down at zero.]]

[[Image:Lollyportfoliopromise.png|thumb|right|FULL OF FALSE PROMISES!!]]

[[Image:Mostawesomebuttkiss_1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Autofellatio|Asslickers]] can get away with this but don't YOU do that or you get the [[banhammer]]!]]

[[Image:Lolly_contest.jpg|thumb|Translation: If you think dA has cheap prizes, then you can GTFO.]]

[[Image:DevianTART.jpg|thumb| definitely here for the art, that's for sure]]

*<strike>Lolly, despite what the terms of service claims, reads your notes on a daily basis, as proved by [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/11836223/405180017 this comment].</strike> HAHA DISREGARD THIS, I FAIL AT READING (AND ALSO SUCK COCKS)

*Lolly hides under a clown mask, because his face is too ugly to be seen. Some say he is the evil twin of the [[Pillow Angel]]. His face has been seen only once, and it was during the [[retard|Special Olympics]].

*During the [[Guruubii|ACCIDENT RETARD]] case, Lolly promised that something would be done against [[Guruubii]] (see the note screencapped in the [[Guruubii]] article for proof). Of course, nothing was done. Point proven: Lolly is just here to spread lies, but he has strictly no power on dA.

*Lolly hates [[Anonymous|4channers]] and will ban whoever uses [[memes]] on deviantART, most of the time without any reason. Unless, of course, the person sucks his [[E-penis]] and/or happens to be [http://lolly.deviantart.com/journal/11709807/ Lolly himself.]

[[Image:Baby Ad.jpg|thumb|This meme isn't funny anymoar, thanks to you, retard.]]

*He changed his name from lllo0o0olll because he *finally* realized that some people would have [[tl;dr|difficulty spelling it.]]

*His current icon is a gift from the [[furry]] neoikeia which earned her the position of gallery director.

*Lolly was once permabanned for being a [[troll]] in the forums but was reinstated after having secks with the adminz.

*Rumor has it that Lolly is the true identity of mctbone, a troll who plagued the forums during deviantART's failed [[shit|V2]].

*Lolly is notorious for [http://comments.deviantart.com/2/25550/395499606 false promises and failed deadlines].

*Lolly is an overweight, alcoholic redneck with a lazy eye which serves to make him look as stupid as he actually is.  [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/4798083/ Just look at this asshole]. If that ain't a redneck, nothin' is!

*Lolly has left dA!! He removed his staff symbol in favor of nothing. He posted a [http://lolly.deviantart.com/journal/20049936/ tl;dr journal] announcing his leave, although it has been predicted he will come back [[Last Thursday|next thursday]] and say this was all a joke.

*Lolly was last seen [http://lolly.deviantart.com/journal/27565858/ begging for money on the inetz] so he could slink back into his shithole in North Bumblefuck and secks up hiz goatz.

[[Image:Soapbox lol.JPG|thumb|If people even use lol threads to complain, then maybe something IS wrong with the dAdministration?]]

== '''''[[PROTIP]]:''''' ==
If you are on deviantART and if $Lolly comments on your userpage, deviations, or journal, do not reply. His only purpose is to [[troll|troll and bait]] people into replying so he can find a pretext to [[B&]] them. [[Autofellatio|Licking his ass]] might save you though, as proven by the many [[buttsex|love]] comments permanently flooding his {{deviantart|lolly|dA page}}.

*http://comments.deviantart.com/4/289063/404931136

Comments like this will get ya banned unless you post them to [[Autofellatio|asslick]] Lolly or one of his buds. It might also get you a position in the staff!

==Art Critic==
Let it also be known that Lolly has a high standard for art, if you don't [[Blowjob|agree]] with him, he'll retort that [http://comments.deviantart.com/2/31138/493431078 your art] isn't of a [http://comments.deviantart.com/2/31138/493149710 high enough quality] for him to acknowledge you, and once more skate around the question at hand. Well, Lolly, let's look in the mirror, shall we?
