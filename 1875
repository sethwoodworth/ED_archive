Cry moar

'''Cry moar''' is the response that people on [[Livejournal]] typically use in order to respond to [[butthurt]] people, mostly on communities such as {{lj|roleplaysecrets}} and [http://community.livejournal.com/fandomsecrets fandomsecrets] when their opinion is [[stupid|unpopular]] or just plain [[dumb]]. Another term is "get over yourself", but most people think it sounds more [[badass|cool]] to send people [[Deleting_your_LiveJournal|packing]].

It is actually meant as sort of a schadenfreude term, that your target's tears only make your [[penis]] grow larger.

==Origin==
Its origin is [http://gravelyroasting.livejournal.com/1038.html?thread=9998#t9998 a thread] in a [[Livejournal Roleplay|roleplay]] journal for the community {{ljcomm|discedo}}, though a lot of other [[roleplay]] communities like to brag that they were the first to coin the term in their [[fail|ooc chatrooms]]. They're just [[fags]] though.

==Proper usage==

To properly use the term, it should be limited to these occasions:

*When someone is [[fag|literally crying]]
*When someone is figuratively crying
*When you are trolling someone and they try to get their friends to gang up on you
*When your mom doesn't have enough money to pay the bills
*When your friend's cat dies
*When [[Chris-chan]] gets his Sonichu necklace taken
*When someone threatens [[suicide]] over an ED article

If you feel bad for the target, [[DO IT FAGGOT|it is best not to tell them to cry moar]], as it is [[pussy|demeaning]].
