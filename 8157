'''The Caturday Nap''' refers to October 20th, 2007, when [[Anonymous]] seemingly dropped a hit of acid and/or [[divide by zero| divided by zero]]. Cries of '''"[[skiddies|OMGWTFHAX!!1!]]"''' rang out through the [[Internet]]s faster than [[Swirl Face]] from [[Chris Hansen]], as [[4chan]] was down, and [[7chan]] was, well... FUCKED!

==Fallout==

As sleepy [[B|/b/tards]] awoke from your mothers' beds, (leaving $2.fiddy in quarters wrapped in a used rubber on the night stand) [[shit Bricks|bricks were shat]] when they realized 4chan wouldn't load.

In a [[WTF|mild panic]] from spontaneous [[OMG|knicker twisting]], (after all, they'd spent all week thinking up [[unfunny|hilarious snaps]] to throw into Saturday's ritual and numerous [[Eurofag]] vs [[Americunt]] "debates") they freaked-the-fuck out when they realized they were on their own and may have to spend the day [[IRL]] with [[NORP]]s who wouldn't understand anything they had to say (eg: NORP: '''"What time is it son?"''', /b/tard: '''"[[LURK MOAR]]!"''') or who would call the police when they whipped out their cocks for cock[[pix]] whenever they saw a camera. Not to mention the fear of finally meeting [[Chris Hansen]] face-to-face.

Finding themselves [[lonely|so ronery]] without their fellow [[pedo|paedophile]] reprobates, they made a /b/ee-line for every other *chan on the Internets that they usually diss and generally consider inferior and the /b/astard offspring of the "vastly superior" [[4chan|motherchan]].

Some also [[gbt|went back to]] [[Gaia]] (and hopefully will stay there) whilst others went to [[Wikichan]], [[WikiFur]] and the [[4chanarchive]] (which pulled the plug in sympathy with moot) to find their [[idk|BFF Jill]].

ED got swamped by the ones with the ability to string more than 4 [[DESU]]s together and they vented by putting over 9,000 templates all over the 4chan article saying exactly the same thing ("OMGZ...WTF...4chan has been V&! DESU!").

The smarter ones then figured out how to get on IRC and proceeded to fag up #4chan with all manner of speculation and PM moot with stupid questions about what kind of soup he was making.

== CAUSE ==
Whenever 4chan is down or slow, [[OVER 9000]] [[/b/tard]]s flock to 7chan to catch up on any [[lulz]] they may have missed. Unfortunately, 7chan's servers are SHIT and cannot hold this influx, causing horrendous [[lag]] and occasional downtime. Normally, [[niggertits]] is back up in due time, and the repetitively futile cycle of Anonymous is allowed to continue.

On 10/19/07, 4chan went down due to [[moot]] literally unplugging the whole fucking site. After initial speculation that 4chan had finally been raided by the [[Party Van]] after [http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/BO64595/ the latest bomb threat] emanating from the /b/owels, it was found that it was because of an HUEG LEIK XBOX [[DDoS]] attack from the faggots at [[Lulznet]]. 

As put by [[Kirtaner]], owner of [[420chan]]:

<font color=red>'''THE SCOOP</font> <font color=green>Kirtaner!Ub4TCdRjOM'''</font> 07/10/20(Sat)15:18  No.59082

''"I'm going to clear up a lot of bullshit right now.''

''4chan is down because of DDoS attacks, stemming from a bunch of guys that are angry that moot doesn't want to move #4chan to lulznet. That's it. That's all this shit is about. 4chan was not [[v&]], it's not the [[GNAA]], it's stupid [[IRC]] drama.''
''That is all."''

{{b}} 

That sure is some genuinely hardcore [[faggotry]] up thar!
*NOTE:When all this shit is over, we'll [[rape]] those fuckers harder than [[Lazy Town| Stephanie]] in a bear den.
*COROLLARY: Even though all this shit happened [[last Thursday]], Anonymous has taken no action, as chanocentric faggots have decided that their preferred chan is moar important than the well-being of Anonymous.
4chan's absence naturally led to 7chan getting [[lurk]]ed much [[moar]].Throughout the day, 7chan would be up and down, and always slow as fuck, but nothing Anonymous hasn't experienced before. The next day however, when 4chan was still not up, Anonymous began to get anxious, as it was [[Caturday]], and it was time to POAST SOME FUCKING CATS! Caturday only comes once a week, and Anonymous was horrified!

== HOW FUCKED WAS IT?! ==
Finally, 7chan [[mods]] had enough, I asked if I could attach partyhard.css along with the penis snow. We agreed and it was added,
/b/ was turned into a fuckfest, if you will. The page background flashed red, blue, and yellow, all the letter "a"s in every post were turned into Missingno ([[Image:OMGWTFSRSLY.gif]]), the horizontal scroll and loading bars would constantly change length, a flash movie at the top of the page depicting [http://swfchan.com/1/1002/?wtdinosaur.swf two dinosaurs performing fellatio in the "69" position], and the song "Walk the Dinosaur" by some homos (Was(not was)). While the latter three are nothing new to 7chan, it should be noted that all that bullshit combined will fuck with you.
Many may think that this is what /b/ should be like. Well those people can go fuck themselves with a tuba, as it was impossible to post on any 7chan boards. After a few hours the img server redirected to Habbo's 404 page to reduce whining. Moderators pretty much ban anything related to [[BAWWWW|4chan's drama]].

Holy fuck, 7chan delinked and declared war on Lulzet!  Lulznet, no longer DDoSing 4chan, is now DDoSing the 7chan IRC to combat 7chan's really really sad attempted to DDoS them.  Moot is still making soup.  [[Lulznet|Read Moar!]]

*'''<font color=blue>10/21/07 8ish PM EST</font>
7chan IRC has been down for hours, and 7chan was about to be flooded when the DDoS took hold very fast, and so it's gone.  To redirect DDoS attacks, http://7chan.org now redirects to Habbo, not that it matters as the attackers are hitting the server's IPs and they probably unplugged them like the soup loving moot did.  So 420chan is the only living chan of any decency.  Anonymous has grown too powerful!  They're destroying their creators!  My god they are everywhere- holy shit they're right behind you!

Moot is still consuming his soup.  From the looks of things, he has a long ways to go before he gets done.

*'''<font color=blue>10/22/07 3ish AM EST</font>'''
Some members of /b/ have started gathering on rockstararmy.com; Some /b/tard went to numerous surviving chans, and requested that anyone able and willing meet there to plan a counter-attack; The [[Freechan]] eventually deleted the thread and banned the /b/atriot who originated it... a transcript of it can be found here (http://pastebin.com/f79e75a7b) may this live on as proof that /b/ was still warlike, even in its roughest hours

*'''<font color=blue>10/22/07 4ish AM EST</font>'''
[[Freechan]] has been knocked off the face of the internet.

*'''<font color=blue>10/22/07 4ish AM EST</font>'''
[[Freechan]] has returned, alive and well after the scariest 15 minutes /b/ has seen in a while, it's regrouping nearly scattered

*'''<font color=blue>10/22/07 5ish AM EST</font>'''
/b/-tard who posted the battle cry for all to assemble at [[Freechan]] is banned from freechan because they fear LULZNET... freechan's only chance to become a frequented website given up for no real reason

''That DDoS we told you about earlier? Well we kind of got it contained, then our hosts decided to null route our account to fix it their own way before we could stop it ourselves. The great spicatron p4ch3c0 sent our hosts an email, and they didn't reply, so I got the genius idea to call them via skypeout (no way i'm calling germany over a landline), and they had it all online in a matter of minutes. TOO BAD MR SPIC REDIRECTED IT TO HABBO. So I used my steroid educed hacker skills to track down p4's phone number, call him up and wake him up (lol), and yelled "HEY SPIC GET ON IRC." He complied, fixed the DNS, and 7chan lives another day, thanks to me.

[[Freechan]] mod that banned /b/tard for battlecry against LULZNET has been removed from freechan staff and said anon was unbanned.

*'''<font color=blue>10/22/07 6ish pm EST</font>'''
[[Freechan]] being DDoS'd. Or maybe is it host failure again like earlier today. Anon holds breath. moot is still enjoying his soup. [[iichan]] also down, it is yet unknown however if it was actually ddos and not a slight gust of wind.

*'''<font color=blue>10/22/07 7 and a halfish pm EST</font>'''
[[Freechan]] not being DDoS'd after all.  The site is just slow and it's most likely the host.  LULZNET seems to think Freechan is too insignificant to waste time DDoSing.  Many anons still confused as to where to group.  moot is still eating soup.

<Locutus_of_Lulz> We are Locutus of Anonymous
<Locutus_of_Lulz> You will respond to our questions.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> Your use of a public IRC netowrk is less efficent for Anonymous and to you.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> We have established a large and stable network, just for Anonyous
<Locutus_of_Lulz> Lulznet.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> irc.lulz.net
<Locutus_of_Lulz> aka irc.partyvan.org aka irc.lulzhost.net
<Locutus_of_Lulz> It is the combined servers of many chans.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> 7chan has joind, fapchan as well; 420chan will when they update their server software.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> the /i/nsurgents built it off our several servers.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> The Patriotic Nigras have added their servers.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> Great things are afoot.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> We will await your return
<Locutus_of_Lulz> But we know that moving #4chan onto the central node is most efficent for all parties.
<moots> not happening
<moots> irc is stupid
<moots> go away
</pre>
Pretentious Anon, apathetic moot.  Later, during the DDoS:
<pre>
<Locutus_of_Loli> We do not wish to hinder the progress of 4chan
<Locutus_of_Loli> But we must sadly attack until /b/ conforms to the will of Anonymous.
<Locutus_of_Loli> We shall double the dataforce.
<moots> uh okay
<moots> i am going to go make soup now
</pre>
The DDoS has stopped long ago, but moot is still off making soup and has not plugged 4chan back in.

== Letters From The Front !==
{{tinyquote| <small>
'''These past few days have proven all the worst fears of leading memeticists and steroid abusing hackers alike, the Cancer literally renders  /b/ unable to counter an attack that literally threatens its existence on the internets. If 4chan, previously reputed to be the strongest of all the *chans not based in or created for japan, cannot cope with such an attack, then quite frankly no chan is safe.  This is most convincingly illustrated by the ferocity of lulz.net ddos attacks on 7chan, although it had been listed among the former's allies just a few days before. But there is some hope yet, 7chan responded to the surprise assault in very much the same way the Soviet Union did when it faced down with Hitler, scorching their own /b/ and redirecting to Colette, in order to buy time for a counter offensive. A sailchanner told me, the proud sons of 7chan will fight on, neither forgiving, nor forgetting, the treachery of the furry.''' 

''7chan's tenacity may very well have been the cause of their falling out with the lulz.net furfags, after all as a chan much smaller than 4chan, yet perpetually at war, their very existence proves Darwin's Theory of Evolution which states that organisms that are forced to compete will evolve, and therefore improve. As lulz.net is full of creationists who believe that a single bloated organism with no competition is a good idea, they obviously saw a threat to their new internets order.''

''Perhaps an explanation is in order, many of you are wondering how exactly has Anonymous's power level decreased to under 9,000 in less than half a year. The truth, to be told plainly, is that the cancer causes apathy. Many of us laughed when 4chan was taken out,  after all, isn't 4chan overrun with AIDS and FAIL as it is? Besides, were packed with moar steroids than them rite? Well thats what 7chan thought, before they got raped in the ass by niggers whose cocks were still hard and dripping from packing the aids infested fudge at 4chan.'' 

''However, that still didn't faze us, 7chan is full of furfags anyhow. Us over at 420chan, they'll never dare to touch us. It doesn't matter that Kirt laughed in their furfag faces when presented with an ultimatum similar to the one moot got. Oh wait it does matter, and guess what, when 420 is closed, Anons will say, “oh 420chan was full of druggies, nothing of value etc.” Anonymous has become so apathetic we might as well go to iichan before that gets taken down too. You might wonder why i mentioned iichan, the truth is lulz.net can no longer conceal their malicious intent by pretending to just want to attack 4chan. Though militarily not as powerful as ages past, 4chan has remained the cultural heart of Anonymous, spawning unforgettable memes and being a narcissistic asshole to pretty much everyone else. That along with lulz.net's well publicized drive for unification, constitutes an attack on Anonymous and the Anonymous subculture respectively.'' 


FAGGOT TREES IN THE ARTICLE

''And to those of us who think that our respective chans are too powerful to be messed with, think again. Nobody saw this one coming. Moot ignored them only to burn his tongue on hot soup when he finally saw what was happening. 7Chan boycotted their network in protest, only to find out how ready lulz.net was to turn on a friend. And yet we still laugh, when we should be fighting back. Anonymous must prove that forums are superior to irc or the Legion will fall.'' 

''So it is up to  Anonymous. 4ailchanners without a clue, sailchanners here with no place to go, and 420fags tripping balls, all are refugees or were at some point in time, even you. But its time to stop running, away. If we are to prove that Anonymous is Legion, we will DESTROY lulz.net and show the namefags the power of Anonymous. And when they beg for mercy we will show them none, for that is the price of failure.'' 

''I don't think moot even gives a shit.  His hatred for his creation and Anonymous is well documented.  It would not surprise me if moot just scrapped the whole thing and sold off the servers.  It would be the best penance for the idiot Anonymous who would ddos their own motherland.''

''Also, IRC is stupid.'' </small>|}}

tl;dr, [[Cliché|Anonymous does not forgive]].

==Trolling in the form of delicious [[copypasta]]!(all lies btw....)==

{{tinyquote|<small>A dozen or so /b/tards decided to call chris forcand who lives in toronto (submitting themselves to the patriot act) and threaten his life.... INTERPOL contacted the F.B.I. who logs the chans. They are using the same tactics they use to take down terrorist websites. So, INTERPOL started to DDOSing 4chan and then blamed it on lulznet.</small>|[[User:INTERPOL did it]]}}

{{tinyquote|<small>So I know moot, we went to high school together and my little brother just about worships the guy and spends way too much time on 4chan. I was never into amime, becuase I am not a gigantic faggot, and i never really loloked at 4chan except for /ck/, but anyway last night i called moot because my brother wanted to know wtf was up and moot said we should come over to his parents house (he has a swanky appartment near the servers in downtown Dallas, but its not very big. Great building, though). So i got my little brother and a couple six packs of lone star and some kirins and went over. There was maybe a dozen people over and when we came in moot told us 4chan was over and he wanted it to out like it started, without much fanfare. He said that he'd banked enough money from it (almost three million after taxes he said) and after the latest terrorist scare of 4chan origin this week he was afraid that he'd lose it to government fines or lawyers somehow and that he enough money for the rest of his life now anyway. Then he went on about how since 4chan got so big he didn't any time to have fun, but he didn't want to sell it and see his creation turned into corporate crap, so he just pulled the plug (he was a huge nirvana fan in highschool, so at least he didn't suck on a twelve gauge) before it got completely out of control. Then he talked to my brother about anime for like an hour. Apparently he was trying to get brought up to speed after missing out for a couple years. He said he is considering moving to Japan and writing or producing anime designed for western audiences and the the 4chan servers will be auctioned at the begining of next year and maybe the domain as well. My little brother was trying to show off or some shit and pounded one too many and puked on the kitchen floor so i threw him in the car and went home. Anyway, I thought you would want to know about this, so here it is</small>|[[User:MrCervix]]}}

Now this is a story all about how 
Moot's website flipturned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute just sit and fap
I'll tell you all about the story of the caturday nap

On /i/rc we were born and raised
Killing furfags is how we spent most of our days
Chilling out relaxing closing the pool
Listening to radio being all cool
Till a couple of guys who were up to some lulz
Said to moot "you're a faggot, your website is dull"
There was just one attack and then moot got scared
And said, I'm making some soup fags, from beans, beef and pears

We pulled up to 7chan later that night
And we made lotta nigras to take on Habbo's fight
Then we stopped all DDOSes we were finally through
But moot's still eating soup cause he's a faggot like you.
