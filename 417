Amipregnant
[[Image:Pregnancy test instructions.png|frame|This is just in case your pregnancy test doesn't come with instructions]]
A notorious sink-hole for sex [[newbies]].

Amipregnant ostensibly exists "to help you understand your body and what is happening to it."  It is truly difficult to try and encapsulate just what makes Amipregnant special - it is ''gestalt''; more than the sum of its parts. (Which are [[iworshipsatin|fat girls]] who, at the age of twelve, just lost their virginity)


== Users ==
The people who post in Amipregnant fall into two categories:
*Those who believe it is their duty as women to help women.  These righteous crusaders dedicate their valuable time to determining whether or not you might be pregnant based on [http://www.livejournal.com/community/amipregnant/467909.html whatever ridiculously irrelevant information you give them].
*Those who need help because they [http://community.livejournal.com/amipregnant/1285678.html sniff paint]. [http://www.livejournal.com/community/amipregnant/407729.html Seriously].

We can understand what the [[vaginal warrior]]s of Amipregnant deal with on a daily basis through this excerpt from the community's userinfo:
{{quote|If you are experiencing extreme pain and/or [[heavy unexplained bleeding]], do not post - go to the emergency room or call 911 immediately.|apparently, people do need to be told this}}

== Elitists ==
Amipregnant's [http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=amipregnant userinfo] reveals that it is staffed by elitist [[fascists]] who disallow any opinions other than "Yes, you're pregnant" and "No, you're probably not".  In addition they disallow fundamental freedoms such as [[drama]], [[harassment]], and [[netspeak]].

They also expect you to thank each and every person who responds to your post.

== Trolling ==
Amipregnant recently shut its doors to the amateur troll -- posts are moderated, and the number of [[moderator]]s has been increased.  In addition to this, the community now has strict posting guidelines so that posters do not simply ramble on [http://www.livejournal.com/community/amipregnant/676554.html about their erect nipples].

As a result, trolling opportunities exist only as expertly disguised parodies, or simply joining the community and telling everyone -- regardless of circumstance - that they're pregnant. (You will be banned for this, despite it conforming precisely to the rules stated in the userinfo)

== Recent Drama ==
In October 2005, the fat middle aged Jew moderator removed the original founder of the community from the moderating team.

As with any good drama, a number of [[LJ Abuse]] reports were filed on both sides.

== Am I Pregnant? ==
[[Image:10weekold4.jpg|thumb|This is what you should do if you're pregnant]]
Yes, you're pregnant.

===What do I do?===
You should have an [[abortion]].  You should also join [[teenmommies]] immediately.
