[[The Donald]], or Donald Trump, is a [[Bullshit|god amongst men]].

Never piss around when the Donald is around.


Donald Trump is a fucking genius.  <s>We</s> Fags at ED stand behind him every step of the way. It should also be noted that he is a Jew King of the Jews as he has acquired more Jewgolds than anyone in the history of time, eva.

A fact that proves just how much of a genius The Donald is, is that he has personally gone bankrupt '''three fucking times'''. He's pissed away billions of dollars. And yet people ''still'' get in line to give this asshole their money.

In addition to the power to dupe non-jews out of their money, Trump also has the ability to suspend time itself. This amazing power means that even though he continues to get older, his girlfriends never age beyond 23. This power is also known as "money", and allows even an ugly, paunchy, used car salesman like Trump to score more tail than you ever will.

His toup√©e is made of pure <s>win</s> shit, because there is no fucking way that thing could be hair. 

Actually, the toupee is a hive of tiny [[jews]] controlling his every thought and movement.
