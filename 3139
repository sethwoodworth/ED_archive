Furmeet

[[Image:Banner.jpg|thumb|Furmeets offer a range of activities.]]

Furmeets are unholy [[Satan]]ic rituals that usually culminate in wild, greasy orgies with someone's dog and a large group of old, [[fat|overweight]] men whining over a two pound burrito at Taco Del Mar. Furmeets are the only occasion a [[furry|fur]] will actually venture outside [[IRL]], making it an interesting, yet horrific spectacle for an outside observer.

== How to spot a Furmeet ==
Furmeets are very easy to confuse with a [[Star Trek|trekkie]] meet, though they tend to take place in a more promiscuous location, like McDonald's or in front of the local porn store. If you think it may be a furmeet and not a more benign (but no less dorky) Otaku-grouping or trekkie meet, look for the following three signs:
# Is anyone wearing tails or ears? Otakus might wear the latter, but you'd be hard pressed to find some ''Naruto'' fanboy wearing a fox tail...made of [[dildo]]s.
# Is anyone actually doing anything? Furs can't adapt to the spooky world beyond the [[Internets]], which leaves them all transfixed in place like a [[fat]] [[cow]] staring into headlights.
# Is anyone eying passing dogs or cuddling stuffed animals? If so, it's advised you call your [[internet lawyer]] and [[sue]] for what happens to that poor puppy next.

== What to do if you spot a Furmeet ==
If [[God|destiny]] has led you to one of these perverted Disney discos, have no fear. This is your opportunity to ensure possession of [[Islam|72]] [[cp|year-old virgins]] in your afterlife. Like all [[ed|self-respecting organizations]], IRL bans furries on sight, and the [[police|mods]] will reward you for your ambitious nature. If you are low on ammunition, you may [[wtc|use the congregation as a landing strip]], or simply [[kill it with fire]].
