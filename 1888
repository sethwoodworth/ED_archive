'''Cuba''' is a [[communist]]-run concentration camp for [[Spics]] and [[Arab]]s South of [[Florida]]. 

==History==
Cuba was always a prison for its people. It used to have a pro-[[American]] puppet [[president]] in power and enjoyed a profitable economy of sex, tourism, bars, and nightclubs, all available to the average Amerofag visitor and provided by the average Cuban worker. All the fun stopped when [[Fidel Castro]] commied up the place and drove away boatloads of [[white people|white Cubans]] and all their [[Jew Gold]] to [[Miami]]. Everything stayed pretty much the same in terms of slave labor, although now, rather than cater to the [[Mafia]], the people now catered to Castro and his minions, and were forced to abandon their [[Voodoo|traditional religions]] and proclaim Castro a deity. Castro made sure all his <s>people</s> cronies were happy, and was [[incest|especially close]] to his brother Raul. The Jewnited States got pissed, so it sent a bunch of exiled Cubans to [[fail|invade]] the island who instead got beaten back by Cuba's ragtag military.

==Cuba today==
Its government currently jails millions of [[niggers|citizens]] in several cities, which are in fact filthy and crowded ghettos across the island. Havana, the largest ghetto, has its people working for the few tourists who still come to the island, and also to maintain all of Castro's palaces. In Southern Cuba, the Jew-run prison camp of [[Gitmo]] holds hundreds of prisoners sent there by the Americunts, all of them [[terrorist]] [[redundant|Muslims]] fresh from the [[Middle East]]. It is supposed to be torturous hell there, although the owners of the prison fail to realize that it would be better simply to release them into Cuban society. The rest of the country is simply miles and miles of malaria-infested forests, sometimes dotted with tiny [[Africa|Maroon]] villages. The inhabitants survive by [[Haiti|cutting down trees and selling the wood]], causing major [[butthurt]] to [[Environmentalism|envirofags]], who would rather they <s>starve</s> find something else to do.

==Recent lulz==
In 2006, Messianic Leader for Life Fidel Castro got really sick, and got even worse when he went to a Cuban hospital, so he let his brother Raul take over after the Cuban people [[W|democratically elected him]]. Cuba has boosted its military forces with old [[Russian]] equipment and vehicles and has staged exercises all in an attempt to [[Internet tough guy|warn the American Empire that the Cuban people are ready to resist any imperialist capitalist aggression against their homeland]].
