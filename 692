AudioLJ
'''AudioLJ''' was the brain child of some members of {{ljcomm|user=Random_Review}} (now suspended).  It consisted of live readings of [[LJ]] entries which were recorded into mp3s for the [[sex|enjoyment]] of others.

AudioLJ was abandoned some time ago.  If you ask [[User:Killhamster|Killhamster]] nicely though, he may share some of the old files.
