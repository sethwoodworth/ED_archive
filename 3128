What is '''funny'''? Strangely enough, the closest definition we have for funny is this:
{| class="boilerplate" id="pd" style=" background-color:#9f9f9f; border:2px solid #000000; padding: 0px;" cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0
| <big><big>"Funny"</big></big> is defined as "that which is [[not]] [[unfunny]]".
|}   "Funny" is something that you are probably not, and have proven multiple times in your life leaving you a [[virgin]]. Only a few people in the world are actually funny, and editing articles on [[ED]] didn't get them there. Below are some things actual funny people tend to joke about, and don't bother trying them, it wont make your mother or anyone else love you.  This article is not funny, it is [[serious]].

There are those who believe that there are things that are neither "funny" or "unfunny", but those people are unfunny and therefore do not count.
