Chan Ho Park is an [[asian]] MLB pitcher. [[At least 100 years ago]], he gave up TWO GRAND SLAMS IN THE SAME INNING. To add more [[lulz]], it was to the same guy who hit the first grand slam (a [[mexican]] of course). During the opening week the 2010 season of MLB, Park got rocked harded during a game against the Red Sox, thus making the [[Yankees]] lose the game. His excuse? Diarrhea of course! What else could cause such a [[I See What You Did There|shitty]] performance like that?
