 Jul 21 22:16:02 <pacifico>	Many of you may be aware of the current storm looming in the distance. The general chan sphere is being thrown increasingly into chaos by the spambots of Anontalk. 12chan is being spammed to hell. 420 /b/ is a radioactive zone. 99chan is down. 7chan? Have you seen their front page? They told their users to peacefully, and LEGALLY report anontalk.com to their isp. As of 11 pm Eastern Standard Time, pings to 7chan.org have ceased to resolve.
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <jerrcs2>	you guys are extremely boring
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	To put it simply, our usually peaceful coexistence has been threatened by a hostile and outside force that is hellbent on our mutual destruction. If there was any shred of a doubt, it should be gone now. We knew about this months ago, and yet nothing was done. And by our inaction we have allowed the problem to grow and grow until it has become something that not even the full combined force of the chans can keep at bay.
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	The hordes of /b/ raided anontalk a few days ago, in the thousands. Flooding, spamming, all a just recompense for the months of faggotry endured at the hands of anontalk. But nothing prepared them for what awaited, not even Ackbar could have foreseen the trap we had stumbled into. Anontalk.com was the most exploit ridden, malware spewing website that I have seen for as long as I can remember. The effects were swift and brutal. Nothing stood in their way,
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	 whether it be firefox, linux, peerguardian or whatever the skiddies used to cover their tracks. It had come down to the final showdown, and all our overwhelming numbers? they meant nothing. The newfags only served to add minions to the anontalk swarm, bots which were used to crush down 4chan in a fiery orgy of DDOS. Those who escaped fled, stricken with terror, shouting and spamming nonsensically for eyes and ears which remained closed. Few cared or b
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	othered to read the dire warnings, until it was too late.
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	The worm which they loaded into the newfags computers is a versatile sonuvabitch. It spreads, copies itself, and randomizes its core processes so that it can change and evade the most sophisticated defense mechanisms in real time, all without a central server update. It sends itself through AIM, skype, irc, hamachi, etc. and anyone who has had contact with a victim is vulnerable. It completely takes control of a compromised system, and automatically scan
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	s the ports of its next targets, looking, just looking for a way in.
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	What you can do:
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	Well what can you do, really I even don?t know what to do anymore. Everyone is totally disorganized. Ill try and briefly outline what I know.
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	1. THIS IS NOT A RAID, we have tried that, the results are well known. Right now we are not seeking numbers, because numbers work against us. What we need are people who actually know what they are doing to meet on irc @ irc://irc.partyvan.fm/anontalkraid Quality, not quantity.
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	2. DDOS seems to be the only thing to keep them down without an hero in the process. BUT BE WARNED, they change the dns A LOT and redirect requests to other sites and servers (ours). You absolutely must be on irc to have realtime updates of the backend ip, or you will end up ddosing chans. This is not something that can simply be left on all night, you have to literally watch it like a hawk.
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	3. Keep it a secret, 7chan fucked up by publicly showing their support for the fight by telling people what to do on their front page, now the cat is out of the bag. Keep things low key, don?t mention where you come from. The last thing I intended was to actually get you guys involved over your heads in this.
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	Also all the spambots are controlled via IRC or http,
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	we don't know as it's source code is not availabe.
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	The bots constantly change the spam text and has memory based spam as in.
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	-Generate random key.
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	-spam with randomkey
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	-link to random key
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	-generate insult to random key
 Jul 21 22:16:03 <pacifico>	Its highly likely that if your being spammed by random bullshit, it?s the bot.
