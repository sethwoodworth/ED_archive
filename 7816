Steve Jackson Games is a publisher of [[role-play]]ing games.  Their niche is [[nerd]]s who are too pretentious to play [[Dungeons and Dragons]], but not pretentious enough to [[LARP]].

== About ==
Like all other [[roleplayers]], Steve Jackson Games is made up of [[anthropophobia | anthropophobic]] [[basement dweller]]s.  This is why the company is headquartered in a dingy blue warehouse which is surrounded by trees and just down the road from the Whataburger.

== The h4x0r Lulz ==
In 1990, Steve Jackson Games was invaded by federal government agents who caught wind of their publishing [[hacker]] manuals.  Once the feds got the computers back to their secret headquarters, they found out that the manuals were for basement-dwelling [[geek]]s who wanted to ''pretend'' that they are hackers.  In the ensuing [[lulz]], J Edgar Hoover shot coffee out of his nose all over the confiscated computers.  

The destroyed machines and data were buried between Elvis and Jimmy Hoffa.  Steve Jackson games sued for lots of years, but never got their <del>computers</del> Vic-20s back.
