The '''Unidentified Rodian with jacket''' is a character from the ''Clone Wars'' TV series of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' canon. He also has [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Unidentified_Rodian_with_jacket his own Wookieepedia article]. All he does is walk by with a jacket. No, really. Why it needed an article is beyond anyone here.
