'''Television''' is a mind numbing device that will take all your pains and sorrows away, thirty sublime minutes at a time. [[Lie|Watching too much TV can lead to incredible results]] such as a higher [[Mega ultra super genius|IQ]], healthier and shinier hair, a moar trim [[omg|physique]], and of course, a much bigger [[penis]].  But teh Tele is so much more than just the cure for [[lulz|everything]]. It also keeps you in the NOW on awesome and important events; such as the weather, what's coming on teh Tele next, golf, [[AIDS]], [[porn]], and [[celebrity|celebrities]]. What moar could you want? <s>Amirite</s>? NO, YOU ARE NOT RIGHT GODDAMMIT!!!! TELEVISION WORKS YOUR MIND OVER LIKE THE LAPD WORKED OVER RODNEY MOTHERFUCKING KING!!! IT HAS TURNED [[America|WHOLE COUNTRIES]] INTO SACKS OF SHIT WHO DROOL AND BABBLE INCOHERENT SHIT ABOUT CELEBRITIES. PICK UP A BOOK, YOU FUCK!

==History==
Television was made 2500 B.C. by some Caveman named Britney Spears. He died 2 days later after a show named "Jersey Shore" gave him a heart attack. The invention is currently the most popular in the world with 767 Trillion sold just this last week. It will explode if you turn it to a channel called "Lifetime". The have a new invention called a "Flat Screen" only 7 people have on in the entire world. In 2084 it was critisized for being "Too Smarty" and it can make people get a disease called "Happiness", and by 2173 it has gave 84.8 Million people that disease. But they hope people will forget with a new invention they plan to make called "Tu-Fa Nieg-Wi".

Television is not to be confused with [[Media]] which is [[own]]ed by the [[Jews]]. [[Some argue]] that the [[Jews]] and [[Gay]]s are working together based on the uprising of [[faggotry]] programming, but this has yet to be confirmed.

Through the use of the incredible and helpful [[whore|whores]] at [[MTV]] and [[Fox News]], Television controls every aspect of the World's culture, and hypnotizes [[You|idiots]] into not worrying (except about [[Global Warming]]), and [[lulz|taking all your cares away]].

Sometime [[last Thursday]] the greatest thing since teh Tele came out, HD Tele. This is 'High Definition' Television. It costs as much as a car (but who cares, it's worth it!), and makes things on teh Tele look [[moar]] like things in real life. If you are one of the .0001% of people who own an HD television, then congratulations on spending [[over nine thousand]] dollars. You are now an 1337 technophile.

==You need [[MOAR]] television==

Anyone with half a brain knows Television just plain improves <s>the quality of your life </s> your lack of friends when used properly, with other great self help products such as Twinkies, Kool-Aid, and, especially, the bong. 

In time, Television will probably claw its way up to the status of a Class A [[drug]], with the introduction of more [[Fellatio|MTV]] ''My [[Loli|Sweet Sixteen]]'' shows, VH1 ''[[Shit|Celebreality]]'', ''[[Loser|The Apprentice]]'' with [[Jenkem|Donald Trump]] , ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', "Above the Influence" commercials, and ''[[Furry|America's Funniest Home Videos]]''.

===Interacting with Your TV===
When watching Television it is important to remember that whatever you're seeing on the screen can hear and see you too, but only if you [[all caps|YELL AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE]]. [[jock|Sports Fans]] are believed to be the first to have discovered this principle, and tend to [[In the ass|demonstrate it]] while watching their favorite teams go all the way to teh [[The Rapture|Super Bowl]]. It is also very important to note that throwing any [[cock|hard object]] at your television will not influence the contents displayed, although that should change with time.

After [[at least a hundred]] years of getting up off the couch to change the channel, man finally invented the [[Slavery|remote control]], which uses the power of [[Fursecution|elven magic]] to talk to your tv and convince it to change the channel. Thanks to this invention, [[Japan|Nintendo]] was able to come up with the idea for the Nintendo Wii.

[[Bullshit|Legal experts]] agree [[masturbation]] to any image on your TV can be considered p&aelig;dophilial if the pixels forming that image are less than eighteen years old; [[Research|preliminary analysis]] indicates that all underage red pixels are [[loli]], and the others [[shota]].
