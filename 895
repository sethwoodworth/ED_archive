As [[Kazaa]] is the [[AIDS]] of [[P2P]] networks, '''Bearshare''' can be thought of as the furry version of said networks. It is commonly used by [[13 year old boys]] and other rejects who fail at using far superior programs like [[Limewire]] and [[Google]]. Due to copyright laws in America, users of this program are only able to download viruses disguised as furry [[porn]]; free music downloading is also restricted, ensuring butthurt among its users, and making [[Itunes]] look better.<br/><br/>

There is also a similar program known as [http://www.bearflix.com/ ''Bearflix''], designed for the purpose of downloading gay porn. Like Bearshare, it only works for finding gay movies. Unlike Bearshare however, it comes with claims of no viruses, spyware, or intrusions, even though the program itself is malicious.
