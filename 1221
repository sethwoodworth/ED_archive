==Bullystoppers Mission==
Bullystoppers is a site dedicated to helping you protect [[pussy|yourself]] from [[Hal Turner|bullies]].

==Reasons to Cry to Mama==
According to the Bullyologists at Bullystoppers.com, the following are legitimate reasons for being depressed and [[emo]] about being bullied (these are direct quotes from the site):

* Someone is threatening to beat you up in school, including when walking to or from school, when you get off the bus, while talking to you on your cell phone or while you are online using instant messaging, in chat rooms or by email.
* Someone is taking something of yours without your permission.
* Someone is spreading rumors about you or your family. (whether it is true or not)
* Someone is embarrassing you in front of others by either calling you names or doing something to you (like hiding your book, pulling your seat out from under you, etc.) 
* Someone is telling other kids not to talk to you or be friends with you.
* Someone continues to shove into you in the halls and says it is always an accident.
* Someone is sexually harassing you (always following you around, whistling at you when you walk by, making comments about your body, etc.)
* Someone is [[TSA|touching your special area]] when you have told them not too.

To many, these are signs of being bullied. But those who feel this way are [[liberal|fucking whiner pussies]]. To [[Gay|everyone else]], the above situations are what is known as "High School"
