{{spoilers|ENCYCLOPEDIA.COM CONTAINS [[Fact|FACTUAL]] CONTENT, UNLIKE WIKIPEDIA!!!!111!}}


[http://www.Encyclopedia.com Encyclopedia.com] is an online encyclopaedia of crap thrown together as either a practical joke or a get-rich-quick scheme. Founded sometime [[last Thursday]], the current incarnation features [[at least 100|over 300 articles]], 8 of which are interesting. On the front page is a "Today in History" mini-cap that briefs some of the less interesting events of [[last Thursday|the past]].

This site is the first stop of internet-unsavvy [[13 year old boys|teenagers]] when seeking information for [[masturbation|school projects]]. It has gained notoriety at [[Livejournal]] of being an alternate source of [[facts]] when intelligent trolls accuse [[Wikipedia]] of being inaccurate. However, users fail to recognize that most Wikipedia articles are verbatim copy/pastes of Encyclopedia.com articles with copyright information removed.
