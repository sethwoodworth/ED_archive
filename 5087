'''MTV''' (AKA ''eMpTyV'') is an abbreviation for '''Music Television''' a [[Shit|shitty]] 24 Hour Music Channel (despite there being no music on MTV anymore due to [[AIDS]]). 

The best example of [[old media]] [[division by zero]]; also a favorite television channel of [[13-year-old boy|13-year-old]] [[wigger]]s, [[16-year-old girl|little teeny bopper bitches]] who [[asking for it|ask for it]] and [[emo]] [[fag]]s who don't know what good music sounded like, having only ever heard stories about it from [[old people]] who were around to witness its existence. Those fortunate enough to be literate may even have read about it in books, although they probably don't watch MTV anyway, so that doesn't matter.

The channel used to be mostly music and have a couple of cool shows like Beavis and Butthead, and Daria; but they quickly removed all music and scripted shows and replaced them with stupid cunts televising their attention-seeking antics in a desperate attempt to get 15 minutes of fame.

MTV is also the channel that promotes a [[communist]] agenda of stupidity by making spoiled dumbass sluts into popular celebrities such as [[Paris Hilton]].



==MTV and the War on Acceptable Music==
Since its inception [[no more than 99]] years ago, MTV has attempted to systematically air [[Shit|shitty]] music and exterminate good music, and to date, they have been reasonably successful in this regard. [[Some argue|A lot of people claim]] that the key to their victory was their outright refusal to have [[Lie|good]] music videos played on their channel, or even to acknowledge the existence of real music in any way (as evidenced by the various award shows they host every year).

Responsible for the successful careers of such [[shit bands]] and artists as black person, Good Charlotte, [[Not_Gay|Blink]] [[13_year_old_boy|182]], [[My Chemical Romance]], Lil' Jon, [[Gay|Coldplay]] and [[Trap|James Blunt]]. Indeed, [[rumor]] has it that MTV's official policies ''require'' them to have one of the aforementioned on screen at all times. But obviously they should never actually play any of their songs. That would be severely damaging to their popularity.

==MTV and the War on '''EVERYTHING ELSE'''==
Seeing that real music had been sufficiently [[Anal sex|ass-raped]], MTV decided to set their sights on other things, and using censorship have now [[pwned]] a considerable [[%|percentage]] of the things that exist, including:

* [[Grammar]] and the rest of the English language, by [[Ebonics]] brainwashing.  Also, like, encouraging like, every teenager to, like, say the word "[[like]]" at like, every opportunity, like, ya know?
* Just about everything else except [[sex]] and [[money]], endless Cribs re-runs and Spring Break specials being the only things left with a place on the channel.

The following additional charges have been leveled against MTV:
*''A Shot at Love With [[Tila Tequila]]''
*''Date [[your mom|My Mom]]''
*''Next''
*''Room Raiders''
*''Damage Control''
*''[[Jersey Shore]]''
*Every other show on this channel

==MTV and the War on Family Values==

Pushing a culture-fucking agenda of [[tolerance]], many MTV programs showcase lots and lots of [[your mom|slutty girls]], softcore [[pr0n]], the glorification of [[Wigger|gangsta]] and thug life. Given that the average age of MTV viewers is 8 years, combined with an IQ that matches, MTV has caused a lot of [[IRL drama]] among stupid kids and their [[concerned mother|concerned mothers]] living in the [[suburbs]]. Often you find some parents group starting a campaign against MTV, however [[nobody gives a shit|they end as abruptly as they begin]]. Although the stories of how MTV has destroyed families is a good source of [[lulz]] for the [[internets]].

Interestingly enough, while MTV has a reputation among its [[retards|viewers]] as an "over-the-top", "edgy" network, they have in fact censored as much (if not more) of their content as most other cable networks.

==MTV Jokes==
[[People]] think they're [[no|e-funny]] by telling some form of the same [[joke]]: "A myth says that MTV used to play music." It's an [[old meme]].
