Ellipsis
Also known as an elipsis, these three seemingly harmless dots are the most overused punctuation mark in the [[wapanese]] language. Especially common in [[manga]] and [[Final Fantasy]] games or other [[RPGs]], they can usually be translated as "[[WTF]]? or as a thoughtful pause. More often than not the general translation is along the lines of the following

{{squote|I couldn't think of anything to write here so I'm just going to put these three dots instead and seem like I am thinking about the things I just said before I move on to something completely unrelated and even less interesting than the inane bullshit I just inflicted on you...}} In some cases it is used as shorthand for 
{{squote|There are no words to describe the'' (insert negative adjective here) ''of this scenario...}}

== Popular Usage... ==
Punctuation... series of three dots... indicates the writer trailed off... without completing sentence... or thought... or has no idea how punctuation is used... since most [[web]] [[user]]s are clueless [[idiot]]s... the ellipsis is the most frequently used form of punctuation... especially favored by [[teenager]]s... who similarly avoid the baffling complexities of capitalization... by always using lower case... or [[All caps|upper case]]... [[whatever]]...
