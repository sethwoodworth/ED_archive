[[Image:MONGO.jpg|thumb|right|John Seigenthaler Sr. recruited [[MONGO|this person]] to carry out government conspiracies]]
John Seigenthaler Sr. was Robert Kennedy's  administrative assistant in the early 1960s.  He was also the mastermind behind the CIA's successful plot to assassinate [[JFK]]. However, he and his fellow conspirators failed to pin it on [[Cuba]], thus falling short of their ultimate goal of destroying all human life through a worldwide nuclear holocaust during their meticulously-planned [[WWIII|Third World War]].

Somebody who knew that terrible secret put it on [[Wikipedia]]. As prompt as ever, the CIA notified Seigenthaler about four months later. His cronies tried changing the wiki (because Seigenthaler is too old to know how to get online), but their [[vandal]]ism was reverted by the admins and they were [[permaban]]ned.

A black helicopter (the silent kind) circled [[Jimbo Wales]]' house. Men in black got out and forced Jimbo to change the wiki at bazooka-point.

Seigenthaler then made a phone call to the [[Homeland Security]] thugs, who punched a button on a computer. ''Carnivore'' (which sees and records everyone's internet activity, including [[you]]rs) eventually spat out the name of Brian Chase. Brian Chase was a completely innocent [[luser]] who corrected a single misspelling in the Wikipedia article. Nonetheless, a UFO arrived at Brian Chases's business, sucked him up and replaced him with an alien clone.

He owns his own [[waaaambulance]] company.
