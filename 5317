Met Him/Her On Craigslist, Is This Win?
{{crapstub}}

"'''Met Her/Him On [[Craigslist]], Is This [[Win]]?'''", also known as "'''Got It On Craigslist, Is This Win?'''" is a [[meme]] coined on the night of july 2nd, 2010. In a random thread on [[/b/]] created by a [[faggot]], [[OP]] declared that post #247251700 would become a meme. Normally this sort of cockgobbling idiocy is ignored in the torrential and neverending shitstorm that is /b/, but the post that managed to get the desired number happened to be the OP of a thread, was neither a reposted meme, nor [[CP]], nor spam, and OP managed to get [[doubles]] yet again later in the thread. These were taken by the pagan cockworshippers of /b/ as signs from the heavens that the post in question was indeed divinely chosen to be a meme, and thus it began.

The original meme was an image of a Jew-nosed woman with an expression of blissful stupor plastered across her features, accompanied by the text: "''im about to meet this chick at a bar, i met her off craigslist. is this win?''" The meme consists of posting an image of something absolutely undesireable to any sane person (EG a [[tranny]], an oversized [[dildo]], an ugly car, an unpopular book, or a widely mocked and slandered celebrity), claiming that you found it/him/her on [[Craigslist]], and asking, with seeming seriousness, whether this is indeed [[win]].
