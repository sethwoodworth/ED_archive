Ana Voog
[[Image:Anavoog.jpg|thumb|This isn't camwhoredom, this is [[art]].  [[BTW]], buy something off my [[wishlist]], [[kplzthx]].]]

'''Ana Voog''' is an [[earth]]y crunchy [[camwhore]] who's not even all that cute, but gets by via ripping off Jennicam and supplying [[pictures plz]].  Known for her [[boob shots]] and various hair colors, she feels self important enough to have multiple domains and an [[FAQ]] that teaches people how to pronounce her name. Her boobs are damn fake, too.

==History==
Ana likes to present herself as the "second oldest 24 hour cam" and the first "art cam."  This merely means that she got her webcam prior to the existence of [[Amazon]] wishlists and was pissed that Jenni was getting the accolades and [[Stileproject]] wouldn't allow her on his portal.

She was born in 1966, which, on the [[internets]], is equivalent to [[at least 100 years ago]].
