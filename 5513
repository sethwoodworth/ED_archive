'''Mozilla Firefox''' (originally titled Furryfox, aka Failfox) is a [[internet|web]] [[browser]] from the Mozilla Foundation, of which version 1.0 was released [[at least 100 years ago]]. 

Designed exclusively for [[1337|elitist]], [[basement dwelling]] [[Fags|bloggers]] experiencing [[Seamonkey|Netscape Communicator]] [[drugs|withdrawal]], Firefox quickly became the browser of choice for [[everyone|those]] disillusioned with [[Internet Explorer]].  Firefox is commonly used by [[13-year-old boy]]s to look up [[pr0n]] so their [[Your mom|parents]] don't find out.

Firefox was famous after its launch since it is one of the few [[open source]] programs to actually achieve version 0.5. Since then, Firefox has reached [[over 9000|over 25 million downloads]]. To get an idea of how many downloads that is, you need to go to http://www.mozilla.com/firefox and download it 25 million times.

==Why Switch to Firefox?==

<s>Firefox is an excellent browser, regardless of memory use, speed, functionality, and security.</s>

<s>Firefox is a very shitty browser.</s>

<s>Firefox is better than your current [[Bawwwww | shitty browser]].</s>

With the recent mass adoption of Internet Explorer 6, there is no reason to use firefox.

==Firefox vs. Internet Explorer==

Money made (2006) by Microsoft by distributing Internet Explorer: $0 USD.

Money made (2006) by the Mozilla [[The man|Corporation]] by [[Anal Sex|bending over]] for Google: $47,064,657 USD. (''[[Profit]]'', not revenue.)  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation Seriously.]

===Benefits===	

[[Dell|Browsing Porn]].  This is the greatest benefit.[http://www.squarefree.com/pornzilla/]
<pre><jesterlo1> So back in the day of the modem, when porn was limited to pictures only, 
I used to go to lots of thumbnail galleries and save the pictures to a folder that 
I would use a slideshow on afterwards.

<jesterlo1> The great thing about a slideshow is that pressing any 
key makes it disappear, good for the uninvited guest, know what I mean?

<jesterlo1> Well it turned out that uninvited guest was my father and I was in the 
middle of a "session" so I quickly press escape and ask him whats up.

<jesterlo1> He looks at me, looks at the screen, I look at the screen, say, "uhhhhhhhhhh", 
then he mutters something about if there was any email for him and leaves quickly.

<jesterlo1> FUCKING INTERNET EXPLORER HAS "SET AS BACKGROUND" NEXT TO "SAVE IMAGE"

<jesterlo1> And said pic was a huge cock spraying all over this girls face.

<jesterlo1> But because of the dimensions of the pic, all you could see was a huge cock spraying 
as my background.

<jesterlo1> And that my friends, is why I use Firefox.</pre>

Aside from its beauty, speed, agility, red mane, pleasant musky scent, warm fur (OMG YIFF YIFF YIFF! ARGGGGGGGG [[I CAME]]!), and [[Shit|advanced]] [[cock|pop-up]] blocking features, Firefox has the advantage over other browsers in one respect.	

Tabbed browsing. [[OMG]]! [[Opera Browser|IT'S LIKE SO TOTALLY ORIGINAL!!!]]

[[pwned|Unfortunately]] for Firefox [[nerds]], Internet Explorer 7 was released with tabbed browsing, so the above paragraph is [[moot]]. Besides, [[Opera Browser|Opera]] did it [[at least 100 years ago|way back]] in 1996. However, [[over 9000|everyone]] will still regard Internet Explorer as [[shit]] and always will. 	

Another feature is being frozen for a half hour while your browsing history loads, as well as randomly crashing. Suddenly, [[Internet Explorer]] looks good.

Plus, [[Urban dead]] gets teh upgraded graffix.

Also, Firefox is the browser that [[Scenesters]] claim for reasons they themselves don't understand their [[Shit|Br00tal]] [[MySpace|myspaces]] are best viewed on, though they of course don't know what the fuck they're talking about and are mostly doing it for the [[USI]] factor, and the belief that in order to view their 1337 html $killz, Firefox is required. 

There is exactly [[shitload|one metric shit-ton]] of [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/?featured=recommended addons] and [[haxorz]][http://www.techradar.com/news/software/applications/8-hacks-to-make-firefox-ridiculously-fast-468317] to make you [[1337|teh uber power uz3r]], but [[noone cares]].

===The Browser for [[idiots|Treehuggers]]===
Firefox claims on its website to be a [[bullshit|100% organic browser]], attempting to turn the issue of browser preference into an environmental dilemma with severe moral implications.  This gimmick is sure to entice [[hippies]], [[poseur]]s, and [[fuckwit]]s.  Nevermind the fact that all computer programs are nothing but electrons, and the act of sitting on your [[fat]] ass surfing [[The Internet is serious business|the internet]] and producing methane does nothing to counter [[global warming]], whether the crumbs of food that get stuck in your keyboard were produced with the use of pesticides or not.

==Spreading [[AIDS]]==
[[Image:Pedofox.jpg|thumb|right|Beta version fine-tuned for [[CP]] browsing.]]
Firefox was such a [[Internet phenomenon|phenomenon]] that a whole bunch of non-furry Firefox lovers (not that any of them aren't closet furries, mind [[you]]) got together on a website called [http://www.SpreadFirefox.org SpreadFirefox.org] and made it their purpose to make everyone a Firefox user. With their battle cry of "Take Back the Web", they showed their love and devotion to the browser.

Unfortunately, these people were (and are) largely unaware that Mozilla Corp. spent millions of dollars on a traditional, big-evil-corporate ad campaign to build up [[Duke Nukem Forever|hype]].

==Bantown==	
At Toorcon 2006, notorious Bantown cybercriminals Revmischa and [[weev]] announced that they had found over 30 vulnerabilities in Firefox Javascript, which they planned to use to take over the Internets. Much [[drama]] ensued, especially among the open sores community who were distressed at the thought that they could no longer bore people by explaining how secure their browser was. It was later revealed that the whole thing had been a [[troll]], and that Bantown didn't have 30 vulnerabilities at all, just one shitty one. Except [[weev]], who had over 30 Firefox 0days revealed to him in mystical communion with the prophet Jah Lightning, after he [[I accidentally X|accidentally]] took [[acid]] and [[meth]] at the same time.

==Firefox 3.6==
[[image:Lynx.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot from Firefox 3.0 beta]]
It's not very often we like to mention factual information on [[ED]], but we would like to inform you that this program is unstable as [[fuck]]. At the request of our website owner, [[Joseph Evers]], Here's [http://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=firefox a link] to "fix" (downgrade) your shitty 2.0 installation for Windows.

==Firefox for Pedos==	
A while back, a group of [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]] launched their own version of the browser, featuring a [[Lolicon|lolifur]] splash screen, and links to several [[CP]] sites. [[some argue|It is also rumored]] to contain embedded [[FBI]] monitoring software.
	
[http://www.lolifox.com Prepare to be shocked and amazed.]

==Demonic Connection==
Any user trying to find out the true meaning of Firefox needs not look further then the supplied information pages. Simply type in ''about:mozilla'' and you will receive FireFox's true meaning:

{{quote|
Mammon slept. And the beast reborn spread over the earth and its numbers grew legion. And they proclaimed the times and sacrificed crops unto the fire, with the cunning of foxes. And they built a new world in their own image as promised by the sacred words, and spoke of the beast with their children. Mammon awoke, and lo! it was naught but a follower.
|from The Book of Mozilla, 11:9 <br />(10th Edition)}}

Without doubt the foxes represent Microsoft who using their unique brand of logic attempted to take over the world by distributing medicore webbrowsers thus resurecting the beast that is and was [[Anonymous]]. This red is an accurate rendering of the blood of Opera.

==Personas==
[[Last thursday]]'s update added [[shit|personas]] which let people make a theme and submit it. They only allow [[retarded|G-rated]] personas so its [[gay]].
