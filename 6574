PowerfulHorse
{{lolcow}}

'''PowerfulHorse''' is a [[furry]] [[tracing|artist]] who spends his time pretending to pump iron at the gym, and rubbernecking the bodybuilders. He also enjoys shooping the heads of animals onto the steroid abusing men and calls them [[shit|"artworks"]]. One will notice that the arms of his "OCs" look as if they have been injected with cantaloupes. Like all [[furry|furries]], the [[victim complex|internet is out to get him]].

== The Free Furry Union and Universal Furry Union ==

The Free Furry Union was, originally, an idea made by two furries against United Furries Argentina (UFA) after the UFA tried to join a Union from Spain. 

PowerfulHorse took the name of Free Furry Union (UFL IN SPANISH) and took a different way than the two original furries had. This resulted in the original two being b& from the UFL and the change of the UFL to UFU.

Sum Data : This original furs were NEVER EVER part of the UFL, but Powerful added them to the list of members anyway.  This brought the total number of members up to three.

[[Image:Power2007.jpg|thumb|right|Good old times…]] [[Image:reaction-drag2.jpg|thumb|right|UFA members don't admit, but they fap to BAAWfulhorse 'til today.]]

=== UFU (EX UFL) ===

*The members, at the UFU website, are three furfags. PowerfulHorse, Starsoul and Tsubaki the kitten [[babyfur]].
*All of the members are gay.
*All of the members claim to be lawful good.

Starsoul: starsoul06@hotmail.com

=== The Butthurt ===

{{squote|Since you will have seen the community Union Furry Libre I change name and his new name is an Union Furry Universal, this was due to the fact that after an investigation there was discovered the real Origin of the UFL that belonged originally to two users who are very hostile of the convention and group called Union Furry Argentina, on having discovered the truth, These users were automatically expelled from the UFU (Union Furry Universal) since they cheated our members trying to do a community that dyed the intentions of taking her to him against to the UFA, thing that the UFU although we do not share ideal any with the UFA, WE ARE NOT A COMMUNITY THROWS AGAINST THE UFA IF NOT AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE LATIN, INTERNATIONAL AND ARGENTINE FANDOM THAT EXISTS AT PRESENT. 

As Other News us to come information and assertion that some ex-users who were expelled are defaming saying blasphemies lies and defamations about some members of this community in webs like Deviant Art, Encyclopedia and others, for the readership they are careful they do not believe in everything what they read and find out well the truth before extracting its own conclusions since in the world of the Furry as there are the good people also there are many Liars circulating.|PowerfulHorse on tl;dr}}

<!-- == OMGZORS TEH DRAMA ==
[[Image:Drama.jpg|thumb|left|Right now, he is watching this page and WITH THAT face.]]
[[Image:WEB-site.jpg|thumb|right|This is his [[fursona]], [[faggot|a very muscular]] [[gay|macho]] with a huge [[penis]].]] 

[[Last Thursday|Once upon a time]], a [[whore]] called Genoveva and a Ktulu spawn called Alfonso, met at a motel and Alfonso, after several infusions of beer, decided that fucking the [[bitch]] would be a good idea. This led to [[bestiality|sum fun with farm animals]], whereupon after a wild orgy with several sheep, a pig, and [[a cat is fine too|the family cat]], they turned their lust upon an innocent horse, Lucy. Lucy was clearly [[asking for it]], and nine months later gave birth to a horrible [[gay|crossbreed]] with [[Asperger's syndrome]].

The result: POWERFULHORSE!

Claiming to be heterosexual, this little [[cunt]] thinks that he is the alpha male, and you are nothing.
And if you talk against him, then you are in a [[paranoid|plot with the UFA to kill him]].

Newsflash: Drawing yourself with females and doing the sex with them don't make you more macho. It just makes you look MOAR gay.

I'm commenting this out until somebody can elaborate on the drama and translate it into english - Vonranke -->


=== Sockuppeting === <!-- HOLY SHIT GUYS DOES EVERY SECOND FUCKING WORD NEED TO BE PIPED?-->

[[Image:Suckpuppet_ph.jpg|thumb|Hi guyz I am not a sockpuppet lol]] 

<s>PowerfulHorse</s> [http://farenheith.furrynetwork.com/ Farenheith], is a fucking pegasus with the same fucking style, claiming that "Powerful Horse teached him how to draw with the only condition of be just like PH and to be his succesor" … because, you know, faking leaving the internetz must sound dramatic and like you will never come back, while you have this extreme suckpuppet that is YOU and although anyone notice that it's you, you claim that you are another person.

== Trolling ==

[[YOU]] can also post BREADFRUIT.

This seems to be some sort of meme found only in Argentina.

'''BREADFRUIT!'''

<!--== A message from the Spanish community ==


Si borras este articulo,va a volver a aparecer. NO te vas a escapar facil del drama, porque vos lo buscaste.

Todos sabemos que no te violaron, y si lo hicieron, queremos pruebas.

Y se sabe que te la pasaste toda la convención furry haciendote el macho, y rogando que te la metan.

Y aparte : Dibujarte como un caballo musculoso y con un gran pene no te hace más macho…'''te hace más puto.'''


Nos ha llegado nueva información de que nos andas diciendo Furries. Estas muy equivocado.
No somos furries, sino gente mucho más inteligente que vos. 

Las mentiras que andas diciendo por ahí, de que todos son unos mentirosos, son patrañas. Tenemos pruebas de lo hipócrita, inmaduro, tarado y puto reprimido que sos. 

No estamos del lado de la UFA, ni de nadie.

Tambien anduve enterandome que andas acusando a gente que nada que ver en este asunto. YO soy Almafuerte. Y yo tuve más valor que todas esas putitas de la UFA que no te dijeron lo tremendamente puto y tragaleche que sos. 

OTRO APARTE

'''EL TAMAÑO DEL E-PENIS Y DEL PENE REAL NO ES PROPORCIONAL.'''

con amor,y preservativos para evitar TU sida.

PD: Thnx to some user…it was very usefull the edition. I'm sorry for my very bad grammar, and my horrible way to just…stfu and write all don't even knowing what is wrong. Again, thnx.

''This message mainly talks about how PowerfulHorse went to a furry convention solely to get [[Buttsex|buttsecks]] and how much a [[pussy]] he is.''
HOW ABOUT NO FUCKING MESSAGE FROM THE SPANISH COMMUNITY? -->

==[[Fur Affinity]] Drama==

PowerfulHorse has been banned forever from FurAffinity. He just couldn't stop with his [[Internet_tough_guy|Macho]] insults and threats.
But that wasn't Enough for him, He decided to pull an [[Cry|angry fit]] and went for the members of [http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_fa/ WTF_FA] and sent Lulsy comments full of Daisies and Flowers.

{{squote|''How are You Piece of Son of a Bitch''

''How are you , you fucking piece of faggot, human trash, I would love to be near you to break all your bones one by one, you are nothing but an AIDS-filled faggot that deserves the most painful death of the world only for generalize everyone that has contact with you in your sorry-ass person. You will blow soon and I will pee in your trash of a grave and everyone will be happy that you die and your dirty soul will be destroyed so you will never bastardice anyone more with your extreme faggotry.''
''I am Homophobic of fucking sorry-ass faggots like you, and I am also an antifurry because of trash and human waste like you make me hate furries with my soul. I would love to see you pay one '' '''?????? (Srsly what the fucking shit)''' ''for that that scandal of AIDS-dreaded histerical gay thing you have been doing of my persona, I hope to see you dead soon. I shall see you in hell you fucking bastard ''.|PowerfulHorse}}

== MUSIC ==

Yes, now PowerfulHorse makes music.

[http://www.sheezyart.com/view/1563742/ an example of his fine voice]

[http://powerfulhorse.deviantart.com/journal/18129538/ Journal about hiz muzikz] He is now planning to take out a CD

==Fur Affinity Drama Redux==
When we finally had some peace of mind, Powerful Horse decided it was a great idea to come back to [[Fur Affinity]] creating a [[Sock_puppet|new, original and totally different]] character named [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/star-light Star-Light]. The reason why he made a new account was because he actually e-mailed Dragoneer and Dramatus asking for permission to make a new account. Since he never got an answer, his little mind understood that it was totally ok and awesome to go ahead with the plan!
	 
Of course that after insulting all the members of the UFA, random friends of those members and even Dragoneer himself, he got a nice perma-ban sammich served with lulz and chiantti.
	 
[[Image:NewPHpuppet.jpg|thumb|Hi guyz I am not a sockpuppet lol]]
	 
It was presented as a new member of the furfag nation, mysteriously drawing the same crap, the whiny music, broken English translator overdose. Of course, it was a brand new member, totally not Powerful Horse.
	 
But he made a fatal mistake! He actually made contact with the demonic forces of the UFA, who played along with him, until he posted a very heterosexual, straight, macho submission. A Donkey on a red diapper [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2624325 right here]! That's when they nailed him, got a nice "BAN EVADER!" shout on his shoutbox, reported and banned.
	 
Now how these masters of the puzzle solving, trouble shooting and overall gods of the lulz found that [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/star-light Star-Light] was Powerful Horse? Because of [http://powerfulhorse.deviantart.com/art/StarLight-Presentation-132165240 this] little morsel on Powerful Horse's [[Deviantart]]. It seems that nobody told him that if you make a new account, you don't leave the name on the old one.
	 
After he found out that his new [[sock_puppet|account]] was banned, he did what any sane and smart person would do in his place.
	 
Open not one, not two… but fifteen new accounts! Here they are:
	 
[http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse01 powerfulhorse01], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse02 powerfulhorse02], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse03 powerfulhorse03], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse04 powerfulhorse04], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse05 powerfulhorse05], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse06 powerfulhorse06], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse07 powerfulhorse07], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse08 powerfulhorse08], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse09 powerfulhorse09], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse10 powerfulhorse10], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse11 powerfulhorse11], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse12 powerfulhorse12], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse13 powerfulhorse13], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse14 powerfulhorse14], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/powerfulhorse15 powerfulhorse15]
	 
== [[Deviantart|DevianTART]] ==

After harassing the shit out of anyone from Argentina, furry and with a DA account. A miracle happened!

An Anonymous user actually found the morph used to make this amazing picture [http://us-p.vclart.net/vcl/Artists/Powerful-Horse/Powerful%20Horse/Space-Art-Wallpapers-01.jpg right here]. You can tell the similarities to [http://dineegla.deviantart.com/art/Yowlsa-48329381 this one here]. So he sent a friendly note to [http://dineegla.deviantart.com/ Dineegla] @ DA.

The story goes that circa 2007, Powerful Horse got the morphed picture from [http://www.morphed-muscle.com Morphed Muscle], a pay gay site… and added his trademark shitty horse head on it. Little he knew that the morph was made and copyrighted to [http://dineegla.deviantart.com/ Dineegla].

Hilarity ensues! Specially [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2745121/ here] and [http://dineegla.deviantart.com/journal/27004169/ here!]

Of course, Powerful Horse took it as an attack to [[gay|his rock solid heterosexuality]] and a crap fest started on Dineegla's profile and journal.

And guess who appeared out of nowhere to the rescue? Yes! His [[transexual|girlfriend!]] [http://abelatrix.deviantart.com/ Abel-a-trix!]

You can totally tell it's a [[fake|real]] profile because of the details, the photos of her, specially the ones with Flavi-oh!

=== Ban Evasion===

Because he just wanted to evade SUSPENSION. And as everyone know '''You can't get away from THE BANHAMMER'''… or SUSPENSIONHAMMER, whichever is the case right now.

Anyways, while we were all looking around and enjoying our "JEWS DID WTC" day… PowerlessHorse decided to evade a suspension that was done '''yesterday''' by the DeviantArt Staff in his last account.

You can spam and report in his new DA. 
<s>http://powerfulhorse2010.deviantart.com/</s> '''BANHAMMERED TO DEATH'''

Remember kids, trying to get away from THE BANHAMMER means that you will be permaban'd. Always read the FAQ, and ''STOP-REPORTING-THAT-WHO-REPORT-YOU-FROM-EVADING-SUSPENSIONS OR BANS''.

Shouting everybody who tells you that you are raping the policy and terms from the site "YOU ARE REPORTED" doesn't make you smarter or will help you to get away from the suspension.


== Orobas2012: PowerfulHorse Verbose Personality ==

First of all, we must tell that PowerfulHorse suddenly got [[Aspie|assburgers]], and make an online DA-Friend called [http://orobas2012.deviantart.com/ Orobas2012].

And friendship came along, where PowerfulHorse (as Orobas2012) praised himself and his art. 

But then the storm came, because people discovered quickly that they were the same person by a journal that Orobas posted which (Oh, good heavens!) was the same journal that PowerfulHorse posted that same day, at the same hour, at the same minute.

So PowerfulHorse decided to invite Orobas to his DA account. Oh, and made a fake picture for the lulz!

[[Image:Imagen160.jpg|thumb|right|Srly guyz,no photoshup heer lol]]

== Hacked ==

After the Orobas incident happened his "Orobas" personality sent pseudo-verbose comments to other users in DeviantArt.

But today the lulz happened.
'''Someone actually hacked PowerfulHorse DeviantArt account, and posted a nice journal saying the following.'''

{{quote|The truth is that you were right about me. I'm pathetic. I'm just a looser without friends, who craves for attention because when I was a kid my school mates bullied me for being slow. I'm 30 yo. and I live with my parents and I play being a pop star instead of looking for a job, because they've kicked me out of every job I had for being totally useful.

Sigh… I want to confess that I'd really like to be shagged but at the same time I fear I'd like it. I'd love to try a plonker I my arse but I've not the bravery to ask anybody. It's ok to be gay.

I just want to be accepted, to love and be loved in return.}}

The hacker decided to invert some time and modified PowerfulHorse icon, his ID, and posted "apologies" into other deviants that PowerfulHorse attacked. 

We must congratulate the [[Anonymous]] [[DeviantArt]] user who did this work, and rise him on a temple for a work that should have been done [[last thursday]] for the win/fail.

<center>{{bigpic|Powerfulhorse on deviantART 1256222253560.jpeg|900|200}}</center>

=== Unhacked ===

When you think that it's over for a while, PowerfulHorse appears again with a new account.

<s>[http://septimoarcangel.deviantart.com/ SeptimoArcangel], his new brand ban-evasion account.</s> '''BANHAMMERED TOO'''

'''Because someone can't handle being hacked, amirite?'''

Oh, and you can report him for stealing his own artwork, since the gallery of PowerfulHorse (hacked or not) still have the original works.

By the way,he posted on his own hacked account with this, so he just shouted to the world [[ALLCAPS|"I'M POWERFULHORSE! HACK ME AGAIN! IT MAKES ME HORNY!"]]

{{clear}}

== He loveth thyself ==

In January 2010, two years after starting all his drama with the furry community, he sends some Argentinian furries several pictures of his venous [[cock]] and his overworked flexing muscles to show how much he has overcome his narcissistic personality disorder over the years. His pictures come with something which translates to

{{quote|Enjoy them, and with these you don't need to make scandals, or talk about me all day, you see me and that's all.}}

We can all see he clearly has no issues with himself anymore, [[sarcasm|he's not a self-centered dickweed]]. What he needed to become a good wholesome fulfilled person was [[bodybuilder|bodybuilding]] and showing off to people who [[Shit nobody cares about|don't give a shit]] through e-mail.
