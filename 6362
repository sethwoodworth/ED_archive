[[You|Some loser]] posted the story of his fucked-up love life on /b/. With his rant, he posted a picture of his [[cat]], Peter.

Obviously, /b/ [[Shit nobody cares about|didn't emotionally partake]], but it fell in love with Peter.
Plenty of image macros featuring Peter have been created since.
When on [[B/|/b/]], try [[DO IT FAGGOT|not to]] insult [[Bullshit|Peter's divinity]], doing so will result in much [[drama]].

Pete, like all famous [[cat]]s, shares in both the gift that is to be an enamored cat and the curse it is to live your life in the spotlight. He has done nothing important. He hasn't induced any [[lulz]], he hasn't rallied [[anon]]s to [[epic]] [[raid]]s, he hasn't motivated masses of pimple-faced [[basement-dwellers]] to modify currency in an effort to troll the "[[man]]". No, he has done none of that. In fact, the only thing Peter is guilty of is...well, being fucking cute. I dare you to find a cuter cat. I double fucking doggy dare you.

==History==

On the warm spring evening of 4/09/09, and a certain /[[b]]/tard decided to post a [[random]] picture of his beloved [[feline]] companion. The original thread has disappeared into obscurity, but the ripples made into the stream of life by his actions are still felt throughout the [[4chan]] community. Quickly, [[newfags]] united with very little opposition by the armies of [[oldfaggotry]] and adopted Peter The Cat as their new reigning king of [[cats]] and savior of humanity. To this day, Peter The Cat(or Piotr for the russian-folk) is widely accepted as /b/'s King Of Cats.

===The Duality Of Peter===

[[Image:Admiralcatispeter.jpg|thumb|Admiralcat v.s. Peter]]
On 4/13/2009, it was revealed to the masses, through clever detective work, that admiralcat and Peter are in fact one in the same. The following picture outlines similarities in the bed sheets. Also, the same had been said before based on their similar fur patterns, yet was debunked that same day because admiralcat has two streaks of black fur on the upper part of his eyes. A few days later, the original 'shopper of the admiralcat picture came forth and revealed that the second black streak on admiralcat's left eye was [[photoshopped]] there to give the appearance of an angry, yet determined, cat headed to his submarine to invade [[Amerika]]. Also, [[Lenincat]].

Also, some cables in the background of both pictures were observed as being similar enough to warrant evidence.

If these allegations hold true, it would mean that Peter is <b>A)</b>bipolar <b>B)</b>in command of [[you]]r armies and nuclear arsenals. That would make him, quite literally, the most dangerous and the cutest [[cat]] of all time. Clearly defining his position as rightful king of the [[cat]] throne.
