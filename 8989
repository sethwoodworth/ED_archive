[[Image:Where is your God now The king.jpg|center|450px|]]<br>
A [[catchphrase]] which originated from the [[Bible|Ten Commandments]] and corrupted into an unfunny meme. The original quote is "Where is your God now Moses?" from the character Dathan, played by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_G._Robinson Edward G. Robinson.] Typically invoked ([[O RLY|sarcastically]]) to [[serious business|intimidate]], [[Intellectual Checkmate|challenge]], or [[furry|mock]].
