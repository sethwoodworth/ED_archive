'''Tubcat''' (aka "Tulle") is not only the first [[namecat]] but also the first [[cat]]-related [[internet phenomenon]] on record. Upon seeing Tubcat's astounding girth, many netizens [[Nice try|cried foul]], claiming that such a monstrosity could not be the product of [[Human|man]] and therefore must be the product of [[Photoshop]]. Sadly, they were mistaken; the most famous picture of Tubcat is actually one that appeared in ''[[old media|US Weekly]]'' way back in 2001 when anyone still read that shit.

Before [[LOLcats]], before [[Longcat]] or [[Ceiling Cat]] and before the [[meme]]-[[vomit]]ing [[4chan]] imageboard (circa 2003) even existed, Tubcat was already hard at work making internet great. In 2002, Tubcat captured the [[hearts]] and minds of [[teens]] and [[preteens]] alike. With phonetic spelling, poor [[grammar]] and the aggressive abuse of [[netspeak]], the [http://www.tubcat.com website] that started it all was written to [[parody]] the stereotypical [[OTI]] writing style of [[16-year-old girl]]s . Since the site was written before [[MySpace]] (2003) and other customizable [[Web 2.0]] sites existed, it originally served more as a parody of sites hosted on [[Geocities]] or some other free webhost. 

The [[diabetes]]-[[Disease|afflicted]] Tubcat [[met the reaper]] in [[2008]] at the ripe [[old]] age of [[13]] and the ripe round weight of 43 pounds. Although there was - and still is - only one Tubcat, there are many other [[Fat|tubby]] [[cats]] that have fallen into the tubes; some people also call these fine felines "tubcats".

Not to be confused with [[Bailout Plan|fat cats]], the corporate scumbags that everyone loves to hate, nor with [[Tubgirl]], which is [[Shock site|something else entirely]].

__TOC__ 

== A Brief History ==

{{squote|Tubcat became an Internet sensation in 2002 and was touted as the fattest kitty ever...Tubcat's picture initially appeared in [[Old media|US Weekly]], p. 96, on October 1, 2001. The cat's [[Powerword|real name]] is Tulle and the [[Preteen|12-year-old girl]] holding him is [Tabitha] Pedersen. They're from [[Denmark]], and Tulle was 6 years old and 43 lbs when the picture was taken (only 4 lbs less than Himmy). Tulle hit 19.2 kilos, but [[died]] of [[diabetes]] (and may have had [[Heart attack|heart problems]]), a common side-effect of [[obesity]], in January [[2008]].|[http://www.messybeast.com/freak-size.htm Sarah Hartwell]|on freak cats.}}

== Animal Cruelty ==
[[Image:Bodyconditionscorechartcat2.jpg|right|thumb|Tubcat is literally [[Morbidly obese|off the scale]]]]

[[Some argue|Some animal-rights supporters and veterinarians argue]] that overfeeding a cat to the point that it becomes grotesquely [[obese]] constitutes [[animal cruelty]]. Others argue that [[OMG|''CHUBBY KITTIEZ ARE SOoOoOoO CUTE!!!1'']] Guess which group spends more time [[on the internet]]?

{{quote|i too wish for TUBCAT a lng and happy [[life]]!!! pls don't say i am cruel i just love this [[fat]] [[pussy]] k\ittie!!! okay?! no more [[hate]] male!|[[Tubgirl|Tubcatgirl]]}}

== Tulle in the News ==

Since nothing [[TOW|notable]] happens in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] or [[Denmark]], Tulle was all over the local news there, even before Tubcat.com existed.

* <strike>[http://www.bt.dk/article/20010829/na/108290658/ August 29, 2001]: '''Tubcat can only roll''' [http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&hl=en&js=n&u=http://www.bt.dk/article/20010829/na/108290658/&sl=da&tl=en (shitty translation from Danish)]</strike> [[Deleted|BALEETED]]
** ''Tulle is sleepy, [[lazy]] and [[fat]]... When he rolls around on the floor, he can easily be confused with a beanbag chair... Motion is excluded. He is not able to waddle. Tulle can only roll.''

* [http://www.kvp.se/nyheter/1.992641/varldens-fetaste-katt-ar-dod January 6, 2008]: '''World's fattest cat is dead''' [http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&hl=en&js=n&u=http://www.kvp.se/nyheter/1.992641/varldens-fetaste-katt-ar-dod&sl=sv&tl=en (shitty translation from Swedish)]
** ''We put him on a diet, and then he became a little slimmer. But his kidney problems were getting worse and he started to smell bad. Finally, we [[killed]] him.''

== Tubcat Around the World! ==

From humble [[Danish]] origins, Tubcat has [[Pun|grown]] into an international phenomenon. Tubcat is loved not only in Denmark and Sweden, but also in:

== Tubcat on TOW ==

In spite of it being [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubcat legitimately created twice] and in spite of the third revision earning a solid '''Keep''' after its [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tubcat first AfD], the [[Nazis]] at [[Wikipedia]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tubcat_(2nd_nomination) refused to allow there to be an article on Tubcat.] [[Purportedly]], he "''[[Unwarranted self importance|obviously]]'' fails [[Wikipedia:WP:V|WP:V]]" and has "[[Bullshit|no coverage]] in [[Tubcat#Tulle_in_the News|reliable sources]]".
