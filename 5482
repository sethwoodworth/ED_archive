[[Image:Moralfaglulz.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Turning moralfags into lulzcows since 888.]]

'''Moralfags''' are [[chan|*chan]] posters: [[newfags]], who want to harness the power of [[Anonymous]] towards good works in place of [[fail|lulz]] and the continuous accumulation of [[Babyfuck|Japanese pornography]]. Moralfags and [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY|Fail]] are the true cancer killing /b/, after gaiafags and furries. Six independent studies have shown that the only way to treat that cancer is with [[fire]] and [[CP]]. Lots of [[CP]]. In fact, forget the fire.

Moralfags believe that the internet is [[serious business]]. They also believe that [[Project Chanology|they are making shit difference]] in the world by prancing in front of Scientology with Guy Fawkes masks and [[Longcat]] signs without doing it for the lulz. Moralfags can sometimes be found in [[not4chan|pedophile]] and [[gurochan|serial killer]] imageboards telling everyone that they are [[sick fuck|sick fucks]] (which they are) not because [[flame|salting the earth]] is fun, but because they legitimately care if children get [[raep]]ed and if hookers die from something other than [[AIDS]]. A good example of a moralfag is [[WBM|Mark Bunker]], who temporarily turned [[Anonymous]] into a nest of [[fail]].

Independent observers [[some argue|argue]] that Anonymous is a fucking serious business Green-head (see foto right) and the Moralfag or Newfag is the only one who smiles and has fun. This is lolinternet, loooooool.

==Various Breeds of MoralFag==
===Religionfags=== 
[[Image:LadyJ moralfag poster2.jpg|thumb|left|Strict religionfags are on a never-ending crusade to impose their values around the world.]] 
The [[IRL]] version of a Moralfag is a usually a [[Catholic]] or a [[Mormon]]

{{squote|Religion is a means of controlling and exploiting the gullible human population that needs some sort of support and hope to continue through their life.

The Bible was made up by some fags who wanted to control and exploit said population. Every time people donated to the church, it went to the pockets of those fags.

They made up stories and built huge buildings to keep people interested in their stupid beliefs and to keep giving them money.

They even made the early religion compatible with other religions by sharing their holy days and copying their stories/characters.

After 2,000 years of brainwashing, humans accepted this control and live under some moral standards placed hundreds of years ago by some fags.

Here's a modern analogy for you who are too ignorant to understand this:
early prosecution of Christianity: then: prosecution of Scientology: now.

If you don't understand what I'm saying, then fuck you and go on believing that when you die you'll be in a better place, I'll see you all in Hell.|[[Butthurt]], overweight, neckbearded [[atheist]].}}

{{squote|Woah, that's so deep. So that's why every other religion centers around a guy who got really rich instead of, say, being dirt poor and outcast from their society. No one gives a shit if anonymous likes religion or not, that should be the moral of this page. If you think there you are getting lulz out of debating religion, or that you make a difference, you should consider killing yourself.|[[Christfag]], butthurting right back.}}

Half of moralfags protest against Scientology because they believe [[Richard Dawkins|religion is the root of all evil]]. The other half is made up of people who believe [[RejectedDreams|their religion is the ONLY religion]]. Trolling either group is often seen as a waste of time, since they are quite happy to forget what they are protesting about and start screaming and clawing at each other.

==Neutralfags==

[[Image:Cp article.jpg|thumb|left|At least there will always be one thing to unite Anonymous.]]

Neutralfags are the members who try to appear to be free-thinking individuals by criticizing both sides for taking themselves too seriously – older anons and hatefags regard them as little more than hypocritical moralfags who are happy to [[LOLWUT|step on their own kind]] just to avoid looking like [[retards]].

===Lulzfags===
{{squote|Lulzfags are what Anons are meant to be, to begin with. As a result, they see both Moralfags and Hatefags as [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|doing it wrong]], and inconceivably enough, as [[lulzcow|lulzcows]] in their own right, if they can be [[troll|pitted against one another]]. Whether or not lulzfags participate in IRL protests or actually care about seeing to the final destruction of Scientology, they can find endless lulz in trolling hatefags as conscientious do-gooders ([[Zippocat|How dare you laugh about that burning cat!]]), or trolling moralfags as [[HACKERS_ON_STEROIDS|1337 h4xx0r]] [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE|haet masheen]] [[Internet tough guy|internet tough guys]]. 

Many lulzfags understand the [[lulz|highly satirical nature]] of [[Project Chanology]], and some may even see moralfags as [[bullshit|necessary for maintaining Anonymous' public image,]] thus ultimately achieving greater lulz and assuring what will be the most epic win in Internets history. Many lulzfags argue that if hatefags were to read about how Scientology is already [[Marcab|starting to]] [[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY/IRL_PROTEST_PAGE#SCIENTOLOGY'S%20REACTION|become unstable]] [[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY/IDES_OF_MARCH#SCIENTOLOGY'S REACTION|and desperate]] in the face of the Legion, they might [[DISREGARD THAT|change their tune]]. 

If nothing else, this line will make hatefags foam at the mouth and implode into a raging fury of [[BAWWW|bawwwing]] about the epic fail & lulzkilling of [[gay|moralfaggotry]]|The above was written by someone <s>trying to appear unique and failed. Miserably.</s> who probably gets it better than you probably ever will anyway, ya prepubescent hatefag.}}

Lulzfags are a sub-breed of Neutralfag who are trying their best to resemble the old anonymous but of course end up being equally [[USI|self-righteous]]. [[Lie|Of course the old Anonymous was never like that anyway.]]

{{Main|Hatefag}}

[[Image:Hatefag.jpg|thumb|Sadly, moralfags actually think this is hilarious trolling.]]
[[Image:Moralfeds.png|thumb|]]


In response to [[Anti-Protestfag|hatefags]], one moralfag [http://forums.enturbulation.org/showpost.php?p=119585&postcount=8 quipped]:

{{squote|Meh. The idiots who want to attack us moralfags aren't in it for the lulz at all. They have become obsessed with being the [[Internet Hate Machine]], and as the minor, retarded cousins of the moralfags, they fail to realize that in order to effectively spread your hate, you may have to appear nice to get what you want.

We want Co$ to fall. We have found reasons for the general public to help cause the C0$ to fall. Since the general public aren't affected by Anonymous in this raid, they join us. Anonymous will always win.|Anon trying to be the next Machiavelli.}}

Another anon pointed out that due to moralfags, Anonymous now has a new [[Ebaums]] in the CoS. Too bad [[Bitches_Don't_Know|he didn't realize]] that it was actually an elaborate troll by the 7chan mods, and they actually did raid epileptics, lulz.

{{squote|Naw, dudes, naw. Don't ruin a good thing.

Wat?

[http://7chan.org/news.php#67 7chan's newspost], quoted in the other thread. Epilepsy attacks were dugg[http://digg.com/world_news/Church_of_Scientology_attack_epilepsy_forums][http://digg.com/world_news/7chan_response_to_Epilepsy_attack_and_Scientology][http://digg.com/security/Hackers_Assault_Epilepsy_Patients_via_Computer], and all the comments were "Damn Co­S, how low will they stoop?"

We've got ordinary people the world over perpetuating this "war" in [[Anonymous]]' name. For better or worse, as long as that continues, we have people NOT US, WORKING FOR FREE to set us up a new [[Ebaums]].

Everyone knows who "[[Ebaums]]" really is now. Now, without any effort on our part, the rest of the world has chosen a new [[Ebaums]]. [[Anonymous]] forced its way into the general public's psyche as a wight night, crusading force - any wrongs, for the near future, anyway, will be attributed to the [[Scientology|Scien­tologists]].

Co­S attacking MySpace? Co­S attacking epileptics? Co­S attacking furries? OH LAWD!

I think it's fucking hilarious.

Don't [[BAW|bawww]] about what is and isn't attributed to [[Anonymous]]...part of being anonymous means you don't get credit.[http://www.not420chan.com/i/res/121854.html#121963]|Spartoman, [[irony|posting with a tripcode]].}}

[[Image:Cosbx3.png|thumb|left|Three [[sick fucks]] and a moralfag. Together, they fight the [[lulz]].]]

Retarded [[copypasta]] from a neutralfag's view. However, moralfags tend to forget the fact that Scientology is *NOT* Anonymous' target since the rise of Mark Bunker.

{{squote|Moralfags are not [[Anonymous]].

To the moralfags: immediately cease at once what you are doing in the name of [[Anonymous]]. If you are in it for morals as opposed to [[lulz]] you are missing the ultimate irony in wearing a V mask. Was the man in V for Vendetta a 'peaceful protester'? No, he was not. Your efforts are appreciated. But if you're in this for moral reasons, you have no right to call yourself [[Anonymous]], if you already do.

To the anti-moralfags: maybe if you stuck your heads out of your asses you'd realize that most moralfags don't even consider themselves [[Anonymous]]. It says in huge text on [[Enturbulation]], "WE ARE NOT ANONYMOUS". Anonymous' target is the Church of Scientology, that's it. Anonymous' reason for attacking them is "the lulz", and with that sole reason in mind shall true Anonymous continue the war. Anonymous works as one. By attacking the one who is not your enemy (the moralfags), your enemy (Scientology) shall prevail. Look at the original video and abide by all those rules. Anonymous works is one.

The most important thing to remember is ANONYMOUS IS CHAOTIC NEUTRAL. Anonymous does not fight for good. Anonymous does not fight for evil. ANONYMOUS DOES IT FOR THE LULZ. Nevar forget that. When you do, you cease to be Anonymous. BECAUSE ANONYMOUS NEVER FORGETS.|D&Dfag attempting to appear [[internet tough guy|dangerous]].}}

{{squote|[[TL;DR|Let me tell you something, "new Anonymous": If you think that the Chans are hurting your public image, why the fuck are you standing on the streets yelling memes that originated on the very Chan boards that you so denounce? Why are you using Chan terminology while BAWWWWing about how the Chans make you and your pathetic quest look bad? Why did you adopt the name of Anonymous and twist Anonymous culture and then have the temerity to whine about your association with the Chans?<br/><br/>

New Anons, remember how you call your IRL anti-Scientology protests "raids"? Don't you want the public to know the origin of the term "raid", or does that bring to mind those pesky insurgency boards and the "hackers on steroids" that you want to disassociate yourselves from? Don't you want the public to know exactly where the meme "delicious cake" came from? Don't you want the public to know that your beloved #xenu IRC channel is on the same server as #insurgency and #raid (ZOMG hackers! OH NOES!), to name a few? Don't you want the public to know about 711chan (lol, my favorite Chan), where the early planning for Project Chanology took place? Don't you want the public to see some of the more - interesting - boards on 711chan? Don't you, fucktards? Don't you?<br/><br/>

I could go on, but I think this short list is enough to make "new Anons" BAWWWW.<br/><br/>

I know of a certain lying, dangerous cult that tries to present a "good image" to the media while pushing the aspects of their organization that they don't want the public to see into the background. That cult is called Scientology.<br/><br/>

Think about this hard fact long and hard, "new Anons".]]

==Trolling Moralfags==
[[Image:ZIPPOTHREAD.jpg|thumb|[[winrar|DOING IT RIGHT]]!!!]]

Trolling moralfags leads to no lulz, but if you do decide that you want to troll the living fuck out of them, here's what you do.

Step 1: Post [[zippocat]] in /b/.

Step 2: Look at the comments before getting B&.

Step 3: [[????]]

Step 4: [[PROFIT]]

Of course, Moralfags don't see the hypocrisy in their words. They BAWWWW over one dead cat, and yet [[retarded|they don't whine about seeing a person dead]] or better yet [[Internet tough guy|threaten to kill anyone involved]].

* Tell them how pointless their protests are and that all they have achieved is bringing tons of newfags in to ED and 4chan.

===Moralfags on [[TOW]]===

* Get 2 or more people to edit any [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology Scientology] related page, and put in that [[Rorschach|Scientology kills people's cats]].
* Change the TOW articles to say some people say that [[Xenu|Scientology is science fiction]].
* Make edits to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult cult] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_religious_movement new religious movement] articles. The Moralfag admins on TOW are mostly supporters of cults or are cult members themselves (examples [[banhammer|LOL desysopped]] cult members [[Bureaucratic_Fuck#Ed_Poor|Ed Poor]] and [[Jossi]]). Cult members on TOW try to remove mention of the word cult and [[gay|replace it with new religious movement]], a made-up phrase the cults paid [[slave|biased researchers]] [[at least 100]] dollars in [[Jew gold]] to make up and push out.
* Make the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training| EST] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Education| Landmark Education] articles look more like the scientology article. Write that EST was formed by John Paul Jew a used car salesman and use [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,138763,00.html| this] as a reference. When it gets reverted argue what is the difference between "Hubbard, an American writer of pulp fiction, especially science fiction" and "John Rosenburg a seller of cars,especially used cars".
