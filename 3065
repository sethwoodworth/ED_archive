Free

'''Free''' is a deceptive word invented by [[American]] patriots and web ads. Any time you see this word, you are witnessing [[bullshit]], and its source should therefore be completely ignored. Following the word free, there is usually a superscript, that if followed, leads to a ridiculously long [[Internet_Law|legal]] page that explains the extremely rare set of circumstances that must be met for you to get your "Free Gift." Here are examples of some of the fiery hoops you might have to jump through:

*Getting [[pwn]]ed in the ass by [[Bubba]]
*Signing up for 6 free offers, which lead you to signing up for 6 more offers and so on
*Swallowing
*Selling your soul to [[Satan]]
*Adopting a child
