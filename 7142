[[Image:Slappyhtf.jpg|thumb|I think I just died inside.]]

{{deviantart|S-Malone|S-Malone}} is your every day [[lie|original]] [[fucktard|arist]] and [[mindfuck|deep]] [[emo|poet]]. Did I mention he's a  ''[[Happy Tree Friends]]''-obsessed [[basement dweller]]  on [[deviantART]],  and seemingly being divorced from reality in every way possible? S-Malone (or more commonly referred to as "Slappy", the name of his [[true|abomination]] [[furfag]] of a [[mary-sue|fan character]]) brings [[fantard]] to a level only seen in nightmares covered in horse [[shit]]. He portrays himself as a [[lie|virgin]] [[lie|Christian]] [[furfag|California Sea Lion]] named Slappy, who apparently has [[WTF|super powers]].

==The Madness Begins==

In May of 2008, we were introduced to [[Mary-sue|Slappy]], a character with all the charm of an ass tumor and the thought-provoking back story of a sack premature horse balls. [[Autistic]], fucking shaved, mutilated, burned-beyond-return horse balls, that is. Sure, fan characters of pretty much anything are the spawn of Satan himself and should be avoided at all times, but the sheer stomach-wrenching horror this blight against the human race has produced is so unbelievably bad that it falls into a category all its own.

<i>{{quote|Ok my [[powerword|real name]] is stephen a while back i made this here [[magic]] [[portal]] to see my friend Natters but i stayed there in [[Africa|Happy Tree Friend land]] to long so days later i tured into a [[African|Happy Tree Friend]] i still don't kown why, Sniffles did builed me a [[portal]] to take me home and with a little help from my [[wicca|magic]] it worked but instead of takeing me home it set me 20 years into the [[future]] for a sort time there i met Byrants,Natters,Nicks,Sabrinas and even my own [[children]] but when i got back something went wrong with it,It [[WTC|blowed up]] and killed me and Sniffles so now the odds of me geting home are low,So now i'm Slappy,Slappy is a [[Republican|white male]] sea [[lion]] he wears a wetsuit a diving mask and a diveing cylinder unlike most happy tree friends [[Sea nigger|i live in the sea]],I'm a good swimer and i have trouble lifting objects cuz i ain't got no fingers but i can still draw good and Natters and my other happy tree friends have to help me with that and i'm also [[immortal]] and i have vast [[testicle|magicle]] powers,Slappy maybe the most powerful character in Happy Tree Friend land besides Slendid and Sabrina.}}</i>

But as if the journal wasn't already ATROCIOUS ENOUGH, the comments on the journal depicted him answering and replying to all comments in character, horrific spelling and grammar included. Yes, this idiot ACTUALLY seems to think he's a hideously-drawn, horridly-conceived [[furry|anthropomorphic]] seal. 

[[Image: Malone.jpg|thumb|A stroke of brilliant commenting, as always.]]


He is also a major ass kisser. Sucking up to Surfersasquatch10 and Charlieroxz. He constantly demands Charlieroxz to draw him requests. Once Roxz had given in and drawn the faggot a pic regreting. He constantly demands requests off of Roxz, abusing her kindness and generosity. He also takes advantage of everyone else giving out requests. Making them draw his Mary-sue character. And YES MARY-SUE. Because he doesn't deserve Gary-stu.

==The Rise of Evil==

[[Image:Evilly.jpg|thumb|"Mwahahahaha! With my confetti streamers of death, the world will soon be mine!"]]

As if his horrid [[OC|character]] and god-awful back story wasn't enough, we were later introduced to Evilly, a villain only conceivable by a severely  mentally challenged [[13 year old boy|4th grader]].

<i>{{quote|This is Evilly Slappys archenemy he is the most evil being in Happy Tree Friend land he wants to turn Happy Tree Friend land into Hateful Tree Friend land and make Happy Tree Friends his slaves,Slappy use to work for him until he broke free of his mind control thats how he got his powers from him,Slappy is trying his best to beat him so he won't take over.}}</i>

Rest in peace, proper punctuation. You will be sorely missed...

==The Epic Battle==

May 31st saw the release of the simply titled comic of ''Brian and Slappy vs. Evilly'', a comic [[shit|SO revolutionary]] it did away entirely with the concept of text boxes, movement, dialogue, and, well, pretty much anything telling a story. But before we show you this epic groundbreaking saga, we shall give you the backdrop into this powerful emotional roller coaster. Ladies and gentlemen, we bring you...''The Rise of Evil''...

<i>{{Quote|[[under 9000|1,000]] years ago Happy Tree Friend land was ruled by flying squirrels,Sabrinas parents where the [[America|rulers of the planet]] at the time,The planet was beautiful and peaceful for hundreds of years until he came Evilly the crule and evil  ruler of Nightmare land where he came from no one knew but one thing was clear he wanted to make Happy Tree Friend land and the rest of the world his so he used hes demons,robots and the bodys of the deceased Happy Tree Friends he made them into demons under his control soon all of the world became at war,He used some machine to spead Kryptonut radation all over the world soon most of the flying squirrels died from it,At this point Happy Tree Friend land was in [[serious business|serious]] danger the once  beautiful,peaceful land was now in ruins [[Holocaust|millons]] of Happy Tree Friends died in the war,Sabrina parents froze Sabrinas body in ice and put her in some lead machine to save her from Evilly and the Kryptonut radation her parents where then murdered by Evilly as he took over,1,000 years latter Slappy and Zeff found Sabrina and freed her then Zeff and Sabrina fell in love with each other Slappy met there son in the future,Just as all hope seemed lost some unkown wizard possibily Brians ancester did a spell and defeated Evilly and his demons althougt he could not destroy Evilly he imprisoned him in some magic crystal,Now Evilly has somehow escaped and its up to Brian,Sabrina,Slappy and all there friends to stop him.}}</i> 

And now, onto the epic saga of...''Brian and Slappy vs. Evilly''.

'''Note: Any and all semblance of a (horrible) story is told entirely in the description on DA.'''

==The Obsession Continues==

[[Image:Maloneagain.jpg|thumb|Even more brilliant commenting.]]

Slappy is known not only to be a deluded retard living in an imaginary world within a crappy Flash cartoon nobody cares about, but he's also been shown to be a [[chasethehedgehog|self-centered egomaniac]]. He regularly brags about how powerful he is (despite being nothing more than a loser with no life and a warped sense of reality), even going so far as to whore himself out in his so-called "gift-arts." But wait, what does his profile say about this?

Wow, that sure was modest, wasn't it? Certainly, there's <i>no</i> way this guy is a psychotic dweeb with an ego the size of Canada! </sarcasm>

It is believed that association with Slappy will either make you realize just what kind of fucking stupidity you've gotten yourself into and bring you to stop, or it will reveal just what a fucking inbred load of mentally-challenged pond scum you are if you continue to put up with him. Be it his ego, shitty artwork, horrendous writing, or general creepiness, by now most of his former "friends" have left him behind them, walking away a lot wiser knowing that they could follow the same fate. And yet, there's still a load of idiots who not only continue to put up with and socialize with him, but even in some cases producing fanart for him. That's right. This moron has <b>FANART!</b> If that doesn't make you fear for mankind's future, than nothing, and we mean ''nothing'' will.

==Other Notable Gems==

[[Image:Amostunhappybirthday.jpg|thumb|Great! Now I lost my appetite!]]

Slappy's monstrous ego and unwillingness to take any form of critique continues to lead him down the path of luzliness. His artwork and story-telling is still as retarded as ever, and he still refuses to undertake any sort of improvement and keeps staying to his tried-and-true method of producing high-grade dogshit.

One notable, and seemingly discontinued, project called ''Master of Evil'', where we see for the first time the full-scale of his literary ineptitude. Though due to the intervention of a user on DA, all the errors were fixed, producing a more refined and sadly far less lulzy version ([http://s-malone.deviantart.com/art/The-master-of-evil-CH-1-93948485]) But don't be sad, because we've done the honor of preserving this abortion against literature for your viewing pleasure. <b>The following below is the actual story in its original form. No editing, no revisions, no shit.</b>

<i>Slappy Presents… The master of evil (By S-Malone) Chapter 1:The master After Terra THE QUEEN OF NIGHTMARES was defeated little did the demon slayers kown a far grater threat was growing that would destroy all life. Slappy was haveing one of his visons then Brian came into the room very angry. Brian: Slappy Where the hell were you we could have used your help!? Slappy opens his eyes. Slappy:Oh no this can't be! Brian:What?Slappy:Uh nothing Brian i hope so.Brian: You hope so Slappy did you see something?Slappy:No Brian i did'nt see you and the demon lord destroying-Damn it just forget what i said!Slappy walks out the room,Weeks later.Brian:I'm telling ya Cream Slappy saw something bad but he won't tell me what he saw.Cream:Slappy has been acting weird lately.Brian:He said someing about a demon lord.Cream a demon lord whos that?Then the power gos out.Brian:What?Cream:What happened to the power?Brian:Blue!Blue:What?Brian:Is this some kinda joke!?Blue:No Brian see the swich is still on.Brian:Wait wheres Slappy?Destructo man:I bet hes responsible for this i still can't believe you let that stupid sea lion join us!Brian:I'll tell ya what i'm about to club me a seal!Destructo man:Well lets find him.Brian:split up.Brian hears Slappy voice.Brian:What Slappy are you in there?Slappy:No go away!</i>

==Crushing Fetish==



Just when you thought you'd seen the worst. Just when you thought Slappy couldn't make himself look like an even bigger failure, he finds some way to outdo himself. Around July 3rd of 2009, it was revealed that Slappy has a crushing fetish. Through his artwork and comments, it was made public that he is sexually aroused by the idea of being crushed by a woman's foot. Some comments proving are as follows:

{{Quote|"If I was a spider, I'd like for you to step on or sit on me." }}

{{Quote|"I'd like to see you smashed between her toes, spiderfag." }}


{{Quote|"Oh come on if where that small wouldn't you like to be crushed by a hot chick?Theres no better death then that."}}

What's worse is that he actually wrote an erotic fanfiction about it, using other user's OCs without their permission and portraying them grossly out of character. Those of you willing to see natural selection disproved once and for all, please read the carefully preserved and creatively titled <i>Shrink Seal.</i>

{{Quote|Veribear:Yay,Its finally done my shrink ray,With this i can shrink whoever the hell i want!

Veribear:*Walks on the beach*

Slappy:*Walks in a field of flowers which to him is like a jungle*This sucks i'm an inch high,My powers ain't working and Everyone is trying to crush me and everything is trying to eat me!

*Then a frog jumps out of the grass and trys to eat Slappy*

Slappy:*Runs for his life*

*The frog gets scared and hopes away*

Slappy:Huh?*Slappy still runing runs into Wopters foot*

Slappy:*Looks up and sees Wopter*Meep.

Wopter:What a huge bug,I will squash it.

Slappy:*Trys to run away but trips on a pebble so he rolls out of the way,Nearly being crushed*

Wopter:*Lifts up his foot*Aww man i lost him,Oh well.

Slappy:*Climbs up Wopters pants and hides in his pockets,To avoid being seen*

Wopter:*Walks back to his house*

Slappy:*Looking out of his pockets,Slappy sees Veribears house*

Flippine:Bye,Bye.

*The girls lift up there feet*

Slappy:*Face goes pale*Then he gets crushed under foot by Veribear,Jingles,Pichupet and Flippine into a bloody mess. }}

Once this fiction was made public, Veriear's owner,[http://veridiann.deviantart.com/ Veridiann], was, like any sane human being, displeased with her character being used without her consent and used as OOC fetish fuel. So she demanded her character be removed or have the story taken down. Slappy complied and replaced her character with [http://twisted-hope.deviantart.com/ Twisted-Hope]'s fursona, again without permission, and evoked the same results. Only this time, when Twisted-Hope demanded THREE times to have her character removed, he ignored her. It took Veridiann's posting of a journal dedicated to bashing him in order for him to take down the story altogether, which was met with much applause and cheers from the less-retarded wing of the HTF-fanbase. After becoming yet again subject of near-universal ridicule for his sick fetish, he tried to become "tough" by trying (and failing miserably) at trolling.





==Pedophile life==

[[Image:slappy-Copy.jpg|thumb|His true form.]]

On the Happy Tree Friends Social Site S-malone claimed to be 'in love' and 'wanting to hit' 13 year old Charlieroxz. 

This is creepy and lulzy because Malone claims to be 20 and Roxz claims to be 13 and in a relationship.



One of his SICK AS FUCK QUOTES about Charlieroxz's [[tits|'rack']]-


{{Quote| Yeah rocks may be a bitch but she has a 'hell of a nice rack' have you seen those tits?! DAMN they are huge! I wanna fuck so bad! shes like Daisy Dukes! Only younger! turns me on.

~S-malone }}


He showed his pedo when he said he 'wanted to fuck roxz',that she has a 'nice rack', and he would [[rape|hold her down and fuck her on the spot if he ever saw her]]. He also said she was a Sexy Norwegian Asian with a hot Filipino mother. Although he claimed that she was also a clueless hoe and a bitch. He also knows Roxz's last name and her hometown. And looks forward to when she comes to his state so he can fuck his 'Sexy Norwegian'. According to this our Pedo Senses should be tingling.
