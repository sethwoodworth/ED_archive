''Prolly not to be confused with [[Bestiality Boy]]. [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.music.beastie-boys/browse_thread/thread/8ba427a471fd05fa/fb8ddc3485f44525 Then again...]''

Three richJew [[New York City|NYC]] Jew [[wigger]] [[troll]]s who made history in the mid [[Last_Thursday|80's]], beating Vanilla Ice to the fag-slap in pulling an [[victim complex|Al Jolson]] on [[black]]s by snaking their culture and taking it all the way to the bank via the multi-million selling [[college|frat]] boy party/comedy album '''"License To Ill"'''. 

==The Beastie Boys: IRL Trolls==

Known as much for their [[prank|hilarious hijinx]] and [[13-year-old boy|juvenile behavior]] on and off stage, they were nonetheless A+ [[IRL Troll]]s who conned all their fanboys and the entire media into believing things like: that they had drilled a hole in a hotel floor to the room below to pass stuff back and forth to each other. Nobody ever [[Calling bullshit|called them out]] on this stuff because it <i>is</i> entirely plausible that a bunch of heavy construction equipment being lugged into a high-class hotel and hours of noise drilling a hole would go unnoticed. Their early trolling behaviour is evident in the 1987 home video '''License To Ill''', which the band has tried to keep out of print but could not stop being released on teh [[internets]].

They also had a 21' hydraulic [[penis|pen0r]] built as a stage prop which remained hidden in an equipment case until the final song of the night -'''"[[Party Hard|Fight For Your Right To Party]]"'''- at which point it would rise to a boner of epic proportions. This along with a caged [[stripper]] and copious amounts of cursing, [[balls|crotch-grabbing]] and flying [[beer]] was [[lulz]] of the highest order.

But one man's lulz are another man's [[butthurt]] and the [[parents|concerned citizens]] of many US cities worked hard to have the Beastie Boys banned based on media reports and reviews of their shows and [[stupid|crazy]] [[rape|after-partying]]. In fact, after reports of a night of booze and [[Whippet]] fueled 'car tipping' in Zurich (and the subsequent [[permaban]] from [[Switzerland]]) followed by news of them trolling a [[retard]]ed kid at the airport, they were issued a lifetime ban from the [[UK]].

After lengthy [[bribery|negotiations]] the UK ban was lifted so the Beastie Boys could continue trolling [[Europe]], most notably by starting a riot amongst rival [[Liverpool]] football hooligans in the middle of a show. The theatre was [[ruin|trashed]] by drunken '''Scouse Gits''' and many were IRL hurt as the crowd threw half full cans of beer and seats at each other to and from the balcony.

By the time the cops arrived, the Beastie Boys had scarpered off to London to avoid being [[pwnt]] for the troll but the cops had the last laugh when they called their pals in London's [[cops|Old Bill]] to [[jail|detain]] one of the three for standing on the stage and using a baseball bat to hit beer cans back into people's faces.

==[[Pool's Closed|After The Party Ended]]==

However, they ultimately made only [[at least 100]] bucks because their [[black|Uncle Tom]] manager, [[GNAA|Russell "Colonel (Uncle) Tom Parker" Simmons]], ripped them off after spending all their ill-gotten gains on [[crack]]. This was only a taste of the irony-fest to come.

Penniless and crying, they moved to [[Los Angeles|helLA]] to sell their lily white asses on Santa Monica Bvd. as pre-op [[transsexual]] [[prostitute|rent boys]]. It was here that they met Crapitol Records executive John Fagot and druggy producer/Axl Rose wannabe Matt Dike and ended up making a bizarre, [[drug]]-addled concept album ('''"Paul's Boutique"'''), lyrically inspired by "TV Guide".  

Little is known about the Beastie Girls' [[period]]s after this album tanked, though the bleeding was plentiful. When they reappeared hanging off the (hello) Dalai Lama's nutsack in the mid '90s, they appear to have had the enormous [[penis|cocks]] of the [[furry|Giant Tibetan Ghey Yak]] wedged firmly up they [[ass]]es and sutured shut by Mr. Lama himself.

==[[Born Again]]==
[[File:Beastie_boys_trolls_remorse.png|thumb|300px|Classic [[troll's remorse]].]]
At this point they embarked upon the [[whining bitch|"What the fuck is that shit?"]] stage of their careers, recording an infinite collection of self-indulgent, [[emo|'spiritual']] crap including traditional, [[Tibetan]] throat-music "come-hither" ballads to get in underage [[azn|Asian]] girls' pants and further fuck up the teeny minds of their fans. 

Despite their early albums featuring such [[lulz|lol]][[loli|(i)]] lyrics as: 

{{quote|If I was a guitarist I'd be Jimmy Page, the girlies I like are underage!|[Mike D, "The New Style" from "License to Ill"]}}

...their later material found them moving away to topics such as [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|'''buddhism''']] and [[Asking_for_it|respecting women]].

They dedicated this work to Mr. Lama's [[balls]] in a lame attempt to atone for all the rhyming, stealing, statutory [[rape|raping]], and trashing of dressing rooms/hotels on the "License To Ill Tour". However, Mr. Lama dismissed the newly named [[furry|"Yeasty Girls"]]&mdash;and [[music]] in general&mdash;as being [[nobody gives a shit|"unimportant"]], and because His Holiness the Dalai Lama is a [[Buddha|Buddhist]] and as such, [[IDIFTL|does everything for the lulz]].

This was a textbook case of [[irony|Textbook Irony]], however&mdash;unlike any credibility they ever had&mdash;they weren't over and went on to make irony history when&mdash;in a last ditch attempt to jock the Dalai Lama&mdash;they publicly disowned their pre-[[anal sex|penis-in-ass]] recorded history. The irony? [[irony|Perfect Storm Irony]], where all forms of irony collide and cause [[irony|Delayed Reaction Irony]].

See, the original title of "License To Ill" was "Don't Be A [[Faggot]]" but [[The Man]]&mdash;ironically a [[Lyor Cohen|Jewish The Man]]&mdash;at DefJam Records wouldn't let them use it. 

So not only is/was it ironic that they were tres [[ghey]] for fagging out at the time, they are/were [[gay|"The Winningest Faggots Ever"]], for disowning "Don't Be A Faggot" aka "License To Ill".

==[[Last Thursday|Today]]==

Today, the Beastie Girls are actually three, [[at least 100|way over 50-year]]-old, postmenopausal [[feminist|FemiNazis]] who imagine they're still [[gay boys|boys]] performing PG13 rated raps for [[Tibet]]&mdash;and [[pussies]]&mdash;in deh "[[Old School]] 4 Da [[intellectual|Old Fools]]" cabaret at "Russel Simmons Def Illegal Crap Game" in [[Vegas]].

Typical Fan&mdash;30-something tosspots convinced that liking this band means they're [[cool|"down with the kids"]] ... or [[George Lucas|Spike Jonze]].
