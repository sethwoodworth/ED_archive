YouTube Commentaries
[[Image:Everycommentatorever.jpg|thumb|No, recycling [[meme]]s is never going to help. Ever.]]

Commentaries are [[MST3K|a new and original concept]], in which a person gives their opinions or thoughts on a video while it plays. On [[YouTube]], this is considered to be a new fad, and bandwagon headed for YouTube stardom. Nowadays, a majority of commentaries are made by [[newfags]] and those who fail to be funny, talking over shitty game reviews and Sonic recolor slideshows. However, [[Winrar|when done right]], commentaries can generate massive [[drama]] and [[lulz]] for all.

==Origins==
{{main|Let's play with YouTube}}
[[Image:Retsupurae_logo.jpg|thumb|88px|left|The (Channel) [[Doom|Icon of Sin]].]]

YouTube commentaries in their popular form did not get their start on YouTube: The scene's origins can be traced back to [[Something Awful]], and the "[[Let's Play]]" genre. [[At least 100 years ago]], a nerd of [[Obese|epic proportions]] named [[Slowpoke|Slowbeef]] posted the very first Let’s Play on Something Awful. Eventually, the idea of talking over video games became extremely popular, and every fucking [[goon]] on the website got in on the action. This then was passed on to YouTube, and from that point forward, LPs were ridden with bad video quality quality, horrible gaming skills, and squeaky [[Shota|prepubescent]] voices. However, since only [[GameFAGs]] users did this, the rest of the YouTube cool kids did not care much for them.

Slowbeef, [[Pwned|disgusted]] by what had become of his [[Shit|creation]], plotted his revenge. And on that day, [[Retsupurae]] was born. As the self-proclaimed father of LPs ''(And eventually YouTube commentary itself)'', Slowbeef believes he has a god-given right to stick [[Fuck you|the middle finger]] at other LPers. The formula was simple: Find awful LP videos on YouTube, get some goons to commentate with him and then proceed to lay [[unfunny|witty commentary]] over said LP videos.

{{squote|1=[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWeJN5P7skA When it comes to Lets Play, you can find just about every color of the rainbow if you know where to look. You got your funny Let's Plays, your informative Let's Plays, and your narrative Let's Plays that make up all the colors found in Skittles. Unfortunately, if you look in the wrong places, you can find the shit-browns and vomit-greens of camcorder Let's Plays, self-proclaimed game reviewer Let's Plays, and singalong Let's Plays. ... If quality Let's Plays are what you're looking for, you're in the wrong place, because today... Retsupurae!]}}

Despite the fact that many in the LP community were [[butthurt]] over their videos being talked over, others in the YouTube community adored them. Because their videos received so much praise, comments, notoriety and [[YouTube Ratings|good ratings]], many decided to [[plagiarism|imitate them]] in a [[desperate]] attempt to become e-famous. And so, history repeated itself once again, and Slowbeef had spawned another gay [[fad]] completely [[Just as planned|unintentionally]].

==The Current State of Commentaries==
[[Image:DarkAngeltheLight.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Lolicon|DarkAngeltheLight]] jumping on the bandwagon, with [[Fag|L]] as her own representation.]]

As with every other [[unfunny]] bandwagon and fad, commentaries have spread throughout YouTube like a fucking [[cancer]]. What started with a couple of goons recording mildly amusing commentaries, now has [[YouTube Nobodies|wannabe e-celebrities]] recycling old memes and jokes in their [[desperate]] attempts to appeal to [[4chan]].

There are two schools of thought behind YouTube commentaries: [[Trolling|Doing it for the lulz]], and [[Attention whore|doing it because it's popular]]. Seeing as this is [[YouTube]] we're talking about here, it should come as no surprise to anyone that the majority of commentators subscribe to the latter theory. As such, you will usually find their criticisms to be half-hearted and their jokes to be quite weak, whereas commentaries by trolls typically focus on [[obese|fat jokes]] and other lines intended to get a reaction out of the victim.

<s>What’s sad about this [[AIDs|manifestation]] of commentaries</s> Count your fucking blessings children, because most of the YT commentators have yet to notice that Retsupurae has done more outside of Let’s Plays. None of the bandwagoners have gone to comment on anything new but, would rather stick to the same thing and just hope for good feedback, thus stifling any chance of them actually becoming as popular as their idol. Retsupurae has commented on [[Video Game Reviewers|game reviews]], [[fan fiction]], videos calling them out and even [[flash]]es from [[Newgrounds]].

The few that have branched out and commented on non-LPs have generated drama comparable ''(or even beyond that generated)'' to the original Retsupurae. This is due in part to the fact that RP's involvement ends with their commentaries. Smaller groups, which can afford to walk the fine line between [[MST3K|riffing]] and blatant [[trolling]], will sometimes continue to harass their targets after their original commentary is said and done, until they [[an hero|quit the Internet forever]] or until they themselves are banned.

==Notable Commentators==
Commentators may be considered "Notable" for a number of reasons. These include ''(But are not limited to)'' being [[Funny|legitimately amusing]], consistently [[Trolling|generating drama]], or being [[overrated]] [[Shit|garbage]] that does a better job of demonstrating how fucking [[retarded]] the population of [[YouTube]] is rather than demonstrating the positive qualities of commentaries. In other words, these commentary channels can be classified as being members of "The Good" ''(Channels which seek to and succeed to amuse)'', "The Bad" ''(Channels which exist solely for their own greed)'', or "The Ugly" ''(Channels that exist only to piss people off)''.

[[Image:Armake_dox.png|thumb|right|Armake inadvertently confirming his own dox on YouTube.]]
[[Image:Armake21-Drawing-Raep.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Drawing images of [[loli]] [[bondage]].]]

'''Armake21''' AKA '''NicotineAlien''' AKA '''theFAILSessions''' AKA '''BoxedEntertainment21''' ''(Real name: Marcus Sparacio)'' is a [[Crap|vastly overrated]], [[bald|slap headed]], hypocritical, egocentric 25-year-old [[Video Game Reviewers|video game reviewer]] whom originated from [[YouTube|JewTube]]. He is instantly recognizable by his irritating ''Winnie the Pooh'' voice, and his bizarre ability to grow hair on the wrong side of his head. Armake21 originally decided to board the [[video game]] reviewing bandwagon, after seeing how [[popular]] and rich the [[Angry Video Game Nerd]] had become. Being the [[money]] grabbing Jew that he is, he also wanted a slice of the pie, but he never managed to catch on despite tossing the word "[[Fail]]" around a thousand times per video ''(Which is usually enough to hook children and newfags)''.

Then, having noticed the emerging popularity of [[Retsupurae]] and wishing to "get in good" with [[goons]] ''(Who had previously mocked him)'', Marcus opened a commentary channel titled {{youtube2|TheFailSessions|TheFailSessions}}, with which he released commentaries over videos by other rival video game reviewers in a [[desperate]] attempt to cover up his own inadequacies as a reviewer. Targets have included the likes of [[PissedOffVideoGamer]] and [[Video Game Reviewers#Navgtr .2F Gaming in the Clinton Years|Navgtr]], which should be enough to tell you that he deliberately picks popular targets for the purpose of [[Attention Whore|inflating his view count]]. Luckily, there have been no new commentaries for over a year, and we can only hope that it continues to remain that way.

Armake recently ''(Earlier this year)'' announced the return of TheFailSessions on the channel's "Recent Activity" box, but has yet to release any new commentaries to mark this comeback. He continues to update {{youtube2|BoxedEntertainment21|his personal channel}}, which is also host to several FailSession episodes and other miscellaneous [[unfunny]] commentaries, in addition to his regularly scheduled program of [[unfunny]] video game reviews of [[Shit nobody cares about|awful old games nobody cares about]].

Marcus serves as a prime example of everything that commentaries [[Doing it wrong|should not be]]: His [[USI|self-serving]], [[Attention whore|populist]], [[Trolls remorse|half-hearted]] rants over footage of other people talking over video games are a disservice to the commentary genre. [[John Solomon|His commentaries are bad, and he should feel bad]].

[[Image:Boomstickwhore.gif|thumb|640px|center|Reminding us [[Attention whore|why he joined the commentary game in the first place]].]]

Boomstick545 is a [[Pokémon]] [[fanboy]] (read: [[furry]]) who submits [[unfunny]] commentaries for the sole purpose of having his name posted on [[ED]]. He seems to have an [[Fetish|unnatural obsession]] with [[Pikachu]], as he inserts pictures of him into all of his commentaries, abruptly stopping the video so he can [[BAWWW]] about what has already occurred. Sitting through his commentaries is painful, as his method actually [[Stupid|doubles the length of the videos he is commenting on]].

He preaches to his [[retards|fans]] that <i>ANYONE</i> can do YouTube commentaries, so long as you have a working copy of [[Windows Movie Maker]] and laymen's knowledge of [[unfunny|popular]] [[4chan]] memes. He is known for flaunting the fact that he is <s>[[bisexual]]</s> [[fag|a flaming fucking faggot]] to draw attention to himself ''(The same reason he does commentaries, coincidentally enough)''.

His targets consist of [[Old meme|hasbeen]] faggots that [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody fucking cares about anymore]]. These include ''(But are not limited to)'' [[Alexander4488]], [[Chris-Chan]], and [[Spax3]]. This is just further proof that he joined the movement to become e-famous, as he deliberately picks "popular" targets with [[ED]] articles in the vain hope that his videos will be reposted here in a positive light. So, to deliberately annoy him, here are a few of his videos with nasty comments under them reminding [[you]] how [[shit]] they really are. [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|Scratch that:]] They've all disappeared along with his horrid channel. Good fucking riddance.

[[Spies|Sources]] within Boomstick's [[Circlejerk|circle of e-friends]] allege that the reason for Boomstick's shutting down his channel is due to him being "[[Sick]]"; not in the "[[Flounce|tired of doing commentaries]]" sense, but in the "[[Swine Flu|legitimately ill]]" sense. Though he apparently did not disclose his specific ailment, there is a [[srsly]] good chance that he has contracted [[AIDS]], due his [[Faggot|numerous encounters]] with unprotected [[cock]].

===ChipCheezumSA===
[[Image:Chipcheezum.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Chip Cheezum is smart enough to not post his face on the internet. Go figure.]]

ChipCheezumSA is the name of a commentary channel run by [[goons]] Chip Cheezum and General Ironicus ''([[Gay|Guess who wears the pants in this relationship]]?)''. They hold the dubious "honors" of having had Slowbeef guest commentate with them in the past, and being moderators of the [[Something Awful]] LP subforum ''(Where this whole fad got started)''. Being goons themselves, they are frequently compared to the original Retsupurae, and are even mistakenly considered to be the origin of the movement itself by [[stupid]] [[newbies]]. Their commentaries are actually amusing every now and again, or at the very least, leaps and bounds ahead of those not produced by proper goons.

[[Plagiarism|They follow closely in Retsupurae's footsteps]], wherever they may lead, like an abandoned puppy follows a [[shota|boy on his way home from school]] in a cheesy 50's series. When RP began commenting on non-LP videos, ChipCheezumSA followed suit. When their role models began commenting over [[Newgrounds|flash animations]], they did the same. It is expected that when Slowbeef dies, [[An hero|they too shall release themselves from this mortal coil]]. Until then, they shall continue to spark mild drama with their commentaries.

[[Image:DCE.png|thumb|150px|[[No|Izzint he gud artist guiz?]]]]
[[Image:RandomDCE.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Plagiarism]] at it's finest.]]

RandomDCE is a [[British]] [[furfag]] with a huge fan base consisting of brain-dead [[shota]]s. DCE became a member of the [[YouTube Nobodies|YouTube Hall of Fame]] by posting boring rant videos about [[shit nobody cares about]], and by incorporating his own amateur sprite animations into his videos in a [[desperate]] attempt to win over his fans with [[Angry Video Game Nerd|gimmicky special effects]]. Needless to say, these videos are as about [[Unfunny|as funny as being diagnosed with cancer]], and his fans ''(Who would like nothing more than to find him [[IRL|in real life]] and suck his European furry cock)'' are legitimately [[Aspies|mentally defective]].

[[Video game]] related videos are DCE favorite fodder for commentary, since he knows perfectly well that these videos ''(As overplayed as commentaries over them are)'' will provide him with the only thing he cares about on [[YouTube]]; subscribers. He was also partly responsible for the [[Sonic]] recolor fad, despite later creating anti-Sonic recolor groups. He also claims that, as a sprite [[Autistic|"artist"]], he abhors any form of recoloring. [[Ironic]] that he does the same [[shit]] as recolors, as anyone with eyes can see they all his characters share the same body depending if they are [[fat]], [[furry]], [[female]] or short. Not to mention that all of his characters are based off other YouTube users or are obviously based off already existing characters, such as the image on the right where his [[fursona]] is based off that of [[Animaniacs|Dot]].

He is also responsible for leading another commentary group by the name of {{youtube2|JetDroidMonkey2007|JetDroidMonkey2007}}, which features commentaries just as bad as those on his personal channel. The difference between them and his own is that JDM commentaries usually feature over 4 other [[unfunny]] [[YouTube Nobodies|commentators]] talking over the video ''(Not to mention, each other)'' at the same time, resulting in consistent [[clusterfuck]]s. You shouldn't wish the [[Hell]] of watching these awful commentaries upon your worst enemies.

===[[Alexander4488]]===
[[Image:Alex4488lol.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The look on Alexander's face when he successfully takes down a commentary.]]

Alexander4488 is a smug [[Canadia]]n “film student” who – You guessed it - reviews [[video game]]s. Alexander is yet another one of the many [[AVGN|angry nerd]]s, a [[terrorist]] and also claims to attend the [[Shit|Vancouver Film School]]. Like the rest of the herd of vidy gaem addicts, Alexander does an incredibly bad job at reviewing. Following along the cliché angry nerd act, Alexander screams at minor, if not unnoticeable, problems. He also desperately fishes for possible sex jokes, usually involving the [[penis]], as a poor attempt to make his crowd of [[virgin]]s laugh.

As a [[smug]] video game reviewer, he thinks that his videos are the best on YouTube, and even thinks that he is better than the Angry Nintendo Nerd. He believes that everyone should [[USI|five-star]] his videos, believing that is what they actually deserve. However, if there he finds any form of negativity – whether in comment or video form, he will track the person down and personally [[BAWWW]] to them.

Although METOKUR began initial trolling with [http://vimeo.com/11700634 their commentary over his review of Barbie for the NES], they abandoned ship once other commentators decided to cash in, and [[Sic|basica]] blew the whole operation. Commentary channels continue to produce unwatchable videos to this day, all of which Alexander inevitably [[Ego|responds to himself]]. In fact, after one of [[Gay|Boomstick]]'s commentaries over Alexander’s atrocious [[Rainbow Road|Mario Kart]] review was discovered by Alexander, he replied to every single comment on the video, [[USI|rebutting their views]].

[[Image:Big Al.jpg|thumb|His [[Shit|beautiful]] intro.]]

'''BigAl2k6''', AKA Alan D. Reddig, is a [[fat]] VLogger nerd and general self-esteem booster for those around him. Proclaiming himself to be the "[[Faggot|rant master]]", he often uploads boring rant videos concerning [[Shit nobody cares about|topics people stopped caring about]] [[Last Thursday]], like [[PETA]], [[FF7]], [[Dylan Tnga|Tourneyfags]], and [[Bullshit|other bullshit]]. When he isn't busy complaining about [[shit nobody cares about]], he also posts videos of himself [[LOL WUT|dancing for his webcam]], [[AMV]]s, video game reviews, and kissing [[animu]] girls ''([[Srsly]])''.

As such, he has become somewhat popular commentary fodder, including a commentary by the original [[Retsupurae]] over a video of him {{youtube|gpYbJBQNcIc|demonstrating the moves he would have if he were to star in a fighting game}}, and a commentary by METOKUR over a video of him [http://vimeo.com/11705066 dancing to a J-Pop song from a video game for furries]. In a [[desperate]] attempt to dissuade commentators from producing more videos, he hopped on the bandwagon himself, [[obese|nearly crushing it with his massive girth]]. They contain the same needless swearing from his rant videos, but with the added benefit of not having to look at him while he talks. They're still as [[unfunny]] as ever, though.

===[[Irate Gamer]]===
[[Image:Irapegamer.png|thumb|left|160px|You better heed these warnings, dear commentators.]]

'''Chris Bores''', also known as '''The Irate Gamer''', is a lulzless YouTube user, pretending to be a gamer, who thought there weren't enough [[Angry Video Game Nerd]] ripoffs on the internets. On April 28th, 2007, Irate Gamer put up a review of Back to the Future for the NES that was AVGN's exact review with his voice dubbed over, making the same exact points on Marty's vest, his skateboard, the game's enemies and mimicking James' exact body movements with his controller by using a pirated copy Sony Vegas on a computer that he traded cocaine to some black person for. Since then, he has been the subject of many a YouTube video, including several commentaries over his reviews.

Unfortunately, the bulk of these commentaries ''(As well as most videos to use his likeness in any form)'' have been [[BAWWW|taken down]] due to copyright claims [[Butthurt|filed by Bores himself]]. Among these "[[I See What You Did There|Casualties of Bore]]" includes a video by Retsupurae themselves, which shocked their subscribers and anti-Bore fanatics by not being a commentary over one of his game reviews. Instead, they talked over a video of him [[Plagiarism|blatantly ripping off Ghost Hunters]]. Soon after this commentary was taken down, [http://www.somethingawful.com/d/webcam-ward/irateghosts.php a remake of the commentary was released on Something Awful], where it is safe from Bore's touch of death.

===[[Batshit Insane|Navgtr / Gaming in the Clinton Years]]===
[[Image:Jack_Thompson_Review.jpg|thumb|left|"George Wood," robotic television hosting machine.]]

Also known as, <b>"The Argument Against YouTube Commentaries"</b>.

[[Jack Thompson|Jack Thompson's]] attempt in the 1990's to become a [[facepalm|legitimate video game critic]]. In these "reviews," Jack discusses his [[shit|brilliant]] video game ideas, such as giving [[Tomb Raider|Lara Croft]] [[cancer|breast cancer]], [[boring|driving the speed limit while taking a woman to the labor ward]], and [[irony|playing as a batshit insane lawyer who must defend himself for mailing gay porn to a judge]]. At some point in 2006, these videos were seen by the [[lolwut|National Academy of Video Game Testers and Reviewers]], and were reposted on YouTube, where they remained obscure and unseen.

That is, until Retsupurae stumbled upon it, and released a {{youtube|5s0lzbCK9f8|series}} {{youtube|iiZxFYNtyh8|of}} {{youtube|hEaGhweF1g0|commentaries}} {{youtube|G3QpyWKOZ74|over}} {{youtube|yXzxJjIXHik|the}} {{youtube|M8LFOVGUt2g|antiquated}} {{youtube|T8vhGSm0rfw|episodes}}. [[Doing it wrong|Believing the series to be recent]], these commentaries consisted mostly of them discussing how dumb it was for a channel to be reviewing decade-old games as if they were recent. Unfortunately, RP's fans never so much as questioned this gross inaccuracy, believing them to be [[religion|infallible]]. Worse yet, many began to produce their own "Navgtr commentaries", recycling the same tired jokes from the original RP commentaries.

As a result, if you watch any of these [[unfunny|awful commentaries]], any humor you might find in the ineptitude of the original show will be ruined for you. So, do yourself a favor, and don't watch any of them ''(The commentaries, that is)'', for they are the prime example of how YouTube commentaries can fucking drain the [[lulz]] dry.
