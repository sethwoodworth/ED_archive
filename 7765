[[Image:StLouisArch.jpg|thumb|right|All your skyline are belong to Francis Slay]]
'''Saint Louis''' is a city in eastern [[Missouri]] ([[moar]] like "Misery", [[amirite]]?) populated by niggers and and their white overlords.  Prior to the erection of a coat hanger, it was called the Mound City due to the strange and [[Boobs|mysterious mounds]] of dirt piled in nearby [[Illinois]] by Indians who [[The Rapture|dissappeared]] for the [[LULZ]].

St. Louis City is separate from St. Louis County.  So they are two different counties identified easily by what part of town looks less like shit.

== Weather? ==
WHAT DA WEATHER GON BE?!?!?!
RAIN RAIN RAIN COLD AND RAIN. THIS IS ALWAYS TRUE. ALWAYS.

== Transportation ==
[[Image:FrancisSlay.jpg|thumb|left|Mayor Francis Slay]]
Due to cutback by the Metro Transit system, the best way to get around town is by psychic levitation since Metro does not go to nearby Madison County in [[Illinois]] (for fear of being sued), St. Clair County in Illinois (for fear of black people), St. Louis County (black people), St. Louis City (Mayor Francis Slay...oh and black people), Jefferson County (rednecks), Franklin County (rednecks), or St. Charles County (Lori Drew and rednecks), you cannot take the bus or train anywhere.

Because the transit system is bullshit, travelers usually enjoy the airport with the LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG runway that is 8 miles long.  They can also enjoy Union Station, a train station that became a mall, but it now just a mostly empty building. (YAY PROGRESS!)

== Architecture ==
Paul McKey has a plan for North St. Louis, but the niggers who live their don't want it.  So the primary architectural feature that sticks out most in the city are abandon vacant houses that have been boarded up, set on fire, or left to literally crumble so that [[Weed|plants]] can reclaim the property.  But even that won't convince them to allow for redevelopment because Paul McKey is a [[White|honkey]].

== Educationz ==
The childrenz in the city theyz not be learning.  [[School]] board is shit.  The parents act like [[13 year old boys]] and [[12 year old girls]].

[[Scientology|L. Ron Hubbard]] tried to take advantage of [[crap|No Child Left Behind]] in 2003 by attempting to offer [[rape|tutoring]] to childrenz who kan't lern guud.  But they [[Chris Hansen|got busted]] by a local [[Xenu|whistle blower]].<sup>[http://www.holysmoke.org/cos/crime-syndicate-in-st-louis.htm]</sup>

[[Ironically]], St. Louis is the home of [[NO U|Wash U]], probably the best university in the Midwest. Everyone in attendance rightfully gets the fuck out of Missouri when they graduate.

== Violence and the Police ==
North St. Louis City has the most violence.  Some criminals are dumb enough to go into St. Louis County where an [[Psychopath|undercover cop]] is likely to kill them for carjacking, robbing [[16 year old girls]] or just being a dick.

Contrarly, if they do make it back into the city, the new chopper records their well deserved ass kicking, and it becomes a civil rights issue.  Never mind the black person shot a police officer, stole somebody's iPod, and raped some kid.  LAUDY! THAT'S OPPRESSION!

Corruption in the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department has occured in the past few adminstrations.

Former Police Chief Joe Mokwa bailed his daughter out of jail right about at the same time the Police got partyvanned by the FBI for the cars they impounded.  Mokwa resigned.

Now the new Administration is being watched by the FBI right about the same time the city wants to be set free from state control that the SLMPD doesn't want fearing the penions would be affected.

But Commissioner Vincent Bomarrito didn't care. He used his power to bail out his son who was arrested for public drunkenness at the St. Louis Mari Gras celebration on March 13, 2010.  Bomarrito resigned.

===WARNING! NIGGERS WILL KILL YOU!===
With School being out and nothing on TV, groups of niggers from North St. Louis City have decided to go hunting for other niggers to kill and a few white people as well.  A meeting by local leaders as to how to fix [[jews|the problem]] yielded the reason why niggers kill lately. One response was "[[Boredom]]".
The killings lately have been break-ins, but no valuables were stolen--the objective seems to be just to kill.

===ATTENTION NIGGERS: THE COPS ARE TIRED OF YOUR BULLSHIT!===
Starting as of [[Last Thursday|late November 2010/early December 2010]], the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department will be much harder to shoot at. SWAT team style police will be showing up in the hood.  If you shoot a cop, you better kill yourself. If you shoot a kid in a freak stray bullet accident, you better kill yourself.  Kill a future athlete, scientist, or other person trying to get out of the hood, you better kill yourself.  Because if you don't, the cops will come and kill you.  The offer to kill yourself will expire on [[5/21/2011]] when killing yourself might not be an option.  So form a suicide cult. Make some [[kool-aid]] and [[fried chicken|fry that chicken]] and eat your [[watermelon]] before the cops, the white man, or JEE-SUS kill you.  Because from here on out, unless you were the best runner on your high school track team, the po-po will have their big guns out and not even a Kenyan can outrun their shit!

== Jobs ==
In your grandparents days, St. Louis was home to many industries, including areospace, automobiles, [[meth|chemical manufacturing]], telecommunications, and trade.

But that was then.  Today, most St. Louisans aren't even qualified to work at the local fried chicken restaurant where they spend their [[unemployment|welfare check]].  Since the recession in 2008, many places have fired all their [[16 year old girls]] and hired alot of [[your mom|middle aged women]] who [[Bernie Madoff|used up their 401k]] at the various [[Jews|Casinos]] in the area.  But hey, gambling supports edjewkayshun, [[amirite]]?

One of the biggest supporters of the [[unemployed]] has been [[Republican|Missouri State Senator Cynthia Davis]], and owner of a Christian Bookstore, who serves as chairwoman of the Missouri House Special Standing Committee on Children and Families think that if hungry children want to eat, they should get a fucking job.

::''"Anyone under 18 can be eligible? Can’t they get a job during the summer by the time they are 16? Hunger can be a positive motivator. What is wrong with the idea of getting a job so you can get better meals? Tip: If you work for [[McDonald’s]], they will feed you for free during your break."''<sup>[http://thinkprogress.org/2009/06/21/cynthia-davis-hunger/]</sup>

The most popular job in the St. Louis Area at the moment appears to be Registered Sex Offender.

** Shit on the shit transit system! Grand Metrolink station is covered with bird shit and niggers! Of course this station is being redesigned because St. Louis University wanted something better to look at.
** The Transit system has recently been upgraded from Shit to Crap thanks to Proposition A after some retard from the St. Louis Tea Party name John Burns though it would be a better idea to have Metro pay disabled riders money to buy a cars instead of raising money to restore the transit system.  A [[sudden outbreak of common sense]] occurred and the proposition passed nearly 2 to 1.  [[Some argue]] that the passage of this proposition would help disestablish the Tea Party. Apparently not, because [[Roy Blunt]] was elected Senator, and several [[Pre-emtive Strike|pre-emptive tax measures]] were passed, and funded by Tea Party and [[Libertarian]] supporters including [[Libertarian|Rex Sinquefield]].

Former Florissant Police Chief, now asshole mayor.  Used to work for the local [[Partyvan|Major Case Squad]].  Is mayor of a city with 1/6th the population of St. Louis City, but gets paid 3 times more than St. Louis Mayor Francios Slay. Works 4 hours per day, sleeps most of the day, is paid a six figure sallery.  Hires a [[Buy A Dog|$50,000 bodyguard]] out of fear that [[terrorists]] might kill him.  [[Never drinking again|"Doesn't drink anymore."]]  Once a outstanding cop, now a paranoid old man. In December 2010, Bob Sr. announced that he would not run for mayor at the next election citing "the evil political system". (Actually, he probably read this article exposing his dirty little secret in this paragraph. Hi, Bob!)
** Robert Lowery, Jr. - The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Bob, Jr. used to be the City Adminstrator for O'Fallon, Missouri, before he tried to usurp a local wildlife area that was popular for hunters and fishermen.  Bob, Jr. wanted it in hopes that it would be accessible for the urban sprawl that St. Charles County has.  Needless to say, the owners of the area, the state, and the people who frequented the area were not too happy about that. He was fired. Bob, Jr. now works for the Obama Adminstration for some organization for Law Enforcement.  Hopefully he will never come back to St. Louis and fill his dad's [[clownshoes|shoes]].
* [[Cunt|Phyllis Schlafly]] - Cunt does not begin to describe her. [[Giga Pudding|GIGACUNT]] might.

* Joe Buck -- His dad (Jack Buck) could run circles around him.
* [[Leprechaun|Bob Costas]] -- Someone says he's 4'11" and get's pissed off when you say something about it.

== Cool things to come out of St. Louis ==
* [[Meth]]
* Strippers on the East Side (Can't have them in Missouri anymore due to some [[Kansas City]] faggot named [[Matt Bartle]].)
* Vincent Price
* Chuck Berry --That's right. He's on this list. He's earned it.
* [[baseball|St. Louis Cardinals]]  (The only franchise that can post a winning record)
* BBQ
*Fighter Jets, thanks to being world HQ for McDonald Douglas Aircraft until it merged with Boeing Defense. It is still the largest producer of high tech war machines meant to kill [[Arab|Jawas]]
* Fred Teutenberg, Owner of [[alcohol|Fred's Cheapo Depot]]. Does a humorous segment in the morning on the radio station 1057 the point where he reads [[craigslist]] ads posted by [[sick fucks]] from the area. used to do commercials for another liquor store called dirt cheap, but since then they have replaced him with some [[furry|anthropomorphic chicken lady with big breasts]].
* Toasted Raviolis and provel cheese. if St. Louis does one thing right it's the pizza.
* KSHE 95. One of the few radio stations left that consistently plays good, or at least decent music.

== Cool Shit St. Louis Used to Have and why they are gone ==
* Classic 99 (KFUO-FM) - One of the few classical music stations left in the United States. Replaced with some [[Shit|Christian Music]] Station. (There are plans to start up a new Classical station as an [[Shit no one cares about|HD Radio Channel]], but when was the last time you saw an HD Radio at a Best Buy in St. Louis?) UPDATE: There still is hope that our city is not completely devolving into uncivilized apes! Since you won't find an HD Radio at the local big box, you can find them on [[Winamp|SHOUTCast]]! 
*Population figures [[OVER 9000|over 400,000]].  People move either to the <s>suburbs, Columbia, or Kansas City</s> The outer counties, [[white|St. Charles County]] (Ask anyone in St. Charles County if they used to live in North St. Louis County or Florissant. They'll probably say yes and explain that they left because of the "influx of [[Niggers|crime]]") and [[Meth|Jefferson County]].
* Schweig Engel - Jew and a couple of black guys had made some humorous commericals back in the day for the infamous retailer.

== Places to go, People to see ==
{{goodnews|The buses are now running again, and if your lucky you will meet plenty of [[Niggers|darkly skinned folks]] who will panhandle on the bus, at the bus stop, at the train station, even on the train.
}}
* '''The MetroLink''' can take travelers <s>to popular destinations</s> <s>nowhere</s> '''Shit places''' especially since <s>Highway 40 is under construction</s> '''rich people don't ride the train''' so it goes places like <s>Westport, Creve Couer, Ladue, St. Charles</s> '''where poor people can't walk or take the bus to find the "Jew Gold"''' because people are <s>generally kind to each other and accept people for who they are</s> '''greedy bastards who don't give a shit'''.

=== St. Louis City ===
==== Downtown St. Louis ====
You will know you are in Downtown St. Louis by the constant smell of natural gas and piss!
* '''The Gateway Arch''' - A great place to [[Fuck Yeah|celebrate]] [[America]], kiss a woman in between the legs, and--''"Hey, man! I was just let out of prison and need moneh to bah [[Booze|food]]. Can you give meh $5?"''
* '''Busch Stadium home of the St. Louis Cardinals'''--and ''"hey man could you give mah soem change. I need moneh fer mai [[diabeetus]] medication. Can you give meh soem moneh so I can get [[Booze|soemthin tah eat]]?"''
* '''<s>Kiel</s> <s>Savvis</s> Scottrade Center''' --Home of the [[Shit nobody cares about|St. Louis Blues Hockey Team]]. At 14th and Clark, there are several things here that are more hopping than this place. St. Louis City Hall, St. Louis Police Department, the Amtrak Station, The Post Office, and the 14th and Spruce Metro Transit Center, which is outdoors, meaning that while you wait for the bus, you get to stand out in the rain, snow, heat, cold, and of course the local pot smokers who blow smoke in your face while panhandlers try to sell you socks and Pepsi from a dufflebag. ''"[[Crack|It's for a good cause, man]]. Buy it. I have this Snicker Bar that I will sell you for $3.  Man, forget you, man. You never buy any of my shit. It's cause I'm a black man, isn't it? Man, can't a nigga..."''
* '''Laclede's Landing'''--Where white people go to get drunk at a Blues Festival in September. It used to be home to Mississippi Nights, but then some asshole thought it would be a cool idea for drivers on I-70 to go flying off the interstate into a giant video screen where some [[attractive woman]] will try to convince you to stop by the Casino Lumere for some of the [[cake]] she is eating and to gamble away your welfare check. You won't see her at all in this building as the only people there will be your chain-smoking grandma and--''"Hey, you wanna buy a watch so I can get [[booze|my car fixed]]?"''
** Eads Bridge''' -- You can walk across it. To Illinois. Or you can do one better and just kill yourself on it.
* '''Union Station''' No shops there anymore.  Niggers ran them out--especially the ones that make their 8 year old children sell skittles for their fatass parents at 10PM at night. ''"You betta appologize to mai daughter! Buy her candy or [[DO IT FAGGOT|I will yell rape!]] [[Sheneequa|Mmm, hmmm.]]"''
* '''Washington Avenue''' --Lofts owned by upper class cunts who [[buy a dog|own a dog]] but live on the third floor.  Mayor Slay does not like it when your black friends come, get drunk, loud, and shoot up the neighborhood. Otherwise, the club they hang out at will be forced to close and lose their liquor license...meaning they will have to go someplace else on the street to get drunk, loud, and shoot up the neighborhood. Now the niggers have decided to carjack and steal from people. Your best decision is to not make any black friends.
** '''City Museum''' --Some old building that suffers structural problems constantly because the white people can't bring their [[fat]], [[autistic]] [[13 year old boy]] to not fall through the concrete floor without making loud creaking sounds, and screaming like an idiot louder than the other spoiled rotten children who are dropped off there. 
** '''The <s>TWA</s> Edward Jones Dome''' - Home of the St. Louis Rams. We apologize.
** '''St. Louis Centre''' - A Seven Story Mall right in the heart of Downtown St. Louis on Washington Avenue, built in the 1980s...and demolished in 2010. Not even putting the Metrolink stop for the Edward Jones Dome in front of the mall could save it. Thank's for the eyesore, Vince Schoemehl. And also--''"GIVE ME YOUR FUCKIN' MONEY OR I SWEAR I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU! Thank you, now I wills go bah my some lickah, watamellonz, and fried chicken...right after I kill you for crack money." '''BANG! BANG! BANG!'''''

==== Elsewhere in the city ====
* '''Forest Park''' where there is free admission to most museums--and get your car stolen even though you were a [[NORP]] who locked your car to keep [[niggers|thieves]] out.
** '''The St. Louis Zoo''' where white people bring their rotten screaming kids to scare the animals.
** '''The St. Louis Art Museum''' where white people bring their [[angsty]] [[artfag]] friends
** '''The Missouri History Museum'''  where you can get arrested by the museum curator for refusing to surrender your family's arrowhead collection or where you found them.
** '''The St. Louis Science Center''' where white people bring their [[aspie]] friends to a place where white people bring their rotten screaming kids.  Also, the place hasn't been as great since they removed the atmospheric exhibits with a Pizza Hut/Taco Bell.
** '''The Muny''' - Where white people take their [[gay]] friends.
* '''The Missouri Botanical Garden''' - South of Forest Park near [[Spics|The Hill]] and [[Fags|South Grand]] neighborhoods.  Be sure to stop by [[Mexicans|Gringo Jones]] while you are there. Many [[weeaboos]] converge here for the Japanese Festival on Labor Day Weekend. You have been warned!
* '''Delmar Loop'''--Beware of [[hipsters]]!  And the [[Church of Scientology]] on the west end of the Loop.  Also, watch out for niggers at the Metrolink station.
** '''The Pageant'''--Where that band that you liked ten years ago, or the band that will be forgotten 10 years from now will be forgotten and only remembered by hipsters.
* '''[[Spics|The Hill]]'''
* '''[[Mexicans|Cherokee Street]]'''
* '''The Fox Theatre''' -- The Indoor Version of The Muny and the Verizon Amphitheater. Super-gay.  The city of St. Louis has a [[final solution]] to the Fox Theater that the theater doesn't like: Reopening the Keil Opera House.
* '''St. Louis Public Libraries''' --Downtown Central branch is closed for the next two years. It's the big old building at 14th and Olive...but you will probably know what building it is by white people freaking out like a closed KFC in a black neighborhood.  On the other hand, the park that is in front of the library is where the potheads are.
* '''Central West End''' -- Hospitals. Always under construction.
** '''St. Louis Cathedral Bascillica''' -- Jade colored roof. Murals on the ceilings. Church leaders who won't defrock [[pedophile]] priest, but oh they want to shut down a Polish Church for money. Of course, everyone at that church was [[Banned|excommunicated]] and will continue to be unless the Archdioses '''[[GET|gets]]''' an appology from the Polish for not surrendering their church to pay off their settlements by [[butthurt]] (litterally) [[rape]] victims.

=== St. Louis County ===
You will know you are in St. Louis County when you walk into a neighborhood, even if it is run down with criminals, and it doesn't smell like shit or look like crap!

Just a quick reminder to our colored readers: The Po-Po show no love. So tread with caution.

==== North St. Louis County ====
'''North St. Louis County''' - Heroin! Come and get your heroin! Assuming the cops don't kill you first to get it! Note that [[TOW]] calls north county's population "[[niggers|one of the most racially diverse in St. Louis County]]". 
* <s>'''Kinloch'''</s> '''North Park''' -- [[Last Thursday|Decades ago]], Kinloch used to be one of the few properous black communities. Which to white people, was a problem that needed fixing.  So crack was introduced here by the great American patriot, [[Ronald Reagan]], as a [[final solution]] to the blackness that threatened Berkley and Ferguson.  By 2000, the Kinloch Police Department wasn't even strong enough to make sure people weren't killing each other, So St. Louis County Police moved in and took over the neighborhood.  Around that time, [[Barack Obama|Charlie Dooley]] became County Executive, and like any black community assuming that "We has a brother in charge now who will make changes that will benefit the African-American community (PRAISE JEE-SUS!)", Dooley had awarded TIF money to some real estate developers who plowed down most of Kinloch in 2003 to make way for a corporate office park called North Park [[FAIL|which to this day has yet to be built]].  Most of the people from Kinloch have moved to other parts of North County, which has triggered [[cowards|white flight to St. Charles County]].
* '''Ferguson''' -- The radio is selling Ferguson as [[lie|"a hip new place"]]. Basically, Kirkwood will become like Ferguson.  They've already contributed to the destruction of the black neighborhood (Kinloch) to make way for white people to move it and for black people to live somewhere white people won't.
* '''Florissant''' -- Where most of the black people from Kinloch moved. Still white. But you can't seem to stop by St. Charles County without some white person saying "I used to live in Florissant".  Your disabled and high friends will enjoy the rightful judgement of the Florissant Police Department.  Disabled people will be accused of being drunk and be tased.  But if you are high, drunk, and abusive, the FPD will write you off as a [[NORP]].
** There is now a black person that was allegedly cited to be in the area.  However the Florissant police found out that the girl who started this hoax did it for [[attention whore|attention]].  Still, the likeliness that a baboon is in this area and will rip off your face, rape you, and give you [[AIDS]] is extremely high, so be alert.
* '''Jennings''' --Used to be like [[white|Ladue]]. But then the jungle bunnies from Floridell Hills moved in.
* '''Pine Lawn''' --Same story as Jennings. The cops ride around on golf carts.
* '''Hazelwood''' -- Home of the Bigfoot monster truck. That's just about it.  There are two UAW union halls, but no Ford Plant anymore to recruit more union members, because that's how Ford rolls when they take local money and send it to make shitty cars in Detroit.
** '''The Mills''' -- The newest shopping center in the area. Opened in 2003 in a floodplain.  By 2013, it will be like Northwest Plaza, Jamestown Mall, and the Galleria.
* <s>'''Bridgeton'''</s> '''W1W Airport Runway''' -- Much of Bridgeton has been replaced with an 8 mile LOOOOOOONG landing strip that was to be used to "boost the local economy with trade between China". Apparently, civic leaders haven't let go of that foolish assumption and are still trying to push this idea that isn't going to happen. It's not enough that we pay the Chinese through our consumption of goods at Wal-Mart. Why don't we just give up this town for in exchange for beads and SARS laced blankets? It worked so well for the Indians, amirite?
** '''<s>Riverport</s> <s>UMB Bank</s> [[Verizon]] Amphitheater''' --Across the street from a landfill. Where Pointfest is held twice a year. Mosquitoes will eat you like a whore's pussy. It's not all bad though. Pidgeons took a shit on Kings of Leon and cancelled the concert after three songs. However [[retards|their fans]] were not thankful for sparing them 90 minutes of a guy singing like a mumbling aspie and demanded they come back because they are fucking stupid.
* '''St. Ann''' --Once a proud center of commerce, not even sunlight can make this part of town not look gloomy and rundown.  It was once home to Northwest Plaza. Then about 15 years ago a [[Wal-mart]] was constructed. Niggers moved in. A woman was kidnapped (later found murdered). [[Spics]] moved in to that part of town to set up their business of selling broken shit. The once mighty shopping center closed down, to which Wal-mart announced [[MISSION ACCOMPLISHED]].  Now that their TIF tax credits are about to expire with St. Ann, Wallyworld is trying to move to one of the nearby communities to repeat their [[teabagging|carpetbagging]] without paying taxes for the next decade.
* '''Charlack''' a municipality of north county where the mayor decided to be a complete Jew and put speed cameras on I-170 so if you go slightly over the speed limit you get a ticket in the mail. the most [[bullshit]] part about it is, regardless of who was driving the car, the owner always has to pay the ticket. but hey, it's for [[money|public safety]], right? [[lie|we didn't put these there because we wanted revenue or anything like that, we just want to prevent accidents! Honest!]]
* '''Bellefontaine Neighbors''' Another place that many [[Coward | white people]] who live in St. Charles or South and West County will say they used to live. Like Florissant only much, much worse. This is basically what Florissant will most likely be like in the next 5-10 years.

====West St. Louis County====
'''West St. Louis County''' is the Most Affluent of the St. Louis Counties, and most easily butthurt.
* '''Town and Country''' --If you buy a house here and bitch about why there are so many deer in the neighborhood, then why the fuck did you move out here in the first place?  The problem was so bad, city council members voted on whether or not bowhunnters could hunt deer in the rich suburb.  But as usually, Buffy didn't want some middle class deer hunter from Hazelwood killing Bambi. Because the dear ratio was 25 deer per 1 dipshit, T&C authorized the hunt.  So to all you rich cunts who caught [[swine flu]] on your trip to Mexico in 2009 instead of catching Deer Flu in 2007 on ward, you can thank the Hazelwood Hunters for saving (if not relatively) your life.  Also for some reason, T&C has the only known INDOOR Metro Transit Center. There's just one problem with it: NO BODY FUCKING USES IT!  There are people in Berkeley, North St. Louis, and Downtown who are freezing their asses off just to catch the bus, and the only indoor transit center is in the most affluent part of town. So fuck those fuckers!
* '''Maryland Heights''' -- West County's bitch, primarily because it touches North County. (That makes them unclean like [[Jews|Olivette]] and [[Azns|Overland]]!) Once a thriving business center complete with a Gold Skyscraper and small shopping center for all the 1980s people to hang out, the mall is now empty, the office parks are mostly vacant, and the majority of the commerce that goes on in that area is at a Casino build in a floodplain on the West Side of town. The [[Rich cunts|surrounding communities]] build a freeway through the much beloved Creve Couer Lake Park. Now, they are trying to build a [[Wal-mart]] next to the park.
* '''Creve Couer''' -- French for "Broken Heart" which is what you will have after visiting it. Creve Couer is where the Jews in Overland moved when the Asians kicked them out. Interesting enough, Creve Couer is also home to the world headquarters of [[Monsanto]] where they make all sorts of poisons that kill people. Of course, they're down with that. It's not the first time [[Adolf Hitler|someone]] tried [[Holocaust|killing them with a deadly gas]].
* '''Des Peres''' -- More like DISPAIR! Revamped the mall out there. The only time you should go there is during the St. Louis book fair in early May. Also, the intersection is completely fucked up going southbound on I-270 to get to Manchester. It was intentionally designed to keep people from North County from visiting and finding the [[Jewgold]].
* '''Kirkwood''' -- Home of the '''The Magic House''' and the Imo's that kidnapper/sex-offender Michael J. Devlin worked at when he wasn't raping little boys. It's also home to a few other sick fucks, like a couple of men who kidnapped a disabled teenage girl and used her as a sex slave AND PUBLISHED THE PHOTOS OF THE GIRL IN A BSDM MAGAZINE!  But like Florissant, Nothing bad every happens in Kirkwood.  Pay no attention to <s>the niggers that live there</s> Niggers? There's no niggers here. Pay no attention to those niggers behind the [[Walmart]] that we build in the Meecham Park neighborhood through eminent domain.  Yep. Kirkwood is white. WHITE! WHITE! WHITE! [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_City_Council_shooting Nothing bad ever happens here.]  [http://www.websterkirkwoodtimes.com/Articles-i-2007-03-30-67165.113117-Kevin_Johnson_Murder_Trial.html Our police officers are perfect!] The folks who live here are [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1578131,00.html Big Friendly Marshmallows].
* '''Webster Groves''' -- Home of [[SNCA|Webster University]].
* '''Crestwood''' -- Home of Crestwood Plaza, another dead mall.
* '''Sunset Hills''' -- Kirkwood's Bitch. The Novus Corporation cleared out much of the city for some Eminent Domain project that never happened because by the time they were done blighting the neighborhood, the corporation ran out of money. 
* '''Six Flags Over St. Louis''' -- Where niggers and rednecks go to the water park and take their annual bath. [[Some argue]] that Six Flags is shit.  Shit compared to being lucky to go there without being fucking killed just passing by the place! Many car accidents have claimed many families' lives on the stretch of I-44 outside the amusement park, generally because some Truck Driver cuts them off. It doesn't matter if you drive a small car or a big fucking conversion van. People die.  Perhaps it is a conspiracy by the Jews at Disney to make you spend $10,000 to go to California or Florida. Perhaps the roads are shit. Whatever the reason, it's not worth killing yourself to go out there. 
* '''Chesterfield''' --In 1993, much of Chesterfield was underwater due to a flooded Missouri River.  Today, overconfident honkies have reinforced the levee, and build a strip mall about two miles long anchored by a [[Wal-Mart]]. All of it [[Fail|BUILT IN A FLOODPLAIN]]. But Whitey doesn't care. It's [[Boring|pretty]]! Chesterfield used to be home of the St. Louis County Fair and Air Show.  But White People are stupid.  And decided to build their McMansion about two miles from Spirit of St. Louis Airport, a smaller air port than the oversized underused Lambert in North County. But when the Blue Angels come to fly and perform aerial tricks in a jet flying at the speed of sound, you bet some rich cunt who has just moved in to the area is going to complain and ruin something fun for everybody. Also, [[Southern Baptist|Jane Cunningham]] lives out here. It was probably her who bitched about it considering she bitched about some belly dancers who were promoting the 2010 Census. Somebody buy her a copy of Footloose and a pair of those rubber testicles everyone hangs on their truck in that area.
* '''Ballwin''' --More like BAWWWWWWWwin. 
* '''Ellisville''' --A place where people ask "Where the fuck is that?"
* '''Wildwood''' -- The newest "city" in St. Louis County, if you can call it that.  Aparently, some white people wanted to move as far away from niggers as possible, despite this, they decided to have the metro bus stop by the local [[jews|Dierbergs]] so occasionally you'll get some nigger that fell asleep on the bus wanting change to get back on. whatever their reasoning, they incorporated a large chunk of St. Louis County along the Franklin-St. Louis County boarder, much to the chargrin of the inhabitants of the people who lived there, Thus, Babbler State Park is much smaller. The city is trying to close down some of the farms in that are that have been there for over a century because some [[Retard|McMansion dweller]] is allergic to hay and the farmer won't let his son tip over their cows.  And Hidden Valley Ski Resort is just one of those nuisance properties that has been there for decades, but now Chad McMansion needs to stroke his ego. if you forget to dial 636 when you call the Imos here on your cell phone, you'll likely get a pissed off nigger that will answer the phone with "DIZ AIN IMOZ! YOU GOSSA DAHL SIS THEE SIS!!!!!!!!!!"
** '''Eureka''' -- Where everyone from Times Beach moved after they found out the dirt was contaminated with [[AIDS|Dioxin]]. As mentioned before with six flags, i-44 is a fucking nightmare going west, and if you go south on 109 to the [[meth|jefferson county]] half of it, the roads are even worse. basically eureka is the home to six flags, rednecks, and shitty roads. in other words, a complete shit hole. 
* '''Fenton/Valley Park''' -- Near the Jefferson-St. Louis County boarder, this town experiences flooding everytime it rains.  Why? Because someone (possibly white) built a town in a flood plain along the Meremac River.
*'''Manchester''' Home of the only Best Buy that sells musical instruments in the area. They're now complete with a [[Wal-Mart]]. Most likely though, you won't get to either of these places without sitting on Manchester Road for about 5 hours stuck behind some Arab driving in the middle of the road, swerving between lanes, and going 20 miles under the speed limit.

==== South St. Louis County ====
*'''South St. Louis County''' is best described as anywhere between I-44 and the Mississippi River. It's more of an obstacle put there to make it harder for St. Louisians to go to Jefferson County to get their Meth fix. Nothing to realy see here.  A new casino was built here, just south of the City-County line, and already one of it's venues has closed up.  Yet the owners of that casino wanted to build another casino in North County or North City. Fortunately, the state gaming committee has told them to go eat a dick.
** '''Grant's Farm''' once owned by former President [[Badass|Ulysses S. Grant]]. For a man who lived, got drunk, kicked the South's ass, kicked the Mexicans' asses, and became president, the chap died penniless.  The farm was bought up by the Busch Family, is home of the Budweiser [[Horse| Clydesdales]], was part of the Anheuser-Busch property until [[Dumbass|August Busch IV]] sold the company to some Brazilian who owned a Dutch beer conglomerate called InBev. The fate of the farm and the Clydesdales may be the glue factory.
** '''Jefferson Barracks National Cemitary''' - On any given day, a group of [[God Hates Fags|Westboro Baptist Church protesters]] will be there to cause heartache and anti-Lulz. Using them for target practice for you 12-gauge shotgun is currently not advised. So other trolling techniques are advised.

==== Mid St. Louis County ====
*'''Mid St. Louis County''' is basically anywhere off of I-170 south of St. Charles Rock Road. Lots of McMansion dwellers live here, and bitch about the niggers coming in from north county. 
**'''Brentwood''' Home of the Galleria, a mall that used to be great until niggers started to invade it, now it's on the verge of going out of business because shoplifting is so bad. Your car may get a little visit from the hubcap fairy, especially if you park in the garage. Brentwood itself is mostly white, but niggers from north county take the metro bus down I-170, seemingly just to steal shit from the Galleria. You'll also find [[Jews|The Shane Company]] here. 
**'''Clayton''' --where they serve subpoenas and [[Jail|balongia sandwiches]].  Also, [[Lemon Party|BishieCon]] is held here.
**'''Ladue''' This is where all the rich motherfuckers who think they're better than everybody else live. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7992/is_20100324/ai_n52968514/ The Ladue Police Department is on a mission to keep niggers out at any cost] and when you pass it on I-64, you'll notice that they have a giant concrete wall on both sides of the highway completely blocking any view of the area, almost like a fortified military base.

=== St. Charles County ===
If you live in St. Charles County and are reading this article, you are probably thinking that you're immune to this scathing article. Think again! Many of the people living in St. Charles County are gutless cowards who used to live in St. Louis County, thus there is an extra special section in this article just for you!

Naturally, it should be reiterated [[OVER 9000|how many people]] from St. Charles County are from Florissant, Hazelwood, Bridgeton and other parts of St. Louis County who now live in St. Charles County.  They still work in St. Louis County, they just don't live here any more.

Urban sprawl is epidemic in St. Charles County. They now eclipse St. Louis City and County as the Missouri's largest polluting county, and they are expanding into neighboring Warren and Lincoln Counties.  They practically have no mass transit system. They don't want to establish one. They fear more niggers will move into their county, unaware that most niggers own a big-ass Cadillac Escalade that they bought with their welfare check and can DRIVE to St. Charles County, generally to drop the dead body they have in West Alton since they know if they drop it off in Florissant, the Florissant Police and St. Louis County Police will kill them.

St. Charles County residents are the primary cause for traffic accidents on I-270 between Page Avenue and I-70.  Despite building two alternative arteries for them to go to St. Charles County on their afternoon drive, their instinct is to still drive like assholes and cut off people driving on I-270 AND to cross the double-white lines painted on the road to prevent them from doing that and weaving in and out of lanes.

Also, a shout out to the folks at the United State Army Corps of Engineers for creating a wall of dirt around St. Charles County, some of it may contain coal ash produced by the folks at Ameren UE.  If you wonder what that is and have a glass of water, YOUR DRINKING IT!

* '''St. Charles''' - Losing money because they can't get anyone to go to the Casino or the Family Arena. If only there was a light rail transit system in the next county to bring people to those things. There is, but why build something that will bring dark skinned people to our virgin white county?
* '''St. Peters''' - The only successful mall left, but it also has the largest [[Hot Topic]] in the St. Louis Area, so fail.
* '''O'Fallon''' - Tea Party. Nothing to see here.
* '''West Alton''' - Nothing out here. Just a gas station and some birds.
* '''Portage de Sioux''' - [[DESU]]!
* '''Orchard Farm''' - If anyone remembers that show on the CW a few years ago called the "Farmer Takes A Wife" or something or other, it was filmed here.  An BTW, Orchard Farm is only three miles from St. Charles, and if there was a bridge or ferry, it would have quick access to Florissant.  So yeah, that show was about as fake as that girl's boobs. 
* '''New Town''' - Yuppie scum build a new town in the wetlands. We can only hope a flood wipes out this "New Urbanism" bullshit.
* '''Cottleville''' - Undeveloped housing from the housing crisis of 2008. Why not ask your neighbors of a cup of sugar? Oh wait. They only built ONE HOUSE in your subdivision! Yours!
* '''Dardene Prairie''' - Say Hi to Lori Drew!
* '''Augusta''' - Winoes and Hipsters who saw Sideways.  So yeah, you can nuke this town from orbit.
* '''Weldon Springs''' - Why didn't they build a sound wall here to keep the sound from <s>Hwy 40</s> '''I-64''' from scaring the fish?
* '''Wentzville''' - If you moved here from Florissant some time after 1993, you are are a coward and should kill yourself. Technically this is 50 miles outside of St. Louis, but given how the next county over is being urbanized, it will become St. Louis, only without a mass transit system, so niggers will have no choice but to steal your car since you couldn't provide them a ride to work.

=== Franklin County ===
Not a whole lot to bash here. But if your producing meth, what's there to dislike?  Well, the power company, Ameren UE, for starters in Labadie. Like with St. Charles County, the folks at Ameren would like you to start your day by drinking two glasses of water...and cadmium, and lead, and coal ash, and something radioactive that you can't remember the name of it.  Here, when they dump coal power plant waste in Labadie, Portage Des Sioux, Festus, and a few other places (maybe if you're extra good, something special from the Callaway County Nuclear Power Plant near Jefferson City) into a landfil next to the Missouri River, the folks in Chesterfield, Florissant, St. Charles, and St. Louis will get a chance to taste some of that good carcenogeny goodness when the spring floods occur in March through May. "Mmm! Dis some good Cancer!"

Think this is some satire?  No. You are probably drinking it!  Of course, Ameren doesn't want you to say their name at the next town hall meeting about them and what they are doing to your health. That's a [[lolsuit]]! So wake some lawyers up and say it at the meeting! '''AMEREN UE! AMEREN UE! AMEREN UE! AMEREN UE! AMEREN UE!'''

=== Outside of the City and County ===
* '''Jefferson County''' -- If you are thinking of moving to Jefferson County, there is one important thing you should know: BROPFS HAS DOUBLEWIDES FOR $29,995! You know you want to go there. They got meth.
* '''Alton, Illinois''' --the most haunted city in America.  They also have crack dealers.  Find an MCT bus.
* <s>Club 1212/Club Legit/Club Fresh</s> ''Can't go there.  No bus service, but plenty of [[whore|ratchets]].''<sup>''[[Citation Needed|Where?]]''</sup>
* '''East St. Louis''' Across the Mississippi river in Illinois. Home to many strip clubs, [[Gambling|Casino Queen]] and ''"Hey man, can I clean yo winsheeld fo fie dallahs? I needs [[crack|some new shoos.]]"'' Driving through here at night is not recommended, because the niggers out here do not give a fuck whether you're white, black, asian or whatever; they WILL jack your car, make you give them all your possessions you have on you, and shoot you execution-style.
** '''Pop's Nightclub and Concerts''' A concert venue on the east side in Sauget, Illinois (Basically East St. Louis, same school district and all that). A fucking hell of a lot better than [[Hipsters|The Pageant]]. The gas station next door is where east side niggers go to spend their welfare checks on the [[Illinois]] Lottery.
