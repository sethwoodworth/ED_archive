'''Brett "[http://deadspin.com/5657512/did-a-jets-pr-person-act-as-liaison-between-brett-favre-and-jenn-sterger Screaming Lord Byron]" Favre''' is a true [[R. Lee Ermey|American hero]] from [[Red State|the heartland]]. This <s>40</s> 50-year-old [[Billy Mays|manly-man]] is also the starting quarterback of the [[NFL]]'s <s>Green Bay Packers</s> <s>New York Jets</s> [[Minnesota]] [[Vikings]] with numerous records and accomplishments on the gridiron over a long and storied career playing [[handegg]]. Having spent most of his stellar career as [[1337|the franchise player]] of [[white trash|Green Bay Fudge Packers]], this fan favourite was <s>unceremoniously dumped</s> retired in favour of a younger QB with less injuries. He subsequently [[disregard|unretired]] and joined the New York Jets where he sucked a big one. After retiring again at the end of a disappointing season, he came out of retirement and joined the Packers' hated rivals, the Vikings.

But all of this is [[shit nobody cares about]]. What [[you]] ''will'' care about is his career in [[sexting]]. No stranger to making bad passes, (having thrown the most [[fail|interceptions]] in NFL history -325- over a span of the most games in NFL history with interceptions thrown -189), in [[2008]] Mr. Favre threw up a wobbler of epic proportions.

==The Scandal==

Whilst sexting is primarily a fun activity for [[12-year-old boys]] and [[16-year-old girls]], it's even catching on with [[old people]]. Even your grandpa is doing it! Sometime in [[2009]], the sports site [http://deadspin.com Deadspin] broke [http://deadspin.com/5603701/brett-favre-once-sent-me-cock-shots-not-a-love-story a story] about then [[handegg|New York Jets]] QB, 50-year-old '''Brett Favre''', having letched after the Jets' totally [[I'd hit it|bangable sexy]] in-house sideline reporter, former ''[[Playboy]]'' model [[Jenn Sterger]]. After unsuccessfully trying to hit on her young, pert arse via [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmErRP2GR4M plain old boring voicemail] and [[text messages]] (he was, however, successful in [[DO NOT WANT|creeping her out]]) the 'happily' married grandfather turned to sexting, sending her numerous cockpix and a picture of himself butt nekkid (save a pair of Crocs) [[fapping]].

<center><youtube>7_D7wughWN8</youtube></center>

Whilst hilarious, the story largely went unnoticed until the decrepit old man decided to unretire (again) and signed with Minnesota Vikings. Whilst this -in and of itself- was no big deal (since [[nothing of value was lost|he totally sucked during his tenure with the Jets]]), the [[tabloids|New York Troll Department]] saw some major [[lulz]] potential when the Vikings headed East to play the Jets at home in October [[2010]]. Reviving the 'scandal' [[lulz|exactly one week before the game]] and tracking down Ms. Sterger for interviews, the NYTD sent the story fucking everywhere for Jets' fans to enjoy and use as ammo to taunt the old man who had ruined their [[fail|2008 season]]. Further [[DGT|drama-generating]] and lulz were had when Favre's pathetic unanswered voicemails and texts were made public to accompany the cockpix. After the whole shebangabang went viral the [[NFL]] had no choice but to open an investigation into grandpa Favre's unwanted [[rape|sexual harassment]] which unearthed further allegations of Favre being naughty with the Jets' in-house female masseuses. As of writing, the investigation is still ongoing -as is Mrs. Favre's [[RAGE]] about the whole (non) affair. 

===Reaction===

Favre has been largely (unlike his cawk) silent about the ongoing brouhaha but released the following statement:

{{quote|I'm not getting into that. I've got my [[fapping|hands full]] with the Jets.|Favre}}

However, [[Stephen Colbert]] had plenty to say.

==TL;DR?==

[[TL;DR]]? See the vidya below.

Additional lulz were had by the usually [[unfunny]] folks at [[SNL]] who spoofed Favre's endorsement deal with Wrangler Jeans. Wrangler has responded by [http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/18136/amid-allegations-wrangler-limits-favre-ad pulling their Favre ads] from all NFL games for the foreseeable future.

==Prelude to Favregeddon==

It appears that this whole episode did not come out of the blue. Apparently, upon joining the Jets, Favre began to [[stalk]] Ms. Sterger on her [http://www.myspace.com/jennsterger MySpace], setting up an account with the ludicrous handle of [[Screaming Lord Byron]] to hit on her assisted by a Jets' PR dude. Behold and [[ROFL|take a seat]].
