Wikipedophile
[[Image:Wikipe_tan_nude.JPG|thumb|upright|Nope, no pedophiles here at all!]]

'''Wikipedophile''' is the preferred name for the glassy-eyed zealots on [[Wikipedia]]. (etymology: a [[portmanteau]] with three letters in common from ''Wikipedia'' and ''[[pedophile]]'', total "[[sick fuck]]"). Wikipedophile remains something of an underground, "in the know" nickname for [[Bureaucratic Fuck]]s, so to score extra [[e-points]] with them, be sure to use it liberally. It can also refer to actual [[pedophiles]] who cruise for underage action on Wikipedia.

==Just how uncool their lives are==
[[image:So cool.jpg|thumb|[[lie|Clearly]] this man is swooning the ladies]]

Just like inductees in a [[cult]], the behavior of the Wikipedo aka WikiPEEdo appears so inexplicable to an outsider.
*J Di had a lovely Christmas, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pikablu0530&diff=prev&oldid=96411407 yesh].
*Wikipedos always stalk. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Chris_Croy&oldid=139990670 Chris Croy] says ''"User:Charmeyn - She'll always hold a special place in my heart for [[Almost raped|edit warring]] with me over the inclusion of an external link to a subject's personal site, then going onto her [[MySpace]] and calling me a child molester."''
*Former [[admin]] [[JzG]] says ''"If you have a [[job]] or a family, do not do get involved with controversial subjects on Wikipedia. There are people out there who are [[batshit insane]] and will genuinely try to get you [[Jacknstock|fired from your job]], [[Internet stalking|call you at home]], [[Internet tough guy|solicit burglars to raid your home]], and invite [[Pedo|predators]] to look at your kids. They might even think it's not serious, that it's only a bit of fun. [[Fortune|Only one of the above]] has not happened to me, and that one happened to someone else. [[O RLY|Yes, really]]."''

*Why do people even want to be Wikipedia administrators? Check this: ''"I am an administrator here on the Wikipedia...[i]n my time here, I have received numerous personal attacks and more than one [[Internet Court|threat of a lawsuit]]. More troublingly, I have received the occasional death threat. My [[dox|real name and photograph]] has been posted on the [[lulz|attack sites]], along with my location, though not my exact address. Recently, I have started receiving telephone calls that have their caller ID blocked. These are the typical "hang-up" calls and I am no longer answering the phone to numbers I do not already recognize. Occasionally, I get voice mails though these are always blank. I do not consider any of the death threats I have received to be at all [[serious business|serious]]. None that I am aware of were made by someone in the same country as me and I never had any reason to believe this was more significant than a teenage vandal [[butthurt|ticked off]] because I blocked him or her. And it is entirely possible (indeed, almost certain) that these telephone calls which have started in the past week are entirely coincidental. I am less happy with my real name and location, along with stolen photographs that are [[shit nobody cares about|quite possibly not fair-use]], being posted on attack sites. I'm considering [[buy a dog|changing my telephone number]]."''

==Pedophilia amongst Wikipedophiles==
[[Image:Wikipedo admission.JPG|thumb|After a long wait, someone comes forward, admitting that pedophiles are amongst them]]

Shockingly, there are those who are hard at work putting the ''pedophile'' back in Wikipedophile. As one admin puts it, "I don't think Wikipedia is pedophile-free...no site on the internet is anymore." Not surprisingly, they like to hang around articles like Pedophilia, Pederast, Child sexual abuse, and their specialty, Child grooming. They also hang out in the leet IRC channels on [[Freenode]], engaging in "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/IRC/Workshop&diff=180590865&oldid=180582701 sexual talk with underage people]."

===General conduct===
Here's an example of an argument on the Child grooming article. User Rookiee argues that child grooming is just "the general practice of raising a child." User Willmcw disagrees, and says child grooming is actually the "felonious cultivation of children for sexual purposes." Seems like a problem of semantics, Willmcw using the common definition, and Rookiee trying to take the literal definition. And since this kind of thing is a quite common complaint on Wikipedia, the tried and tested method is to resolve it with a giant flamewar. Wikipedians suffer from the condition [[ETD|Persistent Argumentative State]].

The discussion ends with this:
''Not everyone who sexually abuses a child is a pedophile. But child grooming is a much more involved, premeditated effort than simply molesting a kid. It means actively cultivating a relationship for the ultimate purpose of sex. Who but a pedophile would do so? -Willmcw 00:10, 4 November 2005 (UTC)''
:''"But child grooming is a much more involved" — Aaaannnd you would know this, how? ;) The way you're making it sound, either you've done it, or you've had it done to you. Either way is original research. --[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rookiee Rookiee] 15:43, 4 November 2005 (UTC)''

Oh, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rookiee Rookiee] had this on his userpage (before it was balleted):
:''"I'm only an activist in the Childlove Community. I am a pedosexual and boylover. I host a [[podcast]] titled Pedologues which aims to objectively look at the issue..."''

Surprisingly, he has since been banned.

===Pedophiles and proud of it===

</div>

Wikipedia has these things called "[[userboxes]]" you can put on your user page to show everyone how biased you are and find like-minded people to vote down things you don't like and generally harass other people. One new user, [[User:Joeyramoney|Joeyramoney]] (who it turns out is a [[moron]]), thought it would be funny to make a "[[anontalk.com|This user self-identifies as a pedophile]]" userbox and put it on his user page for the [[lulz]]. 

There was much lulz as a mega-bureaucrat fuckfest ensued. Someone [[Ban|banned]] the guy for [[trolling]] and also for being a pedophile. Some of the other administrators thought this was unacceptable and [[discrimination]] against people who <s>have a compulsive drive to rape children</s> [[Childlove|love children romantically]], and banned that administrator. Then they banned each other for a while until [[Jimbo Wales]] stepped in and just banned everyone for a while.

After things calmed down, there was a [[flame wars|civilized discussion]] over whether pedophiles could edit Wikipedia in the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pedophilia userbox wheel war|PUWW]]. The [[Internet court]] of Wikipedia set down various rulings. The first of which was that "Administrators are trusted community members" (Passed 13-0) and, the last, "Jimbo as the ultimate authority" (Passed 13-0). Amongst those was a ruling that "Wikipedia is open to all," which means "Pedophiles are allowed to edit Wikipedia." It also passed 13-0.

====Court battle====
Administrator [[Wikipedia:User:Freakofnurture|Freakofnurture]] raised a good point in the evidence section when he pointed out that, on his userpage, he had added that, because of the car he drives, he was "either a pedophile or a mechanic," ([[lol]]!) and that [[noone]] seemed to mind. He wondered if the pedophiles on Wikipedia that he knows would also be banned. Of course, he also felt that it was necessary to point out that 
:''"From time to time, I have admitted via a public IRC channel, to having had sexual intercourse with teenage girls below the age of consent established for the jurisdictions in which the aforementioned incidents of sexual intercourse was stated to have occured,"''

Freakofnurture pointed to users such as [[Wikipedia:User:Silent War|Silent War]], who writes on his userpage:
:''"And, as any who know me by this alias know, I am a pedophile, mainly a girllover. However, I have never, and never will, abuse a child or break any laws surrounding intimacy with children."''

Phew! The children are safe!

Also, [[Wikipedia:User:LuxOfTKGL|LuxOfTKGL]] writes on his user page, in the third person:
:''"Lux is male, and is a girl orientated, non-exclusive pedophile. This means that he is attracted (both sexually and otherwise) to both adult and non-adult females.''
:''His primary attraction is pre-pubescent females.''
:''He is the administrator of a Web community (called tkGL), which is a support/debate/chat forum for girl orientated pedophiles, whether they are exclusive or non-exclusive."''

Lux adds: "I live as a GOD worshiping, child-lover, Blessed as long as I long as I put him first. But I put children second."

You can guess what articles these users edit the most.

===Academic child porn===
[[Wikipedo|Wikipedia]]'s [[Lolicon]] [[Wikipedia:Lolicon|article]] contains an eroticized picture of a [[Cracky-chan|child]] and links to [[4chan|imageboards intended for the distribution of child pornography]]. Under the guise of having a [[Faux News|"fair and balanced"]] [[NPOV]] article, the pedophilia and incest articles are written from a proponent's standpoint.

[[Wikipedo|Wikipedia]]'s controversial [[Virgin Killer]] article [[Wikipedia:Virgin Killer|contains]] a nude photo of a child!

===The only good articles===
Wikipedia's articles on erotic topics have actually received praise from certain professors. It's all thanks to the experts on porn over there. Foxnews keeps on reporting regularly on wikipedia porn, they renamed wikipedia as THE EXCLUSIVE HOME FOR PEDOPHILES AKA THE LOWLY DIRTY WIKIPEDOS![http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/06/25/exclusive-pedophiles-find-home-on-wikipedia/] Neocons like Jana Winter do not like their articles on wikipedia so they lashed back at Jewbo & his slaves.

==Wikigroaning for pedophiles==
There is a variation on [[Wikigroaning]] to see the massive infestation of [[sick fucks]] on Wikipedia.  Here are a few examples:
*[[Wikipedia:Child|Child]]: 63,372 Bytes, <s>[[Wikipedia:Child love|Child Love]]: 162,702 Bytes</s>
*[[Wikipedia:Dating|Dating]]: 28,727 Bytes, [[Wikipedia:Rape|Rape]]: 160,930 Bytes 
*[[Wikipedia:Goodwill Industries|Goodwill (charity)]]: 28,912 Bytes, [[Wikipedia:NAMBLA|NAMBLA]] 90,164 Bytes
*[[Wikipedia:Foreplay|Foreplay]]: 53,038 Bytes, [[Wikipedia:BDSM|BDSM]]: 230,865 Bytes

Notes:
#Half of the anti-pedophile activism page is a "criticism page", whereas the "child love" page has a "criticism page" and it also has a few sections that the anti-pedophile page is missing such as: "History", "Ethics proposed", "Terminology and Symbols", and "Strategies for Promoting Acceptance"
#Wikipedia also has articles: "Types of Rape","Rape by Sex","Spousal Rape","Statutory Rape","Prison Rape", "War Rape","Rape Culture","Serial Rape","Systematic Rape",& "Rape Fantasy"
#[[WTF]] is wrong with these people?

==Rick K.==
'''Rick K.''' is a flaming homo who banned fucking everyone and called it vandalism. In real life he is a 45 year-old failure who lives in his mom's basement and spends his days fapping to [[boochan]]'s hairy man boobs. The correlation between Rick K.'s adminship and the promotion of pedophilia has long been established.
<blockquote>"''I think that pedophilia is something of a niche, and I'd like to remain part of that.''" -RickK</blockquote>
Beyond contempt.

==Massive pedophile crackdown==
In 2007 the cabal finally pretended to start banning pedophiles, resulting in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&oldid=130538721#Massive_pedophile_crackdown tons] of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales/Archive_24#Blocking_pedophile_editors_who_are_making_trouble drama] on Jimbo's talk page.  Pedophiles were [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&oldid=130538721#Arbitrary_break_8_-_wikiversity advised] that they would be much happier at [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page Wikiversity].
Led by the Anthony Hopkins-esque arbitrator [[Fred Bauder]], the purge of the pedos began in force. [[Sick fuck]] Administrators scoured the pedophile related articles and these [[sick fucks]] began to feel the iron boot of wiki-justice.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Archive29#Blocking_self-identified_pedophiles]
