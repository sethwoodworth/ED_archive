'''Daniel Cicciaro (aka: Dano)''' was from the mean streets of Miller Place, [[Long Island]], [[New York]], who ended up on the business end of a .32-caliber handgun in the summer of [[2006]] after forming a lynch mob to string up his black person friend who had supposedly threatened to e-[[rape]] another friend's [[13 year old girl|little sister]].

Dano was also a member of a 'car club' called, "The Blackout Club" -so named because they want to cleanse their predominantly [[hick|white Long Island town]] of [[nigras|the Chinese]].

==Bebo Claims Another Victim==
According to the [[old media]], this incident was precipitated by a series of threats sent by Aaron [[black|White]] through [[MySpace]] bulletins and messages where he allegedly told the [[loli]] sister of another friend he was going to stick [[cock|it]] in her [[anal|pooper]]. 
Daniel and his posse - '''The Blackout Club''' - [[b&]] Aaron White from a birthday party they were all attending. Deciding that depriving Aaron of the free chikkunz and malt liquor at the party wasn't enough, they proceeded with a bit of light hearted shenanigans as they chased Aaron back to his house. The group later was faced with a lengthy debate over who should receive Aaron's extra loot bag.

Upon arriving at Aaron's house, the group, now dressed in their Halloween [[KKK|ghost costumes]], got into an [[IRL]] [[flame war]] with Aaron's father John White. The elder White however knew that defending the [[virgin|honor]] of white wimminz is fucking [[serious business]] to [[white people]], and rolled out his crib strapped wif' his [[gun|gat]].

The ensuing confrontation has been summarized in [[IRC]] log format for your [[lazy|convenience]].

==OOPS!==
In the end it turned out that it was a big misunderstanding, and that they were all victims of yet another [[MySpace]] [[Megan Meier|hoax]]. Apparently a [[bff]] of Aaron's had [[hax]]'d his MySpace account and spammed that [[loli]]'s comment page with black person [[dongs]] and promises of [[rape|sweet sweet chocolate loving]], ostensibly [[for the lulz|doin' it for the lulz]]. Unfortunately for Daniel he had already quit [[dead|IRL 4EVER]], and black person White was subsequently charged with and convicted of second degree manslaughter.
