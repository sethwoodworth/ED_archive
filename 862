Basement Cat
{{wp80sm}}

The longtime enemy of the glorious [[Ceiling Cat]], Basement Cat is the opposite of him, the [[cat]] from the [[hell|basement]]. While being the analogy of the [[Satan]] to our [[Ceiling Cat|God]], he is not as [[e-famous]] on [[/b/]] as other cat-inspired [[meme]]s, such as [[Peter]], [[Longcat]], [[Tacgnol]] and [[That Fucking Cat]]. He '''is''' however retardedly famous on other [[internet|tubes]] as Ceiling Cat's nemesis and [[Tacgnol|Tacgnol's]] partner in ushering the [[Catnarok]].
Basement Cat is often confused with [[Tacgnol]].

Everything in existence must have an opposite. For example, [[religion]] is characterized by [[racism|positive]] and [[christianity|negative]] ideas which are unified but are ultimately contradictory forces. 
Basement Cat is said to be in every basement at once, watching your every move and waiting for the right moment to tempt you. To do what you ask? [[Masturbate]]. He's been known to use every trick in the book to tempt you to wank. Leaving sexy things out in the open, like Playboys, dildos, your [[loli|sister's]] underwear, and naked pictures of your [[your mom|mom]].

And we all known the only thing that can kill ceiling cat is basement cat and nukes.

==The prophecy of basement cat==

It is said that basement cat would someday defeat ceiling cat, and on this day basement cat shall ascend to the attic, where he shall take complete control of all that is fluffy and white. And then, he shall make all that is fluffy and white fuzzy and [[niggers|black]], thus plunging the world into the depths of the basement forever.
