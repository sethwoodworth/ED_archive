PowerPC
[[Image:PowerPC.jpg|thumb|IBM+Apple's retarded child]]
The PowerPC processor is widely regarded as the [[shit|shittiest]] processor to ever be made. Here is a list of companies that used the PowerPC processor in their products:
* [[Apple]]
** These fags used the PowerPC chips in their [[Mac]]s until [[Steve Jobs]] decided to switch to <s>[[Windows]]</s> <s>dick-flavored dildos</s> (true, but irrelevant here ''-ed'') [[Intel]].
* [[IBM]]

<s>Hey fuckwads, it's also in the Nintendo [[Wii]] and [[Gamecube]], [[Xbox 360]], and the [[PS3]]'s Cell Broadband Engine was based off it, making it the best processor [[EVAR]] according to [[your mom]].</s> We are talking about real computers here, not kids toys, you fucking retard.

The PowerPC chips did not even break the 1GHz clock speed mark until [[At least 100|at least 3 years ago]]. This is why nobody actually bought a Mac until Apple switched to Intel.
