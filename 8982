This [[Lie|highly successful]] [[meme]] that comes from [[Capcom|Konami]]'s [[Castlevania]][[Goth|: Symphony of the Night]] for the [[Sony]] [[Playstation]], a game where you play [[bishie syndrome|Alucard]] (no, not the one from [[Hellsing]]), the son of [[vampire|Dracula]], who goes through his father's [[basement|castle]] to get revenge on him for all the years he was [[rape|sexually abused]]. 

But the aforementioned meme comes from the game's opening, where you briefly play as [[Peter Chimaera#Castlevania: Wisps of Dracula|Richter Belmont]], and kick Dracula's ass using a [[BDSM|whip]], a [[Christian|cross]], [[semen|holy water]] or [[cock|knife]]. Upon entering Dracula's lair an [[yaoi|argument]] between vampire and vampire hunter begins. This conversation has some of the worst voice acting this side of [[4Kids]], as if it wasn't lulzy enough. We also learn that Dracula is an [[atheist]]. Before Dracula begins his [[DDoS|attack]], he utters the [[old meme|immortal]] line:

== A MISERABLE LITTLE PILE OF SAUCE! ==

===The videos===

<center>The original sauce, complete with hilariously bad voice acting.</center>

<center>The updated version for the [[PSP]], minus the [[lulz]]. At least Dracula's voice and lines dont fail as hard.</center>

===The text===

For those of you who are too [[lazy]] to watch the vids, here's the lulzy conversation [[tl;dr|in its entirety]]:

<blockquote>
Richter: Die [[furry|monster]]! [[GTFO|You don't belong in this world!]]<br/>
Dracula: It was not my hand that I am once again given flesh. I was called here by [[retard|humans]], who wish to pay ME [[blow job|tribute]].<br/>
Richter: Tribute? [[Scientology|You steal men's souls, and make them your slaves!]]<br/>
Dracula: Perhaps the same could be said of all [[fandom|religion]]s.<br/>
Richter: [[NO U|Your words are as empty as your soul]]! Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.<br/>
Dracula: What is a man? A miserable little pile of [[dox|secrets]]! But enough talk, have at you!
</blockquote>

PSP Version:

<blockquote>
<br>Richter: Dracula. [[DO IT FAGGOT|Die now,]] [[GTFO|and leave this world! You'll never belong here!]]
<br>Dracula: Oh, but this world invited me. Your own [[retard|kind]] called me forth with [[buttsecks|praise]] and [[Goatse|tribute]]
<br>Richter: Tribute? You're a Jew. [[Religion|You steal men's souls, their freedom....]]
<br>Dracula: Freedom is always sacrificed to faith, good hunter. Or are you truly here by choice?
<br>Richter: All I'm here for is you. [[Fuck you|To hell with your heresy!]] You're nothing but a [[Furry|blight on mankind.]]
<br>Dracula: Ha! Mankind. A [[TOW|Cesspit of hatred and lies]]. Fight for them, then, and die for their sins!
</blockquote>

== Perhaps the same could be said for all Media... ==
