'''It's a Fable''' is probably only meme that'll ever crawl out of ''[[Boring|Deep Sleep 9]]'' and live. These words were uttered by Romulan Senator  Vreenak after unraveling the mystery of the forged USB stick. As with anything ''[[Star Trek]]'', Internet users didn't realize the value of this scene until a decade later, and it became a [[YTMND]] [[meme]].
