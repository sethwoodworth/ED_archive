[[Spyware]] is the crap that comes bundled with software (or installs when you visit [[Porn|certain]] websites without [[retard|knowing what the fuck]]) that [[ohbutyouwillpet|website operators]] use to collect data about you that they then somehow turn in to money. Often spyware is buggy, uses a lot of RAM, redirects your home page to [[pr0n]], and gives [[AIDS]] to your children. Basically, spyware makes your thousand dollar [[Porn|games]] machine into a useless [[shit|shitbox]]. Often the best solution is to turn over your computer to the local [[13 year old boys|13 year old boy]] along with $70 (pay him less and he'll get more from spyware companies to install more of the [[shit]]) or whatever the asking price is for him to install and run one of the free tools listed below.

There's another type of annoying crap called "Ad-ware". Adware is known for pissing off people with completely useless pop ups, announcing crap that only [[fucktards]] and [[retards]] are interested in, like PartyPoker or Adultfriendfinder. It is rumored that the person who invented adware and spyware is an [[Otaku]] [[Cuckold]] who lives with his mom and jerks off to furporn.

=Internet Explorer: the spyware and adware sites paradise=

Internet Explorer, the Microsoft internet navigation software, invented by Bill Gates, is the single best program to use on your computer, if your goal is to fuck it up entirely.  It is equipped with thousands of ads, and it will let trillions more enter your computer. Actually, IE makes it easier to screw up your computer; the more up-to-date your IE is, the more screwed up your computer will be. Bill Gates made a dumbass of himself introducing Windows to the public, because it has IE installed, which is why your computer freezes one trillion times per second, and why the so called [[Blue screen of death]] appears. Oh yeah, one more thing, when you type passwords and personal information on IE, it will send it to many many other people and big corporations, so in fact, IE is spyware with a very expensive disguise.

[[Image:Bonzi buddy.jpg|thumb|right|It slices, it dices, it even makes [[shit nobody cares about|Julienne fries]]! Oh, did I mention that it also saves all your passwords and sends them to big corporations?]]
== Removing spyware (for windows users) ==
Click on Start, Run, and type ''cmd'' then press enter. If that doesn't create a big black window with grey text in it, type ''command'' then press enter. When the big black window comes up, click on it and type:
 format c: /u
Believe me, this is this only way to '''completely''' remove all spyware.

For users that are not familiar with the command line interface, the free spyware removal tool [[Windows Optimizer]] is also available.

If for any weird reason that solution doesn't work, open your computer case and throw away that thing that says "HD" or "Hard Drive". Or donate it for some good trolling.
