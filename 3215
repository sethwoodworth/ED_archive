A '''Gamer''' is someone who plays games, typically to excess whilst living in his/<s>her</s> parents' [[Basement-dweller|basement]].

[[Image:typicalgamer.jpg|thumb|Typical gamer activity.]]

Gamers are [[masturbation|self-obsessed]], incompetent, [[Unwarranted self-importance|megalomaniacal]] people who, due to their inability to realize their [[sick fuck|freakish fantasies]], resort to the [[otherkin|alternate reality]] provided by various mind-numbing, pocket-emptying, IQ-draining, socio-politically insignificant games as an attempt to fulfill the need of their bloated egos and to [[Internet disease|mask the pimples, freckles, and pock-marks]] which crater their [[goth|pale, sunlight-deprived faces]], resulting in the non-existence of their social lives. If they do happen to have friends, they will be the first to say "[[Bros B4 Hoes]]" the second that friend meets up with a [[girl]].

Most gamers shop at [[GameStop]] (GAME if they're [[British|Brits]]) despite the fact that they complain about their [[butthurt]] from getting ripped off from [[poor|trading in their used games]].
For a list of games, please see [[:Category:Gaming]].

== Association ==

Currently, the term is most commonly associated with electronic games: console games, computer games, internet games, etc. However, the term is also applicable to those who are obsessed with other types of games: board games, war games, [[RPG|role-playing games]] and even, god forbid, live action role-playing games (aka [[LARP]]).

=== Association of Gamers across the World ===

In [[China]], stealing one's cybersword will [http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200503/s1334618.htm get you killed].

The majority of world's gaming population resides in [[Korea]]. Koreans regularly neglect their [http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=59697 children over games].

In America, you cannot like other games other than ''Halo'' and any other bland-as-fuck First Person Shooter, other wise you will be known as a weeaboo fag. You must also like listening to boring heavy metal, graphics that emulate all of reality and wearing things with chains and bats on them. This is due to the common fact amongst American gamers, they all want to join the military and become [[an hero|heroes]], but there's no aliens and lazer guns, and despite how much shit they can spew from their whiny mouths, they are all in fact, gigantic limpdick scared babies.

One Illinois couple was so into [[WoW]] that they decided to [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,331732,00.html have a fifth-trimester abortion] rather than [[Fact|walk to the front door where he had been dropped off in his carseat]]. While eight days worth of gold farming might be seen as [[Fail|great success and win]] among gamers, the two didn't get to enjoy it once they were carted off in the [[Party Van]]. Other gamers in their party were heard to complain about having to start the quest all over again.

== Evolution of Gamer ==

[[Image:Gaming_lifestyle_advert.jpg|thumb|right|Gaming = Death.]]

Ironically, like ''[[Pokémon]]'', once gamers have reached a certain level of competence/knowledge of [[video games]] they evolve into the next stage depending on their situation.

Should the gamer be a [http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/us/2010/03/03/dnt.blind.gamer.beats.zelda.wis reasonably] good player and turn hardcore, they will amalgamate into whats known as a [[Tourneyfag|TourneyFag]], a basement-dweller who has somehow managed to lose enough weight to leave their parents house and turn up at professional video game tournaments. They are commonly noticeable by their socially-retarded conversation skills and [[aspie]]-like BAWLing at anything they consider unbalanced or unfair in a video game, and won't stop bitching until they get their own way, or their parents pick them up to go home.

The alternative evolutionary state of a gamer is to become a [[Video Game Reviewer]], where said gamer has refused to leave their basement of dwelling, nor have they developed a decent enough skill for competition. So instead they [[Angry Video Game Nerd|post videos of themselves swearing at 20 year old NES games no one gives a fuck about any more]] in a desperate attempt to be [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|accepted by their other equally socially-retarded peers]].

[[Image:LOLHaloHaterIsButthurt.jpg|thumb|right|Gamers, [[fanboys]], and [[haters]] will do anything to prove and defend their [[fact|opinions]] to compensate for their small [[genitals]].]]

== Girl Gamer that is actually good ==

No.

The [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5if3tJjIxhz596nF_zjpcPWstHt5gD8SSC7HO2 AP] reports that—OMG spoiler!!1!11!—most parents hate video games and secretly fear that their video game playing children are [[Gay|losers]] (if only they [[:Image:Wow.jpg|knew]]).

As an exception to that shocking generalization, the AP article offers the [[Lulz|story]] of Marvin Paup, who apparently has a sugar-momma more gullible than even <s>poor</s>, dead [[KCFireplug|Gweet]]:

{{quote|Those who game with their children are likelier to be younger, single and part-time workers than those who don't, the poll showed.

Among them is [[Drug_Dealer|stay-at-home dad]] Marvin Paup, 33, of Golden Valley, Ariz., who says '''he plays 30 hours a week with his son and dozens more on his own'''.

Their current favorite is "Halo 3," a shooter game played online by thousands of players at a time. His state-of-the-art equipment includes an Xbox 360 console, surround-sound turned up "[[Aspie|really, really loud]]" and a [[ADHD|65-inch wide-screen television]], he said.

"'''That game has [[Buttsecks|bonded]] me with him," he said of his 10-year-old son Allen. [[Addiction|"It's like a whole new reality with me and him.'''"]]|[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5if3tJjIxhz596nF_zjpcPWstHt5gD8SSC7HO2 OMGWTFBBQ]}}

However you may feel about using video games to distract kids from the bad touch, at least he's not [[Owlsamantha|asking how to juggle both feeding his child and his busy clan raid schedule]].

Life of Adult Gamers

At birth the adult gamer indulges in gay activities such as:

- Going to conventions.

-Reading comic books

-Masturbating to Emma Watson

-Watching IGN

When the adult gamer hits the age of 18 he immediately goes into a college and state where a lot of fags reside ( New York, California) and tries to start his life over. Not before long He/She starts to get back into video games.

==Fail==
The new [[Girugamesh]]. He loves the Japanese gangbangs.
