==Origin== 
"X IS A FUCKING [[Pokemon|POKEMON]]" (yes you need all caps) is a failed attempt at a meme that rose and fell during the [[Goddessmine]] raid of '07. Whilst gathering information on Goddessmine, her full name was unearthed by [[anonymous]], and was found to be Julie ABRA Fischer. Once anon realized her middle name IS A FUCKING POKEMON, the shooping began.

This information became even more lulzy once anon hacked into her [[Livejournal|LJ]], her gmail account, and found her Instant Messenger name.  Her LJ password was changed to "4fuckingpokemon", and her gmail password to "afuckingpokemon". When Julie ABRA signed on to AIM while the thread was still alive, many anons IM'd her with the obligatory memes ([[desu|desu desu desu desu]]), but also informed her multiple times that she was in fact, a fucking [[Pokémon]].
