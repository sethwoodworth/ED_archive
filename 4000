Inadequacy
'''Inadequacy''' is the sad state of not being good enough. Common expressions to describe people who are inadequate include:

*waste of oxygen
*waste of space
*[[loser]]s
*[[lamer]]z
*[[furries]]

Feelings of inadequacy in an individual can lead to [[camwhore|showing off]], [[Suicide|attention-seeking]] behaviour, and expressions of [[angst]] (e.g. by writing [[crap]] [[poetry]] or [[self injury|self harming]]). Many users of the [[internets]] have feelings of inadequacy from time to time. It's usually safe to trust those feelings.

*[[Tony Blair]]
*[[Quasidan's penis]]
*[[Steve Milano]]
