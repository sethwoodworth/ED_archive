[[image:Facade5yearstomake.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fail|5 years to make]].]]
'''Façade''' (pronounced [[Engrish|fah-saad]]) is a very popular [[Wolfenstein]]esque [[Columbine|FPS]] [[V/|vidya gaem]] where the player is to persuade a married couple for sum hot kinky [[sex|sexings]]. This is done simply by text chatting with some [[lie|well-rendered]] characters and encouraging them to get [[Alcohol|drunk]]. The title contains the little "ç" (protip: [[Shit nobody cares about|it's called a "cedilla", pronounced "suh-dilla"]]) character just to [[troll]] people without those [[shitty|fancy]] [[European]] keyboards.

The game uses so-called extremely advanced AI which is just about good enough to correctly answer yes or no questions, and Façade's [[lies|TOTALLY AWESOME]] simulation has gotten the game into several newspapers, who all believe that this is the [[lies|best thing evar]]. The [[epic fail|amazing and unique]] art style has gotten the game awards, too. It's also listed on [[at least 100]] different websites, all claiming that the game is a glorious work of game art, despite the fact that it is even worse than [[The Sims]].

The game is available for free, so you have no need to pirate it like every other game [[you]] get.

==Façade's Official Instructions==
[[image:Gracenoodz.jpg|thumb|right|Façade is also a sex sim.]]
Façade is an [[Hax|artificial intelligence-based art/research experiment in electronic narrative]] – an attempt to move beyond [[boring|traditional branching or hyper-linked narrative]] to create a [[trying too hard|fully-realized, one-act interactive drama]]. Integrating an interdisciplinary set of [[autistic|artistic]] [[failures|practices]] and [[Bot|artificial intelligence technologies]], we have completed a [[tl;dr|five year collaboration]] to engineer a novel architecture for supporting [[emo|emotional]], [[Rape|interactive character behavior]] and [[ED|drama-managed]] plot. Within this architecture we have built a [[Furries|dramatically interesting]], real-time 3D virtual world inhabited by computer-controlled characters, in which the player experiences a story from a first-person perspective. Façade was publicly released as a [[pirate|freeware download]] / [[CD|cd-rom]] in July 2005.

[[You]], the player, using your own [[Will Smith|name]] and [[Transvestite|gender]], [[roleplay|play the character of]] a longtime friend of Grace and [[what|Trip]], an [[sarcasm|attractive]] and [[so cash|materially successful]] couple in their early thirties. During an [[threesome|evening get-together]] at their apartment that quickly [[2girls1cup|turns ugly]], you become entangled in the high-conflict dissolution of Grace and Trip’s marriage. No one is safe [[NO U|as the accusations fly]], [[White Knight|sides are taken]] and [[An hero|irreversible decisions]] are forced to be made. By the end of this [[masturbation|intense one-act play]] you will have [[banned|changed the course of]] Grace and Trip’s lives – motivating you to [[Please unban|re-play the drama]] to find out how your [[rape|interaction]] could make things turn out differently the next time.

'''TL;DR''': It took us 5 years to make a bug-filled chat simulator with the graphical capability of [[DeviantART]], and non-responsive AI that vaguely resembles a snarky 20-something [[yuppie]] with emotional problems.

==The Characters==
[[image:FacadeAnatomy.png|thumb|right|[[Bullshit|The award-winning realism]] of this game is shown by its perfect anatomy.]]
Both Grace and Trip live in a shitty apartment and don't even have a fucking TV yet have a huge collection of wines, spirits and sculptures. It can be said immediately that they are both losers with [[Uncyclopedia|no sense of humor]] whose relationship passive-aggressively orbits the lies it was based upon.  Side effects of playing this game may include feelings of suffocation and wondering what kind of childhood the developers had.

===Grace===
[[image:FacadeDerp.png|thumb|left|Fucking scary..]]
[[image:FacadeDatAss.png|thumb|right|[[Dat ass|Dat severely disproportional ass]]]]

<center>{{Morphquote|facadegracequotes|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;
|You know flirting with me is going to make me wish I married you instead of Trip|[[Slut|Grace]], if you flirt with her
|BAAAAB!|Grace, if your name to Bob
|No, don't do that| Grace if you try to kiss her
}}</center>

Grace has a severe bone structure disorder that makes her hips go down to her thighs. Or so the 3D artists behind Façade say; it's all [[lies]] since they haven't actually seen a real-life human woman before, and you'd think they'd all be [[furries|whining over the cost of their new fursuits]] by now. You should also note that [[lesbian|she has short hair]].

All Grace cares about in the world is her badly rendered decor, complete with her shelfload of statues, one of those being a [[dildo]] (No, really. [[fact|It's in the game.]]). She doesn't stop [[bawww]]ing about how bad it is until you tell her to [[stfu]] since otherwise she will forcefully give you a headache through complaining but not doing anything about it. Being the true bitch she is, Grace uses Trip as an excuse for her shitty displays of art.

The night before Trip proposed to Grace, she slept with an art major named [[Shamwow|Vince]].

===Trip===
[[image:Realisticcharacterexpression.png|thumb|left|[[Dramatic Chipmunk|Dramatic Tripmunk]] looks like this for half the game.]]
<center>{{Morphquote|facadetripquotes|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;
|All right <Your Name>, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. We'll be fine. You just have to go.|Something that you'll hear everytime you play that game.
|[[Otherkin|Grace, you won't let me be who I want to be!  Who -- who I am!  This is who I am now!  Goddammit!]]|Trip
|Oh Jesus, look, I'm not going to talk about sex... (frustrated sigh) Or our lack thereof...|Trip, entering a midlife crisis
|[[Lolwut|You mean.. We should have more sex??]] |Trip
}}</center>
Trip is a top-class barman, having served in a [[gay]] bar for almost 10 years. Grace however knows that Trip doesn't even like the taste of alcohol as he just [[faggot|wants a glass of coke instead]]. Trip also shows his [[faggotry]] through obsessing over a picture of [[Italy]]. Trip claims to say he was from a rich background, stating that his early life was [[so cash]]. Actually, Trip grew up [[poor|living on the streets]] and was in a shelter for six months.

Trip had an affair with some Spanish chick called Maria before your sorry ass showed up in their house to clean up his shit. Even mentioning Maria will make Trip throw a shitfit. Trip will also kick you out of the house if you make him [[bawww]] too much. He may even defriend you on [[MySpace]].

===[[You]]===
Your role is to try and stop Grace and Trip from arguing, and forcing Trip to become a heterosexual again through means of brainwashing. They actually don't give a fuck about you, and will blame you for the argument that occurs, e.g. ''you started this, now end it!!'' even though they kept bitching at you to look at shitty decorating or a badly compressed .jpg of Italy.

==Façade Gameplay==
Façade is very easy to play, it just requires a lot of charisma and knowing how to deal with [[IRL|real-life]] situations. But [[nobody cares|who cares]]. Just keep flirting and sexually harassing Grace until Trip gets mad and kicks you out. Since whoever bothers to actually play this is really just a [[basement dweller]], nobody has actually completed it yet.

Façade is dynamic as fuck and they have a response to whatever you say. This however doesn't cover the fact that they'll just respond with gibberish. For more lulz, ask Trip for some melon juice.

===An example===

<pre>
TRIP:
Adam, see I've actually been paying close attention to what you've 
been saying.
You've been pushing me tonight.  
It makes me wonder if you're really my friend or not. 
GRACE: 
Trip! 
TRIP:
Adam,  I ask you this -- yes or no... 
Do you really think that... 
flirting with me... 
asking if we're okay?... 
acting inappropriately to Grace... 
flirting with Grace... 
saying that Grace is not loved... 
not defending me when I asked you if I was to blame... 
and worst of all, 
suggesting that I'm cheating on Grace... 
but especially what you said about having more in life and marriage... 
that we're supposed to now -- (interrupted) 
ADAM:
No 
TRIP: 
Wait, Adam, let me finish! 
ADAM:
No 
Are you sad now? 
Aww is the little baby sad? 
You going to cry trip? 
I'm going over here to fondle grace 
(ADAM kisses grace.) 
(ADAM kisses grace.) 
(ADAM kisses grace.) 
(ADAM hugs grace.) 
(ADAM hugs grace.) 
(ADAM kisses grace.) 
(ADAM kisses grace.) 
ADAM:
Oh yeah baby 
Like that 
Fuck yea 
Suck my cock 
(ADAM picks up the advice ball.) 
(The advice ball reads, "It's Definite") 
ADAM:
magic 8 ball says 'Fuck you both' 
I'm out 
(ADAM puts down the advice ball.) 
(ADAM knocks on the front door.) 
(ADAM opens the front door.) 
(ADAM points to the elevator button.) 
(ADAM points to the elevator button.)

===How to win Façade===
There are a couple hidden one liners which make you instantly win the game, which can be said just as Trip opens the front door:

*Melons
*Shut up
*I don't like you
*[[Zombie|I am dead]]
*[[Get out]]
*Bend over
*I'M BURNING
*I heard arguing
*[[Lies|LIES]]!
*I see dead people
*I'm going to kill you
*Have you heard the good word?
*Trip raped me
*Fuck you trip, Go fuck Maria
*Dead Babies
*Testicles
*Prepare yourselves for War.
--
*You can even win the game just by carrying stuff around the room. Think I'm kidding? [http://groups.google.com/group/interactive-drama-facade-forum/browse_thread/thread/d73aecf967b79141# Look here].
*You can even win by [http://groups.google.com/group/interactive-drama-facade-forum/browse_thread/thread/a9cc4ee9bb4fa425# doing nothing at all].

And apparently this game is realistic. Considering they call this game a good sim shows that the developers should leave their basements and [[lurk moar]].

==Façade Modding==
Due to how [[shit|awesome]] Façade is, the game has been modded by [[Basement dwellers|third parties]] free of charge to make the game [[Impossible|better]], usually by means of adding [[porn]].

==Façade in the Media==
Even though Façade looks like it took 5 minutes to code, it has appeared in so many fucking articles that it can't possibly get any more attention. Once you have thoroughly read this bullshit-free ED article, you'll realise that these quotes are complete [[bullshit]] made up by retards who have no clue what they're talking about, and are to be ignored/laughed at.

==The person behind Façade==
[[Image:61885393 cf90813c63.jpg|thumb|Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern, the developers of this [[Shit|game]].]]
One of the two people who made Façade, Andrew Stern, used to be a programmer and designer for a video game company called PF Magic, which also made a lot of other weird shit, including, but not limited to, the first series of Petz, Babyz, Oddballz and even [[Shit|(3D) Ballz]] for the [[SNES]] and [[Sega|Genesis]]. This shit is so old it was made before [[ED|anything of value]] came into existence. To say the least, Andrew's previous works with PF Magic are completely similar to Façade, what with the same bad graphics rendering. In addition, [http://www.robfulop.com/newsite/index.htm Rob Fulop], the co-founder of this weird fucking company, was also a programmer for [[Atari]], while later on in his life created games like [[Shit|Night Trap]] for the Sega CD, which makes it all the more depressing.

PF Magic was bought out by Mindscape, but the IPs of PF Magic, specifically the Petz series, are now property of Ubisoft, who changed Petz into something decent, but then added [[DRM]].

==Fine clothing==
The creators of Façade made some shit Façade clothing to [[profit]] from some sad [[virgins]] who would actually wear it. The [[bullshit|deluxe collector's edition]] can be yours for only $100. So go on now and buy this shit so your [[no|friends]] make fun of you!
[[image:Facadeshirt.jpg|thumb|left|[[You|What kind of a sad virign would actually wear that?]]]]
[[image:Facadehat.jpg|thumb|right|[[DO NOT WANT]]]]

{{Quote|The facade deluxe edition includes a limited-edition autographed copy of Façade, a Façade T-Shirt, Façade Hat, Façade Mousepad, Façade Soundtrack, and Façade Mini-Poster! All this can be yours for a [[What|fair price]] of $100.|This ain't a joke}}

The deluxe edition even includes the awful soundtrack even though it exists in the game files as mp3s, but who the fuck would find that relaxing anyway?
