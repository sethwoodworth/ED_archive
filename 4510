Katy Perry

[[Image:Katy-perry-05260901.jpg|thumb|Shes a [[Christfag]], guyse! Fap away!]]
'''Katy Perry''' (aka ''Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson''), who, according to a recent Proactiv commercial, has "feisty girl-power charisma" is another member of the long line of large-breasted whores showing up in the popular music industry in the late [[2000]]s. Katy Perry was born in the sister-screwing, scum scorn, cesspit, shit stain that is [[California]], USA. She is a middle child, and both her parents are burnout hippie [[Christian|Pastors]], explaining her [[Attention Whore|attention-whoreish]],  [[Faggot|bi-curious]] demeanor.   

Katy Perry is a deceptive bitch, who is actually a natural blonde, and dyes her hair and eyebrows <strike>black</strike> <font color="blue">'''BLUE'''</font> to appeal to [[Scene|Scene whores]].

==Her [[No|Career]]==

Katy's [[Christfag]] parents incorporated her into their Church from an early age, and at the [[Loli|age of nine]] started singing. She was influenced by the hideous, ear bashing, black person raped genre of music called [[Black Metal|Gospel]], a form of music almost exclusively reserved for Churches, owing to its shitness. She sung at her Church until the age of sixteen, during which time she was taught to dance in various styles. 

Katy Perry admitted that she is just a [[copypasta]] version of her sister, stating that ''"I was copycatting my sister and everything she did"'', doing so by stealing her sisters audio tapes and singing along to them. Katy was a jealous whore and incredibly attention seeking, and therefore had to compete with her sister at everything. Being an A-PLUS bitch, she convinced her parents to enroll her in singing lessons, as her sister was also taking them at the time. 

===Her First Album===

At fifteen some [[rednecks]] from Nashville stole her from her church and took her to Nashville to teach [[Engrish|her how to write]]. She learned to play the guitar and was signed to [[fail]] Christian record label, Red Hill. She recorded and released her first self-titled album at 15, which, being a Christian album, sucked, and [[Justice|rightly so]], failed hard. 

Katy then signed to another shit label, and didn't do anything except change her name from Katy Hudson to Katy Perry. It is assumed that during this period she jumped onto every famous cock she could sniff out in order to get signed to Columbia Records. Columbia Records are a smart group of people, and know exactly where a whore's place [[Kitchen|is]], therefore, they refused to give Katy any creative control over the work she did with them, and forced her to sing on a later shelved album.

Columbia didn't have a project going for her, so Katy started recording her own. Proving that trolls can have jobs, they dropped her from their label when her album was 80% complete. However, in a supreme form of [[irony]], Katy was found by the record label [[You|Virgin]], and signed.


===Her Songs===

*I Kissed a Girl- Written by one of her fellow executives for shock value in order to score a hit.
*Hot N Cold- A song about how guys only like her for her "rockin" bod but they quit it after they listen to [[shit|her music]].
*Ur so Gay- [[You|You]] being gay.
*Thinking of You- About how she throws up thinking of [[you|you]].
*California Gurls- A failure attempt at making a hit memorable song that will be on beach resort commercials [[unrealistic expectations|30 years from now]].
*Teenage Dream- About how she wants all of the teenage dicks in America to jack off to her. [[sarcasm|That's totally not a pedobear moment at all]].
*L.F.N (Last Friday Night)- Sings about how she's produced yet another epic fail.
*Firework- A song made only for commercial play.
*Circle the Drain<- Do I need to say anything?
*Peacock- About how much she wants to pee on someone's cock.
*E.T- About how much she wants to bang [[sick fuck|E.T, Piccolo, and just aliens in general]].
*Not Like the Movies- Final attempt to shock everybody with her "talent" on the piano and lyrics but in the end fails miserably.

===Shit hits the fan and everyone gets sprayed===

The Virgin group seem to have an unspoken rule of success. If you want to make money in everything from Airlines to Music, Mobile Phones to Interwebs, you must use sluts in all your PR. Just look at Virgin Airlines, in particular, [[Australia|Virgin Blue]]. They only hire attractive, slim, slutty women as [[Airplane|Flight Attendants]]. [[Virgin Records]] is no different. They understood that Katy Perry had a certain girl-next-door slutty appeal, and they knew the [[16 year old girl|16 year old girls]] would lap it up like steamy, sickly sweet semen shot down their throats by a [[Diabetes|diabetic]]. 

Virgin started recording her, and released a video to her song ''Ur So Gay''. The song firmly planted her amongst the [[Fa/|wannabe hipsters]] of the internet as an up and coming talent. ''Ur So Gay'' went viral on [[Myspace]], adorning the profile of scene whores everywhere who were dating a [[Chris-Chan|secretly homosexual]] boy and could relate. Soon after she released her "debut" ''One of the Boys''. The album was filled to the [[Jizztini|brim]] with sickly sweet songs about psuedo-[[whore|bisexuality]] and other bullshit. Naturally, it was a huge success, making Katy, Virgin and everyone else affliliated way too much money because Jew fathers and their rich Jew daughters have all worlds cash.

===She Didn't Kiss a Girl===

[[Image:Scarlett-johansson.jpg|thumb|right|The object of Katy's obsession.  She has good taste in starlets with herpes.]]
[[Image:katykesha.jpeg|thumb|right| Katy about to score some [[Ke$ha]].]]
Her biggest hit off the album ''One of the Boys'' was undoubtably the track ''I Kissed A Girl''. For anyone lucky enough to have not heard this shit, its a terrible candy-ass sweet dance track about kissing a member of the same sex and not having repulsive feelings. Katy was quoted saying this as the influence of the song:

{{quote|I opened up a magazine and I saw a picture of Scarlett Johannson. I said to [my boyfriend at the time], 'I'm not going to lie. If Scarlett Johansson [[slut|walked into the room and wanted to make out with me, I would make out with her]]. I hope you're okay with that.'|Katy on ''I Kissed A Girl''}}

'''LO AND BEHOLD!''' This was all [[bullshit]]. Read on for an explaination.

''Original Article [[Shock_Site/Discharges#o.2Fkag_.5Bkissed_a_girl.5D|Discharges]]''

'''Description''' : The video shows two young [[sluts|women]] making out. [Not sure who they are, though.] Only distressing if you're a [[retard|religious fundamentalist]] (or from the Southern US).

KAG is an acronym for Kissed A Girl, as in the title of the song on this page. Jill Sobule's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Sobule_%28album%29 historical song] was the subject of some controversy when it came out in 1995 and was banned from many radio stations in - you guessed it - the Southern US. 

In June 2008, young pop star Katy Perry put out [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Kissed_a_Girl_%28Katy_Perry_song%29an abomination of a song] with the same name and theme. The song made it to the #1 spot on both Canadian and US Hot 100 charts. The music video also hit the #1 spot on MTV's TRL chart.

Unlike Jill Sobule, Perry is certainly not a lesbian, and her song is only [[bullshit|edgy]] in that it slightly pushes the bar as to what is considered "acceptable fare" in mainstream pop culture. However, in the post-Ellen DeGeneres era - one where shows like HBO's ''The L Word'' are popular among individuals of varying sexual orientations, a girl singing about kissing another girl does little more than show that the population digs straight girls acting gay for their own self-aggrandization. 

Oh, and notably, Katy Perry '''''[http://www.thenewgay.net/2008/06/katy-perry-new-gay-interview.html has never actually kissed a girl]'''''. WTF? 

The following Adapted from Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:I_Kissed_a_Girl_%28Katy_Perry_song%29#Critical_reception|critical discussion of the song]]:

''Rolling Stone'', while giving her album 2/5 stars... says the supposedly rebellious "attention-grabbing" lyrics are "a vanilla recounting of her chick-on-chick exploits" and that this "acting out" is "just to get a dude's attention."... Sal Cinquemani of ''Slant Magazine'' wrote: "[Perry's single] features a throbbing beat and an infectious, bi-curious hook but its self-satisfied, in-your-face posturing rings phony in comparison to the expertly constructed ambiguities of 'Justify My Love' or practically anything in the first decade of Ani DiFranco's catalogue; it's like a tween version of DiFranco's tortured bisexual confession 'Light of Some Kind.'" 

''Hiponline.com'' wrote that the song is "not nearly as interesting or exciting as you’d expect. It’s not even half as good as Jill Sobule’s song 'I Kissed a Girl'." ''Glitterati Gossip'' agrees Sobule's song "was ten times better, because there was actual emotional content to her lyrics.

Jill Sobule, a musician who released a song in 1995 with the same title (and is an actual [[lesbian]]), had a few words about Perry taking her title and prancing around like the spoiled attention whore she is. Lulz came through when she said in an interview:

“When Katy Perry's song came out I started getting tons of inquiries about what I thought. Some folks (and protective friends) were angry, and wondered why she took my title and made it into this kind of 'girls gone wild' thing....

As a musician I have always refrained from criticizing another artist. I was, 'Well, good for her.' It did bug me a little bit, however, when [[Twilight|she said she came up with the idea for the title in a dream]]. In truth, she wrote it with a team of professional writers and was signed by the very same guy that signed me in 1995. I have not mentioned that in interviews as I don't want to sound bitter or petty...

Okay, maybe, if I really think about it, there were a few jealous and pissed-off moments. So here goes, for the first time in an interview: [[Win|Fuck you, Katy Perry, you fucking stupid, maybe 'not good for the gays,' title-thieving, haven't heard much else, so not quite sure if you're talented, fucking little slut.

God that felt good.]]."

== Perry calls [[Lady Gaga]] [[Irony|blasphemous]]==

[[File:Katy-perry-blasphemy-tweet.jpg|thumb|left|SUP SUGAR TITS?]]
[[File:Katy Perry naked.jpg|thumb|oic]]

Katy Perry, who as we all know is a [[Christfag]] has recently grown a pair of extremely ill fitting balls and called out [[Lady Gaga]] as being anything other than perfect. In a recent tweet from the now blue haired Christian mess, Perry says the following:

{{quote|Using blasphemy as entertainment is as cheap as a comedian telling a fart joke.|Perry not realizing the hilarity of fart jokes}}

Katy Perry is a [[Whore]], but as it turns out just might be doing her part for Christianity after all. Truly though, if you have a problem with [[South Park]]-esque humor, wouldn't it stand to say you'd [[Russell Brand|not be interested in people that make a career choice out of it]]?

== Blue hair cause Blue Balls ==

[[File:Kateperryboobs.jpg|thumb|left]]

If there is one thing we hate here at [[ED]] more than a slut, it's a bitch that [[RAEG|won't put out]]. Somehow Katy seems to fill both positions quite nicely. It has recently come to light that when the blue haired starlette isn't running around pissing off the [[God|Almighty]] with her [[Faggotry|Girl Kissing]] and [[wat|Hot 'N Cold]] pop tracks, she is holding out on poor [[Russell Brand]] getting his dainty little British cock wet. 

{{quote|Describing Brand as a "prostitute", Perry said the comedy bad boy only embraced monogamy after she tamed his wild ways.|LOL PROSTITUTE}}

Katy Perry apparently held out on sex with [[Russell Brand]] when they first met, and started seeing each other. In a move that she said would "tame his wild ways", she forced him to take her on dates and spend up big on trips to Thailand before Brand could get at that sweet sweet tang. Normally this sort of behavior in a woman would be rectified in a correctional rape. But with Katy Perry being more a man than Brand will ever be, he bowed to her born-again Christian tactics.

== Tickle Me Katy ==

In late September, Katy Perry had done a song with the lovable pedophile/puppet Elmo on [[Sesame Street]], only to have it pulled from the PBS show on the 22nd because of, surprise-surprise, [[whore|her clothing was too "racy"]]. They left it online for a few days after, eventually pulling it off their official website and YouTube account when parents wouldn't shut the hell up about it. It was a poorly-written redux of one of her hit singles, "Hot N' Cold," re-made to be about dressing-up in different outfits to [[rape|have fun]] or [[rape|play tag]] or [[rape|something]]. Apparently, the Irony Gods were paying her back for making fun of the previously-mentioned tranny [[Lady GaGa|Lady Gay-Gay]], an artist known for changing an outfit every 5 minutes or else it will [[Om Nom Nom Nom|consume her]]. Nonetheless, the pulling of the video was all made possible by the letters [[Tits|"T"]] and [[Ass|"A"]], and proudly [[BAW|bitched about]] by viewers like these:

<center>
{{frame|{{morphquote|katysscomments|background-color: pink;|font-weight: bold;
|You can practically see her tits. That's some wonderful children's programming.|[[I CAME|Damn straight it is]]
|they're gonna have to rename it cleavage avenue|Ba-zing
|my kid wants milk now|Don't we all?
}}|color= pink}}
</center>

According to [[TMZ|the internet's OTHER gossip shit-rag]], all that supposedly-exposed cleavage was actually a flesh-covered mesh-top, and most people think that the general public is over-reacting. While it may be true, and some of the things these butthurt parents have been saying are [[fact|even ''worse'' things to expose their children to]], it hasn't stopped Katy Perry in the least from showing off her music video, ''with'' the support of Sesame Street no less.

It yet another blow to Katy's awesome bewbage, Katy Perry's reps had an ad promoting VH1's Divas Salute the Troops Photoshopped because her breasts looked too big.

=== Titty-Backing ===

Not a moment too soon, [[Unfunny|Jimmy "Funny" Kimmel]] has already made a sketch with the [[Jersey Shore]] cast-mutants to joke about how far down the hill [[Sesame Street]] has truly gone.
