TRON Guy
[[Image:Tronguy happy.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Spandexcellent]][[Image:From-the-internet.jpg|thumb|280px|right]]
Back in early [[2004]], when the Ebaums meme-machine was still in its infancy and [[ED]] was still just a twinkle in [[Girlvinyl]]'s eye, internet [[memes]] were spread through [[email]] and then picked up by sites such as [[Something Awful]] and [[Fark]]. This story is no different. Sometime in [[Last Thursday|2003]], a computer systems manager from [[Minnesota]] named Jay Maynard decided that all of the TRON costumes he had seen on the internet sucked. With only a year left until Penguicon 1.0, a geek [[convention]] run by [[Linux]], what was a nerd to do?  Jay's solution was to scour [[eBay]] for plastic body armor and a spandex [[not gay|unitard]] and then make a [[website]] documenting his progress while making the suit. Some [[nerds]] found said website and emailed it to all their friends, who emailed it to all their friends and eventually it popped up on [[slashdot]].  Seeing as [[fat]] guy with a mustache in spandex with a [[cameltoe]] was [[Lulz|lulzy]] shit, it became the [[SA]] [http://www.somethingawful.com/d/awful-links/awful-link-2109.php Awful link of the day], and from there the old guy in the leotard began polluting our [[internets]] and the '''TRON Guy''' was [[ruining the internet|born]].

==The Discovery of TRON Guy==

[[Some argue]] that TRON Guy would not have been as note worthy had he decided to wear underwear underneath his costume that fateful day in [[2004]] that he won "Best Worksmanship in a costume" at Penguicon 1.0. After [http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/18/1515201 the original article] on Slashdot.org, the troll forums started buzzing about this fat guy in a spandex TRON suit with his nuts hanging out. Those who were lucky enough to have actually see him at Penguicon said that he wore the suit not only for the first day, which held the costume judging, but for all 3 days straight, and was avoided completely by those who did not wish to see his balls.

==Jimmy Kimmel==
Because Jimmy Kimmel loves [[IDIFTL|making fun]] of those with social disorders, he invited TRON Guy to go on his show for about a dozen appearances between May and December of [[2004]]. 5 of those appearances were Jimmy Kimmel sending TRON Guy out on dates with real live [[women]], as opposed to the [[Animaniacs|Dot Warner]] plushie and the 6 ft Ox he had been [[Yiff|yiffing]] with at home (See next section). At the time of the first date, TRON Guy was an [[obvious|admitted]] virgin. Despite Jimmy's [[fail|best efforts]] they were to no avail and TRON Guy remains a perma-virgin - [http://www.tronguy.net/videos/ here are all of the clips].

==TRON Guy Loev [[Furries]]?==

[[Image:Tronguyandfurryfox.jpg|thumb|left]]

Tron Guy admittedly resides with his [[furry]] [[boyfriend|companion]] Paul Neubauer, who's [[fursona]] is "[http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Orvan_Ox Orvan Ox]", a semi-famous furry known for handing out bulk boxes of [[furshampoo]] at Furry conventions. They met online on an ''[[Animaniacs]]'' discussion board. Once TRON Guy figured out that there was someone in this world who would actually [[buttsecks|sleep]] with him, TRON Guy dropped his whole [[no life|life]] and moved from his home town of Huston [[Texas]] to Orvan Ox's hometown of Fairmont [[Minnesota]]. Today TRON Guy and Orvan Ox own a [[house|home]] together, which they regularly use to [[Furpile|entertain guests]].

<br>TRON Guy is also a member of a lot of furry communities on the [[LiveJournal]]. TRON Guy says he feels a [[yiff|connection]] with [[furries]].[[Citation_Needed|He goes by the name Tonya Souther in the popular online virtual world known as]] [[SecondLife]], he is a female latex tiger fur who runs a business selling ''fine BDSM furniture''.

==TRON Guy Buys A Plane==

[[Image:Tronguyplane.png|thumb|Apparently they wore boating shoes in ''TRON''.]]

[[Image:Tronguy plane 2.png|thumb|left|Getting ripped off.]]

As a second choice to a light cycle, in June of 2008, TRON Guy purchased a [[unlimited disposable income|$140,000]] AMD-Zodiac custom single passenger sport airplane, despite never having made more than a couple of hundred dollars off of his TRON Guy appearances. The plane was custom painted to match TRON Guy's [[tard|unitard]] and helmet.

{{quote|"I wanted a design that would leave no doubt in anyone's mind that it was TRON Guy's airplane. I wanted the plane to be tasteful and not too out there,"|TRON Guy - Failing miserably at what he wanted.}}

==The TRON Guy Today==

===[[Net Neutrality]]===

[[Image:Put shoe on head chicken.jpg|thumb|No, I said "[[put shoe on head]]", not "Cover eye and scratch your ass".]]

[[Image:Anonymous shuns tron guy.jpg|thumb|right|TRON Guy after he was shunned by [[Anonymous]] for being too nerdy for the worlds largest nerd club.]]

[[Image:Tron and anon.jpg|thumb|right|TRON Guy and [[Anon]]]]

TRON Guy has made one of his missions in life to be the fight for [[Net Neutrality]]. Alongside [[cosplay|Leslie Hall]], that queen who prances around in the [[Peter Pan]] costume on [[MySpace]], and the [http://www.subservientchicken.com/ Subservient Chicken] (who by the way definitely will not [[put shoe on head]] when commanded) have put out maybe the single creepiest song/rap video thing on their website [http://wearetheweb.org/ wearetheweb.org]. This all star cast of [[internet celebrities]], along with the Back Street Boys lip sinking AZNs, the Quiznos [[hamster]] thing and the [[Dancing Baby]] from like [[Web 1.0|1995]], succeeded at showing the world that they are still clutching at attention with white knuckles, and nothing is going to stop them from pimping themselves out until even after it is too painful to watch. Evar.

===[[South Park]]===

[[Image:Tronguysouthpark5.jpg|thumb|TRON Guy getting eaten by Sneezing Panda.]]

On April 2, 2008, the [[meh|comedic geniuses]] over at ''[[South Park]]'' put out an episode called "[http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/1204/ Canada on Strike]". In that episode, Butters gets famous on the internet by singing "[[wut]] [[wut]] ([[in the butt]])", an epically gay YouTube video put out by [[Samwell]] sometime early last year. Once the [[Boy|boys]] reach [[internet celebrity]] status, they visit the Department of [[Internet money]] to try to get [[Jew gold|paid]] for their [[meme]]. Also waiting for their [[internets]] are TRON Guy, the [[Final Boss of the Internet]] [[Tay Zonday]], the world's biggest [[faggot]] [[Chris Crocker]], [[Star Wars Kid]], Sneezing Panda, [[Numa Numa]] Kid, [[Drama Prairie Dog]], [[Afro Ninja]], and a few others. The storyline is lame and the jokes aren't funny. They just do their trademark things like falling and stumbling with foam nunchucks, and [[Chris Crocker]] Yelling "Leave [[x|(Whoever the fuck he was near at the time)]] Alone!!!" a lot, but in the end, TRON Guy gets mauled by the panda so it's almost worth watching.

===TRON Guy and [[TOW]]===

Another example of TRON Guy's [[SSP|pandering]] is the fact that [[wikipedia:Jay Maynard|TRON Guy's Wikipedia article]] is being [[proposed deletion|considered]] for deletion by [[the Wikipedia Jews]] for [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Maynard&diff=prev&oldid=47407901 violating] Wikipedia's no [[auto-fellatio|auto-biographies]] and [[notability]] rules. This might succeed as being one of the worst stubs on Wikipedia by the way. Of course, TRON guy is on permanent [[Wikibreak]], not having contributed since 2007 except to update his [[wikipedia:User_talk:Jmaynard|TRON Guy's talk page]] to suggest someone add to his article the fact that he just bought [[bling bling|an airplane]].
