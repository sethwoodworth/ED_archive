'''SysOp''' is short for "Systems Operator". Way back in the [[Old|Paleolithic]] era, these [[nerd]]s ruled all that was to rule in the ancient land of [[BBS]]. They were known to be [[virgin]]s and [[Autism|lacked many social skills]], such as how to bathe and cook proper healthy meals. Fueled by their lust for power they kidnapped many small, innocent computers and forced them beyond their will to spread the SysOp's custom versions of ''Trade Wars'', ''Legend of the Red Dragon'', ''Drink and Drown'', and various other [[ASCII]]-based text games. If you became a member of one of these ancient [[BBS]], you had to live by their rules and their rules alone. Many SysOp's are known [[pedophiles]] since using a [[BBS]] was the chosen way for [[old school]] [[pedophiles]] (e.g. John Wayne Gacy, Walt Disney and Jose Conseco) to post on [[forum|bulletin boards]] and trade [[child porn]]. Luckily the [[internets]] came along and the innocent members of [[NAMBLA]] no longer have to hide in the dark. Fucking little boys is like a totally cool thing to do now that it's popular to be a [[pedophile]], if not sure ask a monk (Beware, they can rape you too). Thank [[God]], finally people realize they were born this way and it is not a lifestyle choice to [[rape]] seven year olds.

Believe it or not, their true nature never changed, nor it ever will. If your son's [[Loser|an 18 year old virgin]], you have a good reason to believe he can actually be an undercover SysOp fapping to gay porn 24/7 while you're not at home, unless you were [[smart]] enough to find out he was much sooner.

== How to deal with a SysOp ==
Attempting to cure a SysOp isn't an easy task, so here's a little advice for those brave [[nerd|human warrior]] parents who dare to do it:
*Take them out for a walk. Preferably use a leash to prevent them from [[Fag|running away like pussies]].
*Explain to them that "Friend and Company" are words. 
*Morally force them to take up a sport activity, preferably one that can broaden his possibilities of having a social life.
*When all else fails, apply a belly rub for encouragement.

If none of the above suggestions actually worked, you should [[IRS]] [[b&]] them unless Jew, wash their own cum blasted, fart blown, shat underwear, and spend shitloads of money in [[Yaoi]], doing it for the [[fap|fapping]], [[gay|gayness]] and [[lulz]].
