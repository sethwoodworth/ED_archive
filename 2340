[[Image:foreveralone_real.png|thumb|right|[[You]] too can beat the trolls by not feeding them and they'll end up [[forever alone]].]]
A phrase often used on [[webforum]]s and [[LiveJournal]] [[communities]] by [[moderator]]s and those who [[Unwarranted self-importance|think they're moderators]]. This is generally in response to someone ''"[[troll]]ing"'' their community, which usually means ''"having an opinion different than one or more of the established members"''. 
It is however also used as a [[meme]], by people who are too lazy to read the thread, automatically assume that it is a troll callout, and want to look [[FAIL|mature]].


{{quote3|'''Example:'''
:'''''Prima:''' So I was in this clothes shop the other day, and the sign said "[[Women]]swear" instead of "[[Feminazi|Wymiyeynnswear]]" so I went over to this [[16-year-old girl|16-year-old]] who worked there and totally started whining impotently at them for being employed by such a [[fascist]] institution! I feel so empowered!''
:'''''Secunda:''' Well I think you all should take your heads out of your [[ass]]es. It's just a fucking word, grow up and do something that actually makes a difference.''
:'''''Prima:''' [[OMG]] don't feed the trolls!!!''}}


In other words, ''"pretend they don't exist so we can continue to act as though our opinions are unrefuted [[fact]]"''.
This is often accompanied by an [[image macro]] to illustrate to the would-be "troll" that they have just been [[pwned]].
Even though Secunda completely pwned Prima on that one.
Caution: Even though people will tell you not to feed the trolls, this does not mean you cannot feed the [[lol]]s.
