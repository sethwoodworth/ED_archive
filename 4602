Kingdom of Loathing
{{pixplz}}

[[Image: Image_kingdom_of_loathing_1.jpg|thumb|''Kindom Of Loathing'''s State-of-the-Art graphics.]]

'''''Kingdom of Loathing''''' is a [[shit]] [[MMORPG]], appealing largely to [[goths]], [[13 year old boys]], dried-up pretentious condescending cuntbags, [[transsexuals]], [[pedophiles]] and [[your mom]]. [[Allah]] willing, the [[Pedobear|people]] responsible for this [[abortion]] will be sacrificed to [[Raptor Jesus]].
 
==The Game==
The game begins with the promising premise of [[A winner is you|An Adventurer is you!]] and proceeds to present the player with state-of-the-art graphics (pencil drawings) and epic adventures (repetitive clicking) through a vast continent (about 10 pages). The game is filled with [[at least 100|myriad]] enemies (stick men and aborted doodles) and items (different types of hats and pants). The game itself is a complete fucking catastrophe based on an imbecilic premise: what if the typical [[fantasy]] elements in typical online role playing games were replaced with something [[unfunny|wackier]]? [[OMG]]! Instead of using gold as currency, we'll use meat! If that ''doesn't'' sound like the funniest shit on earth to you, you're bound to hate the fuck out of ''Kingdom of Loathing''. It is marginally more fun to play than ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. Marginally...

==Game Mechanics==
The game uses lots of [[math]]. Lots of [[basement dweller|players]] try to work out the mechanics, but it's so complicated <s>only</s> not even the [[circlejerk|game's designers]] understand it.

==GAMER SECRETS==
Being the dictatorial assholes that they are, any site that has the following secret codes is automatically contacted and told to take the information down.  Use the words for the strange leaflet quest to receive free stats.  Examine the fireplace in the house.  Type the bolded word that matches the item on the mantle into the text box.  Also, finding a way to tell other players about these words in chat will get you banned.

A brick house = '''PLUGH'''

A bird = '''PLOVER'''

A white house = '''XYZZY'''

A ship = '''YOHO'''

==Humor==
What ''Kingdom of Loathing'' usually dishes out during the game's adventures is a bunch of cheesy "pop culture" references. Examples of many of the [[fags|enemies]] that are fought in the game are [[goth|goths]], [[furfag|furfags]], [[hippy|hippies]], noobs obsessed with ''[[Dragonball Z]]'', and [[fanboy|fanboys]] of ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' (they even make fun of the game in an adventure zone called The Penultimate Fantasy Airship, how [[stupid]] is that?). Ironically, all of these aforementioned people probably play [[the game]] [[IRL]].

==Moderation==
The chat system of the game is moderated by a set of [[fat|fatfucks]] handpicked by other fatfucks, whose lack of a sense of humor is unmatched nearly anywhere on the internet. Attempts at actual conversation are nearly always rerouted by the [[fags|mods]] to a discussion of food (unsurprisingly), [[tits]] (ironic because with the exception of the [[hambeast]] female moderators, it is unlikely most of the other mods have ever seen a tit [[irl]]), or how [[meme|Green Day is the hardest metal since diamonds]]. Attempting to discuss a ban with a moderator is usually met with [[fapping|another ban]], as nearly all of them see themselves as some kind of flawless internet god. 

==Furries==
The ''Kingdom'' used to be revered here on this page as a place where [[furries]] were reviled; this is no longer true. The chat system of the game is, as of [[last Thursday]] infested with an influx of [[furfag|cat roleplayers]], and are protected with a fiery passion by many of the [[douchebag|moderators]]. Attempting to call out a furry in chat will usually result in [[lulz|bans]]. 

==Ascension==
In order to ascend, [[you]] must become [[an hero|a winner]]. You win by defeating the boss of [[the game]], the [[goth|Naughty]] [[fangirl|Sorceress]]. What is ascension? A really [[gay|faggy]] excuse to play ''Kingdom of Loathing'' with [[old|new]] [[shit nobody cares about|challenges]]. The NS13 expansion was later added, which gave two moar quests in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts|Kingdom]]''. One of the extra quests is  "The Quest For the Holy MacGuffin", in which [[nerd|you]] click around a whole bunch of places and spend [[over 9000|a billion hours]] to get close to absolutely nothing afterwords.  The entire joke of the Holy MacGuffin quest is that the [[Loser|player]] gets ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OUT OF IT. This was [[trolling|done on purpose]].  

This is typically something that's obtained from every ''Kingdom of Loathing'' quest, but it's [[over nine thousand]] times more time wasting.

In the end, the Ascension idea doesn't even matter, because it is unlikely you will be able to tolerate playing through this [[bullshit|game]] the first time through without questioning the worth of your existence and going out to do something more productive, (like shoot up heroine and shit yourself),  or trying to cannibilize a child (more on this below).

==Radio KoL==
''Kingdom of Loathing'' stands apart from even marginally enjoyable computer games by virtue of its streaming internet radio station, [[crap|RKOL]]. There's also an alternate station called GKOL, which truly lives by the words of its motto: "We exist to give you [[shit nobody cares about|shit]]!". In between 10 song blocks of artists ranging from [[old]] [[hippy]] [[crap]] like They Might Be Giants to shitty [[emo]] such as [[My Chemical Romance]], listeners are often treated to the [[batshit]] rantings of the disc jockeys, who are all, without exception [[fat]] [[goth]] [[drama whore|drama whores]] from [[New Jersey]]. What's worse, their [[fanboys|fanboys]] listen to [[Linkin Park]] and keep fucking with this article, depriving it of precious [[lulz]] and making it as pleasing for the eye as looking at a [[goatse|goat, see]].

==Leads to Murder?==
[http://cbs13.com/national/Jamie.Rose.Bolin.2.266529.html ''Kingdom of Loathing'' is directly responsible for the cannibal murder of a 10 year old girl.] I just hope they're happy, the fuckers. In all fairness though, said little girl looked like a [[Your_mom|bitch]], and was therefore, [[asking for it]].

Be advised that the game's mods consider this a touchy subject, as they spent many a night playing jizz-on-the-biscuit with good ol' Kev, and treasure their memories fondly. Thus this knowledge can be used for extra [[Jew golds]] when trolling ''KoL'' chat. Witness the success of just thirty minutes of trolling and creating multis when [[b&]] (lines of interest asterisk'd):

==Raiding==
To create an [[emo|emo-filled]],[[lulz|lulzy]], [[drama|drama-fest]] in the ''Kingdom of Loathing'' chat community is incredibly simple. Here are some easy steps: 

1. Use [http://www.mailinator.com] to create a ''Kingdom of Loathing'' account. The best way to do this is to use a name with the word [[rape|"rape"]] in it, or to create a name that combines well with the words [[faggotry|"Mod Warning: ____ has been banned from the chat"]]. 

2. Complete the [[bullshit|literacy test]] required to enter chat. 

3. Make a reference to Kevin Ray Underwood. Make sure to bring up how fucking [[fat]] the moderators are, or how ''KoL'' meets are the best place to [[man the harpoons]]. Or feel free to insert your own variation of [[awesome]] [[win]]. Another good tactic is to subtly start in on the cat roleplayers you will likely encounter in under five minutes, as there are [[at least 100|dozens of them]] in chat at a time. Alternatively, you can send "kmail", ingame messages not connected to chat, to the players you see in the chat channel you start in, to get them BAWWWWWWWing in chat without you ever saying a word. 

4. ????? 

5. [[PROFIT]]!! 

6. Repeat
