== Why it Was Created ==
'''To be blunt:'''

<video type="youtube" id="<video type="youtube" id="kYM1uSzsl7k" width="640" height="510" frame="true" position="center"/>

[[Last Thursday|Not too long ago]], [[Moot]] decided that he was sick of the neckbeards on [[V/|/v/]] bitching about the large number of Pokemon threads occupying their board so he decided he would give the [[You|/v/irgins]] what they wanted and created a board just for [[Pokemon]]. This was generally regarded as a good decision as it cleared the [[Homosexuality|faggotry]] of Pokemon threads from /v/, so all of it's [[Fat|charming residents]] could go back to complaining that every console sucks without the disturbance of "Pokemon alt art thread, taking requests!!!!" and "Trading thread!" every ten minutes. [[LOL WUT|For some unknown reason]] Moot changed the page so it says /tr/ (Team Rocket) when clicked, resulting in /vp/'s residents calling themselves [[Gay|/tr/ainers]]. All this accomplished was slightly confusing [[you|a few people]] and giving posters on /vp/ a [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|faggy name to call themselves]].

== What it Achieved ==
[[File:Tentaquil.png|thumb|If you post on /vp/, this is your new favorite Pokemon.]] 
Apart from clearing the Pokefags off /v/ (and [[/b/]] for that matter,) it gave Pokefags a place of freedom to [[Religion|worship]] Pokemans and [[fap]] to [[Rule 34|mewtwo plugging gardevoir]] without being told to [[gtfo]]. Many had [[Unrealistic Expectations|high hopes]] for this new board but these hopes were soon crushed as /vp/ rapidly filled with [[13-year-old boy|13-year-old boys]] who couldn't wait to start discussing the release of Pokemon [[nigra|black]] and white and how they will be [[The best]] games EVAR!! Along with these new /tr/ainers came moar [[Shit nobody cares about|Pokemon alt art, trading threads, Pokemon Drawing threads, Pokemon roleplay threads]] and a shit ton of the Pokemon [[advice dog]] spinoffs (known to everyone that these are the worst and most [[unfunny]] spinoffs of all). Worse than this is that fact that two out of three threads are just /tr/ainers getting excited about the release of Pokemon black and white, they have even gone as far as declaring them the [[Unrealistic Expectations|best games ever]] despite the fact they haven't come out. The only real difference between /vp/ and Pokemon threads on /v/ and /b/ is a massive increase of 13 year old boys and a large decrease in [[fap|pokeporn]]. But above all, their greatest achievement was on 7/22/10, when the blood puking Tentaquil was born! 

[[tl;dr]] Moot created a larger and less interesting version of the Black and White release countdown clock on [[Bulbagarden|bulbapedia]] filled with underage b&.

== [[Gary Oak]] ==
While the inclusion of Gary "Motherfucking" Oak is normally a good thing, the underage faggots of /vp/ managed to misconstrue all the win that personified Gary and ruin what could have been a [[Unrealistic expectations|potentially lulzy]] addition to their board. In /v/ and /b/, Gary Oak is a cocky badass who will show up at the worst imaginable times to rub your face in the dog turd you just stepped in. Naturally, he became a frequent subject [[DESU|spammed in threads]] when the potential for lulz arose. However, Gary wasn't showing up to make fun of OP or any of the other idiots that infest this board; rather, he would make his appearance whenever a porn dump was occurring [[Waaaambulance|without the use of the spoiler button]].

That's right. /vp/ managed to turn Gary Oak into a fucking pseudo-[[white knight]] prude out to defend the innocence of the virgin eyes of those lurking worksafe boards. [[What|On 4chan]].

== Typical /vp/ users ==
[[Image:Yaoitrolling.jpg|thumb|[[Yaoi]] fangirls strike]]
*/vp/ users (or /tr/ainers) are rarely found over the age of 13.
* Most of their names are some Pokemon followed by a [[tripcode]]. 
* If insulted or something is said that they don't agree with they will call you a faggot and tell you to go back to /v/.
[[Image:Barrykun.png|thumb|[[Typical]] /vp/ post.]]

=== Trolling /vp/ ===
----


Since a majority of the board is underage b& they are easily butthurt and almost as easy to troll as the dumbshits on [[Chatroulette]].
* Tell them [[Fact|Pokemon is not real]] and they are not Pokemon trainers.
* Say that [[Fact|the best Pokemon games were red blue and yellow]]. (They will furiously call you a nostalgiafag and tell you to go back to /v/).
* Call them out for being underage b& and mention that even though it's a [[Oxymoron|worksafe board]] the mods should still ban their asses for this rule violation.
* Post pokemon or trainer [[rule 34|porn]] without using the spoiler button.
* Call them [[newfags]], you will be assaulted by them telling you it's a new board so everyone is new.
* Tell them that [[butthurt|Pokemon black and white are shit]].
* Remark that after 15 years the battle scenes are still two cardboard cutouts that don't move when they attack. 
* Start a thread about Digimon or yo-gi-oh and pretend to confuse it with Pokemon. (It is surprising how many of them actually think you don't know the difference and can't wait to show you).
* Say that [[Gardevoir]] is [[furfag]] material and wait for them to start making bullshit excuses on how their waifu is not a furry.   
* Say that Isshu is based off Shanghai and not New York.
* Say that Isshu is based off New York and not Shanghai.
* Explain why Brendan has white hair and not a white hat.
* Link them to this page.

==Cancer==

Since /vp/ has hoards of [[13 year olds|13 year old circlejerks,]] they like to make unfunny cancer that even makes [[Divide by zero|/b/ look decent.]] They will spam [[Unfunny|"LOLOLOL >IMPLYING OWLS R BIRDZ" or "Masteerrr I wet the bed again :(".]] Once in a [[Last Thursday|blue moon,]] they try to [[Epic fail|hold raids]] as terrible attempts to [[Impossible|actually make them look cool.]] The target is mostly /v/, because even though [[Moot|moot]] gave them their own board so they could [[GTFO]] and [[STFU]], they think [[Retarded|it's cute to bother them]], but recently they've started targeting [[fit|/fit/]], [[sp|/sp/]], and [[g|/g/]]. These are easily ignored and quickly dissolved, as [[Fact|all boards are smarter than /vp/]]; as soon as their attempted raid [[pwnt|backfires]], [[You|they]] quickly go back to their homage to stir up even MOAR cancer. [[Logic|There is no cure, because Moot, nor anyone on 4chan, cares about /vp/ and they will never have mods.]]

== Joana ==
[[Last Thursday]], a thread was created (It originally came from [[/b/]]) where someone claimed that their sister was hospitalized in a deep coma as a result of '''getting her hair caught in the wheels of a car in a bizarre accident'''. Apparently the girl had her own [[Pokémon]] fan character whom she named "Joana", and he then asked people to create pictures and sprites in honor of his sister's "Pokémon character" as a way to ease the '''guilt'''. Only a few people pointed him out for being the fucking piece of shit [[troll]] that he really was, and instead, anyone that did call this troll out got White Knight'd and called /b/tards. The other fucktards then began to fall for the troll's requests as onlookers facepalmed in disbelief. The thread has since then spawned a "mini-meme", where it has become copypasta. It is usually posted to trick [[newfags]] and drawfags alike into giving the poster of said copypasta whatever they wanted. It is a truly pathetic display of peasantry by making up stories of a girl falling into a coma in order to receive requests disguised in lies, but as we've all come to know, [[4chan]] will bring on the [[lulz]] in any way that it can.


The Original Copypasta:

"/vp/, I'm scared out of my fucking mind.

My sister is 12 years old and she's a huge fan of Pokemon. She liked to roleplay on some chat rooms as her own Pokemon trainer "Joana."

She got hit by a car and her hair got stuck in the wheel and the car dragged her two feet. Right now, she's in the hospital and she's currently in a coma. I'm not sure if she'll survive.

She used to describe this character with long black hair, a hat that was white and cyan and a blue dress with white skin. She loves water-type Pokemon.

I know you're all not into RPing and shit like that, but please make a sprite/art of the character, /vp/. I was never there for her because our parents left each other and now I'm crying my fucking eyes out because of the guilt.


Please, /vp/. Help me."


There has also been various spin offs of the copy pasta such as:


"/vp/, I'm scared out of my fucking mind.

My brother is 16 years old and he's a huge fan of Pokemon. He liked to hit on some women on chat rooms as his own Pokemon trainer "Joana."

He got hit by a taco and his ball sack got stuck in the wheel and the car dragged him two feet. Right now, he's in the hospital and he's currently in a coma. I'm not sure if he'll survive.

He used to describe this character with short black hair, a vest that was black and green and a orange shirt with brown skin. He loves rock-type Pokemon.

I know you're all not into RPing and shit like that, but please make a sprite/art of the character, /vp/. I was never there for him because our parents left each other and now I'm crying my fucking eyes out because of the guilt.


Please, /vp/. Help me."



== Riiarei [[DA|deviantart]] raid ==

On the morning of September 5th, 2010, some /tr/ainer posted some [[shit]] saying that this person on [[deviantart]] has [[chris-chan|SUCH SUPER DESU AND CREATIVE ORIGINAL CONTENT]], or simply known as the [[faggot|Glowchus]]. The original post contained both some general info and the deviantart link, and soon [[anonymous|anons]] jumped forth to the [[trolling]] of her profile. after the first 2 hours, [[retard|Riiarei]] got so [[butthurt]] over all the spam she decided to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|FLAG FUCKING EVERYTHING]], and at the same time epic lulz were being generated.

[[File:Epiclulz234234.JPG|The post that started it all]]

In stage 3 of the raid, Riiarei starts posing to be hacked, when she actually isn't. with that being said, [[OMG|SHE GOES FLAGGING EVERY COMMENT, EVEN HER FRIENDS COMPLIMENTING HER!!!11!!1]], just to make people believe shes hacked when shes not.

However, the shining point of this raid was when a [[tripfag]], Prof. Maple, told Riiarei that [[Rules 1 and 2|4chan was raiding her]]. He then decided to defend the fact he broke the rules on the thread, leaving someone to get [[dox]] on him. The dox revealed he was a [[13-year-old]] [[gay]] [[cosplayer]]. After this, he shut up and many lulz were to be had.
