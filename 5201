'''Marriage''' is an [[IRL meme]] designed by [[Christfag]]s to ruin your life. You get nailed to an annoying whiney [[bitch]] or [[emo]] fag for the rest of your life unless you're smart and in it for the [[Anna Nicole Smith|money]]. 

== History of Marriage ==

Marriage was created over 100 years ago by a king who was trying to get some land but was too much of a pussy to take it from people. Some people would disagree and say that marriage was and is meant as an expression of true love, but those people are usually virgins who have never gotten any, much less been married. A typical medieval marriage consisted of a king who wanted some land,  [[Impotent|but lacked the balls or ability]] [[Rape|to go out and conquer some.]] So instead he would [[Prostitution|marry off his son/daughter]] to [[Pedophile|some other ruler]] so that the new land would technically belong to both of them.

That being said, the purpose of marriage hasn't changed much over the centuries, but the practice has. A woman will often see a man with a nice house or a nice car and will attempt to trick the man into [[Trap|"loving"]] her. This ensures that the lazy bitch will own half of the man's property even though she didn't work for it. That wouldn't be so bad for the man ([[unrealistic expectations|he ''does'' get constant pussy]]) if the woman actually did something instead of sitting on her ass at home all day.  If the man tries to put the woman in [[Kitchen|her place]], she will immediately divorce him and take half of his hard earned shit.

[[TL;DR]] Marriage was created as a way to get new shit, and it is still used for this purpose today.

# You can sue your partner for profit if you can prove being cheated on.

== Theoretical Truth About Marriage ==
The necessity of marriage comes from distrust. Here are some facts.
* If you trusted your partner you would not need the protection from the government so that one can sue the other after breakup.
* You actually do not need a recognition of your relationship by some authority.

== How To Beat Your Wife ==

If your wife gets too uppity, beating her is a completely appropriate way to keep her in line. The [[terrorists|Saudis]] explain the proper way to do this:

== How to Beat Your Man ==

[[texas|(Anyway you please, he can't fight back)]]

It is generally accepted in egalitarian Western society that if a psychotic sadistic bitch-harpy sees fit to smack, stab, shoot, or pull any other [[BDSM]] shit her husband, she obviously had a damn good reason for it. Remember: If it's a woman striking a man, it's not sexism - it's [[feminism|empowerment]]!

[[shooped|Staged]] experiment, real reaction.

==Exit Plan==

In every [[boyfriend|young man's]] life, he’ll wake to find himself with his [[girlfriend]] acting in a very [[16-year-old-girl]] way.  Vaguely through the worst [[hangover]] of his life, the sketchy memory of asking his girlfriend to marry him in some drunken mad plan to get a [[sex]] is dragged screaming to the forefront of his mind.

There are many elaborate plans to get out of this situation such as [[suicide]] for example; however a simple fast and painless way to exit is to [[upload]] those [[Porn |romantic movies]] you made together to [http://www.yuvutu.com/ yuvutu].  Then over a [[romantic]] celebratory dinner explain that now you have the deepest [[love]] for each other, you have decided to [[Feminism|share]] that love with the [[Internets|whole world]] making it a [[THE_PROMISED_LAND|better place]] for your first [[wife]] to live.

==Celebrities and Marriage==

It has been seen countless times in the media. Whenever a famous actor is accused of being [[gay]], he quickly reacts and finds the most whorish woman to marry. Quickly, they "consummate" their marriage, usually out of the country. When they come back, the allegations disappear! Score!

[[Tom Cruise]] is a major offender of this.
