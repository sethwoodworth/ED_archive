ENDtheNWO
'''ENDtheNWO''' is a [[emo|waste of space]] that can be found on #politicaldebate on the AUSTnet [[IRC|IRC]] network.

He spends hours regaling people with [[sick fuck|fantasies of raping Lucy Liu]], [[pedo|fantasies of raping children]], [[fag|fantasies of having sex with his male friends]], [[an hero|fantasies of committing suicide]]. When not doing these things he regularly claims his [[drama whore|mother has just died]], acts in an [[internet tough guy|overly aggressive manner which eventually leads to a demand for a public meeting & fight]] - which he always [[lulz|backs out of]], and best of all [[quitting IRC forever|threatens to leave irc forever]]. Unfortunately he always [[fail|comes back]].

These days he now goes by the name of Existence.

[20:03] <Existence> I think LamontCranston is agitating for somebody to write one up on himself...but 
                    really, nobody is interested enough in him to even bother.
[20:03] <LamontCranston> it'd be removed END
[20:04] <Existence> LamontCranston, why would it be removed?
[20:04] <LamontCranston> ;)
[20:05] <Existence> Does that mean that you regularly give head to the site's owner?

==A typical day for ENDtheNWO==
<pre>
[15:49] <ENDtheNWO> I like degredation
[15:49] <ENDtheNWO> That's the part about porn that I get off to most
[15:49] <ENDtheNWO> In real life I'm very respectful
[15:49] <Tigger_> why is that?
[15:49] <hirum> though I like porn, I have to say porn does degrade the act of sex as bestial. And its a natural progression
[15:49] <ENDtheNWO> Tigger_, it just is so hot
[15:49] <hirum> to treat people like dirt in porn.
[15:50] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, yes including the men
[15:50] <hirum> not really the men. Unless its gay porn
[15:50] <hirum> a girl on top does not 'empower' women.
[15:50] <hirum> Society still believes any sex is male initiated. Porn is just an extension of that idea.
[15:51] <hirum> even if its produced by females
[15:51] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, but the men in porn are degraded to the level of being beasts
[15:51] <hirum> you have two seperate movements , those that cater for the couples/females which tend to be mediocre stuff.
[15:51] <hirum> and the ones that cater for guys which is going into more extremes
[15:51] <Tigger_> so the ultimate porn would have women getting bashed up?
[15:51] <hirum> like strangling (dont know the term) is quite frequent now
[15:52] <hirum> the one the INXS got involved in
[15:52] <ENDtheNWO> Tigger_, for me?
[15:52] <ENDtheNWO> INXS strangling porn?? eww
[15:52] <ENDtheNWO> Oh no you mean auto-erotic asphyxiation
[15:52] <hirum> Tigger_ pretty much it. Snuff films would be the ultimate. It hasnt gone there
[15:52] <ENDtheNWO> That's not stranging others
[15:52] <hirum> but its definietly heading towards the extreme
[15:52] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, oh yes that's right because snuff films don't exist :P
[15:52] <hirum> talking about in the mainstream industry
[15:53] <hirum> not talking about home videos 
[15:53] <ENDtheNWO> Tigger_, they already have "simulation" snuff...where cannibalism, murder, etc is filmed using high tech props, etc.
[15:53] <ENDtheNWO> Tigger_, and that's legal.
[15:53] <hirum> ENDtheNWO porn doesnt use that. Thats just movies
[15:53] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, I saw porn that did that.
[15:53] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, that was like 5 years ago
[15:53] <hirum> well you probably know more about me in that field..
[15:54] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, using some type of meat or (I'd prefer to think it wasn't meat, yuck) something else to simulate cannibalism
[15:54] <hirum> the most exreme films Ive seen was the gunea pig series in japan. Which werent porn
[15:54] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, and fake hacking people to death with half the body being under the table type stuff
[15:55] <hirum> I think the problem is with those films that try to convey erotic images with 'murder' is that the person becomes conditioned
[15:55] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, the thing that shocked me was that it was men doing it to women
[15:55] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, and this was legal mainstream
[15:55] <hirum> to think sex depends on murder for arousal.
[15:55] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, yes or desensitized.
[15:55] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, to your average person death and sex are intimately connected
[15:55] <hirum> yeah but as I said I dont know about eating people porn. I rather keep away from such films
[15:56] <hirum> gunea pig was bad enough.
[15:56] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, the IDEA of cannibalism is more arousing than watching it
[15:56] <hirum> ...
[15:56] <hirum> you really need to see a psychiatrist.
[15:57] <hirum> there is nothing about cannibalism that is 'arousing'
[15:57] <Tigger_> when did all this start?
[15:57] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, no really it works more in erotica texts than in say a video seeing blood, etc...
[15:57] <hirum> so you get aroused reading about cannablism?
[15:57] <Peregrinus> i would be more concerned with the inherent issues of eating human dna and brain disease
[15:57] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, think of how women like to fantasize about being stuck on a pole over a fire, sweating away naked about to be eaten
[15:57] <hirum> ?
[15:57] <hirum> .....
[15:57] <ENDtheNWO> hirum, yes I do
[15:57] <hirum> wtf??
[15:57] <hirum> ok
[15:57] <Tigger_> err, what?
[15:57] <hirum> i am getting creeped out seriously
[15:58] <hirum> lets end it here
</pre>
hirum speaks for all of us.
