'''William Henry "Bill" Cosby, Jr.''' (Born December 9, 1922 – Died October 11, 1991 - Myocardial infarction) was an [[Hollywood|American actor]], comedian, [[Advertising|pitchman]], and [[Philosophy|philosopher]] best known for starring in his own television sitcom, Mad TV.  He also is known for his wild and outlandish stage act where he would often slip into a [[Sparkling Wiggles|linguistically challenging]] version of his own slang.

==History==

{{quote| A word to the wise ain't necessary - it's the stupid ones that need the advice.|Young Billy Cosby}}

Cosby was born in Philadelphia and raised by his [[parents]].  [[Nothing]] spectacular occurred to Bill until he joined the [[army]] and performed the duties of a medical corpsman aboard [[Navy|naval ships]], army and marine bases, and the [[House|Bethesda naval hospital in Maryland]].  After his stint in the [[marines]], he came home and had nothing much to do, so he panhandled, performed [[Awesome|street mime]], and begged for quarters on various Philly street corners.  At some point he became a doctor of [[Fake|Education]] (not really a doctor, but humor him) and then much later on he produced, acted, and owned some television shows.  In 1991 he died of a massive heart attack at the age of 69, screaming [[HNNNNNNGGGGG|“I’M COMING TO JOIN YOU ELIZABETH…I’M COMING TO JOIN YOU!”]]

==Success==

{{quote| Civilization  had too many rules for me, so I did my best to rewrite them.|A wealthy Cosby made his own rules after years of working for “The Man.”}}

Cosby, while sporting his trademark hooded style sweatshirts, gained wild popularity and massive success during the early to mid [[1970s]] due to his over-the-top situation comedy [[The Cosby Show|“The Cosby Show”]] which detailed his troubled life with his quarrelsome [[wife]], spoiled rotten [[kids]], and his ever-snooping in-laws.  Because of this success, he also created and stared in several other television shows, most notably, [[Fat]] Albert and the Cosby Kids, A Different [[Earth|World]], [[Swearing|Kids Say the Darndest Things]], and a long running advertisement campaign for Jello Brand [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/5/55/Pudding.jpg Pudding Pops.]  Some of the companies he used to do advertising for still use his likeness in association with their brands, for example New [[Coke]].

==Around the Internet==
[[Image:Bill Cosby - 10.jpg|thumb|On the set of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids.]]
His [[success]] on [[television]] naturally progressed to success on the [[internet]].  Even though he has been dead over 15 years, Cosby and his many characters are still popular, in the form of memes, today.  Some of the more interesting things Cosby was responsible for are now popular on many sites.  For example, his wild and zany [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Special:Random RANDOM] slang is often used when a person cannot be understood.  But do not let that fool you, Cosby was a outspoken education advocate and bemoaned the African-American tendency to use "ebonics."  He often campaigned against the use of such slang and even spoke in front of the United States Senate.  The well documented case is still talked about on the internet today, often humorously inter-spliced with some of Cosby's off-beat humor and slang.

Some examples of what you might find:

* Images of Cosby on stage.  A funny quotation inserted into the photograph.
* Images of Cosby testifying in front of a Senate committee on ebonics.
* Humorous Photoshopped advertisements from his days as a salesperson for such companies as [[Apple|Texas Instruments]], Coca Cola, and [[Vomit|Golden Corral Buffets, inc]].

Upon his death due to a massive heart attack, the world was shocked and saddened by the departure of one of its brightest and most witty comedic minds.  Several notable stars and former co-stars attended the funeral, including Robert Culp, [[Ty Cobb]], LaWanda Page, [[Martin Luther King]] jr., Lena Horne, Redd Foxx, Grady Wilson, Theodore Aloysius "Theo" Huxtable, Bubba Baxter, Tempestt Bledsoe, Barack Obama, and Keshia Knight Pulliam.  During the proceedings, [[Norm MacDonald]], appearing in his Burt Reynolds costume, was asked to speak on Bill Cosby’s behalf and he gave a stirring and memorable tribute to Cosby.
