'''* People showed up in droves — all wearing masks, and all referring to themselves as “Anon.” We picketed in groups of up to 200 people, and I saw more than 500 different protesters over the course of the day.'''

::''"The protesters was the kind of people you’d expect to organize a protest online — probably around 80% young males ranging from 18 to 35 or so, and all Internet and tech savvy. This was definitely a nerdy Internet crowd, and people made constant references to LOLCats and “Caturday”; people spoke in l33t speak."''

::''"The other interesting thing was that everyone took the “rules” that Anonymous laid out very seriously. Nobody used their real names, introducing themselves as “Anon” and referring to everyone else as “Anon”''"

* '''Hollywood and Highland'''

::''"At that first location, the Scientologists had hung drapes in all of their windows, and locked up all the doors — but they did have three security cameras recording us."''

* '''The Celebrity Center'''

::''"A few Scientologists from inside the complex started taking pictures of us. One woman stepped out on a balcony and took several photos, and another guard popped out in an alleyway with a telephoto lens and photographed us as well. The Celebrity Center had dozens of security cameras hidden in the bushes around the complex, so we made sure to show them our signs. Luckily, we were all wearing our masks, so they wouldn’t be able to identify us."''

* '''L. Ron Hubbard Dianetics Center'''

::''"This complex was swarming with security guards (multiple guys positioned at every entrance and around the parking lot). There were also several Scientologist guards on bikes who kept circling around the block to spy on us, and occasionally take pictures."''

::''"We were protesting at the main entrance, so we saw everyone who entered and left. The demographic of the church looked to be entirely young, white, yuppy / Hollywood types driving really nice cars. Whenever people pulled into parking lot, we were met with angry/disgusted looks, and they yelled at us. Some of the things yelled at us: “Fags!”; “Fucking losers, get a job!”; “Get a life!”; However, many of the non-Scientologists that drove by sided with us, honking and yelling support."''

* '''Hollywood Blvd.'''

::''"Afterward, we headed back to Hollywood Blvd. to join back up with our group, which was now 200+ protesters. We went to the CNN building on Sunset Blvd. and protested out front, hoping to make it onto the news."''

::''"With this many people, the protest really hit its stride. We had organized chants of “We are anonymous! We are legion!” and “We do not forgive! We do not forget!”."''

<br><br>
<center>The San Francisco Chronicle has seemingly refused to cover the [[epic win]]. You can tell them that this decision is an [[epic fail]] by writing to letters@sfchronicle.com. If you hope to get your demand for [[lulz]] published, make it 200 words or less. Remember, this is to raise awareness, so make it so that non-anons can understand it (though subtle [[meme]] drops are excellent).  ({;})</center>

[[Image:Raptorjesusreturns.jpg|thumb|200px]][[Image:Code of Conduct.jpg|thumb|200px]]'''''Anons showed up at the Co$ on the corner of Washington and Montgomery around 11:0am Pacific time and swarmed the intersection surrounding the church. Maximum numbers are estimated around 200 - 250 at some points.  [[Raptor Jesus]] made an appearance and baptized the deserving, then he conversed with the local police, telling them of his extinction for their sins. All followed his example and followed the Code of Conduct. [[Tom Cruise]] also made an appearance and passed out fliers in penance for his wicked ways. There was no hostility from the Co$ save a few middle fingers out the window and an angry lady who sped off in a Porsche.  [[Monkey D. Luffy]] escorted the Anons on a massive march from Washington St. down to Market St. and back.  [[Scifag]] spies were suspected, including someone sitting on top of the building with a camera scouting out possible weaknesses in the anonymous hoards.  Police coverage was limited to an escort as the protesters marched down to Market and four or five cars parked outside of the Co$ building which eventually got bored and drove away.  News coverage included [[NBC]] News Channel 11 and several local paper interviews. (Any more updates on news coverage would be appreciated.)  Protesters stayed until about seven at night, then went home because their [[nuts]] were cold and they wanted a [[beer]]. The protest was deemed to be full of [[win]] and [[epic lulz]].'''''

''' ''Raid commenced at approximately 12:30PM Pacific Standard Time. Scifags and their private security awaited us. Very minimal interaction with them. They basically sat on their porch and watched us. Three makeshift teams formed. One team protested infront of the Scientology building On the north side of Sahara Ave with another group a little ways down the street. The final team protested on the south side of the street opposite the Scientology building. 
Police arrived on the scene, got bored, and left after awhile. Although, we still fully cooperated with their instructions even after they left. Channel 8 News showed up and filmed us briefly, but simply repeated a $cifag press-release word-for-word on the 11 o'clock news. Scientologists would not speak to us unless we didn't have masks. Two Anon volunteered to de-mask and speak with them. The Scifags dodged all questions, and stated they didnt have a PR Rep on hand. lulz. 
At it's peak, at 2:30pm, there were a little over 50 anon (not including scifag plants) protesting together. Over the duration of the raid, all-together, there were 75 "anon" (including scifag plants), with some leaving early and others coming late. In addition, there were also about 20 various scifag observers/plants/P.I.s hanging around, with at least one half-hearted attempt at "handling" but nothing serious. 
The protest dispersed around 4pm PST after discussing future plans. One group was possibly followed as far as the Strip, but anon managed to elude the pursuers.'' '''<br>

::''' ''Portland was Epic win, 20 Anonymous marched from Pioneer Courthouse to outside of the scientology building. Not soon afterwards, /b/lackup arrived at ten minute intervals, and soon Anonymous had gathered in a large group of [[Over 9000|Over 100]] Members. Ex-scientologists showed up to help, and were interviewed by Koin 6 and [[Fox News]] 95% of anonymous stayed anonymous. Approx. 8 members wore Guy [[EFG]] masks, while others wore bandanas and hats/hoodies. Official count was 120-150 Anon. Scientologists did not heckle us, but refused to speak. The doorman was a huge fat bald guy, while an older man and a brown-haired woman would walk outside to talk to them. The police were called multiple times, but found nothing unlawful about our protest. Final say, "[[epic win]]".'' '''
