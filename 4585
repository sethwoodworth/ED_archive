On June 4, 2004, a man in Granby, Colorado exacted his revenge against the [[Rachel Corrie|local government]] and a concrete factory being built adjacent to his muffler shop. That man was Marvin Heemeyer, and his revenge was the '''Killdozer'''. Deep inside the [[Tony Stark|Killcave]], he spent several months armoring the Killdozer with concrete and steel armor. He also installed several video cameras so he could see outside without risking being hit by pissed off [[Nazis|cops]]. For several hours on that day, many on the [[Internet]] followed closely the rampage of this man as his armor-plated bulldozer destroyed the homes and businesses of those who had wronged him. 

Granby is a town in the middle of the bumfuck Rocky Mountains whose whole population consists of 10 houses, 4 feral cats and a handful of sheep. Therefore, Heemeyer's conquest was almost a total success. Sadly, he ran over 2 of the feral cats. The military were even considering airlifting in small tank weaponry, until they learned the city they'd be defending was Granby, so the city was conceded to Killdozer.

[[Fag|One]] would think someone like this was either insane or evil, but he is hailed as a hero by [[ED|many]], <s>as</s> even though his trail of destruction left no one harmed in its wake. [[Goons]] in particular loved him and his actions, and reported on the events in a huge thread and several websites devoted to the Killdozer.

Heemeyer died as a result of Arnold Swarchenegger taking a big drill and drilling him, the only fatality to come from the situation. It took [[police]] two days to gain entrance to the steel/concrete-armored bulldozer. In the spring of 2005 Granby officials dismantled Killdozer and sold the parts to several different scrapyards, afraid fans would reassemble the pieces and go nuts on their own. Which is a shame cuz that would have looked totally kick ass on my lawn.
