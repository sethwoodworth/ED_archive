L-L-LUNAJACK!

[[Image:Lunajackprogress.jpg|thumb|A lunajack in progress]]
A '''Lunajack''' (usually written '''L-L-LUNAJACK!''') is a method used on [[4chan]] /[[b]]/ by a fan of minor ''[[Harry Potter]]'' character Luna Lovegood to derail threads. It consists of an initial image of Luna, together with the text ''L-L-LUNAJACK!'', followed by a stream of photos of Luna, both in the movie and IRL. Lunajacks have been used to combat sugar bitch [[harry Potter|Emmafags]], [[tits or gtfo]] [[Harry Potter|Tonksfags]], blatantly [[weeaboo]] [[Cho Seung-Hui|Cho fags]], [[cockmongler|cockmongling]] Fleurfags, Peter Parker-syndrome Ginnyfags, and the rare and elusive Padma/Parvatifags.

'''How to Lunajack:'''

# In the [[ass|text field]], type something involving L-L-LUNAJACK!, the mantra, or the [[copypasta]] further down this page.
# In the image field, choose an image of Luna, and submit.
# [[????]]
# [[PROFIT]]!!!
# Repeat 1-5 until the thread dies, to cleanse the thread of heathen non-believers.

[[PROTIP]]: When Lunajacking, always engage [[ALL CAPS|CRUISE CONTROL]].

== The History ==
In the weeks following the release of the film ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' (July 13, 2007), a growing number of /b/tards became followers of Luna. This culminated in a proposal to make her the only thing sacred on /b/. Despite great efforts, that effort failed, as usual, because of rules [[34]], 41, and 58. Luna is considered delicious pie, not [[cake]], as one [[anon]] called her a "pie-face, when your face is the shape of a pie" with an accompaniment of a motivational poster. [[Some argue|Some have suggested]] that Luna has a "voice that could melt diamonds." For a number of weeks, the Lunajack was briefly a proven way to counter the effects of [[Candlejack]]; however, it is believed that Candlejack has found a way to circumv

== The Obsession == 
For whatever reason, Luna has a stranglehold over certain [[retards]]. Rather than the generally accepted and expected "stick it in her pooper and do a barrel roll" comments, Luna is usually greeted with cries of admiration and longing by the giant pathetic fags that /b/tards are. In frequent renditions of copypasta, Luna is not the one you'd go on a one-night stand with, but rather pick her up on a date on Friday night, introduce yourself to her parents, take her out for a light dinner and a movie, drive her home, then walk her to her door step and kiss her on the cheek while promising to call her the next day. This bizarre enigma of human compassion has befuddled even the greatest minds of 4chan.

[[Some argue]] that it is because Luna is very much like the average /b/tard, especially when first encountered. Luna is depicted as socially awkward and almost completely isolated. But no one really cares because she's so cute. In recent interviews and videos, Luna's unsurpassed mixture of polite and proper behavior and sheer nervousness make her beyond adorable. Luna's [[IRL]] persona further matches that of many casual /b/tards: well-read, quite geeky, and a little socially backward.

==How to meet creepy little girls with affected accents and precious weirdness IRL==

Evanna Lynch, love of your life, fire of your loins isn't all that unique to those who have taught at the Mother of all Nerd Camps:  Johns Hopkins University's Center for Talented Youth.  Evanna herself attended CTYI (Centre for the Talented Youth of Ireland) which is loosely affiliated with and modeled after Johns Hopkins' program.  Should you decide to apply to be an instructor (BA required, MA desired), teaching assistant (required to be in BA program at a prestigious university), or an RA (a residential assistant who watches over the little fags, limited intelligence and Greek membership helpful, must be maniacally outgoing), you should know that application deadlines are usually January 31 of the year you wish to teach or herd nerds back into the nerdery.  There you can meet and [[pedophile|groom]] any number of precious little geniuses like Evanna Lynch, keep in touch with them, and visit them when they go off to college, and maybe get lucky.
