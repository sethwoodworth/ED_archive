Afro-chan
Officially, 4chan's first camwhoring black person (although technically, a [[mulatto|halfrican]]).

== History ==

She posted her [[niggertits]] early in May of 2006. In spite of trolls racially slurring her, she did not take the hint and kept posting. Becoming sick of /b/, afro-chan asked for a permaban by requesting [[bestiality|horses fucking women]]; Anonymous eventually delivered the permaban, and the [[nigra]] was never to be seen again. Eventually, afro-chan would discover LurkMore's ChanSluts (then called CHANCHAN), which the modfags eventually awarded her [[Unwarranted self-importance|moderation privileges and her own imageboard]].

== [[A challenger appears|A CHALLENGER APPEARS]] ==

On July 6, 2006, a black camwhore on Stickam showed up by the name of Anasha. Showing off more than her counterpart, /b/ proclaimed Anasha to be the true black camwhore, and was awarded the title [[Web 2.0|Afro-chan 2.0]]. Extremely [[butthurt]] about this, [[old meme|afro-chan]] went to her Stickam chat room, only to be promptly [[GTFO|trolled off the chat session]].

== afro-chan quits the Internets ==

On July 31, 2006, she deleted all the content from her image board and left the following message: 

{{quote|It has come to my attention that [[No one likes you|/b/ does not like me anymore]]. The only reason [[Trying too hard|I kept at it]] is because I had some false hope that [[Unrealistic expectations|/b/ would want me to come back]]. Turns out [[HA HA|I was wrong]], so [[Flounce|I'm done]]. [[BAWWWWW|If you're one of the people that hate me, you're getting your way, congrats]]|Afro-chan's statement of resignation}}.
