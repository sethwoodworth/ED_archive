The Lion King
[[Image:Lion King Raep.jpg|400px|thumb|The infamous deleted [[rape]] scene from the film.]]

Originally a <s>manga by Osamu Tezuka</s> Broadway musical, '''''The Lion King''''' was made into a movie [[last Thursday]] by the [[Disney]] company. Now, since nearly all the characters are covered in fur, this is (unsurprisingly) very popular with the [[furry]] community. The furfags draw many hentai pics of the characters, and will ruin your childhood. 

''The Lion King'' contains the voice acting talents of [[Star Wars|Darth Vader]], that kid from ''Home Improvement'', and the dude that played Ferris Bueller. This movie is peppered with subliminal sex messages and also contains references to [[Adolf Hitler]].

==Plot==
[[Image:Pedoscar444.png|thumb|left|Promo for an upcoming prequel.]]
The movie was about the "circle of life" or some shit. Basically when the king dies, his son is supposed to become king, but everything gets fucked up when a [[troll|jealous asshole]] tries to kill our protagonist so he can take his place at the throne (plot lifted from ''[[Hamlet]]''). In between all of that there are [[at least 100]] songs that the characters sing which will make your ears [[vomit]] (besides the "Be Prepared" song which is a subliminal Nazi song, and is thusly very cool.)

===Characters===

*'''Simba''': A whiny bitch that is afraid to become King because of his [[Emo|emo attitude]] and guilt that he indirectly killed his father. Simba's character is a little bit of a reference to [[Jesus Christ]].

*'''[[slut|Nala]]''': Simba's [[cocktease]] that finds him after he runs away. She's all like "Go back!" and Simba is like "No, fuck you."

*'''[[an hero|Scar]]''': A wicked badass motherfucker that murders his own brother. Scar is a parody of [[Hitler]], notice the "[[gay|Be Prepared]]" song, when he is <s>standing on the rock</s> sucking a [[cock]] and the Hyenas are Goosestepping like real [[Nazis]]. [[lie|Disney fuckin' rules]]

*'''Mufasa''': Voiced by Darth Vader's voice, Mufasa was king until he was [[pwnt|killed by Scar.]] His death is 9/11 for furries. Also christians got butthurt because he appears as a ghost later in the movie (which they think is BAAAAAD).

*'''[[monkey|Timon]] & [[fat|Pumbaa]]''': Also known as Chich and Chong, a couple of lazy, [[fat|gluttonous]] [[homosexuals]] that encourage Simba (and your children) to be an [[raukue|apathetic piece of shit]].

*'''black person, [[mexican|Banzai]] and [[retard|Ed]]''': Three hyenas that are Scar's goons. Banzai was voiced by Cheech Marin, Shenzi was voiced by Oprah Winfrey and Ed was voiced by Jim Carrey. When Banzai found out the film was not as racially diverse as he had hoped he said "Ethnic diversity my ass".

*'''Rafiki''': [[bix nood|Asante sana. Squash banana. Wewe nugu. Mimi apana.]] Asante sana. Squash banana. Wewe nugu. Mimi apana. Asante sana. Squash bananas [[in the ass|up his arse]]. Squash bananas up his arse. [http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/rafiki.asp]. Hey he's a priest, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au4tlMRI1eg&feature=player_embedded]

==Controversy==
[[lie|WHAT A SURPRISE]], black person AND SPICS COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS FOR BEING RACIST. TO SEE THE REAL REASON, SEARCH IT UP.

===Kimba===
Unbeknownst to most, ''The Lion King'' is a [[ripoff]] of a [[Japanese]] [[manga]] and [[anime]] series called the ''Jungle Emperor'' (''Kimba the White Lion'' in [[English]]). After realizing an opportunity to make a ton of [[money]], [[Disney]] shamelessly stole the Japanese classic. Disney then added a little ''[[Hamlet]]'' and the [[Bible]] into the plot in order to create the illusion of [[originality]]. They took Kimba and switched the "K" with an "S" in order to create Simba. Through selective [[copypasta|copying and pasting]], the Disney team  were able to disguise their [[theft]].

==Did you Know . . . ?==
*Apparently, someone got so caught up in this movie that they [[Lulz|committed suicide]] in the hopes they would [[WTF|come back as one of the characters.]] <s>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960411/ai_n14049131]</s> BALETED!

*[[Some argue]] that Nala is accually Simba's [[incest|half sister]] or cousin. Proof? [[Shit nobody cares about|Male lions will kill cubs of the pride that are not their own offspring.]]

==Lion King II: Simba's Pride==
As if the first movie wasn't enough to corrupt your children, Disney brought it upon themselves to make a sequel.  In true Disney fashion, the plot is [[copypasta|entirely unoriginal]], as the movie is essentially ''Romeo and Juliet'' with [[furries]].

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtBVX2rcpEw A sample of this movie's immense faggotry]

===New Characters===
*'''[[retard|Kiara]]''': The inbred result of Simba and Nala. It's clear that she has some sort of disability from her parents' [[incest|decision]] as she fails at everything.
*'''[[pimp|Kovu]]''': Despite being trained to kill Simba since childhood, he just says "ah fuck it" as he would rather [[sex|get some]] from [[whore|Kiara]] than fight Zira's war.
*'''[[Period |Zira]]''': Suffering from some sort of never ending period, Zira wants nothing more than to see Simba killed, and even sings some stupid song to prove it.
*'''[[pwnt |Nuka]]''': The only reason to watch this shitty ass film. ([[WTF|and he DIES]]?)
*'''[[incest |Vitani]]''': Zira's drone of a daughter. She apparently likes her brother Kovu alot, as she [[sex|pants like a bitch in heat]] when she sees him.
===[[shit nobody cares about|Deleted Characters]]===
*[[pimp|Chaka]]: Simba and Nala's non-existant son, [[Some argue|though some people]] *coughAkrilcough* still insist he was in the movie.
*[[bitch|Timira]]: Chaka's no-reason-to-be-there-except-as-a-future-bitch. Proof? When he was [[Delete fucking everything|deleted]], She was deleted.
*[[Shit nobody cares about|Binti]]: Zazu's girlfriend. But since he's [[gay]] she wasn't needed.

'''Fun Fact''':
Kovu was supposed to be Scar's son even though [[incest|that'd make him and Kiara cousins]]. That's the most obvious shit in the world yet disney still concepted it? [[Fail]].

==The story==
[[File:Harharkovu.jpg|thumb|400px]]
Since the directors of SP [[Copypasta|were not creative at all]] they cut out some carboard drawings of animals to dance around like tards when Kiara was presented.(Note: The cub at the of the first movie looks NOTHING like Kiara.) Afterwards we see the Tardcess about to run out into the world with a high possiblity of being stepped on or eaten with out babysisters. [[No|But does she care]]?

(Kiara, "Okay, Okay can I go now. Please?"

Simba says "Sure go ahead, but stay away from the outlands." Kiara ask why and Zazu explains. 10 seconds later [[fucktard|she ask the same question even though '''they just fucking told her'''!]])

Nope. Also, how is it that even though Simba is(or was. SP [[rape]]d all the 1st chars colors) gold and Nala is cream [[WTF|Kiara is ORANGE]]??? Must be a [[Retard|tard]] gene. So she runs off and her fail babysisters attempt and fail at keeping up with her(what tards lack in brains they make up in speed [[Common knowledge|apparently]]) and she runs of into the outlands where Simba, Nala, AND Zazu just told her not to go [[At least 100|literally 5 minutes ago]]. She bumps into her future owner Kovu. They go from growling at each other to almost being eaten and to Kiara shoving her vag in Kovu's face. Kovu goes [[WTF]]??? Understandable. Simba magically [[Vagina|pops out of nowhere]] roars at Kovu for no reason. Zira does the same. They talk, not saying anything important and leave.

Cue [[stupid]] pointless: "We are one" song

[[shit no one cares about|To the outlands]]!!

The [[crap]] lions live here(excluding Nuka). All we learn here is what Zira said 2 seconds ago= "[[All caps|SIMBA MUST DIE]]!!!!!11!11111!"

Then Kovu grows up, saves fail hunter Kiara from a fire(why? The world may never know...) and procceeds to molest every one of Simba's lionesses with his eyes( and nose.) until Simba tells him to [[gtfo]]. Kiara flirts with Kovu again, who [[fail|rejects]] her..again. Then they go hunting the next day in which Kiara fails again. The lesson SOMEHOW ends up in them being chased by rhinos. And for SOME REASON that teaches Kovu the defenition of "fun".(Which is stupid. Was he NOT playfighting with Vitani as a cub?)

Seeing Kiara has to the hots for Kovu, Simba invites Kovu into the [[orgy]] den. Vitani, who is panting like a bitch in heat whilst watching her brother be in a perfect spot to kill Simba, [[Do not want|does not approve]].

She snitches to Zira who goes "Kovu cannot betray us!"(Though [[obviously]] he can.)

Simba takes Kovu out on a walk to tell him some pointless circle of life crap(and [[Almost rape|probably rape him]]) but Zira and her pride have all come to gang[[rape]] Simba. [[lie|Zira implies Kovu cooked this up]] and Simba believes her( [[lolwhut]]). After being chased up and down Simba once again tells Kovu to Gtfo. No really. [[Win|It even has a song to go with it]]!

Kiara's upset about Quiffy's exile and runs away to look for him. After the most [[Sick fuck|sickening song in the entire movie]] is heard Kovu suggest they run away so they can [[fuck]] each other and forget everything else. Kiara insist they go back, and since he has no balls or a spine he listens to her. They go back to see Zira and Simba about to fight and jump in the way. Simba ask Kiara to "[[GET OUT|stand aside]]". Zira just tells Kovu to GTFO. Neither move, Kiara all of a sudden becomes smart and preaches Simba's own message to him.

Kiara and Simba nuzzle(hinting daughter/father [[incest]] fucking later on once the credits role).

Zira tells Vitani to do [[wat|something]], even though there was nothing to do in which Vitani says "No, fuck you. I'm going over to the good side with my brother so i can suck him off later. Cheers." Zira threatens her daughters life(looks like she wants Kovu to herself) the others are disgusted, ditch Zira, and join Simba. 

Does this phase Zira?

Of course not. She leaps at Simba and for no reason at all, Kiara jumps in her way sending them both [[suicide|over the side of a cliff]].

And look!

The dam broke. One of these bitches is going to drown. And you guessed right. It's Zira.

Everyone(even Kovu) forgets her death in the next scene and all go back to the Orgylands to live on Orgrock. And again, for no reason at all, Kovu, Kiara, Nala and Simba roar from Pride rock. 

Darth Vader...Mufasa says "Well done my son." Even though Simba '''[[lazy |DIDN'T DO SHIT]]'''!

==Typical Lion King Fanfiction==

<span class="co;[CLICK TO COLLAPSE];[CLICK TO EXPAND];0;lionkingfanfic"></span>
<div class=lionkingfanfic>

In the jungle, the mighty jungle, Simba had a sexual craving that could only be cured by a highly sexual lioness.

He leaned over to Timon and said, “Timon, I think I need a little bit of sex to fill that hole in my soul.”

Timon replied, “Why Simba, I thought you knew that me and Pumbaa here were a travelling two-man sex act from the beginning.”

x

Simba was five years old, newly exiled by his gay paedophilic uncle, and very thirsty. For sex. Being alone in a desert for as long as he was tends to have that effect on a lion.

A red-headed meerkat and a morbidly obese warthog stood before him.

“Who are you?” he said.

“I’m Timon,” said the meerkat, “and this is Pumbaa. We’re a travelling two-man sex act.”

x

“So, how about it?” said Timon, brandishing a breast.

“Nah, I’m not really into men,’ said Simba. “You know, I think it’s time you kept up with your promises and found me a girl.”

“When did we promise to get you a girl?” said Pumbaa.

“You promise that you’ll get me a girl every time my birthday comes around. Just as long as I let both of you have your way with me. Now I think it’s time--”

“Simba, I think it’s time for us to have our way with you again,” said Timon.

“Are you going to get me a girl?”

“How about we dress Pumbaa up in that grass skirt we have lying around?”

“Can we remove the penis?”

They looked at Pumbaa.

“No,” he said.

“Come on.”

“No.”

“Damn, we’re never going to find a use for that grass skirt and Hawaiian headpiece,” said Timon.

Many hours of unabridged sex followed, although, all throughout, Simba protested strongly.

“Stop it Timon. Stop it. Pumbaa, get your hoof out of my ass.”

“Hold on a minute,” said Timon. “Hey Simba, instead of protesting, how about you scream my name?”

“No,” said Pumbaa, “get him to scream his own name.”

“Yeah, that’s kinkier.”

“No wait,” said Pumbaa, “how about we get him to dance for us?”

“How are we going to sex him if he’s dancing?”

“Oh, right,” he said.

Simba had had enough. “Hey, how about you two go sex each other, and I’ll just be over there looking for some female genitalia?”

“Good idea,” said Timon. “No, wait a minute--”

But it was too late, and Simba was gone.

And Timon and Pumbaa were sexless.

A tumbleweed tumbled.

Timon turned to his life partner.

“So, you want to watch that TV series we made?”

“What,” said Pumbaa, “that Disney one?”

“Well it’s not like we’ve done any others.”

“Nah,” said Pumbaa, “I’d rather watch Brother Bear.”

“Jeez, Brother Bear?” said Timon. “I couldn’t bear that one. Get it? Bear? Bear, Brother Bear? I’m great, I know.”

A moment passed.

“Kiss me.”

x

Simba was tumbling through forest, ripping away at branches and spitting at things like an orphan having a seizure.

The kind of seizure you have when you’re watching a sadly underfunded Disney film.

He screamed every time a leaf tickled his back and started to cry every time he stepped on a thorn, but then he started having another seizure.

Also, he laughed every time he saw something that reminded him of female genitalia. Like your face.

(editor’s note: pwned)

A minute passed before Simba started to calm down. Ahead of him he saw a light that shone through the forest canopy. Upon entering it he found himself in a clearing. At the centre of the clearing, a really suck-ass PC sat on the damp leaf litter. The monitor was green with generic rolling hills. Whoever was here last had forgotten to log off their account.

Hah! He was going to take advantage of this.

Realising how long it had been since Simba had written anything proper, he summoned a chair and transfigured his paws into fingers so he could type. He spent far too long typing up a stupidly effortless piece of shit that he entitled “Can We Remove the Penis?” which starred himself and his homoerotic fantasies.

Everything was good until he finished and decided to save. Instead of actually saving the story, the suck-ass PC posted it on a generic fan fiction website (editor's note: not this one) and then the suck-ass PC teased him.

“YOU ARE THE SUX00RZ,” said the PC.

So he ate it.

“These computer chips sure taste good,” said Simba. He allowed a moment for Timon to congratulate him on the pun before realising that Timon wasn’t around. He was probably arguing with Pumbaa about whether they should watch Disney’s Timon and Pumbaa, or Brother Bear.

Simba was lonely.

x

Timon and Pumbaa stared at a screen. Two bears frolicked through a field of yellow flowers while Phil Collins sung.

“You know, this really sucks,” said Timon. “I really hate this. Why do I hate this, Pumbaa? I normally don’t mind Brother Bear.”

“I think it’s cause normally when we watch this, we’re ploughing Simba,” said Pumbaa.

“Nah, that was when we were watching our TV series,” said Timon. “Come to think of it, we might still be making it if that new director didn’t come and fuck everything up.”

“Then maybe it’s because we need Simba for something other than sex,” said Pumbaa.

“What? No way, I never heard anything more stu--hey, you know what?” said Timon. “Maybe it’s because we need Simba for something other than sex!”

“That’s what I just--”

“Timon, you’re a genius!” said Timon. He jumped upon Pumbaa’s back, but not like he normally did. “Mush, Pumbaa! We have to go... back to the future!”

“Timon, you have to stop breaking copyright--”

“I said mush, slave!”

Pumbaa then turned into the car from Back to the Future. Only, instead of carbon monoxide, the exhaust pipe emitted a jet of purely noxious fart.

(editor’s note: that day, thousands of square miles of foliage were ravaged by the gasses native to Pumbaa’s stomach. The government of Kenya put forth three billion dollars of taxpayers' funds to ensure that no Pumbaa-related destruction ever happened again. You can help. Please donate to Pumbaa-stop.)

x

The suck-ass PC was now inside of Simba forever. That was, until that fateful day when he literally shat out his insides. But that’s another story.

Simba left the clearing that once contained the suck-ass PC, then came across another clearing that looked exactly like the previous one. In fact it could have been the previous clearing except that it lacked one suck-ass PC, so Simba strolled into the light like a happy schoolgirl.

He was halfway through the clearing when he tripped on a root and broke all four of his legs. Simba fell onto his face, then writhed on the floor. He did not writhe because he was in pain--he writhed because damp leaf litter turned him on. After that, he laid face-up on the forest floor.

So here was Simba, boner-up, completely immobilised because of his broken limbs.

“I want to get up!” said Simba. “Please, I would give anything to get up!”

Now he was tired.

“On second thoughts, I would rather stay down.”

A really saggy lioness fell from the canopy, right onto Simba’s genitalia.

“That’s funny,” said the lioness, “because I would rather you stay down as well.”

So Simba and the lioness made sweet, sweet love, and Simba’s highly sexual needs were satisfied.

It was then that Timon and Pumbaa burst into the clearing. Timon wore a cowboy hat, and Pumbaa wore the clothing of a cabaret dancer.

“What the hell?” said Timon.

“Well, Timon,” said Pumbaa, “it appears that Simba is making love to a fallen tree branch under the belief that it is a lioness.”

“Would it be wrong to sit here and watch him?” said Timon.

“Yes,” said Pumbaa. “But let’s do it anyway!”

Simba later found out that it was really Timon and Pumbaa who were hallucinating, and that he really was making love to another lioness.

He also found out that the lioness was his mother.

(editor's note: due to the lack of funding to Pumbaa-stop, this parody must end here)

==Connections to Furries==
{{Squote|
There are about 10 or 12 TLK mucks out there, some doing better than others. There are about 40 or so private TLK RPG's out there (non forum) that are invite only. There are 40 or 50 or so forums.|The fact that most furries are [[white]] makes it even more confusing.}}

When the original movie came out in 1994 it was a huge hit with audiences - mostly [[children]] and their parents - all over the world. Over a decade later the obsession has not ceased. ''The Lion King'' is the ultimate movie for furries - [[at least 100|100%]] of all furries completely and utterly adore it far, far too much. Even more than [[Sonic]], even more than [[Rita]], and yes, even more than Robin Hood. A list of furries known to adore this movie (more than average) include:

*[[Dolphy]]
*[[Atimon]]
*[[Kovu 01]]
*KovuLKD  - A very obsessed lion king fan who made a game called [[fail|Impressive Title]]. Go check it out. <s>Google it.</s> [http://impressivetitle.proboards81.com LINK] [[wtf|(A Lion King Online Game)]]
