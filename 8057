Shamefully ignorant and criminally insane, '''Ted Stevens''' was an (ex)Alaska senator. Too old to understand things, Ted Stevens thought the Internet was a "series of tubes." Stevens, known as "Uncle Ted," was also the inventor of [[YouTube]], and wanted to [[Lie|make the internet better for you]] by getting rid of [[net neutrality]]. His most notable accomplishment was becoming an [[old meme]] the same day he became e-famous.

While it is occasionally acceptable for the senile to discuss things they actually experienced, such as World War I, it is both terrifying and lulz when the 79-year-old chief architect of the [http://www.heritage.org/Research/Budget/wm889.cfm Bridge to Nowhere] spoke forth on the [[internets]].  

As net neutrality is what you are used to, it is truly mind-blowing to imagine that a senile, adult-diaper wearing king of such hookers, blow and pork might actually be responsible for reducing every non-corporate website to what [[AOL]] users infested with [[spyware]] experience. Yet, this is modern life in [[New Orleans|America]], like it or fucking not. 

At some point in mid-2006, Ted Stevens appeared on [[shit_nobody_cares_about|whatever the fuck Senate panel he is on]], subservient to corporate interests, and [[fail|attempted]] to explain how the Internets work. The result was amazing, and millions of DailyKos diarists, users, and readers jerked off to it, believing that this was the ''tipping point'' in the war against the [[Republican|conservatives]]. Sadly, they will once again be wrong, as DailyKos nutjobs seldom have enough income to support their [http://www.nedlamont.com/ favorite candidates]. [[Oh noes|Once again, the capitalists win.]]



==Teh Internetz According to Ted==

<blockquote>"There's one company now you can sign up and you can get a [[Netflix|movie delivered to your house daily by delivery service]]. Okay. And currently it comes to your house, it gets put in the [[spam|mail box]] when you get home and you change your order but you pay for that, right.

But this service is going to go through the internet and what you do is you just go to a place on the internet and you order your movie and guess what you can order ten of them delivered to you and the delivery charge is free.

[[No more than 99|Ten]] of them streaming across that internet and what happens to your own [[MySpace|personal internet]]?

I just the other day got, an [[E-mail|internet]] was sent by my staff at 10 o'clock in the morning on [[Last Thursday|Friday]] and I just got it [[Last Thursday|yesterday]]. Why?

Because it got tangled up with all these [[porn|things]] going on the internet commercially.

So you want to talk about the consumer? Let's talk about you and me. We use this internet to [[AIM|communicate]] and we aren't using it for [[Amazon|commercial purposes]].

[[Image:GravelnStevens.PNG|thumb|Where the [[fail]] train began!]]
[[Image:Crackpiperoses.jpg|thumb|Series of tubes]]

[[Profit|We aren't earning anything by going on that internet]]. Now I'm not saying you have to or you want to discriminate against [[Niggers|those people]] [...]

The regulatory approach is wrong. Your approach is regulatory in the sense that it says "[[The Great Habbo Raid of July 2006|No one can charge anyone for massively invading this world of the internet]]". [[Moar|No, I'm not finished]]. I want people to understand my position, I'm not going to take a lot of [[time]]. [?]</blockquote>

<blockquote>They want to [[Torrent|deliver vast amounts of information over the internet]]. And again, the internet is not something you just [[Poop|dump]] something on. It's not a truck.

<blockquote><div style="text-decoration:blink"><big><big>'''It's a series of tubes.'''</big></big></div></blockquote>

And if you don't understand those [[Vagina|tubes can be filled]] and if they are filled, when you put your [[Penis|message]] in, [[Whore|it gets in line and its going to be delayed by anyone]] that [[Cum|puts into that tube enormous amounts of material, enormous amounts of material.]]

Now we have a separate [[Bantown|Department of Internet Defense]], did you know that?

Do you know why?

[[Masturbation|Because they have to have theirs delivered immediately. They can't afford getting delayed by other people.]]

[...]

Now I think these people are arguing whether they should be able to dump all that stuff on the internet ought to [[ED|consider if they should develop a system themselves.]]

[[Amazon|Maybe there is a place for a commercial net but it's not using what consumers use every day.]]

[[AOL|It's not using the messaging service that is essential to small businesses, to our operation of families.]]

The whole concept is that we should not go into this until someone shows that there is something that has been done that really is a violation of net neutrality that hits you and me."</blockquote>

''(Some people defend the concept by saying most stuff on the Internet is [[spam]], pictures of [[cat]]s, bad [[My Immortal|fanfiction]], and [[Chuck Norris]] jokes)''

==Home state==
Ted Stevens was the [[Bureaucratic Fuck|official]] senator for [[Alaska]].  As a [[Republican]], he fully supported drilling for [[oil]] in his state, causing a frothy mixture of dark oil with white snow commonly found in Alaska.  This is very similar to his colleague, [[Santorum]].

Other accomplishments:

* [[Omnetscient]]

==Corruption? In ''my'' Senate?==
[[Image:Corruptsenator.jpg|thumb|This is the last known picture taken of Senator Ted Stevens sometime [[last Thursday]] before [[Death|he was permab& IRL]].]]
As recently as [[Last Thursday]], Senator Stevens' Alaska Home was raided by [[The Man|teh Feds]] in connection with a corruption investigation. Stevens had this to say, 
<blockquote>[[Lie|"I continue to believe this investigation should proceed to its conclusion without any appearance that I have attempted to influence its outcome," Stevens said. "The legal process should be allowed to proceed so that all the facts can be established and the truth determined."]]</blockquote>

[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070731/ap_on_go_co/stevens_investigation_18 Lol, raid] (dead)

The raid spawned from an investigation into the VECO oil company's practices on its way to [[Over 9000|Tens of millions of dollars]] in [[Fellatio|federal contracts]]. The heads of the company have already [[pwnt|plead guilty to bribery and extortion and shit.]] It's pretty obvious from [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-31-stevens_N.htm?csp=34 this article] that even if Teddy isn't guilty of [[Fact|accepting bribes in exchange for contracts]], he and the oil company exec are [[Gay|in bed together]] anyway. Fuckin' racehorses.

===Indicted!===
[[Image:Series of Bars.jpg|thumb|right|A prison cell is not something you just dump someone in.  It's not a big truck.  It's, it's a series of bars.]]

As of July 29, 2008, Ted Stevens faced even [[moar]] heat and had been [[Law|indicted]] on [[7 Proxies|7 charges]] of making false statements about financial issues or something equally [[boring]], like [[Lol_wut|saying that an expensive chair he had owned for 10 years was "lent" to him.]].  It is presently unclear whether one of these false statements is Stevens' famous "tubes" remark.  All that is known is that Stevens was pretty much fucked and was being faced with a shitload of fines.  After the charges were brought against him, Stevens posted this message on his [[website]] (srsly):

{{quote2|I have proudly served this nation and Alaska for over 50 years. My public service began when I served in [[Old|World War II]]. It saddens me to learn that these charges have been brought against me. I have never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form required by law as a U.S. Senator.}}

===[[Pwnt|Convicted!]]===
As of October 27, 2008, Ted Stevens has been convicted on [[Over 9000|all 7]] corruption charges. In a fun twist, the still-[[butthurt|defiant]] Senator had (according to Yahoo News) "[[NO U|accused the Justice Department of unconscionable behavior in his prosecution]]" and declared that he will continue to run for re-election to the Senate. Since there is nothing barring convicted felons from [[Twinks|serving in the Senate]], Stevens will also be serving out his current term, pending [[Rape|action]] by Congress.

The Associated Press reports that Stevens claimed he could not oversee the project from thousands of miles away in Washington, so he had his wife pay the bills. That's what he gets for allowing her responsibilities outside of [[In the kitchen|the kitchen]].

[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/stevens_trial Full article]

Ted Stevens, if sent to prison, will quickly learn that "a series of [[Cock|tubes]]" has a [[Rape|whole new meaning]].

===Lost reelection bid!===

On November 18 - [[lulz|the day of his birthday]] - Stevens' career went down the tubes as he officially [[The game|lost]] his bid for reelection to [[Democrat]] Mark Begich and Alaska shocked the world by not electing a felon to the Senate and making everyone go "Maybe Alaskans aren't so [[Sarah Palin|stupid]] after all".

===ZOMG!!1!! Unconvicted!!!===

On April 7 2009, [[Retard|U.S. District Judge]] Emmet G. Sullivan threw out the convictions, accusing the prosecutors of being "a series of [[Newbie|noobs]]" for mishandling evidence and witnesses in the original trial.

{{quote|[[Lie|In 25 years on the bench, I have never seen anything approach the mishandling and misconduct in this case]]|[[Wanker|Judge Sullivan]]}}

This is despite several jurors stating that the evidence against [[pedobear|Teddy]] presented in the case was overwhelming. [[Bullshit|So that's alright then.]] Given he is now [[Over 9000|85]], the chances of his facing trial again are slim. And so, [[Republican|graet]] justice was served.

==The Day The Tubes Died==

On the night of August 9, 2010, Senator Cat Stevens [[Goodnight Sweet Prince|died]] in a plane crash in [[Alaska|Alaska]] while on his way to taking his cronies over to a fishing trip. Let's just be happy he didn't [[Old_people|crash the plane into a farmer's market]]. The crash was reportedly caused by a misunderstanding from the pilot, who thought the plane was something that you just dump something on, when in fact this is a highly dangerous practice. The pilot took a shit and within seconds the plane was down.
