/ck/
'''/ck/''', with posters affectionately known as '''co/ck/s''', is both one of the best and worst boards on [[4chan]]. Best, since [[food]] and cooking are actually discussed, and worst, because the only food that channers eat are [[ramen]] and [[pocky]], with the occasional jar of milk.

== Milk Jar Guy ==

'''Milk Jar Guy''' is possibly one of the worst memes ever, involving some random [[faggot]] who takes pictures of his milk jar meals, and uploads them to /ck/. It is uncertain why the combination of milk, jar, and guy is so [[rage]] inducing, but to co/ck/s it is. As such, reposting Milk Jar Guy photos are the best way to [[troll]] /ck/.

It is uncertain if new Milk Jar photos come from the original Milk Jar Guy, or if it's an attempt by someone else to troll /ck/. Most likely, it was an elaborate troll all along.

== Ramen ==

Despite claims by some co/ck/s that they are [[lies|chefs]] or [[lies|food connoisseurs]], most live off a diet of ramen and pocky.

== A Typical /ck Post ==

ATTENTION /ck/ I HAVE BEEN FORCED INTO A SITUATION WHERE I MUST PREPARE FOOD AND I AM EXTREMELY RUSHED ON TIME. YET I AM UNKNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE PROCESS, I HAVE NO MEANS TO PREPARE OR COOK THE FOOD AND I CANNOT SPEND MORE THAN $5 (MY WEEKLY ALLOWANCE). I HAVE NEVER READ THIS BOARD AND I HAVE NO INTENTION OF READING THIS BOARD AGAIN. OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS PREDICAMENT BEFORE. ALSO I'M COOKING FOR AN EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE GIRL I'M INTO IT MUST BE VEGAN AND GLUTEN FREE AND I AM ALSO A GIRL (IN BEFORE NO GIRLS ON THE INTERNET AND YES I HAVE A BOYFRIEND). ALLOW ME TO WORD THIS IN THE FORM OF A CHALLENGE OR GAME IN THE VAIN HOPE THAT THIS WILL SEEM MORE INTERESTING. DO EVERYTHING FOR ME GO!

== Trolling Techniques ==

* Best way to troll /ck/ is to start a thread about chili, and whether it's appropriate to put beans in.  [[Srsly]], it makes cut versus uncut /b/ threads look rational as [[redneck]] Texans scream at [[fat]]ass midwesterners.
* Another (though not as good) way to troll /ck/ is to post about [http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&source=imghp&biw=1600&bih=707&q=golden+opulence&gbv=2&aq=f&aqi=g4g-m1&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai= this desert], and make sure you say that it looks like it's completely worth all $1000 and probably doesn't [[Lie|taste like shit]].
* Ask about the proper way to cook a steak.  PROTIP:  Well-done with ketchup
* Extol the virtues of Pink Himalayan Salt
* Be [[Angie]]
