Shota-ku
{{boring}}
[[Image:Shotacat.png]]
"[[Shota-ku]]" is a contemporary [[pedophile]] verse form invented by [[Dylan Thomas]], former webmaster of www.boychat.org.

Shota-ku consists of lines of seven, eleven, and five syllables, and traditionally expresses poetic admiration for a teenage boy's beauty, sexual dynamism, and "death," whether in the sexual or mortal sense.  Shota-ku are often inserted in larger compositions, serving to mark high points of pedophile sentiment, and are traditionally read by [[Lemon_party|small cliques of soft-spoken gentlemen]], who meet quarterly at the four great festivals of the pedophile year:  Winter IBLD (solstice) the spring [[Strawberry Festival]], Summer IBLD, and Halloween.

Although the [http://www.villagevoice.com/livoice/9949,feature,10895,0.html Village Voice article] on Sam Manzie is good, it is particularly interesting to watch the mainstream media wake up to the presence of the [[goddess of the internet]] and the particular kinds of sacrifices she demands in this Newsweek article: [http://www.newsweek.com/id/97149 Did the net kill Eddie?]

===Seneca's Phaedrus, line 761-3===
[[Image:Archaeologicalpark01Hippmosaic.jpg|thumb|I dunno, looks kinda pixilated to me...]]
Anceps forma bonum mortalibus<br>
exigui donum breve temporis<br>
ut velox celeri pede laberis!<br>
This 3-line ejaculation, lines 761-3, (which can be metrically described as [4 x {Dactyl, Spondee}]) is the rhetorical climax of a carefully structured metrical show-piece, a choral hymn to young male beauty.  (736-823)
* 736-752 A
* 753-760 B
* 761-763 C <----The lines in question
* 768-823 Lots of B
* (No return to A; play continues with Act 3 in "normal" Iambic Trimeter)
Various gods are listed, and at the climax the doomed Hippolytos is said to be prettier than them all....BUT only for a short time!  The cherry-blossom falls; and line 762 is the very slash of the sword terminating the vision, and thus making it immortal.  Young ''death'', of course, is implied in "short-lived."  For 3 lines, the chorus rings with the spiritual exaltation of beholding the very "form" of beauty.   I'm thinking of the Japanese aesthetics of NOZOKU, or peeping-tom.... 
*This would be a "normal," fairly literal translation, emphasizing the visual and spiritual over the physical:<br>
Beauty is not given to mortals forever:<br>
A brief moment's gracious glimpse...<br>
And rapidly your swift feet carry you away.<br>
* And this would be a "shota-ku" translation:

Beauty belongs to the gods.<br>
