Fan History
'''Fan History''' is a wiki about [[fandom]].  Like everything else in fandom, it thinks it matters more than it does and can't acknowledge that it is insane.  It caters to [[Anime]] fans, [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] fans, ,[[Firefly]] fans, [[Furry|furries]], [[Harry Potter]] fans, [[Lord of the Rings]], [[Star Trek]], [[Star Wars]], and [[Twilight]].

==A history of the history of Fan History==
[[At least 100 years ago]], some [[Shit no one cares about|no name fan]] (as opposed to big name fan) created Fan History for the lulz and to get back at other fandom peeps she didn't like.  This effort was cloaked under the legitimacy of trying to write the history of fandoms that the no name fan liked.  No body cared and no body participated.  No name fan worked harder and harder and more and more people didn't contribute until such a time that one person contributed.  And then two people.  And then twenty people.  Then the no name fan decided to create articles about people, attack the greatness that is the [[Organization for Transformative Wank]] and wank in a way to get traffic. [http://dejana.livejournal.com/152580.html]  When she did that, the site broke and it died.  [http://dejana.livejournal.com/152580.html There was much rejoicing in]   [http://community.livejournal.com/metafandom fandom.]  She tried to [http://blog.fanhistory.com/?p=31 apologize] but no one cared or if they did care, it was to say  [http://hector-rashbaum.livejournal.com/214405.html?format=light "I DUN'T ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY AND YOU SHOULD GIVE A FUCK CAUSE I MATTER!  ALSo, YOU ARE A MONEY GRUBBING FURRY!"]

* Women
* Lesbians

===Enemy number one===
Fan History's number one enemy is [[Sick fuck|Naomi Novik]], the fan fiction writer known as [[Sick fuck|Asotlat]].  Naomi Novik is made of [[sarcasm|awesome]] because she writes [[fanfiction]] and [[original fiction]].  In order to get loads of screaming fan girls to read her books, Naomi Novik connected her real name and her fan name all over the place so that anyone could google or read would know in less time than it took [[David Duchovny]] to check into rehab.  It was public knowledge.

When Naomi Novik's fan girls realized that enemies of the [[Organization for Transformative Wank]] had posted information, they fucking creamed themselves in their efforts to get Naomi Novik to recognize their [[awesome]].  Naomi Novik encouraged them because she has control issues.  Her enemies cannot talk about her and share information she puts out for public consumption.  Only Naomi Novik can.

To get around the fact that [[Mary Sue|Astolat]] told everyone that "TEE HE HE HE! I AM NAOMI NOVIK! BUY MY BOOKS! BUT DON'T LET CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN BTARDS KNOW THAT [[Pedophiles|I WRITE KIDDY PORN]]!  I WILL LOSE MORE READERS THAN I GAIN!" her fangirls said her privacy was violated because AT ALL COSTS, YOU MUST ALLOW THE [[Pedophiles|KIDDY PORN]] [[fanfiction|FAN FICTION]] TO BE PUBLISHED AND NOT HURT YOUR IMAGE!

==A history told before==
* Cassandra Claire: Cause plagiarism is okay! Only when it isn't!  Like when you have 15,000 fangirls 
* CSI fans: Cause fans wank the same thing over and over again and can't figure out why they keep doing that 
* FanFiction.Net: Cause you gotta have info on fandom's porn yet we dun allow porn home 
* RangerPhiles: Cause you gotta write about furry pedophiles
* [[Star Trek]]: Cause you need to know about the idiots who claimed to have started this all.
* Supernatural: Cause some one has to document that batshit where the fans love incest vids and fic

==Demographics==
[http://www.quantcast.com/fanhistory.com/demographics Traffic comes from Asian teens who don't know better who have lots and lots of kids for being so young which probably cause they're poor having completed college when they were ten.]
