'''Alexis Arquette'''<sup>[[âœ¡]]</sup> (born July 28, 1969) is an [[United States|Americunt]] [[bisexual]] [[transvestite]], [[attention whore]], B-movie actor, drag queen, and all around [[sick fuck]].  His article on [[Wikipedia]] from which this is sourced, has been heavily guarded and sanitized for years by the Tranny Cabal, who get extremely [[butthurt]] when any mention is made that Arquette has a [[penis]] and revert the truth on sight.  In [[TOW]]'s article on The Surreal Life, some [[fucktard]] wrote that "Arquette brings the transgender community increased visibility and awareness with her appearance in the series."  This is not only [[lulzy]] patent nonsense, but proof that [[tranny|trannies]] are [[batshit insane]] and think that any publicity is good publicity.

===The Boring Shit===

He was born '''Robert Arquette''' in Los Angeles, [[California]] into ''the'' Arquette family to a Jew mother and a convert [[Muslim]] father.  His brother David is famous for playing [[retard|retards]], his sister Roseanna starred with him in Pulp Fiction as "that chick with all that fucked-up shit in her face," and his formerly [[hawt]] sister Patricia is a dentally-challenged [[fatty]] famous for her fangtooth.  Since Jew determine who belongs in their club matrilineally, as ''mater semper nota est'', Bobby Arquette comes under the protection of not only Wikipedia's Tranny Cabal, but the [[The Wikipedia Jews|Jewish Cabal]] as well.

=== Career ===
At 22, '''Bobby Arquette''' landed his first significant acting role, playing a [[transvestite]] (quelle surprise!) Georgette in ''Last Exit to Brooklyn''. Sixteen years later, he went through his own imaginary transition from male to female, an experience that was documented in the film, ''Alexis Arquette: She's My Brother'', which debuted at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.  This film included '''no evidence''' that Arquette had undergone '''vaginoplasty''', so it's safe to assume that he didn't.  No pics, it didn't happen.  Fortunately lesser known than his siblings, the majority of his film work has been limited to low-budget or independent films. He also appeared in ''I Think I Do,'' ''Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror'', ''Sometimes They Come Back... Again'', and ''Killer Drag Queens on Dope'' among 40 other independent pictures/pieces of [[crap]].

One of his more amusing indie roles was as a male prostitute in the film ''Frisk'', a loving story about a gay serial killer who, unlike most gays, wants to love his partners not only on the outside, but the inside as well by [[Dissected-chan|dissecting]] them.  Arquette's prostitute character enraged the killer because he was able to take so much big, hard [[Giant dildo of death|dick]] without crying out, just like Arquette [[IRL]] no doubt.

Arquette has appeared in supporting roles in mainstream films, including ''Pulp Fiction,'' in which he played the man with the "motherfucking hand cannon" and ''The Wedding Singer'', in which he minced around as a [[fag|Boy George]] impersonator, singing "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?" over and over.

===The Buffoonery and the Drama===

On January 31, 2007, Arquette was a featured celebrity client and guest judge on the premiere episode of [[gay]] channel Bravo's ''Top Design'', where he was described by one of the contestants as "Iggy Pop in drag".  On February 26, 2007, Arquette was promoting the DVD Release of ''Killer Drag Queens on Dope'' on ''The [[guido|Adam Carolla]] Show''. [[attention whore|Danny Bonaduce]], a co-host, asked Arquette if he had a penis. The question, and his refusal to answer, sparked an argument between [[guido|Carolla]], Bonaduce, and Arquette, ending in Arquette storming out of the studio and violently pushing sound equipment at them as he was leaving.

Arquette appeared in VH1's "The Surreal Life 6" in which he showed through teary outbursts and moments of [[sick fuck|sick fuckery]] exactly why he is a [[bisexual]] [[transvestite]] instead of a [[transsexual]], not that that state of [[fail]] is any better.  
:
*His morning routine being shown in some detail, the viewer could plainly see that without all his glad rags and [[faggotry]], he is a balding, middle-aged man who wears fake silicone bra inserts and prefers dresses that hide his [[dick|fruitbowl]].
*He hit on fellow cast member Andrea Lowell, a former Playboy playmate who currently sells [[dildo|dildos]] in the middle of the night on the [[vagina|Oxygen]] channel, telling her that she could be his last fuck before he got neutered.  She declined in spite of the high-pressure sales tactic urging her to act now on this fabulous opportunity.  This fact has been reverted numerous times by the owners of the Wikipedia article on Arquette, in spite of the fact that it is absolutely true.  It must be bad press for trannies.
*He cried like a [[16 year old girl]] when Tawny Kitaen, real woman, asked to borrow his wig.  "Borrow my wig?  What the hell does she think?  It's a ''part'' of ''me''!"  Any genuine tranny would not need a wig to still be delusional enough to believe he was a woman.
*He repeatedly bragged about his giant [[cock]].
