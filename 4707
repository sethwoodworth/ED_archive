Also known as acid, "the red pill", "the [[Jewry]] vaccine", and [[Weev|LOLSD]], '''LSD-25''' is pure, liquid ruin commonly soaked into gelatin and blotter tabs. It was first synthesized on November 16th, 1938(over 100 years ago), by [[Switzerland|Albert Hoffman]] (Who became 102 years [[old]]!). Because his trip started on his bicycle ride back home on April 19th, 1943, the 19th of April is celebrated by [[hippies]] every year as [[Lolwut|"Bicycle Day"]] with shitloads (0.1 mg) of LSD. When you consume LSD, your mind will go into [[rave|overdrive]] and you will [[Goatse|see things that human eyes were never meant to see]]. You will tell yourself that it's just a drug and you are hallucinating, but deep down, you will know that the demons, vibrating walls, and flying rainbow dongs are ''very'' real. Taking acid will also make you an enemy of the Kike Regime, doomed to bear the weight of dissatisfaction with society and hatred of its money-worshipping parasites. But hey, it's better than the alternative: being a pussy-ass [[faggot]] and going through life knowing that men in red Pendleton shirts are getting incredible kicks from things you'll never know.

==Basics of LSD==
Anyone who's taken LSD can assure you that it's like nothing [[Original_Content|you've ever seen before in your life]]. <BR><BR>
Because of this, it's not as popular as a recreational drug as weed and alcohol.   
<BR>

====LSD IS SERIOUS BUSINESS====
LSD [[4chan|is, was, and can be a wonderful drug.]] However, [[newfags|some people]] choose to [[Trolling|use it for the wrong reasons and at the wrong times]]. This results in all that [[Fox_news|negative propaganda]] you hear about it. Most people agree that when you start to see shit moving, hear colors, and see sounds that something's probably [[batshit_crazy|a bit off]]. The fear of 'bad trips' is retarded. You can only have a bad trip on LSD if [[YOU_ARE_DOING_IT_WRONG|you're doing it wrong]]. Because of this, new LSD users should be really careful because they're about to see shit that will change their life.  This is also common amongst most [[13-year-old_boy|irresponsible recreational drug users]] who use LSD with the same lack of caution as they do weed or coke. You have been warned.<BR>
However, it is NOT addictive, leaves the bloodstream within a week of consumption, and is dosed in such small amounts that the amount of LSD it would take to overdose would cost you thousands of dollars. <BR>
People who don't suck will tell you LSD is awesome. They are right.<BR>

====LSD IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA====
LSD can be taken in any situation, whether lunch break, the middle or the night, or an hour before your best man speech. You will always have time for nine solid hours of not understanding what the fuck reality is, so you should drop acid all the time. ALL the time. LSD has nothing to do with failed mind control projects by [[CIA]]

==LSA==
By eating 400 seeds from the Morning Glory flower or 2 from Hawaiian Baby Woodrose , you can produce a mild LSA (read: LSD for pussies) trip that is followed by nausea and puking your guts out if you eat the seed coatings by mistake instead of the happiness inducing centre of the seeds. Some people even find it useful to grind the seeds up and let it sit in water or alcohol. This makes it so you need twice as many seeds for the same effect. LSA is not LSD, and people who call ground Morning Glory seeds sitting in water "Acid" should be shot on sight.

'''[[PROTIP]]:''' All the nausea/side effect causing chemicals are on the seed casing. So if you scrape the casing off until its just cream coloured, you will be fine. Alternatively you can grind them up, put them in a teabag and leave them in a pint of distilled water with a splash of lemon to extract the LSA. Bright light and chlorinated water kills LSA. 

'''[[PROTIP]]:''' Crush the seeds into a fine dust, mix them into water and [[Fellatio|hold it in your mouth and suck on it]]

'''[[PROTIP]]:''' Hawaiian baby woodrose can give the same effect with 10 seeds, though it only grows wild in...[[Barack Obama|Hawaii]].  But you can order them [http://www.iamshaman.com/ here]. Happy puking, kids!
