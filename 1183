'''BrokeTheInterweb''' ([[IRL]]:[[whore|Ashley Carey]]), is a <s>[[16-year-old girl|16-year-old]] [[cunt]]</s> [[13 year old boy|21-year-old]] [[cunt]] and professional [[attention whore]] probably best known for [[butthurt|bawling her eyes out]] on [[Faux News]], [[last Thursday]]. And while Jewtube is chock full of little sluts like her, what really sets her apart from the rest of the Ray William Johnson clones is her '''HUGE''' victim complex, by which always tries to make herself look like the "good guy" in any situation. In addition, she has recently had the [[shame|honor]] of becoming the [[Internets]] newest [[Jessi Slaughter]]. By this point, it is estimated that she will become [[An Hero]] in [[at least 100]] days.


== My thoughts on TROLLS ==
This video was uploaded in response to the [[newfags]] posting ALLCAPS hate mail on her Youtube videos. She says the tears were fake, even though any [[you|decent minded person]] knows the [[Truth]]. Later this lulz-fest of a shitburger would receive national coverage on [[Faux News]] a year and a half later.

== Miley Cyrus cover - See You Again ==
Ahhhh..... The sweet odor of a 16-year-old [[attention whore]] with absolutely no talent whatsoever. In this obvious [[epic fail]], our future <s>hero</s> [[an hero]] covers that whore [[Miley Cyrus]]'s shitty bubblegum pop [[shit|hit]] "See You Again." Notice how overconfident and happy she is singing. Then realize how much she sucks hard. BrokeTheInterweb never had this second realization.

== An American Hero - Obama's Congressional Forum on Healthcare ==
It only seems fitting that in addition to being an ugly, and unloved skank, she is also an ultra-[[fundie]] [[creationist|creatard]] with a personal vendetta for anyone who isn't as white as her paranoid redneck family. Throughout the video she maintains this condescending and ignorant thought that anyone who doesn't support this loon senator she [[faps]] to so much will go to hell because in her mind [[Fred Phelps|God]] only loves [[Faux News|sheeple]] with no minds.

== ADD is Real ==
Like many [[chris-chan|infamous Youtubers before her]], BrokeTheInterweb likes to blame all her life problems on a clearly false and non-existent mental or physical disorder. The disorder she claims to [[lie|"oh so obviously" have]] is Attention Deficit Disorder or ADD or [[Retard|"My Child is Special"]] syndrome. As [[you|anyone]] can clearly see, she is not even close to being shy about sharing her problems with the world.

== California Gurls Piano Cover- Feat. Interpretive Dancing California Style ==
This is when the rancid horse-shit really begins to hit the fan. When BTI uploaded this lulz-fest of a video-fail wayyy back in 2010, she basically came out onto all of the internet and shouted as loud as she could "Hello world, I'm a big fat redneck hoe slut who is [[rape|anally raped]] on a daily basis." We all knew singing off key whilst dancing in tiny panties is never a good way to make E-Friends. This video just proves it.

== The Bieber Sonata ==
Because of all the hate that this video received following being uploaded to Jewtube Ashley felt prompted to tell the world her about epic struggle with the troll legions via mainstream media. Sadly for her though, only [[Faux News]] would accept a story this shitty.

== Faux News ==
Then, in a surprising move, BTI took for the television in an extremely sad, [[Butthurt]] attempt at making the [[internets]] and television audience feel contempt for a few /b/tards and EDiots writing shit on her Youtube channel. The fact that Fox would even think to include Boxxy alongside BTI just goes to show how fucktarded Republican people are. Notice the similarity between [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGJIFl9X8iw Jessi Slaughter's news appearance] and this tool's. Shocking, isn't it.
