'''Tom Cruise''' (aka ''''Thomas Cruise Mapother IV''', born '''Jehuda Abraham Cohen'''), was a short 4' 2" arrogant and small penised famous Hollywood star before he went [[batshit]] crazy. He had the upmosts misfortunates of both being born [[ghey]] and gay. Every self-loathing anal retentive [[Oprah]] fan wants to be penetrated by Tom Cruise's shriveled thetan-shooting sausage cannon. He is the reason [[Rosie O'Donnell]] is a [[lesbian]] and Nicole Kidman is a [[pedophile]].  Tom Cruise was recently indicted because he [[pwn|killed]] a [[England|British]] soldier in [[Iraq]], where he was seen donning his Maverick costume and firing up his "Topgun" F14 [[IRL trolling]] Brits. [http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2007060144,00.html] As [[Lie|Scientology allows you to still be a part of other religions]], Tom Cruise is also a [[Satanist]] and likes a big fat one in the mouth, in addition to being renowned for being a [[Not_gay|controlling lavendar bastard]].

===Biography===
Reincarnated from the ashes of [[jark|Xenu]] at the base of [[deviantart|Mount Fuji]] by the [[Disabled_Village_Children|Scientologists]] to fulfill their goal of world domination, and spread the teachings of Scientology. 'cause it's [[srs|real and everything]].

==="Spouse"===
He and little Davey M, are currently whoring about with [[Katie Holmes]] in the ongoing [[IRL drama|struggle]] to maintain anything resembling [[celebrity]]. When this [[not gay|'arrangement']] became public it prompted a whole bunch of Dawson's Creek fans to go [http://freekatie.com/ buy t-shirts] in order to [http://www.freekatie.net/ Free Katie!!!].  

[[Image:KatieholmesSOULEATEN.jpg |thumb|Harboring placentafags sperm turns women into fucking zombies]]

[[Lulz]] ensued when Katie declared that she was converting to [[Scientology]].  Hopefully she will look less plain, so [[Olene|looking like her]] will be more challenging. However, despite the [[Friends_list|'spiritual bond']] and the bastard child Suri, the couple remain unmarried.

== Psychological State ==
He is Batshit crazy!!!!!! and I can not emphasize this enough. Anyone that believes xenu is fucking crazy; also he jumped on Oprah's sofa screaming "I love Katie Holmes." But in reality, she is being held in Tom's basement with his man-slaves.  

===Public Opinion===
[[You|More and more people]] are convinced that Tom Cruise is bugnuts crazycakes and would benefit from some of the psychiatric care he loathes so intensely. It is also believed by many Atheists that god is proven to not exist, by the fact that Tom Cruise is somehow allowed to continue living. They are correct.<BR><BR>

===[[Dead babies|Spawn]] of [[Satan|Scientology]]===
After [[BDSM|sacrificing]] his career to [[L. Ron Hubbard]], [[baby]] Suri was delivered to the Holmes [[menstruation|womb]] via spaceship on or around [[last Thursday|April, 2006]]. Cruise then went on record in GQ magazine as saying he would eat the placenta [http://www.amateurgourmet.com/the_amateur_gourmet/2006/04/tom_cruises_pla.html] because he'd seen a very tasty recipe on a box of '''Placenta Helper'''.
[[Image:yum_placenta.jpg|thumb|It is delicious placenta.  You must eat it.]]
[[Image:$OCLAWL.jpg|thumb|Tom loves sharing jokes with Scientology friends.]]
As for the name, well he probably saw that in a [[:Image:Mac_User1.jpg|J. Crew]] catalog because a Suri is one of two varieties of the [[animal|alpaca]] -a domesticated breed of [[Mexican|South American]] llama-like [[furry|ungulates]]. [http://surinetwork.org/] It looks like a sheep in appearance, but on stilts and has a long [[erection|erect]] neck. It's also highly prized for its [[Fursuit|fleece]], which is lighter and silkier than wool. Either that or the [[aliens]] delivered the wrong package, because it took a full six months for the alleged [[abortion|baby girl]] to be unveiled.

Caught in a [[what|"YOU WHAT?"]], Holmes scrambled to cover up the [[idiot|gaffe]] by explaining that Suri, is the [[Arab]] word for a "red rose". Cruise, however, stated that the name is Jew for [[13 year old girl|"princess"]], which [[User:Blargh|language experts]] then said "[[lulz|LOLDONGS]]! [[NO U]]!!!1. [[Cunt]]."

The most plausible [[fact|theory]] thus far is that "Suri" is a misspelling of [[England|Surrey, England]], (the former home of L. Ron Hubbard), because Tom is [[dyslexic]]; or was so before Scientology cured him...'''NOT'''!!!1 [http://www.beliefnet.com/story/129/story_12944_1.html]. [[Lulz]]!

There were also [[fact|rumors]] that Tom planned to put a binky in Katie's mouth during birth because scientologists believe [[Cthulhu|loud noises to let Xenu devour your child's soul]] or some shit.[http://defamer.gawker.com/165291/tom-cruise-keeps-katie-holmes-pacified] If Tom had just wanted to have her silent he could have easily taken a [[bondage|gag]] like sane [[men]] wanting their women to [[stfu]]. However, [[facepalm|using a pacifier]] proves that Tom is actually an [[adult baby]] who probably also gets off on shitting digested placenta into his diapers.

==Recent shenanigans==
[[Image:CrazyTom.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Such a shame . . .]]

===Short===
[[Image:tomtrolled.jpg|thumb|Tom is easily trolled on Wikipedia.]]
Tom (Douche) Cruise is actually a [[midget|hobbit]]. He has had rumored [[homosexual]] relations with Sam Wise Gamgee and he is literally 5 foot 1 which makes him a [[Shortman|Shortman]] even in the hobbit's world. Many men like him only because he is not only a walking headjob but even if you're a huge loser(see: Fernando Alonso) you're still taller than him.

===Today Show===
Further cementing the fact that's he's gone off the rails, Mr Cruise has recently [http://tinyurl.com/9owkv spoken out] against [[psychiatry]], declaring it a "pseudo-[[science]]".  A citizen's watchdog group funded by [[Scientology]] later [http://tinyurl.com/c4cp7 spoke out about Tom Cruise speaking out].  This prompted millions of 50-year-old bi-polar wives to forsake their medication in an attempt to be serviced by Mr. Cruise.

On June 24, [[2005]], Tom Cruise made a controversial appearance on the Today Show.  During his interview with host Matt Lauer, Cruise referred to actress Brooke Shields as a "crazy-ass bitch." He stood on top of a table, and while holding his stomach in, Cruise loudly mocked weatherman Al Roker (nearby off camera) for allegedly following the Atkins Diet. He had to be removed from the studio after removing his shirt and threatening to "draw these guns on Lauer".

===Oprah===
[[Oprah]] got [[rape]]d by Mr. Cruise in front of live studio audience [[last Thursday]]. She later gave out free SUVs to all the members of the audience to celebrate.

===Officially coming out of the closet===
[[Image:IYBRAINshattersupression.jpg|thumb|Your Hero]]
He finally came out of the closet in an episode of the show '[[South Park]],' in which he enjoyed the closet until he realized that he was a major tool and a freak. His ex, Nicole Kidman, was quoted as saying, "Don't you think this has gone on long enough? It's time for you to come out of the closet. You're not fooling anyone." He then gave into his inner urges and came out of the closet.

Cruise reportedly went all [[ghey]] on Paramount and threatened to sue if the offending program was ever shown again.
Later on he decided to boycott the ''Mission Impossible 3'' promotion, when the "Coming Out of the Closet" episode got a go-ahead for a re-run screening. The episode was later replaced with Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls episode, and Isaac Hayes got butthurt about the Scientology jokes and quit the show. [[South Park]] declared war on Cruise and his many disciples and said, "So, Scientology, you may have won THIS battle, but the million-year war for earth has just begun! Temporarily antagonizing our episode will NOT stop us from keeping Thetans forever trapped in your pitiful man-bodies.... Curses and drat! You have obstructed us for now, but your feeble bid to save humanity will fail! Hail Xenu!!!" This drama was repeated for the South Park episode ridiculing Catholics called Bloody Mary, which has been pulled off the air in particularly Catholic sensitive areas.

Nicole Kidman said later 'Tom has problem with healthy society hating him because he is short, if the dirty dysfunctional gays where to also reject him for being short when he comes out of the closet he couldn't mentally take it.  I suspect he would have another mental break down and run round telling anybody who would listen that aliens where coming to earth to make him taller again'

===Officially hates farts===
Tom's apparent hatred for farts has infuriated him to the point of [[insanity]]. He has decided to use forensic evidence by way of a hidden camera (lol, [[pervert]]) to find the person and fire that person. He has therefore recognized himself as a [[douchebag]].

===BEST BIRTHDAY EVAR!!!!===
Tom Cruise recently celebrated his birthday on the [[Scifag]] mothership, <i>[http://www.holysmoke.org/cos/free-winds.htm "Free Winds"]</i>. In this video you can see him [[Gay|sing]] and [[gay|dance]]. Clearly he is a [[Lie|perfectly sane, well adjusted person]].
{{quote|"This is incredible... It's the best birthday ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, and I mean ever!"|[[13 year old boy|Tom Cruise]]}}
{{quote|"Whoa.....Thankyou..... HAHAHAHAHA"|[[13 year old boy|Tom Cruise]]}}  Notice that Tom's BFF David Miscavige is at least three inches shorter than Tom, even after you add the stilts. [[Trying too hard|Also notice how buff David is trying to look; his t shirt can barely contain his bowflex induced gun show]]. And all it took was just twenty minutes a day. And wearing a t shirt 3 sizes smaller than normal.

**Video removed? Boo**

==Secret life==
[[Image:Gay tom cruise.jpg|thumb|right|400px|In a rare moment of clarity, WikiSearch finds what you're looking for.]]
Tom Cruise <s>may or may not be</s> is a [[pedophile]].  There is [[evidence]] to support this apart from Mr. Cruise's personal collection of photographs depicting four-year-olds reenacting the [[lemonparty]] in Mr. Cruise's basement dungeon.  He regularly posts these photographs on his personal [[LJ]].

May possibly have had involvement in the 2007 "[[murder|suicide]]" of celebrity photo and sextape broker David Hans Schmidt. To prevent him from releasing photos of his "[[slave|wife]]" and hypno-slave Katie Holmes attaching, and removing a prosthetic latex "beach ball" pregnancy bump. Meaning that she staged her pregnancy, and Suri is adopted. Schmidt also possessed photos of Tom Cruise engaging in Satanic rituals, such as animal and blood sacrifice, along side David Miscavige. NOTE (L. Ron Hubbard was a satanist, and when you become a Scieno executive, you must involve yourself in satanism.)

Tom Cruise may also have been the celebrity that avant-gard director Kenneth Anger was referring to when talking in an interview about a star who got his foot in the door by being a gay hustler. According to Anger, this still unknown person eventually had so much VD that pus would seep out of his cock and through his pants.

Is the Co$'s 2nd in command, next to David Miscavige. Meaning that he is fully aware of, and is likely participating in $cientology's criminal activities. e.g. murders, kidnappings, arsons, pet killings, burglaries, cutting of brake lines, etc. Which is what his "big secret" is. Which is why David Hans Schmidt had to die. Tom Cruise was introduced to Scientology by ex "[[slave|wife]]" Mimi Rogers. And then learned that he could hide his homosexuality, and the fact that he was beaten, raped, and molested as a child, behind the church.

He also invented the glass hammer, rubber nails and the piano key neck tie. Also carries around a [[shit|stool]] to stand on when changing Suri's shoes or washing the dishes. Prone to vertigo when walking up hill.

==Christ of Scientology==
In January 2007, Thomas or as his mum calls him John, is declared the new [[Christ]] of [[Scientology]], his mission, should he accept it, is to spread the word of [[bullshit|his faith]] throughout the world. Leader David [[Miscarriage|Miscavige]] believes that in the future, Cruise, 44, will be worshiped like Jesus for his work to raise awareness of the religion.

[[Scientology]] sources said 'Tom has been told he is Scientology’s Christ-like figure.' 'Like Christ, he’s been criticized for his views. But future generations will realize he was right.' Tom Cruise, as well as other major celebrities are targeted and selected to join Scientology to bring positive publicity to, and advertise the cult. And help more people join in and fall victim to the financial scam that could also cost you your life if you're not careful.

Toms mum said [[shortman|little]] John has always been a [[16-year-old girl|fantasist]] and [[16-year-old girl|gullible]] fool, why it wasn’t two months ago he came home with some ‘magic beans’.

[[Image:Tom_Cruise.jpg|thumb|Clearly sane.]]

In January 2008 a video was released onto the net which proves unequivocally that cruise IS bat shit insane. It has been posted, deleted then reposted on JewTube since its release, other sites (unafraid of Tom's Zionist lawyers) have posted it for your lulzing pleasure [http://defamer.com/344987/the-tom-cruise-indoctrination-video-scientologists-dont-want-you-to-see here].

==Selected Filmography==
===Days of Thunder===
A shitty film from the 80's where Tom met his second wife who is some brain surgeon, where he and some other douchebag repeatedly buttpoke each other and then drive around in [[ricers|racecars]]. He gets fired for being a prick and destroying two racecars at once after [[almost died|almost dying]] in a crash, pouts and [[emo|cuts]] himself for awhile, then comes back in the black Mountain Piss car. Crying ensues and the movie ends, often with the audience hanging themselves with VCR wires.

===Top Gun===
Quite possibly the [[ghey]]est movie in cinematic history. He made out with [[Val Kilmer]] a.k.a Iceman in the shower to cheat on his gay lover [[Retard|Goose]] for going behind his back and fucking [[whore|Meg Ryan]] and making a baby, and then cheating on him again with some [[dyke|butchdyke]] [[bitch]] commanding officer. The movie finally ends with shooting down some [[commies]] and causing another bitchy commanding officer to shit his pants in an air control tower.

It's Days of Thunder but with FIGHTER JETS!

===Legend===
In this movie, Cruise prances around a glittery forest being some kind of gay elf in his best [[Bosnian]] haircut, with a [[Peter Pan]] costume stolen from [[Michael Jackson]]. He battles the original [[Guy Fawkes]] in a red body suit for possession of the [[Dildo|One Dildo]], a powerful bestiality item made from a [[Unicorn_Orgy|unicorn horn]]. In the end he succeeds, and proceeds to [[surprise buttsecks]] the last living unicorn with it, which banishes [[emo|winter]] and brings back [[Rainbow blinkies|summer]]. A great movie!

===Magnolia===
If you have seen this movie you are gay or a women (multiple females fused to one body; ''see [[Scientology]]'') or both. In this movie Tom plays an asshole, but on purpose this time, and he says "Respect the [[cock]], and tame the [[cunt]]! Tame it!" Like Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut, the director of this movie, Paul "The One Who Does Not Direct Shitty Remakes Of Aliens" Anderson, who since did this one movie about milkshakes, basically made this movie to make Tom cry like a bitch at some point. Really, the only reason any good directors make Tom Cruise movies is to torture him somehow.

===Eyes Wide Shut===
An awesome movie, where lulz troll [[Genius|Stanley Kubrick]] deviously concocts a lengthy and batshit insane plot to keep pussywhipped Tom from fucking anybody for over two and a half hours. These hours pass like molasses, but especially lulzy and naked molasses. The movie took several years to film, and while Stanley Kubrick was known to be a perfectionist who did [[over 9000]] takes of every single shot, he mostly drew this particular movie's shooting schedule out because he wanted to watch Tom not get laid for at least 3 years. Then, in the punchline to his cruel joke on Tom, Stanley died. Tom probably still thinks this movie is [[serious business]], but then Tom thinks everything is serious business. The reason he laughs a lot for no reason is because he is letting out the lulz before they die of [[Ethiopia|undernourishment]] and/or [[AIDS]].

===War of The Worlds===
His rendition of his crazy Scientology fantasy stopping doomsday robots with birds. (Pretty Lame because everyone wants to see him die) The majority of the movie involves the audience wondering why he doesn't strangle the little bitch of a 'daughter' every time she screams about something.

===Collateral===
Actually a good film because he dies and the fact is, it is a very good depiction of what Tom Cruise is really like in real life - A homicidal maniac (moar like HOMO-cidal maniac, [[amirite]]?) with a gun. The only one worth watching. Warning there's a black person in the movie, dragging down the cool rating by [[over 9000]] percent.

===Mission Impossible Trilogy===
This is what gay people think Tom Cruise does in his normal daily life...but the movie remains the most popular by Tom Cruise fans. Essentially every movie is a ripoff of ''The Bourne Identity'' in the way that Tom Cruise used to be a [[Scientology|secret agent]] and now the [[Illuminati]] and possibly [[commies]] all want to kill him... Mix in some random explosions from the ''Bad Boys'' series and you have a ''Mission Impossible'' movie.

===The Outsiders===
One of Tom's few good movies, maybe because he isn't a total [[asshat]] in it, or because it makes fun of his big nose.

===[[bukkake|Vanilla Skies]]===
Tom Cruise's obligatory [[whiny]] [[emo|emoshit]] film about him being some rich dude who fucks some crazy blonde chick, Penelope Cruz, and then finally shows the limit of his sanity by escaping from a prison and screaming "TECH SUPPOOOORRRRRRRRT!" Then Neo kicks him out of the Matrix and the movie ends about 2 and a half hours later than it should have.

===The Last Samurai===
[[Image:Valkyrie-02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cruise plays a [[Nazi]] in Valkyrie.]]
AKA ''[[Weeaboo]]: The First Wapanese''. This is the shittest movie ever. The fact that Tom Cruise is [[white]] and trying to fit in with a group of [[AZN]]s can lead to a pretty fucking [[gay]] storyline. It's almost worth it because he gets the shit beat out of him every 20 minutes. Don't bother watching this bowl of badly-fermented ''natto''; Richard Chamberlain (another closeted homo actor) served up a better dish of the whole gaijin-trapped-in-a-world-he-never-made shtick better 27 years ago in ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080274/ Shogun]'' anyway — and with the delicious Yôko Shimada as dessert.

===black person Report===
Tom Cruise plays the cop who [[baw|lost his son]] and then is hell bent on finding teh killa, however it is the future and these naked [[amazing atheist|inbred autistic fucktards]] are used by teh government to see the future, but unfortunately they can only see future murders. The movie goes on forever and is super gay, and that's without seeing Tom Cruise. So anyway turns out the old man that you think is his friend did it for the lulz all along. The whole subplot is this pseudo-intellectual bullshit about time paradoxes which is blatantly obvious the moment you think the word future but is explained in a way so that even some bricky tard can understand it.

===Tropic Thunder===
In this weird yet lulzy film about filming a film, some shitty actors getting kidnapped [[Maddy|Maddy style]] out in teh jungle, including Iron Man as a black person, [[Fat|Jack Black]] as Jack Black, another black person as [[Truth|himself]], and this other guy nobody gives a shit about, Tom Cruise plays [[capitalist|a rich, balding fat guy]] called Les Grossman (a portrayal of himself). Grossman is a raging faggot with a love for <s>money</s> cocks that is funding the film and goes batshit insane when Steve Coogan [[doing it wrong|fucks it up]] . Cruise is noted for his performance in this film by making himself look like an even bigger dipshit than he already is, this is because in a scene with a curly guy called Pecker (I KNOW LOL) he dances like a proverbial twat to the song "Low" by [[Nigra|Niggers]] (If you can find a video, you win ten internets because Cruise is constantly raeping the shit out of [[Jewtube]]).

===Valkyrie===
In this autobiographical Oliver Stone biopic about Cruise's life in the ranks of the Nazi army, the audience is taken back to when times were simpler, when eyepatches were still in style, and when the Jew problem was being handled. "A tour de Force performance!" say Ebert and [[Raep]]er. In the film, Tom's journey from latently [[ghey|homosexual]] fighter pilot to batshit crazy Scientologist nigger-lover is chronological in a style mirroring that of The Godfather Part II or Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties. This movie was met with both critical and public acclaim and will win the hearts of viewers young and old. '''SPOILER ALERT''': Cruise [[fail]]s it, but makes a really entertaining movie that's a [[propaganda]] film within itself. He speaks [[German]] briefly, and dreams of killing [[Hitler]]. Only to find bad acting fucks up everything. ZING LORD [[Xenu]] +2.
