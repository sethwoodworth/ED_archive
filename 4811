Les Six

'''Les Six''' is not, as the name suggests, a [[Xiao-Feng-Fury|disease]] affecting only [[Suicide Girls|female homosexualists]], but a term given [[last Thursday]] by the game company [[Eidos]] to a group of website owners who slavishly supported the [[Tomb Raider]] marketing department [http://www.tombraider.com/] whilst suppressing all unofficial viewpoints, especially ones involving [[Tomb Raider | Nude Raider]] and [[subtext|buttsecks]].

==Tomb Raider Number Ones==
Les Six were named in the game credits of [http://www.tombraideranniversary.com/asset_news.asp Tomb Raider: Anniversary], a remake of the remake of the original Tomb Raider game which was re-created by Crystal Dynamics to try and make [[money]] with no extra effort.

==They are==
* Kitty Flamingo
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pidgeon Walter "Chris" Pidgeon]
* [[NAMBLA]][http://youtube.com/watch?v=0mtajDn4Z3Y]
*[[David Icke]]
* [http://www.ivanafukalot.com Ivana Fukalot]
*[http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,275266/ Justin J. Farr] ([[Batman |secret identity]] tlr_online)

The list is of [[scat | sociological]] interest as it contains at least one [[pedophile |peadophile]], two [[Nazis]] and five [[attention whores]]. In unrelated news, it has been established by [[science]] that the use of a middle initial is a well known sign of being [[gay]].

==The fall of Les Six==
NAMBLA resigned as soon as possible to avoid being associated with such a bunch of [[nerds | upstanding citizens]]. [http://pli.planetlara.com/ Walter Pidgeon] had his eyes scratched out by Justin J. Farr, the moderator of the Tomb Raider Chronicles [http://www.tombraiderforums.com forum], who has as a result become [[attention whore|Queen]] of the [[Tomb Raider|World]] and his continual visits to [[Ron Gilbert | Eidos]] headquarters in [[Londonistan | Wimbledon]] to whine like a [[pussy]] about other webmasters beating him to “[[Barbie|Tomb Raider]] Exclusives” is a source of [[goatse | joy]] to everybody. Tom Wanksuc and Dan Beaver have mildly amusing surnames, whilst Shalamar Imanenov was cremated at [[Auschwitz]]. Only [[Mary Sue|Kitty Flamingo]] is still present in her earthly body delighting the [[ginger | special needs]] section of the [[jews|community]] with her “[[fan fiction |Lara Croft]]’s Tales of the Expected”.

==Not Les Six==
Not to be confused with an article “Les Six” in [[Uncyclopedia | Wikipedia]]  - “''a name, inspired by The Five, given in 1923 by critic Henri Collet in an article titled ‘Les cinq russes, les six français et M. Satie’ (Comoedia, 16 January 1920) to a group of six composers working in Montparnasse whose music is often seen as a reaction against Wagnerism and Impressionism.''” Which is quite [[TL;DR]] and not of the profoundly artistic historical significance as the fandom of [[Tomb Raider]].<br>

==In Legal News==
tlr_online is suing the [[Internet | Interweb]] over some [[serious business]] as he is a [[feminazi | no-nuts Rules Nazi]] who hides behind his [[Jesus | powers]] in order to silence and [[ban]] anybody he doesn't like. He is the epitome of [[win]] [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/images/9/95/JustinSpeaks.gif][http://www.tombraiderchronicles.com/headlines3269.html].<br><br>

==This site is literally un[[troll]]able!==

A 24 hour guard by [[nazi|Mods]] implements immediate account deletion and blockage of the IPs of any [[troll]] and all their posts are instantly (within about a minute) [[banhammer|deleted]]. This makes Tomb Raider Forums the first ever <b><u>totally troll proof discussion forum</u></b>. Unfortunately the constant banning of new members and gradually cutting off of the IPs of the rest of the globe means that TRF's Alexa rating is dropping like a stone and "The Earth's Biggest Tomb Raider Discussion Forum" ([[Unwarranted Self Importance|self-proclaimed]]) is not longer in the top 100,000. But at least they are [[gay|pure]] and protected from [[lulz|anarchy]]! Talks are proceeded with [[China]] and [[Australia]] to pass on this new [[communist|Total Control Of The Internets]] (TM) technique.

As have said on many occasions there are many subgames, addons etc that are not included in the official numbers of the main games. TR anniversary as much as in your mind is another game IS still the same story as TR1 therefore doesnt count as a separate title in the TR universe. So any possible upcoming main game featuring a certain Ms Croft would be the 9th story, NOT the 10th.}}<br>

[[gay|Somebody]] didn't like the [[true|this article]] and sent the [[13 year old boy|Death Star]] to try and [[goatse|blast]] it into [[oblivion]] ...  only to be [[retard|befuddled]] by [[MysteryBot]].

[[Image:TRFrage!.jpg|center|thumb|600px|MysteryBot is a mystery]]

Let's examine the evidence - i.e. the uploaded file "Image: Ostercy.jpg".

*[[shit nobody cares about|"Ostercy" created this page]] (whomever he/she/[[bot|it]] may be) in the year of [[Raptor jesus|Our Lord]] [[old|1853]].
*The uploaded picture is of a [[gay]] character from [[gay]] [[British]] sci-fi [[My Little Pony|Torchwood]], [[fellatio|beloved]] of [[gay|Britfags]].

Therefore the [[butthurt]] [[gay|individual]] ("[[I see what you did there|OstercyFarker]]" - [[fail|cool]] name) is [[gay]] and [[england|British]] and has a [[anal|hurt butt]], as well as being a bit of a [[asspie|moron]] ('''[[unwarranted self importance|delete everything!!!]]''' does not work at [[ED]], unlike at Tomb Raider Forums).





===Crack in the Armour for January 2009===

{{squote|If you want to setup a poll in the forum you can ask. We don't support external petitions, etc. aktrekker, moderator.}}

Classic lulz. One of the unfortunate Tomb Raider Forums [[12 year old girl|poster]]s set up a poll on ''an external site'' [http://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?t=163545&page=5], a move greeted with enthusiasm by the other members. The poster, who has an [[batshit insane|idea]] - like the other members of Tomb Raider Forums - that the developers of [[Tomb Raider]] [[unwarranted self importance|pay attention to what is written there]], innocently suggested that "if you guys want I can send the results to Jay/Keir" (at [[Eidos|$queedo$h]]). However. Then it was noticed by the "[[china|Administration]]" that there was room for comments on the poll, ''comments that could not be deleted by the Forum Mods''. Oh dear. The [[anger|slightly sarcastic]] [[troll|comments]] about Tomb Raider Forums started to flood in from the [[one|hundreds]] of banned ex-members. Result - [[habbo|poll's closed]].
