Gosu

The word GOSU (pronounced like '''GO-SUE!''') is actually a [[Korea]]n-term for [[Shit nobody cares about|unbelievable skillz in geek-games]] which are not played by anyone at the moment except for some nerds.

[[Lie|Rumors]] say that Gosu translates to "The High Hand".  Another accepted term by the community is "Good or skilled user". But this term definitely underrates the power of a GOSU.
Some people say that GOSUs are sent by [[god]] to keep justice in our world. But they seem to use their uber-skills given from god to [[Pwn|r0ck n00bs]] in [[Gaming|computer games]].
