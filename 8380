Thinspiration
[[image:youtubethinspiration.jpg|center]]

'''Thinspiration''' is the term used by [[eating disorder|anorexic]] members of [[pro-ana]] communities for a particular thin or anorexic celebrity who serves as a role model. It is often a required field in applications to closed pro-ana communities, and applicants may be rejected on the basis of having thinspirations which are too clich√©d (see also: [[Mary-Kate Olsen]]), too [[ugly]], or too [[fat]]. There are various [[LiveJournal]] communities full of 13- to 18-year-old teenage girls who frequent themselves as thinspiring. "OMG , i'm sew fat, i need 2 look @ more pix of MK." This is insane in the same sort of way as [[Nazi mysticism]].

== Goals of Thinspiration ==  

The point of Thinspiration is to end up looking like a [[Holocaust]] survivor. Thinspiration can help [[YOU]] achieve this lofty goal!

* Step 1. Realize you are a [[fatty]] [[BBW|fat]] [[furry|fat]]. 
* Step 2. Google Image the name of a waif.
** '''Examples''': Kate Hudson, Uma Thuman, Mary Kate Olson (the one who smokes [[crack]], not the other one), etc.
* Step 3. Obsess over some pic. Print it out, paste it on your walls and masturbate on top of it while crying.
* Step 4. Purge.
* Step 5. Return to Step 1 and repeat daily.

A good way to stick to your daily picture looking/[[vomiting]] routine is by posting stats of your daily weight loss online. See:
* {{ljcomm|mk_and_ana}}
* {{ljcomm|proanorexia}}
* {{ljcomm|_thinspire}}
* {{ljcomm|pro_si}}

Sometimes, anafags like to cross over to [[cutting]] and [[self-injury]]. This makes them worth twice the lulz and is typical of [[attention whore]] behavior. The considerate anorexic will provide lulz to the world by posting his or her pix on [[Psyke.org]].
