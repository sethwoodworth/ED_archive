Michael Lynn
'''Michael Lynn''' chews with his mouth open like a [[W|monkey]]. It is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen, and frankly, I am sick of it. ISS didn't fire him for [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] vuln disclosures; [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|they fired him because he was a prima donna]] and a massive [[Asperger's_syndrome|asspie]] who never really got any work done. Props to David Maynor of ISS for being instrumental in this idiot's firing (now if only Brian Mitchell would get the axe). I will never buy a Juniper product ever now that they have hired this quasi-retarded, emotionally stunted little prick.

== Guide to losing your job ==
Follow this simple guide if you want to receive a [[permaban]] from your [[job|place of employment]]:
*Research security exploits for a hardware company
*Write a speech about the security exploits for presentation to a bunch of computer geeks
*Get a warning about not presenting the speech or else you are going to get in deep shit
*Present it anyway
*????
*PROFIT

== Apple security efforts ==

Jealous of [[Lance M. Havok]], Michael attempted to create a solution to all [[Apple]] security problems:

It obviously doesn't work like anything Mike does, but you can dare it will [[fuck]] your [[crap|Mac computer]].
