'''Sinistar''' refers to both some 8-bit 80's ''twitch'' arcade game, and the boss of said game of the same name. 

Sinistar also refers to a script written by [[Moot]] sometime in February 2008.  Moot made a [[sticky]] on [[b|/b/]], and with the script, made it so that "Sinistar" would appear to burst out the page.  Sinistar would then fly around the web page spouting a variety of sayings.  Unfortunately for Moot, the script was made of fail, since everyone on the [[internets]] uses [[java|AdBlock and NoScript]], ensuring that [[noone]] ever rapes their [[internets|intertubes]] with Sinistar.  [[Evar]].
