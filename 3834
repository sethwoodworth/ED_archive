I'm back faggots
On June 8, 2010, everything was going well on [[4chan]]'s boards, specifically [[b|the one where the most wholesome, intellectual discussions take place]]. However, at about 7:00 CST, an [[underage b&]] decided he would have some fun and troll. Instead of posting only once or twice, he posted throughout the thread, even though it had already been declared that he was a [[troll]]. [[btards|/b/tards]], being the intelligent creatures they are, decided that instead of not feeding the obvious troll, they would feed it. 

Eventually, his supposed "IRL girlfriend OMG" was found [http://www.facebook.com/#!/profile.php?id=1595325043&ref=ts on Failbook]. In the end, some /b/tard decided it would be a good idea to make an ED article on this underage b& faggot, probably out of rage or jealousy of the OP's JAPANESE BLADEMASTER SKILLZ0RZ.

==The story==

[[OP]] is an [[faggot|epic blademaster]] who returned from [[Japan]] for his [[wapanese|blademaster]] training and is now back with a [[retard|vengance]]. Also, he has a [[camwhore|hot girlfriend]] as well as a father who is a [[fag|cop]], and did I forget to mention that he is also in a [[mantrain|gang]] despite being the son of a cop? He proceeded to continue posting, engaging in a rather lulzy argument with someone named [[btard|Justin L Brown]], who had an equally lulzy response waiting at every turn.

The original thread has disappeared into the vast [[404]] of /b/, but it's expected that the tardlette will return.
