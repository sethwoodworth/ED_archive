[[Suicide]]. [[Terrorism]]. [[Death]] [[flame war|threats]]. [[Genocide]]. [[Harassment]]. [[identity theft|Larceny]]. [[Evil|Nigras]]. Welcome to '''EBAUMSWORLD.COM''' otherwise known as the [[Oregon Tea Party]].

[[Serious Fucking Business|All-pervasive and insidious]], at the bleakest, semen-stained heart of the internet lies eBaum's World, the Agent Smith of the [[Matrix]] which stamps the [[watermark]] of [[Satan|the beast]] upon everything [[virgin|pure]] and ruins lives, one life-shattering [[raid]] at a time. Cyber-insurgents swearing [[fellatio|fealty]] to their fell chieftain Eric Bauman, in collusion with the [[Jews]] and the [[china|Republic of Chinkdom]], have covered the whole of the internets with [[bot]]s, [[CSIII|hackers]], [[internet police|virtual pigs]], and [[children]]-seeking robotic [[centipedes]] that hunt down your [[pictures]] and [[dox]] to distribute to recently paroled [[Brian Peppers|serial rapists]] and [[User:OldDirtyBtard|militant jihadists]].

That [[gay]] [[porn]] your [[Masturbation|girlfriend]] found on your [[MySpace]]? That [[cracker]] wearing a cheap Afro wig who announced that [[The_Great_Deathly_Hallows_IRL_Raid_of_2007|VOLDEMORT KILLS SNAPE]] in the bookstore, which caused your [[loli|tween]] daughter to drown herself in her bubble bath? Those dirty Negroes that annually interrupt your pathetic attempts to get your hands on sum [[JB]] in [[Habbo]]? All from eBaum's World, under the command of Mr. Bauman himself, who takes breaks from having [[buttsecks]] with [[13 year old boy]]s on his [[black|ebony]] throne in the heart of [[Pol Pot|Cambodia]] to [[troll]] [[America]]n high-schools so he can drink the sweet and salty [[Cracky-chan|menstrual blood]] of [[Prussian Blue|blonde, blue-eyed teenage girls]].

Even as [[you]] read this, eBaum's World is planning the destruction of [[over 9,000]] different targets worldwide with their ability to [[Fox News|explode vans]] of all kinds with cyber-[[telekinesis]]. [[Some argue]] that they have the ability to access any page on the tubes at any time, with a single keystroke. They routinely [[masturbate]] to [[CP|naked pictures of your children]] that they took using your own digital camera. [[Noone]] is safe.

On a lighter note, all raids performed by any sect of Anonymous is automatically the work of eBaum's World. [[Rule 34|No exceptions.]]

==Crimes against the [[Internets]]==

[[Image:Ebaumhabbo.jpg|thumb|Proof]]

eBaum's World spies are everywhere, even our precious [[ED]] fatherland. Terrible edits and [[article]]s full of [[lie|disinformation]] and propaganda are made every day, placing the blame upon [[anonymous]] for their terror campaign.

Aside from [[Catnarok|their relentless war on everything]], eBaum's World is the miserable black market of the internet; [[backmasking|everything there]] is stolen, and some [[Bigboxbear|fat smelly guy]] is trying to make money with it before he gets caught. In this case, the toothless scalper is an evil conspiring Jew going by the name "eBaum", which is the [[internet]] spelling of "[[Leeching|Eric Bauman]]". In numerous cases he has been caught doing such things as cropping watermarks out of [[image macro]]s, decompiling [[flash]] movies, and recompressing [[shit]]ty mpg files all in order to rebrand them with his own tag, which is slowly poisoning the rest of the internet.

No matter what you do, nothing will convince eBaum to remove your work from his shitty website. Occasionally [[old media]] giants will find some of their [[copyright]]ed material on his servers and issue a [[DMCA]] takedown notice, which eBaum then shreds, rolls up in a hundred dollar bill, and smokes while laughing hysterically. His millions in ad revenue have made him virtually untouchable in the virtual world and nothing short of [[death|IRL death]] will make any difference.

==eBaum vs. [[Something Awful]]==
As previously noted, ''everything'' "hosted" on eBaum's World was created elsewhere, usually humor sites like [[Fark]], [[Something Awful]], [[4chan]], [[Albino Black Sheep]], [[Newgrounds]],  [[YTMND]], or even [[LiveJournal]]. It has been theorized that eBaum has even stolen old content from himself, which of course was previously stolen. Upon noticing a recent update featuring a years-old [[Something_Awful#Comedy_Goldmine|comedy goldmine]], [[goons]] organized a massive [[rape|forum invasion]] and brought parts of eBaum's World to its knees by repeatedly [[spam]]ming [[catchphrases]] and complaining about eBaum's lack of a [[penis|conscience]]. In retaliation, eBaum inserted a snippet of code into every page on his site that requested files from Something Awful's servers. This brought the forums down for five minutes until Radium, the admin who sleeps with SA's servers, returned and changed some file and ended the sloppy [[denial of service]] attack that eBaum had begun.

[[Goons]] Altf4 and Trapezoid decided that, as 80's children's cartoons had taught them, they could help change their shitty little slice of the internet world through the power of [[gay|song]]. What they came up with sounds like a cross between hair metal and a hobo breaking into a piano convention, and the accompanying flash animation is more like an [[MS Paint]] slideshow. Angry [[goons]] and other eBaum's enemies, however, ate the entire thing up.

After a while, eBaum decided he would no longer tolerate the existence of [http://www.ebaumsworldsucks.com ebaumsworldsucks.com] and threatened the owners, saying "I'm going to own this domain in 72 hours either way bro," ([[sic]]). The SA goons promptly laughed. eBaum then got in contact with AltF4, the creator of the flash, pleading with him to take it down. The SA goons, after they finished jerking each other off, then started a LiveJournal community, {{ljcomm|ebaumsucks}}, which is currently trying to make a list of everything that eBaum has stolen. The chatlog can be read [http://www.elohtibbar.com/ebombchat.txt here].

The site now lies in purgatory, as everyone realized that protesting eBaum's thievery is like holding a rally against bad traffic: everybody hates it, but it's too prevalent to destroy.

==eBaum vs [[YTMND]]==
In January of 2006, the powers that be at eBaum's World lifted an image from a user at YTMND. In the late hours of Saturday, January 7th, irate YTMND users [http://ebaumsraid.ytmnsfw.com/ launched an attack] against the eBaum's World forums. [[Something Awful]] [http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=1767622&perpage=40&pagenumber=8], [[Fark]], [[4chan]], LUELinks, [[Gaia Online]], ''VG Cats'', [http://www.genmay.com/ Gen[M<nowiki>]</nowiki>ay] and even [[Wikipedia]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebaum%27s_world#Controversy] were used to get the message out: [[Internet drama|war]] [[All your base are belong to us|was beginning!]]

eBaum's World barred its doors to new forum users, and the [[n00bs]] began to use .bat files with ping commands to [[Denial of Service|DoS]] eBaum's World in an attempt to bring it down. This attack barely dented the bandwidth usage at eBaum's World - a site that encourages hotlinking to their stolen [[image macro]]s as its main form of advertising.

The YTMND webmaster, Jew, posted an [http://ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=13 announcement] on the main page strictly forbidding sites about [[Denial of Service|DDoS]]. This seriously impaired the internets [[Jihad]] against eBaum's World, as their main source of getting the message across was blocked. This didn't stop enraged YTMND fans from fighting back, though, as they crafted a cunning script that [http://www.freewebs.com/ibonk constantly downloads and refreshes] the stolen Lindsay Lohan image from eBaum's server.

After Bauman sent two [http://baumanletters.ytmnd.com/ "cease and desist"] emails, containing poor grammar and even a "[[LOL]]", max finally had enough. He posted a hilarious and witty [http://maxrocksmysocks.ytmnd.com/ email] that totally pwned eBaum's World in general. Also, the original YTMND user that created the original Lohan image started sending cease and desist letters to eBaum's World. It was enough, and eBaum's World finally admitted defeat by [http://wewon.ytmnd.com/ removing] the Lohan image. Since max keeps his word he's keeping his part of the deal and he's going to delete every site that has "eBaum" in the title at midnight. But not that he'd delete every eBaum site, just the ones with "eBaum" in the title. [[ALL CAPS|THIS IS TRUE LUNACY!]]

That second week of January, 2006 will long be remembered as the day that the most [[gay|limp-wristed]] [[forum]] [[war]] in history was fought and won, by YTMND's [[drugs|cracked-out]] users.  It will also be remembered as a day when eBaum's World finally was humiliated for being [[Wikipedia|a website full of hacks]].

==eBaum's World vs. [[Newgrounds]]==
Hating eBaum is somewhat of a fad on the Newgrounds forums. If you even MENTION Bauman, you will get flamed, assraped, banned, tied down and beaten senseless with bansticks, and banned and assraped again. This fad started when a random [[n00b]] found a tacky [[flash]] on eBaum's World, and said, "Hey! I saw something like this on [[Newgrounds]]!" So he made a shitty thread about it, and thus started the anti-Bauman phase. No one really talks about it much any more but once in a while some [[faggot|faggette]] will bring it up.

==eBaum's World vs. SomaForum==
SomaForum is a spin-off of eBaum's World created by a few butthurt users who hated the eBaum's mods. Some eBaum's users spammed SomaForum with shock images and porn, but after a while everyone realized that a shitty spin-off of a shitty site wasn't even close to being worth the trouble.

==eBaum's World vs. [[Fredryk Phox]]==
Bauman saw short video clips of Fredryk Phox acting like a moron somewhere and hit him up for an eBaum's exclusive video. Fredryk, never having heard of eBaum's World before, agreed and branded a compilation of his random video clips and sent it to Bauman. Bauman then rewarded this kind gesture by continuing to put Fredryk Phox videos and other contents on his site. Fredryk retaliated by making a series of videos, beginning with [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yvXaCPRNLg ''The Eric Bauman Story''].

==7chan vs. eBaum vs. 7chan again==
On Saturday, January 13, 7chan, in retaliation for Bauman's theft of one of the pathetic motivational posters that get posted every day in about 6 different threads, raided eBaum's, using vampire scripts and wget raids to yank images off of the server repeatedly. In "retaliation", the next day eBaum's tried to flood 7chan's /34/, /b/, /i/, /a/, /ani/, /art/, /cat/, /fit/, /g/, and /fur/. Unfortunately for eBaum's, raiding a *chan is like [[Trolls Trolling Trolls|pissing in an ocean of piss]]. People looked, laughed, and then planned the next raid.

==Stealing from Cracked.com==
[[Image:Waynes world.jpg|thumb|Wayne's World is awesome. eBum's World is not.]]
On Wednesday September 25, 2007, [http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/view/39034/ an article] appeared on ebaumsworld.com named [[Suicide|''Internet Safety Tips'']], almost identical to Cracked.com's unfunny article of the [http://www.cracked.com/index.php?name=News&sid=1720 same name]. Is this actual theft, or did the original creator of the article's images [[whore|open his loins wide to eBaum's money dick?]] In the end, [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody gives a shit]].

==eBaum's Host Company Shuts Down==
ZVUE, the owner of eBaum's World, is shutting down all of their offices [http://blog.ebaum.tv/2009/01/welcome.html]. The economy does its best work since Circuit City got liquidated.

==eBaum moves to ebaumnation.com, formerly known as [[It's a trap|ebaum.tv]]==
After eBaum himself got the shit kicked out of him by the people who bought his horrible excuse for a company, he moved on to have his new website, ebaum.tv. He then decided he no longer liked that url so he changed it to ebaumnation.com

Don't even bother going there, as the quality of the content still manages to maintain its reputation for complete shittiness.

==eBaum's World and Whatup TV==
In December of 2010, a website called [http://www.whatup.tv Whatup TV] emerged with a meta troll-based business model of stealing content exclusively from Ebaumsworld.com to parody its practices. Upon being [http://forum.ebaumnation.com/showthread.php?56531-How-do-you-explain-yourself-out-of-this-one&highlight=whatup.tv discovered], Whatup TV responded by replacing all Ebaumsworld videos with [http://www.google.com/search?&q=fat+man+shoots+gun ebaumsworld.flv], but leaving the thumbnails intact. This additional trolling fell on deaf ears, however, as the content of "Fat Man Shoots Gun" is spiritually, allegorically and literally equivalent to the content of all Ebaumsworld videos anyway, and Ebaumsworld users couldn't tell that anything had been replaced.
