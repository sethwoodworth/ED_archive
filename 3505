[[Shit nobody cares about|Grues originated in Zork, a text-only adventure game that was released]] [[at least 100 years ago]]. It has become a typically [[shitty]] [[Uncyclopedia]]n [[meme]] that hardly scores a positive reading on the [[lulz]]ometer. On average, an [[Uncyclopedia]] article is linked to <nowiki>[[Grue]]</nowiki> [[at least 100]] times BUT of course it never, [[evar]] gets [[Funny|stale]].

In accordance with the [[retard|average Uncyclopedian's]] [[aspie|sense of humor]] and their standard array of [[furry|sick]] [[Vore|fetishes]], grues are thought to eat nothing but [[penis|human flesh]].

If [[you]] ever see a Grue [[IRL]], then it's [[Serious Fucking Business]]!!![[oneoneone]]!1! [[You]] are either...
