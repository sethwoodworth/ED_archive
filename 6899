Red Shirt Guy
__NOTOC__
{{spoiler|Falstad Wildhammer survived and in fact was the leader of Aerie Peak in vanilla WoW through Wrath of the Lich King}}
<br />
When one thinks of the world's greatest works of fiction, inevitably the classic ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' comes to mind. This beautifully crafted and intricate universe is deeply intertwined with our own, portraying societal issues like conjuring water from the ground, or killing [[Jews|wrinkly, short monsters with huge noses that carry gold with them]]. Cue WoW novice-researcher and Falstad Wildhammer's (if you don't know who that is you need to go read a [[book]] you ignorant fuck) number-one fan, '''Red Shirt Guy'''. 

The story begins innocently enough at Blizzcon 2010 (think E3 but for even fatter and sweatier neckbeards), when our hero dares to challenge the glorious lore of ''World of Warcraft''. When others simply dismissed the apparent loss of the great Falstad Wildhammer as his inevitable fate, a young WoW fan decided to ask the tough questions. He slowly approached the microphone to finally settle the fate of his hero Mr. Wildhammer with the panel participants, apparent creators of this universe.

This massive plot hole was, no doubt, extremely embarrassing for the company. In a desperate attempt to avoid public ridicule (not to mention an exponential decline in share-value), the designers tried to gloss over their crippling humiliation by sarcastically thanking Red Shirt Guy and giving assurances that they would fix the incongruity. On the following day - when news of the event, predictably, went viral - [[Wet dream|share value plummeted, the company declared bankruptcy and Blizzard's entire staff got shitcanned]].

==Who is our mysterious hero?==
In the aftermath of this debacle, Red Shirt Guy decided to give the world his version of events, and stunned onlookers with the revelation that he has [[Ass_Burgers|Asperger's]]. ...And not a single fuck was given that day.

==Blizzard responds==
Blizzard has responded by immortalizing Red Shirt Guy within the game universe. He is now an NPC known as Wildhammer Fact Checker. A developer recently confirmed it on the [http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=27509091494&sid=1&pageNo=2 WoW forums.]
