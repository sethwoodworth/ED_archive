Jodie Gater and Stephanie Gestier
{{an hero}}

[[Image:TimeToGoJodieGaterStephanieGestier.jpg|thumb|Jodie and Stephanie's [[IRL|last]] [[permaban|moments]]. Is it just me or do they look disturbingly like [[Tatu]]?]]

'''Jodie Gater and Stephanie Gestier''', were two [[homosexual]] lovers and incredibly terrible [[16 year old girl|16-year-old]] musicians who were students at Melbourne's Upwey High School. They were missing for a week before their maggoty decomposing bodies were found on Sunday the 22 of April 2007, hanging from a tree in the [[LOLDONGS|Dandenong]] Ranges National Park and thus [[quit IRL]] becoming [[an hero|an heroes]]. It is possible that they died on [[an hero day]] but probably died MUCH earlier if the gut-wrenching stench emanating from their bodies is any indication.
Apparently both girls hugged each other like lesbians, thought "what the hell" and held hands, probably to make people think were dykes, which they probably were, which may have been another reason for the suicide.

==I blame... THE INTERNETS!==
	 
As in the case of every suicide it is never the responsibility of family or friends to make sure their [[16 year old girl]] doesn't want to hang herself from a tree. In this case the [[internets]] are to blame and even the [[Ruddkipz|Prime Minister of Australia]] has been questioned on the matter. It is assumed that because the girls spent hours chatting on the internets and posting horrible things there this made them want to die. As newspapers always tell the truth, it is expected that EVERY editor of [[ED]] will soon be swinging from a tree like a black person in [[lynch]]ing season. The suicides triggered a $5.9 billion investigation of MySpace.com which yielded no other suicide threats.

==I blame... EMOS!==

Newspapers across [[Australia]] went on a blaming rampage firstly with the [[internets]] then with the [[emo]] culture. There is, however, evidence that Stephanie wasn't even an emo, just a retarded [[16 year old girl]] following [[morrissey|fashion trends]].

[http://vampirefreaks.com/italktoRAINBOWS Steph's now deleted Vampire Freaks page], (attained via the Wayback machine) states what her favorite bands were. Ummm...like what <s>emo</s> sane human would admit to liking [[Paris Hilton]] and [[weeaboo|Gwen Stefani]]? Fucking none. In conclusion the [[media]] is fucking retarded.

==The warning signs their friends and family ignored==

It is not known how the family and friends of these noble [[an hero]]es were so stupid as to miss the blatantly obvious warning signs of their imminent suicide, or maybe they just didn't give a shit. The latter is the most probable scenario. It is highly likely that if the two miserable bitches had run down the street naked screaming "I AM THE ANTICHRIST! I WILL MEET MY DARK SAVIOR TONIGHT WHEN I FUCKING KILL MYSELF!" their [[retard]]ed so called friends would not have noticed.

Jodie's friends didn't seem to care, either that or they were too stupid to realize what was going on, which isn't that hard to believe.

==Internets Phail Site==

A tribute site popped up to commemorate Stephanie Gestier's death, but not Jodie Gater's death as nobody liked her anyway apparently. [http://stephanie-gestier.gonetoosoon.co.uk/ This site is what happens when you feel guilty about letting your friend die alone]. After [[/b/]] was notified of its existence the site was promptly trolled into the ground and deleted. OMG NEVAR FORGET!111
