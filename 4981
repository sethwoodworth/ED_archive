'''Louis "Louie" CK''' is a [[jewish]] [[Mexican]] [[ginger]] comedian and moderately [[successful troll]] that [[noone]] has [[evar]] [[mudkip|herd]] of, save for his short-lived HBO sitcom, [http://www.hbo.com/luckylouie/ "Lucky Louie"], in which he co-starred with his [[Opie_and_Anthony#THEY'VE GOT NORTON!|fellow Opie & Anthony alum Jim Norton]]. [[Mundane|Lulzy]] as it was, it nonetheless generated a small measure of [[drama]] once in a while. Despite having moar [[lulz]] than [[at least 100|almost all]] other TV [[shit]]coms, it was [[an hero|cancelled]] [[at least 100|a few years ago]] due to [[butthurt]] from corporate execs who deemed its content "too [[racist|racy]] and [[offensive]]" for their [[fellatio|tastes]].

In addition to this, he has [[shameless self promotion|directed/written for numerous movies]], as well as for fellow [[ginger]] Conan O'Brien. As a matter of fact, he has been on Conan's [[dick|couch]] [[at least 100|countless]] times.

Louie has been ripped off more than once by moar famous, yet less talented comedians. Along with [[over 9000|many]] other comics, he had his material Xerox'd by [[Dane Cook]]. Despite this [[faggotry]], Louie was rather humble towards Cook in an [[anonymous]] [[radio]] interview, and only badmouthed Cook [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRcem3Nk17s&eurl after he was encouraged to by the host]. This disappointed many of his fans, who wished he would've [[kill it with fire|burned him at the stake]].

More recently, however, it turns out that yet ''another'' [[overrated]] comic has taken from Louie. [[Last Thursday|A few months ago]] on the [[Opie and Anthony]] radio show, he revealed that [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhxqnCyoGo&feature=related he was the original creator of the song, "I'm An Asshole"], and that [[Denis Leary]], taking a page out of the [[Dane Cook]] playbook, [[stole]] the bit from him and passed it off as his own. Note, however, that Leary's ''entire career'' has been built off of this kind of [[faggotry|fraudulence]].

Two months later, after being exposed as a hack, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g81LCwrU-7k&feature=related Leary went on the same show] and [[NO U|tried to discredit]] Louie's story with a much weaker one, revealing Leary as a massive [[douchebag]] once again.
