== Obsession(poetry on eating disorders) ==
by Megan Meier<br>
NOW ANNOTATED FOR RAPE

These poems are my reflections on being a teen with a deadly disease <br>
<br>
[[tl;dr|'''Long Dead''' <br>
From the pit of my stomach <br>
I throw up a diversion <br>
I make my excuses <br>
As I tip toe to my execution <br>
Begging for the shock <br>
Screaming for you to turn it up <br>
Its just not enough <br>
For these memories to be blocked '''([[raep]])'''<br> 
You cant comprehend <br>
Being pinned at the hands '''([[raep]])'''<br> 
With no way to defend '''([[raep]])'''<br> 
So, you close your eyes and pretend <br>
Float from your body and transcend <br>
You reach a place where you can remain <br>
Until he's done being entertained '''([[raep]])'''<br> 
Spend the rest of your years in fear '''([[raep]])'''<br>
Reliving each moment till you can no longer feel '''([[raep]])'''<br>
I've got a soul full of secrets '''([[raep]])'''<br>
And head full of memories '''([[raep]])'''<br>
Nightly replaying  '''([[raep]])'''<br>
Continuing to invade me  '''([[raep]])'''<br>
Until I'm down to nothing <br>
So, I'm chained to my innocence <br>
Hell bound to keep it <br>
Despite that it cant be resurrected  '''([[raep]])'''<br>
From the child who was never protected  '''([[raep]])'''<br>
And with my head in the toilet <br>
I purge till I can forget <br>
The jaded life I've lived '''([[raep]])'''<br>
<br>
'''Who I Need to Be''' <br>
I beg for clarity <br>
but food is all you bring me <br>
Behind your screen of calories <br>
I can see you laughing as you spoon feed <br>
Remove anything that's sharp <br>
To combat my peculiar need to self harm <br>
Ignore deep etchings of Hieroglyphics up and down my arms <br>
And cradle me like a little girl <br>
Till I no longer wish to open myself <br>
Rope me down like your cattle on a ranch <br>
Fingers carelessly flip the switch <br>
Increase the lightning and watch me twitch <br>
Body rises as the mind fries <br>
Erase my pain and memories of my early life <br>
If I say your prayers you'll let me free <br>
Bow to your God and never disagree <br>
Following your commandments is my only guarantee <br>
To ever be let out on my own two feet <br>
I swear its been defeated <br>
That I've moved on and fully compleated <br>
How I'm interested in eating <br>
And accept that a body is worth feeding <br>
Honest, I'm no longer obsessed with bleeding <br>
Your genius plan has succeeded <br>
And set me on a path to fulfilling my dreams <br>
Its all so wonderful, who wouldn't want to believe <br>
I keep my pain silent <br>
And my tendencies less violent <br>
Hide cuts with bracelets <br>
and layer clothes over ribs <br>
I've gotten so good at hiding it <br>
<br>
'''Reality''' <br>
Forgetting my name and the pains of life <br>
Take what they hand me, and don't ask why <br>
Drowning my day in the bottom of a bottle <br>
Making out with oh-whats-his-name in the corner <br>
Fighting my friends with blood shot eyes <br>
Turn my head as they painfully cry <br>
Straw to nose, I slowly die <br>
But it feels so good to be flying this high <br>
Cant bring me down from this place <br>
I've got a dime to cure and a life to erase <br>
Bury my past <br>
And say a prayer <br>
But threre's more to be done than your words can repair <br>
Just a wandering girl <br>
Who got thrust into the real world <br>
Try and break free <br>
But its so hard to stay clean <br>
When the earth becomes real at just fifteen <br>
<br>
'''Doubt''' <br>
Self doubt swallows me whole <br>
Life set on spin cycle <br>
Wash me up in waves <br>
Nightly digging my own grave <br>
Screaming to be saved <br>
Psych ward walls are padded <br>
I'm not comfortable in your delusions <br>
Jumbled lies only fuel my confusion <br>
Keep me close to your heart <br>
A token <br>
A favor of my dire sanity <br>
I could scream all night <br>
But I doubt you'd hear me <br>
<br>
'''Die''' <br>
Hold my chest <br>
Close my eyes <br>
Wonder if I'm going to die <br>
Call out in the dark of night <br>
I try and suppress it, but I cannot help but cry <br>
I've wasted my life <br>
So many pills I've misused <br>
A horror that even I cannot excuse <br>
My body has been broken and bruised <br>
I enjoyed the pain from my own abuse <br>
I'm a fucking fool... <br>
Live fast and die young <br>
I hate the girl I've become <br>
But this is the price I must pay <br>
For constantly obsessing on my weight <br>
My sick and tragic fate <br>
<br>
'''Family''' <br>
I was never a very good child <br>
I had devilish ideas behind my innocent smile <br>
Was much to arrogant and wise <br>
I grew up beyond my time <br>
My mother never really wanted me <br>
I was the last thing she needed <br>
Pregnancy her fucking disease <br>
The horror that made the anorexic eat <br>
What held her back from succeeding <br>
Daddy was to drunk to notice <br>
Beat my Mom to rid the stress <br>
Chugged his liquor to forget <br>
A wasted person with nothing left <br>
but a life full of regrets <br>
Their product of destruction <br>
That was raised by dysfunction <br>
Never got to be young <br>
but what's done is done <br>
and this is the chaos I've become.. <br>
<br>
'''Return''' <br>
I took my steps upon the path to recovery <br>
Vowing it a time of self discovery <br>
But I was the fool <br>
I cannot live without you <br>
A little secret you always knew <br>
Playing the part in meals <br>
I thought with time, Ana's scars would heal <br>
But it was another spell I had cast <br>
Screaming in the face of my tortured past <br>
A cheap trick to throw my friends off my starving path <br>
A whirl wind of numbers spinning all to fast <br>
I forgot how to breathe <br>
Gasping for air between my horrific screams <br>
Staring in the mirror at a girl who I could swear wasn't me <br>
That reflection stole my self-esteem <br>
I took back my voice for what seemed like an instant <br>
Tossing away my drugs and substances <br>
But I had no will for existence <br>
and so she fed off my resistance <br>
I've returned to my obsessive modes <br>
Locking my soul, dying alone <br>
Obsessing on bones <br>
Ana......I'm home <br>
<br>
'''Withered Idol''' <br>
Please don't idolize me <br>
No matter how many bones you can or cannot see <br>
Malnutrition consumes my frail body <br>
Caught in a whirl wind of tragedy <br>
Obsessing on each and every calorie <br>
Perpetually hungry <br>
Feeding off the pain <br>
Lips dripping with disdain <br>
A heap of tortured limbs, that the mind refuses to claim <br>
Racing time in such a hellish game <br>
Fading into a dimming light <br>
Finding shelter in the cold of night <br>
Soaking in my last lives sights <br>
I've got nothing left to hide <br>
Burn my flesh till it withers in a heap of black <br>
Tears will flow, but don't look back <br>
My faded smiles can bring your life's pain comfort no more <br>
Hold onto the joys that we had before <br>
A few stray roses for your baby girl <br>
<br>
'''Desperate Change''' <br>
Desperate <br>
Swallow what's left <br>
Choke on your guilt <br>
Addicted to pills <br>
Nothing but filth <br>
Wash it down with tonic <br>
Chased away with a puff of chronic <br>
Forget your name <br>
Its all a game <br>
Till you become its slave <br>
Die in your prison <br>
Dripping with crimson <br>
Body cannot save the mind <br>
The only cure is time <br>
Get off your addictions <br>
Figure out how to fix it <br>
You can't cure pain <br>
Change <br>
<br>
'''Fame''' <br>
She's having a love affair with fame <br>
Nightly, screaming out its name <br>
Dancing in its flickering flame <br>
She's got a flare for the dramatic <br>
Just a tad eccentric <br>
On trial for being to egocentric <br>
Her moves are all to slick <br>
She's such a cheap trick <br>
Dim the lights and huge the crowd, tonight's her debut <br>
Never avert your eyes, watch her every move <br>
Taking a bow, without a sound her lucious eyes thank you <br>
Treat the lady good and pay her what she's due <br>
Many favors she's prepared to do <br>
Seduction for your review <br>
She's having a love affair with fame <br>
Caught up in its entrancing game <br>
Burning in its flame <br>
<br>
'''Sleep''' <br>
My body's grown increasingly weak <br>
Falling into rhythms of a starving sleep <br>
I woke it up <br>
Only to choke <br>
On the bones of hope <br>
I fell back into these patterns <br>
Sewn by models in pages of gloss <br>
Urging me to keep up my psychotic weight loss <br>
Their words are law <br>
Echoing in my mind, ignoring my hunger withdrawals <br>
Be stronger than that which commands you <br>
Remember, its only food <br>
In truth you don't need it to survive <br>
It doesn't keep you alive <br>
Don't stray from your maestro <br>
Every time you consume, she knows <br>
Cant hide your sins <br>
You'll never be thin <br>
<br>
'''No one knows''' <br>
Desperate attempts to find who you are <br>
Run hands over scars <br>
Begging for tomorrow <br>
Thick blood <br>
You've had enough <br>
Heave up yourself <br>
Silent cries for help <br>
Demented mind <br>
Tortured by night <br>
Muffled cries in the dawning light <br>
Razor blades <br>
Memories fade <br>
Psychotic episodes <br>
Life's a joke <br>
Piercing bones <br>
No one knows <br>
<br>
'''Pure''' <br>
I've become purifyed <br>
See my bones from every side <br>
Rip out my limbs <br>
Play with my ribs <br>
Sick and twisted little fuck <br>
Your not skinny enough <br>
Soon I'll evaportate <br>
Selling myself in attempts to escape <br>
Hold in your self hate <br>
Let it eat you alive <br>
Soon you'll die <br>
To early to see <br>
Bones are Free <br>
Disgusting <br>
<br>
'''Good-bye''' <br>
My heart is pounding <br>
Tears are streaming <br>
My breath runs low <br>
The beats count down and begin to slow <br>
Pain is surging <br>
Seconds to spare <br>
Soft eyes let you know how much I care <br>
You think I'm gone <br>
But I'll never go <br>
I'll be by your side, in way you'll never know <br>
<br>
'''Life's a play''' <br>
Cant help but wonder where the zipper to this costume lye's <br>
Paints her face on so she can hide <br>
Denies her body food so she'll look slim <br>
Shame what a girl will do to be thin <br>
Cant stand who she is <br>
Applies her powder <br>
Lips of rouge <br>
This was never the life she wanted to choose <br>
Cameras flash <br>
While friends tell stories behind her back <br>
And behind closed curtains <br>
She claws at her skin <br>
Knows she's a burdon <br>
But never though to attempt and change herself from within <br>
Strike the stage <br>
Lets end the play <br>
the time has come for this character to fade away <br>
She's the best damn actress, but is disgustingly under paid <br>
Lights dim <br>
And the crowds cheer <br>
The darkened stage, covers her desperate fears <br>
After parties fade <br>
And fame dies with age <br>
No matter how hard she tries, she's going to have to be herself one day <br>
I sense a lie <br>
I've seen the papers and read their charts <br>
About how I dissect my own body and mind apart <br>
I'm just a simple little girl <br>
Whose to small to be in such a big world <br>
I've heard your whispers, your not as silent as you think <br>
Like the rhythmic sounds of my fading heart beat <br>
You speak of me <br>
Claim to be worried <br>
Your pathetic words are all a lie <br>
I've felt your hands on me <br>
Doctors smile and then weigh my filthy body <br>
Claim they want to solve my inner issues <br>
In truth, they just want their checks <br>
In a few weeks, they'll all forget <br>
I'll slip through the cracks <br>
And back into old habits <br>
I've tasted life <br>
Its not something I want to live <br>
No one ever saves you when you begin to fall <br>
Happiness is the biggest facade of them all <br>
Doctors, teachers, parents, and friends <br>
Promised they'd be with me till the bitter end <br>
Told me the words I so deeply wanted to hear <br>
Lied to shut my mouth about what they could bare <br>
<br>
'''Spell of a disease''' <br>
She's cast her eye upon me <br>
And I, the fool, willingly accept her disease <br>
Such an enchantress <br>
With such a powerful spell <br>
Her wicked cast has been putting my body through hell <br>
I Fell her charms, in the bones that poke through skin <br>
And now that she has me back in her power, I'll never stray from her again <br>
Her voice so deep and low, warning me to post postpone a small taste <br>
Repercussions of such a sin to the tongue <br>
The fat will such at your beauty and youth <br>
I hate her, for she speaks such truth <br>
Ana, let me go of your cast <br>
For I know your corrupted spells are bound to last <br>
Untie me from these retched lies <br>
I plead with you <br>
Let my body be free <br>
Nourishment is what I need <br>
But she has me by the throat <br>
I'd leave without permission, but she knows I wont <br>
So, I'm bound to her <br>
A slave to her <br>
She's the which who's cast this disease <br>
I've given her control over me <br>
And I'll never leave her side <br>
Ingest her horrors <br>
Feeling my bones, I take pride <br>
Ana, I'm yours <br>
Ana, I'll never stray <br>
Ana, I'm here <br>
Ana, I'll never go away <br>
<br>
'''Slave''' <br>
Shrinking me down to an unshrinkable size <br>
Ask me if I've eaten <br>
I mumble out a lie <br>
It doesn't help the hunger pain <br>
And a thirst I'd have to drown first, to satisfy <br>
Perfection is all I have to gain <br>
I'd give up all my tastes <br>
For a size zero jeans to slide effortlessly over my waist <br>
Go weeks without a bite to eat <br>
Just to run cold hands over pointed bones <br>
Losing my mind for perfection <br>
I've become isolated and alone <br>
Grab my body <br>
Try and shake her loose <br>
She wont get out <br>
This was my choice to choose <br>
Sullen <br>
Lonely <br>
My innocence has been stolen <br>
Bones are power <br>
Fight the fight, starving feels so right <br>
Exercise till your body gives from beneath you <br>
This was more work than you ever knew <br>
Your unworth to call yourself a child of Ana <br>
Get thin or get out, if you cant stand it <br>
Consuming your mind <br>
She creeps through your body <br>
Flows in and out of veins <br>
You begin to enjoy the pain <br>
Thoughts are jumbled <br>
Days become unclear <br>
My world has crumbled <br>
Death comes closer with each missed meal <br>
Starving feels so right <br>
I'm going to be doing this all my life <br>
There's no stopping me now <br>
How I ever got start, I may never know <br>
But now she's consumed me, I'm going to let her use me <br>
I'm Ana's slave till the end of my days <br>
<br>
'''Dirty Little Girl''' <br>
I've got a dirty secret <br>
It lies within my bones <br>
Hidden in the media <br>
It festers in our homes <br>
I hold a dark problem <br>
I keep it unseen <br>
Starve myself for perfection <br>
I must remain clean <br>
I'm a bad little girl <br>
Flowing through my veins <br>
Inflicting so much pain <br>
Perfection is all I have to gain <br>
I'm dying <br>
She slowly devours me <br>
I hate her <br>
Yet, she still empowers me <br>
I've got a dirty secret <br>
Hidden in my life <br>
It lies in the back of my heart <br>
And Festers in my mind <br>
<br>
'''She's Always With Me''' <br>
Tempt me with you lucious tastes <br>
Draw me in with the scent of tea and cakes <br>
I fight the urge, that lives deep within <br>
It hurts not to eat, but I'll do anything to be thin <br>
You call me dumb, You say I'm so Vain <br>
But feeling my bones is worth this much pain <br>
You Don't understand, you never will <br>
I made a vow to her <br>
I will starve, die, and pop pills <br>
She's stood by me and kept me strong <br>
She's given me control, when the rest of you have done me wrong <br>
You Say I'm sick, you wanna lock me away <br>
This is my life and I'm going to do this my way <br>
Her loyalty compels me, Her possibilities Drive me <br>
She's with me in ways no one else could be <br>
I wont be tempted by your calories and sin <br>
I feed off her strength and pull it within <br>
I've closed my mind, I refuse to feel <br>
Even though the pain she brings me is so real <br>
The Pain Drives me, The Future Inspires me <br>
<br>
'''Fear of Fat''' <br>
I'm willingly her slave <br>
And for my payment, my stomach caves <br>
Ribs penetrate <br>
Hunger subsides <br>
Calories slowly erase from my life <br>
Its becoming harder and harder to survive <br>
But inside I know <br>
If I don't feel the pain <br>
Then I'm not losing the weight <br>
Diet pills are my constant companion <br>
Life's a continual feast or famine <br>
Body shakes <br>
From the stress of self hate <br>
Give up your quest to save me, its too late <br>
Stomach lurches <br>
From such intense torture <br>
Praying to my goddess Ana <br>
Inspired by the feeling brought on by famine <br>
Spend hours before the mirror <br>
Feeling my bones <br>
Just trying to shut out the voices I hear <br>
They scream to me about the fat I consume <br>
Remind me that its time to choose <br>
Ana or Food <br>
Slamming my fists upon the glass <br>
Crying out in agony, waiting for the pain to pass <br>
It happens each time I fast <br>
But I forget my suffering, fueled by the need to not be fat]]
