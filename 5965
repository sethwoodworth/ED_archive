Currently playing on /[[b]]/, '''"old /b/ would have (x)"''' is a new lulzy [[meme]] that is played whenever <s>[[newfags]]</s> anyone fucks shit up and is [[doing it wrong]].


From [[rAIDS]] to [[advice]], when the [[peanut gallery]] catches a thread where [[OP]] has asked for such shit as [[hacker|"How does I hax IP"]]? to initiating [[GoddessTrinity|a raid that takes all day and yields little-to-nothing]], an '''old /b/ would have...''' post is inevitable.
