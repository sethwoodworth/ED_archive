Reality Distortion Field
[[Image:Stevejobs.gif|thumb|right|Steve Jobs as he is seen through the lens of the Reality Distortion Field]]

The '''Reality Distortion Field''' is the mutant capability of [[Steve Jobs]] gained by eating [[over 9000]] radioactive [[apple|apples]].  It is like [[Magneto]]'s power of magnetism, only in this case, it will make you want to buy an [[Apple]] product despite not being [[faggot|gay]].  An example of the Reality Distortion Field in action was the original iMac.  It was underpowered, overpriced, had no floppy drive, and only two [[USB]] ports.  And yet because it looked like a jellybean, everyone wanted one.  Whole books were devoted to it, websites were dedicated to it, teenage boys drew [[hentai]] representations of it -- yet it was just a gimmick.

If you are under the spell of the Reality Distortion Field, you will want to have Steve Jobs's baby, leak rumours of your illicit affair, and then buy a [[U2]] [[iPod]] to commemorate it.

The Reality Distortion Field was brought back again for the [[iPhone]], where Jobs would go on to act as if he [[Al Gore|invented the fucking]] [[internet]].
