'''John Terry''' is a [[Britfag]] footballing legend. He is also a legend for cheating on his wife with a teammate's wife around the time he was awarded "Dad of the Year" but that's another [[meme]] (with several hundred [http://www.facebook.com/pages/I-also-had-an-affair-with-John-Terry/276522784698 Failbook groups and pages]) for another day. 

As for this meme, in the England vs Slovenia match during [[2010 World Cup]] in [[South Africa]], some [[Slav]] faggot tried to slam the ball into the net. John Terry, being [[The Man|the fucking boss]] that he is, goes for a [[barrel roll|flying headbutt/salmon flop]] to try and deflect it. You know he's fucking awesome when he uses his fucking head to deflect objects.

The original picture has begun to sweep the internet, gracing it with its awesome and valor. The resulting  [[meme]] has become known as '''John Terry's Defensive Dive''' or '''The Penguin'''. There have been a few variants to the actual original image. The most popular being him destroying the [[9/11|Twin Towers]].
