'''[[tl;dr]]: The United Nations is like that faint voice in your head that tells you not to do [[Iraq|evil]], but you do so anyway 'cause you don't give a shit'''
[[Image:UN Cry baby.jpg|center]]
Although adored and [[fap]]ped to by cosmopolitan [[leftard]]s everywhere, the '''[[lie|United]] Nations''' is the biggest name in [[fail]] since the [[Epic fail|League of Nations]]. It was created after World War II to try to [[unrealistic expectations|keep the world together, help poor people in shit countries, and prevent wars]], thereby making them enemies of the [[lulz]]. It is a [[Soviet Union|union]] of corrupt diplomats who supposedly try and express their country's thoughts on current events and the economy. Even though it tries to keep member nations from doing [[War|bad things]] by introducing [[peace]] treaties every other day, this still [[fail]]s. Why? Who is going to give up fighting just because a group of pussy ambassadors said so? [[Nuke|Fire away]], good sir!

The UN has five permanent UN Security Council Member Nations, which include the:

*People's Republic of [[China]] (chink cunts who will kill your children with lead poisoning); 
*[[France]] (egotistical bastards, who think the world revolves around them and their shitty dead language); 
*[[Russia]] (Soviet twats, who would conquer your lands and rape you if they could); 
*the [[United Kingdom]] (can't even sort out their own fucking mess of a country, let alone anyone else's); 
*the [[United States]] (land of fat cunts, brainless TV stars and serial killers.)

Further adding to the fail, most nations in the UN are either Communist countries or dictatorships.  So, is it any wonder the UN can't do anything? If you are not a permanent UN Security Council Member you are required (on pain of death), to publicly [[goatse]] in the General Assembly thrice monthly. This leads to "lesser"  member states becoming their [[pwnt|bitches]].

This is how international politics works:

*1: I have fucking oil
*2: [[asking for it|You want it]]
*3: I say no
*4: You cry and have a tantrum at the UN
*5: UN  members say I'm a cunt
*6: Epic Trolling
*7: UN Members are too fucking pussy to obey their own resolutions
*8: America invades a [[Iraq|tiny oil-rich country]] and pwns it to [[Hell]]
*9: [[????]]
*10: [[Profit]]!!!! (Literally)

Due to it's repeated attempts at undermining the Constitution of the United States of America, the UN is an agency that this country has no need of, and therefore should withdraw from immediately.

==Current Leadership of the United Nations==

[[please unban|Ban]] [[Sailor Moon|Ki-]][[Mary Moon|Moon]] (Moar like [[Pokemon|Po-Ke-Mon]], Amirite?)is now Secretary General of the UN, having replaced notorious UN [[failfag]] [[nigra|Kofi Annan]].  It remains to be seen if he can actually reform the useless and corrupt bitch that is the United Nations, or if they'll still be taking bribes from Middle Eastern <s>countries</s> hovels ten years from now.

==A Very Brief History of the United Nations==
'''FACT:''' The United Nations was first conceived by [[Disney]].

Disney was even bold enough to mention "the United Nations" by it's ''supposedly not yet even selected name'' about 50 minutes into the 1943 movie "Victory Thru Air Power"! This movie, together with "Donald Gets Drafted" depicting how people wishing to serve in the Army Air Corps usually just end up on latrine duty, also played a central propaganda role in the creation of the United States Air Force in 1947. 

For their contribution, Disney was allowed to brainwash German children into thinking Donald Duck was the holy container of sage wisdom.

In April of 1945, a group of [[furfags]] convened in [[San Francisco|San Fagcrisco]] with the stated intention of creating a new world body to replace the [[failfags|failfag]] [[Justice League Unlimited|League of Nations]], which was started [[at least 100]] years before by [[nerd|the smartest U.S. president EVARZ, Wilson]]. However, being furfags, they wasted much time having [[buttsecks]] and holding ponderous, day-long [[gangbang|conferences]] on how it isn't ''really''  [[gay]] if two men have sex while wearing animal suits, as well as minting such dubious words such as "[[fursona]]" and "[[yiff]]ing", and drafting page after page of official language condemning what they termed "[[fursecution]]". This was an ominous start to the organization and set the precedent of bureaucratic inefficiency and flaming [[faggotry]] that continues to this day. 

In October of 1945, having exhausted the entire West Coast supply of lubricant, they finally ratified their Charter and the United Nations came to be. It would take them another two years to design the now-familiar official United Nations flag, mainly because [[Arabs|some sissies]] whined about the original design being centered on North America (who pay all the bills, [[amirite]]? No really, iamrite. Look it up.), and because the furfags couldn't agree on which animal print to use. The deadlock was finally broken by [[Winston Churchill]], who proposed mudkip blue, reasoning "Fellow furries, it is a most elegant solution that has the added virtue of making perfect sense. Who among us doesn't liek [[So_i_herd_u_liek_mudkip|mudkips]]?!!!1!" 

As a nod to their [[furry]] origins, The United Nations chose to [[erection|erect]] their Headquarters in Turtle Bay on the East River of New York. (Noted briefly: the Infamous Lolz Turtle has never been seen in Turtle Bay, nor will he ever be. '''UN are [[serious business]].''')

These fuckers do nothing at all but sit on their fat political asses and hug their money. committing any crime they please and getting away with it because of their fucking diplomatic immunities concerning that nation.  FUCK THE U.N YOU LAZY BASTARDS! We're talking about a group that originated from the League of Nations which also <s>didn't fucking do anything</s> let [[Hitler]] and [[Japan|Hirohito]] get away with it.

==Major Accomplishments of the United Nations==

1. Managing not to put forks in the toaster

2. Giving Islam-O-Facists a place to advocate for a worldwide "criticism of Islam law"

==Srsly, How does the U.N. Work?==

[[TL;DR]], it doesnt.

==The Future of the United Nations==

*None.
*Take a backseat to the League of Nations
*[[Fail]].
*[[Moar]][[ Fail]].
*[[Pokemon|To protect the world from devastation, To unite all peoples within their nation]]
*[[Truth|Collapse when a world war looms, as they can't do anything to stop it in the first place]].
*[[Unrealistic Expectations|Profit????]]
