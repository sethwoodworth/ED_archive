'''Gawker Media''' is an American blog network founded by Nick Denton a [[faggot|cockmongling]] Jew.  It comprises 13 or 14 different web sites, which try desperately to churn out snippy, “[[unwarranted self-importance|hip]]” remarks that will garner [[jewgolds|pageviews]] from middle-aged fats in Methtown, USA -- i.e., the only people who still consider Gawker relevant.  All commenters must be a daily cum bucket for the mods and worship all that is spoken on the [[crap]] blogs, there is no trolling or lulz in comments EVAR. Obtaining [[IRC|+v]] requires a newborn for jew sacrifice and a thorough probing by large webmaster cocks. It's important to note this article is edited at least once a day by contributors to Gawker Media. [[You]] can help by reverting their edits, identifiable because they read like advertising copy written by faggot Brooklynites who were unable to land real jobs.

==OMG GAWKER HAX!!!11!1==
Breaking news, Sunday 12th of December 2010. Oh the lulz, passwords and personal data for 1.3 million, '''1.3 MILLION,''' Gawker Media readers — this includes readers of sites like Gizmodo, Kotaku, and a few other fag sites — have been released as a torrent by a group of hackers called Gnosis, who also managed to gain access to both the Gawker CMS and Gizmodo's Twitter account. Brilliant. You can download the torrent [http://btjunkie.org/torrent/Gawkmedia-source-code-database-release-1-300-000-rows/4358d330627b4323d23441f41615d279bb0c1d498daf here].

==Gawker Stalker==

Despite Gawker's current grandstanding against such Internets 'horrors' as cyber-bulling and [[White Knighting]] against [[Anonymous]], Gawker's initial claim to fame was when they started a "[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/11945454 stalker map" -Gawker Stalker]- in [[2006]] so [[jews|Manhattanites]] could get mobile alerts as to where their fave celebrities were getting Starbucks and shit and go harass them [[IRL]].

After this interview, Emily Gould had a nervous breakdown an [[BAW|BAAWWWED]] about it [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/hot-gossip-the-fall-of-the-webs-most-glamorous-blogger-835043.html in the Jew York Times.] [[You]] can help by tracking her down and cyber-bullying her.

==Commenter Auditions==

Once upon a time, Gawker's commenter audition policy helped the site maintain a [[incestuous|media-insider]] feel.  Now it is basically a glorified captcha: although the comments do seem devoid of spambots, most of the commenters are earnest unfunny [[democrat|libtards]] who don't even hail from [[nyc]]. 

If you want to become a Gawker commenter, the first thing you should do is re-[[ass]]ess your priorities seeing as how zoophiliac scat porn would be a more dignified choice.  But maybe you want to infiltrate Gawker for purposes of trolling, in which case you should just follow these simple guidelines when penning your audition:

* Mention Si Newhouse, Graydon Carter or the Conde Nast cafeteria.  The rest of your comment can be total shit. Gawker has long harbored an obsession with all things Conde, since most of them are too fat to work there.  
* Comment as a gay man.  They'll worship you as a sassy affluencer regardless of what you say.  
* Use mostly immaculate spelling and punctuation (Gawker are olds), except when writing about the internets you should throw in some icanhazcheezburger-derived piss-poor caturday-tribute language, channeling your mom who just discovered an impossibly tame image macro and spammed it delightedly to her AOL buddy list. 
* Try to seem [[unwarranted self importance| knowing and disaffected]], except if commenting about [[Apple]] or [[Obama]] in which case you should bleed sincerity.

Alternatively, if you wish to become an approved Jezebel commenter, rather than opting to place a finger in a Rapex-guarded vagina, follow these rules for super success to-the-max FTW:

*Share your rape story. Even if you don't have one, try re-imagining that time you were lying in bed with your husband and he rubbed his MANwood against your back whilst you were trying to sleep. In your slumbery state, know that both your free will and faculty for consent were limited.  It was a violation, whether or not you are willing or able to come to terms with that.  Your husband is a latent rapist. All men are.


==Relationship between Gawker and internets==

Gawker's internets coverage has been steadily increasing since [[Project Chanology]].  The reasons for this are twofold.  First, Gawker is desperate to keep its brand young and edgy, and just like the dumbfucks in the old media they are endlessly fascinated by [[web 2.0]], [[memes]] etc which they believe are the future.  The result is a bunch of pussy 27-year-old Greenpoint residents trying to be youthful and clever by [http://gawker.com/364391/conde-nast-turns-its-social-network-into-a-facebook-app/  writing their same old posts about Conde Nast (srsly), then filling them with expressions like IDK and then tagging them "epicfail."]  (Then they [http://gawker.com/5382625/new-york-times-embraces-epic-fail/ try to criticize] old media for doing the exact same thing). Gawker is like the character Eugene Levy plays in every shitty teen comedy: he vomits up lewd teen lingo in effort to seem "with it" but just ends up embarassing himself and everyone watching. The second reason for Gawker's rampant homosexual lust over ED, /b/ et al. is that Gawker bloggers [http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/03/21/blogonomics-gawkers-payroll-redux/ are paid based on the number of pageviews they generate], and believe that baiting the chans will earn them a big fat paycheck. [[You]] can help by not even visiting these links, since enabling adblock while helpful does not diminish pageview count.  Raiding gawker and its employees is futile unless you have [[dogmongler|dogmongling]] pics of them, since they are all [[attention whores|aspiring new media personalities]] who welcome the traffic and lack any sense of shame. 

===[[Adrian Chen]]'s coverage of Jessica Leonhardt cyberbullying===
[[Last Thursday]], Gawker resident gaysian Adrian Chen decided to farm pageviews by attempting to rile /b/ with his coverage of Ebaums's raid on [[Jessi_Slaughter | "Kerligirl13"/Jessi Slaughter/Jessica Leonhardt]] and trolling of [[Dahvie Vanity|her supposed rapist]].  While /i/nsurgents and Gawker commenters alike quickly deduced this chink's self-serving plot, a small number of newfags  started threads urging a DDOS of Gawker and, predictably, a raid on Chen himself.  Gawker contributors, hoping for some of Denton's sweet sweet jewgolds, greedily screencapped these cancerous posts and re-published them as evidence of a /b/-Gawker feud.  Of course, in doing so they ignored the replies of the majority of /b/tards who, in a display of uncharacteristic wisdom, saged the cancer and disregarded Chen's attention-whoring.  Gawker continues to milk this non-incident, portraying itself as a muckraking martyr standing strong against cyberbullies.

==Can't keep track of them all:==

'''Gawker Media comprises these web sites:'''

* Anthropophage: News for the on-the-go, net-savvy gay German cannibal
* <s>Consumerist: Like Consumer Reports, for faggots who majored in Marxist Labor Theory at someplace like Tufts.</s> Broke away from Gawker, now owned by Consumer Reports.
* Deadspin: Sports news and gossip  
* Defamer: It's like a tabloid, but attracts fewer unique visitors. 
* Flagella: A website about celebrities in the protozoan world
* Fleshbot: Shitty pr0nz blog with no loli     
* Gawker: Still Denton's nominal flagship, the cool kids have jumped ship to awl and commentariat is now infested with soccer moms.  
* <s>Gizmodo</s> Jizzmodo: About the latest gadgets and gizmos, as long as they are made by Apple
* Gridskipper: Travel
* io9: Shitty recaps of sci-fi/fantasy TV shows, movie spoilers, [[transhumanism]], science news.
* Idolator: Basically the same dumb pieces of shit who write [[Pitchfork]].  
* Jalopnik: For automobile fetishists
* Jezebel: [[feminists | Fat cumdumpsters]] who graduated from mediocre liberal arts colleges, wear crap purchased off [[Etsy]], and are on a perpetual righteous feminist crusade to get fashion mags to feature more [[Oprah | obese nigras]].  The Gawker commenter-audition filter tries to prevent you from trolling these whores; fortunately, they are [[emo | weaklings who take everything supersrsly]], so it doesn't take much to set them off. Staff writer Tracie Egan once declared in an interview that she was [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lizz-winstead/jezebelism_b_110903.html "too smart" to be raped] - a comment which outraged much of the readership and led to calls for her resignation - but Nick Denton kept her on staff, because she generates lots of pageview$, which in turn funds his penchant for [[shota|fudgepacking Manhattan rent boys]].
* Kotaku: About the latest new games; critique, nostalgia, prediction, design. [[Slowpoke|Always 2 weeks behind in news]]. Basically the national enquirer of gaming blogs.
* Lifehacker: [[shit no one cares about|hotkeys]], [[Rainmeter|useless apps]], [[browser]] wars, getting your [[OS]] [[retarded|to act like a different one]], bullshit fringe health advice, projects stolen from Indestructibles.com, [[User-generated content|reader's opinion]] of the latest [[MSPaint]] clone, sucking [[Firefox]]'s cock
* Partyvan: Sightings of girls in the 'tween set, with speculation about their underwear colors
* Valleywag: Silicon Valley gossip and news
* Wonkette: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X8dLXvqu8k WALNUTS!] Warning: Rose to fame by being edited by a modestly non-fugly chick. Now run entirely by an [[emo]] fuck. Denton sold the blog to some warmed-over [[Web 1.0]] loser when it became clear he couldn't make any [[money]] off of it.
