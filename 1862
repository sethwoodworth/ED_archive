[[Image:SPEEDY.JPG|thumb|right|The [http://www.speedyhire.co.uk official criteria for speedy deletion fanboi website]. [[Irony|Ironically]], it too is probably [[non-notable]]. Note the [[newfag]] [[fail]]ure to create a real [[demotivator]].]]

[[Image:MUZZY.JPG|thumb|right|[[Typical]] subject of an article which would NOT meet Wikipedia's criteria for speedy deletion. Take 90 years off that face, and she'd be a 20-year-old French girl, and you'd probably want to [[fuck]] her.]]
The '''criteria for [[speedycat|speedy]] deletion''' is a process used by [[Bureaucratic Fuck]]s on [[Wikipedia]] to get rid of all the [[spam]], [[unwarranted self-importance|vanity]], [[vandalism]], [[uncyclopedia|nonsense]], and anything else that they decide is "[[DO NOT WANT|inappropriate for the encyclopedia]]".

Why does this happen? Well, [[bitches don't know]] about the criteria, as [[Wikipe-tan]] points out. They just naively think that Wikipedia is "about everything" and proceed to insert material into the encyclopedia that [[serious business|does not cite any references or sources]]. The [[typical]] [[Wikipedophile]] spends [[over 9000]] hours of their life continually monitoring and inspecting the pages that these [[newfags]] create, most of which are utter [[shit]].  It is estimated that at least one attack page is created on Wikipedia every minute, mainly consisting of [[13-year-old boys]] causing these [[nerd|nerds]] distress by adding vandalism and harassment against their best friends and the [[shit nobody cares about|discoveries]] of [[CSIII|computer science]] graduates from New Delhi, [[India]].  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion page itself] is incredibly [[TL;DR]], so [[you]] too should not read it.

Help waste the [[Rape Clock|time]] of Wikipedia admins and [[basement dweller|new page watchers]] by creating [[moar]] inappropriate pages on Wikipedia. [[List of ways to win at the internet|The ultimate prize]] is to see your page [[delete fucking everything|protected to prevent creation]] (or 'salted') and appearing in a [[condom|protection]] log!



==Criteria for speedy deletion on ED==
# '''Pure [[faggotry]]'''.
# '''[[Unfunny]] articles''', the sort of [[fail]] that [[Uncyclopedia]] is crammed with.
# '''GRIDS that is killing ED:''' see [[Exhibit A]], [[Exhibit B]], [[Exhibit C]], & [[Exhibit D]].
# '''[[Urbandictionary]] entries'''
# '''Unwarranted self-importance/Vanity''' articles.
# '''Things [[Special:Listadmins|these people don't like]] for whatever reason without needing some bureaucratic list.'''

What these [[noobs]] don't realise is that in the small print, they have signed over everything they have written to [[Jimbo Wales]] already. That means that he can use your biography and personal details if you post them, even if they appear to have been deleted, they are ALL still stored on Wikipedia's database ([[srsly]]). This is because Jimbo is a fucking [[faggot]] and also a control freak who thinks that he rules the Internet. [[Tool|THINK FOR YOURSELF]]! We should stage a [[France|coup d'etat]] on Wikipedia of Jimbo Wales, where we take him out [[IRL]], and block all the admins etcetera and fill it with vandalism... [[I did it for the lulz|for the lulz]].

==Typical [[BAW|bawwwing]] newfag Wikipedo getting pwnt by the CSD==
{{quote|I have added the 'hangon' on my page. However I am not sure if it is at right place. Dear sir, I would like to say sometimg about Aashritha. This is a not-for-profit group formed by some friends and they all are working towards child education for poor and needy people in India. I have recently joined the cause and I thought that to create awareness and spread the good message about Aashritha, I should use the Wikipedia platform. I am not sure if Aashritha conforms the wiki standards of being notable or not. Please check the url http://sites.google.com/site/aashrithagroup/Aashritha for details on Aashritha. I reuqest you to allow the Aashritha page on wiki, and I also confirm that contents included are fully correct and I am not intending to promote the group or community via wikipedia. --Sandeep.jgupta (talk) 21:50, 27 June 2008 (UTC) —Preceding unsigned comment added by Sandeep.jgupta (talk • contribs) 21:40, 27 June 2008 (UTC)}}
