The co-founder of [[YouTube]] with [[Steve Chen]] and [[pakis|Jawed "Jaws" Karim]], Chad is suspected of recently creating his own [[sockpuppet]] at YouTube after being made aware of the ongoing [[ED]]/[[Bantown]] vs. [[Argent009]] [[drama]] and decided he wanted a piece of the [[lulz|action]].

[[ED]]'s [[Detective|sources]] at YouTube have [[AIM|hinted]] that Chad was recently drawn into the [[troll]]ing by Chen himself who is thought to have created his own [[sock]] account to [[pwn]] Argent009 after becoming [[stop posting|sick and tired]] of all his [[email|Inbox]] are belonging to Argent's incessant [[cry|bitching]] about the '[[haters]]' from Bantown and ED pwnting [[fail it|his life]] and wheelchair upside down.

Additionally, one ''does'' have to admit that the fact that the fucking ''co-founder'' of YouTube himself recognizes and actively participates in trolling and doing it for the lulz... Fucking admirable indeed.



==The [[Sock]]==

As of writing, Chad's sock account is <strike>suspected</strike> confirmed <small>2/10/07, 2:00am PST</small> to be [http://youtube.com/profile?user=BantownInYourTubes '''BantownInYourTubes'''] which was created just in time for the [[flame war|comment war]] following '''Argent's''' announcement that he was [[YHBT|quitting YouTube forever]] in his instant [[lulz|classic]] [[fail|concessionary]] [[vlog]] {{youtube|6Dvdib8St_I|"Goodbye"}}, a p√¶an to [[unwarranted self importance|his bad self]], his [[ego|pride]] and generally being a [[cunt|pussy motherfucker]] with a taste for [[Geriatric1927|old man]] [[lemonparty|cock]]. 

After initially stating that he would let the 'haters' comments [[post|fly]] (apart from every [[EDiot]] he'd already [[Blockatiel|blocked]] of course), he [[faggotry|disabled commenting]] on this [[crap|masterpiece]] of [[unwarranted self-importance|understatement]] when pretty much the whole YouTube [[community]] started wishing him [[GTFO|good riddance]] and [[Get_banned_faggot|plz 2 be die]], including '''BantownInYourTubes''' -an "employee of YouTube"- who dropped in to post that everyone at YT HQ, from the [[sysop|admins]] to [[The Man|the brass]] hated him and while they were glad to see him [[GTFO]] to [[LiveVideo]], were sorry to lose a prize [[lolcow]]. 
 
Never one to resist a tasty morsel of [[flame|troll bait]] left out for his fat ass, Argent started weighing in as usual like a [[Nazi]] bull in a Jew china shop, provoking even [[moar]] flaming and lulz, mostly from his former e-pals and people ED has never heard of. 

==The Troll==
[[Image:YouTube_GOODBYE.jpeg|thumb|'''BantownInYourTubes''' appears for the first time and weighs in on Argent's [[butthurt|bellyaching]].]]
At this point '''BantownInYourTubes''' became especially active, replying to comments both pro and anti-Argent, but always in the 'hushed tones' of an individual overly familiar and compliant with the YouTube [[TOS]] rather than acrid flames favored by your average [[EDiot]] on a troll. Funnily enough, these reasonable posts seemed to [[butthurt|irk]] Argent more than usual and he started accusing several commentators of being YouTube employees and that, since he was a close personal friend with [[Steve Chen]], they were all in trouble.

'''BantownInYourTubes''' then all but outed himself as [[Chad Hurley]] by posting that -in all seriousness- whilst YouTube were grateful for his patronage, they were even more excited about the fresh [[lulz]] and drama ED had brought to YouTube and that everyone at YouTube had become big fans of ED. He went on to say that the only reason that he wasn't banned already was because since [[LiveVideo]] was made of faggotry and FAIL he'd be back for more ED [[ass rape|drama]], despite Argent's threat that his leaving would spark an [[fire drill|exodus]] that would destroy YouTube and that he would personally make [[LiveVideo]] TIME Magazine's "Invention of the Year, 2007" (as YouTube had been in [[2006]]). 




==JEW==
JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW 

==Epilogue==

Of course, you can't read most of the 150+ comments (even the less inflammatory ones) since Argent deleted all but the comments that he liked, cherry-picking the ones that hadn't inflamed his [[butthurt|hemorrhoidal butt]] and -because it's directly connected to his mouth- had him spouting shit from his [[ass|foul mouth]].

However, ED's got moar [[penis|fingers]] in [[moar]] [[pie]]s than [[Ron Jeremy]], and [[Spyware|our man]] in [[YouTube|San Bruno]] will soon be releasing all documents pursuant to Argent's stormy 'tenure' as YouTube's resident [[lolcow|LOLcow]].
