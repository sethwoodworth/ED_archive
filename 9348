Hi! I'm '''Zenofeller''',  [[Loli-chan|Minor]] [[God]] of the [[Internet]]. =)

My entire site is illegal, but that's okay because I'm not even 18 and I don't know shit about wiki or html.

I have a really high pagerank and I will totally take away all of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]'s and [[Uncyclopedia]]'s traffic.

Keeping this site up is a huge [[Internet Law|legal]] liability for my parents, Pat and Michelle McCuller, because I'm not even old enough to be sued.  They'll probably stop paying for my website, and I will have to earn my Alexarank of 200,000 all over again.

I am a [[faggot]] with no originality who got tired of ripping off [[Maddox]] and decided to rip off the thousands of editors at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] and [[Uncyclopedia]].

I have no friends so I write a blog which no one reads =(.  In fact, I am universally regarded as a dumbass who tries to advertise his site on forums and every [[forum]] has had a majority tell me to fuck off and that my site isn't even close to funny.

My site gets ''so many hits'' and my scripts are ''so good'' that I CRASHED MY [[AOL|ISP]].

I love to talk like I'm smart or like I know how to do [[fuck]]ing anything, but it's pretty easy to tell I'm completely [[fucktard]]ed.

YEAH, 50 PEOPLE HAVE READ EACH ONE OF MY ARTICLES! I SHOULD BE RANKED WAY HIGHER THAN 200,000!
