'''Kevin Provance''', aka '''C. Kevin Provance''', aka '''Casey Ravencop''' is a 30-something year old divorcee who lives out his life as a [[pedophile|poster child]] for deranged trolls everywhere.  [[basement-dwelling|Living happily in his mother's basement]] in Bradenton, Florida, Kevin works hard on a daily basis to become the ultimate [[troll]].  His mission is one of world domination, and ultimately claiming his title as the [[Internet_tough_guy|overlord of the internets]].

==Interests==
[[Image:Kevpeen.gif|thumb|om nom nom]]

Kevin's various websites lists his interests as [[Nerd|chess]], [[QBASIC|programming]], [[Fanfiction|writing]], [[Shitty_art|drawing]], [[whore|craving]], and [[retard|understanding]].  Sadly for him, he's completely [[shit]] at all of those things.  He also has an [[Pedophile|eight-year-old]] [[Abortion|son]], Spencer, whom he maintains a mild interest in [[fucking|seeing]] when his estranged [[Wife|wife]] is [[batshit|insane]] enough to let him [[rape|have custody of]] (though only while strictly supervised).  Kevin also enjoys declaring [[You|anyone]] who disagrees with him to be [[normal|insane]], a [[Nazi]], deranged, stalking him, or [[trolling]] (by daring to reply to anything he's ever posted with a contradictory viewpoint).  Kevin is also an enormous fan of [[Star Trek]], and in his spare time he wonders why he can't seem get women to like him - particularly "Brooke", the waitress whom <s>he stalks on a regular basis</s> EDIT ''he hasn't stalked her since he buried her in his mother's back yard last year''.  And finally, Kevin enjoys making fun of the victims of psychopathic murderers, such as those killed by [[An_hero|George Sodini]].

{{quote|"NO!" He spat. "JOHNNY LOOOOVED THE NIGGERS. NIGGER LOVER. GODDAM NIGGER LOVER!"|A typical line from any of Kevin's short stories collection.}}

==Midlife Crisis==
After divorcing his first wife, giving her half of everything, and letting her keep the mattress to their marital bed which (in his own words) was now soaked with the cum-stains of another man (no srsly!), Kevin went straight to the local car dealership and bought himself a silver [[penis|Corvette Convertible]].  He felt this complemented his other choice in car - a 1981 Delorean with the license plate "DMC XP".  After purchasing [[twat|"The Vette"]], CK then went to the local health clinic to get tested for all the venereal diseases his wife's many boyfriends had.

==Portrait of a Troll==
[[Image:Ihasashuvel.jpg|thumb|left|Kevin and his GAT]]

Poor [[Cunt|C.]] Kevin Provance evidently had a difficult childhood, if his [[shit nobody cares about|whiny bitch blog]] is anything to go by.  He laments being picked on as a young boy, and blames it all on refusing to buckle to [[cool|peer pressure]] which is why he never did drugs, alcohol, or kissed a girl.

Reading virtually any random page on Kevin's blog reveals masses of drama from a variety of points, yet strangely no mention of regular visits to a psychotherapist.  His life consists of responding to emails, Googling dirt on anyone who challenges him, abusing his son when the social worker goes outside for a cigarette, and ranting about how his favourite language, Visual Basic 6, is being illegally and dishonestly scrapped by Microsoft.  Here are a few of Kevin's eloquent quotes from various sources:

<center>{{frame|{{morphquote|quoteid|background-color: white; width: 500px; height: 150px;|font-weight: bold;|[[I has a shuvel|I have a gun now...]]so have him take his chances where he may there|Kevin, letting the world know what a responsible father he is|Spencer and I are very close.

==Guardian of the Newsgroup==
[[Image:KevsID.jpg|thumb|right|Early days of an Internet tough guy]]
Ol' Casey can be found on microsoft.public.vb.general.discussion, feverishly defending "Classic" Visual Basic and preaching the imminent destruction of its successor (which replaced it in 2002), VB.NET.  This can provide an unending source of [[lulz]] by virtue of his hatred for anything .NET based.  Simply ask a VB.NET question in "his" VB newsgroup and wait for him to take the trollbait.  This was tolerated for some time by many lurkers until it was discovered that Kevin's true technical expertise may not actually live up to the hype...

==Career (of sorts)==
[[Image:Kevin Provance4.jpg|thumb|Shifty [[troll]] is shifty]]

A self professed code-whiz, Kevin makes [[lies|millions]] each year selling his [[crap|super professional]] software via the internetz.  Kevin literally spent years portraying himself as an authority on all large corporate software ever written, and implied he had years worth of valuable experience engineering "software solutions" for big businesses.  However, upon closer inspection it seems his "software solutions" are a collection of [[AOL]] chat [[Butt plug|plugins]] written in [[QBASIC|VB]] which net him a modest monthly sum - enough to pay the light bill and keep his bitchy [[whore|mom]] off his back about getting a real job.  His biggest corporate customer?  Your thirteen year old [[loli|daughter]] who likes to hear her computer make a sound like a [[bestiality|horse]] whenever anyone says "lol".

===Bidniss===
Kev's [[Serious_business|business]] is TPASoft.com - a large multinational that employs the following people, in alphabetical order:

# C. Kevin Provance

[[cock|Casey]] [[KKK|K]]evin bemoans how difficult his life is after becoming [[internet famous]], and how difficult it is to go into [[AOL]] chat rooms to seek out his next teenage rape victim when everyone knows him.  Let's all empathise with Kevin for a moment so we can understand what it must be like to be instantly recognised in an AOL chat room.  Oh the trauma!  How would one ever make it through the day?  Being an [[unwarranted self importance|AOL chat room celebrity]] must be a difficult life indeed. [[OH WAIT!]] except for the fact that [[Losers|nobody uses AOL chat anymore]] and [[nobody cares]]

==Recent Activites==
[[Image:Kevin Provance5.jpg|thumb|Marty, we have to go back! Back to when VB6 still worked, and I was happily married!]]
[[Image:Tn_August2004_044.jpg|thumb|left|<s>Inside Kevin's car</s> scratch that, the bank reposessed it last week.]]

As of September 2009, poor abused little Kev lost his job, most of his money, and is on the verge of losing his house also.  Rather than search for a new job to pay his babydaddy bills, Casey opted instead to harass celebrities that he doesn't like via Twitter.  Some recent gems include:

{{quote|'''@mileycyrus:''' Boo hoo. You wanted fame, glory, and money? Now pay the piper, or end up like Britney...knocked up and drugged out.|Engaging Hannah Montana with friendly chit chat}}

{{quote|'''@JessicaSimpson:''' OMFG...it's a DOG! Not a human baby. It's coyote poop by now. Move on.|Consoling Jessica Simpson over her lost dog}}

==Reactions to his Recaptured Internet Fame==
[[Image:Kevin Provance7.jpg|thumb|[[Lens Flare]]!]]
Shortly after wise EDiots created this page to document Kevin's colorful contributions to the world wide intarwebs, the master [[troll]] himself soon learned of it (probably during one of his nightly three hour sessions of [[masturbation|self-Googlage]]).  Proving to the world that he didn't care what a silly little site like ED had to say about him, he managed to ignore the page for at least thirty minutes before rampantly locking down every blog, website and online user profile he had ever created.  He then proceeded to vandalise this page.<br /><br />
Lending further evidence to his mental instabilities, C Kevin decided the best form of defense in this instance was attack.  His primary [[User:1Conundrum|conundrum]] however was that he had no idea who to focus his attacks upon, and therefore picked a natural target - his uncle, [[User:UncleBastard2u|Mark Provance]].  Dismayed at all the dramatic incidents of his life being documented for all to see, Kevin decided not to delete fucking everything, but instead to actually add more drama to the article itself.  A portion of one of his attempts at vandalising this page follows:

 Got your snail mail, Mark Provance, the black sheep uncle of my family. For the love of Christ, will you hurry up and die already?<br/ >I know you're saddled with the fattest most disgusting lop of shit for a wife, but you need to focus your rage and jealously someplace else.<br/ >And um...to be honest, you have no place calling anyone else dumpy. Looked in the mirror lately?<br/ >If you can get past that pasty gray skin, you'd realize that you're pushing a metric ton yourself.<br/ >If you're still pissed off that I outed your molestation of a student at my former high school on classmates.com<br/ >while you were a teacher there, get the fuck over it already.<br/ >She does not want you, no matter how many times you tell yourself that in your deranged psychopathic head.<br/ >Let it go, and you'll be a lot happier, m'kay? By the way - and I love being the one to tell you this -<br/ >no one, and I mean no one in our family has ever liked Stacey.<br/ >I think that should have been evident to you at Nana's funeral.<br/ >No one wanted you there. The fact that you invited yourself after we tried our hardest to deceive you just ruined the day for everyone.<br/ >And what did you do? You got up on stage and talked about YOURSELF!! Who fucking cares Mark!!<br/ >No one. Not now, not ever!! And your interview about Teddy Jump, how you two shared a bond? Lovely. Does this mean you are coming out of the closet now?<br/ >If so, make sure you give my father a great big butt fucking while you're at it.<br/ >And lastly, dear deranged uncle, just because you chose to ignore and abandon your own mother in the autumn years of her life<br/ >does not mean we will all follow in your path. You mock me for having a relationship with my own mother in which you label<br/ >me a pussy for actually talking to the woman who gave birth to me?<br/ >Yeah, I guess that would be a shock for you considering the shitty way you treated your own.<br/ >If you ever feel the need to cry on her shoulder, you'll have to dunk your fat fucking head in the seven seas lagoon at Disney.<br/ >And if you choose to do so, do us all a HUGE favour and don't come up for air. Have a *great* day!!

[[Image:Kevin Provance9.jpg|thumb|HEY YOU GUYS LOL!]]
[[Some argue]] that his uncle, or at least the account created on ED representing Mark Provance, is actually Kevin [[divide by zero|attempting to troll himself]].  If true, this would make him one of the world's greatest trolls to date.  If false however, it would simply mean he has one seriously fucked up family.  One of the greatest sources of ''K-prov'' humour, his retired blog "Synthetic Reality", was also removed during his mad Def-Con 1 panic attack.  Happily though, [[Shit was SO cash|shit was so Google-cached]] and fresh material continues to be added to his list of infamous quotes, along with screenshots of his blog.

==Latest Whinery==
[[Image:Kevin Provance8.jpg|thumb|Stroking his cock]]
After Microsoft dropped the bomb on the archaic NNTP servers and signalled the end of their managed Newsgroups, Kevin went into a shitstorm of a hissy fit at the thought of losing one of his most valued playgrounds.  Doubtless terrified as to how he would exert his internet superiority over others if the groups vanished into a cloud of digital [[nobody cares|nobody-gave-a-shit-anyway]] smoke, he immediately took the fight directly to Microsoft with a firm but friendly email, filled with intelligent succinct points and plagiarized Family Guy jokes:

 My latest reply to Sruthi Ramaashs ::some 911 sounding name:: ishish<br/ ><br/ >
 I'm sure that's a raft of crap as well.  A canned response from some call center in india carries NO weight.<br/ >When I hear from someone out of the USA with an English name, I'll be impressed.<br/ >Puppet.<br/ ><br/ >But hey, the object since day one of MSFT's marketing project known as .NET<br/ >was to eliminate VB6 and everything associated with it.<br/ >Mission accomplished.  I hope you marketing @$$holes feel good about yourselves.

==Latest Occupation==
[[Image:Kevin Provance11.jpg|thumb|Yeah! Take that, Class of '89! You take it good!]]
To prove to his former classmates just what a wild success his life has been, CKP created a profile on his former school's website.  Amidst the happily married doctors, lawyers, teachers and real estate agents, Kevin lists himself as being a 20/21 Century Backstep.  For the uninformed, this is also known as a TimeCop, which is also known as inventing an important sounding job description for a position that he doesn't have.  At a job that doesn't exist.  At a fictitious company.  Which is responsible for solving non-existent problems.  I suppose the general gist would be that this is bullshit.  Yep, just a giant, steamy, crock of fly-larvae-breeding, field-fertilizing, fantasy-world bullshit.  Straight from the horse's mouth, or in this case the cow's anus:

 Um, lessee....got into computers in the early 90's when that was the big new thing.  Wrote some software the became popular, <br />made a bunch of money, got married too young which did produce one awesome son.<br />Got divorced too soon (not my doing, women are just plain evil),<br />went into seclusion, developed some new theories in inter-dimensional <br />communication and was eventually recruited by Chronos Technologies.<br />Now I advise them on current events for future studies which enable chrononauts<br />a less paradoxical backstep into the 21st century.<br />Eventually I will become a mentor in turn of the century history, teaching in the last 22nd century to most of your grandkids.<br /><br />Take that Class of '89.

==Trollbait==
[[Image:Kevin Provance6.JPG|thumb|Generic deep moody self shot.]]
If you're feeling bored and lonely, and if you don't have an 8 year old son take your pent up sexual aggression out on the way Casey Kevin Provance does, then you can fire up your favourite news client and head on over to [nntp://microsoft.public.vb.general.discussion microsoft.public.vb.general.discussion] and ask any of the following:

# Why is this newsgroup still active?  I thought Microsoft killed VB6 in 2002?
# I think I found a bug in VB6 - how can I get Microsoft to fix it?
# How do I do (anything) in VB.NET?
(The flame responses will come here, which then leads to your response of):
# But this is a general discussion group for VB.  I asked a VB question, what's the problem?

The above can often lead to responses from Kevin such as:

{{quote|This group and all groups with .vb are for VB6 or lower. The *real* VB, not the bloated excuse MS calls VB.NET. ... If you're going to challange me, you're not going to like it.|Kevin, using his power as owner of the internet to tell a newbie to go fuck themselves.}}

Kevin will also regularly post his deep-seated hatred for all things Microsoft, whilst simultaneously preaching the joy of the 11 year old VB6 programming language - created by none other than Microsoft.
