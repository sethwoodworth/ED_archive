Kangaroo Jack
{{merge|Candlejack}}
== Background ==

'''Kangaroo Jack''' was developed in response to all the [[faggot]] threads about a guy called Jack who loved Candles. Some bright spark [[Aussie]] decided to create a rather well disguised [[troll]] to the point that still to this day, [[newfag]]s fail to notice Kangaroo Jack within the short story. In the movie he is [[fail|hit]] by a [[lolwut|car]] while looking for the nearest safe place to calm his [[PCP]] [[masterbation|addicition]]. When the [[retards|two guys]] come to see what happened they find the kangaroo dead on the street. To make sure he [[dies alone]] in black person, the [[you|white guy]] gives him his "lucky" jacket filled with [[atleast 100|$5000]]. When they leave him to die alone it wakes up and tries to act black throughout the rest of the movie until it gives the two retards so much weed they think they [[LOLWUT|can talk to animals]]. The end. Now go die.

Around our fireplace, we have a double/triple couch for the kids and my wife and I have an nice armchair each (pic related - it's fairly similar to mine).

At night, after a day at work, I really enjoy just coming home to my family and a cooked dinner then retreating to the fireplace where I indulge in my armchair with some really nice soothing music, perhaps a scented candle, Jack Daniels in a tumbler sitting on the coffee table while my wife and the ki
