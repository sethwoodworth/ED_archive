[[Image:Gor dongiraffe.jpg|thumb|Gordon circa 2008, after his guest appearance in ''[[Super Smash Bros.|Brawl]]''.]]

'''Gordon the Pringles Giraffe''' is a forced meme dating back to 2006, when some [[13 year old boy]] with [[Asperger's syndrome]] combined his two favorite things: Pringles and giraffes. By these things (and some [[MS Paint]]) combined, here comes Gordon, the Pringles Giraffe. Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with children these days? Obviously this made absolutely no sense, which is lulzy enough, but the lulz wouldn't end there. Gordon eventually galloped onto [[4chan|4chan's]] [[/b/]] in the summer of 2008, where he gained meme status due to the fact that he looked so fucking weird. Also, he was some of the first [[original content]] that /b/ had seen in a while, even if it hadn't been drawn by a fellow /b/tard.

Gordon is one of the only four forced memes to be considered win, the others being [[So Cash]], [[DESU]], and [[FUCK YEAH SEAKING]], due to their [[Oh exploitable|endless possibilities]]. Most notable are his seamless transitions in element type, as shown below:

Gordon has been remade numerous times since first posted on /b/, and has become yet another poor member of the 4chan family. While some who find him annoying because he is just so strange looking, some /b/tards took the initiative of  adopting poor Gordon, perhaps thereby creating a whole family of weird-ass giraffes. Gordon can often be found hanging out at watering holes and playgrounds, luring in little children with his [[kawaii]] looks and [[Guido]] mustache.

Gordon is what every giraffe wants to be when it grows up, even if he looks like a fucking monster.

==The Shrimp and Hippo Team==

[[Image:Gor doncomic.png|thumb|Gordon's first appearance.]]

There is much speculation over who originally created this strange monstrosity, whether it's a [[retard]] or a gifted artist we'll never truly know (somewhat like the debate between [[Chris-chan]] and Jimmy Hill). It is [[some argue|widely believed]] that Gordon originates from a group called the Shrimp and Hippo Team, composed of a 12 year old kid who recently discovered how to use Adobe Flash and some other one that made a shitty comic called ''Stuperman''. Stuperman's creator was the one who devised the creation of Gordon, and introduced him to the ''Shrimp and Hippo'' series, though no movies were made with him (thank god). After making his debut in the comic on your right, news quickly spread across the interwebs about his existence and his picture was spread to multiple forums including Gamespot and various others. An artist by the name of [[User:Malion|Malion]] decided to bring more life to Gordon's image and turn him into a masterpiece rivaling that of any da Vinci painting. Much drama was caused when Malion found out that Gordon was brought to /b/ and eventually [[ED]] by [[User:Crazyconan|Crazyconan]], but it was eventually settled and Malion to this day submits various (and hilarious) drawings of Gordon to us, making ED the new owner of the Pringles giraffe.

'''To view the drama on ED's behalf, read [[Talk:Gordon the Pringles Giraffe|this article's talk page]].'''

==Disappearance==

[[Image:gorpaper.jpg|thumb|FOUND!]]

Shortly after his reemergence in September, someone forgot to lock the gate on Gordon's cage and he ran off, fleeing from the faggots at [[/b/]]. The reward for Gordon's capture was +1 internets.

==Found==
During the terrifying [[Lamp]] forcing of November 14th, Gordon returned to /b/ after realizing the horrible cancer his master was facing. He proceeded to fight back, and was nearly taken over by the cancer himself. But Gordon overcame.

[[old meme|Gordon will always overcome.]]

With the recent events and happenings of [[Chris-chan]] (including his infamous doll sex-tape), it has been announced that for the 2009 Presidential election of [[hell|CWCville]] that Gordon will be running for the office of President alongside CWC as mayor. His challengers include [[Billy Mays]] and other memes, though it has been predicted that Gordon will be the likely winner in this shitstorm of retards and crappy drawings. It has been recently disclosed that Billy Mays has taken over as the mayor of CWCville with Chris out of [[faggotry|action]], but Gordon still has a good chance of winning the presidency (though noone would really want to anyways) and along Billy Mays clean up the filth of CWCville.
