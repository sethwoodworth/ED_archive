Since 1591, [[Cunt|unpleasant individuals]] have been referred to as "Vipers" as it was England's only poisonous [[Metal Gear Solid|snake.]] A '''Nest Of Vipers''' refers to running headlong into a [[4chan|dangerous situation,]] tragically oblivious to one's [[fail|peril.]]

New users are typically unaware of what a wretched hive of scum and villainy the internet is. You should expect putting your foot into a nest of vipers to be a weekly occurrence until you start to [[lurk moar]].

=Typical Scenario=

# Read ED.
# Note with interest that [[Mudkips]] are a [[chan]] [[meme]].
# Wade into [[4chan]] [[b|/b/]] blaring "HAY GAIZ I HERD YOU LIEK MUDKIPZ"
# Ridicule
# Rape
# Possible [[b&]]
