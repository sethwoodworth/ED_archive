Similar to [[quitting IRC forever]] and being [[done with ED]], a wikibreak is when someone on [[Wikipedia]] claims he won't be editing for a while &mdash; meaning that he's decided not to use a certain [[sockpuppet]] for a while.

==Why?==

Well, in a word, [[Wikistress]].

Often, this is done when someone gets de-admined and now must make a new account and work up to being [[admin]] again, or else buy an admin account on [[eBay]] (e.g., [[NSLE]]).

Another [[reason]] for going on a wikibreak is so [[friend]]s of [[you]]rs and people on the fence will join your side of a debate after seeing what a bunch of [[jerk]]s the other side is. The breaker basically martyrs himself for the sake of the argument. However, he usually pops back up the same week after the debate ends.

Other times the breaker is someone who [[piss]]ed off [[everyone]] so much that he decides to leave until everyone he knows is gone ([[at least 100 years|2 months]]).
