Peter Pan

Look no further! '''Randy Constan''' ''is'' '''Peter Pan'''. This may confuse you, because before Randy was discovered it was believed that [[Michael Jackson]] was the one and only Peter Pan. That however is false. Randy not only creates his own music while touching [[13-year-old boys]], but as opposed to Michael he knows how to use [[Internets|teh internets]].
<br><br>'''Pans two favorite quotes''':

"''Kids. They're not easy. But there has to be some penalty for sex.''" -- [[Pedophile|Bill Maher]] 

"''Unless you become as little [[Children]], you can't see [[God|God's]] kingdom.''" -- [[Hippy|Jesus]]


==History of Pete==
[[Image:Littlepan.jpg|thumb|left|In his younger years.]]
Apparently Peter Pan was born [[at least 100 years ago]] in New York. Many psychologists would suggest that Peter Pan is a victim of [[Pedophilia]]. Which helps us understand why in our modern times he lures kids into his bed and then [[Molest|"punishes"]] them.
==Peter Pan Of Today==
As of today Peter Pan is living in Tampa Bay, [[Florida]]. He is [[Old|52 years old]] and claims he is still only 14 years of age, making it perfectly okay to express his love for "other [[children]]". I'd advise anyone living on Tampa Bay to locking all their doors and windows before someone ends up on [http://www.amw.com/ America's Most Wanted]. 

It is said that Peter Pan made his homepage in an attempt to get a [[girlfriend]] and quite possibly a [[Prostitute|wife]], but we all know that really he is just a [[fag]]. On his homepage you can buy "Be A Pixie" T-Shirts for $22 of [[money|irl munnies]] through paypal, which is a guaranteed way to get shot dead when walking near a [[ghetto]]. Highely recommended  for all the [[The_great_emo_suicide_meme_of_2005|emo fAgetz]] out there.

=/x/=
Recent speculation has arisen on 4chan's [[X|/x/]] board that Peter Pan's true identity is actually that of the Slender Man, but [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody gives a shit]] because [[You|everybody]] is too busy fapping over [[The Grifter]].
