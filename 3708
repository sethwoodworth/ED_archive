High School Musical
[[Image:Camp-rock-dvd-cove.jpg|thumb|240px|right|PLAGUE ALERT!]]

'''''High School Musical''''' is a [[Lie|marvelously droll and amusing musical]] produced by [[Nazi|Disney]] [[lol|artists]]. It rivals in originality with <strike>Nod Nod Goes to The Farm</strike> even Nod Nod is more original than this and in musical skills with [[Hannah Montana]], which is to say something. It's about a girl, and a boy, and [[Crap|singing and dancing and drama and stuff]]. Roughly. It is also the new [[Bible]] for 6 year-old girls who live in [[Kentucky]].

== Plot ==

[[Image:Vh High School Musical.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The first scene in this crap.]]

''High School Musical'' is a Disney [[porn|film]] based around the concept of a handful [[Faggots|pubescent moronic twats]] embarking on their trip through high school, [[lolwut|BUT WITH A FUCKING TWIST]]. They dance like legless drunk tramps, while the singing matches the aforementioned description as it sounds like the tone-deaf singing of a homeless man [[piss]]ed out of his head, while staggering down a dingy alleyway waving a whiskey bottle above his head and worshiping it in all its [[alcoholic]] splendor. 

The movie starts out with a cliché basketball jock getting it on with his [[dad]] at a ski resort. When he goes to a New-years [[yiff|party]], he ends up [[AIDS|singing karaoke]] with a [[Vanessa Hudgens|Chinese wetback]]. Amazingly, the two have a perfect harmony and are completely on-key regardless of never having met before. When he goes back to school after winter break, it turns out the shitty nerd has [[Stalk|transferred]] into his [[Prison|school]]. But like any little-kid tragedy, he’s not allowed to talk to her because his basket-ball buddies convince him it’s not cool. BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWW! Both the [[nerd]] and jock deny they want to sing, [[cliché|but end up auditioning for the school music regardless, and end up getting the role after call-backs]]. In the end, it’s all [[Disney|happy-ever-after]]. The overall experience is quite similar to driving several nails into your shins one by one.

== Characters == 

* '''Troy Bolton:''' He's the basket-ball [[faggot|jock]] hero and he's pretty, shiny and [[twink]]y, in order to appeal to [[12 year old girls]] and [[faggot|gay men]] (who are, actually, the same demographics). He's also 5'7, which is normal since he's [[white]] and [[Truth|white people are all short]]. He's the normal high school equivalent of the quarterback for [[shit nobody cares about|vague reasons]].  His popularity as a dwarf basket ball player comes from the fact that all other team members are just as small and white, since ''High School Musical'' has to be squeaky clean to appeal to [[fundamentalist|evangelicals]], and that [[niggers]] are, of course, unclean. He meets a girl, pretends to be [[breeders|heterosexual]] and tries to go out with her, [[moralfag|but not too hard because sex is dirty]]. In the end he learns a valuable life lesson about being himself, like in all Disney movies.

* '''Gabriella:''' A [[Mexican]] super-nerd who has an [[sarcasm|amazing]] singing voice. She’s pushed into joining nerd squads by her friends (because, you know, she's so shy and nerdy that she becomes the school's idol in about 6 seconds), instead of singing like she’s soooo good at and desperate to do. She meets a boy, and tries to NOT go out with him, because she's not a [[whore]] (unlike the actress playing her). In the end she learns a valuable life lesson about being herself, like in all Disney movies.

* '''Sharpay:''' The stuck-up spoiled [[attention whore]] valley girl played by [[Ashley Tisdale]]. She supposedly always gets the lead in the play beside her brother, which is slightly disturbing seeing as the main roles are usually [[incest|lovers]]. She's a conglomerate of [[Britney Spears]], [[Paris Hilton]] and [[homosexual|Kenny Ortega]] ([[not gay]]). She soon realises her mom is a [[Lesbian|Hippy]] when she is found doing [[masterbate|Yoga]].In the end she learns a valuable life lesson about being herself, like in all Disney movies.
 
* '''Ryan:''' The [[not gay]] twin brother. He loves to dance, prance around, say fabulous and sing with his dominatrix faghag. He's also blue eyed and blond, to make [[fundamentalist|evangelicals]] and other [[nazi]]s feel at home. Everyone older than 6 can tell right away that the character is meant to be gay - unfortunately, HSM's fanbase is ''not'' older than 6. Which gives in to the [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1727317/board/flat/121128833 lulz] and [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1727317/board/flat/92794975 lol]. He also LOVES fashion, and wears about [[666]] different hats over the three films. [[sarcasm|But that doesn't mean anything, because there are some straight people who also like fashion, like, Zac Efron]] (and it doesn't matter either that he was outed in HSM, the broadway musical). It is revealed in HSM3 that he is a [[furry]].  In the end he learns a valuable life lesson about being herself, like in all Disney movies.


There are also a couple token [[black]] characters, [[liberal guilt|to show that Disney cares]]. They, of course, begin dating because everyone knows that [[black people]] are only attractive to each other.

[[Image:Hsmpoolsclosed.jpg|thumb|right|Nice try, Disney. We all know [[AIDS|why the pool's REALLY closed]].]]

Because the first one wasn’t shitty and gay enough, [[Disney]] created a sequel. It's a High School Musical which doesn't happen during high school and has no musical in it, but who cares because Disney already cashed the check and had anal sex with the male actors. Instead, it takes place during summer time, because kids in Disneyland don't go on vacation or anything: they all stay together, cuz they're like, so BFF forever. They show off their [[crap| amazing musical skills]] in a  [[WTF|Country-Club "Talent"]] show. This movie is focused around how bitchy and controlling Shargay is, and how one day she’ll [[Britney Spears|shave her head]] because [[BAWW|Troy doesn’t love her]]. Also, for mature audience, it contains the biggest amount of homoerotic subtext ever found in a film, ever, which goes to prove the whole movies are just a big Disney private joke. 

===HSM2 in Fifteen Steps===

# The song Disney leaked [[at least 100 years ago]] before airing the movie so that every 8-year old could sing in rythm.
# How easy it is to find a summer job for you, your friends and their dog.
# Troy loses himself.
# Troy loses his friends.
# Troy loses his girlfriend.
# Troy [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL37snqMJx8 prances around a golf course] and makes the whole internet lulz.
# Troy [[gay|finds himself]].
# Troy finds his friends.
# Troy finds his girlfriend
# OMG THEY KISS!!!!!1111ELEVENTYONE111!!!!, seeing as they're now old enough, being 17 and all that. [[srsly|THIS IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE WHOLE FUCKING MOVIE]] because HSM is a romance
# A [[shit|melodramatic]] love song about faith and love ensues.
# [[Homosexual|Zac Efron]] prances around in capri shorts around a pool to say how great it is he found himself.
# [[Not gay|Zac Efron]] jumps in a pool and all the guys in the pool swim toward him. No, [[Truth|srsly]].
# ??????
# PROFIT!

===The [[Captain Obvious|subtle]] [[not gay|Homoerotic]] subtext===

* Ryan plays a pink piano in a pool. Not like [[Elton John]], at all. 
* Sharpay sings about "fabulous" stuff.
* Ryan does Yoga. 
* Ryan has a '''great''' relationship with his [[mother]]
* Ryan and the nameless-token-black-guy [[sex|sing and dance together]] with [[penis|bats]] then [[wtf|exchange their clothes]].
* The characters "find themselves". 

As with most movies, Disney tries to milk the dollar cow as much as they can, consequently, they’ve released over 5 different versions on DVD, all of which are currently available in [[Wal-Mart]]’s 5 cent bin. 

===The Second Coming of Miley Cyrus ===

<s><big>ZOMGGGG [[Miley Cyrus|MILEY CYRUS]] IS IN THIS MOVIE FOR 2 SECONDDDSS!!!1</big></s> Maybe so, but [[stfu]], [[12 year old girls|12 year old fancunt]].

== Oh [[Jesus]] Fucking Christ: HSM3 ==

[[Image:HSMbreeding.jpg|thumb|right|THEY'RE SPAWNING!]]

Yes, the [[shit|series]] continues. Seeing as HSM is the only thing [[Disney]]’s made in the past 30 years that anybody likes other than ''[[Miley Cyrus|Hannah Montana]]'', a third movie in the HSM saga was released in 2008, with a whole new world of amazing and original songs. The only good news was that they provided [[Vanessa Hudgens|Vanessa "Whore" "Obnoxious" Hudgens]]' character with a new singing voice. 

It is entirely composed of [[breeders|Troy/Gabriella]] duets, since it's what makes [[12 year old girls]] cream their pants because they want to be Gabriella. Other than that, other characters appear for at least 5 seconds each, and Troy [[whore|re-enacts Flashdance]] almost shirtless. Then there's prom. [[Portal|Then there's the song that says that they're going to make a 4th one]].
