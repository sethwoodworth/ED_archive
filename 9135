'''Wookieepedia''' claims to be a ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Wikia]] for [[canon]] information. It is so horrendously and geekily named that anything harboring a vagina will instantly burst into flames upon reading it. It is in fact secretly a parody site run by people who hate ''Star Wars'' and want to destroy it by replacing everything canon with non-canon information. Editors to the site replace everything from official movies and official games that most people have actually experienced with things from self-published ''Star Wars'' comics and books that no one has ever read. The official language of the site is [[engrish|galactic basic standard]].

===The worthless editors behind it===
Apart from [[Jimbo Wales]] and the other usual [[TOW]] people who just [[profit]] from these nerds' hard work, you will find:
*'''Adamwankenobi''' - Admitted pedo and former Wikipedia troll. 
*'''AdmirableAckbar''' - Is an actual vandal who due to being butt-buddy to sysop Darth Cristopher "The Kip" Keim Culator, got rollback status.  User never actually talks, just reverts -- boasts 2,000 edits on the site, but every one a revert.  As stated on userpage, the user is a 15 year old boy.
*'''Darth Culator''' ([http://thekip.blogspot.com Cristopher "The Kip" Keim]), the [[Michael Moore|fat]] [[fag|Dark Accountant]] of the [[Shit|Sith]]. He states on his userpage he keeps his monitor resolution at 1600 x 1200, but he actually only has a 14 inch monitor and from this his eyes have become so nearsighted he never leaves his parent's basement even though he is 26 years old.
*'''I need a name''' -- troll and vandal. Runs a bot that reverts any edit to user or talk page if it doesn't include an imitation of Jar Jar Banks and then the bot reverts every edit that user has made in less than a second.
*'''Jack Nebulax''', [http://starwars.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Jack_Nebulax LOL fired] (probably committed [[suicide]] after this. RIP motherfucker)
*'''[[Jack Phoenix]]''', the [[Chuck Norris|Jack-off all trades]].
*'''[[Kuralyov]]''' ([http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A22SHW2G3VNBSR Eddie Guimont]), [[communism|president of Proletaria]] and <s>admin of the site</s> PWNED.
*'''LtNOWIS''' is better known on AIM as simon23p, who is an infamous [[pederast|boylover]] and member of [[NAMBLA]].
*'''[[LucidFox|Sikon]]''' the [[uncyclopedia]]n, [[TOW|ED hater]], Ubuntu enthusiast and [[furry|Firefox]] lover, who has committed [[wikicide]] due to racial discrimination
*'''QuentinGeorge''', a sadistic, spiteful Austrhole (that is, an Australian asshole.) He tells people to commit suicide just to warm his black little heart. A rebellion is in motion to overthrow this sithy fuckface. Constantly at war with the Freedum Fiter Vandle.
*'''Redemption''' is the [[Photoshop|shop master]] of the site, and adds non-canon content all over the place, and reverts anything that actually is canon; is one of the biggest dicks on the wiki. 
*'''Naru Hina''' is the douchebaggy admin who controls the [[Knights of the Old Republic|KotOR]] section.  [[Internet Tough Guy|He's a sixteen year old who thinks he can boss everyone else around just because he's an admin.]]
*'''Riffsyphon1024''' (Steven Greenwood), aspiring geologist and WB's [[sockpuppet|sockpuppet, asslicker, et al]] 
*'''SFH''' is the current underage boyfriend of Silly Dan. Does quite literally nothing aside from applying welcome templates to the talk pages of new vandals and the occasional Ewok. Mistakenly assumed by many to be a bot for this reason.
*'''[[Silly Dan]]''' ([http://hep.physics.utoronto.ca/DanMacQueen/ Dan MacQueen]), Scottish, [[Canada|nerdy]], [[penis|PhD]] student of physics. He is also a pederast. On his LiveJournal account, he rants about how "all the ''Star Wars'' movies and games suck and the self-published comics that nobody reads are better."
*'''[[StarNeptune]]''' ([http://web.archive.org/web/20060216190537/http://starwars.wikicities.com/wiki/User:StarNeptune Jennie Cooper]), [[aspie|aspergian]] streetwalker, avid [[retard|fan]] of ''Final Fantasy'' and [[WTF|Hapan]] stuff.
*'''Thefourdotelipsis''' is a sysop who has had sexual relations with several of the underage boys on the site (especially Valin "Tnu" Shido). If you see an editor who is an asshole and the admins allow it, you can guarantee it's allowed because this guy got to sleep with him.
*'''WhiteBoy''' ([http://www.barbry.org Chad Barbry]), the White Supremacist founder of the site. He is also a KKK member IRL, seriously. He does no work on the site, gave the first ten people who stumbled on it full administrator access, and never came back.

All of these real names and e-mails they freely give out on the web and don't mind anyone knowing, except, of course they don't like them put on their wiki where they go batshit.

===Description===
Wookieepedia is the older bastard sister of the [[Star Wars Fanon Wiki]]. Preferred activities of Wookieepedia users:
*[[sex|Learn something considered to be unnatural]] (1%)
*[[nerd|Bash SuperShadow]] (14%)
*[[Masturbation|Jack off]] to Leia Organa or Bastila Shan - Not photos of Leia or pictures in-game of Bastila Shan, but crudely drawn art of them made for self-published comics nobody has read. (85%)

Wookieepedia was born thanks to the phenomenon known as "Lucascruft Purge" (many Wikipedians started to go rogue and frenziedly deleted everything concerning the ''Star Wars'' universe on Wikipedia while blocking those who contributed to ''Star Wars''-related stuff).

As the name suggests, the site is populated by Wookiees and furry people in general.

Wookiees are quite stubborn when it comes to replacing non-canon facts with [[canon]] facts: an editor will be banned for good if they post something that has any affiliation with that guy called SuperShadow, and will get a nice template with a white haired sexy chick, telling you that you have been "[[ban|exiled]]". Sometimes a [[bureaucratic fuck]] will tell the user to go screw the [[Star Wars Fanon Wiki|''Star Wars'' Wiki]] of [[crap|fanon invention]], where [[shit]] is accepted. The very same [[shit]], if written on this wiki, will earn you a long [[ban]]. However, some [[shit|fanon]] manages to slip in and stick for a while before some girl with [[Asperger's syndrome]] removes it.

Official shit which is approved by [[George Lucas|their supreme god]] will stick, no matter the crappiness of it.

===Trolling methods===

[[Image:Kuralyov.jpg|thumb|Troll this guy.]]

Every so often a user gets really mad at the site because any complaints about their abusive people gets blanked and ignored so the user will hit the "random article" button and replace articles with their complaint. If the person is mad enough, they will do googling and find the all the sysop's [[power word|power word: IRL name]]s and paste them along with it. That means the sysops have to manually delete an article and restore the revision without the power words. The fun happens when someone goes to [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Mostrevisions Special:Mostrevisions] and does it to the articles with several thousand revisions. When an article has thousands of revisions, it takes sysops hours to delete and restore a revision. For instance, [http://starwars.wikia.com/index.php?title=Jacen_Solo&action=edit&oldid=1754644 this bit of power word exposure] still remains in history. This is because nobody on Wookieepedia has Oversight. The way to troll is, of course, dig in recent changes for an editor who recently got mad at Wookiepedia and turned vandal, and then imitate that editor for weeks to come. Doing this assures them that they know that their site isn't just vandalized by people who are bored, but by people who truly wish to murder them [[IRL]].

Another fun way to troll is get them to blocking entire IP ranges or even whole countries for long periods of time by copycatting other vandals and by simply showing them they failed to keep you from editing. If a group of people get together and pretend to be the same person, they can get Wookieepedia to ban the entire world from editing.

==Typical shit==

[[Image:Kuralyov.jpg|thumb|Typical admin.]]

This is a typical day of how their administrators are 24/7/365.

In one instance, someone made a forum thread saying their administrators secretly hated ''Star Wars'' and so that person hated them, too, and it had no attempt to advertise any other site and no links or anything even resembling URLs, just a criticism of their wiki and the administrators (this time Cull Tremayne) instantly use a lie as the deletion reason falsely claiming it was "spam". [http://starwars.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=&page=Forum%3AEncyclopedia+Dramatica+tells+the+truth+about+this+wiki] The dial-up IP address that made the forum is also blocked 1 week by Gonk for "spamming to external sites".[http://starwars.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=Gonk&page=User%3A67.1.38.60]

The IP disconnects and reconnects his modem in 1 minute and an admin Greyman blocks the dialup IP for six months
[http://starwars.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=Greyman&page=User%3A67.1.33.192]. Then a dude called Graestan blocks the next IP forever [http://starwars.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=Graestan&page=User%3A67.1.39.31] and the IP changes it again and dude Graestan bans the IP address again [http://starwars.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=Graestan&page=User%3A67.1.33.158]. And all this time they don't seem to figure out that a simple redialing changes the IP forever.

For those that HAVE TO use broadband, they go on an open proxy to get around a block. That should go without saying. And using an identical username may tend to antagonize them more but it shows them that the vandal is a lot tougher than you want him to be! He uses ''Gluupwhore''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s counter-forcefielding technology to walk right through the "force-fields" (called '''blocks''' in slang parlance.)

==Wookiedrama==

[[Image:Kuralyov.jpg|thumb|Kuralyov on the turret, ready to snipe vandals.]]

'''Kuralyov''' ([http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A22SHW2G3VNBSR Eddie Guimont]) is a worthless <s>administrator of this site</s>LOL DENIED and [[unwarranted self-importance|full time president of an unknown nation named Proletaria]]. He is also an avid fan of "Pokey the Penguin" and ''Battlestar Galactica'' and is a proud member of the [http://www.mnn.mncentre.net/wiki/index.php/Proletarian_Democratic_Union Proletarian Democratic Union]. Kuralyov has more edits than [[SlimVirgin|this jew]] and shares similar views on how other editors should be treated. He is a sworn enemy of [[World of Warcraft|the Wook's bosses]] and of the [[moderator|mods]] at [[Star Wars|TheForce.net]].

Kuralyov is [[butthurt|extremely jealous]] of [[fake editor|his work]]. If you fuck with him, he might block your IP address at the application level for "". He also contributes to maintain the site in a neutral stance and strictly observes the [[Jimbo Wales|Jimbo]] Philosophy "Assume Bad Faith" towards [[newbie|n00bz]]. Kura is a fierce revert warrior and regularly breaks the 3RR. 

In May 2008 he went  [http://starwars.wikia.com/index.php?title=User:WhiteBoy/Kuralyov&diff=prev&oldid=1961400 batshit insane "BEEBLE BEEBLE BEEBLE"] and committed [[wikicide]] after threats of de-sysoping his account.[http://starwars.wikia.com/index.php?title=Wookieepedia:Requests_for_removal_of_user_rights&diff=prev&oldid=1961399.]
