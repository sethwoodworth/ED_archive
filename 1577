'''Charles Norris''' (real name: Mexican Ray Norris) is a rather boring karate champion, a dedicated [[christfag]], [[bear|hairy bear]], and star of ''Walker, [[Redneck|Texas]] Ranger'' which means he's a [[republican]].  Norris is also indirectly responsible for an [[old meme|old]] internet [[meme]], in which he was effectively elevated to the throne of [[internet tough guy|Ultimate Internet Tough Guy]] by a fucking bunch of nerds. He is a hero to many [[jock]] college students who haven't realized that their Chuck Norris jokes haven't been been humorous for years.  He also supported obese nutjob [[Mike Huckabee]] in the 2008 presidential election.

With nothing more than his bare hands and keen intellect, Chuck Norris has killed, maimed, and brutalized hundreds of Hollywood careers. After his fight scene with Chuck Norris, martial arts legend Bruce Lee [[death|died]]. Jonathan Brandis, who starred in Norris' ''Sidekicks'', was reduced to acting opposite a talking dolphin and became [[an hero]] when he was cut from ''[[shit nobody cares about|Hart's War]]''.

== Chuck Norris Facts: The Old, Dead, Unfunny Meme ==

'''Chuck Norris Facts''' is a prototypical [[old meme]] spawned by some fucking [[Neckbeard|neckbeards]] at [[Something Awful]], that most people grudgingly like.  Since Norris' old movies are based on the premise that he has a [[internet tough guy|superhuman ability]] to kick [[terrorists|dirty foreigner]] ass, the ''Facts'' exaggerate these lofty abilities to epic proportions. Years ago, there was a time everybody enjoyed Chuck Norris jokes. [[Me]], [[you]], and even [[ED]] itself. And as we look back on those times, we realize we were fucking retarded for ever doing so.

Chuck Norris' article at [[TOW]] once had the following [[fact|trivia]]:

* Chuck Norris' tears cure cancer. Too bad he's never cried. Ever.
* Evolution is a lie, there's just a list of animals Chuck Norris allowed to live.

These facts were removed because the editor failed to cite his sources. As time went on, skeptical [[fucktards]] began adding fictional "Chuck Norris Facts" to their own lists, joined by bored housewives and sports fans that embraced this new and [[unfunny]] meme.

If you were expecting this article to be filled with Chuck Norris jokes, too fucking bad.  If you really need to find some, just search [[The Google]].  Or kill yourself.  Google can help you find advice on doing that, too.

<big>'''Obligatory Examples'''</big>

* Before the [[Candlejack|boogeyman]] goes to sleep, he checks ''his'' closet to make sure Chuck Norris folded all the clothes correctly.
* Chuck Norris won't suck your dick for money; he will gladly do it for free.
* Chuck Norris doesn't do push-ups; he's [[truth|too old]].
* Chuck Norris ruins every party he goes to because he is a born again [[Christian]] [[fundie]].
* When Chuck Norris endorses a presidential candidate, it's [[Mike Huckabee]].
* Evolution is a lie; there's just a list of animals Chuck Norris believes were created by [[Raptor Jesus|our Lord God Almighty]].
* Chuck Norris once told Chuck Norris a Chuck Norris joke.  But Chuck Norris didn't laugh.  Because Chuck Norris jokes aren't funny.

==Chuck Norris has a lawyer and is [[Butthurt|suing Penguin]]==

==Chuck Norris "Facts"==
{{quote|Here's what I really think about the theory of evolution: It's not real. It is not the way we got here. In fact, the life you see on this planet is really just a list of creatures god has allowed to live. We are not creations of random chance. We are not accidents. There is a god, a creator, who made you and me. We were made in his image, which separates us from all other creatures.|Chuck Norris'', refusing to reveal the species he will kill off next ([[furries]]).}}

{{quote|There was a man whose tears could cure cancer or any other disease, including the real cause of all diseases â€“ sin. His blood did. His name was Jesus, not Chuck Norris.  If your soul needs healing, the prescription you need is not Chuck Norris' tears, it's Jesus' blood.|Chuck Norris'', refusing to cry for cancer patients.}}
