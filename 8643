'''Uber''', meaning "over" in German, is a widely used netspeak term popularized by [[Nazi]]s in their freaky game rooms. It is used in every [[Rammstein]] song. For example:
:Ich wünsche zu rüber Ihnen mag ein Tier.
:Ich wünsche zu über Ihnen vom Innere.
:Ich über Ihre Mannbohrung.
:Ich über Ihre Testikel.
''(Rammstein - Uber Ihre Testikel)''

Syphilitic German philosopher Friedrich Nietszche invented the concept of the ''Übermensch,'' or Superman, to describe the ideal leader of human society, a man who has achieved enlightenment and freed himself from unnecessary and outdated restrictions. The Nazis promptly applied this term to the robotically obedient followers of a [[Adolf Hitler|failed artist with a shit fetish]] .

=='''Über''' vs. '''Ueber''' vs. '''Uber''' ==
According to German [[Grammar Nazi]]s, '''über''' is the preferred form. The usage of '''ueber''' is acceptable. Please note, however, usage of '''uber''' makes [[BumpityBoo|you]] look like an illiterate fucktard that is worthy of the [[final solution]].

==Buffy [[fan]]s==
[[Joss Whedon]] popularized the prefix über among Buffy fans by using it to describe the villains in the final season of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. Since Buffy had already killed normal vampires, a goddess, and several boyfriends, he needed something nastier for the grand finale. In season seven, nearly-unslayable übervamps were the big bad and since then, Buffy fans add über to a wide variety of words and phrases. For example:
:My boss is an überjerk.
:I had to hose some über[[Christian]]s off my porch today.
:They canceled [[Firefly]] and I am überpissed.
