In the right hands the '''Ideas Wiki''' could have been [[lie|full of potential and purpose]]. Insted it lies in the hands of the internet, turning into a terrifying bastardization of [[livejournal]] and [[wikipedia]] run by [[Asspies]].

==The Fanbase==
The only real problem is a majority of it's users are teenagers with [[autism]] and [[retard|learning disabilities]], [[basement dwellers]], [[Chris-Chan]] wannabes,[[Tartlets]], and other [[freak|assorted people]], whose lives revolve around playing [[Kingdom Hearts]] and watching [[Power Rangers]], [[Cartoon Network]] and Disney Channel and believe that there should be more movies like ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]'', only lamer. 
Thus making it the most lulzworthy Wiki since [[Conservapedia]].
It is assumed most of the users who frequent the site had been banned from [[TOW]] after posting articles about their imaginary TV shows or just stuff that was so badly written and usually involving shit like Disney and The Chipmunks, that nobody could believe it was true. Several other users also post on [[DevianTART]] and [[FanFiction.Net]]. 

Recently, the site gained internet notority after [[SomethingAwful]] made a video about them (partically the batshit ideas of one [http://ideas.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/Magnus_User Magnus User].)
(located [http://www.somethingawful.com/d/flash-tub/idea-wiki-cartoon.php here]), because apparentlly they were too lulzy to have just a simple "Awful Link of the Day" article about them. 
It should be noted many of these users know very little about how the world works so, many of their ideas are just aspie ramblings and badly written nonsense.

==Trolling==
Judging by it's fanbase trolling IdeaWiki is retardedly simple:

<b>
*(Post on any talkpage of any article) "This is not an idea - this is an opinion."
*"And [[your argument is invalid|your opinion is stupid]]."
*"You only add to this wiki because your thousands of letters were rejected by the TV producers."
*"Why do you no ideas on how to fight terrorism / solve world hunger / prevent rape but have loads of ideas on [http://ideas.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Men_Show_Season_3 how to make season 3 of Mr.Men]?"
*"Aren't you worried that posting your ideas online will just make them easier to steal?" <small>(NOTE: Admittedly this isn't likely to happen. Having their [[bullshit|wonderful]] ideas stolen is about as likely as [[Chris-chan]] becoming president.)</small>
*"[http://ideas.wikia.com/wiki/Tombstone Didn't we see this idea on CSI?]"
* Ask them if they have any ideas that have nothing to do with Disney or the Muppets or The Chipmunks?
* Tell them that Disney no longer owns Power Rangers or Miramax!
* <s>Rewrite articles until they make sense.</s> Some things are just impossible.
* Tell them their ideas just don't work/suck/make no sense/will never happen!
