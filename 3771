Hott

{{needsmore|words}}
<br>
The [[Faggot]] spelling of "[[hot]]."  The extra "t" indicates that, without any fucking doubt, the subject matter at hand must be totally and undeniably [[slut|hot]]. Sincere use of said spelling is an indicator said user has never experienced any sexual gratification with anything "HOTT" [[IRL|in real life]]. See also: [[retard|totally retarded]]. 

It should be noted that the only ways virgins measure the worth of a woman is by her "hott"ness, and her [[sammich]] making ability, as they have never had their [[Oral_sex|dick sucked]] nor had a sandwich actually made for them by anyone but their mothers.

Like all Netspeak, escalation has created variants attempting to equate further levels of hotness/hotitude with increasing numbers of "t"s: c.f. NOES!!!!1!!11

If you're hawt enough, you may [[You win the prize|win a prize]].

People who use the term "HOTT" you are clearly [[pedophile]]s who like [[CP]], [[rape|raep]], [[buttsecks]] with small children and various other forms of bieng kiddy-fiddlers.


== You ==

[[You]] either came to this page to [[fap|masturbate]] to some nude or [[Fail|semi-nude]] [[Woman|tail]], meaning you are in the healthy majority of males (or the favored minority of [[lesbian|bisexual females]]!) who enjoy the female form, ''or'' you were directed here out of some kind of misplaced [[Fail|pity]]. 

Or, quite possibly, you were directed here because some [[loser]] in another topic thought something was "hott", [[you]] were enough of a [[loser]] to click the internal link, [[obvious|and here we all are]]. 

Most likely, [[obvious|you yourself are not hot]].

In any case, [[truth|all contributors to this page simply wanted an excuse to post a picture of a hot female]] ([http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Hott&action=history note the rush they were in with their sloppy spelling and odd grammar!]), so stop reading and get to it.
