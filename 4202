James M. Hardiman (AKA Jim Hardiman AKA Desire Lee) is a furry artist from [[before the internet|the early 90s]] who can't seem to get with the times.

==Once upon a time==

Hardiman was once a popular furry artist. He had it all. Constant fan mail, [[asspat|asspats]], his own web site, tons of [[whiteknight|fans]]. He specialized in the Loony Toons style and was a furry enthusiast. Unfortunately for him, the furry population began to grow, and more and more artists came into the picture, leaving Hardiman without any attention. Since these new kids with their [[superior|inferior]] art styles started [[piracy|stealing]] all his art from the internet, he's been severely [[butthurt|upset]]. In retaliation, he released a portfolio of some stupid [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|lizard chick]] raging in huge walls of texts at [[piracy|pirates]], [[pedophiles]], [[video games|video gamers]], [[nerds|nerds]], and [[internet tough guys|internet tough guys]].

Hardiman used to go under the alias of Desire Lee. Hardiman claims Desire Lee was a friend of his, and a fellow furry artist. The problem here is there is no information anywhere on Desire Lee outside of her supposed [[sockpuppetry|cooperation]] with Hardiman, and their identical styles.

Hardiman was once known for portraying [[pedophilia|underge cartoon characters engaging in sexual activities]] in his art while under his alias of Desire Lee. In later years, he released various images and portfolios against such content, probably to cover his own ass from being labled a full-fledged child molester.

Hardiman has released several portfolios. Most of them are just him bitching about newfangled trends, [[James_M._Hardiman|pedophiles,]] and [[piracy|piracy.]]
