Akinator
[[Image:Akinator 1 defi.png|thumb|right|220px|IT KNOWS]]

It knows who you are, it knows where you live, it knows where [[your mom]] sleeps. It is an obvious reason for [[paranoia]]. Better watch out, because Akinator is under your table.

'''Akinator''' is a serious case of [[Fuckin magnets|internet magic]], describing itself as a mere "web genius", even though we all know that this castrated [[muslim]] is a god. The website itself is like a web version of Twenty Questions - you think of something and this [[faggot]] out of a lamp tries to figure out who are you imagining. Of course, this is all [[retarded|boring]] until you understand - [[Damn|AKINATOR GUESSES IT RIGHT ALL THE TIME]]. Straight out, no exceptions. Either you click random answers like a hyperactive [[aspie]] or you think of an internet loser nobody ever gives a shit about - you always see it right in front of you. Some do not appreciate this [[Serious business|noble miracle]], and fearlessly [[ALL CAPS|exclaim]] that Akinator does make mistakes. Well, the truth is, it is [[you]] who can't answer the fucking questions right. [http://en.akinator.com/ Do it, homosexual]. It will [[Mindfuck|blow your brain]].

== But how? ==
[[Image:Akinator.PNG|thumb|left|220px|The answer is obvious.]]
Complex hacking and miracles, that's how. But actually, it's easy. By answering questions, you open up categories for Akinator to choose from. And eventually you dig deeper and deeper through those categories, resulting in the ultimate guess. However, to know what categories to actually go to, the genie has to be [[1337|"programmed"]] by users themselves - that is why it is so important to Akinator whether he guessed it right or not, and if not, who we were actually looking for. So yeah, Santa doesn't actually exist.

== Oh, manipulatable ==

And the best thing is, all of the characters there are added by users. With that said, the possibilities are endless. Add [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] users, add yourself, add your dick. And since it is likely nobody will ever be thinking of the last two things ([[Dying alone|nobody is interested in you and your dick]]), you can get to another great thing - bombing. Simply get the genie to guess someone that is guessed frequently (check the fucking stats) and, in the end, click "No". When you will be asked to input what you were actually [[Child porn|thinking of]], feel free to write your dick here. Repeat this for a few thousand times and Akinator may be [[Divide by zero|broken]] by now.
