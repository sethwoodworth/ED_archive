'''ADHD''' and "ADD," which stand for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Attention Deficit Disorder respectively, are two formerly popular propaganda terms used by the parents of [[stupid]] children, teachers who can't do their jobs, and white collar drug dealers known as doctors who almost always work with/for the the pharmaceutical industry, the biggest and most powerful drug cartel in the world for [[at least 100 years]] now.  While it is true that there are a lot of [[retards]] out there who cannot converse beyond the third grade level and whose inner lives very closely resemble an average episode of [[Family Guy]], top scientists and researchers at the [[Church of Scientology]] have [http://books.google.com/books?id=gjojY1WoIOIC&pg=PA4&lpg=PP6&output=html proven by lawsuits] that ADHD is not really a disease and that Ritalin is really just a form of mind control. [[Some argue]] ADHD was invented by [[Americunts]]

== History ==

In its heyday, ADHD was the kewlest disease on [[teh internets]], and its "sufferers" were everywhere, much like Asspies and OCDers are today, and like them the source of endless lulz.   Because ADHD is basically just the medical term for [[stupid]], any [[troll]] with even a modicum of [[skill]] could easily whip an ADHDer into a crazy [[retard]] frenzy which if done properly would be so funny as to actually cause physical damage by the megalulz unleashed.  The Golden  Age of ADHD ended when all the "sufferers" got sick of faking, OD'd on their drugs, re-diagnosed themselves with  [[Asperger's Syndrome|Asparagus Syndrome]] or became [[Indigo Children]] to keep up with retard fashion.  Now it is rarely encountered, having passed into history like the bubonic plague.  Even when a lone survivor (i.e. one too [[Dyslexia|lysdexic]] to read the writing on the wall) shows up, all the normal people are usually too bored to get any serious lulz out of them. 

== Symptoms ==

The symptoms of ADHD are (or were, when it still existed) very similar to those of the closely related [[Asperger's Syndrome|Asparagus Syndrome]] and [[Dyslexia|Lysdexia]].  They include:

*Inability to get jokes.
*Use of memes that have been obsolete for [[Irony|at least 100 years]] in the mistaken belief that this will help you fit in with the normal people.
*Constantly telling everyone all about your [[stupid]] [[attention whore|fake]] [[disease]].
*[[Drama|Violent outbursts]] and generally acting retarded.  
*Blaming it on your [[attention whore|fake]] [[disease]]. 
*Incessant wanking about how your [[attention whore|fake]] [[disease]] makes you [[I_have_a_140_IQ|smarter]] than everyone else.  (Slight difference here.  ADHD makes you a [[genius]] because you can multitask.  Ass-burgers makes you a genius because you can't.  Dyslexia makes you a genius because you spell it "mlutitaks". Lulz aside, none of these diseases have such an effect; the mistake is made because autism has a side effect of [[OH NOES|making you a genius, in exchange for taking away your emotions, making you a robot]].)
*Claiming that Thomas Edison and [[Einstein]] had your [[stupid]] [[attention whore|fake]] [[disease]], and thus that you are part of the [[genius]] [[master race]].
*[[BAWWW|BAWWWING]] when anyone but you calls your [[disease]] a "disease".  ''("It's NOT!  It's ZMOG!MADE OF AWESOME!  Thomas Edison!  Einstein!")''  See also: [[Denial]].
*[[BAWWW|BAWWWING]] when they don't.  
*Writing [[fan fiction]].
*Expecting to be worshiped for any minor accomplishment, like spelling your own name and tying your shoelaces, because of [[Meaningless noise|your disease which isn't a disease and is terrible and also awesome and makes you unable to do anything and better than everyone else ''all at the same time'']].

ADHDers stand out from other species of [[mouth-breather]] mainly by their fetish for bringing up the fact  that they are on [[drug|DRUGS]], just like a [[Tom Cruise|movie star]], and telling dramatic stories about their drug adventures.  Typical ADHD conversational phrases are: ''"Wait, I need to drop some Ritalin," "I think the Ritalin's kicking in,"'' and ''"Last night I was on so much Ritalin that I had 84 seizures and my heart stopped beating for nearly 10 minutes.  It was awesome!"''

This is supposed to make them sound [[cool]]  and impress normal people with their [[sob story|courage]], but fails because only [[losers]] take prescription drugs.

== Prescription Drugs for Losers ==
* Ritalin: An attempt at a chemical hybrid of cocaine and amphetamine. It doesn't sting, doesn't makes the throat numb, and isn't much fun because it's so bland.

* Amphetamines (Adderall, Dexedrine): Helps restore alertness and is as safe as coffee; equal to about 2 cups of coffee. Truckers and fighter pilots swear by it, but you will get your ass kicked if you try to sell it to the local biker gang as speed.

* Cylert/Pemoline: What the doctor prescribes if he is [[lazy|unwilling to do the DEA paperwork]] that comes with prescribing something else.

* Vyvanse: The very newest ADHD drug approved by the [[The Man|FDA]]. It's really just amphetamine, but its chemically bonded to [[crap|lysine]] so it takes longer to start. Lysine was chosen because according to the movie '''Jurassic Park''', [[you|genetically modified dinosaurs]] love it.

== Fake vs Real: The Pointless Controversy ==

Like [[Asperger's Syndrome|Asspies]], [[Dyslexia|lysdexics]] and [[Tourette's Syndrome|Touretters]], ADHDers will (or did, before they became extinct) froth at the mouth at any suggestion that they might actually be fully-functioning human beings like everyone else.  This is because all these [[retard|loids]] labour under the misconception that they will finally get respect if they can only prove their brains are fucked-up '''''FOR REALZ.'''''  Few of them ever wake up to the fact that normal people despise [[attention whores]] and genuine [[retards]] ''equally''.  Those who do usually prefer to be known as [[Indigo Children]], which they don't realize is just the [[R word|latest euphemism]] for [[retarded]].

== ADHD in daily life ==

Some people who think they have attention disorders are quite good at [[video games]] despite their epic lulz retardation, and also occasionally at the [[real life]] counterpart, which is called <s> sports</s> [[violence]]. For this reason, it is important that one only mock them on teh webs and not IRL as these people, like many other species of retard, often develop super retard strength when agitated and can tear you to shreds if they get their hands on you. The comic book and movie series ''The Hulk'' is partially based on this well-known phenomenon.

Apart from this they are totally useless for all purposes except, according to some people, sex (see below).  This does not stop many ADHDers from [[Bullshit|claiming mad skills]] in philosophy, number theory, computer science, mathematical logic, abstract calculus, pharmaceutical chemistry, literary theory, theoretical physics, structural linguistics, criminal law and pretty much anything else you can easily lie about on [[teh internets]].  Tragically, some of them are deluded enough to believe their own fantasies, because their mothers, teachers and other known liars keep telling them that having the [[I'm so random|attention-span of a goldfish]] somehow makes them more intelligent than normal hyooman beings.  This is of course baseless propaganda.

== Treatment ==

According to the ADHD propaganda machine, the best way to "cure" the [[stupid]] of this "disorder" is to pump them full of [[drugs]], mostly Ritalin and Valium and drugs like that, though these are often more expensive and less effective methods than parenting as has been amply demonstrated on ''[[South Park]]'' or more controversially by stop feeding them sugary drinks and candy, as just because it says 'sugar-free' on the side of the Cola bottle doesn't mean if those little darlings drink a gallon of it each, that their not going to bounce around like pinball on speed. 

However some say Ritalin and Valium are not actually medicine and should only be used recreationally. Neither of these methods work all that well, however, simply because there ''is'' no cure for [[stupid]].

Fortunately, nearly all ADHDers eventually graduate from their kiddie cocaine to the [[drug|real thing]], at which point they may become (more of) an arrogant selfish prick.
Another treatment is to rape a [[16 year old girl]], and then buy a gun, load gun with ammo, point gun at head and pull the trigger.

== Sex, ADHD & You ==

Some [[retard]]s argue that the best thing about ADD/ADHD, aside from the lulz they can be milked for, is that any chick who thinks she has ADD/ADHD has a high probability of being a [[slut]] and can easily be convinced that she should let you put your penis inside her. That is bullshit, since there is a good chance that [[you]] won't be able to keep her interested long enough to get past 2nd base. But don't despair, for this is probably as far as [[you]] can ever hope to get anyway. Besides, if they reject your first offer of cock, you can just ask them again five minutes later and may get a different response. If that doesn't work [[rape]] is always an option, as halfway through getting pounded they might forget that they never gave you consent in the first place (too bad you probably can't last that long). On the other hand, they might just as easily forget that they had consented, assuming, [[Latin|per impossibile]], that anyone would ever engage in consensual sex with the likes of [[you]] in the first place.

They also argue that spotting these chicks IRL requires looking for the ones who: 1) laugh at your stupid jokes and 2) don't notice how little you are listening to their scatterbrained blabbering. However, that is also bullshit, since 1) and 2) apply to 90% of all women populating singles bars.
