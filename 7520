'''Simon Belmont''' is perhaps the [[E-fame|most beloved Belmont of all]] "[[Castlevania]]" fanboys (mostly fags due to his [[Steroids|muscle mass]]). Appearing in the first version, Simon is most famous for defaeting Count Dracula by literally whipping his ass with the fabled [[Vampire]] Killer. However, since [[Konami]] ripped off every part of this franchise
from [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Gentleman]] Bram Stoker, this little-known fact makes Simon a rip-off from [[Shit nobody cares about|Van Helsing]].

== Background ==
[[Image:Belmontfamilyreunion.jpg|thumb|right|The one on the right is Simon. But who's the black person in the back?]]
According to the [[Bible|storyline]], Simon is the decendant of [[Old|Leon Belmont]], the first ass to wield the whip. Simon is also the great-great grandson of [[Pussy|Trevor Belmont]] and [[trap|transsexual witch Sypha]]. He is also [[What is a man|Richter's]] great great [[Pimp|granddaddy]].

In the original [[NES]] and later SNES games, Simon was drawn as a juiced-up muscular [[Nazi|blonde blue-eyed]] macho man ([[COOL STORY BRO|this was the stereotype for male superheroes back in the 80's and 90's]]) unafraid of anything that has to do with [[Satan]] cuz like any other Belmont, Simon was a [[Sarcasm|good]] [[Christian]]. After Super Castlevania IV, however, the games featured a different, [[fag]]gier [[Fail|Simon with red hair and a lisp]], proof that Konami [[I DID IT FOR THE LULZ|is only fucking up Castlevania for the money]].

==Games==
"Castlevania" wouldn't be famous without Simon, and this is true. However, Castlevania has been nothing but a cashcow for Konami lately. ED will give you the list of the earlier, humbler days of Castlevania games where our hero Simon starred in:


==='''Castlevania'''===
[[Image:Vinewhip.gif|thumb|right|The plot of the game, as [[Pokemon|Ivysaur]] shows you.]]
Also known as "'''[[Engrish|AKUMAJOU DORAKURA]]'''" in [[Japan]], it was the first to be released for the NES and FamiCom.
The plot was simple: [[You]] played as Simon, wield the Vampire Killer, whip the shit out of [[zombie]]s witches and skeletons, eats hearts and [[chikins]] hidden in [[WTF|walls and candles]], and watch out for those fucking [[Batman|bats]] and medusa heads, which are annoying as you are when asking someone out. If you managed to do this you encounter Dracula. After beating him the game starts all over again. The only way to beat it completely is by playing it for [[over 9000]] times while using only the Stopwatch. DO IT FAGGOT!!!

==='''[[AVGN|Castlevania II:Simon's (Shitty) Quest]]'''===
Supposedly Simon gets cursed by Dracula after defaeting him. No moar words about this piece of shit. Why don't you watch the reviews from these perma-virgin basement-dwellers below...

Now this is where things are probably really fucked up. In this [[cartoon]] produced by the [[sarcasm|wonderful]] world of [[dick|Dic]], Simon is a [[gay|flamboyant]], macho-man blonde who acts like a cowardly [[pussy|bitch]] whenever the villains show up. [[last Thursday|In one episode]], he is seen getting sneaked up on, and is shortly [[fail|kidnapped]] when a bag is put over his head, which makes anyone wonder if the [[fucktard|fucktards]] who created this shitfest have even played the games, let alone done any proper research. Oh, and did we mention that [[Kramer|HE'S A NIGGER]]?!

===[[Epic|Super Castlevania IV]]===
The first Castlevania released for the SNES. It features a much moar improved gameplay control on Simon: Now you can whip in eight different directions and can [[Michael Jackson|moonwalk]] on the stairs. Although it had an addition of some other useful shit, SCV4 has been one of the most controversial Castlevanias among fanboys. Always asking "Is it a sequel?" "Is it a remake?", who the fuck knows? (Or cares?) Apparently SCV4 also avoided flamewars about religion, with the intro having a tombstone with a cross PWNED by lightning. [[4Kids|Nintendo of America]] removed these images to avoid butthurt [[Christians|Christfags]] [[BAW]]WWING. They also removed and recolored blood from Stage 8 and dressed the topless statues in Stage 6 even though [[LOL|they failed to cover the nude Medusa]]. SCV4 is also known for it's improved graphics and designs, with a stage that [[PARTY HARD|imitates 3-D]] that can make any [[Azn]] [[Porygon|people fucking vomit]]. Unfortunately, [[YouTube|LesTubes]] feature lowlifes and ex-convicts filming and uploading their shitty playthroughs, fucking the greatness that was once Super Castlevania IV.

[[File:Simon-belmont.jpg|thumb|right|So not gay by Castlevania standards.]]

===[[Shit|Castlevania Chronicles]]===
Another remake of the original for the PSX. Needless to say it sucks due to the fact that not only Konami fucked up the controllers back to the NES ones, Simon looks moar like a faggy-ass white version of [[Prince]]. <s> This game also features the meme [[What is a man]]?</s> Wrong fucktard that's SotN.

===[[Epic Fail|Castlevania Judgment]]===
A [[violence|fighting game]] featuring a bunch of Castlevania characters going head-to-head, where they were barely recognizable among [[retards|fans]], in which major [[butthurt]] ensued. Aside from the [[shitty]] controls and horrible voice acting, all of the characters were [[doing it wrong|redesigned]] by [[Death Note|Takeshi Obata]], thus half of them [[USI|resembled his own characters]], most notably Simon who looks like [[batshit insane|Light Yagami]] on steroids, complete with a gay male-stripper outfit. [[Some argue]] that this is his worst design to date.
