Hockey
[[Image:Hockey 03.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Hockey circlejerk.]]

'''Hockey''', or ''Thugs On Ice'' is a [[truth|recognized, contact sport]] played on a [[WTF|rock hard sheet of ice]] while using [[fail|shoes with blades strapped on the bottom]] to glide at high speeds. The game is much like Capture The Flag, in that each team takes turns trying to run the "flag" (in hockey's case, a thick, hard disc made of [[science|vulcanized]] rubber) into the opposing team's zone, (in this case "the net"), without losing consciousness or teeth. 

Though the National Hockey League (NHL) is played in both [[Canada]] and America, every player is Canadian (even the [[black]] one) and hockey is Canadia's national pastime, (and -as such- is the leading cause of Canadians being called '''"Hockey Pucks"''').

Meanwhile, in America, hockey is the official sport of [[shit nobody cares about]]. This was demonstrated to effectively during the [[buzzkill|strike-canceled]] season of a year nobody can remember when [[nobody cares|nobody noticed]] that nobody was playing or reporting about hockey.

Hockey isn't a sport, it's a combination of three activities. The first being ice skating, second being golf and third being a fist fight (unless you are [[Cindy Crosby]], then it is a punch to the taint). Players skate while using a golf club-like device (called a [[cock|stick]]) to control the motion of the puck into the opposing team's goal, or a spectator's teeth.

Each city is just as big on their own team, like any other sport. However, some teams are quite important:
*[[Pittsburgh|Monroeville]] [[Zombie]]s
*San Jose Sharks, if only for the lulz.
*[[Pittsburgh]] Penguins - Cindy Crosby the Stagediver provides much lulz.
*Toronto Maple Leafs - As they're the team who hasn't won a Stanley in the longest time. Thus the biggest [[failures]] in the sport.

== The rules of Hockey ==

[[File:Canadian joke.png|thumb|hehe]]
*Referees wear striped shirts and jump really high. Try not to beat them while in a fight.
*Don't fake an injury/tripping too often, you'll be called a [[Cindy Crosby|faggot]].
*After each call a face-off will be had at any 9 locations on the "rink".
*Goalies should be rammed into head-first at any given opportunity. If you knock them into the "cage", extra points are awarded to your team.
*Most games end in something called "Sudden Death", where the score continues, and will end, 0-0.
*Helmets are to be worn at all times, should you get a razor-sharp skate to the head it will cushion the blow.

The game itself has [[PMS|3 periods]], each lasting a [[The Man|regulated]] [[No more than 99|twenty minutes]]. Should a stalemate be reached, Overtime will commence. Should a stalemate continue, a shootout will take place. 

Power Plays occur when a team has more players than the opposition, either due to a Jew or not having a goalie, often seen in Sudden Death.
