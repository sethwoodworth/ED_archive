Asexual

'''Asexuals''' (not to be confused with [[Homosexuality|Ass-sexuals]]) are people defined as as having [[Asian|limited sexual attraction]], or none at all (or they're simply sick of not being able to get any by age 30). While at first this may seem unusual, one must consider that the world is filled with [[pedophiles]], [[furries]], [[camwhore]]s, [[heterosexual]]s, [[homosexuals]], [[bisexual]]s, [[Hitler]], [[metrosexual]]s, [[arborphil]]es, and [[Japan]]ese, just to name a few. It's surprising that more people do not opt out of trying to decide if the person touching them was getting fucked the night before by an underaged badger/meerkat furry while swinging from a tree with carrots jammed at unnatural angles into his Abercrombie&Fitch pants.  Also, like the [[homosexual|gay homosexuals]] and the [[bisexual]]s and those filthy stinking [[heterosexual]]s, they claim it's not a "lifestyle choice" but just the way they are. 

Since their genitalia still works, they can often be found fapping solely to stimulate the pleasure center of their self-admitted disordered brain. This is excluding bacteria, as well as the rare asexual who is without any genitalia. You may be asking yourself, "why do they still bother to live"? The answer is just to annoy [[you]].

==Asexual existence==
[[poser|People who give up on sex slowly become asexual over time, simply because they just can't get it.]] This is because they are ugly as sin, and may just claim their asexuality to prevent any [[butthurt]] when asked if they have gotten laid yet. Anyone who's been [[basement dweller|alone]] for too long may become one for example. Over time, that person even get bored of their [[porno]], so even that twin-cocked hermaphrodite tiger isn't fappable to them anymore.

Most real asexuals will not admit to the fact that they lack raging hormones. When an asexual tells their parents they are asexual, their parents will assume that they are [[gay]] and trying to [[closeted|cover it up]]. The most feared consequence is that the asexual's platonic romantic interest would reject them, or that they would be inevitably cock-blocked by someone who is almost always erect. Some asexuals go to the next level to hide their disease and, in a fit of denial, become [[Suicide_Girls|strippers]] or engage in lavender marriages.

===Reasons Pretend to be Asexual===
*Your [[Penis|peen0r]] is too small.
*You're a [[pussy]].
*You're actually [[gay]], yet don't want to admit to it.
*You need an excuse for being a [[virgin]] all your life.
*You're [[ugly|physically displeasing]].
*Your favorite OS is [[Dumb|Gentoo]] or [[Crap|Arch Linux]].
*You're actually a [[furry]] and don't want to admit to it.

If you need a good excuse for what you do, this is what asexuality has to offer so it's a good deal if you're [[Kimmo Alm|running a pedophilia forum and never leaving the house]], and [[you]] should try it sometime.

===Actual Causes of Asexuality===
*[[Tentacle Rape]]
*Emotional Abandonment
*Child Abuse
*[[Brainwashing]]
*[[Brain]] Injury/ Lobotomies
*[[Autism]]

==Asexual traits==
Asexuals tend to replace [[sex]] with other pursuits, such as [[anime]] fandom, [[obsess]]ing over the lives of celebrities, [[Scientology]], [[Chanology|Scientology bashing]], [[eating disorder]]s, backgammon, and [[furfaggotry|cats]].

Despite finding the [[internets]] a coalescing force akin to [[furries]] and [[pedophiles]], asexuals somehow manage to be moderately productive and/or noteworthy members of society (see [[Martha Stewart]]), but have a tendency to become [[butthurt|upset]] when reminded they're only pretending to be asexual because [[fugly|nobody would have sex with them anyway]].

[[Image:Girlwithcake.jpg|thumb|[[The_cake_is_a_lie|Cake]] is the most accepted symbol of asexuality, because it is [[lie|more fun than sex.]]]]
Asexuals refer to themselves as "Ace" to show how hip and cool it is to be a 40-year-old virgin. Even though they don't want sex, asexuals can still enter romantic relationships with other people. Then again, this defeats the whole point of having a relationship, [[amirite]]? Even more, some asexuals [[irony|have sex]] or [[fap]] because, even though their hormones don't function normally, their dicks certainly do.

==Asexuals OTI==
On the Internets, it is required by asexual law that every asexual must have an account on the [http://www.asexuality.org/en/index.php? Asexual Visibility and Education Network], a place where Asexuals talk about their daily routines. In other words, doing fuck all and whining on a forum because they can't be social [[irl]]. It is here that they add more meanings to the term asexual - according to AVEN, hetero-asexuals and homo-asexuals exist too. This means they will go out with people yet will never fuck, ever. That's sort of like [[Sad|Internet relationships]] but in real life; they will just complain about how their life is boring, yet won't do a thing about it.

=="Sexuals" and their Delusions==
Asexuals are chronically misunderstood by those they call [[sex|sexuals]]. Most sexuals are either convinced that asexuality is the same thing as [[nuns|celibacy]], or fully believe that the person in question is [[dickgirl|capable of asexual reproduction]]. Sexuals refuse to accept that not all asexuals abstain from sex, not realising that asexuality reflects feelings rather than actions.

==The Jesuits==
The Jesuits are an asexual's worst enemy - they are dangerous [[British]] [[Catholic]] [[Gangster]]s and also go by the name of the [[Lemon Party|Society]] of [[Jesus]]. The Jesuits deny asexuality's existence, making asexuals all over the [[UK]] feel the need to defend themselves. However, being hardcore and all, the Jesuits recruit [[niggers]] so you should be extremely careful around this infamous terrorist group.

{{quote|Question: What do you call a person who is asexual? Answer: [[Truth|Not a person]]. [[Tl;dr|Asexual people do not exist. Sexuality is a gift from God and thus a fundamental part of our human identity. Those who repress their sexuality are not living as God created them to be: fully alive and well. As such, they're most likely unhappy people with which to live.]]|Christfags telling it like it is for once}}

Ironically, there are Biblical figures, such as the apostle Paul, who never married and expressed no interest in doing so. Despite it being obvious that their god has no problem with Paul's celibacy, they still condemn asexuality. Apparently, having little to no interest in sex is [[bullshit|exactly the same]] as homosexuality, and should be condemned as such.

Also, it should be noted that the Jesuits invaded [[EDF]] sometime in May 2010.

==Notable asexuals==
[[Image:Azuzephrefaggot.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ugly|Azuzephre]] IRL]]
There are a lot of articles about asexuals on our beloved ED, which will give you a decent idea of what happens to people who stay in their basements for too long or just why they have never, ever gotten laid. You will also notice that they are either [[furries]], [[autistic|mentally disabled]] or [[weeaboo|anime fantards]]. You're next.
