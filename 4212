[[Image:Jammno.jpg|thumb|Jammno telling his sad and terrible emo-story]]
Jammno is believed to be a [[World of Warcraft]] gaming god. 

== How it all started ==
[[Image:Teeth.jpg|thumb|left|Oh no! Dark times are rising while Jammno's teeth watch over from Mordor.]]
It began when Jammno posted on the high-faggotry levels containing WoW Forums. The image was literally telling people that he has no life, and should be shot on sight. He will pay you any price for getting a girl for him, which is highly unlikely. But, gods get fooled sometimes, as he thinks that he really can get help from the WoW forum that is filled with pimply-faced, maladjusted pre-teens, and there are no girls on the [[Internets]].

== Jammno's teeth ==
With great power comes great responsibility, as they say; So Jammno is forced to suck [[rock|rock hard dicks]] to be [[fag|a great WoW player]]. Thus, Jammno's teeth are exceptionally [[shitting dick nipples|horrible]]. Is there a dentist for WoW gods?

== Conclusion ==
Although being a WoW gaming god, nobody cares about him. His sad life has generated quite high levels of [[lulz]] around the [[Internets]]. He should get [[LJ|therapy]].

== Current Whereabouts ==
Jammno is currently annoying the everliving piss out of the residents of Oceanic realm [http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html;jsessionid=0F0B82F17ECC2087988CE9746E131715?forumId=11146&sid=1 barthilas], where his claims to greatness generally fall on def ears, since everyone is generally over his inane shit.

== Recent (ish) Update ==
In 2008, Jammno was said to have gone to a salon for a hair cut. Stylist asking what he wanted, he stated "A hair cut that will get me laid." Thus getting highlights and style, apparently got sum a week later.
