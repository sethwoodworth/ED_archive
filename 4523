Keeshaun was a character developed as part of a series of [[trolling]] sessions made to the Linksys customer service live chat system [http://linksys--chat.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/linksys.cfg/php/enduser/chat.php found here]. This is one of the less popular [[trolling]] types seen posted on e/b/aums, but has produced [[epic]][[lulz]] consistently for those willing to wait in line for their go at it. Keeshaun was interacting with customer service representative Bernhard A. who seemed hesitant to talk about his love life, or comment on the [[homosexual|threesome]] Keeshaun took part in. It is likely most of the victims that night were Indians, and had little or no clue what the fuck was going on. Later, other e/b/aums posters attempted to troll Bernhard A. with varying amounts of win and fail. Several other [[memes]] are mentioned with in this [[trolling]] session, a key element of any successful [[raid]]. Other [[memes]] mentioned included [[divide by zero|Oh shi-]], as well as [[9000|over 9000]], and also that "it's not gay if balls don't touch". The [[trolling]] was well received, and soon archived for generations of [[Fox News|hackers on steroids]] to learn from.
