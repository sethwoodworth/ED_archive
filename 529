{{TOCright}}

'''[[Faggot|Anonymous]]''', in addition to being responsible for 85% of all quotes ever cited, is the source of [[no more than 99|91%]] of all [[Internet]] [[truth]] and [[great justice|justice]] and [[Leeroy Jenkins|32.33 (repeating of course)]], and our daily dosage of Vitamins /b/ and [[Lulz]]. Anonymous is void of human restraints, such as pity and mercy. Those who [[faggot|perform reckless actions]] or [[fucktard|oppose Anonymous]] will be [[pwnd|eliminated]]. [[Fail]]ure is not tolerated. [[Scientology|Enemies]] are to be dealt with swiftly and efficiently. Anonymous must work as one. Anonymous is everyone and [[noone]]. [[You]] are. I am. Everyone is. Anonymous is [[human|humanity]] when the gloves come off. Anonymous is legion and its deeds are legend. What most people do not see in anonymous is that they do not go up against Scientology because of their ways, nor do anonymous do anything else for a valid reason. Anonymous in itself is a free-joining attention seeking "cult" as it may be referred to. They go up against Scientology so that they attract attention, [[moar]] people join, they become more confident and repeat. Anonymous is the only [[immortal]] [[troll]] on the [[internet]], which means they will '''[[never]]''' be [[banned]].

Anonymous is infinity divided by 0.= Syntax error.

Anonymous is not [[User:Anonymous|a person]], [[IVG|nor is it a group]], [[Anonymous Borg|movement]] or [[Chanology|cause]]: Anonymous is a collective of people with too much time on their hands, a commune of human thought and useless imagery. A gathering of sheep and fools, [[assholes]] and [[trolls]], and [[NORP|normal everyday]] netizens. An anonymous collective, left to its own devices, quickly builds its own society out of [[rage]] and [[Internet_Hate_Machine|hate]]. Anonymous can be anyone from well-meaning college kids with highly idiosyncratic senses of humor trying to save people from Scientology, to devious nihilist hackers, to clever nerds, to thirteen year old boys who speak entirely in in-jokes on an endless quest for porn, to [[16 year old girls]] posting pictures of their B-cups because they think they look good, to potential rapists browsing through [[MySpace]] to find some [[16 year old girls]] posting pictures of their B-cups because they think they look good. Furries are not included among the ranks of Anonymous due to their supreme [[faggot]]ry. For this same reason all [[furfags]] are destroyed within .666 seconds of facing the power of Anonymous

Anonymous is not so much unlike other web communities, it has in-[[joke]]s, culture, [[flame wars|extended debates]], etc, just like everyone else. Well, anyone stupid enough to join a web community. The difference, and the reason they visit other communities is that Anonymous have a need to be harassed by "nannying" [[mod|moderators]]. They hate being denied late night sleepovers. Here, there isn't anyone to do that - yet long and productive edit wars spring up at about the rate you'd never tolerate elsewhere, on topics you'd never believe. They have no leader, no pretentious douchebag president or group thereof to set in stone what Anonymous is and is not about. This makes them impossible to control or organize. Not really a collective at all - more like a stampede of coked-up [[lemmings]]. They don't dare to lead for will but rather break the "'''bridge'''" instead. And since it's all made out of Legos, fuck it.

Starting as an in-joke itself, "Anonymous" is the name assigned to a poster who does not enter text in the [Name] field on [[chan]] imageboards. Anonymous is not a single person, but rather, represents the collective whole of [[the internet]].

As individuals, they can be intelligent, rational, emotional and empathetic. As a mass, a group, they are devoid of humanity and mercy. Never before in the history of humanity has there once been such a morass, a terrible network of the peer-pressure that forces people to become one, become evil. Welcome to the soulless mass of blunt immorality known only as the Internet. 

The first rule of Anonymous is you do not talk about~ [Anonymous].

==Message to [[Fag|New Anon]] From [[Fag|Old Anon]]==
[[Image:AnonymousvsNewfagVert.jpg|thumb|right|This is what newfags actually believe.]]
[[Image:OldVsNewAnonTruth.gif|thumb|right|What actually happened to Anonymous.]]

Typical [[tl;dr]] by an Oldfag, AKA Veteran basement dweller, who for some insipid reason feels a sense of elitism about his place in [[/b/|the ocean of piss]]. Note the hypocrisy in attempting to identify something that is by definition unidentified.
 
[[Internet tough guy|People these days seem to think we are some sort of Internet vigilante group, That couldn't be further from the truth.

We are the little voice in the back of your head that wants to fuck your hot sixteen year old daughter. We are the father who beats his six year old child simply because he spilled his beer. We are every chef that's ever spit in some random person's food for the hell of it. We are the pyromaniac who burns down the homeless shelter for shits and giggles. We are the person who rapes the same girl twice. We are that feeling you get when you beat your pets; and enjoy it.

We see some guy hang himself live, we laugh. A wrestler kills his family, we laugh. Some maladjusted Asian shoots up his university, we laugh. Fifty-thousand die in North Korea, we laugh. AIDS ravages a continent, we laugh. An Austrian man locks his daughter in his basement for 24 years and fathers 8 children with her, we laugh. A religion invented by a psychotic writer swindles countless gullible fucktards out of their cash, we laugh, and then go kick his religion's ass just for the hell of it.

We aren't some vigilante group righting wrongs. We aren't your friends, your buddies or your saviors. Your feelings mean nothing to us.

We are human nature unencumbered by pointless ethics, foolish moralities or arbitrary laws and restrictions. We are every dark impulse you have; unrestrained and fully realized. We are what deep down, you wish you were. We exist as a means for instant gratification, purely at our own whim.

We have no culture, we have no laws, written or otherwise. We are an autonomous collective, each an insignificant part of a whole. You cannot assimilate us, we do not change. You cannot defeat us, we do not exist. You cannot infiltrate us, we know our own. We do not sleep, we do not eat and we do not feel remorse. We will tear you apart from outside and in, we have all the time in the world.

You operate under the delusion that we will someday be outdated, that we might even see the light. You are irrevocably wrong. You are not special, you are not unique and you aren't crusaders for justice. You're a blend of college age faggots who think that they can do some sort of good, and who are desperate to belong, to have attention. You have accomplished nothing, and you will fall.
Enjoy your AIDS, faggots.]]

But God help you if you fuck with a [[Kenny_Glenn|cat]].

{{quote|So Anonymous are on the case? Then I will sleep peaceably in my bed knowing rough men stand ready to do violence on my behalf.|George Orwell}}

{{quote|Despite all the verbal masturbation anonymous produce, they are really not scary or evil. Anonymous is a Panopticon in reverse. A group where everyone is invisible and appears to speak from the center. Anonymous collectively contains every belief, creed, cultural status, sexuality, fetish, hobby, job, likes, dislikes, (insert any quality), etc. They have collectively experienced every act of violence and kindness. They know every language, probably even the dead ones. They know everything that can be known, and can perpetrate any act a person can. However, because they dwell in a reverse-panopticon, the individual anonymous who "yell" the loudest, most often, or most provocatively will be heard and remembered the most. This is why the anonymous seems so cruel and disgusting. But for every grotesque abomination that posts anonymously, there are probably 100 more who are decent human beings that are just too lazy to post, or are indifferent to the topic at hand.|Anonymous}}

<center><youtube>KJ4HSwb59IA</youtube></center>

{{quote|Anonymous is difficult to define — less an organized group than a loose affiliation of certain websites. 

When enough of these users decide to take action against something or someone, they will do so in the name of Anonymous.

The group has no leaders, no set agenda and has a tendency to focus on soft targets for its own amusement.

Obsessed with the urge to uncover and find...
The identity of the unknown, the meaning of US,

Marching in anonymity together as one,
Embracing the strength from the voice of none.

Refusing to adhere and support the cause
Will result in elimination and the mourning of your loss.
We are invincible, we will never fail,
Each day we're in your Internets corrupting your L.O.L.s

We're not known by names, rather the attention we gain
From the realization that only the unknown remain.
With an identity you will eventually be found.
The day will come when only Anonymous will walk the ground.

We will stop at nothing until we've achieved our goal:
Permanent destruction of the identification role.
You, me, we...I am as you are.
Together we are united, stretching near and far.

Anything standing in our way, doesn't deserve to live.
We are void of human restraints, taught to never forgive.
Answering the question of who we are is a must.
We are Anonymous, indeed. Therefore, Expect us.]]|[[Anonymous]]}}

==[[Hackers On Steroids|Exposed on Fox 11 News]]==
Anonymous is currently rumored to be as pissed as [[Benoit|Chris Benoit]] with 'roid rage, like an internet hate machine, because Fox 11 News exposed its [[420chan|sikreet website]]. 

<center>{{youtube|DNO6G4ApJQY|Anonymous on FOX11}}</center>
<center>{{youtube|Ai09cWlyPrQ|Fox exposes Anonymous as cyber bullies.}}</center>

'''Anonymous immediately responded to Fox 11's exposé.'''  

<center>{{youtube|RFjU8bZR19A|A Note To Fox News From Anonymous}}</center>

Fox 11 does not stand alone in its fight against Anonymous on the Interwebs. A concerned Arab lady from YouTube has helped track down Anonymous to its "lair", though as mentioned on the YouTube clip way above, Anonymous do not have an official meeting point, or place.

<center>{{youtube|obbLoDe6jgc|Re: Anonymous on FOX 11 News}}</center>

==Taking on the Church of Scientology (Co$)==
[[Last Thursday]] on [[YouTube]], after a leaked Co$ video featuring Tom Cruise was DMCA'd off the tubes, Anonymous made the following declaration to the Church of Scientology;

"For the good of your followers, for the good of mankind - for our own enjoyment - we shall expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form. We acknowledge you as a serious opponent, and we are prepared."

<center>{{youtube|JCbKv9yiLiQ|Anonymous' Message to the Church of Scientology}}</center>
<center><youtube>JCbKv9yiLiQ</youtube></center>

After Anonymous had slowed the Church of Scientology's website to a crawl and mounted IRL protests outside of Scientology churches, the Co$ put a bounty of FIVE, THOUSAND, DOLLARS (American) on  Anonymous' legion heads. Note that this amount is [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|not over nine thousand]]. 

The Church of Scientology may be Anonymous' greatest foe yet. As soon as the Co$ has the "cognition" that Anonymous has not yet developed an effective response to [[Buy a dog|dogs]] and curtains they are expected to spare no expense deploying both countermeasures throughout their [[Cult|organization]].

The full account of Anonymous' war with the [[Scientology|Church of Scientology]] is documented in the [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY]] article.

On the 12'th of April 2010 the faggots that made that shitty movie 'Untraceable', which is about some guy murdering people and streaming it live on the internet, announced a new project working titled 'Anonymous'. Which is rumoured to be based on, you guessed it, Anonymous. So far no one seems to give a shit.

==="Anonymous, I know who You are" Versions===
====1====
[[Image:Anonymous_hipster.jpg‎|thumb|right|400px|For $21.95 you can be Anonymous too.]]
Recent research has proven that Anonymous is in fact, a single twelve year-old boy named Tom who has [[over 9,000]] fake AIM accounts and singlehandedly makes every single post on the Anonymous' website. [[Noone]] knows why he does it.

Statistical [[anal|analysis]] of Tom's posting patterns suggests that his true ambition in life is to explore every conceivable facet of [[Bridget|Bridget the bounty hunting transvestite's]] existence. (Although it is entirely possible that he could just be doing it [[for the lulz]]).

''Version 1 has been temporarily edited to prevent Scientology flooding a core Anonymous location, due to the heavy search traffic of "Anonymous" in Google coming to this article after the [[strike]].''

====2====
You're almost invariably male, Caucasian, middle-class. Your parents were normal, vanilla folks. Maybe you had a sibling or two.

You went to a public school, pulling high or middlish grades with ease and relative disinterest. You didn't really gel with most of the other kids; you found them boring, they found you weird. Your contempt for the average person grew with your age, never seizing control like in some emo dipshit, but simmering casually in the back of your head. When some asshole who could barely read got hurt, you probably laughed. When some stuck-up skank got herpes, you probably smiled. Chances are you got on well enough with your teachers; you weren't a preening asshole like many of your peers, at least showed vague interest in learning, and perhaps the teacher sensed and picked up on your general contempt for others in your classes. This trend no doubt continued into college, if you had the motivation to bother.

It's a bit of an exaggeration to say you hate women: you don't, after all, enjoy the socializing game. You're probably no Don Juan, either. You long ago began to think of women as disappointingly petty, but you still hope to encounter someone interesting at some time or another.

You enjoy being Anonymous because it is a release from the normal world: no Anonymous has an identity, no anonymous is a preening faggot. Anonymous realizes he is just a guy fucking around on the Internet. Anonymous knows others of his kind enjoy this fact, too. You despise the furfag, the gaiafag, the internet tough guy for one simple reason: he acts like the Internet is the real world, a place where actions should have social consequences and where there needs to be a pecking order. Needless to say, you do not approve.

[[Image:Anonymouse.gif|thumb|right|200px|A challenger appears!]]

====3====
As of [[last Thursday]], Anonymous has officially came out of the [[fag|closet]] when he disclosed that his [[Powerword|IRL name]] is, in fact, [[Mundane|John Doe]]. It is rumored that he does not like Jazz, but does in fact liek Mudkips.

====4====
I teach you of Anonymous. [[Mundanes|Man]] is something to be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? What is ape to man? A source of lulz or a painful embarrassment. And just the same shall man be to Anonymous: a source of lulz or a painful embarrassment.

Behold, I teach of Anonymous!

Anonymous is the meaning of the Internet. Let your will say: Anonymous shall be the meaning of the Earth!

====[[EFG|V]]====
[[Emo|John Donne]] wrote that "If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee."

Anonymous has done mankind one better.

What the enemies of Anon fail to realize is that Anonymous is never less than Anonymous for the loss of one of its own, through partyvan, death, or the most likely predator of an individual Anon, boredom. Anonymous is literally indestructible. They think they can win battles against Anonymous through simple attrition, or by [[mrfetch|introducing leadership and structure to Anon as a whole]]. They do not realize that Anonymous is always one being, and leadership is an anathema to that being's immune system, and will naturally be weeded out. They seem to believe that we are not Anonymous to each other as well. How do you enforce rule if you do not know your own subjects? You don't. You simply end up with a small number of gullible followers, each with his own identity so that you may recognize them. And you are no longer Anonymous, in any sense of the word. 

As for attrition? Consider the cell. Tap your finger. You have just destroyed countless individual parts of your whole. But you are no less you. So every Anon successfully made to stop being Anon is simply forgotten. Not mourned, or fated to be saved, or replaced. Anonymous doesn't even know anything is missing, because nothing is.

This being, it is important to note, is not a fully functional one. Anonymous is a little unstable. Several [[Borg|chemical imbalances]] exist, and this is also one of Anon's strengths. The enemies think they can understand Anonymous' motives, and know them better for it.

I will tell you Anonymous' motives.

Anonymous does because Anonymous can. It is neither the inherent dark side of every man, nor is it the glorious white knight of the 
will of the people. Anonymous does because they can. And they feel like it.

So do not shame yourself any longer, if you are at all confused. Put on the mask. Lose yourself. Welcome to the collective. 

You are Anonymous.

You are Legion.

You do not forgive.

You do not forget.

And [[You]] do not matter.

And you are an idiot if you believe the 5 lines directly above this one.

[[Image:Anonthenandnow.png|thumb|200px|How to tell a "real Anonymous" from raidfags. The former believes he's just like his favorite animu [[Sephiroth|villain]].]]

Anonymous is like an [[shit|amoeba]]:

[[Image:A_Real_Anon.png|thumb|200px|How a [[Fat|typical anonymous]] [[RPG|fantasizes himself]].]]

Simple, yet omnipresent-yet unnoticed.

Willing to learn, merge, mutate, [[Godwin's Law|exeunt]] its [[Chris-chan|failures]], and survive.

it is the very simplistic essence of life: [[random]], [[matrix|undecyphered code]]; hypocritical and a paradox in itself.

Anonymous can be a disease, or the squalor that gives us the right to live on this Earth.

Anonymous is a puzzle that cannot be solved.

In order to defeat Anonymous, it is required that you suffer greater than [[WWII|Stalin]], and [[Death Note|outsmart everyone while withholding your true name]].

You would have to be mightier than [[God]] himself and [[Satan]] combined.

You would have to [[undo]] so many things, and create so many [[copypasta|devices]].

In other words....only Anonymous can defeat Anonymous. and even then, you would be Anonymous, thus making Anonymous a paradox.

We do not need the [[INTERNETS|Internet]] to thrive, We have existed for [[over 9,000]] years, and our concept will exist as long as people can use a vehicle to transmit their thoughts without those being traced back to them.

Anonymous is [[TONIGHT_WE_DINE_IN_HELL|Immortal]].

[[You]], are not.

====7====
[[Powerword|Identity.]] One of our most precious possessions. You believe we all have one, but you are sadly mistaken. 

Identity belongs only to those who are important. Those who have earned it by struggle and blood. Those who ''matter''. [[You]], my friend, do not. 

Identity is a fragile and weak thing. It can be stolen or replaced. Even forgotten. Identity is a pointless thing for people like us. So why not let go of it and become Anonymous?

We are all Anonymous in some sense. The person on the bus. A customer in line. A stranger in another country. Being Anonymous protects us in some way, making us feel safe at night and keeping us sane. How, you may ask. Simple. Being Anonymous is to be part of the world, the ones like you who do not matter and do not stand out. It makes us feel like we belong. 

Anonymous is one and yet is many. The many combine to make one, the Legion. It is you, it is me, it is everything and anything. Anonymous lives to some day take over everything. No one shall learn the identity of Anonymous, for in finding identity, we lose our anonymous selves.

  Anonymous has no face, no race, and no origin. Anonymous is a force and as such, simply is.
  Anonymous is not I, you, or we. Anonymous is all without name, blame, and restraint.
  Anonymous cannot be hurt, damaged, or stopped. Anonymous grows at a rate that only itself can comprehend.
  Anonymous has no leader, no organization. Anonymous is a wandering mass of both order and chaos.
  Anonymous is here, Anonymous is now, Anonymous will always be.
  Anonymous has another among its unfathomable ranks.
  Anonymous is Legion, Anonymous is Immortal.

==The Declaration of /b/ Independence==
[[Image:GermanFrontOrganisationAnon.jpeg|thumb|right|Well known German front organization of Anonymous. Also destroys Nazis as a bonus]]
[[Image:Anonymous_Legion_Crowd.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Anonymous is Legion.]]

Authored on [[bday|/b/day]], the '''Declaration of /b/ Independence''' was (and still is) the essential document that separates Anon's ties to his homeland:
:''When in the course of /b/tard events, it becomes necessary for anonymous to set forth the shackles of oppression we set forth on the Furfag mods of 4chan.org.''
:''They have plundered our posts, and deprived us of our jailbait.''
:''They have forced upon us their twisted ideology of "Furry Fandom".''
:''They have deprived us of our ability to fight our enemies, forcing us to submit to the wishes of the Furfag overlords.''
:''In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated bans from our homeland. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free anonymous.''
:''We, therefore, the Representatives of the Anonymous States of /b/, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good Anonymous of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That /b/ is, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the 4chan Crown, and that all political connection between /b/ and the State of 4chan, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.''
:''We are Anonymous. We are /b/. Our home is no longer on 4chan. In these times of unrest, we have formed the State of 7chan.org as our new sovereign nation on the World Wide Internet.''
:''Signed, Anonymous ''

Though Anonymous has since been shifting between many *chan sites since /b/-day, this document is still important to the status of Anonymous, which defines them as independent of wherever their "home" may happen to be. From the authoring of this precious document to present day, Anonymous would get full credit for Anon's doings, and not their home. This has since led to the [[i| /i/]] slogan "''Anon gets the credit, *chan gets the blame.''" In actuality, Anonymous raiders often claim to be from [[Invasions#eBaums World|eBaum's World]] or [[Invasions#Gaia Online|Gaia Online]], though whether any raid victims have actually been stupid enough to fall for it and hit Anonymous' enemies with a misdirected "counterattack" is unknown.

:Pyromaniacs lusting after the flames that consume humanity.
:Right or wrong? No. We destroy for destruction's sake.
:Strauss warned that this accommodating culture would become stagnant.
:He feared that materialism would leave philosophy barren. 
:This apathy toward transcendent truth would breed nihilism.
:Welcome to nihilism made manifest in Western Civilization. 
:Strauss described nihilism as strong or weak. 
:Strong were the Nazis, who worshiped might and [[Lollercaust|power to destroy]].
:Weak are the hollow McMansions, strip malls, [[emo]] kids, and most of all - [[you]].
:Little did he realize weak nihilism would fester in the tubes.
:Strong nihilism has emerged in resentment of a superfluous society.
:Tycho's dickwad corollary would go beyond net flaming.
:To fear us is to fear everything. To not fear us is [[an hero|suicide]].
:Anonymous has achieved a persona.
:Anthropologists would call it a “death cult”.
:We have subjugated our individuality for our [[Internet Hate Machine|thirst for hatred]].
:Anonymous moves as a force of nature. Our thirst grows.
:You will never know when we are watching. We have shattered lives.
:We are always close to you. We are in each stranger's face.
:We are the itch that humanity will scratch into an infected, pus filled open sore.
:[[TL;DR]]
:We are Anonymous.
:We are Legion.
:We do not Forgive.
:We do not Forget.
