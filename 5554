In [[Last Thursday|mid-August]] of [[2008]], [[Something Awful]] forum goon and creator of ''[[Electric Retard]]'', Sigvatr, [http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2934761 released] a personal project he'd nearly abandoned, a simple video game known as '''''Muslim Massacre'''''. The concept was simple enough: shoot every [[Muslim]] until [[Noone|none]] survived.

==[[The Game]]==
[[Image:MmassacreDOITNOW.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bad|Are you a bad enough dude?]]]]
With a top-down view, a machine gun, and stacks of grenades, ''Muslim Massacre'' somewhat resembles classic [[arcade]] (and later [[Console Wars|console]]) games such as '''''Commando''''', '''''Berzerk''''' or '''''Smash TV''''', only with more Muslims and more [[blood]]. The player fights minute-long rounds advancing through a growing pile of Islamic [[guro|corpses]] on [[No girls on the internet|his]] quest to ultimately [[pwn|kill]] [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Islam#Muhammad|Muhammad]], and finally [[God|Allah]] himself.

Were the game [[Capitalism|commercially available]], the packaging would likely read something like this:
<blockquote>''[[USA|The United States of America]], a leader and role model for all in the modern world, is taking [[Final solution|drastic measures]] to secure the [[freedom]] and safety of the world. Having borne witness to the [[:Image:Lmho.gif|atrocities]] of the [[Terrorists|followers of Islam]] [[Over 9000|time and time again]], it has been decided that the entire Muslim race shall be [[Genocide|wiped from the surface of the Earth]].''

''[[You]], the American [[An Hero|Hero]], have valiantly volunteered to make landfall in the [[Middle East]] and ensure that no Muslim [[man]] or [[woman]] is left alive. Your mission priorities are to seek out and neutralize the Muslim leader Osama bin Laden, their radical [[cult]] leader Muhammad and finally Allah, [[VTEC Just Kicked In Yo|taking down any targets you meet on the way]].''</blockquote>

==The [[shit]] hits the fan==

Like most offensive Goon projects ''Muslim Massacre'' enjoyed a fairly longish [[thread]] with most readers enjoying the game, complimenting it, and suggesting minor improvements. The GBS morality [[Fags|brigade]] soon chimed in like the [[Crybaby|threadshitters]] they are, pointing out that it was incredibly [[racist]] and therefore quite lulzy, which was of course [[Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhh|the point]]. Collectively, GBS was happy with Sigvatr's product and the thread enjoyed near-gold popularity before fading into obscurity and falling off the front page.

The day before [[9/11|September 11]], however, The thread was [[Thread necromancy|resuscitated]] and a second [http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2954789 thread] was posted. Apparently the [[old media]] had discovered this 8-bit religious bloodbath and went absolutely [[batshit]] over what would otherwise have been [[404|forgotten]]. With the media attention, as could be expected, came [[rage|outraged]] [[Muslims]] and the angrier [[white people]] eager to defend a cause, any cause.

{{tinyquote|Encouraging children and young people in a game to kill Muslims is unacceptable, [[Alt.tasteless|tasteless]] and deeply offensive... 

There is an increase in [[violence]] in this country and some of it comes from [[video games]]. When kids spend six hours a day on violent games they are more likely to go outside and [[murder|commit violence]]. 

If it was the other way around, with a game featuring Muslims killing [[Israel]]is or Americans, there would be uproar and rightly so. 

We would urge [[ISP]]s to [[ban|take action]] against sites like this.|Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of The Ramadhan Foundation, after [[fail]]ing to complete the first round}}

Nevermind the fact that [[Britain]]'s violence seems to stem from the growth of the [[chav]] population and the fact that their [[police]] don't carry [[guns]], making them ineffective at protecting the public, [[Blaming China|video games are to blame]]! A [[blog]] on ''[[The Guardian]]'' went so far as to ask the all-important question: [http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2008/sep/11/technologygames should the internet game '''''Muslim Massacre''''' be banned?] Of course this important commentary forgets entirely that once something is available on the internet it is [[Archive.org|available forever]] no matter what.

Sigvatr's websites ''[[Electric Retard]]'' and the homepage for ''Muslim Massacre'' were quickly [[suspended]] by his webhost without warning. Likely fearing the [[rape|repercussions]] presented by thousands of bomb-toting terrorists, his ISP folded like a house wife when daddy gets home smelling like whiskey. Meanwhile Australian police have begun to investigate the game in a misguided attempt to minimize Muslim [[butthurt]] and to harass a freedom-loving, red-blooded [[American]]. In his own [[defense]], Sigvatr has stated that the game is a blatant [[satire]] and not meant to be taken [[The Internet is serious business|seriously]] or as legitimate social commentary.

{{quote|If I was to try and come up with a meaning for the game at this moment, it would probably be something along the lines of metaphorically destroying the stereotypical depiction of a Muslim.|Sigvatr, talking out of his ass}}

==[[lie|We didn't see this coming. Not at all.]]==
Early in the morning on September 15th Sig [[bump]]ed the second thread, entitled ''Goon-made racist videogame makes international news'', stating that he'd posted the apology on his personal site [[bullshit|in order to appease his webhost and have his various domains restored]]. Apparently it worked and the '''''Muslim Massacre''''' homepage is back online once again offending Muslims across the world. At this point in time, however, the [[cynical]] goons have painted him as the [[attention whore]] that he is with Helldump posters crawling from beneath their [[basement|rocks]] to render the thread a wasteland. Soon afterward [[moderator]]s found their way into the mess to pick up the pieces and [[ban|clean up after]] Sigvatr and his detractors.
