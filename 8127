'''TheWetRabbit''' is a 38-year-old pedophile [[babyfur]] who resides on [[deviantART]] and [[FurAffinity]], and will [[rape]] your eyes with [[Photoshop]] filters in his pictures, fuck your ears with [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/890496/ amazing music], then persecute [[ED]]iots and [[Troll]]s by doing [[Cry|what he does best.]]

==His Epic Quest Against ED==

[[Image:TWRFAj258098EDSux.gif|thumb|right|Please - for fucks sake - [[STFU]].]]

TheWetRabbit first came to attention with his anti-ED journals. He happens to be a friend of [[Knuffy]], who told him about all the butthurt he got!

{{Quote|[[O RLY|Oh really?]] Wisdom from an total [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/176158/ tard]... now how novel a thing is that, I ask you? Heh. But really...It's a shame such punks aren't shut down and [[lolsuit|taken too court]]. Because, as I understand it, even cyber harassment IS a crime punishable by [[lawl|law]].|TWR}}

{{Quote|ED is a site custom made for the [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/258098/ drama making], scene whore, gutless wonder poser types that run the show over there.
How would THEY like it if people got a hold of all the personal info of the top people over there and plastered it all over the web for people to see?|Captain Butthurt}}

{{quote|Fiction - ED thinks that I "think" their talentless tards "conspiring against him" (meaning me).

Fact - I don't "think" ED is talentless [http://thewetrabbit.deviantart.com/journal/15939110/ tards], I [[fact|KNOW]] they are. As for conspiring against me, this would somehow indicate that I somehow am afraid of them. Nothing could be further from the truth.|TWR. [[BAWWW]]}}

{{quote|See, while [http://thewetrabbit.deviantart.com/journal/15887791/ this] will surely come as a shock to ED, and also maybe those with no taste as well, "humor" in the truest sense of the phrase, does not involve something as totally devoid of humor or good taste as trolling.|You tell 'em, girlfriend.}}

{{quote|ED says: You tell 'em, girlfriend

WR Punches [[retard|special]] ED [[Applemilk1988|full force]] dead in their fugly face, they fall to the ground and WR says:

[[You]] tell 'em toothless bloody face. You tell 'em hospital emergency room candidate. You tell 'em gutless wonder. You tell 'em bear [[trap]] [[Fucking|using]], dead squirrel abusing, wastes of space/oxygen and internet bandwidth.

You live only to pull stupid [http://thewetrabbit.deviantart.com/journal/16028015/ lulzy] tricks and mind games on others... then when you find that it doesn't work out for you, you're left looking even stupider than you normally look, (And that is DEFINITELY saying something considering how [[NO U|stupid your normally look to begin with]]).|[[internet tough guy|ITG]]}}

{{quote|Despite what [[winrar|those of you choosing to love ED]] seem to think...it is NOT an opinion it is a FACT...[[at least 100|ONE HUNDRED]]..PERCENT..[[fact|FACT]]...that ED has intentionally singled out [[Knuffy|countless member]] of the [http://thewetrabbit.deviantart.com/journal/16084402/ furry] fandom who did NOTHING and yes I MEAN NOTHING...to them first. If you can't or don't want to believe that, then please STOP reading this RIGHT NOW.|[[ALL CAPS]]}}

To say something like that, it must be because he's really talented, right? Right?

==No More Wet Rabbit?==
It seems that the other day, our dear furry friend has [[delete fucking everything|blanked]] his DA account and blanked all the comments. But all is not lost. By the way, the last journal entry in this gallery shows a list of people he wanted banned. The list totals to no more and no less than [[OVER 9000|eighty-six users]]. Three of those users are administrators (namely, chix0r, lolly, and moonbeam13)! Madmantyke (FiztheAncient) also makes a cameo appearance on the list.

[[PROTIP]]: Real men settle disputes with words, not fists and knives. TWR wouldn't know this as his [[balls]] never dropped, though.

His FurAffinity gallery is still active.

==Beyond DA==
Recently, TWR has begun spreading faggotry across [[YouTube]] while continuing his [[Fail|War On Lulz]]. In addition to involving himself with zoophile [[Wolfeedarkfang]], TWR has issued a set of guidelines on how to be a [[Fucktard|True Furry]], as well as helpful tips on [[Friends only|keeping profiles safe]] from trolling. 

After a brief period of relative silence, WetRabbit decided he would launch his plan of attack against the trolls that [[E-go|took YouTube from him]]. However, [[X is not your personal army|he didn't find the support]] amongst the [[Furfag|Furry]] population that he had so desperately desired, and thus soundly concluded that [[Success|the trolls have obtained victory]] over them, the reality being that furries are rightfully disgusted with his behavior. As on DA, over time other furries requested that WetRabbit [[Stfu|refrain from his crusade]], to which he [[Crybaby|respectfully disagreed.]] [[Stupid|Well thought out and strongly worded]] messages were sent to everyone with an opposing viewpoint.

Before long, he had accused at least several furries on YouTube of supporting several trolls he so despises. In this incident, he got in a dispute with former friend and once-hardcore supporter EnslavedByDragons, after TWR discovered that he was friends with a [[Winner|troll whom he despised]]. While trying to discuss the conflicting opinions civilly, TWR went off on a 10 message, [[tl;dr|10-30 paragraph]] long rant for literally [[No life|four straight hours]].

He then, in a last fit of rage upon realizing he had alienated what little support he had gained up to that point, had his YouTube account [[Pool's Closed|closed due to failure]].

== Back on DA ==
While TWR is no longer on DA with his account baleeted over there, [[furry|furries]] begin to ignore TWR's [[fail|advice]] on dealing with trolls. After TWR [[fail|attacked]] ChuongChoSoi, he posted a [http://chuongchosoi.deviantart.com/journal/18651537/#comments journal] on DA revealing TWR's [[faggotry]]. Chuong also claimed that TWR was using a [[fail|translator]] to see what he and Vietfox said about him in Vietnamese. Chuong and Vietfox also claimed that TWR is so [[fucktard|paranoid]], that [[pedophile|he watches every single furry and troll]] to make sure they don't join forces against him. TWR always believed that [[bullshit|furries should not support trolls]] and that trolls should be removed off the Internet as well as furries who support trolling.

Even though TWR is [[dead|dead]] [[OTI|OTI]], the hunt for whats left from his [[faggotry|faggotry]] continues.
