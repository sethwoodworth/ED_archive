Reverend X
[[Image:Angryrevx.gif|frame|right|HE IS SUPREME]]<b>Reverend X</b> is Light made flesh; he is the incarnation of the Demiurge. Don Vincent, as he was originally born, soon realized that he was not the mouth of [[God]], but in fact, God himself. He was born at least [[100 years ago]], and is the most influential entity since that [[nigra]] [[Jesus]]. He has many of his powerful, moving sermons online (see below). Now recognized by the [[catholic|Vatican]] for his authenticity, he has been compared to [[Barack Obama|that Islam guy]].

== His Word ==
[[Image:Blackpreacherbeeotch212ji.gif|frame|well, are you laughin' beyotch?]]
Reverend X is the prophet of the current age, as verified by many scholars, particularly [[your mom]]. The man is no mere mortal. He can do various things, including:
* Cut that bitch off
* Smack yo' ass wit his pimp cane
* Be omnipotent
* Get some lawyers, train 'em up in the word, them scripturahs
* Know his bidness
* Have the appearance of a black man

At times, the preacher starts to dance and frolic around; do '''NOT''' be fooled. This is God attempting to fool you. Also, when he has trouble reading, that's also to fool you. As is anything he does wrong. It's a test, bitch, and part of his [[Nazi|master plan]].

== His Mission ==
Reverend X is the savior of our race and humanity. As done [[9000]] years ago by [[Raptor Jesus]], Don Vincent walks the earth waiting to be crucified. It seems that the Spirit of Truth does have some idea of what he's doing. In his various speakings, he has stated his plans for the future. He says he need lawyers and people willing to not be "under whitey's rule" to rise up against the system on the Earf' not consulting the Bible or his scriptures when making a decisions. He says "it's about getting them lawyers, trainin' 'em up in the word these scriptures." He's knows that he must gets the widows and the homeless "up out them penitentiaries."

== His Legacy ==
Despite being [[Tourette's Guy|The Lord Almighty, Ruler Of Heaven And Earf And Every Goddamn Thing In Between]], the Jew permabanned Reverend X from old media, cause [[bitches don't know]] bout his Survival Scrolls.
