Militant
A strong believer in some [[:Category: Subcultures|sub-culture]].  To the militant it's not enough to just associate with the like-minded.  They have a compelling need to convert unbelievers, insult everyone else, and generally be annoying.  Militants give a bad name to the normal (meaning non-sociopathic) people who share their beliefs.

The [[childfree]], [[linux|Linux users]], [[atheists]], [[feminists]], [[christian]]s, and [[whatever]] all get their bad reputation from their militant members. Note we did not include [[Macintosh]] users, as all [[100]][[%]] of Mactards are flaming, militant faggots.
