'''Def Leppard''' are an [[England|English]] [[gay|rock]] band from [[Wales|Sheffield]], who formed in 1977 as part of the [[britfag|New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] movement. Largely on the strength of their albums ''[[Lily Allen|Pyromania]]'' and ''[[CP|Hysteria]]'', Def Leppard became one of the [[money|top-selling]] rock bands throughout the 1980s, selling [[over 9000]] albums worldwide
''See main article at [[Vista]].''

'''Snow Leopard''' aka '''OSX 10.6.0''' aka '''[[Vista|Apple Vista]]''' is [[Steve Jobs]]' ([[Kanye West|who doesn't care about Mac people]]) revolutionary, new intuitive [[troll|operating system]] for [[Mac]] computers which only took the intuitive [[hippies|Geniuses]] at Apple about 10 years to go from rumour to full (intuitive) release in October 2009. 

Upon arrival, the legions of rabid fanbois were thrilled to find out that it wasn't so much a new intuitive OS as a flashy, minimalist minor (intuitive) upgrade of '''Leopard'''. However, most Macfags were thrilled with all the new intuitive [[crap|bells and whistles]] and hunkered down in their mothers' basements to fap over all the new intuitive 'improvements' (like ... ). 

==The "Improvements"==
[[Image:ILife_-_something_happened.png|thumb|[[LOL WUT|You'll have to use your intuition to figure out what]]. Snow Leopard: computing made simple]]
*Snow Leopard magically (and intuitively) turns all your Bluetooth devices like wireless keyboards and mice into useless intuitive paperweights. It does this by intuitively ignoring the built-in Bluetooth modules and intuitively pretending you don't have Bluetooth installed. It also negates any hopes you had of syncronicity with your [[iPhone]].

*Snow Leopard will intuitively deactivate all your USB peripherals like digital cameras and intuitively restore their factory setting to whatever year you bought it. Alternately, Snow Leopard will intuitively fail to recognise anything you plug in.

*Snow Leopard will intuitively reset all of your system preferences every time a minor patch comes down the tubes. Anything you customised or changed on your machine after installing the intuitive original, 10.6.0, will revert to the factory settings. As a bonus, 10.6.2 will intuitively randomly change your settings and preferences to the defaults on any of the (now deactivated) peripherals .

*Snow Leopard's radical '''[[usb cord|Time Machine]]''' intuitively backs-up all your [[porn|stuff]], (factory) settings and applications automatically so that you [[lazy|don't have to worry about it]]. However, since Snow Leopard will either intuitively ignore or reconfigure the external disc you've chosen for backup, you'll have to use ''your'' intuition and back your shit up elsewhere too.

*Snow Leopard's '''Rosetta''' intuitively 'translates' all your [[old meme|PowerPC]] and pre-OSX 10.6 applications for seamless integration with the Intel/10.6 environment. As an optional installation that comes with your Snow Leopard software, it eliminates migration hassles since you can't actually install it.

*Snow Leopard comes with the brand-spanking-new [[vidya|QuickTime 10]] -whether you want it or not. And since QuickTime 10 doesn't come with a browser plugin, you'll have to use your imagination when trying to view instructional vidyas on Apple's website.

*The snow leopard ([[pedo|Uncia]] uncia or [[cougar|Panther]]a uncia), sometimes known as [[drug|ounce]], is a moderately large [[cat]] native to the mountain ranges of Central [[Asia]]. The classification of this species has been subject to [[arbchat|change]] and its exact taxonomic position will not be resolved until [[beta|further studies]] are conducted.
