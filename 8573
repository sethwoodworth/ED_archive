'''Tsukinohoshi''' (now at [http://deviant-zangel.deviantart.com/ ~Deviant-ZAngel] ) is an [[epic]] [[lolcow]] TARTlet who has shit-tastic pictures uploaded on her [[devianTART]] page.  Her real name is Katrina Welch, but she insists on using the [[kawaii]] [[desu]] penname, Kat Kitty.  Her entire page is plastered with wanna-be [[Sailor Moon]] characters and super [[kawaii]] [[desu]] images too horrible to be called art.  She is also a huge [[weaboo]] and one of the biggest [[Mary Sue]]s ever spawned.

Kat has her own magical girl story, and tries to pass it off as the most original thing ever even though it's painfully obvious that she saw one too many [[Sailor Moon]] episodes and decided that it would be super special awesome if she was to make her own story that was practically a carbon copy.  If you try to confront her about this, though, she'll just deny it over and over and if you make her angry enough she'll post a journal about you and her inbox will be flooded with the pseudo-concern of millions of TARTlets who are either too stupid to realize how horrible her art is or just like to watch her page [[for the lulz]].  Don't be fooled: she is not a [[troll]], as much as she looks like one.  She is just incredibly [[Wapanese]].

== The Summary of Her Fagtastic Story ==
For your [[Pain Series|viewing pleasure]], here is the summary of Zodiac Angels directly from the [[Anus|mouth]] of the lovely artist Tsukinohoshi. KAWAII DESU NE!!
{{cs2|zodiacangelssumm1|Zodiac Angels: A Summation (No shit, this is what it's really about.)|
This story is a magical girl story about twelve young earth girls who are given the powers of the Zodiac and transform into magical angels. It is a story that explains how we can become easily corrupted. It is a story about war, religion, morals, betrayels, love, friendship and courage. 
<br /><br />
Queen Alexanderia is the queen of the angel kingdom. Because their were so many different powers of the zodiac, Queen Alexanderia created the zodiac gems that contained all of the zodiac powers. She originally created the Zodiac Gems to guide all living creatures to their destiny, and to help them throughout their daily lives. 
<br /><br />
These powers would be easier for the queen to monitor if they are in the form of gems, so that is why she made the zodiac gemstones. The magical powers from the zodiac were what also gave all living creatures the life source that they had.
<br /><br />
As the gemstones continued to gain more and more power, the queen realized that someone would eventually try and take the gems for themselves, and misuse them for whatever purpose that they would need them for. 
<br /><br />
Queen Alexanderia sent them down to earth where they will be safe, hiding them inside living and non-living things to make them a lot harder to find. All animated and in-animated objects carry the Zodiac Gems. Within a person or an animal, the zodiac gems can be found deep inside the person's or creature's soul. The gems themselves come in many different colors, and, each gem have the symbols of the zodiac signs written on its center.
<br /><br />
King Drake is the king of the vampire kingdom, and when he discovered the zodiac gemstones, he decided to take them for his own selfish reasons. He thinks that these pendants will give him the power he needs to take over the universe. King Drake desires more power because he's very greedy; he's not satisfied until he has more power. With the newly found information on the Zodiac Gemstones, he decided to send out his loyal vampire warriors and their monsters to earth. He also thinks that the zodiac gemstones would be a nice addition for his collection of luxurious items. 
<br /><br />
In order to find and activate the gemstones, a spirit from any living creature is required. 
If the spirit activates the magic in one of the zodiac gemstones, it will create powerful magic. 
<br /><br />
Whoever has the gemstones will be able to purify or impurify the universe. 
<br /><br />
If the evil King Drake gets the zodiac gems first, the world will be plagued with impurities, destruction and evil. The world and everyone in it will also be converted to evil. The universe will become corrupted with evil as well. The world and the universe it lives in will be a place of darkness, violence, bloodshed and hatred. 
<br /><br />
To prevent this from happening, Queen Alexanderia chooses twelve young earth girls to become the Zodiac Angels and protect the magical powers of the zodiac and to also protect the universe. 
<br /><br />
Will these new angels of justice be able to stop him, or will the universe be doomed to evil and destruction? Can the Zodiac Angels save the universe, and defeat the vampires before it's too late? To find out, please read the story. |0}}

=== A Better, More Accurate Summary ===
[[image:Angel Brain Cancer.JPG|thumb|This is what you see before you die.]]

The author, Tsukinohoshi (or Kat) is an unoriginal [[shit]] who couldn't think of any better story if her life depended on it.  Her [[Mary Sue|self-insert character]], [[Sailor Moon|Ashley Angelic]], transforms into a magical girl named Angel [[Cancer]], probably so named because looking at Kat's art will give you a fucking brain tumor. There are eleven other Angels and they all have names that are just as fucking [[retarded]] (Star Stellar or Candy Candison, anyone?) as well as cookie cutter personalities and powers directly ripped from Sailor Moon. They receive SPESHUL POWAHZ from Queen [[Spellcheck|Alexanderia]], queen of the angel kingdom, who wants them to protect the universe because with her boundless power and undoubtedly huge angel army, she obviously can't fucking do it herelf. All the girls are 14 ([[Pedophile|except for one who is 10]]), thus [[lolis]]. Despite Kat being a [[nigra]], [[Denial|all her characters are white]] except for two who are black and one who's a Mexican (and she puts [[Racist|HEAVY emphasis]] on the fact that she's [[Mexico|Mexican]]). There's one dude character whose name is [[Gay|Zoey]] and is screwing Angel Cancer. All the Angels are fighting against [[Edward Cullen|King Drake, king of the vampires]], who like every villain in every other anime is trying to take over the UNIVARSE LOL.

=== Similarities Between Zodiac Angels and [[Sailor Moon]] ===
* Main character has pigtails
* Also a pretty magic [[Dildo|staff]]
* Main character's attacks involve copious amounts of [[Rainbow|rainbows]]
* A [[furry]] creature gives her and her friends the magic powers
* They transform into other personas, yet do not change at all in appearance (Other than their SUPER KAWAII DESU NE senshi outfits, of course!)
* It's painfully obvious who the main girl is supposed to be in love with
* They have super pretty magical girl transformation sequences
* There is an evil villain that is plotting to take over the universe
* Queen Alexanderia = Queen Serenity
* Each character has their own SPESHUL element and color
* Each character has 50+ different attacks and uses them by shouting the name out
* Both series have one character who's [[Loli|younger than everyone else]] and sucks balls

== Her [[L33t]] Skills ==
[[Image:Katspoetry.PNG|thumb|left|Tell us how you REALLY feel, Kat.]]
[[Image:Sonotsailormoonatall.png|thumb|Some of her shit-tastic art of her main [[OC]] that is NOTHING like [[Sailor Moon]] at all.  [[Srsly]], totally not. Also, lens flare ftw?]]
[[Image:TsukinohoshijailbaitOCNOODZ.jpg|thumb|Prepare for [[raep]].]]
[[Image:WHATTHEFUCK.jpg|thumb|Whatever that is hanging from his crotch, it's definitely not a [[dick]]. Tumor, anyone?]]
Besides being a [[weeaboo]] and drawing overly-shiney [[animu]], her anatomy is [[shit]].  Rather than LEARNING how to draw people, she continues to learn how to color.  However, her coloring skills [[phail]] hard, her shading is terrible, and she drowns all of her pictures in sparkles, bubbles, and pretty bright lights.  Therefore, making her pictures look even more like crap. She has also recently discovered DAZ Studio 3, the crappy rendering program all talentless weeabooes use, and can't figure out how to give any of her Mary Sues eyebrows.

Like other fat fucks who will always be virgins, Kat draws terrible attempted porn of her own characters. This is hilarious because she has no fucking clue how to draw vaginas, probably because she's [[Fat|never seen hers]]. She also drew porn of the only main male character, in which his nipples look like Band-aids and his dick is apparently camoflauged. One wonders how long we have until Rule 34 of <strike>Tuxedo Mask</strike> Zoey and <strike>Sailor Moon</strike> Angel Cancer surfaces. As [http://tsukinohoshi.deviantart.com/art/Zoey-and-Ashley-141465508 this pic] showcases, she's getting ever closer to full blown porn. When this happens, however, it will just give trolls more ammo for their [[lulz]] crusade.


All of her [[OC]]s are stereotypical and unoriginal, and she has absolutely no talent in story writing.  She's attempted to write songs before, but they all come out incredibly lame and are so cheesey that you need to read them with a glass of wine.  Apparently, her [[trolls|fans]] take this advice too literally because for anyone to think that her art is remotely good, they'd have to be drunk off their asses.

She also uploads a shitton of pictures every day, so it's obvious that she takes little to no time on them at all.  But that's also obvious just from looking at them, as she has the artistic talent of an autistic 5-year-old.  The only other explanation for her being able to upload that many pictures at that rate would be that she is, indeed, [[God]].

And even though over-exposure to her art would cause any right-minded person to commit suicide, Kat is generous enough to post tutorials for all of you.  That's right, she has coloring tutorials in her [[DevianTART]] gallery and even shows you how to draw her beautiful [[animu]] eyes!!1!11one!!  Isn't that great?!

She also writes poetry and has written quite a few songs for her [[shit]]ty magical girl story, probably incase someone ever comes across it and likes it enough to make it into a real [[anime]].  Of course, that would be another sign of the apocolypse and if that is ever to happen, everyone should panic like hell.  Because, let's face it, that's about as likely as someone actually winning [[the game]].  The songs she has written for the story are also corny, fag-tastic, and enough to make one want to gouge their eyes out with a spork.  A warning should go out to Kat's fans: do not read her songs and poetry for fear of losing what little brain cells you still have left.

Kat probably has no friends and no life, seeing as she uploads AT LEAST one journal entry every day, like people actually care what the fuck she's doing.
Kat also has the tendency to block other people who criticize her art.  Regardless of the fact that she posts her shitty pictures on an art website, if you give her any sort of criticism, she will argue with you.  Then, if you get her angry enough, she will block you and hide all your comments. Conversely, if one were to watch her, Kat would practically piss her pants and then shower praises on you, to the point of NEVER EVER LEAVING YOU ALONE. Because Kat only listens to the people who kiss her ass and tell her how amazing she is and how cute her art is.  So be warned: don't ever tell her you don't like her art or she may block you and then make a big whiney journal about you on her [[DevianTART|DeviantSpace]] page or her [[LiveJournal]]. She also hides her activity on deviantART, probably due to e-paranoia. In short, Kat employs typical retarded tartlet antics and believes that she is lord and master of all that she surveys.

[[Image:What tsukinohoshi wishes she looked like.jpg|thumb|right|What the beast wishes she looked like. Also, apparently she is [[An Hero|a heroine]].]]
Katrina M. Welch is a 22 year old [[Lol_Wut|Janitor]] at Wendy's. If this isn't fail enough, here are some samples from her profile area in convenient condensed form.
<center>{{morphquote|katprofquotes|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;
|'''Nicknames''': Kat, K-Chan, KK-Chan, Kitty, Kitt, Twinkie (cus my skin is golden yellow with brown tints like those twinkie bars), Minnie-mouse (voice is squeaky; have been called that before on several occasions), Tiny, Trinity, Tiger, Chicka (by my spanish friends), Momma (also by spanish friends), Baby Girl, Babe, Pumpkin, and "Beasty" (don't ask...**slaps Ethan** ), Katty Chi or Katty (curtosy of Flora/Jen aka floranaturefairy on DA)|'''Tsukinohoshi''', usually it shouldn't be flattering when people call you [[Fat|"Twinkie"]]

I also believe that Jesus Christ existed and did many wonderful things. I'm not exactly atheist, sense I do believe in something.

Even to this day I still have disproportions and I still need to learn perspective and how to properly shade. Nobody’s perfect|'''Tsukinohoshi''', on her [[fail|mad]] [[shit|skillz]]}}</center>

===Her Friends===
Tsukinohoshi's "friends" on deviantART tiptoe around her like a hibernating bear they're afraid to wake up. Why they even bother to associate with her in the first place is anyone's guess. All of her friends seem to be trying to help her improve her drawing and leave various helpful critiques on her deviations. Despite numerous critiques, tutorials and redlines from her current "main teachers", (~iKiska, ~pink-anthony and *THWT), Kat still fails to learn a single thing. Or read the help given. Or look at it. Their efforts are completely futile because Tsukinohoshi steadfastly ignores all advice and plunges ahead with her badly drawn deformed shiny weeaboo shit.

===Her Partner===
Yes. Another human being is actually allowing Kat to continue with her shitty Zodiac Angels crap. And she's intelligent. And she doesn't suck at drawing. And she's not killing Kat and her awful artwork with fire. What the hell.

{{deviantart|kazeyasha|Kazeyasha}} is supposedly helping Kat develop her Zodiac Angels series. Exactly why is an enigma, since she seems at least twice as intelligent as Kat and draws about 10 times better. She's still a weeaboo faggot though, since her gallery is full of fanart and other retarded things. Apparently Kazeyasha is in charge of creating the villains and ACTUALLY DRAWING THE MANGA. That's right, Kat sucks so hard at drawing that she actually realizes it and wants someone else to draw her shit Sailor Moon-ripoff series FOR HER. Thankfully, no comics have been produced yet and probably never will be, at this rate. Hopefully Kazeyasha still has a chance to get away from Kat before she is crushed by her rolling mounds of fat.

== Someone Bullies Kat, OH NOES ==
[[Image:Someonecallthewaaambulance.PNG|thumb|right|Someone call the waaaambulance.]]
There was recently an incident where a group of [[interwebs]] people were cyber-bullying Kat.  They even sent her their entire chat log in a note on [[DevianTART]].  However, after she threatened to have one of the mods drop the [[banhammer]] on them, they immediately pussed out and apologized.  Here's the entire conversation:
[[Image:BashingKat.PNG]]

== Kat's Reception to [[lying|Honest]] Critique ==
[[Image:really.jpg|thumb|right|Such an understanding person. The world truly does not deserve her radiant presence.]]
Once upon a time, Tsukinohoshi <strike>[http://tsukinohoshi.deviantart.com/journal/27749245/ shouted with glee]</strike> [[Baleeted]] that her mother finally accepted that she just had [[retarded|no patience for math]] and that she could apply to art colleges. A few days later, she made a [http://tsukinohoshi.deviantart.com/journal/27907575/ follow up journal] declaring that she admitted she just couldn't see [[reality|herself getting a job in art]]. Her [[BFF]] Rinnay then decided to nicely break it to her. In a lengthy comment, she suggested that Kat improve her knowledge of anatomy, stop using [[Amuria|dodge and burn]], and said she couldn't believe Tsukinohoshi [[tracing|didn't use references]]. Tsukinohoshi, being the understandable and forgiving [[cunt|saint]] she is, told her that her art wasn't amazing but she wasn't terrible and that she would never stop drawing. Being the [[honest|rude]] ex-friend that this person was, Rinnay told her that she was taking [[butthurt|offense]] when she truly just trying to tell her the truth. Tsukinohoshi, once again being the angel our world needs, tells her that the bitch misunderstood her and told her what she already said: She's still going to draw. What a forgiving and understanding person we have in our terrible world.

</gallery></center>

=== Kat's Reception to [[lying|Honest]] Critique Part 2 ===
One day, terribly insensitive Koshou decided to critique [[retarded|sweet]], [[fat|angelic]] Kat's artwork. When she found out that Kat usually spends an entire hour [[No|working]] on her [[fail|art]], she decided to be a jerk and laugh at her! An hour?! Ha! She told Kat [[truth|lies]] about how real a [[artist]] spends over 100 hours in [[MS Paint]] to obtain true art! But luckily, Kat saw through her lies and told her that she worked very hard during that one hour. Koshou then lies to her again, telling [[slut|poor]] Kat that an hour is not enough time, and to slow down. 
Kat finally has enough of her lies and [[butthurt|blocks her]], successfully saving her gallery from lies! But the terror doesn't stop there! Koshou gets so [[offended]] that she decides to make a journal, gloating over her conquest to terrorize poor Kat. Luckily, [[SailorMercury90|Floranaturefairy]], her new [[BFF]], since Rinnay was too much of a jerkface, comes to save the day! Flora tells everyone to resolve this in a more kind fashion, such as notes, and that making this journal is against the rules of etiquette. But as we know, Koshou was too much of a jerk so Kat had to block her! She also told Flora blasphemous lies about how that rule had changed. Will Sailor Kat and Sailor Flora prevail?! Or will the evil queen known as Koshou succeed?! Find out next time on, Tsukinohoshi's Bullshit!

</gallery></center>

=== The Resolution ===
Finally, poor lil' Kat realized that she had lost the argument, and unblocked her. She then proceeded to make a journal apologizing to Koshou, but the damage was done. Koshou, so [[offended]], told her that she's glad Kat apologized, but [[retarded|"completely missed the point]] [[idiot|and you have yet to take responsibility for anything else that you're doing]], [[ragequit|so I am done with this."]] Kat then told her she would work hard to improve, and so they made up and then got married and had deformed [[lesbian]] babies.

=== LIEK BFFS NAO? ===
The viewing public may not be entirely aware of the current situation between Kat and Koshou, but it seems that they are [[BFF]]s now according to <strike>[http://tsukinohoshi.deviantart.com/art/Gift-Koshou-152249909 this shitty picture]</strike> BAWWWWWWWLEETED.  What seems most likely is that Koshou got tired of Kat calling her mommy Flora to bitch her out for being so mean to her little [[pussy|baby]] and decided to [[lie|apologize]] to get them off of her back.  Kat probably had an [[orgasm]] at that moment from the sheer joy of making a new friend whom she did not realize probably still hates her guts and decided to seal the deal with a [[shit|present]].  We can only hope that this is not the end of the drama, because it is far too entertaining to see Kat bitch and whine when she is being "[[cyber bully|cyber bullied]]".

== No moar dodge tool?! ==
In a recent journal, Tsukinohoshi came down from the heavens and announced that she would no longer be using [[Amuria|the dodge tool]]. Oh noes!! What will Tsukinohoshit do without the dodge tool?!

...No, seriously. She can't figure out how to shade without using the dodge tool.

It all started when Koshou noticed that Tsukinohoshi was using burn like a retard and told her to cut that shit out. Tsukinohoshi immediately got all defensive and unleashed the butthurt:

<center>{{morphquote|burnbabyburn|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;
|lol I don't use the burn tool at all...I even have a WIP kinda thing showing what I do when I color in my gallery, in the WIP section. I hate the burn tool cus it doesn't give me enough control over the colors and often makes them too dark. The only thing I use is the dodge tool for the highlights, set on 20% opacity.|Tsukinohoshi, in denial
|I don't use the burn tool..*sweatdrops*..

Thanks though.|Tsukinohoshi, still in denial
|I DO NOT use the burn tool...just the default brush for shadows, and dodge for highlights. ;;;


Thanks though.|Tsukinohoshi, AW HELL NAW
|Oki, while you guys might not agree with me, i like using dodge. It's the only thing I use when i color though, no burn. I tried other ways to color but I didn't like them as much. Thanks for your advice though.|Tsukinohoshi, [[FYIAD|FUCK YOU I'M SAILOR MOON]]
}}</center>

The same tartlet suggested that she should also lay off the dodge tool or risk becoming the next Amuria, though even Queen SHINY DESU is better than this stupid shit.
Eventually, Tsukinohoshi got sick of people trying to help her improve and posted a journal saying that she would stop using the dodge tool FOREVAR, probably so she could get them all to shut up. However, like a fat crack-addicted whore, she can't stay away from the magical dodge tool, surrepitiously sneaking it into her pictures even though she swears she'll never use it again.

== Tsukinohoshi Says: Plagiarizing is BAD, KIDS!==
In the aftermath of the [[Incarnate]] fiasco, Tsukinohoshi left a [[TL;DR|lengthy]] [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/27612942/1394020259 comment] on Nick Simmons' deviantART page, extolling the virtues of originality and vowing revenge on him. It's good to know that we have a [[Sailor Moon|Pretty Soldier]] of [[Hypocrite|Justice]] on our side.

Some highlights:

<center>{{morphquote|SADNAO|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;
|That's like saying "Oh I'm gonna copy from super man because it's not really that popular or whatever, or [[Hypocrite|i'm gonna copy directly from sailor moon because it's not that popular anymore]]--at least, I THINK it's not. Nobody will notice. I'm gonna copy every comic that came out and every drawing that the artist made."|Tsukinohoshi, maybe you should look at that [[shit|thing]] you call a deviantART page....
|Enjoy your fail.|Tsukinohoshi, how did I /b/tard}}</center>

== ~Deviant-ZAngel: The Account Switch ==
[[image:This is the cancer.jpg|thumb|right| Her "new" style. It still causes seizures and vomiting. WTF is with all the rainbows?!?]] 
[[Last Thursday]], Tsukinohoshi randomly switched accounts to [http://deviant-zangel.deviantart.com/ ~Deviant-ZAngel]. She claims this is because she changed and improved her art style, not making any mention of her trolls or problems with her "friends". [[Lie|Yeah, that's definitely true.]]

Despite these claims, one look at her gallery shows that while her style is indeed slightly different, her drawing ability is still [[shit]].

{{quote|Hey, why the big change? o.o|Random tartlet|on Tsukinohoshi jumping ship}}
{{quote|cus I hated the artwork on my old account. I wanted them gone. :( And they are gone. Yay! <3 I also wanted to start over with this new account <3 my drawing style has changed and I wanted that to reflect in my gallery.|Tsukinohoshi|covering her ass}}

So.... not only does she suck at drawing and taking criticism, she's also too fucking lazy to just delete her deviations. [[A winner is you|A winner is she.]]

Truth of the matter is, Kat moved accounts after an argument with one of her "teachers".
A person who she had blocked commented on one of the redlines that ~pink-anthony had made for Kat.
Kat read the comment conversation between the deviants, assumed they were bitching about her and got as [[butthurt]] as any teenage girl would (OMG LOL SHE'S ACTUALLY 22). She leapt into a long, essay-like, sulky reply, claiming that the worse pain anyone can experience in the world, is the pain of being [[trolled]]. 
Yes guise, trolling iz indeed moar pain that war!!1! 

This self-centred comment sparked off a flame attack on her by several different deviants. Despite her half-arsed apology attempts, no one fully forgave her, because after months of dealing with a stubborn [[12 year old girl]] trapped in the body of a 22 year old woman, who refused to listen, no one gave a flying fuck anymore.

After much sad face emoticons and general fucking around for sympathy, Kat deactivated and set up her new account, claiming she needed a fresh start and wanted to leave her old work behind.
That same day, she set up ~Deviant-ZAngel and proceeded to reload EVERYTHING from =tsukinohoshi back onto it. Progress fail.

It is also obvious that she is still entirely [[butthurt]] by the criticism she has gotten from other deviants, and is terrified of getting more, as she has deactivated adding comments on any of her pictures on this new account.  This is proof that, regardless of the fact that she is trying to prove to others that she and her art have grown and matured, and although she is trying to hide behind a new username so less people will know about her history of [[fail]], she will always be Tsukinohoshit to the world.  We should congradulate Kat for making one of the dumbest moves anyone could have made on the internet ever.  Bravo, Kat.  You win [[internets]].

File:Mrshands.jpg| An example of her "new style". Excepting the thinner lines and somewhat smaller eyes, there's not much different. And what the fuck is wrong with her hands?

File:Hurrrrrr1.jpg|hurrrrrr
File:Shit1.jpg|I honestly could not tell that this was supposed to be "perspective practice". It just looks like she has a [[DERP]] face.
File:FUCKING RAINBOWS.jpg|Why are there so many rainbows?! This isn't [[Robot Unicorn Attack]], bitch!
