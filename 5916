Mac OSX86 is the newest Lulz from of Steve Jobs for cheapos who can't afford a real mac.

==History==

Realising that the Colonial Computer [[OS]] wars was finally coming to a close in the late 1990s with the clear winner, the Republic of [[Linux]] led by fearless leader Debian, [[Steve Jobs]] decided to distract [[Bill Gates]] from stealing the [[IPOD]] by pretending to be working on a platform for virtual [[porn|pr0n]].

==The Stage==

Having buckets loads of [[money|cash]] to put into R&D or let the TAX man get it, Jobs decided to take a proverbial [[piss]] down Bill Gates’s leg. Knowing that creative people such as designer, artists and managers use Mac’s while data entry type people used Windows he had Apple slowly keep it desktop market running.  With that [[slashdot|knowledge]] and a market place that was starting to only pay for content (see [[cell phone|Mobile Phone]]), this left no profit from hardware and underlying software.

Gates not realising that the future of profits from OS would soon [[old|dry]] up continued to [[blackmail]] chipset providers by only offering Microsoft [[Tech support|support]] (or in Linux terms ‘your chipset will be incompatible with Windows’) if they offered drivers for any other software platforms.  

==The Attack==

At the Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2005 the i86 attack was launched.  The ‘i’ (or finger as it become known) attack pathway was initially cleared with the iPOD soon followed with iSoftware which left everbody [[leet|under 25]] with the simple fact that if it doesn’t have an ‘i’ in front its generic. 

The second stage was then to release the i86 computer code named ‘Mini Mac’.  On February 14, 2006 the first Generic version was leaked onto the internets using the ‘[[Ted Stevens|it’s like tubes]]’ protocol.  Within a couple of years of the initial release [[Pwned|i86OSX]] ( 5i + 360 degree + Stealth Kiss) it was supplied with drivers for all [[Pentium|computer hardware]] and was [[free|given away]] in cereal boxes and used to load [[AOL]] software on i86 hardware.

==The [[At least 100 years ago|Aftermath]]== 

*[[crap|Windows]] [[vista|lista’ed]] a bit and became a [[loser|collectors]] item, a bit like old game cartridge images.
*[[Apple]] sold lots more media content.
*[[Linux]] finally got hardware support.
