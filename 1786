'''CorporateSexOffenders.com''' is a spin-off of [[Perverted Justice]], the excellent anti-[[pedophile]] trolling organization. CorporateSexOffenders.com was launched to put pressure on companies, such as [[MySpace]], [[LiveJournal]] and [[YouTube]], that encourage pedophiles to ply their trade online. In un-copyedited legalese, corporate sex offenders are described as 

<blockquote>"Any company who is informed of pedophiles using their service to advocate the lifestyle of child/adult rape which then does not remove the pedophiles from their service (Like [[Ohbutyouwillpet]], whose [[LiveJournal]] is [http://ohbutyouwillpet.livejournal.com still active since 2004] even after being convicted of molesting his son in 2006, [[Lol_wut|LOL WUT?]]). Whereas the advocation of the rape of children sexually is disallowed in 99% of corporate Terms of Service agreements, companies have a responsibility to regulate their services to ensure those advocating pedophilia and acts of pedophilia are removed."</blockquote>

==Wikisposure==
Like the [[Wikichan]] that preceded it, this is a shitty [[MILF]] rip-off of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] that [[Your Mom]] reads. Much more amusing from the perspective of Internets drama is a sub-site of CorporateSexOffenders.com, called the '''Wikisposure''' project. This is nothing less than a wiki dedicated to outing and exposing [[wikipedophile]]s and their activist groups. As the wiki was only launched in June 2007, there is not very much in there at the moment, but it shows potential as a [[tubgirl|whirlpool]] of evolving dramas. Wikisposure isn't working as of November 2010.
