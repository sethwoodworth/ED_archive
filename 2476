Dubious disclaimer
[[Image:Disclaimer.gif|frame|100px|right|How to execute the non-verbal dubious disclaimer.]]

'''Dubious disclaimers''' are disclaimers that mean absolutely nothing when taken in context with what a person is saying.  They are a sad consequence of [[Tolerance|PCism]].  They are largely used by [[racist]]s before telling an off-colour joke, starting their own [[purelily|white supremacist]] website, or talking to the actual [[IRL]] subject of their conversation. These are also called 'hedges' by those whose heads are not securely implanted in their asses. Fuckheads...

==Examples==
* "I'm [[not]] a [[racist]], but..."
** "... [[Niggers]] should all be [[holocaust|thrown into gas chambers]].
* "I'm [[not gay]], but..."
** "... I take it [[in the ass]]."
* "I don't hate [[fag]]s, but..."
** "... they're really only good for tinder."
* "I'm not a [[pedophile]], but..."
** "...I have a twelve gigabyte [[lolicon]] collection.  [[No|Wanna see]]?"
* "Don't take this the wrong way, but..."
** "...I've been assfucking your wife, kids, and pets when you're not around."
* "You're entitled to your opinion, but..."
** "Fuck you man! I fucking love kids' genitalia!"
* "I respect you man.."
** "...but honestly, do everyone a favor and drive a fucking nail through your skull"
* "Everyone's entitled to their own opinion."
** "... except you, you [[faggot]]."
* "I'm not a Retard, but..."
** "...I Frequent the [[Ebaums]] forums."
* "Let's agree to disagree."
* "...[[Bill Clinton|I did not have sexual relations with that woman]]"
* "[[No offense, but...]]"
** "... [[your mom|your mother]] is a whore."
* "I agree with what you're saying, but..."

* "I saw it on TV!"

* "[[Scientology|I'm not a Scientologist, but..."]]
* [[Kanye West|I'm really happy for you, I'll let you finish, but...."]]

==Non-verbal disclaimers==

The non-verbal motion of ''looking over both shoulders'' or ''holding your hand(s)over your mouth'' counts as a dubious disclaimer and also lends the appearance of security to whatever piece of inflammatory information is being passed.
