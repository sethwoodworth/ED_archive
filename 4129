'''Is chat dead?''' is a frequent phenomenon on [[IRC]], where it seems [[noone]] is participating in chat. If chat is dead, it usually is a signal for people to start [[Crapflood|slow flooding]] the channel.

On IRC, conversation often flows very slowly, as if [[retard|people have first learned to type]]. Each bit of sentence may take 30 seconds to several minutes for participants to say, [[Dying alone|causing a brief conversation to consume hours of your life on IRC]].
