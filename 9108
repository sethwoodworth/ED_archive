WishUponAHero
<b>[http://www.wishuponahero.com/ WishUponAHero.com]</b> is the poor man's [[Craigslist]]. Instead of people paying for the things they want, like on Craigslist, on WishUponAHero.com people post what they want, and expect to get these things for [[free]]. The person that provides the free thing to the e-beggar is from then on called a "[[idiot|hero]]".
