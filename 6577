The '''Powerword: Real Name''' is one of the most powerful [[pwnage|spells]] in an [[troll|internet wizard]]'s arsenal. Most people believe that the relative anonymity of the net allows them to indulge their most [[Furry|perverted]] and [[Pedophile|unacceptable]] desires without consequence. However, since these same people are not elite [[hackers]] who have taken [[Computer Science III]], they don't realize how easy it is for a highly motivated team of [[Hackers on Steroids]], like for instance [[Anonymous]] or [[Bantown]], to [[Google|track down]] their [[dox]] and reveal all to the world. 

Revealing to your [[victim]] that you know their Powerword: Real Name will cause them to panic, as they suddenly confront the possibility that their [[Furaffinity]] posts or the [[sick fuck|Eagle-Fox hybrid voraphile porn]] on their [[DeviantArt]] account could be sent to their [[IRL]] co-workers and friends. Their typical reaction will be to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]] - fortunately, most good trolls take [[screenshot]]s. 

Compare for dramatic effect:

;using their handle:
:Wow, [[Tony Sidaway|SexySherilyn17F]], you certainly are fucked up.

;to using their real name:
:Wow, [[Tony Sidaway]], you certainly are fucked up.


The name is fashioned after [[Dungeons & Dragons|D&D]], where several high-level magic-user spells are called "Power Words" because they cause a given effect with just a single word (''[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/powerwordkill.htm power word kill]'' being the most [[1337]].)

According to the [[secret policy document]] owned by [[LJ Abuse]], but not the actual [[LJ TOS]], using a person's real name on LJ is a [[ban|suspendable]] offense. 

Of course, this only works if their real name is genuine and not a clever decoy.
