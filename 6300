'''Paul''' was an English psychic [[Cthulhu|octopus]] beloved by [[4chan]]'s /[[sp]]/artans, who lived at the Sea Life Aquarium in Oberhausen of [[Germany]], that had been employed to pick the winners during the [[2010 World Cup]]. His selections during the round-robin, group play and quarter-finals have been right on-the-money 100% of the time making him moar successful than every single sportscaster and [[Usi|self-proclaimed "expert"]] thus far. He was also 80% at the Euro 2008. 

Before Germany's games, Paul was offered identical foodz in two identical perspex boxes decked out with the national flag of [[Germany]] and their opponent. It is a known [[fact]] that Paul made [[Vegas]] bookies [[shit bricks]].

Paul made all of [[Germany]] [[U MAD|furious]] when he predicted that [[Spain]] would beat them, but redeemed himself somewhat by picking the Germans to win the [[Losers|3rd Place]] game against [[Team Uruguay]]. Again, Paul was correct. He then went above and beyond the call of duty by picking [[Spain]] to beat [[Dutchland]] in the final, his first attempt at picking a match winner that didn't involve [[Germany]]. 

A [[boring|close match]] went into extra-time after being tied 0:0 at the end of regulation and given that the [[Dutch]] seemed hellbent on proving Paul wrong by attempting to [[cripple]] every Spanish player to win, people began to have their doubts. Never bet against Paul though. With a [[perfect]] record on the line, Paul psychically took over Spain's [[hero|Andrés Iniesta's]] brain and gave him the power to score the game winner as the clock ran out. Paul finished the World Cup 8 for 8 (a win for each [[tentacle]]), the chances of which is [[EPIC|1/256]]

Given Paul's amazing record, one wonders how Paul's [[1337]] octopus powers would fare in matters of global importance such as [[cut]] vs. [[uncut]] debates and [[USA]] vs. [[EU]] [[flamewar]]s on [[4chan]].

[[Goodnight Sweet Prince|Paul was found dead on 26th of October 2010.]] The management of the Sea Life Aquarium insits that it was a natural death - Paul was nearly 3 years old and with that a geriatric octopus. However, we assume that an assassination is being hushed over. Either way, the world lost a great mind and a true hero. Paul was definitely the biggest star and best thing about the 2010 World Cup and will be missed by everyone...except for the [[butthurt]] [[Hollish]].

Mani the Psychic [[Parakeets|Parakeet]] from [[Singapore]] has [http://g.sports.yahoo.com/soccer/world-cup/blog/dirty-tackle/post/Now-there-s-a-psychic-parakeet-to-worry-about?urn=sow,254871 other ideas though], picking the '''Hollish''' (aka the '''Netherish''') of '''Dutchland''' to [[pwn]] the Spaniards. Pretty ballsy for a fucking [[bird]] from a country that doesn't have a world-class football squad. Since Paul > Mani, you can [[disregard|disregard him cos he sucks cocks]].
