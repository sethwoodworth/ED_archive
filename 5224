'''Mason Reed''' is 30 year old, [[Existentialist]] and host of [http://ustream.tv/channel/this-is-mason This is Mason dot com]. He broadcasts from "the ranch" somewhere in Los Angeles, where he lives. He plays a 1979 Guild and is the embodiment of The Dude. 
== Rise to e-fame ==

Late on the night of [[last thursday|Thursday, August 2, 2007]] [[at least 100]] [[Anonymous]] randomly selected an unwitting ustreamer to raid. Mason, who's show rarely tops 15 viewers, suddenly had 250. This was thanks largely to [[4chan]]'s [[b/|/b/]], who proceeded to go completely [[batshit]] over this obscure and [[fat|out of shape]] individual.

While it is true that [[Anonymous]] is legion, as countless anon repeated over the course of the night, are they as powerful as they claim? The raid was essentially unsuccessful, as many anon thoughtlessly broke [[rules 1 and 2]] and even went as far as to give Mason meme lessons. Anonymous seems to have a strange soft spot for mason, just as many b/tards have a soft spot for furry porn. 

Mason declined to answer regarding his ownership of a [[dog]], but it is [[true|established knowledge]] that he has curtains. This may account for Anonymous's epic failure in raiding him.

== Sociological experiment? ==
Many callers were greeted by Mason informing them that the show is a [[It was a social experiment|social experiment]]. This is [[bullshit]], as [[noone|everyone]] knows that the only people who use live video streams are [[attention whores]], and that this "social experiment" was in reality a form of [[attention whore|attention whoring]] his [[shitty|band]].

== ANY FRIEND OF MASON IS A FRIEND OF ANON ==

At first, when [[faggot|Andy]] came on Masons show Anon was displeased. But after hearing [[faggot|him]] say [[baby fuck|shrimp on the barby]] Anon was pleased. Anon approves. Andy plays the [[Australia|didgeridoo]], like all Aussies. He is 26 and Mason likes to record in his garage.

Perry is a fucking queer and likes to say "dethu dethu dethu".

Penelope is Perry's [[Not gay|girlfriend]]. She is 22 and always wears "Thank You" shirts.

On August 7 a 24 year old trap by the name of Joule has entered the arena!

It has recently come to anon's attention that Andy Cockmuncher has a ustream show. It is your patriotic duty to troll [http://ustream.tv/channel/andys-garage it] heavily.

Andy is currently pleased with the gay robot wizards he keeps in his room.

Hootie is Mason's black friend. Unlike Mason, he does, in fact, own a dog.

The Hawk is a pirate who lives in space.  Underneath his [[Pirate|eye patch]] is a dimensional gateway that he uses to trap his enemies in.  It is rumored that they remain in the pocket dimension until they starve and die.

== Mason and Andys Covers ==

On August 8th, Mason and Andy got really drunk and took /r/ from anon for songs. Album released in the shops by Christmas!

Here are some that were recorded. Sorry they are in .WAV but my computer was being faggoty and wouldn't export them as .MP3 so fucking deal with it!

== Mason Specific Memes ==

=== Barrel Roll ===

Unlike [[faggot|Tom Green]], Mason is an excellent barrel roller. He also [[rickroll]]ed and rainrolled and nomirolled 300 anonymous at once. He very well may be an Anonymous in disguise. 

=== Is this Poison? ===

Mason's Ex-Manager Perry(The asshole was wearing glasses, a hat and some other gay shit to protect him from the fumes from the California fire, what a pussy) came to his house to be on the experiment, after fagging it up and pissing anonymous off, he got butt raped and fired. While Anonymous was trolling via cellphone using music, Perry asked "IS THIS POISON?" and it is now a meme.

=== Panama ===

Did somebody say... Panama?

== Paul Jamrock ==

Paul Jamrock is as mysterious as he is handsome.
