Circumlolcution
[[Image:Snorri.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Snorri Sturlason proposed the first circumlolcution, by describing shitty poetry as Eagle-shit.]]

'''Circumlolcution''' is a [[gay|crucial]] form of poetic diction in the art of shitty [[poetry|emo poetry]]. The base of a circumlolcution is an old – or forced – meme, which is then lulzified by describing it in terms of any other more lulzy memes to which it relates. Therefore, [[longcat]] may be referred to by the genitive phrase “Bane of [[Tacgnol]],” or its ancient poetic name of “Stretch-Puss”.

== Making Circumlolcutions for [[fail|Fun]] and [[AIDS|Profit]]!!!! ==
* 1)	Pick a [[meme]], any meme
* 2)	Consider a way in which the concepts associated with it might be described metaphorically (e.g., “[[EFG|Bearer of Fail]]”, “[[Party Van|Permaban’s Steed]]”, “[[Furries|Fucking Furries]]”)
* 3)	Post it on /b/ until everyone’s sick and fucking tired of it
* 4)	[[%3F%3F%3F%3F|????]]
* 5)	[[PROFIT|PROFIT]]
