FOB
'''F.O.B.''' (pronounced ''eff-oh-bee'') is a stereotype that emerged in Vancouver, Canada in the 90's after a massive influx of [[Azn]]s, [[Pakis]], [[India|binders]], and [[Iran]]ians. Due to Iranians being the most retarded, the term was later used exclusively on them. It stands for Fresh off the boat (later simplified to 'Faab', for white people who found it didn't quite roll off the tongue, and later to 'Fresh'), the implication being that the smelly fucktards couldn't afford a plane ticket.

Fobs are easy to spot, having a full grown beard by the age of 13, possessing incredibly vulgar names such as Akbar or Abdul, and having a propensity to mispronounce silent consonants (How-var-you?)
