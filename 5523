'''Mrpunk2u''' is the star of a [[Fake internet deaths|fake death]] drama.  He also evidently thinks he is a [[negro]], which is clearly not the case.

On December 11th, 2004, someone claiming to be '''saidforfake''' posted a message in '''Mrpunk2u''''s journal claiming that '''mrpunk2u''' had died after his truck flipped over late at night on December 10th.

On December 12th 2004, '''mrpunk2u''' made another post letting everyone know that he was, in fact, still alive, and really, really pissed.  

To this day, no one has seemed to care about any of [[shit nobody cares about|this]].
