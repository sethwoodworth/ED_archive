[[Image:Plymouth org blacked out.jpg|thumb|right|The Plymouth Org now has black-out [[lulz|curtains]]]]

'''Vicky Boyce''' (born Esther Finkelstein)  is the ugly [[Scilon]] bitch in charge of Scientology in [[Thanksgiving|Plymouth]], [[England]].  The Plymouth operation of [[Project Chanology]] rose to prominence due to the considerable wins produced by [[Stu Wyatt]]
and his [http://www.youtube.com/user/PlymouthScientology PlymouthScientology YouTube Channel].  The dedication should come as no surprise to [[you|anyone]] considering that Stu's father is a [[psychiatrist]], and his mother is a [[Marcab|tax-collector]]. Her official post title is Hive Mother, Plymouth. In her free time she likes to gut fish.

The Plymouth Scientology Org Staff have been responsible for [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nff14bcv5FY assault], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t44vGY3spo bullbaiting] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85SeyR29PKc numerous] attempts at [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqPaD-htWSk dead agenting], and finally [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA0L_ICdz-I stealing pickets signs and assaulting Stu as he attempted to recover them]. 

===Theft and Assault===

On the last day of May, 2008, Vicky was frustratedly offering free stress tests to the disapproving citizens of Plymouth, while [[Stu Wyatt|Stu "Killdozer" Wyatt]] and a few other [[SP]]s peacefully protested nearby. Because of his health, Stu rides a motorized scooter. Suddenly, Vicky became highly enturbulated and stole the protest signs from Stu and his posse.

===Lo-Speed Chase===

With Stu and the gang in hot pursuit, videotaping everything, Vicky stormed back to the "org", trying to ditch them along the way by going through a large indoor shopping center. This only made the incident funnier, as Stu loudly introduced her to all the shoppers, '''"This is Vicky Boyce, a scientologist, a thief and a liar. She has stolen our protest signs."'''

===Sclilons Love Hurting Cripples===

At one point, still inside the shopping center, and still on camera, James May's deformed brother Vicky assaulted Stu. Eventually she made it back to the "org," where she got on the telephone and tried to look like she was [[having a wonderful time]]. Meanwhile, Stu asked the police to come over. The punchline is that Vicky was actually surprised when the police took the signs from her and gave them back to Stu.

=Hans Beekmans=

[[Image:Hans.png|thumb|Clever Hans]]

'''Hans Beekmans''' is a [[Dutch]] [[Scientology|Scilon]], and one of the [[Jan Maturbongs| many angry ones]] they've got over there. He is allegedly an "OT V," which means he knows about [[Xenu]] and a lot of the other especially [[Bullshit|krazie stuff]] and is hangin' in there. Hans formerly had the prestigious position of dentist to the Dutch Royal Family. Hans was a Scilon with ambition though - just imagine the prestige if he was the first cult member to bag a member of a royal family! A Scilon on the throne, and all thanks to him!

Highly predictably, the Queen of Holland took about twenty minutes to get sick of his Rasputin shit and being asked if she'd seen Battlefield Earth, and he was promptly b& from the household.

===U Verzonken Mijn Slagschip!===

During a mini-raid on the Amsterdam Sci{b}Org, Hans became highly [[butthurt|enturbulated]] (not supposed to happen with these high-level OT dipshits) and broke [[Anon]]'s movie camera.

=Annette Refstrup=

[[Image:Annette_Refstrup.jpg|thumb|right|Annette Refstrup as seen just after the assault took place]]
'''Annette Refstrup''', yet another $cifag and enemy of [[Anonymous]]. Annette Refstrup is a highly non-important person and is found at the bottom of Denmark's Scientology pyramid hierarchy. On 19 April 2008, in the midst of Scientology's "Book-a-thon" campaign to sell more Dianetics books, Refstrup assaulted a member of Anonymous in broad daylight in Copenhagen, Denmark while the Anonymous was waiting for /b/lackup. 

==="Clawed And Scratched"===

[[Some argue]] that she approached him with a glass of milk and cookies in search for a partner for casual sex, while the Anonymous politely declined her offer. According to the police report, however, Refstrup clawed and scratched at the arm of Anonymous while forcefully trying to take pictures of him.

While Annette Refstrup is not out [[Child Abuse|doing her duty for the Scientology]] cult she is often seen enjoying reading, large [[Marijuana|spliffs]] and [[gang-bang sec-check]]s in Christiania, Copenhagen. Favorite books include ''Mein Kampf, The Communist Manifesto and Excuse Me!: A Little Book of Manners'' by Karen Katz.

=Toni Chambranis=

[[Image:Osa2182.gif|thumb|left|250px|Toni is in ur rAIDS doin' her invest werkz for OSA]]
[[Image:Bfacedlady.png|260px|thumb|right|Toni doing her trademark B Face for NYC ANONS]]
[[Image:Bfaceposter.jpg|260px|thumb|right|Toni being forced meme'd by [[New York Nurse]]]]
Toni Chambranis or [[BFace Lady]] as she is affectionately known in New York City is a member of the [[spy|Office of Special Affairs]].  As one might expect from her moniker, she became internets famous because of her passing facial resemblence to [[ಠ_ಠ|certain numeric characters of ancient Canada.]]

===[[Cloverfield|IS THAT HER HEAD?]]===

In her capacity as an [[Scientologist|idiot]] Toni Chambranis is part of the super secret team which polices the Internet for anyone dissenting against [[Scientology]] and employs a number of tactics such as [[trolling]] to put down said dissent.  Toni uses the skills of people like Lynn Farney from Los Angeles, Gloria Idda and [[terryeo]] to troll the Internet.

=== Personal Life ===

Toni is the brother of Jay Spina, an [[Scientologist|idiot]] who works at the New York Organization and has chiropractic business in NYC.  She is twice divorced and relies heavily on a diet of roaches and ramen noodles.  She has only one known friend, a mysterious woman by the name of Deb Kaiser who apparently is a [[slut]] and uses her sex powers to help Toni do investigations on [[Anonymous]] in NYC through the Connecticut DMV.

===Midlife Crisis (aka ''Joining [[Scientology]]'')===

Travolta became a Scientologist after his TV told him it would be a good idea.  He had been looking for direction ever since his movies ''Grease'' and ''Saturday Night Fever'' completely flopped, and he found it in the form of paying people to evict alien squatters from his derelict dockfront warehouse of a body.  It is estimated that Travolta has purchased [[over 9000|one billion]] dollars worth of Scientological [[shit|horse shit]].

Shortly after joining, Travolta auditioned for the role of [[Goatse]] man but lost out to Rob Schneider.  That's why to this day he only performs in movies based on the writings of L. Ron Hubbard, like ''Battlefield Earth'', ''The Passion of the Christ'', and ''Throw Mama from the Train''.

=Pat Harney=

[[Image:Pat jones.jpg|thumb|right|Pat Harney showing off her weev-do before spouting out more lying bullshit]]

'''Patricia Harney''' is a member of Scientology's [[Office of Special Affairs]] and a [[camwhore|PR Slut]] for the Church of Scientology.  Nothing Pat Harney ever says on television or the radio is ever true, evidenced by her claim there were more [[black people]] receiving auditing than white when most of them are too poor to afford [[Bike|bikes.]] In fairness, the claim probably stemmed from a her marriage to a [[Nigra]] named Mike Harney - seeing as how she can't tell those damn ne-groes from each other, she just assumed that every time she did her husband it was a different man. 

===Life-Ruining Marital Betrayal===

Originally, her name was Pat Jones but she consumed Mike's name after their marriage, also soul and career. The former was down to her being a [[GoddessMillennia|Soul Reaver.]] The later occurred five years ago when she caught him cheating with a pretty young Scilon clerk and decided to get her revenge and protect her PR career at the same time.

She ratted him out to the Rehab Squad, and he remains there to this day.

=Anti Wilford Brimley=

[[Image:AWB1.JPG|thumb|right|275px|Anti Wilford Brimley standing in front of a wall at the 10th Feb IRL [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY|Project Chanology]] Raid.]]
'''Anti Wilford Brimley''' (AWB) works for the Church of Scientology of Portland (Oregon) as a security guard. He is an evil clone of Wilford Brimley, made apparent by his identical appearance. 

===International Man of Marcab?===
Anti Wilford Brimley was first encountered at the 10th Feb IRL [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY|Project Chanology]] Raid. Anti Wilfred Brimley would infect people with [[Diabeetus|diabeetus]] whenever they touched the wall of the Church of Scientology building. Anti Wilford Brimley carries a [[Death Note|small black notebook]] with him at all times. He writes down the license plates of Anonymous members. At the 15th March IRL raid, AWB refused a slice of [[delicious cake]], resulting in minor skirmishes with anonymous picketers. AWB is generally considered to be a neutral party. He defended anonymous to the police at one point. AWB was absent at the May 10th protest.

===Trivia===
*Anti Wilford Brimley has an ornate mustache because he cant grow a full beard like [[Wise beard man|WBM]]
*Anti Wilford Brimley and Wilford Brimley will one day do battle, and decide whether diabeetus is good (the funny outweighs the pain) or bad (vice-versa)

=Sean Stubblefield=

[[Image:Stubblespace.png|thumb|Sexy shot of the "philosopher poet"]]
[[Image:Stupidtrekkie.jpg|thumb|Yes, he's a "Trekkie"]]

[[Sean Stubblefield]] is an airhead [[Burning Man|"New Age"]] dumbshit in [[Texas]] with a huge case of [[unwarranted self-importance]]. In May, 2008, he wrote what amounts to [http://newsblaze.com/story/20080515165650sean.nb/newsblaze/OPINIONS/Opinions.html an "opinion" column] about [[Project Chanology|Anonymous vs. Scientology]] on a "news" web site that is probably read by [[Noone|50 or 60 people]]. For an unknown reason, though, this site is indexed in Google News. Thus, a search in Google News for recent articles mentioning "Scientology" produced Stubblefield's little piece.

While Stubblefield himself does not seem to be a Scilon, he is strongly in favor of them. More accurately, he just wanted to write something, chose a topic he knew little about, and decided to "back the underdog" in an article showing the rhetorical brilliance one might expect to see in a [[13 year old boy]]. Yet Stubblefield is 35 years old.

===Why SHOULDN'T Scientology Make A Profit?===

'''Here are some delightful examples of Stubblefield's scintillating wit.'''

<blockquote>This article I refer to complains of Scientology being an extortion cult. But I submit that such a claim can justifiably be said against Christianity. Does not Christianity also exhibit the traits of a cult? Indeed, IS just as much a cult as Scientology? Does Christianity not exploit the susceptibility and fear inherent in the faith to separate parishioners from their money to support "the church"? Does not Christianity also manipulate and magistrate the beliefs of their followers? Why do we not bring as much criticism against Christianity for the same "crimes"?</blockquote>

'''Ummm... It's fine not to like Christianity, but this is an exceptionally weak comparison.'''

<blockquote>I admit Scientology tends to be a litigious organization, and that-YES-it has the financial resources to do so. In large part because of their member donations/fees. '''And why shouldn't Scientology make a profit from services rendered?''' You pay high fees to therapists for their counseling services. Consultants, advisors and motivational speakers aren't cheap, either. Aren't many Churches also operated as a business? Is Christianity any less of a business? And while I abhor the litigious approach to problem solving, I can understand why they use it. Because in this world, money talks. With all the assaults on Scientology, it is only reasonable that they would want to defend themselves against defamation and censure. What better way to hurt/deter their opponent than by suing?</blockquote>

'''No comment is really necessary; 35 year old man is flat-out retarded.'''

===Beam Me Up, Tom!===

It is not a long article, but it is packed very densely with stupid ideas. A little "bio" at the end tells us about this great thinker:

<blockquote>''Currently based in Houston Texas, Sean Stubblefield graduated [[ITT Tech|Sam Houston State University]] with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in [[Television]] Production. [[Unwarranted self-importance|A philosopher poet]], Stubblefield has been writing non-fiction for 15 years, and has [[lolwut|penned]] eight books to date. [[Shit nobody cares about|His first book, Paradox: A Journey Inside Out]] is available today. For More Information: www.myspace.com/exastral''</blockquote>

===This Just In: Dead Babies Funnier Than Old People===

Like most 35 year old men in Texas, [http://www.myspace.com/exastral Stubblefield has a MySpace page]. Unlike those other Texas men, who use these pages to cheat on their wives and meet [[loli]], Stubblefield's MySpace exists to showcase his poetry and other deep thotts. Here is a sample of this:

<blockquote>It is tragedy when a child dies? How much more tragic it is to reach old age without having lived! Potential denied? What of potential squandered? How awful to have merely existed, simply going through the motions! How terrible to find out that you are not yourself, you are what the world has made of you; not a person, but a placeholder in an assigned role.</blockquote>

Boom! Headshot. I feel enlightened now! Actually [[Megan Meier|I just want to kill myself]]. I wonder if anyone in history has ever before known and written such profound wisdom?Impossible! This man is a fucking [[retard|genius]].

'''Gavino Idda''' is an asshole and [[truther|Internet Terrorist]] who is employed by the [[Scientology|Cult of Scientology]] in Hollywood California.  He is considered widely to be the man in charge of all black-PR operations for [[Scientology|the cult]] on the Internet and has committed numerous acts through agents or through his own doing that make him a '''HUGE''' [[faggot]]
