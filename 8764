Vanity Page
[[Image:Vanity Deleted.PNG|thumb|350px|So common it has it's own deletion category.]]

As [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] increases in popularity, many wannabe trolls think it would inflate their [[e-penis]] to have an article written about them. <b>Vanity Pages</b> are articles created with the intention of making the subject more popular and [[internet famous]].

==Vanity Whores==
Vanity whores come in three flavours:

*<b>The Advertiser</b>
Tries to get advertising to [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] without paying. These users are spotted instantly and swiftly crushed under the [[banhammer]].

*<b>The Self-deprecator</b>
This sub-breed tries to write their own article on how [[truth|stupid and unfunny]] they are before the EDiots find and start spamming the shit out of them. Their article are soon deleted and their userpage splattered with [[1man1jar]].

On rare occassions however their articles are good enough to keep. Some people throw themselves into the deep end and think this will instantly make them into [[internet celebrities]]. Unable to handle the sudden influx of [[trolls]], their plan backfires and they quickly [[delete fucking everything]].

*<b>The Internet Celebrity</b>
The worst breed of all - these people have no sense of shame whatsoever cannot tell the difference between being famous (where people recognise and seek them out to congratulate them) and being infamous (where people recognise and seek them out to tear out their intestines). These users thrive on this attention and simply refuse to set themselves on fire as everybody wishes they would. Such users are more likely to be [[fundies]] and think having an [[ED]] article automatically makes them [[lame|edgy and misunderstood]].

==The [[Evolution]] of the Vanity Page==
<small>NOTE: Not all [[attention whores]] complete all three stages. Some will slink off after stage two, others will skip straight to stage three.</small>

Attention whores react to their page in three stages:

<b>1. Outrage</b>
<br>
Threats of legal action and e-lawyers come spam up the talkpages of all the major sysops. The subject will then upload video on how they are going to sue [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] and fill up their [[deviantart]] account with [[hate art]].


<b>2. HAHA DISREGARD THAT I LIEK IT REALLY</b>
<br>
In complete contrast to the above the subject will then [[lie|claim to have a sense of humour and find their article really funny]]. Attempts to have their page deleted will slowly grind to a halt and they will posts the link to their article on every available site.


<b>3. [[SSP]]</b>
<br>
The experienced attention whore will then upload embarressing and personal information about themselves under the delusion that their [[ED]] article is now their [[livejournal]].

==[[EDiots]] & [[Dramacrats]]==

[[You]] may have noticed that several ED [[sysops]] (and ex-sysops) have their own vanity page. Unlike other users however, they have [[hypocrite|perfectly valid reasons]] for creating their articles. Like all ED articles their pages are dedicated to showing how [[lulz|pitifully pathetic]] the life of the average [[basement-dweller|internet user]] is, thus proving even ED [[veterans]] cannot avoid being laughed at, [[Girlvinyl|with a few exceptions]].

Since the creation of [[ED Forums]], vanity pages created by and dedicated to ED users has been on the rise. Oddly enough, ED users who laugh at sad, deluded [[lolcows]] being harassed by [[trolls]] (some [[Nikki Catsouras|worse than others]]) think creating a page about themselves is an [[Asking for it|excellent idea]].
