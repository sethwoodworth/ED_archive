Defriend

To "[[defriend]]" is to remove someone from your [[Friends list]] on any one of the many [[circle jerk|social networking]] sites that plague the internet (like those nasty lesions on [[your mom|your mother's]] naughty bits); it is tantamount (especially in the case of [[Livejournal]]) to "throwing down the gauntlet" and declaring one's [[friend]]ship at an end. Unsurprisingly, many people consider defriending a severe blow to their pride and reputation, and thus the act of defriending tends to stir up a lot of [[Internet drama]]. 

Outside of [[Livejournal]], it is a useful method of clearing the [[shit|detritus]] that clogs one's [[funnelgirl|Facebook]] or [[USI|Twitter]] feed.  Defriending [[Myspace]] "friends" is pointless, as only [[spam|shitty local bands]] and [[whores|aspiring models/actresses]] still use Myspace, and would hardly notice as neither of the aforementioned possess anything resembling [[emo|human feelings]].

In any case, whether for the sake of [[lulz]] or [[butthurt|perceived offense]], defriending is always [[awesome]]-- even when it happens to [[you]].

The typical [[16_year_old_girls|LiveJournal User's]] response to defriending is [[defamation]] of the offending party, followed by [[Attention Whore | attention whoring]] in an attempt to regain lost prestige or self-worth. In severe cases, threats of [[suicide]] are bandied about and claims of horrid [[disease]]s are made. [[Insane | Less stable]] victims of defriending usually post not only to LJ about the incident, but also talk about it endlessly on [[IRC]] and [[AIM]]. Particularly vindictive individuals, meanwhile, will often attempt to build conspiracies against offending party, working behind their backs to plot revenge, social ostracism and worse.

Though many defriended [[LJ user]]s like to craft complex reasons or motives for their removal (the more elaborate the motive, the more important the defriended user feels), in reality they were usually defriended because their posts were boring, or the defriender grew tired of ceaselessly validating their existence. Indeed, the act of defriending usually causes more [[drama]] than the reasons behind the actual act itself.
