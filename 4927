Lol
{{lowercase}}

'''Lol''', the most abused abbreviation on the [[internet]].  But what does it mean?  Usually one of these:
# Lack of Laughter
# I have nothing worthwhile to contribute to this conversation
# I'm finished typing my sentence now.(opposite of [[RAWR]]. Also more common than [[RAWR]].)
# Laugh out loud, or laughing out loud for people that are new to the internet.
# I'm scratching my balls and not actually smiling or making any sound but typed it anyway.
# Lots of laughter/laughs (but those who think so are [[ghey]])
# Also used when [[you]] say something unfunny and everyone else pities you.
# Lots of [[lulz]], i.e. [[Fox News|a corruption of lol.]]
# Lots of love <3 (is this supposed to be a heart or a ball sack?)
# Lots of loli
# [[Christfag|Love our Lord]]
# Lots of Liquor
# Lets Order Linguine 
# Lots of luck (Stock market talk. Usually indiscernible from laugh out loud, as the majority of the Stockhouse [[users]] are faggots. Has been used by Stockhouse users [[for at least 100 years]].)
# Fun, though only if it originates from [[Dutch]]fags. Why? Because fun is lol in Dutch.

Lol is also spelled [[longcat|ELLOWELL]], [[Arab|El-O'elh]], and [[lollerskates|lolololololol]]
