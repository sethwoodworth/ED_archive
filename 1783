'''Corinna Fugate''' (August 22nd?, 1981) is another overrated Internet diva who dropped off the face of the planet in 2008, and reappeared in 2009 claiming she had legally changed her name to '''Rose Mercury'''.  No, I'm not kidding you.  With her flair for the dramatic and penchant for all things [[homo]], one can't help but wonder if this isn't some sort of sick [[Freddie Mercury]] impersonation.  At one point, her only claim to fame was her [[over nine thousand]] MySpace friends, but now she doesn't even have that since she decided to commit e-suicide and delete all of her profiles, sending her shit-for-brains fans into a flailing, screaming, hilarious emo-orgy.

== Who really cares anymore? ==
[[Image:HeathandCorinna-1.jpg|thumb|Corinna before she started wearing wigs.]] 

Corinna started out her career whining for attention, and pretty much has continued whining her way back up from career suicide.  She's thrown her own pity parties for everything from her dad dying 100 years ago to Anne Frank just to get attention.  She must have finally realized nobody really gave a shit about some faggy dead trumpeter and has moved on to mostly complaining and whining about her dead "boyfriend", who shot himself in the face when he couldn't take listening to her sing one more note.

Over the years, she has also taken to defending people who fall into two categories: People that don't really need it, and people that don't really deserve it.  Most of this is for asspats, so every last one of her retarded MySpace friends can flock to her side and tell her how wonderful she is for sticking up for whores and corpses.  Some of these lucky individuals include [[Jesus]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Tori Amos]], [[Anne Frank]], [[God]], Anne Boleyn, Marie Antoinette, basically any woman that has ever been beheaded ever for being a gluttonous, greedy, cheating slut, [[Asa Coon]] (YES REALLY), faeries/fairies (like magical, imaginary shit, not queers), and also fairies as in queers, homos, fudgepackers and ass-rammers.

In her free time, she also posts blogs about her mental illness and imaginary hospitalizations.  She likes to fake exhaustion, since that's what the big celebrities do, pretend to have breakdowns and then whore all over MySpace for people to send her "comments and positive energy".  At least she's asked people to stop praying for her.  Oh wait, no she hasn't.  What she doesn't understand is that many of us do pray for her, every night, that she will finally be smote by God and given the gift of common sense, which she will then use to justify [[an hero]].  DO IT WHORE.

== Paranoid Schizophrenia ==
[[Image:Corinnfugate_antoinette.jpg|thumb|Corinna after she started wearing wigs.  MMM delicious fatback.]]  As is typical of [[crazy]] folks, Corinna is pretty sure the entire world is out to get her.  Except for those [[over 9,000]].... wait.  Over 1,000 MySpace friends.  She's had run-ins with everyone from little green men to mean ass pagan bitches tryin' to take over her creative license, man.  And then those record companies, man, at least 3 a week must just come a-knockin' on her door trying to get her to sign over her creative abilities so they can turn her into a corporate pawn.

She keeps her [[internet lawyer]] on speed-dial, and between getting beamed up and having conversations with Jesus, she searches the internet for haters so she can [[internet lawyer|take them down]].  Whenever her [[internet lawyer|Harvard Law graduate lawyer]] isn't able to scare the bejesus out of her intended victims, she'll simply rally her army of fanfags and sic them on whoever it is that wrote something even slightly unflattering about her.  Unfortunately for her, only 4% of her fans are not [[retard|retarded]], so her army generally scatters the first time an ice cream truck drives by.  The hills will ring with the cream-thirsty cries of 'tards as they chase the ice cream truck clapping and fighting over quarters.  The remaining 4% will inevitably have a deeply philosophical conversation, in which they will ask, "What is life without Prozac?", and quote Hot Topic novelty t-shirts to one another until the sun goes down, at which they will transform into raging [[Twilight]] fans and start slitting their wrists.  Then the blood-orgy will commence, and when it is all over, they will spoon each other and cry.

Corinna's final and most impressive weapon is the almighty MOMMY.  Being fragile and retarded as she is, her mother often takes pity on her and stands up for her.  Rumor has it her mother is secretly a dragon, as her blood-thirsty, bitchy, white-trash warcries shake the very "foundations" of the trailer park she lives in.  At least, this is what Corinna tells everyone to scare the shit out of them before she pumps herself full of Thorazine and runs through the rainbow clouds to Hever Castle.

In reality, if Corinna/Rose Mercury could hold it together for even a week and appear even somewhat normal, she'd be a pretty compelling cult-leader.  She almost was, when she had [[over 9,000]] MySpace friends.  Too bad she didn't know the cult-leader is supposed to make their followers drink the Kool-Aid before the cult-leader does.

== Jesus Saves The Day ==
Corinna - determined to make sure all the Mexicans on MySpace are belong to her - rounded up her army of funky [[goth|goths]], [[fag|fags]], and [[hippy|hippies]] to rally them against "that [[cunt|woman]]", claiming that she was attempting to scam Corinna's fans out of their hard-earned welfare checks!

But then she decided to totally disrespect all of her friends, and their various religions by filling up her [[MySpace|MyGays]] [[blog]] with a bunch of crap about [[rainbow]], including a video and some [[porn|imagery]] religious Christian shit, which she masturbates to nightly. She then created a [[MySpace|MyGay]] community dedicated to Jesus; using it to ramble on a bit about how she's such a Christian, nearly martyr-like, because some people on the Internets were like "lulz Jesus lovers r gay."

The rest of us are just waiting until [[God|G-Dawg]] sees fit to smite MySpace much like He saw fit to smite [[New Orleans]] (y'know, the moist black person infested fuck hole of North America), as MySpace has twice the gay population [[New Orleans|LA]] had. We all know that [[God]] hates queers, and that's why He sent Hurricane Katrina.  

(Whether or not He let Pat Robertson drive the stupid thing up and down the French Quarter like a beat-up PimpMobile is another thing altogether.)  

And once this occurs, there is no doubt that Corinna will become [[an hero]].

In the next life Corinna plans to release a CD with each song of the album going into great detail about how she loved [[Jesus]] in her past [[otherkin|faerie]] life; how His being crucified, like, totally crushed her soul and made her heart turn black; how she cuts herself and cries herself to sleep every night in this life - at least until Jesus returns, AND HE TOTALLY WILL.

== Peter Pan's Best Friend ==
When the tics subsided, Corinna knew she had to keep the shit storm brewing if she wanted to throw the INS off the track of the illegal Mexicans continuing to cross the border into her back yard. For without her army of [[beaner|beaners]] working 24 hours a day (will work for rice, muthafucka!) to spam PedoSpace, she could climb to the top of the Internet popularity contest. But eventually the INS found out about her tricksy scheme; in a lulzy example of why it isn't good to break the law, they deported her pets to [[Auschwitz|Mexico]]. Corinna - absolutely terrified of her position among emo whores; cutters; faggots, and shooting practice targets for Chris Hansen being threatened as a result of this - knew there was only one way to save herself...

Come out, as [[Gay|otherkin]].

Corinna now quotes herself in biographies, she writes in [[unwarranted self-importance|third person about herself]] that "I believe in faeries, sure as death" believes she is, too!

<youtube>I34OmNO7UnY</youtube>

Ya rly? Is faery gold another word for [[Jew gold]]? You said they were extradited! Also, we know Corinna must be an idiot, because [[Jews]] killed [[Jesus]], and [[Jesus]] saves, and anytime you mention imaginary people being extradited, you are automatically singing without [[Jews]].

[[Image:I hate touching jews.jpg|thumb|LIES.]]

== The Razor Don't Discriminate ==
When all she got in response to her "I believe in faeries" video was asspats, she decided to tackle another topic close to the hearts of her target demo! We can only assume that someone as pathetic as Corinna has a lot of experiences with the subject of self-injury (if not intended then failed attempts), so who better to make a YouTube video about it than her!

She daftly states in the following video that self-injury can happen to anybody and it doesn't discriminate.  Noshit? Noshit!

<youtube>kaZzE9BAvlc</youtube>

She also does not want you to kill yourself, because that would mean she has one less fan.

== Jesus Loves Me ==
Still not satisfied with the amount of imaginary hate mail being sent, she decided that the best way to [[troll]] herself would be to "come out" as a Christian. This would surely upset all the fat nihilistic [[goth]]s that listened to her music. Clearly crushed, she picked up her camcorder to bestow more wisdom upon the few [[fgt]]s that still supported her "art". She decided now would be the time for another whiny ass bullshit video about her baby raping dead Daddy Dearest, and go on about the cross he gave her (why not a pearl necklace?) which she only wears when it's convenient for her or to look cool
All of that is really old news, since Corinna has recently admitted when she goes to bed at night she has [[BDSM]] wet dreams about Christ. [Oh Jeebus, up there restrained on that dart board, make perverted nasty love to me. It's almost like I could do anything to You, including making a mockery of Your followers and bastardizing Your religion. Now can You possibly give me a life so I won't suck as much?]

[[Image:Emochinsee.jpg]]

== Music Videos ==
Corinna has decided that a superstar like herself needs music videos, and so she has taken it upon herself to subject the whole of YouTube to her mannish facial features; her voice that sounds like a [[cat]] being shoved through a wood chipper; her horrible directing; her horrible acting and writing skills, all shoved into five minutes of non-stop torture so painful it would make towel heads with AK-47's proud.  

On the plus side, we get more of that "raped mongoloid child at the moneyshot" expression.

<s><youtube>pIlr3o-8qUY</youtube>

Her fans, proving that people with bad taste in music have bad taste in everything else, have demanded [[moar]]! 

And they have received. <s>[http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=faerie27d]</s> LOL CLOSED

Yes bitch, you are ugly, and we can read your MySpace blog. But don't worry, with a bag over your head, you're still useful.

== Fun Facts ==
* Her songs have death certificates, despite their being illegitimate children from her days of turning tricks in Hell's Kitchen.
* None of this other shit matters, because she still sucks your Dads off for nickels.
* Corinna reads this and then cuts herself in every direction (except [[You are doing it wrong|DOWN THE STREET]]).
* Corinna will never be considered [[An Hero]], (even if she does finally manage to kill herself) because let's face it, no one will care.
*[[Chocolate rain|(**Corinna moves away from the mic to cut herself)]]

== Cat Fight ==
Once upon a time there was a comment filled with dozens of typos and spelling errors left on Corinna's vampirefreaks account. After we brought the whore's attention to it she ran off to baleet it, then she fucked with the copy we had up here. This is because she is a [[cunt]] with no sense of humor, which doesn't really matter because we'll all still laugh AT her.

Fortunately, after much digging, the writer of said comment has provided us with a copy of the comment left on her page. For your enjoyment, it is as follows:  

"i just want to know how someone as fake as you can make such wonderful music? you are on myspace now claiming to be a christian and proud of it, but when "that lady" from your vblog on youtube and i were your biggest supporters there and here, you claimed to be wiccan....we did everything we could for you we sacrificed our sleep, our health, our sanity, our time with our families for you and the thanks we get from you is a kick in the face 

for the record,THAT LADY was the one that built the page and ran it, NOT YOU and by making the statement that you did in the blog you basically accused her of a federal offense....not cool, not the way to treat someone that almost wound up in the hospital because she wanted to see to it that your song plays were up where we wanted them to be, to make the banners for your other pages that you still use, and because we had a difference of opinion and said that we were not going to be your little lapdogs you decided to delete and block us, as well as drag innocent people into the bullshit arguement and have other peoples' pages deleted that had nothing to do with your paranoid bullshit including MY DAUGHTER"S MEMORIAL PAGE....definitely not the "christian" way to treat people you claimed were your friends

You allowed the drama to return to your circle of friends more than once, and if i remember correctly, the person in question was the reason you shut me out as well you stopped talking to me because i didn't delete her from my friends list.....last time i looked we were out of 5th grade. Second of all, are you aware that she has multiple pages JUST so she can keep talking to these people you seem to have a problem with? 

finally, the video i sent to her along with everyone else on my friends list was NOT an anti christian video, it was an anti george bush video 

Now with all that being stated, this is your final warning.....the people you claim to be iguilty of the hatemail are not actually doing any of it, nor do we give a shit about you anymore so stop trying to exploit us like you are with your so called beloved Heath just to get sympathy or to sell a few more records because sooner or later the sleeping masses will start to wake up 

something for you to think about.....when you had myslef and the other 3 or 4 people in your top friends and whatever supporting you, how many song plays did you have a day? where were your song plays at?
and now that you have gotten a bug up your emo whiny attention whoring ass and decided we weren't cool enough for you anymore, where are your song plays at now? what number are you on with the charts there?"

== Corinna Steals Gospel <s>Lyrics</s> Entire Songs ==

Swing low, is right, right for J when you write fucking gospel, songs that suck you t.|left]] For a while Corinna claimed to have written a song called "Swing Low" which she of course wrote for that winter person she bumped into on a bus once and then fell in love again, apparently, and supposedly sang at his funeral, but never sang after, or posted online!  Recently she decided to go ahead and post it, online, and it appears to be nothing more than  lyrics from the song "Swing Low" (well duh).

You better start asking yourself "What will Jesus do when he rises from the dead?" because bitch, I guaran-damn-tee I'll be one of the first people that gets a knock on the door.

== The Disappearance of Corinna Fugate ==

In early 2008, Corinna went MIA. She was usually whoring it up on MySpace - 24/7 including all major holidays, even Christ's birthday for Christ's sake. For a month, Corinna failed to log in. Her fan brats went insane and began posting messages by the hundreds on her MySpace profile, begging Corinna to log in, or just post a blog, just let them know she was okay. Finally in March, Corinna logged in and posted a whiny ass blog entry on her MySpace about her doctor putting her on Prozac and asking everyone to pray for her. Within days, every single MySpace profile she maintained was deleted, leaving her moderately retarded fanbase to flail about behind their keyboards helplessly, their little cult completely dissolved at the click of a button.

Rumors began flying almost immediately after Corinna stopped logging in regularly, and a troll successfully started a rumor that Corinna had finally [[An Hero]]'d by leaving a message telling Corinna to "rest in peace" quite publicly on her MySpace comments. Within hours Corinna's flock of sheep had left a dozen messages pleading with Corinna to not have killed herself (am I the only one who sees how stupid that is?). Rather than respond to the comments and reassure her fans, Corinna, being the complete bitch that she is, simply deleted her accounts, leaving the majority of her fans in the dark.

However the rumors of Corinna's death continue to circulate their way around the interwebs and Corinna continues to completely ignore the desperate cries of her cult's followers.  Luckily (or unluckily) for the rest of us, Corinna baleeted all of her shitty videos off the Internet, but her fans have begun posting videos for her in her absence!  Below are a small sampling of her retarded "friends" defending Corinna.  Who, you might notice, has not even bothered to comment and thank them for being so loyal.  Bitch must be dead.  Is it me, or are all of these people fugly?
== A Family of Drunks ==

Whilst trudging through whatever garbage Google provided in response to our searches for Corinna's relatives, we came across an article about a woman named Jordan B. Fugate living in the Kansas City area, an area Corinna once called home.  Apparently, Jordan Fugate was arrested in March of 2008.  This is just around the time that Corinna stopped logging into her MySpace regularly.  [http://blogs.kansascity.com/crime_scene/2008/03/kc-motorist-acc.html Jordan Fugate struck and killed a pedestrian while driving drunk in November of 2007].  Is it possible that these two freak shows are related to each other?  More than likely.

Stranger still is one comment left on the Kansas City Crime Scene blog:
''
"She kinda favors [[Lindsay Lohan]]. How appropriate!"''

== New MySpace ==

Currently some troll is pretending to be [http://www.myspace.com/corinna_fugates Corinna Fugate on MySpace]... again. When will these fags figure it out?

== Oh great, she's back ==
Sadly she didn't decided to become [[An Hero]] and has actually returned, but wait for it... with a new name and new personality! 
The fuck-tard now goes under the name of "Rose Mercury" which she claims was legally changed, yeah right.

She no-longer cares about God or any of that crap and constantly feels the need to tell everyone (in endless Myspace bulletins, or as she calls them "bulletons") that she's back, which is fucking stupid as all her die hard stalker fans already know this. Oh and it gets worse...

The stupid troll claims she was in England all this time and has picked up a fake British accent that even 5 year olds can spot as fake. Apparently everyone in Britain says "darlings" so she adds it to any message (written or video) as many times as possible. Maybe it's some sort of fucked up competition to see how annoying she can be in a short period of time. 

<youtube>fVb9BOyueWg</youtube>

Now thats funny!

Why oh why Corinna, sorry Rose, didn't you become [[An Hero]] like everyone wanted?

If it isn't bad enough that the bitch is back spreading her crappy music once again, she feels the need to remove her clothes as well! 

http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=443215219&albumID=782490&imageID=4796018

Seriously can she be more fugly?

However, her blind fans continue to stand by her...
Wow...c'mon, open your eyes here people!

'''HOWEVER'''...due to Corinna (and fuck it, let's still call her that) being an overall dumb bitch, not logging on enough for anyone to care and not making any common sense about anything, her fan base has steadily declined. In a statement taken from an anonymous fan who has seen the light...

"It's amazing, I can't believe she would fuck us all over like this. I wasn't the hugest fan of hers like these other ones are making themselves out to be but I liked some of her songs, I felt she was a nice person and she made me feel like I was important even when I felt like dying. I commented her a few times and when I did she always commented me back with positive things. I never saw anything wrong with her. The only time I had a problem with her was when she started getting religious. I went to private school for 7 years so I've seen and heard it all unfortunately. Then she left. She left after I got rid of my myspace so I didn't realize she was gone until a few months before she returend. I was angry that she did. I couldn't contact her through anything! Then she finally came back and I almost burst out laughing. I mean, is she serious!?!? How the hell are people buying into her acting British and claiming that she changed her name?!?! I was so disappointed in her that I tried to post my thoughts on those stupid new music videos of hers but I couldn't. And it can't be me because I've tried so many times. She must've banned me!!! Can you believe that bitch?!?! All that respect and admiration I had for her and worrying that she had killed herself and she bans me from posting my thoughts and feelings for her and her other fans to see!!! Now, I finally realize how I and all of her fans are being toyed with. Fuck you Corinna!"
