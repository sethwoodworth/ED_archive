'''Rachelle Waterman''' is [[LJ]] user {{lj|user=smchyrocky}} who had two ex-lovers murder her mother in Alaska. [[Allegedly]], they locked her in a van and set it on fire. 

==History==
"Just so you know, last night my mother was murdered" started the last entry in her journal. She talked about a pair of new boots she bought, before mentioning her mother's death.

After the incident, Waterman's [[LiveJournal]] received thousands of comments. Many of these posters originated from [[Something Awful]]. For a short time Waterman's LiveJournal still existed with much of it censored until it was finally deleted. Rachelle's LJ is back in service, but only with entries dating May 2007 - Present.

If you are a [[drama whore]], you'll want to download [http://elliottback.com/wp/wp-content/smchyrocky DeadlyBlogging's archive] of her [[LJ]] account. It includes the final entry and many others among which you can find her worldly views on [[Suck|violent people]]. 

Rachelle Waterman's continuing popularity landed her userpic in part of the [[LiveJournal]] "8 million users" mosaic picture.[http://www.ljdrama.org/index.php?p=1166#comments]. Even LJ can't get enough of that wonderfully [[insane]] bitch.

==Indictment Dismissed==
[http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/03/08/teen.freed.ap/index.html CNN] reported that the Juneau Superior Court did not charge Rachelle with any offenses as she ruled that [[police|the pigs]] may have [[rape|coerced]] the [[teenager]] into making incriminating statements. [http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/7518197p-7430195c.html ''Anchorage Daily News'' Rachelle's two ex-lovers were sentenced] to [[No more than 99|99]] years each.

==Take Two==
Rachelle has been indicted again! [http://rachelle-waterman-news.newslib.com/story/2555-3230829/ The trial has been set for September].

==Popular Culture==
Rachelle was immortalized in two songs called "Van On Fire" and "LiveJournal" by [[Loser|popular]] [[Crap|hip-hop]] [[Orgy|group]] [[Futuristic Sex Robotz]]. Thank you Rachelle, for being [[insane]].
