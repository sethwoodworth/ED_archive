Assassination
[[image:10weekold4.jpg|thumb|right|Preemptive assassination of a future [[fuckwit]]]]
Assassination is the ultimate [[pwn]]age of a famous dude, always generating drama and, usually, drawn-out trials that will be shown on [[television]].  It is difficult to assassinate someone on the [[internet]], but that doesn't stop people from saying they'd like to try. If successful, the last you'll see of your opponent is on [[teh]] reruns, kiddo.

 I wish you were dead,
 I wish you were.
 When all I have is you,
 Inside my head,
 You're in my head,
 And it would be much easier if you were dead...

The kinds of people you can assassinate are practically infinite. You have to be subtle though. [[Pop]]ping them with a shotgun will allow the [[lulz]] to run wild, but you'll probably be jailed by the [[FBI]] and end up like [[goatse|this guy]].

Traditionally, [[bitch]]es have assassinated their favorite famous dudes by poisoning them. And it was very effective, until the forensic police bred like rabbits. Now you can't even get away with shooting up a hobo with cyanide.

Lately, the good old trusty firearm has become the weapon of choice. Quick, simple, and can be as painful as you wish it to be, you [[sadist]]ic prick. That is what you want, [[amirite]]?
