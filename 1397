<strike>Contravention of [[freedom of speech]]. In [[internet]] terms, a phrase used to refer to any ████████ or █████████ of any █████ whatsoever in a █████ or █████████. Typically using an unlubricated ██████████████████ without the express █████████ persmission of the Department of ████.

Screaming "Censorship!" is a classic [[Drama-generating technique]] and a perfect way to ██████ a [[moderator]] or an [[admin]] everytime you don't agree with any arbitrary decision taken by him. It doesn't matter how small that █████████ is, because if you're lucky, a bunch of [[retard]]s like [[you]] will suddenly become ███████ and start screaming "Censorship" as well. After effectively igniting the [[█████████|flame]], the admin will have to either lose a lot of time explaining people the reasons for his decision or start banning everyone. Either way, the [[troll]] wins.


Example:
:Prima: '''Announcement:''' I just banned Secunda because she [[█████████|crapflood]]ed my [[█████████|forum]] with [[█████████|kiddy porn]].
:Tertia: "OMG this is CENSORSHIP u r not letting teh TRUTH about 911 come out!!!! [[Godwin's Law|HITLER]]!!!!!!"


The problem is, 99% of Censors (or Forum Regulators or whatnot) look for [[███████|porn]] and [[█████████|smut]]. Think about it, they get paid to look for extreme XXX stuff that is illegal in most countries.<BR>
Don't kid yourselves, the government workers who get to decide what rating a game is going to get aren't normal people. They spend their life █████████ Disney movies to make sure there's no titties for the kids to see.
All in all, Censors are f***ed up in the ███████. They might say you're a sicko for █████████ child porn, but before they ████████ it all, they [[fukken saved|save a copy to their PC]]. It's the truth.

===Example #2===
<TT>
True story, man. I found the secret to a great ██████████████████ is to ██████ a ███████ with large  ███████ -- '''inside''' the bacon -- █████████, ████████ stick the "shuttlecock" in a well lubed waffle-iron. After that ████████████████████████████████████ the Window Aliens ██████ summer concert series kegger █████████ █ shoehorn ███████ Llama.<BR>
Oh, and then Steven Seagal shows up with his █████ in a █████████████████ and we all ███████! Good times, man. Good times. </TT>
