[00:06] <cirrus> Skuee: talk to us plz
[00:06] * ITTwin is now known as ^ban^
[00:06] <PurpleDrank> On June 23, 2007 at the request of Mike Skehan and an entire Stickam room that ganged up on him, Skuee denounced furrism and furry faggotry after three long months of soul searching. Listen closely to the background to hear people in the Stickam room telling him what to say.
[00:06] <emoskank> hugbox is still down, he has no support system
[00:06] <PurpleDrank> Skuee this proves that you did not publicly denounce your furfaggotry of your own chocie
[00:06] <Puetiwaa> shit, Skuee got trolled by Stickam?
[00:06] <Homicide> He's going to make some more drama
[00:06] <BURK> skuee we have hugbox penetrating bombs
[00:06] <PurpleDrank> but merely because your Stickam peers told you to
[00:06] <Homicide> I bet he's making an account to blank that shit
[00:06] <Puetiwaa> that's some failure right the fuck there
[00:07] <mikeskehan> he didn't, u could hear me telling him what to say in the background.
[00:07] <BURK> we can destroy you inside your hugbox
[00:07] <cirrus> i predict cries of "this is illegal"
[00:07] <BURK> cirrus yes
[00:07] <cirrus> that or frantic dox shredding
[00:07] <N3X15> Yeah, I'll be there to revert it
[00:07] <cirrus> DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING OTI
[00:07] <Hoveround> guys
[00:07] <^ban^> N3X15: He lurks moar.
[00:07] <PurpleDrank> This makes me feel that you'll do anything just to feel accepted
[00:07] <Homicide> N3X15: I'm watching it too either way
[00:07] <Hoveround> is it still business hours in US
[00:07] <BURK> of course i saw delete fucking everything coming
[00:07] <Puetiwaa> (23:07:19) <cirrus> i predict cries of "�BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW�" <-- fix'd
[00:07] <Hoveround> someone call gamestop
[00:07] <mikeskehan> also skuee deleted all his fury blogs immediatly after we found them which proves guilt.
[00:07] <PurpleDrank> Which is a pathetic trait in a human being
[00:07] <cirrus> Puetiwaa: correct
[00:07] <BURK> so i backed up 10 of his lulzier vids
[00:07] <Hoveround> and ask if they'd deny employment
[00:07] <Homicide> I should call gamestop
[00:07] <Hoveround> in that scenario
[00:07] <SR> Hoveround: WIN
[00:07] <BURK> skuee: do you love the internet?
[00:07] <Homicide> Hoveround: he's 16 anyway
[00:07] <Anonymaus> ONCE A FUR, ALWAYS A FUR
[00:07] <PurpleDrank> And personally I feel that we shouldn't have to spare you
[00:07] <BURK> skuee: do you love the internet?
[00:07] <Homicide> brb cigarette
[00:08] <Homicide> Skuee: Are you a dickgirl?
[00:08] <BURK> do you know what hate is now?
[00:08] <Puetiwaa> if Gamestop have a 18+ employee policy, he'd get rejected regardless
[00:08] <N3X15> They wouldn't, it would be discriminatory or something.
[00:08] <BURK> becuase this isnt full hate yet
[00:08] <Homicide> Puetiwaa: they do
[00:08] <mikeskehan> skuee: also, plz note i have a screen cap of your flordia state issued ID
[00:08] <BURK> we will call your parents skuee
[00:08] <BURK> your school
[00:08] <Homicide> mikeskehan: upload that shit to ED
[00:08] <cirrus> Puetiwaa: no, it was the naughty ED article that lost him the job! truth!
[00:08] <N3X15> A furry would sue them
[00:08] <PurpleDrank> If you're so weak to criticism that you must change yourself then you should really get off the internet
[00:08] <N3X15> lol
[00:08] <BURK> hell we have plenty of people who live in florida that can even put up flyers at your school
[00:08] <SR> Skuee: you going to make youtube videos about ED looooooool???
[00:08] <Homicide> HOSHIT
[00:08] <Homicide> WHERE IN FLORIDA
[00:08] <Homicide> WHERE IN FLORIDA
[00:08] <Homicide> WHERE IN FLORIDA
[00:08] <N3X15> :O
[00:08] <^ban^> Suddenly, Skuee. Thousands of him.
[00:08] <mikeskehan> homicide: i'm ripping it from my backups now
[00:08] <Puetiwaa> Homicide, then ED had nothing at all to do with the fact that he's underage b&, as far as Gamestop are concerned...
[00:09] <Homicide> Puetiwaa: yep.
[00:09] <Homicide> They didn't google shit
[00:09] <ITSBAWWWWWWWWTIEM> ITS GOOFYTIEM
[00:09] <SR> liezzzzzzz
[00:09] <PurpleDrank> Skuee please talk to us
[00:09] <Homicide> They denied his ass
