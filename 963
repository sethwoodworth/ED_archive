[[Bill Kaulitz|Billa "Bill" Kaulitz]] is the [[trap|female]] lead singer of [[Hitler|German]] shit band "'''Tokio Hotel'''". Recently, she's become a minor internet anti-meme, commonly featured in [[b|/b/]] and elsewhere with posts of her stunning photos and brief mention of her androgynous first name. [[Typical|Typically]], this is followed by [[Admiral Ackbar]] posts intended to trick [[newfags]] into believing that there's [[trap|more to her than meets the eye]]. Bill is the real-life equivalent of [[Bridget]].

"'''Bill Jokes'''" often refer to her neo-emo goth punk rock appearance and her gorgeous-yet-far-out hairstyles.

'''Q:''' ''What would you do for Bill?''<br/>
'''A:''' ''Loan her my [[cutting|razor]] and a noose.''

==Early Years==
Bill initially rose to fame as a quarter-finalist in 2001 Germany's [[preteen pageant|Star Search]] competition, where her likeness was compared to the delicious young [[Natalie Portman]] in Luc Besson's 1994 film "''Leon: The Professional''", which co-starred the juicy Jean Reno and famed character actor Gary Oldman.

Arguably, the only thing keeping her from winning was the unfortunate fact that, at the time, her voice sounded like a bag of [[NEDM|kittens]] being run through a garden tiller.

==Countdown==
Bill, and her identical twin brother [[Tom]], were born on September 1st, 1989.  Despite the fact that they legally been able to consent to [[rape|sex]] for the past 6 years under [[Nazi|German law]], several dozen websites ran 18-year countdown clocks to commemorate their birthdays.

Her band, '''"Tokio Hotel"''', was named after an [[Azn|Asian]] county/town/city/whatever  and the German word for [[penis]]. They've had a string of successful albums and hits over the last few years, including...
*"''Schrei - so laut du kannst''" - "Sex - so long as you can"
*"''Übers Ende der Welt''" -  "[[Tits|Udders]] That I've Felt" 
*"''An Deiner Seite (Ich Bin Da)''" -  "A Dinner Swiss (Boom Ba)"
*"''Durch den Monsun''" - "Fuck The Monsoons"
*"''Jung und Nicht Mehr Jugendfrei''" - "Jews Stole my Testosterone"
*"''Ermöglicht haben alle analsex''" - "Lets all have Analsex"

Unfortunately, everyone forgets the band because of the beauty of frontwoman Bill and because the others are all [[gay]]. Bill's twin occasionally makes an appearance for twincest fics, but generally no one knows who the other two are and quite frankly no one wants to. Anything related to Tokio Hotel often turns into vicious drama instigated by [[16 year old girls|fanfags]] and [[13 year old boys|haters]] due to TH being the most simultaneously loved and hated band in the world. Here is an accurate transcript:

<b>[[fangirl|billkaulitzwife4evax]]:</b> omg, lIKE, i love tokio hoteal its like the most [[punk|gay]] baend ever bill is sooooo dreamy

<b>[[illiterate|maggot666]]:</b> wtf u faggot y dont u listen to [[metal|tru mettl]] lyk [[Slipknot]] and [[communist|System of a Down]] insted of these fudge packrs who r totally being manipualetd by the [[W|corpoatiaons]]

<b>[[illiterate|billkaulitzwife4evax]]:</b> stfu, how can i b a [[faggot]] if im a [[16 year old girl|gurl]]!!

<b>maggot666:</b> fuck u bitch suck my penus i am a real [[13 year old boy|man]] unnlyk these FAGS!

Just remember, no matter how [[trap|manly]] Bill may be, fapping to her still makes you gay. It doesn't matter that you're a straight guy who just noticed how [[gay|manly]] Bill is, you are gay. It doesn't matter if you still like other girls and exclaim over and over that you're [[gay|straight]]. Bill is still there in the back of your mind haunting your [[fag|heterosexuality]].
That includes all you [[No girls on the internet|talking vaginas]] with computers in your kitchens. Everyone is gay for [[My Immortal|Bill]].

==Musical Style==
Arguably, the best categorization of Tokio Hotel’s [[shit|musical style is an eclectic blend of various aspects present in modern day media visuals, such as (but not limited to): livestock mutilation, sub-Saharan dry guitar riffs, and partially recognizable remnants of deceased]] [[Dodrios]]. However, claiming that their genre is near legendary bands such as Metallica (despite their questionable actions (see: [[sellout]])) is not only a disgrace to “classic” rock, but a gross overestimation of this German-based group’s musical abilities. Most of their debated fame can be attributed to two factors: 1) the exponential growth of new generation retarded [[fangirls|teenage girls]], believed to carry a rare strain of [[rabies|acute encephalitis]] , and 2) the belief that the two front members of the band, Bill and Tom Kaulitz, are engaging in [[incest|sexual activities]]. Nevertheless, Tokio Hotel deserves commendation for serving as a diplomatic stronghold and strengthening [[World War II|foreign relations between the United States and Germany]].

===LOVE LIFE===
Apart from banging her twin brother Tom, Bill is currently in a hot and heavy relationship with every last member of another German band, Cinema Bizarre, and, of course, together with her twin brother, in a ménage à trois in their home city of Hamburg with the German rapper Samy Deluxe.

===[[Bullshit|Bill Kaulitz now an Hero]]===

According to CNN, Ms. Kaulitz and her [[goatse]]-loving friend Tom became [[An hero|heroes]] when they both died in a car crash.
/b/ died. Everyone else was [[gay|thrilled]].

==SHOW'S CANCELLED DUE TO AIDS==
In March of 2008, Bill suddenly became very [http://digg.com/comedy/Tokio_Hotel_concert_cancelled_thousands_of_emos_cry ill], and had to [http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/21527420.html cancel] a show in [[Portugal|Portugal]].  This caused  copious amounts of [[butthurt]] from [[emo]] [[16-year-old girl|girls]]. This was actually one of the finest pieces of drama ever, which gathered thousands of people in one place and then had some guy telling everyone to [[GTFO]], resulting in massive amounts of wrist cutting blood. When asked if he did it for the [[lulz]], he said he just had too much [[cock]] down his throat.
