'''Oscar Wilde''' (October 16, 1854 â€“ November 30, 1900) was a successful playwright during Victorian London, as well as being a novelist, poet, short story writer, Freemason, and total [[gay|homo]]. He is most well known for his famous trial, were he was convicted of indecent acts (which were included but not limited to fucking young men; the acts also included going other things to said young men). He is the father of all modern day trolls.

In 1891, Wilde became intimate with Lord Alfred Douglas, and there were some [[lulz]] involving the man's father and vegetables, but eventually all of the bum-rubbery lead Poe straight into two years of hard labor, and not the kind of labor he enjoyed.

A quote from the trial:
[[Image:Nambla.jpg|thumb|It is a little known fact that Poe was the founder of NAMBLA.]]
<blockquote>
Wilde: "The love that dares not speak its name" in this century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan, such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare. It is that deep  spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect. It dictates and pervades great works of art, like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo, and those two letters of mine, such as they are. It is in this century misunderstood, so much misunderstood that it may be described as 'the love that dares not speak its name', and on that account of it I am placed where I am now. It is beautiful, it is fine, it is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about it. It is intellectual, and it repeatedly exists between an older and a younger man, when the older man has intellect, and the younger man has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before him. That it should be so, the world does not understand. The world mocks at it, and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it."

As you can see, Wilde was a total flamer, and probably would have been a [[furry]] had he been born in the right time period.

==Modern-day Poe==
<blockquote>Once upon a midnight dreary, while i pron surfed, weak and weary, over many a strange and spurious site of "hot xxx galore". While i clicked my fav'rite bookmark, suddenly there came a warning, and my heart was filled with mourning, mourning for my dear amour, "'Tis not possible!", i muttered, " give me back my free hardcore!".....quoth the server, 404.
