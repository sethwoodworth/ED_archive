'''Harem''' comedy is quite possibly the single largest [[animu]] genre ever, right next to [[Mechanophilia]].  What makes it popular is that it is the ultimate [[wapanese]] [[nerd]] wishful fantasy:<br>
'''Lots and lots of hot [[16 year old girl|16 year old]] virgin schoolgirls with tits the size of basketballs constantly wanting to fuck the shy introverted [[otaku]]'''.

So yes, from this observation of the genre alone you can see why [[otaku]] are such disgusting delusional [[pedophiles]].  [[Some argue]] that harem keeps a false hope up for these pathetic losers meaning that it is the only thing keeping them from realizing their utter failure of an existence and becoming [[an hero]].

The "comedy" of harem genre animu's are basically a bunch of contrived "[[fail|awkward]]" situations and [[Unfunny|hilarious]] misunderstandings that the male protagonist gets himself into time and time again, such as how he [[I accidentally X|ACCIDENTALLY]] put his hands on one of the girls [[tits]] from falling down, or how he [[I accidentally X|ACCIDENTALLY]] walked in on some girls changing, and how he eventually [[I accidentally X|ACCIDENTALLY]] falls down on a girl and his face just so happens to land in their panty-clad crotch. This leads to the girls screaming "pervert" and [[Love Hina|punching the guy into orbit]]...only to later [[bitch|apologize]] and then return to [[slut|pine]] for him. Unlike normal men from every other part of the world who would get a boner when these kinds of things happen, Jap men apparently get [[wtf|nosebleeds]] instead.

You would think that this stuff would get tiresome after the first few times, but they seem to draw this out as long as it takes to [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|charge a lazor]]. Did you know that the ''[[Love Hina]]'' manga did this same thing throughout '''14''' volumes? This cycle of girls wanting him so badly, and then him screwing it up over and over, makes this genre a gigantic cock-tease. This is why you will find [[over 9,000]] hentai dojinshi's of any given harem anime for those otaku who need to shoot out their sexual frustrations.
