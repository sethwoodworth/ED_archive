Virgin Killer
__NOTOC__

In early December 2008, [[Chris Hansen]] was browsing [[Wikipedia]] and came across the article about the 1976 album "[[Virgin]] [[Killer]]" by German [[Metal (music)|Metal]] band "<s>The</s> [[Scorpion]]s". Noticing the cover shows a delicious [[loli]] in an advanced state of undress, he called the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] and demanded they tell [[Wikipedia]] to have a seat over there. 

The article contained an image considered "[[CP|potentially illegal]]" (The album cover artwork). [[Jimbo Wales]] and his disciples were intensely [[butthurt|buttraped]] and issued a [[lie|statement]] that he "Didn't [[fap]] over the album cover image, well, not more than once anyway".

Hansen has since moved on to rage over [[Led Zeppelin|Houses of the Holy.]] 

==The Great Britain Banning==
The image was filtered through [[Proxy|proxies]] to protect the fine people of Britain from viewing this prime piece of [[Wikipedia]] fap fodder. The result was many IP addresses were funneled into 2 IPs for each of the major [[ISP]]s in all of [[Oxymoron|Great Britain]], resulting in 95% of the UK sharing about 8 IPs. This meant a vandal and a normal editor could not be distinguished from one another, causing Wiki-Anarchy in the U.K.. Ultimately, the [[Wikipedia Jews]] decided to [[banhammer]] the whole European region, causing a [[lollercaust]] of epic proportions to all American Wikifags.
