Nkem Owoh, the [[ytcracker]] of the [[419]] [[spam]] game, composed this scammer anthem as part of the soundtrack for the low-budget [[Africa]]n movie "''The Master''", in which he starred. The movie, much like the song, is about screwing [[white people]] out of their money. It spawned a whole host of [[meme]]s which enjoy great popularity in [[Bantown]], most notably [[mugu]].

As you can see, the music video is pretty upbeat and has a lot of bright and [[gay|faggy]] colors, which is pretty unusual for a song about wire fraud.

==UPDATE==
Nkem Owoh was arrested [[last Thursday]] in [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/02/419_singer_caught/ Amsterdam]. [[Dutch]] officials reportedly informed him that they go chop his freedom. He was later released.

==Lyrics==
<pre>I know suffer no be small
Upon say I get sense
Poverty no good at all, no
Na imma make I join this business

419 it no be thief, it's just a game
Everybody dey play em
if anybody fall [[mugu]],
ha! my brother I go chop em

[chorus]
National Temples -- na me get em
National Stadium -- na me build em
President na my sister brother
You be the mugu, I be the master
Oyinbo man: I go chop your dollar!
I go take your money and disappear!
419 is just a game, you are the loser I am the winner
The refinery -- na me get em,
The contract -- na you I go give em
But you go pay me sum mo money make I bring em
you be the mugu, I be the masterâ€¦
na me be the master ohhhhh!!!!

When Oyinbo play wayo,
dey go say na new style
When country man do him own,
them go dey shout: bring em, kill em, die!

That Oyinbo people greedy, I say them greedy
I don't see them tire
That's why when they fall into my trap o!
I dey show them fire</pre>
