'''[[ED]] is slow''' (not to be confused with [[Special Ed|'Ed is slow']]) is a naturally occurring phenomenon related to the [[fail|inadequacy]] of current [[Internets]] technology vis-a-vis the inability to transmit [[X-box|vast quantities]] of [[lulz]] at high speeds to the masses.

==Usage==
:'''Prima:''' "ED is slow. Is it getting [[DDoS]]'d?"
:'''Secunda:''' "ED is always slow." 

==How does ED go down?==
It is frequently assumed that ED is under a [[DDoS]] attack when these [[The Caturday Nap|are going around]], however it is frequently assumed [[RONG|wrong]], because ED is immune to DDoS attacks and is immune to [[CS3|ping and tracert]].

Other times you get an error like [[Guru Meditation]] or an error like the one below.

<div style="border:1px dotted #4682b4; padding:5px; background-color:#f0f8ff; width:50%; overflow:auto">
Warning: require_once(extensions/youtube.php) [function.require-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/ed/wiki/LocalSettings.php on line 243

Fatal error: require_once() [function.require]: Failed opening required 'extensions/youtube.php' (include_path='/var/www/ed/wiki:/var/www/ed/wiki/includes:/var/www/ed/wiki/languages:.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/[[pear]]') in /var/www/ed/wiki/LocalSettings.php on line 243
</div>

<br/><br/>However, that is not the real cause.  From a purely technical standpoint, when an outage occurs, ED [[Chris-chan|goes down salty]].  Below is a technical diagram.
