==Exploiting the Interwebs==

On the [[interweb]]s an exploit is when someone takes the code of a website, finds how shitty is its, wipes their ass on it, then proceeds to insert much lulz. Exploits are what makes an otherwise boring website fun and exciting! Thousands Exploits happen every year of varied sizes and varied stages of lulz.

That [[chink]] who broke ''[[World of Warcraft]]'''s code to create an actually working item duplicator, making himself thousands of non-interwebs dollars and destroying the game? Exploit! That crazy [[gaiafag]] who made all the bushes fart and the trees orgasm like a whore on coke? Exploit! hat dude who spammed the screen with 50 glitched avatars with giant dog penises in ''[[Second Life]]'' just to piss you off in in your [[IRL|First Life]]? Exploit!...or [[Furfag]] [[Convention]], it's hard to tell. 

Exploits don't just stop in the holes you can punch in the [[shit|wet paper bag]] that [[programmer|devs]] call a website, though! There's more exploitable things on the interweb! Here's a short list of just a few of them:

[[image:Pinkyexploitable.jpg|thumb|left|100 px|[[Exploitable|Oh, Exploitable!]]]]

* [[Pedobear|loli]]s!
* [[exploitable|Awesome pictures]]!
* [[Pedophiles]]!
* [[Furfags]]!
* [[Scientology|$cientologists]]!
* [[Lulzcow]]s!
* ....and [[more]]!

So get your [[fat]], [[lazy]] ass out there and start exploiting today!
