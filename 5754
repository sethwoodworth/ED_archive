'''Nick Khamhou Dethoudom Chaleun[[phone]]''' (aka '''Nicky the Bigot''' aka [http://www.youtube.com/user/kamododragoon kamododragoon] on [[YouTube]]) is a fat, [[hypocritical]], Azn  [[ladyboy]] and prolific [http://nickysworld.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/clique-pet-peeve/ blogger]. This epic [[lolcow]] is a 34-year-old military brat that lives with his parents and attends Southern Connecticut State University where she's studying to be a [[faggot|nurse]]. He's [[Virginbus|never had a real girlfriend except one that he met online who faked her own death]]. If you thought furries were weird, then you haven't met the load-that-should-have-been-swallowed-by-his-worthless-whore-of-a-mother that is Nicky "Diaper" Chaleunphone. 

Nick's hobbies include [http://nickysworld.wordpress.com/2010/03/30/whats-up-with-women-and-leggings-these-days/ women's underwear], [[faggotry|writting]] [[faggotry|poetry]], [[faggotry|nudism]], [[faggotry|hiking]], [[faggotry|camping]], [[bukkake]] and [[fail]]ing at the Internets. By [[BAW|BAAAWWWWing]] about this article and trying to get it [[baleeted|taken down]] he [[fed the trolls]] and saved it from its original destination: getting flushed down [[Special:Log/delete|ED's toilet]].

{{quote|I am also [[irony|a writter]] and i write [[Duke Otterland|poetry books]] in my spare time|Nick Chaleun[[phone]]}}

It appears that Nicky also fancies himself as a YouTube [[troll]] and managed to get himself a page on [[ED]] by [[butthurt|winding up]] his [[YouTube]] nemesis [[Graeme Stephen Tucker]] (who originally shat out this totally un[[EDworthy]] {{tname|crapstub}} [[Shit nobody cares about|on June 18th]] [[2010]]). It is doubtful that their retarded [[Internet sissy fight]] is at all [[lulzy]] or [[dramatic]] enough to be of any interest to [[ED]]'s readers, [[nobody cares|much less warrant an article]], but since Nicky's [[Special:Contributions/Sas_gaz|attempts to have this page removed]] has piqued the interests of [[ED IRC|#wiki]], there may indeed be [[Unrealistic Expectations|lulz and drama in them thar hills]]. 

He has already informed [[sysops|the management]] that this article is a grave threat to the [[SFB|national security]] of these United States of America as his brother is a [[1337]] [[anti-lulz|counter-terrorism]] Ninja in [[Afghanistan]] and is closing in on [[Osama bin Laden]] so giving his address away to [[Talib&]] spies (who lurk ED for intelligence on US troop movements) is tantamount to treason.

So pull up a chair and a bucket of popcorn...sit back and relax and we'll see [[Streisand effect|what happens]].

== Bio ==

[[Dumbass|In his own words]]: "I do have some [[moobs|breast growth]],  a micro [[penis]] and yes I do get [[Period|periods]].  I [[Castration|can’t reproduce and I can’t have kids]], which [[Eproctophilia|stinks]] and that [[Sick Fuck|suits me fine]].  I’m also [[YouTube Deaf Jam|hearing impaired]] on my [[pussy|right ear]]. Which I can only [[Sex|hear]] [[Anal|in my left ear]]"

===On Being Flamed===
''"I’m not scared or [[engrish|shock]] anymore if anyone [[kamododragoon|writes anything bad]] or good about me, because [[done with ED|I’m through with all the shock I’ve seen online]] and [[orly|nothing will ever shock me or faze me ever again]]. It’s [[Bullying|like being bullied]] and it [[lies|doesn’t even bother me anymore]]. It just [[The Burden of Proof|proves]] that [[NORP|society]] has [[Redundant|devolved downward]] and not [[Evolution|evolved]] to the [[Aspergers|next level]]. That’s why [[Asking for it|I will write on my blogs and make videos regardless]] [[faggot|what people say or think about me]] because I learned that [[Lies|It doesn’t matter what people think of me]], because the [[Narcissistic personality disorder|only person that really matters]] more is [[Graeme Stephen Tucker|me and myself]]."'' 

''"I think [[The Man|they]] should [[censorship|set limits to that type of writing]] people write because if [[Faggots|we]] allow [[Truth|that type of writing]], [http://bit.ly/b9Yode what kind lesson are we teaching our kids about what we post online as adults]?"''

===On ACTUALLY WEARING (OMFG) DIAPERS===

Nick has tried to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]] about his diapers but [[google]] search always wins.

<center>{{morphquote|diapers|background-color: tan; width: 80%; height: 200px;|font-weight: bold;
|i've been soo stressed out that sometimes i wish i can go back on to the diapers. '''Yes, i do wear adult diapers''' and it's only out of convenience and when i go out around town. I'm a lazy person when it comes to going to the bathroom. When i am out traveling, i do wear wear diaper's. What i do have to get is a plastic pants to cover up the diapers i wear.|Nick Chaleunphone
|Wow, cool [[blog]]. I have thought about [[Infantilism|going diapered]] [[No life|24/7]] and I [[Will|may try]] it sometime in the fall. [[retard|I like how you kept a details about being diapered 24/7]] and it's giving me [[Hope|hope]] to try it also.|Nick Chaleunphone
|So how is it so far wearing diapers 24/7. I have thought about [[Sick Fuck|going 24/7]] wearing [[diapers]] and by [[Fag|reading your blog]], i gain some insight as to if [[No|it's worth it]] and so far [[Retard|it seems worth it]]. '''I do like wearing diapers 24/7, not having to worry about going to the bathroom or having to find a bathroom when your out traveling or on the go'''. [[A/S/L|So what's your brand that you are using and what do u like about them]]|Nick Chaleunphone
|I gotta question, when you do [[shit|mess your diaper]] do u go right away and change at a bathroom or wait until your home and then change. Let me know how it goes because i'm reading your blog [[Fap|very well]] and i am starting to think '''i should try and go diapered 24/7''' [[Fellatio|just like you]]|Nick Chaleunphone|}}</center>

===Boasting about his [[My Tiny Dick|micropenis]]===

<center>{{morphquote|sex life|background-color: pink; width: 80%; height: 200px;|font-weight: bold;
|I can push my [[penis]] inward up to 1 1/2 inches inside of me. I can push it as far in as I can feel the pubic or hip bones. I literally can finger myself the same way that women do|Nick Chaleunphone
|My [[penis]] size is [[My Tiny Dick|1 inches when soft and when it gets hard, it expands to 3 inches]], about the size of a chap stick or lipstick|Nick Chaleunphone
|I consider my [[penis]] to be an oversized clitoris and that since it’s so small, I barely notice it being their|Nick Chaleunphone
|It feels like I’m finger fucking myself and feels like precum swirling around inside when I push my [[penis]] inward|Nick Chaleunphone|}}</center>

===Nick has [[no friends]]===

Nick has no [[You don't have any friends|real friends]], he has never gone on a date and [[baw|BAAWWWWW]]  all about it.

<center>{{morphquote|no life|background-color: Aqua; width: 80%; height: 200px;|font-weight: bold;|Like any other birthdays, I’ll just assume to be like any other day, nothing more or nothing less because, I don’t have friends to enjoy it with or a girlfriend to enjoy it with.

|I know that my odds of me ever getting a girlfriend are about the same as hitting the powerball or wining the lottery. I know i never dated in middle school and high school and even in college, i never dated.|[https://nickysworld.wordpress.com/2007/05/07/rambling-mind/ ''nick failed at dating'']

===Nick's fake dead girlfriend===

His only "[[lie|girlfriend]]" was online at just [[fail|31 years old]] they were [[Friend#OL_Friends|penpals]] she became his [[girlfriend]] when she [[Died#Hoax_Death.2FFake_Death|faked her own death]] so he would leave her alone!. 
<center>{{morphquote|girlfriend|background-color: Silver; width: 80%; height: 200px;|font-weight: bold;|Ya know, that girl that i was chatting with named Lexy. Well today i got those dreadful email from her close friends. She died last week in a [[Pwnt|car accident]]. It came to me as a blow and a shock.I wasn’t close to her, but as a penpal, i was getting to know her as a friend.|[https://nickysworld.wordpress.com/2007/07/04/sad-times/ ''Nick says they were just friends'']
|Well today, i feel numb and in pain because my girlfriend got cut down by a careless Drunk Driver. It was a shame that i’m never going to meet lexy in person and now that she’s gone, the only thing that i have to remind me of her is the [[camwhore|pictures]] of her and her emails.

|I know i [[BAWW|cried many times over mentioning her Lexy’s name and speaking of Lexy]]. She was my [very first girlfriend and someone who i knew i was so in love with.

|I loved her when she made love to another women and that’s what i loved about her. I loved her when Lexy went down on Shelby and made wild passionate love. That’s why i know I’ll never find another woman like Lexy, who can please me and make wild, passionate love to another woman all at the same time.|[https://nickysworld.wordpress.com/2007/07/06/finding-a-girl-like-lexy/ ''Nick Chaleunphone'']
|I know i like to have a girlfriend who can love me sexually, intimately, physically and emotionally all while she’s with her girlfriend also. It’s hard for me to find girls like that where i live because all the girls where i live are just pass their used date or not my type.

The tragic thing with Lexy was that I was never gona meet with her because, [[Pwnt|she died in a car accident]] with a drunk Driver.

== Nick Fails at Dramatica ==

Nick found out that he had a page on dramatica [[raged]] he tried deleting the page 5 times and each time [[User:MysteryBot]] [[pwned]] him, now all that's left is his memorial page [[User:Sas_gaz]]. After first [[failing]] he tried again with [[User:Mafiaboy]] and [[fail|fhailed]] again. Finally, in a blaze of [[fail|glory]], he tried again as [[User:Latinthugs]]. You know the rest ...

After he fhayled on [[ED]] he then blamed it on [[Graeme Stephen Tucker]] and proceeded to phail harder. His audio is out of sync with the video and he said he would get the [[FBI]] to lock away [[Graeme Stephen Tucker]] for making the article.
