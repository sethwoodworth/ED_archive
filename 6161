'''An EMAIL is fine too. Send the following email message...'''(taken from the Media Coverage page)

Dear Media,

This is a notification of a protest that will be taking place at the Church of Scientology, 3011 N. Lincoln Avenue, beginning Sunday, February 10th at 11 AM. The protest is to raise awareness of the Churches unethical practices and a plea for the revocation of its tax-exempt status. There will be hundreds of participants at the Chicago protest, and thousands of protesters at many locations across the globe.

Please send a news crew to cover this historic event, so that the people of Chicago may be informed of the outrage that this organization has caused.

Sincerely,

* [http://www.transitchicago.com/maps/rail/rail.html CTA train schedule]

It is recommended that you park at a CTA Park and Ride facility and take the train.  The nearest station, Southport, is closed for renovation, so you will need to use either the Paulina Brown Line station or the Belmont Red Line station.  [http://tripsweb.rtachicago.com/ Plan your route].
* [[wikipedia:Brown Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|<span style="color:#996633">'''Brown Line'''</span>]] Park and Ride is available at the Kimball and Kedzie Brown Line stations.  Take the Brown Line train to the Paulina station and head south (addresses go down) on Lincoln Avenue.  The walk is about a half mile. From the south, take it to Wellington and head west (turn left when exiting the station) until you reach the six-way intersection. The walk is about a half mile.
* [[wikipedia:Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|<span style="color:#CC0003">'''Red Line'''</span>]] Park and Ride is available at the Howard Red Line station.  Take the Red Line train and get off at the Belmont station.  Walk about a half mile west (away from the lake) on Belmont Avenue. Turn left at Southport Avenue and walk another quarter mile south to Lincoln Avenue.
* [[wikipedia:Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|<span style="color:#0033FF">'''Blue Line'''</span>]] Park and Ride is available at the Forest Park, Rosemont, Cumberland, and Harlem Blue Line stations.  Take the Blue Line train to the Belmont station and transfer to the #77 Belmont bus heading to Nature Museum.  These buses run every 9 to 10 minutes during the day.  Get off the bus at Southport, turn right and walk about a quarter mile south to Lincoln Avenue. Transfers are also available to the Red Line at Jackson and Brown Line at Clark/Lake.
* [[wikipedia:Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|<span style="color:#663399">'''Purple Line'''</span>]] Park and Ride is available at the Linden Purple Line station. <s>Take the Purple Line train and get off at the Wellington station.  Walk about a half mile west (to the right upon exiting the station) on Wellington Avenue. You'll see the S&G restaurant from the corner if you remain on the same side of Wellington as the station entrance/exit. Note that the last Loop-bound Purple Line train leaves Linden at 9:30 AM and leaves Howard at 9:44 AM, according to the [http://www.transitchicago.com/maps/rail/rail.html CTA schedule].</s> Scratch that, it only runs to Howard on Sundays. Get on the Red Line at Howard and take it to Belmont.
* [[wikipedia:Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|<span style="color:#006600">'''Green Line'''</span>]] Park and Ride is available at the Ashland/63rd and Garfield stations. Take the Green Line to the Loop and get off at any stop between Adams/Wabash and Clark/Lake. Transfer to the Brown Line at any of these stations.
* [[wikipedia:Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|<span style="color:#FF9900">'''Orange Line'''</span>]] Park and Ride is available at the Midway, Pulaski, Kedzie, Western, 35/Archer, and Halsted stations. Take the Orange Line to the Loop and transfer to the Brown Line.
* [[wikipedia:Pink Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|<span style="color:#FF99AA">'''Pink Line'''</span>]] Park and Ride is available at the 54/Cermak station. Take the Pink Line to the Loop and transfer to the Brown Line.
* [[wikipedia:Yellow Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|<span style="color:#FFFF00; background:#000000">'''Yellow Line'''</span>]] You're SOL, guys. Yellow doesn't run on weekends.

== Placard Slogans ==
The rule for signs is to make the message short and in BIG LETTERS.  The message needs to be big enough to be clearly visible from across the street.  If you can make and bring signs, please bring as many as you can make.  There will be plenty of people to share them with.  It's okay to have some placard with longer messages if they're good.  When you make extras, though, make ones with short messages.
* "Religion should be free"
* "Salvation: $370,000"
* "Google Operation Snow White"
* "Scientology would charge you to read this sign"
* "This Banner Slogan removed due to a copyright claim by the Church of Scientology, Int'l"

== Possible Flyers ==
If you are planning to print and bring flyers, please post a link to it here.  If you are coming and have access to a printer, please choose some flyers, print them up, and bring enough to share.  Do not just put flyers you like - put flyers you are BRINGING.
* This pamphlet was written by a 30-year Scientology member who had left.  It's targetted at their newer members to convince them to leave.  This is two pages, so it should be printed double-sided to be effective. [http://www.whyaretheydead.net/mirror/xenu.ca/pickets/flyers/topreclears.pdf]
* [http://partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology/Target_IRL/Posters Partyvan Posters Archive]
* [http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/3145/secondho6.png This flyer] is a great one created on the IRC channel.

== Talking to the Press ==
It's quite possible that the press will approach a random person in the protest and ask questions.  If this happens, you should say that you are protesting against the tax-exempt status of Scientology, and give them one of the following reasons: (add more!)
* Scientology uses copyright laws to keep their texts secret.  They only tell you what they believe in once you've paid them.
* Scientology gives commissions to their celebrities like Tom Cruise.
* Scientology only gained their tax-exempt status because they sued the IRS thousands of times.
* Scientology is classified as a business, not a religion in France, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Russia.
* Obtaining the highest level within Scientology costs $370,000.
* When you sign up for Scientology, they make you sign a document affirming that they're a religion.  They don't sound too convinced of it themselves.
* There is constant pressure to advance in the levels, which means spending more money.  Should you be unable to afford the fees, you can sign what is essentially a "slave contract" for what is essentially the rest of your natural life.(Scientology believes in reincarnation, and have contracts, specifically in SeaOrg and other branches that hold people to service over the course of several lifetimes...though true, it is about as outlandish as the belief in Xenu, and therefore should not be mentioned.)

*Above all else, emphasize that we are not protesting the religion (If they seriously want to believe that batshit insane garbage...well, let them).  We are protesting the Organization (Syndicate, Corporation, whatever other name seems appropriate).  The crimes it has committed, the people it has killed, the lives it has ruined, and most importantly...the questionably obtained tax exemption status with liberties that longstanding, legitimate religions don't have.  '''THIS IS KEY - IF YOU MAKE MEDIA ATTENTION, TARGET THE TAX EXEMPTION STATUS FOR MAXIMUM DAMAGE'''

== Other Locations ==
It has come to our attention that there are several other Scifag centers is the Chicago area.  We would like to find people to scout out each one of these this Sunday (2/3) to find out some information.  We'd like to know when their Sunday service is, when it lets out, and how many people attended.  We'd like to know what the foot and car traffic is in the area.  Any other information you can provide is, of course, welcome.  At this time, we do not have any plans to protest these locations.  Based on scouting reports, however, this may change.

* 66 South Grove Street (Upper), Elgin, IL 60120, 847-289-8111
* 2720 S. River Road, Suite 45, Des Plaines, IL 60018, 847-824-6257
* 305 Morgan Lane, Fox River Grove, IL 60021, 224-622-5980 - THIS LOCATION IS CONFIRMED NOT A TARGET.

''For practical reasons, some people (likely nonanon) may not be able to attend the Feb. 10th event.  If you would still like to assist the cause otherwise, feel free to distribute the literature at the top of this page, as well as other literature found on xenu.net to other Scientology locations near your area, or at the very least your neighborhood.''
