[[Image:Keyboard cat.jpg|thumb|200px|Keyboard [[Kittens|Cat]] does not care about your feelings. But he will make your [[fail]] a [[Lie|win]].]]
'''Keyboard Cat''' is a [[lulz|horrific]] [[meme]] started off on the [[internet]]s' toobs by [[Mr Hands|animal-abuse exerciser]] Charlie Schimdt (no doubt [[Austrian]]), the poor animal shown in the growingly popular YouTube video "''Charlie Schimdt's "cool cat"''" (See above if you haven't already, you dumbass) is known to have been shot with a high dosage of morphine or something equally <s>euphoric</s> terrible before being put in [[naruto|''some kind of horrific torture]] sweatshirt'' and made to play two [[kawaii]] tunes on a small sized keyboard with at least two settings!

As predicted, the cat community of [[/b/]] were in two minds over whether or not the meme should become [[DevianTART|the next big thing]] - some of their less fucked up members protested about the cat's health after complaints were sent in by hilarious [[caturday]] celebrities such as [[Ceiling Cat]], [[Bike Cat]], [[Limecat]], [[Kitler]] and even [[Tubcat]] - from beyond the grave! These [[cats]] still continue their anguish, planning a shock-rescue mission into Charlie Schimdts basement where Keyboard Cat is being held.

The rest of [[/b/]], and indeed most other sites held by [[basement dwellers|hardcore internet users]] thought the cat was ''cute'' and have tried their best to incorporate him/her into their [[zelda|retarded obsession]] with [[fail]]s and [[win]]s. So now, most epic fail internet videos - such as a disabled person falling down an escalator - will be accompanied by [[Keyboard Cat]] "playing them off" with his [[vore|cute]] keyboardy antics! How I love the internets.


== Video Format ==

Videos are usually of some sort of semi-[[lulz]] fail followed by the music, often with a short slow-motion clip of the moment of fail. The title of the video is usually in the format "Play [[cock|Him]]/[[trap|Her]] Off/Out, Keyboard Cat". It's such a simple format to duplicate that there are [[over 9000|over 300]] videos on YouTube now with Keyboard Cat in them. 

For example:

Whereas videos with over 100,000 views used to be noteworthy near the beginning of YouTube, now they're so common they usually get lost in the YouTube oblivion of [[Chocolate Rain]]s and [[Broccoli Dog]]s. However, Keyboard Cat is srs business, and YouTubers elevated the video to [[meme]] status. However, even the power of Keyboard Cat has limits, and many of the videos that were [[unfunny]] before remain unfunny even with the power of Keyboard Cat playing them off.
