Cleveland
[[File:ClevelandSkyline.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Looks can be deceiving... behind those shiny buildings lurks a cesspit of [[EPIC]] [[fail]]...]]

Considered a near mirror-image of fellow Rust Belt cesspit [[Detroit]] but lacking any past redeeming qualities or historic distinctions [[evar]], this glittering jewel of an American metropolis lingers like a stale fart on the shores of the very filthiest ([[no|coincidence?]]) stretch of Lake Erie. A [[shit|beautiful]] city with [[Lie|crime rates lower than any other city]], it is perhaps even comparable to the lovely state of [[New Jersey]]. One wonders what sort of a place could be so utterly despicable that it could even be an embarrassment to fucking [[Ohio]], but any such questions are quickly answered upon even a cursory examination (hell, just drive around it on the turnpike!). However, as entering or even closely approaching this abhorrent wasteland is inadvisable in the extreme, this article will attempt to spare the reader such perils by providing a distillation of relevant information regarding the origins of the [[AIDS|disease]] referred to as Cleveland, its [[fail|symptoms]], known sufferers, and how to interact with said sufferers without contracting this particularly virulent and chronic strain of [[fail]].

==Concise account of extended fail==
[[Image:Cuyahoga_Burning.jpg|thumb|120px|How fucking filthy does a body of water have to be in order to BE ON FUCKING FIRE?!?]]
After omitting all the [[tl;dr]] and [[SNCA]], there’s really not much left to tell. Cleveland’s main [[lol|claim to fame]] for most of its history was its right-in-your-fucking-way location and corresponding role as a [[Airplane|transportation]] [[F40PH|hub]]. At some point they actually made steel there, but sometime [[last Thursday]] America decided it was retarded to pay more for shit made by lazy, whiny union workers when the [[Azns]] were selling fucktons of the same [[shit]] for next to nothing after making it for even closer to nothing (inexhaustible cheap labor [[FTW]]). Unable to find a cottage industry in building laughably shitty professional sports franchises, and realizing there’s not much export value in brown air, three-eyed fish or [[ZOMG|WATER THAT BURNS]], the city proceeded to collapse into the [[Pools closed|unclosed pool]] of [[fail]] and [[AIDS]] that had always been waiting to swallow it anyway. During the 1990s, [[some argue|it was claimed]] that things were finally looking up for the Mistake on the Lake; however, this “revival” was as fleeting and ultimately illusory as Cleveland native Anne Heche’s heterosexuality, and to the surprise of few within and [[noone]] beyond city limits, it was soon time for Cleveland to [[gb2]] the shitter where it was really the most comfortable anyway.

How is it that so much [[win]] can be had depicting so much [[fail]]? Perhaps it's best not to question our good fortune, so [[STFU]] and watch the second fucking video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzgAjjuqZM here] (I have to settle for linking you for now because youtube loves the cock.)


==Inhabitants==
Clevelanders often [[Masturbation|pride themselves]] on their city’s <s>shitloads of brown people</s> ethnic diversity. This might perhaps be excused for the simple reason that there’s FUCKING NOTHING ELSE for Cleveland to be proud of, but then one must ask the obvious question… black person [[Liberals|considers]] <s>having so fucking many brown people</s> ethnic diversity something to be proud of? (It’s especially lulzy when you remember that they use a caricature of an ethnic stereotype as the logo of their baseball team.) But since Cleveland is full of [[Liberals|just]] [[Democrats|the]] black person of people who do, and some of them very well might end up reading this, we may as well pause long enough to point out the various ethnic groups unfortunate enough to call this horrendous little corner of the world home. It is worth mentioning at this point that most of [[shit|the rest of]] [[Ohio]] is populated almost entirely by [[Christian|God-fearing]] [[Aryan|Aryans]] of [[Republican|impeccable]] [[Moralfag|morality]] and [[Incest|virtues]], which makes the ethnic diversity of Cleveland or any of the other islands of [[lol|“civilization”]] amid this sea of [[meth|trees]], [[Rednecks|corn]], and [[frunz]] somewhat relative. 

That aside, [[TOW]] quotes the [[Snca|2000 Census]] describing the ethnic makeup of the [[Shit|city]] as about 51% black person (a gross underestimation), 41% [[White trash|white]] (a gross overestimation), 7% [[Spics|Latino]] and only about 2% [[Gook|azn]] (both of those are serious fucking underestimations too), and the remainder as [[Snca|something else]] (and since we’re already at 101% why the hell not?). Since precisely 73.333 ([[Leeroy_Jenkins|repeating, of course]]) percent of [[statistics]] [[Truth|are made up on the spot]], we’ll just say that [[Redundant|there are a lot of black people in Cleveland]]. [[White]]bread subspecies that have not yet disappeared from this ecosystem include [[Germans|krauts]], [[Guido|dagos]], [[Greece|SPARTANS!]], myriad varieties of [[Communism|Eastern Europeans]], and no shortage of the [[Irish|blacks of Europe]]. The [[spics]] of Cleveland are mostly [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Ricans]], but there are as always plenty of [[Mexico|Mexicans]] to keep restaurant kitchens moving, [[Guatemala Day|Guatemalans]] to keep hotels and offices clean and [[RAGE]] about the Mexicans, and quite a few Dominicans since after all, somebody’s gotta bring in the [[drugs]]. Also, [[Arabs]]. [[OVER 9000|Lots of Arabs]]; [[some argue]] they were special-ordered and shipped in to [[troll]] all the [[Jews]] that live in the southeast suburbs. And no discussion of “diversity” in Cleveland would be complete without mentioning that there is a higher population density of [[faggots]] in nearby Lakewood than in fucking [[San Francisco]] ([[srsly]]).

These numbers are naturally in a [[Timecube|constant state of flux]]. For example, as more and more black persons keep moving out of the city into those southeast suburbs, the heebs are [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|pulling up their Jew-roots]] and hauling their noses and [[Jew gold]] further and further out – they’re practically to fucking Akron by now. Also, [[azns]] are hopping off the boat in Cleveland in hordes that would make a [[Zerg Rush|Zerg]] [[I see what you did there|blush]], and since they’ll pay [[hookers and blow|fucking anything]] for properties they are taking the fuck over [[All your base|a sizable portion]] of the near East Side (see below). But if there’s one constant in the ever-shifting demographics of Cleveland, it’s black person. In fact, [[Some argue|it has been speculated]] that all the other minorities (a somewhat problematic term to use since it’s fucking Cleveland) were brought there by the white man just to keep the nigras from DELETING FUCKING EVERYTHING and claiming the entire county, since [[Truth|spics, azns, and Arabs hate black people even more than they hate Jews]]. Regardless, we have seen just [[Nawlins|what it takes]] to displace blacks from an urban center in which they are the majority, so it is a fairly safe assumption that they won’t be leaving Cleveland any time soon.

==Neighborhoods and suburbs==
[[File:Cle map.jpg|thumb|480px|black persons not to scale]]
In a supreme [[irony]], the various neighborhoods within city limits and the surrounding suburbs are collectively referred to as the “greater Cleveland area”. [[You|Non-Ohioans]] (lucky fuckers) [[Snca|often include the nearby cities of Akron and Youngstown in this designation]], but there is enough fail concentrated within Cuyahoga County itself that adding those shitholes in would constitute a level of overkill that truly defies comprehension. That said, for the reader’s amusement, the following is a brief listing of noteworthy geographic subunits within and orbiting just outside the event horizon of the [[Goatse|black hole]] that is Cleveland:

*Downtown: [[Noone]] lives there. Srsly, would [[you]] want to? Home of whatever government (lulz) and most businesses (lulz) Cleveland has to offer, as well as [[gay|a lively theater district]] and venues that house [[Sarcasm|some of the most talented professional sports franchises on American soil]]. Roads are thoroughly impassable even by Cleveland standards.
*The Flats: [[Yes|Want to get absolutely shit-faced]], pick up [[Randi Harper|a cheap hooker]], and know where to dump the body later and be sure nobody will even look for it there? If so, the Flats are gonna be your kinda scene! In a move worthy of the utmost [[lulz]], the city has tried to reinvent this waterfront shithole as a [[lol|legitimate entertainment district]], but much like the combustible river running through the middle, they’ll never truly clean it up. [[Noone]] lives there either unless you count the [[homeless|drifters and winos]].
*Chinatown: Not its real name, but who fucking cares? Actually there are almost as many [[Vietnam]]ese and Cambodians as actual [[Chinese]] there, [[No|but can YOU tell them apart?]] Not very big, but growing fast as black person and [[White trash|crackas]] left in the vicinity flee the incoming Yellow Peril; this works out well for Cleveland’s [[lolwut|tourism board]] as the area is actually much nicer now than it was under black person [[White trash|management]].
*Little [[Italy]]: Hey-a, [[Weegee]]! One of the few parts of the East Side where Whitey isn’t leaving for lower-ping servers, although most of its [[Guido|inhabitants]] are dark enough that it confuses the nigras, and probably the [[Greeks]] and [[Arabs]] in the area as well. Possibly the highest concentration of quality Italian restaurants in the fucking Midwest outside of [[Chicago]], even if [[Irony|half the kitchen staff is comprised of Mexicans]]. Situated by pricey Case Western Reserve University, where mathlete [[Tony Stark|engineering majors]], medical students, [[Daddy's_money_lesbian|daddy's-money lesbians]], and the [[leftard]] hellspawn of the [[liberal]] [[Douchebag|elite]] who didn’t have [[Rich and beautiful|the right last name]] to get into [[Harvard|Ivy League schools]] go.
*[[Poland|Slavic Village]]: As name suggests, is good place to be finding friends from old country, comrades. Or used to be; once upon a time this south Cleveland neighborhood was absolutely fucking full of Czechs and [[Polish|Poles]] but decided to open its doors to the [[Hepkitten|Croatians]], [[Serbia]]ns, Albanians, and other visually indistinguishable whiteys who had been [[lurk moar|lurking moar]] until that point. But their dreams of a [[Nazi|snow-white utopia]] were absolutely [[pwnt]] when [[W]] [[I_accidentally|accidentally the economy]], [[B&|kickbanning]] long-time residents from their homes, giving the eagerly waiting black person [[Spics|people]] a window of opportunity to move in and pollute the sacred [[Aryan]] purity of the neighborhood, and forcing Niko Belic to embark on [[Grand_Theft_Auto#GTA_IV|a righteous crusade…]] 
*Glenville: black persons.
*East Cleveland: black persons.
*Collinwood, Hough, Kinsman, St. Clair/Superior, Forest Hills: black person Most of the human wasteland within city limits consists of [[Ghetto|neighborhoods]] identified by the streets at their geographical center; e.g. [[Spics|West 25th St.]], black person, black person, and a metric fuck-ton of other numbered streets populated by black persons and [[spics]]…
*Brookpark: Home of the [[Fail|Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport]], what’s left of the [[Fail|Ford engine plant]], and [[OVER 9,000]] [[Win|STRIP CLUBS]][[Oneoneone|!!!oneoneone]]
*Euclid: Once upon a time, this lakeside suburb was a thriving community of [[Europe|European]] immigrants (except the fucking [[Irish]] who [[Fail|never thrive]]), but it has been in decline since [[last Thursday]] and an equal number of wagers have been placed on [[Yes|whether or not]] the black person will completely take over before the current [[Italian|immigrant]] [[Poland|population]] [[HNNNNNNGGGGG|dies off]] from [[Lemonparty|old age]].
*[[Gay|Lakewood]]: It is easy to ascertain from the name of this western suburb that it is near the lake, and that its inhabitants tend to have wood. Both of these are true, as Lakewood is home to a stretch of Lake Erie shoreline and more [[faggots]] than you can [[hurr|shake a stick at]]… if [[Gay|that’s your thing]].
*[[Jews|Cleveland Heights]]: Historically known for its [[Jews|Jewishness]], this southeast suburb is also home to an inordinate number of [[hippies]] and [[leftard]]s. One of its [[Gay|“cultural centers”]] is Coventry, several blocks of shops and bars on either side of a street by the same name; it tries to be [[San Francisco]] and succeeds (and thereby fails) at attracting [[liberals]], [[DeviantART|artfags]], [[Indie|hipsters]], and [[Emo|scenekids]]. As more and more black person move in from neighboring [[Detroit|East Cleveland]] and [[Nawlins|South Euclid]], more and more [[Jews]] move out… [[and nothing of value was lost]].
*[[Israel|Beachwood]]: Where the [[Jews]] are moving to. HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, they’ve always been there. Which isn’t surprising given that this suburb further southeast is known as one of the more [[Rich and beautiful|affluent]] neighborhoods in the “greater” Cleveland area – which is kind of like saying your gross national product is bigger than [[Haiti]]’s. But nothing in life is certain, and as [[Azn|the yellow man]] pushes black person out of downtown and into the suburbs, and the black man pushes [[White trash|the white man]] out of those suburbs into other suburbs, once the [[Jew gold|economic lifeblood]] of Beachwood starts to be drained by the [[Bailout plan|current recession]] and/or polluted by the presence of enough black person, you can bet the Jews will be [[Gypsy|on the move again]]… quite possibly to where you live!
*Shaker Heights: Being one of the richer of the older Cleveland suburbs, Shaker Heights is full of huge old houses built back in the day specifically to be inhabited by Cleveland's [[WASP|high society]].  Those who planned the city kept this in mind, and as a consequence, everything looks the fucking same when you drive through, and you will likely get lost.  This was done to keep out those who [[niggers|didn't belong]].  However, since the Civil Rights movement, [[white guilt|a different affluent segment of society has moved in]], bringing with them a [[buttsecks|desire for understanding]]. After their children get stabbed from going to school with too many black people, they will all likely move into outer ring suburbs, leaving Shaker Heights to become absorbed into the festering hellhole that is quickly absorbing the other inner ring east side suburbs.  They will, however, still vote for [[rape|hope and change]].
*[[White_trash|Parma]]:  Home to [[shit nobody cares about|a couple radio and TV stations]].

==Noteworthy escapees from this hellhole==
*[[Fat|Drew Carey]]
*[[Batshit insane]] [[leftard]] Dennis Kucinich – seeing little green men must have been a welcome diversion from seeing so fucking many [[Niggers|brown ones]] all the fucking time

==Cleveland, /cle/, and “sports”==
[[Image:Cleveland-indians-logo.jpg|thumb|120px|So are they [[offended]] because of the caricature or because they're being associated with Cleveland?]]
By this point in the article, you may have asked several times why this article made it onto [[ED]], whose stated purpose is the documentation of [[Memes|cultural phenomena]] pertaining to the [[Internets]] ([[also, cocks]]). Well, the most relevant intersection of the <s>shitty</s> city of Cleveland and the interbutts would have to be [[/sp/]], [[4chan]]’s sports board. This is because out of all the mountainous shitloads of [[fail]] ever to come out of the Mistake on the Lake, perhaps the lulziest examples of all are from the world of [[sports]]. This stems from the simple fact that Cleveland is home to not one, not two, but three of the most notoriously bad teams in professional sports. Perhaps the greatest concentration of fail can currently be found in the Cleveland Browns ([[moar]] liek Cleveland Clowns [[amirite]]?) of padball, although the Cleveland [[Racism|Indians]] of steroidball (who have provided plenty of [[lulz]] already thanks to all the [[butthurt]] surrounding their choice of team name) are a close second. The <s>LeBrons</s> Cleveland Cavaliers actually have a decent amount of talent but still manage to fail, a common and [[RAGE|raeg]]-inducing trait of Cleveland teams.

{{quote|'''Here's Michael at the foul line, the shot on Ehlo...good! The Bulls win! They win! They beat the Cleveland Cavaliers! Michael Jordan hits at the foul line! 101-100! 20,273 in stunned silence here in the Coliseum.'''|Even black person loves to [[troll]] Cleveland!}}

Like [[Chicago|many blind devotees of fail sports teams]], Clevelanders tend to overlook seemingly endless droughts and countless losing seasons, preferring to derive most of their [[angst]] and [[butthurt]] from particularly notorious moments (see also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drive "The Drive"], the 1995 World Series, [[Rax Grissman|"Red Right 88"]], the 1997 World Series, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fumble "The Fumble"], [[Bukkake|"The Shot"]][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shot], the [[Boston|2007 American League Championship]]) when their team [[RAGE|SHOULD HAVE WON]] but instead lost [[the game]] due to either abject failure at an inopportune time or simply being [[pwnt|defeated]] by a superior opponent. This provides numerous opportunities for trolling not only [[Fat|hardcore sports fans]] but Clevelanders in general, and as this article later states, there are few other reliable ways to troll them [[OTI]] or [[IRL]], so make these count.

{{quote|'''And wasn't it ironic that Denver got the ball back on the 2-yard-line? Wasn't it just 1 year ago where the Broncos were on their own 2 before putting together what became 'The Drive'?'''|But not as much as [[old media]]!}}

Two factors compound the [[lulz]] to be found in the shittiness of Cleveland sports franchises. One is the nostalgia factor – no matter how horrendous these teams may be now, once upon a time [[ORLY|they really were good]] – no, [[srsly]]! A similar and similarly lulzy point sure to come up in proximity to /cle/ posts is the fact that Cleveland has actually produced a number of good athletes – among them Olympic black person Jesse Owens, old-school handegg black person Jim Brown, more recent handegg black person Troy Smith and of course ubiquitous niggerball star [[DOUBLE NIGGER|LeBron James]] – but has failed to convert this into an acceptable number of championships in any of the sports for which they have professional teams. In fact, most of [[THE BEST]] athletes to come from Cleveland only achieve true graetness ‘’after they leave’’, (LeBron will be next) which leads us to the inevitable conclusion that the city itself must be to blame. Case in point: longtime Browns coach Bill Belichick suffered through losing season after losing season in Cleveland, but not long after leaving proceeded to pwn the world of padball with the [[Boston|New England Patriots]] – at least until that little [[18-1]] incident, lulz. 

A surefire way to induce [[RAGE|raeg]] and [[BAWWW]]ing on [[/sp/]], be it from /cle/ or from [[Yankees]] fans (certainly both hated and trollable groups) is to point out that Yankee$ owner Jew grew up in Cleveland and suggest that the fortunes of the Yankees and the Indians [[Truth|might have been completely different]] had he ended up in possession of the Cleveland franchise rather than the New York one (which almost happened in the early 70s). Go on, [[DO IT FAGGOT|try it!]] Additional tactics for inducing butthurt in Cleveland sports fans include but are not limited to mentioning [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Cent_Beer_Night 10-Cent Beer Night], asking if they would have [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Rocky_Colavito traded Rocky Colavito], asking when the Cavaliers [[never|last won an NBA championship]], and of course invoking the age-old rivalry with [[Pittsburgh]]. Additionally, since you're dealing with people from [[Ohio]] who have nothing else to live for, you'll probably get a lot of [[RAGE|mileage]] out of the Ohio State/Michigan college handegg rivalry too!




==Moar Cleveland fail==
*Cleveland is fucking filthy (Just like the nearby city of [[Youngstown]]). While logic would imply that this is a natural byproduct of the presence of so many black persons, this alone cannot account for the ability of the city’s bodies of water to sustain combustion. [[Al Gore]] would be [[Gay|more than happy]] to tell you that the deplorable condition of Cleveland’s air and water is due to ungodly [[Cum|emissions]] from the city’s numerous [[Cocks|smokestacks]]; however, [[Snca|no one gives a shit]]. The point is, if we wanted to live in a place full of [[niggers]] with filthy water, we would move to [[Haiti]].
*Despite shamelessly pimping itself as the “birthplace of rock-and-roll” and [[trying too hard|building a museum]] to prove it, Cleveland fails hard at having any sort of [[music]] scene unless you care to include a catalog of black person [[Rap|vocalizations]] that would make Jane Goodall [[Orgasm|cream her pants]]. [[Some argue]] that this is because talented musicians there have historically [[Lolwut|gravitated toward Detroit]] or [[Chicago]], but this is hardly a valid excuse as given half the chance, [[You|any sensible human being]] remaining in Cleveland would [[GTFO]] faster than a black person leaving the studio before [[Maury]] can read off the results of the paternity test. While there have been numerous talented artists ‘’from’’ Cleveland, few if any willingly ‘’identify’’ themselves with it, which is why [[Truth|it cannot claim a true music scene of its own the way other cities can]].
*For a city touting itself as a transportation hub, Cleveland’s transportation infrastructure is complete shit. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] built roads [[At least 100 years ago|2,000 years ago]] that are still in use today, but the average lifespan of a pavement surface in Cleveland seems to be [[Fail|about six weeks]], after which time it will either take on the topography of the lunar surface or [[Italian|union]] [[Spics|road]] black person will [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]], then take their sweet fucking time repaving it. There are three orange barrels for every citizen in Cleveland (admittedly this is a ballpark figure as the drifters and winos tend to skew the numbers) – the [[Ohio]] Department of Transportation is highly successful at trolling and quite possibly the only successful anything in the state. Except of course when it comes to doing its [[ALL_CAPS|ACTUAL FUCKING JOB]] of keeping roads passable.
*Cleveland weather is [[shit]]. There are exactly three weather conditions that can occur: COLD AS FUCK and shitting down snow a foot at a time, 95 degrees with 95% humidity and absolutely no breeze, or 40 degrees with 40mph winds blowing rain in your fucking face. Because [[God]] apparently enjoys trolling Cleveland, any two of these can take place within an hour of each other in any order and adhering to no perceptible pattern. Did you grab your umbrella on the way out? Well guess what, bitch, it’s snowing now! Did you grab a jacket and put on a sweater to ward off the chill? Surprise, fuckstick – it’s hotter out than [[Nancy Pelosi]]’s cunt when passing a spending increase! (Bonus points for making you read that and unconsciously think of [[DO NOT WANT|Nancy Pelosi’s cunt]]. Twice, now!)
*Seriously, there is so much fucking [[fail]] in Cleveland that this list [[Too lazy|isn’t even scratching the surface]].

==How To Troll a Clevelander==
Sadly, there is little point to attempting to [[troll]] a resident of this [[Shit|fine]] city. One would think, given Cleveland’s very synonymy with [[fail]], that trolling possibilities would be endless, and the content of this article implies that there is no shortage of ammunition. However, an important thing to remember is that Clevelanders are not only Clevelanders but also [[Ohio|Ohioans]], thus the overwhelming majority of them are in fact [[Retarded|subhuman tards]] and most of your [[Trying too hard|attempts at wit]] will sail over their heads by a [[Shay]]-sized margin. Besides, Clevelanders are so accustomed to and desensitized to their city’s many failings that most will simply laugh off any attempts to mock said failings further. In fact [[Fact|most mocking of Cleveland is done by Clevelanders or former Clevelanders anyway]].

If you mock Cleveland’s [[Toledo|horrendous infrastructure]] or [[Canadia#Hamilton|post-apocalyptic levels of pollution]], you are treading on [[Windsor|familiar ground]] [[Detroit|not worth fighting over]]. If you mock Cleveland’s many political and social failures, then you are trolling [[liberals]] and will only get satisfactory results from the most [[Fat|contentious]] and [[Retarded|insecure]] of [[leftards]]. If you make anything but a casual observation regarding the city’s black person, said leftards will pale in comparison to the wrath of [[offended]] minorities, but [[you]] won’t be saying anything that couldn’t be said of [[Detroit]] or [[Pittsburgh]] or Gary or any other Rust Belt city. (Moreover, this approach is not advisable [[IRL]] since if you are reading and enjoying this portion of the article, [[you]] are most likely a weak, pansy-boy [[basement dweller]] and would not survive long in a physical confrontation with [[butthurt]] black persons.) 

But the moment you introduce sports into the equation, you have attacked the very [[lol|heart and soul of all that is Cleveland]] and can expect enough [[BAWWW]]ing to satisfy any but the most ravenous of trolls. Be sure to mention any of the incidents in the sports section above. Tell them you’re from [[Pittsburgh]]. Ask if LeBron’s been traded yet. Or remind them that the Browns can’t even beat the fucking Bengals. For bonus points, tell them what a smart business decision Art Modell made when he moved the Browns to [[Baltimore]], preferably while wearing Ravens attire in their presence. Be prepared for [[epic]] [[RAGE|RAEG]] if you go this route. 

{{quote|To tell the truth, I’m not excited to go to Cleveland, but we have to... If I ever saw myself saying I’m excited going to Cleveland, I’d punch myself in the face, because I’m lying.|outfielder [[Japan|Ichiro Suzuki]] speaks the [[truth]].}}

In closing, when attempting to extract [[lulz]] from anyone unfortunate enough to be from this most embarrassing city in one of the most embarrassing states in the Union, politically-charged trolling will meet with mixed success. Veteran [[goons]] and [[Btards|/b/tards]] [[OTI]] will get [[Massive damage|definite results]] going the [[racism]] route. But pointing out the immense quantities of sports fail present in the Mistake on the Lake will trigger unique and orgasmically satisfying lulz… perhaps the only thing for which you will ever thank the city of Cleveland.
