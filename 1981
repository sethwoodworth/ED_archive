'''DTV Forum''' is an [[Australia|Australian]] [[internets]] [[forum]] for digital TV and AV which is run by [[nerds]] obsessed with their [[e-penis]] and is a magnet for [[trolls]], [[spam]] and [[fucktard]] [[noob|n00bs]], which can make it a good source of [[lulz]]. 

==The Forum==

[[Image:DTV Forum spam.JPG|thumb|Typical DTV Forum post.]]

DTV Forum only has 2 mods for 30,000+ users. This makes it an easy place to troll and spam because it takes [[at least 100 years]] for the posts to be deleted since the mods are never online.

Every new member must have 5 posts before they are able to start a thread. This is a lame attempt to stop spam instead of appointing more mods which has failed miserably. New members are encouraged to use [http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=48368 The red text thread] and the [http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=45556 Secondary Red Text thread] to bump their post count to 5. However, some [[fucktarded|fucktard]] [[n00bs]] don't post in the red text threads and post rubbish in current threads to bump up their post count.

==Lulz==
