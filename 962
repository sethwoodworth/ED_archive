'''Bill Joy''' is a nice enough guy, but he's always doing something that pisses people off.  Because of him, millions of people have died in relentless religious wars.  He also founded one of the whiniest companies [[EVAR]]: [[Sun Microsystems]]  [http://www.greygoo.org/ for th3 sole purpose of destroying carbon-based life on earth] 

Bill is (un)known for rewriting the TCP/IP stack to make it functional, and for having Microsoft and Apple [[copypasta|copypaste]] his code into their operating systems.  Bill Joy wrote [[BSD]] while on the crapper one day -- and then he gave all the code to UC Berkeley.  Because of him, everyone thought they could go out and build their own [[*nix]], and as a result, most of the [[internets]] is being run by people who belong to some sort of [[server]] cult.

He also wrote '''csh''', and ever since then, BSD users are always whining that engineers are ignoring their shells.  And of course, they'll never give up csh, because it's tradition, damn it!

[[Vi]] is also his baby. Now [[Linux]] user groups are [http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=01/12/04/0326236 destroying themselves] over whether vi is better than [[emacs]].

It was once argued that [[Java]] wouldn't be the object of endless geek bickering because Bill Joy only ''partially'' created that.  However, after a delay for a few years, there is now a Java vs. [[.Net]] vs [[Mono]] holy war.  [[GNOME]] is close to being ravaged because Havoc Pennington insists on using Java.

Thus, the rule of them is that the intensity of [[geek]] zealotry is measured by how much Bill Joy has contributed to the project.

In 2000, Bill Joy produced [[lulz]] when he told Wired that humans would one day be replaced by [[robot]]s.
