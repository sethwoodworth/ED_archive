'''Peyote''' is a [[Cactuar|cactus]] loaded with mescaline, aka shit that will make you trip balls for 5 days. [[Indians]] worship this cactus and engage in ancient rituals where they drink peyote tea while dancing around a campfire and shaking their dicks to please the rain gods. It's completely illegal in the [[USA]] unless you're a licensed, card-carrying member of the Indian church, but you can find the peyote cactus growing wild if you ever pay a visit to [[Arizona]], [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], etc. Should you encounter this cactus, rip the buttons out of the ground, boil them in some water or just eat them if you're lazy, and try not to [[puke|vomit]]. Seriously, this shit tastes like [[shit|death]].  One of the less known cool facts is its' ability to be mistaken with other similar cacti, and if you pick one of the more "special" types, it will likely kill you.

'''[[PROTIP]]''': San Pedro cacti also contain mescaline (in much lower amounts) and is totally legal and available online. There are also ways to extract the mescaline from this if you're such a pussy and you can't stomach the wondefully yucky tea pulp.

'''[[PROTIP]]''': [[Hallucinogens]] are really cool and you should totally experiment with them.
