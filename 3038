Forum
''For the [[ED forums]] go [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com here].''

A '''forum''' is a [[Shit|shitty]] place on the [[Internets]] where [[you|retards]] like to argue, whine, bitch, [[troll|troll]] and moan about [[shit nobody cares about|unimportant and uninteresting topics]].

==History==
Back when the [[old media]] still reigned and the Internets were owned by [[AOL]], [[basement-dweller]]s would hang out on a version of the [[web]] known as [[BBS]]. BBS was quick to evolve into [[newsgroup]]s, which begat '''forums''', which begat *[[chans]], which now herald the end of humanity as we know it.

==Every known forum thread in the Universe==
*[[Fuck you|FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU Microsoft!]]
*Where do babies come from?
*I don't know where the hole is at can you help!!
*Blue Vs. Red or Xbox vs. PS3
*[[Obama]]!!!!!!!!!!
*[[Rape|Teenshawtsex[DOT]COM]]
*Why am I still alive?
*Why can't I become an [[wiiro]]
*My stuff is better than yours [[baby|Faggot]]
*[[NERD RAGE|Windows Vs. Macintosh]]
*[[Fail]]
*[[Amirite|Am I retarded?]]
*[[Fanboy|Which game do you think has b3tt3r Ghapix??]]
*[[Truth|Jews Did WTC!]]
*[[WIN|Spam Topic]]
*[[Lollercoaster]]
*[[Attention Whore|Anal Pics inside hurry be4 the mods come close!]]

==Having a Forum Instead of Real Content==
Some web sites exist exclusively as forums. *[[Chans]], for instance, are forums where the only thing one can do is upload pictures of [[loli]], [[shota]], or [[tubgirl|THE PIC]]. Other places, like [[Something Awful]] or [[Fark]], have no redeeming value other than their forums. In all cases, forums are where [[lulz]] are harvested for [[socialism|the good of the many]] in the form of [[troll]]s and [[internet tough guy]]s. [[IMDB]] and its [[IMDb message boards|forums]] are notable in that the former does have valuable content, but the latter counters that content with its ability to actually force you to put a [[gun]] in your mouth and pull the trigger.

==Full of Win==
[[Image:I_like_where_this_thread_is_going.jpg|right|350px]]

Occasionally forums are taken too seriously, which often results in [[epic thread]]s. When this occurs [[moderator|mods]] often [[baleet]] the thread and pretend the epicness never happened, therefore you should always archive potential epic threads [[for great justice]] and [[copypasta]] to [[ED]].

==[[V&]] > [[B&]]==
Forums do not meet their true potential until someone ends up [[banned]] or [[FBI|vanned]].  In these special cases, it is the duty of the [[EDiot|agents of the lulz]] to duplicate and post everything that led to the smiting.
