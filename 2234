'''Dialup''' was a popular way of connecting to the [[internets]] [[at least 100 years ago]]. It changed the lives of [[13-year-old boy]]s and [[16-year-old girl]]s everywhere because it meant they could access virtually all the [[porn|knowledge]] in the world in the comfort of their basement.

== Dialup & Entertainment == 
Access to dialup meant you could;
*Download ASCII [[porn]].
*Chat with strangers and become [[14/f/cali]] without the expensive surgical procedures and moving costs.
*Download some more porn, provided it was under 4kb otherwise it would take all day.
*Create a homepage on [[Geoshities|geocities]] about you and your [[shit nobody cares about|interests]]. Complete with a [[e-fame|visit counter]]; dark blue on black text; a guestbook; and a "best viewed with IE" label, as if you had any fucking idea about the differences between web viewers.
*Look at porn slooooooowly load.
*<s>Upload porn</s>Download speeds were rated at 56kbps, but actual transfer rates were in the single digits. Dial up was worse than cable coaxial cable when it came to the ratio of speeds on receive channel versus return channels. So, uploading was like downloading, only shittier.
*Ruin your parents credit score by subsequently running up their AT&T bill and crippling their ability to pay the mortgage. Good, job, faggot. [[You]] are responsible for the credit crunch.

== Why it Failed ==
Dialup was as [[Unfunny|slow as Stephen Hawking running the 440.]] Dialup modems made an odd screeching and beeping sound which could be turned down in volume to almost 0. An attempted dialing of the modem to connect to Busty Asians takes most of your day, just to have that connection interrupted by a phone call from [[your mom|their mom]]. It is rumored that prolonged exposure to said noises drove people to [[encyclopedia dramatica|commit suicide]].

== 56k and the Now ==
[[Now]]adays, the only people that still use dialup are [[AOL]]ers, [[old people]], [[Maine|Mainers]], [[African Americans]], [[User:WKD|WKD]] and [[You|You]]. Should you encounter a dialup user online, make sure to link them [[GIF|here]].
