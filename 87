'''Nigerian scam e-mails''', [[Shit nobody cares about|also called "419 scam]]" e-mails, after the Nigerian [[penis|penal]] code reference, are the [[tl;dr]] messages you receive now and then, written in broken but formal English, telling some bizarre story about being the son of the late dictator, needing your help to [[I go chop your dollar|get some millions of dollars]], of which you can have a big chunk, written by some [[Mandingo]] in Nigeria, which is a shithole in [[Africa]] full of [[oil]] and black persons. 

The scam is centuries old, and before the jigaboos and spearchuckers of Nigeria decided to use the internet for cheating whitey on a massive scale, it was known as the "Spanish Prisoner" con.  The dupe would be told that a wealthy nobleman was being held captive in some despot's tower or dungeon.  He would then be told that if he paid the nobleman's ransom, he would be rewarded several times over once the prisoner returned to his lands.  Of course, none of it would be true.  A variant on this con known to be practiced by unscrupulous magistrates and judges setting bail involves setting a cash bail verbally to the defendant, but marking "ROR" or "released on recognizance" on the bailment form.  The judge then pockets the cash.

There are many variations of the story, all of them preposterous. As [[Chris Hansen]] has shown, you will never get your millions, but instead will end up sending the African thousands of dollars to pay various fees that keep "unexpectedly" arising, while he is trying so hard to make all the arrangements for your mutual benefit. It never [[fail]]s, and the [[Niggers|Africans]] make a killing, year after year, from the world's [[:Image:IQ chart.jpg|<s>borderline</s>-retarded masses]]. 

The letter-writers are not always from Nigeria; indeed, the message could come from any place in the [[Niggers|Dark Continent]], and there are even messages from China. Some of the messages take a completely different approach, giving a sob story of being a poor orphan girl, or some other [[shit|nonsense]]. Many of these emails are loaded with some of the best [[Photoshop]] in all of [[Africa]].

===Variant===
This is now so [[old meme]] that those crazy [[Nigra|Nigerians]] are huffing the [[Jenk]] and coming up with new ways to [[troll]] Whitey for his [[Jew Gold]]. The latest is the 
[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/weblog/permalink/nigerian_bulldog_scam/ Nigerian Bulldog Scam] in which that scammer claims he can no longer care for his pure-bred English Bulldog. For a mere $500 the [[vic]] can rescue the poor mutt from [[pwnt|euthanasia]].

He is giving the pup up for adoption because he cant take good care of the pup due to his busy and tight state of work. All he wants is someone that's [[homely]] and with a good christian home to adopt this young and lovely human best friend.|Ian}}

Dear Friend,

You may not know me, however I have happily found you via the means of the
internet. My name is [[Will Smith|William C. Smith]], I am 17 years of age and I am
calling for your help quite desperately. But please, let me tell you
quickly about how my life got flipped and turned upside down, putting me
in the desperate situation you find me in today.

I was born and raised in the suburbs of West Philadelphia, USA. I spent a
lot of my time on my school playground, generally chilling and acting all
cool. I also loved to play basketball outside of the school. However one
day, whilst doing this, a couple of guys who were up to no good started causing
trouble near my house. I got into a large fight, which scared my
mother greatly. Because of this, she suggested I move to the quiet town of
Bel-Air in California to live with my auntie and uncle. The taxi ride
there was long, however the licence plate and comedy dice in it kept me
entertained. Upon my arrival, I thanked the taxi driver and settled in
with my new family.

4 years have passed since that day, and all has been fine until now. My
Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv have recently seperated due to Aunt Viv being
unfaithful with Geoffrey the butler. My cousin [[Carlton]] has entered the
world of narcotic drugs, and the family has collapsed. My mother died last
year due to a vitamin C overdose, leaving me genuinely homeless and
without family.

However, my mother left behind a large sum of money (Approximately
$650,000USD) which is currently in the hands of the family lawyer. I can
only access this money by paying the $3500 access fees as I am under the
age of 18. If you were to help me raise these access fees, I would be
happy to compensate you with $150,000USD of the money I have been left.

Please, if you can help me out financially then I would be grateful beyond
recognition. All I need from you are the following:

Full name:
Address:
Marital status:
Tel/Fax number:

Once I have these I can then put you in contact with our family barrister,
Barrister Jazzy Jeff. He will see you through any legal proceedings that we
may need to withdraw the funds, and also confirm to you what needs to be
done. He is trustworthy man of God and a good friend of mine.

Thanks, and may God bless you.
William C Smith

If you don't have the patience to play the long-term trolling game below, there are ways to have instant satisfaction, though you may never personally see the results. Simply respond to the message saying something like this:

<blockquote>
I am very interested in helping you.<br> Please contact me through the web site I keep to manage my financial affairs:<BR>
[[Last Measure|http://finances.on.nimp.org]]
<br>
I hope to hear from you soon.
<br>
Best regards.

The pleasure may be small and fleeting, to imagine the African in some crowded, filthy internet cafe playing his little scams, and clicking that link, but it is better than no pleasure.

==[[Troll|Pwning 419]]==
While Nigerian scam e-mails usually makes up <s>only a small percentage</s> (a large percentage that you can never hit the "spam" button hard enough to remove) of your daily [[spam]], it is fun sometimes to think of ways to fuck these people over. There are several trolling organizations that work full time on such activities. They enjoy playing along with the African; getting him to send them money (even $20 is a lot to these scammers), a picture of himself looking retarded, getting some horrible tattoo, holding up a silly sign, or some other [[epic]] [[win]]. A gallery of these victims is below. This sort of trolling takes a lot of patience and can be rather [[tl;dr|boring]], but when it succeeds, it is [[Win|great]].

Due to the obviously precarious nature of financial transactions across the internet, and the fact that the fucking King of Nigeria carries out his royal duties through ever so slightly suspect address "hotniggerlad148@yahoo.com", it is not uncommon for victims (scambaiters) to ask for photographic verification for security. Normally these take the form of the scammer holding up a dated sign with a code word, much like camwhores do with sharpies on their tits, cocks and prolapsed anuses. The scammers of course are one step ahead of the game, and, not wishing to divulge their true identities, create masterful forgeries using [[mspaint|state of the art]] third world technology.
