'''Mario "Malevo" Ferreyra''' was [[an]] torture chamber operator, [[an]] human rights violator and [[an hero]] to us all who soaked a television crew in his sweet lulzy blood. 

==Spreading the Lulz==
On the 21st of November, [[2008]] Malevo woke up with [[lulz]] on his mind. But the lulz didn't stay in place for long after using a handgun to shower them around the world. When the police arrived at Malevo's home to arrest him for human rights violations, afraid of receiving a life time of the ass-tearing butt-rapes he'd given in the past, he decided to lulz himself out of his misery.

The usually liberal Argentinian censorship board then threw a shit fit, banning all showing of the suicide footage across the nation's screens. [[You]] view it [http://uk.truveo.com/SUICIDIO-DEL-MALEVO-FERREIRA-SUICIDE-OF-MALEVO/id/250831317 here] [http://uk.truveo.com/Malevo-Ferreyra-Commits-Suicide-In-Front-Of-TV/id/3125754629 here], and [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7392712357317532395# HERE] (Third link is without the advertising bullshit). This caused much lulz on the internets who [[fap]] at the thought of blood and an heroism. It just goes to show, with enough creativity you can still torture people when you're dead.
