'''Powerful Women International''' '''(PWI)''', is a [[criminal]] organization that causes any [[man]] worth his [[testicles|manhood]] to wonder, ''"Who let these [[whores|apeshit bitches]] out of the [[kitchen]]?"'' '''PWI''' is dedicated to [[Asking for it|flaunting]] the empowerment of already inordinately weak women, thus trolling men everywhere, spreading the [[internet disease|cancer that is killing our traditional family values]]: the [[feminism]], the [[homosexuality]] and of course the  idea of a [[Anti-lulz]] world:

{{quote|[[drugs|OUR VISION]] is women [[internets|networking globally]], [[kitchen|empowered and enhancing their lives]], their families and their communities, making the world a peaceful, harmonious, creative, and economically sound place to live for all.|PWI [[bullshit]]}}

PWI believes in:

*[[Women|Wimmins]] are people, and have rights.
*There are [[Trap|girls on the internets]].
*[[Fag|Men are asking for it]].
*<s>[[Some argue]] that</s> the trolling possibilities against this [[4kids|evil organization]] are infinite.
*[[Communism]]
