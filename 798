As we all learned in a [[school]], there are several sorts of bacteria, and not all of them as the same as each other. Some are caught from [[semen]] and the rest are caught from feelthy humans.

==''E coli''==

This bacterium is found in sandwiches and [[Scotland]]. Its first name  begins with the letter "[[drugs|E]]" and it looks shifty down a microscope.

==''Bacterium Toiletseat-icans''==

This bacterium is caught by ladies from [[Toilet Seat|toilets which have had the seat left up by gentlemen]]. It is probably fatal.

==''Bacterium Dosmestos-icum''==

This bacterium is the 1% percent of household germs that household cleaning bleach ''Domestos'' cannot kill. It's a bit like [[AIDS]], but smaller, and it preys on [[OCD]].

==Giant Bacteria==

In the [[Doctor Who]] episode ''Raiders Of The Lost Ark ... IN [[space|SPACE]]''! the large green things the size of a [[dog|Golden Retriever]] seen during the show were actually Macrobacter [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_virus_(computing)]. The fact they they looked like stunt men wrapped in green carpet sliding along the linoleum in [[BBC]] Studio B, Shepherd's Bush [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd%27s_Bush#Entertainment] only added to the unworldly terror.

==The bacteria who killed the Martians==

[[Tom Cruise]] and [[John Travolta]] saved the earth from the Marcab Confederacy in ''War Of The Worlds''. Probably.

==The cancer that is making [[/b/]] cough a bit==

[[men|Man flu]]. Almost certainly.

==Syphilis and MRSA==

These are technically germs and should be ignored.

==<s>The Black Death==

According to [[Wikipedia]], this gives you ''bubos'', which is [[Greek]] for owls [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horned_owl]. Hence the expression "This bubonic plaque is a total hoot." (Joke copyright; Ingmar Bergmann [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_seventh_seal].)</s> Deleted due to factual inaccuracy.

==Computer bacteria==

A computer bacteria is a computer program that can reproduce by binary fission and infect a computer. The Satan Bug [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satan_Bug] was first detected on televisions, the forerunner of the Internet, in the early 1970s, whilst a program called "Emergency Moonbase Alpha" was the first computer bacteria to appear "in the wild", feeding on [[lion]]s or something. Computer bacteria attach themselves to the [[Apple]] DOS 3.3 operating system and spread via floppy disk, so no [[iPad]] is safe [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus#History].
