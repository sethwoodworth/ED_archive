# [[Your mom]]
# Anyone who will not have sex with [[you]]. 
# Most [[JEWS]]

== [[Typical]] Snob Lifestyle & Diet ==

Snobs have a well-known taste for fancy [[cheese]] and [[whine|wine]]. They think eating/drinking those things in conjunction with watching C-SPAN makes them [[not gay]], while in reality, they have alienated themselves from all their friends and family, and have nothing better to do than eat fancy cheese and watch C-SPAN all day. 

Snobs are not limited to eating cheese; many have also acquired a taste for [[moar]] [[Rugrats|exotic foods]], such as:
* [[Bear]] Lymph-nodes
* Human [[Scientology|Placentas]]
* And the ever-popular Cajun Iguana Stew :

==Tendency to [[Sell Out]]==
Snobs, if famous, have a tendency to completely [[sell out|fuck over everything they've ever worked for]] in order to gain a few more dollars in their bank accounts. Examples of selling out include:

*Completely disregarding trolling duty, to [[R. Lee Ermey|sell car insurance]].
*Giving up [[hookers and blow]], [[rock|selling music to use]] in [[America|'Murikan]] truck commercials. (Looking at you, Ozzy.)
*Creating [[Andrew W.K.|fucking masterpieces]], then becoming a slave to [[Cartoon Network]].
*Being the [[Kanye West|voice of a generation]], then [[George Carlin|doing a dozen specials for HBO]] and making us all wait a year to see you on [[Comedy Central]].
*Being [[Lebron James]], in any way, shape, or form.

== Self-Proclaimed Snobs ==

*[http://www.lancearthur.com/archives/000172.html lancearthur.com] - "I am a Snob. I look down my nose at people who like American Idol. I think riding the bus is incredibly painful and embarrassing. My underwear has to have a label that includes someone's name, and I don't mean JC Penney. I admit it."
*[http://www.chatiryworld.co.uk/100things/100things.htm Chatiry World] - "I am a snob but this seems to be getting better now I no longer work with the public."
*[http://www.grandiose.com/98/981109.html From The Sir Charles Grandiose Archives] - "'Dear Sir Charles,' began the innocent-looking message. 'You are a snob.' Immediately one was taken aback. A snob? Could it have been the recent statement, 'One feels quite strongly that were Dante alive today, the great architect of the afterlife himself would have reserved a special and torturous space in the lowest of the sub-basements of Hell for those who visit ''Taco Bell'''? Perhaps one should have not been quite so vehement. Level B14 should be sufficient for these cretins."
*[http://smartypants.diaryland.com/030303.html The Smartypants Diaries] - "Things that I am a snob about: 1. Wine. Instead of focusing on [[Iraq]], we should bomb the fuck out of the people who invented white zinfandel."
