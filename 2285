'''[[Disney]]''' also known as '''Das Mausefalle''' (The Mousetrap) is an [[Co$|entertainment company]], created by [[freemason|Walt Disney]]. ([[hitler| See also]]). Upon posthumous commands from F端hrer Disney himself, current Disney [http://en.bab.la/dictionary/german-english/kompaniefuehrer Kompanief端hrer] Robert Iger commands troops from (insert insane number) factions of [[old media]] as well as [[teh]] [[internets]]. With the use of said troops, Kompanief端hrer Iger furthers the eventual goal to make us all brainwashed, 16 year old, yiffing [[gays|flamersticks]] so that we may be the [[hookers and blow| hookers to his Blow]]. Above all, Disney is a master at the art of [[IRL]] trolling, sending [[Lindsay Lohan |16 year old]] [[Britney Spears|stars ]][[Vanessa Hudgens|out to their doom.]]

== Disney History ==

[[Pedophilia|Disney]] was started at the same time as McDonalds, when two Swedish [[midgets]] called [[Juggalo|Ronald McDonald]] and [[Hitler|Walt Disney]] turned to each other in their concentration camp cell and started scheming the best ways to pwn [[loli|children]]'s [[cunt|money]]. Their dastardly jew plan was to create food and films that appeal to [[pedophiles]] who would spend all their money in cinemas and restaurants, watching children having fun. 
<center><youtube>XWlLgUcOv7g</youtube></center>

After pedophilia became illegal in 1948, in his depression Walt Disney created [[creepypasta|suicidemouse.avi]] in a vengeful attempt to cause the mass suicide of children. He had to appeal to other audiences, so Disney started preying on colored folk. 
[http://www.youtube.com/v/kGbqBxXckJU&rel=1] But slavery was abolished and white-ass crackers forgot black people existed and only about 100 people saw the cartoon. Disney's next move was at multiculturalism, to show people of all races having fun and living in harmony.
[http://www.youtube.com/v/NIxHfwhckcs&rel=1]

Disney also cared about animals and liked to push innocent [[lemmings]] off of cliffs.

But that was [[bullshit]] and Disney was banned from [[the internets]], so he got a job making serious news programs for the [[azns]] and was criticized when [[Japan]]ese people wrote in, complaining that they could tell the difference between the characters.
[http://www.youtube.com/v/pjLfyooJQEc&rel=1]

So Disney gave up and made pro-Nazi films. These were received with universal acclaim. Since everyone hated everyone else and every child wanted to be a Nazi. Herren Hare, Meister Mouse and Fuhrer Frog became the most popular cartoon characters EVAR!!!![http://youtube.com/watch?v=a406qxVPbsw]
[http://www.youtube.com/v/by3FVKdaQyE&rel=1]

Walt Disney died in 1975 (actually nobody really cares when he died) breaking his neck while fellating himself. Some time later his brother Ray "Krock" Disney tried to merge the company with McDonalds. After this failed his other brother and sometimes lover, Roy, took over and ran the company into the ground by releasing terrible movies. In 1980 he was slaughtered in a coup by Michael the Eisner who ruled with an iron fist. His known sexscapades with the seven dwarves stirred much controversy. Most recently Mr. Eisner was killed by an assassin in a Goofy costume, rumored to be [[Steve Jobs]].

Nowadays, the only people who watch Disney are creepy bastard furfags, who like to [[fap|pretend they're fellating "the Beast"]] or something similarly sick, with Minnie Mouse, etc. The other audience seems to be [[fat]] 20 year old girls, who obsess about Disney, because they have such a princely high standard. They will settle for a drunken [[Man points|wife-beater]] at age 30.

==The Disney Theme Park==

[[Orgy]] Time!

Disneyland (AKA [[Israel|Der J端denland]]) is known for being the shittiest place in the universe, since you have to wait several hours in the line, just to be in the ride around 10 minutes and listen to a 30 minute speech about how short life is. Normal people stay as far away as possible because (cost aside) it is filled with single, 40 something [[feminists]] dragging their [[loli|10 year old daughters]] around by the arm, [[goths]], [[gays]], [[fatties]], [[emos]], [[Eurofags]] and a few [[Japanese]]. The only good thing to pass time there is [[Trolling|revealing the truth]] and [[for the lulz|watching]] how the little kids are scared to death when Mickey Mouse takes off his head to show the person that really is. Which is what the kids deserve.You would have to be some kind of [[sick fuck]] to enjoy dressing up like a [[cosplay|cartoon character]] and [[childlove|touching kids]].

The only thing [[moar]] stupid than the park itself are the people who buy year-long passes. They are those [[zombie]]-like [[basement dwellers]] who show up [[all caps|EVERY FUCKING DAY]], believe that they have the same entitlement as the company's executives and shareholders and be super [[anal]] about "their park" and therefore get pissed when they are treated the same as everyone else or find a screw missing from a trashcan, then put dirty diapers inside the towel hampers instead of using 'that broken trashcan'. These peoples [[lulz]] is to piss off everyone around them as much as they can, then complain to the employees so they can get as much free crap from Disney as possible. They can be spotted by the [[Mr. T]] style necklaces covering their shoulders. Instead of being made of [[Money|gold]], 80's and [[win]], the "lanyards" as they are called are covered in pins that are pure [[AIDS]] and [[FAIL]]. These pins are a status symbol; the more you have the cooler you are and they are often traded for money, sexual favors and sold at exorbitant prices to children trying to get in on the trading fun. The [[pornography|artsy photographer]] pass holders flock around the characters proving that ''they too'' are closet [[furries]]. Commonly these pass holders will drone on about how terrible or awful things are in the parks and in the same sentence will tell you about how they keep up with all the changes no matter how insignificant. The term most belched from the pass holders or "p'assholes" as they show their Disney issued I.D. card is "how much of a discount do I get?". If they wanted to save money they would have not spent $10.00 on a hamburger or $5.00 on a drink.

Keep in mind there are only a few ways to see Disney parks:
#When it is crowded and hot as fuck
#Crowded and raining ([[Christian|Christmas]])
#When there are boards and walls up over most of the park, which is about 70% of the time.

When you do get to see everything you find that Disney Parks have 4 fun types of rides. There is a dark ride with [[Drug|black lights and swerving cars]], boat rides through tunnels - there are several of these, all giving you a "[[Goatse|tour]]", spin rides and roller coaster rides. Once you've waited in line long enough to pass out from the heat and get inside, it is customary to close the ride just after waiting a little over one hour. This usually results in [[rage]] by those who have dared to [[Idiot|think]] anything is actually going to change since the last time they tried. The rage from those turned away can be a source of great fun to those only wishing to [[Lurker|observe other people]]. To increase the effect, inform those people who are going to complain that [[Crybaby|crying]] is [[Anti-Americanism|anti-american]] and not supporting Disney means [[Mujahideen Video|Al Qaida]] wins.

[[Lollercoaster|Fat people also get stuck in the rides causing closures]]. It is almost impossible to witness, but worth every second of wait to watch them squealing like a stuck [[pig]]. Considered by many as the reason to even go on the rides.

==Disney movies==

Disney got rich by making, or rather shitting all over, movies of stories that had been public domain since at least the 1800s. However they will sue and threaten anybody else who tries the same thing, claiming theft of Intellectual Property or some other excuse to cover up their [[butthurt]].

In a typical Disney movie, they sing to death about love and life and emo crap. The goal of Disney movies is to enable parents to avoid spending time with their families and save a few bucks on a [[babysitter]]. Just put a Disney dvd, press play and you can have [[buttsecks]] with your wife, husband, or have a happy family incest with your sister or your teenager daughter, while the little children enjoy retarded crap such as ''[[jailbait|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[emo|The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' or ''Cars''.

Over 99% of Disney movies depict some [[16-year-old girl]] liking some [[Fucktard]] just because he is famous, aristocratic or has money. This is where being true to life ends. Except that one movie in which this [[Loli|girl]] is kidnapped, raped and ends up with [[Stockholm syndrome]]. Why don't they foreshadow life itself for a change, and quit filling kids' heads with notions of happy endings and [[Penis|talking candle sticks]]?

==Disney Today==
[[Image:Donald Duck delivers.gif|thumb|Disney is [[Pr0n|family entertainment]]]]

<s> Disney is now known for its family entertainment </s> . The sordid history has long since been forgotten by [[Jew-ish|all but a few]], and, thus, people get very upset when you disparage any of Disney's otherwise clean-cut characters. Disney now makes only movies geared toward [[12 year old girls]], such as [[Camp rock]]. They also churn out awful direct-to-video sequels and take credit for films made by other, better companies such as Miramax and [[Pixar]].

Thus, all of Disney's revenue now comes from its TV shows, [[Lindsay Lohan]] and its popular theme parks, Disneyland and Disneyworld (The fact that Disneyland is located in [[Orange County]], [[California]] and Disneyworld is located in Orange County, [[Florida]] is to pay homage to how Walt loved having cans of Agent Orange shoved in his ass).

Disney owns some land in [[Europe]], where actors are encouraged to [[yiff]] on camera[http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_inc/3531836.html], which is the only exciting thing to happen there since most people there prefer theme parks based on their own crappy characters.

Disney has been very busy hiring sick pedophile fucks into their company. This practice is very prominent in the last few years, as shown in the making of [[Loli]] and Stitch, a cartoon about extraterrestrial bestiality, Winnie the Pooh and other stuff that nobody dares to point out, for [[Conspiracy theorists|fear of being pwnt by the Disnimati]].

They just [http://letsgoviral.com/disney-buys-marvel/ bought Marvel Comics]. Enjoy the [[crossover]] comics and movies.

===Television Shows===

When Disney creates a show, they'll almost always cancel it around 65 episodes. As a rule, all Disney shows must have the character's name in the title. Recent pieces of shit released have been titled [[Shit_Nobody_Cares_About|"''Hannah Montana''", "''The Suite Life of Zack and Cody''", "''Life with Derek''", "''JONAS''", "''Phil of the Future''"]] and "''That's So Raven''". Notice that the stars of these shows also have [[Shit|music careers]]. [[Pedo Baiting|"Corey In The House" is a popular show, largely because of a young girl, "Madison Pettis"]]. A trademark of a Disney show is its hideous puns, typical characters, and forced laugh-tracks. Of course, this is fucking [[Shit|hilarious]].

=== Make your own Disney movie plot ===
[[Image:AdultBabyDisneyPrincesses.jpg|thumb|[[Rule 34|No Exceptions]]]]
Follow this simple outline and you too can produce your own [[Lame|blockbuster hit]] and make millions of dollars:

''Once upon a time in a faraway land, there lived a young (boy/girl) who had tragically lost (his/her) (mother/father/both parents). One day, an (evil/old/homosexual/ethnic stereotype) villain devises a (sinister plot) and takes over the entire kingdom with (bumbling, comic-relief sidekick) voiced by (Gilbert Gottfried/Cheech Marin/Patrick Warburton/The guy who played Charles on M*A*S*H). [[Asking for it|Though shy and reluctant at first, our hero eventually rises up]] with courage after suffering another horribly traumatic event somehow involving said dead parents. With the help of a (talking animal/fat guy/inanimate object) voiced by (Robin Williams/John Goodman/Tim Allen/Rosie O'Donnell/The guy who played Charles on M*A*S*H), (he/she) will defeat the villain despite impossible odds and everybody learns a lesson about (kindness/honesty/friendship/family values/[[whatever]]). Just add a soundtrack with (Christina Aguilera/Hilary Duff/[[Elton John]]) and you're set.''

=="Role Models"==
[[File:Charm.jpg|thumb|My Point..]]

[[last thursday |Since the creation]] of Disney, [[bullShit|they've been a really big help]] in [[raping|getting]] [[lolis|little girls]]'s [[Bitch, please|self esteem]] [[irony|up]]. It first started with [[Sluts|Disney Princess]], who [[damage|helped]] as much as Barbie girl, but, as opposed to Barbie making every [[Shaniqua|black girl]] wish that they'd [[Retarded|straight]] hair. Disney Princess make every 1-90 year old girl/woman wait for the [[Unrealistic expectations|shining prince charming]]. Which, is the reason why [[you]]'re a [[Virgin]].
