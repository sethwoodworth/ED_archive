Zombie Nazi
[[Image:Zomlake12.jpg|thumb|The worst kind.]]
Zombie Nazis are a common problem in today's society. Often showing up unannounced, eating brains with out warning, and killing Jews for LULZ. More often then not, Zombie Nazis crash birthday parties and if you shout "Hey, Koolaid!" 4 times out of ten, they will show up instead of the Koolaid man and eat your flesh.

Also, Zombie Nazis opened up a Subway alternative just for Zombies, the only difrence between the two franchisees if the motto "Subway, eat flesh!".

Except for in [[Call of Duty: Black Ops|Call of Doody: Black Cocks]], where there's office zombies too. Those fags don't have a life, literally.
