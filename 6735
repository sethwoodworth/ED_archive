Similar to [[deleting your LiveJournal]], '''quitting [[IRC]] forever''' is generally an [[attention]]-getting ploy. People who regularly use IRC are more likely to gouge out their own eyeballs with a rusty spoon than to quit IRC for more than a week. The [[real world]] equivalent is [[suicide|'''quitting IRL forever''']]

Netadmins literally "take their ball and go home," as they shut down their IRC servers when they quit "IRC FOREVER". [[cj_]] used this tactic for [[idlenet]] when sisko called him a "douche".

== Actually quitting IRC forever ==

Some irc'ers decide to quietly slink fom the IRC spotlight after mass ruinage or making a complete [[fgt]] of themselves. One example of this is [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]], who quit IRC after threatening to sue, kill and imprison [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] over accused "identity theft", then had his ass handed to him on channel by [[User:Zionistacat|Zionistacat]] and Chimi.  Recently, ajt has quit IRC forever due to Sherrod hating on him for banning everyone and making lulz.
