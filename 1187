The man. THE MAVERICK. '''Broncofn90''' is a [[forced meme]], closet Rick Flair fan, Russian gymnastics enthusiast, and internet [[vlog]]ger. 

== The Beginning ==
After being rejected from the George Lopez show after [[George Lopez]] himself told him to go "Die in a car crash because [[shit nobody cares about|no one cares]]", Broncofn90 tried to join the [[homosexuality|pink russian gymnastics team]] but even they said he was a [[douchebag]] and [[pwned]] his ass. Some scientists believe this to be the reasons he has a fucked up face, while others believe he is the offspring of [[SUPERCOOLWILLOW]] and [[Numa numa|Mr. Numa numa]]. Because both of Broncofn90's parents are [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]], [[Sick fuck]]s, and [[Goatse]] lovers, they abused him as a child, which made Broncofn90 realize he's a [[You fail it|failure at life]]. This sparked Broncofn90 to go on Jewtube and tell everyone about how much he loves [[Bestiality|Bronco cock]] and would have an [[orgy]] with everyone on the Denver Broncos team and anyone affiliated with the Denver Broncos. The Denver Broncos never denied this, perhaps because they felt bad for the kid or maybe because they're all [[Chris crocker|fags]].

Broncofn90 inspired [[lulz|epic lulz]] on [[Jewtube]] when the [[troll|unfriendly folk]] of the community first caught wind of Bronco's [[retard|special]] face. Bronco was giving his [[shit_nobody_cares_about|opinion]] on some American football game when everybody decided that it would be funnier to troll the shit out of his comments page. This resulted in much [[emo|teen angst]] for the [[fat|chubby]] young fellow, and he became [[Deleting_your_Youtube_Videos|an internets hero]] in a rant of two parts [[fail]] and one part lulz.

A source of much amusement to all was Bronco's assumption that people would not take the piss out of his [[Brian_Peppers|fat, monged face]] and its amusing stroke-like sloping effect. Betraying him like the Jew fuckturds they are, Jewtube's users [[Spam|spammed]] his page with deep comments like "[[Abortion|The coat hanger didn't finish it's job.]]"

Bronco deleted his [[E-Tantrum|tirade]] shortly after posting it, but a [[/b/tard]] resurrected it for the lulz.

==Obviously His Last Video Was Not His Last Video==

Because people want to know what the fuck is wrong with his face.
