'''A GHETTO''' may be any or all of these:

# A charming neighborhood inhabited almost exclusively by wealthy [[gay|Sodomites]], with the city's most convenient and timely public transit service, dozens of sickenly shiny [[cum]]-stained ATM machines, twink "sk8tr-dudes" giving blow-jobs to 70 year old men for $20 in the Starbucks bathroom, gay porn movies being filmed in parked SUVs on the main thoroughfare, using the city's actual cops; anonymous [[fellatio]] and [[buttsecks|fornication]] rampantly being performed by clean-cut realtors upon cowboys and soldiers in every doorway and balcony, etc. Let your imagination run wild, let the rainbow be your guide, and you couldn't possibly imagine the nauseating, obscene debaucheries and perversions going on here at all hours, not even in your most disgusting nightmares. 
# A filthy and very run-down high-crime area inhabited by TYPICAL [[negro]] and/or [[Mexican]] people.
# A poor but well-situated and rather quaint Polish neighborhood formerly inhabited by [[Jews]] before they invented the [[Holocaust]] and became rich.
# An epithet indicating the poor quality or improvised nature of the subject. Used primarily by [[Keanu Reeves|time-travellers]] from the 1990s.
# [[YOU]]
