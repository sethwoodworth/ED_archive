Daniel J. Bernstein
Daniel J. Bernstein (DJB) is a [[l33t]] [[h4x0r]] and professor of mathematics at [[Rutgers University|UIUC]]. He is the author of qmail and djbdns, a mailer and a DNS server noted for their secure design and association with epic [[trolling]].

Qmail is notable for its [[shit nobody cares about|software license]], which forbids redistribution of modified versions. This of course [[drama|raised the hackles]] of [[Lunix]] [[fanboys]] for whom principle demands that software be [[Richard Stallman|free]]. 

DJB was the source of much [[lulz]] on the [[OpenBSD]] mailing lists when he [[kibo|swooped in]] to defend qmail's licensing policy after [[Theo de Raadt]] removed it from [[OpenBSD]]. The resulting flamewar ended in the infamous rejoinder:

No it has never been on the CD. The most restrictive source or binary
license on the CD is the GPL. I don't think vim or pine or pico made
it on either, since their licenses have tiny restrictions.

Why do you sign your email twice?
