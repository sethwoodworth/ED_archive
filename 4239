Jay Bundy
Once upon a time in a land far far away known as Penn State University, a brave [[nigra]] emerged during the [[faggot|fagtastic]] events that happen at every college in the world where [[retard|qualified individuals]] staple fliers to poles and hand out [[crack]] laced candy in hopes of [[moron|eagerly participating students]] voting for them so they have privileged rights to the faculty lounges where they more effectively lick the assholes of tenured professors.

==Self Proclaimed 'Worst Student Body President Ever'==

Jay Bundy entered the so-called campus political race on a platform of being blunt, offensive, and pointing out that the people who participate in this pseudo-political nonsense really are [[morons]] for doing so. Bundy's political opponent, who was also named Jay, attempted to overcome the opposition with calling himself the "Best Jay in Town" but beautifully still managed to lose despite the fact his opponent was promising to do the worst job possible and achieve the [[lulz]]worthy goal of having a lower approval rating than the entire nation's current President.

===Quotes===
''If the students are stupid enough to vote for someone so inappropriate and retarded as I am, then they deserve a president who is going to give the worst performance to the best of his ability.'' - Jay Bundy

''Using my appropriate French, I finalized that with the word shitshow. If people were offended by that, I apologize. We’re gonna say sweet nothings on the record all day long. Cut. Quote. Print. That’s sounds a lot better than no comment. It’s all a game.'' - Jay Bundy

It would not be surprising in the least if Jay Bundy was in fact one of the many members among the [[an hero|heroic]] internet raider group [[Patriotic Nigras]].

==Banned from the Presidency?!==

Due to some shit like an "unstamped flier" or spending $34.06 over the 'legal' limit for use in campaigns on the college. This leaves [[Anonymous]] to wonder... where the hell did he get money in the first place? And considering the flood of money that is spent every 4 years in the US voting [[attention whore|officials]], since when was there ever a legal spending limit on advertising? [[Anonymous]] calls shenanigans since Penn State University has their thumbs up the ass of at least one senator in congress to get more [[bling|school funding]].
