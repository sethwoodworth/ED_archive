The Tigerwolf Effect
'''The Tigerwolf Effect''' is an [[Internet law]] concerning the behavior of normal [[internets]] users when encountering a [[lolcow]] behaving in a non-[[lulz]]y fashion. It particularly applies to [[LiveJournal]] [[snark]] [[communities]].

Most commonly the effect is found in [[SF Drama]], along with [[Stupid free]].

==The law==
'''If a person has been wrong or stupid even once on a certain forum, users of that forum will disagree with or mock anything that person says in the future, even if that person is right.'''


==Why Tigerwolf?==
[[Tigerwolf]] is a [[furfag]] with strange ideas about anatomy, [[childfree|freetardism]], and proper customer service. He has said some unbelievably stupid things on these and other subjects, as his article and his [http://community.livejournal.com/stupid_free/tag/tigerwolf stupid_free tag] suggest.

For a period of several months in 2007, Tigerwolf went without saying anything particularly stupid. When asked, he said that he had dumped a dramariffic boyfriend and several associated friends, and that his life had improved to the point that he no longer felt the urge to pick fights on [[LiveJournal]] as often as he once had.

However, despite his (in the end, temporary) restoration of sanity, almost every post he made had at least one self-appointed [[dramacrat]] posting [[clever]] comments like "SELF-CLEANING ANUS LOL" or "IN B4 TIGERWOLF WANK." This happened even when he agreed with everyone else in the community. [[Some argue]] that his eventual return to form was due to his reasoning that, if everyone was going to treat him like a [[troll]] anyway, he might as well act like one.

Tigerwolf is the canonical example of this effect in action.

==Other examples==
*{{lj|shaky_girl}} and {{lj|meupatdoes}} got into an argument about [http://community.livejournal.com/stupid_free/869063.html?thread=147522247#t147522247 parental rights]. {{lj|shaky_girl}} decided that she had TOTALLY [[PWNED]] her opponent because {{lj|meupatdoes}} had been featured previously in [[Stupid free]], and [http://community.livejournal.com/stupid_free/869243.html?thread=147550075#t147550075 declared victory]. However, {{lj|shaky_girl}} was demonstrably wrong, and refused to concede the point until other, more respected LJ users corrected her; even then, she fell back on the old "[[No life|you have too much time on your hands!]]" defense.
*[[Yellowsnakepoet]], noted lolcow, posts in [[Customers suck]] about a guy asking her questions about her love life. Even though she's known for whining about her [[virgin]]ity, the guy is still being creepy and inappropriate, so her post isn't stupid. {{lj|deathslilsister}} posts the incident to {{ljcomm|stupid_free}} anyway, and is convicted of massive fail by [http://community.livejournal.com/stupid_free/976048.html other members].
*Since {{lj|aria_star}} has an eating disorder, some people feel the need to alert the internets [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/457617.html every time] [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/457145.html she makes] [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1429997.html a post].

==The role of snark==
Snark communities play a significant role in perpetuating the Tigerwolf Effect on LJ. This is partly because they serve as a lulz archive, allowing users to look up past drama; however, they also instill a sense of [[unwarranted self-importance]] in their members. Posting a "good snark" will get a user dozens or even hundreds of positive comments in the major communities, so [[attention whore]]s scour LJ for good material.

A common symptom of the Tigerwolf Effect is people posting under a title like "I sense impending drama!" or "There's nothing here ''right now'', but I bet it's gonna be stupid!" Others just post anything at all from a lolcow regardless of content, thinking that creating quality drama is as simple as remembering something someone said once and repeating it IN [[ALL CAPS]].

==Isn't this just calling for a [[raid]]?==
No. Most LJ snark comms have a specific rule ''against'' raiding. Joining a community specifically to troll someone is considered bad form, and trolling personal journals is right out, leaving members with no acceptable methods for generating lulz. Therefore, posting about a lolcow is completely useless unless s/he is ''actually doing something funny'' -- a concept that most users simply don't get.
