The good [[Christian]] [[government]] of America has a long and tenuous relationship with the [[Internets]] and thankfully '''Obscenitycrimes.org''' is here to help them keep it [[homosexual|satanic d√¶mon]] free. They acknowledge that, while the internet is indeed [[Serious Business]], many users seek to use this new technology to spread n00dz and [[Goatse]]. To deal with this growing problem, they have enlisted the aid of God-fearing [[Lawyer]]s who they pay [[over 9000]] dollars to bitch to the feds when they see titties. These arbiters of holy justice are known as '''[http://www.obscenitycrimes.org/ Morality in Media Inc.]'''

ObscenityCrimes.org even provides a form for God's Warriors to fill out. By checking boxes vigilant citizens can alert their US Attorneys to "Lewd Exhibition of the Genitals" and other felonious breaches of common decency. Despite over 67,000 complaints filed, no prosecutions are forthcoming. The Godless US attorneys are ignoring pr0n, the real crime, because they're too busy sentencing negroes to daily ass-poundings. Meanwhile our sons wank helplessly to nubile camwhores, their pasty erections firmly in the grip of the devil himself.

Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be any forums where [[Goatse]] and [[Tubgirl]] can be posted, but you can sign them up for lots of [[furry]] [[pr0n]] using the address [mim@moralityinmedia.org]
