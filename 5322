[[Image:Beforemetal.jpg|thumb|Same difference.]] '''Heavy metal''' is often mistaken for music, when it is actually made of [[fail]] and [[Aids]]. The "lyrics" are always about [[otherkin|elves]], [[faggot|pixies]], [[fail|dragons]], [[an hero|suicide]], [[Satan]], [[13 year old boys|getting grounded by your mom]], hatred for girls who won't put out, [[violence|murder]], and [[shit nobody cares about]].
Metal is usually mistaken for [[emo]] "music", but there is 1 difference. Emos cut themselves and 'metalheads' cut other people <i> and</i> themselves.<span style="color:white">

[[Image:Scary_album_cover.jpg|thumb|right|Black Sabbath's debut album has a 'scary' cover!]]

==A short history of metal plus other "important" stuff==
Heavy metal: where any one-balled, short-dicked, ass-faced, shitheaded, cock-sucking, motherfucker with a guitar can make a band.
[[Image:Metallica_-_Jump_in_the_Fire.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sarcasm|Thanks for all the AIDS]].]]

Black Sabbath released several [[shit]] albums that sold well to [[angst]]-ridden teens. Then Ozzy took lots of drugs and became the pathetic croaking dwarf-man-thing he is today.
Black Sabbath paved the way for more [[gay]]-ass bands like AC/DC, which eventually helped the genre 'evolve' into [[something awful]]:
* Pantera went from EXTREMELY [[gay]] glam metal and moved to the "listen-able" [[hell]] that is now "groove metal".
* Judas Priest gave metal its [[gay]] "fashion sense" and also [[an hero|made some of its fans commit suicide]], which was the only useful thing ever done by a metal band.
* [[Metallica]] came along and [[shit|shat]] on metal with all their might and <s>created</s> popularize and ruin a genre that had potential to be good called "thrash". However, they decided to [[rape|ass rape]] Napster so much so that we have to [[money|pay]] for music so that Lars Ulrich can have a fucking gold-plated shark tank next to his cesspool full of [[semen]]. The [[shit]] they played was very [[gay|inspirational]] to bands like Pantera who proceeded to spawn [[shit]]-for-brains metalcore bands and pollute the world.
[[TL;DR]] [[Shitting Dick Nipples|METAL WAS MADE BY DICKS WHO SHAT TOO MUCH]], RECORDED IT, [[Lie|AND CALLED IT "MUSIC".]]

[[Image:PowerMetal.jpg|thumb|right|Power metal fans think their music is [[hardcore]] when it's really [[shit]].]]
'''Power metal''' is the [[Juliana Wetmore]] of the [[metal]] world, and is made by mixing good,traditional metal music with [[homosexuality]]. Since it is so hideous to listen to (and is rumored to have [[AIDS]] due to the inherent faggotry), most people with any common sense cover their ears at the very mention of it. Every power metal song, whether 3 or 30 minutes long, consists of a few necessary ingredients. First, a drum machine must be used because no human is capable of playing the exact same drum beat for every power metal song evar. This makes it even shittier [[IRL]]. The guitar tracks are also sped up.

== Power Metal Fashion ==
[[Image:Power_quest.jpg|thumb|right|Typical CD cover.]]
Power metal bands are often [[LARP]]ers or are otherwise involved in [[cosplay]], and never seem to be out of costume. Their hair resembles that of a gay [[hippie]] - in other words, long and messy, but styled with shampoos that cost [[at least 100]] dollars a bottle. You know, because that's really metal. The singers wear pants similar to what [[emo]]/[[scene]] kids wear, in an apparent effort to try to lure them away from the depressing [[emo]] market and draw them to the [[fail|S0 EP1C!!11!!1]] world of power metal.
== Power Metal [[Fantard]]s ==
The power metal [[fandom]] is rather small, since most people recognize that the music is [[TL;DR]] and [[gay]] by nature. Power metal fans are normally [[fat]] [[aspie]] [[basement-dweller]]s with [[neckbeard]]s, and the rest are [[13-year-old boy]]s who will soon descend into the same fate. Many are LARPers and the rest play ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. Many do both. These people claim to connect with the [[shit]] lyrics because it's [[no|so much like their lives]].
== Power Metal Lyrics ==
[[Image:Dragonforcechart.jpg|thumb|right|Word count on DragonForce's Inhuman Rampage CD.]]
If you thought [[emo]] poetry was bad, just read this shit. The lyrics are the same universally, talking about fire, flames, glory, the sky, heaven, dragons, battle, swords, and allusions to [[buttsecks]]. This [[copypasta]] should explain some of it. Below, some examples are included for your enjoyment.

<div id="pm" style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black;">
#You have one goal: be epic.
#Let no sound be lonely. If there’s a guitar solo, harmonize it. If there’s singing, make it a [[circle jerk|choir]].
#Keyboards offer a way to add thousands of different textures to a song. Find two of those that you like and use them on every song you write.
#On second thoughts fuck your shitty little keyboard. USE A FUCKING MASSIVE [[Penis|ORGAN]] WITH EVERY STOP PULLED OUT AS FAR AS IT WILL GO!
#In a power metal world, everything steel is good, and anything good must be compared to steel.
#You are not bound to sing about [[Satan]], [[evil]], and/or darkness.
#You are bound to sing about dragons, freedom, and/or power metal.
#Remember how no sound should be alone? Same goes for albums. Everything can have a sequel!
#You are allowed to be blonde.
#Swords enhance your credibility and your performance. Be sure to carry one regardless of whether or not you know anything about using one.
#Pick a theme and stick to it. Manowar are [[lie|warriors of true metal]], and they don’t get to sing about anything else. Rhapsody has their Algalord chronicles. Hammerfall has their steel, [[cocks|hammers]], and [[Starcraft|templar]]. Running Wild has [[pirate]]s. Iron Savior has sci-fi. Edguy has the gays. Blind Guardian has Tolkien. None of them are allowed to sing about anything else.
#If you have to sing about something else, put together a side project to do it. [[Fail|Avantasia]] is the perfect [[internet model|model]].
#Ballads are permissible.
#That doesn’t mean your ballads can [[fellatio|suck]].
#The longer a song is, the more epic it is. See rule #1.
#More solos means more epic.
#If at all possible, be Michael Kiske. 
#If this is not possible, pretend to be Michael Kiske.
#Your album cover should include at least one of the following: fire, steel, weird glowing magical items, [[gay|irregularly muscular men]], fists thrust into the air, weaponry, magic creatures (preferably dragons), or bright beams of light around somebody/something.
#[[Black metal|‘Grim’ and ‘necro’]] don’t apply here; they just make you look silly. Now go back to singing your 20 minute epic about dragonslaying!
#Power metal depends on power chords.
#16th notes are the only notes.
#Unless you’re singing, in which case you are not permitted to hold a note for any less than 2 bars.
#Keyboards get solos, too.
#If you can’t be [[fag|Michael Kiske]], you can at least be [[gay|Timo Tolkki]].
#Actually, [[God hates fags|don’t be Timo Tolkki]].
#In case you didn’t know, “symphonic” is synonymous with “epic.” See rule #1.
#Just because 300 bands before you have already done “[[EFG|epic]],” there’s always room for more.
#Songs come in [[less than three|two]] tempos: metal and ballad.
#You are officially the only group of people who can refer to themselves as ‘mighty’ without being laughed at. Much.
#Audiences need to be able to [[masturbate|sing along]]. Make it catchy.
#Sing in English, even though your fan-base will be comprised entirely of Brazilians, Germans, Japanese, Swedes, and Finns. See rule #30: if it’s not catchy, it’s harder to sing in [[Engrish|a language that is not your first]].
#Play in as many bands as possible. More side projects and guest appearances means more epic!
#[[Emo|Tight. Pants.]]
#You don’t have to detune your guitars.
#Though you probably should drop them a half-step.
#Unfortunately, you need at least two guitar players. How else are you going to have dueling guitar solos?
#Keyboards may substitute for one guitar player, as long as they can solo.
#Fortunately, you don’t need a bass player! Or at least, you never have to use the same bassist twice.
#Begin all songs with one big swelling chord on the keyboard.
#Acoustic guitars are allowed. Sometimes.
#It’s not a tour, it’s a [[Christianity|crusade]]!
#Layer your vocals, [[over 9000|hundreds upon hundreds]] of times. Don’t worry about them live.
#Never use mundane words in your lyrics. Nothing is epic if you don’t use words like “majesty,” “glorious,” “magical,” and so on.
#Wizards! You need wizards!
#Although your costume does not require corpse paint, it will require a cape, lots of jewelry, and the aforementioned swords.
#Unless you are Manowar, in which case you are [[ghey|too metal for clothing]].
#Come to think of it, don’t be Manowar.
#[[LARP|Wear armor if at all possible]]. Hammerfall can give you an idea of the variety of acceptable armors, ranging from leather to ring-mail.
#Songs don’t begin at full speed. Gradually work your way into an epic frenzy.
#Hail true metal!
#Acoustic guitars are for intros and bridges. Then crush them with steel.
#Epic. Tight. Pants.
#Higher vocals are epic vocals. Female lead singers are great for this. See [[Yu-Gi-Oh|Dawn of Destiny]] for an example.
#So, male lead singes should sound like female singers. See rule #52.
#[[Noone|True warriors]] can tell the difference between albums.
#Concept albums are totally epic. Nobody will ever see it coming.
#Liner notes must include pages of backstory, either of your epic saga of conquest over dragons and evil or of your epic battles with [[alcoholism]] while recording the album.
#[[Drugs]] aren’t metal.
#Beer, however, can be served in all kinds of true metal ways.
#“Flagons of ale.” It’s appropriate to your fantasy-riddled lyrics, and it almost looks like “dragons,” so [[you win the prize|you score extra points]].
#Since you can’t get away with grunts, growls, and other [[troll]]-like noises, you will have to sing.
#Your accent will show as a consequence.
#To compensate, sing about [[internet humanitarianism|killing trolls]]. Preferably with the swords that you carry onstage.
#More sequels = more epic. See rule #7.
#Guest vocalists, guest guitarists, and any special appearances from outside your band will make your sound more epic, even if the track sounds just like all the other songs on the album with an extra solo.
#Norsk Arysk Blak Metal! Rahhh!!!
#Begin songs at half-tempo, and then, when listeners least expect it (i.e. at exactly the same time it happens in all your other songs) kick into full speed complete with double-bass and power chords.
#Bass players: [[fap|one note. Really fast]].
#But include one enormous crazy-ass bass fill before the chorus, even though the production will bury you so far in the mix that most people won’t realize your band has a bass player.
#Just because you don’t play black metal doesn’t mean you can’t use Tolkien.
#Whenever you short of ideas, pick up your [[Dungeons and Dragons]] books. You might as well be the first band to sing about owlbears.
#Never leave Europe.
#For purposes of rule #73, [[Japan]] and colonies of [[Wapanese]] may be counted as part of Europe.
#Oh, and South America was colonized by Europeans, so it can count too.
#Orchestras make a great addition to your album. Since you [[poor|can’t afford one]], find a new patch on your keyboard.
#If your live album does not have the crowd singing all the harmony parts for you, you aren’t epic enough to justify a live album.
#If you are European, use as many archaic English words in your lyrics as you can. Obfuscation is epic!
#If you are South American, your lyrics should be closer to standard English, though nobody will ever read them.
#If you are U.S. American, you probably aren’t actually a power metal band. Sing about tanks, or something.
#If you are Italian, write some lyrics in Latin. Your American fans won’t be able to tell the difference between your Italian lyrics and your Latin ones, but Latin is epic.
#Remember, shaving is epic, haircuts are not.
#Entire albums must be recorded in the same key.
#For that matter, entire careers may also be recorded in the same key.
#Guitarists, remember: dun da-da dun da-da dun da-da…
#Make your band logo very angular, but perfectly legible.
#More than a logo, you need a [[furfag|mascot]].
#He need not be distinguishable from Eddie, but he does need to be on all your album covers.
#At your first gig, if you feel a “[[cum|rising force]],” do be sure not to get it all over your audience.
#Record your best songs unplugged, and sell them as an EP.
#Do not expect anyone to buy the EP.
#Remember, power metal fans are [[Lie|not gay]]. They are just [[gay|comfortable with their masculinity]].
#Sing along.
#Don’t get caught singing along.
#Glitter is not epic.
#Neither is body oil. See rule #47.
#If you see a black metaller in the woods pretending to be a [[troll]], see rule #9 and rule #63.
#In your liner notes, thank everybody you toured with, even if they’re Stratovarius.
#Complain about Stratovarius constantly even though you’ve bought all their albums and listen to them more than anything else in your collection.
#Power metal must be pure; do not mix it with other metal styles.
#To repeat: be epic.
#I ran out of funny things to say way back at rule #52, but any less than 101 rules would so not be epic.

[[Image:Poison.JPG|thumb|left|[[Typical]] hair metal band (in this case, Poison). Try to [[Guess the Gender|guess the genders]].]]
In the 1980's there was a trend called "hair metal". The bands all had hair that was looked like this. Yes, a genre of music can be defined by its bands' "hairstyles". Unsurprisingly, the genre was [[gay]], with every band member a [[MTF|transvestite]]. Many useless and untalented bands such as Poison, Ratt, Whitesnake, Mötley Crüe, and Quiet Riot got popular during this time period. The music was played badly and the lyrics were about [[shit nobody cares about|snorting anything that would create some kind of high]]. Can't you just feel their [[faggotry|passion for music]]? Luckily the trend faded out quickly. Today, these hair metal [[fags|"musicians"]] make crappy TV shows on VH1.
Interestingly enough, [[gay|glam]] metal bands usually fucked in terms of actual record sales.

==Metal fans==
[[Image:heavy-metal.jpg|thumb|left|Typical heavy metal fans.]]
[[Image:Dragondick fan.jpg|thumb|left|Dragonforce fan getting butthurt.]]Metal fans start off as spoiled upper-middle class teens who, for being [[Asperger's syndrome|mildly autistic]] and holding their rich dads cock too tight for too long, never managed to develop any social skills or sense of humor above that of a [[13-year-old boy|boy who’ve just reached puberty]].  Generally they start out wanting to be punk rock fags, but get rejected because they are too fat. In frustration over their life being a complete failure, they join up on the internet with equally pathetic souls in their [[Retard|very special]] teenage rebellion trend exclusive for [[IRL|IRL]] bottom-feeders: Downloading (1 metal and (2 [[South Park|south park]] episodes, shape all their views according to these then [[Circle jerk|cry and masturbate each other]] how [[Politically correct|PC]] the rest of the world is, which effectively fulfills all the pubertal asspie desires of angsty rich kids.

The way to be an TRUE METALHEAD!!! Is to be a nonconformist. All you need to do to be one of the nonconformists is to wear the same clothes, listen to the same music, have the same hair,  and act like all the other metalheads.

Most metalheads shit themselves when someone stereotypes metal as "all satanic" or "all screaming". After yelling at you for a few hours for sterotyping metal, they end their rant with, "At least metal is better than rap, all rappers are like, 'WAT UP NIGGAH! CHECK OUT MAH TEEF YO, I FUCK BITCHES AND HOES AND CUM IN THEIR THROATS." which is totally ''not'' stereotyping(But is true anyways, as niggers ALWAYS type their stereotypes and embody them as much as possible).

The majority of metal fans listen to metal and only metal. They will claim to listen to jazz and classical music also [[fact|which both are actually in some metal]]. In reality they will probably own a couple of MP3s of [[Shit|Miles Davis or Holst]], to which they listen to only after smoking [[OVER 9000|profuse amounts]] of pot. They only claim to listen to these styles of music in order to give their tastes some kind of validity, as many would say their favorite genre is some of the [[goatse|worst fuck ever shat out of mankind's ass]]. The [[USI|distinguished metal]] listener listens to a wide variety of skilled musicianship, abstract genres, and is [[basement dweller|dedicated]] to becoming a skilled musician. 


Oh but there are a few [[i'm so confused|troubled souls]] that never grow out of this [[Lie|cool fad]],
These [[fags|champions]] and [[losers|goal achievers]] so often end up working at some [[shit]] job and coming home to a [[fat]] [[MTF|"girlfriend"]]. In conclusion metalheads who don't GROW THE FUCK UP end up being [[losers]] and [[an hero|fail at life]]. Is a [[pretty cool guy]]

[[Image:Gorgoroth.jpg|thumb|right|He hates religion! Hardcore!]]
[[Image:Laynestaley.jpg|thumb|right|Alice in chains, clearly the heaviest not metal band of all time.]]
* Tell them that metal is [[emo]].
* Tell them that you're happy Chuck Schuldiner/Cliff Burton/Ronnie James [[Za Warudo|Dio]]/Randy Rhoads/whoever died, and reap the [[hate|benefits]]. 
* Mention any christian/white/unblack metal band.
* Vikings practiced homosexuality works perfectly among Western/Eastern European heavy metal fans.

* Mention any screamo band.
* Refer to thrash metal as "trash metal".
* Make fun of Jason Becker.
* Ask what their opinion on [[Grunge]] is. If they say it is metal, say that they pulled most of their influences from Punk and Alternative music, and some had set out to destroy (successfully) the Pop Metal of the day. If they say it is not metal, ask them about Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Tad. Bonus if Jesus Christ Pose by Soundgarden is brought out.
* Tell them to bathe and cut their hair (try this over the Internet, as just listening to their screaming after this is a real fuck too much for any [[4chan|normal person]].)(also, don't try this with nu-metalers, or Alternative metal heads, as they are most likely bald.)
* Say [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] was a shoddy guitar player.

* Complain about [[goth]]s and imply that they are one.
* Make the peace sign with your hands instead of the metal horns at concerts (only for professional runners).

* Remind them that Metallica [[Epic fail|lost a Grammy]] to [[Britfag|Jethro Tull]] for '''Best Metal Performance'''.
* Tell them that all the [[black metal]] players [[fact|stole their look from KISS, Arthur Brown and Alice Cooper]].
* Compliment their favorite band and agree with everything they say. Just WATCH their facial expressions.
* 2 words: Limp Bizkit.
* Compare every metal song you hear to DragonForce.
* Tell them Cryptopsy's latest effort is their best yet.
* Say that the majority of metal songs are just smashing power-chords. Then say that all metal bands always use power-chords.
* Tell them "Primus sucks" and see if they get it.
* Tell them that they're not real metalheads (if you're in a metalhead [[orgy|group]]).
* Say [[Shit|Slipknot]] is [[THE BEST|the best]] metal band evar.
* If they're Slipknot fans, make jokes about Paul Gray.
* Say metalcore is the best.
* Tell them that the [[Jonas Brothers]] are better than the bands that they like.
* Show them what the [[FGSFDS|Krautfags]] think of all this:
* Tell them Necrophagist writes crappy music (say its too slow).
* Tell them that [[Hippy|Iron Butterfly]] was the first metal band.
* Tell them Mike Portnoy chose [[Gay|Avenged Sevenfold]] over [[Dream Theater]].
* Say that Opeth writes simple music.
* Talk [[shit]] about Kerry King.
* Talk shit about Bruce Dickinson.
* Say that System Of A Down are moar metal than Judass Priest

[[Image:MetalFamilyTree.Gif|thumb|Sam Dunn's Metal Family Tree. use for trolling. Go nuts.]]

Metalheads are well known for trying to be "hardcore" because they love music about [[funny|gore and killing people]] and [[unfunny|playing guitar the loudest way possible]]. Look at a [[Shit|Cannibal Corpse]] album. Notice the woman who has a monster [[BDSM|ripping out her vagina]]. In reality though, they are pretty much pussies and will faint at any sight of blood, carnage and vermin that they claim to love so much.

You're just a wanker who came and disturbed the wrong place! We are punks and metalheads and don't wanna hear your opinion about Vader (Which is a very good polish band). If you don't like death metal then don't listen to it! We don't like Queen and we don't listens to it! So fuck off your little Queen (Queer) lover and go fuck yourself! And I don't think any of your fucked up Queen fans can beat us! We are an underground society﻿ which stands strong so fuck you and your Queer crap!

====How to troll a metal community in LJ====
It's very easy, all you have to do is follow these steps

#Go and join in a community called {{ljcomm|user=metal_mp3}}.
#Request or post MP3s of any screamo, hardcore, and nu metal bands.
#[[????]]
#[[Profit]][[Oneoneone|!!!11]]

After trolling some [[Norway|Norwegian motherfucker]] named {{lj|user=necrognosis}} will come to your house and [[Cuckoldry|fuck your wife]]. Don't have a wife? [[A Cat Is Fine Too|He'll settle for a beloved pet]] or any children nearby. Then take all your beer and leave. He isn't expected to be around long; the community's owner, {{lj|user=starfall_}} will eventually [[Pwnt|shitcan]] him for [[Lie|kicking too much ass]]. This community only accepts wannabe black metal bands such as [[Cradle of Filth]], [[Dimmu Borgir]], and [[Immortal]], as well as [[shit|folk/viking/pagan]] metal and [[Bitch|fem-fronted]] metal.
