White Paw recently posted pictures of himself in footie-pajamas and a pacifier on his FurAffinity account.  Shortly after, he was jumped on by a number of babyfur trollers (doing God's work.)  He bitched out and deleted the photo.

Afterward, stories of this occurrence appeared on lolfurries.org,  White Paw lashed out at the poster in a YIM conversation, resulting in a second post of the chat log. Babyfag's myspace url was also posted, and at the time had many photos of him pissing his pants.  White Paw quickly reacted to this and deleted -SOME- incriminating photos.
