'''Marcus''' is a troll who frequents [[4chan]].  He is a Level 15 Middle-Class Black and has specialized in ''Extreme Belligerence'' (III), ''Race Baiting'' (VI), ''Deflection'' (II), ''Illusions of Grandeur'' (XXII), ''Net Thug'' (VI), and ''Victim Complex''. (MCXVI)    As a Middle-Class Black, he comes with the inherent racial ''“TV Is Real”'', thinking that the ghetto hardness of his favorite albums could also be preserved on the Internet.

==Origin==
[[Image:Urkel mintah.png|thumb|Image of Mintah taken from his high school yearbook]]
Marcus first came to [[4chan]] on Janurary 23rd, 2005.  For two years, his antics taunted the wrath of many forum regulars.  By October 4th, 2007, Anon had been collecting enough information on this [[namefag]] to prepare a raid against him.  Such legendary boasts as what is below eventually lead to his downfall.

<br><center><i><font size="2">“you think you white nerds can get me?  im fucking marcus mintah smith.  ill post whatever the fuck i want when i want faggots”</font></i></center><br>

Within two weeks, Marcus ceased posting on 4chan, but a startling description of what Anon had uncovered came to light:

<br><center><i><font size="2">“in high school, this dude was short tempered and would always get mad over some shit and jumped on guys and started throwing punches. however, none of them ever connected cuz he had absolutely no self control or aim cuz he rocked 3 inch thick glasses on some steve urkel shit all throughout high school. not to mention he was an uncoordinated white-washed black kid who lived vicariously through lil wayne and whichever other "gangsta" rapper he was jockin at the time.<br><br>

he was the laughing stock of the school, he tried to hang out with the "popular kids" and did stupid shit for attention and they'd laugh at him and talk shit about him behind his back AND to his face. the only reason people even had him around was for their own amusement. i'm sure all of you guys know somebody like this.”</font></i></center><br>

==Marcus "Mintah" Smith==
[[Image:Piffstahs.jpg|thumb|150px|Being surrounded by white friends all day makes Piff angry]]
Like his favorite pokemon, Marcus rapidly admitted his addiction to racist, criminal behavior:

* Claiming to be off of probation, followed up with:
* Robbing White People For Weed.
* Doing Coke
* Snitching On His Neighbor's Criminal Activity
* Average weed-smoking nigger
* Being racist against Serbians
* Being racist against Jews

Anon, the protector of all that is Serbian and Jewish, decided to strike back.

==All in the Family==

Within hours, anon had performed a thorough search on Marcus and pulled up significant information.  anon requested a picture of Marcus, holding a piece of paper with "I'm sorry anon" written on it.  However, Piff put all his energy into ''Net Thug'' (VI) and refused to comply.  [http://board.rapmusic.com/audio-emcee-hook-ups/1139030-piff-you-running-out-time.html anon then issued a simple ultimatum]: Give him the picture or [http://board.rapmusic.com/audio-emcee-hook-ups/1139017-i-dont-keep-up-rm-politics-but-piff-milfhunter-common-knowledge-3.html#post16682551 his mother will be notified of his trollishness].

anon fired the salvo that made the mighty ego of Piff tremble: 
<br><br><b><i><font size="2">“I don't want to come off as strange or odd... but Marcus has been nothing but a nuisance in our Hip-Hop community. He's been banned multiple times for his outlandish aggressiveness and he continues to return with extra belligerence. We have had no choice but to notify his parent(s) of his activities. He even went as far as posting his own SSN for reasons we can't seem to figure out. ([http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:9pCFIgRIyQAJ:board.rapmusic.com/15547008-post52.html+344-86-4254&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a Availible here]) Our community has since removed the number, however, Google Cache is much slower. This posses a tremendous credit risk to your family. I hope he can have some sense knocked into him, as he is intelligent and passionate... it's just he has no basic respect for anyone or anything.

I do not mean to come at you in such difficult times for the world right now. I would just like some peace to our own little plot on the internet :D

Piff switched to his ''Victim Complex''. (MCXVI) talent and planned to [http://board.rapmusic.com/audio-emcee-hook-ups/1139017-i-dont-keep-up-rm-politics-but-piff-milfhunter-common-knowledge-3.html#post16682572 sue anon] for [[faggot|emotional distress]]. Much lulzing occurred as the big tough guy admitted to being beaten.  Just then, [http://board.rapmusic.com/audio-emcee-hook-ups/1139073-piffs-mother-responds.html Momma responded]: 
<br><br><b><i><font size="2">“Thank you for letting me know. I will address him. The SSN that is posted is not his SSN, which I am glad he wasn't stupid enough to post but still sad that he would post such information. I am new to the site and apologize for my son's idiotic behavior.

How did you find me or know I was his mother?”</font></i></b><br><br>

anon responded: 
<br><br><b><i><font size="2">“Thank you for your response. And I'll be more than happy to provide you the information you requested.

I'm usually called in whenever people need to be found. Missing alimony, bail jumpers, pending child support.... sort of an online Bounty Hunter.

His MySpace ([http://www.myspace.com/marcus.smith]) has him claiming to be 'Marcus' living in Glenview. Having such a unique name, a simple search in Google revealed a pledge that was made years ago on his behalf. ([http://gbs.glenbrook.k12.il.us/SAO/clubs/S2S/Parents2.htm Parent Pledges])

From here, a search on 123people.com showed that you were the parent in question. ([http://www.123people.com/s/geneva+mintah 123people])

He also posted from Oakton Community College with an IP we recently obtained from him. We just determined the SSN in question was not his with a confirmation search on [https://lego.oakton.edu/it/idform.php], as be posted his birthday here. ([http://board.rapmusic.com/members/milfhunter.html http://board.rapmusic.com/members/milfhunter.html]) I'm happy to hear no harm to your credit can occur because of this.

We won't pester you with constant updates of his activities, and we do apologize that it had to come to this. We've been putting up with him for two years now. Hopefully after this event, he will be more copacetic to the rules of our community.

Thanks again,

Shortly after Piff realized threats of legal intervention weren't working, [http://www.anonmedia.com/download/PiffGoesLimp.mp3 Marcus received a mysterious phone call] (4.0MB MP3), congratulating him on his achievement of Internet Fame.  (Please take note of his complete lack of bravado when Marcus found out that the Internet strikes back.)

Piff continues to play the tough guy at [[RapeMusic.com]], but these days, he keeps his distance from anon.
