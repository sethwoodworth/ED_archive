There are many ways to introduce DeviantARTs such as [http://jessennn.deviantart.com loveinavoid] (aka Jessen, real name Jessica Norris - LOLOL.) Common expressions to describe them are [[fucktard]]edly [[fuck]]tacular, and [[fuck]]ery [[fuck]] [[fuck]] [[fuck]].

Jessen transcends use of even the word [[fuck]]. Jessen is, quite simply, one of the most vain, ego-quaffing, yet singularly untalented [[idiot]]s ever to set [[fail|sail]] on the land of DeviantART. She lays claim to being a fantastic (and original) [[furry]] [[art]]ist, yet even after a glimpse at her gallery (warning: contains high amounts of [[AIDS]] and [[fail]]), one can easily tell that her art is sloppy, in some cases traced and has about as much variety as the menu at McDonald's. Furthermore, she is a [[camwhore]].

If one delves further into her deluded fantasy world, they find that she writes a [[fuck]]ton of DevianTART journal entries that read hilariously like a [[LiveJournal]] [[attention whore]]'s mad grab for affirmation. Just like any good attention whore, loveinavoid does not even care whether the attention she receives is [[hugbox|positive]] or [[rape|negative]].

As if all this [[faggot tree|faggotry]] wasn't enough to earn her a place in the [[Pyramid head|rapetime]] of our collective hearts, loveinavoid also loves to [[e]]-[[cat fight]] anybody and everybody who comes across her DeviantART page with anything other than mindless ass-patting. Of course she is as good at [[serious business|arguing on the internet]] as she is at drawing [[shit|furry art]], so she ends up looking like more of an idiot than usual.

==The Person==

Jessen is such a spectacular camwhore, that one can see as much of her as one would like in her gallery. Unfortunately for everybody on the [[internets]], Jessen is a complete un-hittable [[ugly|uggo]] and even with all the photoshop and extreme fat girl angle shots her hideous acne scars and crusty piercings still remain visible and painful to the eyes. <s>[http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/48385441/ Even blankets can't hide it.]</s> BALEETED

In fact, Jessen (who resides in [[Australia|kangaroo land]]) is so cool she happens to have an [[internet girlfriend|INTERNET GIRLFRIEND]] from Ohio. Wow, can she get any [[fail|cooler]]?

==Her [[ego]]... [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!]]==	 
[[Image:Loveinavoid copy.jpg|thumb|Pure originality!]]

As mentioned earlier, one of rapeinavoid's regular activities seems to be [[Snapesnogger|constantly getting upset over every comment]] that is not a mindless [[asspat]]. Of course she [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/11905387/408763262 pretends that] [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/11905387/408297488 she is] [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/11762970/401245813 above such] [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/49161048/408707266 things], and that the people lulzing at her [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/49161048/408850974 poorly-formed] "[[ad hominem|counter-arguments]]" are the ones who are [[Basement-dweller|somehow lacking in a life]]. [[Fail]] get!

Perhaps the best thing about her incredible lack of argumentative skills is how often she contradicts herself, and just turns into a full-blown [[hypocrite]] without any provocation. Being the [[attention whore]] that she is, she does her best to get the last word in any string of [[e]]-arguments, and still tries to pass herself off as the less-involved party.

As one DeviantARTlet asked, "<nowiki>[...]</nowiki> why do you continue to reply?" [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/49161048/408740030]

Jess Norris, never stop failing. We find your hilariously ineffectual stupidity to be a great source of lulz.

==B'awwww! Somebody dun insult mah art!==	 
 
Loveinavoid is quite an accomplished [[attention whore]] - she's not doing things half-assed! Possibly because she's [[fat]]. In any case, she is a master of taking a comment that doesn't sound like her [[hugbox]] wrote it for her, and throwing an absolute tantrum about it.

<s>[http://loveinavoid.deviantart.com/journal/11759492/ WAY TO GO, FATTY, YOU TOTALLY MISSED THE POINT.]</s> BALEETED

Oops, look at you, you just pushed aside page views as being somewhat meaningless? ([[GG]], since that is actually true) Wait I must've read that wrong, because [http://loveinavoid.deviantart.com/journal/11762970/ here you are] thanking drama for page views to try to make yourself look good.

==[[lies|i didn't copy that pichur, do you know how often this pose is used]]==	 
[[Image:Loveinavoid notcopied.jpg|thumb|lol reported. [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/49161048/407934152] ]]	 
[[Image:Loveinavoid anatomy.jpg|thumb|Try learning basic anatomy there, loveinavoid.]]	 
 
Most of loveinavoid's drama comes from the great [[lulz]] that arose when [http://sarla.deviantart.com/ somebody] noticed that a picture in loveinavoid's gallery looked suspiciously similar to [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/25546970/ some other furry's art.] When this was [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/49161048/406971756 pointed out to her,] loveinavoid went [[lol]]fully [[batshit insane]]. In the [[lollercaust]] that followed, loveinavoid posted <s>[http://loveinavoid.deviantart.com/journal/11905387/ not one] [http://loveinavoid.deviantart.com/journal/11920981/ BUT TWO]</s> (BOTH BALEETED) journal entries about how wonderful she was, and about how terrible those people were.

Like any [[furry]], the speed with which [[Godwin's Law]] was enacted was impressively comical.	 

{{Quote|i love how these 12 year old art nazis [all...two of them] accusing me of theft draw like they vomited on a piece of paper and attacked it with a stick.<br>	 
''try learning basic anatomy before you go around judging other peoples work, dears.	 
|loveinavoid}}

That's right - the girl who drew <s>[http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/39011231/ this]</s> (BALEETED) is attacking other people's anatomy. As a bonus, we get a logical fallacy as the base of an argument! Way to take two unrelated things, throw in [[Godwin's law|a Hitler remark]] and some [[lies|falsehooods]] to try to make a point! [[Zeriara]] would be proud.
