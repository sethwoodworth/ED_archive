A Master Is Out
{{Forced Meme}}

'''A Master Is Out''' is a very old [[meme]] spawned by mistranslation between [[Moonspeak]] and [[English]].  It’s origin is up for some debate because most people seem to think that every single meme ever created is from [[4chan]] and [[nobody]] else in the world could possibly make up something as retarded as this meme.  Similar to a [[roll call]] thread, it spreads quickly* and makes the viewer wonder why they go to 4chan in the first place.

==History==
[[Image:Master8.jpg|thumb|LOL]]
In the early days of 4chan, a [[Japan|Japanese]] [[Anon]] visited the site and attempted to make one of those boring, stupid, and pointless threads known as “roll call” threads.  In Japan, roll call threads are commonly accompanied with a picture depicting a [[dog]] peering out from under a cupboard; users then fill out the thread with various pictures and repeat the initial key phrase over and over again, to the amusement of the rest of the 12 year olds. 
Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your intelligence level) the Japanese Anon used a faulty translator program to render his moonspeak into English.  This gave his translation of “Where has my master gone” or “The dog is loose”  the [[Fail|botched conversion]] of "A master is out,”  and because the [[OP]] was either a moron or just plain didn’t give a shit, he posted it without checking his version.  

==Effect==

Since [[B/|/b/]] was never good, this sort of mistranslation always gets a laugh and is copied ad infinitum ([[vomit|ad nauseam]])  by the morons at 4chan until the thread maxes out, whereby another Anon will go and make a new thread.  Often the phrase "A master is out” is accompanied by various pictures that give the reader the idea that something is either gone or has escaped.  For example, a picture of [[Cthulhu]] rising from the swampy remains of a ruined and broken R’lyeh will be posted and be supplemented by the magical phrase "A master is out.”  Then everybody [[lol|will laugh.]]

==Current==

It seems a new, younger breed of /b/tard has discovered this old meme as it is currently making the rounds at 4chan once again.  By next week, or perhaps two weeks at the latest, /b/tards will grow tired of this meme and move on to something else…one can only [[hope]].
