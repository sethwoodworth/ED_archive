'''Julia Gillard''' is the 27th [and first <strike>female</strike> [[shemale]]] Prime Minister of [[Ausfalia]]. Her political stance is usually described as [[Left Wing|'moderate' left]] (although, anything looks left in comparison to her [[fundie]] political opponent Tony "The Mad Monk" <strike>Abbott</strike> Faggot. The Australian Labor Party put her into power in mid [[2010]] after they stuck a herpes infected dagger into the ass of former Prime Minister and Party Leader [[Kevin Rudd]]kips. Their obvious strategy is obvious... pull in woman voters with a female leader. This seems to have backfired, since Australian politics doesn't exactly have a sparkling track record when it comes to [[Pauline Hanson|rangas]].

Within weeks of being put into power, Julia dissolved parliament and called a federal election to see whether Ausfags want their leader to be a do-nothing whiny media whore or a [[batshit insane]] sexist [[homophobic]] religious spastic. 
[[Some argue]] that the election is completely unnecessary as Gillard will win by merit of being the (much) lesser of two evils. Although, it would appear that the people of [[Australia|Ausfailure]] were too stupid to see this, with the election too close to call, leaving the party in the hands of a bunch on unbalanced [[Retard|independents]]. Shouldn't be much different from the [[Faggotry]], [[AIDS]], and fail normally associated with politics in this redneck backwater [[Inbred]] shithole. At least I can has my FTTP now, even if the $44 Billion being spent on the [[Fail|National Broadband Network]] doesn't include provisioning for more trunks in and out of the country, effectively building a nationwide high speed lan on a dial-up connection. LOL.

One thing can be said about Julia however; publicly declaring that she [[atheist|doesn't believe in the existence of God]] shows she has more balls than 95% of the [[male]] dominated Australian political system. Obviously, she could barely win government on those credentials considering certain [[redneck|public opinion]] but the sentiment is still swell. Though despite her professed atheism she still refuses to change anything that might offend Christfags; gay marriage etc; so what exactly is the fucking point?

==Treason==

Julia Gillard has been charged with treason. [http://www.omegatimes.com/article.php?intid=1321]. Lol, who's your PM now?!

==Julia Gillard can't speak proper english==
Famous troll [[The Chaser|Andrew Hansen]] trolls Julia over her disability where she can't say properly the word <s>negosiate</s> negotiate.

==HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INTERNET==
Australia's supposed future is to finally get that '''ultra-high speed broadband internet''' that they deserve and was [[Lie|Julia's highest priority on the list of things she will bring in once she's in power]]. 

Well as of September 7th 2010, Gillard finally secured the position of Prime Minister. And as you can see the first thing that came to everyone's mind was "Where's our broadband internet?". Well here at Encyclopedia Dramatica, we believe that promises should be kept so we'll be keeping track each day whether any progress regarding broadband internet for [[Ausfailia]] will be made.
*September 8 2010 - NO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INTERNET
*September 9 2010 - STILL NO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INTERNET
*September 10 2010 - STILL NO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INTERNET

*September 13 2010 - STILL NO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INTERNET
*September 14 2010 - STILL NO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INTERNET
*September 15 2010 - STILL NO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INTERNET
*September 16 2010 - STILL NO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INTERNET
*September 17 2010 - STILL NO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INTERNET
*September 18 2010 - Julia Gillard says promises will be broken due to having a hung parliament[http://au.news.yahoo.com/election/a/-/australian-news/7968681/promises-will-be-broken-says-gillard/]. Well looks like no more High Speed Broadband Internet for Australia. BAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWW!!!

Of course it's not the first time any Labor PM has promised so much and then scrapped it all which makes you think, who the fuck keeps voting them in? '''WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU!'''
