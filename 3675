HelloISmileYou
[[Image:Attention_whore_slut.jpg|thumb|Lover of [[mudkip]]]]

[[HelloISmileYou]] you is an ex-4chan camwhore, and the target of a legendary [[7chan]] invasion. She was the creator of the "Am I ugly?" thread on 4chan. She is described as an [[emo]] and an [[attention whore]]. She has made intelligent statements such as "[[sex]] doesn't make babies" and "I'm in love. I don't NEED a STD test." She professes to be a published writer, although she hasn't accomplished anything further than some crappy internet writing. 

Let it be known that she and [[User:Logan|Logan]] have the [[:Image:Helloismileyou_cosplay.JPG|same exact red-and-black striped shirt seen in the first photo]]. The only difference is that [[User:Logan|Logan]]'s shirt is a SMALL.

==The enjoyment of Mudkipz==
On October 08, 2006, [[HelloISmileYou]] (DootDoot) was attacked by an army of her favorite thing. What's that, you ask? Well, isn't it obvious? Mudkips! She did take advantage of the situation and just sat there and enjoyed sex with the Mudkips for quite a long time. Wow, what a Mudkip whore. I bet she can't wait for the next time already to fuck up those Mudkips.

==7chan invasion==
On October 3, 2006, 7chan's /i/ initiated an attack on this carrier of internet disease. They spammed her MySpace profile and her AIM address with mudkips and aids. She apparently got pissed off and lulz ensued... She tried to retaliate and posted the following on the thread on /i/:

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">
<p>Ok, what the hell. I didn't do anything to any of you guys, yet you spam ME? The person who posted this stupidity has something against me, probably some idiot I insulted. First off, I've never had a book published, nor did I claim to have. Secondly, the "quotes" about me he put up are not true. Finally, i've never posted a picture of my self on any of the *chan's. Sorry, you guys are just playing into the OP's hands and looking like idiots.</p>

<p>Also, I CAN call the police for internet-harrasment. It is illegal you know. Whatever though, I don't really care.</p>

<p>^_^</p>
</blockquote>

==Denial of being an Emo==
HelloISmileYou has always been pointing and throwing insults at any emo's that meet her eye. What the poor attention whore doesn't know is that she is an emo herself. As seen in her MySpace, she tends to write more boring and angsty emo blogs, mostly containing complaints about how she is ugly or she can't get sex well.

==Desperate for Sex==
Quoting from a chatroom she participates everyday since she has no life: "I don't care if I get raped, I want sex." That's right p√¶dos, she is also an internet prostitute and she is hungry for sex and cyber. Feel free to IM her, she'll be waiting in a tight thong and bondage. What to fear, she will stalk boys or maybe squish them with her mutilated lips. HelloISmileYou was even desperate enough to screw a pedophile. And it is true, she masturbates to mudkips.
