OC
'''OC''' may refer to:

#[[Original content]]
#[[Owl City]]
#[[The OC]]; A shitty TV show on [[Old media|FOX]] based on the [[IRL]] California county known for being the state capital of [[anti-lulz]] and full of white Republican [[NORPs]]. The main plot deals with [[drama]]tized events about its huge population of [[Waaaambulance|whiny]], spoiled [[angsty teen]]s. Popular among [[16 year old girls]] and [[gay boys]].
# [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder]]
#An [[original character]]. Usually created in fan fiction to make the writers wet dreams come true in the form of fucking every female character in the story. But then again, you could NOT fuck up and write a decent story with an OC. But that's like [[TFO]] trying straight sex, it isn't gonna happen unless you booze him up.
#[[Oxycontin]], the best recreational drug known to man (and occasionally, known to women, amirite?)
#"Open carry": The practice of openly carrying a firearm, especially one secured in a holster on one's hips.  Open carry is legal in many states, even without a license, but some pussy states that [[Why_do_you_hate_freedom?|hate freedom]] outlaw the practice.  In some places, openly carrying a firearm in public is a great way to troll police officers.  They might try to [[Banned_IRL|IRL B&]] you, but if you're prepared and lucky, you might be able to sue them and win damages for violating your civil rights.
