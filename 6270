Parody account
A [[LiveJournal]] '''parody account''' is a popular method of [[troll]]ing, whereby one [[user]] creates an account where the name is almost identical to another user or [[community]]. The purpose of this is to satirize this person, usually aided by [[serial adding]] and/or [[comment]]ing in as many other people's journals as possible. Many [[lulz]] can be had in this way, by impersonating [[moderator|mods]] and threatening [[lusers|users]] with the [[banhammer]].

Parody accounts will generally be [[suspended]] within a few hours of their creation, due to the fairly obvious [[fact]] that their purpose is to harass.
