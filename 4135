'''Yoav "Isarig" Sarig''' is a revert henchman and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Isarig sockpuppeteer] for the [[Wikipedia Jews]], a close ally of [[SlimVirgin]] and [[Jayjg]]. He is alternatively known as the Jewish "KAMIKAZE EDIT WARRIOR."  He is well-known for ''miraculously'' appearing on Israel-related articles any time Wikipedia's pro-Israel lobby has exhausted their Three-revert Rule limit.  He was recruited to Wikipedia by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbara_Fellowships Hasbara Fellowships] and is currently paid 5 shekels an hour for his expert sockpuppet work defending Israel's foreign policy, especially the practice of home demolition.

Notable aliases include:
* WJBscribe blocked "'''Clintonesque'''" with an expiry time of indefinite ‎ (checkuser confirmed sockpuppet of User:Isarig). This user is a sockpuppet of Isarig, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Clintonesque and has been blocked indefinitely].
* MastCell blocked "'''Teens!'''" with an expiry time of indefinite ‎(Abusing multiple accounts: sockpuppet of User:Isarig, checkuser-proven). This user is a sockpuppet of Isarig, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&page=User:Teens! and has been blocked indefinitely].

Why, you might ask, has the virulently anti-sockpuppet Wikipedia not perma-banned such a pervasive sockpuppeteer? Perhaps it has something to do with Isarig's real-life status.

Media-famous edits-for-hire businessman [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16793247/ Greg Kohs] just [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=12295 let the cat out the bag] on one of the greatest [[Wikipedia Jews]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Sarig Yoav Sarig] is an [http://www.agri.gov.il/People/YoavSarig.html Israeli agricultural engineer] who holds several patents for mechanical apparatus for harvesting and processing of jojoba beans, pecan nuts and pomegranates. How a wealthy businessman spends all day sitting on ass fighting a propaganda war on Wikipedia instead of managing his assets [[it is a mystery|is a mystery]]. Kohs claims he and Isarig had phone calls about [[hookers and blow|"money and wikis,"]] but Isarig [[lie|didn't specifically offer Kohs any money to edit]].

{{quote|Hey Isarig, If you have a chance, would you mind e-mailing me? [[Jayjg]] 22:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)|Jayjg to Isarig|Wikipedia}}
To suggest that Isarig and Jayjg [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Isarig&diff=prev&oldid=68704251 collaborate their Israeli Wikipedia mission off-site via email or IRC] would be ANTI-SEMITIC and PREPOSTEROUS!

Isarig rose in power in the Wikipedia cabal until when Jayjg went on wikibreak for half of 2007. Shortly afterward, with no Jayjg to protect him, Isarig and all his socks were banned.  Once Jayjg returned, Isarig was mysteriously unbanned and continued editing until mysteriously committing [[an hero|wikicide]] on January 13, 2008.
