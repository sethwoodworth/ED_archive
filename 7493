Shoutwire is the number one source of [[idiot|moonbattery]] on the [[Internets]]. Any resemblance to [[Digg]] and [[StumbleUpon]] is purely obvious.

Shoutwire is a hangout for slackers, batshit [[insane]] [[conspiracy]] [[liberals|nuts]], and [[basement dwelling]] [[nerds]].

Originating [[at least 100|circa 1950]], Shoutwire was started as a place where social drop-outs and [[Special:Listusers/sysop|wannabe journalists]] could post their Casablanca movie review and wait for the mountains of praise from fellow reviewers. Of course, the praise never came, due mostly to the fact that no one gives a shit about the fact that "Play it again, Sam" wasn't actually in the movie.

Shortly thereafter, some [[hentai]] [[fanboys]] crashed some airships into big block looking things, achieving massive damage and [[lulz]] aplenty. Shoutwire users, like vultures ripping apart a dead hooker, descended upon the subjects of  [[JEWS DID WTC|9/11]], [[politics]], [[conspiracy]], and the ever popular [[Mecha-Hitler]]/[[Ronald Reagan]] [[paris hilton|sex tape scandal.]]

After contributing posts on literally every possible topic that could be written about [[WTF|within the confines of the 10 dimensions]], these [[Brian Peppers]] clones somehow manage to keep rewording their boring old shit, and posting it again. Forever.

[[Last Thursday|Most recently]], Shoutwire has been [[butthurt|accused]] of [[racist|racism.]] [http://forums.digitalpoint.com/showthread.php?t=55359]

It should be noted that Shoutwire is not racist to only [[Niggers|Niggers]] but to dirty [[jews]], Mexicans, Chinamen, and Australians. However it is quite odd that the typical Shoutwire user will jump to the defense of your average Arab. 


Recently, everyone realized that this shit [[shit nobody cares about|sucks]]. There was a website challenge by the extremely [[retarded|capable]] site [[admin|administrators]] to see if anyone had the guts to build an even shittier website.  The contest was one by user MrBig4545 when he created: www.thisaintnews.com
