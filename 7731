'''Speedycat''' originated from the EBaum's World chatroom from "Speedchat" or "Speedychat", a term used to describe excess spamming in the chatroom, or people generally typing too fast at the same time, and the badly sung song "Speedycat" from the Beatmania IIDX series which happens to be entirely in [[Engrish]].

From this, an idea to draw a new [[cat]] [[meme]] for [[4chan]] was put forwards. However, one member decided to take this idea further and created a short looping [[Flash]] animation involving a bright yellow cat flying across the night sky with the song "Speedycat" playing in the background. Upon clicking the [[moon]] the cat would hit "Warp Speed" in which the cat would be seen flying through bright flashing lights to a sped up version of "Speedycat".


Thus the new [[cat]] [[meme]] Speedycat was born in the late months of the year [[2005]] and is known to be ''"Splendid Like a Fire"''. As to the phrase ''"[[longcat]] is looooooong"'' Speedycat herself has the phrase ''"speedycat sure is [[criteria for speedy deletion|speeeeeeeedy]]"''.
