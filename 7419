'''Shane Halligan''' became [[an hero]] at age 16 in 2006. He stole his father's AK-47 and brought it to school that morning in a gym bag along with [[gay]] muscle porno. He fired the rifle into the wall a few times to cause mega[[lulz]], then put the muzzle to his chin and became an hero.

Unfortunately, he didn't do a [[Virginia Tech massacre|Cho]], as he wasn't lulzy enough to shoot any students.

Halligan volunteered as a junior firefighter and always wanted to be one of those firemen who slides down the greased pole, but in December of 2006 he realized that he was a [[fail]]ure and committed suicide.

Shane's friends, like all other friends of heroes, rant about their hero:
