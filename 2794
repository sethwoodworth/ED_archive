FT2
'''FT2''' is a [[Britfag]] [[Wikipedia]] [[bureaucratic fuck|admin]] and [[Arbitrator]] who practices [[Nigger manual|Neuro-linguistic programming]], a pseudoscience nonsense approach to psychology. He is also sympathetic to zoophilia, believing it allows increased empathy to animals. He is also a part of the secret police of Wikipedia known as the checkusers and [[oversight]]ers.

Super-sleuth Daniel Brandt [http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/hivemind.html#338 claims] that he is <big>'''Paul Sinclair'''</big>, a close friend of [[David Gerard]]. If true, that would explain a lot.

==Love of Animals==
FT2 loves animals. A lot. In fact, he loves them to the point of fucking them.

In order to unfairly aid FT2’s 2007 [[ArbCom]] election, David Gerard oversighted two edits made by FT2 on July 11, 2004 (diffs are 4559833 and 4557792), that exposed FT2’s zoophilia. If they had not been oversighted, FT2 would ‎never have been elected to ArbCom. David Gerard banned some poor faggot called Giano II for bringing this to light. Fred Bauder confirmed that this was true [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano_II&diff=prev&oldid=253847411 here]. The two edits in question were to the [[Wikipedia:Zoophilia|Zoophilia]] article. The edit summary for one was "Addition of section: Zoophilia as a lifestyle (draft v1)" and the edit summary for the other one was "added &quot;dogsex&quot; to &quot;farmsex&quot;, being the two terms commonly used in pornography" ([http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=r_7krLEiThNhWAbQHaVSlvA&hl=en Entries 55 and 56]).

Other edits made by FT2 are also found to have been oversighted. Several of these were when he erased edits made by his own IP address, 87.127.119.101, because he doesn't want [[you]] to know [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Paul+Sinclair%2C+age+42%2C+of+Sinclair+Associates+%2840+South+Street%2C+Corsham%2C+Wiltshire%2C+England%29&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&oq=&aqi= where he lives] ([http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=r_7krLEiThNhWAbQHaVSlvA&hl=en Entries 1029, 1030, 1170]). Apparently, his business is located in Wiltshire, England, but he lives in Cardiff, Wales (there are plenty of [[goat]]s in Wales).
