K-line
A '''k-line''' (aka "kill") is the penultimate [[IRC]] [[ban]], booting a user from an entire IRC server.  K-lines are only a half-step under the dreaded G-line (Global-line) ban, which bans you from the entire network, and one can only assume it was named K-line because the [[nerd]] that wrote IRC was seriously [[dyslexia|dyslexic]]. 
([[Harry Potter|Spoilers:]] K-Line = "Kill Line". G-Line = Global Kill Line)

K-lines are only passed out by the IRC server's operators (called IRCops), but they are generally too busy eating donuts at the IRCoffeeShop, or playing #MW2 in their IRCondo to really police the place the way that a website's message board moderators do.  Essentially, unlike [[perma-ban]]s, it's impossible to say something so [[Jews_did_WTC|stupid]], [[God_hates_fags|inflamitory]], or [[bitchdyke|spiteful]] that the IRCops will ever notice you.  In order to actually get them to IRCapYoAss, you have to do something extraordinarily trollish (even for IRC), like DCC [[spam]] the IRCops personally with [[furry]] porn or [[Denial_of_Service|dDoS]] the network, or be from a foreign country!

Since anyone can change their ident on [[IRC]] to escape a lazy IRCop's k-line (or change their IP, if their ISP has dynamic IP adresses), many resort to simply k-lining entire ISPs, like [[AOL]] or entire countries.  This is because IRCops are too fucking stupid to just use a type 2 banmask (*!*@some.cawk.shit.4chan.org), thinking that they can show off their [[1337]] IRC skills to their [[Fag|fuckbuddies]] and improve their e-penis by using an ident ban. I mean, I'm pretty sure every single person in [[America|Brazil]] was in on that [[DOS]] attack, anyway!

If you have k-line abilities on [[bantown]], make sure you k-line [[User:JViz|JViz]] as much as possible.

== Mass Kill's ==

A mass kill is when a raged oper just says 'fuck it' and bans most of or an entire room. Mass kills are common on [[Penis Pump|EFnet]]. [[Rob Levin|Freenode]] and [[Weeaboo|Rizon]] have them but much less often.
