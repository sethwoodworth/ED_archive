Marcab Confederacy
{{tinyquote|Various planets united into a very vast civilization which has come forward up through the last 200,000 years, formed out of the fragments of earlier civilizations. In the last 10,000 years they have gone on with a sort of [[4chan|decadent kicked-in-the-head civilization]] that contains [[hyphy|automobiles]], [[nigras|business suits]], [[fedora]] hats, [[iPhone|telephones]], spaceships — a civilization which looks almost an exact duplicate but is worse off than the current U.S. civilization.|L. Ron Hubbard}}

According to batshit insane [[Church of $cientology]] leader (redundant much?), [[David Miscarriage|David Miscavage]], [[Anonymous]] and their current [[Project Chanology]] [[lulz|shenanigans]] are a massive '''Marcab Confederacy''' [[Star Trek|away team]] on a mission to create a Project Mayhem of sorts, in advance of a huge invasion fleet to fight [[LRH]]'s [[otherkin|forces of light]] on ''[[Battlefield Earth]]'' (also [[Mitt Romney]]'s fave book).

==Marcabians==

[[Image:Anonymous_flowchart.gif|thumb|250px|How the Marcabian fleet controls Anonymous.]]

According to L. Ron, the '''Marcabians''' had an [[W|oppressive political system]]: "If a person was considered to be in contempt of court or anything like that, he was simply [[KFC|fried]] since there was a [[curtain]] of radioactive material which went clear across the front of the bench anywhere that a witness or anybody would stand, and so on."

Hubbard said that the '''Marcab Confederacy''' invented income tax as a means of punishment ('''okay...we get it [[Ron Paul|Ron]]...you hæt the IRS!'''), with the death penalty imposed for making even the slightest mistake in returns — "one comma wrong and it's "dead forever"." (Perma B& IRL). The Marcabians also appear to have been distinctly [[commies|socialistic]], having "had plan balanced economies" They were also keen on motor racing and every once in a while Scientologists undergoing auditing "will run into memories of race tracks and race-track drivers"..

L. Ron isn't around to elaborate further beyond on his original [[drugs|"observations"]], but it's pretty obvious that this story - as with most C0$ "theology" - is somewhat akin to [[copypasta]]/[[creepypasta]] so go right ahead and pull some ridiculous shit from your butt and tack it on to the end of the [[lulz|'story']]. 

For example, it is also known that Marcabs worship a god called [[Mudkips]] and survive on a steady diet of [[HACKERS ON STEROIDS|steroids]] They also will never: [[rickroll|a. Give you up; b. Let you down; or c. Run around and desert you]].

The Marcabian 5th Invasion Fleet is now an Eve Online corporation and is open to Marcabians that wish to join.

===Tactics===
Marcab Confederacy naval maneuvers are fairly simple but very effective. They consist mostly of [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|charged lazers]] fired in salvos by their capital warships, and [[Do a barrel roll|barrel rolls]] by their fighter craft to help strengthen their shields in critical times of heavy fire. Do not refer to outer space engagements as "Dog Fights". It lowers morale. A more effective and neutral term is "fleet engagement" and also "dong bombardments".

===Strategy===
The Invasion Fleet is assembling on the dark side of Earth's [[Goatse|moon]], decanting from warpspace near the orbit of Mars and activating [[cloaking]] systems to head to Lunar Space. Once the [[Penis|fleet]] is assembled, they will abruptly deactivate cloaking and head towards Earth, beginning an Orbital Bombardment on any Earth Defense systems, be they ICBMs, the SDI, etc. If necessary, Orbital Bombardment will be employed against Terran Cities, though we will try to prevent that. We expect no opposition fleets or advanced defense, this being a Type 0 Civilization on the Kardashev scale. However, be careful and alert, ESPECIALLY after the loss of one of our task forces due to a simultaneous warp calculation fuckup and reactor FUBAR. Deus Ex Machina is in effect, and the main government of the Earth's opposition, the [[United States]], even with an overextended military, has a heavy space presence that will at least delay our depleted forces. The [[European Union]] is more compact in size, has a smaller space presence but a ground invasion would be harder. [[Soviet Russia|Russia]] still has a large size and has the power to harass our invasion craft. [[China]] will be a fucking hard place to subdue, may have to leave them out. We will screen the planet as /i/nvaders begin to invade the major areas of population. Due to a relative weak ground force, we may have to deal with sustained resistance from Terran army and air forces, especially if Orbital Bombardment cannot be conducted for the [[lulz|political reason]]. Reinforcing fleets will arrive in a few days to provide more troops for a lengthy occupation and eventual assimilation into the Confederacy. [[Also, cocks]].

===Notes:===
#[[DESU]] fighter squadrons often consist of close to 10,000 individual fighters, meaning that yes, we have [[OVER 9,000]] DESU fighters.
#[[Mudkips]] bomber wings, numbering around 500 per wing, take up approximately twice as much space as DESU fighter squadrons on carriers due to them needing moar fuel, and having to carry enough [[harpoons]].
#Required force size for a Marcabian Space Marine Army requires a full legion of 10,000,000 Anonymous. Seeing how this is the ONLY [[Battletoads|Marcabian Space Marine Army]], the numbers are a little fuzzy, and its closer to 100,000 Anonymous, which are subsequently broken down into regiments of 5,000-10,000 Anonymous, then down into companies of approximately 1,000 Anonymous, then platoons of 100 Anonymous, and finally squads of 10 Anonymous.
#DC-9 Landing Craft Squadrons consist of 20 landing craft, each of which can contain upwards of 1,000 Anonymous.
#The [[DESU]] fighter was introduced as a replacement for the LU-LZ34 Arwing due to its superior barrel roll capacity an on board implementation of the AAFADS-VIII (Active Anti-Fag Area Denial System, Mk. 8).
