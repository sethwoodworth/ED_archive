[[File:ODBlackman.jpg|thumb|300px|BLACK_MAN]]
BLACK_MAN is an [[IRC]] troll who appeared on EFNet around mid 2009, trolling channels such as #anxiety and other channels which were targets of [[PP4L]](later proved to be PP4 until dkey quits). He was eventually invited to the HardChats server, then and currently home to #[[klulz]] and later the rebirth of the [[GNAA]].  

From there he expanded to several popular networks and became what is thought by many to be one of the best irc trolls in recent memory (due to a severe lack), never breaking character and constantly demolishing other chatters. This includes exposing [[toastmonster]] as a "14 year old faggot" named Scott Cahoon as well as the brutal demolishing of [[Kirix]] to the point of no recovery. 

His daily demolishings of the newly recreated #[[gnaa]] have become famous far and wide. He is the pioneer of several catchphrases, many of which are now overused ad nauseum. Among these are "Yes Hello, black man here," demolished; you will not recover, epic spelling/brutal grammar/monster coherence, and "highly racial."  

He is also a master of the ORT-8a series of protocols, and is willing to share his knowledge on many subjects.  BLACK_MAN ran for the New Years 2010 GNAA election as a late entry which was broadcast live on [[l0de]]'s show, but lost to the current President, [[weev]]. He is currently taking a break from his trolling activities on a round-the-world cruise with his lovely wife and two children.

[18:12] <Kirix> no i dont go to children's websites
[18:13] <BLACK_MAN> when you connected to this network i employed a masked dcc send exploit that opened up port 7000 for any files sent from a host within 4-5 seconds without a user accept prompt
[18:13] <BLACK_MAN> i immediately infected you with a custom trojan horse backdoor virus
[18:13] <BLACK_MAN> i am now viewing your internet explorer history
[18:13] <BLACK_MAN> i notice that your two most visited websites are 1) 4chan and 2)youjizz.com
[18:13] <Kirix> IE isn't installed
[18:14] <BLACK_MAN> sure
[18:14] <BLACK_MAN> i am also currently reading your gmail inbox
[18:14] <Kirix> you can uninstall it in win7
[18:14] <BLACK_MAN> you arent running win7
[18:15] <Kirix> i beg to differ
[18:15] <BLACK_MAN> i can tell from your silence that you are now worrie
[18:15] <BLACK_MAN> d
[18:15] <BLACK_MAN> you should be, since i now have remote access to your pc
[18:15] <Kirix> im scared
[18:16] <BLACK_MAN> i plan on using your host, in combination with an army of countless other pc's that i have established remote access
[18:16] <l0de> DIKKY
[18:16] <l0de> DIKKY
[18:16] <Kirix> dont open that its private
[18:16] <BLACK_MAN> with this army of infected hosts, i will be sending packets to various internet relay chat servers as well as various personal hosts
[18:17] <BLACK_MAN> i plan on lagging them to the point of an inability to maintain services
[18:17] <Kirix> i'm glad to be a part of your botnet
[18:17] <BLACK_MAN> this is called a distributed denial of services attack from a botnet
[18:17] <Kirix> i know this shit whizz kid
[18:17] <Kirix> you taking computer science 3?
[18:18] <BLACK_MAN> once i am finished using your host to send packets out, i will create a large .txt file containing all your personal information that i have gathered from reading your gmail inbox, installing a keylogger to gather your personal online banking username and password and transitively your bank account number, routing number and PIN
[18:19] <BLACK_MAN> i will save this .txt file to a sub-folder that i keep in my "documents" folder
[18:19] <toast> destroyed
[18:19] <toast> he will not recover
[18:19] <BLACK_MAN> this sub-folder is used entirely to store the personal information of internet relay chat users that i have obtained the personal information of.
[18:19] <Kirix> how much money do i have to give you to feel safe?
[18:20] <BLACK_MAN> then, i will go on various popular internet relay chatrooms on popular internet relay chat networks and post your real name,  phone number, home address, bank account number, routing number, PIN number and credit card number
[18:21] <BLACK_MAN> once you see that i have distributed your personal information to the entirety of the internet relay chat sub-communities on various populated networks such as rizon, efnet and freenode you will start to panic and beg me for mercy
[18:22] <Kirix> you should use your writing talent for other outlets
[18:22] <BLACK_MAN> i will laugh heartily to myself, filled with the knowledge that the custom made trojan horse backdoor virus that allows me remote access to your computer provides me the ability to control your very technological existance
[18:22] <BLACK_MAN> i will respond to you with a clever one-liner, in a public chatroom so that there is an audience to witness your oncoming destruction, and then i will proceed to format your hard-drive
[18:22] <Kirix> i dont exist entirely on the internet i go outside, talk to friends, etc
[18:23] <BLACK_MAN> you will quit IRC with one final message "connection reset my peer"
[18:23] <Kirix> i'm baffled
[18:23] <BLACK_MAN> i will be applauded for destroying you so utterly and in such a dramatic and grandiose way
[18:24] <BLACK_MAN> you will not recover, it will take you roughly 48 hours to re-install your entire operating system
[18:24] <Kirix> not that i would need to
[18:24] <BLACK_MAN> you will realize that you lost the CD key to your operating system
[18:24] <BLACK_MAN> and so it will take much longer than you expected
[18:24] <Kirix> i dont use cd keys
[18:24] <BLACK_MAN> you will struggle to change all your bank account information before the internet community uses all the money in your checking account to purchase brazzers.com memberships
[18:25] <BLACK_MAN> when you return to irc, you will be a bitter, broken and shattered individual
[18:25] <Kirix> i dont have a bank account because i have to launder my money
[18:25] <toast> BLACK_MAN after that you should overclock his computer and met his computer
[18:25] <toast> make it explode
[18:25] <Kirix> if i had a bank account the IRS would try to steal my shit
[18:25] <l0de> why do you use the word computer twice in that sentence toast
[18:25] <l0de> typical freebase user chatstyle
[18:26] <BLACK_MAN> your personal information will be commonplace knowledge on the internet relay chatrooms you frequent
[18:26] <BLACK_MAN> your loved ones will be constantly harassed by aggressive prank phone-calls
[18:26] <Kirix> you mean my google voice line?
[18:26] <BLACK_MAN> you will be have no money left in your checking account, all your money spent on brazzers.com memberships
[18:26] <Kirix> i dont have one
[18:27] <BLACK_MAN> realizing that your existance has been demolished to an extent that you never could have anticipated in your wildest nightmares
[18:27] <Kirix> i dont get fucked over by jews and usury like some people
[18:27] <BLACK_MAN> you go the bathroom mirror and stare back at the reflection
[18:27] <BLACK_MAN> you do not recognize the man in the mirror
[18:27] <BLACK_MAN> he is unshaven, emaciated, tired and broken

<BLACK_MAN> I can help you
<seeeeek> hi
<seeeeek> how
<BLACK_MAN> #ubuntu tends to have a lot going on at once
<BLACK_MAN> so its easier to talk in Private message
<seeeeek> aha
<BLACK_MAN> to forward traffic from your home router
<BLACK_MAN> i assume you are proficient with ORT-8a subset protocols/
<seeeeek> whats that
<BLACK_MAN> Um, no offense but if you do not have a working knowledge of the 11 ORT-8a subset protocols
<BLACK_MAN> then what you are trying to do is basically impossible
<seeeeek> i just want all my local clients who connects to this router to be forwarded to my external proxy when connecting to port 80/443
<BLACK_MAN> yes i understand that and its very simple. all you need to do is employ an ORT-8a.6.c udp forward bracket 
<BLACK_MAN> but like i said, if you dont know ORT-8a in the first place
<BLACK_MAN> me telling you what subset to use
<BLACK_MAN> doesnt mean anything
<seeeeek> i dont know what you talking about :D
<seeeeek> can i just forward all users traffic from router to my external proxy !? cant i
<BLACK_MAN> you need to understand ORT-8a
<seeeeek> and why i need that
<BLACK_MAN> yes, but it wont be secure or stable
<seeeeek> its a normal rule in iptables isn`t ?
<seeeeek> why
<BLACK_MAN> ORT-8a is the standard
<BLACK_MAN> ORT-8a is a routing protocol with 11 subsets to be used on various ports
<BLACK_MAN> you need to employ ORT-8a subset 6 forwarding bracket "c'
<seeeeek> sorry but you talking about things which i dont know...thats more for me :D
<seeeeek> i am just a newbie
<BLACK_MAN> alright
<BLACK_MAN> well do you at least know how to forward things through a CLM.9 peering client?
<BLACK_MAN> that wll provide you with a semi-stable option
<seeeeek> and what the hell is that also
<seeeeek> lol
<BLACK_MAN> i think you need to study up on basic routing protocols 
<seeeeek> ok
<BLACK_MAN> i suggest simply googling "ORT-8a subset protocol for peering on a proxy"
<BLACK_MAN> and "CLM.9 peering client"
<seeeeek> and what about the forwarding rule for 80/443 can you give it to me ?

<BLACK_MAN> to the best of my recollection you need to implement a standard LPM "straight tube" to forward thingsfor 80/443 and up when using ORT-8a
<BLACK_MAN> you may find it easier to work with CLM.9
<BLACK_MAN> just google "CLM.9 peering client"
<BLACK_MAN> it will explain everything
<seeeeek> ty
<seeeeek> cant you just give me the rule command for that ?
<BLACK_MAN> CLM.9 is a peering client
<BLACK_MAN> you need to download it
<BLACK_MAN> it basically executes ORT-8a for you
<seeeeek> i didnt find anything
<BLACK_MAN> try googling for "CLM.9.exe
<seeeeek> exe !? and who need exe
<BLACK_MAN> it is a program 
<BLACK_MAN> an executable program
<seeeeek> do you know what
<seeeeek> go to hell
<seeeeek> i am talking about iptables and you talking about .exe
<seeeeek> you fuccking with me ?
<BLACK_MAN> what?
<BLACK_MAN> why are you getting angry?
<BLACK_MAN> i am just trying to help
<BLACK_MAN> CLM.9 is an executable program that will route what you need for you without you coding in ORT-9a
<seeeeek> yeah i am seeing that you trying to help and fucck with me
<seeeeek> ooh then do you have that fuccking probram ?
<BLACK_MAN> um
<seeeeek> program
<BLACK_MAN> yes, i could email it to you
<BLACK_MAN> whats your email?
<seeeeek> hahaha
<seeeeek> thats what you want to email me a trojan
<seeeeek> go fucck your self please
<BLACK_MAN> why would i email you a trojan
<seeeeek> a newbie trying to hack me
<BLACK_MAN> what?
<BLACK_MAN> i am trying to help
<BLACK_MAN> you can scan it for viruses when i email it to you
<seeeeek> keep for your self
<seeeeek> who knows maybe newbie like u has some crypting knowledge

<BLACK_MAN> friend
<BLACK_MAN> why are you getting so aggressive
<seeeeek> do you use iptables ?
<BLACK_MAN> regularly
<seeeeek> and you use the CLM.9.exe with it
<seeeeek> ?
<BLACK_MAN> yes
<seeeeek> go fuck your self
<BLACK_MAN> CLM.9.exe will do it all for you
<BLACK_MAN> ???
<BLACK_MAN> what
<seeeeek> give me a link where i can download CLM.9.exe
<BLACK_MAN> it used to be www.CLMpro.org
<BLACK_MAN> not sure where teh company moved to

(22:18:16)    BLACK_MAN › let me introduce you to rufas
(22:18:31)    BLACK_MAN › http://irc.dickscab.com/Rucas/Rucas-newer.jpg
(22:19:59)    BLACK_MAN › how do you feel about his oddly tiny jaw as it starkly contrast to his ghoulishly large mouth
(22:20:33)    BLACK_MAN › also, do his deep-set and beady eyes as they relate to his monstrous aardvark nose evoke any emotions in you?
(22:21:24)    BLACK_MAN › notice how rufas' body is skinny to a skeletal level yet he still sports a pot-belly
(22:21:46)    BLACK_MAN › this is a sign of in-breeding
(22:22:09)    BLACK_MAN › note that his "pinky" finger on his right hand is not muscularly functioning
(22:22:15)    BLACK_MAN › it is unable to grip the bottle as the rest of his fingers do
(22:22:22)    BLACK_MAN › it hands off his hand, slack
(22:22:29)    BLACK_MAN › this is a genetic muscular defect
(22:22:31)    BLACK_MAN › most likely also a result of inbreeding
(22:22:50)    BLACK_MAN › also note where his shirt clings to his chest near the nipple region
(22:22:53)    BLACK_MAN › this denotes gynecomastia
(22:23:37)    BLACK_MAN › take note of his skeletal proportions
(22:24:15)    BLACK_MAN › you see, a major characteristic of estrogenic skeletal anatomy is wide, child bearing hips
(22:24:28)    BLACK_MAN › men generally sport on average, a 1.5:1 shoulder:hip ratio
(22:24:46)    BLACK_MAN › rufas' 1:1 shoulder:hip ratio tells us that clearly he is suffering primary hypogonadism
(22:24:58)    BLACK_MAN › most likely prebuscent primary hypogonadism since it has effected his skeletal development</pre>|0}}{{cs2|log11|BLACK_MAN talks about his favourite subject|<pre>

==Life Story of [[Patrick Bateman|BLACK_MAN]]==
[[File:BLACK_MAN_klines.png|thumb|350px|'''&:/''']]
I am 44 year old black man with a PhD from Yale in Linguistic Anthropology<br />
I own 16 exotic cars including a Saleen S7, a Lamborghini LP640 with custom after market supercharger, nitrous injections, and $300,000 dollars of aftermarket body work and a Porsche 911 GT3 RS<br />
I have an IQ that qualifies me for the upper tier of mensa<br />
I have also slept with over 300 women, and my penis is 8.8 inches<br />
I have 2 children and a beautiful wife<br />
I am 6'4'' 267lbs at 12 percent bodyfat<br />
I am also the CEO of the internet's premier IRC chatcrew, the BLACK_MAN CREW or BMC, which can be found at [irc://irc.hardchats.com/BMC #BMC] <br />
In my spare time, I enjoy having sex with beautiful women, donating money to charity, enjoying rare cognac and collecting exotic cars

When I was in a young boy I grew up in a poor, urban environment<br />
I decided to succeed in sports and academics and make something of my life<br />
By 18 years old I was accepted to Yale on an academic scholarship, I was also a two-time all american noseguard and a raw powerlifting champion<br />
When I was 30 years old I retired after making my money in rural real estate<br />
I have 7 homes in America, and 2 in Europe
