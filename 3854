The ''i''Drama suite is the most complete set of applications for [[lulz]] generation and archival. The main components of the ''i''Drama suite include:

*[[Encyclopediadramatica|Encyclopedia Dramatica]]
*[[LJDrama]].org
*[[Frienditto]]
*[[Ghettoditto]]
*[[Narcopolo]]
*[[AudioLJ]]
*[[Anonymuncule]]
*The malevolent AI known only as [[jameth]].

There occasionally pop up alternatives to the ''i''Drama suite which claim moral superiority for not being affiliated with the unstoppable ''i''Drama machine. Like [[Linux]] zealots, these people are clueless [[retard]]s. Everyone knows that ''i''Drama delivers the most lulz at far less total cost of lulzership than any open-lulz alternative.
