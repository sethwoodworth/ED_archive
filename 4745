Not to be confused with [[basement-dweller|Gary the Fable Guy]], '''Daniel Lawrence Whitney''', is a [[redneck]] [[Americunt]] stand-up "comedian" and [[liar|actor]]. He is one of the co-stars of the [[redneck|Blue Collar Comedy Tour]], a group of "comedians" who wouldn't know what funny was if it raped them in the ear. These other comedians in the troupe merely leech off of Larry's hard-earned success, with the exception of Jeff Foxworthy, who is the working-class white male's answer to [[Bill Cosby|Bill Cosby]]. He also is known for his [[retard|superb acting]], most notably in the movies [[Muslim|Delta Farce]] and [[GRIDS|Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector]]. Despite his acting abilities, Larry cannot hide his non-Southern [[Nebraska|roots]], and has been rumored to enjoy partaking in some quite exotic [[hookers_and_blow|activities]]. Also note that Larry only got his job for [[blowjob|blowing]] Jeff Foxworthy.

==Early life==
Larry The Cable Guy spent his early childhood in a small closet.  His father Tom Sr. was a minister at the Four Mile Church - you do the math.  After a brief run-in with the law, he returned to Kenya.  Larry was mostly raised by his white grandmother in Hawaii.  Larry is a tremendous University of Nebraska [[football]] fan and can be seen regularly on the sidelines at their games, fingering the [[Power_Rangers|male cheerleaders]].  When asked why he was a Nebraska fan, he replied

==Career==
Is evidence of [[Satan]], as there is no other explanation for his [[Attention_whore|fame]] and [[fail|success]].
On another note, it could be evidence that Jeff Foxworthy is likewise a deity and that for fame all one must do is suck his mustached cock.  

After closing this show at Laff-Laff's Chuckle Hut, Daniel entered the hospital with a [[Aids|mysterious fever]].  After three days of observation with no diagnosis, the fever began to subside.  This sudden affliction left him scarred with a [[ENGLISH_MOTHERFUCKER_DO_YOU_SPEAK_IT|southern accent]].  The video below documents his original vocal style.  Note the prominent lack of [[lulz]], even pre-fever.

==Political Affiliations==
[[Image:Larry-the-gay-nazi.jpg|thumb|Git-r-heil.]]
Larry is a member in good standing in the Disney chapter of Gay Nazis.  Perks include (but are not limited to) uninhibited sex with any [[shota|pre-pubescent]] boy of his choosing, the ability to warp the minds of Americans into believing a catch phrase first uttered by a scientologist is amazing, and, of course, he can restart [[Lie|the holocaust]] any time. (We're all rooting for you on that front Larry!)

==Git-R-Done and Other Catchphrases==
Larry the Cable Guy uses [[Not_funny|catchphrase humor]], including "Git-R-Done," "[[Rape|Lord, I apologize]]," "I don't care who you are that's funny right there," and "Whoa, who let the newfag in?". The popularity of the phrase "Git-R-Done" can be traced to white middle-class suburbia (is there another kind?) and lower-class city dwellers use in expressing an imaginary connection with the country or cowboy lifestyles. Most often used in reference to a task, since it is a take on "get her done," meaning to finish a [[job]].

Often heard before lynchings and keg-stands, the etymology can be traced to the film "Carrie", the lines muttered by Scientology nut [[John_Travolta|John Travolta]] just before they kill the pigs. 
The use of this catch phrase usually prefaces a complete tranformation into a cockgobbling 13 year old boy intent on spreading his faggotry to the masses.  Unfortunately for the rest of us, other side-effects do not include death by gang rape.

The "Git-R-Done" phrase is also used by a large percentage of [[13 year old boys]] who think it's funny.  This automatically makes that person a [[douchebag]].

He also uses the phrase "I don't care who you are that's funny right there" to let people know that they are [[smart|stupid]] if they think one of his jokes are offensive rather than [[unfunny|hilarious]].  Clearly he uses this one ''a lot''.

==Love Notes From David Cross==
{{quote|Think-Of-Something-To-Do-And-See-That-Task-To-Completion!!!!!|David Cross, ''Jew''}}

Whitney wrote a [http://www.amazon.com/Git-Done-Larry-Cable-Guy/dp/0307237427 book] [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|"chock-full of fart jokes and straight talk about America,"]] which spent the second chapter [[Masturbate|entertaining]] rednecks at the expense of [[Homosexual|"liberals"]] and specifically, Cross.  Either sensing an opportunity for [[Lulz]] or in an honest display of [[Butthurt]], David responded.  [[http://www.bobanddavid.com/2007/10/an_open_letter_to_larry_the_ca.html Dear Larry...]]

tl;dr "Larry, you are an unfunny fuck and I am a farting genius."
