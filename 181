'''A challenger appears''' is a catchphrase-turned internet [[meme]] derived from games such as ''[[Street Fighter 2]]''. When a new character is introduced, the phrase '''"A Challenger Appears"''' shows up. Of course, there will always be [[serious]] people who [[bawww|whine]] about how that's [[not]] the [[politically correct|exact wording]] and that wasn't the game in which it appeared originally, so variations of this may include '''"Here comes a new challenger"''' and [[Brawl|'''"A challenger approaches"''']]. 

On the [[internets]], if a related but [[User:Entropy|superior character]] is mentioned people will say a new challenger appears. Challenger is the key word for starting a [[Super Smash Bros|brawl]] on [[4chan]].

==A Category appears==
Although a challenger appears once every 5 minutes, you can never beat the challenger because they have superior [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|firepower]] and use [[hax]]. A challenger appears may be used after someone mentions a [[shiny pidgey]] or after somebody posts a picture of anybody from street fighter. If you do post challenger appears, you lose points for no [[original|originality]] and you make [[internet|God]] frown at you. Good job, [[stupid]]. Other uses include here on our fair [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], check the new user log if you are wondering how so.
