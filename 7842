Stoner
__NOTOC__
[[Image:Stoner_douche_bag.jpg|thumb|right|A Typical Generic Stoner]]

Stoners are a [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|subculture]] of teenage boys who use their parents' money to buy [[marijuana]], which they then smoke in their parents' [[Basement dweller|basements]] with their dumb little buddies while complaining about their parents and weed not being legal. Female stoners do not and should not exist, as [[bitches]] only have [[Fact|half a lung]]. Stoners can often be seen wearing cannabis-themed apparel, including, but not limited to; t-shirts with [[Unfunny|hilarious]] slogans, bandanas, sweatbands, underwear and just about anything else you can physically print a fucking hemp leaf design on. It is important to understand that this kind of behaviour and a willingness to refer to oneself as a 'stoner' is what differentiates stoners from people who simply enjoy [[smoking]] pot and "[[LOL WUT|jammin']]".

Remember that, despite what your grandparents might say, there is only the most tangential connection between marijuana and madness, as seen in the 1937 documentary "Reefer Madness". That is, unless lethargy can be seen as a form of criminal insanity.

Also a term for [[Muslims]] (and historically anyone else) who like to hurl stones at women as punishment for being [[rape]]d.

==Stoners and the Arts==
Stoners have [[Lie|excellent taste in films]] and enjoy such modern cinematic classics as [[Black|Up In Smoke]], [[Shit|Dude, Where's My Car?]], [[Epic Fail|Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle]],[[Pineapple Express]],[[Half Baked]] and anything by [[Fat|Kevin]] [[Cunt|Smith]]. When it comes to [[television]], stoners are invariably fans of [[Adult Swim]] (particularly [[Unfunny|Space Ghost Coast to Coast]] and [[Lame|Sealab 2021]]), [[Family Guy]] and [[South Park]].

[[Music]]- Wise, stoners are known to enjoy the only reggae song ever written ("''Is This Love''" by Bob Marley), '[[Gay|ambient]] [[Bullshit|tossery]]',  bad black person-[[rap]] with unimaginative rhymes about smoking weed, appalling mid-90's third-wave [[ska]], [[Grunge]], and their very own genre: '[[Shit|stoner rock]]'. ''The Irony of It All'' by [[Chav|The Streets]] is also a favourite amongst [[Fags|stoners who don't drink alcohol]] when [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|they decide to get on their pedestal]].

[[Art]]- Stoners normally smoke [[weed]] to create pretty pictures of dogs playing poker but most of these pictures are that of their own colourful shit which is so totally "[[retarded|far out]]". Put a stoner in a room with a canvas and a bag of weed and leave them there for a year and lul as the stoner is dieing. Come back when he dies for extra lulz and his "artwork".

Stoner artists smoke [[weed]] because it may remove the agony of creativity.

==International Differences==
*[[Americunts]] and [[Canadians]] smoke joints without tobacco or filters. Although Americunt stoners will insist that this is because they are '[[LOL WUT|hardcore]]', in reality this is because American weed is [[shit]] and mostly baught from [[Mexico|Mexican]] fags that jumped the border. [[Canadians]], however, do so to dull the cold, and make beaver tail taste better. Feelsgoodman.
*[[Europe|European]] stoners smoke joints with tobacco and a cardboard filter because [[Fact|their skunk is actually decent, and will fuck you up]]. A notable exception to this rule is the [[England|English]], who only get weed in the following three varieties: 
**Covered in [http://www.gritweed.co.uk/gritweed.htm glass beads] and hairspray from scummy-as-fuck [[Chav]] dealers.
**[[jailbait|Sopping wet and uncured]].
**Plain [[Foo Fighters|shit]], at the equivalent of $20 a gram.
*Smoking marijuana in backwards-ass places like [[China]], Singapore and [[Transgender|Thailand]] will get you swiftly and severely [[pwned]] [[IRL]].
