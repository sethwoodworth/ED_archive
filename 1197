Brushie Bat
{{Forced}}

'''Brushie Bat''', or '''Brushie Brushie Brushie''', is a [[meme]] that has been spammed throughout [[b/|/b/]] and the majority of the [[Internets]]. The original photo is of a bat named '''Rubberlegs''' being brushed with a blue toothbrush. This photo was uploaded onto [[Facebook]] by bat enthusiast Mandi Griffith. This image was later discovered by attention-seeking [[newfags]] wanting to create a new meme, which initiated a [[Forced meme|massive spam campaign]] in [[2010]]. The blue toothbrush has been shopped into several images. The toothbrush appears to have magically stress-reliving properties, although this has yet to be proven by [[science]]. Newfags without any shopping skills simply post "brushie brushie brushie" or the original image into threads.
