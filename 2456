[[File:Facetime-mikes.jpg|frame|center|Mike, Dreamhost's employee of the month every month since Julol [[2006]], laughing at Amalea's faggotry.]]<br/><br/><br/>
Complaint submitted to [[Dreamhost]] by [[Amalea]] (anonymously) on [http://discussion.dreamhost.com/showflat.pl?Cat=&Board=curious&Number=16185&page=1&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=14&part= 01/17/05 03:17 PM].

==The Complaint==


''Links and formatting by ED staff.''
:I am about to have an appointment with the [[Peggy A. Lautenschlager|attorney general]] of my state to see if I can have [[Dreamhost|Dream Host]] subpoenaed.

:Dreamhost is hosting a site that stole [[image]]s of me without my consent and said horrible things about [[Amalea|me]].

:It's called [[libel]] and character [[defamation]] along with [[copyright infringement|copyright violation]] (my images are all copyrighted by ME not BY THEM!)

:http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Amalea

:That is the URL in question. I contacted Dreamhost because the [[WHOIS|whois]] search showed that the name servers were directed to dream host.

:I sent them a letter telling them that I want my images removed from that site and here was their reply:

::[[roflcopter|Thank you,]]
::[[lollercaust|- Jeff C.]]
::[[lollerskates|- DreamHost Web Hosting"]]

:I called my state representative (I am his [[slut|webmaster]]) and he is helping me to get into contact with the General [[E-lawyers|attorney]]. If Dreamhost refuses to protect my privacy and safety then the [[Internet Law|law]] will!

:DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!!

== WHAAA WHAA ==

Amalea obviously doesn't know how the law really works, and tries to talk all big like she knows legaleze, just to get her way. "I'm going to go to the attorney general" WHA WHA!! Thats like going to the national guard because you have a roach problem in your house.



== Special Note ==
[[Dreamhost]] was formerly the official webhosting company of [[Encyclopediadramatica]], so big up to them yo!
