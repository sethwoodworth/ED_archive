[[Image:Happy_Birthday_dA_U_by_Tay_Foxy.jpg|thumb|Jark's reaction when [http://tay-foxy.deviantart.com/art/Happy-Birthday-dA-U-61729084/ DA forgot about Yellow Day].]]
Although mentioned in the deviantART article, this drama queen is so [[lulz]]y he deserved his own page.

Scott <s>Jarkoff</s> Jackoff is a [[wapanese|filthy gaijin]] living in [[Japan]] with his [[Japanese]] wife and their hybrid child. He was the founder and/or co-founder of deviantART who is best known for depicting himself as an alien who enjoys sticking a [[in the ass|butt probe]] in people. To further emphasize his [[homosexual|obsession with asses]], Jark also coined the term "Collective Rectum" on deviantART. Thankfully, no one uses it anymore.

He and fellow CEO [http://spyed.deviantart.com Spyed] had two varying accounts of dA history after [http://spyed.deviantart.com Spyed] fired Jark's ass: Jark claims deviantART sprang forth as the result of his sole blood sweat and tears and that [http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/6152945/ Spyed is a big liar, was only an associate at the time, and never worked on the site in the beginning] (this despite the fact that, somehow, Spyed was appointed CEO and majority owner of deviantART inc., what is supposedly Jark's own project.) Spyed claims [http://spyed.deviantart.com/journal/609173/ he was the one who procured the funds to keep the site alive] [http://spyed.deviantart.com/journal/8158988/ when it first started]. But this petty bitch fight isn't what we care about. What we care about is Jark's legendary behavior after his firing and the hilarious turmoil it stirred among the [[Template:DA|devianTARTlets]].

<b>THIS JUST IN</b>- We ''do'' care about the petty bitch fight because Spyed just dropped a motherfucking bombshell, see '''[[Jark#The_Final_Confrontation|The Final Confrontation]]'''.
<br /><br />

==The Firing==
In July of 2005 Jark was canned for unknown reasons. But looking at his behavior following his firing it may be because he's [[batshit]] [[crazy]] and a [[crybaby]]. After being fired he started referring to deviantART as "The Company", started stressing "community" and the [[lie|fact]] he alone cares about the users. 

He also dug up the corpse of a guy named [http://matteo.deviantart.com Matteo] who was apparently another co-founder of the site but hadn't been an admin or even active on the site since about 2002. Like a good lapdog Matteo sprung back to life and lent his support to Jark, and the TARTlets pretended to know who the fuck he is.

===Jark Gets Even=== 

[[Image:Jarkcopypasta.jpg|thumb|left|Jark is such a better leader than those new EVIL deviantART admins (who were in charge all along, but since Jark was fired now they're NEW and EVIL), he cares SO much about the COMMUNITY and every last [[stupid]] [[Template:DA|TARTlet]] that he often responds to comments with [[copypasta]].]]

In his [http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/6081359/ initial journal entry about his firing], Jark had this to say:

{{quote|Remain civil while asking questions. Rioting solves nothing. Diplomacy is necessary. Whether you submit art or write comments, it must remain well-mannered. Trust me when I say that; the administration favors, and listens, to those who can frame their arguments in an intelligent and courteous manner. People who lash out are summarily dismissed by the staff.|Jark}}

[[Image:Jarkkidcry.jpg|thumb|This image isn't meant to try and sway people to MY side at all. Exploiting my child for the sake of my personal vendettas is TEH [[art|ART]]!]]

Then, in a show of [[maturity]] and professionalism, he [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/21272664/ uploaded a photo of his kid looking like he was crying] and blamed the child's tears on Spyed firing him. Here's the exact description from the photo:

"'''Why''' have you been hurt by the guy from Los Angeles, who taught me a few Greek words while he was welcomed in our home in Japan, and stayed here for a week which ended up with him befriending me, only to stab you in the back?

...was it business? <br />

...was it personal? <br />

...was it for money? <br />

...was if for power? <br />

...was it greed? <br />
 
...was there an honest reason? <br />

...'''why''' have you been hurt? <br />

...all I want to know is '''why''', daddy? <br />

your pain is too much for me to handle and I can not keep it inside any longer ... <br />

[[Image:Ohnoesjark.gif|thumb|[http://comments.deviantart.com/1/21272664/159699257 If you only had half a clue as to how deep this is then you would understand.]]]

'''*DISCLAIMER*''': this deviation is in no way to be considered a personal attack on any of the parties involved in "this situation." it is merely here to depict the unintended consequences of ones actions; those that are never considered when decisions are made and implemented. this image is not staged and is not intended to be used as some way to rally the masses; art is emotion and this is nothing but pure, raw, emotions pouring out of someone affected by this severity of the situation."

How he could write that disclaimer with a straight face is anyone's guess. So Jark was definitely, blatantly, trying to inflate his [[e-penis]] by working the whole site up into a tizzy over his firing, but so he didn't look like the [[douchebag]] he was obviously behaving like he tried to play himself off as the innocent saint ([http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/2701720/ who will happily have his son's chest caved in]) trying to keep order at the same time. One might speculate Jark was even delusional enough to think the users could stage some kind of uprising against the site and somehow wrest it from the hands of his dastardly oppressors. 

And so the Jarktards went forth: many users changed their avatars to some shade of yellow (some who even admitted to not previously knowing who Jark was), many went and [[flame|flamed]] Spyed's user page, many hid or deleted their galleries as if anyone would give a flying fuck, the site was bombarded with Jark [[fan art]] which Jark most likely feverishly [[masturbate|masturbated]] to, and arguments between the Jarktards and only slightly more [[common sense|sane people]] erupted all over the news, journals, forums and pretty much everywhere on [[deviantART]]. Jark even got [http://bookdiva.deviantart.com his mom] to join the fray and spit lots of [[E-lawyer|legalese]] at people. All hell broke loose.

===AVENGE ME MY JARKTARDS...but be civil===
Looking through Jark's journals you can see plenty of instances where he's a hypocritical little [[bitch]], nitpicks at the site for the sake of it, tries to manipulate users into causing a commotion, and is totally wanking his [[e-penis]] throughout:

[[Image:Deviantad.jpg|thumb|I am called legion for we are <strike>copy and pasted</strike> many! Fear my Jarktards!]]

{{quote|<small><small>Nothing prevents The Company from explaining away their actions. Let me say that again; there is nothing that prevents $spyed from clearing up the involuntary termination of jark from deviantART, Inc. I have the documentation in hand; it has been analyzed by counsel; there is nothing forbidding the administration from speaking. They opt not to explain their actions out of fear of reprisal from the community, among others.</small></small>|Jark|[http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/6097407/]}}

*Despite there being nothing preventing "The Company" from explaining why they fired him (Spyed cited [http://spyed.deviantart.com/journal/6095324/ legal concerns]) Jark, who presumably has nothing preventing him as well, has never [http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/6119826/ adequately explained] why he was fired either. We're sticking with the "[[crybaby]]" theory.

[[Image:Jarkcomments.jpg|thumb|Desperate deviantART flock to Jark's page when they can't get attention anywhere else.]]

{{quote|<small><small>I need only point to how quickly the popularity of Flickr has grown; from a small site to just about the same size as deviantART in just a little over 1 year. While it is not the same the fact remains that the potential is there, under the right circumstances. A group of highly talented someone's could come along and create the next deviantART. You never know, right? ... The community, through the various projects in support of jark is uniting itself and that, IMHO, is a good thing(tm). Keep it up and never stop; remain strong and civil and in the end the truth will prevail. To use some of ''their'' '''propaganda''' ..."</small></small>|Jark|[http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/6109001/]}}

*Despite continually insinuating he could make a new art website, and having already claimed he coded most of the original dA all by himself, no such project as ever been seen or announced. 

----

{{quote|<small><small>With the recent revelation of my involuntary termination from deviantART, Inc, and subsequent loss of administrative status, the site has been in turmoil. Deviants have come closer together than ever before in order to fight for what they believe in. It is almost beautiful in a poetic way, even under these harsh circumstances.</small></small>|Jark|[http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/6137878/]}}

*FAP FAP FAP.

----

{{quote|<small><small>A protracted legal battle is no good for anyone here. In this case, it would spend money from subscriptions and print purchases that could better be invested in the site itself. After all, if deviantART is allowed to place proper emphasis on the site itself then everyone benefits. With this will come faster browsing, the long awaited search engine, groups, collections, all the great features the current team is excited about, as well as all the fixes and "lost" features everyone would like restored.

To all of you who have been so concerned, please enjoy deviantART for the art. I know many folks have probably felt guilty to do just that over the course of the last few weeks but I think it is time to move past that. Please remain diligent and never fear questioning the actions of the administration but at the same time, end the politics of character assassination. Most of all enjoy deviantART for what it is: a website to share art!</small></small>|Jark|[http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/6383930/]}}

*Jark mentions how a legal battle would be harmful to DeviantART, yet at this point he was ''still'' threatening to sue, and collecting money from gullible [[loser|lulsers]]. He also warns people against "character assassination" despite the fact the photo of his kid blubbering about Spyed being a meanie-butt is still in his gallery. 

===Yellow Day===

Eventually some [[Whitewhale|suckup]] (or maybe it was Jark's own masturbatory idea) got the idea to take deviantART's birthday and turn it into "Yellow Day": a day for Jark fan art and Jark [[e-penis]] sucking. In 2005 this sadly caught on, with people vowing that on August 7th they would upload no art, or only upload yellow art. Many a TARTlet was blinded by the influx of piss-colored artwork. 

However in 2006 "Yellow Day" simply ''didn't happen'', which goes to show TARTlets can lose interest in even their most passionate crusades pretty damn quick.

Jark also tried to initiate the laughable "[http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/6688024/ Matteo Day]" but nothing happened on that day either, because no one gives a [[shit]] who [[Shit nobody cares about|Matteo]] is.

===The Lawlsuit===
So despite previously emphasizing how bad a legal battle would be for deviantART (perhaps using it as a threat to get his precious "$" symbol back) Jark has been openly collecting money from TARTlets so he can sue and potentially financially ruin the site they love. [[lol]] [[what]]?
<br><br>
{{quote|<small><small>The legal battle that is going to ensue between myself, the Yellow Alien, and the Black Ninja, aka Angelo Sotira, is going to be costly. Lawsuits are never cheap. While Angelo has the ability to make use of any, and all, deviantART revenue generated from subscription purchases, print purchases, and more, in order to protect "the corporation" I do not have an "unlimited" budget at my disposal. All the support that the community has offered up until this point is more the greatly appreciated. I have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love that has graced deviantART as a result of my involuntary termination. It is with great hesitation that I now ask the community for more help; this time help in a more material sense.If you are interested in helping then please offer what you can. No pressure on anyone whatsoever. Those that help will have their names listed on the donation page, should they desire, in order to depict the actual number of people that are willing to help contribute to a legal resolution. Of course, should you desire to remain anonymous then I will most definitely respect your wishes. Even if you are unable to donate please spread the word. All help in this effort will not go unnoticed!</small></small>|Jark| [http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/6418270/]}}

So Jark ''has'' collected money from TARTlets. At least 2k looking at his "[http://jarkolicious.com/save-the-alien/ Save the Yellow Alien]" site. However when questioned about how the lawsuit is coming or what further progress he's made on it, Jark is evasive and vague. Some have speculated the money has really gone toward his new puppy and various mysterious [[dildo|electronic gadgets]] of the [[Japan|dark Orient]].

[[Image:No_da_lawsuit.jpg|frame|center|Good question! So where DID all your donation money go, [[user:BadFurDay|Jarktards?]]]]
<br>

==Jark as a devianTART Admin==
The grand [[irony]] in Jark's firing is that thousands of [[weeaboo]] and [[furfag]] TARTlets swarmed to support him, either having forgotten or completely ignorant to the fact that he had massively [[troll]]ed them in the past. 

Back in 2003 (which is [[at least 100 years ago]] in [[internets]] time) a really [[shit]]ty piece of [[animu]] [[fanart]] found its way to the deviantART front page in the "Daily Top Favorites". For those not so TARTingly inclined: that's when a bunch of people decide someone's [[crap]]py art is their "favorite" and if it gets [[over 9,000]] it appears on the front page.

Jark, correctly coming to the conclusion that the [[weeaboo]]s could not use his website properly, decided to ban both [[anime]] and [[furry|anthro]] art from appearing on the front page "Top Favorites". It only lasted for about two months, and where some [[art]]fags praised the decision, but the fact remains that if Spyed or [[Lolly]] pulled any [[shit]] like this today Jark would rally up the site once more and declare its proof the "new" deviantART administration doesn't care about its users.

[[Image:JarkBansAnime.jpg|center]]

[[Image:Scout_Park_by_psyconorikan.jpg|thumb|The shitty drawing that caused the whole controversy and single-handedly got Jark to ban anime and anthro from deviantART's front page for two months. By [http://psyconorikan.deviantart.com/gallery/ psyconorikan], who is now <s>banned from devianTART for misbehavior</s> reinstated and should probably have her own article.]]

{{quote|<small>deviantART does not revolve around anime and anthro, as much as the Daily Top Favorites would like to depict otherwise, and therefore if you are so offended by how things are around here then I suggest you take action of some sort. The first action you need to take is to ensure that even the most obvious of doodles are not “favorited” by the whole of the anime and anthro communities. The fact that you people are incapable of distinguishing between what *should* go in favorites and what should *not* really lowers the perceived intelligence level of the community. You wonder why you people are disliked so much yet you make absolutely no attempt to change your behaviors simply because you people are too hard headed to see that you are wrong.</small>|Jark|[http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/1474044/ pwning the weeaboos.]}}

{{quote|<small>So, in short, the days of seeing nothing but anime and anthro in the daily top favorites due to the inability of those communities to proper police their favoriting activity, is just about over. While I am certain that many folks will rejoice that is not the point of this endeavor.</small>|Jark|[http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/1483897/ This didn't last long. So many broken promises, Jark.]}}

{{quote|Whining and complaining and acting with a mob-like mentality does absolutely nothing to further any “cause.”|Jark|[http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/1492904/ Well he certainly changed his mind about mob-like whining and complaining two years later.]}}

==The Final Confrontation==
On 7 October 2007 Jark posted [http://jark.deviantart.com/journal/14959691/ this journal] in which he bitches about deviantART removing an upload of his that was against their policy, obviously feeding it through the paranoia machine and [[shit]]ting it out as some sort of personal vendetta against him. Since he's unable to follow rules he probably fucking wrote himself, nobody was really buying it.

On 11 October 2007 Spyed, finally fed up and a bit [[butthurt]], responded to a comment by Jark made in response to an argument with yet another TARTlet, [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/14959691/560284647 bringing about a lollercaust by pwning Jark with the facts] the [[internets]] have been begging to hear for 2 years now. Here, archived forever, annotated for great justice, is the confrontation:

[[Image:Jark-finalcont1.png|center|]]
<br><br>
[[Image:Jark-finalcont2.png|center]]

When reached for a comment on the matter, [[Anonymous]] had this to say: "OH SHI-
NO WAI! [[lol|LOOOOOOL]]"<br>
Let's review, shall we?:

*Spyed owned deviantART from day one cause he had the cash to back it up, proving as always that [[money]] makes things work, not  [[Unrealistic_expectations|wishful thinking]]. Jark put up no money up front and let everyone else do the hard work. He's a visionary like that.

*Jark actually fired Matteo, but anyone with an IQ above that of your average TARTlet already figured that out seeing as the two weren't canned at the same fucking time, or even in the same fucking ''year''.

*Jark's wife is apparently a [[whore|gold digging whore]].

*Jark has a [[shit]]load of deviantART stock that's probably worth more than his cyber job ever was, and if the "Company" is selling out and making [[shit]]loads of money off the blood of the innocents as Jark claims, he's [[profit]]ing.

*Spyed ''really'' fucking loves the term "sour grapes". 

So far Jark has yet to respond to what must be untrue, slanderous lies from a cold-hearted corporate whore. Meaning all this [[shit]] is probably true. [[lol|lollerskates]].

<s>'''It should be noted that since this incident Jark has had no activity on devianTART, it is assumed he has fled the internets or become [[an hero]] to restore his Japanese wife's family's honor.'''</s>
