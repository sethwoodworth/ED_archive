'''!''' could refer to :

*Fandom character traits: the proper way to tag corruptions of [[canon]] characters in [[you]]r perverted [[fanfic]] is to put a ! between each big trait before the character name (e.g. [[Yaoi|Uke]]![[Dragon]]![[Tubgirl]]![[Harry Potter|Snape]]).
*'[[Not]]' character in the [[C]] [[programming language]]
*Usually is used when one wants to express [[ZOMG]]!!



==Not Character==

Geeks who have used C-like programming languages will sometimes place a '''!''' before a word to mean "not," especially when writing hopelessly lame joke-code about some [[IRL]] process:

''while(!awake) cout << "Zzz";''


== See Also ==

*[[Oneoneone]]
