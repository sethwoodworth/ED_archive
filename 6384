'''Philip Anthony Thompson''' is a "[[Computer Science III|self-taught computer expert]]" and [[IRL]] [[basement dweller]] who was [[Last Thursday|recently]] apprehended by British authorities for leading [[b|a global child pornography ring]]. Since Philip was too slow to delete his stash, the police were able to recover [[over 9000|nearly 241,000]] pictures from his computer.

==The cover story==

Posing as just another [[Josef Fritzl|well-dressed, polite, middle-class man]] who happens to live in his mother's basement, Philip was free to run his multi-national hive of scum and villainy without the suspicions of his mother, the police, or even [[Chris Hansen]]. Hiding behind [[Deviantart|another site]] used for posting decidedly provocative, but still legal, pictures of [[loli|little kids]], the trail he left went straight to mountains and mountains of [[CP]] and child abuse pictures starring Philip himself on [[711chan|his personal site]]. The bobbies were not amused, however, and immediately revved up the British equivalent of the [[Partyvan]] to put an end to his [[lulz|sick fuckery]].

==The motive==

[[For the lulz|"Thompson did not make any money out of it, he did it simply for self-gratification."]]

==The sentencing==

Philip faces not only more than three years and seven months with [[Bubba]], but maybe even permabanning from the [[internets]] altogether to keep him away from [[loli|potential prey]].
