[[Rule34.com]] is a website created by Alex Shive, of [http://www.niggabytes.com Nigga Bytes], as a way of archiving all forms of [[Rule 34]]. While the archiving and subsequent [[rape]] of all one's childhood memories is an important task, Alex made the mistake of including his own [[watermark]] and [[copyright]] on all the images - much like [[Eric Bauman|a certain e-Jew]].

==Calibre of Material==
Like all good [[Web 2.0]] webmasters, Alex gets quadriplegic orphans to do his job for him, trawling [[4chan|4chan's]] /b/ and [[7chan|7chan's]] /34/ boards to get all of the images that destroy every facet of one's early years. However, in a room behind the orphan chamber sit a coven of [[Jews]] who greedily imprint all of the images with the website's watermark, and claiming copyright over Anonymous' hard, fapped-over work. Alex obviously isn't as clued up on [[law|e-law]] as [[Realitysquared]] or [[Duke Otterland]] and believes that because he (meaning his army of limbless crotchlings) found the images, they are his to copyright. Another complain from Anonymous was that there was no Jetson's porn. /b/ decided to [[Daxflame|teach Alex some things]].

==Rule34.com meets /b/==

At 16:30 on the 3rd of July, 2007, [[Anonymous]] alerted [[/b/]] to the existence of Rule34.com and Alex's faggotry. /b/ was outraged and called upon the legion to make Mr. Shive pay for copyrighting Anonymous' fap-fodder. The plan was simple, upload multiple instances of '''Fig. 1''' a.k.a Poor_Man.jpg (moar like ''Nig. 1'' [[amirite]]?) to the servers overloading them and causing them to explode, hopefully performing a twelfth-trimester abortion on the midget amputees as well. The plan got underway, with the following results:

===Further Annihilation===
Anonymous cleverly suggested the following tactics to further bring down Rule34.com
<pre>
1. Browse to http://www.megaloader.uni.cc/
2. Enter URL to pic of your choice. I chose http://www.rule34.com/g/070704054308.jpg
3. type a message to the server: "brought to you by ebaumsworld"
4. Select x200.
5. Press button.
6. ?????
7. PROFIT!
</pre>
It worked surprisingly well.

==Victory...==
At 17:57 of the same day, Anonymous declared victory as Rule34.com spouted endless [[mySQL]] errors and timed out on the creation of new accounts. Further proof that Anonymous is legion.

==...Is Shortlived==
On the 6th of July, Rule34.com was back online and devoid of MySQL errors. The [[final solution]] will occur soon enough.
