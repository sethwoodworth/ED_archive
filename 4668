Kyleville
'''Kyleville, Ohio''' is a wonderland of tall tales, funny anecdotes, and a heaping helping of traditional wisdom.  The stories may be told and re-told over time, but they never lose their charm or their poignancy.  All you need to do is shut up and listen.  It's plain and simple.  You might find out some really funny stuff if you manage to follow those rules.  If not, you can always pull up a stool at the Junction Pub and yak with all the regulars...if you don't mind hearing a lot of old fishing stories.

==History==
[[File:Kyleville 1.jpg|thumb|The Kyleville grain elevator, 1964]]
Kyleville, Ohio is a small bump on the interstate between Hersh, Ohio and Union City.  Originally settled around 1820, Kyleville had brief fame in the 1950's as a small honky-tonk Mecca of sorts because of the construction of the Starlight dance hall and roller rink.  The Starlight had many famous performer's pictures on its walls but unfortunately it went out of business in 1974 after several years of low sales numbers.  In 1982, the building was purchased by ACI Holdings Company, Inc. and the building was torn down.  Currently, it is rumored (by the Junction Pub regulars) that the empty lot will soon be home to a brand new Walmart.

The main strip of Kyleville, located on Middleton Avenue (also home to Buck Shore's Electronics) is known as the "Bank Block" because the original settlers of Kyleville built three banks (Ohio Farmer's Credit, founded in 1890, is still open) in the space of one city block.  Yes, the "Bank Block" is on the National Register of Historic Places.  Until about 1986, the block was composed mainly of the Kyleville Piggly Wiggly, Cooper's Tasty Freeze, and Mr. B's carry out.  After 1986, most of the newer buildings were torn down in an effort to restore the Bank Block to its pre-50's look and feel.

Surrounded by a vast farming community, Kyleville is a rural setting where you are more likely to hit a possum with your pick-up truck than you are to hit a pot hole.  The current Board of Selectmen holds meetings every second Tuesday of the month.  During these meetings you will overhear the Planning Commission discuss such topics as: "Placement of stop lights at both Atkins road's intersection with State Route 736 and the Pullman Road bypass," and "Re-sodding the Kyleville High School's varsity football stadium field."  Kyleville is proud of their 1978 and 1981 state football championships, so don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

==Around Town==

There are several local "characters" who populate the town of Kyleville.  One noted member of the little burg is Jim Otis.  He currently operates the only Army surplus store in all of Union county, but it is not his work there that makes him so special.  Jim's wife Bertie is a long time sufferer of diabetes.  During the fall of 1983, Bertie contracted glaucoma from her diabetic situation and sadly, she lost her sight.  Jim now dotes on Bertie and takes her everywhere she needs to go.  You can see Jim, arm and arm with his beloved Bertie as he walks her down Corton avenue towards her weekly quilting sessions at Henrietta Welstead's Cape Cod styled home.  Ask Jim for help and he is quick to lend it.  He also donates much of his time to the local Elks guide dog drive as he is the chair person.

On the other side of the tracks, you will see the new Burger King located on the lot where the old Hershel's burger joint was located.  Hershel retired in 1990 and left no heirs to take over his once thriving hamburger stand.  Next to the Burger King is Ben's Tool shop.  You will often find Ben Hamilton working on his motorcycles...including a 1938 Fathead that he loves to drive in the Fourth of July parade.  But don't let these friendly people fool you.  Both lots back up against the old football stadium, now a local hangout for young men and women who are seeking a more private place to be.  Union county sheriff Tony Carstons can often be found patrolling the old gridiron with his flashlight much as he patrolled that same gridiron in 1981 as a member of the state champion Kyleville Crusader's defense.

Finally, no tour of Kyleville would be complete without mentioning the grain elevator.  True, the original elevator blew up due to a dust problem that involved several hundreds of gallons of kerosene, but out of the ruins comes good news for the citizens of Kyleville:  Con Agra has agreed to purchase the ruined buildings, train depot, and acreage surrounding the mostly destroyed facility to build a new distribution point for the farmers of Union County.  Now, if only we could get the price of soy beans above $7.00 per bushel, we might really be making some progress!
