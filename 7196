{{quote|There are some similarities becau there are some similarities, but the similarities are small compared to the big.|'''Duane'''}}
|}

He was birthed from the YouTube [[Sailor_moon|Sailor Moon]] community, which has no quality standards by its very [[Basement-dweller|definition]].  The Sailor Moon series died in the 1990s, after 200 episodes of animated [[copypasta]], and fans have been forced to create their own [[Fanfiction|high quality original content]] for over 15 years.

It is known that he writes in composition note books some mysterious fan fiction called Sailor Moon and the Talismans, combining [[sailor moon]] with Ernest and the talismans from Jackie Chan adventures. He is exactly like [[Christian Weston Chandler]], Despite the fact that he denies this while enjoying sailor moon [[hentai]]. 

Spoiler alert: He currently has a sexy new 'chinese asian girlfriend' who, SHOCKINGLY turned out to be himself.

He is currently under the influence of '''==LUCIFER=='''
