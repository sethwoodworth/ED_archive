Basin Hills Project Redux
On October 13, 2008 a [[Tripcode|tripfag]] called LordPhantom posted in /x/ that he was going to begin an [[Operation Falcon Punch|Operation Falcon Punch]] like game.

==Clue 1==

Later LordPhantom posted his first clue.

It soon became evident that Lord Phantom lacked the professionalism to create a truly [[Mindfuck|mindfucking]] game and that the guys in /x/ lacked the necessary [[Retard|brain power]] to find out the simplest of clues. After 5 hours of trying he eventually had to hold /x/ by the hand and rub their noses in the answer.

The clue was the latitude and longitude of a street intersection in New York City.

==Conclusion==

Time has yet to tell if this will be [[epic|epic]] or [[Fail|fail]] dramatically. So far the meters are pointing to fail.


You have all failed me. The clue is still there as I count the fourth day.../x/ has failed me.
