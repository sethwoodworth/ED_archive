KawaiiNekoGirl/Chat logs
Some chat with one of [[KawaiiNekoGirl]]'s yes men. Usual shit, whining about Nekogirl's ED article. Remember children, the Internet is [[serious business]]!

[prettyXvacant] says:
Can I ask you something?
Kumori says:
Sure.
Kumori says:
You ask today if you want. :B Multitasking isn't easy for me.
[prettyXvacant] says:
Same here, talking to three or four people just one second.
[prettyXvacant] says:
OK
[prettyXvacant] says:
back
Kumori says:
I'm managing about eight people here, as well as a few other things.
[prettyXvacant] says:
Ah.
[prettyXvacant] says:
Ok.
Kumori says:
But continue.
[prettyXvacant] says:
Well, ok the last time we talked you said that some of the things on there were not done by you. I want to know if you were the one who updated it.
Kumori says:
Hum? Most I've done ED related lately was work on PilgrimJohn's page.
Kumori says:
But I wouldn't bother with KawaiiNekoGirl's page. She's an old meme.
Kumori says:
Aka no more lulz.
[prettyXvacant] says:
lulz?
Kumori says:
Lulz = Laughs
Kumori says:
Lurk moar.
Kumori says:
Out of curiousity, who are you on deviantART?
[prettyXvacant] says:
I'm not on dA
Kumori says:
Don't worry, not gonna make an ED page or whatever on you.

Ah.
[prettyXvacant] says:
I'm a friend of hers irl
Kumori says:
Ah.
Kumori says:
I see.
[prettyXvacant] says:
Can I ask you something?
Kumori says:
Sure.
[prettyXvacant] says:
You said you knew her a short time before you made the page right?
Kumori says:
It's rather for quite some time. The ED article didn't pop up until months afterwards.
[prettyXvacant] says:
Were you friends?
Kumori says:
Though she blocked me from her page when I was on deviantART.

What makes you ask that?
[prettyXvacant] says:
I want to know?
Kumori says:
Is it really worth asking?
[prettyXvacant] says:
Yes.
[prettyXvacant] says:
To me, yes.
Kumori says:
Before I answer that... I feel I should be able to ask a question on this.
[prettyXvacant] says:
Ok.
[prettyXvacant] says:
Shoot
Kumori says:
Considering I gave you a fair share to ask.

Very well.
Kumori says:
Any reason as to why you're stuck on that ED page?
[prettyXvacant] says:
Yes, she's my friend and I'm stubborn. I don't like it, and I don't understand why you did it.

Anything else?
Kumori says:
You're new to the Internet, aren't you?
[prettyXvacant] says:
No. I'm not. Don't assume.
Kumori says:
I never assumed.
Kumori says:
I merely questioned.
Kumori says:
Though getting upset about an ED page will probably force me to reply with "Internet - Serious business!" or something like that.
[prettyXvacant] says:
I really don't give a fuck. ._. It's the internet you can say what you want but so can I.
Kumori says:
Uhh... 'k?
[prettyXvacant] says:
Are you going to answer my question? I did yours.
Kumori says:
Oh, for the friend thing. Of course not.
Kumori says:
Out of curiousity, why do you really care about the whole matter? :B
[prettyXvacant] says:
Because I'm her friend. And because she was upset by it. Look, to me it's not a joke. Is that so hard to grasp for you?
Kumori says:
I'd rather know how it benefits you, not her. But allow me to respond to the latter in the following way: http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/b/b2/Seriousbusiness2.jpg
[prettyXvacant] says:
I'm not even looking. I'm sick of this, it's not benefitting me, and I'm not doing it because she told me to or any crap like that. I'm doing it because to me IT'S NOT A JOKE. How many times do I have to tell you that? She has feelings, you hurt them, and I don't like that. Do you not get that?
Kumori says:
Internet - Serious business!
Kumori says:
If it's not benefitting you, then like... why are you making a big deal out of it?
[prettyXvacant] says:
God, you're stupid. Because I'm her friend and I care, ok?
Kumori says:
Considering she's an old meme.
Kumori says:
That doesn't benefit to your reason. That would be for reason.
Kumori says:
*for her.
Kumori says:
Anyway, if you would really want to benefit your friend, go comfort her or some other form of interaction among friends. Questioning me won't really do you much good nor bothering the admins about the page since they would more than likely laugh and ask for a fee to removing it.
Kumori says:
Though they would more than likely laugh in your face.
Kumori says:
Which I'd support said statement.
[prettyXvacant] says:
I need to go, I'll be back later. I'll talk to you then.</pre>
