'''Gene Eugene Turnbow''', known as '''Gene Turnbow''' (born ca. 1956), is an aging [[griefer]] and [[stalker]] in the Internet-based game [[Second Life]] who believes he is [[Superman]] and even enjoys dressing like Superman in [[real life]]. He uses the avatar name '''Kalel Venkman''', i.e. [[Superman|Kal El]] (and possibly others), and is the founder, leader and by far most active member of the [[Justice League Unlimited]] griefing/vigilante organization.

Turnbow uses all his spare time to ruin the Second Life experience for other users, and additionally excessively collects information about other people in Second Life, particularly members of the [[Patriotic Nigras]] and [[Woodbury University]], and stores it in a private wiki[http://foo.secondlifeherald.com/slh/2010/01/justice-league-unlimited-secret-wiki-unmasked-by-the-wrong-hands.html]. After his secret wiki was leaked to the public, he has harassed ISPs with fake copyright claims in order to suppress distribution of it[http://foo.secondlifeherald.com/slh/2010/01/roleplay-superman-tries-coverup-of-jlu-wiki-leak.html].

When he get banned for cause from estates for his griefing activities, he sometimes convinces [[Plexus Linden]] to unban him from the estate in question and ban the estate owner instead.

A man in his 50s from Simi Valley in the Los Angeles area in California, he works as a "technical writer, wiki admin and trainer of animators at Rhythm & Hues Studios, Inc." according to his LinkedIn profile[http://www.linkedin.com/in/geneturnbow].

==Death threats==
After Tizzers Foxchase and some other /b/tards that happen to live close to Kalel in real life, decided to knock on Kalel's door while in costume and trick-or-treating on Halloween[http://foo.secondlifeherald.com/slh/2007/12/super-hero-supe.html], Mr. Turnbow made death threats against them:

:[22:35] Kalel Venkman: Had I been home at the time, I'd have been within my legal rights to shoot them all dead on the spot.
:[22:35] Kalel Venkman: Four shots, wouldn't even empty the clip
