Gif war
A '''gif war''' is a [[flame war]] done entirely with images. Although JPEGs and PNGs are allowed, GIF is preferable because it allows animation. A gif war can be executed using regular images or [[image macro]]s.

There are only two ways to end a gif war:
# One of the sides concedes that he has been [[pwned]].
# [[Fifty Hitler Post]]

==The Game==
[[Image:Penguin.jpg|thumb|It took time to find a picture of a dead penguin, but it was worth it to further the campaign of a gif war.]]
Soon after the coining of the phrase "[[gif]] [[war]]" (believed to be coined by [[jameth]]), the game appeared. Here are the rules for the {{ljcomm|user=gifwars}} community, which is dedicated to the gif war game:

#One of the [[moderators]] posts a picture (only a few people can post entries).
#You reply to the post with a picture that "beats" that picture. Examples:
##A picture of a [[fat]] [[chick]] beats a picture of a malnourished child.
##A picture of a Stairmaster 2000 beats the picture of the fat chick.
##A picture of a bucket of water beats a picture of a forest fire.
##A picture of someone peeing in a river beats the picture of the bucket of water.
##A picture of a dead penguin beats a picture of a live penguin.
##Et cetera.
#Even though this community is called GIF Wars, the pictures do not have to be GIFs. They can be anything.
#A GIF War will go on as long as it has to.
#If someone posts something like [[Chuck Norris]] or any other [[Uncyclopedia|old, unfunny meme]] they're to be immediately [[b&]].
