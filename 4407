Jonathan Swift
Jonathan Swift was an [[unfunny]] author of many [[shitty]] [[book]]s and a renowned [[IRL Troll]] from [[Ireland]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Irish.jpg|thumb|Swift at his wedding, monogamy indeed.]]
Jonathan Swift, son to an [[English]] mother, was born a pampered, [[rich and beautiful]] [[The Aristocrats|aristocrat]]. He owned several farms in the fields outside Dublin and spent most of his childhood writing [[angst]]y stories, sucking [[potato]] juice, and [[molest]]ing [[cow|cattle]]. After attending college, Swift went to England to become a [[politician]] but was soon labeled a [[User:Christopher|pedophile]] after he was caught sleeping with an 8 year old girl named Stella. Ostracized from society, Swift and Stella quickly fled back to Ireland.

Swift subsequently got a high position in the [[Alcohol|Irish government]] and spent the next 50 years smoking pot and getting high on LSD. He wrote many books about going on these acid trips, visitng the land of [[midget]]s, the land of giants, the magical island of [[whore|La Puta]] (see [[Spanish]]), and a kingdom of [[intellectual]] [[Mr. Hands|horses]].

In his later life, Swift became a [[John Kerry|limousine liberal]] and got involved with criticizing the British for their unfair treatment of Irish peasants. The British, in an attempt to get rid of him, invited him to a banquet and offered him a large plate of cyanide pills, telling him that they were "biscuits". Swift, like the [[drug]]ged [[fat|lardass]] he was, voraciously ate them all and immediately died. Because of this, he is considered to be the greatest [[Irish]] hero in [[history]] [[EVAR]]!!!

{{quote|A Modest Proposal: For Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland from Being a Burden to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick, commonly referred to as A Modest Proposal, is a Juvenalian satirical essay written and published '''anonymously''' by Jonathan Swift in 1729. Swift appears to suggest in his essay that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. By doing this he mocks the authority of the British officials.}}

I don't see why this is satire [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsQToqtMHrw&feature=fvw]. Articles on Jews and [[Rape]] are much more satiricalness. Swift's article just states the obvious  and therefore lacking in [[lulz]].

P.S. Here's a good recipe that can be used for cooking delicious Irish babies. (http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-live/roast-suckling-pig-recipe/index.html) (Obviously most Irish babies weigh less than 15 pounds due to foetal alcohol syndrome, so adjust recipe accordingly.)
