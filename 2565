'''EVERYDAY I'M HUSTLIN''' (video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxQk1Q9_u1Q here]) is yet another meme inspired by a song. Unlike [[WHEN I WAS]] and [[THE BEST]], this song is done by prison guard/rapist turned [[Mainstream|hardcore]] [[Rapist|rapper]] [[Rick Ross]]. It originated as a meme on 711chan, but was posted thousands of times over on [[4chan|4chan's]] [[b|/b/]] and [[420chan|420chan's]] ''/wooo/'' board until it became mostly unfunny and overused, just ''like'' [[WHEN I WAS]] and [[THE BEST]].

==Image History==

For some reason, instead of a Rick Ross picture to go with the song, wrestling [[Failure|"legend"]] Ted Dibiase is posted instead. This may have been done [[irony|ironically]], implying that he [[Pimp|has money and hustles]], when it's known by all that he's [[poor]], and what money he did have was spent on [[Crack|crack-cocaine]] and Vicodin.

==Media==

The song was used in [[Hillary Clinton|Grand Theft Auto 4]] for Katt Williams' in-game skits and one of his [[Unfunny|comedy specials]], forcing it's more recent popularity in the general population. In fact, speaking of Katt Williams, he seems the most fond of the song, as it makes sense that a man who played a midget pimp in an Ice Cube movie and raises 9-10 adopted kids would [[no|"hustle" his entire life]].
