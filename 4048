'''Intellectuals''' are the people who are either more intelligent than you and know it, more well-educated than you and know it, or just think that they are both, with no basis in fact. But hey, reality is overrated after all.  

When they aren't in a Borders Books reading [[emo]] poetry ridden with [[angst]], nonchalantly sipping lattes, quoting [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] or burning American flags, intellectuals can be found on the [[internets]] arguing with anybody who'll give [[attention]] to their ideas on politics, technology and religion. 

NOTE: If you do not either [[Essjay|have a Ph.D]] or a [[Mensa]] membership, you are a pseudointellectual and you can go [[die]] [[in the ass|in a hole]]. 

Intellectuals are typically particularly high-profile as [[nazis|voices of dissent]] in times of [[jews|politically extreme governments]]. Of course, when the government becomes sufficiently extreme, they become very low profile due to being quite [[dead]].

Intellectuals have the ability to evolve quickly in order to adjust to just about any habitat, from [[elitist]] members-only politics forums to snobbish journals characterized with little or no [[icons]]. Their traditional breeding grounds, however, are located in the steamy depths of [[kuro5hin]], where they occasionally meet to procreate through massive [[circle jerk|circle jerks]].
