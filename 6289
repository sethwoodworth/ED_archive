A born-[[bald]] Shakespearean [[actor]] from Yorkshire, [[England]], best known for being and starring as the Captain Picard from  ''[[Star Trek]]'' who is bald.

He's bald, has very little hair, and is also bald. He's considered perfect for playing the role of Professor X in ''[[X-men]]'' because he's bald.  His more famous twin brother, Gavin MacLeod (also bald), played Captain Merril Stubing on ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075529/ The Love Boat]''.

He has fucked untold thousands of hot bitches (including [[your mom]]). Many of these were aliens and likely did not have [[vaginas]], but this did not stop him, as luckily even alien women like it [[in the pooper]].
