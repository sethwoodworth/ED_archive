'''[http://www.furaffinity.net FurAffinity]''' is a [[furry art]] site and [[community]], (incorrectly) valued at [[Over 9000|over]] [http://www.formspring.me/dragoneer/q/205063809 $50,000] by its [[Dragoneer|owner]], and is perhaps the greatest congregation of mentally challenged people online. As such, it is perhaps the most vile den of fail on the Internet, giving even 4chan a run for its money. FurAffinity is perpetually stuck in 1997, featuring the greatest in [[Web 2.0|Web 1.0]] technology and design principles. 

Trying to troll the forums is next to useless, because if the abusive modfags don't get you the insanity will. However trolling is not limited to simply pissing off the mods, as you are about to find out. Which other types? Read on.

==The Founding==
[[Image: Ferrox LLC.png|thumb|Pennsylvania Department of Revenue registration for Ferrox LLC.]]
FurAffinity ('''FA''') was founded in [[2005]] after [[SheezyArt]] told the [[furfags]] to [[GTFO]] and to stop posting [[yiff| yiff art]]. About five minutes after the SheezyArt [[moderator]] post, some guy posted a link to FA, which had apparently been coded in those same five minutes. 

Shortly after the site's founding, they suffered their first 'hack attack' and immediately blamed [[everyone]] who was not a [[ContiE|porn-loving furry]] for [[fursecution|keeping them down]]. This happened about eight times (in a row) until someone actually did hack the site by [http://www.livejournal.com/community/furaffinity/18990.html having a period all over it]. Eventually all the crying wolf actually did attract the attention of a [[hacker]], who proceeded to hack the database and in a matter of [[time]] posted everyone's passwords to the entire internet. But really it was all [[Sibe]] (for serious). The mods were angered at this hacking, and responded in the only way they knew how to — by posting a warning for him to not do it again (and also threatening to take the hacker to [[internet court]].)

FurAffinity is now owned by "Ferrox LLC". Funny that the sole officer of this "company" is [[Dragoneer|Sean Piche]].
[[Image:Patachu_Dragoneer_Jews.png| [Dragoneer|Sean "Dragoneer" Piche], Site owner, financial manager and leader of furries, usually running away with donations.]]

==The Site==
Described as having [http://eevee.livejournal.com/329409.html more holes than swiss cheese], FurAffinity runs on its own custom site software that was programmed by [[Retard|experts]]. The site has [http://eevee.livejournal.com/329817.html over 30] known security holes and vulnerabilities that the staff refuses to take action on because they are all [[lazy]]. Once these holes are exploited, the staff will often [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/86916-Hide-Comments-won-t-work-anymore disable] the [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/68841-So-let-me-get-this-straight feature] instead of "fixing" it. The site is so poorly coded that users [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/36091-Showing-up-as-another-user-in-their-account using the same ISP may spontaneously be logged into another users account]. Of course, FA blames the ISPs and not the crappy coding.

The first time the site's broken code became public knowledge was in August 2007 during FurAffinity: United!, the site's convention, when Dragoneer logged onto FA over public wifi and promptly had his session snatched. The person that took control of Dragoneer's account added the following message to the site:
{{quote|Administrator notice: We're sorry, our vaginas are currently full of sand. We're makin' pearls here, folks! :D! FA:U rocks. We all got handjobs from Glaide and Damaratus. -- hacked by jheryn}}
FA administrators promptly shit their pants and shut the site down for 48 hours. It would take nearly 3 more years (2010) before FurAffinity finally implemented SSL for logins.
===Site Operations===
FurAffinity's administration team is the largest collection of incompetent website administrators on the internet, which is blatantly obvious to anybody who is not a [[furfag]], and ignores and rejects help from people who know what they're doing.  It's a well known [[fact]] that the furries worst enemies at [[SomethingAwful]], [[4chan]] and even [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] run their sites better than Dragoneer and company. The entire site is kept alive by donations because Dragoneer is too stupid to figure out how to monetize the site, claiming he's not looking to for "the good of the community", even though the "community" barely donates enough to cover FA's massive hosting bill. They [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/1460-50-000-Reasons-You-Should-Donate-To-FA can't even come up with good reasons for people to donate], so instead are now bribing people with [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1836349/ shiny pixels]. {{cs2|bluerooquote|Help? No thanks, we're good!|{{squote|I drew up a redundant server architecture for FA. FA never need have to go offline ever. People pay good money for this, but you got it for free. It was ignored.

I found cheap but reliable servers for FA. That was ignored.

I *IMPLEMENTED SEARCH*. Stupidly fast, scalable, easy to maintain search was READY TO GO. 3 hours of coding was all that was required to integrate it with the site. Search could have been up LAST YEAR. It was ignored.

I brought up security issues. Tons of them. They were ignored. I had to publicly quit the site to bring any attention to one.

I brought up lots of concerns, issues, design ideas, and improvements. Improvements that don't require new servers, but instead a little thinking. They were ignored.

Frankly, you are offline now because FA is appallingly mismanaged. Had you followed any of the advice that I, and others, have given you, FA would be up right now.

You wasted the money you raised by buying over-powered hardware that you don't need, to do the wrong things, and solve the wrong problems. Last I heard, you raised over $16k. You've since blown it on two completely inappropriate servers. Good god, for $16k you should be able to run the site for months. But instead of being efficient, you once again take the wasteful route. You took advantage of this situation to buy the biggest shiniest toys you could find.

Just like the numerous past server failures and scalability issues, you will have problems again. And again you will wail and gnash your teeth and hide behind the sad excuse of "hardware failure". This is, what, the 6th time FA has had an extended outage due to server issues? Once is understandable. Twice a fluke. But it's quite obvious that despite running in to the same issues over and over, you never learn. Good god man, hardware failure hasn't been a valid excuse for site failure since 1994. Thankfully for you, the community has an extremely short memory.|Former staff member blueroo|[http://forums.vivisector.org/index.php/topic,130.msg968.html#msg968 archived on Vivisector]}}}}

===Site Security===
On January 17, 2011, someone noticed a number of system files were exposed at furaffinity.net/system/. These files included the Password salt, the MD5 hash, the Database credentials, and an insight into FA's terrible coding. While all this was going on, Dragoneer was in [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/89577-Fur-Affinity-Turns-6! this thread] talking about how he wants to [[DOING IT WRONG|fix FA]]. These files have likely been exposed for years.

That about sums up their site security.

===Hardware===
[[File:Fa_bill.jpg|thumb|right|Nobody ever said [[Dragoneer]] was good with money.]]
FurAffinity owns 10 of their own servers because that makes the admins feel [[Penis|important]]. The 10 servers, along with their router and switch, take up no more than 15U (rack units) but are housed in a cabinet almost 3x bigger. As of December 15th, 2010, 4 of the 10 servers are unused (one is being used for "[http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1910947/ advanced data logging]" (see: installing [http://www.cacti.net/ Cacti] so they can see pretty charts). Prior to installing the aforementioned 4 unused servers, FA was using a cabinet [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/File:Furaffinity_Server_Farm.jpg 1/4 the size].

FurAffinity's Database and Application servers are both maxed out with 64GB of RAM because they are too lazy to code the site to run more efficiently. 

===FA vs. other sites===
Dragoneer is not afraid to show his [[Nerd rage|opposition and hatred]] towards sites that compete with the only thing keeping him relevant in the fandom. Often his [[rage]] is directed towards '''Inkbunny''', a site similar to FA but launched in early 2010 with features Dragoneer has been "planning" on adding to FurAffinity for years. Now, in fits of rage against InkBunny, you may hear him claim that offering prints on demand is almost as bad as being a paysite, even though a year before Inkbunny launched he was discussing [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/34041-Offering-Prints-via-FurAffinity how he planned on offering on-demand printing for FA]. He'll also point out Inkbunny is run by [[Softpaw Magazine|pedos]], like that makes it any worse than a site run by retards and a dogfucker.

==Promises Unkept==
[[File:Furaffinity-timeline.jpg|rightcenter|thumb|300px|This handy timeline sums up FA's mediocre existence.]]
FurAffinity (mostly [[Dragoneer]]) has a bad habit of announcing the Next Great Thing™ and then not following through on it. These projects are documented below.

===Project Ferrox===
'''Ferrox''' is Furaffinity's ongoing, neverending project to upgrade the site code to make it suck less. It has been tossed around since shortly after the site was founded, but didn't really get anywhere until 2006 when Dragoneer [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/1470-FA-Code-Update-Project-Ferrox announced] the first version of Ferrox was in development. Shortly after the announcement, it was said that Ferrox would [[Never|soon]] [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/1641-Questions-and-Poll-on-the-Ferrox-Code enter closed beta].

A little over a year later (and having never entered beta), Ferrox was restarted from scratch and released as open-source software. The project showed promise until [[Pokemon|Eevee]], who was the lead coder for Ferrox, [http://eevee.livejournal.com/300227.html got pissed off] at [[Dragoneer]] and left. Since then, the project has been doomed to [[Fail|failure]].

On January 16, 2011, Dragoneer announced once again that they were developing a new version of the site. This is the fourth time he has done so.

===Redesign===
[[File:Page-rev-2.0.png|left|thumb|The new FurAffinity. Will debut around the same time as [[Duke Nukem Forever]] and [[Gabe Newell|Half-Life 3]]]]
In 2009, with Ferrox dead and the site still looking like something a high-school [[CSIII]] student could produce in an afternoon, FurAffinity actually started making progress on a project [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/7472-FA-Project-UI-Overhaul announced two years earlier] to redesign the site to look more [[Web 2.0|modern]]. The redesign was originally slated to debut in December 2009, before being pushed to mid-2010 so they could preform hardware upgrades, before being pushed yet again to "Sometime in 2010" even after said upgrades were complete. In May 2010, Dragoneer said they were aiming for [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/72193-New-FA-looks-exactly-like-steam-amp-DA-!-WTF!!?p=1853302&viewfull=1#post1853302 a summer release]. It is widely believed that FurAffinity runs on [[Gabe Newell|Valve Time]].

On January 16, 2011, Dragoneer announced that FurAffinity would be [[Scam|paying]] a "UI Designer" (see: [[CSIII]]; FA doesn't have the money to hire [[actual]] developers and designers) to finish the UI project "right". When asked why he wasn't willing to pay for developers to fix their broken code, he ran to his [[hugbox]] and ignored theme questions.

===On-Demand Printing/Artist Marketplace===
A plan to let artists sell digital prints of their art through FurAffinity was in the works from sometime in 2007 or 2008 and was even listed on [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/4/49/Sean_Piche_Resume_From_LinkedIn.png Dragoneer's resume] (despite the fact he's said he doesn't know how to code before). This project was still in the works in [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/34041-Offering-Prints-via-FurAffinity early 2009] but was seemingly abandoned after [[Inkbunny]] began offering similar services.

===Hosting===
At some point in early 2010 Dragoneer thought it'd be a good idea to run out and buy a [[Greed|second webserver]] with the [http://twitter.com/furaffinity/status/10203450025 intent of offering hosting on it.] The service was supposed to launch in [http://twitter.com/furaffinity/status/10942579229 mid to late 2010] but never materialized. The server is currently [[Retard|hosting a number of virtual machines]] (yes, they give each of the following its own VM AND its own IP) for FA's ad server, the FA Wiki, FA: United, an IRC server, an IRC server and a mail server, and their URL shortener (discussed below).

Of course, Dragoneer likes the way things are now, where if you are one of Dragoneer's buddies you can have your own hosting for free, paid for by [[gullible|community donations]]. Creating a hosting service would be [[work]], and Dragoneer has a tragic [[fat|allergy to work]] that prevents him from exerting any effort on anything at all.

===pss.ms URL shortener===
The Opossums URL shortener (because there's [http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/Web_Design_and_Development/Hosted_Components_and_Services/Redirects/ not enough of those on the internet already]), found at the [[Clever|Oh-so-clever]] URL pss.ms, was a feature that was randomly [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1648317/ announced in August 2010] and advertised as coming "[[Duke Nukem|very soon]]" to FA. One of the "big" features the service will have is white-listing: Sites that are [[Irony|safe and secure]] will be put on a whitelist so clicking the link takes you directly there. Non-whitelisted sites will [[Annoying|display a warning]].

===Filters===
Shortly after the first Cubporn debate, Dragoneer announced that Cub art was going to be allowed to stay on FA, and the reason being was that soon, a [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/3965-FA-Policy-Notice-Cub-Art feature where you could filter out submissions] based on tags was coming in the "near future".

When cub porn was finally banned for good four years later in 2010, there were no filter features in place.

===Other===
* FurAffinity has also claimed to be working on [[over 9000]] other "features" ranging from gallery folders to profile badges for donators and much, much more. In the end, FA has changed very little since 2005 and is likely to stay this way for the foreseeable future.
* The FA staff and various faggots they hang out with use FA as their own personal property (personal property paid for by "community donations", of course), including one box [[retard|with a RAID server]] and [[over 9000]] more [[hax|insecure]] legacy services exposed. There is also an [[spam|unexplained redirect]] to a retail site that just happens to be in the same country as one of the coders (TRY TO GUESS WHICH ONE. Hint: [[obvious|there's only one coder]]) Of course, when furries question [[theft|where the money's going]], then it's [[bullshit|all about the community]].

==The Staff==
{{notice|Becase [[at least 100]] FA staff members have resigned recently, this section needs moar content! Plz to be going [http://www.furaffinity.net/staff/ here] and finding [[Lulzcow|suitable candidates]].}}
[[Image:Dragoneer killed.jpg|thumb|The easiest and fastest way to get your arse permabanned from Furaffinity without breaking the TOS.]]
{{quote|There was no guidance, no mentoring, no direction, no clear roles. The staff was in disarray with most of the administrators doing nothing or just the absolute minimum.|Dave Hyena|[http://forums.vivisector.org/index.php/topic,193.0.html Recounting when he first became a FA admin].}}
While most website administrators and staff take [[Gay|great pride]] in their website and work hard to improve the site to be it's best, the staff of FurAffinity is made of up [[ego|egotistical]] fuckwads who are far too lazy to do anything to make the site better. FurAffinity's admins are a varying collective of emotionally insecure and [[Asperger's syndrome|socially awkward]] rejects who haven't even a single clue of what to do when it comes to having the responsibility as a site admin. This certain flaw, which also applies to FurAffinity's forum-goers and- well, pretty much  almost the entirety of the site can be [[exploit]]ed in order to achieve dickloads of [[lulz]].

FurAffinity's staff is notorious for their constant inconsistency in enforcing site rules, and when [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/84940-The-quot-Accountability-quot-Thread called out on this] they will refuse to answer while the FA Forums [[white knight]] brigade tells everyone that the staff doesn't have to answer your questions because [[Dragoneer]] is the [[North Korea|Dear Leader]] and [[Communism|his word is law]], regardless that the site stays afloat because of [[Money|donations]] from the community.

===Dragoneer/Preyfar===

'''''Notice:''' This article is a short version. To know more about Sean Piche/Dragoneer and his failure, go [[dragoneer|there]]''
[[Image:DragoneerIRL.jpg|thumb|Dragoneer [[IRL]] drinking paint thinner before updating FurAffinity's website code.]]
[[File:Dragoneer_bans.jpg|thumb]]

'''Dragoneer''' (a.k.a. '''Sean Piche''') is the [[Luser|lead administrator]] and owner of FurAffinity. In this position, Dragoneer does nothing except deal with [[drama]], [[ban]] people, and complain how hard his "job" running FA is. Dragoneer is also FurAffinity's version of [[wikipedia:Muhammad_Saeed_al-Sahhaf|Baghdad Bob]], often having to cover up embarrassing site attacks or his own stupidity. Some of these events are featured later in this article.

Dragoneer is the furries' best friend forever, plays nice with people and flames them in private or on irc, drowns any serious discussion with lulzy quotes, memes and vomits some unfunny [[YouTube]] video such as [[Leeroy Jenkins]]. Also he's probably +watching you even if he has no idea what the content of your gallery is, but no one would protest against Dragoneer, as having notorious watchers is more important!

Sadly, much of what comes out of his mouth is a lie when it comes to anything controversial. Before his rise to fame as the Overlord of Furaffinity, he was known as being a very hardened advocate of [[ethnic cleansing|cleansing]] the fandom of babyfurs. (sadly, the rant in his livejournal has been bawleeted.) This comes as a surprise since he has recently been found playing "hide the sausage" with another furry who is obsessed with being a kid ([[babyfur]]) it has lead to his once proud stance of being against babyfurs of the fandom to realizing they're surprisingly tight. His new fling can be found [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/kipfox/ here] and his gallery is filled with a lot of art, most of which is of a cub persona that likes to take it up the butt while secretly is an aging neckbeard that lives in his mother's basement.

The form of trolling affecting more Dragoneer remains so-called "Hate Art". It requires to draw his lovely [[fursona]] being injured or dead. If you wanna be permabanned, it's the only known way to get Dragoneer mad. For, drawing that purple dragon with yellow markings eating shit with a glass of piss, being raped by an hermaphrodite dinosaur, or raping a babyfur, or all of the above at the same time won't do. Other method consists to talk sincerely about the fandom at Tyra Banks show, or to purchase a [[fursuit|biofursuit]], specifying what it is made of.

===Carenath===
'''Carenath''' is the head administrator and server operator for the FurAffinity Forums. Recently, he found himself in the spotlight after he installed a vBulletin mod called "[http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=93258 Miserable Users]" and promptly put two of the most "controversial" FA Forums members in the group (see: those who did not provide enough asspats to [[Dragoneer]]). Everything would have been fine if he hadn't been fucking retarded and made sure no one knew the group existed. Instead, [[Fail|it was listed in the forum staff page]] and was [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/90871-Miserable-Users promptly discovered] by FA Forums users, who demanded to know what the users did wrong. Several other FA Forums staff members even questioned the installed mod. Carenath finally [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/90871-Miserable-Users?p=2343323#post2343323 admitted to it] and the community politely told him to [[GTFO]], which he responded to on Twitter:

{{quote|Also, I am not quitting, [[FYIAD|FUCK YOU]].|@Carnathziroth|http://twitter.com/#!/carenathziroth/status/32335924197064704}}

We should also add not even the FA Forums staff knew what was going on at first because Carenath didn't bother to tell them he installed the mod.

===Witchiebunny===
Witchiebunny is a [[Black|mad black woman]] who only became a FA admin because she was an admin on the [[TF2]] server that [[Dragoneer]] likes to play on. Her favorite word is [[FUCK]] and will ban you if you even think of disagreeing with her. Or if you call a poor, [[Slut|undeserving]] [[Woman|female]] [[artist]] a [[whore]][http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/90143-Was-permabanned-for-ban-evasion-which-I-did-not-commit.].

===Yak===
[[File:Yak.jpg|left|thumb|Yak, working on FA's code before stealing some <s>embryos</s> email addresses]]
'''Yak''' is a drunk [[Russian]] who claims to be FurAffinity's <s>lead</s> only developer, who despite claiming to know how to fix security holes, often adds new features riddled with the same holes that already exist in the site. He will then blame the "legacy" code, despite the new features being, well, ''new'' features. When he fixes the holes, the [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/86324-Hide-Comment-not-working feature will stop working]. If you ask him why he hasn't fixed the site yet, he will say he doesn't have the time. Instead of finding people that do have time, Dragonner refuses to add new staff and puts all his faith in Yak to fix the site.

==Former Staff==

===Arcturus Nova===
A self-confessed [[Otherkin]], he (or ''she'' as he prefers to be called) is the one who pays for the entirety of the server (a carefully nurtured facade, since the vast majority of these finances are actually donations from other users). Puts up with stress by whining about how all the other admins suck in the IRC chat, and also by randomly flipping out and kicking people for spelling his name wrong. Reportedly has a one-inch penis, and has posted [[n00dz|naked pictures]] of himself on the internet (which he refused to provide for this article). In July 2005, he broke down and [http://www.livejournal.com/community/furaffinity/47629.html started deopping the mods that couldn't spell], after which he was fired and resigned, lefting the community at the mercy of a complete [[retard]], Dragoneer.

===ArshesNei aka QTMelon===
Apparently also the mod of some tiny anime site, she was one of the only people who actually fixed bugs on the site. For this blatant trolling and disrespect towards the mods, she got her developer abilities taken away and her password changed so she could no longer access the site. Her enormous, cavernous [[vagina]] is still used as shelter for furries during the cold winter months. She is also [[black]]. She is also an EXPERT ARTIST with l33t skillz.

===Ozkangaroo===
(''This is just a small section. To read more about [[Oz Kangaroo]], go check out his article.'')

Some other generic background kangaroo-inflationist. Also managed to get comments turned off in news posts because of bad advice. One of the two mods who got shanked and lost his modship for about five hours before Jheryn came rushing in and banned half the mods.

===ChaseVRocket===
[[Image:Chase rocket.png|thumb|left|Aww, not even Fender/Rednef likes him.]][http://www.furaffinity.net/user/chase Chase ], (More like chase the red rocket, [[amirite?]]) a.k.a. Sean West (a sweaty fat fuck, for once we'll spare you the photos) is a notorious [[zoophile]] and has been recently [[promotions|promoted]] Administrator on FurAffinity by [[Dragoneer]] himself (being a fellow sweaty fat fuck), despite having made no contributions at all (More like, janitor, gallery director or at least moderator, since there's no hierarchy or any kind of organization in the staff, it's confusing). Chasevrocket always had a background where he defended the right to fuck animals, and supporting the idea that humans and animals both have sexual interests to share together. He admitted numerous times having a sexual relationship with a dog; and claims ''that every good pet lover should love their animals the same way animals love eachother, because we share the same biology and instincts.'' tl; dr : kill your mother, rape your dog.

He's proud to live in [[Florida]] where it's not illegal to finger your animal's sheath. 
note: he created a new account and left down [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/chasevrocket chasevrocket] in a miserable attempt to escape his zoophile past, kicking by the way the previous owner of the account "chase" on Furaffinity; because he's an Admin, thus blessed by the gods, and is righteous to repo the account "chase" for being owned by a lurker only.

Chase becoming a member of Furaffinity's staff allowed many confirmed [[zoophile]] activists to be unbanned, like Wildwulf for a couple of months before another moderator decides, according to the rants of numerous members to re-ban Wildwulf about one month after. Still, Barkwoof and Furrythriller have been clearly unbanned and encouraged to keep discretion, their infraction list cleared.

{{quote|I think we should enforce the "don't know - don't tell" policy about bestiality and the community as it just gives fuel to trolls, but keep a freedom of speech climate up on Fur Affinity, and banning people on their activities is pretty unfair to me.}}

{{quote|On FurAffinity we love animals.I think it's clear and we should not change our policy because some members yells at how it is morally wrong to have affinities with animals. It's hypocrite and I don't wanna play this game.}}

On January 4th, 2011, Chase announced he was no longer a FA admin (It is unlikely he was fired because Dragoneer does not have the [[balls]] to fire people). Free of any adminly responsibilities, he is now free to post things similar to what's already been talked about in this article.

===Kelli "[[Pinkuh]]" Davis===
[[Image:Pinkuh_sez.PNG|thumb|Pinkuh's [[fursona]], at least it's loud and clear, you gonna get [[B&]].]]
[[Pinkuh]] makes the rules on FurAffinity, her rules of course, not whatever the stupid admins wrote on the TOS. Dragoneer granted her a lifetime administrator status, so she can do whatever she wants on FurAffinity, including editing submissions, refueling dramas, banning anyone she doesn't like (art style better than hers, or political views.)
Note: any other admin/mod (Arshes, Glaide, Rhainor, or Yak) who would do a simple infringement to the official site's etiquette and [[rules]] would have been removed from the staff, and some were. [[Pinkuh]] performs many of the FA's TOS infringements on a weekly basis and doesn't afraid of anything! 
She knows too many bad things about Dragoneer, meaning she's untouchable. [[Enjoy your time protesting|Enjoy your furry website]]!
There is a more detailed article about this person [[Pinkuh|here]].
Rumor says Pinkuh's also partially responsible for turning furries [[gay]].

On Tuesday, January 18, 2011, Pinkuh resigned, and there was [[Orgy|much rejoicing]].


===Wolfblade===

{{squote|Wolfblade had been ingratiating himself with Jheryn and Jheryn once proposed that Wolfblade  be taken on staff as his "assistant", this was rejected. Wolfblade also ingratiated himself  with another admin, DragonMyr and DragonMyr proposed a vote to bring Wolfblade on as an  admin. The Vote was 1 in favour, 13 against IIRC. It was certainly decisively against it...

...Under circumstances which were never really made clear, Wolfblade was taken on staff as a  trial admin and then made a full admin, despite the originally vote against him. I think it  was [[Dragoneer|Preyfar]] arbitrarily deciding to do it.|Dave Hyena|recounting Wolfblade's induction as admin}}
[[Image:wolfbladeteddy.jpg|thumb|Yeah, okay then.]]

[http://www.furaffinity.net/user/wolfblade/ Wolfblade] (AKA Essayblade) is a dedicated Lulz hater who so hates controversy that he will destroy threads, delete journals and ban users at the slightest hint of “drama”. If ever two furfags with differing opinions cross paths, Wolfblade will be there to ban both of them. Wolfblade’s usual modus operandi is to first yell at anyone posting negative comments on another user’s journal or artwork, threatening to ban EVERYONE. And then to ban everyone, whether or not they’re posting anything negative.  And then to ban the original poster for “instigating drama”.

[[Image:Wolfblade-isn%27t-full-of-himself.jpeg|thumb|WOLFBLADE ISN'T FULL OF HIMSELF! STOP THE PRESS!]]

Wolfblade writes huge [[tl;dr]] posts to explain his fucktarded administrative decisions. Nobody has ever actually read through an entire Wolfblade post, but, if [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/143036/ this journal] is any indication, they mostly consist of butthurt crying about how mean trolls are and how no one appreciates his tireless efforts to kill the lulz and SHOULDN’T WE JUST BAN THEM ALL?? In replying to the ensuing deluge of comments, Wolfblade also expresses his fear that dreaded “troll packs” are running rampant throughout FA and frets: Won’t somebody think of the children?? Furfag sycophants overwhelmingly voice their support for harsher punishments against anyone looking for lulz, but a few lone dissenters stand out. True to form, Wolfblade accuses skeptical furfag Wraywolfe of being a troll:

  {squote|He's actually a prime example here. There's different types and levels of bothersome people in   
  the community, and he's a lower-level version of one of the most frustrating types: The ones who 
  start off civil, and rational, and seem to be making perfectly reasonable devil's-advocate 
  points. But who very quickly reveal that their primary interest in taking the opposing position 
  is that if they succeed in getting people to listen to them,  it keeps  the environment open for 
  the casual off-hand pattern of abuse and unnecessary insults they know they are a part of on 
  occasion, and don't want to get in trouble for. These types are the most frustrating because in 
  trying to defend the freedom of undesirable behavior, they initially demonstrate that they are 
  perfectly capable of behaving in a manner fitting a mature and non-hostile adult. They just 
  prefer to be free to choose not to.}}

Like all furfags, Wolfblade is in it for the porn... shitty gay Teddy Ruxpin porn. But don’t you dare point this out to Wolfblade, because he’s really sensitive about the fact that his cock loves a [[1980s]] interactive talking toy bear. If you do, he just might ban you. It’s no coincidence that while he threatened to ban everyone for mocking Ebon Lupus, the only people who actually got the [[banhammer]] all happened to lol at Wolfblade’s forbidden love. HOW CURIOUS.

[[Image:banworthy.jpg|thumb|A banworthy offense.]]

His hatred for drama also means that he totally flips out if people post anything on a user’s FA page after they’ve been banned, since in his mind this constitutes “kicking them when they’re down. Yet, Wolfblade himself loves to leave sarcastic comments behind after he’s kicked someone off the site; observe his very mature reaction during the [[Krystal Can’t Enjoy Her Sandwich]] saga.

===Dave Hyena===
[[Image:DaveHyena_at_work.png|thumb|This pictures sums all Dave's life.]]

'''DaveHyena''' was originally brought on board as a Trial Admin. His personality is filled with conservatism and puritanism, which makes Dave a god of hypocrisy for having some weird fetishes and a certain attraction to furry porn.

Due to his status of Trial Admin, Dave had to report policy violations, even the most insignificant ones (incl. fanart with copyrights not in the description, pictures above 1280x1280, mature content in a furry site) to one of the real admin staff so they could take action. If [[lazy|no action was taken]], Dave didn't let down and contacted another admin until his work has been recognized and the user banned. Everybody hates him.

Rumors are circulating that he owns multiple accounts to report PV's on FurAffinity or even troll FurAffinity users, then [[ban]] his own trollings accounts, and blame [[Anonymous]], and once again, DaveHyena saves the day!

Additionally, Dave owns an account on deviantART where he posted some of his [[Shitty art|artworks]]. Acting like a troll and harassing multiple users, especially furries with both a dA and FA account, he finally got [[banned]]. Anyway, the reasons which force him into acting this way remains unknown. Today, he posts on [[USI]] central, aka [[Cyd#Vivisector|Vivisector]] as "[[You're a bird|a snow pigeon]]". While a little overly obsessed with Dragoneer, more often than not the shit that he digs up is pretty good, including his recounting of [http://forums.vivisector.org/index.php/topic,193.msg1523.html#msg1523 his time as admin] and [http://forums.vivisector.org/index.php/topic,193.msg1524.html#msg1524 his view of the site staff], along with some delicious drama they were involved in.

===LexyEevee===
[[File:Eeveen.jpg|thumb|left|Dragoneer accuses Eevee of being the reason Ferrox failed, and not because Dragoneer is horrible at communicating in anything other than memes.]]
'''[http://www.furaffinity.net/user/lexyeevee/ LexyEevee]''' or just '''[[Pokemon|Eevee]]''' was the lead [[Script kiddie|developer]] for the Ferrox project before he [[Quitting the internet|quit]] after he realized what he was working on:
{{quote|Every time I sit down to work on Ferrox, I wonder why I am helping to provide a product that I know will be used to advance practices I strongly disagree with. I wonder why I am wasting my time on users who will cheerfully get snarky with me and accuse me of reshaping FA in my image because I don't want to implement a backwards feature that I think is fundamentally a bad idea. Many people close to me wonder the same and have told me I should just bail; I don't have very good excuses to give them.|Eevee}}

In late 2010 Eevee released a list of security vulnerabilities in the site code. This caused much [[butthurt]] amongst FA administration who were faced with having to do work.

==Cub Art Ban==
FurAffinity has in the past attempted or discussed banning '''cub art''', art depicting characters who are clearly [[loli|minors in sexual situations]].
===Fur Wars: The Pedobear Menace===
''See also: [[The Great FurAffinity Exodus of 2006]]''

[[2005|Five years ago]] [[sick fuck|legitimate artists]] began submitting their art to FurAffinity. Some of these masterpieces depicted [[children| juvenile]] furries doing what furries do best – [[yiffing]]! Unfortunately this broke the [http://www.furaffinity.net/lm/tos/ Terms of Service] of FurAffinity which disallows “Clearly underdeveloped sexual characteristics for the species being represented, either by comparison to other characters in the depiction, or other 'well known' characters”, but no one seemed to noticed, possibly because they were [[masturbation|appreciating]] these [[Shitty art|high caliber pieces of art]]. Due to the lack of policy enforcement it was quickly assumed by users that [[pedophilia|pedofurria]] did not fall under the Terms of Service agreement.

Then [[last Thursday]] a group of [[Common knowledge|closed-minded]] [[People|individuals]] found the depiction of underage furries to be disgusting and pointed out that the Terms of Service forbid such submissions. [[Nazi Furs|Furry Hitler]], the administrator and owner of FurAffinity, sided with these individuals and began [[fursecute|fursecuting]] all the poor pedofurs on the site.

Down, but not out, the pedofurs rose up together and [[circle jerk|rallied]] their [[bullshit|plight]], since everyone knows that drawing underage [[penis]] is a legitimate form of art and [[lie|freedom of expression]]. See: [[zeriara]], a popular pedo. Soon the ranks of the pedofurs rose until they stood strong and defiant against the administration. [[erectile dysfunction|Bowing]] to the [[in the ass|public pressure]], Furry Hitler decided to run a public poll that was [[Bullshit|unbiased]] in order to decide whether or not to ban pedofurria art.

Many users [[butthurt|threatened]] [[The Great FurAffinity Exodus of 2006|to leave FurAffinity]] 4ever if the ban was passed, and many of the [[Common knowledge|closed-minded]] individuals who illegitimately [[fursecuted|fursecute]] the poor pedofurs also similarly threatened to [[Flounce|leave FurAffinity 4ever]] if the works of [[Shitty art|art]] were allowed.

On the 5th of November, 2006, [[bullshit|justice]] finally prevailed and pedofurria was DENIED on FurAffinity and all the Furfags rejoiced in a [[circle jerk|celebration]] with the audience of JEWS and Trent Reznor. OR WAS IT?! Lol no, it wasn't. [http://web.archive.org/web/20070111083224/http://www.nothingkat.com/downloads/FALog110606.txt Dragoneer decided to revert that rule] even though [[Denial|HE TOTALLY HATES CUB ART]].

===Fur Wars: The Pedobear Strikes Back===

On December 14, 2007 Fender/Dragoneer opened up a contest in his [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/258765/ journal] for new donation buttons. The winner of the contest by a landslide was ediskrad for his [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/901120/ Will Drop Pants 4 Bandwidth] submission. Much [[drama]] and [[lulz]] ensues after a furry known as Mottenfest called out on the button, calling it cub art.  Other furs follow his path, saying that because ediskrad's gallery is full of cub porn must mean that the button contains cub as well. Ediskrad retaliates, saying that the button was based from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', while calling the protesting furs "Fucking..Furry..r/tards."  Some furs have even gone so far as to threaten leaving FurAffinity forever if the donation button were used.

===Fur Wars: Return of the Banhammer===
[[File:Cp.png|left|thumb]]On November 20, 2010 FA administrator Witchiebunny took to [[LiveJournal]] to attempt to [[fail|subtly]] warn [[Pedophile|cub art enthusiasts]] that a upcoming change in policy would be banning cub art. Again. Naturally said enthusiasts [[Diaperfur|shit their pants]] at the news and began to [[Bawww|baaaaaawwwwwww]] all over the [[internet]]. Notorious cub art lover and former FA admin Wolfblade [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1882390/ called out] FurAffinity over the proposed ban (along with the "leak"), which Dragoneer quickly replied to in private [[Pussy|because he didn't want over 9000 angry furry pedophiles coming after him]].

[[image:Banningpedoisthoughtcrime.jpg|thumb|left|Fursecution is exactly like waterboarding dissidents, rite?]]
[[image:Betawolfbawww.png|thumb|right|Typical QQ journal by many babyfurs/pedophiles]]
On the 24th of November 2010, [[Dragoneer]] anounced that the [[Canada|Canadians]] at AlertPay dropped FA after [[Allan|someone]] [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/87380-The-New-Policy-on-Cub?p=2261295&viewfull=1#post2261295 reported the cub art on the site] and AlertPAy [[WIN|seized the thousands of dollars in the account]], so [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/87380-The-New-Policy-on-Cub Dragoneer bawwwed about it] in an FA thread with [[troll|guaranteed replies]]. The policy was put in place in hopes AlertPay would return their [[jewgolds]] 90 days later. Dragoneer was yet again flaunting his closeted babyfurfaggotry by threatening to ban anyone flaming cub artists.

[[Oxymoron|Sane furries]] everywhere rejoiced due to this change, however cub artists and other babyfurs were completely buttmad to the point of accusing AlertPay of [[fursecution]] and apparently illegal activities out of pure [[butthurt|asspain]]. Some people are simply not getting it, and are [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/87380-The-New-Policy-on-Cub?p=2262379&viewfull=1#post2262379 bawwwwwwwwwing] about the [[Nazi|Cub porn Holocaust]] that is approaching.

===Fur Wars: Return of the Banhammer Part 2.5===
About a week and a half after the original pedo porn ban announcement, [[Pinkuh]] appeared and [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/87584-Sonic-Character-Ages?p=2282176&viewfull=1#post2282176 banned] [[Sonic]] porn along with any other characters that were under age 18 according to their respective [[Shit nobody cares about|cannon]] even though these do not look like children. This caused even more [[butthurt]] and more [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1920986/ artists] to abandon the sinking FA ship.  She also announced by flawless logic that characters like Shippo whose canon age is 50 is banned due to him looking childlike[http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/88335-A-clarification-on-sonic-underage?p=2286682&viewfull=1#post2286682].

==Other Drama and Events==
Being run by and full of [[furries]], FurAffinity is overflowing with sweet, sweet [[drama]] at all times.

===Allan===
''Main article: [[Allan]]''<br>
'''Allan''' used FurAffinity to gain e-fame by commissioning thousands of dollars in art commissions, before running out of money and begging the furries for more. At this point, Dragoneer [[Banhammer|permabanned]] his ass, the one correct thing Dragoneer has done as FA admin.

Allan returned a couple times using [[socks]] and was quickly banned. In October 2010, Allan [[Allan#Vengeance_is_Futile|caused a lot of drama]] by sending FA and FA's host a couple DMCA notices.

<s>Allan is currently spending his time as a political tool used by Dragoneer and other popufurs to whip up the slobbering furry masses against something other than their own faggotry and incompetence.</s> Disregard that, Dragoneer has [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/83972-Someone-enlighten-me-on-the-sudden-quot-threats-of-Allen-against-FA-quot?p=2234578&viewfull=1#post2234578 learned that he needs to stop fanning the flames] and is no longer going to make a public spectacle of dealing with Allan. We expect everything to return to normal next time Allan sends a DMCA.

===Chewfox===
''Main article: [[Chewfox]]''<br>
'''Chewfox''' is a furfag who appeared on Tyra Banks talk show and admitted that the furry fandom was pretty much all about [[sex]]. Once the episode aired, all the [[MILF|soccer moms]] who were watching and wanted to know more jumped on [[Google]] and found their way to FA, which of course crashed. This caused [[Dragoneer]] to rage and ban Chewfox for something completely unrelated to the site. He later admitted to overreacting and unbanned Chewfox, only to ban her once again when she made fun of the incident on a shirt she wore to a furry convention. Chewfox currently holds the record for being banned from FA for things that didn't even happen on the site.

==Downtime/Hacking==
FurAffinity is notorious for long periods of downtime, both planned and unplanned. Often they will work their equipment until it fails because they don't monitor it and because even if they did, because driving all the way to the datacenter is such ''hard work''. 

==="Augustgate"===
Despite taking place in mostly in July, '''Augustgate''', as it was dubbed by [[Dragoneer]], was FurAffinity's longest downtime to date, lasting from July 1st, 2008 to August 5th, 2008. The site was taken offline on July 1st (Odd that these things wait until the first of the month. You could almost say it was... scheduled...) due to a unidentified "hardware failure". Immediately Dragoneer started [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/22182-Server-Hardware-Fault requesting donations] and within 7 days the furfags forked over [[Over 9000|$18,000]] to fix the site. Dragoneer then showed off his IT knowledge and ordered a HP ProLiant server before the community told him that those use special hard drive sleds which would drain FurAffinity of their [[jew gold]], to which he responded by ordering a Dell along with a new database server (Which wasn't a Dell, and which also required expensive hard drive sleds). 

In 2011, thanks to the efforts of a former administrator, a number of selections from chat logs from the FA staff IRC channel were made public. These chat logs show that, not only was the staff aware of the problem long before it ever became a problem, they were planning to buy a new server anyways and just needed a [[Scam|reason to convince the community to fork over a couple thousand dollars]].
{{squote|Hyenafire: Tsa found a flaw with the NIC card on the main WWW server<br>

===2009 outages===
On July 29th [[God|lightning]] knocked out power to the datacenter FurAffinity is located in, and the facility's backup power [[Fail|did not activate automatically]], thus knocking FurAffinity's servers offline. Not bothering to investigate, FA admins Carenath and [[Pinkuh]] [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/History_of_Fur_Affinity#cite_note-10 accused several members of a FA IRC channel] for hacking the site and promptly [[banned]] them. Later, when everyone found out the power had just gone out, said users were unbanned, and of course, nothing happened to Carenath and Pinkuh.

Two months later on November 30th, the site went offline again because of a "[http://community.livejournal.com/furaffinity/211143.html broken fiber-optic cable]". The site was then offline for a week before it moved to a new datacenter. There have been many reports that this was a [[lie]] since there was no report of a broken cable in the area, and other sites hosted by the datacenter were still online, and that FA's contract had simply been terminated or they had failed to pay their bills. Given the administrator's habitual lying, which story do YOU believe?

===2010: [[Wikileaks|Furryleaks]]===

On December 16th [[over 9000|over 1 million]] passwords were leaked from [http://lifehacker.com/5712785/ Kotaku] onto the vast internets, creating great amounts of lulz as [[Dragoneer]] and [[Pinkuh]] were included among them, allowing [[nigras|hackers]] [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/89027-Thumbnails-and-Other-Issues-Morning-Thursday-Dec-16-2010?p=2303593&viewfull=1#post2303593 hiding behind] [[7 proxies]] to break in and fuck up their shit. [[Dragoneer]] immediately shut down the site claiming an admin account was violated due to the leak, not noting any names.

[[BILLY MAYS|BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!!!]]. The very next day the hackers returned for round two, using an exploit they installed the day before but nobody ever noticed. The hackers then proceeded to deadmin every one of the admins, unhide the Admin forums, declare [[Pinkuh]] dead, create a few journals, wipe a number of galleries, and release a few notes. <s>Hopefully more will be released soon in a lulz-filled data dump that will put the [[Gawker]] dump and [[Wikileaks]] to shame.</s> [http://filesmelt.com/dl/Dragoneers_Notes.7z Dragoneer's notes for the past 3+ years], with much delicious drama, along with the notes for [http://filesmelt.com/dl/Pinkuh.rar Pinkuh], [http://filesmelt.com/dl/Zaush.rar Adam Wan/Zaush],  both of [http://filesmelt.com/dl/chase.7z Chase's] [http://filesmelt.com/dl/Chasevrocket.rar accounts] and [http://filesmelt.com/dl/Silver_and_Aurora.rar SilverAutomatic and AuroraBorealis] have been released so far, with more to come.

Even though Dragoneer pretty much blamed everyone else for the prevention of the attack on his shitty site (which by this time, took 64GB of RAM to process a page because of the wonderful backend coding) everyone will continue using FurAffinity until the day it finally dies. Sadly, the odds of this happening are equivalent to it being the year of the [[Linux]] desktop.

To compensate for the leaking of the many notes, Dragoneer sent every victim a Sponsor invite to his shitty furcon. This was only worth $75 and didn't include travel costs. What a dumbshit.

==FA Facts==
* Although you can get banned for calling someone else a [[whore]], FA's [https://www.furaffinity.net/login/ login form] contains a hidden value called [[Politically_correct|"retard_protection"]].
* The database schema is royally fucked, the design (or lack thereof) is worse than your average community college web-design tard. For example, users are identified by their actual username instead of a unique number like in every other website ever, which leads to fun things like not being able to delete user accounts and not being able to rename them. The private message system suffered from similar retardery; only one copy of a message existed in the whole system, so you could not delete sent messages or it would disappear from the recipient's inbox. This was redesigned [[last Thursday]], but only after a number of popular artists made enough fuss about it.
* The internal server network uses routable IP addresses, and there is other evidence of complete cluelessness in the network design—for example, facdn.net would mean to a normal person: FurAffinity Content Distribution Network. But it is one box with one IP.[http://forums.vivisector.org/index.php/topic,255.0.html]
* Due to the above-mentioned furaffinity.net/facdn.net data/app server split, there is no way to prevent people from viewing adult images directly as cookies are not automatically passed across these domains and no redirect scheme exists.
* If you access the site directly via its [http://70.33.186.196 IP address], no images from facdn.net will load because the [[Retard|geniuses]] who programmed the hotlink prevention forgot to add themselves to the whitelist.
* The registration system was a complete disaster, no verification whatsoever was made of user signups, which was extremely vulnerable to spammers and [[4chan|other quality influences]]. Registration was disabled for more than half a year before it was restored with Captcha and Email Activation. But was still a waste of [[at least 100 years ago|6 months]] of effort because they have yet to learn how to block disposable emails. Or if you're [[autistic|that fucking clever]] you can use your same email over and over.
* Whereas most websites use some kind of design pattern such as model-view-controller, FA is a clusterfuck of PHP shat out by some 18-year-old [[fat|fat fuck]]. It is very fragile and even simple changes that would require little if any testing could fuck it up. This is why they tested what was basically a new style sheet for months on end, giving it a code name "sigma" like it was some major upgrade.
