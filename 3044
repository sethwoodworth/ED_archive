Foshata

'''Foshata''' was [[allegedly]] a form of entertainment, although this fact has been disputed by many. Since the [[American]] entertainment industry is currently run by [[Scientology|Scientologists]], [[Some argue|others argue]] that this exclusion is a positive thing.

Foshatas were [[Japanese]] commercials, which have spaces to add fake subtitles. These are then filled in by [[Japanophiles|Foshatists]]. The site is now defunct as of [[Last thursday|January 2007]]

== About Foshata ==

Foshatists are an enigma. They are either [[Racist]] [[Hate|Haters]] of [[Japan]], or [[Japanophiles]]. Although they have no discernible writing skills, they take great pride in [[Grammar Nazi|criticizing others]] for their lack of aforementioned ability, and of voting "[[Funny|good]]" or "[[Unfunny|bad]]" depending on their mood, and whether or not they got [[Sex|laid]] that day ([[The Virginmobile|they didn't]]). The second best way to piss off a foshatist is to write with [[Leet|poor grammar]], and the best way is to criticize his/her's- Oh, let's be fully honest here, it's definitely "his", as [[women]] don't engage in this sort of behavior. If you want to pick up chicks, go to a disco. In [[At least 100 years ago|1977]].

The [http://foshata.com/?fsh=6S6 typical foshata] talks about [[World of Warcraft|WoW]]. It also isn't [[Unfunny|very funny]]. But if you look hard enough, you can definitely find some diamonds in the [[BDSM|rough]]. And if you think you can do better, go for it, you [[noob]]. Because I am going to vote your [[ass]] down so fast...I mean you should definitely check it out.

Sashes have a prominent place in foshatas, although no one seems to know why. There has been talk of foshata [[cosplay]], but since no one will admit to being a part of this discussion, it has gone no further as of yet.

Other topics include [[Rape]], [[abortion]], [[pedophilia]], [[incest]], [[unwarranted self-importance]], [[In the ass|taking it in the ass]] and [[Your mom|your mother]]. Yes, they talk about various aspects of your mother's [[body]] and sexual [[Unbirthing|proclivities]] on foshata.com, so it would be in your best interest to go check it out [[now|immediately]].

== Foshata Blanks ==
There isn't really a word for the commercials that are [[rape]]d by Foshata [[user]]s, so from now on they are called "blanks" refering to the minds of those creating them. The Foshata website offers [[at least 100]] different commercials, but doesn't supply them with names, so these are categorised by vague descriptions.

=== The one with the girl on a phone ===
This one line Foshata blank allows for a variety of Foshata, ranging from [[your mom|witty puns about one's mother]] to [[All your base are belong to us|ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US !?!]][http://foshata.com/?fsh=IQ6]. The expression on the girl's face really does fit with many different [[bukkake|situations]]. This was used in the [[Foshata#The hermaphrodite being banged up the ass|first foshata]] on the new site.[http://foshata.com/?fsh=1]

=== The Japanese family ===
Not even devoted Foshatists can find anything funny with anything done with this one. 

=== The one with the chicks in windows ===
Scientists have yet to discover what the hell they are on about, so here is some [http://foshata.com/?fsh=IY0 random shit with lesbians].

=== The office scene ===
Some guy says something to some other guy and then some [[16 year old Japanese schoolgirl]] comes in, often ends with a sexual reference.[http://foshata.com/?fsh=H4C]

=== The hermaphrodite being banged up the ass ===
[[Meatspin.com]] was the first Foshata to ever be created. The message chosen "YOU ARE OFFICIALLY [[gay|GAY]] :-)" is now traditional for each Foshatist to put use in their first Foshargy.

=== Your mom ===
[[Your mom]] is a foshata, go write random shit on her with a sharpie.
