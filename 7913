Superdemon-Inuyasha is a self-proclaimed "extremely homophobic" [[weeaboo]] [[fangirl]] in love with [[Inuyasha]]. She says, "I HATE Non-canon [[yaoi]] and [[Lesbian|yuri]]", marking her a strange bird even by fangirl standards (read: not even her own kind wants her). However, like all the other [[retard]]ed weeaboos, much of her time is spent watching drivel and [[Roman Shower|regurgitating]] it upon [[DeviantArt|the internet]] for all to feast upon, with the spice of [[Icon theft|copying artwork and stealing characters]] thrown in to [[Chris Hansen|tempt and invite]] the [[troll|viewer]]. She also admittedly [[Semen|comes]] from Texas. Only two things come from Texas: Steers and Superdemon-Inuyasha.

[[7chan]] [[hate|love]]s her, and she got [[lol]]fully [[phish]]ed in January 2007, much to the [[win|loss]] of everybody.


==Theft and Tracing==

Superdemon-Inuyasha created a series of [[srsly]] [[original character]]s, much like any [[weeaboo]] [[art]]ist. She created such creative masterpieces as [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/16350175/ Darigaaz] the not-at-all inspired by [http://www.cardkingdom.com/images/Invasion/DarigaaztheIgniter.jpg a magic card] character. But it's okay! [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/16350175/640947516 Magic the Gathering is totally not copyrighted by anyone] which means Superdemon-inuyasha did not steal and is not a thief!!

Of course, she has many more original characters, like <s>[http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/19550979/?qo=137&q=by%3Asuperdemon-inuyasha&qh=sort%3Atime+-in%3Ascraps Inutaru]</s> (BALEETED!!!11) who is NOT INUYASHA!!!! This is Superdemon-inuyasha's CHARACTER, for Superdemon-inuyasha's ANIME!!! Note the differences!!!!

Also just so everybody knows, [[anime]] no longer means anything animated. It now means the terrible ramblings of a weeaboo [[fanfic]].

Having [[moar]] than one reason to attack a DevianTARTlet makes raids even better. Whilst the original raids held against Superdemon-Inuyasha were under the [[rainbow]] banner, it wasn't long before [[anonymous]] discovered that Superdemon-Inuyasha was also an art thief. They looked upon the theft and they knew that there was [[lulz]] ahead.

Superdemon-Inuyasha has quite a huge gallery, so there was enough theft and lulz for all. Like most DevianTARTlet art thieves, Superdemon-Inuyasha does not respond very well to being called a tracer. By the magic of cause and effect, this made the [[internets]] accuse her of art-theft even [[moar]].

{{squote|I just want to die…or leave DA if this problem persists…It’s getting stupid… That deviation  means a lot to me and so does my sig, so I refuse to remove either… please…If more people report them or whatever they might ban them and It’ll all be ok….please…help… *starts crying*….I can’t take much more of this….| SuperDemon-Inuyasha}}

===Carboning===

[[Image:Superdemon.jpg|thumb| GRIDS and CARBONING.  Not tracing.  God. How many times does she have to TELL YOU THIS?!?!]]
[http://comments.deviantart.com/4/1473199/360168569 Superdemon's testimony] reveals that she uses "grid referencing" and a "time cunsuming process called "Carboning"." lol, [[Fucktard|dumbass]].

Grids are a good exercise for beginning students. It is the act of drawing a grid over a preexisting picture and recopying it square by square. The grid method is [http://www.portrait-artist.org/basics/newbie3.html  "..a very encouraging drawing tool—but it should be used as a stepping stone to help you develop additional drawing skills",] not the way one should keep drawing says this educational website. However, Superdemon disagrees, maintaining that it [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/1473199/355861236  "takes YEARS of practice." ] She also states that lots of respected artists use grids. This is partially true:
Seasoned artists often use grids to make a larger version of their own work. All merit is lost when this technique is used to copy art from another artist. Grids copying other people's works are for fags who refuse to work harder at their art skills (or lack thereof). And when you post a grid picture on [[deviantART]], you're a [[retard]].

[[Shit nobody cares about|One might not be familiar with Superdemon-Inuyasha's use of the word carboning. "Carboning" is a technique where one uses carbon paper to transfer the lines of a drawing onto a fresh sheet of paper. First you put the carbon paper face down on a blank sheet of regular paper. Then you put another drawing you want to transfer on top of the back of the carbon paper. Press down hard as you '''TRACE ALONG THE LINES''' of the original drawing, so that the carbon paper transfers it's pigment onto the blank sheet below. It's the easiest way to trace.]] 

Again, Superdemon says it's okay because respected artists use this method.
And yet again... Real artists use it when they want to transfer a sketch they did themselves to nicer paper. Only hacks use it to copy other people's [[Shit|work]]. 

{{squote|T.T eh.... I DON'T trace though.... -.-0 [[Lies|It takes YEARS of practice]] to grid out, and draw a picture as good I do (which I DON'T think is that great anyways...as for my other art o.o...... well.... @.@ I've just been drawing for a REALLY long time, lol ^-^0| SuperDemon-Inuyasha}}

{{squote|..my art IS Authentic and [[Lies|I spend hours and hours - even DAYS]] working on one piece of art, which is why I don't post that often, and when I do post a lot - It's usually after a month or two of 0 postings... -.-0| SuperDemon-Inuyasha [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/1473199/364235631]}}

==Homophobia==

One of the main reasons the [[internets]] dislike Superdemon-Inuyasha is because of her hatred of the [[gay]]s - as you know, the best way to work a mob of virgin [[13-year-old girl]]s into a frothing rage is to call them the [[fag hag]]s that they are.

Because hating gay people is [[God hates fags|awright]]. As a particularly eloquent [[/b/tard]] put it;

{{squote|The fact that you honestly think that the people who bashed this person are gay really says a lot about your personality. People like you have no right calling others close minded. Some people blame everything on Jews, some blame black people, you blame yaoi fans and gay people. You and this user are so blinded by hate that is almost humorous. But I'm a little surprised that she didn't delete my comment about the bible.
<br /><br />
PS. They flamed her for being a tracer and art thief.|[http://comments.deviantart.com/4/1473199/350152547 SuperDemon-Retard]}}

Many strikes of [[gay|logic]] were tried against Superdemon-Inuyasha, but as always, the greatest were those without. 7chan made a call for pictures of Superdemon-inuyasha's characters engaged in acts of [[faggot tree|faggot]]ry to be created, and much [[lulz]] were had by all.


{{squote|I've been getting harassed by Yaoi/yuri fangirls and the like, because of my signature and that fact that I'm homophobic - which, btw, part of the reason why I can't tolerate homosexuallity - Is because it's against my [[Insane|religion]] as well.|SuperDemon-Inuyasha}}

{{squote|God, I really DO have a lot of reasons to hate them (homosexuals).... I should make a list one day.... (not including some NICE homosexuals I know here on DA and one I know in real life - But to me, as a genral rule, Most of them AREN'T nice people - Just look at the people harassing me - a big bulk of them ARE homosexual)| SuperDemon-Inuyasha}}

{{squote|People like the ones harrassing me have done this before outside of the internet - especially by two individual people, which has actually caused me to HATE most homosexuals just because most of them that I've met - act JUST like these flamers, sometimes, even worst. I've been putting up with it for almost 4 years now.| SuperDemon-Inuyasha [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/9120293/275114069]}}

Actually, Superdemon-Inuyasha hates non-canon [[yaoi]] and [[lesbian|yuri]] artwork, meaning works which put two straight characters into a homosexual situation. Whether this is fine or not is up to the rest of the [[Internets]].

==Fangirlism at it's finest==
[[Image:Original_Hitler.jpg|thumb|Superdemon-Inuyasha is a big fan of Hitler!]]

<s>[http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/16909431/ This proves it.]</s> REJECTED!

Basically (before the deletion), it was a little slip of paper that was signed by Inuyasha's voice actor (who doesn't own Inuyasha, but merely voices him [[Bullshit|WHICH IS TOTALLY JUST AS GOOD AMIRITE]]), [[Dick|Richard]] Ian [[Cock|Cox]], whom she met at an anime convention. The paper said:

{{squote|Inuyasha belongs to Steph (you).|What is said to be Richard Ian Cox, Inuyasha's voice actor, NOT THE OWNER}}

She probably wrote it herself since she's a [[batshit insane]] slut who will never get laid and claimed it was indeed Inu's VA. We may NEVAR know, but all we do know is that it might have been [[Deleted|BALEETED]] shortly after or during the raid against her and the hacking of her account.

[[Image:Flaming_inu.jpg|thumb|right|The bitch gets flamed for great Justice.]]
After stumbling upon the article, Inuretard was going to do some [[ED:VIP|vandalism]]. But using your dA username while doing so is hard core stupidity.
[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Superdemon-Inuyasha&diff=1997035481&oldid=1997035479]

Finally a [[An hero|brave troll]] went against SuperDemon and opened a website based on her faggotry.

===SuperDemon-Inuyasha vs. Nillia===

DA user Nillia pitied the fanbrat, and offered her some advice. She explained why she thought people were so offended, and said that the first step might be for Superdemon to remove her signature. 

{{squote|Why was my comment removed? It was civil and just trying to help, really...|Nillia}}

'''Superdemon gave a [[tl;dr]] explanation, proving once an for all that she is simply a [[16 year old girl|mature]] [[emo|victim]]:'''

{{squote|Sorry, If you didn't read my warning post - I'm removing any comments put on my page that has to do with the said subject.

I read the first line - If it's negatively on the subject - I remove it without even reading the while thing.
<BR><BR>
and if it's from ANY of the [[lol wut|radiers]], etc - I don't ever read it, I remove it.
<BR><BR>
[[Stop calling me a homo|I'm sick of people spaming my page.]]
<BR><BR>
It's happened WAY too many times, and I'm no longer tolerating it.
<BR><BR>
I simplily want to draw and enjoy my time hear on DA - but I can't with people harassing me about things I didn't do.
<BR><BR>
The first time this happen (the harassment) Someone [[lol wut |acused me of being a MURDER of gays]] - all because I don't like yaoi/yuri art.
<BR><BR>
Things like that hurt, and now, [[Truth |I'm apparently not an artist anymore]], and I can "Trace" photographs and OC'S that have never been seen before.
<BR><BR>
Then all my "Fanart" , etc is traced because I used refs - WHICH IS STATED RIGHT ON THE PAGE.
<BR><BR>
[[Common Sense |DA is an art community.]]
<BR><BR>
Not a hangout for "cyber bullies" etc.
<BR><BR>
I'm sorry if your comment was trying to help - but I'm TRYING to get rid of all the crap on my page, and as soon as I knew it was about what was going on, and you were agreeing with them, I just deleted it, like all the others because I've sick of reading the same thing Over and over.
<BR><BR>
[[Lies |I don't trace my art - I work very hard on it]], and even though I don't like my art and think it's crap anyways - I DON'T except being told I don't put any effort into what I do and rip off other work.
<BR><BR>
If you think [[truth |using refs is "tracing"]] then tell that to the hundreds of fanartists here on DA alone. I'm sure they will be please to know that.
<BR><BR>
I'm not trying to be rude - I'm trying to make a point and get through to at LEAST one person. Since only other artists who use the same style as me and friends of mine that WATCH me draw every piece of art I do and people that actually KNOW me in real life, etc - realize and understand how hard I work on my art - many of which yell at me for saying I hate it and I'm not as good as them.
<BR><BR>
I also find it a little unfair that you and so many other are harassing JUST me - and not [[shit nobody cares about|artists out there that do NOTHING BUT fanart draw from screencaps and other pictures, etc]]
<BR><BR>
[[Lies|Most of my pictures are of OC'S - make by ME and are coperighted to ME.]]
<BR><BR>
[[Truth|Yet EVERYTHING I do is apparently "Traced"]] according to many of you.
<BR><BR>
Do you see how frustrating that is?
<BR><BR>
Just try ONCE to see things the way I'm seeing them right now.
<BR><BR>
just imagine working for a week or so - HOURS a day on ONE piece of fanart for someone, that you used a ref for.
<BR><BR>
Then, when you finally have it done, and are at least a BIT happy about the way it turned out - but NEVER want to draw them again because it took so long and was SO hard to do.
<BR><BR>
Someone says "You traced that! Your no artist!!! Go die in hell!!!" etc, etc, etc - the list goes on with what I've heard.
<BR><BR>
Then when you try to reason with the people saying it - they start harrassing you day after day, and won't leave you alone until you either leave DA or "die in hell".
<BR><BR>
That is why I'm getting rid of all the comments I see that are upsetting/frustrating or just plain stupid, or the same people bugging me over and over. [[Constructive Criticism|And now, bu this point - any comment that isn't a friend of mine, of someone being friendly.]]|SuperDemon-Inuyasha [[TL;DR]]}}

==Hacked and Banned==

[[Image:Sd-inu phish.jpg|thumb|"it isnt her OMG PEOPLE SCREW OFF SHE WOULD NEVER EVER COPY SOMETHING EVER D:"]]

On the 24th of January (or the 23rd, lol timezones), Superdemon-Inuyasha's account was OMG HAXXED (see: [[phish]]ed) by an [[anonymous|unknown party]]. This entrepreneuring young [[winrar]] threw up a very lulzy journal on Superdemon-Inuyasha's account that has a link to a website showing how SDI has been tracing all her [[shit|artwork]], and owned up to being a mean ol' [[icon theft|art thief]]. <s>[[http://superdemon-inuyasha.deviantart.com/journal/11540093/ Partake in the lulz.]]</s> GONE.

ED Analysts predict that it could be just a mere few months before the fast acting dA moderators review the reports and ban Superdemon-Inuyasha.

dA faggot admins RESTORE Superdemon-Inuyasha's account, ignoring proof that she steals artwork and banning users who only wanted justice, leading users to believe that Superdemon-Inuyasha is in fact a dA admin sock who is posting ripped artwork for the lulz. 

[[Image:Superdemon-Inuyasha gets the B&hammer.png|thumb|It's beautiful...]]
dA faggot admins actually do their job and [[B&]] Superdemon-Inuyasha. The cause of this is most likely [[divide by zero|division by zero]] because of the odds of this actually happening because they felt like doing their job are actually less than the odds that [[Anonymous]] will get laid in the near future.
