'''DeadJournal''' is a [[LiveJournal]] clone for [[goth]]s.  While its [[LJ TOS|Terms of Service]] are significantly more relaxed than those of LJ, it's also poorly run, so if the site [[fellatio|goes down]], good luck. Generally not worth the effort, unless you enjoy [[troll]]ing. DeadJournal is a hot bed for [[emo|people who self harm]], [[fag|goths]] and [[Basement-dweller|people who hate the world along with everyone and everything in it]]. Also Full of TwilightFags Or Tween Girls that wish they were Vampires.
