'''Smogon [[Special Education|University]]''' is a online competitive community that that was created [[Last Thursday|in the year 2004]] and is [[THE BEST|the most widely-accepted]] competitive website for online battlers everywhere. This website is lurking with [[No life|basement-dwelling Pokéfans]]  that are  [[Dying Alone|desperate for battles and very lonely]] and they overcome this by contacting  other [[Nerds|Smogonites]] and engaging  in [[buttsecks|battles]]. Most of the competitive Pokémon players on this site are too stupid to realize that a battle that is almost entirely luck-based and can never be even remotely considered competitive and [[Irony|all of them use 'legit' hacks]].


==How it all started==
[[File:Smogon rage.png|thumb|right|300px]]
[[Image:obeseman.jpg|thumb|Typical Smogonite-In-Training]]
[[Last Thursday|A long time ago,]] there was this bored and lonely [[Basement dweller|Pokéfan]] known as [[Retard|Brainman]] who decided to create a new [[IRC]] channel, which he named Smogon, which is the [[German]] name for Koffing. After a while, the chat rooms full of [[No life|lifeless Smogonfags]] grew large in size and became a website in which [[Segregation|Pokémon are placed in categories]] known as [[Bullshit|Tiers]]. While people believe that Smogon is a "[[friend]]ly" and "[[Fox News|Fair and Balanced]]" Pokémon battling community, it is nothing more than a [[mantrain]] of [[Crybaby|whiny, bitching]] Poké-[[tourneyfag]]s who impose unnecessary restrictions, bans all your favorite items and Pogéymanz, and requires you to "[[Rape|breed you Pokémon and EV-train them]]" (ironically, [[Lazy|most Smogonfags use legit hacks rather than raising Pogeymanz on their own]]). Despite all these retarded rules, Pokéfags actually buy this shit and go along with it, as if they were obsessed [[Twitards]] joining the [[Twilight]] bandwagon.

==Rules==
===The Battle system===
[[TL;DR|The Evasion Clause (in which Minimize and Double Team are banned as well as the abilities Snow Cloak and Sand Veil), Freeze Clause (in which two Pokémon are not allowed to be frozen), Sleep Cluse (in which only one Pokémon can be asleep at a time), Hax Clause (items that boost the frequency of critical hits are banned), Species clause (two Pokémon of the same species are allowed), and Self KO Clause (moves that KO the user and target, such as Explosion or Destiny Bond, are not allowed) are thoroughly enforced in all Pokémon battles. Event Pokémon (for example, Mew) are barred from participating in the battle. In addition, Pokémon in the Uber tier (including Garchomp and Wobbuffet) are all banned.]]

'''To make things short''':

[[Tourneyfag|NO SAME ITEMS, NO DOUBLE TEAM/MINIMIZE/OHKO, NO UBERS, NO PRE-EVOLVED FORMS, SLEEP CLAUSE, FREEZE CLAUSE, SPECIES CLAUSE, LEVEL 50 MAXIMUM, NO SKARBLISS, NO CRESSELIA SINGLE BATTLE ONLY FGT.]]

===The Tier System===
The Smogon tier system is a categorized list that classifies Pokémon by how often they are used in online battles. However, the tier system is biased and complete [[bullshit]] since many Pokémon that have caused bawww and butthurt among Smogonites were put in the über tier.

'''The Tiers:'''


* OU ([[Samefag|Overused]]) - Most Pokémon on these tier are Pogeymanz on steroids (For example, [[Lucario]], Dusknoir or [[Robot|Metagross]]) and are placed here because they have very high stats and [[Samefag|are frequently used in almost every fucking battle]].
* UU ([[A cat is fine too|Underused]]) - Decent Pokémon (For example: Donphan, [[Buy a Dog|Arcanine]], [[W|Ambipom]], and Azumarill) which most people are too idiotic to use. 
* NU ([[Nobody cares|Never used]]) - [[nobody gives a shit|Nobody bothers]] using these pokémon at all. Many have potential, but some have [[at least 100|inferior stats]], [[Pool's Closed|movepools]], or are very vulnerable to most [[rape|attacks]]. Pokéymanz like [[Sheneequa|Jynx]], [[Mike Tyson|Hitmonchan]], [[Roundhouse kick|Hitmonlee]], [[An hero|Electrode]], [[Gardevoir]] and [[Lopunny]] can be found in this tier.
* BL ([[Bipolar|Borderline]]) - In danger of being placed in OU. Pogeymaz like [[Epic Sword Guy|Gallade]], [[Moon Man|Cresselia]], and [[Shaymin]] can be found here.
* [[Nazi|Über]] - Most of these Pogeymanz have [[over 9000|very high]] power levels, but some of these (Garchomp and Salamence) where put here since many Smogonfags kept whining that they were getting [[raped|pwned]] by Dragons which apparently are so [[lies|broken]] for the OU Metagame.
* NFE ([[Loli|Not Fully Evolved]]) - Pokémon that [[Creationism|didn't evolve]]. These include [[Mudkip]], [[Irony|Koffing]], [[Slowpoke]], and will eventually include [[Smugleaf]]. This entire tier shows that Smogonfags have no taste.

==Smogon-faggotry Spreads to YouTube==
[[File:Koffing34.jpg|thumb|[[Rule 34|No exceptions]]!]]
Shortly after the release of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, many Smogonfags flocked to [[YouTube|JewTube]] in order to request and exchange [[friend]] codes with other online battlers thanks to the new Wi-Fi features in Diamond and Pearl. They also post [[Shit nobody cares about|their recorded battles]] online use the message system [[Lurking|to talk to each other]] and to ask for the time they would battle. The majority of online Pokétards favor the Smogon rules and allow these tourneyfags to suppress them and to step on them' plus the tourneyfags will bawww and whine and threatan to send nuclear missles from their mother's ASEMENT OF DOOM to your house, if you don't follow Smogon rules or if you summon Über-tiered Pokémon. Brainman gets huge boners whenever popular online battlers on YouTube like [[fat|Marriland]], Gigatitan, and TheKillerNacho mention his website. [[Batshit Insane|It's fap material]].

==Salamence Uber drama==

Last Thursday, the admins in charge of Smogon decided that they were tired of getting assraped by Salamence in every OU match they attend, and decided to place Salamence from OU to Uber. After this decision, many Smogonfags and Pokéfags bawwwwwed and [[Suicide|killed themselves]] after hearing about the decision. However, nobody actually gives a shit since Salamence has low defenses and can de easily pwnt by pogeymanz with ice type moves. 

==How to Troll Smogonfags==
#Use an Uber Pokémon in battle.
#Use luck items in battles.
#Use [[Hacking|Pokésav]] to generate your Pogéymanz with maxed out stats in every stat.
#Say "GARCHOMP SHOULDNT B UBOOR LOL, IT DIES TO ONE ICE ATTACK U BUNCH OF SCRUBS" 
#[[Spam]] the shit out of the Smogon forums.
#[[Crapflood]] the Smogon IRC channels.
#[[????]]
#[[PROFIT]]!

==[[Anti-lulz|Firebot Development Lab]]==
Firebot Development Lab is the [[Unfunny|humorous]] section where all the [[douchebags]] go to [[Orgy|hang out]]. It is considered the "[[Lie|funny]]" section of the website. However this is a lie. In reality, it is full of [[fucktard]]s who suck at teh Pogéymanz, yet are [[retard]]ed and joined the site anyway. [[Fact|Firebot is full of elitist douchebags]] who will [[Banned|kill]] new posters who are actually [[funny]] because they are scared of outsiders. This fear comes from the fact that they are all [[basement dwellers]], and so are actually scared of the outside [[IRL|in real life]]. They refuse to accept anybody who they don't already know. Your posting quality does not matter there, as long as they already know you, or you are a [[Moderator|mod]] (they love to suck up to mods), you will be accepted. If you aren't, they will mercilessly [[Rape|torture]] you until you [[ragequit]]. There is a [[No|slim]] chance you will be accepted as long as you [[Troll|insult]] every poster you see. They are very easy to troll. The easiest way to troll them is simply to post. Other ways are mentioning serebii.net, calling them [[Truth|unfunny]], or spamming 4chan [[memes]]. This will result in [[Lulz|epic lulz]].

'''EDIT:''' In the beginning of January, Firebot was [[BALEETED|removed]]. Its successor is even less funny, if that is actually possible.
