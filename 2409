This is about the side effects and bonuses that come from being a werejohncandy.

Very useful for all those first timers out there.

Side effects:


As with most transformations there are side effects, and the ones for werejohncandy transformations are a very unique set and they are:


Increased hunger (which means said person becoming a werejohncandy often gets quite hungry before or after transformation)


John Candy-like mannerisms (this means said person becoming a werejohncandy starts to act like John Candy as well as starting to look and sound like him)Warm John Candy-like feeling inside (This is where said person turning into a werejohncandy feels an incredibly warm inside and incredibly John Candy-like usually at the start of the transformation, this is normal and actually quite nice)


Morphing into John Candy himself or one of his characters (This side effect is different than the others, the reason why is because unlike the others, this one happens at random, this one is the result of what happens when said werejohncandy views one or more of John Candy's movies so many times, this causes them to start feeling a lot like John Candy or one of his characters and also to slowly morph into him or one of his characters- it really depends on the movie though, the person would have had to seen said John Candy movie more than 20 times for it to happen, e.g if said werejohncandy has seen Stripes about 50 times or more they will turn into Ox, if they've seen Uncle Buck about 50 times or more they will turn into Uncle Buck himself, if they're seen Cool Runnings about 50 times or more they will become Irv, if they've seen an SCTV skit of his about 50x or more they will either become Johnny LaRue or one of the other SCTV characters of his- it really depends on which skit it is, but if they've seen almost every one of his movies about 50 times or more they will turn into John Candy himself- keep in mind that it happens at random so you might never know when it happens)

Increased courage (said person becoming a werejohncandy becomes much smarter and braver)

Increased taste for food of all kinds (is kind of like the increased hunger one)

Keen senses and amazing superpowers (self explanitory)

Upsides to being a werejohncandy:

There are several advantages to being a werejohncandy.


Having superhuman powers is fun (plus once you're one of these you are immortal and invincible). There is so much fun to be had with a werejohncandy superpowers. There is no limit.

The weight comes in useful for when in tricky situations (Some people and yes that includes doctors/nutritionists/health class instructors say obesity is bad for your health, but don't listen to those crackpots, obesity can be fun....it can be very fun indeed, and now that you're a werejohncandy you can use your size and weight as an advantage, use it to teach them a lesson), you see...now that you're a werejohncandy, obesity is actually good for you and nobody will ever argue with you about it, question you or even try telling you to go on a diet, in other words: You're large and in charge! Another benefit of this is that unlike a normal human- a werejohncandy is completely uneffected by weight loss methods of any kind- so that means that you'll never have to worry about losing your porty figure (which means you won't have to worry about getting liposuction or anything like that- exercising and eating healthy won't effect you either) When you're a werejohncandy, in your transformed state you'll always be fat and lovable and nothing can change that. As I always say bigger IS better.

Can eat all the food you want and you'll NEVER get sick (This means that now you're a werejohncandy, you can eat whatever you want and you'll never get sick. All you can eat buffet? Yes siree.). You want a meal fit for a king? You can have one- in fact- you can have a meal fit for a king and his army of guards, followers and loyal subjects. There is no limit to how much you can eat. You're a big, fat eatingmachine! Eat as much as you want. Just like Garfield and our cat Nico.
Downsides to being a werejohncandy:


It's murder on the wardrobe (when you're turning into a werejohncandy you bulk up becoming the same weight and height as John Candy himself which is really cool but this causes ones clothes to get tighter and then burst at the seams, this is called rippage, the good news is that when you turn back to normal your clothes somehow appear undamaged, this is what the guys at TVtropes like to call the Magic Pants trope like with the Incredible Hulk. The unfortunate thing about being a werejohncandy is that during transformation your body bulks up growing to the same height and weight as John Candy himself and this causes your clothes to get increasingly tighter and then burst at the seams, however when you return to normal your clothes will somehow appear undamaged. Here's my advice, if you're turning into a werejohncandy don't forget to have some spare clothes in case the ones you're wearing burst at the seams during transformation. 

It can be quite difficult to adjust to your John Candy-like frame at first (you see, now that you're a werejohncandy- you're the same height and wieght as John Candy and as such- it's kind of hard to adjust to having such a tall, portly frame, seeing as none of your clothes will fit you when in werejohncandy form and you'll probably find it hard trying to fit through doors or something similar), When you first turn into a werejohncandy you might find it hard to adjust to having such a large portly frame, seeing as when you're in werejohncandy form your clothes won't fit you and it's going to be hard finding a seat that won't break when you sit on it, when you first turn into a werejohncandy make sure that the room you're in has plenty of space, is wide and has vaulted walls and/or ceilings- and make sure that there are not any valuable items in the room that can easily be smashed by accident. That way you won't have to worry about breaking anything.}}
