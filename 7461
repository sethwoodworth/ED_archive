{{needsmore|fangirls providing lulz in '''shipping wars'''}}

Clipped from "relationship", '''ship''' is a term commonly found in the [[fan fiction]] [[scene]].  A pairing of two (or <s>rarely</s> often more) completely irrelevant characters in a [[Roman|romantic]] or [[sex]]ual relationship.  Originated in ''X-Files'' fandom, when the fanboys and girls masturbating over Mulder and Scully, respectively, figured it would be totally [[hott|hawt]] if Mulder and Scully knocked boots.

Most people refer to a ship by the characters in it (IE "I ship Hermione/Ron") or by the initials of the characters involved (IE "I ship [[Hagger|HG/RW]]"). Many fanons have established short forms for characters other than their initials, which can also be used (IE "I ship Hr/R"). Sometimes, however, the extreme fantards will combine the two in a [[portmanteau]]-name (IE "OMG, HERMAPHRONDITE, SO0 DESU!!!11").

Regardless of the probability of two characters getting together in [[canon]], someone already wrote a fanfic about it and posted it on [[FanFiction.Net]]. Therefore, it is impossible to come up with a ship that hasn't been invented by someone else. [[Google]] always has enough [http://www.google.com/search?q=ship+%22Hermione%2FGinny%22+OR+%22Ginny%2FHermione%22 proof] of it, though it is advised to stay away from the most [[hardcore]] ships if you're [[mundane]].

Invariably [[homosexual]].

==OTP==
[[Image:Taiora_4_ever_not.jpg|left|thumb|The scene in ''[[Digimon]]'' that will live in [[hate|infamy]].]]
[[Image:Lol_ship_warz.jpg|right|thumb|"[[Canon]] to the left of them! [[Canon]] to the right of them!"]]
OTP stands for One True Pairing, a ship that its followers cannot stand to see broken. It may be a [[canon]] relationship, one that [[over 9000]] fans have convinced themselves of being canon in the future, or one that a fan loves [[moar]] than any other.

==Shipper mentality ==
[[Image:One_true_3some.jpg|thumb|left|Shipping: [[srs bsns|Serious fucking business.]]]]
Many people wonder why there are so many people out there concerned with which underage cartoon character fucks the other. Well, no one really <strike>knows</strike> cares how people turn out that way. But we do know that the typical shipper is either:
# A [[lonely]] idealistic [[basement-dweller]] or [[16 year old girl]] who despite being rejected by every real person ever for being a [[fucktard]], is convinced [[lies|tw00 wuv conquers all]] and that no fictional character, regardless of how he/she was originally written, should [[die alone]]. This is the cause of bad fanfiction where all <strike>230,000</strike> [[over 9,000]] characters ever in any series are paired up (usually after the main characters are firmly set up, villains, one-shots, and what have you are paired up for random reasons like "they're both blonde" or something"). This person will, despite all [[fail|efforts]] to do otherwise, die alone. That is unless they don't [[final solution|kill themselves]] from the fact something bad will happen to their OTP [[oh noes]]!
# A person (usually [[whore|female]]) who is so in [[lies|luuuuuuuv]] with her boyfriend, and has such a [[accidentally|perfect]] relationship, she is convinced that everyone in her fandoms must be (or should be) in love too. This type of [[slut|shipper]] writes pretty much the same stories as the above, but is more annoying because she'll always add [[lol wut|"OMGZ, those two characters are JUST LIKE me and my BF!"]]. The boyfriend, of course, will dump her ass a week later (if he's smart), or he'll [[PROFIT|die]] somehow, and she will either renounce shipping and become an [[emo]] with a LiveJournal full of bad poetry of how [[kill it with fire|love is pointless and futile]]. Either that or she'll become the first type of shipper.

[[Image:CanNeverFindThisWhenINeedIt.png|right|thumb|It's hard for characters to be shipped together. [[srsly]].]]
'''What love is according to shippers'''
* Two characters being nice to each other for whatever reason.
* Two characters totally, utterly despising each other. They're just hiding their tw00 wuv. (NOTE: This is most usually used only in [[slash]] shipping)
* One character killing another, motivated by aforesaid hatred of the other. (See [[GoddessMillenia]].)
* Two characters meeting at least once.
* Two characters being [[incest|related by blood]]
* Two characters in the same frame.
* Two characters existing in the same show.
* Two characters existing in the same genre.
* Two characters existing. [[evar|Ever]].

==Types of Shippers==
If shippers are [[lolcow]]s, some fandoms are lulzy dairy farms. Like IRL cows, shippers come in many different varieties that all work together to bring us hours of entertainment.

==='''[[mundane|Average Shippers]]'''===
These types of [[fangirls]] will write a [[shit]]ty [[fanfic]] or two, join up some ship-centric site or fan club thread and keep to themselves, but otherwise don't pick or join any fights and thus [[shit no one cares about|no one gives a shit about them]].

==='''/[[slash]] Shippers'''===
[[Image:Trolling_xtians.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bible slash|Every fandom has slash. No exceptions.]]]]
Those who will pairing up any two characters as long as they both either have a [[penis]] or a [[vagina]],([[Tentacle rape|which is sometimes not needed]]) no matter how many times they may have fought with each other. It doesn't matter how bloody and violent their fights are or how bitterly they fight over the same guy (because twenty chicks fight over the same guy [[srsly|ALL THE TIME]], there will be slash-y [[Rule 34]] written about it. That thing you learned in Bible school about Jesus being betrayed by Judas is a lie--it was all because Judas was a [[Hard Gay|hardcore]], macho [[bitch]] that couldn't express his feelings to Jesus! [[Srsly]]!).

*Popular slash [[fandom]]s  with various pairings include:[[Final Fantasy 7]] ''[[Death Note]]'', ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo]]'', ''[[Lucky Star]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', which is also responsible for the very first [[Mary Sue]]. Oh yea and did we mention ''[[Naruto]]''? That show is so god damned gay that it makes Richard Simons look like [[Fred Phelps]]. It's not only got gays, but it's also got dykes too!

==='''Str8 Shippers'''===
Straight shippers are the antithesis of yaoi fangirls but work on the same principle. Rather than signifying someone who has a natural preference for heterosexual couples, a str8 shipper is someone who won't shut the fuck up about their preference for them, usually because [[Christianity|they are one with Jesus]] (like [[DBoyWheeler]]) or because they are [[Aspergers|asspies]] (like [[Chris-chan]]). Most of these people are weaaboos but their small brain prevents them from understanding that [[Japan]] is a land of sheer [[sick fuck|sick fuckery]] and thus [[anime]] is incompatible with monogamous premarital Christian morality. However, to be fair, most of them turn out to be [[Catholic|pedophiles]] or other fetishists anyway. Or they like [[Twilight]], which is even worse.

==='''Sue Shipper'''===
Sue shippers are possibly the worst category. These people are usually utterly devoid of social skills or a life as they are literally in love with a fictional character and thus will insist that only their shitty self insert [[Mary Sue]] combined with said character is the only valid couple ([[SapphyDracases]] and [[Waluigis-girl]] are but two examples of this disease). Most of them are complete lunatics and may even write to the company that produced their fandom of choice demanding their shitty self insert be put into the universe. Stephanie Meyer had the [[AIDS|bright idea]] to invent her own universe where her self insert is one half of the main couple and thus the center of all attention.

==='''Militant Shipper'''=== 
''See Also [[Star Trek]], [[Power Rangers]], [[Soap Opera]]''
[[Image:TruthaboutZutarians.jpg|thumb|left|As evidence shows, shippers are rational and logical people]]
They account for [[42]] percent of all shippers. The bigger and [[moar]] popular 'shipdoms believe that canon evidence proves they're right that anyone else thinking otherwise is [[doing it wrong|clearly delusional]]. Therefore, they have the right...no, the ''obligation'' to [[Spanish Inquisition|enlighten the ignorant masses]], even if that includes the author for [[jumped the shark|not knowing the series he or she wrote anymore]]. They are usually the ones who'll [[lunajack|hijack a thread]] like a [[black man]] will carjack you in LA and turn it into a shipping discussion. No matter if the topic is about the [[Death Note]]'s many uses, [[Cowboy Bebop|whether Spike Spiegel really did die]] or whether Kirk could beat Picard in a fight. 

Hilarity ensures when the fandom pet couple gets nuked from orbit. The most insane among them will become [[an heroes]] and [[final solution|quit fandom]], while many more with whine and bitch and write fanfiction to "fix" where canon went wrong, until all the [[butthurt]] fans accept that as real [[canon]]. In the most epic of torpedoed coupledom, fans will be talking about their [[epic]] [[surprise buttsex|buttrape]] from the writers for the next hundred years, as many ''[[Power Rangers]]'' fans still wax poetic over the demise of Tommy/Kim. God willing, ''[[Bleach]]'' will be included in this section one day.

So who do these fans take their frustrations out on?

==='''T3h [[Winnar]]z'''===
[[Image:Th_Remembericon.jpg|thumb|right|[[WTC|NEVER FORGET]]]]

The comeback kids that never thought they had a chance, and have probably been [[luser]]s their entire lives until [[God]] shed his grace upon them to pair up their OTP, they took shit from the other side's [[BNF]]s, and now it's their time to [[2girls1cup|rub in all the shit that had been dished out to them]] over the years. [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Die_jc_die.jpg One infamous example.]

Of course, the rest of fandom is bored with the ship wars, and think that rooting for either side is akin to [[Still a retard|winning the Special Olympics]]

*Best example [[evar]]: [[Harry_Potter#Ginny_is_a_slut_zOMG|Harry Potter and Author-Issued Clue-By-Four]]

==='''[[Intelligence|Intellectual Shippers]]'''===
[[Image:Ichirukijack.jpg|thumb|right|Picture definitely related]]

Appearing on the surface to be less rabid and having a better grasp of [[grammar]] than [[99%]] of it's fandom, most [[Fact|know]] they are [[Unwarranted self importance|smarter than the average bear]] and instead prefer [[verbose thread|big words and long sentences]] to [[troll|make a point]]. When someone calls them out on it, [[drama]] occurs and gets posted at [[Fandom Wank]], because after all, trolls don't exist for their pet pairing, and besides, they'd [[no|use nasty words and flame people directly]]. They and the militant types usually get together to engage in a huge circle jerk, and cause nearly all of fandom's ship wars.

As many such people <strike>have [[no life]]</strike> are considered to be [[ALL CAPS|ZOMG SO SMART]] to [[16 year old girl]]s, they are usually the fandom's [[BNF]]s who lead by example to write much fanfiction that bashes the ship opposing theirs and in some cases, essays. That's right, [[longcat|long]], [[boring]] write ups analyzing [[proof]] of their couple's existence. and ALL of them are [[over 9000]] pages long. [http://community.livejournal.com/ship_manifesto/ OH GOD MAKE IT STOP, PLEASE].

*This kind of shipper's most common habitats include ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Bleach]]''.

==='''[[Pansy|Nanny Shippers]]'''===
The [[frunz|killer of lulz]], they are ones who are always trying to make everyone get along and [[net neutrality|be tolerant and open minded of other opinions]]. They always tell their own side to be better than the other side and not [[troll]] and are usually sincere in their efforts to get their friends to [[STFU|quiet down a little bit]]. Since fighting over the honor of two cartoon characters' love is is [[srs bsns]], no one really listens to them.

Not to be confused with the intellectual shipper, who pull this maneuver as one of their sneaky trolls, then go back to passive-aggressive trolling in the next thread.

==='''[[Not|Not a Shipper]]'''===
[[sarcasm|Surprisingly]], there are people in fandom that [[No one gives a shit|don't give a shit]] about who's [[cock|pee-pee]] ends up in whose [[pussy|vajayjay]] or [[ass]]. And they proceed to tell everyone this at every opportunity because they really *don't* care. [[lie|Really, they don't.]] That's why their biggest contributions to fandom include bitching about other shippers and the stupid fan-squee posts they see on the shipper comm(s) on their F-list and maybe once every hundred years, they'll post about something besides little [[16 year old girl]] fan drama. They are as [[not]] shippy as Micheal Jackson is [[Not]] a Pedophile.

===Sane Shippers===
''See Also: [[Unicorn]], [[Christmas|Santa Claus]]''

One who not only ships, but actually gives a fuck about other things in their fandom besides fapping off to hawt [[fanfic]]z. A step up from the average shipper, they are not quite so loyal or opinionated on their couple to become BNFs, nor do they constantly bitch on other fans. If you see such a shipper, most likely they are a [[dual]] of a former fan who [[troll's remorse|have learned the errors of their ways in attacking their fellow fans]] or new to the [[internets]], in which case, they are ticking timebombs to Nutville.

==Steps to a Ship War==

[[Image:Shipperwars.png|thumb|left|Will someone please think of the [[loli|children]]?!]]
# Prima the Militant Shipper posts a discussion on the latest episode of her favorite series, with at most a sentence or two on her OTP, A/B.
# Secunda the Intellectual shipper discusses the chapter with [[TL;DR|thoughts]] of the less popular A/C, and a jab at A/B [[idiftl|for the lulz.]]
# Debate goes on as planned until...
# Average Shipper Tercera drop the drama bomb with spoilers!!!11!one Apparently, their [[nobody|father's uncle's nephew's cousin's former roommate]] heard that the writers have planned [[The_cancer_that_is_killing_b|a cancer to kill B]] in the season finale, and boy that really sucks that A/B won't become canon before then.
# Prima instantly [[Chris Crocker|becomes hysterical]] and just can't believe it, and asks for proof, which comes from a [[sauce|few reliable sources]] 
# Secunda posts even more thoughts on A/C, and how she wonders if A will go to C after B's death for [[buttsex|comfort]].
# Prima takes this as a personal insult, and Cuatra and Quinta comes along to agree, all echoing their hive queen's thoughts.
# Secunda is a seasoned expert at milking these [[lolcow]]s and knows she can make them look more stupid by using big words to hide her insults.
# Sexta, having been [[butthurt|oppressed]] by Prima, Quatra and Quinta since the beginning of t3h fandom proceeds to act like a [[winnar]] and posting JPEGS of "A/B RIP" tombstones to piss them off, because those bitches had it coming for telling her A/C was only shipped by delusional whackjobs!
# Septima(who falls under both the Yaoi and Nanny type)comes along to say "Who cares about A/B OR A/C when we can all oogle B/C?" [[Shit no one cares about|No one gives a fuck]].
# Ocvata the mod threatens [[b&]]s to people if they don't quit adding [[Pool's Closed|AIDS to the pool]].
# Prima then starts bashing everyone from Character C to the writers and director for this moral outrage and how she will get all her friends to petition this show and get it canceled for this
# Secunda makes more snide remarks, which Prima rises up to.
# Reluctantly, Septima throws the [[banhammer]] at both Prima and Secunda, who then head off to their respective shipper comm to rally the troops; Prima to come up with ways to [[Holocaust|deny this ever happened]], and Secunda to rally the troops for a great victory party.
# Novena the Not!Shipper reads the thread and yells "[[Arguecat|THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS!]]"
#Quarta, Quinta, Sexta and over 9000 other [[fantard]]s all continue the fight [[for great justice]]
#Decima the Sane Shipper is laughing her ass off as she writes an account of this for [[Fandom Wank]]'s 4234533453rd article on Fandom X's shipper fight

==[[But What Are Your Thoughts On Yaoi?|Shippers Say The Darnedest Things]]==

* "So a couple weeks ago, I was [[insane]]ly bored and was poking around [[YouTube]] and I somehow stumbled onto someone who had posted the entire first and second seasons of ''[[Digimon]]'' (bless them)...

..And then...I get to the [[Christmas]] episode in season 2. When Tai asks Sora out and she rejects him because of Matt. And then she goes and marries Matt in the end. And I'm sitting there staring at my computer screen, gaping and trying so hard not to scream. [[wank|Because its ''Tai''. And its ''Sora'']]. And its supposed to be Tai and Sora because in the first episode he said that Sora wasn't that bad "for a girl" and Tai was the one who went back and saved Sora when she got captured by that little computer chip Digimon in the pyramid and Sora was the one who's always going "stupid Tai" and [[flame|fighting with him]] and um, hello, in the movie it was who Tai wrote that email to Sora and freaked out because he signed in "love" and that was so cute and [[OMG|oh my goodness]] she is not supposed to be with Matt." --Random Digimon fan
