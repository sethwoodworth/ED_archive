'''Tulip''' is a [[cat]] who has appeared on [[4chan]]'s /an/ several times. Dubbed GlaucomaCat, she has a congenital disorder that has led to [[anime|extremely large eyes]]; it is not known what caused this. However, as a result, she has severe glaucoma (pressure in the eyes) and cataracts; the glaucoma has resulted in total loss of retina function and, thus, blind. She is known for demanding [[turkey]] in the morning and loves to play with [[lolwut|laser pens]].
