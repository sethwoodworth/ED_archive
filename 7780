Similar in some ways to [[Numa Numa]] (only even [[unfunny|unfunnier]]), the '''''[[Star Wars]]'' Kid''' phenomena also features a [[fat|obese]] [[lie|lad]] [[Fail|doing embarrassing things in front of a camera]]. 

However, instead of purposely recording himself to be put on the Internet, a boy from [[Canada]] named Ghyslain Raza became an [[Internet celebrity]] almost overnight, due to his hilarious antics with a golf-ball collector and a video camera. 

== Origins ==
On November 8, [[2002]] a young [[YouTube_Nobodies#BigAl2k6|BigAl2k6]] had made a video of himself acting like the ''Star Wars'' character Darth Maul, using a golf ball retriever to represent his lightsaber. It was filmed at the studio of his high school (Séminaire St-Joseph). On April 19, 2003 one of his friends stumbled on the tape and uploaded it to the Kazaa peer-to-peer file sharing network as a prank.

The video file spread across the [[Internets]] extremely rapidly; within mere weeks it had been downloaded [[9000| OVER 9,000 times]]. Within days, artists all over the world began making modifications such as adding music, visual effects and sounds, combining it with other well-known videos or scenes from films, etc. for comic effect. Among the many renditions is a ''[[Matrix]]'' video, with BigAl2k6 as Neo.

It has been rumored that the ''Star Wars'' Kid was in fact [[faggot|Slashpanda]] (aka BigAl2k6).

== Profit ==
There were news reports that the ''Star Wars'' Kid's mom filed a CA $351,000 (USD $0.86) lawsuit against the kids who uploaded the video, citing the "[[BAWWWW|harassment and derision]]" suffered by Raza as the prank had turned him into a global Internet cause [[e-famous|célèbre]]. In 2006, Raza and his tormentors, Michaël Caron, Jean-Michel Rheault and the aptly named Jérôme Laflamme, reached an out-of-court settlement for an unknown sum. Raza finished his school year at the Pavillon Arc-en-ciel ("[[Gay|Rainbow Ward]]" in [[English]]) child psychiatry ward at the Trois-Rivières Regional Hospital Centre. 

Just remember the basics:
*Step 1: Tape yourself acting like a douchebag.
*Step 2: Leave the tape out so your hilarious friends can upload the video on the internets.
*Step 3: ?????
*Step 4: PROFIT
