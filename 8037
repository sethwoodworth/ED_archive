'''[http://www.taurinfox.com Taurin Fox]''' (real name [http://www.matt-willard.com/ Matt Willard]) is a [[furry]] [[furry art|artist]]. He is perhaps known for the image to the right which is known for making 2/3 of ED sick on sight--he claims that it is male, but why does it have tits? He [[Otherkin|finds a spiritual connection to the fox]] and often fantasized about being a fox. He has a large gallery of [[yiff|yifftastic]] images.

He also works in computer animation. One of his animations is titled [[LOL WUT|''Taurin and the Yiffing Machine'']] which is basically a rip-off of the IT from ''[[South Park]]''. <s>[http://www.taurinfox.com/animation.html No, srsly.]</s> Oh wait, he doesn't do porn no more.

==[[Shit|Beliefs]]==
"''A large number of my images are sexually oriented. [[Lie|This is because I feel there is a strong connection between sexuality and spirituality. (Note: Rasputin thought this too) On the surface, some of the images may appear to be "just about sex" or maybe even "pornography" (this is a dirty word by the way when referring to the work of a visual artist ;) But this really isn't the case in my work. I feel that there is a certain inner-energy associated with sexuality, and this is kind of my way of expressing that energy. I believe that through this energy, its possible to completely understand one self, and that the energy itself can be focused in other directions, particularly creativity]].''"

This argument would be more valid if 90% of his images weren't porn. (Note: Taurin Fox's description of Rasputin as a spiritual sex machine comes from the 1978 song "Rasputin", in which sexuality was added to the story to appeal to the [[Niggers|African American Populace]] during the 70's. Rasputin would never amount to furfaggotry anyway.) His images not shown here contain [[rape]], [[vore]], and possibly some [[shitting dick nipples]]. [[W]] and the [[Republican]] party would do well to get ahold of [http://www.taurinfox.com/art/2004/commentary.html this page]. Because being hated by furries is an excellent campaign slogan.

[[Image:TaurinPC.jpg|thumb|300px| Taurin's reaction to his [[ED]] article.]]

In order to prove how little he cares about the [[truth|immature, bigoted]] article - Taurin actually briefly joined the ranks of [[ED]]:
