Did you ever wonder what would happen if the [[vocaloid|Autotune program suddenly had it's own voice]]? Ever wonder what it would sound like if your hard drive crashed while playing music? Or maybe you just want to hear some really bad music? Look no further than Owl City!

'''Owl City''', or rather, '''Adam Young''', is a [[shitty]] performer who is well known for his [[music]] which consists of him [[Bawww|whining]] into the microphone over a backing track that sounds like a [[Keyboard|MIDI]] track had [[sex]] with a [[iPhone|cell phone]] ringtone. Literally living in his parents' [[basement]] until last year, when he was  discovered by [[Jews]] trying to find the next [[Faggot|Conor Oberst]], and coming from the absolute middle of nowhere that is [[Minnesota]]. To date, this is the only non-Jonas or [[Twilight|ginger vampire]] making [[loli|girls]] schlick and making his [[Aspie|semi-Autistic]] "music" somehow have a meaning in their life. Truly, if it wasn't for the fact he looked like he ate bowls of dongs for breakfast, [[trolls|some of you]] may think he's doing it for the [[lulz]]. Sorry to say, he's the [[Chris-Chan|true-and-honest article]] of good things happening to bad musicians.<br />

Comparably, [[some argue|some have said]] that his music is reminiscent of [[Emo|Taking Back Sunday]] if it were composed by one douchebag on [[Reason]], and sung by [[Portal|the GLaDOS supercomputer]]. Those people would be right. Adam is so fond of the Autotune programs he uses, [[rap]] [[fucktard|artists]] like black person are probably somewhere [[LOL WUT|in disbelief]] while the white kid tweet's and YouTube's his way to [[MTV]] like [[Jonas Brothers|some other bands we know]] and gets [[Jew Gold|major-label money]] doing it. That's probably the biggest part of his "appeal" is just how much money he DOES make as opposed to how shit quality his stop-motion videos are supposed to look. [[Donation Grandstanding|He could probably buy Encyclopedia Dramatica 5-6 times over for a whole year, if he chose to do so.]] Unfortunately for his parents, as well as society, he's probably been using his money on [[Pocky]] instead of paying his family back after [[loser|dropping out of college]] and living in their basement until [[Bailout Plan|UMG bought the rights to his soul]] and started scheming on how to sell him and his autism-inspired music to the masses.

Incidentally, Adam has several other projects on the go of varying genres, none of which he is working on because he's exploiting the success of Owl City to make more money and some of which are actually really fucking good. Take Port Blue for example, influenced by ambient and post-rock music like Sigur Rós, Tortoise and Helios, which isn't meant for mass commercial appeal in the slightest.

===Lip Sync, in my Owl City?===

''It's more likely than you think.'' Lip Syncing, [[Retard|for those who don't know]], is when a performer simply moves his lips over pre-recorded vocals. This is of course, fuckin' lame, but blame should not be placed ''solely'' on the performer, as their fans do not condone this activity. Just ask '''any''' [[Britney Spears]] fan, the illusion will suffice. Anyway, Owl City likes to take his fake performances one step further by [[Srsly|pretending to play guitar]] and having someone, usually a chick, use his [[fail|pre-programmed synth/Macbook with Audacity on loop]].

===Haven't we heard this before?===

Apparently, Owl City isn't particularly original. [[Everyone|Who would have thought?]] Indeed, a [http://stereogum.com/99521/owl_city_pretty_much_admit_ripping_off_postal_serv/house300/ few critics] have suggested that he has ripped off a short lived band called Postal Service. For anyone who isn't an [[Indie]] douche, The Postal Service is some weird, [[USI|narcissistic]] Electronic band made by members of Death Cab for Cutie, an Indie band most recently known for making a shitty "hit" song for the recent [[Twilight]] movie, "New Moon". Adam attempted to cover up his tracks by citing them as an influence, [[Lies|even though he totally hasn't heard much of their material]]:

==His Fans==

Because his music sucks, naturally it is [[love|loved]] by [[13 year old girl|13 year old girls]] everywhere. If you ask them, they will tell you that his music is [[retard|deep]] and [[Toyota|moving]]. When in reality, his music is about as deep and moving as taking a [[shit]]. Techno faggots have also been known to [[masturbate]] over his music, getting the impression that [[Catnarok|someday all techno music will become mainstream]]. Fortunately, the chances of this are 1 to [[over 9000]], forcing the technos [[Basement-dweller|back into submission]].
===Trolling===
If you should encounter a fan of Owl City, you can troll them by:
*Mentioning he lived in his [[basement dweller|parents' basement]] until Universal officially took ownership of his ass [[2009|last year]].
*Claiming you first heard one of his songs when you were looking for ringtones in your cell phone from 2000.
*Ask them if he did the producing for [[Justin Bieber]].
*See if they can explain any one of his songs' meanings besides them being [[Autism]]-fueled permavirginity.
*Saying the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsGc6-lNAHQ parodies] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwRJGk4E5D0 are] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFQfL6iVGAI better] (because they are).

{{quote|Swimming in a [[lemon]] creek

Tadpoles tickle my [[Ass|butt cheeks]]

A bearded [[Jesus|nun]] flies through the sky

I wrote this [[Music|song]] when I was high

I make love to birds and bees

And [[masturbate]] to redwood trees |A surprisingly accurate parody}}

Since his lyrics already don't make any sense, they're incredibly easy to [[parody]]. Numerous parodies have been uploaded to [[YouTube]] to date, and 99% of them are far better and more comprehensible than the original. [[Irony|Ironically]], these parodies are all in fact more IRL [[Indie]] than his music, which is a good thing to point out to any [[jailbait|bright young woman]] who listens to his oh-so-original music and read his [[gay|diabetes-inducing Tweets]] where he talks about himself doing things by himself. [[Dying Alone|Often]].
