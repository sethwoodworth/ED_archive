In an age where [[niggers|black people]] are offended by racism to the point where they act like [[asspie|autistic children]], it was only a matter of time until the black person would devour another victim in their intolerance-hating jaws. Enter [[batshit crazy|crazy old coot]] '''Don Imus''', the black person latest black person toy and victim of a [[boring|slow news day]]. Don Imus is a martyr in the race war against subhumans rising up against the white man.  But fuck, is this man ugly.

==Root of Teh [[Butthurt|Controversy]]==

On April 4th 07, radio-show host Don Imus accurately described a bunch of [[niggers|black female]] [[college]] basketball players as "nappy headed hos." Since black person people are [[autistic|sensitive as fuck]], national outrage broke loose from the black person women's fan-base. Even though the comment was hardly evil, loads of people managed to get angry and [[Democrats|butthurt]] over it. Although the players were in fact nappy-headed - something ignored by everyone who objected - Imus attempted to defuse the situation by claiming that he made the statement as a joke. Regardless, both CBS and M$NBC tried to turn it into a prison rape by putting Imus on suspension for two weeks, only to ultimately [[permaban]] him from the [[radio|airwaves]] before the suspension was up. Sources say this was because the [[niggers|negrosauruses]] were [[terrorism|threatening]] to eat M$NBC's leader.

It should be noted that had there been [[9/11|something else]] going on in the world for the [[media]] to [[in the ass|dogpile]] on, [[noone]] would have noticed Imus' black person [[lulz|slur]] ... and that Imus' producer Bernard McGuirks must be made of Teflon because he followed the "slur" with his own [[lulz|'observation']]&mdash;that the [[niggers|Rutgers]]&mdash;[[white trash|Tennessee]] women's [[college|NCAA]] final was "the [[niggers|Jiggaboos]] vs. the Wannabes"&mdash;without getting fired.

==Apology and Further Shitstorming==

On April 9th, Imus issued this public apology:

{{quote|"I want to take a moment to [[Troll's Remorse|apologize]] for an insensitive and ill-conceived remark we made the other morning regarding the Rutgers women's basketball team, which [[Luser|lost]] to Tennessee in the NCAA championship game on Tuesday. It was completely inappropriate and we can understand why people were offended. Our characterization was thoughtless and stupid, and we are sorry."|--Don Imus}}

Being the kind, caring and understanding people that [[niggers|blacks]] are, they immediately accused him of being a black person, since [[lie|black people have the power to read people's minds]]. black person, black person and black person (president of [[NAACP]])  also joined the black person terrorism organization, saying that Imus needs to [[GTFO|get the fuck off]], and starting a [[The Great Habbo Raid of July 2006|national campaign to drag everything he has from under his feet]], because he made [[fucktard|one good-natured]] but seemingly [[racist|offensive comment]]. Remember, this was right after he [[sorry|apologized]]. Did we mention how kind and forgiving [[niggers|negroids]] are?

==No really, GTFO==

On April 11th, MSNBC cunt-punted Imus off their network, after further threats from the band of [[niggers|negrosauruses]]. To also get him kicked off radio (CBS), the [[niggers|negrosauruses]] have threatened to boycott every company that advertises with his radio show, because they're clearly insensitive [[racist]] [[fucktard|fuckwads]] for advertising on his radio show. Every single one of Don's supporters has pulled out, since they didn't want any part of the drama-induced PMS fluid inflicted on Don's [[balls]]. As a result of this, CBS [[b&|banned]] Don from their lair, because they're pussies who are afraid of controversy.

==Imus' likeness is further abused==

Because [[niggers|black people]] are such huge [[drama llama|drama llamas]], they figured they might as well use this shitstorm of [[stupid|stupidity]] to promote their '[[niggers|blacks]] deserve to be treated better than everyone else' agenda. Half of America's population are [[Democrat|negro-lovers]], so their [[terrorist]] plot will most likely succeed. Attempts have been made to alert [[W|government]] [[Condoleeza Rice|officials]] of this ring of terrorism, but they're too busy fighting fictional enemies in [[Afghanistan|make]]-[[Iraq|believe]] [[Iran|countries.]]

==Snoop Dogg Weighs In==

{{quote|[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1556803/20070410/id_0.jhtml First of all, we ain't no old-ass white men that sit up on MSNBC going hard on black girls. We are rappers that have these songs coming from our minds and our souls that are relevant to what we feel. I will not let them muthafuckas say we in the same league as him.]|Snoop Dogg ''During his promotional speech for his new hit song'' "I Wanna Fuck You"}}

Snoop Dogg could not be reached for a follow-up comment as he was too busy kicking the shit out of his wife before he snorted cocaine off a 16 year-old black girl's chest.

==[[Lol-cow|Mancow]] gives Imus the [[barrel roll|Cold Shoulder]]==

{{quote|...there is a line in this business, and even ''I'' believe (Imus) crossed it.|Mancow, [[douchebag]] extraordinairre}}

[[rumor|Word on the street is]], he turned his back on [[O&A]] in the face of [[controversy]] as well, just like [[fucktard|Curtis Sliwah]] did.

==Previous Acts of Racism==
This isn't the first time that Imus has been a racist dickhead. In 1999, he viciously founded the Imus Ranch for Kids with Cancer, dedicated to giving [[An Hero|sick children]] (a quarter of whom are black) a chance to experience a real, working [[lol cow|cattle]] ranch. He was instrumental in raising money for his white-supremest terrorist organization  'Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund', which established a hospital to help wounded Iraq War veterans who have suffered traumatic war injuries. Imus also helped increase the death benefit given to families whose loved ones died in combat. What a fucking asshole, [[amirite]]?

==Imus Repeals His B&==

As of Dec 3rd, Imus is back on the air. Several hundred balding [[Habbo]] users showed up in their underwear and wifebeaters to drunkenly welcome the waxy-faced redneck back to his show. No niggers were present to protest the event due to the fact that the return show benefit was being held next to a [[KFC|Popeyes]].

Only a single person showed up to protest, a "[[unemployed|freelance moralist]]" named Phillip Nobile. The [[cracker]] demanded that Imus apologize for his "lifetime of bigotry." The fans in attendance demanded that Nobile "squeal like a piggy" and proceeded to gangfuck him into the shape of a pretzel.
