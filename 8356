In late December 2009, on the [[x/|/x/]] board of [[4chan]], a post was made, asking simply [[Who was phone]]? Aside from being politely asked to [[GTFO]] and head on back to [[b/|/b/]], requests were made for further examples of [[creepypasta]]. The pickings were slim for new material until one lone genius weighed in with the following [[all caps]] gem, seemingly of his own making:

Did you hear that guys? A SKELETON POPPED OUT! He ran up to the passenger side and opened the door, and then when he opened the door, a skeleton, popped out. Just like that.

==/x/ Reacts==

Of course the denizens of the /x/ board had found a new hero, an eloquent and misunderstood soul with a penchant for the unnatural and a writing style rarely seen in generic creepypasta. Without missing a beat, literally tens of posts had [[Creepypasta/Retarded Creepypasta|retarded creepypasta]] with '''"Then a skeleton popped out"''' tacked onto the end.

Every time you exhale, a little bit of your soul escapes. Luckily, you almost always inhale it back before anyone else gets to it. Almost.

Ever fogged up a mirror with your breath?

Don't do that. A skeleton pops out.|Slips in naturally there.
|It might happen one morning that you wake up home alone. This could be normal depending on your situation, but this morning will be different. While your environment will all seem exactly the same, you’ll notice that everything is quieter than normal. If you go outside, you will notice a distinct lack of anything like birds, insects… or people. As far as you travel, you will not encounter another sentient human being. The entire world will be intact, empty except for you.

There are currently over 100,000 missing persons cases in the United States. People slip through the cracks all the time. Then a skeleton pops out.|Oh right, like one slips in, one pops out..
|If you watch every State of the Union Address since it's been filmed and available on tape, you'll see that halfway through--exactly halfway through--the President always says the same word. Most say it under their breath during the standing ovations, but some are forced to work it into the speech itself. It's in recognition of a pact, though only his aides know what the election has cost him. Then a skeleton popped out.|The rest is just this.
|Go to any mirror and put your hand against the glass. Don't worry, nothing will grab you. Wait. Sometimes it takes half a day, sometimes it takes a moment. But you'll yank your hand away when you feel it.

Worms or centipedes, who knows? All pressed in tight like there's no more room on that side, wriggling against your skin. When you pull back, the glass is the same and you'll be unharmed.
But now you know it's there.
Then a skeleton popped out.|See, awesome.
|On the 3rd of December, find a hand-held mirror, just large enough to cover your face. Cover your face with the reflective side out, walk into the bathroom, turn the light on, and stand in front of the larger mirror. At exactly 11:34pm, raise the hand-held mirror above your head.
What is in the larger mirror will not be staring back at you, nor will it be your reflection.
Very carefully walk out of the bathroom, backwards, not lowering the hand-held mirror until the one in the bathroom is completely out of view.
If you do not, what you saw in the mirror will notice, and realize what you have done... then a skeleton popped out.|Just shit [[creepypasta]] now.
