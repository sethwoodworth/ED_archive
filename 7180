Saddam Barrack Obama Husein was [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/51/217.html installed in 1963 by John F. Kennedy] as teh new [http://ru.youtube.com/watch?v=b1pegMeq_lE leader-leader] of the [[Iraq]]i [[oil]] fields. A once favored CIA asset serving Jewnited states interests but after getting rid of the Kennedy's and after the first Gulf invasion the CIA attempted to [[permaban]] Hussein and his Ba'ath [http://thepartyparty.com Party-Party] several times up the ass.

A strong supporter of all things [[politically correct]], Saddam Hussein was devoutly liberal in many of his views, save those that deal with rape, murder, blackmail, extortion, torture, genocide, cannibalism, gardening, and intolerance. He was specially notable for the massacre of the Kurds, which he quite rightly justified as having committed "for the [[I did it for the lulz|lulz]]", he was [http://www.warcomeshome.org/ just following orders] after all.

Saddam mainly listens to music by bands such as Type O Negative and Otep, and thus was widely respected in [[Goth]] subculture. His moustache was, in fact, modelled on that of his hero, the lead singer of [[System of a Down]]. Despite the fact he was a [[goth]], he was loved by everyone, even [[Jews]] and [[Mecha-Hitler]].

Saddam's greatest weapon had always been known to be one of two things: his very, very deep, highly platonic and appropriate love for all living things, and his [[oil|gas]].

Furthermore, from his [http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/50163 extraterrestrial sources] Saddam knew about, both invasions of Iraq and that Russia, the Jewnited States and Israel will invade Iran all in good preparation for the epic [[WWIII|World War]] with China.

All good faith edits in the context of the [[Rule 34|overpopulation problems]] that harm Jew.

[[At least 100 years ago]], [[W]] and [[Tony Blair]] decided it might be fun if they played 'Find the Nuke' with Saddam, a very popular game at the time.

The rules were very simple; [[an hero|David Kelly]], a weapons inspector for the [[United Nations]], was to wander around Saddam's favorite palace, the [[India|Taj Mahal]] trying to find any [[Goatse|Weapons of Mass Destruction]] that were lying around. The resulting adventure was recorded in [[Disney]]'s Aladdin.

After 12 levels and 6 bosses, David still had not found Saddam Hussein's nuclear penis: all he had found was a few thousand gallons of highly flammable, volatile, and valuable oil, which he wasn't allowed to keep.
Very upset, he went home to the [[United Nations]].

To this day, his capture is protested by [[Muslims]] and suicidal pilots all over the world.
For his lolocausting of the Kurdish mountain apes, he is revered by many peoples such as the other Arabs and Assyrians, also Turks.

==Hanging with Saddam==

On 5th November 2006, Saddam was [[Pwnd|sentenced to death by hanging]], and can now go and hang with his Brothers in the great terrorist camp in the sky. He was not sentenced due to his allegedly crimes against humanity, they decided to kill him for the [[Lulz]]. Here's the [[bureaucratic fuck|official]] cellphone-video footage. Saddam's execution caused a minor stir in the [[old media]], but as the grainy video was near unwatchable on a flashy new 73-inch 1080p, it held viewers interest only momentarily.  It has, however, solved all of [[Iraq]]'s problems.

==Hep Kitten's Fresh Saddam of Bel Air==
 Now this is a story all about how 
 Saddam got hung turned upside down
 Id like to take a minute chill here with me, 
 Ill tell you how Saddam became the fake prince of WMDs
 
 IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN western Iraq born and raised
 Killin Kurds was how he spent most of his days
 Chillin the palace, relaxin all cool
 Raping some virgins outside by the pool
 When a couple of Bushes who were up to no good
 Started dropping bombs on his neighborhood
 He made one little movie and Cheney got all scared
 And said FIND HIM AND PUT HIM ON TV BEING DRAGGED OUT OF HIS LAIR
 He whistled for his trial but when it came near
 The judge was UN and obviously a queer
 If anything you could say that this man was fucked
 So I thought awe forget it and smoked a fat blunt
 I came on irc around six or seven
 Heard he was dead raping virgins in Heaven
 Looked at my Kingdom, said goodbye to Saddam
 To sit on my Throne the Fresh Prince of your mom

[[Image:saddamlazer.gif|thumb|Saddam's last words.]]
As the sands of time did that thing they do when time is running out (even though if you turn the egg-timer upside down you can start again...unlike Saddam) [[bureaucratic fucks|world leaders]] and [[Arabs|proles]] alike weighed in on the [[lulz|weighty issue]]. One of the first was Tony Benn, former Labour MP and a leading figure in the [[British]] opposition to the [[Iraq]] war. He travelled to Baghdad and met and interviewed Saddam Hussein in [[Last Thursday|February of 2003]]. 

He also met with Saddam Hussein on the eve of the Gulf War. He helped to secure the release of Britons being used as [[pwnt|human shields]] after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 

Appearing on the Jew show as Saddam had his last meal of Shiite [[balls]] on a stick, Benn was asked if it was true that he opposed the execution. What follows is his response and subsequent conversation with King.

'''BENN:''' Well, I'm against the death penalty. But 665,000 (now 3 million+!!1!) Iraqis have died since the United States and Britain invaded Iraq. One more death will probably be presented as a triumph for democracy. 

But the real verdict on Iraq came in the midterm elections. The American voters realized, like Vietnam, it was an unwinnable war. And I think that is the real background. 

Of course, Saddam was a close ally of the United States. When I met him in 1990, just before Kuwait, he said, "''I feel utterly betrayed by the United States. They armed me. They sent me into Iraq -- Iran''" and so on. 

So there's a history to it that hasn't come out so far in the discussion. 

'''KING:''' You are not saying, Tony, that he is not a [[tyrant]], are you? 

'''BENN:''' Oh no. After Pinochet in Chile was put there by the [[CIA]] [[killed]] a lot of his opponents. But the [[Americans]] were told he was linked to [[9/11]]. He was not. Americans were told and so we had weapons of mass destruction. He didn't. I mean, I think most people in the world know why the invasion occurred. The president wanted the [[oil]]. And the consequences of this execution may make the present crisis worse, but it certainly won't solve it. 

'''KING:''' What should his punishment be? 

'''BENN:''' [[What|What will his what?]]

'''KING:''' What should his punishment be? 

'''BENN:''' Well, I mean, giving my personal [[opinion]]. I remember the [[Nuremberg]] trials after the war, and I was in favor. But I think pinning it all on one person and hanging them is not as good as Desmond Tutu, Archbishop Tutu, who talks about truth and reconciliation. 

If in [[South Africa]], [[Nelson Mandela]] had hanged all the [[white]] leaders of the [[Apartheid]] regime, there would have been endless vengeance and bitterness and [[killing]]. He didn't. He said bring out the [[truth]] and make that the basis. And I think that is a better way of doing it than executing people. That's my conviction now."

==Death Conspiracies==
Saddam didn't actually die. His death was faked by the [[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy|Illuminati]]. Saddam is currently chilling with Tupac, Elvis, Sasquatch, and [[Osama bin Laden]] in [[Pakistan|India's basement]]. A perfect plan, as no one will suspect that they are living in there.
