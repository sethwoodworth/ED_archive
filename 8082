Not since ''[[loli|Sesame Street]]'' has there been such an edutaining programme as '''''Teletubbies''''', with its strong anti-[[drugs]] and anti-homosexuality message. An instant hit with [[Christians]] and [[Ann Coulter]], the programme provides a savage indictment of a hedonistic lifestyle and shows the consequences of being a [[Jimbo Wales|gay liberal]] living in [[Los Angeles|LaLa Land]].<br><br>

==Dramatis Personae==

*'''Po'''

A Maoist [[communist]] - the archtypical red - Po suffers from a [[dwarf|stumpy]]'s Napoleon complex and threatens people with a circular ball. The symbol above Po's head represents the [[Azn]] rising sun and portends [[China|global domination]] by 2010.

*'''LaLa'''

Based loosely on [[Paris Hilton]], LaLa (from LA, geddit?) is the typical amoral member of the [[Fox|Meedya]], spreading [[porn]] and anti-American propaganda through our children's [[playstation|tellyboxes]].

*'''Tinky Winky'''

[[Not Gay]]

*'''[[Barney]]'''

A purple [[dinosaur]] who is the genial traditionalist face of brain-washing. Obviously meant to be from an [[wales|ethic minority]] and proof that man and dinosaur [[creationism|co-existed]]. <s>WRONG TV SHOW FAGGOT!</s> ORLY?

*'''NooNoo'''

A symbol of the [[Donald Rumsfeld|military-industrial complex]], this leviathan of a vaccuum cleaner sweeps across the ''Teletubbies'' landscape, hooting like one of the [[Nevada|Martian]] tripods and sucking up innocent [[dog|rabbits]] as it goes.

*'''Baby Jesus'''

This Jew charlatan gazes down from the heavens gurgling nonsense and promising a "happy bedtime" in the [[bomb|afterlife]].

==Typical Teletubbies script excerpt==

Episode 666: "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Courage_and_Her_Children Mother Courage and Her Children]"<br><br>

Tinky-Winky: "For that little bird whisper in your ear<br> "That's all very well but wait a year<br> And we will join the big brass band<br> And with our trumpet in our hand<br> We will march in lockstep with the rest.<br> But one day, look! The battalions wheel!<br> The whole thing swings from east to west!<br> And falling on our knees, we squeal:<br> Baby Jesus, He knows best!"<br>

LaLa: "Eh oh!"

==The Fimbles==

A [[Republican]] repost to the anarchic free-loving Teletubbies [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fimbles].

==In The Night Garden==

[[Image:Jesper Jensen.jpg|thumb|A typical scene from ''In The Night Garden''.]]

Remember that bit in ''[[Arnold Schwarzenegger|Terminator 2]]'' where [[hawt|Sarah Connor]] had to be [[drug]]ged and restrained to stop her wrecking her cell and [[lesbian|doing pull-ups on the bedstead]]?

This is what will happen to you if you watch ''In The Night Garden'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_night_garden]. Created by a group of heavy crack smokers from the [[dream|nightmares]] of [[Blu Aardvark|William S. Burroughs]], this [[genocide|atrocity]] is narrated by Sir Derek Jacobi ([[Doctor Who|the Master from ''Doctor Who'']]) and feature [[Serial killer|Upsy Daisy, Igglepiggle, Makka Pakka, the Pontipines, the Wottingers, the Haahoos and three Tombliboos]] who live in DeviantART's [[hell|Garden of Earthly Delights]]. Akin to the [[torture]] scene in ''Clockwork Orange''.
