The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) is some bullshit agency within the collection of patched-together fuckups that is the Government of [[England|Ingle Land]]. Inspired by the recent revelation of the [[London_2012_Olympics_Logo|London Olympics]] logo, the Ingles in the OGC recently decided to update their logo, too. So they hired a designer, and, £14,000 later, they got their logo.

Sadly, they neglected to check their new logo from a variety of angles before putting it on shitloads of official OGC mousepads, coffee cups, and stationery. 

Epic [[lulz]] ensued shortly thereafter.
