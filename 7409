Shadowland.org
[http://www.shadowland.org Shadowland Six] is a free online [[role-playing]] community which uses technology that was State Of The Art [[at least 100 years ago]].
== History ==
'''Shadowland 1''' was the brainchild of "Dave", who later found employment working on Netscape and now the Safari browsers.  It was a simple set of pages used to document his Shadowrun [[role-playing]] game.

'''Shadowland 2''' was the first version of the site to allow posting by any [[fucktard]] who signed up.  It ran off of [[CGI]] scripts and required a working knowledge of [[HTML]] by its users.  

'''Shadowland 3''' offerend minor updates to the SL2 system and ushered in the '''Tarantino Age.''' 

'''Shadowland 4''' was a drastic change to the system, requiring a java-enabled browser far before they were commonplace.  A lot of people left and ''the Tarantino Age'' continued unchecked.

'''Shadowland 5''' and '''Shadowland 6''' were minor upgrades to the SL4 system.  Since all of the Java code is now eight years old, it no longer works on new computers.  No one goes there any more because of the broken software and endless [[drama]].

== Administration ==

Administrators at Shadowland are called "Superusers."  They are chosen by the number of sexual disfunctions possessed.  This enables easy access to all other administrators on the site and keeps the system running smoothly.  Although cybersex is openly mocked in the chats and forums, an administrator must be willing and able to engage in that same practice without being caught.  

It is also advisable to travel the country and [[fuck]] as many other users as administrators as possible.  The more people you sleep with on-line or [[IRL]], the higher your prestige becomes.  It says so in the [http://www.shadowrunrpg.com Shadowrun] game books.

== Drama ==
When everyone is [[fuck]]ing everyone else on the site, drama occurs. 

=== The Tarantino Age ===
[[Image:Typical sl game.jpg|thumb|right|Two highly skilled writers getting ready to [[masturbate]].]]
A user calling himself ''Mr. Blond'' began pulling SL's first real clique around himself.  He convinced many that [[role-playing]] on the internet would no longer be [[lame]] if everyone used proper grammar and described their stories as though transcribing a Quentin Tarantino Film.  

* ''Regular internet roleplaying'':  *Takes piss* [[lol]]
* ''Tarantino Age Roleplaying'':  Jacque the Muskrat Jones unzipped his fly cooly, casually in front of the urinal.  Just then, Little Richard's ''Tutti Fruity'' began playing over the nightclub loudspeakers.  His robot ears allowed him to duck just before the bullets came crashing through the commode door and turned the others into a spray of blood and gore.  ''A-whomp ba-da-boom-bowm'', indeed.

Everyone agreed this was ''not lame''.  Cybersex soon followed as a way of ''getting into character.''

This age later culminated in "games" about futuristic [[pregnant]] [[lesbian]] [[elf|elves]] jumping off of roof tops while listening to shit bands.  Again it was agreed that this was not lame, and more [[cybersex]] ensued.

=== Make Me Forget ===
Because the system is easily hackable, one of Shadowland's lesbians was caught having [[cybersex]] with one of its men.  Her cry of pleasure,  ''"Oh yes!  Make me forget I'm a [[dyke]] tonight!"'' lives on in infamy.  Further investigation of the lesbian revealed her to be a male member of the US Military [[IRL]].

=== LLS ===
A user by the name of SnaitN had a habit of poking fun at Shadowland's [[drama]].  Shortly before leaving, the founder had stated that "Those '''losers like Snaitn''' are ruining the place."  Thus, the LLS was born.  Their mission was to [[troll]] the overly dramatic and local cybersex fiends.  Then the site's drama queens picked up on this trend, began harassing everyone and turned trolling into an [[old meme]].

=== Nicepair ===
Similar to [[goatse]] and [[lemonparty]], nicepair was a disturbing pornographic image used to haze newbies.  Nicepair was also used to vandalize other peoples' user pages for the [[lulz]] or the [[drama]].
