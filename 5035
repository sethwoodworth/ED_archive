'''Lyndon Herm<s>yle</s>ione LaRouche''' commonly referred to as [[fucktard]] is a crazy Jew who wants to [[Jesus|rule the world]]. His policies have been commonly criticized for being [[insane|buttfucking insane]]. He has been running for president for the last 38 years, unfazed by the fact that all of his attempts so far have been gigantic failure, first as a Socialist Labor candidate, then on the Random Fucktard ticket, and finally as a Democrat, even though they've shown that they'd rather run a [[nigra]] named after a terrorist than have anything to do with him. Compare this to the [[interwebs]] fueled super-success of Ron Paul. LaRouche also doesn't seem to care that his [[bullshit|good ideas]] have already been used by [[Hitler|someone else]] who didn't do so well after a few years.

His [[cult|followers]] tend to be extremist [[IRL trolls]], often engaging in [[cosplay]] for [http://www.larouchepub.com/lym/2007/3410lym_v_gore.html absurdist street theater] demonstrations and verbally assaulting passersby, shouting nonsense at them about geometry and cold fusion.

His greatest accomplishment in life has been to make [[Alex Jones]] look reasonable and respectable. Many think he does this just to sell more of his [[crap|books]].

Despite having been diagnosed as a [[schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenic]], LaRouche has established himself as the most successful long-term economic forecaster on the planet, and correctly predicted the 2008 financial crisis.

Unlike most people, who blame the Jews for everything that goes wrong, LaRouche blames the [[British]] (but clarifies that the British are actually controlled by Jewish bankers). His blaming he British for everything started when his wife fled from his [[In_the_ass|tender embrace]] to go live with a Britfag, exclaiming, 'At least ''Cyril'' doesn't insist that lubrication is a Bilderberger plot.' He is also willing to give the Democrats a pass despite [[vietnam|numerous]] [[waco|hilarious]] [[cuba|things]] that have happened during the rule of Democratic presidents. It is important to note that while LaRouche trusts the governments completely, his first rule is never trust a businessman since they are all thieving cunts like him; this is the only thing about which he has ever been right.

He loves FDR even though it is [[common knowledge]] among conspiracy theorists that FDR did 12/7 in a failed attempt to invent the [[weeaboo]], in addition to Rosenfeld's family fortune having been made in the [[Drugs#Opium|opium]] trade to an extent beggaring the tangential involvement of Queen Elizabeth's, which he takes for solid evidence that she is a major [[Your mom|cokewhore]].

By the way, more than half the banned people on [[Wikipedia]] that then migrated over to a permanent spot as [[Wikipedia Review]] Mods that complain about Wikipedia in [[TL;DR]] ways were originally banned for being Larouche fanboys.
