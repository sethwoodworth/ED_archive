To the max
[[Image:Pathetic.jpg|thumb|......to the Max.]]
Taking something '''to the max''' makes it much, much more of whatever it is. It was also Pepsi's attempt to advertise to the [[EXTREME|X-Treme]] sector of Generations X & Y, but nobody took that seriously.


{{quote3|'''Usage:'''<br>
'''[[Gamer]]:''' ''you got [[pwned|gibbed]] to the max.''<br>
'''[[Emo]]-[[cunt]] girl to [[Suicidal]]-[[douchebag]] boy:''' ''We should cut each other to the max.''}}


You may also hear terms like ''"page five balls to the wall to the max EXTREME!"''. This is something that your typical [[forum]] douchebag might say. It implies that as soon as page five [of a thread] appears you are supposed to say ''"what you really mean"''. In other words everyone blows each others [[e-penis]] until page five comes around. In theory. In reality it ends up being a massive faggot-ass cyber-orgy. 

Some would say that ''"to the max"'' came from a fucktard who thinks his opinions matter on a G4 TTV show called 
X-Play where one of the characters would come up with something like:

{{tinyquote|A fully automatic rocket launcher that shoots chainsaws, except it has katanas where the blades should be, and when it hits something it sets off a massive nuclear explosion in my ass leaving cancerous radiation throughout a radius of [[OVER 9000]] miles; but it is okay since I can fly. That is to the max."}}

''To the max'' is only said (non-jokingly) by [[faggots]], [[Nazis]], and [[American]] [[jocks|males]] in [[Hollywood]] movies.
