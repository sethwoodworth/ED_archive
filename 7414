[[File:Shakesville_we_can_eat_ourselves_to_death.jpg|thumb|If by "it" you mean "get disgustingly fat", then yes, you can do it. This is the kind of images you find on Shakesville, on a New Year, seriously [http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2011/01/happy-new-year.html]]]

[http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/ Shakesville] (aka Rapesville) is a blog where fat apologists and [[almost raped|almost rape]] survivors go to get [[Shocked and Appalled|triggered and outraged]]. The website is made by and for perpetual victims, these people will find rape in the word "grape" and point out that eating grapes contributes to "rape culture"; they will also claim that someone on the Internet calling them fat is a proof that there's a systematic genocide against fat people. They are totally not exaggerating and overreacting.

Run by Melissa McEwan (alias Melissa [[McDonald's|McDonalds]]), the website was started when she lost her job at an all-you-can-eat buffet after it went bankrupt due to a series of mysterious food disappearances. The case was never solved. Authorities are still baffled about where 10 tons of food went to.


==Rape fan-fiction==


Melissa is a chocolate addict. You know someone LOVES their chocolate when you can spot acne on their face on a black-and-white [[fat girl angle shot|fat-angle]] 100x100 pixels avatar. But there's something Melissa likes even more than chocolate, and it is finding [[Almost raped|rape]] where there's none, and then posting on her blog about how she is being a victim of it. 

The ugly behemoth has the nerve to claim that she lives in a constant fear of rape, even though no self-respecting rapist would come closer than a mile because of the rancid smell of grease, sweat and stale urine her lard-ass body emanates. Despite this fact, she loves to dwell endlessly on how she was raped by her imaginary boyfriend who she has been dating for two years.

Melissa can find rape in the most unusual places, like this XKCD webcomic ([http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2009/09/comic-fail.html]). She is totally not batshit insane. [[File:Melissa mcewan thinks this comics is about rape.png]]

By the way, if you don't see rape in this strip, then according to Melissa you're a rapist. 




==Today in fat culture==

Weighting over 9000 kilos, and approaching at rapid pace the mass of the sun, Liss is a vocal fat apologist. A recurring theme of her site is a fat denial. It's a game where the shakers (her blog lusers) try to come up with as many excuses as possible to justify why it's someone else's fault that they're "big-boned". Pointing out that 100% of fat enters through the mouth, and that doing excersize burns the fat, will get you banned from commenting. When the game ends, the users usually share recipes, most of which consist of cakes [http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2009/08/beet-season-birthday-cake.html] [http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2009/03/shaker-gourmet-bastable-cake.html] and fried food [http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/02/shaker-gourmet-chicken-fried-chicken.html]. Hey, no wonder they're fat, look at the crap they eat all day long!

Liss often repeats that being fat is a valid choice, and that others lifestyle is none of your fucking business. Yet, she then goes on to bitch and complain about how the society shouldn't be heteronormative, how some dudes shouldn't use ableist language, and how some folks shouldn't consider obese people disgusting. So she can sit on her oversized ass all day long and be an eye-sore to everybody around, and that is a valid choice, but the whole society must change when she is offended by something. Why the double-standard, Liss?




==Random Melissa McEwan facts==

* Melissa will claim that she is fat because of a medical condition and that she eats healthy and exercises regularly... while snacking on processed food in front of her computer. 

* Six trees must be cut down to produce enough toilet paper for Melissa to wipe her ass once.

* Scientists have concluded that if Melissa skips three out of her sixteen daily snacks for a week, world hunger could be solved.

* Melissa hoards animals because no man has ever loved her.

* Melissa and her fellow sheeple expect to brainwash the society into believing that fat is beautiful using "teaspoon by teaspoon" method [http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2010/01/shaxicon.html]. Ironically, teaspoon by teaspoon is how she and her followers got disgustingly fat in the first fucking place.

* Melissa wants the society to have a better opinion on fat people, but instead of doing something really awesome so the society will be like "Woah, fat people can be really cool, maybe I was wrong about them", she does nothing but whine, bitch, complain, and play the victim, further solidifying the perception that obese persons are good-for-nothing fucks, akin to blacks.


==Batshit insane quotes from Melissa==

{{quote|"It's something, 'date rape' I guess, but it's not rape unless I say it was, right?"â€”Wrong. If you didn't give your consent, and especially if you said no "a bunch of times" and then fell asleep, then it was rape. | Melissa, explaining to a younger (and hotter) girl that even if the girl doesn't consider the experience to be a rape, it is still rape. The nerve!|

==Internet reactions to Shakesville/Melissa McEwan==

{{quote|Grow the fuck up or get the hell off the Internet, because you're only going to continually get offended, be triggered, or whatever it is that you in particular do. And no one beyond your close-minded bootlicks give half a shit what you think, you ignorant bonehead. People can say what they want - shock, horror - and you need to deal. On the flip-side, I guess you can continue screeching about whatever sets you off, too, but just remember that no one with half a brain cares. Because nothing you have said in regards to this issue was at all new, insightful, meaningful, or relevant. The only thing anyone will get out of this is, "God damn there are a lot more humorless cunts in the world than I thought there were."

In short, I hope something pushes you far enough that you kill yourself. I'm tired of assholes breathing my air.|Captain Awesome, telling the whiny little girl Melissa to grow up. Man, did he summarize this whole article in just a couple of lines with the eloquence of Shakespeare!}}


{{quote|Well, Shakespeare's Sister is just a giant, ongoing outrage treadmill. The site does not exist for communication or engagement, it exists to make its readers feel righteously outraged.|Quoted for truth}}

==Trolling Shakesville==

Melissa McEwan likes to think that her blog is a "safe place for rape survivors" because any content that a rape sur-whiner may find offending is labeled as "warning trigger: rape culture" or "trigger: sexual violence". The theory behind it is that the reader will read the warning and skip the article that may trigger the unpleasant emotion. Too bad 100% of her readers visit the blog to get a daily dose of unpleasant emotions, mainly rage. In this sense, Shakesville is like 4chan and ED for emotionally disturbed women. 


On Shakesville, expressing any opinion that differs from the opinion of the hivemind will immediately get you banned. Liss routinely trolls her own readers into blind rage with her posts, but she will delete your comment because she can't stand the competition. Despite this, trolling is still possible:



'''Method 1 - Creative trolling:'''

Pretend to be a rape survivor, and write a most ridiculous rape fan-fiction you can think of. No matter how batshit crazy your story is, shakers will swallow it up if you insert plenty of hot and juicy rape love into the prose. 

Or if you're feeling lazy, post "OMG!!! READ THIS, THIS IS HORRIBLE!", and include a bit.ly link that points to this article (or pretty much any article on ED). Don't forget to tag it properly (example: trigger - tentacle rape!!!). Then sit and watch the comments. Melissa herself does this all the time, because it works.


'''Method 2 - Rape irl:'''

This one requires some more work, but also has more potential for the lulz:

# Find where Melissa McEwan lives
# Raep
# ???
# Profit

Being the author of a popular white-heterosexual-male-hating website, it's only a matter of time before someone discovers where she lives and rapes her. Do it before someone else does! Be the pioneer!!! 

If you lack the haxx0r and social engineering skills necessary to find Liss's address, pick a shaker who commented and who has a website listed, extract their info from whois database, Facebook, or a phone book, then proceed to raep. Be sure to check it's not a [[transvestite|trap]] before sexing though, unless you are a fag, in which case you may skip this step. For bonus points after the deed is done, email Melissa McEwan at Melissa.McEwan@hotmail.com telling her that you found your victim through her website. Many lulz will be had.
