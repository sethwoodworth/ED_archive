=A Non-Community  of Dunces=
The Birmingham [[pagan]] community is a contradiction in terms on two points, since they are neither pagan (paganism in England having been extinct for about [[100|a hundred years]] times ten) nor a community. However, as everybody from Birmingham is an idiot, their historical ignorance can be  mocked.

==Deities==
They have three gods, one vegetative (the Vegetentacle Rapist), and two rotting: [[Period|menstrual blood]] and the viscera, decapitated heads, etc. of suitably small animals. They absolutely love menstrual blood and do lots of stuff with it: they eat food containing menstrual blood, especially cakes, sniff or snort menstrual blood, lick menstrual blood up, put it in their bathtubs, etc.

==Playtime==
Brum pagans have an amazingly diverse range of leisure activities and loads of free time to enjoy them, fitting their image as sucklings on the rotting tits of [[Tony Blair|'Cool Brittania']]. 
When they're not lining up  for 'social' (handouts from the [[Government|gummint]]) they pretend to have [[Lemon party|orgies]] in front of old rocks assembled by people who aren't even their relatives. As part of their '[[religion]]', they enjoy eating, drinking and sniffing menstrual blood. Some of them would like to indulge in a little human sacrifice, like the ancient druids, but they are too [[politically correct]] for that. Even worse, too many of their members are also in [[PETA]] or otherwise [[vegetarian]].

[[Image:Cracky-Chan 22.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cracky-chan]] is '''absolutely not a Brum pagan''' and doesn't seem to have claimed she'd smeared menstrual blood on her face (that comment was abt. her topless shots) but if she had, Brum pagans want to lick it off or collect it for their revolting cakes!]]

When they are drunk or excited they run around screaming about how they are Brum pagans, for example: 

''Oi, oi, oi, Brum pagans are we, fuck you up the snotty nose, we love menstrual blood!''

when they 'tool up' to support their soon to be relegated and fifth-rate [[soccer]] team Arsetown Vile, a club that share's their over inflated egos and sense of self worth.

===Playtime on  Encyclopædia Dramatica===
When they aren't being vege-tentacle raped, torturing small animals, consuming menstrual blood in one way or another, queuing for handouts, or taking drugs, Brum pagans like to get on Æ and [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Acropolis_now&oldid=1997045381 fling shit] [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Sutri&oldid=1997046363 at each other]. They even hurl each others [[power word|real names]] around as if there were no tomorrow. Of course, Encyclopædia Dramatica's highly ethical no-real-names policy means that we can't give examples of this.

Still, it all ends up in tears and [[User: Mr6|threats]]. 

They also seem to particularly love [[Garwy|this man]] or perhaps [[Dharmahorsey|this one]]. Regardless, he's probably a lot nicer than them. They say he is a minister of the [[church]] (no doubt theirs) and beg to have at least one of his pages taken off; they are probably only frightened that he'll put a 'hex' on them.

===Brum Pagans on Æ in No Particular Order===

[[User: Saviourgirl|Saviourgirl]],
[[User talk: Crazymadsylvia|Crazymadsylvia]],
[[User: Mr6|Mr6]] (not to be confused with the real Mister Six),
[[User: Goldenflea|Goldenflea]],
[[User talk: The Buddha|The Buddha]],
[[User: The Watcher|The Watcher]],
[[User talk: Sylviaread|Sylviaread]], and
[[User talk: Johnread|Johnread]] are  all [[Insane|batshit crazy]] Brum pagans!

Watch out! One or two have naively been asked to Lurk Moar!, and [[they]] have, casting a foul odour of bad menses-laden breath over AE. They even pop up on TJC from time to time, posing as legitimate Æ users.
