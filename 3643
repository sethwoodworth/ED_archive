'''''Have I Got News For You''''' is a [[satire|satirical]] [[Britain|britfag]] [[television]] [[orgy|panel show]], that is is considered to be one of the greatest bringers of [[lulz]] and [[drama]] to the [[British]] public. Beginning as a cheap piece of shit to undercut Spitting Image's success the show features Paul Merton and Ian Hislop as team captains with a [[fag|guest host]] - following the drama surrounding <S>presenter</s> <s>disgraced</s> legendary [[Hookers_and_blow|coke snorting and hooker fucking]] former-presenter Angus Deayton. The show (that has been running ever since [[England]] won the World Cup in 1966) is particularly [[Wikipedia|notable]] for skirting [[gay|very close]] to <s>libel</s> it's slander if they SAY things like princess di was a hooker you bell end laws, and it is a [[meme|running joke]] that particularly scurrilous accusations are suffixed with the word "allegedly". Other [[memes]] have included the [[lie|fact]] that Angus Deayton was fucking Paul Merton's wife, ridiculing the Deputy Prime Minister for being a [[fat|fat fuck]] and insisting that [[Princess Diana]] and the Duchess of York (amongst other [[women]]) are [[fat|"over-blown tarts"]].

Because the BBC are not [[faggots]] like Viacom, clips from the show are [http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Have+I+Got+News+For+You&search=Search all over YouTube] so that [[Americunts]] can start to understand that ''[[The Daily Show]]'' isn't actually that funny.

==Cocaine & Hookers != job at BBC==

It came as a shock to many, as most people know that [[gossip|surveys]] have shown that 50% of the BBC are coke addicts, however <S>presenter</s> <s>disgraced</s> legendary former-presenter Angus Deayton was sacked in 2002 when his position became "untenable" after being caught [[Hookers_and_blow|snorting coke and fucking a hooker]]. In this instance the definition of "untenable" is "(adj): getting [[troll|trolled]] liek fuck by everyone on the show". It should be mentioned that the hooker in question hadn't been paid for by Angus Deayton, but was paid for by [[Faux News|tabloid journalists]] as part of a [[Chris Hansen|sting operation]].

However this did provide the British public with one of the greatest pieces of [[THE POWER OF ONLINE VIDEO COMMUNICATION|television]] [[drama]] the BBC has ever produced. Sadly it also led to the rise of Boris Johnson - who despite being a very good troll, [[some argue|will probably]] become [[W|inept]] as [[president|mayor]] of [[London]].

==Fact of the day==

As part of the Dadaist theatre movement[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada], the entire script of "Have I Got News For You" is repeated on BBC Radio with exactly the same [[loser|jokes]] under the name [[unfunny|"The News Quiz"]]. In a [[So i herd u liek mudkip|surreal]] twist the radio version is hosted by [[ball|Ian Hislop]] dressed as a [[lesbian|woman]], whilst [[Paul Reubens|Paul Merton]] warms up the studio audience by [[cunnilingus|tonguing]] BBC radio announcer [[Ashlee_Simpson|Charlotte Green]] live on stage.
