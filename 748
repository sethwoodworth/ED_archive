[[BBC]] Radio 4 unlike much of its other counterparts such as [[Chavs|Radio 1]], serves as an outlet for broadcasting a range of [[Shit nobody cares about|extremely educational and thought provoking articles]] to the general public. Tuning in is akin to a game of Russian roulette, where upon the listener will be subjected to learning how it was to be a [[You|lesbian]] in the 1980s or [[Shit nobody cares about|taught precisely how an 19th century cart is constructed.]] Needless to say, Radio 4 will only be of interest if you are middle class or a complete and utter [[You|faggot.]] Since [[Suicide|euthanasia]]  is illegal in [[britain]] Radio 4 is also used as its alternative, though unlike [[Suicide|euthanasia]] takes several years to work and is infinitely painful.

==Regular Programs==
Along with random [[Shit nobody cares about|articles]]Radio Bore also host a variety of other [[Goatse|shows]] in which <s>boring old pensioners</s> individuals of superior intellect talk about more [[Shit nobody cares about|incredibly interesting things.]] Amongst the shows there are however some that are actually [[lulz|funny]], though again probably only to [[Educated|Middle class]] people.

===Just A Minute===

A programme in which mainly [[Britfag|British]] comedians and [[Homosexuals|actors]] are challenged to talk for a full minute about [[Shit nobody cares about|even more exciting topics.]] The show generally generates many [[lulz]], mostly from high brow humour involving grammar, because [[You|someone]] interrupted for no reason or that [[You|someone]] broke the rules and fucked up, upon which the person who pointed out the fuck up continues talking about the subject for remaining time. Better than crack.

In a recent [[Retarded|special]] [[Homosexual|Political]] Edition, [[George Osborne]] of the [[Satanist|Conservative Party]] apparently managed to speak for thirty seconds but it transpired he was merely blubbing because Peter Mandelsohn pointed out that [[David Cameron|Cameron]] will never love [[You|him]].

===The Today Programme===

A political sketch show in which [[Inbred|regional]] presenters slap famous people around the head with their metaphorical [[cocks]] to discuss [[Shit nobody cares about|current and relevant topics]]. John Humphries the shows host, notorious ladies man and host of  [[Masturbate|Mastermind]], is well known for having a one foot penis, and once [[Lie|accidentally]] took Edwina Currie's eye out during a heated argument about [[England|Welsh]] cakes.

===Church Bells on Sunday===

Literally the sound of [[Christ-fag|church]] bells ringing on Sunday from around the [[Britain|country]]. I shit you not.


===Gardeners' Question Time===

How to be a success at growing [[marijuana|various plant life]] in your garden, with a panel of experts [[Shit nobody cares about|giving tips on everything from which soil type if appropriate for a birch tree, to whether a certain type of rose requires much daylight or not]]. A reminder that whilst Britain ruled the fucking world with an iron fist, its inhabitants sat back and did a spot of light gardening.

===The Archers===

A never ending play in which the residents of a generic rural community go around doing various fun things <s>again and again and just wont shut up and oh god its all so fucking mundane</s>. Due to the programs never ending nature it is mostly listened to by people who were caught in its spell and can't stop listening or by [[Death|older persons]] who are trying to escape death by being absorbed into the programs infinite presence in the world.

===Nature===

It's about nature.

===Desert Island Disks===

One of the other arguably good shows on Radio Bore, in which [[Faggots|famous people]] talk about their favourite music and play a few tracks for the listeners, notable shows include when Quentin Tarintino turned up and bragged about his massive [[Cock|music collection.]]
