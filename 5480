[[Image:Moot hitler.png|thumb|Moot addressing the masses of [[4chan]].]]
'''moot''' (AKA '''m00t''', '''m00tle''', '''m♥♥t''', '''Doug''', <span style="color:red;">'''mοοt''' !Εр8рui8Vw2 ­'''##''' '''Αdmіn'''</span> and (the) '''faggot''', "[[lies|real]]" name '''[[CP|Christopher Poole]]''' (aka '''Chris Poole''') or '''Robert Goin''' or [[DUN DUN|Rick Benson]]), is a [[Faggot|completely respectable human being]] who, after turning into a swan and raping the maiden [[Internets]], conceived [[4chan]]. It offers free [[porn]] of multitudinous varieties, but, like a pay-per-view phoenix, dies every new moon and must be resurrected by shedding the blood of a donator. 
 
Moot then takes this money and flees to Cancun, [[Mexico]]; also known as [[Mootxico]]. He has prepared for this by graduating from grade school with a degree in [[bullshit|Mexican studies]]. All the while spreading a deadly concoction of [[diabetes]], [[cancer]], [[AIDS]], and [[epic fail]] which combined to form [[swine flu]].

In addition, his life goal is to be [[Bottom|the little girl]].

Lately his popularity has changed due to him becoming an awkward [[fucktard]] who [[Unrealistic Expectations|thinks]] he is an [[Internets]] [[celebrity]], making [[4chan]] his own personal army and make anonymous look like dangerous [[HACKERS ON STEROIDS]].

Moot, the supreme overlord of the Internet that he is, is responsible for [[b/-day|/b/-day]] in which the [[pedophiles]] of [[4chan]] were exiled from the land of milk and honey known as [[B|/b/]], and cast out into the cesspool known as [[Anontalk.com]]. Unfortunately the wrath of Moot was indiscriminate, as his [[cock|banhammer of massive girth]] fell too hard on too broad a landscape, so as a result unsuspecting /b/tards who were not to blame for any illegal content posted on 4chan were also banished from [[b|/b/]] resulting in a massive rebellion against [[fag|Lord]] Moot. More information can be found on the [[b day|/b/-day]] page.  
<div style="position:absolute; bottom:0; right:0">[[Image:moot_approves.png|160px|Moot approves]] </div>
However, in December 07, moot's castle of [[hentai]], [[AIDS]], and [[Caturday|cat macros]] was [[THE_GREAT_CHAN_OUT_OF_07|taken from him]], forcing him to live as just another [[fag|gay person on the internet]] for a few days.

Lately however, Moot is back from Mootxico after his [[Brb soup|soup-binge]] and homo erotic adventures. But, does he have any [[IRL]] friends? NO?! OMFG ARE YOU SURPRISED! Did you learn anything from the above? Moot likes to take credit for starting [[Anonymous]], but it was actually [[Shii]] who started it on his own imageboard and then convinced moot to implement it on 4chan's [[b/|/b/]]. [http://wakaba.c3.cx/shii/]

Moot's tripcode is #faggot, if for some reason you didn't know. [[Image:Eatthisfag.PNG]] [[Image:Eatthisfag2.PNG]] Also a permaban if you try to use it, so <s>don't do it</s> [[DO IT FAGGOT]]

Did you know that even though moot almost never answers his emails, [[:Kimmo Alm Emails|he saves every email that he gets forever]]?

As of late he has been fagging up [[/r9k/]] with his sticky threads; the most recent claiming to have a girlfriend, however this is a lie, because as we all know: moot is a faggot ([[Not gay|not that there's anything wrong with that]]).

==Retirement ([[copypasta]])==
[[Image:1256599980824.jpg|thumb|Will it come true?]]
[[Image:Mootassasinated.jpg|thumb|right|Killed by his own weapon]]

So I know moot, we went to high school together and my little brother just about worships the guy and spends way too much time on 4chan. I was never into anime, because I am not a gigantic faggot, and i never really looked at 4chan except for /ck/, but anyway last night i called moot because my brother wanted to know wtf was up and moot said we should come over to his parents house (he has a swanky apartment near the servers in downtown Dallas, but its not very big. Great building, though). So i got my little brother and a couple six packs of lone star and some kirins and went over. There was maybe a dozen people over and when we came in, moot who was drinking soup, told us 4chan was over and he wanted it to out like it started, without much fanfare. He said that he'd banked enough money from it (almost three million after taxes he said) and after the latest terrorist scare of 4chan origin this week he was afraid that he'd lose it to government fines or lawyers somehow and that he enough money for the rest of his life now anyway. Then he went on about how since 4chan got so big he didn't have any time to have fun, but he didn't want to sell it and see his creation turned into corporate crap, so he just pulled the plug (he was a huge nirvana fan in high school, so at least he didn't suck on a twelve gauge) before it got completely out of control. Then he talked to my brother about anime for like an hour. Apparently, he was trying to get brought up to speed after missing out for a couple years. He said he is considering moving to Japan and writing or producing anime designed for western audiences and the 4chan servers will be auctioned at the beginning of next year and maybe the domain as well. My little brother was trying to show off or some shit and pounded one too many and puked on the kitchen floor so i threw him in the car and went home. Anyway, I thought you would want to know about this, so here it is. TL;DR

==IRL name==
[[Image:Mootcambridge.JPG|thumb|moot on a roof. (in Cambridge)]]
Anonymous, with their desire to hunt down moot for his [[cock]], found out that he was raised in Springfield, Illinois. At first, it was assumed that moot's name was Richard [[cock|Goin]], based off a Google search, since Google always tells the [[lies|truth]]. However, [http://www.flickr.com/photos/crimsonninjagirl/2502634083/ further investigation] into the [[camwhore|camwhoring]] of his friends shows that moot's first name is actually Robert, and that his friends are [http://www.flickr.com/photos/crimsonninjagirl/page92/ in fact closeted furries].

Further research has revealed that Richard Robert Goins is not in fact moot's real name, but it is his porn name.  In porn, moot for unknown reasons always wears his baseball cap. It is his signature style no other adult film star has had before. moot currently resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts (see image on top right).

==Impersonation==
[[File:Hey guys im the real moot posting.jpg|thumb|right|One goes through extra moot impersonation effort with making the moot mask!]]
[[Image:Mootstatue.jpg|thumb|The only true Moot.]]
[[Image:Moot_the_camwhore.jpg|thumb|moot actually delivers for once in his faggy life (Nice [[YTMND]] shirt, nerd). (is fake moot though)]]
Since 4chan began until early 2009, 4chan had no rule against moot impersonation and on /b/ it clearly was allowed by the rules. Eventually moot noticed this, although he'd always ban for it. The other moderators never have and never will ban for it--all bans for this are from moot and they're only for moot impersonation, never [[W.T. Snacks]] impersonation.

moot is a [[pretty cool guy|pretty laid back guy]], but when someone impersonates him, he becomes insanely furious. Why? Nobody knows. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and yet moot gets just as enraged over moot impersonation as [[Chris-chan‎]] and [[The Real Chris Chan‎]] get over Chris-chan impersonation.

Originally, moot impersonation was as easy as this:

[[Image:How to be moot.gif|center|none|200px]]

But over time moot has been working to stop it. Techniques still exist but whenever they're posted on ED, moot quickly blocks them due to the flood of [[newfag]]s not knowing when to and when not to use them.

==The mystery of his sexual preference==
[[Image:Mootmootmooot.jpg|thumb|right|That's right, the guy who owns 4chan is a fag.]]
[[Image:Moot 4chan lol.png|thumb|right|This is a real quote.]]
Question is: is moot [[homosexual]] or [[homosexual|bisexual]]?

The answer remains a mystery because moot has never replied to this. Nonetheless, moot occasionally tries to solicit dates on 4chan with hilarious consequences when people guess his sexual preference wrong.

[[Image:Gay moot is gay 2.jpg|center|frame|/page.  And as you can see, moot always has his hat on when doing porn.]]
[[Image:Mootpro.jpg|thumb|People get gay for his pronunciations.]]
[[Image:Mootdoitfaggot.jpg|thumb|[[Cockmongler|moot]] [[DO IT FAGGOT|giving you the message.]]]]
[[Image:IDONOTCARE.jpg|thumb|moot lays down the law to an unsuspecting camwhore.]]
[[Image:Moot_bans_fuckhead.PNG|thumb|moot lays the fuckdown.]]
<br/><br/>

Moot is well known as a homosexual:
*He often will kiss other men.
*He says he wants to be the little girl.
*He crossdresses, usually sexually in crotchless outfits.
*Even when he doesn't crossdress, he wears lots of pink and he wears women's makeup that at the very least makes his checks extra rosy.
*He repeatedly bans female camwhores saying he doesn't care and when a male hits on moot, moot replies back eagerly and then stickies the post.
*He says he wants to be the little girl.
*He is seen in photos hanging around with hot girls and not showing any sign of attraction to them.
*He is too well groomed for a straight man.
*He says he wants to be the little girl.
*And then of course there's his tripcode...
[[Image:Moot-faggot.png|center]]

moot, though, is the only man in existence who can pull off being both cool and a #faggot at the same time.

==Summer '08==
[[Image:Bnd.JPG|thumb|right|My father...was Moot...]]
These days moot is seen a lot more on 4chan, sticking every thread he posts in on [[B|/b/]] and [[R9gay|/r9k/]] and leaving it there for days for all to be blessed by his presence. He has also been spotted updating the news page and [[desperate|asking people to read it]] and occasionally showing up in the weekly Midnight [[W. T. Snacks|Snacks]] threads on /r9k/ and [[Banhammer|banning]] anyone who says anything about [[Buttsex|his past with Snacks]]. Moot recently trolled 4chan, especially /b/, by giving an interview in the ''[[Capitalism|Wall Street Journal]]'' about 4chan where he released his [[Powerword|real name]], and later stating on 4chan that "Christopher Poole" was just an act of trolling. 

Many /b/tards with half a brain were able to see this for what it was, a lame-assed attempt to cover his tracks, as moot [[Bullshit|would not lie]] to the ''Wall Street Journal''. For moot, as a wannabe [[camwhore]], would not want to [[Troll|piss off]] a reporter and jeopardize [[attention whore|future interviews]]. The result is that he will be promptly [[SWATing|SWAT]]ted just like [[Kirtaner]] was. This is expected to result in a surge of [[newfags]] on the site, much to the [[butthurt|dismay]] of many /b/tards.

==Epic raid==
On November 9th, 2008, moot posted a number of threads pretty much showing how much of a camwhore he is, so /b/tards took [[raid|initiative]] and began posting numerous threads similar to moot's, only to receive the banhammer, but was pretty funny while it lasted. For some reason people kept thinking these trolls were moot and were subsequently trolled themselves. Below is an example of this:

[[Image:mootlolol.jpg|thumb|middle|<s>Moot is back for 2009, bitches! Let the b&ing begin!1!!!!1!!1one!!1</s> fucking trolled idiot, you get banned in the post body, NOT the subject line]]

On February 17th, 2009, moot found himself gracing the front page of the style/culture section of the ''The Washington Post''.  Drawing on his appearance at [[ROFLCon|ROFL Thing]] this year, the article is basically the same as the ''[[Time Magazine]]'' article published last year, apart from the revelation that despite the growing [[SSP|publicity]] the internet's "master of memes" has received in the last year and a half and the lucrative [[Jew gold|ad revenues]] he's been pulling in due to 4chan's ever-growing [[newfags|popularity]], he's been unable to secure a job [[IRL]], still [[basement dweller|living]] with his mom, and [[poverty|20k in debt]]. TL;DR: moot is in for tough times, [[hookers and blow|where did it all go?]].
*[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/16/AR2009021601565.html?hpid=sec-tech ''Washington Post'' article] - "His real name is Christopher Poole." 

On the bright side for mootle, ''Time Magazine'' has decided to suck his muddy cock even more, and included him on the '''voting list''' of [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1883644_1883653_1885481,00.html ''Time''`s 100 Most Influential People]. Wait, what?

As of April 27th [[Fag|Moot]] IS ''Time Magazine'''s World's Most Influential person. A ''Time Magazine'' editor had this to say, "I know it was rigged but he just would not stop offering to suck my cock. So, I finally let him and JESUS CHRIST, [[shit was so cash]]. Why do you think he won by such a wide margin?" I wonder if he got the stains out?
[[Image:TIME results moot.jpg|center|500px]]

==2012 Election Nominee==
[[Troll the vote]] is up comingcampaign started on 4chan. As of 2012 moot will be 25, which is the age where he is a legal candidate for the house of Representatives.
