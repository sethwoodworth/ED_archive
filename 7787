'''Staredad''' is an [[exploitable]] [[meme]] from a KC Green [[webcomic]] entitled ''Dad Wasps Oh No''. In this [[short]] webscomic, a timid child is scared by wasps in his room, so he runs to his [[father]] in hopes of a [[white knight]]. His irritated father then deals with the wasps like a pro and disowns his son by screaming, ''I HAVE NO SON''. Of course, the [[Anonymous|good people of the Internet]] realized that the webcomic wasn't funny, so they decided to remove the wasps and focus [[witty]] dialogue instead. The result was [[success]] as the father always had [[Ralph|something interesting to say]] (well, at least until it [[Newfags|became overused]]).
