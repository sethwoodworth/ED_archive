The Daily Show Experience
[http://tdsexperience.com/index.php The Daily Show Experience] was originally intended as a chat board for [[The Daily Show]] [[fan]]s but it was soon overrun by drooling [[neo-con]] [[troll]]s searching for fresh meat when Comedy Central realized they could not be controlled and shut down the official board in fear and despair. Since The Daily Show fans are usually dope-smoking [[commie]] pacifists, the [[drama]] began at once and has continued over the course of five years.

== Major Players ==
'''Jillsmo''' -- Kind and good-humored, jillsmo is the worst [[moderator]] in the world, allowing all and sundry to speak their mind, even when they have none. 

'''Sleepercell''' AKA Osama bin Laden AKA Saddam Hussein AKA ButtfuckingMonkeyLord
Senile crank who has been exploring the humorous side of anal sex for going on ten years. Counting on his readers to have a sense of decency, he delights in replying to posts with long strings of obscenities, usually describing close contact between their mothers and goats in vivid detail. Expresses contempt and hatred for all mankind and means it. While [[conservative]]s make him pray for a quick and torturous end to the world, expressing friendship for him drives him into a misanthropic frenzy of creative vulgarity. Handle with care.

'''Read Between The Lines''' 
An illiterate hairdresser who believes that folks staring at books must be deciphering secret messages she cannot see hidden in the white space. To make up for her inability to read or write, she posts poorly rendered cartoons, usually of goats mating. Most are baffled until it is revealed she is one of the goats and just wants to share.

'''Rards'''
A typical conservative, Rards is an unemployed Texan but sure the booming economy will turn up a good job for him any day now. He has been sure of this for five years. He lives in his mother's basement and is still a [[virgin]]. No, really. Ask him, he'll tell you it's true. He is saving himself for the day he meets [[Ann Coulter]] because he imagines no other [[vagina]] has just the right political slant. An [[obsessive-compulsive]], he will helplessly reply to any message that uses his name, even if it says "I'll bet you have to reply to this, don't you, Rards, you poor virgin fool?" His replies run to several chapters long and he can be whipped into a bubbly vanilla froth of fury if the other poster makes it clear they read nothing but the closing line, and they thought that was stoopid.

'''The Cast of The Daily Show'''
Once a day, a lurker from The Daily Show drops by long enough to read the threads, or so the moderator reports based on IP address. This is probably true, as Jon Stewart will occasionally make on-air reference to "those [[wackjob]]s on the internet."

The board seems to feature an ever-changing cast of buffoons and the emotionally disturbed, though it is possible it is just two people constantly changing handles. Many lulz, especially if goat fucking is your favorite hobby.
