Post in this thread if (x)
'''Post in this thread if (x)''' is by far the [[THE BEST|the best]] of all the current 4chan trends. So you've seen the [[cancer|hilarious]] hi-jinks of [[post ending in (x)]] and have seen the chemo work its magic, but don't want the [[fail|fun]] to end? Fear not. Using the magic of [[ms paint]] there's new [[cancer|awesome]] that anyone can do! Its simple - all you have to do is spend 3 minutes in text editor and post, then wait for the lulz to begin! [[/x/|Be not afraid]], because at current average 1 out of every [[OVER 9000|9]] threads is '''Post in this thread if (x)''', and the mods are [[Bring Back Snacks|living it up]]. 

==Tumors==
Note: Early estimates are that this cancer is ''malignant''', its so easy to do any [[unfunny]] [[newfag]] can whip out 50 in an hour.

==Chemo?==
'''[[Post_ending_in_(x)_gets_to_name_my_(x)#The_Banning|The Great Autoban]]''' is a good sign but the mods most likely wont do [[shit]].
