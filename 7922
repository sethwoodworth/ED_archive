According to the [[United States]] [[Dungeons_%26_Dragons|Constitution]], the [[W|President]] is appointed by a body of nine [[old]] rich [[white]] [[man|men]] (sometimes [[woman|women]] or black person when a liberal is president but still [[old]] and rich) who are kept alive long past the natural span of mortal years by the [[Chaos magic|Black Arts]]. A vote of 5&ndash;4 is needed to [[pwn]] [[Al Gore]].

Judges to the Supreme Court are appointed [[hitler|for life]]. This is because the [[ass|President]], who wears the Master Ring, will not release their withered spirits to the peace of the grave. When they get appointed, Congress [[troll|will ask them many difficult questions]] because Congress is full of [[pedophilia|pedophiles]].

Some well known Supreme Court cases include:

[[Brainlesswonder|Roe]] vs. [[Fucktard|Wade]]

[[Hitler]] vs. [[Jews]]

[[Alien]] vs. [[Rape|Predator]]

and the less well known:

[[Conservatism|Conservatives]] vs. Everybody Else
