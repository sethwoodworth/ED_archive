'''OldDirty[[Btard]]''' (November 17, 1960 - October 30, [[2010]]), not to be confused with the far less badass [[dead|Wu-tang Clan]] member, was the most dramatic person to ever control the [[banhammer]] for ED. In short, he was the dos equis guy. Among his notable traits are his being British, having an [[ae]] tattoo, [[LOL WUT|shooting off his own pinky just to watch it die]], getting [[alcohol|DUI's]] on consecutive nights, lieking [[Mudkips]], accidentally inventing the word [[EDiot]], being a [[macfag]] (as he got one for free), having a [[slut|sister]] who appeared naked on the [[gay|Queen]] single Bicycle Race, managing the Jew, shooting up an [[Armenia]]n's car, marrying strippers, working in porn because it was less scummy than the music industry, corrupting his [[underage]] nephew into becoming an internet troll, having his beloved cat killed by [[scientology|Scientologists]] and almost killing himself over it... while being drunk, pilled up and daydreaming about [[ladyboys|Thailand]] the entire time.

You might think this is exaggeration and bullshit, but we're not [[Uncyclopedia]]. This is 100% [[fact|TRUFAX]].

==Pre-ED==
ODB was an [[irl]] [[troll]] back when ED was but a twinkle in [[Girlvinyl]]'s eye. [http://www.beastiemania.com/whois/carasov_sean/ He used to manage the Beastie Boys] and protect everyone's favorite Jews from record company higher-up Jews. 

It was around this 45-year-period that ODB had a falling out with the guy who ran Warner Music Group into the ground, [[Lyor Cohen]]. He wasn't bitter though.

==On Encyclopedia Dramatica==
[[File:Odb odb .jpg|right]]
ODB came to ED on July 15, [[2006]] with [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Troll&diff=prev&oldid=1996969261 this unassuming edit]. His first major article was the since-destroyed [[United States of Americunts]], thanks to an obligatory hatred for everything non-English (and English as well). He's been a major contributor ever since being sysopped. Not long after getting his [[banhammer]], ODB ran his favorite pet project, [[Lulz News Network]] on the ED [[Main Page]]. Like everything else that made the Captain happy, this had to be taken away.

Probably due to his hatred of [[American]]s who pulled off a massive [[troll]] by surrounding his home in [[Los Angeles|HelLA]] as well as his massive alcohol dependency, [[OCD]], and need to feel useful, ODB holds the record for most edits to this hole of a website. Sadly, ODB's ED decline began with the advent of [[MysteryBot]], which basically did everything ODB did for free. ODB invented the term PakiBot for its ability to do the same job for much cheaper.

ODB did everything he could to keep ED alive and thriving in [[2008]], including getting a wave of 13 newbies sysopped and becoming a [[leaderfag]] in the [[chanology]] movement. Since then, ODB has shown his primacy by cutting uppity sysops down to size.

During his stay at ED, ODB always amused [[ED IRC]] with anecdotes of promoting Q-Tip and getting [[eppigy]] to lose his oline on [[Christmas]]. He also notably got arrested for DUI's on consecutive nights (and got off scot free), shot off his pinky to see what it'd feel like, quit [[alcohol]] forever, fell off the wagon 6 months later, shot up an [[Armenia]]n's car for honking too much, and managed to find ED funny despite being nearly 50 years old.

For those who [[slowpoke|weren't aware]], ODB was [[Rorschach]]. Scientologists killed his kitty, Mudkips. Never forget.

{{tinyquote|
ODB is a bitter Socialist who thinks mass suicides would stick it to [[The Man]]. To whit, he wrote this.

In most cases, life is not worth living. The idea that happiness is a raison d'etre logically means that nearly everyone is unhappy (after being born a blank slate). So unhappiness is the norm -the meaning of life- and the quest for happiness is merely a by-product and not our natural condition. Looking for happiness then is not that different than looking for a good drug dealer with good drugs.

99% of human beings serve no real, 'natural' purpose or reason to keep on going through the motions whatsoever. The majority of the world's population is just the means of production by which the few attain "happiness" (altho, I don't know many truly happy rich folk).

Sure most become 'necessary' thanks to manmade things like economies -to make them work- but economies would not be necessary if there were no humans. Pretty much everything we do as humans is built around the notion of perpetuating a species -to the detriment of all others- that has not shown any proof that it deserves a place on this planet as part of the ecosystem.

All the 'good', 'worthwhile' stuff people have done -and continue to do- is only 'good' and 'worthwhile' when put into the context of the human condition/experience. Splitting the atom and curing cancer is pretty useless to every other creature on the planet.

I read a book called "The Sirens of Titan" by Kurt Vonnegut recently and the punchline of the story is that the entire sum of all human knowledge/achievement over thousands of years was little more than a works project by an alien race from another galaxy trying to send a message to one of their own stranded in another galaxy. The message was that they were sending help.

{{quote|Hello, I know most of you are punks who think they are going to troll the
emailing list by saying "cool story bro", but I will still take the time
to inform you that OldDirtyBtard is believed to have killed himself on
Saturday night. ODB was a noted 50 year old English asshole who could make
you laugh. He had been saying he was going to kill himself for a long
time, but was waiting for his cats to die so nothing was depending on him.

ODB was a career alcoholic who quit but got bored with it and went back to
the sauce. Please do a shot in honor of the captain, it's what he would've
wanted.

==Services==
Memorial services were held for The Captain on November 14, 2010 in Los Angeles. Family and friends from all over attended. [[Anon]], [[ED]] and various people from the music industry were also there. It was a wake that Sean himself would have approved of had he been there to see it. Although it didn't get recorded in the video of the services, this was probably the first time in history that a room full of people got [[Rickroll]]ed by a bagpipe player. [[Srsly]].
