'''Jessi Slaughter''' ("'''Kerligirl13'''", [[powerword]]: Jessica Leonhardt) is a [[crazy|disturbed]] [[preteen|11-year-old girl]] posing as a [[16-year-old]], potential [[Maury]] guest and chronic sufferer of [[GOTIS]].  Jessi wants you to know that she is so much [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|prettier than you, has more friends, and more people like her]] and so [[retard|mature]] for her age that her parents, [[dad|Gene]] and [[mom|Dianne]], turn a blind eye when it comes to her [[camwhore|extracurricular activities]]: [[Daddy's money lesbian|partying until she passes out]], [[whore|fucking until she bleeds]] and telling anyone and everyone who'll listen all about her crazy life on [[YouTube]]. 

In mid-July, 2010 Jessi's [[tumblr|considerable body of work]] came to the attention of 4chan's [[b/|Parental Advisory Board]] who -being the [[fapping|diligent, conscientious, upright]] e-citizens they are- thought that her unprotected Internets shenanigans were cause for concern and that [[Gawker|the authorities]], (if not her seemingly [[derp|asleep-at-the-wheel]] parents), should be alerted to what appeared to be a case of either negligent parenting and/or a [[attention whore|cry for help]] from an out of control youngster acting out in cyberspace (where [[aliens|noone]] can hear you scream).

==Backstory==
<video type="youtube" id="hQKro8WEZ3I" width="480" height="360" desc="In the beginning, she put a Glock in your mouth and made a brain slushie." frame="true" position="center"/>
<br />

[[4chan]] originally got [[e-penis|interested]] when a [[btard|/b/tard]] put down the [[bong]] for a few moments and stumbled across the video, starting off yet another "[[You_laugh_you_lose|you rage, you lose]]" cancer thread causing it to quickly [[herpes|go viral]]. While most agree that [[B|/b/]] is [[not your personal army|not anyone's personal army]], much like when [[Kenny_Glenn_The_Animal_Abuser|someone hits a cat]], they joined together and immediately flooded the comments with [[RAGE]] and [[h√¶t]]. The resulting [[shitstorm]] gave birth to the [[lulzcow]] that is Jessi Slaughter.

The typical pattern of birthing this lulzcow has progressed since [[last Thursday]]. [[Anon]] trolled several of her accounts and through the use of [[Google|extensive investigative journalism]] her [[dox]] were discovered and shared.

==And So It Begins==
[[File:JessiFuckOffAnon.png|thumb|left|Moralfags complain.]]
Originally, the video was posted to [[Tumblr]] by two [[straight edge]] girls with gaping holes in their ears, named '''Autopsical''' and [http://enslavedicantbesaved.tumblr.com '''Caged Owl''']. It was [[spammed]] thousands of times to other Tumblr users, which inspired our muse to respond with a heavy amount of [[GOTIS]] using her [[ugly|whorish good looks]]. The [[2|power of Tumblr and /b/]] led to the rampant [[Pedophile|sexual obsession]]). In turn, Jessi went into full [[defense]] mode, using her [[derp|formidable wit]] to deploy sharp [[No U|"comebacks"]] in an attempt to look [[1337|super cool and awesome]], while of course [[fail]]ing miserably.

[[Aspierations|Since getting on YouTube and making threats was so effective at dissuading trolls from harrassing her]], the [[attack]] didn't end. Anonymous' talented [[Internet Detectives]] used their [[Google|powerful skills of deduction]] to find Jessi's [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[MySpace]]. As an [[loli|eleven]]-year-old [[whore]], Jessi accepted all friend requests; even from accounts with ridiculous names, such as [[What|I.P. Freely]] and [[Pedobear]] (SRSLY), resulting in anons obtaining her [[Dox|email address and place of residence]].

With this, anons shifted into a full-out [[rAIDS|Pizza-and-UPS-box-attack]] on the hapless target and numerous [[Niggers|Craigslist whores]] in the area were recruited to pay her a visit. Finally, [[moralfag]]s started their usual [[BAWWWWW|screaming]] of unfair play, finally bringing an end to the raid's momentum, much to the detriment of everyone's collective lulz.

She then decided to make a [[Tumblr]] account that was subsequently deleted, in order to [[Fap|helpfully show off]] her [[Bisexual|ex-girlfriend]] from the [[Sexy|4th grade]] and claim she [[True|"haz moar titz than u!"]] while posting pictures [[:File:Braunderbikinijessislaughter.jpg|in bikinis with a pushup bra underneath]].

==You Dun Goofed==
[[Image:Consequences2.gif|thumb|center|400px]]
<br />
As if Jessi [[Asking for it|hadn't had enough]], she released two new videos of herself [[BAWWW|crying]] hysterically while her father (a distant relative of Yosemite Sam) and his [[awesome]] child-molester mustache (molestache) going completely ape shit bonkers, screaming at the computer over the [[IRL]] and [[OL]] trolling they've just endured, despite previously stating:  "You know what? You don't faze me!" while addressing her 'haters' in her first video. Throughout the new videos, Jessi cries that: "her life is ruined" and that she's "going through hell", while her father spits out instant [[Meme|classics]] such as "'''you dun goofed'''", "'''I've backtraced your emails'''" and that the "'''[[internet police|cyberpolice]] are on their way'''". The result of these actions means that "'''the consequences will never be the same'''."

[[File:Cyberpolice.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Experts in backtracology. Your consequences may vary.]]
[[Lulz]] were had by all. Despite the fact that the original thread 404'd, [[over 9000]] new threads soon followed and even a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcSmaobYxec musical mixing] of Mel C with her dad and his consequences was spawned. In an attempt to stop the [[Internet hate machine|hate]], she deleted her [[MySpace]] account.

Much of /b/ already hopes for Jessi to be their next [[An Hero]], but that is unlikely since she was soon seen back on [[Stickam]], smiling, whoring and telling everyone shes 'fine'. How and why her parents didn't set fire to her computer right then and there will forever be one of life's mysteries and probably a better question for the [[Cops|Child Services]] to [[internets|waste time on]].

==Internets Reaction==
Within a day or so, [[Gawker|The Daily Anti-Lulz]] ran an [http://gawker.com/5589103/how-the-internet-beat-up-an-11+year+old-girl article on their blog]. Surprisingly enough, they wrote a fairly balanced and non-hysterical story on the subject, although it is filled with lulzy quotes throughout, such as:

<center>{{morphquote|jessi1|background-color: transparent; width: 70%; height: 200px;|font-weight: bold;
|Normally, we find fears about kids on the Internet the product of technophobic hysteria. But this case is a very good argument for why parents should at least be vaguely aware of what their kids are up to on the Internet. Is your [[Jailbait|11 year-old girl]] embroiled in an underage sex scandal with the lead singer of a popular emo band? Is she threatening to shoot people on YouTube videos? Maybe now is the time to invest in [[dog curtains|good parental control software]] before [[INAM|she becomes a meme]].|Sounds like fairly solid advice.
|/b/ and the chans are nature's response to making kids wear bike helmets and seatbelts; how else can the universe weed out the retards?|[[Fag|logruszed]] (thanks?)
|Unfortunately for everyone involved, someone posted it to the Internet's scariest hive mind: 4Chan.org's /b/ board and Tumblr.|Scary indeed.
|I have a theory that 4Chan is just the Storm Botnet gone sentient. If that is indeed the case, [[awesome|the world is about to be enslaved by the equivalent of an omnipresent 15 year old with entitlement issues]] and a firm belief that indifferently co-opting culture is the same as ironic reflection.|Fantasticos_Ganymede, being as pretentious as humanly possible while discussing a camwhore
|This is what 11-year-olds are like??? And I just bought my niece of the same age a Playmobil boat for her birthday? I feel such a fool|bawhide (yes and yes)}}</center>

Despite the fact that the Gawker article itself is relatively objective, the comments section of the article is an absolute goldmine of trollable [[liberals]]. Unfortunately, one needs to 'audition' and be approved for commenting like it's a fucking orchestra, and any hint of attempted lulzmaking or trolling will lead to an almost-instant [[banhammer]]. Nevertheless, it's worth seeing how the pretentious [[NORP]]s react to something [[no friends|Internet nerds]] see often. Most are absolutely shocked that an underage girl would be stripping on the [[camwhore|Internet]] voluntarily without realizing that her semi-nudity is barely the biggest issue. Fact is, if she had just gotten [[tits|naked]] and kept her stupid trap shut, she'd likely be beloved by the same people who want to make her [[an hero|disappear forever]] right now.  

Beyond Gawker, /b/ has still been on a seemingly nonstop '''Jessi Slaughter''' post-fest, with a related thread [[cancer|polluting]] the front page on nearly every refresh. Most anons are asking for [[noodz]] while the rest are either looking to cause more grief to her and her family or be [[moralfag]]s by talking about how she's just a [[loli|little girl]] and should be [[Chris_Crocker|left alone]].

Failblog posted the reaction video under the title [http://failblog.org/2010/07/16/epic-fail-video-understanding-of-the-internet-fail-2 "Understanding of the Internet Fail"]. The comments section exploded with [[moralfag]]s and [[white knights]] [[BAWW|whining that it wasn't funny]] to make fun of a spoiled brat or her [[redneck|technologically impotent daddy]]. Members of 4chan came quickly to get a little attention by trolling the NORP commenters.

On July 19th, Urlesque [http://www.urlesque.com/2010/07/19/jessi-slaughter/ picked up on the story as well]. While the article does make one-dimensional [[lie|"oh no, they shouldn't have harassed her"]] statements to appease the [[NORP]]s and [[soccer moms]] who frequent the site, the article in effect states that she was [[asking for it]].

{{quote|Decrying the trolls is sort of like decrying a gang of thugs who mugged a guy wandering dark alleys wearing a suit made of hundred dollar bills. The girl was [[camwhore|posting suggestive photos of herself]], [[internet tough guy|threatening people who posted nasty comments about her videos]] and [[idiot|taunting her bullies]]. In other words, this girl was [[asking for it|inviting it]].|Couldn't have said it any better.}}

{{Main|Adrian Chen}}

'''Some Troll's Facebook message to the mother (was emailed to me by my friend Anonymous)'''

"Your daughter:
Distributed nude photographs of herself.
Went on a live cam chat and performed all sorts of sexual behaviors.
Made threatening youtube videos towards people she didn't like/who disagreed with her/said mean things about her

The "brain slushy" video was of her talking about putting a gun in someones mouth and pulling the trigger.

Personally, I blame you and your obviously meth-addicted husband, and was 100% involved with the actions taken against your daughter.
This wasn't cyber-bullying, this was a group of proactive individuals trying to smack a little sense into a kid who's quite obviously getting zero discipline from you and your meth addicted husband.

This is not a threat.

This is a fair warning.

If Jessi does not have her internet access revoked, by you.  Then I will be forced to compile as much evidence against you and your husband as necessary and will be contacting child protective services to the effect of having your daughter removed from your household.

Responsibility should not fall on anyone's shoulders besides your own.
I am not responsible for what happen to your family, nor is anyone else who was involved in the actions taken against you.

You are responsible.

I do not want to see your daughter anywhere on the internet for the next 4 years.  I do not want to open my favorite image board sites or photobucket and stumble across disgusting photos of your daughter.

You are responsible for your child's well being.

You failed to maintain said well-being.  

And...
Now...
You've suffered the consequences.

And they'll never...
ever...
be the same."

==Police Protection?==
[[Image:Jessie_Slaughter_Nutshell.png|thumb|The whole ordeal in a nutshell.]]
[http://gawker.com/5590166/11+year+old-viral-video-star-placed-under-police-protection-after-death-threats Gawker continued its Jessi Slaughter coverage] with a story on her alleged [[dog curtains|need for police protection]]. According to Gawker's sources, Jessi and her family have been receiving death threats, resulting in Jessi's being taken into [[Jail|police custody and placed in a safe house]] for a short period of time.  Apparently, a [[judge]] also took the necessary action by banning Jessi from the Internet; something that any parent who isn't on a 24-hour-a-day [[meth]]- and [[Alcohol|Jack Daniels]]-fueled stupor would already have done. Unfortunately for Jessi (and the entire world), the order only lasted 3 days, at which point even more [[faggotry]] can be expected to emanate from the bowels of Dunnellon, Florida. 

Gawker conducted a brief phone interview with the parents, who opened their mouths and subsequently eliminated all doubt about their mental state. When her [[mother]] was asked about the "brain slushie" video, her response was: "I haven't seen it... I don't even go on the computer."

As the interview continued, Jessi's parents claimed that they were [[lie|"under 24/7 police surveillance"]], with the father further expressing that he just [[BP|"wants his life back"]] and his [[Prostitute|"daughter's life back"]]. If there's one thing that the interview made clear, it's that Jessi's parents are completely oblivious to the irony that the choices their out-of-control daughter's made are directly responsible for the absolute [[clusterfuck|shitshow]] their world has become. Jessi's father admitted that Child Protective Services became involved, which is also "something they never wanted".

===Hyperbole===
{{quote|There have been no death threats or threats of harm in any way [towards Jessi or her family]|An update according to the Florida Sheriff's department.}}

The update goes on to say that they are only investigating the possibility of pornographic pictures of her online, as well as a few prank calls that referenced them, [[implying]] that the family may have been exaggerating the situation a bit. If you left a mean comment the cyber police will find you!
