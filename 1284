'''Caffeine''' is a [[drug]] for the kids who can't get [[coke]] because they don't have any rich friends. Frequent users of caffeine include [[gamers]] who use it to stay up all night at [[Circle jerk|LAN parties]]. There are also a number of [[13 year old boy|middle school kids]] who think that they can get [[cool|high]] by taking a large number of Caffeine pills; which you can, but not without dying a slow and hilarious [[death]]. All it takes is about the equivalent of 95 cups of coffee (or about 36 No-Doz or Vivarin pills)(or 256 cans of mountain dew in under 5 minutes) in four hours to hit that mark. Unfortunately, the hallucinogenic margin is very small, and even a tiny bit too much can result in coma and death (however, you CAN get hallucinations if you stay awake long enough. It's different for every person, but usually after three days you start to hear/see funny things.) Make sure to sell some to a group of kids at the park for [[lulz]]. Since it is also an ingredient in soda, coffee, tea and energy drinks, roughly half the world is addicted to it (the rest are [[religious]] fundamentalists or too poor to afford even bargain-basement coffee grounds). All caffeine-junkies are fairly annoying, shaky people who talk [[shit]]. 

==Energy Drinks==

Energy drinks are beverages that you see being purchased in stores by [[fat]] people, [[scene]] fags, [[emo]] fags and [[Dragonforce]] fags, [[You|fag]]. Primarily designed by to be used as part of a ‘healthy diet’, people looking for a quick pick me up can be seen reading the back of the bottles and cans, seeing how much ‘[[Ripper|hardcore]]’ caffeine, riboflavin, guarana and taurine is contained in them. Obviously the most they experience is no different then drinking a few cups of coffee. Fat people (100% of internet users) gain nothing but profuse sweating from drinking them because they already have too much energy to burn off anyway. Enjoy your [[diabeetus]]. Btw, [[Truth|they all taste like Red Bull]].   

===Energy Shots===
If drinking a can full of liquid shit isn’t quite up your street and are looking for something even [[moar]] hardcore, then look no further than energy shots. Often sold in [[Pussy|50ml bottles]], they are supposedly meant to work better than energy drinks, except they taste like a mixture of mercury and piss. Anyone dumb enough to [[Blowjob|blow]] their [[Cock|money]] on them and expect anything more than just a few heart palpitations is retarded. 

==Addiction==

Caffeine addiction is a [[bullshit|serious]] ailment afflicting [[over 9000|millions]] of users worldwide, resulting in a global economic loss of nearly 1 billion [[rape dollars|dollars]].  If you believe that you or someone you know has an addiction, please [[do it faggot|call]] an [[phone sex|addiction hotline]] right away.  Caffeine addiction is a [[lie|serious disease]], and users need your help.  Some signs of serious addiction include:<br>
