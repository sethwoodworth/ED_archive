'''4girls''' is a softcore porn website published by [[NAMBLA|USDHHS]] [[feminists]] featuring "[[16-year-old girl|girls (ages 10-16)]]".  Although it claims to deal with health topics, it smacks of a thinly-veiled effort to talk about [[rape]], [[asking for it]], having [[boobs]], and other sins which 4girls will not admit, are all your fault and are all [[You_are_doing_it_wrong|wrong]], btw...

== Asking For It ==
According to 4girls, the following activities DO count as sex.

* [[Circle jerk|Mutual Masturbation]]
* [[Oral Sex]]
* [[Anal Sex]]
* Just put it in half-way
* Just put it in for a second
* [[Abortion|Pulling out]]
* [[Dildo]] play

So [[WTF]] are you waiting for!  Do it already!

"Dating a guy two to six years older than you is not a good idea!"  4girls encourages you to check for at least a 7-year age difference.

== Boobs ==

{{quote|"Having breasts is such a new thing for teen girls."|[http://4girls.gov/body/changes_breasts.htm 4girls], It's the latest trend!}}
As it's incredibly easy to lie to a teenage girl overflowing with hormones, the writers decided to flood the entire site with '''lies and girly sex propaganda and other shit''' such as:
* Exercises, vitamins, herbal teas and [[cum|creams]], will NOT change the size of one or both of your breasts.
* Bras can be very uncomfortable for some girls. Some decide to go braless. THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA! If your breasts are large enough, they can have the ability to tear your shirt if it's very tight. And if you're not wearing a bra the day this happens to YOU, then everyone will see your breasts!
* Your breasts don't need to be the same as the ones you see in magazines
* You can get pregnant the first time you have sex

== Rape & Other Bullshit ==

{{quote|"[[Rape]] is not about [[sex]]."|[http://4girls.gov/safety/daterape.htm 4girls], a.k.a. The United States Federal Government}}

{{quote|"Drinking alcohol…it's what everyone does on the weekends."|[http://4girls.gov/substance/alcohol.htm 4girls], Because everyone else is doing it.}}

{{quote|"Rape is sex you don’t agree to, including forcing a body part or object into your vagina, rectum (bottom), or mouth."|[http://www.girlshealth.gov/safety/saferelationships/daterape.cfm 4girls], Because if someone forces a finger into your mouth, it's considered rape.}}

*Drinking also raises the risk of getting [[almost raped|sexually assaulted]]?
*More females hurt themselves than males?
*[[Self-injury]] can be dangerous

== Self-Esteem ==
