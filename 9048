* Breast ironing is a form of breast reduction in which a pubescent girl's breasts are flattened with a heated object, usually by the girl's mother, in an attempt to make her less sexually attractive to men. The practice is mostly practiced in parts of Cameroon and is believed to help prevent rape and early marriage. In Cameroon, heavy tools such as grinding stones, hammers, pestles, spatulas, or other objects (eg bananas and coconut shells) are heated[1][2] and used to press or beat down the forming breasts.

* An extraocular implant (also known as eyeball jewelry) is a cosmetic implant involving a tiny piece of decorative jewelry '''which is implanted within the superficial, interpalpebral conjunctiva of the human eye.'''

* Unlike subdermal implants and other new body modification procedures, the extraocular implant is currently only being performed in a medical clinic environment. The procedure is relatively quick, but it does require that both eyes be immobilized with anesthetic drops, and that '''the layers of the eyeball where the implant is situated must be separated by the injection of liquid.''' As very few people have undergone this procedure, and it is relatively new, the long term health effects are currently unknown.

'''Healing'''

''The common practice on healing a scarification wound is use of irritation.''

* Irritation
Generally, the longer for a wound to heal, the more pronounced the scar will be. Thus, in order to have pronounced scars, the wound may be kept open for a protracted time. '''This is by abrading scabs and irritating the wound with chemical or natural irritants such as toothpaste or citrus juice.''' Some practitioners use tincture of iodine which has been proven to cause more visible scarring (this is why it's no longer used for treating minor wounds). With this method, a wound may take months to heal.

'''Cutting'''

''Cutting of the skin for cosmetic purposes is not to be confused with self-injury, which is also referred to by the euphemism "cutting." There may be cases of self-injury and self-scarification for non-cosmetic reasons. Lines are cut with surgical blades. Techniques include:''

* Packing
This method is uncommon in the West, but has traditionally been used in Africa. A cut is made diagonally and an inert material such as clay or ash is packed into the wound; massive keloids are formed during healing as the wound pushes out the substance that had been inserted into the wound. Cigar ash is used in the United States for more raised and purple scars; '''people may also use ashes of deceased persons.'''

* Abrasion
Scars can be formed by removing layers of skin through abrasion. This can be achieved using an inkless tattooing device, or any object that can remove skin through friction '''(such as sandpaper).'''

* According to George Orwell, coal miners could develop characteristic tattoos owing to coal dust getting into wounds. This can also occur with substances like gunpowder. Similarly, a traumatic tattoo occurs when a substance such as asphalt is rubbed into a wound as the result of some kind of accident or trauma. These are particularly difficult to remove as they tend to be spread across several different layers of skin, and scarring or permanent discoloration is almost unavoidable depending on the location. In addition, tattooing of the gingiva from implantation of amalgam particles during dental filling placement and removal is possible and not uncommon. A common example of such accidental tattoos is the result of a deliberate or accidental stabbing with a pencil or pen, leaving graphite or ink beneath the skin.

* While tattoos are considered permanent, it is sometimes possible to remove them with laser treatments, fully or partially. Typically, black and darker colored inks can be removed more completely. An ink trademarked as InfinitInk is designed to be removed in a single laser treatment. The expense and pain of removing tattoos will typically be greater than the expense and pain of applying them. Some jurisdictions will pay for the voluntary removal of gang tattoos. Pre-laser tattoo removal methods include dermabrasion, '''salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with salt)''', cryosurgery, and excision which is sometimes still used along with skin grafts for larger tattoos.

[[Image:Towgreatesthitsjewtat.jpg|thumb|Modern day Nazis now write their telephone numbers on bathroom walls, but  historically this wasn't the case.]]
* A practice was established to tattoo the inmate identification numbers. Initially, in Auschwitz, the camp numbers were sewn on the clothes. With the increased death rate it became difficult to identify corpses, since clothes were removed from corpses. Therefore the medical personnel started to write the numbers on the corpses' chests with indelible ink. Difficulties increased in 1941 when Soviet POWs came in masses, and the first few thousand tattoos were applied to them. This was done with a special stamp with the numbers to be tattooed composed of needles. The tattoo was applied to the upper left part of the breast. In March 1942, the same method was used in Birkenau.

* Metal stamps turned out to be impractical, and later numbers were tattoed with a single needle on the left forearm.

* The tattoo was the prisoner's camp number, sometimes with a special symbol added: some Jews had a triangle, and Roma had the letter "Z" (from German Zigeuner for "Gypsy"). In May 1944 the Jews received the letters "A" or "B" to indicate particular series of numbers.

* The teardrop tattoo or tear tattoo is a symbolic tattoo that is placed underneath the eye. The tattoo has several connotations. Teardrop tattoos usually signify the loss of a friend or loved one. An empty tear signifies that the loved one has been killed or that the bearer has unsuccessfully attempted murder. A filled tattoo signifies that a loved one has taken his or her own life, or was killed by a cause other than murder (car crash, death penalty, etc.) A tear with an empty top and a full bottom means that the wearer has avenged the murder of a loved one. The majority of the 'tear tattoos' seen in popular culture today, however, signifies that the wearer has killed, with the number of tears representing the number of kills.

* Tear tattoos, when given in prison, primarily to indicate that the bearer has murdered someone, either in or out of jail. The tattoo can also be given to commemorate a loved one who died while the wearer was incarcerated.

* In Australian prisons, teardrop tattoos are often '''forcibly given to convicted child molesters by other inmates.'''

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_makeup Permanent makeup]==

* Permanent makeup dates back at least to the start of the 20th century, though its nature was often concealed in its early days. The tattooist George Burchett, a major developer of the technique when it become fashionable in the 1930s, described in his memoirs how '''beauty salons tattooed many women without their knowledge,''' offering it as a "complexion treatment ... of injecting vegetable dyes under the top layer of the skin."

--EDiot's note, it is rather curious and odd that the Circumsision pages and their containing information cannot be found within the Body Modification portal at Wikipedia.

* The World Health Organization (WHO; 2007), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS; 2007), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; 2008) state that evidence indicates male circumcision significantly reduces the risk of HIV acquisition by men during penile-vaginal sex, but also state that circumcision only provides minimal protection and should not replace other interventions to prevent transmission of HIV.

* Infant circumcision was taken up in the United States, Australia and the English-speaking parts of Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and to a lesser extent in the United Kingdom. There are several hypotheses to explain why infant circumcision was accepted in the United States about the year 1900. The germ theory of disease elicited an image of the human body as a conveyance for many dangerous germs, making the public "germ phobic" and suspicious of dirt and bodily secretions. '''The penis became "dirty" by association with its function,''' and from this premise circumcision was seen as preventative medicine to be practiced universally.

* In the view of many practitioners at the time, circumcision was a method of treating and preventing masturbation.

* '''Adult circumcisions''' are often performed without clamps and require 4 to 6 weeks of abstinence from masturbation or intercourse after the operation to allow the wound to heal.

* In parts of Africa, the foreskin may be dipped in brandy and eaten by the patient, eaten by the circumciser, or fed to animals.

* '''Although deaths have been reported,'''the American Academy of Family Physicians states that death is rare, and cites an estimated death rate of '''1 infant in 500,000''' from circumcision.[ Gairdner's 1949 study reported that an average of '''16 children per year out of about 90,000 died following circumcision''' in the UK. He found that most deaths had occurred suddenly under anesthesia and could not be explained further, but hemorrhage and infection had also proven fatal. Deaths attributed to phimosis and circumcision were grouped together, but Gairdner argued that such deaths were probably due to the circumcision operation. '''The penis is thought to be lost in 1 in 1,000,000 circumcisions.'''

[[Image:Towgreatesthitsgomco.jpg|thumb|A 22 year old sane man using a Gomco clamp to remove the head of his penis.]]
The technique is as follows:

* Anesthetic should be applied (though it is a historically recent addition, dating only to approximately the early 1990s).

* The foreskin is separated from the glans. To do this, a dorsal slit in the foreskin is frequently employed.

* The bell of the Gomco clamp is placed over the glans, and the foreskin is pulled over the bell.

* The base of the Gomco clamp is placed over the bell, and the Gomco clamp's arm is fitted.

* After the surgeon confirms correct fitting and placement (and the amount of foreskin to be excised), the nut on the Gomco clamp is tightened, causing the clamping of nerves and blood flow to the foreskin.

* The Gomco clamp is left in place for about five minutes to allow clotting to occur, then the foreskin is severed using a scalpel.

* The Gomco's base and bell are then removed, allowing for bandaging of the penis.

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginoplasty Vaginoplasty]==

* Non-reconstructive vaginoplasty or "vaginal rejuvenation" is used to restore vaginal tone and appearance, largely by removing excess tissue and tightening supportive structures. The popularity of surgery to change the cosmetic appearance of a female's genitalia has increased in North America over the last few years. The term "designer vagina" refers to an idealized image of female sex organs attained through vaginoplasty. In recent years laser has been introduced to assist in the procedure. The rejuvenation procedure is intended to reduce or undo effects of age and childbearing.

'''--EDiot's note, make no mistake, the section on Vaginoplasty is purposely left right next to the section on Female genital cutting.'''

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_cutting Female genital cutting]==

* The WHO defines Type III FGM as narrowing of the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting and repositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation)." It is the most extensive form of FGM, and accounts for about 10% of all FGM procedures described from Africa. Infibulation is also known as "pharaonic circumcision.

* There are other forms of FGM, collectively referred to as Type IV, that may not involve tissue removal. The WHO defines Type IV FGM as "all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example, pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization." This includes a diverse range of practices, such as pricking the clitoris with needles.

'''--EDiot's note, In America, they call it "vaginoplasty" and the procedures cost several thousands of dollars.  In Africa, it's free!'''
