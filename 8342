The Young Ones
[[Image:Youngones 203.jpg|thumb|The Faces of Meth]]

The Young Ones was an [[lie|awesome]] [[British]] comedy show in the [[1980s]] about four [[college]] university students who never go to class (just like [[American]] college students) and have [[buttsecks|surreal adventures in their house]] (which American college students don't). [[bullshit|The show was actually very good, and was somehow able to pull off madcap absurdism and non-sequitors]]. This can be attributed to it being [[Australia|British]] and made during a time when everyone was coked up and had really big hair, so basically anything from then is [[retard|funny]].

== Characters ==
*'''[[Rick Astley|Rick]]''' - Idiot wannabe [[anarchist]] who thinks he's the [[goatse|hero]] of his generation and thinks [[mrpreg|anarchy]] and [[communism]] are the same thing. So basicly he's the precurser to every modern-day [[liberal]] [[fucktard|teenager]]  who think listening to Green Day and shopping at [[Hot Topic]] are really helping politics. Except there was no Green Day back then, so he listened to some fag named [[cockmongler|Cliff Richard]].
*'''Vyvyan''' - In what is probably a message to so-called modern "[[furry|punk]]s" everywhere, this ''fictional'' character is [[boxxy|probably the only real punk EVAR]]. No, not like the [[pretty cool guy|posers]] of today, punk back then was loud, violent, and [[gay|awesome]], and Vyvyan [[I came|embodied]] it. He [[raep|beat]] everyone's ass, [[tubgirl|blew shit up]], [[virgin|hated everything]] and didn't even care when he got his fucking [[tranny|head knocked off]] on a train... he was an all-around true [[furfag|antisocial]]
*'''Neil''' - [[Emo]] [[hippy]] who spends every episode trying to [[suicide|become]] [[an hero]].
*'''Mike''' - The "[[Kevin Jonas]]" of the group. Wannabe [[wigger|mack daddy playa]]. Thinks he's cool, but is a [[virgin]] just like the others. Also very short.
*'''Mr Balowski (and fucking every other Alexi Sayle character)''' - A [[Jewish]], [[Commie]] [[fat]] bastard who appears in every episode and rants for a few minutes. Essentially, a lardier but less moaning [[shit nobody cares about|Ben Elton]].
*'''Special Patrol Group''' - Glaswegian [[Hamster]] who is just like Vyvyan. In other words, he's a reverse [[furry]]. It's basically [[Divide_by_zero|dividing by zero]], only with [[fail|win]] involved.

== An hero ==
Rick and Neil have attempted to become an hero on several occasions. Various methods include:
* Home-made gallows that plays [[faggotry|'Rock Around the Clock']]
* Digging a grave but [[in the ass|getting bored]]
* [[Heath Ledger|ODing on laxatives]]
* Sticking their head in [[goatse|the oven]]
* [[furry|Pretending]] to be thermal insulation
* Self-crucifixion 
* Repeatedly smacking himself in the head with a [[longcat|cricket bat]]
* [[tl;dr|And many many more]]

Vyvyan appeared to try to become an hero on several occasions, but was actually being a hardxcore [[fursona|punk]] when he stuck his head out of a moving train window and survived, and tried to cause a [[W|nuculear]] [[holocaust]] by attacking an atom bomb.

== The fangirls [[jizztini|ruin it]] ==
[[Image:The Young Ones shounen ai.jpg|thumb|HAWT]]
Unfortunatly, in the age of DVD, it's fallen in the hands of [[16 year old girls]], who believe that since the entire main cast has a [[cock]], they must all have shitty [[slash]] fanfiction written about them. 
[[unwarranted self-importance|Now, I myself am pretty much immune to any and all horrors of the internet]], so basicly horribly-written slash about ugly British guys [[fag|doesn't bug me]].

== Bad News ==
Bad News was essentially the Young Ones [[shit nobody cares about|without Mike]] and in a spoof rock band. Might sound familiar, but [[lie|they did it a year before anyone had ever heard the words 'Spinal Tap']]. They wrecked hotel rooms, they beat up the [[cock|cameramen]], they [[fml|drank too much]], they [[meth|smoked the ganja]]. They were a shit band and were [[Anal Cunt|intended to be a shit band]].

== Bottom ==
You can't keep [[furfaggotry|lulzy]] shit down. After the Young Ones (it [[cum|finished]] when they drove a bus over a cliff) came Bottom in which Rik and Vyvyan, now called [[dick|Richard]] [[dick|Richard]] and [[Godwin's Law|Edward Elizabeth Hitler]], share a [[flatchan|flat]]. It's a fangirl's [[fact|dream]].
