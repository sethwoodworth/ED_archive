The Cordoba House, better known as the '''Ground Zero Mosque''' and the Terrorists' Cathedral, is a proposed holy sanctuary dedicated to trolling those still suffering from Post-[[9/11]] Traumatic Disorder.

In 2010, the proposal generated epic rabble-rousing, shit-stirring and all-round encouragization of racial hatred by right-wing commentators. Anti-mosque [[conservatives]] say that pro-mosque [[liberals]] are being [[Fuck you|insensitive]], pro-mosque liberals are saying that anti-mosque conservatives are being [[Racist|intolerant]], and [[Muslims]] are merely enjoying themselves as [[Americans|the great Satan]] tears itself apart.

And those who actually live around there and/or frequent the adjacent [[strippers|strip club]], '''New York Dolls''' are saying that there's already a Moslem prayer centre (aka a mosque) there -exactly where it's been since long before 9/11. [[Ironically]], the World Trade Centre itself had several dedicated Moslem prayer rooms [[spies|right inside the Twin Towers]].

Amidst the arguing, [[politician]]-turned-[[Fox News|media host]] [[Sarah Palin]] decided to speak out against the proposed [[Church|house of God]] in order to win [[Tea Party]] votes for [[2012]]. Although she never governed within the continental U.S., Palin is now leading the crusade for those who wish for Ground Zero to always be a useless sandpit and an eyesore in the middle of the city. 

[[Meanwhile]], [[Democrat]]-turned-[[Republican]]-turned-[[liberal]] [[confused|Independent]] [[NYC|Mike Bloomberg]], after getting rid of term limits in order to rule as long as he likes, is backing the mosque proposal in order to appears as New York's [[Führer|benevolent dictator]] and overall good guy.

{{squote|The individuals who hijacked two airplanes and flew them into the World Trade Center towers shouted, “[[Allahu Akbar|Allahu Akhbar]]”. The individuals who will attend the mosque would offer up like praise of “Allahu Akhbar”. The individuals who detonate suicide vests, behead school teachers and headmasters, throw acid on little girls trying to attend school, and fire rockets into Israel shout, “Allahu Akhbar”.|Allen West}}

[[Ironically]], the stated purpose of the Cordoba Initiative is to [[Lie|"improve Muslim-West relations"]].

==Those Numbers Again==

===Fun Facts About The Ground Zero Mosque===
# It's not at Ground Zero! The building that is due to be renovated is two city blocks away from Ground Zero. 
# It's not just a mosque! It will include the traditional [[pedo]] room and balcony for [[Allah]]'s trolls to laugh at the infidels.
# The guy in charge of the project, Imam Faisal Abdul Rauf, is an [[Liar|anti-terrorist, pro-west progressive]] - exactly the kind of "[[oxymoron|Good Moslem]]" that most left-wing hippies have wet dreams about!
# Prior to 9/11, there were already two mosques standing adjacent to Ground Zero. The proposed project doesn't even have a view of the former location of the Twin Towers.

===What Has Emerged From The Project===
# The loudest, most visible elements of American politics - and those claiming to be the MOST GOSH DERN AMERICAN - have painted Americans as being hateful and anti-Islamic with a delicious bombable center like never before.
# [[Lolwut|Everyday non-psychotic Moslems]] (both of them) who just want to sell us cheap liquor and samosas feel increasingly marginalized and at risk. 
# One of the most important teachers of Moslem [[holocaust|tolerance]] and [[Fascism|progressivism]] is painted by the right-wing media as a supporter of Hamas and thrown to the wolves, demonstrating to Moslems everywhere that no matter how much you grovel to the white man, [[GTFO|you're not welcome here, boy]].
# Retarded [[Americunt]]s have not realized there are no provisions in the Constitution or Bill of Rights for their hurt feelings.

==From Ghetto to Landmark==
{{squote|A potential landmark must be at least thirty years old and must possess 'A special character or special historical or aesthetic interest or value as part of the development, heritage, or cultural characteristics of the city, state, or nation.'|[http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/html/faqs/faq_designation.shtml Does this say "Burlington Coat Factory" to you?]}}

At the moment, the site on which the community center is planned to be built on is the dilapidated remnants of a Burlington Coat Factory building. This former coat factory is taking up space and not helping the economy in any way except for encouraging a healthy trade in urine and meth between homeless squatters. 

Opponents of the mosque are presently [[Lolwut|trying to turn this useless concrete shell into a landmark]]. [[Nothing of value]] occurred at the site, yet opponents of the proposed community center claim that the coat factory deserves [[New York]] landmark status. Equally ironically, the whole area was a bulwark of Moslem settlers a century before the damn coats were even there.

==Greg Gutfeld's Islamic-Friendly Gay Bar==
In an attempt to bridge [[Goatse|the gap]] between the [[Muslims]] and the [[gay]] communities, Greg Gutfeld, host of ''Red Eye'', is [[Divide by zero|opening a Muslim-friendly gay bar]]. This is an attempt to show a "sincere desire for dialogue, [[Trolling|the bar will be situated next to the mosque Park51]], in an available commercial space," despite the fact that he is not [[Muslim]] or [[gay]]. Before the show was over, the hashtag #gutfeldgaybarnames was circulating on twitter, go checkout all the names for your self.

==$5 million in Federal 9/11 relief grant money to go to mosque==
In November 2010, it was learned that the mosque applied for $5 million in federal grant from a fund designed to rebuild lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks.  "Part of the strangeness of the application is that it blows past the suggested range of $100,000 to $1 million that these grants are supposed to fall to within."

==The Biggest Irony Of All...==

[[File:Cordoba_supports_jews.jpg|thumb|right|...and Cordoba is pro-Israel. Coincidence??!??!?]]

...is that [[Jews did 9/11]].
