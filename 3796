'''Hugo Chavez''' is the President of [[Venezuela]], hero and famous [[IRL]] [[Troll]]. He was elected president of Venezuela forever since 1998 and on. According to [[Conservapedia]] he's a repressive dictator, so you can [[ignore]] this statement. 

Also, he's a a suspected member of the [[Ultraviolet News Network]]. He actually drinks two dozen cups of coffee a day and [http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2008/01/chavez-admits-c.html has a bad cocaine habit]given by Evo Morales in exchange of the oil, medical resources that he gifts to Bolivia.


== Early years ==

[[Image:El Dorado.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Chavez in his youth.]]

Chavez was born in [[Florida]] to Josefina Chavez and [[Fundamentalist|Samuel Prescott Bush]]. Samuel Bush was a railroad executive and an [[asswipe]] who never acknowledged responsibility for lil Hugo's birth. So Chavez had to flee the country since his older brother [[Baptist|Prescott Bush]] put a price on his head. Thus, Chavez took revenge on our [[Lie|beloved ex-president]], [[W]].

Actually, he´s butthurt because his parent were lazy fucks who didn´t do shit to earn any money, so he hated everybody with money, so his master plan is to put everybody in the same echonomic level he was when he was young: Extreme Poverty

== Relationship with Fidel Castro ==
[[Image:CastrolessthanthreeChavez.jpg|thumb|200px|"Hmmm... your chest is hard, Chavito!"]]

Chavez declared Cuban President [[Fidel Castro]] as his [[BFF]] and their relationship has been much discussed. Castro has helped Chavez build a powerful [[army]] of [[Midget|chupacabras]]. According to [[shemale|Ann Coulter]], they're two gayboys, but that frigid bitch says that about every liberal guy on this planet.

What is beyond doubt is that once Fidel is six feet under, Chavez will take over as the leading critic of the U.S., and so [[Yankees]] will never get to live in a world without [[H8|hate]] from poor, repressed banana republics.


== The Pat Robertson Controversy ==

{{Quote|I know everything about assassination, and if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it. It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war, and I don’t think any oil shipments will stop. |Pat Robertson, on ''The 69 Club''.|color=red|size=200%}}

After this statement, good [[Christian]] [[Pat Robertson]] said that he had been [[Never drinking again|drinking heavily]] and that he actually didn't mean that Chavez should be [[pwned]], just that somebody should take a M1903A4 rifle with a M84 sight and blow his head up. Upon hearing all this hullabaloo, Chavez inquired "Who's Pat Robertson?"


== Offense to Satan ==

[[Image:ChavezBat.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Where's your [[Satan]] now?.]]

The day after [[W|George W. Bush]] addressed the same session of the [[United Nations|U.N.]] General Assembly, Chavez [[troll|trolled]] with the following:

'''"The devil came here yesterday, and it smells of sulfur still today, this table that I am now standing in front of."''' 

At that point, Chavez made the sign of the cross, positioned his hands as if praying and looked briefly up to the ceiling. He continued:

'''"Yesterday, ladies and gentlemen, from this rostrum, [[idiot|teh President of the United States]], the gentleman to whom I refer as teh [[devil]], came here, talking as if he owned the world."''' 

Satan didn't like the comparison one bit. Neither did the American media, whose reactions have led [[leftards]] to declare it one of the worst examples of [[IRL trolling]] in history.

== Countertrolling ==

[[Image:ESPTFU.jpg|thumb|Juan Carlos becomes a [[meme]]]]
[[Image:Clinton-juan-carlos-lulz.jpg|thumb|Remembering good moments.]]
Chavez became the victim of a vicious IRL countertrolling at the hands of King Juan Carlos I of [[Spain]], a member of the House of [[alcohol|Bourbon]] which has been in power since [[last Thursday]]. Having a lot more experience in the [[MMORPG]] known as international diplomacy, King Juan Carlos quite rightly told Chavez to "[[STFU]] u [[noob]] [[fgt]]" at the Ibero-American summit. Some Spanish [[faggot]] then made the sound clip into a ringtone and sold it to Jamster, where it became more popular among the Spanish than [[Crazy Frog]]. But [[shit nobody cares about|nobody gives a shit]] about the Spanish.  

Chavez then was trolled by his own people when they voted not to give him perpetual [[ops]] in #Venezuela. It is suspected, however, that this is the result of a conspiracy by the [[Illuminati]] and the Jews. Chavez has been recovering from the [[butthurt]] by playing [[XBox|xbawks]] under the handle [[straight edge|xXxCaUdIlLoxXx]] while huffing [[jenkem]].
