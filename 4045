Integer

[[Image:Pi_pie.jpg|thumb|left|Not an integer, but still tasty]]The '''integers''' [[tl;dr|(from the Latin integer, which means with untouched integrity, whole, entire) are the set of numbers consisting of the natural numbers including 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)]].

'''tl;dr:''' You can use Integers to save whole numbers. Inserting a float value like 0.5 will result in 0 when stored as an integer. Rounding and floor/ceiling instances will vary. Check with your local integer provider for [[moar]] options. 

Integers can be [[over 9000]], but not bigger than 2^63. Using Integers the wrong way can result in [[lulz|bugs]] in software. Using MAX_INT can be used to fuck up bad websites.

Note: Sometimes integers can be bad. For instance, trying to round pi to three could result in not a circle, but a tightly-wound spiral.
