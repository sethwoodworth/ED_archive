'''FoolQuest.com''' is a website created by Aaron Agassi to demonstrate his insanity to the world.

The introductory page is difficult to read because, in his narcissism, Aaron covered the text with photographs of himself. If you scroll down, there is a link with a picture that says, "Click to enter," and when you put the cursor over it, it changes into a pair of tickets saying, "Admit one." Doing this takes you into what I like to call the "portal of abject insanity." There is no coherent navigational system to the site, so you stumble through this labyrinth by clicking on random words like "BABE." The modified photographs apparently have some sort of symbolic meaning to him. Also, please excuse the circa-1995 HTML technology and clip-art; he was using Microsoft FrontPage 5.0 to make it.

He also apparently took a few random pictures of naked women and used CSS to position things like animated spiders and poorly made devil's horns over the photographs.
== The man behind the [[lulz]] ==
Aaron Agassi currently believes he has a form of fucktardedness known as [[Asperger's syndrome]]. Symptoms include writing pompous tirades on the [[Internets]] and being a [[luser]].

When he discovered this article, he had this to say:

{{quote|Memetically speaking, Encyclopedia Dramatica exists not merely to catalogue and report, and in a jaundiced eye indeed, but to exacerbate drama (as per the special definition), to raise lulz and decrease logic, as from this they derive some meager joy and sad false sense of superiority. To be fair, indeed, given exactly such an attitude, it is not clear whether the somewhat juvenile Encyclopedia Dramatica even makes any claim of fairness or balance. Or whether they should be held responsible for inspiring any truly destructive hate behavior even, for example, such as distinctly malicious and damaging gossip and ostracism or in any effect helping to target bullying of any kind. But there is little sense that any precaution is taken either. As parody, Encyclopedia Dramatica might do better to be the more self effacing, not just flippant to the point of flirtation with cruelty. -Especially to guard themselves from exactly the sort of pompous hubris over which they perceive and obsess over in others. For such is exactly the risk entailed in just such ubiquitous and pervasive delusions of iconoclasm. In other words, smile when you demean me, so that I'll know that we are all friends, and that your gentle ribbing is meant inclusively.|Aaron Agassi, missing the god damn point}}
