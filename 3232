'''Garry's Mod''' is a ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' [[Modding|modification]]. It was created by [[britfag|the most brilliant British coder]] who goes by the name of Garry, who made an ugly interface on top of Valve's engine that took him 11 versions to get it right and [[lazy|left the community to do the rest]]. The primary use of Garry's Mod is to entertain creative people. Unfortunately, a majority of the community is under the age of 12 and most of the time not creative.

==Singleplayer==
Seriously, no one plays singleplayer in this except people with [[Pirate|pirated]] copies and/or people who [[You_don't_have_any_friends|don't have any friends]].

==Multiplayer==
[[Image:typicalgmodserver.jpg|thumb|Typical Gmod Multiplayer Experience.]]
Garry's Mod multiplayer is intended to let players play together and share contraptions. Instead it has become the [[Detroit]] of the Multiplayer world, because anything you make can be [[raped|removed]] by the feared [[Rape|REMOVE]] tool. Some people use prop protector to save their props, but minges will always find a way provided with enough time. Most sessions end in a war where the minge and the server's population kill each other over and over again.

But in other cases of this clusterfuck they call Garry's Mod Multiplayer, there may be no problem when someone joins a building server full of intellectual people with goals of construction. But of course any kind of harmless shenanigans (like giving Alyx balloon tits) will be frowned upon by the server-goers and the offender will be deemed not fit for the server and booted.

'''Warning: You will have exactly 2 minutes to finish up a contraption when a mingebag arrives.'''

===Ways to get kicked or banned from a server===
*Join a server.
*Spawn a jeep.
*Shoot people with the guns [[irony|''given to you by '''the game''']].
*Enter both the answer and question into console. (42 and ???)
*Throw explosive shit around, since the guns do nothing.
*Go away from the keyboard for more than two seconds.
*Walk around throwing grenades for fun, when two of them happen to hit the admin's whorehouse he was building and set it on fire.
*Go to a Noxious Net server and ask about how Jetboom harvests rcon passwords.
*Use any of Garry's Mod's features, besides walking, on an RP server.
*Tell the kid who won't stop complaining about someone throwing a prop at his ragdoll to kindly shut the fuck up.
*Be a cool, level-headed guy.
*Build something that launches shit.
*Build something original and kickass.
*Don't buy CSS. Despite being a 12-year-old wankfest, half of the shit in gmod shows up as either a gigantic red ERROR model or a black-and-purple seizure-tastic eye rape.
*Have a sense of humor.
*Have fun.
*Build something that doesn't use [http://www.wiremod.com Wire Mod].
*Ask for help on how to use things as you play Gmod for the first time.
*Ignite Dr.Breen connected to balloons.
*Pretty much anything

==DarkRP==
Most Servers that use a third party game mode are using DarkRP or some other shitty RP mod. -[[fail|RP]] allows you to pick your job and buy/sell things etc., <s>be a furry</s> that class got removed thank god, or pretend to be a member of the opposite sex in order to perform oral sex on Mayors/Cops for lulz/money. It is not as cool as it sounds, it is infact a demonic creation of Satan.[[Image:rp downtown v20033.jpg|thumb|Proof of said furry class.]]DarkRP in Garry's Mod is the next worst thing to Minges. Every DarkRP server has the same thing going on:
*People love being cops so they can ruthlessly abuse you and defilate you.
*If you can't be a cop, the next best choice is to be a Gun Dealer. Those guys pwn [[fucking everything]].
*Everyone loves going to the gun shop so they can buy a gun that they'll lose in 2 minutes, and use it to kill everyone they see in sight.
*Many people are under the impression that they are the admin of the server and tell you to get out. Unfortunately, they are all fucktarded 12 year old children.
* "[[DESU|DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU  DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU  DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU]]" is a popular responce for JOB
*[[irony|Almost no real roleplay at all.]]
* Mods who offer you the illusion of something to do other than watch people put a basket on top of a table. You will be given a physgun, but not be able to spawn props, then you will be taken away the physgun, mess around with the GG, and then be banned for a finite amount of time. If you ever complain about why the server is so boring, you will be called an RP noob and then permabanned.
* On rp_evocity_v2 there is a cave, and entering or even coming too close to it will cause the server to crash. Look at the signs carefully, and find the road to the campground. If you encounter a giant tiled wall, right click a jeep with the no collide tool and drive through it. Keep going till you reach the cave. Politely inform the players on the server that you're going to "enter the cave", then rush into it immediately, giving them no time to save anything. When the server restarts, [[do it faggot|do it again.]]
* It is a well known fact all of DarkRP servers are 10 year old kids. When treated right said 10 year olds may yield exciting results.

Other communities sometimes have loads of drama or they are full of assholes, such as HGN [[Shit Nobody Cares About|whom the leader apparently payed a hacker $150 just to steal a shitty script from another RP community.]]

'''Warning: Anyone who plays RP for more than 43 seconds will have a seizure'''. However, RP servers are the easiest to troll since it's players are mostly consisted of 12 year olds, usually resulting in epic lulz.

==Mingebags==
Mingebags are Garry's Mod's version of a [[god]]. A typical mingebag devotes his life to delivering [[lulz]] and making 12 year olds cry on Garry's Mod servers.
Here are a few ways a [[god|mingebag]] does this:
*Spawn (and ignite) huge objects until the server crashes.
*Make prop spawners of giant objects and spam them until the server crashes
*[[delete fucking everything|Delete everyone's objects]].
*Motor a table to the ground and adv dupe it, then make another table and quickly dupe one under it and one on top of it, activating both at the same time. [[Lulz]] will ensue.
*Rope everyone's objects to the ground.
*Spawn an object and cover it in propcannons that fire propane tanks, aim at ground and fire until server crashes
*Kill everyone until he gets smacked with the banhammer or [[win|everyone leaves]]
*Spawn a dumpster, flip it upside down, and cover other people's objects with it
*Constantly say something like "YOU'RE [[hacking|HACKING]] YOU FUCKING [[fag|FAGGOT]] LEAVE BEFORE THE ADMIN [[ban|BANS]] YOU", "why the FUCK was i just kicked?" or "YOU PIECE OF SHIT I'M GOING TO RIP YOUR HEAD OFF AND SHIT DOWN YOUR NECK"

Experienced [[gods|mingebags]] are to be praised for their amazing [[skill|skill]] unlike their typical [[13 year old boy]] counterpart. The underage b& Mingebags use their microphone CONSTANTLY, raping everyone's ears. They are comparable to [[skiddies]] in a raid.

===Becoming a Minge===

So you've decided to [[win|become a minge.]] Congratulations.  

As a minge, it is your sworn duty to utterly ruin the experience of GMOD for anyone and everyone you come into contact with while creating [[epic lulz]] for yourself. It seriously takes little to no effort or thought to troll other players, but if you [[derp|can't think of anything]], try one of the following:

*[[Spamming]]
*[[Trolling]]
*Changing your name to /citizen on a Roleplay server and taking cigarettes
*[[Doing it for the lulz]]
*Spawning large props and crashing a server, also overloading the LUA
*Use [[hax]] to crash servers
*Go onto a DarkRP server with the [[drug]] mod, change your name to "/citizen", take cigarettes and watch as [[copypasta|the entire server changes to the citizen job]]. Bonus points if the server usually votes "[[no]]" to job votes.
*Do the same as above, except with the name "/buymoneyprinter", and watch as everyone in the server with $1000 spawns a money printer. Unsuspecting people on the streets will buy a printer and the server will become a lulzfest over them.
*Download [http://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?tag=autoaim autoaim] and [http://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?tag=wallhack wallhack] luas from garrysmod.org and rape everyone

As [[cock|freshmeat]] to the Minge game, here are some tips.

*Always target kiddies.  They are the easiest to piss off and provide the most lulz.  Do not do this under the view of a [[moralfag]] or [[admin]].
*When in doubt, [[spam]] everything.
*Avoid servers with regular moderation.  Mods can put a stop to your schemes.  Unless you can [[delete fucking everything|hack the server's LUA]] never go toe-to-toe with mods.  The longer you stay on a server minging successfully the longer your [[e-peen]] grows.  Bonus points if an admin is on.
*Make friends with other minges.  Strength and [[lulz]] are in numbers.

==Ragdoll Posing==
Garry's mod allows you to use a special gun to pose ragdolls into different positions. The most common of them is the genre of "sex poses". Sex poses are commonly made by mingebags due to the fact that that is all that [[fucktard|fucktards]] ever think about. These sex poses are usually posed with Dr. Kleiner (an old man) and Dr. Judith Mossman (an even older woman)doing it doggie style.

==Face Posing==
Another feature Garry's Mod include is face posing. This allows you to make people have different expressions. The only problem with it is that [[fag]] Garry made it so that every face pose [[lulz|looks like the person is having an orgasm.]]

==As A Source of Creating Drama==
While one can do many fun things with Garry's Mod like your favorite [[Rule 34]] of Alyx and Barney, there are some better things you can do, such as recreations of tragic events.  For example, in a perfect example of [[too soon]], a [[totse]] member re-created the dramatic events on the day of the 7/7 2005 [[London]] bus bombings '''''mere hours after it had happened''''':

{{quote|I have to take a shower in a bit, I'd have done it earlier but my dad was about to get up to get ready. So I decided to kill some time and emulate the recent London bus explosion in some good ol' Garry's Mod 8.3b

==Expression 2==
A modification to GMOD to make script kiddies feel like they have pro 1337 scripting skills. Usually used by faggots and noobs. An average GMOD server consists of everyone jerking off while leaving their Expression 2 editor open. While many people use this to create a useless shitty base there are also over 9000 trolling possibilities.

[[Garry's_Mod/Expression_2_Scripts|Example Scripts]]

==Videos==
Every Garry's Mod video on Youtube falls into one of two categories: The first type is [[machinima]], which is pretty self-explanatory. While there are a few well-made and occasionally funny videos, most of them are [[shit]] and boil down to a montage of short skits because the creator couldn't be motivated to even attempt something coherent.

The second (and much larger) type of video is the griefing video. Like the machinima, a lot of these are hit and miss, as most of them consist of 12 year olds who think they're the most hilarious thing ever by acting randomly in the server instead of actually griefing the other players. Most of these videos are usually 10 minutes long and are simply not entertaining to watch. This makes Garry's Mod the only game where a griefer can fail just as hard at making a video as a machinina maker.
