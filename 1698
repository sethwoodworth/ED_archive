Comment whore
[[Image:Myaplayboy_kiss.jpg|thumb|A good way to increase your comments received number is to make your journal [[friends only]] and make people comment to be added.]]

A variety of [[Attention_Whore | attention whore]] who uses a message board, forum, or journaling site for the express purpose of gathering the warm fuzzies generated by the insincere well-wishes of complete strangers who probably just [[TL;DR]]'d the post in the first place and are merely posting something [[ghey]] like [[*hug*|~HUGZ!~]] or [[less than three|&lt;3]] because as their glazed eyes skimmed down to the next batch of [[quiz]] results or Evanescence lyrics, they just happened to catch the words "[[cutting]] myself" or "[[fat]]" or "welfare check".  

There are a number of classic comment whore tactics, including:

* "FIRST"  or "FRIST" or "[[First post|FIST PROST]]" or "FIRST COMMENT LOLOLOLOL"
* "I am a total fat slob" (''cries, cuts'')
* "I have an incurable [[Disease | disease]] that's more [[Leet | elite]] than yours" (''cries, cuts'')
* "Nobody likes me.  None of you are reading this anyway." (''cries, cuts'')
* "My bipolar/eating/social anxiety disorder is totally out of control.  My medication/meditation is no longer working." (''cries, cuts'')
* "I have no money and I need to buy <strike>crack</strike> [[shoes]] for my child.  Please follow my paypal link." (''cries, cuts'')
* "[[Anniesj|At 9:45 last night, the Secret Service showed up on my mother's front door to talk to me about what I said about the President]]..." (''cries, cuts'')
* "[[Rachelle Waterman|Just so you know, last night my mother was murdered]]." (''cries, cuts'')
* "[[Jameth|Here are some pictures of my cats!]]"
* Prior to the suspension of his journal, [[Fireuzer]] had devised a method involving a self-made spam script aimed at his own journal, which scored him over 200,000 comments, [http://www.livejournal.com/~marksmith Marksmith] apparently became very jealous of this and listed it as one of the reasons in his suspension.
* "Do I look like (insert latest celebrity here)?"
* "Thumbs up if you agree (with me)..." [On Youtube] 

Of course, all of these fine comment whoring tactics can be easily doubled in efficacy by merely disabling [[comments]] on the post in question, thereby obligating everyone on the planet to find the next most recent post and comment about the comment-disabled post.

[[The Anti-Disney Movement]] is a perfect example of male comment whores
