Raisa Mendoza
[[Image:RaisaMendoza1.jpg|thumb|Is this [[Alcohol]] to making me looks cool?]]

'''Raisa Mendoza''' is [[Spanish]] for [[cocktease]] and as well at least according her [[MySpace]] page an Mexican [[bitch|Bitch"]], Which is a not a breed of dog of not owned by [[Ron Mexico]] nor should it be confused with a [[your mom|collie bitch]]. Although they can be synonymous to each other. Apparently she's the only thing that's good that came out of [[Mexico|Ecuador]] other then other than the funny hats, tacos, and a stash of cocaine that would make Marion Barry run for mayor again. Due a skyrocketing amount of [[sick fuck|molesters, rape apes and Pedobears]] on myspace, Raisa's popularity has skyrocketed enough to rival [[Tila Tequila]].

==Tits or GTFO My Top 8==
Raisa joined myspace roughly 1 year ago and had one thing in mind. To become the biggest tease on [[myspace]]. But she needed help. So after speaking with Tom in his office in San Antonio about becoming the biggest tease on [[myspace]] after [[Blowjob|long hours of negotiations and compromise]]. She instantly had [[OVER 9000]] friends. To increase her popularity more rapidly she flooded her page with pictures of herself holding her boobs with the [[Asking for it|"just asking for it"]] look on her face while millions of [[13 year old boys]],[[pedophiles]], and [[rapist]]s immediately jumped on the bandwagon.

==ZOMG I'M GETTING TROLLED!==
A few months ago Raisa got into a some drama with a pair of [[16 year old girl|16 year old]] [[niggers|Nigras]] on her Saynow number (listed below) calling her "an ugly bitch", "Look like a poodle" for about a good two minutes. Raisa immediately posted a bulletin on myspace and wrote a blog ironically [[bitch]]ing about the whole situation and essentially saying [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|"I'MMA GETTING MUH LAWYERS."]] Then she realized that even if she did win she probably wouldn't get anything out of those two and they'd probably only pay her the damages with foodstamps. So like any other Mexican't she got lazy and didn't finish the job.

==I'M QUITTING THE INTERNETS==
Recently [http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=237452695&blogID=316912696 "Raisa's myspace account has been deleted or hacked for the 4th time"], which explains why this article lacks some citations and proof for the [[lulz]]. But all fingers point to [[Mike Sandy]] and his [[1337]] [[Computer Science III]] skills. However We all know that [[Gay|he loves the cock]] so much that the mere sight of a woman would scare him. So he can be ruled out as a suspect. So Raisa sent everyone on her Saynow.com mailing list a long text message stating: "This is goodbye my final goodbye I'm having a [[Mitchell Henderson|bad day, someone stole my Ipod]] This is bullshit I am not on the frontpage of saynow.com I HATE THIS SHIT I'm quitting the internets and [[an hero|quitting IRL]]"

==Oh Hai I'm back sorta..==
As of the first week of October 2007, she is currently on the front page of Saynow.com after a relentless amount of bitching to the saynow admins. And she's NOT [[an hero|AN HERO]] However, she is showing the signs of becoming one. Her cousin left a special message to all her saynow.com fans saying that Raisa is "so upset about what myspace has done to her" and "has the strength to continue on and she's not going to let no one bring her down" which means apparently people haven't been [[troll]]ing her enough.

==External Links==
If you're one of those bastards who have nothing better to do then to make someone's else life miserable feel free to troll her using these [[oh exploitable]]
