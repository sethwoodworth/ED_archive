TashkentFox
{{potential}}
'''TashkentFox''' (Real name: Edward Barlow, Age: 19) is a [[Nazi|fascist]] [[Furries|furfag]] hailing from [[Manchester]] who thinks the feeling of live mice scrabbling down his throat is super sexy. Frequently compared to [[Cigarskunk]], he is best known for his rabid and frequent right-wing [[Cry|outbursts]], resulting in epic trolling and [[lulz]] on the part of other members. His brief, but notable instances of political commentary have resulted in many gains for his [[KKK|nationalist views]].
 
[[Image:Nobody likes you.png|thumb|TashkentFox made a [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/72011-Rant-Why-does-nobody-like-me?highlight= thread] asking why nobody likes him. To his [[obvious|utter shock and dismay]], furs flocked to [[troll]] the fuck out of him before the thread was closed.]]

Tashkent began his internet activities on [[YouTube]], uploading propaganda for the [[White Nationalism|BNP]] and various other anti Communist sideshows. This brief foray into political commentary was cut short after he deleted everything in a fit of [[nerd rage|rage]] after a perceived disagreement with Nick Griffin. 

In March 2010 he decided to continue his antics on Furaffinity's [[furpile|forums]], initially doing a good job hiding his raging paranoia and rarely stirred up trouble until...

Sometime in 2010, Tashkent discovered the existence of a monument to three [[Irish]] guys who were executed for shooting a police officer [[At least 100 years ago|over 100 years ago]] a few miles from his home. Tashkent's family have a deep-seated hatred of Leprechauns, as they were thrown out of Dublin for pissing off the IRA. As a result, he felt an uncontrollable urge to make a thread about it and also stated that he smeared [[shit|dog shit]] over the monument, instantly sparking off a drama war which showed he never had any sanity. He quickly began accusing other posters of being [[terrorism|terrists]] or terrist supporters; this continued for several weeks until he earned himself [[b&|moderation]] for his idiotic trash. While on [[butthurt|moderation]], he made an alternative account under the pseudonym of '''Astana'''.  For a few days, he went unnoticed until he became engaged in a [[flame war]] with a member he had previously argued with. A passing mod noticed that Tashkent had failed to change his IP address and both his accounts were [[b&|perma-banned]].

Shortly afterward, he made another account on another site, UKfurs, a forum for [[british]] furfags. Thinking that since everybody else was there was [[James Bond|english]], everybody would [[unrealistic expectations|back him up]] in his random anti-irish [[raeg|campaign]]. Unfortunately, he failed to realize that [[shit nobody cares about|nobody gives a shit]] and listening to him is annoying as fuck. He was [[b&]] from the forums and [[cockblock|all his lulzy posts were instantly deleted]].

According to a shout made on [http://www.youtube.com/user/wolftail100 this youtube] account, Tashkent has been kicked out of his house by his mom, possibly due to his heroic protesting of bedtime by means of flinging dog shit.

Or this.
