Sarah Saga
Over in {{ljcomm|housematehorror}} some shitty LJC, an [[epic|amazing saga]] began when <s>{{ljuser|dragontigerclaw}}</s> some shitty LJC user posted about his [[delusional|experiences with a girl]] named "Sarah". Sarah is COMPLETELY [[batshit crazy|normal]] and UTTERLY [[bitch|awesome]], though [[some argue]] that she believed herself to be [[Otakukin|bonded]] with a character from a [[video game]]. [[Some argue|Some also argue]][[Jews did WTC]], so who the fuck knows.

After a few posts, [[you|people]] started to wonder if the story was [[true]] or just [[lonelygirl15|an elaborate writing project]]. In all actuality, because it involves a girl, it's most likely a [[fact|complete and utter pack of lies and/or schizophrenic delusions]].

== The Beginning ==

[[Image:TBoneSteak.jpg|thumb|Meat in the community fridge? NOOOOO!]]

The Saga begins with [http://community.livejournal.com/housematehorror/90708.html these] [http://community.livejournal.com/housematehorror/94679.html six] [http://community.livejournal.com/housematehorror/99131.html entries] [http://community.livejournal.com/housematehorror/101886.html posted] [http://community.livejournal.com/housematehorror/105501.html to] [http://community.livejournal.com/housematehorror/108953.html housematehorror]. A few of [[the best]] bits include Sarah's [[BAWWWW|whining]], though what else is new? Apparently, there was meat in a fridge somewhere, so as a [[vegetarian]] she felt the need to insist on it being thrown out. This is [[fact|completely logical]], because if [[unwarranted self-importance|one person can't handle meat, THEN NO ONE CAN]]. She also picketed some barbecue.

Sarah was also unemployed and refused to look for a job. However, she still spent a lot of money, and the others in the house wondered [[prostitute|where it was coming from]]. Some people on the [[Internets]] [[Scientology|donate money to her to spread her "religion."]] 

She also had a "Bishop" friend of hers over [[sex|on several occasions]]. This gender-confused "Bishop", known only as Something, is supposedly [[soulbonding]] Sasarai from the ''Suikoden'' games, and has a [http://holyharmonia.com/mundi/ website]. Sadly, there doesn't appear to be a place for soulbonders to fork over their parent's hard earned cash. In a [http://community.livejournal.com/housematehorror/143078.html recent development] in the Sarah Saga, Something's [[cock|soulbond]] [[rape|raped]] Sarah and was [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|sentenced to death]]. Unfortunately [[Lie|soulbonds aren't real]], so instead of [[Fail|wiping another idiot off the face of the planet Sarah probably waved her arms around and claimed the imaginary rapist was gone]]. Something is supposedly in jail now for being a con artist.

== The Story Spreads ==

A link to the stories appeared in {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1279872.html here] a couple weeks after the initial post. Though lulz did abound, several fags decided to make a fuss about it for [[faggotry|no good reason]]. A few users [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1279872.html?thread=129015936#t129015936 don't like a few parts of the story] and [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1279872.html?thread=129018240#t129018240 others find the whole thing too good to be true]. It was also brought up that {{ljuser|dragontigerclaw}} [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1279872.html?thread=129019520#t129019520 mentioned being a furry porn/hentai artist]. Meanwhile, [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1279872.html?thread=129035904#t129035904 research is conducted to find out what character this girl thinks she is].

== Reason to Disbelieve ==

The [http://community.livejournal.com/housematehorror/117961.html next part of the story] is posted using the same username, but is allegedly a different person in the house. Then [http://community.livejournal.com/housematehorror/132749.html another person from the house posts]. Some point out that the writing styles are similar. [[trolling|Are they the same person, making some sort of elaborate writing project? Who knows!]]

[http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1329084.html A post] is made in {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} informing us drama-mongers that {{ljuser|eckhartip}} has come to the defense of "Sarah" in {{ljcomm|housematehorror}}. He states that everything said is a lie, and that this "Sarah" has never had housemates! She lives alone! The post was deleted, but {{ljuser|sushimustwrite}} [http://ecrivain.zeenell.com/hhsarahwtf.html screencapped the entry]! Meanwhile, {{ljuser|sistercarrion}} [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1329084.html?thread=135580860#t135580860 finds dragontigerclaw's choice of community membership odd], which leads to more wondering if it's all just a project or [[social experiment]].

All of this comes to a temporary conclusion when the mod of {{ljcomm|housematehorror}} makes [http://community.livejournal.com/housematehorror/136211.html a post] about the whole damn situation, telling members of {{ljcomm|housematehorror}} to stop trying to guess who Sarah is.

== Conclusion? ==

[[Shit nobody cares about|At this point, not that many people seem to believe it's true]]. Over at [[Something Awful]] [http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2934835&userid=0&perpage=40&pagenumber=1 a thread] is made about the whole Sarah Saga. [http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2934835&userid=0&perpage=40&pagenumber=4#post347987361 Later in the thread] someone seems to have found out who this "Sarah" really is. She appears to not only have been "Aeris" in the "[[FF7]] House" stories, but is also one of the [[Sephirothslave|crazy chicks]] that is astral married to Sephiroth. This thread has been [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1339941.html posted] to {{ljcomm|sf_drama}}, wherein clever internet detectives have revealed her old (alleged) [http://web.archive.org/web/20041011072022/www.seiryuu.org/~raincrystal/xanadu/ website], and her (alleged) [http://raincrystal.livejournal.com/ LiveJournal].

As soon as this drama unfolded, {{ljuser|dragontigerclaw}} chooses to [[delete fucking everything|delete all entries]] of the Sarah saga from {{ljcomm|housematehorror}}, without any explanation.
