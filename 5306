'''Menstrual painting''' (also called "'''blood art'''") is the practice where women paint shitty, terrible pictures using their period blood for paint and get asspats for being liberated.  They save the blood up in old spaghetti sauce jars each month. It was an art started at least [[100 years ago]] by [[Cracky-Chan]] ([[pedo|/b/tard]]) who used menstrual blood to paint her topless body when she was 15 and then uploading her homemade child porn to the internet.  No doubt this is actually an attempt to give the whole world [[AIDS]].

Menstrual painting is often done alone because they are aware of how shameful it is, how disgusting they truly are, and that no one will see it as an [[insane|expression of their womanhood]].  Also because it is hard to get two women on their period at the same time in the same room for extended peri-...amounts of time without them [[murder|killing each other]].

<blockquote>i recently started collecting the blood in a [[The Keeper|big jar]], so i can do i big painting (or a series of little ones).  HOWEVER, it's been a month since i started. And since i started a new cycle today, i opened the jar to add more...  and it smelled SO, SO BAD. I mean, it was horrendous. The smell filled my room within a few seconds.  I was wondering if this was normal? Or is it because i used a jar that formerly contained chopped garlic? That would make a lot of sense to me.</blockquote>

And the response:
<blockquote>If you needed to make a big painting, I'd suggest mixing the blood with a clear acrylic gloss or something. I'm not sure how long that would last, either, though, but it'd probably keep stuff from growing in it.</blockquote>

== The Public's Reaction ==

This "[[shit|art]]" is fucking [[goatse|disgusting]] and very, very unhygienic. It would have looked just as [[shit|good]] if it had been painted with regular red paint or fucking crayon, but since the majority of people are [[sick fucks]], they feel the need to go out of their way to destroy everything that is [[porn|beautiful]] in the world.

The douchebag who saved blood in a jar should have just killed someone and used their blood. Hey, at least she'd look like less of a moron.

==Menstraul Painting how to==
Don't, it's as simple as that. If [[you]] even think for a second of menstraul painting, than you are a [[sick fuck]] [[lesbian]] bulldyke and [[fail]] miserably at [[IRL|life]]. The only [[final solution|solution]] to this case is to [[an hero]].
