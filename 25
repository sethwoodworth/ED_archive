'''/sci/''' is 4chan's [[Math]] and [[Science]] board. While [[Unrealistic expectations|theoretically]] one of the most serious boards on [[4chan]], it is constantly plagued by [[troll]]s from [[b|/b/]] and [[retard|high school students]] asking for help with their [[math]] homework. <s>Since its creation in January [[2010]], /sci/ has been a refuge from desktop threads for many serious [[g|/g/]]eeks.</s> [[DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|DISREGARD THAT, /sci/ SUCKS COCKS]]

[[Image:scimaff.jpg|thumb|right| A breakdown of /sci/'s treatment of math threads.]]
A large portion of the posts on /sci/ are requests for help with math homework, generally from [[13 year old boy]]s struggling with pre-algebra. Although officially a bannable offense, homework threads fag up /sci/ because there are no mods.

===How can you believe in evolution if its only a theory (a geuss)?===
An excellent method of trolling in its original sense, as anyone who's spent at least an hour on /sci/ has seen this exact question dozens of times.  Someone invariably responds with "How can you believe in induction if its only a theory (a gauss)?" to cries of "LOLOLOL" and "SO.  MUCH.  WIN." from /sci/'s humor-challenged denizens (in other words, everyone).
===How is [[????]] an evolutionary advantage?===
Made by mentally [[retard]]ed [[13 year old boys]] who have not taken high school biology. The answer is always [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution#Genetic_drift genetic drift], also [[sage]].
===Are [[Engineers]] Scientists?===
<s>Yes. Move the fuck along.</s>  Disregard that, engineers suck cocks 24/7, leaving no time for science or anything else.

===So what is a good college?===
Threads made by angsty teens who are butthurt at their [[MIT]] rejection letters due to low [[SAT]] scores.
===0.9999999999... * 0.9999999999... = 1===
As if a few retarded teenagers could solve a puzzle that has plagued math professors for centuries.
===Is [[????]] science?===
Butthurt [[Oxymoron|social "science"]] majors frequently make threads trying to defend why the suffix science is placed on their piece of shit major.
===What will the future be like?===
Typically these threads are made by [[pothead]]s who have no fucking clue about science and end with wildly silly predictions about the future of humanity.

===Joke time===
To be ended quickly and effectively with this copypasta:
An infinite number of mathematicians, a polar bear, helium, and a neutrino walk into a bar (ouch). One of the mathematicians then says, "the bar is now empty" and they begin to play hide and seek. The neutrino is then stopped by a police officer. Officer Heisenberg says, "Do you know how fast you were going back there?" The neutrino replies, "I'm positive and a pascal but I don't know where I am." The bar tender then says "You're all idiots, the cows are all black" and pours 10 (in base 2, i mean 10) drinks and there is an extra dollar. The polar bear then dissolves in water while the helium does not react.
===YOU RAGE YOU LOSE===
Typically a link to a ho-hum YouTube clip in which a stupid person says something stupid against evolution.  A circle-jerk shitstorm of mutual congratulation invariably ensues as /sci/'s insecure atheists reassure each other that they are all SOOOO much smarter than those silly creationists, a fact that is indisputable but doesn't bear repeating 200 times.  The combo is occasionally broken by a 0/10 post purporting to agree with the creationist, which even the aspies manage to see through.

==IRC Channel==
There is a shitty [[IRC]] channel on [[Rizon]] called #/sci/.  More /sci/dling goes on than science, but scientists don't really do anything anyways.

==[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air|The Fresh Illini Nuke]] [[Engineer]]==
Well /sci/, do I have a story for you.

I am a nuclear engineer at the University of Illinois, and today was my first day doing research in the nuclear engineering lab. I assist a doctoral student with... things (I don't want to say because anyone who knows me would immediately know who I am). I can assure you though, it is nuclear engineering stuff.

Anyway, last night, I had to read an article on this special piece of equipment I would be calibrating. I had to find the article and stuff myself, so I googled it. For whatever reason, I could not find the EXACT piece of equipment, but I found one that I assumed was the same thing (it had a dash and then some numbers after the product name, I figured it should be basically the same).

I read this whole instruction manual on how to calibrate it and stuff, and it ends up being like twenty pages long. I read it slowly and carefully to make sure I remember everything and will be able to do my job tomorrow.

So this morning, I head to the lab to meet my professor, who asks me if I read what I was supposed to and will know what to do, to which I respond yes. Despite the twenty pages of reading, the procedure was actually pretty simple (or so it seemed).

I was led into the adjacent room, which was dimly lit. The walls were all concrete (cheap material with good halving thickness in case things go wrong) and the building itself just felt musty. He sat me down in front of a machine saying, "I'll be in the next room if you need any help."

Well let me tell ya /sci/, I needed help. This machine didn't look much at all like what I had read about. At first, I wasn't even sure if it had ANY similar functions. After a couple minutes of close inspection, I determined that it was a little similar to what I had read about; close enough that I was fairly certain I could calibrate it and make a good first work impression on my professor (he knew my past work and academic history, but I wanted to show him I would be a valuable asset).

I switched the thing on, and was greeted by a constant humming noise after a few seconds. So far so good. I first tuned the voltage to the correct setting, and everything still seemed peachy. Unfortunately, I failed to realize a small light on the back that was flashing to indicate an inconsistency with some of the frequency settings. 

Had I read the CORRECT manual, I would have noticed the light (who puts an important light in the back, anyways?), and I would NOT have tried to tune the resistance next. Well I did, and I began to hear a quiet whining noise that started to grow louder. If anything, I could say that this sound was rare, but I thought, "Nahh, forget it. Yo Homes, to Bel-Air!" I pulled up to the house at bout seven or eight, I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home, smell ya later!' I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there! To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air!
