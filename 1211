'''''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''''' was a mid-season replacement on the WB network, based on a movie that was [[Fail|a box-office flop]]. From this, one would deduce a recipe for a [[shit]]ty television show that would trot out thirteen episodes, but only get to air ten. Instead, the show ran up until recently, spawned a five-season spin-off, and has a massive [[internets]] fandom as well as the attention of otherwise serious media critics. 

==History==
The series followed the exploits of a [[sex]]y vampire hunter / Jew broad who refused to provide any [[boob shots]] to her adoring fans. [[midget|SMG]] will always be known to the world as Buffy, whether she likes it or not.  Because of excellent casting of all the people who had to deal with her obnoxious personality (a [[ginger]] nerdslut, a dorky guy, a British librarian, a good-guy vampire, and [[ginger]] Seth Green), the series spawned lots of [[slash]] [[fanfiction]], as well as a guild of [[LiveJournal]] users who wrote non-slash diaries in the voices of the characters. It has also been known to be a pain in the ass to any Slayer fan, because every time they search for Slayer on the internets, they have to look at lesbo vampires instead.

==[[Lesbian]]ity==
Much like fans of ''[[Smallville]]'', Buffy fans should be approached with caution. This is especially true of BTVS's [[Lesbian|lesbian]] fans, who -- when the aforementioned nerdslut turned out to be a Really, For Real, No [[SRSLY]] GUYS [[Lesbian]], who was not ugly, and had a [[orly|very quality-portrayed relationship]] with another girl who also was not ugly, lost aforementioned second not-ugly Real Live [[Lesbian]] to a death that made complete sense to the story and was preceded ''within the same episode'' by the first Actual, No I'm Serious, [[Lesbian]] Sex ''ever'' shown on [[FOX News|syndicated network TV]] -- could '''only''' focus on the fact that "yet another" [[Lesbian|lesbian]] character had been "killed off". 

There is a postscript to all this that is actually interesting to people other than the [[Lesbian|fucking dykes on this site who won't shut the fuck up]]. [[Joss Whedon]], no doubt responding to his own [[Liberal guilt|liberal guilt]], heeded their plaintive [[Internet|OL]] wailing: He gave the nerdslut a new, very stupid but much hotter girlfriend, with whom she had ''still more'' Real For-Sure I-Mean-It [[Lesbian|lesbian]] [[sex]] -- this time instructing [[Pedo|watchers]] on the correct use of tongue barbells, no less. So you see, the [[Internet|internets]] really ''do'' give [[Hippie|power to the people and shit, man]].

==[[Joss Whedon]]==
Joss Whedon, the show's author and resident deity, is responsible for rhetorical [[masturbation]] all over the [[internets]].  He wrote the movie "''Buffy, Slayer of the Vampyres''" that the [[old media|television show]] was based off of, as well as the spinoff series, ''[[Angel]]'', the National Geographic special "''Firefly''", and was George Lucas's [[Bitch|ghostwriter]] for the newest ''[[Star Wars]]''. His latest film, a philosophical [[Cowboy|Western]] with absolutely no vampires called "''Serenity''", sucked.
People remain obsessed with this shitty show, especially [[virgins]] who frequent the message board [[Television Without Pity]]. 
It barely matters what you're trying to discuss, either ''[[Buffy]]'' will inevitably come into the conversation or the Lord God and Master of all things Great and Good in TV, [[evar]], [[Joss Whedon]] will.

==Cloned==
[[Image:Charmedalyssa.jpeg|thumb|There are only six reasons to watch ''Charmed'', here are two of them]]
Since all Hollywood producers are Jew, BTVS was ripped off by Jew Spelling who stole ''Buffy'''s premise and plots to make the series '''''Charmed'''''. He claimed he actually stole the idea from a movie by the same title but no one buys that [[bullshit]]. Spelling put his creative signature on the show by costuming the lead characters as trailer trash whores and, to ensure [[verisimilitude]], by casting actual trailer trash whores in the roles.

The clone has particular appeal for young women who wish to fight the forces of evil with their [[Wicca|supernatural powers]] while wearing halter tops, stiletto heels, and glitter eyeshadow. [http://www.thecharmedones.com/ The Charmed Ones] official web site has announced their budget has been cut for the next season, meaning the [[Whore|stars]] will wear no clothing at all and will substitute old copies of "''Bewitched''" episodes for new scripts. This is expected to increase entertainment quality and viewership enormously.

Recently, [[Idiots|experts at Hollywood studios]] have pooled their cash to write and release a new film about Buffy that has had absolutely no input from [[Joss Whedon]].  They probably don't know what BtVS is about besides [[vampires]] whoring themselves to [[12_year_old_girls|human girls who like to nail sexy dead people]]. This has absolutely everything to do with the success of [[Twilight]], which also has a "[[pussy|vampire]]" who falls in "[[rape|love]]" with a "[[sheep|sensitive and unique]]" main character. The plan may backfire, as any [[Twitard]] will freeze up and turn tail when she realizes Buffy actually stakes her precious, cuddly vampires. Everyone else will decide to go buy the actual show on DVD.

==STOP PRESS! SMG POSES NAKED!==

Or did she? As Sellout Michelle Gellar has a no-nudity clause in her contract, her agent [[lies|claims]] that she posed in a dress, and the skin colors were [[shoop|shooped]] over it.

Hmm. [[bullshit|HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.]]

The punchline? The advert she posed for is for Vaseline [[masturbation|hand lotion]].
