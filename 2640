Emilie Autumn
[[Image:OriginalCoverSm.jpg|thumb|"I'm an artist, honest! This is ironic!!!" No, you're just a dumb bitch with little tits. No one cares about your music. (Hey, I can do the rhyming thing too!)]]

'''Emilie Autumn''' is a musician who has been around since before corsets, wheelchairs, dinosaurs, unicorns and goats were around. Because every body knows she invented them. However, she has become popular in the recent years among [[Goth|gawfik]] [[16 year old girls|tweens]] filled with angst and darkness. She is still rather underground (though she likes to think that she's [[Whore|well-known]] enough for [[Lady Gaga]] to have stolen parts of her stage-show) and has some [[80 year old Chinese man in panties|mature fans]] who don't shit themselves over everything she touches. However, [[80 year old Chinese man in panties|mature fans]] are incredibly rare, and unlikely to be found anywhere around anything to do with Emilie as they are not "true muffins" and are often [[banned]], [[killed]] or [[abused]] on sight. 

Emilie Autumn fans often insist they be called [[Vagina|muffins]]. Because Emilie Autumn has called them that [[over 9000|once or twice]]. She also likes to make it clear at all times that she suffers from [[bipolar disorder]] and is not responsible at all for herself. Her [[Vagina|muffins]] got stirred into an outrage from an interview in Kerrang! which focused upon Emilie's [[mental disorders]] rather than her music. (Please note: On that day, not a fuck was given outside of the Asylum.)

In a recent interview she was described as "RATS, HOT, MADNESS!", which sums her up pretty well. She may have invented the wheel itself, but it seems she is struggling to invent new music for herself, having not released an actual new song in forever.

She's also [[retard|super smart and original in everything]]. EVERYTHING! Question this, and suffer the consequences of immediate bannhammering or [[Death]].
She likes to pretend that she's a year younger than she actually is, and if anyone questions that, they get the same [[Death|treatment]].
Oh, and she has convinced everyone she's a [[Bullshit|direct descendant of Alice Liddell]] even though her real last name is Fritzges. FRITZGES.


== The Music ==
"Victoriandustrial" is what Emilie Autumn calls her music, because she is [[Trying too hard|so original]] that [[noone]] can define her. Some of her music is actually pretty good if you change the lyrics, voice, cords, beat, awful violin that sounds like two pieces of steel [[sex|going at it]] and just about everything else. Yeah, it's pretty good music. 

Since she finished invented the wheel, the door, television, cheese, and everything else, she's been touring on the same CD for close to forever now. And each tour has been named as if entering The Asylum where she lives:

* The Asylum
* [[AIDS|The Plague]]
* [[GOATSE|The Gate]]
* The Gate II
* The Key
* The Door

But seeing as she feels she hasn't made everyone sick of the same shit over and over and over again...she also has these tours planned:

* The Foyer
* The Hallway
* The Garage
* The Backdoor That You Have To Really Slam Your Shoulder Into Because It Sticks Easily
* The Game Over tour ...Then it starts over with the Gate, the Key, The Doorknob, the Pasties storage room tour etc

==Stage Persona==
[[File:Scary_Lady.jpg|thumb|Emilie Autumn during [[Period|that time of the month]].]]

Emilie Autumn likes to pretend she's a [[poor]], [[insane]] girl from Victorian [[England]] and a direct descendant of Alice Liddell (of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''). Many of her [[crazy|beloved]] muffins have bought in on this and lap up any of the shit she spouts with eager tongues. 
Her tours and shows used to be something worth watching. She started off having a awesome stage show full of audience participation, theatrics and actual violin playing and singing.
It is now her and her Bloody Crumpets running around stage with next to no clothes, mimed violin playing, hardly any singing and lots of [[angst|rage]] over a [[Pedobear|teddybear]], Suffer, stolen a year ago at a Europe show.
(But, of course, she can't be held accountable for the shitstorm her shows actually are. After all, it's her [[mental disorders]] that make her act this way.)

The Bloody Crumpets are her listless women who live with her in an Asylum in the fantasy persona world. During shows they simply wander around the stage, looking lost, and occasionally spit tea over the audience. Whenever one of the girls claims to have invented something that Emilie herself has not approved of, the banhammer comes down and they are unceremoniously kicked from the Asylum to never be seen again. Therefore, the line up of Bloody Crumpets is subject to change.

Emilie Autumn's stage costumes are known for [[goth|corsets and short skirts covered]] in [[glitter]] to make up for bad construction since she ditched her seamstress. 

There is a [[book]] written by her all about her stage persona that is supposed to be a mix of fiction and [[USI|biography]] and named ''The Asylum For Wayward Victorian Girls.'' It depicts even more about her [[mental disorders]] and talks of a girl named "Emily" (WITH A Y SO IT CAN'T BE THE BELOVED EMIL'IE', NOW, CAN IT?! HOW DARE YOU SUGGEST SUCH A THING. MISTRESS DISAPPROVES.)

She also likes to tell people who piss her off to "GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!" even if it's a forum, stage, street... Apparently, [[insane|the Asylum is everywhere.]] If you disagree, then would you kindly get out of my house, you fucking patronizing fucking..

==OH-EM-GEE, EMILIE IS LIEK, ASEXUAL==

Except that she doesn't seem to really get what [[asexual]] means...
{{quote| '''''About your sexuality; what are your tendencies? Are you hetero, bi, lesbian...?'''''

I think for the most part I feel asexual, which is a kind like you are not completely attracted to either men or women, is in between spaces which is almost as to be bisexual, because you don't have a real choice. I've been with men, of course, but I love women so much (and you can see it on stage) ...and that's what men think: "oh, this is what women do?" that doesn't make me a lesbian, it's just what happened. But at the same time there's a part that I don't like, and is to don't be on only one side, because it makes me confuse. And often I watch all from the outside, and I watch all as it is fine, and I respect it. I'm just proud that more and more people show their own tendencies and sexuality in a more free way, I speak even about my shows, where there's a "lesbian marriage" every night. We started like a joke, and it develop in a very good thing, where people feel more and more comfortable to show themselves.|Uhh...yeah.}}

== Fans ==

[[File:Emilie Autumn by Diamonds Hearts.jpg|thumb|{{quote|Muffin that is stunning!!
That is one of my all time favourite photos of her and you did a beautiful job at drawing it! <3}}]]


Muffins of Emilie Autumn are usually [[16 year old girls|pre-teens to teens]], or at least seem to [[retarded|have that mentality]]. They are oh so [[goth|gawfik]] and [[emo|no one understands them]], that's why the have to worship Emilie Autumn, because she is [[crazy|a Goddess]], and give her their Suffering that she asks for in her music. Listening to an underground artist like Autumn makes them oh-so-cool and her using violins makes it classical and gawfik and unique, just like them. Muffins are also called "Plague Rats", a title they accept as readily as her bullshit Liddell history. They achieve this status by 'spreading the plague' of her music.

All Emilie Autumn muffins claim to be extremely insane and can often convince a [[fisting|handful]] of just as retarded people. Although most muffins don't know anything about their claimed form of insanity. They don't go for the pansy mental disorders either, [[sex|fuck]] no, the crazier they are the bigger an Emilie Autumn muffin they are.

There are few exceptions to this rule of people who like Emilie Autumn's music and are [[lie|actually mature and intelligent adults]]. However, they have been labeled to not be "true muffins" and are generally hated by the true muffins and are banned from [http://forum.emilieautumn.com/index.php?sid=ed2e92dd3177d34d2b63cca8e2799373 Emilie Autumn's forum] the moment they disagree with Emilie or a mod and show their lack of faith.

{{quote|Naaawww!! That is so cute!! Omg, i cant get over how adorable that is!!|The speech of a typical Emilie Autumn fan}}
{{quote|Wasted sun rise<br/>
[[emo|Running after other people’s expectations<br/>
Unreachable dreams<br/>
Like stars always shining in my face<br/>
And my screams their sky<br/>
A confused mirror<br/>
Is unsure of what to reflect in front of me<br/>
Glimpse of self-awareness in pain<br/>
Happy seconds buried by the hours of torment<br/>
In a road away from light<br/>
Any moment of happiness<br/>
Has been chemically induced<br/>
I took more than what I could handle<br/>
As I crawl in a pavement made of nails<br/>
Towards my emptiness<br/>]]
|Shitty poetry shows suffering. This feeds the Emi-God.}}



=== Signs Of An EA Muffin ===
*Likes [[goth|gawfik]] fashion
*[[Lie|Hot]]
*Calls Emilie Autumn a goddess or mistress.
*Claims to love classical music, but has little knowledge on the subject
*Is full of [[emo|angst]] because their parents won't let them dye their hair pink or wear corsets
*Tries to develop Victorian mannerisms
*Goes on about how they love tea
*Claims to suffer from Bipolar, Schizophrenia, Psychosis, OCD, Split personality, ADD, and whatever else they can think of.
*Tries to become Vegan to be more like their goddess
*Owns rats and names them "Teacup", "Opheliac" and other gawfick names.
*Has a piece of clothing with the phrases "Ophelliac", "Plague Rat", or "Are You Suffering" on it.
*Some [[whore|fans]] may wear a corset. Of course, in order to fit into the corset, not being a [[fat|gothapotamous]] helps.

They should in most cases be avoided at all costs. Nobody is safe from the botherers; They'll steal your soul and eat your crisps. If the subject of Emilie Autumn is brought up, run! [[Hipsters|Say nothing negative or they will become violent!]]

== The Drama ==

[[File:Cap1.gif|thumb| EA says STFU]]

[[File:Cap2y.gif|thumb|Have an opinion? Fuck that!]]

[[File:Cap3.gif|thumb|Blah blah blah guilt blah blah bi-polar blah blah fuck you]]

[[File:Cap5.gif|thumb|Did you disagree with Emilie? Well let me tell you...]]

'''''It all began one day when...'''''

Emilie Autumn decided to leave her recording company and go to The End records because the others were controlling and wanted her to go [[Pop music|mainstream]]. On the move she re-re-re-released her second CD, ''Ophelliac''.

Some people on the forum had the stupidity to go against Emilie's wishes and show less than total support. Of course, this caused Emilie to go into a [[angst|RAAAAAGE]]. And she promptly put them down with harsh [[sarcasm]] and large words and questioning her worth to make them feel like the guilty and horrible people they were for questioning her motives.

A member on the forum known as 'CosetteAlice' told Emilie to clam down and have tea (Tea being the poison of choice in the Asylum, obviously). All hell broke lose as Emilie told the "fucking patronizing fucking" girl who dared to tell her what to do. <s>Fans</s> <s>Muffins</s> Plague Rats backed Emilie Autumn up and told the girl to [[GTFO]] because she wasn't a [[retard|true fan]].
Thus began the banhammering of anyone who didn't and doesn't [[kinky|lick Emilie's sparkly pink boots]].



=== Just Pretend It Never Happened ===
Everyone was told to STFU about the incident and go on with their lives. Question the banning? Banhammer. Imply Emilie was wrong? Banhammer. It worked for a long time.

=== Not An Object, Except I Am ===

{{quote|Nothing I say or feel is legitimate, not ever ever ever because I'm bipolar|That's exactly right, Emilie }}



Drama started up again when Emilie Autumn decided to abandon her principles of not being an [[woman|object]] as she made clear in her songs ( [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwmKqZGORm8 Thank God I'm Pretty] to instead do a <s>strip show</s> '''''burlesque'' show'''. There were wheelchairs, (which she invented) blood and fake suicide. You know, to make it super-duper unique and [[artistic]] and gawfik. The wheelchair idea was, of course, then 'stolen' by Lady GaGa (more about that below).

Afterward she began to [[Epic Win|take off her shirt]] at acts and before the show she had done a photo shoot of her in a corset and glittery pasties.
Please note, Emilie Autumn has insisted all of it was done [[irony|"ironically"]]. She stripped ironically, dances around a stage in next-to-nothing for the case of irony, took her shirt off ironically and has a gold stripper pole in her room, all to be ironic.<sup>[[citation needed|ORLY?]]</sup>

Then she had an article about her in [[Playboy]], basically passing her off as nothing but a hot chick. She was super excited and [[Twitter|tweeted]] about how all her loyal muffins would support her in it. And those who disapproved of their Emi-God getting her 'pasties' out for the general public were immediately [[killed]].

Following this her concerts began to show [[Paris Hilton|more flesh and less talent]], all in an apparent [[hipster|"ironic"]] move in order to look super [[gawfik]] and [[original]]. And her claim was that Muffins should be proud. [[Internet tough guy|OR SUFFER!]]

=== Something is off here ===
Slowly, some <s>muffins</s> UNLOYAL PEOPLE began to realize that it was all kind of [[bullshit]]. After two claimed 'robberies' (aka thieves took all my recording shit and presents for all of you but left computers and expensive instruments and we were all home while it happened!), a band [[RIAA|'stealing' her music]] and her ex-boyfriend, [[douchebag|Billy Corgan]] being a jerk towards her, some people started to question Emilie Autumn's truthfulness. They were mercilessly silenced with the banhammer and guilt.

Shortly after Emilie Autumn had a falling out with a make-up company she had been working with, Aromaliegh. The owner of Aromaliegh, MissK posted on Emilie's forum that the two would no longer be working together because Emilie could not fulfill her side of the business agreement. For daring to post something that made Emilie seem less than perfect MissK was banned and all talk of Aromaleigh was silenced.

For many unloyal fans this was the last straw and they began to go against Emilie Autumn.

This is forbidden, of course and super-bitch mod Flee, promptly swung the banhammer at all. 'Restrictions' were set on people without any warning and anyone her questioned Flee's justice was banned or guilted into silence.

Some of these restrictions included:
* [[lolwut|All sexual content is banned from Emilie's forum, yet she often is seen half-naked and encouraged fans to buy Playboy]]
* Anything seen as even slightly rude is a banning offense, yet mods often talk down to member and Emilie Autumn has recently taken to abusing Lady Gaga over Twitter.
* No slow chatting! You know, unless you're Emilie or a mod, then it's okay.
* Be creative and share it! As long as it's about Emilie only.

{{quote|To be honest, I have no idea of what the hell happened with Aromaleigh...|EA admits for once that she is cluseless}}

This inspired a large amount of people to abandon the forum with epic posts calling Emilie Autumn out as a [[attention whore|fame-whore]] and a [[YOU LIE!|liar]]. This blew many minds of the Muffins and resulted in massive bannings with mods telling users to take their lack of faith elsewhere. 

However, upon the users taking their non-believing asses to the Reform, they were told if they said shit about Emilie they would face the wrath of the Flee! [[Russians|Spies]] were found on the new forum and banned promptly after giving the team of Emilie Autumn's forum something to rage about.

== Lady Gaga Stole It ==
Most recently Emilie Autumn has decided to make [[Lady Gaga]] the source of her rage at her lack of fame, claiming she used wheelchairs first "I know it. My label knows it. Everyone knows it. [[Delusional|Truth]]" and that Alejandro made her want to [[An Hero|"blow my brains out."]] Lady Gaga fans came to the rescue, [[WIN|letting her know they'd be happy to help her with that]].

Emilie has now decided to cover a Lady Gaga song for teh [[lulz]], and has been taking suggestions from fans, leading to this very charming exchange:

{{quote|So, if I were to cover a Lady Gaga song, which should it be, PRs? Only ever heard a couple that happened to be on the radio, don't know any.|Yet Emilie knows Gaga's songs well enough to "blow her brains out" when she hears Alejandro...}}

{{quote|@emilieautumn if you really wanted to be vengeful, you could do a vicious parody of Speechless, the song about her ill father. >:D

@Semirhage666 Wouldn't it be fucking hilarious?? And so very wrong?|Yup. Emilie, who rails against people who have caused her suffering, is quite happy to take advantage of others'. Oh, and so are her fans!}}

Oh, and, isn't it funny that this tweet from EarAche...

{{quote|Have I mentioned that the Asylum Tea in pretty golden tea tins will be available at the merch stand on the Fall tour for the first time?}}

...appears only a little while after [http://www.take40.com/news/19695/lady-gaga-to-endorse-twinings-tea!- this announcement]? ;)

== The Reform ==
The Reform is a forum created for those who disagreed with Emilie Autumn and were told to take the shit elsewhere. Emilie Autumn is occasionally the butt of many jokes there and the board even has a number of their own version of memes about her. The board has since taken to the idea of merely using Emilie Autumn Refuge as a foothold, and moving on to a number of other things, be the concepts makeup, Monty Python, circuses, or sad-sexy smilies.

They've also developed their own in-forum memes such as
* Anything that is similar to another member's post gets a reaction of "I did it first! Truth!"
* There is a version of advice dog with Emilie Autumn giving career advice
* There is also GlitterTits. Emilie's pastie adorned tits giving orders to all those still loyal.
* Emilie Autumn has also been placed in a few different memes
* A favorite is about how Lady Gaga 'stole' from Emilie without even knowing who Emilie is.

Glittertits knows what's best.

== Fuck With The Mods ==
This has become a favorite game of many [[atheist|non-believers]] of how fast you can get banned from the forum. Some take the subtle approach, others go around spamming the shit out of everything. Either way, mods get pissed and confused and everyone has lulz.
