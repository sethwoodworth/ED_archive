{{stop|APB needs more drama, lulz and Internets, and it's not hard to do. The game was so bad it sunk the studio,<br>and the details of the whole debacle were leaked on a forum by a disgruntled employee.}}

'''''APB: All Points Bulletin''''', made by Realtime Worlds, is a massive load of gay that was attempting to take on ''World of Warcraft''. The idea was to have two factions (cops and robbers, but that's not what they call them) continuously at war in an open world. It also gives "unprecedented access" to editors for clothing, music, cars, graffiti etc. etc. Sounds good in concept, but it falls flat on its face in reality, due to reasons such as:

*Lag
*The whole game being biased towards the cops.
*Continuous bitching and moaning in the chat every five seconds.
*Lag.
*Cops being able to chase you if they see you even knocking over a sign.
*Missions being repeated pretty much every 5 minutes.
*PVP missions allow cops/robbers who are much stronger than you to join and kick your head in.
*More Lag.
*Vehicles feel terrible to drive.
*You have to grind for infinity bajillion years to get any of the decent cars/weapons (WOWfags are probably accustomed to this.)
*Cops having access to guns that stun robbers (making them unable to move or fire) allowing to arrest them/kill them (both do pretty much the same thing) incredibly easily.
*Vehicle/Clothing editors are painful to use.
*Much more La- You get the idea.

This game actually made Realtime Worlds go bankrupt and into administration. That is how shit it is. And it lasted like two months.

==HOLY SHIT==
[https://twitter.com/#!/benbateman Ben Batemen of Codemasters mentioned APB's patch notes for a potential buyout and resurrection. OH SHIIIIITTTTT.]

[http://www.massively.com/2010/10/24/rumor-apb-buyout-apparently-nearing-the-light-at-the-end-of-th/ Will it come back?]

[http://pc.ign.com/articles/113/1134786p1.html Some other studio wants to take a crack at running this shitty MMO, but with a free to play system this time. Because they know it sucks and hope that people will think "Hey if it's free it cannot be that bad."]
