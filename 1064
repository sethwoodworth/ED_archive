Bob
[[Image:Dobbshead.jpg|thumb|left|.]]
'''J.R. "Bob" Dobbs''', much like [[Cthulhu]], [[Star Wars|Darth Vader]], and [[Jameth]], is a real person whose larger-than-life story serves to inspire countless legions of [[retarded]], [[basement-dwelling]], [[RL]]-[[OTI|shunning]] [[faggots]].

"Bob" (always written in quotation marks, due to [[faggotry]]) is the figurehead of the [[Church of the SubGenius]], a fake [[religion]] made up by a bunch of pseudointellectual tardlings and art poseurs.  Created as a spoof or mockery of "[[Wicca|New]] [[Paganism|Age]]" religions, the SubGenius faithful claim that "Bob" built a [[TV]] and saw [[Jehovah]] 1, Space God of [[Wrath]] on it, then started a religion and a whole bunch of other [[unfunny]] crap.

The image of "Bob" is based on old 1950's clip art, featuring a smiling man smoking a pipe.  The Church has [[copyrighted]] the image, although to date, no [[internet lawsuit]]s have been filed regarding its use.

There is one [[Basement-dweller|basement-dwelling]] [[assclown]] that is [[intellectually insufficient]] enough to try to claim to be "Bob" simply by calling himself [[Bob Dobbs]], but he only dupes morons so stupid that even the [[Church of the Subgenius|Church]] doesn't want them around (oh, and, unfortunately, the band Negativeland too, but only briefly).
