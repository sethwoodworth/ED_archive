Vital article
<center>[[Image:Vital article.jpg]]</center>
'''Vital articles''' are [[TOW]]'s conception of what every [[encyclopedia]] should have, because they, as the unpaid experts, [[USI|believe they have the right]] to pass judgement on the rest of the world. As with the [[good article]], the vital article can be identified either through a list, or through the [[talk page]], which if you scroll down may have a [[faggotry|Version 1.0 Editioral Team]] banner, which has a toggling show/hide thing which reveals the ugly beast that is the vital article.

Since TOW aims to be a [[boobpedia|broad encyclopedia]] with no [[conservapedia|bias towards any particular worldview]], it has vital articles in a wide range of categories in terms of the sorts of things that you might be taught in [[school]] or [[college]]. Most of these are relatively [[unfunny]], but [[lulz]] can be achieved by watching [[edit war]]s or by adding your own, [[creative]] additions to the vital article list... [[mudkips]] anyone?

==The Fucked Up List==

In terms of geography, they're clearly biased. How come [[Austria]], [[Europe|Belgium]], [[Ireland]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]] are vital articles? These little Eurostates are vital when [[Argentina]], [[Portugal]], and [[Tajikistan|Kazakhstan]] are not? It's because [[Jimbo]] is biased towards [[whitey|the Anglosphere]] and Northern/[[nazi|Germanic]] Europe and wherever these people or their descendents settled, that's why - in all his years of watching and producing [[porn]] Jimbo has never had a good [[blowjob]] from and given [[buttsecks]] to a [[Colombia]]n [[whore|girl]]. This also explains why Jimbo is [[BFF]] with [[Virgins vs. Virgin|Richard Branson]] and [[Tony Blair]] - because all [[moralfag|project an image of doing good]] when they put their own personal greed over freedom of [[bullshit|information]], speech and the right not to be [[torture]]d at Guantanamo Bay for having a non-white complexion!

[[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], the most reputable encyclopedia the world has ever known, defies the vital article list. The majority of the vital articles are not included in ED, but does it suffer? No, not at all. In fact, it just keeps on riding the [[Alexa]] [[mantrain|train]] higher and higher up the mountain bypass!
