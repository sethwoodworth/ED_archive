== Sekret Identity Crisis ==

Ashida Kim is a made-up name; "Ashida" is probably a Japanese name, but "Kim" is definitely Korean.  Even the average [[anime]] dork could do better, if only by stealing names from their favorite videos.

His real name is Radford W. Davis, and you can't get much [[White|whiter]] than that.  His frat-boy, mayonnaise-chomping whiteness has not stopped him from writing a bunch of books about [[ninja]] stuff.  [[Amazon]] is on his shit list, so the books are presumably not selling all that well.  He is also out to get [[Wikipedia]] and [[Paladin-Press]], but is too wimpy to get his [[Fandom|followers]] to go after them old-school ninja style.  [[Bullshit|(As if they fucking could.)]]  Instead, he calls for a boycott on them, as if any of his fans have money.

Speaking of...

== Ashida Kim, Food Stamp Ninja ==

In the course of a recent lawsuit against him, Radford had to tell the court [http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/massachusetts/madce/1:2007cv11673/111449/28/ that he lives with his mommy, has no job], [http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/massachusetts/madce/1:2007cv11673/111449/29/ makes less than $300 a month, owes $600 a month, and owns nothing but a half-share of a 1991 Ford pickup truck].  He had to swear to this by the Ninjer Gods, so it has to be true.  I guess the fake martial artist racket isn't paying much these days.  

== Ashida Kim, Rock Star ==

In an attempt to suck even more, Kimmy has put up [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXm8MFUMFyQ a wannabe rock video] showing off his mad [[skillz]]. He waves his hands around, transforms into a fucking tengu or something, turns invisible using absolutely no special effects at all (honest!), and fights a series of nobodies.  When this video was first linked here, he ran in circles, yanking at his nipples and howling, and then had embedding disabled.

== Ashida Kim, Porn Star ==

Kim once worked as a [http://www.dojopress.com/catalogbk41.html bouncer at an African brothel] and still couldn't get laid. However, his ghost writer was happy to make up a book about what Kim wishes he had done, using transcripts from 70's porno flicks and random cereal box copy. A film script of the book is available should any disgraced Bollywood director wish to film two hours of Kim's withered, pustule riddled ass and nads plunging repeatedly into some skank's greenly steaming, mephitic slimehole.

Kim wants to be a movie star so badly that he is proud to be [http://ashidakim.com/movie-credits.html an uncredited extra in shitty movies of yesteryear]. He likes to play the part of an invisible ninja, which makes his [http://ashidakim.com/pics/autograph.jpg flaccid penis, tattooed in tactical black with his name in gold], tremble fitfully as it tries to erect itself.

== Ashida Kim, First Level Magic User ==

In this demonstration of Ninja magic, Kim does his [[Bill Gates]] impersonation, displays his adorable little toe sox, and then lifts his legs into the air as a doughy assistant listlessly doodles a hula hoop around his scrawny ass. Kim then plays with his balls for about two minutes.Its a small miracle anyone ever believed he was a real ninja.

== Ashida Kim, Martial Artist of the Future ==

Kim has taken the final step into insanity with [http://dojopress.com/catalogbk88.html his book on twenty-first-century combat].  Where do we fucking start?  That it's already the twenty-first century?  That light saber fights are [[Star_Wars_Kid|teh st00pid]]?  That he put up a video of himself fighting with a [[redneck|swamp-tard]] [[cripple]] who can't even move away from the wall at his back because his fucking legs don't work?  That the "alien horn spear" looks [[gay|gayer]] than a two-headed [[dildo]]? After this video, Ashida was beaten like a Two Dollar whore by his Mom for not returning the light sabers to the Community Day Care where he stays at while his Mom works at the local Bar.

Watch them duel over which of them has eaten the most roadkill:

== Exposure And Retreat ==

After experiencing much [[butthurt]] at the hands of [[Bullshido]], a site that  exposes martial arts frauds, Ashida painted his ass white and ran with the antelope.  He may occasionally be found sodomizing prairie dogs in Wyoming and running away from fights with ten-year-old [[girl]]s.  He excuses this by [http://ashidakim.com/Akonwar.html claiming that it is contrary to ninja ethics to hurt your enemy].  [[Seriously]]

== Ashida Kim Is Dead ==

[[Some argue]] that Ashida Kim was killed by the mysterious White Ninja, the only ninja whiter than Radford himself.  The following video has been cited in support of this claim:
