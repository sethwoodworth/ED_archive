{{Forced Meme}}

<center>{{frame|[[Image:Hi res holeguy.jpg|500px]]|color=#cd4a08}}</center>

'''Holeguy''' is a meme that symbolizes [[buttsex|mankind's struggles from the bottom]], when they were just cavemen trying to hunt for survival to modern day when they have built successful civilizations.  From one little post in the far off year of 2009, Holeguy was being kept down by the masses of [[/b/]], only having the support of his creator, [[Faggot|Pokedude92]], and a few other guys who helped him in his epic journey to rise above the flames and sages and get bumped to the top, and ultimately to memehood.

Lol jk.  Holeguy is a forced meme that a bunch of [[n00bs]] [[No|thought would be funny to make into a meme]].  He was created and posted on /b/ some time in [[2009]] by some guy named Pokedude92 who drew a picture of a guy in a hole claiming that Holeguy is a new meme.  When he was posted, his claim of being a new meme attracted the attention of anons pretty much saying [[NO U|no you]] can't do that!  However, they forgot how to [[sage]] and the thread lasted surprisingly long.

==Holeguy Copypastas==

On July 1st, [[2009]], Holeguy was declared a meme with a [[Post ending in X]] thread. He won the thread, [[Faggotry|giving him meme status and making July 1st Holeguy Day.]]  Of course, people rly didn't like seeing him get meme status until THIS copypasta.

 Hey /b/!  Welcome to my public service announcement!  So you wanna make a [[meme]]?  Well, it's quite simple, hereâ€™s how!<br>
 *Drops beat*
 Yo wel[[come to /b/, it's a [[cool]] site
 We all love going there day and night!
 /b/ is a really really cool place,
 with memes like [[Mudkipz]], and [[Awesome|Awesome Face]]!
 We also got memes that are really dope
 like [[Numa Numa]], [[Milhouse is not a meme|Milhouse]], and [[Slowpoke]],
 [[Caramelldansen]], Holeguy and [[Longcat]],
 yep 4chan /b/ is where it's at!
 So yeah, I bet now it's your dream
 To make something that becomes a meme
 It may look hard but give it a try
 And you'll get a new meme just like Holeguy
 So first on 4chan you make a new post
 Put in a funny pic you like the most
 Then go into the comment field, the one that's penis,
 then say hey sup I got a new meme, kids!
 Tell /b/ if this post ends in 3,
 Then a new meme your pic will be!
 Do games like this and eventually
 A new meme 4chan will see!
 You wonder if it works?  Just ask my
 New favorite meme he's Holeguy
 This trick didn't work for him right away
 But with an [[epic thread]], July 1st is now Holeguy Day!<br>
 So what do you do to create a meme?
 1- Make a new thread
 2- Add a pic that you want to be a meme
 3- Do some kind of posting game like: If someone's post ends in 4 before someone else's ends <br /> in 2, X is now a meme, or if this post ends in doubles, X is now a meme.
 4- [[????]]
 5- [[Profit|PROFIT!!!]]

*NOTE: While July 1st is the official Holeguy Day, the first screencap of Holeguy getting meme status happened 29 days later.  What is particularly [[lulzy|lulz]] is that he won the meme status while keeping Milhouse from winning said meme status.

A few days later, we had THIS [[copypasta]]!

 HOLEGUY IS THE RESULT OF THE PURE MEME ESSENCE DIVIDING BY ZERO AND FORM THAT RIP IN THE SPACE TIME CONTINUUM CAME OUR BELOVED <br /> HOLEGUY.
