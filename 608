Aria Star
{{lj|user=aria_star}} is one of the {{lj|user=sf_drama}} All Stars, along with [[ladygaia87]], [[lizziey]], and many others. Aria is well-known for littering the internets with [http://community.livejournal.com/tc_snark/ drama], [http://community.livejournal.com/heartsofgold/ tl;dr posts] and   [http://community.livejournal.com/fatshionista/1153189.html?thread=19781029#t19781029 sharing too much information].

=="Personal" Life==
For someone who believes that you should [http://www.sewforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=110276&p=1010957#p1010957 "never give more info than you have to,"] Aria's personal life is very, very public.  For all but about five years of her life, [http://www.sewforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=108951&p=1008373#p1008373 she's lived in the San Francisco, California] area.  She grew up in a mixed-race, dysfunctional family. [http://community.livejournal.com/stupid_free/438471.html Her mother's family is a direct descendant of Pocahontas and a black slave], her dad committed suicide when she 23, although there has been a claim on who-knows-what that [http://shemightbe-asia.livejournal.com/56164.html she made this up] ([http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1338277.html?thread=139064997 Aria vehemently denies this]).  She has [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1338277.html?thread=139368869#t139368869 a brother] who lives in Jacksonville, whom she hasn't had contact with since her father's death and occasionally mentions a sister, [http://www.sewforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=111133&p=1019737#p1019737 Rachael aka "Roo", who is a "sister by choice."]<br>
[[Image:Aria_nipples.jpg|right|thumb|222px|What a crazy person's tits look like]]
<br>
Unsurprisingly, Aria does not have a college degree or a high school diploma. <br>
<br> 
Aria [[http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/934582.html claims that she is related]] to the [[http://www.duggarfamily.com/ Duggars]].<br>
<br>
When Aria was 17, she got engaged and planned her wedding for Feb. 14th.  But the guy got tired of her stupidity and began beating on her ass, which this batshit crazy bitch deserves.  He's a hero for doing what the rest of the world wants to do, should have just killed her.  She says she broke up with him, but he probably broke up with her.  Aria met her <strike>next prey</strike> [http://revision3.com/forum/showpost.php?p=334480&postcount=134 "fiance," Cody, online at Revision3].  Despite the fact that Cody was still officially married at the time, their courtship officially began about five months after he and his ex-wife, Randi, separated, definitely before a divorce could be final.  Cody and Aria remain [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/977780.html#cutid1 good] friends with [http://www.myspace.com/randi_24 Randi] and plan on inviting her to their wedding.<br>  This is how they will tell Randi he's dicking around with someone else.  
<br>
Cody works at an Apple store as a "Genius".  Aria is <strike>unemployed</strike>self-employed.  She spends her copious amounts of spare time trolling the internets, breeding lots of dogs, and buying dresses to sell as her own.  Another sign of her insanity is she sells them at a loss.  Not surprisingly, none of Cody's friends don't accept him marrying Aria and all of them hate her and want her to die.  I don't blame them.
<br>
If Aria didn't love the drama, she would ditch the name Aria and makea new persona.  But she keeps using her name because she knows we'll find her and the drama will start.  But it's okay, [http://community.livejournal.com/prego_drama/323712.html?thread=23453312#t23453312 she wants it and we're not going away].
<br>
<br>
<b>Wedding Planning</b><br>
After less than a year of "dating," Cody and Aria decided that they wanted to get married, though she gives the qualifier that they've been "very good friends" since 2006 and got to know each other that way.  One little teeny problem with that, though:  Cody [http://aria-star.livejournal.com/488751.html is still married].  Whoops!<br>
<br>
Aria originally wanted to get married on March 14, 2009, solely because it's "[http://www.piday.org pi day]."  However, due to IVF financial complications, they have changed the wedding date to Dec. 5, 2009.  Cody's parents are against his sham of a second wedding wedding, so they are going to DIY the majority of it.  Aria plans on <strike>stealing</strike> [http://www.sewforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=110768&p=1016400#p1016400 making her dress, her bridesmaids dresses, the flower girl dresses, and maybe Cody's tux.] <br>
<br>
<b>IVF</b><br>
Like everything else in her life, Aria is not shy [http://community.livejournal.com/pregnant/11427628.html to admit] [http://aria-star.livejournal.com/483377.html?thread=1902897#t1902897 she has fertility issues] that can most likely be attributed to her [http://aria-star.livejournal.com/490853.html extreme] [http://aria-star.livejournal.com/359896.html weight-loss] [http://aria-star.livejournal.com/485028.html techniques]*, although she claims her fertility problems are the result of a [http://www.sewforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=110489&p=1013132#p1013132 car accident when she was 18].  But her [http://community.livejournal.com/bad_service/1727068.html "bad service" post does not mention a miscarriage at all!]  Aria is too selfish to just adopt so she has resorted to the idea of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilization In Vitro Fertilization].  <br>
*[http://community.livejournal.com/ed_progresspics/157793.html Anorexia.]  She has admitted to [http://community.livejournal.com/inbetweenies/27267.html "popping ephedra like it's candy.  Six capsules each with 250mg of ephedrine extract...I can tolerate up to about nine of these per day."] <br>
<br>
Despite her desperate desires to get pregnant, Cody and Aria do not have the money to get IVF.  Therefore, she has started an [http://www.ourwishingwell.com/webpages/view/551/Aria%20and%20Cody's%20In%20Vitro%20Fertilization%20Fund IVF fund] that [http://www.ourwishingwell.com/webpages/view/552/Gift%20Registry anyone can contribute] to in order to [http://revision3.com/forum/showthread.php?t=17569 make her dream of squatting out a child come true].  [http://revision3.com/forum/showthread.php?t=17569 She pimps out this IVF wishing fund] just like she'll pimp out her crotch-dropping one day.  Her fiance's health care plan has recently made IVF more financially feasible.  The jury is still out on whether a doctor will actually let her pro-create, though Aria [http://www.sewforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=110768&p=1016400#p1016400 managed to start IVF treatments in January 2009].  She has already [http://www.sewforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=110203&p=1009695#p1009695 picked her children's names:]<br>
<i>Girl names:</i> Charlotte Rose, Elizabeth Lily, Veronica Violet<br>
<i>Boy names:</i>  Kevin Joel Alexander (to be called Lex), Logan Norrin Xavier.<br>
"Girls would be named in that order. A boy would get which name felt right. We do NOT plan to have five though!!"

You can read the latest on her IVF journey, including [http://theclementsbabies.wordpress.com/2008/08/16/i-just-need-to-blow-off-some-steam her defense against the meanie heads who want her to adopt], in her [http://theclementsbabies.wordpress.com IVF blog].  Maybe one day she'll get it that if they don't have enough money to have in vitro, they can't afford to raise a kid.  In vitro is only $15,000, but raising a crotch-loaf is over $200,000.

If there's a merciful god, any crotchtrot she shits out will die while she's holding it so her heart will die along with her will to force her genetic material on the world.

As of December 5, 2009, Aria "gave birth" to a daughter, Charlotte Rose Clements, on December 3rd. According to her wordpress blog, the birth was "traumatic". Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure it was.  Made-up events aren't traumatic.

As of March 25, 2010, she's been stealing pictures of a baby to claim as her own for months.  Pictures of her with a baby are her with a realistic "reborn" doll she scammed from Tracy Arnold of [http://www.moviegowns.com Moviegowns].  What a surprise.  A human she says she made s a doll made by Tracy.

Oddly enough, her "daughter" has a [http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?v=wall&id=100000721540704 profile on Facebook] and seems to be quite good at the insipid flash game called Farmville.

=="Professional" Life==
<b>Backyard Breeding:</b><br>
A "backyard breeder" is that person who has a multitude of dogs/cats/guinea pigs/jennets/frogs/etc. because they have not gotten it through their head that the male animal and the female animal will keep having [[Buttsecks|sex]] over and over again and this sex will end in a litter of [[Mudkips|critters]], until you get them spayed and neutered.<br>
Aria? She doesn't quite get that either. 
<br>
<br>
Aria chronicles her backyard breeding in {{lj|user=emmaspuppies}}.  She claims she's a [http://www.sewforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=108995&p=1009231#p1009231 responsible breeder], although many argue that breeding at all isn't responsible at all because it adds to the over-population of animals and means that abandoned animals in shelters will not be adopted.
<br>
<br>
<b>"Designing" Dresses:</b><br>
Aria allegedly [http://ariaaustin.com designs and creates custom, "couture" dresses].  According to Aria's website, she creates [http://www.ariaaustin.com/historical.html historical]and film dresses like from [http://www.ariaaustin.com/titanic.html Titanic] or [http://www.ariaaustin.com/lordoftherings.html Lord of the Rings].  She is [http://www.sewforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=110076&p=1020596&hilit=%2Aaria#p1020596 currently expanding into the bridal market].  But she really doesn't even own a single sewing machine or pair of sewing scissors.  She has [http://www.ariaaustin.com/aboutaria.html posted pictures] of a random sewing room.  Why isn't she in the pictures if it's her room?  right-click-save those pictures.  She'll post pictures of a new sewing room soon when she gets bored of those pictures. 

Depending on the post, she either claims she's been sewing for other people for "[http://www.sewforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=110511&p=1024500#p1024500 almost 9 years"] or that [http://www.sewforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=110078&p=1010971#p1010971 she's been sewing since she was 3 years old.]   Apparently, a benefit of her sewing at such a young age means that [http://www.sewforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=110078 she "recognized the benefit to paying attention to math in school, specifically geometry" and by the time she was 16, she stopped using patterns].<br>
<br>
Aria's different personalities:<br>
<br>
<i>Victoria</i><br>
As Victoria, Aria made <s>http://victoriarosedesigns.com</s> (lol baleeted) where people would order dresses based on the pictures they saw. All the Titanic costumes were made by other people and she was lying and claiming she made them. Then when people would order items from her many [http://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&ftab=AllFeedback&userid=poohnut55&iid=-1&de=off&items=25&page=1 ebay accounts], she would either send items she bought from real dressmakers at higher prices, or send crap items she bought at Goodwill.  One anonymous woman claims she was sent a blood-stained garment. She had an LJ at that time, ms_erie, which has since been renamed as {{lj|user=aria_star}}.<br>
<br>
<i>Victoria Rose</i><br>
When her first site got busted, she created VictoriaRoseDesigns. She claimed to be the almost-step-mother of a kid who was molested by the real mom's family and said she named this web site after the crotch dropping to get people to feel bad and want to buy from her.<br>
<br>
<i>Charlotte Chastain</i><br>
After Aria was exposed, she brought in Charlotte. Charlotte Chastain created http://eleganteras.com (dead, but you can [http://web.archive.org/web/2003040213481/www.eleganterasdesigns.bravepages.com/index.html see the archive here]) and http://ladycynthia.com  (dead) and http://geocities.com/amomentofmagic (which is now a site about exposing her for fraud).

<i>Elizabeth Allen</i><br>
She also defrauds people in The Lord of the Rings costuming circle with the screenname [http://bookcrossing.com/mybookshelf/Arareiel Araeiel] or Arareiel.<br>
<br>
Other identities of hers are monnonsharp, LadyArareiel, ajadoniz, siliconvalleygirlgeek, lemonchiffon and lemonchiffon1912.   Rumor has it that her name was Misti and then she legally changed it to Aria, but she also years ago claimed to be [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tasteless.jokes/browse_thread/thread/89b2d99d04a8fa42/054c729d3b359bd4?lnk=gst&q=misti14325+jeff%27s+#054c729d4b359bd4 an ex-boyfriend's slut], and Misti is a common porn name.

==LJ Drama==
Aria has an immense presence on Livejournal.  Not everyone wants her there.  A lot of people wish she would die already.  She's widely known to join communities only to  [http://community.livejournal.com/stupidpetowners/2846147.html create drama] and make judgmental comments[1], while also telling random snippets of personal information that nobody wants to hear.  Then when people respond, she [http://sayonara-snot.livejournal.com/17594.html?thread=154042#t154042 plays] [http://classiclindsey.livejournal.com/29826.html?thread=104322#t104322 victim], stomps her feet and [http://pics.livejournal.com/futuremrs/pic/00002r81 threatens LJAbuse] when she doesn't get her way.<br>
<br>
In 2006 Aria joined {{lj|user=sextips}}.  She posts about her then-boyfriend having erectile issues, and a commenter suggests perhaps he's getting action from another source.  She promptly deletes the comment.  After a warning for deleting the comment and two off topic posts, she is banned from the community.  She posts to {{lj|user=st_discussion}} arguing that deleting a comment should not lead to a warning.  Her replies to the mods include such gems as "Please, please don't have kids. We don't need more people in this world who think an apology is a reason to kick someone out because it's not up to your standards. An attempt that is imperfect is better than not attempt at all." and "Burn in hell!"  This led to her permanent ban from both {{lj|user=sextips}} and {{lj|user=st_discussion}}.<br>
<br>
When Aria decided to get engaged, she joined many wedding planning communities, including {{lj|user=weddingplans}}.  She was quickly banned from {{lj|user=weddingplans}} after [http://community.livejournal.com/weddingplans/14474377.html?thread=202285961#t202285961 being disrespectful] to members who had different opinions about weddings being for presents repeatedly.  She felt that she was unjustly banned, so she created a [http://apuppetmistress.livejournal.com sockpuppet account] account to infiltrate {{lj|user=weddingplans}} and {{lj|user=cf_hardcore}} (another community from which Aria was banned).  Aria, [http://pics.livejournal.com/futuremrs/pic/0000f1ba assuming the name of "Stasia,"] probably from [http://digg.com/users/AriaStar one of her middle names], Ana<u>stasia</u>, messaged one of the mods of WP to explain that she is NOT a sockpuppet.  However, she got caught by providing posting about controversial topics in order to rile people up.  She was banned again and reported to LJ Abuse for ban evasion.<br>
<br>
Communities she's banned from: {{lj|user=sf_drama}} ([http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1489144.html#comments for deleting a post]), {{lj|user=sextips}}, {{lj|user=st_discussion}}, {{lj|user=weddingplans}}, {{lj|user=fatshionista}} {{lj|user=fertilityissues}}, {{lj|user=childfree}}, and {{lj|user=cf_hardcore}}.  It's only a matter of time before she's banned from many other communities.  {{lj|user=stupid_free}} has an entire [http://community.livejournal.com/stupid_free/tag/aria_star tag] devoted to Aria wank.  {{lj|user=sf_drama}} also has an [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/tag/aria_star entire tag] of Aria wank, as well.
<br>
Because she's been banned from so many communities, she decided to start her own: 
Wedding communities Aria has created: {{lj|user=weddinggowns}}, {{lj|user=realistic_bride}}, {{lj|user=realisticbrides}}, {{lj|user=bridalplans}}, and {{lj|user=bridalsnark}}.
Fertility/Baby communities Aria has created:  {{lj|user=august09}}, {{lj|user=august09babies}}, {{lj|user=august09baby}}, {{lj|user=august2009}}, {{lj|user=august2009baby}}, {{lj|user=dueaugust2009}}, {{lj|user=dueinaugust09}}, {{lj|user=september2009}}, {{lj|user=september09baby}}, {{lj|user=ivfparents}} and {{lj|user=babydueaugust09}}.

This is FALSE.  While she was allowed to create a new account on LiveJournal, if she evades a community ban for a third time, she will be permanently suspended from LiveJournal.<br>

<b> On March 17th, 2009, [http://pics.livejournal.com/lizzie9208/pic/001896 Aria was permanently suspended from LiveJournal] due to [http://pics.livejournal.com/lizzie9208/pic/00188 ban evasion] in {{lj|user=weddingplans}}!</b>  Her most recent LJ account, {{lj|user=my_lady_aria}}, along with {{lj|user=bride_elle}},  {{lj|user=boundforcanada}}, {{lj|user=emmaspuppies}}, {{lj|user=clementswedding}} and a multitude of baby communities she created, were suspended.  Per LiveJournal's Abuse Policy, she is permanently suspended and is forever forbidden from creating new LiveJournal users and communities.  Good riddance!

==The Moar You Know==
[[Image:videogame.gif|left|thumb|350px|Aria: You lose]] {{lj|user=coreyann}} and {{lj|user=guinastasia}} have both said they had proof of theft and blood specifically from fingerpricks on gowns Aria did make.  When called out on how they knew blood was from finger-pricking or even pictures, both of them claimed they've "moved on" and deleted from their computers any proof.  To date, no proof has been presented and no pictures have surfaced of blood on gowns and no other online seamstress has had any pictures of dresses Aria's claimed to have made.  All the allegations to date have been by people who say an unnamed friend or a friend of a friend was ripped off or got a damaged gown.  coreyann and guinastasia are friends of the seamstress who is Aria's #1 hater and enemy, Tracy.  Tracy benefits when Aria isn't around.  Is this all wank that started around two rival dressmakers, and everyshit taken out of context since then?  It's a lot of fun, no matter how it goes.<br><br>
{{lj|user=guinastasia}} is also showing herself to be a stalker. In a new post, she [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1565771.html claims] Aria [http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=26029125479 bought a gown] she's claiming as [http://www.ariaaustin.com/lordoftheringsarwen.html her own], though [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1565771.html?thread=174180171#t174180171 several other members] of the community [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1565771.html?thread=174200139#t174200139 point out] [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1565771.html?thread=174244939#t174244939 the many] [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1565771.html?thread=174256971#t174256971 differences], even pointing out that [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1565771.html?thread=174194251#t174194251 she wouldn't be doing her job if the gown was similar] and asking "[http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1565771.html?thread=174248267#t174248267 Okay, isn't a little creepy to be... constantly checking on these things?]" {{lj|user=qweerdo}} replies by saying someone has to, which is almost an admission of stalking.  {{lj|user=porcupine8}} said that Aria was "[http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1565771.html?thread=174258251#t174258251 inviting direct comparisons]" by admitting she based her version off of one by Museum Replicas.  {{lj|user=qweerdo}} goes back to the "but she's done it before!" claim again without giving evidence or names or pictures, just a he-said-she-said.  The worst place for him to try this is in a thread where most people are siding with the person they actually hate.  When {{lj|user=guinstasia}} begins to reply, she makes a couple [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1565771.html?thread=174248267#t174248267 very vague references] to "friends" who were scammed (but who, curiously, never speak for themselves and are never named), admits she's "[http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1565771.html?thread=174670923#t174670923 probably agree]" that the dresses are different if it weren't for "history," and said, in reply to the many people who disagree with her and again vaguely referencing "friends'", "[http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1565771.html?thread=174675531#t174675531 I know it's lame, guys, but I'm just pissed off on behalf of my friends who were scammed by her in the past. That and I'm having a shitty week and she's an easy target to take it out on.]"  If those "friends" aren't pissed off enough to be named or come forward, then why is ''she'' so fixated on revenge of Aria?<br><br>
{{lj|user=mauselynn}}, in [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1338277.html?thread=173470885#t173470885 another post], said, "What I was going to say, in her defense, is that I have not seen any of the other seamstresses she been accused of stealing from yet. I have several friends who sew, watch out for such things, and it has never been mentioned." <br><br>
It's looking more like a small group of friends has it out for one seamstress and will stop at nothing to destroy her reputation.  Outside of one admittedly large group ({{lj|user=sf_drama}}, current home of the anti-Aria brigade, has over 5,000 drama-loving members which means a very far reach and a presence on almost every forum and bulletin board on the internet), her reputation is clean.  This is epic war.

Also, the above was written by aria_star herself because she just can't let things go.  The Internet says let it be so.  And so it was so.
