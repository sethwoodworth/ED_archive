BSD
BSD, the '''Berkley Software Distribution''' is a dead, historical operating system. It was an early attempt at copying [[Linux]] but the 40 Ã¼ber codemonkeys who maintain it, forgot to add semicolons and thus BSD has been dying now for about 10 years, ironically as long as all of the BSD servers have been running without a reboot. No one is really sure why it's still around. It's such shit that they are [[BSD License|giving it out for free]].

Like all [[UNIX]] systems, BSD is flamboyantly [[gay]] at its core; unlike the [[Not gay|self-deluded closeted homosexuals]] of the [[Linux]] community, however, BSD users freely admit their love of [[Samwell|buttsecks]] and their plans to [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274518/ make way for an entirely-homosexual society].

{{quote|As compatible as McKusick and Allman seem now, it was hardly love at first byte. Back at Berkeley in 1976, when Allman first tried to interface with McKusick about a date, McKusick's closeted response included a menacing look. Three years later McKusick finally scrounged up the courage to cope with his sexuality by attending a gay rap session at Berkeley and found shaggy-haired Allman tossing smug "I knew it" grins from across the semicircle. They bonded over a lengthy chat about computers later that evening and began building a relationship in which each would stake a claim for a piece of cyberspace history.}}

==FreeBSD==

[[Image:Netbsd.jpg|thumb|[[weev]] using an intelligent, logically conclusive monologue to convey the advantages of NetBSD to FreeBSD advocates]]

Like all BSDs a parody of [[UNIX]]. The least notable part of this [[operating system]] is the fact that many FreeBSD developers frequent [[encyclopediadramatica|ED]] and/or [[insub]] and create plenty of drama and [[lulz]] for all of the [[Internets]] to enjoy. Anyone who uses BSD is never going to get laid. This is a fact.

Developers of note include [[flata]], [[Darren Reed]], [[Zb]], [[Cameron Grant]], and [[Girlvinyl]]. Non-developers of note include [[Stevie Wonder]], Helen Keller and [[Ray Charles]].  No new developers are allowed on the team unless they have some sort of personality disorder.

In a surprise decision, on October 5, 2005 the FreeBSD project decided that blind, lynx, and [[hiptop]] users would no longer be allowed to use FreeBSD. This was accomplished by altering their [[website]] to cripple any [[browser]] or screenreader that didn't comply with the [[W3C]]'s rigorous "Best viewed with [[Internet Explorer]] (more like Internet Exploder, amirite?) at 800x600" standard. At a press conference, when asked to comment on the sudden cutoff of blind uses, a spokesman said only "lol [[retarded|tards]]".

==NetBSD==

[http://www.netbsd.org/ NetBSD] is the BSD known for once having the most homoerotic [http://www.netbsd.org/gallery/logos.html logo], and now having the most pukingly [[politically correct]] one.  It also comes in Wasabi flavour. This can run on any plaform, even the horribly plauged crapples.

==OpenBSD==

[http://www.openbsd.org/ OpenBSD] is a BSD based UNIX-like operating system created by the [[nerd]] [[Theo de Raadt]], with [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/15/openbsd_backdoor_claim/ cryptographic 'assistance' from the FBI].  [[Hacker]] [[Drama]] seems to follow this operating system especially when remote exploits are found in OpenSSH. This operating system is so secure that it cannot even be used as a server.

==[[Mac OS X]]==
An operating system made for people who want to be trendy. It has a loyal following that never goes away, similar to [[herpes]]. These people get to together every six months for conventions where they imitate the [[furry]] pile. [[Bantown]] is infested with these faggots.

==DragonflyBSD==

Like FreeBSD, but with some shiny new toys that only the most [[1337]] of [[geek]]s could ever appreciate.  Nothing to see here. Also very useful if you like pkg_add errors.

The DragonFly project is a fork of FreeBSD 4.10, created by Matthew Dillon in an attempt to reinvent the [[Amiga]].  This is doomed to failure as Dillon did so with insufficient drama and he is not a big enough [[Theo_de_Raadt|asshole]] to ensure success of yet another BSD fork.

==PC BSD==

BSD doing its best [[Red Hat]] imitation but not doing a good enough job.  PC BSD is like the [[nerd]] who shows up to the prom with an imaginary girlfriend.

==DeadBSD==

We made this one up, sorry.

==HawkinsOS==

An imaginary BSD thought up by a [[slashdot]] [[troll]] who had a sudden [http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=9262 crisis of identity] on OSnews.  [[Lulz]] ensued.


== NaziBSD ==
[[Image:NaziBSD.jpg|thumb|a typical NaziBSD user.]]
A BSD distro used by [http://darkn3ss.evilmag.com/images/pics/ Nazi's]. NaziBSD is similair to FreeBSD but is unique in that it has no alt-tab feature to hide [[Porn]], because FreeBSD does not support the more popular browsers, such as blind, lynx, and [[hiptop]]. NaziBSD has made use of the popular form of communication, the internets, to host images of their users shoulders. This is to attract [[4chan]] users and [[bears]] to their daughters, as to allow their species to continue existance.

==Furries and BSD==

Furries currently do not differentiate between BSD's in [http://captainpackrat.com/furry/furcode.htm#Human-Computers FurCode] (as of version 1.3).
As of version 2.0, approxamently 4000 satanists run FreeBSD, though we all know these are Lunix carpet munchers infesting BSD with crabs which makes many of them more [[furry]].  6000 other users are simply clueless ports maintainers who are open to the possibility of furry activity with other free and broken operating system users, such as those from FurryBSD and the BrokenSolaris [[Nevada]] project, both of which consist of large cactus needles

However, most BSD users completely fucking resent furries and just like everyone else, they sneak in and slowly corrode at the operating system. Soon enough, BSD users might be seeing a [[lolwut|fox fucking a chicken]] as their startup image every day.
