''Not to be confused with [[Uncyclopedia]], which has 28% moar [[fail]].''
[[Image:Fail Logo.png|thumb|Truth in advertising.]]
'''Failcyclopedia''' is exactly that, a wiki of fail. Run by a [[User:Crim2|former ED user]] ([[TGcomix]]) who got banned for making shitty articles that reeked of butthurt and [[personal army]] requests. After being banned infinitely on ED for being one of the hugest faggots on the internet, he took his articles and started his own wiki. It is painfully obvious that he wants his wiki to be another [[ED]], but the main difference is that [[ED]] is original and groundbreaking and Failcyclopedia is [[Crap sandwich|made of fail and AIDS]].

The lulziest part of Failcyclopedia's butthurt nature is that the main Sysop took the username of the [[Zaiger420|ED Sysop]] who banned him, obviously hoping that if people saw an ED Sysop working on their wiki they would believe that [[Fail]]cyclopedia is [[awesome]] like [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. Which it isn't.

==Editing Failcyclopedia==
===Quotes===
{{squote|  So why are we here?<br>
<br/>
[[Lie|Well, basically we've here to assrape Encyclopedia Dramatica. ED claims that we buttfucked all of their content to fill our pages (much as they buttfucked Wikipedia for theirs), but this claim is proven false by the fact that our site is actually funny. While ED habitually scans the web for gay porn and other sick fuck crap (see: Goatse), we scour the intertubes looking for lulz. As ED's admin are totally devoid of human intelligence, the concept of humor is totally lost on them, which is why their entire content revolves around anal penetration and Mexican Donkey shows (see: Girlvynl). There really is no common ground for comparison: Failcyc is epic win; ED is concentrated pig shit. Some argue nothing, because this is the plain truth. End of story, don't bother deleting the page, fgt.]]|From Failcyclopedia's [[Unwarranted Self Importance|article on themselves]]}}

===Random Page Game===
A fun game to play on Failcyclopedia since eBaum's perpetrated its last vandalbot attack is the '''Random Page Game'''. This is where you go to Failcyclopedia and press the [http://www.failcyclopedia.com/index.php/Special:Random Random Page Button]. See how many times you can hit the button before you get to an actual unvandalized article. It is hours of [[lulz|fun]]!!!

===How to create an article===
#Copy and paste from ED.
#If you actually do write your own material, be sure to pipe every other word with either [[faggot]], [[bullshit]], or [[fail]].
#Congratulations! You have written your first Failcyclopedia article!

===Vandalizing Failcyclopedia===
Vandalizing Failcyclopedia is like shooting children in a barrel, considering the main Sysop, [[User:Crim2|Zaiger420]] (Not the same as [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]'s own [[Zaiger420]]) is only active for an hour or so a day, and he is the only contributor to the site.

Vandalbots are very effective against this site, since you can leave it running for hours before being found, but if you do not have access to one a normal account will do just fine. Make sure to create pages telling the fake Zaiger420 that he is a butthurt fag, he will subsequently lock your new page and change the wording to try to make himself look better.

{{bigpic|Fail RC Vandalism.png|frame|310|A mere fraction of Failcyclopedia's RC vandalism.}}

===Trolling Failcyclopedia===
Trolling Failcyclopedia is easy. For example, here's a letter that was written by Failcyclopedia User:[[Truth]] to the site owner, Carbide20.

{{cs2|Fail1|The letter|

{{squote|Dear Carbide20:
Good fucking lord. Where do I begin. Lets start with the site as a whole. The layout is messy but that is the least of your worries.

The major problem is that you essentialy took encyclopedia dramatica (You even reffered to an ED meme while talking shit about it, now thats stupid!) and dumbed it own passed uncyclopedia levels. There is no demand for another lulz-based reporting service. None. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Your massive steaming pile of wobat excretion is furthur vilified by the fact that you seem to be, above all oher things: a newfag. You have no credible sense of humor, you reuse memes to fuel a pointless website, while dissing the very chan you stole it from. I'm going to take a wild stab at your history and peice together something that will (Frighteningly) probably not be far off. Here goes:You found 4chan either through the infamous Digg that ruined /b/ or did so after the contamination was complete. You laughed at every U RAFF U RUSE thread, you particpated in the GET IN HEREs everytime and essentially made your way just like almost every other faggot still scrabbling for a bit of non-existant lulz on that godforsaken stretch of cursed HTML. When the oldfags boarded the last train to other chans sometime early 08, your newfag orgasm hit full spurt. In fact, the only thing that seperates you from the rest of the infantile cocksucks that populate that site is this: On your 14eenth birthday your parents started giving you an allowance. You saved up this money and invested in this waste of bandwidth that now slobers before the collective community of Anonymous. You always considered Anonymous, deep down, to be an ultra-cool band of cyber hooligans that you were a member of. TL;DR: You didn't fucking get it then and you sure as fuck don't now. And the reason I erased a page to do this? Your fucking mail system is broken, you sloppy ass bandit you. In the old days a raid would be called and this whole thing would be bombed into E-dust. Oh well. Times change. The reason I wrote this? I thought someone should really take at least five minutes out of their day to tell you this, futile though it may be. My advice? Close the site, lurk moar on a chan that counts like 7-chan, 420chan, 711chan, or even 99chan. Use the money to buy a bong and smoke moar. Toodles.|Failcyclopedia User:Truth}}

[[Image:Failcyc vandalism.PNG|thumb|Coincidently, Failcyclopedia Sysop's face looked exactly the same once he saw what happened to his wiki.]]

{{squote|Sweet brah, thnx sincerely for the time out of ur important life to tell me all this. I guess there is no need for a site like this that gets all this traffic and has all these cool members. You're right. I should probably just delete it now cuz I certainly value your opinion more than all the people who like this site. lulz.

Oh, and yea the point of this site is to document the memes of the interwebz. This obviously means writing about ED and 4chan, no matter how much we love to lulz @ them. People over there lulz @ us and still write all about failcyc.

Ah, and I'm actually not really a big fan of *chans of any sort. If I wanted to see gay porn I would start at step 1: becoming gay.

the mail system works just fine. clearly u just fail @ life.

Next time you feel like blaming someone for the existence of a website, try not doing it on a [[butthurt|GODDAMN MOTHER FUCKIN WIKI]]!!! what are you, an idiot?!?!?! ITS A WIKI!!!!
as in, people other than me do the majority of everything on the site...

anywhoo, this site has been up for about a month and has hundreds of articles, [[fat|tons of members]], made lots $$ and has [[bullshit|pro content]]. Clearly that means that the site is failing if we use your logic.

now, plz do us all a favor and GET THE FUCK OFF OUR INTERWEBZ before you get hurt. [[irony|It is not safe for noobz]].|Carbide20}}

==The Death Of Failcyclopedia==
On June 24th, 2009, members of [[Ebaumsworld]] got ahold of [[at least 100]] [[Fail]]cyclopedia [[Sysop]] accounts. These accounts were then used to ban all of the real Sysops on the site, before being used to unlock all of the sites protected articles, including the front page. The accounts were then loaded into a vandalbot program which was run for 6-7 hours, blanking pages, moving pages and replacing text on pages. Finally every article on the site was [[baleeted|flushed]] and every page was replaced with a giant [[Dancing Sandwich]] and [[Rainbow Blinkies]]. After realizing that the site was, as quoted on this articles talkpage, "[[rape|lying on the ground, bleeding from the colon, crying, in a pool of blood and semen]]", the site owner conceded that Failcyclopedia is in fact not the bad ass [[ED]] ass raping wiki that it claims to be, by redirecting the [[URL]] to [[Demotivator|Motivationals.org]], a website that he also owns.

==NEW! HATELINE WIKI==
[[Image:Hateline.PNG|thumb|300px|Hateline's main page.]]
After the [[ruination]] of Failcyclopedia, Crim2 created Hateline Wiki on [[Wikia]] - a successor to Failcyclopedia.
{{quote|[[butthurt|Been trolled by some FAGGOT? ]]

[[butthurt|Been BANNED by some CUNT? ]]

[[butthurt|WANT REVENGE?? ]]

'''[[You win the prize|WELL, THIS IS THE SITE FOR YOU!!1!''']]|Welcome to Hateline Wiki}}

Apparently Failcyclopedia's [[unfunny]] [[attack]] pages were a part of the Master Plan - [[Lie{{!}}Crim had always intended to make it a haters' wiki]]. [[User:Zaiger/Zaiger420 (ED) Failcyclopedia article{{!}}'''Here's''']] a copy of the article about [[Zaiger]].

[[Lulz|The wiki was swiftly closed by Wikia]].

==Hateline Wiki 2: [[Electric boogaloo]]==
''Not to be confused with [[Uncyclopedia]], which has 28% less [[fail]].''

{{notice|The new Hateline wiki has no login, therefore [[pussy|other users cannot edit it]]. This makes Hateline less of a wiki and more of [[livejournal|a public diary filled with bitching and butthurt]].}}
[[Image:HatelineHome.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Gays are below pedophiles in the Hateline order.]]

Following his [[TGcomix#Other_phun_phactz|inevitable expulsion from DeviantART Wiki]], Crim ported all of his shitty attack articles over to [[Google Sites]], giving Hateline [[cancer|a matter of days]] before some [[teen mommy|concerned mother]] stumbles on it and [[flag|"reverts it with the touch of a button"]]. Billing itself as "Failcyc's thematic successor", Hateline states its mission objective as follows:

{{quote|That's right - we're <u>back</u>, you bleeding cunts. '''HATELINE WIKI''' has returned to '''Spread The Truth''' and '''assfuck''' the '''internet's biggest faggots''' into submission.}}

Despite a [[fail|massive spamming campaign]] targeting ''three different boards'', Hateline has received [[shit nobody cares about|zero interest]] due to its appalling quality (considered worse than [[Uncyclopedia]], if such a thing is physically possible). The content? Cartoon children with [[lolwut|silicon implants]], men's assholes, and a smattering of [[unfunny]] articles which were flushed from ED. [[TL;DR|Aforementioned]] articles are supposed to be funny, yet always center around entities which have wronged His Holiness. Maybe mentioning his [[babyfuck|games simulating child rape]] was a little too truth for him. This neither stops Hateline from obsessively speculating about the sexual [[clit|proclivity]] of others nor, regrettably, sharing said [[divide by zero|thoughts]] which are incomplete without violent gay pornography. This is included.

In his defense, complex concepts like "truth" and "humor" may not be compatible with "giving children breast implants makes them adults," "[[mental illness|I am three different people]]," and "serial rapists deserve jobs as pantie inspectors and Japanese child fuck dolls financed by [[you|yours truly]]."

===Rules===
[[File:Hateline wiki rules.PNG|thumb|230px|And [[you]] thought we were making this up.]]

*[[Racism]] and [[homophobia]] are forbidden - unless you are a member of a racial or sexual minority. Making fun of [[white people]] is not only acceptable but encouraged. Using the word "[[faggot]]" is [[a cat is fine too|fine too]].
*[[Loli]], [[shota]] and other underage anime characters being spanked are allowed BUT NO [[CP]]! The cartoon [[why is there an article?|child being raped]] on the front page is neither [[blind|child nor pornographic]]. Also, the photograph of a [http://i50.tinypic.com/2h7321s.jpg child being raped] on the [http://sites.google.com/site/dlwysf/project-definition FAQ page] is totally legal.
*Accusing people of criminal activities results in a ban. In the [[North Korea|Hateline utopia]], "kiddie diddling" is legal. Actually, that sounds about right.
*[[Mods]] are allowed to do as they wish and may break all the above rules.
