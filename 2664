An '''engineer''' is a [[Basement dweller|basement dwelling]] [[nerd]] professionally [[secks|engaged]] in the use [[math]] and [[science]] for the [[lie|purpose]] of designing [[User:Jbs|useless]] [[crap]]. Engineers are concerned with making the most possible [[Money|jewgold]] [[Truth|while avoiding the solutions to any practical problems]]. [[Lie|Engineers play a vital role in society]], [[Darwin Award|culling the populace]] through [[lulz|negligent design flaws]] in items such as [[Minneapolis Bridge Collapse|bridges]], buildings, [[Team Fortress 2|Sentries, Dispensers, Teleporters]] and cars.

==Manufacture==

Engineers are generally formed when [[nerd]]s first enter [[college]] and find out that [[4chan]] is not an available major. Engineering school consist of a [[Asian|lifetime worth of math]], science and [[Chemistry|other useless crap]] packed into four years. The required math homework [[Fat|precludes all physical activity]], causing massive muscle atrophy. Unlike [[you|everyone else]], engineers have no time to [[secks|get laid]] in college and end up spending all their time trying not to [[fail]] at [[Science|Applied Mechanics 1402]].

Once out of [[college]], engineers become certified by the [[NAMBLA]] and can begin careers designing items as diverse as dildos and [[Apple]] computers.

==Variants==

===Electrical===
Electrical engineers design items such as [[4chan|servers]], the [[Playstation 3|PS3]], [[Fire|your toaster]] and [[BDSM|electro-genital stimulators]]. [[Geek|They]] tend to be the nerdiest of all [[Dick|flavors]] of engineer, spending all their time on the [[G|/g/]] board of [[4chan]], [[Masturbation|fapping]] to pictures of [[Science|2N3055]] transistors. Work generally consists of useless crap that any electrician could figure out, such as fixing the [[Moot|power supply]] on [[4chan]]â€™s server, designing a [[Navy|missile guidance]] system or figuring out how to [[Win|kill a furry with a 9V battery]].

===Mechanical===
Mechanical engineers sit around all day bitching about how <strike>robots have made their job obsolete</strike> spies have been sappin' their sentries. [[Some argue]] mechanical engineers are [[Lie|still useful]] for designing lawn mowers ,toasters, tv antennes, and reclining chairs. Mechanical engineers designed [[Fag|your prosthetic penis]].

===Chemical===
Chemical engineers the [[Secks|link]] between [[Chemistry|chemists]] and [[Cancer|products]], finding ways of adding [[Cancer|highly carcinogenic]] [[Cancer|chemicals]] to [[Cancer|every day products]] such as [[Cancer|baby formula]] and [[Cancer|personal lubricant]]. It's a well known fact that all chemical engineers cook [[meth]] and [[Anarchy|make bombs]] in their spare time.

===Polymer Engineer===
Polymer engineers are a [[Retard|special]] [[Gay|flavor]] of chemical engineer. Polymer engineers generally try to destory the [[Furry|environment]] as fast as possible, while attempting to turn [[You|horse shit]] into plastic. Polymer engineers designed [[you]]r latex suit, [[you]] [[sick fuck]].

===Civil===
Civil engineers design [[Minneapolis Bridge Collapse|faulty bridges]] with the intent of [[Darwin Award|killing as many people as possible]], [[Did it for the lulz|for the lulz]]. The [[Minneapolis Bridge Collapse|Minneapolis Bridge Collapse]] is considered to be the [[Penis|peak]] of civil engineering throughout [[Fail|history]], establishing a [[Win|high score]] of 13 for future generations to [[Masturbate|beat]]. It has been said that human sexuality was designed by a civil engineer - who else would be stupid enough to put a sewage plant right next the carnival?<br clear=all>

===Nuclear===
Nuclear engineers collect uranium for [[iran|that sandnigger guy]], in an attept to [[borat|blow up the great jew]] and cause general middle-eastern lulz. [[Lie|Nuclear engineers are among the smartest]], [http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/plutonium.html having figured out a fool proof way of storing plutonium dust in file cabinets].

===Industrial===
Industrial engineers walk around and tell [[you|people]] that they are [[doing it wrong]] because they are [[butthurt]] about being life long virgins.  They live to eat [[shit|muda]] because its the only way they can get off.  They didn't create the interwebs, they just made it [[gay]].

===Software===
Software engineers, distinct from [[programmer|programmers]], believe that [[Lie|there is more to programming than just writing]] [[code]]. They are obsessed with things called [[Shit nobody cares about|processes]] instead of [[lazy|doing actual work]]. Further, software engineers produce [[shit|software]], which means that they are automatically deserving of [[slashfic|pain]] and [[rape|suffering]]. [[Some argue|It has been said]] that both software engineers and programmers are working in collusion to spread their [[AIDS|suffering]] worldwide, in an attempt to [[All your base are belong to us|take over the world]].
