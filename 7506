'''Sigurd Hosenfeld''' (also known as ''HosenFAILED'', ''Peachsnogger'', and <s>Peachfucker</s> ''Peachmongler''), is a [[Denmark|Danish]] TARTlet who enjoys pretending he's a different, more talented artist and has a raging [[erection|hard-on]] for Nintendo's very own Princess Peach, a vapid pixelated [[slut|blond]] who can't seem to stop getting kidnapped and [[rape]]d by a mutant spiky turtle. That, and people see fit to lavish him with praise and fanart for this, ensuring his place as a "[[DevianTART#The_Popular_Ass_.28Popularium_Asinus.29|Popular Ass]]" on deviantART.

==Modus Operandi==

[[Image:Peachsnoggerwtf.jpg|frame|left|[http://sigurdhosenfeld.deviantart.com/journal/5001274/ At least he admits it's insane]...]]

Sigurd proudly proclaims on his deviantART page (and any other chance he gets) that he is "[[pedophile|Princess Peach's Lover]]", and has replaced the [[fat|lardass]], hairy and smelly [[Mario|Italian plumber]] who rescues the dumb bimbo's [[ass]] all the time with himself as her love interest in every single pic he uploads to deviantART. It's also the subject of every single art trade he participates in and every single piece of art he commissions. If he isn't asking someone to draw a picture of himself with a video game character, other TARTlets (some who are better artists than he is) also willingly draw fanart of him and Peach making out or getting married, for free, not seeming to realize the obvious [[batshit|batshit crazy]] that he is in love with a '''[[video game|VIDEO GAME]] CHARACTER.'''

[[Image:Heaven_in_her_bed_by_SigurdHosenfeld.jpg|thumb|An example of [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/54183391/ his pure and innocent art] to match his pure and innocent love for Peach.]]

Of course, this is probably completely [[WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY|normal and socially acceptable behavior]] to most TARTlets. Just look at [[sephirothslave]] and [[Snapesnogger]].

Sigurd has never uploaded a single photo of himself to deviantART, instead opting to always [[mary sue|draw himself]] as a tall, waifish, blond [[fag|supah Aryan man]]. We can only assume this is because he is in fact [[ugly]] [[irl]], yet his behavior most of the time is deceptively normal, which means he's probably a [[crazy|dangerous psycho]]. Luckily though, his powers of [[retard|TARTlet]] manipulation don't go beyond getting people to draw him [[fuck]]ing a video game character.

When he's not drawing his [[Mary Sue]] self raping Peach, he's drawing almost every other female Nintendo character in the nude like the [[sex]]-crazed Nintendo maniac that he is. This is why he doesn't draw Nintendo characters like black person Kong, [[pedophile|Wario]], and [[fag|Meta Knight]], to name a few. On occasion, he'll also draw himself raping anime characters as he also happens to be a [[weeaboo]], as if that wasn't obvious already.

Not surprisingly, Sigurd was a forum admin at a place called ''[http://www.peach-paradise.com/pp/portals/_default/skins/peachparadiseskin/pp/Forum/tabid/81/Default.aspx Peach Paradise],'' where other [[otaku]] who like Princess Peach [[fangirl|a little too much]] fully accept his status as Princess Peach's self-proclaimed [[boyfriend]]. He even lists being her boyfriend as one of his occupations on his profile there, and proclaims himself her [[AIDS|lover]] in his forum signature.
 
As unbearable as his fanboy obsession might be, we can actually be thankful for it as this means that out of the love he has for a fictional character, he will '''never''' have offspring. He can only dream.

==Art==

[[Image:Systems_of_Romance_by_SigurdHosenfeld.jpg|thumb|Sigurd's self-insert [[Mary Sue]] and Peach. One can assume that it must be ''really'' cold in the [[Mario|Mushroom Kingdom]], as he always draws her with rock-hard [[tits|nipples]].]] 

Despite claiming to have a "pure love" for the princess whose only claim to fame is getting kidnapped and [[rape]]d and being able to [[drugs|float]] (possibly because she's so damn [[stupid|air-headed]]), he most commonly draws her with big, noticeable, rock hard nipples poking through her dress and in many [[lolicon|suspicious looking]] poses. This must mean he has [[porn]] ([[SigurdHosenfeld#Wall of Shame|and he does]]) somewhere on the [[internets]], and [[moar]] MUST be found [[fap|for great justice]].

He also [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/52661802/ does commissions for other losers] who [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/46813040/ are in love with video game characters] and want themselves drawn as young, unblemished metrosexuals.

Most TARTlets seem to assume that Sigurd just does shiny Peach [[fanart]], and somehow manage to turn a blind eye to the fact that more than half of his deviantART gallery is full of drawings of himself as Peach's [[boyfriend]], which only proves the fact that he needs to get a real life.

==Website==
Ever since God [[pwned]] the abomination that was Peach Paradise and it keeled over and died, Sigurd was in desperate need of a haven for his Peach [[faggotry]], and [http://www.princess-peach.net/ so he made his own]. It includes things such as all of the same [[SigurdHosenfeld#Sigurd.27s_Unique_Art_Style|lala-kun]] ripoff art you've seen before, plus creepy extras [http://www.princess-peach.net/bio.htm like a biography of Princess Peach]:

{{squote|Love is another very complicated and sensitive area for the Princess, both for being received and given to others. Peach often discusses her personal feelings towards Mario through conversations with others, albeit in an implied manner, but appears reluctant to reveal them to him personally. Unfortunately, this has left the relationship's development completely stagnant, as neither party shows any signs of making a first move. It has also opened the window for speculation, especially considering the frequency of others in the Marioverse developing or possessing some form of affection or crush towards her.|Peachsnogger, reading way too far into children's video games.}}

====Wall of Shame====
Sigurd is well known in [[sick fuck]] circles for his [[hentai]] of [[Nintendo]] characters (especially Peach, of course). Even though [[geek]]s who like to [[fap]] to Peach and Daisy's [[tit]]s worship the ground he walks on, his hentai is elusive and doesn't appear to be stowed away in a gallery anywhere. Luckily, [[anonymous]] can always count on [[Google]] and [[AGNPH|forums full of perverts]].

====Sigurd's Unique Art [[Robert Hawkins|Style]]====

[[Image: HosenFAILED_Guide.jpg|thumb|right|Use this guide provided by Anonymous to tell Sigurd's fanwank from the Mystery Jap's.]]

Once upon a time Sigurd looked at his artwork and thought "This is some [[fugly]] shit", so he decided to improve his drawing style. This "improvement" consisted of finding a more talented but less known artist, stealing his art-style, and then his identity. The artist in question was someone called "**" from a [[Japanese]] [[Oekaki]] board. Their artwork can be found [http://danbooru.donmai.us/post?page=5&tags=lala-kun here]. Sigurd fans have been known to cause mild drama whenever anyone makes the distinction between the Jap's art and Sigurd's, as Sigurd would have the world believe that he and the Jap are one and the same.

<center><gallery>
Image:PeachMonglerpron.jpg|By following the guide even [[your mom]] can tell that this wasn't drawn by Sigurd.
Image:DaisyPron.jpg|Neither was this, if the fact that it isn't Peach didn't tip you off.

==Reaction to this article==

[[Image:Peachsnoggerreaction.jpg|frame|center|OH SHI-]] 

[[Death_Note#JUST_AS_PLANNED|Not as planned]].

You can help by coordinating a multiple person interaction with this tartlet and call Peach a slut or bimbo as he doesn't take kindly to people speaking poorly of his [[imaginary girlfriend]]. Alternatively, you can just tell him he's a shitty artist or how pathetic he is to be jerking it to some old Jap's doodles. Be advised that on dA he will [[cry|report]] you instantly and block you from commenting. He also lurks the chans in search of people talking about him (mostly the [[hentai]] and various [[Rule 34]] boards), and prides himself in the fact that there have never been any real lulz coming from his [[butthurt]]. There's even a very good chance that he's been editing this article! He’s so confident, he’s gone as far as to give up his anonymity to respond in threads talking about him. He secretly hates other [[fanboy]]s as obsessed as him and feels his love for Peach is threatened, but likes to pretend he's a [[fag|gentleman]] and would never be caught admitting it.
