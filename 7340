Secret crush meme
The '''[http://www.euthanize.us/memes/secret-crush-meme/ Secret Crush Meme]''' was an [[online quiz]] produced by a company named Anonymous Consulting sometime in mid-[[2003]]. If you entered your [[LiveJournal]] username and indicated which of your fellow users you had a crush on, the quiz would provide you with a chart showing who on your [[friends list]] had a crush on you, as well as what "kind" of crush they had (public, secret or ex). Obviously, the quiz was designed to harvest crushes between [[LJ User|LiveJournal users]] (hence the huge disclaimer). 

Sometime in October 2003, a new quiz, called [http://www.euthanize.us/memes/crushmeme/ Secret Crush Meme 2: The Revenge of Secret Crush Meme] was released, which showed users how many crushes other users had on them, as well as what kind. Not that big a deal right? Well, there was a catch. For four dollars, the company would sell you a list of users who had secret crushes on you. [[Oh noes|OH NOES]] CLOWNING OF [[Memesheep|MEMESHEEP]]! This created lots of [[drama]] between couples who listed other users as crushes, people getting ex-crushes when they felt they should have gotten public crushes, and a bunch of [[bullshit|ethics debating]].

The system was later cloned by [http://www.ljmeme.com ljmeme.com], but it wasn't as dramariffic as the original.
