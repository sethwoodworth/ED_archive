__FORCETOC__


== Austin ==
There was much win to be had as at least 200 Anon showed up to protest the Co$. They even sung happy birthday to Lisa McPherson.
Creepy Scientologist photographers hid in the bushes behind the protesters and photographed/videotaped Anonymous. Also, you can't forget the Anon protest van that drove around the block all day, at the beginning of the day a group of Anon piled out of the back of the van.

Mark Plummer, a victim of the "church" interviewed at the protest. Listen to what this guy has to say, he was in the church for 20 years and has a lot of good info on his site: [[http://warrior.xenu.ca/]]

EPIC Win on many levels. 110 Anonymous + Several victims of Scientology showed up to protest. News Coverage by Fox 4(For two minutes :( ) And coverage by WFAA ABC-8. Punch and Pie were served. In conclusion, Went off without a hitch.

81 anon showed up for Houston raid. Police supportive, with news coverage on at least two stations. Not sure if any anons were followed. One anon brought cheeseburgers for everyone - epic win. More pics and videos soon, I hope.

I drove about an hour to take pictures [[For_great_justice|FOR GREAT JUSTICE]], but got lost a little because [[shit|Google]] maps is craps

Still going strong... well, it was still going when i got there around 4-5pm. [[for_the_lulz|Hail Xenu'd]], then left. Definentally want to come to the next one though.
<br>
Rumor is that the anon in the red scarf (the police contact) and his party were followed for about 10 minutes before the pursuit was lost.

== Memphis ==
We had over 40 people attend throughout the day, including anons from three states. The day went really well, with a lot of neighborhood support and no interaction from the Memphis Scientology Mission. We saw them through the windows, watching us, but they never came out.

== Cincinnati ==
More coming, for now, check this out. One of the only Sci buildings that had a meeting. Here they are clapping in unison. Not clapping to a song, or applauding- think 'All glory to the hypnotoad'.

== Minneapolis ==
The Minneapolis raid was GREAT SUCCESS. There were over 100 Anon at our peak. They filmed us the entire time from the second story window of the CoS building. We drew the attention of Fox 9 and WCCO cameramen as well. Starbucks rolled out the red carpet for us, voiced their support for the cause, and gave us free coffee. It was -14 degrees with even deadlier windchills, so give MN Anon extra free internets for their badass commitment.

We touched base with many people and the sparse pedestrian traffic on Nicollet Mall was overall very sympathetic and interested in the cause. We stationed people across the church, on either street corner, and in the skyway. We aren't sure how many flyers were handed out, but we estimate it may have been OVER 9000!!! The cops were cool, the people were cool, the weather was cool. The two suspected scifags who tossed flyers at Anons on two seperate occasions though were not, nor was the creepy old scifag standing in the doorway watching the us the entire time, or the crazy scifag yelling into his phone for the whole six hours.

This was an EPIC WIN for Minneapolis Anon. Looking forward to the Ides of March. HAIL XENU!!!111~
