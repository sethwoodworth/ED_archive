Portugal
[[Image:Niger.jpg|thumb|right|Not Portugal]]
'''Portugal''' is like the California of Europe, full of [[Eurofags|eurofags]], [[socialists|pinko]]s, [[drug|drugs]], [[pedos]], Paulo Querido and, strangely enough, Portuguese people. Just like California, it is located in the westernmost part of Europe. Unlike California, Portugal has [[poor|no IRL monies]], and it sucks.

The people who dwell there are known as Portugayse or, to [[capitalism|capitalists]], as Pigs.

Fun Facts: only [[over 9000|one out of ten]] Piggie children know that Portugal is a country. No one can find it on a map. [[Pedophile|Tourists]] recognize Portugal mainly for its greatest achievement, losing Madeleine McCann. The best thing to have ever come out of Portugal is the highway to Spain.

==Food==
[[Image:Common_snail.jpg|thumb|right|Typical Portuguese delicacy.]]
Pigs eat strange food. They eat snails and other stuff like that, and they love it. They also have dishes which would be qualified as creepy by nearly everyone. Most of them consist on mixing up every single part of pork (like ears, nose, balls and cock) with beans, bread or even potatoes, let it float for a while on yummy liquid straight from [[Tubgirl]]'s anus and then find fancy names for them such as "papas de sarrabulho" or "cozido à porkieguesa". They also eat something called codfish, used also in the military as a shield, and considered a national dish even though most of it is imported from [[Norway]]. They have also been known for eating [[Lotus Breast|lamprey]] and [[Rip and tear|cow's guts]].

==[[Science|Investigation and Development]]==
[[Image:Portuguese B.jpg|thumb|right|The result of Portugal's most advanced technology in bottled flavored [[internets]].]]
Portugal is the first country in the world to have successfully produced and distributed bottled [[b/|/b/]]. Comes in many flavors, such as Orange, Lemon[[aids]], and others more random like [[Wat|Coffee and Lemon]].

==Foreign Relations==
None. All good Portuguese people went to [[Brazil]] - but since there were [[noone]] anyway, Brazil [[Nigeria|stayed the same]]. Portugal has not had an international dispute [[at least 100 years ago|since 1801]]. They have [[France]] and [[Spain]] to keep out the [[Nazi]]s. They are also the UK's bitches. [[Shit nobody cares about|Their once great empire]] fell down in a matter of years, something pigs still [[baw]] over today.

*José Saramago - [[Shit nobody cares about|Literature Nobel Prize]] possibly won thanks to being the only guy who can write whole books without a goddamned period, dash or comma, get away with it, and even be praised for his [[special|unique]] style of writing. Adored by [[communism|communists]] everywhere.
*[[You|Maddie's kidnapper]] - Runs a [[pwn]] shop in south central Lisbon.

==Life==
[[Image:1205797748473.gif|thumb|right|Portugal is pretty [[awesome]].]]
It is a well known [[fact]] that 90% of the population in Portugal is [[emo|depressed]] and/or [[fail|unlulzy]]. This is why many people move to [[Brazil]], which is the FALSE Portuguese speaking country. Most youth today are either [[guidos]] or [[goths]].

==Economy==
Since all of Portugal is black market software and [[CP]] trade, the offical Per Capita GDP is Cork. The CP trade is booming; however, the software pirating industry is being undermined by [[China]]. Currently there are no [[lulz]] exported from Portugal. There is a VAT of 21% that even though makes Portugal an [[anti-lulz]] country, still makes their leader an [[I did it for the lulz|epic IRL troll]]. There have been talks about changing Portugal's currency back to [[shit|mud]], since it's the only thing nationalistic [[shit]]s can fap about.

==Trolling Piggies==
Ways to troll Pigs

* Tell them Portugal is a part of Spain.
* If they start speaking Portuguese say: "I'm sorry, I don't speak [[moonspeak|Spanish]]", much more successfully used in trolling Spanish people.
* Tell them all their women have [[trap|mustaches]].
* Ask them if they can speak Brazilian.
* Remind them of how much more successful Brazil is despite their people being [[irony|poor and homeless]].
* Also mention "Brazil" and "Soccer" in the same sentence.
* Say that Portugal got their independence from [[Brazil]].
* Say Messi is better than Ronaldo.
* Actually, making fun of their soccer teams and players is the only thing that'll get them to [[rage]].
* If they talk about their fascinating history, ask them if they aren't butthurt about losing half the world in less than a century.
