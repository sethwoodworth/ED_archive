'''[http://www.reputationdefender.com Reputation Defender]''' is a [[lulz]] removing service used by [[lol-cow]]s. These scam artists take your [[IRL]] money and promise they can remove internet information.  [[What]]?  Internet assholes of the highest order, they brag to the media that they send [[legal action|threatening]] legal letters to websites to remove material - knowing full well they have [[You vs. ED|no basis]]. Founded by [[law|Lawlschool]] drop-out, [[internet asshole|delusional douchebag]], and noted homosexual [[meth]]-addict Michael Fertik, Reputation Defender promises to "DESTROY" [[drama|e-drama]]. However, this is impossible as it violates the '''Second Lawl of Internets Drama-Dynamics''': ''Drama in the E-Universe is always increasing.'' 
[[Image:Owen-Tripp.jpg|thumb|right|Owen Tripp shiteating shill for the Reputation Defender scam, wipes the cum off his lips after sucking media cock for free publicity]]

Reassuring empirical evidence of the Second Lawl is quickly surmised by reviewing the results of various high-profile Reputation Defender clients...
 





== Client Profiles==
Reputation Defender's clients include Lolcows (who feel entitled to
nothing but Hosannas from google) or crooks (who use RD to cover 
news reports of their fraud).  Here are some of RD's former clients... and the ways they got milked for ca$h and greater LULZ:

'''''Backstory:''''' The [[Nikki_Catsouras|full backstory]] on Nicole Catsouras is ugly:
{{quote|She was an 18 year old whore who proved, yet again, that women can't drive. On Halloween 2006 she decided to steal her father's $150,000 Porsche and take it for a drive. She was later found dead with traces of cocaine in her system. Having hit another car and slammed into a concrete tollbooth at approximately 100 mph and subsequent [[barrel roll]]. In typical emo "no one understands me" drama she became one with a toll booth on highway 241, her head smashed to bits.}}

A job for '''''R-r-r-r-r-r-r-eputation Defender-r-r-r-r-r!'''''     Dumbass CEO Michael Fertik approached the Catsouras family with an [[Shit|idea]]: he would farm out the family for interviews, thus milking the fools of free publicity.  In exchange, Fertik promised to nuke the offending pictures from the 'net.

'''''Result:''''' [http://www.newsweek.com/id/195073/page/2 EPIC FAIL.]  Fertik's shitty company hit the wall harder than the bitch whose family he'd swindled.

'''''Backstory:''''' Ronnie Segev was pissed off. Priceline charged him for a ticket he didn't buy. So he called for a refund.  They told him to fuck off.  He called again.  They told him to fuck off.  So...you get the picture.  215 calls later, the company called the NYPD.

Once you get known as a complete fraud, GOOD LUCK getting further funding! What could poor [http://mortgagegrapevine.com/thread/?thread=549418 Rodney Sparrow] do to get new suckers?

Why, turn to REPUTATION DEFENDER-R-R-R-R, of course! Over the last few months, Reputation Defender spammed the internet, trying to bump down all those truthful links about how [http://mortgagegrapevine.com/thread/?thread=591332 Rodney Sparrow] SCAMMED scores of people out of thousands of dollars (we also hear that, like Reputation Defender faggot [http://www.autoadmit.com/thread.php?thread_id=783656&forum_id=2&PHPSESSID=e2ee948d44ce86c496d90fa264cd2fdc Ross Chanin], Sparrow [http://dockets.justia.com/docket/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2008cv02601/271766/ got his ass SUED] for fucking peeps over).  

All of which illustrates an obvious point: cocksucker Michael Fertik and Reputation Defender don't CARE whether you really raped those kids, [[LULZ | scammed old ladies out of their life savings]], or even if you [[Kenny_Glenn_The_Animal_Abuser | tortured kittens for sick "fun"]]...Reputation Defender will do everything it can to whitewash the internet of all the shit that makes it harder for you to be a child molester, scammer or criminal.

===[[Divide By Zero|Itself]]===
We've established that Reputation Defender is a huge scam and, by extension, Michael Fertik is a huge cocksucker. So, how is it that the company still exists and is defrauding people out of money? Shouldn't the internet be rife with conversations about how goddamn stupid this service is and how the owner should suffer the [[Nikki Catsouras|the same fate as his clients]]? Really folks, if you want your reputation defended, you might start by hiring somebody who can actually [[E-lawyer|pass the fucking bar exam]].

Enter '''''R-r-r-r-r-r-r-eputation Defender-r-r-r-r-r'''''! Michael Fertik spends approximately every hour of his waking life building webpages explaining how serious [[Bulling is rabbit|internet bullying]] is, and how Reputation Defender will help prevent the evil trolls from [[Buy A Dog|burning your curtains and your little dog too]]. He spends all day linking said [[clusterfuck]] of websites and using his [[F5|magic button]] to get traffic. Then, through the [[Hæti|evil juju]] of the [[Google bomb]], he tries to force all his detractors to the [[Missing White Womyn Syndrome|seventh results page of Google search hell]].

'''''Result:''''' The sad fact is that as long as there are people who have [[unwarranted self-importance]] and [[money]], Reputation Defender will be able to sell its [[Nothing|product]]. And as long as said insecure people give Reputation Defender money, it will have all the disposable income it needs to buy [[sockpuppet]] websites, [[Spam|advertise]], and [http://www.radicalparenting.com/2009/05/10/this-weeks-sponsor-reputation-defender/ bribe people to extol its virtues.] Even better, every time Fertik fucks up, he gets [[Profit|free publicity]] because news reports inevitably mention that he was attempting to [[Rape|defend]] his clients and not to [[I did it for the lulz|make their internet humiliation a major news story]].

Google suggests "scam" after you type "Reputation Defender" though, so at least the mindless search engine has the right idea.
