Solipsism
'''sol·ip·sism'''

The realization that there is no brain beyond the brain; everyone besides [[you]] is a complete idiot and fails at life and everything.  There was no world before [[last Thursday]], when you were born.  There is no [[God]], and there are certainly no [[girls]] who will ever get with you.  You are all alone in the universe, and should probably consider a timely demise (namely [[suicide]])


----


An internet/blog related psychodisease that precludes thought about anyone but oneself.

Most commonly found in tech females and strippers where constant male admiration causes an inflated sense of worth.
