Jibba Foxcoon
'''Jibba Foxcoon''', aka Jason Bernard Smith, is a [[furry]] known throughout the fandom as a high profile comedian and spreader of [[AIDS]]. Unsurprisingly, many furries consider the former more notable.

==Comedy==

Jibba is primarily known throughout furrydom as a top notch comedian. He got his big break after opening for [[2 gryphon]] at Anthrocon. Most of his set revolves around being [[gay]], [[furries]], being a homosexual, furfaggotry, likes anal sex, fursuits, spreading STD's and the furry fandom. While many would see that as incredibly repetitive and not anything worth watching, furries look at this and see [[genius]], and as such Jibba has become a VIP at every subsequent Anthrocon, being given his own set and treated as a [[celebrity]] amongst the denizens of the conventions.

Like many comedians, Jibba uses his stand up to regal the audience with tales of his [[ghetto|unique]] childhood with such stories as being institutionalized for being gay by his [[Christian|Baptist]] mother, being afraid of and repulsed by [[vaginas]], and the everyday struggles of [[obesity]].

==Adventures in Transmission==

Somewhere between spreading antilulz, Jibba made a point to start spreading HIV. Being the big fat party animal he advertises himself as during his routines, he takes great joy in his demented orgies and deviant behavior. After one such orgy, a fellow homofur was diagnosed with the AIDS. When this individual made the story public, he was raped even further by Jibbas PR squad. Jibba had his goons go on a [[wolfeedarkfang|massive cover-up operation]] and [[delete fucking everything|pull offensive material]] pertaining to the incident. Because of such secret policing, information regarding Jibba is scarce, a rarity due not only to a furry's natural lust for attention, but also given his [[Chris Crocker|notoriety]] among the subculture. In stark contrast to every other furry in existence, every profile of Jibba's has been wiped clean, keeping only a LiveJournal and a barebones [[WikiFur]] article, which is often vandalized by people wishing to spread the truth to the masses, though the warnings are quickly erased by WikiFur Admins content with towing with party line.

According to [[fact|rumor]], Jibba deliberately fails to mention his affliction to those on the receiving end of his flabby lust and sends his friends to go after those who speak against him so he can continue to spread the disease as much as he can before keeling over. The current count for his adventures in transmission puts him at 9 people. All of which as the rumor states he got them drunk and raped them. This puts many non-furries at a crossroads; while Jibba is doing his hardest to spread the furry AIDS to the rest of the population, he seems to be trying even harder to spread actual AIDS amongst the furries. For that, [[some argue|some speculate]] Jibba is among the greatest trolls ever.

==Everything Else==

Because of Jibba and Co. policy of removing everything negative of him on the internet, there is literally [[nothing]] on him anywhere on the internet save a LiveJournal. There, Jibba often cracks [[shit|rib tickling]] jokes and features videos of him dancing, in addition to [[Shit nobody cares about|general observations about everyday life]]. Jibba is also a well known dance instructor and several of his dance lessons may be viewed on his YouTube channel. Jibba has also began taking up funds for creating his very own furry studio, and while he never explicitly states what he intends to produce, it's assumed it's either furry comedy, [[sodomy|erotica]], or some mix between the two.

Oh, and punching in his [[powerword]] immediately brings up several gay services where he advertises his desire for one night stands and groups dedicated to fistfucking and anal he belongs to. This very same powerword also brings up his MySpace and Friendster profiles; however, as Jibba actually advertises his depravity and has build such sick fuckery into a considerable career in comedy for himself, it's unlikely revealing these groups and clubs to anyone will result in any good drama. [[Prove me wrong|Challengers are always welcome to try, however]].
