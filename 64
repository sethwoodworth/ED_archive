2009
[[Image:ED2009.jpg|center|thumb|700px|YEAH]]

'''2009''' has been yet another banner year that has blessed us with some of the more notable internet happenings that you have come to expect from this wonderful medium that we choose to exploit and use.  The usual gang of internet nerds, retards, and angry mobsters have outdone themselves once again and have made 2009 an unexpectedly grand year in lulz.  Folks like [[crusader cat]] have offered us a chance to brighten our days with laughter, while memes such as [[Zalgo]] have given us a pause where we might reflect upon the fact that this internet thing is quite silly, and finally, the [[Dan Lirette]] story taught us that babies only die when you kick them in the head.

But that's not all — 2009 showed us the softer side of the internet as well. [[animal abuse|Heartwarming tales]] such as [[Kenny Glenn]], [[Cheyenne Cherry]], [[Camille Marino]], [[DracoGuard]], and [[Esachasa]] displayed mankind's ever-open heart, sympathy, and his ability to show compassion for his fellow animals.

And that's not all! Encyclopedia Dramatica also showcased several misfortunes that senselessly deprived us of our beloved entertainers.  Massive buttgrief and sorrow was expended upon the deaths of [[snca|Farrah Fawcett]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Billy Mays]], [[snca|Patrick Swayze]], and [[liberal|Ted Kennedy]]. 

There have been some good irl trolls as well, the [[lol|biggest]] being [[Tony48219]], but let's not forget the most spectacular troll of all: the fact that Encyclopedia Dramatica turned [[ED5|5]] this year despite all of its detractors, skeptics, haters, and doubters. During the festivities [[P-p-p-powerbook!]] won [[pollfest|the contest]] for best article ever, upsetting [[Chris-chan]]. And on top of all of this internet hoopla, ED got its own [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php forum], which would [[Casual Friday|make it a tradition to destroy itself once a week]].

[[2006|Once again]], the most important thing to know before reading this article is that [[Fred Bauder]] cannot practice law in the state of Colorado due to soliciting a client's wife for prostitution.
