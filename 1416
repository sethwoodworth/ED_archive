Chameleon
''[[noone cares|Looking for the song, "Karma Chameleon" by]] [[faggot|Boy George]]?  [[Offended|Click here.]]''
[[Image:Hypocrite!230x150.gif|thumb|Chameleon.]]
Started with the [[image]] from [[wc3forum.tk]], created ''BUFF.'', a [[noob]].  Taking up the legacy of the [[Olde|OLDE]] [[NO U]] craze, [[Chameleon]] redirects the argument toward the [[OP]].
<br>
Example:
:Prima: Wow, all your posts are shit
:Secunda: Chameleon

Posting the image is not needed unless [[forced meme|trying to spread the]] [[meme]].  Another version that doesn't contain the word ''Hypocrite!'' has been popular, but it's [[ghey]] because it [[goatse]]s the page on [[/hr/|1024x768 resolution]].

The newest image used by [[oldfag|oldfags]] says ''Chameleon!''  Meant to be introduced after the meme is worn out after [[at least 100 years]].
