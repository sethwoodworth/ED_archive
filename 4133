Isaac Hayes

'''Isaac Hayes''' was an [[unfunny]] black person and voice actor who was most famous for being the voice of the token [[black]] character "Chef" in ''[[South Park]]'' and then became much, much [[DO NOT WANT|less famous]] when it was revealed that he had left the show because of [[Hypocrite|his firm belief]] in [[Scientology]]. Many are still of the belief that he may have actually left because ''[[Black Cock|Chocolate Salty Balls]]'' became far more popular than his much famed score for ''[[Anus|Shaft]]''.

On August 10th, 2008, Isaac Hayes died from a stroke. By dying, Chef managed to avoid a more humiliating [[death]] at the hands of a [[white]] [[cop]] or from going broke by donating all of his money to fight [[lie|an impending Thetan invasion]]. Some fans think that, despite Isaac Hayes's loyalty, the Co$ had him killed when they finally realized that he was not the black person they wanted as a celebrity spokesman. What a fucking sucker.

{{quote|In ten years and over 150 episodes of 'South Park,' Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslim, Mormons or Jews. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion [Scientology] featured on the show.|Matt Stone|[[South Park]] co-creator}}
