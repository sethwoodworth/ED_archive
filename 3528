Gunther
'''[http://www.gunthernet.com/ Gunther]''' videos have been fagging up YouTube for the past year or so, the most notable being "The Ding Dong Song".  Listen to it if you dare, it gets stuck in your head easier than "Re: your brains" and "Cherry [[Chocolate Rain]]" combined. Gunther's music is something you wouldn't expect outside of a rave or [[16 year old girl]]s bedroom.  It's very reminiscent of [[shit bands|The Real McCoys]] from the early 90's.  In other words, nerds are going apeshit over the perceived awesomeness Gunther. The Ding Ding Dong Song was done strictly for the lulz, as a parody of other similarly homoerotic videos of the era.

==The Video==
The Video features Gunther with a homo-stache and talking with a deep gravely voice. There are lots of hot girls fondling eachother. The reason they are fondling each other is because [[homo|Gunther is clearly not interested in them]]. Unfortunately, during the early 90s, this was the kind of horrifying Euro-trash that would steal your date at the club. The terribly ironic thing about this is that even after stealing your girlfriend they would not fuck her, because they were all raging homos. Gunther deserves a pat on the back for lulzily [[Grunge|parodying a trend that we are all glad is dead]].
