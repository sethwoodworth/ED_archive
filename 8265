Popular amongst [[nerd]]s, [[basement dwellers]], Pro [[Noobs]], [[libertarians]] and the [[Hot Topic]] crowd alike, '''''The Matrix''''' is a franchise of [[shit]]ty science fiction movies and products intended to part idiots from their cash. ''The Matrix'' is also the birthplace of a million [[old meme|stupid memes]] based on quotes such as "There is no spoon," "I know kung fu!" and that FBI Terminator dude cracking his neck and saying "[[Hurr|Misturrr Andurrrson...]]" Its main purpose is to peddle [[Buddhism]] and Gnosticism to angsty [[teen]]s.

==A Gigantic Rip-Off==
''The Matrix'' is actually a [[DOUBLE NIGGER|double ripoff]], as the plot is lifted directly from the comic book ''The Invisibles'', which stole nearly all of its ideas from Phillip K. [[Dick]]'s ''VALIS''. Also, the basic concept of the Matrix was appropriated from Gnostic lore and [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Scientology|alternative reality]], which is still superior to the boring green Tae-bo bullshit that the Wachowski assholes came up with.

[[FAT|Alex Proyas']] ''Dark City'' was shot in the same city, the same Sydney train station and the same sound stages at Fox Studios (using many of the exact same sets that had been built two years before). The narrative of ''The Matrix'' derives most of its best ideas from ''Dark City'' and ''[[Animu|Ghost In The Shell]]''.

== The Movies ==
[[Image:RetardInMatrix.jpg|thumb|right|Neo in ''The Matrix'']]
===The Matrix===
The first movie had something to do with [[computers]] taking over the [[world]], [[WOW|controlling people with virtual reality]] and secret missions in which insurgents are dressed like ostentatious, highly conspicuous [[emo]]-[[goth]] queers with [[fake|glued-on]] shades and [[tiny penis|big guns]]. In the movie's most entertaining scene, [[columbine|two trenchcoat-garbed heroes walk into a building and start shooting everybody in sight]].

===The Matrix 2: [[Electric Boogaloo]]===
The second film was a huge, expensive waste of time designed to justify the franchise's requisite trilogy. In this one, Morpheus babbles on and on about [[Goatse|The One]], and how he needs to be rescued. The writers also [[lazy|kill about half of the movie's running time]] with a [[tl;dw]] car chase and scenes in which everyone jumps around like [[faggot]] pixies.

===The Matrix Revolutions===
The third film is rumored to suck hairy sack, but this can neither be confirmed or denied as [[noone]] bothered to see it. Fortunately, Neo becomes [[an hero]].

===Animatrix===
Shitty [[animu]] cartoons based on the films. Not much is known about this, as it was only seen by [[weeaboo]]s.

== Video Games ==
[[Image:Enter-the-matrix-3.jpg|thumb|right|Shit like this happens all the time in [[Las Vegas]].]]
After the second movie, ''Enter The Matrix'' was made by the machines to further the franchise revenues. A sub-par, incomplete, incoherent, graphically abominable game....[[Completist|BUT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MATRIX...SORTA]]!!1 Its only reference to the Matrix is that everyone looks like a [[The Man|corporate prick]] who just walked out of a board meeting, and you can run around like a brain-dead version of Spider-Man.

After the third movie, just when you thought it was safe to say that this franchise was dead, ''The Matrix Online'' was born to The Wachowski Brothers. They promptly abandoned the [[MMORPG]] like a newborn in a trash can on prom night. [http://www.massively.com/2009/05/29/soe-is-jacking-out-of-the-matrix-online/ This pile of shit was shut down] by Sony in [[2009]].

Upon its release, ''The Matrix: The Path of Neo'' was immediately ignored by everyone.

==  The Annoying Screensaver ==
[[Image:Matrix.gif|thumb|100px|Green LCD = never gets layed evar.]] 
'''[[Chocolate Rain|Digital Rain]]''' is the title of a screensaver (see right) popular with [[geek]]s, presumably because its use of green LCD characters makes them feel [[leet]], as if that's something to [[aspierations|aspire]] to. If you see this on somebody's computer, it's a dead giveaway that they are a virgin.
