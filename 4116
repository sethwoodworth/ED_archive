Chris '''Bores (The Shit Out Of Us)''', also known as '''The Irate Gamer''' is a fat, lulzless YouTube user, pretending to be a gamer, who thought there weren't enough [[Angry Video Game Nerd]] ripoffs on the internets. On April 28th, 2007, Irate Gamer put up a review of Back to the Future for the NES that was AVGN's exact review with his voice dubbed over, making the same exact points on Marty's vest, his skateboard, the game's enemies and mimicking James' exact body movements with his controller by using a pirated copy Sony Vegas on a computer that he traded cocaine to some black person for. Soon afterward, [[internet tough guy|fans of the Angry Video Game Nerd]] went on the attack to contain Irate Gamer's AIDS attack, but were butthurt and cut off by Irate Gamer's own internet tough guys.

Irate Gamer would later reveal that he doesn't know shit about video games, by trashing classic games like Ghosts n' Goblins, Super Mario Brothers 2, Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and Tetris, and expecting everyone to agree with him about how these games are "way too hard" and suck. Later Irate gamer would admit that he has never owned any video game consoles before he bought his entire game collection on eBay. All just to sell [[profit|DVDs]].

Today, the Irate Gamer Syndicate spans all of the YouTubes, where any dissent towards him is repressed, and dissidents are flamed to death by butthurt Irate Goon Squads and all movies exposing his blatant plagiarism are DMCA'd by the Irate gamer himself, through his pathetic company [http://www.y2bproductions.com/ Y2B (''Yippie 2 Bungholes'') Productions].

Irate Gamer is the perfect predecessor to the first Angry Sega Genesis Nerd.

[[Image:Irate_gamer.jpgâ€Ž|thumb|300px|Typical Chris Bores fangirl.]]

[[Image:Irapegamer.png|thumb|Well, don't you know?]]On September 10, 2007, having sneaked on to YouTube relatively unnoticed, Irate Gamer watched and hijacked James Rolfe Review 93 (the Ninja Turtles review) and copied it to spread his mixture of AIDS, [[fail]] and anti-lulz on a scale never before witnessed, where he cried about the same problems with the game as the AVGN did; with the enemies, the dam level, bosses, and used the same exact spotlight effect to show a power up that was unobtainable in the game, hence how the IRATE Gamer birthed to an already-butthurt [[internets]]. Despite the frequency of [[IMMA CHARGIN|charging his vocal layzors]], he fails because he thinks reviewing games is [[serious business]]. Silly fool, only the internets is serious business. Despite his massive amounts of fail, he is still useful for great proxy lulz due to the exorbitant amount of hate he gets on his reviews. Later Irate Gamer would review about how he thinks the shapes of the marshmallows in Lucky Charms are' next he will stick it up his ass [[serious business|serious fucking business]].

==In the year 2007, lulz was beginning==

A man by the name of [[Fag|Silent Rob]] declared war on the internets with Irate Gamer, suspecting that Irate Gamer had weapons of mass deletion. With an army of haters, internet tough guys, sock puppet accounts, Gunfever members and other types of internet weapons and hardware, Silent Rob deployed a video about how Irate Gamer loves the [[cock]]. Silent Rob's message was heavily diluted among 200+ instances of the word "cock", while pointing out similarities between AVGN and IG, and the failings of the M.U.S.C.L.E. review. He predicted that the upcoming TMNT review (At the time there was only a trailer for it) would be a ripoff of AVGN's review, and was hailed as [[Jesus]] when it came out. Irate Gamer would not let his AIDS fail and retaliated by having YouTube delete his video (Since he used footage of the Irate Gamer, which is a no-no), making Silent Rob an martyr for the cause. Sensing drama like blood in the water, fans were inspired to counterattack with hate videos of Irate Gamer liking the cock. During this time, Irate Gamer had amassed a huge army of fanboys, hereafter known as Irate Gamer Nazis. In the soon coming wars tons of [[lulz]], fail (mostly), and butthurt (enjoyed mostly by Chris Bores himself) was to be had. Irate Gamer has since become one of the most loved/hated people on YouTube, becoming [[an hero|an chadwardenn]] of his time.

==The Irate-Angry Conflict heats up==

While Angry Video Game Nerd fans were quick to accuse the Irate Gamer of ripping off AVGN mannerisms such as the phrase [[shit nobody cares about|shitload of fuck]], the concept of reviewing games while stringing curse words together and argue the similarities as previously outlined.  Self appointed bad ass mother fucker (now turned whining pussy) ''[[SilentRob]]'' AKA ''[[LeisureSuitGaming]]'' and Amish look-a-like ''Roth'' ''(SlyDogStudios/PlayTheNES.com)'' astounded the gaming world with this shocking evidence:

<center>'''The Irate Gamer accused of Plagiarising AVGN's videos:'''<br>
<video type="livevideo" id="96956A9FC8BB489EA7BC99AAADF8B61C" width="450" height="400" desc="Irate Gamer VS AVGN Comparison" position="center"/><br><br></center>

IG fans responded by accusing the AVGN of ripping off the IG also. According to [[sockpuppet|''iratefanboy345'']], ''"The proof is undeniable"'':

'''AVGN accused of Plagiarising The Irate Gamer's videos:'''

It would be undeniable, if you were willing to overlook the fact that:

''1. There really IS a guy in Die Hard who looks like Steve Urkel''<br>
''2. Contrasting one thing to another has only been done for millenniums.''<br>
''3. The glowing eyeballs thing was actually originally posted August 19, 2006 on [http://www.screwattack.com/index12.html ScrewAttack], as if it was really unique at the time.''<br>
''4. Oh hay look, the [[RIAA]] should sue them both!''<br>

[[shit nobody cares about|IG fans went on to accuse the AVGN of ripping his Wally Bear & The No! Gang and Atari Porno reviews from articles written by]] [[Seanbaby]][[shit nobody cares about|, that AVGN only started increasing his production values and special effects after the IG upped the ante, Silent Rob + LuizPrower + BigAl2k6 = stupid haters (Irony amirite?), and viva la Irate Revolution.]] Of course, like [[butthurt|any other YouTube user facing a wave of disapproval]], he deletes and screens any negative comments left on his videos, be it general disapproval, or genuine plagiarism calls.

This also started some AVGN fanboy's epic quest to pose as the AVGN to [[bawww|piss off]] the Irate Gamer's ass raeped fanboys (called the ''Angry Arcade Kid'' or ''Andrew Crogonk''), but until this shit blows over, we're denied [[nobody cares| the true winrar]] and 1337 king of rage.

==A note on his (boring) videos==

Unlike the [[AVGN]], who releases videos <s>every two weeks (that's a fortnight to [[Britfag|you]])</s> once a month, the Irate Gamer blesses the net with his work every [[OVER 9000|two to three months]] (often longer), always [[lie|promising]] his reviews will be "[[shit|epic]]" to make up for the wait. His fanboys, being the faithful [[retard|individuals]] they are, not only buy this but cream themselves when Mr. Bores posts his fail because ZOMG SPECIAL EFFECTS!!!!!!!!!!11111!, which [[no|absolutely]] makes up for his shit acting skills and fucktarded writing. Is there any wonder why the AVGN is a noob? Who the fuck wastes time with quality when you can have [[fag|SPARKLES]]?

==The Spam==

Under the impression that Mr. Bores is a fucking [[Plagiarism|plagiarist]], [[Angry Video Game Nerd|AVGN]] fanboys with [[b|no life]] thought it would be a good idea to spam the fatass's videos. IG, obviously king of the h4x, used his magical powers to shut down the comments, effectively ending the attacks. He then fapped in celebration and went back to making more fail.

==Irate Gamer NEO==

Unbelievably, Irate Gamer thinks there's [[truth|not enough of him]] as it is. To solve this problem, he came up with a new [[shit|show]] called '''[[Nazi|Irate Gamer NEO]]''', in which he unleashes his mighty e-peen to rip modern games a new asshole in return for [[lolwut|free consoles, games and computers]] from [http://www.gottgame.com/ GottGame]. 

Once again, he decided to skip the [[fail|usual]] method of actually playing the games before [[bawww|bawwing]] about them, so this [[Shit nobody cares about|series]] is just as shitty as everything else he's made.

[[Image:IGneonazi.jpg|right|thumb|The Irate Gamer as seen in Irate Gamer NEO (Nazi).]]

The games he's reviewed so far are:

*''[[The Simpsons|The Simpsons Game]]''
*''SD vs. RAW 2008''
*''Battalion Wars 2''
*''Mario [[lie|vs.]] Sonic at the Olympic Games''
*''[[Super Smash Bros.|Super Smash Bastard Bros.]]''
*''Zack and Wiki: Quest for Bungholes Treasure'' (based on his actual life)
*''Harvey Birdman''

*''Mario Kart [[Nintendo Wii|Wii]]''
*''[[Sex|Order Up]]''
*''Top 5 DS games: ''New Super Mario Bros.'', ''Mr. Driller: Drill Spirits'', ''Contra 4'', ''Lego Star Wars, Lego Indiana Jones, and Lego Batman'', and ''Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin''

*''<s>Tekken 6</s> [[fail|The Beat 'em up mode of Tekken 6, obviously the main feature of a FIGHTING GAME.]]
*''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time: [[lie|The Remake]]''

This list will be updated for [[moar]] [[fail|lulz]].

==Irate Gamer sucks up to the AVGN==

[[Image:RonJeremyandIG.jpg|thumb|The Irate Gamer is a massive dick even by Ron Jeremy's standards!]]

[[Image:IGneshand.jpg|thumb|Further [[photoshop|proof]] that Irate Gamer has [[basement dweller|no life.]]]]

[[Image:IGpizzasellout.jpg|thumb|"Thats right, in addition to conning you out of your money, I'm also [[Sell Out|selling out]] to Domino's!"]]

[[Image:iratemoney.jpg|thumb|[[I CAME]]!!]]

Despite his [[lie|insistence]] that he came up with the concept of being an [[original|angry video game reviewer]] out of the blue (as stated in his [[shit|DVD]], a private message Chris Bores sent to Angry Video Game Nerd seems to state otherwise. In it, he [[blowjob|sucks up]] to James and begs him to do a [[buttsecks|collaboration video]]. But Chris, in his [[fail|haste]], didn't realize that James doesn't actually maintain the [http://www.youtube.com/user/JamesNintendoNerd JamesNintendoNerd Youtube account] and [[fail|unknowingly sent it]] to Mike Matei, ''James Rolfe's on-screen partner'',instead. Mike, smelling the sweet scent of lulz, promptly posted it on the [http://www.screwattack.com/forum ScrewAttack forums]...

[[Image:Moreiratefailure.png|thumb|200px|Irate Gamer can't even double check his video descriptions.]]

{{squote|Hello James, 
I'm not sure if you know me but my name is Chris
Bores, I do the Irate Gamer 
videos on youtube.<br><br> 
I feel compelled to finally 
write you since my videos are 
starting to get popular on youtube and tons of 
people are comparing my 
quality of work to yours.<br><br> 
I don't know if 
you'll end up reading this because you 
probably get tons of emails in a day and I know 
mine would be swimming in the 
[[cum|sea]] of them, but I wanted to [[fuck|write]] you anyway.<br><br> 
Anyhow, I just wanted to let you know I've been a 
fan of your videos ever 
since I saw your Ninja Turtles game review around 
last year. And I gotta say, 
it was very inspiring to me. In fact, I hardly got 
any sleep that night 
because I had hundreds of new idea's flowing 
through my mind of what I could do 
with this intriguing thing you started. But due to 
my [[Beastiality|career]], I had to tuck them 
away for a few months until I could get some spare 
time to record them.<br><br> 
Now I'm not sure if you've ever seen any of my 
reviews or ever heard of me, 
or heck, even like me for that matter, but I just 
wanted to take some time 
out of my [[fapping|busy schedule]] and let you know I respect 
your work and I do try my 
hardest to not copy your material. Although in my 
earlier reviews, I will 
admit, that I accidentally used some of your [[obvious|well 
known made up words in my 
review]] and I only found this out because people 
were telling me I did. I felt 
really bad about it and still do because the [[lie|last 
thing I want to do]] is black person 
your catch phrases.<br><br> 
Since then, I made a point to 
watch all your reviews again 
and to make sure not to make that same blunder 
again. So if I ended up causing 
any negative feelings because of it, my apologies. 
But hey, I just wanted to email you and let you 
know I respect your work and 
clear the air of any [[hard]] feelings if there are 
any, because I'm just doing
this stuff for fun and I know you are too.<br><br> 
So thanks for everything, and I should mention, 
since day one I thought it 
would be neat to do a duel[sic] review with you, but 
I'm still trying to figure out 
[[rape|how getting both worlds to collide would work]]. 
Hmm Oh well, maybe one day. 
Thanks again my friend, and I'm glad to see you 
doing so well! 
<br>-Chris 
|The Irate Gamer, unknowingly confessing his plagiarizing to Mike Matei}}

Suffice it to say, shortly after Matei's posting, there were major [[butthurt|flame wars]] between the AVGN and Irate Gamer fanboys across ScrewAttack and Youtube, ending with ScrewAttack [[win|closing their forums]] for a day.


== Irate Gamer (The Freedom Fighter) Vs. AVGN (The Evil Oppressor) ==

Has Chris turned a new leaf and has began to fight for his fellow  [[Video_Game_Reviewers/List_of_Reviewers|video game reviewing]] comrades against the oppressive ''shit load of fucking'' might of James Rolfe and Mike Mattei?   

This [[Facebook]] interview with [[Alexander4488]] (another AVGN rip off) suggests so...

{{squote|I saw James at E3 and really did not care to go up and talk to him because I do not like the way him (sic) at  Mike Mattie treat other reviewers.<br>I think they take everyone else as a joke personally when in reality its supposed to be fun.

==Y2B Productions==

'''Y2B Productions''' ''(Yippie, 2 Bungholes)'' is the I[[rape|rate]] Gamers non-existent company that he uses to ban [[fags|Youtubers]] who expose his [[fail]] through parodies and satire.

Eventually, everyone caught on that Y2B was as [[pathetic|real]] as Irate [[Gay|Ga]]mer's gaming skills, but that didn't stop the fucking [[douchebag]] from banning other Youtubers because he is a [[YouTube]] [[whore|partner]].
[[Image:Y2B fail.jpg|center|thumb|The destruction of Y2B Productions Studios.]] [[Image:Iratetshirt.jpg|right|thumb|Buy my T-Shirts, BITCHES!!]] 
 
Y2B also distributes Irate Gamer [[shit|DVD's]], but because he's too [[retard|retarded]] to make a fake address and instead puts [[asking for it| his home address on]], anyone with [[Anonymous|half a brain]] can order the DVD and [[terrorism|send a letter-bomb to his house]].  
[[Image:houseirate.gif|left|thumb|Possible effects of sending a letter-bomb to Mr. Bores house.]]

==The conflict dies down, but don't tell the troops!==

For the most part, the conflict between IrateGamer and the AVGN has died down, as AVGN reviews every game related to every movie release, and IrateGamer complains about Contra, but that hasn't stopped their loyalist armies from creating mass drama and/or lulz. When the AVGN put out his Rambo video, his detractors immediately accused him of stealing material from several YouTube reviews of the same game. People who were denouncing IrateGamer for jacking material from AVGN were suddenly willing to give the AVGN the benefit of the doubt. Butts were hurt. Subscriptions were canceled. Trolls were fed. [[18-1|The Patriots lost the Super Bowl.]]

Today, a vicious cycle of trolling and butthurt continues to perpetuate despite the absence of actual conflict. Fans troll trolls, who then become trolls, who become trolled by other trolls before even MORE trolls troll the trolled. 

{{quote|"After watching him, viewing posts, and seeing all the haters out there, it seems to me that it really is a battle between Coke and Pepsi."|ScrewAttack User A}}

{{quote|"Coke and Pepsi are quality products and Pepsi is a rip off of Coke."|ScrewAttack User B}}

<center><youtube>AdA3z-Ql0Is</youtube></center>

Since their idols aren't trading [[Steve Irwin|barbs]] between each other, the armies have taken to fighting among themselves rather than sit and wait for more drama. Some highlights include:

*''Demenstar'' accusing ''PyramidHead97'' of ripping off the AVGN in a video parodying the Irate Gamer - The Nerd had a death montage in his Silver Surfer review, and in a video parodying the Irate Gamer's Contra video, PyramidHead87 did a death montage. So a video that would normally be supported by the AVGN camp is blamed because he did one small thing that Irate also did that AVGN also did...Wait, what the hell was I talking about again?
*''SlashManEXE'' accusing ''IrateGamerIsGod'' of ripping his opinions off another Irate Gamer fanboy.

If you ever have an epiphany and realize you're acting like an idiot on the internet, take solace in knowing that you couldn't do worse than these people.

For those keeping score, let's recap all the accusations by both camps, starting with:

===Concepts the Irate Gamer has been accused of stealing===

* AVGN's Concept for a show about doing Angry reviews of games. 
* AVGN's Back to the Future review.
* Stringing multiple swear words together like "Shitload of fuck".
* AVGN's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles review.
* "Destroying" video games (aka make them vanish with special effects).
* Posting video game posters on his backwall. 
* Selling a DVD of his work.
* Forgetting to remove copyrighted material from the aforementioned DVD.
* Having a mindless army of fanboys.
* Stealing the idea to use flames behind him in photos to make him seem "angry". You can see in AVGN's T-Shirt Ad on Youtube he did the flame backdrop first. 
* Ranting about stupid nonsensical [[shit nobody cares about]].
* Using guest stars in his videos, which was a concept started by AVGN. 

==Surge of /i/nsurgency==

With the prolonged effects of the [[Writers Guild of America strike (2007)|writer's strike]] and a lack of anything on television finally achieving cabin fever status among the Irate Fans (there STILL won't be any new television shows for a while), his legion has has gone to BUTTHURT-CON 1 and are attempting to expose the Angry Video Game Nerd as an evil ripoff. They are currently spamming each and every video on YouTube with a [[copypasta]] forced [[meme]] statement ordering them to pick up an internets gun and start shooting.

{{tinyquote|"Calling all Irate Gamer fans. I think its time we go to war against the AVGN and his AVGN Nazis. Anybody willing to fight this war send me a friend request. Everyone on my friends list will get detailed instructions on how to end the AVGNs reign of terror FOREVER!"|If they're all saying this, then who's giving the instructions?}}

{{tinyquote|"If your not for us or Irate Gamer your against us! You can't like both AVGN and IG, it's physically impossible! Also to those who say " If you don't like him don't watch him ". Absolutely not!! That's not good enough for us !!! We need AVGN, Armake21, BigAl2K6, and screwattackeurope banned. We are tired of being victims of their oppression!! We are taking a stand against their evil, tyrannical dictatorship. To all who oppose the Irate revolution be afraid, be very afraid. There is no neutrality in this war. Ally or enemy make your choice, either join us, get out of the way or be destroyed! See you on the battle field!"|VirginGamer69, 22 and nothing better to do.}}

Wait, if you get out of the way, doesn't that mean you're neutral?

In recent days the number of Nerd hate videos has reached [[over 9000]], each and every one of them filled with massive fail, featuring screencaps of the Nerd, and dubbed over with horrible synth voices; which try to be like [[Portal|GLaDOS]] but fail miserably, and most of which were recorded by sticking their microphone <s>up their asses</s> in front of their computer speakers, evidently too fucking stupid to figure out how to make [[YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG|SndRec32 record Audio Out]]. Seriously, this shit was groundbreaking...in fucking 1991.

===Lulz hits the fan===

The influx of Irate Gamer insurgency came to a head on February 26 2008, when [[Armake21]] released an 11 minute rant on YouTube flaming the Irate Gamer's [[irony|lack of creativity]] and his batshit insane fan base flooding the tubes and generally trying to make life hell for anybody else who reviews video games. Drama hit an all time high when the video was REMOVED from the intertubes, possibly due to A) Enough IrateGamer fans were butthurt by the video and YouTube pulled it because they were pissed off with the amount of flagging it was getting, B) The Irate Gamer himself used his 1337 Partner powers and had it yanked from the intertubes, or C) The profanity-laced video violated the YouTube Terms of Service, that and about four million other videos. Any attempt to re-upload the video results in '''Rejected (terms of use violation)'''. However, for some reason no one ever suspected Armake [[truth|deleted the video himself]] to feed the butthurt.

The aftermath was decisive, to say the least. People on the fence about liking or hating the Irate Gamer were shoved into the Hate Parade solely on the basis that now nobody is allowed to hate on him on YouTube. IrateGamer fans jumped ship and joined the AVGN bandwagon, if only because they can get their facts straight half the time. Among game reviewers, the Irate Gamer is now equated with the [[Church of Scientology]].

Fortunately, [[Armake21]] was kind enough to mirror [[shit nobody cares about|the original video]] to rapidshare.

==Epic Troll?==

[[Image:Igcomedian.gif|thumb|right|HE LIES!]]Given the large amount of epic trolls that have taken everyone by surprise such as [[Megan Had It Coming]], is it possible that the Irate Gamer has been attacking good games and generating much [[butthurt]] in the name of the [[did it for the lulz|lulz]]? Could it be that he got to be the [http://www.youtube.com/members?t=a&p=1&s=ms&g=2 12th most subscribed Comedian on YouTube] by trying to be funny instead of being [[serious business|srs]]?

Probably not. But then again, [[Last Thursday]] in his "Top 5 Worst Video Game Movies" movie, he slammed Final Fantasy 10, and even internet [[noobs]] know that bashing any final fantasy results in a lot of butthurt.

==The Irate Gamer Meme ''(Bores n' Doors)''==

[[Last Thursday]], in an amazing display of hypocrisy, a [[Christian]] [[faggot|stud muffin]] by the name of [[AkewsticRockR]] created quite possibly the only note-worthy cause in his entire life, a [[Meme]] about him knocking on Chris' door and making some sort of mildly amusing comment along the lines of his plagiarising or lack of talent.

*'''batdanm:''' Another failtroll dedicated to proving Irate Gamer is not a hack. He has been known for going onto many accounts, harassing others, stalking people by commenting on videos other people have commented on and leaving at least over 9,000 comments in a row, posting broken links of "proof" that AVGN is a plagiarist when in fact, it is the other way around. He has a list of people he's owned when ironically the only person he's owned is himself. His catchphrases are "lol" "u mad" and "You've bitched out." He's allegedly a homosexual due to his fascination of people being butthurt and writing detailed sentences of how butt hurt that person is. He also has a habit of changing his wallpaper when ever his feelings are hurt in an attempt to make fun of others, when really no one could care less. He has a little show called Video Game Guru's but it is not to be seen at the moment. [http://www.youtube.com/user/batdanm]

==Chris Bores <i>loves</i>,  sorry. SCAMS his fans==
Just when you thought he couldn't sink any lower, Chris is now scamming his fans with a fake giveaway.
<youtube>GVN_C3hcetg</youtube><youtube>qPdjTxqqxj8</youtube><youtube>bGeHcs-XwwI</youtube>

==Chris subscribed to himself, 100,000 times==
[[image:Irategetpwnedagain.png|thumb|right]]
On the 25th of August 2010, Chris's subscribers fell from ~121,000 to exactly 1337 within a day. It appears that several, as in A LOT of Chris's Sock Puppet accounts were being banned by YouTube staff. This is the reason he hid his Subscriber panel, and how Irate made all his money whilst doing fuck all [[IRL]]. Bot accounts = Moar views = [[Profit]]. Chris then went to [[v/|/v/]] to samefag and bawww about it, claiming it was just a script by someone to make his subscriber count go down. This was indeed bullshit and can't be proved since Chris would need to enable the display of subscribers on his channel.

Left with around <del>100</del>0 subscribers, Chris shat himself because of how YouTube pwned him. Even [http://www.youtube.com/user/IrritatedGamer a certain parody account] had more legit subs than him now.

As in Chris's words, "all good things must come to an end".

'''[[DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]'''. It was actually a script that exploited a YouTube counting bug. It became obvious once his subscribers hit 0. Or it could be that he is so bad nobody ever subscribed to him. Ever.
