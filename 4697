LOLCHAIR
[[Image:LOLchair.jpg|thumb|250px|The original.]]
'''LOLCHAIR''' (or '''HAPPYCHAIR''', '''SMILECHAIR''' to [[newfag]]s/'''GRINCHAIR''' to [[oldfags]]) is an interesting [[meme]] that was born [[last Thursday]] on [[B|/b/]], when [[Anonymous]] posted a picture of a chair for the lulz. Not much is known about LOLCHAIR other than the fact that it is already an [[old meme|dead meme]], leading some to believe that [[Miltopia]] had used it.

/v/ was reported to be in the making of a Lolchair [[flash]] game! It was scheduled to be finished by [[Last Thursday]], but they did not deliver.
