Haldir whore
[[image:Sailorfat.jpg|thumb|Do not look into its eyes; it only seeks to consume you]][[image:Biggestloser.jpg|thumb|Our newest contestant!]] AKA Tori-chan, according to her [[MySpace]], is some [[attention whore]] on the intarwebs who has has diagnosed herself with [[asperger's syndrome]]. She uses this to justify her penchant for posing as a [[fat]] [[Sailor Moon]] character (not to be confused with an [[ass pirate]]). Do not allow anywhere near food.

==Swears she looks like Sailor Uranus==
According to her myspace, "Yep! I'm an avid cosplayer. I dunno, everyone says I look like Haruka/Sailor Uranus from Sailor Moon." Hate to break it to you but [[friends|everyone]] is [[lie|lying]] to you. Also, like most [[wapanese]] she butchers the Japanese and Korean [[language]] mercilessly. Experts theorize that this is due to her [[Welfare whale|double chins]] restricting the movement near her mouth. She wants to form a [[JROCK|J-Rock]] band so she can be the [[emo|screamer]] like [[shit nobody cares about|Tatsurou or Kyo or Gacchan.]]

== The Trolling ==
[[Image:Cottagecheese.jpg||thumb|It's never a bad time for product placement]]Upon discovery of this [[LJ]], members of [[#ed]] immediately created comments such as the ever-hilarious, "KILL IT WITH EXERCISE." Also, some trolls photoshopped the disgusting images, which spawned even more [[lulz]]. Haldir's internet girlfriend, Myztic_Beauty, an equally repulsive cosplay freak, defended Haldir to the death, telling the trolls that they were cruel and evil for doing what they did and, get this, that they needed to get a life. LOL.

==Fun Facts==

*She's [[bisexual|bi]].
*She's currently in a [[girlfriend|relationship.]]
*And she's the only serious [[gamer|gamer]] in [[shit nobody cares about|Clarksville]].
