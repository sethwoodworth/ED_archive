WikiHow
[[Image:Howdoishotweb.jpg|thumb|wikiHow's article on how to [[How Do I Shot Web?|shot web]] has, unfortunately, been deleted several times. [http://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=&page=Shot+Web] [http://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=&page=Shot+web]  Guess we'll never know the secret.]]

[http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page WikiHow], the bastard child of [[Wikipedia]] and [[Yahoo Answers]], is a [[wiki]] whose purpose is to provide reference style descriptions and instructions on how to do various things.  Unfortunately, wikiHow does not actually contain any useful articles (all interesting or semi-useful entries get [[Criteria for Speedy Deletion|speedily deleted]]), but is rather full of [[obvious]] information like [http://www.wikihow.com/Eat-Cherries how to eat a cherry] or [http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Sandwich how to make a sandwich].

The [[1337|elite]] few who do know how to do such complex tasks as [http://www.wikihow.com/Ring-a-Doorbell ring a doorbell] write really nice articles about how to do it so that you (you, obviously being an uneducated fool deprived throughout life of even the simplest knowledge of human culture) will know, too.

== History ==
wikiHow editing originally became popular [[at_least_100_years_ago|about 100 years ago]] (in wikiTime), when it became clear that the website was not going to create itself and was going to require a large amount of volunteer labor.  Common games played were giving awards to people for making one or two nice articles, congratulating people for contributing [[vandalism]] to the site, and giving forum parties to people who had made a couple dozen edits.

One 20th July 2009, a bunch of [[/b/|idiots]] decided to raid the religious part of wikihow and spam it with [[Mudkipz]] and [[Goatse]] in another [[fail|attempt]] [[I did it for the lulz|to restore their former glory]].

Never really attaining its goal of being a catalog of helpful step-by-step guides and how-to knowledge, wikiHow has settled into the only niches that its editors can fill; pointless bullshit, terrible [[Video games|video-game]] tips, and [[TOOW|random nonsense]] that nobody's ever going to need.  So in addition to those invaluable guides on [http://www.wikihow.com/Eat-Cheese how to eat cheese], expect a lot of articles with titles such as "HOw 2 pWn teH n00bz in Halo LOLZ!"  Oh wait... actually, there really are multiple articles on that.
