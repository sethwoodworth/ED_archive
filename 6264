'''''Parappa The Raper''''', brother of Chester the molester, is a video game created [[at least 100 years ago]], which [[some argue]] created the trend in [[DDR|homosexual rave parties]]. The game stars an [[You|asian nigger dog]] who wants to get revenge on [[Soulja Boy]] by defeating him in a rap battle. Typical levels include being taught to rap by [[LOL WUT|food items]], shooting up a rival hood, taking paternity tests on [[Maury]], eating fried [[chicken]] and watermelon, dodging child support and coercing [[Whores|white women]] into sex. Surprisingly, the game was actually co-created by an American who [[retard|likes Japan]], [http://www.whimsyload.com/info.items/bio.html no fucking joke]. The game also contains [http://content.ytmnd.com/content/2/f/f/2ff21047fb7ee58737f1c91ff287d982.mp3 satanic messages].

==Typical levels==
Notice how each level includes a total fucking faggot in the background?

==The Gameplay==

[[Pimp my ride|YO DAWG I HERD U LIKE PRESSIN BUTTANS. SO I DUN PUT A BUTTAN ON UR BUTTAN, SO U CAN MASH WHILST U MASH]]

Tl;dr: THERE FUCKEN IS NONE.

At a stretch, Nostalgia [[fags]] could point out that Parappa was one of the first msuic based video games, and spawned the trend for future musical video games, such as [[DDR]] or [[Fail|Rock band]]. Thick rose-tinted goggles required.

Punch in the on-screen button prompts in time with the beat and rhythm. mess this up and your rating goes down. Perform well in this task ( Ain't exactly rocket science ) and your rating will increase 

Fail the [[queer]] Hairdressing octopus' mission and have your nightmares haunted by his twisted face for your entire childhood. Quite the selling point, i think you'll agree.

=="Important" Characters==
*'''[[Rap|PaRappa the Rapper]]''' - The [[Fag|hero]] of the game, trying to survive life in the ghetto, He motivates himself out of problems with his catchphrase, "[[Naruto|I Gotta Believe!]]"
*'''Sunny Funny''' - A giant talking flower who generally has a [[Drugs|cheery disposition]]. She appears to have a [[scat|shit]] fetish, as evidenced by her starring in this game.
*'''PJ Berri''' - [[you|A lazy bear who adds nothing to the plot]]. He works as a DJ at Club Fun, The Local [[gay]] bar
*'''[[Lolcat|Katy Kat]]''' - One of Parappa's background dancers who shakes her ass while Parappa raps about ghetto life.
*'''[[Rock|Um jammer lammy]]''' - Female gitaurist and former memeber of [[dragonforce]]. She got her videogame, as detailed below, and was by far the most popular character in the game.
*'''[[White|Joe Chin]]''' - A pompous rich motherfucker who could pay to have you killed if he wanted. Easily the most [[hardcore]] character in this game
*'''PaRappa Papa''' - PaRappa's bitch father, whose gets his car jacked by niggers, and destroyed.
*'''Ma San''' - NO ONE CARES!

==Um Crapper Lammy==
This was a spinoff to the original Parappa game, in which some charecter noone cares about has a dream where Vegetable Man shows her that through the power of [[drugs]], anything could be a guitar. She then has to get to her concert in time so she could spread her musical [[AIDS]] throughout the world. The problem is, there is a whole bunch of people trying to stop her from making it there. They include a guy who sets a pizza place on fire and makes her put it out, a worm who babysits and has constant [[Roman Showers]] (NOW PUT THESE KIDS TO SLEEP WILL YA), an airplane pilot who Lammy constantly hits with a bat making him go from a senile old man to a crazy guy, a beaver who HAETS JOE CHIN'S CHAINS, some bitch from hell and finally the concert itself. [[shit nobody cares about|You can play as Parappa,but his storyline has no connection to the stages.]]

==Parappa 2: [[Electric Boogaloo]]==
Last Thursday, everyone's favorite rapist returns, only this time he has to find out why everything is turning into [[Ramen]]and get his [[bitch]] back, because she called him a pussy faggot when he wouldn't eat her noodle shit. Parappa now has to stand some ghost who makes him go to the kitchen, Vegetable Man who tries to make him gay through a show about [[wat|"Romantic Comedy"]] (but only manages to make him bisexual), an ant who thinks he's god, [[OC|the sister of that bitch who gave you your driving liscence in his first game]], some apeshit octupus, a...Video game?, a guy who can't tell noodles from cocks (official quote from game: "Slurp it, suck it, I know you all like it") and some guy noone gives a shit about. Then you get your bitch back and the game is over. Yeah, it's not like the homeless need the money you spent on the game as a donation. They got enough money already.
