[[Image:B b.jpg|thumb|330px|StrawberryClock's B, arguably the best movie ever made.]]
'''[http://www.clockcrew.cc The Clock Crew]''' is a group of [[flame|flaming]] [[homosexual|homosexuals]] originating from the [[Internets]] cesspool [[Newgrounds]]. [[At least 100 years ago]], a [[Newgrounds]] user by the name of StrawberryClock submitted an epic [[Flash]] animation entitled A. Unfortunately the symbolic significance of the film went directly over the heads of [[Newgrounds]]' native [[13 year old boys]], and it was removed from the website. StrawberryClock followed up A with [[B]], which was similarly epic and rich in symbolism, and to the horror of [[13 year old boys]] worldwide, it was preserved via the grace of [[God]], obtained through several hours of holy [[fellatio]].  The Clock Crew is one of the few things on Newgrounds that is even remotely funny.

The preservation of [[B]] allowed it time to be appreciated by those endowed with [[mega ultra super genius]]. and so [[B]] was followed up with, among other things, such masterpieces as [[Cat|C]], D, [[E]], [[F]], [[G]], [[H]], [[I]], J, [[K]], [[L]], M, [[N]], O, P, Q, R, S, T, [[U]], [[V]], [[W]], [[X]], [[Y]], Z, and a remake of A. Without Clock Crew movies such as these, our small [[world]] would be [[nothing|NOTHING]].

Of course, when the faggots of Newgrounds started bitching about B a few rose up from the fetid hole in defense of the spam. These were AppleClock, RaspberryClock, and OrangeClock. These three formed the animation/spam group known as the Clock Crew, which has spent most of its existence [[trolling]] and [[Spam|spamming]] [[Newgrounds]].

With the emergence of the Clock Crew, StrawberryClock [[Unwarranted self-importance|laid claim to the Newgrounds Portal as his domain]], hence the CC saying “Welcome, we run Newgrounds.” This infuriated many of the gay boys of Newgrounds, starting the Anti-Clock movement. 

As the CC expanded, so did the Anti-Clock movement, which spent their time making cartoons depicting the Clocks being brutally murdered, executed, and generally reacting to cheap spam the way 13-year old boys do. The CC responded with love and affection, which served to further enrage the Anti-Clocks (because the CC cartoons were pushing crude hentai games and porn slideshows off the portal). Furious, it caused the divide between [[furries|Clock-Lovers]] and [[Otherkin|Clock-Haters]] in the shit-pit to expand, creating a polarization of the [[13-year-old boys|Newgrounds audience]] that exists to this day.

The Clock Crew once prided itself on the hateful reviews it got from the [[Newgrounds]] usergroup, but sadly, because of the new whistle system, and the [[faggotry]] of review mods, some priceless pieces of internet history have been lost forever.

Notable amongst the lost reviews are those of the most famous of Anti-Clocks: ki1o. His reviews (lost forever) spawned a trend within CC cartoons, showing him as a [[fag|faggoty]] villain who wants to control the [[Newgrounds]] portal. LeafClock claims to be the former ki1o, having been [[rape|“brought to the light”]] by KnottsberryClock’s [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/45145 The Portal is not Enough]. This statement has yet to actually be confirmed.

== Current State Of Affairs ==
[[Image:Isionspost1.png|thumb|Average Clockcrew Post]]
But being the bastard child of a gaping shithole in internet like [[Newgrounds]], the Clock Crew too is filled with [[faggotry]]. Currently the CC is filled with [[weeaboos]], [[Gaia Online|gaiafags]], and pretentious art queers. Not to mention the mods are extremely butthurt and you will be banned instantly if you say something funny or try to fit logic into something.

'''Clock Crew Staff'''
* LeekClock – Seems like a swell enough fellow at first glance, but he is really an impotent [[crap|coprophiliac]], Dutch cuntbag, and suspected [[babyfur]]. He and SoupClock (another coprophiliac) started a massive animation project called The Runs, which flooded the portal with cartoons related to farts, poo-poos, and the like. Also Leek has terrible teeth. One time he went out to spread [[rape|“Clock Love”]] in the streets of Dublin in a homemade SBC [[fursuit]] (although technically not a fursuit, it comes pretty damn close). [[Pedophile|He likes to touch little boys]] and his mother has swamp-crotch. More on Leek can be found [http://www.clockcrew.cc/talk/showthread.php?t=49279 here].

* TreeClock – A ban-happy, [[wapanese]] douche with a One Piece obsession. He also has an overwhelming hatred of puppies and spends a good deal of his time beating them when not fapping to One Piece fan-dubs on youtube. 

* RenegadeClock – A twofaced [[basement-dweller]] with only one redeeming quality: his fanatical hatred of [[Foamy]] and IllWillPress. Also a suspected [[babyfur]].

* SageClock – A sad excuse of a man who spends a great deal of his time making crappy games and rambling on about things no one else cares about. Other than that his pastimes include arguing with [[13-year-old boys]] over videogames and consoles, and getting new members to e-fellate him.

* SlurpeeClock – A [[gay]] boy who smells of processed beef and venison, a trait that runs in his family. This day-old meat smell is why he and his family are occasionally attacked by wolves and terrorists. [[Lies|He denies the accusation that he is a furry]], and will [[ban]] you for even contemplating the thought of calling him on his disgusting [[fetish]] for [[Krystal]].

* GoldenClock – E-Badass who has been [[Spam|spamming]] the Clock Crew for years. Many CC members mistake his [[trolling]] as the antics of a senior member, when it is just his incredible e-acting. Golden is currently [[Google]] searching for pics of [[gay]] men.

* CraisinClock – Resembles a shriveled black person testicle. Doesn’t do much.

* SoupClock – A [[shit]]-loving [[fag]] who enjoys making [[Newgrounds|crappy animations]]. Not only did he orchestrate The Runs, but before joining the Clock Crew he and a fellow shit-fag started a group to celebrate their [[Crap|coprophilia]]. After his feces-lover group [[Fail|went under]], he found fellow shit-lovers in the CC. He and Leek give each other [[rimjob|rimjobs]] daily.

* AbsintheClock – [[Art]] fag who has an [[Fetish|unhealthy obsession]] with Salvador Dali. Does anything more really need to be said?

* AlbinoClock – Spends most of his time in the [[Irony|Debate Forum]]. He [[ban]]s anyone who doesn’t back up what they say with links (i.e. every sentence). [[The Internet is serious business|He takes the internet very seriously]], each banning or argument won inflating his [[e-go]]. He also does a shitload of [[Jenkem|drugs]].

* MonkeyClock (aka Munglai) - A teenage boy who is out of it most of the time, and occasionally stops by the boards to post pics of himself with facepaint and to tell people their ideas are dumb. He also has a habit of making polls such as "Who would win in a fight: a man with a ballpoint pen, or a hyena on a segway?" Sometimes, when feeling [[Drug|really creative]] he will creat a little text adventure about some celebrity he likes. Examples: [http://www.clockcrew.cc/talk/showthread.php?t=30282 MorganQuest 64] and [http://www.clockcrew.cc/talk/showthread.php?t=52879 Keith Richards' Detective Adventure]

* VirusClock – Don’t trust him. He’s managed to [[Lies|convince everyone]] in the CC that he is a [[Gay|great guy]], but he’s really trying to lure them into a false sense of security. He plans on meeting them all [[IRL]], inviting them to his house, and feeding them to his mother’s wailing, carnivorous [[cunt]].

* SilvercherryClock – A [[13-year-old boy]] from [[Newgrounds]] with [[Retard|mod powers]].

*ClamClock - Hate filled oldbie that has actually walked through the atlantic ocean in order to rape the dog of a brit who called him a faggot over IRC. Often calls others faggots to cover up his own homosexual tendencies.

* Losperman – [[Butthurt]] faggot, no one cares if you're portrayed in a positive light. [http://www.clockcrew.cc/talk/showpost.php?p=1061831&postcount=1 Obviously seeking attn from his peers] due to his [[Oedipus]] Complex.

* DurianClock - Some asshole who's never online, it's anyone's guess as to how he became a mod. He's also a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] [[cunt]] who faps to his old yearbook photos.

* Biggskoo - A [[wigger]] and [[internet tough guy]] who used to spend a lot of time playing [[Star Wars|Star Wars Galaxies]] and consuming large amounts of purple liquid. 

* ArchonClock - Allegedly the one crew member with an IQ of [[over 9000]], this guy lacks any sort of sense of humor. Seeing the Clock Crew's spam as some form of [[Bullshit|artistic Absurdism]], he goes out of his way to make longwinded [[Serious_business|rants]] to anyone not strictly following his views. He too is dutch, and loves [[LARP]] and [[13-year-old boy|Little boys]]. Rumored to be using the Clock Crew to gain [[Hitler|world domination]].

* Zombie Lincoln – A shitty animator and wannabe historian. His [[Necrophilia|sexual attraction]] to [[Abraham Lincoln]] has led to a [[Unwarranted self-importance|bizarre delusion that he is Lincoln brought back from the dead]]. He is also a shit writer and philosopher. And like the philosophers of old he has an unhealthy addiction to little boys, which he blames on the premature death of “his” son. He is also the nemesis of another CC member, DWARFINATORClock. Their battles epic are recorded in the [http://www.clockcrew.cc/talk/forumdisplay.php?f=43 CC archives].
