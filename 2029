Danish
'''Danish''' is a word used to describe the extraordinarily [[Norwegian|g]][[Swedish|a]][[Finnish|y]] people and national [[language]] of [[Denmark]]. The Danish people call themselves Danes and they love "working" [[Hard Gay|hard]]. 

Danes suffer from the delusion that they are more civilized than the rest of the world. They all come across as nice people but deep down inside they are a society of hard-gay [[rapists]] with a desire to rid the world of women.
