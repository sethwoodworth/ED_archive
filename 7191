'''Sage Freehaven''', born July 25, 1981, has been in the [[furry]] community/fandom since late 2001. He was the administrator of [[fchan]] from February 2005 to June 2005, after which Sage Nadia took over administration duties due to Sage's indulgence of his desire to [[anal sex|anally violate]] dogs on a regular basis.

Sage is a regular poster on [[4chan]]; he is a regular poster on /co/ and /tv/, despite everyone's best efforts to get him to leave; and thinks himself a clever [[troll]] on [[/b/]], sometimes going so far as to [[attention whore|post his own picture and call for other /b/tards to troll him]].

He can often be found on The Raised Tails Cafe channel on FurNet, is a member of the Furry Wrestling Alliance roleplaying group, and is a semi-regular source of irritation on WTFux and WTFur/Lulz.net, and the [[CrushYiffDestroy]] forums. He is also notorious for his [[masturbation|love]] of the characters [[insane|Squirrel Girl]], [[pedophile|Gadget Hackwrench]] and [[bestiality|Minerva Mink]].

He is also the founder of the The International Order of Gadgephiles, where he posts under his real name, Stephen Todd Stone. Freehaven himself is bisexual and is currently unemployed, still attending community college.

== Fursona ==
Sage's furry alter-ego is an anthro wolf with grey fur, brown hair, and green eyes. His three meter-long penises throb when he watches Rescue Rangers.

==Cancer on the Chans==
What is it with people? Why do they always want to be where nobody wants them? Seriously.

If you see a [[furry]] on [[4chan|our glorious paradise]], keep yelling at them to [[GTFO|GTFO 4CHAN]] [[furry|FURFAG]]. This holy mantra, passed down by generations of [[Al Gore|Totally Cereal Furry Hunters]], will destroy their [[suicide|will to live]] and banish them back to the [[hell|luminiferious aether]].

Sage Freehaven is also known to spam [[Furfag|furfaggotry]] on /i/ boards, in an attempt to stop raids on fellow furries. Despite his urges to attempt raids on chans, he has kissed Kirtaner's ass to the point where he's become a mod on the /wooo/ board on [[420_chan|420chan]]. The wrestling board which totally has nothing to do with his gay sexual orientation, or that Furry Wrestling Alliance roleplaying group of his, really.

He's also admin of his own [http://dammitfreehaven.com/ board], along with his [[Sockpuppet|sister]] Sechs Fuckheaven, where he often sucks [[Eric Schwartz]]'s dick.

<b>It's also important to know that he constantly invites furries from [http://lulz.net/ lulz.net] (a furry yiff-porn imageboard) to [[420_chan|420chan]], possibly doubling the number of [[Anti-lulz|lulzkillers]] in their /i/ board. </b>
