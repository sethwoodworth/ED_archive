'''Starblade''' ([[Powerword]]: '''Mathew Finnigan''' - ? ??, 1984 to September 22, 2010) was a 26 year old [[America]]n male LJ user who believed that '''HE''' was a ''female'' dragon. He suffered from [[Asperger's Syndrome]] and was [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]], having no ability to differentiate between reality and fiction. He was also a [[voraphile]], [[pregnophile]], [[otherkin]], [[furry]], and [[plushie]] lover, and drew terrible [[fan art]] which he posted on [[Elfwood]]. Like many insane gay furries, Starblade was also an [[Ayn Rand|Objectivist]]. And he was into defiling [[video games]] by placing them in his <strike>anus</strike> username.

==The Beginning==
Originally from a voraphile chat, Starblade soon [[goatse|spread]] like a pandemic disease to a [[MMORPG|MUD]] called Alfandria, where he indulged his many fetishes and garnered [[at least 100]] [[E (prefix)|e]]Boyfriends, all of which he promptly lost in a matter of months because he refused to stop obsessing over Palshife. His manipulative behavior and constant whining about Palshife earned him a public stoning, whereupon he fled on the [[Waaaambulance|waaambulance]] from Alfandria with his astral tail tucked between his legs.

Starblade became affiliated with the online (IRC, Forums etc) [[Draconic]] community in the first half of 2002, who attempted to gain a foothold in the IRC created project known as Dracogenesis,  which contained a collection of computer programmers, who wanted to [[LOL WUT|create a retrovirus that was designed to turn them all into dragons]].  His only contribution to either the project itself or the [[Draconic]] community has appeared to be nothing more than foolish, depressing role-play that ended in unnecessary drama, and his departure from that community.

==The Journal Years==
[[Image:Starblade.jpg|thumb|right|With a face like that, you'd rely on [[rape|surprise sex]] too.]]
{{quote|[[FYIAD|You're just pissed because I totally dissed on you for being a total dragonslut, Palshifter.]]|Starblade Riven Darksquall}}
Months later he showed up on [[LiveJournal]] where he spent most of his time writing [[TL;DR]] posts about [[shit nobody cares about]] and [[Palshife]].

Starblade first came to the attention of many LJ users when he made several posts in [[debate]] on the topic of furryism and being a dragon.  It is from these posting that the acronym "[[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|FYIAD]]" was born.

==When Aspies Go Missing==
After making a series of mysterious and cryptic posts in May of 2004, he disappeared. Many speculated as to what happened to Starbles. Some believed he was arrested, others believed he was [[:Category: Abnormal Psych|committed]] for his dragon fantasies and his obsessive eStalking of Palshife, while still others believed he was [[death|dead]]. It was agreed upon, however, that he could not have possibly have left the [[Internets]] of his own volition.

It was discovered that he paid someone who he thought was Palshife to come from Ohio to have [[anal sex]] with him; it turned out to be another pregnovorazoophile friend of his. His promise to "leave the Internet" was enforced by [[Dive|a cruel dominatrix master]].

===Mysterious Reappearance===
A few months later, Starbles re-appeared as '''ZeroYellowYoshi''', and later still as '''Starbles'''. This can be expected to change on a monthly basis as people ferret him out. Currently he has a [[friends only]] journal, but occasionally makes public postings. None of them are very interesting and still contain his unique [[Stream of Consciousness|stream of consciousness]] style of writing.

==Death==
Starblade was eventually [http://www.thecalifornian.com/article/20100923/NEWS09/9230306/Monterey-man-arrested-in-friend-s-stabbing-death stabbed to death on September 22, 2010] [http://www.thecalifornian.com/article/20100924/NEWS01/9240328/Monterey-man-pleads-not-guilty-in-friend-s-death by a friend of his] called "James Torrey Hill", who's [[facebook]] is <s>[http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000699897463 here]</s> BALEETED. The homicidal [[asshole]] (and dragonslayer) was later arrested and faced a trial in court on September 29. Hill's fate is currently unknown.<br>
