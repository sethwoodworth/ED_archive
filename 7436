{{rainbowsmall|YOU CAN SHAVE THE BABY}}

You Can Shave the Baby is a [[Weird|Progressive Art]] piece from the independent Art Space [[sick fucks| Raster]], located in Warsaw. While these images may invoke feelings of utter wrongness in those who are not artists, for the people of Raster, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Other Raster masterpieces include:

* Lego Concentration Camp - The [[Jews]] are played by smiling skeletons from the Lego "Pirate" set
* A sketch of a naked woman/[[CP|girl]] farting
* [[Transsexual|Trannie Photography]]
* Photos of a naked Hermaphrodite
