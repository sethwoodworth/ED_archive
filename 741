==Chris Stokes <s>Apologizes</s> denies everything==
{{quote|The accusations that Demario “Raz B” Thorton and Ricardo Thorton have made are vehemently [[fact|false]] and hold no merit.  I have recently stopped financially supporting both individuals along with assisting them with their criminal and legal matters which leads me to believe they are resentful and looking to benefit financially from this.  My family is my first priority and the reason why I have been so supportive of them.  In bringing these false claims, they have not only slandered me, they have also put me in a position to ensure that the truth is known and I will take all legal routes to protect myself, my family and my four children. It’s also quite ironic that these statements were made only 2 weeks after they were denied admittance by a venue for an event I hosted in Beverly Hills|Chris Stokes explains why straight dudes that would admit to getting raped in the ass}}
