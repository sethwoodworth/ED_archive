'''Bellaboo''' (no relation to ''[[Twilight]]'') is the self-given nickname of Isabella Miller-Eberlin, an internet famous [[attention whore]], well known for her psychotic breaks and scams. Isabella got her start on the Dr. Phil show, on an episode about uncontrollable rage (see below for links). It was shocking to see a grown woman act like such a violent brat in front of her then five year old son, but everyone soon forgot about her mediocrity. That is, until her Etsy antics.

==Isabella Returns==
[[Etsy]] has been called the [[eBay]] of crafts. It is an online venue where people can buy and sell handmade and vintage items. Isabella opened a shop called Bella's Beauty and More [[BALEETED]] and began selling bath products and dog treats (who WOULDN'T want to buy those two items from the same person!?). All was good and well until she asked GimpyVicki123 to knit her a custom uterus (since hers had long ago rotted out). She scammed GimpyVicki123 out of part of her payment, and even though she had the benefit of inserting her new functional knitted uterus, proceeded to leave rambling [[bullshit]] negative feedback. 

{{quote|"Unfortunately,I would not recommend this seller at all. She did not make at all what I was looking for,not even close,and I had it very clear in my alchemy. Also, it was not finished by the deadline,and I got no word when it would be. I'm gone for a couple days,and return to find a half dozen e-mails from this wack,all upset that the remaining 10 bucks hasn't been paid yet. This is two days after she said it was completed, (I wasn't even aware that it was till I got back. I have sterling track record as a customer. Never once have I not promptly made payment,this seller does have other negatives,from people saying that she did not create what they were looking for either. Buy from her, and she won't give you 5 minutes to pay your bill, once she finishes, and God forbid you have to be called out of town for a family emergency or something for a few days....not to mention the fact that she does not create what you asked for,that she agreed to,and did not finish on time. I regretfully have to say,a VERY NEGATIVE experience with this seller,and I would definitely NOT recommend by any means! She is not only very rude,and unprofessional,but did not create what she said she would......BEWARE."| BellasBeautyandMore}} 

[[File:Bellashopannouncement.jpg|thumb|Major psychotic break.]]

The people of the [[interwebs]] staged a rebellion and began to purchase rampantly from GimpyVicki123 to show their support. This drew attention to Isabella's Etsy shop, which had been discovered to be full of stolen pictures of other sellers' products, claiming them to be her own. She ignored all requests to remove the images. This made her a [[whore|hated]] villain within still a relatively small group of people. However, Isabella refused to be ignored - she was destined to become one of the most hated people of the [[interwebs]]. She slandered her own name via her Etsy store, by declaring herself to be a scam artist (see photo). Regretsy (a site dedicated to mocking the [[shit]] people put on Etsy, and truly deserving of its own article) quickly screen capped the madness. She'd made a request for someone to make her a fake diploma with her name on it (which by the way is ILLEGAL), claiming it was a joke (don't worry, she made the SAME request on another site, see links). 

==Infiltration of the Internet==
BellaBooandCharlieToo is an eBay account that she quickly opened so she could "benefit" from all that stolen money like she promised to in her shop announcement. She bought tons of [[fugly]] clothing, a giant $300 teddy bear, retarded mini trampoline, dog chews, a Suspiria DVD, an LCD panel TV, and a private purchase from a store that ONLY sells "enhancing" devices (fake boobs, butt, etc.) When she ran out of money, she began a website called Bella Boo and Charlie Too (Charlie is, unfortunately, unlucky enough to be her son). She used the same stolen images and some random [[Google]]d pics of dogs in the hopes of scamming yet even more people. When this failed, she started putting [[shit]] up on Craig's list. Since she can't make anything and everyone knows it, she resorted to abusing animals by breeding dogs that should not be bred together, and quickly listing them for sale. Despite warnings from other concerned users - she also doesn't know anything about animal breeding, but will do [[stripper|anything]] to make a quick buck (see the links section for her stripper resume). 

[[File:Bellacream.jpg|left|thumb|It's too late to cover your ass, but nice try.]]
In a failed attempt to cover her ass, she submitted a message claiming that all of her psychotic bitch antics were a [[joke]]. She admits that she's a selfish [[whore]] that didn't think about how her son would be affected after learning his mother is a [[cunt]], and declares that her son thinks the world rises and sets on her (newsflash: MOST kids think that of their parents, you're not [[special]]). She sold out to get some air time because she can't stop being an [[attention whore]], and now claims that her [[rage]] was fake, and just for TV. She thinks it's sad that people believed it was real (not realizing of course, what she's saying about herself here: that she'd be willing to fake being mentally disturbed for fame). Also, even IF she really did fake her [[rage]] for Dr. Phil, how does that explain her stripper resume, online scams, and general [[skank]]y behavior? It doesn't.
