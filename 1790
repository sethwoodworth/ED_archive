[[Cory Kennedy]], or '''Cory Kennedy-Levin''' is a [[16 year old girl]] who made a burlesque out of herself on the internet.

Her e-fame came after Kennedy met a photographer crack head Jew at a concert at the El Rey Theatre in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] in [[2005]]. He took some photographs of her for his web site and fucked. The crack head posted photos of Kennedy with the title "JFK CORY KENNEDY", and no one cared until Cory claimed she was Kennedy. 

Eventually, she was being paid by high-profile nightclubs to show up with her friends and be seen, despite being only 16 years old (the legal drinking age in California is 21), and hanging out with celebrities such as [[Paris Hilton]] and Lindsay "Fire Crotch" Lohan.

Her parents had known about her exposure online, but had not realized the extent to which it had grown until the June issue of Nylon appeared. Because Kennedy had been previously treated for clinical [[depression]], their primary concern had been her health and well-being. By September 2006, her celebrity life began to conflict with her home and school life. 

Having had enough with her bullshit, her parents had her placed in a boarding school, a "nonpublic therapeutic placement" with limited phone and [[computer]] use, although she is free to leave on weekends. Since then, her [[internets]] profile has slightly lessened, but she is still making appearances in glossy fashion magazines.

Currently, Cory hangs with Scientologists. She goes along with other members of the dumbfuck [[Lolscenequeens]] club for being known for doing absolutely nothing like a [[dipshit]] and somehow gaining popularity.

Popular amongst hillbillies from Buttfuck, [[Ohio]] and weird foreigners.
