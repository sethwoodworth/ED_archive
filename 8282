'''The Peckham Terminator''' is the monicker given to one of the colourful inhabitants of the upmarket London district of the same name who, in early August 2010, was caught on Youtube having a lively discourse with a couple of [[niggers|gentlemen of colour]] at the back of a bus.

If the internets have taught us anything it's that ethnic altercations + public transport is a sure formula for the lulz, and sure enough, around three and a half minutes into the video he exits - stage right - straight through the glass door of the bus. He walks off entirely unscathed, leaving a comedy Wile E. Coyote style person-shaped hole in the door behind him.
