== About TFLN==
Texts From Last Night is a convenient website where one can easily upload drunken/stoned/otherwise mentally incapacitated text messages received from friends and family alike for all of the internet to see.  So say your best friend texts you at 3 AM to tell you that he was having [[buttsex|sex in the butt]] with a fat chick and got his dick sharted on.  Boom, instant TFLN material.  The beauty of TFLN is that while there are some sober thoughts mixed in the archives, the majority of the texts are from people who were too drunk to realize that it's [[PROTIP|probably not a good idea to tell anyone you masturbate to Star Trek porn]].  [[Fact|But that's what friends are for, right?]]

TFLN is fueled entirely by alcoholic college students who feel the need to post about their drunken escapades online so other people can <s>relate to</s> [[Irony|look down upon them condescendingly despite the fact that they have four drunk texts of their own uploaded on the site]].  Most Texts From Last Night will end up on a [[Failbook]] wall one way or another, whether it be by the person who sent the actual text looking to [[pretty cool guy|show off how cool they are]], or posted by one friend to another friend's wall as a means of subtly telling the world that they too suffer from [[erectile dysfunction]] when hooking up with their old middle school teacher. The website is also a favorite of [[basement dwellers]], most likely because it gives them insight into a life they could only dream of,[[Oh baby| a world where college girls get coked up and run around parties naked from the waist down pissing themselves]].
