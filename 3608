Hanukkah
'''Hanukkah''' aka [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER|חֲנֻכָּה‎]] is a special holiday that is celebrated by all the [[Jews]] in the world. They say that it is to celebrate how they escaped persecution from the [[Egyptian]]s or persecution from the [[Nazis]] or something about burning candles [[Seinfeld|yada yada yada]], but the truth is that when [[Christmas]] was invented, the Jews were feeling jealous and left out that they don't get a holiday celebrating their [[money|beliefs]] or getting presents. Thus, [[Oh noes|Hanukkah was born]]! Every Jew will tell you Hanukkah is different from all the other holidays, but in reality it's just a knock-off mix-fusion of [[Christmas]] and [[Kwanzaa]]. ''Hanukkah'' in their language means "[[rape|dedication]]."

==What it's all about==
Hanukkah is celebrated by lighting their <s>stolen [[Kwanzaa]] "Kinara"</s> [[Jewish]] "Menorah." They light just 1 candle on that thing every night for 8 days. It starts when the [[Sun]] sets instead of morning because they are [[vampires|more active at night]]. On the last day, when the 8th candle is lit, it turns into Christmas by having a big dinner with tons of family, Caroling, blowing out the candles to make a wish, and opening presents. They also try to set a world record by letting the candles burn out by themselves and hope that their [[house]] doesn't catch on [[fire]]. During the 8 days, the Jews complain about a lot of things such as how there is only a Christmas tree in the airport and not their cute looking candles. There is a proven [[fact]] that they celebrate Hanukkah to remember that they did [[9/11]] and the [[lollercaust]]. Any Jew you ask will [[lie]] and say that it is celebrated because they were able to run away from YET ANOTHER oppressive force that was smashing them down due to their [[religion]]. Jewfags use it as excuse to stay home from [[school]] or work for a week.

==Songs of Hanukkah==
There are a very little number of songs that the Jews sing. They are usually sung while they are lighting their [[magic]] candles. One of them is "[[moonspeak|Hanerot Hallalu]]" which they chant often to drive the spirits of [[Muslims]] and [[Hitler]] away. Another one is "Rock of Ages" where they sing that Jews invented Rock n' Roll.
