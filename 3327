Giggy
{{eduser}}

'''Giggy''' is a [[MySpace]] socializing editor on [[Wikipedia]], and a wannabe member of [[LaraLove]]'s Aussie [[bathrobe cabal|sex slave]]s.

He has [[at least 100]] [[featured article]]s, mostly on albums by the obscure [[Australia]]n band Powderfinger, that needless to say [[nobody cares]] about. Ironically while [[Featured article]]s are supposed to showcase the best of Wikipedia, the spamming of the [[Main Page]] with Powderfinger related bullshit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Main_Page&diff=170909052&oldid=170908946#Powderfinger has pissed people off to no end].

He is an enemy of [[Grawp]], and has tried to ban him [[at least 100]] times.
