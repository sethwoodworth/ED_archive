This [[fat]] attention seeking land whale '''Aoyagi-Seimei''', a.k.a '''Lily''', a.k.a '''Narcissa''' is a delusional [[cosplay|cosplayer]] from [[United States of Australia|Australia]] who is not afraid to [[cry_moar|take action]] against [[4Chan|'cyber bullies']]. Like most cosplayers, she is poor and unemployed, yet still manages to go to [[GIRUGAMESH|anime conventions]] every month and make horrendous dresses that do nothing for her rolls or lack of a neck. She has an 8 year-old son named [[The Great Dumbledore Dies Meme of 2005|Severus]] and when she isn't neglecting him for cosplay, she is dressing him up in shoddily-made costumes and embarrassing the fuck out of him.
She also loves [[beastiality|horses]] and believes that [[furry|she is one]], as she tends to 'flick her ears back' when annoyed and make mare/pony metaphors when speaking about herself. Basically, Lily has the mind of a 14 year-old, while she herself is in her late 20's with a child.

==Whereabouts==

BREAKING NEWS UPDATE! Lily's MOVING! To Sydney, motherfuckers! Awesome for Perth... but hoo boy I hope Sydney is ready for her.
After spending a week in her [[Ausfalia|lovely new town]] for [[Circle_jerk|Animania]] she managed to create so many [[Haters|friends]] that she has made her new provider/girlfriend [[Aids|sick with anxiety]] just dealing with the fallout.


==On The Cosplay Scene==

Stories, rumors and screencaps of Lily were passed around by Aussies all over the /cgl/ board on [[4Chan]]. It seems as though she is very notorious among the cosplayers in the [[vagoo|land down under]] and bringing up her name induces [[face palm|faceplams]] everywhere. From her delusions of rape and false cries of sexual harassment to her God-awful parenting skills, there is never a dull moment when talking about Lily.

Reportedly, Lily got [[banned]] from an anime club in Perth for several different reasons. Aside from annoying the shit out of everyone, she managed to seriously injure a guy by jumping on him with her massive amount of weight and supposedly threatened a person with serious bodily harm and/or death.
Not long after, she began making friends with the cosplayers in Perth. She was new to the scene at the time and nobody knew of the crazy bullshit that flies wherever she goes. 

After nearly killing a well-known cosplayer on an un-worked horse, Lily turned to being an online [[internet stalking|stalker]] and that is when her [[crapflood|shitstorm]] began. At every available chance, the fat bitch began to spread rumors and lies about anyone she could. She began to take credit for making other peoples costumes and claiming some were even purchased, which is apparently a [[the Internet is serious business|big fucking deal]].
Eventually, after many threats and dramatic falling-outs, this [[whore|'grumpy old mare']] was avoided by many Australian cosplayers and is even the butt of jokes at conventions.


{{quote|Lilly is a crazy bitch with a MASSIVE victim complex, and will stop at nothing to besmirch the name of good, decent cosplayers. Someone didn't talk to her at a convention? BAM! Automatic trolling for being 'hurtful', 'spiteful' and 'evil'. She is chock-full of contradictions, claiming that she is polite and sweet to people she even dislikes, though it is painfully obvious that she likes nothing more than stabbing people in the back. Her coterie is made up of innocent weeaboos who don't know just how nasty she can be.|Anonymous Acquaintance}}

EDIT: COSPRAY DRAMA, SRS BUSINESS, I DRESS UP AND HAVE NO LIFE OUTSIDE THESE FRABRICS, (OR LACKOF) SADFACE.

==Landwhale==

Despite her [[over 9000]] fat rolls, Lily is convinced she is sexxxxy. However, she seems to have been made aware of the fact that people call her the landwhale. In the most stupid dA journal ever, she had the following to say regarding the issue:

{{quote|With time, we gain weight because we accumulate so much information and wisdom in our heads that when there is no more room, it distributes out to the rest of our bodies. So we aren’t heavy, we are enormously cultured, educated and happy.

Beginning today, when I look at my butt in the mirror I will think, “Good grief, look how smart I am!”|Lily}}

That's right. She isn't fat because she thinks that pasta is an excellent way to diet, she's fat because she's overflowing with [[retarded|smartness]]. 

==Animal Abuse==

Not too long ago, Lily used to be a proud owner of some show horses (which probably explains all the pony and mare metaphors). Unfortunately, her right to own them was taken away by the RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals). She had apparently neglected the creatures until they were starved, eating weeds in dust-filled paddocks and had split hooves and ribs sticking out, as well as all sorts of diseases and digestion problems. She claimed she 'rescued and rehabilitated' abused horses, but in reality she was the one abusing them.

==Child Abuse==


Horses and Jew Cake aren't the only thing Lily abuses.

When browsing through her deviantArt page, it does not take long to discover that this [[man the harpoons|land whale]] has somehow managed to [[secks|reproduce]]. The child's name is Severus (as if ''that'' isn't abuse enough, [[amirite?]]) after the character '''Severus Snape'''. Yes, from ''Harry Potter''.

Lily loves to dress up little Severus in embarrassing costumes to match her. Some of his favorites include [[Pikaman|Pikachu]], Sealand from [[Hetalia]] and Howl. While making her Madam Red costume, Lily attempted to dress Severus up as [[gay|Ciel Phantomhive]] . . . in his trap dress. Of course, after her parents bitched her out about turning her child into a faggot, she was forced to drop this plan.

Up until July 2010, the little boy had his own account on dA and would post endearing blogs about his mummy. The entries were obviously written by Lily, because even an 8 year-old has better grammar than her. Sadly, the page did not last long, due to the fact that the creator of this page reported it, for fear that the poor child was being exploited. 

While away from home, it is not uncommon for "Severus" to be left without warning as the responsibility of those she calls friends. Reasons for the dumping are usually hilarious and to be expected from someone who is mentally still a child herself.

==Chase the Failure==

Because Chase the Morning is primarily fatties who stuff themselves full of Krispy Kreme whenever they go over east to WIN ALL THE POINTS in competitions (and then complain to the judges when better people win), they have been nicknamed Chase The Doughnut. Lily seems to have found this out. She has borrowed the dA of the pawn that she leeches off when it comes to day-to-day expenses (and heck everything else is paid for by this poor girl), and created a Chase-The-Doughnut dA club or group or whatever the fuck they're called. However, looking at the content you see that it manages to not only be not funny, but creepy as fuck. Need an example? Watch the youtube video they link. That's right, she filmed and uploaded the microwaving of a [[furry|teddy bear]]. I am really curious as to what that little note in front of the microwave says.

Lily's former friend, Amy/Princessd9 has given up on having to defend Lily and has gone back to the normal Perth scene, however some are distrusting and believe her to be a spy. <strike>Amy herself is a lovely woman who's trying to get her life back on track, and good luck to her. </strike> LOL NO she's a two-faced bitch who will talk about you behind your back. I'll just point out that she hasn't apologized, or even acknowledged, all the poison and filth that she spat when she was under Lily's command. 

Formerly Lily's friend and [[white knight]] (and proud of it), Amy/Princessd9 has reportedly given up on having to defend Lily and has come grovelling back to the Perth scene, however no-one is really trusting her and believes her to be a spy. Amy herself is a horrible woman who holds FOREVERZ grudges over being turned down by a cosplayer who was essentially in a relationship already, and being let down gently by her girlfriend, and thinks anyone who doesn't understand how OMG HORRIBLE those people were are TRAITORS FOREVERZ. A temporary member of Chase the Doughnut was completely attacked by her when he decided to spend a day in the city with a highly successful cosplayer (therefore an OMG ENEMY) and an ex-friend who refused to think that Amy is justified in her stupid grudges. 

Amy's favorite thing is to post numerous DA journals, write angsty South Park fanfic that represents her PAIN over the SAD SITUATIONS WHERE HER FRIENDS BETRAY HER )': and draw South Park yaoi. Some of her cosplay isn't too bad- her TWEWY costume would have looked great if it was on a skinny person (and why is it that she always picks people that reveal a lot of skin and stuff anyway? The character she picked, Shiki, is basically anorexic and has a pelvis bone that looks like it'd take an eye out.). Her face isn't too bad, it's just that it's attached to... a whole lot of her. And then she's decided that she is a completely underrated cosplayer because she has been cosplaying for sooo looong and she doesn't understand why she hasn't won a competition with her awesome cosplays! Well, maybe because your CC was frumpy, badly made and unflattering, and your Mai Valentine looked like you were wrapped in a big purple garbage bag. Lily might be hated, but at least she can sew.

Also note that she is so proud of her Jewish heritage that she got a Jew-tattoo. Wait... aren't Jewish people against tattoos? doesn't that mean you can't get buried in their graveyard? OH NO. New research has shown that Amy is not actually a Jew. She's just so desperate to be edgy and cool that she got a jewish tattoo. Because she likes south park thaaaat much, apparently. Anyone else thinking getting another religion's religious symbol tattooed onto your body is disrespectful?

Lily's NEW source of money is a bitchy psychopath with a victim complex who happily gives all her money to Lily (so she can buy 100M of fabric to turn into petticoats), simply because then Lily keeps up the pretense of a long distance relationship. It's not Kellie anymore, now it is Nicole.

==Lily's Ten Commandments of Life==

{{quote|"And then the Almighty Land-Whale in the Sky, bequeathed these stone tables to It's only disciple, clothed in a bolt of the finest Party Satin and cheap ribbon. 
"Narcissa Lilly/Sheryl Nome/Madam Red/Unicorn/insert more names here, I bequeath these rules of life to you. Follow them to the letter and you will always have a waist size of 80CM" 
It boomed in a voice unlike Hatsune Miku.
And Lily took the two Stone Tablets underneath her Satin encrusted arms and, Australia was doomed. |Anonymous Source}}
