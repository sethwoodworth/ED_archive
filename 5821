On Wednesday, October 11th, 2007, some [[anonymous]] [[white|honkey]] decided hang a noose on the door of Aunt Jemima's office at Columbia University.

This single event managed to set [[black|civil rights progress]] back by approximately 2 centuries. 

Everything done by every righteous member of the movement... from Martin Luther King, to the black chick on the bus, and even that dude that wears an X on his black baseball cap... All of their accomplishments went down the drain on this fateful day.

[[Fucktard|Baffled]] and [[Emo|anguished]] students and [[dying alone|professors]] wondered [[IDIFTL|how this could happen at Teachers College]], which cherishes its image as a bastion of liberalism and multiculturalism.

Madonna G. Constantine, the professor that was targeted by this not-exactly-vicious-nor-notable hate crime, made a few dull comments to a gaggle of slackers that didn't have anything better to do. A handful of college kids walked around the block a few times [[cult|chanting]] “no diversity, no university”. Afterwards, most of them headed down to Starbucks to order a double mocha mocha french espresso and chat about global warming.

Regarding the noose incident, the police said that their hate crimes unit(also known as the 'too much of a faggot to be a real cop' unit) had mounted a full investigation, including testing the rope for DNA. They ruled out the possibility that Constantine could have placed the noose on the door [[attention whore|herself]].

On Thursday, police investigators claimed to have reviewed several surveillance tapes, and might be able to determine the identity of the prankster with additional footage from other cameras. Columbia University said "Uh uh, girlfriend, yousa gonna need a warrant for that shiznit.", proving that the University doesn't really give a damn about justice and truth, and care far more about [[attention whore|something else]].
