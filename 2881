'''Fat Larry's Band''' are the musical equivalent of [[God]]s. Their trademark mix of angelic melodies and biting social satire has produced such hits as ZOOM and... er...???? 

The rhyme of ''Zoom'' and ''Boom'' with ''Moon'' has captivated scholars of music for [[at least 100]] years. If Shakespeare were alive today, he would go to school and earn three degrees in his pursuit of the genius that is locked within the lyrics penned by Fat Larry's Band.

The world was saddened on the 24th of August 2006 with the news that Fat Larry had died some twenty years earlier, cutting short an otherwise promising young career.

===Zoom Lyrics===
{{blueblink|Zoom just one look and then my heart went boom,<br>suddenly and we were on the moon,<br>flyin' high in a neon sky ohh ohh}}
<br>
{{blueblink|Bang Just one touch and all the church bells rang,<br>heaven called and all the angels sang,<br>sunrise shine in the midnight sky ohh ohh}}
