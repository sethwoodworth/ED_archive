'''Pamela Geller''' Jew (aka '''Atlasshrugs2000''') is the [[IRL troll]] who invented the [[meme]] known as the [[Ground Zero Mosque]] and owner of [http://atlasshrugs.com atlusshrugs.com]. Need we say more? Well, simply labeling her as a [[Randroid]] wouldn't give you the complete picture. For example, you may inadvertently believe that she's an [[Atheist]] like her beloved idol [[Ayn Rand]] Jew, but Geller is in fact [[Jewish]] ([[srsly]]). Geller also has the habit of [http://www.google.com/images?q=Pamela+Geller posing in every picture taking of her]. 

Unsurprisingly for Jew, Geller has a deep-seated hatred for [[Islam]]. She co-founded [http://sioaonline.com/ Stop Islamization of America], and she believes that [[Obama]] is the [[antichrist]] (or at least the Jewish version of that concept). Geller is also bests of pals with [http://www.jihadwatch.org/ Robert Spencer], who aids her in [[Rick Sanchez|dominating American media]] with their books, blogs, and news columns.

==<s>Crusade</s> Jihad against Campbell's Soup==
[[File:Boycott Campbell Soup.JPG|thumb|[[:File:CommunismMp3.png|When you buy soup, you're funding terrorism]].]]

Sometime in mid-October 2010, Geller called for a boycott of Campbell's because the [[Muslims|Islamic Society of North America]] said that their soup was safe to eat. Geller contends that the Islamic Society of North America is aiding terrorists and allowing them to certify food is somehow allowing terrorists to win in their war on the United States. [[Citation needed|In reality]], Islamic Society of North America simply supports sending food going through the [[Freedom Flotilla|Israeli blockade]] in order to save starving children, but everyone knows that if you feed Hamas' children, you're giving the terrorists the winning edge needed to overpower the mighty Israeli military and air force. Of course, Geller loves pretending that she isn't a [[Zionist]].

==Crusade Against Park 51==
Geller was also the blogging spark that ignited the flaming pile of [[butthurt]] that became the outrage surrounding the proposed ''[[Park 51]]'' development that became known to the world as the <font color=red><big>'''ISLAMIC JIHAD 9/11 VICTORY MONUMENT AT GROUND ZERO!!!eleven1'''</big></font>
