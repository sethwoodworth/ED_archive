[[Image:IS_IT_CAN_BE_HUGS_TIEM_NOW_PLEES_CAT.jpg|right|thumb|How dare they.]]
[[Image:Cat23.jpg|right|thumb|Artistic impression of the microwave post-cat.]]The '''Camrose Cat Killers''' are four [[awesome|piece of shit]] [[Lolcow|brats]] in Camrose, Alberta, [[Canadia]] who microwaved their neighbors [[shit nobody cares about|poor, non-asthma inducing, innocent, cute, and all around adorable]] [[cat|kitty cat]] named [[Fag|Princess]] - like they were reenacting that [[Funny|stupid]] urban legend with the poodle.  

Then they wrote "[[Lulz|Nice cat, look in the microwave!]]" all over the walls. [[Genius|Dickweeds]].

The Canadan government, in their [[retarded|brilliant]] wisdom, says that [[fact|publishing the names of juveniles arrested for crimes is a crime]].  [[Rage|Fuck that: Out the little bastards]].  Eat a [[cock|dick]], [[canadia|Canadan]] government.

==Vengeance==
[[Internets]] tube junctions, like [[Facebook]] and [[Nexopia]], immediately rose up and formed the hate forums.  Even [[Bill Cosby]] hated them and refused to send [[cock|pudding pops]].  The Canadian version of [[The Man]] showed up in the small town, going from house to house warning people not to name names.  When he found the Facebook posts, he went to the posters' homes and threatened little children with jail time unless they used their accounts to delete the names from Facebook.  Then, with the information on the names nowhere to be found, internutters went even more nutters, even offering rewards for the names[http://groups.google.com/group/edm.general/browse_frm/thread/6c8368fba8b8eeec/c09c3821d2640ba4?lnk=st&q=camrose+cat+killers+names#c09c3821d2640ba4].
