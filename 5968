'''Old School''' is a term that [[hipster]]s use to describe things they think are badass because they are [[old|'classic']].

This term can be applied to a wide range of things however you will most likely hear this phrase when  [[fanboi]]s discuss:

*Old musical equipment such as inferior [[vinyl|analog sound]] and tube amps.
*[[ARS|Old Guard]]: the pre-[[Chanology]] Scientology enturbulators.
*[[Skateboard-City|Skateboarding]] techniques
*[[indie|Vintage clothing]]
*The [[binary|early days]] of computing and the [[Internets]].

Niggers and [[wiggers]] also use the term '''old school''' (and/or '''OG'''* -from "original gangster") with regards to [[rap]] music and culture. 

The Japanese also have a [[fetish]] for '''old school''' American sneakers and Levis jeans.

Also, the term "old school" is something that is often used by 13-year-olds over online games who wait until the actual pioneers are dead and then label themselves as so.  The nerdnoobfucks who believe this false entitlement are clearly epic douchebags, for a 6-year-old's comprehension of a mass-multiplayer video game would be a solid sentiment of pure shit.
