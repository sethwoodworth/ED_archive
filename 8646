[[File:Uboa.jpg|thumb|250px|The original]]
Uboa is an NPC from the 2005 [[hipster|indie]] exploration game ''Yume Nikki''. The character is an alternate form of the NPC fans have named Poniko. He replaces Poniko soon as you turn off the light, and plays a continuous muted "aaaaaaah" sound, (if properly filtered,) surprising most people. If you turn off the light in Poniko's house, there is a 1 in 64 chance that you will see Uboa. It was originally thought you had to kill Poniko first and return for another chance, but this has easily and quickly been proven false. Once Uboa appears the screen shakes slightly, the room darkens and a fairly quiet buzz ([[fags|fans]] write the onomatopoeia as 'AAAAAAAAAAAああああああああああああ' [a reference to an event triggered in another part of the game]). Touching Uboa brings you to a land covered in a [[Cum|thick white goop]] where [[Fat|giant]] [[Women|monsters]] [[Period|spill blood]] all over the place. Some [[Babies|people]] are scared [[Shit_Bricks|shitless]] by Uboa. Those people are [[13-year-old_boy|pathetic]].
== Finding Uboa ==
Fall asleep, go through the Nexus (the room with all the doors) and enter Snow World. [[Poor|Walk]]/[[Bike|bike]] northwest until you find a lone [[Club_Penguin|igloo]]. Enter and once inside interact with the pool of water. You will be teleported to an [[Tampon|island in a pink sea]]. Follow the path until you see a pink balloon and interact with it. You'll be sent to the center of the pink sea. Wander north until you find a green one. touch the balloon, enter the house.
# Turn the switch off.

== Other Notes ==
# Uboa also has a [[Chan|*chan]] board dedicated to it and Yume Nikki. You should [http://www.uboachan.net check it out], watch out for spoilers though. They're creating a fan-made sequel to Yume Nikki that most likely wont be finished for at least [[over 9000|9000]] years.
# The game appears on [http://vsrecommendedgames.wikia.com/wiki/PC /v/'s recommended games wiki].
# Yume Nikki is free to play and download, link below.
