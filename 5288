'''Mehungwaylo''' (AKA. '''Cameron Hamilton''' from [[California|'''Tracy, CA''']]) is the latest [[unfunny]] clone of [[Maddox]] to discover the internets.  Writing on his [http://www.mehungwaylo.com website] about such enlightening topics as [[fag|his penis]], [[rules 1 and 2|trolling in real life]], and [[dying alone|how much holidays suck]], you are sure to be [[lie|treated to a goldmine of humor and wit every time you visit his page.]]

Mehungwaylo has [[Asperger's Syndrome]] and relies on his [[hugbox]] for his [[Internet Tough Guy|internet toughness]], as evidenced by the following quote:

{{quote|Why Am I So Great? When I was a little kid [[unwarranted self importance|my mom worshipped everything I do.]] Short story, I grew up to be an asshole who worships everything he does.|Mehungwaylo, describing an upbringing similar to that of [[Chris-chan]]}}

Mehungwaylo freely gives away his personal information on his website.  While he presumably does this to give further credibility to his ITG persona, what this really means is that he is [[asking for it]].

==Mehungwaylo.com==

Mehungwaylo's website is your standard Wordpress [[blog]] maintained by an [[angst]]y, social outcast [[Gaiafag]].  Having just discovered the internet, it is likely that Mehungwaylo believes that [[Maddox|writing about how great you are and how much everyone else sucks]], [[fag|especially women]], is an easy way to become successful [[OTI]].  His writings are the [[shit|standard fare]] for this sort of demographic, and some example topics are:

*[http://mehungwaylo.com/2010/05/22/how-to-improve-pussy-sports/ How to Improve Pussy Sports]
*[http://mehungwaylo.com/2010/05/13/how-to-troll-in-real-life/ How to Troll in Real Life]
*[http://mehungwaylo.com/2010/05/13/holidays-blow/ Holidays Blow]
*[http://mehungwaylo.com/2010/05/13/today-i-kicked-an-old-mans-ass/ Today I Kicked an Old Man's Ass]
*[http://mehungwaylo.com/2010/05/13/i-hate-cops/ I Hate Cops]

This brief selection of articles gives one a very interesting insight into the [[cunt|man]] that is Tyler Deardon.  One can see a very distinct pattern of Mehungwaylo overcompensating for his own sexuality.  

{{quote|How many girls have I slept with? [[0|I never answer this question.]]|Mehungwaylo}}
{{quote|Why are you so mean to girls? I got tested for [[AIDS|sexism]]. I came up positive.|Mehungwaylo}}

His disdain for police is similar to [[Chris-chan|another famous Aspie's]], and his dislike of holidays likely stems from the fact that he spends most of them [[alone]].  This, in itself, is not [[lulz]]-worthy, as blogs like Mehungwaylo's are a dime a dozen on the internets, but his e-toughness level is well above and beyond any ever reported.

===Hacked===

On May 3rd, 2010, his website was hacked by a [[script kiddie]] who presumably redirected it to [[Goatse]] or some other [[shock site|appropriate location]].  Mehungwaylo was naturally [[rage|enraged]] at this situation, and [http://www.thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=168797&sid=bec5cd0f2c141e323cf62a064c93465a voiced his displeasure here].  This post makes it quite evident that Mehungwaylo clings to his [[blog]] as the sole pillar of meaning in his life:

{{quote|Listen Bastard child talk shit about whatever you want but this is a [[SERIOUS BUSINESS|serious fucking matter]]. My website is one of one things I [[shit nobody cares about|care]] about. In fact, if I was given the altametum between taking my website down and you getting shoot in the head. [[lolwut|You better wish your bullet proof]].}} 

==Cameron Hamilton: [[Internet Tough Guy]]==

In order to further support his claim of being an [[ITG|internet tough guy]], Cameron adopted the moniker "Tyler Deardon", a [[No|sly]] reference to the main character of [[Fight Club]]. Only the toughest on the internet are [[Stupid|brave]] enough to self-[[dox]] themselves. Until of course you realize that Tyler's entire dox-dropping was a hoax.  "Tyler Deardon" is actually '''[[Powerword|Cameron Hamilton]]'''. [[PROTIP]]: If you're going to come up with a fake internet personality for yourself, your e-persona probably shouldn't live in the same town as you if you want to avoid being uncovered.  You probably shouldn't also [http://buzz.yahoo.com/article/1:c84dec2aa1e1925d7fb9e6f6cd069f00:4731bcb541ee9c057669559e7b54a748/Urine-Spit-Mustard-Pickles--Anything-Else-On-That-Hamburger use things associated with your real name] to promote the writings of your e-persona.  What Mehungwaylo is obviously too [[13-year-old boy|young]] and/or [[newfag|internets-inexperienced]] to realize is that there is a [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE|very specific reason]] not to publish or leave the door open to access this kind of information on the internet.  After all, what employer would want to hire someone who [[gay|gives away coupons for free blowjobs]] or [[lie|brags about his large penis]] on the internet.  Cameron is clearly not at the age where this would be an issue for him, or he would realize this.

Fortunately, when he does eventually reach that age and [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|DELETES FUCKING EVERYTHING]], this page will be the top [[Google]] result for "Cameron Hamilton."

==Mehungwaylo vs. Trolls==

Mehungwaylo has a "[[Troll]]s" section on his website, though the reason for its existence is unknown as, up to this point, his site has barely received any attention.  He states that anyone who wishes to troll him must post a picture of himself/herself along with a link to his/her [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]], or any other profile page that could be traced back to said troll's [[RL|real life]].  Obviously, nobody would be stupid enough to take the [[bait]] when [[ED|much easier methods exist]].

Along with his request for dox prior to any trolling, Cameron also posts this [[dubious disclaimer]]:

{{quote|Disclaimer: By leaving a comment with a link to your website your (sic) giving me the rights to use any image of you found on that page. You will be held liable for damages caused by linking to a page not owned or controlled by you. You give me all rights to use the image found on the page as I want. If you don’t agree then don’t comment on my website.|Mehungwaylo, citing [[internet law]] and affirming that trolling him is [[SERIOUS BUSINESS]]}}

==Mehungwaylo and Maddox==

Mehungwaylo is a huge fan of Maddox, [[Tucker Max]], and other such sites that were relevant ten years ago, providing some insight into his [[plagiarism|creative muses]].  He maintains an [http://www.thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=17749 account] on the forums for The Best Fanpage in the Universe, a Maddox fansite, and appears to be reviled by the majority of that site's posters.  In [http://www.thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=17038 this thread], he is called out for his blatant ripping off of Maddox, and responds in kind:

{{quote|What you referenced was based off my sexism. [[homosexual|I dont like women, really I fucking hate there shit.]] The idiot test was based off that stupid fucking I.Q. test pop up that says 99.9% of Americans get this questio wrong.|Mehungwaylo, explaining everything.}} 

Mehungwaylo [http://www.thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=170166&highlight=#170166 attempted to troll] another member of the Maddox fan forums by [[Gay|pretending to be a girl]].  Cameron claims that this was a clever ruse to get the target to come out of the closet.  However, his true intentions of finding a life partner were quite [[obvious]].

==Defeated==

Cameron, upon discovering this article, has in fact decided to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]].  Of course, thanks to Google Cache, his hijinks will never be completely forgotten.  [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&q=site%3Amehungwaylo.com&btnG=Search&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai= Here] is a link to pretty much every page on his site.
