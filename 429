'''Joshua Nimm''', or as he will forever be remembered, '''An Halo''', was an [[13-year-old boy|11-year-old boy]] who became yet another [[video game]]-related casualty. He became [[an hero]] on [[last Thursday|4th September]], 2008. His death is sure to spark [[drama]] amongst [[concerned mother]]s everywhere, now claiming that [[Bullshit|playing video games can lead kids to become suicidal]]. Nimm's death was part of a [[cosplay|''Halo'' re-enactment]]. He was trying to recreate a suicide from the game, [[doing it wrong|becoming an hero himself in the process.]]
Unfortunately because it was a [[lulz|suicide]] he had to wait even longer than usual to respawn. :(

While [[some argue]] it was a hoax or [[prank]], [[truth|the death has been confirmed]].

The story was that Nimm was so [[hardcore]] into ''[[Halo]]'' that he decided to skip school for a day of gaming. Deciding he wanted [[moar]] than just [[the game]], he tried to re-enact parts of it [[IRL]]. Instead of going for the [[school shooting|high score]] as Master Chief does with aliens, Nimm tried to recreate a [[suicide]] from the game (can Master Chief even commit suicide via headshot?). He took the magazine out of the gun, but [[fail|forgot to remove the round from the chamber.]] Seconds later, he was immortalized as [[an hero|An Halo]] to us all. [[Where is your x now?|WHERE IS YOUR CARDBOARD OVERSHIELD NOW]]!? Just make sure your GLASSES don't fall down when you put your supreme protection on. What a fuckin' [[noob]] that's minus one kill on your score, idiot.

=== The In-Game Suicide ===
The mention of a suicide within <i>Halo 3</i> often confuses people, as most players play through the entire campaign without noticing it.  The suicide itself is an easter egg.  In the level Floodgate, one will eventually find a lone marine sitting in the corner of a room among several corpses, talking to himself as he is traumatized by the loss of his fellow soldiers to the flood infection.

{{squote|I... I didn't have a choice... The L.T... the Sergeant... they were all infected! I could see it crawling... sliming around beneath their skin!! A-and then they got up... they s-started to talk! Oh, God! Their voices!! Oh, God! No, make them stop! I did them a favor... y-yeah that's it; I helped them! Maybe... maybe I need to do myself... a fav...|The suicidal marine as he points his magnum to his head.}}

*It is also somewhat important that the marine in-game never does commit suicide, and only dies if the player chooses to kill him.  So, technically, in pulling the trigger, Joshua was not reenacting this scene. <s>well actually if u leave the room and come back the marine is dead with one bullet missing from his clip[[FAIL]]</s> The marine never does commit suicide on-screen. But the point still remains that the marine does commit suicide if you leave the room.

== [[BAWWW|Reactions]] ==

[[Anonymous]] and (hopefully) most readers of this article will [[LOL]] at this [[lulz|tragic]] [[death]]. However, [[old people]] and [[concerned mother]]s see things differently.

{{quote|It's stunning. The thought of losing my child accidentally or [[an hero|otherwise]]. I can't imagine.|A [[concerned mother]], on [[Truth|Nimm's death]].}}

{{quote|I am still in shock. I mean, Master Chief never, at any point pointed a gun to his head. Did I miss something here?|[[Anon]].}}
