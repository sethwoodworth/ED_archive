'''Jeff "Sunbiz" Kalom''' is perhaps the [[internet]]'s most prolific [[troll]], boasting a repertoire of [[over 9000]] separate trolling accounts for which he used to [[rape]] the [[message board]] for the [[Chicago Cubs|Shitcago Cunts]] for over 6 years. In addition to his online douchebaggery, Jeff also [[IRL]] trolled multiple women from the forum before rightfully having the [[banhammer]] dropped on his pedo-stachioed mug.

==The History of Jeff==
Jeff Kalom grew up a troubled child. As a result, his parents had him attend a [[church]] camp located in the Dominican Republic known as "Escuela Caribe" (Carribean School). This "[[school]]" was a sect of the radical Christian youth group called "New Horizons Youth Ministries", founded in 1971. It is believed that Jeff and his fellow pupils - one of which was author Julia Scheers - experienced [[molest|sexual violation]], excruciating overwork and [[yiri|abuse]] during their time there. The abuse that took place was documented in detail in Scheers's [[book|novel]], "Jesus Land: A Memoir".

After several months at Caribe, Jeff eventually departed to move back in with his [[parents]]. It is here he would live for the next three years. Under the pressure of his parents, Jeff began seeking employment opportunities. After months of failed attempts, Jeff landed a job at none other than New Horizons Youth Ministries. His first assignment - counselor at his "Alma Mater", Escuela Caribe.

Jeff did not sustain a long tenure with New Horizons but in the brief time he over-sought the Domincan church camp, he allegedly took part in abusive and humiliating misconduct with children there himself. Perhaps the most infamous of which was the forcing of a number of children to use buckets as toilets, in what he claims was simply a more environmentally-friendly process of "recycling their wastes".

Jeff was terminated after just a year of employment. The official reasoning for his firing was "cigarette use on campus", however it is likely that he was dismissed for engaging in abuse that even New Horizons found unacceptable.

In 2004, Jeff Kalom moved to Naples, Florida, where he got a new job opportunity with The Florida Department of State Division of Corporations (aka "Sunbiz"). This is also when Jeff would begin frequenting the Chicago Cubs Message Board.

After visiting for quite some time and developing close relationships with many of the board's members, Jeff began receiving mysterious emails from an apparent stalker. These letters documented the abuse that he allegedly committed while a counselor at Caribe. Jeff feared that someone with this information could result in him losing this secure, well-paying job of his that he had sough for so long, so he set out to find and silence whomever it was that was harassing him.

There were no leads to start with, so Jeff delved into the art of computer hacking and attempted to utilize it to trace the emails that were sent to him. He was unsuccessful. Frustrated and suffering from delusional disorder brought on by his paranoia, Jeff considered that his stalker could be a member of the Cubs Message Board. His primary suspect (whose name will be withheld) was also a resident of Florida, which is likely why he suspected this person the most. Jeff was able to manipulate this person - whom had developed a trusting relationship with Jeff after years of conversing on the forum - into revealing their personal information to him, which he then used to carry out a series of his own harassments (most of which were by telephone). Jeff would make phone calls to this person at ungodly hours of the morning and leave dozens of threatening voicemails, some of which are still archived online.

Jeff's crusade against this person ceased when [[internet lawsuit|charges]] were formally pressed against him by his victim, which were later dropped.

He has since moved back with his now [[sick|ailing]] parents to attend to them.

==Jeff's Harassing Voicemails==

A few of the infamous harassing voice mails Mr. Kalom left were recorded and have been archived on the internet. You can listen to them [http://sunbiz1.tripod.com/id20.html here].
