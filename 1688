Comedy Central
[[Image:Cartman-Hitler.jpg|right|300px|The [[Hitler|president]] of Comedy Central.]]
'''Comedy Central''' is, as opposed to what its name suggests, the most [[unfunny]] television network ever. It consists of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', nine-hour marathons of [[Unfunny|''Mad TV'']], [[moar]] parody news programs than you can shake a dick at, and on the weekends, more <s>B</s>F-list movies than you could ever imagine. The only reason anybody watches the channel is to catch the new episode of ''[[South Park]]'', only to be found that late at night. Bad comedy movies and failed shows such as ''Too Late with Adam Carolla'' clog the airwaves with pestilence, boredom, and death. The only other show which made Comedy Central less unbearable to watch were reruns of ''[[Bullshit|Family Guy]]'', but the station heads, in a true display of their infinite wisdom, decided to stop airing it.

== Current Comedy Central Line-Up ==
[[Image:Mencia.jpg|thumb|DEE DEE DEE! DEE DEE DEE! BEANER! DEE DEE DEE! WETBACKS! DEE DEE DEE!]]
*7:00 AM: [[Unfunny|Hours and hours of ''Mad TV'' reruns.]]
*9:00 AM: [[Torture|3 solid hours of very bad amateur standup comedians.]]
*12:00 PM [[Shit nobody cares about|That movie you thought about seeing, but then you realize it's not going to be good on cable because of the edits.]]
*4:00 PM: ''[[Zach Braff|Scrubs]]'' (The same four episodes played everyday, all day.)
*5:00 PM: ''[[The Daily Show]]'' ([[Leftard]] jokes and a boring interview.)
*6:00 PM: ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' (Half-hour of the most lulzworthy, blatant satire on TV)
*7:00 PM: [[Zach Braff|Scrubs]] (A half-hour of forced memes and [[gay|butt secks]])
*9:00 PM: ''[[Futurama]]'' (Either one of the Bender episodes or the alien episodes)
*9:30 PM: ''[[South Park]]'' (Either one of the fart-joke ridden episodes or the preachy episodes.  Wait a minute, isn't that all South Park is?)
*10:00 PM: ''[[tosh.0]]''/Reno 911!/New episodes of ''[[South Park]]''  (an unfunny look at Internets/Police/Childhood).
*2:00 AM: [[Scam|Nothing but 5 solid hours of ''Girls Gone Wild'' commercials]]. (''The Colbert Report'' likes to claim they have cooking product ads on, but it's always ''Girls Gone Wild''. No other network airs these, either.)

== The Secret Stash ==
[[Image:Drawn-Together-orgy.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Comedy Central's Secret Stash can't show live-action nudity, but it CAN show you cartoon nudity.]] 
The Comedy Central Secret Stash is basically Comedy Central playing stolen HBO specials, such as ''Eddie Murphy Raw'', which is extremely dated and hardly funny, and the uncut version of ''[[Shit no one cares about|Not Another Teen Movie]]'' aired very late at night. They only thing different is they can say words like "[[fuck]]" after 1 AM Sunday morning.  

Once in a while you get to see a series of Dave Chappelle reruns of his standup, and his former wildly successful ''[[Dave Chappelle|Chappelle's Show]]'' (which is ironic, since Viacom and their boys ran Chappelle out of the country and into Africa, for reasons only the Kennedy Assassination could answer). But for the most part, most Secret Stash shows are Chappelle reruns, below-average comedians who should have never gotten ''any'' HBO special, National Lampoon movies, ''Drawn Together'' mini-marathons and ''Girls Gone Wild'' ads.

Believe it or not, ''[[The Drawn Together Show|Drawn Together]]'' has a [[Gloom]] map made for it.
