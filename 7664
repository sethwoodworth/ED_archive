'''[http://www.somethingawful.com Something Awful]''', an [[unfunny]] [[lie|comedy]] website owned by [[Lowtax]], and traces its roots back to the good old days of [[Web 1.0]], where [[Goatse]] was the pinnacle of [[shock]] and the [[LJ]] in "LJ [[drama]]" did not yet exist. The whole point of Something Awful is to make jokes only self-hating nerds find funny. SA also attempts to pick on [[furry|internet sub-cultures even more pathetic than they are]]. SA readers feel threatened by clown-like furries and [[juggalos]], as they are all members of these subcultures themselves and fear exposure for the human detritus that they are.

As you all know, many faggot nerds view the internet as very [[serious business]], and, as a result, other, slightly more useful nerds realized that mocking their only slightly-more pathetic ways was a good way to relieve stress caused by the fact that no one likes them at [[school]], the site became very popular very quickly. The community dynamic at Something Awful changed significantly over the years, from a community dedicated to humor to a community filled with [[butthurt]] [[aspies]] with broken [[hugbox|hugboxes]]. Because of this, communities like [[SASS|The Something Awful Sycophant Squad]] had popped up, criticizing Something Awful in a way akin to how the forums operated in the early days.

Something Awful is the only site to date to hate [[furries]] and yet not manage to make said [[h8|hate]] funny. Thus, Something Awful can possibly be said to be even more brimming full of [[fail]] than furries, since even furries are very occasionally able to successfully make fun of themselves.

==The Frontpage==
Dear Richard,

A few years ago, SA went from bad to worse. Lowtax's crazy, attention whore fiance dumped him via SA's front page, detailing his foot fetish and general faggotry in what may be the one funny SA front page update since 2001. This incident was in fact so incredibly lulzy that Lowtax developed a powerful hatred of [[lulz]] itself, and would later ban them entirely from the forums. Lowtax retreated into a cocoon of [[butthurt]], stopped writing on the site and to keep the asspie gravy train going they hired on a bunch of retarded chimps to write frontpage articles and adopted Jlist.com as a sponsor. Because of this, you had at least 30 [[anime]] tits pressing against your screen at any one time that you looked at the site begging you to come buy some disgusting [[tentacle rape]] [[hentai]]. 

To make matters worse, Lowtax also introduced a [[LiveJournal]]-style feature for all the writers called '''Daily Dirt'''.  Lowtax himself would oftentimes use this to express his irritation with the million [[juggalos]] who wrote him with death threats every day and toot his own horn, going on to say that if it was the webmaster of some other wonderful and successful site who was emailing him he might be at least slightly offended. None of the other [[faggot|writers]] give a shit about Daily Dirt. It's filled it with unfunny chatlogs and pictures in their computer's picture folder, when they even remember to update. 

None of the Something Awful writers have yet to acknowledge the irony of making a comedic career out of ridiculing the type of sad [[basement dwelling]] [[otaku]] who [[masturbation|beat one off]] to cartoons and update their LiveJournal obsessively with every thought that pops into their vapid minds, and then turning around and bombarding you with the exact same thing. Possibly because they are now rich from all of the nerds who read the front page clicking the banner ads for J-List.

==The Website's Features==
===Awful Link of the Day===
Used to feature hilariously absurd and disgusting links, but now in the day and age of a billion shrieking [[blog]]s, every Awful Link of the Day is usually an [[old meme]].

''Is my site a potential candidate for the prestigious Awful Link of the Day award?''

Is it
*a web gallery displaying your quality [[WWOEC|pornographic ''Rugrats'' fan art]]?
*a [[Geocities]] site dedicated to ranting about how the [[Bible]] contains hidden messages about our alien overlords?
*A Geocities site dedicated to pictures of your miscarried fetus?
*A blog dedicated to how much you like anime?
*Any type of [[furry]] website?
*An internet [[porn]] site that costs money and has ugly actors?
*The website of a well-known political leader who a Something Awful writer wants to write a half-baked political rant about?

If you answered "yes" to any or all, submit it [http://www.somethingawful.com/alods/index.htm here] right away

===[[Photoshop]] Phriday===
Every Friday, you get to wade through all of the ugly, unfunny photo manipulations the Goons shat out (made even worse by SA's shitty [[watermark]] which often takes up half of the joke itself), to find the one or two funny ones. Or you can just read it for Livestock's quips, which sound like, and are about as funny as, the output of a random Zippy-the-Pinheadism generator. However, [[some argue]] that they are actually kind of funny for something written by Livestock. In fact, most of them are ghost-written by Zach because he's usually too lazy to write them.

The only good thing that can been said about this is that, while not really an accomplishment of any kind, at least it's funnier than [[Fark]].

===Comedy Goldmine===
Where all of the awful photoshops that were even too poorly made to get into Photoshop Phriday go. Also full of anecdotes written by forum members, most of which revolve around the social retardation that emanates from someone who pays money to use a [[message board]].

===The Flash Tub===

[[Image:Dave_Kelly_is_a_bad_man.gif|thumb|Some of Dave Kelly's [[babyfur|lesser known artwork]].]]

The flash equivalent of diarrhea, in which a deformed troll named "[[Shmorky]]" makes surreal flash cartoons about anything that strikes his [[pot]]-addled brain as funny, such as message board posts, [[Imdb|Internet Movie Database]] pages, bits of twine, and misshapen produce. Shmorky's [http://shmorky.com/animation.html terrible cartoons] are obviously trying to hit the "so bad it's funny" margin, but have really only managed the rarely sought-after but oft-achieved "so bad" margin. 

It would seem that he would get the hint of how much he blows when he releases a Playset of animations for the forum Goons to manipulate and make their own flash cartoons with. Their odd cartoons are around ninety-four times funnier than any Trash toon (YOU SEE THAT PUN THERE WOW WHAT SPARKLING WORDPLAY) he has ever concocted himself.

Perhaps the reason his cartoons are the definition of unfunny is because [[Shmorky]] is actually an undercover [[furry]] who made [http://www.livingingreytown.com/ Living in Greytown] and [http://www.lizardcomics.com/ Lizard], a pair of very [[unfunny]] [[comics]], and is hoping to bring Something Awful down from the inside.

===Horrors of Porn===

[[Image:clit.jpg|thumb|left|Something Awful has contributed a lot to Western civilization.]]

This is when they review [http://www.somethingawful.com/d/horrors-of-porn/clown-porn.php really] [http://www.somethingawful.com/d/horrors-of-porn/bug-eater-cockroach.php gross] [http://www.somethingawful.com/d/horrors-of-porn/horrible-saga-swapavi.php porn] and the people who read it pretend they aren't aroused by it, then immediately download it and [[masturbate|jack off]] to it. 

Its claim to fame is exposing the world to [[Chyna]]'s girl-[[penis]] and for creating and then reviewing the most awful porn movie ever: "[[Swap.avi]]".

===Hentai "Reviews"===
The same thing as Horrors of Porn, except it's just  [http://www.somethingawful.com/d/hentai-game-reviews/ a long list of the increasingly disturbing shit that resident sick fuck Zack Parsons jacks off to.] Unlike Horrors of Porn, the reviews sometimes contain actual lulz and original content despite being blatant promotions for SA's, and more recently 4Chan's main source of income, [http://www.jlist.com JList].

===Weekend Web===
Excerpts from message boards that are slightly less lame than the Awful Forums. Used to be funny, but listening to the same old jokes about sexual deviants, furries, video game nerds, [[16 year old girls]], Neo-[[Nazi]]s, conspiracy theorists, and 80-year-old Fundamentalist [[Christian]]s who post pictures of their pet [[cat]]s got kind of played-out. Although goons love proclaiming the aforementioned groups' stupidity, it still stands that they're paying out the nose for the privilege of hanging off a bunch of deluded aspies' nutsacks while JuGgAlO8666 can post on a fully-functioning forum for free. 

Every time a message board is featured on it, it gets [[troll]]ed into oblivion by [[fucktard]]s who think they are clever, whose mantra is "SOMETHING AWFUL DOT COM", which roughly translates to "HOWARD STERN RULES" in [[IRL]] speak.

They once actually did [[4chan]], claiming throughout that it was full of pedos. They then managed to present absolutely no evidence of this. No one knows how.

===Your Band Sucks===

[[Image:scientist.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. David Thorpe, our future overlord.]]

This is a feature where Dr. David Thorpe points out what we all know: a lot of bands suck ass (essentially the modern day white people can't dance joke driven into the ground). Occasionally [[System of a Down|retarded]] [[Tool|fans]] take offense and send emails expressing how much of a [http://www.somethingawful.com/index.php?a=3240 fucking asshole] David Thorpe is. Thorpe responds by posting the stupid e-mails in the column for the [[lulz]], showing them for the crybaby pussies they are.  Unfortunately, David Thorpe sucks as much as the bands he makes fun of, as he is seemingly convinced that casually mentioning Nazis in Internet columns is still offensive. He is also incapable of writing an article without the use of a thesaurus.

===Fashion SWAT===
Chatlogs of Dr. David Thorpe and Zach Parsons making fun of fashion. No one has ever read any of these.

==The Forums==

[[Image:Saforumsfrontpage.gif|thumb|left|Forums main page]]

[[Image:Something awful popular forum threads.png|thumb|The best forum topics are now displayed on every page.]]

[[Image:HiButan4.jpg|frame|What happens when you post.]]

[[Image:Fuckingowned.jpg|thumb|A [[sick fuck]] goon is [[ruined]] by other goons.]]

The '''Something Awful forums''' is the only thing that is still good on the site: if by good, you mean incredibly obnoxious. You have to pay 800 dollars per month for it, $10 more if you want to see the archives, 5 bucks for a custom title, $4.95 for no ads (yes, they actually show ads to their paying customers), 30 dollars for a new emoticon, 10 dollars for a platinum account that offers unique cutting edge features such as searching (which doesn't work) and posting images, and if your wallet has not been [[In the ass|reamed enough]] yet you can donate the rest, so Lowtax could buy a [[Korea]]n wife and a [[incest|purebred]] golden retriever. Because of these requirements, the average Goon is a mixture of high disposable income and low dignity.

The mutated, disgusting sociopaths who are such social pariahs that they have to resort to spending their (parents') money on a message board to satiate their craving for human contact call themselves "'''Goons'''", in reference to their disfigured appearance and/or ethical conduct. Goons can be separated into three categories:

#Assholes
#Neckbeards
#Assholes with neckbeards

Goons are, like the creatures featured in Cronenberg films, a special breed.

The forums, or at least the only parts anyone gives a shit about, are divided into two general categories: [[bullshit|GBS]] and boards [[Lie|so cool]] they can make fun of GBS shit. GBS is teeming with a variety of whitey 2-year college intellectuals and social rejects [[trying too hard]]. The [[Boring|cutting-edge humor]] boards such as [[Unfunny|FYAD]] ridicule anything that can be contrued as funny or cool among the average GBS dweller in an effort to enlarge their e-penii, despite that their site hasn't been relevant in [[At least 100 years ago|a decade]]. These [[Retard|special]] [[Internet tough guy|alpha goons]] often target beloved internet staples such as [[Music|musical elitists]], religious [[atheists]], [[weeaboos]], and [[Manchild|little kids]] who take the web [[Serious Business|too seriously]], all the while denying that they're no better (*All those obnoxious anime sigs in FYAD? Strictly ironic). Like the users on [[4chan|all important internet message boards]], they are [[Unwarranted self importance|modern society's cultural elite]].

Around 50[[Statistics|%]] of the forum are obnoxious [[puberty|prepubescent]] morons who, if you were stuck in a bus with for one minute, would give you cause to forcibly remove your own earlobes and eyeballs with shattered glass to ensure not having to interact with them ever again. These lumps of spoiled meat are the typical "[[nerd]]" type, smelling of Doritos and speaking entirely in ''[[Family Guy]]'' quotes.

Another 40[[Statistics|%]] are the type of cube-dwelling recluse who tend to congeal in any community when you make credit cards and misanthropy the sole arbiters of entry - sociopath [[yuppie]]s, smug rich-kids, scenester scum and other "people" prone to blathering on about [[libertarianism]], [[iPod]]s and their deviant sex lives in lieu of anything approaching culture or taste. With Something Awful ostensibly being a humor forum, these topics are typically discussed in between obligatory [[rape]] and [[Holocaust]] jokes, which have yet to wear out their welcome after six straight years.

The final 10[[Statistics|%]] are people who have gone several years without getting banned by the psychotic fascist moderators and thus think they're in an elite [[faggot]] club because [[The Internet Is Serious Business]]. These people typically die in drama explosions and are not missed.

All of them are self hating nerds: they come to the site to lap up Lowtax's piss from the floor of the internet and hear him tell them how much they fucking suck.

Each section of the forum hates the others and often will have their own ircs for huddling together while talking about how goons from every other section suck more than their own.

Goons and [[furries]] are like Bloods and [[Crips]], if neither Bloods nor Crips got laid (and no, [[yiff]]ing does not count).  See [[salj]].

Comparisons can be made between cults and the Something Awful forums. Lowtax, acting as cult leader, will excommunicate all who dare  to criticize his wisdom and ability to make the [[lulz]] flow. His loyal and faithful followers will vociferously defend Lowtax's honor with flames, mud-slinging, and drama, all to get in good with the big kahuna. Perhaps some of the animosity towards Scientology on the Something Awful forums is not due to hate on principle, but because the Church of [[Scientology]] is in fact Something Awful's main competitor.

Goons identify other goons by asking one another "Do you have stairs in your house?". If you are a goon, the correct answer is "Yes, I am a faggot". This extreme [[faggotry]] comes from an ICQ prank chat log where Lowtax was acting like a robot or something.

===10bux===
Due to Something Awful charging $10 per forum account, when someone says or does something very stupid; or simply mouths off to an admin, someone will usually post "Hope u got 10bux, lol", often with a photographed $10 bill.

===Mods===

[[Image:SA_McCaine.jpg|thumb|right|A photo of SA forum moderator [[pedo|McCaine]], as an example of the sort of people Goons pay money to take [[shit]] from.]]

The mods of the forums are faggots just like mods of any other forums, but the SA mods feel they are entitled to extensive methods of faggotry so that they can steal money from people that pay for memberships.

Should a mod find your opinion distasteful they will reprimand you with their faggotry and should you ever reply to them you will be banned and your money stolen.

===GBS===
A collection of various dregs of humanity. Mostly morbidly obese nerds with neckbeards using the forum to vent and blog about their trifling and menial lives, since noone will read their LiveJournals.

===FYAD===

FYAD is the cool place to hang out  when compared to your parent's basement. You can find most of the [[assburgers|cool people]] there. In FYAD you can just [[wigger|chill]] and do whatever and totally relax. "[[Touhou#TAKE_IT_EASY|Take it easy]]" is the FYAD motto, for example, that's how laid back it is there. Show up if you want to have a [[homosexual | good time]]. Another good reason to show up is if you want to hang out with [[retards | 'tards]]. 

A circlejerk forum for [[chavs]], [[wiggers]], and [[juggalos]]. Be sure to exclaim "FYAD is leaking!" when something [[republican|idiotic]] gets posted in GBS.

===BYOB===

An even shittier, unfunny circle-jerk forum for fags that drove away even its own moderators in disgust.

===HD2K===

<strike>The shittiest, most unfunny circle-jerk forum for fags.</strike> Helldump became so boring [[Baleeted|even Lowtax couldn't stand it anymore]].

==Getting banned from the Something Awful forums==

[[Image:Epg3pedos0.JPG|thumb|right|Being a pedophile is up there next to responding with an emoticon as a serious offense.]]

[[Image:Goon ban.jpg|thumb|right|Although goons universally agree 4chan is only for pedos, that might just be denial.]]

[[Image:Emot-synpa.gif|frame|Posting this in a [[Lowtax]] thread will get you banned.]]

[[Image:lowtaxemo.jpg|thumb|The Something Awful forums are drama-free.]]

If there were too many [[lame]] people on the Awful forums, it would be less fruitful for the writers of the front page to steal material from them, thus, it is second to [[GameFAQs]] in terms of dickweed moderators.

Bannable offenses:
*[[Flame|Flaming]] other users
*[[Troll]]ing other boards
*Posting a one-word or emoticon catchphrase
*Making an introductory post
*Voting 1 on a Lowtax thread. Seriously.
*Saying "Something Awful has a front page?" or otherwise pointing out that Something Awful's front page is sub-par and not the cutting edge of comedy
*[[Bomber116|Murdering your slutty ex-girlfriend]]
*Making a response to someone with the letter "j" in their screenname on the second Wednesday of the month
*Questioning the need for the moderators to be gigantic [[fascist]]s
*Questioning the need for the moderators to be gigantic [[fascist]]s in private messages and on other forums.
*Otherwise disagreeing with the moderators
*Using the letters "e", "f", "w", "d", and "x".
*Saying the word [[Lulz]]. Srsly.
*Disliking [[whore|Alanis Morisette]]. Not even fucking kidding.
*Becoming [[an hero]]. Don't want none of those ghost faggots shitting GBS up from beyond the grave, no sir!

===[[Furry holocaust|The Lolocaust]]===

[[Image:lolstika.gif|thumb|right|The new Reich of lulz]]

Long ago, the posting of "[[furry]]" porn, or depictions of anthropomorphic animals committing sexual acts, was not against the forum rules in FYAD. When this happened, the poster was usually rebuked if they did not include a warning in the thread's subject text, and perhaps had their preference in [[pornography]] mocked.	 

As time progressed, furry threads continued to be posted, mostly if not solely in FYAD. As FYAD is not intended to have any rules, the posters were not stopped, though they were taunted endlessly by the other members of FYAD. Lowtax one day decided, however, that furry porn would no longer be allowed in FYAD, setting in motion a chain of events later to be known as the "Comedy Lolocaust."	 

As the first step of the Lolocaust, Lowtax created a subforum of "The Goddamn Shithouse" (a place where some FYAD-goers got their own forums and became IK of them) dedicated to the posting of furry porn, called "[[Nazi Furs|The Furry Concentration Camp]]". This kept all furry threads out of FYAD and in one central location. The denizens of this subforum, along with any others proven to have furry tendencies, were then given custom titles of a large yellow star with the title "[[Yiff]]" on top, a reference to a slang term for intercourse in the furry community. Once all of the forum's furries were identified, they were then permanently relegated to the Furry Concentration Camp.	 

The Camp stayed open for a number of weeks, and while furries couldn't leave the forum, others could come in. The Furry Concentration Camp was soon riddled with threads mocking furries in every way, shape and form. However, when these threads began to die down, the furries who could only post in the Camp soon began to congregate with each other, and only with each other. It became a complete community in itself.	 

Eventually, the "final solution" of the Lolocaust was set into place. and the denizens of the FCC were finally banned, effectively ending the mass proliferation of furry porn in FYAD. Currently, anti-furryism is seen as [[old meme]], and in general is not acceptable unless intensely humorous. Furries were, at one point, banned or ostracized, but there are now several forum members known to be furries who are generally accepted within the community.

Also, despite the one-time presence of a "Furry Concentration Camp" subforum, posting racism on SA now is a bannable offense unless the person posting it is a mod/admin, in which case objecting to racism is a bannable offense.

==The Lulzocaust==

[[Image:Lulz ban.jpg|thumb|right|A very lulzy, I mean lolzy, image.]]	

A very special message was left for everyone to read this morning:

''I don't expect everyone to remember every single bannable catchphrase, but just so there is no confusion, the following ones will definitely get you put on probation. Lulz will get you banned. Never use them, even if you going for ironically funny. These are being reported a lot lately, and it's a silly way to lose an account''

''I warned you butts that I was going to be banning anybody who seriously used the stupid catchphrase "lulz" here a long ass time ago, but nobody listened to me!''

''WHY''

''WHY DID YOU NOT LISTEN TO ME''

- The 'Tax

Aside from showing off how he prefers ''catchphrase'' over ''meme'', [[over 9,000]] goons were banned for using lulz, even instances that dated before the message, therefore leaving ED/SA political relations colder than Eskimo [[vagoo]]. Ambassadors are set to make a trade delegation and present a box of [[AIDS]] as a peace offering.

==Gooncon==

Every year when the sun sets, hundreds of goons converge on one city to deplete its precious supply of high fructose corn syrup and ketchup packets.

The cities where Gooncons are hosted see obesity rates rise for the duration of the Gooncon, by far making the poor city the city with the highest obesity rates in the entire nation, if not the entire world.  However, the massive purchasing of fast-food, Twinkies, and Doritos does bump local economies up a notch, although as one shopkeeper was quoted saying, "It's still not worth being near these pitiful fat fucks."

The [[unwarranted self importance|Something Awful]] website charges people Jew or more to attend this thing, although it is so poorly managed you can just walk in. But it is recommended you don a suitable disguise, such as a neckbeard, a videogame related t-shirt, or 150 pounds of excess obesity. Using bacon fat as a shampoo will also help you fit in; the scent may attract one of the few goon [[fat|girls]].

There is usually one party and you will be shunned if you are anything resembling a normal person that is an active member of society.

Also, most [[fag|goons]] are pussies that are like those nerds at parties that just hold a beer to pretend that they are "cool".  And if you drink all the beer they will ask you to leave because you're getting drunk and hitting on the chicks they were just getting ready to [[lie|make a move on.]]  Seriously, just after that next beer.

===Gooncon 2008===
Very recently they only had '''14 people''' descend upon the poor city chosen by the cruel whims of fate. Compare this to the [[at least 100|100 people]] who went to one in the same location, Vegas (which is still recovering from depleted Twinkie resources), 4 years ago.

Its further proof that SA is not popular; this could be due to a variety of reasons, such as SA's status as a humor graveyard, admin and moderator [[emo|histrionics]], or due to the goon population dwindling due to death from obesity and extremely low reproductive rates.

==Old Memes that SA is responsible for==
Note: While Something Awful might be responsible for this unfunny shit, these memes also die there since goons are so inept at life that anything even remotely funny gets beaten into the ground within hours of its inception.  SA nowadays rarely, if ever, spawns memes that leave SA primarily because they became [[unfunny|original]].

==The Great SA forum account hack of 2008 and the Ultimate Lowtax meltdown==
The shitty forums were hacked by none other than the heroes of Hackers United Against Islam.  Around '''40,000''' accounts had their passwords taken due to an [[hax|SQL Injection exploit.]]

It is worth it to point out that a majority of those accounts were inactive, thus proving no one cares about SA anymore. 

Of course Lowtax acted [[butthurt]] and [[Asperger's_Syndrome|Radium]] tried to fix it but they got scared and they were moving with their auntie and uncle to [[Bel Air]].

Then in a stunning turn of events, Lowtax ran away like a bitch not wanting to continue to help his [[aspie]] members get their only source of socialization back or fix their passwords. He gave the keys to Fragmaster.

{{tinyquote|Over the past few weeks/months/years, I have been [[faggotry|investing an increasing amount of time and energy in the forums]], which has caused an equal amount of frustration and annoyance. I feel these negative emotions have not only affected my ability to moderate the forums, but also my capability to write, resulting in a steady decrease of front page creative content.

Simply put, I don't have the energy to continue moderating these forums, and I'd much rather be writing, filming, and spending time with [[azn|my]] [[whore|wife]] and kids ([[shit|#2]] on the way in late April!). I do not feel arguing with [[trolls|people]] for days about trivial, inconsequential issues such as passwords characters or color gradients is an optimal use of my time, and I definitely do not enjoy it.

Looking back, I remember the two reasons I founded Something Awful back in 1999:

[[Shit no one cares about|1) To write.
2) To have fun.]]

Currently I'm doing neither. I feel as if my constant moderation work on the forums has grown into a ball and chain bound to my ankle, weighing me down in everything I do or attempt to do. I'm certain both the forums and myself will benefit by discarding my current forum duties, instead concentrating on the aforementioned two areas.

So how will this affect you? [[failure|Well, it won't.]] I'll be passing the torch on to Kevin "Fragmaster" Bowen, a [[raep|full time employee]] who works in the same office / basement / cat nap room as I. The rest of the mod and admin team will stay the same, and no further changes will be made. The only difference is that I will now be free to concentrate on the things which originally appealed to me: [[shit|writing]], and creating front page content. My already limited role on the forums seems to revolve around [[SASS|growing upset with a vocal minority of people]], a job better left unattended.

Regardless, I'm very excited about this change, and I look forward to having both the time and energy required to write once again. My heart was always in the creative process, not the administrative, so this should be a more beneficial fit for both myself and the forums in general.

Thanks everybody! Have fun, expect to [[fail|win!]]
|Lowtax on the discovery that his forums are made of [[fail]] after 9 fucking years!}}

Of course [[SASS]] had a massive fucking celebration over this [[EPIC WIN|shit.]]
