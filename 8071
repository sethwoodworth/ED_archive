{{squote|'''Usually when I get the urge I walk to my bed and kneel with the cross my grandpa gave me in my hands. I pray for 10 minutes. When I pray I explain to God all the things I'm thinking. All the bad thoughts that go through my head. I explain that I know each one is sin, and give reasons for it. I explain to him that while I know they are wrong to have, I at least came to him first. Then me and him talk for about 20 minutes. '''|You can tell the users are very intelligent.}}

Teensagainstporn.com or TAP (More Like [[Fap]] [[Amirite]]?!?) is an anti-porn website run by [http://www.purecommunity.org Pure Community Ministries Inc.] ([[Sarcasm|Which totally has NO BIAS towards ANYTHING]]). As you can already guess, it's another site run by stuffy preachers to brainwash teens about how porn is going to start World War 3, mark the beginning of an oil crisis, break the internet, destroy mankind and infect all food with HIV. It's users are a bunch of retarded teenagers "rehabilitating" from pr0n addiction.

==Quotes==
<center>{{morphquote|mqtest|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;   
|To me porn isn't freedom. It's bondage.|Totally into S&M

|(Reasons not to look at porn) The images you see in porn will be burned in your brain and pop up randomly, whether you want them to or not.|[[Tubgirl|He may actually have a point there ...]]
    
|God didn't invent orgasms so you could please yourself. He gave it to you so you could enjoy oneness, closeness and intimacy with a woman.| That's right, kids. Every time you jizz all over a tissue, remember that you could have used that jizz onto a woman.

| As a guy, I look at gay porn. I can not remember the last time I saw regular porn. I believe there are two reason for this. One: deep down, when I see the women in porn, I know it's fake. They are fake and disgusting, not like a true women. This is a turn off to me. In gay porn, it's harder to tell, in my opinion, it's fake, mainly because it's hard for me to imagine someone having a gay relationship not just for sex(I know there are, I just can't imagine it). ''I know I am still attracted to women'' | [[Not Gay]] at all !

==The [[Irony]]==
[[File:Anti-Masturbatory Gum.jpg|thumb|Comes in Cold Shower, Dead Kittens and Naked Old Women on a Cold Day flavor.]]

The ironic thing is almost all of the posts on the TAP forum involve a teenager struggling with his / her sexuality. Most of these stories are either stories of the desperate measure they have taken to tame their cocks or that one time they gave in and masturbated over a webcam with a complete stranger. In other words, [[lol|TAP contains more sex stories than most porn sites]].

Another irony? Most teen who suppress their sexuality turn into perverts and child raping priests.
