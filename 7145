A subsidiary of the [http://www.canopy.com/ Canopy Group] and suspected [[sock puppet]] of [[Microsoft]] the '''Santa Cruz Operation''' (SCO) is [[chemotherapy]] for the [[cancer]] that is the [[GPL]]. SCO is the legal owner of the patents infringed upon by the [[Lunix]] operating system, regardless of what [[basement-dweller|basement-dwelling]] [[e-lawyer]] [[Slashdot]] fanboys may say. To legally use [[Lunix]], you must pay a [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|$699 license fee]] to SCO. (A lawsuit is pending against [[Richard Stallman]] for falsely advertising claiming that Lunix is "free software.")

Members of SCO include [[Esker Melchior]].

Note that their messiah, [[Douchebag|Darl]] [[Faggot|McBride]], is a [[Mormon|moron]].

Based in Lindon, Utah, SCO has a worldwide presence with representation in 82 countries. This infrastructure enables SCO to sue anyone who uses Linux without a license, thereby confronting the forces of software piracy in our midst.  SCO has a channel of more than <del>11,000 talking heads, a soon-to-be unemployed development network of 8,000,</del> [[Carlos Sousa Jr|one mexican janitor]], and thousands of direct account customers who are soon to be the object of litigation.  They also have an install base of more than two million obsolete systems.

Currently, SCO is in the process of getting its face smashed by [[IBM]] (and [[You|practically anybody else with a computer and a halfway decent lawyer]]), while selling [[GPL]]ed software on '''OpenServer 6''' -- despite claims that the GPL is unconstitutional and the fact that they now owe [[Novell]] more in licensing fees then OpenServer will ever recoup. In its own cute way, SCO is only doing it for the [[lulz]].

SCO is now basically a lawsuit-machine. However, its lawsuits are about as valid as most internets defamation torts, and so it has become the shared [[lol-cow]] of IBM and the US court system. Once [[Microsoft]] stops supporting it all, the litigation will finally end and all the lawyers will have to get [[Prostitute|real jobs.]]
