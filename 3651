Suddenly dead? Chances are you've been '''Headshot''''d.

A universal indication of [[pwn|pwnage]], a headshot remains a lulzy and popular way of expressing your dislike for someone. Originating from FPS games like [[Counter-Strike|Counter-Strike]], the head was the target that caused the most damage. [[Anon]], being the special kid that he is, found great lulz in the idea that this fact held true IRL.



This particular shot is a special and precious thing because the head in most cases, but definitely not in the case of [[Argent009]], presents a smaller and hence harder target to hit than the body. To truly qualify for the "Headshot" accolade, a shot therefore needs 
# to be to the head, and 
# to be taken from a distance of at least one yard.
# [[????]]
# [[PROFIT!]]

Many believe that "BOOM HEADSHOT" warcry originated from FPS Doug, co-star of the [[interweb]] show Pure Pwnage

* King Harold with an arrow in 1066, perhaps the earliest recorded headshot
* [[Fat whore|Monica Lewinski]]
