"'''SWAT'''ting," or "Swatting," is basically the definition of [[serious business]]. It is a method of pwning others [[IRL]], but at the same time it is most often attempted by [[internet tough guys|people]] whom, generally speaking, can't get anything done.  Most Swatting attempts [[fail|go nowhere]] and if you don't know what you're doing you could end up with visit from the [[partyvan]] yourself.  
 
The point of a [[SWAT]] attempt is to troll  a local police forces' [[1337]], lethal, [[SFB|super cereal]] SWAT ('''Special Weapons And Tactics''') team into becoming your [[personal army]] and send them into action by directing them to [[raid]] your unsuspecting target's home. This hopefully results in all manner of drama and lulz featuring helicopters with blinding searchlights waking up the entire neighbourhood, a blockade of armoured personal carriers surrounding the vic's house, [[Jenkem|tear gas]] and flashbang grenades getting lobbed through their (closed) windows, a front door smashed to pieces after being levelled with a battering ram, followed by dozen or more heavily armed [[IRL tough guy]]s in body armour with itchy trigger fingers and snarling attack dogs and -ultimately- your death after a sudden move. If you ''are'' lucky enough to make it out of this sticky situation alive somehow, you will end up eternally shunned and mocked by your family, the neighbours and your peers.

tl;dr: A '''SWAT''' raid is [[typical]]ly executed via caller ID [[h4x|spoofing]] in conjunction with a little [[social engineering]] to convince the authorities to [[raid]] the target's home. A SWAT raid executed properly is the ultimate in using an IRL [[personal army]] to do your [[trolling IRL|bidding]] and will either end in tears, Ã¼ber [[pwn]]age or death...or all three.

It has become much more prevalent tactic of [[i|/i/]]nsurgents in the last 2 years or so, primarily due to the recent influx of faggots whom believe they're the new [[USI|1337 trollgods]] of the [[interwebs]]. 

===Security Measures===
It should be noted that whilst your [[dog curtains]] may well be your best and [[firewall|first line of defence]] against the [[steroidal hackers]] of the [[Internet Hate Machine]], [[a dog|buying a dog]] will not help you when a SWAT team rappels through you bedroom window. Fido is no match for a .50 cal Browning Machine Gun.

Although it doesn't really require any extreme technical [[skillz|proficiency]] to pull it off, most who attempt it either are too [[skiddies|inexperienced]], incapable of convincing the authorities, or just prone to [[troll's remorse|bitching out]] at any sign of trouble.  So, many Swatting attempts go nowhere...[http://www.cato.org/raidmap/ but don't feel too safe].
