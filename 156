'''ARS''' aka '''[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology alt.religion.scientology]''' is an old school [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] discussion board which - since its inception in 1991 until [[last Thursday]] - was the 'Church' of [[Scientology]]'s main source of severe [[butthurt]] in life. It was founded by [[Kelly Martin]] before Kelly had the sex change and changed her name to female.

Mainly populated by long-time 'church' [[trolls|critics]] like [[Magoo]], [[Wise Beard Man]] and '''Greg Haggalund''', as well as other [[normal]] people, it has trolled the fuck out of the [[coS|House of L. Ron]] for years and has constantly [[pwnt]] Scientology's feeble attempt at retaliation in the form of massive amounts of [[spam]] and [[lolsuits]]. 

==Scientology vs the Internets==

===Round 1===

In 1995 the [[Co$]]'s well paid Jew lawyers tried to have the whole group [[911|removed from Usenet]] which led to much much [[rofl]] and [[GTFO]].

{{quote|We request that you remove the '''alt.religion.scientology''' newsgroup from your site. The reasons for requesting its removal are: '''(1)''' It was started with a [[LOL WUT|forged message]]; '''(2)''' not discussed on alt.config; '''(3)''' it has the name "[[Scientology]]" in its title which is [[lolcow|a trademark and is misleading]], as a.r.s. is mainly used for [[flame]]rs to [[victim complex|attack the Scientology religion]]; '''(4)''' it has been and continues to be [[BAW|heavily abused with copyright and trade secret violations]] and serves no purpose other than condoning these illegal practices.|Co$ scheister}}

Usenet [[sysops]] reacted by [[NO U|ignoring it]], mainly [[I did it for the lulz|For the lulz]], but the resulting drama and publicity led to a hueg influx of [[noobs]] and provided all the ingredients for some [[delicious cake]] made of [[rAIDS]] after the 1337 [[hackers]] of the [[Cult of the Dead Cow]] declared war on Scientology.

===Round 2===

'''ARS''' recently became quite popular again in mid-January 2008 when the [[Marcab]]ian minions of [[Anonymous]] issued a fatwa on [[L. Ron]]'s arse and declared [[eJihad]] on them with [[Project Chanology]]. As a result, Anons swarmed ARS (as well as [[pwn]]ing [[Enturbulation]]'s forums) to bring [[DESU]] and [[the lulz]] to the old crusaders in an otherwise [[boring|staid]] corner of the Interwebs. Browsing ARS these days is something akin to getting [[Rickroll]]d at a poetry reading.
