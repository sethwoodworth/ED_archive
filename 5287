Meh
[[File:nope.jpg]]

Along with Feh, [[teh]], Pfft, and Blech, this word adds instant juvenile flavor to your [[internets]] conversation. It also owns your mother. These are all noises made by orifices that would in proper company be considered rude but are tolerated on [[blogs]] and highly respected by [[LJ Users]]. It's used to concisely express the tone in which the writer is transcribing, when attitudes might otherwise be unknown due to constraints with word usages in the bland field of text-based communication.

Meh is a statement of apathy. To imagine it being said, picture a 400-pound, balding, depressed man staring slack-jawed at a television, which is the only light in the room as he's taped tinfoil over his basement suite windows. Then imagine a show coming on that he doesn't enjoy, but alas, he is too fat and maggot-like to reach for the remote control on the coffee table two feet away. After a few minutes he realizes what is happening. His response is to produce one mushy syllable from his Dorito-encrusted mouth, and there you have it:

"Meh."

Meh is not to be confused with "meeh" which is a variant of the word 'me' typically used by fat preps. If you see anyone saying 'meeh' you are morally required to stab them multiple times in every non-lethal section of the body with a broken broomstick making sure to twist it around on each final stab as if churning butter and then leave them to die from blood loss.

'Feh' is a term that indicates dismissal or disagreement. The pronunciation is similar in tone to "Naaaaah". 'Bleh' and 'Blech' add a bit more disgust to the tone as opposed to the cheerier notes of disagreement. [[You|Retards]] also use "Mlah" for the same purpose.
