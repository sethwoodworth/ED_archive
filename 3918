I am aware of all internet traditions
[[Image:I am aware of all internet traditions.jpg|thumb|The original!]]
"I am aware of all internet traditions" achieved meme status in June of 2008, after commenter Vanderleun left the following comment on a "[[Shorter]]" post on [http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/06/thanks-to-911-shes-outraged-by.html#583742 Lawyers, Guns, and Money.]

 As a participant in the thread that follows the link to neoneocon, I should
 like to point out that the quote you excerpted
 
 does not exist
 
 in neoneocon’s post. Nor does it exist in the comments.

When the [[shorter]] concept is explained, he/she replies:

 I am aware of all internet traditions and also of literary conventions in 
 which placing something in quotes or in a blockquote means that your are 
 quoting that person.
 
 But here you are not.
 
 It seems to me that what your are about is, well, sort of questionable.
 
 Can you please expand on the idea your propose that putting something in
 blockquotes that does not appear at the linked item is a fair thing to do.
 
This was picked up by a number of blogs, including [http://www.balloon-juice.com/?p=10643 Balloon Juice], [http://gawker.com/tag/the-internets/?i=5018163&t=i-am-aware-of-all-internet-traditions Gawker], and [http://wonkette.com/400614/i-am-aware-of-all-internet-traditions Wonkette], and spread throughout the blogosphere. The meme promised an underwhelming performance on the tubes until a few days later an aide to [[John McCain]] coincidentally [http://www.balloon-juice.com/?p=10684 put his] [http://thepoorman.net/2008/06/24/but-the-traditions-man-what-about-the-traditions/ foot in it] by unwittingly (nitwittingly, if you prefer) parroting Vanderleun:

 "John McCain is aware of the Internet,” says Soohoo. “This is a man who has a
  very long history of understanding on a range of issues.”

The aide did not clarify if these issues covered literary conventions because...whatever. And so instead of dying quickly the meme lives in misery to this day.
