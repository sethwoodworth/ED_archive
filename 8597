Twitterbook
{{stub}}

'''Twitterbook''' is the unholy and -as yet- unconsummated union of [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] which '''''everyone''''' has and is commonly referred to as (the) '''Social Media'''. You can't have one without the other and if have neither or only one or the other you are a giant [[loser]]. 

While they are still single, you can either check out:

*[[Failbook]]

or

*[[Shitter]]

The undisputed '''King of All Social Media''' is [[Rick Sanchez]]...even though the [[Jews]] recently tried to crucify him for preaching the [[tweet|gospel]].
