Usually the YouTube [[cesspool]] is known for housing all manner of [[fugly]], [[fat|obese]], and [[batshit insane|psychotic]] "[[vlog]]gers" on the [[Internet]]. Offering solace to nearly every variance of [[USI|misplaced megalomania]], and satisfying a desperate need for [[so ronery|e-friends]] shared by every YouTube [[lolcow]].  So it isn't uncommon when these all clash on a site which functions as a nexus for every recessive trait in the human gene pool.  {{youtube2|Jasonspeaks|Jasonspeaks}} is prime example of this - a fragile Mexican "[[aspie|carebear]]" [[troll]] with an extensive history of [[schizophrenic|passive-aggressive]] online [[faggotry]].  He's [[notable]] only for being one of YouTube's most shameless, [[bipolar]] [[manboy]]s and for having the appearance of a portly [[bull-dyke]] with [[Santorum|facial hair]]. More importantly he [[fail]]ed the [[good person test]]. Jason [[fail]]ed it because of his skewed frame of reference; it's okay to pick on [[Vietnam]] Veterans, but not his own children [[anonymous]]ly.   

==A Brief History of Faggotry==
[[Image:Jasonspeaks manboy clothes lulz.jpg|thumb|right|"Hey mang, git da fuck away frum my lawnmower esé!"]]
A former [[EDiot]] [[User:Jasonspeaks]] is an embarrassment to even himself. Just like his other e-friends in [[phail]]ure  [[User:BikeRace|Amber]], [[User:Crownaffair|Hope]], and of course [[User:Jebbi3|''Jebbi3'']]. Jason's passion for [[vlog]]ging brought him to the Internet not long after he went to his local [[faux|news]] station to [http://web.archive.org/web/20070126233558/http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/10478572/detail.html register complaints] over negative [[YouTube]] comments he was receiving on videos he posted of his [[child abuse|children]].  Jason was upset that anonymous YouTube users were [[gtfo|criticizing]] him and decided to go to his local news channel to [[bawww|whine]] about the misfortune of the many oh-so-nasty [[text]] comments he was receiving.  The [[lollercoaster]] took off from there.  Thus Jason -- a man who's displayed no problem trolling others in the past -- possesses a disturbing "[[online]]" [[victim complex]], and is apparently quite sensitive to 1 star [[honorz|ratings]] or any reference to his overwhelmingly disgusting [[IRL]] appearance.  He's enjoyed searching for [[desperate|e-pals]] whilst venting [[frustration]]s over spilt milk via the tubes for about 2 1/2 years now and his YouTube [[fail|experience]] can be summated as a lengthy process of him stewing in his own juices over "[[haters]]".  This has been the grounding for Jason's faggotry during his days as a YouTube "vlogger" and thing such as this are [[typically]] a consequence of his ineffectual [[rage|e-rage]] when things don't seem work out.   
[[Image:Jasonspeakzewwworly.jpg|left|thumb|[[IRL]] keyboard tough guy.]] Jason can often be caught making melodramatic "[[irony|I don't want drama]]" videos when he isn't uploading extremely [[boring]] content and can usually be found [[lurk]]ing for any whiff of online [[drama]] to not partake in.  

Jason was also featured as the {{youtube2|YourTubeAdvocate|YourTubeAdvocate}} "Community" channel host (a result of one of [http://www.youtube.com/user/theestranger Theestranger's] less-than-thought out decisions as it turns out) during the month of July, 2007.  His role as the YouTube Community's "advocate" was a point of [[controversy]] not only as a result of his sketchy online antics before and after his tenure but also because in a video Jason {{youtube|fLXAexj_6T4|defended}} [[Young Tubers United]] (whilst saying "[[epic]]" and [[pro-tip]] about 10 times, of course) -- which is all very interesting since Jason actually [[trolled]] YTU himself and pretended to be [[Michael Jackson]] on a [[prank call|Snapvine]] call.  Months of faggotry later, Jason decided to [[ragequit|close]] his YouTube channel in early [[2008]] due to high levels of [[butthurt]] over spilt milk.  Somewhat later, realizing life offline was a little [[no life|static]], he returned to [[spam|produce]] more [[stop posting|informative]], [[TL;DR|lengthy]], and [[no|entertaining]] "vlogs" for the [[retards|myopic]] and stunted YouTube users [[naive]] enough to actually buy the façade.  

But Jason isn't [[old]] at all though - he's hip, he's cool, he's a dad who's just like the kids.  And he loves those crazy, zany things they're into these days -- you know, those [[meme]] thingies.  And he can often be spotted abusing any and all possible when trying to [[Trying too hard|fit in]] with other online [[so ronery|e-buddies]].  Either that or he will continue to believe he is actually friends with [[sysop]]s like [[user:zenophile808|Zenophile808]], and worse, that he is actually relevant anymore.  Jason is a little bit of a spoilt [[child]] though, and his tact for being trolled has [[typically]] remained that of a misguided [[manchild]], paradoxically attempting [[moralfag|high ground]] whilst surreptitiously creating [[sockpuppet]] armies and engaging in surgical efforts to attempt some pointless "e-revenge" on his perceived e-nemies who seem to care little about him to begin with.

Originally titled '''"Local Family Attacked By YouTube Viewers"''', the following video depicts a YouTube user with [[trolls remorse]].  This is from a local San Diego [[old media|news channel]], and there's even article online about the "tragedy". It's important to note; for whatever reason, '''Jason does not want [[you]] to see this video'''. Which is odd since the video is readily available on the [[Internet]] page.  Go figure, [[proxy|guilt]] maybe ?! [[Cool Story Bro]]!

==Penis Shark==

[[Image:Jason failsit.jpg|right|thumb|No 'sharks' here, just a fat fuck with no skillz.]]
Sometime before [[2008]], Jasonspeaks took it upon himself to attack [[Internet]]s drama llama [[User:Mikeskehan|Mike Skehan]]. Jason was pissed as fuck that Mike was collecting [[moar]] titty pictures than he previously expected ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3NZkarkhFE]). As shown from his various [[social networking]] profiles, Jason ''is'' and ''was'' only around for the major [[boob]]age. Thus, Jason felt he had no choice but to attempt to [[ruin]] Mike and exploit online [[drama]] before Mike got his dirty little fingers on [[porn|epic noodz]]. While this gave Jason some notoriety and brought up his [[YouTube]] view counts, it had some extremely negative side effects. His plan backfired when he suggested that Skehan "jumped the shark"; which in turn would have [[troll]]s everywhere suddenly wanting to know who exactly Jasonspeaks is and why he championed [[anti-lulz]]. Jason's only saving grace was that Skehan began to focus moar on [[IRL]] [[troll]]ing. Nevertheless, Jason forgot that it's pointless to continue to "[[Trolls trolling trolls|troll a troll]]", because Skehan "jumped the shark" the day he bought a [[computer]]. When not walking around with the e-guilt of [[fuck]]ing with Skehan, Jason can be found repeating Mike's [[catchphrase]]s and creating boring YouTube [[sock puppet|sock accounts]] like {{youtube2|Unclehankftw|Unclehankftw}}.

The following [[military]] hero below ({{youtube2|Cyber9Rounder1|Cyber9Rounder1}} ), is an [[IRL]] [[Vietnam]] Veteran that turned Jason's [[The_Fresh_Prince_of_Bel-Air|world upside down]].
