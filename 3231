Gargoyle
[[Image:Gargcriteria.jpg|thumb|How to determine if something is a [[furry]]/[[otherkin]] or if it is an actual gargoyle]]
Often [[male]], sometimes [[gay]], sometimes neuter, ''gargoyles'' are winged creatures that get their [[ass]] up on a building pissing on [[everyone]] below. 

They are noble guardians. They are rarely found on the [[Internets]] as your care cup is empty. If you see a [[demon]] that is [[stoned]], it may become a gargoyle. Most gargoyles are pure bred, while some are conversions.

== Disney ==
These faggots have wings for ears, lack pecs, lack penises, lack abs, wear [[shit]], have fucking human hair, live in [[New York]], are gay, and the fans are dumb [[Furry|furries]]. The Disney image of the gargoyle has totally corrupted the minds of [[everyone]].

The Disney gargoyle communities can usually be found in sites communicating via news comments of an obsolete php chatroom, all in obsolete 1996-esque designed sites. They also [[roleplay]] and [[cosplay]] and even have a special Gargcon which raises the faggot percent by 7000[[%]]. 

== Furry ==
Gargoyles are not [[furry]], but however furries and [[otherkin]] who draw them give them large penises. They are usually of Disney origin and bastardized.

The majority of these are found in [[DeviantArt]] and [[SheezyArt]].
