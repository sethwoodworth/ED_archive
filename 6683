'''[http://www.dwainecaraway.com/ Dwaine Caraway]''' has a bold vision for the future of the city of Dallas, devoting his life to fighting the [http://www.dwainecaraway.com/newsletter_pages/nhood_nls/joppa_cm.html urban evils] of dangerous stray dogs, hourly hot-sheet motels, and decaying sidewalks. As Deputy Mayor Pro Tem, his job is support [[law|legislation]] that rephrases unenforced city code in new and exciting ways. His most vulgar target to date are the saggy baggy pants that are all the rage with kids these days. This fashion menace assaults property values and turns the community into a beacon for raging homosexual predators.... but more on this later. The only thing that managed to stop Caraway's proposed trouser ordinance was a teeny bit of pesky constitutional law and the fact that such a thing could be construed as racial profiling since there's just not as many white people out ghetto waddling around on the streets.

After Dallas area gospel rapper '''[http://trupraisepros.tripod.com/id25.htm Duwayne "Dooney" Brown]''' saw Caraway's plight unfold on local television, he was inspired to take the battle for fashion decency directly to the streets and win  the hearts and minds of his brothers through music. He locked himself in a closet for several hours to develop his idea, emerging at 3 A.M. that same night with a completed musical masterpiece. He then claimed the [http://www.myspace.com/pullyourpantsupman PullYourPantsUpMan myspace], updated his stage name to '''"Dooney da Priest"''', and recorded the new single.

Finished product in hand, the young rapper presented his work to Caraway. The politician green-lighted the project, only requesting a single edit to remove the word "Gay" from Dooney's lyrics. Caraway then forced Clear Channel radio to sponsor a few "Pull Your Pants Up" billboards that began to pop up around Dallas.

== On The Down Low : The Things You Learn In Prison ==

An estimated 95% of the population thinks that when you '''"Keep It On The Down Low"''', you've got a wild booty call that your main girl don't know about and ain't gonna know about it, cuz you and her are keeping your mouths shut. Keeping a low profile. Keeping it on the down low. Credit R. Kelly, the pissing pedophile rapper, for popularizing this term amongst scores of kids in the 90's.

Baggy pants were a prison standard in the early 20th century... If inmates had access to belts, they would more than likely use them to beat the crap out of each other or hang themselves to death. Technologies like elastic helped fix this problem, but even today the style remains among homosexual inmates. They tend to wear their pants well below the hips, as this gives potential studs quick and easy access to their butt, and anyone can effortlessly reach inside and sample the tightness of their sphincter. In prison, "Keeping It On The Down Low" is a very literal term.

Keep this in mind as you read the lyrics or listen to the song.

== Pull Your Pants Up - Earlier Lyrics ==

Prior to the final edit, the lyrics highlighted above in blue were 

 I think it's '''gay''', but some of you think it's cool,
 walking around showinâ€™ your behind to other dudes.

The [http://www.tapescrew.com/audio/Pull-Your-Pants-Up-Gay.mp3 original version] is available for download. These lyrics are at the 2:31 mark.

== Gays Get Pissed ==
{|
|A blog at National Public Radio covered the campaign in one of their posts, and a number of [http://www.glaad.org/media/newspops_detail.php?id=4084 attentive homosexuals] that actually read the lyrics noticed that they were getting slammed by the "down low" line. They also got [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15654565 all pissed] at [[bullshit|suggestions]] that there is something inherently wrong with being gay, and that men shouldn't be looking at the backside of other men.

Dooney promptly posted an apology to the entire gay community, saying that the song was not explicitly meant to be an attack on them, but rather to inform those who never intended to waddle the streets looking like the prison bitch. He pointed out that his informative slant was backed up by the "saggin spelled backwards is the N-word" line, which has nothing to do with homosexuality and everything to do with a mix of racial and socioeconomic bigotry.

{{squote|What I'm saying is not being gay is uncool, I think it's the fact that 80% of the young men on the street are ignorant of the fact of what it truly means and so my thing is to educate them. '''Now rather if their sexual preference is to be a gay or be a homosexual, that's their own <u>problem</u>.'''|Dooney| on how if you gonna be gay, that's your problem}}

== The Original Pull Your Pants Up ==
{|
|valign="top"|Contrary to everything '''Dooney''' claimed in interviews, "Pull Your Pants Up" wasn't always a homophobic anthem. It was originally written by kid-friendly rapper "[[pedophile|Six 8]]" in 2006, and it actually had much better lyrics and vocals before Dooney blatantly ripped off the beat and title. 

'''Six 8''' confirmed that he had only recently learned about the Dallas version of pull your pants up, but doesn't much care, since he's on the [[buttsex|grind]], doing his own thing.

<small>Trivia: The name "Six 8" refers to the rapper's dicksize, as in 68 cm. This is a form of compensation, albeit not a subtle one, much like men who drive big/expensive cars.</small>

== The Billboard Problem ==
[[Image:Billboardcampaign.gif|thumb|right|[[Your]]e' retarded.]]One complaint that Dallas City Hall received about the Pull Your Pants Up campaign billboards indicated that they fucked up the apostrophe, which should read like...

<big><big>Pull'em Up</big></big>

... instead of ...

<big><big>Pullem' Up</big></big>

In short, the campaign is directly contributing to the grammatical delinquency of our youth.
