{{needsmoar|wiki vandalism and trolling of stupid parents}}

'''GotATeenager''' is yet another [[Trying too hard|failed attempt]] by [[British]] parents to understand their [[wigger|white suburban children]]â€™s attempts at [[Ebonics|nigger speak]] and their hedonistic lifestyle. The site is mainly comprised of [[fucktard|fucktarded]] "parents" who failed to beat the [[Chav]]/[[Ebonics|ebonic]] douchebaggery out of their [[you|offspring]]. The [[fag|author of the site]] made it even more difficult for himself because no self-respecting teenager (wut?) would listen to their parents' constant whining in the first place.

== Jargon Buster ==
The site contains a <s>dictionary</s> [[bible]] of [[over 9000]] [[IRL]] [[memes]] that enable [[fucktarded]] parents (or [[LOL WUT|"rents"]] as the site abbreviates) to look up bastardized phrases that inner-city [[bix nood]] kids were using in [[Niggers|Detroit]] [[at_least_100_years_ago|in the 1980's]].  This website gets its [[lulz]] by permitting any little [[shit]] to sell out his peers by posting new [[memes]] and their definitions with little to no moderation, effectively copying this site and everything ED stands for.

[[Image:Chavandchavette.jpg|thumb|right|'''STOP TALKING LIKE A NIGGER! YOU'RE FROM THE UK.''']]

The jargon buster includes such gems as:
*[[An hero]]: Someone who [[fails|excels]] at aspects of life. ([[LOLWUT]])
*[[JB|Bait]]: An [[Prostatot|underage woman who is seen as sexually provocative]]. Shortened term of [[Jailbait]].
*[[Woman|Babe]]: A not as romantic or warm word as 'Sweetheart' or '[[Ebaumsworld|ebaum]]'...supposed to make the boy/girl feel loved.
*[[Barrel Roll]]: Greatly Appreciated and/or thoughtful advice. Example: "thanks for the barrel roll, mate"
*[[Pedobear|Bear]]: Good, as in "That was bear good." Also meaning many: [[Pedobear]] means many pedophiles.
*[[BAWWWW]]: Used to mock some one who is [[asking for it|whining]]. Example: BAAAWWWW [[noone|NO ONE]] CARES!
*[[so cash|Cash]]: A way of indicating something great or awesome. Example: Shit was [[so cash|SO CASH]]
*[[Goatse|GoatSee]]: For a [[16 year old girl|teenage girl]] or group of teenaged girls to check out (and often flirt with) other teenaged boys growing out their beards (a play on the word "goatee"). 
*[[IMMA_CHARGIN_MAH_LAZER|Lazer]]: Slang term for ejaculation. The phrase "chargin mah lazer [sic]" is commonly used to refer to (male) masturbation.
*[[Woman]]: What you call your girlfriend. [[fact|Interchangeable for bitch]].

[[At least 100]] of the so called "words" found here call into question the mental state of today's youth, and make [[You|one]] doubt what kind of [[An_hero|person]] the teens who use these words will grow up to be. What's worse is that the "words" in this [[bible]] lack the slightest bit of creativity and are reminiscent of <s>[[Tom Cruise]] in "I JUMP ON OPUHS COUCHEZ"</s> [[Dane Cook]]. I swear, it's syntax [[holocaust|genocide]]. Of course, none of this can actually be classified as [[Ebonics]] as the speakers do not wear South Pole apparel.

== Trolling possibilities ==
Aside from the open dictionary, gotateen also provides a hotline that parents can call to ask questions about [[Battletoads|their teens]] and share their [[Sob_story|inspirational stories]] with other parents.
Don't forget to stop by the message boards and share pictures of your [[muddy dicks|darling children and the horrible things they do]]. Of course, [[pedophile|pedos]] won't fap to them.

== Comics ==
Gotateenager also contains a comic strip on par with [[Law 4 Kids]]. The comic improperly advises parents on [[Suicide|how to deal with their uncivilized little shits]]. Situations include promoting teen drinking, and singling your child out from his peers. It suggests communication and understanding as a means to properly parent children. The entire site should actually be replaced by this: [http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=beat Maddox: Love your kids? Prove it by beating them.]
