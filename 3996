In memoriam
[[Image:Fail poster.jpg|thumb|right|Shitty poster.]]


In Memoriam a film by Stephen Cone, is about the life and times of Captain Diptard MaGee (aka Captain McCreepy) as he attempts to battle internet lols by getting [[butthurt]] and then making a film about two [[Darwin Award]] recipients.  

==PLOT==
The film starts out with a random [[French]] guy who has nothing to do with anything gabbling about how much he wants to [[rape|bang]]  the chick holding the camera, or basically what you would expect from any Frenchmen.  The film goes downhill from there. 
We are introduced to our main character, [[Chris-chan|Captain Diptard]], who is on a stage [[fail|acting]] with his [[larp|improv]] group. He and his closeted dyke girlfriend then drive back to his place where he talks with a random bitch [[blowjob|smoking]] outside his apartment. After that the viewers are subjected to watching Captain Diptard’s nightly routine of eating, showering, fapping, and then attempting to read.  Unfortunately, due to his extreme [[aspie|retardation]], he can not understand the words in the book in front of him, so he gives up and goes to sleep.

The next morning he receives an email about two naked drunken college students who [[anhero|fell off of a roof]]. Not understanding the symbols on the screen he runs to his next door neighbor who informs him that his email was about the great justice of Darwin.  Fearing that he too might fall off a roof, Captain Diptard spirals into a depression where he lashes out at everyone who points out how stupid he is for becoming obsessed with two people he didn’t even know who died doing something unbelievably stupid.

Since the Captain [[basement dweller|doesn’t have a life]] he goes to the dead people’s [[Facebook]] pages and [[internet stalking|prints out pictures]] of them which he [[necrophilia|hangs on his wall during a montage complete with shitty music.]] His girlfriend confronts him about it, then leaves when she realizes that there isn’t a point to trying to reason with someone who bathes in their own feces for fun. The smoking bitch outside the building then attempts to get in the dyke’s pants. 

Captain Diptard, upon finding out  as much as he can about the Darwin Award recipients, decides that there must be more to their deaths and emerges from his mother’s basement to bother the family and friends of the two dead people he is stalking.  

He finds out that, had he spoken to the police to begin with, he would have found out that yes, the people were drunk, and yes, they did fall from a roof. Instead of leaving it at that, he goes to the families of the dead people and [[legit|creeps around their houses]], looking in the dead people’s rooms for vibrators. Upon finding a vibrator, he licks it and shoves it up his ass.  

Having lost his point of existing in a movie, Captain Diptard crawls back to his mother’s basement and faps to [[Brian Peppers|midget pron]]. While fapping, he gets a great idea. He will make a movie about the two people who got naked while they were drunk and took someone’s advice to go fuck on a roof.  He also want to show everyone the [[retard|“final, silly, beautiful,”]] moment of the two, because hitting a sidewalks from 60 stories up is so gorgeous, right guys?
The rest of the movie is pretty much [[tl;dr]], with Captain Diptard getting a bunch of people together to make the [[9/11|“reenactment.”]] Instead of finding actors who look like Darwin’s whores, he chooses an [[Italian]] and a black person who the dead girl’s mother decides to adopt. They film the “reenactment,”  completing it with [[fur suit|puppet sex]] and then the movie continues to drag it ass through their rap party.

==OVERALL IMPRESSION==
This movie needed a good editor to remove an hour and half of its two hour length, or even a great editor who would know to [[KILL IT WITH FIRE.]]  The musical score was a horrible colon storm filled with saxo-fail and a dash of Beethoven for when the Captain is fapping. The acting is horrible and the writing is terrible, but at least it distracts from the shitty handling of the camera. 

Most people will be begging for the movie to stop when it is only half way through.

==THE DIRECTOR, PRODUCER, WRITER==
After being subjected to this movie, the audience might have to sit through the endless anal wind that is the speech of Stephen Cone. I say this because most viewers will have been forced to watch it for some college class as it is the only way that this ass clown can get normal people to see it. Those not forced to watch it and who like may resemble Ben Stiller’s retarded Uncle and angrily bitch out people more intelligent than themselves before going back to work on their [[Sonichu movie]].  

According to Mr. Cone, he is sickened by the lols on the internet and thinks it’s terrible that someone would make fun of two drunk people who got naked and failed at having sex on a wet slanted 60 story roof.  Mr. Cone also wanted to point out that he doesn’t understand why everyone is so sarcastic anymore, and that it makes his life difficult because he is too dumb to understand when people are mocking him. He also wanted to make a film that was sincere about the human condition and that had a personal meaning to him.  He then went on to say that he has tried to write things that didn’t have anything to do with him, but got bored 5 pages in because it had nothing to do with anything in his life.  What a humble human being.

==THE MAIN ACTOR==
Ian Forester, the actor who played Captain Diptard was attracted to working on this movie because Stephen Cone gives great blowjobs to his cast. But what really hooked him was the line in the movie where Captain Diptard says to the gathered people watching his movie, “We’re sitting here, and one day we won’t be, and that’s okay.” He was also attracted to the concept of “allowing oneself to risk one’s life with another,” which he applied to the two Darwin Award recipients. He fails to realize that that idea is only romantic when those involved have a cause to risk their lives for, instead of just wanting a drunken fuck.

==YOU CAN HELP THIS FILM==
According to Mr. Cone, this film has yet to get into any film festivals but he “got back letters saying that they liked the movie but…” And since this is an “independent film,” Mr. Cone needs to gain back the $67 dollars he sunk into it, so he would really like [[blowjob|word of mouth]] to help get this movie out to the public. Help encourage Mr. Cone by visiting his and his film's Facebook page below. 
Mr. Cone is considering making a sequel to this film about a Captain Diptard searching for [[Mitchell Henderson]]'s Ipod.
