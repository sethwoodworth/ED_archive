'''Nyoro~n''', sometimes known as '''Hurricane Nyoron''', is a [[lame]] [[image macro]] at [[4chan]]. It's basically a picture of an ugly, green-haired, [[16-year-old girl|16-year-old]] [[anime]] [[Bridget|girl]] named Tsuruya-san with text next to it, which, invariably, ends with "nyoro~n". The sauce was her asking for smoked cheese, then being told she ate it all, followed by a sad Nyoro~n or sigh.

The text is usually just randomly recycled crap from a previous post. Single ''nyoro~n'' images are often used multiple times in different threads. Such nyoro~n images are generated by an application called '''/b/-post'''.

[[/b/]] was being flooded with it [[Last Thursday|last thursday]], causing leakage into other imageboards and pissing off hordes of [[7chan|pretentious fucks]] with [[XBox|hueg]] [[Jam It In|e-p0n0ses]].

Recently, it has been revealed that a version of the Nyoro~n program was modified so that a trojan virus was included which would write 0s to the hard disk as the program ran. This [[pwned]] lots of really irritating copypastaing [[Gaia]]fags.

==Origins==
Nyoro~n is a catchphrase from ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'', and came into prominence when a group of pedophiles lurking in the darkness of [[Something Awful]]'s Anime Death Tentacle Rape Nyoro~nhouse decided to do some evangelism and bought [[over 9000]] banners in an attempt to convince the goons that [[pedophile|pedophilia]] is totally cool. Everyone got sick of it, some [[Retard|Nyoro~ntard]]s with too much money on their hands bought counter-banner-ads about how much banner-ads suck, and the meme was soon forgotten. Then, as often happens, some troglodyte or [[Moot]] dug it out of the trash, wiped it off, glued on some googly eyes and pink pipe-cleaner antennae, and proceeded to parade it around 4chan in a [[fail]]ed attempt to become the next [[Raptor Jesus]].

==Tsundeban==
Tsundeban is a parody combining Tsundere with the Taliban, featured in a series of Korean 4-koma meant to criticize the indecision of the Taliban, after the kidnapping of 23 Korean Christians in July [http://comipress.com/article/2007/07/30/2396]. The hostages were released in late August according to Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_South_Korean_hostage_crisis_in_Afghanistan], which makes the meme both notable and referenced, and must now be included in as many articles as possible...........nyoro~n    

==Nyoro Nyolo==
A heavily reposted flash usually called nyoronyolo.swf has been circulating on the chans, and it uses some music from some PSP game developed by Sony. Due to its wide success, the song used is probably the only lasting achievement of Sony, despite it simply being Nyoro~n and in a rather simple, retarded flash......nyoro~n.

==Animated Series!==
In early 2009, Japanese animation studio Kadokawa decided to [[rape|milk]] [[Haruhi]] for all it's worth, proving that anything as mundane and insignificant as a failed meme can be taken too far.
