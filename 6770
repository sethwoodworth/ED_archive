'''Rachel Maddow''' ([[moar]] [[liek]] [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:LOL_rachel_maddow.jpg Rachel MAN-dow], [[amirite]]?) is a politics-obsessed bulldyke who hosts a vapid talk show. She's like a male [[Keith Olbermann]] who somehow manages to be even less interesting. She's best known for loving [[your_mom|women]], seducing wannabe dyke [[Keith Olbermann]], pwning [[Republican]]s (as long as they aren't there to defend themselves) and [[fucking|drooling over]] Ana(l) Marie Cox. Rachel Maddow is [[raped|loved]] by all members of [[liberal]] media, who enjoy watching a show about a borderline retarded dyke whose idea of debating is making unfunny comments about people from the safety of her (notably empty) studio.

Rachel is a minority among [[liberal]] television personalities in that she is the only commentator who has tasted pussy. She [[nevar]] [[Chris Crocker|gets angry]], [[Bill_O_Reilly|yells at people who disagree with her]] or [[Kanye West|disses anyone]] who isn't [[asking for it]], remaining calm (i.e. boring) to express her [[leftard|point of view]]. Even though she's an obvious lesbian, she [[nevar]] talks about gays. Despite her [[faggotry|gayness]], [[Democrat|liberals]], [[bisexual|moderates]], [[straight]] people and [[niggas]] can [[orgy|all enjoy her show]] if they can stay awake between commercial breaks.

[[Last Thursday|Not too long ago]], [[Keith Olbermann]] went [[batshit crazy|temporarily insane]] and the [[liberal|MSNBC]] [[Matt lush|Gods]] appointed Rachel Maddow to fill in for him while he was [[bondage|locked up]] in a mental institution. Since she is so [[hot|good at what she does]] and because [[truth|Keith Olbermann is in love with her]] she received her own show, [[Win|taking over Dan Abrams' time slot]]. [[Some argue|It is speculated]] that nothing of value was lost.

Her television show, creatively titled [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/ The Rachel Maddow Show], is on [[shit|MSNBC]] [[at least 100]] times a day and is always on right after [[Keith Olbermann]]'s show so she can clean up his fail (or, more often than not, cheer for him like a [[Twilight]] fangirl). Rachel Maddow is the object of every [[liberal|politico]]'s desire. Anyone who watches her show becomes an instant [[bisexual]] even thought the [[retards|general population]] seems unaffected by her [[gayness|winning charm and good looks.]]

Even though she advocates a [[Fascism|New York view on politics]] and avoids [[penis|confrontation]], she has an obvious haet for [[dinosaur|John McCain]] and derives [[orgasm|great pleasure]] from showing him acting like a [[John McCain|douche]]. A recent study has shown that Maddow's show consists entirely of [[Unfunny|awkward silences following her clunky, robot-like attempts at jokes]] and asinine comments pertaining to Republican politicians that alternate between stating the obvious and flaunting her persecution complex.

Rachel also had a [[Hal Turner|radio show]], in which she discussed the same topics that she does on her TV show, but Air America is in [[Hell|a better place]] now.
