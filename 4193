Jake Roberts
{{An hero}}
[[Image:Jake.jpg|thumb|right|150px|How do I played Wii?]]

'''Jake Roberts''' was a [[13 year old boy|13 year old]] who was reported to have died [[Last Thursday|last Thursday]] after a [[Suicide|tragic accident]] involving him accidentally tying a tie around his neck and to a bunk bed and hanging there accidentally until he was dead. In truth, it was because his father wouldn't let him play [[Wii]] because Jake's sister was watching TV, so he [[emo|offed himself]] when he could have just waited for his sister to finish and [[in the kitchen|gb2 kitchen]].

Someone should have gotten this kid an [[Mitchell_Henderson|iPod]].

Although he died in February, [[b|/b/tards]] and [[Ebaumsworld]] only found out about this on June 26, 2008 and subsequently raided his memorial [[bebo]] page, thus resulting in [[Lulz|epic lulz]]. Better late than never, guize!

As one positive aspect of his [[lulz|tragic]] suicide, he invented Wii hangman.

Jake had bought a Wii game earlier that day, and was planning on playing it, but found his sister watching TV where he wanted to play. So, rather than [[asking for it|slapping the bitch]], he had a [[butthurt|temper tantrum]] and stormed into his room. He was [[Raped|discovered]] hours later by his attentive father, hanging by his neck to the cabin bed by his school tie, becoming [[an Hero]], (or should I say [[Unfunny|an '''Wii'''ro]]? Oh ho ho ho ho!) 

Fortunately, [[Lori Drew|his mother]] clarified the situation by stating that her "[[Asperger's syndrome|sensitive child]] with a [[Drugs|fantastic imagination]]" hadn't meant to die when he hanged himself; [[retard|he just did something stupid.]] Good thing she was around to point this out, as a line of people was already forming outside the door to praise Jake's intelligence. Jake was declared dead two days after he hanged himself, which shows how [[England|Britfags]] can't do anything right.

==But Who Is To Blame?==
When kids kill themselves in [[America]], people usually blame [[Grand Theft Auto|video games]], [[your mom|the parents,]] [[Tom Cruise|movies,]] [[Tom Cruise|cults]] and ''[[Codey Porter|Naruto Sand Ninjas]]''. In [[England]], where things are really, really, really, <b>really</b> fucking boring, they blame the slow and aging hospital soap opera, ''[[Fag|Casualty]]''.

No, [[serious|really]].

Jake's mom said that he had watched an episode of ''Casualty'' together with the family weeks before his suicide, which had featured a young person hanging themselves, but she didn't think anything he had seen influenced him. Well, I guess we all know how [[fail|wrong]] she was.

But a coroner said that Jake had [[Fail|killed himself by accident]] and there was no evidence he has been influenced by the program, because coroners are also licensed mind readers.

The real [[truth]] of the story is that Jake Roberts was deeply into [[autoerotic asphyxiation]]. All the "[[fail|cool]]" kids at school were doing it and Jake really wanted to [[Buttsecks|"fit in"]] with the guys. His friends told him all the [[whores|girls]] would think he was TOTALLY [[hawt]] if he did it. So when he couldn't play with his [[penis|Wii]] he figured the next best thing would be to strangle himself into a [[high]]. Sadly he "[[orly|accidentally]]" killed himself in the process.

Genna-Nadine Smith-X is a [[Attention_whore|girl]] [[retarded|brave]] enough to head into the shit storm going on in Jake's Bebo memorial page. She soon became an [[Internet tough guy]] and proceeded to call out all the raiders on the page. Jake was her friend's uncle's nephew's second cousin or some shit like that, so of course she got all pissy and started arguing with all the people on Jake's comments. All she really succeeded in doing was making herself look like a [[Woman|stupid cunt]]. 

After threatening to kill a few people and then saying she could find their IP addresses because [[lie|her dad has access to the bebo admin]]. This of course was an obvious lie (made funnier from the fact her page says [[idiot|she hates liars]]). When she realized no one cared, she soon [[STFU|fell silent]].

Over the [[Canada|Canadian]] Thanksgiving weekend [[Brandon Crisp]] ran away from home because his parents took away his Xbox 360.  Apparently the mass amounts of ''[[War|Call of Duty 4]]'' was affecting his sleeping and [[basement dweller|social skills]]. His body was found on Oct. 24. [[Some argue]] that Brandon is an hero, but others say not. The debate is under top priority at the official An Hero headquarters in [[gay|Antartica]].

Now this is a story<BR>
All about how my life got ended, roped upside down<BR>
And I'd like to take a minute just hanging right here so,<BR>
I'll tell you how I became the original An Wiiro.<BR>
<BR>
In Scarborough England Born 'n' raised<BR>
On the Wii was where I spent most of my days<BR>
Chilling out, maxing relaxing all cool<BR>
And playing some ''[[Battletoads]]'' when I got in from school<BR>
When there was this time my sis was up to no good<BR>
Wouldn't let me use the TV when she really should<BR>
I got in one temper tantrum and my dad began to frown<BR>
He said "You go up to your room till you've learned to calm down"<BR><BR>

I was extremely upset and wanted to die<BR>
I look all around and I spotted my tie<BR>
I slung it round my neck then I jumped from a high<BR>
And thought "This is gonna teach 'em to confiscate my..."<BR>

My dad came up to my room about 7 or 8<BR>
And he yelled to my mummy "YO BITCH! 999!"<BR>
But it was no use as I'd run out of air<BR>
And since then I've cause a whole lot of despair <BR>
<BR>
