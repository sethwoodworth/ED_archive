WarpMyMind.com is, according to themselves, "dedicated to supplying you with free [[hypnosis]] MP3's" and trying to "maintain a wide variety of files.". This is [[lie|not entirely correct]], as a lot of files either require "Premium Access" or are pay-only, and since all files either deal [[what|with turning you gay or female or submissive or incontinent or furry or all of this at once]]. [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=Comment&fid=2204 THIS IS NOT A JOKE.] 

[http://www.hypno-files.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=Comment&fid=100725 Saner] [http://www.hypno-files.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=Comment&fid=100167 files] are confined to the sister site, hypno-files.com.

[[Image:WMMCategories.JPG|thumb|The file categories.]]

[[Fail|Much as you would expect]], [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=index&FileCategory=0 WarpMyMind.com has a huge collection of files] available for download, created by [[Sick Fuck|its users]]. They are divided into several categories for easy access, like [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=index&FileCategory=6 Diaper/Incontinence], [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=index&FileCategory=7 Humiliation] or [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=index&FileCategory=4 Slavery]. You can also specifically search for hypnosis files that will [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=index&FileType=3 force you to do stupid things whenever somebody says a certain phrase] or those [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=index&FileType=4 which can't be removed by normal means].

Still no jokes.

== Examples ==

[[Image:Popularity.JPG|thumb|[[batshit|Penis shrink is more popular than massive weight gain which is more popular than girls with big tits.]]]]

[[Image:cockshrinkagain.JPG|thumb|Well, who ''doesn't'' want a smaller penis?]]

[[Image:Hypnofurries.JPG|thumb|Dear god, they're everywhere.]]

While the page claims to be encouraging diversity, popular files usually include [[Furry]], [[Diaperfur|Incontinence]], [[Babyfur|Infantilisation]] or [[Furry|exaggeratedly sexual]] themes. The best example for this would be the elusive  [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=Comment&fid=974 CurseDiaperUrinateDefficateChastityHumiliationTortureCCPDribbleCumMore] [[what|file]], which has 11,754 downloads at the time of writing. Still not had enough? Well then:

Does someone come to your house or something?



[http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=Comment&fid=971 '''Name''': Phantom Rapist]

'''Description''':  ''This file is experimental. As all my files do it utilizes subliminals, a binaural, and and induction voice. I have cut this one down to the bare minimal. There are several differences from my normal files. The binaural is in theta in this one, not delta. The subliminals, while different for the right and left channels are now audible. The induction voice is computer generated but the audio echo effect has been decreased to allow greater understanding of the voice. This file is a curse. It creates a phantom rapist that will force the user onto their hands and knees and anally rape them every time they are not in the direct view of another person. The rapist will vanish the instant that the user comes under the view of another person. It is a seamless loop like all my other files. That much hasn't changed. Enjoy!

Enjoy your [[rape]].

'''Description''': ''Whenever the listener wears diapers and is in a safe place they will be unable to control their bladder.

THIRTY-ONE THOUSAND AND FOUR-HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE FUCKING DOWNLOADS.


As a final insult to human decency, there is [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Services&file=index&Cart=AddToCart&ItemNumber=310 this:]

[[Image:DiaperHumiliation88K.JPG|center|frame]]

== WHAT? ==
Yes. This person made [[all caps|EIGHTY-EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS]] by [[diaperfur|forcing people to wear diapers]]. [[what|EIGHTY-EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS for maybe four hours of work]]. That's [[WTF|TWENTY-TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOUR]].

Coming to think of it, [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php that EMG person] seems to be responsible for [[at least 100]][[%]] of the site's files and has probably made a fortune by now, thanks to [[sick fuck|persons]] with too much money.

==Typical Hypnosis Session==
[[Image:Wmmidiot.png|thumb|[[Truth|Undeniable proof]] that EMG is after your [[jew gold]].]]
# Download a file that has effects [[sick fuck|you]] would like to have and put it on your [[iPod]] or any other shitty MP3 player.
# When going to bed, listen to the file for [[at least 100]] minutes.
# Wake up at the end to see if the file has actually done anything.
# If not, keep listening to the same file once a night for four months straight.
# [[????]]
# PROFIT!!! Well not really, you [[sick fuck]].

Yes, seriously, [[LOLWUT|it takes pretty much takes about four months for anyone to get a single file working,]] even if they use different files to support them, maybe less if you're [[retard|'lucky']], more if you're [[retarded]]. So this pretty much means the people who buy premium and paid files are [[Lol|pretty much fucked if they can't even get them going in the first place.]] What a nice scam!

== UPDATE: They get creepier, somehow. ==
Words [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=Comment&fid=2204 really don't do this one justice]. I should probably make a joke about how this at least solves the age old question as to how the furry disease spreads, but no amount of caps and/or goatse could do this justice. Lo, I am smitten.

Also, LAWL FAGS.

(Note: This used to be a premium file. People paid for this.)

== THE REBUTTAL ==
It appears that, some time ago, somebody on their forums [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=5015&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=dramatica&start=0] took a break from fantasizing <s>about his dick shrinking</s> [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=5237 being turned into a catgirl], and noticed this article. Most of the replies in that thread were surprisingly rational. However, there was a true gem of BAWWWWING to be found as well. The best part is all of it.

Mr. Cardigan sure is cool. No, [http://warpmymind.com/modules.php?name=Files&file=Comment&fid=1665 really.]

== Turns out they're ok, actually! ==

[[Image:WellThenItsOK.PNG|center|frame]]

So in summary, getting your brain fucked over with crazy shit like this is like being a good, although non-human clown, only with cum instead of water?

WELL MAKES PERFECT SENSE I SEE NO PROBLEM AT ALL WITH THAT.
