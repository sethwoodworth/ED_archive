In real life, '''Craps''' is a game of chance, often played in back alleys by skid row derelicts, that involves betting on the outcome of dice that are rolled by a [[Virginia Tech Massacre|shooter]].  When played online, the game does not change very much, but there are several variations, most notably on imageboards such as [[7chan]] or [[4chan]].  In those places craps are often played (and confused with the game of roulette) when a [[OP]] posts a “chan roulette” image depicting any of several things.  The subsequent posts in the thread are then compared to the original image (by post number) and the outcome is found.

==History==

Craps has been played since at least 2000 BC, where a variation of the game was played by [[Egypt|Egyptian]] soldiers when they weren’t beating [[Nigra|African slaves]] who were charged with building the [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/a/a0/Pyramid_head_raep_tiem.jpg Pyramids].  Over the ensuing millennia, the game has undergone a multitude of evolving changes culminating in what we now know as online craps, played by netizens everywhere.

Just like all the other online variations of popular gambling games, online craps [[Liar|attempts to present a fair and wholesome face]] while at the same time ripping off as many people as possible in the unswervingly quickest amount of time.

==Online Casino Betting==

Online casinos offer various forms of craps.  The rules of the game are simple, between rolls of the dice, you make bets on the outcome of what the [[Dice|dice]] will read at the end of the roll.  This sounds [[Sarcasm|straightforward enough]] until a player considers that they are rolling dice that in reality amount to computer cheats.  Bets can be placed on any number of dice roll results:

*Pass Line Bet:  A gambler bets on [[Wordfilter|7]] or 11.

*Don’t Pass Line Bet: A gambler bets that the shooter will not get a 7 or 11.

*Pass Odds:  A bet you shouldn’t make because you don’t understand the game.

*Don’t Pass Odds:  See Pass Odds above.

*Come Bet: If a 7 or 11 is rolled on the first roll of the series, this is a bet on whether the shooter will roll a 7 or 11 again.

*Don’t Come Bet: The rubber has a hole in it.  If you pull out, you win.

*Single Roll Bets: Wagers are made on any sort of outcome.  If a Single Roll Bet is made that the player will roll a Boxcars (two sixes) and Boxcars occur on the ensuing roll, the Single Roll Bettor wins.  There are many variations of this bet.

*[[Horny|The Horn]]: A bet that a gambler makes where he tries to guess what will come up next.  Typically, this bet is made on a series of numbers and pays out better than a natural straight bet.

*Hop Bet: A bet on what the dice look like at the end of the roll.

*Whirl: A [[chicken]] bet.  This bet on a single roll is also insured by a side bet in case the original wager is a loser.

*Roll Bets:  These are bets that depend on the outcome of a whole series of rolls.  Players who make these sorts of bets will Roll Bet on anything.  This includes what color the [[16-year-old girl|girl’s]] panties are who is standing over at the slot machines next to the bar…no, not that one, the other one…the girl in the red dress…dark red!  God damnit, right there!

==It’s Not Roulette, Dipshit==
[[Image:Craps9.jpg|thumb|It's <u>CRAPS</u> you fucking moron.]]
Often, when browsing a Chan board, a person will come across a variation of craps that is often mistaken for roulette.  The thread usually begins with an image that depicts several outcomes that depend upon a number.  The number is derived from a post made in the thread by that post’s number.  

For example:

*A picture depicts several women in various stages of undress.

*The number 8 in that picture shows a really [[ugly]] person.

*You post in that thread.

*Your post number ends in the number 8.

*You are theoretically now having sex with that ugly person.

*You post two to four more times in the thread until you achieve the outcome you desire (number 3, the really hot [[16 year old Japanese schoolgirl|azn chick]]).

Channers often mistake this game for roulette, while stating “ROLL” in the thread several times.  Hey, guess what?  You don’t “ROLL” anything in roulette dipshit, you “SPIN” a wheel.  Craps is the game you roll dice in, faggot.
