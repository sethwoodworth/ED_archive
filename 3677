All hail the founding father of all [[13-year-old boys]]. '''Hello My Future Girlfriend''' is one of the first experiments to demonstrate that [[No girls on the internet|there are no girls]] (nope, not even girlfriends) [[No girls on the internet|on the internets]]. Coming right from the [[web 1.0]] to [[cooldude|steal your girlfriend]] with his fancy hair and slightly ''[[Derp]]'d'' eyes, '''Michael Blount''' (aka '''Kidblount''') created the website in '''1998''' [[mitchell Henderson|after losing his girlfriend]]. I mean Fuck! look at his fucking hairstyle, not even motherfucking [[fag|vanilla ice]] could be that cool!! and where do you think the nigger jew of [[kanye west]] took the idea of the glasses? '''THAT'S RIGHT: FROM THIS FUCKER'''. You wish your fat-ass [[you]] were as cool as this gangsta'. Of course, not even a [[cool guy]] like him was ''fail-proof'' and his plan had an irreparable [[Fail|flaw]]: [[No girls on the internet|Obvious truth was obvious]]. Luckily for this stud, he later discovered that he was [[fag|homosexual]]. So maybe the internet can help him find his future boyfriend.

Internet surfers eventually found the page, and [[lol'd]]. Unfortunately, the original page is now lost to history, but archives and parodies still survive until this day.
