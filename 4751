'''Last Measure''' was the extremely popular and indisputably [[funny]] internet cartoon that swept the world circa September [[2005]]. Even though Last Measure received thousands of hits each day during the peak of its popularity, the site was later removed from the [[internets]], in a cruel blow against anyone who did not yet see it.

== History of Last Measure ==

Last Measure was created some time ago by a pair of brothers who did not give their names, but went by the codenames of "[[timecop]]" and "[[user:Jesuitx|Jesuitx]]". They hosted Last Measure on a [[freewebs]] server for about a day before a bored [[nerd]] found it, then [[Slashdotted]] it. Traffic quadruplified, and the brothers were more than happy to upgrade to a real server to allow this many people to see their hilarious video.

[[G4]] and [[Microsoft|MS]][[Old media|NBC]] got hold of Last Measure, and both networks plugged the website at prime time. Again, more people than ever were flocking to see the hilarity of Last Measure.

== Demise of Last Measure ==
On September 30, 2005, [[United States]] Senator [[Rick Santorum]], who is [[unfunny]] and has no sense of [[humor]], said that Last Measure was "a foul degradation of America's [[Moralfag|morals]]"; he then went on to say how [[serious]] the [[internet]] is supposed to be. [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] hence concludes that Senator Santorum is an [[offensive]] [[lulz]]killer.

After Santorum's verbal [[ejaculation]], [[Microsoft]] sued Last Measure, saying they infringed [[copyright]] and were using [[illegal]] [[bandwidth]]. The charges were blatantly [[false]], but the brothers could not afford a [[lawyer]] who could defeat [[Bill Gates]]'s team of robot prosecutors. They had to concede and take down the site.

In 2007 at some point, Last Measure got put into virus scanners. Now instead of people seeing the uplifting and family-friendly site, their [[virus]] scanner comes up and blocks it saying it detects a virus.

== MIRRORS OF LAST MEASURE! ==

Before the site was officially shut down, millions of [[blogger]]s copied the cartoon and hosted it on mirrored servers. Even [[Bill Gates]], with his legions of hackers, couldn't take down all of them. timecop and JesuitX could rest in peace knowing their creation was still alive.

== Last Measure Unified X ==

A version of Last Measure was created by Jmax in an attempt to merge lastmeasure version 3 and 4 and coffeemeasure. Along with the merging came new shit, such as LMX Live stats which tracks the amount of redirects a person gets resulting in a race for [[e-penis]]. Notable additions are the inclusion of more "Hey Everybody!" voice clips from various GNAA members and the addition of PDF ruin.
