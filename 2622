'''Elfwood''' (aka "'''Elfhood'''" and "'''Elfwoody'''") was a website founded May 1, 1996 by a [[fag]]gy Swedish [[pirate]] who wanted to help populate the species of [[otherkin]] on the net. '''Thomas Abrahamsson''', famed [[Moby]] imitator, created it and it is based currently out of Link√∂ping, [[Sweden]] (say that 5 times fast). It is currently the world's largest site for [[Science Fiction]] and [[Fantasy]] Art.

Elfwood is basically a place where a bunch of [[furries]], [[D&D]] nerds and anime freaks post their shitty [[art]] and writings. Pretty much the same thing as [[deviantArt]] except much much worse. The '''''extremely''''' outdated galleries (which exist for the purpose of [[lulz]]), confusing site navigation, broken links, and [[lamerz]] usage of layout templates are all examples of poor website features.

The site also uses a [[retarded]] system of approving the art/writing submissions by having them reviewed ONE PERSON AT A TIME. Thus, a creative submission can take weeks or even months (this is even worse when the mods get breaks for New Year's, [[lulz]]!) to actually appear on your gallery. Further dissatisfaction has been created because of the stupid new rules for submissions (like no drawings on lined paper...etc.). Elfwood has become [[elitist]] and [[shitty]] in the recent years because of its competition with [[#External Links|Epilogue]] and the aging of its [[fat]], [[dork]]y, and [[Emo|unloved]] moderators who have [[Inferiority Complex]]. People do not want to put up with shit they don't have to so many Elfwooders have left for DeviantART; it doesn't give a crap about anyone or anything.

"''Elfwood's mission is to provide a place for amateurs from all over the world to share, teach, and inspire a new generation of dreams.''"[http://elfwood.lysator.liu.se/about.html?8453]

Elfwood has been credited for jump starting names in the Fantasy art realm but the truth is the founder of the site can't even draw.

Elfwood's [[community]] on [[LJ]] came into existence when Elfwood shut itself down because of flamers and harassment posts and offered LJ as an alternative. This introduced a [[shitload]] of [[people]] to LJ and in turn spawned more masses of [[LJ user]]s.

Elfwood is the site of the [[Devil]] and it is advised to avoid it when possible! Seriously, you'll leave feeling like you've been raped.
