Vampires, like [[Dragon|Dragons,]] used to be badass but have been raped [[in the ass]] so many times by furfags and story writes that they are no longer recognizable as the mountains of [[awesome]] that they once were.

In Storytown Village, '''vampires''' are lithe, seductive, [[Prostitute|hypnotic creatures of the night]] who revel in bacchanalian pleasure-seeking and live wild and erotic unlives, who actually used to be [[fail|cool]].  In Reality: clumsy, [[fat]], socially inept, sartorially blinded fuck-ups that are so pathetic even the [[goths]] won't hang out with them anymore, who were never cool.Vampires are [[You|social rejects]] bent on acquiring [[AIDS]] from licking the blood off their 'victims' fingers in an odd, retarded expression of a fetish (which they claim isn't a fetish).

They try their best to mimic their mythological counter-parts; whether by slathering themselves in white make-up, wearing fake-fangs to "feel their Inner Predator" or by actually drinking blood, depending on the level of [[retard|retardedness]] of the individual. Either way, they are a great source of epic [[lulz]] as their general lack of social skills lend them to be rather oblivious and egotistical. 
  
Put simply, vampires are [[emo]] kids who have the [[gay]] gene turned up to 11. Aside from [[furries]] and [[otherkin]], 'vampires' are probably the easiest group of societal ejaculate to troll.

==Why People End Up Pretending==
[[Image:Dracula.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Typical Strigoi buttfucking a [[12_year_old_girls|12-year-old-girl]] ]]

"Real" vampires usually start out as [[complete]] social failures that, having somehow missed all of the usual no-ego support groups like [[Heavy metal|heavy metal fandom]] and comic book reading, end up scrabbling around in the absolute pits of subculture [[hell]] for the first group that will accept them. 

Lacking confidence in themselves and too wrapped up in teenage pseudo-nihilism (which, oddly enough, can last well into their forties)  to seriously consider [[religion]], these [[loser]]s gravitate toward other emotional crutches that can promise them uniqueness and a purpose in life. Basically, these losers are pretending to be vampires, so that they could feel special.(In reality, they are actually retarded jerk-offs.) Vampirism promises these [[Asperger's syndrome|outcasts]] a reason for never quite fitting in by giving them [[Anonymous|unfuckwithable]] [[LOL WUT|occult powers]], so [[No|their bullies from high school will totally regret having treated them like shit]]. And unlike the [[otherkin]], the mythical creatures they're psychotically pretending to be are human-shaped and sexy!

There follows a minimum of five years of flouncing around in ridiculous clothing (bought at Hot Topic), buying stupid pewter accessories and filling their bedrooms with white lace and imitation silver candelabras until one is a vampire. There is an increased risk of taking up [[magic]] during this [[time]]. Many "vampires" change their names to things like "Raven Darkemoon," "Matthius BlackThorne," and "Lord Noctem Aeternus" because vampires are not allowed to be called Sarah and Clive.  ''(<s>Really, who would ever be afraid of the dark vampire Clive?</s>) [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]. No one is afraid of someone named Matthius Blackthorne either.(More like Fagius BackWhored, [[amirite]]?'' )

Typical hobbies include writing crappy [[poetry]] about crimson roses and wolves, listening to dreadful [[music]], hanging around in graveyards, eating chips and crying.

A notion which many of these individuals contract is the belief that they are not really human beings, but instead some higher force.  They use this reasoning to justify their consumption of human blood, thinking of themselves as predators and everyone else as prey.  They tend to view "mundanes" or normal, sane people as merely food or [[nigra|nigras]].  <s>So if you see a vampire coming, get to the back of the bus.</s> Ridicule them as they walk past you on the way to the back of the bus, pelting them with Twinkies as they go write poetry and [[Twilight]] fanfictions, tears welling up in their eyes.

Most "vampires" eventually grow out of it and become standard goths, but the hardcore continue on into their mid-forties. No vampires older than this have ever been seen. Do they truly stop aging? Or do they just kill themselves once they hit their mid-life crisis and see how they've pissed away the one chance at youth they were ever going to get?  Obviously, the latter.

==Terminology==
[[File:Disney vampires.jpg|thumb|right|Silently and discretely, nosferatu and his attractive friend walk among us mortals.]]
<span class="co;[The Moar You Know ...];[Abandon Hope Ye Who Enter Here];0;terms"></span>
<span class="terms">

*'''Awakening''' occurs when feeling particularly [[butthurt]] after [[shit nobody cares about|not getting a date for the prom, or maybe having your ass handed to you by the football team]] and deciding to put on your sister's makeup and [[Furry|hiss]] at strangers.
*'''[[House]]''' is a show on Fox.  Also another word for an individual cult. 
*'''Vampire Hunter''' is every basement dweller's worst fear: someone who hunts real vampyres!!1!11  They will usually work themselves into a paranoid frenzy over speculation of whether hunters actually exist.
*'''Posers''' and '''Losers''' is an all encompassing terms for the vampire community.
*'''Vampire''', a [[douche]]
*'''Vampyre''', pretentious [[douche]]
*'''Whampyyre''', a [[cunt]]
*'''Donor''' or '''Black Swan''' is someone who the vampire stalks, rapes and steals blood from.
*'''Blood''' [[meth]], [[crack]], [[cocaine]], etc
*'''Prana''', '''Chi''', '''Energy''', '''Cum''', Your life force which they suck out to make you one of them.
*'''[[Mundane]]''', a sane person
*'''Cattle''' or '''Food''', The cock that they crave.
*'''Sire''' is one who has [[Buttsex|converted]] someone to vampirism, because using twelfth-century terminology and spelling makes everything real. (See also: [[Magick]])
*'''Strigoi''' is the typical [[English|Romanian]] [[Trying too hard|middle-aged faggoth]] who pretends to be a vampire to get laid by [[Dying alone|high-school rejects]]. All these douches have to do is google up a couple of phrases in Romanian, put on a black trench coat and they're set. Vlad Strigoii is the name of a song by Ostrogoth, the most homoerotic gothic band out there, and a bunch of [[Lie|authentic]] [[imaginary|vampires]] out there have adopted the alias, thinking it to be the REAL name of the REAL Dracula. Strigoii (noun 'Strigoi' with definitive article 'i', both forms can be used in singular and in plural) is supposed to be the conglomerate of all Romanian vampires and their descendants. Whilst <strike>real</strike> sane Romanians don't give a shit about Strigoi, view them as the equivalent of ghosts, not vampires, [[insane|angsty American faggoths]] masturbate daily to the idea of feeding them.
*'''Vampire Council''' is the goth equivalents of David Koresh, but with herpes. Meetings are held at Denny's at 2 in the morning while drinking "only coffee, black" and making long angry stares at the wait staff.
*'''Vampire Elder''' is one who has reached the age of thirty-seven and still not grown out of it. Said people are never, ever employed and try to convince their impressionable fifteen-year-old "initiates" that sex with them would create a higher spiritual bond and [[scientology|advance their dark powers]].
*'''OVC''' Online Vampire Community
*'''Menstrual fluid''', Delicious.

==Types==
[[Image:Fauxpire.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Don Henrie]]; doing it wrong since [[last Thursday|last Thursday]]]]

Regardless of type, [[batshit insane|vampires]] generally tend to regard themselves as above "[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Tvd-mleep.jpg normal humans]".  Keep this in mind when dealing with them, as they think that you are merely a mortal monkey and that they are your god.

*'''Sanguine vampires''' drink blood and call themselves "Sanguine" because it sounds [[French]] and therefore is more likely to attract [[Anne Rice|Lestat]], [[Lie|WHO IS A REAL PERSON AND NOT EVEN SLIGHTLY FICTIONAL]]. (Sanguine really means "cheerfully optimistic, hopeful, or confident".)

*'''Psychic vampires''' are too wussy to actually drink blood, they insist that they're still vampires because they suck the souls out of people. This has the advantage of allowing them to participate in a fuck-up culture without the associated risks of [[AIDS|infection]], or doing something really gross.  Also allows them to dodge unpleasant questions like ''So how come I can still see your reflection in a mirror?'' or ''We're driving over a bridge.  I thought you vampires couldn't cross running water?'' The claim that they drain the psychic energy of anyone around them by some mystic process is also a convenient way to explain to themselves why they are [[lonely|rejected socially]], rather than accepting that their social skills need work and putting in the effort to change for the better, like [[Tom Cruise|a pinnacle of society]]!!

*'''Aura vampires''' are like psychic vampires but even more full of [[bullshit]].
*'''Arithmomania vampires''' [[Sesame Street|Vampires who Obsessive-compulsively count things]].
*'''Dio Brando''', the only cool vampire. Also see [[Za Warudo]] and [[WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY]]
*'''[[Castlevania|Dracula]], [[What is a man?]] A miserable little pile of secrets!
*'''Twihard''', [[Twilight|Either batshit insane fangirls or guys who wanted to have sex with said fangirls]]

==New World Order==
[http://www.veritasvosliberabit.com/images/VVCPublicMeeting12.06.08.pdf The Leaders] of this community are generally self-proclaimed and are usually the most out-there and [[sick fuck|sick people]] in the [[cult|community]].  It's [[you|sick fuck]]s leading the [[dumb|blind]].

[[Last Thursday]], some discussions held on VampireRave between mighty bludz-sucking Elders of "the community" surfaced. [[lulz]] were had:

{{frame|<small>{{morphquote|mqtest|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;

|"Ave, Greetings my [[Incest|brothers and sisters]].
I have been speaking with Stephen Omallie, Rev. Vicutus, Sir Shaolin Macphee and Maven Lore. We have been reaching out to other members of the [[harem|community]].
About how we as a [[Family|community]] can come up with a [[Law|code of conduct]] we can all [[fap|agree upon]], and ways to [[murder|enforce them]], so we need your thoughts on it.
We have been discussing making a of list of legitimate [[religion|house holds]] and [[cult|covens]], and guidelines for each [[cult|house]] hold to uphold to get on the list and to remain on the list.
Now [[liberal|hear us out]], we are trying to find a way to better our [[harem|community]] and protect it from those whom would do it [[Secks|harm]].
We have all seen at some point or another were some [[Redneck|yahoo]] who plays the [[vampire|masquerade]] who [[vampire|takes it too far]] and [[Michelle_Belanger|end up on the news making us look bad]].
We all have a council or something like it in our states and each one has a Keeper of the Veil ( Sheriff )
what is the point in having one and [[House_Kheperu|Mradu]] if they don’t do anything?
I know this works because here in my Halo Septem Civis ( VA ) we enforce the laws we live by and have been doing so for over a year now.
We are looking for way to better our community and keep it safe, we would love to hear your thoughts on what we are trying to do.

Ryu Noctem Aeternus.
Childe of Lord Father Vincent Orion and Mother Lady Saige Orion of the original Clan Sabreooth.
Founder of the House of Noctem Aeternus, Keeper of the Veil and Co-Founder of the court of the Order of the Vampyre and the Halo of Septem Civis."|

|<b>This was met by much enthusiasm by the vampyre crowd:</b>
<br>
I like the idea. It would be nice to know when crossing or settling in another's halo or territory. Perhaps include a short [[Rape|"rundown" on customs and traditions for each halo]] so as to allow for diplomacy-host or gratitude gifts or even just a short introduction visit so on some level our faces are familiar to one another. I have noticed little things can become a big problem of misunderstandings.

I am not so sure the "lists" should be made "public" though. I think they should be inner circle stuff and a need to know thing perhaps. Seekers will ask and they can be pointed to a person who acts as an ombudsman does during military deployments. Sort of a PR guy.

I am sure all houses have their own [[Whore|customs]] or [[sex|traditions]] to show respect and gratitude in a formal manner. It would be embarrassing to take wine to a house that does not imbibe, smoked salmon to a house that is [[vegetarian]], and the same for presenting flowers at a home where [[retard|an asthmatic]] resides etc. It would get things off on a wrong foot.|

|As apposed to everyone having their own codes. Id rather live in in big society who is like minded instead of a million little societies where each individual believes in their own vampiric laws. [[Sheep|In order for communities to thrive, there must be a system to follow. Otherwise why do we call it a community]]?

Also, nothing was said about [[Todd_Hoyt|Leading]], or following any one [[Sanguinarius|leaders]] [[Michelle_Belanger|reign over an entire community]]. There is no destination any one person is trying to lead any followers to. Only some sort of system that can be seen as a vampiric community code of conduct only. Not something that the entire world and every living being within it could follow if they so chose. '''The Vampiric Community is not the Human community''', some are looking for something to separate the two. I'm not trying to turn this into a race battle, but if I can have my life with certain things I look at as something I can follow separate from the man/woman next to me and be just fine, Why cant the Vampiric Community have something that allows us to have a community separate from the mundane? Something that can be call our own. Again, yes, this is what the Black Veil was for, but it doesn't distinguish who its meant to be followed by. Someone in a Communist community wont try to live a life of an American in their own community because they don't have the same guidelines. (leaving what would happen to them if they did, off to the side) Therefore some have purposed the idea of creating '''something that only the true vampyre is able to follow, something that is impossible for one that is not a true vamp to follow.|}}</small>|color=red}}

... Has no one told these freaks that TrueBlood isn't real?

==Law==
[[Image:Sangi_cannibals.jpg|thumb|Normal sanguinarian conversation.]]

Many vampires have learned to keep their mouth shut about their psychosis, especially if they have children.  Fortunately, there are some who just [http://www.squidoo.com/CPSdestroyedmyfamily don't], and they are exposed for the disease riddled psychopaths that they are.  

Having your brood taken away is a commonplace thing for people in the vampire community.  The likeliness is increased with every post made to a web forum, every book published and every National Geographic special one appears in.

===Crimes===
While most of the [[sick fucks]] like to claim that Vampirism is a non-violent subculture, one has to question how non-violent people really are when they claim to desire slashing people open and drinking from their wounds. 

Here are some notable crimes caused by people claiming vampirism and/or affiliation with the subculture:
*[[Jonathon the Impaler|Johnathon Sharkey]] is in jail for [http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=9122944&nav=menu374_1 threatening] Dubya.

*[http://www.religionnewsblog.com/21162/lisa-ptaschinski Vampire lesbians?] For added lulz, writer is [[batshit insane]] too and says women who ''kill people and drink their  blood'' merely "break the mould of expected female behaviour".  No, ''really.''

==Invading the Mainstream==
[[Image:Mtv_vampires.jpg|thumb|Google cache nevar forgets.]]

Whether by [[Liart66|appearences on Tyra Banks]] or through interviews with [http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Story?id=6154446&page=1 ABC News] and [http://mobile.washingtonpost.com/detail.jsp?key=319732&rc=st_al The Washington Post], vampires are trying to get a foot hold in modern culture.  Since by vampire I really mean [[schizophrenic]] [[16 year old girl]]s, this will likely lead to lulz and internet drama instead of blood sucking and hot vampire sex.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcHYymAQZsw Don Henrie has declaired himself the leader of forcing the vampire subculture into the mainstream].  He has appeared on many daytime talkshows to be ridiculed by their hosts and many documentaries that air on halloween to reinforce the stereotype that [[truth|people who drink blood are escaped mental patients with poor wardrobe choices]].

He is also claiming to be spearheading a poorly thought out reality tv show for MTV based on the [[vampire]] [[cult|community]].

An episode of [[South Park]] that aired on November 19th totally [[rape]]d the vampire community in the ass by stating the truth that all self-proclaimed vampires are just moronic wannabe [[goth]]s who need to grow the hell up.  Some "vampires" are trying to laugh it off.  Douchebags like [[Michelle Belanger]] [http://sethanikeem.livejournal.com/222654.html didn't understand] that the show creators were being serious when the characters said that people who pretend to be vampires are retarded.  Some are trying to find an alternative explanation to the episode, trying to prove that the show creators are really on their side or are somehow awestruck by vampires.

==A Question that has Plagued Vampirekind for Centuries==
[[What is a man?]]

==Community==
[[Image:VampireFleshlight.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Fleshlight|It's not just blood they suck.]]]]

The vampire community is a group of [[idiot|like minded]] individuals who believe that they are [[vampires]].  I bet you didn't see that one [[cum|coming]].  

It is theorized that they have been in existence for [[at least 100|at least 100 years]] and started as an off-shoot of the [[goth|Goth]] subculture.  While the vampire community originally focused on simply making themselves look like romantic representations of [[cp|child-eating]] [[zombie|zombies]], things quickly shifted and got taken to a level of [[lulz]] that is typical of alienated [[16 year old girl|teens]] and [[basement dweller|occult practitioners]].

The community is considered [[lie|"secret"]] by its members that haven't seen [[CSI]], watched National Geographic or The Discovery Channel at Halloween or heard of [[Michelle Belanger]] and [[Don Henrie]].

===Psi-vamps: Serious fucking business===

{{squote|1=As you may know, there are several Vampire Games running on forums. Many of these games are just good fun. People get to act out playing a creature of the night, and good times are had by all. Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that some of these games are a bit more than they seem. It turns out that some of the Game Masters are real psi-vamps. All a 'psi-'vamp' is, is someone that can manipulate emotional surges in people. Similar to Empaths, they get the energy 'high' when they bring someone's emotions to an extreme. But psi-vamps then drain their victim of their emotional energy. ... And to be fair, it’s very likely that most of these psi-vamps don’t even realize that they are psi-vamps. ... But we have observed that there are a few of these GMs that know they are psi-vamps. They are deliberately feeding upon their players. They invite them into ‘families’ for the sole purpose of harming them. They build up their player’s emotions to great extremes, just to feed on them. Leaving these players tired and weak afterward.|2=[http://www.houseofancients.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=77] Psi-vamps: [[Serious fucking business]]}}

==Medical Testing==
[[Image:Prozac photo.jpg|thumb|left|120px|The cure for vampirism.]]

Though doctors and medical professionals are aware of these haematophiliacs and self-proclaimed [[Michelle Belanger|psychic vampires]], few studies have been conducted on the subject. This has resulted in the phenomena being brushed aside and being dubbed ludicrous.  

This is because those supposedly afflicted with this [[faggotry]] know that they are [[batshit insane]].  They know that there is no doctor worth their degree that won't see past their [[bullshit]], so of course they don't submit themselves for analysis.  Most claim that their reasons are because of concern for their privacy, but this is obviously a [[lie]] as most of the people claiming to be approached are making their lively-hood off of duping people by regaling them with fanciful stories about their condition.

Those that have submitted to physical testing, such as [[Don Henrie]], have only proven to the world that the culture and individuals involved are fake and only playing a part to cope with the desolate waste land that is their lives.
Also on an unlulzy note, vampires are technically real. There is a disease called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyria Porphyria] where the symptoms are pale skin, receding gum line, overstimulation of hair follicles (werewolves), and a need for regular blood transfusions due to the disease affecting red blood cells. The whole garlic thing is that chemicals in garlic make the symptoms worse. 
<center><youtube>mrmiTsboUe8</youtube></center>

===The Psychiatric Phenomena===
Psychologists are becoming more and more aware of vampirism (also dubbed "Renfield's Syndrome"[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/vampires/7.html][http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&uid=6823646&cmd=showdetailview&indexed=google]) thanks in part to the [[gay|flamboyant]] and [[usi|self-righteous]] display these people make of themselves. 

If Renfield's syndrome is mentioned in their presence, most vampires like to counter-troll by insisting that since it isn't in the [http://www.dsmivtr.org/ Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders], it is not a real condition, thus [[lie|they aren't crazy]].  In the same breath they will tell you that they refuse to admit their behavior to any medical professional because they know they will be locked up.  They will turn that around into them being persecuted by the hyoomans.  

The above is, of course, all just [[lie|public relations.]]  Among their own kind, most vampires will freely admit to having more mental illnesses than [[Twilight]] has retarded [[16 year old girl|fangirls]].
