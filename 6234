Is considered a <strike>sport</strike> ritual to all [[redneck|rednecks]]. This sport consists of buying an expensive paintball gun (which phails at being a real gun), buying an expensive box of paintballs, shoving them all up your rectum [[goatse]] style, and repeating. Some people get really good, thats when they became the best [[an hero]] of them all, the people who drown themselves from eating [[over 9000]] paintballs.

Typical idiots fucking with their friend instead of actually playing.

This sport can be played by [[white trash|pros]] and [[noobs]]. Both will usually do just as good unless they have a gun that shoots [[at least 100]] [[shit|bps]]. If you play paintball, you are most likely a [[13 year old boy|13 year old boy]] who needs to hold a real gun.

At a point, people believed this to be [[Scientology]], however, due to [[lie|new findings]], we now know this is actually paintball compaines such as SmartParts, and Dye. Dye makes a gun now called the <strike>Dm5</strike> <strike>Dm6</strike> <strike>Dm7</strike> <strike>Dm8</strike> <strike>Dm9</strike> [[Over 9000|Dm9000]] which only costs 1300 USD or your soul.
