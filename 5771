'''Quest for Bush: Night of Bush Capturing''' is an extremely fun video game that was released by [[Al Qaeda|al-Qaida]]<sup>TM</sup> in 2006. 

Players are prompted to advance through six missions against soldiers who look like [[George W. Bush]], followed by a seventh mission against a character who looks like Bush that takes place in a desert-like region. During the game, cool jihadist songs are played in the background. 

==Origins==

This game was modeled on two games released by the [[Americunts|US]] [[torture|Military]]. "Quest for al-Qaida," and "Quest for [[Saddam]]." Quest for Bush is way more fun than the others, which were produced for the military by [[Fox News]].

'''A taste of the action'''

==How it is played==

In the first mission, the player is in an American military camp, where pictures of Bush, (former) U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and Iraqi [[Shit|Shiite]] cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani are plastered on the walls.

The player starts out armed solely with an assault rifle. During the game, the player's goal is to obtain a shotgun, a grenade launcher and a machine gun before advancing to a final fight against a character that looks like Bush. Victory is achieved once all the enemies have been vanquished.
