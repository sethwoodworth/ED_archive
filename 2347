Done with ED
{{finalsolutions}}

[[Image:Exit-Sign.jpg|center|]]

Why would anyone want to leave [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]? Sometimes those who leave may have recently come to a "[[Just as planned|shocking]]" [[Truth|realization]] that every edit they make is frightfully [[unfunny]]. Others find themselves trapped by those [[BAW|nasty]] rules that [[ED]] has in order to maintain [[lulz]]. Some are even [[B&|forcefully booted]] out. 

[[Faggot|"Don't hold us down, man! We just wanna be creative!"]].

==An Example==
[[Image:Leave ed.jpg|frame|[[Chatzilla]] is perfect for [[GTFO]]]]
Sanitario666: I got discouraged from that ED place when I saw they were just another place with a lot of gay rules.<Br>
Jhoh Cable: Exactly. :(<br>
Jhoh Cable: Hey.   <br>
Jhoh Cable: Fuck them faggots.<br>
Jhoh Cable: You can't come at me with rules this and rules that, I can't be tied down. 8)<br>
Jhoh Cable: I AM TOO MUCH OF A [[faggot|FREE SPIRIT]]<br>
Sanitario666: They secretly yearn to be LJ mods.<br>
Jhoh Cable: They probably are. :(<br>
Sanitario666: WELL THAT'S EVEN WORSE<br>
Sanitario666: Worse than wanting to mod an LJ community is ACTUALLY BEING a mod.<br>
Jhoh Cable: Yeah.<br>
Jhoh Cable: They're probably from SA too.<br>
Jhoh Cable: That or journals.<br>
Jhoh Cable: So they're all from places where they simply don't know what it's like to not be moderated.<br>
Jhoh Cable: [[Lie|Clearly their entire site should be run by people like us from clapstro]], where there is no moderation.<br>
Jhoh Cable: But I guess we should not judge people just for being from different cultures (the middle east).<br>
Jhoh Cable: We shouldn't............. but we're going to anyway. 8)<br>
Sanitario666: It's also not what I expected (hoped?!) it would be.  Every article is just a bunch of nonsense.<br>
Jhoh Cable: And repeated injokes. :(<br>
Sanitario666: [[Fact|"Jhoh Cable was born in 1834 and he loves cookies baked in newborn baby tears."]]<br>
Sanitario666: LOL<br>
Sanitario666: Or [[LULZ]], which is funniers, supposedly.<br>
Jhoh Cable: Plus there are no actual anecdotes of precious DRAMA.<br>
Jhoh Cable: So it's like, where's the actual part with the journal drama?<br>
Jhoh Cable: It's just a bunch of shit people made up.<br>
Jhoh Cable: Garth Brooks - Friends In Low Places.mp3<br>
Jhoh Cable: Here is our theme song for deciding to be done with ED.

== I wish I knew how to quit you, a former ED user finds [[User:Weev|Christ]]==
I have to clean my life a lot sooner than I expected. Don't ever ask me to draw vore. I refuse it. I may delete what I have done, and I so far have gone 25 hours without it. I feel a little closer to God. I've also decided to give up Mugen, and encyclopediadramatica. I may have to give up furries. Now the rest of the way back to His side is a long hard journey, but I will traverse this narrow road. Friends will forsake me, new enemies will arise, old ones will resurface. But, this is what must happen. The longer I go with no vore, the longer I can fight off my temptations and gay desires. Who's to say I don't hit a snag and fall back downhill? Doesn't matter, I still have Jesus, and He will always be there to pick me back up and send me on the right path again. 

John, I will always love you, and even though I'm fighting to go back to God's side, I will always have a deep love for you. I'll stop lusting after you, but my love will remain, and will do anything to help you in life. Even if it hurts me. I'd gleefully jump in front of a bus to save you.
