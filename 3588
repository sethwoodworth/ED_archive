{{Spoiler|EPISODE 3 NEVER CAME INTO PRODUCTION AND WILL NEVER BE RELEASED}}
'''''Half-Life 2: [[Electric Boogaloo]]''''' is an overrated [[FPS|first-person shooter]] developed by Valve Corporation, that won over 40 Game of the Year awards. It is mostly used as a platform for socially-stunted [[virgin|gamer]]s to play ''[[Counter-Strike]]''. 

The game is based on the adventures of a cardboard cut-out named [[Gordon Freeman]]. After the events of the first game, Gordon Freeman was kidnapped, teleported [[last tuesday|thousands of years back in time]] and raped in [[oblivion]] for [[at least 100]] years by G-man, and then somehow ended up on a train heading for City 17. City 17 and the entire world are controlled Dr.Br33n, a local pedophile and [[cockmongler|war-monger]]. He spends his days blabbing about shit on giant screens, eating the flesh of his enemies, and rounding up all the kids in the world to his secret lair (ergo there are no children in the game). Gordon then gets kidnapped by an alcoholic and is [[Do it faggot|subjected]] into revolting against the [[hitler|relatively peaceful regime]]. He goes on an adventure for 2 days, meeting Morgan Freeman and his half-black daughter, psychotic fundamentalists, English buccaneers, and eventually goes back to City 17 and pwns Br33n's sorry ass. Unfortunately, G-man (who had been stalking Gordon for the entire game) [[rape|captures]] him again and the game ends. Wow, that shit is so profound.

Here's the progression of the game: you start off with an actually pretty neat walk through Shitty 17, and then a little while later you're in a sewer for over an hour. Then you have to ride a hovercraft and you're like "Wow, coolness! Thank Jesus fucking Mary Magdalene on a bed made out of win I'm out of those fucking sewers!" And it almost immediately gets old, then you proceed to ride the hovercraft around for a [[at least 100|million]] fucking years. Repeat formula for the rest of the game: 10 minutes of cool shit followed by 3 hours of boring shit until the typically anticlimactic shit ending.

''Half-Life 2'' pioneered new, groundbreaking storytelling technique. Rather than making you sit around doing jack shit during overlong, shitty cutscenes, the game lets you walk around during overlong, shitty cutscenes.

== Episode One ==

Valve realized they had just made [[faggots|gamers]] play 10 hours of a game with an alleged story without actually providing any story whatsoever, so they start trying here, and in exchange this one is consumed with running around in variably boring-ass dark places as your bitch follows you around and says "Wow! Look at that [[shit nobody cares about|thing]]!" every two minutes. The game delivers a half-assed ending and left fans/[[noobs]] waiting on the second episode, which we all know is shit.

== Episode Two ==

The creators of ''Half-Life'' figured that if they were able split the sequel into 3 pieces, they could sell your soul to [[Satan]]. Unfortunately, this did not work, and they ended up selling their own souls at 5% interest. Oh well.

== Episode Three ==
The fabled Episode 3 has been demanded by [[virgin|fanbois]] since the dawn of time. However it is clear that the more requests [[fag|Gabe Newell]] gets the more he decides to delay Episode 3 and release shitty games like [[Left4Dead]], [[Left 4 Dead|Left4Dead 2]], [[Portal|Portal 2]] and other [[shit nobody cares about]]. Some suspect that Gabe slipped in the Valve HQ and caused an earthquake just when episode 3 was about to be released. This caused 
unrepairable damage to all episode 3 copies and they had to start over again.

A theory created by [[Facepunch]] member Master117 explained that the reason Half-Life 2 Episode 3 is taking so long is due to a time dilation effect due to how massive [[Gabe Newell]] is. Following the creation, the theory was shamelessly ripped from it's roots and posted on [[4chan]] by some faggot, which was then posted on [[reddit]] by some other faggot.


== Steam ==

The game is run by [[Steam]], which means that most people will bash their monitors in the first 5 minutes of download (if they don't tear their arms off first). The Steam client won't let you play any game- even games with absolutely no online capabilities- unless you have an [[Internet]] connection. They try to trick you into buying your games again by claiming that your games are pre-loads and your account is faulty. This works on the typical Steam user. Steam(ing pile of shit) means that its not up to hydrogen yet. Damn six years of work. This is also the future of DRM (digital rights management)...fucking buggier than an entire swarm of dickants.

Typically for most trailer park dwelling fucktards, the idea of "ending a process" and restarting the client is far too advanced for them. Better take that CS III class.

== The Great Macfuck ==

After [[Steam]] was recently ported to the Apple Mac, [[Valve]] decided to release its [[shit|flagship]] title aswell. [[Shit nobody cares about|Normally nobody would give a shit]] but the morning after PC fags woke up to find their bandwith was being [[rape|raped]] in the ass. All this was a result of Half Life 2 recieving a massive patch to help Macfags resolve their [[faggotry|"problems"]]. 

The [[fail|patch]] had to finish to play Half Life 2 again and Steam steals [[OVER 9000|OVER 9000%]] of your bandwidth for the downloads.
So PCfags were severely [[butthurt]], however [[Valve]] continued to [[troll]] them by announcing [[Team Fortress 2]] was coming out for Mac along with all its useless [[fail|patches]].

So all this [[butthurt]] happened only to deliver [[fail|patches]] to PC gamers [[epic fail|which only fixed Mac versions]].
