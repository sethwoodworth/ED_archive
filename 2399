A look at the positively gruesome EDiots. 

{{frame|Today we are going to look at the terrifying EDiots.    

Description:
EDiots are a subspecies of undead -  they are sort of like zombies only stupider and uglier and they're also kind of like deadites.

Appearance:

They are grey,  ugly and zombie-like in appearance and yes they are undead.   They are quite scary and disgusting to look at.

Behaviour traits:

This is nothing admirable about the behaviour traits of the EDiots,  these are the only beings alive that actually LIKE Encyclopedia Dramatica,   they often walk around in a zombie-like stance with their arms outstretched moaning...."LUUULZ!"  in a similar way to how the zombies from Return Of The Living Dead moan "BRAAAAIINS!" ,  they're also incredibly dimwitted.      On occassion they also moan "JOIIIIIIIN US!"  like the deadites as well as sometimes spurting out...."I'LL SWALLOW YOUR SOUL!".

Habitat:
Unlike most zombies and undead beings,  EDiots prefer to lurk around on the site Encyclopedia Dramatica as they are the only creatures that actually LIKE that site.   The site itself has a virus which can infect people on Deviantart and turn them INTO EDiots too.

Powers:

They have no special powers except for posession and brute strength,  they're also incredibly slow and dimwitted.    

Their origin:

They were originally mortal web surfers who got possessed after visiting the site Encyclopedia Dramatica which is where the virus that can infect people on DA originated form.

Caution:

When dealing with this creatures you have to be well prepared.   If one of these creatures touches you,  you'll become a possessed dimwitted EDiot just like them.  It is advised to hide out at the local S-Mart or seek help from the handsome lantern jawed gentleman who runs the housewares department (look for a nametag on his shirt that either says Ash or Bruce). }}
