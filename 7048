Former gay-lover of Fred Gallagher whom he broke up with in mid-2002. Co-wrote the [[wapanese]] webcomic [[Megatokyo]] until it [[jumped the shark]]. Up until 2001, [[MegaTokyo]] was mildly funny (but only to [[13 year old boy]]s who think [[Leetspeak]] is cool) however, Fred had some "creative differences" with Rodney which led to the break up.  

Rodney had wanted the strip to stay as a perfectly normal comic format and story, but Fred insisted on [[fag|fagging]] it up by making the strip go on 300 strip shonen-like storylines, throwing in a bunch of unnecessary [[angst]], random [[japanese]] culture references that [[noone]] gives a shit about, and more [[pedophilia]].

This division is now known on the internets as the "Great Suck", as it was responsible for transforming a mildly funny, if unoriginal [[webcomic]] into military grade [[weeaboo]] [[pedophilia]].

Rodney is guilty of numerous crimes such as internet [[trolling]], malicious neglect leading to widescale weeabooism, promoting [[Leetspeak]], and for trying bring back the pompadour, [[srsly]]? WTF?!?!

Rodney has since retired from comics having been traumatized by the "Great Suck".  He hasn't done much afterwards apart from crying alone at night, drinking heavily, and seeking revenge. Some say became an [[anon]] and stopped being a productive member of society, others suggest he found inner peace and now drifts from town to town, in order to hunt wild [[weeaboo]] for their pelts.

Recently he has returned to working on his master plan to ensure that all of humanity will waste their lives online as he did with his. To this end he now works for [[Second Life|Linden Labs]]. 

Rumor has it owns a [[weeaboo]] like sim where he and several other [[trolling]] [[butthurt]] [[furfag]]s run around and be [[anon]] [[Yaoi]] addicts complaining that people are mocking them and revealing their true identity. The link between him and his actual SL identity is quite unfortunately clear, as when you look around for him he's looked like he's been attacked by [[emo]] [[scene]] girls]] and [[weeaboo]]  [[pedophilia]] addicts.

His lack of personality gets him even more [[butthurt]] when he can't even phrase a single sentence without making your head spin.
