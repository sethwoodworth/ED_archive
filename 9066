'''Wikiporno''' is a [[wiki]] with the aim of being the ultimate directory of [[porn]]. It has stuff in every category, from [[hawt]]ness to [[faggotry]]. As the era of Porn 2.0 dawns upon us, with sites like [[YouPorn]] and their [[DMCA]]-violating [[user-generated content]], some [[asspie]]s thought it necessary to document all of this. They have info on porn sites, porn stars, porn companies, porn videos, pretty much porn everything.

As with [[Wikitravel]], Wikiporno asks its contributors to [http://www.wikiporno.org/wiki/Plunge_forward plunge forward], their way of saying "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BOLD be bold]". This is because like all wikis, the people who founded the site want the contributors to do the hard work so that they can [[profit]].

==The Mission of Wikiporno==
{{quote|Wikiporno is a project to create a free, complete, up-to-date, and [[impossible|reliable]] world-wide guide to pornography.}}

Wikiporno [[article]]s should be useful for at least the following purposes:

*For '''finding [[original content|good content]]''', [[fapping|late-night while surfing the web]];
*For '''finding [[lie|honest]] reviews''', not some hyped up [[advertising]] link gallery;
*For '''locating free porn''' for those who prefer to remain [[anonymous|discrete]];
*For '''individual site / performer / movie information''', no [[Wikipedia|boring general info]];

However, this seems to be a [[failure]] because the categories listed down the site, such as [[black]] and [[hand job]], are hideously incomplete, with only a few articles in each category, [[lawl]]. Despite this, they have many, many articles on the site itself. It's difficult to navigate, and the gay [[mafia]] seems to have taken over the site because about half of all the articles on there are about faggotry.  There's also a how-to article on pimping.  SRSLY.

*[http://www.wikiporno.org/ Wikiporno]. Note that it doesn't have a "you must be 18 to enter" notice. This means that it is technically violating international laws, in the same sense that [[Wikipedia Porn|Wikipedia]] is.
