== THE LOCKLEGION IS A STALE COPYPASTA OF THE CLOCKCREW ==

If you thought the [[Clock Crew]] was bad, then you should examine their "retarded little brother."  The '''[http://www.locklegion.org Lock Legion]''' was made back [[last thursday]] by [[retard|StrawberryLock]], a guy who thought he could initiate [[lulz]] by copying what [[retard|StrawberryClock]] did with B.  He made N and submitted it to the [[Newgrounds]] portal.  His submission was blammed.  This caused him to cry all night to his [[gay|butt buddy]], [[retard|BananaLock]].  [[retard|BananaLock]] shared the rejection along with [[retard|Strawberry]] and made the Lock Legion.  [[retard|Genius]].

==Flash Community?==

[[Image:idiotpost.jpg|thumb|A typical post on the Lock Legion.  This is mainly a contribution to the ego boost these [[13-year-old boy|13 year old boys]] get.]]

Although the Lock Legion is said to be a Flash Community, it is undeniable that it is a forum community.  Whenever they're told to do Flash, they cry like little [[faggots]] to their leaders not to do so, their leaders whine back at them, and nothing gets done.  The cycle continues until they are destroyed by their own stupidity and laziness.  A good example of this is a user named [[retard|ComicLock/Shenorai/Lucent/JohnLocke]], a [[lulzcow]] who has not once contributed Flash within his entire life, yet still lurks on the Lock Legion Forums and continues his [[fag|faggotry]] despite an [[MP3|audio clip]] existing of him [[emo|crying]] on [[skype]].
