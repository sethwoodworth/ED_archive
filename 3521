Loosely based off of the ''[[Guitar Hero|Guitar Hero]]'' controller, the '''guitar''' is, according to any [[13 year old boy|teenager]], the only musical instrument in the world. Everyone plays guitar. Everyone started playing guitar to get laid. ''Everyone''. And out of all the people who own guitars 10% of them actually know how to play it, and only 3% of that 10% know how to play it well. If you're not part of that 3% who utilize the humble guitar to gain the [[hookers and blow|finer things]] in life, then the page will teach you everything you need to know. The only thing that can kill a guitar is the recorder.

*'''Guitar''' (AKA most overrated and overplayed instrument in history)<br>
Many states require that individuals learning to play the guitar must learn the main riffs to either "Sweet Home Alabama," "Sweet Child of Mine," ''Stairway to Heaven'' or ''Smells like Teen Spirit'', and play these and nothing else at every opportunity. If you're unsure of what the law is in your area, many music police will allow you the minimum knowledge of "Smoke on the Water" by Deep Purple. If you suck so bad that you can't play that, even Jawsus and Michael Jackson wouldn't suck that tiny cock of yours.

Guitars can come in many forms, all of which fall into the categories of acoustic or electric. Acoustic guitars are used by [[mexican|mexicans]] and [[communist|hippies]] to create "folk music", which always consist of only the basic open chords, because these niggers never learn anything past the 3'rd fret. They are occasionally seen in the hands of [[redneck|rednecks]] singing songs about niggers bitchin' and the need to beat [[Your Mom|women]]. Folk music occurs when a guitarist becomes the vagina that he originally set out to penetrate.  Sadly enough, this loser will nail more women than ten black rapists, except with the girl's [[fail|consent]]. Just look at the Jonas Brothers for proof of this claim.

Electric guitars are used by [[fag|fags]] and [[emo|emo's]], largely due to the ability for their sound to be amplified or modified because they need it to cover up for their lack of skill. With certain effects, the guitar can be made to [[Slipknot|sound like a garbage disposal]] or [[dragonforce|the Super Nintendo you threw out when you were nine.]].

*'''Bass Guitar'''<br>
There are two types of people in the world: shit bass players and GOOD bass players. Many idiots think playing the root note in a rock band is all this thing can do. Unfortunately, this is because there are lot of shit bassists in the world. If you play bass guitar, you are required to know how to play "[[self esteem|Self Esteem]]" by The Offspring, "Spoonman" by Soundgarden,"Peace Sells" by Megadeth, "Schism" by Tool, and "Bombtrack" by [[Rape|Rage]] Against the Machine. But if you actually want to be good, try to learn something by Jaco Pastorius. He was a drunk retard who could still play bass better than [[you]].

*'''The extended range bass'''<br>
Carved from pure [[win]] and strung with the tears of a thousand virgins.  [[Some argue]] that extended basses [[shit_no_one_cares_about|should be considered a different instrument]]. IRL it's a bass with A LOT of fucking strings.]

==How to be a successful bassist==

* Accept that you are below everyone in the band (Including the guy who cleans up the piss and vomit at the end of your gig).
* Don't bother trying to learn to bass. Nobody gives a shit what notes you are playing anyway.
* If your singer complains about the band playing out of time blame it on the drummer and get him fired instead.
* Miss as many rehearsal sessions as you can, Instead smoke dope and masturbate, You will have a much better time.
* If you are the bassist for an indie pop band or any other faggot based genre, Shoot yourself and the rest of the band. Do the world a favour.]

[[faggot|because playing Guitar Hero songs on real guitar is cool amiright?]]

== How to Play the Guitar ==
=== DO ===
* Play songs about [[Prussian Blue|racial hatred]] and misogyny, it will make you feel like a rock star even without any money, or blow.
* Realize that you are crap at guitar. All [[unwarranted self-importance|song-writing]] will shortly disappear. People will hate you less.
* Learn how to play power-chords and leave it at that. People don't want to hear complicated [[fail]].
* Play games of [[NO U]] with complaining neighbors. Even if you suck, you can still troll the fuck out of your enemies.
* [[Black Metal|Start a band based on Norse Mythology and Face Painting, then kill other members of your band to prove that you have and evil level of over 9000]]
* Arrange a benefit concert for the people at [[Uncyclopedia]] to have [[lulz]] injected into them, play the first 10 seconds of Smoke On the Water, then [[GTFO|leave]].
* Play as fast as possible with no regard for tone or accuracy.  You'll totally impress everyone.
* Learn the [[Elitist Musical Bastards|A minor pentatonic]] scale and use it for all your [[shit|awesome solos]], even if it's totally out of key and sounds [[retarded]].

=== DON'T ===

* Consider starting guitar now. It's too late. If you were not playing [[at least 100 years ago]] then you are 1 of too many.
* Ever put [[camwhore|videos]] of you and your guitar on [[internets|the interwebs]]. There is enough shit clogging up the tubes already. 
* Have any illusions that as a guitarist, you are not [[anti-lulz]].
* Forget that [[Kurt Cobain|no one likes you]], since said is why you started guitar in the first place.


==Actually Learning the Guitar==
[[Image:Guitar scale.gif|thumb|Don't bother with this shit. ''[[Rock Band]]'' is way better.]]
Beginners can learn all manner of guitar playing tricks and master rock god techniques by playing video games like "''[[Rock Band]]''" or "''[[Guitar Hero]]''"; both of which are responsible for stupid [[teenager|teenagers]] suddenly thinking they are musicians.  These people are actually talentless fucktards, but may just add an extra [[1d20]] to a fat, [[basement-dweller|basement dweller's]] chances of getting laid. People that start playing guitar because of a video game usually learn the first 10 seconds of every song and say they know every song.
