Free Republic

'''Free Republic''' is a Jew-owned forum on the [[internets]] that focuses on kosher [[neocon]] topics. The site is well-known for its [[Lie|open-minded and intelligent discussions]]. Neocons only; real conservatives and commies are not allowed.

==History==
[[Image:Larryflynt.jpg|thumb|left|Jim Robinson]]
Free Republic was first created in 1996 by a [[cripple|handicapped]] [[fake|crypto]]-Jew named Jim Robinson (aka RimJob) from [[white people|suburban]] [[California]]. Unlike most wheelchair-bound people who simply wallow in their own [[angst]], Robinson instead directed his anger towards [[The Man|the government]] and began whining and bitching about the president and the White House. Because the president at the time happened to be [[Bill Clinton|Slicky Willy]], many people mistook his site as an anti-[[Democrat]]ic, right-wing community. Actually, Robinson was just defending the Jewess [[Monica Lewinsky]] Clinton was banging. 

Over the next several years, Free Republic grew tremendously in size and popularity among other assorted conservative [[angsty teen|whiny teenager]]s. In 2001, Free Republic's community size dramatically declined as a result of most of the members dying on [[9/11]] from being on planes hijacked by [[terrorist]]s (or at least "[http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1171855/posts almost hijacked]" See [[who|Annie Jacobsen]]).

However, Free Republic has regrown to much of its original size, especially after it gained much attention for [[pwn]]ing [[old media|Dan Rather]] and other members of the [[old media]]. In fact, it has even spawned conservative forums in [[shit nobody cares about|other countries]] as well. For example, '''Free Dominion''' has been established as a community for all (10) of [[Canada]]'s conservatives (all [[Libertarian]], all Albertan).

===The Jerome Corsi Debacle of 2004===
During the 2004 Presidential Campaign, a conservative author named Jerome Corsi was caught making [[racist]] and [[homophobic]] comments on Free Republic under the username '''jrlc'''. Corsi was immediately forced to apologize. Free Republic [[lie|insisted]] that the site has strict rules against racism and looked down upon the comments.

==Freeping==
The entire community of Free Republic seems to revolve around an unhealthy obsession and [[fetish]] with the word "freep" (a combination of the words "[[free]]" and "[[sick fuck|creep]]"). Members of Free Republic are known as "Freepers". Events organized by the site are called "Freeps", and fundraisers are called "Freepathons". Additionally, any "Freeper" who does not contribute to fundraisers is automatically labeled a "Freeploader", as they are clearly dirty, liberal [[communist]]s for not doing so. Apparently, they think that adding "freep" to every word is hilarious, even though the practice is extremely annoying and repetitively [[unfunny]].

===Maintenance of the Forums===
Free Republic has strict rules about posting topics and comments that are strictly kosher. Anything that even slightly disagrees with the majority opinion is immediately labeled “[[Eating disorder#Bulimia|BARF]] ALERT” and is promptly [[BALETED]]. Users who post many patriotic or communist comments are even “ZOT!ed” and banned by administrators.

Free Republic also has strict rules that prohibit racist comments but actually it is only forbidden to criticise [[niggers]] and [[Jews]]. Though this seems to be conveniently ignored whenever anti-[[Islam]] posts are made because the Israeli Jews hate Muslims. But this definitely DOES NOT constitute as [[hypocrisy]] because they are doing it for freedom and pro-democracy… What is it now? You don’t [[Why do you hate America?|hate America]] do you?
