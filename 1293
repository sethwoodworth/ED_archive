Call of Duty: World at War
[[Image:cod5_box.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Mega Man|Milked franchise?]] [[Guitar Hero|From Activision?]] GTFO!]]

Call of Duty - Keeping teenage pregancy rates down since 2003!

'''''Call of Duty 4: [[Electric Boogaloo|Electric War Galore]]''''', more commonly mistaken as '''''World at War''''', is a milked, half-ass piece of shit [[Expansion Mansion|expansion]] pack to ''Call of Duty 4''. Despite using the same exact engine, [[Machine code|netcode]], graphics, physics and templates of CoD4, Activision and Treyarch will try to tell you otherwise. While [[elite]] players ditched the piece of shit and stuck with CoD4, [[Newbie|newcomers]] and [[Children|kids]] praised Treyarch for their inclusion of unique and original features, like "[[Nazi]] [[zombie]]s and making [[Money|map packs]] because they [[Bullshit|care about their fanbase.]] If you like to kill filthy japs and get abused online by twelve year olds this is the game for you.

Despite being the laggiest, glitchiest, most broken piece of shit in existence, the game still sold millions. While Activision [[LMAO|laughs their ass off]] bathing in childrens' money, the game received multiple awards including [[Shit nobody cares about|Best Shooter of 2008 and Best Online Game of 2008]], the same awards given to ''[[Call of Duty 4]]''. Why? Because any [[retard]] with half a brain can realize [[Capslock|IT'S THE SAME FUCKING GAME.]]

==Story==

{{Spoiler|ALLIES WIN THE WAR, CHERNOV GETS [[Kill it with fire|FUCKED BY A FLAMETHROWER]] AND SGT SULLIVAN GETS STABBED BY A DIRTY FILTHY FUCKING [[Japan|JAP]]|}}

The campaign is the same fucking shit as ''[[Call of Duty 4]]'' but with different character models, and [[Batman|Gary Oldman]]. The story is told from two perspectives: [[American]] and [[Russia]]n. (Call of Duty 2, anyone?)

'''[[TL;DR]]:''' Americans try to raid [[Sea nigger|Makin Atoll]] but get their stupid asses caught by [[Japan|Japanese soldiers]] and proceed to [[rape]] them in their safehouse. Miller breaks free and his team make their way to the heart of Okinawa, while Jew pisses and moans about everything along the way. [[Kiefer Sutherland|Roebuck]] dies (unless you save his life in which case Polonsky dies) and as your reward, you get to [[Shit nobody cares about|keep his dogtags]] and commit [[suicide]] in disappointment.

In the Eastern Front, [[Russia|Stalingrad]] get their asses [[pwned]] by [[Germany|Germans]] and [[dog]]s. A cutscene shows some Germans [[Badass|shooting pidgeons]] and you follow Sgt. Reznov throughout the level, as he tells you when to take cover, and how to infiltrate the area. [[Call of Duty 4|Sound familiar?]] After raping more Germans with tanks and [[flame]]throwers, a guy gets [[300|kicked off a fucking roof]], the entire Wehrmacht turn into [[zombies]], and for the rest of the game you suck Reznov's [[dick]].

Most of the story is blatantly ripped from movies and other games, such as the fountain scene in Stalingrad, which would give deja vu to anyone who has seen the movie: "Eenemy at the Gates." Seriously it is literally the exact same thing, in fact if I was the producer on that movie I'd be suing Treyarch.

==Multiplayer==

The game uses the same netcode as the [[Call of Duty 4|piece of shit before it]], because Treyarch can't develop an original game for jack shit. Despite Activision basically handing them over with the entire COD4 source code and mechanics, Treyarch still [[moron|fucked up]]. The game was released with tons of bugs and glitches, including [[In the ass|going under]] maps, infinite ammo and fucking dogs. None of the problems that Infinity Ward made were fixed, and Treyarch released the piece of shit in a hurry just to make [[Whore|fast money]] off [[13 year old boy|little kids]] because nobody bought their [[gay]] [[Spiderman]] games.
Of course, everyone knows that attaching already shit plastic scopes to guns magically [[LOL WUT|increases the range but decreases the damage.]]

===Weapons===
[[Image:cod5_mp40.jpg|thumb|right|264px|The MP40 is the only weapon available in multiplayer mode.]]

==== Semi/Fully Automatic Rifles ====

Despite using ammo that could kill a Grizzly Bear, they are somehow weaker than the SMGs.

* '''Gewehr [[Rule 34|43]]''' - Semi-auto rifle that players struggle to get kills with, just to unlock the almighty "Schiessbecher" grenade launcher.  Use the Overkill perk with two grenade launchers for extra [[lulz]].

* '''M1 Garand''' - American weapon that sucks. Gee, [[Why do you hate America?|I wonder why, Treyarch?]] The only redeeming factor is an unlockable sniper scope, but it's pointless since the MP40 is already the best sniper rifle in the game.

* '''[[Gun#Sturmgewehr 44|STG-44]]''' - Despite Treyarch being of a bunch of fucking Nazis, this gun is utter trash unless you use it in hardcore mode, in which case it kills in half a bullet.

==== Submachine Guns ====

a.k.a. the most 1337 guns in the game

* '''MP40''' - Another example of how the developers [[Fail|fucked up]]. This weapon is used by 99% of online players because Treyarch, being the [[sick fuck|sick]], Jew-hating [[Nazis]] they are, love to increase the damage of all German weapons in the game. If the weapons in this game were same ones used in the [[serious|real war]], Germany would have fucked the entire planet in one day. [[WHAT|It's more powerful than the BAR.]]

* '''[[Gun#The Tommy Gun|Thompson]]''' - The somewhat less-[[Noob|scrubbish]] version of the MP40, it does less damage because Treyarch fucking [[H8|hates America]]. Either way, you're still probably using it with [[Juggernaut]], you cheap [[faggot]].

* '''Type 100''' - Thompson for Japs and [[anime]] fans.

* '''PPSh-41''' - You could use it to spray the shit out of every enemy human and dog you see, but why use it when you, being the faggot you are, can use the MP40? 'nough said.

==== Machine Guns ====

They combine the power of the rifles with the fire rate of the SMGs. They still lose to the SMGs.

* '''Type 99''' - Some Jap [[asshole]] thought it would be a [[I did it for the lulz|funny idea]] to create a powerful machine gun, and give it the worst iron sights [[ever]]. [[Loser|1337]] players use it for [[e-peen|XP challenge points]] and never touch it again. [[Protip]]: IRL the japs added bayonets to their mounted machine guns, disproving the theory that the atomic bombs made them the stupid fucks they are today.

* '''[[42|MG42]]''' - A 26 pound machine gun that you spam like its [[nobody]]'s fucking business. 

* '''FG42''' - More like FAG42, [[amirite]]? As soon as you fire it, it runs out of ammo. Despite being an automatic rifle IRL that recoiled so hard you got [[Because of Parkinson's|Parkinson's]], it's considered the best MG in the game by 13 year old boys who love that you can blow the whole mag at an enemy across the map with the telescopic sight.

* '''Browning M1919''' - [[Fiction|Players can carry two of these 103lb machine guns, along with a bazooka, 2 rockets, grenades, ammunition, and bipods while shooting, sprinting, and jumping out of windows.]]

==== Shotguns ====

Shotguns can kill in 1 hit if close enough (and the game feels like registering the hit). Compare to the SMGs which can kill in 1/2 a hit if close enough.

* '''[[Gun#Shotgun|M1897 Trench Gun]]''' - American pump action shotgun. It sucks, big surprise. The shotguns do more damage than every other weapon at close range except the MP40, yet the final unlockable attachment for it is a [[What|bayonet]].

* '''[[Shotgun mouthwash|Double-Barreled Shotgun]]''' - It does marginally more damage than the M1897 Trench Gun but it is has a shorter range (you can make it a sawed-off shotgun to decrease your range even more) and takes a long time to reload its two shots.

==== Bolt-Action Rifles ====

Pretty much useless unless fitted with a scope, because you'll just get spray n' prayed unless you're a mile away from the kids with automatic weapons.
* '''Springfield''' - The M40A3 from [[COD4]]. Iron Sights are so fucking useless that Treyarch gives you the Scope right off and then it becomes Sniper Rifle [[Jesus.]]

* '''Arisaka''' - Use it with a bayonet and become [[An hero|an Japanese hero]] fail banzai charger.

* '''Mosin-Nanget''' - The Springfield but for [[Communists]] and [[Jews]]

* '''Kar-98''' - The Springfield but for Skinheads and [[Mexicans]]

* '''PTRS-41''' - An anti-tank weapon that does hardly anything against tanks. Similar to the Barrett .50cal from ''Call of Duty 4'', you can run around and fire from the hip or shoulder with this two meter long, twenty kilogram anti-tank rifle that fires a 14.5Ã—114mm bullet. It's also clearly not a bolt-action rifle but is listed as such in the multiplayer weapon categories.  There are no attachments for it and you can not remove the scope.

==== Miscellaneous ====

* '''[[Gun#.357 Magnum - BOOM! Headshot|.357 Magnum]]''' - American revolver with high power (omigod Treyarch, you did WHAT??). You can shoot all six of its bullets in one second and fire it so fast that it sounds like it's stuttering. 

* '''[[Gun#Bazooka|Bazooka]]''' - [[C-NOTE|Hey one of ya'll bitch-niggers fuckin' answer me! Is that a bazooka right there?]] Yes it is. And you have just become +10 points in the blink of an eye.

* '''[[Gun#Flamethrower|M2 Flamethrower]]''' - The original spray cannon, Treyarch decided to [[fuck]] with it's fanbase by making the weapon available only at rank 65 in multiplayer. And [[Xbox Live|everyone]] knows that if you don't prestige, you're a [[fag]]. Drops players dead in 1 second flat because Treyarch understands the properties of fire, and how it instantly kills its victim instead of slowly burning them to death in a deliciously sadistic fashion, you sick fuck.

* '''Mk 2 Frag Grenade''', '''RGD-33''', '''Type 97 Hand Grenade''', '''M24 Stielhandgranate''' - Fragmentation grenades (Mk. 2 and Type 97) and concussion grenades (RGD-33 and M24) used by the USA, USSR, Japan and Germany respectively. Only the Mk 2 is used in multiplayer. So many grenades! On Veteran difficulty in solo mode, enemy soldiers will constantly and relentlessly spam you with grenades, which Treyarch thought was a good way to increase the difficulty on higher settings. They can drop a grenade right at your feet from almost anywhere. As in ''Call of Duty 4'', you can pick up a grenade thrown at you and throw it back if you have enough time before the grenade explodes, but every time you do, another one, perhaps several will land in front of you or on all sides. If you run from a grenade thrown at you, you'll likely step on another that was thrown somewhere else. In multiplayer, the Mk 2 is less powerful than the M67 from ''Call of Duty 4'' and a perk called "Flak Jacket" reduces damage taken from explosives, which offers some protection from grenades. There is also a perk called "Toss Back" which enables you to somehow magically add more length to the fuse of a grenade thrown at you to an extra three seconds when you pick it up.

* '''VEHICLES: Lets not forget th EP1C PH41L that Treyarch had with Call of Duty: 3 '''- Vehicles in the multiplayer. As if they hadn't already learned their lesson, they added vehicles AGAIN, making even the shittiest noob in the game God. If the player in the tank so much as even coughs in your direction, you become just another +10 for him. Tanks are overpowered machines made by Satan himself meant for the sole purpose of fucking with experienced players (a.k.a Non-Campers) until they rage quit. If you see a tank coming your way, don't engage, don't try to run. Instead, stand perfectly still and hope that the driver is a pre-pubescent 5 year old (who's parents are too drunk or stoned to care that they are playing an M game) who will mistake you for a pretty statue that seemingly has random seizures as it checks itself for whatever. Spam like hell and wait for the messages to start piling in your inbox. For extra lulz, find one specific players favorite camping spot and repeatedly kill him and only him. Tanks Will take [[Over 9000]] bazooka rockets before dieing. Don't even try to use the satchel charges on the tank as they will either run you over or ass fuck you with their canon.  

* ''' Bouncing Betty (a.k.a Those motherfuckers and their god damn BB'S!) ''' - Mines sent down to earth by God himself, meant for one thing and one thing only: to rid the world of all players on WaW. Bouncing Betty's are by far the worst idea to grace the game as any form of player set trap. These canisters that are roughly the size of your goddamn head and magically able to fit into any surface, be it dirt, rocks, mud, cement, or the fucking corpse of a fallen enemy, are insta-death to anyone who trips the non-visible wire in the 5 (million) foot trip sensor. When activated, these merciless perishable cans shoot up 10 feet into the goddamn air and asplode, killing you instantly with absolutely no chance to get away at all. Unavoidable, as they can be set ANYWHERE and are literally INVISIBLE.

==[[Nazi]] [[Zombies]]==
[[Image:cod5_zombie.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Based on actual events from WWII.]]
[[Image:cod5_pack.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Thanks for your money, suckers!]]
This is the true source of Activision's [[profit]], the [[Penis|big kahuna]] of ''Call of Duty 5''. The game mode involves being [[Rape|trapped in a room]] with your friends, killing off [[lolwut|Nazi Zombies]] that horde from outside. So, [[what the fuck]] is the big deal? [[Xbox Live|Kids actually buy into this shit.]] Some random, last-minute, sloppily coded minigame somehow became the game's largest selling point. Nazi Zombies in one sentence: You stand in the same inclosed room spamming the same guns at the same enemy who runs at you with the same animation over and over, and eventually you get to just stand there with your 4 ray guns and press R indefinately, until you commit suicide from boredom. Another main reason it sucks is because their health just keeps going up until they require [[at least 100]] ray gun shots to kill, something I'm sure everyone wants in a zombie-type enemy.

Because [[Bullshit|Treyarch cares about the players,]] every month they release a new shitty map pack priced at $9.99 for all the little kiddies to charge onto their parents' credit cards. [[Morons]] actually pay for this shit knowing that they're only using it to play one level, and will instantly buy more map packs as they get released [[truth|without thinking]]. This money is fowarded to Treyarch's [[photoshop|graphics department]] for the next title, because they will just re-use the same game, but use different textures.

If you dare to be [[gay|different]] and decide to only play the regular multiplayer and not buy the shit map packs, get ready for your game to be downgraded into a demo, despite having already paid full price for it. The new maps are FORCED into the rotation, no matter if you bought them or not. What happens if you don't have the map? You get kicked from the game and a huge screen asking you to buy the map is forced on you, reminding you that you can end your 3rd world treatment at anytime if you just fill their jew pockets with more gold. Now with 9 of these abominations released, you have a 65% chance of getting kicked from every game you try to join/want to stay in. You get to wait in line to play a game [[rage|YOU ALREADY FUCKING PAID FOR]]. But of course they do it all for the [[jew gold|fans]]. Whether Treyarch did this to sell more, or simply because they don't know how to edit their playlists to accomodate a split community, is unknown.

==Trolling==

* <s>Change your clan tag to RAIN.</s> Treyarch removed the only fun feature of multiplayer to make way for more [[Cash|Nazi Zombie map packs.]]
* Join clan battles with the tag [[hax|RANK]].
* Host a server and teamkill in [[Hardcore]] mode. Extra [[lulz]] for sniping other snipers on your team from across the map, mistaking them for enemies.
* Have your entire team use the MP40, Juggernaut and Last Stand.
* Go into Nazi Zombies with randos and play until they need a crawler. At the end of a round, insist that you will watch the crawler. While everyone is AFK [[Fapping|doing very important things]], kill the crawler and then run and activate all the electric barriers and open all the doors. For best results, leave afterwards and insist you disconected and repeat.
* Use the same tank during an entire match and brag about how you killed them with your [[badass|M1 Garand + Shades class.]]
* Identify which players are [[13 year old boy|12 years old]] or younger, and tell them that a new map pack has just been released. This will most likely cause half of the room to disconnect.
* Equip the Camouflage perk and follow enemies with a [[An hero|cooked grenade in your hand]].Treyarch even made that as a multiplayer achievement,so do it MOAR.
* Go into any forum on the game and claim that anyone who plays Nazi zombies only does so because they are too much of a pussy to handle [[Left 4 Dead|Left 4 Dead]].

==Difficulty Levels==

Recruit - Too Easy

Regular - Easy

Hardened - Bitch ass hard, because the game WILL GRENADE SPAM YOU if you stand in one place for more than 2 seconds. The programmers thought it would be a great idea to force the player to constantly move along. Except the enemy will fix you in place with a large volume of fire, forcing you to take cover and wait for a shot. The super grenades force you to move, so it is stand still and get blown up, or move and get shot. 

Veteran - More like SUPER FUCK YOU mode. Like hardened but the game's uber-grenade spam is jacked up to insane levels. But you will play it because you SO WANT the achievements.
