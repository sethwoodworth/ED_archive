[[Sceptre]] is a former [[Wikipedia]] [[bureaucratic fuck|admin]]  (LOL [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Sceptre_2 DENIED] and LOL [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Sceptre_3 DENIED]) himself.  If you've ever heard someone say that Wikipedia is run by [[angst]]y [[teenager]]s, Sceptre is the textbook example. The name ''[[Sceptre]]'' comes from his phallic obsession, in other words, he likes the [[cock]].

For the last several years Sceptre has constantly been gaining rollback powers, abusing them, then losing them, and then convincing someone to give them back in an [[period|endless cycle that repeats about once a month]].


==In his own words==
{{squote|Hello, [[USI|I'm]] <big>'''[[Powerword|Will Noble]]'''</big>. [[USI|I'm]] [[shota|17 years old]], and [[USI|I]] come from a quaint little town in a quaint little country.

==The unabridged history of our favorite little [[British|Limey]] Wiki[[nazi]]==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sceptre Sceptre] was a [[Teenager|junior high student]] named '''Will Noble''' and [[attention whore]] at the [[Wikipedia]] School for Holding the Balls of Information in a Vicegrip.  He started his Wikipedia career off by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&diff=prev&oldid=14018430 vandalizing the George W. Bush page]. He then edited for over a year there [[Fake editor|without actually writing anything important]], such as this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sceptre&diff=prev&oldid=209981960 revert of obvious vandalism].  Nevertheless, he was very successful in the [[Wikipedia#Easy_eBay_Profits:_Admin_Farms|"becoming an admin"]] process.  As one might expect, this didn't really involve a lot of actual editing.  It was mostly making friends with popular Wikipedians like [[Phaedriel]], [[nathanr]], and others, voting "support" on all the Requests for Adminship, and voting "delete" on all the [[VFD|Articles for Deletion]].  He also joined [[Esperanza]], which would later become tragically ironic.  He had quite a nice little social network going on.

Before too long, he was made an [[admin]], which was the ultimate step in his little [[MySpace]]-like activities on Wikipedia.  He even got himself a little online girlfriend.  Best of all, he could get rid of any users who he didn't particularly care for: ''Attack me, you're blocked. No questions asked.''  And blocked they were, usually for [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=Sceptre&page= ridiculously long times].  A typical block would be "indefinite: [[irony|personal attacks, being a dick]]", and no one worried because he had spent so much time brown-nosing that people didn't bother with him. Sceptre was especially fond of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=Sceptre&page=User%3AHaizum blocking established users forever] for [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=Sceptre&page=User%3ANathanrdotcom emails that hurt his feelings].

But wait!  That second link shows that he blocked [[nathanr]] forever!  But I thought they were buddies! Read on...

== Enter Matthew Fenton==
During one of those rare occasions where he was paying attention to his surroundings at his school instead of daydreaming about his wiki friendslist, he met [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Matthew Matthew Fenton], a fellow user who shared several classes with Sceptre -- that is, when Sceptre actually attended class. They had several things in common: both were overweight, sexless slobs, both had no lives, and, above all else, both were addicted to Wikipedia as badly as most dipshits and retards are to [[Second Life]].

The two became fast friends and spread disharmony throughout Wikipedia. In over two thousand separate incidents, Matthew made stupid edits and/or outright deleted user contributions to numerous articles, responding when asked for justification with acronyms like '''[[FOAD|WP:FOAD]]''' or '''[[LOL WUT|WP:IMAFAG]]'''. Further questioning was grounds for a block or ban, because Sceptre always showed up within minutes to do Matthew's bidding.

On rare occasions other admins, ones who used their real names and were easily contactable outside of the normal Wikipedia "red tape" methods of appeal, would overrule Sceptre once it became apparent that his article revisions and account blockings were committed without bothering to view the entire context of the situation, but for the most part the duet of corruption and collusion between Matthew and Sceptre continued without any lessening of their joint reign of terror.

Sadly for him, Matthew reaped the consequences of his behavior, as shown in his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/MatthewFenton repeated] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/MatthewFenton_2 attempts] to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/MatthewFenton_3 gain] adminship. Sceptre's downfall, however, was yet to come.

==The nathanr [[drama|saga]]==
The [[nathanr]] dramafest was Sceptre's undoing.  Sceptre and the twice-her-age [[pedophile]] nathanr (though he claims to only be a hebephile) both [[bukkake|took interest]] in a 15-year-old named Seargeant Snopake, another [[Phaedriel]] groupie.  Unsurprisingly, after being a cocktease to Nathan for a year and sending him lots of her nude pictures, Snopake suddenly did a 180 and was creeped the hell out by nathanr's wrinkled mancock, so she [[wikibreak|quit Wikipedia forever]] and Sceptre and Phaedriel got all pissed off at nathanr.  He even went as far as to take nathanr off his [[friends list]] (oh noes!)

Despite Sceptre being a fail throughout his life, he did have one success, which was getting laid by the young [[jailbait]] Snopake after she left Nathan.  Snopake eventually dumped Sceptre and then got knocked up by a different black man every couple of years and she leaves her kids to be raised by her parents while she goes out and parties all day (true story).  But Sceptre can count that one success out of the rest of [[fail]] that is his life.

When he got tired of fair competition for [[sex|booty]], Sceptre decided to deal with the problem in the usual way: by getting the other guy banned forever.  To do this, he enlisted the help of the overweight and tyrannical admin [[Cyde]], who was only [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=Cyde&page=User%3ANathanrdotcom too happy to oblige], and finish the job.  This block was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=ContiE&page=User%3ANathanrdotcom overturned], but it didn't stay that way.  Sceptre got his last revenge, making his block of nathanr his final administrative action.

Sceptre also ventured briefly into ED territory. He whined and cried [[Talk:Nathanr/Archive_1|here]], and [[internet tough guy|threatened editors with a crowbar]]. Eventually he got bored and left, but not before being the target of an absurd amount of [[lol|lollery]].

When Nathangate finally made it to [[Internet court|arbitration]], Sceptre backed down on his previous decision:

{{squote|...Nathan should not've been [[Ban|blocked indefinitely]]. The block I placed was... twisted... by my [[Sex|relationship]] with Sergeant Snopake.

Also, I applaud [[Tawker]] in unblocking him. I would've done it myself if I had the powers, given the actual reasons (incivility, [[Bullshit|suspected]] [[pedophilia]]) were unfounded. After all, it is a community ban, and an admin can reverse it, if he was willing to face pressure.

However, I'm a bit concerned about Nathan's anti-wiki stance recently (some over his block), his incivility towards editors he doesn't like, and also his statement about him not going to follow AGF.

I am supportive of Nathan been given a second chance, but I will accept if he is blocked for [[At least 100|a period of time]] (a month, three months, but not forever)|Sceptre}}

==Aftermath==

[[Image:Sceptre_beats_hookers.JPG|thumb|right|Sceptre engages in some introspection.]]

In an effort to save face over the nathanr episode, Sceptre gave up his adminship and got all [[Gay|emo]].  The [[attention whore]] move worked, and he got all kinds of tearful "plz come back!" messages. Shortly afterwords, he nominated himself for re-adminship, but he [[fail]]ed miserably. The [[Wikipedophile]]s finally got tired of his shit and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Sceptre_2 told him so], and he withdrew his nomination. Feeling [[butthurt]], he decided to relieve his stress by nominating hordes of legitimate articles for deletion. His [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sceptre userpage] is still full of [[USI|self-fappery]], but the pathetic humility is only too obvious. In short, Sceptre was [[pwned|pwned]] by [[drama]]. As a result, he is focused on taking down [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] by trying to convince people to [[lolsuit|sue]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tachikoma&diff=84305030&oldid=84288552 for calling them Wikipedophiles]. He has also become severely depressed due to kids bullying him at school. The bullying is believed to have been done by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=Sceptre&page=User%3ADarthDarko&year=&month=-1 people he had previously banned], unfairly, on Wikipedia. Apparently he left his crowbar at home. This led him to take a wikibreak of about 8 hours.

Sceptre continues to cry emo tears over his status at Wikipedia with a side order of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] blame. Both he and his buttbuddy, Matthew, have also abused the so-called '''[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish Right to Vanish]''' feature that [[Wikipedos]] created in order to cover themselves after being busted for being - you guessed it - Wikipedos. They even get those who they harass and bully blocked by claiming that their "real identities" have been revealed, even though they've revealed them on their own fucking user pages! LOL!!

==Sceptre’s Latest “Luv” Interests==
[[Image:Sceptreexgirlfriend.jpg|thumb|Spectre’s supposed ex-“girlfriend”]]
Apparently Matthew’s affections aren’t enough to soothe Sceptre’s broken heart. He’s since taken up [[Gay|two additional partners]] for whatever excuse for sex he claims to be attempting. One of these is your typical sodomite relationship with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Springeragh Springeragh], a known Wikipedo who’s become Sceptre’s #1 fan and supporter in recent weeks. The name “Springeragh” translates from Gaelic a language developed in Ireland by its indigenous fags to adapt to being drunk all the time while having one’s tongue up another’s arse and still be able to communicate—as “one who prefers guinea pigs over gerbils for stuffing.” Which explains the mutual attraction, as Sceptre is essentially a big fat pig who smells like a guinea wop whore’s cunt! There are rumors of marriage here on this one, which has caused Matthew no small degree of [[emo]]. LOL!!

At the urgings of his mother—a lesser-class whore in the employ of the House of Commons—Sceptre’s decided to try porking older women just to increase the chances he’ll accidentally contaminate the gene pool as his father did seventeen years ago. But since no female of any species in her right ''or'' wrong mind would allow his feeble excuse for a dick to enter any orifice she has to open, he’s been forced to beg really fat, ugly old bitches to offer him a mercy fuck.

==Like teh clap, Sceptre Comes Back: The saga continues==
Rather than actually editing on TOW, Sceptre has now turned exclusively to harassing innocent people and getting them banned permanently for [[Shit nobody cares about|minor content disputes]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive192#Sixty_Six.C2.A0.28talk.C2.A0.C2.B7_contribs.29][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Sixty_Six].   Apparently [[Lie|Sceptre has checkuser connections on ED]] as well.  WE ARE ALL DOOMED!  Way to go, Sceptre.

He's now permanently back at TOW and will be running for admin again soon enough.  Be sure to vote no to make him [[Emo|cry again]].

As part of his propaganda surge to get [[Jimbo Wales]] to back his return to adminship, Sceptre wrote a [[love]] [[poetry|poem]] to Jimbo:
{{quote|
:There once was a man, Jimbo Wales
:And on [[Porn|Bomis]] was he was having bad sales
:So he made up the [[Wiki]]
:It wasn't that tricky
:And to him is now whom [[fellatio|we all hail]]!
|Will (talk) 13:26, 19 July 2007 (UTC)}}

And then there's this particular quote that's got everyone who hates his fat little guts laughing themselves silly:

{{quote|It's a shame I'm not (an admin) anymore... I do miss the [[Penis|tools.]].|Sceptre}}

Now, be honest - how in the fuck could he miss the '''tools''' when they're still playing Wikinazi games on [[TOW]]? LOL!!

{{quote|[[JEWS DID WTC|mews lid WCP]]|Sceptre}}

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hagger&diff=206954561&oldid=206954113 Apparently he believes JEWS DID WTC.]

==Sceptre Gets All [[Butthurt]] About Wikipedia!==

Recently, Sceptre posted this little tirade about the current [[shit|state]] of [[TOW]]. It is included here for the [[lulz]]:

{{squote|[[TOW|Wikipedia]] is rotting from the inside out due to constant bickering between sides (most notably when it comes to Central/Eastern Europe). There comes a time when the general populace becomes sick of the trolls, but they will still persist, because they can wikilawyer and have vocal support from friends and countrymen, who often trolls themselves. Shockingly, even some admins support trolls. ArbCom is becoming decrepit because while decisions such as public denouncement or edit restrictions are being passed, no-one will enforce them, due to fear of the community biting or the troll harassing, and when AC do decide to ban, the troll simply evades.

We need more admins who are willing to do stuff like this. People who will not take nonsense and put the encyclopedia at whole over the rules. Admins like [[Moreschi]], [[JzG]], Neil. If you're an admin, please, don't take nonsense from trolls, use common sense and do what's good for the Wiki. If you or someone you know wants to [[Goatse|rectify]] the problem, but don't have the admin bit, go through RFA. Win the encyclopedia back from the [[trolls]].|Sceptre}}

==This Faggot Just Doesn't Stop==
[[Image:Moar_sceptre_faggotry2.JPG|thumb|The evidence is undeniable]]
[[Image:Moar_sceptre_faggotry.JPG|thumb|right|We call this hard-hitting news and drama here at [[ED]]]]
[[Image:Fuck_sceptre.JPG|thumb|right|People getting wise to this faggot]]
Once again Sceptre has raised his ugly, compacted little mongol head when it came to ED's presence on [[TOW]], by instigating and getting [[Urban Rose]] banned when she [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Urban_Rose dared to question the ongoing anti-ED circle jerk]. He not only [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard&diff=209982554&oldid=209982198 reverted her complaint about him] on the admin's notice board, but [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sceptre&diff=next&oldid=209981916 reverted her calling his ass to task] on his user talk page, as well as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2008_May_3&diff=209980693&oldid=209980219 closing her new deletion review] on ED's article, due to vandalism apparently. The nasty little faggot. As Sceptre has been denied [[Sysop|OPs]] on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Sceptre_3 an apparently permanent basis], he got one of his butt-buddies, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AGK Anthony] to ban [[User:UR|UR]] for him, getting off scot-free for his blatant dishonesty, ass-covering and faggotry. He also got some of his E-Friends to start spamming UR with emails telling her to quit trying to get [[TOW]] to live up to it's own bullshit standards, something that it has consistently failed to do. Whether or not it was because Anthony was happy to help maintain the rigid policy of censorship over ED's ongoing [[Internet]] victories or because Sceptre has photos of him with [[Wikipedophile|children]] is unclear. But the effect is the same; [[TOW]] continues to try and protect itself from avenues of honest criticism and it's inner-circle [[clique]] of [[incest]]uous editors from the [[IRL|real world]], all the while losing credibility and becoming an object of derision. So here's a big fuck you to Sceptre, Anthony and the Jimbo Wales All-Singing All-Dancing [[Clusterfuck]] and Pedo Extravaganza.

In the end however, the [[TOW]] circle jerk was able to pull their heads out of their collective asses for a split second to see the light, and promptly revoked Sceptre's [[shit nobody cares about|rollback function]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive143&oldid=211388445#User:Sceptre_and_User:Undead_warrior_abusing_rollback_and_Twinkle]. Naturally Sceptre took this crushing blow to his fragile ego in a [[lies|calm, polite, and adult manner]].


(User rights log); 00:33 . . AuburnPilot (Talk | contribs) changed rights for User:Sceptre from rollbacker to (none) (Per discussion on WP:AN; abuse)

"Per Sceptre's abuse of the rollback function, and the concerns noted above, I have revoked his access. - auburnpilot talk 00:34, 5 May 2008 (UTC)
*RickK would've ''loved'' you. Sceptre (talk) 00:43, 5 May 2008 (UTC)"

As of this writing, it appears that Sceptre has [[Wikicide|taken his ball and gone home]]. He blanked both his user and talk page a short time after it was decided to revoke his privileges, proving once again that [[TOW]] is fucked beyond all recognition when this shambling tubby pile of teen angst is the sort of material they hand out [[sysop]] status to. He made his final concession of defeat [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fordmadoxfraud&diff=next&oldid=210224613 like so]:

{{quote|Fine. [[DO IT FAGGOT|Let the trolls win]].|Sceptre, 01:12, 5 May 2008 (UTC)}}

He then recreated his page some 13 hours later and is still active to this day.

==Post-ED article nonsense==
As if clamoring for the TOW ED article wasn't enough, Sceptre succeeded in making a further dick of himself even after the article was recreated. He decided to start repetitively removing the ED URL from the article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclopedia_Dramatica&diff=212424774&oldid=212423962] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclopedia_Dramatica&diff=213134417&oldid=213134151] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclopedia_Dramatica&diff=213293116&oldid=213277054] citing Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/MONGO as the reason (the request resulted in direct links to ED being banned but not text-based URLs). He claims that the users who want the article to include a URL (which greatly outnumber the users who think it shouldn't) are secretly trying to pave the way for an external link. To add further [[goatse|insult]] to [[faggotry|injury]], when Sceptre saw that a poll about adding an external link to the article was going in favor of adding a full-fledged link, he waltzes in and declares the discussion mooted because of some stupid statement made by Jimbo [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEncyclopedia_Dramatica&diff=213294079&oldid=213288308]. Despite all of this, the article currently hosts both a URL and an external link.  

==Summer of 2008: Mental breakdown==
===He finally loses rollback===
For years, he abused rollback and people who complained about his abuse were usually banned.  But on August 6, 2008 [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez&action=history] Sceptre went into battle with [[SchmuckyTheCat]] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Criticism_of_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez_(2nd_nomination) lost], and then [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&user=&page=User%3ASceptre&year=&month=-1 lost even moar] when MBisanz [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&user=&page=User%3ASceptre&year=&month=-1 took his rollback away].  August 23rd, Fritzpoll gave it back but just four days later, took it away again and that was just one day before he got an indefinite block.

===Bedford===
[[Bedford]] was a simple, kind, 40-year-old man who only had two hobbies: perfecting articles on [[Wikipedia]] about [[shit nobody cares about|national historic sites relevant to the American Civil War]] and [[masturbation|masturbating]] to [[women|female]] [[wrestling]]. One day Bedford decided to [[party hard|mix it up a bit]] and added an entry at Wikipedia's ''Did you know... '':

Did you know...

Sceptre did not know this. Being the closeted [http://www.tpowis.net TPOWIS] fetishist that he is, he became extremely excited and had a mental breakdown which pushed him into believing that women do not belong [[in the kitchen]], but should be respected and treated as equals.

Even the [[wikipedos]] laughed at Sceptre at first but being the weasel that he is, Sceptre managed to find further proof that Bedford was, in fact, insane by lurking on his [[MySpace]]. In the end Sceptre [[unwarranted self-importance|pulled some strings]] and got almighty [[Jimbo Wales]] to desysop Bedford.[http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=19507]

===Kurt===
Apparently drunk with hubris, Sceptre begins to harass [[Wikipedia:User:Kmweber|Kurt Weber]] over the exact behavior he himself is guilty of. [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=19663&st=0 WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA]

===Criticism of...===
Sceptre officially lost it and started nominating for deletion every single article that contained the word [http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=intitle%3A%22criticism%22+site%3Aen.wikipedia.org&btnG=Search&hl=en&sa=2 "Criticism"]. Every single [[AFD]] he started was closed as [[troll]]ing by the administrators and consequently he threw a tantrum on [[WP:AN]]. 

===Sceptre hits rock bottom===
On August 28, Sceptre was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=FT2&page=User%3ASceptre&year=&month=-1 hit with the banhammer] by [[Arbitrator]] [[FT2]]. The reason? [[Wikipedia:Special:Contributions/78.105.113.152|Abusive cockpuppetry]]! Will had logged out, and as an [[anonymous pussy]] vandalized user pages and [[policy]] pages to [[harass]] [[Wikipedia:User:Kmweber|Kurt Weber]] and [[Wikipedia:User:Giano II|Giano]], and is also believed to have attempted to cloak his IP [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sceptre&diff=234796669&oldid=234566742]. The act of changing “Kurt” to [[Cunt|Kunt]] and adding gayretard to a page was deemed [[sarcasm|too witty]] for Wikipedia and his account was suspended. This was only hours after he initiated a [[drama whore|drama whoring]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Sceptre_2 Requests for Comment] on himself. It backfired horribly as after his ban by [[FT2]] it was flooded by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Sceptre_2#Outside_view_by_MBisanz people calling for his head].

But it’s very obvious that no one addicted to Wikipedia can outwait a two-month ban, and so he will evade it long before it’s over. 
Only 7 days after being blocked he was caught editing under the IP he was caught using to fuck around with before ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/78.105.113.152 78.105.113.152]) You would think someone who has been on the site most of their life would know how to vandalise properly and not be the most obvious fucktard ever.

AS IF THAT WEREN'T ENOUGH!! 2 days after getting banhammered, butthurt, and leaving forever, Spectre [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Death_Cab_for_Cutie&diff=prev&oldid=235485215 came back, in sock form]. And [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Stolen_Earth&diff=prev&oldid=235616903 came back again, in different-sock form]. And then he kept socking [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&oldid=237007992#Sceptre_block_evasion] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Sceptre] and his socks [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TUATW&diff=next&oldid=210782710 talk to themselves,] too. Apparently "retirement" now means returning with a sock puppet army.

Despite being blocked for a few months, Sceptre still continued to view Wikipedia daily. He [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASceptre&diff=240079620&oldid=240078720 whined on his talk page about his block and about users that he previously harassed being unblocked] (LOL deleted). He also checked his talk page daily, as he ended up [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=242028402 requesting by email that his page be protected due to vandalism]. In short, even when it told him to piss off, Wikipedia was still his life. 

===And just keeps going===
After whining about his block to a couple of admins and getting them to start two separate AN threads debating whether or not it was fair, some fucktard eventually allowed Sceptre to return to Wikipedia early in November 2008 (though it looks like even while he was banned he was still [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Stolen_Earth&diff=prev&oldid=253638486 writing articles for Wikipedia on Microsoft Word], even going so far as to use perfect wiki markup code and everything). 

Despite being totally unfair, the banning was good for him, so [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASceptre%2Flinks.css&diff=253918475&oldid=232601473 fuck you]!!!1!

[[Image:Sceptreracism.jpg|thumb|left|Sceptre is a fan of books that portray [[slavery]] reinstated!]]
Sceptre doesn't like [[black]]s much. He doesn't like their music much, evidently, and he is a big fan of [[old|archaic]] children's novels that make black people out to be monkeys.
He also has a subpage named "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sceptre/Mexican_girl mexican girl]" for no apparent reason.

Hey [[Troll]]s,

My name is [[Fag|Sceptre]], and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded, [[Dramacrat]]s who spend every second of their day writing [[attack]] articles. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever written any [[Featured article]]s? I mean, I guess it's fun making fun of people because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than the [[stalker]]s at the [[Wikipedia Review]].

Don't be a stranger. Just hit me with your best vandalism. I'm pretty much perfect. I was an admin for a year, and have over a hundred [[userbox]]es. What sports do you play, other than "troll sysops' [[talk page]]s"? I also enforce [[BLP]], and have a [[Phaedriel|banging hot admin coach]] (She just gave me a [[barnstar]]; Shit was SO featured). You are all trolls who should [[an hero|just kill yourselves]]. Thanks for listening.
