The '''Minecraft Forums''' are a collective of [[forever alone]] [[aspies]] who, you guessed it, play [[Minecraft]] all day erry day. The majority of the forum administration are [[furfags]], which leads to moderation similiar to that of the [[Nazi|Nazi's]]. For example, telling furries to [[GTFO]] for rubbing yiff shit in your face gets you B&... unless you're also a furfag, which bends the rules for you entirely.

The forum is owned by [[User:Citricsquid|Citricsquid]], the same [[n00b]] who gave [[Minecraft#Quatroking himself|Quatroking]] [[stupid|full ownership rights to Minecraft Wiki]].

==The Three Commandments of Minecraft Forums==
1. '''''All glory to the wise one who developed Minecraft. Anyone who opposes this is a heretic.'''''

Because Notch, the guy who developed [[Minecraft]], made his community so close to him, he has a lot of rabid fanboys dying for his attention. Notch himself browses the forums, forcing himself to read through the pile of aspergers-style humor that pops up frequently. God knows why he does this. Then again, Notch is also a confirmed 'sperg.

You will be b& permanently even if you hint the slightest at [http://www.cracked-minecraft.ru/ pirating the game], even though Notch is essentially a [[fat|fatass]] millionaire who barely manages to update the game when he promises he will. Don't mention we said that either or the entirety of [[ED]] will be banned from the forums.

2. '''''Hate is a crime. Anyone who tries to fight this may be prosecuted.'''''

Or as they put it, ''Posting messages deliberately to [[offended|offend]] or upset members of a social group (For example, [[lulz|posting images of Muhammed in a thread full of Muslims]])''. This is just a cover up for the furries who believe their fetish actually counts as a social group. Don't believe their jew lies. Simply saying "Yiff in hell furfag" can get you reported or banned.

''Discrimination against the age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, nationality, or sexual orientation of another member'' will also break this commandment. This means you cannot call out a 10-year-old retard on being himself.

3. '''''This circlejerk is open to us and us only.'''''

The central Minecraft community has a bunch of members who think they should be treated like gods for being so "high up" in the community. People with this condition attention whore constantly and demand OPs on every [[IRC]] channel they visit.

Users like [http://twitter.com/micleee Miclee] and [http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/User:Quatroking Quatroking] share these symptoms. Your best option is to ignore them and silently ban them from everything you control - they'll only get worse.

==Moderation==
{{main|Furries}}

Seeing Minecraft is a game made for aspies by aspies, pretty much every dedicated Minecraft fansite to exist has been moderated by [[furry]] faggots to the point that the places seem unfamiliar for [[NORP|normal, ordinary people]]. It just so happens that the [[IRC]] server the official Minecraft channel resides in has a #furry channel in it. Everyone in this channel also happens to be in #minecraft as well. [[Typical]]. The mods, being retarded furfags, will not ban actual trolls, but would rather ban someone who doesn't worship furries.

==Forum demographic==

Minecraft Forums are very diverse in terms of the community. It's still incredibly easy to tell what clich√© any forum member is part of:
*Username includes the name of an animal or the avatar is of one? [[Furry]].
*[[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] all over their signatures? [[Weeaboo|Weeb]].
*Retarded Neko [[loli]] shit all over their posts? Closeted furry animu [[pedo]]. Yeah, they have those as well.

It may be also handy to note that the majority of regular posters, even the furries and the weebs, are completely [[underage]] and treat the forum as a mature community for mature posters like themselves. Although it's not, and the only reason it looks so clean is because admins are quick to jump on anything mildly offensive. Oh, and the admins are also underage furries/weebs which is why the rules are so tight in the first place.

Even completely legit threads like [http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1020&t=111630&p=1636190 this one] ends up in a fight where furries get butthurt and call [[ED]] a [[Wikipedia|source of unverified information]], whilst defending themselves by calling in their [[hugbox]].

==The faces behind the forums==
Taken directly from a conveniently placed [http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=38774 Post your Picture thread]. There aren't many lulzy pics as most users lack courage or cannot find their cameras under their rolls of fat. To prove this, note that over half a million people own Minecraft. That's half a million uglies.

|By ugly I only meant "physically unappealing," I wasn't referring to the number of zits I have. :p

And, yes, I suppose that I am rather fortunate regarding acne, it's only really bad if I don't shower for a few days.

And my hair isn't anything special, I have to keep it short for school (damn Texas school system >_>). I wish I could grow it long like I used to, it looks much better like that.|Kee715 on ignoring his hugely obvious weight problem.
|"Seekercat, who can play connect the dots with a mirror."
I might have to try that sometime.

Oh, and my horrible webcam hides the true extent of my acne. ::(|Seekercat, agreeing with ED
