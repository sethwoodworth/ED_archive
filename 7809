Stephen Huff  was a small-time hustler who became [[an hero]] on [[an hero day|  april the 20th ]]  after one of his [[gay]] fetish parties spectacularly failed sometime [[last Thursday]]. 
He wanted to be Tampa's toastmaster. He promoted decadent parties filled with [[scat]] [[porn]] and [[AIDS]]. 

== Fetish Parties ==
He advertised appearances by some of the top burlesque, [[fetish]] and adult entertainers in the country. And he always promised proceeds to be donated to local charities, but instead the greedy string-haired fuckwit blew the proceeds on [[hookers and blow]], he was also rumoured to have been present at [[An Heroine| Stephanie Browns]] orgy where she was spit-roasted by two huge [[niggers]] and a [[lesbian| dyke]]

For the past three years, Huff, 35, planned one spectacular event after another. Then each party began to spectacularly fail….probably because [[fetish]] parties were so ten years ago and now its [[Shit nobody cares about]].
Hundreds of people across Tampa knew Huff for his parties and his love of [[pedophilia]]. And each new event brought a fresh round of [[lulz]] and [[facepalm| facepalms]] 

== His Death ==
Hustler Huff, wanting to make a dramatic final exit and apparently having seen the movie The Omen more than a few times, tied a noose around his neck and hovered about his second story balcony waiting for his unsuspecting, barely pubescent 20-year-old girlfriend to enter their apartment after an afternoon schmoozing with her brother.  

Hilarity ensued when Huff, wanting to be an [[loser| epic failure]], made sure his girlfriend saw him all noosed up, waved a hearty good-bye, and jumped off the balcony while shouting “[[I did it for the lulz]]”,and succeeded in removing himself from the gene pool as he landed just inches from the ground below and breaking his neck, his lifetime of thievery having been put to a merciful end.

== Suspicious Circumstances ==
Stephen had been partying with his girlfriends brother the night before his [[suicide| self-pwning]], a row had ensued over who had the biggest [[penis]], Stephens girlfriend settled the argument by revealing that she was, in fact, a [[trap]] and had a bigger [[penis]] than the both of them.
The argument continued between Stephen and the brother into the next day, when it is alleged that the brother decided that Stephen actually needed to be better hung

He left a letter, eight pages. A [[suicide]] note…..But the reality was that nobody really gave a shit and they had all prayed for this day for the past five years, even Stephens dad admitted he was “a mistake” 
His funeral was expecting [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!| at least nine thousand]] people but [[at least 100| less than 100]] came, and that was only because his family laid on free [[pizza and beer]]
