Security Faggotry
The security industry is plagued by mentally [[retarded|troubled]] fame-crazed [[basement dweller|basement dwellers]]. Its objective is nothing but securing our [[butt|networks]] and [[cock|computers]] against evil [[hackers]] (like [[Jews]] hacking your [[freedom]]) and make really big [[money|bucks]] at it.

Professionals of this industry are widely known as ''[[Security Faggots]]''. Individuals such as [[Theo de Raadt]] and the obnoxiously rude and [[obese]] [[Gadi Evron]] lurk in the streets of SecuriTown for unsuspecting customers.

Sadly, [[lulz|war]] ensues whenever a [[attention whore|security company]] has colliding interests with another, causing great amounts of flames and [[defamation]] on security mailing lists, where everyone can post [[bestiality|ecological]] protest images and [[crap|filthy art]].
