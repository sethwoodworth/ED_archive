'''Why So Serious?''' (Y SO SRS?) is a [[unfunny|new meme]] from the ''[[Batman|Batsman]]'' movie ''Teh Dark Knight'', which was called [[The Dark Knight IMDb Board|"Teh best movie evar"]] by every [[13 year old boy|13 year old fanboy]] who saw it; upon exiting the film, each group of 13 year old boys gathered together, [[masturbate|fapping]] furiously to their newfound quote. The 'tards at /b/ downloaded a pirated version of the movie, probably whilst searching for [[CP]] and decided that since [[Heath Ledger|their new favorite]] [[an hero]] keeled over epically, he should be a new meme. This meme also made a spin off as a new type of [[Oh Exploitable]] thread on [[4chan|4chan's]] /b/, and [[moar]] crappy shoops on /gif/. This meme was probably devised by /b/tards as a way to [[baleet|forget]] their horrible past with their [[300|THIS IS SPARTA!]] meme, though everyone already knows that 4chan is fucked up as it is, and the fact that this meme is just the same thing but starring [[Heath Ledger|some dead guy]] [[noone]] cares about who [[gay|wears a bunch of makeup]] and laughs [[LOL WUT|like a squirrel on a Wednesday afternoon]]. It was also [[Last Thursday|recently]] discovered that the quote is the perfect answer to the all menacing question "Why are you here, [insert name]?" from [[Chris Hansen]], thus rendering his [[pedophile|pedo-bashing]] powers useless and allowing the rape of [[loli]] and [[shota]] by [[sick fuck|sick fucks]] all across the world. Nice going, [[Heath Ledger|Heath]]! Ignore this last paragraph as it was written by an obvious newfag.

==[[Why So Exploitable?]]==
[[Image:Epic thread joker.jpg|thumb|left|The day the Joker became a meme.]]
[[Image:Not sure if serious.jpg|thumb|200px|Hmmm.....]]

It started around [[Last Thursday|July 18th, 2008]] when the movie came out and everyone was like,[[Fanboy|"OMG THAT WUZ TEH GREATEST MOVIE EVAR!!!1 WHY DID HEATH HAVE 2 DIE??!!!11!!1"]] which /b/tards thought was absolutely great too and yet again became [[fanboys]] of this movie. The post constantly changes, from a variety of pics of [[the Joker]] doing lulzy things or showing you a card that is [[Oh Exploitable|exploitable]].

* But for real, people should only say that to [[emo]]s

==The Joker Disease==
[[Image:TheJokerDisease.jpg|thumb|150px|Final stages of the disease.]]
[[Fanbois]] all across America have developed The Joker Disease from watching ''The Dark Knight''. The symptoms can include any of the following:
*Writing "Why so serious?" with your own blood all over the place.
*[[Joke|Showing everyone how to make pencils disappear.]]
*[[Fuck you|Spoiling the movie for those that haven't watched it yet.]]
*Dressing your [[gay|boyfriend]] as the Joker.
*Shouting "There's a Batman!" at random people while driving.
*Putting a smile on everyone's face.
*Inticing passing cars to hit them.
*Telling people that they're "going to put a smile on that face"

'''Now, this is a story all about how'''
'''My life got flipped-turned upside down'''
'''And I liked to take a minute'''
'''Just sit there son'''
'''I'll tell you how I became the menacing Joker of Gotham.'''

'''Well no idea where I was born or raised'''
'''An Asylum was where I spent most of my days'''
'''Spazzin' Out, Schitzin, Laughin' all cool'''
'''And all digging my way out with a stolen tool'''
'''When a couple of guards caught me out of my bed'''
'''I stabbed them in the face and now they're kinda dead'''
'''Broke out of Arkham and Gotham's where I went,'''
'''They found nothing in my pockets except knives and lint,'''

''Evening Commissioner''

'''I just wanna be the guy who's fun and feared,'''
'''And if I may say, I really dig the beard'''
'''Everyone points and call me delirious,'''
'''But I just laugh and ask, "Why so serious?"'''

'''Well I broke out some cell-mates, and set them free'''
'''And told them they were all just freaks like me'''
'''If they wanna destroy Gotham, there's just one plan,'''
'''It's obvious the only way is: kill the batman'''

'''I destroyed half of Gotham by two or three,'''
'''And I yelled to the batman, "Come on, hit me"'''
'''Looked at Gotham, as it all laid in waste,'''
'''Come on, batman, Lets put a smile on that face.'''

==The Pencil Trick scandal==
[[Image:Jokermagictrick.gif|thumb|right|The infamous Disappearing Pencil trick scene that caused [[over 9000|over a million]] [[YouTube|YouTubers]] major [[butthurt]] when trying to find it there.]]

Before the film came out, many [[YouTube|JewTubers]] found out about a scene in ''The Dark Knight'' where the Joker shows a "magic trick" and says he can make a pencil "[[In the ass|disappear]]", in which he grabs a charging black person by the head and bashes his head straight into it. Of course the [[YouTube]] community thought this was pretty hilarious because [[Truth|nobody likes niggers]] so many sought out to find the lulzy scene. Others thought this would be the perfect time to get [[13 year old boy|a bunch of views for their video]] and did some lulzy things to the Jew.

==The Real Deal==

Y'wanna know how I got these scars?<br>
My father was a drinker and a fiend.<br>
One night, he goes off crazier than usual.<br>
Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself.<br>
He doesn't like that.<br>
Not one bit.<br>
So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it.<br>
He turns to me and he says, "Why So Serious?"<br>
He comes at me with the knife, "Why So Serious!?"<br>
Sticks the blade in my mouth, "Let's put a smile on that face!"<br>
And, Y SO SRS???
