Cyberwarfare
[[File:USNEWSHACKERSCOMPUTERSBOMBS.jpg|thumb|Easilest reporting on the cyberwar.]]

The next battle for the survival of the free world won't be fought on the beaches, or in the streets, it'll be fought in [[cyberspace]]. This isn't simply a vision of the [[Warhammer 40,000|grim dark future]]; this is the new reality that we must learn to live with. Whether you like it or not, cyberwarfare will affect you and your online activities. Not only are the Chinese trying to break into your computer, but the US government is also breaking into your computer in order to uncover whether you're a part of a Chinese [[The Steganographers|sleeper cell]]. As a [[last measure|final measure]], the US government is constructing an [[Internet Kill Switch|Internet kill switch]] and [http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/09/government-seeks a secret backdoor into your systems].

==China==
[[North Korea]] isn't the only the only nation keeping [[Communism]] alive. After 30 years deprived of [[Reagan]]'s leadership, the [[United States]] let it's self get [[Rape|infiltrated]] by Communist script kiddies. While American hackers are looking for better ways to lure kiddies into [[shock sites]] and spread [[porn]], China is breading a class of patriotic, [[Maoist]] hackers who would attack sites parsing China's amazing [[human rights]] and [[Foetus soup|good taste]]. Chinese hacker groups, such as the Honker Union and Red Hacker Alliance seek to turn China into a superpower and undermine [[Tibet|Chinese separatist groups]].

===Kylin===

'''Kylin (v3)''' is a secure [[Linux]] distribution that has the official approval of the [[Chinese]] government, and it's supposed five times as secure as your [[Windows]]. Made to be un-hackable, Kylin is the first [[OS]] made specifically to screw with the [[CIA]]'s attempts to learn what's going on on the other side of the Pacific but allows the Chinese government full access to your porn. Fortunately, Kylin is simply a prepackaged version of [[FreeBSD]] and a paper tiger.

==United States==

How prepared is the United States in case of a cyber-attack? [http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/news/press-releases/2010/02/cyber-shockwave-shows-us-unprepared-cyber-threats According to one study], we're fucked. A well-devised cyber-attack could shut down the entire country without [[Madagascar|Presidential consent]].

In response, [[Obama]] created Cyber Command and [[Jew Lieberman]] crafted a [[Internet Kill Switch|Internet kill switch bill]]. As with the [[Patriot Act]], the public reception to all this was mixed. Apparently, the American people prefer Freedom of Talking Shit to preventing another [[9/11]].

==Blogosphere==
Cyberwars aren't simply fought between governments and hackers; subtle manipulation of the Internet can sway public opinion. Ever notice how a hoard of [[liberals]] appear to be stalking the comments section of [[Yahoo!]] News, or how a herd of [[conservatives]] appear to lurking on the comments section of Fox News? There are people whose sole reason for using the Internet is to advocate their political views in these comments sections. Groups like as the [[JIDF]] and applications such as the [[Megaphone Desktop Tool]] can make any critic of [[Israel]]'s policies look like an evil [[Nazi]].
