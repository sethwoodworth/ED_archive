'''Nevada-tan''', also known as '''[[PowerWord: IRL Name|Natsumi Tsuji]]''' and '''Girl A''', was a [[insane|crazy]] [[16-year-old girl|11-year-old bitch]] who killed one of her classmates with a retractable blade AKA box-cutter for calling her [[fat]] over the [[internet|interwebs]]. While the murder of children by adults is usually found to be horrifying and disturbing, the murder of a kid by another kid was lulzy enough to become another [[/b/]]-tarded meme. She's been sentenced to juvie, and won't be let out until 2013 when she can legally get drunk in the US.

Note:Actually in France now, or at least in Jan 2009. 

==Nevada-tan and teh [[Serious Business]]==
Nevada-tan had been heavily involved in the [[serious business]] that is Internet before flipping out.  She had a website of her very own, which she creatively and originally based completely on a flash horror game called ''The Red Room''[http://www.geocities.co.jp/SiliconValley/4358/red_room1.html]. She obsessed over internet urban legends, [[guro]], and other violent things that little kids with [[no friends]] flock to. On her website, she had a [[cat fight|run-in]] with a girl named Satomi Mitarai, who is more easily remembered as "Dead Jap"; namely, Dead Jap had posted some unflattering [[comment]]s on Nevada-tan's website. [[Wikipedia]] describes the run-in by saying ''there were negative comments left on "Girl A"'s website by Mitarai (specifically that she was "heavy")'', which is a long way of saying she called her a disgusting [[fatass]]. So, Nevada-tan decided to be straight-up with Dead Jap about her feelings.  One day during lunch at school, Nevada-tan took Dead Jap into an empty classroom and [[cutting|sliced]] her to ribbons. With blood all over her University of Nevada sweatshirt (hence the name), Nevada-tan then returned to class, earning her a win for apathy. [[The Man]] didn't scare her! And [[LOL|frankly this just seems so Japanese....]]

==E-fame==
Nevada-tan's antics made her an internet celebrity for [[The Internet is serious business|taking the Internet too seriously]].  She helped make ''The Red Room'' popular, even though it was in [[Wapanese]]. She also [[shit|inspired]] a wave of "fan" art about her, mostly from [[otaku]] losers who just drew her like they draw any other character, except wearing a bloody "NEVADA" sweatshirt and carrying a box-cutter. To this day, fat balding [[luser]]s and over-caffeinated /b/-tards still crank out the same "lol she killed her classmate" drawings. However, Nevada-tan's e-fame spread far beyond imageboards and crappy fan art - she caused all sorts of Jap Court Drama by making them all get into [[flame war|debates]] about lowering the age of adult responsibility so psychos like Girl A could be tried as adults. This is a common subject to bring up in threads involving Girl A because it makes the poster look intelligent and concerned about political issues - in reality, they just want the age lowered so they have more access to [[lolicon]].

==How you too can make your very own Nevada-tan fanart!==
#Draw a girl, any girl, doing absolutely anything. Hair color, age, clothing are all irrelevant.
#Preferably, but not mandatory, you should draw blood and/or a box-cutter somewhere in the picture.
#IMPORTANT! DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP: Label it Nevada-tan fanart.
