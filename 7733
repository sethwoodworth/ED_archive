The [[internet]] is a dangerous place. For all intents and purposes, that [[16 year old girl|hot, underage blonde]] you agreed to meet in a dark ally may in fact be an [[80 year old Chinese man in panties|ugly eighty year old man]] with [[rape]] on his mind. Not to mention the the [[fact]] that [[goatse|one-hundred]] [[goatse|percent]] [[goatse|of]] [[goatse|links]] [[goatse|lead]] [[goatse|to]] [[non sequitur|Goatse]]. One must be wary, because after prolonged exposure to internets, one may end up [[furry|joining]] [[/b/tard|the]] [[basement dweller|endless]] [[world of warcraft|hoards]] [[Asperger's syndrome|of]] [[star trek|other]] [[sick fucks]] floating around the wide, wild internets. And we can't have that, now can we.

==Spotting afflicted individuals==  
It's relatively easy to single out those who spend too much time on the internet. here are some simple pointers that can help any normal, sane person identify and study this interesting phenomenon.

* 1. Subject has bone white skin, and cannot tolerate sunlight, much like an [[basement dweller|albino]].
* 2. Subject is beyond obese, having transmuted into a creature of [[obese|pure, weapons grade lard]].  Or subject is beyond skinny, having turned into an emaciated twig comparable to a starving Ethiopian.
* 3. Subject has little to no tact when dealing with attraction to the opposite or ([[jailhouse gay|far more likely, as the internet is a huge sausage fest]]) the same sex.
* 4. Subject's [[e-penis]] is bigger than it's real penis. (Although this is a given, it needed to be said.)
* 5. Subject has fapped to something, or everything on [[fchan]].
* 6. Subject is Korean. 
* 7. Subject engages in the sexual activities related to [[furry|their]] [[infantilism|disgusting]] [[shitting dick nipples|fetish]] in public, as though they have no shame, or that somehow normal society approves of someone fucking a dog in the ass on the street corner, while wearing a badly constructed fox suit.
* 8. Subject refuses to consume anything but [[Weeaboo|Pocky and Red Bull]].
* 9. [[Rule 34|You have porn of it.]] (it is Steam Locomotives)
* 10. Subject has the distinct scent of bedsores about it.

* 12. Subject knows what the Hayes command set even is.
* 14. Subject has taken a picture of your [[cat]] and captioned it.
* 15. Subject has [[raped]] your cat and captioned it.
* 16. Subject [[fuck you I'm a dragon|thinks it really is a giant flying anthropomorphic taco]].
* 17. Subject is [[internet poor]]
* 18. Subject takes pride in it's "alternative lifestyle", and lashes out at anyone who calls them on their [[fucktarded|appliance fetish]].
* 19. Subject starts developing [[internet troll personality disorder]] and gradually loses the ability to distinguish between trolling and acceptable behavior.
* 20. [[You]] made this list.
* 21. [[You]] read this list.
As one would naturally assume, [[you]] are spending too much time on the internet. Become [[an hero]] and thin the herd a smidge, would you? HA just kidding we both know if you've made it this far into the article that you have spent too much time on the internets.
