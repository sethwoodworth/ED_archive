[[Image:Youngpaperlilies.JPG|thumb|right|Paperlilies proving quite conclusively that making crap videos is [[Serious Business|SRS BUSINESS!]]]]
'''Paperlilies''' aka Byrony is no longer a [[Liar|gentleman's]] [[camwhore]] now that she is [[Pregnant|pregnant]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRceie6ZFoo with 50 babies.] She can no longer make fap videos, extract payment through donations and sell her [http://www.cafepress.com/paperliliestore used underwear] on [[eBay]] like other high priced [[Whore|escorts]] as the [[Pedophilia|40 year old men]] now know she has been defiled.


Check this video by Byrony's best [[friend|friend]] (and some say [[camwhore|replacement]]) Katers17, who also shot the video. Wow, what a [[bitch|nice]] thing to do! Perhaps she will buy the baby something with all that YouTube [[Money|revenue]] that Paperlilies has given her.

Paperlilies said that she would not post any more videos until anti-[[hater]] measures were introduced to YouTube, which was just a KKA lie to give credibility to Damien Estreich's claim to be in touch with the community's harassment issues and to cover up that fact she was pregnant. ''Note the Hair Disaster below. Yep, it always goes wrong when you're knocked up! ''

Paperlilies being as honest as she "can" be, a task made much easier by her taking a step away from the unethical [[YourTubeNews | YourTubeNEWS]] channel.

== The Drama ==

[[Image:YourTubeNewspaperliliesKKA.jpg|thumb|right|Paperlilies. Pay-to-play.]]
In order to increase her customer base Paperlilies teamed up with Internet scammer [[Damienestreich | Damien Estreich]] (who had been pestering her for weeks to "show tits" by pretending to work for [[YouTube]]), and they created the [[YourTubeNews | YourTubeNEWS]] channel in September of 2006.

Whilst Damien Estreich has been busy harassing the worker drones in the [[YouTube]] Head Office to keep them press-ganging subscribers onto the [[YourTubeNews | YourTubeNEWS]] channel, Paperlilies has been quietly  selling her underwear and used-tissues to all the [[Wankers | YouTube members]] that Damien sends to her channel. Estreich's [[Hookers_and_blow | HouseOfJigsaw promotions]] "business" has also seen to it that Paperlilies has made frequent appearances on the [[:Image:YourTubeNewssignup_invitepage.jpg|YouTube Signup_invite page]] and that she has had one of her videos featured.

[[Image:YourTubeNewsCrapFeature1.jpg|thumb|right|Paperlilies. IRONIC/SATIRICAL VIDEO ABOUT SARCASM]]
*1,000,000 people watched this video.
*1,000,000 people understood it.
*1,000,000 people thought it was crap.
*1,000,000 people were '''not''' wrong.


This video should never have been featured on the YouTube front page. The only reason it was featured was because of [[damienestreich | Damien Estreich]] harassing the drones at [[YouTube]] Head Office to get it featured. 

In 90% of the cases where people ask the question ''"WTF? Why was this shit video featured?"'' the answer is simply Damien Estreich was paid (in dollars/shoutouts/credits/e-blowjobs) to promote it.

In return for this [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/The_Kewl_Kids#Mutual_Assistance Mutual Assistance] from Estreich, Paperlilies is an obedient member of the [[The_Kewl_Kids | The Kewl Kids Association (KKA)]] which Estreich runs. She makes videos in support of all [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/The_Kewl_Kids#The_Kewl_Kids_Association_Financial_Activities KKA scams] and used her begging expertise to great effect in the recent [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/The_Kewl_Kids#Bobs4Kim Bobs4Kim swindle].

According to one of her her latest videos she believes that any [[Wanker | gentleman]] would be happy to make a donation of Â£200 to take her to an exclusive [[Blowjob | lunch]].

If every single stupid thing that Paperlilies said in her '''RE: Bobs4Kim''' video was reposted in this document, the article would immediately become [[TL;DR]]. 

Video containing Paperlilies lies about not placing more videos on [[YouTube]] until all the haters that her scam-featured IRONIC/SATIRICAL VIDEO ABOUT SARCASM video created are dealt with.

YTwatchdog ([[Furries | lulzy furry]]) gave Paperlilies some helpful advice in her time of "'''not''' posting anonymous videos on [[YouTube]] under new channel names in defence of exposed Internet scammer Damien Estreich".

== Did You Know... ==

*Paperlilies once made around $1000 dollars selling several pieces of 'art' on ebay, the art now serves as fap fodder for several middle aged men desperate to get into her panties.
*Paperlilies then sold the used paint water for $40.
*Buoyed by her successes, Paperlilies then sold 16 jars of [[cum|jizz]] she had collected from various 'friends with benefits' over the course of the past week. It is rumoured [[TheAmazingAtheist]] purchased at least 11 of them to inspire him while writing his shitty poetry.
*Paperlies claims that [[Damienestreich | Damien Estreich]] '''will not be making any money''' from promoting [[Miaarose]].
*Paperlies also claims that Bobs4kim scandal was not a scam, that people are jealous over her subscriptions on [[YouTube]], and finally [[Kimberleigh]] didn't know about the so-called [[Stickam]] "charity".
*Paperlilies was back on the [[The_Kewl_Kids#Ongoing_Kewl_Kids_Association_.28KKA.29_Scams_and_Systems_Abuse | Signup_invite page on 24 June 2007]], gaining another 2500 subscribers (that have never watched any of her videos) for people to be "jealous" over.


== Hair Disaster ==
[[Image:Omgwtfhappenedtomyhair.jpg|thumb|350px|right|TonyStockert buys time]]

[[TonyStockert]] made a goodwill gesture to [[ED]] by providing a shocking photograph of PayPalilies recent Hair Disaster.  However he is deep trouble with ED and is trying to trick Paperlilies into providing him [[FilthyWhore]]-style n00dz that he can pass on to ED to buy more time for himself.

== Shitty Blog ==
Like many Internet Celebrities who happen to have [[Unwarranted Self Importance]], [[PayPal|paypalllies]] happens to have a [[shit no one cares about|blog]]. You can effectively troll it [http://misslilies.blogspot.com here.]

== She gets her adsense account [[banned|BALEETED]] ==
{{quote|I got an email earlier from adsense saying they were closing (and deleting) my adsense account due to illegal activity, ie, I guess that people have been clicking on links too much or something. I never asked anyone to do that so I don't see how they can decide that there has been any illegal activity.

The main reason I am upset over this is because the youtube ad-revenue is run through the same account as this one so if it's been closed then I am totally fucked, basically. |paperlilies on the discovery that her precious internets golds are gone}}

{{quote|I have gone through the appeals thing they have, and also emailed the people who I have any contact with at youtube, but so far haven't heard back (well it was only a few moments ago).

The FAQ on adsense is like '[[banned|you did something, but we aren't at liberty to say what it was.]]' Google is like big brother or something! I haven't even asked people to click my ads in emails or anything! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME GOOGLE??!?

I couldn't even fill out the appeals thing properly because it asks for some code which I don't know how to get. I imagine it would be n my adsense account, but I don't have access to that, obviously. |still butthurt over the loss of her black person rich lifestyle}}
