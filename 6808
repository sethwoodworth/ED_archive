[[image:Sektie-mugshot-fat.jpg|thumb|Here's Sektie's fat mugshot from the Cobb County, GA Sherriff's office in 2004.  We don't know what she did but most likely it involves being an abusive whore of a mother and, in all likelihood, being fat (5'6" 190lbs LOL).  Enter her name [http://www.cobbsheriff.org/Inmate/Enter_name.shtm here] and view her rap sheet!]]

[[Image:sektienazi.jpg|thumb|Infamous Jewhater and a total fatbitch]]
[[Randi Harper]] aka "sektie", "sektorgrrl", "sekt0rgrl", "miSSpIgGy" or "freeBSDgirl", (among other [[sockpuppet]] irc aliases) is a [[batshit insane]] [[attention whore]] who is filled with unending hate for [[Girlvinyl]]. 

Randi was forced to resign from [[Yahoo]]! where she railed meth in the bathrooms and played [[WoW]] at her desk all day. She was also fired from her previous employer ISS.

==Worlds Best Mother==
In approx 1997 when Sektie was [[16 year old girl|16]], a [[fat]] ugly [[irc]] nerd with the nick  "[http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://uglypig.org uglypig]" (no-joke) she carded her and her [[b/f]] a bus ticket to New York where they lived off of [[carded]] pizza and carded cheeseburgers and sat around having gross fat ugly [[bestiality|illegal pigsex]] together until the fateful day when fat ugly [[retard|pigbaby]] was born. Not wanting a child, but seeing an opportunity for profit, Sektie sold the baby to known [[pedophilia|pedo]] [[RLoxley]] (see: [[bantown]]) for +o on #hackphreak. As we know, the [[internets]] are [[serious business]] and giving your child away for ops is absolutely worth it. RLoxley sold the baby to some fellow [[NAMBLA]] pals on [[eBay]] and to this day Sektie has not seen or spoken with parents or child again. This was after she offered to randomly ditch her kids outside a church to go live in [[Australia]] with Satyricon who then refused her offer to state she was too fat.

At some point later, Sektie somehow got knocked up again, and did the same thing with the baby. Perhaps for +o on #hack? 

Sektie has a third child who currently lives with her step-dad and ex-husband. Probably because CPS caught on about the meth habit. You can't spell [[Meth|METH]] WHORE without MOTHER!

Some Sektie quotes on her non-addiction to meth (all of these were within a 5 minute conversation): 

#She has been a meth user for 4 years but has "never gotten [[addict]]ed" 
#"Can you get meth?"
#"Do any of your friends know where to get meth?"
#"Are you sure you don't know anyone who can get meth?"
#"I'd really like to score some meth."

===Sektie really good at supervising her kids===

''Since I needed a place to live too, Google boy and I got a loft in the same building he used to live in. The loft is gorgeous. It's got 12' ceilings, all concrete and stainless steel, top floor, 1500sq ft. My bedroom is facing the city, and 3/4 of the wall is glass with sliding doors out to the balcony.''

''Nathan was over this past weekend. It was his first look at my new place. We had the windows open, and when we weren't looking he apparently amused himself by throwing socks and waffles (???) out the window at people. Good going, Nathan. You are so grounded.'' -- Sektie

Wow, she's sure doing a great job of ensuring the safety of her child! Sektie should write a book on [[1337]] parenting skillz.

==Internets==
Sektie was backdoored the day she installed Linux, but an unnamed party took great pity on her fate and alerted her to the presence of said backdoor. To this day the person who backdoored her remains quite angry that this was leaked.

She also got backdoored by [[zb]], as shown by [http://flickr.com/photos/freebsdgirl/17145284/in/photostream/ her flickr account]. For some reason zb has no shame in banging this fat pig and freely admits it, but then again zb has never had shame in doing anything.

===Mike Lockhart aka calib0rx===
While in [[Atlanta]], Randi was able to secure a spot in the soft, BDSM-loving heart of the EFNET goon calib0rx. As you can see, he wants her to be something with a collar on. Some sort of a pig-beast? We're not sure, you be the judge.

 Ok, I WILL regret sending this later.  I'm looking at the collar and
 cuffs...
 Fuck.  You want to know what I really think?  If you reply with yes, I'll
 tell you.
 This has nothing to do with our relationship.  This is about what I wanted
 you to be when  you put that collar on.
 I felt ashamed for so long.  Not anymore.  If you want to hear this, cool,
 if not, well, 's ok :)
 Yes i've been up all night.  And I have no idea how you'll react to this.
 But I want not you, but i want you to want that collar, that reminder.  To
 want to be pushed, with pain and emotion.
 So many things i never said because I was to ashamed.  No more.  In the
 books, Jonathan wasn't all there.  I would have been him until this week.
 Maybe you won't be offended by this.  Dunno if i could tell you some of the
 things sober, but we could do it on the phone.  I'll definately need a few
 drinks.
 Again, this isn't about you and i being together, the recent events, etc. I
 want to know the feeling of having complete and utter control over you.
 Sounds wierd hearing it from me eh?

===[[Unwarranted Self Importance|I run a fairly high-profile blog]]===
Randi decided to ignore the sage advice from [[Advice Dog]] and create a [[Livejournal]] account and ask abortionhelp for additional information on an abortion. Perfectly sound advice, right?

{{squote|'''I run a fairly high-profile blog (non-lj), and I've had to keep all mentions of this out of it, because I'm worried about the attacks.'''|[[Trolls]] know no limits, not even livejournal}}

{{squote|'''I'm nearly 15 weeks pregnant, and I've been trying to get an abortion since I knew, 7 weeks ago. I realize that's a bit late to be finding out that I'm pregnant, but my period is always a bit questionable, and I just didn't think I could be pregnant.'''|Its easy to confuse morning sickness with methamphetamine induced vomiting}}

{{squote|'''There haven't been any 'accidents'. The condom never broke, as far as we could tell, and he checked.'''|[[Fuckin_Magnets|Condoms, how do they work?]]}}

{{squote|'''The other place made me feel like I was doing something wrong - like I was a low-life slut making bad decisions.'''|[[Fact]]}}

===FreeBSD harlot===
"Freebsdgirl" constantly talks about [[FreeBSD]] and how great and awesome it is. Like other people that have an operating system in their nick (ex: [[Linuxbeak]]) she knows nothing about her OS of choice that could not be garnered from reading basic HOWTOs on the Internet. In casual discussion she may mention about how she spent her weekend writing kernel drivers or optimizing a threading model, but FreeBSD is conspicuously absent of kernel commits by Randi. She is basically the type of cocksucking [[toresbe|know-it-all]] failure that lurks [[Slashdot]], except she's female. [[Tranny|Or at least so we think]]. She posts 'help' on lists without reading [http://unix.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/FreeBSD/questions/2005-04/2029.html what people said] because [[dumbass|she knows best]]. Solves vague problems by asking even more [http://unix.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/FreeBSD/questions/2005-04/2020.html vague questions] but still thinks she is a [[unwarranted self importance|genius]] because she is a [[In the kitchen|girl]] that can use an [[shit nobody cares about|alternative OS]].

===Dr. Hamstuh===
While she was living in [[Atlanta]] and working for ISS, she agreed to have Dr. Hamstuh (an [[EFnet]] personality who is an [[IRL]] [[homeless]] [[crack]] addict, no joke) over at her place (probably for sex). Apparently, the rough streets of Atlanta are more tolerable than sharing a bed with Sektie because he left in the middle of the night without a word to her. He emptied her fridge of [[beer]] and [[pizza]] on his way out.

[[Image:Sherrodvsgammara0of.jpg|thumb|Here [[You]] are, ruining Gamera.]]

==Everyone who dislikes her is girlvinyl==
[[File:Trubbleyo.jpg|center]]
If you ever disagree with Sektie you're either Girlvinyl, just another Girlvinyl, or just another Girlvinyl fanboy. She has [[Timecube|IRREFUTABLE PROOF]] and she will pay ten thousand dollars to anyone who disagrees and can prove they are not Girlvinyl. She has such a [[fat|nice personality]] that [[noone]] could possibly like her because of her meth obsession, her [[Asperger's syndrome|know-it-all demeanor]] or her acting like a stupid [[cunt]]. Quotes like this:
 03:31 <sektie> that's ok though. you're just another girlvinyl. 
       lord knows [[IRC]] doesn't have enough of those [http://web.archive.org/web/20070607222434/http://freebsdgirl.com/2005/03/more_attention_whores_on_the_i.html]
... or this:
 17:50 < randi> [[weev]]: tsk. go [[fanboy]] girlvinyl.
are common sightings around Sektie. This is because Sektie is so whacked out on meth that she has begun to see tiny blue Girlvinyls everywhere.

==Quotable Randi==
 sektie: i'm going to write a book
 sektie: and it's going to suck.
 sektie: it's going to suck worse than i do.
 sektie: i've decided i have no writing skill whatsoever.
 sektie: i'm devoid of talent
 sektie: all i have is breasts
 sektie: and with age, even those will sag 
 sektie: and then i'll have nothing.
 sektie: i'll have no talent, saggy boobs, and a stupid book.

When Sektie had a moment of clarity and she realized how worthless she was.


 18:50 <@sung> how do you move into a rent control place?
 18:51 <@randi> you fuck a boy, move in with him, and then break up with him and kick his ass out.

 18:58 <@randi> adrian was good in bed. very good, in fact. however it did not make up for all of his drama
 and baggage. then when i was running meetbsd, which i *sponsored* his plane tickets to  come to, he spent
 the entire time working and not actually paying any attention to the conference. instead it was igor that
 was all "do you need any help? are you doing ok?" etc. it was a lot of stuff. then he was asked to leave my
 apartment because i was having a party and all he was going to do was sit around and work and be a killjoy,
 and he said he would leave, but then he didn't. then he threw a chair at my best friend. so then it was
 over, more or less.
