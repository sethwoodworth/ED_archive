'''P90X''' or ''Power 90 Extreme'', is an [[EXTREME ADVERTISING|EXTREME TRAINING SYSTEM]] that will transform your scrawny [[basement-dweller|basement-dwelling]] frame from a pasty, blob-like mess into a chiseled, hot, pussy-magnet in just ninety days (that's three months, you [[retard]]).  It's designed to work with the equipment you've already got laying around the house (that you already don't use), so that you don't have to buy anything beyond the DVDs.  [[No|Sweet, right?]]

'''TL;DR:'''

''Yes, 18-year-old, you do have potential.''

==The Program==
''Here’s what you get with P90X:''
For the low cost of just $120 you'll receive the following DVDs (or you could always just [[bittorrent|download them for free]]).

01 '''Chest & Back''' You may recognize these as pull-ups and push-ups.  Not surprisingly, [[you]] still can't do more than one.

02 '''Plyometrics''' Jump around like a [[fucktard]] for 45 minutes.  [[Your mom]] calls this pilates.

03 '''Shoulders & Arms''' As frequent [[masturbation]] has taken care of these muscle groups, you can skip this disc.

04 '''Yoga X''' It's fucking yoga.  There's no such thing as extreme yoga.  Get over yourself.

05 '''Legs & Back''' [[Anal|Squat, lunge, and pull]] in a total-body workout like no other.

06 '''Kenpo X''' Remember Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers?  That.

07 '''X Stretch''' Was originally named Yoga X part 2.  

08 '''Core Synergistics''' Fancy words for [[ALL CAPS|MORE PULL-UPS]].

09 '''Chest, Shoulders & Triceps''' Now you can really get some mileage [[USI|out of your mirror]].  Sexy is sexy.

10 '''Back & Biceps''' You'll make those faggots on [[teh internets]] real [[dickneck|jellyous]].

11 '''Cardio X''' [[X is now a meme|Running in place is now Cardio X]].

12 '''Ab Ripper X''' Drink an incredible six-pack and improve your [[Mill Park Tree|driving performance]].

Plus, get these informative tools:

* 3-Phase Nutrition Plan. Phase 1, stop eating like a fucking pig.  Phase 2, stop eating prepackaged bullshit.  Phase 3, repeat.
* P90X Fitness Guide. Since 12 DVDs didn't get it through to you, maybe an 8-page fitness guide will.
* How to Bring It Video. [[Redundant|Get a quick video overview of the videos on the DVD]].

And get these tools to keep you motivated:
* P90X Calendar. [[Shota|Tons of hawt guys]] showing off their ripped abs just for your inspiration.
* Online Support. You'll have access to [[guido|Tony]] and other fitness experts, and peer support from your fellow P90Xers.

Aside from the 12 DVDs, the nutrition plan, the fitness guide and the [[Sup dawg|video recap of the video recaps]], you'll need some extra equipment.  These include a pull-up bar, a fan, 10-15 lb weights (or some big-ass rubber bands for you real roughnecks), some jack-off gloves, a pair of shoes, a yoga mat, and a Chinese plastic chair from Walmart.  If you couldn't tell by this point, this is [[419|one professional setup]].

[http://www.youtube.com/user/dude04345 This dude] is all over it - fired the fuck up and swallowed it hook, line and sinker.  Now he's ready to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|PUMP YOU UP]]!  Take notice of the exotic (patent-pending) exercises such as the push-up.

==Forums==
[http://teambeachbody.com/connect The official forums], fun to be had by all.  Well, some.

Most other groups focused on health and working out see P90X as [[the cancer that is killing b|the cancer that is killing fitness]] and as such can be properly trolled with it. [http://www.ironmagazineforums.com Iron Magazine] (must be a bitch to ship those) has very friendly forums.  Drop in and tell them how great P90X has been to you and how everyone should drop $1000 on it straight away.
