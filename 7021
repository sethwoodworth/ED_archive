'''Fat Fuck''', also known as “'''[http://www.fordonford.com/ Rob Ford]'''” and “'''[http://canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/28169 Toronto’s Sarah Palin]'''” is mayor of the City of [[Toronto]].  He has been known for controversy in the past being arrested on [http://www.eyeweekly.com/article/102889 DUI and Marijuana possession in Miami], he has also been arrested due to allegations of [http://torontoist.com/2008/03/rob_ford_arrest.php abuse] by his wife, charges were dropped but it is rumored that he beat the charges out of her.  Sounds like my kinda [[fag]]! 
Fat Fuck was the front runner in the City of [[Toronto]] Mayoral Elections 2010 and he used a brutal and insensitive approach to his campaign.

==Campaign==

He has changed his campaign and is taking an even more controversial approach and running with the [http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101012/attack-signs-university-avenue-101210/20101012/?hub=TorontoNewHome new slogan] "Wife beating racist drunk for Mayor"

During an interview that got heated our contender was called a “Fat Fuck” by the [[fag]] journalist, but like the [[Niger]]s he is taking it back and running for mayor as “Fat Fuck,”  as you can see in the poster below he is embracing his immaturity and infantilism fetish as well.

==Homeless Policies==

His distaste for [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YZQ4oQjxgc homeless people] and their lack of job security, has made him decide to destroy all shelters as they cause problems for the people who are warm in their homes.

==Transportation/Suburban Utopia Plan==

He has a controversial plan which starts with the [http://www.torontolife.com/daily/informer/mayor-may-not/2010/09/08/rob-ford-unveils-transit-plan-remove-streetcars-get-cyclists-off-roads-expand-subway-only-in-burbs/ removal of all streetcars] and [http://www.treehugger.com/files/2010/09/bikes-streetcars-under-threat-politicians.php bike lanes] in the city, this is planned to be finished in the first week of duty.

Fat Fuck’s strategy also includes removing all sidewalks so that there is more room for cars and he plans to have this finished within the first three months. Next the most drastic and brilliant step is to tear down all buildings above 5 stories and build suburban complexes; borough by borough. He plans to complete this in his 4 year term.

==Work and Immigration==

Realizing he can capitalize on ignorance and racism Fat Fuck is brilliantly using campaign posters based on his previous statements. [http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/21463--asian-protestors-stage-city-hall-sit-in-over-rob-ford-s-oriental-comments “Those Oriental people work like dogs”] Fat Fuck states; he continues with a comment on the quality of their rugs.  To further his [[suburban]] gentrification plan Fat Fuck will [http://www.cp24.com/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100818/100818_debate/20100818/?hub=CP24Home “close the door”] on immigration in [[Toronto]] and enforce that all restaurants only serve meat, potatoes, donuts and [[breast]] milk.

==Tough Love==

He is against all forms of democracy and plans to turn Toronto into a Country State in which he is the dictator.  He is upset that the [[G20]] protesters were destroying the city before he could and [http://www.insidetoronto.com/news/cityhall/article/844755--councillors-defend-toronto-police-service-s-handling-of-g20 wishes the police would have used more force] when dealing with the [[socialist]] [[hippies]].

[[Image: Ford_G20_poster.jpg | frameless | 500px |]]

To ensure that Toronto is run like the US during [[Dubya]]’s [[America]] he is also [http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100927/TO-ford-marathons-100927/20100927/?hub=TorontoNewHome banning all marathons] thus turning his country into the fattest in the world.  His plans to faze them out includes moving them into city parks, critics believe this is part of his plan to destroy the parks and make room for automatic feeding fast food restaurants.

His final dream for the Republic of [[Toronto]] is to provide everyone with hover-couches, thus creating less and less use for legs and other forms of physical mobility. This is one country I can see myself lounging in and my blobs of children growing out in!
