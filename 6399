Phreaking means [[hacker|h@x0ring]] fonez, you know, those old things [[you]]r [[parents]] use to  talk to other [[old people]]. Phreaks were [[hacker|hackers]], before there were [[hacker|hackers]].

==OMG LEET PHREAK==
Back in the 1960s, some blind kid named Josef Carl Engressia a.k.a. [[Fag|JoyBubbles]] who was sexually abused by a nun as a child learned that when he farted at just the right frequency, the fone system [[shit|shat]] itself, allowing full control and shit. This [[goatse|opened]] up a ton of possibilities, allowing people to make [[nigeria|free calls]] by [[phuck]]ing with fonez.

The magical frequency was 2,600hz. Phreakz soon built blue cages that contained midgets that could fart at exactly 2,600hz, giving rise to the name blue box.

On an odd note, Joybubbles (mentioned above) learned how to do a bunch of this stuff, and passed it on to kids at his blind kids camp. So alot of the early phreaks that really got into this shit were blind, because what the fuck else are you gonna do, amirite? And here's the kicker: They can't stop this shit, ever. To change the tones, or what they do would entail replacing every phone in the entire world.

Phreaking was common among the 1980s basement [[anarchist]]s, [[hacker]]s, [[MIT]] [[asian|students]] and generally [[retard]]ed people. [[Textfile]]s were the main form of communication for phreaks, which is quite [[irony|ironic]] considering how [[Lol|THEY HAD PHREE PHUCKING PHONE SERVICE]].

Extremely detailed instructions, and stories about this cromagnon [[Anonymous]] can be found in the Jolly Roger Cookbook if anyone can dig it up <s>([http://anonym.to/http://rapidshare.com/files/170998549/anarchistcookbook2000.pdf.html Cookbook get])</s>(phucking phail). The colored boxes give one an ungodly amount of power over the phone system when used correctly. (Note a lot of the boxes in the Jolly Roger are complete bullshit, out of the ones that actually worked very few still work today) Just don't do it from your fucking house, the shit is federal. One of the old phreaks ended up making a shitload of the blue boxes small enough to fit in a cig pack for the mob. Ma Bell was not amused.

Video that explains it quite nicely, it is quite lengthy, but nonetheless good: http://anonym.to/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5464925144369700635

==OMG MOAR COLORS==
Once the whole free calls at home thing got old, phreaks decided to phuck up payfones aswell. Someone discovered that nigger midgets could fart the tone thats produced by inserting a quarter into a payfone, so they put them in a smaller red cage and called it red-boxing.

Then some phreak built a box with a [[gay]] midget inside, hooked up to a generator. The Phreak then hooked the box up to the phone system, and put a picture of black person in the box. The midget then [[fap]]ped, feeding enough electricity into the phone to give Ma Bell menstrual cramps.  This was called the rainbow box. [[LOL]]

And some phreak built some other fucking box, using the 1337hz tone.

==Misc bawkes==
* Red bawks - Basically, in the early days (and some places today), the insertion of a coin would cause a specific tone to be output. People found that by recording these and playing them back, they could get free phone calls. The most popular version was created by replacing the crystal in a Radio Shack tone dialer which would cause it to generate the proper frequencies. Today it is easier to use an MP3 player or other digital audio device.

:* If you find a pay phone that is operated by the local telephone company there is a chance you may still be able to red box it. Ask the operator to dial a number for you, when they ask for your money play your red box tones and hope they accept it.

* Blue bawks - This was a box that gave the normal person the ability to act as an operator, again, because of certain tones. Hasn't worked in the US since the mid 80's.

* Beige bawks - This 'box' is built at least once by everyone and their grandmother. All it is, is two alligator clips spliced with the line from a phone cord. It is used to clip on to a phone line from the telephone network interface (the box with a phone logo on the side of the building) <s>The red wire is clipped on to the right terminal and the green wire clips to the left. </s> This is not 1972 and polarity does not matter. You can now place calls using that buildings phone line.

* DiTTo bawks - This is a phone with an added mic mute switch that can output audio to an external source such as a stereo or tape recorder, a sort of phreaker's wiretap. DoctoR DiTTo's original tutorial can be found [http://anonym.to/http://www.artofhacking.com/TUCOPS/PHREAK/BOXES/misc/DITTO.TXT here].

*Silver bawks - Did some [[shit nobody cares about]].

*Gold bawks - Allows the user to be [[Partyvan|Partyvan'D]] at speeds thought previously unattainable.

*Green bawks - [[Moar]] [[shit nobody cares about]].

*White bawks - Even [[moar]] [[shit nobody cares about]].

*Partyvan bawks - *Hooks up to fone* SNAP NIGRA! I smell teh [[FBI]]!!! RUN!!!![[Oneoneone|ONEONEONE]].

*[[4chan]] bawks - Makes the phone smell liek pharts.

==DUR [[Engineer]]s = [[Winnar]]==
After [[atleast 100]] years of phreaks in her proverbial [[cunt|vajayjay]], Ma Bell finally douched. This involved having [[engineer]]s dream up some way to screw over all the phreakz. They settled on installing T1 lines, which use signals that midget flatus cannot reproduce, ending most phreaking.

Phreaks then began [[hacker|hacking]] [[computer]]s, becoming full time fappers or becoming level five [[Basement Dweller]]s.
