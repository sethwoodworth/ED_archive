{{GreatestHits}}

You are a skilled reader and decipherer of the various wikis that are found on the Internet. You are an advocate of the trolling and the drama and the edit-play that occurs. You are familiar with Encyclopedia Dramatica’s very own [[Wikipedia Porn]] page and you are a big fan of it. All these things are true, but what you didn’t know, is that there is a side of Wikipedia that tries to be valid…however it is stranger than the fiction that people proclaim Wikipedia is guilty of.

It is common knowledge that Wikipedia is a hive of homosexuals, [[Jews|pedophiles, criminals, liars]], and people who like to self-aggrandize online for their own betterment. This article is not about those hobbyists, but rather about the multitude of suckers who have been connived into working for that wiki, without pay, and yet still are moronic enough to get things terribly, no...tragically wrong.

==Categories==
There are a number of places where the average bone-headed Wikipedian will make his or her mark upon that wiki. These places involve expertise in subjects like terminology, grammar, imagery, and moderation. Also, whole sections of that massive wiki are full of writing that lacks any sort of style, impartial opinion, or drama. This article wishes to point out, through items directly quoted from Wikipedia, the massive hilarity that a person can achieve just by reading an online encyclopedia.
The following categories shall be examined at length:

*'''Sexuality''' – Because of the massive disparity that goes on when Wikipedians try to talk about this taboo subject which they know absolutely nothing about.

*'''Diseases''' – Because it's funny to laugh at people who are hurting…and Wikipedia tries to keep a straight face.

*'''Body Modification and Wounds''' – Hey, Encyclopedia Dramatica would be remiss in this subject if they were to leave out the gore and the morons who like to flesh pull.

*'''Racism''' – Since there are no black people on the Internet, it is okay to make articles that are completely idiotic in their scope. Don’t worry, if you edit Wikipedia, nobody pays attention to you anyways.

*'''Politics''' – Yes, we know you hated Bush, now get on with your life.

These categories are by no means extensive or complete, as both wikis grow, so should the content of this article and the series that shall surely follow it. It is only by your watchful eye and  your sarcastic, yet hateful wit that this sort of thing can be allowed to survive.
