"''Vote for that nice [[David Cameron]]. Look at him, he's standing next to a fucking tree and everything, for fuck's sake!''" - The new caring, eco-friendly Tory Party

'''Tories''' are like those crappy rich [[white people|white]] pieces of shit who go to country clubs and drink martinis if they pretended they understood classical English literature and had the disorganization of the [[faggot|Unitarians]]. They love to steal from the poor and stop schools giving milk to children.

<strike>Now that they are out of power</strike> Derp elections, they do not actually do anything except criticise the Labour government for stealing from the poor and having other policies the same as them. [[David Cameron]] is the current leader, and is restyling the party with a more [[communist|centrist]] and [[gay|environmentalist]] approach, while still maintaining a general loathing of [[gays]], [[Muslims|immigrants]], and sound economic policy. You can [[troll|help]] the tory party by following the marked link below.

==Tory Policies==
Better than Labour and Lib Dems, including:
* No lulz
* No [[Fat Larry's Band|music diversification]]
* No [[Jews]]
* No [[fags]]
* No [[Islam|terrorism]]
* No [[Niggers]]
* No [[Mexico|foreigners]]
* Whites or gtfo.

To be blunt, there is only one result from a tory win: [[Fail]]

==How the Tories would run the BBC==

[[File:IR3 SURVIVOR.jpg|thumb|500px|center|Typical Tory ranting on the BBC webpages after an interview with [[Gordon Brown]]. Note the new badly spelled question every 1-2 minutes. Could this by Blackberry from [[David Cameron]]'s office? Clue - '''IR35''' is a Tax form entitled "Working through an intermediary, such as a Personal Service Company."]]
