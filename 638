[[obvious|As we all know]], the internet is full of all manners of [[lol-cow|troll bait]]. These range to but aren't limited to [[retard|idiots]], [[furry|furfags]], [[internet tough guys|internet tough guys]], [[attention whore|those who are desperate for attention]], and just plain old [[faggot|faggots]] in general. But what happens when you combine all of these into one? [[No girls on the internet|Ladies]] and [[gentlemen|gents]], you get Asher2500. Odds are he wouldn't even have this page were it not for his massive [[butthurt|bitch fit]] over the use of the picture on the left.


== The good, the bad and the furfag ==
[[File:Dawgballs.jpg|thumb|right|[[sick fuck|I LOOK AT DOG BALLS ALL THE TIME]]!]]
Asher is a [[Narutard]],[[wigger|gangsta]], [[faggot|fudge packing]] [[bakedfurs|Mary Jane smoking furfag]] that thinks [[lolcats]] and [[YTMD]] are the [[fucktard|funniest fucking thing on the planet.]] He scuttles around the state of Oregon, giving blowjobs for cash so he can go to Canada. He even [[unwarranted self importance|wrote a wikifur article about himself]]! When he was a child, he had [[incest|problems with his father]] so he moved out to [[pussy|live with his mommy]]. Eventually she got sick of his shit(who wouldn't?) and told him to [[gtfo|GTFO]], which ended up [[haha|causing him to get kicked out of high school]]. At one point, he lived in a house [[mantrain|with three other furfags]] including his ex, [[weeaboo|kazumafox]]. [[DO NOT WANT|YIFF YIFF YIFF~<3]]. He brags about having an unhealthy obsession with his [[Xbox|Xbawx]] [[hypocrite|yet constantly tells everyone to get a life]]. Asher claims he has [[disorder|anxiety, OCD and insomnia]] but everyone knows he's just looking for a reason to smoke pot all day and yiff with his buddies. I mean, [[no one|who wouldn't want to do that?]] He's known on FA for spending a shit ton of money on drawings of [[beastiality|dog cocks]], [[typical|writing emo "poetry"]], spamming and failing at old memes, and [[baw|ranting]] about how he's much more mature than whoever just called him out on being a total fucktard. He was even banned for screaming his ass off once and was blocked from seeing [[furry art| furry porn]] for a while due to the fact he was [[underageb&|17]] at the time. He claims to hate people who [[RP]] with a passion yet [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1576556/ boasts about starting a relationship with a woman in canada through roleplaying.]

As of late, Asher has revealed that he had been cheating on his fat fuck of a boyfriend for months with some [[canadian|canuck]] furfag....[[stupid|and then thought he could play the role of the victim]]. [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1481288/ In a lulzy turn of events], Kazumafox got drunk off his ass and tried to fuck up Asher with some weeaboo [[cock|sword]] after trying to punch holes in the walls and talking shit about him. [[lulz|He leaves but promptly returns with a bowie knife]] and threatens Asher several times [[fail|before leaving like a little bitch]]. Asher [[wambulance|cries]] and goes on to talk about [[Shit no one cares about|his big wuff in shining armor]] and some shit about flying to [[canada|milkbagland]] with a fire cracker up his ass. To this day, he still writes journals [[no life|every three hours]] about how he jacked off to his canadian girlfriend or how Kazuma keeps beating his ass and breaking his shit. Don't forget the obligitory [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1593783/|"GIVE ME ATTENTION],[[no friends| I HAS NOE FRIENZ!!"]] journals.

== ED Drama ==
[[File:Notrollg.JPG|thumb|center|700px|[[Asking for it]].]]
Travel back to [[last thursday|June 6, 2010]]. All is well in the land of furfags. [[youtube poop|The birds were singing]], the foxes were yiffing and every thing was [[gay|peaceful and quiet]]. That is, until one Asher2500 make a shocking dicovery. [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|Someone]] was making fun of him on the internet. He finally found out that [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Asherfag.jpg this fugly picture of him] had been up on the [[Furaffinity|FA]] article for [[slowpoke|MONTHS]]. Asher, being the [[fucktard]] he is, decided to remove the picture from the article and declare victory. However, the changes he made were quickly undone by one ED's caretakers. [[rage|Pent up with fury]] after seeing the image resurface onto the page, he removed it again. Then [[User_talk:Keiffox|after being told several times to stop vandalizing the article]], he continued removing the photo only to have his edits quickly reverted. Then, he was promptly told to get in IRC if he wanted it to be pulled so badly. [[facepalm|He said no]]. After an hour long edit war, a sysop got sick of his shit and smacked his ass with the [[ban|ban hammer]]. This could have all ended here but he decided to [[Bigger Man Argument|be the bigger man]] by posting a butthurt journal on FA about how [[lie|he doesn't care]], that [[truth|we're all basement dwellers]] and [[pwned|how his mom got him kicked out of high school]]. Afterwards, he went after a troll/ED user that was on FA; posting many threats [[internet tough guy|of violence]], beatings with the [[ban|unrealistic expectations]] and [[lolsuit|lolsuits]]. However, because of the fact he was trolled on ED instead of Furaffinity, [[fail|the mods couldn't ban anyone]]. [[Irony|Ironically]], by posting those threats, Asher violated the TOS. [[Epic fail|And got his ass chewed out by the mods for harassment]]. It's a really bad sign when a [[ALL CAPS|TROLL USES THE ADMINS TO TROLL YOU]]. After dealing with the shocking realization that the mods don't give a shit about him, he posted [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1456537/ another journal], this time about how the mods [[NYPA|didn't care about his "furry brotherhood" mentality]] and that he's still much more mature than everyone. He now claims that [[lie|he did this all to get a page written about him]] and [[bullshit|that he doesn't care about it]], yet [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1551013/ he] [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Fuckthatkidropii.jpg keeps] [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Asherup.jpg bringing] [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Ash1er.jpg it up.] 


[http://www.furaffinity.net/view/4222286| He even wrote a nice little rap about us.] [[Lie|'''HE REALLY DOESN'T FUCKING CARE YOU GUYS!!!!11!1!
''']]


===He only really wanted an article!===

[[image:Iwasplayingthewholetimeguise.png|thumb|center|800px|[[Disregard that]], I just want you to think I don't give a shit.]]



The fact that Asher and his friends like to [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Asher2500&diff=1998500217&oldid=1998498522 vandalize this article by changing some of the words so they aren't so zomg mean] and breaking the wikimarkup in process - they can't even get it right if it's done for them, and even more, was done over a period of four hours. Shit like this makes the entire statement void.

== Hacked or Attention Whoring? You decide. ==
{{Notice|This section is incomplete. A certain faggot is to finish it later. }} 



On August 22, 2010, Asher and Kazumafox were apparently hacked. [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1654593/ Two] [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1654612/ journals] announcing that both accounts were under someone else's control were posted. The writer of said journals identified himself as [[Anonymous|Mr Anonymous]] and proceeded to wipe both of their galleries clean. Both accounts were apparently recovered within the next few hours and their gay furry porn was re-uploaded. However, there are a few things that [[ORLY|REALLY don't fall into place]] and suggest this as blatent attention whoring from at least one of the furfags.
