Diablo II
[[Image:boxart.gif|thumb|Neat box art!]]
The sequel to ''[[Shit nobody cares about|Diablo]]''. It exists solely to give people a reason to spend years of their lives clicking their left mouse button.  '''''Diablo II''''' players, much like ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' [[virgin|nerd]]s, waste the best years of their lives online, talking about useless garbage and often subscribing to many [[forums]]. One major difference between ''Diablo II'' nerds and WoW nerds is ''Diablo II'' nerds aren't stupid enough to pay $15 a month for a shitty game.

==Player Characters==

There are several characters you can play as in what [[fag|experienced players]] would call D2. For new players, here are the summaries of the types of characters to help make the game [[moar]] [[pedophilia|fun]]!

===[[Necrophilia|Necromancer]]===
The necromancer summons [[cock|bones]] to fight for him. Doing so online will result in massive BAWWWing from other players whose computers and "two soup cans and a string" internet connections can't handle more than two of your skeletons on-screen at a time. So, Necromancers become a shitty support character who are only good for cursing monsters and getting the shit beaten out of them.

===[[Tranny|Amazon]][[amazon|.com]]===
This [[Woman|female]] character is ideally a ranged combatant, using [[steroids|bows]] and [[Cock|javelins]]. Is more buff than [[You|you'll]] ever be and has an even bigger dick, and as such, is frequently [[fapped|masturbated]] to by [[basement dwellers]], [[weeaboos]] and [[gooks]].

===[[Leeroy Jenkins|Paladin]]===
The obligatory [[Negro|African American]] [[lolwut|Christian]] added by game developers to give players the option of +1 to stealing bicycles.  Just like real African Americans, the Paladin adorns himself with large flashy crosses, excels at killing others and stealing your gold.

===[[Ninja|Assassin]]===
Some [[Jewish]]-looking cunt who bought some [[BDSM]] gear and goes around [[ohbutyouwillpet|raping babies]] and acting like a [[azn|ninja]]. Being the only actual adult female character, most of her skills are bound to making sandwiches and giving [[Fellatio|Blow-Jays.]]

===[[Furry|Druid]]===
Similar to the Necromancer, in that he lives in his mom's basement. What separates is [[fur affinity]], and [[yiff|yiffing]]

===[[Harry Potter|Sorceress]]===
A [[16 year old girl]] who used her [[Wicca|magical powers]] to pwn stuff. Is a completely shit character, as everything is immune to her spells and is of no use except for [[whore|sex]]. Nobody plays the sorceress, not even Jew

===[[300|Barbarian]]===
A [[Typical|fat, American]] football player. Most new players pick this character because they assume he is the most powerful, [[IRL|but in reality]] the game sucks and they need to [[get a life|go outside]].

==Multiplayer Gameplay==
[[Image:SCHEF2.jpg|thumb|The Official ''Diablo II'' Gold Elite Darklord Dragonslayer Manual in its entirety]]
Everyone plays online, if you don't you are obviously poor and black. The main advantage to playing online is the ability to [[The internet|trade items with other players]]. Below is a typical conversation between two D2-ers wishing to engage each other in a trade:

 Player #1: wug
 Player #2: wuw
 Player #1: wug
 Player #2: wuw
 Player #1: wug
 Player #2: wuw
 Player #1: wug
 Player #2: wuw
 Player #1: wug
 Player #2: wuw
 Player #1: [[User:Smokecrackintomordor|One does not simply smoke crack into Mordor...]]

This usually goes on for [[over 9000]] hours until the players' moms call them to dinner.

===Pvm Noobs===
The pvm players are mostly those who are playing on "ladder" and who are "mfing" (short for Magic-Finding, [[fun|The action of searching for items by wasting hours and hours, killing the same bosses again and again]]) and playing "PvM" (Player vs Monster).

===Scams===

[[Image:Diablo_II_Bot_Edition.jpg|thumb|right|Typical Diablo II gameplay]] 

'''''UP-FUCKING-DATE!!!:'''''
A recent Harvard study shows that 97% of the people who play ''Diablo II'' are just trying to rape you. 

They can ruin weeks, months, even [[loser|years worth of work]] for [[I did it for the lulz|their own personal gain]]. They [[I go chop your dollar|go chop yo ''Diablo II'' dollar]]. If they get you, you <S>fall [[mugu]] and go on Baal runs for the master</s> are a [[fucktard]]. [[Naruto|BELIEVE IT!]]

[[bawwwww|These are usually children aged 5-12 who live in their parent's attic, or basement who have nothing better to do, have no friends, don't go to school for some odd reason, and stay home randomly sending people computer-ruining viruses, for no reason. Sending out spam e-mails, and restlessly trying to hack peoples computer to steal their identities, or their bank account numbers, permanently destroying a lifetimes worth of work. Because of their age, their brains do not function at the same level of maturity and morals as that of an adult. Therefore, they are prone to doing irrational and damaging things. These children lose their virginity the very moment they are physically and biologically capable of having sex, usually at 10-12 years old. Also, they do lots of drugs at age 5, join "kid gangs", commit crimes (especially financial crimes online), all before bedtime!]]

TL;DR: FUCKING [[AZN]]s.

===Nazis===
The Diablo Nazis are those hardcore players who've wasted 2-3 years or more on that moronic [[Hitler]] [[AZN|Chinkey]] Jew game and still play it because they think it's better than sex. They keep calling people "randoms" when they simply suggested to go on [[spam|yet another Baal run]], and waste more hours on the ''Diablo II'' related forums than on the game itself.

===Juggalos===
[[Image:icp_diablo.jpg|thumb|right|A [[dude|player]] doing it for the [[lulz]].]] There are [[at least 100|a lot of]] [[juggalos]] on ''Diablo'' at any given time. 

How to piss off Juggalos:
*Make a game called "juggalos" or something close
*As soon as they join, hostile them
*No matter what level they are, they will attempt to "represent, fool"
*[[Lulz]] ensue, see picture
*[[????]]
*PROFIT

===Open B.net===
In the depths of Battle.net, is a mode called Open Battle.net, which allows you to use your single player character that is not saved in the Battle.net client. What this allows, is for players to open their character file with Hax0rs and make their toon WTFPWN everything within a radius of your toon. Some editors will allow you to add items and runes that remain constantly active, and even add spells that were not there before. The best part, is [[BAWWW|people actually complain]] when you go onto open b.net with a [[Retard|modded]] character.

'''Things to do in Open B.net:'''
*Walk around with aura runes, setting all to hostile and commiting rape whilst standing in one place.
*Set your characters level with as many 9's as possible, this will make you stronger.
*Tell others that your hacking b.net when they ask about your character.
*Follow others that are actually trying to play DII in a open b.net game ( Wtf.. ).
