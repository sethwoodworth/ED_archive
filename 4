''''''Missing White Woman' Syndrome''''' is a horrible affliction suffered by [[old media]]. Whenever a stupid [[White people|white woman]] [[gb2kitchen|goes missing]] the [[media]] makes sure everybody knows about it and make it the [[lulz|story]] of the week. Unfortunately, most missing white women are found alive and in good health.

However, if anyone [[ugly|unattractive]], male, or of black person goes missing the [[media]] doesn't care at all. It is nearly impossible to get any [[television]] coverage for any of these people no matter what social class they come from. [[Some argue]] this is because [[women]] and [[white people]] are just plain better than everyone else, a [[fact]] which has yet to be disproven.  Others believe that nobody notices missing black person [[Whore|ho's]] and [[Mexico|wetbacks]] simply because their absence has no negative consequences, due to the [[Truth|fact]] that they didn't contribute to society in the first place.

Still others argue that the term was made up by [[Wikipedia]], as a result of them having [[wikipedia:Missing white woman syndrome|a long-standing article on it]]. However, it should be noted that this article has [[Over 9000|3]][[Rule 34|4]] [[Citation needed|external citations]].

Using the expression "Missing White Woman Syndrome" is a good way to instantly establish oneself as [[unwarranted self importance|media savvy]].  If someone points out that the "woman" in question was actually a one year baby, cut them down by pointing out, with a knowing look, that if the baby were black everyone would just assume she was a [[crack]] [[whore]] who had been [[asking for it]].
