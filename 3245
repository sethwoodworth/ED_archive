{{potential}}

''Gary Yourofsky'', ex-[[PETA]] employee and convicted felon, is considered one of the most dangerous criminal activists of the present age.  Though he has on numerous occasions denied his affiliation with PETA, he continues his role traveling to various schools, churches, and college campuses around the United States in hopes of "converting" [[16-year-old girl|young freethinking individuals]] to the [[vegan]] cause.


==Methods==
Instead of appealing to his audiences' sense of reason, Yourofsky prefers the [[brute force]] approach; using outlandish, borderline illegal statements and hoarding propaganda to shock others into supporting his beliefs.  The typical presentation has Yourofsky first condemning his audience for consuming [[animal|animal products]], calling them "[[devil|the devil]]" for participating in their practices.  If this doesn't succeed at grabbing attention, Yourofsky then skillfully moves into his visual segment of the program, which consists of a 3-4 minute long web video (which he claims he shot with his own eye in Detroit) of slaughterhouse footage set to Christian music.  What Yourofsky casually forgets to mention to his audience is that the slaughterhouse footage was filmed in Chihuahua, [[Mexico]] and has been floating around [[internet|the internet]] for several years.  As the audience is softened up by this point, Yourofsky ends with shoving [[cock|unsubstantiated facts]] about animal testing and slaughterhouses into the heads of his captive audience, which allows him to quickly transition into his unpaid soy endorsements for Boca Burgers.  On some occasions, Yourofsky follows up his presentation with a question and answer session, where more of the former is created and none of the latter is revealed.  Citing false texts of the bible, quotes from [[Nazi]] sympathizers, and rehashed PETA propaganda, Yourofsky time and time dodges his audiences' bullets.  In the rare event that an audience member might stand up to Yourofsky or find loopholes in his broken logic, Yourofsky falls back on common insults and avoidance tactics that have made him so elusive in conversation.


Currently, Yourofsky travels the nation in a vehicle that his mother donated to his cause whilst managing his own animal rights group.  ADAPTT, which sustains little more than a PETA offshoot group, has a website where those who fall for Yourofsky's inflammatory speech can visit to keep up with his recent trips and future events.


==Background Information==
According to Yourofsky, the species vigilantism began back in his early twenties, when his step-father invited him and a few friends to his circus.  Backstage, Yourofsky became privy to the sight of a line of chained elephants swinging their bodies neurotically because, according to Yourofsky, they had been beaten consistently into submission.  From that point on, he, without a job or much education, dedicated his life to the "protection" of animals. His fierce veganism did not begin until some time later when Yourofsky called into a local radio station protesting against the local hockey team's long-standing tradition.  Reportedly, the deejay called Yourofsky out on his apparent non-compliance with a vegetarian diet, at which point Yourofsky lied about his previous night's dinner.  In order to live the lie, Yourofsky claims he cut all animal products from his diet from that point forward.

==Gary Yourofsky Quotes:==

*(on working for PETA) An offer from Newkirk was "like getting a call from the Godfather's Don Corleone," wrote Yourofsky. "It's an offer one can't refuse." 

*(after being fired from PETA) "PETA has turned itself into a corporation like the environmental corporation that Greenpeace has become, '''and the civil rights corporation that is the NAACP. All three groups used to be hungry for progress, and used to demand change, and never back down nor compromise. However, they all decided along the way to focus their crosshairs on wallets and purses instead of scumbags who commit injustice.'''"

*"Gurdjieff, the Great Russian Seeker of Truth, explained that life is the payment of promissory notes one makes while in a waking sleep. He said that humans spend the majority of life going through the motions, making promises (marriage, employment) they never intended nor wanted, and then suffering from the burden of fulfilling those unintended commitments. Commitments to our jobs, our homes, to our spouses and family members are ignoble. The only commitment should be to justice by any means necessary. "

*"The USA defines the word imperialism. GW Bush commits evil acts, such as lying and murdering, on a daily basis. But what's even scarier than Bushâ€™s iniquity is that 58,000,000 Americans voted him into office! Sometimes I am not sure if I am more embarrassed to be human or more embarrassed to be an American. Americans have been turned into walking zombies via religion, government, schools and the media. Buy this product or go to this university and you'll be happy. Wear this cologne and you'll get laid. Eat these dead animals and you'll be a man. Believe in this invisible being in the sky, and you'll go to a pretty place after you die. Sometimes I think that the only effective and productive method of destroying speciesism would be for each uncaring human to be forced to live the life of a cow on a feedlot, or a monkey in a laboratory, or an elephant in the circus, or a bull in a rodeo, or a mink on a fur farm. Then people would be awakened from their soporific states and finally understand the horrors that are inflicted on the animal kingdom by the vilest species to ever roam this planet: the human animal!"

*"Deep down, I truly hope that oppression, torture and murder return to each uncaring human tenfold! '''I hope that fathers accidentally shoot their sons on hunting excursions, while carnivores suffer heart attacks that kill them slowly. Every women ensconced in fur should endure a rape so vicious that it scars them forever. While every man entrenched in fur should suffer an anal raping so horrific that they become disembowelled. Every rodeo cowboy and matador should be gored to death, while circus abusers are trampled by elephants and mauled by tigers. And, lastly, may irony shine its esoteric head in the form of animal researchers catching debilitating diseases and painfully withering away because research dollars that could have been used to treat them was wasted on the barbaric, unscientific practice of vivisection.'''"

*"However, when education and civil disobedience and protests do not work, actions have to be stepped up."

*"Since the majority of people are close-minded, rude, incoherent, incognizant and [[BAWWWWW|just plain mean]], and since logic and compassion can not solely deprogram and educate the masses, it is time to resort to powerful tactics that make them understand."

*"It's not about loving animals. It's about fighting injustice. My whole goal is for humans to have as little contact as possible with animals."

*'''"Do not be afraid to condone arsons at places of animal torture." And if an "animal abuser" should die as the result of a research lab arson, "I would unequivocally support that, too."'''

*"If there's one thing I've learned in six years of intense activism, it's that all hunters, vivisectionists, circus trainers, furriers, trappers, rodeo cowboys and factory farmers are cowards who never fight those who fight back."

*(on animal testers) They "are sick, sadistic power-mongers who enjoy murdering animals in gas chambers."

*(on a.t.) These "murdering scum should be put on trial for depraved, nefarious and inhuman acts of terrorism against the animal kingdom."

*(on a.t.) This is done not to contribute to the health of humans and other animals but to "satisfy the macabre and depraved minds" of the researchers.

*"I would unequivocally support" murder in order to further animal rights aims.

*"Heck, I don't even agree with myself sometimes!"

*"I am available for private classroom presentations, and will do as many lectures as I can arrange in a one or two-day period. '''I am not interested, though, in any OPEN TO THE PUBLIC talks unless you can guarantee an audience of at least 15-25 meat-eaters.''' I despise preaching to the choir."

*"Sorry I didn't post this last week, but The American Red Cross engages in the terroristic, murderous and unscientific practice of vivisection."

*"Donations to ADAPTT, however, are not tax-deductible because of government harassment. In 2000 the IRS stripped ADAPTT of its (c) 3 status because of our involvement in and support of civil disobedience and [[Murder|direct action]]. But don't let the government scare your donations away and destroy the most effective form of activism this movement has ever known." (There's a big difference between [[Gandhi|non-violent resistance]] and arson, Gary.)

FYI, "vivisection" is just a fancy way of saying "surgery". TEH MOAR YOU KNOW!
