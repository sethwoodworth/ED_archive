'''Planeshift''', ''PlainShit'', is another [[free|gay]] [[MMORPG]]. It is [[client]]-based created by some [[noob]] that has a whole team of [[slaves|failures]] to do all of his [[shit]] for him. He gets all the credit for the entire fucking game. [[The game]] updates once every century or so. Special features include [[error|errors]], disconnections, lag, [[herpes]], shit graphics, freezing, random crashes, long waits at every loading screen, [[frustration]], and no help from the GMs, who would rather be [[fap|fapping]] and running around the roleplay server looking for hawt cyborz.


__TOC__


==PlaneShift's Staff==

PlaneShift has a bunch of [[random]]-ass staff members, all too self-centered to give a damn about the game. If you are desperate enough to play the game, you will surely run into a couple of [[fag|staff]] members including Tuxide who was supposedly [[permabanned]] for pissing off the 'creator' for not having [[buttsex]] with him. The game's creator is Talad, [[USI|which is also a name of a god in the lore]]. Nobody cares about the rest of the staff.

== Population ==

So if you even bother playing the game for more than five minutes, you'll meet some of the most [[retard|retarded]] people in the universe in game. On SkyLab, it's [[furries]] and serious RPers who just want to have hawt lesbian secks with your character. On EZPC, you'll meet 3 to 4 people. The [[USI|self-appointed "leader"]] of this server is some douche named Vvallace Stormsbane.


==IRC==

PlaneShift has '[[secret]]' [[IRC]] channels where staff members roleplay sucking each other off. If you are unfortunate enough to join any of the channels, you'll find they'll not care if you watch their shameless [[gay|porn]]. If you try to [[troll]] the staff members they will befriend you so fast you won't realize their [[dick]]s are in your ass.

Said secret channels include #planeshift-devs, #planeshift-settings and #planeshift-prospects on [[freenode]]. Join the latter and pretend to be a "prospect" for fun times.

== Registering ==

Creating an account on SkyLab:
{{quote|Please note that this server is a Roleplay server. This means that players should impersonate their characters as if living in medieval times, can use only fantasy names, cannot refer to contemporary names/facts/events/items. The game experience will be a lot more immersive, but you are more restricted on saying and doing what you want.''|In other words, don't do anything creative or we'll [[Banhammer|ban]] you.}}

It is common to see at least 50 gays frolicking about this server trying to speak in an accent. They are so serious about their roleplaying that they write 5 paragraphs a post. You have to wait at least ten minutes for them to finish typing. If you want to give the server a shot even though you aren't into roleplaying, then be warned: within a few minutes in game, your character will be tracked down by a roleplayfag who will rape you in the ears with "Good day sir. Care to join me for some buttsex?" The best thing to do is to run...fast. 

Creating an account on Ezpcusa:
{{quote|Please note that this server is a Non Roleplay server. This means that players are not required to impersonate their characters, can use any name (as long as it's not offensive), can refer to contemporary names/facts/events/items. The game experience can be less immersive, but you are more free to say and do what you want.''|We don't care about you since you don't want to be a fag like the rest of us.}}

Since PlainShit is so full of fail, don't even bother playing it by joining the Ezpcusa server is NOT A GOOD CHOICE. Srsly, four persons online on one server. You're better off playing games alone. If you are a determined individual, head for the SkyLab server and troll the shit out of the furfags and wannabe DnD nerds.

== Downloading the game ==

Now that you've registered for a server, it's time to download the game. If you've managed to find your way, there's not only a [[Windows]] download section but a [[Linux]] section and a [[Mac|Mac OSX]] section as well. If you're a gamer, you obviously use Windows. Out of all the download mirrors for Windows, only one works. If you're not pissed off from going through all the mirrors, then you will be when you realize it takes over an hour to download the game.

== Creating a character ==

<s>PlainShit has a very annoying system in place to help you create your character. There are 12 avatars you can choose from. Basically an anthro cat (for furries), a rockman/woman, an elf, a fish man with wings, a devil man, a fish woman, and dwarves. Not all of these have female or male avatars so you're stuck with choosing from 3. 12 avatars was a lie. This part is so unorganized that you spend 5 minutes trying to figure out how to change your character's gender, which is inconveniently placed at the top. You have to chose a first and last name for your character which takes some thinking. Then you have to come up with a bunch of other information using 150 points they give you. Whatever you chose creates your stats. The stats are mostly crap anyway. After that you've created your character. That only took 1 hour right? Fucking lame.</s>

You'd have to be retarded to have difficulty creating a character. Pick a race, randomize fucking everything, tweaking a bit if you end up with too many or two little [[CP|Creation Points]] at the end, or use the "Quick Creation" method. It really doesn't matter what species you decide to play, seeing as if you're joining the game because of this article, you're clearly only there to troll.

== The tutorial ==

Once you log in with your new character you are taken to the tutorial. It's simple enough, just read shit and click the correct dialogue in the box that pops up.

== Playing the game ==

You've finally made it with your character to the desired sever after blowing half your day getting this far. Fanfuckingtastic. You'll spawn in Hydlaa, near the forge. Basically all you can do is quests, unless you want to duel or cyber with other players if you can find them. The NPCs talk in long paragraphs and give you the most random ass quests. If you're on the SkyLab server, be prepared to be violently ass raped. If you're on EZPC, be prepared to watch two people spam the gossip channel.

== Quests ==

If you're not turned off by this sugar-coated shit pile they call a game by now, you will be when you attempt any of the so-called quests. Every quest in this game involves going somewhere 50 pixel miles away which takes you an hour to get to (WITH NO MAP OR TELEPORTS) and then going back. The NPC's talk you to death and don't even make sense half the time. Let's not forget to mention that if you even try asking anyone for help, they will try to lure you into a room at the tavern instead of actually helping you play.


There are certain quests you can do to get mounts, which are the only way to get places fast. One of them is a retarded horsegoat. The other is something that looks like an inbred [[stingray]]. Both mounts have the exact same speed, and have no real difference other than being on different levels of ugly. Not to mention both of them lag you out the ass whenever you try using them, thus defeating the purpose of having a mount in the first place.

== <s>Glitches</s> Features ==

*Mounts
If you don't want to [[BAWW|waste half your fucking day walking around a fucktasticly huge map for one quest]], you will be tempted to get a mount. To do this you must run all the way back and forth across what's implemented of the entire land. 

There are two options you can pick from to get a mount: do a shitload of quests to be "[[gay|good]]" or do a [[asian|small]] amount of quests to be [[BAMF|bad]]. If you are a lazy ass on the EZPC server you will pick the easy road and then after a month you realize that you can't get into the last quest area for the mount because the PlaneShift staff is too fucking lazy to fix the glitch. [[Nerd_Rage|Screw you PlaneShift.]] 

[[BAWW|The other way allowed you to get the mount, but then it disappeared because of a glitch so you spent 2 months for nothing. Oh but let's not forget that while the EZPC poor souls waited forever for working mounts, the rpfags on the other server had mounts working for a long time. After much bitching from the EZPC server users, the staff got their shit together and fixed the mount glitch.]]

*Graphics
The default setting for the client has graphics at a high quality. If your computer is even moderately slow, then you are out of fucking luck. What's better is that the game's graphics randomly glitch giving you almost permanant blinding light, [[gay|rainbow shapes]], missing avatar heads, deformed avatars/mounts, and more cumspews of crap that make you want to throw your computer out.

*Lag
Whether you're questing or [[roleplaying|having wonderful furry sex]], PlainShit is just one large shit pile of lag. Even turning down graphics and assorted other things in the options menu doesn't help to tame the horrid lag. It's probably the worst when you're trying to train. Say you're trying to train your strength. To train said stat, you have to kill hundreds of the inbred, retarded, hillbilly monsters after paying half of the money you have to buy the skill in the first place. While trying to level up your skill, you lag. As you continue training a skill, the lag gets worse. When you're so close to leveling up a skill that you can smell the sweet aroma wafting from your computer screen, you have to reconnect in order to actually be able to continue playing without lag [[Cunnilingus|eating you out.]]

== Trolling ==
Trolling PlainShit players is [[Lie|often fun]] and can result in great lulz for you and epic fail for the staff.

*Trolling [[Jews|staff]]
All staff members lead an [[fail|online relationship]], [[no exceptions]]. Furthermore, their characters are either [[furries]] or genderless statues which can mysteriously engage in [[cybersex]]. In real life, they are little more than wannabe teachers on online colleges, such as [[HARPOONS|Rizin]] and <s>Xillix</s> Disregard that, XilliX got himself fired for refusing Talad his daily buttsex. Talad, the lead developer, is nothing more than a retard who fails to play the game according to his own rules.

Also, all PlainShit staff members participate in so called "GM Events" where they act out a story on the SkyLab sever. Lulz is generated by accusing them of bad roleplay or simply convincing players not to follow their plot, which results in massive [[b&]] and fail.

Furthermore, tell the staff that Enkidukai are cats and play your Enkidukai like a cat-person to make the staff rage. Or do the same with Klyros, claiming that they're dragons, Kran as animate rocks, Groffels as griffins, Diaboli as [[Satan]], et cetera. 

In fact, play any race and put the word "dragon" somewhere in their description. And go on the forums demanding dragons be put in-game.

*Trolling [[fag|roleplayers]]
Tell them they fail at life by spending their time [[cybersex|playing]] their [[Mary Sue]] characters. For lulz throw shit at the [[furry|"Royal House of Purrty"]] and watch how the fags rush to the defense of their [[slut|"queen"]], since all roleplayers are in for the [[drama]]. The majority of those can also be trolled by offending their characters, since they don't realise it is a fucking game. This is extra fun, since staff can do a shit about that, just say "It was purely in character".

Play a prostitute and, once you have the other character someplace quiet in group, have your female character whip their dick out, or ask your partner to do [[Two_girls_one_cup|horrible]], [[Roman_Showers|unspeakable]] [[Babyfuck|acts]] with you. This will undoubtedly result in [[b&]], but the reactions will be great. If you decide to do this, please take screenshots and post them here.

*Trolling "normal" players
Easy as raping a baby. Jump right into their characters all the time or tell them how weak and sucky they are. This results in spamming duel invitations from their part, simply declining those results in b& for them. Also, always attack the NPCs they are fighting.

For classy lulz convince them you are a staff member, make them give you all their stuff and them have them become [[an hero]]. This actually works.

*Hacking
You can hack the game with your [[CSIII]] skills. No, srsly. A memory editor is enough to give you infinite money. If you truly have no life, modify the source files for teleportation etc.
Note that the cheated money makes everyone obey your commands, great for trolling [[13 year old boys|everyone on this game]]. 

Staff usually tells people to report themselves after a new bug/hack becomes public, for [[Lie|they've got logs]].
