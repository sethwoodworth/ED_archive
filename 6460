The '''Sony Playstation''' was Sony's first attempt at a game console, and unlike apple, they somehow managed to do it right, even  without needing an [[Halo|overrated FPS]] to save it's ass in the first round like [[Microsoft]] did. It was a 32-bit console. [[basement dwellers|"Hardcore"]] gamers often whine and complain that this console was the first game console that made video games mainstream, and turned the industry into the train wreck it is today. Sadly, they are probably right. Sony made this thing through trial and error, and massive amounts of [[butthurt]] and [[drama]] between [[Nintendo]] and [[Sony]].

There was also that [[Sega|other]] console, but nobody gave a shit. 

==History==
Did you know that the original concept for the '''Sony Playstation''' was conceived in 1986? Back in the day, [[Sony]] and [[Nintendo]] were working on an [[SNES]] version of the Sega CD called the SNES-CD. But then [[Nintendo]] got [[butthurt]] over the contract details and delivered a blow to [[Sony]]'s balls by abruptly signing a deal with Phillips and disbanding the whole project. Pissed off, [[Sony]] flipped them the middle finger and started working on a CD based console that could also play [[SNES]] games. [[Nintendo]], [[I see what you did there|seeing what they did there]], filed a lawsuit. Eventually they agreed to do this, but Nintendo would get most of the profit. Probably having enough with Nintendo, they decided in 1993 to rework the system for the next gen, and thus the '''Sony Playstation''' was born. Eventually the '''Playstation''' became a success, and formed a following of people all over the world. Of coarse, this was before [[Sony]]'s [[Sony Defense Force|god awful fanbase]] started to form.

==Crash Bandicoot==

This was the Mid 90's, and as we know, every video game company had their own retarded mascot back then. Sony however, was lacking in one, so they made their mascot a clinically [[insane]] [[furry]] named Crash Bandicoot. This worked out pretty well, because everyone loves furries...well, everyone who hasn't seen the kind who dress up and [[yiff]] that is. Of coarse since [[gooks]] are weird as fuck, Crash Bandicoots physical appearance had to be altered for the [[Japanese]] version to appeal to them, and the intro screens where changed from cool to fucking insane. Of coarse after Crash Bandicoot 3, Sony and Naughty Dog sold him out, and now Crash along with his old [[butt buddy|buddy]] [[Spyro]] is on life support, only by really shitty games that no one wants to play.

==Memorable Games==
[[Image:Jill_Valentine_by_Kazuv.jpg|thumb|The plot of Resident Evil, envisioned by [http://kazuv.deviantart.com Kazuv], an emo faggot who draws nothing but creepy pictures of pregnant chicks]]
Here are some of the more memorable games the PS1 had to offer. Feel free to add any.
* '''[[Metal Gear Solid]]''' - Eh kills robots and doesnt afraid of anything.
* '''[[Castlevania|Castlevania Symphony of the Night]]''' - Bishie albino killing monsters
* '''Dance Dance Revolution''' - Just the thought of this game is a mind fuck, as when you imagine it, you imagine [[basement dwelling]] [[anime]] nerds ACTUALLY EXERCISING on the games dance pad.
* '''[[LSD]]''' - One of the most fucked up games in existance. Everything you touch transports you somewhere, and if you know where to go you can find some very trippy/messed up things.
* '''[[Final Fantasy 7]]''' - Possibly the most overrated video game ever made in all of existence. You play as this emo guy (possibly cloud) who is in some resistance and this chick dies and everyone [[BAWW]]S and they kill this gay looking [[faggot]] named Sephiroth. Shit, I don't know what this fucking games about.
* '''Resident Evil''' - STOP...DON'T O-PEN THAT DOOR!
* '''[[Silent Hill]]''' - HUH.. RADIO. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT RADIO? 
* '''Twisted Metal 2''' - Its like a racing game, except instead of racing, you blow the shit out of the other cars (and the Eifle tower).
* '''Vigilante 8''' - Some Twisted Metal rip off by Activision, same people who made the game below (although was better on the N64).
* '''Tony Hawk's Pro Skater''' - Some skating game that became famous.
* '''Destruction Derby''' - A game where you go around Racing & Crushing other cars at the same time. Also had a [[Nintendo]] 64 Port.
* '''[[Grand Theft Auto]] 1, London & 2''' - [[NEVAR FORGET|HOW COULD WE FORGET?]]
* '''Point Blank 1, 2 & 3''' - Unless if you live under a rock, you know what this game is. [[ALL CAPS|DON'T SHOOT -1 LIFE PENALTY]]
* '''Syphon Filter''' - Like Metal Gear Solid but with [[MOAR]] action.
* '''Medal of Honor: Underground ''' - Or Medal of honor : [[Basement-dweller]]
* '''Parappa the Rapper''' - Play a  [[furry|dog]] made out of paper which raps. Yes, that's it.
* '''Chrono Cross''' - The shitty sequel to [[Chrono Trigger]], that being the only reason why it's on this list.
* '''Suikoden II''' - Yet another [[Final Fantasy XIV|shitty RPG,]] only it's thought of as [[the best]] RPG on the system next to Chrono Cross and <s>the Final Fantasy games</s> Final Fantasy VII, [[Truth|although really they're all the same generic game.]] Another thing notable about Suikoden II is that it's the most expensive game on the system and '''DEFINITELY''' not worth the money.

==The Controller==
There has never been a controller that has evolved over the life span of a console more than the Playstation 1 controller has. The original controller had absolutely no analog stick, which really fucked over 3D games. However, when Super Mario 64 came out and managed to take full control of an analog stick, Sony knew they had to redesign their controller to support analog, or Nintendo would [[rape|get jiggy with them]] in no time. Thus the Sony Dual Analog controller was born. Of coarse, this didn't exactly stop there. Eventually, Sony upgraded the controller once again into the Playstation "dual shock" controller to support the new rumble feature, which was praised for making a game more realistic, and sexier (if you know what I mean you [[sick fuck]]).

==Influence on the Internet==
[[Image:Cloud_fights_Inu_yasha_by_belafantasy.jpg|thumb|Typical nauseating fanart.]]
While the PlayStation's prime lifespan was when the internet was still young and slightly better due to the fact that it hadn't yet become the place where every person on the face of the planet dumped their lives problems on, it did have a horrible wretched backlash of fans who enjoyed it starting somewhere around 2003. We can [[lie|definitely thank]] the PlayStation for all the yaoi, deviant art drawings, and terrible fanfiction of [[Final Fantasy 7]] that we unfortunately run into every day, and we can DEFINITELY thank the PlayStation for the fanbase it built up, and all the [[painful|wonderful]] comments they leave on [[youtube]] supporting the latest PlayStation console. But most of all, we can gratefully thank the Playstation for Sony Defense Force, a band of [[lie|upstanding individuals]], who shit and breath anything Sony makes, [[lie|who deliver completely unbiased reports on everything PlayStation]].
