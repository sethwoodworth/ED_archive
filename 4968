Lord of the Rings

'''''The Lord of the Rings''''' is a series of three popular films that were later adapted into shitty books.

== The Books ==

J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the set of novels after having a bad acid trip as well as [[fapping]] over C.S Lewis's foot while being sodomized by a dwarf named Danny Devito. So inspired by his stupor, he cobbled together his drunken dreamings into [[tl;dr]] writings about a black person called [[Dildo]] Faggins, his [[cock]]ring and an [[incest]]uous relationship with his nephew that would be ripped off by every fantasy work for [[at least 100 years ago|the rest of time]]. J.R.R. Tolkien obviously copied ''Lord of The Rings'' from 3 places using his super tight Mage skills that he got after getting to level 80, because they were written about 10-50 years later.''[[Harry Potter]]'', ''Lord of the Flies'' <--dude, couldn't he think of a better name? and ''Clueless''. Don't you think Dumbledore was like Gandalf, and Dildo looked like Alicia Silverstone at the beginning of the film? 

== The Movies ==

Peter Jackson made Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings'' Trilogy into a series of movies that were released over a period of three years. The movies were filmed on [[New Zealand|some forgotten former colony]], made truck loads of money, won a whole bunch of Oscars, and gave [[nerd|nerds]], [[geek|geeks]] and the "LotR" [[fandom]] something with which to be infatuated for a few months.
While the Trilogy was fairly popular among [[mundane]]s, it swept through [[geek]] and [[nerd]] culture like a forest fire, bolstering the books' already-strong fandom. Thanks to Jackson, ''Lord of the Rings'' fandom is now one of the largest and most prevalent fandoms in the world, despite the franchise being total shit. Each movie is [[over 9000]] hours long and are just a series of clever angles on two 4 ft. tall fucknuggets walking to a mountain or a group of fags, lead by the [[pedophilia|white jizzard,]] always walking to like 50 different castles. [[copypasta from Clerks 2|All LoTR is is walking. Everywhere, walking, all the time. Even the trees walk in the movies. The original ending to The Return of The King was a Sam-Fagdo suckfest and just before the credits roll, Fagdo just flat out bricks in Sam's mouth.]]

==Tom Bombadil==

The worst character ever designed in the history of [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] fantasy. A 13-year old [[dungeons and dragons|DM]] could come up with something more interesting. [[all caps|THREE FUCKING CHAPTERS]] are devoted to this black person and you could seriously just skip all of them and not miss any story(but you would miss some really homo songs). When that disgusting [[neckbeard|neckbeard]] [[fat|Peter Jackson]] took him out of the movies, nobody cared.

== "LotR" Fandom ==

''Lord of the Rings'' fandom is rivaled only by ''[[Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer|Buffy]]'' fandom in terms of size. The Internets are riddled with [[communities]] and websites dedicated to the books and movies. "Ringers," as individual fans refer to themselves, are notorious writers of "LotR"-based [[fanfic]] and [[slashfic]], and they similarly never seem to get tired of making [[LJ]] [[icon|icons]] based on scenes from the movies. 

Unlike many other fandoms, Lord of the Rings fandom boasts a sizable population of [[woman|women]]. Female fans tend to be [[fangirl]]s who are obsessed with the effeminate [[Elvis|elven]] character named "Legolas", probably because he seems like the type of guy who enjoys [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|cuddling, long walks in the woods and so forth.]] Because of Orlando Bloom, Legolas is also absurdly popular EVERY [[teenager|teenage]] GIRL EVER! As they find him to be "safe" (i.e., [[homosexual|gay]]), and thus they can posture all they want without having to worry about [[sex|putting out]].

[[Cosplay]] is also a fairly popular activity among "Ringers", who seem to enjoy dressing up like their favorite characters because, while the ''Lord of the Rings'' characters are themselves attractive and adventurous, most fans are decidedly not. On-line examples of this behavior are rife, with some good examples being found [http://doors.stanford.edu/~sr/legolas/ at Stanford] and [http://tot.rei-li.com/lotr.php other excellent universities].

==George Lucas does LotR==
Apparently, Hollywood's #2 [[retard|genius]] [[almost raped|almost directed]] the trilogy. Here's an excerpt from a documentary about this great loss:

{{quote|Hey guys. Lucas is a genius. Let me tell you, Lord of teh rings sucked and would have been better had Lucas directed it!}}

{{quote|that is absolute bullshit. cleasrly ur small mind cant bring u to understand the magnitude and beauty of Lord of the Rings.}}

{{quote|Seriously, if George Lucas did use puppets for episodes 1,2, and 3 you would of ctiticized him for that! What's wrong with episode 1,2, and 3? Nothing. I'm a Star Wars Geek, and TRUE fans don't give a crap about the newest episodes. You guys r idiots.}}

{{quote|Uh...if Lucas hadn't made the innovations he did during the 70s and 80s, LOTR wouldn't exist in it's current state. Douche}}

{{quote|Hayden was perfect as "evil" Anakin}}


{{quote|What's that movie about the gay guys on the mountain? Oh yeah! Lord of the Rings!}}

==Mini-Balrogs==
Based upon the original OFU's guardians, mini-Balrogs are small versions of the ''Lord of the Rings'''s demon Balrog who are partial to bacon, raw eggs, and [[fangirl|fangirls]]. Their names come from misspellings of characters' names or places, so that every similar misspelling is referred to as a mini.  Other [[fandom|fandoms]] use mini-acromantulas (''[[Harry Potter]]''), monkeys (''Pirates of the Caribbean''), or mini-luggages (''Discworld''), but the term mini-Balrog can typically be applied to any fandom.
