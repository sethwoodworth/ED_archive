{{an hero}}
<br>
'''Jeff Weise''' (aka {{lj|user=weise}}) was an honest-to-God [[Indian|Injun]], as well as an [[angsty teen]] from [[Minnesota]]. These three defining characteristics --His Injun-hood, his angsty teen-hood, and his Minnessotan-hood-- formed the greatest trifecta of [[Native American]] [[rage]] since Geronimo, leading to the [[Lulz|Red Lake High School shoot'em-up]]. Like most angsty teens and all High School shooters, Jeff was a massive [[fanboi]] of [[e-popular|famous]] celebrities [[Columbine|Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]].

==The [[IRL]] drama==

{{quote|I try not to be aggressive in most situations, I'll use force if I have to, but I'm not about to go out and pick a fight. I'm mostly defensive, I'll defend myself if someone tries something but other than that I'm a peaceful person.|Jeff Weise, moments before starting a shoot-out with the [[cops]].}}

On March 21, 2005, Weise stole [[Guns|2 handguns and a shotgun]] and [[pwned]] his grandparents. He then stole his grandfather's police cruiser, crashed it into his school, and pwned 7 more classmates before [[suicide|self-pwning]]. [[Old media|Newspapers and TV stations]] around the nation immediately jumped on the story and [[fap|masturbated furiously]] to the topic of [[Gore|school-shootings and violence]] for several weeks until, [[I CAME|flushed and weak in the knees]], they finally moved back to the severely more important news schedule of [[Natalee Holloway|arbitrary missing white women]] and [[Lindsay Lohan]]'s latest [[eating disorder]]. Naturally, this brief media frenzy ensured a new round of pointless [[IRL drama]] combined with the [[typical]] routine criticism of [[Music|Marilyn Manson]] and the temporary banning of all [[Hot Topic]] merchandise from school grounds. Somewhere along the line, some [[Concerned Mother|concerned mothers]] probably got involved as well, but that's [[Shit nobody cares about|shit only they care about.]]

==On the [[Internets]]==

Before killing himself, Weise was known for his various activities on the [[internets]]. He made many posts on various [[Nazi]] websites (knowing that Hitler didn't give a fuck about Native Americans and only cared about Germany). Weise also created several [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/195194 violent flash videos] on [[Newgrounds]] and started an LJ account, where he made 3 brief posts inquiring about [[cutting]], [[Never drinking again|alcoholism]], [[Grammar Nazi|grammatical errors]], and other [[gay]] [[shit]].
