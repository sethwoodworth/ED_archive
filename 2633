In late January, 2010 several emailed “letters to the editor” began to appear in major cities newspapers.  These emails, always signed with the enigmatic name “'''Ellie Light''',” supported [[President]] [[Barack Obama]]’s administration, admonished moderate [[Democrats]] who were skeptical of Obama, and blamed [[Republicans]] for all of the world’s woes.  Curiously, all of these emails seemed to have originated near to the newspaper they appeared in.  

Bleeding heart liberals rejoiced at the [[porn|content]] of these emails.  Was this some new grass-roots movement that would save Obama’s [[fail|flagging]] public image?  Nobody could say, but a young [[whore|reporter,]] Sabrina Eaton of the [[family guy|Cleveland]] Plain Dealer, felt compelled to find out just who Ellie Light was.  What she discovered surprised us all.

An “Astroturf campaign” is a term referring to a political [[conspiracy|subterfuge or propaganda]] planned out and put into use by an organization.  This subterfuge is meant to create the impression of being [[gay|hip and popular]] but really masks the hidden intent of those who created it.  Folks see the Astroturf and think it is grass, something green and wholesome, just like a grass-roots movement founded by common citizens and rooted deep within the community [[conscience]].   However the grass is really synthetic plastic and the campaign only a tool used to sway public perception.

==Scrambling for Answers==

When it was discovered that [[over 9000|over 65]] major metropolitan newspapers had received emails from Ellie Light, [[cocksuckers|pundits]] and [[dicks everywhere|lawmakers]] began to take notice.  These letters all used the same language and contained nearly identical ideas, but they all were signed by an Ellie Light from some different part of the country.  For example, an Ellie Light email sent to the editor of the San Francisco Chronical would be signed “Ellie Light of Northern California,” whereas a letter to the editor of the Denver Post would be signed “Ellie Light of Boulder.”  

[[you|Republicans]] smelled something rotten in Washington other than themselves.  [[fags|Journalists]] scrambled to find out just who this Ellie Light person was, but the person or group had hidden their tracks well and investigators were stumped.  Some speculated that the emails originated from the White House staff, noting that David Axelrod, Obama’s chief of staff was fully capable of [[fapping|engineering a stunt like this.]]

[[you|Democrats]] viciously [[NO U|attacked back, stating that the emails were so obviously a Republican plant, nobody could be stupid enough to believe that they could come from the White House or some politically motivated group.]]

What was certain was that a blame game was going on and nobody had any real answers.  At one point, right wing pundits such as Sean Hannity speculated that Michelle Obama herself wrote the infernal letters.

Sabrina Eaton, a reporter for the Cleveland Plain Dealer who covers events in Washington DC, remembered that she had an old acquaintance named [[orly|Ellie Light.]]  She sent this Ellie person an email but received no response.  Finally, being inquisitive by nature, she plugged the full name of the emails author into Google and was [[yarly|shocked to discover]] that there were several “letters to the editor” from all over the country and all signed by “Ellie Light.”  What she did next is what any self respecting journalist would do: [[win|she wrote an article about the phenomena.]]

==Sneaky==

Sabrina’s article noted that all of the letters had similar diction and writing style and also [[JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR!|carried the same message.]]  She was intrigued by this, but at the same time she questioned how newspapers verify the information they print.  Because of this, many people noted that just about anybody, using the right [[tool]]s, could say just about anything on the internet…[[anonymous|and get away with it.]]  it was at that point that the political name/blame [[fapping|finger-pointing]] game began.

At this writing, nobody really knows how the letters were sent.  But readers of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] are well versed in the use of proxies to hide their computers and ultimately their identities.  Such common knowledge could have easily been gleaned from the [[internet]] and put to use by the perpetrator of the letters to the editor.  

With that in mind, the writer of the emails should still be commended for eluding [[snapesnogger|discovery.]]  Some of the nation’s [[retards|brightest security experts]] were befuddled by the source of the emails, and it finally took the real person behind the Ellie Light letters to come forward [[dickgirl|himself]] for the true beginnings of this massive political [[troll]] to be discovered.

==Just Who Really Is Ellie Light?==
[[File:Ellie light 1.jpg|thumb|The real Ellie Light - Winston Steward.  NO, he doesn't look like a left wing nut at all!]]
[[File:Ellie Light 5.jpg|thumb|This picture looks like it was taken on a commune ranch.]]
After a series of phone calls and emails, a 51-year-old health care worker named Winston Steward came forward and took the responsibility for the Ellie Light [[email]]s.  In a case of epic [[troll's remorse]], he stated "I am Winston Steward and have been sending the letters from Ellie Light.  I hope this ends any confusion and sets the record [[fag|straight."]]  Steward claims that he invented the persona of Light to [[baw|“protect himself from criticism and possible physical attacks” and that he used fake addresses across the country to get newspapers to publish his emails.]]   A quick check against the email address that sent the original email to the Cleveland Plain Dealer against the email address of this admission found that the person behind the confession was the true originator of the emails.  

But it gets weirder.

During the process of discovery, Steward, in an attempt to further hide his identity, told news agencies that he was in fact one [[wut|Barbara Brooks]], but most people weren’t fooled as the voice was far too masculine to be a woman.  Still, a quick check was again performed, and the real Barbara Brooks was found to be married to Steward.  In fact, when she was pressed with questions, she quickly caved in and outted Steward to the national media.  

{{quote|Affiliated with an organized group? No, I've never been affiliated with anyone like that.|So you hoax the country and then tell everybody you are a woman...and you expect us to believe you now?}}

Steward’s reaction to being outted by his wife was just as senseless as the whole mess he was already in.  He told reporters that he was no longer married to Brooks but she  had another story:

{{quote|He's making up all kinds of garbage. We're not divorced. We're not separated. He just doesn't want anybody to trace him because he's afraid of the right-wing crazies up in Bakersfield.|Wait, just who is crazy here?}}

However this quote and all that entails has come under scrutiny as well.  Is the couple divorced?  Steward still claims that they are and cites a divorce attorney's name: "Tabone Enklery," a name that doesn't sound made up at all. Needless to say, there's no attorney by that name registered with the Texas Bar Association. Furthermore, Steward has spelled the name Tabone Enklery several different ways during correspondence.

Many Emails similar to this one appeared in major market newspapers during January of 2010:

<center><div class="noprint" style="clear: right; border: solid #aaa 1px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; font-size: 90%; background: #CCCCCC; width: 700px; padding: 4px; spacing: 0px; text-align: left; float: center;"> <div style="float: center;"></div> <div style="margin-left: 10px;">
A year ago, if we had read in the paper that employers were hiring again, that health care legislation was proceeding without a bump, that Afghanistan suddenly became a nice place to take your kids, we would've known we were being lied to. Back then, we recognized that the problems Obama inherited as president wouldn't go away overnight.

During his campaign, Obama clearly said that an economy that took eight years to break couldn't be fixed in a year, that Afghanistan was a graveyard of empires and would not be an easy venture for us. Candidate Obama didn't feed us happy talk, which is why we elected him. He never said America could solve our health care, economic and security problems without raising the deficit. Instead, he talked of hard choices, of government taking painful and contentious first steps towards fixing problems that can't be left for another day.

Right after Obama's election, we seemed to grasp this. We understood that companies would be happy to squeeze more work out of frightened employees, and would be slow to hire more. We understood that the banks that had extorted us out of billions of dollars, were lying when they said they would share their recovery. We understood that a national consensus on health care would not come easily. Candidate Obama never claimed that his proposed solutions would work flawlessly right out of the box, and we respected him for that.

But today, the president is being attacked as if he were a salesman who promised us that our problems would wash off in the morning. He never made such a promise. It's time for Americans to realize that governing is hard work, and that a president can't just wave a magic wand and fix everything.

|Actually, I take it back. It’s a whole lot freaky, too.

|I'm not Ellie Light, my husband is. I never told anybody that I was Ellie Light. Winston wrote every single letter.

I told him from the beginning that he shouldn't write letters under phony names, but he wanted to get them out there.|Barbara Brooks on her insane husband.

|So wait, she's married to a woman who pretends to be a man except on the phone? And then she writes letters but blames them on her/him, except sometimes but not other times?|Quoted from Gawker article.

|Whoever is sitting down and doing this..it's a full time job. This is part of the Obama machine.  And it's okay that they are doing this.  The problem is that nobody is watching the shop.  Blame the old media.|Brett Bozell from MRC.org

If you are a bleeding heart liberal, don't bother watching these videos.  You won't hear anything they are saying and you won't believe them if you manage to actually hear the message.
