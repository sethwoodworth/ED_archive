{{main|Ultima Online}}

'''UOGamers: Hybrid''' is an ''[[Ultima Online]]'' [[Ultima_Online#Free_Shards|Freeshard]]. The shard is expensively run by [http://www.rynet.net/ Ryan McAdams], who is rumored to secretly be [[Ron Paul]] in [[Secret_Squirrel | disguise]]. The server is based around "classic" ''Ultima Online'', yet T2A, some AOS items, ect are available, mostly as rares. The name "Hybrid" reportedly comes from clashing together the [[shit|best of the old ]] and the [[shit|best of the new]] into one great [[shit|Freeshard ]]. [[Lulz]] via forum-[[raid]] and in-game griefing are acceptable and encouraged.

==History==
*'''2002'''
**Beta Stages

*'''2003''' 
**'''December''': Shard sees a massive wipe. A multiple-day outage leads to an empty server and 800 or so raged players. A handful return immediately, but most **come back down the line.

*'''2004'''
**'''October''': [[shit_no_one_cares_about | Clean Up Britannia launched.]]
**'''December''': Secluded Wind house dropped by staff with 200+ players in attendance.

*'''2005'''
**'''January-May''': Factions implemented, [IC] is formed and lead by erax0r and reality, krrios client becomes publicly available 
**'''July''': Entourage is formed, lead by former [IC] leaders Socrates and Brother of [[Jesus]], with the goal of teaching players to PvP. PvP in general sees a high point.
**'''August''': YES and Ck6, easily the two best guilds, disappear with the school year. [[pussy | Delucia Pond duel pits become safe zones for the first time,]] sparking a revival in the dueling scene but a decline in field PvP.
**'''August-October''': The Lil Wyte clones are the only stable PvP guild, with 31D and ... the only others consistently playing; PvP at its worst ever.
**'''November-January''': r33n forms N*SYNC. 31D stabilizes. Legion of Doom returns. YES returns full force as Engage with Rage. PvP sees a revival unlike any before.

*'''2006'''
**'''January-March''': Rage membership drops from Jenova, Daz, FCM and Flipper to Jenova, FCM and Flipper, then to just Jenova and Flipper as everyone starts playing [[WoW]] randomly. PvP starts to see another decline, as [[gangbang | zerg]] guilds are the only present force.
**'''March''': Much-hyped classic server [[shit | UOG: Divinity is released]], temporarily distracting some players from Hybrid.
**'''April''': Player vendor mall formed by [[moderator | Addicted]] and Flipper. It sees immediate success, as players across the shard flock to it and set up their own vendors.
**'''May''': [[azn | Dynasty]] is formed by co-GMs Flipper and Bobby McPrescott. Also, [SS], lead by Bugs Bunny, runs the shard with admittedly lame but legal tactics. Nobody really opposes them.
**'''June''': Grey-lead c2w joins the shard, forcing most of the talented players to adapt to their unusual play style.
**'''August''': A few names make comebacks, but nothing significant occurs.
**'''September''': The player vendor mall project is temporarily suspended.
**'''October''': PvP dies.
**'''December''': The player vendor mall is sold.

*'''2007'''

==Player Types==
[[Image:Wonuo.jpg|thumb|261px|LEIK OMG IS TAHT FALLON ROEB?]]
*[[newfag | Newbies]] - The majority of the playerbase, including no-namers who actually ''hunt'' without 7x mares, potions and invulnerability-armor. Seriously, who even does that?
*[[fag | PvPers]] -[[1337 |  t3h r33t krew]] - Cheap idiots, usually in [[rape | gank squads]], because they have little individual skill. Wouldn't leave their house without invulnerability armor, twenty of each type of potion, their expensive but [[gay | crappy-looking outfit]], perfect weapon, [[dildo | bola-balls]], deadly-poisoned weapon(s), and [[at_least_100 | friends]]
**Bola fags - Because they can't field, they carry [[dildo | bola-balls]] around. When used, they knock the opponent off of their mount, allowing the faggot to brutally ass rape them.
**Factioners - Gank perfected. 5-10 over-equipped faggots ride around Britain, dropping on loners. After 5v1ing a newb who accidentally joined an opposing faction and is trying to get resurrected, they usually yell "LOL OWNED" and "DIRTED 1v1", among other [[retarded]] shit.
*Banksitter - The rich assholes who rule the broken economy. Most wear their ridiculously shitty-looking rare items they received from giving a [[moderator | GM]] a [[BJ]]. Often, they wear other items they buy for insanely low prices, mostly because newbies respect rich niggers,  before they finally resell it for twice the price they bought it for from a starving newbie. Suicide lingers in their mind constantly if they do not have [[at_least_100 | at least 100]] million-gold-checks in the bank at all times.
*PKers - Red-named murderers. Usually rolling alone or with one friend, PKers rarely roll in large squads, or for/against blue (non-murderer) PvPers. They use their time killing miners, [[AFK]]s and tamers. Like the PvPer, they have adopted their [[gay | cheap]] methods and only roll with ten times more equipment than they need.
**[[Griefer]]s - PKers who go the extra step - When killing someone, they loot everything, mock and leave them there, or res them and kill them again. Many other methods are used, and the usual outcome is 30% lulz, 70% drama.
*Tamers - Many are newbie, some are [[leet | r33t]], but all are scared of any other player, red or not. Most tamers have never seen, let alone spoken to, another player, even other tamers, and recall (teleport) away whenever anyone comes onscreen.

==Events==

Events make for [[lulz]], as when a four-team capture the flag is being [[srs | srsly]] conducted, [[Anonymous]] can wedge themselves in doors [[for the lulz]], blocking their team mates completely. Doing this over and over will produce a lot of [[drama]], and should be conducted at nearly every event. However, because the [[moderator | GMs]] are [[srs bsns]] [[faggot | faggots]], it's best to use alt accounts like a real [[Patriotic Nigra]] with skill. Players' event rights get [[v&]] for any type of [[lulz]] in game, and therefore the srs remain completely silent under penalty of event [[b&]].

==Celebrities==
*'''The GMs''' - They make events, suck the owners balls, [[ban]] you and occasionally spawn [[satan | demons]] on top of you. [[gg]]
*'''Cuntessa''' - Owner of 'Tessa's Cove, a [[shit | shitty]][http://members.shaw.ca/countessamk/index.html runebook library].
*'''Rambone''' - One of the [[pimp | richest men]] on the server. [[shit_no_one_cares_about | Has unique sandals and apron, a castle, hooded shroud, ect.]]
*'''Sir Yoyo''' - One of the other [[Jew golds| richest men]].
*'''Dave Lepard and Ozzy''' - [[Sweden | Swedish dudes]], [[forum]] [[lurk | lurkers]] and possibly [[gay]] lovers.
*'''BT''' - [[13_year_old_boys | 13 year old]] well-known [[roleplay | role player]]/banksitter. [[no|No longer]][[b&]] from forums. [[OH SHI-]]
*'''Suil Ban''' - Ex-forum [[mod]] and [[grammar nazi]]. He is now a [[whore]] and washed up [[faggot]].
*'''Caz''' - Quit UO. Ex-forum [[troll]] and leader of role playing guild SSG.
