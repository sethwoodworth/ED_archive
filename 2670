Enjoy your time protesting
''The phrase that any conscientious police officer utters just before he cracks [[hippie]] and black person skulls with his riot baton.''

==Applications==
Screaming '''"ENJOY YOUR TIME PROTESTING!!!"''' makes brain matter seep in reverse from the pavement - back into the safe, wet, and warm confines of the cranial sack.

==Origin==

During the Great [[Anonymous]] Uprising of 2008 against the [[Scientology|Church of Scientology]] in Los Angeles, one [[pig|cop]] (Sergeant Wayne Guillary) emerged from the pigstye to do his fucking job - which primarily involved <s>tasing the fuck out of college students who ask too many questions</s> ensuring that the protesters were safe. 

For the courageous and noble act of doing what he gets paid to do, he was instantly canonized on [[Digg]] by [[at least 100]] mouth-breathing liberal fucks who screamed that he should be [[win|sucked off by 72 virgins and crowned King of the Internets.]]
