'''Robert S. Minton,''' AKA Daddy Whorebucks is a [[moralfag]], [[IRL|real life]] [[troll]], and possible Jew who, for ten years, slept on the streets of clear water eating a diet of nothing but rice, beans, and water.  After trolling the investment world for twenty years and losing people all kinds of money, Bob decided it was time to put his skills to the test and troll the [[Scientology|Cult of Scientology]] he quickly joined up with other [[moralfags]] such as [[Magoo|Tory Christman]] and [[Mark Bunker]].  For six years, Minton would be seen [[trolling]] the streets of [[Scientology|Clearwater]] shouting and screaming whilst holding a sign with some kind of slogan on it (or none at all because he's THAT hardcore).  The source of Bob Minton's power is prior to the death of [[Hubbard|L Ron Hubbard]] Minton used his exterior OT [[bullshit|abilities]] to fly to the site of Hubbard's deathbed and consume his blood and his skull.
