'''Writing yourself into an article''' is a common practice of [[USI|vainglorious bastards]] with [[no friends]] or shortage of [[ego]]. Occasionally a source of [[WikiEdit_Drama|wiki edit drama]]. It's a surreptitious act so demanding of care you'll rarely see an instance not out of place or that doesn't scream [[attention whore]]. Proves there's a fine line between that [[namefag|shameless plug]] or documenting that [[In Joke|in joke]] nobody cares about to begin with.  

==Facts==
Most often perpetrated by: 
#Faggots hungry for [[e-peen]].
#[[SSP|Glory troll]]s.
#[[Lamers]].
#[[Special:Log/delete|Shitposters]].
#[[Spammers]].
#[[PieAreSquare]].
#[[PBF]].
#[[You|People new to internets]]. 
#[[Kanye West]].
#[[TVTropes|The Losers on TVTropes]].
#[[Uncyclopedia|Uncyclopedians]].
*Perpetrators often get [[self-pwn|counter-trolled]] for the lulz.  
*Sly attempts often combine a name drop with transparent and shallow [[unfunny|self-deprecation]].  
*Users wise enough to use [[sockpuppets]] are usually only slightly more successful, doing it on your main account just makes you a clueless [[whore]].  
*A level of internet faggotry only exceeded by [[auto-fellatio|writing an article on yourself]].  
*Common among users who [[Wikipedo|list their fucking contribs on their userpage]].  
*Very often goes hand-in-hand with spamming your shitty WMM YouTube "trolling" video all over the fucking place (HAY GUIZE I TROLLD THIS GUY SO HARD CHECKOUT MAH VID!!!1!)
*Has trolling potential as it can be used to create the appearance another user is trying to promote themselves via sockpuppets, thereby forcing them run around removing the instances to avoid embarrassment.  
*A case where [[TOW]] actually has it right...some shit is gay no matter where you do it.  
*Usually an [[oldfag]] will know exactly where and exactly how this is done so that you will hardly notice.  If you do notice, chances are it was some dbag begging for a [[banhammer]].  
*Proof a fine line tends to separate the [[Win|wheat]] from the [[Fail|chaff]].
