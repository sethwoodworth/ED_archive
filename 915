'''Belome''', the corpulent father of [[Pikaman|Pikachu]] is a [[fat]], [[azn|yellow]] creature with four malignant head tumors from Super Mario RPG, an extremely over-rated SNES game featuring memorable characters such as a gay puff of cloud and a possessed doll. He appeared on /b/ offering to consume failed memes; similar to the [[Milhouse]] controversy, he is under scrutiny after he became styled "greatest [[meme]]" on account of a lucky [[fag]] who [[GET|rolled]] his way into the record books.

== The "Meme-Eater", The Get ==

History was made on August 5th, 2009, when a lonely SMRPG [[fag]] posted a thread stating, "Beholden, for I am become Belome, eater of memes. Feed me a meme, and I shall return a more powerful meme than the [[internets|interwebz]] could ever imagine." Aside from an eager anon offering to feed the creature [[Milhouse|failures]], OP was trolled until one lucky [[fag|anon]] changed the course of the webz as we know it.

[[Image:1249234634349.png|left|thumb|Mere seconds before the get was rolled...]] Suddenly, the poster made a daring gamble, one which could have backfired and ended his life: a double-or-nothing bid to secure Belome an undying spot in /b/ memedom. On-lookers laughed until the poster made his [[over 9000|inconceivable]] get, which instated Belome as the "greatest meme". This was highly-questioned, and was under intense investigation when [[samefag]] then rolled to rename /b/ after Belome...and got what he wanted.
