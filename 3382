GoddessMillenia/RLJPM
[[GoddessMillenia]]/RLJPM, [[TL;DR]].

<pre>
<RLJ> I think you lost.
<GoddessMillenia> Who is this?
<RLJ> I'm just someone.  Who are you?
<GoddessMillenia> Depends
<RLJ> You mean sometimes you're different people?
<RLJ> You were so chatty before, why so quiet now?
<GoddessMillenia> Because some guy keeps talking to me excessively.
<GoddessMillenia> And I can't get a word in edge wise.
<RLJ> How does that make you feel?
<GoddessMillenia> It doesn't bother me.
<GoddessMillenia> It's just why I'm not chatty with you.
<RLJ> So what does bother you?
<GoddessMillenia> Hmm, well, this isn't goddess millenia.
<GoddessMillenia> But nothing bothers me.
<RLJ> So you're another person?  Who are you now?
<GoddessMillenia> GoddessMillenia: That was My friend Andrew
<GoddessMillenia> and you people don't know your spelling and grammar
<GoddessMillenia> We are in College
<GoddessMillenia> Stop acting like you're in 3rd grade
<RLJ> So is this GM now?
<RLJ> Hello?
<GoddessMillenia> yes.
<GoddessMillenia> well, not now.
<GoddessMillenia> but that was her.
<RLJ> It would be a lot less confusing if you changed the nickname
<RLJ> I was just saying to her earlier that she didn't do so well at trying to get her information off of the website.
<RLJ> That seems to have worked as well as the challenger.
<GoddessMillenia> What?
<GoddessMillenia> I don't what you're talking about.
<RLJ> You know, the challenger space shuttle?  The one that exploded?
<RLJ> That occurred to me as a metaphor for how badly GM's arbchat went
<GoddessMillenia> Well, the challenger incident was pretty funny though.
<GoddessMillenia> I mean, that's entertainment.
<RLJ> I always thought it was funny that the explosion and vapor trail looked like a giant spooge
<RLJ> But you see, the challenger situation was an accident
<RLJ> And the arbchat was no accident . . . unless you count having your head up your ass as an accident
<GoddessMillenia> Hah, I've never heard it put that way, but good point on the splooge comparison.
<RLJ> I mean, what was up with that Picasso thing?
<RLJ> I mean, what was the thought process there?
<GoddessMillenia> Personally, I don't like Picasso.
<GoddessMillenia> But maybe the problem is people just see things differently and you guys hate her becuase she doesn't look at things the same way you do.
<RLJ> I think the problem arose from the fact that she wouldn't really respond to the other people in the chat, and just did her own thing, in her own little world.
<RLJ> She may have mental issues that prevent her from relating to others.  Seriously.  This sort of thing has probably cropped up before, and will probably crop again, unless she gets some sort of professional help.
<GoddessMillenia> I think she just struggled to get everything typed with all of the things coming at once.
<GoddessMillenia> She already is getting the help.  But I think people just not be too quick to judge on things.
<RLJ> And if she had read http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/ED:DEL and followed the advice she would have done a lot better at getting the stuff she wanted removed.  I can't say it would have worked, but look at what happened instead.
<RLJ> I mean, that entire arbchat log is on the website now, she actually added to the lulz at her expense rather than removing it.
<RLJ> Not the best outcome.
<GoddessMillenia> True, but the thing is also, that you guys say that no one should defend themselves becuase they should just take it.  But some of the Lulz pages are a defense against people from other places.
<RLJ> I think she did a pretty crappy job of defending herself, don't you?
<RLJ> I mean, have you read the arbchat log?
<RLJ> It's legendary.
<GoddessMillenia> Honestly, other than her page, I've never read anything on Encyclopedia Dramatica.
<GoddessMillenia> I've just read all of the disclaimers.
<GoddessMillenia> And things that explain the website.
<RLJ> I can't remember the last time I laughed that hard at her refusing to answer simple questions, specious arguments, and indecipherable "logic."
<RLJ> Well if you havn't read it then you don't know what I'm talking about.
<GoddessMillenia> I really don't.
<GoddessMillenia> I'm just trying to have an impartial and unbiased view of the whole situation.
<RLJ> Yeah, well I could be wrong, but here's what I think happened.
<RLJ> GM blanked pages on ED.  That's against the rules.  She was banned.
<RLJ> She wanted pictures and information relating to her on the site removed.  She got an arbchat to try to resolve it.
<GoddessMillenia> Yes, but I know she did more editing, and I know she did that first, because I was there when she did it.
<GoddessMillenia> And she not only had it deleted, but was banned.
<RLJ> Instead of acting as someone in a position of no power should, with some decorum and awareness that she should speak carefully, she instead insulted the very people she should have been trying to persuade to help her.
<GoddessMillenia> That's a little harsh, since that's what they allow.
<RLJ> So they didn't.  And the end result is that there's even more insulting material relating to her on the website, the arbchat log.
<GoddessMillenia> Hmm, but isn't that them just not liking what she says, so posting it on the site in defense?
<RLJ> And yes, they ban blankers
<RLJ> no
<RLJ> post because it's hilarious
<RLJ> you havn't read it
<RLJ> you have no idea how funny it is
<GoddessMillenia> I haven't.
<RLJ> I know
<RLJ> You should
<GoddessMillenia> Those people in the chatroom talk a lot.
<GoddessMillenia> I'm not even paying attentio nto what they are saying.
<RLJ> That's probably a good move.
<RLJ> The first one you've made tonight.
<GoddessMillenia> Me, or goddessmillenia?
<RLJ> Whoever said "those people in the chatroom talk a lot"
<GoddessMillenia> Well, Goddessmillenia does, I don't care enough about what they are saying to pay attention.
<RLJ> I'm just saying that tonight has been an epic fail on her part.
<RLJ> She must be new at this sort of thing.
<GoddessMillenia> Ok, I might be back later to continue chatting, but me,=Andrew, is going to go watch TV.
<RLJ> Another good move, watching tv has no consequences.
<RLJ> Unlike the internet.
<RLJ> Data never dies, you know.
<GoddessMillenia> Ok, have a nice night.
<RLJ> I will
<GoddessMillenia> peace
<RLJ> Sure
