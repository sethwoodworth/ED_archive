Lolrus
'''Lolrus''' is (was...[[Talk:I Has a Bucket|''';_;''']]) actually a giant seal named Minazo who amazed and amused (aka '''"[[lulz|kekeke]]"''') [[azn]] audiences at a Japanese aquarium. 

After becoming [[e-famous]] and beloved by the Internets following [[Internets English|a trend]] set by the [[i has a shuvel]] frog he remained a somewhat obscure [[meme]] until the [[period|cuntrags]] at [[I Can Has Cheezburger]] got hold of it and turned it into a [[Pop Culture]] phenom as they'd already done when they ruined [[Caturday]] by turning it into [[Lolcat]]s.

In tribute to this [[EPIC]] [[downs|downy]] water mammal the [[OG]] "[[I Has a Bucket]]" macro will stand alone on its own page. Meanwhile, Internets [[newfag]]s can post all future '''Lolrus''' [[macros]] here.

You will be missed Bucket Seal.

=Elephant Seals=
Although Minazo was a jolly old elephant seal that just wanted his bucket back, a lot of elephant seals are IRL [[trolls]] that hate everything, especially beachside towns. So in a way they're like Godzilla or something.


=I Has a Bucket=
Hello, [[downs|downie]] water-mammal.
