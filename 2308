'''[[User:Doc James|Doc James]]'''‎ (AKA [[Asshole|User:Jmh649]]), is the pseudonym of Dr. [[Fucktard|James Heilman]] of [[Shithole|Moose Jaw]], Canada. A former [[Perez Hilton|shemale]] model he is currently employed photographing indigent patients in the emergency room in Moose Jaw, he also is an [[Nerd|Administrator]] and resident medical [[expert]] on [[Wikipedia]], a scary [[Virgin|Wikidragon]] and [[an hero]].

In 2009 [[Asshole|Doc James]] posted the Rohrschach inkblots on Wikipedia, he felt that according to his expertise witholding this information would be like the "[[WTF|Chinese government's censorship of the Tiananmen Square Massacre]]. ..."[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/technology/internet/29inkblot.html?pagewanted=all]. He was on television and in the news all over the world which swelled his head and helped compensate for his feelings of [[butthurt|inadequacy]] due to his small [[penis]].

When not hard at work taking pictures of men's testicles [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Subcutaneous_emphysema.JPG], Doc James likes to relax by playing with his own balls. According to Doc [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jmh649] "''one of my favorite activities, [[masturbating|juggling]] five [[testicles|balls]]''". [[WTF|WTF?]].

'''Doc James' Dickisms'''

[[Attention whore|Doc James]] is also a Clinical Assistant Professor at the University of Saskatchewan and a Clinical Instructor at the University of British Columbia. Where he utilizes his amazing mastery of the English language to teach the next generation of doctors.
