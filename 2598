The '''Edison Chen photo scandal''' is an enormous [[internets]] drama raging in [[Hong Kong]] sparked by sexy photos taken by Edison Chen, [[Asia]]n heart-throb and star of the shit movie ''The Grudge II''.

When Edison put his broken [[gay|pink]] [[Powerbook|PowerBook]] computer into be fixed he forgot one minor detail, it was filled with self photographed [[porn]]o of 14 of [[China]]'s most popular actresses. [[In Soviet Russia...|In soviet China]] the [[internets]] are policed with great vigor and brutality, so when these images were leaked onto the internets there was insane [[butthurt]] all around.

The police responded by [[jail]]ing every IT geek responsible for stealing the images and attempting to [[internet police|police the internet]] and delete all copies of them. Needless to say they failed hard. The jailed geeks were seen by most Chinese as noble martyrs for the great cause of [[free speech]] and after a [[HUEG]] outcry they were released.

On [[Project Chanology|February 10]] there was a protest where approximately 300 internets users marched in Victoria Park whining about [[discrimination|discriminatory]] behavior against innocent internets users.

==The Aftermath==
Reliable rumors circulated that a major crime [[gang]] called the Triads had offered [[over 9000|$500,000]] to anyone who hacked off his hand. This made Edison shit his [[cum]] stained panties, preventing him from returning to Hong Kong.

Edison then went on to get a terrible case of [[Troll's remorse]] and [http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=382760 quit Hong Kong forever], apologizing profusely to all those who he has hurt.

==The Defense==
Regardless, he will still have gotten moar pussy than all of you whining [[Aids|syphilitic]] slant-eyed gook motherfuckers.  Too bad he was too much of a faggot to point out this fact.
