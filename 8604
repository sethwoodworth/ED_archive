==Effects of texting==
As texting becomes more and more accessible to [[Prostatot|young children]], a decrease in the collective intelligence of the human race grows imminent. Not surprisingly, most texting goes down in [[Fail|America]]. The type of [[Americunts|parents]] that allow their children to text uncontrollably are usually [[White|white]] ungrateful shits that [[Pop_parenting|grew up]] living sheltered lives (all inherited traits among honkeys). This lifestyle subsequently led to a fear of [[black people]], so they send their [[Retards|kids]] to private school so they can waste even more money (that their kids aren't already spending on [[Drugs|drugs]]). Texters and their parents are [[Some_argue|arguably]] the [[4chan|cancer that is killing America]].

In short, texting turns you into [[Fred|this fucking abomination]].
