Toilet Seat

The '''toilet seat''' is a non-essential part of most [[Toilet|lavatories]].  It is of little interest to [[Man|men]] except when taking a [[crap]].  However, it seems to be of great importance to [[Woman|women]].

Little is known about the precise relationship between women and toilet seats, but it seems that when a woman encounters a supposed incorrectly configured toilet seat she explodes, often doing significant damage to the surrounding area, potentially including your home, your toilet, [[your mom]] and [[you]].  She will then go online and [[bitch]] about this in her [[Livejournal]] (if she is young) or on [[Yahoo! Answers]] (if she is [[old|not]]). Some believe that this relationship between women and toilet seats has been created by [[Lifetime]], the television network otherwise known as [[Satan]]. Others blame it on Tim Allen and other [[unfunny]] comedians who took their own wives' neuroses and influenced other women to adopt them.

A man will see this and attempt a [[unfunny|humorous rebuttal]], which is completely wrong.  The correct response is in fact to [[cum|shoot the bitch in the face]]. Or you can be like [[Djbb]] and just piss with the toilet seat down, since it has a FUCKING HOLE IN IT.

Male [[trolls]] who like [[Violence|danger]] can try to pull off this argument on a [[Woman]] preemptively. This so-called first strike involves pulling the same [[shit]] in reverse, starting a fight because she left the toilet seat down. While this won't generate [[lulz]] for the man, it will however generate lulz and sympathy in unimaginable amounts from every other male on the planet.
