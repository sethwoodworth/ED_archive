The God Warrior
[[Image:TheGodWarrior.jpg|thumb|right|More like hamburger warrior, [[amirite]]?]]
<b>The God Warrior</b> (aka Marguerite "[[It's slowly coming this way!|Oh God, it's coming this way]]!" Perrin), is a [[Fat|plus-sized]] [[LoneWolf1984|batshit insane Christian]] psycho maniac who appeared on an episode of Faux reality TV show, Trading Spouses, back in 2005. During the episode, Marguerite switches homes with a family who are "New Age humanists", who have items such as "TAROT CORDS", "GARGILES" and other "DORKSIDED" objects around the house. Upon learning this, she begins acting out by throwing up, shouting erratically, praying, and being the typical [[inbred|Christian]] that she is, she attempts to convert the other family to Christianity. When the other father attempts to enlighten her on their views, she refuses to listen.

Once returning home, Marguerite ([[Victim complex|having been traumatized by her entire ordeal]]) literally fucking implodes on her own family, tears up the prize money, rants about [[shit nobody cares about]] and unknowingly sets off a record amount of [[lulz]] both [[IRL]] and on [[the internets]]. Of course, being the greedy bitch that she is, she later accepts the prize money, despite having "GIVIN IT UP TO GOD" earlier in the program. Her excuse, that she would use it for a bypass surgery, was a lie as the money will be gone the next time she visits her local [[eating disorder|McDonald's drive-through]].

==Dead Daughter==

In September of 2007, Marguerite's righteous indignation was addressed when her decidedly un-God Warrior daughter Ashely was killed in a car accident. As she was a heathen, Ashley managed to squirt out a kid prior to her death. It is confirmed that Marguerite will use the tragedy to raise the child as a God Warrior, using [[Nikki Catsouras|vivid imagery]] the tragedy of her mothers death as motivation.
