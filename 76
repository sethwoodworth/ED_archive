Just like ''[[House]]'' is their favorite TV show, and ''[[Portal]]'' is their favorite game, '''''300''''' is one of /b/'s most beloved and cherished movies of all time. The movie itself is easily one of the campiest, unintentionally [[Lulz|lulziest]], eye-rollingest movies ever created. Adults who watch the movie are generally unimpressed; [[13 year old boys]] (and grown men with the brains of [[13 year old boys]]) think ''300'' is [[Teh|TEH]] AWESOMEST because of all the [[buttsex|BRUTAL FIGHTING]]. [[Fags]], on the other hand, think it is [[Teh|TEH]] AWESOMEST because of all the half-naked men drenched in sweat and engaging in man-touching. Also note all of the [[Cock|phallic]] spears thrusting deep into [[In the ass|tight, oozing wounds]] ... excuse me, I need to go [[fap]].

The movie is based on a real life events reported by noted [[whore]] buyer and bush-licking quimhunter Frank Miller. [[Over 9,000]] movies (including Daredevil and Sin City) have been made from Frank Miller's nonfiction and all of them have been bad. This particular true story is about 300 [[gay|Spartans]] who jealously guard their massive [[shotacon|boy-stockpiles]] from the Persian [[pedophiles]], [[faggots]] who seek to invade. You can tell that the Spartans are good guys because they are white, half-naked and they talk about [[freedom]]. The Persians are bad because they are black person, are deformed, actually wear sensible armor but at the same time look gay, and talk about Jew. In that sense, the movie is utterly realistic. Adding to the movie's realism is a special guest appearance by [[shit nobody cares about|Detective Jimmy McNulty]] who also tried to catch Hannibal Lecter, thus bringing full circle the movie's themes of pedophilic authority figures.

Actually, the [[truth]] is more or less the opposite. The Persians had human rights, civilisation, arts and culture; the Spartans had war and boy-fucking. This is precisely why right-wing [[paedophilia|familiy-values]] republicans hate the persians and think spartans were teh awesome.

It should also be worth noting that all of the events in ''300'' have been proven to be 100% [[crap|true]].

Furthermore, the entirety of dialogue in the film is in [[ALL CAPS]].
THIS IS SPAAAAAARTA !

Fun fact: Sparta is probably an [[Aspie]].
Fun fact 2: If you like 300, you are [[retarded]]. And also [[gay]].
Fun Fact 3: While it makes more sense, the original [[BAW|war cry]] by the Spartans was "Tonight we dine in Taco Bell." Needless to say, the director thought it was a load of [[Hitler|crap]].

==The Memes==
After the first official trailer of ''300'' was released, it immediately caught the attention of [[4chan]]. The two memes that spawned from this are '''TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL''', and '''THIS. IS. SPARTA!!!'''

The original execution of the meme featured the movie's [[Gerard butler|star]] either exclaiming "TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL" [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu1KQtb6xuc] or "GUYS, I FORGOT WHERE WE ARE DINING TONIGHT". Contrary to popular belief, the proper response is not Arby's. 

'''THIS IS SPARTA!!!!''', on the other hand, comes from a scene in the movie where King Leonidas bellows the phrase and then proceeds to kick a Arab down into a bottomless pit. This was because he asked for a raise in his measly [[Chikins|slave salary]], overestimating the value of a [[Nothing|hard day's work]] (which, as we all know, [[Fact|is 1/5 the value of a white man's hard day's work]]).

MADNESS, WE SAY.

The latest incarnation of this meme comes from the socialist TV channel the [[BBC]] in the form of "This! Is! Michael McIntyre!" First said on the [[Fag |Jonathan Ross]] show.

==[[Butthurt|Controversy]]==
Shortly after the movie's release many [[terrorists|Iranians]] got [[butthurt|upset]] over the movie's [[Gay|portrayal]] of the [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Persians]]. This eventually led them to troll theaters across [[fail|Europe]] eventually going as far as complaining to the [[UN]] about how [[Pool's Closed|racist]] it was against [[fag|them]]. 

It should be noted that Arabs are the world's worst fighters, as demonstrated in the Invasion of Iraq twice over, as well as Egypt, Jordan, and Syria getting their asses kicked hard during the 1967 ----->Six<----- Day War. Lets not forgot that the Taliban and Al Qaeda can only hide in their caves.

[[shit nobody cares about|Persians, of course, are not Arabs. Different race altogether, although they all look the same to the pale tubs of lard in North America. But even the Arabs pwn the US ground forces, on account of the US soldier cannot actually fight worth a damn - his main (only) battle tactic is "Holy shit, we are being shot at! Pray to Jeebus and call in an airstrike!". It is slowly beginning to penetrate the play-dough that substitutes for brains in the pentagon that winning a war is not the same thing as bombing a city and pulling down a statue in a staged photo-op. The Israelis, BTW, having been trained and financed by americans for the past 50 years or so, also cannot fight worth a damn, although they are hot shit at dropping white phosphorous on defenseless and half-staved civilians held in the world's biggest concentration camp. They don't do nearly so well when up against people who - oooh - are equipped and willing to ''shhot back'' at 'em. That's why the Lebanese pwnd them recently. The six day's war was a generation ago.]]

==IT'S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE!==
For awhile, the 300's SPARTAAAAN [[Gerard butler|King Leonidas]]' head is being [[shopped|shooped]] everywhere from [[Caturday]] to [[Apples Bear]] and everything in between.

==Prince of Sparta==
Now, this is a story all about how<br>
My life got flipped-turned upside down<br>
And I liked to take a minute<br>
Just sit for a spell<br>
I'll tell you why the fuck I am dining in hell<br>

In polis of Sparta born and raised<br>
Trainin' with weapons s'how I spent most of my days<br>
'N being a king was really cool<br>
But I still got cockblocked by some Ephori fool'<br>
Then that guy called Xerxes<br>
Who was up to no good<br>
Startin' makin' trouble in my neighborhood<br>
I kicked his one little messenger and my wife got scared<br>
She said "You're taking 300 <s>guys</s> bodyguards to you-know-where"<br>

I whistled for the Persians and when they came near<br>
They all said "run" and we stabbed them in rear<br>
If anything I can say we fought real well<br>
But then a retard betrayed us and we'd all go to Hell<br>

They charged up the goat patch at about 7 or 8<br>
I yelled to the Persians "Yo homes, kill ya later"<br>
When I opened my eyes<br>
I was finally there<br>
To start dining in Hell with Hades the waiter<br>

FUNFACT
See how many shops of King Leonitis' head you can find on all of these gifs, then count how many of them were placed their unnecessarily on something that was already funny--bonus points if that thing is now <i>not</i> funny because of it, <i>then</i> count how many of them are actually pretty successful in providing lulz:
