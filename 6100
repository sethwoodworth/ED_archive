'''Otto Baxter''' is a 21-year-old [[Britfag]] with [[Down Syndrome]] who has made his life's goal to lose his [[virginity]] and [[Chris-chan|go on a fuck quest]]. He has been in the [[media]] before, but now he has traveled to [[America]] to further his attempt at not [[dying alone|dying a virgin]] and as of late, /[[b]]/ decided that his cause needed to be fulfilled. His mother, Lucy, who also has [[LOL WUT|three other adopted sons]] with [[tard|Down's]], is supporting him on his quest.

He first appeared in the [[old media]] across a great many news sites like the [[BBC]], ''[[tabloid|Daily Fail]]'', and [[shit nobody cares about|''Natalie Cassidy's Real Britain'']], among others. From this, we learn that he has dated other girls with the same condition as him (something [[CWC]] would not be willing to do), but they needed too much attention from their carers and so he was dating down; we know he could do better.

As it is, Otto Baxter is a keen [[drama]]tician, being an actor in [[Old media|Shakespearean plays]]. He certainly gets out a lot.

{{quote|Even this downs guy, with all of his weirdness, is still more talented, productive, likable and normal than [[Chris-chan]] will ever be. This retard probably does more in the space of an hour than CWC even thinks of doing in a month. A Shakespearean actor? Come on, Chris can't even make a YouTube video that is semi-watchable. And this guy can play in Macbeth. Fuck, I would donate the 60 eurofag dollars to get downs boy laid before I would even give CWC the time of day. Kudos to his mom for not letting him be a slag retard who feeds off the system and kudos to him for being a retard of win.|--Fuckingstupid 22:26, 17 March 2009 (UTC)}}

{{quote|Yes, but when you read the article you see that his stepmom has a whole different approach to her mongoloid son than Chris's mom. This mom doesn't raise her son to be a victim but to take matters in to his own hands, get out a lot, meet friends, go to a normal school, go out, etc. She just doesn't place him behind a PS3 in front of the internets. Also, his mom is trying to get her mongo laid.|Sagechu 09:41, 18 March 2009 (UTC)}}

==Otto breaks America==
Otto went with his mate from England, who has a [[girlfriend]], to Las Vegas in America. [[Seeking]] [[secks]] and [[lulz]], Otto was only too pleased to report on what he encountered in a strip club:

{{quote|"They pin me on the wall," he says. "They kiss me right on the neck. I unbutton my shirt. It feels very nice. I had a girl. She was on my willy. She jumped on my willy. It's wicked. It feels nice. I have a huge boner. Straight up. It feels lovely. Yep. I want to do it again. She also put her boobs in my face. One of the strippers grabbed my glasses and put them on her nipple. 'Are you naughty?' 'Oh, yes, I'm very naughty.' 'Come on, big boy! Let's take it down to your trousers! Unfasten your belt and let me pull it down and suck on it!'"}}

{{quote|"I like their boobs," he continues. "Yeah. Lovely nipples. Perfect breasts. They're like chicken breasts."}}

This [[shit|invigorating]] story led /b/ to help Otto's cause, setting up a website in his name, which can be found below. 


== His Mom Does What?! ==



His mother is [[serious business|serious]] when it comes to her [[fail|pride and joy]] trying to get laid. She takes it so seriously, in fact, that she is thinking about [[lolwut|hiring a whore for him]]. She has also stated that he would rather be with someone who, unlike himself, doesn't have Down's Syndrome.  Maybe he's not so different from [[CWC]] after all.

{{quote|"Will anyone sleep with my Down's syndrome son?"|No}}

{{quote|"What, are you fucking kidding me? I watched this downsfag smoking pole in an alley off East California in Oklahoma City. He wants the mancock."|Chickenfucker}}
