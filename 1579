{{lj|user=chuckmoulton}} is now an [[insane]] 27 year old whose involved in many [[alpha geek|leader ship roles]] with Pennsylvania's [[libertarian|libertarian party]] and now lives [[Unbirthing|inside his mother's cunt]].

He is a very [[lonely]], sad young man who is in love with a girl named [[pnaomi]] (he wants to put it [[in the ass]]). Their love goes back as far as middle school, when, in a plot twist worthy of an [[animu|anime]], Naomi punched Chuck, thus starting his decades long attraction to her.

In 2003, Chuck drove from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Seattle]] to [[Canada]] to get Naomi's [[cat]]. He then updated his journal with the story of the entire journey, including the total money he spent driving such long distances. 

Over the next few weeks, Chuck appeared many times on [[LJDrama]] and began to alienate many of his friends. 

In 2004, Chuck attempted to run for state Congress, but lost. Due to his Congressional bid, Chuck privated all of his posts about Naomi and began to defriend and not friend [[trolls]].
