The Heirophant Council
[[Image:Phantfag.jpg|right|thumb|Typical 'Phant]]
'''The Heirophant Council''' was a Marilyn Manson forum where each user is supposed to pretend to be interesting, which they clearly are not, to increase their post count & earn [[e-penis|reputation points]].  Most of the posts consist of "lol" or shitty poetry that only a [[goth]]fag could write.  They also have a section labeled Hate Anthems where they whine about how their parents grounded them, their girlfriends dumped them, or the standard "fuck the world" thread.  The essence of pure teenage angst flows through you as the page loads and you scroll through the inane dribble they come up with.  Most of the threads are blatant forgery, pathetic attempts by 20 year old pseudointellectuals to make the 14 year old inhabitants of the board [[lol]], and made up stories for positive rep points or [[attention]].

This forum being dedicated to Marilyn Manson already makes it [[fail]], but the majority of the members aren't even into this music, these people are sexual predators who feel that Manson's fanbase is a good target for finding disenfranchised preteens who will blow anything with a pulse that is wearing mascara and a "Kill Your God" t-shirt.

==Breakdown of Users==
'''Normal User''' - These are the [[fags]] who generally post stories of how they get beaten up at school for being a goth and listening to Marilyn Manson.  They generally stick to the General Chat and Hate Anthems sections because they know little or nothing at all about the artist they have dedicated their life to blowing.

'''Senior Members''' - It doesn't matter how many [[e-penis|reputation points]] you have, it doesn't even matter how large your [[e-penis|post count]] is to be a Senior Member.  You must suck the correct cock in order to join this special club.  [[TheAmazingAtheist]] is in this club proving it is chock full o' [[fail]].  These Senior Members are generally seen making fun of n00bs and trying to be [[funny]]. They're the only ones who have the extra sensory powers to detect those nameless neg reppers and it appears to their control panel automatically. Kinda like a peeping tom through a cunt full of hair.

'''Admins/Moderators''' - If you make fun of a mod or admin on this site, they will strike you with their [[banhammer]] usually giving them a strong sense of sexual excitement.  These are the cocks to suck if you want to become a Senior Member.  They usually consist of [[IRL]] losers who think that because they have power on a small-time internet forum they are 1337. They're also the equivalent of Manson's hated jocks who beat down punk-ass fuckers like road kill without a care in the world. Now that the Phant has been shutdown, they feel stark raving naked without their Senior Member and status quo to feel better about themselves than the rest. They're Chris Jericho's fave scourge of heel hypocritical parasite tapeworms who pander to the Senior Members pre-occupied with their massive egos the size of a jackhammer dildo hybrid. They also share the same massive egos the size of Vince McMahon's steroid filled body and cock with it... 

Further more, their artistic "talent," viewed outside of an so-called "elite" message board community, is now seen as mediocre and uninspired, unlike the unprovoked artists they attacked. 

'''Nameless Neg Reppers''' - They're the equivalent of back alley masked faceless thugs who beat anyone down in the dark of night when no one's watching.

==Death==
On Friday, June 19, The Heirophant Council was assassinated via sex murder. All moderators were found with a large amount of semen inside their lungs, and it is believed that they were killed through forced oral sex. Feces was also found at the crime scene.

'''BREAKING NEWS''':
Contrary to popular rumors, the moderators and administrators were not killed by watching The Signal, but by being sexually assaulted and killed by Lewis Denton/ A. J. Bowen himself. Another possible cause of death is that the database MansonUSA became self-aware, and in a minute of decay, became disgusted with itself, destroyed itself, and inserted semen into the mods and admins lungs for good measure.

Judgment Day has come to cyberspace. Unfortunately, John Connor doesn't want assholes or abusive robotic admins/mods to be saved from the terminators. So, instead, the machines took care of the rest of the pathetic admins/Seniors to their doom in Skynet concentration camps where they'll be converted into mindless, abusive machines based on their personas of what they did to the rest of humanity.
