'''Cripples''', also known as '''"wheeltards"''' and '''"chairfags"''', are useless wheelchair people who refuse to die. They have big, cumbersome, [[User:Hoveround|ugly wheelchairs]] that they use to run over your toe and get away with it, using the power of sympathy.  The only thing that gets more sympathy is [[dog]]s - there's no lulz like watching the aftermath of a motor wheelchair running into a dog, the Dutch animal ambulance boring into the crowd with sirens wailing as the cripple and dog owner start arguing louder and louder... [[At least 100 years ago| Until the Nineteenth Century]], people assumed that people born crippled were also [[b|evil]]---'a twisted body makes a twisted mind'.  This is of course true, but fades into insignificance before the greater and eternal truth that a twisted body is goddamn ''[[hilarious]]''.

* [[House|Pseudo-Cripples]]: These people use crutches, canes, and other devices, because they are not yet crippled enough to use a full-blown wheelchair.
* Regular Cripples aka "Paraplegics": These are your standard, run-of-the-mill cripples who, for one reason or another (usually spinal cord damage from ''not wearing a fucking seatbelt''), have to get around in a big, stupid chair with wheels on it.
* [[Christopher Reeve|Super Cripples]] aka "Quadriplegics": These are the ultimate cripples. They can't move anything below their neck, so they are stuck in special electronic wheelchairs that use [[Linux]]. They are totally dependent and they want to kill unborn babies and eat their stem cells, to [[fail|try]] and undo the hilarious punishment [[God]] has placed upon them.
* {{youtube|rRmiN-40OPE|Bullshit Cripples}}: These are, arguably, the funniest kinds of cripples. They are not disabled, they're just [[:Template:fat|really fucking fat]] and have given up on even the most basic forms of exercise, yet often collect [[welfare]] benefits for it anyway. Sometimes you may see these horrifyingly [[obese]] hambeasts riding electric carts in supermarkets. Be wary of approaching these vehicles too closely, lest you be devoured by the occupant.
* [[Crips|Nigger Cripples]]: These cripples roam the streets of [[Los Angeles]] with a pronounced limp from being born with a [[GRIDS|genetic defect]] that led to the formation of club feet. "[[Crips]]", as they are known, have a keen sense of direction and are generally friendly towards white people in luxury cars, looking for directions.
* [[Argent009|Hardcore Cripples]]: This kind of cripple actually enjoys the handicap of being [[drunk|legless]]. Often referring to themselves as [[lulz|"handycapable"]], they frequently [[Chris Benoit|fly off the handle]] when talked down to (although stooping to their level and kneeling infuriates them, even more) and will try and [[murder|run you over]]. This cripple is [[SFB|serious fucking business]] and should be handled with kid gloves.
* Lycanthrocripple: A cripple who, for some reason or another, regularly regains the use of their legs for a short period of time. Can be attributed to MS, muscular dystrophy, or being bitten by a rabid cripple.

== Cripple Mannerisms ==
Cripples don't want help from anyone and, much like women, like to live in their fantasy worlds of independence. But when they end up having to face insurmountable challenges, like turning on a ceiling fan, going up a flight of stairs, or masturbating, they throw a hissy fit and start going on about "equal access" and whatnot. Which brings us to the one and only reason [[God]] makes people crippled: to make able-bodied people's lives easier. After all, without the cripples' constant complaining, we wouldn't have those roomy bathroom stalls, conveniently-located parking spaces, or those cool stair-lift things that they use. But that doesn't excuse them from being annoying pussies who go on and on about wanting to be treated like everyone else, until they get to board the airline first.

== Cripples And The Internet ==
Needless to say, the [[Internet]] attracts lots of cripples. The reason, of course, being that it is their only form of social interaction, because nobody talks to them, IRL. Cripples are one of the many groups that are ruining the Internet by clogging our tubes with lame support group forums and online petitions for putting wheelchair ramps in front of every fucking building in the world. [[Argent009|Internet cripples]] are frequently [[Internet tough guys]].

== Ways to Troll Cripples ==

[[Image:Spidermansacripple.gif|thumb|right|What is it with superheroes and cripples?]]

* Ride on the back of their chair like you would a shopping cart.
* Buy them tap-dancing shoes and [[Lollerskates|roller skates]] for Christmas.
* Push them down the stairs.
* Loosen the nuts on the wheels.
* Stick safety pins in their legs when they aren't looking and see how many you can get in there, before they notice.
* Argue about [[Shit nobody cares about|stem cell research]].
* Inform them that the opposite of Christopher Reeve is Christopher Walken.
* Take them on a skiing trip.
* If they are gay, call them "Roll-AIDS."
* Instigate a "CRIPPLE FIGHT."
* Cripple them some more.
* If they say, 'I'm not handicapped!' answer, 'You mean you'd be this useless even if you weren't crippled?'
* Ask if they've learned to give really good [[head]] now that they can't do [[fuck| anything else]].
* If they say, 'I'm handi-capable,' just fucking kill them---many other cripples will thank you for this...lamely.
