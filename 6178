==WARNING:SCI-SPIES!==
'''As posted from another site where an anonymous talks to an ex-OSA member. Be very careful people.'''

"I've been following this very closely - can't wait to see what happens on Feb 10. I wouldn't put it past them, but they won't be able to get someone
to every raid. There are OSA HQs in Florida and L.A., so those locations will be in the most danger of being infiltrated. Smaller protests, not likely. OSA wouldn't trust anyone but real insiders with that task.

Protection from this: don't have a non-speaking, silent protest, as is being discussed. Most OSA infiltrators stand out like FBI agents at Defcon, if you know what to look for.

Actually, your biggest danger is *not* that they'll try to incite violence, but that they'll send in a private investigator to go hang out with you guys afterwards, pretend to be one of you and wait for you to take your masks off. I noticed no one's talking about this on the boards. Can you please pass this info around? OSA doesn't want you arrested yet. They want to know who you are. Won't be hard for him/her to take pictures of you all, either, since everyone's bringing a camera.

'''Protection from this: Only leave the protests with long-time friends. If you have to leave the protest with an Anon you have just met, don't take your masks off in front of each other."'''

{{notice|[[PROTIP]]: '''If you ever want a Scientologist to [[GTFO]], and they are lower than [[Sysop|OT3]], tell them the [[Xenu story]]. Even better, wear a huge placard or large sign with the Xenu story printed on it, or have someone dress in a [[furry|Xenu alien costume]]. They are not 'allowed' to hear the Xenu story until they've paid over $250,000, so by Scifag 'law' they have to leave the vicinity.}}

Also, Scifags like to take photos of people who speak out against them to add to their [[CP|creepy database]]. As a countermeasure, film them back, or bring along pocket mirrors, like those that you put in your locker or that are sold in army surplus stores. When they try to take photos of you, simply catch the sunlight with the mirror and reflect it at them. In theory, the attacking Scientologist ''should'' turn to dust; at the very least, anyway, the glare will fuck up their photos. Alternately, if it's foggy or dark, use an LED flashlight for the same effect. DO '''NOT''' CHARGE (OR USE) YOUR LAZORS, they will cry BAWWWWW I'm blind now and someone will put you in the cooler.'''

If you're a female and a Scifag tries to pick a fight with you cry rape real loud. Scifag stormtroopers look like child molesters anyway, meaning near by civilians and police will take your word over theirs. This helps if your being tailed by them in a car. Call 911, say you're being stalked and when the cops pull them over and see their sketch books with license plate numbers and other crazy crap written on them. 

*'''[[PROTIP]]: Reading news reports about the preliminary IRL protests, the SciFags they quote ''always'' say something about "they suppport free expression, but are deeply concerned about ''hate speech''" etc. I propose that there be signs at the IRL raids to counter this pre-emptively, e.g. "Truth is not hate speech" or "Dianetics = hate speech" or something more clever that you could think of.'''

*'''Get educated before you go protesting:

{{notice|'''[[PROTIP]]''' ''With ED, Partyvan, forums.enturbulation.org, Facebook, and miscellaneous /b/s and /i/s, it's easy to get yourself lost when it comes to finding the most current information on your local raid. Chances are there IS an event near you, and there ARE people involved.

irc.partyvan.org is a very well structured, well established system. ALL changes, plans, and strategies are first heard of there. Any questions or concerns you have are also best brought up there.

Join irc.partyvan.org, and go to the channels #irl, #xenu and #v. Follow the instructions these channels have to offer to get to the channel for your local raid.

This is the BEST way of eliminating any confusion you may have, and the best way of doing some group-planning before the 10th.''}}

'''What kind of Craziness to Expect!'''
{{ytplus|Observe the Technique scientologists use to piss you off|<center><youtube>pPol_m8wm8Y</youtube></center>| Be ready. This is how a real Scientologist reacts to critics. Keep your cool. Don't give into the dark side.}}

{{ytplus|This is "Bullbaiting", where they yell in your face|<center><youtube>nfTMka5JQqE</youtube></center>|Resist the urge to use the Fist of Death. Instead. offer them a breath  mint.}}
''PROTIP'': Wear headphones to drown out screaming cult members.

Section 4 of Project Chanology takes the raid out into Real Life.
A standard operation procedure[http://partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology/Operations#Section_4:_IRL_Raids] of the raids has been posted on Project Chanology.
