Time Magazine
[[Image:Time-magazine-elephant.jpg|thumb|[[furry|Typical Time Magazine cover]].]]
'''Time Magazine''' is a [[uncyclopedia|staggeringly boring]] attempt by the [[old media]] to make presidential [[bullshit]] interesting. Instead, they spend half of their time talking about arts, fashion, and general [[crap]] so that people will buy their magazine, even if it's just to wipe their asses on. ''Time'' is very [[Family Guy|self-referential]], spending at least 12 hours every day writing a story about how [[bullshit|"influential"]] its stories are. The magazine itself rarely has a decent article, the last one being in [[At least 100 years ago|1991]].

== Time = [[marcabs]]. ==
[[image:cultofgreed.jpg|thumb|[[Scientology|The cover in question.]]]]
Before internets existed, ''Time'' wrote the first truthful article about [[Scientology]], calling it the "thriving cult of greed and power." This is quite lulzy, because the [[old media]] rarely covers the cult, due to [[butthurt]] from many Scifags. It ended up as the cover story, which is even lulzier. Needless to say, the writers were thoroughly [[rape|raep'd]] by the [[OSA]] and their legal team. Nonetheless, the article went out, but because it was in Time Magazine, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972865-1,00.html no one actually read it.]

== Time and [[JewTube]] ==
[[Image:Time-YouTube.jpg|thumb|Oh God no.]]
In 2006, the person of the year was [[you]]. That's because of JewTube's raep of the internets, which made [[Web 2.0]] officially [[shit]]. However, ''Time'''s faggy editors decided to suck the viral [[cock]] of both their [[fucktard|readers]] and the [[Rupert Murdoch|final bosses of the internets]], so they wrote a bullshit million-page story about [[lonelygirl15|fatasses with webcams]]. Dumbshits flocked to YouTube, making it permanently shitty.

The cover featured a [[gay|Mac]], and a [[USI|mirror was glued onto where the computer screen would be.]] This caused many [[liberals]] and [[old people]] to piss themselves in [[fag|delight]]. The rest of the magazine fucking sucked, and instead of featuring JewTube stars, they just interviewed a bunch of dumbshits nobody cares about. Way to fuck up the internets.

== [[Moot]] is a Faggot ==
[[Last Thursday]], (srsly), [[Moot]] was interviewed by ''Time'' in a one-page story about [[4chan]]. The article itself was truthful, pretty much talking about how [[lolcats]] were stolen from Anon and how [[lulz|"4chan is a horrible place."]] Still, it's another shitty attempt by ''Time'' to appeal to the TOTALLY RADICAL YOUNG AUDIENCES, and another attempt by moot to Jew Many [[rules of the internet|god-fearing /b/tards]] went batshit at the sight of this article. Needless to say, an abnormal influx of [[faggotry]] appeared in the vast caves of 4chonz, fucking up yet another part of the internets for good. moot also claimed [[spam]]mers don't come to 4chan, despite the fact that sites like [[Anontalk.com]] spam every thread at least once.

It is also in this article (and another one by the ''[[beurocratic fuck|Wall Street Journal]]'') that [[Moot]] reveals his [[IRL]] name. He tells ''Time Magazine'' that it is Christopher [[Pool's Closed|Poole]]. However, /b/tards speculate that moot is being a giant [[troll]], as Christopher Poole stands for [[CP]], [[Habbo|Closed Pool]], etc. A [[Google]] search for Christopher Poole yields only a faggy photographer, some weird-ass directories, and other shit [[you|I]] didn't feel like looking at. So moot's real identity still remains [[It is a mystery|a mystery]].

== The Greatest Trolling Known to Man ==

[[IRL]] the reason moot was on the list of 100 Most Importants was because he was the [[winnar]] of the [[online]] vote. Seemingly unbeknownst to all, the vote was indeed [[hackers on steroids|hacked by hackers of hackery]]. The result lies below, an image that will make you [[shit brix]] at its implications. TIME, one of the most iconic magazines of the now, was insidiously trolled for gr[[ae]]t justice.
