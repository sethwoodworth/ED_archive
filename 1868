''This article is about the online game Crossfire. For the gay chat app, see [[xfire]].''

Crossfire is an online free-to-play massive shooter game made in some Vietnamese homebrew shack made by incapable 16-year-old for noob 16-year-olds. The framerates are ridiculously low and CS Source and graphics are on par with the latest in computer gaming, Counter-Strike 1.6!

== Noobs Everywhere ==

In Crossfire, practically all players are either noobs, fair play noobs (so-called forumers), children or girl gamers posting on the forums in all pink. There are many reasons for becoming noob in this game. Excerpt of possible reasons for being noob:

*lucker
*sprayer
*croucher
*bullet-dodger
*backside-killer
*lowpinger
*highpinger
*lagger
*hacker
*waller
*chammer
*aimbotter
*wallhacker
*reloadkill
*textkill
*lolkill

All of these things can make you NOOB. So .. don't forget to liberally spread these words in spam fashion in the game rooms.

== Fair Play ==
That is a big one in Crossfire. The fair play noobs faction in Crossfire as well as ESL creeps have their own place to hide out and battle with the most cheap guns, they ONLY ones, which they deem pro-worthy: Echo Server, channel 8. So be sure to come by and offend the local fair play-aholics.

== Nice Things to Know ==

*The forums are moderated by a mutant noob guy named Saladin.
*Don't forget to look SPOPs and STAR characters under their hood for a big bonar, err, bonuses.
*Don't forget to join a clan with an offensive name, like III Reich or similar.
*You can circument the - again, CHEAP - swear words filter by putting dots into your beloved word.
*Don't forget to call people "hack", "kick" or "reported" when they make double kills or, even worse, TRIPLE kills.
*You can bind spam messages onto the F5, F6, F7 and F8 keys under Options, tab "Community". Ironic, isn't it?

== Offensive Words ==

*kick XY
*hack, hek, hak, haker
*XY reported
*XY gay farmer noob
*learn to play
*use a real gun
*off that noob gun
*lets get on 1v1 ESL, you up to it noob?
