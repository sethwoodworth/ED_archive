Doutaini

[[Image:Fatskinnedcat.jpg|thumb|Projected appearance of the average Doutaini member.]]
'''Doutaini''' is a haven for some of the most disgusting filth to ever inhabit the interweb. Every member of this [[wolf]] [[Online Roleplaying|roleplaying]] website is 100% guaranteed to be a [[furry]], [[basement-dweller|basement-dwelling]], [[wapanese]] [[16-year-old girl|teen girl]] [[wolfaboo]] just bursting with [[beastiality|repressed urges]]. They, as you can deduce, enact these [[beastiality|fantasies]] upon the graphic-overloaded shitpile that is Doutaini. These [[pathetic|upstanding]] [[losers|young adults]] produce more drama than a [[Deviantart]] furry collective, which makes for some smooth, easy trolling.

==Doutaini: The Legend==
As mentioned earlier, Doutaini is a [[roleplay]] site. A roleplay site based around sup3r pow3rful [[wiccan|elemental]] [[wolfaboo|wolves]]. There were originally six 'elements': [[Avatar the Last Airbender|wind, water, lightening, air, earth, and ice]]. However, the number of packs expanded because the admins needed more 'alpha' positions for their friends to occupy in order to make them feel special. Characters become more powerful based on [[internet money|points]] that they suck one another's flaccid dicks for.  

==Drama, Drama, Drama==
As expected from an all-female haven for [[antisocial]] closet zoophiles, Doutaini contains piles upon piles of [[drama]]. Its pathetic, possibly obese userbase manages to snap out of [[fantasy|level 100 fantasy-land]] long enough to band together like gaggles of malformed toads and form [[cliques]]. Unlike the cliques of real life, however, every member of each Doutaini clique (along with every member of Doutaini) is an utter [[loser]]. These groups of misfits fight over a [[lie|wide array]] of topics, such as whose character is the [[wapanese|'smexiest']] and which element is the most powerful. Even small arguments tend to escalate into massive [[flame war|flame wars]] that result in admin-changes, bans, and [[do it faggot|threatened quittings]]. Whenever a flame war begins, the most common insult is '[[immature]]', which is like the pot calling the kettle black. Most of the drama takes place upon the livechat, where the most [[obese|dedicated]] members of Doutaini gather to suck each other's proverbial dicks and [[dying alone|brag about the sex they've never had]]. Of course, self-proclaimed 'Doutainians' are too busy typing out meticulous wolf sex scenes to notice that everything that's so important to them on that shithole of a site means absolutely nothing in reality.

==Character Requirements==
As bad as Doutaini is, the requirements for joining are quite strict. In order for your character to be noticed at all, it must:
*Be a [[mary-sue|'badass']] player with a hot temper and a penchant for fighting (if male)
*Be a [[mary-sue|'sultry']] seductress who trusts nobody (if female)
*Have a ridiculously [[shoop|over-photoshopped]] profile picture and a billion postscripts
*Be typed out in a style that annoyingly disregards many grammatical and punctuational conventions (all for the sake of being 'experimental')
*Come from a [[worthless|'prominent family']]
*Be [[beastiality|smexy]] (this is the most important part!!!)
Remember that these people are writing about WOLVES.

==Notable Members==
Although every member of Doutaini is a [[fugly]] harpy, some members are bigger harpies than the rest.
*[[trying too hard|Olly]]- although Olly hasn't been a member of Doutaini for as long as many of the other notable members, her ferocious dick-sucking has allowed her to rise up as Doutaini's main admin regardless of the fact that her [[suethor|mary-suism]] cannot be matched by even the prepubescent roleplayers on Neopets. Her writing is unremarkable, while her characters are remarkable only in the fact that they are incredibly annoying. Luckily for the [[sick fuck|good people]] at Doutaini, admin turnover is so high that she'll probably quit in a few months after one of the members' routine revolts.
*[[annoying|Kam/Tam/Whatever-am]]- while the years pass by, the '-am' members of this softcore beastiality site seem to remain 13-years-old. They are incredibly annoying, forming alliances with the flavor of the month on livechat and adding to the drama flame without ever starting something.
[[Image:Sab.jpg|thumb|If Doutaini had an awards for 'biggest ego', 'most ragequits', and 'highest weight', 'Brina' would win all three.]]
*[[unwarranted self-importance|Sabrina]]- Sabrina is a teen girl filled with an unprecedented ego (which is remarkable on a forum filled with massive egos). She loves to fill the General Discussion with pictures of her ugly mug, creates characters who are as pompous as her, and has rage-quit the site many a time. Her re-joinings are forewarnings of admin changes, as she unfailingly creates huge shitstorms upon her arrival.
*[[sad|Jo-Jo]]- while Jo-Jo is one of the most [[dead|dedicated]] members of Doutaini, she seldom gets recognition because her writing isn't as [[trying too hard|'artistic']] as everybody else's. She probably remains on Doutaini because she has nowhere else to go.

==Trolling==
Trolling Doutaini is initially very easy, but an influx of trolls could lead a site closing thanks to their [[lame|application process]]. Because of this, the best way to troll this [[troll bait|incredibly troll-worthy]] institution is to take it slow. While infiltrating a site that is basically beastiality at work may sound painful, the end reward may be well-worth it. Here are some tips for massively trolling Doutaini:
*Join with a character whose last name is Valentine, Naibu, Domine, Eins, or Alberaq and tell everybody that your character has no relation to any of the other characters on Doutaini
*Integrate yourself into the site and suck the current admin's cock until the next admin change. Get a position and [[delete fucking everything]]
*Create an extremely detailed profile and roleplay with [[netspeak]]
*Join with legitimate-sounding characters and make them [[rape|try to have sex with everybody they meet]]
*Suggest that [[closet furry|roleplaying wolves]] automatically makes you a furry or zoophile 
*Join with a legitimate-sounding character and introduce yourself cheerily on the front page as a zoophile or wolf fetishist 
*Spam the Doutaini [[Facebook]] page

==Reaction to the Article==
[[Image:Olly.jpg|left|thumb|Olly wants to ban this article.]]
Upon discovering this article, the [[retards|really cool members]] of Doutaini threw a [[bawwwww|fit]] on the boards, calling the creator of the article [[irony|immature and moaning that ED editors have too much time on their hands]]. They seemingly missed the fact that Encyclopedia Dramatica exists to document [[drama]], and they are [[fat|bursting to the seams with it]]. In typical Doutaini fashion, some of them [[dramatic|'became sick']] upon reading the article and fantasized about what they'd do to the editor if they know who he/she was. Predictably, they decided that [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|blanking the article]] or replacing it with pro-Doutaini content was a [[lol|great idea and would totally work]]. Luckily for everybody else, the morons were too stupid and/or lazy to read ED's editing rules and realize that article vandalism doesn't work. Here are some mind-numbingly stupid quotes from their editing attempts.

|WE CAN TROLL TOO!
love, Doutaini
p.s. suck our large furry wolf dick. we love it.|[[user:Tinklebelle|Tinklebelle]] reveals that she [[DOING IT WRONG|does not understand what trolling means]] while admitting that Doutaini members are indeed furries and possibly [[dickgirls]].
|Doutaini is a haven for some of the most amazing people to ever inhabit the interweb. Every member of this wolf roleplaying website is 100% guaranteed to be an awesome, cool person just bursting with inspiration. These cool people produce better writing than a bestselling author. The site's owners are especially wonderful people.| The 'bestselling author' in reference is [[Stephanie Meyer]], and even that's a huge stretch.
|KLJSKJSLDHSKJDHSKDJSHDKJ| [[user:StarFruit|StarFruit]] gets creative with her vandalism.

These examples of Doutaini-generated [[faggotry]] are proof that the place is in need of [[rape|a harder trolling]].
