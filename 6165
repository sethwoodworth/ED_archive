''The police have powers under Article 23A of the Public Order (NI) Order 1987 to require the removal of any disguises.  Failure to comply with such a request is an offence.  In essence my advice to you is to ensure that no attempts are made to disguise the identity of persons taking part in your protest.
 
The type of protest you are suggesting does not fall within the provisions of the Public Processions (NI) Act 1998 therefore you are not required to provide written notification as required by Section 6(2) of that Act, provided there is no intention to form a procession to or from the place of protest.
 
You have a democratic right to protest which is protected under the Human Rights Act.  However, you should take the time to learn your rights and responsibilities when organising a public event.  Protests can be effected by police powers and standards of public order.
 
The legislation governing protests of this nature in Northern Ireland is the Public Order (NI) Order 1987. Specifically:

The major public order offences of riot, affray.
    
Use of Words or Behaviour or Display of written material Art 9. This refers to using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or displaying any written material which is threatening, abusive or insulting.
    
Provocative conduct in a public place or at a public meeting or procession Art 19.  This refers to using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour or displaying anything with intent to provoke a breach of the peace.

I would suggest that you liaise directly with the Police Events Planning team at Strandtown Police station prior to the event you are planning on 15 March 2008 to ensure no problems arise on the day.

So to summarize: no masks. =(
*not no masks, under that act, only the POLICE have the power to ask us to remove masks. Therefore, Masks. If scientology tell us to remove them, tell 'em to shove it up their respective ass, if the PSNI do we have to do it =)
