Crossmack
[[Image:Crossmack.jpg|thumb|right|210px|lol dongs.]]
[[Crossmack]], or '''Ian Crossland''' is a moderately prominent [[YouTube]] person, [[e-psychiatrist]] nonpareil, professional actor, and e-philosopher who understands "'''THE POWER OF ONLINE VIDEO COMMUNICATION'''". [[All_caps|Ian]] is prone to philosophizing about any topic imaginable, from Jesus's half-black ancestry to the future of online communication: connecting to the internet with our [[All_caps|MINDS]]. His drug-induced ramblings are amusing to watch while basking in the afterglow of just having jacked off, as [[All_caps|Ian]] believes himself on par with the greatest existentialist intellectuals of the 19th century, despite the fact that he's nothing but a [[All_caps|drug-addled hippie with an ego the size of Montana]]. Ian admits that the [[United States]] is a [[macrocosm]] of a single person ([[PROTIP]]: look up "macrocosm"). Ultimately, it is assumed that Crossmack is the 21st century digital '''sybok''' jesus christ-neo.

Ian Crossland graduated from Kent State University with a B.A. in theatre in 2001. Some of Ian’s favorite roles have been [[furfag|Matt]] in The Marriage of Bette and Boo, [[fag|Laertes]] in Hamlet, [[fag|Wallace]] in Women and Wallace, and [[nigra|DJ Vince Fontaine]] in [[theater|Grease]]. Ian has performed with director Ronan Marra before, appearing in his last production, Off the Hook. Some other shows Ian has performed in are Life Is a Dream, Dial “M” for Murder, Twelfth Night, Macbeth, City of Angels, and Scapin.

Of course none of THAT measures up to dressing up in [[transvestite|drag]] for the role of 'Vera', [[amirite]]?

==Woar Crimes==
[[Image:Crossmackbringslight.jpg|thumb|right|The Bringer Of Light]]

Crossmack has violated the Geneva Conventions dozens of times so far and seems unlikely to refrain from doing this in the future. Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council has failed to take action. Some of Crossmack's worst crimes against humanity include:

* Psychoanalyzing [[User:Wattage]], a respected [[war]] hero
* Comparing himself to [[Stephen Colbert]] and giving him comedy advice, [http://www.searchmyvideo.com/watch/3108219754/message-to-stephen-colbert/ as seen here]
* Telling his [[girlfriend]] that he wants an open relationship, after which she started freaking out. Actually, that was pretty lulzy.
* Being a [[drugs|stoner]] and arguing about stonerism on the internets
* Borderline [[hippy|hippyism]] of the sort that would make John Lennon blush
* Probably a bunch of other stuff perpetrated during the short portion of each day when he is not [[attention whore|filming himself]]
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kpYgIM0Djg&eurl= The most incredible e-psychiatry you will ever see in your fucking life]
* {{youtube|TiPsJuCYlhA| Okay, nevermind, this is more incredible, lol}}
* [[Domestic violence|Being hit by his girlfriend]]

==Dealing with Crossmack==
If you are a [[troll]] and are confronted by Crossmack, immediately claim that your behavior is somewhow the result of your parents' divorce, apologize for everything you have done, and profess your undying friendship to him as well as your newfound dedication to the One World Movement. Later, hit on his scorned girlfriend, [[lol]].

==CrossMackian Theory==
===Crossmack on Jesus===
Crossmack has been known to have an extreme hatred of Jesus and religion. Asking Crossmack about any religious topic on stickam results in a long, pot-induced rant about how religion is just sun worship and how the truth is relative and how Jesus was just a man who conned people into believing he was God; you know, typical pseudo-intellectual pothead rambling. 

Crossmack's claims about Jesus:
*Jesus was half-black
*Jesus was a stoner and was constantly high on mushrooms and cannabis (despite the fact that neither grow in the harsh, arid climate of the Negev Desert)
*Jesus was an "extremist"
*Jesus' story was ripped off by people who wanted to make money by being burned and tortured by Nero in pagan Rome.
*Jesus = every pagan god crucified, despite the fact that crucifixion is one of the most common forms of capital punishment in ancient cultures (some modern cultures even do it for shits and giggles).
*Jesus = Horus (Crossmack calls Horus "Horus Ra" which is a misnomer since Ra was the only Ra there was) because the movie Zeitgeist said so, despite the fact that Horus, unlike Jesus, was the product of incest, had sex with his own mother, and after being crucified was chopped into pieces that were then spread along the nile.

==Crossmack reacts to Movie==
The aforementioned video successfully managed to [[troll]] Reverend Crossmack. After viewing it, Ian posted two videos where he discussed reality and macrocosms, then he [[Flounce|revealed that he was planning to leave]] [[YouTube]] and [[delete]] his videos as the Crossmack Movie had made him incredibly upset and [[ButtHurt]].

{{quote|I gotta stop making these videos... I watched Ian Crossland The Movie and it was like, me being all [[stoned]]. Ian Crossland The Movie is about a guy, this stoner, [[lie|that's not me.]] }}
