'''Is it Ghostbusters 2?''' was a [[forced meme]] perpetuated by [[British]] comedian [[Troll|Iain Lee]] through [[2006]] and [[2007]]. The meme/troll consisted of calling up [[AIDS|Early-morning/late-night call-in game shows]] and providing the [[Golden shower|golden answer]]: ''Is it Ghostbusters 2?''.

The shows are presented by the [[prostitutes|cream of Z-list presenters]] who have nothing better to do in their non-existant careers than to pander to [[basement dwelling]] [[faggots]] to obtain their phone [[jew Gold|monies]]. The meme has had mixed [[Win|success]] although it has generated some [[lulz]]. 

So far the correct answer has not been Ghostbusters 2.
