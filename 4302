[[Image:Proof2.JPG|thumb|Moar Proof of [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=30694738 Jessica Lyn Dickerson's] true faggotry.]]

In late [[2006]] a representative of [[Bantown]], through pure chance, came across Jessica Lynn Dickerson, an unfortunate soul on [[Myspace]]. This poor [[retard]] had been brainwashed by [[bible|Jesus fanfic]] and [[Fred Phelps]] into believing that [[God]] really does hate [[fag]]s. Thus said noble [[white knight]] resolved that it was duty to help her through her struggle to come out of the closet, as that is the only way she could truly be happy.

For [[at least 100 years]] this user pondered as to the best way to help poor Jessica Lynn Dickerson. "I know!", exclaimed [[Bantown]], "I'll post a link to the [[BayHorseCrew]] article to EVERYONE on her friends list!". And so it was done with [http://www.myspace.com/Bantownian this profile] using the [[Bantown]] cookie monster as a picture and the display name [[An Hero]]. The cookie monster later became a [[meme]] with Jessica Lynn Dickerson's friends.

[[Bantown]] was not surprised to see that many of her friends were extremely pissed off to receive this message but nevertheless carried on through the accusations of not having Jessica's best interests at heart. [[At least 100]] of them removed her from their friends list, including [[BayHorseCrew]]. The messages received are posted in this [[article]] so that Jessica may reflect on who her real [[friends]] and just how conditional some of her supposed friendships are.

==The Message==
I feel that I must alert you to the fact of Jessica Lyn Dickerson's predicament. I feel that she has been given a difficult path in life and needs your support. I recently came across this message on http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/BayHorseCrew by typing Jessica's name and was quite alarmed that in this day and age this situation is still occurring. I am not doing this to hurt Jessica and am in fact a concerned friend of hers who wants her to feel comforable being herself. Please give her all the love and support you can in this difficult journey she is facing.

Again, please be aware that I am in no way homophobic and am in fact doing this to help Jessica. If you have any questions or concerns feel free to message me through MySpace or talk to ED IRC to which a link is supplied on my page.

Love a concerned friend.

Hey, so I read your bulletin and I wanted to send you a message. I don't want to come across as insesitive but I really feel you are dealing with a greater spiritual struggle. I mean you are a HUGE threat to the Devil and his plan (what, you've got like some unheard number of souls won for Christ, right?) and I believe he is doing what he can to get you confused and off God's track. And I'm not asying this as someone sitting back with her arms crossed looking at everyone else's struggles besides her own, but I say this to you as one who has also struggled with the issue of homosexuality. I tell you this in complete confidence as I have only ever shared that with one other person, who was also in your same situation. But what I can tell you from my own experience is that heterosexuality is a discipline choice just like choosing to wait to have sex till marriage, or choosing not to have a few drinks when the world tells you it's okay, or any other struggle we Christians face. And the more one quenches those feelings and temptations the easier it becomes to stay away from it. Just like a recovering alcoholic or cigarette smoker is going to be continuously tempted by thoughts and opportunities to "have just one," or how my roomate and her boyfriend will be tempted to get a little more intimate during this season before they are married, you and I will also have to face temptations to think of a girl friend in a way that may not be appropriate, or temptations to find comradery in a girl who is available to feed our emotions the way guys can't. But it just comes down to how we all handle those temptations. Just because you have those feelings or thoughts or whatever it is that makes you feel you must be lesbian, does not mean that you are. More heterosexual women than care to announce, deal with those same thoughts and feelings, obviously some more thatn others. But the truth is that most women, regardless of orientation, experience these things. And that's mostly because women have greater emotional needs than men. That's just a fact. And often, it is easier to just find satisfaction in allowing another woman (or the thought of another woman) to be what you need because she likely knows what you need and knows how to provide that. There is also the physical issue as well. You may feel the male body just can't excite you or please you sexually, but i promise you... there is ONE male body out there that will, and (aside from Jesus) there is ONE male person who can be all you need emotonally and spiritually as well. I know the things that can go through your mind. I fell I've had to address them all myself at one point, but it is just a matter of what you do with all of it. You can choose to go with your surface feelings or you can resist them and lock into the incomparable satisfaction there is in giving them all to Christ and letting Him do what he will with them.

I am 23 and have never been in a serious relationship because I have committed to wait for "The One." And I have committed to let "The One" be a man : ) I know he's coming but it has definitely been a struggle to maintain purity of mind in ALL respects. Only the past 6 months or so have I been able to look to Jesus to satisfy all my needs. We all know He can handle our spiritual needs if we let him, but believe it or not, he has been able to satisfy my emotional needs and even physical needs by supernaturally supressing urges to act impurely. I feel closer to him than I have ever been in my 10 years of being a Christian because while I am waiting for Him to bring my husband along, he has been truely romancing me in every way and I can say now that I am totaly in love with Him and he is my BEST Friend.

I don't know if any of this helps or hurts but regardless of whether or not you agree with me, I still hold you with the same amount of love as I did before and the equal amount of respect. I mean, you're my HERO! I know we've only hung out a few times but you have always inspired me to gather the boldness you have and take it to the streets to conquer the world for Christ.

I would really love to talk more with you if you'd like. Just message me or give me a call (removed by ED). Until then, you'll be faithfully in my prayers.

In His love, Jessica

How dare you send this to me...you have no right to subject anyone to this type of humiliation! I admire Jessica in every possible way and admire her even more for being open with her struggles! She is as awesome woman of faith and I would highly urge you to remove this trash as soon as possible! I feel more deeply sorry for you that you have to focus on someone else's issues instead of dealing with your own! Please be advised that Jessica has a lot of friends and a lot of people who love her...I mean truly love her regardless of mistakes, so this will not do anything to waiver that love....and by the way, posting a humiliating message on myspace is not by any means a sign of love! She made no mistake by sending an awesome message of encouragement like this, but you are wrong to send this...I will pray that you seek truth and remove this! Jessica is awesome and I support her...she is not wrong for being open...the only thing that would be wrong would be her walking around in a facad acting like she doesn't have problems....I admire her and love her as a best friend...and I feel sorry for you that you cannot appreciate someone like that!

ok so i know jess...but i am confused on what all of this means....

please let me know why you sent this to me

([[Bantown]]'s reply):

I sent it to all her friends because she clearly needs help with everything she's going through.

28 Dec 2006, 05:14 PM

i dont think that is what she is talkin about at all...she says that she is WAITIN for a man...

and to be comp honest with you...if she was havin struggles with her sexuality it has nothing to do with you and i ALSO think that it would humiliate her...u putting her business out there. i think you should perhaps mind your own business and if it has nothing to do with you...stay out of it...bc she may or may not be struggling-but even is she is-it is soooooooo wrong for you to put her business out there...

([[Bantown]]'s reply):

This is a quote from the letter "And I'm not asying this as someone sitting back with her arms crossed looking at everyone else's struggles besides her own, but I say this to you as one who has also struggled with the issue of homosexuality." It is homosexuality that she is dealing with if you read it closely and visit the website it was obtained from.

It is my business as I care about her and don't want her to suffer through the loneliness this will bring on without support. She needs help to deal with her issues and her friends, like you, can give that.

28 Dec 2006, 05:28 PM

and i understand that you are concerned for her...but brodcastin her news out for all of her friends to see i think is wrong....

that is wrong.

if you wanted to get her friends to support her-all you could have said was please pray for her...not air all of her damn news out there.

is she even aware that you did this?

do you know how humiliated she is goin to be when she finds out that you have done this???


and she also says in her note...right after the "back with her arms crossed looking " part......she says "I tell you this in complete confidence as I have only ever shared that with one other person"...

she is goin to be soooooo humilated when she finds out you put her business out there...


she obv wanted no one to know...

what you have done is sooooo wrong.

([[Bantown]]'s reply):

She may be embarrassed but sometimes you have to confront these things, like when people have interventions. In order to get her friends to pray for her I had to tell them somehow so I did it through MySpace. Yes, she does need people to pray for her.

28 Dec 2006, 06:26 PM 

i just think what you did is sooooo wrong. you had nooooo reason to put her business out there.

What in the world?

([[Bantown]]'s reply):

I thought you should know, please be supportive so she doesn't have to suffer like this anymore. 

28 Dec 2006, 05:06 PM

but i am still confused...what is she goin through?

([[Bantown]]'s reply):

It says it in the message and the website I found it on, she's struggling with her sexuality.

28 Dec 2006, 05:06 PM

This seems to be more malicious than loving. And you must be crazy to think that doing something of this nature is helpful rather than harmful. Do you not realize how you just completely disregarded her privacy? You are not God; do not take it upon yourself to out someone in such a disrespectful and common manner, without their consent.
I do not know you, your circumstance, or your connection to Jessica, but this seems very, very wrong.

It may just be that you are concerned about a friend, however, this concern needs to be between you and the Lord, not publicized to others. Walking in obedience includes not spreading gossip onto others. If this was a concern of your own about yourself, it would be acceptable, yet it isn't, which classifies it as gossip. We need to be very careful when dealing with these types of situations because they can cause us to fall in our walk and it can hurt not only us, but more importantly, the person we are concerned about. "Prayer Chains" are not good to conduct because they will keep our prayers from being answered. God is not a God that should be mocked, He can do anything and everything, so long as you believe it in your heart. I'm sure that through your own battles, that someone didn't go and spill the beans about your personal life to others. I realize that you located information about this person somewhere and that you may feel it should be spread abroad, but it shouldn't be. Believe in God to accomplish ALL things through Jesus and everything will be okay, lean not upon your own understandings, but upon those that are of God. Your prayers will be more powerful if you keep them between you and the Lord. Please understand that these words are for edification, not condemnation. Jesus loves us all. God Bless.

You have no right to do this.
I would rather struggle with something and tell someone IN CONFIDENCE to help them than to slander their name all over the place.

I dont know who you are, but im sure thats a plus. Because you are not even a suggestion of what a real person is.

Have fun trying to sleep at night.

look
I don't know who the hell you are
but Jessica Sczhec (spelling) is not gay or lesbian or whatever
she had a hacker go in and screw up her page
and if you would have read the comments people left you would have known that
so how about you find out the facts before you go sending mass e-mails like that
Jessica is a really good friend of mine and I know see is right with the Lord and doesn't let sin get into her life
so... please re send an e-mail telling people you don't know what you are talking about ok?!?!
thanks!!!!!!!!!!

hi fuck head
i dont know who you are nor am i close minded about sexual orientation however i know my cousin and that is not her talking. even if she didnt trust me with the knowledge of her orientation, i still know her well enough to know her belief in the lord is not impure. if you continue to send me messages slandering a person of which has never indicated any poor judgement in my opinion, i will find you and you will not be pleased with the out come of our next conversation.

30 Dec 2006, 08:15 PM

i think that thet fact that you sent this out to Jessica's friends is horrific and you have completely betrayed her personal ife. i almost said betrayed her trust, but you obviously "found" this. this was not something that she came to you with in confidence. we all have our struggles. i am in no way condoning this type of life and i think it's good that she has chosen to stay pure and follow God. i can't even imagine how i would feel if someone found out something about me and sent it to all of my friends. i hurt for her right now, but not for the reasons that you are trying to present. i feel awful that she has a "friend" who would spread such gossip in the name of "our friend needs prayer." she is obviously already dealing with this and is trsuting God. if she wanted her friends to know she would have come to us personally. it is not your place to do this. if you feel you need to pray for her, then pray for her, i will. but please stop sharing very intimate personal information with the world that is not your business to share.

someone should pray for you to shut your mouth. because you don't know and i don't know and no one else knows for sure it is her, and if it is true and she wanted people to know she would tell them. and as God views it you urge to gossip is just as equal of a sin for her supposid homosexuality.

sounds like you both might be screwed then.

i really hope that you are truly a concerned friend, because i love jessica & respect her immensely and do NOT understand your motives. she is dealing with her issue the correct way, by leaning on GOD. how do you think posting this for the world to see is doing her any good? does she know you did this? why do you think she needs any help, it sounds to me like she is dealing just fine without anyone who has a myspace reading about her struggle. do you want your personal struggles with your flesh posted in a bulletin? if so, make sure to send them to me & i will put them out there. boy, i really hope you are really her friend. i am a christian who in the past has had same sex relationships and i am so glad Jesus healed my mind from that. i am now married & have 2 kids. as much as i don't care who knows this, the difference is that I am the one putting it out there. not someone else. who are you?
