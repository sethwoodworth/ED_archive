The ''<b>Microsoft Xbox</b>'', AKA the ''ecks bawks'', ''[[Chris Chan|HEX BAWX]]'', ''DirectXbox'', and ''Microsofts greedy attempt to make more money'', was Microsoft's first attempt at making a video game console. While being the most powerful of the 4 consoles released in its generation, it was also known as the console most likely to catch fire and burn your house down, most likely to scratch discs when you weren't even moving the thing while it was on, and least likely to get any of that mentioned in the press due to Microsoft's $500,000,000 war chest (read loss leader) for console supremacy. 

For a while it was also the most capable console for online play while also costing too damn much to play online, as well as harboring the most retarded online gaming community of [[13 year old boy|sqeakers]], fratboys, and niggers ever unleashed on the poor world: [[Xbox Live]]. It is this that has given the Xbox so many fanboys and just as many [[Sony Defense Force|anti-fanboys]].

==History==
Back in 1998, console gaming was starting to be noticed a bit more, and [[Microsoft]] was starting to notice how bad [[PC]] gaming was losing to console gaming. More people were starting to play video games, and Microsoft obviously needed to make more money. You know, because obviously [[Windows]] wasn't [[sarcasm|making them enough money already]]. So they foisted the WinCE "operating system" on [[Sega]] to get a few [[shit|bad]] Windows titles onto the otherwise great [[Dreamcast]], pull a little money in for themselves, and get a bit of education about consoles. But this still wasn't enough, no, they wanted their own gaming system. So in 2001, they released the Microsoft Xbox. Originally, the launch title was going to be a game called Malice, but it was switched to [[Halo]]: Combat Evolved, because even the most hardcore Halo haters would admit that they would rather play as some cyborg dude blasting aliens then as a little girl with a mallet. This decision was wise, as Halo: Combat Evolved was the only thing ('cept the $500,000,000 loss leader) that saved Microsoft's ass from becoming like Sega at the time. As the xbox got more games, it got more support from people and became popular across the globe, except [[Japan]], because you know, obviously they won't play anything that isn't an RPG, [[pathetic|dating sim]], or anything Nintendo [[wii|shoves down their throats]]. Eventually, Microsoft knocked [[Nintendo]] out of 2nd place and competed with the Playstation 2 in a battle of epic proportions, temporarily leaving Nintendo behind in the dust.

==Memorable Games==
''Some of these games have prequels on the Dreamcast. See [[Dreamcast#Memorable_Games|this section]] on the Dreamcast article.''

Here are some of the most memorable games the xbox had to offer. Feel free to add any.

* ''<b>Blinx the Time Sweeper</b>'' - Basically you play as this [[furry]] who can gain [[EXTREME]] VCR styled time control powers by killing these monster thingies.
* ''<b>Halo 1 and 2</b>'' - Possibly the 2 most overrated games on the Xbox. However if you ask a NORMAL Xbox Live player about them, they will tell you that those two games are the best games ever made.
* ''<b>JSRF: JetSetRadioFuture</b>'' - A sequel to its predecessor <i>Jet Grind Radio</i> on the Dreamcast (JSRF has bigger maps and some great graphics, but [[lame]]r play and music, too many parts relying on not being able to see stuff to make it hard, and as a sequel, naturally lacked the original's [[OMG|wow]] appeal). This game's fanbase claims that it is the most underrated and unheard of game on the Xbox, [[lie|which is fucking bullshit because the game was bundled with the Xbox on Christmas 2002.]] Ever wanted to skate around and break the law while somehow managing to beat the shit out of police officers just by spraying them with spray cans? Now you can!
* ''<b>Mech Assault</b>'' - Basically, the whole incredibly simplistic plot in a nutshell is that you've landed on a planet with 2 other people, whose only purpose is to annoy the fuck out of you. You must destroy the [[Bad_Dudes|evil dudes]] on this planet and you must destroy their orbital guns before they "[[all caps|OMG KILL US ALL]]".
* ''<b>Shenmue II</b>'' - This game was the <s>first</s> second video game made by gooks and continues Ryo's ridiculous quest to not move on with his life and kill the asshole who killed his Father. [[Shit nobody cares about|Was originally released on Dreamcast]].
*''<b>Drake Of The 99 Dragons</b>'' - [[sarcasm|A really incredible game that changed the way we as humans experience joy. It had the greatest control system which made the move stick the same as the camera so you had a challenging time seeing and running.]] Oh, and they planned on making a comic book based on it, but it was [[cool_guy|too fucking good]] to waste time letting people read it's great story.  [[lie|This game alone made most of the money Bill Gates has.]]

[[Duke Nukem Forever]] was supposed to be on Xbox.  However, the company working on it happened to be located in [[shit|Texas]], the game turned into a series of livestock [[Rape|raping]] missions.

==Internal Structure==
On the outside, the Xbox looks like a gaming console. But if you take a look inside, you'll notice that inside it's ironically the thing Microsoft DIDN'T want it to be, a PC. It had a motherboard, a CD-ROM drive, a hard drive, almost EVERYTHING a normal PC had. Because of this amazingly ironic mistake Microsoft made, [[Linux]] [[fags]] [[I_Came|jizzed]] [[Stick_It_In_Her_Pooper|all over the place]] [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|rejoicing at how easy it was to hack the Xbox and put their favorite shitty operating system over it, no mod chips needed. Out of all the gaming consoles of that generation, the Xbox was probably the easiest to hack because of it's ironic design.]]

[[Image:Xbox_on_tractor.jpg|thumb|Turning on your Xbox will shut down the power to half of the state you live in.]]
[[Image:XBOXCONTROL.jpg|thumb|Some users also took issue with its modestly heavier game controller.]]

==Meme Status==
Lets face it. The Xbox console itself if pretty fucking big. It's so huge that the only known console that is bigger than an Xbox is the Atari 5200. The epic size of the Xbox landed itself a meme probably originating from [[4chan]] called "XBOX HUEG". This meme was usually used to tell just how "HUEG" an item was. However, ever since the Xbox's younger brother, the Xbox 360 hit the market, the meme officially became old and outdated, since the only thing HUEG about the 360 is it's ridiculously over sized power cord, which is more of it's own joke.

==Nigras and the Xbox==

If you were stupid enough to subscribe to Microsoft's shitty and laggy Xbox Live membership, you'd instantly notice how many nigras are present online. The fucking ''Halo 2'' servers are dominated by these mother fuckers who roam around with extremely deep and raspy, annoying, voices and they sound like they're choking every time they laugh because of their shitty 99 cent store Xbox headsets. Studies of this strange phenomenon suggest that blacks are attracted to these Xboxs due to the fact their size and color remind them of their womminz fat black asses. If you encounter one of these people, you will notice how they will love to talk about the west coast, say the word "fuck" at least 20 times (motherfucker counts too), and how their insults vary from their white counterparts. The typical white insult is "[[faggot]]", while the typical black insult involves dicks and shoving things up an ass. At least they [[gay|have something in common]], right?

==Xbox Live Back in the Day  (The original service is now [[Bill Gates | dead]])==
''For Xbox Live as it is now, see [[Xbox Live]]''

Surprisingly before the service got a huge facelift with the 360, it had the same retarded community as it does now, only a bit smaller. Except instead of playing <s>[[Halo 3]], [[Call of Duty 4]], [[Street Fighter]] IV, [[Grand Theft Auto IV]], [[Gears of War]] 2</s> [[Modern Warfare 2]], they could be found playing [[Halo 2]], [[Call of Duty|Call of Duty: Finest Hour]], [[Shit nobody cares about |and a fuckton of sports games.]] Don't believe me? This video should clear all doubts you have:
