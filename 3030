'''Forever Alone Guy''' (Also known as '''F.A.G.''') is [[at least 100|one of many, many]] unfunny, forced variations of [[rage]]-comics, created somewhere around April 2010. The stories are usually focused around main character with abnormally swollen face, which expresses loneliness and disappointment with his life ([[Emo|in which he is alone]]). Some of them also includes wannabe-funny word games with main line, which has nothing to do with actual plot. Next to highly overused RAGE, FA also draws its [[unfunny|humor]] from such phenomenons like [[Trollface]], [[FUCK YEA]] or [[Poker Face]], and can be easily replaced by almost any of them. 

As it usually goes with this kind of [[shit|art]], the plot never thickens and after [[over 9000]] attempts of making [[lolz]] out of it, you flush the stuff down the toilet.

Most important question you ask yourself every fucking time you go through FA: [[fail|why the hell is the guy with a swollen face smiling?]] 

==Origin==

[[Shit nobody cares about|Not much is known about FA origin, as “Rage Guy” mutations have been flooding on not only 4chan, but also Tumblr, FunnyJunk, and many other memetic dumpsters for quite a while. Some argue that this is the lamest and most unfunny meme evar; but everyone knows newfags have no bounds for creating unoriginal, unfunny bullshit. Even during the memes creation last thursdays, every oldfag on /b/ despised it and made spoofs featuring MS Paint mock ups (which exposed how little talent and thought was put into FA).]]
