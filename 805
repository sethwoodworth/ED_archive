Badfic
Badfics exist as the [[internet disease|poison]] of the Internets, written by bewildered [[basement-dweller|fans]] in hopes that others will marvel over their [[Nobody gives a shit|miniscule]] attempts to create an [[Plagiarism|original scene]] from their favorite [[annie may]] or some [[shit]]. Although many fanfics predictably [[fail]] because of their poor writing and [[shit|mediocrity]], [[404|one can actually find]] a good fanfic but only in [[Never|rare instances]].

While [[some argue]] the term "badfic" is superfluous because all fanfic is badfic, [[Squirrelking]] and [[Peter Chimaera]] prove otherwise.

==Boring Historical Details==
[[At least 100]] years ago, [[over 9000|numerous]] fanfics have been written featuring anything from [[yaoi]] to [[furries]] to...aw, hell...[[fail|yaoi]] and [[AIDS|furries.]] Fans who show a great [[sex|interest]] in their favorite shows can go as far as to combine two series or more for a [[fanfic]], thus giving birth to either an [[retard|abomination]] of no redeeming quality or something that is actually worthy of [[lulz]].
