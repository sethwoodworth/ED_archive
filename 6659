Prussian Blue
[[Image:Prussianblue.jpg|thumb|A pair of Afro-Semites]]
'''Prussian Blue''' is the singing duo of Lynx and Lamb Gaede (pronounced ''[[homosexual|gay]]-dee''), trailer-trash [[Nazi]] [[loli]]s who sing folksy and heart-warming tunes about [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jews]] and the historical inaccuracy of the [[Holocaust]]. They are rumored to be the actual sire of pedobear. They are known for being so unoriginal that they rip off [http://www.prussianblue.net/TheStranger.mp3 verses from Rudyard Kipling], despite his having been neither a [[srsly|serious]] white supremacist nor particularly talented. [[Hitler]], according to [[Mein Kampf]], dreamed of a day when [[rape]]worthy preteen girls would come along and laud his praises. This is that day. They are the [[purelily|Aryan]] answer to the Olsen twins.

[[Truth|They were once referred to as "fantasy sweethearts" by a typical Nazi paedophile who at time was in prison for child molestation.]]

==Something Awful==
[[Image:Prussian_Blue_loli.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A moment of musical inspiration.]]
Prussian Blue once had a guestbook for other white supremacists to sign, until [[Something Awful]] featured them as an ALOD. Due to the overwhelming amount of free time that virtually all SA members have, the guestbook was shut down due to unprecedented amounts of Zionist and [[Black Jesus|nigger]]-loving spam. A second ALOD featured months later created further hassle for the band. SA has actually urged the [[murder]] of these girls, but since all SA members are secretly not human, merely [[furries|diseased animals]], nothing can be done about this, as they are under the protection of the Humane Society, and the last thing anyone wants to do is piss off environmentalists who have no qualms with blowing up fishing boats packed with humans in order to save some dolphins.

Also, much lulz will ensue when black person [[rapes|pwns]] the motherfucking shit out of these supremacist hoes. [[Noone|Who]] wouldn't like the whole country to perform sweet [[buttsecks]] on these two?

==LiveJournal==
The Gaede twins also had a brief career trolling [[LiveJournal]] under the moniker hitlersangels. It got suspended, and they resurfaced as hitlers_angels. After pissing off [http://amightypenguin.livejournal.com/14759.html Harry Potter slash queens], they got suspended again. They returned as aryanlolitas, only to be suspended and [[permaban]]ned a few hours later.

==Triangle Article==
The subject of [[Prussian Blue]] caused [[IRL]] drama on [[Drexel University|Drexel University's]] campus when an [http://www.thetriangle.org/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_id=d8790a84-d1d3-44c3-92d9-d0f83abf7191 article] that, among other things, called the [[Anti-Defamation League]] a "racist organization"  was published as an editorial in the student newspaper. 

On Prussian Blue:

{{Quote|Maybe the problem is the target audience and the people being used to try and recruit these young people to the same ideals shared by the white supremacists. There is a band, Prussian Blue, that is made up of two sweet-looking, cute, little blonde girls, Lamb and Lynx Gaede, and these 13-year-old twins are known as "the Olsen twins of white power." The name of the band is partly a reference to the color of [[Zyklon B]] residue, which "supposedly" wasn't found in the gas chambers, and the girls hope it might make people question "some of the inaccuracies of the 'Holocaust' myth." The Gaede twins complain about the fact that "smart white girls who have good eugenics are more interested in making money in a career or partying" instead of being wives and having "good-quality" white offspring. Although these views are certainly different, there is no reason that their words or music should be stifled. This is America, people.|Kurt Ritzman|color=black|size=300%}}  


Some newfag was quoted as responding with [[Shit nobody cares about|"The girls and their supporters intend to continue invoking the First Amendment whenever necessary, even though it doesn't say anything about the right to have people like you if you're a Nazi twat."]]  Predictably, no one cared, because everyone hates black person-lovers and realizes the invalidity of their opinions.
