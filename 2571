'''Earth''' ( also known as Terra, Teegeack, Erff or Urrf ) is the 3rd planet from the star Sol and is most notable for its ruler Fil. The Thriving population of [[over 9,000]] [[Humans]] and at least 100 [[Nigras]] who live on it. Earth is estimated by top [[Tom Cruise|scientists]] to be between 6,000 and 8,000 years old, created and built by Lord [[Xenu]]. Earth is home to many people that won't [[shut the fuck up]], and fucktards from [[4chan]]. Since [[Al Gore]] invented [[Global Warming]] and [[Nigras]] started to litter their [[condoms]] and Starbucks cups everywhere, it is often said that the Earth is doomed. However this is a stupid point as the sun will proceed to [[asplode]] in [[over 9,000]] years, thus rendering all [[Computers|human achievements]] pointless.

* '''MYTH''': The Earth is a sphere with a circumference of 24,900 miles and orbits the sun alongside 7 other planets. 	 	
'''FACT''': The latest [[Shit_no_one_cares_about|scientific research]] indicates that the Earth is the center of the universe and is actually a flat disk held up by four [[Elephants]] standing on the back of a massive [[Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles|turtle]]. Most importantly, it is [http://www.reformation.org/stationary-earth.html stationary] 	 

* '''MYTH''': The Earth is harmless. 	 	
'''FACT''': The Earth is mostly harmless.

* '''MYTH''': Humans are the only intelligent species in the solar system.	 	 
'''FACT''': There is no intelligent life on Earth. The last bastion of educated thought were the [[dinosaurs]], who were killed off by Lord [[Xenu]]. On that day, intelligent life as we know it disappeared. One look at any [[emo]] or [[liberal]] community on [[LiveJournal]] proves this.
	 
* '''MYTH''': The planets political state is controlled by a select group of humans.	 	 
'''FACT''': The planet is run by a race of reptilian aliens taking the form of [[W|World Leaders]].
	 
* '''MYTH''': The election of the new [[Pope]] will usher in a time of darkness for all to come.	 
'''FACT''': The election of the new [[Pope]] will usher in a time of darkness, but only because he looks like Darth Sidious from ''[[Star Wars]]''.

==The [[Creation|Creation]] Of Earth==
There are two theories circulating the [[interbutts]] regarding how the Earth was created, causing [[Some argue|much controversy]] on which one of them is true.
 
The first of these theories is that the Earth was created by [[Emptiness|nothing]] which magically exploded for no reason and created [[Universe|everything]]. This idea is an obvious [[lie]] and was first hypothesized by evil scientists such as [[Serial killer|Ted Bundy]] and [[Einstein|Albert Einstein]]. These people are the devil and simply want to lead [[Christians]] astray from God for the [[Lulz]].

For the true theory we merely have to look into our bible. Chapter 1 Genesis,

''In the beginning [[God]] created the [[Heaven|Heavens]] and the Earth.''

'Nuff fucking said, God did it. Science is the [[Devil]] and the [[Science Fiction|Bible]] is to be taken literally in every single way. Or you are going to [[DO NOT WANT|Hell]].

==End of the Story==
It is often thought that the world will end in 2012, mainly because some old calender finally finishes on that year...or something. In actuality, it will end when the U.S. and [http://www.freewebs.com/weamstherussians/mapsoftheworld.htm Russia] decide to stop arguing over who has the bigger dick and [[Final Solution|nuke us all]].
