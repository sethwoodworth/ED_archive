'''PeerGuardian''' is a program made by Phoenix labs designed to block the IPs of certain groups depending on lists that the user picks. It's most commonly used by wearers of [[paranoid|tinfoil hats]], [[pedophiles]] trying to evade being [[V&]], and [[skiddies]] who don't want the [[FBI|feeb]] to catch them with their [[1337]] h4x. 

== Pros and Cons ==

===Pros===
1. Stops the government from '''[[dox|h4xin yer dox]]'''<br>
2. Reduces your chance of being caught while you [[torrent]] the [[Metallica]] discography and all of [[DBZ]].<br>
3. Somewhat prevents you from getting spyware if you're to much of a [[retard|Luddite]] to get rid of IE.

===Cons===
1. If you're a [[13 year old boy]],or Simon Tessier, then you will in fact have to disable PeerGuardian to play [[Garry's Mod]], as it blocks steam servers.<br>
2. PeerGuardian will actually block its own update servers, and you will have to disable it to update. <br>
3. [[You]] have to have an IQ higher than room temperature to use PeerGuardian. <br>
4. [[Nerds|Windows 64-bit users]] would rather [[impossible|beat ''Battletoads'']] than run it on their computer. It's a [[Sarah Palin|bitch]]. So use [http://www.peerblock.com/ PeerBlock].

== Other Facts ==
PeerGuardian is [[Open Source]] and available on [[Linux]] so all you [[beard|neckbeards]] don't rage over proprietary software. <br>
It's also made for [[Mac]] so even [[faggots]] can have their [[stalker|privacy]].
