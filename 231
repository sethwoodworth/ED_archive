Administrators' noticeboard
{{potential}}

The '''Administrators' Noticeboard''' is one of the [[lulz]]iest pages on [[TOW]], and is the biggest [[epic]]entre of [[drama]] on the whole website. [[Wikipedia admins]], as the [[tautology|name suggests]], congregate there and hang out to engage in matters of extremely [[serious business]]. Since it is open for all to see, it can be a great [[sauce|source]] of amusing things for us at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] to make fun of, [[for great justice]].

The noticeboard is divided into the general noticeboard, and the noticeboard for 'incidents'. It is also ripe for [[trolling]] if you can convince them that you have a serious [[problem]] and cannot find help with it, but since the Wikipedo admins are getting [[moar]] and moar unable to [[assume good faith]], you'd better cover your tracks and do it very sensibly - just then, your trolling might result in an [[epic win]]. Wikifags are starting to block after one [[n00b|misguided]] edit now, whereas before they used to give you [[cocksucking|warning after warning]] and then apply the [[cock|block]].

==Types of [[drama]] that surface there==
*[[BLP]] violations.
*[[Legal]] issues.
*[[Edit war]]ring.
*[[Banned|Ban discussions]].
*Errors and people being [[DOING IT WRONG|unable]] to do things correctly, because TOW is [[fail]].
*Threats of [[school shooting]]s, which are always reported to the authorities, resulting in the [[party van]] arriving for the idiot who made the threat.
*And most importantly, various chronic trolls bitchslapping the world's largest repository of <s>knowledge</s> misinformation with [[IDIFTL|provoking crap]]. There is almost always a thread about Grawp or a WoW clone because some [[butthurt]] [[fag]] is [[pwnt]] with the [[MediaWiki]] title [[black]] list.
*WP:DRAMA redirects to the Incidents noticeboard. ya, srsly.
