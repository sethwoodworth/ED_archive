'''Stormdragonblue''' (alias '''prinnyjuice''', formerly known as '''Killythefox''', '''Stormdragonblue Cliassi''' on [[Second Life]]) has been a citizen of the internets for at least a decade. [[Some Argue]] that he is a perfectly good artist who has never went out of his way to harm anyone. Others, however, note that he is both a [[Diaperfur]] and a [[Rubberfur]], and is only capable of [[Sex|a stable relationship]] through a very specific combination of fetishes that only a few people on earth share. Of course, [[Internet|these days, that's no obstacle]]. Yet, for all his [[Furry Art|artistic talent]], he squanders his abilities on [[Sick Fuck|pointless wastes of time]].

== What makes him stand out, though? ==

== But Seriously ==
[[Image:Human_Stormy.png|thumb|Even when he animes himself, he draws himself fat.]]
This [[Basement Dweller|Timid Genius]] has been producing [[Shotacon|inspired artwork]] for years- even forgoing the inviting rays of the sun as he puts ink on paper. In a [[Lulz|tragic]] attempt to [[Manchild|cling onto his childhood]], he has only managed to drown himself in [[Fur Affinity|an ocean of depravity]]. Fortunately, he is considerate enough to share [[Insane|his ideas]] with the world.

For example:

{{quote|As she sits she gets suddenly dizzy... And her mind starts to feel like a whirlwind of thoughts and memories shooting by. She can feel the top of the costume slowly sliding down but is lost in her mind spinning.

The suit closes and everything goes dark. Suddenly it's as if nothing is there. She can't feel the suit anymore. She can't feel herself. No memories, no thoughts.. as if she wasn't there.. anywhere.

Suddenly her eyes [[Grammar Nazi| pop open hard]]. She pants and shakes her head. 2 Odd things on her head dangle along and slowly her eyes fall to her side as odd sensations fill her. She doesn't feel.. as a she anymore. All [[Transsexual|sh.. he]] can see is his Umbreon form. Sleek but [[Typo| all the seems]] clearly visible. Each light pad to the floor feels like an soft squish yet [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|sold]]. His mind is filled with new sensations and thoughts.}}

The technical precision brings tears to children's eyes.

== His Fans ==

That's right, even an [[pedophile|eccentric]] can have [[Chris Hansen|fans]] on the internet. This majestic navy [[FYIAD|Dragon]] has built up a small circle of viewers who [[Sockpuppet|give him the emotional support he needs]]. After all, [[Everybody|who needs constructive criticism]] when a pat on the back feels so much better?

== Stormy's Romantic Relationship ==

Romance? With such [[Infantilism|specific emotional needs]], and unusual [[Fetish|romantic preferences]], who could possibly give Mr. Dragon Blue the partner he needs? He has had some turbulence in the past, but now he has his soulmate. Behold Khany, a "3-year old" pink rubber tiger "girl". As Dr. Lectre would say, Kahny is not a true [[Transsexual]], so Stormy gets to have his little boy and eat it too. Of course, pictures mean more than words ever will:

D'aww.

{{frame|{{morphquote|mqtest3|background-color:#ffffff; width: 700px; height: 210px;|font-weight: bold;

|If I have to believe DA and FA page and actually put some meaning in page views, favs and comments it seems people also enjoy my artwork. That kind of metric isn't the kind of thing I want to use to show of popularity but it shows I'm not total crap ether otherwise nobody would bother to come back to my works. Sorry if this sounds page view whorish but I do believe feeling somewhat good about that isn't misplaced.

So all in all I feel I [[Pr0n|accomplished something]] in the Furry community. I'm nowhere the best artist ever but at the same time take pride in what I can manage with my skills and try to push that boundary up all the time and I feel good about that. I enjoy peoples praises and try to satisfy my own needs and blend it at times with what my commentators say. It makes for a fun blend.

[[Baw|Excuse me for showing any form of self esteem Furry fandom. Very sorry that I believe I might have a fan base.]] [[Unwarranted Self Importance|I will now push my head underground again like a artist is supposed to do in this fandom]].|Fur Affinity journal entry, June 2010

|For me my love from Transformation comes more or less from 3 key points. The first one goes way back to my pre-teen years. There was this children's story book. It had some pictures but mostly was meant as a story telling book. The story involved a boy being changed into a merman by a mermaid. That's at least the basic first part of the story. I can't remember the main plot but the entire "becoming a merman" stuck with me really hard. I would even wear pajama pants with just 1 leg to emulate the idea. I also know that it somehow got me worked up but even I don't know what actually triggered it in the first place. All i know is that there my love for mermaids/mermen comes from and aquatic types with finds or snake like ones. The 2nd involved a dream I had in 6th grade where i was turned into a bird. Interestingly to note is that i knew the change happened from a spell book. I desperately wanted to know the spell. I had the same dream again but was also not deep enough in my sleep to realize that I should focus on the book now that I had the chance. I looked at it and the pages had no words. Bummer :C The last one was the episode from TMNT and the creation of Mona Lisa. I swear that fascinated me so badly I got a mayor crush on her. The entire situation and her change was instant love. For the longest of times I had forgotten about how she looked and was even called. Nnot that long ago I came across it all again. It brought up a lot of fond memories.|Fur Affinity journal entry, November 2007, the day before he [[Cthulhu|became a Deep One]]
