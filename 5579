[[Image:TheKohser.jpg|thumb|"No, I'm not a pale-faced, four-eyed stoned nerd.  I'm a man with a baby girl and a church and a business and I'm going to retire by 46, by gosh!  ''Then'' I'll get these cheeto-colored beaver teeth replaced, dagnabbit!  I tell ya!  And that girl I call my own?  She won't be embarrassed by what she and her friends [[Google]] then!  The shit I do?  It's worth it beeyotches, and it makes me not want to blow my brains out over my piss boring life, so [[fuck you]]!"]]

'''MyWikiBiz''' is a site where [[attention whores]] and other entities with [[unwarranted self importance]] or that [[nobody]] gives any shit about can "author your own stinkin legacy." It's run by weirdo thekohser, who ran for election on the [[Bureaucratic fucks|Board of Trustees]] talking about how much Wikipedia sucks (he got my vote simply based on his 'wikipedia is shit, i and i alone will de-shititize it' platform). Gregory Kohs runs this shit of a "website" aka shitsite, he charges 100$ per shitty one paragraph biography he'll compose but only when he is 100%drunk, if it stays on wikipedia 30 days but he'll take 50$ anyways for his "efforts". Jewbo suspended this motherfucker, but that's ok, Kohs has 100's of other accounts "in good standings" Jewbo is not aware of.

== From the kohser to herr Greg Hoser ==
Actually, the dude was called "Greg Hoser" back in grade school, BUT NOW WE ALL REMEMBER WHY!  thekohser and mywikibiz are alone responsible--lay respect for re-pioneers!--for bring back the Gen-Xism "hoser".  It's been [[9,000]] generations since then, and [[retro]]-style only a hoser like thekohser could bring it back.  Greg Hoser, wait'll we get our Hanes on you!
 
== Give me churchin and give me networkin! ==
[[Image:PinkButt.jpg|thumb|250px|She wouldn't go on record when ED contacted the [[Fleshlight]] people, but she said this was the '''only item ordered under account #9899439, account name: "<big>thekohser</big>".''']]

The dude [[pope|talks up his church]], but only [[Raptor Jesus|crucifies Christ]] for coffers, his own.  Greg Hoser's all about contacts and being noticed.  He's the Paris Hilton of the Wiki World.  "Fuck you," he'd tell you if he heard that.  Why?  Not because it's not true, but because it's his dream...to be the [[Paris Hilton]] of the wiki world is the motor of his engine.  A goal; an ultimate.  

You know how if some [[old]] lady will die two days after her dog dies?  Well Greg Hoser will die two days after the day he believes he is the Paris Hilton of the Wiki World.  Thus, thehoser has ambition and disbelief.  He keeps trying to top himself, yet he has hosed his way to the top.  He is, truly, the Paris Hilton of the Wiki World.  But he'll keep on.  Because I tell you: if in two days you read a paid obit in some no-name newspaper in some no-name town in Pennsylvania, you'll know:  Greg Hoser read this and it dawned on him:  he is an embarrassment and has engaged in a years-long colossal and pointless waste of time.  He's dressed it up as a public service, but his wife only bought it once she found someone who lied his way through dating with "I'm a grow-er not a show-er."  Hoser things *he* is miserable, talk to the wife!

He wants to be looked at for whatever he can in the on-line world, because lord knows he's bored with his fucking [[Pennsylvania]] wife and his Pennsylvania life with a child that's not even his own sperm.  "Shit, how the ''fuck'' did I end up here?!"

No, that wasn't this article wondering how off track it got, it was this article quoting Greg Hoser beating off in the shower every single night after he tucks his chair in at his cubicle at his "Fortune 9000" company.

== Edible [[Durova]] underwear ==
Fucking hates sea hag [[Durova]], which is why we voted for him for the Board of Trustees!  And to say, "We hate fucking Wikipedia, vote for Greg Kohs!"  He got that vote a'ight.  But when he started selling edible black cherry-flavored panties with Lise [[Durova]]'s photos on the crotch, I was abouts to have me some!  I tell you.  The problem was, Greg Hoser's Cafe press site said 500 in stock now, but when I ordered two days later.  They was all out?  

Either Lise Durova is a hot black cherry of a girl, or somebody at MyWikiBiz is dippin' into the merchandise!  I ain't sayin' it's The Hoser - but... who else works in his organization?

==Account switching==
Thekohser managed to send many [[sockpuppet|checkusers]] completely insane by trading and switching accounts with [[Wikipedia Review|Awbrey]], the most known of the bunch being [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CBOrgatrope CBOrgatrope].
At the beginning of 2010, he [[EBay|traded]] an [[administrator]] account called Cool3, which originally belonged to someone else. 
All of this of course sparked a load of lulz.

== E-lawyer Gregory Kohs !Oh noes! ==

Over [[Slowpoke|9 months after it's creation]], this asshat finally found this page and proceeded to [[BAWWW]] at the mean things said about him on the internet.  After butthurt firmly set in he [[e-lawyer]]ed up in a pathetic attempt to [[censor]] this article, which [[noone]] on the planet Earth gave a rat's ass about (until now). Good job, genius.  

This [[douche]] then proceeded to [[delete fucking everything]] and threaten to [[lolsuit|sic his legal Jews]], cause, you know, ''that's'' gonna make the [[trolls]] go away.

OH NOES?

Noes.  

Good luck with that, bro.  Maybe you should have gone through the proper channels like a grownup.  

{{q|
Some kid has protected [[MyWikiBiz]] in a libellous version. I have consulted my lawyer and according to the law I have issued a courtesy note at the Junction centre. '''You seem to be an adult, mature sysop here''' - and might want to save this site from legal troubles by deleting that page. [[User:Gregory Kohs|Gregory Kohs]] 09:18, 8 April 2009 (UTC)}}


The jury is still out on which is funnier: the fact that the [[troll]] thought that this would actually work, or the attempt to appeal to [[pedo|Zaiger's]] [[dollfag|mature]] [[basement dweller|side]].

===Surprise E-sex change===

In May 2009 Gregory Kohs underwent a surprise e-sex change surgery that transformed <s>him</s> her into a [[:Image:Snkohs.jpg|really fuckable model]] ([http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile?show=6303924aca31975d4efe5df45761b87caa direct link], [http://72.14.235.132/search?q=cache:Tl5djfhGNosJ:answers.yahoo.com/my/profile%3Fshow%3D6303924aca31975d4efe5df45761b87caa+thekohser&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk Google cache]). This is indeed the real Kohs; we guess he gave up when he realized he had no testes.

== Gregory Kohs Admin sock account ==
Around January 2010, using the money he earned from MyWikiBiz, Thehoser bought the admin sock account {{wpul|Cool3}} from WR. Shame he didn't get a chance to vandalize with it. This account was discovered and desysopped when him and some sock accounts he used to vandalize were Checkusered.
