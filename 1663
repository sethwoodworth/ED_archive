Coding
[[Image:Coding.jpg|thumb|An example of how coding can break your computer with falsities.]]
Coding was a term made up some time in the past to replace its [[fat|bulkier]] and more annoying predecessor 'breaking the computer'.  Used by such villains as [[Microsoft]], [[Linus Torvalds]], and [[Hitler]], coding works specifically to overclock, overheat, and [[sodomize]] your BIOS by cluttering it with useless 'programs' and '[[operating system]]s'.  Since it is [[common knowledge]] that only complete wusses use such things (real men prefering to work directly in [[binary]]), very few [[important]] people are affected.

Before coding was invented, strange bits of paper containing [[magic]] spells were used.  These wizardly artifacts were inserted directly into the computer to give it instructions via [[psychic|telepathy]].  'Punch cards', as they were known, were far more reliable than coding - due to their complicated nature prohibiting [[idiots]], and restriction to [[straight]] [[white]] '''[[men]]'''.  However, today, since any [[moron]] can pick up a compiler and mash keys until they create their own personal [[Linux|abomination]], it is no great feat to foresee an end of the [[internet|world]] brought about by a flood of [[windows|shitty applications]].

Coding is also called [[magic]], [[Hackers|haxing]], [[Rape]], [[Animal_Abuse|Animal Abuse]], [[Clusterfuck|Clusterfucking]] and [[Magnets]]. In some parts of the world, coding is also referred to as [[DOS]]. Typically, people named [[Bill_Gates|Bill Gates]] enjoy coding in public to scare non believers and [[Christians]], as coding is a form of [[The_Greatest_Story_Ever_Told|worshipping Satan]]. Although [[Science|scientists]] have not actually proved coding is bad for you, many people have suffered severe [[AIDS|arthritis]] and [[Blind|lack of eyes]] from prolonged exposure to [[Computer|CRT radiation]].
== Comprehensive Guide For Coding ==
# Decide what you want to do (and be sure that you will do better than the thing which is already one before)
# Pick a programming language for your goal (don't waste too much time on it.)
# Download a *.chm documentation of the programming language. 
# Download the most stable version of the IDE you want to use.
# Start typing
# Use your mouse as less as you can
# Create classes, their constructors and functions which fill the local variables first.
# use comments in your code a lot
# make a to do list
# exploit open source websites as much as you can ('''Everyone''' does it and it's not cheating!)
# be patient, you are gonna deal with many errors.
