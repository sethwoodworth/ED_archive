Three '''East High School''' football players were arrested and charged in juvenile court after police say they forcibly held down other players and [[buttsecks|committed various sex acts]] on them. The players eventually were kicked off the team due to [[fag|MALE ON MALE]] [[Rape|rape]]! The three defendants, '''all 15 years old''', each face multiple charges, including forcible sodomy, attempted forcible sodomy and forcible sexual abuse, all first-degree felonies. Meanwhile, [[anonymous]] is using the power of [[social engineering]] to find their [[MySpace]] accounts and other [[Web 2.0]] trash for future [[LOL]] profit as predicted [http://deseretnews.com/user/comments/1,5150,695213585,00.html]. 

==History==
[[Image:Gameplan.jpg|thumb|Secret strategy revealed!]]
In one incident, a student said that after East's big game, he was jumped by two students in the locker room, according to court documents was "pwned". The two juveniles held the victim down while a third attempted [[rape|forcible sodomy]]. The boy was able to escape by <strike>fighting</strike> [[masturbation|beating off]] his attackers. A second student said that sometime between Sept. 3 and 6 he was in the showers at East High School when two students pulled him to the ground and forced him into a corner of the shower. In a third incident, a student said that after sophomore football practice on [[Jews did wtc|Sept. 11]] (zomg!, conspiracy!!!), he was in the locker room changing when another player told him he had something on his back, according to court documents. When the victim turned around the other boy grabbed him and held him down on a bench and attempted sexual assault, court documents state. After that incident, another sophomore who witnessed the incident reported it to one of the sophomore team coaches, who then called Leopards head coach.

{{quote|The next morning I reported it to my administration, and then we called the Salt Lake police (UTAH, lol, fucking mormonz)....We immediately suspended the three players from the team. ... We've never had anything like this happen, unless I pulled their pants down|Coach Whitehead :Leopards Football}}

{{quote|After watching CNN's coverage of the "[[Jena Six]]" story, I have been enlightened. Stomping someone after he's lost consciousness or raping another male is no crime. Now, if those boys had hung a noose in a tree, they should be put to death! When is America going to wake up. After all, if you had to choose, wouldn't you rather be raped or stomped by 6 guys rather than endure the sight of a piece of rope left by a 16 year old?...|anonoymous}}

Within a day of East administrators reporting the incident, police referred the case to Salt Lake County prosecutors. The student-athletes eventually were dismissed from the team and have not been attending school at East High, although district officials declined to say whether the boys have received specific discipline, including expulsion, suspension, and/or possible revenge [[rape]].
