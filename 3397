Golden iPod
[[Image:Lulzycolumbine1.jpg|thumb|Comes with a free crucifix.]]

'''The Golden iPod Award''' is given to one person who managed to become [[an hero]] (i.e. commit [[suicide]]) in a [[lulzy]] way and bring joy to the [[interwebs]]. There can only be one Golden [[iPod]] each year, and the competition is very tough. The first person ever to receive an Golden iPod was [[Mitchell Henderson]], for his drama-inducing self-pwnage and subsequent posthumous pioneering of the phrase "[[an hero]]".

= Requirements for the Golden iPod Award =
* The person must have become [[an Hero]].
* There must be [[drama]] involved.
* The person must have an [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] article.
* The person must have become an hero in a [[lulzy]] way.

= An Hero, 2006 =

* [[Mitchell Henderson]]
''For becoming the first person to receive the An Hero title and for bringing many lulz to the internets. Mitchell showed us that death does not have to be sad, but could in fact be quite hilarious. For losing his iPod and creating a new classic [[meme]] in the process, Mitchell Henderson lives on in our hearts and in our hard drives, and receives the Golden iPod Award of 2006.''

*[[Cho Seung-Hui]]
''For performing the amazing feat of 32 * over 9000 kills (<strike>33</strike> 31 if you count his self-pwning; suicide penalty, lulz), <strike>a high score which has yet to be broken</strike>  <strike>learn to history ([[Port Arthur massacre]])</strike>(BRB Jail, Not An Hero - Epic win: [[Uiryeong massacre]]).

=== Disqualified nominees ===
*[[Heath Ledger]] -- ''He overdosed by accident, he never meant to become an hero. His OD wasn't even worth a darwin award, unlike [[Codey Porter]].''
*[[Brandon Crisp]] -- ''He had a luzly brawl with his parents, like [[Jake Roberts|Jake "An Wii-ro" Roberts]], but he did not run out in the woods to kill himself. He fell from a tree by accident, which is a unfunny death. [[Brandon Crisp]] was disqualified even though he is popular and did bring many lulz to the internets and a [[b|specific image board]]. If Brandon jumped from a cliff or hanged himself from that tree, he could have won '''the game'''.''
*[[Sam Leeson]] -- ''Even though he spawned some lulz on 4chan and Bebo, he was nominated too late. '''PROTIP:''' nominate people '''before''' the voting starts''.

*[[Bruce Jeffrey Pardo|Bruce "Satan Claus" Pardo]]

''Bruce Jeffrey Pardo has [[winnar|won]] 2008's Golden iPod Award for the incredibly lulzy task of [[cosplay|dressing up]] like Santa Claus on Christmas eve, knocking on his in-laws' door while they were having a Christmas party, and shooting an '''8 year old girl in the face''' when she answered. He subsequently went on to [[pwn]] 9 people in all, including himself, but not before burning the house down with a flamethrower. The only explanation possible for this act is that he was extremely horny? Bruce Jeffrey Pardo was an amazing individual, but not least of all, he was [[An Hero]].''

By default, it goes to [[OldDirtyBtard]]. Rest in peace bro.

''On Saturday, October 30, OldDirtyBtard was martyred by the Pharisitic bastards at the Church of [[Scientology]]. The cause of death was labeled suicide, and the [[police]] refuse to investigate the issue further. He will be sorely missed. As ODB was a career alcoholic, over-aged EDiots (a word invented by the Captain himself) are advised to take a shot in remembrance.''
