Hepday
Hepday, celebrated every Jewly 31st, celebrates two events. The first and foremost being the liberation of Hepatista prisoners being held by black person forces during the great Turban Conflict of 1983. Second, and much less notably, it is [[hepkitten]]'s birthday.

In [[2005]], [[jesuitx]] and [[weev]] of [[Bantown]] made a song to commemorate Hep's 27th birthday. In [[2006]] the tradition continued with another track honoring Hep's 28th birthday.
