A collection of slowly decaying slices of tree, glued together with dead horses and covered in [[Admiral_Ackbar|squid]] [[cum|juice]]. 
Definitely [[old_media|old media]].  Nothing of interest has ever been written in a book - and if it has, it's also available on the [[internets]].  It's [[rumors|rumored]] that some people keep their [[LiveJournal]]s in books [[at_least_100_years_ago|before the internets]], but this seems unlikely - who would keep a journal that no-one else could read, [[amirite|amirite?]].  Books are also responsible for the creation of [[religion]], [[role-playing]] and most of the [[slashfic]] in existence - which is why they should be destroyed at every opportunity. 

Since the creation of the [[internets]] [[last Thursday]] [[nobody gives a shit]] about books anymore. Some nostalgic [[nerd]]s have tried bringing them back by writing books about the [[internets]] such as [[Otherland]] but lazy [[Americunt]]s don't want to waste their energy turning pages.

[[some argue | Scientists speculate]] that many years ago, books contained some importance to people, possibly having some informational value.  It is unknown whether or not this will be proven true or false.

Books are often found in the backpacks of [[16-year-old girl|loli]], as they have no nutritional value and do not act as a lubricant, it is suggested that you use the books raise the [[16-year-old girl | loli]] up to waist height. Most [[Pedophilia | Pedophiles]] post the titles of the books they have found on [[Lithursday]].

== Books as a source of lulz ==
* [[Hitler]] and his [[Republican|fanclub]] like burning books, which creates much [[drama]] amongst [[liberalism|whiners]].
* [[The_Great_Dumbledore_Dies_Meme_of_2005|Revealing spoilers]] to a book's [[fandom|rabid fans]] is good for a [[lul]] or two.
* [[Paladin-Press]] books are practically lulz manuals.
* The [[Bible]] and the [[Islam|Koran]] are both books. If that's not a huge recipe for drama, I don't know what is.  
* HOMFG TWILIGHT IS ACTUALLY A BOOK! Lulz.
