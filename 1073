Bob Ross <s>is</s> was a New Age [[hippie]] [[tree hugger]] who <s>is</s> was best known for speaking softly, sporting an [[nigra|afro]] wig made out of his own pubic hair, and painting.  [[At least 100 years ago]], Bob hosted a PBS program, "The Joy of Painting," where he would showcase his knack for painting happy little LSD clouds, happy little mushroom mountains, happy little cannabis trees, and [[guro]] porn.

In 1995, Ross received his [[Goatse|widest exposure]] when he created what many of his critics claimed to be [[THE BEST|the greatest painting of all time]].  This painting would not only be the greatest of his career, but the greatest in the history of the universe. It was, in fact, so realistic in nature that it was more real than reality itself. This painting was said to have [[Portals|bridged the void between the dimensions]] and, consequently, Bob Ross painted himself into another dimension where he resided until 2001. Despite this, however, Ross has made contact multiple times to this plane of existence. The most popular of which occurred on March 24, 1999 in which Ross described his new home, saying, "Happy trees ain't got shit on this!"

On September 10th, 2001 he made a painting of some happy little planes flying into some big ol' buildings. When the World Trade Center was attacked on [[WTC|September 11th]] everyone realized that everything Bob painted in his dimension became real. [[Satan]] sent out his minions of doom to kidnap Bob so he could paint the arrival of the [[Barack Jesus|antichrist]]. To save the world, Bob [[an hero|killed himself]].
