Video games
Many companies have produced consoles in the hopes of gathering many gold coins from [[sheep|dedicated gamers]]. Most video games come from [[Japan]], as they seem to have superior graphic design [[skillz]], which is the only reason [[Americunts]] didn't [[perma-ban]] them IRL in [[World War 2|WWII]].

Japanese consoles: [[Playstation]]s 1, 2, and 3 had [[moar]] fail added with each new system. [[Nintendo]], [[SNES]], [[Gamecube|GaemJEWb]] and [[Wii]] have been known to exploit [[furry|furfag]] tendencies and games with Devdan in their [[fandom]].

The [[Zionist|American company]] [[Microsoft]] retaliated with a [[trolling|sneak attack]] by releasing the [[XBox|HUEG ASS XBORX]].  The XBox was enormous and didn't fit in most black person homes, but its [[rainbow blinkies|magnificent graphics]] created many [[Fanboys|submissive zombies]]. It also had a tendency to burst into flames, producing much [[lulz]]. The [[XBox 360]] was later introduced to prevent a widening of the video game [[cameltoe|gap]]. Consoles wars are heavily focused between PEE-ESS-TREE and EXBAWKS because they are both so insanely expensive, gamers parents don't allot them enough allowance to buy both. Thus flame wars ensue over which console is superior, in attempts to justify their purchase to everyone else.

==History==

===[[At least 100 years ago|In the Beginning]]===
The first [[abandonware|video game]] was written and designed by [[Bill Gates]], which was [[Halo]]. Before this were countless better games on the PC, but the sheltered hobofag lifestyles of console kidz lef them shock n awed with what was essentially a rehash of mediocrity. While Halo might be considered the first great game, it was just that, a ''game''. On the PC, that fuckin shit is a lifestyle.

===[[Last Thursday|Shortly after the beginning, but Pre-Halo]]===
This epoch was dominated by games like ''[[Battletoads]]'', ''[[Bad Dudes]]'', ''[[Mario|Super Mario Brothers]]'' and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', where the [[luser|user]] would save the world in form of a [[stereotypes|stereotype]] or [[furry]].  These games were ok but the graphics, for their time, sucked, and not until the advent of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' would the teeming millions of graphic whores be satisfied. ''Jew'', however, was a great game.  Unused bomb-shelters from the Cold War were beginning to be transformed into [[basement-dweller|game rooms]], where gamers could [[fap|play in solitude]]. Eventually, [[MMORPG]]s and ''[[Halo]]'' came around and the basement-dwellers, who previously only came up for air every three months, now had the option to sell inflated game accounts on [[eBay]], which made it possible to remain underground [[evar|forever]]. They would later evolve into the [[vampires|Morlocks]]. Contrary to what some might tell you, ''Halo ''actually invented the FPS genre (Yeah, no). And the RPG genre. Actually, ''Halo'' invented games. And life on Earth. And inventing things.

Pac Man fever became the first widely spread [[eTD|electronically transmitted disease]].

===[[9/11|Halo]]===
''[[Halo]]'' was a [[Lie|cool]] game because it was the first first person shooter, or FFPS, [[EVAR]]! It's story was very inventive, you're a [[original character|genetically-altered soldier in the year 2552]] who has to fight aliens on some planet you crash land on with some cybernetic bitch constantly screaming in your ear. You fight many aliens, swamp monsters, robots, volcanoes, and of course [[tubgirl]]. Anyone who doesn't like this game is obviously an [[emo]] [[faggot]] or a [[communist]]. [[Halo]] even has its own website, [[Bungie.net]]

===[[2004|Halo 2]]===
Sequel to ''[[Halo]]''. Now [[Fags]] can cause [[butthurt]] while wielding two guns at once and are also able to link to other losers 'round the world. [[Gamers]] eagerly await ''Halo 3'' so they can finally use their penis in combat, while they scream about how fucked up they are over their headset. ''Halo 2'''s new features include texture pop-in (most prevalent in cutscenes), terrible network coding, a convoluted plot, no story progression, and much more tentacles.

===[[2007|Halo 3]]===
Sequel to ''Halo 2'' where Master Chief returns after an annoying cliff hanger to join forces with the arbiter so they can get to [[buttsecks|saving the universe]] While many Fanboys thought ''Halo 2'' was ruined compared to ''Halo'', anyone who has even played ''Halo 2'' will immediately realize that Halo 3's multiplayer has been severely beaten by adding the Mauler which makes the [[13 year old boys|user]] of this weapon instantaneously gay.

==Future==
Games are now mainstreamed for streamlined accessibility.

==Types of Video Games==

===Fighting Games===
A very hard and rather intelligent gaming genre which requires the player to ball their hand into a fist and smash as many buttons as possible until somebody dies. An example of most fighting games can be found [http://youtube.com/watch?v=mG3SANQZNwM here.]

===First-Person Shooters===
[[Image:BIA GRAPHICS LOL.jpg|right|thumb|A Typical [[World War 2 | WW2]] Game Scenario]]
[[File:OrbitalDeerHunter.jpg|thumb|Exceedingly unfair!]]
In First-Person Shooters or more commonly FPS, the player's objective is to move the [[cock|joystick]] around until they find an enemy and then attempt to aim at them and pull the controller's trigger. This is often deemed impossible by FPS [[basement dwellers|gamers]], the common alternative is to just throw frags and hope you don't [[an hero|kill yourself]].

===Music-related Games===
This is when you pretend you have had any musical experience in your life and try to look experienced whether it be dancing like an [[azn]], hitting buttons on a fake guitar, or making an annoying, crackling puberty shriek into a microphone and referring to it as singing.

===Third-Person Shooter===
Almost exactly the same as FPSs, but now the camera fucks up on you and instead of having the aim that comes with the FPS view, you now blindly shoot around from the position of a puppet master stalker behind your character.

===[[LARP|Role Playing Games]]===
Does anyone remember the original RPGs where you sat in a basement covered in acne, wearing a wizard hat, and pretending you had a life? Well, these are pretty much the same except now you can leave the basement while still remaining in its [[hugbox|safety]], and further enhances the no life experience by removing the need to be in the same room as your fellow socially retarded friends. The player can now design their character to be free of acne and actually able to talk to people. Hell, if they have enough game money they may even be able to get their [[secks|Holy Grail]], not IRL of course.

===Real Time Strategy===
[[Image:Stronghold Crusader Extreme2.jpg|thumb|Fun Fun.]]
You play as person who actually gets respect(big surprise for [[you]], I know) and has the ability to command vast armies for whatever retarded purpose they could desire. Seriously, these are [[lies|cool]] but usually they revolve around making [[Army|tanks]], sending them some where, and then harvesting [[goatse|crystals of some sort]] for money so you can make more tanks. These games are played by [[pussies|pushovers]] who want to feel intelligent.

===Massively Multiplayer Online Games===
These are ironically the games that are inhabited by the most socially inept fucking [[lusers]] to ever roam the [[interbutts]]. Usually they're obsessed with leveling which makes their [[E-Penis]] bigger, getting virtual Jew Golds, and meeting more people they can poorly interact with. Often at times, people on MMOs will form [[the Power 5|guilds]] (vast [[circlejerk|circlejerks]] of lusers) so they can pretend they have really close friends. MMO players almost never leave their compy (or a console, lulz) unless it's to go clean their grandmother's toilets or mow lawns so they can get their monthly subscription paid. [[Gay|Popular]] MMOs are ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[Runescape]]'', ''[[EverQuest]]'', ''[[EverQuest II]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', ''[[EVE Online]]'', and ''[[Darkfall]]''. Some games are [[Shit nobody cares about|mistaken]] for MMORPGs, when in reality, they're not massive (whatever that means!) Some of these games are ''[[Diablo II]]'', ''Phantasy Star Online'', ''Phantasy Star Universe'', and ''[[Guild Wars]]''. Even fewer games of the this genre get shut down because of how [[Bad|terrible]] they are, like ''[[Tabula Rasa]]''.

===[[Football|Sports Games]]===
[[Image:Finalfantasysexgame.jpg|thumb|Final Fellatio XXX]]

Most games are used to remove people from their crap reality, these are just for [[you|people who suck at sports]].

===[[Online sex games|Sex Games]]===

Although there have been a few of these games for consoles, most of these games exist only on the Internet. Taking anywhere from 2 minutes to 12 hours to complete, the grand reward being poorly drawn [[DeviantArt|fanporn]] or horribly animated [[Homestarrunner|flashsex]]. These games are usually comical in their inaccurate descriptions
of [[fucking]]. [[Furries]] and [[pedophiles]] rejoice in the variety available to them.


===Survival Horror===
These are games that try to scare you in a medium where you control the action, and are thus more invested than you would be in the more passive entertainment of a movie or book.  Of course, this is also a medium where death is only a minor inconvenience and save points and continues allow you to pick up where you left your mortal coil.  To get around this, games in this category try to be scary by having [[Resident Evil|terrible controls]], limited resources, [[Silent Hill|mind-fuck fourth wall breaking]], or [[Dino Crisis 2|plots and scenarios so mind-numbingly stupid that it's horrifying to think anyone was paid to write them]].  

Capcom generally gets the credit for creating this genre, but nearly every other developer has [[Konami|improved on it]].

...awell the tiem and eevrydai. ya herdd? unh.

===Rules of t3h Vidyo Gaemes===
those tempted enough to enter the world of the video games [the matrix] should be careful and follow these rules

1. Link comes before Mario, ALWAYS

2. [[lie|The only reason why xbox isn't the perfect system is because we have to pay for online.]]

3. Never know too much about anything in the video game world.

  a. exception is knowing through ____pedia, you'll still sound like a nerd in real life, but the choice is up to you

4.If you're planning to [[Impossible|have a life,]] multiplayer games should be played with people you can see in real life on a daily basis, and single player games are the last resort for boredom, (as in, they do not come before your Wapanese girlfriend, the emos you hang out with, or WORK.)

5.The rules of the internet still apply in halo.

6."Check your corners"

7.The Nintendo Wii has no good third party games, the guitar hero games are murphed.

8.If you beat a physically fit Asian at DDR, you might as well be a prophet.

9.With great rankings comes great responsibility,  you can call them annoying, but saying "you suck" can make you look like a douche bag, how is that bad? try playing with people better than you, yeah being a hypocrite is fun isn't it?

10."CHECK THOSE CORNERS"

11.PCs are the best system ever.

12. Those hot chicks who appear on the game guides and commercials? [[RAGE|GUESS WHAT ASSHOLE!!!!!]] THEY'RE MODELS! THEY'RE MODELS! THEY ARE MODELS! These chicks have tits the size of watermelons and brains the size of your dick (all .00000000001 in. of it) who get paid ten grand to rub a copy of [[Halo|Halo 8]] between their tits or read lines off a teleprompter!! That's the only time they ever do anything video-game related, the rest of their time is spent on doing materialistic shit or <s>sleeping with me</s> getting drunk! Sorry to burst your bubble, guess you can [[Budd Dwyer|go pull a Budd Dwyer now.]]
