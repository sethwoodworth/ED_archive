BDSM
[[File:Bloody Midget Strangle.jpg|thumb|right|Smile - this costs $40 in Thailand.]] 
'''BDSM''' is an acronym that stands for a variety of things depending on your viewpoint or by how much stubborn purist [[bullshit]] you can stand. If we're going to be [[anal]] here, it's supposed to stand for either ''"bondage,  [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Ei2domination.GIF domination], sadism  & masochism,"'' OR ''"bondage, domination, slavery, mastery."'', or any of a thousand other [[aspie]] variations. But srsly, it's just like real sex, only with [[MOAR]] mouth foaming and [[beautiful|FATTER]] [[girls|CHICKS]] (aka "BBW"s  (yet ''moar'' acronyms!) commonly translated as ''"Bloated Beached Whale"'' or some variant thereof).

Truth be told, it could stand for [[bullshit]], [[dongs]], [[shit]] & your [[mom|MOM]] but some silly [[faggot|j00]] would get all bent out of shape over it, and claim that they're the authority on the subject. 

==Where Does This Shit Happen?!==

[[Image:Michelle grope.JPG|thumb|SAVE THE PRINCESS! [[MAN THE HARPOONS]]!]]

BDSM communities exist [[OL]], [[IRL]], and in [[Pulling a Lynndie|Abu-Ghraib]] [[prison]]. 

These places are a veritable hive for [[drama]], typically beginning with individuals looking for "hot [[bisexual|bi]] babes" or an "[[Internet]] [[sadist|Mistress]]."  Most of the people searching for the ever elusive 'attractive' pervert are [[fat]], [[ugly]] married men with [[aspie|aspergers]] and [[penis]] smaller than [[Paris Hilton]]'s IQ. 

In online communities, drama frequently revolves around who knows more about BDSM, has the most slaves, or is most deserving of respect.  Then there's the [[bullshit]] about safety and sanity, with [[stupid]] [[fat]] [[bitch|bitches]] who scream [[abuse]] when normal men tell them that in fact the ''dress'' they were wearing ''doesn't'' make them look [[fat]] --their [[fat|FAT FUCKING ASS]] makes them look [[fat]].  

There is of course the male equivalent of the [[fat|female fatty]], and he's usually too busy whining about the fact that no-one cares about his intelligence, whilst munching down on his tenth packet of pop tarts of the day jerking off to BDSM furporn.  

Women into BDSM communities are exclusively [[fat]]/[[insane]]/[[ugly]] (pick any two), whereas the men in BDSM Communities are [[cuckoldry|cuckolds]], time-served sex offenders or [[aspies]].  Check that, EVERYONE in the BDSM communities on [[LJ]] has [http://www.livejournal.com/community/male_dom/749586.html Aspergers] AND [[BAW|NO-ONE UNDERSTANDS THEM, DAMMIT]]. Most dominant men can be identified by the vile stench of sweat and their tendency to have pot bellies hanging over their ill-fitting chaps. Some identify themselves further by use of a belt, on which they hang floggers and whips they've never used on another human evar and probably purchased [[last Thursday]].

Few people who talk about BDSM online have any experience of it and most are in fact [[virgins]], thank God.  There is however something much, much worse than the online BDSM community, and that is the [[Gorean]] community. Goreans like to think they are into BDSM but they are, in fact, the perverted equivalent of a [[Star Trek]] fan, living their sad lives by a series of books written by a massive failure who have no concept of outside social and economic obligations because subs have no lives of their own. BDSM'ers laugh at Goreans, unaware of the huge irony in this.  At least they're getting laid over and over again (in theory) and not giving every single cent and moment of their next billion years to a [[cult]]. 

A few of these retards achieve their life's goal of leaving their computer desk and interacting with '[[fat|real]] women' at IRL BDSM conventions.  What goes on?  You're bound to find furniture like a giant spider web, St. Catherine's wheel or St. Andrew's cross.  You'll be amused by nearly naked old men, nubile females and traps tied up to these apparati as variations of the same weld various instruments against their flesh until the sub drops dox (a common safeword) or screams "red" long after they've turned red.  Mind you, penetration and genital play (nipples tend to get covered by electrical tape) is b& in these above ground underground clubs thanks to liquor control laws.  Vendors tend to engage in a circle jerk of BAWWING about how no one wants to buy their floggers when everyone vending has pretty much the same exorbitantly priced toys made in their basements by their own kajira.  

Entertainment at the larger BDSM parties and conventions can reliably be guaranteed to consist of much unrealistic strutting suggestively on stage by people who wish they were fetish models and porn starlets acting out fantasies of [[b|14-year old boys]] and 40 year old sick fucks.  Throw in a fire breather and a few fashion shows and you have it made.

The more pathetic individuals (ie. all of them) identifying with BDSM communities refer to their affiliation euphemistically as ''the lifestyle'' when discussing it with others who have similar interests. This allows them to feel like they belong to a special secret club (for perverts), when in reality it's another bunch of sad basement dwellers into weird porn and [[lie|lying]] about getting laid IRL.

Communication on B.com takes many forms (usually insanely repetitive and inane, much like [[4chan]]'s /b/ but with moar faggotry). Most posts are vacuous, whether it be Brit bashing (the site is American), Nigra bashing or dumb Yanks asking silly questions about whether "having sex without a condom could leave to any negative effects". This site was owned by a [[pedo]] called Andy, but is now owned by shit jazz-mag purveyor Penthouse. Accordingly, the forums now read like Readers Wives letters with generous helpings of pseudo-pedo porn featuring hot dogs and whip marks drawn on with lipstick. This site has plenty of flame opportunities and a membership of emotionally unbalanced fucktards. The Technique and Relationship forums are especially lulzworthy if you fancy having 90 fat howling bitches screaming at you for daring to question their equally fatfuck leather-vested "mathter's" authoritah. Troll immediately.

* [http://www.informedconsent.co.uk Informed Consent - Fail Site full of fat fail Britfags, also a known haven for obese women who vote BNP / Nazi]
Britain’s Informed Consent, on the other hand is completely different (yet equally retarded); posts are strictly moderated by the site owner, a total knob known simply as [[User:TheSecretary/Tanos|Tanos]]. An [[emo]] Jew, Tanos is a nerd with forum software and a zionistic zeal. Apart from this, little is know about him except that he is a former Mossad hacker and was responsible for helping to plan 9/11. Since [[last Thursday]], [[User:TheSecretary/Tanos|Tanos]] has been busy [[Butthurt|banning trolls and wannabe trolls in order to keep his forums pure and full of BDSM, even if it is at the cost of lulz]]. In the recent pogrom, even fat ugly women get banned.  Therefore, there are no women on informed consent. Tanos currently lives with two women who are brainwashed into thinking his abuse of them is completely normal and hides from various people in the scene who want to knock his lights out for being up his arse. His website is full of sick fucks, the majority being [[e-lawyers]], wankers, fat bints, tards or a combination of all of these. A popular hobby on Informed Consent is 'outing' - revealing the [[powerword|real names and identities]] of posters to newspapers. This is helped immeasurably by IC having its own [http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=4827281965 Facebook group]. [[User:TheSecretary/Tanos|Tanos]] has also cut back the 'off topic' section of Informed Consent - because BDSM is [[serious business]].  Troll immediately. Some twats have set up a great pisstake of IC; http://www.deformedconsent.co.uk

Recently [[lolcows]] over at IC got much [[butthurt]] when they read [http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/boards/help/194317/ this]. All of them failed to understand the lulz and their leader Tanos claimed ED is a neo nazi site for pedos and furfags. There have also been many other threads with all sorts of fail, including taking out internet lawsuits and threats of violence against [[Anonymous]]. RAID RAID RAID RAID

Best porn I've found for M/M, F/F and M/F relationships. Good jack material if you watch the previews.

* [http://mistressdestiny.com/forums/ Mistress Destiny]
The saddest gathering of foot fetishists you will ever come across online. Threads mainly go one of two ways - "Why aren't there more women posting here" and "Fuck off women, you are all cunts because you won't come near our ugly fucking asses without being paid". Thus, the site eminently trollable and full of fail and AIDS.

* [http://collarme.com Collarme.com] 
Enormous pot of [[fuckwit|fuckwits]] and pedophiles. Raid the forums for much lulz, as the community takes itself entirely too seriously. Goreans are especially entertaining for their efforts to try and convince every whore on the site to dance naked for them on cam.

Not really worthy of raids or even casual trolling, as they are all stuck in the hell they created for themselves.

He's an IMVU "master", Who currently turned his messages to friends only, Best way to talk to him is through PrivateChats.  He claims he can "hypnotize" you with his voice, if you decline he gets butthurt and tries to spread rumors about you cos mommy didn't love him like she loves you. Best ways to get him to go "OMG I'M BETTAR THEN U" is by telling him he's a pathic bitch boy who is still sucking on his mommies titties and snatch, Also remind him You're a better person then him because you don't fuck 13 year old girls.
