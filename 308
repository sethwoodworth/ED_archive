''Ajax could mean:''

*[[Ajax (JavaScript)|Scripting]]: Ajax is one of the things which any website needs to be [[web 2.0]]. Ajax was created by the same [[Harry Potter|wizards]] that made Stonehenge and is the source of most evil on teh [[internets]], such as [[Digg]] and del.icio.us, and lots of other websites not worth visiting. They says that it's an entirely new way of programming sites, but we all know it's just a reinvention of JavaScript, which existed [[at least 100]] years ago. They say using Ajax reduces server loads and allows your web servers to more easily run an [[Internet Hate Machine]]. 

*[[Football|Soccer Team]]: Ajax is a Dutch soccer team full of [[Jews]], a fact they try to hide [[Fail|unsuccessfully]], since [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax#References_to_Judaismeven even Wikipedia knows it.] Luckily, [[Shit no one cares about|no one cares]] about soccer.

*[[U413 Ajax|Site Admin]]: Ajax, The asshole Admin of U413 who forced 3 times of inaccessibility

*[[Douche|Cleaning product]]: Ajax is also the name of a great tasting dish-cleaner that smells like severely wet ass with a hint of lemon.

*Town: A small [[shit|shithole]] east of [[Canadia|Toronto]] that is infested with [[niggers]]

*[[Linux|Porta-Potty]]: Ajax is also the name of a porta-potty company run by [[mexicans]] that haven't ever been cleaned and never will, not even by the Mexicans that own them.

*Warrior: Ajax is also one of the main characters from the movie The Warriors, notable for not being a black person and for his love of [[rape]].
