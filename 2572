EarthBound

[[File:PSISwastika.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sieg heil!]]
The '''Earthbound''' series is an [[Pain series|series]] of [[Fail|epic]] RPGs for the [[Old meme|SNES]] and Game Boy Advance that were created by [[Nintendo]] [[last Thursday|in the year 1994]]. Earthbound is the most overrated game among [[Retro|retrofags]], [[Super Smash Bros]] fanboys, and [[autistic]] adults. This game is known as [[Lie|TEH BEST FUKKEN SNES GAME OF ALL TIEM!!11!!]] to [[Retro|Nostalgiafags]] and EB fantards. Earthbound mostly involves a little [[13 year old boys|13 year old]] and his friends bashing and destroying weird enemies like [[lolwut|walking mushrooms, talking traffic signs, suicide bombing trees, hippies, Mad Taxis, Putrid Modlymen, barf piles]], [[niggers]], [[Jews]], and other random enemies by using baseball bats, frying pans, bottle rockets, and [[mindfuck|PSI attacks]]. Earthbound was the only game in the ''Mother'' series released in the [[Jewnited States of Americunts]] since [[Japanese]] people enjoy [[IRL trolling]] [[Americunts]] for teh lulz by refusing to release the other games in the series. As a results, some [[No life|die-hard EarthBound fanboys]] decided to make an [[Engrish|unofficial translation]] of Mother 3. Only one lucky basement dweller holds the sole original copy of the English version of the first game. He then proceeded to put the ROM onto the Internet, so everyone else could [[torrent]] it. 

And the guy who made it, Shigesato Itoi, [[Fact|has Assburgers]]. No [[srsly]]. It explains a lot.

==The games==

===Earthbound ([[Your mom|Mother]] 2)===
[[File:KKK insane cultist.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Looks familiar?]]
[[File:Devil's Machine Goatse.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Goatse|The secret of the Devil's Machine]]. ]]
The story began one night in a city called Onett (located in [[America|Eagleland]]) in the year [[1990|199X]]. Ness, the protagonist, woke up as [[kill it with fire|a meteorite landed on a hill nearby his house]]. So, like any other curious kid, he decided to check it out with his dog, King, and next door neighbor, [[Fatass|Pokey]]. A fly/[[wetback|alien]]/whatever named Buzz Buzz appeared at the site and told Ness that he must [[unoriginal|stop Giygas from destroying the world]] [[Cocaine|because the Apple of Enlightenment predicted that it will happen]]. About five minutes later Pokey's mom swats Buzz Buzz because she, like most sane people, doesn't like having a fly in her house. Buzz Buzz then gave Ness a [[iPod|Sound Stone]], so he could collect the sounds of various melodies needed to kill Giygas. So after Ness helps [[Fatass|Pokey/Porky]], he goes to save the world packing up, and going to beat people's asses to meet 2 guys and a girl that the Apple of Enlightenment told him to find and beat [[Mewtwo|Giygas]]. Later on, after being molested and raped many times, a girl named [[Loli|Paula]] uses her [[psychic|telekinetic]] powers to tell Ness to save her and to rescue her from [[David Koresh|Mr. Carpainter]] and from the [[KKK|Insane cultists]] of the [[Cult|Happy Happy Religious Group]]. Then, just after Ness and Paula make a quick getaway, [[Waco|the ATF arrives and exterminates every cultist and their leader in Happy Happy Village]]. After saving Paula, Ness hitchhikes on a bus that belongs to a music group called [[Fat Larry's Band|The Runaway Five]] and moves on to a town that is overrun by zombies. Afterwards, Paula communicates with [[Fag|Jeff]] and Jeff later meets with Ness and Paula after [[Rebel|sneaking out of his boarding school]] and riding a [[Dongcopter|super helicopter]] that his father  invented. Then they head over to a place called Summers and end up tripping balls when a woman feeds them [[LSD|Magic Cake]]. [[Shit|Poo]] undergoes his training and is told by his master that he must teleport to Summers and to join Ness. Many TL;DR scenes later, after finding the 8 melodies, Dr. Andonuts creates a time machine to send Ness, Paula, Jeff, and Poo back in time to defeat Giygas. He builds his machine and [[pagan|transfers their souls]] into [[Robot|robotic bodies]]. In return, Dr. Andonuts molests Paula. In the final battle, they fuck up Pokey (but Pokey runs away like the coward he is) and defeat Giygas by [[Christfag|praying]] to not die since [[LOLWUT|Giygas is vulnerable to human emotions]]. 

tl;dr: Deus ex machina ftw!

====The Truth====

[[File:Giygas abortion.jpg|thumb|center|600px|A rapist is you!]]

===Mother 3 (Earthbound 2:Electric Boogaloo)===
[[File:SSBB group shot.jpg|thumb|right|Like most of their other games, Nintendo whored out EarthBound in the [[Super Smash Bros.]] series.]]
[[At least 100]] years after the events of Earthbound, Porky and his [[Personal army|Pigmask Army]] invade the Nowhere Islands and end up slaying [[over 9000|many]] civilians and spreading swine flu to survivors. [[Win|After the Pigmasks murder Lucas's mom]], [[Brokeback Mountain|Flint]] swears to get revenge on the Pigmasks who killed his wife. Claus tried to kill the draco that killed his mom, but ends up dissapearing. Ness and his father later meet Kumatora, and help her her defeat the Pigmasks who [[gangbang|were taking their turns raping her]]. Later, Alec tells Flint about the [[MTF|Magypsies]], a group of [[gay|flashy]] [[cross-dress]]ers who protect the so-called "Seven Needles". The Seven Needles seal off a [[God|Dark Dragon]], which is capable of [[delete fucking everything|fucking over everything]]. After going through a forest, they eat [[shrooms|hallucinogenic mushrooms]] after getting hungry, since they were too Jew. Afterwards they have an LSD trip and end up in the middle of some jungle. After finding the last of the Seven Needles in New Pork City, they fight Porky, and when Porky loses the battle, his plan end up backfiring when he resorts to getting into the "Absolutely Safe Capsule", [[Shit nobody cares about|which is a machine that keeps the person inside safe. However, The machine can nevar be opened from the outside or from the inside]], which means that [[Win|Porky becomes trapped in a machine for the rest of eternity]]. After causing Pokey to pwn himself, Lucas confronts the Masked man, which turns out to be his brother Claus. Claus accidentally [[an hero|kills himself]] when he tries to zap Lucas, but Lucas's Franklin Badge causes the lightning to reflect and to hit Claus. Lucas then pulls the last needle and [[delete fucking everything|the world blows up]].

==Fandom==

===Earthbound fans===
[[File:IRL Ness.png|thumb|right|Ness IRL]]
Earthbound [[fags|fans]] are either [[Retro|retrofags]], Super Smash Bros fanboys or [[weeaboos]]. The retrofags are the Earthbound fans who spend most of their time [[basement dweller|playing SNES games on their TV in their basement]], playing pirated SNES ROMs on their computer and [[Pedophile|masturbating to rule 34 pictures of Paula or Kumatora]], drawing Earthbound [[Porn|fanart]], and browsing the internet for Earthbound fanart. Smash fags only [[facepalm|play this fucking game just because Ness and Lucas appear in SSBB]]. The rest of the Earthbound fans are [[weeaboos]] who play Earthbound just because it was a game made in Japan and because they believe that Ness and Paula looks so [[kawaii]] ^_^.

Note: Keep in mind that if you encounter an EarthBound/Mother fantard in [[Super Smash Bros|SSBB]], he will only use [[Shota|Ness]] or [[Fag|Lucas]].

===[[deviantart|deviantards]] loves earthbound===
[[deviantART]] is bloated with [[over 9000]] EarthBound fanart pictures, with a majority of them drawn in animu style. Your typical Earthbound fanart pic on deviantart involves [[Shipping|Ness and Paula or Lucas and Kumatora together]], Ness and Co. drawn in desu kawaii animu style, or sketches of Giygas. There's also plenty of [[DO NOT WANT|Ness/Lucas]] [[shota]] if [[sick fuck|you're so inclined]]. There are also decent comics about ness's early childhood where Ness is a fatass, and we are not just saying that because the creator is hot.

===No EB? On my VC?===
A well-known drama in the EarthBound fanbase is the so-called re-release of the game to the [[Wii]]'s Virtual Console. The rumor about it started when a new rating of the game had been posted, which many assumed was for the VC. Of course, to crush their hopes of seeing their precious game on the service, Nintendo stated that the game couldn't be released, and most people guessed it was due to [[stolen|sampled]] music and [[old meme|allusions to what was in 10 years ago]]. This left many EB fans [[butthurt]] since they knew that if the game could sell well on the VC, then Mother 3 would have had it's own release (and not just be a fan-made translation). Of course if you have homebrew you can easily put it on the vc yourself.

===Bound Together===
As is common with [[horrible|popular]] video games, fans always make remixes of the music. EarthBound is no exception to this. A slight difference though is that all of the songs were done as a project called '''Bound Together''', and not all of the songs are even remixes. Yep, there's [[original content|original fan-made songs]] within the compilation. Here are some examples of this [[no|wonderful music project]]:

Interested [[retards|fans]] of the game can check the whole thing out [http://www.wushuplaya.com/boundtogether/ here].

==Shipping faggotry==
Just like any other franchise, EarthBound has fallen victim to shipping wars and shipping faggotry. [[Some argue]] that Ness in in love with Paula, while others believe that [[Lie|they are just friends]]. When people mention this crap in forums, flame wars erupt, and EB fanboys start performing [[ad hominem]] attacks against other EB fantards. [http://ness-x-paula.deviantart.com/ One example of the NessxPaula shipping faggotry can be found here]. EB-shipping fags went batshit when Mother 3 was released in Japan, arguing with other EB fantards that [[Bullshit|Lucas and Kumatora love each other]].

The wedding of Ness & Paula

The bright light of the sun shines in the middle of the church of Onett, as a young boy stands in front of the congregation. He is known as the boy who saved Eagleland from the wrath of Giygas. His name is Ness. He is dressed in a black tuxedo, with a blue cummerbund around his waist. He also has a matching bowtie of the same color, as well as the stripe on his top hat. He was really happy for this day. The day he marries the girl who helped him save his world from Giygas. The one he has been sweet towards: Paula. He looked back to remember the event that has led to this day a couple of months ago.

Flashback

Ness and Paula successfully defeated Giygas, with his two friends' help. Before Jeff Andronuts and Poo depart, Ness said that he needs to confess something to Paula, so they thought they may as well stick around for it.

Ness took Paula's hand and begins to speak. "Paula, we may have been with each other for some time, along with our two friends, and I knew that after I saved you from that monster in the Fourside Department Store, I thought I have to repay you. So, with that said, I'm going to tell you this: Paula, I love you."

Paula gasped as she knew about what she was about to tell him the whole time. "N-Ness, That's what I'm trying to tell you as well!" She then started hugging Ness. "I love you too!"

Jeff and Poo, along the others in Saturn Village, aww'd in joy. Dr. Saturn even smiled to them. "So that's what Jeff's telling me before you went off to fight Giygas. You two are in love. Ding." Dr. Saturn told them.

Ness gave Jeff a cold stare at Jeff. "Look, I knew something's making you two uneasy, so I thought I explain it to Dr. Saturn. He thought you two are in love. But now that you two already confessed your love for one another, he's right."

Ness rolled his eye back at him and back to Paula. "Well, I also have another thing to tell you, but this will change both our lives." He said to her as he pulls out a small, black, velvet box and opened it, containing an engagement ring with a sapphire gem that matches her eyes. He got down on his one knee and pops the question. "Paula, will you marry me?"

Paula's heart starting to beat rapidly as she heard what Ness has just asked. She then hugged him as she accepted. "Yes! Of course Ness! Of course I'll marry you! You made me so happy!" she then kissed him wildly. Ness slid the engagement ring on her ring finger.

Flashback End

Ness was still having that flashback, even in his dreams. He even agreed to Jeff that he helps with his homework, which has been accumulated since during their quest, if he wanted to be his best man. He turns to his sister, who is Paula's maid of honor.

The Bridal Corus began to blare throughout the church, meaning that Ness's bride arrives. The doors opened to reveal Paula, as she walks down the aisle. She looks radiant in her strapless white wedding gown, which fits perfectly for her figure. Her elbow-length-gloved hands clutched her bouquet of roses. She has a white bow on the back of her head, with her beautiful chapel-length veil protruding from it. She took her place near her groom.

"Well, this is it." Ness whispered at his bride.

"We're going to be together forever." Paula whispered back.

The priest took his place and began his spiel. "Dearly beloved, we have gathered here today to witness the marriage of the two who has saved our planet from the wrath of Giygas: Ness and Paula. If anyone has any reason why these two should not be together in holy wedlock, let them speak now or forever hold their peace."

Not one single soul objected. Although someone coughed, it didn't break the happy union in any way.

"Fine, then. Let's begin." The priest then said. "Will you please face each other and join hands?" he then said, as Ness and Paula faced each other and joined their hands. "Ness, will you take this woman, whose hands you hold, choosing her alone to be your wedded wife? Will you live with her in the state of true matrimony? Will you love her, comfort her, through good times and bad, in sickness and in health, honor her at all times, and be faithful to her?"

"I do." Ness responded.

"And Paula, will you take this man, whose hands you hold, choosing him alone to be your wedded husband? Will you live with him in the state of true matrimony? Will you love him, comfort him, through good times and bad, in sickness and in health, honor him at all times, and be faithful to him?" The priest then asked.

"I do." Paula responded.

Then, it's time to present the rings. "Ring bearer, please present them their rings." Poo, who agreed to be the ring bearer, placed the cushion, which has the wedding rings, between both the priest and the couple. "These rings symbolize your union. An unbroken circle of love to be worn all the days so long as you both shall love. May the spirit of love bless these rings and may they be a true symbol of the love of the one who gives it, and the one who wears it." Ness took one of them and recited his speech for the exchange of rings.

"I give you this ring, wear it with love and joy.
I choose you to be my partner,
to have and to hold from this day forward for better or for worse,
for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health,
to love and to cherish as long as we both shall live." Ness then slid the wedding ring on Paula's ring finger, right next to her engagement ring.

"And I give you this ring, wear it with love and joy.
I choose you to be my partner,
to have and to hold from this day forward for better or for worse,
for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health,
to love and to cherish as long as we both shall live." Paula then recited her speech as she slid the ring on Ness's ring finger.

The priest smiled as the wedding is about to end with what the two were waiting for. "In as much as you, Ness and Paula, have consented together in the union of matrimony and you have pledged your faith each to the other in the presence of these witnesses, now by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you Husband and Wife. You may kiss the bride." He then said.

Ness lifted Paula's veil that is covering her face, snuck his hand around her waist, and then pulled her closer. They then closed their eyes, puckered their lips and then gave each other the most passionate kiss they have ever had in their lives.

Everyone gave out a cute 'awwwwwwww' by this very sight.

As the two broke out from their kiss, they walked up the aisle as everyone cheered for the newlywedded couple. They went to the limo and were driven to the site of the reception.
