Aertheca
Greetings traveler! Welcome to the [[serious business]] known as '''''Aertheca''''', a world inhabited predominately by whining [[bitch]]es, short [[Alcoholic|drunkards]] and [[dwarf|rapists]], [[attention whore]]s with pointy ears, more short [[midget]]s, "Halflings" (or, more accurately, human children) and some other races which mostly [[fag|power builders]] and [[wanker]]s use.

== RP Rules ==

# All characters must be the same stereotypical, [[Lord of the Rings|B-grade fantasy creatures]], or else you will never get approval.
# If you make any attempt at forming an original character that breaks the stereotypes, the DMs will be [[Faggot|jealous]] of your AMAZING creativity and you will be [[Forced|asked]] to change everything about your character that makes them interesting.
# Attempting to have any degree of fun is highly frowned upon.
# Never attempt to reason with any DM at any time, they are all-knowing and far more [[intelligent]] than you can possibly imagine.
# Characters are allowed to be any alignment, but if you choose anything that isn't in the [[Christian|Good]] alignment, your character will never receive RP tokens. 
# Talking about anything in-character that does not include [[TL;DR|politics]] about the wars that no one cares about will result in you receiving no tokens.
# If you play a [[female]] character and she is not a [[Mary-Sue]], you will never receive RP tokens.
# Being [[creative]] will not earn you RP tokens.
# Breathing will result in you never receiving RP tokens.
# And remember, [[No|have fun]]!

== Available Classes on Aerthca==

[[Image:PinkGinDress.jpg|thumb|Anyone who plays a character with the slightest RDD or PM in them is clearly [[gay]] -- <big>WHAT THE FUCK DO THESE ABBREVIATIONS MEAN FUCK YOU</big>]]

These are the main classes on ''Aertheca''.

* '''Fighter''' - Played by [[Internet tough guy]]s, this character was designed for [[pussies]] who get beaten up a lot [[IRL]] and want to pretend to be tough.
* '''Wizard''' - This character can use [[magick]] skills such as [[Telekinesis]] and [[Powerword]]. Everyone plays a wizard because they kick ass.
* '''[[Christian|Cleric]]''' - See [[Fred Phelps]].  Played by those who like to be the [[BDSM|heal-bitch]] for everyone else, especially fighters.
* '''Rogue''' - [http://medinsth.ytmnd.com/ Thievish abilities]. Also responsible for killing the party several times on botched disarm trap rolls. Usually played by [[weeaboo]]s who want to be like [[Naruto]] but wind up sucking because they spend all of their skill points in shit that doesn't actually keep them or anyone else alive.
*'''Monk''' - a kung-fu type warrior (for the [[wapanese]]). At higher levels become fucking invulnerable and kill people in one hit, but everyone's a dumbfuck and plays a fighter instead of these guys.
* '''Paladin''' - A strict code forces these characters to be [[faggots]], much like the players themselves, which results in this being a [[popular]] class among [[nerds]].
*'''Bard''' - Most cyber whores.
*'''Druid''' - Is a [[pagan]] who pretends he can shapeshift but in actuality just puts on a [[fursuit]] and then losses all ability to talk or use weapons - can only [[skritch]]. Games like ''Baldur's Gate II'' had [[fursecution]] as a storyline where [[furries]] attacked the town of Trademeet.
*'''Barbarian''' - Like a fighter, only they're from the [[Middle East|uncivilized lands]] and can declare [[jihad]] about three times per day so they can smack the shit out of everyone else. However, they're generally played by [[retard]]s and black persons.
*'''Sorcerer''' - Wizards with less spells known but more per day and cast off of their [[internet disease|charisma]]. Apparently they're the [[bestiality|spawn of humans and dragons]] which makes them the most commonly played class by [[otherkin]].

=== Other Classes ===
[[Image:dwarf-r.jpg|thumb]]

Some even combine the classes - those types of people are complete fucking [[moron]]s. Other classes which make you a [[faggot|fag]]: 
* '''Assassins''' - Stop looking up girls' skirts, [[pedophile]].
* '''Arcane Archer''' - Clearly for those who have no ingenuity at making builds. Bunch of fairies.
* '''Blackguard''' - Who the fuck plays that?
* '''Champion of Torm''' - Torm exists on ''Aertheca''? Yeah, that's what I thought. Now shut the hell up and admit you took the class for divine wrath.
* '''Dwarven Defiler''' - Stop running around [[naked]].
* '''Harper Scout''' - So fucking [[fail|useless]]
* '''Shifter''' - Why don't you just go fucking [[cosplay]] instead?
* '''Shadowdancer''' - See Assassin.
* '''Weapon Master''' - I like your scythe, greatsword, rapier.

==Terminology==

* [[Pussy|Player]] - Everyone that's on the server to have [[pain|fun]].
* [[Stereotype|Character]] - The waste of time that you, the player, control.
* [[Asshole|DM]] - The wonderful staff members that are there to assure that you have as much [[Shock|fun]] as possible.
* [[Admin]] - The higher staff members that are there to ensure that the DMs are making your life [[Hell|fun]].

==Meet the Staff==

* '''Roo''' - Lead admin. 33 year old [[Aussie]] with 3,000 some posts.
* '''[[disease|Anthrax]]''' - Roo's [[bitch]]. Runs any events which have to do with Seere, and is often found [[torture|torturing]] characters in Bandin. There is substantial [http://www.aertheca.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=1703&g2_imageViewsIndex=1 evidence] suggesting that he enjoys horse anus. 
* '''Dworkin''' - The [[midget|short]] Admin. Dworkin enjoys: 1) Throwing your characters in jail. 2) Never finishing events. 3) Touching horses alongside with Antrhax.
* '''Majestix/Elysium''' - Yes, they are the same person. Excessive [[alcoholism]] has caused him to look like [[Brian Peppers]]. For more information, check out [[Sweden]].
* '''Quaz''' - Very [[fat]].
