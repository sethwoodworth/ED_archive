The '''Insane Clown Pussies''' (Or '''ICP''', for short) are a [[oxymoron|talented white rap group]]. Their first choice for their name was [[CP|"Incestuous Child Pornography"]], but that was already trademarked by [[Catholics|a certain organization]]. Known for their raw portrayal of the hardships of middle-class life in the dangerous [[suburbs]] and for their high-contrast makeup, the ICP astounds critics by continuing to produce what they themselves consider to be music, but what most [[unemployed|musicologists]] consider to be syncopated [[autistic]] tantrums. With their <strike>offensive</strike> predictable lyrics, makeup, merchandising empire, quasi-Christian message (e.g., [[God hates fags]], [[rainbow]]s are magical), and gallons upon glorious gallons of free Faygo, they have amassed a devoted fanbase who are referred to as "[[Juggalo|Juggalos]]", who live their lives in accordance with the teachings of the Posse in order to earn a place in Shangri-La ([[Hell|a Juggalo-only Heaven]]).

[[Some argue]] that this face-painted army is one of the most powerful underground organizations on Earth, and that they inspire [[lulz|fear]] in the hearts of many. After all, there is nothing quite as terrifying than a [[13-year-old boy]] wearing make-up and [[swearing]] in a nine-minute [[YouTube]] video. If you aren't "down with the [[Dick|clown]]," then you best watch your back, because they're packing [[Fleshlight|hatchets]]. Or are they [[Meatspin.com|meat cleavers]]? They aren't quite sure themselves.

==The Band==
[[Image:Insaneclownposse.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Excuse me, sir, you appear to have some [[Santorum]] on your face...]][[Image:Icppaper.jpg|thumb|right|175px]]

Simply put, the Insane Clown Posse are a posse of clowns who are [[Retarded|insane]]. Although their exact [[A frank discussion of mental illness|mental illness]] is [[Furry|unspecified]], an educated guess would be a combination of [[Asperger's Syndrome]], [[Tourette's Syndrome]], [[Down Syndrome]], and barely repressed [[homosexuality]] - the latter manifested in a flamboyant drag act with heavy application of [[semen]]-based makeup, culminating in the symbolic ejaculation of Faygo, a [[Ghetto|cheap soda]] brand, over a crowd of eager [[Shota|teenage boys]]. In a press release, [[Goatse|Joseph Bruce]] (the band's [[Pimp|founding member]]) said that a number of their band members and fans are declared homosexuals and, although he mentioned no names, he added "They're the ones wearing clown make-up."

ICP rose to fame after [[Disney]] kicked them off their record label, Hollywood Records. Disney claimed this was because of "explicit" lyrical content, but it was more likely because they didn't want a bunch of [[fucktard|rebels]] like ICP associated with their [[Incest|fine family entertainment]]. They were thereafter funded by [[Rupert Murdoch|a genuine independent record company owner]] in order to boost their [[Homosexuality|"sellability"]] to the [[Teenagers|masses]]. The band supposedly comes from Detroit, and as a result, thrive like a locust swarm in the suburbs, where more privileged [[fucktard|white teenagers]] and [[virgin|grown men and women]] can [[Emo|pretend that their lives are shit]].

[[PROTIP]]: The fat insane clown is Joseph "Violent Gay" Bruce, Joseph "Faggy 2 Dope" Utsler is the skinny insane clown.

===Music===
[[Image:Fuckingmagnets.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Magic all up in this bitch!]]
Insane Clown Posse's [[Violence|violent]] [[rap]] message, extreme behavior, extreme halitosis, and extensive merchandising range are all the things your mother warned you about clowns with mental health issues, and as such are adored by the [[Bullshit|downtrodden misfits from the bottom rung of society]]. While few of these fans have ever had it as tough as Violent J. in his suburban neighborhood, they nonetheless identify with the profound wisdom they find in the lyrics of their songs such as "I'm a freak show coming to your house, standing at your porch, chewing on a dead mouse," "Your nuts, we want your nuts. Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts (sluts)," and of course "You know what I'm sayin'? I walk into a bitch's house, walk up to they mom, grab 'em by the face and say 'Fuck off!'" Saying "fuck off" to mothers, dirty butts, and chewing on a dead mouse are [[Goatse|some of the many important aspects of day-to-day Juggalo life]].

===Fuckin' Magnets===
{{main|Fuckin' Magnets}}

===[[Howard Stern]] [[Radio]] Show===
In order to understand the mentality of a Juggalo, one must first look at exactly how committed to their violent message the leaders of this notorious gang are. An example of the fearless nature of the Insane Clown Posse was captured on video in 1998 after an interview on the [[Howard Stern]] Show.

<strike>#{{youtube|LKcJv8TRPI0|Violent Gay and Faggy 2 Dope}}</strike> participate in a [[tl;dw|captivating]] [[radio]] interview about their genuine [[Buttsecks|badass nature]] and the frequency with which they commit [[Buttsecks|violent acts]] and go to [[Buttsecks|jail]], because the [[Cops|police]] are always trying to lock up the clowns. Someone calls in and refers to the group as wiggers, which Violent Gay objects to on racial grounds. As a member of the wegro community he is [[Butthurt|outraged]].

<strike>#{{youtube|8Rf-Fdi_p7I|Haters continue to phone in}}</strike> about how much they think the group sucks after the main interview, and they return in to the studio with the typical macho swagger of men wearing make-up. An uppity [[Wigger|nigger]] calls in and makes the ridiculous assertion that ICP are in fact merely imitating black people with their original rap stylings. [[Internet Tough Guy|Tough words]] follow, and the Posse invites him to come to the studio for a free [[Buttsecks|ass-kicking]], Posse-style.

<strike>#{{youtube|6YkBPVd-IPU|A wild negro appears}}</strike>, who works for the show and challenges them on behalf of his primitive race. Despite all the evidence pointing to the fact that they are visibly shitting their pants at this point, it is of course some cunning ruse, possibly to buy time to get their [[Fleshlight|hatchets]]. Or meat cleavers. Faggy 2 Dope rocks in a chair, saying nothing at all, while Violent Gay suddenly remembers that he can't go to jail today and [[Winnar|decides that he doesn't want to fight anymore and wants to be friends]].

The negro community may have [[Winnar|won]] this round, but the [[YouTube]] [[comments]] from Juggalos assure that [[Lie|this man would have been killed]] had they [[Buttsecks|fought]].

===Marketing===
<center><youtube>6khqJ2q9SFo</youtube></center>
Although a [[Lie|completely terrifying underground serial killer movement]], Insane Clown Posse/Hatchetgear/Twiztid/Psychopathic Records manage to sell vast amounts of [[Pain Series|family-friendly]] clothing, footwear, books, stickers, patches, [[Semen|energy drinks]], action figures, and even board games to people looking for ways to assert their [[Sheep|individuality]].

{{tinyquote|there are no requirements to being a Juggalo. We don't care if you spend a dime on merch, or if you know the words to every song. If this music touches you, and you get some positive experience from it, we would be honored to have you consider yourself a Juggalo.|[[Internet|I]][[cp|CP]]}}

Although ICP asserts the above, it certainly couldn't hurt the chances of your immortal Juggalo soul ascending to [[Mexico|Shangri-La]] to stay tuned to their YouTube {{youtube2|PsychopathicVideo|Official Marketing Channel}}, radio show, [[MySpace]] clone, and plethora of other media. Besides, all true [[Fantards|Juggalos]] know that you can only {{youtube|WOQDK6jpFY8|kick a person in the ass or balls in officially licensed Hatchet shoes}}. The ability to paradoxically hate the mainstream while spending your entire paycheck on official manufactured goods because {{youtube|MbT1_Ja4qNY|a man dressed as a fucking clown told you to in a fake news report}} further displays the [[Time paradox|complex duality]] that is the Juggalo mind.

==Chosen Enemies==
[[Image:Coal_Chamber.jpg|thumb|This is Coal Chamber. ICP hates them. It's the girl, I'm sure.]]
[[File:Violent J Report Card.jpg|thumb|200px|Violent Gay's 9th grade teachers were lying, thus making him pissed.]]

For some reason or another, ICP has picked fights with pretty much everyone in the music industry. Here are a few of the "victims" of their "hate".

* [[Eminem]]
* [[Redneck|Kid Rock]]
* [[Slipknot|Korn]]
* [[Britain's Got No Fucking Talent|Sharon Osbourne]]
* [[Metal|Ozzy]]
* [[Goth|Rob Zombie]]
* [[Punk|Dropkick Murphys]]
* [[Incarnate|Kiss]] - ICP accuses them of "stealing their shit", although Kiss' [[Chris-chan|interesting]] look out-dates [[Wigger|ICP]]'s own.
* [[Disney]]
* [[Grunge|Pearl Jam]]
* [[Rage|Rage Against The Machine]] - Called ICP [[truth|poser faggots]] and said they have never felt real pain.
* [[Tool]] - Same reason as Rage Against The Machine.
* [[Down's Syndrome|System of a Down]]
* [[Irish|Flogging Molly]]
* [[Carson Daly]]
* [[Penis|Limp Bizkit]] - For not sucking nearly as bad at what is, more or less, the same type of music.
* [[But you are died!|Coal Chamber]] - Probably the most irrational of them all, as they replaced ICP at one of the Ozzfest concerts in a decision that was far beyond their control,
* [[Furry|Pelicans]] 
* [[Fuckin' Magnets|Scientists]] - Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting them pissed.

==Clowns of God==

== IN THE BEGINNING... ==
The I[[CP]] have been subliminally converting their [[retard]]-ass [[meth]] addict fans to [[Christ]][[faggotry]]. Almost blatantly when they released their recent [[alone|single]], "Miracles", steaming from their latest project-turd, ''Bang Pow Boom''. A huge departure from their usual "work", this somewhat upbeat, thankful song is unexpectedly FERVENTLY AND ANGRILY DEFENDED BY ALL JUGGALOS AS A DEEP AND MEANINGFUL, FUNNY SONG!

Fans and ICP theologians first suspected this through subtle hints left in the "thank you" section of the cover sleeves and the profound, esoteric nature of "Miracles". A song that takes the time to appreciate things like fuckin' gravity, pelicans, magnets, and rainbows, all while disdaining the materialistic perspective on the universe. Little will change for the fans, though. They will continue to call out to God for guidance in-between meth binges and convenience store shifts/robberies. 

The lulz deepened with their latest release, [[Goatse|"Thy Unveiling"]], which has  disenfranchised a significant amount of Juggalos, by hoping that they will find [[shotgun mouthwash|God]]! It's the shittiest [[country]]/[[rap]]/[[rock]] [[bullshit]] ever. It is in the simplest of words, a song written and performed by a middle-aged [[unfunny]] clown named "Violent J.", who reveals that [[God]] is an [[lol wut|evil dark carnival]], and pleads that you should find him. Just watch the fucking thing.

<youtube>OvAi-OBEJm0</youtube>

"Fuck it, we got to tell.

All secrets will now be told

No more hidden messages

…Truth is we follow GOD!!!

We've always been behind him

The carnival is GOD

And may all Juggalos find him

We're not sorry if we tricked you."
