Makhan
[[Image:Aniwapanese.jpg|thumb|Makhan would shit bricks if she was told this.]]
{{deviantart|makhan|Makhan}} is a [[weeaboo]] tracer fgt with [[unwarranted self importance]] who comes from the land of DeviantART, which is the breeding ground of [[tracing]] faggots. She started off drawing [[shitty art]] and [[failed|evolved]] into an even shittier artist. Noticing this, she thought it was a good idea to [[drama|trace other peoples work without citing the original artist or giving credit]]. Because of this, [[Anonymous]] decided to attack Makhan with full force to drive her off of the internet [[for great justice]]. She ended up [[delete fucking everything|taking down all of her art]] and vowed to never come back again. Unfortunately, she is still lurking around on dA and trying to hide all of the comments that were either spam, critique, or just plain [[lulz]].

==How Makhan became a tracer==

[[copypasta|Makhan waited. The lights above her blinked and sparked out of the air. There were critics in the base. She didn't see them, but had expected them now for years. Her warnings to Cernel Joson were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.
Makhan was a deviantART user for fourteen months. When she was young she watched the users draw and she said to dad "I want to be on the site daddy."
Dad said "No! You will BE FLAMED BY CRITICS"
There was a time when she believed him. Then as she got oldered she stopped. But now in the site of deviantART she knew there were critics.
"This is Joson" the radio crackered. "You must fight the critics!"
So Makhan gotted her pms-like rage and blew up the wall.
"HE GOING TO KILL US" said the critics
"I will shoot at him" said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. Makhan plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.
"No! I must flame the critics" she shouted
The radio said "No, Makhan. You are the critics"
And then Makhan was a tracer.]]

===[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|Disregard that I suck cocks]]===

This is how it really happened.

[[LOL WUT|Makhan waited. The lights above her blinked and sparked out of the air. There were tracings in the base. She didn't see them, but had been drawing them now for years. Her warnings to Cernel Joson were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.
Makhan was a tracer for eight or nine years. When she was young she watched the artists and he said to dad "I want to trace the pictures daddy."
Dad said "No! You will BE KILL BY CRITICS"
There was a time when she believed him. Then as she got oldered he stopped. But now in the space station base of deviantart she knew there were tracings.
"This is Joson" the radio crackered. "You must trace the anime!"
So Makhan gotted her compooper and traced the art.
"HE GOING TO TRACE US" said the pictures
"I will spam at her" said the internet superheroes and he fired the desu. Makhan baaawhed at them and tried to get popular. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to trace.
"No! I must trace the pictures" she shouted
The radio said "No, Makhan. You are the tracer"
And then Makhan was an hero.]]

===Tracers? In my Jewtube?===

Someone leaked a video of Makhan playing Guilty Gear XX on [[YouTube]]. Note how she sounds like a retarded [[13-year-old boy|10-year-old]] and sucks at the very game she overhypes about.

==The Shitstorm==

[[Image:Tartletunrealisticexpectation.PNG|thumb|Makhan's thoughts on the Orphaned Works Bill. Also shows her weeaboo fantasy.]]
Once Makhan found out about the Orphaned Works bill, she stated how much it would suck if it were to pass because she has [[Unrealistic Expectations|ambitions of becoming a famous manga arteest]] in the future to get lots of moneys. Of course, this is hard to achieve when all of her work is unoriginal tracings and shitty fanart. When it was noticed that Makunt traced many of her drawings, one person decided to note that she used one of the drawings as a reference. Following this, Makhan decided to hide the comment in fear of being exposed for the fake that she is. This caused the internet hate machine to [[Troll|deliver swift and terrible justice against her]].

===The [[White Knighting|White Knights]]===

Since devianTART is nothing moar than a huge friendzone in which no one is allowed to critique others or tell them that they suck, Makhan was able to queue some of the blind sheep that think her art is [[No|OMG AWESOME]] to fight with her. Any person with common sense would have retaliated by saying "Not your personal army" to her and evaded the spam. Unfortunately, finding commonsense (or originality, amirite?) on dA is like finding [[original content]] on /b/. Some of the [[White Knighting|white knights]] that aided Makhan are:

*{{deviantart|acidbern|Acidbern}} - Gets raided repeatedly because she is an underage Narutard that made the fool mistake of posting in /b/.
*{{deviantart|Isukosa|Isukosa}} - Famous for her "Even though she traced it, it's still her art" bullshit.
*{{deviantart|Haro-Haro|Haro-Haro}} - Stood up for Makunt just to look cool.
*{{deviantart|Joker-Vincent-Taylor|JVT}} - Thinks that tracers should be encouraged to continue their bullshit. Also, he'll suck your cock.

Image:Isukosa3.jpg|But it's still not hers.
Image:Haro haroaskingforit.PNG|Making retarded weeaboo faces just makes you moar of a target.
Image:Jokervincenttaylor1.png|Tracers don't deserve encouragement, you dumb cunt.
</gallery>

A few of them have suffered from massive floods of [[desu]], but not nearly enough to make the GTFO the internets.

====Acidberns faggotry====

When the raid was continuing, Acidbern found the thread on [[Ebaumsworld]] that started the attack. She told Anonymous that she was [[Butthurt|only trying to tell her to ignore them because she didn't want to get violently assraped]]. Unfortunately, this lead to her getting raided day after day until Anonymous grew bored and decided to [[Fap|do something else with his time]].

===The Internet Superheroes===

Despite the fact that many defended Makhan for [[Scientology|her crimes]], she was still overrun with massive spamming, flooding, and all sorts of [[drama]]. Some of the people who [[I did it for the lulz|stood for the lulz]] are:

[[Image:Rokiapwn.PNG|thumb|Inb4 comment hidden by owner.]]
*Rokia -Fought with Anonymous by pointing out Makky's obvious traces. 
*Mr-Destroyer - B&
*prosaicproclamations - B&
*discount-surgeon - B&
*mudkeepz - [[Mudkip|So I herd u liek spamming tracers]]?
*Maxtheechidhog2 - [[Desu]]
*GenericName123 - [[x y is x|Generic name is generic]].
*Anexxion - B&
*cernel-joson - He didn't listen to the warnings.
*joker009 - He is not demons.
*rick-ast - Even rick himself is shocked by this faggotry.
*raptorjesus666 - Our lord and savior joined in battle.
*CrackerJackBarrel - He's surprised that Makhan [[Weeaboo|didn't curse at him in Japanese]].

==The end result==

Since Makhan was only armed with her ability to hide comments and telling people to "get a life", she suffered a humiliating defeat in the end. This lead to Anonymous' temporary victory and one Anonymous calling this "The Great DevianTART Troll of 2008". But to this day, she can be found [[Delete Fucking Everything|hiding the comments on her profile]] to make it look like nothing happened. 

==Potential meme that spawned from this lulzy event==

[[Image:Ohexploitable.PNG|thumb|The face from "her" pieces of "art". Use it when trolling a tracer or for shits and giggles.]]
Over the course of action, one Anonymous decided to make the face on one of her drawings [[Oh exploitable|exploitable]].  When Anonymous found out about this, he shopped the face into many images in order to generate lulz. The meme was short lived, but can be revived if people had the ambition to use it [[moar]] often.
