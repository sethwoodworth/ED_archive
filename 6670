'''Psyguy''', aka "Spycho", aka "[http://themagictalkingwall.sheezyart.com/ The Magic Talking Wall]", is an [[internet celebrity]], [[aspie]] and a victim of unwarranted self importance in his mid twenties that runs the [[webcomic]]/[[furry]] cesspool, ''[http://www.fireball20xl.com Fireball 20XL]'' He is known for writing [[unfunny|very long and involved webcomics]] and "hiring" [[fanboys]]...er, artists, to draw and/or sprite them [[shit nobody cares about|in exchange for being "featured" on his site]]. However, should you slight him in the tiniest way, expect to be banned and then [[flame war|flamed]] all over his [[LJ]]: http://notpsylols.livejournal.com/. Any emails you send will also be posted there, and your life will be TEH RUINED!!1[[oneone]] The LiveJournal was previously reallylucky.livejournal.com, but his mommy and daddy told him to take it down, so now he secretly types journal entries under his new alias. What a [[retard|clever boy]].

The comics usually focus on ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Legend of Zelda]]'', or a random assortment of [[shit nobody cares about|his own original characters]] and [[Nintendo]] characters. HOWEVER, even though the comic itself seems to be focused on famous copyrighted characters, somehow Psyguy always seems to make his own character (which is a cross between ''Dragonball Z'' and ''Sonic'' on methamphetamines) the main focus of the story.  Mostly though, the whole thing is a useless collection of [[unfunny]] copyright infringement, but the [[retard|fanboys]] love it and spam his shit all over the [[internets]]. 80% of his characters are either created by others or modified version of copyrighted character that he calls original.

He has also had a number of [[whore|girlfriends]] (somehow). In a year he dates about twenty girls (on the internets). It ends with him writing an emo poem about the girl[http://www.sheezyart.com/view/845009/] and then talking shit about them. His dumbass friends defend him saying it's not his fault. Somehow it's always the girl's fault. Many believe the reason Psy can never work a relationship with a girl is because he is really [[faggot|gay]] and just can't admit it.

Psy also has problems keeping friends, because it appears that he is [[aspergers|insecure]]. He relieves his stress by taking out his anger on everyone else, because he lives an extremely stressful life drawing Mario and Sonic's bastard lovechildren and [[furfag|masturbating to furry pornography]] on his shitty Macintosh computer.

Much to the surprise of the community, it was recently discovered that he no longer lives with his parents! They still get assaulted with daily phone calls for him, but much to the dismay of all his [[Newbie|fans]], though they refuse to give out his information.  [[Disregard that|Actually, he admitted he faked that by sounding like his dad.  Whoops!]]  He'll also come after you with [[Internet Law|the law]] if you so much as '''think''' about calling him.

Psyguy also has a problem with people who used to do content for his site but left because they know that being on his site is like being a member of a cheap prostitution ring. Most notably is Dazz who runs The Spriter's Resource and is often brought up [http://fireball20xl.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&id=1232583802&archive=&start_from=&ucat=& by Psyguy on his site] because he has nothing else to talk about. He also thinks that he's hilarious and amazing because he stopped getting replies after [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Last_thursday people stopped giving two shits].

==Psyguy Rip-Offs==

[[Image:Psy.gif|thumb|right|Psyguy's previous character design, masterfully rendered in three-dee.]]

Psy has more then once claimed of people ripping off his rip-off characters. He'll make a post on his LJ and complain about his [[lie|"original"]] characters being ripped off by others. The following are what Psy considers as ripping off his character.

*swirly eyes
*green skin
*small penis
*dbz clothing
*wings
*hedgehog
*furry
*no nose
*eyes
*arms
*hands
*legs
*feet
*head
*just about anything really

Do any of the following and Psy will be sure to make an LJ post about your rip-off character.

===Psyguy Wears Dark Sunglasses At Night===
Some time in late 2007, Psyguy decided to ditch his fluffy green Sonic knock-off for something even more blatantly gay.  An upgrade from "furfag," his persona is presently a [http://psyguy.deviantart.com/art/Psyguy-design-2007-68955492 <s>mutant</s> demon ''Phoenix Wright'' character with sunglasses]. (See above.)  While this is a surprising change, it doesn't change the fact that he still has no original ideas of his own.  And no nose.  Or penis.

==Comics by Psy==
{{spoilers|text=Knuckles and Rouge ''die'' in ''Chaos Diamonds 3'' but they magically come back to life when Sonic [[lol|smashes the diamond out of Tails's forehead]]}}
===That's My Sonic!===
Most likely the only thing people are going to remember that Psy did (If people will even remember him). Some say it's the origin on all sprite comics using incredibly unfunny Sonic jokes.

He later brought it back only to fuck it up even more than it was to begin with.

===Get Blue Spheres===
Another crappy comic about Sonic. But what is even more sad is that Psy [[lazy|hired another person to SPRITE IT]]. We all know Psy doesn't draw his comic cause he sucks at drawing and is lazy as hell. But if you are also too lazy to sprite a comic then you fail.

===Chaos Diamonds 3===
Written by Psy and drawn by one of his many slaves. The story is about Tails being emo since Sonic left him. Your basic Tails growing up and Sonic becoming a dick fanfic. Tails finds a diamond that turns him into Psy (Psy did this to make his e-penis feel bigger). It's pretty much crappy emo Sonic fanfic.  It ends with Amy and Tails hooking up, Knuckles and Rouge dead, Sonic still a douche, and the Chaos Diamonds eaten by Denver the Last Dinosaur.  [[LOL|Lawl]].

===Red & Black===
Pretty much the same shit as ''Chaos Diamonds 3'' but with Shadow as the focus. More emo shit and Amy being a fucking [[slut]] falling for Shadow now instead of Tails.

===Wha-CHOW!===
Not a comic but a crappy radio show Psy does with his friends. They talk about stupid shit and think they're being funny as hell. It's full of inside jokes and Psy talking about his asshole cause ass jokes are funny to him (as it's his favorite part to get things shoved in).

===Items on High===
Another unoriginal and unfunny comic by Psyguy only this one makes fun of ''[[Super Smash Bros|Super Smash Bros.]]'' rather than ''Sonic''. Like all of his other comics it`s unfunny, unoriginal and just plain stupid, ironically he puts Sonic in only to realize it was stupid so he fucked the whole thing up and quit.

===Real Men Use Items===
[[Super Smash Bros.|Take the same comic and add minor differences. JUST LIKE IN THE GAMES!]]  Though there is a key difference in that instead of using edited sprites, Psy uses [[screencaps]] for his panels so he can be even more [[lazy]] than usual.

== Videos by Psy ==
Like most of his shitty comics, he makes shitty videos based on copyrighted shows and games. Can`t he be original for once? Well in order to make these shitty videos, he needs his slaves, some shitty sound effects, and some crappy music (which were awesome before he used em). After that he has a shitty video with terrible voice acting and a bunch of stupid jokes. Lets face it - he`ll never be funny.....EVER!

Don't believe me? This video confirms everything in this article. You would think making ''[[Sonic]] Sprite'' [[porn]] and starting a [[furry]] community based around a ruined franchise would be enough insanity for one guy. Apparently puppets are just icing on the [[cake]]. [[Shit Bricks|You'll shit bricks]].

===Bastardized series===
Psyguys version of [[Youtube poop]] but with more fail.

===[[World of Warcraft]]===
A bunch of stupid clips of Psyguy playing [[world_of_warcraft|WoW]]. Adds Mario sounds in an attempt to make it [[fail|"funny"]].

===How to make Sprite Comics/Effects===
A shitty guide to making a good comic. Avoid it like the plague.

==HEZ MAD! OH NOEZ!==
[[Last Thursday]] Psy commented on his article.

''Psyguy (the one who's writing this right now) has a lot of cowards write relatively funny things about him in an attempt to de-fame him. But, [[Lie|they will never, ever, e-mail him under any circumstance]]. Psyguy (again, who's writing this) openly takes e-mails and [http://notpsylols.livejournal.com/499632.html will be more than happy to talk to you about any problems you may have]. It's not healthy to sit and harbor on bad and nasty feelings that make you call him gay.''

''[[Bullshit|Seriously guys, I don't give a flying fuck what you put online. You all don't like me? I don't give a shit.]] It's fucking stupid though - because I'll be more than happy to talk to you one on one. Shit like this only makes me laugh and helps me get more visitors to my site.''

''Go ahead! Make a THOUSAND posts on different websites about me! They -all- link to my page, you jackasses! That's what I WANT! I openly mock myself on my "radio-show" all the time. You think something like this is going to mildly hurt me?''

''I'M ON THE SHITTER RIGHT NOW TYPING THIS. I have my pants around my ankles and a nice big shit just came out of my ass. My computer, right now, is dangerously close to my very small and flaccid penis! Of course, I'm not looking at gay porn / child pornography - so it is something out of the norm.''

''Is that all you idiots got? Bitch about me on some page. Oh boo hoo my wonderful reputation shall be tarnished and no one will like me :'(''

''My e-mail is psyguy@gmail.com.''

This statement has lead to many not giving a shit. At the moment the cowards that wrote this article only had to say "It's the internet. Who cares?" Obviously they don't understand that to Psy, [[the Internet is serious business]].

==Psyguy's Biggest Fans==
*[http://www.furaffinity.net/user/filthy/ Filthy Animal] - Psyguy's loyal and devoted servant, willing to suck his cock whenever he demands so. Like Psyguy, is morbidly obese and is a furry.  Recently found out Psy is a big, fat loser but still obsesses over him.
*[http://the-wise-mankey.livejournal.com/ The Wise Mankey] - Another servant of Psyguy who occasionally does sprite shit for him as well. He's a closet pedophile and homosexual, a furry (His avatar is a human body with a mankey head that wears a trenchcoat and camo pants), dramafag and self-diagnosed [[aspergers|aspie]] among other things. In short, the epitome of anti-lulz.

==Psyguy's Slaves==
*[http://www.trg.fireball20xl.com Mr.OMA] - AKA: Oral MAsturbater. Unlike Psyguy, OMA is funny in comparison (But then again, anyone is) and doesn't use copyrighted characters in every comic...or at least doesn't fucking make a comic on them (EX: Sonic).
*[http://www.tta.fireball20xl.com Kirbopher15] - The creator of the shit flash series TTA and Psyguy's sex slave. Although TTA is a shitty flash movie at least it`s more original than what Psy does (which must be the reason for him being his sex slave)...but of course you later realize its a complete ripoff of .Hack/MMBN/DBZ with horrible voice acting and terrible music quality. Could use an article, especially considering that as of now he hangs out with [[Rina-chan|his whore of a girlfriend]].
*[http://www.lashiec.com/uom.html Ame] - The only one that can actually draw unlike everyone else on the damn site. She used to be a [[furfag|furry]] but after realizing how much furries sucked she went on being human. Psy later assraped her and made her his slave again.
