Dragon
'''Dragons''' have been known all over the world as amazing creatures.

[[File:Dragon awesome.jpg|thumb|Dragons are sick of your shit.]]
In Europe, Dragons [[so cash|have all the gold and bitches they want]]. They spend their free time Jew, [[Homestar Runner|burninating the countryside]], murdering the shit out of anything not a dragon, and generally being awesome. 

In [[Japan|Asia]] Dragons are one of the four great animal gods. These mighty immortal creatures swoop down to [[pwn|rain bloody justice]] down upon the [[you|wicked]] while [[Ghost Riding|riding gracefully on the wind]]. When not going [[batman|supernatural vigilante]] on the world, [[China|Asian]] dragons spend their time fighting fucking [[tiger]]s.

Even the [[Bible]] recognizes dragons as badass!

Sadly, all this recognition has seeped into the intertubes, leading to dragons being constantly associated with [[LittleCloud|complete]] [[Scion|fucking]] [[DracoGuard|idiots]]. What once was one of the most [[awesome]] animals ever, is now overrun by [[retarded]] [[otherkin]], angsty [[16 year old girls|internet dwellers]] and [[faggot]]y [[furfag]]s. 

== Dragons in [[Furry]] Culture ==

Furries noticed how awesome dragons are, and, having [[fail at life|Zero self-confidence]] and [[Brian Peppers|Boatloads of ugly]], wished they were half as awesome. So, in responce, they started to make fail-tastic dragon [[fursona]]s.

Inevitably, these "dragons" are....
* [[furry|Humanoid]]
* [[sick fuck|Sexually Idealized]] [[Mary Sue]]
* owned by a basement-dwelling college age [[fatass]]
* Loaded with [[Unwarranted self importance]]
* [[godmoding|godmode]] constantly 

Mix it all together and you get 500 pound lardos pretending to be dragons just to make the pain of nobody wanting them go away so they can [[hugbox|feel special]]. Feeling they are better than everyone else, "dragons" like to organize special dragon only [http://dragons.meetup.com/17/ meet ups], and write articles in which they [http://www.boingboing.net/2004/11/22/werewolf_and_furry_b.html speak for God] to the [[Christian furry]] community.

Of course, the bible doesn't approve of dragon worship at all, and any real [[christian]] (read: NOT A FURRY) knows it. 

''Revelation 13:4 And they worshiped the dragon which gave power [[satan|unto the beast]].'' 

'''Translation''': Worshiping dragons is the same as worshiping Satan.

''Revelation 16:13-14 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the [[satan|mouth of the beast]], and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of [[devil]]s, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.''

'''Translation''': Any "dragon" who says they speak for god are full of shit. They are instead gathering an army for Satan at Armageddon by recruiting believers with false miracles.

==Otherkin Dragons==

At first glance, otherkin dragons and furry dragons are the same. They are both played by 500 pound lardos pretending to be dragons just to make the pain of nobody wanting them go away so they can [[hugbox|feel special]], you know! However, there are a few important differences.
Otherkin...
*[[batshit insane|think they are dragons]]
:* Typically play [[transexual|herm]]s and use the [[hir|sie]] or [[hir|shi]] pronoun.
*[[bestiality|do not use humanoid dragons]]
*[[serious business|get even more offended than a furry would if you tell them dragons aren't real]]
* Regularly have mental disorders such as [[assburgers]] or [[schizophrenia]] which may or may not be medicated.

So, where a [[furry]] simply pretends to be a dragon in order to be laid and knows they are actually humans, an otherkin is literally insane and believes they really are a dragon and that dragons are real. They also are even more into [[bestiality]] than furries are as they don't bother adding any human traits to their "dragon selves".

Typically, the story is that their dragon form is a female on a far away planet who lives/lives in a perfect dragon body. The dragon [[An Herpo|got sick and died]] or is [[psychic|astral projecting]] in order to continue life in another form. Upon dying, they will get their dragon forms back and go to live in beauty and splendor forever.

'''Protip''': Don't wait, [[an hero|Kill yourself]] [[DO IT FAGGOT|so you can become a dragon right now!]]

== Dragons in  Internet Culture ==

[[Camwhore]]s often acquire [[tattoo]]s of dragons. These can be placed near private body parts which are [[I accidentally X|accidentally]] exposed during the taking of the picture.  They are also popular for [[white]] people who want to look [[Azn]]. They Phail. 

More important than just having a tattoo of a dragon, however, is telling everyone about the full body dragon tattoo that the camwhore is going to get some day in order to jack all your paper by saying  "[[internet poor|plz donate]]" so they can afford to get the tattoo. Congrats, you're looking at their only job skill: begging.

Regular whores like to draw dragon or use dragons in their names in an attempt to sound "cool". Of course, anyone who would fixate so strongly on dragons is a sad loser with [[no life]], so by trying to use dragons to further themselves, they have defeated the purpose. 

==== Special mention: Trogdor ====
''Trogdor the Burninator'' was an [[unfunny]] [[flash]] video at the even more unfunny [[Homestar Runner]]. It became an [[old meme]] three days after the file debuted but continues to influence the [[internets]]. Many [[nerd]]s own T-shirts with Trogdor's likeness on them.  Because they never leave the house, they tend to take pictures of themselves in the shirt to post to their [[LiveJournal]]s.  

Variants of the word "Burninate" - such as baninated - are a continued aspect of [[unfunny]] internet culture.  (''See [[Encyclopedia_Dramatica:Block_log]]'')
