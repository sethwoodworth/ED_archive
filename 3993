'''In before X''', always spelled "in b4" or "inb4," is a [[lulz|corruption]] of the [[Occupatio]] technique which presumably originated on [[4chan]] [[nobody cares|too long ago for anyone to remember]] ([[at least 100]] years ago), but has since spread like wildfire over the Internets. It is used as a [[First post|first reply]] to meme-baiting posts in order to thoroughly [[rape]] the noob who started the thread as well as ruin the fun of all future posters to that thread. Unfortunately, faggots generally carry on regardless.


== Usage ==
In before X (sometimes "inb4 X") is most often used as the first reply to a [[thread]] or [[comment]], and only if that thread or comment is bait: that is, there is [[at least 100|at least a 100%]] chance that someone else will reply to the [[OP]] using a particular [[meme]], [[flame]], or [[Final solution|solution]]. Saying "in before X", where X is ''not'' the anticipated response in question, is [[You are doing it wrong|doing it wrong]].

The intent of the OP is irrelevant. Even if he's completely ignorant of whatever he's baiting, he is STILL [[Asking for it|baiting it]].

In before X is a troll's way of bragging that he got to a thread before the anticipated reply could be posted, thus mocking all future posters to that thread for their [[retard|slowness]].

[[retard|If you didn't understand that:]] The poster after the OP is basically saying "I posted before someone posted X so nyah nyah." See the examples.

Sometimes, the [[Original Poster|OP]] tries to inb4 in his own post, because he wrote [[Shit nobody cares about|some bullshit]]. In that case, [[You|he]] is a [[faggot]].

The most common usage you'll see of this on [[4chan]] is on a [[CP]] thread where you'll see a storm of [[faggot|people]] saying "in before [[404]]" and using tons of [[Image Macro|image macros]] to express that this thread has not yet been closed by an [[Administrator]] and is still viewable.

It is also best to note that saying "inb4 I love you more" in context with talking to your girlfriend is complete fucking fail and makes you a huge faggot.

;'''OP:''' "[[Anonymous]] got my phone number and address! What should I do?"
;'''Reply:''' "In before buy a dog."
:In this example, OP's post is [[clearly]] bait for the "[[Buy A Dog|buy a dog]]" meme. However, any post that ends in "What should I do?" on [[b|/b/]] is also bait for "a [[barrel roll]]" and "become [[an hero]]," since these are both training-wheel memes that most newfags pick up on right away and parrot incessantly. Because of this, most advice-seeking posts are ended with "in b4 an hero barrel roll etc." to try and combat this faggotry.

;'''OP:''' "halp plz sum1 stole my [[Mitchell Henderson|ipod]]."
;'''Reply:''' "In before [[an hero]]."

;'''OP:''' "LOL is a corruption of Lulz."
;'''Reply:''' "In before [[doing it wrong]]."

;'''OP:''' "You are just as bad as the [[Holocaust]] deniers!"
;'''Reply:''' "In before [[Fifty Hitler Post]]."
:Note: <del>it is still appropriate to perform a Fifty Hitler Post even if someone calls an in-before</del>. It is always appropriate to perform a [[Fifty Hitler Post]].

;'''OP:''' "I am depressed, /b/. What should I do?"
;'''Reply:''' "In before become an hero"
:Note: it is still appropriate to perform an hero even if someone calls an in-before.

;'''OP:''' [posts CP]
;'''Reply:''' "In before 404", "In before Pedobear" or "In before Chris Hansen"

== Effect ==
[[Image:Inb4newfag.jpg|thumb|Newfag.]]
[[Image:Inb4self.jpg|thumb|A [[Typical|rare]] case of "In before" as protection.]]
If "In before" has been properly invoked, then any future poster who wishes to bring up X in the thread runs the risk of looking like a total idiot, and having all other posters mock him/her for being as much. A common [[n00b]] mistake is to bring up X after "In before" has already been called, resulting in the n00b being laughed out of the thread, too humiliated to show his IP there again.


[[Image:Inb4yiff.PNG|thumb|In b4 furfaggotry.]]
There are however few cases when it's ok to bring up X after an "In before." If the poster is trying to protect themselves from backlash, for example someone admits they are a [[furry]] but says [[Doing it wrong|"in before 'yiff in hell furfag.'"]]  In this case it is <s>perfectly acceptable and encouraged</s> mandatory to let the furfag have it anyway.

==Related phrases==
The obvious corollary to "In before" is "In after."  This is used most often when someone has mentioned X after an "In before" was called on it.  Less common is "In during." For example, "In during shitstorm" or "In during newfags getting trolled."  "In during" is used to separate [[Elitist|yourself]] from the rest of the posters in a thread, because like, you totally ''knew'' the OP was trolling, and that wasn't you that posted a minute ago flipping your shit because he asked for [[Rule 34]] on [[Yotsuba|"404 girl."]]
