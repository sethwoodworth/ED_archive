Original fiction
'''Original fiction''' is a form of writing that lacks in both supporting documentation and factual content. This includes fables, fabrications, <s>[[fellatio]]</s>, fairy tales, fakes, falsehoods, <s>[[Fallacy|fallacies]]</s>, fantasies, fibs and flat-out felonious frauds, as long as nobody else has ever before created a similar lie. If somebody else has previously created a similar lie, then the writings are called ''plagiarism'' or, if properly referenced, ''research''.<br/><br/>Despite this, it is still infinitely better than [[fanfiction]], and as a result is constantly violently [[rape]]d by 13 year old girls with more ambition than talent.
