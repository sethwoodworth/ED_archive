The Not-So-Great Syringe Meme of 2005
[[Image:Ohnoesdmca.gif|frame|[[Copyright infringement]] is [[serious business]].]]
The syringe [[meme]] all started [[at least 100 years ago]] when {{lj|user=zhzhblyad}} made her boyfriend (gay cover) take an [[icon]] of [[Bestiality|animal loving]] [[fucktard]] {{lj|user=brn_eyd_grl}}'s [[dog]] in a party hat, and [[Photoshop]]ped a syringe and red eyes into the [[image]] Ã  la {{lj|user=zhzhblyad}}'s trademark [http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/39276025/1503316 dope fiend chihuahua icon].

She pretended not to care until [[User:Thespoony|thespoony]] stole the altered icon, sending {{lj|user=brn_eyd_grl}} into a hissy fit and causing her to leave {{ljcomm|user=brutal_honesty}}. When he refused to take it down, she slapped him and {{lj|user=zhzhblyad}} with a [[DMCA]] notification because her dogs were like her children or some lame [[shit]]. Under the advice of his [[Internet lawyer]], [[Hardvice]], Spoony filed a counter-notification citing the DMCA [[Fair use|parody clause]]. To be safe, they both took down the icon until [[LJ Abuse]]'s time limit for a counter-notification expired.

Then, [[User:Bastardman|some other fag]] thought it would be a great idea to add text to the icon, and [[STD|spread it around]]. Soon enough, everyone was adding syringes, red eyes and party hats to their own icons, even people who had no idea what it meant, forging a meme that would last <strike>a lifetime</strike> about five minutes.

{{lj|user=brn_eyd_grl}} would later [[Deleting your LiveJournal|delete her journal]], only to undelete it shortly thereafter and [[Friends only|friends lock]] the whole thing. Her dogs and husband remain [[ugly]], even to this day.
