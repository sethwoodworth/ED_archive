Archaeology

Archaeology is [[fail|clawing through the dustbin of history]], or, alternatively, [[LOLWUT|the most fun you can have with your pants on]]. [http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeologistsquotes/qt/quote212.htm] [[Lie|Archaeology guarantees you a job after University]]. [http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/08/uk_contract_archaeology_in_dee.php]. The most commonly used tools in archaeology are the [[penis|trowel]] and dynamite. Archaeology has been the preserve of the retired, liberal children, and [[fail|those not good enough to study history]].

==Great archaeological discoveries==

Several bits of wood on Mount Ararat prove the existence of [[ITTY BITTY BABY ITTY BITTY BOAT|Noah's Ark]]<br>
The Kensington Stones prove that [[Minnesota]] was invented by the Vikings<br>
The Maine Penny proves that [[Maine]] was invented by the Vikings<br>

The gold tablets of [[fundies|Mormon]]<br>
[[arab|Tutankhamun]] comes back to life to find [[mexico|Patricia Velasquez]]<br>


==Jerusalem==

Jerusalem has always been completely Jewish and archaeology has proved it. Palestinian buildings (technical term "grave fill") have been cleared away to show that there is only one archaeological level in Jerusalem, namely that of the Kingdom of David and the 1st Millennium BC [http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/05/archaeology_misused_in_jerusal.php]. So there.

==Rome==

[[Mussolini]] tore away all of Rome's bogus medieval history to show the only archaeology that matters. The Roman Empire. The 12th Century Commune of Rome, opposing the temporal power of the higher nobles was, well, [[communist]] and therefore deleted for disobedience of TOS.  Mussolini was the first IRL [[moderator|Forum Moderator]].

==Egypt==

{{squote|For 18 centuries the [[Jews]] were dispersed throughout the world. They went to [[America]] and took control of its economy. [[WTC|They have a plan]]. Although they are few in number, [[hitler|they control the entire world... they are always united over a single view. They always move together, even if in the wrong direction.... Look at the control they have over America and the media.... It was unity that gave them this power]]. The concept of killing [[bitch|women]], [[loli|children]] and [[old|elderly people]]... seems to run in the blood of the Jews of [[Palestine]]. In fact, it seems to have become part of the false faith of this people, who is tormenting us in our own [[egypt|homeland]]. When I speak of the Jewish faith, I do not mean their original faith, but the faith that they forged and contaminated with their poison, which is aimed against all of [[islam|mankind]]... The only thing that the Jews have learned from history is methods of tyranny and torment - so much so that they have become artists in this field. They have done to the Palestinians what [[rap|Pharaoh]] and Sargon of [[syria|Akkad]] did to the Jews...}} 

Zahi Hawass [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawass], [[arab|Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities]] and all round [[attention whore]], proving that he better learn his stupid history: Sargon of [[Iraq|Akkad]] never did ''anything'' to the Jews '''because they fucking didn't exist at that time''' (~ 2,340 BCE).

==Mecca==

The [[islam|Black Stone in the Kaaba at Mecca]] has been identified as;

*a statue of a Moon God [http://www.bible.ca/islam/islam-moon-god-hubal.htm] - [[Christian]] propaganda
*a Hindu temple [http://www.hinduism.co.za/kaabaa.htm] - [[Hindu]] propaganda
*the Earth Goddess [http://volker-doormann.org/the4.htm] - [[hippy]] propaganda
*a [[vulva]] [http://66.102.9.132/search?q=cache:tVr2HmJDi-wJ:www.aididsafar.com/shegod.html+kaaba+penis&cd=10&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk&client=firefox-a]
*a [[penis]] [http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090806205142AAT6nw3]
*a [[Richard Dawkins|meteorite]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba]

Surely all this could be sorted out by a good dose of  archaeology? It would be unfortunate if the millions of pilgrims on Hajj  (busy being ripped off by Saudi hotel owners and shop-keepers) were merely kissing a giant black penis. 

Luckily in [[Saudi Arabia]] {{squote|Archaeologists are cautioned not to talk about pre-Islamic finds outside scholarly literature}} so that's that [http://blog.taragana.com/e/2009/08/30/risking-islamic-ire-saudi-arabia-opens-a-rich-history-to-foreign-archaeologists-29200/]. Besides, think of the tourism.

==Wikipedia==

There are many archaeological levels in Wikipedia. Dig down far enough and you'll find (a) the origins of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], (b) [http://web.archive.org/web/20020128113110/wikipedia.com/wiki/The_Wikipedia_Guard antique articles about the Wikipedia Militia] and (c) [[Rachel Marsden]]

==Drama!==

[[England|Britfag]] website [http://www.bajrfed.co.uk/forum.php/ BAJR] a clearing house for UK [[Retard|archaeologists]] was successfully trolled [[last thursday]] by a heroic [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|whistle blower]] who broke libel user policy online while regaling a [[For great justice|story]] how corrupt [[Bullshit|consultant]] [[Vagoo|Duncan Hawkins]] was [[rape|foiled]] attempting to circumnavigate planning regulations on a very important [[shit|excavation]] and how much [[lulz]] was had [[IRL]]

===Moar Drama! Fear my industry standard tracking service===

[[Image:Trackservice.png|thumb|]]
A combination of [[Fail|EPIC]] fixed IP [[Sock puppet|sock puppetry]] and [[fail|industry standard tracking service]] has produced copious pathetic [[Fail]] of such  a [[high score]] it boarders on [[anti-lulz]]. The lack of  [[Masturbation|ordinary skillz]] displayed by the admin and users of this ineffectual shite-pipe mirrors the current [[Tubgirl|high standards]] in professional archaeology today.

The following is only funny because it is unfairly directed against Americans. An impartial and not remotely hysterical US  [http://www.vcoins.com/fax/ coin dealer] writes;

{{squote|Imports of Roman coins to the USA are not [[banned]] - not yet.  But if we don't act before 22 April, if [[you|YOU]] donâ€™t act now, it could happen.  [[Nigeria|Click the link at the bottom of this email]] and use the easy [[Paypal|ACCG Fax Wizard]] to let our government know they must not ban imports of coins of Italian origin.  The U.S. and Italy currently have a [[pwn|Memorandum of Understanding]] ([[cow|MOU]]) that restricts imports of [[pizza|antiquities]] of Italian origin.  [[Italy]] claims they own this "cultural property" and it must be confiscated and returned to the Italian government.  The MOU currently does not include coins but if we remain silent coins will be added to the [[law|import restrictions]] when the MOU is renewed this spring.  [[Roman]] coin imports to the USA will be banned. If coins are added to the MOU, "Italian" ancient coins you purchase from dealers in Germany, the UK, or even [[Canada]] might be presumed to be the property of the Italian government.  Unless you can prove your coins were exported from Italy before 1970 or you have an export permit from the Italian government, [[bubba|your coins could be confiscated and "returned" to Italy.  You could even be accused of purchasing "stolen property."]]  More likely, dealers outside the USA will simply refuse to ship to the USA.  Your favorite coin dealers in the USA will face the same restrictions.  [[catnarok|Inventories will fall, shops will close, prices will rise]], and fewer coins will be available for collectors. There will be no restrictions on shipping ancient coins within the EU, so this cultural [[man|patrimony]] claim is [[lol|targeted only at Americans]], who presumably [[true|steal the heritage of Italy by buying Roman and other "Italian" ancient coins]].  We must tell our government that the coins of Rome and the ancient civilizations of Italy are not just the [[porn|cultural heritage]] of Italians; they are the [[money|cultural heritage]] of all [[America|humanity]], including Americans.  We must tell our government that we [[Internet Tough Guy|should not be denied]] the opportunity to buy ancient coins just because we are [[mexican|American]].  We must tell our government that [[Unwarranted Self Importance|our children should not be deprived of learning the learning experience ancient coins provide]] just because they are American.}}

==Archaeology as Science==

{{squote|I consider a mistake one of the humanity's belive, caused by religion and social enviroments, the fact that "until proof" we have the daring to consider ourselves the only intelligent life forms in the Universe.
And yes I do not have evidence to support what I belive at this point, neighter do astrobyologists and astronomers arround the world, still that does not make them less proffesional then an archaeologist.
And until eveidence how much an archaeologist has to work? Having evidence does not automatically prove or disprove a theory or opinion.
Ultimatelly there are puzzle pieces that must be put together to prove something.<br>
That is my opinion anyway.}}

==The economics of antiquities==

In the good old days before [[law|law and order]], "[[wogs|locals]]" used to sell  antiquities to whichever [[cunt|rich bloke]] wandered past. Then the [[australia|Victorians]] decided that [[arab|foreigners]] were not to be trusted with antiquities, and [[pwn|stole]] them all to put in the [[london|British Museum]] for [[white]] people to [[fap|look]] at. Now [[cracker|we're]] giving antiquities back [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8606458.stm], and so the status quo is restored. Antiquity goes to [[iraq|shit country]], [[afghanistan|shit country]] has [[saddam|change of government]], antiquity is [[win|looted]] and then sold to some [[David Cameron|rich bloke]]. [[meme|Perfectomundo]]. (The alternative is the [[lol|Taliban]] who just blow antiquities up [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1197900.stm], [[allah akbar]].)

==How not to [[troll]] Archaeologists==

Don't ask them these questions as it flatters them into thinking they are sexy;

*Are you afraid of snakes?
*Which designer makes the best fedoras?
*How many traps have you triggered?
*How many Nazis have you killed in your line of work?
*Can I have fries with that?
