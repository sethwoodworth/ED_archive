B1FF

One of the most ingenious trolls ever, '''B1FF''' represented the prototypical [[n00b]].  During the early 80s, B1FF was a young 13-year-old boy who posted on [[usenet]] using his brother's VIC-20.  B1FF was also a denizen of BITNET.  He would write all his post in caps, typos, and net abbreviations (EVRY BUDY LUVS GOOD OLD BIFF CUZ HE"S A K00L DOOD AN HE RITES REEL AWESUM THINGZ IN [[CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL|CAPITULL LETTRS]] LIKE THIS!!!)

The impact of B1FF has been devastating.  What started at the dawn of the [[internets]] as a simple amusement became the template of [[netspeak]] used by [[script kiddie]]s, [[h4X0r]]s, and [[warez|wArEz d00dz]], proving yet again that jokes can indeed be taken too far -- until they are jokes no more.
