If you're an ED veteran, you might be saying to yourself, "Oh, big deal, it's the internet, [[Diaper fetish|diaper fetish]]es are [[Sonmanic|nothing new]]". The thing to realize is that '''Deeker''' is not just another diaper lover. He's a diaper lover with pedophilic and quasi-incestuous interests combined with a cult leader. Deeker doesn't just want to write about an eight year-old boy being changed by his sisters while having an erection; he wants the entire world to follow his vision of a diaper-wearing utopia. You think we're exaggerating? Not this time.

[[what|Also he really hates pants.]]

==About Deeker==

Deeker is an adult man who pretends to be eight years old and supposedly gets his jollies from his [[incest|mom and sisters]] changing him.  He's into hard rock, movies, bowling, skiing, and computers. He has two cats and works at a call center. Oh, and he's earned a reputation for being a freak among [[adult babies]]. [http://anonym.to/?http://www.adisc.org/wiki/index.php/Deeker Yes, grown men who pretend to be babies are embarrassed by this guy.]

==Site History==

The year was '96. While most normal people were saving up for a Tickle-Me-Elmo and listening to The Spice Girls, one man was creating an empire. Not happy with simply playing on his Tamagotchi and watching the twentieth century draw to a close, Dan Cosby grabbed himself a Push-Pop, kicked off his Doc Martens and founded a [[web 1.0]] site to share his glorious hobby with the world.

[http://www.deeker.com/ Deeker.com] is an inexplicably-long vanity page in which grown men can come together and share their thoughts and experiences of boys in diapers. Not girls though, because that would be weird. Over the fourteen years it has been running, it has received acclaim and outrage in equal measure, though please note that this is almost exclusively from others within the [[sick fuck]] community so outrage is [[double nigger|exponentially magnified]], seeing as the source is outrageous.

==Website==
[[File:Deeker_Clean_body.gif|thumb|300px|example from the art gallery]]

Deeker has been running his [http://deeker.com website] since 1996. That's nearly 15 years of horror.

Unfortunately for [[EDiot|our researchers]], the site makes [[geocities]] look good. Deeker.com features unnecessary tables, frames, changing background colors, [http://www.deeker.com/parents.html orphaned pages that haven't been updated for 8 years] and every other possible mistake that could be cured by two weeks at the local [[RCHS|community college]].

Deekerites, as they're called apparently, visit deeker.com for all their diaper needs. There's [http://www.deeker.com/deekerfaq.html advice], including "how to increase your [[piss|output]]." There's a [http://www.deeker.com/motw.html message] and [http://www.deeker.com/qotw.html quote] of the week for all your diaper motivation, and then there's the bigger sections as covered below.

===Stories===
http://www.deeker.com/stories.html

[[Diaperfag]]s are bad enough, but at least most of them have the [[oxymoron|decency]] to just stay in their own fucked-up communities and have it be just one fucked-up aspect of their [[Unrealistic expectations|possibly normal]] lives. Deeker, however, [http://www.deeker.com/deeker_stories.html writes stories] that dwarf the bible. His longest work, [http://www.deeker.com/Stories/fid/forever_in_diapers.html Forever in Diapers], is 4822kilobytes. By comparison, Our [[TL;DR]] page is 205kb. Yeah, that page we made impossibly long? He fucking multiplied it by 50.

===Articles===
Claimed to be the reason people visit Deeker's website, the [http://www.deeker.com/articles.html articles] page is perhaps the most insane part of an already [[Batshit insane|batshit]] place. Now, if [[EDiot|we]] were paid, we'd read and summarize every article here. <s>However, if the famous [http://www.deeker.com/Articles/girls_guide_to_deekerianism.html Girl's Guide to Deekerianism] (seen later in this article) is any guide,</s> [[404|404'd]] these articles have the potential to ruin either your well-being or faith in humankind. Avoid at all costs.

===Surveys===
Over the years, Deeker has made [http://www.deeker.com/surveys.html 10 different surveys]. Once again, for the sakes of time and sanity, we'll just look at one in depth. In this case, [http://www.deeker.com/deekersurvey40/sister/sister_survey_form.html the sister survey form], although [http://www.deeker.com/deekersurvey40/thong/thong_summary.html the survey just for girls who wear thongs around their diapered brothers] might be just as good.

The targeted age range is 6-21+, showing Deeker is totally [[not gay|not a pedo]]. On top of that, [http://www.deeker.com/deekersurvey40/sister/sister_summary.html 75%] of responders are minors, including two seven year olds. But just surveying minors isn't a big deal, is it? Not on its own, but when you throw in completely unrelated questions asking height, body type, and especially "How would you describe your butt size?" things get a little weirder. But these ten questions are enough about you, let's get on to the questions about that brother of yours. Deeker asks an hour's worth of questions about everything insane you can think of. "What do you like the most about changing your brothers' diapers?" notably features the possible answers of Getting to see them naked (14%), Seeing their erect penises (19%), and Arousing them sexually (13%). A later question asks what the girl finds most rewarding, featuring 25% of respondents choosing "it affords me sexual gratification". 28% of respondents said that sexual activities make their diaper changes last longer. May we remind you this is a survey for [[incest|sisters]] and 75% of those filling it out are underage? Does this ED article even have a purpose anymore? Is there a point to making fun of someone who has no dignity?

==Deeker and other creepy diaper fucks==
[[File:Hot_summer_day.jpg|thumb|This is completely innocent]]
It takes a special kind of crazy to be hated even by the people normal society shuns. [[Fail|Prominent diaper fetish website]] ADISC has publicly condemned Deeker, going so far as to include a [http://anonym.to/?http://www.adisc.org/wiki/index.php/Deeker page on their wiki] informing people to stay the fuck away. Their reasoning is that Deeker's site crosses the line between "healthy" fantasising about diapers and [[pedophilia]]. To further emphasise how serious they are about this issue, a [[fanfiction|dramatic story]] was written about Deeker and posted on the ADISC forums.

''Deeker. ''<br/>
''The Enemy.''<br/>
''It was left to one to stop them for good.'' <br/>
''And he was a Babyfur. A fox, to be exact. Diapers for justice, and ready to deliver a furry knuckle sandwich to the leader of Deeker, MFH, and bring revenge to the *B/DL/Fur community.''<br/>
''His name was Zack. And he was ready to kick some perverted ass.''

''Zack entered the building where the Deeker community held their nasty meetings, discussing “sightings” of little boys in diapers, and fapping over the pictures members gathered. Zack, being strong in his Babyfur cuteness, stepped into the room, and acted as cute as possible.''
 
''All members in the room turned around, some in the middle of their disgusting fapping, some covered in their own cum, and others filling out reports of their “Sightings”, where they most likely raped a boy in his diapers. Some of them even drooled just looking at the fox. ''

''Zack opened his arms, as if asking for a hug. The members looked at eachother, as if a miracle had just happened. A fur-covered, diaper wearing, miracle. They summoned their leader, who came upon them through a puff of white smoke. He was disgusting. A large man; fat and with a stubbly beard. He looked at the fur, and walked tword him, arms reaching out and hands grabbing, just ready to take the whole fur in. 
Zack let him come close, then he smirked and pulled out an M84 from behind him. None of the members saw it; as they were too distracted by his Babyfur-ness''
 
''MFH was shocked; Zack let fire. “Die, you pervert!” he shouted, as he fired multiple shots. MFH ran like hell away, but he was shot multiple times.''
 
''The members ran after Zack, trying to stop him; but Zack turned around and shot all of them, and killed them all.''

''MFH took this opportunity to run and call for [[cancer|/b/lackup]] ((That’s 4chan talk; it means calling in all from the /b/ board from 4chan—Katie)). ''

''Zack turned around and threw his M84 down; for he was out of bullets. He reached into his diaper, and pulled out…a few grenades! He took the ring out of the first one, and threw it at MFH, knowing his fatness would slow him down enough to give time to set the grenade to explode. ''

''It exploded, and blew up in MFH’s face, but it was still not enough. For he had the fapping power of his [[cancer|/b/rothers]] ((/b/rothers are the members of /b/--Katie)), powering him to a level of over 9000. Suddenly, the far left wall crashed down, and multiple 4channers flooded the room. ''

''Zack was tackled down by [[cancer|Pedobear, and Mudkip]] used its watergun on Zack, making him soaked, and causing him to wet himself. MFH stood above Zack, and looked down at him.''
''
“So what are you going to do next, little boy?”''

''Zack thought for a moment, and looked back up at MFH. “I’m going to get my revenge.” He said, and squeezed his eyes shut. ''

''“What the hell?” MFH backed away from him. ''

''Zack used his Incontinence Bomb, which caused a huge atomic explosion to blow up the place, killing everyone, including MFH.''

''The building was on fire, and in ruins. Zack emerged from the rubble, heavily wounded, and he looked up at the light shining down on him. ''

''“I need a change, Daddy.” He said, and walked on.''

''He was a Hero never to be forgotten.''

|The general consensus is that he is a pedophile - which is an explanation for why he features stories involving children. But, I personally believe that he is just very naive. Like, he got so lost in fantasy, it permanently warped his personality. He allowed this fetish to consume him, and skew reality of things. Older children wearing diapers in public are rare. Most often, for special needs, and treated very privately. His stories are pure fiction; cheap fap material. I think the largest area of concern, however, is that instead of stories of self-placement into situations of an infantile nature, he involves children, seemingly for a sense of sexual gratification.|Armchair psychologist gets it right for once?

|Yeah... The thing I find really distressing about Deeker's site is that he thinks it would be a good thing to never let young children (particularly boys) be toilet trained. That is just warped and twisted beyond belief. I think the alleged "sightings" are outright fabrications (at least I *hope* they are). I also find it disturbing that he implies it would be cool if young brothers and older sisters had quasi-incestuous relationships.

|I think the main issue, besides the general consensus here that he likely has some pedo tendencies, is the way that d-word's page (I will not say the actual name, it does not need repeating) portray's us in a negative light. This is quite unfortunate because for many people who may not understand what *B/DL is and choose to research it on the internet, they will likely stumble across d-word's page, likely before they find higher quality sites such as adisc.

Unfortunately for us and also for those who yearn to understand us better, first impressions are of the utmost importance as a first impression of anything has great influence on shaping peoples opinion on something. For example, someone driving from New York into New Jersey on the Jersey Turnpike for the first time will most likely have the impression that [[Truth|New Jersey is just a foul smelling, ugly, industrialized wasteland with way too much traffic]]. All that these people have seen is a very small part of the state, yet their impressions of the state as a whole is shaped by this. They fail to realize the natural beauty of the mountains, the shore and the pine barrens. (I mean absolutely no disrespect to New Jersey, I lived there, it's great, I'm just using it as an example.)

Our community is exactly the same way. The majority of us are warm, caring, compassionate, law abiding people. The majority of us are regular people, we come from all walks of life and you would not be able to pick us out from a crowd.

However, like just about any community, their are un-savory types. Those who cast a bad shadow over the rest of the community. Considering the nature of many of the posts and stories, many of them congregate at d-word's site and unfortunately, many outsider's opinions of our community as a whole are based on what they see there.

That, at least in my opinion, is why there is a bit of animosity about d-word's site, especially among the members of this site.|Ace

|Conversely, when a site (Deeker's) mixes infantilism (or anything) with references to childrens' sexuality ("did the boy have an erection?" and so on), it is complicit in at least poor taste and occasionally criminal behavior (molestation, kidnapping, abuses of power/status, abuse).|h3g3l
|Why do we hate deeker?

==The Deekerian Guide To Diapering==

Further to his shenanigans on Deeker.com, it seems that Mr. Crosby has created his own pseudo religion to go along with his harmless little hobby. The Girls' Guide to Deekerianism is a comprehensive set of guidelines in destroying a boys psyche and is on the Encyclopedia Dramatica recommended reading list.

'''Warning''': The original Deekerianism Girl's Guide, located [http://www.deeker.com/Articles/girls_guide_to_deekerianism.html here] states that it is intended for girls aged 8 upwards, so please do not allow your younger children to read it unsupervised.

===A "Brief" Introduction===

As we're sure you know, Deekerianism only applies to a select few boys and girls who wish to fully immerse themselves in the diaper lifestyle, but if you want to be part of his cult, then you have to follow some pretty specific guidelines in regards to your diapertime.

{{squote|Please also feel free to share this information with your parents as you will need their help to supply you with the necessary resources for providing your brother with the Deekerian Diaper Boy Experience.|Encouraging children to tell their parents about this is a bold move, let's see how it works out}}

===Getting Started===

Things to bear in mind:

*If you choose cloth diapers over disposables, there is no limit to how many you can use on your boything. Bear in mind that disposable diapers are frowned upon in Deekerianism. Little Swimmers and Goodnites are also discouraged, as they do not project the right image and are unsuitable for bowel movements, as found in the site's [[sick fuck|Diaper Ratings]] section.
*[[plastic crap|Plastic pants]] are a sexy and hygienic accessory for cloth diapers.
*White is the best colour, as Deeker himself says:"When you see your brother bending over to take a big dump in his diapers, there is no mistaking all that thick white fabric on his butt". Colours and patterns detract from the basic appeal of a diaper, and are another thing to be avoided.
*If you do choose disposable diapers, you should poke holes in them to maximise the experience.
*Use lots of clear tape to wrap him up whilst in his diapers, just for fun.

===Big, Thick, High-Rising and Multiple!===

The most important thing about a good set of diapers is that they be big, thick, high-rising, and multiple. This maximises noticability and awareness, and also makes changing the diaper a more involved experience that you can savour for longer. Pants are also impossible to wear when multiple diapers are in play, need we say more except that you can then sit in the excited wonder of not knowing whether his diaper is clean or not because the thickness minimizes unsightly leakages? Deeker also encourages, if you have more than one boy in diapers, making contests to see who can go the longest without having one changed. First one to call child abuse loses. According to the guide, the wearing of trousers and shorts should be completely prohibited too, and the boything's old pants worn by girls or destroyed. This is to ensure that he is constantly reminded of his diapering and that the smells he creates are allowed to float freely around, rather than being trapped underneath clothes.

===Disadvantages===

Other than the obvious accusations of [[sick fuck]]ery from close minded people who do not understand the beauty of a young, half naked boy sitting in his own shit, there are a few disadvantages to using big thick cloth diapers over disposables, but the main one is that they will hide even the most pronounced erection, which is a big shame because that is all part of the joys of the hobby. Storage and cost is also a possible issue, but if you are poor and live in a small house then fuck you, you don't deserve to be in the gang.

===The Place of Pants and Other Non-Diaper Attire===

{{squote|In a perfect Deekerian world, a diaper boy would never wear pants. In fact, he would never even own a pair of pants. Everywhere he went— school, church, the mall, the airport, doctor appointments, the supermarket, even formal events such as weddings and funerals— he would be in his diapers only. Weather would not be a factor, and if it was too cold he’d have to remain indoors. Such is the life of a diaper boy.|Such is the life}}

Dan Crosby hates pants. According to him you should:

*Lock your boything's pants away and keep the key on you at all times. You should wear tight jeans and seductively place the key in your pocket though, so he is further reminded of his diapers.
*Give him worn, dirty second-hand pants. This will ensure he realises they are not to be revered, unlike Deeker and Deekerianism. Pants are for society, and should not be enjoyed.
*Diapers should always be visible when wearing pants, the delightful bulges must always be on show.
*Whenever there is not need for him to be in pants, he should be in diapers only. Deeker cannot stress enough how important the no-pants rule is, he really can't.
*Pyjamas are not allowed, either. Socks are encouraged as long as they come to just under the knee and are stripy. We suspect this is for [[transvestite|personal]] rather than [[logic|practical]] reasons.

There are many other rules regarding other clothes but they are unfunny and not worth mentioning.

===They Don't Make 'Em Like They Used To===

Fortunately, regular tighty whiteys can be used as diapers! As long as they are [[boring|plain white]] and [[old|high rising]], the trick is to layer them. [[at least 100|Up to forty]] pairs can be worn at any one time, for maximum soaking. Alas, it is not all good news, ED, for they do not make them like they used to. The seat is not [[double nigger|double lined nowadays]], nor does the waistband ride quite as high [[in the ass|up your boything's back]]. They are available in colours other than white now, some even with [[OMG|patterns]]. They are just not [[crap|the same]], and this is [[emo|sad]] because their [[evolution]] has brought them further and further away from being [[retarded|diaperlike]]. So incredibly sad.

{{squote|
Deviating even further away from the diaper-esque appearance of the original boys’ white briefs are the ones which do not even have a fly front and are cut very low. These usually come in exotic colors and designs, too, which, combined with the other missing features of the original style of boys’ underwear, makes them too much like Girls’ panties. In no way are these types of boys’ underpants suitable to serve as diapers. The greatest [[sparta|blasphemy]] of all against the original design of boys’ underwear is the current trend with boxer shorts!|There are too many beautiful quotes on this site}}

===Adding Fuel to The Fire===

You may want to add [[drugs|diuretics and laxatives]] to your boything's diet as a healthy supplement to further enjoy the diaper experience, and a "[[sexist|Girls Only]]" sign on the bathroom door will further enforce the idea that shitting yourself is a good thing. Repeat it with us now, shitting yourself is a good thing. Further additions you can make to the diaper lifestyle include, but are not limited to; Diaper related nicknames, allowing your friends to change your boything's diapers, flaunting your diaperlessness with low slung jeans and skimpy undies, making him go outside in his diapers (you should probably make him wear [[Larathen|those cute socks]] too), and the creation of [[shitty art|diaper art]].

===Sexy Diapers===

Of course diapers, particularly ones that have been shat in, are very sexy. The thought of partying down in a squelchy mix of your own excrement is no doubt a mysterious and seductive prospect to you. It gets better though: according to [[pedophile|Deekerianism]], masturbation is to be encouraged in boys who are as yet, [[cp|too young to ejaculate]]. It will not only allow you to experience the joy of being [[Micheal Jackson|an actual pedophile]], but it will also ensure that all of their [[virginity|sexual energy]] for the rest of their lives is focused on [[dying alone|diapers]], rather than [[irl|real life]] people. A totally healthy and not at all psychologically damaging result, I'm sure you'll agree. Masturbation should, of course, only be done whilst wearing diapers in order to maximize diaper related [[sick fuck]]ery. Tell the world, diaper lovers!

===Miscellany===

{{squote| Kids at a public school would tease him mercilessly and his social development would suffer. By home-schooling him, he won’t be exposed to other kids, and most of all, he won’t have to ever get dressed to go to school. His diapers will be the required dress code. |Yes, you read correctly| his social retardation will be prevented by diapers and home schooling.}}

The Sick Fuck's Guide to Diaper Related Sick Fuckery is a whirlwind tour of the art of diapering. Every sentence is filled with quotes waiting to be recorded, perversions waiting to be laughed at and a pedophile who wants to live in a world where he can keep little boys locked up, away from the real world without access to toilet facilities, stewing in their own fecal matter waiting to be [[partyvan|v&]].

Dan Crosby states that Deekerianism is not a cult, whilst making it extremely clear that it is absolutely a cult. His words should be followed as gospel, and the kicker is that he thinks preteen girls should be reading them. In short, the man is a fucking genius, and his guide will change the world.

A seventh grade kid with lots of undies on<br />
Then one day I saw him in the nude<br />
All the poop on his butt was a sight rather crude

Crap that is, brown turds, smelly shit.

Well, the next you know he's wearing underwear<br />
Put on a bunch of pairs while everyone else stared<br />
Said, "These are my diapers, wouldn't you like to see?"<br />
So he loaded up his butt and then pooped so casually.

Stools that is, excrement, Lincoln logs. <br />

Diaper me tender,<br /> 
diaper me sweet, <br />
never let me wear pants.<br /> 
Diapers have made my life complete, <br />
and I love them so. <br />

Diaper me tender, <br />
diaper me true, <br />
all my diapers get filled. <br />
Oh my Diapers I love them, <br />
and I always will. <br />

Diaper me tender, <br />
diaper me thick, <br />
in them I don't just fart. <br />
Extra padding does the trick, <br />
and they warm my heart. <br />

Diaper me tender, <br />
diaper my rear, <br />
please powder my behind. <br />
I don't want diaper rash for years, <br />
not even till bed time. <br />

(When at last my dreams come true <br />
Wearing diapers this I know <br />
People will point and laugh at me <br />
Everywhere I go).
|[http://www.deeker.com/Articles/lyrics.html#diaper_me_tender Diaper Me Tender]|Rising up-- high up my back <br />
In my diapers, took a big dump <br />
Screwed toilet training and I took off my pants <br />
Just a boy and his will to defy <br />

So many times, it happens to boys, <br />
You trade your pants in for diapers, <br />
Don't lose your right to keep diapers on your ass <br />
Keep them pinned tight to keep them up high <br />

It's the height of my diapers <br />
It's how they're pinned up so tight <br />
Rising up high to cover up my navel <br />
And my thong-clad big sister <br />
Sneaks behind me each night and she's staring and laughing <br />
At the height of my diapers <br />

Butt to back, white as a sheet <br />
Pinned up tight, staying up high <br />
She stacks the layers and she pads up my seat <br />
My sister has the skills to diaper <br />

(* REPEAT) 

Rising up-- high up my back <br />
On my butt, that's my story <br />
Screwed toilet training and I'm not going back <br />
Just a boy and his will to defy <br />

(* REPEAT)

Let the diapers hit the floor? srsly?|IMT
|Right here in my room<br />
Like thick Fruit of the Looms<br />
I get my butt back into my diapers<br />
You don't need good sight<br />
To see they're white<br />
I'm not a good butt wiper<br />

Don't lie<br />
Don't act so shy<br />
It's only teenage diapers<br />

Sally takes my hand<br />
To change my diapers and<br />
Pull them up higher<br />
She's a good diaper folder<br />
As she pads up my rear<br />
I see myself in the mirror<br />
Diapers pinned together<br />
No pants on I feel colder<br />

Teenage diapers<br />
They're only teenage diapers<br />
Teenage diapers<br />
Oh, oh,<br />
Teenage diapers<br />
They're all diapers!|[http://www.deeker.com/Articles/lyrics.html#teenage_diapers Teenage Diapers]

Phew, I'm a stinky one, a stinky one<br />

Ooh, please come and smell my bum, come smell my bum<br />

==Is it a troll?==
That is an emphatic No. While we often start to think that something this fucked up must just be [[for the lulz]], one must realize that, as SA says, for every page you view there's 50 ZIP files you didn't. He currently has 137 galleries of 20 images each as well as 15 War and Peaces worth of stories. If it was a troll, he'd be trolling himself. This man is mentally demolished, [[BLACK_MAN|he will not recover]].

Since this article was [[Main Page|front paged]] in late April, [http://deeker.com deeker.com] has been [[404]]'d. Readers should note this was not the intended effect but merely a byproduct of [[win]]. At least twice however Deeker.com has risen from the grave in one last desperate attempt to cling on to life while his diaper-wearing shit-squelching fans all breathed a collecive sigh of relief and simulteneously wet themselves. But alas, the respite was short-lived. And people say that [[ED]] doesn't make the internet a better place...


===Deeker: The (Temporaroy) Rebirth===
On July 9th, Deeker posted a notice on his page to let people know that he has a [http://www.hobbes.tv/ new site] run by his [[lolcat|cat]].

{{squote|There came a time in May where [[Dan]] got really mean and ugly. People were saying some bad things about him, and I knew them to be lies. He would never do anything bad. But, he was slamming doors and kicking car tires and finally he couldn't sleep and I heard a LOT of bad words about a web page. I had no idea what a web page was, but I knew that he was really pissed off about it.  At the end of one [[quality|screaming scream]] he said that he was going to close it down and [[obvious|he did]].

Something that I have learned from living with Deeker is how to read and write. I learned how to use Dan's computer and I've gotten Dan's web page turned on. He didn't want me to use Deeker.com any more because of [[scroll up|all of the bad words that were said about it]]. So, it was decided that I would use my name - [[furry|Hobbes.]]}}

== The real reason Deeker.com went tits up ==

The Salt Lake Tribune

Updated: 05/16/2009 09:46:36 PM MDT

A sex offender known as "diaper boy" has been arrested in White City after he again showed a diaper he was wearing to children, police said.

Despite a long history of showing the diaper to children, recent attempts to charge him criminally have been frustrated because he does not expose his genitals.

More..The 31-year-old man was arrested Thursday after he showed his diaper and passed out pictures of adults and children wearing diapers from a Web site, said Salt Lake County sheriff's spokesman Don Hutson. Though the site is not pornographic, some of the shots are provocative, Hutson said.

The man has been arrested and booked about five times in locations around the Salt Lake City area, Hutson said. Court records show he was charged in 2008 with 11 counts of misdemeanor lewdness involving a child in Holladay, but those charges were later dismissed. He did register as a sex offender after pleading guilty to similar charges in 1999 and 2000, however.

He is now being held at the Salt Lake County jail, and possible new charges will be screened by the Salt Lake County Attorney's Office, Hutson said.
