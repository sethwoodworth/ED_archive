Pop music
{{spoiler|POP MUSICIANS DON'T WRITE ANYTHING THEY ARE FAMOUS FOR!}}

<center>'''Pop in a nutshell'''</center><center><youtube>u_gYaJXWeLo</youtube></center>

'''Pop music''', short for '''P'''ointless '''O'''verly-repetitive '''P'''asted Music [[Some argue|is characterized as the worst music ever created]].  While contemporary, it without fail [[Mtv|entertains the retards]] of its accompanying generation and is relentlessly made fun of by every generation before and after.  Pop music, by definition, is music that will not stand the test of time, but will make the radios [[Money|top 40 charts]].  It is a prime example as to why listening to the radio is akin to eating off of a [[faggots]] asshole [[Paraplegic|without using your hands]].
In general, pop music is made mostly for people with [[Retard|small minds]] that will listen to whatever they're told to listen to (whatever shitty garbage is thrown onto the radio thousands of times so that people know [[Asshole|who's cool]]).

== Origins ==

Pop musics origins are obviously when music was first invented, [[retard]].  [[Captain Obvious|Whenever any music is first written it is considered Pop music]].  Some might say that pop music began with  Beatlesmania before [[you]] were born.  This is complete and utter bullshit. Beatlesmania was, in fact, really an attempt to rip off a pop music craze of a larger scale [[at least 100 years ago]]: Mozartmania.  Mozartmania was such a radical success, [[The Beatles|some insignificant faggots in BRI'IN]] not only stole the name, but tried to recreate it's popularity.  However hard they may have tried, their competition was [[Batman|mother fucking Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], the [[Brokencyde|greatest rock star of all time]].  Therefore, it came as no surprise to the world when Paul McCarthy and John Feminine got their asses handed to them by his sheer memory. Now imagine what would have happened to the [[losers]] if they had tried that shit while the father of Rock 'n' Roll was still alive. Your guess is as good as ours, but it sure [[Butthurt|wouldn't have been pretty]].

Some more thoughts to fire off into that skull of yours.
What came first, the music or the misery? People worry about kids playing with guns, or watching violent videos? That some sort of culture of violence will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands, literally thousands of songs about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery and loss. Did you listen to pop music because you are miserable? Or are you miserable because you listened to pop music?

== Production ==

Pop music is created when a record label finds a band who is <s>sexually appealing</s> [[Lie|musically talented]] and decides to endorse their <s>image</s> music.  Said band of retards usually miss out on years of school and grow up to be ignorant fucking [[aspies]] who are expected to write songs with messages and meaning.  No wonder so many songs are about black culture, [[Traps|Women]], and the equivalent of [[BAWWW|crying]] into a microphone with a [[church]] choir in the background.  However [[Radiohead|shit]] the music is, the record labels tell the band that what they are writing is actually [[BrokeNCYDE|good]].
Said shit music gets handed to radio stations by the record labels, and within a matter of weeks every [[loli|person of impressionable age]] thinks it's like the fucking bible of it's genre.  [[Lie|Only bad musicians are left underground or start their own record label]].

[[Fact|All POP music is complete shit.  If it's listened to ten years later it's still shit.]]  If it's listened to 100 years later it's [[AWWRIGHT|okay]]! ...[[Not|possibly]].

== Lyrics ==
Due to record companies judging musical talent on a scale that favors good looks and retardation, most pop musicians are incapable of writing anything that remotely resembles the [[shit|music]] they are known for.  The industry, in a [[epic fail|desperate effort to look competent]], hires people who aren't capable of having good looks or being retards but can write songs.  While this seems like a good idea, the surprisingly literate professionals the record companies hire usually get a sense of self entitlement and lulz which in turn makes them want to write shitty music and fuck over the famous retards.  Therefore it is a good idea from the perspective of [[Nobody|anyone with an IQ higher than an aspie]].  The downside of such epic [[trolling]] is virtually every Top 40 song revolving around getting wasted and being a [[Lindsay Lohan|giant skankasaurous]].  Most songs consist of wave after wave of sexual innuendos and [[picture unrelated|metaphors that don't actually make any sense]] but that the artists will vehemently defend of being [[bullshit|"so deep"]] (because [[Sarcasm|they wrote it]], so they know what it means [[amiright]]?)

If a pop artist doesn't have anymore lyrics left but still have 2 minutes left in a song, they will either

* LA LA LA LA LA NA NA NA NA until fade
* Repeat the chorus
* Utilizing the [[pussy|lips]] for Beatboxing
* Add another guest artist to rape the song further
* Drum solo! (in rock)
* ????????
* PROFIT!!!

== Types of Pop Music ==
*[[Techno|Electronica]] - If Pop Music were to mean "popular music" ([[some argue|as retards so often like to argue]]) this would not qualify.  While Electronifags can't play any actual instruments, [[Shit nobody cares about|they tend to demonstrate a greater knowledge of how their abominable creations sound to the listener,]] therefore making [[Fact|8 bit music the greatest music being written today]]. The only good techno music is the [[Mortal Kombat]] theme. 

*[[Fat Larry's Band|Boybands]] - DON'T LIE TO ME. YOU ALL LISTEN TO THIS. YOU ALL KNOW THE NAMES OF THE MEMBERS OF COLOR ME BADD. Presumed dead in 2003 after the Backstreet Boys and Westlife admitted gayness, the cancer now infects Asia. This is what your sisters listen to as they shlick to [[Redneck|Nick Carter]]. Even [[Mexico|beaners]] have boybands, like No Mercy. Like BSB, they are also gay for each other.

*[[Rap|(C)rap]] - Every person who has ever written, listened to, enjoyed, or tried to associate with this complete lack of music is more [[Retarded|fucked up in the head]] than [[Gothzilla]].  In fact, most people don't even like rap, they think the people who write it are [[pretty cool guy]]s and try to be like them.  The problem here is that most rap artists are [[Camwhores|attention whores]] who grew up on [[Poor|welfare]] so they think they are better than everyone who was born rich.  This renders anyone who tries to imitate such a butthurt loser as [[unwarranted self importance|full of themselves]], [[internet tough guy|wannabe tough]] and [[cripple|rather funny looking]]. 'Rap' songs nowadays consist of 80% crunk, 20% [[Soulja Boy|YOOOOOOOUUU]] and choral singing, and there is no rapping. The unholy spawn of cock rock and rap crap, Rap Metal, is a troll genre for both Rock and Rap fans. It is a known fact that [[Eminem|Whiteys can't rap]],  [[Flea Market Montgomery|and all black people can rap]]. 
 
*[[Fake|Pseudo]]-[[Rock]] - Copypasta lyrics about the good old days and [[Alcoholism|pounding beer]] backed by anything off of the blues scale and the obnoxious gruff voice that tries ever so hard, yet fails every time, to imitate Layne Staley or [[an hero|Kurt Cobain]].  All of these things make pseudo rock one of the least tolerable forms of pop music.  Fun fact: all Top 40 rock is sung by [[NASCAR]]-loving [[White people|trailer trash]].  It's a well known fact that Rock bands have been [[doing it wrong]] since [[at least 100 years ago]], thereby making Rock the last recorded form of music that was ever [[doing it right]]. See : [[Nickelback]].

*[[Fake|Pseudo]]-[[Hick|Country]] - Pseudo country is notably different from the also terrible regular country genre in that it has found a place on the radio.  Like every other genre (except rap) it's musician populace consists of people who love the creators of the genre, yet despite their rabid [[fanboy|fanboyism]] will always without [[fail]] be [[doing it wrong]].  Country lovers and Rap lovers are similar in both [[Idiots|IQ]] and musical taste, making the both of them the most [[retarded]] of all listeners.  [[Irony|Ironically]], all country lovers are has been or are current [[lynching|lynchers]] who would do anything in their power to rid the world of niggers.  So much for [[Scientology|uniting in retardation]], [[amiright|eh]]?

*[[Old|Disco]] 
<s>[[Extreme Advertising|NOBODY GAVE A FUCK ABOUT DISCO EVEN WHEN IT WAS ON THE RADIO.  SKIP THE FUCK OUT OF THIS.]]</s> [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOf0FsA0Fio You're an idiot.]

*[[Crunkcore]] - At some point in every hip hop star's career, they get a dangerous feeling that they are capable of writing good music themselves.  The record company executives warn them not to say such ridiculous things, but they are [[idiots]], therefore such reasoning is completely beyond them.  To nobodies surprise, the music turns out to be complete and utter [[shit]] and is labeled under the genre "crunkcore" where only the most inbred of rap listeners are interested in it.

*[[Indie|"Indie" Alt-Alternative]] - Of all the modern genres, Indie represents the [[Bipolar|polar]] opposite of Electronica in that the musicians have a vague idea of how to play an instrument, yet [[Ignorant|lack an iota of understanding]] of how utterly shitty it sounds when they play.  They are of the impression that having a lead singer stutter worse than [[Bono|that singer from Pearl Jam]] and playing muddy guitar makes them sound like [[Hookers and Blow|the bees knees]].  [[Some Argue|Most Indie]] tries to sound cheerful, while playing more like they snorted several lines of Xanax before picking up their instruments.  It is notable for, even to it's listeners, being [[Harry Potter|completely void of mood or tone.]]  This causes much confusion among it's [[Faggots|fanbase]] as nobody knows [[Lolwut|what the fuck]] is being sung or even what the tone of the song is supposed to be. Indie is especially appealing to [[hipsters]].

[[Image:Justin bieber1.jpg|thumb|<s>[[Justin Bieber|I wonder who killed it?]]</s> Shit was dead before he came along, he just [[raped]] and threw up in its mouth while it was already down.]]

*[[Truth|Most]] of them however, can just be boiled down to one video.

== Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous ==
Pop stars are known mainly for their awe inspiring drug use, awe inspiring [[Unlimited disposable income|frivolous spending]], and awe inspiring [[Super whore|ability to get pregnant on command]].  As the average life span of a pop star is only 9.6 years (after they make it big), they spend most of their [[an hero|soon to be over lives]] [[DJ KEEMSTAR|acting superior]] to everyone else, hiding the fact that they lip sync at live shows, and pretending to give two shits about charities and fund raisers.  In reality, [[Nobody cares|nobody gives two fucks]] about [[retards]], yet the [[sarcasm|genius]] mind of the pop musician thinks otherwise.

Every fan of any band or musician ever should realize, before [[Whining|bitching]] like a [[hippie]], that [[fact|if you have ever heard of a band, they are sell outs]].  Every retard who thinks they can play the guitar, drums, or sing, only does so for a small handful of reasons: so they can get a record deal, get paid stupid sums of cash, eat cheese and crackers off of any vagina that comes to see them live, and write music with no regard to quality (as there is no clause requiring it on their contract).
