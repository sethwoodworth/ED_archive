'''Fundamentalists''' ("fundies," "[[Ted_Haggard|fgts]]") are closeted homosexual hardcore believers of their religion, which they believe  is the only religion in the world that can accurately explain the truth about the history of the universe.  The average fundamentalist, whether [[Christian]], [[Muslim]], ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' [[fanboy]],  ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fanboy]], [[goth]] [[fangirl]], or [[furry]], spends most of his or her time on the Internet engaged in [[flame wars|intellectual debate]] with other fundamentalists or [[atheists]] over [[shit no one cares about|subjects]] such as whether [[Jesus]], [[Islam|Muhammad]], [http://www.petitiononline.com/12w33d/petition.html or maybe even] [[Insane Clown Posse]] wanted [[you|their followers]] to kill all the [[Jews]], [[Arabs]], [[fags]], [[etc]].  
True fundamentalists write [[slashfic]] based on favorite characters from their holy [[books]], and constantly perform [[Self injury|acts of kindness]] due to their [[Conservatism|beliefs]]. FundieMENTALists do not believe in [[science]] as they believe it is a trick of [[satan]] to mislead them. Fundies also do not waste their money on [[Drug|medicine]] and would rather [[Suicide|pray]] in order to cure their cancer. In [[Latin]], "fundament" means [[ass]], ergo, all fundamentalists enjoy [[buttsecks]].

There are fundamentalists in every religion:

==[[Christian|Christianity]]==

Note:  Christian fundamentalists are identifiable by their [[obese|large]], [[incest|incestuous]] families. The husbands refer to their wives as "Mrs. [their surname]".  Fundamentalist wives, assuming that they have not had their tongues cut out, usually refer to their husbands as "my [[Pwned|Master]].", and are seen as [[breeders|baby-machines]], as these crazy-ass fundies say that all birth control is wrong.

==Trolling fundamentlists==
*Tell them their religion is complete bullshit
*Tell them to experiment with other religions
*Ask their opinions on other religions
*Mention that their religion might not be true
*Ask them to [[troll]] other [[religion]], then show them how their [[religion]] is just the same as the [[troll]]ed one.
*Here's for [[epic lulz]]. Become friends with a fundamentalist. Find another fundamentalist (same beliefs do not count). Copy that person's name. Tell the fundy you became friends with about this person. After that, watch the [[lulz]] from the two morons.
*Start any conversation with them about anything, and watch them troll themselves
*Also, Poe's law states it is almost impossible to tell the difference between a fundie and a parody of a fundie.This makes it easy to pretend to be a fundie and troll the fuck out of everyone.

''Remember:'' you can't spell "Fundamentalist" without "amen", "fun", "fund", "a", "mental" or "a list".  Also, you can't be a fundamentalist if you're not [http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/medical/fundament an ass].
