Something about [[MMO]]s turns people young and old into complete psychopaths. They get way too far into it, to the point that they spend every waking hour playing, they [[Pink Poodle|don't eat]], they lose their job, have to [[basement dweller|move back into their parents' house]] and apply for welfare just to support their [[habit|subscription]]. They believe that they are enjoying playing the games, but in reality they are moody, irritable and discontent with their lives. Does this remind you of [[Alcoholics|anyone]]? Nonetheless, the '''MMORPG Freak Out''' is an epidemic which has spread further than any form of [[swine flu|pig AIDS]] ever will.

Late May 2009, a video was posted to a YouTube account belonging to a [[13 year old boy]] who's thought it would be lulz to capture his brother having a [[insane|temper]] tantrum. Said brother was mentally freaking out over the fact that his mother had canceled his ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' account, which we know is like depriving a [[pedo]] of his precious children. [[yes|But shoving a remote up your ass won't bring back that WoW account, will it?]]

[[Some argue]] that this is an obviously fake video and that the reaction is staged [[over 9000]] times, however fake or not, this video is a prime example of the standard reaction that you would get from a [[WoW]]fag had his account suddenly been [[baleeted|expired]]. Nevermind that any MMO-fag worth his experience points would know that one cannot 'cancel' a WoW account, one buys credits that run out. Most Gamestops, EBs, and their like carry WoW recharge cards, though some would also argue that the Mother simply stop paying for the credits, and the WoWfag didn't notice his points running out; Even if he did, the mother could have simply stopped giving the kid any [[jew gold|monies]], and considering the WoWfag likely has no IRL friends to panhandle from, he couldn't get a Recharge card, and was hoping his mother would give him credits in the nick of time to keep his account from expiring. [[E-Psychiatrist|Certain people]] have shown that [[you]] can actually become a [[WoW]] [http://www.wowdetox.com addict], you have been warned. 

Recently Wafflepwn changed the description of his channel, saying that Stephen just admitted he was gay. [[Fail|AS EXPECTED!]]

===The Culprit===

The original and best of the [[WTF|Silly]] Steven series.

{{quote|This is so goddamn fake, why do people keep posting this? It's not even that funny.|raging pathetifag}}

===The Aftermath===
This is what happened when [[Win|Wafflepwn]] showed his brother the above video. Note the denial of [[gay|gayness]].

===The Rest Of The Videos===

This is the rest of the terribly unfunny videos which augmented the size of the original poster of this series of videos after having his tiny [[Penis|ego]] massaged to gargantuan proportions by the sheep who frequent youtube.

===The Coverup===

<center>{{frame|<youtube>X-fCrjsUq30</youtube>|color=#9FE7E6}}</center>

This video would seem legit to anyone other than trained youtube video critics such as the entire userbase of [[ED]].

When Stephen forced ''Wafflepwn'' to remove the 6th video an asshole named '''waffflepwn''' (three 'f's opposed to two) took advantage of the situation. He downloaded and uploaded the video afterwards claiming that the real ''wafflepwn's'' parents removed the video and grounded him. He converted a hundreds of people away from Wafflepwn by stealing his loot. This made ''wafflepwn'' a very angry teenage nerd.

===MW2===

Despite getting massacred constantly, he continues to play. Watch this rager (who sounds exactly like Wafflepwn) frustrate himself in Modern Warfare 2.

===The Original Video===
This video was filmed 3 years before. Notice any [[plagiarism|similarities??]]. It is obvious to anyone with [[retard|half a brain]] that all of the videos are unoriginal ripoffs of an already old series of boring videos about nerds freaking out.

==The Interview==
On July 10th, 2009, Kidd Chris Radio Show managed to do an interview with Jake and Stephen's mum. She confirmed that all the videos were scripted, and Stephen was actually behind the whole thing.
