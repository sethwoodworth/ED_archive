''From [[Futhman]]'s new journal:''
:all right, so my pal Cstone alerted me to the Paris Hilton phone breakout thing (mirror on my site) before it hit any of your stupid websites and he three-wayed all these celebrities and I called them. I only got through to Eminem, since it had already been half an hour that the sites were posted, but here's a whole bunch of messages I left on celebrities' answering machines:

*[[Media:Anna_kournikova.ogg|Futhman calls Anna Kournikova.]]
*[[Media:Ashley_olsen.ogg|Futhman calls Ashley Olsen.]]
*[[Media:Eminem.ogg|Futhman calls Eminem.]]
*[[MEdia:Fiona-prankcall.ogg|Futhman calls Fiona Apple.]]
*[[MEdia:Lindsay_lohan.ogg|Futhman calls Lindsay Lohan.]]
*[[MEdia:Vin_deisel.ogg|Futhman calls Vin Deisel.]]
*[[MEdia:Postathread.ogg|I will post a thread now.]]
