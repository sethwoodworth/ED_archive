[[Zerg Rush]] is a type of attack in ''[[Starcraft]]'', a game by the company [[World of Warcraft|Blizzard]]. However it was perfected with the slanted eye power of [[AZN|AZNS]], specifically, the Koreans who are known to die in obsession with the game (see [[seppuku]] and [[faggot]]).  Pretty silly on its initial view, but it has extreme dramatic potential to piss off people and cause lulz..  

Zerglings, the little creatures which are easy to create but easy to kill, are a staple of the [[newbie]] set, and are incredibly difficult to deal with.

==Origins==
The origins of a "Zerg Rush" come from the fact that at the start of a ''Starcraft'' game, a zerg player has an advantage to quickly build cheap offensive units faster than any other race. This allows the player to amass Zerglings (the aforementioned cheap offensive unit) and eliminate a player before they even get a chance to finish building a defense. As more retarded n00b gamerz started playing games, they bastardized the word into many different meanings. As such, the meaning of a zerg rush continues to evolve way outside of Starcraft. 
For example, because in a zerg rush, the player tends to be greatly outnumbered, many people believe a zerg rush to mean build lots of units and attack with them. However, if the tactic is planned for late game, it removes from original rushing part of a zerg rush, because by this point the enemy should have suitable defense. Sadly, this definition of zerg rush seems to be the majority so it is accepted as a proper use of zerg rush.

An extension of the zerg rush is to apply it to other unit types in the game, such as "DT (Dark Templar) Rush" (Dark Templars being permanently cloaked and very powerful) or even in the context of [[Shit nobody cares about|other games]], "Grunt Rush", "Minigunner Rush", "Tank Rush", etc. In the true spirit of the original definition of a rush, this would mean to rush to the technological level of that particular unit and use the advantage of that unit to "out tech" the other player.

The use of the term "KEEKEKEEEKEEE!!!1" often accompanies zerg rushes as outlined above (but zerg rushes actually need to have a "Rush" component to it. Don't listen to him about the outnumbered shit, total bullshit), due to the charming and memorable noise the Zerglings make when striking an opponent.

==Implementing a Real Zerg Rush==

* In ''Starcraft'', create a game named "1v1 NO RUSH GOGO!"

* Make a bunch of zerglings.

* Take your army of zerglings and rush your opponent's camp before he/[[No girls on the internet|<s>she</s>]] has time to put up a valid defense.

* [[????]]

* [[PROFIT]]

==Using "Zerg Rush" in Other Games==
* Play any real-time strategy game such as ''Command & Conquer'' or ''[[Warcraft]]''.
* Build an ass load of low-level, cheap attack units, for example C&C red alert 2  (shurly ccrat?)  This  involves playing as a Soviet and building [[at least 100]] (preferably [[Over 9000]]) Rhino tanks and then keeping them moving round in circles in enemies base with un-reasonable over use of waypoint mode, 
* A (crap) version of this is known as the "allied air rape" involving 9 hot-keyed Aircraft carriers, to demolish y00r base.
* In Age of Empires 3 start as British, and make sure you have the Factory and Robber Baron cards, so you get 2 factories, and spam fuck with Musketeers and then Zerg Rush with your rockets and Gatling guns after you revolt.
* ps. remember to spam "C" so as all your doods cheer lots. 
*Company of Heroes start as American, them spam fuck riflemen, or play as British spam bren carriers then zerg rush with Churchills.(You motherfucking cunt)
* Type/yell "ZERG RUSH!!111  KEEKEKEKEKE!!" once you get to their base and start your attack.
** (This step is <s>optional</S> mandatory  and adds to the "authenticity" of a ZERG RUSH.)
* [[????]]
* [[Profit!|PROFIT!!]]

==Using "Zerg Rush" in Dramatic Situations==
[[Image:LurkerBelow Large.jpg|thumb|[[Lurker|Zerg Lurker]].]] 

* In a [[debate]], if someone throws a pile of links or [[fact]]s around, reply with "[[OMG]] ZERG RUSH!!![[oneoneone]]"

* A comment bomb-type situation (see: [[Ljpizza_party]]) could be considered an [[LJ]] Zerg Rush.

* The quite famous "fifty Hitler post" or nowadays a "fifty Stalin", "fifty Terri Schiavo", "fifty Natalie Holloway", "fifty anorexic" or "[[2000 Goatses]]" is an option for zerg rushing a forum when you don't have enough zerg handy.

*[[Assholes]] use this in ''[[Warcraft]]''.  It's a different [[fucking]] game you basement nerds.  Be creative you [[fucktards]].

*A horde of Kids leaving school grounds can also be considered a Zerg Rush

''"Omg zerg-rushed LM, lololol!!oneoneone11!  At least we have farm lulz!111@Queef!"''

==Words of Wisdom==

*If you can't solve a problem with Zerglings alone, build more Zerglings.
