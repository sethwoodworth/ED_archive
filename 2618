'''Electric Retard''' is a spectacularly mediocre [[webcomic]] written by self confessed pædophile ''Eric Vaughn''. It can be described as "existent" and "on the internet", however please do not confuse it with [[Goatse]], which satisfies both criteria however is a far superior piece. As with the majority of the [[sick fuck]] community, Eric finds it difficult to not include his [[pedophilia|hobbies]] in his [[bullshit|projects]], thus pedophilia is a recurring theme in his poorly drawn strips. Not the vaguely acceptable "she kinda looked old enough" type that [[truth|you know you would be susceptible to]], the kind where grown men rape babies.

Defender of all things holy [[John Solomon]] offended all 7 ''Electric Retard'' fans when he had this to say about their hero:

{{quote|...the pædophile who makes Electric Retard (and, yes, he literally is a pædophile) thrives off people complaining about his webcomic. [...] I have no intention of feeding that addiction as much as I have of sending him a 6-year-old girl...|Telling it how it is [http://badwebcomics.blogspot.com/2007/09/hookie-dookie-panic.html here]}}

If ''Electric Retard'' didn't provide you with enough wholesome imagery and inspire you to do totally legal things with that hot [[loli]] from down the street, the accompanying [[forums]] are a hot-spot for similarly [[unfunny|hilarious]] contributions to the good old fashioned [[lulz]]!.

Examples of material found on the old ''Electric Retard'' forums include:
*Hundreds of [[Shit|user-made]] fancomics drawn in [[MS Paint]] featuring a black person being shot or some white chick getting [[rape|raped]].
*[[4chan]]/[[Something Awful]] reposts.
*[[Old memes]].
*Grade A [[Faggotry]] in abundance.
*[[Nazi]] propaganda, and general meaningless [[racism]].
*[[Eric Bauman|Shameless self promotion]] via spamming [[b|other monstrosities]]


The ''Electric Retard'' forum is locked in a never ending quest to spawn catchy memes across every corner of the internet. These are the[[retard|OMG MILLHOUSE IS NOT A MEME IS A MEME LOL <3]] crowd and they have made such stunning attempts as:

*Mr. Brown, mascot of ''Electric Retard'', often called upon for a '''black person removal'''.
*[[Hitler|Giant Naked Hitler]]. OMG edgy.
*[[Scat|Shitman]]
*[[Retard|Rapeface]]
*[[Kanye West| George Bush Does Not Care About Black People]]
*The aformentioned Aryan Sun.

It is to be noted, as the new forum is up, we are now 100% sure that Eric is a [[faggot]].

===The Australia Connection===

Recently, Eric posted a picture of himself relaxing at home with a cigarette, watching some [[TV]] on a Brisbane forum.

===Something Awful. Something Really, Really Awful===
----

Early in the morning of October 28, 2009, Eric Vaughn posted a ban'''me''' thread on Something Awful.  In the OP, Eric detailed himself "cleaning" his keyboard, and provided the following images

Image:ERban1.jpg|Dude, that's a dirty keyboard.
Image:ERban2.jpg|Yeah, really dirty.
Image:ERban3.jpg|OK, you've kind of made your point.
Image:ERban4.jpg|Wow, look at it there on the paper. That's really good Eric, thanks.
Image:ERban5.jpg|Ooh, a bit more.
Image:ERban6.jpg|Glad to see you cleaning it up.
Image:ERban7.jpg|Right. Tedium is setting in.
Image:ERban8.jpg|Oh why hello there little fella. What are you doing here?
Image:ERban9.jpg|Not really into that but ok.
Image:ERban10.jpg|Eric what are you doing?
Image:ERban11.jpg|Oh God.

Stunning performance there from Mr. Vaughn.

== Critical reception ==

Unsurprisingly, [[conservative]] [[Christian]] [[Your Mom|mothers]] were appalled when they caught their [[13 year old boys|sons]] fapping to the sight of an elderly lady being split apart by the phallus of a giant Hitler and flooded ''Electric Retard's'' hosting provider with complaints. After "''careful consideration''", the website was pulled due to a TOS technicality.

Expand the gallery for Eric's raw, unyielding, post-dystopian visual polemic of societal woes.
'''Warning:''' It will make you think, and Mr. Vaughn makes no apologies for that.
