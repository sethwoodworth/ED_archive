'''Memesheep''' are individuals whose entire [[Internets]] experience revolves around forwarding [[meme|memes]] to their supposed [[friends]] and posting the results of various [[Quizilla]] and [[OKCupid]] tests to their [[LiveJournal]] or [[Weblog | blog]]. Like the actual [[animal]], the [[sheep]], "memesheep" is used both in singular ("She is a memesheep") and plural ("You guys are all such memesheep") forms.

Most memesheep are [[16 year old girls | sixteen year old]] [[fangirl]]s and unimaginative [[Attention Whore | attention whores]], who use memes and [[quiz]]zes as a way to reaffirm their [[e-dentity]]. An individual memesheep will post the results of a quiz, for example, if that quiz result describes her as a "dark angel" who is physically "beautiful" but harboring a "deep and mysterious soul" (or something to that affect). Such a result serves to inform people of the poster's "coolness," since he or she given a (supposedly) insightful answer by an otherwise "impartial" quiz. Few ever dare mention that the posted result was only arrived at after a dozen attempts, or that the memesheep in question answered the questions in such a way as to reach the desired outcome.
