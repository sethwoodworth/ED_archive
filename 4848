''This page is about the word. If you were looking for Mr. Baxter, click [[In Joke|here]].''

The word '''like''' used to be traditionally used as a adjective, noun, verb, or conjunction, but nowadays the word is strictly used as an adverb or quotative.  This is because over the past two decades [[teenager]]s have turned this into their favorite word.  High school and college students nowadays are so brain-damaged by [[MTV]], that they absolutely ''cannot'' say a single sentence without the insertion of at least three uses of the word ''like''.  In fact it is overused by teenagers in speaking just as often as they overuse [[commas]] in their writing.

Like can be best described as, like, [[All_caps|THE MOST ANNOYING WORD IN THE FUCKING ENGLISH LANGUAGE]].

When the fact that the English language is quickly approaching the [[Over_9,000|1,000,000]] word mark is considered, a question arises: [[Rage|CAN'T TEENAGERS THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY INSTEAD OF LIKE ALL THE GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING TIME???????????????]] The answer is obviously no, seeing as today's generation, known as generation-Y (moar liek generation WHY, amirite?), is so fucking possessed by mainstream media and so ridiculously fucking stupid, that a majority of them have vocabularies limited to under [[9,000]] words. The aforementioned brainwashing happened [[last Thursday]] when [[MTV]] first aired. [[Fail|America]]'s progress in spinning down the shitter was exponentially accelerated ever since.

== Example ==
"[[tl;dr]] Like, today, I, like, went to the mall to, like, go shopping, and, like, saw some, like, totally [[awesome]] shoes, but they were, like, soooo expensive. But then, like, I got a call on my cell, and, like, it was my boyfriend, and he was like, "Hey, what's going on?" and I was like, "Not much, but I need, like, some more [[money]]" and you know what he said?  He was like "SURE!" I was, like, so excited! Like, [[oh my God]]! So he, like, came to the mall and, like, hugged me and, like, got the credit card out and, like, used it to, like, buy the shoes, but the card was, like, maxed out, and I was, like, soooooo embarrassed! And, like, I was standing there, like, crying like a baby, like, you know, like, like... You know, like, like, like, '''like''', '''like...''' '''like...''' '''like...''' '''like...''' <big><big>like</big></big><big><big><big>like</big></big></big><big><big><big><big>like</big></big></big></big><big><big><big><big><big>like</big></big></big></big></big><big><big><big><big><big><big>like</big></big></big></big></big></big>

==[[image:fblike.png]] Facebook==
On the popular social networking site, [[Facebook]], there is a like button underneath pretty much everything on the site, allowing you to show that you [[liek]] something (Obv). Some say that you can get the dislike button right now if you join this group, but usually it is just a browser plug-in that steals your credit card information and sends it to [[Nigeria]].

==Using "like" to its fullest potential==
