COMBO BREAKER
{{Notice|'''[[The Chemo That Is Curing /b/|Chemo'd]] meme is [[The Chemo That Is Curing /b/|chemo'd]].'''}}


Just an irritating meme that is used to break the stupidity when a certain thing goes on for too long. It is stupid in its very nature, so it really adds to the stupidity in an irritating fashion.

'''''Was''''' used a lot on [[/b/]] (pre-[[The Chemo That Is Curing /b/|chemo]]) on threads with posts that repeat the same thing over and over.

== Usage ==
[[Image:Combowhore.jpg|thumb|right]]
When using, you almost always say it as C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!
Add extra C's if you're a [[cumdumpster]].

'''NOTE:''' Usage of combo breakers tends to lead to [[anti-lulz]]. Proceed at your own risk.

== Example ==
DESU
DESU
DESU
DESU
DESU
[[DESU]]
DESU
DESU
DESU
C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!
DESU
DESU
DESU

(Additional note: the combo breakers have a tendency to contribute absolutely nothing so are generally ignored entirely so using them is pretty much a waste of your time.)

== How NOT to Break Combos ==
Do '''not''' combo your combo breakers. This creates a [[divide by zero|time paradox]] leading to an alternate dimension where you are not a fag. Examples of this include posting "C-C-C-C-COMBO" and "BREAKER" in different posts, and using half of an image containing the "COMBO BREAKER" macro. Also, smashing the keyboard does not equal a combo breaker. A combo can only be broken with a combo breaker. Also do not EVER use "COMBO BREAKER" after only a single phrase. You will look like the ultimate [[shit|shit-head]].  Finally, if you have already disobeyed the first rule and combo'd your combo breakers, DO NOT break this combo or we're all fucked.

==The only way to break a combo break is to combo break your own breaker==

It is a well known fact that computers cheat like fuck, some call it a glitch, but we all know they secretly come alive at certain times to show your meatsack faggot ass who runs shit. Below is a video example of such an event. Furfaggot Sabrewulf tries to throw his batshit doogitz at Cinder and gets his ass handed to him, Cinder breaks his own combo as an extra fuck you.

== Origins ==
Originates from ''Killer Instinct'', created by Rare, you know, the people who made ''Donkey Kong Country'' with all the [[furries|fucking animals]].

Bringing the [[internets]] to even greater levels of time wasting [[fapping|potential]] and proving that [[Truth|99.99% of the images on Google are porn]], www.c-c-c-combobreaker.com/ lives up to the [[retarded|shitty]] meme it steals its name from. When [[raped|refreshed]], it fetches a new random image from the deep, seedy underbelly of [[furfaggotry|society]] that is Google Images. Seriously, it's all [[pr0n|porn]].
