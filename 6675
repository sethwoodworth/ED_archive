Psytrance [also know as the music of the space monkeys] is a form of music enjoyed by [[autistic]] [[white]] people with [[hippy|dreadlocks]]. Much like leprosy, enthusiasts ruin everything they touch, but are thankfully easy to spot. Sounds like [[shit]], even on [[drugs]].

Way back... [http://perso.orange.fr/psychedelic_trance/psy_history_part1.htm long, long, long ago..] [[God]] said, "Let there be Psytrance" and when Simon Posford saw the light, he stood up, pulled down his pants and released a large [[epic]] [[crap]] on his brand new shiny Roland TB-303 and thus was Goa PsyTrance born. And it was [[good]]. Sometimes. Well, Occasionally.

Psytrance was created by [[white]] [[hippies]] who visted, and then subsequently decided to take over, Goa [[India]] in an effort to obtain [[lulz]]. The [[virus]] carrying Wookies enjoyed lots of psychedelics - especially [[LSD]] (before the great lsd bust of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Leonard_Pickard 2000]) and talking to "[[Aliens]]" (who turned out to be [[pedophiles]]) then created an entire sub-culture of an annoyingly similar-to-[[shit]] form of [[techno]] music. 

Over time "Goa Trance" evolved into 39812934158 sub-genres including, but not limited to: Psytrance, Prog trance, minimal, trauma, [[France]], neuro, Suomi, Aussie, Forest,Unicorn, scary, evil, morning, shit, fluffy, banging, The Hammer, Israeli, Cult of Gil and most pathetically, something called 'Psydub.' Most of it is unoriginal and spawns a lot of [[lulz]]; however, when high on [[drugs]], people seem to [http://youtube.com/watch?v=69VW4uFyPMM dance] to it. And if the [[drugs]] are not cut with [[shit]] may even reach the ultimate zen of a [[Unicorn Orgy]].

One day after the auditory [[almost rape]] became too much, a group of people went on a small acid trip and joined forces and created a [[cult]] named [http://chickenhed.us/ Chickenhed] as a way to counter the banality of the "scene" (although they quickly became everything which they had originally joined together to oppose). Around the same time, some [[terrorists]] got together and started a [http://forum.isratrance.com/ forum] to talk about all things relevant to [[fat]] [[13-year-old boys]].

===Artists===

The most popular songs and artists all involve drug use and/or aliens.

The best name is of course [http://www.discogs.com/artist/Logic+Bomb Logic Bomb], for it is most representative of their listening base. 

There are also collaborations between [[Paris Hilton]] and Infected Mushroom as well as projects involving Shpongle and the formerly-of-[[Phish]] cocaine addict Trey Anastasio. Neither project is worth finding on [[MySpace]]. 

The new album out by [http://www.discogs.com/artist/Younger+Brother Younger Brother] would have been better if [http://www.discogs.com/artist/Cure,+The Robert Smith of The Cure] sang on it. The vocalist they got sucks and [[ruined]] the entire album.

===Regional Differences===
[[Image:Xlr8r.jpg|thumb|nothing refuels a hard night of poking fire like Sparks(tm)]]
As with [[television]], Psytrance from different regions [[paint]] [[16 year old girls]] differently. In the Northwest region of the [[USA]] (specifically Oregon), they burn [[babies]] in fires called XLR8R's. In [[Sweden]], they get mad [[erection]]s while listening to the same [[faggotry]] drum beat over and over. In [[Israel]], they commit [[jihad]] on anyone who talks [[shizzle]] about that [[dickhead]] Erez. 
There are a lot of likenessesses between the regions though. Each region thinks theirs has the most [[superior]] form of [[acid]] dance [[music]]. Unfortunately, there has been no kind of Rocky Balboa championship boxing contest to determine a real [[winner]]. Like [[your mom]], this winner-takes-all contest to decide who reigns GODLY is simply frontin' on my [[dick]]!

===Future Ramifications===
In a century from now, long after the world ends on 2012 from a [http://tribes.tribe.net/nwcampfirezwar camp fire holocaust], PsyTrance will be remembered as music those kids-who-listen-to-too-much-[[Pacman]]-sounds-while-thinking-DMT-will-bring-them-enlightenment jammed out to all night long. Too bad some never got the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-XXu6xiyw memo].

===Psytrance Archetypes===
Like many scenes, there are archetypes that sub-divide a sub-divided group even more.  It is important, however, that these groups are labeled so we can judge people at parties without talking to them and in many cases even seeing, hearing, or smelling them. Thankfully, the good folks and contributors at [http://www.tranceamericana.org/brainmachines/trancespotting.html TranceAmericana](defunct) have done this for us already. These accurate descriptions of Psytrance party attendees include, not only the artist, dj/drug dealer, and vj, but more important archetypes such as the cokehead, drug nerd, psysnob, naked guy, jaded promoter, russian israelis, [[DJ]] groupies, fake indians, and many many more.
