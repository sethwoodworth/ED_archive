Translation
{{work|Internet lulz with online translation/translators}}
From the verb 'to translate', '''translation''' usually means to turn from one language into another (or from a foreign language into one's own). 

There are many helpful foreign language translation sites such as [[Babelfish]] on the Internets; however, most are completely useless and/or inadequate.

For example, using an online translator to translate the above into Portuguese, from Portuguese into French, from French to Greek and then translate the resulting [[copypasta]] back into English, one gets the following:

'''''The verb "s detraduire, the translation means generally you turn a language in other (or a language in in the EMU s clean). It in exists the such a lot of useful places of translation of sole as fishes Babel in the Internets however, the majority he is completely useless and/or insufficient.'''''

Even in one's mother tongue, it's sometimes hard to understand what [[Willis|people are talking about]]. Such cultural 'quirks' as [[leet|slang]], [[rap|patois]], [[retard]]ation and [[Scottish|regional accents]] can make even your fellow countrymen hard to understand. Throw in copious amounts of [[booze]] and [[drugs]] and you may get the following.
