'''Crowdleaks''' (formerly '''Crowdleak''') is an online news outlet born out of the '''Operation Leakspin''' effort. After months of [[DDoS]]'ing from another "Operation" that [http://valleywag.gawker.com/5709789/noose-closes-around-pro+wikileaks-vigilantes we can't mentioned any longer], [[Anonymous]] [[:File:AnonymousvsNewfagVert.jpg|became soft]] and finally decided that the next best way to [[V for Vendetta|make governments fear their people]] was to spread [[Dox|government secrets]] to every corner of the Web. In short, Crowdleaks fights censorship and control with transparency.

Crowdleaks presents this task to participants: To transform obscure leaked cables into newsworthy and accessible articles. Crowdleaks endorses "crowd journalism," which they claim to be their invention despite [http://en.wikinews.org/ previous precedents]. According to Crowdleaks, a bunch of [[basement dwellers]] working [[Wikipedia|together]] can outdo professional journalists due to peer review and the lack of [[Fox News|stoking pro-American cocks]].

During the height of the "Operation that we can't mention any longer", a [[Shota|16-year-old boy]] was arrested in [[the Netherlands]] for using [[LOIC]] against two credit card websites. Disturbed by that fact by a person was arrested for breaking the law, Anons everywhere gather together and resolved to made it near-impossible (if not impossible) for governments to censor the leaked cables.

Anonymous decided to overcome his [[ADD]], develop a sense of patience, and exchange DDoS attacks with short-term benefits in favor of a long, dragged-out dogfight with far-reaching implications. From the first time since [[Chanology]], Anonymous dedicated resources beyond posting [[Operation Madeupname]] posters on chan boards and downloading [[LOIC]]. Websites, IRC channels, and new secure publishing software was created. Anonymous named this effort "Operation Leakspin" after [[Leekspin.com|his favorite Flash and tune]].
