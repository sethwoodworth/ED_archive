Code Geass
[[Image:Lastgeassepisode.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The ending scene.]]

'''Code Geass (pronounced: gay-ass): Lelouch of the Rebellion''' is a [[mechanophile|yaoi mecha]] animu noted for its [[lie|clever and original plot]]. It became the [[the cancer that is killing /b/|the cancer]] of /a/ for the [[Last Thursday|whole summer of 2008]].

The show was created when [[pizza|Pizza Hut]], thinking they could get a bigger piece of the Japanese global market, began writing and producing what would eventually become a new anime that would include [[Bullshit|innovative and brand-new]] elements [[Old media|never seen before]] in the genre: [[Gundam Wing|giant robots]], [[Iraq|large-scale military invasions]], heaps upon heaps of [[necrophilia|still-attractive bishie corpses]] and [[Anna Nicole Smith|more tits than a ''Playboy'' shoot]]. These were all included in an effort to attract [[13-year-old boys|a wider audience]]. The show was largely subsidized by [[Japan]], so the show also features a staggering amount of the [[bullshit]] post-war [[conspiracy|propaganda]] that Japan has so desperately tried to feed the world.

The result, against all odds, [[Lie|was not an altogether bad show]], but then again one can only speak [[One Piece|purely]] [[Inuyasha|in]] [[Naruto|terms]] [[Yu-Gi-Oh|of]] [[Bleach|comparison]].

==The Show==
The anime takes place in an alternative-history world where [[Japan]] has gotten [[pwned]] by the [[England|Holy Empire of Britannia]] thanks to the latter's giant [[DICKGIRL ON WHEELS!!!!111oneoneone!!!|rollerskate-wearing robots]], which are [[dubious disclaimer|clearly more effective]] than tanks and other conventional weapons -- an absurdity, as we see later on that rocket-launchers can fuck them up.

[[Image:Britannia.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The coat of arms of the Holy Britannian Empire consist of a [[penis|Serpent]] and a [[JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR!]]]]

Despite having killer-cool mecha (and lots of [[lesbian|female military officers]] with [[epic win|e-size tits]]), Britannia is still just a bunch of [[English|British]] [[french|Francophone]] [[Nazis]], who want to [[Awesome|take over the world]] and do what [[Hitler]] would [[holocaust|have done]] had he not [[an hero|put bullets in his head]].

And because the Japanese love them some [[Pelosi_kills_Rickrolling|historical revisionism]] almost as much as [[list of sex moves|increasingly bizarre sex practices]], they have taken great pains to ensure that no one notices that Britannia [[irony|is doing everything the Japanese did to the Chinese]] during [[World War II]]. 

===First Season===
[[Lyndon Larouche|Lelouch Lamperouge]] is the repulsively unlikable [[attention whore|main character]] -- a pretentious [[bitch]] who lives his life in the lap of luxury, surrounded by [[vagina|beautiful women]] [[gay|whom he has absolutely no attraction to]]. This self-indulgent lifestyle apparently is not enough for the spoiled aristocratic cunt, so for the sake of the plot ([[divide by zero|and nothing else]]) he one day wakes up with a terrible case of [[butthurt]] over [[Shit nobody cares about|the way the Japanese people are being treated]]. 

He enthusiastically joins up with the local [[basement dweller|Japanese revolutionaries]], but because he didn't have an invitation he had to [[oral sex|convince them]] that he was worthy. Reluctant to admit his [[fagolescence|sexual preferences]], Lulu (his nickname -- as if you didn't think he was gay already) was suddenly [[almost rape|accosted]] by a green-haired [[bitch]] everybody thought to be dead -- in doing so, he promptly receives [[Death Note|unique paranormal superpowers]] called "Geass" (moar liek "Gayass", amirite?).

Things get needlessly complicated when it turns he's the son of the [[Lioncash|Emperor of Britannia]] himself, but because Lelouch is so [[internet tough guy|noble and true]] to his word, he sallies forth to perform [[white knighting|heroic]] acts [[for great justice]] against his father's [[America|evil political state]]. He does so with the pretentious insistence that he, a [[Karl Rove|strategic genius]], can never be defeated, despite [[pwn|getting his ass handed to him]] about every other episode.

[[Image:Partyhardgeass.gif|right|frame|Yeah, Euphie! Go on with ya bad self!]]

His fianc√© is [[fag|Suzaku Kururugi]], a green-eyed, brown-haired [[Azn]] (because clearly Azns always have green eyes and brown hair) who has decided to join the Britannians because he firmly believes in his [[asspie|childhood ideals]]. Although the two are engaged to be married, they only fight when they're [[internet|inside their Mechs]] because they don't know they're actually not enemies... kinda like [[Death Note|another anime]] you may have seen.

Lelouch declares himself the [[white knighting|defender of justice]], calling himself "Zero," a name and number which the Japanese seem to have a weird [[fetish]] for. After creating the [[Monty Python|Black Knights]] as a kind of [[Watchmen|pathetic vigilante group]], he starts to [[ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH|fight back against his own nation]]. 

During the course of the show (and again, [[divide by zero|for no particular reason]]), Lulu finds his awesomely hot sister [[Hillary Clinton|Euphemia]], who professes a pressing need for [[furry|white and fluffy]] storyline development. Lulu objects, but after being offered to get [[incest|into her sister's panties]] (no, [[srsly]], there's that one episode where he says his sis was his first [[fuck|love]]) he readily reconsiders. 

The two of them gather [[over 9000|a whole lot]] of people in a closed stadium surrounded by armed military men -- always an [[unrealistic expectations|auspicious start]] for creating a "white and fluffy world." While there, Euphemia asks Lulu to go to a dark backroom, where he [[I accidentally X|accidentally her]], causing the bitch to spontaneously go where [[Warren G. Harding|Harry Truman]] pussed out and give some Japs the [[wrestling|smackdown]] they so richly deserve. She [[VT|grabs herself a gun]] and starts to [[party hard|party down like a pro]].

Lulu, in order to hide the fact that he [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|made such a colossal error]], kills her, causing yet another [[Fullmetal Alchemist|needless character death]] (there are several in this anime and it's not even ''done'' by Gainax). Watch the [[JewTube]] clip to catch all the filthy action:

<center><youtube>7JQ4sWzXPiA</youtube></center>

He then proceeds to go on an epic [[cocksucking rampage|rampage]] against the Britannians and [[doesn't afraid of anything]]. He raises a [[superpower|huge fucking army]], and almost takes over Japan, before his army of [[retards|inept morons]] goes down in [[epic fail|spectacular failure]] and start to lose the second [[retard|Lelouch]] leaves to go save his useless, whiny, blind, cripple [[loli]] sis. Lelouch's army apparently forgot there's a reason why Britannia controls 2/3rds of the world. 

When he arrives to the place he thought he'd find his worthless [[cunt]] of a sister, [[a challenger appears]] to start the decisive battle...and the [[Rage|WHOLE MOTHER FUCKING SEASON ENDS RIGHT THEN AND THERE]].

===Second Season (R2)===
The story should have ended there, but no... just when you thought it [[Spengbab|couldn't get any worse]], it always [[pain series|does]].

You see, [[at least 100 years ago|one day]], some executives from Sunrise (the morons that made this [[Ray Jones|confused mess]] of an animu) decided to communally smoke some expensive [[marijuana|weed]] to get inspiration for new ideas. This proved to be a [[epic fail|terrible mistake]], as they all agreed in their [[Blagogate|collectively impaired judgment]] to make a second season for ''Code Geass''. 

This happens quite a lot: <s>a good</s> anime [[Gurren Lagann|will go horrifyingly down the shitter when an addition is made to the original story]]. And because [[World War II|the Japanese never learn from their mistakes]], a second season had to be made for ''Code Geass'' as well so that it, too, could be [[Krystal Can't Enjoy Her Sandwich|epically ruined]].
[[Image:Geass341.jpg|right|thumb|430px|Lelouch ''finally'' puts those powers of his to good use.]]
It was already clear for the viewers that this continuation would be a bigass trainwreck from the get-go when a new lead character, [[Jett Travolta|Rolo]], was introduced. It didn't take [[Stephen Colbert|a genius]] to figure that this [[Chris Crocker|whiny faggot]] would prove to be the improbable animu version of [[FurAffinity|Scrappy-Doo]] -- a younger, stupider, uglier, infinitely more annoying version of the main character.

Things could only get worse from there: the continuity of the entire fucking show was totally ignored, [[copypasta|so that the first seven episodes were made by following the same damn scenario as the first season]], leaving [[weeaboo|the viewers]] to wonder whether this new incarnation of ''Code Geass'' will be a similar [[fail|disappointment]] as ''[[Higurashi]]'', a.k.a [[loli|''Nipah~'']], where the timeline is reset practically every episode.

And so, after re-experiencing the whole plot, the viewer is treated to what amounts to a gigantic animated clusterfuck: Lelouch finds himself owning the entire [[world]] having made [[bullshit|a pretty fair trade-in of China against Japan]]. He is now surrounded by an entirely new cast (of course), including a [[Chinese]] [[loli|princess]] and her pedo knight, a [[Incest|fake brother]] that Lelouch intends to use and dump later, as well hundreds of [[X is not your personal army|other nations leaders]] that he infected with [[Herpes|Geass]] so that they would join him. So he finds himself being the new [[A challenger appears|leader of half of the world]], and goes on to [[W|kick his father's ass]] who owns the other half.

The plot jumps to [[Brandon Crisp|Rolo]] taking Lelouch to the [[West Virginia|Wonderland of Joy]], and dying from the [[Seaking|divine punishment]] of using the [[Za Warudo]] move that was way too cool for a [[faggot]] like him. Lelouch suddenly (once again, [[divide by zero|for no particular reason]]) finds his [[Mindfuck|sense of purpose in life]]...and then [[LARP|levels up]] his Geass to level 50 to battle against a [[LOL WUT|floating Jupiter-like thing]] on the ceiling that came from a [[basement dweller|hidden dimension in his basement]]. By this point, no one who watched the show [[Rickroll|knew what the fuck was going on]].

Lelouch finally makes good on his engagement to Suzaku and [[Marriage is love|happily marries him]]... but then finds himself in a world turned [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZRwol_qFW4 upside down face], so now in control of the [[bad]] guy's side half of the world, fighting against the good guys. 

Theoretically the show could have [[Bailout Plan|spiraled even further out of control]], but luckily it didn't, because shortly thereafter the show then meets an unexpectedly simple ending, and everybody lives happily ever after. Thank the [[Raptor Jesus|fucking Lord]].

[[Image:CodeGayass.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Wikipedia|TOW]] makes sure you always find what you're looking for.]]

===Hey, It Happens All the Time===
Apparently the people that made ''Code Geass'' thought it a [[epic fail|bright idea]] to make every episode end [[samefag|the same way]] in order to make the show popular. Despite what many with [[common knowledge|common sense]] would readily figure out, all the [[otaku|loyal fans]] still took [[Delicious cake|the bait]]. 

At the end of each episode, one or more of these [[lie|totally unpredicted]] happenings occur:
*Good guy becomes bad guy
*Bad guy becomes good guy
*Unexpected truth is revealed
*[[Fullmetal Alchemist|One of the main characters dies]]
*Somebody turns out to actually [http://are-are.net/2008/09/22/code-geass-r2-stage-24-again-fleia-is-not-a-very-effective-weapon/ not to be dead] even after getting a goddam [[Ronald Reagan|nuke dropped on them]].

===Opening Themes===
Like many animu, ''Code Geass'' features [[over 9000|way too many]] opening sequences and songs to go with them. Here's a rundown:

*'''Flow - COLOURS''' 
<s>huge, booming, [[epic]] anthem that [[you fail it|impresses nobody]] because it clearly [[trying too hard|tries way too fucking hard]]</s> 
'''JIBUN WOOOOOOOOO~'''
*'''Jinn - "Kaidoku Funou"''' 
A Japanese girl shrieking into a microphone in a [[fail|failed effort]] to "sing", ending up sounding more like the audio to some [[sick fuck|weird porno]] with a Japanese girl shrieking into a microphone while scraping her [[vagina]] with sandpaper over a guitar track being played by some hobo they found on a street corner.
*'''Access - "Hitomi no Tsubasa"''' 
Mind-melting, ultra-hyper explosion of glittery, super-saccharine [[J-Rock|J-Techno]] from [[gay|the people]] that brought you the soundtrack to ''[[Gravitation]]''. Listening to it will make the world [[LSD|seem sparkly and wonderful]].
*'''Orange Range - "02"'''
The same guys who did the first [[Bleach]] opening bring you <s>a semi-crappy J-rock/rap that leaves you dissatisfied.</s> '''I continue to fight!!!'''
*'''Flow - "World End"'''
The dudes from OP 1 are back with an even [[MOAR]] overly-epic theme song. This one is on every [[weeaboo]] fangirl's MP3 player.

'''When These Powers Combine:''' The fan-made OP below combines the best parts of the OPs to make a truly [[EPIC]] video. (Sry for being [[srs]].)

==Characters==
*'''[[Lyndon Larouche|Lelouch]]''': Main character of the series. Watched ''[[Anonymous|V For Vendetta]]'' one too many times and decided to go for it because, well, he has superpowers, after all. Nicknamed "Lulu". [[Srsly|No, really]]. Also has a strange tendency to [[pwn|mercilessly kill]] people around him for no apparent reason, perhaps because of their knowledge of his [[gay|true sexuality]] and the fact that his name sounds very much like "the douche." He was recently caught homosexually making out with his "theoretical enemy" Suzaku Kururugi. (Milly Ashford recently informed the media about this information.) He is also known as Zero, a super hero/villain/twig/kitteh that wins his battles by weird hand gestures.

[[Image:SuzakuAwesome.jpg‚Äé|thumb|left|Even Suzaku can be [[awesome]] sometimes.]]

*'''[[Tom Cruise|Suzaku]]''': Lelouch's <s>childhood friend</s> boyfriend. Had the bright idea that [[facepalm|killing his dad would bring peace and joy, and stop Britannia from taking over Japan]]. Even after his anus was [[goatse|made three times larger]] by his Britannian fellow soldiers, he still [[retard|keeps on believing]] he does it all for a [[for great justice|a righteous and worthy cause]].

[[Image:Destroybritania.jpg|thumb|right|250px|How Lelouch imagines it, using the same irritating chess metaphor every episode.]]

*'''[[Brandon Crisp|Rolo]]''': An [[13 year old boy|16 year old boy]] who is clearly [[asking for it]] like the demented [[fanboy]] that he is. He keeps humping <s>his brother's</s> Lelouch's leg with hopes to fulfill [[Buttsecks|his dream]] of becoming [[fagolescence|just like him]]. He can cast [[Za Warudo]], but because of his [[faggotry|inherent weaknesses]], the results are always [[An Hero|embarrassingly bad]].

*'''[[Nevada-tan|Kallen]]''': A pink-haired half-Azn who joins the Black Knights. Absolutely the Hottest character on the show. People claim she looks like Sakura from Naruto, but can't notice that the hair,eyes, and face are all different, proving their point moot. She does have a set of rockin' [[tits]], which you get to see in the episode "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?p=4F052E545F5BC5B2&index=18&feature=PlayList&v=3oUokhLOSrg Island Of The Gods]".
[[Image:euphie.gif|left]]

*'''[[Hillary Clinton|Princess Euphemia]]''': She's a homicidal freak continuously pretending to be in love with Suzaku when she actually wishes to be a porn star at playboy. Eventually she has kills many because she didn't get the lead for playboy. Eventually Euphemia (aka Euphie) gets killed by her brother because she flirted with Suzaku. ((yay for her death!))

*'''[[Kike|Ohgi]]''': While he pretends to be a Jap, his [[African|curly hair]] and the [[Holocaust|yellow badge]] from the [[Hitler|Third Reich]] on his jacket all reveal that he is in fact a Jew. He was one of the original terrorists, which should surprise nobody, as it is well-known that Jews [[Jews did WTC|delight in doing terrible things to the world]].

*'''[[Ann Coulter|Villetta Nu]]''': A silver-haired tanorexic [[bitch]] who is significant only because she was one of the first people Lelouch [[raped|mindfucked]], and because you get to see her [[tits]] as well. Later on she [[Soap opera|gets amnesia]] and [[In the kitchen|lives with]] the token Jew of the show (Ohgi) until he [[Pregnant|impregnates]] her at the end of the 2nd season. 

[[Image:Code_Geass_61.jpg‚Äé|thumb|right|200px|C.C., the token cumwhore of the show.]]

*'''[[TITTY MONSTER|C.C.]]''': Lelouch's [[prostitute|ladyfriend]] who follows him around like a green-haired [[buy a dog|puppy]]. Gave Lelouch the [[herpes|Geass]] early on in the show. She was born [[100 years ago|hundreds of years ago]] as part of another [[divide by zero|needless plot twist]]. After spending many years excelling as a reliable [[Woman|semen swallower]] for everyone she met, her [[vagina]] was, despite her eternal youth, worn out so badly that she wanted to die. Her death, she requested, be as her life, [[bukkake|with cum all over her face]]. Been known to [[I came|spontaneously orgasm]] at the sight of Pizza Hut merchandise.

*'''[[Lioncash|XCVIII Emperor of Britannia, Charles di Britannia]]''': The emperor of 2/3rds of the world, he's also a massive [[Evangelion]] fanboy who thought it would be a [[nice try|cool idea]] to copy the plot, and do a shitty job of it. His favorite quotes are [[OH GOD BILL|"ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!"]] and [[Republican|"People are not equal."]] He dies by turning into a [[cock|magical rocket]]. He seems to have been the only heterosexual man in his family, and [[secks|going for it]] so much that the number of his legitimate [[baby|predecessors]] alone is measurable in ''[[over 9000|three fucking digits]]''. Not mentioning the fact that he admitted having [[WTF|preserved Lulu's mom's original body]] so that he could [[Necrophilia|use it later]].

*'''[[Jesus is Hitler|Schneizel el Britannia]]''': Lelouch's big bro who has a truly irritating habit of [[Gary_Oak|showing up at inopportune times]] and, resultingly, [[GTFO|turning whatever episode he appears into prime horseshit]]. An excellent example of how the males in ''Code Geass'' are all [[bishie syndrome|sickeningly pretty]]. His retarded name is an endless source of [[lulz|humour at his expense]].

*'''[[Budd Dwyer|Clovis la Britannia]]''': <s>Another of Lelouch's big bros and</s> Dude it doesn't matter, [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|he got his brains blown out in the third fucking episode]].

*'''[[Sarah Palin|Marianne]]''': Lelouch's mother and one of Emperor Charles' [[whore|concubines]]. She's <s>dead</s> <s>still alive</s> dead, and <s>is</s> was a [[whore]] for her entire life.

*'''[[Babyfuck|Nunnally]]''':[[Disabled Village Children|Crippled]], whiny, ignorant, pretentious whore who happens to be Lelouch's [[Incest|sister]]. After [[Goggles|doing nothing]] throughout the whole thing, it turns out at the end she not only [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|faked being blind the entire time]], but also somehow botched the opportunity to [[apocalypse|destroy the entire world]]. Why? Because she's a damn cripple, and she's going to [[Hell]] (and you could see her nipples in one of the episodes).

*'''[[Mary Sue|Li Xingke]]''': The [[Chinese]] guy that appears in the second season. He's a combination of both Lelouch and Suzaku, except he's less [[gay]] and less [[retarded]], which seems to [[divide by zero|contradict]] the entire show. He's also an active [[Pedobear|pedo]].

*'''[[Bikerfox|Diethard]]''': [[Sarcasm|Supercool]] news reporter with equally [[sarcasm|supercool]] news reporter hair. He is only good for two things: [[an hero|getting shot]] and crying like [[Your Mom|a bitch]] in the final episodes, and the fact that his name [[LOL WUT|forms an exact rhyme]] with "[[retard]]".

*'''[[Bitch|Nina]]''': A [[fugly]] xenophobic failure both at life [[an hero|and death]], only good for being useless, [[WTF|raping tables]], and having the inexplicable surname [[Wikipedia:List_of_Code_Geass_characters#Nina_Einstein|"Einstein"]]. Oh, and she also invents a [[Internets|nuke]], not that anyone cares. She has a one-sided, [[rape|obsessive lesbian love affair]] with [[Hillary Clinton|Princess Euphemia]], and has an epic freakout when Lelouche kills her. See the [[Jewtube]] vid on how she rapes the table.

*'''[[Rapist|Gino]]''': A [[fugly]] homicidal [[rapist]] who is sexually attracted to Lelouch until one day Suzaku buries him alive. He serves no point to the story other than to try to seduce Kallen, but his moves fail on her, because he is clearly a dirty Mexican Jew.

*'''[[Loli|Anya]]''': Emotionless Rei Clone that starts appearing in the Second Season, completely boring with no personality, yet so many people like her. In reality she is Lelouch's Mom, which further begs the Question "How?". Bandai wanted her to be the New Rei and get lots of merchandise made of her, but they failed because they are Bandai.

There's also like [[at least 100|a hundred]] other characters in this show that [[nobody cares]] about or remembers.

==FAQ For Fags==
[[Image:Geass.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Oh sure, yeah, [[emo|I'd be crying too]] if I had all that ridiculous power.]]

Because ''Code Geass'' just might be the most confused thing you've yet seen on [[YouTube|your television]] next to the [[OVER 9000|six-hundred million]] or so filler episodes of ''[[Naruto]]'', here's a quick rundown of the questions that will inevitably arise:

===Just What the Hell Is This "Geass" Crap, Anyway?===
Geass, also pronounced as [[goatse|"gay-ass"]], is a [[herpes|sexually transmitted disease]] that modifies your DNA and gives you amazing powers. [[LARP|This skill can be leveled up]], and by reaching the [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|level 99]] you can gain access to [[God Mode]].

Lelouch's "Geass" ability is to make anyone do whatever he wants, no matter how absurd or immoral. Regrettably, [[rape|what he really should have used it for]] never appears in the series, but then again, that's what [[Yaoi]] fanfiction is for, [[amirite]]?

'''Pro Tip:''' "Geass" is a variation of an ancient [[Celtic]] word that means "contract" or "curse".

===Wait, Haven't I Seen This Shit Before?===
Why yes, [[Common knowledge|yes you have]].

After watching a few episodes, you'll get a strange feeling of [[mindfuck|d√©j√† vu]]. You see, this plot was originally played out on ''[[Death Note]]''.

The main difference between ''Code Geass'' and ''[[Death Note]]'' is that the latter is about creepy [[emo]] kids, while the former is about significantly-less-creepy-and-emo [[terrorist]] and [[Nazi|Fascist]] kids -- although both contain the seemingly mandatory overload of [[yaoi|delicious Japanese homolust]].

Both contain and equal amount of tiresomely ambiguous homosexual situations, as if [[Naruto|Shounen Jump]] needed any more [[faggotry]]. 

===You Mean They Made A Manga Too?===
[[Image:Powarg.jpg|thumb|right|185px|It may be even [[X in my y|less original than you think]].]]

Well, [[DO IT FAGGOT|duh]].

Someone had the bright idea to add some mango to this ghastly train-wreck of an animu -- in fact, to add several mangos that all have various degrees of [[failure]] to account for. 

The best known of these [[My Immortal|gems of literature]] is ''Nightmare of Nunnally'', where Lelouch's helpless, worthless, whiny, stupid, and [[Rick Santorum|just plain annoying]] sister Nunnally suddenly gets [[OH GOD BILL|amazing superpowers]]. She can summon a stylish mecha that [[lie|looks totally nothing like]] something from [[NGE|Neon Genesis Evangelion]], has the ability to see into the [[future]] and, most importantly, she can create a doppelg√§nger to finally satisfy [[lesbian|her natural needs]] -- as she's a [[Disabled Village Children|cripple]] and can't [[masturbation|reach it]] otherwise. 

However, the [[Conspiracy|actual manga]] has remained hidden for a [[100 years ago|very long time]], and only recently has a link to it been discovered. [http://akibakko.net/tag/code_geachu/page/2 Click here] to discover the true meaning of [[TL;DR]].

[[Image:Geassgeass.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Sweet delicious [[yaoi]], yes sir.]]

*''Action'': 9/10. It's about taking over teh world and giant robots, after all.
*''Lulz'': 4/10. The parts where it tries to be funny, fails. There are exceptions: the moment when a [[chink]] named [[Mao]] tries to chainsaw C.C. and [[Guro|stuff her into a bag]], and when the Britfags decide to [[kill it with fire|burn down]] the Jap ghetto and shoot all the motherfuckers [[I did it for the lulz|for teh lulz]].
*''Faggotry'': 20/10. Out of all [[animu]] you'd ever watch, this one doesn't even need to be [[Shoop|shooped]] to look gay, screenshots alone are enough. The way main characters look and dress (and ''jump'') are shockingly homosexual, especially the combined efforts of Lelouch and Suzaku. Gayness is outright implied in more than a few parts: when Rolo approaches Lulu saying, "I will be always with you" and, and practically every other conversation between Lelouch and Suzaku. Just look for [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy8i-Szbc4Y "OH GEASS NO"] on [[YouTube]]. 
*''Furry Fandom'': 4/10. They dress up in animal costumes for some reason in one episode, and the pink-haired cumwhore dresses as a giant [[Fursuit|green beaver]] in another.
*''Product Placement'': 30/10. Just for the Hell of it, try taking a shot every time you see a Pizza Hut logo. Be warned: you may die of alcohol poisoning.
