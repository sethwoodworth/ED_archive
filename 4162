J-emo

[[image:20050918_02.jpg|thumb|right|Meet the fall of man.]]
'''J-Emo''' is an unofficial (but appropriate) term for [[retarded]] [[Emo]] kids who obsess over [[Anime|Japan]], [[animu]], [[J-pop]], and [[JROCK#Visual Kei|Visual Gay]]. This [[bullshit]] genre of 'music',[[JROCK#Visual Kei|Visual Gei]], features [[cock]]-lacking men dressing up as women and throwing up blood on their fanwhores. Most J-Emos' are [[16-year-old girl|16 year old girls]] and [[13_year_old_boy|13 year old boys]], though there have been many sightings recently of J-Emos 35+ years of age. All J-Emos are females, because the males who join the cult are required to give up their manhood as a sacrifice before earning their membership.

The worst J-Emo populations can be found in [[Germany]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[France]] and [[California]], due to the unbelievably high amount of [[faggotry]] in teenagers and popularity of [[suicide]]-oriented music. Unfortunately, this new form of [[cancer]] seems to be spreading to other areas as well, quickly becoming a world-wide epidemic.

== How to spot a J-Emo in the wild ==
[[image:Visualkei_wapa.jpg|thumb|right|Typical J-Emo whore.]]
J-Emos can be easily mistaken as a typical [[weeaboo]] or [[emo]] kid, however it's important to note that they are actually a hybrid of the two, thus making them twice as bad and possibly twice as ugly. A J-Emo's 'natural' habitat mainly revolves around places such as: the mall, [[anime]] conventions, sushi restaurants, any 'Chinatown' or [[AZN]] themed place within a city. (This includes [[AZN]] food markets as well.) Once you are in their preferred environment, they should quickly become easy to spot. J-Emo usually have most if not all of the following:

* Four pairs of mismatching brightly colored stockings/socks per leg. This tends to make their legs look lumpy and swollen.
* Slashed wrists, [[cutting]] marks, scars proudly on public display.
* Poorly dyed hair of a unnatural shade, usually already faded and seems unwashed. Hairstyles can vary from the typical [[AZN]] style [[mullet]] to a nappier, almost [[Amy Winehouse]]-esqe mess.
* Caked on makeup, usually resembling some sort of clown-whore or the corpse of a rotting [[prostitute]].
* Anything with annoying '[[retarded|Kawaii]]' characters such as Gloomy bear or [[Hello Kitty]].
* Dressed either like a [[Hot Topic]] reject on [[meth]] or some disturbing mix of a homeless person, [[Ronald Mcdonald]], and a room full of washed up rave kids. Some may only wear '[[moonspeak|burando]]' clothing from such brands as: Sex Pot Revenge, h.Naoto, as well as various [[EGL|rorita]] brands.
* Works at [[Hot Topic]], an anime/videogame store, or a [[AZN]] restaurant.
* Attempts to speak in a '[[retarded|Kawaii]]' way, usually spouting out mangled Japonaiz they learned from their favorite [[anime]] or J-drama show.
* Token [[AZN]] friend or boyfriend, usually a cheap [[Japan|Jap]] imitation, such as [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea|Korean]] or [[Philippines|Filipino]].
* Calling themselves and their friends by '[[retarded|Kawaii]]' Japonaiz names such as: Aiko, Aki, Kei, Miku, Sakura.

Keep in mind that J-Emos usually hunt for their [[AZN]] prey in packs. They are easy to provoke, but lack any real defense, usually resorting to whining a ear-piercing "[[moonspeak|BAKA]]" before attempting to flee. They make wonderfully easy targets due to this lack of defense. Others may attempt to fake a tough attitude, but will avoid fights at all costs to protect their hair/makeup/clothing from damage.

== As Sources of [[Lulz]] ==

Considering their lack of intelligence and need for [[drama]], the J-Emo can be a great souce of [[lulz]] and there are many ways to achieve this. [[Troll]] LiveJournals, [[MySpace]], [[DeviantART]] accounts, forums, and various other places the J-Emo whore around. Some simple ways to do so are:

* Insult [[anime|the Japanese]]. ([[babyfuck]] and [[pwned|WW2]] references encouraged.)
* Tell them the [[truth]] of [[Japan|Japanese culture]]. (pedophilia, racism, sexism, rape/abuse, and how the Nips themselves worship the [[Greek|Greeks]]. You lulz as they turn in all their overpriced Hot Topic [[animu]] for precious BAKLAVA!)
* Pretend to be a Japanese person, use their new-found obsession with you [[sex|to your advantage]].
* Hack their accounts, post private information/pictures online for all to see.
* A J-emo will most likely get srsly butthurt if you remind them that [[Gay|Visual Kei]] is just a [[shit|shittier]] regurgitation of equally shitty 80's Glam metal bands.
Because of their serious need for [[attention]] and a reputation as an [[internet_tough_guy|internet badass]], the J-Emos will arrange an internet counter-attack with all their [[retarded]] might. What they don't realize is that their poor attempt at internet winning makes them even more [[fail]]. A good example can be found here [http://irc-galleria.net/channel.php?channel_id=1755699].
