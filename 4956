Long-winded people
[[Image:RuneScapesgreatest.JPG|thumb|right|A [[typical|fine]] example of long-windedness.]]
'''Long-winded people''' are living proof that you don't need to be [[retard|exceptionally smart]] to become a prolific [[troll]]. [[Some argue]] that long-winded people try to [[DDoS]] your brain.

==Detecting long-winded people in the wild==
[[Contrary to popular belief]], a long post is not necessarily a sign of a long-winded troll.

[[You]] can distinguish this particular kind of troll by their [[circular logic|constant repetition of the same stupid argument thorought their post]], and over-analyzing (badly) a given problem. They will often add insult to injury by using [[grammar nazi|bad]] [[retard|grammer]] and going on for a couple of pages without '''any''' use of punctuation. This makes for the most irritating read you could find on the [[interbutts]].

==Trolling==
Trolling those people is great fun, because they are obviously unable of producing coherent replies. Be cautious, however, because most [[unfunny]] forums don't see being incredibly annoying as an offence. Instead of insulting them try to argue with them. Most of them should slip soon enough and do something [[ban]]worthy (and [[lulz]]worthy, to be sure), which will result in them losing the internets.
