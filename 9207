Xenosaga
{{spoilers|text=some spaceships blow up, robots may or may not be Jesus, the good guys die}} 

'''''Xenosaga''''' is a series of 3 games for the craptasic [[Playstation]] 2. Originally designed to be 6 parts long, but was cut short down to 3 because Namco [[fail|can't pull their shit together]]. The games were produced by Nazis, as evident in the titles (''Episode 1: Der Wille von FÃ¼hrer'', ''Episode 2: Sieg Heil Van Halen'', and ''Episode 3: Thus Sprach Goebbels'').

==Premise of the Game==

The game starts when someone pulled a Black Mesa [[Large Hadron Collider]] causing the Earth to implode. In every game, you play as Gaignun Kukai Jr. and Shion, who is his behind the scenes [[ho]]. Shion earns the ability to wear less and less clothing, and she's also a whiny fuck whom every character wishes to just peel off her skin and dump her in a tub of salt (or fuck her, whichever works. Doesn't matter since she's just a bunch of polygons anyway) she also is gay for her skank robot who she appearently knew [[over 9000|over 9000]] years ago. Jr., the male lead, is a crusty 30 year old man trapped in a preteen's body with a dead girlfriend complex who refuses to put out to anyone else. Although people that play the game don't even really care about him go on about minor characters and how they are so special when they are really Jr.'s lapdog bitches. In addition, there are a number of other characters who join Jr., including a [[loli]] Magic gurl, [[Optimus Prime|Jesus Christ]], an <del>otaku ^_^</del> weeaboo [[Wapanese|samurai]], and a [[pedophile|pedophilic]] Cyborg. Let's not forgot the big fap object KOS-MOS.	
 
Every game is actually not really a game, but a long cinema similar to ''[[Kill Bill|Final Fantasy XII]]''. For every 2 minutes of gameplay in ''Xenosaga'', there are [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|OVER 9,000]] hours of movies. No lie. It is one of the first games ever to have a save point in the middle of a fucking cinema. However, despite this fact, many fans fap about how great the game is. In fact, some fans go so far as to say that it is better than ''Final Fantasy''. On forums. Thus, [[lulz]] ensue as [[fanboys]] flame each other's series.	 
	 
===LOLICON!?!===

The [[loli]] character, MOMO, is of particular interest, because she's 10. And she has the most revealing outfits of all of the characters (except Shion in episode three, due to the inverse proportion of Sequel # to Shion's Clothed Body). MOMO also has the most revealing swimsuits. [[Some argue|Many argue]], including [[pedophiles]] themselves, that the game makers were pedophiles.  Anyone who disagrees is clearly [[stupid]]; a [[typical]] screenshot from the [[animu]] (shown right) puts all doubt to rest. In addition, another character [[rape|rapes]] MOMO off-camera during a cinema, calling her "his peach" (a subtle metaphor to the peachfuzz on her puss). The sad thing is, she's not even a human. MOMO is not the only one either. [[At least 100]] 100-Series units are in the game, and the [[sick fuck]] that raped MOMO also faps to those. Below: actual, unaltered screenshots that further confirm the [[pedophilia]] from the animu.

===The [[Animu]]===

Seeing as how the game is more focused on plot than actual gameplay, it was inevitable that the Japs would make a fucking [[anime]] out of it. However, in an outstanding display of [[failure]], instead of focusing on making the storyline good, it ended up being even more badly written than the games storyline. In fact, it's so bad that the games fanbase (which is at least 90% [[weaboo]]) hates it just as much as everybody else. Also, the animation actually looks crappier than the games PS2 graphics, which some say is just as bad as [[divide by zero|dividing by zero]].

===[[16 year old girls]] love the series===

The main character has some issues with his twin brother which induces lots of 16 year old fangurls writing [[buttsecks|buttsex]] fanfiction on how they're [[ALL CAPS|SO ANGRY AT EACH OTHER, THEY JUST REALLY WANNA FUCK, THEY LOVE EACHOTHER KAWAII!!]] ^_^[[oneoneone|!!1!]] [[DESU]] DESU DESU! He also has BLUE EYES and a fancy name like most RPG tard heads which is deemed COOL to the [[geeks]]. No one gives a damn about this game and it's crapped ''Days of Our Lives'' story line except with sucky character development, that doesn't even show how some characters romance evolves in the game, "My lover is dead I think I'll love you now let's place hints all over the games and make two scenes where we talk alone. Oh no I'm sorry I betrayed you and I went back to my douche lover, now you want to kill me because I pissed you off even though we hardly talk at all. FORGIVE ME!" Yes that is seriously how these shit games are played out. With all those damn cinemas you'd think they'd developed that cockshit out. And also do the other characters have a reason to be there? No, they're just "aids" dressed in an embarrassing fashion and add in some 2 cents every 5 hours. Man, fuck RPGs. (He's probably fucking his brother anyway according to the fangurls)

This game features [[vore]], [[pedophiles]], mechanophiles, sci-fi nerds, and RPG players, [[typical|typically]] the scum of society.
