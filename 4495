'''Karma''' is an idea created by a bunch of chinks and towelheads to make themselves feel better about their pointless, random lives. In its most basic form it asserts that a big something or other is sitting up in nowhere land and keeping track of all the times you [[fap]] to [[cp]]. In this way Karma is alot like [[Santa]], except that if you're naughty you get your ass pounded by Vishnu's cosmic dick. The actual effects of karma vary depending on if you're talking to a towelhead or a hippie, from reincarnation as a steak on legs with the former to swallowing a burning joint with the later. Pretty much, you fuck around with people, the universe fucks with you. 
'''Karma''' is also a statistic in the old Marvel Superheroes RPG. It replaced the tedious rigamarole of "leveling up" or "experience points" with the tedious rigamarole of trying not to actully KILL your opponents in the game.

==The Truth About Karma==
Karma in its original true meaning from Hindu and Buddhism had nothing to do with morality.  Karma was actually pretty much the [[Scientology]] idea of [[engram]]s.  [[Seriously]].  Yes, very seriously.  It was basically things like if you get born into a family where your dad rapes you up the ass all your childhood and that fucks you up mentallly for the rest of your life, when you die the [[Necronomicon|Lovecraftian]] [[Cthulhu|wheels of reincarnation]] will put you into a similar childhood again thinking, "Well here's some [[thetan]] that's used to the experience so it's a good match."  Or if you were the school bully as a child, you'll reincarnate into a very strong human body in your next life so you can continue doing what's familar to you.

==Places You Can Go To Spend Karma==
Nowhere, as it is just a pathetic attempt to force morals on people who would much rather be raping children. By being on ED you already have a massively negative Karma score, meaning that if Karma does turn out to be real you're coming back as a crack baby.
