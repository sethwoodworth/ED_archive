'''Teksoqp''' is another inane online [[meme]] created by the crackheads at [[YTMND]].  It serves as living proof that YTMNDers are not only crackheads, but alcoholic lunatics, and furries as well.

==Origins==
Teksoqp was created by State-of-Mind, a raging alcoholic and a registered sex offender.  When his midget granny porn didn't download fast enough, in a fit of inebriated fury he threw together the very first Teksoqp website.  [[13-year-old boy]]s call it a parody of the anti-[[Scientology]] site, "The Unfunny Truth About Scientology," most call it [[Insanity|madness]].

Then another user named Moheevi became so intrigued with Teksoqp that he wrote a song about Nude Monkies.  Naturally, the entire population of YTMND gravitated towards this site, as they are all [[furries]] and [[basement dweller]]s who like [[bestiality]]. 

Nude Monkies paved the way for many more teksoqp sites, each one making no sense at all.

==The Point==
No point, sorry.  Teksoqp.
