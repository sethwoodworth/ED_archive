'''Uruguay''' is a giant soccer camp in [[South America]].

== History ==
[[Image:rubenrada.jpg|thumb|Current Uruguayan president]]

Uruguay (moar liek U R GAY amirite?) is like Brazil and Argentina's little brother, it's capital is Montevideo. The name Uruguay was invented by one of the first [[troll]]s in history, because it is similar to 'U R [[Gay]]' which caused lots of [[lulz]] in the past. When the name didn't cause lulz anymore, Uruguay called his big brothers to make war against Paraguay and steal the "South America's [[Switzerland]]" title from them and have that new name. Even though the alliance won, for some weird reason, they decided that it would be Uruguay's nickname which was even funnier, because Uruguay has neither mountains nor secret bank accounts. 

Other aliases :

*Paraguay
*[[Banana]] Republic (also causes lots of [[lulz]] because there are no bananas in Uruguay)

== Geography ==

Uruguay is 5 times smaller than an average penthouse in [[Miami]].

== People ==

Beside cows scattered all over the country, there are gauchos (they are like cowboys but more [[gay]] and zoophiliac) in the north, shitty rock band members in the center, soccer players in the south and pot smoking [[leftard]] [[hippies]] in the east. In the west there are also people but you can't tell the difference between them and the cows.
The national sport is [http://www.noborders.net/mate mate], lawn-mowing and catering to the obnoxious Argentine upper class.

== Government ==

Past presidents :

[[At least 100 years ago]] until [[last Thursday]] : Columbus

*1993-1998 : [[W]]
*1999-2005 : [[The Man]]

The current government consists basically of a council with a president, many cows and very experienced barbecue chefs.

== Economy ==

Uruguayans are too busy drinking [http://www.noborders.net/mate mate] to do anything else. They also use it as their currency;

*20 [http://www.noborders.net/mate mate] = 1 US [[dollar]]

'''Main exports:'''

*[http://www.noborders.net/mate/ mate] drinking people

== Military ==

Uruguayans use stones, clubs and [http://www.noborders.net/mate mate] to defend their territory. They also use their traditional music to attack other countries. The Uruguayan government however, makes citizens believe that foreigners actually love their music.
