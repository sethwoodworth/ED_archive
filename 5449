Mixtapes
__NOTOC__

'''Mixtapes''' are an [[Old meme|obsolete]] form of [[art]] in which one compiles several different recordings onto the same [[Old media|media]], acting as a [[DJ]] of sorts, but with less talent and a shitty dual-deck tape recorder. Most commonly, mixtapes are made to be given to a prospective [[16-year-old girl|girlfriend]] in a [[fail]]ed attempt to win her affection. As a result, many mixtapes are filled with miserably sappy love songs and things to which no guy within his right mind would listen. They can have other themes as well, such as "Driving music" or "Songs for [[date rape]]."

Since any [[moron]] with a cassette deck can make a mixtape by recording directly from the radio (a primitive form of [[Buffering|streaming media]]) the [[RIAA]] collectively shit their pants, fearing their monopoly on gouging people for records was being threatened. They campaigned against various manufacturers of tape recorders, trying to outlaw the technology in an attempt to keep people from doing what they were going to do anyway. Twenty years later they had the same reaction to [[mp3]]s and achieved similar results: the music industry is powerless to stop anyone determined enough to "steal" music.

==How to make your own mixtape==
There are a couple of well-known methods to create a mixtape, along with [[shit nobody cares about|a few others]]. All are complete wastes of time because the girl you like is dating someone else anyway and [[you]] are a [[fat]] [[basement dwelling]] [[Aspie]].

===The old-fashioned way===
#Connect your tape deck to your radio or another tape deck
#Miss the beginning of the song
#Rewind the tape and try again
#Record for too long, catching the beginning of a song you didn't want
#Rewind too far and fuck up the ending of the previous song
#Repeat the above process until the tape snaps and snarls around the recorder's mechanisms
#Swear profusely and just buy the bitch some flowers

===The modern way===
#[[Soulseek|Pirate]] some [[My Chemical Romance]] songs
#Push the [[random]] button on [[iTunes]] because you're too lazy to put any thought into your playlist
#[[KILL IT WITH FIRE|Burn]] the results to a blank CD
#Label it with [[emo|your own blood]]
#[[Stalk]] the girl you like and [[Stick It In Her Pooper|slip it under her door]]

==Does it really work?==

Contrary to how you may feel, you're not John Cusack and you're not going to win the girl over by pointing your boombox at her in the pouring rain. In fact, if you try that it's quite likely that the [[cops]] will be called and you'll earn yourself a nice new restraining order. As you skulk home in the rain after your talk with the authorities, you may find yourself planning your next mixtape, this time about your impending [[suicide]]. That's how they'll probably find you in the end, lying in a puddle of your own blood, razor blades on the floor, [[goth]] music quietly making its way to the bathroom from your stereo.

What will happen in reality is she's dating some [[faggot]] who listens to the [[Jonas Brothers]] because he's trolling for pussy. You never even stood a chance.

==In case it actually does work==

If you do somehow end up getting a girlfriend with this pathetic cry for attention, it's likely she's some stupid [[scenester]] chick with skunk hair, too much eye makeup, and tacky jewelry. Feel free to show her off at the local [[Hot Topic]], where you will be relentlessly mocked for your choice because you and your girl are not [[hardcore]] enough. Go home and cry about it, because she's [[slut|cheating on you]] with your best friend anyway.
