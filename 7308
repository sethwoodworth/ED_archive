Ever played some kind of [[Halo|video game]] and wondered, [[Fucktard|"could i ever make a spectacular game like this?"]]. We know [[you]] think so. And many [[Retards|people]] just like you have always [[Do not want|wanted]] to [[Nice try|be a little programmer]] and make their own video game [[Shit|masterpiece]]. 

'''Scratch''' is a new and hip [[programming language]] that allows little [[retarded]] children to make their own video game/animation [[Wtf|by adding coloured blocks together]] and sharing their [[Lie|magnificent]] works of art with the [[Internets|world]] by [[Unwarranted self-importance|uploading]] them into [http://scratch.mit.edu/ the Scratch website]. 

The Scratch projects are mostly recognized as a "program suitable for [[Retards|everybody]]", for it's idiotic programming type. Basically, there are lots of coloured [[Shit bricks|blocks]] that each do a different action, and by [[Science|putting those blocks on top of each other]] various [[Hax|scripts]] are obtained. [[Yes|Sounds fucked up?]] It's more like a video game for [[Retards|autistics]], but [[Lie|it's more complicated]].

==Summary==
[[Image:Scratch.JPG|thumb|left|Yeah, something like this.]]

Scratch has been found in somewhere 2007 as a [[Lol|rip-off]] of some program called [[Squeak]], as the [[1337|"Scratch team"]] thought it would be a [[No|good idea]] to turn [[Lego]] into a programming language. At first, seemingly a website for [[13 year old boys|educated programmers]] the website soon turned into a website for [[Fetus|fetuses]]. If you think that this is a program for real programmers, you are [[Doing it wrong|wrong]]. Every single [[Trying too hard|project]] is always the [[Furry|"Scratch Cat"]] spinning either clockwise or counter-clockwise, since the little retards can't program for [[shit]] even when using blocks, and yet it will be the [[This|top-rated]] project of all time in the website.

As of now, there are about 550 thousand projects. [[None|The best ones]] get to be [[Hookers and blow|featured]], as in, get to be on the front page, but since all of them are fucking [[shit]], it doesn't mean anything much. Amongst the members, there is also a rating system, called [[Digg|love-its]], and, as a result, most of the projects will be captioned by the author [[Nice try|"5 love-its and a sequel"]]. Unfortunetaly, [[Duh|love-its do not give you money]], and the [[crap|crappy]] projects will remain crappy, and they will not even give you [[profit]].

==Projects==
[[Image:Scratch2.JPG|right|thumb|[[Typical]] [[shit|project]] by a [[16 year old girl]] who [[Katy|thinks saying "waffles" is funny]].]] 

As mentioned, the [[Nothing|variety]] of the projects on Scratch is not big. There are five categories of the games/animations on Scratch, ranging from [[Lie|complicated scripts]] to [[Fail|a sound of a guitar string]].

# The shit projects, [[99%]] of them include a [[Too lazy|pre-drawn]] background, a two sentence dialoge and the [[DO IT FAGGOT|ever-smiling]] Scratch Cat. Most of these projects are made by some random people from [[Latvia]]. No, these projects not even playable. Most of the [[None|real]] programmers [[RAGE|rage]] over this kind of projects, but the author's excuse is always [[Nice try|"it's my first project, why u so mean"]]. [http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/selgomez123/698582 Example]
# The static projects, either includes a picture of a [[furry]] drawn by a [[furry]] author, or some "recolouring" shit. [[Always]] gets comments how [[kawaii]] the project is. [http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/selgomez123/698582 Example]
# The two-script projects, the [[OMG|actually playable]] ones, but they still have only [[No more than 99|about two]] scripts, and usually ask [[Wow|to click the arrow keys]] and acquire [[Fart|different sounds]]. [http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/LWSrocks/399932 Example]
# The so-called "not bad" projects, still [[RAGE|fucking crap]], but better than the other ones. [http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/selgomez123/698582 Example]
# The good projects. Sadly, none of this category has been found to this date.

There is also a [[Copypasta|"remixing"]] feature. Remixes are Type 4 projects that are downloaded, [[Trying too hard|edited]] and uploaded again. Remixes are somewhat called [[The cancer that is killing /b/|"The AIDS that is killing Scratch"]] by the [[1337]] Scratch [[Oldfag|oldfags]], since the website is now full of those [[Crap|turds]], but the website is full of [[AIDS]] anyway, so it doesn't have a point.

=="Programmers"==
[[Image:1337_h4xx0rz.gif|thumb|left|Typical "Scratcher"]]

To be [[Liar|fair]], there are some [[No|good]] projects in the website, if by good you mean [[Fail|guiding a ball through a maze]]. But all of those [[Lie|not bad]] projacts are made by one person, [[Wat|Paddle2See]] (who is [[Fail|from the Scratch Development Team]]). The other [[No more than 99|350 thousand]] members are [[Asperger's syndrome|assburger-infested]] 8 year olds that have been told being [[Autistic|artistic]]. The program is also [[Advertising|advertised]] as being [[What-EVER|"a great program for education"]], but what kind of education could a [[retard]] give/get?

Other than some [[Asperger's syndrome|aspies]], there are shitloads of [[16 year old girls]] that upload their [[Kawaii]] furry drawings. [[99%|Most]] of them have their own [[Dumbass|idiotic]] [[Fursona|Scratch-sona's]], either it's a [[Furry|gray polar bear]] or a [[Furry|bowling ball with a nose]], and they use them in their shitty games. This makes all of the [[Nice try|real programmers]] rage, [[Gb2kitchen|and, as a result, they remind the retarded whores of their best-fitting spot]].

[[Impossible|Even worse than the projects.]]

==Trolls==
Starting in early 2009, a [[Yes|troll problem built up on scratch]]. [[Lie|Scratch, believe it or not, had an era of free speech]]. This was ruined when [[Retards|Lightnin and Paddle2See]] discovered a handy dandy tool called fascism, [[Nazi|instantly banning half of scratch]]. The [[Retards|survivors]] were plunged into a state of [[Idiocy|perpetual happiness]] and thrived, [[Lie|making some of the best games to dwell the internet]]. [[Win|This lasted until on a scratch forum full of banned folk, Lord Sprites, a secret group formed, and attacked scratch with free speech at midnight, saying unbelievable things such as]] [[Truth|"scratch sucks" and "this site has a worse case of cancer than /b/"]]. [[Win|Plunged into a state of fear, Lightnin and Paddle2See added even more fascism]]. [[Win|Unhappy with the result, the trolling group, in early June, attacked the site with meatspin and goatse]]. [[Lie|This being the first time scratch was ever trolled in this method]], [[Win|the community was shocked and images were disabled]]. Then, the "New Scratcher" rule was added, [[Win|turning all scratchers that had never posted on the forums into slaves unable to post images or practically anything]]. [[Lie|This obviously crippled the troll group,]] [[No|making them unable to troll]]. [[Fail|So, they formed a webcomic, which was good at first, until it got cancer, too]]. It updates every two seconds and has [[Over 9000|370+]] comics, [[Truth|and some early ones are very funny]], but too many new members were let in, including several [[Retards|scratchers]], producing shit comics. [[Lie|However, some later comics are half decent]].
Among the [[Over 9000|370+]] comics, there are some noteworthy ones.

* 2. Act like a [[wapanese|Weaboo]] or [[furfag|Furry]].
* 3. Make a project.
* 4. Continue to act nice until promoted to "Scratcher".
* 5. Post [[goatse]] and [[meatspin]] everywhere.
* 6. [[???]]
* 7. [[win|Profit!]]
