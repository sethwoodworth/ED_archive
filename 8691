Unlimited disposable income
A [[catchphrase]] originally coined by [[mediacrat]] in his [[mediacrat voicemails]] left for [[jameth]]. It was subsequently memorialized in the [[mediacrat|Ballad of J]]. To possess unlimited disposable income basically means to have enough [[Jew gold]]s to ruin anyone who opposes you and withstand anything the Internets can throw at you.

[[Zenofeller]] is known to have unlimited disposable [[bandwidth]].


If [[you]] have unlimited disposable income, why don't you go ahead and donate? Cheap-ass.

In case you couldn't tell from the periodic asking for monies, like the one right above this sentence, ED does not have unlimited disposable income.
