TMBW;DR
A variant of [[tl;dr]], this occurs when [[brainlesswonder]] spams the messageboard - often in a short-lived period of lucidity - in such a manner that it effectively prevents actual engagement of the topic. 

The threads caused by resulting drama, dumb comments, derailing, and his inability to shut-up can often prove daunting to the [[Liberal]], or [[Debate]] regular, let alone [[newbie]].
