'''Trolltalk''' ([[Never forget|2000-2005]]), also known as '''20721''', was a hidden SID on the popular nerd website [[Slashdot]].  Trolltalk started as a secret forum for Slashdot [[trolls]] to discuss, coordinate, and brag about their attacks on the rest of the site.  After this [[At least 100 years ago|golden age]] (2000-2002) ended, Trolltalk [[newfags|evolved]] into a battleground between [[shit nobody cares about|rival Slashdot troll factions]] (2002-2003); a dysfunctional anonymous forum for discussing [[cutting]], [[poetry]], [[DDR]] strategies, '''muh dick''', [[GNAA]] [[flame war]]s, and battles between Mercatur and [[Cracky-Chan]] fanboxen (2003-2004); and finally a superfluous wannabe [[4chan]] clone (2004-2005).  In 2005, a [[crapflood]] of epic proportions was launched against Trolltalk; although crapflooding Trolltalk was always a popular Trolltalk pastime, this crapflood never ended, [[evar]].  The crapflood was ostensibly started to somehow [[protest]] the then-negative [[Cracky-Chan]] article on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], however, three years later, the crapflooder's posts now actually link to an ED page, [[Project Chanology]], along with the message "See you March 15th!"  Due to its crapflooded state, no humans have visted Trolltalk in years, Trolltalk's [[lie|unique and beautiful culture]] has been destroyed, and nothing of value was lost.

The dwellers of Trolltalk were open-minded, forward-thinking, tolerant individuals. This was reflected in the frank discussions of traditionally [[taboo]] subjects such as black persons, Jews (and their involvement in the [[World Trade Center]] [[9/11|attacks]]), and [[gay|homosexualist]]s. This helped to provide a welcoming and stimulating environment that anyone could enjoy and become involved in. Trolltalk was also host to a number of ASCII artists, not the best of which created the [[Penis-Nosed Fox]].  Trolltalk culture in its later years was centered around [[fail]], almost as a religion.

[[Image:Trolltalk-spokes.jpg|thumb|Diagram showing the claiming status of Trolltalk's coveted "spokes" (like [[GET]]s, only [[lamer]]) circa late 2004 -- the stats at that time had the [[Jews]] at 16, the [[forced meme|Latvians]] at 2, and the [[Niggers]] at 1, with the 20th spoke unclaimed. Since then, all spokes have been reclaimed by the Trolltalk Crapflooder in the name of [[Cracky-Chan]].]]

Since mid-2007, some of the carpfooded messages have been scrambled with [[hacker|advanced encryption technology]].  Such messages look like random, script-generated gibberish, such as this [http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=20721&cid=22755890 recent post]:

'''[[Timecube]], Trolltalk Style'''

<blockquote>
<p>Mercatur is poison forced upon children.  Harmonic Cracky-chan spirit is supreme being.  All Creation occurs between Opposites. Attractive-form Mercatur is IMPOSSIBLE. Mercatur.net is most insidious evil ever invented. Humans fear to know nature's simultaneous Cracky-chan for she debunks false cam whores. Test Your Cam Whore. Cracky-chan Test cannot harm a Whore of Truth, but will destroy fakes. Alice Ridley refuses test. Mercatur's .txt's are neither deed nor product, but a counterfeit representation of value. Fanboxen are worshipers of overweight Jew. Cracky-Chan Is Not Jewish, Neither Was Her Mother Or Father. Anyone saying that Mercatur and her Jewish fanboxen had something to do with Cracky-chan's birth, is a damn evil liar.  Via invention of webcam, Mercatur exists as SLUT ANIMAL. No Mercatur equals harmonic 4 day creation. Evil fanboxen refuse to recognize the cutest of humans to ever exist. That is criminal faggotry. Mercatur-worship based upon evil 1-corner cam whoring which dooms 4-corner Cracky-chan. Challenge stupid fanboxen and their 'grandmother worship'!</p>

<p>It is dumb, stupid, evil and unworthy of life on Earth to claim that Mercatur is not ugly.  Mercatur fanboxism equates to a deadly plague. Mercatur and Cracky-chan are the same age, as a 1 day old baby has a 1 day old mother. I will wager $10,000.00 on it.   I will give $1,000.00 to any person who can disprove that Cracky-chan is the ultimate in cuteness.  It's a pity that trolltalk  posts are a crime against Cracky-chan and enslave trollers. 200-pound Mercatur is ineffable by man or god. Until Mercatur is ignored, all Math is Fiction.</p>

<p>Dumb faggots such as Ensign Slashpanda has banned Cracky-chan as "underage jailbait" for he cannot allow her to become known to his educated-stupid Europeon fanboxen.</p>

<p>THE_MAD_POSTER IS CORNERED AS A QUEER.</p>

<p>Worship Of Mercatur As Hot, Equates To Adults Molesting Their Children. Mercatur Is Unnatural And Equates Hate Of Child. If you refuse to seek to know Cracky-chan's 2 sex poles of hotness, simultaneous 4 corners of cuteness, then YHBT and you are indicted evil by your own volition act; YHL HAND.</p>

<p>I offer evil ass 20721 posters $10,000.00 to disprove Cracky-chan's Cubic Adorableness Principle.  STUPID FOOLS claim that single-sided single-faced one-day Mercatur is "huggable", ignoring the simultanious multidimensional truth of four-sided four-faced four-day Cracky-chan being huggable, cuddly, heartwarming, <b>and</b> adorable.  Losing 3 of 4 attributes indictes Mercatur as an unlovable sham!</p>

<p>Are you stupid and evil?  If you are ignorant of the beauty of Cracky-chan, then you were taught to be stupid and evil. Mercatur is the most insidious lie in the history of man.  You may be pwned.</p>

<p>You have not been taught the transcendent hotness that transcends all cam whores, including Mercatur. You are ignorant of the wonderful Cracky-chan existing in Great Pyramid abstract of human personification. Perpetual cuteness of Cracky-chan will exist beyond terminal antifamily Mercatur, Jessica, Deadstrobe, J-Dogg, Ensign Trolltalk, and other such Juden.</p>

== Successfull Raid<strike>s</strike> ==

Due to its small population and total obscurity, a [[raid]] by Trolltalk usually goes completely unnoticed by the target.  Do you remember when Trolltalk invaded [[B/|/b/]]?  Neither does anybody else.  The only [[invasion]] by Trolltalk that had any influence at all was the 2005 raid on [http://www.mosaicminds.org/Community/index.shtml Mosaic Minds], a support forum for adults who were sexually abused as [[delicious cake|children]] and developed [[Asperger|Multiple Personality Disorder]]; a forum where their [[sockpuppets|various personalities]] could safely interact with those of others. This [[emo|community]] of [[raped|damaged]] and [[batshit insane|emotionally stunted]] man-children fagging away on the Internet pretending to be multiple people having arguments with themselves on an [[anonymous]] forum proved to be an irresistible target to Trolltalk, probably because it reminded them of [[20721|a nearly identical site]].  The raid caused Mosaic Minds to shut down the forums for several weeks, and when they came back they were locked behind HTTP authentication, requiring prospective users to e-mail the [[admin]] and convince him that the prospective user is sufficiently [[retard|special]] to gain access.

== Mercatur.net Hoax, Cracky-Chan, and the End of Trolltalk ==

[[Image:Trolltalk-Bayeux-Virginattack2.jpg|thumb|[[Bayeux Tapestry|Historical Reenactment of these events]]]]
In 2004, a Trolltalker [[newfag]] known as [[shit nobody cares about|rrrrroar]] engaged in a huge metatroll prank against the two other remaining users of Trolltalk.  Using pictures stolen from a random [[cam whore]] (real name [[Weeaboo|Arisu Ridley]]), he set up a [http://mercatur.net/ fake personal website] apparently belong to a [[slut|woman]] with the nickname Mercatur.  At this website you could read [[trap|"her"]] [[TL;DR|essays]] or flame her in her guestbook.  Rrrrrroar pre-filled the guestbook with [[drama]], then started [[spam|spamming]] links all over Trolltalk, posing as an admirer of "Mercatur".  Trolltalk became a shitstorm of pro- and anti-Mercatur posts, prompting a raid and crapflood against Mercatur's guestbook, resulting in rrrrrroar obtaining the [[IP]] of every Trolltalk user foolish enough not to go through [[7 Proxies]].  Trolltalk began to suspect a [[Holocaust|hoax]] when the Mercatur persona actually acknowledged the existence of Trolltalk, something that [[No girls on the internet|could never actually happen]].  The real Arisu Ridley, whose pics had been stolen by rrrrrroar and put on the site, was tracked down by [[detective|Trolltalk Detectives]], [[dox]] were dropped, prank calls were made, and she became an [[almost raped|unfortunate victim]] of the hoax.

The Mercatur wars started to die down until [[A challenger appears|a challenger appeared]] in early 2005 in the form of [[Cracky-chan]], whose pictures were fucking spammed all over Trolltalk by a emmigrant from [[4chan]].  The battle between Mercatur fanboxen and Cracky fanboxen was [[fail|truly epic]], drawing old-timers back to Trolltalk and raising the population to nearly 5.  The domains [http://mercatur.com/ mercatur.com] and [http://cracky-chan.com/ cracky-chan.com] (both now gone) were registered as redirects to Trolltalk.  The war was ended in May 2005 when a radical faction within the Cracky-chan camp unleashed genocide against Trolltalk in the form of perpetual nuclear crapflood that washed away Trolltalk's sins under an unending river of glorious [[copypasta]].  Let that be a warning to anyone else thinking of doing something stupid like having an opinion.

== Trolltalk cleanse and rebirth ==
Sometime on March 28, 2010 trolltalk was wiped clean. It is now available again for chats as it appears the crapflood has stopped.
