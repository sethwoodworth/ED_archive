OS/2

A lot of people like '''OS/2'''.  In fact, some people like OS/2 so much, they wish they could have sex with it.  This is because the majority of OS/2 users are bankers who can't get laid otherwise.  You should never make fun of OS/2, unless you want your money to "magically" disappear from your bank account.

The only people who are allowed to make fun of OS/2 are [[Microsoft]] employees.  [[IBM]] ''would'' make fun of OS/2, but they are trying too hard to forget about it.
