Soup, /b/.

So I got into a fight today at Wal-Mart.

I was standing at the magazine rack, [[theft|pulling the discs out of OXM outer wraps]]...basically just minding my own business...and then some kid wearing a [[Soulja Boy]] shirt stepped to me [[verbose|quite improper]]

first off, he [[bump|bumped me]].

<nowiki>:|</nowiki>

second off, he flipped the edge of the OXM I was pilfering, in a threatening way as he passed, and then goes... [[PS3]].. [[fag|fayg]].

i was like...'yeah, I'm brand neutral but you don't need to inform me that you [[gay|suck off]] your friends [[slut|for free]], because that's already obvious. thanks for bumping into me though, dickface'

actually i only got to the 'friends for free' part and he was [[NO U|all up in my face]], grabbing the magazine out of my hand and telling me how his older brother was gonna kick my ass.

i DID think of the rest later on though

now, normally i try to [[faggot|avoid violence]] - [[bullshit|mostly because my awesome Puerto-Rican Judo and Brazilian Jujitsu skills must be kept in check, or they could cause serious damage.]] [[mary sue|if i punch the ground hard enough, I'm pretty sure i could split the world in half]]...or at least knock some stuff off a table nearby.

but this kid was [[asking for it]], so i lulled him into a [[trap|false sense of security]] by apologizing and assuring him that i would procure an ice cream cone of any [[dat ass|flavor he chose]], as a peace offering. this seemed to [[lolwut|confuse him]], but make him cautiously optimistic about the situation, which is when i chose to deliver a [[Dynamic Entry|jumping front kick to his throat]], knocking him back several feet into the Young Miss section where he got tangled up in a Bratz bed canopy and then lurched sideways into rack of Stussy activewear...[[just as planned|JUST AS I HAD PLANNED!]]

since he was incapacitated, i reached behind me for something large and heavy to pound his face with.. but it was all sheet sets, bedspreads, duvet covers and such...when i turned back around he was already back in my face and he had a [[abortion|hanger in his hand.]] i managed to block the first shot with my left arm, but when i tried to counter with a right jab, he got me in the ribs with the end of the hanger and dropped me to one knee....which left me open to [[OH SHI-|vicious and repeated face kicks]], followed by a Garmin [[GPS]] display unit to the head.

at this point i really needed to even things up so i went for the double [[banhammer|hammer fist to the nuts]]....a staple move from the knees...[[cliche]] really - but i admit i was [[attention whore|desperate]]. i wasn't gonna let a punk in a soulja boy shirt beat up an awesome American like me, [[patriot|wearing American flag shorts]], a [[in the kitchen|wife beater]], flip flops, mirrored sunglasses and rocking a sweet dragon [[wigger|chain around my neck.]]

the second i made contact, he grunted and crumpled to the ground like a sack of wet grass.

for a moment or two i considered continuing the pounding to get even [[MOAR|MORE]] even, but then a Wal-Mart employee (surprisingly!) showed up and asked if anything was wrong.

i looked at her, then back down at soulja punk and said "no, nothing's wrong. but could you do me a favor?"

she said '[[no]]' and [[customers suck|turned around to walk away]], unconcerned that an unconscious person was laying in the aisle surrounded by defaced Wally World merchandise...but i [[imaginary|pretended]] like she said '[[yes]]' and stayed to listen, so i could [[cum|make my exit the proper way.]]

i turned back to the crumpled [[loser]] who was starting to rouse from his coma of nut pain and said triumphantly as i stepped over him "I need a price check...." then stopped to push him back to the ground with my foot as i continued "...on bitches."

wrote the OXM discs off and left through the outdoor gardening area exit [[feels good man|feeling like i had just made the world a better place...because i had.]]
