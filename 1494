The Child Abduction meme was started on the 4th of May 2007, and it is generally a picture of [[Futurama|Bender]] from the show ''[[Futurama]]'' with the words "Child Abduction" written on it, making it appear as though he is a [[pedophile]].

==Originality==
Child Abduction meme was originally started when a [[4chan|4chon]] [[weeaboo]] started a cancerous thread on /b/ asking people to help him fix his real life television. His television would show the caption "CHILD ABDUCTION" on the top right of his screen, so he turned to [[B/|/b/]] for [[troll|wisdom and guidance]].

==Amber Alerts==
The caption on his television was actually an Amber alert. Amber Alerts are <s>[[Awesome|distributed via commercial radio stations, satellite radio, television stations, and cable TV by the Emergency Alert System, as well as via e-mail, electronic traffic-condition signs, and wireless device SMS text messages.]][[fail|</s>]] [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]] It is comforting to know that citizens of the interwebs can take joy from a child being abducted.

==So it Begins==
Shortly after discovering that it was an Amber Alert, [[B/|/b/tards]] started postings suggestions such as [[gtfo|"change the channel" or "turn the television on and off."]] After many unsuccessful attempts, more images were posted from the Original Poster regarding the caption. The photos were taken in a dark room with a low resolution web camera.

The caption itself reading "Child Abduction" was considered as a great humorous news caption to have on a television set, so it was quickly picked up by other members and posted on several images.

== Bender? ==
One image in particular which was taken from the original poster's camera had a picture of [[Futurama|Bender]] with the Child Abduction caption placed perfectly on top of his [[dildo|antenna]]. This quickly led other [[B/|/b/tards]] to place the caption on as many Bender pictures they could find.
