USB line
'''USB line''' is an [[at least 100|Old School]] meme from the now defunct 420chan.net that addresses the interaction of a [[computer]] with...

...I'll show you later.

[[Image:1190622466891.jpg|thumb|The correct way to use a USB line is to insert down the urethra.]]
The phrase originates from a [[CP]] video (CP was pretty much the only thing posted on 420chan.net) in which the 5 year old [[loli|subject]] asked "How do you get these pictures on the...the...com-pooter?" The man informed her that "It's called a USB line, I'll show you later" because he just wanted her to go back to [[masturbating]].
