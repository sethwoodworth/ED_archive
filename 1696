Command line
In the beginning, there was the command line. The command line is for [[1337]] computer users only. Using the command line lets do you some things that might not be possible from within your operating system's [[GUI]]. At the same time, most tasks on the command line are much more difficult to do compared to their [[GUI]] alternatives. Remember, the more pointless the use of command line, the greater the expansion of [[epenis|e-pen0r]].

The command line essentially serves two major purposes. The first is to give [[Lunix]] users a sense of superiority. Secondly, since [[Open Source|Open-Sores]] window managers provide almost no functionality, it allows Lunix users to attempt (and usually fail) to get things done.

==Using the Command Line to Fix A PC==
If you should find yourself at a [[UNIX]] or [[Lunix]] terminal and don't know how to get things done, you can solve most problems by doing the following:
#In the command line, type 'rm -rf /*' without the quotes
#Locate a Windows XP CD, run the installer, making sure to reformat the drive so the viral Lunix stuff doesn't survive.
:*If the computer is a Mac running Lunix: You're fucking screwed. [[KILL IT WITH FIRE]] or buy a new machine.
#Success! You can now actually [[Porn|get things done]]!
#[[Profit|Profit!]]
