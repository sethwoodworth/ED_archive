Featured article
[[Image:Reese Witherspoon 2005.jpg|thumb|Chosen as a featured article because of her [[Aryan]] looks, this was the work of a clique cabal of [[BNP|white pride]] editors who managed to escape the detection of [[the Wikipedia Jews]].]]

'''Featured articles''' (also known as [[FA]]s) are [[Wikipedia]]'s version of ED's [[ED:AOTN|Article of the Now]], which means they get displayed on the main page for a day as they represent TOW's [[bullshit|finest work]]. Currently, at the moment, there are [[less than 9000]] featured articles because [[Wikipedophile]]s tend to be very [[anal|strict]] about the high [[desperate|standards]] that Wikipedia should maintain.

Most featured [[article]]s have not actually been on Wikipedia's main page, despite [[popular belief]]. This is because there are teams of [[slave]]s to the wiki with the ability to write quality material, but absolutely no ability to [[deep thinker|think for themselves]], and an endless capacity to suck [[cock]]. There exist featured articles on a wide variety of subjects; despite this, most of them are on topics that are [[unfunny]] and generate absolutely no [[lulz]], with a mass of featured articles about inane [[fanboi|fancruft]] and articles about [[shit bands]] that [[nobody cares]] about, as well as historical [[holocaust|events]] and [[Anne Frank|people]] that were forgotten by normal people [[at least 100 years ago]].

==[[Moar]] about featured articles==
There is a featured article on [[porn]]star Jenna Jameson (written by a pervert called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AnonEMouse AnonEMouse] who along with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Epbr123 Epbr123] are the resident Wikipedia porn addicts), however it will never be going on the main page to [[Chris Hansen|protect the kiddies]] from the evil Wikipedophiles who are educating them about something their parents wouldn't tell them about, or [[mundane|even know about]], in accordance with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CHILD WP:CHILD], which the user [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SqueakBox SqueakBox], founder of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PAW Pedophilia Article Watch WikiProject], approves of.

Like its [[inbred]] cousin the [[good article]] there are [[lie|rigorous quality standards]] which any featured article must adhere to. When an editor wants to get an advantage over other editors, he goes to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAC featured article candidates page] and asks whether other people want the article to be promoted. It's nothing to do with the quality of the article whether it will be promoted and have the little golden star in the top right corner - it's purely based on whether the editors involved like the subject matter or not. This makes a [[lulz|mockery]] of Wikipedia's ideas about consensus and [[Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines|all the other crap they made up and tried to impose on the rest of the internet]].

[[Grawp]] has regularly attacked the featured article with his HAGGER?????????????????????????? [[vandalism]]. He has also made [[Anonymous]] his [[personal army]], and successfully gets the featured article of the day semi-protected (look at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Cross&limit=500&action=history revision history] for their [[commonwealth|Victoria Cross]] article). As [[Smugfag]] stated in his 17-minute ego trip rant against Anonymous in March 2008, it's not that difficult to get anons, especially 4chan [[newfags]], to blindly follow you like a [[sheep]], making his comparison of Anonymous to the Co$ actually a valid point in some ways because they're both [[awesome|dangerous]] [[cult]]s, although he's certainly not the first person to have thought of that.

Featured articles are [[Rule 34|without exception]] extremely [[TL;DR]]. A form of [[cancer]] on [[4chan|niggertits]] is people making threads about the featured article, and the picture that accompanies it (if there is a picture - [[copyright|fair use]] images cannot be on the main page because [[ALL CAPS|WIKIPEDIA IS THE MOST ANAL, STRICT, HEAD UP ITS OWN FUCKING RECTUM]] website [[OTI]] and the faggots controlling its content are [[over 9000]] times moar butthurt and paranoid than 99% of sane internet users are). For example, someone made a thread about the FA [[celebrity|Reese Witherspoon]] on /[[b]]/ [[last Thursday]], and asked [[I'd hit it|whether anons would "hit it"]]. Obviously not [[Original Content|original content]], and the obvious answer is going to be [[hawt|yes]] for almost all /b/tards, thus it is cancer, but cancer of the "cute, thirtysomething woman that you'd probably want to fuck" variety.

==Lulzworthy featured articles==

[[Image:FAstar.jpg|thumb|left|The seal of approval for all featured content, and something that Wikipedos [[fap]] to every day. There is even a featured sounds page, which is both bizarre and ripe for [[trolling]] because no one ever watches it. Another FA-related process is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAR featured article review], which could be trolled successfully with a smart mind and an army of [[sockpuppet]]s, [[pwning]] TOW by cracking splinters into the number of featured articles they have.]]

[[Image:4chanfaWP.jpg|right|thumb|Wikipedia has featured 4chan. Next up to get [[Encyclopaedia Dramatica]] featured.]]

*The [[Virginia Tech Massacre]]. This FA was on the main page on April 16, 2008, to celebrate the [[an hero day|anniversary]] of the shootings. On the [[talk page]], a [[butthurt]] Wikipedo starts [[BAWWWWW]]ing about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Virginia_Tech_massacre#Featured_Article the possibility that having this as a featured article might encourage similar shootings in the future], something which would create [[lulz]] and [[drama]]. The [[faggot]] however failed to realize that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ENC WIKIPEDIA IS NOT CENSORED], a common motto of [[internet tough guy]]s patrolling the dark alleyways of the wiki.

*A ''[[South Park]]'' episode satirizing [[Scientology]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_in_the_Closet_%28South_Park%29 This] was on the main page on March 15, 2008, both the birthday of [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and the organization of [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY|protests against Scientology worldwide]] by [[moralfag]]s. Any coincidences here?

*There was an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Uncyclopedia/archive1 attempt] to get [[Uncyclopedia]] to featured article status. However, it failed, and it remains at [[good article]] status. This failure is a good thing, seeing Uncyclopedia [[asspie]]s collectively reach unprecedented levels of [[butthurt]].

*[[4chan]] on was featured on January 14 2009. This resulted in posters on [[/b/]] to vandalize the article leading to semi-protection and [[butthurt]] on the [[Administrators' noticeboard]]. Also there was an attempt to scare [[newfags]] who would be visiting 4chan on that day.

==Conclusion==
Wikipedia began as a [[nerd]]'s dream, but now it is apparent to everyone that it has [[fail]]ed to be what people wanted it to be. The featured article process is more corrupt than a [[Borat|Kazakh]] police officer being offered a bribe of [[300]] U.S. dollars to let you get away with a [[jail|crime]], because the final decision is made by an [[fat|overweight]] [[wop]] known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Raul654 Raul654]. It's embarrassing to watch the internal bickering between the morons at the [[sysop|administrator]]'s [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AN/I noticeboard], which is a lulzworthy thing to read from time to time, watching admins get [[butthurt]] whenever an [[13-year-old boy|anon-IP]] [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-haciendathreat19apr19,0,2049116.story makes an edit about carrying out] a [[school shooting]] in some shithole town in the [[USA]]. It's embarrassing to read their [[pretentious]], bullshit articles full of lies, pedantry and [[faggotry]]. Wikipedia is overall an epic failure and readers here are encouraged to boycott it and vandalize it as much as possible in the most annoying way possible (see [[Grawp]] for instructions). It's no wonder that [[MONGO|established users]] are choosing to leave, even if they've written a shitload of featured articles.

ED, on the other hand, is actually both fun to contribute to and to read, and doesn't make you [[facepalm|cringe]] at the fact that Wikipedia is epically [[trying too hard]]. [[ED:AOTN|Featured articles on ED]] are topical, relevant, and lulzworthy, usually containing much drama. They are usually worth reading, because they won't [[TL;DR|bore you]] to [[death]]. And unlike Wikipedia, most importantly, ED does have a sense of [[humor]], and can take a joke or an [[ad hominem]] insult without being [[offended]] like Wikipedos always are when something they don't agree with [[BLP|happens]].
