[[Image:Harlan_ellison1.jpg|thumb|An exerpt from Harlan's everyday life.]]
In a world where people pay [[Over_9000|thousands]] of dollars to submit themselves to black person labor, [[conspiracy|brainwashing]] and [[rape|group therapy]], its no surprise anyone that can write star trek [[fanfiction]] can rise over the general [[retard|sci fi community]].

'''Harlan Ellison''' (AKA [[Harbl|Harblan]], [[Hubbard|L Ron's]] [[buttsecks|buttbuddy]], or [[That fucking cat|that fucking midget]]) is a [[jewish]] [[science fiction]] writer of [[poor|meager]] success that achieved [[IRL]] and [[Internets|E-fame]] for writing [[Over 9000|over 1000]] [[Shit Nobody Cares About|short stories, novellas, screenplays, teleplays, essays]] and criticising [[everything|anyone]] that achieved more [[jewgold|success]] than he did. He's even more famous, though, due to his [[emo|whiny]], [[failed]] attempts at sounding [[serious business|serious]] and overall being full of [[shit]].

Harlan is also known for fagging it up on [[youtube|jewtube]] and having a small legion of [[retard|fans]] on it and quoting himself on his website (see below). 


==Biography==
[[Image:bat_country.jpg|thumb|[[Bel Air|You're moving back with auntie and uncle in Cleveland]] ]]
[[Image:Harlan1.jpg|thumb|Harlan, seen here with his mom.]]

[[Harbl|Harblan]] Ellison was born [[at least 100]] years ago in Cleveland, Ohio from [[Jewish]] parents (which actually explains a lot). They moved to Painesville some time later, but returned to Cleveland once again following the [[pwn|death]] of his father and because they couldn't stop there.

As he grew up, Harlan ran away from home several times because his [[whore|widow]] mom wouldn't buy him a [[Wii|nes]] and proceeded to take on a wide variety of [[blowjob|odd jobs]], from [[Lolwut|dynamite truck driver]] to being a [[prostitute|hired gun]] for a [[Jameth|rich, insane man]]. Of course, these [[lies|claims]] are [[dubious disclaimer|dubious]] at best. Its more than [[obvious]] that this [[midget]] is just a walking, [[Jenkem|reeking can of fail]] [[desperate]] for some [[attention whore|attention]].

Later on he'd join local university, were he'd stay for 18 months before being [[b&|expelled]]. He [[lies|claims]] it was for  going [[batshit insane]] and hitting a professor for [[Lol|lolling]] at his [[fail|writing skills]], but it was really because he [[retard|couldn't keep up]] to the [[win|university's standards]]. For the next forty or so years, he's send to said teacher a copy of every one of his works out of sheer [[raeg]], but mostly because he had [[you don't have any friends|nothing better to do]].
 
Harley would later move to [[New York]] to achieve [[unrealistic expectations|great success as a science fiction writer]], ending up publishing [[at least 100|more than 100]] short stories and articles [[HAHAHA OH WOW|over a period of 2 years]]. In an unsurprising twist, Harly also wrote several [[pr0n|erotic stories]], including the ironically named [[HAHAHA|"God Bless the Ugly Virgin"]], in which he depicts his own [[nothing|sexual life]], which was later published in a [[softpaw magazine|gay magazine]] in [[LA]] under the pseudonym [[What|Cordwainer Bird]].  

During that time, Harlan married some [[your mom|bitch]], divorcing her some months later because the effects of the [[drugs]] he had given her had finally worn off and she realized she had married an [[ugly]] [[midget]] who [[unemployed|didn't have a real job]] and was unable to do [[list of sex moves|anything marginally pleasurable]] in bed. After that, he'd start writing about [[13 year old boy|youth gangs]], and even join one in order to [[rape|get closer]] to its members. Did I mention they nicknamed him [[gay|"Cheech Beldone"]]?

After having lots of [[buttsecks|great times]] following [[children]] through the streets of New York, Harlan go drafted into the [[army]], in which he [[bitch|served]] for 2 years and got back to NY to write for [[shit nobody cares about|rogue magazine]].

Today Harley mostly occupies himself with filling [[internet court|internet lawsuits]] against pretty much anything and everything, writing articles on his pseudo-[[blog]], and fagging it up on the [[jewtube]].

==Personality==

As we would expect from the [[fugly]], unholy spawn of a Jew [[your mom|mother]], Harlan's got a personality that could be described as [[faggotry|frivolous]], Jew and [[haet|abrasive]]. In one of his books, he even declares himself as [[Unwarranted self importance|"possibly the most contentious person on Earth"]]. 

{{quote|"Harlan uses his [[nothing|gifts]] for [[gay|colorful]] and [[what|variegated invective]] on those who [[troll|irritate]] him â€” [[retards|intrusive fans]], Jew, callous publishers, [[troll|offensive strangers]]."|Isaac Asimov| [[BFF]] }}

==The L. Ron Connection==

[[Image:Lronmadden.jpg|thumb|Is it me, or do all old sci fi writers have a penchant for [[bullshit]]?]]
[[fact|It are fact]] that Harlan and [[Hubbard|L. Ron]] have [[BFF|known each other]] and [[buttsecks|shared ideas]] for a long time, though it seems their relationship [[fail|dwindled]] after L. Ron achieved [[portal|huge success]] after having dropped the [[science fiction]] moniker and turned all his crappy work into another [[religion|kind of fiction]]. While this doesn't make L. Ron any better than his shorter counterpart, he died due to [[massive damage|massive consumption]] of [[hookers and blow]], while Harlan is heading towards a [[dying alone|considerably bleaker fate]].

With that [[emo|sinking feeling]] in his heart, Harlan decided to reveal the real genesis of [[Scientology]] to all of our marvelous [[series of tubes|serial tubular structure]], in an interview with [[Unfunny|Robin Williams]].

This vid contributed to the mix of [[epic win]] and [[fail|massive fail]] that [[chanology]] was.

{{quote|Scientology is bullshit! Man, I was there the night L. Ron Hubbard invented it, for Christ's sakes! (...) We were sitting around one night... who else was there? Alfred Bester, and Cyril Kornbluth, and Lester del Rey, and Ron Hubbard, who was making a penny a word, and had been for years. And he said "This bullshit's got to stop!" He says, "I gotta get money." He says, "I want to get rich". And somebody said, "why don't you invent a new religion? They're always big." We were clowning! You know, "Become Elmer Gantry! You'll make a fortune!" He says, "I'm going to do it." |Harlan Ellison| speaking the [[truth]], for a change. }}

==[[IRL]] Fail==

Harlan is also known for [[trolling IRL]]. He, however, unlike the able [[dramacrats]] we know and love, is unable to do so and achieve [[win]] without causing him to look like a sad pile of [[fail]]. Only the most remarkable ones will be listed here, because there is just too much [[shit]] in this guy's [[adult baby|diaper]].



'''The Connie Willis Incident:'''
[[Image:Harlantitgrab.jpg|thumb|Excuse me, [[wtf]] are u doin?]]

While receiving another sci fi award [[nobody gives a shit|no one cares about]], Harlan gazed upon Connie's delicious [[DO NOT WANT|rugged breasts]], and decided to [[rape|get a piece]] for that night's [[fap|fapping]] session.

Connie was [[DO NOT WANT|not amused]].

'''The Infamous Jellybean Incident:'''


From [[Shii]]'s own words:
[[Image:Harlanvictim.jpg|thumb|Since no caption of the poor, [[insane]] girl is known to exist, here's a illustrative pic of Harlan and some [[whore]].]]

''"At a con in the [[old media|mid-80's]], Harlan encountered something rare in his book: [[hawt|an extremely attractive]], [[tits|big-busted]], [[win|non-fat]] [[retard|blonde]] who happened to be about [[midget|2-3" shorter than he was]]. The catch was that she [[what|actually seemed interested in him]], not for his [[unwarranted self importance|status]] as a [[douchebag|SF writer]], but because of some aspect of his [[fugly|lack of charm]] or [[????|whatnot]] - ergo, [[vomit|him for himself]]. [[word|Word]] spread around the [[circle jerk|con]] about this, and Harlan was [[stalker|escorting]] this [[16 year old girl|gal]] around the con as a [[you win the prize|trophy]]. It was then that [[troll|several other writers]] and [[n00b|fans]] decided it was time to give Harlan his come-uppance.''

''Flashback to a previous con. One question Harlan [[Haet|hates]] the most is when [[you|someone]] asks where the [[Line_Trap|Harlequin]] got all those [[cum|jelly beans]] he dumps on the [[goatse|Tick-Tock Man]]. At this one con, Harlan went [[batshit|ballistic]] and [[internet tough guy|threatened]] to throttle the next person who asked him that question. From all accounts, it wasn't just a [[disregard that|tirade]], it was an [[serious business|actual promise]] of [[pwn|bodily harm]] to the next poor unfortunate who made such a mistake of query. Needless to say, word spread around about this one, and a lot of people [[pussy|shied]] away from Harlan for the rest of that con.''

''Some of those in attendance were also at the con where Harlan had [[it is a mystery|apparently]] [[secks|scored]]. It was then that the [[troll|plan went into effect]]. One SF writer decoyed Harlan, while a couple of fans gave the trophy du femme a bag of - [[winrar|you guessed it]] - [[Lulz|jelly beans]]. They told her these were [[13 year old boy|Harlie's favorites]], and she could score great [[shit|brownie]] points by giving him this big bag.''

Needless to say, [[awesome|jelly beans exploded all over the convention floor]]."''

==Fail [[OTI]]==

As any [[IRL]] personality, Harlan looked for more ways to fag himself up to the masses on the [[internets]]. This includes several [[jewtube]] videos, and a website that acts more as a blog [http://harlanellison.com/quotes.htm where he quotes himself].
