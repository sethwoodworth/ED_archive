Fucking internet
Apparently, the [[internet]] is the cause of all [[irl|real life]] problems, especially those to do with accidentally broadcasting [[DJ|DJs']] live sets from large outdoor European festivals on to the radio. Once that happens, it's pretty easy to fix, because you can just recall radio waves and have them destroyed. But when someone copies them on to their hard disk and they get on to [[teh]] [[internets]], ending up as shit quality, crawlingly slow download links off of [[DogsOnAcid|one single forum]], it's SO fucking difficult to get rid of them.

Blame the internet for [[Dick Impalement]].

This [[lame]] [[meme]] was popular between about 10 people in September 2006 on music drama website [[DogsOnAcid]], along with a large variety of other shit memes such as she built her own plane, cocknose standard, rhyming sigs and I can't remember what the fuck else because most of it was lame even though secretly I masturbated to most of it at work. 

== Theme Song ==

Fucking internet has its own theme song.



''It's an open and shut case of love at first sight''

''Am I one or a million you better choose right''

''Take a chance on me, I'll drive you out of your mind''

''Can we seal the deal or will you leave me behind?''


''*backing* fucking internet''

''I see you looking at me''

''*backing* fucking internet''

''So what's it gonna be''

''*backing* fucking internet''

''I know what you like''

''Baby just call me and I'll come over tonight''


''It's a simple yes or no question, you want me or not''

''Is there someone else who gets you this hot?''

''I've got a secret hidden deep inside''

''Just pick me up and I'll take you for a ride''
