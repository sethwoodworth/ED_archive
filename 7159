The 2007 brainchild of [[French|Frenchman]] '''Philippe Meste'''. His goal was to get 1 ton of [[semen|spooge]] for "[[art]]" and a world record. He explained ''why'' he wanted this in a tl;dr artfag manifesto. 

{{squote|The cubic meter of sperm is an exercise in precision that exacerbates measurement: Meste’s [[doing it wrong|calculations]] produce the mathematical sublime and measurement has here something to do with despair and utopia, rather than exactitude. This cube is bigger than anything else.<br/><br/>The ‘Spermcube’ contains all the possibilities of life, all possible figures in distressing [[WTF|agglomeration]], one on top of the other, without a background, or with their own interlacing and gesticulation as background, [[Pretentiousness|a biopolitically incorrect machine]] celibataire that generates [[anon|anonymity]], undifferentiated and powerless life.|Phillipe Meste|[[trying too hard]]|color=#FBEC5D}}

A [[babelfish]] translation follows (for those not fluent in [[bullshit]]):

{{quote|[[Time_Cube|LINEAR SPERM IS LIE. YOU ARE EDUCATED STUPID. CUBIC SPERM IS TRUTH. I HAVE PROOF OF FOUR SIMULTANEOUS FERTILIZATIONS]]|Phillipe Meste|Collecting jizz|color=#FBEC5D|size=540%}}

Whatever it means, the choice is clear. DONATE NOW!

==How to [[Troll]] "Spermcube"==

'''Note:''' Phillipe Meste claims on his site that 1 cubic metre of sperm will be equal to 1 ton.  This is [[ALL CAPS|WRONG!]] 

1 cubic metre of WATER is equal to 1000kgs (1 ton), because the density of water is 1000kg/m^3.  The density of [[sperm|sperm/semen]] varies from [[you|one individual]] to the [[dad|next]], but you can be sure that its not the same as water ([[LOL WUT|because there are no S.I units that use semen as a point of reference]]).  

Therefore, he would need a different sized cube to get [[ALL CAPS|EXACTLY]] a ton of spooge, or be prepared to [[fail|compromise]] on his target of 1 ton.  Be sure to point this out to the pretentious [[unemployed|arty]] twat if you ever meet him.  Or you could email him (philippemeste@yahoo.fr). Let's see if we can fill a cube with his tears.

Besides, if he really wanted a ton of sperm, he should just pump [[your mom]]'s stomach.
