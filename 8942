Webcomic
{{achtung|KEEP THE LIST ALPHABETIZED.}}

[[Image:ChugworthGuroUC.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Typical]] webcomic]]

Welcome to the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] school of webcomics. In this course you will learn about the many different types of these illustrated [[blogs]] which weren't good enough to make it into print.

A [[comic]] is something found in a) the Sunday paper, b) a regular printed book like Marvel, or c) [[manga]].

Webcomics, or "online comics", are basically the same except they're on the [[Internets]] and are, almost without exception, utter shit. The important thing to understand about webcomics is that most are just shitty blogs the artist uses to present his opinion as fact. These webcomics usually consist of the characters standing around wasting panel space with stupid dialogue, making expressions that no one in real life ever makes. Such comics as ''[[Penny Arcade]]'', ''[[MegaTokyo]]'', ''San Antonio Rock City'' and ''Shortpacked'' are just that. General rule: if the author is a character in the strip, it's a fucking [[blog]].

[[John Solomon]] has made it his duty to smash the nuts of any and all bad webcomics. To date, he has succeeded in reducing several of the worst offenders to tears and fits of [[Robert_A._Howard|gibbering]].

== Type A Webcomics ==

[[Image:Type_A_Webcomic.jpg|thumb|left|[[Typical]] Type A Webcomic]]

Most popular webcomics are type A. They usually publish one strip a day with 3-5 straight panels and a punchline in the last panel. Sometimes they have story arcs which continue for a few weeks. If it's in color, it's probably block colors, maybe some shading. This type of comic is often found on [[Keenspace]] or [[LiveJournal]]. The art often sucks, but nobody cares because it's funny. If the art ''and'' the humor suck, it [[xkcd|usually]] falls off the [[internets]] after a few weeks.

Any sufficiently long-lived type A webcomic eventually starts giving its characters storylines and plots, slowly weeding out the jokes in favor of "character building", which basically means three panels of ''intentionally'' unfunny shit. In the unlikely event that this webcomic started off funny, the character building strips are usually a warning that continuing to read the strip in the future is just a waste of your time. An [[IRL]] example of this is Doonesbury.

When they're not too stupid and crass, Type A webcomics are the likeliest to be syndicated, which means that they are stupid and bland instead of merely stupid and crass. This makes them suitable for inclusion between ''Cathy'' and ''[[Family Circus]]''.

'''Examples:'''
*[[Explosm|Cyanide & Happiness]]
*[http://www.filthylies.net Filthy Lies]
*[http://www.flyingmanandfriends.com Flying Man and Friends]
*[http://www.ubersoft.net Help Desk]
*[[James L. Grant]]
*[http://www.leasticoulddo.com Least I Could Do] 
*[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html Order of the Stick]
*[http://www.pvponline.com PvP]
*[[Sabrina Online]]
*[http://twolumps.keenspace.com Two Lumps]

All of them alternate between crass and bland, with sheer stupidity being their unifying feature.

== Type B Webcomics ==

[[Image:Type_B_Webcomic.jpg|thumb|[[Typical]] Type B Webcomic]]

A4 pages, generally, sometimes with floating or weird panel layouts. Type B can be black and white or color, with various types of shading. They can be punchline-a-day comics, or might have long story arcs involving [[angst]], romance or just really extended punchlines. The stories often involve people saving the world. Most often these webcomics act like ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and, at the end of every story arc, everything is exactly the same as it used to be, more or less. If the artist is good, they sell posters and things through [[eBay]]. If they aren't, the spend time making tag boxes for their webpages and then sulking in them.

Type B Webcomics are known for devolving over time through a similar process to Type A. Not bound by space or content standards like Type A comics can be, Type B Webcomics will invariably turn into a fifty-panel-per-day [[bullshit|convoluted dramatic epic]] featuring copious [[emo]] and plot devices like rape, even if the comic began as a series of one-panel stick figure jokes. The authors of Type B Webcomics are all misogynist [[nerd]]s who watch far too much [[animu]]. As such, there is never a likable female character in a Type B Webcomic as this distracts from the [[rape]].

*[http://www.dominic-deegan.com Dominic Deegan: Oracle for Hire]
*[[Jay Naylor]]
*[http://www.laslindas.net Las Lindas]
*[[Questionable Content]]
*[http://www.somethingpositive.net Something Positive]
*[[The Legend of Razor]]
*[[Dresden Codak]] and to a better extent [[Girl Genius]].

== Type C Webcomics ==

[[Image:wikithing.jpg|thumb|[[Typical]] Type C Webcomic]]

This is basically just [[manga]] created by someone without a publisher. Generally shoujo manga, meaning 75% [[yaoi]], which tends to involve [[bishounen|bishie]] guys making out. If not, there is some other kind of romance. Cherry blossoms are common. The artists tend to be either utter crap or ridiculously talented; in both cases they sell artwork online and have large fan bases of [[moron]]s and rabid [[fangirl]]s respectively.

What makes Type C different from Type B is the fact that they are even more indebted to [[animu]]. Also, their creators tend to be fat [[cosplayers]] who, when talking, actually try to pronounce the stupid [[Azn]] emoticons they use in their hourly blog entries. Most Type C creators masturbate to a map of [[Japan]], and whatever they don't steal from anime, they steal from Harry Potter.

Type C comic makers can also be split into two groups: stuff made by [[wapanese]] fanboys, who bemoan in typical [[emo]] fashion how great their worthless existences would be if ONLY they had been fortunate enough to be born in the country of [[Japanese|moon speak]]; and stuff made by actual [[AZN]]s, who wish their naughty bits were huge like [[Xbox]]. The [[animu]] by actual AZNs sucks, but only for five dorra.

Type C comics avoid devolving like most Type A and B comics. This is because Type C comics start off as shit in the first place. 

Some of the worst [[weeaboo]] Type C comics include:
*[[Megatokyo]]
*[http://metanoia.studiowhippingboy.com Metanoia]
*[http://www.schism.org Schism]
*[[Snafu comics|Titan Sphere]]

Some Type C comics by AZNs:

*[http://pandect.keenspace.com The Pandect]

== Type D Webcomics ==

[[Image:hyperdeathbabies.gif|thumb|[[Lol|I lol'd.]]]]

Type D webcomics consist of comics that aren't totally [[unfunny]], which is an extremely rare thing on the [[internets]]. By breaking with all the [[Cartoon all stars to the rescue|stereotypes and clichés]] attached to webcomics, they manage to be (at times surprisingly) [[funny]].

== Type E Webcomics ==
[[Image:Vg_cats.jpg|thumb|right|It is hard to see who is dissing who here.]]
Type E webcomics consist of comics of any subject matter or style, but what makes them unique is that the comic designers take 6 months per comic (and that's for a comic that took them less than an hour to do). You'll often find these kinds up on [[Portal of Evil]] or [http://manga.clone-army.org clone.manga]. Nobody knows why it takes the comic designer so long to make each comic.

A [[typical]] Type E update consists of the author apologizing for not updating because [[RL]] has been sooooooo hard lately and also begging for a life. In the case of ''VG Cats'', the [[fgt|author]]/[[Aspie|illustrator]] [[paki|Scott Ramsoomair]] bitches and BAWWWs about how many [[animu]] fanmails he has to go through instead of updating on time. This is, of course, merely a cover for his true reason for not posting a comic on time. Feel obliged to visit his [http://ca.youtube.com/user/scytheboy JewTube] page. While you're there, don't help but notice what a [[typical]] loser he actually is for jumping on the [[Weeaboo]] trend bandwagon that is Caramelldansen.

== Type F Webcomics ==
[[Image:Type F Webcomic.gif|thumb|left|350px|right|[[Typical]] Type F Webcomic]]
You don't even have to try to read this one, your brain will start to melt as you try (and [[fail]]) to understand the prototype of a punchline. One chapter and you can assign the F rating to it. Depending on the [[Retard|author]], only one dialogue will be enough.

These are the webcomics that, strangely enough, don't get trolled, because they are so shitty they aren't even worth the attention (or the effort).

'''''Warning: Fail ahoy! Beware!!!'''''

'''Examples:'''

*Anything by [[User:Aussieintn|Aussieintn]] or [[Steve MacIsaac]].

[[Category:Internets Phenomena]] 
[[Category:WikiEdit Drama]]

==Type G Webcomics==

G stands for gay. This type intersects broadly with Type C, but is mostly reserved for ''[[Penny Arcade]]'''s Macintosh loving asses. The fact that the whole comic has gone downhill is a mere side effect of the mac/man love.

'''Examples:'''
*[http://www.catandgirl.com/ Cat and Girl]
*[[Chick tracts]]
*[[CTRL ALT Delete]]
*<s>[[Electric retard|Electric Retard]]</s> '''(Forums only active)'''
*[[Megatokyo]]
*[[Snafu comics]]
*[[The Dragon Doctors]]
*[[The Wotch]]

==Type H Webcomics==
H is for HTML. Comic "pages" are HTML pages and some lovely little link with fontsize 3 has to be spotted (hint: usually in the lower side of the page) and hit with ninja-assassin-accuracy in order to continue the painful journey to the last page to reach the final reward, namely ''the end'', that is, getting to do something useful for change.

'''Examples:'''
*[[Pyynö]]
*[http://www.freewebs.com/weamstherussians/ We Ams The Russians]

==Type I Webcomics==

I is for interactive, which is hilarious because this [[shit]] is far from that. Remember those "Choose Your Own Adventure" novels that littered your school's library like so much paper deadweight? Type I ("i" not "1") webcomics are like those, only on a mass scale. Interactive in nature, they seek to empower their readers by letting them choose what happens next. This has the general effect of making the "plot" of every comic done in this manner resemble the bowel movements of a pig fed nothing but powdery white sand for a month.

'''Examples:'''

*[http://www.drowtales.com/ Drow Tales]

==Type J Webcomics==

[[Image:HateSong2006-02-06.gif|thumb|right|]]

The pr0n of webcomics, these comics are intended to help you [[Masturbation|jerk off]]. However, like a tired worthless whore whose lost her dentures and is reduced to gumming phalluses, these comics will barely even register a tinge in a fanboy's pecker. These comics want to suck, they really do, but even that is beyond their meager capabilities. Expect no wank material to come from these, just [[shitting dick nipples]].

'''Examples:'''
*[http://www.wlpcomics.com/adult/cm/index.html Chocolate Milkmaid]
*[http://elle.comicgenesis.com/ Elle]
*[http://www.themagnificentmilkmaid.com/home.html Magnificent Milkmaid]
*[http://www.oglaf.com/ Oglaf]
*[[TG Comics]]

==Type K Webcomics==

"K" is for "Kid." That is, webcomics made by kids. Not overgrown [[retard|special ed]] kids who produce other types of webcomics, but actual pedobait [[children]]. This type had its origin [[at least 100 years ago]] when a [[wapanese]] guy working in [[Japan]] as a school teacher gave ''[[Penny Arcade]]'' images to his students. He then posted the results online, giving rise to a perfect [[crap]] storm of [[Plagiarism|derivative]] crap, [[Japanese]] crap, and webcomic crap.

These comics are always funnier than the originals they're based on.

*[http://www.qwantz.com/fanart/japan/ Dinosaur Comics '''Japanese English Students Version''']
*[http://yukihime.com/comics/paremix/ Penny Arcade Remix]
*[http://whiteninjacomics.com White Ninja]

== Type L Webcomics ==

Comics that are Married to the Sea. These comics are funny to fat girls, who print out the comics and tape them up in their lockers so they can hopefully show off how quirky they are! A sense of humor is <i>almost</i> as good as being attractive or not smelling like manwich, amiright?

==Type S Comics==
[[Image:Shadowadventurequest.jpg|thumb|right|A typical sprite comic.]]
Type S Comics are those made by poor pathetic creatures who, in lieu of any actual artistic ability, instead turn to ripping off video game art, i.e. sprites. While [[some argue]] that these are indeed a form of webcomic, at best they are simply [[fan fiction]]s with pictures. In any case, most sprites comics attempt to, and utterly fail to be funny. They are most often made by [[Sonic]]fags who are too lazy to learn to draw well. 

A final irony is that sprite comics are a byproduct of illegal activities due to the fact that the sprites and backgrounds are ripped from video game ROMs and [[recolor]]ed using [[MS Paint]]. Why every sprite comic creator has yet to be [[v&]]'d for this is a mystery. (Though it's probably because Nintendo and others, not wanting to upset their [[asspies]] fanbase, have said it's okay for them to shit in their own little sandbox, just as long as they [[Ubisoft#Jade haet satire|suck off]] whatever corporate execs come near them.)

== Type Y Webcomics ==

''Y aren't these webcomics better known?'' '''Type Y''' webcomics have redeeming value, but languish in relative ignonimity on the internets, usually either due to their being too funny, [[Simple English Wikipedia|too complicated]], too [[offensive]], too esoteric or too poorly [[Advertising|promoted]] to be picked up on by a broad audience. 

Ultimately, this is a result of the twisted [[natural selection]] process at work [[on the internet]]. Sadly, the "[[artist]]s" that spend 1% of their free time writing/drawing their comic and [[99%]] of their free time pimping their horrible shit are more likely to be well-known than a talented author/artist that writes for fun and only tells his or her friends about it. These authors do not [[typical]]ly treat their comics as [[serious business]] and since these authors often have a life outside of some crappy internet comic, Type Y comic series often end abruptly.

'''Examples:'''
*[[Space Moose]]

== Type Z Webcomics ==

[[Image:Type Z Webcomic.gif|thumb|150px|topright|Bee Power]]

The only funny category of webcomic. These comics are made by KC Green. Typical '''Type Z''' comics include ''Horribleville'' and ''Bee Power''. Just fucking look at the comic to the right, faggot.
