Total loss: sixty bucks.]]On [[Gaia Online]], there are these newfangled things in your accounts called "passwords". These "passwords" are how you access your account. If you give your "password" to someone else, they can access your account and also change the "password" to something only they know, thus locking you out of your account. This is known as "[[Rape|scamming]]". If you are "scammed", it is assumed to be [[asking for it|your fault]].

Most Gaiafags know the score, but '''Clementine''', [[retard|a bright and articulate 13-year Manhattanite]], thought she, her older sister, and her mother, knew better. 

{{Quote|I feel like I just witnessed my own murder.|The Gaiafag '''Clementine''' herself}}
When the obvious scamming happened, instead of filing a report, Clementine turned into the perfect [[lolcow]] and got a pair of [http://www.jackmyers.com/commentary/media-business-report/11193066.html bullshit bloggers to write an article about it], even though the article itself is littered more with wankery about the bloggers than any real news.

==What Really Happened==
[[Image:Clemintinexv3.png|thumb|238px|left|Even GAIANS are loling over her stupidity.]]
'''Clementine''' was whoring it up towns like the furfag she is.  When a male stranger repeatedly begged her to [[Cyber|gift him a cape]], she refused. Before she even finished getting rid of him, she received a PM from some account pretending to be a mod that said she'd been reported and [[lie|needed to give the mod her password]]. While this should have set off the red lights, being of [[Asperger Syndrome|slightly better intelligence than a retard]], she went and talked with her mother and sister, who {{quote|unanimously agree she should submit her password.|The consensus of idiots}}
Her account got nuked shortly afterwards.

Rather than realize what she's done is completely stupid, she unleashes [[ALL CAPS|THE FUCKING FURY]] and whines until some [[faggot|blogger]] goes and harasses Gaia for her. Eventually, the [[Jews]] finally twist Gaia's arm into giving Clementine her account back (but not her username), sans all her items except the worthless ones like her precious pet '''Water Meat'''.

==Quotes From the Article==

"[[Bullshit|To watch her slowly immerse herself in this virtual world and new personality and figure out how to negotiate these new interactions was a perfect opportunity for trial and error in a seemingly safe environment.

==Clementine Day==
[[Image:Clementine day in towns.jpg|thumb|300px|Gaiafags prey on '''Clementine''' in an attempt to imitate 4chan.]]
For a change, Gaiafags stood united, not for a decision by the admins or a newly released item, but in unity with the sheer [[lollercoaster]] Clementine had caused by being a whiny bitch.

Thus, on '''November 22, 2007''', Gaiafags whored it up by cluttering up their avatars with every goddamned [[Monthly Collectibles|monthly collectable]] and [[furry]] item they could find (plus one Water Meat!) and celebrated '''Clementine Day''', held on [[Thanksgiving]] because: 

{{quote|We will be thankful that we are SMARTER THAN THAT!|[[Truth]]|[http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/gaia-community-projects/november-22-clementine-day-dress-up-be-thankful/t.34820801/]}}

And thus, Gaiafags finally [[did it for the lulz]], and made pretty pictures with their bodies in towns, totally ripping off 4chan's [[Habbo Hotel#Raiding|highly creative]] swatiskas.

Despite the obvious faggotry involved in merely being on Gaia, '''Clementine Day''' stands as proof that there may very well be hope for Gaiafags to learn the ways of Anonymous.
