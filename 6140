[[last Thursday|Sometime before January 16]], [[2008]], [[Anonymous]] realized it had nothing better to do than get their collective panties in a twist because there is a [[Scientology|cult masquerading as a church]]. The resulting actions have snowballed into '''PROJECT CHANOLOGY''', which is a <s>covert</s> LOL overt plan to subjugate Co$ and all its affiliates. So far the most effective subjugation tactic found is replacing the letter 's' with a '$'; the plan goes on to include tactics closely mirroring the Church's own "Fair Game" <!-- look this up and spread it around --> policies which it uses to justify [[IRL trolling]] of anyone who crosses them including its own members. PROJECT CHANOLOGY (aka '''Operation Chanology''' and '''Operation CoSplay''') and its phases are currently in various stages of completion and will end only in the utter [[ruin|ruination]] of Scientology. '''PC''' is also notable for being considered [[serious business]]; when in fact it is whatever [[you]] make it. [[You]] can help by realizing '''PC''' 's broad subversive and ultimately satirical nature.

==[[All your base are belong to us|In A.D. 2008, war was beginning]]==	
[[Tom Cruise]], a [[batshit|devout]] [[Scientologist|placentafag]], taped an interview for the church that was ultimately posted on [[YouTube]]. Rather than thank the well-intentioned newfag who leaked the video, the Church of Scientology got all [[butthurt]] and had the video [[DMCA|removed]].

<s>[[butthurt|This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Church of Scientology International.]]</s> UNBALEETED

As we know all too well, [[Project Freeweb|censorship on the internets]] makes Anonymous [[RAGE|RAEG]].

==PROJECT CHANOLOGY Forms==

PROJECT CHANOLOGY began as a simple proposal.  It was initially met with skepticism, but after an intense debate PROJECT CHANOLOGY was approved.

[[faggotry|Over the years, we have been watching you. Your campaigns of misinformation; your suppression of dissent; your litigious nature, all of these things have caught our eye. With the leakage of your latest propaganda video into mainstream circulation, the extent of your malign influence over those who have come to trust you as leaders, has been made clear to us. Anonymous has therefore decided that your organization should be destroyed. For the good of your followers, for the good of mankind and for our own enjoyment.  We shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form. We recognize you as serious opponents, and do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame. However, you will not prevail forever against the angry masses of the body politic. Your choice of methods, your hypocrisy and the general artlessness of your organization have sounded its death knell.]]

[[faggotry|You have nowhere to hide, because we are everywhere.]]

[[faggotry|You will find no recourse in attack, because for each of us that falls ten more will take his place.]]

[[faggotry|We are cognisant of the many who may decry our methods as parallel those of the Church of Scientology, those who espouse the obvious truth that your organisation will use the actions of Anonymous as examples of the persecution of which you have for so long warned your followers. This is acceptable to Anonymous. In fact, it is encouraged. We are your SPs.]]


[[faggotry|Over time, as we begin to merge our pulse with that of your "Church", the suppression of your followers will become increasingly difficult to maintain. Believers will become aware that salvation needn't come at the expense of their livelihood. They will become aware that the stress and the frustration that they feel is not due to us, but a source far closer to each. Yes, we are SPs. But the sum of suppression we could ever muster is eclipsed by that of your own RTC.]]

== PROJECT CHANOLOGY Gets Underway ==

[[Image:Alexaraep.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Alexa raep]]

<br>
After the troops were rounded up all the newfags prepared to show off but they just looked like even bigger newfags for trying to turn the internet into serious business.  Starting on the 16th of January, Scientology's primary web site, Scientology.org, began to experience heavy [[DDoS]] and [[Gigaloader]] attacks. Many Scientology call centers were [[Rickroll|treated to the music of Rick Astley]] and [[Over 9000|a great number]] of pizzas and taxis were mistakenly ordered for Scientology buildings around the world.
<br>

{{clear}}

== Scientology Strikes Back ==
Eventually, the Scifags decided they had enough buttrape and in retaliation did what they always do: stick their evil [[Kendrick Moxon|lawyers]] on [[4chan|anyone and everyone]] who might be to blame. However, after further investigation into the matter it soon became clear as to [[Ebaumsworld|who was really responsible]] for all of this.

== Conditions Escalate ==

After the Scientologists websites initially went down the enemy responded with their own bandwidth attacks on the [http://insurgen.info/wiki/Project_Chanology insurgency wiki], [[ED]], and other sites hosting the plans for the raid. However, the church [[Bitches dont know|didn't know]] that anonymous is relentless and the raid continued unfazed. When Scientology.com was finally restored to working order the amount of web traffic not only returned but increased to 18 times greater than normal, a third of which was [http://howtorockstar.blogspot.com/2008/01/this-is-breaking-news-notorious-hacker.html redirects from BBC News].  The renewed PROJECT CHANOLOGY attacks in addition to the traffic due to media attention overloaded the servers and Scientology.com went down again. Unsatisfied, Anonymous acquired new targets and began taking down other Scientology websites around the world one by one. On January 21st, 10 major Scientology websites were either brought down or slowed to a crawl.

==[[Wise beard man|Mark Bunker from XenuTv]] Addresses Anonymous.==

Subsequent to the initial raids on Scifagz.com, Wise Beard Man gained [[E-fame]] in a JewTube video he made directly addressing Anonymous. In the now famous video he stated he was glad to have so many people willing to take up the Anti-[[CoS]] cause, but at the same time he was critical of some of [[rape|Anon's methods]], and he suggested Anon only utilize legal means, as he does, to fight the Scifags. For example, in his video he suggested a movement to revoke the church's tax-exempt status and thus deplete their [[Jew gold|deep coffers]]. At first, WBM distanced himself from Anon, and was wary to directly help, out of fear that the Scilons would sic their extensive team of [[e-lawyer|legal professionals]] on his ass again. Nonetheless, Anonymous took the advice he offered about peaceful protesting [[Serious Cat|seriously]], and helped ensure the subsequent successes on [[2/10]] and [[3/15]]. By successfully convincing Anon to change its strategy, Beardfag, in essence, managed to do the impossible: control [[b/|the essence of chaos on teh Intarwebs]].

==Anonymous Protesters Worldwide==

On February 10th, 2008, Anonymous showed that they can troll effectively IRL as well as online. Over 9,000 protesters crept out of their basements, bunkers, cold-water studio flats and caves and gathered at approximately 200 Scihives (Orgs and Missions) to enturbulate the ever-lovin' fuck out of some cultists. LULZ ensued. '''WIN!''' 

Scientology responded with the expected lies, attempts to censor critics, BAAAWW! and butthurt. '''FAIL!'''

'''Various FAIL responses from Scilons included (but were not limited to):'''
* the usual Fair Game tactics of hiring private investigators to stalk protesters
* bullbaiting
* namefagging
* facefagging
* assaulting protesters (grabbing masks, bumping into or impeding protesters from using public walkways)
* filing frivolous lawsuits
* hiding behind enormous walls of shipping containers
* illegally closing down sidewalks and public roadways (and harassing elderly and disabled non-Anonymous neighbors)
* attempting to ban Anonymous from retail establishments and restaurants by pressuring the owners of same to put up anti-Anonymous signage
* inflicting property damage (vehicles with slashed tires, dents, etc.)
* killing pets (R.I.P. Mudkips--good night, sweet prince, etc.)
* getting Anons fired
* trying to use local law enforcement officers as their personal army (which resulted in at least three arrests worldwide; charges later dropped)
* sending out DVDs full of faked footage and hyperbolic and self-serving lies to uninvolved people who may or may not have underage B& kids protesting & delivering those DVDs by impersonating process servers and police officers
* filing frivolous copyright claims to get pro-Anonymous videos yanked
* throwing eggs and water at protesters
* interfering with a major Anonymous protest planning webforum's ability to use Google AdSense to raise revenue
* denying the truth about OTIII / Xenu
* sending out flocks of [[OSA]] tards to spam every blog or news site that mentions Scientology in a less than glowing light (these people are VERY busy at the moment)
* sending out flocks of OSA tards and NarCONon apologists to spam anti-CoS videos on YouTube and elsewhere
* stealing protest signs
* destroying protest signs
* attempting to intimidate protesters
* preventing small children from getting a delicious sammich at a Subway
* showing up with a motherfucking GUN at a peaceful protest (WTF)

and 

* taking eleventy bazillion videos and photos of protesters.

Anon only gets MOAR excited when the Scientologists [[Your_resistance_only_makes_my_penis_harder%21|struggle]]. (LOL. Insert appropriate meme here.)(fix'd)

==19 months on==

Naturally, there has been the usual in-fighting that occurs within any herd of cats, but lulzfags, newfags and moralfags continue to get their jollies every month (and sometimes MOAR often than that), with occasional participation of oldfags, g00ns, *tards and other disreputable characters. 

Meanwhile, a bunch of oldfags and non-moralfags are up to SRS BSNS as well.

==A very, very small sample of Anonymous WINS against Scientology== 

* Virtually ALL Scilon top $ekrit dox now available online for free
* Wired, RADAR and MAXIM and many other  magazine articles
* Moles within the CoS
* New ex-Scis, reconnecting with friends and family
* Old ex-Scis speaking out
* Exposing the illegal activities and abusive practices of the "Church" of Scientology to previously uninformed members of the general public
* Encouraging the press to print the truth more and more often now that the Scilons are too busy to Fair Game ''all'' critics at once
* A ZOMG! ''positive'' report from [[Fox News|FAUX NEWS]] (of all people)
* Several Orgs closed at least once and often more than once each month
* Several Orgs and Missions presumed to be CLOSED DUE TO /r/AIDS
* Stress Table recruitment thwarted
* Incriminating video of Scilon misbehavior shot and shared
* MOAR dox dropped with the FBI
* Courts worldwide slapping down frivolous litigation from the cult
* Top level Scilons suddenly missing (probably sent to the [[RPF]] / Scilon gulag)
* Public opinion notably much cooler towards Scientology
* Being complimented by [[Rick Astley]] and [[V for Vendetta|Alan Moore]]
* Exposing more and more Scilon front groups
* Increased cooperation and support from law enforcement worldwide
* Helping Tom Cruise ruin his own career by publicizing every dumbass thing he says or does
* Hundreds of newspaper articles, blogs and references about Anonymous worldwide, the VAST majority of which are positive

and

* Lots of enjoyment at Scilon footbulletry.
