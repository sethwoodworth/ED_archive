Patrick Mannix Snr, otherwise know as Flaglerchat or Obnoxious Bitch is a [[Old|wizard aged]] internet cancer fail troll that spread from real life onto a number a websites owned by [[niggers|good people]]. Flaglerchat specializes in trolling the personal information of people, and following them around the internet with said information, always ready to remind you he has a rough idea of [[Moderator|your name]], your [[Internet|geographical location]] and a [[Camwhore|blurry photo]] from 1991 you use on facebook. He has never successfully been permabanned from any forum as he is a [[7 Proxies|computer genius]]. 

[[Last Thursday|In the past]] Flaglerchat worked irl in positions such as a postal worker that enabled him access to personal information so he could troll all of [[Bristol|Bristol]] Virginia with his mad skillz at accumulating thousands of dollars worth of legal debts from court battles he lost. He has been [[Jailhouse_gay|arrested and ejected]] from public meetings over thirteen times. He has made over 1,000 harassing calls to talk radio, and 3 different radio stations filed criminal charges against him. Mannix/Flaglerchat has filed so many frivolous lawsuits in Washington County, he is banned from ever filing one there again. In fact, because he was so disruptive, Washington county banned public speaking at meetings all together.

Whether it be at public meetings, message boards, or talk radio, below is the time line of a man obsessed with causing [[fail|trouble]] in public forums.

==IRL Drama==

Now, legally forbidden from harassing the Washington County Supervisors anymore, Mannix turns his obsession elsewhere.

==More Fail==

*2005 Mannix charged in [[rednecks|Tennesee]] with telephone harassment.
''Exhibit A; "Pat Mannix Calls to WPWT 870AM" provided to the Sullivan County Law Court by Information Communications Corporation, indicates that Pat Mannix attempted to call WPWT 870AM "Good Morning Tri-Cities" 521 times between September 5, 2005 and October 10, 2005 and also attempted to call the afternoon WPWT 870AM "The Local View" program 252 times between September 5, 2005 and October 10, 2005.''

*2007 Mannix runs for Sheriff, uses Topix dot com for his mudslinging campaign against Sheriff Newman, loses election.[http://www.topix.com/forum/city/abingdon-va/T691DK7HDQ83HM4R9]*[http://www.topix.com/forum/city/abingdon-va/TU1GMT4K8NOQ60983]

*2007 Mannix starts trolling "The Marc Bernier Show".
After calling this radio show over 150 times, they block Mannix from calling. Mannix sues the show for refusing to accept his calls. The lawsuit went badly for Mannix, because when all was said and done, he was ordered to pay over $10,000 to Bernier's attorneys.

*2007 Sues radio host Marc Bernier for $3,000 for refusing to accept his phone calls

*2008 Bernier counter sued and won [[Over_9000|$10,000]] for attorney fees. Mannix actually sued Marc Bernier's lawyers secretary over this one.

Since 1989, Mannix has sued 28 times in Washington County Circuit Court, not counting a divorce case and an application for a concealed handgun permit. He has sued three times in Bristol Circuit Court, not counting the Bernier case. He would not discuss in detail how he finances his legal crusades, but estimated that he has sunk perhaps [[Over_9000|$10,000]] in them over more than two decades. He would spend that much again fighting to deny Bernier’s attorneys from collecting money he thinks they’re not entitled to, he said.

Mannix’s case against Florida-based radio host Marc Bernier – for refusing to take his phone calls and taking out a warrant for [[Mel_gibson|telephone harassment]] – has long since flipped the other way, as Bernier successfully reversed the $3,000 default judgment entered against him, and a circuit court judge slapped Mannix with hefty sanctions.

Mannix contested the initial [[Over_9000|$10,000]] in sanctions – designed to punish someone who sues frivolously or to harass – all the way to the Supreme Court. After the high court refused to hear the appeal, Bernier’s lawyers – who by then had racked up more fees defending the appeal – filed a petition to tack another $1,000 of expenses onto Mannix’s bill. The circuit court judge presiding over the case approved it – and went a step further.

"Mr. Mannix is ordered to make payments of at least $200.00 per month until the full amount of monetary sanctions is paid," states the Aug. 21, 2009, order approved by Judge Isaac St. Clair Freeman. Freeman also ordered that he would "superintend ministerially the execution of [his] orders, including enforcement of the Court’s directive that Mr. Mannix make regular minimum monthly payments."

But Mannix did not pay. [[Crybaby|He appealed]].

==TROLOLOL is born==
[[Image:Question-Flaglerman.jpg|thumb|UR DOING IT WRONG]]
Pat Mannix goes back on Topix to slam Marc Bernier. [http://www.topix.com/forum/city/daytona-beach-fl/T8N0GKFQF3D996SV8]

Also starts a very "Flaglerchat like" blog badmouthing Bernier. Posts PI accusing him of having a gay husband, and that his gay husband beats him "like a rented mule".*[http://marcbernierisnotmygaywife.wordpress.com/]

This is where Patrick Mannix decided to be more careful about hiding his identity. He split his lust for PI and his natural gadfly personality into 2 distinct characters. The first, Flaglerchat, a 15 yr old boy who posts nonsensical strings of PI. Mannix/Flaglerchat has literally hundreds of alternate accounts, and literally thousands of permanent and throw away IP and email addresses. But his most famous alternate account, a [[Apple#Apple_Users|35 year old transvestite]] named Obnoxious Bitch, fulfilled his desire to be a gadfly.

But instead of annoying the Washington County Board of Supervisors, Mannix/Flaglerchat focuses his rage at [[forums|message board]] owners through his creation Obnoxious Bitch. OB is the champion of Flaglerchat's right to post peoples private information and his own #1 fan.
