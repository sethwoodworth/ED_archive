[[Image:EFatG.jpg|thumb|Epic fat guy. This is what he was doing midnight Christmas Eve.]]

'''Epic fat guy''' is a [[fat]], [[fat|disgusting]], [[fat|smelly]] [[camwhore]] who <del>regularly posts</del> one time posted in [[b|/b/]] performing any requests.

Not to be confused with [[Epic Fail Guy]], although they both [[fail]] incredibly hard.

==Story of Epic Fat Guy==

<s>Loved by some, hated by many</s> ''Sorry chubster, no one has a strong opinion about you either way because you are barely worth noticing; just another freak in the /b/ freak parade.'' 

This hideous hambeast /b/tard [[lonely|attempts to be noticed]] by showing his rolls of flab and tiny [[penis]]. Showing a pathetic [[nice guy|willingness to please]], he will do [[Put Shoe On Head|virtually anything requested of him]] and take photos of the humiliation, and then posts them on /b/. He claims he has had [[sex]] with a real live girl, but anyone can pony up 20 bucks for a Mexican [[whore]], so [[Herpes|what]] does that prove, exactly?

He hopes to lose weight in the future, but realistically this is unlikely...no fatty can resist the greasy siren song of [[McDonald's|McDiabeetus]].

He is 18 and lives in central [[California]].

In his first thread he [[Sick Fuck|came on a pic of his mother]], who looks like a female version of him.

==Self-loathing and Obesity: Correlation or Causation?==

Epic Fat Guy not only exposed himself to certain ridicule and contempt on /b/, but perhaps even started this article himself. While he can pretend to others that he's being "fat-positive" or "reclaiming the body-image narrative" some other nonsense, he must know in the depths of his overburdened, cholesterol-clogged [[heart]] that he is a hated outcast and will [[Dying alone|die alone]].

For those who wish to contact Epic Fat Guy, he was nice enough to place his email on 4chan: talon2066@yahoo.com
