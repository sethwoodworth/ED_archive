'''Jasonrivera.com''' is the go-to site for everything. If you're a [[13-year-old boy]]. There's [[professional wrestling]], [[:Category:Gaming|video game]] [[Video Game Reviewers|reviews]], and interviews of [[Amalea|soft core porn models]]. At times he has a case of [[unwarranted self-importance]]. Many of the articles at jasonrivera.com urge you to use their forums, because jason rivera is a lonely, sad man.

The mediocrity of the content of Jasonrivera.com is [[Uncyclopedia|nothing to be laughed at.]] If you by chance happen to view ANYTHING on Jasonrivera.com, wash your eyes with a generous dose of [[Encyclopediadramatica]].



== A guide to some of their columns ==
=== 50 Gayest Things Ever ===
If you partake in any of these you are a [[faggot]] lolololol. Especially if you partake in allergies (#10). Notably, furries, I <3 Gay Porn bumper stickers, and an actual gay porn site don't make its top 10. The fact that the staff has their pictures and email addresses readily available in addition to this article makes it easy to create an especially infuriating gay profile on any number of dating websites. 
=== Picking on Burn Victims/Ugly people ===
Because making fun of fat cosplayers and ugly people on hotornot is much too difficult for the average person to accomplish. Thanks, assholes. Its not original or funny, and despite trying way too hard to be offensive no one gives enough of a shit to send hatemail.
=== [[Camwhore]] Week 2002 ===
[[Image:Gutkick.jpg|thumb|This image brought to you by Jasonrivera.com]]
Free porn [[^_^]].
=== In Poor Taste ===
Easily the best part of the site, despite seeing the same shit everywhere else from equally untalented people. Topics include: Gook day, fuck missing children, and how much Hurricane Katrina victims suck. 
=== Actors ===
Currently just one interview of some actress who played a supporting role in some movie you've never heard of. 
=== Adult Model Interviews ===
[[Noone]] reads the words, but 100% of the hits to these pages just ogle the pics, fap, and leave.
=== Fake Interviews ===
You'd expect satire here, but instead you get an interview of that purple thing from [[fat|McDonald's]].
=== More Than Meets the Eye ===
Transformers [[fanboy]]ism. What an obscure show for so many people to make references to 20+ years later.
=== Music ===
Making fun of Backstreet Boys is [[old meme]]. The site is not brave enough to make fun of [[The Beatles|anything anyone still likes]].
=== Random articles ===
Most notable is an article making fun of [[Maddox]], the guy who's been doing the same thing as them, for about the same length of time, with [[at least 100]] times more success.

=== Wrestling ===
Go [[Professional_Wrestling|here]] for article.
