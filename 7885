Suburbs

The '''Suburbs''', also known as "suburbia" or "the burbs", is an assembly-line built housing community that one day [[your mom|everyone]] will live in.  In the outskirts of cities suburbs grow rapidly like a spreading [[The cancer that is killing /b/|cancer]] on the landscape devouring [[vespene gas|resources]], farmland, and hope along the way.  The suburban community consists of a specific ratio:

[[over 9000|Per 10,000]] [[George Carlin|identical houses, with identical soccer moms, who drive identical minivans and have identical kids named Jason and Jenniferrrrr]], there are:
*15 [[Wal-Mart]]s
*20 Strip Malls
*30 Jew
*50 Gas stations
*200 [[Democrat|DNC]] offices
*[[At least 100]] 7-11 outlets
*[[Over 9000]] fast food restaurants
*[[Shit nobody cares about|And a partri~dge in a pear tre~e!]]

All families from the suburbs are Jew and have at least two SUVs per child they have, as well as both parents who work.  Suburbs create many problems starting with the children who are [[Asperger's Syndrome|spoiled beyond all belief]] with the [[Unlimited disposable income|massive amount of income]] [[theft|generated]] by both parents.  Since the parents put their jobs and plans for that new Hummer that needs to fill the eighth empty garage spot first, the children are left at home with the T.V on to act as a babysitter.  With the combination of watching such mindfucking garbage as [[MTV]] as well as having unmoderated access to the [[internets]], the kids will turn into some of the worst scum of society.

The boys will turn into dumbass [[wiggers]] who can't speak a word coherent English, and the girls will turn into slutty dressing [[prostatot|prostatots]] who pull all sorts of [[attention whoring|stupid shit]] thanks to sites like [[Livejournal]], [[MySpace]] and  DeviantART.  All this [[retard|violently stupid behavior]] [[Asperger's Syndrome|goes unpunished]] because [[Some argue|society now believes]] that discipline and a good spanking [[ADD|is child abuse]], so drugging them with [[Ritalin]] for the [[ADHD|hyper]], and [[Paxil]] for the [[emo]] is the more "humane" solution.  Suburbs are only second to the Deep South in terms of inbreeding. There is no medication for that though and instead it is accepted as another [[liberal]] [[incest|alternative lifestyle]] based in the tenets [[hippies|peace and love]].

== [[Divide by zero|Destruction of Society]] ==

Due to such long ways out of the communities and lack of proper transit everyone must have a car, making suburbs the biggest cause of traffic in cities, pollution, and SUV rollover fatalities.  Another problem is everyone will eventually become fat and have [[diabeetus]] since everyone eats fast food.  One day, estimated in a few years, society will come crashing down when the spoiled little [[fucktard|fucktards]] who lived on their [[Daddy's money lesbian|parents dime]] for all their lives, will have to get work to support themselves and their [[Juliana Wetmore|should-have-been-aborted]] [[Littlekuriboh|offspring]] when their parents [[An hero|die]].  The parents were the last generation without the instant gratification of the internets which actually made them able to focus and gain their successful careers instead of ignoring schoolwork to [[shit nobody cares about|check the latest message they got on Facebook]].

Further apocalypse will result from all the CO2 emissions from SUVs causing [[global warming]] to melt the ice caps and flood the Earth.  With these waters combining with trillion tons of garbage created by fast food outlets; the streets  will flow with filth and cause global [[AIDS]].  We can only hope the [[Russia|Ruskies]] nuke all the suburbs before that can happen.

And nothing of value will be lost.
