{{quote|You have seen them everywhere - self help topics of Anonymous begging for help with his life. Some people have no idea how they should dress other than wearing a Pantera t-shirt with jeans that their mother bought for them five years ago. Some have no idea how to approach women and spend their time masturbating to loli. And some just want to know if they should shave their pubes. 
Here, my friends, is your answer. Written by anon, edited by anon, and perfected by anon. Every single tip,
trick, and barrel roll you will ever need to know without having to ask for help.|Anon}}

==Who the hell made this?==
[[You]] made this. Well, no, not ''you''. You haven't done a god damned thing with your [[life]]. By you, I mean Wikichan.org. [[Wiki]][[chan]] was a website set up by users of [[Chans_Portal|*chan]] to [[save]] much of the [[content]] they had [[crap|created]]. After crashing multiple times over a period of eight or nine months, Wikichan shut down permanently on 22 November 2007, and the sysop disappeared without notice.

Somehow, some-when, between then and now, [http://wikichan.net/ Wikichan] came back online. Of course, it's not the same Wikichan, it's a different [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|Wikichan]].

==Why You Need This Book==

Life has lots of questions you can't answer you [[Ignorant]] fuck. Questions like: Should I trim my pubes or let them grow? Will Nair burn my Vagoo? What type of clothes do I look good in?
