Pokéclipse
Did you have a childhood? Did you ever watch/play/read stuff about fantasy worlds, with magic, monsters and [[Cody Porter|Sand Ninjas]]? If so, then you’ve probably (briefly) thought there’s a chance that the fantasy world is a real place you can go to [[Masturbate|if you just wish hard enough]]. Then you discover drugs and wonder why you thought that, or anything in life, was hard to do.

Some people just can’t let that dream go. Most of these dedicated fans grow up to be the [[Wapanese|Weeaboos]] and [[Furry|furries]] who rape our childhood memories with [[Fanfiction|fan]] [[Fanart|works]]. The rest dedicate their time and effort to showing them, [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Pokemans.jpg SHOWING THEM ALL] that their Pokeymanz are real beings [http://z9.invisionfree.com/Pokeclipse/index.php?showtopic=508 who conveniently know how to use cross-dimensional IM].

One day, an anon came across [[Digimon#DIGIMANS_ARE_REAL|Digiclipse]], a collection of Digimon believers who were trying to open black holes in the sky by waving their licensed toys in the air and while shouting any word they could pin 'digi-' to the front of. After sharing the site with /v/, an elaborate plan was formed, and one of the lulziest trolls of the year began...

== We all live (Yeeeee-ahhhhh) in a Pokémon World ==

[[Image:Kamikaze.png|right|thumb|Your friends just got OWNED!]]

The idea for the site was spawned on /v/ as a parody response to Digiclipse, and was meant to be built up gradually and revealed on or around April Fool’s Day as a troll site, exposing the e-IDs of as many [[Insane|fuck-mental]] [[Faggot|fgts]] as possible. The premise was predictably insane: Claim that the Pokémon world is actually a parallel universe that the game’s creators have traveled to, where they decided they could make money by creating a franchise back here based on what they had seen there. Therefore, the ‘believers’ of this <s>theory</s> [[Fact|FACT]] would either have to discover their own means of getting there, or raid Nintendo for their secret.

The community origin story fed to the site’s visitors (to explain away the fact that nobody had a join date older than a few days) was that the community had been created by the user ‘Mew2’ back in 2005, but had suffered raids and a [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|database purge]] at the hands of [[Raid|lulz-seekers]]. This was apparently their new forum, and they were trying to get back on their feet.

The site quickly became a mix of expert trolls (who ran the show), wannabe trolls who weren’t in on the fun, and some fags who genuinely believed in this shit. The obvious trolls were [[Banhammer|b&]] instantly, but not before the string-pullers used the troll remnants as proof that they were [[Rape|a real community that was under attack]].

Over the days, the forum became filled with IRL butthurt stories, shooped photographic evidence and speculative questions like “[http://z9.invisionfree.com/Pokeclipse/index.php?showtopic=250 Would you marry your Pokémon?]” Some brave ones dropped their AIM names, even, to discuss things with non-believers.

== C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER ==

Before most of the trolls’ elaborate fanfics and MSPaint edits could be unleashed, a bunch of script kiddies ([http://www.somethingawful.com/d/weekend-web/collarme-digiclipse.php?page=4 presumably from Something Awful]) raided and hacked the forums of the Digiclipse folks, who were still in orgasm cooldown from their first worldwide ‘Hold a plushie in the air and pretend it’s fucking you’ event.

With their trap target now gone, Pokéclipse was about to give up, but something amazing happened...World of Warcraft's forums and GameFAQs's Current Events board got a hold of Pokeclipse, and had no clue about the board's true nature. Though on many occasions the troll was endangered by retards trying too hard, the admin SmellYouLater played damage control. So they continued on, from Saturday, March 22nd, to the early hours of March 27th, when they were hacked.

Without any proper lines of communication, SmellYouLater was unable to stop Mew2, another admin, from slapping together a shitty "it was a joke" post, followed shortly by a wall of text in which another user laid down the law on the faggots who believed it was real shit, dropping a list of all the faggots who trolled him on AIM, and a mere few of the sites that believed it was real shit. The other trolls in on the joke came out from under the bridges and did some public fist-pounding before parting ways (but not before promising to team up once again in the future). 

The fun may have ended early, but vanloads of lulz were still produced. People were unblocked from AIM to let the butthurt flow everywhere.

== AIM Transcripts ==

Trolls trolling trolls. Oh lawd.

* crackeatsme: like i really doo
* crackeatsme: but like...
* crackeatsme: how is it real.
* Krillin33434: I don't understand the question
* Krillin33434: what's real is real
* crackeatsme: how are pokemon life?
* Krillin33434: I still don't quite understand your question.
* Krillin33434: They exist
* Krillin33434: as sentient physical entities
* crackeatsme: how though?
* crackeatsme: they are cartoon
* Krillin33434: The cartoon is a cartoon
* Krillin33434: the real pokemon are real
* crackeatsme: like
* crackeatsme: pichachoo and shit?
* Krillin33434: We're not saying that the cartoons are somehow real
* crackeatsme: so your saying like mew and mew 2 are real and shit?
* Krillin33434: we're saying that there is a real pokemon universe, and that the cartoons and games are based off of it
* Krillin33434: yes
* crackeatsme: oh
* crackeatsme: and where is the universe?
* Krillin33434: you can't really say where, it's another universe
* crackeatsme: so why make a site where u cant get to it?
* Krillin33434: that's the goal of the site: to get to it
* crackeatsme: ok and have u ever Seen a pokemon?
*9 Krillin33434: yes
*9 crackeatsme: which
*9 crackeatsme: ?
*9 Krillin33434: several bulbasaur, some oddish as well as its evolved forms, and a few flying types I don't quite remember
* Krillin33434: either pidgey's or spearows
* Krillin33434: all at once
* crackeatsme: where u on drugs?
* Krillin33434: no
* Krillin33434: I've never taken any halluciongens
* crackeatsme: ok and why cant i see them?

* crackeatsme: wtf lol..
* crackeatsme: like soo
* crackeatsme: are ppokemon real and the characters like ash/?
* Krillin33434: Well, there's no evidence that satoshi exists. He's probably a fictional character added to the properties as a generic protagonist. The games aren't linked to the reality in any way, it's simply based off of what the creator of the games saw
* crackeatsme: dude
* crackeatsme: there pokemon
* crackeatsme: have u ever captured one?
* Krillin33434: of course not, I've never seen any outside of my initial vision
* crackeatsme: do u see them often?

* crackeatsme: ok an so for..
* crackeatsme: how far have u gotton to the pokeclipse
* Krillin33434: well, I think we were pretty close to pinpointing where the dimensional shifts were originating from
* Krillin33434: but all of our data got lost when the old forums went down
* Krillin33434: so we have to start over
* crackeatsme: wherees that
* Krillin33434: If I knew, I wouldn't be here now would I?
* crackeatsme: where do u think it came from?
* Krillin33434: where do I think what came from?
* crackeatsme: pokeclpsE?
* crackeatsme: lmao..
* Krillin33434: you can't use pronouns if you haven't established the noun
* Krillin33434: the pokeclipse forums?
* crackeatsme: ..
* crackeatsme: dude

*9 Krillin33434: a vision or a pokemon?
*9 Krillin33434: stop using pronouns incorrectly
*9 crackeatsme: poke
*9 Krillin33434: you'd have to see one during a dimensional shift
*9 Krillin33434: or have a vision like mine
*9 crackeatsme: whatsa dimensional shift?
*9 Krillin33434: it's not really a voluntary phenomenon
* Krillin33434: basically it means that the waves of energy and antimatter from a wormhole between dimensions temporarily shift something through the wormhole
* Krillin33434: then pulls it back
* Krillin33434: physically they stay in the same place, but are transferred very shortly to a parralel universe
* crackeatsme: and when does this happen?
* Krillin33434: at random intervals
* crackeatsme: ...........
* crackeatsme: qwhen in life

* crackeatsme: on ur site.
* Krillin33434: what?
* Krillin33434: We're not accredited to hand out doctorates if that's what you're asking...
* crackeatsme: yes
* Krillin33434: I'm having a lot of trouble understanding you
* crackeatsme: but just as a rank on ur site.
