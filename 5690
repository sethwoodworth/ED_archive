NeoPets: The Darkest Faerie
[[Image:Neopets_-_The_Darkest_Faerie_Coverart.png|thumb|A srs rpg for furries.]]

'''''The Darkest Faerie''''' isn't as cool as it may sound. Remember that website you went on when you were 8 and played furry games, while taking care of your own virtual pet? Some people never grew past that website. Some never matured and blossomed into adulthood. Those people were [[furry|furries]], and they wanted moar.

==''The Darkest Faerie'''s Birth and Reception==

On November 15, 2005, [[NeoPets]] decided to take their obsession one step further. They wanted to create a [[lie|hardcore rpg]] that any [[loser|gamer]] would be [[basement dweller|proud]] to own. An rpg that one would be proud to say, "Yes, I play this game and I've beaten it [[over 9000]] times."

Unfortunately this game fell a bit [[midget|short]]. Not many hardcore gamers were proud to say they spent all their time roleplaying [[furries]] outside of a forum. The only people who wanted this game and wanted to play it all the way through were [[jailbait|10-12 year olds]] and furries themselves.

The concept seemed very intriguing to the [[RPG]] players. The title brought to mind an epic quest to seal away the most evil of [[gay|Faeries]]. Along the way, meeting small creatures to help you. Using magic and battling mythical creatures. A double-take reminded them that it was a NeoPets game.

==Gameplay and Story==

The story is that some evil fairy chick ([[badass|The Darkest Faerie]]) got locked away underwater as a statue for a million years or something, for trying to take over Neopia. The spell keeping her there got [[Terri Schiavo|weak]] and she, '''DUN DUN DUN''', managed to escape and come back to the world. She was fucking pissed that the fairy queen ([[slut|Fyora]]) [[scissoring|imprisoned]] her underwater and left her to die, so she goes to choke the bitch.

Meanwhile a wolf [[redneck]] furry named [[retard|Tor]] was suddenly, for no reason whatsoever, inspired to go on an epic quest. He goes to become a knight and is accepted immediately, even though he's been on a farm his whole life. He goes to save another useless fairy chick ([[camwhore|Illusen]]) and comes back to find The Darkest Faerie has everyone under her control or something. She made the world dark.

While this is happening, in another far far away land, a furry girl magician ([[trap|Roberta]]) is sent to save Fyora and destroy the nameless evil fairy. She and Tor meet up somehow and realize their destinies are woven together. They fuck and go to kick some ass. Shit happens and then Neopia is saved! And the Darkest Faerie is locked away in a statue '''again''', but kept in Fyora's bedroom so she can [[masturbate|keep a close eye on her]] from now on.

The game is played as Tor or Roberta. You battle other furries and make smaller furries become your minions to follow you and chew out whoever calls you a fag. Also, Roberta is the only one who can use magic because Tor fails and needs to drown in a sack thrown into a waterfall. Along with all the other furries.

==Fans==
Not surprisingly all of the NeoPets players fap to this game nonstop. It has even led people to join NeopPets and revolve their life around the virtual animals. Typical fans of the video game are mostly girls, ranging from [[Dick_Neck|10-18 years old]], or 6 year old boys. They love to produce shitty art and orgasm over the game with each other.
