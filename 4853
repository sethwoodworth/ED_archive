[[Image:Limecat2.jpg|thumb|Original]]
[[Limecat]] is an [[internet]] [[meme]] featuring an angry-looking cat with a lime cut to resemble a helmet on its head, although in fact [[shit noone cares about|it is more likely to be a Pomelo]]. Being a cat with a lime on its head, it is by nature a [[joke|sourpuss]].  Hundreds of captions were added, making it a popular [[image macro]]. Its cousins are [[Lemonparty|Lemoncat]] (see below) and Mooncat. It will provide much [[lulz]] until just now, when we forget about it and go back to masturbating to [[Jameth]]. [[shit nobody cares about|The original image was originally lifted from the ''Command & Conquer'' fansite CNCDEN by a]] [[Kingdom of Loathing]] [[shit nobody cares about|forum user named Weens.]]

== Wikipedia Involvement ==
[[Wikipedia]], in its noble effort to destroy all existence of silly internet [[meme]]s, deleted Limecat in [[butthurt|retaliation]] for the addition of a link to this article in the Wikipedia entry by [[Karwynn]] and a [[Hardvice]] impersonator [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Limecat_%282nd_nomination%29].  Deciding that spiting the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|Superior Wiki]] was more important than documenting internet knowledge, [[Hipocrite]] and several others argued for its deletion.  They should be [[piss|piddled]] on. [[Rootology]] and [[badlydrawnjeff]] advocated keeping it, resulting in massive [[fail]]ure.  For those too busy to read [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Limecat_%282nd_nomination%29 this], it essentially said:

* '''Keep''' - This is a common internet meme, easily recognizable and likely to be searched for on Wikipedia.  Minor subjects are still worth writing about.
* '''DELETE''' - I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS, IT MUST NOT BE NOTABLE!
* '''DELETE''' - BASED ON [[completely irrelevant history|HISTORY OF KEEP VOTERS]], WHO ARE ALL [[fag|FAGS]].
* '''DELETE''' - HAHA, I WILL NOW MAKE A SARCASTIC COMMENT ABOUT HOW FANTASTIC LIMECAT IS!!!!!
* '''DELETE''' - FUNNY THINGS ARE NOT ENCYCLOPEDIC!
* '''DELETE''' - As much as I love limecat, this is not something I will remember in 5 years. So much unlike everything else on Wikipedia.
** '''COMMENT''' - I will always remember the limecat.  LIMECAT [[9/11|NEVAR FORGET]]!!
* '''DELETE''' - ALL KEEP VOTERS ARE [[troll|TROLLS]] AND [[sockpuppet|SOCKPUPPETS]] AND ENEMY [[Blu Aardvark|SPYVANDALHACKERS]] WHO WANT TO KILL US AND [[AIDS|RAPE OUR WOMEN]]!
(We know that is untrue, however, because there are [[no women on the internet]].)

The result of the discussion was '''go with the flow''', and concentrate harder on obtaining a fascist hold on information.  As usual in a deletion debate, the losing side was told to [[GTFO]] of Wikipedia.
