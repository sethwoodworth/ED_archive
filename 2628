Elitist Musical Bastards
[[image:Chewbacca.gif|thumb|right|LOLDONGS!!!!!]]
Those who can play guitar, do.  Those who can't, idolize.  Elitist musical bastards tend to come in several varieties, but all of them have in common that they are [[Aspies|devoted music listeners]].

== The Guitar God ==
{{quote|Joe Satriani is a technically proficient player, not like those talentless hacks who can sing and write songs.}}

The guitar god  can be found bragging about his conquests in [[chat room]]s and [[message board]]s all across the internet.  He '''knows''' what D#m7sus is, and he's not afraid to let you know that he knows it. He is '''[[an hero|A Guitar Hero]]'''.

You can insult God and country to the Guitar God, but any bad word about Satriani, [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], Vai, Hendrix, or Petrucci will result in immediate [[drama]] and [[lulz]]. 

Ironically, most of these self proclaimed "shredders" couldn't actually "shred" if their lives depended on it, and the only thing they "sweep" is the floor of a [[McDonald's]] or [[Burger King]] 10 hours per week. The guitar god is never even half as good as he thinks he is at playing or writing. If he was, then he would have a career in music, and he would not be spending his days on messageboards attempting to criticize those that actually ''do'' have a career in music. When forced to present a recording of his accomplishments, most Guitar Gods will present you with a bland love ballad or a soulless classic rock song which is nearly about 30 years out of style.  Telling him this is another excellent [[drama-generating technique]].

== [[Gay|The Cock-Sucking Theorist]] ==
{{quote|I was playing Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and it's in the key of C# minor! I know what a weird key. Anyways I completely rocked it since I'm so great at piano.}}

The Cock-Sucking Theorist is possibly the hardest of Elitist Musical Bastards to find. He is usually in a [[Pretentious|band or orchestra class]] in [[school|highschool]]. They likely think they can read music at a [[Retarded|basic level]] and have written some, but they [[stfu|won't shut the fuck up]] about how great they think they are. This includes playing very easy songs/pieces and bragging about it to everyone, saying [[erection|it's very hard]].

It's very easy to be a Cock-Sucking Theorist. Anyone who goes around saying they are [[liar|really good at piano or guitar]] and explains how hard something is can be a CST. If you are a [[Guitar Hero|musician]] and don't want to be a [[cunt|piece of shit]], just don't talk about the music you play or write. If you are with some friends, casually bring it up or play it. If they complement you, say thank you, and don't go into depth. [[You|You]] don't want to appear like a [[Giant dildo of death|dildo]] who talks about more than they actually [[Nothing of value|know]].

'''Favorite bands'''

*Ludwig Van Beethoven(though they probably don't actually listen to it)
*Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(though they probably don't actually listen to it)
*Miles Davis(same as above)

== The Thinker ==
{{quote|You just don't get how deep '''The Wall''' is.  It's like, there's this [[redundant|wall]] around him, and the [[redundant|wall]] symbolizes a [[redundant|wall]].}}

If personal angst and agony are involved, the Thinker will defend this piece of music to the death.  [[Hippies]] were the first of this ilk.  To them, music was about [[The Man]] keeping you oppressed and [[raping]] the [[Global Warming|environment]] when he's not raping you and oppressing the environment.  If you don't like whatever [[pretentious|pseudo-philosophical]] or "politically conscious" shitty music that the Thinker is trying to pass off as "the absolute epitome of human expression" or something, they will usually accuse you of being "too feeble minded to comprehend the music" or something similar and equally laughable.

Today, most [[goth]] and [[emo]] kids fall into this category.  Unlike their hippie parents, they don't give a [[shit]] about world affairs and trees.  The modern thinker is all about his own [[angst]].  He will even go as far as to tell you that he's being insightful and intelligent - not a [[crybaby]].

Create lulz by telling the Thinker that their self-serving depression is the shallowest and/or funniest thing you've ever seen.  [[A winner is you]] when your target responds with a pointless rant about those who are different.

'''Favorite bands'''

*Rush
*Tool
*Pink Floyd
*Radiohead
*The Jimi Hendrix Experience
*Any other supposed [[boring|"deep thinking man's music"]]

== The Encyclopedia ==
[[File:Jimmorrison ghost.jpg|thumb|Brett Meisner being haunted by Jim Morrison's ghost]]
{{quote|You didn't know that [[shit nobody cares about|Led Zepplin was technically metal]]? I'm going to kill you in your sleep.}}

The Encyclopedia will consider you the worst pile of dog shit if you can't name what color shirt (insert classic rock band member here) was wearing in 1973. This type of person has no life or talent, so they instead learn all they can about rock bands in order to hold this petty and useless knowledge over others. If you can't name all the members of Pink Floyd off of the top of your head, the Encyclopedia will [[cream]] himself. The [[metal]] elitists of this variety are possibly the worst. They will go apeshit if you get any of your metal "subgenres" even the slightest bit mixed up, or if you haven't heard of every shitty little [[black metal]] band from [[Lithuania]] that never sold more than 8 copies of their crappy self produced EP. The truly ironic thing about the  Encyclopedia is that they never actually have any talent or credibility themselves, nor do they even have any ''real'' musical knowledge(theory, songwriting, industry experience, etc) and [[lol|they stupidly believe that being able to name 5000 shitty little death metal bands that nobody has ever heard of, or being to name every member of Pink Floyd's favorite breakfast cereal somehow counts as "musical knowledge."]]

* The Encyclopedia exists among fandom of all musical genres, so it really just depends on the genre. Whatever type of fandom you are looking at though, rest assured that The Encyclopedia will happily make his presence known.

===Brett Meisner===

An example of this kind of faggotry was the [[unwarranted self-importance|"self-proclaimed rock critic"]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Meisner Brett Meisner]. While he thought of himself as [[awesome]], he was actually just a 40 something year old [[troll]] looking for attention. He wanted everyone to take him seriously, despite creating several [[unfunny]] websites including [http://www.rockandrollbadboy.com/ his infamous site, ''Rock and Roll Bad Boy''] site (check out it's pointless "Rock Trivia" section for lulz) and the lesser known [[Shit nobody cares about|''Kiss Burger'' and "CSI:CSNY"]]. [[lie|He also has written many articles for ''Rolling Stone'' and ''Spin'' and was in talks with VH1 to get his own show, which was canceled at last minute]]. [http://www.youtube.com/user/BrettMeisner But at least he has JewTube]! Probably his best known claim to fame is encountering the ghost of Jim Morrison and blaming the ghost for all his misfortunes, he claimed to have defeated the ghost of "The Lizard King" in a half-hour special which supposedly aired on [[Faux News|Fox]]. Meisner expired on September 10, 2010 (according to some "friends").

== The Fanboy ==
[[Image:L_d88f13307302bcf25541452d2b2992d8.jpg|thumb|right|A fanboy so dedicated to his favourite band he gets a tattoo of their logo in the form of a squished pop tart on his arm.]]
{{quote|Shit bands for life!}}

Unlike the Thinker or Guitar God, the Fanboy is actually aware of the current state of popular music.  Unlike the others, most fanboys can't even pretend to be discerning or [[intelligent]].  Korn, [[Linkin Park]], and most other shitty bands have their share of rabid fanboys, but the most infamous of all are the [[Juggalo]]s.

'''Easy Steps to Lulz''':
# First, enter the following message
#* ''That band sucks''
# Do something productive in another window or [[IRL]] for any period of time.
# Save a log or [[screencap|screen grab]] of the ensuing [[drama]].
# Upload to [[LiveJournal]] or [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].
# ????
# [[LULZ]]!

'''Favorite bands'''

*[[ICP]]
*Linkin Park
*Korn
*Twizted
*Creed
*Disturbed
*[[Tool]]
*[[Nickelback]]
*Any other shitty corporate [[jewish]] band made solely for exploiting dumbasses and making tons of money.(Hey, considering how popular most of these bands are, ''somebody'' must be buying the records, right? [[You|Now you know who buys them.]])

== The Black Metal Elitist ==
{{quote|[[Christfag|Impaled Nazarene]] and [[moonspeak|Abhor(Ita)]] are so heavy.  [[ignorant|You don't even know]].  What is [[Slayer]]?}}

[[Image:Photo 844.jpg|thumb|right|Typical Black Metal Elitist. Pictured with sweatshirt and patches of bands you've never heard of.]]

Easily the most pretentious of the Musical Elitist Bastards.  Known for [[Loser|pseudo]]-[[Philosophy|nihilist]] and [[Necrophilia|misanthropic behavior]], they judge their music by how [[Gay|"tr00"]] it is.  If more than 5 people have heard of, or like the band, they will shoot it down as [[Blowjob|sold-out]].  Will constantly quote Varg Vikernes or Gaahl, and talk about how gr1m it was when the singer from Mayhem became [[an hero]].  Most Black Metal Elitists are in fact [[English is not my native language|Scandinavians]] and therefore [[Terrorist|Socialists]].

If you see someone in cargo pants, combat boots, and a Xasthur, Burzum or Darkthrone memorabilia, chances are you've got a black metal elitist.

<s> 
*[[sellout|Emperor]] 
*[[sellout|Watain]]
*[[sellout|Nokturnal Mortum]]
*[[sellout|Dark Throne]]
*[[sellout|Dimmu Borgir]]</s>
*Inaccurate, as most of those are way too mainstream. [[Fact|In actuality, to most Black metal elitists, if the band has sold more than 13 copies of their shitty record, they are automatically "sell outs" or "posers" by default.]] Most Black Metal elitists only listen to the most [[kvlt]] of kvlt shit bands from [[Lithuania]] that no more than 3 people have ever heard of.

== The Obscure Music Listener ==
{{quote|[[Radiohead|OK Computer]] the best album of 1997? Maybe if you're a mainstream [[sellout|sell-out]]. The best album of 1997 was [[Fact|clearly]] The Conet Project.}}

Lacking any ability to discern good music from bad music, the obscure music listener hides his weakness by searching out [[Shit nobody cares about|albums that approximately 5 other people in the world have heard]] and claiming that each album is [[OMG|THE BEST SHIT EVER]]. It doesn't matter if the album has any redeeming musical value; in fact, it could be nothing but [[sick fuck|recordings of people taking shits on their cats]]. The obscure music elitist will still claim it is the [[Lies|greatest album ever]] and [[Pwn|destroys]] any album you listen to that sold [[At least 100|more than 500]] copies.

The obscure music listener's [[Faggotry|strength]] lies in his ability to confound his opponents by bringing up albums [[noone|no one]] has ever heard, thus making it impossible to [[Prove me wrong|prove him wrong]] unless you actually go and listen to them. Of course, the albums are often so [[Boring|mind-numbingly dull]] that you will never actually make it through them, allowing him to claim that you [[Doing it wrong|didn't give it a chance]].

If you are ever faced with an obscure music listener, simply ask him, "If it's so good, how come I've never heard of it?" This is [[George Zimmer|guaranteed]] to [[troll]] every obscure music listener 100% of the time.

'''Favorite bands'''

*Anything that is so amazingly shitty that you will probably only find it in the bargain bins at Goodwill ''if'' you're lucky.

== The [[E-Penis]] Stroker ==
{{quote|I see from your [[Nerd|RateYourMusic]] account that you have only rated [[no more than 99|50]] albums. I think before you start having [[opinion|opinions]] on music, you should [[Drugs|expand your horizons]] a bit.}}

The E-Penis Stroker has logged [[OVER 9000|5 million]] plays on [[Last.FM]] and wants to show the whole world. He considers anyone with a smaller [[e-penis]] than him to be musically inferior. They typically come in two varieties: RateYourMusic-fags and Last.FM-fags. The RateYourMusic fags don't realize some people have [[Fap|other things to do]] [[OTI|on the Internet]] besides give albums meaningless ratings on a 5-point scale. The Last.FM fags are just [[liars]] who leave music on their computer all day and all night, even while sleeping, in order to increase their [[Fail|playcount]].

Due to the fact that their music listening is primarily centered on the [[Internets]], E-Penis Strokers have seen many types of trolling before and are often immune to all but the most carefully-crafted trolls. A common [[noob]] mistake is to try to troll them by accusing them of being [[basement-dwelling]] faggots (which they probably are). A flame might go something like this:
* "In order to have that many plays on last.fm you must be sitting around listening to music 24/7. Go outside you fucking loser."
* "If I ever spent that much time cataloging, rating and reviewing the music in my collection I'd [[suicide|kill myself]]. Just listen to the music and enjoy it."

Occasionally this will work, and you might get a really trollable excuse like "I have [[Asperger's Syndrome]] so I can't just go out and have a life like you can." However, most basement-dwellers (including E-Penis Strokers) have long acknowledged the fact that they just [[fail]] at life and are not upset by having it pointed out.

The best way to turn an E-Penis Stroker into your personal [[lolcow]] is to accuse him of [[lying]] about how much music he actually listens to. Some good starting flames:
* "I bet you didn't even listen to all the albums you rated."
* "I bet you just listened to each of those albums 1 time and then rated it."

The E-Penis Stroker will immediately get defensive of the [[cock|e-cock]] he's pumped so hard to enlarge. It is, after all, [[truth|the only significant work he's ever accomplished]]. For maximum effectiveness, you can combine the two aforementioned trolls, like so:
* "I bet you leave your [[Last.FM]] on even when you're not there just to increase your e-penis size, you fucking loser."

== The Classic Rock Faggot ==
{{Quote|All music made after 1993 is terrible. Tool will never come close to having the heart and soul that [[AC/DC]] had.}} 

Do you think modern music just doesn't have the same heart as classic rock did? Do you listen to nothing but classic rock radio? Do you get really angry when modern bands cover classic rock songs? Then you just might be a Classic Rock Faggot. 

One of the worst types of music elitists, Classic Rock Faggots have only one criteria for determining whether or not something is good: it had to have been made [[At least 100 years ago|at least 20 years ago]]. 

Classic Rock Faggots, like all music elitists, have completely rationalized why they think the way they do. Classic rock, you see, didn't have these [[Elton John|faggot singers]] who whine about how their [[daddy]] wasn't there for them, sing [[The Beatles|emotionless love songs]] or talk about [[AC/DC|banging bitches]] and [[Jimi Hendrix|shooting people]]. No, back in the classic rock days, it was [[Tenacious D|all about the rock]] and they didn't rely on the [[Boston|studio to sound good]]. Today's music, on the other hand, is [[The Monkees|corporate-sponsored crap put together by marketing teams]] with [[Iron Maiden|songs that all sound the same]].

The best way to deal with a Classic Rock Faggot is to walk away from the bike show or county fair you met him at. There is a rare occasion when they show up on the Internet, however, and great [[lulz]] can be had by telling them [[The Rolling Stones|the Stones]] suck. You need not provide any explanation; just keep repeating that they suck in as many ways as you can think of and watch the [[lulz|pages]] scroll by.

== The Electro Faggot ==

{{quote|House? Please, I don't listen to that shit. I won't even go into a club that doesn't play dirty electro dubstep break beat drum and bass influenced psy-trance disco tech-house.}}

The Electro Faggot is pretty much the mirror image of a Classic Rock Faggot. The same, but backwards. For you see, the Electro Faggot has rationalised the thought that any music made before 1995 is complete and utter bullshit. In fact, some will go as far as to say that any band that actually has a drummer is [[Hippy|living in the past, man]]. These fuckers can be found in basement clubs doing the Melbourne Shuffle to hardstyle, dubstep and DnB, seeing as how Ministry of Sound made House, Tech and Trance "WAYYYY TOO COMMERCIAL, BRO".

You can find these losers all over the internet, but no where in such abundance as http://www.soundcloud.com. Soundcloud offers these faggots an electro-[[Facebook]], where they can upload their re-mixes, re-edits, re-mashes and generally be re-tards.
