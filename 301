This is where [[MySpace]] [[retard]]s and [[AOL]] [[retards]] intersect. Sporting the most homosexual schema ever witnessed by internets users, this site attracts the  most retarded users from both demographics and puts them together in a sort of 'sandbox' where they [http://www.aimgirl.com/talk/index.php?showtopic=41012| can fling their sheer stupidity around like some sort of weapon, wielded against the internets at large]. Truly abhorrent. It is shocking that they are able to actually register on a forum website without assistance from someone who was shaken less frequently as an infant. [http://www.aimgirl.com/talk/index.php?showtopic=40918| Spamming] is one way you might try trolling such a forum, as apparently it will be new and shocking to their [[pedophilia|underage]] minds, although crapflooding shock images is suggested, lest they pre-emptively destroy your brain with their [[insane]]ly [[ghey]] pink hearts all over your screen and mind-numbingly incoherent posts. [[Some argue|Some say]] that [[4chan|/b/]] was going to flood the forums, but were [[owned]] by the [[retard]] shield surrounding the site, penetrable only by an army of [[GNAA|gayniggers]] who had closed their eyes ahead of time and were able to [[crapflood]] without being turned to stone.
