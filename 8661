Unblock
'''Unblocking''' is the administrator's equivalent of [[troll's remorse]]. But then again, they're all elitist snobs, and are no less worthy of the coveted title of "Troll" than [[WoW]] or [[MONGO]].

Unblocking requires [[Runescape|lvl 40 mining and lvl 30 strength]].

==Unblocking on ED==
#See [[lie|Template:Unblock]]
#Add '''<nowiki>{{unblock|(and state your reason here)}}</nowiki>'''.
#Oh, banned users can't edit their talk pages here.  Sorry. :(

==Unblocking on [[forum]] websites==
No hope rests here. Just create a new sockpuppet and continue trolling. Get a few friends together for a [[DDoS]] attacks to avenge your fallen account!

==Unblocking on Wikipedia==
The best method is to do fuckin' nothing. Get a sockpuppet, lay low for a while, and then enact your revenge upon Wikipedia by [[spam]]ming, moving pages, making personal attacks, and anything else that is more enjoyable than adding to a directionless cesspool of [[facts]].

For great [[lulz]].
