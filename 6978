'''[[Wetback|Ricardo Lopez]]''', also known as the "[[Björk]] [[stalker]]", was an [[IRL]] [[troll]] who was known for [[stalker|stalking]] the [[THE_BEST|wonderful]] [[screamo|singer]] [[Björk]], and eventually becoming [[an hero]] for his [[Cunt|sweetheart]]. Lopez was one of the very first [[Vlogger|Vloggers]] in history, constantly making lulzy videos about [[fun|shit going on in his life]], and his love for Björk, whom he wished to torture for her [[painful|incredibly shitty]] singing and [[sick fuck|his own sexual pleasure]]. While many people wished to do the same thing to her, Ricardo was the first to stand up and [[epic fail|try to]], though his efforts went to [[fail|waste]] when the [[cops|pigs]] [[Lulz_killer|discovered, and intercepted the acid-spraying bomb he sent her]] after watching the video he had [[epic_win|taped of his suicide.]] Ricardo is also notable for being [[insane]] as fuck. Some examples are:


1. [[Skinhead|Shaving his head.]]

2. [[Face-painter|Painting his face.]]

3. Walking around naked while [[fat]].

4. [[Chris-Chan|Showing off your moobs and dancing.]]

5. [[Fail|Shooting yourself in the head over Björk.]] 

6. [[Batshit_Insane|Giving a shit about Björk.]]

One more [[fatass]] has [[awesome|kicked the bucket]] as a failure.


He can build an acid bomb but can't an hero properly, [[retard|even in suicide he fails]].



==Aftermath==

[[Image:Cwp bjork.jpg|thumb|"He did what?...lulz"]]

It was later found out that the reason he killed himself and [[win|attempted killing Björk]] was not because of her [[pain|shit music]] or [[derp|weird looks]], but because she was engaged to some black person, which made poor Ricardo [[U_MAD|mad]]. He of course, having [[Fucking_Magnets|no sense of reality]] before [[You|committing suicide]], and not realizing that [[truth|stalkers never get any pussy]], wanted her dead for her betrayal. Even more lulz were had when his tapes were released onto the internets by the fiancé [[for great justice]].
