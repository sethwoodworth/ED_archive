[[Iraq]] is the [[Islamic]] shithole desert everyone loves; home to races like the [[republican|freetard]]s, [[sand people]], [[oil|blackwater]] and [[more]].

== Start here ==
In 2003, [[George Bush]] got [[butthurt]] after being taunted by the Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]], who then invaded and occupied [[Babylon|Boobylon]], raped the [[U.S.]] [[economy]], and sought control of Iraq's vast deposits of [[Vespene gas|oil]], as well as the [[profit]]able schoolhouse-painting industry (known among [[Expert|insiders]] simply as "the biz"). Iraq would also have served as a base for a future [[trolling|attack]] on [[Iran]], but [[Donald Rumsfeld|Donald Rumsfailed]] fucked it all up.

== Operation Oilraqi Faildumb ==
Iraq was the victim of a massively-homicidal failed oil and gas exploration (Operation Oilraqi Faildumb). Test wells were drilled into the skulls of 150,000 hapless sand-niggers with M16 [[rifle]]s. The brown ones were liberated from the tyranny of mineral [[wealth]] a second time because [[World War I|War Wars I]] failed to steal enough. This is what Iraqi Freetards call "liberation": bombing to death a mountain of people that did nothing to them, kicking in survivors’ doors every night for a decade, shutting off their power and water and making them live knee-deep in their own [[shit]] and trash and shooting to death anyone that doesn’t immediately stop at occupation road blocks that are ten feet apart. Criminally-insane oil executive [[Dick Cheney]] helped Iraqi Freetards understand that when we drop bombs on cities it's always out of [[love]].
 
This is the “[[bullshit|Bush Doctrine]]:” if you drop enough bombs on the brown’ens eventually they is [[Christians]], roses and American flags sprout from their buttocks and they love you. When rag-heads do it they call it [[Jihad]] but we have uniforms so it’s different. 

Operation Oilraqi Faildumb was also the dumbest and least successful military maneuver since the Maginot Line or ever. Team [[Neocon]] World Police spent a trillion dollars invading a country with no military and no weapons of even minimal destruction and lost to starving peons with counterfeit AKs and no [[electricity]]. Even the neocons admitted the [[Special Olympics]] War Games had been a failure after participants knocked over every hurdle. Asked how the most expensive gas-station robbery in history had gone so badly, W replied: "Anyone that don’t sig heil Iraqi Freedumb is [[Democrat|from Nigger Town and hates freedom]] and the terrorises win. [[Derp]] terrorizers freedumb ‘Murka derp derp.”

The Coalition of the Willing to [[Kill]] Brown People for [[Money]] contained token [[England|Lobster-Backs]] and [[Poland|other]] [[Georgia|irrelevant]] [[South Korea|nationalities]] but no one cared. The [[United Kingdom]]'s strategy of dropping tons of bad teeth from a formation of bombers was a failure and thankfully they were frequently the victims of [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|friendly fire]]. The [[Australians]] were predictably deported for petty [[theft]] and other [[alcohol]]-related crimes.  

Freedumb isn’t free of course and many [[leftards]] don’t understand Iraqi Freedumb was more about stealing [[gold]] from [[Kentucky|Fort Knox]] than stealing oil. Instead of going down to [[Wal-mart]] and buying [[Batman]] [[Halloween]] costumes and hunting rifles with their own money, the [[Government|Neocon Republicommunist LeftRight]] stole [[over 9000|$1,000,000,000,000+]] from American taxpayers at IRS gun point. Evil [[Jews]] and their [[prostitutes]] were mostly responsible for Operation Evil Penis Freedumb.

== History ==
[[Image:MarioAndArab.JPG|thumb|Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki (right) confers with unidentified Coalition soldier.]]

Iraq was invented [[last Thursday]] because American teenagers needed a place to party and rape [[Jailbait|underage girls]] after being denied access to such locales as Panama City, [[Florida]] and Padre Island in [[Texas]]. Also, there are far fewer seagulls stealing your Cheetos in Iraq than in them other places. 

[[Image:Danrather.jpg|thumb|[[Dan Rather]], the mastermind behind Operation Oilraqi Freedumb.]]
Iraq began to exist independently as soon as everyone realized that the [[Turkey|Ottoman Empire]] was never a real country at all, sending [[Dan Rather]] down in flames after his practice of reporting "live on location" from a location which didn't exist was thus revealed.

If [[you]] disagree with [[Manifest Destiny|Operation Iraqi Freedom]], you are either a [[terrorist]], an [[Why do you hate America?|America-hating]] [[liberal]], or worse, [[French]]. If you agree, you are a true [[American]], probably [[Christian]], probably [[rich]], and definitely hire [[Mexicans|migrant labor]].

20 [[percent]] of all available bandwidth on the [[Internets]] is taken up by people arguing about Iraq (the other 80% is devoted to [[pr0n]]). On one side you have [[fat-fuck]] [[rednecks]] waving flags, and on the other you have [[hippies]] smoking [[pot]]. The dialogue is never intelligent, informed, or very amusing; that is until a [[flame war]] erupts, and then it is GAME ON!

== List of Iraq Faggotry ==

*Invasion of [[Kuwait]] (Cause only America has the right to invade - duh!) 
*[[9/11]] (Saddam and [[Osama]] are both Muslim, 'nuff said!) 
*Assasination of [[John F. Kennedy]] (Why not, might as well pin that on Saddam!)
*The sinking of the [[Titanic]] (Iraq is hot, and it stole the heat from the iceberg that sank the Titanic - elementary my dear Watson!)
*The [[Exploding Whale|Hindenburg explosion]] ([[Balloonpoppop|Self Explanatory]]!) 
*[[Pearl Harbor]] (All dem [[Azns]] look alike!) 
*The [[Holocaust]] (Indeed, both [[Hitler]] and Saddam had the 'stache!) 
*[[Boston]] Massacre (Boston Massacre/Falluhaj Massacre, [[Ireland|Potato'/Pota'to]] - elementary!) 
*Nuclear bombing of [[Hiroshima]] and Nagasaki ([[Japan]] joined the Coalition for a reason!)
*The invasion of Iraq by the United States (Self explanatory, nothing the U.S. does is America's Fault, and Iraq's the only other country left!)

== War of TERRAH!! ==

Fighting the War on Terror by invading Iraq is the equivalent of sticking some [[1guy1jar|rusty syringes and a live grenade up your asshole]] to combat an upset stomach.

THIS IS AN ACCURATE COMPARISON

==Present-Day Iraq==
[[Image:Laptop_princeharrysafe_300x250.gif|thumb|[[Shit nobody cares about|Lol noone cares]]]]
[[Last Thursday]], [[Americunt|America]] elected [[President Barack Hussein Obama|a new president]] who promised to [[GTFO|take the military out of the Persian Gulf]]. Since then, the public's [[ADHD|attention has been refocused]] to [[moar]] [[Swine Flu|important]] [[Conficker|things]]. [[Logic|Due to these happenings]], Iraq remains the same [[shithole]] that America left it. [[Some Argue]] that [[Fact|Iraq is actually worse now]] than when America [[rape|invaded]] it, but most are just [[attention whores]] trying to stir up [[drama]].

==Praise for Iraq==

"I believe that the government that governs best is the government that governs least, and by these standards we have established an exemplary government in Iraq" - [[Stephen Colbert]], praising [[W]] at the White House Correspondence Dinner. 

"The Earth is overpopulated, thank you for removing that million!" - [[Environmentalists]] praising Iraq. 

"No Human Rights violations took place at Fallujah. The Bombs dropped were smart, nice & fluffy" - Human Rights Watch praising the Liberation!

"Thank you for handing Iraq over to us on a silver platter, while tying up the infidel army in a [[Quagmire]]" - [[Ahmadinejad]]'s praise for [[W]]'s actions in Iraq. 

"Thank you for letting us raep you at the pump, while our allies at Blackwater raep Iraq girls; it is important to exchange feelings of hurt in cultural exchanges" - Oil Companies. (Military needs oil, Iraq produces less oil due to warfare. [[capitalism|As demand goes up and supply goes down, price goes up]], that's economics [[101]].)
