[[Image:Notinthecircle.jpg|thumb|What you'll find in a basement]]

A [[basement]] is typically the underground level of a structure, such as a [[house]]. Your average domestic basement is usually used as a way to hide and store large and unneeded things around the house like old and useless junk for either storage or final resting place. So now you know why your mom lets you live in her basement. Other uses may include the following: Drug lab, the place to kill your victims, occult and taboo acts like disemboweling or eating a man alive, your very own church for your cult and other acts you wouldn't want those pesky neighbors to see or hear.
