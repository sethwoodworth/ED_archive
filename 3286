Gentrification
{{moar|everything, but it's a good start}}

Gentrification is what happens when hipsters decide to move back into the city to be "cool" and "edgy." Crime rates go down, and the city actually somewhat revives economically as porch monkeys get pushed out, albeit by a bunch of snobby kids who are using daddy's money to move out. Despite the politically correct screaming that it's not fair for prices to increase on rent to the point that tenants can't afford it (non-fixed rate mortgage loans, anyone?), they often forget that these city homes have been kept unusually low in price because everyone who used to live in the city left during white flight and now lives in suburbia and gated communities.

This urban revival is actually more eco-friendly, and a return to form for people, sort of setting the record back to what it was before white flight. Whether this is because people have learned to embrace the African within us all, or because they're just a bunch of retarded hipsters.
