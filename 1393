'''Ceiling Cat''' refers to a photographic image of a concerned-looking cat whose head appears poking out through a hole in somebody's ceiling. This image has become universally recognized by all denizens of the [[Tubes]] as a sign of wonder, an icon of fear, and a source of [[lulz]]. 

In the mythos of [[meme]]dom, Ceiling Cat is the analog of [[God]].

==Mythology and Powers==
Ceiling Cat is omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, and omnivorous. (See: [[OM NOM NOM NOM|om nom nom nom]].) He is known to enter houses and poke his head through holes in the ceiling to watch people [[masturbate]]. If there's no hole in your ceiling,[[guro| he'll make one]]. Some consider this to be an [[Patriot Act|invasion of privacy]], but who are we to question Ceiling Cat? 

Ceiling Cat is benevolent, but just. If he does not approve of something, he is known to destroy entire planets with his [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|deadly eye lazers]], which is why [[noone]] complains.


----
'''PROTIP:''' Ceiling Cat can never be defeated. He may, however, be temporarily defied. And as a result, you will be defiled. As he is deified.

==The Prophecy==
Long ago, Ceiling Cat's favorite kitten, Lightcat, rebelled against Ceiling Cat. Seeking to become Top Cat, Lightcat recruited one third of the cats in Cat Heaven and attempted to drive C.C. out. Of course, he was immediately [[pwned]] by Ceiling Cat, who cast him out of Cat Heaven (located somewhere in the Ceiling) and into Cat Hell (located somewhere in the Basement). Thus chastised, Lightcat became one with the darkness; assuming the name Basement Cat, he and his fallen feline followers (known as Devil Cats) took on a new mission: to drag as many cats as they could down with them.

It is said that someday Ceiling Cat and Basement Cat will meet in final battle. This day will come at the end of time itself and should not be confused with [[Catnarok]], which is a cyclical "cleansing of the cosmic litterbox" and not a final apocalypse. At the end, the prophecy says, all beings (human and feline) will be judged by Ceiling Cat on their actions towards others. People who have been mean to cats will be told to [[GTFO]] and will dwell in the darkness below with Basement Cat for all time. Those who have shown kindness to cats (and humans) will live on in bliss in Cat Heaven.
