[[YouTube Vigilantes]] (yTv, not to be confused with '''Youth TeleVision''') are a group of middle-aged [[pedophile]]s who spend hours a day bitching and moaning about [[haters]] on [[YouTube]], trying to dig up their [[docs|private info]] so that the [[Youtube Street Team]] (led by [[Damien Estreich]] who deposed [[Argent009]]) can sweep in to perform [[rape|street]] [[murder|justice]].

== Hypocrisy ==
About the only thing the YouTube Vigilantes actually ''do'' is elevate hypocrisy to an art form.

=== Spam ===
[[Image:Ytv-lonely.jpg|thumb|right|The only comments are all [[CircaRigel]] [[sockpuppet]]s. lol]]
The YouTube Vigilantes claim to be against spam as well as hate. They show this by spamming hateful comments on the profile of anyone who dares question them or disagree with them. Or anyone who might have at some point said something they disagree with, whether or not that person was actually aware of the YTV. 

== The Promised Land ==
The YouTube Vigilantes claim to have left and gone to [[The Promised Land]]. Someone forgot to tell their sockpuppets. 

We also don't mention how incredibly lame it is to call yourself a "YouTube" vigilante when the site you are on is LiveVideo. We assume that eventually they will figure it out and until then, we lol.

==New Ruin: The VigilantOne Rebellion==

[[Last Thursday]] the YouTube Vigilantes member known as "[[vigilantOne]]" went rogue. He replaced his standard YTV background ([[gay|a purple peace sign with turtles and dolphins]]) with a much edgier [[nerd|Star Wars]] one to show that he meant [[serious business]]. He made a series of lulzy videos that accused members of [[YouTube]], [[ED]], and the [[YTYC]] of various things. The content of his videos can best be summarized as, "Neener, neener, neener, _____ is a _____!!!"

While the [[YTYC]] was doing their datamining on the identity of vigilantOne, a diversion video was put up. All signs were pointing to [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=noscriptsV2 noscriptsV2], but the data had to be checked and double-checked before they went all the way live with that info.

<center>(Irish282 had this video removed, but it's <s>[http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=7ae_1182845640 mirrored here].)</s></center>

[[Image:New_YTV_logo.JPG|thumb|Proposed revision for the YTV logo]]
This angered vigilantOne, and he began producing videos at rate of one per day. He couldn't maintain this pace, and they declined further and further in quality to the point where his final one consisted of cucumbers and sausages. His [[faggotry]] was so embarrassing to the YTVigilantes, that they threatened to reveal his [[powerword]] unless he suicided immediately. He obliged.

Ashamed and disgusted over the actions of her former colleague, [[CircaRigel]] resigned from the YTV. She vowed to fight on alone, but to never wear the purple background again.

After seeing how little control the YTVigilantes had over their members, HonEDLolington decided it was time for a change. A corporate takeover was announced. All policing and pedo-hunting on [[YouTube]] would now be done by the [[YTYC]], and the purple logo was absorbed until it could be revamped.

==YTV [[Pwned]]==
Sometime in August of 2007, the [[YouTube]] group [[forum]] for the YTV went through some puzzling changes. Members began bailing out in droves. Soon after that the group itself was deleted.

The only clue to what happened comes from this panicked bulletin posted by [[Irish282]]:
[[Image:YTVpwned.JPG|frame|center|lewl]]

[[Some argue]] that this was no [[hack]] job at all, but merely an attempt by Irish282 to cover his tracks regarding his pedophiliac activities. In any event, it was noted that children rejoiced and danced and sang and flew kites next to chocolate rivers upon hearing about the demise of the YouTube Vigilantes.

==YTV [[2.0]] - Facta Non Verba==
