'''Plagiarism''' refers to the use of another's [[internets|information]], [[language]], or [[poetry|writing]], when done without proper acknowledgment of the original [[sauce|source]]. Essential to an act of plagiarism is an element of [[government|dishonesty]] in attempting to pass off the plagiarized work as original. Contrary to the claims of many a [[FurAffinity|FurAffinity]] and [[deviantART|deviantART]] "artists", plagiarism is not necessarily the same as [[copyright infringement]], which occurs when one violates [[Internet Law|copyright law]]. Like most terms from the area of [[retard|intellectual property]], ''plagiarism'' is a concept of the [[at least 100 years ago|modern age]] and not really applicable to [[at least 100 years ago|medieval]] or [[at least 100 years ago|ancient]] works. An example of plagiarism would be copying this definition and pasting straight into a report without giving any citation.[1]

<b>pla·gia·rism</b> <i>n.</i>
# a piece of writing that has been copied from someone else and is presented as being your own work
# the act of plagiarizing; taking someone's words or ideas as if they were your own
[syn: plagiarization, plagiarisation, [[pirate|piracy]]]

'''The Consequences <i>of getting caught</i> Plagiarizing'''
# You lose your wife
# You lose your job
# You lose your closest friends and/or relatives
# You do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars
# You will get a 0 on your assignment and possible further action.


==Plagiarism and Academics==
Most [[college|colleges, universities,]] and other institutions of learning will tell you that [[lie|plagiarism is evil]] and will make you [[shit|read handouts]] every semester on how they will ream you for it. However, if you ask any teacher of real science ([[E-Psychiatrist|psych and sociology students]], you can ask your math/physics/chem teacher) about how they got tenure and they will let you in on this well kept secret. [[truth|Plagiarism is your dumb ass's one ticket to success.]] So fire up Google and keep friendly tabs on your friend in another grad school's work. Here we consider an example lecture by Harvard Graduate of mathematics (M.A.) and now retired professor[2], Tom Lehrer ([[irony|wherein the uploader claims a copyright over a video composed of stolen pictures and a song they didn't write]]).
