*[http://www.theperfectworld.us/thread.php?id=246&postNum=246 The Tirade Repository]: "Dear Self-Absorbed No Talent Assclown - It may seem to your immature, sexual identity-confused brain that lying and gossiping about your peers to the PTB will somehow elevate you in life. In the grand scheme of things the only person you hurt was yourself. The others know that. They know you are merely a speck on their beaches and this time is but a fleeting second in their lives. You, however, remain well ensconced in the delusion that any of this matters. The smackdown life has waiting for you is of biblical proportions."
