'''''Toontown''''' is the most [[gay|badass]] [[MMORPG]] a [[roleplayer]] could ask for. You play as a [[furry]] who, alongside other furries, combats evil robots dressed in suits. If this doesn't sound [[fail|awesome]] enough, you fight them by hurling pies and other slapstick-esque items at their faces. Need more be said? If that's not enough, [[Disney]] is responsible for this abomination of the [[internet]]. Its levels of [[faggotry]] even challenge those of [[Neopets]].

Oh yeah, and you have to '''pay''' to play this [[shit]]. You might as well be given a monthly fee for [[Castration|cutting your balls off]].

The ''Toontown'' tree first sprouted in 2003. Since then, it has grown catastrophically. With more and more updates to the game, more and more children are sucked into the dark void that is Disney's ''Toontown Online''. It can be described best as a horrific monster, similar to ''The Blob''. The more children succumb to this monstrosity, the more powerful it becomes. We can only hope that the internet will one day be rid of this horror for eternity. Unfortunately, we all know that expectation to be approximately as realistic as [[Dianetics]].

* Not to be confused with the Toontown from ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''. This Toontown is much more [[fail]].

==Gameplay==

[[Image:Toontown_VIP.jpg|thumb|A more epic battle has never been witnessed.]]

When the game is first begun, you will create your character just like in any other MMORPG. You choose which [[furry|animal]] you want your character to be, his or her personal appearance, then his or her name.  The most common way to do so is by using Toontown's name generator, the resulting name is never any less elaborate and ridiculously, unnecessarily long than something along the lines of "Queen Happy Dildoshitter The Thirteenth".  Once the character has been created, you are walked through a short tutorial that explains how to play the game:<br>
<br>
1. Select gag (weapon).<br>
2. Enemy's turn.<br>
3. Repeat.<br>
4. You win/lose.<br>
5. Move on to next enemy.<br>
6. Continue from step 1.<br>
<br>
Once the tutorial is completed, you are free to roam Toontown. What you do from then on is not much different from the tutorial itself. However, you may embark upon lengthy and irritating quests which involve killing the same kind of Cog over and over again.  This is just about as much fun as it sounds like.  When you run low on gags, you must play minigames to earn more. Also, if a player "goes sad" (the family friendly term for dying), said player is forced to wander around aimlessly in a safe zone until his/her laff points (the game's health system) have replenished.

===Gag Types===
====Toon-Up====
Toon-Up gags are Toontown's version of healing potions. These gags consist of a flower with which you can molest other toons, a cane for doing Dr. House impressions, and lipstick so you can initiate yiffing. Many toons in need of a toon-up will shout "TOON PLZ" over and over until they inevitably go sad, at which point they will blame anyone in the room. Denying toon-ups is one of many forms of trolling Toontown players that is available. The maximum level toon-up is the high dive, in which your toon becomes self aware and climbs a tall ladder, jumping off at the top in an attempt to commit suicide after realizing what a horrible game he/she is in. This causes great lulz to the other toons, who, knowing you can never escape, laugh harder than at any other toon-up gag.
====Trap====
Despite being a game targeted towards children, trap gags are decidedly violent. They include quicksand pits in which your enemies drown and TNT which can blow a foe's face far, far away. Although they are the only thing that comes close to even a fraction of cool in Toontown, nobody uses trap. The maximum level trap gag calls in Asians to build a railroad track, which, if the enemies step on, instantly sends a fucking train through their fragile robot bodies.
====Lure====
Lure gags must be used after a trap has been set in order for the trap to work. Lure gags include money attached to fishing rods and magnets. One jellybean can be exchanged for a twenty dollar bill, because the gag shop is run by counterfeiters. A lured cog cannot attack, and stands still for several turns contemplating whether it would be better to an hero for falling for a stupid prank, or to get revenge and do penance for its sin of idiocy. The maximum level lure gag is a projector screen with loli displayed, drawing all foes in and distracting them while they fap.
====Sound====
Sound is the ultimate weapon of lulz. The jews at Disney made a gag track that almost always hits, hits all enemies, and does barely any damage. No matter what sound gag you use, if it hits, it WILL draw enemies out of lure. This can be used for trolling in situations with high level enemies, as a bike horn will do about three points of damage and piss off the evil robots enough to cause massive damage to all toons involved. Alternatively, higher level sound gags like the Foghorn are useful for taking out groups of foes, but you can't win at this game, so why bother trying? The maximum level sound gag is an opera singer, whose ugliness and horrifying voice combine to make the foes slit their wrists for 90 damage.
====Throw====
Throw gags miss about as often as they hit. Many toons think they are 1337 because they throw birthday cakes at foes, but everyone knows all the awesome toons creampie their enemies to death. All toons start with this gag, and squirt. The maximum level throw gag is a wedding cake, which makes the bad guys so fat they develop diabetes and fail to get testing supplies in time.
====Squirt====
The other gag toons start with, squirt nearly always hits but does 3/4 the damage of throw gags. To use a squirt attack, a toon first touches his/herself furiously, then cums on the foe. This level of pleasure can be obtained through such means as rubbing flowers on one's genitalia, or even humping a hose, but the most backed up toons release a geyser of body fluids (the maximum level squirt gag).
====Drop====
Drop gags, much like playing Toontown, are useless. They do a ton of damage, but trap is more useful for hard hitting. They miss more often than any other gag type. Most of all, they are used last in a turn, so they don't even get a chance to try hitting their target half the time. However, if you can get a drop to land, it often kills the victim. Drop gags include safes, pianos, and even the maximum level "Toontanic" if you feel like adding more victims to an already horrid tragedy (and you know you do, just like you know you love that Celine Dion song, faggot).

==The Toontown Within Toontown==

[[Image:The_Cogs.jpg|thumb|What has science created?]]

*Toontown is a city populated by [[furry|odd, brightly colored creatures]] referred to as, "Toons".
*Toontown consists of several districts, each of which governed by none other than a member of the cast of ''The Mickey Mouse Show''.
*Toons use a system of currency much different than our own: jellybeans. 
:*Jellybeans, which are necessary for purchasing gags (weapons), are earned by playing minigames repeatedly.
*Gags are the weapons for use against enemies.
:*There is a variety of gags that can be purchased, such as pies or bottles of seltzer water, and more powerful gags are unlocked at later levels.
*The enemies in Toontown consist of robotic entities known as, "Cogs".
:*Cogs wander around Toontown in their endless search for rape victims. A Cog makes no effort whatsoever to harm a Toon unless the Toon in question has made a direct attempt to make physical contact, therefore issuing a life-or-death challenge.
::*Cogs attack by throwing objects at Toons. However, rather than pies, Cogs throw ties and other businessman-related objects.
:::*When a Cog has been defeated, said Cog will explode in a blazing inferno of cogs and gears. Not before entering an [[epilepsy|epileptic seizure]], of course.
::::*Sidewalks are completely safe from Cogs.

==Players==

[[Image:Cheddarbigteeth.gif|thumb|Actual ''Toontown'' player. Note: [[Emo|long hair]]; [[Faggot|happy expression]]; [[No Life|obviously has no friends]].]]

You can only imagine the kind of people who actually spend their money to play this. Due to ''Toontown'''s playful and innocent nature, nobody older than [[13-year-old boy|thirteen]] can be found playing this (with the exception of [[aspies]]). As a result, it's a breeding ground for [[jailbait]].  However, you must be able to prove you know a player IRL to actually attempt direct communication, making sexual harassment but a distant dream.  If you don't know a player IRL, you are forced to select a preset phrase from a list. One can only imagine what manner of badass phrases are allowed to be said in this horrid game.  Had this not been the case, Toontown may have just become the newest [[Habbo Hotel]].

===Fandom===

As you may have assumed, due to the game being entirely populated by [[furry|furries]], some players go so far as to make [[webcomic|webcomics]] and other fan art/fiction about this godawful game. Some are poorly drawn serious comics with horrible storylines, like most webcomics (an example of which can be found [http://eeveefangirl.deviantart.com/art/Dance-76986287 here]).  However, some people are [[sick fuck|sick]] enough to make [[porn|traditional furry works]].
