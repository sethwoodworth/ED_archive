'''Garbage Day''' is a major [[forced meme]] that started [[last Thursday]] when someone posted a picture of Eric Freedman holding a [[gun]] toward a man with a trash can and saying "Garbage day!" before proceeding to shoot him and laughing [[insane|manically]]. The meme comes from a scene in the 80s B-movie [[Cutting|slasher]] "horror" movie [[Shit no one cares about|''Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2'']], and has since gained a [[goth|cult]] following because of its terrible acting. 

==Fame==
Upon watching the scene, people on [[YouTube]] and [[YTMND]] began posting remakes and remixes of it that were purposely just as bad as the film they came from. Some remixes replace Garbage Day! with laundry day, St. Patrick's Day, judgement day and opposite day.

The morons from [[Portal of Evil]] claimed this as their own personal mantra and even have a [[Team Fortress 2]] server named after this abortion. [http://www.game-monitor.mobi/GameServer/42513238/ Go ahead and join] Man-children need only apply.
