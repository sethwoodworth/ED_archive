Damnportlanders
{{ljcomm|user=Damnportlanders}} is a community on LiveJournal that began [[at least 100 years ago]].  It is an extremely populated community with [[over 9000]] [[luser|members]].

==Beginnings==

After the [[mediacrat]] [[drama]], {{ljcomm|user=Portland}} died.  It was a sad day for [[Seattle]]’s little [[bitch]] as where would the fags and emo whores protest the hateful [[George Bush]] and rain?  DamnPortlanders was born.  It’s unknown if the creator (Gelasia) knew about [[teh]] [[unfunny|funny]] of the community name or not.  Get it?  DamnPortlander?  The sorry excuses for human beings on this community refer to themselves as “DPers” therefore giving credit to the whole [[Natalee_Holloway|Double Penetration]] thing.  A lot of people find this funny.  Most people don’t care.

[[Brad]] Fitz, himself, stops by DP, but only to show off how, even though he’s [[sell_out|super rich]], he still wants people [http://community.livejournal.com/damnportlanders/7086569.html to buy him alcohol.]

==The Jameth Effect==

[[Image:pooh.gif|thumb|right|A simple childrens icon that the nazis of Portland felt was too cute and, thus, offensive to their semen stained eyes.]]

[[Jameth]] came to DP one day.  Being the super fag that he is, it was only natural that he wanted to wade, cock deep, into the [[in_the_ass|ass]] of LiveJournal.  His first post, being a seasoned [[dramacrat]], netted 55 comments when he asked where to get Pho.  What the fuck?  Food gets these guys going.  This is what DPers consider serious business.  His [[Harlequin_Ichthyosis_Fetus|harlequin ichthyosis]] icon [http://community.livejournal.com/damnportlanders/7633994.html?thread=90428234#t90428234 started a shit storm] that is still raging.

Portland nearly burned to the ground after the [[furries]] protested and DamnPortlanders had a near riot that resulted in [[A_Plus|A+ drama]] when the mods decided that it was [[NSFW]].  Rules were added by the dictator Gelasia.  She [[poop_drama|shit her pants]] and then promptly banned users for protesting.  Damnportlanders then made multiple posts about the same damn subject.  OMG let’s censor icons!  No wai!  That’s [[censorship]]!  I mean, it has to be censorship.  The word censor is IN “censorship.”  The collective group then cried and [http://community.livejournal.com/damnportlanders/7663403.html exploded in a ball of fire.]

==The bannings of 2006==

Damnportlanders has, historically, sided with the fuck stick [[nazis]] of [[LJ_Abuse]] with users who used icons that were vague and offensive, and then were to be banned.  Good thing that the snark community (funny, right?) existed, otherwise the [[attention whores]] would have no one to complain to about their banning.  Remember that the internet is [[serious business]].  The [[whores]] took to the message boards and cried forever about being banned from their community.  A new community was created as a result, but it has failed to capture the lulz [http://community.livejournal.com/damnportlanders/7687331.html associated with the original.]

==Christian Values==

Gelasia, one of two current mods, is a god fearing [[Christian]] [[psycho]] who believes that there should be freedom of speech and maximum expression, but only if that doesn’t involve her [[religion]].  Her [[List of Terms Referring to a Woman's Period|womanly flow]] happens every day and the excess of blood pouring from her vagina makes her feel like bloody mary, only without the virginal birth to [[Jesus]] thing.  She runs DP like Jesus ran the [[Jews]].  Full of hate and bannination at the drop of a hat.  She also hates if people disagree [http://community.livejournal.com/damnportlanders/7667682.html with her or talk to her.]  When Jameth ruined everything with his icon, all [[offensive]] icons were banned.  However, apparently [[blowjob|cock sucking]] is still [http://community.livejournal.com/damnportlanders/7664899.html good for the kids.]

==How to Piss Off DamnPortlanders==

{{lj|user=CosmicJohn}} ([[Gay]], [[amirite]]?) [[Unwarranted_self-importance| is a big shot on DP.]]  He’s more annoying than [[elgorgo]], but not as famous.  He’s not even [[e-famous]].  Less than nothing.  That’s cosmic and, being the ass rapingly bad community that it is, gelasia decided to [http://community.livejournal.com/damnportlanders/7366735.html make him] [http://community.livejournal.com/damnportlanders/7367282.html a mod.]  Oh the humanity!

[[CosmicJohn]] tried to leach a video file from [[Jameth]] and be cool.  Well, it failed and what happened next was like [[Nixon]].  The [http://cosmicjohn.livejournal.com/325728.html impeachment of 2006.]

Back in the community of [[teh]] suck, he decided to delete some comments from an [[emo]] [[whore]] after he threatened [[suicide]].  The fall out was immediate … people wanted to revolt and [http://community.livejournal.com/damnportlanders/7450949.html overthrow the new mod.]

Cosmic laid low for a while after the great suicide [[debate]] of 2006.  Being the demon spawn of satan and jameth, though, he didn’t believe in Jesus.  He also refused to be saved and wrote about that [[shit]] in his LJ.  Posting whore, much?  Right.  He made a post about some movie with that guy who had [[AIDS]] and sued his lawyer friend and gelasia [http://cosmicjohn.livejournal.com/329579.html freaked] the [http://cosmicjohn.livejournal.com/329872.html fuck out.]

[[Image:Banning.jpg|thumb|right|Being the understanding person that she is, Gelasia finally had enough and dropped the ban hammer.  DP [[Pwned]]!]]
