Etc
__NOTOC__

'''Etc.'' is an abbreviation for the [[Latin]] ''et cetera'', meaning ''and a bunch of other shit''.

Etc. is most often used in arguments - particularly [[OTI]] arguments - in place of legitimate supporting evidence. People who like to argue, but are too [[lazy]] to actually do any [[research]], often use "etc" as well as "[[whatever]]" as the fundamental basis of their argument.
