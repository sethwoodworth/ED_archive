<b>David Vitter</b> is a [[politician]] from the state of [[Louisiana|Loser-ana]]. Elected to the Senate [[at least 100]] years ago, he was well-known as a [[Christian]] [[Conservative]] who championed [[hookers and blow|family values]]. That is, until some [[IRL troll]]s working for [[The Man]] found his name in a brothel madam's [[friends list]] (she became [[an hero]] [[Last Thursday]] btw) and discovered that Senator Family Values himself thoroughly enjoyed [[hookers and blow]] when not campaigning on the importance of morality and chastity.

To add to the [[lulz]], [[some argue]] that Vitter's indulgence in [[whores]] also involved a disturbing streak of [[infantilism]], and that he very much enjoyed wearing diapers during his depraved sexual escapades.

These revelations have been especially damaging to the candidacy of Vitter's closet butt-buddy,  [[Rudy Giuliani]], as the former mayor of [[New York]] had become [[BFF]] with him to appeal to the [[Ass|Moral Majority]]. Seeing as how Giuliani's image was already tainted among conservatives by [[Shemale|cross-dressing]] and [[Lemonparty|living with two gheys]], his campaign is currently headed for epic [[fail]] now that his potential running mate has been exposed as a [[sick fuck]].

Will [[KKK|South Carolina]] Senator [[Hal Turner|Jim DeMint]] be next? 

<blockquote>Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), approached by a group of reporters outside the lunch, offered an unexpected defense. “All of us have to look at it and say that we could be next,” he said in answer to a Vitter question. “We all think that we’re not vulnerable to something like that happening, but the fact is this can be a very lonely and isolating place.</blockquote> -- Washington Post, 11 July 2007
