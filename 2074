Dave Eggers
{{spoilers|text= both his folks die within the first hundred pages!}}
 
[[Image:Eggers_with_eggs.JPG|thumb|left|Eggers on his face]]
Slang for pretentious white [[asshole]] who is self-conscious about the ironic and detached way he views the world yet raves on ... and on ... and on ... about seriousness of viewpoint. 

==Eggered==

<!--Dave Eggers sucks-->
;egger: egger, eggered, eggering
Eggering is what rich kids do when they grow up, move out of their parents' houses, and decide to sit around and talk about how great they are being "artists" or "writers" since they never have to worry about getting real jobs. 
Eggered refers to the [[vomit|rotten feeling]] the reader has after ploughing through his [[Poop|''magnum opus'']], as in 
''Shit, dude, I've been seriously eggered.'' 
"To egger" refers to extreme emotional manipulation; ''I don't care about anyone in my family, but some of them are dead, won't you fuck me dude?'' is a prime example.
<!--Not mentioning You Shall Know Our Velocity, How We are Hungry, or What is the What is crucial.-->

==[[OMG]] He Published His [[Diarrhea]]==
[[Image:Eggers_heartbreaking_genius_staggering.JPG|thumb|right|The cover of the book<!--Parody of the cover for A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius-->]]
Eggers swindled readers around the world with the publication of his cynical first novel, ''A Staggeringly Shallow Work of Heavy-Handedly Self-Promoting Gibberish''.  The book, part megalomaniacal rant, part maudlin confessional, and shameless self-promotion throughout, immediately established the Lake Forest native as one of the most noted con artists of his generation.  

===Plot===

The plot in a nutshell follows.

''Both my parents died tragically in quick succession. I give many examples intended to show that I must be the most sensitive and caring guy in the world. I was obsessed with getting on some stupid TV program but didn't and tried to get some people arrested for a theft they didn't commit. Don't you want to [[fuck]] me?''

==The Strategy==

Eggers lovingly recounts his struggle to get the attention he desperately craves armed only with a preposterously swollen ego and a substantial inheritance from his parents.  His audacity in playing out the long, painful deaths of his mother and father to gain sympathy and fool the reader into swallowing more of his self-serving [[crap]] than they otherwise would is perhaps the most staggering feature of his "memoir". 

===On-line Bullshit===

[[Image:Eggers_mcswiney.png|thumb|right|Sickening letter where Eggy tries to egger subscriptions away from lifetime subscribers to his [[stupid]] magazine]]
Despite the author's complete ignorance of things [[OTI|on-line]] in his [[shit|shitty first book]] despite the relatively recent setting, Eggers is now plural, having become several minor [[Internet]] [[meme]]s. 
Following the success of SSWHSG, Eggers became a fixture on the American literary scene; predictably, many excruciatingly one-eyed on-line fora are filled with [[moron|morons]] dedicated to discussing ''The Imitation of Eggers''.  Said fora and [[IRL]] appearances also attract large contingents of [[whores|groupies]] taken in by his depiction of himself. 

===Beth Eggers Scandal===
The control freak seriously offended his sister Beth, who [http://beebo.org/smackerels/et-tu-beth.html wrote a letter to one of his many [[fan]] [[blog]]s], telling how she had a much bigger role in the things Eggy Boy depicts as proving how he's a great "dude" in his "memoir" than he'd ever be willing to let on. It was also [http://harpers.org/subjects/BethEggers republished in Harper's] but forget that link. They stole the content from the Internet, but [[you]] have to subscribe before they'll show you more than the thumbnail.

After Beth ritually apologized on the god-author's McSwiney's site, the ''New York Post'' [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.gossip.celebrities/msg/61a5b938bd889a27 published this vague article] claiming she had [[self-pwn|committed suicide]] four months earlier.

[http://www.metafilter.com/15198/ Nobody seems certain whether she is dead or the claim was a hoax in the poorest taste.] There was no obituary and no published evidence that it really happened. The California Bar Association (she is or was a lawyer) just changed her listing to say "Elizabeth A. Eggers is NOT ENTITLED to practice law in California".

A year after the article in the ''NY Post'' (and almost 18 months after the alleged suicide), ''The American Prospect'' of Feb. 1 2003 claimed that "Beth took a fatal overdose of an antidepressant combined with an over-the-counter pain reliever, acetaminophen". 

The convenient thing for Eggy is that [[nobody]] [[George Bush doesn't care about black people|care]]s whether he killed his sister as well as his parents. The fans are all still too busy thinking they want to be him or at least have his babies.

===Amazon Scandal and Internets Disease===
Eggers and some friends were also caught giving each others' works [http://donswaim.com/nytimes.amazon.html positive reviews] in the customer comments section at Amazon.com. He also seems to employ [[bot]] armies and the above [[morons]] as [[slaves]] to influence his page hits. Even worse, as an acute sufferer of [[internet disease|Internet disease]], Eggy Boy actually seems to bribe people to reverse even the most slightly negative opinions. 

There are also [[blogs]] and semi-online publications like his supremely [[unfunny]] and unreadable magazine cum Web site, McSwiney's. All of them are centred on himself and strongly supported by the same [[moron|morons]]. 

===Ultimate Eggering===
Eggy tries to egger his lifetime subscribers out of their $100 subscriptions:

==A Rumor==
Tape recordings of Eggers and Douglas Coupland having phone sex are believed to exist; here an exasperated Eggers, eager to get off the phone, finally hisses "Jesus, dude, just, like, close your eyes, dude, and think of Kurt Cobain already dude, will you dude?"
