Bobba Bar
[[File:BobbaBar.png|right|thumb|Fags, 'nuff said]]
Bobba Bar is an [[iPod]] app made by the same faggots responsible for [[Habbo Hotel]]. It was released sometime during November of 2009 and continues to attract more and more faggotory everyday. It can be downloaded from [[iTunes]] for free.

== What the Bobba is all This Bobba About Anyway? ==
For those not familiar with Habbo, it is a <b>TOTALLY COOL PLACE FOR TEENS TO HANGOUT! YEAH BRO!</b>

In reality, it is a breeding ground for [[13 year old boys]] and [[4chan|pedophiles]]. They enjoy [[Pool's Closed|swimming in the AIDS infected pool]], getting their hands on some sweet pixelated tail, and living in their mom's basement. In the summer of '06, 4chan began raiding Habbo. The /b/rothers disrupted the game by forming /b/lockades and spamming the chat. This led to mod raep, which led to <i>moar</i> raids. Eventually, the raiders developed new tactics, such as forming swastikas and using bots to form larger /b/lockades.


== How to Troll Bobba Bar ==
There are several methods of [[griefing]] in Bobba Bar. These include:

=== /b/lockade ===

Simply standing in front of something to prevent others from accessing it has been known to cause butthurt in Habbo. aThis can also be accomplished in Bobba Bar. There are many locations that can be /b/locked by one [[nigra]] alone. However, if said nigra brings /b/lackup, other lulzier places can be blocked.

=== Trolling Individuals ===
The main point of the game is to meet [[retarded|interesting]] people and develop [[O RLY?|online-relationships]] with them. This being said, they are all very easy to troll. Simply accusing them of being a pedophile (there's a good chance they actually are) will cause drama. Encouraging them to [[an hero]], or telling them why nobody likes them are other good ways to achieve lulz. <b>GET CREATIVE</b>
