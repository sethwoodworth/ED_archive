The Bahamas
[[Image:You Money in The Bahamas.jpg|thumb|This is where all that money you lost on that [[oxymoron|"get rich quick"]] scheme went.]]

[[The Bahamas]] is a tropical paradise located near [[Florida]]. It is known as a the holiday resort of the [[rich and beautiful]] where [[whore]]s such as [[Anna Nicole Smith]] and her son Daniel go to hide from the press and later to become [[an hero]] with [[drug]]s. For some [[retard]]ed reason it is also a popular place for zillionaires to hide their massive fortunes to evade paying taxes or going to jail for massive [[scam]]s. This is probably why [[Bill Gates]] officially lives there, and why the Bahamas attracts money like [[Goatse]] attracts [[fag]]s. A large number of [[negro]] celebrity residents such as [[Oprah]] also live there, but this is probably due to [[America]] locking up [[black people]] for any minute reason rather than the tax benefits. Moving to the Bahamas is the only way for a black person to keep his or her money from the [[government]].

Chances are that if you've lost money through an elaborate [[email]] scam or through being retarded enough to believe some random guy wants to make you a millionaire, your money is now in the Bahamas. You really have [[noone]] to blame but [[retard|yourself]] if you die of starvation, it's called [[evolution]].
