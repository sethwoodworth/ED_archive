Four Loko
[[image:Dance_monkey_loko.gif|right|200px]]
'''4 Loko''' is the offspring of a nigger's love for [[ghetto|malt liquor]] and [[opioids|purple drank]] with a [[bro|bro's]] love for [[energy drinks]] and [[cocaine]].  The drink has gained popularity amongst [[blacks|minorities]] and [[party| party bros and bitches]] alike due to its ability to make you blackout and mutate your liver for under 3 dollars.  The drink also comes in a variety of nauseating flavors, most of which resemble [[jenkem]] and are even more potent.  This attraction to a drink that both tastes like shit, and makes you feel like shit, attracted a lot of attention when townies began finding [[party hard|shit covered college students on their sofas, or passed out in the street]].

| <font style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: Courier New; color: #FFE303;">'''Lemonade:'''</font><font style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: arial; color: #FFE303;">For the bitches in the house, 4 Loko has made a flavor more acidic than vinegar, and more chemical ridden than Russia!  Just like a Chernobyl lemonade stand! </font>

Probably hydrochloric acid, but you'd be too fucked up to know anyway.</font>

Now, 4 Loko has invented a drank like no other, imagine 20,000 grape jolly ranchers packed into a can of malt liquor.  O lawd.  Someone get the rope!</font>

==Jonestown v2.0 and the BanHammer.==
[[image:4lokotown.jpg|thumb|right|200px|SICK PARTY BRAH.]]
[[image:Fourloko_banhammer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[mods|Real Life mods]] about to deliver the [[banhammer]].]]
In October, 2010, after some [[party_hard| seriously wicked 4 Loko partying]] that caused [[bro| 20 some college bros]] to [[awesome|black the fuck out]], [[snob| east coast schools]] delivered a [[banhammer]] to the drink on campus.  Shortly after many other schools hopped on the banwaggon, and began lecturing their students about malt-liquor [[energy drinks]] such as 4 Loko.  {{quote|4 Loko forced me to strip off all my clothes and go on a [[lolwut|naked rampage with blood, glass and feces.]] | 4 Loko Fan boy.}}
Later that November the [[shit no one cares about|FDA and other old farts threatened to ban 4 Loko on the basis that it was unsafe]].  That same day [[alcoholics]] all over the world ran out and began to stock up as if it were prohibition all over again, sales were reported to be up by [[over 9000]] percent.  To most 4 Loko drinkers [[dumbass|the FDA warning only made the drink seem even more badass]] and encouraged them to drink. 4 Loko was banned in [http://www.good.is/post/where-is-four-loko-banned/ Washington] and [http://www.healthrelatedinfos.com/four-loko-banned-in-ohio-2177/ Ohio] after 18th Nov. 2010; banned in [http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2010/11/four_loko_banne.php New York] after 10th December 2010, [http://www.good.is/post/where-is-four-loko-banned/ Oklahoma] after 3rd December 2010. [http://www.good.is/post/where-is-four-loko-banned/ Michigan] after 4th December, 2010, and Utah [[srs bsns|PERIOD]].
