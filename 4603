What is '''''Kingory''''' you ask? Is it [[King]]? Is it [[guro|gory]]? If you clicked the link, you would be very disappointed indeed. Unfortunately, the dictionary contains no definition of what a ''Kingory'' is, and much like the rest of the website, you will be left wondering why Chinese people are allowed to make software.<br><br>
From the makers of ''[[Evony]]'' comes:

{{squote|the international version the Flash-based strategic MMO game RXSG (热血三国) which is not only the best web game but the most-played: 40 million players has registered and 600 servers are active (as of June 2009). It consists of 5 resources, 10 armaments, 5 city defenses, and 30 stratagems and combat systems.|[ http://www.kingory.eu]|}}

I'm excited already; I mean, I've played games with ''maybe'' 10 stratagems, but 30 FUCKING STRATAGEMS! But wait, there's more! If you play on a Windows system, the fine people at JoyPort UUYX will throw in malware which adds your PC to an international botnet. And it's got a People's Republic of China Internet Culture Business License, so you know they're good for it. Act now!

==''[[Evony]]'' Ripoff==
Some people have suggested this is nothing more than a blatant ripoff of the most popular internet game which promises [[Cunt|cake]] but does not deliver. To those with a keen eye, or even those with half a brain, you will realise this uses the same platform as ''Evony''. TEN POINTS TO GRYFFINDOR! Replace the market of medieval cosplayers with [[Weaboo|losers who like yellow people]] and this is what you get. Another cookie-cutter rip-off of Civilization IV.

Just like ''Evony'', the cake so promised by JoyPort UUYX is never delivered. Instead of getting to [[rape|play]] a hot stock photo, you are delivered a game full of bugs, constant requests to buy their jew gold, and shocking English.

{{squote|914 high heroes and infinite number of random heroes with different traits and properties are at your disposal. Revolutionary mix of real-time stratgy (RTS) and turn-based strategy (TBS), PvP system, and PvE & PvP system are available for the first time on your browser with a super-light ~2 MB footprint!|Well you've got me sold!|}}

Furthermore, like ''Evony'', '''Kingory''' sells itself to customers by conveniently popping up over your browser window, or by spamming imageboard and forums. But then again, it has jewels and diamonds and shit. That's cool and in with the young crowd right?<br><br>

But do you know what else is in with us kids these days? Pandas. And Kung-fu. Somebody do this!

==Plot==
{{squote|King died. Unworldly young prince succeed the throne. Dysfunctional royal court feeds the power hunger of the local military forces: Tsao Tsao, Ywan Shao and Yellow Turbans all claimed sole allegiance while waging wars against one another in the name of ridding the rebels. The darkest days of the period gave birth to spirited young lords who united the peasants to defend and fight for true peace instead of false justice.|(''Kingory'' players, you're one of them!)|}}

I like the sound of routine quests, as well as roleplaying a hero who takes care of politics and production. Oh, did we mention you have to Jew? Woops.
