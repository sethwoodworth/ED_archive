'''Johnny the Vandal''' (or '''JtV''') is an [[bored]] [[Mexico|Spic]]-Armenian [[immigrant]] living in [[Shit|Bologna]], [[Italy]], who has been trolling [[Wikipedia]] (and [[Wikia]]) from his [[Basement-dweller |basement]] since January 2003.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Michael ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Weezer/NOFX ] His main account, [[Wikipedia:Special:Contributions/Mike Garcia|Mike Garcia]], was somewhat of a [[lolcow]] that [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User%3AMike_Garcia got blocked] [[Over 9000|over 9,000]] times, including once for a [[Serious business|death threat]]. Though not the original [[wikipedia:User:Alex 101|Johnny the Vandal]] on [[TOW]], he usurped that identity, too, and became more [[Celebrity|famous]] than the original vandal. He also spent two years impersonating the one-time vandal, black person, to fuck around with the checkusers who wasted time tagging hundreds of accounts and to harass some female editors for the [[lulz]]. He did lots of [[Willy on Wheels|page move vandalism]] as well on many wikis.

Johnny spent about [[Lolwut|four years harassing some random Wikipedo]] named [[Wikipedia:User:Hephaestos|Hephaestos]],[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hephaestos&offset=20070311114617&limit=1520&action=history ] finally managing to drive him away from the wiki.

Now that Hephaestos is gone, Johnny has taken to trolling Wikipedia by impersonating former Wikipedians, usually banned users. Although they are always obvious impersonations, it always manages to fool the [[idiot|brain dead]] Wikipedos.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mister_Aardvark ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:HazelAardvark ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Eleanor_J._Cramphorn ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Free_Jarlaxle ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mister_Jarlaxle ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nobelja ] He also used to e-mail [[at least 100|hundreds]] of Wikipedia accounts to [[Grawp]] because he was too stupid to do Grawp vandalism himself, in an attempt to [[Forced Meme|force a meme]].

Johnny is like a real-life Internet incarnation of "Pistachio Disguisey," the Italian faggot who was the main character of ''[[Wikipedia:The Master of Disguise|The Master of Disguise]]'' movie. All his disguises are extremely obvious to the audience, but the movie characters (in this case, the Wikipedos) cannot recognize him.

After the implementation of the [[abuse filter]], and the subsequent e-murder of [[Grawp]], [[ByAppointmentTo]] and [[Hagger]], he [[dying alone|disappeared]] and went back to [[lurker|lurking]] from afar.
