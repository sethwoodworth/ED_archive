<font color=orange>Pyynö <nowiki>[</nowiki>''pu:n&oslash;''<nowiki>]</nowiki> the Rabbit is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[gay|webcomic]] from a time when [[gay|webcomics]] were not yet called [[gay|webcomics]]. That's why most of the links are invalid, and the guestbook remains eternally defunct.

It's a very [[gay|nice]] webcomic with [[webcomic|gay]] colours and a damning lack of originality .

50% of it is crafted with [[MS Paint|Micro$oft Paintbrush (tm)]], and 60% with the aid of [[booze]]. Pyynö him/itself drinks Porkkana instead of liquor.

The comic does, however, have an episode pertaining to America, here, s'il vous plaît: [http://pyyno.temppeli.org/amerik/index.html zomg_LINK_oneoneone] <small> (just a note: the comic is not "ironic" or "sarcastic" or anything "gay" like that, but simply boozy) </small>
