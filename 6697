Purple PJs
[[Image:Pjlog.GIF|frame|right|witty caption]][http://www.purplepjs.com Purple PJs] is a website created by a [[pedophile]] for [[16_year_old_girl|teenage girls]].  Originally Cybergrrlz, it was forced to change its name due to an [[internet lawsuit]] when a [[porn]] website threatened to sue the editor (whose daddy is a lawyer) unless she changed the name to something even [[ghey]]er than "Cybergrrlz."  The Purple PJs main page is not read by anyone, even the editorial staff, but it used to have a [[message board|forum]] that is frequented by [[16_year_old_girl|sixteen-year-old girls]], [[13_year_old_boy|thirteen-year-old boys]], and internet [[pedophile]]s, before Martine got [[butthurt]] and baleeted it.
:''Note: nothing under the "fun" section is really fun.

Purple PJs, being essentially a bureaucracy, has a distinct hierarchy, explained briefly in its [http://www.purplepjs.com/_AboutUs/ About Us] page.  At the top is [http://meetme.hotornot.com/r/?emid=NLSUH Martine], a.k.a. God.  Next are the Assistant Editors, also known as AEs (which also stands for "ass eaters"), which are not to be confused with [[Ã†]].  Next come the PEs (page editors/PEons) of popular pages, then the PEs of unpopular pages, and the [[n00b]]s who actually read this [[crap]].  Being essentially a bureaucracy, PJs also has a metric assload of pages, providing girls with opportunities to get advice on both sex AND boys, submit both stories AND poems, and share their opinions about hair products, just like in a REAL magazine.

== History ==
[[Image:Onmyface.JPG|right|thumb|Typical forumgoer]]
In 1997, Victor_M (also known as Victor_Mmmm, and sometimes as ARG, or [[A_Real_Guy]]), trolling a chat room for teenage [[lesbian]]s under the alias Heidi82, decided to create a very badly designed website to attract teenage girls and get them to share stories about their first periods and naughty things they did with their [[boyfriend]]s.  The website became fairly popular and due to much pressure for Heidi82 to produce pictures and make public appearances, she was "grounded" and control of the site was handed over to Victor_M's daughter Jennifer_M, who some, despite having photographic evidence of her existence, claim was another of Victor's aliases, or possibly a [[girlfriend|fuckbuddy]] he paid to pretend to be his daughter.

Jennifer_M lost interest sometime around 1999, and Martine, a [[16-year-old girl]] (literally) with a [[centipede filled vagina]] and a lawyer daddy became editor and dictator of Cybergrrlz.com and has remained its Dear Leader ever since.  It has been speculated that Martine enjoys the line on her resume much more than she enjoys actually contributing to the website.  The Martine era has involved copious amounts of both [[drama]] and downtime, as well as the frequent [[h4X0r]]ing of the forum by [[nerd]]s and [[Dutch]]men.

At the end of June 2006, the Martine era appeared to come to an end.  After completely fucking up the site, making it look like ass, [[baleet]]ing the forum, pissing off all the regulars, and seeing over 60% of the staff walk out, Martine [[quitting IRC forever|resigned]] from the position of Editor in Chief, then seemingly disappeared from the [[internets]]. Christie, a long-time PJ user, ass eater, and bogan, was named as her [[sockpuppet|replacement]].  It is rumored that Martine is still playing dictator from behind the scenes, but Christie is to take the blame when the site ultimately fails, which will probably happen next week.  Another rumor was that Martine had [[death|quit IRL forever]], but sadly, this was not true.

[[Last Thursday]], Martine returned from marrying Daniel, a noted [[fucktard]] and cuntpuppet, and revamped the site design again, making it even uglier, and adding [[copyright infringement|stolen images]].  This appeared to be an attempt to prove that the 5-month-old "under construction" message had not been left up out of sheer laziness.  Nobody really knows what Martine did in the months she was absent, since everyone knows that [[Catholic]]s don't actually have [[sex]] because it gives them the [[AIDS]].  It is assumed that she briefly ran away to [[Mexico]] where she snorted [[drug|coke]] out of the buttcrack of a [[midget]] [[crackwhore]] with one eye, and was briefly sold into [[prostitute|female slavery]].  At any rate, she is back now and fucking up the website [[to the max]].  For more information, see the [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Purple_PJs#Above_the_Law "Above the Law"] section below.

== TEH DRAMAZ ==

[[Image:nekkid.gif|frame|right|you'll be arrested for seeing this]]Purple PJs has had its share of [[drama]], from bannings and unbannings, to the reign of terror by a "[[pedophile]]" known as Gab, to board deletions and mass overthrow of admins, to ridiculous grudges based on imaginary rivalries that have no bearing on real life.  Numerous "rebel boards" have also been created to protest Martine's inability to run a site.  The average lifespan of a rebel board is approximately one week.

Martine is very [[anal]] about copyrights. The page is plastered with [[copyright]] Martine notices. This has led to the threat of at least one [[internet lawsuit]] by Martine's daddy against [[Emilyjo]], a college student also known to have a [[centipede filled vagina]] and to be a chickenshit pussy who bends to the slightest pressure, who made a parody logo for her rebel board The Farce.  As a result, other parody logos were made, the best of which being The Tentacle, a homage to [[hentai]] and [[Cthulhu]].

Martine also worries incessantly about the threat of [[pedophiles]] being attracted to her website filled with young, nubile, juicy, sexy, [[Fucktard|dumb-as-fuck]] teenage girls.  As a result, she ignored Victor_Mmm for years, focusing her crusade instead on Gab, a.k.a. Bart the Trucker.  PJs admins blame most trouble that arises on Gab returning, due to his neverending quest for PJer pussy.  Despite this, Gab has made no attempt to contact any board members or even initiated severely dirty chats, and has merely been an annoyance.  It's now a common occurrence for forum regulars to call each other truckers and claim to be part of a [[rape]] convoy with Bart.  If a person causing trouble is not Bart, he is [[SteveUberAlles|Steve]], an obnoxious [[libertarian]] who loves Devo, [[TL;DR]], and [[buttsecks]].

At the end of 2004, PJs experienced a pedophilia scandal that didn't exist solely in Martine's head.  Victor_Mmm cybered with a 13-year-old girl in the PJ chat room, "a safe place for girls," then sent the log to a PJer to prove the stupidity of teenage girls.  Having suspected him of being a [[sick fuck]] for years, forum regulars jumped all over this and [[A_Real_Guy|Victor_Mmm]] was [[banned]] soon after.  In response, [[A_Real_Guy|Victor_Mmm]] created his [http://www.argville.com own site] for teenage girls.  So far, it has been more successful than any other site created by pissed off ex-PJers.  We suspect this is due to Victor's charisma, marketing skills, and ability to summon legions of [[sockpuppet]]s to his command.

While Martine usually throws a shit fit if anyone either does something remotely "threatening" to the "emotional wellbeing" of [[16-year-old girl|PJers]] or if anyone even thinks of creating a website remotely similar in content to PJs (thus "stealing" her "copyrighted material"), she did not in this case.  In fact, she listed PJers' cruel mistreatment of Victor as one of her reasons when she [[baleet]]ed the forum.  It is speculated that she just loves teh aged [[cock|cawk]].

:''Important legal disclaimer:  We don't have real evidence that Victor_Mmm actually enjoys the company and cybersex of teenage girls in a non-platonic way.  Maybe 53-year-olds and 13-year-olds can be just friends.

[[Image:Ketchup.JPG|right|thumb|dramatization]]Back in the days of CoolBoard and EZboard, PJs was subject to board wars, especially with 3DMM and Khakhain.  These fights went on forever until an admin or moderator locked the threads, spawning a "why was my thread locked" thread and even more drama, until most of the participants were [[banned]].  Internal fights, such as the great Portrayed's birthday debacle in which [[porn]] was posted (OMG, you could see [[balls]]!), also produced the same result.

Being home to so many 16-year-old girls, PJs has had its fair share of typical teen girl [[drama]], including the obligatory [[suicide]].  Arizonagurl, a girl who posted on the PJ forum semi-regularly, committed suicide, or so her "friend" informed the board.  Moderators quickly noticed that Arizonagurl's friend had the same IP address, and once she admitted her [[suicide]] was fake, Arizonagurl was [[banned]] like Gab.

Several PJers have also posted [[cutting]] pics, which prompted [[Emilyjo]], Alex, [[User:Fratgirl|Raspy]], Julie, and other members of a curious cadre of [[troll]] regulars to create a thread of their own "cutting pics," featuring such items as ketchup and barbecue sauce.  16-year-old girls cried and cut more and the thread was locked.

== Martine's Meltdown ==

[[Image:PPJ1.jpg|frame|right|AE Attacks!!]]In late June 2006, Martine created a thread entitled "Dirty Laundry," in which she "apologized" (blamed [[abstruse]] and karin) for being a giant [[cunt]] [[whore]] ever since she began her Nazi reign/began having "trust issues". Not surprisingly the thread was quickly reduced into batshit craziness, mostly spewing from Martine's centipede-filled vagina.

While Martine was foaming at the mouth, she also revealed that she had been reading other users' private messages for some time, making sure that no evil plots could be hatched to overthrow her glorious reign.

The thread quickly vanished, and shortly after, the forum "mysteriously" "disappeared" as well. While one theory blames [[hacker|hax0rz]], the more popular theory is Martine [[baleet]]ed the forum because she is a [[whore]]bag and cannot deal with the idea that someone somewhere might be mocking her.

[[Image: Byebyeforum.PNG|frame|left|The "official" story]]The following day, it was revealed on the super-secret staff forum that the forum was gone forever, and there were no plans to actually post this on the website, perhaps because Martine realizes that no one actually reads the website.

In drama-filled revenge, an AE edited the main website so that it attacked Martine. [[LOLZ]] ensued and Martine threatened to [[baleet]] the whole website and fire the AEs.  These plans quickly changed as Martine realized that without the site, she would have nothing to be a [[crazy]] [[fascist]] about, and without staff, she might actually have to do some work on the website.

Beware the Martine. She is a jealous cunt and will probably hate you forever because you saw this - and punishment might include not being allowed to be a forum moderator!  (Oh fuckshit!  There is no more forum!  Now what will we be [[ban]]ned from [[mod]]erating?!) OH NOEZ.

== Above the Law ==
[[Image:Creativitygirl.jpg|frame|right|"Creativitygirl.jpg"]]
After launching the godawful site design of shit in July 2006, Martine disappeared from PJs to get [[married]] to someone just as [[anal]] and [[fucktard]]ed as she is.  Truly a match made in [[heaven]].  Returning after her brief, disappointing, and surely premature ejaculation-filled honeymoon, Martine revamped the site design again, making it [[retarded|ugly in a different way]].

Apparently, all the [[pity sex|hot Catholic sex]] went to Martine's head, as the new site design featured several (ass-ugly) photos stolen from [http://www.istockphoto.com istockphoto.com], saving Martine a grand total of $10 off the cost of running the site, and proving that copyright law only applied to her intellectual property.  The [[e-lawyers]] were called and istockphoto.com was contacted.  We await the unfolding of any subsequent drama.

Compare the photo on the right to this: [http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/people_specific_attributes/age/adults/2255072_busy_relax.php?id=2255072 Exhibit A].

*Will Martine learn that it's not fair to try to [[internet lawsuit|sue]] people for stealing your ideas (such as editing the clothes off your drawings or launching a website called "Ask A Bitch"), then turn around and steal other people's stuff?

*Will istockphoto make Martine [[pwned|take the pictures down]]?

*Will Martine's Lawyer Daddy save the day?

*Will Martine countersue, claiming that all images of girls using laptops have been copyrighted by her since [[at least 100 years ago]]?

''Stay tuned for the exciting conclusion!''

'''Update''':  Martine has removed the stolen images, like the pussy she is.  We eagerly await an angst-ridden post in the staff forum.  [[LOL]] [[PWNED]]!
