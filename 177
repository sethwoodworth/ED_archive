A Storehouse of Knowledge

[[File:ASK Logo.JPG|thumb|right|Logo]]
'''A Storehouse of Knowledge''' ('''[[Asking for it|aSK]]''') is [[wiki]] written in a [[Creationism|Biblical viewpoint]]. Being a mouthful to say and a handful to type, this site is far from the first search result when [[googling]] "bible wiki". Contrary to popular belief, A Storehouse of Knowledge isn't a [[Conservapedia]] spin-off. Instead, A Storehouse of Knowledge is a splinter wiki created by Conservapedia deviant and outcast '''Philip J. Rayment'''. As with [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], aSK loves the [[Ã¦]].

*Anything other than ''Young Earth Creationism'' is wrong.

==Talk pages==
Most of the activity on aSK is generally found on the talk pages. Unlike Conservapedia, aSK allows lengthy debates with the opposition, because its founder is obviously smarter than all conservapedians put together. The opposition is mostly made up of [[atheists]] and [[evolutionists]]. These lifeless users would waste time trying to prove why the aSK users are wrong, despite the fact that wiki is clearly meant to be a pro-Bible wiki instead of a neutral one. On the bright side, these debates are of a scientific nature rather than the political agreements you see on Conservapedia, which means actually thought goes into the comments. Despite the existence of pro-evolution wikis that the opposition could hang out at, the opposition appears to be [[offended]] by the fact that Bible-centric wikis exist, so they continue their pointless offensive into unknown Creationist territory. Why people who would never listen to or understand each other continue to debate is a beyond the comprehension of rational people.

===Philip J. Rayment===
'''Philip J. Rayment''' is aSK's founder and owner. He isn't shy about sharing your life story with us, as seen [[wikipedia:User:Philip J. Rayment|on Wikipedia]], on [http://www.astorehouseofknowledge.info/User:Philip_J._Rayment A Shorehouse of Knowledge], and [http://web.aanet.com.au/P_Rayment/Conservapedia/Index.htm in an essay he wrote]. Philip is a [[Australian]] [[Protestant]], so his [[conservative]] views isn't something out of the ordinary. The [[Bible]] and his deeply religious parents taught him everything he knows. Judging from his autobiography, the Bible makes up 90% of Philip's life and career. Philip derives most of his supporting evidence for his views from [[wikipedia:Creation Ministries International|Creation Ministries International]].

Philip started revising [[Wikipedia]] on July 8, 2004. He later discovered that [[Truth|Wikipedia was filled with bias]], especially against [[Creationism]]. He later joined the CreationWiki in October 2004. Philip wouldn't join Conservapedia until March 17, 2007. [http://www.conservapedia.com/User:Conservative Conservative] (so much for Conservapedia's "first name and last intial" policy) was the first person to notice Philip. As expected, [http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=User_talk%3APhilip_J._Rayment&diff=59434&oldid=58845 their first conversation] was about how biased Wikipedia is.

On [[April Fools|April 1, 2007]], Conservative [http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=User_talk:Philip_J._Rayment&diff=80182&oldid=64566 encouraged Philip to request sysop rights] from [[Aschlafly]]. On April 2, 2007, Aschlafly [http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&page=User%3APhilip+J.+Rayment makes Philip a sysop]. Aschlafly basically [http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=User_talk:Philip_J._Rayment&diff=82349&oldid=81749 tells Philip] that he sysop'd him in order to market Conservapedia to Australians and that Philip should mercilessly permaban vandals. In crowning moment of [[awesome]], Philip thanks Aschlafly by [http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=User_talk:Philip_J._Rayment&diff=82826&oldid=82349 telling him that Aschlafly doesn't know a single thing about Australia].

Eventually, Philip learned, as many others have learned, that Conservapedia wasn't a good community to be a part of. Conservapedia was transforming into an attack site. Conservapedia was becoming a host for arguments and disputes. Instead of defending conservative views and rebutting liberal views, Conservapedia became more about showing how [[liberals]] and [[evolutionist]] are pure evil and how [[Obama]] was an evil [[Muslim]] infiltrator secretly plotting to bring down the US. As a result, Philip left Conservapedia in order to build a better wiki.

===Other sysops===
*[http://www.astorehouseofknowledge.info/User:LowKey LowKey] (Bradley Fleming) &ndash; [http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User%3ALowKey Repeatedly blocked and unblocked from Conservapedia] but eventually found sanctuary in aSK. This [[Australian]] doesn't have any problems sharing his [[dox]] and has even created [http://www.astorehouseofknowledge.info/Ipswich_%28Australia%29 an article on his hometown].
*[http://www.astorehouseofknowledge.info/User:TimS TimS] &ndash; As with Philip, TimS [http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&page=User%3ATimS is a former Conservapedia sysop]. TimS was [http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&page=User%3ATimS banned from Conservapedia] by TK for [[Wut?|for being a liberal spy]]. Unlike the other sysops, TimS is from [[New Jersey]] rather than Australia. [http://www.astorehouseofknowledge.info/User:TimS/CP_resignation His CP resignation page] gives valuable insight on his relationship with Conservapedia.
