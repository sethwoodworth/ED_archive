<!-- The above picture does not need a better caption.-->

'''God''' (also known as [[Allah]], [[Cthulhu]], [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]], [[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya|Haruhi Suzumiya]], [[House]], [[Josef Fritzl]], [[Black Jesus]], [[GodJesus]], [[Xenu]], [[Ted Jesus Christ GOD!]], [[Moot]], [[Yahweh]], Odin, Verus, [[Wise Beard Man|Zeus]], and Morgan Freeman) is the incredibly cruel, psychopathic, homicidal, Sociopathic and illogical to the point of madness [[Santa Claus]] for adults. It is claimed that he/she is also a [[lie]] or a scam set up by the [[Jews]] for the [[lulz]].

He is simultaneously the [[Hero|protagonist]] and [[Evil|antagonist]] of the [[Bible]], a book which has somehow sold more copies than ''[[Harry Potter]] (but still not as much as [[Lord of the Rings]])'', making it the most successful work of [[fiction]] evar. The Bible, the chronology of God's Adventures, is a volume of [[trolling]], [[extreme]] [[violence]], [[incest]], [[plague]]s, [[rape]]  and other sorts of [[epic win]]. [[Some argue|It is believed]] that God created the universe for no other reason than to play a [[game]] of [[The Sims]] against [[Satan]]. He tends to be a major [[douche]]. He also appears to have taken some kind of anger management class in between the Old and New Testaments. [[Catholic]]s say that happened because [[Jews]] don't know what they're talking about. Jews just don't care.  God also appears in other works such as the [[Koran]] and [[Mormon|The Book of Mormon]], prompting disagreements among God [[fan]]s as to what is truly [[canon]]. God will never answer prayers because He is too busy for [[you]], because He spends all of that time in space not existing. 

{{quote|Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?  Then he is not omnipotent.

Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?|[[Trolls]], on God.}}

==The Attributes of God==
[[File:Cleverbot God.PNG|thumb|300px|God loves us all. But not [[you]].]]

[[christfag|Theists]] will tell you that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent.  

{{quote|Can God make a stone He cannot lift?|Trolls}}

This famous paradox is in fact a [[crap|meaningless tautology]], the equivalent of saying: "Can God do something He cannot do?" but it is very likely to cause [[RAGE]] and will potentially result in [[lulz]].  A much more [[cool story bro|meaningful and interesting]] paradox is this:

{{quote|How does God know He is omniscient?}}

The most notorious [[NO U|rebuttal]] to this question is "*pause*...err...because he's omniscient?".  Citing God's omniscience as evidence for his omniscience is [[you|highly inadequate]] because even I could do that.  The only true answer is this: it does not make logical sense for any being to be able to know that any other being including themselves knows everything.  From this we can conclude that even if God is omniscient, He does not know that He is, and has no grounds for telling us that He is.  The [[obvious]] questions follow, "How does He know He is omnipotent or omnipresent then?"  Again, the answer is that He does not. This is of course /b/ logic as it makes no sense, such as achieving a power level of [[over 9000]].

Another [[no one cares|notorious dilemma]] is the problem of omniscience and foreknowledge.  If God knows what we are going to do, then in what sense are we free?  The answer: not in any sense.  This is [[serious fucking business]] for theists.  If we are not free then God has no grounds for [[life|making us suffer]] (see problem of evil above).  So, if benevolence is the most crucial part of God's nature (which it is as far as 99% of Christians are concerned) then we must assume that God does not have foreknowledge of human actions.  

{{quote|Does God know what He is about to think next?}}
God is fundamentally [[anthro]]pomorphic. In the Christian Bible and elsewhere He is simply an Ã¼ber-human: [[lies|he considers things,]] [[Truth|He wants things]], He communicates, [[lies|He expresses emotions and feelings like compassion]], [[Truth|jealousy, hate, pity]], [[false|regret]], [[You Mad|anger]], [[fury]], ire, wrath and [[RAGE]]. Philosophical contradictions-in-terms like "omniscience" [[fail]] the moment you seriously think about what it means to really know everything. An omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent being must be immutable. Life is change: to be immutable is to be dead.

The result is a God that is a) as far as anyone knows, not omnipotent, omniscient, or omnipresent, and b) does not have [[Psychic|knowledge of future human actions]].  On these grounds it is perfectly reasonable to take the side of [[Satan]] in the war between good and evil because one should stand a chance of [[You win the prize|winning]].

[[Oxymoron|Clever Christians]] will insist that God transcends [[logic]], and as such the above arguments do not apply.  The appropriate reply is this: If God transcends logic then He is perfectly capable of bringing about two contradictory scenarios simultaneously.  He could create a world in which human beings are completely free to act as they will, and at the same time completely controlled to do the good.  However, God has not brought about any such scenario.  The only conclusion is that He is either [[b/|fundamentally evil]], or does not [[b/|transcend logic]].

Clever Christians might also tell you that God transcends space and time.  If they say this you need only ask one simple question: "What do you mean?".  This is 100% guaranteed to make them [[STFU|shut the fuck up]].

===Why You Need God===
These days, God is very popular, and if you want to be cool, you must believe in Him. He is very respected in our society (see [[dumbass]]) and many people would do anytHing for Him (see Heaven's Gate). It's very obvious wHy He is so revered. To date, He is tHe only figure to ever maintain a state of nonexistence wHile convincing more tHan 70% of tHe world otHerwise. God Has also acHieved tHe Honor of getting tHe letter H capitalized wHen He is referred to as "He" or "Him." Clearly, belief in God is essential to Happiness.

===The Name of God===
In the Bible, God is referred to by many names. The first name used in the book of Genesis is "[http://biblos.com/genesis/1-1.htm Elohim]" (which is a plural word), translated in [[English]] simply as "God". In Chapter [[2]], He is called "YHVH Elohim", read as "Adonai Elohim" and often translated in English as "LORD God". He is also referred to as "[http://biblos.com/genesis/14-18.htm El Elyon]" (Most [[High]] God) and "[http://biblos.com/genesis/17-1.htm El Shaddai]" ([[Almighty Pillage|Almighty]] God). In Exodus, when [[Moses]] [http://bible.cc/exodus/3-13.htm asks God what name His name is], God says "[http://bible.cc/exodus/3-14.htm Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh]" (I AM THAT I AM), suggesting that He is actually Popeye. Later He tells Moses that His true name is "[http://bible.cc/exodus/6-3.htm YHVH]", sometimes rendered as "Yahweh" or "Jehovah". But later, God tells Moses that His name is "[http://bible.cc/exodus/34-14.htm Kanna]" or "[[Jealous]]". And then He talks of [http://bible.cc/exodus/34-15.htm whoring].

In the Koran, God is referred to by [[at least 100]] [http://www.ezsoftech.com/islamic/iqlas5.asp names].

==God and the Internet==
As [[encyclopedia dramatica]] always tries to be [[lie|open-minded and fair]] it would be difficult to write an article that is either 100% pro-God or 100% anti-God without having [[Christians|one]] or [[atheists|other]] group of online fucktards pissing themselves in joy. It has therefore been concluded that the debate of God's existance is best left as is it - caused major drama and [[serious business]] on the web. Though [[some argue]] if God existed the ever-expanding tumour that is the internet would not exist, if he does exist God is most likely sitting on his cloud in heaven trolling the shit out of both his followers and haters.

===The Advent of the Internets===
[[Image:Armorofgod.jpg|thumb|[[Pedophilia|Protect your kiddies.]]]]

God created the [[Internets]] in a moment of great brilliance. Here is the five-part inspiring tale:

# In the beginning, God created the [[lulz]] and the Internets. The internets were without form, and [[shit|void]], and [[Goth|darkness]] was upon the face of the [[camwhore]]: and the [[Alcohol|spirit]] of God destroyed [[Oclet]]'s liver.
# And God said: '''"LET THERE BE [[Death Note|LIGHT]]!"''' And there was [[high contrast|light]]. And God saw that the light was good, for the Light was too bright and prevented even Him from seeing the [[Fat]] of the [[Camwhore]].
# And God created a firmament in the midst of the [[internets]], to divide the [[Uncyclopedia|interbutts]] from the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|internets]]; and He called the firmament [[Usenet]].
# And God said, "Let all the [[failure]]s of the internet be gathered together into one place, and let them [[spam]] that place relentlessly." And it was so, and [[4chan]] was born.
# And God said, "Let [[forums]] multiply, and be fruitful, and fill the internets with their [[drama]]." And it was so.
# And God said, "Let all manner of [[fucktards]] [[Shit|write]] on [[LiveJournal]]; and let them [[Fuck|multiply]], and be [[pregnant|fruitful]]." And [[fucktards]] came forth in all manner of communities, and warred with each other relentlessly; and lo, some [[Teen mothers|multiplied]], and others [[childfree|didn't]], according to their kinds.
# And God saw that it was funny, and lo! He [[lol]]led.
# And God said "Let us create a [[Wiki]] on the Internet. Let it catalog [[Drama]], so that those who are not [[Mediacrat|all-knowing]] may attain [[enlightenment]]; and let them [[LOL]].
# And God created [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] for his own amusement, and created [[Dramacrats]] to maintain it; funny and [[ironic]]. He then said to the Dramacrats, "Lol! I have given you the [[internets]]; multiply with captchas, and fill the internets and catalog it, and you shall have knowledge of every [[faggot]] and every [[furry]] on the interweb for major [[lulz]].
# And God saw everything that He had made, and He laughed at [[furries]] and smote them mightily.
# And He [[Holocaust|smote]] the [[Jews]], for they [[killed]] [[Jesus|his son]].
# And with this last act, God [[Will Smith|neuralized]] the people of the internetz, giving them total [[Old|retro]][[History|grade]] amnesia. God then disappeared forever, leaving behind a mystery to be solved by all of his [[Retards|followers]].

==God's Many Forms==
According to [[Christians]], God exists in Trinity, which means that He has [[multiple personality disorder]]. His three personalities are:
* '''[[Father|The Father]]'''
: This is the coolest version of God. The Father [[rapes|smites]] people and [[pwn]]s them [[in the ass]] for pretty much anything, from [[homosexuality]] (excluding people on top according to American Dad) to black person. [[4chan|Whenever He makes a mistake]], people tend to say that it was to punish us for some [[Nothing|evil doing]]. In other words, an [[admin]]. The Father's titles also include: [[Obama|A long-legged Mac Daddy]], [[awesome|A pimp-ass motherfucker]], and [[badass|the Roman Rapist]].
* '''[[Jesus|The Son]]'''
:This version of God is a raging [[faggot]] and whiny pussy who took it up the ass from [[rubberduc]]. Notable features include his ability to turn water into [[santorum]] and his getting nailed to a cross. In other words, a [[moderator]]. 
* '''[[Ceiling Cat|The Holy Ghost]]'''
: This version of God allows God to [[sick fuck|watch everyone in the fucking world at once]] (like [[Santa]]) so it is assumed that his internet-era incarnation is [[Ceiling Cat]]. In other words, the [[internet]] itself.

== The Gender of God ==

[[Image:GodBukkake.JPG|thumb|[[Bukkake|Proof]] that God is a man.]]

God is a [[black]] male. He resembles [[Black|Morgan Freeman]]  greatly.

== His Views on Sex ==
Like everything else in the Bible the supposed Word of God contradicts itself on the issue of [[sex]].

=== Anything is Allowed ===

[[Image:God-babyfuck.JPG|thumb|God thinks baby fucking is AWW-RIGHTTT!!!]]

God is, in fact, a [[sick fuck]]. He believes that if you are married and both consent, then [[guro|pretty]] [[BDSM|much]] [[Scat|anything]] can go on between the two of you and it's [[awwright]]. Turns out He really has no problem with [[incest]] either, since Adam and Eve obviously had to have sex with their kids to populate the earth.

Even comparatively late, teh ghey was perfectly fine on a "don't ask/don't tell" basis. Sure, they say that all the homoerotic stuff between David and Jonathan isn't really homoerotic, but they are liars. It is.

[[At least 100 years ago]], in response to pressure from the [[nigras|heathens]] his [[fags|missionaries]] were trying to convert, He began to advocate other types of sexual acts like [[buttsex]] and [[bukkake]]. Although it is becoming increasingly popular as a way to maintain [[technical virginity]], many Christians still fear [[anal]] and some are quite sure God was on [[peyote]] when He invented [[pegging]]. 

However, fucking pies is still fair game. As is, apparently, [[DO NOT WANT|consensual sex in the missionary position]]:
* '''Song 2:3''': "Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. In his shade I took great delight and sat down, and his fruit was sweet to my taste."
* '''Song 4:16''': "Awake, O north wind, and come, wind of the south; make my garden breathe out fragrance. Let its spices be wafted abroad. May my beloved come into his garden and eat its choice fruits!"

Giving your woman a handjob is perfectly fine
* '''Song 2:6''': "His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me." [some great lulz to be had with that coy mistranslation]

So is performing cunnilingus ''all night long''
* '''Song 2:16-17''': "My lover is mine and I am his; he browses among the lilies until the day breaks, and the shadows flee."

DFK - no worries!
* '''Song 4:11''': "Your lips drop sweetness as the honeycomb, my bride.; milk and honey are under your tongue."

And sniffing poontang
* '''Song 4:15-16''': "[He]: You are a garden fountain, a well of flowing water ..." / [She]: "Awake north wind! Blow on my garden that its fragrance may spread abroad."

And generally getting it on
* '''Song 5:4-5''': "My lover thrust his hand through the latch-opening; my heart began to pound for him. I rose up to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, and my fingers flowing with myrrh on the handles of the bolt."

Oh yes, they explain this stuff away with lulzworthy material such as: "to find the key for unlocking the Song, interpreters have looked to prophetic, wisdom and apocalyptic passages of scripture", and: "the Song is an allegory of the relationship between God and Israel, or between Christ and The Church". Anything, it seems, other than the perfectly obvious: "The Song of Songs" in the Bible is about [[fucking]].

=== Nothing is Allowed ===
Without 2,000 years of morality ground into us, nobody would think twice about committing [[sin]]ful sexual acts such as [[incest]] and [[bestiality]]. The things you cannot have sex with include:

* [[Bestiality|Animals]]
* [[Gays]] - Even [[Traps]]
* [[Incest|Members of your own family]] - including adopted and stepfamilies
* [[Pedophile|Kiddies]]
* Anyone outside of marriage - [[Prostitutes]], "open-minded" [[friends]], thy neighbor's spouse, etc.
* [[Whore|Anyone before marriage]]
* Anyone you are married to.
* [[Gay|Members of your own gender]]
* [[Masturbation]] is a nein-nein.
* So is [[porn]].
* Even [[Mindfuck|thinking about it]] is not allowed.
* Actually, sexuality is a [[sin]] no matter what. [[Seriously]] - look up St. Augustine.
* Hell, even Asexuality is a sin!
* This proves that everyone goes to [[Hell]].
*[[You]]

== Criticism ==
[[Some argue|People believe]] that due to the fact that God is omnipotent and will never die, He [[haxorz]] [[life]]. The [[nihilist]] [[philosopher]] [[Nietzsche]] attempted to [[IRL ban]] God, proclaiming that [[Unwarranted self importance|"''God is dead.''"]]  Based on the religious demographics of the [[Middle East]] and the [[United States]], He clearly [[failed]].

God is not a [[virgin]], although the Old Testament God was. He lost His virginity while [[impregnating]] Mary with his massive God [[Rod]].

There are many different schools of God [[fanboys]], each of which is known as a [[religion]]. Religions that believe in God include [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Mormon]], and about twenty obscure ones like [[Huh|Zoroastrianism]]. Like all Fanboys they don't seem to relise that they are all wrong.

== Proof A Benevolent God Does Not Exist ==

[[Image:Goddemot.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Intelligent_Design|Proof of God's existence]].]] 

If God were to be definitively proven not to exist, it would end all arguments ever, and self-righteous [[atheists]] all over the world would simultaneously reach [[orgasm]] in their parents' basements.  Proof of a benevolent God not existing:

== God Did WTC ==

[[Image:Sphinxcoke.jpg|thumb|120px|right|The abandoned and unfinished Tower of Babel.]]

If there's anything God hates more than [[homosexuals]], it's towers.  The Tower of Babel was the Biblical version of the World Trade Center.  As is clearly described in [[Bible|reputable history books]], God didn't like this, so He created the [[French]].  Until then, the entire world spoke [[German]]; so after the French appeared, everybody was too busy [[raping]] and plundering them, and forgot about building the tower.  This was back in the days when God didn't have Muslims to do his dirty laundry, so He had to find clever and innovative ways of accomplishing His [[genocide|purposes]].

[[Image:Nyc_wtc_world_trade_center_brochure.jpg|center|frame|Mankind's brazen defiance of God [[Pun|reaches new heights]].]]

In more recent times, God saw that [[America|Man]] had built not just one, but ''two'' monuments in defiance of the Almighty. And it was not good. God, realizing his lawn was getting too long again, commanded his [[Taliban|faithful followers]] to mow it. This time, the message was much more clear: '''[[GTFO]] MY [[Heaven|HEAVEN]].'''
