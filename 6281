A Password is a magic key made of ASCII characters that opens parts of the internet. [[Sarah Palin|The uninformed]] have been lead to believe that it [[Lie|protects their personal information and identity]]. In actuality the password is the central object in the real live video game that is the [[internet]]. The object of the internet is for [[HACKERS ON STEROIDS|Players]] try to find as many [[Newbie|people's]] passwords as possible.  Finding passwords can be redeemed for [[lulz]] by [[raid|sacking web sites]], destroying [[My Space]] pages and [[lulz|ruining innocent peoples lives]]. When someone [[cuntpaste|discovers]], or [[hacker|hack]]s, another person's password it is invariably a direct path to [[lulz]] for everyone they know and a substantial amount of [[LJ Drama|other people]]. 


==Basic Information==

[[At least 100]] people have tried to stop password theft through methods such as using Md5 but this has [[fail]]ed resulting in many [[lulz]].
