[[Firedarkdragon]] is your typical deviantART [[furfag]], but with a twist. As most [[furfags]] love cutesy, fuzzy things with five penises, this one instead likes gore, violence, and blood (with, of course, five penises). Someone's [[Hugbox|mommy didn't hug them enough]], either that or daddy [[rape|raped]] someone a bit too much. A fine example of your super popular [[furfag]], the only reason they are popular is they have no life and do nothing but spam shitty art for their friends and themselves to try and make each others [[butthurt]] go away. What they do not realize is, no amount of shitty art will make things better. Not Even Doom Music.

Firefurfagon is very popular on deviantART as she caters to the demands of the site in spades: [[Angst]], [[Furries]], [[Anime]], [[Yiff]]ing, [[Emos]], [[Faggotry]], and last but certainly not least, stupidity. Her skill at trend-whoring is so epic that only a few artists can surpass her. [[Zeriara]] and [[Snapesnogger]] come to mind. God forbid she ever starts [[rape|raping]] the ''[[Lion King]]'' or ''[[Harry Potter]]'' fandoms. 

Also, she loves playing the victim: [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Internet_drama "I have no friends, I am alone, I waste all my time in a computer screen, baaaaaaaah!!!!11!!1!"]	 
	 
She is very active on dA and has many clubs which she belongs to and many friends all over the world.

== LOL RAEP DRAMAS ==	 
<s>Breaking news: [http://firedarkdragon.deviantart.com/journal/11458494/ The DA journal about it]</s> BALEETED! The screencaps below will have to do.	 
	 
Recently, furfagon has been moar and moar suicidal. At the present time, we are unsure if this is related to [[The Great Sonic-cide of 2007]] but we are keeping our ears to our intarnets. I'll let the journals tell the story.

Of course, Luz (more like Lulz, amirite?) thought the best thing to do when you get raped is log in to your DA, post a journal about it! Don't forget to answer with crying smilies without any bit of explanation to whoever comments on your journal. Outcome: Hundreds of free pageviews. And as any deviantARTlet can tell you, pageviews = liquid sex.

=== The Imaginary Rapist Dies ===	 

[[Image:Fddrapistdies.jpg|thumb|left|HOW CONVENIEEEEEEEEEEENT]]

*On Wednesday Jan 24, 2007, 9:16 AM firefagon broke the news that her favorite [[hugbox]] inducing medium had just passed away in this [http://firedarkdragon.deviantart.com/journal/11550426/ journal]. The rapist, who remains unnamed (which is surprising given firfagon's history of naming people who shouldn't be), met with vigilante justice sometime recently. This is both hilarious and sad, as we have searched as many news networks websites, and have found ZERO news on any rapists, or murdering of a rapist in the Argentine region of the world. 	 
	 
{{Quote|i was in my building`s door watching all,<br/>	 
''but i never imagined the guy was dead,<br/> 	 
''all i can guess is those ppl hitted him to death.<br/>	 
|Firedarkdragon}}	 
	 
*We have concluded that flamingdouchedrinker has made up the whole [[drama]] about being [[rape]]d just to garner attention from people. We have a picture of her, and she is no prize, other than the fact that she is apparently easy to [[rape]] repeatedly. Also, to any rapist in her area, she believes she is a dragon and the queen of [[England | hell]]; if you do manage to [[rape]] her, please take pictures and make sure they end up on the [[Fox News | major news networks.]] It sure is convenient that her would-be assailant has been slain, because now he won't have to answer for his crimes in a court of law! South America isn't known for it's legal process but it probably isn't just a bunch of guys with spears grunting at each other. Now with no rapist, how will fuckingdongdevourer create [[emo]] journals where she is the victim? We have no idea either, but we will keep you up to date on what imaginary problem strikes this [[furfag]] next.

I killed him lawls

== Reaction to ED ==	
 
[[Image:Fire sets them up the pain series.jpg|thumb|left|The original reaction to ED. Not lulzy at all. But...]]

[[Image:Fdd-condensed-journal.jpg|thumb|right|Two edits later, at least 100 of her friends are exposed to the [[Pain Series]].]]

[[Image:FirefagonfindsED.jpg|right|thumb|<s>Have we been found out?</s> No, this was just her being stupid.]]

*<b>At first firefagon was very happy about her article on ED</b>, for someone who is so constantly depressed, and being raped, it absolutely brightened her day! As that was not [[lulz|lulzy]] at all, the mastermind behind this article had to do something drastic. This editor noticed that she was linking directly to this page. A plan was sired. The editor quickly slapped the [[Pain Series]] template on the top of the page in the hopes that her fanbrats would follow the link to HORROR! And the fantards did click it, and they are now ruined for life and seek shelter in their [[hugbox|hugboxes]] from the horrors that are the intarnets.	 

*The best part was that firefagon edited this journal, not once, BUT TWICE, and DID NOT REMOVE THE LINK TO THE PAIN SERIES or even warn her moron fans until the end of her [[tl;dr]] journal. One of the terms in the [[deviantART]] TOS is: NO LINKING TO PORN. As the editor was sadly not around for the [[lulz|drama]] he only has reports of the [[furry]]'s friends commenting "<b>OMG FDD!! THAT WEBSITE IS HORABLEZ! IMMA REPORT U!</b>". Many lulz were gleaned. 	 
	 
	 
*So many lulz were had that firefaggot will become [[an hero]], at least for a little while. MOAR ON THAT SOON!

Unfortunately, firebushfagon is not [[an hero]]. She decided what was best for her [[fags|friends]] was to stay and fight the [[lulz|tyranny]] that was befalling her. She has posted several things, and has started an epic war on the today page of DeviantART. As of this writing we are unsure of what is happening, but we do have pictures.

=== A [[lolcow|LoLCow]] Reborn! ===	 
[[Image:Fddbacklash.jpg|thumb|left|Warning, you will not be able to un-read this.]]	 
FuhDuhDuh has been feeling the pressure as of late. All of her [[faggotry]] has started to catch up with her, as now when she posts journals people are second guessing her. Not everyone is taking her seriously, and this is a great win for most of the internets. We can see from her [[butthurt|journal]] that she is specifically angered by [[ED]], again yet another win for the tubes. Besides calling out [[ED]] to come duke it out with her in person (I believe the RAPE APE is doing this on our behalf anyway) she is also reporting on [[lulz|lulzy]] [[butthurt|hilarity]] that has befallen her in her lifetime. Not only has she been repeatedly [[asking for it|raped]], she has seen her at least two (2) of her immediate family members killed, and has even seen the gunshot wound. This, coming from Fuhduhduh is most likely more emo bullshit, but it could, in fact, be true. If it is, [[lulz]]. If it's not; [[emo]] [[faggotry]], then [[lulz]].

UPDATE: However, ironically, her current signature is:

{{Quote|Ha Ha!! you r ded" (insert point and laugh emoticon here)|[[Hypocrite|Hypocritical]] bitchfag}}
 
'''So of course faggotdickdipper deleted this latest journal of [[lulz]]'''. Notice how it wasn't even linked to, we knew it wouldn't be there for long. But while it was up, it generated prime [[lulz]]. Several things happened in the [[lulz]] category,: the first set of comments was mostly [[asspat|asspats]] and kisses, but then came some weird user who thinks Captain Planet is awesome, who started fucking with her shit. Because of the shit that was started, the journal landed on dA's Today page, and that's when the [[lulz]] rolled in. [[Troll|Trolls]], Admins, [[emos]] and [[fags]] all took part, and in the end, they caused the poor little [[lolcow]] to delete yet another journal. While most of the [[lulz]] were lost in the deletion, we did manage to save a few of the more entertaining lulz.

=== Fuhduhduh's army comes to [[ED]] ===
Furfagon has been noticeably less of a [[lolcow]] in recent days, most likely it is due to the advisement of the DeviantART staff during her [[ban]] trial where she [[asking for it|sucked everyones dick]] just to avoid punishment, then wrote about it in her journal how she found new rapists to keep her [[Centipede filled vagina|self]] happy. But while she has been quiet on the dA front, we are aware of firefagon insurgents getting accounts on [[ED]]; most likely through [[email]] as they are all probably too stupid to understand [[irc]]. So far, two blankers have attacked this page and both have been dealt with appropriately, but if you are feeling vengeful you could go to [[User:Lulzfortehsoul]] and/or [[User:Xdstupidnoobdx]] and leave the furfags what they deserve. Your ever vigilant [[User:Sokevinsays|RAPE SPIDER]] will defend this page until firefagon is raped on national television.

== War am Declared ==	 
[[Image:caps-lock-fury.jpg|thumb|left|CRUISE CONTROL ON CAPTAIN]]	 
[[Image:EPIC JOURNAL.jpg|right|thumb|Intarnets is srs bisns]]	 
In the wee hours of January 18th 2007, the editor of the article set in motion the epic war which is currently plastered all over DeviantARTs today page. There are now 4 journals dedicated to this war:	 
*Firefagon's [[hugbox]] <s>[http://firedarkdragon.deviantart.com/journal/11479173/ Journal]</s> BALEETED!	 
*BadFurDay's counter <s>[http://badfurday.deviantart.com/journal/11477488/ Journal]</s> Baleeted due to B&	 
*ShadowGamers'<s> tribute and proof [http://shadowgamers.deviantart.com/journal/11477185/ Journal]</s> Baleeted bdue to B&	 
*Firefagon's COUNTER ATTACK <s>[http://firedarkdragon.deviantart.com/journal/11481935/ Journal]</s> lol also BALEETED!	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
[[Image:Emptythreats.JPG|left|thumb|As trolls invade her journal, a fantard of FDD is here to remind them that the internet is srs bisns]]	 
	 
	 
	 
So now all of DeviantART has to deal with this shit, and of course, trolls have found which side is the easier to exploit, so many lulz are coming rolling in. The important thing to note is how firefagon's journal is different from the one at the top of this page. Seems like she does care if she is banned, because why else would you take a personal attack out of your journal? Also, the editor has captured many [[lulz]] worthy screencaps of [[faggotry]] and [[fail]] so expect those in the next update. More on this situation as it develops.

=== The Aftermath ===	 
Some time between January 18th and the 19th, 2007 Firefagon had her <b>ENTIRE GALLERY</b> of [[shitty art]] and [[furry]] [[faggotry]] deleted. It is not yet known if this was her decision or the decision of the [[Nazis|dA Staff]], but what we do know is the staff was responsible for the deletion of 70 or more of her so called artworks.	 
	 
After the mass delete, a new account was found, [http://queenfdd.deviantart.com/ QueenFDD]: Her fresh new [[sockpuppet]], which not only had her real name, and her original user name, but also the same icon as the original account. We here at [[ED]] believe the account was created because firefagon's original [[sockpuppet]] was already called out, and would no longer be of any use if she wished to hide. However, several users informed [[ED]] of the developement, and when we went to check in on the situation, we were greeted by a massive [[troll]]. The [[troll]] told us, "<b>Firefagon attempted to hide after the massive attack she preformed against helpless users, we can not allow this to happen. If you are going to act like a retard on the internet, you will be judged accordingly and will not be able to hide, we are always watching."</b> The attack landed firefagon back on the today page of DeviantART so we assume this was the goal of the trolls, to make sure everyone knew about this new [[sockpuppet]]. Also, it should be noted that if firefagon was to switch primarily to the new account, she would be wasting 6 months of subscription time; this alone has generated many [[lulz]].

=== Her Army of Fanbrats ===	 
In a reaction to firefagons [[an hero]] status, and to her [[hugbox]] journal, her army of morons is attacking an innocent user. They believe he has reported firefagons artwork for gore, or art theft or something. Too bad it was really a [[sick fuck]] DeviantARTLET named [http://shadowgamers.deviantart.com/ shadowfag]. He is N THAR JOURNAL, FUCKIN DER SHITS, but I don't think they are smart enough to understand unbroken english. Anyway, on with the rape of [http://badfurday.deviantart.com/ BadFurDay]:

=== The Banhammer Falls ===	 
	 
As the helpdesk starts to answer [http://badfurday.deviantart.com/ BadFurDay]'s harrasment reports, users who trolled his page are getting banned one by one.<br/>	 
Here is a list of B&d users:	 
*<s>[http://cyrilguardian.deviantart.com/ CyrilGuardian]</s> Has returned, but will it last?	 
*<s>[http://zozzyangel.deviantart.com/ zozzyangel]</s> banned, other accounts on suspension.

*<s>[http://cheapsexandcocaine.deviantart.com/ CheapSexAndCocaine]</s> No longer active, but her sock puppet sure is.	 
*<s>[http://lastblackdragon.deviantart.com/ LastBlackDragon]</s> Back from suspension, unfortunately.	 
	 
Despite all the proof gathered by members of the site, Firefagon has not been banned. We here at ED are very confused as to why this is. We here at ED have seen Senior members (Basically a special douche bag, or former staff member) suspended for merely disagreeing with a core staff member, meanwhile, some furry fuck subscriber breaks about 4 or 5 major rules of the TOS and gets off with a mere gallery deletion. See petition section below for the link to help her [[GTFO]] the internet permanently.

===Damn this bitch sucks at killing herself===	 
[[Image:Fddnotdeadyet.jpg|right|thumb|A nice beating is great after attempted suicide!]] As of Tuesday Jan 30, 2007, 8:07 AM Fuhduhduh is back on devianTART [[retarded|alive]] and [[gay|well]]. Although, all is not sunshine and kittens for the self proclaimed queen of hell. After attempting to kill herself by slitting her wrists (the bitch probably goes across the street, not down the road), she was found by her family who proceeded to do what any loving family would do in that situation; <b>PROMPTLY BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HER</b>. Now, knowing fuckdipdick's sense for lying and dramatics, we can safely assume that nothing is wrong, and that she is most likely holding out for moar pageviews. She did tell us about a mysterious note she received, that it turns out was written by [[user:Birthmother|RAPE-APE]], it reads:	 
<br/>	 
{{Quote|this is what you deserve:<br/>	 
''YOU PRETEND TO BE A VICTIM<br/> 	 
''TO GET ATTENTION<br/>	 
''I WILL SHOW YOU THE TRUE MEANING OF RAPE<br/>	 
''THIS WILL NOT STOP UNTIL YOU QUIT OR DIE| a mysterious note}}

===Heartbreak===	 
[[Image:Fddbreakup.jpg|left|thumb|SCANDAL!]] On Tuesday Jan 30, 2007, 10:36 AM, roughly 2 hours after furfagon's return to the internet from [[fake|certain]] [[suicide]], she posted another journal about how her e-boyfriend who lives [[over 9000]] miles away has dumped her. Gee, I wonder why? Maybe it's because you keep getting raped and trying to commit suicide. I know those are huge turn ons for some guys, but I just can't handle it. Maybe her e-boyfriend realized what a [[lolcow]] his supply of internet pussy has always been, but re-examining the situation, this is probably fake too. I'll bet you 10 internets that they get back together before too long; if firefagon can conquer suicide 5 times, how can one man's rejections stop her?	 
	 
===Journal Deletions===	 
Furfagon is now in a happy mood because all her problems were fake. Well, except for the fact that her [[13 year old]] boy friend has e-dumped her, and the fact that the internet in general hates her. She has become such a [[lolcow]] that she is a <b>prime raid target</b>. She makes journals which are all lies, gets all her friends to give her ass pats, then she deletes them and say "whoops, my bad. I don't really feel bad, and none of that stuff really happened. Tee-hee!" But usually in completely broken english. If you consider yourself a friend of fuhduhduh, ask yourself, "why do I put up with these lies and this bullshit?" The answer is because you are [[stupid]] and weak. Maybe if you realized your hero is an [[emo]] [[lolcow]], you would stop being her [[hugbox]] and she would [[suicide|kill herself]] for real. In her current journal she says, "fuck you haters" more or less. That's nice [[retard]], we know you have [[AIDS]] and that you live to spread it, that's why we are here to stop you. Today's happy journal will probably be replaced with some [[bullshit]] about her getting [[rape]]d by a caveman or something.	 
	 
==Editor's Note==	 
	 
Also, Firefagon, in case you are reading this; I am not BadFurDay, I am someone [[Anonymous|completely different and unknown]] to you. I think you are an incredible moron and should be kicked in the head repeatedly until that cum-stain you call a brain activates. English may not be your first language, but that does not give you the right to be a colossal [[douchebag]] to people who can't speak [[Mexican|wetback]]. Die in a fire. --<b>The Editor</b>

== The Fududududududududududursona File ==

So much [[rape|raep]], so many dead people. [[Some argue]] Fuhduhduh just made everything up for the [[Attention Whore|attention]].<br/>
I did some researches and found indications for the attention-theory:<br/><br/>


===Furdurdur and school systems===

[http://inciclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Portada This] is some encyclopedia in which Furdurdur [http://inciclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Usuario:Firedarkdragon has an account], what is shown by her <s>[http://inciclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Imagen:Firedarkdragon.gif uploading a FDD-Picture]</s> which was baleeted. Her profile contains a third-person otherkin-autobiography, stating she was born in 2989 and other clever things.
By google-translating the text in her profile this passage is unrevealed:</s><br/>
{{Quote|In the Secondary one, one left to an institute in the neighborhood of Murcia where human call made contact with the enemy with a variant race cani, it obtained graduated his in E.S.O., and it left that well to study Computer science, to specialize later in Graphical Design.|FuhDuhDuh}}	 

So, what's the problem here?

Maybe, that '''Argentina doesn't have E.S.O.''', but [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Argentina#Characteristics Polimodal/Escuela secundaria]. E.S.O. is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Spain#Educaci.C3.B3n_Secundaria_.28Secondary_School.29 spanish secondary school].

Maybe poor Furdurdur thought Argentina was exactly like spain, as they already have the same official language.

==Crazy Bitch is Tired of Your Trolling==
[[Image:FDDinternettoughguy.jpg|thumb|Summary: [[Diaperfur|BAAAAAWWWWW]]]]
Fuhduhduh announced today that she is sick of all you haters out there. Attacking her, sending death threats, turning her [[furfag]] friends against her. So sick in fact that she did something so revolutionary, so mighty, that all you [[troll]]s will want, nay, <b><i>HAVE</i></b> to stop attacking her. What did she do? Posted another lulzy journal, [[lulz|thats what]]. Oh man, it must be that [[PMS|time of the month]]. [[Furfag]] needs her [[asspat|asspats]] like she needs [[rape|a good cock down the throat]]. And like a fat kid to a cinnamon roll, her army of [[furfags]] came and delivered. The best parts of the journal are where she tries to justify and/or defend herself from issues pointed out by this very article. That makes us here at [[ED]] very happy indeed. Keep on truckin' [[anonymous|anon]]. [[Rape]] that bitch until she [[an hero|kills herself]].  Update (as of July 19 2007)  it seems  Fuhduhduh has found hapieness. This must end immediatly!!!!!!!! (troll plz)
