Dolphy
'''Dolphy''' (Susanne Almanstoetter of Hamburg, [[Germany]]) is yet another crazy, cartoon loving, [[DisneyFan01|Disney fan]] based primarily on DeviantART and [http://fanart.lionking.org fanart.lionking.org]. Now '''26 years old''' Dolphy is still madly in love with [[emo|Jim from ''Treasure Planet'']] (aka [[shit no one cares about|That Disney Film That Tanked and No One Cares About]]). If she draws anything other than [[white trash|Jim]] and her [[fellatio|sucking face]] you better believe it'll be a [[furry]] that she managed to con someone into paying her to do. A challenger has appeared: [[SelauraNetherfield]].

[[Image:EpicSnarkCommSession.gif|thumb|80px|right|Fig.1]]Despite her unrequited love for [[pedo|cartoon boys around the age of fifteen]], Dolphy is a [[retard|loyal friend]] who will flame you to death if one of her internet [[goatse|buttbuddies]] is snarked by a group of jealous [[furfag|furfags]] (Fig.1). [[circlejerk|Birds of a feather flock together]] as is the case with [[Atimon]], Dolphy's BFF and a rabid Timon fangirl who was snarked for her own disgusting [[wtf|Timon pr0n]]. As well as fellow Treasure Planet fan, {{deviantart|dodger-chan|Wolvy}} - another [[furfag]] German girl who used to [[disneyfan01|have a crush on John Silver]] (for some reason) Warning!: Going to Wolvy's DA page will require a dose of eye bleach afterwards.

{{quote|My favorite TP-char: Maybe some of you have noticed that Jim is my very very favorite TP-char,no, my fave-cartoon-char of all times to be exact! *is [[obsession|obsessed]]* Why?Hey,just look at him!No,just kidding,it`s not only his outer appearance (although I think he`s really handsome!) but also his personality.You don`t believe me?When I saw the first screenshots of "Treasure Planet" (that was one year before the movie came to theaters) I thought he was cute but I wasn`t immediately all like "[[rape|Waaahhh!I wanna have him!!!]]".In fact,my obsession developed quite slowly. I saw the movie for the first time and liked him just as I like nearly every [[Disney]]-char.I saw it for the second time and thought he was really cute.I saw it again and couldn`t get him out of my mind from this day on.Jim`s just like me.Stubborn (dunno why that`s the first thing I mention here *g*),often misunderstood,moody (<--me,me,ME!), quite suspicious and careful when he gets to know strange people.And we`re both some kind of [[basement-dweller|outsiders,loners]] and dreamers.(Does anyone here know a way to Montressor?) ; )

Hobbies:
Drawing,music (Disney-soundtracks above all!),cinema,talking and having fun with my friends,Internet,[[fantard|looking at fanart from other Disney-fans]],...and [[fat|eating pizza!!! : D]]|Dolphy}}

===Self Insert, Say WUT!?===

Anyone who has had the misfortune of going through Dolphy's gallery will quickly realize she draws nothing but furries and herself  - most of the time with a [[pedo|fifteen year old boy]] [[lies|who she claims to have made older]]. She openly admits that the girl in these pics is [[self-insert|her illustrated self insert]]. Any artist/author worth their salt knows that [[self-insert]] are [[doing it wrong|a big no-no]]. Because if one person says they don't like the character that automatically means they don't like her. Honestly who would? It's already been discovered that she's a world class, stuck up, bitch. And that her love of a fictional character must not be called into question - but we'll get to that later. 

Dolphy's [[mary sue|self insert]] would not be nearly so [[disneyfan01|god awful]] if she was an accurate self insert - what S.I. is? But it should be noted that her illustrated self looks nothing like her, something most of her ass kissing fans don't get. They only love that Dolphy has curves. What she and the fanherd don't get is that there is a difference between curves and [[fat]]. [[yes|Real Dolphy is fat]], [[lies|drawn!Dolphy is "curvy."]] Compares these to her drawn self. You won't find any similarities.

==Death of a Loved One, trivial compared to a loss of 30 dollars==

[[Image:Lioness_and_Cub_by_dolphy.jpg|thumb||right|All an act]] 
Only Dolphy, with her legion of [[retard]]ed fans, can get away with making herself seem like quite the poor starving artist for losing out on a little bit of money (a mere $30 or so?) while on the flip side, someone lost her mother.

Dolphy whined that one of her commissioners was able to get a free sketch from her oh-so-talented hands. This fan commissioned from Dolphy a picture dedicated to her recently <b>dead mother</b>. Dolphy usually shows her commissioners a sketch before the commissioner has to pay, and this episode was no exception. The commissioner was probably busy burying her <b>dead mother</b>, so paying an internet artist for something as trivial as this probably wouldn't be her top priority, and so she never answered Dolphy's emails.

Most other artists would let it be. Not finish the picture and be done with it--or perhaps even make it a gift for this poor girl. But Dolphy threw a bitch fit. She finished the picture, posted it on her DA site and bitched about how she got ripped off in true [[attention whore]] fashion.

Her fans whined with her in chorus. What cruel person could take advantage of <i>poor</i> Dolphy like that, after all. Screw your <b>dead mother</b>, Dolphy needs that $30 to buy more Jim memorabilia she can [[masturbate]] to!

[[Image:Wowwhatabitch.jpg|thumb|right|she's the victim]]

And of course, Dolphy was eventually paid that money by fellow [[basement-dweller]] Dagerom [http://dagerom.deviantart.com/]. That’s right, some idiot thought, “Oh, the injustice!”, paid Dolphy the money, and will see nothing from it.

Dolphy needs some moar asspats and money, [[plz]].

==The Concept Art Incident==

{{quote|Fuck you. Do you know how many pageviews I have? Do you know how many people watch me? I am a legend. If you wanted to be helpful, you should have said it more politely.|some troll wannabe}}

On August 26, 2008, an [[user:Miskatonic|unfunny newfag]] did it wrong and took a couple pieces of Dolphy's art to [http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=135110 parade in front of] the drawfags over at [[ConceptArt]]. It drew expected criticism on anatomy and perspective to which the obvious fail troll responded with standard [[boring]] and painfully fake [[butthurt]], succeeding in generating a total of zero [[lulz]]. The thread was quickly locked as the Conceptart forumers realized obvious troll is obvious.

The real Dolphy was promptly alerted by her legion of fantards, posting a [http://dolphy.deviantart.com/journal/20180994/ call to arms] in her DA journal. Naturally her fanfucks flooded Conceptart to swamp the mods with hundreds of reports of the offender, and spamming the Conceptart Lounge with Dolphy Support threads. Insults and accusations flew as over 100 comments were posted in her journal, her fans foaming at the mouth, and lashing out at the troll, Conceptart's obvious jealousy at Dolphy's mad skillz, and accusing ED for their sins against Dolphy. The incident ended with with fans offering Dolphy asspats and e-penis sucking to ease the unjust cruelty of having her work unwillingly critiqued.

==Dolphy the Skilled Author==
Dolphy's also into the [[fanfiction]] business! Doesn't that surprise you? But being a very skilled author she would NEVAR write [[Mary Sue]] fics. Here's an example from her "me did writy writy, wanna see?" [http://dolphy.shadowwalkers.net/Fanfictions-Mainpage.htm page]:

{{squote|Jim glanced at her and Sarah had to restrain a chuckle at the helpless attitude of her son. He had really fallen for that girl. But suddenly the opening of the door, which he heard through all the noise around them, caught his attention and his gaze stopped at the person who had just entered the hall.

“Woa…” was all he could say as he stared agape at the girl that was slowly approaching him.

“Do you like it?” asked Dolphy shyly.

She was wearing a low-cut red dress that consisted of a strapless cloak-like top part which was held together on the chest by some darker ribbons. Those ribbons stopped at the waist so the light fabric hung down on both sides and revealed an almost white skirt underneath. As jewelry she had a collar in the same color as the ribbons with a drop-shaped pendant and matching earrings. Her bangs were braided to the back of her head and held together by a flower like barrette.

“You…you look awesome.” Jim managed to say at last with a look that said more than any words could ever do.

Dolphy smiled happily and gazed at the man in front of her. It seemed as if this uniform was made just for him, it made him look even handsomer than he already was. Knowing that she tended to get a little uncomfortable when talking to adults Jim gently grabbed her hand and led her to them. Of course she had already met them a few times but she was still afraid of saying something inappropriate and acting like an idiot. She knew how much Jim and his mother meant to each other and she wanted to be accepted and liked by her.

“Good evening Mrs.Hawkins.” greeted Dolphy shyly but to her relief she smiled softly and shook her hand heartily.

“How often have I told you to call me ‘Sarah’?” she meant in a very friendly way. “Good evening to you,too. Oh, and what a special evening it is! I`m so proud of Jim and you!”

Dolphy blushed and shot a quick glance at Jim to see that he was smiling fondly at her.

“Thank you Mrs.Haw-,…uhm, Sarah. I`m glad you could come.”|Dolphy}}

==Dolphy's latest obsession==

Sometime [[last Thursday]], Dolphy and her [[retarded]] friends decided to make a cartoon. This triggered Dolphy's lastest [[fetish|obsession]], kiwis. That's right, those fucktarded [[bird|birds]] that resemble hairy testicles. You can [[fap|enjoy]] her Kiwi artwork, or, watch her shitty movie [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfdzPfyVXGg/ here]. Please troll at your own convience.

What basically happens in the movie is a stupid bird is [[emo]] because all the other [[furries|animals]] have fuck buddies but he/she/it doesn't. In a fit of emo raeg, it somehow knocks a fruit out of a tree, and decides to fuck it (sex scene tastefully cut out, but plenty of foreplay, post coital and morning after scenes included). The fruit, pissed off at being raped, decides to make a break for it. Some [[fatass]] [[retard]] sporting a [[Pedobear|pedo beard]] grabs the stupid bird and [[Pwnt|tries to kill it.]] The [[retarded]] chicken ends up [[Dat ass|tapping some other trap bird]] who is [[Feminist|offended]], but then gives in and gets fucked. The end.

'''Fun fact''': Dolphy does the voice of the bird in this film. Imagine our Dolphy, [[fat]] and [[fugly]] as ever, in a studio, sighing, purring, and gasping into a microphone. Feel disgusted yet?

'''Another fun fact''': The film is impossible to fap to. Go on. Try it.

==Horseshittastic==

[[Fail|Horsetastic]] is a shitty [[webcomic]] Dolphy conned some [[bitch]] into paying her to do. It's an [[Shit|amazing]], [[Retarded|original]], [[Unfunny|hilarious]] cartoon about horses doing horse things. Her [[Stupid|creative]], [[Traced|totally original]] characters are as follows:

*[[Retard|Stooge]]
*black person
*[[Bitch|Pearla]]
*[[Gay|Folly]]

There's also a little girl but Dolphy doesn't care about her because she's into little boys. For some reason the horses put up with the girl instead of stomping her to death.
