Howard Stern

''not to be confused with convicted felon [[Anna Nicole Smith|Howard K. Stern]], a self-proclaimed full-jew and lover of big [[lie|beautiful]] women.''.

'''Howard Stern'''Jew, a.k.a. "Howard the Schmuck", was once a great [[IRL Troll]] and a self proclaimed "[[lie|half-Jew]]," however is now the biggest [[pussy]] and [[hypocrite]] to have ever lived. He was once the [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|self proclaimed]] Jew, but now the [[old]] [[hebe]] is the newly christened [[lemonparty|King of all Lemonparties]].

Stern is famous for pioneering the [[Rush Limbaugh|talk radio]] format. Stern [[lie|pioneered]] such [[retarded|ingenious]] things such as [[dyke|Lesbian Dial-a-Date]], various lulzy sound clips, the exploitation of retards, dumb [[sluts|actresses/porn stars]], [[crack]] addicts, and other various forms of [[trolling]] and [[lulz]]. To this day, he still tries to [[capitalism|capitalize]] upon this [[fact]], not realizing how much of an [[IRL]] [[old meme]] he's become.

==Early Life==

Howard grew up in Roosevelt, [[Long Island]], where his [[cunt|mother]] forced him to stay in Roosevelt long after it had become a <s>predominantly African-American community</s> black person infested pit of misery and [[failure]]. Stern would constantly be beaten by all of the apes in the concrete jungle on a daily basis. This developed into him making fun of blacks on a daily basis on his show, until he met a certain [[horse|mare]] named [[horse|Beth]]. While in high school, Stern was just [[you|like any other loner nerd]]. He had little to no friends, he smoked grass and tripped on ludes to ease the pain of being a loser, and spent time looking in the mirror at his [[micropenis]], [[unrealistic expectations|believing it would get larger]], like [[you]] do every night.

After having his asshole torn in high school, Stern went to Boston University where he had an uneventful schooling which consisted of creeping up on [[loli|little girls]] like Gollum from [[The Lord of the Rings]] and meeting his soon to be ex-wife. Sometime between molesting loli and being dumped by the loli in the same day, Stern learned <s>to develop a radio personality and become lulz</s> absolutely [[nothing]].

==Radio Career==
[[Image:Howard_Stern.jpg|right|thumb|Despite appearances, she qualifies as a dwarf, retard and a porn star.]]

Stern worked in several markets including [[DC]] and [[Detroit]], because they reminded him of the nigger infested shithole that he lived in as a child. After recovering from his case of [[DO NOT WANT|jungle fever]], Stern moved to [[Jew York]], where he magnified his lulz [[over 9000|beyond a scouter's calculation]]. He was hired on WNBC where he was promptly fired by the head kike for the vicious pursuit of lulz, and the fact that Stern didn't get him his gifilte fish and a [[shota|little boy]] on time.
 
Howard was best known for his work on KROCK, because no one gave a shit about him until they were forced to listen to him when KROCK syndicates replaced their early morning [[Cunt]]ry hits with Stern's radio show. Stern had honed his lulzy skills and didn't give a shit about anyone or anything. Stern was like the radio parallel to [[Andy Kaufman]], which was much needed, as Kaufman had [[Pokemon|evolved]] into a rotting corpse. From 1987-2001, Stern was the supreme lulz master who pissed everyone off without remorse, literally being a trolling machine. However a divorce later, the loss of staff, and an encounter with a tempting [[horse|mare]], Howard was on his way down the path of faggotry.

Enter 2001-2005, Howard was going through the transformation phase, changing much like an innocent child turns into a [[hard gay|rebellious]] [[teenager]], who smokes [[weed]] for the first time (along with a few dicks), and turns into a [[fail]]ure of an adult, leaving [[hermaphrodite|him/her]] in a pile of their own shit, chasing the next high. Howie and his show fell apart much in that fashion, minus the [[angst]] (that would be saved for later). In 2001, Jackie left to be a failure all by his [[dying alone|lonesome]], and was replaced by a walking [[frunz]] factory, [[fat|Artie Lange]]. Stern stopped making fun of minorities, and generally halted much of his trolling, including guests and whoever else he felt like, much to the [[RAGE|chagrin]] of loyal [[fantards]]. In 2004, [[moron|Stuttering John]] left, and was replaced by the contest winner... [[lol wut|and the second place loser]]. By 2005, Stern had fallen off of his mighty peak and crashed, much like Hellen Keller piloting a plane, providing a good segway to what would be the failure that is Sirius.

==[[Serious Business|"Sirius" Business]]==

[[Image:Stern1.jpg|thumb|HAWT.]]

Now he is on Sirius Satellite radio, and therefore a [[Serious Cat|"Sirius" Cat]]. Sirius pays Stern a [[mindfuck|half a billion dollars]] to do his job, which is basically talking about reality shows, burping, and giving praise unto almighty [[Mulatto Jesus]], leading into bitching about [[lolwut|how much getting a half a billion dollars to do nothing sucks]], all the while complaining about [[bullshit|how hard he works]] and how he desperately needs to go home early so his [[horse|wife]] can break in her new bullwhip on him.

Stern is the epitome of a [[hypocrite]]. Every thing that he criticized, made fun of, or did himself, he either lives currently or contradicts. He made fun of old men who married [[loli|girls]] decades younger than them. Whoops. He was not bothered by racial slurs nor racist jokes and took none of it seriously, in fact, it was a common routine in his radio bits, but now he is self censoring on a medium that allows him to say whatever he pleases. He was energetic and cared about his fans previously, but now he could give a shit. Stern, who was once edgy and truly entertaining, now is an unfunny fuckbag riding on a [[rainbow]] of delusion.

A great example of Howie's hypocrisy was the Don Imus case, in which Imus called some nigger women's basketball team nappy headed hoes. Despite this being entirely accurate, Sirius did not want bad publicity so they decided to fire him. A company that supposedly allows free speech [[China|fired someone speaking his mind]]. Hampton's Howie, being the crusader for free speech that he is, who often [[BAWWWWW|complained]] about censorship, showed his true colors [[hypocrite|when he supported the firing of Imus]].

Stern also barely makes it through his shift anymore. Because Stern has such a [[lie|hard, strenuous job]], he believes that he can leave whenever he likes and not even works a whole week while complaining about it. It's like the ultimate form of [[trolling]]. [[retards|The people that still want to listen to him]] can't because Howie only works 4 day weeks now, and takes 20 weeks off a year, along with any bullshit holiday like [[kike|Yom Kippur]]. 

Of course Hampton's Howie still has a loyal fanbase, which consists of mostly retarded [[bro|frat boys]] and college students who get entertained by Hampton Howie's "[[shit|hardcore]]" comedy, most of which doesn't even touch what he did before... while being regulated... even though now he can do [[ALL CAPS|WHATEVER THE FUCK HE WANTS TO]]. 
 
On Fridays, clips from of his old show are played, which, while ultimately more lulzy than Howie is nowadays, are [[old]] news. This is because Howie reclaimed all of his old tapes from CBS. [[lie|Glad to know they're in good hands]]. Along with this, Jackie has a show on one of Howie's channels now, known as [[unfunny|Jackie's Joke Hunt]]. Knowing without Stern, his [[alcoholic|liver]] and professional life would be in the shitter (like it always was), Jackie came back to suck the dick he once loved, but instead of tasting like Jew, it tasted like [[horse]] manure.

== Stern's Show Members ==
[[Image:Howard\'s_mom.jpg|thumb|Robin (left) and another ape. Note how they try to mimic human behavior]] 
[[Image:Bababooey.jpg|thumb|The monkey king Baba Booey takes his throne.]]

'''[[USI|The Current Show Members]]'''
*[[nigra|Robin Quivers]] - Howard's long time sidekick, who's biggest talents are her massive tits, which could keep a space shuttle from taking off. Her only real job on the show is to read tabloid headlines and anything posted on the CNN website. Otherwise all she does is [[masturbate|stroke]] Howie's [[Quasidan's Penis|Quasidan]] sized ego.

*[[wop|Gary Dell'Abate]] (a.k.a. Baba Booey, Boy Gary) - Howard's long time producer who is the epitome of ugly. His traits are massive horse teeth, a fat ass, and bile raisingly bad breath, and his main ability is incompetency at his own job.

*[[lard|Artie Lange]] - A close associate of the [[lulzkiller]] who took Jackie Martling's seat (not writing position) in 2002. His contributions to the show include sleeping, complaining, and going on heroin binges but miraculously not dying. In early 2010, he attempted to [[suicide|kill himself]] by [[emo|stabbing himself nine times]]. Unfortunately, he didn't die. If only he had [[buy a dog|bought a fucking gun]].

*[[alien|Fred Norris]] - A dirty [[Latvia|Latvian]] and who's the only cast member left from Stern's good years other than that cunt Robin. Known for his strange behavior which leads many people to believe he's from Mars.

*[[redneck|Richard Christy]] - Won a contest in 2004 to get Stuttering John's job. Previous to being hired by Stern, he was a loser [[heavy metal|metal]] drummer [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc54DVm3zWE that lived in a storage facility in Florida]. Is in a gay relationship with Sal Governale.

*[[douche|Sal Governale]] - An unfunny faggot who also entered the "[[fail|Get John's Job]]" contest. [[lol wut|He came in second place under Richard Christie, but Howie hired him anyways]]. Known for being a pussy whipped homo, just like Stern and the rest of his cast.
**Those two douchebags above contribute to the show with their [[sarcasm|oh so funny]] phony phone calls. Their job takes the ability to do what a [[13 year old boy]] does except they get payed over a 100 G's to do so. Feel free to [[an hero|kill yourself]] at anytime.

*[[fat ass|Benjy Bronk]] - A fat fuck that replaced Jackie Martling's writing position. Scientists have proven that there is a black hole near the proximity of Earth when Bronk revealed himself to be a huge, round, dense object that sucks the funniness out of everything that comes near him.

Stern also hired a colostomy bag called [[unfunny|Bubba the Love Sponge]], who has the effect of being [[Mr. Hands|raped up the ass by a horse]]. Bubba is known for pathetically bashing Stern for being an old hack (never mind the fact that this is true) while [[dumbass|failing to realize that he's old as shit too]]. Howard also feuded with Bubba as illustrated in these videos [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkHvqYQFB0Q] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo82aHszmcE]. No one listens to Bubba on purpose and if they do, they deserve to be lined up against the wall and shot along with the [[furries]].

'''[[SNCA|Former Show Members]]'''
*[[alcoholic|Jackie "The Jokeman" Martling]] - An unfunny comedian who left the show before [[9/11]] because Jew-boy wasn't willing to cough up a little more dough. Although unfunny in stand up, Jackie contributed by being the show's punching bag for his shitty personal life, by being a writer, and also through his [[alien|inhuman]] laughter.

*[[magick|Billy West]] - A voice actor who does many of the voices on Futurama and did Ren & Stimpy. On the show, he provided voices of many people, mostly to troll them and even other members of the show. Back when ball busting was common fare.

*[[loser|John "Stuttering John" Melendez]] - A drunk and general waste of life that mooched off of the show an made an ass of himself in general. He did interviews asking ridiculous and insulting questions to celebrities and wannabe celebrities to troll them. [[fail|He went on to be the announcer for Jay Leno]].

The reason these three left the show [[lie|is widely varied for each of them]], as displayed below:
*Billy West - Left over money in 1995.
*Jackie Martling - Left over money in 2001.
*Stuttering John - Left over money in 2004.

As you can see, Stern has a reputation for being [[lie|generous and giving]], and is in no way Jew.

==[[horse|Beth-O]]==
[[Image:Horse Tranny Beth.jpg|thumb|No amount of [[eye bleach]] will remove this image from your mind.]]

Hamptons Howie's most recent [[horse|wife]] that he met in [[at least 100 years ago|2000]] a year after he separated from his first wife. Since then, Howard has turned [[libertarian|his political views]] around [[liberal|180 degrees]], and has moved to the shithole Hamptons on Long Island, where he spends his time being pussy whipped and watching gay reality shows. [[lie|But don't worry, Beth-O loves Howard and didn't just marry him for his millions.]] 

She was a model that Howie got an instant [[boner|hard on]] for. After a divorce with his original wife, Alison, Stern was again on the prowl for loli, just as in his youth, and especially one who would have been an infant on his first loli escapade. This made [[horse|Beth]] his first choice. Being short on looks himself, Stern thought this empty headed cunt was a lucky catch, [[lie|as she didn't marry him or even consider being with him due to his fame and incredible amount of money]].

Howard often speaks of his wonderful [[horse|wife]] very fondly. She has him under control much like [[Hypnotoad]]. If anyone so much as mentions her in a negative light, Stern goes [[batshit|ballistic]]. He even threatened to fire ass pirate Sal for doing so. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9HpJmNqGvs Srsly]. This could be used for trolling purposes if Stern could be easily [[molested|touched]], unfortunately, [[this is why we can't have nice things|we can't always have nice things]].

Start placing bets now, because once Howard leaves radio when his 5-year contract with Sirius is up, [[horse|Beth]] is going to leave Howard in an [[ugly]] divorce. Proving how much [[horse|she]] truly loves and respects Howard, and is in no way a two-bit cunt.

[[horse|She]] also had a small stint hosting a show on [[G4]].

==Items Found In His Nose==
*Jimmy Hoffa's body.
*A dirty [[Fleshlight|Pocket Pussy]].
*His misplaced sense of humor.

==Enemies==
*[[Don Imus]]
*[[Opie and Anthony]]
*[[George W. Bush]]
