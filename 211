Acne
[[Image:Acne_omfgwtf.jpg|thumb|Acne makes you [[fugly]]]]
'''Acne''' is a ''hilarious'' [[disease]] experienced by [[at least 100]]% of [[teenagers]] and a handful of very unlucky adults.

== History ==

It is [[common knowledge]] that approximately 98% of [[LiveJournal]] users have acne. [[Internet disease]] can sometimes suppress the symptoms of acne with the help of blur and heal brush enzymes. 

Every [[nerd]] and [[geek]] in the world has acne, which is why they can never get [[girlfriend]]s or [[boyfriend]]s. [[Half Life 2|Theoretical physicists]] have proposed that by finding [[photoshop|a cure for acne]] the world would have less [[emo]]s and [[goths]], as these two groups are populated exclusively by [[angst]]y adolescents who want an excuse to wear an inch-thick layer of makeup.

People with acne are often called 'pizzafaces' because of their [[purportedly|purported]] resemblance of their faces to pepperoni pizza. [[Goatse|Gross]].

== Why Acne is Hilarious ==

: It's [[painful]].
: It's [[ugly]].
: It's on your face.
: It causes death after 7 days
: It has [[sex|sex]] on your face without using a condom, creating more acne

=== Why Else ===
* Approximately 100% of [[azn|asian people]] have acne  
* The shit people with acne make up when you ask them: "Hey, what happened right there" and point to a zit on their face

==Acne Online==

At some point a bunch of ugly retards decided to make their own [http://www.acneforum.com/ acne forum]. Trolling the forum is very easy.
*Start a thread saying something like "I need help to get rid of a zit i have on my nose, I want to pop it but i do not want to look like one of those disgusting people that are all scarred up from constantly picking at their acne".
*Start a thread saying that soaking your face in hydrogen peroxide for 10 min got rid of your acne scars for 2 weeks. Hydrogen peroxide is just a weak bleach and WILL turn skin significantly lighter for a day or so.
*Post about how much you "lance" (acanese for poke) your acne and soak it in rubbing alcohol. When everyone replies on how much you should not do that just respond on how you are going to try a new lancing method, repeat.
