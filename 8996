White Knighting

<BR>
'''White Knighting''' refers to the fucktarded online defense of [[attention whores]], [[DevianTART]] "[[Fag|Artists]]", or [[Douche|douchebags]], all under the pretense of supposed compassion for some sort of benefit. Generally, this action occurs on websites like [[DeviantArt]], [[Stickam]], [[YouTube]], and other places which foster self-proclaimed [[Internet Celebrity|Internet Celebrities]], who are protected by people that seek some sort of benefit in return- be it secondhand popularity, sex, or just [[attention whore|attention]]. This invariably results in making the defended look even dumber, making the defender look pitiful, and making the entire situation one big clusterfuck of [[fail]]/[[lulz]]. [[Last Thursday|Recently]] there seem to be some faggots who white knight for the sake of it. Complete opposite of [[troll]].

== Psychology ==

Boiled down to simple terms, white knighting is when some idiot protects some other idiot on the internet, presuming doing so will make them look better or doing so will earn them respect/attention from the [[Attention Whore|maiden]]. The most stereotypical form of White Knighting is some basement-dwelling nerd on a popular social networking/camwhore site like [[Stickam]], or [[JewTube]] defending some popular girl he has a crush on in order to possibly win her favor, and thus get her to [[unrealistic expectations|fuck him]]. This can also apply in a lesser sense to random users on various message boards who defend other members of the board (generally higher ranking members with higher post counts or mods) to look [[Gay|"cool"]] or "in the know".

In the real world, protecting those who are harassed is entirely normal and acceptable. However, on the [[Internets]], protecting someone who posts [[gay]] [[furry]] [[shit]] is tantamount to taking a shit on someone's chest, as Internet culture dictates (rightly so) that pretty much everything must be hated/parodied. Where suffering and bullying in the real world is the realm of [[an hero|heroes]], those same things online end up only being hilarious- because you are never forced to do anything online. White Knighting thus exposes itself as a pathetic attempt at social mobility-

In short. It takes balls to protect someone from bullying because there is the off chance you might actually engage the oppressor.But it takes a dumbass to protect someone online who brought it upon themselves with words. If you want the respect of the trolls, you have to fight them in [[IRL]]

In most cases, a White Knight will also possess whatever crippling social disorder their victim has, providing him or her with all the empathy they need to create a special online [[friend|friendship]] with their newfound chum. However, when this bond is between members of the opposite sex (where the White Knight is typically male), the relationship goes from savior to one of predator-and-prey, where the White Knight desperately attempts to woo their "[[girlfriend]]", usually unsuccessfully. The image of the dashing [[/b/|/b/tard]], sweeping their [[Asperger's]]-diagnosed damsel off in their tattoo-covered, [[Redneck|hillbilly]] arms, is too powerful an incentive to resist, so they go to great pains to flatter their victim and make them feel loved. This generally leads to the [[Nice Guys|"Nice Guy Syndrome"]], where the White Knight later goes on [[Livejournal]] and cries about how he's ''so'' nice and ''so'' helpful and yet the girl of his dreams doesn't love him because she's off fucking [[cooldude]].

White Knighting is also sometimes connected to [[Internet tough guys]], as oftentimes said White Knights will try to attack anyone who threatens their respective [[Internet Celebrity]] ferociously, threatening anyone with [[Threats of violence|physical violence]]. The typical ''Modus operandi'' is to TYPE IN ALL CAPS, swear incessantly, post huge blocks of text that make Ulysses look like fucking bathroom reading, brag about your job/life/car/muscles, and claim that your girlfriend is hot and totally not a [[Sweet Eva|meth addict]].

==/b/'s Official White Knight Appears==


On the sacred date of 08/04/09 a post was made that shook [[/b/|/b/tards]] from their [[masturbation|fapping]] and downloading of [[cp]]. A get was made that announced the [[video game]] character Jin Saotome was to be their official white knight and a [[meme]]. Rather than screaming and gnashing their teeth like [[asspie]] [[Fag|faggots]] that had missed their mid morning nap, the collective reply was to actually invite the new knight to the [[4chan|round table]]. After all Jin wore all white, screamed at the top of his lungs when addressing people, stood for the side of good and overreacted at everything. There could be no purer a white knight than he. [[Rule 34]] was instantly satisfied when Jin's massive cock of [[moralfag|righteousness]] was produced. 

Controversy arose that the video game character Jin could be confused with /toy/'s [[Jin Saotome]] until it was realized that he was just as pure and righteous as the character's name he stole, so this mattered not. It was later confirmed that 4chan's rotational banner of Jin was made by the same [[Wapanese|individual]], intertwining their destinies even further in the eyes of /b/.

== White Dames? ==

[[Woman|Female]] white knights have also existed on the Internet, in defense of the same types of people. However, most of these [[Moralfag|moralfagesses]] seem to not only put up cybersword and cybershield against men but other women as well, which asks the question: are these white knightettes [[bisexual]]?

Also, [[Some argue|it is the finding of this writer]] that woman white knights tend to take their estrogen-driven chivalry [[IRL]]. [[True|This is annoying]], and will cause real men to flee quickly. Final result: [[butthurt]], without actual [[sex]].

disregard taht; THERE ARE NO WIMMINZ ON THE INTERNETS!!!!!!!!!!

Here the code from DragonHeart (The movie)

    ...inside the circle of the table,
    under the holy sword,
    a knight must swear he will obey
    to the eternal code,
    eternal as the table,
    a ring bound to honour.

    A knight is sworn to valor,
    his heart knows only virtue,
    his blade defends the helpless,
    his might upholds the weak,
    his word speaks only truth,
    his wrath undoes the wicked.

    The right can never die,
    if a man still remembers him.
    Words are not forgotten,
    if a voice pronounce them clearly,
    The Code always shines,
    if a heart preserves it brightly...

    The Old Code....
