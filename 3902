I Can Has Cheezburger?
[[Image:Original_I_can_has_Cheezburger.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The original [[Happycat]].]]
'''"I Can Has Cheezburger?"''' is the banal, ripped-off name for a site where the [[:Image:IQ_chart.jpg|borderline-retarded]] masses of the world first learned of what [[4chan]] has long known as [[Caturday]]. It was started in January 2007 by Eric Nakagawa, a rather [[Aspergers|inarticulate]] [[AZN]] in [[Hawaii]], with a picture he "[[theft|found on the internet]]." In an effort to simplify and make more accessible and mainstream [[Physics|the concept]] of Caturday, which he himself could not grasp, Nakagawa coined the term "lolcat"

== The death of Caturday as we know it? ==
[[Image:IMINURMEMES.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An image macro]]
In June 2007, "I Can Has Cheezburger" (ICHC) became a partner with Photobucket, which is owned by [[Fox News|Fox Jews]] (who in turn got [[owned]] by [[Anonymous]], but that's another story). The widely used Photobucket posted a link to a the "ICHC Factory," where users could upload and create their own "Lolcats" and submit them for the rest of [[You|the dullards]] from [[Web 2.0]] to create their weak version of joy and at the same time taking every long running Caturday pic they could find and slapping their fucking ICHC watermark on it to be an eyesore for the ages. Many long-time 4-channers yielded to the Photobucket juggernaut and claimed that Caturday was now dead. This assessment was premature. While it is true that your grandmother and your 9-year-old nephew and your developmentally-delayed cousin Shirley are now gurgling at "Lolcats" they receive from each other in the e-mail, they learn nothing from these [[fail|cheapened]], [[Inadequacy|dumbed-down]] image macros, and could not even begin to grasp the [[Cthulhu|real power]] in Caturday's casual elegance.

==Not for amateurs==

Later in 2007, ICHC and Nakagawa were [http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jul2007/sb20070713_202390.htm profiled by Business Week], one of the most [[tl;dr]] magazines in America. In the article it was revealed that Nakagawa is currently making [http://finance.yahoo.com/currency/convert?amt=6000&from=USD&to=AUD&submit=Convert close to $6,000 USD] in ad sales from the site each month, with over 500,000 page views daily. This is yet another confirmation that the Internets are [[serious business]].  Many people find it funny that someone who enjoys "Caturday" gets in an uproar over this site.  This could be compared to a [[Star Trek]] Fan getting upset over something involving [[Star Wars]].


==Lulz was corrupted==

[[Image:complete_spider_experts.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Look guys, we're stealing [[Meme|memes]], claiming that they're ours, and [[capitalism|selling]] them!]]

Predictably, other low-imagination opportunists joined the looting of beautiful memes, [[corruption of LOL|corrupting the lulz]] therein and turning it into "lol." The name "Caturday" itself was stolen for another "[[pun|copy'''cat''']]" site called "[http://www.katurday.com/ Katurday]." Then someone targeted many of the other *chan memes, such as "[[A cat is fine too]]," distorting them completely so that they would only appeal to retards in the [[irl|real world]] as opposed to online. Strangely it escapes the grasp of most people crying over this phenominon that the chans stole the memes from [[SomethingAwful]]([[grinman]]) and [[YTMND]]([[nedm]]) in the first place.

[[Image:Ihateslolcats.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Limecat]] is not pleased with lolcats.]]
This phenomenon of "[[mainstream|mainstreaming]]" what once was rare and amazing is nothing new.  For example, the "mainstreaming" of the Internet itself. This allows many infantile [[fucktards]], such as those found communities like [[4chan]], to find a voice and make themselves feel important and noteworthy in such important matters as LOLCats. Which is of course far from true, when really they probably shouldnt even be breathing.

[[Image:Tubgirlicanhascheezburger.jpg|thumb|right|Lulz]]

If it is any consolation, these abusers will never truly understand that which they mock and defile with their weak, shallow imagery and [[infantilism|infantile]] blurbs. Also, they are [[asking for it]].  Seriously.

== Habbo steals LOLCATS ==

The flying monkey circus of [[Habbo Hotel]] are at it again. To try to "fit in" they have started using this to draw [[moar]] and [[moar]] children to keep their massive underground pedo gig going. There was a link to the article... but the article was deleted.

==One Step Too Far & The Final Solution==

On Friday the 25th of April, a thread appeared on [[Ebaumsworld]]. It included a link to an interview on wired.com with the canihascheezburger [[fgts]]. In what can only be described as an act of [[pun|'''cat''']]astrophic [[stupidity]], they dropped [[dox]] on themselves, and '''claimed responsibility for the creation of Caturday [[memes]]!'''

See the interview here: http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/04/behind-the-me-3.html

Agents of [[/b/|ebaumsworld]] were enraged. "[http://roflcon.org/ ROFLcon]? WTF is ROFLcon? [[Kirbyraeg|'''RAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!'''"]] they decried. The rusty [[internet hate machine]] was revved up again, and in a few hours full [[dox]] had been compiled, and harassment began.

Within seconds [[Hackers_on_steroids|a crack team of engineers]] were working on a final solution for the Caturday thieves. Weapons were deployed to all foot soldiers willing to fight for the dignity of [[Ebaumsworld]]. But as always, nothing happend because [[4chan]] is little more than a paper lolcat.

==LulzFTW is a corruption of lulz==

To further [[plagiarism|capitalize]] on the [[lie|originality]] and success of LOLCats and [[nerd rage|placate]] the anonymous masses, the [[thief|creators]] of LOLCats launched lulzftw.com to promote their [[epic fail|new book of image macros]].  [http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=29749726217 Failbook group] [[San Francisco|SFags]] have an opportunity to [[raid|meet]] the [[lie|creators]] of LOLCats in their city on September 21.

== [[Anti-lulz]] ==
[[Trying too hard]] coupled with [[unfunny]] [[anti-lulz]] [[rape|killed]] [[Caturday]].  Behold, the  deepest depths of failure on the internets:

<br>
[[Image:Canhascatfood.png|center|frame|Fuck off troll!!]]

== Time isn't laughing, either ==

Time magazine, following the insufferable internet trend of divvying up meaningless factoids and opinions into their very own Top Ten list, [http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1725323_1727645_1727655,00.html lists Lolcats as the #4 most overrated blog on the internet.]

== Proper methods of trolling ICHC ==

* Post "FIRST!" on every [[Fail|submission]]. While [[Unfunny]], it will generate a lot of butthurt from "the [[queers|regulars]]"
* Sign up for a new account and kindly [[haet|reject]] the welcoming committee that forms when they realize you're new to ICHC.
* Link to [[Zippocat]].

== Women and ICHC ==

[[Image:Omgyaymysubms.png|left|]]

[[Image:Lolcatsbymilfs.jpg‎|thumb|right|150px|A typical ICHC submission from a [[16-year-old_girl|female.]]]]
As the ICHC plague grew and grew, even women, mainly 40 year old [[milf|moms]], began learning to use the power of the internet to browse ICHC for lolcats, leaving the kitchen for hours on end, forcing many men to [[rape|confront]] them. And as if thats not bad enough, many of these woman lurk ICHC like theres no tommorow, turning what used to be mildly [[Stupid|funny]] captions, into stupid, [[Gay|cute]] captions that only the inferior and over-[[emo|emotional]] female [[vagina|mind]] could conceive.

[[Image:Milfcatprps2.jpg‎|thumb|right|150px|An ICHC submission from [[you|your]] mom.]]
[[Image:Nomoarlolcatz.jpg|center|frame|[[Rape|Confrontation]] is the first step to fixing your lolcat-addicted whore of a wife.]]

However this milfy-addiction to ICHC leaves a great oppurtunity to produce many good [[lulz|laughs]] when properly trolled. See "Proper methods of trolling ICHC".
