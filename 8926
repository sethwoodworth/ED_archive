Watermark
{{needsmoar|drama}}

[[Image:Ebaumtag.gif|frame|[[Ebaum]] actually didn't create this at all, he stole it and the entire site right out from under its previous owner, Evelyn Baumsfeld.]]
A '''watermark''' is a mark added to an [[image]] by [[website|websites]] who don't own the [[copyright]] on that image or have any right to claim it as their own. This is done purely to be a tremendous [[asshole]] by inconveniently forcing anyone else who wants to use the image to either find the watermark-free image that was originally stolen by the site, or to try and remove it in [[Photoshop]]. Normally, [[butthurt]] TARTlets or Ebaum whores will use this to protect their "art" or "work."

The trick is to find the image that was '''previously''' stolen. Yes, usually watermark whores steal images, put their [[goatse]] watermark on it and write journal entries on how someone always steals "their" work. The sad thing is, people usually believe them until a [[hardcore]] [[Internet tough guy|internet gangster]] like yourself [[ninja]]-kicks their internet ass and shows them the original stolen pictures (or just points out their art really does suck). This usually turns into decent [[drama]].

==How to be a Watermark Whore==
[[Image:Wrrrry.jpg|thumb|Image with the original overlayed. Note the watermark, cause it's [[lie|my talent!!]]]]
*Steal/borrow an image, either from [[google|the library]] or a good artist who has a lot of pics and doesn't care what you do
*Use [[photoshop|shoop]] and send up your "talented" logo, usually around 50% opacity
*Save it and upload it to your site (cause you worked so hard to layer the watermark!)
*Pat yourself on the back, you [[Cunt|smart person!]]
*[[????]]
*[[Profit|PROFIT!]]

It's hard to remove watermarks. But usually watermarks are on shitty pictures. And it's kind of for movies. Moving on..
