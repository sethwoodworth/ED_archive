'''You Forgot Poland''' is many things in one. It's a [[redundant]] statement from our glorious ex-[[W|president]]. It's the reason why [[W]] beat [[John Kerry]] in the 2004 election. It's a played-out meme on YTMND. And to some, it's a [[No life|way of life]].

==Who could forget Poland?==
Good question. With all the [[Polish Crash|news]] and [[Polandball|jokes]] about [[Poland]], it seems hard to forget about that annoying little lump of land. But, believe it or not, way back in the time before [[ED]], people didn't really hear about Poland every day. They would hear stuff about [[Katrina|actual]] [[Iraq|problems]] in [[US|places]] [[UK|that]] [[China|matter]].

{{morphquote|forgotpoland1|background-color: none;|font-weight: bold;|When we went in, there were three countries, [[Great Britain]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]]. That's not a [[What|grand coalition]]. We can do better.|John Kerry|<big>Well actually you forgot Poland!</big> And now there's thirty nations involved, standing [[Mantrain|side-by-side]] with our [[Idiot|American troops]]. And [[Lie|I honor their sacrifices]], and I [[Bawww|don't appreciate it]] when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.|George Bush}}

The disease started on October 1, [[2004]], when the user barbarian posted a simple site with a picture of W looking [[stupid]] as usual, and the infamous quote. If he knew what wrath he had brought on YTMND, he would have [[Suicide|shot himself]]. It took the usual route of YTMND "fads", but shortly after, several YTMND [[13-year-old boy|users]] decided to turn it into a fucking [[cancer]] that would plague YTMND to this very day.

==Forgot Poland Army==
The Forgot Poland Army is a vicious pack of [[13-year-old boy]]s that practically run YTMND. Their tactics are the same as most [[YouTube]] partners, making a misleading title, telling people to [[Youtube|VOAT %]], and making horrible [[pun]]s in the site title. But the sites themselves resemble [[Youtube Poop]], using [[Earrape|highly distorted]] sound, typical [[Meme|Fad]] sound clips, and horrible [[Photoshop]]ping.
