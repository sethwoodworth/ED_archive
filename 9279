The '''<s>YouTube</s> Rape Video''' is a highly sought after [[crap|mobile phone]] video called '''"mashin"''' (aka '''http://youtube.com/watch?v=cRF9VObv-ec''') of an apparent [[IRL]] [[date rape]] rumoured to be currently on the Internets somewhere other than [[YouTube]]. 

Approximately 600 pervs saw the video on [[YouTube]] when it was posted in November 2007, before somebody [[flag]]ged it and it was pulled...three months later in February 2008.

=The New Holy Grail?=
[[Image:TDOTKRAYZ.png|center|800px]]
The video has yet to be found and is now highly sought after by the hordes of [[anon|Anons]] for whom real pr0n with good lighting and hot chicks just doesn't cut it. [[You|Hundreds]] were [[rickroll|x'rolled]] seeking it, yet none have found it despite the fact that it's currently on at least 100 [[torrent]] sites.

This video has been dubbed "The New Holy Grail" by a few faggot Anons, but as yet not as many people know about it as the original [[Holy Grail]].

==History==

In mid-February, 2008, a 25-year-old mother from [[Pakistan|South London]] was brutally gang raped in front of her 2-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son after [[party hard|partying hard]] with three [[13-year-old boys|teenage boys]].

According to the [[victim]]:

They came round with a neighbour [[pwnt|I trusted]] and I had no problems with them [[cum|coming]] in for a while.}}{{tinyquote|I [[troll|opened a bottle of champagne]] I had, [[asking for it|to be social]]. We were drinking and I had one glass, then in seconds I began to feel [[sexy|weird]]. They had [[drugs|spiked]] my drink and then they [[Rape|raped]] me. I was totally [[drunk|paralysed]]. They were really hurting me and I knew something was seriously wrong but couldn’t do anything. I was raped all night. [[list of sex moves|It was torture]].}}{{tinyquote|They raped me in front of my daughter who was [[BAW|screaming for me]], but I couldn’t move. They [[gangbang|took turns one after another]] and carried on all the way through the night until the morning.}}{{tinyquote|Afterwards they called me a [[slag]] and a [[bitch]]. It was dark when they started and light by the time they filmed me. I was shocked when I saw the [[YouTube]] video a couple of weeks ago to see it was light. I had heard there was a video of what happened but [[trolls remorse|couldn’t bring myself]] to look at it before then.|[[Slapper]]}}

==[[TL;DR]]==

tl;dr: After trying to get three [[13 year old boy|teenagers]] drunk on champagne, -"just to be social"- she ended up getting <u>her</u> drink spiked with [http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/concern/ghb.html  GHB] and was raped for 14 hours in front of her kid whilst [[porn|being filmed]] on a cell phone camera. The video was subsequently posted on YouTube under the account of '''[http://youtube.com/user/TDOTKRAYZ TDOTKRAYZ]''' where it stayed up for at least 5 minutes before getting [[anti-lulz|flagged]] and [[baleeted]].

When [[B|/b/]] found out about this video, they all ran around screaming '''"ZOMG!!! TORRENTS PLZZ!"''' until some [[basement dwelling]] e-tective found a short-lived [http://209.85.173.104/search?q=cache:eRC-RSMCgaoJ:hk.youtube.com/user/TDOTKRAYZ+TDOTKRAYZ link] using [[Googlecash|Google]]. Meanwhile, some idiot [[Eurofag]] found the video using one of several [http://youtube.infamousx.com/ Deleted YouTube Finder] posted the video on their [[Bebo]] account (which I'm guessing was pwnt sometime [[last Thursday]]). And no, the video is not the one with the [[arab|Iran girl]].
