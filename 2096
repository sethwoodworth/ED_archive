[[David Motari]] is a [[Christian|pious]], [[mega_ultra_super_genius|patriotic]] 24 year old [[serial killer|ex-Marine]] from [[Seattle]], [[Washington]], who saved [[America]] from [[Terrorism|utter destruction]] by tossing a [[Muslim|terrorist]], who was cleverly disguised as a [[pwnt|puppy]], over a cliff.

David's fellow marines recorded his [[lulzy|valorous]] act and uploaded it to the [[internets]] for others to appreciate. Thankfully, they also state his name in the video so all who viewed it would know just exactly who to [[H8|thank]].
<video type="liveleak" id="1a2_1201076580" width="420" height="360" frame="true" position="center"/>




==Reaction==
The shit promptly hit the fan. The [[time paradox|morning after]] the video was uploaded, the story was broadcast by the mainstream media and the entire nation [http://icestream.bonnint.net:8000/seattle/kiro/2008/03/03042008154934.mp3 rushed to congratulate David and his family for his valorous deeds]. Modest soldier that he is, David was unable to cope with the massive outpouring of [[hate mail|support]] and quickly [[delete fucking everything|moved]] to regain his [http://www.bebo.com/DavidMotari anonymity].

[[YouTube]] [[Unwarranted self-importance|celebrity]] [[Matthew Lush]], or Gay God, made [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc8AhymzcSk this video] to protest the throwing of de puppy. [[Fail|This is his only video]] concerning the [[W|bullshit]] [[Iraq war]].

==Hoax Theories==
[[Some argue]] that the whole incident was actually a [[Holocaust|hoax]]. They claim that you can see the real dog being switched with a stuffed toy, or that the dog was already dead. [[Computer Science III]] majors are fully confident that the video has been augmented, and that—at the least—the puppies plaintive cries have been added for dramatic effect. Some have even called in to question the puppy's trajectory, arguing that it was [[Ejaculate|hurled impossibly far]]. 

Of course, [[Bullshit|this makes perfect sense]]. Obviously, it's [[Retarded|laughably simple]] to:
#Bring a [[Plushie|stuffed puppy]] into a [[Iraq|war zone]]
#Find a puppy that looks exactly like it
#Perfect a split-second [[Swap.avi|handoff]] of the two
#Frame the hand off perfectly on helmet-cam video
#Dub in the sound of a [[BAWWWW|poor little frightened puppy]] over ambient noise
#Finish war so you can go home and troll by leaking the video onto the [[internets]].
#[[????]]
#[[PROFIT!]]

Motari is an obvious troll who would rather explain [[I did it for the lulz|why]] he threw the puppy and see all of his personal accounts hacked rather than confess to his obvious fabrication. [[Srsly|Seriously]], it's obvious that this video could only be a hoax.

===Dave's Statement===
[[Image:David_Bebo.jpg|thumb|He's sorry if you can't see that he did that dog a favor, you jerk.]]
{{squote|I want to clear somethings up before tomarrow [[(sic)]]. This might be hard to believe but I am sorry about the dog. At the time I just really didn't care. I was dealing with my own inadequacies with a tiny penis and never being able to satisfy a man. And when you are constantly under fire sometimes people develop a different sence  (sic) of humor than what others are used to. 
That video was from over  a year and I don't know who put it out there but it wasn't me. It has been a really hard day. I don't know how they got my information but someone got all my information and i had to disconnect my parents and my boyfriends phone not to mention i had to redo my myspace because it got hacked.

{{squote|[[cool story sis|The Marines may be all about work but they have fun as well. A graduate from MHS joined the Marines right out of high school. They were stationed in Hawaii doing missions up in the mountains when they got hungry. They came out of the woods and found a house and took down the address to call a pizza place. The delivery man didn’t want to come all the way up there because it was really far. Finally they convinced him to. The Marines waited in the trees and bushes until the pizza man came. When the delivery man pulled up, all the Marines jumped out of the bushes with their face paint on and their guns. The pizza man was too scared to get out of the car! They gave him an extra tip for going through the hassle to go that far. So after, they hopped back in the bushes and ate their pizza]].|David's sister; found on [[MySpace]]}}

{{squote|The united states has 100's of millions of people transfered from airports to border regions in the U.S. every year. The country has a static population of approx 300 million. Because of the efficiency and scope of the U.S. tranportation system its estimated around 1 million people are transfered or stay in the U.S. forced into some form of slavery. 
Keep in mind [[wrong|1.5 million people is equal to about 1 PERCENT of the population]] (It is 0.5% dipshit). Many prostitutes are forced into their profession, many immigrants are promised good jobs in the U.S. and are forced into sweat shops they cannot leave. Keep in mind just last month a NYPD police officer and his wife forced a teen runaway into slavery they would pimp her at parties if she left they promised kill her. They think the whole lasted at least a year. In Texas a gang of [[niggers|teens]] kidnaped teen runaways and held them in hotels forcing them into prostitution again death was the threat of leaving. There are hundreds of these cases uncovered but there are many more we never hear about. Unfortunately less than half a percent of population is more than a million. That means 99.5 percent of our poplulation will never be forced into some form of slavery. I'm concerned about that half of a percent. Not some dead
puppy found on the side of a road and thrown.|[http://www.youtube.com/user/thinser thinser, YouTube asshole & mathematician.]}}

{{quote|David, I forgive you.

We sit here, back home, safe and sound, and it’s easy to see your actions and be disgusted. I certainly was.

It’s easy to criticize from behind the safety of a keyboard. . . .

You will probably face some [[Rape|disciplinary action]] from the Marines.  Conduct unbecoming a Marine.  I hope you are not dishonorably discharged for 16 seconds.

I hope, I truly hope, that once you are back home, out of the service, that [[No|this will be put in the past]].  You are so young.  You have so much in front of you, [[Lynching|so much to look forward to]]. I don’t want your life to be ruined for [[Cum|16 seconds]].

I know I’m not the only one to feel this way.|[http://blog440.wordpress.com/2008/03/07/conduct-unbecoming-or-forgiving-david-motari/ Blog440], missing the point}}

{{squote|if i had a chance to kill him, here is how i'd do it:

First, while naked, i'd tie him up by both arms and tie his legs as far apart as i can get them

then i'd shoot him in the kneecaps.

after he finished squirming, i'd get garden shears and slowly cut off his penis

after all his swearing and shit, i'd shove it in his mouth and tape it shut

Then i would gouge [spelling?] out his eyes

i'd shove both of them up his ass, along with a 6 inch metal pole

then i'd take a straightedge and start slicing around his nipples

then i'd take a blade and cut out his nipples and place them in his eye sockets

then I thought "Nah forget it, yo holmes to Bel-Air!"

I pulled up to the house about seven or eight

I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo Holmes smell ya later!"

I looked at my kingdom I was finally there!

{{squote|Really? So you know what dogs sound like when they are thrown wildly, you sick fuck? You've never heard a dog yelping? ARE YOU SERIOUS? Fuck man, think before you post!
The dog isn't moving because the back of its neck is being held, just like a mother holds it in its mouth; its a natural reaction for the dog to go limp and not move.

They can't fight back, and they got their lame excuse, '[[Metal_Gear_Solid|war changes people]]', yeah it does; it makes their lives screwed up but it doesn't make them able to kill a puppy. 'Ike how can war make you kill a puppy? It can make you hate a certain, (stutter) certain people, like the ones you are fighting, I don't think it makes you kill a puppy, I think its just retarded.

  {{quote|  A moment of using bad judgment does not portray the true character or integrity of my son David. It does not show that when he was home on leave, the first thing he would do was buy soft dog food for our aging dog Bear.

It does not show the kind and gentle heart of a young man who served his country for 3½ years of his life. Nor does it show the battles he fought in Afghanistan or Iraq; that he fought for the freedom of the people of Afghanistan, Iraq and the United States of America!

The video released does not alter our opinion of him. The sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening. Life goes on no matter how much grief we may be in. My son’s life will go on as will ours.| Motari's mom - Proving that there is such a thing as a face only a mother could love.}}
