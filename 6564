Posting in an epic thread
'''Posting in an [[epic thread]]''' is one way a [[newfag]] can cling onto Internet fame like a flea on a [[buy a dog|dog]] corpse rotting in a [[New York City]] gutter unhosed since the late [[1990s]] - and last just as long.  The basic formula for determining the [[e-penis|power]] of one's PIAET to claim Internet [[famous|fame]] can be expressed as:

POWER = ET/(NO`U+FAG)

Where: ET = Epicness of the Thread

NO'U = Number Of [[User|Users]] also posting on the thread 

FAG = How much the post is a [[Failed]] [[Attention Whore|Attention Grab]]

==[[Epic Thread]]==

A thread becomes [[epic]] when it gets attention for being [[crap|the crème de la crème]] of its class, or when its [[OP]] has done something [[lulzy]], probably involving a felony.  Examples of an epic thread include [[Ohbutyouwillpet]]'s [http://ohbutyouwillpet.livejournal.com last LiveJournal entry], [[rockonlittleone]]'s [http://members.shaw.ca/kouji/esmie/page7.htm last Xanga entry], and Freewebspace.net's example of [http://www.freewebspace.net/forums/showthread.php?t=27388 epic fail at being epic], thus contradictorily producing [[anti-lulz|reverse epicity]].  These threads are usually [[meme|memed]] to infinity by all manner of [[mudkip|mudkipping]] and [[IMMA_CHARGIN_MAH_LAZER|shoopery]], thus attracting users to the original thread for maximum gawkage and [[Internet detective]] [[roleplay]].

==Users==

[[User|Users]] notice that an epic thread is open for [[stop posting|moar posting]], and proceed to add their own [[wank|contribution]].  Common Internet sense dictates that, much like touching a [[fake|moonrock]] or inserting your penis in famous [[whores]], leaving your mark on an epic thread does nothing for your own [[uncyclopedia|inferior status]].  For some [[b/|users]], this does not matter, because posting in an epic thread that's been memed is itself [[not a meme|a meme]], a [[not a meme|meta-meme]], or [[mindfuck|not a meme]] and is its own reward.  For many, many others, this is the chance to shine and be [[tl;dr|counted]].

==The Post==

Early comments in an epic thread after the cause célèbre is [[Party V&]] typically include denunciations of their being a [[sick fuck]] and expressed desires for them to enjoy [[In_the_ass|new experiences]].  However, posts made with the sole intention of being part of an epic thread come later, and can either be hilarious or, more often, [[fail]].  Mitigating factors, even for posts of otherwise high concentrations of [[lulz]], include the time between the [[OP]]'s thread initiation and the post, the number of other [[fgts|contributing users]] in the thread, and the epicness of the thread itself.  A quick PIAET made in an epic thread involving a [[murderer]] or [[pedo]] with the right blend of [[lulz]]-[[drama]] and posted just before the [[deleting your livejournal|gates close]] and cut off [[your mom|your competition]], preferably with [[Lies|undisclosed inside information]] as a [[gimmick|gag]] inserted in, would be most optimal according to the formula.  But you'll probably just fag it up with scrolling text years after it happened.  And that's why you can pass it off as a [[meme]] today.
