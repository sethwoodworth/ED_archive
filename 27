'''/tg/''' is [[4chan]]'s board for traditional games. Mostly populated by neckbeards, its residents are often referred to as fa/tg/uys and ca/tg/irls, and sometimes variations thereof (like [[Warhammer|devou/tg/uardsmen]] or [[r9k|excellen/tg/entlemen]]). Though /tg/ is supposed to be for all sorts of traditional games, posting anything unrelated to those two will result into sagebombing. That is not entirely true. The board is worksafe, meaning that it is flooded with all sorts of [[porn]]. /tg/ has much in common with /[[a/]] and /[[v/]]; instead of talking about how they love games, the board is decicated to expressing their hate towards everything that can be tangentially linked to the board. Indeed, five minutes in /tg/ supplies 100% the daily-recommended allowance of [[rage]]. /tg/ has also spawned its own chan, [http://tgchan.org/ tgchan], which is nowadays mostly ignored and considered something akin to a bastard child.

== How to troll /tg/ ==
/tg/ is one of the easiest boards to troll. Known methods for trolling include:

* 4e > 3.5e
* nWoD > oWoD
* Say that C.S Goto is actually pretty good writer who respects the lore.
* Explain calmly why [[Weeaboo|Tau]] are superior to every other race in [[Warhammer 40,000]].
* "This thread is irrelevant. [[Sage]]."
* Warmachines > Warhammer
* [[Touhou]]
* Basically everything that has anything to do with the Ultramarines.
* [[Implying implications]]
* Request moar Cultist, /tg/'s board-tan and the target of merciless enforcing of [[Rule34]] in the form of [[Raping Little Suzy|rapefics]].

==Mods==
[[Image:Traditional_Games2.png|thumb|In /tg/, the mods are gods and the users are atheists.]]
/tg/ has no mods. That is the truth. Some mod who flips through the boards may delete a thread, but that's it. Sadly, the things were not always that way. In the [[2009|times of old]], the board was ruled by a large group of facist dickwads called moderators that deleted all the awsome threads and ban EVERYTHING and EVERYONE. Not unlike the 40k universe, dark times for /tg/ indeed. 

People were running to and fro, screaming as if the sky had fallen and as if all life had slipped from the natural pattern! ''“The Janitor!”'' They cried, ''“The Janitor has come and savaged our thoughts! He has taken our children! There is no hope but to despair!”''

It was unprecedented and unexpected, and indeed it was just as they cried. From gathering to gathering, others tried desperately to piece together thoughts only to watch them melt away into nonexistence. Overhead loomed only a swirling and indefinite morass, and what this creature truly was swiftly became a matter of rampant conjecture. Soon men leapt to arms and screamed to the sky, ''“Down with the Janitor! We must stop him before all his lost! We must destroy him and secure our livelihood!”''

But valiant as these cries may have been, they were merely words lost in a din of confusion. Unerringly and without reprieve, Dwarf Fortresses toppled to the ground inexplicably or suffered from irreparable cave-ins. It was as if adamantium had been struck, and a legion of unholy elephants had trampled everything in a straight line across the world. Brainstorming circles which did not explicitly mention roleplaying manuals during their converse went up in flames and evaporated, leaving their participants stunned and confused.

Soon nothing was being created. All that remained was screaming and panic and all pointed their weapons furiously to the sky to call for action. But what action could they take? They were mere mortals before a force we did not understand! They had no tools with which to defend ourselves! Except, of course, their overwhelming stupidity.

'' “Derp!"'' they all cried in unison!

One man began conjuring images of anthropomorphic beasts lying with one another. Others joined in, testing the limits of how far the maelstrom would tolerate such a thing. Many continued screaming, ''“Derp! Derp! Derp!”'' in a rhythmic chant, hoping that it may perhaps drive the Janitor away to other lands. A few others attempted continue on as if nothing had happened, requesting that they help them min/max their mindless paladins or clerics.

Then, finally, without our even noticing, the great storm, “the Janitor”, receded. Pictures of beasts in the throes of passion went unmolested, and though countless people continued to scream nonsense at each other, no more ideas vanished before their due. Gradually, and with much griping, things began to resume as normal. The scars remained, of course, as many insisted that this return to the casual would not last, but for now Dwarf Fortresses sprang up in greater number than before while other threads carried on expressing as many of their previously repressed views as possible.

Those who had come in late, or perhaps those who had seen the chaos but did not want to believe it would reoccur, began to speculate that there never was a “Janitor”. They claimed it was merely sorcery; a trick to deceive us, for a laugh at their expense. They had no reason to fear, and as long as we did not grow excited we would all be fine. After all, there had never been reason previously to do away with Dwarves and Touhous, so why now?

Others reflected that it was a time of judgment. At last, a being had come to purge the awful Sodom and Gomorrah that was their filthy land. This had been a long time coming, more was sure to be seen, and above all else it was justified. “The Janitor” was their time of reckoning, and soon we would know who was worthy of survival in the upcoming strife. All beware. All prepare. There will be no forgiveness, no love, no understanding. Only damnation.

[[Some Argue|Some oldfags speculate]] that the mods were actually newfags who wrote 500 words of convincing bullshit. [[It is a mystery]] what caused the mods and the feared Janitor to disappear. Maybe it was moot's mighty [[banhammer]] or [[Goatse|something else]]...

==Namefags==
* [[Azn|Chink]], a legendary [[guro]] doujin artist who faked his own death.

* Jim Profit, exceptionally bad troll who ultimately got banned by [[moot|Mootykins]] himself. [[Butthurt|Unable]] to [[deal with it]], he  tried to [[Writing Yourself Into An Article|write several of articles about himself]] in [[User:Jim_Profit|ED]].

* Scriptarius, [[Finland|finfag]] who lives in the gray sea of miniatures. Proud ex-owner of a curly hair about which songs were written and the minstrels were sung of in the ages immemorial. His pics can be recognized from the painting of [[Hitler]] on the wall.
