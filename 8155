The Carr-Benkler Wager
{{crapstub}}
<br>
'''The Carr-Benkler Wager''' is a wager between Wikipedia's best troll Nicholas Carr and Yochai Benkler about the pricing of collective production of content on Web sites. The wager runs from 2006-07-19 until approximately 2011-07-19. Carr argues that collective content production will be priced. The Carr-Benkler wager is the epitome of the e-war between the pro-"[[Web 2.0]]" and the anti-"Web 2.0" (aka "'Web 2.0' sucks") people.

==Wikipedia implications==
On [[TOW]], the first sign of marketization of content production is its [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Bounty board|bounty board]], where people are allowed to exchange money and Wikipedia edits. The next step is every Wikipedia troll's and "vandal"'s dream: Wikipedia with contextual advertising and less [[bureaucratic fuck]]ing, or dissolution of Wikimedia.
