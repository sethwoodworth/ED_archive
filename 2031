[[Danny]] lives with his gay lover [[Ryulong]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] -- they used to live together in New York. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Danny Danny] is an ex-administrator on [[TOW]] and one heckuva guy, just like [[Essjay]]. After slaving away for years, pushing pencils, shining Jimbo's wiener, and denying Daniel Brandt [[VFD|satisfaction]], he recently decided he'd had enough and resigned all his [[Bureaucratic Fuck|steward access, checkuser, bureaucrat, administrator, etc.]] on Wikimedia, and Wikipedia.

Then, while snorting a few lines between breakfast and brunch, he got nominated for administratorship ''[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Danny|once again]]'', after leaving his position with the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] ''just days ago under shady, unknown circumstances'', by Wikipedia's resident [[fatty]], [[Cyde]]. The nom was accepted, and thinking it'd be a cakewalk, Danny took the steps to [[Coprophilia#.22Why_yes.2C_it_is_in_fact_a_fetish.21.22|shit on exactly every single opposer]] (at this stage, around [[At least 100|50]]), dismissing all the op[[poser]]s as "fatty fat fat fat [[Luser|lusaz]]" and ". When you've got the whole cabal behind you, one has nothing to fear.

Despite reaching WP:100 faster than a nigger on the hunt for a bucket of KFC, rather stubborn and infinitely better opposition arguments were presented:

{{quote|'Oppose''' [[Cyde|per nom]].|Bunchofgrapes|On Danny's RfA}}

Yet, despite the absence of motherfuckin' [[Shit nobody cares about|consensus]], Danny was promoted by Raul654 and his basement dwelling cronies - not really a surprise, but ''MOTHERFUCKING SURPRISE!'' Hilarity ensued[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Danny#Totally_unacceptable][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Danny#Dan.27s_conduct] as the many butthurt wikipedos bitched and whined about how the bureaucratic fucks totally disregarded all opposing arguments and passed the RfA. A [[TL;DR|reform of the administrator promotion process was even suggested]], lolz! But in the end, the only person who cared was [[Grace Note]].

== Veropedia ==
On October 2007, Danny announced Wales' new slimy tentacle in the expansion of [[Wikimedia Foundation]]: [[Veropedia]]. This project, like Wikipedia, is for-profit, but the site at least says it publicly. Wool will act as a puppet.

Veropedia is supported by [[advertising]]. In the words of some blogger, ''"It’s an interesting way to try to monetize all of the information contributed by Wikipedia’s [[virgins|huge group of volunteers]]... And I’d be surprised if anyone who thinks that Wikipedia is not reliable enough is likely to put any more faith in the editors of Veropedia."''

==Jimbo’s Piggy Bank==
In March 2008, Danny revealed what everyone else had known for a long time; that [[Jimbo]] was using public donated funds to finance his lifestyle [http://allswool.blogspot.com/2008/03/money-for-nothing-chicks-for-free.html]. However like a vengeful ex who shouts about all the illegal stuff they did while they were together, Danny doesn’t seem to realise that he has dropped himself into the shit by publicly acknowledging that he knew about these “financial irregularities” at the time.
