Frank the Goat

Frank the [[goatse|Goat]] is [[LiveJournal]]'s trusty mascot.  He greets LiveJournal users on the front page of [[LJ]], either by chewing on something, holding a sign, celebrating a holiday, or [[piss]]ing all over the furniture.  

==A History==

[[Image:frank34.jpg|thumb|Rule 34]] 

[[Franks|Frank]] was born to Francine the Goat and Franz in [[France]] sometime in the 1990s.  After Francine died, Franz left Frank in a ditch and went missing.  Miraculously, Frank survived, and was picked up by a band of roving [[gypsies]].  This is where it all went downhill.

The gypsies did all sorts of horrible things, from putting oatmeal [[in the ass]] of the goat to forcing him to partake in [[homosexual]] acts involving [[mediacrat]] and [[pirat ponton]].  Frank began taking [[drug]]s, and, before long, was thrown onto the streets of [[The Netherlands|Amsterdam]] and forced to turn tricks for tin cans and cabbage.

Luckily for him, [[Brad Fitzpatrick]] was visiting Europe around that time.  After eating a batch of [[marijuana]] brownies, he had the munchies and thought "hey, this goat would make a great meal."  Frank, however, would have none of that, and somehow convinced Brad to take him back to [[Seattle]] with him.  It is unknown what took place, but it probably had something to do with [[Quasidan's penis]].

Today, Frank lives happily in a pen at [[Six Apart]] headquarters.  He's allegedly [[rich and beautiful]] for a goat.
