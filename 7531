Singularitarianism
Singularitarianism is the [[Rapture]] for [[nerd|nerds]]. Invented by Vernor Vinge and stolen by His Extropic Divinity Raymondo Kurzweil III, this [[fantasy|moral philosophy]] is based upon the [[lie|belief]] that a [[mechanophilia|technological singularity]] — the [[software|technological]] creation of smarter-than-human intelligence — is possible, and advocating deliberate action to bring it into effect and ensure its safety. Many futurists and [[furry|transhumanists]] speculate on the possibility and nature of this type of singularity, often referred to as just the Singularity; capitalized and objectivized to indicate its [[important|sheer magnitude as a historical event]]. [[nerd|Singularitarians]] believe it is not only possible, but desirable if and only if guided safely. Accordingly, they "dedicate their lives" to acting in ways they believe will contribute to its [[win|safe arrival]] - in practice this means they take 170+ dietary supplements daily and will die from Sunset Yellow intoxication before [[Singularitarianism|Kingdom Come]]. 

==Beliefs==
[[Image:TheSingularity.jpg|right|thumb|Trust them!]]
* Singularitarians wrongly assume that [[Futuristic Sex Robotz|machines]] will like them.
* Singularitarians correctly assume that [[IRL]] people do not like them and think they're [[nerd]]s.
* Singularitarians believe the Singularity [[lie|will benefit the entire world]], but not benefit any specific individual or group, as long as they get to [[sysop|say who and how]].  See: [[wikipedia|Broken Leviathan]].
* Dietary supplements must replace regular diet, exponentially. 
* Space Odyssey is a documentary.
* Sarah Connor will be taken care of as soon as construction of 'The [[last thursday|WayBack]] Machine' is completed.

==Who or What the Fuck is a Singularitarian==

*[[Piotrus]] is often seen giving [[suck|mouth-to-mouth]] to [[wikipedia]].
