[[Image:Ljpizzaparty.jpg|thumb|One of the community's icons.]]

{{ljcomm|ljpizza_party}} was a [[LiveJournal]] community dedicated to using [[sock puppet]] accounts to [[troll]] people's journals with pizza-related [[comments]].  Such comment blitzes are referred to by the community members as "pizza parties".

LJpizza_party was eventually suspended for "organized harassment" but it may rise again in time.

==Typical LJPizza_Party Tactics==

# The community is joined with a variety of journals with different toppings...er...pizza-related names.
# A user decides to have a "pizza party" at another user's journal.
# [[Lulz]] ensue as all the pizza puppets use pizza-related comments, [[image]]s, and [[image macro]]s to spam the shit out of the journal.
