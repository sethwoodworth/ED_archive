Raproll
Raproll is the unofficial name for a movement to flood P2P networks with renamed versions of Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" disguised as rap songs that began [[last Thursday]]. This will effectively [[rickroll]] a shitload of niggers. The goal of the project was to spread the files onto many different P2P networks like Kazaa, Limewire, and Gnutella. The potential need for mass participation caused the OP to reach out to 4chan for help.

If you want to take a part of the Raproll, all you have to do is put some of the currently used files into your filesharing program. And remember to only roll the shitty P2P networks like Kazaa, Limewire and the likes. Nigras can't torrent!

YouTube can also be raprolled.

== How to do shot I raprolls? ==

To successfully raproll nigras, we must remember how P2P networking works. All anons must be using the same files in order to bump them up on the popularity scale. The more of the same we share, the more it will be downloaded by black person. Use the [[rapidshit]]s above.

Once rapidshits are downloaded, using a P2P program such as [[Limewire]] or Kazaa (since niggers cant torrent), make sure that the raprolled files are all ready to be shared via P2P to niggers. Also, you can make your own raproll by using the Raproller down there, but it is recommended that all anon use the same files. 

If you must make your own, either link rapidshit links here, create album torrents which wiggas (although not nigras) will try to download, or Google traps.

For great justice anon.

{{quote|anon, I have a request.

Join my in the attempted murder of Rap. Allow me to explain.

I'm going to attempt to copy many versions of Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" and change their names and details into the details you'd find on a shitty rap song. Then I'm going to put said files onto Limewire/Ares/Kazaa/etc.

Essentially I'm gonna rickroll a shitload of niggers.

I need /b/'s help however, just copy my example and help this spread.

WE ARE ANONYMOUS, WE ARE LEGION!|[[OP]]}}

A few minutes later, he [[bump]]ed it, as no one really gave a [[shit]]. A few sages and replies later, all of /b/ was on the bread. [[Newfags]] [[saged]] it, got flamed and then [[BAWWW|BAWWWED]] out. Etc, etc, raproll begins. 

Also, OP likes black person [[cocks]]. [[lie|He said it.]]

==Black_Magic==

This program works like so:

Put the .mp3 file you want to convert to a rickrolled one into the "raprolls" folder. 
Open up black_magic.exe and click "MP3 file" to navigate to the file.
Type in the new name of the file. Letters only please. You can always rename it after.
Then click the wild button that appears.  

Now navigate back to the raproll folder and you should see a file with the filename you picked. 
That is the new rickrolled file. 
In the middle of the file is 1 minute of rickroll.

No password. 

Now with added expansion pack of different *rolls http://rapidshare.com/files/103252923/Songs.rar.html

==The Rickster==
Another /b/tard has written a program that is being called the Rickster. You feed it a list of song names and it spits out a crapload of MP3 rickrolls with those filenames. Easy way to create rickrolls for above-listed rapidshits, and any other MP3 rickrolls. The niggers will never expect it. They fear technology.

Rickster 3.0 up for grabs. Why don't you have some delicious link?
