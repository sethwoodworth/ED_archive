'''Thread occupation''' is a [[flamer]]/[[troll]] trick which consists of occupying the majority of a forum's threads with [[inane flame|inane]] [[spam]]. When users find out that the previous discussion has been buried in empty posts (+1 posts are the best for this purpose), a generally disruptive [[flame war]] arises, allowing many [[lulz]].
