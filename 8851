The '''Power Wrist''', an armor accessory in ''Secret of Mana'' for the [[SNES]], was possibly the first meme born out of the womb of [[/b/]] after the tragic events of [[B/-day|August 25, 2006]]. Naturally, much debate erupted from the Internet's newly-installed [[7chan|twin assholes]] like [[tubgirl|explosive diarrhea]] as to [[shit nobody cares about|where exactly]] the meme originated, but after some [[lolicon]] was posted [[Anonymous]] settled down.

==The Nativity [[Controversy]]==
Appearing at the time it did, many 4chaners violently resisted '''Power Wrist''', making such vitriolic statements as "[[gbt]][[7chan]] w/ur shitty meme" to posters of related macros. However, a later thread displayed screenshots which included the timestamps of the original posts, thereby debunking the theory that 7chan had created the meme, causing some to post "gb/2 4chan w/ur shitty meme."

==The Meme of the Opera (good pun, stfu)==
The original post, accompanied by the image above, was as follows:
; : So I'm playing Secret of Mana with my friend Senate over ZSNES. We just got to The Empire (more than halfway through the game), and he's still wearing his fucking power wrist. It has 4 defense, as opposed to the ~20 defense from the armor available to us right now (this makes a lot of difference in the world of mana), but he keeps it anyways because it has +5 STR which he is convinced is more important than any amount of defense (it's not).
; : So while we were in the shop at The Empire, he gave up control of his character for a moment to go AFK, so I popped into his inventory and unequipped his power wrist so I could sell it and buy a Golem Ring instead. He noticed soon after he returned that his power wrist was missing, and became irate.
; : So now we're on our way to "potatos" (he means Potos Village) to buy back his power wrist. What he doesn't know is that he can buy it at the shop we just left in The Empire.
