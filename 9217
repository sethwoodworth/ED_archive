[[Image:PunkPrincess2.jpg|thumb|200px|A true [[Crackwhore|Punk Princess]]. Note the pink scooter.]]
'''XxPrincessPunkxX''', ([[Powerword]]: Jennifer [[Portugal|Da Costa]]) commonly known as "Emo Chin of Toronto", is a [[Unwarranted self-importance|self-proclaimed spokesperson]] for the "Emo Movement" who has [[dead friend|dead friends]]. Although her name is XxPrincessPunkxx she doesn't listen to punk music at all and is obviously very scene and [[16-year-old girl|listens to Fall Out Boy as she drives her Volkswagen Beetle]]. She is very clearly an emo fag poser, and in no way should she be taken seriously. PrincessPunk (or '''Emo Chin''') is a [[loli]], [[emo]], [[camwhore]] and the subject of countless lulz, resulting from her response to [[Fox News]]' [(Video has been taken down)] of the emo culture. Her "response" video attacked punkers and other emofag haters, claiming she would [[internet tough guy|box the shit out of them]]. <strike> Of course, this is all a lie, and she is really one of the most amazing and caring people to walk the earth.</strike> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|HAHAHA, DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS.]]

==The Drama Begins==
[[Image:PunkPrincess4.jpg|thumb|XxPrincessPunkxx spent hours carefully posing for this [http://hs.facebook.com/profile.php?id=503320777 Facebook profile] pic.]]
[[Image:IRONASReaction.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[BAWWWWW|Video Summary]]]]
Like any good [[lolcow]], she included a drama-ridden and completely incoherent rant about how she stood at the forefront of a "movement" of emo kids, who are just like [[Niggers|oppressed minorities]]. Sadly, she did not compare any of those oppressing her movement to [[superman|Hitler]] or his [[Nazi|Nazis]], which would have, and should have been the crux of her [[epic]] rant. However, [[Godwin's Law]] tells us that the probability of this is approaching one as you read this.

The video was originally linked into the [[b/|/b/]] message board at 4chan. Within two hours, the comments on the video had exceeded the views by a 3:1 ratio. As the morning wore on, several video responses were posted.  One of which was by [[YouTube]]r Neokun127, who was verbally attacking Emo Chin. Neokun127 would eventually go on to defend Emo Chin.

* Q. What do you tell an emo girl with two black eyes (presumably after "turning her fucking head like Jesus")
* A. Nothing you haven't already told her twice!

==Response from /b/==
As the story goes, Emo Chin joined a Blindmute [[Loli]] [[AIM]] chat to whore her video and [[great justice|wrath]] was administered by the heavy hand of [[Anon]].

She never entered Blindmute Loli, as she doesn't have an AIM account. Her video was randomly linked into 4chan's /b/ by a dark twist of fate, and hilarity ensued. Eventually, Emo Chin's personal data was leaked onto the intarbutts, and she began to receive countless prank phone calls and emails.


Emo Chin was on [[Threatening suicide|Suicide Watch]] and had threatened to overdose on medications including heart medication. She had been hyperventilating over the phone. Eventually, Neokun127 recorded a video where Emo Chin spoke through his speaker phone and posted it on YouTube. This was the turning point, and Neokun127 became a target of /b/'s wrath along with Emo Chin for the rest of the evening.

== Goodnight Sweet Princess ==

As of 7/17/07 XxPrincessPunkxx has [[Deleting_your_Youtube_Videos|deleted ALL of her YouTube videos]].  Her "[[An hero|goodbye]]" video says it all.

"I'm done... I'm finished... but you know what... I'm not... I'm not done, well I'm DONE but I'm not done yet - y'know?"

What does this mean for 4Chan??  '''[[Win]]!'''

What kind of win, you say???  Oh, I dunno, maybe "Whatever this shit is about Mudkip, Ok, and, Raining chocolate?  Whatever."

"Real soon's my birthday, and I'll be 'sweet sixteen'! More like SOUR sixteen, all those pictures all over the internet..."



And the accompanying video description (Spelling preserved for posterity):
     
     This is to all the 4chan.org ppl i'm not gonna cuss

==Present Activity==
[[Last Thursday]] a [[Facebook]] group created by her was discovered in which she called her [[Gaia|peers]] to unite against Anonymous. She also claims that Anon had something to do with [[an hero|Mitchell Henderson's]] demise. It was consecutively spammed by Anon and soon to be abandoned by her, enabling Anonymous to take over. [http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2418499493 View it here]. UPDATE: The group has now been taken over by an [[emo]] [[moralfag]] who wants to bring it back the fight and some other [[tl;dr]] stuff.

She recently made a new Youtube account, [http://www.youtube.com/user/xHaiiJinxtx] which just goes to show her [[attention whore|dedication]] for emokind.

[[Protip]]: trolling this particular emo is bound to bring some extra butthurt as their is likely some [[lesbian]] [[white knighting]] going on here.

Her <s>[http://s96.photobucket.com/albums/1168/xEmo_Jennx Photobucket account</s> BALEETED] has also seen lulzy uploads of screencaps labeled "traiter" which depict [[retards|newfags]] breaking [[Rules Of The Internet|rules 1 & 2]]. While breaking said rules is [[serious business]], her predictable motive of using them to create pointless drama and atrocious spelling make for a good laugh.

==Her Emofag friends' rantings==

"[[Fact|4chan is full of stupid pedophiles]] who have nothing fucking better to do than focus a [[ALL CAPS|WHOLE FUCKING SITES MEMBER BASE ON ATTACKING AN INNOCENT GIRL WHO VOICED HER OPINION.]] gimme a fucking break. What satisfaction does one get attacking someone over the internets and running back to their site to type "omg Epic epic! Win win!" Wow you PHISHED her MySpace account. The easiest shit in the world to do, which isn't even considered [[CS3|hacking.]] She probably used the same pw for every account shes made under her email...probably had some sort of sensitive material in her email that you got her cell phone/address from. You want a cookie for all of it? Pathetic. 
But I'm sure you've learned to embrace and celebrate your stupidity 4chan, or btards, or whatever you chose to label yourselves." 

@Jennifer 
"...are you really going to let these sorry excuses stop you from voicing your beliefs and run your life?" 
'''shroominc07@yahoo.com''' 
[[Asking for it|"Go ahead, id like to see a 4chan lowlife even try and play with me]]."

Conclusion: All emos and [[an hero]]s have friends who can't spell.
Go troll.

==Responses==

Our own [[User:Rena_Maniacle|Rena_Maniacle]] had this to say on the matter.

{{cs2|retort|The Epic Message (Click to open)|"Listen [[bitch]], you're [[fuck|fucking]] stupid. Maybe you don't watch TV up there in [[Canada|maple syrup land]], but there's these [[Cock|things]] called trends. See, the 80's brought [[Wigger|wiggers]] and [[Goth|goths]], the 90's brought poseur [[Punk|punks]] and grunge, and the 00's brought [[emo]] and [[Retard|scene-fags]]. You guys are going to be completely [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|forgotten]] in about three years when the next [[Furry|trend]] takes over; whatever is underground now most likely. <br><br>
I'll admit, I listen to hardcore music. But I'm definitely not some retarded-ass emo bitch. Emo music fucking sucks, period. You know why everyone in an emo band is [[16_year_old_girl|goddamn 19 years old]]? Because all you do is [[Music|play bar chords and majors, the bass player follows the guitar and the lead singer screams and then cries]]. It takes no fucking talent and everyone but the emo [[Pussy|pussy's]] can see it. You show me one emo kid than could even attempt to do me any damage and [[Internet_tough_guy|I would refer you to my fucking knife]]. Emo is the exact same phenomenon as how [[metal]] evolved-a bunch of [[Fag|faggots]] got picked on in [[school]] and then grew up to [[W|hate the world]]. <br><br>
There's a difference though: Metal kicks ass, emo is fucking [[gay]]. Instead of looking bad-ass and getting bigger and making music that a good majority of people listen to occasionally, your sub-culture made a point of how [[Tranny|small]] and weak they were, they were proud to look like pussies and the world has to deal with their [[shit|shitty-ass]] music that only they and anyone under the age of [[13_year_old_boy|thirteen]] likes. So your friends passed away by committing [[Emo|suicide]]? That doesn't sound like passing away.... it sounds like [[An_hero|fucking killing yourself like a little emo bitch]]. What happened? Their boyfriend broke up with them? They got beat for being a dumbass emo kid? Oh snap, did their parents backhand them in the fucking mouth for being a dumb [[cunt]] one too many times? I can tell just from the background of your fucking [[YouTube|video]] that you have no goddamn problems in your fucking life at all. That's why everyone hates emo kids you stupid [[slut]], [[Truth|because they bitch about how hard life is when there's nothing really that fucked up for them]]. Everyone knows life is tough, that's how the world fucking works; emo kids think they've stumbled on to something special and they haven't. <br><br>
Scene kids are the fucking worst though, [[Oxymoron|happy emo's]]. And the whole dinosaurs and robots? Grow the fuck up before I rip that goddamn ring out of your lip. There's another thing. For starters, your a fucking girl. If I punched you in the fucking mouth you'd go down (especially considering you already have a hideously deformed chin) so what're you gonna do? Box me? OH SHIT! I'd rip the fucking ring out of your mouth in kick you in your dumbass twat, what would you do then bitch? Absolutely nothing, have your goddamn emo friends bitch about me on [[MySpace]]. <br><br>
You know why a "black person" and an emo kid will never get along? Because "black person" have real problems, like you know, black person? And emo kids have nothing wrong at all, except mommy and daddy won't give them a [[Azn|new car for their birthday]]. Unless your talking about the [[Idiot|dumbass]] black person who pretend to be gangster and from the streets [[Lie|while pulling a 4.0 GPA]] in which case your just fucking stupid. As for being "black person" I would suggest actually conversing with a black person instead of watching the video's on [[MTV]] between [[KILL_IT_WITH_FIRE|Fall Out Boy]] and [[Gay|Taking Back Sunday]]. <br><br>
Now let's work on you. You're fucking hideous, what the hell happened to your chin? Did you claim to be "black person" and get [[Shotgun Mouthwash|shot in the mouth?]] And then there's your fucking MySpace pic. [[White_Trash|You do realize your hair is nasty fucking swamp-ass green right]]? It's fucking disgusting you dirty skank. [[My_Chemical_Romance|You have more eyeliner then a raccoon]] and you have a SEVERE lack of [[Boobs|breasts]]. And [[Bullshit|your not a full emo because you aren't sad all the time]]? Being sad all the time isn't what an being an emo is about, it's about keeping your perfect image together so your little faggot friends won't disown you for not being a fucking faggot. Now at this point let me make a quick distinction. [[Lie|I have no problem with gay people, nor do I have a problem with black people. What I do hate is faggots and niggers]], I'm sure you can figure out what that means. <br><br>
Anyway, back to [[you]]. Why not just take a normal goddamn picture and [[Camwhore|show everyone what you actually look like]]? It isn't clever to look like a moron who can't work a fucking camera. I don't know how this trend started but it has to fucking stop. And if your so "down" with everyone why don't you have one of them take the picture? You're just a pathetic little [[white]] girl who hasn't found [[Cock|what she wants out of life yet]]. The only thing you ever watch is MTV because it plays your emo-bullshit and you picked up some [[Wigger|fake-street talk]] along the way. [[Unrealistic_Expectations|Eventually you'll grow the fuck up]] and realize you aren't going to change shit; it's just a fashion trend and if you don't leave it behind then you're never going to get a job, so good going. [[Divide_by_zero|The only regret I have is that I won't be there to see your face when you realize one day that yes, you have to grow up, and yes, what you did as a kid was fucking dumb]]. What are you changing exactly? The punks were against corporations -- [[Lol|they sold]] out. The hippies were all about peace and love -- [[Liberal|their generation is still keeping our troops in Iraq]]. What exactly are you guys against? Having your heart broken? Well it's gonna fucking happen. <br><br>
Now please tell me exactly; how does screaming "SHE RIPPED MY HEART FROM MY CHEEEEEEST" Show that one is sick of society and wants something to change? Those lyrics were written by fucking [[teenagers]], take them at [[Cum|face value]], it's all they mean. If you feel so strongly about this movement of yours then write me back, I won't result to simply [[Flamewar|flaming]] you, I [[Lie|honestly want to see what you have to say to defend yourself]]. Until I get a message back you from you you're just another dumb cunt."''|0}}

As you can see she was clearly [[Pwn|pwnt]], if you bothered to read all that shit. Conclusion? Epic [[Win]] for [[EDiot|EDiots]].

==Became An Hero?==
[[Image:Bangbus.jpg|thumb|You can always rely on the bros for [[Anal|a ride]].]]
Sometime [[last Thursday]], Emochin showed up on a Global News segment about the transit strike in [[Toronto]], [[Canada|Canada]], bitching about how she has no way home. The segment aired April 26, 2008.

[[Image:YouTube demands an hero.png]]
Even [[YouTube]] demands that she turns into [[an hero]] via suicide

==She's back!==
XxPrincessPunkxX has been seen back on [[YouTube]] once again looking less emo and more annoying with the YouTube username xHaiiJinxtx.

== [[BAW|Hello Again, It's me Jenn!]] ==


{{squote|Bonjure My darlings, Nothing new about me really? 
Tis a shame, any ways i know you guys always say "we do not forgive, we do not forget" something or other-
But i just wanted to send a friendly hello there! ^_^

Typically of coarse i'm not the same "cam whore", "cum dumpster", "emo chin" You all remember and Loved to hate.
I seem to have grown up and learned to spell, however i will admit my grammar could use some touch ups here and there
But i guess what i wanted to say was I'm sorry, That i… Hmmm, Offended? but i'm sure thats not the case, i mean-
you all were making fun of me and threatening me for the "Lulz". Telling me to "go die" or commit suicide was your atrocious 
way of getting more continuous Lulz. i mean thinking that you actually have the power to make someone commit such an act,
its horrendous really, and as much as i know you all deserve to be ashamed, I don't care enough to say it to you.
But what i will say is Thank You, If it were not for all you "trolls" B-tards and So on, I wouldn't be as amazing as i am now,
I mean  the girl who plays Call of Duty, and Halo and wins, The girl who makes Amazing meals in the kitchen, 
not to mention the girl who walks into her boyfriends bedroom with nothing but an apron and some heels on. 
I'm ruthless and Sexy so i've been told and i've become quite an intellectual little miss if i might add.
And its all Thanks to you Guys <3 
So, leave mean msgs if you want, post photoshopped pictures and whatever suits you're fancy on the internet
But that girl you attacked over the internet died along with every weak and cowardice aspiration I had.

Any whoo Dinner's getting cold and my boyfriend has to leave soon, so with that I bid you all a'due 
p.s don't be stranger message me, try to get to know me, I promise i won't bite unless bitten first.

xoxo

Jenn
