Well, Robert, or may I call you Bob (which happens to be my father's name as well, but he likes to be called Bob)?   If I may quote my new blog on my MySpace page, which was also a reply to a black male who e-mailed me inquiring if I was prejudiced.



"It is also proven that Majority of the Male Population are arrogant,
ignorant of others' feelings and emotions, rarely give full thought to
their actions before executing them, testosterone driven, more for
danger than Peace.  A lot of women will likely have the same feelings
against the Males they encounter.  Yet among all the women, they find
the FEW among the males who are the opposite of the traits I have just
listed, and they accept them for not only their potential husbands, but
their True Emotional supporters and providers."



So, from the considerably sterotypical qualities of majority of the male population, yet well-proven facts, they ARE just jerks, looking for cheap laughs at others' expense.  ED is losing their power, and so is a great chunk of cheap laughs at peoples' expenses.  I feel that if someone wants a cheap laugh at others expenses, just turn on the TV, and leave those laughs there; don't take them with you in public.



Also, let20me ask you, considering the 50/50 chance of you having watched "Family Guy" or not.  How do you feel about Megan Marie Griffin?  Honestly, in my humble opinion, I meant what I said about Megan Marie Griffin.  She is NOT ugly; she has always been a beautiful catch in my eyes.  I just do not understand how anyone would see Megan as ugly, and I feel it is very pitiful that Seth McFarline would make her the "punching bag" of most everyone else on the show, when clearly she does not deserve such torturous punishment.  I am in the same boat as she is, if you think about it; I'm the punching bag of the jerks on ED who are getting their heinous "LULZ" (a rehash of LOL, meaning "Laugh Out Loud"), but in my opinion, LULZ means "Laughs Under Lucricities," which is obviously not good.



Two more things I will let you know about, in the comment I left in your video with the song, when I thanked you, I honestly meant that in a good way.  I hoped after reading that comment, it made your day.  And after watching that video, I am considering dedicating two or three pages in the comic I've resumed work on to me interviewing you, based on your video(s).  Keep that under your hat; the Ghostbuster/Family Guy parody I've provided was enough of a foretaste.



Also, I don't know where Christiansburg is, but it sounds like it's way more than 25 miles from Rucker
sville and Charlottesville, so thank you for your offer there.  And while I would have nothing to do beyond having to tolerate most of the male population, you have earned yourself a respectable spot in my margin-of-error for acquaintances, the President, celebrities and my father and other relatives.  It was good to make your acquaintance, Bob.



Peace;

Christian Weston Chandler.



PS

You do not need to be so formal, just "Chris" will suffice.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
I've only had a few things to keep me sane, my video games (mostly Guitar Hero), my family, going to church, and the ocassional outtings with my family.  Seriously, I really miss my fridays at the Pokemon League.



BTW, Ty, did you get your Playstation 3 yet?  If you have, please send me a Friend Request through the PSN; my PSN ID is "Sonichu".  How are you on Guitar Hero III's "Raining Blood", and the other songs in that final set?  I tell you what, "Raining Blood" is so darn difficult on any difficulty.  My Hammer-Ons/Pull-Offs are good, but it is really difficult for me when the notes are so close together in a tight H-O/P-O stream.



But I digress, please send my regards to everyone at the League, especially Megan and John.



Peace;

Christian Chandler.



P.S.



I've sent an apology letter to Michael at the Game Place; I hope that he will have an open heart, accept the apology and allow me back into The Place.  Otherwise, if his heart was so dang sealed shut, he would really be showing himself off as the biggest Jerk and potential B-tard.

Subject: Hey, Megan
<p>&nbsp;</p>
You know about as much as I know that I have taken responsibility for my error, and it has also been bringing me the darkest pain this month.

I want to patch up our friendship, because I do not want any further discomfort between you and me.  Although the acursed page is there now, if we just ignore it, it may fade away in a month or so.  Also, if we let every little dirty detail bother us, we're just as bad off as any pop or rock star.  They get abused a lot by the paparazi and the media for the details of their deeds that they could not have known about themselves at the time.  From the maximum amount of stress from all that; they sometimes get totally out of whack and possibly hurt themselves.  But you and I are only civilians without so much fame and fortune; you and I, we do not have to suffer such Star Stress; if we only put it behind us, we don't have to build such a stressful level within ourselves.

I myself had left it a good distance behind me for a few months, but then you were bothered by it.  And I couldn't help but dig up the remains left behind, only to build up a very stressfully torturing month for me.

Megan, I am sorry for uploading the drawing, and I really wish I could go back in time and stop myself from making the mistake.  Yet I do not regret drawing the drawing, because if I hadn't released my frustrations in the creative sense, I might actually have done something really dumb and stupid.  It was really stupid of me to let my impulsive anger get the best of me and make me upload it in an attempt to shove so much information down their throats and drown them into taking the page down.

But I've learned from my mistakes, and I regret letting my frustrations and anger get the best of me.  All I can do is put the whole thing behind me, try not to think about again, never look at the damn page, and move on with my life.


For the sake of our friendship, Megan, PLEASE just forget about the dang webpage, put it behind you, and let's resume our good friendship like the whole mess never happened.

I still love you, Megan, and I honestly care and worry about you from my heart.

Peace;
Chris Chan.

As I've said, the website means nothing to me. It's the fact that you blab about me on your blogs and therefore it gets put on the website. So in other words, ED didn't drag my name through the mud but you did.     I don't know, I can't keep disgracing myself and forgiving and forgiving. I have some pride you know. I've forgiven you so many times before it's just getting irritating now. Even I have my limits.      So I think I'd like to stay away from you at least for a while then as time passes I'll better know what to do.     Until then just please leave me alone

I've DELETED ALL of the ORIGINAL BLOGS months ago, just to let you know.  I can understand how you're feeling against me now, but it really hurts me and makes me sad that you don't want me close to you.

I'm just a lonly old-feeling fool who needs closure once in a while, and my mother and father won't be around forever.  I can remember the times we were close, we shared our honest feelings openly, my PSOne games on my PSP, and your Strawberry Pink character drawings...I really miss those tender moments.  And I got you all that stuff from eBay; the Sailor Moon cards, the DVDs, the figurines, the rest of that stuff, and recently the ZUNE, and you have repaid the pleasure of doing all that for you with greater interest.  I love to see you smile, I love to see you happy, and I love seeing the sweet, honest, tender and carefree kinda gal who is Megan Schroeder.

But now that I am barred from you for a big mistake I made that I have taken a great deal of responsibility, through trying to undo it, through taking down the previous pages leading up to it, through a month full of stress, tears, lonliness and too many moments standing by myself...

Remember some time ago, you jested that you wanted me to give up my heart to you?  Well, basically, I had already done that just after you and I met; my heart still cries for you; not a moment passes by when I don't have a tender, caring or worried thought about you.

Although I do understand your feelings, and I can only respect your wish of staying away from you...*sob**sob*...my heart still cries for you, I'll always be worrying about you, and I will always Love You, Megan Schroeder.  *sob*

I'll see you Sunday..., and I guess that's ALL I'll get to do with you...seeing you...from a long distance; as long as the most perilous journey, as long as a dream where I'm constantly running towards you; you'd look like you're near, yet you are soo far away from completing me...
I Love You, Megan Schroeder.

Peace;
Chris Chan.

I just want to be by myself for a while     And I haven't nor will I EVER forget all the wonderful surprises you have given me and such. Thank you.     This is only a "bye for now" just allow me to be alone and eventually things will cheer up ok?     Thanks and try to keep your chin up. And I'll try to do the same.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
I understand why you didn't want me to talk to you... *sigh*  I'd feel better if we can try not to think about that detail and put it behind us.

Megan, I really want to remain your friend, but I feel it growing more difficult with the emotional feeling of long distance between you and me.  I feel sad, lonely and rejected when you don't allow me to be socially close to you or even when you won't talk to me.  (Besides which, I get lonely everynight in the sanctity of my room, and even when I'm out with my mother, father, or alone, so I feel the extra loneliness and sadness like rubbing salt and vinager on a wound.)  Also, I can't help but feel the worry about how you are feeling everyday that I feel.  Please, Megan, put what has passed behind you and open yourself emotionally to me and let you and me be good friends like before.

Also, aside from my feelings, I wanted to let you know that I got an 8GB Memory Stick Duo; all my Full Downloaded Games and all my Save Data (for the UMD games as well) and all that from between the two 4GB sticks are now on the same Memory Stick.  What's more, I am able to give you one of my two for when you get your PSP, and copy your choice of PSOne classics and the game Beats, as well as a cornucopia of Sailor Moon MP3 tracks to play on Beats.  When ready, you may check out http://store.playstation.com to look up the variety of PSOne and PSN-Exclusive PSP titles that can be downloaded to the 4GB Memory Stick.

I think you still owe me a bit for the Zune; $20, Hamtaro toys and a DVD set.  If you are able to get all that to me next Friday, I would appreciate it, so you and I can be squared-away on that deal.

BTW, I won't be coming in Sundays for UFS; I've been going to the Wesley Foundation Methodist Church (after being kicked out of the Grace Baptist Church, and upon my father's suggestion) for over a month now.  And with that, I've also been attending the Sunday Night service for the young adult church members who are attending UVA.  Also, I've started hanging out in the Recreation Room in the upper floor of the next-door Student Centere Tuesday and Thursday Afternoons playing Guitar Hero on their PS2, or my PS3 which I bring there in a Toys 'R' Us Cloth Bag.  I've met a few new female acquaintances, but nothing has come up further than that yet.

One more thing, something good for you to look forward to, in addition to the German Dictionary I'm saving for your Birthday, I'm putting a special present together just for you to go with it.  It's not glittery or pricy, but it is a Special Surprise Present.  :)  And I'm not letting you in on what it is until the Friday closest to your Birthday.

Anyhoo, please allow me back into your world as your Good Friend, and I promise never to repeat the mistakes I've made.

I also wish John the best of luck and the Lord's blessing on him finding a new, better job.

Peace be with you;
Chris Chan.

Well first of all, I can't put this behind me because I don't feel comfortable around you anymore. Especially since you said you drew that so you wouldn't do anything stupid. What does that mean? Abducting me and raping me? I'm afraid I can't trust you anymore...     I'm sorry but I don't like being around men like that.     As for the zune, you said for me to hold on to the hamtaro and dvd's and I only recall having to pay you the 30$ for your credit card.     So I don't know what to say right now, but maybe you shouldn't give me anything for my birthday. I hate my birthdays and prefer not to be reminded of them

I would like to meet you somewhere and entrust the Dictionary to your capable hands for delivery to Megan.

Ok well look, I am unsure how I feel and what to do.      So here's what I think. I'd like for you to just completely leave me alone for a while, until I can sort things out myself, you understand? It's not like I hate you, but I don't see you in the same light anymore. So just leave me be for a while, let me try to recuperate with my few other friends. And maybe we can just start from scratch sometime. Maybe, I dunno, just depends on how I feel ok?     So please let me be, and let me see how it goes ok?

I understand.  You may or may not have had much exposure to sexual images as I've had, so the idea of a "hand job" (which was the act drawn there) as part of outtercourse (versus intercourse) was a surprise to you.  I'm sorry.  If it helps put things into perspective, I can reccomend finding information on the internet through this educational website I've found through AdamEve.com.  Or I reccomend renting "The 40 Year Old Virgin"; that movie touches on some of the issues around sex, and how it can really frustrate an older virgin who hasn't had the pleasure yet (or I can loan you my copy of "The 40 Year Old Virgin").  The point is allowing yourself more exposure to sex acts to make yourself feel more comfortable with that fact of life.

I worry about you, and I want to help you as much as I humanly can.  While I AM on the verge of taking that EncyclopediaDramatica page taken down, I understand that there are a number of other web pages of hate against me, and as much as I would like to be able to track every one down and report them and get on the verge of taking them down as well, someone else may put another hate page up against me.  It's a fact of this modern world known as "Cyber Bullying".

And as for the drawings, while I have shoved the text information down their throat in an attempt to drown them in submission; there were too many images of...penises...yech, on there.  I drew drawings promoting vaginas to go against those dickheads.  I did the drawing of Sonichu fucking Rosechu, I did the drawing of Bubbles getting it from Black Sonichu (I had the idea of paring them up in the comic book anyway), I did the drawings of Angelica and Mary Lee Walsh (that witch hag) mastubating.  And I did draw the drawing of me giving you a hand job, from among my adult fantasies, with your eyes censored to conceal your identity.  It was a massive step outside of my boundries, and I did it out of anger, and I regret having done it, and I am really, really, sorry.  But we all do things in the heat of anger, and/or out of our boundries, that we end up regretting later.

Megan, Sweetheart, I will give you as much space as you need during your time of recovery and learning how to cope with it and put it into your own perspective.  But please remember, I will always worry about you, and even though you may not feel the same about me as you did before, I still Care and Love You Very Much.  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

Take care; my thoughts and prayers are with you;
Chris Chan.

I have been investigating, in addition to out-of-spite "adding fire to the flame", since I've first found it randomly in that fateful day, November 2, 2007.  Please allow me to fill you in.  My first major clues of a matching duo were the original date of the document creation, Wednesday, Ocotber 31, 2007, and this .jpg, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan, which was obviously taken on the previous Friday, October 26, 2007.  For the week, my family and I were pondering the major suspect; the dude who took that pic, which I distinctly remember seeing the camera flash while I playing a young gentleman in Pokemon TCG.   Thus, my family came in and we found that Mimms had the camera in question, but he did not take the picture.  Then we've suspected Lucas, but we did not question him at the time.  But a more obvious expression reply was found by myself, when Saturday March 8, 2008, at the Gamestop in Forest Lakes, the Midnight release event of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Mimms and I were watching a pair of tournament players brawling; one was playing Donkey Kong.  So it brought up to mind my first word being "Monkey", so I told Mimms that.  And with a turn around towards the accompanying Lucas, I said in his direction, "Well, that's something new you didn't know about "be-4" about this "Chan".  I noticed a look on his face like, "Wow, I can totally wail on that tidbit of information."  He said nothing.  And today, I looked up 4Chan on Wikipedia.com, http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Chrischannov2007.jpg, apparently 4Chan is solely a web thing that people can go on and mess around for the attention, with examples of false bombings, hackers on MySpace, and more similar events listed on there.  Upon the collected information on this case I've let set on the back-burner for a while, I can only suspect Lucas for being the culpret in putting that page up in the first place, because, seeing how close Mimms and Lucas were, he had as much access to the beforementioned pic from October 26 as Mimms did.  Also, I photographically remember the person who took my pic that day being tall and wearing a long coat.  I'd like to put Lucas under a spotlight and question him about this whole thing, then put him behind bars for descreation of someone else's character.  I'd question him myself, but Mike of the Game Place said after my mother and father questioned Mimms that Friday night, if I were to bring up ANYTHING about that page again, he would kick me out of the Game Place for like a month.  If you'd like to talk to Lucas discreetly about the subject, I'd appreciate it for the benefit of my investiga
tion.
 
Megan, I am sorry about this whole mess, and having drawn that drawing, and raging the fire and hurting your feelings and emotions.  If I can, not only will I get that drawing off that webpage, but I'll try to take down the whole thing.  But I can't do it alone (my mother and father have been letting it set on the back-burner without giving it much thought).
 
I can only hope you'll forgive me, but no matter what, I still love you as my closest gal-pal.
 
I hope you feel better soon;
Chris Chan.

I didn't realize how much of an... a-hole I could have been; I was caught up in the rage from that weekend in November when I did that; I couldn't even see straight.  But I have done what I should have done long ago; inform AOL, as well as other places on the web who can take down offensive websites and pages.
 
I've really shot myself in the foot, and I am sorry.  Not only am I mad at myself for being such a complete enraged a-hole, but my rage against those jerks who put that page up in the first place arose with greater flame, because my closest friend got hurt emotionally (that's you).
 
I will see to that website's demise, or my name isn't Christian Weston Chandler.

And I am prepared to repeat that hundred times from the bottom of my hurting heart.

I just don't know what to say now....     I am very much scarred by that image and it will never leave me. And I can't decide what's worse, the image in general, or the fact you intentionally drew it AND gave it to the webmaster for that site that you hate so much. Not only have you poured gas on the fire by doing that,(adding obscenity to the already horrific site) but you have also embarrassed and humuliated me, and degraded and demeaned me whether you realize it or not. I mean I'm not that kind of girl, and you know that. So why? And you also lied to me about it.     Between that and my recent heartbreak how am I to trust another man again? Simply put: I can no longer trust anyone now.     You have very much hurt me on an emotional level. And when I get hurt emotionally it'll take a physical toll. As in no appetite, feeling tired and sick, no sleep.
So I am unsure what to do about this. I can't say I really think of you the same anymore, I'm sorry to say.   I will continue to give the remaining items for the zune and that will be all the contact you have with me unless I decide otherwise. I hope you understand. So we'll let time decide how I feel about this current situation. Until then please d
on't come up to me anymore unless it's to give you what I owe which seems kind of awkward now.     I know how it feels to be alone but, I can't keep throwing away my pride little by little just to keep you satisfied, you know what I mean? There has to be an "enough is enough" at some point. And I cannot continue to disgrace myself by forgiving things that I never find forgivable in the first place.     That's all I can think to say right now  I'm sorry, we'll just see  ~Megan

Hey thanks again SO VERY much for your thoughtful and kind and generous trade. Though I feel as though I took all your money since it mostly goes to your parents. :( But Thank You very much. I doubt I will be asking for much in the future, so just as an appreciation bonus I will go ahead and give you the Hamtaro toys along with the rest of the manga and stuff.     I'm sorry to hear about the Church thing, I mean God forgives and gives second chances. Some people just aren't meant to work under His name, like all the priests who abuse young boys.     Yeah that internet thing is getting very much out of hand and would like t
o ask if you could please take down or remove anything that has to do with me from any of your websites. I don't want to appear on those sites as well.     Thanks again!
~Megan
