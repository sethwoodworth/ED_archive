Married to the Sea
[[Image:Urine-sample.gif|thumb|right|One of the many intricate everyday dillemas you're surely to find on ''Married to the sea'' on a daily basis.]]

A [[webcomic]] trying to pass off as funny that is actually genuinely funny. Married to the sea depicts one-window cartoons usually derived from old Victorian lithographs provided of text by the site's maintainers.
Never taking the path of shock or [[racism]], but always revelled by a light-hearted ambiance of tepid and at times inane humor, a succes formula that works, this comic is probably one of the few in existence worthy of praise. HAHAHA, DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS

The site is funded and maintained by a married couple, namely [[Drewtoothpaste|Drew]] and [[Oldnataliedee|Natalie Dee]], each also running another daily webcomic of their own, which are both complete [[shit]], with here and there a little refreshening almond of [[funny]], but shitty nevertheless.
