==What was supposed to happen?==

[[File:Runningpope.jpg|200px|thumb|right|He wants your boys!]]

The only higher profile target than a religion is a country. But anon said, "Fuck it, let's do a country that's also a religion's HQ." That's why we're gunning for The Vatican. That, and the fact that it's small with limited IT infrastructure. It's an Ideal Target for us. 

Also, since it's high profile, the attack is guaranteed news coverage as long as it hits hard, does damage, and can be sustained for several days. 

This operation will be the work of Anonymous, but to make it the biggest shitstorm possible, we're going to collect attaches from various other communities, to do this, we need a moralfag acceptable reason. We have it. God Provided.
"The pope aided a pedophile priest, and claims to be the man closest to God."

===Manifesto, or, a lesson on how to fail in the most srs way===
{{Quote|Anon has attacked many targets in the past. People. Groups. Organizations. Corporations... even foetuses.
And still, it is not enough. Oh, we've made the news. Hell, we've even got a fucking wikipedia article. But if you walked up to an average person and asked them, "What is Anonymous?" You'd get the websters definition, not--

The group that took down Subeta.
That crippled a thousand online games.
That got enough attention from the CoS to get a documentary made.
That shut down Second Life for a week.

It's just a matter of statistical fact that most people, even now, do not know of us. If they know, they do not fear.

It is time to change that.

It is time, to change everything.

==What Happened?==
[[File:Fuckingnewfags.png|right|300px|thumb|OK, seriously, this shit is just getting old]]

Once upon a time, in [[4chan|a far away land of magic and wonder]], a bunch of [[Newfags|raidfags]] decided that it would be a [[Anonymous Borg|good idea]] to try something "big", a la Chanology, by [[Mordor|invading the Vatican]].  Following the fail-train that has been the last many raids done in this way, an overly [[srs bsns|srs]] Declaration of War was issued, complete with [[Autotune|voice synthesizer]], generic headless suit/ominous background image, and [[Asperger's syndrome|intimidating]] statements about [[lolwut|unending war until the collapse of the Vatican itself]].

Unfortunately, a 2000 year old institution with billions of dollars and well over [[Over 9000|a billion]] members is just a bit more resilient than [[Scientology|a religion whose members are most well known for being rich and jumping on couches]].  Consider for a moment that this organization has <s>perhaps</s> '''definitely''' hundreds of [[Pope|high ranking pedophiles]], and that even in the face of this their believers aren't even phased.  The Vatican is the single oldest continually operating [[troll]] group, having taken part in the [[Obama|gassing of jews]] under [[Bush|Hitler's Regime]] and so this raid was an example of [[Fellatio|trolls trolling trolls]].

This problem became apparent when the weekend ended and the most prominent members of the raid had to go back to school, on threat of their mommy taking away their computer.  The specified raid date [[I Came|came]] and went, with nothing happening except the creation of several more [[Youtube|semen-gurgling war videos]] (because the most influential religious group in the world ought to be scared shitless of an anonymous message on youtube, [[Fail|amirite]]?).

== What you can do to <s>make this succeed</s> get a cease and desist letter and do absolutely nothing==

# Get [[LOIC]]. http://partyvan.info/wiki/LOIC
# On May 25th, 6PM-UTC, aim at vatican.va, set to full power.
# <big><big><big>FIRE!</big></big></big>
# ?????
# PROFIT!

==Trolling==
Not all is lost, since there is still a way you can troll your local [[Catholic]] [[pedo|Priest]].

'''A bishop then must be''' blameless, '''the husband of one wife''', [[nice guy|temperate, sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach]]; not given to wine, not violent, not [[capitalism|greedy for money]], but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous; '''one who rules his own house well, [[The Man|having his children in submission with all reverence]] (for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?)'''; not a [[newfag|novice]], lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the [[4chan|same condemnation as the devil]].
