Windows Live Spaces

'''[http://spaces.msn.com Windows Live Spaces]''' is similar to [[LiveJournal]] and other [[blog]]ging websites, but offers [[at least 100]] 'extra' (read: '[[shit]]ty') features such as image hosting, trackbacks, and lists -- in other words, nothing that couldn't be provided by ImageShack, a [[Goatse|hyperlink]] and a [[penis|pen]]. 

All these features combined with an [[crap|innovative]] ASP.NET backend mean that accessing any part of Windows Live Spaces requires a 6 GHz processor, 1 TB of RAM and [[1337]] MB/s [[internets]] connection, which makes it twice as [[slut|easy]] to load as the average [[MySpace]] profile. Also, Windows Live Spaces are even less reliable in any browser other than [[Internet Explorer]], because [[Microsoft]] [[hacker|haXX0red]] their own software to make it work slower. Since updating a Windows Live Space blog is almost impossible for most consumer-grade PCs, most spaces only have one or two entries, or at least that's all you can read before the page meta-refreshes and won't load again.

Like all blog websites, Windows Live Spaces is a good source of [[emo]] [[poetry]] and [[internet disease]].
