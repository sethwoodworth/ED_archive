'''[http://99chan.org 99chan]''' is a recreated [[78chan]]. They have some cool elitist [[mods]] and shitty boards. If it is [[fail|win]] or not is up for debate but what is fact is that whatever this chan does it does at 1/4 the speed of all other chans leading some to believe it is being hosted on a mod's iphone.  This board is slow as balls.  A post about someone's birthday will literally be there next year, with about 2 posts more.  If you're used to the [[Epic|epic]] speed of [[4chan|4chan's]] [[b|/b/]], prepare to be disappointed.

In June of 2008 Zimmy decided that he was going to abandon [[78chan]] because he was a faggot. This lead to the users creating their own chan with most of the same staff. The name chosen was 99chan and the domain was purchased. The site was run by Sundevil and ATG and they continue to operate the website with the added help of other admins lolbifrons and regs who were promoted from moderators. Since Zimmy has left 99chan was in need of a coder, some faggot from ireland named ohgod stepped up and took the job. He then became a power hungry son of a bitch and shortened his name to just oh. Oh is pretty much Zimmy with a different name as far as anyone can tell.

78chan now lives inside 99chan. That means all their boards are in /78chan/. This is pretty [[cool]] though, since after you're b& from 99chan you can go and get b& on 78chan. <br>[http://99chan.org/78chan/news.php#9 AND THEN GET UNB& FOR 30$!]

On 99chan, it is almost guaranteed you will receive a ban as soon as you make a post. This is because users at 99chan <s>think they</s> are better than the rest of the [[chan|chan culture]] and pride themselves on being more <s>articulate and mature</s> [[fail|SUPERIOR]].

The users are neolithic troglodytes, with barely any grasp on the English language or any concept of grammar, spelling, or sentence structure.  Reading through a thread is an exercise in patience, as you futilely try to decode the typos and sentence fragments into something readable.  These [[newfag|newfags]] can't even spell "[[Mudkip|Mudkips]]" right!

The mods of 99chan are absolutely terrible, and the worst part of it is that there is a <b>FUCKTON</b> of them.  For every Anonymous, there are [[over 9000]] modfags waiting to unleash the banhammer.  If you expect to post anything on any board without getting permabanned, good luck.  Any post that isn't about sucking up to their tiny modcocks will earn you a one week ban, or worse.

Every single mod on 99chan is an enormous fag.  The worst has to be DerpDerp, the most enormous [[troll|trolling]] [[newfag|newfag]] to ever [[fag|fag]] up the [[internet|internets]].  Without any provocation, he will bullshit a reason to [[b&|ban]] you.  [[At least 100|At least 3/4]] of the userbase has been [[b&|b&]] by him, which would explain why the site is so fucking [[slowpoke|slow]].

Not to be outdone by the [[mod|mods]], the [[admin|admins]] have proven time and time again that they are enormous cocksuckers.  zn3t has locked /b/ [[over 9000|over 9000]] times, and is a self-proclaimed [[Scientology|Scientologist]].  He and his team of [[faggot|faggots]] ensure that no self-respecting [[Anonymous|Anonymous]] can do shit.
