The next piece of [[lulz]] brought to you by the maker of [[frienditto]]. 

Few people know what narcopolo will actually do, but it is rumored to hijack your [[LiveJournal]] and delete it, using the cached passwords from the earlier [[frienditto]] scandal. Once the content is deleted from the [[LiveJournal]] servers, it will be reposted to the narcopolo servers, along with all private and [[friends only]] entries. Once this happens, users will have the opportunity to pay a fee to narcopolo to have their top secret memes removed from the public internet. This will most likely not be cheap.

When someone on [[LiveJournal]] says "Narco", all participants who wish for their memes to remain safe must respond with "Polo" or risk having their entire journal published.
