'''Proposition 8''' is the [[California]] initiative that protects [[homo]]sexuals from [[marriage]]. The initiative was started by [[mormons]] to protect [[you|the misguided]] from making the same mistake they made.

On the [[Last Thursday|last Wednesday]] in [[2008]], the bill made it onto the [[California]] ballot. This legislation caused a [[goatse|great divide]] between those of differing ideologies, and [[some argue]]d it would beckon the coming of [[Tacgnol]]. This legislation was known as '''Proposition 8'''; which ultimately ended up passing, causing [[California]] to be dangerously on the brink between America and converting over to Dumbfuckistan.

==What the Proposition Entailed==

[[Image:Berterniep8.jpg|thumb|right|Until your shitty show gets cancelled, of course.]]

Before the arrival of the Proposition, [[homosexual]]s were allowed to [[marriage|marry]] in California. The Proposition was designed to do the [[christfag|world]] a service and [[Holocaust|rid them]] of this "[[bullshit|right]]". Every [[fag]], [[dyke]], [[transvestite]], and [[fag enabler]] got extremely [[butthurt]] at the notion of this legislation. Since [[gay]]s are every [[liberal]]'s favorite new minority (sorry, black person), every [[fagnostic]] and [[hippie]] tried to rally people against the extreme [[win]] the Proposition brought.  

However, their plans to ride the coattails of black butthurt for [[At least 100|the past 100 years]] to victory [[fail]]ed, since blax (who are mostly FLAMING Christfags) and [[retards|teh rest of society]] understands that, regardless of how much [[Glenn Beck|socialist propaganda]] the liberals shove down their throats, [[God hates fags|God still hates fags]].  Extra lulz since [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/11/elton-john-is-e.html this includes Elton John], a washed-up cockrocker who may be best known today for spewing AIDS-saturated anal barf all over [[Princess Diana]]'s funeral - with his stirring rendition of "Candle In the Ass."

Overall, the bill was about taking away the legal marriages in California that had already taken place beforehand, but effective trolling by [[mormons|fag-haters]] used such sales pitches as it being about kids being adopted by a mommy and daddy, even though no one wants to adopt nigger babies from Ethiopia anyway--God gave them AIDS for a reason, people. Anyway, even though the bill had nothing to do with adoption and more so with taking away other people's rights to marry, because it is a obvious fact that when you take away the ability for fags to get married, they automatically become straight, and white.

==Those For==
[[Image:Mjprop8.jpg|thumb|Typical Proposition 8 ad.]]
The ones that said yes to Prop 8 were [[Whores|concerned mothers]], [[Niggers|black people]], [[Spics|Mexicans]], and [[conservatives|closet cases]] nervous that seeing teh fagz getting married would make it harder to conceal their [[Ted Haggard|homosexual lust]]. As [[Bill O'Reilly|everyone]] knows, no one cares about marrying and living the American dream more than rapidly breeding for welfare and bling; niggers and spics. It's common knowledge that niggers h8 faggots, and will team up with [[White|the man]] every blue moon to fag drag them, thereby creating small amounts of [[Win|world peace]].

Plus, mouth breathing conservatives love seeing words like "Yes" and pretty pastel colors with pictures of families on their signs, instead of nasty blue and angry "No" ones. 

Additionally, Knuckle-draggers reasoned that them querrs gettin' married would affect their right to get drunk and ride around in their pickups, shooting at brown people, and also came up strong for the proposition.


An [[Christfag|inspiration]] to us all...

==Those Against==
[[File:Americuntfreedom.jpg|thumb|If you are against prop 8,you are a [[socialist]],a [[communist]],an [[why do you hate america|america hater]],and a [[faggot]].]]
Fucking butt plugging faggots, carpet munching dykes, and [[transvestites]]. Except trannys are the opposite sex so technically doesn't that count as being straight? It's also [[bullshit|common knowledge]] that gays hate niggers, and many were butthurt (for obvious reasons, amirite?) when one became president--wtf nigras?? [[X? In My Y?|In MY White House?!?!]] ([[Black Jesus|It's more likely than you think!]]) And I still can't rim my luver while our two year old adopted son watches and beats off?! So the news, being the clever fuckers they are, decided to get statements from some faggots who wanted a piece of the spotlight. Did they get it from Tom, the nice gay guy who lives next door? Steve, the PFLAG activist who works at the community college? No, they got their waaaaambulance statements from [[Win|racist transvestites]].

===Aftermath===


Once their proposition had passed, [[conservatives|conservitards]] and  [[christfags]] gave one another [[gay|non-homoerotic]] slaps on the ass for demonstrating their [[faggotry|heterosexual pride]] and [[bullshit|love of the lord]].

Lefties were enraged at the [http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2009/01/07/7857 overwhelming support] that blacks displayed for prop 8, and took the opportunity to show how caring and tolerant they were by [http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/nov/08111212.html lashing out at nigras] (with liberal use of racial slurs), whether said nigras had supported it or not. [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008371441_protest10m.html Even more rage] was directed at the [[Mormon]] Church, [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,705262137,00.html with calls for a] [[Shit nobody cares about|boycott]]. Nothing says "diversity" like economic warfare!

==The Passage of Proposition 8==

[[Image:Mormonbashings1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Montel_Williams|Liberals are peaceful, loving people.]]]]

Proposition 8 was passed, and [[conservative]]s around the world rejoiced as the liberals could no longer [[Britney Spears|tarnish marriage]]. However, the [[drama]] was only just beginning. The [[Mormon]] church had given bullshit amounts of money (don't worry, starving children, spending all that money on keeping gays out of matrimony was [[fuck you|well worth it!]]) and told its members to vote in favor of passing the Proposition (OR ELSE GOD WILL SMITE YOU THE FUCK UP). [[Liberal]]s, butthurt that the Proposition passed, tried to file [[lolsuit]]s against the [[cult|church]] to revoke its tax-exempt status. However, they were [[pwn]]ed since nobody gives a shit about gays (money talks, bullshit walks) anyway.

Huge update! As of August 4, 2010, proposition 8 has been overturned. Is no anus safe?

==[[Web 2.0]] "Activis"m==

[[Image:Prop8handsignals.jpg|thumb|right|No one knows what they're trying to say. Probably something along the lines of "finger me NOW". This march was organized via Facebook.]]

Most activism against prop 8 hasn't gone past [[Facebook]]. If you actually have [[friends]], it is highly likely that at least one of them has joined a group for [[BAWWW]]ing about the Proposition's victory. [[Over 9000]] such groups have been created so far, and what most people don't realize is, immediately after joining any of these groups, [[lulz|everyone will think you are gay]].

==[[IRL]] activism==

[[Image:Marriageisloveirl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marriage is love]], [[IRL]]. Of course, those [[lesbian|rug munchers]] are quite butthurt about the Proposition.]]

Since [[leftard]]s can't settle for fagging up web 2.0, they decided to take their [[Failbook]] groups to the streets and organize [[fat|massive]] marches and protests to show the world how butthurt they are. The gallery below should explain more than you ever wanted or needed to know. Most of the images are taken from the [[San Francisco]], [[Nawlins]], [[Seattle]], and [[Los Angeles]] protests.

==lol jk==
On August 4, 2010, in the case of ''Perry v. Schwarzenegger'', Judge Vaughn Walker overturned Proposition 8 on the grounds that it violated the some amendments or something lol. Faggot sympathizer Vaughn Walker went on to say,

{{quote|FABULOUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS|Judge Vaughn Walker, [http://abovethelaw.com/2010/02/the-prop-8-judge-may-be-gay-does-it-matter/ known homosexual]}}

In the case, they cited the 14th amendment which grants equal protection under the law. Suspiciously enough they never brought up whether fags were human, in which case they would not be covered. The trial was fishy all around. The defense team was lacking in witnesses and evidence and there was a gay judge. Just another example of the federal government bullying the states on state issues. But what can we do to fix this [[abomination]]?
===But encyclopedia dramatica, does this mean the faggots have won?===
No young reader. This case will be appealed and it may end up going to the Supreme court. Pray to our loving God and we may succeed,
