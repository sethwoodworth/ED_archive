Capcom

'''Capcom''' (short for Crapcom) is a Japanese video game company that produces games for fags who like endless [[zombie]] maiming or faggot [[robots]] who shoot [[Testicles|balls]] at their other faggot robot enemies. [[Shit nobody cares about|Their name is based on their original company name "Capsule Computer".]] But the thing that makes it an epic win is that it actually GIVES A SHIT about its classics such as Mega Man up to the point of bringing it back to it's [[Awesome|8-Bit glory]]

==Fanbase==
Since Capcom has produced some of the most [[shitty|successful]] game franchises in history, each of them have [[fantards]] who will [[BAWWWWW|fight to the death]] if anyone dares to slander the reputation of their favorite games. More rabid fans may even get [[butthurt|angry]] at Capcom if they don't make a certain game a system exclusive. Such is dictated in this [[ALL CAPS]] rant on ''Devil May Cry 4''. The very fact that the game would be available on the [[Xbox 360]] in addition to the [[PS3]] drove this user to the point of insanity.

{{quote|THATS IT [[Censorship|F*CK]] THIS IM BOUT TO GO ALL F*UCKING OUT ON DIS COMMENT I AM SICK OF CAPCOM I HATE IT IM GONNA GATHER UP ALL MY CAPCOM GAME AND PUT UM IN A PILE WITH DMC ON TOP AND TAKE IT TO CAPCOM'S CENTER AND [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|BURN THE GAMES]] ALONG WITH THE REST OF CAPCOM THEN GO TO [[Mexico|MEXICO]] WHERE I CANT BE HARMED BY [[Fanboys|SONY HATERS/CAPCOM LOVERS]] CAUSE IN MEXICO ALL CRIMES U DO IN OTHER COUNTRIES WELL DA MEXICAN GOVERNMENT [[Truth|CANT DO ANYTHING BOUT IT]] B!TCHES. AND I'M F*CKIN SERIOUS TOO.IF CAPCOM RELEASES F.CKIN DMC 4 ON DAT HORRIBLE LOOKING SHI.T [[Xbox 360|36O]] I MA BURN THEIR SHI.TY BASE AND MURDER [[Bill Gates|BILL GATES]] FOR A F*CKIN GAME AND I'M [[Batshit crazy|CRAZY]] ENOUGH TO DO IT B!TCHES SO FU.CK 360 AND FU.CK MICROSOFT CAUSE THE ONLY GOOD EXCLUSIVES THEY EVER HAD ARE THE [[Halo|HALO]] SERIES AND NINJA GAIDEN AND GUESS WAT THEY DON'T HAVE NINJA GAIDEN ANYMORE.THATS RIGHT HOORAY CAUSE NINJA GAIDEN IS WAY BETTER THAN DMC SO TEAM NINJA COMES OUT SMARTER THAN CAPCOM SO FU.CK DMC CAUSE PS3 HAS A WAY BETTER GAME AND DON'T NEED DMC I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS PETITION IS STILL GOING ON.PS3|CoMMon Sense, [[Lie|living up to his namesake]]}}

And another one. [[Bitches don't know]] about the concept of multi-platform releases. It brings in more monies for the company so they can continue to make their little games. 

{{quote|Devil May cry is an exclusive the PS3 needs to help it along its path to becoming a viable next gen system, it is not the only game needed, but is still very helpful to the PS3s line-up. Multi-platform releases may help Capcom make more [[Jew gold|money]] initially,but it also contributes to the destruction of a gaming system and the over-all dumbing down of game quality that occurs from multi-platform releases. If Capcom chooses to release DMC4 in a multiplatform matter I will boycott their games.|Nameless Sonytard, failing to understand the concept of good marketing.}}

==Their Games==
Capcom has been responsible for a number of game franchises:
* '''''Breath of Fire''''' - Some kind of [[RPG]](???) game that was forgotten on [[last_thursday|last thursday]].
* '''''[[Street Fighter]]''''' - A fighting game where you [[rape|beat]] the crap out of your opponents. All of them are 2D with the exception of the fourth one.
* '''''[[Megaman]]''''' - [[Boring]] action game involving a [[13 year old boy]] robot who kills other robots. Most of the other spinoffs are even more boring strategy games.
* '''''[[Phoenix Wright]]''''' - A faggot lawyer needs the help of kids and dead people to solve cases in the most retarded legal system [[evar]]. Basically just an [[Internet court]] simulator where you must settle [[lolsuit|lawsuits]] by throwing constant [[Objection|objections]].
* '''''[[Resident Evil 4|Resident Evil]]''''' - You go around, kill zombies and [[Silent Hill|avoid getting raped]]. Whoops, wrong game.
*'''''[[Dino Crisis 2|Dino Crisis]]''''' - Resident Evil with dinosaurs.  About as stupid as a fever dream.
* '''''[[Dead Rising]]''''' - Same as RE except you just kill a bunch of zombies using various weapons.
* '''''Devil May Cry''''' - Button mashing romp where you play as a [[otherkin|half human/half demon]] with a too-cool-for-you attitude while fighting demons. In the fourth game, you don't play as Dante but as some [[Emo|whiny shit]] named Nero. Capcom pulled an MGS on its fanbase apparently.
* '''''Darkstalkers''''' - The same as ''Street Fighter'', but with [[furries]] and [[otherkin]].
* '''''Strider''''' - You Jump, slash, Dash, that's it. Oh, and it has a plot [[nobody gives a shit]] about.
* '''''Bionic Commando''''' - Game where you play as a guy with an arm that extends. Notable for the fact that you get to see [[Hitler|Hitler's]] head a splode at the end of the game.
* '''''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''''' - They distribute this game in [[Japan]] because they think they're [[hardcore]].
* '''''Monster Hunter''''' - A game no one outside [[Japan]] gives a shit about. [[Weeaboos]] love it since they can use a longsword, and be just like their hero, [[Sephiroth]].
*'''''Viewtiful Joe''''' - A game where a guy in a tight red suit with a pink cape goes and saves his game using movie powers but the only one you will use is slow-down.
* '''''God Hand''''' - [[Godhand Edit|FUCK YES! YOU ARE THE BEST CAPCOM GAME EVER!]]
* '''''Okami''''' - [[The Legend of Zelda]] for [[furfags|furries]]
