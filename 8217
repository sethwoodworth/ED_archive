[[Image:The 2007 Habbo Raid was a great success.jpg|thumb|right|A /b/tard spokesman announcing the great success of the 7/12/07 Habbo raid.]]

On July 12, 2007, suited [[nigra|nigras]] worldwide once more achieved epic [[lulz]] by repeating the legendary [[The Great Habbo Raid of July 2006|Habbo Hotel Raid of July 12, 2006]]. By clogging up every room in the [[faggot]]-infested Habbo Hotel, the nappy-headed-hoes' giant afros blocked entrances, stairs and hallways with their giant afro hairs. Reports of a few Habbofags injured by flying afro picks abounded during the evening, and the Habbosphere Pool Deck was paralyzed due to [[AIDS]] and [[stingrays]]. 

The entire raid was a success, and suited nigras everywhere were victorious, forcing the racist moderators to admit their guilt in the atrocities of 9/11, as well as infecting them with sickle-cell anemia. Much to the delight of sharply-dressed nigras everywhere, the Kool-Aid Guy made a surprise appearance throughout the evening to show his support for the legendary raid and bring ice cold <strike>watermelon-flavored drinks</strike> <strike>GRAPE DRANK</strike> Kool-Aid for the thirsty brothas. Although a few nigras were forcibly removed from the premises by mods who stuck Velcro to the ceiling, the world shall truly Never 4get how the fans of [[ebaums|ebaumsworld.com]] created a sea of piss that fateful evening.

No word yet on whether the nigras will attempt to bring similar mayhem to a convenience store or a fried chicken stand near you. However it is likely that the great habbo raid of July will become an event similar to Christmas or Quanza aka. "Nigger Christmas"  for [[/b/tards]] everywhere to spread good tidings and warnings of aids.

== Premature E/b/laculation ==

A great source of fail in the raid started the night before, on July 11th, when [[retard]]s began donning suits and fros and strolling to the pool deck in a [[fucktard]]edly early fashion.  Experts have blamed everyone from [[Ebaumsworld]] to [[gaia]]fags to NBA all-star black person.

== Reverse buttsecks!! ==

Early on in the day, the [[Habbo]] [[Gay|Mods]] employed a [[retarded|clever]] tactic in the form of a global message to all Habbos that read as such: 

 Message from Habbo staff: For those who didn't know. Today is international afro-suit day! If  
 your feeling the effects of a sugar high, put on an afro/suit and PARTY! Watch out though, I  
 hear those Afro wigs have lice. Ewwww! PS don't send calls for help about the Afros, just  
 join them!

To [[some argue|some]], this has been seen as epic [[win]] for all raiding [[nigra]]s, in that the mods appeared to advocate NOT reporting /b/lockers and also show their true racist side by suggesting all black people have lice.  Indeed, one could truly smell the [[butthurt]] beginning to [[secks|permeate]] the air around the [[Habbo Hotel]].  (It should be noted that with the previous message of approval for the Nigras, the mods likely ended up banning a large number of their own [[13-year-old boy|people]].)

== Win/Fail ==

[[Image:SWASTIGET.JPG|thumb|A True Swastiget. NEVAR FORGET!]]Although controversy has erupted among /b/tards as to whether the raid was truly win, Habbo '07 can be considered both [[Win]] and [[Fail]].  Large amounts of evidence indicate that the raid was, in fact, a success: Habbo.com was shut down for a large amount of time and flickered back up intermittently, while foreign hotels remained raided pretty badly.  Many, however, deplore the lack of coordination relative to the '06 raid, resulting in failed SwastiGETs and rampant chaos.  Despite the differences, however, most /b/tards agreed it was a lulzy event.

[[The Great Habbo Raid Of July 2008]]<br>

"Remember us". As simple an order as a /b/rother can give. "Remember why we were b&". For we don't wish tribute or song. No monuments, no songs of war and valour. Our wish is simple: "Remember us". That is our hope. Should any free soul come across that place, in all the countless centuries and GETS yet to be, may all our voices whisper to you from the ageless interbutt: Go tell the /b/tards, passer-by, that here by habbo law we lie.
