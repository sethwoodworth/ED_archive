'''Card Crusher''', also known as the '''rude dude''' or '''Zoomjap''' is an old-as-the-internet-itself [[4chan]] /a/ [[meme]], consisting of a series of strips based on Professor Himonya (碑文谷教授 in [[moonspeak]]), a [[rude]] Professor of Linguistics from the University of Tokyo (who apparently is an expert on making people [[anal|uncomfortable]]), who goes on Japanese TV and creates [[lulz]] by insulting various presenters. It began when a certain /a/sshole posted a [[YouTube]] link of him being interviewed.

The twist of the video happens when Professor Himonya gives the female interviewer a business card and asks her to pretend it's hers. She then presents the business card back to him; he looks at it, smiles, and then proceeds to crush it in his fist and hold it to her face, whilst maintaining a pose and goofy facial expression. In [[Japan]], business cards are [[serious business]], so doing this is the [[Code Geass|eleven]] version of [[rape|raping]] someone else's family pet in front of them.

==The comic version==
In response to the video, an eleven from [[Futaba]] made his own comic strip version of the scene, depicting Konata as Professor Himonya, Kagami as the interviewer and a choco cornet being crushed in place of the card. It was translated, and the comic and video circulated around /a/ for a while. The meme truly took off when an /a/sshole decided to make his own MSpaint version of the comic, featuring Simon, Rossiu and the core drill from Gurren Lagann. Shortly after, an [[Oh Exploitable]] template was made, and the meme took off on /a/. It also eventually made its way into /v/ and finally migrated to /b/ as ''is that sum [[Original Content]]''

In the spinoff strips, a character usually holds something of immense value for the second character, before crushing it front of their face, followed by a zoom-in of the trademark facial shot.
