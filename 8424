'''Tim Todd''' is just your average [[Bible]]-thumping, right-winged, bigoted moron/possible [[troll]]. What makes him so LULZ-y is his website, http://www.thetruthforyouth.com and the "Hot Comics" that can be read there. These comics are intended to help teenagers with [[evil|important]] issues such as [[pornography]],[[homosexuality]], [[condom|safe sex]] (or lack there of), [[abortion]], rock [[music]], [[School_Shootings|school violence]], [[evolution]], [[drugs]], drunkenness and peer pressure.

==Purpose==
[[Image:Ttodd new.jpg|thumb|right|He will [[cockmongler|suck your cock]].]]
{{squote|In response to the tragic killings of students and teachers, we have launched a national “Bibles Not Bullets” campaign to legally smuggle Bibles into the public schools of America! Consider this: There has never been one law passed to prohibit the distribution of Bibles in America’s public schools. It is lawful for young people to give “The Truth for Youth” Bible to other students in their school, on school grounds.

Pay special attention to the powerful comics in this Bible. They tell the youth the absolute truth about the moral issues confronting them today.

Recently, I joined my dad, Cecil Todd, founder of the Revival Fires Ministry, for a missions project in Moscow, Russia. We were asked by the Ministry of Education, who oversees the entire school system in Russia, to assist in providing Bibles as textbooks in their public schools. Vladimir Saprykin, vice-president of the Ministry of Education, gave the approval. His enthusiastic endorsement prompted him to ask, “What kind of a Bible program do you have for the public schools in America?” I responded, “Russia put God in school, but America kicked God out!”

All the way home I pondered: America is a country that was founded on Biblical standards but today many are trying to stop us from giving Bibles to the students in America’s public schools.

Thank God, thousands of people across America are concerned and outraged that Bible reading and prayer in our public schools is prohibited. And yet, Bibles are being distributed freely in public schools of Russia and even required reading in some of their classes! Now, our public schools have become a breeding ground for sin and lawlessness. Young people are being given condoms, but Bibles are forbidden! We have had to create drug free zones today as a result of creating Bible free zones in the sixties.

I am determined, if students can distribute Bibles in the public schools of Russia, our young people should be able to distribute Bibles in the public schools of America too!
I believe our public schools are the biggest mission field in America. Certainly, much more is needed than just handing out Bibles, but this is a good place to start. Over one million students carry guns to school every day. Let’s replace those bullets with Bibles and return God to our public schools!|-Tim Todd ramblings.}}

==Comics==

Tim Todd is very proud of his book: "THE TRUTH FOR YOUTH", which is really a series of short comics (mentioned earlier). Not only do these comics seem to take on a slightly manga-esque style in order to [[pedobear|attract kids]], but the characters also tend to use current slang such as "phat", "wicked" and "totally twisted". For some reason, almost all the comics end with the character receiving a copy of the book, and praying to God to forgive their sins.

==Harry Potter is EVIL!==

Like all good church-going people know, [[Harry Potter]] is a work of [[Satan]]. Fortunately, Tim Todd is here to write comics for children to read and learn the truth about their favorite book series. Now all he has to do is make comics about the evils of [[Twilight]], and a whole generation may well be rescued.

God, my own religion pisses me off.
I mean, yeah. There's no secret whatsoever that there's been a never ending [[war|battle]] between the good ol' conservative Christian army and the Britain-based Harry Potter fantasy series. I've seen everything from protests to book burning to outright assault on people who defend it in the wake of Christianity. But you know what I've seen through all these debates and arguments? The ever-growing and ever-present mindset that all Christians are uber-uptight assholes who wouldn't know tolerance if it bit them in their holy buttcrack. It really sucks, because in my inner circle of friends, I've been trying to prove the opposite of the typical worldview of this religion, and show that [[lie|we can be everyday people who won't try to convert you every time you open your mouth and voice an opinion we don't agree with]]. But it's always going to be pretty damn hard to accomplish a task such as that when we have the outspoken Christian fanatics mucking up our attempts to be accepted as reasonable human beings. Take Tim Todd, for example. Aside from being one of the nutjobbiest nutjobs to ever hit the evangelical douchebag circuit, Mr. Todd has also penned a "[[comic|graphic novel]]" entitled The [[Truth]] For Youth, which consists of several six-page comics supposedly teaching young people the truth about our eeee-vil secular world, with footnotes directing you to various Bible verses obviously dispersed throughout. As you could probably imagine, these are pretty friggin funny. Every one of them is basically untrue, manipulative, and above all, just flat out stupid. For example, here is a list of some of the stories and their basic moral lesson:

'''Safe Sex'''. It doesn't exist. It's been scientifically proven that condoms fail 100% of the time. The only safe sex is abstinence, so when you DO get married and can't afford to have that baby, good luck figuring the contraceptives out, you poor uneducated bastard!

'''Rock Music'''. If it isn't choir or gospel music, it's evil. Every band ever formed is trying to convert you to hate God and worship Satan. Anyone who has an opinion that doesn't have to do with God in any remote way is a sinner.

'''Evolution'''. Carbon-14 dating has been proven to be highly inaccurate, but Carbon-14 dating has been used to prove the Earth is only as old as the Bible says. Keep your facts consistent, Todd.

'''Pornography'''. Every person who ever looked at porn in their life will grow up to abuse women, become serial rapists and think of sex as nothing special. Your hormones make you a bad person. Ask God to help you stop touching yourself when you're, like, ten.

'''Homosexuality'''. You're pretty much fucked.

There are several others following in this same vein, and they're all equally funny both in their unbelievably inaccurate depiction of the topic at hand, and in their drawing style that elicits some serious guffaws all around. But nothing, and I mean nothing, could prepare you for the laugh overload that is Tim Todd's response to the Harry Potter craze. This big, dumb, gloriously retarded little tome is entitled Hairy Polarity and the Sinister Sorcery Satire, and is available for three bucks on the guy's website. Unfortunately, I have yet to order this thing in full, but I couldn't wait to dig my teeth into this one. He has the first seven pages (of thirty-two) available on his web site, and I'm gonna rip these things something fierce. Following is my typical verbal assault on all things in pop culture that irk me, and I hope you will enjoy. For now, it's just a sampling. But here you are, loyal readers.

==I-CAN and I-RAN==

{{squote|'''The last four letters of the word "AMERICAN" are "I-CAN" not "I-RAN"!'''

It seems our country's Christian computer users are divided into two groups: the "I-CANS" and the "I-RANS"! For too many years in America the Christian computer users have been "I-RANS". They "RUN" from dealing with sin on the internet that concerns us as Christians. They would "RUN" from implementing innovative tools to win the sinner on the internet. They "RUN" from the need to reach those who are searching for satisfaction through: pornography, homosexuality, sexual promiscuity, secular rock music, drugs, drunkenness, sorcery and witchcraft.

Too many spiritual voices on the internet have "RUN" from taking a stand on the moral issues. Either they don't know exactly what to do or they have been brain washed by the liberal news media and made to believe that certain issues are political and a "man of the cloth" should not get involved in "politics"!

But praise God, we have a growing breed of Christian "INTERNET I-CANS"!

"I-CAN" and I must stand up and call sin on the internet by its first name!

"I-CAN" and I must reach out to lost people who are filling their hearts and minds with pornography! 	
"I-CAN" and I must reach the homosexual with the message of God's love and deliverance from their perverted lifestyle! 	
"I-CAN" and I must tell people the truth about "safe sex" according to God's Word. God requires for us to live a sexually pure life! 	
"I-CAN" and I must reach young ladies considering "abortion", or who have already had an "abortion", with a message of LIFE and forgiveness! 	
I-CAN" and I must reach young people who are experimenting with or involved in "sorcery and witchcraft" to let them know the dangerous and deadly road they are traveling. Revelation 21:8 	
"I-CAN" and I must, in love, warn teenagers of the dangers of filling their hearts and minds with the rebellion that "secular rock music" is made up of! ANY music that conveys a message in opposition to God’s Word is not healthy. 	
"I-CAN" and I must reach the drug dealer, the drug addict and the alcoholic searching for peace through a temporary high and let them know that Jesus is the answer! 	
"I-CAN" and I must "tell it like it is" and then "tell it like it should be" in this computer age of internet pornography, promiscuity and pleasure seeking!

For far too long, to many Christian internet users have been passive in dealing with many of these moral issues, believing that "Silence is Golden". But thank God, more and more of God's servants now realize that "Silence is not always Golden", it can also be down right "yellow"!

Christians must get involved in dealing with sin on the internet that is destroying the soul of our nation. If we don't get involved we are traveling down the middle of the highway and could get hit from both sides. The only thing that I have found in the middle of the highway is a yellow line, dead skunks and luke-warm church leaders who refuse to take a stand on the hot issues of our day. The middle of the highway is a dangerous place to travel for man or beast and the consequences are many times fatal! I believe the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in an hour of national crisis, are unwilling to take a stand.

Our nation has so many Christian "INTERNET I-RANS" on the computer, not willing to confront the sin, that a deep spiritual erosion of our traditional values has resulted. While America played, satanic forces, hatched in hell, are filling the internet on all fronts.

More than sixty percent of the internet is made up of pornography. America's consumers spend more money on pornography internet than any other nation on the face of the earth.

The current sinful developments on the internet should compel us all to stand up and speak out or we too will end up in the devil's junk pile.

WHAT CAN THE RIGHTEOUS DO?

The Psalmist cried out, "If the foundation be destroyed, what can the righteous do? (Psalms 11:3)

God spoke it bluntly to the Prophet Ezekiel: He declared, "Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word of my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I say unto the wicked, thou shalt surely die; and thou givest them not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, BUT HIS BLOOD WILL I REQUIRE AT THINE HAND. Yet if thou shall warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou has delivered thy soul! (Ezekiel 3:17-19)

God made it very plain... "Warn the wicked of their wicked way" or their blood drips from our hands! Warn the wicked of their wicked ways or I will hold you responsible for what they are doing! That's mighty strong! Our God makes it abundantly clear... I believe He expects us to be "WEBSITE WATCHMEN"!

I believe a "COMPUTER USING CHRISTIAN AMERICAN" should be an "INTERNET I-CAN" not an "INTERNET I-RAN"..."WEBSITE WATCHMEN", directing lost men, women and young people to find Jesus Christ through the truthforyouth.com! Help us, "cast our net on the internet"! You will know the truth and the truth will set you free. (John 8:32) May God richly bless you!|-More Tim Todd ramblings.}}
