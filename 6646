Proposed deletion

'''Proposed deletion''', also known as '''PROD''', is a process of [[deletionist|deletion]] on [[TOW]]. Unlike [[AFD|Articles for deletion]] or the [[criteria for speedy deletion]], proposed deletion is the lamest of the three Wikipedia deletion processes. [[Wikipedo]]s basically use this process when they want an [[article]] to meet the serial rapist and murderer of articles known as the CSD in a dark, dirty street full of broken glass, heroin needles and used condoms, [[asking for it|alone at night]], but when because of their [[Bureaucratic Fuck|excessive rules]], they cannot put it to CSD.

Therefore, the article stays up for 5 days with a notice saying why one particular Wikipedo wants it deleted. It's a lame process because any [[butthurt]] [[newfag]] to TOW can remove the notice on their first article, and if it's not on the Wikipedo's watchlist, the article can slip by and remain in existence indefinitely. It also cannot be re-added to PROD if the notice is removed for any reason, and must be taken to AFD. Much easier just to press the delete button, like [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] does, than go through the [[bullshit]] of a complex set of rules that don't work anyway.

Types of articles that get prodded are non-controversial non-[[notable]] things such as internet [[meme]]s, books, software and music albums. Putting such articles to CSD is considered a Very Bad Thing on TOW, and is likely to result in lots of [[drama]] when on editor review or requests for [[sysop|adminship]].

==What Proposed Deletion Really Is==
Proposed deletion is rather like Jimbo's smug face - the Wikipedia admins are deleting your articles slyly, just like him [[the child in Africa|taking money off you slyly]] because you're dumb enough to donate.
