'''ACORN''' aka the '''Association of Corrupt Organizations for Reprobates Now''' or '''OBAMACORN''' was a U.S. government-funded organization of [[Chadwardenn|community organizers]] that advocated for [[niggers|poor people]] on issues of [[ghetto|neighborhood]] safety, [[fraud|voter registration]], [[herpes|health care]], [[brothel|affordable housing]] and other [[leftard]] social issues. In no way did the [[Black Jesus]] administration use it as an advocacy group for sex workers or a cover for doling out [[you|tax payer]] money and advice to wannabe pimps, hookers and general lowlifes.

==Scandal 2008==
In the runup to the [[2008]] US Presidential race, ACORN was accused of registering [[over 9000]] dead people, felons and [[beaners|illegal immigrants]] as [[Democrats]] whilst stumping for former Chicago community organizer [[Barack Obama]]'s campaign.

==Scandal 2009==

In the summer of [[2009]], ACORN was trolled multiple times by two [[Republifag]] college students, '''[[wigger|James O'Keefe]]''' and his partner '''[[prostitute|Hannah Giles]]''', with a hidden camera as they [[troll]]ed for dirt on the troubled organization. Posing as a [[pimp]] and his [[hooker]], the couple went to multiple ACORN offices across the country ostensibly to get advice on cheating the [[IRS]] out of boocoo [[Jew Golds]], providing cover and staying out of jail for their fictitious nefarious shenanigans. Since ACORN is staffed almost entirely by illiterate niggers who have never heard of [[Sasha Baron Cohen]], none of the trolling victims thought it the least bit odd that two whitebread, squeaky-clean kids were actually engaged in the [[porn|adult entertainment]] industry.

Only one ACORN staffer from San Bernardino, California smelled a rat and counter-trolled the dynamic duo by telling them she'd shot her ex-husband to death. In the video, she regales the trolls with stories of her past experiences in running an escort agency, and tells them that she killed her husband 10 years ago after laying ground for her defense by going to a shelter for battered women and bitching about her [[pimp|abusive husband]].

|I just picked up the gun and said 'fuck you'. And I shot him. And he died. Right there.|ACORN troll
|And I ran a service, yeah. I have some experience in how not to get caught.|ACORN troll}}

After these [[trolls|intrepid reporters]] notified the [[Cops|oinkers]], they found that the husband in question was alive and well. [[Fox News]] didn't let this [[fact]] get in the way of [http://www.examiner.com/x-3629-Philadelphia-Progressive-Examiner~y2009m9d17-Glenn-Beck-and-Fox-News-What-goes-around-has-come-around reporting the story just as the counter-troll told it to the world].

{{quote|This is journalistic malpractice plain and simple. A reporter right out of J-school would have taken the two minutes necessary to call the San Bernardino Police Department and verify Ms. Kaelke's statement. This never occurred to anyone at Fox News and it ran with the story.

'''James O'Keefe''' ([[V&]]) is an [[rich|Ivy League]] elitist [[faggot]] and self-described [[conservative]] [[USI|activist filmaker]] who blogs at [http://biggovernment.com/author/jokeefe/ the Big Government website]. When not [[OTI]], he enjoys going to ''Pimp & Ho'' parties with his mother's mink stole slung over his J. Crew [[NORP]] uniform. James also maintains [http://www.facebook.com/pages/James-OKeefe/135160737909 his own Facebook fanboy group]. This idiot recently made the news again when he and and his crew of [[Homosexual|loyal comrades]] attempted to [[rape|break into]] a [[whore|Senator's]] office while disguised as [[Anonymous|telephone repairmen]]. They have been charged with attempting to [[buttsecks|tamper]] with a government phone system, a federal offense which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail with [[bubba]]. 
Read about it [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/us/politics/27landrieu.html?scp=5&sq=acorn&st=cse here]!

'''Hannah Giles''' is a minister's daughter studying journalism at [[fake|Florida International University]]. She writes for [[Lemonparty|Townhall.com]] alongside her father, columnist [[douchebag|Doug Giles]].

According to her page at [http://biggovernment.com/author/hgiles/ Big Government], Giles claims to be "a 20 year old college student who became interested in [[SNCA|exposing social injustice and the abuses of power]] when she attended her first conference in Washington, DC in 2007." In her spare time, she enjoys being a [[cumdumpster|prop]] for James in his escapades and stepping stone to his [[IRL]] fame. However, since learning of the fantastic opportunities presented to a moderately good-looking young [[woman|filly]] her age from the experts at ACORN, now feels empowered as a woman and plans to break away from Big Daddy James, her [[leech|suitcase pimp]], and strike out on her own [[vagoo]]. She already has customers lining up on her [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hannah-Giles-is-HOT/135190811379?ref=search&sid=1795708144.3248341745..1 Facebook '''Hannah Giles is HOT''' group].

Hannah also maintains a [[Facebook]] fan page [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hannah-Giles/134395954012?ref=search&sid=1795708144.3248341745..1 here].

They claim that the ACORN trolling project cost them $1,300, and that they did it entirely on their own and paid for it themselves, which makes one wonder about the following statement:

==Official Reaction==
The [[Lemonparty|US Congress]] has voted to cut off government funding to ACORN while [[Butthurt|indignant]] politicos and whiny conservative [[talking head]]s are currently calling on officials to ramp up the the various probes underway that are examining the organization's funding and questionable [[lulz|activities]]. 

Since ACORN is comparable to many other advocacy groups that generate non-existent "[[zombies|voters]]" during registration drives (usually about one in three), this almost seems to be a pointless exercise, especially since it's not currently illegal to pay [[Jew gold|bounties]] to people and organizations to locate and recruit new voters, be they [[Democrat]]s, [[Republican]]s, [[centrist]]s, [[Libertarian]]s, [[hippies]], [[Nazi]]s or [[Santorum|the average fruit who enjoys phallic objects in his shit-chute]]. For example, former eBay President and CEO Meg Whitman is currently offering '''$3 a head''' for votes in her registration drive to replace [[The Governator]] of California.
