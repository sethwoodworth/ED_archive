Moonspeak
[[Image:Inuit-moonspeak.png|thumb|Errrr...]]
Generally, [[Americans]] refer to '''Moonspeak''' as any non-[[English]] language rather than using [[Greek]], because 87% of them lost all common sense when they gained independence from [[Europe]]; however, in common [[Internet]] parlance, the label specifically refers to any language that does not use the [[Latin]] alphabet. 

Moonspeak generally implies special fonts to read, either Unicode encoding or character set specific encoding to transmit, and either non-QWERTY keyboards or input systems to type.  As a result of these requirements, Moonspeak is a very fragile way of transmitting thoughts; lacking either the right set of fonts or the right encoding renders Moonspeak as a blob of squares. 

Consequently, Moonspeakers resort to arbitrary transliteration of their language into the [[Latin]] alphabet to quickly and reliably communicate. The only cure for moonspeak is [[fire]] or [[Esperanto]].
