Pervert
'''Pervert''', or '''prevert''', is a highly-subjective term, covering anyone who is into a sick, twisted [[fetish]] that isn't as enticing as the fetish [[YOU]] are into, thus making said person weird, unappealing, and/or disgusting.

A sex pervert generally crosses the line and becomes a [[sick fuck]] when his/her fetishes start involving [[Bestiality|animals]], [[Pedophile|children]], and/or [[Snuff|manslaughter]].
