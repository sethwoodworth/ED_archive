April Winchell/Commentary
{{Subpage|April Winchell}}<BR>
At first glance, April is an ED wet dream. Do not be fooled. [http://www.aprilwinchell.com/ April Winchell] is a [[coward]]. For someone whose internet celebrity relies fully on making fun of others, you'd think she could handle a little friendly ribbing.

You've heard of a site called [http://www.regretsy.com/ Regretsy]. It's a site for great justice. Someone needed to show the people of [[Etsy]] the truth about the real world. And the truth is, we don't care about your shit. '''(Oh yeah, that's EXACTLY what Regretsy is saying, and that's why any money generated by the site at all goes back to helping Etsy sellers in need.)'''

April jumped at the chance and launched Regretsy [[last thursday]].  '''(Genius!)'''

At first, everything was great and much lols were had. Then she called all people from Boston [http://www.regretsy.com/2010/05/04/puritanical-dickbags/ "Crab Hammering Puritanical Dick Bags"] '''(Nevermind. That's still pretty lol.)'''
Her next foray into offending the drooling masses was her unending use of the word "retard". '''(I love the word retard)'''

[http://www.regretsy.com/2010/10/01/calling-all-craftards/ retard]
[http://www.regretsy.com/2010/02/15/pillow-biter/ retard]

People were [[Pissed|outraged]]. 

People start unliking her [[Facebook]] [http://www.facebook.com/?ref=hp#!/regretsy page].  '''(Yeah.  Since then it's gone from havin 30K fans to having over 58K.  Keep talking about her and linking to the page, I'm sure you're raising curiousity!)'''

April tantrums like a little girl. '''(About what?  Flounces??  Ha! I've never seen a community or page admin that enjoyed flounces more!)'''

To counter, April throws their [http://www.facebook.com/?ref=hp#!/photo.php?fbid=10150139981880360&set=a.498265695359.387230.285066400359 exit speeches] up [http://www.facebook.com/?ref=hp#!/album.php?aid=387230&id=285066400359 in her flounce album]. '''(This paragraph is flouting out in the middle of nowhere.  If you expect newcomers to understand what the hell you're saying here, you need to develop your story-telling skills more.)'''

And here is where the trick bitchery starts. You see, it's all well and good for April to steal peoples' pics for all the world to laugh at. '''(And it is.)''' But don't you DARE take one of hers.

She will run to the ends of the earth to make you hide that shit.

The photo was stolen from my Facebook page before I removed it, and is now being hosted at Livejournal without consent. ****** is using the image to target me and my fiance, and to attempt to cause harm to my business.|April Winchell to LJAbuse}}

After receiving word of this article, April hastily sent a PM through [[livejournal]]'s message system. '''(The only thing I'm going to write in for this next part is that her response makes me swell with pride. Thank you for adding this part.)'''


{{quote|I would like to explain to you why I asked LiveJournal to remove the photo.

I took the photo off Facebook for a reason. It made people angry and hurt them. I may make snotty jokes about handcrafts, but it is never my intention to truly wound someone.

I filed the DMCA notice because this is serious to me. Maybe I should have just written to you in the first place, I don't know. I apologize if I handled this badly.

But please, stop posting it. It doesn't serve anyone. It doesn't open a dialogue, it doesn't educate anyone, and it doesn't make things better for the LGBT community. Just upsetting people isn't the same as activism.

Please, take down the Encyclopedia Dramatica entry. I have had a lifetime of fundraising and activism on behalf of my LGBT friends and family members, and I'm heartbroken to be portrayed as an enemy of that community.

I don't mind if people don't think my work is funny or don't like what I do. I understand that I'm not always going to hit it out of the park with everyone, and I accept that. I fail a lot at what I do. But this is not about that. This is about my trying to right a wrong, and I am humbly asking that you permit me to do so.

Respectfully,

April Winchell}}

And then she flounced from LJ altogether.  '''(Except that you can't flounce without an exit speech, and I don't see one here.  This looks like a letter asking for the removal of the photo.)'''
