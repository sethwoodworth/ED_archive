 (+GoddessMillenia) Oh May I add to the record?
 (@Pokchu) well technically
 (@Pokchu) you were banned after you blanked lots of pages
 (+xoxi) Pokchu i believe she is referring to her other accts
 (@januszeal) GoddessMillenia: everything you type is in the record
 (+GoddessMillenia) Ok
 (@januszeal) well everything you type in this channel
 (+GoddessMillenia) Well I would also like My Friend's pages edited
 (@Pokchu) oh ok. you were using another name then
 (+GoddessMillenia) Yes
 (+GoddessMillenia) I had two previous user names
 (@Pokchu) what were they
 (+GoddessMillenia) 'Violet' and 'Destiny'
 (@Pokchu) k
 (+xoxi) i would like to state for the record that my clients actions were in response to the page on her, and she therefore pleads temporary insanity by reason of the internet being srs bzns
 (+GoddessMillenia) The other posts were made by others who I was not aware had editted my page until they notified me about it
 (+GoddessMillenia) I would also like to state something else
 (@Pokchu) ok
 (+GoddessMillenia) Encyclopedia Dramatica is made to be funny right?
 (@Pokchu) well
 (@Pokchu) It's primary reason for existing is to document drama and lulz
 (@Pokchu) being funny is important though
 (+GoddessMillenia) Well a couple days back a User known as 'Crazy Dragon' editted the Legacy of Kain page and it was funny. It was in no way harassing another user either.
 • @Pokchu looks at it
 (+GoddessMillenia) It was funny! Many people who I knew thought so as well. However then Scarlet Carson reverted the Article back to hers.
 (@Pokchu) according to the history, all CDragon did was remove large chunks of the article, e.g. vandalism
 (+GoddessMillenia) She edited the page with her own humor
 (+GoddessMillenia) She didn't delete everything
 (@Pokchu) I know she didn't
 (@Pokchu) but she deleted a lot
 (+GoddessMillenia) Hmmm
 (@Pokchu) Usually you have to add something to be contributing your own humour
 (@Pokchu) hurrr
 (@januszeal) lol
 (+GoddessMillenia) Still 'Crazy Dragon' didn't harass any other users with her page. it was simply humor about the series itself.
 (+xoxi) may i have a minute to confer with my client?
 (@januszeal) GoddessMillenia: but its against the rules to delete huge sections of pages

 (@Pokchu) Truth
 (@Pokchu) If you're going to rewrite an article, you should actually REWRITE IT, instead of deleting half of it

 (+xoxi) may i please address the tribunal?
 (@Pokchu) Go ahead
 (+xoxi) in defense of my client, i first have to say, that she is unable to recognize lulz, a horrible and debilitating condition that she was unfortunately born with
 (+xoxi) seeing the page on herself set off this condition into a rage of temporary insanity, and caused her to do the horrific things mentioned in this tribunal
      —› quit: (emoskank) (emo@l0ld0ngs-7D16A8D7.twcny.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout)
 (+GoddessMillenia) Insert if I may?
 (@Pokchu) I see
 (@Pokchu) Go ahead
 (+xoxi) there is no excuse for such behavior, but my client has expressed a willingness to apologize, and throws herself on the mercy of the court - she does not ask for her ban from ED to be lifted, but rather that the page on her is blanked. she will then disappear from ED for good
 (@Pokchu) objection
 (@Pokchu) let GM speak for herself
 (+xoxi) kk
 (+GoddessMillenia) After the first discovery of my page
 (+GoddessMillenia) and pages on the others assciated with me
 (+GoddessMillenia) I and some other users did edit the article very minorly
 • @januszeal looks at history
 (+GoddessMillenia) And did not completely mass delete everything or huge sections
 (+GoddessMillenia) This part in the history goes way back
 (+GoddessMillenia) For instance
 (+GoddessMillenia) A few days ago I remember taking My Real name out of the aritcle because I felt it was unnecessay
 (+GoddessMillenia) However it was reverted by the Creator still
 (@Pokchu) I see
 (+GoddessMillenia) I would like to reinstate
      —› mode: (januszeal) sets mode (+v dr_g0sp)
 (+GoddessMillenia) I have had a total of 3 different UserNames on ED
 (@Pokchu) Okay.
 (+GoddessMillenia) In order they are:
 (+GoddessMillenia) 'Violet' 'Destiny' and finally 'NoOne'
 (+dr_g0sp) Gentlemen, I would like to speak on behalf of The State of Lulz.
 (+GoddessMillenia) (*Steps back*)
 (+GoddessMillenia) Go ahead
 (+dr_g0sp) With due respect to defendant's counsel
 (+dr_g0sp) I believe what we are seeing is a direct and coordinated pattern of behavior befitting a "sockpuppet" style disinformation campaign.
 (+dr_g0sp) And a personal war between defendant and a well-respected ED editor waged on the pages of this fair wiki.
 (+dr_g0sp) http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=User_talk:NoOne&diff=prev&oldid=1997212271
 (+dr_g0sp) This last edit prior to her temporary injunction on editing shows that she is acting with deliberation and direct disregard for the policies and persons of the website.
 (+GoddessMillenia) Hmmmmm
 (+dr_g0sp) I direct the attention of the Court to this language.
 (+dr_g0sp) Why don't you come try it pussy! Isn't that the whole point of the site anyways, like the disclaimers says, if you don't like it, don't be a pussy, and fuck off. I can edit what I want NoOne
 (+dr_g0sp) In addition it is not clear to myself that this individual is being completely open and honest about other alternate accounts, and she has not been willing to disclose any of the names of her conspirators.
 (@Pokchu) In regard to GM's comment on her talk page
 (+GoddessMillenia) True I did not appreciate how the ED was treating me and others
 (+dr_g0sp) This is behavior that is deliberate, open and obvious, in violation of clearly stated policies and in direct attack against other conspirators.
 (@Pokchu) Blanking articles is against policy, because it means deleting lulz.
 (+dr_g0sp) In behalf of The State of Lulz, I would like to recommend the maximum applicable punishment be levied against this individual, any alternate accounts she might currently have open, and any of her yet-to-be-discovered conspirators.
 (+dr_g0sp) Thank you.
 (+GoddessMillenia) I would like to state that I never used a 'SockPuppet'
 (+GoddessMillenia) or whatever
 (+GoddessMillenia) I made it clear who I was
 (@Pokchu) Yes
 (@Pokchu) I believe a sockpuppet is only a sockpuppet if the person claims to be someone else
 (@januszeal) yes
 (+GoddessMillenia) My behavior above was because The ED Admins were being predjuctice on what they allowed to remian in the articles and discussion pages
 (+xoxi) on behalf of the defendant, i restate my plea for mercy, and ask if information on co-conspirators could be used as part of a plea bargain
 (+dr_g0sp) With all due respect to the Tribunal, I would disagree. When I speak of a "sockpuppet" style campaign I mean a coordinated pattern of creating new accounts
 (@januszeal) having more then one account is not against the rules
 (+dr_g0sp) once a subsequent account has been banned for the same or similar behavior.
 (+dr_g0sp) In response to xoxi's plea upon the court, I respectfully submit that the Defendant is well aware of the behavior and actively working against lulz.
 (+GoddessMillenia) My actions today were a bulid up of being constantly banned for not only deleting but simple edits to my article
 (+dr_g0sp) I would call upon the Defendant to produce one iota of evidence of said "simple edit".
 (+GoddessMillenia) See above
 (+dr_g0sp) http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Special:Contributions/NoOne
 (+dr_g0sp) http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Special:Contributions/Destiny
 (+dr_g0sp) http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Special:Contributions/Violet
 (+GoddessMillenia) Ah but notice
 (+dr_g0sp) I call upon you to produce one iota of evidence out of the links that I have generously provided for you.
 (+xoxi) would it be possible to reach a compromise - in that the defendant's real name and pictures be removed from the article? i fail to see any grave effect on the lulz by doing so
 (+GoddessMillenia) I only retaliated by Blanking after the Admins banned me for Scarlet Carson editing my post making it appear like I said 'You're Mother's A whore'
 (+dr_g0sp) And which account was this with, Defendant?
 (+GoddessMillenia) Violet
 (+GoddessMillenia) Check the bottom of the History page
 (+dr_g0sp) I see no blankings
