LOL PENIS
During the quiet night of 8/15/08, a number of users calling themselves the [[Fags|Holegans]] in the [[Fur Affinity]] forums decided they'd had enough of the [[furries]] and their bullshit. [[Some argue]] that they did it out of anger of FA's shitty [[so-called]] Admins refusing to answer valid questions by the community. Regardless, these "Holegans" united under the phrase "[[LOL]] [[PENIS]]" and began making numerous threads of the topic, using said Phrase.

== The Build-Up ==
It all began when some member named [[newfag|Rilvor]] made 2 threads complaining about how the forums is not your [[LiveJournal]] or [[shit nobody cares about|some other shit]]. The [[fags|mods]] then became [[butthurt]] and [[baw|BAWWWWW'd]] about how they are understaffed and overworked even though they don't moderate shit. The Holegans then made plans in their [[shit|IRC]] to raid the forums with [[unfunny|FUNNYLOL]] image macros of 9/11 and [[bestiality|dogs]].

== First Strike ==

At around 2 am EST, one brave Holegan made a thread of the name "LOL PENIS" in FA's [[Shit|Rants and Raves]] section, in mockery of a suggestion posted by another user in the thread [[some argue]] started all of this. Holegans quickly united and began spamming text in massive font, image macros (WHICH ARE NOT ALLOWED ON FA FORUMS OMG), and random nonsense related to the phrase or containing "LOL PENIS". Another common posting was "POST COUNT + 1", relating to the forum [[whores]] who sit around in forum games all day posting to increase the size of their [[e-peen]] due to furries' lack of self esteem (A giant postcount makes them feel somehow less worthless).

== Second Strike ==

[[Image:LOL PENIS2.jpg|thumb|120px|LOL SOME MORE PENIS]]
[[Image:Holeganbelair.jpg|thumb|120px|If anything he could see moderation was rare...]]
Like crabs on the crotch of a two-dollar whore, the LOL PENIS threads began spreading until most of the forum sections were dominated by a LOL PENIS thread, with Holegans making new threads faster than the 1 [[bitch|moderator]] could delete them. Non-Holegans attempting to become [[cool|TEH KEWL]] tried to join in by posting idiocy in the threads, only to be chased out by the Holegans. As the [[lulz]] in the IRC began to slow, so did the Holegans assault. Around 4 AM, the Holegans relented to plan out the next strike.

== MODS=FAGS ==
<s>You'd think they'd do that, instead they act worse than the people they complain about then wonder "bawww we got in trouble"...</s>[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS]]. -Arshes Nei

[[bitch|Admin]] [[Retard|Dave Hyena]] proceeded to [[banhammer]] all of the Holegans who posted in the LOL PENIS thread after one Holegan commented "We all knew quite well what we were doing, I personally laughed for 2 hours straight."

In the end, nothing of value was lost.

== The Thread ==

<s>The original LOL PENIS thread can be found here. [http://forums.furaffinity.net/showthread.php?t=25240]</s>
LOL DISREGARD THAT, THE ADMINS DELETED IT
== Strike Three ==
It has been made. Coming soon.

== Holegan Manifesto ==
'''We Holegans are always here. We may be lurking in the shadows, unseen in our true colors, but we are Holegans no less, here and ready to fight off the Baaw when it rears its ugly head.'''

== Butthurt Admin ==
The following conversation took place between a banned Holegan and a [[Butthurt]] [[lesbian|Admin]]:

'''The Banned''' (8:24:36 PM): If you do not mind, I would like to dicuss why my 7 day ban has suddenly become permanent?

'''te arshes nei''' (8:25:37 PM): I believe the reason is on your ban.

'''The Banned''' (8:26:05 PM): You have been banned for the following reason:
Since it doesn't seem that a week is enough to you, your ban is now indefinite. There will be no time frame when this ban is lifted. Take care.
Date the ban will be lifted: Never

'''The Banned''' (8:26:10 PM): Not at all, actually.

'''te arshes nei''' (8:28:03 PM): Here's a question for you. Why are you upset?

'''The Banned''' (8:28:38 PM): You assume things too much my dear. Now, your question has been answered, so I will ask you once again to answer mine.

'''te arshes nei''' (8:28:57 PM): you're asking about it, seems a week didn't bother you. So obviously this upsets you.

'''The Banned''' (8:29:40 PM): I am curious in persuing a reason for actions. Am I to assume a rogue admin took the arbritrary liberty of banning me due to a grudge?

'''te arshes nei''' (8:30:22 PM): It has nothing to do with Rogue adminning at all

'''te arshes nei''' (8:30:26 PM): you found a week hilarious

'''te arshes nei''' (8:30:31 PM): now it's indefinite

'''te arshes nei''' (8:30:38 PM): maybe that's something to think about before you push the issue

'''te arshes nei''' (8:31:20 PM): " Originally Posted by Shark_the_raptor Actually, he thought it was hilarious that he got banned for a week."

'''The Banned''' (8:31:25 PM): So, let's recap. Another speaks on how I feel of the issue. So, a rogue admin decides that I am not allowed to laugh at such things, and takes further action that is not against any rules.

'''The Banned''' (8:31:37 PM): That sounds like an arbitrary action with no basis to me.

'''te arshes nei''' (8:31:42 PM): more like it sounds like you don't care about the punishment

'''te arshes nei''' (8:31:49 PM): this one gives you one to think about, better consequences.

'''te arshes nei''' (8:31:58 PM): should have thought of that before huh?

'''The Banned''' (8:32:12 PM): So, to further cap. A rogue admin decides to take actions with no basis in rules or discussion

'''The Banned''' (8:33:07 PM): I somehow do not recall it being that an admin were to use their power to enact on their personal grudges against others, or to remove a personality they do not like personally.

'''te arshes nei''' (8:33:15 PM): you're repeating yourself and not reading what happened. But that's ok, keep convincing yourself it was something else

'''The Banned''' (8:33:44 PM): I am quite aware of what has happened. Nameless admin has taken an arbitrary action with no solid basis.

'''te arshes nei''' (8:33:44 PM): you intentionally trolled the forums, now you got really good consequences to deal with, not just "Well at most they'll banz me for a week lolololz"

'''te arshes nei''' (8:34:04 PM): solid enough. Take care. No more arguments will convince the staff otherwise.

'''The Banned''' (8:34:34 PM): Somehow I think there were at most two admins dicussing this. But, as a great novelist wrote "Go then. There are other worlds than these"

'''te arshes nei''' (8:35:04 PM): keep guessing keep typing like I said, you hit the end of the line here.

'''te arshes nei''' (8:35:14 PM): Have a great summer. But I hear school is starting up.

'''The Banned''' (8:35:23 PM): I will however, be informing the site owner of arbitrary actions taken with little to no basis. Have a nice night.

'''te arshes nei''' (8:35:50 PM): not really but again, have a nice night.
