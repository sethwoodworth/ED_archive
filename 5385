Former [[fatty]] Mike Huckabee is a [[batshit insane]] [[Baptist]] Preacher and governor of [[Arkansas]] who ran for the [[Republican]] ticket for the presidential race of 2008.  He is also working closely in cahoots with [[Chuck Norris]].

In a moment of pure genius, [[Fox News|FOX]] greenlit giving Mike his own [[Oprah]]-like [[television]] show. The show features a town-hall segment where Mike gets the opinions of average [[Americans]] about how they want to play out the American fantasy and is comprised of [[niggers]] begging for [[slavery]] and [[fat]] people complaining about [[shit nobody cares about|food]].


== I’m a Hunter.  Not a Fighter. ==
[[Image:Huckabee08 Batshit Insane.gif‎|thumb|right|Rejected Campaign Bumper Sticker''.]]
Huckabee has been seen in the media as a complete and total [[dumbass]]. Like most [[Attention whore|politicians]], he feels this is a good sign for him because it means that he is a [[pretty cool guy|viable candidate]]. Unlike most [[Attention whore|politicians]], he is seen as being [[Idiot|dumb as a bag of bricks]] causing [[fail]] and epic [[lulz]]. A late entrant to the [[Republican]] race, Huckabee only came in as a double [[fucktard]], having been pulled out of the hat to get votes by stealing selected policies from [[Ron Paul]] without stating his own real point: he [[hate]]s [[Catholics]] almost as much as [[Mormon]]s and the [[ZOG]] needed him for that reason.

== Areas of Expertise ==
=== The AIDS ===
[[Image:Huckabee-questionaire-3.jpg|thumb ]]
Huckabee has earned the support of many [[Nigra|african-americans]] by suggesting in the early 90s that [[AIDS]] patients should be quarantined to keep it from spreading. This position got many public pools in Arkansas closed, angering the [[butthurt]]s at [[Habbo]]. 

In 1992 Huckabee filled out a [[TL;DR|229 questionnaire]] where he promptly made it into his own old media blog/manifesto by [[Pwnt|bitch slapping the shit]] out of Elizabeth Taylor and [[Madonna]] by saying they should [[GTFO|come up with the money themselves]] for The Gay Plague.  He also recommended that anyone who even remotely looked like they might have a lesion be quarantined, causing Brooke Shields to hide her mole in terror.

Unfortunately for him this was 1992, where everyone with a working brain stem and a copy of [[Old media|Time Magazine]] knew that [[AIDS|The Gay Plague]] was not an airborne disease. [[Bullshit|This fine manuscript]] laid dormant for [[At least 100 years ago|at least hundred years]] until someone [[Google|with unlimited time]] found it December of 2007:

{{quote|Medical protocol typically says that if you have a disease for which there is no cure, and you are uncertain about the transmission of it, then the first thing you do is that you quarantine or isolate carriers.|Mike Huckabee – Stupid is as stupid does since 1985.}}

{{quote|If I were making those same comments today, I might make them a little differently.|Mike Huckabee.  Forgetting to say that Madonna's music stunk in 1992.}}

While this strategy is surely great for fighting the ever inevitable [[zombie]] outbreak, the only way to fight [[aids]] is to use a condom, or if you are a christfag burn in hell for being naughty.

===[[Necrophilia]]===
Mike Huckabee is the only potential candidate in the 2008 presidential election to have a stated position on the hot-button issue of necrophilia.
{{quote|It is now difficult to keep track of the vast array of '''publicly endorsed''' and '''institutionally supported''' aberrations—from homosexuality and pedophilia to sadomasochism and '''necrophilia'''.|[http://www.motherjones.com/washington_dispatch/2007/12/huckabee-homosexuality-environmentalism-book.html The Huckster]}}
=== [[Terrorist|Foreigners]] ===
[[Image:Huckabee Rambo.jpg|thumb|kicking ass in Iraq.  Once he finds it on the map.]]

'''December:''' When questioned about an [[Oxymoron|intelligence report]] in [[Iran]] that was all over the news, blogs, and tattooed on the ass of [[Condoleezza Rice|Condi Rice]] for the world to see, Mike Huckabee seems to have missed it.

{{quote|It would have been nice had someone been able to first say, 'here's some things that are going on, that are taking place,'" "That didn't happen...|Mike Huckabee.  [[Cycle of Blame|Throwing his Staff under the bus]] .}}

=== More like Latter-Day Ain't Really Christians Amirite? ===

[[Image:Gay Jesus and Satan.jpg|thumb|Huckabee on Mormons.]]
'''I know nothing about no other [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/12/politics/main3612914.shtml religion]'''

'''December 12 2007''' Huckabee, a Baptist Minister, who has close and personal relationship with [[Allah|god]], asked [[CNN]] if Mormons believe [[Al Gore|Jesus]] and the [[George Bush|devil]] are brothers [[Stupid|because he had no idea]] and was afraid to ask his staff, as they were still busy researching exactly where Iran fell on the Map. He thought it would never be quoted, but CNN has finally figured out a good lulz when they see one. (NOTE: YES MORMONS BELIEVE THIS)

{{quote|attacking someone's religion is really going too far.|Huckabee.  Pwn’d going too far.}}

=== The Constitution ===
[http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/01/15/579265.aspx '''January 15, 2008''' ]  [[God]] is talking to Huck again on the campaign trail. This time as a co-editor for the Constitution:
 
{{quote|(Some of my opponents) do not want to change the Constitution, but I believe it's a lot easier to change the constitution than it would be to change the word of the living God, and that's what we need to do is to amend the Constitution so it's in God's standards rather than try to change God's standards,.|Huckabee.  Fuck, he's nuts!}}

=== Huckabee as [[Anonymous|Lulz Killer]] ===

As if anyone would even know who the fuck Bob Newhart is, Huckabee has taken to doing wacky [[unfunny|comedy bits]] on his [[Cell Phone]] causing unlulzy fail.
As clearly evidenced by the fact that there is no ED article for fucking [http://www.bobnewhart.com/ Bob Newhart].

== Mike Huckabee presidential campaign, 2008 ==
=== Endorsements ===

[[Image:Wha mah-Fingas Huckabee.jpg|thumb|Fingering Christian soldiers.]]
He got the call from [[Chuck Norris]], thereby classifying his entire candidacy as [[old meme]].  Fortunately, Huckabee's [[The Colbert Report|fart jokes]] appeal to a segment of the population broadly overlapping with Chuck Norris Fact enthusiasts. This is ironic, considering that while Huckabee has the guy who stared in "Missing in Action," [[John McCain]] actually WAS fucking missing in action.

Norris, who has been punched in the face too often, seems to have missed Huckabee's political record completely and threw out this [[oxymoron]] on his BBQ & Hog Fucking Party Website:

{{quote|While he is '''a man of great political accomplishments''', he is cut from a different cloth. He is '''not a Washington political insider'''.|Norris. Old Meme. Crazy Dumbass.}}

Let the record show that having [[Chuck Norris]] in your camp is like having [[Ron Jeremy]] throw you a BBQ.  It is cool for a second and you might even have [[sex]] with a [[16-year-old girl|porn star.]] Then you just want the [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|crazy to go home]].

===The Iowa Caucus===
On January 3rd, 2008, Huckabee won the Iowa Caucus. This just proves that half the [[fag|voters]] in Iowa are afraid of getting the shit kicked out of them by Chuck Norris and/or [[God|Gawd]]. The other half are too afraid to *not* vote for either [[dyke|Hillary]] or black person.

===The New Hampshire Primary===
Mike asked Rudy Giuliani if he voted for him. <br><br>
He was stunned to find out that the former New York mayor was not a registered voter in New Hampshire.
