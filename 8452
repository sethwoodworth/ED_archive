'''TolstoyKafkaEvsky''' is a [[typical]] [[Jewtube]] fag who tries to make edgy, yet [[fail|informative]], videos about games and consoles that he's never played. His [[lie|hilarious]] and [[ADHD|hyperactive]] style of humor has earned him a [[over 9000]] subscribers, mostly of the [[13 year old boy]] demographic who think gaming is [[serious business]]. Tolstoykafkaevsky miraculously has maintained a loyal [[fanbase]], despite his many attempts of leaving Youtube because the creators [[Obvious|only care about the money]]. He also has had a [[Shit Nobody Cares About|blog]], [[Wut?|forum]], and a [[LiveVideo]] channel.


== How it all began ==

[[2007|In the beginning]], TolstoyKafkaEvsky's channel used to be somewhat bearable. It presented an array of somewhat informative videos about [[Retro Video Game Kids|retro consoles]] and [[Crap|cheap, Chinese knock-off toys.]] Afraid to show his identity ([[butterface|yeah, right]]), he only showed his torso in his early videos. It was obvious early on that he was a douche because of his "The Who" and [[Boondocks|"Boondocks"]] shirts. Another thing that was [[rage|fucking annoying]] was when he filmed himself playing the console. Instead of using screen capture like every other respectable human fucking being, he just[[fail| recorded the screen with his shitty camera]] that he always bitched about running out of batteries. Tolstoy was also notable for making videos about [[Shit Nobody Cares About|himself and his personal life]], like his Thanksgiving and Halloween specials about his [[White People|unremarkable Amerikkkunt family]]. 

When Tolstoykafkaevsky showed his face for the first time in his EyeToy review, the channel started to turn into [[jumped the shark|even more of a pile of shit]]. He realized that since he attracted a respectable [[nerds|fanbase]], he could now express his [[faggotry]] through videos about things like [[politics]], [[religion]], and [[Serious Business|Youtube]]. Immediately his videos morphed into a big pile of severed donkey dicks, as he then started talking about airsoft guns and his sexual lust towards C.S. Lewis. 

Even though it seemed it couldn't get worse... it did. Tolstoy stated to delve into his [[anarchist]], [[communist|pinko]], [[bullshit]] beliefs. Like every other [[Dumb|Generation Y]]-er on the planet, he [[truth|criticized the policies of every fucking politician with blatant straw man arguments]]. Recently, he has been an advocate for universal healthcare, claiming that he is too poor and can't afford it, despite the fact that [[You|he's 21, unemployed, and lives with both of his parents]].


== The Fail ==

At a certain point of Tolstoy's self-described [[LOL|"fame"]], he started to get all [[Niggers|uppity]]. Declaring that Youtube was the [[Serious Business|root of all evil]], he migrated to LiveVideo, and phailed to an [[epic fail|epik degree]]. [[Shit nobody cares about|Nobody gave a shat]] about his new videos nor the point he was trying to get across. Even his buttbuddy, [http://www.youtube.com/user/crammage "Crammage"], called him a douche and [[Ouch|told him to fuck off]]. In the end, Tolstoy admitted that he didn't know what the fuck he was thinking and moved back to Jewtube. It was too late, however, he had reached a new level of shitness. Instead actually posting videos about video games, Tolstoy started to [[clusterfuck]] his channel with videos about airsoft guns, [[furry|stuffed animals]], and overall, [[shit nobody cares about]].

== ''What I Believe'' Series ==

In an attempt to surpass his already record-breaking level of douchery, TolstoyKafkaEvsky created a series where he talked about his religious views. It was an undeniable straw man factory consisting of four episodes, and a response video containing [[bawww]]. In it, he claimed that atheists are [[Irony|ridiculous piles of shit]] while he paced around his living room without a shirt on. TolstoyKafkaEvsky also claimed that you were wrong because [[Virgin|he knows more about world theology than you do]].
