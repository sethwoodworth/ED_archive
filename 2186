Demon
[[Image:Demon.jpg|thumb|right|It is a well-known [[fact]] that all [[Insane Clown Posse|clowns]] and [[cunt|women]] are daemons.]]
'''Daemons''' are supernatural servants of [[Satan]]. Contrary to [[popular belief]], they are not imaginary but among us, waging a battle for the souls of humanity. Daemons manifest on the fingertips of [[internets]] users, forcing them to sound [[crazy]], spell badly and render shoddy artwork. [[Blog]]gers have one of three relationships with daemons.

===Studies Daemons===
*[http://community.livejournal.com/0therkin_ny A request for information]:
**"In the research phase for writing a book on [[otherkin]]. Please consider taking a moment to answer these basic questions. All questions are optional and please do not attach your name." (See Also [[Gullible]])
*[http://community.livejournal.com/0therkin_ny/5636.html tulgey_wood]: 
**"I'm not an "[[otherkin]]" or what you want to call yourselves. I'm simply here because i happened to meet someone from i think another plane of existence. I'm not sure. Communication is somewhat limited. She's been known to be able to possess people and communicate that way. She's also known to [[hack]] into my e-mail/[[LiveJournal]]. I feel that this would be a good way for her to make [[friend]]s." (See Also [[Insane]])

=== Battles Daemons ===
*[http://drug-disaster.livejournal.com/9217.html drug_disaster]: 
**"I go blind and [[stupid]], and there's a [[vampire]] killing a 6 year old girl while channeling my essence, using my third eye, so that I can see it, liking blood off his fingers, me shouting him to leave me alone because he is creating bad reputation and survival threat to every vamp that is living in Melbourne physically."   (See also [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]])

**"Is Bill Clinton demonically possessed?  Of course, he is, as we clearly show in the above mentioned articles.  Remember this about anyone involved in Satanism; they want to be possessed by as many demons as possible, because each demon they invite into their souls gives them more power and usually, specific gifts.  To an occultist, it is no big deal to be called demonically possessed, within their circle.  Of course, a politician will deny it, because of the terrible connotation it carries with the electorate." (See Also [[Conservative]] [[Fundamentalist]])
*[http://castlecops.com/postt71476.html Reverend Jim Peasboro]:
**"The minister estimates that [[Statistics|one in 10 computers]] in America now houses some type of evil spirit. Rev. Peasboro advises that if you suspect your computer is possessed, you consult a clergyman or, if the computer is still under warranty, take it in for servicing."  (See Also [[Alabama]])

**"My soul has taken many forms since its intial creation but I will always be what I was first. I'm a Vanaesca Draikhan'shin more simply a dragoness of the void..." (See also [[Wackjob]])
*[http://www.xanga.com/karania karania]:
