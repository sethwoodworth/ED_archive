Lordwiggles
{{crapstub}}
From around 2002 until [[at least 100 years ago|2006]], the official forums of a fantasy-themed browsergame known as [[faggot|Kings of Chaos]] were trolled by a group calling themselves [[shit nobody cares about|Chaos Tribe]].  Although he was a complete and utter newb when he found them, a user gong by the monicker of LordWiggles proved to be a ruthless and effective troll and was quickly welcomed into Chaos Tribe.  This was, of course, back when trolling was actually mean-spirited [[baw|and the unfunny adverse reactions were well deserved.]]

== Achievements ==

*After trolling in Chaos Tribe for only a short time, Wiggles's ferocious douchebaggery earned him the title of [[unwarranted self-importance|King]] amongst his fellow chaos tribe trolls.

*Upon discovering that another user's parents had died recently, Wiggles flamed her so harshly under about a dozen different usernames that she [[baw|blanked her account and disappeared from the forum.]]  It was speculated that she [[shit nobody cares about|killed herself]].

*Wiggles joined another fantasy-themed forum, and was immediately banned mere minutes after account creation.  Quoth the moderator; "We don't do that here."

*Wiggles once acquired an admin password and banned all of the Moderators of Chaos, unbanning notorious troller accounts at the same time.  [[all your base are belong to us|After ruling over the entire Kingdom of Chaos for about a week]], [[for great justice|the server was blanked so that all accounts were reset and the forums were rebuilt completely by their original owners.]]

== Where is he now? ==

In 2006, the real LordWiggles [[unwarranted self-importance|grew a conscience]] and [[baw|guilt tripped]] his fellow Chaos Tribe trolls before disappearing, never to be seen on the internet again.  While the name has resurfaced from time to time, these are presumably [[faggot|posers]] who want to ride the coat tails of an established name in trolling, or old Chaos Tribers who miss their king.  The [[internet|world]] will probably never see LordWiggles or his special brand of douchebaggery again, he has taken his place as a forgotten legend in [[at least 100 years ago|internet history]].
