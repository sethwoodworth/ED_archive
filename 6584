Predictive Analysis Software
{{more|images}}
'''Predictive Analysis Software''' (or '''PAS''') is [[Corporate America]]'s new toy to [[rape]] [[you|people]] [[unemployed|looking for work]] so that the company they are applying to work for can find some lame excuse to hire some [[China|Chinese]] or [[Mexico|Mexican]] to do a job for less than minimum wage.

PAS does a [[goatse|deep search]] to dig up any [[lulz]] you have ever posted on the Internet, especially at social networking sites such as [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], and [[Twitter]] to determine things that haven't happened yet.

PAS is [[serious business]], [[anti-lulz]] and [[The cancer|the cancer that is killing just about everything]] rolled up into one package.

== What PAS looks for ==
PAS uses [[math|algorithms]] based on [[bullshit|statistical analysis]] to calculate various coefficients and variables to determine information that really does not describe [[Sick fuck|what kind of person you really are]].

Where as any [[NORP|normal]] job interview will just look at your [[resume]], your [[dox]], your references, your credit report, and whether or not you've committed any felonies or touched any little boys, PAS goes [[Batshit insane|completely overboard]] and looks at your posting habits, your social networking habits, and other crap that really is none of their goddamn business especially if you did not use social networking at work or if your school is run by Orwellian faggots who won't let you use GMail because you have it set up to use HTTPS.

PAS looks at frivolous crap like:
* "Antisocial behavior"
* How many girlfriends/boyfriends you have ever been in a relationship with.
* Political affiliation. (Most businesses won't hire [[liberals]], unless you plan on working at [[Trader Joes]], you dirty hippie!)
* Whether or not you're a Jew or [[terrorist|Muslim]].
* Whether or not you're white.
* Whether or not you're a woman.
* Whether or not you're a gay or fag-enabler.
* How many times a week that you [[fap]].
* How many slutty photos of yourself you've posted on the Internet. (If you have, [[Geek Squad|they will add it to their porn collection]].
* How many registered sex offenders are on your friends list or following you.
* How much [[loli]] is on the thumbdrive hidden in your sock drawer.
* What your underwear smells like.
* How many times you stop by Wal-mart each week to buy lotion and kleenex.

== What PAS can predict ==
PAS enables foolish corporate scum to assume the position of God as they think they can predict the future like it was the weather.  However, the future is not set in stone.  Things can change.  And like any form of statistical analysis [[psychic|cold reading]], it only serves to do more harm that good.

Despite all of that, the people who use PAS assume they can predict the following events:
* That you will quit and find a better job.
* How many twinkles you will buy next week.
* When you will die.
* When you will get fired.
* When you will show up for work one day and fucking kill everyone.
* When you will become [[an hero]].

== What else PAS can do ==
* Steal your girlfriend's panties.
* Tell everyone what a sick fuck you are.
* Help you move back into [[your mom]]'s house.
* Help you become a [[basement dweller]].
* Help you become [[an hero]].

== What PAS can't do ==
* Predict the future. (I mean, following people around like tagged animals and making vague assumptions about people is pointless if you don't fit the mold.  Of course, the PASfags have a [[final solution]] for that.)

* [[Ceiling Cat]]
* [[Andrew Shirvell]]
* [[The Google]]
* [[Walmart]]
* [[Psychic|Psychics]]
* Con-artists
