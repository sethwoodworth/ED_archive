'''Orson Welles''' began the age of modern trolling [[at least 100 years ago]].  He is famous for many [[IRL]] trolls that have yet to be matched by anyone since.

==Most Famous Trolls==

* Welles [[pwned]] America by broadcasting a fake news broadcast called the "War of The Worlds", fooling everyone into thinking that the planet was being invaded by Gorillasexuals.  After being confronted by the [[Internet Police]], Welles was reported to have shouted  [[troll|"Trolled!"]] and ran away cackling.  In later interviews, Welles would claim that he "did it for the [[lulz]]."

* Welles also pwned both a really fucking rich guy named Hearst and the American public by creating his trolling magnum opus: "Citizen Kane".  In a nutshell, [[Pain | Citizen Kane]] is bad [[fanfiction]] about Hearst but with the names changed.  It's also the most [[boring]] [[movie]] that has ever existed.  The world is full of losers (like [[your mom]]) who try to seem cultured by insisting that this movie is great, even though watching the movie makes you want to become [[an hero]].  When such a loser finds a [[victim]] who doesn't like Citizen Kane, the loser will act all shocked and whine about it until the victim agrees that Citizen Kane is the best movie ever made.  Thus, the world is full of people who insist to each other that this movie is great when in fact [[you don't have any friends | nobody likes it at all]].

* Throughout the late 70's and early 80's, Welles' pwned [[Alcohol|Paul Masson]] out $1,786,809,937.00 worth of stock of their shitty wine by doing 789 takes in their big budgeted (reported at $500,000,000 in todays money) wine commercials. 

* Welles' final troll was to pwn [[emo|whiny]] [[Transformers]] [[fanboys]] by calling Transformers a show where "two groups of toys do awful things to each other".  [[Srsly]].

==Famous Quotes==

* "MMMMMMMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH........THE FRENCH!!!!"
