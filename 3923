'''I don't think you have an X. Enjoy your Y.''', also frequently appearing in the form '''Enjoy your AIDS''', is another form of [[chan]]speak which seems to have surfaced on various chans recently, and being a textual [[meme]] it has no [[pix plz|visual]] representation. Due to the growing [[cynicism]] and skepticism on various chans like [[420chan]] and [[Britchan]], this meme basically asserts that the poster who has said something good about his life is just making shit up, because it is thought that people who post on chan boards must automatically have [[no life]] by default.

==Examples==
*I don't think you have any friends. Enjoy your [[suicide]]
*I don't think you have a [[girlfriend]]. Enjoy your [[fap|hand]].
*I don't think you have a [[fap|hand]]. Enjoy your [[Pirate|hook]].
*I don't think you have a [[NORP|job]]. Enjoy your parents' [[basement dweller|basement]].
*I don't think you have a [[vagina]]. Enjoy your small [[penis]].
*I don't think you have a [[fap|hand]]. Enjoy your [[girlfriend]].
*I don't think you have an existence. Enjoy your [[time paradox|paradox]].
*I don't think you have a [[your mom |mom]]. Enjoy your [[dad]].
*I don't think you have a [[girlfriend]]. Enjoy your [[manboobs]].

==Scepticism and Cynicism==
Channers are regularly cynical of the others' achievements in life, almost [[paranoid]] about it and are in [[denial]] that other channers might actually be getting laid IRL and not lying about it. This is to make up for the [[butthurt|insecurity]] of those who say '''I don't think you have an X. Enjoy your Y.''' because people who say this are the ones who sit around at their [[desktop]] alone all day only entertaining themselves through [[pizza]], [[booze]], [[weed]] and [[pr0n]] due to their complete and utter [[failure]] to make anything of themselves IRL.

==Other Variations==
This meme also appears regularly in its second and more powerful form, denoted by the equation "I don't believe you have an X, enjoy your Y". This is most frequently used by grammarfags and people who think they sound smarter using it this way, despite the fact that it simply replaces the word 'think' with 'believe'.
