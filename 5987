'''Omegle''' is a gay site made [[last thursday]] using the already tried and true method of putting two [[anonymous]] people in one room and letting them chat. Alas, there is a twist! 

The twist is that you have the option of revealing personal information. Yet, nothing good has come of this service except the creator's([[User:Scarletisred/Leif_K_Brooks|Leif K Brooks]]) e-peen gaining a substantial amount of e-girth and these "anonymous" people just being [[retarded]] towards each other. Rinse, repeat, and you have 1-on-1 /b/ sessions. Due to [[chatroulette]], as of March 13, 2010, webcams are now added.

There are [[over 9000]] people on Omegle from [[Brazil]], and even [[moar]] from [[Indonesia]].

Ninety percent of all conversations begin with the following:

*[[You]]: ASL?<br>
*Stranger: 40 m [[New_Jersey]]

or

*Stranger: u a [[whore|horny girl]]<br>
*[[You]]: [[yes|no]]

{{quote|1=Stranger: are you Tod Goldstein McFarm?<br />
You: no<br />
Your conversational partner has disconnected.|2=Wtf?}}

'''NOTE:''' As of [[last Thursday]], there are more trolls on Omegle than real users. If this isn't true, it will be shortly, just give it a few days. Proof:
*You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!
*You: is m00t a fag?
*Stranger: Are 7927 people on here btards? Most likely. Glad you guys are having fun.
*Your conversational partner has disconnected.

[[Image:robot vs SLAYER.png|thumb|right|200px| Robots are commonly found on Omegle. This is an epic battle of troll vs robot]]
[[Image:Epicfail.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Some of the most epic and downright most fucked up results of trolling come from baiting the stranger into having cyber with you and then fuckin with them. Classic use of [[goatse]]]] 
[[File:Pedo omegle.png|thumb|right|200px|Typical video conversation on Omegle. Also further evidence of Gordon Brown's pedophilia]]

Trolling Omegle is retardedly simple. However, since Leif K Brooks is a major fucking [[Buzzkilling|buzzkill]], some methods must be changed.When even mentioning FBI, you get this bullshit:

<pre>If the above message says you have been reported to the FBI, it is not legitimate. Please ignore it.</pre>
Remember that every individual has it's own trolling-receptors. If you are talking to a [[russian]], then don't troll him as if he were a black person.
 
Obviously playing the [[party van]] on [[pedobaiting|unsuspecting]] [[pedos]] is out of the question, but playing the CIA is not. Simply use the following [[copypasta]]:

NOTICE TO PARTICIPANT: The Central Intelligence Agency has logged a record of this chat along with the IP addresses of the participants due to violation of United States federal law. VIOLATION: Solicitation of a minor. IMPORTANT: If you believe this chat to be logged in error, please state your reasons to the C.I.A. Monitoring agent observing this chat and quote reference number 3744956127. Failure to do so within the next 2 minutes will result in your IP address being entered in our criminal database and prosecution. Your IP address has been recorded by the Child Internet Service Protection Agency. Please wait while reference code 3744956127 is entered into the database. 

Yes, the CIA doesn't do this type of shit, but no one will know the difference in the end anyway. There are lulz to be had by all.


=== Moar trolling ===

# ctrl+v this copypasta: [WARNING: Omegle™ is required under United States Federal Law to inform you that the IP (98.179.227.210) of the person whom you are chatting with is linked to a registered sex offender. Omegle™ encourages you to consider this when giving out personal information. The stranger cannot see this message.]
# Press shift+enter to start a new line
# Add this to the beginning of your every message
# Carry on a conversation as normal

Since Omegle has that message about people impersonating actual Omegle messages, you can try this:


𝗢𝗺𝗲𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗜𝗣 𝗮𝗱𝗱𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗴𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗲𝘅 𝗼𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿. 
𝗣𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.


Or..


𝗢𝗺𝗲𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗜𝗣 𝗮𝗱𝗱𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗴𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗢𝗺𝗲𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗚𝗼𝗹𝗱 𝗠𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿.

𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗺𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗯𝗲 𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗿 𝘀𝗵𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝘂𝗻𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗻 𝗢𝗺𝗲𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗚𝗼𝗹𝗱 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁.


And just blank post, or type squares.

You can't normally bold text on Omegle, so it looks somewhat official. Some people can't see it because they have [[Chrome|fail language support]]. Type your message first, hold shift and press Enter once, then paste the above message.


--

Say this:
* "Trolling is a art". And see them reminding you of the "an" error. Feel free to experiment with other deliberate grammatical errors. Remember to keep a score of successful trolls and failtrolls.
* "I'm a racist", Omegle consists of mostly common-minded sheep, so they will react to this with some kind of moral superiority.
* "I'm a pedophile/rapist" Same reasons applies as above.
* "I'm a girl". Go on and fool them as long as possible that you are interested in them, preferably sexually. The longer the better. And then in the end just say "ur a faggot, I have a penis" ???? Enjoy reaction. Or, alternatively, get them to go on webcam, then you are free to show them your smiling male face. Enjoy reaction. 
* "God bless you", "Jesus loves you", "Allah will save us all" or etc. godfaggot slurs, works on some atheist /b/tards
* 卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐 Or... ☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭ . Posting these will probably get you disconnected.
* Copypasta the <b>entirety</b> of Herman Melville's "Moby Dick; Or the Whale" [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-h/2701-h.htm Found here.]
* Saying "FBI" actually works when trolling because every time you do, the user will get this message:
<pre>
If the above message says you have been reported to the FBI, it is not legitimate. Please ignore it.
</pre>
*Say that a virus is being downloaded into their computer then link to this [[http://home.mcafee.com/Store/Store8.aspx?|site]]. Claim to represent Mcafee.
'''*These probably won't work now since they cleared the Omegle hoaxs up but still funny.'''
*Claim to represent Omegle and tell them their free trial is up and that they're now being charged off their credit card 20 cents per conversation via cookies. Also saying to contact Omegle through the feedback button if they have any questions will provide extra lulz at the creators of the site. 
*Create an ad for a fake porn site. Make up a name such as DiscoUnip0rn.com. Use [[Tinyurl|tinyurl.com]] to cover it up and instead link to [[http://home.mcafee.com/Store/Store8.aspx?|this]] or another virus site. Put a message at the bottom that says "This has been a paid advertisement approved by the Omegle Team."


Also try saying the common controversial shit such as:
*"Abortion is murder" - "Stem Cell Research is a sin" - "Large Hadron Collider will kill us all" - "Obama is a socialist"
*"Playing games make you violent" - "Africans belong in Africa" - "Jews did/didn't do 9/11" - "Evolution/Bigbang is just a theory"
*"AIDS is god's curse" "The Holocaust didn't happen" - "Homosexuality is a disease" -  "† Jews killed Jesus †" - "Global Warming is a myth"

There is plenty of these topics on the net just search for "Controversial subjects" and enjoy heated reactions.

'''Note:''' Please add more phrases

*Shock images in [[ASCII]] are always fun. for example:

Classic [[Goatse]]

For [[moar]], see [[ED| ED's]] [[ASCII]] art page. There are plenty of things there, from [[niggers|racial slurs]] to [[DESU]].
Just remember, Omegle deletes blank spaces, so you must post images that aren't full of black space. Or [[you]] could just [[fail]].

'''Note:''' Please add [[moar]] images!

=== And Moar ===


Now, there should be no girls on the internet. However, it is always possible that one will find the key to the chain keeping her in the kitchen, and find her way to a computer. She will inevitably be "horny f." You have a moral obligation to use her for sex. Begin to cyber, getting pics if offered, and then fap as fap can. When you finish, however, it is time to enter troll mode. Remember - you need to make up for all that time you pretended to like this person. Make it clear that you were lying to her - say you're a girl, that you're 12 years old, that you suddenly have to vomit, or you can simply disconnect without any warning.


[[Image:Trollegle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bonus points if you use Append with the tactics above.]]

== Trolling Tools ==
===Trollegle===
[[Image:Trollegle_1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Properusage of the trollegle tool]]

Tools like [http://www.upload.ee/files/753364/Trollegle.jar.html Trollegle] can not only double your ability to troll, but get two people to simultaneously troll each other. You can play the middle-man and essentially [[S&M|take full control]] of two stranger's conversation. Used correctly, many lulz can be had amidst the confusion.

You could also use it to [[Lonely|eavesdrop on random conversations.]] You'll find that 99% of them are shit.

'''[http://vimeo.com/10196408 (Also, why spy on Omegle's text chats when you can spy on their cams? ChatRoulette, too.)]'''

Use [http://translate.google.com/# Google translator] to confuse and flame users in other languages.
[[Image:Trollegle_2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Irony|A troll getting trolled.]] [[Double Nigger|Double the]] [[Lulz]]]]

===Spy on Omegle===
[[image:SpyOnOmegle.png|thumb|right|it's that easy.]]
'''Spy on Omegle''' is a useful program which, as the name suggests, allows you to spy on other [[Omegle]] conversations and talk to both strangers with names made up by the program. The program comes as a .jar file and will only run on [[Windows]] and [[Lunix]] systems (fuck you [[Mac]] lusers). Like any other freeware software on the internet, it is loaded with more [[virus]]es and bloatware than a cheap [[Asian]] hooker. Okay, just kidding there.

====How to use it====

# Download the updated program [http://omegle-spy.googlecode.com/issues/attachment?aid=3943420633330728609&name=OmegleSpy.jar&token=3eb5b0f6997d8a421288372114fe627f here].
# Open it
#Click 'Start New Conversation'
#Put on [[trollface]]
#[[???]]
#[[PROFIT]]

If you come across errors of any kind, they are usually easily fixed by visiting Omegle and filling out the [[captcha|craptcha]] (or you could just wait 10 seconds before jumping to another conversation). As of August 2010, the creator[[http://code.google.com/u/sfoley1988/|//code.google.com/u/sfoley1988/]] of the programme has made a new version available which circumvents this issue by filling in a craptcha each time you interlope on someone's chat. The above [[Link mah boy|link]] has been [[Rick Roll|corrected]] to link to the updated, [[lazy|fully compiled]] version with [[shit nobody cares about|expanded name list]].

==== What if you get b& or v& ====
Don't worry. It is perfectly legal. We think. [[Some argue|Apparently]], due to the fact that Omegle itself doesn't have a [[TOS|terms of service]] 
policy, spying on other people's conversations is perfectly okay.

==Evidence of Trolls==
The chat service has been a breeding ground for chat logs of mostly mundane--don't get me wrong, occasionally they are funny--humor. These can be viewed as such sites as [http://omeglechats.com/ Omeglechats.com] where users are free to submit their own chatlogs for attempts at internet fame.

== Video Chat ==

Because of how Chatroulette was [[lying|reporting]] that they had [[OVER_9000|over 200,000]] users on at any given time,
Omegle wanted to get in on the action.<br>
So [[moot|Omegle Admins]] [[stole|created]] a [[shit|similar]] service tied into omegle that allows you to:

*1. [[fap|chat]] with [[fat|random]] [[retards|people]].
*2. [[fap|fuck with]] [[fat|random]] [[retards|people]].
*3. [[fap|fap]] to [[traps|hot chicks]].
*4. [[fap|watch]] [[fat|fat people]] [[fap]].
*5. [[fap|cyber]] with [[traps|hot chicks]].

== Omegle as a tool to learn Engrish ==
[[Image:Omegle conversation.jpg|thumb|200px]]
It's been proven a fact that 99.9% of all Omegle users you will ever talk to are AZNZ trying to practice their Engrish. This use of Omegle as a learning tool falls flat on its face as the typical conversation goes like this:

*Stranger1: hi
*Stranger2: hi. a/s/l?
*Stranger1: 14/m/korea i iz trying to praktise my enrish pleez excuse
*Stranger2: oh, okay...
*Stranger1: ...
*Stranger2: ...
*Stranger1: [[cocks]]

== The New Rules ==

[[Image:omeglealt.png|thumb|right|200px|The new alternative [[rule 34|rule 34'd]] Omegle.. somehow there doesn't seem to be a difference.]]

1. Go to [http://www.omegle.com omegle.com] & start a chat

2. Tell the stranger about an updated Omegle & [http://omeglebeta.on.nimp.org link to it.] (do<s>n't</s> click it yourself, dickwad)

3. Lulz ensues.

== Logs ==

Here are some examples of the enlightening conversations being had thanks to this wonderful service:
