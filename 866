'''Basil Marceaux Dot Com''' is a 59-year-old  inventor, entrepreneur, [[drug dealer|importer-exporter]], [[Vietnam]] war [[crazy|veteran]] and historian from [[spengbab|Soddy-Daisy]] and a [[Republican]] candidate for governor, senator, and any other political office he could fail to accede to in a shithole called [[Tennessee]]. This despite the fact that the local [[GOP]] disowns him and have even physically escorted him out of a Republifag meeting. Basil.com likes canned vegetables (well, until 2002 when something happened at Food Lion), replacing tattered flags (until he got Tasered 12 times and institutionalized for 7 days), judo and reading Supreme Court rulings.

In early August [[2010]] he gained [[internet famous|e-notoriety]] soon after his appearance on a local television station to pitch his candidacy and where he demonstrated his perfection of the art of [[harbl|oration]]. [[Some argue]] that '''Basil Marceaux.com''' was drunk in his televised spot but Mr. .com has countered those scurrilous charges. 

{{tinyquote|My speech was slurred because I only have [[meth|three teeth]] and the news program's producers forced me to modify and shorten my statement as I was delivering it.|someone who translated}}

<br>
On a subsequent appearance on [[Jimmy Kimmel]], '''Mr .com''' said that he would consider moving to [[California|Kollyfornia]] to replace [[The Governator]] if he fails to win his local race. This would be made of [[EPIC]] and [[WIN]] and since Californians don't have a problem with voting in retards with speech impediments or any political experience whatsoever, he'd have a p. good chance.

[[File:Basil%2BMarceaux%2B2002.preview.jpg|thumb|200px|Basil Marceaux.com is clearly the best candidate.]]
[[File:Basilmarceauxdotcom.jpg|thumb|200px|Mr Marceaux.com]]
[[File:Basil_marceaux.png|thumb|200px|Mr Marceaux.com is endorsed by [[ED]].]]
[[File:We_are_all_basilmarceauxdotcom.png|200px|thumb|Even [[hipsters]] are basilmarceaux.com]]
Mr. .com has an interesting view on The Constitution.  After much research he has concluded that we've interpreted it all wrong.  He thinks the government doesn't have the right to enforce all the laws they have passed.  He also believes that a law passed in the 1800s allows veterans (or Marines, like himself) to serve as instant judges and enforce their personal rulings.  And he also believes the right to bear arms means you MUST do it.

Apart from that, most of Basil Marceaux.com's platform is based on his personal 'criminal' [http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2010/aug/04/marceaux-has-lengthy-criminal-court-appearance-rec/ history] and the fact that [[The Man]] keeps busting him freeing slaves at traffic stops. Marceaux.com was found not guilty by [[batshit crazy|reason of insanity]] on July 25, 2005, in seven cases involving mostly traffic offenses ranging from driving an unregistered vehicle to failing to have insurance. In previous years, he had been found guilty in a case involving [[vandalism]] and possession of [[crack|drug paraphernalia]]. He was also once arrested for theft and check kiting which he pled guilty to claiming he was duped into accepting campaign contributions from a donor with insufficient funds to cover the deposit.

Mr .com claims that he [[did it for the lulz|he broke these laws on purpose]] to test law enforcement and [[nice try|expose laws he believes to be unconstitutional]]. Marceaux.com said he still visits a psychiatrist based in Rhea County “so I can verify [[orly|nothing is wrong with me]].”

{{quote|As Tennessee Governor in 2010 I will using the Civil Right Act of 1966 for the first time in history to find out two things:

# why [[what?|Democracy invaded the U.S. State on July 16 1866]]
# stop Constitutional Right violations in our state at all cost I will tell you all this

[[DO IT FAGGOT|VOTE FOR ME]] AND IF I WIN I WILL IMMUNE YOU FROM [[WIN|ALL STATE CRIMES FOR THE REST OF YOU LIFE!]] See why [[dental plan|dental is not in most plans]] a tooth aches hurt more than a back aches and [[meth|no teeths depresses people]].

Because the last Republican form of government which was 1866 thought they would rather have [[what?|50 murders on the street than one constitutional violator]], now in 2008 all office holders break their oath the next day|basilmarceaux.com}}

Basil Marceaux wants to plant grass on all vacant lots and sell it. He has elaborated on this idea of his by saying that he and his people (despite not having a campaign committee) want to find out what kind of [[vegetarian]]s would have the best energy returns or, if radishes don't turn out to be a fuel source, then selling the radishes for gas. His fascination and [[gardening|expertise in plants]], some say, is due to him being named after a culinary spice.

He is also tough on crime. He advocates everyone having [[guns]], and believes that if you kill someone or get [[murder]]ed, then you ought to go to jail. He also wants to eliminate traffic stops by the [[police]].

Finally, and probably most importantly, Basil Marceaux wants everyone to say the pledge of allegiance and pray to [[God]].

Basil Marceaux.com is clearly the best candidate.
