A '''President''' is anyone who is in charge of lots of [[shit]]. You can usually tell if you're a president or not based on how many people kiss your ass and how many guns you have.  Many countries, such as El Salvador and [[Texas]], use the presidential system instead of having a [[queen]] or a [[Communism|dictator]].

==The Election Process==

In a [[democracy]] or a [[republic]], the President is chosen by the [[people]] (except in [[Israel]] and the [[United States]], where the President is chosen by [[Jews]]). A specific day is picked and [[noone|everyone]] skips out on work to go vote, thus fulfilling their [[anal sex|civic duty]]. Later on that week the election is contested by the [[Pig bottom|loser]] and then the opponents engage in a fight to the [[death]].

The survivor of the duel then calls his old college/drinking buddies up and invites them to help him run the country into the ground.

==Presidential Powers==
When you're a president, you're allowed to do whatever you want. This includes [[war|blowing shit up]], [[animal abuse|kicking puppies]], eating [[felching|gourmet]] meals, and [[rape|forcing your will]] upon the world. Some presidents have chosen to do this on their own, but others have claimed to do it in the name of [[God]].
