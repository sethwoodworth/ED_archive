'''* Tony has a reputation as a Forum Nazi'''

TeenWolf – 
[http://www.lucasforums.com/showthread.php?t=113712&page=5 “I would sign up to your forums.....but i was there and seen the way one of your moderaters handled someone offering help. He was completley rude its almost sad!”]

Cazor responds- 
“I wasn't around to see the post, Teenwolf, but if it happens again I will not give team members moderation. I dont share the same idea about whoever posted that, because i havent seen whatever that person can do. I'm sorry you had to see that.

Oh and to anyone else reading this, comments like that (there was another rude comment by a non-moderator on the thread Teenwolf linked) will result in the poster being banned. We dont want anything negative on our forums.”
