Sapphiresama12
[[Image:sexysapphire.png|thumb|left| FAPFAPFAPFAPFAP]]
'''Sapphiresama12''', or Toasted-Doughnut as she is known on her current dA account, is a [[hypocritical]], [[fatass]], [[weeaboo]] [[cunt]] who enjoys drawing art that makes [[chasethehedgehog]] look amazing. She is under the delusion that she has many fans and that over the years she has [[lie|IMPROVED SO MUCH!!ONEONE!!]] She constantly bitches at her friends to comment on her [[shit|art]], because standard internet protocol states that the [[moar]] comments the better the content [[amirite]]? [[Image:10_201_Kiriban_1_by_Sapphiresama12.png|thumb|right|whut.]]
She started her [[Jewtube]] and [[deviantart]] accounts back in 2008 and claims to be 14, but you will take one look at her art and believe it was drawn by a newborn black person fetus having a seizure.
Like any DevianTART, she is a [[retard]] with [[USI]] who does anything to make herself look like the innocent one, constantly lying and bitching to friends behind their backs.  She is also an expert in [[internet law]], specializing in frivolous legal threats.
== HER TTLY AMZING ART!!ONEONE!! ==
[[Image:GummyandSapphire.png|thumb|left| OHDEARGOD LOOK AT THE TAIL]]
Amazingly, Sapphfuck has been drawing for 2 years, yet still has not gotten out of the habbit of tracing over pictures of Sakura from Naruto and pairing her mary sues with the [[animu]] guy of her dreams, as well as using traced bases. 
[[Image:Naruto_sakura0105.png|thumb|right|ohmai.]]
It is a sad, sad fact of life that Sapphhairyyellowmoldingvagina is unable to improve her shitty anatomy and shading.
The cause of this is still unknown. It may be the fact that every single critique she gets is sugar coated bullshit from her friends that dosen't help her at all, or perhaps she has some serious case of mental retardation.

== Her and Inuyasha=TRUE RUV ^___________^ ==
[[Image:FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU.JPG|thumb|right|Typical reaction to someone saying they do not wish to roleplay Inuyasha screwing her at this time.]]
[[Image:InuYashaXSapphire by Sapphiresama12.png|thumb|right| IT'S A TRAP]]
Yes, deep in Inuyasha land, that one [[furry|giant dog fag]] decided that instead of having a decent looking teenage slut to [[rape|make love to]], he would rather have an overweight cat girl suck his penis.
According to Sapphbitch, she and Inuyasha are in a deep, passionate love. Because as we all know, she can change the plot of the animu and manga. Why? because she is THEALMIGHTYSAPPHIRECHANSAMASANNYANNYANCHANGOZIMASU!!! ^__^
Unfortunately, her pleading letters to Rumiko Takahashi were burned upon arrival and so she had resorted to the next best thing.
Asking her friends to roleplay him screwing her, guilt tripping them if they refuse to.

''A typical roleplay with Sapphwhore''     
<pre>Inuyasha: *staring at Sapphire* Are you like, connected to that damn couch?
Sapphire: *creepy voice* YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES! *creepy grin*
Inuyasha: > >;; You know that dosen't scare me.
Sapphire: *pretends to have a heart attack*
Inuyasha: Really, thats not going to work. *smirks*
Sapphire: *is really realistic*
Inuyasha: ...Sapph? *leans down, begining to get worried*
Sapphire: *grabs his nose* Gotcha!
Inuyahsa: Gah! Grr...
Inuyasha: *sighs* You really shouldn't worry me like that...
Sapphire: Sorry. I just wanted a little fun.
Inuyasha: Well then, you have to give me something in return then...
Sapphire: Like? Lemme guess, you wanna have fun with me?
Inuyasha: *reaches down to grope her butt, smirking* Mabye..
Sapphire: L-Like how?
Inuyasha: Like this. *tears her shirt off with one of his claws*
Sapphire: Hey! That's all I have to wear!
Inuyasha: You think I care right now? *pushes her down and begins licking her nipples through her bra*
Sapphire: Ah! J-Just how horny are you?! *chuckles*
Inuyasha: I don't know, you tell me. *hand slides up and begins to undo bra strap*
Sapphire: Oh you undo that but you slice off my shirt!
Inuyahsa: Feh. *undos it and begins sucking on one of the breasts*
Sapphire: A-AH! InuYasha! Ah!

Thats right, it gets even better than newborn gorilla having a seizure art. Sapphiresama12 is also one of the biggest hypocrites on the [[interwebz]], and also has her fair share of moments proving her [[Fail|intelligence]].
First off, if [[you]] thought she wasn't enough of an asshole, let this sink in.
A couple years back, Sapphfatass was still forcing all her friends against her will to comment her [[shit|art]]. Now someone who wasn't a complete retard refused to comment and fave her self-important ass. THIS ANGERED THE ALMIGHTY [[idiot|KAWAIISUGOIGOZIMASUNYANNYANCHANSANSAPPHIRE]], and instead of accepting the fact that the [[faggot]] didn't want anything to do with her rainbow colored feces, what did she do?
'''HACK THE FAGGOT'S DEVIANTART ACCOUNT AND MAKE A [[terrorist|JOURNAL THREATNING TO DELETE IT UNLESS SHE FAVED ALL OF HER PICTURES AND COMMENTED ALMOST ALL OF THEM.]]
And that isn't the end of it. Recently, Sapphwhore, being the unoriginal fag that she is, has been [[lolcats|stealing other's inside jokes]], and using them as if she owned them.

Now of course, the victims of the stolen jokes confronted her about this. Her response: "YOU GAUIZ ARE OVEREACTING OVAH A JOKE U FUCKING SUCK".

[20-8-2010 23:56:15] [Sapphire] YES: You sent those three our chatlogs right?
[20-8-2010 23:56:32] EnSnipe: Which three?
[20-8-2010 23:56:44] [Sapphire] YES: The three girls I'm fighing with?
[20-8-2010 23:57:02] EnSnipe: I don't know which three girls you're fighting with.
[20-8-2010 23:57:12] EnSnipe: But I just sent it to one.
[20-8-2010 23:57:14] EnSnipe: Not three.

[20-8-2010 23:58:27] Ensnipe: Why would I tell you?

[0:00:21] [Sapphire] YES: What do you hope to accomplish?
[0:00:35] EnSnipe: You don't deserve to know in my view, for all you could speculate, I could've brought it up there on my own.
And the point was, I told someone what happened, they asked me if they could see it and add it to there.
[0:00:42] EnSnipe: What I hoped to accomplish was a good laugh.
[0:00:47] EnSnipe: And it worked out perfectly.
[0:01:00] [Sapphire] YES: Which one?
[0:01:02] [Sapphire] YES: Sakio?
[0:01:04] [Sapphire] YES: Hito?
[0:01:07] [Sapphire] YES: Miyuki?
[0:01:11] [Sapphire] YES: Which one wanted to know?
[0:01:21] [Sapphire] YES: And it was none of their business
[0:02:43] EnSnipe: You really think I'm going to tell you?
[0:02:54] EnSnipe: And ofcourse, it's not their business.
[0:03:02] EnSnipe: But they didn't mingle in with it either.
[0:03:06] EnSnipe: No one did.
[0:03:10] [Sapphire] YES: Eh?
[0:03:13] [Sapphire] YES: It's on my ED
[0:03:21] EnSnipe: Ahhh, so you made it yourself?
[0:03:28] [Sapphire] YES: Along with the relevation you have a crush on me
[0:03:32] EnSnipe: Why would you make an ED yourself?
[0:03:38] [Sapphire] YES: And no. Sakio made the ED
[0:04:15] EnSnipe: Lol, you think I care about something you implied in that chat?
I'll leave it to the people who read it to decide what it is.
[0:05:07] [Sapphire] YES: You're really immature :/
[0:05:15] [Sapphire] YES: Honestly, you're what 17?
[0:05:27] [Sapphire] YES: Stop arguing with a kid and grow the fuck up.
[0:06:21] [Sapphire] YES: Better be careful what I say though, it'll wind up on ED as well :/
[0:06:38] EnSnipe: So? Do you think I would care if someone could have a good laugh about me on there? xD
[0:06:58] [Sapphire] YES: I sincerely wish they would
[0:06:59] EnSnipe: Besides, you know what's immature as well?
[0:07:11] EnSnipe: Hiding behind the fact that you're 'younger'
[0:07:26] EnSnipe: That's also immature if you didn't know.
[0:07:37] [Sapphire] YES: Being young = immature
[0:07:40] [Sapphire] YES: People grow
[0:07:43] [Sapphire] YES: And change
[0:07:52] EnSnipe: Yes, but, you're not young, you're teenager.
[0:07:58] [Sapphire] YES: You haven't changed a bit from the last time we fought
[0:08:16] [Sapphire] YES: No one is legally mature til 18
[0:08:24] [Sapphire] YES: I'm not 18
[0:08:26] EnSnipe: So that would make me young as well.
[0:08:33] EnSnipe: So, you screwed yourself there.
[0:08:48] [Sapphire] YES: It's different in your country, right?
[0:08:56] [Sapphire] YES: I believe you said it was 16 there
[0:09:00] [Sapphire] YES: I'm not 16 either
[0:10:44] [Sapphire] YES: I'm not there and you aren't here. Therefore we must follow our countries laws.
[0:10:57] EnSnipe: No, it's not different here.
[0:11:13] [Sapphire] YES: You said the legal age is 16
[0:11:17] EnSnipe: For drinking.
[0:11:28] [Sapphire] YES: What about everthing else?
[0:11:51] EnSnipe: 18 years old to get a drivers' license.
[0:12:13] [Sapphire] YES: You're far far closer to 18 than I am at the very least
[0:12:32] EnSnipe: Does not change the fact I'm still under 18 years.
[0:12:52] [Sapphire] YES: For what four months?
[0:12:57] [Sapphire] YES: I have years to go\
[0:13:07] EnSnipe: Doesn't change it.
[0:13:22] EnSnipe: This is now, not over 4 months.
[0:13:49] [Sapphire] YES: You should still be more mature than I am
[0:14:41] EnSnipe: Then let me ask.
[0:14:46] EnSnipe: What is the immature part that I did?
[0:14:55] EnSnipe: I just talked to someone.
[0:15:02] EnSnipe: I mentioned the 'arguement' we had.
[0:15:05] EnSnipe: I showed the chatlogs.
[0:15:07] [Sapphire] YES: And gave them shit that was private
[0:15:08] EnSnipe: Like you always did.
[0:15:13] [Sapphire] YES: I was 13
[0:15:17] [Sapphire] YES: Not 17
[0:15:36] EnSnipe: So, because I'm 17, means I may not show any chatlogs to someone?
[0:15:49] [Sapphire] YES: That isn't what I siad
[0:15:51] [Sapphire] YES: *said
[0:16:06] [Sapphire] YES: But I had the drama almost gone and you helped restart it OTL
[0:16:30] EnSnipe: Then that's your problem with the people you have drama with.
[0:16:43] [Sapphire] YES: You helped it, knowing I was in it
[0:17:23] EnSnipe: So I showed chatlogs?
I got asked for permission if they wanted to put it on there, I accepted it.
[0:17:59] [Sapphire] YES: Permission should lie in both peoples hands
[0:18:03] [Sapphire] YES: Not just yours
[0:18:32] EnSnipe: It's my computer, my files.
Permission to give off content of a file lies in the owner of it.
[0:18:41] EnSnipe: You have your files of content, I have mine.
[0:18:46] [Sapphire] YES: My file as well idiot
[0:18:49] EnSnipe: I have my rights on mine and you have your own.
[0:18:57] [Sapphire] YES: I was involved just as much as you were
[0:18:58] EnSnipe: No, because if you delete your files, mine will still be here.
[0:19:05] EnSnipe: So, that makes them MY files.
[0:19:17] EnSnipe: Unless you can prove to me you paid for my computer, they remain to be my files.
[0:19:32] [Sapphire] YES: So what, I wasn't in the convo?
[0:19:47] [Sapphire] YES: I have no right over what was revealed?
[0:20:03] [Sapphire] YES: Those were my words AND yours
[0:20:06] [Sapphire] YES: OUR file
[0:20:15] [Sapphire] YES: Not just yours and not just mine
[0:20:20] EnSnipe: Yes you were, I never said the content pointed to specific people, but aslong as you talk to me, you accept that I have an ability to show those textlogs.
[0:20:41] EnSnipe: Two names were given in the chatlogs.
[0:20:53] EnSnipe: At the moment my name was erased out and changed, those weren't my logs anymore.
[0:20:58] EnSnipe: Since someone ELSE editted them.
[0:21:05] [Sapphire] YES: Why was my name still there?
[0:21:11] [Sapphire] YES: It's still MY log
[0:21:20] [Sapphire] YES: I'm still in it
[0:21:24] EnSnipe: Did you give your logs?
[0:21:30] EnSnipe: No.
[0:21:32] [Sapphire] YES: To anyone?
[0:22:21] EnSnipe: Aslong as you don't send your logs to anyone, those are your files.
As soon as I send those files to anyone else, those are MY files.
I hold right to send or delete them.
[0:22:33] EnSnipe: You do not hold rights to send or delete the files on my computer.
[0:22:54] [Sapphire] YES: And you don't own any rights for the chatlogs I used to send by your logic
[0:23:08] EnSnipe: Yes, the logs you have on your computer, are your files.
[0:23:10] EnSnipe: Not mine.
[0:23:18] [Sapphire] YES: And yes, I sent the chatlogs that we had.
[0:23:21] [Sapphire] YES: To Cara
[0:23:35] [Sapphire] YES: Because I was frusterated and KNEW she wouldn't do anything like that
[0:23:36] EnSnipe: Then they are your files, you sent to Cara, not my files, I sent to someone else.
[0:23:53] [Sapphire] YES: You're going in  a cirle
[0:24:07] [Sapphire] YES: And these files will be sent to Cara as well
[0:24:19] Kurasu: Try and understand this.
[0:24:32] EnSnipe: If you would delete your own chatlogs, mine would still be here, so that means they're seperate files.
[0:24:38] EnSnipe: Just with the same contents.
[0:24:47] EnSnipe: Which means, seperate files, can lead to seperate owners.
[0:24:58] [Sapphire] YES: You have right over your WORDS
[0:25:04] [Sapphire] YES: I can send anything I say.
[0:25:22] [Sapphire] YES: But I can't send what you say without permission
[0:25:27] EnSnipe: I can send anything that's on my computer, aslong as I don't break any laws.
[0:25:57] [Sapphire] YES: You're not listening to anything I'm saying are you?
[0:26:07] EnSnipe: Because you're saying bullshit and don't even listen to me.
[0:26:13] EnSnipe: They are TWO seperate files.
[0:26:18] EnSnipe: One you have, one I have.
[0:26:23] EnSnipe: You have no saying over MY files.
[0:26:37] EnSnipe: Do you finally get it now?
[0:26:41] [Sapphire] YES: Dude, it's a privacy law OTL
[0:26:56] [Sapphire] YES: You can't send my words without permission
[0:26:58] EnSnipe: So you talked about something specificly related to what you created?
[0:27:14] [Sapphire] YES: And I can't send your words without permission
[0:27:23] EnSnipe: No, that's what you THINK.
[0:27:36] EnSnipe: Files and words aren't video's or games made by someone.
[0:27:53] EnSnipe: If you may not send without permission from another, these 'chatlogs' would not exist.
[0:28:10] [Sapphire] YES: Eh?
[0:28:20] [Sapphire] YES: I don't understand that last part
[0:29:01] EnSnipe: Think.
[0:29:15] EnSnipe: If these logs are created, that means they're legal to create and to send to someone else.
[0:29:22] EnSnipe: Or else they would not become a file I could access.
[0:29:25] [Sapphire] YES: Data logging

Many programs and operating systems are set up to perform data logging of usage. This may include recording times when the computer is in use, or which web sites are visited. If a third party has sufficient access to the computer, legitimately or not, the user's privacy may be compromised. This could be avoided by disabling logging, or by clearing logs regularly.
