Warbears/SLWalkthrough
[[Warbears]] has had [[BayHorseCrew|all it's secrets revealed]]! [[nothing|what ever will we do now?]]

== [[OMG]] SECRETS REVEALED ==
The secret location is triggered by a chain of events, starting by asking the policeman in the bar "What's that?". He will respond by telling you that the "[[crime]] scene" with the chalk outline is simply the product of his [[boredom]]. He will move on to the reason he is there: the Bartender has gone missing. He will finish by telling you that the [[old]] man in the park was the last person to see him.

"Grandpa", as he is known, points you in the direction of a mysterious shack in the woods. It will now appear on the map, near the edge of the boundary. Note the [[Cellar|shack]] you are looking for has a "p" over it, not the other one with an "m" which denotes the second mission.

The first "level" of the secret location is the outside of the shack. The clue says '''''VERBAL AUTHORITY is the key''''', and the password is '''''OPEN''''', in capital letters as shown.

The second level is inside the shack and is marked Level 0. This is an actual clue to the password, which is '''''level 1'''''.

The crate in the corner in Level 1-A can be opened and will give 250 credits the first time. The clue here says '''''Be polite''''' and the password is '''''thank you'''''.

Level 1-B has a sign, the clue being '''''Are you sure?'''''. The password is '''''yes'''''.

Level 1-C has a patch of red carpet in the center of the floor. This is a clue, the password is '''''red'''''.

Level 1-D has a checker pattern on the floor. The clue is that the configuration of the tiles (but not the object grid) is 8 by 8, the same pattern in chess and checkers. Thus, the password is '''''chess'''''.

The floor of Level 1-E has a [[random]] combination of blue and grey floor tiles. This is irrelevant, as the sign is the real clue. '''''This time the answer is simple''''' can be hard to catch on to, but the answer is indeed '''''simple'''''.

The centerpiece of Level 1-F is an Octagon in the center of the floor, with a crossed-out 5 in the center. This is the clue for this room, the password is ''''8''''.

In Level 1-G there is a poster on the wall with the first three letters of the names of various colors, printed in colors as well. "Red" is the only name on the poster not printed in it's own color, instead it is in green. "red" has already been used as a password, so the password can be deduced as '''''green'''''.

The symbol [[âˆž]] is marked on the wall in Level 1-H, the mathematical symbol for infinity. '''''infinity''''' is the password.

Level 1-I features a strange symetrical pattern on the floor. This is a vague clue, the answer is '''''mirror'''''.

The next room is completely void of any features. This is actually the clue, the password is '''''nothing'''''.

Level 1-M has the number 1 in one corner and 16 in the other. There are 16 squares in the room. The ladder to the next level is on square 10, giving the password '''''10'''''. In the other door is a room with a crate. Type '''''w''''' to open it.

In Level 2-A, '''''The missing letters''''' referres to the skip after the "nothing room" from 1-I to 1-M. The password is '''''jkl'''''.

There are 12 shaded squares in Level 2-B. The password is '''''12'''''.

The numbers on the floor in 2-C are all prime numbers. Thus the password, '''''prime numbers'''''. In this room is the first page of the bartender's diary, the piece of paper on the floor. This is the text that appears when the "read" option is clicked on.

''Bartender Diary, Page 1:
I can't believe I used it.. I
couldn't figure out the answer
to that riddle.. I let my anger
prevail. Judging from what
happened, I'm lucky to be still
alive!''

Level 2-D is a cube-shaped room with cube numbers on the wall. The password is '''''cube'''''.

Level 2-E has random letters on the wall. Only four of the letters actually mean anything. The clue is the shaded squares on the ground. The password is '''''bear'''''.

Level 2-F's hint is the backwards ? on the floor. The password is '''''kram noitseuq'''''.

In Level 2-G there are two doors, and two raised tiles with the letter two on them. The second page of the bartender's diary can be found here, and the following text appears when it is read.

''Bartender Diary, Page 2:
That plate on the wall of L2A.. it
was on L1A too and now I
understand what it is for. It
would have been useful if I had
planned to leave this place
before reaching the last level.''

The answer for Level 2-G is '''''2'''''. Going to the upper door, you find that the door that is blocked is also closed. Take the lower door first, to Level 2-H.

The answer in level 2-H is '''''26'''''. 14+4=18, 18+8=26, 26+16=42, 42+32=74. It's the previously added number times 2.

In Level 2-I, the letters are one after the required one in the [[English]] alphabet. The answer is '''''next room'''''.

The password to Level 2-J is '''''25'''''. Each row follows the same [[math]]. Figure it out. X-Y+Z=n

On the wall of Level 2-K is the phrase "2L ?". The answer is '''''water'''''.

Back to Level 2-L, where the door should be open and the following answers will lower the blocks; '''''h''''', '''''2''''', '''''o''''', '''''t'''''.

Ignore Level 2-M and head straight to the back room. This crate is exactly like the one on Level 1, except now you type '''''t'''''.

Back in Level 2-M, notice the square grid and the number on the first tile. The door is on the 2nd tile from the left and from the top, so the answer is '''''22'''''. (As of typing this, this is as far as you can go in the secret location.)
