'''Tracing:''' (present tense verb) In the act of copying another piece of artwork, typically done by those in the third grade, and the [[retard|ones]] we look to for [[lulz]]. 

==Preamble==
Tracing, or "omg traced >:(" and "TRACING IS NOT ART! AAAA!" are usually the war cry of talentless [[furry]] and [[animu]] [[white knights]], these are generally [[underage]] kids who draw so-called [[shit|original arts]], in seek of popularity while the said "tracers" gains more popularity and pageview. 
Tracing creates an infinite butthurtness in the community where people thinks it's important. 

in other terms, tracing is another kind of [[shit nobody cares about]] but the [[butthurt]], so we'll develop what is tracing in this article, this may enlighten [[you]] for sure, all that about a cheap way to create something fappable and by the way, make the starving [[furry]] [[artist]] rage and whine about [[you]].

==TRACING 101==
So you're in high school, and you've already decided that [[unrealistic expectations|you're going to be a famous manga-ka]] when you grow up. But how to start out? The world of art can be a big and terrifying place. Fortunately, you recently found out about a wonderful site called [[DeviantART]] that hosts online galleries for [[Basement Dwellers|amateur artists]] from some of your [[Tartlet|fellow artist-aspirants]]. Even more pretty, tracing in the fanart section is even legalized. As read [http://news.deviantart.com/article/40612/ here]
The only problem is that you're too damn untalented to spend the time and effort to learn how to draw.  I mean, you have [[Neopets]] to take care of, [[hug]]s to give out, a [[Gaia]] avatar to dress up, a [[LiveJournal]] to maintain, a [[Sonic]] [[fanfic]] and an [[Invader Zim]] [[Slashfic]] in the works, and a pile of [[yaoi]] manga to read. Not only that, but you must also attend to an ever-increasing buildup of messages from [[Pedophiles|talent agents]] and [[Internet stalking|admirers]] parading through your dA inbox. These days, nobody has time to draw when they could be busy wasting it on petty, [[social networking]]-related gossip.

With such a busy schedule, how can you possibly find the time to make up for your blatant lack of skills?  The answer is simple: You '''trace''' existing artwork.


==Tracing causes drama==
One of the numerous things that causes TARTlets to become massively butthurt and proceed to [[cut]] themselves is the idea of stealing artwork.  They will preach the depravity of art theft like [[template:closetcases|gay Republicans who insist they are straight]].  Like all [[teenagers]], they will [[serious business|violently deny]] tracing if they are caught/accused of it, despite mounting piles of evidence or public outcry from their fellow TARTlets. Another fun outcry for them is "I used the [[GRIDS|grids]]!". [[AIDS|Grids]] are for [[fags]]. End of story.

[[Realmrsoptimusprime|Also a lot of the tracers who happen to be highly watched in DA are supported by uncaring fans who will believe anything or refuse anything that's against their artist despite the evidence is right in front of their big stupid faces.]] For them, only the final result counts and in final, guess what brings thousands of [[faggots|pageviews?]] a nice, anatomically correct drawing traced from a [[porn]] photo, a recoloring or vectorizing of a picture you take? these techniques allows you to make something popular, and for this, the anti-tracing brigade will never forgive you for a simple reason, it's raining fav's on you now, for least you got some little [[photoshop|photoshopping]] skills, anybody, regardless of the moral of ethic can make something epic, and by the way [[troll]] a thousand screaming [[furry]] [[Dramawhore|drama whores]].

hell, you can even pretend [[capitalism|selling]] some prints with that, now the DA-[[mods]] stopped to care, and being pointy about it... unless you have some [[moralfag|morals]] and decide to develop your own [[shit|style]], but if you suck, you suck. period. 



==Trace is legal now!==
Thanks to the closet dyke and our most [[Lazy|hardworking]] admin evar [[Chix0r|Chix0r]], the tracing is now AWWWWWRIGHT by the devianTART [[Shit|Policy]] as seen here [http://news.deviantart.com/article/70128/]. This shitty article started the rage of the [[Over 9000|Over 9000]] devianTARD, bawwing artists, while at least 400 tracing faggots rejoiced for being safe from banhammer if they put the reason why they made shitty tracings of the already shit art. DeviantART now expects [[bawww|an avalanch of traced shits, vectors, plagiarism and art theft]], what the site always been about since ten years of course, and best of all; the priceless [[butthurt]]ness of a thousand raging talentless deviants.

In conclusion, since tracing is not against the real [[law]] on intellectual property and copyrights, and in fact, never have been; the admins finally realized they have just better things to care about, like focusing on real violations, maybe? 

The remaining art communities caring about this form of art theft :

===Todd Vs Dave===
[[Image:Goldmantrace.png|thumb|center|300px|Busted!]]
A drama lolcano erupted [[last Thursday]] when long time art-theft [[Todd Goldman]] decided to trace one of [[Dave Kelly]]'s furry ideas [http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2416213&perpage=40&pagenumber=1].  The outraged goons at [[SomethingAwful]] spread the story to the internets, but many of the blogs that reported it had the reports taken down due to a [[lolsuit]]:
*[http://blog.wired.com/tableofmalcontents/2007/04/todd_goldman_th.html Wired magazine report replaced by lawsuit letter]
*[http://www.boingboing.net/2007/04/21/todd-goldmans-lawyer.html BoingBoing with a copy of the same letter]

===Nick Simmons===
[[File:IncarnateBleachOverlay11.jpg|thumb|center|300px]][[File:IncarnateBleachComparison3.png|thumb|center|300px]]
Nick Simmons, son of Gene Simmons from KISS decided to make a manga made up entirely of traced panels from [[Bleach]], [[Hellsing]] and [[Tartlet]] artwork. Notice a pattern here? Yet another Jew plagiarizing work from us goy. Notice that Jews are never capable of creations of their own.

==List of DeviantArt Clubs Fighting Tracers!==
Don't be afraid, the real, lawful and original [[whiteknight|artists]] are getting organized and develop their comparison techniques everyday to determine if a picture is traced, and if the case, which is the original! if not, eyeballed.

You are now afraid of these people, one day they will make tracing against the [[lol|law]], and you will be doomed to draw terrible crap, forever, unless you use some common sense and pic any good picture on the internet and create something worth of it like every more or less popular "artist" does.
