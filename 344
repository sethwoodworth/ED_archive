'''Alexander4488''' ([[Power word|Full name]]: Alexander [[Muslim|Jared]] [[Nazi|Hans]] [[Paki|Badr]]) is a retarded [[intellectual checkmate|smug]] [[Canadia|Canadian]] and wannabe filmmaker who creates [[pathetic]] video game reviews with the clichéd [[Angry Video Game Nerd|"angry nerd"]] shtick in them on [[YouTube]]. He also visits the [[Shit|Vancouver Film School]], hoping to [[Unrealistic expectations|"become a better director and filmmaker"]] and promotes himself as the greatest thing on YouTube next to the Angry Video Game Nerd, despite the fact that he is one of the worst [[Video game reviewers|reviewers]] of all time.

|style="font-size:10pt;"|''Yes. That is my full name. Where did you find it? Oh yes, it was posted on my Facebook page, linked to my Youtube account, so no one will ever find it, but you. Bravo. I don't Google my name on an hourly basis. I just click on the links embedded on my videos. Simple as that. Besides, it's funny reading all of these stupid articles. You make it seem like I'm a one-minded wolf with one goal; To kill everything that stands in my way. That is not the case. As I mentioned before, I like these criticisms mainly because most are beyond illogical, but also because some are true (I will get into that later).''
|}

But dare you ever insult or criticize him! Alexander4488 [[paranoid|Googles his name on a hourly basis]] to find out if anyone has ever written anything bad about him or his videos. If that is the case, he will mercilessly track you down and [[Flame war|try to defend his good name]]! Fortunately, he responds to everything, which thrusts the potential for [[lulz]] upwards.

And with no proof either.''

{{quote|Regarding the two links: I fucked sheep when I forced them to read your stupid comments.|Alexander|reacting to the [[:Image:Alex4488_15.png|screenshot]] exposing him as a sheep fucker}}

Just like every [[Video Game Reviewers|video game reviewer]] on YouTube, he was [[leech|"influenced"]] by the [[Angry Video Game Nerd]]'s videos. But his passion went a little too far: He claims that [[stalker|he has sent hand-written letters to James Rolfe]] and also created a [[not|TOTALLY FUNNY AND ORIGINAL]] video game reviewing series on YouTube by the name of the [[Epic Fail|Annoyed Gaming Geek]]. However, Alexander realized that the name was too similar to the AVGN's and changed it -- his only smart decision so far -- to the '''Gay Douche'''.

The name changed, the fad remained: in his [[Shit|"reviews"]] -- which are actually more like rants -- the Gay Douche sits there and needlessly bitches about [[Shit no one cares about|small aspects of the game which really no one cares about]]. At the end, he invents new swear words (most preferably with [[gay|"ass"]]) and combines them to the point where they mean nothing anymore. There's even more: The Gay Douche also [[retro|rants about new games]] from old [[Mario|Nintendo]] or [[Sonic|Sega]] franchises -- up to the point where he trashes them because they offer new or different options and details.

To cut a long story short: Alexander4488's reviews are the love child of the [[AVGN]]'s swearing, the [[Irate Gamer]]'s stupidity and [[Spax3]]'s [[Retro|retrofaggotry]].

|style="font-size:10pt;"|''My passion went too far by sending hand written letters? Can you be any stupider? Gay Douche... See, that is actually clever. The reviewers are more like rants. I only have (review) in the titles so they will be found, but if that is deceiving, then I will easily change that. Bitches about stuff nobody cares about? No. Only stuff that you don't care about. Make no sense? Care to give an example? I never bashed any game for being "new." (Quote my Spyro review: The game is very different from the classics, but that's not the problem. The problem is that it sucks dragon balls). You fail at assumptions. Therefore, get your facts straight before you claim such retarded nonsense.''

I wrote (nerd quote) to cite my source. Perhaps I shouldn't have had those lines in there at all. In that case, I may remove them if I revise the review. One more thing.

== Fanbase == 
{{quote|fuck you jaquan1254, alexnader4488 is﻿ awesome|{{youtube2|Kylebuschfan187|Kylebuschfan187}}|who isn't able to type Alexander's name correctly}}

{{quote|I saw the Barbie commentary those two people in the commentary were making﻿ fun of you. [[Unrealistic expectations|Block them from going on YouTube.]]|{{youtube2|PaperShadow2001|PaperShadow2001}}|new to the Internets}}

|style="font-size:10pt;"|''They write the truth. Well, I myself don't like my videos (I actually dislike them more than everyone), but I still make them to get better at it and because others like them. One day, I may make very good reviews. You on the other hand, will always be a basement dwelling dweeb.''
|}

His fanbase are the same scum that like the [[shit|wackiness]] of [[CAD|Ctrl+Alt+Delete]] or Irate Gamer's [[offended|unneeded swearing]]: [[13-year-old boys]], [[furries]], [[retard|retards]] and [[Ulrichthehedgehog|retarded 13-year-old furries]]. Like every [[fanboy]], they come to defend the person that - in their eyes - is the [[Lie|greatest and funniest video game reviewer of all time]], not realizing how much their [[God|idol]] sucks.

The reason why most of Alexander's fans are [[13-year-old boys|under the age of 16]] is that sooner or later they'll have to realize that Alexander's style of reviewing is just a [[ripoff|carbon copy]] of the [[AVGN]]'s style. Thus, they decide to leave the "fann comunity" and prefer to flame Irate Gamer's videos as AVGN Nazis.

|}

== [[Spam|"Promotion"]] ==
Alexander4488 gained notoriety by his, let's say, "unconventional" way of promotion: [[Facepalm|spamming every gaming website and YouTube video ever]]. These hilariously blunt attempts to boost his popularity (and [[butthurt]] responses) can be seen here.
