Internet jail
{{Elaw}}  

'''Internet jail''' is where internet criminals go after being found [[internet guilty]] in <br/> [[internet court]]. This is the foundation of the internet prison-industrial <br/> complex, and most prisoners spend years forging [[spam]] headers which are <br/> later used against their [[IRL]] family and friends.

There is no one to [[raep]] them [[in the ass]] in an internet jail [[unfunny|though]].
