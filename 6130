'''PIFTS.exe''' is a recent [[Norton]] embedded "[[spyware|feature]]" which [[PIFTS.exe#The_program_analyzed|is logging]] all [[Google]] searches and cookies, then sending a report to several agencies, including not only Symantec but also [[Microsoft]], a strange server in [[Africa]] and a [[government]] server in [[Washington]] D.C. PIFTS.exe is also known to give your computer AIDS and e-mail your grandmother crude photoshops of your head on top of a gay porno actor being fucked in the ass with a rake.

PIFTS.exe was first discovered by a user on /g/, who was subsequently told to make a thread on the Norton forums to find out just what the fuck was going on. After said post was made, it was deleted by the Norton moderators. It was also soon discovered that all Google references to the Pifts.exe had mysteriously vanished from the interwebs, and that this page is blocked from StumbleUpon.

Anonymous waited. The firewall notice in front of him blinked and warned out of nowhere. There were trojans in the computer. He didn't see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Norton users were not listened to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.

Anonymous was safeguarding for 5 years now. When he was young he watched the trojans and said to Norton "I want to help defend against viruses Norton." Norton said "No! You will DOWNLOAD OUR PROGRAM" There was a time when he believed them. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the midst of Anons without UAC or firewalls he knew there would be trojans. "This is /b/" 4chan crackered. "You must fight the pifts!" So Anonymous got his raids and blew up the Norton forums.

"THEY ARE GOING TO KILL US!" said the Norton
"I will enable magic_lantern at them" and he started gathering loli and shota information from Anon. Anon explodeded their vans at them and tried to blew Norton up. But then the website fell and they were not able to kill.
"No! I must kill the pifts!" Anon shouted

The Digg said, "No, Anon. You are the pifts."

And then /b/ was a pifts.

== [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Lantern_(software) Magic Lantern]: the main target is [[You|YOU]] ==

Magic Lantern is keystroke logging software developed by the [[FBI|United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation]].

[[Jews|Symantec]], the makers of Norton AntiVirus and related products, is reportedly working with the FBI on ways to preclude their products from detecting Magic Lantern. Eric Chien, a top researcher at Symantec, emphasized the ability to detect "modified versions."

In other words, [[Ceiling Cat|the FBI]] is [[Fact|watching you masturbate]], and they like it.

== Norton's Statement ==

{{squote|Hi everyone,
<br>
No doubt you've read the Official Statement about PIFTS.EXE and the reasons why many posts were removed from this forum. [[Bullshit|There was no "conspiracy" or "cover-up"]] - someone was spamming our forums, and we took action to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|remove these posts]]. As it increased over a few hours, many threads were [[raped|removed]], and several users were [[b&|denied access]] to post in the forums. [[Nigeria|We were gathering information to distribute]], and [[lie|I'm sorry it took this long]] to post the info to everyone.
<br>
<br>
After reviewing some of the emails I've received, it appears that some posts were [[lie|removed in error]], as well as the access of some users. If you feel your access was removed in error, please [[rape|contact]] me [[in the ass|directly]] (my email address is listed on my user profile) and [[lie|I will restore your access to the forums]]. I apologize for this inconvenience, and [[fuck you|thank you]] for your patience while we [[fap|deal]] with this [[CP|difficult situation]]. Thank you also to the [[faggots|users]] who have helped us identify the malicious posts to this forum, it was a big help.
<br>
<br>
For the sake of keeping the PIFTS.EXE questions consolidated, please feel free to post all your questions/comments about PIFTS.EXE to this thread. Please do not post to a new thread, as we wish to keep all posts in one area. Before you post, please review our [[bullshit|official statement]] for [[lies|answers]] to your questions.

This is obviously a damn dirty lie, as the admins were almost instantly deleting all PIFTS.exe-related threads long before /b/, or even /x/ got word of it.

It clearly goes through and scrapes your history, temp files, cookies, etc, and it tries to contact a shady online storage place<br> they recently acquired. Let's do a lookup on swapdrive! 67.134.208.160:80 is where PIFTS.exe asks to connect to.<br>
<br>
Domain Name: SWAPDRIVE.COM<br>
<br>
Administrative Contact:<br>
Wallace, Marc<br>
Web Data Group, LC<br>

Click on " Competitive intelligence." Interesting! They talk about military intelligence gathering right on the page. So this<br> "update" is scraping internet history and temp data and trying to contact a company who does online storage with shady ties to<br> intelligence gathering. If it is datamining, Americans need not be surprised, we had AT&T do it on our phones and some act as if<br> our computers are immune. Hey, let's look more into one of the owners of Swapdrive in the Web Data Group! There are more<br> interesting people than Marc Wallace.<br>
<br>
"Roland Schumann is a former military intelligence officer, having served both on active duty and in the reserves. Trained in<br> unconventional warfare and electronic intelligence gathering, he also has practical experience in airborne operations, human<br> intelligence (HUMINT), counter-intelligence, and counter-terrorism. He has performed risk analyses in Latin America for the US<br> government and in the United States for commercial and government interests."<br>
<br>
It is helped to be run by a former military intelligence officer. So there you have it, you have very shady actions by Symantec<br> regarding the whole thing making people suspicious by deleting any mention of it, they claim it is a simple update, and when we<br> dive into it, we find out it scrapes your internet history and temp files, interfaces with Google Desktop (G O E C 6 2 ~ 1 . D L L )<br>, and then where does it try to go? It tries to jump straight to Swapdrive (we know this because it asked permission to<br> go to 67.134.208.160:80, which is Swapdrive). Who owns swapdrive? The Web Data Group based out of Arlington (wow, the same place the<br> Pentagon is located, what a coincidence) who has a statement about using military intelligence information gathering right on their<br> website and who has owners with shady backgrounds as army intelligence officers, and when Symantec is asked about PIFTS.exe, it<br> immediately tries to cover it up and deletes everything related to it in a very suspicious fashion. Follow the trail, do some research, dig around.<br>
<br>
Oh no folks, move along, certainly nothing interesting to see here!<br>
<br>

== Raid Info ==

[[Image:Early_in_raid.png|thumb|left|In during shitstorm.]]

/b/ raided the Norton forums early in the morning on March 10, 2009, following the leak of info about the existence of PIFTS from /g/ to /x/ and eventually to /b/ itself.

Early in the raid, when the [[faggot|wonderful]] mods still gave a shit, the forums looked something like this. It quickly turned to shit, and lulz ensued all around.

The raid expanded to include trying to Digg the following articles to the front page; [http://digg.com/security/The_mysterious_Norton_cover_up_and_pifts_exe Digg (1)] and [http://digg.com/software/What_is_PIFTS_and_why_is_Symantec_covering_it_up Digg (2)].

Most messages were cleaned up and a second shit storm raid <s>has now</s> began.

After loads of [[Epic win|EPIC WIN]] Norton got [[butthurt|butthurt]] and disabled the "New Thread" button.
