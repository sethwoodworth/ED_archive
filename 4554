[[Image:Michaelmoore.jpg|thumb|Compare to [[Michael Moore]], the gun and camera toting self righteous socialist.]]Kevin Smith, or '''Blunty3000''' (aka Deviloftas and real name '''Nate Burr''') is a [[shortman|short]] [[fat]] bearded, chainsmoking screenwriter, actor, and director from [[New Jersey]] who has [[jumped the shark]]. Kevin's physical appearance very much resembles that of a Portuguese garden gnome. He is also a comic book author, but [[noone]] really gives a [[shit]].  

He began his career with edgy, [[indie]] works like ''Clerks'', ''Mallrats'', and ''Chasing Amy'', which were hailed as revolutionary and [[genius]] because they featured such universally appealing topics as [[marijuana]], [[blasphemy]], [[lesbians]], and [[necrophilia|fucking dead people]] in convenience store restrooms, thus elevating Smith to demigod status among [[fangirl]]s, [[hipster|scene kids]], and [[stoner]]s alike. This is the reason why you will find "Kevin Smith" listed as [http://www.livejournal.com/interests.bml?int=kevin+smith an interest] in the [[LiveJournal]] of nearly everyone. 

As per tradition, as soon as Smith gained critical acclaim and worldwide populatirty, he immediately [[sold out]] and lost all his talent. His more recent films are all indistinguishable slurg that feature Jennifer Lopez getting married then dying, and/or Ben Affleck performing [[auto-fellatio]] for 120 minutes. Old-school fans have been known to frantically begin sawing away at their wrists with their own teeth at the mere mention of ''Jersey Girl''.  

Fans continue to hold out hope for Smith's triumphant return from mediocrity and are advised to seek [[Suicide|medication]]. As of late, people seem to think he's made a comeback by making a sequel to his only "good" movie (''Mr. Smith Quits the Film Industry'', 1999), titled ''Mr. Smith Gets a Lobotomy''. But they're all perverted sickos.

Smith is often seen with [[douchebag|Jason Mewes]] as Jay and Silent Bob. The pair were the most popular characters from the original ''Clerks'' movie and, as a result of this, Smith has included them in every single fucking movie since.

Smith is also incapable of making a decision- he claims to hate the Tim Burton ''Batman'' films and claims that Michael Keaton was a poor choice, yet ass-kisses both of them on the DVD bonuses. He insults Burton for minuscule "changes" to the source even though he was willing to bend over for the producer of a failed ''Superman'' movie and write a Superman that didn't fly and Doomsday riding a mechanical spider. Smith no doubt hits up Mewes' own drug stash periodically.

Recently, Southwest Airlines kicked Smith off of one of their airplanes, allegedly because he is such a big fat fuck that he couldn't fit into one of their ridiculously small and crowded seats.  Smith retaliated by stirring up a shitstorm on Twitter.

==Smith and Criticism==

''Clerks II'' offers yet more of Smith's original, witty humor, such as fast food clerks putting flies on the food of a customer they don't like! According to this report, it's only scratching the surface of Smith's wit [http://youtube.com/watch?v=LN8MtecsKjw&mode=related&search=]. Critic Joel Siegel walked out of the movie halfway through because it was a propagandistic [[scientology]] shit fest, and in response Kevin Smith confronted him about it on [[Opie and Anthony|a radio show]]. Fans circle jerked each other over this confrontation because they believe Smith [[pwned]] ancient Joel Siegel. In reality, all he did was cry and whine. Siegel didn't realize he was actually talking to Smith because, with his low opinion of him, he never assumed that Smith would go so far as to moan at people who didn't like his shitty movie.

Smith's fan base is such a total and complete cross sections of America's idiot-savant comic book collectors, undisciplined perverts, misfits, basement dwellers, geeks, nerds, junkies, pariahs, zoophiles, along with the whole gamut of wankers, butt hole sniffers, losers, and unidentifiable undefinable jokers and weirdos that the pudgy little bearded fat fucker with his backward ballcap is in extreme danger of never knowing when to stop pushing the the raunchy envelope even further. 

Case in points illustrating the backward evolution in the Clerks Trilogy: 

       With Clerks 1: There is an account of an old man dying while shitting and a woman claiming to have fucked his corpse by accident. 
       With Clerks 2: There is a scene alluding to a grown man buttfucking a donkey and showing it through silhouette.

What next in Clerks 3:? God only knows.  There are negotiations being discussed with the hard core gay porn industry.   There is money to be made and the eager fans are ready: 

Most likely Clerks 3 will include a long awaited love scene between not only the 2 main characters of Clerks 1 & 2 but definitely a foursome that includes Smith and Jason Mewson and anyone else that wants to join into the orgy with a full on "ass to mouth" (a quote from Clerks 2) as the only requirement. 


Yet Blunty3000 has always been a whiny fucking [[emo]] [[bitch]] about criticism of his films, even on the [[internets]], which is [[serious business|serious fucking business]]. ''Jay and Silent Bob [[Strike]] Back'' for instance was an autobiographical movie of a time when Kevin Smith and his drug-laden boyfriend Jason Mewes went around [[America]] hunting down kids who called Clerks I crap on Rotten Tomatoes. Instead of satirizing his critics, Smith only ends up painting himself as even more of a [[loser]].

Even though Kevin comes across as a huge homophobe, [[irl]] his brother is actually gay. Logically, they most likely share the "gay" gene, which may support why Smith continues to act and create super shitty movies.
