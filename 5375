Microvision

'''Microvision''' was [[teh]] very first handheld [[video game]] system [[evar]], released in 1979 by Milton Bradlulz. Unfortunately, [[nobody gives a shit|nobody gave a shit]] at the time, because all it could play were rudimentary versions of games like bowling and Breakout. In fact, all of the graphics consisted of little tiny black blocks. That would have been fine, except [[Tetris]] hadn't been invented yet.

Its saving grace was its customizable face-plates, which held the ROM chip to play the games. A makeup kit was included to make your face-plate look like a [[whore]]. There were only around ten games released for it, and it was ultimately discontinued a few years later before the company could come out with a black person face-plate.
