Pants on the ground
{{WP80}}
Pants on the Ground is an example of a [[meme]] that became an [[Old meme|old meme]] simultaneously with its creation. In fact, the Pants on the Ground meme propagated itself so quickly that it was actually [[Unfunny|unfunny]] before it was [[The_Holocaust|funny]], creating a [[Time_paradox|pime taradox]]. It began when most [[black people]] started to turn to [[rap]] instead of activism. During season 9 of [[American_Idol|American Idol]] when General Larry Platt, a 62 year old activist bravely stood up to the world and made a song trolling every rapper with the song 'Pants on the Ground'. Despite it being unfunny, successful troll is successful.

Soon after that, this song being a anthem for every fucking [[wigger]] out there, and they sing it  all the time in public places such as [[Ghetto|Black neigborhoods]] and [[KFC]] thinking it makes them look black person, but they fail epically.

<pre>Pants on the ground
Pants on the ground
Lookin’ like a fool with your pants on the ground
With the gold in your mouth
Hat turned sideways, pants hit the ground
Call yourself a cool cat looking like a fool
Walkin' down town with your pants on the ground
get it up!!
HEY! got your pants off the ground
lookin like a fool, walkin talking
with your pants on the ground
get it up
hey get them pants off the ground
Lookin’ like a fool with your pants on the ground
Gold in your mouth
Hat turned sideways, pants hit the ground
Call yourself a cool cat looking like a fool
Lookin’ like a fool with your pants on the ground

Much like viruses, as memes move from host to host, they mutate to fit their environment and get worse with every iteration.
