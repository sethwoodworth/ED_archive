'''Mario''' is the [[fat]], greasy, [[wop]] mascot for [[Nintendo]] and has starred in many [[Over 9000|(roughly 90%)]] of their games due to Shigeru Miyamoto's incurable shroom fetish. Mario is also known to be large in the [[furry]] community.  Mario is well known throughout the world for his habbit of breaking blocks, collecting coins, throwing fire balls, getting high off shrooms, getting pwned by turtles, saving whores, and [[goatse]]. Mario was the CEO of [[User:Timvim/Telstra|Telstra]] until acquitted by the corrupt [[John Howard]], he made away with $44million. Also, [http://kotaku.com/5381520/live+action-mario-dead-at-76| Mario died]. MARIO IS A FAT CUNT AND PEOPLE DONT LIKE HIM... YOU DONT LIKE WHAT IM SAYING? THEN YOU ARE A FAGGOT...

[[Image:Super-mario-compact-disco.jpg|thumb|Ginzo's are a lot like [[Niggers|niggers]] I guess.]]

==='''Donkey Kong'''===
[[File:I don't even know how this happened.png|left|thumbnail|250px|Wiki agrees.]]
[[Lie|Totally not related to King Kong in anyway]], this game has <s>Mario</s> [[Megaman|JUMPMAN]] saving the [[Fail|helpless]] Pauline from [[Rape|the clutches]] of a [[ronery]] black person.

===Super Mario Bros.===
Mario and his brother [[Weegee|Luigi]] save the Princess from a giant turtle. To [[AIDS|aid]] them on their quest, they have a variety of power-ups, such as flowers (which cause flames to erupt from Mario's fingertips), shrooms (which make everything look smaller), and stars (which cause enemies to <s>sieze</s> (seize, lrn2english) on contact.  I wish I was joking, but this is the staple of the average Mario game.

<center>Here's what happens when WE eat shrooms.</center>
<center><youtube>in6RZzdGki8</youtube></center>

===Super Mario Bros 2===
Mario, Luigi, that fucking annoying mushroom-midget thing, and that whore Peach who does nothing but scream and fly around using her ability to queef at high speeds, team up to battle a frog. They [[Kill it with fire| kill it with vegetables]], but not really, because [[spoiler|IT WAS ALL A DREAM LOL!]]

It's a [[cuntpaste|cuntpasted]] version of another game called ''Doki Doki Panic''. The original sequel was thought to be too hard for dumbass [[You|American]] [[Fail|gamers]] like yourself.

===Dian Shi Ma Li===

[[Image:Fortran.png|thumb|PUSH START TO RICH]]
[[File:Mario for Fingers.jpg|thumb|right|Of course,  Mario isn't for everyone...]]

A <s>pirate game</s> superior game compared to the main games of the series, [[Chinese|Dian Shi Ma Li]] is a spinoff featuring a Mario clone named [[4chan|Fortran]] - who happens to be the illegitimate father of Weegee and Malleo. The purpose of this game is to use imaginary moneys and to [[Engrish|PUSH START TO RICH]]. Unlike the other Mario games, there is no end to this one. Ever.

It's a shame that this particularly [[awesome]] Mario game was overshadowed by another, shittier one.

===Super Mario Bros. 3===
Considered by the fandom to be the BEST GAME EVAR, Mario and Luigi have to save seven kings who, along with being kidnapped, had their seven [[cock|MAGIK WANDS]] stolen and were turned into [[furry|animals]] by each of the seven black person However, in [[at least 100|World Seven]], Mario finds out that those seven [[rape|kidnappings]] were ''all just a distraction'' so Bowser could nab [[Madeleine McCann|Princess Toad]][[shit]]. Seven seven seven.

Bowser isn't the brightest bulb in the [[Ass|box]], but he at least deserves a Gold Star for effort... That is until you see what faggotty plans Bowser comes up with in the future. Then it's torn off like an old Band-Aid.

===Super Mario World===
The same game as ''3'', but for the [[Super Nintendo]]. The only difference is that this time you get to ride a dinosaur named Yoshi AND [[Shit nobody cares about|OMG YOU GET A CAPE INSTEAD OF A TAIL!1]]
<youtube>xt2uyDqbA-Q</youtube>
[[Image:Nigga stole my yoshi.gif|thumb|Nigga stole my Yoshi!]]
[[Image:SMW secret level.JPG|thumb|OMG SECRET LEVEL]]

===Mario Kart===
[[Image:Mario-jeremy.jpg|thumb|left|Luigi finds out that his brother is actually [[Ron Jeremy]].]]
Mario and his friends skid around various tracks in cardboard go-karts and throw shit at each other for [[You win the prize|trophies]]. The original was supposed to have [[2girls1cup|two female characters and one cup]], but Nintendo decided they were too badass for more than one chick. There have been sequels, but it's the same general concept of Mario and his friends throwing shit at each other.

===Super Mario RPG===
By far, the most overrated Mario game to date. The starting plot is the same as ''SMB 1'' but then this giant [[Cock|Sword]] rams into Bowser's crib and his shit goes flying everywhere and he has to hire an army of Mexicans to fix it.

So, Mario has to find some PVC glue bottles that look like bits of stars to reassemble some retarded magical dildo or some shit like that and look for the Princess. It's like ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' (it was made by the same company, go figure), but HE KNOWS ABOUT TIMED HITS which can be used for [[Massive damage| MASSIVE DAMAGE]]. This game has spawned an ungodly amount of fanboys who practically live on praying to their God for giving them this game. Let's not forget that this game is incredibly boring since Mario can only jump in the overworld and that the puzzelda were practically made <s>for</s> by three year-olds or people with down syndrome. Also the source of Geno, who is a fucking living puppet, and Mallow, but nobody cares about him.

===Mario is Missing===

Bowser is up to no good again, so Mario must put a stop to his evil [[Sex|deeds]]!!!!111[[Oneoneone]]. 

What poorly-made plan has Bowser cooked up this time to steal the Princess? None. Thank God.

Instead, Bowser has set up base in the Antarctic and he plans to flood the Earth by melting it with ''hairdryers'' (yes, you read that correctly. Unless you read it as Hard Drivers, in which case, get some glasses you blind black person). When Mario tries to stop Bowser's <s>hilarious</s> nefarious scheme, he gets his ass caught. Luigi then has to travel around the world and answer trivia questions to save his brother. It's exactly as entertaining as it sounds.

Melting Antarctica with ''hairdryers''? Bowser must be a cheap-ass black person. 

The PC version of the game gave birth to the [[meme]] known as [[Weegee]].

===Super Mario [[69]]===
You get a sexy letter from princess peach and she says some shit about cake. At this point you should know that the cake is a lie because women can't write letters. Bowser takes over the Princess's castle (which is nothing but an art gallery) and hides Power Stars in various painting worlds instead of actually doing anything with them. In this AMAZING 64 BIT (which just boils down to low poly low tris shit that was on the computer for years) [[Adventure Time|ADVENTURE]], you run around collecting the Power Stars that, coincidentally, do nothing but let you progress, and fight Bowser [[at least 69]] times (each battle the fucking same thing which becomes way too easy). The excellent control scheme handles like [[bitch|your mom]].

===Paper Mario===
Same as ''SMRPG'' but every character is a fucking piece of paper. Bowser steals a Star Rod, gets sued by [[Kirby]] for copyright infringement, wins, and decides to use it for himself. Peach invites Mario and Luigi to a party at the castle, during which the whole castle rises up in the sky and Bowser [[pwns]] the shit out of Mario with his Star [[Penis|Rod]]. OMFG! So now Mario has to free some shit star spirits to re-own Bowser and his damn Star Rod, with the help of all his partners. He has several of these partners to help him out on his contrived quest, but they are hardly notable and very shitty.  The series has also spawned two equally formulaic sequels of collecting seven shiny pieces of shit to kill somebody. Hooray!

===[[Super Smash Bros.]]===

[[Image:Japanstache.gif|thumb|If you play ''Mario'' games, you instantly become a dirty Italian.]]
[[Image:Mariots.gif|thumb|[[Goatse|Goatse 64]] - Wait, how did he pull his overalls down like that?]]
A Nintendo [[fanboy]]'s wet dream come to life. The game is basically a giant [[circlejerk]] of various Nintendo characters beating the shit out of each other. So, essentially, it's fucking [[fail|awesome]]. It's also [[at least 100|one of the many]] games subject to [[tourneyfag]] drama.

===Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door===
The world is once again turned into [[shit|paper]], and now it's up to Mario to go collect OMFGJESUSCHRIST [[Moar|EVEN MORE!!!!!!!]] fucking Stars. [[Obvious|That's right, and seven of them!]] Who would've thought? But there's a twist: You can die in the overworld! OMG!!! Nintendo is really pushing the limits! There's also a fucking guy with a fishbowl for a head who wants them so he can stick em up his ass or some other form of faggotry like that. Of course, Mario also has [[Life_partner|his bitches]] that join him, because apparently Mario's too [[fail|hippy]] to kick ass without help. Mario's [[Life_partner|bitches]], in this game, are all Aboriginal...let's see...

* [[Whore|Goombella]], a PMS-ing, Useless, excessive, and unwanted bitch.
* [[Fag|Koops]], a pussy. 
* [[Fat|Flurrie]], a nudist. And attractive women are NEVER nudist, are they? No, it's always the big fat fucking [[lolcow|cows]]. Unfortunately for Mario, she wants inside his pants.
* A [[Shota|Yoshi]], whom you get to name after you get him. Acts like a [[W|total douche]] the entire game.
* [[Trap|Vivian]], a prostitute-like shadow-freaky lady who wants inside Mario's pants. [[lol wut|But in Japan she's a boy.]]
* [[Pedophile|Captain Bobbery]], an old pedophile who [[Auto-fellatio|blows himself]] <s>up</s>, and is [[An Hero|emo]] for his dead wife. He desperately wants to die.PROTIP:This is the only character you will use in this game
* [[Furry|Ms. Mowz]], a random convict who wants inside Mario's pants.

Yes, every [[whore|female]] (and possibly [[Gay|male]]) wants inside Mario's pants, desperately (cause Italians are smexy :3). This fact is made painfully obvious throughout the game.

===Super Mario Blows Sunshine Up Your Ass===

Set shortly after Mario's successful [[Islam|Jihad]] in ''Super Mario World'' where he destroys several buildings, Mario boards a plane headed to a distant tropical island where he attempts to hijack and crash it into a high-rise skyscraper. With Mario's [[Final solution|final terrorist plot]] foiled, he is captured and labeled an [[Terrorist|enemy combatant]] and sent to [[Mexico|Guantanamo Bay]]. The rest of the game is spent with Mario being [[Raped|interrogated]] by eating cock-meat sandwiches and getting asshamered by [[The_Man|the Man]]. During his testimony, when asked why he intended to kill so many [[Asking_for_it|innocent civilians]], he stated that he "[[Did_it_for_the_lulz|did it for teh lulz!]]"

After being tortured half to death by freaks, Mario is subjected to [[At least 100 years ago|at least 100]] hours of community service in the form of cleaning up the town that the residents shit all over. Mario gets a [[penis|water cannon]] and uses it to [[cum|spray]] on everything [[porn|dirty]].

===s<u>U</u>pe<u>R</u> <u>M</u>a<u>R</u>io <u>G</u>al<u>A</u>x<u>Y</u>===
[[File:Rosalina.png|thumb|right|[[Lie|Easter egg in Super Mario Galaxy]].]]
[[Image:Mario rape yoshi.jpg|thumb|right|Mario [[buttsex|ass-fucks]] Yoshi and fills him with [[cum]], as Yoshi spits it out on the other end.]]

Waggle and jump around on tiny space-rocks, following a linear path to the star, jumping around on cartoony levels to appeal to the younger crowds.

...that's it. Going from point A to point B [[over 9000|9,003]] times, occasionally stopping to collect shit or take part in <s>epic</s> tedious boss fights.

After collecting all 120 stars, what do you get? YOU GET TO DO IT ALL AGAIN! But as [[Weegee]], who jumps higher but seems to have had his shoes dunked in anal lube, which makes him slippery as fuck. What do you get after beating the game again? You get to go back to the starting level of the game and collect purple coins! Fuck yes!

If you look closely at the title look at the letters that have stars. they spell out "U R MR GAY" lol

[[Lie|Easily the best ''Mario'' game ever made.]] Because of this and the fact that ever since [[astronaut|Neil Armstrong]] landed on the [[Moon]], every [[Americunt]] got a space [[fetish]], there's a sequel that appeals to [[at least 100]] percent of [[nostalgia]]fags and rips off every other 3D Mario game [[No|SINCE NOSTALGIA'S COOL, RIGHT?]]. Yoshi's in this one and eats radioactive berries that give it superpowers. And its cover says "YA I M R U?"

===Mario & [[Sonic]] at the [[LOLympic Games|Special Olympics]]===

[[Image:Marioporn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rule 34|No exceptions.]]]]

[[Image:SpecialOlympics.jpg|thumb|right|]]



Mario and his friends find some [[furfags]] and a fat scientist, and then they compete in the fucking Special Olympics. Nobody gives a shit about this game now, due to Sonic in ''Brawl''- [[wut|HOLY SHIT! THOSE BASTARDS ARE MAKING ANOTHER ONE!]]

===Super Paper Mario===
Same old [[shit|story]] as the first two, except in this game, Mario gets partners that aren't necessarily gay, but they aren't heterosexual either. This time around, he gets to team up with [[Cutter|Tippi]], [[Lesbian|Princess Peach]], [[Weegee|Luigi]], and [[Troll|Bowser]]. Together, they fight [[Emo|Count Bleck]], [[Basement Dweller|Nastasia]], [[Chuck Norris|O'Chunks]], [[Whore|Mimi]], [[Fag|Dimentio]], and [[ZA WARUDO|Mr. L]]. It's different from the other two ''Paper Mario'' games in that there's less turnbased combat and more of the [[No U|awesome]] platforming. 

Instead of Mario's, most of the [[whore|female]] characters go for [[emo|Count Bleck]]'s pants since he's the supreme god of all emos. Bleck also [[epic fail|doesn't succeed in destroying the universe]] and reveals the power of [[buttsecks|friendship]].

===New Super Mario Bros===
It's like every other 2D ''Mario'' game, but [[noob|new]]! There's also this [[fail|little]] version of Bowser that you fight [[OVER 9,000]] times who sounds like [[you]].

As quoted from Luigi, "Go, [[Weegee]]!"

===[[copypasta|New Super Mario Bros.Wii]]===
So its Mario's bitch's Birthday and a HUEG [[Delicious Cake|cake]] comes in from nowhere, everyone is pleased at the arrival of the cake but then.....[[Typical|Bowser's Kids]] come out of nowhere and put the whore in the cake and take off with it! It all boils down to a [[lemonparty]] of all the old 2D games, but in [[lie|3D]]!

===Mario & Luigi:Superstar Saga===
This time, instead of the Mushroom Kingdom being in peril, the [[Beaners|Beanish]] people of the [[Mexico|BeanBean]] Kingdom ask [[Wops|Mario and Luigi]] to stop [[Batshit Insane|Cackletta]], [[Nerd|Fawful]], and the Koopalings from terrorizing the BeanBean Kingdom. [[Shit nobody cares about|In this game, the battle system is exactly the same as Paper Mario, except you can do combos and Bros Attacks.]]

It has sequels on the [[DS]] that include [[time]] travel and [[vore]]. [[O RLY|Ya, rly.]]

===Other Games===
Keep in mind, the above mentioned games only make up a small percentage of the games in which Mario has starred. Mario has also been featured in [[at least 100]] other games (no exaggeration), all of which can be viewed [[Shit nobody cares about|here]].

==Furry== 
In 1990, the public was beginning to suspect Mario of being part of the [[furry]] community.  Mario denied these claims when asked.  These suspicions were brought on by the fact that Mario was seen dressing up like a raccoon.  Mario stated that he wore this costume not because he was a furry, but because he liked being able to float around and get more coins.  However, suspicions were further aroused when he was also caught dressing up like a tanuki and later, a frog.  When asked, Mario just stated that he was sort of a furry, but only in that he was fascinated by those creatures and was not aroused by them at all.  These rumors went away after a while, but then they were brought back and confirmed when an anonymous source noticed that Yoshi, the dinosaur that Mario rode around, wore shoes.   A picture was then found of someone who followed Yoshi to his house and discovered that Yoshi was actually a fat furry dressing up like a dinosaur.  Mario said that he didn't realize that he was riding another man, but eventually Peach came out and stated to the press that Mario really was a furry.  Mario then cried and threatened to kill himself.  After disappearing for many years, Mario returned to the public accepting that he was a furry.  Mario has since been seen at many furry conventions dressed as a penguin with overalls.  He has yet been banned from Deviantart 4 times.  

==IT'S WAR!==
During the 90's, Mario gained competiton as Sega introduced their newest mascot, [[Sonic]] the Hedgehog. [[Shit no one cares about|The game proved to be popular and resulted in many lulz.  Nintendo had the SNES and Sega had the Genesis, basement dwellers and fanboys on both sides droped their cum stained controllers to bitch at which was better. This soon became the Great Console Wars of the 90's]]. This was a war that was [[over 9000]] better than WW2. The stage is set between two companies in a [[shoop the woop]] of oil, [[period|blood]], 16 bit, name calling, plastic, shrapnel, [[fire]], [[rings]], [[coins]], [[sex scandals]], extortion, and [[jizz]]. Yet in 2001, SEGA found themselves kissing Nintendo's ass after they dropped out of the hardware business due to a little scuffle with SONY. Sonic is now played on all platforms, shamed by his transition to multi platform. In the end, Sonic got his revenge while being invited to participate in and confirmed for Super Smash Brothers Brawl. While his venture to Nintendo, Sonic has beaten the shit out of Mario's fat wop dego ass, stold his coins, [[murder|killed Luigi]], and has [[threesome]] with Peach and Daisy possibly getting them [[pregnant]] ,all for the [[lulz]]. At the cost of never making a good game again.

===Mario LSD gallery===
Created [[last thursday]] by an [[Chris-chan|autistic]] [[lolicon|6-year old girl]] with [[asperger's syndrome]], the mario drawings are a series of crappy pictures that were stolen off some russian website. [[Some argue]] the source to be untrue, but it doesn't fucking matter. Every once in a while, a random spider expert will start a new topic in [[/b/]] asking for "those mario drawings" so he can appreciate his LSD trip better while his dad jerks him off. Enjoy.
