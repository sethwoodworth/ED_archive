'''Gmask''' is a program that magically converts, or "masks", [[Not4chan|Lolikon]] images to assist [[Retard|technically unsavvy computer users]] who don't know how to use a [[Darknet]] or PGP to post [[Yaoi|gay furry porn]] on [[4chan]]. The program was originally written in 1984 for [[Windows]] 1.0. Subsequently, bootleg copies of Windows 1.0 account for nearly half the traffic on [[KaZaA]].

Ohhh shiiit, as of May 2008, Gmask has made an [[xbox|XBOX]] HUEG resurgence in /b/.

==How to Gmask==

Some [[Retard|technically unsavvy computer users]] don't know how to Gmask and their sole reason for not yet becoming [[an hero]] is that there are some [[cp|canned peaches]] behind the gmasked image they found on [[niggertits|4chan]], so [[you|they]] come to ED seeking [[Nobody gives a shit|help]].

'''To Gmask an image'''
# Drag a box over the area you want to mask
# Press random buttons at the top
# ???
# Profit

'''To UnGmask an image'''
# Highlight the exact area of the mask
# Do whatever was done to the image in the reverse order, with the exception of M- and M+ which you need to do the opposite mask for.  So if M+ was used to mask, M- is used to unmask.

'''Whatever the fuck you do, stay away from the CP button.'''  CP masks are based on a password you enter to make them, and you need that password to unmask them.  So you cannot unmask the image without the password.  Not fun.

In the below example, highlight the exact area of the mask, then press M-, then FL.
