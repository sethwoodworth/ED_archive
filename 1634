The Closing Logos Wiki is a community of [[faggots]], [[pussies]] and occasionally some [[furries]] who devote their entire life to searching for Closing Logos, begging their parents for DVDs to put them on, and upload the [[shit]] to the internet.

==History==

The Closing Logos Wiki was started in 1999 in a newsgroup by a group of pussies who were scared by [[Viacom]] logos but soon found out there was no place to whine about it. So they decided to piss their pants and look for more logos and were pissed if they did not include old logos on broadcasts of the shows. Later when they got enough money from sucking cocks, they had enough money for a real website, and then thy fapped to [[Guinea Pig]] films.
