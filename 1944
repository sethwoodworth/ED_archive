D. Omen
{{cleanup}}
[[Image:Domen jeopardy.jpg|thumb|200px|The question was rigged]]
'''D. Omen''' (affectionately referred to as ''DoMen'') slowly crawled over to [[RapMusic.com|RapeMusic.com]] sometime before the Winter of 2006 (for hibernation reasons) and began to write up a webazine about the site.  He claimed that he was a [[wigger|Blood]], that he rapped better than [[wigger|Papoose]], and released audio tracks of [[wigger|total fucking garbage]].  Since his neckchin naturally retracts only in the presence of food, he couldn't control his jaw properly during recording, resulting in D. Omen being horridly off-beat from the hunger shivers.  This condition causes his rapping, his adlibs, his backups, his breathing, and even the beat he is rapping over to be completely off-beat. In spite of this fail, he kept acting arrogant and overconfident, which only made the inevitable sonnage worse.

Soon after, he started posting pictures of himself on the site.  With his glorious chunkedness exposed, the crowd reacted with many lulz.  To recover from this humiliating defeat, DoMen revealed his internet emcee career's biggest secret: ''He was about to release a track he was working on with Twista.  '''Yes, Twista from Slow Jamz.'''''


==DoMen Vs. The World==
*'''Combatants''': DoMen, Wargasms, ThaMessiah, Nimrod, Mesk, Enef, Cire, every-fucking-one.<br>
*'''Weapons''': MySpace Logs, PhotoShop, AIM Logs, Forum logs, Screenshots, the kitchen sink<br>
*'''Outcome''': ThaMessiah almost loses his job and DoMen is officially kill on sight.<br><br>

A few people began to call his bluff and started asking questions about the deal, and D. Omen struggled to lie his way through it all.  Eventually, it was determined that the Twister he was talking about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_%28pastry%29 was the delicious pastry snack] that he was using as a mic mount.

Without missing a beat, members started deconstructing the entire D. Omen empire one lie at a time.  He got exposed for the <strike>pimp</strike> obsessed nerd that he was on numerous dating sites (scoring [[pedobear|underage]] [[loli]], no doubt), specifically telling Indian girls he was Guyanese.  (Which is not true because DoMen is white)  Screenshots were dropped, and hundreds of pages of lulz followed.  When people from the dating sites came to RM.com to partake in the laughter, the cumulative exposure was just too much for the planet.  D. Omen scrambled desperately to remove his posts, but the damage was already done.  ThaMessiah got a hold of a few of them and [[for_the_lulz|shopped the shit out of them]].  D. Omen's illustrious net career was completely and totally destroyed.

D. Omen swore an oath to the Heavens to get back at ThaMessiah for his efforts and began sending emails to ThaMessiah's job about what happened.  For a moment, D. Omen's attack broke through the lines and it appeared he had make a comeback.  But ThaMessiah did the impossible and performed a brilliant tactic: ''he had a moderator delete everything ThaMessiah had ever posted on [[RapMusic.com|RM.com]]''.  DoMen was defeated on November 7th, 2007 and surrendered, never returning again.

This is a video by D.Omen called "Trapped in the AIM box". It's meant to be a parody, but it aptly describes his life:

==At the RM Meet==
There was a real life RM meetup in Baltimore in 2007 which D.Omen attended. They hung out, went to a rap show, and stayed the night at Omens house (no homo?) Throughout the event, D Omen was getting served like all those IHOP pancakes that he ate. Some notable quotations:
*''"A drunk mind speaks the sober truth, and this man right here (puts arm around Omen) is the LAMEST NIGGA I KNOW! No question."''' -Skrybeminds'''
*''"You look like a truck driver nigga"''' -Nimrod'''
*''"FILM THAT NIGGA YO!"''' -Nimrod'''
*''"Why you shaped like a snowman nigga? It's like, stomach, chest, head"''' - Nimrod'''
*''"This aint no hood nigga"''' -Nimrod in Domens house, in response to Domen introducing his place as "the hood"'''
*''"RRAAAAAAAHHHHHH"''' -Everyone, whenever someone said Domens name'''


Skrybe later made an excellent post on the forums-

''"Nigga you begged us to stay at your crib...lol. You just bought your first pair of jordans like two weeks ago nigga... you had the audacity to record yourself saying "im special..I wear TEAM Jordans" and you want to question whats in my pockets? Nigga tell me this...we going to hotels...we already told you good night...why the fuck was you still following us around? Nigga sittin at the hotel in his volvo wagon talking bout "see guys thats why you need to just stay at my house...my mommy said we can smoke weed and everything!!" Now he done run out of shit to say so he want to flip the script...lol.  You can tell this nigga gay son...we all downstairs chillin...this nigga comes down stairs in a extra large tee shirt lookin the fuck pregnant with some smedium sized boxers on...nigga had slimfit tapered boxers on and he prancing around in a basement full of dudes fully dressed. Nigga called us up crying the next morning on some "aww man you guys left already? whered you go I can get dressed and meet you" You a fraud nigga...you fraudulent...vibes paid for your pancakes you extra large buttery strawberry syrup on a short stack ass nigga. If i was so broke, why was i buying your broke ass drinks in the club? Why did niggaz have to pay your cover charge? Why did vibe have to pay for your gas when we all stopped to fill up you clown ass nigga?"''


and it gets harsher...


''"Son the whole shit was about you...we clowned you on purpose cuz A) your a lame and nobody liked you and B) cuz your a clown and nobody liked you. The only reason why we even "pretended" we were just jokin is cuz we didnt want to look like assholes to everybody else. Nigga we were clowning on you from the minute we saw you standing outside Fridays. We was clowning on your shoes and you was poppin off at the mouth thinkin them ran down pieces of shit was hot. We were clownin on your shitty ass volvo granny wagon in the parking lot before we left the mall. You were the butt of our jokes nigga. We in the bar and random motherfuckers were laughin at your dumbass...you thinking they was complimenting you on your dusty ass sleepy necked t-shirt and them same people would walk up to one of us like "yo is this nigga serious with that t-shirt on?"

''"Niggas was laughin at you to your face and you thought it was all fun and games...NO NIGGA WE WERE LAUGHING AT YOU. Look at nimrod face in the pictures...its a reason why your cypher wasnt on the video...its a reason why Bad Abbot gave you the lullabye beat in the parking lot, its a reason nimrod got the shitface on everytime you jump into the pictures. You a joke son. Nigga we tried to ditch you after you got us lost, we tried to ditch you on charles st at the bars cuz we knew you couldnt get in...The only reason you didnt get totally shitted on and left behind is because Vibe was with you and we didnt want him to have a bad time cuz he flew way the fuck out there to kick it. We didnt want you around son. If a fight had jumped off we woulda let you get stomped the fuck out without intervening. We had no respect for you. "

''"Your a loser and a joke. We tried to spare your feelings cuz we felt bad about taking advantage of a fucking outcast loser and you got all gassed up and shit so Imma say whats real. IT AINT NO TWO SIDES TO THEM VIDEOS...OMEN GOT HOED IN EACH ONE CUZ THATS HOW WE DID HIM THE WHOLE TRIP!"

''"Nigga talkin about he a blood and he so hardbody but he got a dog named Snoodles... Nigga you dont even have fuckin cable. We in this motherfuckers basement and he turn the tv on and its a fuzzed out weather channel and that was the only station. Fuck out my face you clown ass nigga."'' -[http://board.rapmusic.com/rapmusics-hall-shame/1033426-fuck-every-last-one-you-11.html#post14413448 Skrybeminds]
