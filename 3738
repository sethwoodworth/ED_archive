Hollywood Undead

Hollywood Undead is a [[scene|scenefag]], [[wigger]], [[poser]], etc. band from [[Hollywood]], [[California]]. This band thought it would be cool to fuse [[Techno|the shittiest music ever created]] together with [[rap|that Jiggaboo stuff]] and attempt to promote the abomination on [[MySpace]]. While under different circumstances, this would have made them the butt of the biggest joke in the music industry since its inception, they caught the attention of a bunch of [[Emo]] faggots and other [[16 year old girl|MySpace idiots]], and [[some argue|theoretically]] created the [[Crunkcore]] genre. This band later developed a cult following of some of the dumbest [[retards]] to ever walk the face of the earth since [[Juggalos]] and [[Goths]]. The worst part is that their fans are raised in the suburbs - black person are from the ghetto, and [[heavy metal|metalheads]] hate Emo-and-Scenefags, thereby inciting riots during their first [[Orgy|concerts]] in Hollywood. Still, [[faggots]] liked their music, and they seem to actually think their music is fresh and exciting, disregarding the fact that it ([[Slipknot|and the gimmicky mask wearing bullshit]]) would've been cliche [[at least 100 years ago]].

The most ironic part of all of this being that they "started" as a band trolling their current Emo fanbase with the aptly-titled, [[Meme|"I Must Be Emo"]], but their [[faggot|fanbase]] denies it because they wouldn't want to think of their [[BrokeNCYDE|favorite bands trolling them]]. They would claim it was made by some group called "Adam and Andrew" or some-such, but the massive butthurt instigated by continuing to call it a Hollywood Undead classic on lyrics websites and YouTube makes the validity irrelevant anyway - though yes, Hollywood Undead totally made the fucking song.

Hollywood Undead's lyrical content rivals [[Paris Hilton]], containing some of the most materialistic and superficial (typical [[Americunt]]) bullshit [[basement dwellers]] the world over wish they were out participating in, such as [[sex|fornicating]] with a bunch of sluts who probably have [[AIDS]], gettin' drunk in da club, fake ID's, and other similar shit we've already heard 100 times from other bands and rappers who at least had a modicum of talent.

|I think they wear masks to hide the fact they're probably ex-members of Crazy Town
and Alien Ant Farm.|Trashy
|Good beat, good sound...
Lyrically though its pathetic...it sounds like something a year 12 old wrote on the way to school. Awful.
I understand its only meant to be 'party music', and fair enough, but when you've got kids putting this band on a pedastool and telling you that they represent all the hard times they've been through, the "party" argument doesnt really have any substance. I have nothing against the band, i just dont like the lyrics.
Im just giving my opinion.|Roodie
|The fact that this gimmicky, flavor of the year group is headlining over Senses Fail is an absolute joke. Undead says they almost died for this music, yikes [[Lulz|I don't think that sitting on your butt and friending people on myspace is that dangerous...]]|ToWhatEnd

== Band Members ==
[[Faggot|Charlie Scene]] - wigger with the fake bandanna (Probably from a [[Hot Topic|mallcore]] store) and shitty baseball cap failing at being a [[beaner]], and sucks at rapping making [[John Cena]] one of the greatest rappers alive .<br />
[[Wigger|J-Dog]] - Jason Vorhees coming out of the closet. <br />
[[Wigger|Da Kurlzz]] - If Anonymous and that guy from Phantom of the Opera had a baby together and got their masks painted by [[lolis]], this is what makes up for this mask made of fail and faggotry.<br />
[[Unfunny|Funny Man]] - moar liek Unfunny Man.<br />
[[Nobody cares|Johnny 3 Tears]] - Same shit as Deuce, but replace Juggalo with [[Jeffree Star|hanging with trannies]].<br />
<s>[[Faggot|Deuce]]</s> - Took the juggalo's style and decided to mix it with his own fail. Vocals sounds like a hybrid of [[Eminem]] and [[Miley Cyrus]]. Kicked from the band for probably wearing a Hatchetman hockey jersey.<br /> 
<s>[[An hero|Shady Jeff]]</s> - [[Pwned]] in a traffic accident.(It's been rumored that they kicked him out of the band because he wasn't tr00ly [[gay|scene]] enough.)
