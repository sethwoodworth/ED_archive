'''Seamonkey''' is a [[crap|"compelling integrated internet software suite"]], which was officially released December 19th, 2006. It is one of the most [[shit|complete]], [[stupid|amazing]], and [[fail|stable]] browsers in the history of forever. It was made by [[Mozilla]], the creators of [[Firefox]]. However, just because it is exactly as [[retarded|amazing]] as Firefox, that doesn't make it pointless OR repetitive. It is completely different in design and performance.

Most people liked it before when it was called [[Netscape|Netscape Communicator]].

==Amazing Abilities==
In Seamonkey, you can open any URL in a new tab, a new window, and even on the same page! The default is opening the URL in the '''same''' window. However, most of the time, it screws up and opens your page in a '''new''' [[spam|damn]] window. If you actually want to take the time with this browser to open your page the right way, go to File>Open Location and type/paste your URL into the text box. Then select the way you want to open it from the drop-down menu, and press the open button, or [[whatever|something]]. There is no guarantee that it will open in the style that you selected, but hey, at least you [[idiot|tried]].

==Why Use Seamonkey?==
In addition to the above information, it has a [[ugly|pleasing]] design, which consists of a File, Edit, View, Go, Bookmarks, Tools, Window, Help, Debug, and QA menu, [[chatzilla]], [[email]] client and some other pointless [[crap]]. Along with the menu, you can make [[Over 9000|endless amounts of custom folders]] to make your browsing experience much more [[lies|convenient and fast]]. Actually, those aren't valid reasons at all, so please, for the sake of your sanity and your [[computer]], [[Do not want|don't ever]] install this program.
