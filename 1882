Crystal Head Vodka is the magical alcoholic brainchild of [[batshit insane]] former-somebody Dan Aykroyd. After the [[failure]] of many [[IRL]] projects, including working for the Canadian Postal Service (admittedly, before he was a Blues Brother), narrating a shitty X-Files wannabe, owning a restaurant and a brave attempt at [[Electric Boogaloo|''Ghostbusters 3'']], good old Elwood Blues decided to market a vodka with a viral marketing campaign based on UFOs, magical crystal skulls and ancient Mexicans. No seriously, he did!

[[Mary Sue|Elwood Blues]] was born on July 1st 1952, thus making him [[Jay Stile|old and canadian]]. He suffers from a birth defect called syndactylism, which is an incredibly wierd affliction that fuses together fingers and toes. He was engaged to [[fap|Princess Leia]], admittedly an awesome achievement, but only if the gold bikini made regular guest appearances. Another awesome factette from their relationship surrounds the circumstances of his marriage proposal, detailed [http://www.healthyplace.com/bipolar-disorder/articles/carrie-fisher-and-manic-depression/menu-id-67/ here], buried amongst the [[TL;DR|heartbreaking]] details surrounding her [[Batshit|Bipolar]] Disorder. To cut a long story short: One night, according to Fisher, she was so high that her beloved forced her to eat, at which point she promptly choked on a Brussels sprout. After he performed the Heimlich Maneuvre, he proposed. This begs just one question. '''[[WTF|Who the fuck]] eats Brussels sprouts when they're stoned??'''

==The Legend of The 13 Crystal Skulls==
[[Image:Oldladycrystalskull.jpg|right|thumb|Too easy.]]

Okay, if you want to know all about the fucking insane legend of the crystal skulls, you're going to have to either wade through the billions of shitty [[interwebz]] regarding them, or watch the shitty ''Indiana Jones'' film based on it, then forget everything the film taught you and wade through the billions of shitty [[interwebz]] regarding them. Either way, the moral of the story is that there is nothing worth knowing about the legend of the 13 crystal skulls that a tidy little set of bullet points cannot teach you. Thus, see below.
[[Image:Hairyhippy.jpg|thumb|right|She believes. Do you?]]

* They were supposedly made by God or Aliens, and given to the Mexicans.
* It is theorised that they hold the sum of all human knowledge.
* They may or may not be from Atlantis.
* That is all.

There are thousands of incredibly interesting "[[lies|facts]]" floating around regarding these skulls, however, the vast majority are hysterical conjecture and not worthy of mention. Some of the more pseudo-scientific reasons given for the skulls being [[fail|ZOMG MAJ'ICK]] are as follows, along with a few home truths:
[[Image:crystalskull.jpg|right|thumb|Yeah, totally made by aliens.]]

<span style="color:red">'''Myth:'''</span> They contain a series of prisms that perfectly focus the light that shines through them, and they could not have been artificially inserted because man does not have the technology.

<span style="color:red">'''Fact:'''</span> Spectacle lenses often contain artificially manufactured prisms, and can, in fact, contain multiple prisms, of multiple strengths, facing in different directions. This is not new technology; ask anyone with a [[lol|lazy eye]], as prismic lenses are one of the main corrective measures.

<span style="color:red">'''Myth:'''</span> The skulls are carved against the grain of the crystal, and even modern laser cutters can't do that without the entire thing shattering into a billion pieces. Also, there are no tool marks on the skulls at all; they're perfectly smooth. It defies the laws of physics!

<span style="color:red">'''Fact:'''</span> If there are no tool marks on the skulls at all, then how exactly does anyone know whether they were carved in one direction or the other? The skulls were very highly polished, and a hand-buffed and polished piece of crystal is very unlikely to have tool marks on due to the fact that those processes are specifically designed to remove imperfections created during manufacture. Furthermore, these things are supposed to be thousands of years old, and many have been found in places open to the elements. One can safely assume erosion plays at least a small part in the silky smooth surface texture.

<span style="color:red">'''Myth:'''</span> The Mitchell-Hedges skull was found at an archeological dig site, and the jaw was found three months later. Despite the fact that the two had been seperated for possibly hundreds, or even thousands of years, when put together they formed an absolutely perfect working jaw mechanism.

<span style="color:red">'''Fact:'''</span> Mitchell-Hedges bought the skull at an auction in 1948. It was complete at the time of buying.

==The Genius==
[[Image:Jdcollection.jpg|right|thumb|Because tributes to alcoholism are very cool.]]

Alcohol is popular. Very popular, and it's the perfect medium in which to include gimmicks. Different brands and types of alcohol inherently create brand loyalty. Most bars stock a core range of Whiskey, Vodka, Rum, Gin, Spirit Blends and Cognac, and they're almost always in the most prominant position above or behind the bar. These core ranges are all pretty much uniform, because people like what they like. It's as simple as that. Do you know someone who collects [[Whiskey|Jack Daniels]] memorabilia? Exactly.<br/>Crystal Head Vodka has the ideal gimmick, and a multi-faceted one at that: Crystal Head Vodka bottles are really fucking cool, and nothing says "badass" like drinking hard liquor from a human head. They have set it apart from the crowd just with the bottle, but then comes the coup de grace: [[ALL CAPS|IT'S FUCKING MAGIC!]]<br/>Well, it's certainly ''paranormal''. Or something. The "magic" aspect of the drink is really just the bottle. It's triple filtered through diamonds (like Smirnoff), or specifically, [[fake|Herkimer]] Diamonds, and it's distilled with [[Canada|Newfoundland]] springwater, thus the vodka itself it truly unspectacular. Like all vodka it is just water mixed with ethanol (aka Everclear). However, the celebrity, legend and viral marketing campaign surrounding it made it an instant hit among [[you|stupid Americans]].

==The Inevitable Happens==
[[Image:Catconspiracy.jpg|right|thumb|Conspiracy theorists will conspire of all things]]

Like everything involving [[UFOs]] and relics with convoluted backstories, the conspiricy theorists inevitably stepped off the mothership and weighed in extensively on the matter. The word "ectoplasm" was used in the advert, and this was seen as a not-so-well-hidden message that ''Ghostbusters'' was somehow involved, rather than being seen in the way it was clearly intended: a tongue-in-cheek nod to his part in the films. The 8-minute-long viral ad and paranormal overtones led many to believe that the whole thing was nothing more than a plug for the third ''Ghostbusters'' film, of which there had long been rumours. Why a film destined for a huge budget would run a viral video with nothing but Dan Aykroyd standing behind a bar shouting at the camera in a rather fucking crazy manner is absolutely anyone's guess. Why a brand of vodka would inspire a mountain of conspiracy theories is also a good question, as well as a pretty accurate reflection of the attitude of many conspiracy lovers, who will make up a funny story about any old piece of shit. The fires were fueled by the fact that suppliers were apparently very hard to come by. However, a brief [[Google]] search proved this to be [[bullshit|spurious]]. Either way, it's safe to say that conspiracy theories are 100% wrong, 100% of the time.


The vodka is available, the [[batshit]] insane backstory is true, and Dan Aykroyd is a crazy motherfucker.
