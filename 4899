'''LittleKuriboh''' is a [[die_alone|God]] among [[internets]] due to his [[Unwarranted Self Importance|highly popular]] and [[shit|original]] ''Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series'', a series of webisodes which aim to retell the plot of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh]]'' without all the [[fail]] and [[AIDS]], but with more gay 4chan/internet references to be lol funny. Since its creation, YGOTAS has developed a [[Scientology|cult]] following and spawned [[Over 9000|over 9,000]] rip-offs, which are all relatively the same as the original YGOTAS, but with even worse voice acting.

{{quote|It’s pretty sad what LK has become. The guy has some decent enough chops that he could actually do something, but he’s become trapped by his own laziness, misery, and desperate need to be loved that he will lower himself to shit ... in order to get people to like him. It’s the same reason he was so obsessed with doing with con circuit, teaming up with Team 4Star, and sucking up to TGWTG. The breakdown of his marriage only made it worse and exposed him as the needy, sad person that is so plainly apparent in his videos now. He keeps doing these endless song parodies because it’s so much easier than having to come up with new material, since he painted himself into a corner on his own abridged series. There will never again be a season of YGO Abridged as moderately funny as the first one was.|QFT}}

==Just was is an Abridged Series?==
[[Image:Littlekuribohcard.jpg|thumb|This card can only be summoned by sacrificing Dan Green. Also note the [[ghetto|lovely neighborhood]] LK lives in.]]

As is well known, [[anime]] is hated by everyone but [[weeaboos]] for their ridiculous plots and retarded characters.

An abridged series attempts to rectify this by:

*[[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|Shortening]] the story so that it does not lose the attention of its [[retards|viewers]].  This was true for earlier episodes that ran about [[At Least 100|3 to 5]] minutes long.  Now, it's just a bunch of [[lolcats|internet memes]] with the occasional [[Family Guy|popular culture]] reference running for up to [[Over 9000|10]] minutes long.

*Remove the lame jokes, and replace them with lamer but moar [[South Park|edgy]] ones.  Make [[gay]] jokes as often as possible.

*Point out and occasionally avoid the idiotic choices of the characters.

*<strike>Generally [[Lies|improve the overall quality]] by removing anything remotely [[Japanese]].</strike>  Funnily enough, LittleKuriboh wants the world to know that he actually knows about Yu-Gi-Oh! and makes references to the Japanese version and how 4kids 'Ruined it'.

*Makes terrible "self-depreciating" jokes in order to hide your [[cock|massive, throbbing ego]] and to make your audience relate to you.  Common jokes include how you don't update regularly, how down-to-earth you are, and how people overrate you, despite not [[Final Solution|taking the appropriate action]] to shut them up once and for all.

[[Some argue]] that the best way to become an [[internet celebrity]] is to create an abridged series, as it takes little effort and even less talent (note: this is only true if you  mind being called a faggot and only because everyone will troll you with ease). As such, the internet has been flooded with crappy, half-assed [[shit]] which essentially plagiarizes everything which [[Lie|made YGOTAS unique]].

But why rely on ae when no other than '''DAN GREEN''' [[lie|himself]] taught the internet how to make an abridged series many years ago?

*'''PROTIP:''' Don't be a fool, foo. Don't make an abridged series, not even for the lolz.
*'''PROTIP#2:''' If you are [[nostalgiafag|actually tempted]] to watch one, stay away from any One Piece and Bleach abridged series. [[truth|They are all destined to suck nigger cock]].
*'''PROTIP#3:''' '''DAN GREEN''' is right. Being an internet celebrity is as meaningless as it sounds. '''DON'T DO ET FAGGOT.'''
*'''PROTIP#∞:''' [[truth|You've just seen every single episode from Yu Gi Oh TAS: Season 3 thanks to this video.]]

==JewTube Career==
LittleKuriboh's [[lie|hilarious]] comedic style, which is based on Carlos Mencia styled-humour, attracted much praise and many [[/b/tards]] back in the day. At first, the lulz were plentiful, if you were an [[Uncyclopedia]] user or a [[13 year old boy|13-year-old-boy]]. Then, after a four week break, LittleKuriboh realised that no matter what he posted on the interwebs, even if it took him aeons to actually post his videos, they would all receive the praise and attention at the level of any work made by Leonardo Da Vinci. Since then, the series became littered with Disney songs, [[YTMND]] memes, [[shit nobody cares about|obscure references]] and canceled Adult Swim shows. Needless to say it was the beginning of the descending to major suckage for the internet's favourite British anime redubber.
 
''This LittleKuriboh [[retard|fan]] is probably regretting posting his video on YT now that his testicles have finally dropped. Sucks to be him of course.''
<youtube>lmsDbDeU1gE</youtube>

Since late 2006, YouTube began a war on LittleKuriboh's supposed copyright infringement. Legions of armed interweb nerds fought loyally for their cheap laughs, while millions of cyber minions were manufactured. ''(Spoiler:'' LittleKuriboh regained his account on JewTube much to the [[jizz|happiness]] of his [[nerds|loyal minions]].) Despite all that, the battle goes on and on and on, which led to a predictabe pattern; LK gets banned, nerds rage, YT unbans him. Keep recylcing this for over four years. Recently both his old account and his new account are unbanned as of late. LittleKuriboh seems to be fond of making references to how his videos were flagged, specifically by [[trolls]], who apparently were ALL from [[4chan]] (NO EXCEPTIONS) as he portrayed them as saying that [[truth|the shows sucks]] ever since he started making [[tl;dr|longer episodes]], even though [[truth|it always sucked]].

Update: As of Janurary 2011, LittleKuriboh's account has been banned and unbanned again for the usual reason; copyright infringement. Only this time, it wasn't YT or 4Kids who were demanding Ed Woo- Little Kuriboh's British ass getting banhammered, but an obscure Japanese company that ironically nobody cares about. Till now his main account is still as active as a snail, as to celebrate the unbanning of his account (yes you read that right) he celebrates that through; you'll never guess it- '''[[KILL IT WITH FIRE|THROUGH SONG]]'''!

''No, seriously, he actually says "Let's celebrate with a new song!" in the video. Because if there is anything LK doesn't do enough, is fucking sing a song.''

==Beyond Good and JewTube==
[[Image:shitsux111.jpg|thumb|Which translates to: Screw the EFFORT I've got stupid fans who fork out CASH! P.S You're a tool.]]

During his on again off again relationship with JewTube LittleKuriboh rounded up some of his [[Fantard|friends]] back in 2007 in order to host his ''Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series'' episodes from their own domain. Now making use of [[Google]] [[Advertising|Adsense]], it was now possible for LittleKuriboh to make a profit off of his shit series and off his fans with their delicious fat wallets full of buttloads of easy cash. The forum itself has literally [[over 9,000]] registered members, but who cares anyway. A smaller, but lesser form of profit comes from the shirts he sells, [[Google|demonstrating that there is money to be made on the internets]]. As long as you're not a [[megatokyo|whiny weeaboo]] who does [[lol wut|the exact same thing]] with his own retarded [[wapanese|fans]], except that the prices for ''his'' T-shirts are ridiculously overpriced in comparasion, thus making LittleKuriboh [[hypocrite|infinitely  superiour]].

''It's kinda sad that LK is unintentionally better than [[Linkara|the supposed "talent"]] at reviewing comics.''

<youtube>TNKW-UEk-q0</youtube> 

To get [[moar]] views, LK became affiliated with [[TGWTG|ThatGuyWithTheGlasses]] and now whores out the work of other members of the site in more recent videos. Also, [[Asshole|SidBastard]], the [[Shit nobody cares about|co-owner of the server]], has since [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|decided it is his place]] to order people around much like a [[Nazi]] or a [[Democrat]]. He often goes by the name of [[Magick]], as he thinks he is [[1337]].  He is actually a [[Hippy]] in disguise. He [[Tax|overly taxes]] his fellow server owners, and black person.

[[Image:PlushieDoom logo.png|left]]












Little Kuriboh is now diverting his time to work on a Deviant Art web comic.  The comic entitled 'Plushie Doom' is about an office worker in desperate need of porn who joins a cult. He also has a plushie, just like all normal people, much less <s>office workers</s> anyone with a job, which seems to be linked to the cult. The main character is based strongly off of [[USI|Little Kuriboh's actual appearance]] despite lacking the recently <s>acquired</s> discarded beard, cause you know, everyone loves him! The web comic contains ten pages as of yet.

==Divorce==

LK divorced his [[loli|deliciously flat chested]] [[stalker|wife]], Safty. That's what happens when you propose on JewTube, a place known for its [[bullshit|forgiving nature]], such as was demonstrated at a certain [[failure|basketball game]] full of [[faggot|devoted fans]].  In the meantime, however,  LittleKuriboh is openly bisexual as he enjoys going to conventions where he can have some bum fun with his site admin, Kroze. Oh sorry, KROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE. Too bad for him, that even after being divorced, LK will forever be a perma-virgin. What did you expect from a vision impaired, balding middle aged man who makes money by redubbing a 10-year-old anime, and [[fail|doesn't understand how basic math]] works, much less the actual game?

''You've just seen every single KROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE video every posted by LittleKuriboh ever.''
<youtube>CvCWCFv70nY</youtube>

Oh and the beard is back. But who does give a shit?

==Jumping the Shark: Before and After==

''High point of LittleKuriboh's career, and THAT is saying a lot.''
<youtube>WziyFLzOS_4</youtube>

''It can safley be deduced that from this point onwards, LK officially sucks.''
<youtube>hF8-FF_V8wQ</youtube>

===After the Jump===

These videos basically summarize what LittleKuriboh has to offer recently.

''YES! MOAR Disney songs [[Jonas Brothers|turned into painfully boring ones sung in irritating voices]]! We demand''' MOAR'''!''
<youtube>HZC5jzpR8EE</youtube>

''And here you thought Leather Pants was bad.''
<youtube>K5oEyFa9XQI</youtube>

''It's funny because they're gay. Ha ha.''
<youtube>wPDQgDs7Mww</youtube>

==Yu-Gi-Oh: The Newest Movie==

<youtube>BgFD8psvLUA</youtube>

Because apparently LittleKuriboh remembered that Yu-Gi-Oh doesn't actually belong to him, he's recently promoting a 3D movie about '''CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES'''.

But it's pretty obvious that this is shameless promotion for his own take on this [[fanfiction|brand new]] Yu-Gi-Oh! movie that has been hyped up since summer 2010.

[[DO IT FAGGOT|LittleKuriboh demands that you go to see a movie about a series that everyone stopped caring about since 2004! ''IN 3D!!!!!!!!!!one!!!111111ZOMG]]''

==Naruto: [[lol wut|The Abridged Comedy Fandub Spoof Series Show]]==

Originally was an April Fool joke (hence the "spoof" word in the [[tl;dr]] title card) this once one-shot episode eventually became its own series, because apparently making fun on Yu-Gi-Oh! wasn't enough. 5 episodes in, and we already have a [[shit|movie]]. Enjoy the literal shitfest! tl;dr Let's make fun of Naruto now! Nobody has ever thought about that one before!

''Also hilarity '''hilariously''' forgets to ensue.''

{{quote|dude﻿ LK the fact u have all these dolls is a bit.. discerning...|A fan, possibly realising that all this time, he was worshipping a man who actually owns dolls.}}

==Notable quotes==
''What's ironic is that this video alone is over five years old already.''
<youtube>toP5PHbHSlU</youtube> 

''A collection of what Season II has to offer. Compared to S3, this is definitely comedy gold.''
