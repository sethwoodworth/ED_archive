JWZ

Initials and internet moniker for ex-[[AOL]] employee Jamie Zawinski. 

'''[[Jews|JWZ]]''' is, [[Internet celebrity|by Internet standards, a Rock Star]]. Well known for his work in establishing and creating what's now called [http://www.mozilla.org AOL], he used the funds from his old [[Netscape|GeoCities]] stock to establish what is a fairly well known and large venue for furries and other godless perverts, the [http://www.dnalounge.com DNA Lounge]. He still produces "software" (once a shitty LISP faggot, always a shitty LISP faggot), and has done quite a bit for [[San Francisco]]'s [[gay]] nightlife, or semblance thereof.

Of course, the "software" is the kind of ASCII animation shit that nobody wants.<br/>
This led JWZ to publicly declare an effeminate and ineffectual jihad against Palm.

He's now a proud participant of the virtual pride parade that is the iPhone app store.

Of course, with his newfound fame from his entry in the National Sex Offender Registry and loss of a fortunethe young boys he kidnapped, he now hides inside of a shelter for abused, transgendered women, hidden forever by piles of bills and receipts for bribes, booze, hormone treatment, and debauchery.

JWZ is "living" proof that cancer can get AIDS.

Many people think [[JWZ]] is a dick.  Others just think he is arrogant and egotistical.

During his final days at America Online, JWZ's screensaver included a countdown that indicated the amount of time left until his Pets.com stock options matured and he could get the hell out of the company.

Whenever people accuse [[LiveJournal]] of having no redeeming content apart from [[16 year old girls]] the defenders of LJ always point to JWZ. His LJ is simply a collection of links and pictures he finds interesting, not particularly noteworthy. Most of them are ganked from [[Boing Boing]].

JWZ is the only known person who is known to boast that he can give head to huge, hairy cock-monsters in logN. (Refuses to prove with pix.)
