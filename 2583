Eating disorder
[[Image:Eatingdisorder.gif|thumb|You have an eating disorder no matter what size you are.]]

'''Eating disorders''' are solely about getting attention. They are nothing more, and if you think otherwise you are [[lying]]. Often victims resort to cheating, stealing and [[raping]] teenagers in return for [[profit]].

Eating disorders are often a call for attention. Posting about your disorder to the internets definitely is. That makes eating disorder forums a great place for [[pedophiles]] to prey.

==Types of Eating Disorder==

===Anorexia===

{{Main|Anorexia}}

Also known as "Plan A", [[pro-ana|anorexia]] is all about discipline with goals. It is fairly easily summed up as an over-controlling of the self.

Contrary to common belief, anorexia can be caused by actual health problems like [[AIDS|contagious diseases]], [[Mexico|food poisoning]], or physical trauma. If you are not a [[16-year old girl]] or an [[attention whore]], and think you have anorexia, see a medical doctor instead of a psychiatrist.

===Bulimia===

[[Image:Chewy.gif|thumb|left|Of course eating the vomit afterward undermines the purpose of bulimia. However bulimics are [[fat|fatties]] and will eat anything anyway.]]

Also known as "Plan B", bulimia, is that lack of control. You eat, then feel guilty about it. There are ''non-purging bulimics'' (some use laxatives to vacate their bowels instead of [[vomit]]ing) and of course the common ''purging bulimics''. 

Remember kids, if you're not throwing up, you're not skinny enough.

I am still awaiting a [[voraphile]] bulimic.

===Fatties===

{{Main|Fatty}}

Overeating is the most disgusting eating disorder, visually speaking. See [[fat]] for more info.

==Atkins Diet==

A system of eating only small Atkinses, invented to turn all the world's [[fat]]ties into Atkins-zombies. The Atkins company recently went bankrupt, to the dismay of jealous, fat [[fucktards]] everywhere.

===Atkins zombie===
A less useful type of [[zombie]] that is only as common as it is because the basic resource needed to make them, [[fat]] people, is so abundant. Long-term Atkins-zombies eventually lose the use of their natural teleportation powers and are forced to rely on their offensive odor to defend themselves from predators. You can see Atkins dieters [http://www.livejournal.com/interests.bml?int=atkins+diet on LiveJournal], but don't get too close because you too are a source of lo-carbs.

====Brain Eating====

:'''Q:''' Hi!  I've been on the [[Atkins diet]] for three months, now. I've bought several books and read them all, but I'm still not sure about one point. Can I still eat brains?

:'''A:''' Yes you can! That's what makes the Atkins diet so much better than all the others. You can eat all the brains you want! [[Masturbation]] is also good and is negative calories

==Eating Disorders as a Drama-Generating Technique==
''Here are some suggestions for generating drama through eating disorders, with examples where applicable:''
* '''Announce you are have an eating disorder while you have another disorder'''. [[Gurlfriend]] was excellent at this, as she was anorexic and pregnant.
