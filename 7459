==History==
As the name might suggest, initially the community was founded by faggoty [[Final Fantasy 7]] fans, however the theme of the forum quickly moved away from Final Fantasy because Final Fantasy is [[shit]].

==Drama & Lulz==
Over the years the forum has mad massive drama fests both internally and through attacking other sites. Known for a massive rivalry with the massively faggoty webmater of "[http://www.ffonline.com FFOnline.com]" and "[http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com Tekken Zaibatsu]" over the years, and the demodding of the spam forum moderator Tut because he was a typically arrogant and stupid black person who didn't know shit.

The forums main source of drama over the years have been the spam forum known as Sector 7, and the flaming forum known as The War Room. 

Sector 7 is composed of some of the most goofy trolls on the Internet and [[4chan]] posters, as well as people whore purely devoted to the seeking of [[lulz]].

The War Room is mainly composed of Internet Badasses and [[sociopath]]s, as well as more trolls. The War Rooms only claim to fame is that it is composed of some of the most skilled members of "[http://www.flame4cash.com Flame4Cash.com]" which attained small notoriety for being the website single-handedly responsible for [[Lowtax]] removing [[FYAD]] from the viewable forums of unregistered guests at [[Something Awful]]. Most claim it's because the goons were too lazy to strike back, most ''know'' its because Lowtax got [[owned]].
