DJ-Leorina/Email log
[[DJ-Leorina|Back to originating article]]

Hilarious email logs between [[Darkstalkerlati]] (Jessica) and some idiot trying to commission her. Some interesting things to note are that '''these two girls are the same age''', take a good gander at Lati's incredibly awesome currency conversion (she sure knows what she's talking about, especially since she put it http://c.wrzuta.pl/wa4787/c593b72c000feff64ad4d914/0/michael%20buble%20-%20baby%20%28you%27ve%20got%20what%20it%20takes%29.mp3 in an amount that will need coinage to pay [Australia has dollar coins, not notes], and you can't change coins, laffffo), and overall how very little sense Lati's replies make.

Also, that last email from Lati was the last email she sent Rhap. Despite much fussing about on the commissioner's side trying to contact Lati to find out wtf, Lati will not reply to her. Awesome.

Hi DJ-Leorina (or do you prefer to be called by something else...?)

I was going to ask you about commission info, but first, I noticed that you only accept cash and cheque... I don't have a checking account, and I live in a very rural area of Australia - the nearest money-changer is several hours drive away! That and they don't change coins, of course.

Do you have any other payment options? Please get back to me!

well, my mom had a Paypal account but she won't let me have it because if I did, she'd take away my internet privilage

Um..... okay? I guess I shouldn't ask why you can't have your own PayPal account...

So once again, do you have any methods through which I could pay you for a commission? Because I really would like to buy one from you.

Hoping to hear back from you!

well you can try concealed cash (if you're careful)

as for the art, what do you want me to draw?

I can send you concealed cash, like I said, but my problem is that I don't live anywhere near a money-changer, so I can't send you American dollars.

I do however have a range of other currencies, although they are all from Commonwealth countries. I've got Australian dollars (of course), New Zealand dollars, Indian rupees and English pounds... would you accept any of those?

Yay! Thanks a lot!

Alright, I'll give a description of what I want.

(FUCKIN LONG AND BORING DESCRIPTION REMOVED)

Now, how much will this cost me (in AUS$)? I should send you 50% up front, right? And how long do you think it will take you do draw this for me?

Thanks a bunch!

wow! She's an interesting character!

let's see... You want it vectored, colored and shaded, and you want a night BG. That'll cost 9 AUD (I've just convert the currency. 8 USD = 9AUD)

Since I'll be shading it and doing the BG, it'll take a while for it to get done

Yeah, coloured and shaded is what I'd like. Guess I forget to mention it.<br/>
:)

But vectored... hm... oh, I see. I looked at your journal - I think you're confused about what vector art is, because I don't think Photoshop cannot actually draw vector art, only raster. What exactly do you mean by vector art done in Photoshop??

What exactly do you mean by vector art drawn in Photoshop, as Photoshop does not use vectors?
