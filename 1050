'''Blowback''' (closely related to the [[Streisand Effect]]) is the CIA term for the violent, unintended consequences of a [[raid|covert operation]] that are suffered by the civil population of the aggressor government.  When [[troll]]ing, blowback occurs when someone commits a public act of internet stupidity in [[b|a place they shouldn't be]].  [[Personal army]] requests often result in lulz at the expense of the /r/equester.  Leaving your [[dox|personal info]] in the [[Trey Burba|exif data of your dad's camera]] is a great way to gain fame and popularity.
