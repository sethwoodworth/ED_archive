Ask A Ninja is an [[internets]] [[podcast]] that comes from the minds of two unfunny guys, Kent Nichols and Douglas Sarine. They thought it would be cool to have a ninja sit in front of one of their low end video cameras and answer questions from the seemingly curious public. Too bad no one was really curious at all. That's what happens when you try re-popularize an [[old meme]]. You could say that Ask A Ninja is the less cost effective version of the [[homestar Runner|Strongbad E-mails]].

Recently, it's become a [[whore]] for movies like Littleman, Shawn and Marlon Wayan's most [[retard]]ed [[shit]] evar, and [[V for Vendetta]].

It is connected to a group of angry stoned college kids who put up ron paul ads on their myspace.
