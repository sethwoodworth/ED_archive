Nao
[[Image:Google nao.jpg|thumb|Nao, according to [[Google]].]]
'''"Nao"''' is an adverb, often used in grammatically incomplete sentence fragments, to describe the point in time at which the speaker wishes to obtain [[sauce]].  [[Some_argue|Some linguists claim]] that nao originated as a misspelling of the word "now"; however, this analysis is disputed, as nao often identifies a moment several minutes, hours or even days before or after the posting in which it was used.<br/>
Nao is the antonym of l8r.

== Usage ==
Nao can be used in any normal English sentence in place of either "now," or any other temporal adverb.  However, this substitutionary usage is [[lessthanthree|considerably less common]]; the word denotes a sense of urgency that would be diffused by traditional rules of sentence completeness and grammatical accuracy.  As such, nao is most commonly seen in simple imperitive sentences or sentence fragments.  In the most urgent circumstances (comprising [[at least 100|roughly 100%]] of all recorded cases), the entire sentence, fragment or phrase is capitalized.

Typically, a sentence or fragment will reference one or several posts containing images, indicating that the user wishes [[sauce]] only for those images.  Contrast with "[[Tits or GTFO]]", in which the sauce is known, but has not yet provided sufficient [[tits|imagery]].

== Ingame Nao ==
Nao is also the representative for the new [[lie|superfun, free to play, and highly innovative]] game by Nexon. I would have liked to see her in Playboy Mansion: the Game, But its too late.
