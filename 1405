If you need a good convincing example of what you don’t ever want to become, read this article. Surely, you would [[Emo|hate yourself]] if you were anything like '''ChadSyphrett'''.

Behold the epic lolcow that is {{deviantart|ChadSyphrett|Chad Andrew Syphrett}}; a man so ridiculous and [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|full of himself]] that he couldn't be anything but a [[Troll|troll]] - to the layman. Fortunately, he is all too real. He tries to butter people up everywhere he goes. Unfortunately for his ambitions, he lashes out at the first sign of resistance. Like a good lolcow, he never quits nor learns from his mistakes, preferring to piss against the wind that is the Internet, occasionally [[Internet_tough_guy|issuing death threats]] and telling people that he'll join the military just so he can learn to kill people. Let us take you on a journey around the tubes following the exploits of the man they call Chad.

==Who is Chad Syphrett?==
[[File:Chadearlylife1.png|thumb|right|A young Chad on the far left, His dad on the far right.]]
[[File:Chadearlylife2.png|thumb|right|The oldest known photo of Chad.]]
{{quote|By next week, I'll be a well-known musician, graphic-designer, comic-artist, and marketer at major websites.}}
ChadSyphrett is a 26 year [[old]] unemployed schizophrenic who has great ambitions for [[E-famous|e-fame]], a job at [[Google]], [[Srsly|opening up an internet-based amusement park]] and a [[loli]] sidekick to satisfy his sexual desires. Chad is pretty much the end result of the ungodly collision of loneliness, [[unwarranted self-importance]] and overall stupidity. Unfortunately, Chad has a sad penchant for spreading (even more) [[AIDS]] to every site he has touched. Among those websites are 4chan, Concept Art and, of course, DeviantART. 

Not much is known about Chad’s life [[IRL|in the RL]]. However it appears as though Chad is rather active in his church community, thus making him a religious nut. Moreover, he has noted that the [[FBI|feds]] have taken him away from his family, explaining his distrust for the government. Additionally, many of the statements he has made are what made him glow luminously in a dark room of other misfits. Among those statements, he claimed to hack the Gibson and, with the help of the Government, Chad redesigned (in other words, controls) all of the internet and took down the EVIL sites [[4chan]] and our beloved [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].

His understanding of the internet is also something of vast hilarity. Whenever Chad looks into a mirror, he would see himself as a '''living meme'''. That’s right; Chad has an [[Know Your Meme|awful site on memes]] despite his abuse of them. Not only that, he also believes that all Web 2.0 sites should help him pay for an [[lol|internet-themed amusement park]], something that only [[dying alone|lonely losers]] would desire.

Because Chad is a man of his word, [[lie|all his plans will come to fruition by next summer!]]

His usual plan for Success:

# Arrive at said site.
# Make grandiose plans about how you'll unite the community if they let you become a mod
# Berate and block people who say the plan will not work
# Make long winded entries about being stalked and harassed
# Call said people [[pedophile]] Nazis who worship the devil and porn, then go to 4chan
# Make tons of reports to mods in hopes they'll start blocking the people bothering you
# Make one giant thread about how to finally eliminate the troll problem; only to have trolls, regular users, and mods tell you to shut the fuck up
# Use the influence of family members in AT&T, and in the CIA to IP track and arrest the harassers and trolls in their houses.
# Get all butthurt and take faggotry to another site
# Rinse and repeat

==Chad the Conspiracy Theorist==
[[Image:Chadfromusa-gaia-profile.png|thumb|"I don't trust governments, and I will never work for them!"]]
[[Image:Chadyahooanswers.png|thumb|Chad is a little... ''misinformed''...]]
As mentioned above, [http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread346822/pg2 Chad has a major distrust for the government] after they separated him from his family. After growing it over the years, he has developed multiple conspiracy theories that make even [[Fag|other kooks]] think that he's too gullible. Unsurprisingly, Chad chose to spread his [[AIDS|monkey diseases]] to [[Above Top Secret]], a hangout for other kooks with no lives.

{{tinyquote|1=The U.S. federal government is ruled by a wicked group of people, who would love to orchestrate another massacre.

<BR><BR>

[[File:H1n1-is-manmade.jpg|thumb|It makes TOO MUCH sense!]]
The inevitable happened: Chad was banned because [[pathetic|not even they wanted him there]]. As a logical response to this great crime, he accused the mods of being CIA plants, because Chad is a [[fail|genius]] on top of being [[sarcasm|cool]]. It was also revealed that Chad was removed from his home by the CPS. Not only that, but his dad had to resort to legally changing their name from 'Sypher' to 'Syphrett'. The reason for such an action is currently unknown, but it naturally signifies that the Syphrett family is not on good terms with the [[Government|Guv’ment]].

==Chad Syphrett meets DeviantArt==
[[Image:DeviantArt Logo Blue BG by ChadSyphrett.png|thumb|The infamous image]]
[[File:Atheist_fail_OC.jpg|thumb|And the completely legit OC.]]
[[File:Chadsyphrett-message.PNG|thumb|100px]]
In comes the major shitstorm: Chad joins the awful site known as [[deviantART]] on July 12th [[2009]]. Chad had two clear routes for e-fame in mind: first, Chad desires to be the ambassador of DeviantART and every important Web 2.0 site. The second route was to maintain and establish a [[mantrain|community project]]. He tried and failed; the story of his life. Despite failing, Chad still parades his status as an employee or, in other cases, his future employee status.

Afterwards, he created eleven official-looking-pseudo-clubs centering on various "projects". All of them had one goal, and that goal was to get Chad famous, proving that DevaintART is indeed the prime example of his self-centered ideals. In order to get this epic win, he badgered other people for content and spammed others to advertise said clubs to gather support. Although he then abandoned these clubs because he is, after all, a [[lazy]] fuck. But even then he didn't lose his ambition for e-fame.

[[ChadSyphrett/DAProjects|Here is a separate page for all his "project" accounts, their history, and many failures.]] No fucking joke.

Everything Chad comes up with is [http://forum.deviantart.com/devart/suggestions/1346316/ completely original], including [http://chadsyphrett.deviantart.com/art/DeviantArt-Logo-Blue-BG-146215007 the revolutionary deviantART logo] that he made all by himself! He uses the same fucking picture, eats it, digests it, and then re-releases it through his bloody diarrhea as a brand new '[[abortion|deviation]]'. As he is more of a tracer than an artist, he rapes google images on a hourly basis. And although his amazing claim of 100% OC seemed impossible to disprove, someone found a logo that [http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/10/23/new-atheist-symbol/ looks too similar] [[o rly|to "his" idea]]. In an act of reasonable innocence, he promptly [[baleeted|hid]] the comment.

[http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/10/23/new-atheist-symbol/ Original atheist symbol]. Among his famous creations are Captain Bizarre, a look deviously stolen by [[Michael Jackson]]'s chimp Bubbles plus a Jew hat, and [[Batman|Fapman]]; which were clearly pirated by DC Comics.

On top of everything else, Chad has a poor understanding of rules. The following is a list of known examples of Chad's misunderstandings, we shit you not.

*[http://forum.deviantart.com/devart/suggestions/1387969/ Mod-Privileges For Victims Of Constant Harassment]
**Spawned after he made a gay-bashing journal and received criticism.

**With no excuses.

*[http://comments.deviantart.com/5/28747451/1287831381 They're following the rules...Chad...wtf?]

Reasoning with Chad is like talking to a brick wall, because he [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/137412254/1226189454 will] [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/137412254/1226215000 think] [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/137412254/1226207871 you're spamming him.] Even when you [[Leet|speak coherently.]]

After countless acts of [[asshat]]tery and spam, he was finally banned from DA. #Daramatica, the group he despises the most, collectively lol'd, thus forcing Chad to have his e-[[period]] and act like a bitch. From then on, he was set to [[internet tough guy]] mode and threatened anyone who stood in his way. He even declared that the staff could not, and should not, ban him for he is a living meme from a website. It should be noted that calling Chad a meme even disgusts [[Milhouse]].

===Chad the Perv===
[[image:Chaddy8b.jpg|thumb|He wants you.]]
[[image:Wtf-chad.jpg|thumb|Chad conversing with a [[Slut|dumb girl]].]]
[[image:2i20hau.jpg|thumb|Nothing wrong here!]]
Chad portrays himself to be an [[Loser|anti-social]] entity through his separation from his family, his addiction to everything on the internet, and that which he has posted on various websites. Needless to say, Chad is a [[virgin]] hungering for a nice tight snatch. Unfortunately, women would rather touch an electric fence than his greasy [[black]] skin. As a result, Chad looks for [[jailbait|girlfriends]] on the internet since it is, notably, the best place in existence to [[fleshlight|find one]]. Like in everything from his life, Chad fails at getting a girlfriend. At first he'd said he was twenty-six, his true age, just to gloat about his empty achievements and superiority. Then, after being confronted by a [[loli|younger girl]], he suddenly [[pedophile|changed his age to fourteen]]. 

Girls from deviantART are among his favorite to stalk, especially those with whom he has debated with to determine their intelligence. As he is in fact very lonely and desperate, even if he'd never seen a picture of a girl, he will still ask said loli if she wants to be his girlfriend. Successful results have been pending for the last 100 years. This is odd, considering this [[pretty cool guy|smooth talker]] used his most famous gems like asking to touch her 'cooch' and wanting to “[[Yiff|[have] puppies]]” with her.  Moreover, he would put this creepy bullshit to underage girls; remember, this man is [[pedophile|twenty-six years old]]. Perhaps the reason for his affinity for loli is that they are just too stupid to see through his crazy bullshit. Nonetheless, [[bawww|none of them]] ever engaged in a [[Cockblock|serious cyber-relationship with him]].

{{quote|I want to touch your… you know. [...] You’re really the only friend I want to f***.|[[:File:Chadsyphrett-pedo.PNG|Chad talking to Autumn-singer]].}}

Often denied access to [[delicious flat chest]], Chad will cling to a certain girl by favoring their works and constantly commenting. When he receives feedback from his victim, he will not only blurt his interest in [[rape|romantic partnership]], but also [[LOL WUT|telling her that he is sexually obsessed with her]]. When given the same answer of “no”, he would ask why, claiming that he has done nothing wrong. Upon the girl blocking him from her page and/or hiding his comments, Chad will panic and respond to this action by creating (or just using another pre-made) sockpuppet to confront this girl as she clearly made a mistake in refusing his [[lie|glorious]] pen0r. Also, don't call Chad a stalker because Chad will go completely apeshit if any girl calls him a stalker. Oh the [[irony]].

But if that's not enough for you, check out these journals:

==The Enemies==
[[File:Chadsyphrettsupportssickfucks.png|center]]
[[Image:Chadthreatenstokilldisagreers.png|100px|thumb|Chad is in the army! The army of ONE.]]

Chad will call anybody who disagrees with him a harasser. As you can see, [[Bullshit|Chad is very reasonable]] in claiming this, because only retards and trolls would disagree with his opinion of truth. Let’s take a look at how Chad rightfully judges others:

*If you disagree with Chad Syphrett, you are a stalker and/or harasser.  Chad meets a lot of [[irony|stalkers]] & harassers on DA.
*If you don't send your content for DeviantART Magazine fast enough, [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/10721399/1221484469 you're on his shit list].
*If you don't reply to his messages fast enough, you're going to get [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Songswriters-comments1.png trolled] by one of [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Chadsyphrett-losing-his-shit.png his alternate accounts].

In regards to the image above, this would mean that Chad supports [[attention whores]], [[pedophile]]s, cannibals and harassers, as long as they do not congregate at 4chan or ED; murderers, rapists, thieves, art defacers, scammers, animal abusers, animal rapists, hypocrites, art theives, slanderers, IRL harrassers, plagiarists, porn addicts, [[terrorist]]s, [[lolwut|facetiously polite people]], fetishists, pushy fetishists, cybersex roleplayers, internet sluts, skiddies, drama whores, and [[you]]. A fine list he has made, indeed! After all, furries do not appear once, proving there's [[lie|some hope for him after all]].

After a while of being cruelly harassed and stalked by perverted bigots, he got a [[Stalking|love poem]] made by a visitor that launched a thousand ships. He cried about it and the rest of the haters in his infamous journal, the one with the tl;dr hit list. Blocking trolls is one thing, but he did something more retarded, and that's rubbing his recent blockage to the blockees' faces, [[Irony|effectively spamming and harassing the blockee instead]]. But hey, +1 pageview!

Once Chad realized that ED was in hot pursuit, he registered under the name "DeviantArt" to incite drama and throw ED off his trail.  When that failed, he registered under his own name to [[USI|gloat]]. In fact, why not read the [[ChadSyphrett/ChadOnEDF|quick rundown of the 1500 reply thread?]] Other than causing a few basement dwellers to break a sweat from typing, it accomplished nothing productive.

==More examples of his failures==
===4chan===
[[Image:Chad4chan.JPG|thumb|150px|SIEG HEIL [[Pedobear|FUHRERBEAR]]. Oh ,the cruel and sweet irony.]]
One day, Chad submitted a deviation with his opinion on 4chan. They were less than flattering of these upstanding anons and failed to consider the fact that memes and 4chan go together like [[Africa]] and AIDs. IRL, many channers are be [[Crybaby|immature]], [[fat]] and [[newfag|abuse memes]], but Chad is someone who respects these great creations and wants to [[No|make an internet-themed amusement park]] in their honour. On top of that, as he considers himself to be a living meme. As such, it's natural to assume Chad would be a 4channer himself, but fuck you, because he's too good for those ungrateful shits.
{{tinyquote|My ART is for you to share with others.

[[Irony|I HATE THOSE PEDOS!]]|[http://www.flickr.com/photos/webcomic/3745573044/ Chad on Flickr]}}

The attention whore that he is lets us assume he was a namefag (probably going by the [[retarded|clever]] name 'AnonymousJoker'). The origins of his second super creative name 'SmartTroll' isn't fully understood, but it's a safe bet that he came up with it when 4chan accused him of trolling with his shitty comics' spam.

Why would a morally righteous person, such as Chad, ever even want to be a part of 4chan? This art [http://chadsyphrett.deviantart.com/art/Anonymous-Joker-Huge-Eyes-Yay-132858282 deviation] of his might have the answer.

===The True Computer Expert===
[[Image:ChadSyphrett-masterspy.jpg|thumb|left|Oh that Chad! What a guy!]]
[[Obvious|As all computer experts know]], Windows was made with multiple CIA back doors to find his CP. But because Chad Syphrett is a very important person with OMG government connections, he needed a more secure operating system. The clear choice was Windows XP x64. Unfortunately, he couldn't figure out what hardware he had, [[google|what drivers are]] or [[retarded|how to install the OS on his system]]. When Dell Support wouldn't help him install this obviously superior OS, he turned to the most logical alternative: [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1152449 Unbutu support forums].  He got no help there or at [http://www.donationcoder.com/Forums/bb/index.php?topic=18231.0 Donation Coder], so he stumbled into DriverPacks.net forums and [http://forum.driverpacks.net/viewtopic.php?id=3740 demanded help without reading the FAQ or stickies]. This resulted in his first known [[lulz|epic smackdown]].

Chad Syphrett apologized to most of the people, who received that message. They no longer threaten him, and Chad no longer [[sick fuck|wears a strap-on dildo when he chases children on bikes.]]|Chad Syphrett [http://bit.ly/bhDefl]|
:D There's no one online, who knows the true Chad Syphrett. There's absolutely no proof to back up slanderous claims against Chad Syphrett & other online-personalities. Chad's accounts are used by many people, so there's no way for his stalkers to know which of his past messages were made by him or 1 of his friends.

You don't know Chad Syphrett, unless you actually know him. So shut the fuck up, don't read the slanderous articles about him. See him for yourself on youtube, this summer! You might even catch him on the Deviant Art Channel by then.|[http://comments.deviantart.com/5/29195697/1312129447 RageHere (ChadSyphrett)]
|7. Chad Syphrett doesn't really know how old he is.

"I'm as old as I want to be!  The Gregorian-calendar is false/erroneous.  I don't care to keep or observe, unless I have business to do.  I don't even celebrate holidays & 'birth-dates' according to that calendar!"|ChadSyphrett, "I want REAL Friends" journal
|III. Who are the worst people on the internet?
<BR><BR>
1. Online-harassers (aggressive stalkers) & every other type of delusional-person, who think they really know you just by reading your comments (whether they were made in jest or not).|[http://chad-syphrett.deviantart.com/journal/29173373/ Chad-Syphrett]
|Example of a serious hypocrite: A person, who judges Chad Syphrett just because things he wrote online. That person (people in general) do not know what Chad Syphrett really looks like or what he does, in real-life (beside write to strangers online).
<BR><BR>
4. Willfully-ignorant people, who think they know others well enough to judge them based on what they've read about them (whether they've read comments that were satire or not).|[http://chad-syphrett.deviantart.com/journal/29173373/ Chad-Syphrett]
|Fail again! Chad doesn't even use this account.
<BR><BR>
You have no clue how sad & lame you are, do you?
<BR><BR>
Probably not, eh. WELL Too Bad. Awww.
<BR><BR>
-Many friends of Chad|[http://comments.deviantart.com/4/11547139/1305049683 MakeThisIntoAMovie]
|Truth and Love will set you free.|Conspiracyfag and [[lolicon]] rolled up together is Chad
|I may mock & treat them like animals, simply because they're born to be used & pushed aside from the wise & gifted kinds.|Chad, on his [[USI|messiah complex]]
|I don't serve people of the world. I don't love them. The world doesn't love me. However, the world uses what I provide: [[Shit|artwork]] & [[tl;dr|words of wisdom]]. As long as I serve the creator, I will fight for the righteous & meek on this earth.
<BR><BR>
I'm happy to be the world's enemy. I will never serve it or fall down & support anything made by people of the world!|Chad is our savior who wants to die for our sins.}}|color= skyblue}}</center>
