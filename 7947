Switch police on
{{Forced Meme}}



[[Image:switch.jpg|thumb|right|Switch police on]]
Switch police on is a shitty [[Milhouse|forced]] [[4chan]] meme full of fail and aids which was invented [[last thursday]].

Switch the police on started when some [[fuckface]] posted a link to an article in [[German]], forgetting that 4chan is full of [[American]] dipshits who can only attempt [[English]].  As the article was about a guy [[rape|raping]] his 12-year-old sister and therefore [[relevant]] to most of 4chan's [[hookers and blow|interests]], the American [[/b/]]-tards took to the internets in an attempt to translate it.  They came up with:



{{quote|''"Swan village - the [[police]] already arrested the [[16 year old girl|16 years old pupil]] on past Friday. The young person put, communicated a comprehensive confession down police headquarters in the oberpfaelzischen Amberg. "the Martyrium of the girl took a whole year" since beginning of the year up to the past week, thus already nearly, said a police speaker.

''To the light the crime came, after the [[Xbox 360|achievements]] of the girl in the school had become worse in the past weeks ever. "fortunately the [[faggot|class chief]] reacted exemplarily and tried, to the causes to the reason to go", said the police speaker. The twelve-year-old boys finally it entrusted itself to its teacher and reported that she is forced for months from [[incest|her brother to sexual actions]]. '''The school switched immediately the police on.'''"''|[[Retarded|Rough Translation]]}}

==What It Means, [[You]] [[Retard]].==

{{quote|''Schwandorf - The [[police]] confirmed the arrest of a [[16 year old girl]] last Friday. The adolescent has a given a comprehensive confesstion, away from the police department of the district of [[Germany|Amberg]]. "She's felt [[emo|suicidal]] since the beginning of the year, up until [[last Thursday|a week ago]]. That's almost an entire year already." said a police officer.

The crime came to light after she began to get worse at [[Columbine|school]] in the past weeks. "It was fortunate that the Class [[bitch|Chief]] reacted so well and attempted to find the cause." said the police officer. The [[13 year old boy|12 year old boy]] eventually went to his teacher and confessed to her that as of a few months ago, his sister (the [[16 year old girl]] had forced him to perform sexual acts on her. The school immediately called the [[CIA|police]]. ''|[[Nazi|Spiegel Online with the help of a /b/tard WHO ACTUALLY SPEAKS NAZI]]}}

Starved for even remotely [[original content]], /b/ jumped on this phrase like hyenas to a carcass, and within minutes it was being [[shoop|shopped]] onto various images. There is debate as to whether this constitutes a forced meme or an insta-meme.
