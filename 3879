IQ Test

[[Image:SmartBunny.jpg|thumb|left|Your 'joke' score.]]In May 2006, an '''IQ test''' [[meme]] from IQ Challenge travelled far and wide on [[Livejournal]] within one day. Countless happy LJers proudly displayed their high scores on their journals, and waited for the accolades to flood in.

Unfortunately for them, it was a hoax.  No matter how you actually did on the test, it gave you a high score and a bunny graphic to put on your blog/LJ/whatever.  You would see the image saying you scored highly (around 150).  However, other people who went to your blog would see your score as being somewhere between 70-80; displayed next to a dim-witted bunny. 

Most bloggers got embarrassed by proudly posting their scores and later deleted the entry.  Many people got really cocky about it saying things like, "I'm smart!  I'm superior!  I always knew I was brilliant!" or "I can't believe how much higher I scored than so-and-so."  The dramatic irony was that they looked overly pleased with an IQ score of...70?! And so became a source of much lulz.

This lulzsome meme was created by notorious poop-fetishist [[Triggur]] in an inspired moment of pure [[troll]].
