'''????''' is a [[Magick|magical]] process by which anything can be turned into [[PROFIT]]! Originally this was part of the secret business plan to making a shit load of money in a [[Capitalist]] society by the "Underpants Gnomes" from the [http://www.southparkstudios.com/episodes/103595 '''Gnomes - The Search For Underpants'''] episode of ''[[South Park]]''. Their formula for turning underpants into Jew is demonstrated thusly:

# Collect underpants.
# ?
# [[Profit]]

Note that only one ? was used and that PROFIT! was never written in [[ALL CAPS]] or with an exclamation point, but [[B|/b/]] added [[moar]] ?s because they suffer from a collective [[mental insufficiency]].

==Example==

Behold ???? in action:

==The Song==
<pre>Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey!
We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day!</pre>

==Solving ????==
[[Nerds|Anon scientists]] have been attempting to solve ???? and discover the details of the process for many years. So far all attempts have [[fail]]ed, although ???? is believed to involve infecting [[Snakes on a Plane|Samuel L. Jackson]] with [[AIDS]].  However, there is one critical flaw in  this theory: Mace Windu is a nigger and already has AIDS; therefore, [[Derp|researchers]] are now trying to discover a way to inject live scorpions into his dick.  They're not sure it will do anything useful, [[For the lulz|but believe it is worth a try]], [[Trollface|just in case]].
