ImageBoard4Free
[[Image:Ib4f2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|So innovative that some say it is the [[AOL]] of chan software.]]
The year was [[2009]], there was a distinct lack of [[shitty]], generic, poorly thought-out furry [[chans]] in the chan world. Something needed to be done. Step forward “Infinitus“, a supple newfag from South Bend, Indiana. He harbored a dream, a dream where moronic technically-retarded individuals could create a chan on their own on a simple whim, without needing to give any thought to [[OC|originality]], content or ways of gaining users other than the method of [[spam|spamming]].

It was on this dream that ImageBoard4Free was born, a rip off of the [[kusaba]] software that allowed any wannabe admin to click a few buttons and 10 seconds later own their own [[imageboard]], possibly named after some cheaply purchased domain. If you multiply this new easy creation of  [[cancer|chan]] by [[over 9000|hundreds]], as happened, a beautiful new imageboard network with a beautiful new quantity>quality [[philosophy]] is born.



==Instructions on making your chan successful==
Step 1: Create board.

Step 2: Make many sub-boards as you can for different types of porn.

Step 3: Dump as much porn as you can to it.

Step 4: ????

Step 5: Just like every other board on IB4F congratulations!

==Chans Created On ImageBoard4Free==
[[Image:Ib4f3.png|thumb|right|250px|Whether Poland or ImageBoard4Free, [[Nazi|German]] presence is imminent.]]
Despite IB4F giving any [[retard]] the chance to waltz up and make their own chan, there are exceptions to every trend, and IB4F seems to be the very exception tof the trend of exceptions in trends. Chans created include:


'''[http://imageboard4free.com/board/ ThisPose]''' - A chan for pictures of girls in a particular position. "Bent over" oder "spread legs" for example.

'''[http://u18chan.imageboard4free.com/ U-18Chan]''' - "The largest furry chan on IB4F, also the largest chan. 100% furry porn. Renamed from the previous board name FilthySlothChan to prevent the utter flood of trolling and [[b&]]s they were forced to dish out to protect their furporn. [[aurorafurries|See AuroraFurries]]

'''[http://trollingchan.imageboard4free.com/ TrollChan]''' - "The only board with a good idea on IB4F. A board based around trolling. Expressing the failure of IB4F, this board has no board for trolling. Oh well, there's always /b/. Their <s>admin</s> FEARLESS LEADER Obscurity is a fucking weeaboo. Fail. <s>They also hold a secret raid board at <s>[http://trollingchan.imageboard4free.com/zomg /zomg/.]</s> Never mind, it got taken down. Obscurity got beaten to the first post on /b/, which was later deleted in butthurt rage. This, mind you all happened within the first ten minutes of the chan being up. On the /g/ - General board, Obscurity has traced the IP of an Anon that called him a faggot and posted his dox. Don't mess with the admin there. They'll fuck your shit up.</s> HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT THEY GOT HAXED. NEWFAGS. Being pwned by the same guy that called Obscurity a faggot, a classic case of vengeance from a proxy.

'''[http://imageboard4free.com/board/NIPA  Nipachan]''' - A site focused on the animes [[Higurashi|Higurashi no naku koro ni]] and [[shit that nobody cares about|Umineko no naku koro ni]] it allows you to post [[gore]] in every board. Hmm.

==DDoS Drama==

[[Image:Ib4f5.png|thumb|right|300px|[[RockstarChan]] mods warmly react to Bunkerchan [[spam]].]]Because of how [[stupid|smart]] some of the IB4F [[chan]] [[admins]] are, and because of the ingenius way every single board is hosted on a single server, IB4F is forever squatting down, arms and knees pinned to the floor, preparing to take another round of [[DDoS]] [[rape|rapeage]]. Of course, this is only this danger if some fresh-faced admin is actually [[dumb]] enough to do something as retarded as spamming advertisements for their IB4F chan around every other chan, proclaiming it to be the single greatest thing that ever existed. How likely is that?

On Tuesday 7th July 2009, someone started spamming advertisements for “bunkerchan“ around every other chan, proclaiming it to be the single greatest thing that ever existed. Bunkerchan was a [[*chan]] formed during the downtime of [[4chan]], while they were DDoS’d by [http://insurgen.info/wiki/Fel0ny some unknown source], and bunkerchan claimed to be the sole refuge for homeless 4channers. It turns out Bunkerchan admins [[stupid|thought it would be a smart idea]] to get their message across to these homeless 4channers by [[spamming]] their url across the various *chans 4channers were now scattered across. It tends to be the case however that other [[imageboard]] admins do not take too kindly to having their site spammed, nor do they tend to take too kindly when that spam happens to be advertisements for a rival imageboard, and it was no surprise that a retaliatory DDoS was hastily issued against Bunkerchan. Every one of IB4F’s then 200+ sites was taken offline for nearly two days.

IB4F was drawn into a panic, as admins started turning on each other, on the host admin himself, thinking the site had been v&, or worse, raped by [[azn|Alberto Fujimori]]. Through the smoke of fried server and [[13-year-old boy]]‘s alarmed flatulence the cause of the DDoS emerged, and though bunkerchan was later removed from hosting on IB4F, DDoS remains a terrifying [[monster]] that is always lurking just around the corner for ImageBoard4Free.

==The Takedown==
[[Image:ImageBoard4Free Down.jpg]][[Image:Imageboard4free Update.PNG]]

As of the 8th of February, 2010, a new update appeared from the admin stating [[Lies|the site will be back up soon]].
He hasn't answered any of his staff or even bothered to talk to them since he took the site offline. Many chans continue to function... with no posts however, the two largest chans are porn oriented [http://u18chan.imageboard4free.com/ U-18Chan] the furry chan. With [http://imageboard4free.com/board/bara0/ BaraChan] coming up in second place. This has caused IB4F's most well-known administrator next to Infinitus to rage. RAGE. and RAGEEEEEEEEEEEEE until he ragequit over the fact. He doesn't have to moderate anymore, because every post is a furfag dump or a photoshopped [[dong]].

{{quote|I wouldn't have anything to administrate if we enacted a "No furfag/gay porn rule".| ~Vorche}}

{{quote|All the furfag/gay posts caused me to rage quit for awhile| ~Vorche}}

==The Restart==
As of the 13'th of april IB4f came back up. After almost 130 days of downtime.
