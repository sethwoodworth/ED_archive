'''Don’t ask, don’t tell''' was an Americunt military policy that barred dirty faggots from joining the only military endorsed by ''God Himself''™.

After crunching the numbers, [[oxymoron|military intellectuals]] were infuriated that they were not given the opportunity to send thousands of faggots to their deaths and demanded repeal. The faggot run government however, insisted on sending the freedom hating homos to the safety payed for with the blood of hard working heterosexuals.

This blatant act of reverse [[darwin]]ism was crushed by the mighty fist of God in [[2010]]. No longer will God-fearing, apple pie loving heterosexuals [[die alone]] while hatefull homos are out reaping the rewards.

A bunch of queers got killed in [[Iraq]] and nothing of value was lost.
