'''Silsor''' is a young [[Wikipedia]] [[wikipedophile|administrator]] out looking for the love of his life. He is a student at University of Toronto at Mississauga in Canada.

Silsor has a real sweet tooth and enjoys snowmen, [[Slurpee|Slurpees]], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Something_Awful_Forums&action=history protracted edit wars].

Silsor's favorite article to babysit is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Something_Awful_Forums Something Awful Forums], which he watches like a hawk to make sure that nothing critical of [[Lowtax]] is ever added to the entry.  With the help of this kind king of '''NPOV''', the article now reads like an advertising circular.  Silsor was particularly upset when someone edited the meticulous list of unimportant forums and subforums to add the heavily trafficed but ostensibly secret file forums which were responsible for many of SA's new registrations until January 2005.  According to Silsor, removing valid information in an otherwise excessively 'informative' article is NPOV as long as it protects the reputation of a commercial webmaster.

Silsor is a [[failure]] and a fundamentalist [[Christian]] when he feels like it.

Silsor's name is a contraction of "Silicon Sorceror". One of his hobbies is poetry, as evidenced at [http://home.erin.utoronto.ca/~jbonham/least_favourite_things.txt]. Silsor can generally be found lurking on IRC in "elite" channels.
