Simple English
[[Image:mousedick.jpg|thumb|Talking to people in '''Simple English''' can be made easier with pictures.]]'''Simple English''' is English for [[Retards|simple people]]. 

Some people, like [[jailbait|the young]], [[Aspies|people with learning differences]], [[Azns|people whose mother language is not English]], [[furries]] (animal-people lovers), and [[niggers|people of different ethnicities]], may have difficulty understanding words that native English-speakers understand, including [[meme]]s (things people find funny to repeat over and over). Simple English is a way to talk to people without making them feel bad right away.

Used right, '''Simple English''' is a great way to convey complex concepts to [[n00bs|new members]], as well as a good means of [[condescension]] (telling someone how stupid they are in an indirect way).
