[[Image:Hopkin-large.jpg|right|thumb|The note.]]

In an [[old meme]], a young boy by the name of Terry looking for frog. [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|Him name was '''Hopkin Green Frog''']]. Terry love Hopkin Green Frog and love all of us. Terry put up flyers all over [[internets|the neighborhood]] asking who took and who might have found Hopkin Green Frog.

He also gave us a glimpse of his enduring hope telling us that: {{quote|I'll find my frog, who took my frog.|Terry}}

After much research by various [[Internet Detectives]], it was discovered that Terry was looking for a stuffed frog toy, and also, had [[autism]].  While [[awesome|sad]], this did not decrease the [[lulz]].
