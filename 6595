==The Meme==
Preved is a [[Russia|Russian]] [[meme]] which was created [[last thursday]] when some Russian decided to photoshop a shitty picture by [[americunt]] painter [[Shit nobody cares about|John Lurie]]. Its basically a picture of a bear in the woods shouting 'suprise' at a couple [[sex|getin it on]]. Its propper use is when the bear is shooped into a picture with a [[man]] and his [[woman|bitch]].

==Old Media==
The preved bear was actually used to launch a suprise question on [[Bad Vlad|Putin]], as to how he rated his puppet president. However thanks to a last minute [[barrel roll]] he was able to deflect this. Despite the [[fact]] that the question never got answered and the thread which started the whole thing was sick with fail, the Russian [[old media]] when wild, angry that the interwebz would dare question their mighty tzar, so for a few weeks a fuckload of articles upon the cancerous spread of the meme were written.
