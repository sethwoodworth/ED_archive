'''BIKECAT''' is [[cruise control]] for [[cat|cats]].  Originally posted on a [[2chan]] pets forum, BIKECAT (aka "[[Pedobear|Kuma]]") eventually found his way to [[4chan]] and other English speaking image boards due to his overwhelming popularity and [[awesome]]. Instead of [[shooping]] [[cocks]] and [[Shitting Dick Nipples|dick nipples]] onto him (unlike everything else that winds up on [[/b/]]) BIKECAT was an immediate hit, and tards started to request more photos of the white and grey cat wearing a red collar, riding around town in a bookbasket. Debate went back and forth as to whether to name him BIKECAT or BASKETCAT, however BIKECAT won out in the end because BASKETCAT is [[you|gay]]. BIKECAT has been featured in [[Caturday]] images, popular [[macros]] and other memes, and unless you live in one of those crappy countries that doesn't have [[internets]] yet, he is most likely relevant to your interests.

==BIKECAT Begins==

Not much is known about the origins of BIKECAT or how his owner found him. A picture collage of a sickly, collar-less kitten leads some to believe that he was originally rescued from a gloomy [[ghetto]] in [[Japan]]. As the photos progress, the healing powers of the red collar are evident, as it slowly cures BIKECAT of his [[Diabeetus]] and [[AIDS]]. [[Noone]] knows who would be stupid enough to abandon such an awesome cat, but experts speculate that he or she is a [[douchebag]].

BIKECAT is known to have a grumpy look on his face in many of his photos. It is impossible to know why he always looks pissed off, but it might have something to do with that asshole [[lense flare|snapping pictures]] at him non-stop.

==[[Redundant|Wikipedia Faggotry]]==

Currently, [[TOW]] [[fail|fails]] to recognize BIKECAT as a relevant subject for their shitty wiki, and his article has already been deleted several times. Apparently, the assbags at Wikipedia think that [[Shit nobody cares about|things like ''Golden Girls'' trivia, or the history of Bulgarian transvestites]], are much more important topics than the greatest cat to ever live. However since TOW fails to document anything else in the internet without failing in the most horrible and anti-lulzy was as possible: it's probably better that they do not desecrate something as epic as BIKECAT.

==BIKECAT Today==
Kuma's owner has not posted any BIKECAT pictures on 2chan for a few months, leading some to speculate about the well being of our beloved furball. [[Some argue]] that BIKECAT may have met the same fate as [[Rob Levin|other]] [[Ripper|popular]] [[Kevin Neil Whitrick|internet]] [[Mitch Henderson|icons]]. But these ideas are ridiculous, as everyone knows that God-cats are immortal. 

==Fun Facts==
*BIKECAT's full IRL name is "[[Pedobear|Kuma]][[Guro|goro]]", the Japanese translation of "Yogi Bear".
*Is the [[Jesus|Savior]] and next Emperor of Japan.
*Fanbois refer to Kuma as "the King of Cats", "Superior Cat", or "Emperor of Cats", and many [[weeaboo|long to visit Japan]] just to pet him.
*The red collar that BIKECAT wears says "[[lessthanthree|<3]] Dog" on it. It is unknown at this time whether or not BIKECAT actually likes dogs or not, however, it is more likely that his owner simply failed [[Engrish]] class.
