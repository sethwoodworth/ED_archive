Teamspeak
'''Teamspeak''' is a small step forward in the ways of communication on the Internet, allowing [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] [[nerd]]s to communicate [[in the ass|voice to voice]].  It's yet another useless advent, but one that may just encourage them to get outside and breed.

Which could be very BAD for humanity. [[Image:notforyooo.jpg|right|thumb|It's extremely bad for humanity actually. (Wikipedia submission.)]]

This: "oh stfu you worthless cockjuggling leukemia-patient" is an example of common teamspeak Dialouge as their servers are full of [[internet tough guy]]s and 12 year old children.

For a list of games that utilize teamspeak, [[plz]] see [[:Category:Gaming|our list of XBOX games]].
