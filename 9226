Y2K was an [[old meme]] that was popular towards the end of the [[1990s]]. The original Y2K meme was a [[creepypasta]] about how at the beginning of the [[internet|new]] millennium, all computers would break and the [[internets]] would die because of [[Bill Gates]]. 

In order to prevent this catastrophe, [[W]] made a deal with the Jew that if they didn't do Y2K, [[Jews did WTC|they could do WTC]] instead.

Horrifyingly enough, none of the computers manufactured before 2000 now operate, confirming the above statements.

==The Scare==

[[Some argue|Some people]] were stupid enough to buy "[[plastic crap|Y2K kits]]", stock up on food and groceries at the last minute, and generally stay in a state of panic for the entire week leading up to New Years. 

The ball dropped, clocks changed over, the Internet didn't [[divide by zero|crash]], life went on as normal, and nothing of [[porn|value]] was lost

A few funny things happened however, like a [[Japanese]] power plant's radiation detectors [[fail|shutting down]].[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/585013.stm 1]

In hindsight, it would of been the most awesome way to troll the entire world if someone found a way to make a virus big and bad enough to take down every computer in the world. Maybe <strike>next millennium</strike> [[Fact|in <strike>2039</strike> 2038]] - enjoy your 31 bit computer clocks.

==The Awful Truth== 

A little known but increasingly obvious fact is that the catastrophic Y2K meltdown did actually occur and is an ongoing occurrence. Since a billionth of a second just before/after [[masturbation|the stroke of midnight]] on December 31st 1999 [[the internets|the universe]] has been locked in a [[You|logical fallacy]], caused by the bug, from which it is impossible to escape. The fallacy being that nothing happened. Once this is accepted and internalised it is easy to spot the signs of this catastrophe everywhere. The main clue is that there is no evidence; if there were evidence we would not be locked in the false loop at all. This is fact. 
	
According to numerous studies the best way to deal with this catastrophe is to carry on as normal and forget you ever knew the awful truth. For those who can handle such paradoxes, a slightly [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|more meaningful]] way to deal with this is to carry on as normal whilst keeping the thought in the back of your mind that none of this is real and [[Lulz|most people donâ€™t know it]].
