Sadly, No!
Simply put, [http://www.sadlyno.com Sadly, No!] is a political groupblog written by liberal alcoholics who aren't cool enough for a seat at the adult Democrats table. While other political blogs strive to [[Arguing on  the internet|debate their opponents on the left or the right]], Sadly, No! strives to mock them, or attend their gatherings hopped up on goofballs and cheap plastic bottle booze.

Populated by basement-dwelling lunatics, the comments are an ongoing circle-jerk not unlike what you'd find on [[Gawker Media|Gawker]] - increasingly sad attempts at biting and incisive humor made in vain hope of being invited into the upper Valhalla of ''main page posters''. On occasion, however, someone will manage to discover something truly amazing and bring the political blogosphere's attention to the existence of '''[[Cigarskunk|conservative cigar-fetishizing furries]]'''.
