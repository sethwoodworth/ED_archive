Grunge
[[Image:BLARG_IM_DED.jpgâ€Ž|thumb|GRUNGE IS DEAD]]

Created in the '80s by [[fucktard|fucktards]] with flannel t-shirts that didn't like to take baths, grunge was sucked mainly out of the [[heroin]] ridden music scene of [[Seattle]]. the music was a combination of [[Punk]], [[Metal]], and [[Sonic Youth|Alternative]] music, most of which was sappy and corny at the time. The typical band was signed mainly from the chances that one member would become [[an hero]] by injecting himself with large quantities of [[drugs]] or [[shotgun mouthwash]], so that the [[Jews|music moguls]] could bank a few extra albums after the subsequent [[Faux News|neverending media coverage]]. This eventually became [[truth]], since Kurt Cobain's suicide brought [[Jew gold|a spike in album sales]] shortly after his rotting corpse was found and long after people stopped giving a shit about his music. 

The fad eventually was replaced by late 90's [[college]] rock derivatives such as [[Jesus|Creed]], [[fat|Blues Traveler]], [[gay|Green Day]], [[fail|Dave Matthews Band]], and [[shit|Nickelback]] and eventually grandfathered [[emo]], another shitty punk movement playing on [[13 year old boys|teen angst]] from a new generation.

===Nirvana===
[[heroin|Nirvana]] - Comprised of [[An Hero|Kurt Cobain]], [[THE BEST|Dave Grohl]], and a few other interchangeable failures nobody cares about. Nirvana [[buttsecks|spearheaded]] the grunge movement by releasing one half-ass album, Bleach, followed by that album with a [[baby fuck|baby penis]] on the cover. They were well-known for screaming the plagiarized [[lies|"generation defining"]] song [[CP|Smells Like Teen Spirit]] ([[truth|which was actually named after a deodorant brand which Kurt Cobain mistook for a revolutionary statement, of course he didn't know what deodorant was]]), smashing their guitars over stadium equipment at the end of concerts, making mtv shit bricks and [[lulz|having a lead singer who blew his fucking head off]].

===Pearl Jam===
[[cum|Pearl Jam]] - This turd floated to the top of the musical punch bowl after a video depicting [[Columbine|a boy shooting all of his classmates]] was aired continuously for three straight months on MTV. Since they did not have a member who ended up injecting himself with Drano like the rest of the bands, they are still together today, releasing albums with [[batshit insane|increasingly political]] messages. Their biggest hit was actually their cover "Last Kiss," a song of [[win]] due to depicting teen lovers crashing and [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|dying in a fire]]. Lucky enough for the world these cocksuckers now do commercials for target, you cant get more alternative than that.

===Alice In Chains===
[[bondage|Alice in Chains]] - These [[faggots]] made their living singing about the joys of [[heroin]]. Although singer Layne Staley enjoyed the treat of [[dying alone]] and not having his corpse found until someone noticed that he was missing TWO WEEKS after he died, guitarist Jerry Cantrell continues to make solo albums made of [[win]] and [[awesome]]. This band recently reformed with a [[negro]] singer, and can be found playing to massive crowds comprised of dozens of [[old]] grunge fans. 

===Soundgarden===
[[noise|Soundgarden]] - Soundgarden enjoyed the privilege of having [[Avril Lavigne|a screeching lead singer]] who ruined otherwise decent lyrics and songs. After [[fail]]ing to stick together, Chris Cornell ended up attempting to duck his shitty past by fronting [[slavery|Audioslave]] and make a soundtrack for [[Leave Bond to me|James Bond]], while the other members likely shot themselves out of sheer embarrassment. Their biggest hit, [[Goatse|Black Hole Sun]], has a video depicting a young girl with [[cum|melted vanilla ice cream]] flowing suggestively from her mouth, while [[LOL WUT|a man feeds a pet sheep]] and a [[Sick fuck|crazy housewife]] smiles and chops shit. In short, [[Truth|its a pretty fucked up video.]]

===L7===
An all girl grunge band ohboyohboyohboy! With voices mimicking undead banshees and a vocalist that looks like Michael Bolton, people are advised to stay the fuck away since their singing can cause cerebral palsy. They have songs detailing PMSes, pregnancy, periods, [[Feminazi|crotch-kicking]] and wargasms. Their dressing style has shown, earlier in the 90s, that plaid was never cool. 

===Stone Temple Pilots=== 
[[lolwut|Stone Temple Pilots]] - Moar like Stone Temple Toilets, amirite?

==Post-Grunge==

Post-Grunge is basically Grunge, but with what vanishingly little creativity it ever had sucked out of it to make it better for shitty alternative radio. While people can at least give credit to Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains all selling different kinds of shit, all Post-Grunge bands sound exactly the same as each other. Of course, since the general public are morons and have absolutely pitiful comfort zones, your average idiot laps up Post-Grunge by the bucket.

Notable Post-Grunge bands include:

* Foo Fighters - A band of [[faggots]] led by a drummer who thinks he can play guitar. It is a universally known [[bullshit|fact]] that the only reason the band has any success is because [[Dave Grohl]] used to give unsimulated fellatio to [[Kurt Cobain]] before he painted his living room red.
* Creed - Group of [[Christian|Christfags]] that sing about "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBBqjGd3fHQ seeing visions of the cross]" but claim OMG, THEY'RE NOT [[Shit|CHRISTIAN ROCK]]! Not like it matters since despite this faggotry, they still have one of the only two number one hits that grunge ever got.
* Alanis Morisette - Everybody's psycho ex-girlfriend... even though [[you]]'re a sad fuck that no self-respecting woman would ever interact with, she's still your psycho ex-girlfriend. Notable for making a song called "[[Irony|Ironic]]" that HOLY SHIT... isn't ironic at all. For her role in making the world an even [[Unfunny|unfunnier]] place by inspiring [[hipster]]s to declare everything as "ironic" and "witty" people to point out that she doesn't understand irony, she deserves an IRL death sentence.
* Nickelback - You don't really need Encyclopedia Dramatica to tell you that Nickelback is shit, do you? Jesus Christ, [[you]] must be living under a rock.
* Kr0n - A suckish [[Gay|Rage Against The Machine]] rip-off band known for playing [[musician|guitars]] and [[lame|basses]] with [[over 9000]] strings.
* Limp Bizkit - [[Diustin Biber|The Worst Band of All Time]]; known for containing the biggest [[pussy]], [[chav|whiteboy]], [[asshole]], [[George Bush|scumbag]] in the history of the world other than [[NephilimFree]]: '''''Fred Durst'''''

==Trolling Old Grunge Fans==

Fans of the movement still somehow exist today, and are typically found sitting in a [[lemonparty|circlejerk]] on numerous forums about their favorite bands from fifteen years ago. Making the following suggestions to these [[faggots|sensitive people]] is guaranteed to produce a [[srys]] reaction full of anger, [[drama]], and [[win|victory]]: 

*Claim that [[emo]] is the rightful heir to grunge faggotry. Old fans deny that the [[fail]] of emo is in any way like their own generic music, even though [[over 9000|tons]] of [[scene]] kids wear Kurt Cobain shirts in [[Lies|recognition]] that "Kurt is the [[BAWWW|pained]] grandfather of their movement". 

*State the [[Bullshit|fact]] that the popularity of grunge was due uniquely to corporate [[faggotry]] and [[forced meme|neverending MTV video replays]]. 

*Say that Kurt Cobain killed himself, since many fans still think that [[AIDS|Courtney Love]] hired somebody to do it and [[JEWS DID WTC|made the scene look like suicide]], which, incidentally wouldn't have been a hard task as any decently armed five year old could have MURDERED that pussy without a struggle.

*Point out that forum threads from members asking for Eddie Vedder to [[lolwut|pat their pregnant belly]] are insane, and that people who collect [[over 9000|shitloads]] of cruddy audience recordings of decades-old concerts are fucking [[creepy]]. 

*Ask them if they are Familiar with Madchester, the British form of grunge.

*Tell them that Tad Doyle is [[fat]] and should be killed because of this.

*Ask them why Kurt Cobain is still doing funny car insurance commercials with [[The Best|Dave Grohl]]

*Mention Bee-Girl.

*Mention the former guitarist of Screaming Trees is a [[Scientology|scientologist]].

*Accuse Pearl Jam's "Jeremy" video of prompting the [[Columbine]] and [[VTECH]] shootings. 

*Tell about how fun you think it is that Chris Cornell became [[rage|Rage Against the Machine's]] new lead singer.

*Tell them "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is a rip off of Boston's "More Than a Feeling" and that "Come As You Are" is a rip off of Killing Joke's "Eighties".

*Talking about Post-Grunge in general will piss them off, but for added [[lulz]], be sure to mention that only Creed's "With Arms Wide Open" and Nickelback's "How You Remind Me" got to number 1 while all the sacred "real grunge" bands never cracked that position ("Last Kiss" by Pearl Jam almost did, but they only covered it and it's a [[LOL WUT|power ballad]]).

*Direct them to this article.
