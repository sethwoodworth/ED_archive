Advice Japan
Advice [[Japan]] is basically just what is sounds like.  It's the [[old|latest]], [[lame|greatest]], [[gay]]est, meme to clog [[/b/]].  It ridicules Japan, Japanese culture and war crimes.
They should've used a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_chan Japanese person] instead of a piece of [[shit]].  There is no underestimating a [[newfag]].
