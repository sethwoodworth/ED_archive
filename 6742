<b>GONE LOL</b>

'''/r9k/''' (also known as '''/rk9/''',"Robot 9000", "arcanine", '''/r9gay/''', and '''/relationships9000/''') is one of the final boards added to 4chan on [[4chan#02.2F19.2F2008_-_The_Trial_boards_and_the_death_of_.2Fn.2F_-_News|February 19th, 2008]]. It is 4chan's official board for [[Faggotry|relationship advice]] discussing [[Incest|childhood memories]] and hooking up with fellow [[Basement dweller|r9friends]]. After childhood memories of [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075931/plotsummary being ræped by a robot] surfaced in therapy, [[m00t]] took a page from [http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-attacking-noise-in-chat/ Randall Munroe's blog] and created the board. It is now moderated by the aborted fetus of the aforementioned tryst, a bot named "ROBOT9000" that prevents the same image or text from being reposted [[lies|EVAR AGAIN]].
It initially showed a lot of promise as the best general discussion board on 4chan, apparently immune to [[The Cancer|the failure]] that contaminated  [[B|/b/]]. 

However, m00t's little [[:Image:Dogboner.jpg|lab experiment]] has since turned into his [[FAIL|Frankenstein's monster]], as it has since been populated with [[OVER 9000|millions and millions]] of [[angst]]y teenage [[moralfag]]s who blow their load every time they realize that what they're saying can only ever be said again with slight variation. Every topic on the board is centered around their [[liberal]], elitist [[BAW|BAWWWWWW]]fest antics, taking no care to show anything but [[contempt]] and disrespect for their [[btard|/b/tarded]] elders and superiors. The aforementioned fags [[fail|bring it]] with [[Sandwich Chef|thread sandwiches]] made of [[NORP]]s, [[Dr. Phil]], and [[AIDS]]. If you're ever in need of a good [[ROFL]], any given [[thread]] on '''/r9k/''' will turn that [[death|frown]] [[lulz|upside down]]. Mootblooooooox

As of 17 January 2011, moot deleted the /r9k/ board from 4chan. The two types of robots found refuge in their respective new homes: the robots [[Shit nobody cares about|who seek gentlemanly discussion]] went to [http://4chon.net/r9k/ the new /r9k/], which was created within an hour of moot's [[For the lulz|mercy kill]], while one other person decided to be [[Forever_alone|FOREVER ALONE]] and went to the [http://4chon.org/r9k/ other /r9k/], and the bawwfags [[virgin|who seek depressing discussion about bitches and hoes]] went to [http://bawwchan.org/ bawwchan] and now everyone is happy, forever alone, or sad(in the bawwfags case).

==The [[Gentlemen]] of /r9k/==
The term "Gentlemen" is certainly sardonic. It dates back to the days of yore when the denizens of /r9k/ would post in the manner of verbose ding-dongs in order to avoid the dreaded mute. These days, however, an influx of newfags - too new to have even been on /r9k/ since its birth, mere months ago - will refer to themselves as "robots". This influx has also meant that /r9k/ is often nothing more than /b/ with "MUTEBLOCK" on the end of every post and a few pixels changed in every image.

Initially a haven from [[The Cancer]] for [[B|battle]]-weary bonafide Oldfag [[B|/b/tards]], /r9k/ quickly became invaded with [[elitist|uppity]] [[newfags]] claiming [[Oldfag]] status and calling themselves "'''[[Gentlemen]]'''", "'''lu/r9k/ers'''", or "'''robots'''".

The influx of [[sensitive]]fags came from the likes of [[Digg]] and [[Enturbulation]] after reading of [[4chan]] due to [[Project Chanology]]. Droves of butthurt [[LJ]] and [[dA]] faggots soon followed, bringing their constant whining about [[Anonymous]] being "mean" to [[Aspies]] and other [[Camwhore|innocent victims]], [[ED]] being a racist and homophobic [[attack site]], and generally being [[hypocrisy|pots calling the niggers kettles black]]. This has [[YHBT|rankled the hackles]] of some oldfag /b/tards, resulting in some very [[:Image:R9k-bitching.png|ungentlemanly name-calling]].

It's not hard to see where this one's going: once the likes of [[B|/b/]], [[gun|/k/]], and [[hentai|/h/]] get a whiff of the [[faggotry|bunched panties]] emanating from /r9k/, [[Anonymous]] will likely [[backraid|eat its own]].

== The Rules ==

[[Image:R9k rules.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Evolution in action.]]

'''/r9k/''' is an imageboard where there are no reposts.
Rules:

'''RULES''':
[[Image:R9k bot.jpg|thumb|right|200px|gleep glop [[Hitler|zeig heil]]!!1!]]
/r9k/ is an imageboard where there are no reposts.
Rules/observations/etc:
# If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.
# The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.
# Each mute time is 2^n (thanks, mathsfags) in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, your mute time doubles each time you fuck up.
# Quotes, eg >>1, are not viewed by /r9k/. So "lolwut" and ">>2 lolwut" are the same post, in the eyes of /r9k/. (This also applies to >quotes)
# Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality is punished with the full force of the banhammer. Even testing R9K's parameters seems to draw the ire of the mods.
# Images are included. Slight changes in exif data, etc, however, seem to circumvent this rule, but like with text if you break the filter the REAL LIVE MODS will banhammer you.
# Your mute count never resets or goes backwards. (This will probably be changed eventually) Mute counts decrease slowly.
# You cannot post a picture without text.
# Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).
# The too low in content filter was broken for a while, resulting in a lot of crappy mutes. Sorry. Mods have twice reset the mute counts because of this.
# Post sane, real content, well thought out replies, and mutes are unlikely.
# The original algorithm was designed by XKCD: http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-attacking-noise-in-chat/
# /r9k/ cannot [[Suicide|self-terminate]].

== How to troll /r9k/ ==
/r9k/ is one of the easiest boards to troll. Known methods for trolling include:

* Say Atheists are wrong and gay.
* Say abortions are wrong
* Say you're from /b/.
* Say you're from [[ED]].
* Express conservative or racist opinions.
* Express liberal opinions.
* [[Guro]] or [[Shock Image]]s - Gentlemen are not true [[Anonymous]], and thus have not been hardened to the [[zippocat|realities of the world]].
* Post as a girl.
* Post as <font color=red>[[Namefag|Pepe, Peepe, P3epe, P3eepe]]</font>, or any of the variants; This is guaranteed to make you a successful troll.
* Bring up a moral debate about child pornography. 

Any of these guarantee [[at least 100]] posts.

== Workarounds (Muteblocking) ==

[[Image:Awesome-O.jpg|thumb|200px|[[m00t]] prepares to be boarded by his latest creation.]]

When the board was first created, you could work around the bot for text by quoting a few previous replies as this added uniqueness to your post. The [[Nazis|mods]] quickly fixed this part of the code and the bot now [[rapes|strip]]s quotes and replies before running the post through the [[Internet hate machine|database.]] 

Images can be reposted by changing the exif data, resizing, using a HEX editor, etc. before reposting. However, there are still actual mods on /r9k/, and they will issue swift and painful [[banhammer]]s to anyone who would oppose the new robot overlord.

The most common cheat is known as muteblocking. Just add "muteblock" (or mootblock or any other variation) at the end of your post. This only works if the post is a [[Spam|short one]] because the robot only checks the first thirty some characters of the message. For [[copypasta]], one must muteblock at the beginning.

Although technically you could get [[b&]], the [[mods]] don't seem to give a shit anymore.

== Differences from /b/ ==
* The chaps of /r9k/ consider themselves to be far more sophisticated than the rabble of /b/, and refer to themselves as "[[Gentlemen]]". [[old meme|Of course, being the smartest and most sophisticated of the users on 4chan is roughly equivalent to winning gold at the Special Olympics]]. Another somewhat popular label is "lu/r9k/ers," which is a gross misrepresentation, since the majority of /r9k/ users are more likely to lurk [[LiveJournal|LJ]] than [[4chan]].
* /r9k/ gets far less traffic than /b/. While this does amount to fewer posts, it has its advantages. For instance, one can have actual discussions on /r9k/ without the thread being spammed by forced memes and kicked to page 10 by unoriginal material and camwhores.  
* The most obvious difference is, of course, that /b/ has had absolutely no original content whatsoever for about two and a half years. /r9k/, on the other hand, has nothing but [[Bullshit|fresh, new, and never-before-seen material]].
[[Image:R9kelitistfags.jpg|825px|center]]
* As seen above, /r9k/ users are far more [[Liberalism|politically correct]] and [[Waaaambulance|sensitive]] than average /b/tards. (Basically meaning they frequently say [[DOING_IT_WRONG|coons]] instead of [[niggers]]. [[Lolwut|This really makes a massive difference.]]
* [[E-psychiatrist|E-psychiatry]] is common practice on /r9k/ and it's never difficult to find an [[trying too hard|overzealous]] or [[attention whore|enthusiastic]] "troll" (the term is used loosely in this instance) offering an FBI profile on any given poster. If you're feeling [[emo|depressed]] or have any [[Closet Furry|personal issues]], /r9k/ has an [[13 year old boy|army]] of individuals ready to [[fellatio|serve your needs]] around the [[cock|clock]].

== RIP /r9gay/ ==

[[Image:Moot-rape.jpg|thumb|right|m00t being ræped by '''r9000''''s daddy.]]

[[Image:R9ktrolledmoot.PNG|thumb|right|moot realizes what the rest of us knew months ago.]]

Like all boards on [[4chan]], /r9k/ is not without its [[Cancer|problems]]. Because the board's population is made of [[aspie]] [[nice guys]] and [[white knight]]s, /r9k/ has not generated any worthwhile [[meme]]s or even anything mildly [[lulzy]] over the course of its lifespan.

However, it still functions as a moderately good discussion board, and is still a good idea in theory. While one may still have to wade through a knee-deep pool of shit to get to the good content, this is really no different than any [[b|other board]] on 4chan.  How long the board will stay in its current condition is unknown, but the fact that the board went from great to rather shitty in about two months is not exactly a testament to its potential.

[[Image:R9kdailythreadbreakdown.jpg|thumb|left|[[Original content]], [[amirite]]?]]

4chan's crack team of [[Nerd|experts]] has yet to determine how long the board will last in its current state. However, given how long /b/ has managed to survive while being terminally ill with cancer shows that there is still some hope for /r9k/. The best solution, obviously, would be for some sort of actual [[Mods|moderation]] and [[chemo]] on the part of [[moot]] and the 4chan mods. Of course, knowing moot, it is perfectly reasonable to expect two more [[World War III|World Wars]] and an [[Global Warming|Ice Age]] before any real help is provided.

Followup studies are grim, showing that /r9k/ has been fully overtaken by relationship bullshit, dating advice, and hookup threads. Yes, you read correctly, [[Gaia|fucking hookup threads]]. /r9k/ is also full of long-assed threads with "Is ED down or what?" every time [[ED is slow|ED breaks for a few seconds]], that get about 200 replies from both anonymous and tripfags. 

[[Last Thursday|Recently]] [[moot]] announced, via a sticky, that he was planning on setting up an individual relationshit board on 4chan. IF this happens, /r9k/ might get slightly less [[faggot]]ty for a while. Plus, newfags will have a whole new board to [[troll]]. Everybody wins. Except not, as /r9k/ sucks anyway, and the relationshit posters would come back after they realize that threads in their personal LiveJournal board don't get many replies.

For now, the future of /r9k/ remains uncertain. But I think you ought to know /r9k/'s feeling very [[depressed]].

'''UPDATE:'''  With the creation of /adv/ice for the s/adv/irgins and /sci/ for the /sci/ducks, some tolerable level of lulz have indeed surfaced on /r9k/, much like bacteria covered in polysaccharides float to the top of a wastewater plant.  With the reappointing of several briefly-retired janitors and at least one full-time mod in /k/ and several previously hidden boards mainstreaming and drawing off the newfags, the board is getting back on its boil-strewn legs. /r9k/ is nothing but "Ask a (insert type of person different from lonely virgin here/lonely virgin)", relationship/sex advice and kids worrying about penis inspection day.
<br />
'''UPDATE:''' As of 1/17/11 /r9gay/ is no longer a part of 4chan. [[moot]] said this is because all of the Robots are whiny, pussy faggots, [[Brb soup|and then he went to make soup]].
