Exhibit B-5
{{stub}}
'''Exhibit B-5''' aka '''Girl Dies''' is a video on JewTube of a purported [[prank]] gone wrong ending in the death of a girl that went [[viral]] in September [[2010]]. It is presented as a video entered into evidence during a [[lolsuit|court case]] that [[OP]]'s father adjudicated. [[tl;dw]]? see [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKjsUL-escE&t=3m13s '''&t=3m13s''']

After being reposted all over the place and the following shitstorm of [[ZOMG|heated debate]] and [[flaming|analysis]], it was [[pwnt|summarily dismissed]] as a fake.

==The Truth==
The fact that anyone would a). allow the death of a family member to be uploaded to YouTube and b). that evidence in an ongoing [[lolsuit]] would be allowed on YouTube didn't seem to strike anyone as odd and the shit hit the fan as it circulated the Internets. The truth, however, is that it was a short film from a wannabe director named [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kyle_Rankin&direction=next&oldid=380667580 Kyle Rankin].

The 'dead girl' posted [http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=219538&id=49938117634 this on her Failbook]. 

{{tinyquote|Originally shot as a 4 minute short film, the 'court case' reference in the beginning of Exhibit B-5 is supposed to be the "backstory" of the short film. Please note that the uploader of the video never posted 'not fake' on the video, other people who stole the video from youtube uploaded only the last minute and posted the 'not fake' words in the title.

I am an actress and was contacted by the director to play the role. I did not have the idea, write, direct, OR upload the video. I didn't do it to boost my career, for example, I didn't sit down and think "Hey, I need to get on a crazy video." It was simply a job and like any acting job, I gave it my best effort. I am very blessed to have worked with this team. It ended up looking much more realistic than I thought it would. We have all seen accidents in films, but I didn't think it was going to look like Brad Pitt's 'Meet Joe Black'. No dolls were used and I can't say exactly how we did it, but I did have to lay on top of and underneath the car. I have to applaud the special effects team for creating it so realistically, but I do have to say that the first time I saw it I was shocked. And if you got emotional in any way (saddened, cried, angered, scared, laughed) then I did my job as an actress.

This was not a reenactment of any case, not a real story, not a promo for anything, not a marketing ploy for any video recorder and not a clip of a full length feature film.|Cindy Velal}}
