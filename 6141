=== Hosting ===
*http://www.hightechhost.net is a new Hosting Company run by one of the g00ns. They offer DDoS Protection and Offshore Hosting, and are very cheap compared to most hosts. I encourage all Anons to patronize them.
*The shopping cart is currently down, so go to #hightechhost on [irc://irc.efnet.net/ EFnet] and PM tribal if you want hosting.

==Freenet for Anonymous==
The irc server above has a channel called #freenet. there, you can swap noderefs. Don't know what they r? u r noob, but i forgive. You can have freenet, too. Go to [http://freenetproject.org/download.html the Freenet site] and download the one for your operating system. go through the setup wizard that appears in your web browser.

DO NOT ADD THE 5 "FREE" FRIENDS! we want this network to ONLY have Anonymous.

Done? find out your [http://moanmyip.com ip address]. go back to your [http://127.0.0.1:8888/ freenet homepage] and click "configuration." scroll down to the "ip hint" paste it there. submit the page.

go to the friends link. scroll down and click teh "as text" link. COPY THE RESULTING PAGE AS-IS. Go to a [http://pastebin.ca pastebin]. paste your noderef info to it. see how the link for that is http://pastebin.ca/[a number] ? change it to http://pastebin.ca/raw/[a number]. COPY that url.

In the freenet irc channel... see if anyone is around.. and, if so, offer to swap refs. if they agree, paste them that last url you copied. they'l give you a url. on your freenet homepage, click "friends" again. paste that url your anonymous friend gave you into the appropriate place, and click submit.

Done.

NOTE: IF YOU AND YOUR NEW FRIEND ARE BEHIND A NAT, IT WILL NOT WORK. IF YOU DID EVERYTHING RIGHT, AND YOUR FRIEND DID EVERYTHING RIGHT, AND YOU DON'T CONNECT, THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM. but if just one of you is NATted, you're good to go.
