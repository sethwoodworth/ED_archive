'''Pool's closed''' is a [[catchphrase]], usually referring to the existence of [[AIDS]] in the pool. It is uttered [[over 9000|frequently]] by the [[Patriotic Nigras|13-year-old-boys]] when they "close pools" [[Butthurt|for health and safety reasons]]. 

Why would [[nigra|13-year-old-boys]] all across the [[internet|basement]] risk their lives for such a cause? Because at heart, nigras just want to preserve the habitat of tremendously busty chicks, as shown [http://www.xvideos.com/video3190/Liana_Smiss_in_Pool_Fantasy_at_Busty_Adventures here].

==A fictional case==
A <s>fictional case</s> real case of a pool being closed in Sterling High School due to AIDS, but the media elite chooses to spit in the face of the proudest aspects of black identity and rob the nigras of honor by having white actors play the pool-closing authorities, when in real life this hazardous and essential community service is performed by an almost exclusively black brotherhood.
