Nerd
[[Image:Gamer.png|thumb|right|333px|A [[typical]] nerd looking at [[porn]] in mom's basement]]
A '''nerd''' is essentially an [[ugly]], [[Anthropophobia|anthropophobic]] [[luser]], often [[fat]] and / or a [[basement-dweller]], who is [[obsession|obsessed]] with and quite knowledgeable about a particular, non-mainstream hobby. In practice they are essentially like [[geek]]s, except that they are even less socially adjusted. Thus, unlike geeks, nerds are notoriously easy to pick out of a crowd — one need only listen for the person who is prattling on endlessly about a subject of little interest to anyone else, or who only wears t-shirts that they purchased at last week's [[convention]]. They also just so happen to [[you fail it|fail it]] at [[socializing]] (except perhaps with other attendees of said convention).They are <s>not</s> neutral at [[Mudkipz]] and the most of all,they are 100% offended in [[ED]](nerds have no [[lulz]]).



==The Nerd Kingdom==

The term "nerd" is merely the genus of a vast variety of social degenerates; there exist, under the broad categorization of the term, many species of nerd that are determined based on collective nicknames. A nerd who is obsessed with masturbating to pictures of scantily-clad elves in their parents' basement is a [[role-playing]] nerd, for example, whereas a nerd is who is obsessed with [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] and [[LJDrama]] is a [[drama whore]] nerd. Nerds that spend all their time immersed in a particular [[canon]] work or [[fandom]] are [[fangirl]]s, even if they are [[man|male]]. In this latter instance, fangirls are divided up even further based on their chosen fandom — ''[[Star Trek]]'' nerds are called "Trekkies", ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' nerds are called "Ringers", and so on.
Other major nerd species include, but are not limited to, nerds who compulsively update their [[OL]] [[journal]]s (alternately called "bloggers" and [[LJ user]]s); nerds who spend all their time writing [[slashfic]] ("slashers"); nerds who go to every convention in a 1,000-mile radius ("regulars"); nerds who cannot get off without looking at girls being [[rape]]d by [[Tentacle rape|tentacles]] ("[[otaku]]", or [[sick fuck]]s); and nerds who live out their fantasy lives through bad [[fanfic]] writing ("[[Suethors]]").
Some nerds just know, through some mystical sense that they can't quite put their finger on, that they are very [[Retard|special]]. If they are lucky enough to be the children of new age [[hippies]], they might be labeled [[Indigo Children]].

A nerd will also try to redeem their integrity by making whiny, passive-aggressive entires on Urban Dictionary, Uncyclopedia etc. Nerds convince themselves into a [[delusion]] that making self-adulating statements to strangers on the internet is helping their case. They also have a false, self-regarding sense of superiority that is an obvious defense mechanism stemming from the bitterness of being chosen last in gym class. True geniuses such as Nikola Tesla are rolling over in their graves over a nerd's delusion that overindulging in non-important activities (video games, anime etc) is a hallmark of astronomical intelligence. But of course, their social ineptitudes and self-diagnosed [[Aspergers]] are entirely the faults of people who have actually had [[sex]] before. Due to being locked in their bedrooms covered by black bedsheets, a nerd is entirely unaware of the contingent of non-nerds who have also accomplished great things.

== [[Warhammer]] Nerds ==
Warhammer Nerds are like any other nerds in the way that they have no hope of ever getting [[secks|laid]], but they are also different because they contribute to society. Warhammer Nerds contribute to society because they have high paying jobs due to their need for money for Warhammer where each plastic tank costs at least $70.

This makes Warhammer different from other nerd activities like ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' where 40 year old [[virgin]]s in their parents' basements not doing any work for society. Warhammer Nerds work for the greater good by leaving their houses, getting jobs, and rapidly advancing the career ladder to get $300 for a plastic artillery battery.

Many Warhammer Nerds play ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]''.

[[Image:Realnerds.gif|thumb|right|Hipsters have been stealing nerd culture and turning it cool, hip, and even ironic.  Nerds are now at risk of being confused with people who care more about how they look then about science or science ficition.  Beware!]]
==[[Liberals|Political Nerds]]==
There is nothing worse than coming across a Political Nerd. Political nerds believe they are unquestionable political pundits despite a lack any of knowledge of the topic at hand.  Often the extent of their political knowledge is from a post by someone on a forum or a [http://www.wimp.com/crashers/ video created as a joke]. [[Over 9000]] nerds are [[libertarian]]s.

==Mating Habits==
[[Image:450px-DerHexer.png|thumb|A prime example of Wikipedia Nerd.]]
Most have no [[Sex|mating]] habits since they are incapable of copulation. One exception is band nerds, who are the rabbits of the nerd world because of their uncon[[troll]]able horniness

However, all nerds have [[Masturbation|vestigial behaviors]] related to mating in their evolutionary past which had something to do with watching explosions in space.

==King of Nerds==
Rob (known as Seto Kaiba on his [[Yu-Gi-Oh|Yi-Gi-Oh]] site) is the true king of nerds. As the admin of [http://Seto-Kaiba.com/ Seto-Kaiba.com], he spends countless hours tending to his website and pretending not to still enjoy a dead card game/children's cartoon. He is not JUST a nerd. He is also a large [[Pedobear|childcare enthusiast]]. He has a girlfriend, but she's mentally retarded, so she doesn't really count.

==LOL IM SUCH A NERD "nerd"==
[[Image:Lookoutfororange.jpg|thumb|LOL I SURCH A NEEERD.]]
[[emo|Faggots]] that find it.. cool to call themselves "nerds".  Fact 1- [[Lie|They are never nerds.]]  Fact 2-  Their breath usually smells like [[Piss|pee.]]  Go on AIM, and talk to a [[Girl|chick.]]  Its all going so well, but than you ask her what she's doing.  She responds "Im reading [[TOW|Wikipedia]].  LOL IM SUCH A NERD"  You than respond with a simple "[[lol]]" which really means, you are the most average, non-interesting, fuckup I have ever talked to.

==Nerds who succeed in life ==
NO Joke, No [[FAIL]], NO [[SHIT]]. Consult the megacorporate hi-tech gurus [[Bill Gates]] and [[Steve Jobs]], and former vice president [[Al Gore]] rank high in nerdiness, he claims to invented the INTRNTZ.
