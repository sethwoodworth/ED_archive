{{quote|This is just another iteration of the same bullshit that features a person or animal in the center, some faggity kaleidoscope design with different colors or different shades of color, and a line of words at the top and a line of words at the bottom. This is not new or original in the slightest. Every since Advice Dog popped into the scene, this shit just spread like wildfire. None of this shit is worth saving, and anyone who perpetuates this garbage needs to die.| Anon speaks the [[truth]]}}
