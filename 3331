Gimmeabreakman

'''Gimmeabreakman''' (aka Victor from Japan), represents the quintessential [[lol]]anus hub of every tortured [[weeaboo]]. When he is not busy showboating his disturbing love for [[Superman]], Victor can be found: pretending to live in [[Japan]], whoring for attention on [[YouTube]], and fantasizing about his [[IRL]] friend [[Applemilk1988]]. Essentially, Victor is a renowned [[internet]] narc and [[drama whore]]. [[Some argue]] Victor's not that bad of a guy; which is FALSE. Victor is a duplicitous [[douchebag]]. Victor was [[notable]] for being a part-time pal of [[anonymous]], and can be currently can be found [[Incontinent Student Bodies|bawwwwwwwww]]ing in his [[emo]] corner with [[Rickroll]]ers. [[You]] can [[halp]] by reminding Victor that "復讐は風邪に役立つ皿のベストである".

Most of Victor's [[YouTube]] videos are either about [[hack]]ers or [[drama]]. Gimmeabreakman is notable for lacking a sense of [[humor]],  and his inability to comprehend the [[rules of the internet]]. Victor claims to be a teacher as well as having a real life friendship with [[Applemilk1988]]. 
Victor (Gimmeabreakman) claims his entire existence on YouTube is to "promote other Youtubers" whilst at the same time providing no discernible talent or value to justify his subscription base, which is of course misleading in the first place as he was put on Youtube's signup page in early 2007 (he was also made Youtube's guest editor in '''March''' 2007).  He is one of the more notable subscriptions [[whores]] on Youtube as he was was a reformed "[[hater]]," who used to attack other users (most notably [[Blunty3000]] and [[Ian Crossland]]) purely for numbers and [[attention whore|attention]].  
While it remains unclear how Victor's make-believe [[Azn|wife]] feels about all of this, it is clear that, unlike Applemilk, Victor is far from even being [[internet famous]].

Forunately enough for Victor he has several [[fan]]s, such as [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=TheFriendlyGeek TheFriendlyGeek]. He also has a potential girlfriend, [http://www.youtube.com/biblegirl7 Lisa the biblegirl7].

All arguably funny!|Gimmeabreakman on his serious lack of humor}}

==Gimmeabreakman vs. Fakesagan==
After [[Fakesagan]] got [[banned]] from YouTube it seems he chose continue "pownage" from afar at his new home(s) on [[shit|revver]] (and [[TAA]]'s website) and had some thoughts on Victor...

<video type="revver" id="1717280" width="420" height="360" frame="true" position="center"/>

==YouTube Suicide==

In his latest drunk video (and sad attempt at [[attention whoring]] to get views), it seems like our favorite [[Mexican|Peruvian]] is retiring. Basically, he pretended to give out his password, and "anybody who gets his account, gets it". He's really just whining about not getting enough views. [[Seriously|For real]].

Some new, has-no-subscribers-yet-is-better-looking-than-Victor dude '''with straight teeth''' is in control of the Gimmeabreakman account now. WHICH IS A FUCKING LIE, because Victor was always in control. If anybody believes this isn't a cry for attention from Victor to simply get more views... '''they're idiots''' and should [[an hero]].

===Victor's Award===

Victor is a jerkoff. In fact, he's ''such'' a fucking jerkoff, that he is now ''the'' biggest jerkoff, and has thus won an award for it.
