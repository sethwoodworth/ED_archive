'''Adnan Oktar''' (aka '''Harun Yahya''' aka '''cocksucker''') is a [[batshit insane]], [[Anti-semitism|anti-Zionist]], [[Turkish]], [[Muslim]] [[Creationist]]. He believes that [[Evolution]] is a [[lie]] created by [[Freemasons]] in an evil conspiracy to destroy human morals and [[religion]]. He also believes in an odd combination of [[Turkey|Turanism]] and [[wikipedia:Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamism]] in which [[Turkey]] in the center of an empire. Oktar attempts to spread his ideas through [[book]]s and the [[Internet]]. Oktar also suffers from bad case of [[Unwarranted Self-Importance]] and wears a suit and sometimes sunglasses in all of his photos.

Yahya is known for having a [[harem]] of [[Pedophilia|children]] (which includes [[fag|boys]] too). During his trial in 1992 his justification was being [[fact|mentally deranged]]. His defence was accepted and he spent the 90s in mental hospital.

Yet there are many muslims that accept Yahya's words as fact.  Such as: [[faggot|Yiğit Bulut]], [[homo|Oktar Babuna]] and [[cocksucker|Cihat Gündoğdu]]. Some of them call themselves [[Divide by zero|muslim scientists]].


==Role in Internet Censorship==

Yahya is resposible for [[Yarly|banned websites]] in Turkey, such as: youtube, vimeo, richarddawkins.com, ek$isozluk and so on. [[confused|Somehow]] neiher 4chan nor encyclopedia is banned. 

==Beliefs==
Oktar claims to be anti-materialistic. He believes that one's love of worldly possessions conflict with one's spirituality. He claims that materialism destroys one's spirituality and humanity. Materialism is also one of the many sources for war, such nations tend to fight for wealth, resources, and land (eg. [[oil]]). Despite this, Oktar is against [[Buddhism]]. Buddhists can be described as the less materialistic people on the world. They don't own anything, they don't desire wealth, and they wear only robes. Oktar, on the other hand, has a lot of money and wears fancy clothes and jewelry.




===Conspiracies!===
Oktar also believes that [[Freemasons]] control the world and the development of society. Oktar claims that the Masons are attempting to spread the concept of materialism. Of course, Oktar doesn't realize that an underground conspiracy isn't necessary to spread materialism. Materialism and greed exists since the start of [[Human]] history. People naturally seek wealth (sometimes at the expense of spirituality). Simply put, a person would most likely want to become a [[Bill Gates|successful businessperson]] than a [[priest]].

Oktar also believes that the Knights Templar were a part of a conspiracy. According to Oktar, the Knights Templar's main priority was to acquire wealth rather than protecting Christian pilgrims. Eventually, the Knights Templar became even better at banking than the Jews, and the Knights became the wealthiest group in Europe. Since the Knights Templar were the best bankers around, everyone, including European monarchs, took loans from the order. Eventually, the Europeans monarchs become so much indebted to the Knights Templar that they were afraid that the order would use the debt in order to hold their kingdoms hostage. Thinking in a similar manner as Oktar (and all Templar conspiracy-theorists in general), the [[Hitler|monarchs]] began to believe that the [[Jews|Templars]] were up to no good, so [[Holocaust|they betrayed and killed them]]. Oktar also accuses the Templars of [[homosexuality]] and being [[Satanists]].

He also accuses the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians, the [[Illuminati]], as the successors of the Knights Templar, for crimes. Despite the fact that each Freemason hopeful must state that they believe in a single divine entity that guides that world, Oktar believes that the Freemasons are actually [[Wicca|Occultists]]. Oktar claims that Freemasons and the Illuminati engineered for the French Revolution, which they used as a catalyst for vast world change and for obtaining vengeance against the French monarchs who killed hundreds of Templars. Oktar apparently believes that ''[[wikipedia:From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (the film) is fact rather than fiction, and he believes that Jack the Ripper was a Freemason.

==His Site: [http://www.darwinism-watch.com/ www.darwinism-watch.com]==

Darwinism-watch is a site which makes [[youtube]] creationists look logical and rational by comparison. Part of the reason it is so [[retarded]] is because the creator of the site, Adnan Oktar Agustos (who, by the way, looks alot like a fucking Bond Villain) is a strange mutation of double-[[lolcow]], being both a creationist and a [[Muslim|raghead]]. 

Not only is Oktar is a Creationist, he believes that evolution and [[intelligent design]] in be false theories created by Freemasons in order to weaken faith. If you been on forums, they've heard every argument for or against evolution, but Oktar's techniques in "disproving" evolution are bizarre. He believes that his extremely large picturebook (''The Atlas of Creation'') disproves evolutions by comparing fossils to present-day animals and saying that they hasn't changed since "creation". This, along with his conspiracy theories, are really the only explanation he has for his beliefs.

One also has to ask why a site which hates evolution so much decorates it's banner with images of Charles Darwin and fossils.
