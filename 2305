[[Image:Goth walrus lawyers.jpg|thumb|right]][[image:Bars.jpg|thumb|left]]{{lj|dncingmalkavian}} is a [[Fat whore|woman]] who prides herself into being one of [[Shit nobody cares about|a multitude of talents]].  Her talents range from being a [[E-lawyer|legal expert]], a [[Internet Disease|model]] and last but not least, a musician who writes [[Meaningless noise|such decadent and insightful EBM music]].  Dncingmalkavian takes herself too seriously, and this is due to certain factors : She's a [[Art|wannabe artist]] and [[The Internet is serious business|the internet is serious fucking business]] for her.  

Be careful, don't make a [[macro]] of her, or she'll [[Cry|report]] you to [[LJ Abuse]], thus resulting in your [[Goth macros|beloved community]] getting [[Banned|fucked up the ass]].

When she's not recording [[Shitty|crappy]] music, or [[Butthurt|obsessively searching]] for [[macros]] of her photos, she's off doing "photoshoots" with the photographers in the [http://www.olanmills.com/ Olan Mills Portrait Studio] at her local [[Wal-Mart]].


==dncingmalkavian's Origins==

There are some speculations about her being an [[Fat|Amazonian]], but it has been recently discovered that she is, indeed, a [[Lol-cow|LOLrus]], hence her [http://www.myspace.com/oceanbornmuse OceanBorn Muse] moniker in which she performs her [[shitty]] [[Meaningless noise|music]] under.  

Both her and her pal [http://zigamorph.livejournal.com/ Zigamorph] are notoriously known throughout the [[Livejournal]] [[Goth]] [[Scene]] for taking communities like <s>{{ljcomm|user=goth_macros}}</s> and <s>{{ljcomm|user=gothic_tards}}</s> too seriously, both of where they were mocked ceaselessly, and both were completely responsible for their [[Banned|grisly demise]].

[[Butthurt|together]], they both create music under the OceanBorn Muse moniker.


==Her Rise To Fame==

[[Image:Dncbucket.jpg|thumb|150px| The macro that started it all by [[user:clintiskeen|clintiskeen]]]]"On April 25th, 2008, the livejournal user dncingmalkavian entered into a whole world of [[butthurt]] and infamy. Someone found [http://community.livejournal.com/gothic_babes/8443319.html a series of pics of her] on the [[http://community.livejournal.com/gothic_babes Gothic Babes]] camera-whore community. Initially, dncingmalkavian "claimed" that she was being a [http://community.livejournal.com/goth_macros/421326.html?thread=4138446#t4138446 "a pretty good sport about this whole thing"] until the infamous livejournal user [[user:clintiskeen|clintiskeen]] posted his walrus macro, unleashing the wrath of a [[Goth]][[fatty]]." -- Quoted from the [[Goth macros]] article.

==Her groupies==

[[image:Tcj dm.jpg|thumb|left]]In one of her more [[LOL|amusing]] [[Flame wars|encounters]] with [[Goth macros]], a [[13-year-old boy|groupie]] of her's, {{lj|curlyjester}} chimed in and told everyone to "[[lolwut|go shit in a teacup]]"  After many, many [[lulz]] were had, [http://curlyjester.livejournal.com/3077.html it was later uncovered] that he is just an [[Emo|angsty]] kid that, just like any other gits his age, hates his parents and has a self-diagnosed [[Internet disease|condition]] of [[Butthurt|Bi-Polar]] :
