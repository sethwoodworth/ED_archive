Original research
{{crapstub}}<br><br>

{{notice|[[Wikipedia:Water|Wikipedia's water article]] does not claim that water is wet. It mentions the words have similar etymology, and it mentions wetlands, but nowhere in the article does it state that water is wet.}}

Unlike [[Wikipedia|That Other Wiki]], on Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica you are allowed to make outlandish claims like "water is wet" or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:You_do_need_to_cite_that_the_sky_is_blue "the sky is blue"] without citing scientific studies proving it.  Also unlike TOW, we would encourage you to cite actual scientific studies (if we cared, which we don't) because TOW usually just ends up citing The New York Post instead of actual verifiable studies or resources. Using original research for your article = not allowed. Citing a ''website'' that utilized original research = GO FUCKING WILD. The [[logic]] here is staggering.  The practical meaning of TOW's policies is that articles have to be built mainly of links to other articles and [[Citation_needed|citations]] instead of ideas.  At ED, you can make an article with real sentences that you made up yourself, or you can borrow sentences from scientists.  Your choice.  

Original research is [[the best]], and often the only way to ensure the most efficient [[corruption of LOL]] when dealing with drama on the internets. [[lolcow|Some individuals]] require extensive amounts of blood, sweat and semen to fully document the extent of their [[e-fame|e-infamy]]. TOW's lack of original research is a fatal flaw in its [[James Watson|genetic makeup]] that ensures that it will forever be mired in too much [[Serious Fucking Business]], i.e, they will never come to understand the simple joy of the lulz.

==Doing the Math==

If A = B and B = C, then A only equals C if The [[New York]] Post or [[MONGO]] says it is true.
