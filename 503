Animegao

At some point in time, [[weeaboos]] came to the horrifying realization that they weren't keeping up with furries in terms of sick-fuckery and employed an expert team of perverts to tackle this problem. The solution was '''animegao''', or 'the [[wapanese]] [[fursuit]]'. Just as furries rape your eyes with their cum-stained costumes, weeaboos have provided a way for you to go blind in horror by dressing up as their favorite anime characters. While this may sound exactly like [[cosplay|cosplaying]], it differs in the fact that the weeaboo, or 'doller', in question leaves absolutely no skin showing. A full anime-style mask bathes the [[ugly|doller]] in complete [[anonymous|anonymity]], which means that the person underneath may be a man, an [[obese]] man, or even an [[80 year old Chinese man in panties]]. [[lie|This wouldn't be so bad]] if it weren't for the fact that nearly all animegao costumes are female. 

== Origins ==
[[Image:Animegao3.jpg|thumb|left|Somewhere underneath this fabric is a shriveled, unwashed penis.]]
As can be expected, animegao originated in the godless shitpile that is [[Japan]]. Eager young basement-dwellers from the superior Western world [[x in my pants|came in their pants]] as soon as they found a new way to disguise their lumpy, pale bodies, and so the trend spread like [[herpes]] through [[Europe]] and the [[USA]]. While animegao remains somewhat obscure within most [[loser|cosplaying]] [[circlejerk|circles]], its popularity will inevitably skyrocket as weeaboos learn that they can cover their acne-ridden faces with [[ugly|smooth]], [[creepy|beautiful]] anime masks.

== Components of the Suit ==

As mentioned earlier, the purpose of the animegao suit is to hide the fat rolls and asymmetrical face of the wearer. It does this by covering every single inch of the disfigured gnome within. Each [[plastic crap|suit]] comes in two parts- the bodysuit, which is also called a [[hentai|zentai]], and, of course, the mask. While a regular cosplay outfit can cost a couple of dollars with some creativity, each part of the animegao costume is profoundly [[expensive]]. Bodysuits may run from $50-$200, and even the cheapest mask is at least $600. These outrageous prices ensure that only the most [[insane|determined]] [[sick|cosplay]] [[fuck|enthusiasts]] participate in the subculture, as only the truly dedicated can save enough from their [[welfare]] checks to buy these outrageously expensive outfits. It must be noted that all body suits come with zippers upon the crotch and ass, an innovation undoubtedly swiped from [[furry|another bizarre fandom]]. Dollers may also attach [[no|sexy]] accessories to their costumes, such as [[no|anatomically accurate]] [[dildo|plastic penises]] and [[no|supple]] fake tits.   


== Fetishism ==

It is no surprise that animegao is yet another sick [[fetish]] manufactured by Japan. [[bullshit|While some dollers find no sexual satisfaction in wearing a full anime bodysuit]], many of them can barely zip the costume up without [[i came|blowing a load]]. Most dollers are men, and climbing into an animegao costume is the closest to being inside a woman that any of them will ever be. It is no wonder that these men love having sex with other men within these costumes. However, it remains unclear as to whether these [[faggots|knob-jockeys]] are men who get off on being [[dyke|lesbians]], men who get off on being [[dickgirl|dickgirls]], or men who are simply [[faggots]].

== Animegao Porn ==

Although animegao is a fetish-based [[cult|subculture]] to the core, there is relatively little porn involving it. This may be due to the fact that even most niche fetishists find it so strange that even their weathered cocks won't raise to it. There are, however, many videos on youtube of masked sissy-men showing off their [[fucked up|sexy]] costumes.
