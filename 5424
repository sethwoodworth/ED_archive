'''Misanthropik''' is an article thief who copies and pastes artices from Encyclopedia Dramatica into [http://xanga.com/misanthropik her Xanga], (note: locked as of time of writing, she will unlock it eventually) and then removes any mention of ED, and also changes words like internets to internet, to make it look like she wrote them.

Her Xanga had four posts when it was unlocked, two of which were articles from here, [[emo]] and [[attention whore]], and then two posts that were two sentences long that [[your mom]] wrote for her in exchange for [[buttsecks]].  

Misanthropik is also some Scandinavian death metal band, which has been around since at least [[last Thursday]].  

It is likely that this article will be stolen by Misanthropik sooner or later.
