Christopher Hitchens
[[Image:Hitchens2.jpg|right|thumb|Class]]

[[Christopher Hitchens]], aka "a drink-soaked former Trotskyist popinjay", is an [[atheist]] anti-religious [[troll]] and staunch supporter of the [[Iraq|Iraq War]]. His [[Christian]] brother Peter, who works for [[Nazi|Pat Buchanan]], opposes the Iraq War. Hitchens [[Bullshit|states the obvious]]: that religion is the cause of almost every conflict, and "poisons everything." After all, it's not as though religion has ever been used by elites to motivate [[NORP|the great unwashed]] while circumstances related to capital and resources were the actual causes of corruption and widespread conflict.

Hitchens' [[Fat|corpulence]] is the result of his insatiable appetite for deep fried [[cock]]stuffed certified halal Iraqi babies and booze.

He is very commonly known for tipping a few back, as he did before approaching journalist Greg Palast and belching, "[[George Bush]] was right about everything he said about [[Iraq]]!"

Hitchens' gradual decline from an intelligent, thoughtful journalist and the author of many well-researched books that butchered sacred cows like [[Whore|Mother Teresa]] and [[Henry Kissinger]] into a politico-fawning, thoroughly sloshed [[faggot]]ron is evident from even a cursory examination of his sizable body of work. Ever since Hitchens discovered that [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/apr/14/politics he's a whopping 1/32nd Jewish], he's swiftly transformed from a moderate critic of Israel into a slobbering [[Neocon]] [[Zionist]].

Having left The Nation, the one semi-decent news magazine in all of America over the past half-century, Hitchens now serves drinks at [[The Man|Imperialist-apologist Western Elite Cafe]], which is located in [[Yuppie|SOHO]]. In his spare time, he and fellow atheist [[Richard Dawkins]] suck each other off in hotel rooms.

In a stunning and unexpected twist of events, Christopher Hitchens has recently been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, almost certainly caused by his copious intake of booze and tobacco. The only silver lining in his heavy cloud is that he's immune to the question, "[[Where is your god now?]]"

Despite his many flaws, Hitchens is a gifted and [[lulz]]y troll, especially when televised. In the following clips, he trolls [[Women|wymyn]], [[Christfags]], [[Faggot|Bill Maher]] and [[Drunk|himself]]:

And they've taken as their own, as their representative American, someone ([[Michael Moore]]) who actually embodies all of those qualities.|Hitchens, in a rare moment of clarity|What can be asserted without proof can be dismissed without proof.|Hitchens on [[bullshit|Religion]]|It is the most revolting, and utter, and absolute, and heartless tyranny the human species has ever evolved. But at least you can fucking die and leave [[Evildoer Korea|North Korea]].|Hitchens on Religious Totalitarianism| If you're actually certain that you're hitting only a concentration of enemy troops... then it's pretty good because those steel pellets will go straight through somebody and out the other side and through somebody else. And if they're bearing a Koran over their heart, it'll go straight through that, too. So they won't be able to say, 'Ah, I was bearing a Koran over my heart and guess what, the missile stopped halfway through.' No way, 'cause it'll go straight through that as well. They'll be dead, in other words.|Hitchens, more sauced than usual|Wishfulness has led them to seriously mischaracterize the origins of [[Israel|the problem]] and to produce an article that is redeemed from complete dullness and mediocrity only by being [[NO U|slightly but unmistakably smelly]].|Hitchens [http://www.slate.com/id/2138741/ on ''The Israel Lobby''], defending Zion and his fellow Neocons with second-grade insults|...the long-feared coincidence of a messianic regime with an apocalyptic weapon will either occur on your own watch or will be conclusively prevented from occurring.|Hitchens advises [[Obama|his new favorite jigaboo]] on the topic of Iran [http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/2009%20-%20Winter/Author%20links/full-HitchensPresWin09.html with magical predictions]|How nice to have a "peace" movement that is either openly on the side of the vermin, or neutral as between them and the cleanup crew, and how delightful to have a press that refers to this partisanship, or this neutrality, as "progressive."|Hitchens on the anti-war movement|The realization that American power could and should be used for the defense of pluralism and as a punishment for fascism came to me in Sarajevo a year or two later... That was an early quarrel between me and many of my Nation colleagues, and it was also the first time I found myself in the same trench as people like Paul Wolfowitz and Jeane Kirkpatrick: a shock I had to learn to get over.|Hitchens on his conversion into an imperialist fuckhead}}</center>
