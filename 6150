Scn Melbourne are still hosting a birthday party for LRH! They moved it out of the city because of, well... you know. <big>March 29th</big>, so get up and let Deakin know that they are Not Okay. Turn up with a copy of the invite and try and get in. Flyers. The deal is well known.<br>

<br><br>
Directional information: The main way of getting to Deakin University, Burwood, is by using the 767 bus that runs between Southland and Box Hill. If you can get to either Southland, Box Hill, Chadstone, etc, you can get that bus, and you will see a big red sign saying DEAKIN. [http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/maps_stations_stops/metropolitan_buses/bus_767 MetlinkMelbourne] (see gray dot towards Box Hill for Deakin) can be used to find nearby stations or whatever. Hughesdale Station or Jordanville Station are recommended to get to, either has the 767 running nearby. To make this simpler you could also use the Journey Planner with either one of these stations/places as the destination, or just place your address and Deakin University's address (above image) into it. Good luck.

SydneyRaid started off rather lethargically, with anons and non-anons alike enjoying a light concert of fantastic songs at Hyde Park for an hour.

When the protest and march started we were met with both curious and supporting ausfags. No dilemmas yet.

Upon arrival at the Sydney Church of Scientology, we noticed that two large trucks were illegally parked in front of the church at a "NO PARKING" zone ([http://partyvan.info/index.php/Image:No_parking_syd.JPG link]), barring it's view ([http://partyvan.info/index.php/Image:Trucks_syd.JPG link]). The church upper floors (of which vision was not blocked by the trucks) appeared completely empty. We notified police and they said; QUOTE "...you cannot remove the trucks when they're parked in a no parking zone" -- WTF?!?! Later the Truck Driver said that it's okay if he stays within 1m of his truck (don't know if what he said is true or not) Apparently, they were trying to deter Anonymous and make it seem as if we were shouting at nothing. This was to no avail as Anon declared epic win by the end of the day.

The trucks did indeed belong to the Co$; or at least are affiliated with them. Two Anons, quite early in the morning when the numbers were still low, noticed a photographer snapping pictures of protesters as they arrived, hoping to catch them without masks. These two anons decided to follow the photographer, to offer him some cake...

The scilon had repeatedly retreated when Anonymous's collective attention began to shift towards him, and when the two /b/rothers pursued him, he broke into an undignified sort of jog-hobble, and started chatting into his mobile. The two Anon strode calmly along behind him, enjoying the fresh air and sunshine Hyde Park has to offer. He finally stopped - greeted a sinister looking bloke in a *red shirt*. A red shirt inscribed with the ''same delivery company seen on the red truck outside the $cifag's Sydney org*''. The $cifags were eventually encouraged, now that there were two of them, to have a chat with the anon in question. They were both devout placentafags; one even suggested that he'd read the Dianatics shit, and that it all, 'seemed like good, common sense stuff' - the anon asked him how space aliens causing mental illness, combined with voltmeters masquerading as high-tech gadgetry was *common sense*, and neither seemed inclined to comment. When asked about Lisa McPherson, they replied, ‘Who?’ and when told the story, changed the subject, pointing out one of the anon’s t-shirt, which had some shit from Counterstrike on it. Anon informed him that while gamers only lob bullets at each other over the internet, $cientology has been responsible for numerous *real* deaths. No respawn points in real life, faggots. The $cifags, having endured sufficient enturbulation, decided they were, 'done talking'. Enturbulation, it seems, occurs when a $cifag hears something that threatens to upset his conditioning. Brave New World style; Cheer up, L. Wrong. You could use some Soma.

Both the cultists were archetypal lonely misfits - and claimed to have found, 'hundreds of friends' within $cientology. The weak, the lonely, the sick, the feeble and gullible; they were victims. An old guy with a camera, probably recruited after losing his wife or something. And perhaps even MOAR tragic; a young man who could otherwise had been at home, enjoying a sunny Saturday, perhaps with *real* friends or family. Instead, both were sweltering in the midday sun, on a noble quest to crush Free Speech with their, ‘OT powers’. What a fucking waste. [[Anonymous|I]] mean, better way to spend a Saturday than being [[rape|used]] by a totalitarian organisation to [[troll|harass]] and monitor protestors guilty only of invoking their right to free speech. And who, may [[Anonymous|I]] add, were actually having *fun* - more than can be said for the poor old Scientologist goons.

Both anon checked his shirt - it was *DEFINITELY* the same delivery company as seen on the red /b/lockading truck. When it was politely requested (lulz) that they desist in photographing the protesters as it made them uncomfortable, the $cifags avoided the question. For those two anon, seeing the bigass removal truck with the same company name on it (and a phone number, sadly 1-300 so it’ll cost a fuckload to rickroll them) later that day was quite amusing; the $cifags certainly fucked up this time. GG.

Later, as the veritable *horde* of masked protesters mobilised to the tune of the 1812 overture and started heading from the park towards the corporation of $cientology’s main Sydney store, one of the same two anon could not help but notice a $cilion trying to hand out magazines titled, 'All in the mind' - probably a vain attempt to troll psychology. Remembering the camera-toting $cifag’s cries of, 'you're only hearing one side of the story', the anon in question offered to take a glossy magazine off the poor cultist's hands - they were thick volumes and the hot, sticky Sydney weather was doubtless causing the poor sod untold torment. Perhaps, if the magazines were removed, the org would let him go home; or so Anonymous mused.

But alas; the Co$ knows no shame. For while knowledge is free, it seems that bullshit is not; the $cifag, when Anonymous requested a copy of his magazine to prove that unlike them, we’re not mindless drones, the $cifag was more than willing to oblige - for a [[lie|very reasonable]] fee of ''$5 a fucking copy''. The anon in question burst out laughing, resisting the temptation to attempt an epic [[card crusher]] manoeuvre with a $5 note. He then gave the $cifag a *free*, informative pamphlet, and moved on after reminding him that knowledge is, indeed, *free*. And the cake was free too.

These are the people we're dealing with - they ask people to seek their truth, then try to charge them for the privilege. We've already won.

Other issues include the scifag who lurked around the protest taking flyers off people and disposing of them or putting them in his pocket. Here is the dood [http://maoro.org/sbhs/Images/march%2015/scifag/ here]. He later walked into the church and [http://maoro.org/sbhs/Images/march%2015/scifag/DSC01513.JPG handed the flyers over to the staff], then disappeared into the church. Also, [http://ac.nomz.net/viewtopic.php?id=264 a wild lady] appeared and started dancing in front of the church. Apparantly she was smoking a joint before that dance.

Anonymous also moved around the city to Town Hall and Pitt Street Mall where they effectively conveyed their message. What is interesting, is that the two large trucks in front of the church (explained above) drove off away from the church when Anonymous moved to Town Hall thinking that Anonymous had left, but came back as soon as Anonymous started marching back to the Church of Scientology from Town Hall. This shows that the CoS had some sort of recon' operation going on. They were also observed using SMS and cell-phone calls.

-----------------
Lots of fun. AussieAnon's report is substantial, I'll add a few things (I was the guy in the white shirt, loud tie, carrying bigass "I'M A S.P." sign). This protest was less about informing the public and more about partying hard and messing with the Scilon's heads, it seemed. Was fun while we were there but perhaps not as effective as Feb 10th. We very nearly called Fail Brigade on the scenester fag walking with his shirt off shouting "bitch" at people who didn't accept flyers, but he calmed down a bit.

The woman who tried to take some guy's mask was misunderstood! Caught up in the moment, I think.

Lots of singing over the megaphone, rickrolls, dragonforce and party hard featured on the boombox. Scilons blacked out their windows and took photos, we waved and made peace signs.

HEAPS of honking action: we even got three or four wedding processions and limos to honk! I wonder how much of the honking was due to the s/i/ster with HONK written across her chest...

Pirate girl with "SO I HEARD YOU LIEK SPACESHIPS" was win, I don't care if nobody else gets it but us.

Thanks to the guy who taped my glasses on the outside of my mask, wearing them on the inside sucked.

AussieAnon - thanks a million for bringing the mask, the flyers, being completely prepared. You rocked our socks today. Sucks about the muzzas wanting your flag.

Apparently a Herald Sun photographer had a bunch of anons walk down an alley for a photograph or two, let's hope that eventuates into media coverage.

Also, I was facefagged at Flinders St. Some guy in an orange Tshirt with a red carrybag lifted my mask when he was walking past, I said "Hi, how're you going?" and he didn't take any photos, just walked away quickly. He looked very serious.

The jets were awesome, jokes about the marcabian fleet coming to help us bomb Scieno buildings abounded.

-----------------

A BIG THANKYOU TO THE ANON THAT SAVED ME FROM THE MUZZA'S! A few muzza's, who albeit short and weak, came over and asked for the aussie flag i was wearing. I could see they weren't asking (they were telling), and despite my attempts at being nice and stuff, i could see it was going to get ripped off of my back. Thankfully another anon came over and distracted them with some scientology talk. THANKYOU SO MUCH. +10 internets and delicious cake for you sir. They did return later (with fucking steel bars!) but we managed to change the subject to scientology and stuff, and eventually they started to understand. But that was about it for us, we stayed for another 30-45 mins then went home.

We headed home and some weirdo followed us down onto the station and into the train (we had removed our masks by then). He seemed pretty wasted though, and was abusing random people so I'd say it was simply some mentally ill freak, and not a scifag op. Although one thing did bother us; as he came into our carriage we hopped off the train, trying to lose him. He didnt hop off after us. But when waiting around at parliament, HE CAME BACK FROM MELBOURNE CENTRAL and started abusing us. We walked off, not wanting to cause trouble as he didnt look stable, and eventually we lost him on the train network.

Five people showed up, and the other four all went out to lunch together, so there probably won't be any updates from them for a while.

I was late, but I took some pictures. It was really dead. There was one smarmy looking guy in a suit peeking out from the Scientology building and just waiting. After about 30 minutes, the cops showed up and told us all that we had to go home.

Once I process the photos I'll put them online (I was only able to take a couple :( )

By the way, a friend of mine in Boston just emailed me. "OMG OMG OMG! I just met one of those Anonymous guys! I got a flier! I'm gonna go to the thing tomorrow at 11am! OMG! Have you ever heard of xenu.net?!?!
