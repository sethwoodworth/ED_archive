Eunuch
A Eunuch is a [[n00b]] who generally listens to way too much soft rock, and winds up missing his genetalia. [[Image:698px-Castration_horse.jpg|thumb|right|Lovely.]]

Eunuchs are pretty much the lowest things in society. For some reason, Chinese Emperors had a Eunuch [[fetish]], which pretty much explains everything. In the end, the Eunuchs had more power than the Emperors, which just goes to show [[castration|cutting]] off people's scrotums is generally a bad idea. Some people think that [[Brian Peppers]] is a Eunuch, but that is simply not true.

Becoming a Eunuch is also a common side effect of joining a fraternity. So make sure to never take your pants off when the bros tell you to, or you could get [[pwned]] like that horse. On the other hand, if you are already in a fraternity, this can be a great way to score [[lulz]] off freshman. Think of it as the ultimate haze.

It turns out that [[Jews]] are NOT Eunuchs, for the most part. This is a little known fact discovered by several [[Nazi]] servants of [[Adolf Hitler]] during [[WWII]], which directly led to his [[suicide]]. You see, it turns out that Hitler's hatred of jews was almost entirely due to the fact that he thought they were eunuchs. Which they aren't.

Some Famous Eunuchs include:
*[[Justin Bieber]]
*Jimmy Carter
*[[Mel Gibson]]
*the entire cast for "[[American Idol]]"
*Neil Armstrong
*[[John Travolta]]
*Colin Powel
*[[Rosie O'Donnell]]
*Howard Dean
*Barry Bonds
*Optimus Prime
