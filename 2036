Danny Phantom
[[Image:Lancer Transvestite.gif|thumb|NOT fanart.]]

'''''Danny Phantom''''' is a completely unoriginal cartoon series created by [[Fag|Butch '''Botch''' Hartman]]. Nickelodeon, in early 2004, decided they needed a copycat cartoon show to compete with ''Kim Possible'', another unoriginal piece of shit cartoon airing on [[Disney|some other network]], in order to rake in teh [[meth]] funds. They even went so far as to hire the same character designer, but soon after the production ran over budget and they had to hire fuckwit [[fanfiction|cookie-cutter writers]] to do the rest of the work.

==The Show==

Every episode is centered around [[Fucktarded|Danny Fenton]], his two parasitic friends [[Goth|Sam Manson]] and black person, his ghost-obsessed parents, and his [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] older sister named [[whore|Jasmine]], frequently referred to as <del>[[semen|"Jizz"]]</del> "Jazz". Danny has to hide his ghost persona for fear of [[fursecution|persecution]], much like teh [[gay]] people residing in closets. It is automatically assumed that Danny and his friends are all closet cases, due to their gay [[transvestite]] teacher. Remember, [[fact|gay teachers mean gay students]]!

Most fans of this show lack the capacity to understand the [[rap|horrible pseudo-hip-hop theme song]] completely. It describes how Danny became a ghost hybrid. The story goes that Danny's [[fat]], square-shaped father, Jack Fenton, was working on a project to compete with [[Goatse]], but in an unexpected turn of events, anyone who came in contact with the [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE|device]] was either so shocked they turned ghostly white and gained superpowers, or they were shot in the gut with a Magnum. They decided to hide it in the family basement, while it was still completely functional. It's [[obvious]] that Danny's parents are either [[fucktarded]] or [[childfree|want their children dead]]. Danny, by nature a white knuckled video-game playing [[basement dweller]], was exposed to Jack Fenton's device, gained ghost powers, and discovered the horrible ghost zone that exists beyond Goatse's colon. Rather than turn the fucking thing off or break it, Danny takes on the responsibility of capturing the ghosts that were now coming out of device in Danny's basement, and BANG. Fifty episodes. The same thing over and over and OVER. It gets really, REALLY bad at times, especially when you realize that the show is a combination of ''Scooby-Doo'' and anime. WHY DON'T THEY JUST [[Kill it with fire|DESTROY THE GHOST PORTAL]]?

The show jumps between lame [[teenager|teen]] [[angst]] that's been done [[at least 100]] times before, and limited animation filler that would only be interesting if you were smoking [[drug|salvia]]. Danny and his minions attend Casper High-school, a [[Zionist]] plot to perpetuate the stereotypical high-school society so another generation of [[fucktards]] are too obsessed over teenage [[drama]] to see that [[truth|'''ZIONISTS ARE TAKING OVER THE WORLD.''']]

The school's name is also a faggoty joke about a cartoon character nobody [[no more than 99|under 95]] remembers.

The show obtained many geeky fangirls after a certain period of time, as most shows are cursed to, although this is mainly groupies and trolls who can't do much better than writing up underage kiddie porno and bitch-slapping each other for no apparent reason.  This is why the show died off so fucking quickly. The groupie community has tried to support ''DP'' by creating crudely-drawn pictures of everyone holding hands, which is easily confused with an image depicting the [[Homosexual|Gay Pride Parade]]. These pictures have stacked up in the hundreds, to which Butch Hartman seems to be either ignoring, or using the print-outs to wipe his [[goatse|fat ass]] with.

==Facts==
*Danny's character is voiced by a [[wanker]] by the name of [[Fucktard|David Kaufman]], who acts out the voice and character of the whiny, horny teenager surprisingly well.

*Butch Hartman originally wanted the show to be moar liek ''[[80s|Ghostbusters]]'' but decided to make it more [[Gay|original]], thus the idea of the ghost teen was born.

*His fans blame gays for the show getting cancelled. For MOAR info, see WhiteGryphon and [[Kitty006]].
==BIG FUCKING CHAIN OF SHITTY FANART==
On [[DeviantART]] there happens to be a [http://search.deviantart.com/searchcraft/?section=browse&qh=boost%3Apopular+age_sigma%3A24h+age_scale%3A5&q=danny+phantom+chain+sort%3Atime&offset=240 stupid fad] in which shitty ''Danny Phantom'' OCS and other self-inserts are holding each other's hands, forming a chain of [[at least 100]] shittyn drawings screaming "SAVE DANNY!".  Of course, neither Nickelodeon or Butch will listen.
