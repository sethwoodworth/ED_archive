'''Allan Greenwald''' or '''[[Lupine]] [[in the ass|Ass]]assin''' (AKA: ''Wolf God Of Sex'', ''Dr. Enthusiasm'', ''Scorpio Wolf'', and ''Wonderboy''), is a middle-age [[jewish]] [[zoophile]], [[furfag]], and [[basement dweller]] with [[no life]] whatsoever. On March 1, 2009, he was [[banned]] from [[furry]] after he became [[homeless]] but still hasn't given up jewing like crazy for art.

He had previously gained notoriety in the "[[Furry|Fandom]]" for commissioning an endless amount of pictures, then turning around and [http://forums.furaffinity.net/showthread.php?t=33292 begging for money AGAIN]. Now he's famous for being the obnoxious permabanned furfag who [[Dragoneer]] loves to hate.

==The Life-time Achievements of Allan==
[[File:Dragoneer killed.jpg|thumb|Long-standing love affair with [[Dragoneer]].]]

{{squote|Okay, people. Confession time. I've been debating for a long spell if I should explain how I became obsessed with all things furry. So here goes:

I can't remember what month it was, but I'm certain it was definitely a Wednesday afternoon and I was 4. I was glued to Sesame Street like all other kids back in the day.

Anyhow, I watched it, seeing one of those in-between segments that had a nice music bed underneath. This segment had your average middle-class kitchen: linoleum floors, a counter top where the sink is, wooden cabinets with a stove, and a bowl of water for the dog. The dog proceeds to walk over and drink from the bowl. Okay, fair enough, but then they zoom in on the dog's face....

As the dog drinks from his bowl, they focused on his mouth and tongue, showing it in extreme slow-motion. I'm watching this and had a sexual epiphany (remember I was only 4 at the time). After the scene ended, I ran to the kitchen stark naked and shouted full-volume to my mom, "I'm the only one in the world that can do THIS!!", showing her the biggest fucking boner.

Call me crazy, but that's what happened, and I'm not ashamed about it. I'm a furry for life, and I'm all the better for it.}}

[[Image:Allan-in-Army.jpg|thumb|He's no [[Metal Gear Solid|Big Boss]]...]]
[[Image:Allan at nine lol.jpg|thumb|Destined for [[fail|greatness?]]]]

The [[Furry]] "[[Fandom]]" was his entire life.  Literally...

He is now a 37 year-old cast away who is all alone in the middle of [[New York City]] with no friends, no family, no [[job]], no home, no skills, no [[money]], no [[internet]] - with nothing but <s>his laptop</s>, 2 [[dollars]], 7 suitcases of shit and 415 ''completely'' worthless "artworks" (All depicting his "[[Fursona]]"). He has the [[Shame|honor]] of being a massive [[lolcow]] and being laughed at even by the other [[furries]] ([[Loser]]s, although not on the same level as Allan). But these two achievements are unlikely to help him survive in the streets. 

Commissions were paid by Allan with the [[money]] he earned by begging the other [[furfags]] over the [[Internets]] while living with his [[Your Mom|mother]]; Allan never held a [[job]] in his life. Once his "bills" were paid by [[gullible]] [[furfags]] who throw [[money]] at his [[Paypal]] address, he would delete his beggar journals and repost the commissions. According to [http://forums.furaffinity.net/showpost.php?p=890552&postcount=22 one count], this has cost his almost equally [[retard]]ed benefactors anywhere between $2,000 to $16,000.

Allan now sucks off the [[US]] [[Government]] [http://www.megaupload.com/?d=Y9KILVMX by his own admission], yet still manages to rack up commissions from expensive artists. 

{{quote|My thing? Had to get my food stamp card renewed today. With much waiting there, I got it done. Before I stopped there today, I got word my Army $ should be made available some time this week. That, and my upcoming tax refund $. Still need to receive the packet from Fort Benning, so I can then hire a local VA Rep to wrangle power-of-attorney from Georgia, representing my veterans' benefits and such. Also expecting to receive unemployment and social security money soon as well.}}

==Banned from RL and the Internets==
[[Image:Allan.gif|thumb|[[NO U|"BLOCKED"]]]]
[[Image:Allan_freezing_out_here.jpg|thumb|[[Hate art]]]]

The last known words written by Allan before he was banned from [[FurAffinity]] (where since April 2006, he had 1,377 submissions, gave 17,644 comments, and accumulated a whooping 68,947 favorites) were: 

{{quote|I AM FREEZING OUT HERE! <br> SOMEONE, ANYONE PLEASE SEND HELP!! <br> HELP ME PLEASE!!!!!!!!}}

This was followed by "GO FUCK YOURSELF" in the answer to the advice he should head for the homeless shelter, after which he was [[B&]]. Allan's current status since then is unknown (He may be dead or alive. Nobody knows or cares). Unfortunately, the [[epic]] journal post was deleted after it received over 1,000 [[lulzy]] comments in 2 days.

A complete PDF copy of his journal (with 1248 comments) is available [http://www.megaupload.com/?d=RVUO4ZAX here].

Folks, he ain't coming back to [[FurAffinity]] either. As predicted, he 'couldn't change his ways' as he so stated in his [[DA]] journals, and will not be coming back to FA (Despite the PERMAban he has). So like a cumstain on a white bedsheet, Allan's ban is there to stay unless [[Dragoneer]] suddenly develops a bad case of amnesia. 

Due to Allan creating the distraughtsuffering account, in a stunning turn of events, [[Dragoneer]], around April Fools' Day, used his mighty [[Banhammer]] and swung it one last time, this time at Allan's page, changing the ADMINISTRATOR NOTICE to read "User has been perma-banned from Fur Affinity", to the much chagrin of all of the Allan haters.

[[Image:Lolcaught.jpg|thumb|[[Dragoneer]] says NO to Allan's second (or third) coming.]]

Still, not having learned the first two times, using proxies, Allan creates another account "[http://www.furaffinity.net/user/8543430 8543430]", [[Dragoneer]] calls him on it, leaves him a nice shout, then uses his [[Banhammer]] again and [[bans]] Allan for the third time.

It has been rumored that Allan has created a fourth account, but it hasn't been found... YET.

==Dragoneer just says NO to Allan ==
With all the cocksucking going on between the two, you would wish these two would just get over it and fuck already. However, it looks like more cocksucking is in the forecast as neither of the two fucktards wants to back down. 

[[Image:Furry_Numbers.jpg|thumb|Even counting with the lowest estimations, That makes a lot! #1 being [[Dragoneer|the Boss]] of Furaffinity, it's logic he banned that hobo.]] 
Allan tried to appease Dragoneer by claiming he wanted to pay everyone back. With what [[money]] we don't know...

{{squote|I wish to contact everyone who lent me money and get their PayPal addresses, so I can start paying them back.

Additionally, I'm asking to provide a character witness to [[Dragoneer]], that I want back on FA and that I'm taking the necessary steps to redeem myself and right all my wrongs.

I'm HOPING when [[Dragoneer]] sees I'm willing to right past wrongs and settle old debts with people personally, he'll reconsider my FA ban.

Please spread the word about this. Ask furs to re-post this journal on other fursites (including FA) so that more people know how serious I wish to make things right. Thanks.}}
...Of course, he doesn't mean any of this. He just wants to be unbanned from [[FurAffinity]] by the big meanie [[Dragoneer]] so he can commission MORE artists for his vore-porn.

When this didn't work, he returned to [[FurAffinity]] under the with the suckpuppet "[http://www.furaffinity.net/user/distraughtsuffering distraughtsuffering]", and posted this journal:


<div style="height:200px; overflow:scroll;">
I am speaking on behalf of a certain sexy black wolf DJ with the red bandanna....me.

First off, I wish to apologize profoundly for all the drama I caused. I meant no harm to anyone, and I hope everyone can forgive me. I wish to set things right.

I've been living in a homeless shelter for 3 weeks now. It's hell on earth, and I gotta be alert every passing second. I'm still hurt that my laptop was stolen last week. Police are investigating it as a grand larceny case. All my files and personal information are in that laptop. I had to freeze all my accounts for fear of someone accessing them.

I have pleaded with [[Dragoneer]] and several other admins to let my voice be heard without prejudice or drama, because there are many furs out there who wish to know the latest about me. The ban was a raw deal, I'm thoroughly convinced. I bear no ill will to anyone here, and I wish to keep this vital line of communication open for various reasons.

As of now, I promise you I will not ask for any more handouts or donations. If need be, I will gladly refund any donation that was given to me as soon as I earn some money. I am still looking for work and a place to call home....nothing yet.

This is a plea from my very core. I hope I'm not damned for posting this journal. I only wish to keep you guys informed in the meantime.

And in about 20 minutes, I need to log off this library pc, and go back to another slow and miserable day.

God bless FA and all the members. You are all my family. I love you.
</div>
He was quickly rebanned and the journal was deleted (but not before he received much <s>love</s> hate).

When this, too, failed, Allan had a chat with [[Dragoneer]], begging and pleading like the pathetic piece of crap he is to be let back on FA and oddly, posted the unedited content of his little chats on his [[DA]] account in now deleted journals. This was confirmed by [http://twitter.com/Dragoneer/status/6990686907 Dragoneer]. The best bits are below with the entire journal available [http://www.megaupload.com/?d=T0WO90EM here].

<div style="height:300px; overflow:scroll;">
[16:18] Dragoneer: Per the FA Terms of Service, "FA is not a
backup service and is not responsible for long term archiving of
user files."

[16:18] Dragoneer: So there you go.

[16:19] Lupine Assassin: who else had their files removed?

[16:19] Dragoneer: Do I have to spell out the FA privacy policy to
you, too?

[16:19] Lupine Assassin: don't be a fucking smartass.

[16:20] Lupine Assassin: is there ANY chance of me rejoining fa?

[16:20] Dragoneer: Lupine Assassin, sexy wolf (4:13 PM): UGH! do
i have to spell it out for you? <---- See, here ,where you said "Do I
have to spell it out for you" in all lower case?

[16:21] Dragoneer: It was a witty retort, not smartassery. Being a
smart ass, my response would have been "y-e-s".

[16:21] Lupine Assassin: besides which, you NEVER gave me the
chance to post my journal in my defense.

[16:22] Lupine Assassin: no one got to hear my side of the story.
you need to let me back on so people can hear both sides

[16:25] Dragoneer: Well, I have to head out now. Work's over.

[16:25] Lupine Assassin: you didn't answer me

[16:26] Dragoneer: I don't need to let you back on FA, no.

[16:26] Dragoneer: If you want to be back on FA you'll have to do
more than point a finger at me and go "You're a doodoohead!"
while accusing me of playing some petty popularity game.

[16:26] Lupine Assassin: and your bad rep precedes you

[16:27] Dragoneer: No, it doesn't. I'm a Digimon. One of my innate
powers is Aura of Asshattery.

[16:27] Dragoneer: Besides, you have to be stern in my position.
It's not always fun.

[16:28] Lupine Assassin: you think what you did to me is fun?

[16:29] Dragoneer: Honestly? No. I find some of your accusations
hilarious, but "fun" is not amongst it. Masturbating is fun. Playing
[[Team Fortress 2]] is fun. Eating ice cream and hanging out with
friends? Fun.

[16:29] Lupine Assassin: fuck you and i hope you fucking die you
worthless fag nigger

====Vengeance is Futile====
[[Last Thursday]], Allan saw some images of his character posted on FA that bordered on hate art, even though such images are against FurAffinity's [http://wiki.furaffinity.net/AUP#Harassment Acceptable Use Policy] and the creators would meet [[Dragoneer]]'s [[banhammer]] if anyone else (especially himself) was featured in them. Since somehow FurAffinity's [[lie|unbiased]] and completely [[Corrupt|fair]] administrators had failed to remove such blatant violations of site rules, Allan decided to [[retard|abuse copyright laws]] and sent Dragoneer a [[DMCA]] notice [[Fail|claiming copyright on the images]]. Dragoneer responded with a [[LOL WUT]] and ignored it. This led Allan to send the notice to FurAffinity's ISP. Said ISP threatened to [[ban]] FurAffinity from the [[Tubes|intertubes]] unless '''ALL''' images of Allan were removed from the site. Dragoneer told the ISP the notice was [[bullshit]], but [[Delete fucking everything|he complied anyway]] - and, in an extra step, he also removed images that even resembled Allan's character ''even if they weren't of his character'', either him just being a [[douchebag]] as usual or he has sunk to new lows of [[stupids]].

Many furries accused Dragoneer of overreacting, even though anyone who is familiar with him has to wonder why removing Allan's [[fursona|pride and joy]] wasn't part of his [[permaban]] (unless he had [[masturbation|some sort of reason]] to keep all his commissioned art up...) Others thought Furraffinity should call in their [[E-lawyers]] and [[Lolsuit|countersue]] Allan for abusing the DMCA (like Allan has any money anyways). Allan scrambled to try and undo the damage his DMCA caused by promising people he wasn't planning any sort of [[Lolsuit|lawsuit]] against any artist.  But the [[furries]], angry over the loss of potential fap material (and their own artwork), refused to listen to his pleas and banished him to [[Real life|furry hell]] once more.

This guy must have the worst luck in the world or needs sympathy to survive.

{{squote|My [shelter] room was broken into last night. After waiting 6 hours to reserve it, some asshole broke in and went through my clothing bag and stole something mom gave me.}}

He must be wearing a sign that says "I AM ALLAN - STEAL STUFF FROM ME" on his back or something.
===Army of FAIL===
Allan now has a [[job]] with the [[US]] [[Army]]! He quickly moved out of the hellhole known as the shelter and is now at an undisclosed location.

'''PRIVATE ALLAN, TEN-HUT!'''

(UPDATE 05/14/09)

According to his MySpace:

"Yep!! I will be shipping out to Ft. Benning, Georgia in a few days for Basic & Infantry Training. I'm very nervous over the whole thing, but I feel everything will be alright from here on in. WISH ME LUCK!!"

(UPDATE 01/07/10)

Unsurprisingly...

Lupine Assassin says:
 i was in the army
 got medical discharge
Lupine Assassin says:
 got hurt in basic training so they let me go

===Can't even get theft right===
[[Image:1268195042.superstinkwarrior_lupine_assassination.jpg|thumb|Allan is reeeaccching for your wallet!]]
From the military to [http://pastebin.ca/1823901 shlepping copies of pirated music via Linkbucks for money].  This is the natural order of things.

==Allan: The Fail Continues==
[[Image:AllanFail.jpg|thumb|Allan today]]
Believe it or not even to this day he still somehow gets commissions from people on Furaffinty using everyone else's money.

Allright everybody, you've seen the [[fag]] under the [[furfag|fur]], now its time to [[kill it with fire|do something]] about it. [[At least 100]] different [[sheep|furries]] have come forward and massed all of their [[dox]] into one massive [[chris hansen|report to the FBI]].

[http://silversyourstep.blogspot.com/2010/06/no-more-allan.html This blog] has detailed descriptions of how exactly to tell the [[party van|fbi]] to pay Allan a visit. With [[anon]] backed up by mass [[furfaggotry]], Allan will soon see the full force of the [[internet hate machine|american judicial system]].

Spread and use these links on Allan for [[epic|great]] [[win|justice]]!

===Ban From e621!===
Allan had been spotted on [[e621.net]] posting his commissions. If anyone tried to talk to him about anything other than his art, he would complain that they were [[trolling]]. Same old [[BS]]. He would report them to the mods and try to get them [[banned]] if they said anything negative about him or the art he purchased and posts freely.

[[File:e621ban.png|300px|500px]]

[http://e621.net/post?tags=lupine_assassin&searchDefault=Search Just searching Lupine Assassin brings up a whole host of repulsive yiffy art.]

It wasn't long before the same song and dance [http://e621.net/user_record?user_id=11614 got him banned from this website].

[[File:LA_Fucks_Up_Again.png|600px|600px]]

Although he is [[banned]], his artwork is still up.  Please take less than 5 minutes of your time to vote down all of his uploads. On the upper left, change the "Mode" dropdown to "Vote Down" and then just click once on everything, then go to the next page and repeat! Send this asshat a clear message.

===Inkbunny===

He is also currently on Inkbunny, posting his commissions

http://inkbunny.net/lupineassassin

He also posted a journal about attending Anthrocon, there. Presumably he's paying for his hotel and tickets with money that isn't his.
