A survivalist is created when a [[pyro]] and/or [[anarchist]] grows up, but doesn't mature out of their anti-authority "FUCKTEHPIGS" mentality.  This changes to "Fuck the GOVERNMENT", so basically survivalism is an upgrade on stupid.  Most survivalists can be found in the [[redneck|southern states]] however, this does not necessarily mean they don't have [[internets]] access.  Survivalism is passed from generation from generation by the teachings of the [[Waco|Waco Siege]], and cries about how the government were such [[C-NOTE|AWP whores]].  Survivalists are also known to be [[internet tough guy]]s, conspiracy theorists, [[batshit insane]], and own a library of [[Paladin-Press]] books.

==  The Idea  ==

One of the fundamental beliefs of survivalism is that the world is gonna end (due to [[CIA]], [[Furluminati]], [[Partyvan]], [[Jews]], [[Miltopia]], etc.) so we have to stock up on plastic sheets, duct tape, lotsa guns, and [[furshampoo]].  Their wet dream fantasy is the breakdown of society, so they can get [[e-penis|bragging rights]] to who was "more prepared" and to give them an excuse to shoot would-be [[blacks|looters]].  One of their biggest voices for the survivalist movement is Kurt Saxon; such a good role model who just so happened to blow most of his hand off making an explosive device.


=== [[Y2K]] ===

Interest in survivalism started to spike with the new millennium fast approaching.  Every dumbass and their dog bought into the hype; bought massive amounts of [[spam|canned food]] and [[gun]]s.  Of course [[noone]] knew that absolutely dick all happened, leaving survivalists to be the laughing stock of the year.  The [[butthurt]] ones that wouldn't give up tried again with "the world ends in 2001, the REAL millennium", which of course [[nothing]] happened again.... except for [[JEWS DID WTC|WTC]].
