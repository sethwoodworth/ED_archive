Limapal00za
__NOTOC__
'''Limapal00za''' is one of the more [[pretentious]] female [[vlogger]]s on [[YouTube]] and [[Vloggerheads]] whom often enjoys deluding herself via feigning [[moralfag|moral superiority]] and/or heavy handed and meaningless [[USI|didactics]].  She is [[notable]] only for posting the "i despise the word called [[lulz]]" video making her the most prolific form of [[Miltopia|anti-lulz]] in existence.  A [[TL;DW]] eight minute and twenty-six second rant video incorporating everything that is awesome about the internet. Including:

*Calling out users for [[irony|creating fake drama for views]].
*Making statements about being "above" it. 
*Namedropping random internet sluts.  
*Referencing obscure [[flamewar]]s that no one knows anything about.
*Sad Pearl Jam songs playing in the background.

And yes, she has been invited to [[lulzcon]].

[[srsly|Predictably]], she would later remove the video. [[You]] can help [[ED]] by tossing up a mirror.

==Trivia==

*[[Tom Searson]] claims he fucked lima to piss off the beeobee while she was deployed over in the mideast.
*Most people didn't enjoy putting up with her in [[Stickam]] in the first place, largely for the reasons mentioned above.
