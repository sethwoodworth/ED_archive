[[Image:Bigrigsgameplay.jpg|thumb|right|Stunning graphics]]

Like the superb writings of [[Peter Chimaera]] or the stunning art of [[Tori Sue Heck]], '''''Big Rigs''''' is considered to be [[crap|the top of its league]] and, by far, the most epic game evar since ''[[Halo|Halo 3]]'' and ''[[Bioshock]]'', with [[fail|amazing]] graphics and [[gay|superb]] gameplay and [[OVER 9000|over 4]] different levels to choose from, making it almost as great as ''[[No|Battletoads]]''. [[9000|10,000+]] [[WINNER|WINNERs]] bought [[Truck|Big Rigs]]. YOU'RE WINNER !ï»¿

== Gameplay/Storyline ==
''Big Rigs'' features a variety of trucks to choose from, like the standard [[cock|Big Rig]] to, well, the standard Big Rig. As far as the game goes, its like [[Grand Theft Auto|GTA]] meets ''[[Banjo Kazooie]]'' meets [[Pedobear]] in an Arcade-style fighting adventure. Much like any amazing game, its controls are [[retard|flawless]] and smooth, with [[lie|well-designed levels to add]].

It takes place in [[China]] during the [[Russia|Cold War]], with the main character being an [[Gears of War|Ex-con who killed his own teammates]]. Your goal is to take down the Chinese government using [[buttsecks|special tactics]] with your [[cock|Big Rigs]] at hand, defeating the evil emperor [[Jack Thompson|Ho-Chi Minh]], and saving the world, all in one hour.

==YOU'RE WINNER !==
''Big Rigs'' also spawned a [[mini meme]] that plenty of [[b|/b/-tards]] use, over the fact that when you win a game it says in [[ALL CAPS]] "[[A winner is you|YOU'RE WINNER]]". Although it was [[lie|the only flaw]] in the game, many [[douchebag|douchebags]] used it whenever they thought they won, which in [[reality]], they failed. Badly.

== History ==
After being created with the help of [[Epic Fail Guy|Sergey Titov]], ''Big Rigs'' became a huge (s)hit with gamers and [[tourneyfag|reviewers]] alike. Don't believe me? Well, the proof's in the [[cum|pudding]]:

The highest score given to this game by any reviewer is 1/10, which was only as high because their system did not have a 0/10 option. In fact netjak had its code re-written to allow a score of zero just for this game alone.
