Free Realms

'''''Free Realms''''' is a [[MMORPG]] for [[children]] on the [[PC]] and eventually the [[PS3|PS Triple]]. It was created when [[John Smedley]] took a fuckton of [[LSD]] after playing loads of [[WoW]], [[EQ2]], [[Mario|Mario Kart]], [[Animal Crossing]], and [[Kitchen|Cooking Mama]]. The story consists simply of: "be a hipster that beats the shit out of seagulls and drives cars into things." Notably, this game looks like [[Nintendo]] made it, but no, [[SOE]] did.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Free_realms_clyde.jpg|thumb|right|HNGGG STRANGLE THAT [[Clyde Cash|CLYDE CASH]]]]
The gameplay of Free Realms is [[Wii|ultra-casual]] and obviously targeted at [[12 year old girls]]. Everything is colorful and almost patronizing (for example, if you do not quickly find three blocks to match in the ''Bejeweled''-style games, ''it does it for you''.) The game also downloads things over time, like ''[[Guild Wars]]'' does, and is almost completely instanced (meaning you fight monsters and do other fun, useful activities away from people in the overworld area.)

The instances are also minigames. Be it fighting [[frog]]s, racing [[Mario Kart|karts]] and crashing them, harvesting weird [[fags|fruits]] to cook with, you can choose to be [[alone]] in a world of sugar-hyped kiddies.

SOE also encourages [[facebook|socializing]], which usually means talking about ''Webkinz''.

==Races==
There are currently only two playable races (something ''Free Realms'' does not share with EQ2.): humans, which are [[metrosexual]]-looking preteens, and [[weeaboo|pixies]], [[fairies]] with huge [[Animu|bobble-heads]].

==Jobs==

Free Realms has a system where you can change your job at any time. It's kind of similar to ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', except the jobs are completely out of place. You'd expect combat classes like an [[MMORPG]], and to an extent, crafters, but out of fucking nowhere, you can pick a class that can [[Awesome|smash cars into other cars]]. These are all playable up until level 5 and Jew.

*'''[[Hippy|Archer]]''' - Shoots arrows.

*'''[[Hipster|Adventurer]]''' - This class is the default class. It only levels up by collecting floating tokens, bubbles, flowers, and other household items. It can also dress up like a [[metrosexual]].

*'''[[Black]]smith''' - Make weapons for people! [[No|Hurray!]]

*'''[[Internet tough guy|Brawler]]''' - The typical fighter class. They wield huge [[Banhammer|hammers]] and throw rocks at shit. When playing this class, you [[Super Smash Bros.|button-mash]] as much as possible.

*'''[[Yugioh|Card Duelist]]''' - Play card games with virtual cards  or cards bought [[IRL]] ingame. The whole thing has been done already in [[EQ2]].

*'''[[Kitchen|Chef]]''' - Plays like a combination of ''Bejeweled'' and ''Cooking Mama''. By going back to the [[kitchen]], you can make all sorts of food using [[pot|what appear to be common herbs]].

*'''[[Derby|Demo Derby Driver]]''' - By using controls that are shakier than [[Michael J. Fox]]'s handwriting, you can run cars into each other and watch them fukken explode.

*'''[[Old|Fisherman]]''' - Same thing as ''[[Animal Crossing]]''.

*'''[[Redneck|Go Kart Driver]]''' - ''Mario Kart'' with the same controls as the demolition derby class.

*'''[[Team Fortress 2|Medic]]''' - You can either heal people or hack the shit out of things with a bonesaw. [[TF2|Sound familiar]]?

*'''[[Jew Gold|Miner]]''' - Basically the chef class except everything's replaced with rocks.

*'''[[Ninja]]''' - This class is supposed to be based on stealth. From that it can be deduced that most Free Realms characters are completely colorblind to the colors represented in the [[naruto|pastel clothing]] of the ninjas.

*'''[[World Cup|Soccer Star]]''' - A semi free-to-play class. Play soccer to annoying-as-fuck music!

*'''[[NeoPets|Pet Trainer]]''' - While this class is free to play as, the pets that are trained aren't. [[Dogs]] and [[cats]] with their own personalities cost two USD. The gameplay is just like ''[[Nintendo DS|Nintendogs]]'', further adding to the idea that this game is a giant "[[NO U]]" from [[Sony]] to [[Nintendo]].

*'''[[Speed|Postman]]''' - Level up by running away from dogs and chucking [[spam]] into people's [[Email|inboxes]]!

*'''[[Viking|Warrior]]''' - Viking helms, axes, and [[BDSM|leather outfits]].

*'''[[Harry Potter|Wizard]]''' - The [[typical]] magic-using class. Users with this class dress like a cross between [[WoW]] and ''[[Harry Potter]]'' characters.

==It's Over One Million!==
Hate to pull out [[Over 9000|that old meme]], but ''Free Realms'' got over one million players within a month. [http://www.massively.com/2009/05/15/free-realms-destroys-the-1-million-account-speed-record/ In fact, this was actually record-breaking.] This news alone caused [[Butthurt|pains in the rear-ends]] of people [[Darkfall|who ''insist'' MMORPGs should be "hardcore"]] and WoW players. SOE came and made [[party hard|parties]] on May 15, 2009.

To give you an idea of how [[fag]]gy these parties were, we have provided some pictures below.

===Holy Balls! TWO Million?!===
[[Image:Chatdy_gtfo.png|thumb|right|[[GTFO|It's not always your world.]]]]
[http://www.massively.com/2009/05/28/over-2-million-now-served-in-free-realms/ Two weeks after the May 15 parties, FR hit two million players.] WoWfags sat in a corner to raid Ulduar for the [[At least 100|100th time]] and to listen to [[Linkin Park]], unaware that [[Duh|FR and WoW are two totally different types of MMOs]]. Right after FR hit two million, [http://www.massively.com/2009/05/29/soe-is-jacking-out-of-the-matrix-online/ SOE marked ''The Matrix Online'' to be shut down in late July of 2009] - [[Shit_nobody_cares_about| but who cares?]]

{{squote|I'm not sure how Smedly thinks that Free Realms "resonates with MMO gamers" There is nothing here to hold a mature gamer's attention for more than an hour or two total.|Lethality, Massively user and obvious fucking WoWfag who takes MMORPGs srsly;}}

===THREE Million?===
[http://www.joystiq.com/2009/06/13/free-realms-hits-3-million-players-ps3-version-still-in-develo/ On June 12, the game reached three million players.] [[Smed]] must be flexing his [[trollface]] at the userbases of MMORPG.com by now. It continues to grow.

==The Dares==
[[Image:Unicorn_pee_rainbows.PNG|thumb|right|Grade-A user fap material]]
The theme song "It's Your World" was done by The Dares, a [[California]]-based pop-rock band. They probably smoke a fuckton of [[pot]], as [[you|one]] could assume by watching the video just below this text. [http://www.myspace.com/thedares You can listen to the theme song here, but you'll probably gouge your eardrums out twenty seconds into the song.]

===E3 Concert===
On June 2, The Dares held a concert at E3 while it was broadcasted ingame in ''Free Realms''. This [[What|somehow]] got them an [[Buttsecks|award]] for being the first ever to perform a live and ingame event at the same [[Time paradox|time]]. Snowhill (a place in the game where the concert was held) was swamped with ''[[Twilight]]'' fans, kids complaining that they weren't the [[Jonas Brothers]], people [[spam]]ming "&%^&%^%^&^%^&&^%^&%&^^&^^ LOLLLLLLLLLLL", and faggots from E3 itself.

Since children are playing this game, [[SOE]] has rights to [[Troll|look into your system as you play it]]. This makes trolling in the game hard, but not impossible. This complete [[bullshit]] though due to that fact that [[WoW|most games have children playing on them]].
