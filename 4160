J-Pop

'''J-Poop''' is shit music from [[Japan]] characterized by dance beats, synthesizers and impossibly upbeat vocals sung by [[16 year old girls]] or [[fag]]s. Lyrics are usually about [[animu]] and [[tentacle rape]] with nationalist propaganda almost always present subliminally. J-Pop is easily recognized by its rabid overuse of ganked electronic samples from [[American]] and [[British]] [[pop]] music of the [[1980s]], although the level of production employed by most J-Pop "artists" makes their western counterparts seem like a lone, one-armed hillbilly with a banjo with three broken strings. In the case of Morning Musume, the hillbilly is quadriplegic and plays with his tongue.  Arguments about production values aside, it sounds like a billion splinters of digital cockroach shell spraying into your ears that never ever relents.

In [[Japan]], J-Pop is listened to only by brainless 10 to 14 year-old [[loli]] rapebait and their [[otaku]] stalkers. However, J-Pop is practically a religion to western [[Japanophile]]s who tend to idolize specific J-Pop singers such as Ayumi Hamasaki. J-Pop is often present in [[anime]] such as ''[[Naruto]]'', as it is the only kind of music capable of adequately expressing these shows' level of [[gay]] other than [[Linkin Park|nu-metal]], which is where [[AMV]]s come in.

Although the exact origins of the genre are disputed, [[Nazi|Leni Riefenstahl]] is often named as one of the earliest J-Pop choreographers:

Chronic listening to J-Pop is known to cause a neurological disorder that results in compulsive typing of "[[^_^]]" If someone you know exhibits this symptom, immediately chain them up in your basement or cellar and force them to listen to the Swans' 1983 classic ''Filth'' until the condition subsides. They'll thank you later.

==J-Pop On YouTube==
In case you're wondering what it feels like to have your ears molested by rainbows, [[YouTube]] has some [[lie|great]] J-Pop videos for your listening pain, errrr, pleasure.

If this shit was released in western countries everyone would rightly say it was the stupidest piece of retarded gay fucking bullshit ever, but these 14 year old [[virgins]] think it's great because it's Japanese.
