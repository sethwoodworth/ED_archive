Loler
[[image: Laughing.jpg|thumb|The common loler [[faggot]].]]
A Loler or Lol'er (see also: [[lulz]]) is an individual who has no [[internets]] communication clue what-so-ever.  Commonly you can recognize these people while on popular chat programs like [[AIM]], [[MSN]], [[etc]].  A conversation with these people is a complete waste of time and probably looks something like this:

==Examples of lolers==
You: Hey what's goin on?<br>
Them: LOL nothing!<br>
You: I got into a car wreck today.<br>
Them: LOL no way!<br>

As you can see most replies are followed up with a "[[lol]]", thus making them "lolers".  Also known as "complete [[fucktard]]s", these people are completely useless and unless they have [[OCD|ocd]] or a nitrous supply/leak nearby, are most definitely not laughing out loud all the time.
