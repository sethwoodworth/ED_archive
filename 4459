'''Jéské Couriano''' ([[Powerword|Jeremy Harmon-Kiehl]]) is a [[Wikipedia]] administrator, opponent of [[Grawp]], and child rapist. While it's true that he abuses children, this should not be used as an ad hominem attack against his abilities to properly administrate Wikipedia. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)&diff=prev&oldid=232227319| Couriano also has Autism, which means he's a fucking retard who cries himself to sleep because he has no friends and he was born on the wrong planet] His mom probably did drugs when she was pregnant, which is why his brain came out broken. Jeske also gets very sad when you talk about his family :( :( :( :( because his dad didn't love him and his mother loved him even less. He recently blocked a user for talking about his "family" :( Jéské has also admitted that he is a [[gay]] [[furry]]. In effect, this makes him a gay furry aspie. Sadly, this is a common ailment on Wikipedia.

As with others like [[Ryulong]] and [[Sceptre]], he also despises [[chan]] imageboards due to them being a [[source]] of [[vandalism]], and for various other reasons. He hates them so much that he has written several essays about their lack of morality, such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_%28241-260%29/Mudkipz_FAQ a FAQ as to why the Mudkip meme cannot be added to Wikipedia], and has a personal hatred of Mudkip unrivalled anywhere on the [[internets]].

As with Grawp, Jeske is a [[Dungeons and Dragons]] expert. However, his views on [[notability]] differ from Grawp's, but since all the D&D fanbois on TOW agree with Jeske, they all come under attack from Grawp's wrath, which means that they have suffered [[harassment]] at the hands of Grawp, and his army of [[cockpuppet]]s.

His essay about what he calls "revision-edit vandalism" makes him out to be an [[internet tough guy]] warning against Grawp's [[personal army]], and blocks the IP addresses for 3 months after even just making a single edit that they don't fully understand the consequences of, like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade the Charge of the Light Brigade] being commanded by Grawp to [[die]] in battle without having any other choice about it.

Userboxes on his page say things like “[[LOL WUT|This user converts Kiddy Stuff to work with Dungeons & Dragons]]” and “[[BAW|This user is tired]] of hearing about "lieking [[Mudkip]]z.”<nowiki>[sic]</nowiki>. Also, “Despite the look of this user's [[cock|handle]], he is not of [[Spanish]] or [[Mexican]] heritage”... so why [[cultural appropriation|choose it as your name then]]?

Yup, he really hates Anonymous and really loves to hate Grawp, in conclusion. He cooperates with [[NawlinWiki]], [[Persian Poet Gal]], [[Acalamari]], [[Rodhullandemu]] and a few others... it's always the same names, and they're all working against Grawp, to only a [[epic fail|moderate degree of success]], [[lawl]]. Jéské has even stooped so low as to delete revisions from articles just because they contain the word “HAGGER?” in them.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&page=Durian ]

{{quote|The heart can cut both ways - the vindictive and cruel are [[TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL|condemned to purgatory]]. This is true both of the [[NORP|general population]] and [[Anonymous]].|Jéské Couriano}}

Jéské Couriano also takes Wikipedia policy into his own hands. Since he cannot [[assume good faith]], he has two user [[talk page]]s - one for "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:J%C3%A9sk%C3%A9_Couriano/Discussions legitimate discourse]", and his main talk page as a "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:J%C3%A9sk%C3%A9_Couriano honeypot]", because he actively insults vandals and assumes bad faith in a manner not permitted several Wikipedia policies. However, he hasn't been desysopped yet becuase the [[Bureaucratic Fuck]]s think he's a good vandal fighter, but he even [[fail]]s at that, and gets extremely [[butthurt]] about Wikipedia vandalism.

==Hatred of [[Mudkip]]==
{{quote|Depends. Can you get your men off the [[Pokémon]] [[article]]s before I feel compelled to [[DDOS|DDoS]] 4chan?|Jéské.}}

As we already established, Jéské ''really'', ''really'' does not like mudkip. Despite being a [[Wikipedia admin]], he is a total [[fake editor]] and is even worse than [[NawlinWiki]] in that he doesn't really contribute much to Wikipedia at all. Around half of his edits are on either [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_%28241-260%29 this page] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:4chan this page]. Jéské also thinks that Wikipedia is a [[video game]] and tries to be an [[internet tough guy]] all of the time, but he succeeds only in getting really, really angry and [[butthurt]] all of the time whenever anything doesn't go his way, and making himself look like a idiot that we can all [[lulz|laugh at]].

[[Alison]] stuck up for Jéské Couriano in his defence when his questionable admin activity was brought to the forefront at the [[Wikipedia Review]]. Her [[buttsecks|rebuttal]] went a little bit like this.

{{quote|1=As to Jéské, he got pretty badly [[butthurt|burned out]] on the Mudkipz meme thing back last year. It's like playing whack-a-mole and I guess it got to him. He's a [[recent changes patrol|vandal fighting type]] by nature and is largely [[asspie|hypersensitive]] to the whole Grawp thing. Dr. Allie recommends a cup of [[Stfu|cocoa]], a blankie and [[Drug|a chill-pill]] when it comes to matters Grawpish. He [[lolcow|takes things way too personally]], IMHO and that just leads to more burnout. [[Grawp]] is personal, [[Mudkipz]] is personal, [[Chan]]ners is personal, etc, etc. The way I see it, being angry and uncivil to vandals is a huge waste of [[shit nobody cares about|psychic energy]]. Do the job, tidy up and move on. It's like mopping up after an unruly toddler - DNFT and all that.|2=Alison, proving that at least she's a lot more [[sane]], [[old|mature]] and [[boring|down-to-earth]] than Jéské [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=19067 (sauce)]}}

Despite this, Jéské's [[baw]]wwwwwwwwwwing continues unabated. When the Wall Street Journal published its [[article]] about [[moot]]'s real identity, it also provided a [[reliable sources|reliable source]] for the Mudkip meme to be included in Wikipedia in some form.

{{quote|Another phrase "So I herd u like mudkips," a reference to a sea creature from the popular animated show "Pokémon," spawned thousands of tribute videos on [[YouTube]]. ... viral phenomenon. Here's at a few of them: ... "so i herd u like mudkips": Originally posted on another Web site, members of [[4chan]] adopted the phrase as in-joke. A "mudkip" is a lovable, water creature from the animated series Pokémon. You can watch some of the thousands of tribute videos on YouTube.|WALL STREET JOURNAL - July 9, 2008 - Modest Web Site Is Behind a Bevy of Memes}}

But that was not enough to satisfy the little Hitler we all know and hate.

{{quote|What part of "[[pedantic|Articles must be about the subject in question]]" do you not understand?|Jéské}}

Besides explaining why he had protected all mudkip-related articles such as those about [[IRL]] mudkips like Axolotl, Mudpuppy, and Mudskipper, he also went on to explain why he thought it would be better in the article about 4chan or the crappy Wikipedia list of internet phenomena. But then finally, after lots of argument, he exploded with rage.

{{quote|To all the [[anon]]s out there: '''[[BAWWWWWW|WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A BILLBOARD AND WE WILL DELETE SIHULM ON SIGHT UNLESS YOU PROVIDE RELIABLE SOURCES DIRECTLY DISCUSSING THE MEME. WE DO NOT TOLERATE SPAM ARTICLES AND WILL DELETE THEM ON SIGHT AS VANDALISM]]'''.

[[butthurt|Distraught]] about the liek of Mudkipz, Jéské protected the Mudkipz talk page from editing.  When criticized, he reported the user to his [[Bureaucratic_Fuck|admin fuckbuddies]] as a troll so they could [[ban|take care of him]].  To everyone's surprise, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=230156795#Cratylus3_.28talk_.C2.B7_contribs.29_baiting_me Jéské got his ass handed to him instead].

==More butthurt==
On June 14, 2010 Jeske decided to resign from his [[fake editor]] status in a storm of [[butthurt]] because some more [[abuse filter|software]] used to remove vandalism is going to be implemented. Clearly, there would be no [[lulz]] if vandalism were to be removed. He had to request to be banned because he's too much of an [[no life|addict]] to walk away on his own.

When nobody cared about him, he [[Wikicide|indefinitely blocked himself]].

==OMG de-sysopped==

Ultimately, TOW got too much for Jeske & he wikicided one time too many. He had spent an entire month [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=Jéské+Couriano&page=User%3AJéské+Couriano blocking himself] to protest against ''Fagged Revisions'', only to unblock hmself to "deal with [[rAIDS]]." This got too much for [[Tiptoety]] and Arbcom who told him to either GTFO or play the WikiGame. Ultimately, he pissed them off so much that he [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steward_requests/Permissions&curid=164533&diff=2037936&oldid=2037825&rcid=2144114 got de-sysopped].
