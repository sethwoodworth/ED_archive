FIRRIB
[[Image:FIRRIB.jpg|thumb|right|Gay robot drama spills out from the [[internets]] and into [[IRL]]!]]
FIRRIB is the easiest way to troll a [[Transformers]] community
and the most persuasive argument for rounding the entire [[fandom]] up and
[[final_solution|launching them into the sun]].
FIRRIB is not to be confused with [[FBI|FBIBRB]], a poster's last words before being v&.

== The Argument ==
FIRRIB is an [[acronym]] for 'Frenzy Is Red, Rumble Is Blue', or possibly
'[[gay|Faggot]] In [[ass|Rectum]], Require Intervention Bunghole'.  The
[[drama]] stems from the fact that two minor characters were colored differently
from their [[dildo|toy]] representations.  "Rumble" was blue in the cartoon, but
his toy was red.  "Frenzy" was red on TV but blue [[IRL]].  And that's it.  Seriously, that's all
there is.

== The Truth ==
[[Nobody_gives_a_shit|NOBODY GIVES A SHIT]].  The show was designed as toy
advertising for [[retarded]] children with [[ADD]], and the toys were
manufactured by sweatshop workers in some [[Good_Korea|third world hellhole]]. However, this doesn't stop a bunch of [[basement dwellers]] and [[Infantilism|adult
babies]] from treating the matter like a [[religion|religious]] crusade. The current theory is that lack of [[sex]] has shut down 90% of their brains.
