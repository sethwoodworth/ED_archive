[http://www.chatango.com Chatango] is a company that provides free webchat services to site operators.  The 
service is very similar to [[IRC]], only faggier because it's [[noob|easier to use]] and has [[attention whore|more customization features]].  The ease of use invites many budding [[weeaboo|weeaboos]] and the [[myspace|customization features]] attract [[attention whores]].

==The Worx==
Anyone can make a free account, and anyone with an account can create a room (similar to an IRC channel) and use some sharp [[HTML]] to embed a chat widget in their webpage.  It's advertised as a way for bloggers to make more AdWords money by enticing [[noone|readers]] into staying longer than good sense and taste would otherwise allow.  However, it is used more by lousy anime club sites than by lousy bloggers.

==Chatango Culture==

Just like any other service on the Internet, Chatango's users have developed a somewhat unique but utterly familiar culture.  There's some memes, to be sure, but mostly they're imports, smuggled in from [[b/]] by some enterprising Chatango player.  These smugglers quickly become the most popular members of any Chatango room, having the most "internet experience."  Encyclopedia Dramatica plays a role in this game of dominance.  "I love ED becuase it lets me enjoy the fun of 4chan without the nastiness of all the porn" is a phrase often encountered on Chatango.

===[[in the kitchen|Girls]]===

There aren't girls on the Internet, but there are girls on Chatango.  Be advised, though, [[gotis|GOTIS]] is an epidemic on Chatango in the same manner as Ebola rages in remote [[Africa|Congan]] villages.  Chatango girls claim to be bisexual as a rule, and will tease and tease with cutesy [[roleplaying]].  Chatango has a /me function that they use to send messages like "[[myspace|xXdarkgirlXx]] [[yiff|cuddles]] [[weeaboo|tanshitenkachi69]]."

===Mod Culture===

Chatango offers each user their own webpage, which can be modified to include some [[dox|helpful biographical information]], a pretty background [[animu|picture]], a user avatar, and, if the user is enough of a jerk, an autoplay [[mp3]] from their favorite band, probably like The Alkaline Trio or some j-rock band.


==Trolling==
Trolling Chatango can be quite an adventure.  It's easier than trolling [[Omegle]] because, for some dumb reason, ''nobody expects it'' and nobody knows not to feed the trolls.  The only real challenge to a troll on Chatango is that Chatango has a "flag" system.  When a [[obvious|troll]] is discovered, if three Chatango users "flag" the troll, he will be muted for a period of time.  [[Sockpuppets]] are easy to make, though, so troll victory is ensured.  Simple drama-induction schemes like discussing philosophy, science, religion and whatever controversies are relevant to the particular Chatango room's audience are the recommended route of action.  [[hax|Messing]] with the actual Chatango mechanism is pretty straightforward too.  Just spam a lot and make it impossible for anyone to have a coherent conversation what for the autoscrolling.  And, never forget that it's always a good time for hemorrhoid pictures.
