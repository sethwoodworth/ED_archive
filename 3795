Like most 15-year-old kids, Hughstan [[Masturbation|Schlicker]] was a compulsive MySpace user. Unlike most 15-year-old kids, Hughstan blew his father's head off with a shotgun when he was forced to quit MySpace cold  turkey.

==The Gory Details==
{{q2|It felt like I was stabbed with a knife and it went straight through and … no matter how hard I pulled, I couldn't pull out the knife|Hughstan Schlicker|On living without MySpace}}

Hughstan just wanted to do what all the other cool kids on Myspace were doing. So he started [[The An Heroes of Bridgend|leaving suicidal notes on his MySpace page]]. Unfortunately for Hughstan and his father, [[lolcow|someone]] took Hughstan seriously and called the [[police|cops]]. The police, in turn, called Hughstan's parents and urged  them to secure all of their guns lest Hughstan make good on [[an hero|his threat]]. Hughstan's father decided to go one better; he got straight to the root of the problem and took away Hughstan's internets.

Feeling [[e-penis|e-masculated]], Hughstan decided that he could best put his 16 newly-free hours of the day to use by cutting school and getting [[drugs|stoned]]. As he went into the garage to get a beer, Hughstan noticed that his father had, indeed, secured his shotgun—on the counter next to a box of shells.

At that moment, just like the Grinch who Stole Christmas, Hughstan thought of something he hadn't before—and that something was pretty fucking sadistic. Hughstan decided that he'd wait until his father got home, then give himself a 12-guage [[trepanation]] as his father looked on. However, there are many long hours in the average work day, and it didn't take Hughstan half of one of them to realize that he wouldn't be able to enjoy the [[lulz]] much without a face. Therefore, Hughstan made a list:

'''To Do'''
# Shoot father
# Shoot self

In a fit of industry, Hughstan even [[chickenshit|developed]] a schedule. He decided that if his father arrived home after 4:00pm, he wouldn't go through with his plan but, instead, live out his life secure in the smug superiority of what might have been. Luckily for all parties involved, Hughstan's father arrived home at 2:00pm—well before Hughstan's patricidal deadline. As his father walked into the kitchen Hughstan shot him in the back of the head, thereby doing something right for once.

Alas, remorse set in before Hughstan could complete his [[suicide|plan]] being dead, Hughstan's father couldn't very well make sure that his son [[DO IT FAGGOT|kept his word]]. Hughstan called up a [[friend zone|female acquaintance]] to [[confession|confess]]. Said friend talked [[attention whore|Hughstan]] into [[fail|not killing himself]] and convinced him to call the police instead.

And he did, and the size of Hughstan's penis is said to have shrunk 3 sizes that day.
