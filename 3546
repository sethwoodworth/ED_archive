[[At least 100 years ago]], some [[faggot]] named Shawn bought a Honda Del Sol. Because Honda Del Sols are [[gay]] and [[lame]], he decided to make it into a ''Star Wars'' X-Wing, which [[fail]]ed so he decided to call it an H-Wing, which kind of sounds like maxi-pads.

It is unclear if his wife Colleen actually uses it as a maxi-pad. However, it is a known fact that the H-Wing called the wrath of Lord Vader upon itself. Darth Vader slammed his mighty SUV upon the H-Wing in 2003, smashing it like the mighty [[banhammer]] on ED. Of course, this generated a lot of [[lulz]] in the community, in which a lot of people, in Shawn's own words, haet teh H-Wing Maxi Pad.

From teh website:

"How come [[anon|people]] attack you so much online?

"It's easy to flame when you don't have to take responsibility for anything you say. Plus, people are always afraid of what they don't understand, and a lot of people don't understand why I did this to my car. But it equals out; I don't understand a lot of the behaviors I [[Stalker|observe]]. But I [[Homo|don't]] publicly and anonymously attack people for it... :)"

==The great hot or not Colleen debate==

There is much doubt and uncertainty as to whether Shawn's concubine is hot or not. Therefore, her picture is posted here so that everyone can decide for themselves. Living in a basement and dreaming about Natalie Portman and Jean Luc Picard may contribute to thinking she's teh hot.

==H-Wing rip-offs==

There are many more X-Wing car rip-offs of the H-Wing. You may even see them cruising through your town. You can help by parking your Pinto really close to them or by carving the word [[lame]] in the paint. Or not, that's entirely up to you.
