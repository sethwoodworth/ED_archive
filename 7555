'''Skittletouch''' or '''Skittle Nigger''' is a new meme based on the popular Skittles commercial featuring a [[communism|working class]] man with the "Midas Touch" of Skittles. He is offered a stapler, touches it, and it turns into Skittles. The phone rings, Skittles. He pounds the desk... yep, you guessed it. SKITTLES. The concept of "Skittletouch" is likened to the concept of [[Divide by zero|dividing by zero]], as it is theorized that when this man touches Skittles, several things may happen to [[Delete fucking everything|cause the world to implode.]]

==Theories ==
People found the concept of turning everything he touches into Skittles humorous. Therefore, a thread was started and lulz ensued. However, once the lulz expired, the posters began to theorize, turning to [[science]] to provide answers to some well-posed questions. 

There are eleven theories when it comes to the Skittletouch powers of Skittle Nigger:

#Touching Skittles will have no effect, and he may consume all the Skittles he wants;
#Skittles will try to replicate themselves over and over, only destroying the matter that composed the original Skittle, so that any Skittles touched will be in a constant state of recreation;
#Same as 2, but the Skittles' replication destroys the original Skittle matter and begins to take over other types of matter, causing a chain reaction that takes over all known matter, eventually [[Everyone dies|consuming the universe]];
#Touches a full pack of Skittles, an uncomputable amount of energy is released, possibly creating a [[Divide by zero|new universe with its own mathematical laws]], [[Goatse|space]], [[Time for a Dicking|time]], and [[Portal|dimensions]].
#Touches Skittle/ full pack of Skittles and then those Skittles become M&M's/ full pack of M&M's; thus resulting in [[epic fail]] and we all become [[an heroes]] on [[Last Thursday]].
#He is usually naked (his skin touches the clothing) and surrounded by a pile of Skittles from all the things he's touched. The only way he can live normally is be completely naked and float in the air with molecules of [[over 9000]] Skittles for all [[At least 100 years|eternity]].
#He cannot consume the Skittles, or his entire digestive tract will turn into Skittles before it even touches his tongue.
#Only his hands or fingers hold the power of generating skittles from matter, considering the fact that he can wear clothing without it bursting into a skittly mess.
#His dick is made of skittles.
#If he had a [[16_year_old|daughter]] sticking it in her [[Vagina]] will result in your [[cock]] turning into skittles.
#Don't question theory #10 on how he would be able to have sex in the first place with his skittles touch powers.

== Origins and Limitations ==
It may be confusing how he got to be the way he is. It seems impossible that he has gone through life and thus far not [[An Hero|killed himself]] or somehow [[Final Solution|discovered a solution to his problem]]. It seems that he happened upon his power randomly one day, loving it at first but then coming to [[DO NOT WANT|hate it,]] just like the actual King Midas!
