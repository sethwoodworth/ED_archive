LAN Party
A '''LAN party''' is a gathering of [[acne|spotty]], [[basement-dwelling]] [[virgins]] who bring along their [[computers]].  Together, they create a network for multiplayer [[gaming]], file sharing and collective [[masturbation]].

The size of LAN parties can vary from just a couple of people, to [[over 9000]] in the case of the world record holders DreamHack.

==How LAN parties developed==

The first ever LAN party took place [[at least 100 years ago]] at the home of a small group of bored [[teenagers]] who regularly met up to play [[Quake]].  However, coming from the [[USA]] they soon found they were too [[fat]] to fit into their own living room, and so the search began for a more spacious venue.  Eventually they found a space at their local [[McDonalds]], where they were able to get through the doors comfortably and stuff their faces whilst [[gaming]].

Gradually, through the overconsumption of hamburgers, they managed to outgrow McDonalds.  As more and more [[niggers|homies]] tagged along, they had to move to larger venues to keep up with the demand.

Nowadays, LAN parties tend to be organised on a much greater scale, usually by people who want to try out their planning and [[Unwarranted self-importance|leadership]] skills.

Vast amounts of electricity are required for such events.  This usually results in either a power cut for everyone else living locally, or, more preferably, [[death|electrocution]] for the participants.

==Culture==

LAN parties often last through to the early hours of the morning; not a problem for the participants, since none of them have [[girlfriends]] and they enjoy the novelty of staying up all night.  They typically stay awake by consuming sugar and [[Drug|caffeine]]-laden energy drinks, in a gesture of support towards the world [[diabetes]] crisis.

==Things to bring to a LAN party==

*[[computer]]
*[[Big Brother|Monitor]]
*Mouse – although [[a cat is fine too]]
*Headphones – because after the sleep deprivation, you’ll need to listen to some music to drown out the voices in your head
*Pirated software
*Energy drinks or soda so you can stay up until 3 in the fucking morning, wasting more of your life. 
*Pizza or other high-fat foods to make you fatter and fatter.

==Things to leave at home==

*[[Condoms]] – It is very unlikely that you will score at a LAN party, even if you like dudes.
*[[Your mom]]

==LAN Parties around the world==

LAN Parties have become popular in different parts of the world:
*In China, a typical LAN Party would have whoever gets a kill or point to yell out "GUNG POW CHOI".
*Bulgaria is most notorious for their LAN Parties which would get very messy (pictured right).
*In 2008, Pakistan had band LAN Parties after a group was caught defusing a bomb in Counter-Strike.
*In Australia, it's common for when an American player kills an Australian player, the result being the Australian calling the American a Canadian.

==LAN Bachelor Parties==

{{quote|I've only been to one bachelor party in my [[basement dweller|life]], and it was a bachelor LAN party. A bunch of [[virgin|close friends]] brought their computers over the night before the wedding, [[lie|drank beer]], played [[13-year-old boy|Quake and Worms Armageddon]], and just generally [[swearing|shot the shit]]. It was [[fail|awesome]].

A bachelor party with strippers and prostitutes would probably have just been really [[not gay|uncomfortable]] and [[not gay|awkward]] for [[not gay|everyone]] involved. |Some little pussy on a message board}}
