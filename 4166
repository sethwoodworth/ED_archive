JFK Reloaded
[[Image:Ssgethit9em.gif|thumb|]]
[[Image:BrainShot.gif|thumb| BOOM! BRAINSHOT BITCH!ยง >:(]]
This is the sweetest [[FPS|first person shooter]] ever. You're Lee Harvey Oswald, and you have to race the grassy knoll shooter through eight worlds to reach Dealey Plaza. The end boss is [[JFK]]'s limo, which [[Transformers|transforms into a robot]] and shoots plasma missiles at you. Hit it three times and it's dead. You can also unlock [[The War of Northern Aggression|John Wilkes Booth]], [[christfag|Charles Guiteau]], [[Anarchy|Leon Czolgosz]], and [[basement dweller|John Hinckley]] as secret characters.

[[Alcoholic | Ted Kennedy]] later woke up after <strike>a hard night of drinking</strike> a series of seizures to sue the awesome guy who made it.

Extreme [[Ragdoll Physics]] can be seen here.
