Whiskey is [[alcohol]] for [[redneck|cuntry]] folk.  Also known as [[fire]]<nowiki>water</nowiki> to [[Native Americans|Primitives]], whiskey is the reason the South was a little slow on [[Civil War|getting rid of]] things like [[slavery]].  Oops, sorry black persons, we'll make it up to you by listening to you bitch about [[racism]] for the next 3 centuries.

Whiskey is usually a one-time thing, since after drinking it you'll get so hammered that you'll [[never drinking again|never drink again]].  Except for all those other times before when you drank it, but those don't count because you stopped drinking afterwards every time.

# Driving drunk and killing people who [[asking for it|had it coming]].
