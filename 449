'''[http://twitter.com/andreaurbanfox  AndreaUrbanFox]''' is a self-proclaimed "Dangerous Talker" and [[blogger]]/[[loser]]/[[spammer]]/[[stalker]] from [[London]] who suddenly decided she was a [[victim]] of [[Trent Reznor]] @ [[Twitter]]. The [[bitch|old Brazilian fart]] claimed she "only" wanted to make people aware of thousands of Brazil flood victims ([[cry moar|boohoo]]) and decided to bring attention to them by shitting all over [[Trent Reznor|Trent's]] own [http://weloveeric.com/ charity efforts]. [[retarded|Brilliant!]]  This led to her being "[[INTERNET_HATE_MACHINE |attacked]]" by Reznor on Twitter for being a total [[fucktard]]. She also conveniently [[Flame_Wars |forgot]] that she had been calling [[Trent Reznor|Trent's]] woman Mariqueen a [[Dickgirls|chick with a dick]] before [[Trent Reznor|Trent]] called her out for being a [[sad]], little [[troll]] desperate for attention and blog hits.

Her [[lonely|hobbies]] include being hated everywhere she goes on [[internet|da webz]], whining about [[censorship]], getting [[banned|booted]] from [[facebook|social]] [[last.fm|networking sites]] for being an insufferable cunt, and airbrushing the everlasting [[shit]] out of her pictures.

[[Facebook|Reliable sources]] tells us she is related to Mark David Chapman[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_David_Chapman], the famous [[Sociopath|über 1337 stalker]] (which is obvious if you look at the picture.)

== The lulz ==
'''[[Trent Reznor|Trent]]''' responded to the offending [http://twitter.com/AndreaUrbanFox/status/1946567877 attack tweet] with this pearl of wisdom and [[lulz]]: "You know what else sucks? You."  The [[fat|plump]] [[troll]] didn't [[truth|approve]] of this and started an [[pathetic|epic]] [[internet]] [[Fundamentalist|crusade]] against [[Trent Reznor]] and Mariqueen on [[Twitter]]. [[Hate]], [[lulz]], and [[bitter]] [[fangirl]] tears showed up all over [[internet|da webz.]] Andrea put her sausage-like fingers to work and produced a metric fuckton of blogs about [[Trent Reznor]] and how he has ruined her life. The blog feedback was positive, with comments ranging from "It's ok. I guess." to "sry. thought this was [http://fatchicksinpartyhats.com fatchicksinpartyhats.com]." After all the [[attention]] the [[fat|slightly overweight]] ([[lol]]) [[transvestite]] [[pig]] got, [[Basement-dweller|Andrea]] became even more of a [[psychotic]]-[[obsession|obsessed]]-[[cunt]]-[[troll]] and continues to [[stalk]] and [[harassment|harass]] both [[Trent Reznor]] and Mariqueen on [[Twitter]] and her [[YOU_ARE_DOING_IT_WRONG|blog]].

== AndreaUrbanFAIL ==

Reading [[attention whore|Andrea's]] [[Twitter]] page is akin to poking yourself in the eye with a sharp stick. Repeatedly.

Andrea doesn't care about <s>black people</s> people who need heart transplants: {{quote|I cant say I care much for Eric or his family, sorry.|AndreaUrbanFox via some shitty blog.}}

[[Obviously]] she gets totally [[fucked up]] when she smokes her [[crack]], since she apparently has her [[blonde]] moments:

== The Reznor Factor: Motivations Explained ==

Andrea likes to pretend that her [[obsession|preoccupation]] with [[Trent Reznor|Reznor]] is not in anyway related to her desire to [[furry|FUCK HIM LIKE AN ANIMAL]]. The [[internets]] say otherwise. 
[[Image:Andreafails 04.JPG|center|DO NOT WANT.]]
'''[[Obsession]]''' breeds [[insanity]] and [[lulz]]:

{{quote|I had a dream about you. In the dream we go out for a romantic meal.
I think it was a japonese restaurant because they seated us in a little closed off booth...very cosy...very private...We enjoyed our food with a nice bottle of ice cold sake......I kick of my heels without you noticing a thing and  started to gently rub my feet up and down your legs....Slowly moving up inside your trouser legs....You acted surprise at first but then smiled at me as if daring me to go further....We maintain eye contact all the time...No words were spoken....All we needed to say to each other was said with our eyes.....I get a bit braver.. started  rubbing my feet in your lap....I can feel you getting bigger and I press down a little harder and you let go a deep sigh, almost a groan.....Then you unbutton your fly and lean back.....You are in ecstasy.... I can feel you, hot and big in between my feet....I can see the pleasure the lust in your eyes....I want more, you want more......But the waitress comes into out booth....We compose ourselves & pay the bill and leave giggling, happy, horny.....It's raining outside....We're both feeling very horny.....Gagging to feel, to taste each other....You grab me as we walk down the street....Pushing me up against a bus shelter.. ..It's late and the rain is getting stronger....There is nobody about....We start to kiss passionately.... Our hands moving all over each others bodies...Again we become totally turned on...Your hand up my skirt....My hand inside your trousers....We almost reach our climax.....but we just stop ourselves.......|'''AndreaUrbanFox''' wants da [[sex]] with [[Trent Reznor]], From [http://tinyurl.com/l56zel A Dreamers Dream] [[blog]] entry.}}
