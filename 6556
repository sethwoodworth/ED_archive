'''Porygon''' ('''ポリゴン''' in [[moonspeak]]) is a [[Pokémon]] introduced in the Red and Blue games; its name comes from [[Fail|the Japanese's inability to write and pronounce "Polygon"]] correctly. It appeared in its very own episode of the shitty Pokeman [[animu]], where it saved Ash and the gang from Team Rocket's [[rape]] traps once again. 

What makes this particular Pokeman unique is the fact that it instantly pwnd and obliterated [[over 9000]] [[Shota|Japanese boys]] by triggering mass epilepsy. The United States was most butthurt over this, because half a century earlier they attempted the same thing but destroyed a lot of useful infrastructure in the process. In other words, Porygon is a hugeass motherfucking H-bomb without the collateral damage.  Of course nobody gave a [[shit]] about them since they were Japanese and instead got pissed off that they didn't think of it first.

==The Aftermath==
Immediately the Japanese government got real and decided to take a stance over the incident, sending in armies of [[Nazi]]s and [[loli|schoolgirls]] to investigate. It was not long before the population of [[13 year-old boy]]s in Japan was cut by [[at least 100|at least 100 people]].

[[Scientists]] [[Shit nobody cares about|believe that the flashing lights triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli such as flashing lights can cause altered consciousness. Although scientists know that approximately 1 in 4,000 people (0.5–0.8% of children between 5–13 years old) are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by this Pokémon episode was unprecedented.]] Oh, but those silly Azns simply didn't have the proper medical knowledge shared throughout the western world, and decided to go ahead and [[lol|air the episode without checking a medical journal]].

Porygon's [[GRIDS|moment of glory]] was [[Banhammer|banned]] worldwide after, as other countries did not wish to expose their populations to it.

==Facts==
*[[Obama|Saddam Hussein]] was thought to have possessed this Pokémon, and as a result the War on Iraq began for control of the [[gun|weapon of mass destruction]].

*Just as [[Pedobear]] is the mascot of pedophiles, Porygon is the mascot of both [[H4x0r]]s and the [[Basement dweller|Geek Squad]].
*Porygon's name is the way that all [[azn|azns]] pronounce "Polygon", a translating stunt that continues to provide [[lulz]] to the American [[Goatse|assholes]] that beat those damn Japs at their own game.
