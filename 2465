'''drp1zza''' (aka '''Allan Ernest Caesar III''') and brother of [[SilentRob]], is yet another case of unfounded [[USI|megalomania]] from the greasy [[taint]] that is YouTube's [[vlog]]ger "community".  Allan's a [[socially retarded]] 24 year old [[ITG|keyboard warrior]] and [[batshit]] trailer-trash [[Christfag]] who has [[unrealistic expectations|high hopes]] for [[YouTube]] (and his Dad's eternal jobhunt).  Allan has left a sizeable [[shitstain]] on the tubes with a [[tl;dw|1000+]] videos centered mostly on [[issues]] that [[niggers|bother him]], with the odd train-wreck fit of aspie [[rage]] thrown in for good measure.  The [[lulz]] have mostly sprung from Allan's decision to make "vlogs" though, as he tends to speak in a [[HURR|unintelligible]], [[retarded|lethargic]] tone as if he's permanently [[drunk]] or [[lulz|chewing his own face whilst speaking]].  He lives in a [[Redneck|double-wide]] on a steady diet of [[welfare|government cheese]] with his dad, and graduated from high school in 2007 at the age of 22.  Allan is [[notable]] only for being '''''the''''' definition of [[white trash]] on YouTube.  

==History==
[[Image:drp1zza.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[X Y is X|Unsuccessful troll is unsuccessful]].]]
[[Aspierations|For some reason]] Allan feels the need to show the world his glamorous life in the trailer park, but he originally began his video posting days as merely another [[YouTube Nobodies|YouTube nobody]], shitting out [[professional wrestling]] [[fanboy|fanboyism]], and "[[LOLWUT|play-by-play video game commentary videos]]".  Alan eventually succumbed to the vlogging bug, though, and that's when the [[lulz]] began to gush.  It wasn't long before Allan revealed himself to be a product of that [[redneck|demographic]] of [[Americunts|America]] that considers a 'night on the town' dinner at [[McDonald's]] and drinking daddy's moonshine, and never minds dropping his thoughts on [[kitchen|women]].  He eventually began posting lulzy [[rage]] videos and [[whaaambulance|whiny]] and [[retard|slurred]] commentaries about his pathetic life and/or whatever his seratonin deprived [[brain]] could manage at any given time.  In doing so, he also eventually revealed the obvious: that he was an IRL [[aspie]].  

When he's not sucking [[Sxephil]]'s cock extensively, he can be caught attempting to goad [[anon]] in a series of bawwwfests about [[trolls]], whining about [[:Image:Tiny_penis.jpg|why he hates women]] and [[niggers|minorities]], about how the [[victim complex|entire world is out to get him]], or threatening to "[[LOLWUT|
take down]]" ED.  The only real exposure to the YouTube mainstream Allan has ever received, though, has been due to his incessant whining about "[[haters]]" and people making fun of his [[mongoloid]]-like [[fugly|appearance]] and [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|speech]].

[[Image:Aspie button pin.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Allan is an aspie, and proud of it.]]

==Signs of [[Autism|PDD]]: ==
Allan is an [[aspie]] [[IRL]], here's a general breakdown of the typical symptoms of full-blown [[autism]]:
*General delay in language/speech &#10004;
*Verbosity  &#10004;
*Motor clumsiness  &#10004;
*Pedantic  &#10004;
*Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject <span style="text-decoration:blink;"><big><big><big>&#10004;</big></big></big></span>

<big><u>Note</u></big>: It's important to remember that autism is often genetically inherited from parents, '''especially fathers'''. 

==Allan's  Lulzy [[Ragequit]]==
[[Image:drp1zza stalker drops dox1.jpg|thumb|left|Alan drops [[dox]] on some random chick before closing his account. Unfortunately, suicide did not follow.]]  
[[Image:drp1zza channel return.jpg|thumb|right|"Everything's fine guys, I'm totally not crazy".]]
Allan was optimistic that he was going to break free of the [[no friends|social]], [[unemployed|financial]] and [[autism|genetic]] constraints that put him where he is after he decided to try his hand at the local [[ITT Tech|community college]].  Things often don't work out for Allan though, and after a shitload of [[cry]]ing about how hard it was he later revealed that he was [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNECViAJIS4 kicked out] because he was matter-of-factly [[IRL]] [[stalking]] a girl on campus.  He became [[suicidal]] as a result, and after several videos where he [[raged]] about teh [[wiminz]], he posted a video out of the blue dropping [[dox]] on an "ex-girlfriend" from years ago that wanted nothing to do with him (most likely some random chick who turned his psycho ass down years ago in highschool).  Allan [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|closed up shop]] shortly thereafter around the end of February, [[2008]].  

Unfortunately, Allan never [[an hero|did the right thing]] or learn anything from the numerous [[self-pwn]]s and [[footbullet]]s.  After begging YouTube to re-open his account he returned about a month later to eat up more YouTube [[bandwidth]] to shit out moar of his [[SNCA|nonsense]] and [[racist|bigoted]] faggotry.  Since his return he mostly just [[spam]]med the same [[retarded|asinine]] bullshit as before, with the occasional lulzy stupor-like [[fucktarded]] faggotry as always, thankfully.  But, all things considered, Allan is one of the more potent examples of the [[Psychopath|psychotic]] Youtuber.  He is a true [[lolcow]] as he has shown the propensity to manifest his ineffectual [[rage|e-rage]] via lulzy train-wreck videos, although it's unclear if he'll ever [[limit break]] again and let his inner-[[Jeffrey Dahmer]] out. But [[trolling]] is highly encouraged so as to increase the [[lulz]] factor by reminding him of the festering pile of [[dogshit]] that his life is.   

==Reaction to Wikification==
[[Image:Dr_pizza_is_angry_and_will_kill_you.gif|thumb|right|200px|just lol]]
When Allan discovered his ED article he went into an expected fit of aspie [[rage]] and made the following video in haste, shortly before closing his account... 

Although Allan leaving the tubes (again) was probably a good thing in the long run, since he ate up shitloads of [[bandwidth]] with his constant [[spam]] and [[meaningless noise]], his hasty exit also greatly decreased the [[lulz]] factor.  Allan disappeared from the tubes altogether so whether he'll decide to return again and bring us lulz is yet to be seen, although it's probably safe to assume he's still a [[perma-virgin]], not [[unemployed|employed]], and definitely not of [[psychotic|sound mind]].   

==Update==
[[Image:Drp1zza_mcd_clown.PNG|thumb|right|Allan's mcfaggotry is extensive]]
Allan reopened his account (again).  All his old videos have been removed, but judging by history he'll probably start spamming his [[rage]] sometime soon.  

Allan's account was [[banned|"suspended"]] by [[YouTube]] not long after, most likely because he called another user a [[niggers|nigger]] yet again so somebody gave him a taste of his own medicine and flagged his ass.  >Whether he resurfaces on another account and continues to [[spam]] the [[YouTube|tubes]] with more of his [[lulz|lulzy]] meltdown videos, faggy [[Flame_wars|flame wars]] and [[Aspie|assburger]] [[retarded|retardism]] remains to be seen.  lol jk, they always come back.

Allan made his return to [[YouTube]] (yet the fuck again but there's a reason) under a new account name <s>{{youtube2|AllanDrPizza|AllanDrPizza}}</s> '''(BANNED)''' due to a troll recent poser account named <s>{{youtube2|drp1zzaacwl|drp1zzaacwl}}</s> '''(also now banned)'''. lulz expected. <br />

Big surprise he ran away again, but not before threatening to sue [[ED]]. FUCKING LOL.  

{{quote|1=Im being slandared, seriously harrased and my privacy is being invaded by your contributors at the article of drp1zza.

I would be very relieved if you put an end to it, your a woman, and therefor i dont think your an asshole, and yes i made an ass out of myself, but you know what? We ALL have our dark secrets, and yes i did post those videos, its one thing to have people laugh at me for the stupid shit i did... but it is completly different when you are stalking me, invading my privacy, and using this website as your own personal army. Thats a big difference...

Please email me at allan_iii@charter.net ASAP, if no action is taken by you guys, im sure Media Wiki will, and if they dont. Then yeah... lawsuits... not LULZuits.. lawsuits...|2=[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Talk:Girlvinyl&diff=prev&oldid=1998129992 drp1zza], threatening [[girlvinyl]] with [[Mediawiki|Media Wiki]].

{{blueblink|<big>[[I'M PRESSIN CHARGES]]</big>}}

Since being scared off [[JewTube]] and the interwebz; Allan spends his time on Xbox Live doing the same exact shit he did on YouTube: Bitch and moan.

*Apparently he has come back to Youtube again, and has been hiding under the alias '''PLEEZENinja'''. He's even uploaded videos of him playing Street Fighter against his cat. Check out his videos, still full of the aspie trailer trash fail like the other ones. '''UPDATE:''' That account has now been closed, after an argument over Street Fighter on XBOX live. 

{{quote|1=Im not Dr. Pizza anymore, that was a person i was ashamed of being... if those jackasses want to laugh at my past, let them. but its not gonna affect me anymore.}}

*Dr. Pizza then pulled a [[SRSLY|PLOTTWIST!]] and now [[WTF|approves his own ED Article]].  Mainly because he realized if [[you|shitheads]] didn't create this.  He would of probably ended up locked up in an Asylum for being a [[Psychopath]]. As a result, [[what|he grew the fuck up]]. And thanks you for this, and agrees that his vid's are [[lulz]] worthy.

*Dr. Pizza changed his xbox live gamertag from Allan Caesar to D0ntTaseM3Br0 . fucking faggot
==Feline AIDS==
[[Image:AIDscat2.png|thumb|right|300px|An artists impression of Sammy, before painful death.]]

A [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z233YThqGng video dedicated to his cat] was posted by Allan in a [[Mass Effect]] thread on a Jew.

{{tinyquote|1=There were some people on here who got mad at me for getting [[Mass Effect 2]] CE when my cat was sick... which i do deep down feel like an asshole.. but it wouldnt of mattered :'(

My cat had Feline AIDS, yes.. AIDS... even if we would of took him right away.. it wouldnt of mattered.. he died today.. and im very empty.

For anyone that doesnt think that i loved my cat more then video games, your an asshole :'( im not trying to troll. i just want to clear that up.

It costs hundreds of dollars to take care of a cat.. i didnt have all that money... i had my CE on pre-order guys... and we honestly thought he was gonna recover.. we had no idea..

He died today in my arms... i promised him id be with him for the rest of his life, and i was... i was the last thing he saw before he died... his eyes were open looking into me as he died... :'(

Im not here to cause any flaming. i just want to state for the record. that even if i didnt get the game, it wouldnt of made a difference. Yes a video game cant replace my cat. But im just happy i knew my buddy Sammy for those 3 years... :'( id gladly give all my video games away for him to be healthy and alive right now....

So for anyone who thought i was evil. I just want to state ONLY once, that i am sorry if you felt that way, but if you still think that way. then forgive me french, but just... stay away from me. dont say shit to me :'(

Thank you, and i hope everyone is enjoying there Mass Effect 2. as well as being around there loved ones and pets.

God Bless.

Allan}}

[[Image:Pizzakittygrave.jpg|thumb|right|300px|It had to be done.]]
This moral choice added +17 to his Renegade status.

The post was soon deleted and '''Drp1zza''', who watches this article like a fucking hawk, decided to godhand this little piece of history from existence:

{{tinyquote|Revert, do not talk shit about my cat, i took him to the vet, if you want to keep attacks on me, thats fine, but i ask you to [[Chris Crocker|leave my cat out of this]]... If your a human being, you would understand.|[[User:Dr._Pizza|drp1zza]]|[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Drp1zza&diff=1998303479&oldid=1998303203]}}

[[User:Sheneequa|Shenigger]] noticed our friend trying to change his article, and smelling a freshly bleeding asshole, mobilised [[ED:IRC|ED's]] elite [[Internet Detective]] squad to determine what happened to the cat.

===Theories===
====Drugs====
[[Image:Cocktails.jpg|thumb|right|Drug cocktails for poor Sammy...]]
[[Image:Drpizzacatjunkie.jpg|thumb|left|Sammy the junkie]]
Our Detectives first noted that drp1zza, a redneck, was probably taking crack, or some other poor person's drug. Thus, is could be assumed that Sammy the Cat was also a user, and may have been infected by a dirty needle.
{{clear}}
[[Image:Theory-3.png|thumb|right|Furpiles were a favourite]]
[[Image:Theory-2.png|thumb|left|This scene is too much to bear for us]]
[[Image:Theory-4.jpg|thumb|right|Vampiric cats]]

====Promiscuous Sex====
Friends and onlookers have come out to say that Sammy was involved in massive sexual orgies, sometimes lasting days, depending what drugs he was taking at the time. We all know gaysex is an excellent way to spread AIDS, so ED Detectives have not ruled out the possibility of promiscuous cat sex being the cause.

====Beastiality====
We all know '''drp1zza''' is a little funny in the head, and he did love Sammy a little too much. Therefore, it is fair to conjecture that '''drp1zza''', deranged from AIDS, has been fucking Sammy for some time, and thus infecting him too. These are troubled times.

====Vampirism====
Perhaps Sammy had a fetish for drinking blood, and just maybe he drank one too many vials of "bad blood", resulting in an AIDS infection. Some might like to point fingers at '''drp1zza''' forcing Sammy to sit through audiobooks of [[Twilight]] with him, but we also cannot rule out the extreme lifestyle that was forced on the cat led to the thin edge of the wedge, getting a lot fatter.

===Drp1zza's Reaction===
[[Image:SAVEJERREH.png|thumb|right|It was too late]]
Unfortunately, '''drp1zza's''' nonchalant reaction to feline AIDS probably caused the violent, excruciating death of his beloved kitty-cat. We at the ED Justice Department denounce his "LOL MASS EFFECT 2" treatment, suggesting such cruel and unusual punishment of a sick cat should not go unpunished. Here, at EncyclopediaDramatica, we take animal cruelty very, VERY [[srs bsns|seriously]] and think everyone should go [http://www.aspca.org/fight-animal-cruelty/report-animal-cruelty.html here] and dump any [[dox]] of his [[Drp1zza#External_Links|you can find]].<br><br>
[[Image:PizzaComic.png|border|center|600px]]

===Pressing Charges===
Let's say this cat saga has, dare we say, ''rubbed him up the wrong way''. Angry at his "life being ruined", he has called [[User:Vonranke|Vonranke]] [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=User_talk%3AVonranke&diff=1998303615&oldid=1998302595 worse than Hitler], and going to [[TOW]] to ask for advice in suing ED.

{{q2|[[Your]] worst then Adolf Hitler.|[[User:Dr. Pizza|drp1zza]]|at least he got 'Adolf Hitler' right.}}

{{q2|I seriously want to take them to court for the damages they have done to me. Does anyone know what i can do to do something about this?|[[User:Dr. Pizza|drp1zza]]|3=[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclopedia_Dramatica&diff=prev&oldid=340504903 on TOW]}}

We wish you luck, and hope you have an [[User:Weev|ace Attorney at LOL]].

===[[ED:IRC|ED IRC]]===
Otherwise known as "why you need an Attorney at LOL", '''drp1zza''' accepted the courteous invitation to attend a chat on [[IRC]]. Not thinking ahead, and full of hubris, '''drp1zza''' charged in and was directed to #wiki, where all the cool kids hang out. This little excursion however, cost him a permaban:
