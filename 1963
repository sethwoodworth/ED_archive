'''DJ SkeptiK''' is a [[13 year old boy]] from the [[internets]] with [[unlimited disposable income]].

== The story ==
The drama began on the [[shitty]] game [[WoW]] when a kid claimed he owned a website who had a partnership with [[beer|Budweiser]].

In search of [[lulz]], eberly stumbled upon the website and researched that DJ SkeptiK was [[rich and beautiful]] and decided to commemorate a website in his honor.

=== The result ===
The post sparked an uprise of [[drama]] and massive amounts of [[lulz]] ensued.  A friend of DJ SkeptiK, named sweethooves, came to his aid, only to have her picture [[pwned]] with a [[cock|penis]] in it.

== The peoples ==

=== Sweethooves ===
Sweethooves is a [[fatty]] and a [[redneck]], an [[friend| internet friend]] of SkeptiK who sticks up for him throughout the story, to her loss.

=== Jinx, the [[internet lawyer]] ===
Jinx is the self-proclaimed "CEO of Blizzhackers.com", a site which as of now doesn't exist, but you can probably bet it was a haven for [[13 year old boys]] and ''[[Starcraft]]'' [[fags]].  Jinx, as a qualified [[e-lawyer]], had skilled teams working on the ruining of Eberly's and Jammno's lives.  Thanks to the work of Jinx, DJ SkeptiK has successfully taken Jammno and Eberly to [[internet court]], suing Jammno for $10,000 worth of [[internet money]]. Both Eberly and Jammno are in [[internet jail]] to this day. Seen [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Image:Jinx.gif here]

=== Jammno ===
[[Jammno]] plays ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and gets it all the [[fag|time]].
