Rotten.com
{{shock}}

A legendary [[internet phenomenon]] site for necrophilic and [[snuff]]-loving people, filled with gruesome tales and gory photos. It was started in 1958 by the [[Disney]] Corporation.  Also has a pretty nice collection of information texts regarding people and events, known as the Rotten Library.

Widely regarded as being more historically accurate and less biased than [[Wikipedia]].

== Sections ==
[[Image:Rotten.jpeg|thumb|Front page description]]
[[Image:Rotten.jpg|thumb|One of the many beautiful pics you can find on Rotten.com]]

There are a lot of sections to the site, but let's focus on the main ones.

=== Mainpage ===

This is where the magic happens. You can see some nasty images or read some daily news about [[Pedo|child molesters]] and murderers.  Every few months they add a page or two, featuring at least one image and usually some informative text about it.  Occasionally, a Rotten Library page is posted here as well.

===NNDB===

NNDB is still in its infancy, but <s>worth a glance</s> already full of [[fail]]. It covers all [[Famous|noteworthy]] people, living or dead. It is notable for <s>calling everyone a faggot</s> being operated by biased [[faggots]].

===The Library===

The Rotten Library is infamous for combining Rotten and [[Wikipedia]] together, except it isn't biased and can't be edited by faggots. It's written with a wit and intelligence that is sadly lacking in whoever initially wrote this stub. The front page contains the following introductory:

{| align="center" style="padding:0px;  margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;  width:700px;"
|<div style="text-align: justify;"><i>Welcome, friends, to the Rotten Library, an unforgettable collection of all that mankind swore to forget, but which we have trapped in agonizing clarity to remember always. Step carefully and remember the location of the eyewash stations as we present to you the lowest that we have traveled and the worst of what we have become. Enjoy! And remember the words of our head librarian:</i></div><br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><i>"We are all in this together, but we all die alone."</i></div>
|}

== Censorship by Patriot Act ==
[[Image:Edsgran.jpg|thumb|right|Thanks to the [[Government|US Government]], Rotten.com no longer features beautiful pictures such as this in their ''Fuck Of The Month'' section.]]
As of '''June 24th, 2005''', a great deal of content throughout the website (ie. the [http://fotm.rotten.com/fotm/ Fuck Of The Month Club]) was removed due to the newly imposed [[Shit nobody cares about|federal record-keeping statute]] 18 U.S.C. 2257.  This basically made it mandatory to provide records of all the [[Whore|hot bitches]] on your site to prove that they weren't [[Jailbait|underage]], as part of the mighty [[W|Emperor Bush]]'s plot to overthrow freedom of speech and replace it with [[Freedom#Freedom_2.0|Freedom v2.0]].  This was indeed a wise move on his part, for it is common knowledge that the [[Terrorism|greatest threats]] to [[America]] stem from a bunch of [[Snuff|disgusting pictures]] on the [[Internet]].

Fortunately the Wayback Machine [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://fotm.rotten.com/fotm/ got the whole thing on tape].

==Vengeance==

Rotten.com is well known on the internets as a source of shock images that are all [[at least 100]] years out of date. A common revenge tactic when feeling [[butthurt]] about something is to run over to Rotten, grab four or five images of car-crash victims or weird tumors, and spam the fuck out of whatever forum has offended you. This tactic is usually full of [[fail]] because most whiners are either too dumb or too [[Pussy|weak in the stomach]] to find and use the [[Pain series|effective stuff]], and everybody laughs at them for thinking the [[Harlequin Ichthyosis Fetus|Harlequin baby]] is hardcore.
