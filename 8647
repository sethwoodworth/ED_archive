Ubuntu (moar liek '''JEW'''buntu, amirite?) is currently the most popular [[Lunix]] distribution funded by [[wigger|Mark Shuttleworth's]] Canonical Ltd. It is said to have [[over 9000]] users, although this may not be true because Ubuntu users are known to download Ubuntu [[at least 100]] times while fapping to it downloading. Ubuntu's popularity is due to it being ridiculously [[Windows|easy to use]], yet still empowering users with the arrogance and [[unwarranted self importance]] that goes along with using [[Lunix]]. The Ubuntu project is built on the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu philosophy, including that software should be available [[communist|free of charge]] and that software tools should be usable by people in their [[ebonics|native language]]- important goals for a distribution that targets [[niggers|Africans]], but the [[shit|earthy brown]] theme, jungle drums, and [[Apple|simple interface]] has a wider appeal than its common name, "Debian for niggers" suggests, reaching beyond the black person community to most of the Lunix-using community.

== Debian ==
Ubuntu is based on Debian, a distribution known for its [[basement dweller|excellent]] package management and selection of packages, including such excellent games as [[Awesome|The Battle for Wesnoth]] and [[Shit|Quake Live]]. Ubuntu has packages for everything, including some faulty wireless drivers- but in order to connect to the [[porn|internets]] to download them, you need to reboot into [[Windows]].

{{quote|Ubuntu is to Debian as UFW is to iptables|Typical Debian [[loser|user]]}}

== The Ubuntu Community ==
One of the strongest selling points of the Ubuntu distribution is its shitty community and [[Lie|excellent community support]].  Ubuntu community members often sign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct and get it [[Assrape|notarized]] in [[internet court]], after which they call themselves ''[[faggots|ubunteros]]''.  Provisions of this code include platitudes and [[bondage|blind obedience]] to [[Jane Silber]].

== Web Forums ==
The Ubuntu community has a strong Internet presence, including a vast and helpful web [[forum]].  [[Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhh|It's easy to ask a question- simply post a new thread with your question.]]  It is encouraged to [[DO IT FAGGOT|search for similar postings before asking.]]  The first few posts after your question will probably be other people agreeing that they have the same problem or asking you to visit [[spammer|their mini city]], but if you wait long enough, you might get a real answer, such as:

1) "You are a fucking [[noob]] who is too dumb for [[Lunix]] and you should just stick to [[Windows]]" (these tend to be [[banned]] by the [[admin]] and end up posting their [[shit]] on the [http://forum.myspace.com MySpace forums])

2) "(Link to a previous thread describing the same problem) - Please use the search function next time. LOCKED."

3) A long and laborious set of arcane, daemonic chants that you write down on paper, reboot into Lunix, and then type in the terminal.  These usually will do what you want them to do, if you wanted [[your mom]] [[rape|raped]], your [[cat]] run down and your problem only half fixed, to bite you in the ass later.

Expecting Ubunteros who have accepted the Ubuntu Code of Conduct [[Unrealistic expectations|to be answering their questions]], Ubuntu users will enter just about anything short of 'sudo rm -rf /' into their terminals.  You might try telling one to overwrite /var/lib/dpkg/status, thus ruining his package management, or /etc/hostname, thus preventing him for using 'sudo'.

== #ubuntu moar liek #unhelpful ==
Don't bother trying to flood #ubuntu on freenode. It already is flooded, 24 hours a day, by whining Ubuntu n00bs. You see, whenever a n00b is using Ubuntu and suddenly comes across a problem, assuming he knows anything about IRC, instead of actually trying to find out how to fix it himself he heads straight for #ubuntu, like a child running into his parents' room after a bad dream. Because of this, #ubuntu is kept at 800 whiny losers bitching and moaning until some Ubuntu pro comes along and fixes one of their problems, at which point they might say [[kthxbi]], or they might just say thx before continuing to flood with a different question.  Even so, #ubuntu takes an even more hard-line stance against trolling than the rest of freenode, understanding that anything that happens in #ubuntu will reflect badly upon the Ubuntu distribution.  [[Advice]] is always welcome, especially if it ends up causing some useless idiot to go back to Windows.

If you need codecs or to know how to turn your volume down, #ubuntu is the place for you. If you have a serious problem or found a bug, file a Launchpad about it where it will be promptly [[kline|killed]] and [[you|forgotten about]].

==The Homosexual Connection==
While [[apple|Macs]] used to be the computing system of choice for [[homosexuals]] everywhere, Ubuntu has recently taken over that niche, drawing [[over 9000|numerous]] former Mac fags into the Lunix community, and the Ubuntu IRC.  There is no one reason for this, but Ubuntu was built from the ground up with a conscious effort towards ending heterosexuality in operating systems, starting with a [[feces|pleasing brown]] theme reminding homosexual users of [[buttsex]].  There used to be an Ubuntu social networking site at gaybuntu.com.

== Ubuntu Derivatives ==
There are also some derivative distributions which are based on Ubuntu which are intended to solve other problems than giving niggers a pleasing computing experience, such as:

* Kubuntu, a distribution for [[fags]] who, for some reason, think KDE's [[goatse|Windows 95-esque interface]] is appealing.
* Xubuntu, a distribution for people with shitty computers that don't have the 24GB of DDR3-1600 SDRAM required to run GNOME
* Edubuntu, a distribution for classrooms, with the goal of turning your children into [[faggots]].
* Ubuntu Studio, an Ubuntu version with lots of Audio and Video editing tools, but without any drivers for sound and video cards, so its fucking useless as shit and nobody uses it.
* Ubuntu [[Christian]] Edition, a distribution which focuses on chatrooms. This helps to get in contact with little children, with the intention of [[Michael Jackson|raping]] them.
* Ubuntu [[Muslim]] Edition, to attract the majority of Africans in countries where they are not currently eating one another.
* Lunix Mint, a standard Ubuntu derivative with a few key differences - proprietary audio and video codecs are installed by default, extra "mint" tools included to make [[Holocaust|certain tasks]] easier, it has a minty-fresh desktop theme and Jews aren't allowed to use it.  [http://Linuxminthatesjews.pastebin.com/f50e0d4a7 Seriously.]
* [[Cancer|Ubuntu Furry Remix]].  That's right, Ubuntu [[Furry]] [[Rap|Remix]] is a [[Fail|complete]] Ubuntu-based operating system, created for [[Perverts|furries]] by <s>furries</s> a lone basement dweller named Sergey Davidoff.

<!-- This is outdated, but not entirely unfunny shit. I'm just going to comment it out so some of it can be reused in new sections.

== Goatse Gibbon ==
The previous Ubuntu distribution was called 7.10, which means it it was the 10th time the Ubuntu developers added to the Ubuntu API after breaking compatibility with the Ubuntu 6 series.  It came with numerous improvements, including breaking people's computers only a mere six months after the last upgrade.

== The Hairy Hardon ==
The <s>current</s> following Ubuntu release from [[At least 100]] years ago is codenamed Hairy Hardon, a pun on the fact that it is a long-term support release- [[Last Thursday]], Jono Bacon [https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2007-August/000336.html announced] that the [[Porn|security team]] would make sure that Ubuntu remains [[Masturbation|extra hard]] for 3 years!
-->

== Ubuntu Releases ==
[[File:Ubuntu linux wutmaster.jpg|thumb|This is the cock all the Ubuntufags suck.]]
Because [[retards|Ubuntards]] wanted to make it look like Ubuntu is actually getting better between each release, the version numbers are in the format of the year Ubuntu was released followed by a numerical representation of the month. A new Ubuntu is released every 6 months, which makes users update to the newest version very often. This usually results in broken systems, and Ubuntu fags [[BAWWWWW|BAWWWWWing]] on the Ubuntu forums. Also, Ubuntu is known for having retarded names that include the name of an animal. This is to make the operating system appeal to [[furries]].

<!-- These names need replaced with something funny. -->
