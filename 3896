ITT Tech
[[Image:Couch_potato.jpg|thumb|250px|Typical ITT Tech grad.]]

'''[[ITT]] Technical Institute''' is a fictional college invented by the telemarketing and infomercial specialists of the world. Designed to [[Ass rape|ass-rape]] both your wallet and your credit score in exchange for a dumbed-down education that is worth absolutely nothing, it is home to mostly [[Failure|dumbasses]] that were not accepted to real colleges, and were too stupid to realize that community colleges offer degrees that are actually worth a shit for far less money.  ITT, for those who don't know, was once International Telephone and Telegraph, a phone company.  Now it is the world's largest supplier of pumps, the ones that move liquids, not the shoes.  It is also a major defense contractor, which is another reason to hate it.

This is because graduating from ITT Tech is roughly equivalent to getting a GED, and the student body clearly reflects this. Attempting to transfer credits to a real college is a sure-fire recipe for [[lulz]]; though only the admissions office at said college will be enjoying it, due to ITT Tech being an unaccredited institution. ITT Tech has been shown to be nothing more than a pretend college that is marketed towards the self-righteous and arrogant [[retards]] that are [[Fucktard|gullible]] enough to fall for pyramid schemes. This could create tsunamis of lulz, as borrowing $40,000 from [[Jews|loan-sharks]] to pay for an education any back-alley night school can provide is what should be (but sadly isn't) enough to create [[an heroes]] en masse.

The so-called ''students'' that attend this phony college are usually looking to learn more about computers or graphic design. What they inevitably find is a Florida-style operation that a [[Sibe|poorly-trained dog]] could tell was shady, and emerge with a [[Bullshit|degree]] and 3D modeling skills which are sub-par to [[13 year old boys|middle school students]] with [[Warez|pirated copies]] of Maya.

The so-called ''instructors'' are classic examples of [[Renetto|incompetence]]. Mostly living in economy apartments and driving Honda Accords and shitty pick-up trucks on their meager salary (which they hardly earn), they are not exactly motivated to do their jobs properly. This is just one factor in the utter uselessness of ITT Tech. Covering only the bare minimum on each subject, the instructors have been known to gloss over any legitimate questions with a polite diversionary remark. They are unfailingly polite because they are invariably [[China|Chinese]], and likely to be named Mr. Cheng. Barely speaking English, they are just one more reason to deport the fucking immigrants that are taking our jobs.

On the hierarchy of education, ITT Tech is one step above beautician college, but below [[Computer Science III]]. In fact it's a mystery why they <i>don't</i> take [[Computer Science III]], because every county in the United States has a fully accredited, and cheap, Community College.

==Job Placement==
Making a guarantee that contains as much truth as [[Missouri]] contains [[Winnar|win]], ITT Tech promises job-placement for [[you|their graduates]]. Much like their facade of being an actual institute of higher learning, this is nothing more than a scam to [[cake|sweeten]] the [[bait]] for unsuspecting suckers.

The best job placement goes to those that graduate at the top of their class, which isn't that hard considering the [[down syndrome|competition]]. Job placement from ITT Tech usually amounts to an entry-level tech support position (for those lucky enough to be overqualified for telemarketing). However, this is not entirely bad, as attested by this [[Failure|satisfied customer]];

{{quote|I used to flip burgers. Now I earn $20,000 a year and probably will for the rest of my life. Thanks ITT Tech!|ITT Graduate, [[hookers and blow|totally rolling in it]]}}

Planning to [[ejaculate|aim a little higher]] than entry-level tech support? This may pose a problem, given that you will be laughed out of every job interview you are extraordinarily lucky to be given. This is mainly due to the fact that you just wasted 18 months (and countless years of the future repaying student loans) receiving a retarded skill set in your chosen field of profession.

ITT Technical Institute is just one of many failures, providing nothing more than a false sense of identity and a watered-down education. There are literally hundreds of schools just like ITT Tech, but do not be fooled, because they are all operated under the same [[WTC|global Zionist conspiracy]]. Chances are that if you go to ITT Tech, your AA in [[shit nobody cares about|your chosen field of profession]] will lead to a job as a floor associate at [[advertising|Best Buy]], or in the case that you are a [[bitch|woman]], a fall-back job as a stripper (assuming that you're not a [[man_the_harpoons|whale]]).

==Courses==
You too can ''technically'' graduate with an AA degree (getting an AS requires at least a pulse, so it isn't offered). You will get [[buttsecks|hands-on experience]] with engaging subject matter in the following courses:

*[[blog|Blogging 101]] using Wordpress.com
*How to stop your HTML from being displayed
*Right-click on Microsoft Word<!-- ITS "ON" NOT "IN" -->
*[[How is babby formed?|How is babby formed? How girl get pragnent?]]
<!-- leave this alone -->

==Advanced Courses==
Graduating with an AA not good enough? How about a '''BA''' that's worth pretty much the same thing? The weak are usually weeded out in the beginning, but [[Aspies|the smarter lot]] move on to more advanced topics such as:

*Pre-Algebra II
*Accelerated Introduction to Microsoft Paint
*HTML tables in Microsoft Frontpage
*Word Processing 101
*Computer: What is it?

==ZOMG MAEK VIDEO GAMEZ==

What does every [[basement dweller]] dream of? That's right, playing [[Online_sex_games|video games]] as a job. It's [[????|easy]]! Just graduate from a technical college and '''YOUR FUCKING JOB''' will be to sit around and play video games all day!
