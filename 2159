'''DEFCON''' is the worlds largest [[h4x0r]] convention, held annually in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Every year, [[script kiddie]]s gather to pretend there is a [[1337]] underground ring of [[fag|hacktivists]], just like in [[Wikipedia:Hackers_(film)|that one movie with Angelina Jolie]].

In reality, the size of the convention is its biggest downfall. The fact is, [[hardcore|real hackers]] don't go to huge conventions; real hackers stay where they belong, [[basement dweller|the basement]]. There have been <i>some</i> [[lulz|lulz-worthy]] moments, though, and you can always count on delicious [[drama]] when you fill a hotel with angsty teenagers with identity problems.

==Usual Activities at DEFCON==
Among many of the [[irony|intelectually]] charged events at DEFCON, some include:

*Speeches, given to auditoriums filled with [[obese]], [[acne|pimply]] [[teenager]]s who breathe mainly through their mouths. The nature of these lectures usually consists of elitist reflections on [[nerd|'Hacker Culture']] and pointless 'How-To's. 

*Competitions, in which contestants attempt to [[pwn]] each other by creating "viruses" in command prompt. Usually the winner is a cunning little shit who [[cheat|thought outside the box]], surprising everyone with their [[attention whore|stunning intellect.]] 

*Eating. [[Fat|A lot of eating goes on here]]; cold [[pizza]] and milkshakes are favoured.

*Messing with stuff you aren't really supposed to, like the slot machines. This is dangerous, especially considering that casinos tend to actually take security [[Mafia|a little more seriously]] than most hotels.

== DEFCON Pwns Reporter In 2007 ==
Normally the convention is as dull as a shoe-box full of wood chips; but in 2007 DEFCON organizers were tipped off by some geek in NBC's IT department that [[Michelle Madigan]], a reporter from Dateline, would be spying on them for a hit piece.  

DEFCON organizers offered Madigan several opportunities to get a press pass â€” but the dumb bitch insisted on staying "under-cover". So, they outed her in front of the entire convention.

Lulz quickly ensued:

If you listen closely at 1:22 you can hear retarded sheep beginning to cluster together. Like a shitball.
