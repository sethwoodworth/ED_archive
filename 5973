Old [[people]], or irl-Oldfags, are anyone over the age of [[Trollface|twenty five]]. Old people can remember loads of stuff from the past and won't hesitate to lecture you endlessly about shit you already knew or didn't care to know in the first place. At least they say they can remember, but it's possible they're just making [[shit]] up. All old people fought in [[World War II]], and so [[Hitler]] impressions provide immediate [[lulz]] when in their presence. Some go down the dark path of the Red Hat Cult. 

It is a well known [[fact]] that [[Catholic|all old men]] and [[Grandma|most old women]] are [[pedophiles]]. Proof: Groups like the AARP are run by [[Jews]] and pedophiles and have [[Some argue|long argued]] that [[poor]] [[welfare|pensioners]] should be allowed to order low-priced [[drugs]] - i.e. Viagra and Cialis for use in [[raping]] [[children]] - from [[Canada]].

The word ''old'' refers to something that has either happened [[at least 100 years ago]] or never happened at all (like the [[holocaust]]). Alternatives to using the word old is olde or Aulde. These are commonly used by [[Goth]](Emo) kids, [[elitist]] [[faggot]]s and pseudo-[[intellectual]]s.

==You are now old.==
 
Let's face it. If you weren't born in the 90s you are now riding the fence towards the other side of young. The [[fag|young adults]] today don't like the [[80s]], started playing [[video games|vidya]] with the [[Nintendo|Nintendo 64]], get nostalgic over [[shit|Korn]] and think [[furry|Pokemon]] is the greatest show of all time. Didn't think this would happen to you, huh? Luckily, there are many [[an hero|techniques available to ease you into the transition of becoming increasingly decrepit and irrelevant]].

==Nursing Homes==

They are [[prison|establishments of solace, comfort and hospitality]] that old people are thrown into against their will by their families when they put a burden on their budget from their huge consumption of Depends and ginger snaps. They are forced to live in a small room which reeks of [[shit|fecal matter]], piss, Lysol disinfectant and pus-oozing bedsores (the smell is worse on the Alzheimer's unit) at a comfortable temperature of 115 degrees Fahrenheit. They are given half-assed treatment by nurses that consist of [[niggers]] and [[fat]] [[white trash]] who wear their hair in a bun so tight it practically scalps them. They are forced to eat a concoction for all meals most likely consisting of the mashed-up corpses of past residents who have died. Bingo is the main form of entertainment in these places, though half of all participants end up dozing off or kicking the bucket during the game. Popular TV shows in nursing homes include ''The Golden Girls'', ''Wheel of Fortune'', ''Jeopardy!'' and ''The Price Is Right''. Visitors consist of the residents' trashy and abusive families telling them the place is lovely when they really know it's a fucking dump. Their grandkids would typically sneak off and play Connect the Dots with the bald guys' liver spots.
