{{lj|user=malerymalamute}} is a disgusting [[furry]] dogfucker and the subject of a lolz-fest on {{ljcomm|user=fursecution}} back in 2006.

On August 29, 2006, {{lj|user=erlkonigvinz}} was surfing around [[pounced dot org|Pounced.org]] only to discover a frightening (but typical) [[furry]] personal ad belonging to '''Malery Malamute'''.

A few hours later, a fight broke out on {{ljcomm|user=fursecution}} when Malery was tipped off to an entry made about her. The original complaint was that she didn't make a lot of sense, but as with all furry discussions, the topic quickly turned to dog fucking.

Things turned even more sour when [[ashi moto]] made the announcement that Malery was an obvious [[troll]]. Fingers flew: Rooterhusky, Julius Flint, and a number of others were accused of being Malery. Furries turned against other furries, trolls against other trolls.

Ashi moto later retracted her theory that Malery was a troll. Some claim to know her [[IRL]], some hang onto the troll idea, and few know the [[truth]].

On September 1, 2006, 11 PM EST there were three posts to Malery's LJ, totaling 164 comments; four posts on {{ljcomm|user=fursecution}} with 530 comments; and one post to [[drama_awesome]] with 61 comments. (That's 755 in all) Quite a few people have saved numerous copies and screenshots.

If Malery was indeed a troll, her [[lulz]] meter will remain at 11 for a long, long time.
