'''George Gideon Oliver Osborne Esq.''' is the Heir Apparent to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Baronets Osborne baronetcy] of Ballygaylord, County Tipperary, Ireland, and this makes him one of what is known in [[Ireland]]  as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Ascendancy the Ascendancy], the old Anglo-Irish [[The Royal Family|aristocracy]]. Originally named [[Bible|Gideon]], he changed his name to George when he was 13 due to his admiration for [[Hitler|George Michael]]. Whilst at Oxford, Osborne and [[David Cameron|David "Dave" Cameron]] (see Note 1 below) were members of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullingdon_Club the Bullingdon Club], a notorious Oxford University dining club, it was 'infamous' for 'public buggery' and was open only to the homosexual sons of aristocratic families and the super-rich. In October 2008, gay financier Nathaniel "pink pounds" Rothschild claimed that Gideon had tried to solicit a more than £9,000 "gift" from his lover the Russian aluminium magnate [[Putin|Oleg Deripaska]], by threatening to make public that only [[transexual|transition]] metals can be magnetic.

''Note 1 - Inserted by request of the [[Internet Law]]yer;  Dave Cameron is no more [[gay]] than he is a [[coke]]head, and never lets anything fun to enter his [[ass|orifices]]. He's an ordinary family man who drinks [[sperm|bitter]] and favours the missionary position with his [[13 year old boy|wife]].''

At the age of 14 by the miracle of transubstantiation Gideon became the Shadow Chancellor, the British equivalent of a [[Doctor Who|Dark Lord of the Sith]], and took the new name Squeaky George. He immediately appealed to the [[retard|Daily Mail readership]] with his [[oral]] style, using words like "sums" and "adding" and rhetorical flourishes like "oh no they didn't" and "he's behind you!"  and "I could crush a grape" (see Note 2) when attacking Gordon Brown. Gideon leads the weekly "hissing and pouting" during Prime Minister's question time and is the only member of [[Queen|Her Majesty]]'s Opposition to satisfy the [[rape|sexual predations]] of His Infernal Majesty Peter Mandelsohn, a [[pubic|pube]]-free [[Saddam|Saddam Hussain]] to Satan's ...  well, [[South Park|Satan]]. His [[cartman|authority]] and [[anal|gravitas]] on the economy was thought so majesterial that the Tories brought back one of their previous Chancellors, [[GTA|Fat Tony]], to try and make Gideon sound less like a squeaking, lisping little [[twat]].
