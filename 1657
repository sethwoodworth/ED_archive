'''''[http://c0coa-the-clown.livejournal.com/ Cocoa the Clown]''''' is a [[graphic]] [[webcomic]] created by [[Saint Amaimon]]. The comic is based on a [[homeless|vagrant]] clown who wanders through the back alleys of [[New York|a city engulfed by urban decay]]; [[OM NOM NOM NOM|eating trash]] and pondering his [[homosexual|inner desires]]. He delivers his dissociative passages through three panel tales that read as though they were [[LJ|journal entries]] of a [[schizophrenic]]. 

Cocoa's creator, [http://saint-amaimon.livejournal.com/ Saint_Amaimon] (Aka:Ama) is a daycare worker in Portland, Oregon. He infrequently airs the ''Cocoa The Clown Show'' Saturday mornings on his LJ, and through MySpace blogs. He's currently working on a zine of the same name.

In early July, St. Amaimon began promoting his humble little clown in [[webcomic]] communities around LiveJournal. With subjects that involved the defilement of corpses and animal mutilation, hardly unforeseen was the shit-storm that arose - resulting in his subsequent ban from the majority of said communities.

{{ljcomm|user=webcomics}}, in particular, is a community who's main function is to peddle [[furry]] porn to 14 year olds, and indulge grown gamer-faggots with comics that contain video game in-jokes. 

Seeing that no LJ-Cut had been used, the community regulars quickly flooded the post with "constructive criticism" calling Ama's creation tired and contrived. 

After refusing to put his work behind a cut and accusing the [[mods]] of "hating art", the [[banhammer]] was brought down. 

A few days later, St. Amaimon went on to {{ljcomm|user=minicomics}} where he bragged about being banned from  {{ljcomm|user=webcomics}}; claiming [http://community.livejournal.com/minicomics/148697.html#comments the ban was a result of "being the best artist there".] This time he used an LJ cut for his post, but the reaction was just as negative. Upon being asked to back up his bold statement of being the best artist in {{ljcomm|user=webcomics}}, Ama proudly displayed a [http://community.livejournal.com/minicomics/148697.html?thread=311001#t311001 certificate presented by Jesus Christ himself] as the proof behind his declaration.
 
Eventually, someone ran back to webcomics to [http://community.livejournal.com/webcomics/393224.html report the dramatic happenings and ask "OMG Wtf is this guys prbm?"]

Anyone who defended St. Amaimon was [http://community.livejournal.com/webcomics/393224.html?thread=1242632#t1242632 blindly accused of being one of his troll journals.] Seven people died.  

St. Amaimon, is still banned from the majority of webcomic communities on [[LJ]], however his creation has continued to find itself on these communities in different incarnations from time to time.
