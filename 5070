Directly after the MONGO1 account was banned a new account arose, using the name "Ed Poor", potentialy impersonation. [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Special:Contributions/Ed_Poor contributions] that did more vandalism and personal attacks. This one used AOL IPs 205.188.116.196, 205.188.117.70, 205.188.117.74.

Ed Poor states it was not him. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEd_Poor&diff=64466312&oldid=64387571]

MONGO and Tony Sidaway removed the results -- In general psychology (from wikipedia's articles), if someone was innocent they would want it to stand as evidence whereas a guilty person would want to hide it: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&curid=1975039&diff=64414695&oldid=64413700 (example)] all mention of it and banned the account for eternity that said it.

MONGO hides the cox.net IP and claims it was only AOL. Is it because the cox.net IP is his?:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jaranda&diff=prev&oldid=64423313]

MONGO deletes the user and user talk page of someone mentioning this and MONGO makes personal attacks in the summary of why he deleted them:

MONGO tells someone to post to Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents, however he has reverted complaints about him there (see above):
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&diff=prev&oldid=64427147]

MONGO says, "well the sight is supportive of calling African-Americans (and blcaks in general) by the "N" word...so if there was an article that used that word on the mainpage, that would not be worth linking to either.":
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&diff=prev&oldid=64431937]

When asked if MONGO would spend the "spend the same amount of time and energy on that article" (being GNAA article), MONGO said:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&diff=prev&oldid=64437013]


MONGO deletes an image instead of reverted a changed version of it:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=MONGO&page=Image%3AEncyclopaedia+Dramatica+front+page.PNG]


MONGO vandalizes the article again by removing the external link to the site:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&diff=prev&oldid=64509881]

MONGO removes links that quote his wiki edits in talk pages:

205.188.116.196, 205.188.117.70, 205.188.117.74.

Ed Poor states it was not him.

MONGO and Tony Sidaway removed the results -- In general psychology 
(from wikipedia's articles), if someone was innocent they would want it 
to stand as evidence whereas a guilty person would want to hide it: 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&curid=1975039&diff=64414695&oldid=64413700 (example)] 
all mention of it and banned the account for eternity that said it.  
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&diff=prev&oldid=64414908 MONGO 
protects the talk page where it was first mentioned.] 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&diff=prev&oldid=64419489 Tony 
Sidaway also hides the IP results]

Another admin wishes to investigate this and MONGO reverts that admin 
twice:

MONGO hides the cox.net IP and claims it was only AOL.  Is it because 
the cox.net IP is his?:

MONGO deletes the user and user talk page of someone mentioning this 
and MONGO makes personal attacks in the summary of why he deleted them:
 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=MONGO&page=User%3ARptng03509345]
 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=MONGO&page=User%3ARptng03509345]


MONGO tells someone to post to Wikipedia:Administrators' 
noticeboard/Incidents, however he has reverted complaints about him there (see 
above):

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&diff=prev&oldid=64427147]

MONGO says, "well the sight is supportive of calling 
African-Americans (and blcaks in general) by the "N" word...so if there was an article 
that used that word on the mainpage, that would not be worth linking to 
either.":
 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&diff=prev&oldid=64431937]

When asked if MONGO would spend the "spend the same amount of time 
and energy on that article" (being GNAA article), MONGO said:
 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&diff=prev&oldid=64437013]


MONGO deletes an image instead of reverted a changed version of it:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=MONGO&page=Image%3AEncyclopaedia+Dramatica+front+page.PNG]


MONGO vandalizes the article again by removing the external link to 
the site:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&diff=prev&oldid=64509881]

MONGO removes links that quote his wiki edits in talk pages:

Other actions by MONGO:
* "''Ah, I am not aware of them or their activities. I have worked 
very hard in the past to protect many wikipedians from off-wiki 
harassment by those that have posted at wikipediareview and hivemind. I can't be

stuff.--MONGO 08:34, 18 July 2006 (UTC)''"  Guess what? He banned the person 
who helped him out.

and not GNAA, MONGO blanks the talk page, moving discussions from 
minutes ago into an archive so the entire talk page is blank.

 Note troll is used as a personal attack. See [[WP:NPA]].  MONGO also 
uses the word retarded both for a personal attack on a user (first one 
in list below as well as for a website)
