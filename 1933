23:13 < wattage> Greetings.
23:13 < Cyndre> hi
23:15 < Cyndre> so why was I supposed to join here
23:19 <@yirimyah> if you have a problem
23:19 <@yirimyah> this is where you complain
23:19 <@yirimyah> usually for big major thingies with like 10 ops
23:20 <@yirimyah> however, i would rather deal with this here.
23:20 <@yirimyah> what is your problem?
23:22 < Cyndre> I just want my pic and name removed
23:22 < Cyndre> thats all
23:23 < Cyndre> tell them I cant talk in the other channel
23:23 < Cyndre> lol

23:27 < Cyndre> thanks
23:27 <@RamadanBunny> i still wan to know why someone made an article about u
23:28 <@RamadanBunny> *want
23:28 <@RamadanBunny> what did u do to them?
23:28 < Cyndre> I run a free online gaming server with about 30,000 active 
                players
23:28 < Cyndre> doesnt take much
23:29 < Cyndre> more then likely it was just someone that was banned from the 
                game
23:30 < Cyndre> so when will it be completly removed
23:30 <@RamadanBunny> how come you didn't just ask nicely like "hey guys, 
                      someone made this, can you take my real name out and the 
                      pic down?"
23:30 < Cyndre> so when will it be completly removed
23:30 <@RamadanBunny> how come you didn't just ask nicely like "hey guys, 
		      someone made this, can you take my real name out and the 
		      pic down?"
23:31 <@RamadanBunny> why with all the "imma chargin my suer!"
23:31 < Cyndre> we did
23:31 <@RamadanBunny> who did u ask?
23:32 < Cyndre> [21:42] <MystForm> could someone please remove that page from 
				   the website?
23:32 < Cyndre> [21:42] <+Bananaramadan> no, bitch
23:32 < Cyndre> [21:42] <+Bananaramadan> go fuck a tree
23:32 < Cyndre> in main channel
23:33 < Cyndre> and why the Im going to sue for slander and privacy invasion?  
                Because it gets results.
23:33 <@RamadanBunny> lol
23:33 <@RamadanBunny> not rly
23:33 <@RamadanBunny> not here
23:33 < Cyndre> The worst that would have happened is it cost me some money, 
                but you would have put my article on the front page giving me 
                publicity, it would have been in the papers giving us both 
                publicity
23:33 < Cyndre> its a win win situation for me
23:33 <@RamadanBunny> except we laugh more.
23:34 <@RamadanBunny> ur article wouldn't make the front page.
23:34 <@RamadanBunny> it's lame
23:34 < Cyndre> ahhh
23:34 < Cyndre> but we both tried asking politly
23:34 <@RamadanBunny> srsly, the only reason its still there at this point is 
                      because you threw such a hissy
23:34 < Cyndre> throwing a hissy is way different then comming in and asking 
                politly
23:35 <@RamadanBunny> um
23:35 <@RamadanBunny> what u did was the equivilent of someone on ur server 
                      asking another user to do something and then getting 
                      psycho when some totally random user told them to fuck off
23:35 < Cyndre> it costs me $ 50 to file a small claim for $ 5000 in punitive 
                damages for slander
23:35 <@RamadanBunny> so?
23:36 <@yirimyah> Cyndre, if you had said can someone take it down, it is shit, 
                  THAT would have got results
23:36 < Cyndre> no, what I did was ask for something slanderous and deflamatory 
                to be removed from me
23:36 <@yirimyah> this is only going to make this article interesting
23:36 < Cyndre> we did yirmyah
23:36 <@RamadanBunny> srsly. you came into an IRC channel
23:36 <@RamadanBunny> AND ASKED RANDOM USERS
23:36 < Cyndre> no, we asked in main chat
23:36 <@RamadanBunny> http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Special:Listusers/sysop
23:36 < Cyndre> for help
23:36 < Cyndre> we didnt pm random users for help
23:37 <@RamadanBunny> so?
23:37 <@yirimyah> there is a fuckload of articles on ED that are shit and short 
                  and only ONLY exist because there is drama related to them.
23:37 <@RamadanBunny> lol
23:37 <@yirimyah> This may well be the best possible way to ensure that the 
                  article is never taken down.
23:37 <@RamadanBunny> hahaha
23:37 < Cyndre> then it would leave me no option
23:38 <@RamadanBunny> ilu yirimyah 
23:38 <@RamadanBunny> lawl
23:38 < Cyndre> Im not some little pissant person that you guys walk all over 
                daily
23:38 <@RamadanBunny> yirimyah: doesn't he need to go to legal now?
23:40 < Cyndre> and just to let you know I was in a house fire when I was 5
23:40 < Cyndre> 5 months old, and thats where the scars are from
23:41 <@RamadanBunny> When a user brings up legal issues, it can no longer be 
                      handled on wiki. You will need to email legal @ encyclopediadramatica.com
23:41 <@RamadanBunny> per girlvinyl's talk page
23:42 < Cyndre> so you guys refuse to remove it and end this here?
23:42 <@RamadanBunny> lawl
23:42 <@RamadanBunny> i'm not a sysop u moron

23:48 <@tfo> cyndre: why remove the photo/article?
23:49 <@tfo> i understand the real name, and that's policy
23:49 <@RamadanBunny> If he really wants, I can obscure his face in the photo.
23:49 <@RamadanBunny> =D
23:49 < Cyndre> because I feel that its deflamatory towards my person and having a picture of me that I didnt post is privacy invasion, because we never posted that picture on the net

00:59 < Cyndre> oh, so you will send a laywer upto my home town to meet me in court?\
00:59 <@yirimyah> Cyndre: I estimate the chance of a real lawsuit at less than )%.
00:59 <@yirimyah> *0 %
01:00 <@yirimyah> If you were going to sue us you would sue us.
01:00 <@yirimyah> if you were not, you would bluster and talk shit.
01:00 <@yirimyah> The latter is the reality.
01:00 < infernocanuck> The can't afford a lawyer.  They'll send me.  Get out the fine China
01:01 <@yirimyah> oh, and: DEFAMATORY, NOT DEFLAMATORY

01:06 <@yirimyah> Well, have fun trying to make this stick.
01:06 <@yirimyah> With the whole "no jurisdiction" thing.

01:16 < infernocanuck> You're right, poor young Cyndre has carpal tunnel.
01:16 < Cyndre> A. WHO IS LIABLE FOR LIBEL ON THE INTERNET? 
01:16 < Cyndre> In traditional libel law, generally speaking, every participant in the communication is liable 
                (subject to the defence of innocent dissemination).  So, for example, if a person SAT composes a 
                defamatory letter, and a person SBT types and mails it, they are both liable for its consequences.

01:17 < Cyndre> In contrast to the American approach, an ISP in the 1999 English High Court case of 
                Godfrey v. Demon Internet Ltd. was found liable in defamation after failing to remove defamatory 
                remarks in a posting to a Newsgroup forum following a request to do so by the plaintiff who was 
                alleged to have been the author of the posting.  The comments in the posting were obscene and
                defamatory of the plaintiff and he denied being the author.  He therefor
01:17 < Cyndre> 1(1) In defamation proceedings a person has a defence if he shows that - 
01:17 < Cyndre> (a) he was not the author, editor or publisher of the statement complained of, 
01:17 < Cyndre> (b) he took reasonable care in relation to its publication, and 
01:17 < Cyndre> (c) he did not know, and had no reason to believe, that what he did caused or contributed to the 
                publication of a defamatory statement.
01:17 < Cyndre> While the Court concluded that the defendant company was not a SpublisherT as defined in the Act it 
                concluded that the company did nothing once it was notified of the allegedly defamatory nature of the 
                posting it could not rely on the defence.

02:22 < wattage> Josph, this is Adam Domoney again. I'm really getting pissed at you you son of a bitch. That website Encyclopedia Dramatica, who the hell you think it is that put there on my type of website when I sign in, pornographic images of some woman getting fucked in the ass, when you are the administrator and I am the guy that just got banned by you you motherfuck for trying to change over an article that I did not give you authority to use my name, I did not give you guys authority to take my copyrighted material, and I did not give you authority to quote things I never said. Now take the damn article down immediately or ? swear to god I will come up to your fricken school, I will meet with your administrators, and let people know exactly who and what's behind you and your little system administration. I'm pissed dude, take the article down. My number: 780-679-0302. You don't think I'm pissed? Just listen to the voice, guy. I'm not interested in you guys and your little cute little jokes about how you're gonna spam and record people, and literally fricken harass them on your site and then throw up your pornographic images when they try and go and edit out false information. Now take the damn page down now dude, or else I'm literally gonna meet with you people, personally ? what you're doing. Fine! Now take it down.
