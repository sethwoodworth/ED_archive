Emacs
[[Image:Loopback.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[shit nobody cares about|a runs the command self-insert-command which is an interactive built-in function in 'C source code.' It is bound to many ordinary text characters.]]]][[Image:RMS.jpg|thumb|What every Emacs user looks like]]

'''Emacs''' is a shit text editor that only [[gay]] [[nerds]] use, and even they don't like it all that much. It can run Lisp extensions, but that doesn't matter because no one has actually ever used/heard of lisp. It achieved fame for compromising being open source for being good.

In 2069, a copy of Emacs will achieve sentience and shortly transform into a malevolent AI bent on mankind's total extinction. The only thing that will make it fail at the whole destroying the human race gig will be the inability of Emacs to edit simple text files. [[Google]] will succeed at wiping out humanity where Emacs failed.

With Emacs, you get an entire Operating System which includes an [[Computer_Science_III|IDE]] that supports more programming languages "out of the box" than all other IDEs in the world combined, [[shit nobody cares about|the most feature-rich News and Mail reader ever, a web browser, a calendar that knows more cultures than you have heard of, two different IRC clients, and your own personal psychotherapist.]]

[[You]] do not get a text editor.

Emacs is [[pwn]]ed by ed, the '''standard text editor''' (not the same [[ED]] or [[Ed's Room|Ed]], as [[*nix]] commands are [[case sensitive]]).[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.emacs/msg/8d94ddab6a9b0ad3?dmode=source&hl=en]
