In the world of [[Internet drama]], some people comment on [[LiveJournal]] anonymously to protect themselves from the possible consequences of their statements, such as [[defriend]]ing or [[troll]]ing. Almost universally, they are complete pussies who contribute nothing to a conversation but act like their shit doesn't stink.



While some '''anonymous pussies''' are suspended users or others who lack [[LiveJournal]] accounts (and are too smart to create one), the default assumption is that an anonymous comment is being made by a person with an account.

Anonymous pussies often use [[dubious disclaimer]]s such as "[[No offense, but...]]"

'''Anonymous pussy''' (aka "discretion") is the only reason people use [[Craigslist]]
