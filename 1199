'''Brute Forcing''' is a method of cracking passwords that involves rotating through [[over 9000]] randomized strings until the correct one is discovered.  There are two forms of brute force attacks: one is dictionary style, where many pre-made strings are tried, while the other creates random strings from numbers and/or integers.  The former is faster, but does not always work, while the latter is [[Slowpoke]] but will eventually get it.

Note: All brute force attacks are logged and can get you v&/b&, so if you are going to brute, be sure that:

* The admins never check logs.
* The server is on some poorly managed shitty shared host.
* You do it during a time of the day when traffic is high (for high traffic addresses.)
* You do it during a DDoS attack (when admins won't be able to tell what the fuck is happening.)

==Wordlists/Dictionaries==
A file that contains a large number of words. Used for brute forcing passwords. Normally in a .txt format or some other easily readable and editable format.

This RAR file contains another RAR, which contains 43 text files.  Each one contains [[over 9000|100,000,000 lines of words; that's 4,300,000,000 (4.3 billion) combinations]].

I included a merge script for those who are disabled and can't [[cat]]. Just go to the /mergeLinks/ directory and ./merge.sh<br />
It will also delete the original (un-merged) files.

You will need approximately 30 gigabytes of free space to extract this.
