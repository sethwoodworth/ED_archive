Apart from being a versatile but unfunny herb, '''sage''' is a word originating from [[2chan]]. '''Sage''' (pronounced '''sah-gay''' by [[Wapanese]] faggots and '''sayj''' by everyone else) is used to reply to a post without [[bump]]ing it. It's done by putting it within the e-mail field and does not push the post to the top.

Since then, its been ported to all the other [[chan]]s. It is now used by [[/b/tard]]s primarily to express displeasure to the post being replied to. On [[4chan]], if you want to use sage for its original purpose, without [[360 Kid|showing everyone online that you did]], type "nokosage" in the email field.

The word itself comes from the [[Wapanese|Japanese]] word, [[Cool story, bro|「下げる」　"sageru", (sah-gay-roo) meaning, 'to lower.']] However, [[some argue]] that [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|nobody really gives a shit.]] Amen /b/rother!

== Myth ==
[[Retards|Many people]] have strange ideas about sage, which they got by believing what they heard on /b/ rather than going to page 14, saging a thread, and seeing for themselves.  For example:

* '''Sage doesn't work in [[/b/]].'''
: As of November 26, 2010, sage worked in [[/b/]], exactly like it says it does in the [[FAQ]].

* '''Sage only works in lowercase, otherwise you bump the thread.'''
: On 4chan, 'sage', 'Sage', 'SAGE', 'SaGe', and now even 'nokosage' keep you from bumping the thread if you put it in the email field.

* '''Sage makes a thread die sooner.'''
: Saging a thread does not make it die sooner, it only keeps you from bumping it, the same as if you had left the thread alone. Just because you didn't bump it doesn't mean someone else won't. The exception to this is '''sagebombing''':  When a thread reaches 300 replies, it can no longer be bumped.  Most threads never get anywhere near this limit, but with a small [[botnet]] or a long list of unbanned [[proxies]], you can sage a thread to 300 replies in a few minutes.  If you don't have a botnet, your best tactic is to break up the thread with a large amount of text, as shown below.  Note that until discussion in the thread has been killed, it is advantageous to '''not''' use sage, because it increases the time you have to wait between posts.

Another [[faggot|cool]] thing you can do with sage:
* Type sage inside the E-mail field.
* Arbitrarily put the ASCII null character inside the field. like s+(alt+0157)+a+(alt+0157)+g+e(alt+0157).
* Enjoy deceiving other people that you've saged a thread.
