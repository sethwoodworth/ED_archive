"Dragonguyver" is the internet identity of a [[sick fuck]] named Joshua Alan Beane. Dragonguyver can be considered a member of virtually every [[fandom]] on the internet. Dragonguyver has expressed interest in [[bestiality]], transexualism (he has maintained several [[LiveJournal]]s [http://www.livejournal.com/users/cuteliljenny/ from the female side of his personality]), [[fanfiction]], [[Roleplaying]], [[furries]], Magic: The Gathering, [[Pedophilia]], and [[Hentai]].

Dragonguyver commands [[internet|superficial]] knowledge of an impressively large [[faggotry|variety]] of subjects. His favorite is philosophy, especially philosophy derived from mainstream faux counter-culture movies like ''Fight Club'' and [[The Matrix]]. He is opposed to the United States Government, and tends to [[fap|complain]] about it in his [[Livejournal]].

Dragonguyver comes from humble beginnings. Much of his [[life story]] can be found in the lyrics to songs on his concept album "Struggle and Fall". His concept album was not a reality until scores of gallant muscians were commisioned by [[kthor]] to bring his dreams to [http://www.shortandhappy.com/dragonguyver fruition]. A few bands featured on this album were The [[Gay]] Abrahams, Don't Tell Mom I'm Gay, [[butthurt|Gay]] Battleship, and Alienjack. 

Dragonguyver once lived in his car, a fact that he is abnormally proud of. He is currently living in government-provided housing in Portland, Maine with his fiancee Robyn. Robyn met Dragonguyver over the internet when she was living in Michigan. He convinced her to move out of her parents and into a homeless shelter with him. The two butter beasts are currently jobless, but enjoy maintaining their web presence with a library computer. They also enjoy spending any money they "earn" on clove cigarettes so that they can fit in with their peers.
