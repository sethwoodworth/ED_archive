Advice Aeralik
{{WP80navsmall}}
[[Aeralik]] was a whiny ''[[EverQuest II]]'' developer who was known to have [[sex]] with players at conventions, e-[[castration|castrating]] every other class in the game, and calling everything gay. He quit in November 2009. This was an obnoxious [[EQ2Flames]] meme in early [[2009]] but doesn't show up anymore.


Posting '''Advice Aeralik''' in EQ2Flames these days ''will'' get you yelled at for posting an [[old meme]]. It's only time until Advice [[Smedley]] is hopefully <sub>not</sub> made.
