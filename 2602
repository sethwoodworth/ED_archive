'''Editthis.info''' (also known as editshit.info, shitedit.info, or ShitTide.info,) is a wiki hosting service that is [[n00b|newer]] and less famous than its competitor, [[Wikia]]. Unlike Wikia, which was started by renowned [[Britain|British]] hoe [[Angela Beesley]], this was started by a n00b named RobKohr.  Editthis.info is a "wiki within a wiki" (wikifarm) host, in which it simply makes new wikis act as pages and subcategories, meaning any [[sysop|global admin]] can [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]] without your consent, for any reason.  There are other [[MediaWiki]] wikifarms that allow you to make your own little retarded wikis for free. These include Referata and Wiki-site.

==Notable wikis==
*Code: Wiki, a wiki used only be emos, that thankfully has gotten thousands of vandal attacks.
*Dannypedia, the only wiki here that has any lulz.
*Alterealitiky, A wiki for kids. It's so clean and kid-friendly that I'd sure like to put a goatse picture there every once in a while.
*Conservatruth, which reveals the truth about [[Conservapedia]].
*[[Ultraviolet News Network]], [[retard]]s
