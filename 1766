'''Copypasta''' (or Copy pasta, or COPY PASTA) is text on [[*chans]] that gets copied and pasted over and over. This is how it works: someone posts something on [[b|/b/]] that riles people up. People see the topic and copy that first inflammatory post. Then a week or so later someone posts it again. Or they might post it a day later. Or a minute later. Whatever. The flamewar starts over again.

[[The best]] response to any copypasta: [[cool story bro]].

==Copypasta Endings==
Often copypasta will have endings resulting in various memes and lulz, as follows:

===Bel-Air===
This will end the copypasta with the famous theme song from [[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]. Often coming in at the 'and my mom got scared' part or has a character recite the whole thing.

===Reese's Puffs===
A time-tested classic.  This ending usually comes into play at the [[Cum|climax]] of a very troubling or exciting [[sex|situation]].  Rather than resolve the story, one of the characters will abruptly say something to the effect of "I had Reese's for breakfast."  At this point, the other character will completely forget about his/her worries and jump into the corresponding commercial dialogue, enamored by the peanut butter and chocolaty goodness that is Reese's Puffs cereal.  "It's Reese's... for breakfast!"

===Candle...guy===
This kind of ending is usually abrupt. Often they will consist of asking of a character named Jack where to put a candle. This is because it is rumored that if you say [[Candlejack|Candlejack's]] name, he will come to ste

==="That's the power of Pinesol!"===
A rarely used ending of a person being in a place with no or an odd clean smell. When they notice this, a [[fat|large]] black person [[whore|woman]] will reveal herself and shout "That's the power of Pinesol!"

===Thornberry'd===
This will end the copypasta with a line from the Wild Thornberrys: "And between you and me, something amazing happened... and now I can talk to animals! It's really cool, but totally secret. And you know what? Life's never been the same."

===The Game (You just lost it.)===
This ending requires a bit of pre-planning.  At the end of the copypasta one of the characters, usually a girl seducing one of the characters, will whisper to him "Read the first word of each paragraph". The Copypasta is written in such a way that the first word of every paragraph, when read in sequence, transcribes to "You just lost [[The Game]].

===Carry On Ending===
A [[Last Thursday|fairly recent]] entry which ends with a character, usually the narrator's father, telling the narrator to "carry on my wayward son...", followed by all of the lyrics to the song. Creates both [[lulz]] and [[Goatse|awesome]] owing to /b/'s established love of Kansas.

===Bear Ending===
Very trendy in copypasta is the bear ending, in which one of the characters transforms into a [[bear]] or reveals their true [[fursona|bear-identity]]. Will result in [[anti-lulz]] and [[rage]].

==Grammatical note==
''Copypasta'' is, of course, a '''noun.''' The '''verb''' for the posting of copypasta is ''[[cuntpaste]].''
