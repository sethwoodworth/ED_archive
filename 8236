The 1/2 Hour News Hour is a cance[[lol]]ed, racist, homophobic, and worst of all humorless half-hour television news propaganda show that reminded everyone why conservatives should never attempt comedy. Creator and future [[war]] criminal, Joel Surnow describes the show as " ..the anti-Jew Daily Show". Two pilot episodes have been taped, with the unlikely possibility of new shows being aired weekly. Cast and crew of the pilots include Kurt Long, Susan Yeagley, Manny Coto and Ned Rice. During the first show broadcast the hosts primarily mocked [[Barack Obama]], through jokes about his admitted teenaged drug-use, and parody of the [[Oprah|Oprah Winfrey]] magazine, [[I came|O]], entitled "BO", a totally edgy double entendre for body odor! 

On February 12th, The Half Hour News Hour aired a promo commercial on the Fox News channel, which ended up being autofreshed on [[YouTube]].com. Shown as a spoof "Public Service Announcement", the show warned that it may offend "The Left, The Far Left, Anyone Standing to the Left, Gay Penguins, Lawyers, The ACLU, Anyone With ACLU in Their Name, [[Democrat]]s, People Who Voted for Democrats, People Who Know Democrats, [[Gay]] Penguins, Illegal Aliens, Space Aliens, and [[Tom Cruise]]." ''It is unclear why the fuck "[[Gaiafag|gay penguins]]" was listed twice by [[Fox News]].''

The first (and probably only) episode featured a sketch in which [[Rush Limbaugh]] was the president and [[Mann Coulter]] the Vice President, because who wouldn't want a drug addict and a she-male running the country?  Commies, that's who!

Not only are they trying to rip off the Daily Show, but they failed to understand the "sense of humor" factor in such political satire shows. These shows are not biased to the left or to the right. The show usually just plays on how stupid politics are. They don't just make fun of people because they are on the "right" politically. It's just that usually most people on the right wing are just complete and utter douches. Ironically, 1/2 Hour News Hour proved that. lawl.  By the way did we mention that the show had canned laughter instead of a real audience?  This was most likely because no one would attend a taping of this show if you paid them to.

They also ripped the name off of the Canadian Political Comedy show "This Hour Has 22 Minutes", which is how long a half-hour show usually runs. At least the Canadian show had enough sense not to spell out that the "Hour" is a News Hour.
