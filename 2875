'''The Big Kahuna's Fat 30''' was a [[lulz]]y radio show hosted by ''The Big Kahuna'' on Sea FM/CFM in Australia, which was also broadcast on the [[internets]]. It existed to troll the hell out of everyone who called it. [[13 year old boy|Annoying tweenies]] regularly rang the show thinking it was ''teh lol'' only to be deemed [[unfunny]] and hung up on, often reducing them to tears. It was shut down by ''[[the man]]'' on a few occasions for [[defamation]] only to be returned in all its glory a few weeks later. 

==The Prize Pigs==
A dedicated group of teenagers who named themselves ''The Prize Pigs'' would spend 3 hours a night listening carefully to The Fat 30 waiting to hijack every prize on offer. Occasionally when a major prize was up for grabs these few people would be the only ones getting through on the phone lines, causing [[lulz]] for all involved. Some of the prizes were very expensive, such as $1,000 cash, which they spent on [[hookers and blow]], well, milkshakes and lollipops, they tended to be [[13 year old boys|13 years old]].

An ongoing competition on The Fat 30 was ''CD's of the week'' in which the topic and the two CD's given as prizes were changed every week. Each day about 3 people won this an of course, the Prize Pigs each won once a week, gathering themselves huge collections of CDs they didn't like/want.

==Net Night==

Every Wednesday night there was an [[IRC]] channel designated for listeners to meet up and win prizes. Pretty soon however, it was completely overrun by ''The Prize Pigs'', who became to the tubes what [[Bubba]] is to jail. They soon realized they could combine their [[awesome]] phone skillz  and every net night would clog the phone lines during the ''shout outs'' segment. 

They would flood the phone lines with specific Fat30:IRC memes the most prominent of which was an audio clip from ''I know what you did last summer'' where Jennifer Love-Hewitt screams "What are you waiting for huh? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!". It was also common later on in the IRC's existence to play The B-52's ''Love Shack'' as Big K. hated that song with a fiery vengeance.

==The Downfall==
All was well until one fateful day when CFM hired infamous whore [ttp://www.myspace.com/reneeaustralia Renee Peterson] to co-host the show. This bitch is the definition of [[anti-lulz]], turning what was an offensive and funny show into trendy garble for [[16 year old girl]]s.

The Big Kahuna was eventually fired and replaced with some dickhead named [http://www.myspace.com/mattyacton Matty Acton] and the show was re-named ''The Hit List''. It now plays trendy hip-hop bullshit, the exact crap the Big K. purposely kept out of the program.

Recently [http://www.myspace.com/thehitlistau The Shit List] had a competition with ''The Bench warmers'' in which whomever had the least MySpace friends by the end of the week would be slaves to the other. By the hand of God himself, The Benchwarmers won
