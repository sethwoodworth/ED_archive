Starcade
'''Starcade'''  was a [[luser]] on [[ISCABBS]] who was [http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/News/9805/26/showbuzz/ arrested] in May 1998 for [[stalker|stalking]] Debbie Gibson, who he refers to as "[[PowerWord: IRL Name|Deborah]]."

==Raep==

Starcade caused occasional drama in [[Usenet]] newsgroup rec.music.artists.debbie-gibson after becoming irate at Gibson's nonchaste behavior; less than two weeks before his arrest in May 1998, he posted the following [[rape]]-related comment.

By May 2002, Starcade had gotten out of jail and was claiming that, while [[suicide]] was still on the table, [[death|murder]] was no longer an option:

Subject: [NEWS]  Deborah to play Velma in "Chicago" Oct 29-Nov 17

Thanks to my "friends" *spit* [whom I will address in a moment] over
at Talkin' Broadway, we have learned that Deborah Gibson will be
playing the role of Velma in a regional production of "Chicago" Oct.
29-Nov.17 in the North Shore Music Theatre in Beverly, Massachusetts.

No, I will not be attending, but I am very happy for her, and, IMHO
[since you all know my fetish kinda matches Bob Fosse's choereography
anyway], she does have the look for it.  A promo splash for the play
has Deb in her "Shock Your Mama" dominatrix look with the caption
"Good Girl Gone Bad!"

-----------------

OK...

Now that I have dispensed with the news, and since the people over at
talkinbroadway.com read my posts, I wish to publicly tell them I do
the same for them, knowing that any mention of Deborah over there will
quickly be followed by a mention of myself.  They didn't fail to
disappoint.

If we want to talk about scary, let's understand, ladies and gentlemen
like Ann [the one over at talkinbroadway.com, not Ms. Skirvin -- and
I'm using the term "ladies and gentlemen" quite gingerly], the facts
that I have presented here.  Paul all but admitted I was correct in
stating that murder before suicide had been the belief for many many
months, and a mid-nineties post you can find on Google directly
references that one person actually openly stated murder before
suicide -- several _years_ before your sorry asses ever got involved.

That [murder before suicide] will not happen.  _HOWEVER_, I do caution
you one thing:  Unless you plan to take action for the sake of
yourselves, Do Not Taunt Happy Fun Ball.  In 1998, I at least felt I
had some sanity left.  Now I embrace all options -- including those
once felt unthinkable -- with the only exception that I will not harm
Deborah again.  I believe we live in a world where our President has
sold us out to energy lobbies and openly killed thousands of Americans
in New York City and beyond in an effort to decapitate this country to
consolidate power.

I died that night.  I live [in bodily form] now against my will.  I
don't know if I should ever be allowed to set foot in NYC again.

Trust me, I am not long for this world.  Whether that is 5 minutes or
5 years, I do not know.  But I am now open to a _MUCH_ larger scope of
belief than I was back in 1998.  I don't know if I could legally set
foot in another Broadway theatre, and better, frankly, that that be
handled in the courts too.
