Ventrilo
'''Ventrilo''' is a another step forward in the ways of communication on the [[Internet]], allowing [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] [[nerd]]s to communicate [[in the ass|voice to voice]]. It is also called "Vent", but [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody gives a shit]].

This: "Oh, STFU u SOB!! WTF is wrong with u!? My pet monkey can play more better than u, and he's my grandma!" is an example of common Ventrilo dialouge as their servers are full of [[internet tough guy]]s and 12 year old children. In other words, it's just like [[Teamspeak]].

== Lulz ==
Ventrilo, like [[Teamspeak]], is still an untapped market for [[lulz]], provided one has downloaded a voice changer in order to ensure that those who hear you cannot recognize how badly your voice fails.

There are many way to achieve lulz through [http://www.darkstarllc.com Ventrilo]. Here are some examples:
* Blow in your mic. It's simple, inexpensive, and your mic will work better as a result. Win-win!
* Go into a ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' server and talk about how badly you pwn noobs in [[Halo]]. [[lies|This will prove that you are indeed a man]].
* Make fart noises. As we all know, fart jokes are [[unfunny]] and farting in your mic is a sure sign that you are a [[serious business|serious]] badass black person.
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIgZBpWDwQU Destory the internal structure of WoW Guilds].
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7_De7Mlnxw Threaten people in EQ2 PVP that you will find ways to beat them, whether you are level 2, 20, or 80].
* Disagree with what everyone says no matter what they are talking about.
* Make fun of peoples voices.
* Have sex with yourself.
* ????
* VIRTUAL MONEY PROFIT!
