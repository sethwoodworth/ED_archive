Quentin Tarantino is an "[[India|indie]]" film director known for giving [[shit]]ty actors a second shot at a career so they can ruin it again (e.g., [[John Travolta]]).  His claim to fame is unapologetically stealing movies in their entirety and replacing the credits with his own.  He is in every sense the [[Eric Bauman]] of the film industry, and recently has come up with his own version of the infamous watermark:  ''"Presented by Quentin Tarantino"''.

His hype and popularity are kept by him being [http://www.godamongdirectors.com/tarantino/index.shtml constantly masturbated over] by [[13 year old boys]] on the internet for his ground-breaking use of the term: ''"[[nigger manual|dead nigger storage]]"''. 

Tarantino is idolized by [[13 year old boys]] because his movies are circle jerks of senseless, excessive violence and swearing with no point or plot. Just lame excuses to show senseless violence and random outbreaks of [[racism]] and [[japanophile|Orientalist]] fantasies about white people being submerged in Asian cultures. His movies depict the nonsensical, [[emo|unfocused rage, angst and anti-social fantasies]] of bored, middle class [[suburbs|suburban]] teenagers and young adults who aren't satisfied with the status quo but have no idea of what to do besides commit random acts of violence against [[niggers]], [[Azn|chinks]] and [[Weev|guys in suits]]. They say his movies are "stylistic" but that's bullshit. They're just extended scenes of shooting, stabbing, swearing and drug using with no plot and shitty editing. Apparently having no plot means that your movies are "non-linear" (read: doesn't know how to use an editing machine) or depict "ordinary people". "Ordinary people" must have a lot of free time, dark pasts, and lots of guns.

He is known for being a [[japanophile]], and a complete and utter [[luser]] who speaks too fast and has a [http://www.hollywoodinvestigator.com/tinsel/tarantino.htm foot fetish].   His unique facial features are a result of him using a jagged rock as a pillow when he sleeps.  When he is not being a smarmy asshole, he can be found in the editing room [[masturbation|jerking off]] to footage of Lucy Liu who is every Asiaphile white boy's fantasy china doll come to life.

His life story is a true rags-to-riches story as he was able to become the director he is today by doing what other upper-middle class suburban white people do: get connections. Your high school teachers probably had warned you about how plagiarism will ruin your career but looking at this article, you now know that is a load of crap.

===Reservoir Dogs===
While sitting in the video store he worked at, he was watching some free movies when he stumbled upon Stanley Kubrick's movie "''The Killing''", and Ringo Lam's "''Lung fu fong wan''" ([[Moonspeak]] for "''City On Fire''").  Quentin liked them so much, he ripped off the content of both of them; made a low-budget, poorly edited (aforementioned "non-linear style") piece of shit and slapped his name on it. To this day, [[fucktards|Quentin's fanboys]] still make [[TL;DR]] essays about the "Original Genius" of this blatant theft they dare call a movie.

One man was brave enough to go against the raging [[faggotry]] and made a short video on how much was taken from "''City on Fire''" called "'''Who Do You Think You're Fooling?'''".
This caused epic amounts of [[butthurt]] among Qt's fans who could only respond with flames and  say "[[ALLCAPS|EVERYBODY STEALS FROM EVERYBODY, SO IT'S A-OK AMIRITE? LOL!]]". Of course the [[banhammer]] fell on him and he was barred from the film festival.

'''Its Legacy:'''
*Reservoir Dogs lives on as a mostly forgotten awkward first attempt at [[smart|deep]] [[fanfiction|plotlines]]. Only starving film [[artfag|majors]] and {{youtube|Dl4tgFwYd_w|talentless machinima hacks}}  bother remembering how shitty it was, so that other moviegoers don't have to [[Suicide|punish themselves]] to see it.

===Pulp Fiction===
[[Image:Getgimp.jpg|thumb|Now you too can reenact your favorite anal-rape scene with this [[plastic crap|Kubric set]]!]]
''Pulp Fiction'', Quentin's "big break," loved by aforementioned 13 year-olds, people who love hearing "[[fuck]]" a lot, and people who love watching black person being [[In the ass|assraped]] by a guy in a gimp suit.  The film is known for being [[stupid|the recipient of an Oscar]] despite being on a shit budget, probably because Quentin spent all the money supplying his critics with enough [[drugs#Cocaine|blow]] for good reviews.
Most famous for the douche bag quote "royale with cheese". Written by Tarantino, you would have never guessed.

===Jackie Brown===
After snorting all his moneys worth of [[cocaine]] off Uma Thrurman's left foot after the success of ''Pulp Fiction'', Quentin Tarantino spent his last ten dollars on buying the rights to a shitty Elmore Leonard novel. You would think that because this next film of his was to be based off of a book, that it would leave Mr. Tarantino to not be a two-bit cock bandit who resorts to stealing from other films; you were wrong. Despite the book having a white female heroine, Quentin insisted on changing it to a black lead in his new vision of shit, which he called <u>Jackie Brown</u> (despite the novels original title being "Rum Punch"). The reason being was so that he could try to turn the film into a [[turd|blaxploitation film]] and give it more [[black chicks|attitude]]. This basically meant that Quentin could now incorporate more shitty elements from more shitty films that belonged in the annals of film history. [[Samuel L. Jackson]] starred in this film as well, this time portraying an obnoxious, angry black man who said fuck a lot. Pam Grier also tried to act her way through the film, but failed. Instead her robust Cadillac [[ass]] did most of the acting for her, and was [[Shit nobody cares about|nominated for a Golden Globe award for her performance.]] Robert De Niro was awarded a gallon of Quentin's [[cum|man jam]] for his performance in the film.
basically this film is a rip off of some money robbing scheme type film that fails on all levels.
an italian job without a  plot.

===Kill Bill Volume 1===
[[Image:Killbillfan.jpg|thumb|Typical Kill Bill fan]]
This movie is basically every [[japanophile]]'s wet dream become a reality. Quentin's creative [[expert|jeanyuss]] with this movie began with him forcing all of his favorite actors from [[azn]] cinema to gag on his cock. These actors include: Sonny Chiba, Chiaki Kuriyama, Chia Hui Liu, Lucy Liu, and many other famous [[azn]] actors who are now out of a job and need to suck dick for coke. After they signed to his movie, the actors of Kill Bill proceeded to have an intense bukkake session, the climax of which consisted of approximately ten gallons of semen all over Quentin's face.  The movie is done in his famous "non-linear" fashion, which is a creative name for [[shit]]-poor editing and storytelling. The movie is littered with numerous Japanese pop-culture references, pretentious "philosophical" quoting, arms flailing around which passes as Kung Fu for Tarantino, shit quality choreography and the unnecessary use of [[animu]].  However, the biggest achievement of this film is making fans pay full price for a half-assed movie that he couldn't even edit down.

===Kill Bill Volume 2===
Rest of the epic shitfest that didn't make it into the first movie.  Under normal circumstances this would be the special features of the DVD but, since Quentin's fans are such [[fucktards]], he can get away with it. We finally get to see the titular villain Bill, played by the <s>washed up hack</s> [[An_hero|an hero]] that <s>is</s> was [[David Carradine]], in what could possibly be the dumbest battle ever. Uma pokes him in the chest a few times, Bill says something and then he just fucking dies. That's about it.

===[[anal sex|Grindhouse]]===
[[Image:Grindhouse.jpg|thumb|OMG OMG GUN LEG!! oohhhh... [[masturbation|*fap*fap*fap*]]]]
Described by fantards as an "Homage to 70's B movies" (known to [[ED|the rest of us]] as more poorly justified theft) this is actually 2 films stuck together with some lulzy fake trailers.  Trying to learn from his previous editing catastrophe with ''Kill Bill'', Tarantino actually made a movie short enough... or so he thought.  Apparently his movie "''Death Proof''" was just below the minimum requirement to be considered a feature-length film so instead of putting the effort in to re-shoot and make it longer, he got Robert Rodriguez to slap together a filler movie about Rodriguez's amputation [[fetish]] called "''Planet Terror''" which people liked better than the garbage that Tarantino shat out.

Ultimately, however, nobody wants to see a four hour movie so nobody did. When it tanked, (just like a '70s B movie), Tarantino threw a [[911|media tantrum]] and blamed the studio for failing him. Meanwhile, before its release, when the studio suggested that it might be prudent to drop the movie as two separate films in order to make it easier on the public, Tarantino threw a [[911|hissy-fit]] and accused the studio of not understanding his [[ego|vision]]. QT fanboys were reported to be [[OMG|venting]] their angst all over the blogosphere.

===Hero===
Actually, he didn't make this one. But people assumed he did because, as the gullible sheep they are, he has his name on it, so he must have some involvement [[amirite]]?

===From Dusk till Dawn===

A "half-decent" movie that involves [[vampires]], but is still shit. The movie is well known for being including George Clooney, [[mexicans]], [[bewbs]], a [[loli]] and some [[christfag]]. Tarintino manages to make through half of the movie before getting [[pwn]].

===Inglourious Basterds===

Horrible Jew propaganda that rewrites history to make jews look like something more than cowardly money lenders and future lamp shades. Probably the most overrated piece of shit ever made. Brad Pitt and a bunch of jew niggers team up kill Nazis and shout "Bear Jew" every 4 seconds. Tarintino apparently still hasn't learned that violence and random talk about bullshit does not make for a good movie. Basically, Nazis kill a Jewish girl's family (highlight of the film) and then over 9000 years later Brad Pitt and Eli Roth play cards in a basement for like 5 hours. Then a cinema burns down and a nigger flees the scene of the crime. To top off a great movie, Brad Pitt shits on a man's Chest. The End.

==Personal Life==
[[Image:Quentintar-highheels.jpg|thumb|Tarantino being even more fucking creepy]]
Tarantino was born an "addicted baby", to a crackhead hermaphrodite prostitute who had no vagina, and therefore had to be evacuated via her asshole, making him a literal human turd. He was born legs first, and at the end of the birth (bowel movement), his mother sneezed, which clenched her rectum, causing the grotesquely misshapen state of his giant head. The sneeze also crushed his brain, thereby rendering him genetically incapable of generating new or original thoughts. This explains his trademark style of stitching a montage of stolen ideas into an addled, pointless mess of lowest common denominator pandering, generously described as a feature film. 

His personal mission was to dupe the gullible masses by superficially pretending to challenge the status quo of current Hollywood studios (not "for serious" independent filmmaking, since it lacks balls and creative integrity), by working within it and being just as racist, unoriginal, misogynistic, base minded, and shamelessly cash greedy, but adding trendy and pretentiously obscure references and eye patches (stolen from Swedish film, [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072285/ ‘Thriller: A Cruel Picture']). To anybody with a mental age above 13 who actually knows film (decidedly this is not the Tarantino audience), these references fail to be obscure, and reasonably come off as simply uncreative and hackneyed.

==Trolling==

Tarantino is also a very [[whiny|lulzy]] IRL troll in his spare time.
