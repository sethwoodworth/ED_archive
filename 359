'''Aliza Shvarts''' is an [[rich|Ivy League]] Jew college student and self-styled "[[Attention whore|fetus artist]]" who made headlines on 17 April 2008 by [[troll]]ing the entire planet with her latest project: spending 8 months of her life popping out [[baby fuck|aborted fetuses]] at Yale University. Her project was conveniently timed to coincide with the visit of [[The Pope|Pope Benedict XVI]] to [[America]]. When it comes to MOD-URN art, the word "miscarriage" was exclusively used to describe the piece. Aliza boldly cuts out the middlewomyn, making the piece itself a literal miscarriage.

Her phone number is (559) 772-7911, she likes being called "Gingi", ask for her photos. WHERE ARE THE PHOTOS, JEW?

Aliza's senior art project is a documentary video of how she got pregnant by artificially inseminating herself with donated sperm multiple times and then used "morning after" pills (although every retard knows morning after pills cannot cause an abortion because they are just high doses of regular birth control pills) to end her pregnancies, as well as preserved samples of her own blood that she would later use in [[Goth|lesbian vampire orgies]]. 

With this, Shvarts has managed to troll both [[pro life]] and [[pro choice]] people. The former are [[shocked & appalled]] because Shvarts casually gave herself abortions to further her "art."  The latter are outraged because they feel she is trivializing an [[SFB|important issue]] and making the [[shit nobody cares about|hard choice women face]] with an unwanted pregnancy into something [[lulz|absurd]].

Of her [[prank|stunt]], Aliza stated:

{{squote|I believe strongly that art should be a medium for politics and ideologies, not just a commodity... I think that I'm creating a project that lives up to the standard of what art is supposed to be.|Aliza Svarts, being a pretentious little fuck}}

==LOL JK==

As of May 2008, Yale has maintained that she [[it was a social experiment|made the whole thing up and that the 'deception' is part of the larger project]]. Shvarts apparently told three senior Yale University officials, including two deans, that she did not do the things she claimed in her art project, and that the whole thing was a work of [[bullshit|"creative fiction."]]

==TROLL'D==
[[Image:Internet_superhero_motiv.jpg|thumb|Previous to the art project, Aliza posted to a [[4chan|popular internet forum]] warning of her intention.]] 
Shvarts, the slippery Jew ([[In before X|in b4u]]), [http://yaledailynews.com/articles/view/24528 continues to claim] that Yale is [[doing it wrong|“ultimately inaccurate”]], and that she did indeed have multiple abortions. As proof of her epic troll, Shvarts has shown the Yale Daily News footage from tapes that she planned to play at the exhibit. The tapes depict her alone in a shower stall, bleeding into a cup. At times during the tape, she was naked; at others, she wasn't.

[[LOL WUT|Shvarts said her project would take the form of a large cube suspended from the ceiling of a room in the gallery, around which she would wrap hundreds of feet of plastic sheeting lined with blood from her self-induced miscarriages.]] Recorded videos of her [[Win|experiencing her miscarriages]] would be projected onto the four sides of the cube and similar videos would also be displayed on the walls of the room.

[[Some argue]] that Shvarts is a massive [[attention whore]], while others believe she is [[I did it for the lulz|doing this for the lulz]], which would make her the Muse of Lulz.

{{quote|I have a certificate of mental illness right here waiting for your signatures. First, we arrest her, then find her incompetent to stand trial, she goes to the mental institution. Let her out to attend trail in about two years, after lots of neuroleptic medication, then fond her guilty of public indecency, she goes to the can for a month, but then we invoke Hendrix V> Kansas, and stick her back in the nut house for another five years. When she come out she has tardive diskensia and looks like a old hag making faces. I call that a just punishment.
