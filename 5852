Now
{{needsmoar|article}}

'''Now''' is the period of [[history]] after [[before the internets]]. In other words: A point in time already being permanently gone when recognizing it is/ was there. Cannot be used to codecs too well whether it works fine as IRL-command term. 
Persons alive at this time include:
* [[you]]
* [[George W. Bush]]
* [[God]]
* [[Satan]]
* [[gay]]s
* [[your mom]]
* [[camwhore]]s
* [[nerd]]s
* <strike>[[Steve Irwin]]</strike> [[DISREGARD THAT]]
* [[geek]]s
* Countless other things...

[[Some argue]] that now is a key component of [[Shit nobody cares about|applicable]] [[quantum]] [[physics]] in the field of time travel. Let's do an exercise to [[proof|prove]] this point; go to the talk page, add a [[comment]] and sign it. It will log what time 'now' is.

Now do the following:
* Get off [[teh]] [[internets]]
* Go outside
* Run around screaming about your [[STD|crabs]]
* Go down the shops for a bit
* Eat some [[pie]]
* Bring democracy to the [[USA]]
* Come back [[OL]]
* Post another comment
* You just lost the game
You will find that the time now is different to the time 'now' that you posted before. [[OMG]] YOU [[Liek|LIEK]] TRAVELED THROUGH TIME!!![[oneoneone]]
