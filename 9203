'''Xbox 360''' also known as '''Shitbox Three Fixme''', '''Ecksbawcks thweesicksty''', and '''Ekthbokth Thweethickthty''' to [[retards]] and '''Failbox 360''' to [[Playstation#Oh sh1t fanboism|haters]]  is the next shitty version of [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] [[Xbox]], as well as the first video game console [[What|designed specifically to not work at playing games]]. It contends with [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]], [[Sony]]'s [[Playstation 3]], and the [[Atari|Atari 2600]] with a shiny MSRP of [[OVER 9000|$9,001]] <s>(a fraction of the price of the PS3)</s> (Lolnotanymoar). The Xbox 360 is currently [[Winnar|out-selling]] the [[PS3]] by 3 million units mostly due to 360 fanbois having to buy new ones because the first 3 units shit-the-bed. Which is sad considering the 360 came out a year before the [[PS3]] and was a lot cheaper. But it is doing [[luser|worse]] than the [[Wii]] because every [[Loli|five-year-old girl]], [[your mom|senior citizen]], and [[azn]] bought two or three.  This new generation of the Ecks Bawks has had massive game sales with such titles as ''[[Bioshock]]'', ''[[Gears of War]]'', and ''[[Halo 3]]''.  Also, it should be noted that the Xbox 360 has a shorter life expectancy than the average [[Africa|African]]. Anywhere from [[statistics|99%-100%]] of 360 consumers have fallen victim to the infamous '''Red Ring of Death''' and scratched discs, yet it has sold [[at least 100]] times more games than [[Fail|Phail]][[Cock|Smegma]] 3, although it was surpassed by the [[Wii]]'s [[quality]] line-up of [[Fat|fitness programs]].

==Xbox 360 Hardware Failures==
[[Image:Broke again.jpg|thumb|right|Fucking Microsoft. 2nd breakdown.]]
Xbox 360 is one of the biggest hardware [[failure|failures]] in mankind's memory, as it was released with a [[Shitty|poor]] design that makes [[you]] play against the odds when you buy one. [[Statistics|2 out of every 3]] Xbox 360's sold will totally fail on its [[Owned|owner]] (or moar).  According to [[clever|Microshit]], they have made several fixes in the ecks bawks 360.  The unassuming patron will then [[fail|attempt]] to send his 360 back to Microsoft under the 3 year warranty, only to realize that his [[h4x|modded]] system is void.  This will cause him to [[poor|start his life from scratch]] for having to get a new one (or alternatively, get [[Suicide|IRL B&]]). And even those [[nerds]] that do send their systems back to Microsoft have to wait up to a month to get a new system, forcing them to do things other than play video games, such as interact socially with other people.  As a "[[Final Solution|solution]]," Microsoft released the [[1337|Elite]] edition, which has some new [[Shit nobody cares about|cleverly designed internal hardware and a sleek, shiny look]], but still suffers the '''Red Ring of Death'''. It also features a [[black]], PS3 wannabe [[Foreskin|skin]], which gives Microsoft even [[moar]] [[lulz]] out of their [[retarded]] customers as their 360s die. 

However, [[Basement Dweller|Bill Gates]] isn't laughing anymore after finding out that the 360's hardware problems will cost him [[Over 9000|over one billion]] USD. [http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/mgs4-this/microsoft-extends-xbox-360-warranty-costs-1-billion-275432.php]

==Xbox 360 Fanboys==
[[Image:Xboxgirl.jpg|thumb|right|Not [[IRL]] in [[XBox Live]]]]
[[Image:Xbox-doing-it-right.jpg|thumb|right|[[IRL]] on [[XBox Live]]]]
[[Image:lilboy.jpg|thumb|right|Typical Xbox Live players or at least that's what they sound like on the stupid microphone.]]
Xbox 360 [[Fanboy|fanboys]] are known for their low IQs and aggression, as opposed to [[Fag|PS3 Fanboys]], [[Narcissistic|who enjoy thinking that they have a high IQ]]. If one is not on IRC trolling #ps3 chans, it is probably going out of its way to make shitty montages on [[YouTube]] to show people how its shitty, unreliable console beats the others. YouTube is filled with the lousy videos and songs of 360 fanboys: see "[http://youtube.com/watch?v=KfmBzllkbUM How to Kill a Brand] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdNLbAoGnDk No Fun]" by some idiots who obviously can't sing. They also like to spam PS3 videos with their idiocy, writing with as much skill as a [[dinosaur]] with a typewriter, even though [[PS3]] fanboys also follow this mentality. They also are obsessed with spelling words out extra long in [[ALL CAPS]]. A common quote from an Xbox 360 fanboy is, "NOOOOOOOOOO XBOOOOXXX 360 ISSS SOOOOOOOO MUUUUCCCHHH BEEEETTTTTERRRR FUUUCCCKKK PLAAYSTATIONNN THREEE. They also like to [[fap]] to Master Chief and go on about ''[[Halo]] 3'', one of the most overrated shooters in history. Xbox Live fanboys have the overwhelming need to teabag [[You|every fucking thing in sight.]]  They claim to have made it famous [[Shit nobody cares about|though it actually originated on Unreal Tournament]]. Xbox Live bitches will inevitably cause you to want to obliterate everything with their idiocy. After all what is worse than having some [[noob|tard Rocket you]] after you have just finished beating down the [[Virgin|highest ranking player]] and then whining down their mic [[Badger Badger Badger|"TeabagteabagteabagOWNEDOWNED"]].

Xbox fanboys are also known for assaulting PS3 fanboys during discussions and later stating that the other was "tlking shit bout [[XBox Live|xbox liev]]," even if the person was only admitting to liking another console. they are egotistical over their precious console, even if the PS3 Fanboys we're way worse, the 360 fanboys take the [[Delicious Cake|Cake]].

Xbox 360 fanboys also buy their competition's consoles (used) and try to get their hit games in their hands as soon as possible so their can write 1/10 reviews and put them on [[Gamefaqs]].  They also whore forums and [[fap|talk]] about a game which as is forum tradition will just become a thread about feltch induced acne or bitching about the [[Playstation|gaystation]] to subdue their own [[Security Faggotry|insecurities]] concerning the [[Microsoft|choice they made]].

More recently, [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|in contrast to the statement above]], a strange occurrence amongst certain self-aware Xbox 360 fanboys has caused them to become [[butthurt]] over the fact that they were - and still are - too poor to afford a [[Playstation 3]].  This symptom is typically only displayed for a few seconds by most 360 fanboys, after which they will consume a [[Semen|generic energy drink]] and [[fap|play]] [[moar]] Gaylo 3.

==Why call it the 360?==
[[Image:360_moonwalk.gif|thumb|right|When you see it, you'll turn 360 degrees and [[Michael Jackson|moonwalk]] away]]
[[Image:1276668521184.jpg|thumb|right|Better yet, [[DO IT FAGGOT|Just do this]]]]
[[Image:GrampaSimpsonXBOX360.gif|thumb|right|When Grandpa Simpson sees it, he turns 360 degrees and then walks away.]]
There are many theories as to why Microsoft decided to call it the 360 instead of just Xbox 2.

[[Some argue|Some]] would have you think that it is because they thought Xbox 2 would sound inferior to Playstation 3, Sony's upcoming game console. Of course, this is [[Small cock|Microshaft]] we're talking about, so we're not going to give them that much credit.  Instead, we'll say that this was their attempt at ripping off the name of [[Wii|Nintendo's new system]], then codenamed the 'Revolution'.  How craptacular of you, Bill Gates. A related theory is that the '360' is meant to imply that the device is a 'revolution' in console gaming - This is very likely as only pussy-starved nerds like Bill Gates could equate safe, comfortable video games with ZOMG COOL BURNING DEATH CHE GUEVARRA LULZ.

However, a rapidly growing theory is that it took Bill Gates 359 prototypes to [[doing it wrong|get it right]].

And yet another theory is that its called 360 because they wanted to turn the original [[Xbox]]'s shitiness around 360 degrees... or 180 degrees... or whatever... meaning they knew the flaws of the Xbox but did nothing to fix them in any way.

Another possibility is that it's named the 360 because you can't run away from your problems.

And still yet another theory exists; this one probably the most popular of the bunch.  The complex thought process of this theory can be easily summed up in the following lines:

{{quote|Why do they call it the Xbox 360?

Because when you see it, you'll turn 360 degrees and walk away.|Oh, snap! [[Pwnt|Own3d!]]}}


{{quote|Oooh yes [[PS3]], you're the best. Fuck me HexBox Three-sissty. The only reason they call it a motherfucking Three-sissty is cause when you see it, you'll turn Three-sissty degrees and walk away. Ohh yeah, PS3 your the best, fuck me fuck me..|[[Chris-Chan]] being a typical fanboy, recording himself fucking his PS3.}} 


There are two sides to the debate surrounding this theory, based on the individual's reaction to the above hypothesis.  Party one, composed of [[Chris-Chan|retard]]s and [[troll]]s, believes this to be both a reasonable assumption and a great insult to 360 fanboys.  The other party contests that turning 360 degrees would leave you still facing the console, and that the correct rotation is actually 180 degrees [http://wsu.edu/~brians/errors/360.html].  This side of the argument is composed of intelligent individuals and those too stupid to realize [[YHBT|they've been trolled]].

This unassailable argument has become something of a [[meme]] on the [[internet]] (and a very annoying one at that), most notably on [[4chan]], the home of irritating, retarded memes.  It started on 4chan's [[v/|videogame board]], but soon spread like a [[AIDS|California wildfire]] to other boards.  [[Expert]]s are still unable to determine if the original post was made by a fucking moron or a clever troll.  All that is known is that people continue to post this message in hopes of stirring up [[drama]], even months after the meme has gone [[Old meme|out of style]].

There are many amusing responses and counters to this trolling attempt.  For instance, it is never stated that the viewing party cannot "moonwalk" away from the console.  So, "When you see it, you'll turn 360 degrees and moonwalk away."  It is also never stated whether you were directly facing the console when you saw it, or whether you happened to catch a glimpse out of you peripheral vision.  A couple alterations include:

*''"Why do they call it the PS3?  Because when you see it, you'll turn 3 degrees and walk slightly askew."''
*''"Why do they call it the Atari 2600?  Because when you see it, you'll turn 2600 degrees, be extremely dizzy, and possibly vomit."''
*''"Why do they call it the Wii? perhaps when you see it you piss on it and walk in the same direction over it"''
*''"why do they call it the sega dreamcast? cause youre stuck in the past, faggot!"''

As well as any other [[Unfunny|devastatingly witty]] variations [[you]] can think up.  Of course, the most effective response when faced with this situation is to simply call the [[OP]] a faggot, turn 360 degrees, and walk away from your computer.

==XBLA==
When you get on [[XBox Live]] you have the option to buy [[shit nobody cares about|old and indie games]] through the XBL Marketplace. However, nobody wants to pay for them since you can get most of them [[OTI]] for [[free]] through emulation and [[torrent|torrents]].  Also, the controller is gay for 2D games, but gamers will do anything for [[shit nobody cares about|achievement points]]. This is done in their attempt to get a bigger [[e-penis]], but they don't know that it only helps to tell the world how much [[basement dweller|life they don't have]].

Xbox Live Arcade was called on Arab a deliberate scam. [[pussy|Police Officials]] investigated why Microsoft was cashin in on so much [[pussy|Dubbie.]] Police can confirm that MS was indeed selling shitloads of XBLA titles that many of their [[Retarded]] customers owned! Making 800 [[pussy|MSP]] off each sale Police were suspicious that MS had recently bought Cuba and started growing [[OVER 9000|Acres and Acres]] of Marijuana fields.

==Why it r0x0rz==	
[[Image:inurxbox.jpg|thumb|[[at least 100 years|At least 100 years ago]], [[Bill Gates]] did 0102 [[IDIFTL|for the lulz]].]]
The 360 is almost compatible with the original Xbox (if you either spend the extra $150 on the '1337 edition or buy the hard drive separately). It can also play games wirelessly [[OTI]] like both the other consoles. Assuming that is you have one of the ones with, or have acquired a hard drive. Then just buy the $99 Microsoft wireless adapter. Oh, then pay $50 a year for live GOLD to access the multiplayer feature on the game you already bought, on the system you already own, over the internet connection you already pay for. It overheats if you look at it funny, meaning you can use it as a space heater or toaster oven in a pinch. It also uses enough power to light New York for a month.
[http://www.hardcoreware.net/reviews/review-356-2.htm]  If you touch it while it's on, it will gouge holes in your disk, which is cool if you're like trying to ruin that [[furry]] watersports DVD you bought while you were drunk. And, like, they totally have ''[[gaylo]]'' for it, hai guys?

It makes up for lack of features and backwards compatibility by looking super awesome (like a Mac). Microsoft realized that [[Apple]] had been getting away with selling [[communism|shitty hardware]] for years by making it sleek and shiny and copied the secret viral transparent beveled button theme.

Additionally, the Xbox 360 can pour coffee and make its own gravy, even though the official website [[lie|claims it doesn't]].

==lol Xbox is small==
Responding to complaints that the original Xbox was the size of an average planetary system, Microsoft engineered their new Xbox to appear [[pro-ana|svelte, slim and shiny]].
	
Then they gave it a power supply roughly the size of Jupiter. Good work Bill.  This power supply has caused much [[lulz]] in that it gets incredibly hot, [[kill it with fire|melts CDs]] and [[fail|stops functioning]]. This has caused a great deal of [[suicide|distress]] amongst Xbox fanboys everywhere.

These advancements have made manufacturing difficult, leading to a shortage of the Xbox 360.  In fact, the only ones manufactured were intended for [[Bill Gates]]' adopted children, but the truck was hijacked by angry gamers en route to [[Washington]]. When they found that the rumored ''Fable: [[Yaoi]] Edition'' was not on board, the truck was diverted to Best Buys across the country, and no units have been manufactured since.

==[[Halo 3|Xbox: The New Gayening]]==
[[Image:XboxAvatarLineup.jpg|thumb|left|What do you get when you cross a Mii with The Sims? You get this [[faggotry]].]]
[[Image:Steampunk.jpg|thumb|[[basement-dwellers|People]] [[lol wut|pay up to $20 plus tax for this shit]] ]]
[[Image:Armyofdunner.jpg|thumb| Dear god! [[Gaia|What have we unleashed?]]]]
On November 19, 2008, — a day that will forever live in infamy - Microsoft released NXE, a mandatory patch that somehow managed to instantly transform Xboxes around the world into already steaming piles of [[fail]].  The interface that [[fag|fags]] worldwide had come to know and fanboy over had been replaced by a maze of vague menus, more advertisements than prime-time television, and a shitty [[Wii|Mii]] avatar knockoff.

On August 11, 2009, A new update came out for the gay box 360 that now let's you buy shitty overpriced clothes and toys for your mii knockoff. Thus turning your Xbox dashboard into a watered down version of The Sims [[bullshit|except you're using IRL money for this worthless crap]].  Whether lighting things on fire, pissing blue liquid, or having gay sex with other avatars are in the works for a future update is unknown at this point. However there are rumors of a hub-world in the works, similar to Playstation Home, causing Playstation fanboys to [[shit bricks|shit dick]]s.

==Xbox 360 Slim==
Microsoft demonstrates the Xbox 360 Slim's DVD repair feature.  Also if your Xbox 360 Slim gets the "green ring of death" and its over a year old Microsoft wont repair it for free since they changed the warranty back to a year for the Slim

===Project Natal/Kinect===
Some mad gay shit right here and ripoff of the Eye[[Dildo|Toy]]. It's going to suck. Everybody knows that console add-ons suck; ask SEGA. These fanboys obviously fall into the hole and buy another shitty console not knowing they are getting ripped off.
Now called "kinect" and <s>[[SNCA|still nobody cares]]</s> it [http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/kinect-long-term-privacy-issues-daunting lets Microsoft watch you play XBox 360 naked!] ([http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/02/microsoft-cryptome/ Of course they didn't want you to know that]. [http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2010/02/microsoft-online-services-global-criminal-compliance-handbook.pdf They also didn't want you to see this document] and got DCMA invovled to take down a website that blow the whistle on them.) It even costs more than Playstation move however with Kinect that extra money you are paying for is invisible controllers. Plus more money for nothing important

[http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/kinect-long-term-privacy-issues-daunting Microsoft changed the TOS of the Xbox 360 in late October which allows them to use any(all) information the Kinect gathers when you use it for their own purpose to sell your information to make money.]  So if you decided to play the latest Call of Duty game naked, remember to unplug the Kinect if you decided to waste $150 on that piece of shit

===THE SHIT HITS THE FAN=== 
[[Last thursday]] It was proven that Kinect will break your HD TV, SRSLY check this out.[http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/708463/first-kinect-broken-tv-reported.html]

<youtube>nB_GMm5qxpM</youtube>

===Other updates include:===
*Buying full priced games online (which is a terrible idea since you will never have enough disk space to store more than five games).  You will also need to always be connected to Live if you want to play the games that you paid for. 
*Watching Netflix with your "friends" online, which is more expensive than just [[logic|finding a movie on one of the many many many many MANY movie streaming sites on the internet.]]
*A rating system which can easily be exploited by [[lulz|rating everything as 1 star]] and games that have barely showed any gameplay will be rated 5 stars because they are made by bungie or have the words "call of duty" in them.
*You can open the disc drive from the dashboard now, since you can't be bothered to get off your fat ass and push the eject button on the console. It's still utterly pointless since [[Fail|you still have to get up and change the discs from the tray]].
*The most recent update completely [[b&]] all 3rd party memory units, as their superior memory capacity was giving Microsoft penis envy. Oh, and Microsoft will make dickloads of money by forcing people to buy only their shitty memory units.[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25738]
*And finally a Facebook/Twitter add-on because that shit has to be everywhere!
*Apparently the most recent update in November 2010 has bricked some consoles, even though they weren't modded either via chip or software.
*The newly released 'slim' system removes all compatibility for X-Box 1.0 games, including those that were bought online on the XBLA online store. Once again, M$ fucks the customer over.
*With the latest update, you can now 'install' games to the hard drive. This is pointless because you still need the disc inside the drive, which still spins. 

tl;dr the update made the ass box three-shitty just as shitty as it was before, if not more so.
