'''Bolt''' is an [[internets]] community that seems like it began [[last Thursday]], but don't be fooled! It's really been around for [[at least 100 years ago|at least 100 years]]. It came from [[shit nobody cares about|meager beginnings]] back in 1998, but after Hotmail started including it on its "What would you like to be [[spam]]med with?" sign up options, it took off like a shot.

Soon, the [[retarded]]-user-friendly design, impressive amount of [[Capitalism|cool corporate sponsorship]], and candy colors had attracted swarms of [[goth]]s, [[punk]]s, [[hippie]]s, [[16-year-old girl]]s and [[13-year-old boy]]s. Soon, all the awesome usernames like [[gay|Blood_Gulch42069]] and [[slut|SweetyDevil69420]] were taken and people were left with the dregs like [[Sephiroth|S3PH1R0TH_XX]] and [[whore|DevilSweety666420]].

==OMG DO MY TAGS PLZ==

For most, Bolt was a candy-colored dreamland of [[sex|social activity]]. You could send messages to one another (though only one every 30 seconds), [[instant messaging|IM]] each other using the ''ZAP!'' feature (though this was frequently down due to the [[ghey]]), or even make a post on its wide array of [[BBS|bulletin boards]] (though these were moderated to the point of [[cyberfascism]]).

The most popular feature was the Tagbook. Here you could ask [[insane]], pointless questions of the entire four million-strong community and hear their answers. "Tags" are thought to be a sort of evolved form of [[comment]]s, as [[comment whore]]s and tag whores share a similar narcissistic frenzy.

During its heyday, there would be upwards of 5000 users [[masturbating|checking their horoscope]] at any given time.

==Bolt Gets Old==

Fortunately, Bolt [[jumped the shark]] around three years ago after making major changes to its design, dividing into two separate websites, and selling out entirely to some faceless [[Japan|Japanese]] corporation or something, making it slightly less [[retarded]]-user-friendly. There are only 1000 or so [[16-year-old girl]]s and [[13-year-old boy]]s now using the site at any given time.

One of the largest nails in Bolt's coffin was the first example of corporations trolling teh internets. In 2003, Fox [[Rupert Murdoch]] raided Bolt's bulletin boards by adding the official [[American Idol]] boards, crashing the servers, and creating much [[butthurt]] for many months afterwards. Many raids were declared on the American Idol boards from the other forums, but the Bolt overlords with pocketsfull of dirty money became liberal with the [[banhammer]].

Bolt ''was'' what [[MySpace]] ''is''. In fact, they are pretty much the same exact thing.
