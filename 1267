Do not try to find the '''CIA'''; that's impossible. Instead try to realize the truth, [[The Matrix|there is no CIA]].

== Overview ==

The Club for International [[Anarchy]](a.k.a [[Irony|Cock Increment Agency]]) (CIA) was founded [[at least 100 years ago]] by the Artificial Intelligence Computer (AIC) as an escape from the drudgery and laws of society. The manifesto of CIA members, or "agents" causing [[chaos]] and mayhem by any means available. To this end they have been known to experiment with psychoactive [[drug]]s, [[goatse]], mind control, and blanket surveillance. They are constantly watching everything, listening to everything, smelling everything (including your sister's panties). They have eyes everywhere, from orbital satellites to traffic cameras, all pointed at [[your]] bedroom window. The CIA are highly secretive, but are widely known for such pranks as [[phreak|illegal phone tapping]], inciting [[revolution]], kidnapping, assassination of key [[political]] figures, blowing up [[Afghanistan|sandniggers]] with missiles, training and supporting the same sandniggers in the 80's and even leaving lint in the clothes dryer trap. They are rumored to be closely associated with the [[Jews]]. Many people have seen the Men in Black but are unable to recall the event. [[Will Smith|They]] won't let you remember. The CIA also has a habit of ousting democratically elected leaders, and also ruining the lives of other people for the benefit of the USA.

You now have 38 seconds to [[gtfo|get the fuck out]] of your house.

== Rules of CIA ==

# You do not talk about CIA.
# You DO NOT talk about CIA.
# If someone says stop, goes [[Impotence|limp]], taps out, the mission is over.
# Two agents to a mission.
# One mission at a time.
# Black shirts, black shoes (Johnny Cash, for example, was a CIA agent).
# Missions will go on as long as they have to.
# If this is your first night at CIA, you have a mission.
# If a mission goes bad then you know where the cyanide tablets are.
# CIA must not be confused with [[FBI]] or [[IBM]].
