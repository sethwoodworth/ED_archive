Saint Patrick's Door
{{forced}}

== Saint Patrick's Door ==

'''Saint Patrick's Door''' is the most powerful cancer known to the [[4chan|Internets]]. Some newfag (Doorfag) found a [[CP|picture]] of a door on google and posted it on /b/ saying "Knock knock, /b/". Then /b/ just crashes and the door becomes a [[meme|meme]] because it's stuck on the first page and at the very top. Currently no one knows what's [[Something_Awful|behind the door]] (except for doorfag); although several people have attempted to guess.

== The Day /b/ Stopped ==

On [[Last_Thursday|March 17, 2010]], /b/ stopped. Some [[Newfag]] (now called [[Faggot|doorfag]]) opened Saint Patrick's Door, and /b/ ceased to be. He later went to /po/ and opened a Saint Patrick's Door there.
The rest of 4chan suffered as well, but recovered in hours. <strike>As of now, /b/ is still frozen, with the door staring at us, taunting us. /b/ moved to /po/ and /x/, where they spread their faggotry to these boards. The cancer that killed /b/ may claim two more victims if not stopped. </strike> The door was then closed on the following morning.

== Doorfag ==
[[faggot|Doorfag]] is just a typical /b/tard. Browsing /b/, waiting for something [[epic]] to happen. <strike>Some say he was the one who caused 4chan to go haywire.</strike> No, he was not. Merely, just an unsuspecting newfag who got overly excited at seeing his thread [[Lose|win]] internetz and his door becoming a [[The_cancer_that_is_killing_b|meme]]. But overall, doorfag is a pretty [[fag|cool]] guy, he haz [[AIDS|doorz]] and doesnt afraid of anything.

== Doorfag Responds to his Newfaggotry with a song ==

''I was only a newfag... Sitting alone in my room.I happened across an idea, and then the idea began to blooooooom. I went to google and found a picture of a door, and then went back to /b/ and saw all you whores. So I thought it'd be funny to post knock knock, /b/, and then the next thing I knowwww I did more damage than what happened to Haiti. I was the faggot who killed /b/, I'm truly very sorry, I didn't know my door could win so hard. You're not defeated, /b/, not yet, not ever. So stand up and fight and forget about my newfaggotry.''-->

Several hours later Doorfag attempted to delete the door, [[fail|but with no changes to /b/ at all.]]

== /b/ Finally Unfreezes ==
On March 18, 2010 the Saint Patrick's Door was closed, and /b/ resumed to cancer......''[[Nothing_of_value|AND NOTHING OF VALUE WAS GAINED/LOST]]'' And what happened to Doorfag, you ask? He now goes by Doorfag at all times, you'll see his name a lot when browsing threads on /b/, butthurt that so many people use his door as a meme now.
