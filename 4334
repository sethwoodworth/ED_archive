'''Jim Groat''' is unique in the rabid cesspit that is "[[furry]]", as he was able to find a woman who would let him [[sex|ejaculate inside of her birth canal]], thus producing [[babyfur|furry spawn]].  Thus, he must be considered doubly damned, as he has propagated furfaggotry into a new generation.  This has caused him to take a great deal of flak from butt-humping [[Jailhouse gay]] furries jealous of his astounding success with <s>women</s> a woman.

When "furry" dragged its slimy collective carcass out of the primordial ooze, Jim Groat wandered through its early, primitive [[convention|conventions]], [[unfunny|making snide comments about smurfs]].  Apparently, he believed that an adult who heaped scorn upon a decade-old, universally disliked children's TV show was the ultimate in "Cool" and "Edgy."  Considering the fucked-up and socially retarded crowd he hung with, this was sometimes relatively true.

Jim Groat has had a lifelong obsession with the acquisition and overuse of firearms- which is typical among aspiring sodomites who are lacking the genitals to get the job done.

He is also a dedicated [[retard|republican]], and frequently masturbates over catalogs of replicated Nazi swag. One would not expect this, considering that he is a Jew, but at least he admits that he deserves to be [[exterminated]]. 

==PROFIT!!!==

Currently, he makes his living by selling third-rate furry pr0n and sifting through garbage cans, while living in a house encrusted with lizard feces.  <s>This is [[fact]] as evidenced by the following video:</s> Deleted.
