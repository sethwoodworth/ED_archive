In the mid 90's, [[PlayStation]] fanbois rejoiced at the "newest" survival-horror game, ''Silent Hill''. Featuring [[Computer graphics|shitty graphics]] (using the lame excuse that it made the game [[no|creepier]]), terrible controls, and lack of coherent plot line, it naturally became a best seller in [[America]] and [[Britain]], spawning <s>five</s> '''four''' sequels, <s>three</s> '''two''' prequels, a movie, [[dildo|toys]], an arcade game, comics...wow, [[Konami]] really had some free time.

==The Town==
[[File:Sh2.jpg|thumb|''Silent Hill'' has lots of fog. This was done intentionally to create atmosphere, and to mask the lousy engine's clipping and pop-up problems. ]]

Silent Hill is a town that just can't get it's story straight. It's almost like none of the designers past the third game ever bothered to play the games before them. Maybe it's a case of [[no|trying to revamp a series]], but, most likely, it's just that they were [[tl;dr|too lazy]] to even try. 

Three things are constant in any Silent Hill game
# The town is foggy (or has snow/ash/rain). This makes up for the designers' inability to remove the many clipping issues the games have.
# There are monsters. Since Silent Hill 2 these monsters have been made increasingly more [[fap]]able in order to increase the [[Sick Fuck|size of the fanbase]].
# There is some sort of paranormal crap going on. Either that or the main character is [[insane]].

Mixing the three you get convoluted maps that are [[WTF|different every game even though it's always the same town]]. Even the few reused landmarks (hospital, school, hotel) move, so don't bother using those to pinpoint your location. For bonus geek points, count the number of name changes each landmark has through the games.

Here is a quick overview of just the paranormal elements. 

* Silent Hill: [[WTF]]? No clue what's going on... most likely aliens.
* Silent Hill 2: James is insane. Either that or [[aliens|the dog did it all]].
* Silent hill 3: There is a cult worshiping the monsters as servants of god, even going so far as equating each monster to a [[Christian]] angel. Valatiel (crank guy) is Metatron and Pyramid Head is [[WTF|archangel Michael]]. Either that or Heather is [[Sailor Moon]]! 
* Silent Hill 4 (The room): Vengeful ghosts are causing it all.
* Silent Hill the movie: A cult has channeled [[Satan]] into the form of a little girl (Alessa/Cheryl). Oh, and something about parallel dimensions?
* Silent Hill 5 (Orgins): Takes a nod from the movie, yet fails to even sync up facts from the film!
* Silent Hill 6 (Homecoming): Alex is insane. Oh, and maybe a cult?
* Silent Hill 7 (Shattered memories): Cheryl is insane and remembering the past. Also, strong ice motif just to be [[retarded|different]].
* Silent Hill 8: Most likely something to do with insanity or cults. Also, strong water motif just to be [[retarded|different]]]
====Common Themes====
[[File:Sh3bunny.jpg|thumb|150px|We weren't kidding about the furries]]
[[Image:No_dog.jpg|thumb|He's an observant one.]]
*[[WTF|Adorable fat little squeaky ghosts that don't do shit and are just there to be cute]]. They just squeak when you run and "scare" them.
*[[Furries]]
* [[Insane]] main characters
*Jumping/reaching into a [[anus|hole]]
*Killing off all the [[hawt]] girls you meet along the way unless you are a girl.
*Killing [[God|"God"]] over and over again
*[[Resident Evil 3|Mother fucking camera that would rather focus on your character cowering in a corner than the vomiting epileptic abortions closing in on you.]]
**[[Anus|Rectified]] in ''Home[[cum|coming]]'', except now you can't [[pwn|auto-aim your fucking guns]] at the whole one enemy type and two bosses you need to shoot constantly - basically, still rapes you more than enemies ever could.
*Psychological themes which users on [[GameFAQs]] to write textbooks on using only the knowledge they gained from [[college|community college]] intro to psych classes.
*[[Rape]]
*[[Tentacle rape]]
* Vomiting epileptic abortions that quickly close in on you

==Pyramid Head==
[[Image:Pyramidheadfucked.png|thumb|[[divide by zero|In Soviet Russia, you rape Pyramid Head]]!]]
Even though there are lots and lots of other notable and far more fappable monsters, [[gay|for some reason]], everyone keeps fixated on Pyramid Head. 

Pyramid Head isn't actually all that notable. Did he help torture and keep alive a burn victim in order for a cult to do terrible rites to her? Nope, that was the far sexier nurses. Does he have awesome powers like the power to open the door between world to let the main character go to the "monster side" of silent hill? No, that was valitiel (yes, crank guy has a name)! So, what did Pyramid Head do?

Nothing. He just [[rape]]s shit, [[murder|kills]] shit, then [[anhero]]s.

The only reason anyone noticed him at all is because he's such a strong "male" figure. The [[penis|big fucking knife/sword]] (or [[penis|huge long spear]] in some games) and obvious naked male torso are symbols things that every [[woman]], [[faggot]] and [[gamer|man with a small dick]] want: a huge penis and a nice body. The only reason he has a fandom is because lazy cunts like you don't get off the couch and exercise. Get off your cheeto-stained ass once in awhile and maybe the [[women]] (or [[fag]]s if you swing that way) will be after you instead of some imaginary rape-beast. 

Pyramid Head is also proof of one long disputed truth: everyone likes [[rape]].

==Notable Characters==

[[tl;dr]]: They're all insane except Heather. Heather is the avatar of [[GOD]] and/or [[Sailor Moon]].

<div style="height:200px; overflow:scroll;">
'''[[Retard|Harry Mason]]:''' A 30-something widower, his car gets pwned by Alessa on the highway outside Silent Hill and he is forced to run around for [[at least 100]] hours looking for his lost daughter. He has an extremely short attention span and a one-track mind, often unable to carry on conversations for more than 10 seconds without changing the subject to his daughter, [[shit nobody cares about|who has short, black hair]] and just turned [[lolicon|seven]] [[last Thursday]]. [[Wat|At least that's how it was before Shattered Memories]], [[and fuck you anyway|where they fuck everything up in the story, Harry's dead IRL, and Cheryl's Emo-laced memories are where the game is actually "played" through]].

'''[[Troll|Dahlia]]:''' Disgusting old lady who shouts GYROMANCY at random.

'''[[Chris-Chan|Eddie]]:''' Bastard manchild who is fucking psycho and you kill later, FUCKING EPIC WIN. Kills dogs and randomshit people.

'''[[Resident Evil 4|James Sunderland]]:''' A murderous, bipolar psycho who spends most of his time in Silent Hill dealing with serial rapists, asshole little girls, suicidal teenagers, fat guys, and strippers who look like his dead wife. He gets pwned by a puppy. He wears really shitty boots, and has a 9 year old girl stomp. He's also a fucking dumbass who has a habit of getting outsmarted by an 8 year old girl and saying stupid shit at the wrong time, such as asking a crazy mother fucker who has just killed someone and announced that he'll also kill anyone who makes fun of him if he's gone crazy. There's also the whole "my wife must be alive even though she died because I got a letter from her!" thing he's got going on. Pyramid Head's [[Gay|butt toy]].

'''[[emo|Heather Mason]]:''' By far the [[moron|most intelligent]] character in the entire series, she knows that mixing Acid and Base cleaning products is a recipe for success. Because she's a [[kitchen|woman]], she's considerably piss weak compared to the rest of the Silent Hill protoganists, but is so [[ugly|realistically designed]], she is by far the most [[fantard|loved]]. Heather spends most of her game being knocked up by the Silent Hill Death Cult's demon god, but she takes [[The Matrix|the red pill]] at the end and pukes it out. She also has [[Over 9000]] names and ages, thoughtfully placed in the game to confuse the fuck out of the player. But as she is a hawt chick who [[anime|turns into Sailor Moon and gets a lightsaber]], she is the best character by default.  

'''[[Ugly|Henry Townshend]]:''' A one-dimensional monobrow who spends most of his time [[Stalker|spying on his hot next door neighbor through a hole in the wall]] and bearing witness to lulzy murders. [[Lie|Surprisingly attracts more women than you would think]]. Is the biggest pussy of all [[At least 100|100+]] protagonists, since he never actually has the balls to go to Silent Hill. Walks and runs like a lobotomized polio victim. Is constantly featured in fanfiction, [[In The Ass|getting it up the ass]] by [[Hobo|Walter Sullivan]]. [[Fangirls|Fangirls]] dont realise that it wouldn't ever actually happen, due to Walter's [[Concerned Mother|mother]] watching him.

'''[[Redneck|Travis Grady]]:''' Growing up as basically an orphan was lulzy compared to how he became an orphan. His mom got locked up in an asylum in Silent Hill when she tried to kill him, claiming he was going to be a black person. Then his dad, being a [[Childfree]] parent, [[Haha|hangs himself in their hotel room while his kid is playing vidja gaems and pinball a few doors away]]. Ironically has a Pyramid Head 2.0 called "The Butcher" following him around. Ironic because it's [[O_Rly|really]] him, but because they have a [[LOL WUT|"mirror world"]] in the [[Shortcat|short, short, shoooort]] game he's in, it's actually him from the mirror, but it's his [[cosplay|serial killer persona]].

'''[[Batshit|Alex Shepherd]]:''' [[Army|An Americunt soldier]] coming back from a war to see his seriously fucked-up family in a town named after his [[KKK|great-great-great-great-Grand Dragon]]. Occasionaly accompanied by a black person and some [[Kitchen|stupid blonde bitch]], he eventually turns into [[shota]]-chaser, looking for his younger brother in a movie-to-game-fan-fiction that rings something like ''[[cult|Children of the Corn]]''.  Oh, and it turns out he was actually imagining everything, because he killed his fucking brother over a [[Mordor|ring]], and he's only picturing this whole [[fanfic|story]] to not realize he's [[Lulz|getting the ever-loving shit shocked out of him in a psych-ward]], unless you get the [[Lame|good]] ending, in which he never realizes he's [[Batshit|mentally unstable]].
