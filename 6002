In neo-[[Netspeak]], showing [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] emphasis is key.  Fake excitement and rip-offs of [[eBay]]-style feedback are commonplace, as well as making fun of how [[newbies|n00bs]] talk of their own volition and how they are inspired to try to talk [[Leet|l33t]] even though they are un-l33t.  In this form of punctuation, exclamation marks are repeated a lot, but there's a PHUNNY! twist. It's as if someone got a little too enthusiastic and lost control of their [[shift key]]; it goes from being a series of exclamation marks to being a series of exclamation marks either terminated with trailing "1"s, or interspersed with them.  

[[Anonymous|Advanced users]] will recognize the opportunity to embellish this further; as in [[Netspeak]], the most elegant or flagrantly [[troll|abusive]] style wins, and doing something '''moar''' is a sign that you are obviously smarter and cooler than everyone else.  In this case, the super-cool will have occurrences of the word "one". [[Fuck]], if [[you]]'re really [[cool]], type the word "eleven" (anything past eleven [i.e one-hundred-and-eleven] is [[Fail|zero times funny]]). If a statement is read aloud which is punctuated in this manner, the individual "!"s and "1"s should be read aloud as "bang"(or in the case of normal English speakers, "Exclamation mark" or "Factorial" for mathfags) and "one" respectively, and anything mixed in should be read aloud, unless it is "I'm a [[Idiot|dumbass]]."  The series of [[Furries|characters]] should almost always end with a word for the number 1, or with a "1".

The expression gained notoriety in the Arfenhouse series of [[flash]] films, in which various characters spoke in a bastardized form of [[l33t]]. However, given that Arfenhouse hasn't been popular for the past five years and [[Lie|its creator killed himself]], there is some confusion as to why the trend continues.

== Other Forms Too Advanced For You ==
* Use !!!!111! or any other variant, but not because you are actually making a mistake or trying to be funny or making fun of people trying to be funny.  Instead you are using it to make fun of people making fun of people trying to be funny, thus demonstrating how cool and hip and seasoned you are.  This is an example of [[irony|Hipster Irony]].  Warning:  Only use this if you truly have your finger on the pulse of internet high society.
* Add in a dictionary definition of the word 'one', eg 'The ordinarily of an element which has no predecessor; usually called first' or The cardinality of the smallest nonempty set. The number of heads a typical human has.'
* Try throwing in other numbers, 5 seems to be popular.
* If you are in extreme [[LOL|LOLgasm]], a 2 or @ [[a cat is fine too|is fine too]]. [[disregard that, I suck cocks|Disregard that,]] [[Futurama|twos don't exist]].
* Throw in a word to prove just how [[Unfunny|hilariously random]] and [[Fucktard|silly]] you are.  !!!!!!!11111221111!!!
* Spell out eleven instead of just one.
* Use 111111111111 to signify your presumption that all caps mode amounts to permanent shift key activation.
* Use "shift+1", which is how you actually make a "!". !!!11shift+1!1oneone
* Add question marks and forward-slashes (???????////)
* Throw in some "uno"s and "eins"s to show how smrt u r.
* To be a [[wanker|total wanker]], spell out "exclamation mark" repeatedly as opposed to "one". (e.g. !!!exclamationmarkexclamationmarkexcamationmark1111).
* If you are [[mexican|spanish]], be sure to include some upside-down ones in the beginning of your sentence: ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡əuoəuoəuo
* Another popular method is adding "eleventy-one" or "eleventy" a la [[Homosexual|Bilbo Baggins]], i.e. !!!!11!!eleventy-one!!
* Use cos(0), sin(90), tan(45), ''e''^0, log(10), ln(''e''), -''e''^(''i''*pi), or [[Wikipedia:Proof that 0.999... equals 1|0.999...]] all of which are equal to 1.  MIND HURTS.
* Include directions on how to draw a certain character. For example, replace "1" with "Draw a single vertical line with a 225° line protruding from the top point and a smaller horizontal line intersecting perpendicular to the bottom the point, and repeat this process multiple times".
* Explain how one can write 1, such as "With your index finger, tap the '1' button near the top-left of your keyboard gently, and repeat in accordance to desired quantity"
* Explain "1" in further detail, such as "number which precedes 2 and exceeds 0", or "smallest odd number which is a multiple of itself only yet is not prime". Be as retarded as you like.
* Write an enyclopedia article describing the entire process, or, better yet, add an irrelevant, last-word, ultimately self-referential comment to a pre-existing example of such, or hey, even a last-word AFTER a last-word (repeat the cycle).
* Add a ZOMGGGGGZZZZ onto the end for more emphasis.
* Add the letter V after [[cuntpasting]] something many times. Implies you let go of the Ctrl key before the V. Example: "duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck vvv"
* Add a random obscure Unicode symbol, example: zomg!!!11!۩!1 <i> No, use </i> [[卐|卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐]]
* The expression (10^large-1)/9, which is written in base-10 as a string of 1s with length large (implicitly presumed to be an integer).
* FFFFFFFF, which is hex for a 32-bit string of 1s.
* Write "1" in 1337 as 0|\|3 or even 23|&0 |>1|>3 |=0|&\/\/4|&|) 5|_45# |>1|>3 7#|&33
* Don't write anything.

== As part of username on [[LiveJournal]] ==

For a while, putting a 1 in front of pretty much anything was a trendy way to make [[1justin]] [[parody accounts]] on [[LJ]] ([http://www.livejournal.com/users/1ruxpin/ 1ruxpin], [http://www.livejournal.com/users/1jameth/ 1jameth], [http://www.livejournal.com/users/1jewstein/ 1jewstein], etc.). Most of them were [[unfunny]] and [[1justin]] had several of them suspended. [[LJ Abuse]] didn't really seem to have any rhyme nor reason behind which ones they'd suspend and which ones they wouldn't.
