Post ending in XXX
{{stub}}

On February 21st, 2010, [[moot]] and his [[4chan]]  [[mods|cancer research team]] abandoned [[chemo]] in favour of surgery to stem the flow of [[post ending in|malignant tumours]] that have rendered /[[b]]/ and /[[v]]/ all but brain dead over the last several years.

==The Procedure==

[[File:Post_ending_in_chemo_PM.png|900px|center|thumb|'''FINALLY!''' [[moot]] [[chemo|surgically reconstructs]] post number endings to [[xxx]].]]
[[File:Post_ending_in_xxx51_PM.png|300px|thumb|WIN/WIN]]
By lopping the last three digits off of [[post]] numbers and replacing them with '''[[xxx]]''', he has hopefully stemmed the flow of shitposts including -but not limited to- such [[newfag]] faves as:

*[[Post ending in (x)]]
*[[Doubles]]
*[[Post ending in 75 Girl]]

From now on, [[Post_ending_in_(x)_gets_to_name_my_(x)|your dog is called '''xxx''']] and you will kill yourself by '''xxx'''.

==To Be Continued?==

What remains remarkably stunning to this very day is just how resourceful the retards at /b/ are at taking anything you hand them and shitting it up in ways unimaginable. The latest installment of [[The Chemo That Is Curing /b/]] backfired spectacularly, and moot simply traded in "Post ending in" number threads for "Post ending in XXX" faggery daggery doo. Just minutes after implementation [http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/69593 a new script] emerged which reverses the effect anyways.

==Conclusion, Aftermath==

Post ending in XXX is even more annoying than [[Newfags_can't_triforce|Triforcecirclejerking]].

Example given:
<pre>
Newfag:Herp I just googled how I triforce can, now I go troll fellow Newfags with it.
Other Newfag:Herp, triforce I canÂ´t, Imma going to google it and troll other newfags afterwards. Derp.
...
</pre>

==/v/ gets it==
On April 23, 2010, [[moot]] added post number truncating to /v/.
