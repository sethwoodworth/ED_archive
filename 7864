Stu makes chocolate pudding at 4 in the morning
[[Image:Chocolatepudding11.jpg|thumb|right|/v/ being /v/.]]
'''Stu makes chocolate pudding at 4 in the morning''' and all its variants are part of an old, [[exploitable]] clip from [[Rugrats]]. This fad started out on [[YouTube]] in early 2010, soon finding its way onto the boards of [[4chan]],  probably originating from [[co/|/co/]] in May where for days it was perpetually posted at 4:00am, and eventually becoming a [[meme]] after floating around   [[retard|summer]] [[v/|/v/]]. Why they are posting old clips of Rugrats nobody knows, but it's [[lie|probably video game related]].

In the clip, Stu is caught making chocolate pudding because he [[emo|lost control of his life]]. Stu then ends up getting [[IRL]] [[trolled]] by Angelica leaving him in a fit of [[rage]].

There are epic Stu threads in the [http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/dspl_thread.php5?thread_id=16830211&x=Stu archive].

The clip is from an episode where Angelica fakes getting a broken leg for attention. Stu feels bad about Angelica breaking her leg in his house, so she stays over there and he waits on her hand and foot. 

Thanks to Anon, [[Akinator]] will correctly guess the pudding that Stu made at 4am.
