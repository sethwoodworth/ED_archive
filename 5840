Not Jewish

A common term used by people accused of being Jewish. Often used with remarks such as [[A Game of Pretend|"Jews don't exist"]] and [[Bullshit|"looks or names can't be connected to ethnicity in any meaningful way"]], as though having a hook-shaped nose is not reason enough to be sent to a concentration camp.

Examples:
*"I myself am not Jewish, but I'm afraid of Germans."
*"I'm not Jewish, but I hate bald white people."
*"I'm not Jewish, but I hate [[Arab|Arabs!]]"
*"[[Linda Mack]] is not Jewish."
*"Don't talk about my mother like that."
*"Anyone could be an expert on stock exchange."
*A: "I can't smell it." B: "I hate bagels."
*"The people on [[the Wikipedia Jews|this list]] do not consider themselves Jewish."
*"I'm not Jewish, but [[not racist|I have Jewish friends/a Jewish girlfriend]]."
*"Court has ruled [[consensus]] that this person is not Jewish."
*"All they did was kill the saviour of mankind, what's the big deal?"
**<s>Because if they didn't kill the savior of mankind, there would BE no savior of mankind. No crucifixion, no Christianity. You should be THANKING Judas.</s>
**<s>Jesus was Jewish himself, so they just killed one of their own, and at that time, Christians were a cult of Judaism.</s> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]].

==Optional Euphemism: "secular" Jew(ish)==
Examples:
*"The Hollywood/San Fernando Valley Pornography Industry is dominated by secular Jews."
*"[[Aliza Shvarts]] is a secular Jew."
*"My maternal grandmother is Jewish."
*"I converted to Judaism, but the rabbi told me to GTFO! I flunked the test. Those college educated Jews always get the right answers."
*PC doublespeak time : "After the attacks on 9/11, Jewish Americans oppose the harsh treatment, xenophobia and media vilification of Arab Americans, American Muslims and South Asians in this country".

==Fact Of The Day==
[[File:Racial.jpg|thumb|No link at all.]]
The Nazis defined a Jew as anyone who either 1) had three or four racially full Jewish grandparents, 2) belonged to a Jewish religious community or joined one after September 15 when the Nuremberg Laws came into force or 3) [[Tom Cruise|had a big nose]]. Definition 3) has since been inducted into the Library Of Congress [[uncyclopedia|Archive Of Classic Jokes]].
