Just as angels fell down from heaven, dramacrats and sysops have failed the lulz and had their positions...terminated. Once trusted with the most important duties on the Wiki, their innate faggotry, fail, and unwarranted self-importance would always surface leading to bannation, or worse exile to Wikipedia.

==Hall of Shame==
All of the below were also disgraced [[ED Government|ED sysops]] except as noted:

===Ex-Sysops===
*'''[[A RAPE SPIDER]] (aka [[User:Sokevinsays|Sokevinsays]])''' - Pissing off [[Girlvinyl]] via [[ED:Lulzcon 07 planning|Lulzcon 07]].
*'''[[The Arguecat Weightloss Challenge|Arguecat]]''' - "An annoying, entitled, whiny, self-righteous cunt." - Girlvinyl
*'''[[User:Aussieintn|Aussieintn]]''' - Being [[Jacknstock]], see below
*'''[[user:Bastardman|Bastardman]]''' - Fell deeply in love with the [[delete fucking everything|delete button]].
*'''[[ByAppointmentTo]]''' - [[Facefag]]ging other sysops on the [[Wikipedia Review]], threatening to get on a plane and fight Ajt and being a chubby chaser. 
*'''[[User:Divx-Mongool|Divx-Mongool]]''' - For being [[Dutch|unfunny]].
*'''[[Jacknstock]]''' - Attempted [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|coup of the wiki]].
*'''[[User:Januszeal|Januszeal]]''' - Started his own [[chatnets|IRC network]] when [[ED IRC]] was down that became home to over 9000 /[[i]]/nsurgents including [[Anonymous Borg|a bunch of raidfags]] who used it as a launchpad for a [[DDoS]] attack on [[ED]] and [[brb, soup|all manner of faggotry]]. He was subsequently forgiven but not reinstated to Sysop Valhalla. Can be found running shit at [[partyvan.info]].
*'''[[User:Lmte|Lmte]]''' - Fell deeply in love with the [[ban hammer]], refused to help users and went on a [[dox]]ing rampage.
*'''[[User:Pokchu|Pokchu]]''' - [[13-year-old boy|His parents]] got sued over an [[Robert Pierson|article]] he wrote, later sold out ED to [[r9k]].
*'''[[The Missing Talk Page Of VandalFucker|VandalFucker]]''' - Being a faggot and acting like a hybrid of Jacknstock and [[Miltopia]], instead of the cool way he was when he was [[User:Voronic|Voronic]] where he had [[moonspeak|the most wonderful way of talking]].
*'''[[WKD]]''' - [[Pool's closed]] due to [[Yiri]].
*'''[[Zaiger]]''' - Desysopped mainly because [[Yiri]] and [[Penni]] threatened to [[Done with ED|leave ED]] forevar if [[TFO]] didn't desysop him. However there was also abundant self-importance, hostility to other admins, and being a jerk to users. It takes real effort to stand out for being a jerk to users on ED btw, although if he was a TOW sysop he would've gotten away with it.  See [[Ryulong]], [[MONGO]], [[SlimVirgin]], and [[Jayjg]] articles. Zaiger however pulled a [[KOTOR|Revan]] and became the first formerly disgraced sysop to get [[Vox Dramatica|VD]] in December of [[2010]].

===Never Sysops===
*'''[[User:Blargh|Blargh]]''' - ED's very own Cartman, was banned for being from Bakersfield, California.
*'''[[User:Core|Core]]''' - Never officially [[b&]], Core left the building with [[User:Januszeal|Januszeal]] to form what became [[chatnets|partyvan]] IRC. Core was actually supposed to be a Sysop but somehow pissed [[Weev]] off and was told [[tits or GTFO|that unless he submitted 20 pix of real girls with '''"loldongs"''' written on their tits he would be denied the banhammer]]. Being from Ireland, the pickings were [[fugly|slim]] and not to Weev's liking so Core kept getting rejected and told to get [[moar]]. Core then founded [http://www.chansluts.com Chansluts] to deliver said titpics and deliver they did. However since he'd cast his lot with Januszeal, he ended up leaving without ever having wielded the almighty [[banhammer]].
*'''[[User:EDS1|EDS1]]''' - The girl pretending to be 3 girls who made up The [[ED Singers]]. At first she was some silly kid singing songs about lolcattle over [[Jpop|Japanese pop karaoke tracks]]. Eventually she was given a minor privilege by the SysOps in order to make her feel welcomed. However, her [[USI]] grew to an unmanageable size and she tried to [[take down ED]] with a [[lolsuit]] directed at someone nobody cares about. Touchæ [[Bellofatass|Alexandra]], touchæ indeed.
*'''[[Grawp]] / [[JarlaxleArtemis]]'''  - Jeremy [[GTFO|got run off]] ED by dissident [[Wikipedophile|Wikipedo]]s, ditched by [[EDiot]]s for being [[unfunny]] [[old meme]] and was finally found to have been [[ED:VIP|vandalizing]] ED for [[at least 100]] years. Ended up [[facefag]]ging ED sysops in his final moments of [[Fail|glory]] here.
*'''[[User:Habermann|Habermann]]''' - Had a vast amount of [[USI]] claiming to be the true voice of Encyclopedia Dramatica, tried to [[shameless self-promotion|promote his own site]] many times, being Lmte’s tool and buttbuddy and ranted about how weeaboos and furfags were covertly taking over ED. Whether he was an [[asshole]] or [[martyr]]ed himself fighting a desperate attempt to stem the weeaboo invasion is for you to decide. Supposedly, he was going to rub it in [[User:Cash|Cash]]'s face but never got the chance.
*'''[[User:Iheartchu|Matty]]''' - Pretended to be superior to everyone else, was a total [[trying too hard|sycophant]] to every sysop ever, faked being drunk on the IRC channel, and tried too hard to become a sysop. Also shitted up a fuck tonne of [[talk page]]s with bored rantings.  Also, on a weekly, or sometimes daily, basis, attempted to have cybersex with several members of [[ED irc]], including [[yiri]], which got old pretty fast.
*'''[[Miltopia]]'''  - Deported to his homeland of [[Wikipedia]], where he was executed [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/f/fd/MiltopiaAnHero.JPG for treason] by [[Jimbo Wales]].
*'''[[PirateSmackK]]''' - Did something that was kind of sort of almost funny on [[TOW]] once and it went straight to his head. Constantly autofellated on ED and eventually went mad when [[no one cares|no one cared]] about him. Provides real sysops with hundreds of proxies to ban.
*'''[[RedMachineD]]''' - Threatened to machinegun [[Lulzcon]] ([[Srs|Seriously]]). {{ytlink|4yk-ESYl7Bc|This is him doing DDR}}
*'''[[Samsara]]''' - Not laughing at [[loldongs]].
*'''[[User:Thayo|Thayo]]''' - Outsourced to [[disney|disney.com]].
*'''[[User:Tomoe|Tomoe]]''' - A [[weeaboo]], [[Bokuchan]] admin, and supposedly a one-year veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He read through the entire wiki and constantly quoted old memes on the IRC; also had a fetish for [[1guy1jar]]. Banned for "excessive faggotry, shitposting, *chan bullshit, and crimes against humanity" - [[Killhamster]].
*'''[[User:Zen444|Zen]]''' - Being [[unfunny]].
