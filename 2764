Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed
[[Image:ExpelledPedoPoster.jpg|300px|thumb|Ben Stein is catering to the [[Pedophile|target audience]] and graffiting what appears to be writing on an already [[retard|illiterate]] school. Dressed like a [[Rape|schoolboy]] to attract his target audience, [[Pedophiles|catholic priests]].]]

'''''Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed''''' is a "documentary" (moar like comedy, [[amirite]]?) created by an Epic Jew[[fail]], [[Republican|conservative]] '''Ben Stein'''<sup>[[✡]]</sup>, on how scientists are discriminating against [[redneck|inbred hicks]] for their belief in the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]] and that believing in evolution caused [[The Holocaust]], [[Communism|Stalinism]] and jock itch. It'll make you want to [[Win|burn down churches]] while aborting [[White_trash|your fifth biracial pregnancy]].

[[Faggot|PZ Myers]] along with his [[BFF]] [[Richard Dawkins]] went to see a private screening of the film as they were both in it, and in an absolute [[lulz|twist of irony]], Myers was kicked out of the movie and then [[butthurt|blogged about it]].

''Expelled'' flopped in theaters, making something like 4 million dollars over 3 weekends, which is not a [[profit]] when you take marketing and distribution costs into account. The makers of the movie are now getting [[desperate]] and pleading with their [[sheep|loyal fans]] to go watch the [[shit|movie]] again and again and again and again and again.

==OMG SCIENCE DID WTC==
Ben Stein decided that science is responsible for [[lolwut|all bad things evar]]. He has been quoted as saying:

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">When we just saw that man, I think it was Mr. Myers, talking about how great scientists were, I was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw [[hitler|scientists]] telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get [[Holocaust|gassed]] … that was [[LOL|horrifying beyond words]], and that’s where science — in my opinion, this is just an opinion — [[LOL WUT|that’s where science leads you]].</blockquote>

Never mind that [[JEWS DID WTC|extremely pious people crashed passenger jets into buildings]] and bomb abortion clinics.

According to Stein, science is a business comparable to market brokerage, which is why it's called "big science" in the same context of "big business". A scientist who spent his life savings on grad school is as greedy as [[Lyor Cohen]], and schools that don't base their curricula on Abrahamic myths are violating your [[civil rights]].
