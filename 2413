[[File:Draconas' Fursona.jpg|thumb|right|Off to a bad start...]]

Every now and then, somebody gets a golden opportunity and completely blows it. '''Draconas Rayne''' is one of those people. The original catalyst for the epic shitstorm that made an [[Wolfeedarkfang|Internet Superstar]] out of [[Conner Hemming]], Draconas had a perfect chance to have his faggotry completely ignored by the masses and slink away an unknown. Unfortunately for him, he is a furry, and that whole [[Common sense|"Shut up now to avoid consequences later"]] thing isn't really big amongst his people.

==[[Trying Too Hard|FAGconas the FAGGOT FAG FAG FAG]]==

Draconas lived by most means, a boring existence. Commonly seen among [[Wolfeedarkfang|Wolfee Darkfang]] and his [[Second Life]] chums, [[Tamias the Chipmunk]] and [[Cid Silverwing]], for years he had a front row seat to many a juicy internet drama, be it zoophile, DMCA, or dead Grandpa related. Yet [[Impossible|somehow]], unlike many of his friends, didn't find himself immediately compelled to join the parade of failure whenever the various e-drama occurred. Indeed it seemed, no matter how prevalent, Draconas did what many furries dreamed of but very few ever do; kept his faggot e-drama limited to those involved. One [[Shit nobody cares about|very bad break up later]] however, that self restraint was no more.

===Enter Hemming===

[[Nobody Cares|While the earlier history is somewhat sketchy]], at some point Draconas began dating his once friend-then enemy-then apparent friend again [[Conner Hemming]]. While then, an unknown among non-[[sick fucks|macro/foot fetish furries]] raged for being a dramawhore of the highest caliber and getting his ass [[banned]] from everywhere for everything, all the time. Draconas, now deeply in love, wasn't having that shit and immediately joined his new buttbuddy in rousing sessions of [[BAWWW|"Let's Go Complain About The Admins"]] between their repeated cybersexing. Things went well, but soon Draconas' [[waambulance|crybaby]] antic took their toll, and he too got the [[b&|banhammer]] for his douchebaggery. This he deemed unconscionable, and thus did what he did best; bitched about the injustice to people who didn't care.

===Draconas Is Surprised That Dating a Dramawhore Brings Him Drama===

In events that were [[Boring|never interesting enough to research]], at some point the fairytale romance turned sour and Conner decided to exact [[Lulz|terrible revenge]] against his former love. While doing the usual method of half assed trolling via Second Life and YouTube seemed to be getting the job done throughly enough, making Draconas quite [[butthurt|upset]], Conner got greedy and decided he wanted a truly delicious victory in order to cover up some of his own [[failure]]s. He hurried off to [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] and plastered a shitload of [[Uncyclopedia|boring, vague, and unfunny factoids]] about Draconas all over [[Portal:Furfaggotry/Needed|the Needed page]] for ED's Furry portal. This pissed Draconas off something fierce, and, had he stopped there, he probably could have been considered a pretty [[successful troll]]. The little shit got greedy however, and decided Draconas really, really needed himself an Encyclopedia Dramatica page and decide to [[Writing Yourself Into An Article|push his boring bullshit into everybody's face]] until he himself was trolled and made into a lolcow.

Then he just got pissed off and made it himself.

For the most part, it seemed Draconas lucked out. His would-be harasser, now a disgraced lolcow faggot, tried in vain to defend himself from the [[Anonymous]] onslaught. All he had to do was [[GTFO|fuck off]] and Conners poorly thought out vanity page would be flushed therefore having his own name forgotten to the ages. Sadly, his behavior afterwards made it perfectly clear why he was banging Conner in the first place.

===Draconas Digs The Hole Deeper===
[[File:Draconas'DeathThreat.jpg|thumb|right|Draconas [[U Mad|slightly angry]].]]
Opting to do [[Reverse trap|the exact opposite]] of what any other person would have done, Draconas took Conners very poor trolling and proceeded to whine and complain about it everywhere. YouTube, Fur Affinity, even Second Life forums fell victim to Draconas' rage over the article. He promised his former fling a swift and brutal death. Barring that, [[lawlsuit|legal action]]. Yes, from shamelessly moaning and whining to pointless [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|vandalism]], Draconas took his golden opportunity to escape Anons' attention and proceeded to make himself an even bigger target, as Conners elementary trolling was more than enough to send him into [[Nerd Rage|a frenzy]]. His efforts proved worthless, and earned him a full Encyclopedia Dramatica page.

===Conner and Draconas Waste Everybodys Time===
A month later, reports were that Conner and Draconas had [[cybersex|kissed and made up]], and other dreadful case of the furry drama behind them, rendering the week long e-war entirely meaningless. Unfortunately Anonymous [[Rules of the internet|does not forgive or forget]], so their faggotry is documented for all of you to enjoy as a frightening consequence of furfaggotry. Never fret though, we're sure they'll keep the fun going [[Forever Alone|for a good, long while]].
