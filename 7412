Shakakuskeeper

Shakakuskeeper is a user on deviantART, also known as the cancer that is killing the internet. Her comics consist of showing everyone [http://shakakuskeeper.deviantart.com/art/Hangover-A-Cartoon-Short-102990744 how people feel waking up next to her], and giving [[*chan]] a reason to [[troll]]. She appears to have the mindset that everyone actually gives a [[fuck]] about her, which brings more [[lulz]] to this already [[lulzy]] situation.

==Drama llama's in action.==

[[Shit nobody cares about|One day, Shakakuskeeper had the gall to insult the great Amberanime's magnificent MSPaint recolors of official Kingdom Hearts character art. It was a small, straight-to-the-point comment, but Amberanime threw a shit fit and  deleted fucking everything, as well as comment on Shakakuskeeper's art, telling her that it "stinks" and "doesn't deserve to be on DA". This is particularly lulzy because Amberanime's gallery consists of bullshit drawings of animu characters on lined paper. Amberanime also went on to say that she only "stinks at redone pics", which in basic English, translates to "shitty MSPaint official character recolors".]]

==Lol, Update==

It seems Amberanime felt remorse over her act of insane assbaggery and apologized!
