Twice
'''Twice''' is defined as once more than once and once less than thrice (also called "three times"). If you've done something twice you're either a big fan of it or just really stupid.

Twice can also be used as an intensifier for threats, especially if you're an [[Internet tough guy]]: "Listen, asshole, if you cross me again I'll kill you - ''twice''."
