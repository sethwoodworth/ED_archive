Digimon Battle
Once upon a time [[last thursday]], a [[azn|Korean]] company by the name of WeMade made (lol irony) created a faggy [[furry]] free MMO called Digimon Battle. And all was good. But in the shadows of the forums, something evil was brewing.
And then anon found it and fed those trolls until the Azn game makers threw a rage fit.

==In the beginning==

The game at first attracted the bored and the young, or at least those adults down the end of your street that never seem to leave their house and spend all day smelling of jizz (and you know this because you've been in their house because of promises of candy).
Due to their fail, WeMade released the download before the actual game started, causing much butthurt among players that would have to actually wait and do something constructive with their time that isn't spam attacking weakling noobs that don't realise that the level 21 [[digimon]] will kick your fucking ass.
But the forums were still there. Anon saw and it was good.
When downloading the game servers, various different times were recorded, ranging between ten minutes and two days. In the Phillipines, it was the worst. And that was when the wars started.

==Race Wars and anon==

Deep in the depths of the forums, a troll by the name of ArcAngelArtemis began the epic trolling of the spanish speakers (mainly Brazilians). It's not known exactly how he did it, but ever since the first server became active, the shout chat feature has been spammed by "BRBRBRBRBRBRBRBR!!!!!!1!!!!"
Shout chat is only available to 'brave tamers' so you can tell just how sad these people are by the first people to shout on that eventful day.
The Americans grew so tired of the Brazilian's fucktarded bullshit, that they began responding with hordes of "ENGENGENGENGENG"

<strike>Triple A hasn't been seen on the forums since, reports say he's grinding his [[furry|renamon]]'s level until he can get it to look like that hot chick in armour to fap to it without him feeling like a furry.</strike> Disregard that I suck cocks, he's back.

===The AIDs is spreading to other servers===

As of recently, anon has reported that the internet backwash of hate has drifted onto the other servers. The Brazilian trolls can be told apart from the rest of the only-slightly-less-sad community by their usernames, that always always always end in BR.
Their failfag trolling tactics include going up to a random newbie going "oi" and as soon as they respond going "br????"

==Quotes of rage==

{{quote|They do not believe they are in the wrong. One idiot went ,"We can speak what we want. Dont like it? too bad" and he also went ,"Racism is against the rules. Break it? get banned." when someone asked him to speak in english. l0lpl0x?


tl;dr version : They should all be IP banned for real if they dont listen :3| lot's of love, AngryGuy <3}}

{{quote|[[nazi|Not to mention there's players running around saying hail brazil! bow down to brazil! brazil is best!]]|Lol racism at it's best}}

{{quote|If THIS is what the BR's count as common courtesy, I'm putting my PK gauntlets on >.>}}

{{quote|True, but when 90% of it will then be retarded Americans, that's just as bad.|Angry BR?}}

{{quote|
No I Wont. All Games Are IP Blocked For A Reason. This Game Needs One. And I Dont Need To "Grow Up", Im Simply Trying To Get An IP Block So The War Between BR`s And Americans Will End And We Americans Can Play In Peace.|ChibixRiku, the most hated guy on the forums}}

==ChibixRiku==

[[weaboo|Chibi]] is the self appointed "Most Hated User On The Forums" due to the ridiculous amounts of threads he's created simply to bash the Brazilian's and call for an IP block.

{{quote|[[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|Learn how to capitalize and contract first in your native language]], then scold people for their poor communicational skills in their second language, will you?|It's true, everyone hates him}}

He hates all other languages except for English, which he can't even use properly himself.

{{quote|English is the only language  that counts. If you don't speak it, it means you are a terrorist.|Direct from ED, clearly he's been reading}}

{{quote|
People Are ALways Going To Want An IP Block. The War Is NOT In My Mind. Its On Shout Chat Every Day,And On The Forums 24/7. So Its Definetly NOT In My Mind. And 90% Of Brazillians Are. Btw Will You Stop Posting In That Annoying Non-English Language? Its Gaudying Up My Thread. And Gonzo I Can Post However The Hell I Want As Long As Its In English And NOT ALL CAPS. (: Kay? Mkay. <3|that was French they were speaking}}

And thus they decided to use binary instead. Or Klingon, that's been seen too. And Pig Latin, they used that too.

{{quote|You are so right. EVERYONE should speak ENGLISH as we are SUPERIOR. Since when exactly has Canada been apart of America? Who cares if there are more languages out there? The majority of them are just clicking sounds that seem made up. Well if its an American server then people should be speaking english. Otherwise they should go attempt to play the other versions where everyone else harldy speaks english.|Wow someone agrees with him}}

{{quote|The French in this topic are easier to understand than you... And I know VERY little French}}

{{quote|    "L'Amérique du Nord ? Ainsi dans votre esprit fait qui incluent le Canada ? De la manière que vous allez sur environ ceci, mon Français devrait être proscrit également. Est-ce que c'est ce que vous voulez ?"



Никто не хочет слышать ваш французский так или иначе.|most awesome trolling of his post yet.}}

===Anonther Phillipene rage fit and ingame prostitution===

Pheonix actually commented long before the rage fit saying that it was only a joke and apologized, jackie03 continues to flame even after this.

{{quote|Who the hell is this CHIBIXRIKU! are you saying pheonix is the bad guy now! we know who pheonix is personally we belong to the same shop and we go to the same school he's not that kind of person the one's that comments are just his followers here in the shop including me! its just very unfair for pheonix to be treated that way and i say i will be there to hunt chibixriku down when jackie03 says so he's so pissed of about what happened and seriously speaking pheonix is a good guy its just that a person just took it down with bad intentions! there's 37 of us here at the school that is playing digimon and we all play at 1 shop and theyre pretty pissed of at chibixriku because he doesn't know the whole story!Im pissed off at chibiriku too with that saying i hate him! i wish chibixriku will just stop at being such a loser!!!!!!!|jackie03 again, no one quite knows what they're talking about when they say 'shop'}}

==And so WeMade go batshit==

Being tired of the trolling of the poor widdle BRs, WeMade introduced a filter to the ENGLISH language. Only the English at first, the moved onto a few Spanish words.
So far ingame you can't say:
#Ish
#Wish
#English
#Spanish (Hell, anything with ish in it)
#If agumon (Because of the word fag in there)
#Amusement (Because of the word semen)
#Small (Because it has SM in it)
#Sad
#Pretty much all of the digimon's names
#Japanese
#This
#Damn (But not dammit)
#Jews
#Smart
#Isn't it (Because of the word tit in there)
#And almost all of the normal swearwords. But not Fuck, Bitch, ass or I like to sleep with fat women. (Lol actual quote)

And screw is still useable too.


===Happy Hour===

It's just as dumb as it sounds. Happy hour is an hour every day when people's exp gain goes up by 30%, this is when all of those SOOPER SRS TAMERS come out to mass train their furries. People bitched.

PARTICULARLY.. LOOK AT MY LOCATION ON THE MAP!

.. CANCEL.. THIS. EVENT.. OR RELEASE MORE LEVEL 40 AREAS!}}

{{quote|Since I don't think either is likely, did you try moving further into the labyrinth?}}

===Capture rates and levels===

Simply put, everyone complained about it being too easy to level up and capture those cute little blobby things, so WeMade raised the rates, so people complained that the rates were too high[http://forums.wemade.net/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5619]

It seems those poor Azns can't do anything right any more.
