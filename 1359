'''Casey Brezik''' was a junior college student at Metropolitian Community College-Penn Valley, and self described Anarchist, originally from Greene County, [[Missouri]]. (Technically, Sprinfield.)  Brezik's attempt at IRL trolling was unusually poor for a troll in [[Kansas City]], and should not be counted against the city's trolling reputation.

== The Event ==
As a possible sign that most people don't know who their current state governor is, Brezik felt the need to [[anarchy|take down the establishment]] [[for the lulz|for no particular reason]] and [http://www.kansascity.com/2010/09/15/2227388/nixon-was-intended-target-of-assailant.html attempt to assassinate Missouri Governor Jay Nixon] (no relation to that other [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]) on September 14, 2010.

Because of Brezik's [[schizophrenia]] (which was diagnosed about 4 years ago) and police record full of civil disobedience charges, there was no way in hell that he was going to be approved for a state gun license. So, like any good would-be assassin, he improvised and went with the simple method: a knife.

After putting on a bulletproof vest (because he knew that the po-po would be giving him a much deserved beating), Brezik though he had the perfect plan. Or so he though.

Brezik hid in a hallway waiting for Governor Nixon and his entourage to walk down the hall. Weilding the knife, Brezik stabbed somone in the neck who was walking down the hall who he though was Governor Nixon.  Instead, [[FAIL|he had stabbed one of the deans at the community college]].

When the police interrigated Brezik, he stated that he did not know who Jay Nixon was except for being a person who had some political power (as if any State Governor has it in the first place). He also said he was disappointed that the man that he stabbed was not the governor.

Brezik should have plenty of time to know who the state governor is in prison, because because of his [[mental illness]] it may seem that he might just get another crack at the the Governor.  With any luck, he will stab Lieutenant Governor [[Peter Kinder]] instead.  Ironically, Kinder nothing but [[BAWWWWW]] about how Nixon cut out his statewide bicycle race pet project for things like the Missouri Department of Mental Health and the new federal healthcare system implemented by Black Jesus.
