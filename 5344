'''Miami''' is the largest city in Cuba and the sixth largest city in [[Latin#Latin America|Latin America]]. It is named after an [[India]]n tribe from Ohio (go figure). Some [[jews|old people]] still continue to claim that Miami is actually a part of South [[Florida]] but they merely suffer from [[Alzheimers]] disease. It is [[common knowledge]] that the city has been ruled by Cubans since [[Fidel Castro]] conquered it in the Bay of [[Pig]]s Invasion of 1961.

==Demographics==

80[[%]] of Miami's population is Cuban while another 18[[%]] consists of [[Haiti]]ans, whom like to steal people's stuff. The remaining 2[[%]] of people live in either Pinecrest (all [[rich and beautiful]] upper-middle class [[Jews]]) or Homestead (all [[aids|black]]s, [[rape|Mexican]]s and [[republicans|redneck]]s). Miami's official language is [[Spanish]], although [[French|Haitian Creole]] comes quite close as well. [[American language|American]] is also spoken as a second language by a sub-significant minority of the population.

==History==
Miami was shortly colonized [[at least 100]] years ago by [[Jews]] from [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]] who were too lazy to switch time zones for the beautiful scenic beaches in [[Hawaii]] or the polluted coast of [[California]]. From this, Miami has evolved from a crime-ridden city to a black person with with a [[gay|rich]] area called "South Beach", in which only tourists and [[gay]]s go there.

==Climate and Geography==

Miami has 2 seasons: summer and hurricane. Miami gets up to [[42]]00 inches of rain each year and virtually every day the sky is cloudy. Despite this, Florida is still called the "Sunshine State".

Due to its location next to the Everglades swampland, Miami is filled with stray crocodiles and alligators, thus, you can even find them in your own backyard. Because whiny [[hippies|environmentalist]] [[leftard]]s have placed them on the Endangered Species List, crocodiles cannot be harmed by law, with possible punishment by [[death]] (thus putting them in higher importance than Haitian immigrants). Alligators, on the other hand, are plentiful and are free to be killed and sold in the market for a penny each. In fact, one of Jeb Bush's major campaign promises in 2002 was guaranteeing "a gator in every pot".

Miami is also well known for its beautiful, scenic beaches. Many [[unemployed|college students]] flock to the area every [[Spring Break]] to party, drink [[beer]], take [[drug]]s, and have [[List of sex moves|various kinds of sex]]. Some people even love to go for a swim at the beach. And if you don't mind the eye-burning ocean saltwater, the stray jellyfish [[tentacle rape|tentacles]], and the constant [[sharking|shark attacks]], it really is quite a fun and relaxing activity.

==Economy==
Aside from urban crime and [[drug]]-trafficking, Miami's economy also depends heavily on cocaine, crack, marijuana, street racing, and [[fag|Ricky Martin]]. Major imports in Miami are Cubans, Haitians, Jamaicans, cigars, and [[drug]]s. Exports include but are not limited to mangoes, [[cock|bananas]], [[vagina|guavas]], palm trees, and skin cancer.
