Sagefag
[[image:4chan-Sage.jpg|thumb|I'm gonna [[fail]] when the [[bump|next poster]] [[pwn|pwns]] me!]]

Like most [[Bridget|eromenoi]] in [[4chan]] (and any other *chan, for that matter), these [[n00bs|newfags]], after seeing how some [[ghey|faggy]] functions work by putting [[wicca|magic words]] [[In the ass|in the proper field]], [[fail|try their luck]] with saging. Like most of the [[wapanese|stupid-infested population]] there, they [[MySpace|think it makes them cool]] to spam [[sage]] in every thread they see. Too bad we can't see their [[I'm so confused|confused]] faces [[OTI]], wondering why the [[furry]] [[porn]] [[thread]] is still [[bump|making it to the front]], [[PROTIP|which tells you]] how many [[furfags]] dwell there.
They don't seem to realise that [[sage|saging]] isn't an anti-[[bump]].

It is believed that sagefags are a cancer that even a [[House|certain vicodin addicted doctor]] can't cure.

Although, [[fags|some]] [[Some_argue|might argue]] that this is the doing of [[troll|trolls]], just to annoy [[diaperfur|people]].

[[faggot|Sagefaggottry]] should not be confused with [[Pain Series|Sagebomb]], which is done [[for great justice|in a true /b/-tard fashion]].
