{{achtung|Comment and rate on this video to balance out butthurt Muslims}}

In this extremely lulzy video, these Geordie chavs wear tea towels around their heads and douse a Koran with petrol, or something. It bursts into flames and they dance around.

Shockingly, [[America|these men were arrested, even though THEY BROKE NO LAW]]. Northumbria Police arrested them on the grounds of inciting racial hatred, not realising that Islam is NOT a race. No wonder that hero [[Raoul Moat]] hated them. The police fucking confiscated the tea towels when the raided the pub!

On [[September 11]], [[2010]] '''Derek Fenton''' ripped pages from a [[Koran]] and lit them aflame at a protest near the proposed site of a community center and [[Ground Zero Mosque|mosque near Ground Zero]] [[for the lulz]].This was very welcome after the fail that was [[Burn a Koran Day]].


{{quote|This man is burning a piece of paper with ink on it...that is ALL it is...Islam better﻿ get over it because the last time they had a fit about depictions of Mohammed, there were hundreds of thousands of them submitted on "Draw Mohammed Day." This is the ONLY way to teach these morons that just because they believe this rubbish, the rest of the world DOES NOT have to treat it a sacred. Their religion treats other religions with NO RESPECT, that is what they deserve in return.| BOOTPUNK on Jew Tube}}

{{quote|It's not about what he's doing, but the way he's doing it with such conviction. Just look at this badass motherfucker burning qurans and not being afraid of anything. He literally just stands there and takes all the insult like he doesn't give a shit. Then he's taken away thinking "Haters gonna hate" in front of all those daft onlookers. Wish there were more men like him in this day and age. Master Troll.|[[Anonymous]]}}

==Predictable Hissy Fits by Brainwashed Muslims ==
[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/world/asia/15kashmir.html The New York Times reports that an Iranian Satellite Station aired images of the tearing & burning; Kashmiri brainwashed fundies go mental]

The [[Daily Mail | Daily Fail]] reports that [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1311785/Indian-police-kill-18-Kashmir-Koran-burning-riots.html?ito=feeds-newsxml brave Indian soldiers shot 18 foaming Muzzies dead]. Other [[butthurt]] muslims torched a Christian school. Strangely, they also burned effigies of fellow muslim [[Barack Obama]]. 

The Guardian also reports that members of the [[lie|religion of peace]] are targeting hindus & christians, burning churches and schools, in a calm & measured response. Initially, it appeared that [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/13/kashmir-protesters-killed-quran-row only 13 people died]. Later it emerged that [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/14/kashmir-violence-protesters-confront-police 18 foamers were pwned].

Disappointingly, none of the newspapers carried images of [[Koran Man]] doing what he does best; ripping & burning shitty books.
