FUD
[[Image:Pic05.jpg|thumb|One of the many tools of '''FUD''']]

'''FUD''' stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.  It is therefore like [[PLUR]], but without the [[ecstasy]].  FUD is the favorite flaming tool of hi-tech companies directed at your average online user.  One of the more famous tools of FUD is to employ a "research" firm to make dour predictions of your competition, advertise these "findings" on websites, and then claim these studies to be impartial.  While FUD was originally invented by [[IBM]], the master of FUD is actually [[Microsoft]].

If you want to gain instant karma points on [[Slashdot]], accuse the previous poster of spreading FUD.

Fud also means [[cunt]], says [[Urban Dictionary]].
