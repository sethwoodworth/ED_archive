'''Chiberita''' (now known as '''llamapixie''') is your typical [[Christfag]] [[deviantart|TARTlet]]. She loves to troll people's deviations and the forums with the [[lie|word]] of [[Man|God]]. She is also a huge fan of [[Sonic]] and does not believe in [[science]]. She is obsessed with [[Smurfs|Avatar]], Code Geass, [[irony|Fullmetal Alchemist]], and [[Runescape]]. Despite her hatred for science, her lifelong dream is to become a fighter pilot in the [[Military|Air Force]]; a dream which will never be fulfilled because of being [[blind]] in one eye,  having [[sickfuck|asthma]], and being an overall [[retard|dumbfuck]] in general. Her plan B in the military is to become a [[Nazi|sergeant]] in a [[Holocaust|concentration camp]], and preach her [[Lulz]] to the 3rd world. She is also a proud member of the [[magic|Shaman]] Guild on [[Gaia]]

[[Image:MISA MISA by Chiberita.jpg|thumb|200px|Despite her hate for Gays, she is Bisexual and has a full-blown [[Emo]] girlfriend.]]
[[Image:Got Un revised by KingslyGrave.jpg|thumb|200px|Did we also mention that this is her [[Lesbian|other half]]?]]

'Cheyenne', as she likes to be known, wallows in her own ignorance and spreads it all over [[DeviantART]] making sure everyone knows how [[Christian]] she is, and that no one has ever felt God's grace as she had. She will troll you for the rest of her sad and miserable days. She also hates [[Gays]] though she herself is a bisexual, oh and did we tell you her boyfriend is from Vulcan?

Chiberita, being the [[shitty|incredible artist]] she is, posts mostly photographs of whatever is on TV, Desktop Screen-shots, and whatever crudely drawn [[Animu]] she could come up with. She likes to spam her watchers with shitloads of photographs of her old ass TV. Being a uber [[Christfag]], Chiberita has received her fair share of counter-trolling, to which she hides the comments. She also must include something about [[Jesus]] in every single one of her comments and journals, no matter how irrelevant it may be to the subject. Most of her 'best' drawings if she has any are usually drawn by someone else, who is ironically a [[Lesbian]] [[Furry]].

==Chiberita Fanart==

Apparently Chiberita is so [[Popular]] that she has a number of fans on Gaia and DA, many of which drew fanart of her. The art itself is of course much better than anything of her own work, but gives this [[Troll]] more than she ever deserved. If you find any [[MOAR]] fanart or have a work of your own doing feel free to spread the [[Lulz]].

[[Image:DA ID by llamapixie.jpg|thumb|200px|She's so proud of that [[loser|brace-faced]] [[Cracker]].]]
{{quote|sGod has to do with everything|Chiberita, justifying her irrelevant commentary.}}

Chiberita feels that she needs to include her religious beliefs in everything regardless of how irrelevant her statements may be. Her typical pasttime includes trolling the most popular Deviations on the site in order to promote her beliefs. She refuses to accept science and goes out of her way to hate on [[gays]]. Top science officials now think she may have a disorder that compels her to [[spam]] endlessly. She is a cadet in the [[LARP|United States Child Brigade]] and her dreams of becoming a fighter jet pilot were crushed when they rejected her application on account of her [[Blindness]], [[Aids|Asthma]], and apparent [[Insanity]]. Plan-B being that she become the [[Nazi|overseer]] of a [[Holocaust|Concentration Camp]], this however has backfired ever since she realized that Hitler died like forever ago. She also has an addiction to [[WoW]] and [[Runescape]], she is also your typical run of the mill [[weeaboo]]. She loves [[4kids]] and is a self-proclaimed mercenary Crusader on Gaia.

[[Image:Ban Evasion.PNG|thumb|200px|Self admittance.]]
On July 12th, 2010 Chiberita eventually received a total [[Banhammer]] by the DA admins after receiving many warnings. She was reported for [[Spam]] as well as posting other people's works and pictures of her television. Within a couple hours of her ban she created a new account immediately. After repeated warnings over her ban evasion she decided to block anyone who tried to either help or troll her, hid her comments, and deleted the journal entry regarding her new account, the proof however is far from erased. On July 14, 2010 she deactivated her Llamapixie account, possibly in order to evade further action by the administrators and counter trolling. As most [[Trolls]] she will probably resurface again shortly. 
[[Image:Chiberita Support.PNG|center|Support for Chiberita, quite possibly Chiberita herself.]]
On July 15, 2010 a user named Llauoyetahi surfaced on ED, the user repeatedly deleted the contents of this page and complained stating "Can this page be unprotected or deleted entirely? I know this person and this isn't cool.", this user also blanked the article and replaced it with the words "I swear to god...!". What few contributions this user has made consists mostly of vandalism to this page, and it is quite possible that this user may be Chiberita herself.
