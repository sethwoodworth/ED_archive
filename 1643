Cm
'''/cm/''', known also as "Cute Male", is sometimes said to be the kindest of all the boards on [[4chan]]. It was created [[last_thursday|last Thursday]] with the purpose of navigating [[pictures]] of [[animated]] [[male]] characters away from [[/c/]] so the [[16_year_old_girls|16 year old girls]] and [[gay|gays]] have something to look at. On /cm/ you will often see well-known male characters from your favorite [[anime]], [[cartoon]] or [[video_game|vidya game]] completely [[pussy|emasculated]], [[fag|fagified]], and all-around [[fucked|raped to shit]].

/cm/ is not to be confused with [[yaoi|/y/]], it's non-worksafe counterpart. [[Image:CM.jpg|thumb|right|Typical straight guy on /cm/]]

==Common Threads found on /cm/==

*'''-Insert current popular fandom here- threads''': Once a new [[Kingdom Hearts]] game, or season of [[Fullmetal Alchemist]] comes out there is will constantly be one or moar threads featuring the popular male characters and "pairings" floating about. Once the popularity of said anime or game dies down, however, people will be so sick of seeing it that they will most likely [[sage]] any new threads on the topic.

*'''Ears/Tails AKA Caturday threads''': [[Kemonomimi]]-themed males, often depicting the shittiest of all fanart (for some reason), and barely ever get any posts half the time but still, people make them. A lot.

*'''Slash Threads/Cannot Unsee threads''': Threads ONLY depicting [[fanart]] of two males being [[homosexual|faggots]]. Anything from holding hands to [[frot|frotting]] can exist in threads such as these. Lurk with caution.

*'''Cannot Unsee 2.0 threads''': Threads [[slash|slashing]] males from [[Transformers]], [[Megaman]], [[hetalia|countries]] etc. 

*'''Borderline /y/ threads''': Threads were /cm/ tries to post the naughtiest images without getting [[banned]], completely missing the point that is a "worksafe" board. As long as they don't show [[penis|peenor]] it's A-OK!

*'''Foldershare threads''': After a long hard day of collecting fan art of your favorite character, why not put it in a .zip folder and share with all your fellow h/cm/os? These threads are designed to make it easier to access a bulk amount of fapping material at once.

==Attempting to Troll /cm/==
Due to the lax nature of h/cm/os, trolling this board is often an unrewarding experience. More often than not, troll boards will be ignored entirely. However, many /cm/ users do not know how to [[sage]] properly, so try out the following:

'''How to troll /cm/:'''

*Post yourself (or another [[ugly]] guy) and ask if you're [[cute]].
*Post a picture of a girl, real or animated.
*Post [[porn|Pron]] or [[furry|furries]].
*Post [[Yaoi]]
*Tell them that [[slashfic|slash]] is [[retarded]] and unrealistic.
*etc.
