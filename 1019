'''[[China|Blaming China]]''' is a [[W|US]] government [[drama-generating technique]] currently being [[forced meme|forced on]] the [[Americunt|American]] [[sheep|public]] to cover their arses from blame when the [[ruin|economy collapses]] since [[all your base are belong to us|all our money are belong to them]].

Since taking over from [[Bill Clinton]] in [[2000]], the [[George W. Bush]] [[I accidentally|administration has squandered a national surplus of five point six trillion into a nation debt of three trillion]] which those inscrutable [[Chinks]] snapped up on [[eBay]] and proceeded to rape America in the arse by charging exorbitant (and constantly growing) interest rates that have ensured your grandchildrens' [[Global Warming|mutant cancerous]] grandchildren will still be paying off whilst the principal loan will remain forever [[pwnt|out of reach]].

To make matters worse, at least 110% of everything sold in America is now "Made in China" since [[Mexicans]] are fat, lazy and want too much, constantly bitching about their treatment as America's new [[slaves]].

==[[DGT|The DGT]]==

Realising how bad this all looks, the administration [[:Image:Barney_first_dog.jpg|brains trust]] decided that [[Counterstrike|damage control]] of some sort was needed to discredit our soon-to-be Commie lord and  
masters so that when China finally [[pwn|calls in]] the marker for all the loans (and accrued interest) and pwns the USA, the <strike>American people</strike> New Chinese won't roll over passively and abandon all the things that made this nation great like [[Starbucks]], [[Colonel Sanders]]' [[chikins]] and [[abortion]] in favour of [[urine|Green Tea]], General Cho's [[dog|chikins]] and China's [[adoption|planned parenthood]] policies.

*Increased pollution on the Western Sea Board because of the rise in the population in cashmere goats (producing cashmere for the US market). Supposedly they have [[Satan|pointy hooves]] which stir up the dust in the Gobi Desert (which then becomes the latest Chinese import via the [[science|Jet Stream]]) whilst foraging for food.

*Doing nothing to curb their rampant and flagrant industry pollution that's melting the ice caps (the irony being that said production is mainly making tube socks to keep our feet toasty).
*Exploding Department of Water and Power transformers that have recently plunged millions of hot and bothered [[Los Angeles|Angelinos]] into hours of darkness and sweat during a record breaking heatwave. (sauce)

*[[Yahoo]]'s [http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2007/11/05/daily18.html falling stock prices].
*Losing the [[LOLympics]] because China had [[loli]] gymnasts who took all the <s>Jew</s> Chink <s>gold</s> lead.
*Oppressing Tibetans(even though Americans, Australians, and Canadians live almost entirely on stolen land taken from Native Americans and the vaguely black Aboriginals)
*Paving the way currently for how ALL our internets will be censored and monitored within the next ten years, paranoid slanty eyed freakoids that they are. Google played along with this until very recently, and we all (should) know those cunts have kept track of our searches for two years.

Fallout from this epic [[IRL troll]] has been [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17973229/ swift] and [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/08/business/petfood.php dramatic] as a [[azn|proud people]] such as the Chinese are prone to much [[butthurt|hand-wringing]] and [[YHBT|national shame]] when accused of [[nice try|coming up short]]. Heads have (and will continue to) [[engrish|loll]].

However, it's mainly business as usual in China since they've been sending America unregulated, poorly made, cheap crap constructed by people who don't give a flying fuck (under conditions that would be considered inhumane and in the US) since [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] [[BFF]]d them in the mid-'70s.
