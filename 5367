Michelle Malkin
[[Image:Malkinmoving8nk.jpg|thumb|[[Michelle Malkin]] and her minions of evil.]]	
'''Michelle Malkin''' is a professional [[Asian]] [[cunt]] who spends her time "exposing" the [[liberal media]] and sucking off fat, white conservatives in exchange for an undeserved syndication like the good [[Thailand|Thai]] [[whore]] she is.  Like [[Ann Coulter]], she is an [[IRL]] [[troll]] as well.  The only differences between her and Coulter are her slanted eyes and lack of an [[Trap|Adam's Apple]]. She is known for her ability to [http://www.google.com/search?&q=ping+pong+ball+queefing+bitch+malkin queef ping-pong balls].  Her fellow [[Republicans]] don't have the heart to tell her she's not white.
==History==	
[[Image:MeSoHorny.jpg|thumb|left|A young Malkin [[prostitute|auditions for]] a pair of [[Faux News]] foreign correspondents]]
[[Image:bastards.jpg|thumb|Yes, yes she does.]]
Michelle started by writing a series of books no one [[tl;dr|read]].  One of her books, ''In Defense of Internment'', was all about why the [[Japan|Japs]] should be [http://michellemalkin.com/archives/000337.htm re-interned.]  In another [[tl;dr]] website, two historians pretty much [http://www.isthatlegal.org/Muller_and_Robinson_on_Malkin.html pwned] her book by pointing out that she updates her webpage [[at least 100|everyday]], but still had enough time to write her book in about six months.  Clearly she couldn't have done that, especially since she's a [[woman]] and [[Azn|Asian]].  

Malkin is fond of putting quotes from various unnamed liberals calling her a gook, etc. on her books in place of normal reviews.  This is probably because there are no good reviews, assuming anyone could be bothered to review her at all.  The stilted nature of these "liberal attacks" might lead one to suspect she's trying to look important enough that someone important enough to be quotable would bother acknowledging her in public.  As if Malkin would miss a chance to namedrop anyone who bothered to acknowledge her, regardless of how unimportant they are ("She smells like [[Cum|feet]]." - Middle School Teacher, Nebraska).

==Michelle Gets [[Pwned]]==
[[At least 100|A few months ago]], Michelle got very [[emo|pissed]] because those damn atheist liberals were protesting [[shit nobody cares about|some war or something]] in some [[Iraq|country no one has ever heard of]].  So, in a sad, sad attempt to generate [[lulz]] on her blog, Michelle [http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004974.htm put up phone numbers of those damn atheist liberals] who were involved.  Rather than sue for [[libel]] and [[harassment]], the [[liberal]]s posted Michelle's shit all over the [[internets]], causing her and  [[bitch|her]] Jew to move.  This also resulted in her children being pulled out of school.  When it was found out that she wasn't homeschooling her children like a [[white trash|white, God-fearing Republican Christian]] would, she was shunned by conservatives everywhere. Her fanboys, however, latched onto her '''harder''',  like remoras on a shark.

==Webcamming==
Every week Michelle hosts her own online show, ''Hot Air''.  Basically, it's what you'd find on your garden variety Yahoo chat room.  But this time, she has an OMG green screen, and will, on occasion, use [[unfunny]] props or awesome MIDIs for her background music, or even give a [http://michellemalkin.com/archives/005232.htm ping-pong ball show].

==Having Your Humility==
Take a good hard look at the picture to the right. [[Hawt]], [[amirite]]? Unfortunately the "[[Photoshop]]pers" at [http://www.wonkette.com/politics/michelle-malkin/michelle-you-ignorant-slut--204095.php Wonkette] didn't give her [[Boobs|titties]] a big enough boost, causing Michelle to go [[batshit insane]] [http://michellemalkin.com/archives/006012.htm and become butthurt]. 

Wonkette enjoyed the resulting [http://www.wonkette.com/politics/michelle-malkin/michelle-you-ignorant-slut--204095.php#c471435 lulz], but Michelle didn't, because her site is [[Bible|99% lulz-free]]. When Wonkette kept up the lulz, she went Defcon One [[W|nukular]] on Wonkette and its shitty sister site, Gawker, resulting in even better lulz. [http://michellemalkin.com/archives/006016.htm][http://michellemalkin.com/archives/006025.htm] She then began a nefarious plot against the [[truth|"lying hate-mongers"]] by harassing "the [[internet_hate_machine|Gawker Smear Machine]]". When they refused to amplify her 'skeeter bites to Biblical proportions, she immediately filed suit for [[libel]] against her "[[Whore|pristine character]]". Despite being obviously the [[Parody|truth]], this has not stopped her rabid [[fanboy]]s from declaring [[Jihad|E-jihad]] against those who say the suit is without merit [http://ace.mu.nu/archives/198769.php].

==[[Pedophile]] Apologist==
Michelle Malkin is also an apologist for [[pedophile]]s!  [http://hotair.com/archives/2006/10/02/were-foleys-e-mails-altered/ According to her site, hotair.com], these emails were altered by the "New York Slimes" (OMG REPUBLICAN PUN).

==BREAKING NEWS==
Michelle's [[batshit insane|batshit insanity]] has gone to new heights and caused [[moar]] IRL drama. On her blog, she said that [[fat|Dunkin' Donuts]] was supporting the "terrists" because in one of their ads, that [[whore]] from the Food Network was wearing a scarf that slightly resembled one worn by [[Osama Bin Laden]]. Dunkin' Donuts decided to pull the ad due to Michelle's [[fatwa]] against scarves and the potential backlash of Michelle's [[retard|fanbase]]. 

==Pubic Wig?==
Malkin's last name is, according to [[TOW]], an asian mispronunciation of the term "merkin," or pubic wig.  Merkins are particularly handy for covering up sores from nasty-ass STDs, or for disguising the fact that a woman shaved her [[pussy]] to get rid of lice.  It is for the reader to decide whether or not this bit of etymology has any bearing on Michelle Malkin's personality.

==You <strike>can</strike> <strike>can't</strike> almost can Troll her[[Oneoneone|!111!!]]==
Malkin has now <strike>opened</strike> closed registration for comments [http://hotair.com/archives/2006/10/19/comment-registration-is-now-open-2/ on her site, Hot Air], but she is about to reopen them on her Main blog.  If you're looking to troll, [[plz]] <strike>sign up!</strike> hold.  Do not hesitate if you are not a liberal.  Many normal people hate Malkin for just being herself.  Plz stand by for further announcements [[for great justice]]. In the mean time, you can [[spam|email]] her at michelle@hotair.com. 

==Trivia==
Although she is a small woman, Michelle has a [[goatse|massive bunghole]].  She is the current holder of the International Extreme Anal Dildo award.

Malkin heroically defended her ancestral home planet against the evil-doers Tarak and Cheral in the Battle For Endor [[at least 100 years ago]].

"Micherr Marrkin" is also an anchor baby. Her parents "visited" the US from the [[Philippines]] when her mother, an [[Star Wars|Ewok]] elder of no importance, was nine months [[pregnant]]. The plan was to give birth to Micherr in America so that she would automatically be a US citizen, and due to the same weak immigration enforcement Marrkin herself now frequently [[crybaby|cries]] about, inadequate immigration laws and lax enforcement by the [[government]] led the Department of Immigration and Naturalization to [[fail]] it. It is keeping [[fugly]] [[Star Wars|Ewok]]-looking anchor babies out of the voting citizenry of USA. A movement is now under way to [[permaban]] Marrkin's US citizenship, as only real [[baby|babies]] are eligible for this citizenship loophole, and not physiologically advanced [[Party Man|vaginal discharge]], as Micherr was from birth.

==Going to [[Lollercaust|Iraq?!]]==
Yes, this [[cunt|upstanding young woman]] has been [http://michellemalkin.com/archives/006549.htm invited to Iraq] as a correspondent to report an [[Lies|accurate, unbiased perspective of the Iraq war]]. Even though upwards of a million Iraqi civilians and over 4,000 American soldiers have died as a result of the war and occupation, the MSM is sending a '''bad image''' because the AP reported a story about six Muslims getting set on fire and killed.

Acknowledging the risks of being in a war zone, Malkin [[butthurt|lamented]] that her critics would only want to "see me [[epic win|shot in the face]] or dead". Fortunately for her, her risk was substantially reduced by her refusal to actually fight in a war she ardently supported throughout [[W|Dubya's]] presidency, despite being both young and fit enough to qualify for enlistment. Like most other conservative commentators, she [[coward|prudently]] decided to sit the conflict out.
