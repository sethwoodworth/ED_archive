The '''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders''', published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]], is the handbook used most often in diagnosing [[mental illness|mental disorder]]s in the [[United States]] and other countries. It is also heavy enough to bludgeon a patient with if he goes mental, or is just really annoying.

==Uses==
Often referenced to illustrate some knowledge of psychological disorders in [[flame wars]] or consulted to create personality [[meme]]s. If someone claims to be a psychology major, it is nearly guaranteed that they have encountered this book and will reference it in threads as the ultimate source of and authority on all things mental.

==Mental Illness to Order==
It can even be used as a checklist for people into [[disease]] [[attention_whore|whoring]].  There are substantiated reports of people in their late [[teenagers|teens]] getting together and going through and diagnosing themselves and others in an ad-hoc manner in order to obtain prescription  drugs, like [[marijuana]].  Despite the nearly legalese style in which all people specializing in psychological disorders must speak to convey the fuckitude of the stuff they deal with, which the DSM is written in, somehow the social rejects of the world find ways to excuse their failures in all things social with a few awkwardly worded passages quoted from the DSM.

==Controversy==
While widely accepted among psychologists and psychiatrists, the manual has proved controversial in its listing of certain characteristics as mental disorders.  The most notorious example is the listing in the DSM-II of [[fags|homosexuality]] as a mental disorder; a classification that was removed by vote of the APA in 1973 (see also [[fags|homosexuality]] and [[psychology]]). It has yet to include [[Otherkin]].
