NES
[[Image:Mac_mini_nes.jpg|thumb|Nintendo's failed attempt at releasing a CD-based system before Sega.]]
'''''The NES''''' is a system made by Nintendo [[at least 100 years ago|about 100 years ago]]. It is widely regarded as the best system ever by all except [[basement-dweller|Atari fatties]] because it made people realize that Atari is shit. It is advisable to use emulators because if you were to play an NES for real, you are required to [[Oral sex|blow into the game]] for hours until it actually works. Although the NES is the coolest system evar, [[hot topic]] [[fags]] like to pretend to like it by wearing cool shirts with NES characters and icons on them. Depending on how many games you played in a day, you could expect to spend half of your entire fucking day blowing on a speck of dust to get the cartridge to play.

Because everyone and their mother had a "Nintendo," video games are called "Nintendo games" by old people even today.


==Landmark Titles==
===Bokosuka Wars (1985)===

[[Image:Budd_Dwyer_NES.jpg|thumb|right|150px|It would go on to outsell even the NES itself.]]

===[[Budd Dwyer]] (1987) ===
''Budd Dwyer'' capitalized on the [[suicide]] fad of the late 1980s by allowing [[Americunts|Middle Americans]] to experience the thrill of ventilating their skull without any of the [[Pain_Series|messy]] and permanent [[death|drawbacks]]. 

[[Image:Hitler Explodes.gif|thumb|left|The greatest moment in video game history.]]

=== [[World War II|Bionic Commando]] (1988) ===
''Bionic Commando'' is a classic video game fondly remembered as the best game ever despite not having a jump button. This game features a historically accurate plot about Hitler (renamed Master D by [[Jews|censors]]) being resurrected to dominate the world. Despite removing all references to Nazis, it was still revolutionary for introducing the word "damn" to the NES' vocabulary and featuring Hitler's exploding head.

=== [[Megaman|Mega Man 2]] (1989) ===
More like ''[[fag|Faga Man 2]]''.

=== [[Bad Dudes]] (1989) ===
[[Image:Badenoughdude.gif|thumb|right|''Bad Dudes'' is known for its critically acclaimed plot.]]
''Bad Dudes'' is an action game created by Data East. While the game possesses shitty gameplay, this game is still a solid candidate for the best NES game ever due to its plot: rescue [[Ronald Reagan]] from ninjas, dogs, and Karnov, who Data East [[Mary Sue|Mary Sues]] into every single one of their games.

=== Battletoads (1991) ===
{{main|Is this Battletoads}}
''Battletoads'' is a video game franchise by Rare Ltd. created to rival the ''Teenage Mutant Colin barker Turtles'' games. And ''Battletoads'' is a better game, but hard as shit.

=== Action 52 (1991) ===
[[Image:Action52.gif|thumb|left|The genesis of all badly drawn furry foot fetish art.]]
''Action 52'' is a [[Doug|very expensive]] video game ($200) created by Active Enterprises, who is nothing more than two [[basement-dweller|basement dwellers]]. Nobody knew it was possible to cram 52 shitty games into one NES cart, which include an even worse rip-off of ''Jaws'' and a queer version of ''Bionic Commando'' in which touching money actually damages you. The most notable of the 52 games, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|The Cheetahmen]]'', proves that furfags are responsible for the death of the NES.

Active Enterprise held a [http://cheetahmen.silius.net/contest.html contest] to see who could beat one of their shitty games for a grand prize of $104,000. Their greatest lulz is that the game was too badly programmed to beat without cheating because the game locks up after two or three stages.{{clear}}
