Face-painter

[[Image:Bukkake photo.gif|thumb|left|[[ZOMG]] [[fail|FACE-PAINTING IS AWESOME!]]]] A '''face-painter''' is an interesting sort of [[sick fuck]] that populates the [[MySpace]] of the [[internets]]. Face-painters are [[men]] who print womens' [[MySpace]] pics (nevar [[pr0n]]) and [[fap]] on them. Then they take pictures of the [[cum]] [[art]] and upload it onto MySpace. Apparently they get some sort of arousal out of this. In reality, they just have a [[fetish]] that resulted from [[basement dweller|not getting out enough]]. Normally (but not always) [[heterosexual]], face-painters range in age from [[Pedobear]] targets to Pedobear's parents. Most are [[fat]] and/or have small [[cock]]s. They never [[circle jerk|network]] and collaborate to produce even [[moar]] art.


==History==

Face-painting was discovered [[at least 100 years ago]] in ancient [[Japan]]. The practice spread throughout [[Asia]], though it is now uncommon among [[AZN]]s except [[IRL]]. In recent years, face-painting has become the favorite hobby of internet [[sick fuck]]s and [[13-year-old boy]]s alike. Today, a more innocent reason for face painting is ... simply having fun.

It is a common entertainment at county fairs, large open-air markets (especially in Europe and the Americas), and other locations [[Chris Hanson|where children and adolescents are]].

Face painting is very popular among children at theme parks, parties and festivals throughout the Western world. Though the majority of face painting is [[Pedobear |geared towards children]], many teenagers and adults enjoy being painted for special events.

Face painting (aka cum tributes) can be combined with other [[fetishes]] such as using a bra, pantyhose, shoes or panties when rubbing one out.

==How to Spot a Face-painter==
Commonly mistaken as [[bukkake]] which is usually practiced by black personz with [[white]][[women]], face-painting is every [[16-year-old girl]]'s biggest turn-on. The face-painter usually paints solo with his chosen photo. Face-painters may meet together to share their past artwork, and to create new paintings, but rarely do two "paint" on the same photo. Chris Crocker (right) is a fan of doing this to himself since nobody would go near that [[tranny]] sack of [[shit]].

On MySpace, Facebook, Flickr you can [[lurk moar]] until you find someone with a name liek "pic blaster" or "photo-cummer". They only add [[women]], which is [[unfunny|funny]] because everybody knows there are no real women on the internet. Just kidding. There are countless girls photos that just beg to be painted.  Anyone who says they [[cum]] on pics is also a face-painter. Most of them add a lot of [[camwhore]]s, [[slut]]s, [[16-year-old girl]]s, [[trap]]s, MILFs, and the occasional [[loli]] or piece of [[jailbait]]. While face-painters consider their art to be [[porn|friendly fun]], the MySpace policia think it's their business to seek out face-painters and humiliate them.. Though facing the equivalent of [[fursecution]], face-painters have [[balls]] (unlike [[furry|furries]]), and thus survive the constant [[internet humanitarian]] attacks directed at them.

==Celebrity Face-Painting==
Anyone is fair game for being face-painted. In fact most female celebs, whether they may be actresses, newsbabes, newsmakers or sports stars, know they have fap fans. Face-painting a photo is just the final tribute. There was a site called Got Cum? that featured celeb cum tributes daily. Unfortunately if closed down last year.
