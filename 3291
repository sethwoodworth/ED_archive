A phrase said by shitty nigra hip-hop [[Retard|artist]] [[Kanye West]] on a [[Red Cross]] telethon when he went completely off script and started freestyling (because he's [[bullshit|so talented]]) about how the [[New Orleans]] situation is being handled with regard to [[Hurricane Katrina]]. 

The telethon sponsored by the Red Cross included several celebrities talking about hurricane Katrina and reading pre-written scripts off of a teleprompter. [[Kanye West]] and Mike Myers of ''Wayne's World II'' and ''Cat In the hat'' fame were to do a dual narration and read the script while images of the hurricane's effects played in montage behind them. 

Mike Myers dutifully read his part verbatim. When Myers looked over to cue Kanye West to speak his part, Kanye went completely off script, spouting gems which will be legendary on the [[internets]] for decades. Kanye stopped his tirade and Mike Myers stepped right in to finish his second part of the speech, again reading it perfectly verbatim. When he was finished he looked back at Kanye and Kanye said nothing but "[[George Bush]] doesn't care about [[black people]]." Mike Myers then made a face which is fucking priceless and the producers immediately cut to Chris Tucker who looks completely dazed and begins spouting any crap he can come up with such as "Help! Please help. HELP HELP HELP!" and other nonsense which is on topic but was just as [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|inarticulate]].

== Reactions ==
The reactions in the mainstream media were as expected and telethon sponsor NBC stated some bullshit about how Kanye's criticism doesn't speak for them. But the [[internets]] populace made icons, [[image macro]]s and posted the links all over the [[internets]].

===Five Years Late: [[W]]'s Retort===
After considering Kanye's allegations for five years, Dubya's mighty brain responded to them with the aid of his ghostwriter. In his (undoubtedly hilarious) memoir, Bush claims that he was as "disgusted" and "deeply insulted"[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/in-memoir-bush-strikes-back-at-kanye-west/?partner=rss&emc=rss] by this dumb jigaboo's comments as the entire nation was by his administration.

{{quote|It’s one thing to say, 'I don’t appreciate the way he’s handled his business.' It’s another thing to say, 'This man’s a racist.' I resent it. It’s not true. And it was one of the most disgusting moments in my presidency.|[[Moron|W]], speaking to [[Idiot|Matt Lauer]]}}

Never mind the mind-boggling irony of this statement in consideration of the war in [[Iraq]], the [[Pulling a Lynndie|atrocities of the Abu Ghraib scandal]] and the innumerable litany of missteps his administration took on behalf of Big Oil, [[Fundamentalists]], Israeli and Saudi interests and especially his own stupidity. A former president of the [[USA]] actually addressed accusations voiced by a brain-damaged pop star.
