Too drunk to type? Why not make a '''phone post'''?

Phone posts annoyingly allow users to add a sound recorded message to their [[blog]] entries. In most cases, these posts are worse than their regular [[attention whore]] posts, but provide the perfect opportunity for others to transcribe them [[I did it for the lulz|for the lulz]]. The user calls a special phone number and enters their [[IPN|PIN]], allowing them to leave a recorded message which is then posted to their [[journal]]. This feature is popular on [[LiveJournal]] but some other [[blog]]ging services have it as well.

In the case of LiveJournal, the sound clip is exported to ogg vorbis format, [[mp3]] or GSM-encoded WAV.

Today, phone posts are considered [[old media]] with the advent of [[vlog]]ging on [[YouTube]] and [[LiveVideo]].
