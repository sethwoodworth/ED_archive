Googlesux
{{work| intertent drama, pictures, ect.}}
'''[http://www.googlesux.com Googlesux]''' is probably the worst parody site to ever exist. Like many other pointless ''x'' sucks websites, Googlesux comes complete with [[shitty art|ugly-ass graphics]], [[ALL CAPS|ALL CAPITAL TEXT]], and [[shit no one cares about|stupid reasons why the mentioned thing sucks]].

==SOME OF THE REASONS GOOGLE SUX==

*1) UBER-ARROGANT
*6) THERE'S MANY OTHER REASONS BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE CUTE RAINBOW LOGO
*7) ENTER YOUR REASON:
*9000)  Sucks corn from my rectal cavity after a fuckin'
As can be seen above, Googlesux has some [[lie|extremely good reasons]] as to why Google does suck, but it seems the [[anonymous|Internet]] does not agree. The majority of comments on the site are [[you fail it|bashing Googlesux and not Google itself]]. 

==Typical Googlesux comments==

'''Pro-Google:'''

*''[[ALL CAPS|GOOGLE IS AWESOME YOU LIARS]]''

*''Google [[pwn|pwns]]. Go suck your [[Spellcheck|cok.]]''

*[[tldr|''Google doesn't "suck". I get tired of the pornography that you get very often, and how sometimes you can't find the simplest things. But doesn't every website have things they need to work on?'']]


Okay, perhaps not the best examples of pro-Google comments; but hey, they're still more intelligent than the anti-Google comments.


'''Anti-Google:'''

*''I want to crush Google with my finger!!!!!!!!!!''


Fight the power, buddy.


*''google is a steaming pile of [--EDITED BY GOOGLE--]!!! I REALLY HATE THEM ALL SO [--EDITED BY GOOGLE--]''


[[Fail|Failed]] attempt at being funny.


*''Their adverts are so annoying! TThey are all over my webpage 'adds by google' and 'google adds' "arggg" google SUCKS!''


Maybe their adverts are on ''your'' webpage because ''you'' put them there, dumbass.


==Hypocrisy==

Although Googlesux claims to be anti-censorship (look at reason #3) they [[censorship|review comments before they are posted on the site]]. Nice work, assholes.

And it doesn't even seem like the dumbasses noticed that Google is listed under the ''Bookmark & Share'' menu which can be accessed from the top of the page. Pure anti-Google genius.
