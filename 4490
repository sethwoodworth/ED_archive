'''Karaokeplay.com''' is a website offering [[Youtube|free karaoke]]. Visitors can record their own version of popular songs and rate other recordings. All you need is a microphone, [[lie|some music talent]], a [[USI|burning desire to be famous]] and zero ability to self-edit.  If you can't get enough bad midi, over-modulated microphones and squealing vocals, this is the place to be.

==Karaoke Tips==
#Pick a song entirely out of your vocal range (or a duet - sing both parts for ultimate win).
#Make sure you don't know any of the lyrics - they're written down for you!
#Can't emote with your voice?  Just close your eyes and sway while you sing - no one will notice.
#Make sure your [http://www.karaokeplay.com/recordings/i-wanna-know-what-love-3579917.html nose is very stuffy].  
#Have the mic volume completely out of proportion to the music.
#[[William Shatner|Completely ignore the timing]].
