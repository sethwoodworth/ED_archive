Subject: Here's that copied eulogy.<br/>

(copied from the original MSWord file...you may want to print this out)
 

Patti Chandler<br/>
March 17, 1988 to June 27, 2006
 
Eulogy written by Christian Weston Chandler, June 27, 2006
 
My family, furry friends, (anyone else present), we are gathered here today to pay our last respects and wishes to our dearly beloved beagle/spitz, Patti, who has departed from our world here on earth to a doggy heaven where she will be happier, because she will run free and play with all the other dogs who are already having fun up there.  And she will often look down upon her beloved family, me, Christian Chandler, my mother, Barbara Chandler, and my father Robert Chandler, and the cats who have grown fond of Patti.<br/><br/>
I will always remember Patti for all the lovely memories she has shared with me from:<br/>
-When I picked her out of the litter at my Aunt Corina's house in Redoak, Virginia.<br/>
-The many walks I have shared with her around this neighborhood, as well as the neighborhood in the Newberry Towne subdivision in Richmond, Virginia.<br/>
-The time I watched my old best friend, Sarah Hammer, take Patti by her front paws and danced a bit.<br/>
-The times I've watched her stand on her hind legs and then rewarded her with a biscuit bone.<br/>
-The time I took my camera to her pen and took this lovely picture of her and me, and I made a big deal how she'll be like a movie dog star.<br/>
-The times I've just sat with her in the yard and petted her head.  I've always given her a "Bally-Scratch" where I stroke her head with all five fingers like as if I was gently squeezing a rubber ball.<br/>
-The many times I've fed her a can of food and a cup full of dry food, and refilled her bucket with fresh water so she can drink it and wash her face.<br/>
-There was also the one time I saw her resting on top of her doghouse (not on her back like Snoopy).<br/>
-I've often wondered why between both her ears, why one was bent and the other was straight like an arrowhead.<br/><br/>
 
When Patti was brought to the vet on that faithful day, I was distraught with fright and concern for her health.  I stayed with her during her final moments with a hand on her head and a tear in my eye.  When my mother was brought the paper that gave the doctor permission to send her on her way, I didn't want her to be the one to sign it.  I raised Patti since she was a six-week old pup, and I wanted to take the strain for signing the one-way ticket (it was hard for me, but it was for the best).  So I signed that paper, with a crying Sonichu face saying, "We love you, Patti."  After that, I gave her my final  pets, hug, hand-to-paw hold, eye-contact, ear-rub, cheek-to-fur rub, and I sadly waved her for the final time, and I said, "Good Bye, Patti, I Love You."  As I stood outside, I heard Patti's last barks saying, "I will always love you, Chris.  Thank You."<br/>
 
But we all must move on with our lives with our beloved lucky mutt in our hearts and in our memories.  So, Patti, may your old dog house and surrounding flowers forever memorialize your blessed heart, your barks at the stars and strangers, and your loyal love that you have blessed upon me and my family and friends.  Bark on, and rest in peace, our beloved lucky Patti.

Susan Hannifan and I will be able to meet with you on Monday February 9th in my office at 3:00 p.m.  I do not have any time this week that works with all of our schedules, so it will have to be next Monday.  I normally send students notice of appointments by mail, but you have asked that I correspond to you through email.  It is necessary that this meeting take place, so if Monday is not convenient for you please let me know  and we will set a time for Wednesday.

Mary, I've slept on it, and I have realized that note-hanging is not the way to get attention.  And I don't really want to meet with either you nor Susan, no offense.  I'll tell you what, let's forget the meeting, and if you will allow my newsletter to stay in distribution, I will do all of the following:

-I will never hang notes on the wall again.<br/>
-I'll consider stopping my Silent Treatment on Susan.<br/>
-I'll consider knocking you and Susan up my scale of Respect each by 2 points (0=No Respect...10=Respect).<br/>

Please reply via E-Mail.

Christian C.

Subject: Re: Hello<br/>

Hey, Mrs. Sanford (or should I say Ginny or Virginia ), I am delighted to hear from you as well.  And It is also good to know that you are still residing at that address.  The DVD is under production, to be completed a few days after February 24, 2007 (my 25th Birthday...Yay).
 
You may be able to help me in a portion of it now; there will be a Slideshow (projected from my PlayStation Portable) featuring not only pics of me growing up, but the friends, teachers and relatives I've known and remembered (either from heart, like yourself, as well as yearbook signatures).  Anyway, do you remember from the ol' class, Sarah and Micha (the blonde girl with glasses, and the slow-talking african american who Ms. Eckel told over and over to get his dad to teach him how to shave)?  I remembered both of them from heart, but unfortunately I don't remember their last names, so it's harder to find them in the yearbooks; could you tell me their last names, please?
 
As for what had happened during PVCC, in a nutshell; about Mid-Summer, 2003, I've realize upon revolation that I needed a girl friend to make into a Sweetheart from the Ground-Up, so with a sign (which I've later realized that it made me look slow-minded; the "R" Word), I've started my Enduring Love Quest.  The Dean of Student Serveces, Mary Lee Walsh came out and tore my sign up right in front of me, and said, "You're not gonna get a Girlfriend this way or any way."  That *&^%$ SHATTERED MY HEART AND MURDERED MY SOUL.  And it wasn't just her, the Policemen Imposters in Brown, White and Red, AKA The Jerkops (Blue and Black ARE the TRUE POLICE SOLDIERS) also seriously indented the impression that "Virgina is for Virgins, NOT Lovers".
 
But it has a happy ending; in Mid-2005, when I've started playing the Yu-Gi-Oh TCG, I met this girl who upon numerous conversations, art-sharing and secret confidence, I've grown fond of, and my Heart and Soul Recovered from the Serious Emotional and Physical Pain I've endured.  Although she's not intrested in a serious relationship, I still am fond of her, and I'm hoping that she may have a change of heart.
 
You may learn more about what had happened to me from the Sub-Episodes in my "Sonichu" Comic Book, which I have the legable images uploaded onto my CWC's Sonichu Site!; those Sub-Episodes are based on my Real-Life Events.  *sigh
 
Well, that's about it for now; I hope you do well as well.  And I will make that DVD copy for you after I've finalized the master copy.  Please tell the remaing faculty who are still working at Providence that I wish them the best as well.  I still remember Mrs. Rogers (my ol' computer teacher) when she played as Woodstock in the 1996 "Snoopy" play; that was just fun and cute.  :)
 
Take care;<br/>
Christian Weston Chandler, A.K.A. (nickname) Chris Chan.

Subject: Re: Alright

Hey, Megan.  To start... the manga, the ponies and the Yu-Gi-Oh CD; that works for me.  Cool; Pink Panther it is then.  I'm certain that you all will enjoy the jugs/washboards/kazoos and boogie-woogie that my papa shared back in 1990 on WTJU.
 
And... I am sorry that I hurt your feelings; I didn't mean to, and I was not being contradicting.  Also, I did not "dismiss" the story, I just gave it consideration, and I offered my honest and open opinion about it.  I did picture your Skitty in your Metune outfit, and I can honestly say that it is a cute idea.  :)  I just feel that the permament (or the world-switch) transformation rubs me the wrong way... How about this, let's say your future daughter is transformed into the skitty of Team Courage, and she and her team time-travel back to aide you and me in our battles and steps towards the future (kind of a Chibi-Usa situation).  And this would happen after we get the seven Crystal Sonichu Balls together, get my imiginary sister out of the mirror, awaken Darkbind's Princess Zelina and put an end to Mary Lee Walsh's terror.  You can provide the new set of villians that Reldnach Notsew Naitsirhc will recruit (after having left the hospital).  Also, Houndour and Absol... let's put Hound-Howl and Apocolypse in those shoes (with the random evolution to Pending Doom and Devolution Spray that Skitty will have).  And I'm not so sure about Charmander on the team... could you go with a Vaporeon, and draw him/her like Hound-Howl or Apocolypse (making a better balanced type-match for the team... Normal, Water, Fire and Dark vs. Normal, Fire X2 and Dark (they would be more weak against ground or water attacks).  Does that work better for you?  I support your cute and fun ideas as much as possible, and I feel a little sad from having hurt your feelings... I'd like to put a smile on my favorite friend's face.  :)
 
Also, how do you feel of the idea of Megagi and Bionic dating behind the comic?
 
And I am flattered that you said that I am a good storyteller; thank you so much.  :)
 
Still caringly fond of you;<br/>
Chris Chan.
 
P.S.
 
Did you read the part in the latest episode where Black Sonichu tells Sonichu about Reldnahc having put whipped cream in his rocket boosters?  In the original drawing, he said "some creamy stuff", in reference to Reldnach being the TOTALLY opposite of me.

Subject: Re: wheee!<br/>

Well, I just heard that the person of RareRomance will have just sent the cards, so maybe by this coming or the next Friday you will have your cards.  :)
 
Another issue, I've just recorded a Battle Theatere from Soul Calibur 3 featuring you Vs. Yosimitsu, as well as me Vs. Mary Lee Walsh and a couple of others.  I will have the Battle Thetere shows in MP4 format soon, and all you to watch them this coming Friday on my PSP.  I've unlocked all the Custom Character Jobs, so everyone is at the highest role.  I started your character as a Ninja, which later unlocked Assassan, which later unlocked Samurai; you are now Samurai Class.  I started as a Saint (because that sounded like basically who I am), then I've got upgraded to Sage (no more beyond that).  Also available were Thief &gt;&gt;&gt; Pirate, Barbarian &gt;&gt;&gt; Gladiator &gt;&gt;&gt; Knight, Dancer, Monk, and the topper, Swordsmaster.  
 
Each Job has a specific number of compatable weapons.  Like for you, as Ninja: Kunai, Katana & Shuriken, Sickle (flexible), and weapons of Taki & Setsuka.  Then as Assassin: Wave Sword, Iron Sword, Chinese Sword, and weapons of Lizardman and Tira.  And NOW as Samurai: Katana (only), Katana & Shuriken, Sickle (flexible), and Weapons of Mitsurugi and Yoshimitsu.  :D
 
I, as Saint, welded: Staff (Personal Weapon of Choice), Dagger, Steel Fan, and Weapons of Zasalamel and Talim.  Now as Sage I get: Chinese Blade, Sword & Shield, Staff, and Weapons of Sophita and Casandra.
 
The list of weapons for each job were listed from lowest level earned to highest (Lv1, Lv10, Lv20 and Lv30).  And my source of information: GameInformer.com.
 
BTW, John was started as Barbarian, and now is Knight.  Also, there was not enough room for "Schroder" in the name spaces, so for both of you, it was shortened to "Schroe"; nothing personal.
 
Well, enough Soul 3 talk.  Let me ask you something, and John may input his opinion for this question as well, Have either of you played Gauntlet 2 or Rampart?  I am asking, because the two games are avilable in the PSNetwork Store, downloable to PS3.  And I wanted your feedback if either or both of you played either one.
 
Oh, I did download the new Super Rub-a-Dub game; it is so cute and fun.  With the Sixaxis, I rotate and shake a tub with the hero Rubber Duckie, and guide it to collect the trapped smaller ducks and lead them to the Drain Exit.  And I have to stay away from the wind-up toy Sharks, unless I'm playing the bonus level as the shark and I would have to eat the ducks.
 
Well, if you find a website where the PGSM episode are downloable with the appropriate format, let me know and I'll get to work on that.  Otherwise, I'm killin' time on PS3 or PSP or DS, or with family.  Here's a cute rhyme-scheme I've made up recently (inspired by a Wii Comercial):
 
"On your (GBA) SP, <br/>
create your Mii, <br/>
and play it on Wii, <br/>
with your PSP,<br/>
hooked to the PS3, <br/>
because it's fun see?"<br/>
 
Okay, I'll check in again later, and I await your next E-Mail.  You all take care.
 
I'm thinkin' of you fondly, sweetie;<br/>
Chris Chan.<br/>
OXOXOX

Subject: Just wanted to warn John...<br/>

I've just learned on the John Tesh Radio Show that people who wear Croc Shoes on escelators are having their toes, toenails gnashed, torn off or worse.  If he is in an area where there is an escelator, encourage him to use an elevator or stairs.
 
I have not received the cards yet, nor have I been able to get that second Manaphy egg yet.
 
I've had a surprise Tuesday while I was sittin' at the Alderman Library (waitin' to be found by a Boyfriend-Free girl).  Some old hag and her bodyguard approached me and made it obvious that it was verbodden to find True Love there.  Who did she think she was; the wife of the Pope?  I disregarded her intrusion, but I am cautious about the possibility of another clash of battle, like in the past with that Witch of PVCC, Mary Lee Walsh, that Jerkief at Fashion Square and the Manajerks at Wal-Mart and Target.  Unlike Tuesday and the previous events, I am much saltier than I was.
 
I will never fall for the FALSE Law of True Love searching and sharing being illegal in the State of Virginia, or in short "Virginia is for Virgins," nor will I quit chillin' at the Library's Lounge Tuesdays and Thursdays with a printed advertisement in the neighborhood.
 
But I digress.  I will see you at the Game Place tomorrow.
 
Take Care;<br/>
Chris Chan.
