[[Tripcode|'''Nurse-kun''' !!hPl7vWPKR+W]] is the handle of a [[b/tard]] who claims to be a registered male nurse.  According  to his story, he works night shifts in an unnamed [[Old people|geriatric]] [[Deadpool|care facility]].  His posts, written in the style of a serial novella, detail his budding [[Obsession|relationship]] with the [[Loli|youngest]] addition to the patient roster: [[Amputee-chan|a seven year old girl]] and [[Acrotomophilia|multiple-amputee whom he's expressed sexual interest in]].  His first [[/b/]] post appeared on the 17th of December, 2006, and had been updated regularly thereafter until June 2nd of 2007, when the posting stopped abruptly. 

==Amputee-chan==
Amputee-chan is the [[Asking for it|prospective victim]] of the [[anonymous]] /b/tard pedophile known as Anonynurse, or Nurse-kun.

According to his [[Lie|story]] she is [[Bullshit|half-Norwegian, half-Japanese, blond, green eyed]], and missing both legs above the knees. She is also missing her right arm below the elbow. She enjoys [[Gamer|gaming]], [[Pedobear|teddy bears]], and long hops on the beach. [[Cockmongler|Turn offs]] include nightmares about her dead parents, losing at [[Weeaboo|DDR]], and professional behavior on the part of medical professionals.

===Reactions===
[[Gullible|Assuming the posts weren't the output of a talented postmodern novelist]], this man is a [[pedophile]]. 

Contrary to his clearly-stated [[Fetish|sexual fantasies and desires]], when /b/tards raised objections to his latent pederasty, Anonynurse stridently protested his innocence. "Much [[lulz]] ensued."  

His /b/ threads have become [[Epic|legendary]].  The two or three hundred replies his posts receive fall into roughly one of four categories:
#I don't [[Habeeb_it|habeeb it]]!
#You are a sick, [[sick fuck]].
#Your story warms my heart because I'm [[Stupid|illiterate and didn't notice that you're a pedophile]].
#Your story warms my heart because I'm a [[pedophile]].

As of the 22nd December, 2006, he'd outlined his plan to win her trust, adopt, and eventually seduce or otherwise molest the girl once she's under his roof.  After being called out and documented, he toned down the sexual angle.  To new readers his later threads seemed perfectly innocent.  This makes them especially creepy to those who had read prior posts.

The story was documented in real time on [[Wikichan]], where it was dubbed "Damaged Goods" however after a server crash all of the fanart was lost and the story was almost lost forever. The story is now being hosted on [[Shii]]'s site that no one cares about, and most recently here on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].

===Lolicon statements===
*"God, she's so cute, she's half-japanese, but has blonde hair, and the rest of her body that didn't get cut away is just perfect, she used to be a gymnast, it seems."
*"Anyway, my question: Should I stick it in her pooper (among other things)? I mean, she isn't going to be able to resist, and I can go in there when she's asleep, then cover up her good eye and mouth before she even knows I'm there, with all the drugs she's on. She's so messed up mentally that she probably wouldn't tell anyone, considering she's barely talked to all the shrinks they've had her seeing since the accident. I'm a pretty gentle guy, and there's plenty of lube around here (obviously), and it'd be pretty easy to clean her up afterward, too."
*"Well, this is why I specified the pooper. I mean, they use adult-size colonoscopies on kid-sized colons, and they aren't sent straight from the imaging department to the ER for [[1guy1jar|OMG RECTAL DISASTER]]."
*"It makes sense, though, because she really hates her wheelchair...the first time I answered one of her calls at night, I'd wheeled it out to put her in it, since that's standard procedure, but she asked me not to use it, so I carried her, instead. I guess that's the first time I thought about her in an illegal manner, really."
*"Ok, OP here: I won't be poopering her in the foreseeable future. I mean, when /b/ can come down at least in the slight minority against doing a barrel roll into a loli, it clearly isn't the right course of action, though I guess I did know that already."
*"Um, I have to admit, she didn't seem to get at all distressed until she may have possibly noticed me looking down there, which I quickly stopped doing, just before I caught her looking away as well, out of my peripheral vision.  I was being pretty unprofessional, it's true, since I'd never had any inclination to look at any other of my patients taking a piss before..."

===Sex denial===
*"There is no coldhearted raping in the forecast. And yes, I am quite aware that any sex with an immature person is rape, 'consenting' or not...and I'm not a fucking rationalizing pedo that'd say 'oh, children can be totally mature as any adult, man...'"
*"I didn't go looking for this situation. Fuck. "
*"Well, to be fair, I haven't raped anyone else so far. [[winnar|Perfect record!]]"
*"For the record, I never actually said I WANTED to stick it in her pooper. Even the remarks I did make were asking /b/ if I SHOULD stick it in her pooper. And providing risk/benefit details for analysis. Through a /b/ filter. But anyway: No, I am not particularly inclined to stick it in her pooper at this moment in time, no. "

==(Finally) The Ending==
Nurse-kun wasn't heard from on 4chan for well over a year, leaving many of his fans hanging and the story unfinished. In late September of 2008 he showed up suddenly in /tg/ in a [http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/2642353/#2644163 thread about Warhammer], where he simply stated:

{{squote|Okay, okay, fine. Summary.

She's doing fine, I'm doing fine, we're doing fine together, in a new place, which we're (well, I'm) renting, her education and various therapies are going quite well.

My father died, my family and I have been dealing with it as best we can, my mom loves her, she likes my mom, and various other members of the family to varying degrees.

I've been working part-time at a new job, and that's going pretty well. She enjoys Avatar, Dawn of War, my Muppet Show DVDs, and we play a mean dual-game of the touhous.

Ze end. Back to discussion of OP's quandry.|Nurse-kun}}
