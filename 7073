[[Image:Rorrsheck.jpg|thumb|Rorschach [[Nod Flenders|OTI]]]]
[[4chan]] Boss '''Rorschach''' was a [[Britfag]] [[Anon|Internets superhero]] who had devoted his [[dying alone| otherwise empty life]] to [[troll]]ing the fuck out of '''the [[HAHAHA|'church']] of $cientology''' and giving them teh [[rAIDS]].

So far he did a pretty good job since [[OSA]]'s quest to find out his [[powerword]], movements, [[fap|routine]] and '[[lulz|crimes]]' for a [[dox]] drop at [[Party Van]] central, has yielded [[FAIL|little]] to [[AIDS|nothing]] other than the basics. I mean, what are you gonna 'get' on an unhinged, unemployed, divorced, oldfag [[b|/b/tard]] who blew all his [[hookers & blow]] money in the late '90s?

On October 30th, 2010, Rorschach [[an hero|took his own life]]. He was survived by his [[Farmville]] account and his [[gun|.45]].

==Out Of The Closet: [[Facefagged|Anon No Moar]]== 

On Thursday 13th 2008, howevar, Co$ decided to emulate another delusional and dysfunctional org, The Bush administration, and go '[[hipster|public]]' with the [[lame|limited]] intel and Rorschach's [[V]] mask was [[facefagged|ripped from his face]] along with two other Project Chanology /b/rothers -'''NigraJustice''' and '''BlvdNights'''- and the jig was up! Anon no moar >:@! 

After some rambling shit (see caps below) making them out to be the Osama bin Laden, Huey P Newton, and Ted Kaczynski of Anon and other crap alluding that if they weren't the the perpetrators of the heinous crimes (such as delivering 'death threats' in the form of artery clogging heart attacks induced by ingestion of all the delicious [[:Image:Spam_pizza.jpg|Spam Pizza]] Anon had kindly sent over), they would be "convicted as accessories" (lol...of what?...helping Co$ call in bomb threats to themselves?) presented in an an accompanying DVD [[crap|'documentary']] called '''"Anonymous Crimes".'''

This srys bidness was rammed home not by [[Party Van]] raids as you'd expect from the [[srys|gravity of the situation,]] but by a Co$ sponsored lame article writing contest about him and his [[anon|superfriends]] '''BlvdNights''' and '''NigraJustice''' on [[TOW]] and  [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Sean_Carasov&diff=1997469788&oldid=1997469403 ED].

===Aftermath===

Although many Anons, were [[shocked and appalled]] at the outing of these three veteran [[Marcabia]]n intergalactic startroopers just a day before [[3/15]], most were simply bemused and amused that a.) [[Scat]]ology had finally [[CS3|learned to Internets]] to access the [[YouTube|INTERNET PROPAGANDA MACHINE]] and b.) figured out the math equation required to get an [[User:Partyhard2008|ED account]].

Unfortunately, they lost [[The Game]] (coincidentally, so have you) when Anon discovered that they still didn't know shit about the Internets and had hired [[Borat|Serbian]] [[skiddies]] to make them look [[win|tits]].

In the end they did what they do best: they poisoned Rorschach's kitty, [[Mudkips]] to get him riled up and primed to troll when he appeared at the Los Angeles protest the next morning. When he arrived he was namefagged by an [[Internet tough guy|OSA]] agent who had filed a complaint with LAPD alleging he'd been [[BAW|criminally flamed]] and was scooped up by the [[police|po-po]] on the resulting arrest warrant.

==My Other Car Is A Longcat==
[[Image:Anonymous-marcab4.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Marcab]] away team, Jake & Elwood Blues.]]
According to the [[tinfoil hat|brain trust]] at The Church of <s>[[Star Trek]]</s> $cientology, Rorschach is not of this Earth and does not come in peace. All the tell-tale signs are there for Scilons to see: he wears a dapper black suit with a white dress-shirt and a narrow tie and tools around town in a [[meth|rocket-powered]] car. Rorschach and [[anon|his ilk]] are an [[spies|"away team"]] for the Scilons' bane, the [[Marcab Confederacy]]. Either that or they are in a [[ska]] band and/or a Blues Brothers tribute band.

Rorschach is in fact the commander [[Marcab Confederacy]]'s [[:Image:Longcat_ship.jpeg|ASF Longcat Deathstar]] leading the 4th (or 5th) Interstellar Invasion Fleet which is currently behind the moon awaiting his [[Party hard|orders]].

==His [[bullshit|Alleged]] Crimes==
[[Image:NYPOST_tomschurchscounterattacks_censored.jpg|thumb|500px|The NY post mentions him!]]
At the 3/15 anti-Co$ demonstration in [[Los Angeles|helLA]] he was arrested at 2pm after getting [[namefag|namefagged]] to the cops by [[Scientologist|Scilon]]s. He was served with an arrest warrant for Code 422 (zOMG [[Serious Business|FELONY CRIMINAL THREATS]]) after a [[BAW|bawwwwwing]] [[Scientologist|Scilon]] showed pix from a Tuesday night protest where Rorschach was photographed flipping a [[Scientologist|placentafag]] [[fuck you|the bird]]. [[bullshit|In fear of his life]], said [[Scientologist|placentafag]] called the [[911|whaaaaambulance]] and filed a complaint, [[true|telling LAPD that Rorschach had threatened to murder him]]. 

Against normal procedure, Rorschach was taken to the local N. Eastern Division rather than downtown to Parker Center central booking. One of the officers then explained that a request had been sent from [[The Man|the brass]] downtown that he be held for questioning by a detective from [[SFB|the Major Case Squad]].

In the middle of questioning said detective produced a phat file on the Final Boss including several Co$ [[spy|surveillance]] pix of him dating back to the L.A. protest scouting mission prior to  [[2/10]] and a [[sock|fake]] user page from [[ED]] featuring a [[shoop]]ed pic of two [[guns]] [[Hax|hacked]] from his [[photobucket]] insinuating that the material was threatening and the reason he'd been arrested. To this Rorschach responded: "As an [[Americunt]] citizen, [[owned|I have a right to bear arms]], my guns are licensed, and I also have the [[GTFO|right to defend myself in my own home]]". 

[[Image:Welcome_mat.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Oh Shi...The 2nd Amendment! Rorschach was subsequently [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:4chan23.png b&] from [[4chan]] for posting this photo on '''/b/''' instead of '''/k/'''. Apparently defending yourself from intruders in your own home makes [[moot|faggot]] cry since he resides in Washington DC where the 2nd Amendment doesn't exist. Plus, since he's an illegal wetback, it wouldn't apply anyway.]] 

She then returned him to the custody of LAPD officers who took him to Parker Center and [[Prison|booked him]]. He was bailed out on $50,000 Canadian (since jail [[I_go_chop_your_dollar|don't chop US dollar]] bail now) and was supposed to be arraigned in court to answer the [[lies|charges]] on April 9th. This would have enabled his legal team - The [[Honorary Ed Lolington]] and [[Phoenix Wright]] - to get a look at the C0$ complaint that led to his arrest along with all 'discovery' (including the LAPD detective's interview about [[true|where he got his haircut and the meaning of his tattoos]] plus whatever bullshit that Co$fag investigators [[nice try|trumped up]] against him). 

[[NORP|Joe Public]] then got [[backraid|mighty pissed off]] at the waste of taxpayer dollars on yet another frivolous Co$ [[lolsuit]]. And with the price regular gas in Cali being almost $4 a gallon, we imagine that [[Co$]] got a big bill from the FBI since the [[Party Van]] gets lousy mileage.

===His Actual Crimes===
*Voted for [[Ralph Nader]] in 2000
*Lieks [[Mudkips]]
*Is a [[B|/b/tard]]
*Once called his mum a homo and got hit with a shoe.
*Took his mask off for 5 seconds to scratch his nose.
*Broke [[drunk|Rule 17]] on [[2/10]]

==Co$ killed Rorschach's cat [[Mudkips]] NEVAR 4GET==
{{notice|The following is, unfortunately, 100% true}}
On the night of March 13th, shortly after Rorschach's [[dox]] were dropped by [[Scientology|Scilons]], [[David Miscavige|someone]] poisoned the dry food Rorschach leaves out for the feral cats in his neighborhood by spiking it with ammonia. The cat that died had answered to [[Mudkips]], no, seriously. :(

</pre>

[[Longcat]] personally put out a bounty of [[over 9000]] [[internets]] for any information that leads to the arrest and/or [[Buttsecks|sodomy]] of the [[sick fuck|cat killer]].

==[[Fair Game]] Policy==

[[Scientology|Scilons]] are quick to point out that the "Fair Game" policy set out by L. Ron Hubbard in 1965 stating that [[Insane|"The homes, property, places and abodes of persons who have been active in attempting to: suppress Scientology or Scientologists are all beyond any protection of Scientology Ethics, unless absolved by later Ethics or an amnesty ... this Policy Letter extends to suppressive non-Scientology wives and husbands and parents, or other family members or hostile groups or even close friends"]] had been [[Lies|rescinded]] in 1968, meaning of course they are [[lies|no longer involved in such activities]]. However, a closer look reveals that L. [[Ron Jeremy]] only rescinded the use of the words "Fair Game" and not the tactics. As can be seen after the latest round of extra-legal harassment of [[lawl|law]] abiding citizens by the Co$ due to the [[Anonymous|anon]] protests it is clear to anyone with normal mental capacity (Read: < [[aspie|clear or OT]]) that the [[Scientology|Co$]] are still up to their old [[Faggotry|dirty tricks]].

Rorschach is the [[oldfag]] to end all [[oldfag]]s, and is also [[The_Chemo_That_Is_Curing_/b/|the Chemo that is curing /b/]]. If any of you [[newfags]] have a doubt about his lulz credentials, look no further.

{{tinyquote|In addition to his literary accomplishments, the Captain went on to work in the [[porn|adult film business]]; which he found to be less [[whore|sleazy]] than working in the [[RIAA|music industry]]. He scouted porn locations and was offered a mainstream publicity gig at Metro. However, [[butthurt|he turned it down]] and went to do the same for Shane's World (it is always good to have something to [[heroin|fall back on]]).
