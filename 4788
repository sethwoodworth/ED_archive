'''Legeacy Universe . net''' is a [[lie|pathetic]] site set up by [[ban|disgruntled]]  [[dipshit|BC Central]] members because they cant stand the [[fascism]] and [[faggotry]] of that [[truth|pesky site]]

LU is most famous for the [[lulz]] and [[drama]] it exports to other boards.

It also features numerous [[geek|geeky]] sub-forums and engorges in its overall depravity.

The founder is well known for being an [[god|utter genius]] and sees it as his personal duty to [[for the lulz|piss everyone off]].
The membercount is [[over 9000]]


==History==

*The [[drama]] started when the [[unwarranted self importance|staff]] decided to take up a crusade against the [[lulz]] and focus on [[serious business]]. Numerous members, doing it [[for the lulz]] were banned. This is when LU was created.

==Stuff==

Legacy Universe features a diverse range in topics such as [[boobs]], [[geek|geekstuff]], [[star trek]] and of course [[drama]]. Users, referred to as ''loyal subjects'' or ''feeble human prey'' are banished to the [http://legacyuniverse.net/index.php?board=13.0 The Colony] to be preyed on by [[faggots]] and [[zombies]]. [[Butthurt]] gheys have been rumored to roam the site, to ever be trolled (moar like [[template:lern|lernin to internet]], [[amirite]]?) by the populace. Also there is a place people are [[Lie|not supposed to talk about]].

Trolling on LU is practically impossible, because nothing is [[serious business]] there. Those who become [[faggots|buttehurt]], are left to [[awesome|fend for themselves under vicious trolling and zombie attacks]].
