Sepia
{{Pixpls}}
'''Sepia''' is the brownish tint found in photos from back when [[George Washington]] used to make [[hawt]] [[pr0n]] [[pic]]s with [[your mom]]. The brownish tint came from the fact that [[poop]] constantly got on every photo because in those days, nobody knew how to wipe their [[ass]].

==Use on the Internets==
Today, sepia-ed photographs can be found all over [[teh internets]]. This is because the option is not only available in [[Adobe]] [[Photoshop]] and every other photo [[edit|editing]] [[software]], but also because it's so easy even a [[camwhore]] can do it. Some claim it's a [[cool]] style, but those [[people]] are [[n00bs]]. Sepia is [[gay]] and is only used because it hides [[acne]], the most common [[internet disease]].

Sepia should only ever be applied on four occassions.

*If you work a booth at a crappy park and make suburban families cute little Wanted Posters so they can pretend to be [[cowboys]].

*If you have a [[fetish]] for vintage [[pr0n]] and ran out of old stuff.

*Using sepia to mock someone/someone's work or to simply ruin a picture on purpose.

*For adding a dramatic effect to images [[srsly]] lacking in [[drama]].
