'''Yahoo''', an invented persona and [[furry|mascot]], is a [[search engine]], website and trademark. The name was first developed when [[Brian Peppers]] squeezed a young boy's nuts and he screamed "Yahoo!"  The creators of Yahoo (who were 100% [[redneck]]) decided this was a great name for a company, and they went for it.  That's the real reason why it is called Yahoo.  The following is a shitty reason.

Company executives chose the name "Yahoo" because it seemed warm and friendly to them. At first "Yahoo" was used to provide the simulation of a personal signature to replies to customers asking advice. <s>Yahoo also does not allow ED to be found in its searches. Go ahead, try it.</s> [http://uk.search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=AhOPbHLOjzPYljswieVCiho4hJp4?vc=&p=Encyclopedia+dramatica&toggle=1&cop=mss&ei=UTF-8&fr=yfp-t-702 DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]

==Yahoo Profiles==
July 28, 2009, Yahoo decided to make a change to its profiles.  Now if you have a yahoo email account, yahoo forcibly puts all of your [[dox|real name and address]] on your profile publicly for everyone to see.  The only way to get it off is hunt down a hidden menu wherein no matter what you enter, the form will say "invalid response".  The form also has a human unreadable [[CAPTCHA]] on it so as to trick people into thinking they must keep retrying that thing until they go blind, but the joke's on them because the form is simply un-submittable.  Many people on the internet have reported to spending over 12 hours nonstop trying to get their profile off.

== Yahoo Mail and their CAPTCHA ==
[[Image:Yahoo_does_wrong.jpg|thumb|right|Yahoo gets it wrong]]
Whenever you try to send mail on Yahoo, you have to enter a [[CAPTCHA]] which, much like [[Google]]'s, are completely unreadable. Yahoo's at first appears readable but 99% of the time it will tell you that [[Doing it wrong|you got it wrong]].  Yahoo noticed that 100% of its support requests were complaints about their shithouse [[CAPTCHA]] so, in an epic attempt to further gyrate their users,  Yahoo then implemented the same [[CAPTCHA]] system before anyone could contact Yahoo.

The solution, of course, is that Yahoo puts their fax numbers on its website. Just go ahead and use a [http://faxzero.com free fax site] and send Yahoo support requests by fax.  They love this!

== Paedophiles on Yahoo ==
[[Image:Yahoo_mongler.jpg|thumb|right|Desperate for internet money by pandering to btards.]]
[[Image:Yahoo_vacant.jpg|thumb|right|[[lie|LIARS]]]]
Yahoo is considered paradise for paedophiles, lesbians, and nerds, but mostly paedophiles. The paedophile rate has doubled, especially in Yahooligans, Dating Chat rooms, and in computer viruses (thank you Bill Gates) and Canadians. Also, [[Perverted Justice]] has also raided Yahoo for paedophiles (without a search warrant). If you are a paedophile, find and kill all the staff of NBC for invading your privacy. If not, kill the staff of NBC anyway.

==Trolls on Yahoo==
Yahoo, despite being insignificant and obsolete on all levels each due to a different competitor, is not without its trolls. One particular user, Inkybob, takes great delight in harassing [[Christians]] in Yahoo groups, which makes her both edgy and [[hardcore]].  Maybe one day she'll see the same fate as [[Ripper|another other hardcore guy]].

Yahoo Sports, also is plagued by this [[faggotry]], in the form of [[trying too hard|Stinger]] and his [[sockpuppets|copycats]] [[spam|spamming]] [[christian|Tim Tebow]] sucks on any sports article they can. 

Yahoo News, being completely unmoderated, is the perfect place for wannabe trolls to hang out.  A typical discussion will feature nothing to do with the story and will instead be full of [[Unfunny|crap jokes]] posted [[at least 100]] times, [[Desu]] [[Desu]] [[Desu]], [[fundies]] cracking on about [[Jesus]], [[racism]], [[butthurt]] and generally some of the most pathetic [[shit]] you will ever find on the internet. [[Ever]].

==Flooding==
[[Image:Yahoofailmemes.jpg|thumb|right|Fail usage of memes is fail.]]Flooding has resulted in some rooms being closed down with flood bots for over 3 years. Evidence suggests as much as 50% of the bots on Yahoo! are due to [[No_friends|Vincntvangogh]], a botmeister, being proven ignorant during an intellectual debate by [[Genius|emcandela]] [[Narcissistic_personality_disorder|Vinc]] was subsequently [[ate my balls|teabagged]] by [[Morrissey]].

==Malicious Mayhem==
Yahoo Messenger/Chat, also known as Ya[[Whore]], has been frequent [[rape|targets]] of the [[1337]] community of Yahoo. [[Programming|People with way too much time on their hands]] develop programs that can produce epic [[lulz]] such as kicking people out of rooms, [[brute forcing]] Yahoo user names, and flooding the chat room.

==Yahoo Is Better Than [[You]]==
