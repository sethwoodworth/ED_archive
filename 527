AnoniWork
'''DEADWEBSITE IS DEAD ''' A shittier rip off of an already shitty site, [http://www.anoniwork.com/ AnoniWork] provides somewhere to [[BAWWWWW|whine]] about your [[job]] to other [[anon]].  Although there is potential for much [[lulz]] it is essentially just a [[theft|copypasta from AnoniDate]]. 
Anoniwork was started sometime in late [[2007]], [[nobody]] knows why. Avoid. Domain seems to point to localhost.
