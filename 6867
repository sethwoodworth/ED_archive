A '''reaction face''' (aka a '''my face when''' or '''mfw''') thread or post is one of the longest living virulent [[cancer|tumours]] of [[the cancer that is killing /b/]] dating back to the [[2004|early days]] of /[[b]]/ and as such it appears to be 100% immune to [[chemo]].

The '''reaction face''', '''[[this was my face when I saw (x)]]''' or '''this is my /b/ face''' is quite simply a fucking boring, lazy [[shitpost]] that involves nothing more than posting a random image of an expressive face either from the stockpile of [[old meme]] images in your /[[b]]/ folder or a quick [http://www.google.com/images?q=reaction+face&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&start=0&uss=1 Google image search].

'''Reaction face''' threads are usually set into [[crapflood]] mode whenever [[m00t]] tweaks /b/ in some way like he did with [[DUN DUN]].

==The many reaction faces==
We have here a collection of reaction pics to add to your collection for when venture down to [[4chan]]. Save it, print it, smoke it, fuck it; we don't give shit.
