LJ user {{lj|Chaos_wraith_x}} was, until recently, a boring and unimportant member of the Internets community. He still is, but now he has an article. Why? Well, he managed to piss off [[Son of art]], renowned pseudo-pagan and King of the Sockpuppets. As [[Dani Faulk]] or [[Kevin and Kat]] can tell you, the consequences of pissing off Son of art are dire. Since he has nothing to do but eat off ugly women's money and masturbate into his owl helmet. He has the time and energy to generate massive amounts of verbose, overdone, made-up bullshit, which would be fine except none of it is even remotely funny. The [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Chaos_wraith_x&oldid=1997342937 original version] tells the sad tale: Robin Artisson is the cancer that is killing ED, and articles like this are why. We've tried to preserve the original character and charm of Mr. Artisson's work, just so you can appreciate his sparkling wit and excellent graphic design sensibilities.

==Dramatis Resume Virtualis==

Dramatis what? Who writes this shit?

Anyway, the anti-lulz started when Son of Art, under the name {{lj|owl_clan}}, decided it was time to take on those damn Muslims, since everybody's been giving them a free pass so far. [http://community.livejournal.com/darkpaganism/569619.html His post] was a marvel of tl;dr, notable for the author's complete inability to say one funny thing about the hilariousness of some bitch going to prison over a teddy bear. The local Dark Pagans got really really mad and totally put a hex on him, or at least they will once they get their DVD players working again so they can look up the relevant scenes in ''The Craft''.

In response, {{lj|chaos_wraith_x}} [http://community.livejournal.com/darkpaganism/569864.html did a lot of yelling] and Son of Art yelled back, and then eventually this article was created. [[User:Mori|Mori]] deleted it, because she deletes everything, which led Arty to call her Chaos's [http://i130.photobucket.com/albums/p269/stigma_black/ThreatFull.png ghey lover] and then make vague scaaaaary threats.

Arty keeps coming back to edit this article with various sockpuppets, no matter how many times the mods raep him, which is the single best argument against open account creation on ED.

==Timeless Wisdom from a Fucking Troll==

See, the funny thing about LiveJournal is that it assigns semi-random numbers to each journal entry, with each entry having a higher number than the previous one. So if, say, {{lj|darkpaganism}} is currently up to entry #571218, and you've got a troll inserting links to entry #1265919, like [http://community.livejournal.com/darkpaganism/1265919.html this] you know that entry probably doesn't exist.

This article has been edited to remove a shitload of tl;dr made-up shit from LJ entries that not only don't exist now, but have ''never'' existed. Dear [[Son of art]]: SCREENCAPS OR GTFO.

LJ entries also do not begin with [http://community.livejournal.com/honestyisabitch/0944558.html zero], dumbfuck.

Also, because nobody has ever had a fucked-up dream before in the history of the universe, let's throw in this random crap from [http://21six.net/?p=28 his lame website]:

{{quote|I don’t remember my dreams very often. So I feel the need to share this one with EVERYONE. EVER.

I was in the kitchen of a place that wasn’t my old house, or any old apartment of mine, but it still felt kind of familiar. While in the kitchen, I heard on the radio that Jesus was out killing everyone who had cancer–I then later saw him flying around outside from a window in the kitchen and decided that I was going to trap him in my microwave.

Which I did.

So, Jesus was trapped in my microwave, though I hadn’t actually pressed any of the buttons to activate it. I had come to the conclusion that he would escape if I turned it on. I put a little piece of paper with “Do Not Touch!” over the panel of buttons on the side.

That’s when Lisa Simpson came and told me that we need to convince Jesus to help us cure cancer, instead of killing Jesus or keeping him locked away in a microwave forever. I informed Lisa that she was trying entirely too hard to be a good person, and was obviously overcompensating for something she had done in her past. I also told her shut up.

Then I woke up.|OMG CALL THE DRAMA SQUAD}}

==The Internets Court is Serious Business==
Chaos_Wraith_X [http://community.livejournal.com/internetscourt/6067.html prosecutes] the {{ljcomm|user=stupid_free}} [[lj]] [[community]] in this "transcript", and really thinks that he's clever by bringing up [[godwin's law]].<br/><br/>
<b>
"{{ljcomm|user=stupid_free}} has been charged with being "cyber bullies".

The counsel in this case is:<br/>
{{lj|user=chaos_wraith_x}} as the prosecutor.<br/>
{{lj|user=azeraphael}} as the defense.<br/><br/>

What follows a transcript of the proceedings.<br/><br/>

[08:47 PM] {{lj|user=chaos_wraith_x}}: Due to moral reasoning, the plaintiff drops all charges.<br/>
[08:47 PM] {{lj|user=chaos_wraith_x}}: I can't argue on behalf of a furry.<br/>
[08:47 PM] {{lj|user=azeraphael}}: IN SO MUCH AS --ERK!<br/>
[08:47 PM] {{lj|user=chaos_wraith_x}}: That's like Hitler trying to argue on behalf of a Jew.<br/>
[08:47 PM] {{lj|user=wooldridge}}: GODWIN'S LAW<br/>
[08:47 PM] {{lj|user=wooldridge}}: TRIAL OVER<br/>

<br/>
Result:<br/>
All charges dropped."</b>

The stenographer would like to note that whoever originally wrote this article fails at wiki-markup. BREAK TAGS ARE NOT TOYS.

==Chaos_wraith_x [[banhammer|BAN HAMMERS]] {{lj|user=our_lady_rissa}} before his [[faggot]] court==

<B>
"Recently {{lj|user=our_lady_rissa}} was banned from my personal journal, as a policy enforcement. She's decided to appear before the court today to appeal her ban.

Specifically, the policy violation is as follows:

Policy 225
Any user posting the merits of Naruto, or making profound use of weeaboo mannerisms (including the rampant butchering of English and Japanese involved in that hideous SUGOI-KAWAII-DESU mix), will be immediately and permanently banned. Memes are exempt from this policy."
</b>

ED Court later upheld this ruling, because weeaboos suck. The author of this article, however, was fined for contempt of court by using the fucking bold tag.

What follows are the accounts that [[Son of art|Robin Artisson]] is convinced belong to Chaos wraith x. Since Robin himself has over 9000 sockpuppet accounts, plus his meatpuppet followers, it's natural that he might get the lines blurred between "friendship" and "people inside your head."

So, basically, half of fucking LiveJournal. The other half, of course, belong to Arty himself.
