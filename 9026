'''WikiFur[http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/WikiFur:Trade_and_service_marks ®]''' is a [[wiki]] that, in theory, categorizes and chronicles the perversions of [[furries]], but in practice is a one-sided [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/101983/#cid:651782 ignorant] [[crap]]fest where they slag on [[mundane]]s and boost their own pathetic [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] ego like a ''Twilight Zone'' episode of [[Encyclopediadramatica|Æ]]. Of course, it pales in comparison to the furry articles on [[Wikipedia]] that are controlled by [[ContiE]], the leader of the [[Furluminati]].

Originally Wikifur® was just one site and it was easy for any [[closet furry]] to vandalize the site out of a Freudian denial that he was a furry in the same way that [[Chris-chan|some closet gays are extremely homophobic]]. That was long ago and today if you go to their site wikifur.com, the first thing you'll notice is that it's not just one WikiFur, but it's now in at least sixteen different languages. Basically, so many wikifurs® that it's impossible to troll or vandalize them all. And what's more, it means membership in the furry community is growing!

==Wikifur®, The Most Efficient Furry Trollsite==
[[Image:Miw-raeg.png|thumb|right|150px|Even furries go batshit about WikiFur® for raising trolling to a new level.]]
Really, what is the big deal about WikiFur®?
Actually, nobody likes WikiFur® for the reason we have developed here, but even less the furries themselves. 
On a poll started on Furaffinity forums last year, WikiFur® scored far worse than ED, lulz.net or even patriotic nigras, all famous sites devoted to fursecution! Yet none of those are as defamatory as WikiFur®. 
How? Why? for a simple reason:

WikiFur® is a wiki, just like ED, or wikipedia: you can post whatever you want there. 
Here on Ed, we target drama, delivers personal information which has been given out publicly about those who deserved it. All information here is provided for the lulz.
But WikiFur®'s acts goes further than ED! Yes, you heard right!
Being undercover by total anonymity and ruled by intentionally designed autistic douche bags such as GreenRaeper or Spirou, this good-willing website aiming for the furry fandom's first place is the most annoying thing ever for this community!
Take a random artist, or person, drawing a pet dog may it be professional, random, unintentional, whatever. 
The artist decides to turn him into a character. A toony one, totally innocent drawing that has been posted on a random site. Photobucket, Myspace, Deviant or 4chan's /ic/ board.

The furry, in his perpetual quest for yiff finds this pic and is happy to see a new member in his fandom.
Disregard the quality the poor dog drawing got reposted on fchan, lulz, paws... the author dramatically left pics, identity, dox.
So, the furry files the person as another furry artist just like the STASI would file an enemy of the regime.

And now the author surprisingly receives invitations to create an fa account, requests, yiff commissions with a given price (draw me for 5 bux coz your not famous)...role-plays, weird questions and for some reason, lost his job and friends. 

I'm exaggerating but, if you use google, by example; it's pretty easy to find you and especially the way WikiFur® is referenced on the search engines!

To the furry who actually read this page:
WikiFur® hates your privacy. and you thought ED is bad?
We believe in lulz, we do it for it. 
WikiFur® wants to be the reference, accurate and professional, so, take a different look and think, who is your enemy?

If you got filed on WikiFur®; you cannot technically avoid it. Admins act like asspies and say it's information, encouraging you to keep it.
He will never really erase it unless you have a good lawyer.

(yes, this is immoral but remember, furries, non-humans have no rights.)

Trying to edit your own WikiFur®, such as blanking, will get you reverted, ending into edit wars as shown above.

(face it, your complaint mail wont even be read by GreenRaeper, it will just make things worse if you contact this ambiguous person and you'll be laughed at on these guy's irc channel.)

The only real way, contact their webhost. only them will really have the power to keep you more or less safe. That's why they moved from Wikia to their own site.

Remember, if you flirt with the furry, whoever you are, they will find you. Your fetishes will be discussed, your style analyzed, to please you all bad things about you will be reverted to keep make you in trust with GreenRaeper's site.
Your doggy char is now a cuntboy because you omitted drawing him an harbl, your drawing is now yourself, this is your fursona, your motivations about the furry are debated, all in a very correct, moderated and informal mood. For the rest of the world you'll be assimilated in the furry fandom and be labeled as a zoophile.

At this point, say no to initiate "greenraeper_engineered_drama". Butthurt by your insubordination for being a bad furry, your article may list all annoying sites with your nick registered nearby your high school and irl identity. If not you still be at least labeled as a mundane, but it doesn't change anything about your internet rep.

. . . and all you wanted to do is to draw a funny doggy character.

==The Shittiest Articles==
* [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Category:Paraphilias A list of all the fucked-up paraphilias that inhabit the furry world. Note how few they've decided to name]
* [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Category:Mature_terms Gimme MOAR!]
* [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Category:Rated_NC17 MOAR!!]

Because they try to avoid [[butthurt]] at all costs (even though they [[FAIL]] miserably), WikiFur® only lists a few of the fetishes furries all over the [[interbutts]] indulge in - claiming that being a furry is [[lies|non-sexual]] or at least [[rape|consensual]].

Noticeably they actually admitted that [[bestiality]] is part of the furry fandom. About fucking time.

If you should come across these pages, be sure to [[troll|gently point out their flaws]] for [[great justice]].

<b>NOTE:</b> <i>Most of these crimes against nature have their own article. It's because there wasn't enough space on a single webpage to document just how low these cumbuckets could sink.</i>



===C-Snakes===
These are apparently little parasites that eat you body, mind, and soul. The "C" stands for [[cum]]. No, I [[shit]] you not - someone, somewhere is getting turned on by the thought of being eaten from the inside out.

[[Srsly]]. These hairy shit-sacks take this burning pile of [[cum]]-splattered garbage far too seriously. They even have a list of clothes to wear.

===RottenFurs===
Furries that even other furries find unacceptable. Which after reading the articles on WikiFur® must be pretty fucking sick.

== Center of self love (a.k.a. The WikiFur® drinking game) ==
[[Image:Wikifurmasturbation.png|left|thumb|And the sound of fapping was heard for miles.]]

WikiFur® is saturated by the semen of countless furries [[masturbation|masturbating]] furiously. A fun drinking game can be played to their chronic wanking and [[shameless self promotion]].

Simply pick any one random article from the [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Category:People People] section, and check the edit history. Take one shot if you find a history page with the same user on WikiFur® having edited it [[at least 100|at least 100 times]]. Take three shots if you find a user that's edited it less than twice. Take five shots where obvious [[WikiEdit Drama]] has taken place.  Take ten shots if you find a history page where the same user has ''not'' edited their own article. Repeat until tanked. Win the [[Internets]] if you last longer than three minutes.

Of course, not one entry in the entire database details the darker side of any furry, nor their various perversions; any user caught telling the truth about another is immediately accused of [[fursecution]] and subjected to the [[banhammer]]. Some furries [http://nothingkat.livejournal.com/49215.html?thread=446271 think different] - but then, they're furries!
<br clear="all" />

== Overnight popularity, moar liek overweight popularity ==
[[Image:Wikifurvandalism.png|thumb|WikiFur®'s Main Page]]
[[Image:Fun_with_Wikifur.png|thumb|Moar fun with WikiFur®]]

Having gained way too many articles in less than three weeks due to none of the editors having lives or standards, it had already generated a tremendous amount of [[drama]]. Just two days after being promoted, it was made into [[Something Awful]]'s ''Awful Link of the Day'', which may have some connection to its growth in "[[Drama|popularity]]". Another reason is its [[Google Adwords]] [[advertising]], which led to great [[lolz]] when [[GMail]] started telling people to go there while reading their secret furry [[hentai]] subscription.

== WikiFur® on Wikipedia ==

===Links to WikiFur® to be classified as spam by Wikipedia===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:External_links&oldid=138939926#Wikifur There is a huge debate going on at Wikipedia in the external links page] where they are considering blocking links to WikiFur® as spam. They say "WikiFur® is a site for people who follow the furry sexual lifestyle". Showing that instead of reading Wikipedia's own articles on furries, they came straight to ED.

Someone mentioned, "some of the articles it [links to WikiFur®] was on were weird. Taxidermy and Kopa standing out." Now WikiFur® doesn't have a taxidermy article, but they do have an "Anthropomorphic taxidermy", which isn't regular taxidermy, but instead it's the same thing as what's described in the ED article [[taxidermy]].

"I am a furry and I consider WikiFur® to be a terrible source or external link. The wiki is, to say the least, kind of sketchy. I know a number of people who have articles on WikiFur® and they are often poorly written, highly biased, do no reflect reality, etc. There are several articles on people who are disliked in the furry community which are poorly written, and a lot of furry authors have glowing articles, probably written by themselves or their friends. The whole Wiki is not a reliable source of information, and just because you have 8,000 monkeys typing doesn't mean that they're going to produce something Wikipedia can use. -Perhaps- we could use it for limited purposes, such as stating what at least some furries think, but it is not an acceptable source of information and promoting it via Wikipedia is unethical at best. Wikipedia has high standards, and WikiFur® does NOT meet our standards. Titanium Dragon 09:10, 18 June 2007 (UTC)"

==Vandalism Ideas==
First idea.....

Everybody does blatant vandalism on WikiFur®, but nobody does sneaky. Make an account there. WikiFur® isn't all elitist about high edit counts like [[Wikipedia]]. So you make a WikiFur® account and go around doing ordinary edits mixed in with sneaky vandalism. See how long the sneaky lasts. Don't be obvious like making your vandalism look like trolling.  Don't touch any ED-related articles or you'll look from ED, that include their articles on ED, anything anti-furry, their article on [[Prince Jeremy]], and WikiFur®'s article on [[Blu Aardvark]] -- just avoid those so you look like the normal furfag or [[closet furry|closet-furfag]] or [[diaperfur]] of their site.  WikiFur® is now so [[butthurt]] that Tor and proxys are blocked from editing.

Beware though, too much time on the site, even vandalizing, will turn you furry and soon you'll be fapping to [[:Image:Holychristfurfags.jpg|this]] as you're donating to WikiFur®.  Now you may be going, "Yeah right, couldn't happen to me."  But it will, just take [[Thedreadedkettle]] for instance.

==WikiFur® in other languages==
[[Image:anime_furry_nazis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|in a nutshell]]
http://wikifur.com/ links to thirteen WikiFur® sites, each in its own language. All the foreign WikiFur® sites are written in [[moonspeak]], and only the German one, lead by [[ContiE]], is recognizable through its excess of [[Nazi furs]] scat porn.
