'''Higurashi''' ([[Shit nobody cares about|known fully as "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni," or by its English translation: "When the Cicadas Cry", or by its shitty DVD English translation: "When They Cry"]]) is yet another [[animu|anime]] series that has ended up spawning a fanbase that encourages RPers to engage in [[Cosplay|cosplay]] and draw [[Lolicon|lolicon]] fanart of its characters, kill parents who are cops with axes, and fap to loli prOnz, courtesy of [[Japan|Japan]] (as if we needed any more of this [[Desu|retarded shit]]). The series is best known for its awful attempts to deliver gore, freaky insane characters with various [[Retard|personality disorders]], and surprisingly high amounts of [[kawaii|kawaii-ness]]... or something like that. Also noted are the many facets of [[quality|QUALITY]] in which the characters have fucktardedly huge heads in comparison to the rest of their bodies. 

==The Usual Episode Cycle...==
After watching the first of many painful episodes of the first season (and assuming you've already taken note of the fact that the seasons are divided into a few story arcs) you may begin to notice the following pattern that provides the main structure of the plot...

In each story arc, the first one or two episodes consist of typical anime-style girly nonsense that makes the eyelid of any sane person twitch just a little. The next episode may consist of less faggotry and [[moar]] [[srs bzns|serious business]] as the plot begins to slowly escalate the level of drama as more mysterious shit is discovered and one or more of the characters is consumed in paranoia because they believe supernatural shit is coming to rape their soul (this crap can take several episodes to play out before reaching the end of the story arc). Eventually, one (or sometimes more) of the characters either becomes [[An Hero|an hero]] or kills another character and the story arc ends. That pretty much sums it up. The cycle continues a few times (resetting reality over and over again as if nothing happened) and then season one ends, just like that. It's less of a story and more of an introduction to a few fictional characters and some of the various ways they get killed, including a reset button to top it all off. Seriously.

Season two attempts to cover season one's ass by filling in most of the plot holes, but it's complicated to explain it, as it contains a bunch of confusing philosophical shit that's impossible to understand. Also, [[The Game|the game]].

==The Cast of Higurashi==
*'''[[Gay|Keiichi Maebara]]''': Pretty much the only guy in the series. Sorry fags.

*'''[[Batshit insane|Rena Ryuguu]]''': Token batshit insane character. [[Pretty cool guy|Seh murders with a butcher's knife and doesn't afraid of anything]]. She also thinks everything is OMGSOKAWAII and [[Kleptomania|wants to take it home]].

*'''[[Loli|Rika Furude]]''': The other loli. [[Lesbian|She lives with Satoko]], which is just an excuse for the directors to [[Sick fuck|insert their own personal sex fantasy]].

*'''[[Loli|Satoko Houjou]]''': One of the two lolis of the show who has been [[Rape|raped]] by [[Incest|her uncle]] several times. You get to see her in panties in season two. [[Fap|*fap*fap*fap*]]

*'''[[Incest|Shion and Mion Sonozaki]]''': [[Tits or gtfo|Tits or GTFO]]

*'''[[God|Hanyuu]]''': A third loli introduced in season 2. [[Shit nobody cares about|She's behind the time loop or some shit]].
