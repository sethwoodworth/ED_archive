'''[http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=44515158 Carlos "Run Run" Sousa Jr.]''' was a fucktarded 17-year-old wannabe [[gangster|thuglife cholo]] from [[beaner|San Jose]] who taunted '''[[Tatiana the Tiger]]''' at the [[San Francisco]] Zoo on Christmas Day 2007 by [[Asking for it|throwing rocks and pine-cones at her and sticking his leg into the exhibit area]]. To his dismay, the [[Longcat|tiger jumped across the moat]], used the Mexican's leg as a makeshift rope, and climbed out. The kid got his punk ass promptly [[NOM NOM NOM|chewed]], becoming [[an hero]] by tiger proxy.

23-year-old '''Kulbir Dhaliwal''' was actually the IRL [[Hate Machine]]'s appetizer. As the tiger clawed and bit his Tandoori ass, Sousa and the younger brother, Amritpal "Paul" Dhaliwal, 19, [[HAHAHA|yelled in hopes of scaring it off him]], police said. The cat then went for the main course, slashing Sousa's neck and ripping off his face as the brothers ran to a zoo cafe to smoke moar [[pot|trees]] and drink some [[beer|forties]].

After killing Sousa, the tiger followed a trail of marinated [[cake|blood]] left by Kulbir about 300 yards to the cafe, where it [[pwnt|mauled both men]] for [[delicious cake|dessert]].

Shortly afterwords, the [[police|5-0]] arrived and found the cat [[NOM|sitting next to one of the bloodied brothers]]. The victim yelled, [[BAWWWW|"Help me! Help me!"]] and the animal resumed its attack.

As the cops used their patrol car lights to distract the tiger, it turned and began approaching them, leading all four to [[shit bricks]] and [[kill it with fire|go '''187''' on the motherfucker's ass]].

A witness now claims that she saw the boys earlier with slingshots, and they were [[lion|attempting to taunt a lion]]. Police also found an empty bottle of [[Jenkem]] in a car the boys used that day.

Be prepared for another [[BAWWW|sob-fest]] filled with speeches of how the teenager is a perfect little angel, and a lawsuit to collect some IRL [[money|jewgold]]. Meanwhile, online communities everywhere are mourning Tatiana over the dead li'l '''thuglife''' gobshite by about 99:1.

'''Recent shenanigans:''' October 9th 2007:''' Kulbir and Paul [[Indian|Dhaliwal]] (the two twats with Sousa) were charged with misdemeanor for being [[drunk|fucked up to the gills]] and [[Don't Taze Me Bro|resisting a police officer]] after they were arrested.

Kulbir Dhaliwal allegedly kicked the shit out of a security partition between the back and front seats in a police car after being handcuffed in the incident.

After these two get the [[The Gorillaz|band]]-[[aids]] off the munch bites out of their respective asses, they have to show up for these charges January 15th 2008.

{{quote|The reports indicate they were extremely belligerent with police|Steuart Scott, the deputy district attorney}}

According to authorities, after the zoo attack the two surviving "darlings" refused to give their own names, identify the victim or give authorities [[Never drinking again|an account of what occurred]]. This lack of cooperation, coming so soon after their friend had just been turned into a human Pez dispenser by a flesh eating [[furry]], [[Sarcasm|in no way implies that they did anything wrong]], although [[some argue|some have suspected]] that the issue was more an act of self-preservation - not due to the underage drinking, but to avoid being deported due to [[Mexican|lack of green cards]].

It is now reported that the two [[India|Indian]] brothers have hired one time [[Michael Jackson]] attorney Marc Geragos and [[irony|plan to sue the San Francisco Zoo for injuries as the result of something that they caused themselves]].

== Faggtory dug up on the Dhaliwal brother, Lolsuit filed as predicted by ED! ==

On March 27th 2007, one of the brothers was caught stealing a set of [[Wii]] game controllers by stuffing them in his pants at the San Leandro California [[Wal-Mart|Target]] store.  
He was subsequently cavity searched, booked, and released on a bail of $1500.
Incidentally, [http://www.mercurynews.com/crime/ci_12480242 they won] a lolsuit filed against the San Francisco Zoo that same day, as predicted by ED.  Maybe they couldn't wait for the settlement to buy those Wii controllers. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/22/BAAG1099RG.DTL]

===EPIC FAILURE CONVICTION===
After fucking around for a couple of months, the IRL judge finally threw the [[banhammer|book]] at the sand nigger Paul Dhaliwal, with five counts of [[I accidentally|felony]].
Most of the rights he will lose won't be missed by this gangsta wanna be, since homies are too poor / stupid to travel anyways, let alone figure out how voting works.
The exception is that he will never have a chance at being more than a petty thug, as his gun privilege has been revoked.  
ED predicts a career of robbing 7/11 and KFC's using Airsofts and Super Soakers.

===I'm Sorry Ms. Miller. I am FOR REALZ===

[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/01/03/MN9TU8AGC.DTL January 3rd 2008:] Jennifer Miller was with her husband and two children at the zoo and saw the Dhaliwal Brothers acting like [[Fucktards]] Christmas Day.

{{tinyquote|The boys, especially the older one, were roaring at them. He was taunting them.  They were trying to get that lion's attention. ...

===Supa Secret Pact.===
'''January 5th 2008''' Super inside sources at [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2008/01/05/MNVKU9L9L.DTL The Chronicle] have revealed that the brothers made a pact with each other in the Ambulance as they were bleeding all over the fucking place.  This pact:  [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]]. Howevar, police have seized their cell phones and are currently looking for pix of the incident.

{{quote|Don't tell them what we did.|Kulbir Dhaliwal to his brother, pwnt by a paramedic.}}

== [[911|911 Transcripts]] ==
The first radio entry was at 5:08 p.m.: 

'''"A VERY AGGITATED [sic] MALE IS CLAIMING HE WAS BITTEN BY AN ANIMAL. … MALE IS [[headshot|BLEEDING FROM THE HEAD]]."''' 

As the zoo was evacuated: 

'''"ZOO PERSONNEL ARE GOING AROUND TO ADV PEOPLE TO LEAVE"''' 

Rescue squads were initially hesitant to enter the grounds until [[Tatiana]] was located:

'''"MEDICS ARE OUTSIDE WILL NOT ENTER TILL SECURE,"'''. 

At one point, the zookeepers may have believed the danger to the victims had passed: 

'''"ZOO PERSONNEL HAVE THE TIGER IN SIGHT AND ARE DEALING WITH IT. THE VICT IS ACROSS THE ZOO INSIDE A CAFÉ,"'''. 

But a few minutes later, Tatiana tracked the brothers to the snack bar while officers radioed: 

'''"SCENE IS NOT SAFE" and "SCENE IS NOT SECURE"''' 

At 5:27 p.m., police witnessed Tatiana attacking [[desi|Paul Dhaliwal]]: 

'''"CODE 33. HAVE TIGER ON FOOT ATTACKING VICTIM"''' 

(As opposed to "tiger in vehicle attacking victim")
But one minute later, they transmitted the message: 

'''"SHOT THE TIGER AT THE CAFÉ VICT BEING ATTENDED TO." 

Tatiana was dead. Radio reports that up to '''[[ZOMG|four additional tigers]]''' were roaming zoo grounds proved false.

Zoo emergency dispatch initially reported that there were two males acting [[retarded|'''800''' (police code for mentally disturbed)]] and making shit up. An empty bottle of vodka found in the car of the [[pwnt|fresh meat]] may or may not explain some of this.

== Christmas is for Tigers ==
The classy Dhaliwal brothers told Sousa Sr. that his son wasn't with them. IRL, these smart aspiring hip hop artists were at the San Francisco Zoo about to become Mexican dinner with a side of Indian food, for a 350-pound Siberian tiger.

{{quote|I said, 'Have you seen my son?' and he said, 'No,' then he wished me a merry Christmas|Sousa Sr. Not hearing his son laughing his ass off; and Dhaliwhali being [[Awesome|racist]], because he should know better. [[Some_argue|Everyone knows]] that Mexicans don't celebrate Christmas, they celebrate Borderjumpica.}}

'''December 30th 2007: ''' <s>Harold and Kumar</s> Paul and Kulbir have been going around the media proclaiming they have called Sousa Sr. to apologize for his kid being pwnt.  Apparently It was some other Sousa Sr. they were calling as the father says he has not heard shit:

{{quote|They have not called me. Last time I talked to them is when they told me my son wasn't with them, and the next day I found out my son was dead, and that makes me a ''little angry but there's nothing I can do''."|Sousa Sr. BAAAAAWWWWWWWWWING and helpless against two kids.}}

== OH LAWD...A Bloody Shoe! ==
Rumors have it that a bloody shoe was found in the grotto of the Tiger's place.  Speculation has arisen that one of these angelic children jumped ass over the fence and was teasing this tiger with one of his legs. Since the tiger had mauled the shit out of a zookeeper's arm the year before, this may have been what experts call a "bad fucking idea." Other theories involve [[O.J. Simpson]], no stranger to bloody accessories.

== fukk you tatiana ==

{{quote| niGGA iMMA MiSS yoU..  iLl sEE yoU SOON CARLOS! |Kayana, heading to the San Francisco Zoo}}

==A History of Violence==
According to a December 30th Article from the [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/30/MNNQU63KP.DTL&hw=zoo+koala+kidnapping&sn=001&sc=1000|SF SF Chronicle], the zoo has also had past incidents involving safety and security lapses. 
These incidents included a koala kidnapping, an [[furry|intruder]] breaking in and having sex with a sheep, an elephant doing a headstand on a trainer, breaking her pelvis, and Tatiana the Tiger mauling the fuck out of the arm of a zoo keeper attempting to feed her a year earlier.

==But what about the poor KITTY??==
[[Image:Page_Image.jpg|thumb|Delicious Cake.]]
Sure, it's always sad when an animal has to die because some dumbfuck decides it's time to send in that [[Darwin Awards]] entry, but most people understand that shit happens. Furries and furries-in-denial wept [[butthurt|bitter tears]] over the incident, however, lamenting the cops' decision to shoot Tatiana instead of appeasing her with offerings of bellyrubs and catnip, as is standard procedure when dealing with gigantic man-eating animals. 

*[http://community.livejournal.com/cat_lovers/4046761.html By no means would I try to downplay the death of a person, but how much sense does it make to destroy an animal that's endangered rather than say, release her to the wild or something :(]
*[http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/347435.html?thread=30478635#t30478635 Why kill it (and endangered species)? Shoot it full of tranquilizers and send it into the wild. If it can't survive, then at least you gave it a chance.] Forget the fact in on many cases the tranquilizers actually kill the animal.
*[http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/347435.html?thread=30494763#t30494763 It obviously has the instinct to kill things and eat the flesh of things.]

Never mind that the tiger was born and raised in captivity, or that killing a human being is about the same as being able to tie your shoes on the wilderness-survival scale. She could totally have survived in the wild! Those meanie cops should've waited for her to kill five or six more people so the zookeeper could get there with his dart gun. That way, she could be released in Bumfuck, Siberia in order to starve to death or get shot by some villager who doesn't give a shit about animal rights when there's a ''fucking man-eating tiger'' on the loose, but at least she would've had a ''chance''.

As of June 4, 2008 the San Francisco Medical Examiner determined that Mr. Sousa was HIGH AND DRUNK, yet his family is still going to sue an already understaffed, underfunded organization for what, to prove a point or to bleed a turnip????!!!  If they sue and are victorious, say goodbye to the zoo and then goodbye to all the animals that are in the zoo because they will surely be euthanized.  Way to prove a point, kill more animals because of an ignorant, idiotic act. 

If those assholes didn't ever taunt that tiger in the first place, none of this would have ever happened.  That tiger was housed in that cage for two years and never once tried to escape.  Smart Carlos, smart.  Karma is such a bitch, too bad it came at the cost of the tiger's life, you were just a waste of life waiting to die, whether it be by the hand of a man pulling a trigger or by the paw and jaw of a tiger.  Please, for god's sake, just let the lesson be learned - DON'T FUCK WITH WILDLIFE!!!!!

==[[Indian]] parenting is the reason Carlos Sousa Jr. and [[Tatiana]] are dead!==
Even Craigslist has something to say about the [http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/rnr/522694772.html incident].

{{quote|It is now looking more and more like the 2 Indian brothers at the SF Zoo or at least one of them is responsible for [[luring]] Tatiana out of her enclosure. Yeah, the enclosure wall might have been a little short but considering there were not other instances like this since fucking 1940 I think it stands to reason that Tatiana was [[Troll|provoked]]. Enter the 2 Indian brothers, this is so fucking typical because if you have ever observed Indian parents you have seen the way they let the boys run around like screaming wild animals. You can almost just see them giggling like [[16_year_old_girl|little girls]] as one of them dangled their leg over the edge thinking it was [[I did it for the lulz|funny]] and having total [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|disregard]] for the [[Rules Of The Internet|rules]]. Now their friend is dead because of them and so is a beautiful tiger. I have a friend who is a teacher and she dreads the parent teacher conferences with Indian parents of a male student because she can't tell them anything less than glowing about the kid without the parents getting defensive and confrontational. If you have ever observed Portuguese parents(Sousa is a Portugese name and not a Mexican name) you know that they are very strict on their kids giving them lots of [[BDSM|discipline]] and guidance. The next time you see Indian brat boys running around in restaurants, stores or malls do the world a favor and yell at their kids and then the parents if they say a word.|Anonymous Craigslist Racist}}


{{quote|I agree with your statement on Carlos Sousa Jr. The Dhaliwal scumbags hung him out to dry. Their Jew could have spoken on their behalf. I wonder what else they're [[Holocaust|guilty of]]. I hope on top of that suit, they're deported to India to be eaten alive by a tiger([[Final solution|I support deportation of all sociopathic criminals]]). Why waste taxpayer money to keep them in jail? Our jails are already black person.|Craigslist Racist #2 [http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/rnr/524468276.html Agrees]}}


{{quote|The biggest lesson to learn? NO ONE like smug minorities or thugs. Really love seeing that the majority of people are rational and logical thinkers and see these chumps for what they really are. Their lives where not worth saving at the expense of the tiger. So sick of the coddling of entitled thugs and assholes. These are two criminals covering their asses and I hope they get what they deserve.|Craigslist Racist #3 [http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/rnr/527108060.html Jumps on the band wagon]}}


==[[NO U|In Defense Of The Dahliwal Brothers]]==
Actually, these two kids have no defense other than [[aspie|temporary insanity]], and that can only be accomplished if their <s>attorney</s> Jew can find a judge retarded, gullible, and/or bribable enough to accept the [[voodoo|"Little Black Sambo"]] defense - they were attempting to perform an ancient [[desi|Afro-Hindu]] manhood ritual involving young Hindu males tricking tigers to run around a tree in circles until they turn into butter, then stuff themselves with pancakes until they're fat, dumb and happy little pickaninnies. While this defense would probably work quite well in the [[redneck|Deep South]], it doesn't stand [[kill it with fire|a snowball's chance in Hell]] as the case's current jurisdiction is in [[Fag|San Francisco]] California.


===Possible Græt Justice===

Police have already reported that the Dhaliwal brothers have been hostile to them in the death investigation. After the attack the brothers refused to give their own names, identify the victim or initially give authorities an account of what occurred.

Whilst currently on the offensive with a fancy [[O.J. Simpson|'celebrity']] Jew, they'll prolly be needing a [[poor|public defender]] when all the [[facts]] come out and witnesses come forward. In the end Marc Geragos will drop their case quicker than [[Britney Spears|Britney Spears']] lawyers.

'''Some Possible Charges''':

*[[pedobear|Contributing to the delinquency of a minor]].
*Involuntary manslaughter.
*Negligent homicide.
*Wrongful death.
*[[furry|Molesting wildlife]].
*Violation of probation.
*Culpable negligence.
*[[bestiality|Animal abuse to an extinct animal.]]
*Trespassing.
*Malicious and criminal mischief.
*Reckless endangerment.
*[[Conspiracy]].
*Possession of a deadly weapon.
*Public endangerment.
*Disorderly conduct.
*Perjury (prediction for 2008).
*Contempt of court (prediction for 2008).
*Tampering with evidence (prediction for 2008).
