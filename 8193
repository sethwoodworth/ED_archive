<blockquote>Now, this is a story all about how<br>
My life got flipped-turned upside down<br>
And I liked to take a minute<br>
Just sit right there<br>
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air<br>
<br>
In west Philadelphia born and raised<br>
On the playground was where I spent most of my days<br>
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br>
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school<br>
When a couple of guys<br>
Who were up to no good<br>
Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br>
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br>
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'<br>
<br>
I begged and pleaded with her day after day<br>
But she packed my suite case and send me on my way<br>
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.<br>
I put my walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.<br>
<br>
First class, yo this is bad<br>
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.<br>
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?<br>
Hmmmmm this might be alright.<br>
<br>
But wait I hear they're prissy, wine all that<br>
Is Bel-Air the type of place they send this cool cat?<br>
I don't think so<br>
I'll see when I get there<br>
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air<br>
<br>
Well, the plane landed and when I came out<br>
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out<br>
I ain't trying to get arrested<br>
I just got here<br>
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared<br>
<br>
I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br>
The license plate said 'FRESH' and it had dice in the mirror<br>
If anything I can say this cab is rare<br>
But I thought 'Now forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'<br>
<br>
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br>
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'<br>
I looked at my kingdom<br>
I was finally there<br>
To settle my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
