Het
{{pixplz}}
A disgusting subgenre of [[Fanfic|Fan fiction]] which pretends that "[[heterosexual]] behaviour" is normal, when everyone knows that [[breeders]] are only slightly less perverted than [[furries]]. [[Some argue]] that about 0.1% of all fanfiction is het. 

==History==

Het fiction, which usually consists in pairing off two otherwise [[Lie|perfectly normal]] [[Faggot|homosexual]] characters together has been completely wiped out of most fanfiction archives, due to its inherent heresy and offensiveness. [[LOL|Writers]] throughout the internet have been up in arms against the public archiving of stories presenting such deviant, hell-bound practices. Rumor has it that some of those characters (a male and a female) sometimes even did NOT engage in [[anal sex]]. But this is difficult to prove since het fanfiction has all but disappeared from the surface of the [[internet|Earth]] since [[J.K. Rowling]] outed [[Dumbledore]] as [[gay|a normal human being]]. 

==Het Nowadays==

A revival of het has been attempted by ''[[Twilight]]'' author [[fanfiction|Stephenie Meyer]], but obviously, it failed. Even Stephen King recognized that slash was superior to the weird [[paraphilia]] that is heterosexuality and that ''Twilight'' failed for that reason. Closely related to that is the tendency of [[16-year-old girls|het writers]] to write under the symptoms of the grave disease of [[Mary Sue]]ism, just like [[Twilight|Stephenie Meyer]]. The results of that disease is the impossibility for the writers to pretend they are a man in order to [[sex|insert themselves]] in the fiction while still maintaining a normal healthy homosexual relationship between the characters. Instead, victims of Het Marysueism turn the main male characters into a breeding pervert so that he can fall in love with her new shiny original and lovable female character (herself). In order to avoid censorship and retaliation, het sex writers often put disclaimers before their story, to warn people of weak disposition of the horror of what they're going to find. A bit like [[pedos|other]] [[Nifty.org|controversial writers]]. 

==Controversy and Criticism==

However, it should be noted that [[Noone|some people]] think that het is a perfectly fine subgenre of fanfiction. Of course, they are wrong and are generally furries who try to take revenge for [[fursecution]] by trying to unleash the next worst thing: heterosexuality. It has [[fail|almost worked]]. 

==Sample usage==

:''"Hary was, like, totally in love with gynni he delictly brushd Ginnys hair n lind towrda her face he kissed her and then he kissd her [[vagina|agina]]. And agina. then he, like, taked her hand n, like, putted it in his----"'' //'''censored''' for the readers [[faggotry|sensibility]] and [[paraphilia|innocence]]. //

Typical reaction:
:''omg!! gross het ;_;''!!!
