Y! Japanese Anime

<br>
'''Japanese Anime''' are a series of chat rooms on [[Yahoo|Yahoo!'s]] [[chat|chat]] client, though the most visited are [[Rules_1_&_2|rooms 1 & 2]]. Though created for the use of [[anime]] discussions, rarely is it actually used for [[Weeaboo|such]]. Its population for the most part consists of [[Troll|trolls]], [[HACKERS_ON_STEROIDS|script kiddies]], [[Newb|n00bs]], [[Fanfiction|fanfiction]] writers, [[Fanboy|fanboys]], and [[you]]. Because it is such a diverse place, trolls commonly take advantage and touch on issues such as black person, [[Unrealistic_Expectations|gay rights]], [[lolwut|political correctness]], [[12_year_old_girls|abortion]], [[Buttsex]], and [[Nazis|religion]], many of which are widely viewed as controversial. While users spend a great deal of time there, [[Shit_Nobody_Cares_About|the chat rooms tend to involve mainly "he said, she said" drama-related issues and Internet dating.]]
[[Image:Failure_at_life.jpg|thumb|right|Typical Japanese Anime user.]] A major fad in Japanese Anime is online [[Role-playing|role-playing]]. [[Weeaboo|Roleplayers]] making up a larger, dominant percentage of JA's [[community]]. As if they couldn't get any [[geek|geekier]] or [[retarded]], they choose infamous characters from foreign shit like [[Naruto]], [[Bleach]], [[Pirate|One Piece]], and [[Death Note]], then toss those characters into the [[Internet_Hate_Machine]] and act things out according to [[sick_fuck|disgusting]], [[Faggot|gay]] and  [[Trap|gender-bending]] themes. Speaking out against their sexual deviance will you get you called a [[troll]] and placed on [[defriend|ignore]]. The [[weeaboo|weeaboos]] of Japanese Anime place little stock in [[common sense]], hence the spending of endless hours typing the gayest narratives ever spouted in chat ('''e.g., "-huggles-" and "-nibbles on pockey- oo;"'''). The more [[Sick_Fuck|sick]] and [[Furry|twisted]] of a person you are, the more welcome you will feel. Believe it or not, they'll welcome a [[pedophile]] before a [[troll]], so long as he/she has an anime character and a bizarre font blend. [[Image:Narutotyp.gif|thumb|right|blood_limit_uchiha_sasuke: Hehe. >:D Stupid Zaft. Chatrooms aren't the [[In_the_ass|only thing I troll!]]]]

'''Note:''' this is proven fact.

As if it couldn't get any worse, there exist RP groups such as "[[Gorillaz|Murder Inc.]]", an elite group of text-fighters that diddle each other when they aren't bragging about owning one another or other online clans. To sum Japanese Anime up, it's a cesspool where anything and everything undesirable is fair game, so long as its users are allowed to live in their mass delusion of make-believe.


== Japanese Anime Internetz Clubhouse ==

When not being completely [[fucktard|cool]] in [[basement dweller|Yahoo! Chat]], members enjoy getting together on their own [[Kawaii|cute]] little forum full of much [[retard|intelligence]] and [[fail|win]], complete with pictures, real names for some, and even a nice description for each one. [[Roleplayers]], [[furries]], and [[faggots]], oh my!

http://orochi.com/curlp/

Have fun trolling.

== Extra credit trolling ==
It's come to ED's attention that a major part of Japanese Anime:2's roleplayers have moved onto a [[AIDS|better]] place to live out their [[lolwut|eLives]].

http://rphaven.com/

Not only is if full of yaoi fags, but also futas, shitting dick nipples, and [[ronery|pedobears]].

From rumor, this site might give you a virus.

== The "Males" of Japanese Anime ==

[[Anal]]y[[incest|sis]]: Any moral person of [[Tranny|either gender]] would be disgusted and saddened by Yahoo!'s feeble excuse for men. While they act [[Internet_tough_guy|masculine]], they're as [[Faggot|insecure]] as the women they embarrassingly hound.
The types of males you'll find in Japanese Anime are:

* [[Nerd_Rage|The angsty loner]] who, under a weeaboo screen name, involves himself in Internet drama, carries knives IRL, has a shallow, bitchy complex, supports [[gay]] [[fandom]]s and reads [[crap|manga]] in his spare time.
* [[Unwarranted_self-importance|Egoistical]] morons who [[lie]] about having a life or [[shit_nobody_cares_about|being enlisted in the army]], whilst believing underage, nerdy girls like are impressed. They tend to use emoticons and are heavily under the influence of [[Jenkem]]. Yes, Casey and ShaneLee. This was written just for you two.

* Typical fanboy males who shamelessly admits their flaws instead of living behind a false ego. Generally use text-faces and excessive [[XD]], and also roleplays.

* Shamelessly or closet-ly [[gay]]. And despite being the [[cancer]] that is killing Y! chats, care only for themselves and what [[AIDS|STDs]] they can find or trade. In other words, they're sick fucks.

*[[Fucktards]] who claim to design [[shit|webpages]], [[Goatse|work through the internet]], or claim to do anything believed to be interesting in [[lie|general]] (or they do, and just [[fail|suck at it]]).

*[[Trap|Are You Really A Boy]] males.  These males consist of rabid [[fangirls]] who are so wrapped into their dillusions that they believe that they're male IRL. Typically you can find these girls asing for yaoi and buttsex.  (Ex: [[Whore|hitoshirezu.sora]])

== The "Females" of Japanese Anime ==

[[Anal]]y[[Incest|sis]]: Rabid [[16-year-old girls]] who plan to never leave the Internet and breed, ultimately causing the Earth's population to die off due to their addicting to text and longing to be loved by that [[13-year-old boy]].
The types of females you'll find in Japanese Anime are:

[[Image:AnimeGirl_Suicide.jpg|thumb|right|Is that Liz?]]

* Bitchy, whiney, shallow, and send mass messages involving drama or about how they're [[An_hero|leaving Y! FOREVER!!111111]]

* Unattractive, thus involves herself in [[cybersex]] to make up for what she will never get [[IRL]]. Alternatively, they write [[Megaman|fanfictions]].

* Attractive, though lacking personality, thus tends to start endless amounts of [[Internet drama]] for the sake of getting that 13-year-old boy back, later losing him to the next floozie -- or worse, her [[BFF]].

* Really a [[basement-dweller|basement-dwelling]] male out to diddle anime fanboys, or trolls out to make Y!'s male gender feel more insignificant for epic [[lulz]].



== E-Drama Llamas ==

Not everyone in JA is a Troll. For instance you have the noobs, and the oh-so-famous [[Drama|Drama Whores]]. These consist of those few people who sometimes speak of their IRL issues. Or, even more likely to happen, they speak about their "he said she said" water-works of doom.  A few of the most well known members of the JA rooms are known simply for their dramatics. Some of these pathetic little cunts also beg to be put on this page. Lulz ensues, however, and they always assume it's their e-exes or ex-bffs. Note: How many of you added yourselves? Shame, shame.

===Brandi===
(SN: [[Weeaboo|hitoshirezu.sora]], [[Emo|abandoning.my_dreams]]) The self-proclaimed [[lesbian]]. Known to be dating some [[Fat|girl]] named [[Retard|Chelsea]] for 6 years, and yet still dating [[Hurr|Jessie]], [[the|Jurgen]], [[Game|Kacy]], [[Dyke|Lolli]], [[wat|Radzemierez]], and a few others.  Does this make her a [[whore|whore]]? Of course it does! She is known for being so immense, that she has her own gravitational pull. She keeps items in orbit for easy reach. Such as [[Jizztini|Milk]], [[fat|cupcakes]] and [[dicks|hot dogs]]. Brandi is known for her running around as Sora, and [[fail|keyblade raping]] people. Not only that, but she also has [[an hero|suicidal tendancies]]. It's best just to avoid her. Also noted is that she has an unhealthy obsession with the word "Hitoshirezu".  ((If you figure out the joke here, you get [[Internet Money|The Interwebz]].)) Missing in action for how long now?  Does anyone know where this whore went?  Sources say she refuses to make a comeback, citing that she 'has a real life' now and doesn't care about the internet. We all know this is a lie.  Come back, Brandi, come back. We don't miss your fail!get ass at all.  Recently discovered: She's still fat. She's still living with her grandfather.  She's still hounding after that Chelsea chick. (wtf bitch, it's been 8 years. If you're not married by now, it ain't gonna happen.) She also claims to have a new screenname that no-fag knows.  Prove her wrong and donate it to the ED.  LATEST NEWS: Someone pinch me, I must be dreaming. That [[fat|fat]] bitch actually managed to get someone? According to sources, Brandi scored herself some Native American [[faggot|jackass]] who's all for her. Do we believe this? Hell no! She's still probably chasing after that Chelsea chick.  Sources have, however, also verified that she has a kitten named [[fail|Lelouch vi Britannia]].  How much more [[weeaboo]] can she get? GET A LIFE YOU [[Retard|LARDASS!]]

===Fai===
The loser who CLAIMS to have created these articles. She told Lolli and a few token others that she made the entire page and claims credit to all of it. She wins the [[internet_money|interwebs]] for sure. In reality, Fai is just an acne ridden loser who thinks for some reason that she is a [[Maury|relationship specialist]]. She believes she has the gall to call people whores and losers when she cannot even accept the fact that she herself has never dated anyone in her life (gee, we wonder why) nor has she ever been accepted into society as a functioning, mature adult, like most [[internet_disease|worms]] who corrupt Yahoo! Chat.  Update for the Masses: Currently she's been spotted on rph.com like all the other [[Weeaboo]]s.  She also renounced her claim to owning these articles as she's aware who the real 'creator' is. Drama seems to be Fai's middle name as you can't go anywhere without someone complaining. AKA Courtney.  It's not just Courtney and Fai. No, they've become merged. They're now: [[fail|Fart]]. Rumor has it that she's gotten herself a real man, as well. Of course, we all know what a 'real man' is.  A [[faggot|fat]], [[Lolli|mexican]], [[whore|gas station worker]].

===Courtney===	
How many [[Fail|bitches]] has this [[Whore|whore]] dated?  How many more times can she pull the [[shit_nobody_cares_about"|I'm dying. Pity me."]] card before someone smart realizes she's a fag?  Rumor has it that she broke it off with her last lover because she's too psycho.  Or maybe it was her lover that ditched her because she's the psycho.  Either way, Courtney is known for having her hands in all sorts of nasty places. Including between [[AIDS|Silky's nasty thighs]].  It doesn't get much worse than that.  Recent reports state that she's given up the [[Whore|dating]] thing (again) and that she's going to focus on [[Internet|real life]].  There is no such proof that real life even exhists for this bitch, so why make false statements?  She claims to have stopped [[Lulz|RPing]] as well, although we all know this is just to try and throw people off her [[Cancer|foul scent]].  Nothing is to be believed about this girl. In fact, you shouldn't even believe that her name is Courtney. For all we know she could be some [[13_year_old_boy|pedophile]] that rapes little boys in his/her/it's basement.  A more recent rumor is that she's dating [[Fail|Brandi]].  A match made in Heaven.  Two whores and e-drama.  [[Vomit|Enjoy]]. With recent findings of Brandi supposedly engaged, we're left to wonder what happened to Courtney.  We'ren't those two fags dating?  Not that Courtney could be dating anyone ever. She's nothing but a fat blob. Sources have told us that she becomes more related to a 'pile of shit' than she has been previously.  Maybe she'll even turn green and grow corn one day.

===Fallyn===	
A young Irish lad who migrated from shitland with her abusive alcoholic father to California. A highschool drop out who does nothing but bitch and lurk on the internet because she has nothing else going of her. Living off her room mate whom she turned gay by constantly riding his cock with her hamburger helper STD infected vagina. Her only job is to hunt for cock on the internet and create drama to make up for her lack of life. Fallyn, a cock sucking leech took her own virginity with a toy giraffe claiming it to be an "accident". She will constantly be seen spamming chat about pointless shit, thinking that anyone is paying interest and attention to her. Little does she know everyone tends to tune her out. This bitch also feels the need to tell everyone how disgusting her bowel movement is, and when it happens in hopes that some men with scat fetishes will help her star in the next 2girls1cup video and she will be forever popular on the internet. If you call her out on being a slut or simply a subhuman she will claim you are "tsundere" for her, it helps her cope with the fact that no one is able to tolerate a walking, talking, breathing shitblob. 

===Leanna===
[[bullshit|Self-proclaimed lesbian.]] [[At_least_100_years_ago|For four-six years]], this lolcow yaoi roleplayer has been cursing the cancer that is Yahoo chat with her shitty fandoms, ALLCAPS spamming, smutty fanart and irl problems. As well as being in chat for four-six years, supposedly, Lea has had bulimia for this amount of time (shouldn`t she either be 70 lbs. or dead?), manic depression and extreme paranoia. She has also, during that amount of time, said that she would get a [[nice_try|paper route job]] / already has one. We know you're all laughing by now, reading this, but if any of those facts aren`t enough to entertain you, get this: what adds to her psycho ass problems is the fact that she tries to go around saying she's asexual/does not get horny, but she cybers fucking everyone. Her ex [[Lolcow|lolcow]] girlfriend, Jessie/Jesse/Transvestite/Hairy bitch is most notoriously known for telling Lea to [[Anhero|kill herself]] after they broke up. Everyone adores Leanna. Nobody talks shit about her. It`s okay Lea! We are all behind you supporting you!

===Lolli===
If you know of Lolli, you know she's just as confusing as what her nickname is actually pronounced as. Is is "Lawl-lee" like a lollipop (which has it's own wonderful chocolate filled double-entendre), or if it's "Lool-lee". Needless to say, no matter which way you choose to say it, the name Lolli is special. God forbid that someone makes the same character from an anime. Face it, Lolli. There are going to be copies. She's also known for getting so upset that she'll threaten to leave, or even go further as to delete names just because she isn't [[One|The Only One]]. Also, She loves to fuck with people, and GOD FORBID [[Faggot|Steven]] is ignoring her, this cunt will go out and find a toy, until her beloved prick returns. Well known fact: Lolli has no life other than to threaten suicide and haet whenever she doesn't get what she wants. Case and point, Steven is still fat.  Poor anorexic mexican can't have a fatass boyfriend or she'll become her favorite brand of tortilla.

===Meagan aka Hunter aka Bella===
If you know her, you probably know she has five million different Hetalia names. She thinks that she's half Asian, but reports have confirmed she's delusional. She also claims to be a model and work in a [[Nice Try|"classy" sex shop]]. She is known widely for starting e-drama when she can't get the cyber buddy she wants, or someone is invading on her e-man (all twenty of them). Some may know she is Vash's fiance and DanDan's girlfriend. It doesn't matter though, since they're both probably lies and both are most likely her on other SNs. Don't piss her off, or she'll have her friends attack you.

Don't forget this bitch is psychotic to the tenth degree. That's what most likely causes said moments of psychosis.  She told [[Fag|Bryan/Kevin]] that if he dumped her, she would destroy his stuff and key his car. He was supposed to visit her, and she'd wait for him and drive to the bus stations and get herself into a panic.  And he'd always have an awesome excuse. He was forced into being her 'fiance'. She said she would [[Emo|cut herself]] if Eli stopped liking her. And lest we forget [[Baby|Piper]], her darling little daughter who got taken away by her mom because Meagan failed as a mother. GG, Meagan. GG.

She's also started to run around declaring that she has micro tumors in her ovaries and is getting chemo for them, but this, of course, is another one of her 'attention getters'.

===[[Dyke|Hetalia House]]===

[[Hetalia|we_stand_on_guard_for_thee]] Unwarranted self importance right here.

If you know her, you know that she likes Gelato and has a nickname. That is about it. However, this crazy bitch loves to LARP (Live-action Roleplay). Apparently, because she likes Gelato and prefers to be called by her nickname. Recently she was involved in drama involving kiss_my_iron_cross_prussia and a 16-year-old who thinks she is France. She broke up with Prussia for the France. But according to her, she is someone who has [[nice_try|never done anything to anyone]], but, for some reason, still gets harassed by people who do not even know her. [[Fail|Classy]]. Some people just need to take a step back, look at themselves and literally fuck their own faces.

===Silky===
Have you ever met someone online, and thought that they were the coolest thing in the world.  Only to find out that IRL they're nothing more than a spoiled child?  This is Silky in a nutshell.  When she's not whining about not being able to find role-play, she's busy getting into pointless arguments. Silky used to be famous for being Don's boyfriend. (Did we mention that Silky is female?) She continued to lie and lie about her gender at the pace that she ate cupcakes, but two brave EDiots, Denise and TJ tugged this [[fatty|lying whore]] out of the [[tranny|closet]]. Now she's making a name of herself by playing Angel's Online. But the drama couldn't just stay confined to yahoo. Not for Silky. If drama doesn't happen, she isn't happy. This girl is the ultimate definition of the word [[money|spoiled]]. Count yourself lucky if you've never met her. And if you do know her, and managed to stay friends with her, then you should be given props for your [[fail|willpower]] and [[stupid|stupidity]]. This whore is excessively nasty, at one point in her [[emo|life]] she had a [[gaping_vagina_the_size_of_a_hallway|hole]] in her leg that she wanted people to [[Sick_fuck|fuck]], and she pulled a live, wiggling maggot out of her ear.

===[[Fat|Stalker-chan]]===

[[Hetalia|kieven_to_russia]] 
[[Hetalia|norwegienviking]]
[[Hetalia|oldromachan]]

That's right kids, there's a new one in town. It's Stalker-chan/Pedobear (Stephanie) and he's on the lookout for you. Whether it be Sealand or some other Hetalia faggot shitting screen name, he's coming for you, and he's coming fast. Stalker-chan is not to be taken lightly. He is the pedophile of Yahoo and is so addicted to sex that it is leaking out of every orifice in his body. Some people call this Stalker-chan Deichan, others call him a dyke. Either way, Stalker-chan is lurking, boys and girls of Hetalia! He'll IM you over and over for RP hoping to get laid and will come between couples just for teh s3xx0rz. Make sure to avoid this person at all costs--it seems he likes to change identities often! Be on the look out!

===Steven===
This fat fuck (he weighs almost four hundred pounds) thinks he's emo. He saunters around the chatrooms on Yah!Fag with Lolli, his self-proclaimed Mexican lover. It's almost moot that he's so obsessed with [[Tranny|Courtney]]. [[Fatass|Fai]], and a few other younger girls. We think he's a pedophile, but since his four-inch penis has no length or width enough to even sustain bloodflow, we simply AREN'T SURE. Is this douchefag even still alive?  Shouldn't he be dead in a pile of his own feces and vomit? Congratulations, if you're still alive, Steven.  The mexican chick still owns you and your rights to live.

===TJ===
Currently, he's dating a four-hundred pound chick that lives five minutes away from Columbus, Ohio, named "Nova."

Gamertag: CallofCthulu.

If you know this loser, you also know that despite having countless [[Resident Evil]] screen names and Guilty Gear (mostly Bridget) identities, he has also told the majority of Yahoo! user rooms that he is a [[lies|25-year-old male who lives in Columbus, Ohio]]. His real name is Timothy, and he's obsessed with furry porn, shota, and yaoi. He further ruins his e-reputation by getting on voice and "trolling" people. This kid's real age, given by a loyal EDiot, is actually 16, making him a bona-fide basement dweller. He is currently dating [[Fat|Courtney]] in real life. They live twenty minutes from one another and have sex all the time. "It was like fucking a baby" was his only defense, when Steven beforehand had commented that fucking her was "like throwing a hotdog down a hallway." 

While Courtney and TJ are exclusive Yahooligan whorebags who roleplay everything under the sun just for 'teh secks', they both specialize in making children cry. He met [[Fat_Bitches|GB]] in a span of two days and dated her for three months. 

TJ attends regular [[Furry]] chatrooms, contributes requests for artwork on Deviantart, and masturbates to it. He also admitted to writing the Silky section of this page. For some reason he believes that he's a bisexual troll. In fact, he probably cheats on Courtney and numerous other girls (and guys) that he interacts with on MSN, Yahoo!, and the other [[shit_nobody_cares_about|chatrooms]] speckled like chickenpox all over the interfuck.

Mike, Zaft, and a few other trolls who occupy Japanese Anime:1 say that TJ is simply a Zaft-wannabe, and jacks off so much that there is hair growing from his hands.

{{quote|I love furries. My ipod is full of furry porn. I make art requests on DeviantArt for like, 20 bucks. lulz. But I don't understand why the hell the rest of the furries embarass us normal ones. They ask for sex all the time.|TJ}}

Hypocrite. Everyone on Yahoo! knows him for dating everybody he can and asking for sex on all of his furry profiles.

He is also known as the now raped ed user "[[user:DurpDeeHurp|DurpDeeHurp]]" was banned for trying to sanitize this article, and descended upon [[ed:irc]] to try to get himself unbanned. He claimed among other things that he wrote this portion of the page about himself in an effort to get not only unbanned but to get this portion of the page removed which obviously didn't happen.

{{quote|I tried to remove my part from the page without saying shit. I wasn't thinking. I should have said something. This is what [[fat|3 ham sandwiches]] and 2 days without sleep does."|TJ}}

===The Cunt Clique Group===
A group of [[Whore|girls]] who think they have a copyright own of the JA rooms. They consist of Katie, her lesbian girlfriends, and many more [[Whore|girls]] who fight over who the spotlight is on in the room. If someone starts to get more attention than another, then they are out of the group due to jealousy. [[Attention_whore|The Cunt Clique]] will then make that person exiled and [[No_one_likes_you|hated]] by speaking [[Lies|slander]] about them and the information they know on that person's [[404|life]]. [[Image:liz_ja.jpg|thumb|right|Image on Liz's profile: fame_over_love. She needs to be saved from herself because she's over 400 pounds, and cannot stop eating.]]

With this danger, you'd think that the JA [[Girls|cunts]] would be smarter than to give their IRL names, phone numbers, and addresses out in the chat room, but of course they are too [[Special_Ed|stupid]] to realize that the internet has [[4chan|hackers on steroids]], waiting to post their phone numbers and pictures on [[Craigslist|3rd party sites]]. But, [[Attention_whore|The Cunt Clique]] doesn't care. It gives them something more to whine and complain about in the JA rooms for [[Ego|attention]]. 

They are ALL [[Loser|drop-outs]] of high school, due to the fact that they spend a majority of their days and nights in these rooms. Hell, they spend every living-fucking-ass-picking hour of their days in there.

If they are not talking about how "hot" [[Ugly|Mike]] and [[Boring|Max]] are, and fighting over who the 'boys' like more, then they are making fun of the [[Role-playing|role players]] for being [[Creative|immature]]. 

In [[Irl|reality]] though, the [[Attention_whore|The Cunt Clique]] are nothing more than [[Pig|girls]] who get picked on IRL, have no future or job, and resort to making "names" for themselves on the internet just so they can feel a little bit [[Internet_celebrity|"important"]].

WARNING! [[Attention_whore|The Cunt Clique]] is attempting to edit this page to save Stephen from "being flamed". The truth is, they're just trying to score with him so they can suck his dick. 

A wanna be Cunt Clique member known by the name Karin has been trying to vandalize this article. Her lack of braincells are unable to rationalize that it is the E.D mods who keep deleting her butt hurt posts. In order to get attention from anyone and I mean from ANYONE this poor sap of a girl is willing to do all she can. Like talk to herself in a chat in order to seem popular. E-popularity is really a big deal for most of the RPH members. Especially this one who feels the need to hoard every pokemon name she can, because being the best pokemon role player is top tier. She was not only the best pokemon role player she was also a mod for the room. Clearly putting in her an position above Tom Cruise. Not even his grip of death will save him from such an elitist pokemon role player.

== How to Troll in JA ==
[[DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|LISSEN UP, FAGGOTS]], because you're hearing this from [[LIE|THE BEST FUCKING TROLL WHO EVER LIVED]]. You can't go about trolling in Yahoo! illogically anymore. People aren't 11 anymore, they're 14. Which means you have to step it up. Don't attack someone because of their screen name. That leads to countertrolling and fail. This is an example of Mike getting writer's block, and Zach just failing, hard. Really, really hard.

general_tso_tso_00: Projection? I definitely think so.
sadistic.willy_wonka: Because every other little queer simply overpowers the chatroom with text, kind of like you do.  And no matter what I say, no matter what proof I offer to you, you will not respond to it.
sadistic.willy_wonka: You are worse scum than Zaft.
sadistic.willy_wonka: You don't know how to troll properly.
sadistic.willy_wonka: For this, I'm going to have to fucking teach you how someday. 
general_tso_tso_00: 'Because every other little queer' Didn't I just you this? Translation: NO U
general_tso_tso_00: call you^
general_tso_tso_00: 'overpowers the chatroom with text, kind of like you do.' You're the one typing tl;dr's, Mr. Anonymous.
sadistic.willy_wonka: I type in TL;DR's because I don't know how to lower myself to a shorter version.  I speak King's English.
sadistic.willy_wonka: No slang, nothing.
general_tso_tso_00: Someone calls for a serious facepalm. All fingers are pointing at sadistic.willy_wonka.
sadistic.willy_wonka: You tell me that I go to 4chan and ED, and yet you've used more memes than I have in the past two days.
sadistic.willy_wonka:  I'm trying to give you a fair chance in this "trolling" thing you want to do so much and you fail in front of my eyes?
sadistic.willy_wonka: Go on, keep looking up your memes. I'll give you another ten minutes to come up with some smartass comment.
sadistic.willy_wonka: Don't you fucking roleplay at me.  Wave at everyone else in your pathetic dream world.
general_tso_tso_00: Hahaha, I come back to fags trying to engege in yaoi cyber with Willy Wonka.
sadistic.willy_wonka: What an illogical, blatantly untrue thing to say.
sadistic.willy_wonka: Let me ask you, are you retarded?
sadistic.willy_wonka: Nobody here even aimed their faggoty roleplaying at me.
sadistic.willy_wonka: Except that one child who "waved at the whole room".
harboring.objection: I'd rp with Zach 
general_tso_tso_00: 'Except that one child who "waved at the whole room".' Well then... ?
general_tso_tso_00: Zach? The same one they said posed as a girl?
sadistic.willy_wonka: The same one that didn't. 
sadistic.willy_wonka: You're an idiot, Michael.
general_tso_tso_00: Must be the punk that goes around as conference gangbang. I'd expect this kind of gay shit from him, too.
sadistic.willy_wonka: conference.gangbang? No. Try agian, Michael.
sadistic.willy_wonka: He spells his name with a "K" if you remember.
general_tso_tso_00: Who is Michael?
sadistic.willy_wonka: Mike, Michael, whatever the fuck you call yourself. 
sadistic.willy_wonka: Liz called you Mike, I call you Michael.
general_tso_tso_00: I'm neither of those people.
sadistic.willy_wonka: I still defy you to try again. I'm not conference.gangbang.
sadistic.willy_wonka: You should remember me.  Lech, You, Aly, and I used to go to JA:1, you whore. And you don't remember me.
general_tso_tso_00: I don't know a Liz. She's obviously delusional.
general_tso_tso_00: I don't know Aly.
general_tso_tso_00: And Lech is a Naruto fanboy. Why the fuck would you hang out with him?
harboring.objection: I used to be besties with Lech. 
harmonic.mutilation: Typical Spook @ Pandeno.
sadistic.willy_wonka: I don't. I usually made fun of him for being such a fucking retarded Polack.
general_tso_tso_00: Anyways, this place is infested with so many fags that it's making me nauseous.
general_tso_tso_00 left the room
sadistic.willy_wonka: You think you're suffering from nausea?
sadistic.willy_wonka: I've seen and trolled more faggots than you will in the next year.

1:49:25 AM  general_tso_tso_00: Your mental defenses suck.  
1:49:34 AM  general_tso_tso_00: Your offensive game is just as shitty.
1:49:58 AM  sadistic.willy_wonka: > My offensive game is logical, moreso than throwing obscene, irrelevant, untrue bullshit by the way of people.
1:50:13 AM  general_tso_tso_00: It's like punching a tied up retarded kid when I type to sadistic.willy_wonka.
1:50:13 AM  sadistic.willy_wonka: > Notice how I type verbosely? It's natural. It's called not being a fucking moron.

2:03:03 AM  general_tso_tso_00: 'When did I ever get butthurt over you?'   Twelve hours ago, and again now.

2:05:06 AM  rmbryu: not yet mike.
2:05:26 AM  sadistic.willy_wonka: > You deny being Mike and yet here's your friend calling you mike.
2:05:33 AM  general_tso_tso_00: It's so annoying when gays, especially ones with Willy Wonka screen names, whine about "intelligence" and "logic." God only knows what those terms mean to a queer.
2:05:47 AM  sadistic.willy_wonka: > It's so annoying when ignorant niggers don't read all your post.

You don't want to fail, you want to troll, so here are some general guidelines:
*Exploit a weakness: You don't want to attack from nowhere, you want to find a weakness. This could be ignorance, stupidity, age, weight, etc. [[Crysis|Don't run in blind]].
*Reply to everything: If you don't read and reply to every post, and you ignore them like a faggot would, they're not going to give a shit what you say. 
*The person you're trolling submits to you: You have failed in your mission if they begin agreeing with you. There is no way to counter submission.
*Are you intelligent at all?: It would be asinine, idiocy for people of lesser intelligence to do this. (SEE ALSO: [[Verbose Thread]])

== The Article's Impact ==

While few [[Internet_celebrity|trolls]] took it as an ego boost and reflection of their hard work, the losers too stupid to realize it that it was an insult to be on here took it as a jab to theirs. This has resulted in extreme WikiEdit & drama:

** Attention whores adding themselves to the list and going, "OMG, who did I make butthurt to get put on ED? lol."
** Non-trolls adding themselves to feel important and witty.
** Butthurt losers adding non-Japanese Anime trolls or their own unfunny comments.
** Also, it gives certain fucktard Trolls the idea that they own the article, giving themselves the privilege to write about the 'Impact' of an ED article on Y!fags. This is especially true with [[User:Comrade Zatch|Zach]], who really doesn't troll there anymore but feels it fit to watch the page. Vandalize his page. 

Surprisingly, while the article is mainly based on the doings of roleplayers and weeaboos, the trolls got the bigger response.
