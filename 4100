Internets English

The mortal enemy of [[spellcheck]], the various dialects of '''Internets English''', ranging from [[1337]], imspeak, [[lolcat]] (now divorced from chanspeak, I don't care if they are the same; you don't see too much of Kitty Pidgin on *chans now) is a language that has a large amount of speakers, ranging from the [[Anonymous]]  collective, their [[retards|allied forces]] of [[ED]], the [[*chan|*chans]] and various other [[internets| major and minor e-communities]]. The leader of the free world, [[George W. Bush]], is also an [[moron|aficionado]] of Internets English.

Many '''Internets English''' mainstays such as the verb "[[pwn]]" (a derivative of "[[own]]") are considered to be bona fide [[typo]]s that, having entered the [[Internet Hate Machine]], were not only accepted into the [[lulz|lexicon]] but aggressively adopted for [[great justice|everyday use]]. Though there is a different between 1337 and words like 'Pwn' and chanspeak, many internet dialects of English are [[clusterfuck|spoken together]].

In chanspeak, for example it is now an accepted option, nay [[DO IT FAGGOT|OBLIGATORY]] that '''"the"''' be spelled '''"teh"''', '''"[[cake]]"''' becomes '''"caek"''', '''"[[hate]]"''', '''"haet"''' and '''"[[like]]"''', '''"[[mudkips|liek]]"'''*.

<small>*Many speakers also claim that you "[[fail it]]" if you spell '''like''', '''leik''' or '''hate''', '''hat'''.</small> 

Large quantities of the internet dialects spoken, for example  "[[plox]]" ("please") and phrases like and "[[LOL WUT]]" (as in: "excuse me, what did you say?") are not well known in the "[[IRL|real world]]", make [[NORP|ordinary people]] think you're a [[/b/tard|retard]] when used in [[IRL|real world]] situations. 

For example, going into your local bank and passing your teller a note that says '''"PLOX 2 BE GIVE ME MOAR JEW GOLD (or [[Lioncash]]) OR IRL [[B&]]"''' will unlikely get you a bag of crisp $100 bills much less a '''"[[NO U]]!"'''

The third category are Internets English words and phrases that have come to us from [[Japan]]ese [[video games|culture]], either in their [[crack|original]] form (see [[Desu]] and [[Kawaii]]) or via [[Engrish]] translation (see [[All Your Base Are Belong To Us]] and are much beloved by large portions of the [[Weeb]].

Examples include, "[[DESU]]", "[[NO U]]!", "[[DO NOT WANT]]! and "that's totally [[kawaii]]!"

Other times, this '''raep''' of the [[English|Queen's English]] is deliberate, such as with the seemingly endless stream of 'cute' [[Caturday|animal macros]] coming from [[loser|lame]] [[NORP]] sites like [[lolcat]], where the oh-so [[unfunny|witty]] [[shoop]]er will tag a variety of animals in lulzy situations with the obligatory hilarious [[IMPACT]] caption suggesting said animal can speak but not spell. Most of these [[fags|wags]] can only [[penis|get it up]] for an '''I HAS A (WHATEVER)''' shoop whilst [[college]] grads will show their parents that the small fortune it cost putting them through [[W|Yale]] was worth every penny by mangling the word '''corn''' into '''corm''', for example. There is a difference between LOLCAT and chanspeak; it became pronounced a while ago.
