A self-troll is when someone inadvertently trolls either themselves or a group they associate themselves with.

An Example:

<pre>
<@fubster> INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY
:: fubster sets mode +b fubster!*@* on channel #ed
:: fubster has been kicked from #ed by fubster (use of phrase information superhighway)
</pre>.
