Notorious British [[nerd]] partially responsible for inventing the [[internet]]. Britain [[pwn]]ed the world by causing him to kill himself.

==Short Life==
He created the world's most advanced code breaking computer and cracked some [[Nazi]] codes including enigma, making him a proto-h4ck3r, and thus helped to win the war and keep Britain out of the Reich. Without him the world might have been saved by [[Hitler]], [[Mussolini]], and [[Stalin]]. 

The British Government thanked him for saving their [[arse]]s by arresting him for being [[gay]]. They forced him to take female hormones because back in those [[fucktard]]ed times they thought that any [[gay]] person was automatically of the opposite sex. 

He wasn't allowed to work with computers anymore even though he was a fucking [[genius]] because the spooks who arrested him were [[batshit crazy]] [[homophobia|homophobes]] (This is one of many reasons why [[England]] fails even more than the [[Spics]]). As he wasn't actually [[transsexual]] this made him intensely [[emo|depressed]]. In the end, he [[Suicide|killed himself]].

==Suicide==

Through his death Alan not only proved himself to be [[an hero]] but also enormously [[gay]]. As he was a huge fan of ''Snow White and The Seven Dwarves'' he killed himself by lacing an apple with cyanide. The world is yet to see a [[gay]]er death than this and probably never will.

A recent article in ''The New Yorker'' has alleged that Turing may not have killed himself, but rather [[pwn|pwned]] by the British intelligence.[http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/articles/060206crbo_books] After Turing was exposed as a catcher and not a pitcher when it came to getting raped in the ass by his big fatass neighbor Paul, it was no longer possible for him to get [[buttsecks]] in the Britain. Thus, he started making frequent trips to [[Europe|Eastern Europe]] in search of buttsecks with [[13-year-old boy|13-year-old boys]]. The British intelligence were worried that Turing was trading state secrets with the [[Communism|commies]] for buttsecks, and may have pwned him as result.

It was rumored that the original rainbow [[Apple]] logo was invented to pay homage to Alan and the apple he killed himself with, but as the "fag flag" wasn't invented until two years later, that would be impossible.

==Intelligent Internets==
Although well known for coining the phrase "hot stuff coming through", Turing also invented the Turing Test in 1950: a method to measure intelligence in computers through a chat-room. If you replace a person with a computer without seeing it happen and can't tell the difference then the computer has intelligence. 

Machines haven't yet passed the Turing Test as demonstrated by the current Governor of California in ''The Terminator''.

Most [[IRC]] users also fail this test; in fact it has [[Research|long been predicted]] that the Turing Test will be passed by a machine as a result of the general human level of sentience [[fail]]ing, rather than that of the machines increasing.

==Epic Win==
On September 10, 2009, the British Prime Minister [http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20571 apologized] for his country being such a dick.
