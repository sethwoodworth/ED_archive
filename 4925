[[Image:Enslave_black_people.jpg|thumb|Logic has a run-in with indoctrination]]
'''Logic''' is an almost mythical and incredibly rare element on the internet, and is the most pathetic and ineffective tool to use against a [[troll]] or anyone you know in general.

== History of Logic ==

Logic was invented by the [[old|ancient Greeks]] in order to make themselves feel useful, because back in the day they were scrawny fucks who weren't capable of murdering people with rocks. However, everyone who isn't a complete [[idiot]] knows that said intellectuals aren't useful, because making decisions based on anger, paranoia, and [[lulz]] is the only sound course of action. Eventually, the creators of logic were all [[raped]] to death by [[nigras]]. Logic was rediscovered by the Ancient Greeks as a useful tool for destroying Troy, inventing [[drama]] and having [[anal sex|sex]] [[NAMBLA|with boys]].

It disappeared during the Alexandrian Conquest and was replaced with swords. This explains Alexander's answer to the Problem of the Knot.

[[Irony|Ironically]], logic resurfaced in the Middle Ages, [[irony|predominantly by Catholic Monks]]. The [[The Pope|Catholic Church]] quickly put this new tool to use, using it to distract [[teh]] ignorant peasants while they butt[[raped]] their [[children]].

The pinnacle of Logic brought us [[computer]]s and the [[Internets]]. These handy tools have allowed complete knobs to declare triumphantly that Logic does not work.

Logic used to be taught at schools until the Jews figured that the world would be easier to conquer if everybody else was stupid. This has led [[Americans]] to become ignorant first-world peasants, driven through their short, insignificant lives solely by a pair of small glands located somewhere just above the kidneys.

==Lolgic==
Different than ordinary Logic. Lolgic is the [[Encyclopedia_Dramatica|ED]] approved form of correct logic, known as "lolgic". It is easy to differentiate between ordinary logic and lolgic as it has the correct amount of lulz.

== Syllo[[Cum|gism]] ==
The likely foregoer of Cow-is-Table Logic (see below) in which two premises are combined to form a conclusion.
:'''''An example of syllogistic reasoning:'''''
"God is love; Love is blind; Therefore, Ray Charles is God."  -Richard Jeni, [[an hero]]

Notice the subtle differences between Syllo[[Cum|gism]] and Lolgic. Any [[moron]] with common sense can see that lolgic thoroughly pwns syllo[[cum|gism]].

Syllo[[Cum|gism]] is used to [[Goronchev|Intellectually Checkmate]] trolls, but [[fail]]s.

The internet is full of [[idiots]].  [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is on the internet.  Therefore, Encyclopedia Dramatica is full of idiots.  Deductive syllogism!

==Women==
[[Women]] are teh opposites of logic. This has perplexed [[intellectual]]s since the early  [[At_least_100_years_ago|Victorian Era]]. At the time, it was believed that [[women]] lacked the ability to use logic because they were insatiably horny and motivated solely by their desire have sex and die at thirty-four, giving birth to their two-dozenth child. It was thought that without constant supervision, a woman would be seduced by the first bounder who got her alone and told her as long as they kept their clothes mostly on, it didn't count as sex.
 
While this is still very true, this stereotype has reversed itself in the 21st Century due largely to a massive PR campaign by shitty stand-up comedians and the [[feminazis]] who claim women are superior communicators, which is why they fill [[college]]s more than [[men]]. In actuality, this is complete bullshit that is only believed by other women and castrated liberal faggots, and college is for [[/b/tard]] [[fail]]res that can't get into universities (though universities suck too, as anyone with logic can enter them).

In reality, the only form of logic known to the common woman is girl logic. If you <s>decide</s> [[Joe Biden|are forced to argue with a woman]] do not be distracted by the following:

* [[Sarah Palin|Looking cute]]
* [[Sarah Palin|Winking]]
* [[Tits]]
* [[Miley Cyrus|Folksy-ism]] ("gosh darn it", "golly-gee wilickers" "there ya go Joe")
* [[Wat|Non sequiturs]] (Q: What is your stance on Turkey's refusal to acknowledge the [[Lies|Armenian Genocide of 1915]]? A: Let's talk about [[shit nobody cares about|Alaska]])

The appropriate counter-argument to women is the [[Vagina#EPIC_MONTAGE_OF_CUNTPUNT|cunt punt]].

'''Typical Example of Woman Logic''':

==Men==
It is thought that [[jews]] like [[Einstein]] invented logic. So according to correct lolgic:
{| border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 style="background:white"
|- style="background:#F0F0F0"
| '''Major Premise''' || '''Minor Premise''' || '''Conclusion'''
|-
| Jews are not [[stupid|human]] || men are [[stupid|human]] || Aristotle was a [[fucktard]] and jews are not humans
|}

'''Typical Example of Man logic''':
<youtube>amxwvdA_bSo</youtube>

Note the use of [[epic lulz]].

==[[Gurlfriend]]'s Wager==
[[Image:Lulzgraf.jpg|thumb|Gurlfriend's Wager]]

For the most part, logic and [[lulz]] are [[Math|inversely related]].

"The growth of lulzdom may be gauged exactly by the diminution of wise temper" (Wager's boyfriend)

==Logic in LiveJournal Political Communities==
===Inductive Reasoning===
Many [[retard]]s use inductive reasoning to prove their point. In an argument, do '''not''' draw [[attention]] to this fact, as they do not know what inductive  reasoning means or why it is wrong.

:'''''An example of inductive reasoning:'''''
<ins>This particular base in this particular area are belonging to us</ins>, therefore <INS>all your base are belong to us.</INS>

===Cow-is-Table Logic===
Similar to Inductive Reasoning, but taken a step further.
Cow-is-table logic is when you make two sensible points, and combine them in a [[stupid]] manner.

:'''''An example of cow-is-table logic:'''''
<ins>Tables have four legs; cows have four legs</ins>; therefore <INS>tables must be cows.</INS>

==Christian and Atheist Logic==
Both sides of the God argument are guilty of using really crappy-ass logic. If you really want to beat a [[Bible Thumper]] in a debate, then it might help to go over these logical fallacies.

===Appeal to Ignorance===
Ah, the ol' [[Intelligent Design]] argument. Just because there is no proof that something is false, then it must be true.
*There is no proof that God does not exist
*Therefore, God must exist

Appeal to Ignorance also works [[Bisexual|both ways]]. If there is no proof that something is true, then it must be false.
*There is no absolute proof that the universe was created by a Big Bang
*Therefore, the Big Bang never happened

===Circular Logic===
The most common logical fallacy, it happens when the conclusion reiterates the premises that supported it. In other words, its like saying that you were right to begin with ([[dumbass|and you weren't]]). More info can be found [[Circular Logic|here]].
*The Bible says that God exists
*The Bible was written by God
*Therefore, God exists

You just can't shove God in there at any time, you need to prove both points independently before putting them together. 
*[[Babyfuck|Unborn babies]] have a right to life
*Killing something with a right to life is the same as murder
*Therefore, [[abortion]] is murder

===False Dilemma===
[[Bill O'Reilly]] loves this one. It basically rules out the possibility of a neutral opinion on a topic by forcing you to pick one or the other.
*Either you believe in God or you are [[Communist|Un-American]]
*You do not believe in God
*Therefore, you are Jew

Another form of the false dilemma is the Trick Question, another [[Bill O'Reilly]] favourite. Here, you can't give a response without proving your opponent's point.
*Why do you hate [[America]]?

===Hasty Generalization===
If it wasn't for this logical fallacy, then [[stereotypes]] would not exist. In fact, Encyclopedia Dramatica would not exist either! Be thankful for this wonderful fallacy.
*[[Richard Dawkins]] is an asshole
*[[Richard Dawkins]] is an atheist
*Therefore, all atheists are assholes

As true as that statement may be, it won't hold up very well in a real argument. 

===Tu Quoque===
The opposite of [[NO U]], here a statement is justified simply because something else would just so happen to agree with it.
*Christians are responsible for killing people during the Crusades and the Inquisition
*Atheists are responsible for killing people in Eastern Europe during the Cold War
*Atheists are just as guilty as Christians when it comes to killing people

On the surface, this looks like a valid argument, but according to the evidence given, it is unknown if there really is a causal connection between Atheism and genocide ([[dumbass|and there isn't]]).

Another form of Tu Quoque is the Bandwagon Argument in which the validity of a premise is determined by its popularity. 
*There are lots of religions
*There are few forms of atheism
*Therefore, there is a greater chance of one religion being true

===Fallacist's Fallacy===
Also known as the Fuck You Fallacy or the [[Intellectual Checkmate]] and its commonly used by Atheists and [[Smugfag]]. Instead of debating the argument one premise at a time, you just blow it off completely just because one premise happens to be [[Delicious cake|fallacious]].
*[[Christfags]] say that Heaven must exist because no proof suggests otherwise
*That statement is an Appeal to Ignorance
*Therefore, Heaven must not exist
*You just got Intellectually Checkmated

===Weak Analogy===
Also known as Lousy-ass Analogy, Bullshit Analogy, or Anal-orgy. It happens when you actually do discover a connection between two premises but then assume that they share another connection. The entire concept of [[Intelligent Design]] is based on this exact proposition. 
*The universe has both simple parts and complex parts
*A common wristwatch has simple and complex parts
*All wristwatches are products of a creator
*Therefore, the universe must be the product of a creator

===Burden of Proof===
*Prove me wrong.

'''<font color=red>(USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)</font>'''

*but if you make the claim, you are the one who has to prove the claim, not me who has to disprove it

'''<font color=red>(USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)</font>'''

===Thought-terminating Cliché===

A statement that basically amounts to "bitch, shut the fuck up", but sounds like a valid response to a question or argument. May or may not be a [[fact]], but it never really resolves anything.

* '''Prima:''' Why does God allow a billion people worldwide to starve to death, but care about you getting a raise?
* '''Secunda:''' Because he works in mysterious ways, okay?

OR:

* '''Prima:''' I think the current mayor is corrupt and using his platform to get evolution out of schools.
* '''Secunda:''' This country was founded on Christian ideals. [[Why do you hate America?|Show some fucking national pride]], you [[Communism|commie]] dipshit.
