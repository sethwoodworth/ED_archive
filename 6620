Professor Tim Pierce is a true hero of the internets and trolled Wikipedia without even editing any articles. On January 21, 2007, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Katratszi anonymous] [[troll|announced]] on [[TOW|ToW]] that Professor Pierce of Northern Illinois University had assigned students in his class the task of vandalizing pages on the [[wikipedia|wikipedia social network and MMORPG]]. This [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Northern_Illinois_University&diff=102129721&oldid=101680387 announcement] was made by one of the students by actually inserting it into the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Northern_Illinois_University&oldid=102129721 discussion of the NIU article]. This [[asshole|student]] was awarded [[Tubgirl|extra credit]] in the course for being able to simultaneously vandalize TOW and create [[drama|great drama]] with a single action.

== WIKI:SS Plan to Invade Illinois ==
This demonstration of the Wikipedia's potential for displaying [[lies|propaganda]] was brought to the attention of the elite group of ToW [[Bureaucratic Fuck|Specialist Sysops]] commonly referred to in local beer halls as [[Nazi|WIKI:SS]]. The SS organization takes vandalism, real or perceived, [[serious business|very seriously]]. All members of the SS corps have been [[terrorist|trained]] by the head of [[TOW|the Reich]]. The SS members, who are chosen from the ranks of the [[wikipedophile|WIKI:YOUTH]] corp and become part of the [[fandom|inner circle]] of leadership, lovingly refer to him only as [[Jimbo Wales|Mein Fuhrer]].

The task of dealing with Professor Tim Pierce was assigned to the SS group's [[Zoe|SonderKommander]].  A brief meeting and display of histrionics was immediately undertaken at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive184#Professor_allegedly_telling_students_to_vandalize_wikipedia Wiki:Wannasee HQ], and a [[Last Measure|Final Solution]] was [[fucktard|half-assedly]] formed to deal with The Tim Pierce Question.

SS member [[tard|Psychonaut]] immediately called for the posting of [[docs]] for the professor, the dean of faculty, the president of the university, and the Office of Academic Misconduct. A squad was also asked to determine the IP address of anyone remotely related to Pierce, the University, or the City of Dekalb. Once the IP addresses were identified, the squad pinned yellow stars on them and shipped them to [[banned|WIKI:AUSCHWITZ]].

In an action that ensured a [[lollercaust]], Kommander [[Zoe]] was able to pressure the professor into making a confession by the clever use of [[spam]]. Zoe then began an effort to involve [[moar|more]] people in the tragidrama. When she presented her [[bullshit|case]] and threats of [[internet law|legal action]] to NIU's president and Public Relations Department, it was suggested that she bring her concern to the [[IRL]] Legal Department. The NIU faculty was not at all impressed with her "I'm telling [[your mom]]" approach. The full summary of the exchange can be found [[zoe|here]]. In brief: the NIU:[[IRL]]LEGALDEPT informed her that legal action could not be taken, because the actions of the professor were clearly outside the jurisdiction of [[online|Fantasyland]]. They also suggested that the appropriate action would be for her to [[STFU]].

== Mission Not Accomplished ==
The attention surrounding this incident threatened to expose the [[Nazi|WIKI:SS]] to public scrutiny.  The [[Jimbo Wales|Fuhrer]] recognized the danger that such publicity posed, especially since the construction of the [[final solution|second oven]] had not yet been completed, and decided to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=103574102 publicly admonish] her for her actions. This resulted in the Kommander [[wikicide|setting herself on fire while being shot in the head]]. This was probably done for [[attention whore|nefarious reasons]], as there are current reports of the [[Nazi|WIKI:SS]] gathering nasty emails, and several large crates from the ACME company, on the eastern German border &mdash; if they cannot [[win]] the internets they can at least take another shot at [[Poland|Case White]].

[[an hero|The Professor]] has announced plans for incorporating his teaching methods into NIU's [[troll|drama department]]. Advanced [[Lulz|WIKI:STOP]] courses will be added in the following semesters; these are to cover the more subtle methods of getting your point across.

The incident did bring some interesting things to light:
*[[Piotrus]] contributed large amounts of fuel that were poured directly onto the fire.
*The [[wikipedia:WP:PARADOX|TOW:PARADOX]] was formally acknowledged.
*Professor Tim Pierce was awarded the Skynet Peace Prize for his efforts to prevent TOW from becoming self-aware.
