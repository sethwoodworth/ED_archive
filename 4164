'''JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR''' started around Feb. 2006 from an image showing "basic electronics symbols" (see right), of which the lion was one, of course (source: [http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/archives/2005/Aug www.toothpastefordinner.com]). This image was posted on 4chan's /b/ board, with the text "ALL I LERNED IN COLEGE". After some fail discussion about correct electronics symbols, some heroic b-tard proved that kittens could save the thread and posted the now-infamous >:3-in-a-circle face with the text "RAWR I AM A LION". This image was subsequently posted and reposted at a furious rate over the next few days in various humorous photoshoppings, which vaulted the combination of >:3, "RAWR I Am A LION" and "JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR" into meme history.

'''JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR''' later served as inspiration for the short lived [[Operation LIONCASH]] which was based on the '''>:3''' smiley.

Near-background-level lulz were gained from the fact that one of the lines in ''[[Cloverfield]]'' - to wit, "It's alive, it's huge!" - was mistaken by [[13 year old boy|13 year old]] [[btards]] for "It's a lion, it's huge." Sadly this provides no humor other than to poignantly highlight the fact that ''Cloverfailed'' fans are a bunch of slavering tards who will read hidden meaning into anything.

'''JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR''' was made into a movie in 2007.  This [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey_%282007_film%29 piece of shit] was about two little bastard [[pedophile|kids]] trapped in a car with their [[dyke|dykey]] [[cunt|cunt]] step-mom while they waited for her [[furfag|manly]] husband to find them.  But outside of this car was a [[gay|Pride]] of HUNGRY [[goatse|ASS]] LIONS
