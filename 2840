{{needsmore|links to LJ faked deaths}}
{{ljcomm|fake_lj_deaths}} is a [[LiveJournal]] [[community]] where e-[[detective]]s exercise their skills to catch other users [[Death#Hoax Death/FakevDeath|faking their own deaths]].

==Theory==
LiveJournal-using [[attention whore]]s occasionally become so unbalanced that they think it's a good idea to kill themselves, but more often they think that [[pseudocide|pseuicide]] or fake [[cancer]] is a better way to go. Some users have also been discovered inventing illnesses and deaths for their children or SOs, who may or may not also be invented.

Fake LJ deaths exists, according to its members, to end the emotional manipulation and occasional fraud practiced by internet [[lie|liars]]. Others freely admit to being there for the [[lulz]], but generally a person who posts to ask about a "friend" will receive sympathy from comm members if he or she has been fooled.

The tone of the community is [[The Internet is serious business|very serious]], with the usual response to a post being not "[[YHBT]]" but "Let's [[ruin]] that motherfucker." Many members there have been victims of LJ fakers, and hold a grudge against anyone who does the same.

It is important to distinguish between intentional [[troll]]ing, which the community will no longer deal with, and faked deaths, which are executed by people who genuinely want others to care about them. One is done for the lulz of fooling everybody with ridiculous stories, while the other is done out of a sick need for e-[[hugs]] and the desire to cause genuine pain to others.

==Textbook fake LJ death==
#Make a happy post with a hint of foreshadowing, so that people can find it and freak out over it.
#Refrain from posting for the next twelve hours, if you can possibly manage it.
#Post again, claiming to be a boyfriend, a sibling, or a friend, who just happens to have your journal password. Tell your friends that you're ill or injured, in the hospital, and clinging to life.
#If you're satisfied with the attention this gets you, you can return at this point, and spend the next several months recovering with the sympathy and e-love of your friends.
#Should you decide to continue, make another post as your "friend," regretfully informing your f-list that you died tragically and beautifully.
#Sit back and let the grief of others make your [[cock]] hard.
