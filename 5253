McPedo is Ronald McDonald's alias when he takes little children to the restroom to fulfill his evil clownish intentions. He has reached legendary pedo status, rubbing shoulders with [[Brian Peppers]], [[PedoBear]], [[Subservient Chicken]] and the elusive Jamie Peers, proprieter of mole station nusery. He has been known to prowl around the likes of Shanghai and Bangkok for obvious reasons and caution is recommended. He can also be seen on the likes of [[4chan]] and WTFux [http://wtfux.org]

[[Scientists]], until recently, suspected that this behavior is a recent phenomenon. However, [[basement dwellers|maverick researchers]] at ED have recently unearthed archival footage that proves this has been going on [[at least 100 years ago|far longer than any had previously thought]].

Understandably, this is propably what happens to people who not only have Kroc's disease, but some demented bastardization of mad cow's disease as well from those kitchens that the Burger King would buttraep Ronald for letting his underpaid sla-employees practically let the cockroaches tell them what to do.


Of course, it's not just all these weird infectious McDonalds hamburger related illnesses, but enough phallic imagery related to the food to make Sigmund Freud himself want to molest children. 


Ronald and the hamburgler look like a tag team of loli lovers already, when one has to be slapped in the face by the general fucknuttery of the way they dress themselves up. Almost as if they put on adult sized dress-up clothes or full-size Haloween costumes.


Although, cricisms aside, their clothes do fulfill the main function of letting a clown-the scariest dressed asshole in the history of the world-to get close to his prey of choice.
