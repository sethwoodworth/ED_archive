Herb Smith
[[Image:Herbcopypasta.jpg|thumb|right|The man himself.]]

Herb Smith is the name of a fictional person who supposedly left his wife after [[Pregnant|knocking her up]], leaving her to her obvious incompetency of parenting (being a [[woman]]).  Her son supposedly grew up to be [[B|a degenerate teenager, a sociopathic miserable being who has no compassion or empathy]].  The copypasta claims that his ex-wife saw the [[Anonymous]] report on [[Fox News]], and tried to take advantage of the situation.

However, being a [[woman]], she had no idea what she was doing, and flaunted her [[unwarranted self-importance]] around on [[B|/b/]] with threats of [[hacking]] the site down with her [[firefox|1337-w4r3z]].  If Anonymous did not agree to track down and destroy her ex-husband.

==But [[Serious Business|Seriously]]==

It's just another stupid [[copypasta]] aborted from the [[anus]] of [[B|/b/]].  After the thread was posted, it was subject to dozens of [[Hilary Clinton]] and [[Hulk Hogan]] variations, as well as endless "THIS IS HERB SMITH" posts.
