Peter C. Hayward is a [[Unfunny|stand-up improvisational comedian]], [[rape|rape advocate]] and [[attention whore]] from Brisbane, Australia who recently decided to live rough on the streets on the streets of Melbourne like a filthy beggar for a month, to <strike>raise awareness for the homeless</strike> shamelessly drum up publicity for his mediocre <strike>writing project</strike> blog.

The reaction from Melburnites was mixed, but the vast majority of Livejournal fags was one of "[[GTFO]]". Some settled for simple blind [[RAEG|rage]], while others encouraged acts of physical violence or attempted murder of him at his publicised weekly meet and greets.

== Initial Public Response ==

The first Melbourne heard of Peter's plans was [http://community.livejournal.com/melbournemaniac/3310555.html in this livejournal article], in which he writes:

{{quote|So next month, I'm doing a project I've wanted to do for a long time: I'm going down to Melbourne with nothing but the clothes on my back, a sleeping bag, and a backpack, and living on the streets for 28 days.

I'm not taking my phone, I'm not taking any money, I'm not booking a hotel or staying in a backpackers. When I say "living on the streets", I mean it literally.

My mother, for obvious reasons, is terrified that I'm going to be dead before the month is through. I've promised to do extensive research before I go to minimise the chances of "death". I've been reading through websites and guides, but I thought I'd ask - has anyone reading this ever had to live on the streets? What tips would you give to prevent death? Also; I don't know Melbourne at all. What areas should I avoid? Do you know any places that offer food to the homeless, anything like that? (when I'm done, I'll be donating money to any organisations that helped me. I don't want genuine homeless people to miss out because of me.)

I'll be doing a post with more details in a couple of days, in a question-and-answer format. If you have any questions about the project at all, leave them here, and I'll answer them then.

Thanks for your help!}}


The response was a mixture of advice and outright abuse, including:

{{quote|Are you fucking retarded? I mean really. Is there something wrong with your brain that you think living on the streets for a month when you can count down the days til you're home living with mumsie again is going to be like anything to do with what being homeless is actually like? }}

{{quote|You gon' die. }}

{{quote|If you ignore the general cussing and vitriol in this comm then there's a lot of sense and wisdom here. I sincerely hope you take these messages to heart before you embark on your white, middle-class quest to romanticise homeless life. }}



== Life on the streets ==
[[File:Peter_c_hayward(1).jpg|thumb|300px]]
Peter's experience has been faithfully documented by his brother on his blog (in which Peter posts a letter every day outlining his meagre purchases and run-ins with BIG MEAN BULLY security guards), somewhat moronically named "Pictures and Words". [[Some argue]] that this title is deceptive, as the blog features very little by the way of pictures, and [[TLDR|far too many fucking words]].

Some choice excerpts from his [http://www.peterchayward.com/ blog]:


{{quote|9:30 – I can see pretty clearly through the bush, so I watch people through that and then pretend to be asleep when they can see me as well. An elderly couple doing a lap of the park clearly notice me, so I watch them until they come around the bush. When I open my eyes again, they’re standing over me, looking concerned. I try to act as if I’ve just woken up.|No, no, that's not creepy AT ALL.}}

{{quote|Now, I realise that I was in the wrong- intruding on what was apparently private property- and I realise that she was just doing her job, and I realise that I’ve been completely spoiled by only pleasant encounters with security guards (and people in general, in fact) but did she have to be so rude??|[[NO U]]}}


In fact, the only thing the blog is good for is the psychopathic rantings of the commenters on each entry:





== Don't be like that over a few tiny rape jokes! ==

As the internet resentment grew over the incalcuable damage Peter was doing to the homeless community (at that, point $1500 raised for the non-profit providing services to the homeless), a Livejournal poster had the earth-shattering idea to check out Peter's [[Youtube|Jewtube]] page for some dirt on him.

In one of his improv sketch videos, Peter jokes about rape. This causes those already enraged with him to [[shit bricks]] like never before, prompting his brother to fly into an [[USI]]-soaked spin control [[barrel roll]]: 

{{quote|The main thing I wanted to talk about (quickly, as I have to leave for work soon) is that what people say while on stage mostly isn’t real. Remember this, it will be important later on. In the clip, for those of you who haven’t watched it, Peter makes some (yes, rather crude) jokes about his “mother” and “father”. Remember what I said just before, about things on stage not always being real? That’s right, this is one of them.|Peter's brother, justifying [[rape]] jokes.}}

==Romantic Life==

Peter is obsessed with [[Ginger|Redheads]], some of which hit on other guys in front of him at his own party when they are dating him. For several years, Peter was known as a [[virgin|virgin by choice]], which was a [[lie]], because he lost his [[Vtech|v-card]] at the first oppurtunity to a (redheaded) slut who could look up to [[Gary Coleman]] in heels.

==Skills==

Peter has skills in a great many areas, but there is one skill he has never obtained: the ability to shut the fuck up. This [[patronising]] and [[self-righteous]] [[man|manchild]] posts every single thought he has, no matter how shitty online. For the attention, he has recently taken to stealing images for 4chan and taking credit for them in an album called "Engraved Paint" on facebook. In addition, he scribbles crappy doodles on notebook paper of an amorphous blob that is apparantly a bee, and calling this a comic, despite the lack of storyline or humour. He is also known for filming a recreation of Twilight, starring himself as Edward and his sister as Bella.



== Other Hobbies ==
Besides pretending to be a dirty hobo, Peter has other hobbies.

Yeah, sure, okay.
