Zombie Apocalypse

Sometime in the near future, a [[government]] laboratory deep beneath the surface of the earth will botch an experiment creating legions of [[zombie]]s who will feast on human [[brain]]s and destroy [[asking for it|humanity]]. This scenario is a popular subject of discussion [[OTI]], in uber-nerd [[fanfic]], and an always popular thread topic on [[/b/]].  

==[[unrealistic expectations|Survival]]==

When it actually occurs, very few living [[human]]s will remain. Some [[some argue|speculate]] about who will survive and who will become [[food|lunch]], plans about [[weapon]]s, hideouts, and fuel and food supplies are frequently laid out by [[basement dwellers|pale-skinned]] geeks who have never seen real firearms much less the light of day.  

[[Zombie]]s tend to inhabit cities having to do with Ra[[coon]]s, or in a case of a shitty movie (''[[Uwe Boll|House of the Dead]]''), a random [[Mexican]] island. Most of the time weapons can be found simply by looking around. And in cases of zombie infestations you usually have to solve inordinate amounts of shitty puzzles that means going back 3 chapters in the game to find a fucking spider emblem and a [[dildo]].

==Types of Zombie Infestations==

Zombies can be created several ways, most commonly through genetic experimentation gone wrong or malicious voodoo curses. 
Most commonly the government itself or an evil [[corporation]] experiments with viruses or other microbes and the infecting agent escapes into the general population, killing most and then reanimating them. These walking corpses ravenously hunt down the living. Generally there is no cure.  Severing the head or destroying the [[brain]] is the only guaranteed way to completely kill a zombie. 

In the case of a voodoo curse, the zombie is usually a person enslaved by a [[pedo|priest]] or [[asking for it|priestess]] through black person magic and is used to carry out the [[sex|whims]] of their [[necrophilia|master,]] often for the purpose of [[lulz]]. These zombies are nowhere near as mindless as their corporate counterparts, and can be saved from zombification by [[killing]] the priest who cursed them. 

Sometimes, in case of zombie infestations, there are usually instances of mutated or enlarged creatures like [[spider]]s, worms, [[dog]]s and sloths that all somehow become zombie-fied and/or giant. There's probably a [[furry]] [[fetish]] somewhere out there for <del>one</del> all of these.

==Common Types of [[Zombies]]==
There are different types of zombies that are considered to be threats in different ways.
*'''Normal Zombies''' - These are the zombies that you see in all the regular zombie movies, the ones that walk REALLY slow, but will still get closer to you NO MATTER HOW FAST YOU RUN.
*'''Running Zombies''' - These are zombies that resemble the super hero 'The Flash'. And goddamn, they run fast.
*'''WTF Zombies''' - I have no fucking idea what these are, but they sound and look fucking CRAZY. You meet one and your fucking DEAD.

==[[Apocalypse]] Predictions==
There have been many predictions on when the Zombie Apocalypse will actually happen. The most recent one was [[Last Thursday]] on [[b|/b/]] predicting that the Zombie Apocalypse would happen on the first day of the New Year. This was proven wrong.
