There are currently [[Over 9000|over 9,000]] expansion packs, and a new expansion pack is released every week, which means nonstop gaming [[fun]]. Basically a game for [[basement dwellers|failures]] and [[/b/tards]] to create a virtual versions of themselves, only it has a mansion, sports car, [[secks]] with their very own [[wimminz]], and a job, so they can pretend they have a life, only on the computer, [[Second Life|sound familiar?]]

== Gameplay ==

[[Image:Sims2.jpg|thumb|right|[[ROFL]] look @ the [[IRL]]-style reactions.]]
[[Image:Iizinurgame.jpg|thumb|right|If you think your Sims are annoying and uncontrollable, try out the pets!]]

Imagine, if you will:

<i>You wake up hungover on the floor of your living room on Sunday morning.  You look for your phone and your wallet but it seems you lost them last night.  You feel a distinct itch at your crotch: looks like that bitch last night gave you the crabs.  You hear a knock at your door: it's the police. [[Jailbait|Turns out she was only 14]] and her parents are pressing rape charges.  Oh, and by the way, she's pregnant too.  You're pretty much fucked aren't you. Then SUDDENLY JOSEF FRITZL AND FUCKING HITLER AND SOME SHIT FUCKING RAPE YOU IN THE FUCKING ASS ON THE FUCKING FLOOR MOTHERFUCKER OH SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII</i>

Imagine that, and you are experiencing the comedy and non-stop fun of "The Sims". The mechanics of the game are simple enough to appeal to old men and even the most [[Whore|whorish]] of [[16 year old girls]] when they can tear themselves away from [[MySpace]]. The best description of ''The Sims'' is a cross between Shit Boring and Real Life minus the Real part. The main appeal of the game is having to work 8-10 hours a day at a repetitive, dead-end [[IRL]]-style job in order to feed your needy, [[IRL]]-style family members in a draining cycle whose only incentive is the hope of saving up enough money to take an [[IRL]]-style vacation or sending your [[IRL]]-style spawn to an [[IRL]]-style college. An added appeal is the inability of your sims to perform basic tasks, such as eating and [[Crap|toilet-time]], without your assistance. For example, if [[you]] tell your sim to get [[in the kitchen]] and turn your head away for 5 seconds, you will find your sim [[An Hero|pwning herself]] with [[Kill it with fire|fire]].

One of the many ways to torture sims. The only real way to play the game.

== The Sims Communities ==
[[Image:Sims2toilet.jpg|thumb|left|In the world of [[sick fuck|''Sims 2'' custom content-makers]], this is a toilet.]]

Sims communities are ''The Sims'''s contribution to the [[internets]]. [[Forum|Ultraforums]], such as [http://www.thesimszone.co.uk/ The Sims Zone], allow ''Sims'' gamers to download extra [[IRL]]-style features for their ''Sims'' game, share [[IRL]]-style ''Sims'' experiences with fellow ''Sims'' gamers, and other [[IRL]]-style aspects which can be found outside of a ''Sims'' gamer's home, [[IRL]].

[[Image:Sims2rape.JPG|thumb|right|A typical [[crap|story]] found on the Sims2 Exchange. RapeMama's daughter is most likely a [[Mary-Sue]].]]

The [http://www.thesims2.ea.com ''Sims 2'' official site] is obviously the largest of the ''Sims''' communities, probably because it is [[internet police|official]]. At this particular site, one can find such exciting things as the [[forum|BBS]] and the exchange. Once a place of epic trolling by people bored with the sims, the BBS is now home to [[13-year-old boys]], [[16-year-old girls]], and [[pedophiles]] pretending to be [[16-year-old girls]]. If one does not like [[Twilight]] or the [[Jonas Brothers]] you will feel very out of place. It should be avoided at all costs. The exchange is home to pure [[crap]] made by [[lolicon|small children]] who think they are now [[serious business|intranet celebrities]] because they know how to take a Maxis mesh, bucket-fill it in MS Paint, slap on face #1 in Bodyshop. Ta-da! The exchange is also home to stories by 9-year-olds with [[poor|horrific graphics cards]] and a [[all caps|broken caps lock key]].

There are also fan communities like [[Snooty sims]], but who gives a fuck about that?

===Garden Of Shadows===
[http://www.digitalperversion.net/gardenofshadows GoS] is an alternative internet forum for The Sims. They're pretty much [[emo|emus]] who listen to [[MCR]] and cut themselves because they're emus.

[[Image:Emus.png|thumb|left|Their layout just screams [[emo|emu.]]]]

intProp censorGridSize 0 in ''The Sims 2'' will remove the blur over the characters genitals. There is also a nude patch, and thousands of custom skins which feature naked sims. All of these result in [[barbie]]-doll like pubic areas.

In case you are retarded and [[How is babby formed?|don't understand how the game works]], characters can have children. This means that ''The Sims 2'' (especially combined with a [[screencap]]) can be used to acquire [[lolicon]]. However, there are ways to avoid having to seeing naked children, even while having your sims be nude. The best way is to not have children, so why not have a family of hot [[lesbian]]s? This is fun and arousing for all people who enjoy [[fap]]ping over a collection of pixels. 

[[Fag]]s like [[Jack Thompson]] believe that ''The Sims'' will turn people into "flesh eating zombie rapists."

All prons are for the following people:

* [[Gays]]
* [[Otherkin|The other ones]]
* [[Furrys]]
* [[Spider]]s
* [[Hentai]] freaks
* Fall Out Boy fans
* [[Mpreg]] fetishists
* [[Pedophiles]]
* [[You]] as usual.

== Neighborhoods ==
In the Sims, you can make [[boring|exciting]] neighborhoods with custom terrains, objects, and streets. [[Shit nobody cares about|An example of a custom neighborhood that took too fucking long to make:]]

== The OMGWTFBBQ ==
[[Last Thursday]], [[Pirate|Pescado]], the owner of [http://paysites.mustbedestroyed.org/ ''Paysites Must Be Destroyed''] submitted a barbeque enabling Sims to turn babies into [[Delicious_cake|delicious steak]] onto major custom content site ''Mod The Sims 2''. Not only did the admins approve that download (presumably [[I_did_it_for_the_lulz|doing it for the lulz]]), but they added a warning that any user to post a [[BAWWWWW|whiny]] comment would be b&. Of course, [[Concerned_mother|concerned mothers]] wouldn't have any of that, flocked to the thread and expressed not only their [[butthurt]] over pixel babies being eaten, but also their urge to [[Insane#Batshit|kill the admin's actual offspring]].

{{Quote|J. M. Pescado your a [[pussy]] ass, [[faggot]] ass, [[LOL_WUT|hook ass]], son of a bitch! You [[Sick_fuck|sick twisted fag]]! | A [[concerned mother]]}}

{{Quote|(To the admin) I hope your baby is burned alive :)| Another [[concerned mother]]}}

{{frame|<youtube>kG2EQEsGFCc</youtube><br><center>'''The OMGWTFBBQ in action'''</center>|color=grey}}

Being [[banned]] from ''MTS2'' wasn't enough for those butthurt members, and they had to create a site to "save the Sims babies", complete with open letter to ''MTS2'' hoping to get the download taken down, text shittily translated from German, virtual pinboard full of cutesy pictures of real babies, baby sounds in the background and [[Geocities]]-like webdesign. It can be found [http://savethesimbabies.npage.eu/ here]'''BAAAWWWleted''' for those who have the urge to [[goatse]] their pinboard.

| This site hurts my eyes more than the thumbnails for the OMGWTFBBQ. The left menu is hard to read... not to mention that cheesy baby sound effect every time I click on something and the use of frames meaning that its impossible to link to a specific page of your site. | Anonymous visitor of the site, trolling

| Kiddo, I´m really worried about your brain ! If you can´t bear it - leave it ! And why would you link to a special page of our site ? | Kaloka, about the previous message
