DOS game
A '''DOS [[shit|game]]''' is a game that was from before the ancient Atari 52 system. Many [[idiots|people]] claim that these "games" were better than the modern games of today. Though some are good, like the [[Monkey Island]] series, but most of them just plain [[rimjob|suck ass]]. __FORCETOC__

[[Image:Wolfenstein_3D.jpg|thumb|Seriously, who the fuck wants to play this shit?!]] 

== Main DOS Games ==
'''Doom''': The only good [[Virginia Tech massacre|shooter]] for the Windows 95.

'''Monkey Island 1 & 2''': Hilarious point-and-click adventure games that you should (for serious) check out.

'''Betrayal at Krondor''': One friggin soundtrack that was remixed for different towns. Also spawned a novel series. 

'''Wolfenstein''': See [[Halo|shit]].

'''Corridor 7''': A game that possibly doesn't exist, and can only be loved by the [[Crossmack|most pretentious pseudo-intellectual in the world.]]

'''Operation: Body Count''': The authentic counter-terrorist experience, right down to [[fucktarded|using a shotgun as a backup weapon]] and the [[WTF|hell rats.]]

'''Blood''': No wait, the [[Half-Life|OTHER good shooter.]]

'''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]''': A game starring a guy who [[Chris Benoit|kicks ass, takes names, and occasionally murders babies]]. This is the [[Columbine|OTHER OTHER good shooter]] for the DOS.

'''Blake Stone''': An epic quest for a [[drugs|crack rock]].

'''Heretic''': DOOM with elves. For halfwits who couldn't really play D&D.

'''Hexen''': A heinously pixelated sequel to Heretic. For [[Morons|people]] who are tired of [[fun|shooting things in the face]] and would rather [[Retarded|go through tons of dungeons, trying to find a key that ends up being invisible]]. With that said, it has pretty good gib deaths.

'''[[Dungeons & Dragons]] Gold Box series''': Ancient precursor to ''Baldur's Gate'' and other modern PCRPGs, these catered primarily to friendless [[neckbeard]]s, who had no one with whom they could play [[Dungeons & Dragons]] [[IRL]].

'''X-Com: UFO Defense''': [[tl;dr| Originally called UFO: Enemy Unknown in Europe before being released as XCOM outside of the UK]]. You commanded an organization of [[Halo| gun-toting marines who had to fight off a plasma-toting coalition of aliens]], as you stole their UFOs, their guns, and their brains while harvesting moar Elerium-115. Was actually a sadistically challenging game assuming you didn't save every single turn, and reload the second your squad got wiped out by a stray Blaster Bomb.

'''System Shock''': A boring game about [[Hackers]] and stuff, [[TL;DR]] stuff is everywhere written by the small group of people who have actually played it.

== Brain Damage ==
It is [[Common knowledge|commonly known]] around gaming communities that DOS games can cause [[wrestling|brain damage]], due to the [[Linkin Park|terrible amount of bad techno riffs and repetitive explosions]]. Play at your own risk. People who play this sort of game will give you a long, complicated argument as for why they play them, such as [[tl;dr|WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT WHAT I PLAY SO MUCH! JUST BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE MODERN GAMES LIKE THE REST OF YOU DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD BE]] [[Bullshit|RACIST AGAINST ME!]] [[ALL CAPS|I LOVE OLD DOS GAMES BECAUSE THEY HAVE HEART AND SOUL, WHILE GAMES LIKE THE DARKNESS ARE JUST ABOMINATIONS AGAINST MANKIND!]] [[Lie|YOU'RE SO IGNORANT!]]

Of course, anyone with half a brain knows that these people are just [[batshit insane|misunderstood]].
