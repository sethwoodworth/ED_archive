A Message From Chad and Steve
{{stub}}

'''A Message From Chad and Steve''' is a particularly virulent form of Internets faggotry and [[FAIL]] that occurs when you attempt to embed a [[YouTube]] vidya on a site such as [[ED]] and mangle the [[URL]] or vidya ID code. 

==The Vidya==

If YouTube had an iota of wit or creativity, they might have seen the [[Oh Exploitable]] potential in this common user exploit and created something resembling lulz. Perhaps something akin to ED's [[No niggers|own prank]] when it is discovered that the fags at [[reddit]] are [[hotlinking]] to an ED image and stealing [[Girlvinyl]]'s valuable and coveted bandwidthz. But no, all you get is the same crappy, gay YouTube of the company's founders Steve Chen and Chad Hurley 'goofing around' announcing YouTube's [[old meme|forthcoming merger]] with [[Google]] and calling themselves [[USI|'kings']].

The actual vidya itself can be found [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCVxQ_3Ejkg here]. You can help by downvoting it and leaving disgusting comments. The [[9000]] plus comments themselves are a treasure trove of lulz and [[DGT]]s and primed for [[trolling]]. As for the stats, lol ED.


[[Image:Youtube_statsPM.png|frame|center|Note that [[over 9000]] retards from ED have accidentally embedded this YouTube vidya. '''WE'RE #2...w007'''!!!]]
