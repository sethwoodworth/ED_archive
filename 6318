Pedofox
[[Image:Yiff_Fox_by_jsquirrel.jpg|thumb|right|"I thought a sheep was a bad choice for the 'furry' perversion, so here's my fox version." Translation: I'd rather stick my wiener into this fox, 'cause sheep are just dirty.]]
'''Pedofox''',  aka '''Yiff Fox''' of the [[Pedopals]], was a derivative plagiarism of Pedobear (though all the Pedopals were "plagiarized") from [[At least 100|some years ago]]. It may be making a comeback, and thus begin generating some [[lulz]] (especially if [[trolling]] and [[Photoshop]]s were to become involved). Time will tell.

==Pedofox: Birth, Life and Death==

In early 2005, a [[furry]] on [[DeviantART]] named [http://jsquirrel.deviantart.com/ Jiffy Squirrel], who was [[Obvious|obviously]] familiar with [[4chan|4chan's]] classic Pedobear mascot/meme, decided he didn't approve of the character [[lolwut|Furry Sheep]] in the pedo-spinoff Pedo and Friends (see right). Determined to generate a more [[Unfunny|suitable]] replacement, he fired up ye olde Photoshop and began tracing a pre-extising work -- in other words, doing the same shit that furries are famed and reviled for. His bastard child of a creation was named [[Yiff]] Fox, and soon posted online to DeviantART. The critical reaction was about what you'd expect from a forum frequented by those who spiritually consider themselves non-human/think the idea of fornicating with animals is pretty cool:  [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/15619344/125908836  "Awww so cute!"] Viva la [[faggotry]]. 

Surprisingly, it would take over a year before someone, a commenter named [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/15619344/298793418 fieldmarshal], came out and said this fox thingy was obviously ganked from Pedobear (though [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/15619344/189342974 another guy] with a [[Cockmongler]] avatar had earlier remarked, "Too bad you don't [sic.] make this.") Fieldmarshall naturally redubbed "Yiff Fox" the far more appropriate moniker "Pedofox." A few lulzy comments were made in the otherwise short and unremarkable thread (see Gallery), and most people thereafter referred to the character as Pedofox. A few days later, Jiffy Squirrel "Editted description to denote linage," whatever the fuck that means.

Sometime after this, Pedofox was re-appropriated for the 4chan [[Pedopals]] lineup, though he was identified as "Yiff Fox" because Pedobear does not tolerate competition for delicious [[loli]]. He would more or less die in the bowels of [[B|/b/]], and until recently was presumed to be yiffing in hell, where all things furry go (see [[Mexico]]).

==Pedofox Reloaded==
[[Image:furpiledotorg screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|It's even creepier if they already know...]]
[[Last Thursday]], a crack [[Google]] image search team spotted offender Pedofox on the front page of an  under-construction furry website named [http://www.furpile.org furpile.org] under his old alias of Yiff Fox. Apparently, he faked his own death and is currently taking advantage of his mentor Pedobear's lifetime incarceration for [[CP]] to snatch the underaged furries of the Internet for himself. One can only marvel at the brazen genius of his plan, in particular his targeting of a specific subculture where the bar for deviancy has already been placed way the fuck down. Well played, Pedofox, well played!
