'''Think B4 You Speak''' is a series of [[PROTIP|PSA]]s by the Ad Council that tell viewers that calling things "[[gay]]" is offensive, and what if someone referred to [[stupid]] things by [[you]]r name? How would '''YOU''' [[Lol|feel]]?


==Quotes that are SOOO Gay==
Here are some choice quotes from the [http://www.thinkb4youspeak.com/StoriesAndVideos/ official website].

<center>{{frame|{{morphquote|sogayquotes|background-color: #E5CDFD; width: 900px; height: 200px;|font-weight: none;|Hi there, I try to remind people how offensive it is to hear God's name used as a filth word. I hear it all over, in my neighborhood, in movies, etc. People are always saying "Jesus Christ" or "G-d D-mn" (they never say anything about Mohammed or Buddha or anyone else) and not only do I find it very offensive because Jesus is my Lord and Savior, and would like it to stop, but God does too. In the Ten Commandments he says, "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him blameless who takes His name in vain." I would never demean anyone (as in [[NO U|"That's so gay"]]) and would appreciate if everyone would take those phrases out of their vocab as well. Thanks for letting me post|J H from Minnesota

|At my school and library, there are people that say 'Oh, that Halo mod is SO GAY' or 'That English assignment was SO GAY' or 'You are SO GAY' Get the trend? It isn't cool to say 'SO GAY' and whenever I hear this phrase used out of context, I say 'Please stop'. Unfortunatly, it doesn't always work and people still say it. Please help to stop this saying by talking to your school administrator to make a rule that says 'DON'T SAY "THAT'S SO GAY!'.|HALO IS SO GAY


|My name is kayla and i have a really big issue with people saying "that is so gay" or "your gay"...My mother is gay and i dont think there is a problem with gay parents or gay people...My friends say all the "[[You're/your|your]] gay"...i really hate hearing it and am always telling them to stop...i think it is offensive to people that are gay...I mean people think it is such a big deal if someone is gay but its really not...You cant help who you fall in love with and if that is someone of the same sex then SO BE IT...there is nothing wrong with it and i am trying really hard to get people to stop saying things about gay people...its not fair to them and i no it hurts there feelings because people make fun of my mom and her wife all the time and i see how bad it hurts her...i couldnt tell you how many times at school or work i have had to take up for my mother and tell them to leave her alone...its actually sad to see how they get treated...they even tried to adopt a child and the lady they talked to said we dont deal with gay people sorry...i mean how rude is that???I just think people need to learn respect and respect other people...|Kayla, who doesn't know [[your]] and [[you're]]}}|color=#C797F9}}</center>

==Contradiction==
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ejCqgAKZ-M In the "Pizza Shop" video], [[black chicks|Wanda Dykes]] tells the little [[fag]], "how would you feel that if I thought this pepper shaker was dumb and stupid, I said it was so [[13 year-old boy|16 year-old boy with a cheesy mustache]]?" Dumb could mean a [[Lol|mute]] person, and [[stupid]] could mean retarded. So retards and people who can't talk are A-OK to make fun of but not [[fag]]s? [[owned|Okay then]].

Not to mention gay originally meant something happy or fun, and brightly colored and showy, which could refer to a [[high|neon colored looking gnome]]. It later became a term for [[slut|prostitutes]] and [[faggot|manwhores]]. So those fucking faggots stole a word that wasn't even theirs and want you to remember how [[lolwut|wonderful it is to be a brightly colored manwhore.]]

==Stupidity==
This entire campaign is rendered even more stupid because most fags don't actually give a shit about it. When you call something "gay" you don't mean "homosexual", you mean "bad". Evidently a couple of fat bullkdykes felt like getting some attention so they made a bunch of shit up and pretended they had the moral high ground. You know, just like every other "moral campaign".
