'''''Mein Kampf''''' was [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[LiveJournal]] before LiveJournal was invented. At about [[tl;dr|650 pages]], there was no aspect of his heart-rending [[emo|loneliness and misery]] which went undescribed in it. 

==History==
It is [[common knowledge]] among <del>[[white nationalism|white supremacists]]</del> black person hating [[bitches]] that ''Mein Kampf'' is a [[Bible]], which, despite the absolute lack of literary merit in the actual Bible, is meant by them as high praise. 

The writing style is, like modern [[LiveJournal]]s, stream-of-consciousness, focusing entirely on what is wrong with the world and containing absolutely no recommendations for [[final solution|solutions]]. Being forced to read it and memorize its contents has been proposed as an alternative [[torture]] method for suspected [[terrorist]]s, but the proposal was shot down by [[retard]]s who thought it would be more [[politically correct]] to just deprive the [[terrorist|ragheads]] of sleep, oxygen, and any semblance of sanity; this helps to make them skilled productive citizens when they are released.  Also notable in this work is the fact that the Jew are found to be the cause for the calamities of the world only half as much as [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|here]].  Hitler's investigative abilities were lacking with his available tools, lest he would have discovered that the Jews were indeed responsible for every [[9/11|major]] and [[Insane Clown Posse|minor]] disaster in modern history. It is reported that [[Mel Gibson|this guy]] sleeps with a copy under his pillow everywhere he goes. ''Mein Kampf'''s well-reasoned and insightful text, excerpted below, can be found [http://www.hitler.org/writings/Mein_Kampf/ here].

==Excerpt==
''All the human culture, all the results of [[art]], [[science]], and [[internet|technology]] that we see before us today, are almost exclusively the creative product of the [[white|Aryan]]. This very [[fact]] admits of the not unfounded inference that he alone was the founder of all higher humanity, therefore representing the prototype of all that we understand by the word 'man.' [[masturbation|He is the Prometheus of mankind from whose bright forehead the divine spark of genius has sprung]] at all times, forever [[poetry|kindling anew that fire of knowledge]] which [[Nickolaus|illumined the night of silent mysteries]] and thus caused man to climb the path to [[rape|mastery over the other beings of this earth]]. Exclude him and perhaps after a few thousand years darkness will again descend on the earth, human culture will pass, and the world turn to a desert.''
