An MP3 [[blog]] set up by some twee fatso failed A&R guy who seems to think that he's part of the music industry just because every now and then he violates the copyright of feeble twee indie bands.

Press journalists looking to do a story on the world of blogging often interview the [[basement dweller]] on account of him being easy to find.  Nine times out of ten, he'll be in his mom's basement, with that tenth time being at the [[cake shop]].

Great moments in [http://www.fluxblog.org Fluxblog] history would include him making a three year stand against corporatisation and homogeneity in music, and then begging for a job with MTV.com, and that one time he posted an MP3 that wasn't fey white-boy indie shit. (Psyche.  He's never done that.)

Fluxblog's creator is good friends with the myriad bunch of sex-offenders and basement dwellers that make up [[Pitchfork Media]]. Together, they like to pretend that members of New York indie bands are actually their friends, and don't treat them with the same contempt as they do [[Suicide Girls]] fiending for coke.
