'''Troll science''' or '''[[Trololo]]gy''' is a natural science concerned with the essential questions [[idiots|mankind]] has asked itself for ages. This new science was discovered [[last thursday]] in a dirty orgy involving [[Trollface]], clever [[trolls]], [[magnets]] and [[Xenu]]. These findings were documented in comic adventures featuring the classic character Trollface, taking part in clever experiments and inventing amazing inventions, with the help of miracles and magnets. Such experiments have led to amazing discoveries of methods of creating '''infinite energy''', infinite money, as well as successful human [[time travel]], among other things. It often features in [[4chan]] threads, often to the delight of the [[retarded]] inhabitants there, who will often believe they have stumbled upon a genius idea.
