Tom and Jerry
[[Image:Not_tom_and_jerry_and_wut.jpg|thumb|This is definitely not a picture of the famous cat and mouse! The colours are all wrong.]]
'''Tom and Jerry''' is the name of an [[at least 100 years ago|ancient]] [[American]] cartoon featuring a sadistic mouse (Jerry) and a stumbling [[Pussy|puss]] (Tom) as victim of the mouse. With a subsequent takeover by [[Hollywood]], the show's teensy-weensy doses of [[lulz]] vanished altogether.
Despite being an icon of [[furggotry|furries]] Tom and Jerry were not favoured by an article on the [[Wikia]]n slave [[furry]] site at the time this article was made. The short "Baby Puss" is known for turning a generation of child viewers into [[adult babies]].

==Popularity in East Asia==
Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse are immensely popular in [[Asia|the East, the Far East]], and particularly [[China]], where the good people get a special kick [[for great justice]] out of watching illegally copied DVDs of characters who should have been in the public domain by now anyway.


==Banhammer'd==
Due to the frequent occurrences of [[WTF|Tom and Jerry smoking]], [[Concerned Women]] across the UK shat bricks and decided that this is not at all suitable for kiddies to view. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2006/aug/22/health.smoking]

Also b& for tom's massive black person who appears in some of the episodes, also the number of times someone appears on screen in [[blackface]].
