Newfags can't triforce
[[Image:Jesuscantriforce.jpg|thumb|silly newfags]]

'''Newfags can't X''' are threads posted on [[4chan]] wherein the [[OP]] makes the claim that [[newfags]] can't do a certain thing like: 
*[[triforce]] 
*<font color=green>>green text</font>
*'''<span style="background-color: #66FF00"><font color="#0066ff">PENIS</font></span>'''
* #[[fortune]]
*uʍop ǝpısdn ǝdʎʇ
*Reverse post header
*impersonate [[moot]]
*[[Permaban|eval(]]
*'''<font color=red>Redname</font>'''
*blank post 

Most of the time these threads are flooded with idiots [[saging]] it to hell and back, either validating or discrediting OP's claim, since anyone who would post in these threads is an obvious [[faggot]]. Of course only newfags care about [[shit nobody cares about|posting those]], so it's usually an easy way to spot newfags and raging oldfags.

Or, preferably, [[ignore]] the entire thread. After all, you have [[fap|much better things to do]]. Though it may be a mark of pride in the [[basement dweller|basement-dwelling]] set to respond to such blatant idiocy with a perfectly-formed (or [[troll|intentionally misshapen]]) set of upwards-pointing triangles, most users are going to leave your post unnoticed while they continue to frantically seek out [[CP]].

==Google==
[[Image:Google triforce.jpg|thumb|right|Lol wut?]]

On april 22, 2009 the self aware system that is [[The Google|skynet]] trolled all of /b/ by hiding the triforce in its main theme photo. [[Some argue|Some speculated]] that a person who works with the Google told it that it couldnt do one and then it promptly proved him wrong.

[[4chan]] quickly categorized this as [[win]], but they soon realized that triforce is now a forced meme, so it eventually became a [[fail]].

==Final boss of newfaggotry==
Sometimes, threads pop up on /b/, claiming that this certain thread is the final boss of [[Internet|the internet's first level]], and whoever posts in the thread is no longer a newfag.

That is total [[bullshit]], however, therefore enjoy your [[Newfag|newfaggotry]], sir, because you will never become a [[Retard|true /b/rother]] :(.

==ED Newfags==
[[ED]] has it's certain newfaggotry as well. Symptoms may include being [[unfunny]], [[Amirite|asking whether the poster is right]], [[Writing Yourself Into An Article|namefagging]], spamming [[PA|pa]] bullshit, and creating [[retarded]] articles about [[Latvia|things nobody knows]], AMIRITE?

==Censorship==
[[Image:newfagtank.png|thumb|Real newfags are the ones that do this at all]]
On June 17, [[moot|moot]] censored the expression "[[cancer|Newfags can't triforce]]", confirmed on /b/, to [[chemo|cure the cancer]]. Trying to post [[cancer|it]] gives this error message : "Part of your comment isn't allowed to be posted :(". However this has not improved much of anything becasue of all the alternative ways to create Newfags can't X threads
