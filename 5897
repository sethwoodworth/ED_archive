OG Loc is an [[Uncyclopedia|un-meme]] that was started [[last Thursday]] when some faggot in /v/ posted a picture of the [[fail|failed]] rapper and notorious [[DOUBLE NIGGER|MULTI-NIGGER]] of the same name from the shitty vidya game [[Grand Theft Auto|Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]. The post announced to the world that OG Loc was now a meme. However, much like [[Milhouse]], Loc must have never filled out the paperwork required for memehood because people immediately started [[spam|shitposting]] that he was not a meme and quoting [[Shit nobody cares about|some of his most choice lines from the vidya]]. However, everyone had a fucking [[ADD|ADHD]] attack and nobody could keep a decent combo going so the post died in a cataclysm of [[Za Warudo|ZA OH JEE LOKUes]] and [[L-L-LUNAJACK!|L-L-LAZLOJACKs]]. It is also worth noting that OG stands for [[AZN|Oriental Gentleman]] and not [[Bix Nood|Original Gangsta]] when applied to Loc.

{{Q|Aug Lock? IT'S O-G LOC, YA HEAR ME PLAYA?!?}}

==Where The Hell IS Loc NOW???==

'''There are two possibilities:'''

1. He is hiding out in Nairobi with [[Weegee]]. This is the most likely because OG Loc is a black person and would blend right in. Since they are both failed characters, they have shit in common.

2. He is driving his Chevrolet movie theater (equipped with [[Interior Crocodile Alligator]] Technology) across the country. This is less likely because of his massive [[fail]] rating which makes it impossible for him to [[rape|purchase]] said vehicle or do the [[Barrel Roll|barrel rolls]] required to operate it.
