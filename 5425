'''The misleading thumbnail''' is an Internets technique related to the [[fat girl angle shot]] and often used by sufferers of [[Internet disease]].  Commonly used on dating sites by those not smart enough to [[photomanip]] or use pictures from 1992 when they were still thin, or had all their hair, the misleading thumbnail can lead to moments of shock when browsing sites like [[OKCupid]].  

The premise behind the misleading thumbnail is simple.  '''Anyone can look cute at 100x100.''' Perhaps she is just "pleasingly plump." Or: His profile says "Body type: Some extra baggage." Well, many of us could stand to lose 5 pounds, right? Not such a big deal. "Average" physique? Right, well we can't all expect to be [[Miss South Carolina]]. Fatties know that by simply cropping the sagging, pallid fleshrolls away, one can work wonders for initial desirability ... until the viewer clicks through to the "full size" image, or even meets up with [[IRL]].  So to speak.

==Misleading thumbnails in Wiki==
There exists a technique in MediaWiki which allows one to hide a less pleasant image behind a pleasant one. It is used in [[Template:Deceptiban]] to great effect. It's code is as follows:

<code><nowiki>[[Image:BlockContest.jpg|center|thumb=IS_IT_CAN_BE_HUGS_TIEM_NOW_PLEES_CAT.jpg|Click the kitten if you would like to appeal your ban.]]</nowiki></code>

The first image is a cunningly renamed (you can't hide the real image name) [[Pain Series]] image, and the second is the image which the user sees.
