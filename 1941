[http://www.twitter.com/shard_dax D-Malice] (aka [[Powerword|Jacob Ray Axe]], [[furry|SWFTWLF]], black person, [[otherkin|Shard-Life]], and of course [[fail|former]] [[Music Portal|Portal Czar]] and EDitor [[ShardDax]]) is yet another [[EDF]] meme/lulzcow, and everyone's [[gimp]]. With D-Malice, we have an [[ugly]] [[fat ass]] in [[denial]] with his [[gay|urges to make everything pink]] and [[Christian|belief in ghost stories]]. He's an [[unemployed]] [[redundant|Graphic Artist]], failed [[college]] twice ([[fact|and bound to fail this third time]]. <b>Update:</b> copped out and ended up getting an Associates Degree from a Community College), has a very [[no life|shitty life]] and makes [[Techno|terrible music]], yet he still believes [[USI|he's hot shit]]. He takes Internet insults VERY SERIOUSLY and has a habit of being the source of hate thread after hate thread on [[EDF]]. Fun fact, he has never passed up an opportunity to get ANGRY and HURT about what people say about him on the Internet.

==About D-Malice==

===Typical Reaction to one of his music videos===

 Anitude: WTF is he singing?
 Merf: He's rocking like an austitic 
 Cunt: I think he's singing "Don't cry for me Argentina"
 Marekatt: Cry for D-Malice instead
 Cunt: hahahahaha autism

|But anyway, yeah, I had tried to kinda drop most of those feelings about her a long time ago.

|Then, to make a long story short, we talked more often, my idiot friend started to half-stalk her online, some things happened between my conviction and my true feelings, and here I am again, still in love with her, maybe even more-so now. I don't know how to handle that part, but right now, things are going fine. I'm actually really happy with the way things are going between me and her, just maybe a little sad I don't see her as much online (I think my "friend" had something to do with that...)|So it's not only D-Malice that surrounds himself in [[AIDS|layers and players of gay]]

|Anyway, I'm debating making this into one of those "Culture" things, but we basically had it out tonight, again. Highlights include calling her an immature 13-year-old in an 18-year-old's body, her saying I was never good enough for her (she's now dating some 16-year-old that's totally "better" than me lol), and a lot of references to the fact she's a gold-digger.|Deciding to [[Rape|talk]] to [[Whore|an ex]] because he's such a [[Asshole|great guy]].

==[[social experiment|HAHAHA I TROLL U]]==
[[Image:Wakaisguylol.jpg|thumb|300px|[[lie|HOLY SHIT THE RESEMBLANCE IS UNCANNY!]]]]

After realizing everyone's laughing at him, he came up with this genius "open letter".

{{co|third|[HA!]|[Dearest EDF]|0|{{Quote|But srsly, [[Haters Make Me Famous|thanks for the h8]]. No really, I've said it before a few places, it's obv. the best way to get rid of something is to keep calling it out or baiting it with words like "butthurt" and "fat," 'cause that's totally what some of you Internets Superheroes seem to flame me for to GTFO or something. Here's the real kicker, deliberately being a USI jackoff who's knowingly pissed you off for pages upon pages of lame wankery, eventually having to attempt to end it myself to save yourselves the trouble (which it never seems to get through your LOL IMMA FLAME THE FUCK OUTTA FATTY drives), is what makes me LOL the hardest. Notice how I've never done anything to directly piss off the people that matter on both the forums and ED? Probably because they're not retards hellbent on being right or being "perfect" to a point of ruin and anti-lulz some of your have brought about.

But that's okay, I'm sure you'll understand someday, when you're still crying in a corner because your IRL turned out shittier than your OTI one.

Much love, forever and always|D-Malice TL;DR - [[Irony]] and [[BAW|BAAWWWWWWWWWWWW]]}}|background-color: white; padding: 4px;}}

D-Malice had off-handedly mentioned if gencdo did a [[Final Fantasty X|Lulu]] [[cosplay]] for Halloween, he'd do a Wakka one. Deciding it was [[shit nobody cares about|something mostly irrelevent]], he'd forgotten about it:

{{Quote|Not rly, I kind of do look like Wakka, if I tanned.|D-Malice}}

Turns out [[troll|someone]] did remember, and made this comparison of one fat-ass to [[weeaboo|another animated one]] shown on the right.

In forgetting it all, he wrote:

{{co|fourth|[Wat?]|[WAKKA-WAKKA]|0|{{Quote|I don't recall comparing myself literally to weeb characters, but if I did, I was probably referring to the fact I haven't had a natural hair-color since the beginning of the millennium, or drunk. Whatever. I've never denied being fat, just not as fat, and it was never a baw thread; I told the bitch she was a child and once told her to kill herself with razorblades I sent to her house, how is that crying over a failed relationship? Gay, haha, so many seem to be hoping for it, but it never happens. Would make more sense considering my taste in music and style, but I digress.

I'm glad you've read all my posts, I'm sure they were mighty fine reads considering I usually post on graveyard hours waxing poetic about how I must have killed one of your wives or a goat, but again digressing. Point here is, if you did write an article about me, I'd fact-check it for accuracy.

==I'm Kind Of A Big Deal==
[[File:A_Wild_LardDax.jpg|thumb|235px|A wild [[Pokemon|LardDax]] appears!]]
[[File:WHATDAFUCK_ED_LOL.jpg|thumb|235px|I WILL SAVEZ YOU EDS1!!! I WILL DELETE THIS PIKTURE FROM ERRYWHERE!!![[111]]]]
ShardDax was very upset over [[EDS1]]'s fall from grace. He believed that he personally had a hand in getting [[User:Lmte|Lmte]] and [[User:Habermann|Habermann]] [[b&]]. Therefore, he took it as a personal affront to his huge [[ass|ego]] when people began posting "free lmte" images in various places. [[rage|Enraged]], he went on a mission to delete each and every occurrence of this posting. Unfortunately for him, ShardDax never got the memo that deletion rampages are bad, and a form of [[vandalism]]. When he was caught edit warring with two other users over [[zomg|THAT VERY OFFENSIVE IMAGE]], he was [[b&]] for 3 whole days.

Then he thought it would be a good idea to come talk shit about his ban on IRC:
<br><b><%ShardDax> I was still gonna go deleting all I found 
<br><%ShardDax> Userpages, articles, etc.
<br><Pory-tan> lol
<br><%ShardDax> Meh alright then, have fun [[lolwut|supporting bad trolls]] and trying to get Lmte his job back.</b>

<br>So his 3 day ban turned into a one week ban. Then he talked some more shit.Which earned him a one month ban. Still clueless that '[[mod sass|talking shit = moar ban]]', he continued his bitchfest because banning him is the same as supporting the terrorists:
<br><b><ShardDax> A month, [[lie|for deleting spam on a page and removing something from my talk page]]? What the hell? [[BAWWWW|I have projects, articles in wait, A PORTAL...]]
<br><ShardDax> Nah, Subseven's mad I'm deleting spam, therefore I'm "edit warring" or something. He needs to just fuck Icky and stop crying.</b>

<br>This was strike three but onoes how will ED survive without him? Well it did and by the end of it he had talked himself into a year. [[Goodnight sweet prince]]. Even still he tweets away his angst, convinced that ED cannot get along without him and his Music Portal edits.

<br><b>ShardDax: Subseven, still reading my Twitter? Count how many Music EDitors ED has now? Was it still wise you banned me for reverting a spammer?</b> 
<br>(ShardDax learning absolutely nothing from [[EDS1]])

<br>Eventually his ban was lessened to a week, but not before he issued this hilarious ultimatum:
<br><b>[01:54:49] <ShardDax> If sherrod doesn't work this out
<br>[01:55:02] <ShardDax> [[ragequit|I'm not coming back]]
<br>[01:55:12] <ShardDax> [[done with ED|And ED is completely cut from my record]]</b> 
<br>(ShardDax threatening to break it off with ED forever if Sherrod doesn't do what he wants]]}}
