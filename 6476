Podcasting
[[Image:Maddox irl.jpg|thumb|Attitude of most podcasters.]]

'''Podcasting''' is a techno-catchphrase invented by the corporate whores at [[Apple]] to [[rape|bugger]] you into buying a brand new, sleek, super-sexy [[iPod]] for the low, low price of only 300 [[money|dollars]]. Podcasts are small radio-esque [[MP3|audio files]] that you download to your iPod, and are only used to take up space as they will never get listened to.<br/>Podcasts purport to discuss any number of topics, though nobody knows for sure because nobody ever listens to them. Topics include things like enormous [[fat]] women in [[tubgirl|bath tubs spraying shit all over themselves]], [[goatse|men with horrifically stretched anuses]], and [[Caturday|unbearably cute/cheerful feline animals]]. Some people also make podcasts pertaining to [[shit nobody cares about|news, games, technology, and religion]], among [[at least 100|many other topics]], but such things haven't really caught on so far.

==Podcasting in Two Simple Steps==
Podcasts are extremely simple to create and distribute. The procedure is so simple that [[some argue]] why it needs to be defined with its own word.
#Record yourself talking about either a favourite or controversial subject. Inviting guests is optional.
#Upload it somewhere to the Internet.
