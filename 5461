'''Moid.org''' is a [[website]] where anybody can upload pictures of anything on its /ed in the dropbox (limit of [[over 9000]] uploads per 24 hours). It was intended for pictures such as [[goatse]], [[bestiality]] porn, mutilation, murder, [[Pain]], etc... After a while though, [[people]] uploaded all sorts of [[shit]] and used it as both a new [[photobucket]] aund a new [[12chan]]. 

There was a brief time in which [[OVER 9000]] [[shoop da whoop]] images were uploaded, but [[lulz]]-killers complained. There was also a [[forum]] for spambots, and [[retards|lurkers]]. Then, [[last Thursday]], MOID suddenly disappeared then unfortunately re-appeared. There are a few [[conspiracy]] theories as to why MOID died but [[Shit nobody cares about| nobody knows the truth/gives a fuck]]. Moid is alive again but the [[faggotry]] still remains, the site is now dominated by [[lulz]]-killers and lurkers posting shitty generic [[porn]] and [[old memes]]. 

==Admins==
One of the reasons for MOID's epic shittitude is that it's administrator doesn't give a shit. After it's second resurrection, the administrator added a report button with caption "admin plz". Of course it didn't do jack shit, except giving the users a feeling that there's someone behind that shit, but truth be told, he doesn't give half a fuck about the few lurkers actually present on the shitty forum. There is now a shitty system where [[13 year old boys]] and other [[retards]] can rate their [[Google]] [[porn]] up and rate the [[shit]] the site was made for down. Without notice, Moid died yet again on the 6th of July 2010 with a single photo of a party van left on the site, leading most dwellers of the site to shit buckets fearing Moid was in trouble. A short while later the beloved admin proved his loyalty and commitment to the site, by putting the domain up for sale. Of course no dweller of Moid could meet his utterly fair and reasonable price so the domain and Moid disappeared forever.
