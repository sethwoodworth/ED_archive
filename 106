<s>The xChan Directory Dumper</s> '''4olderDump'''  is a nifty piece of python witchcraft that makes it easy for you, [[Anonymous]], to dump (hence the name) an entire directory of your [[porn]] or other images into a thread on 4chan. The software runs on Python and requires [http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/ pycurl] to run. You would use this in place of other shit, when you are running on [[Linux]] or you don't feel like running exe's downloaded off an anonymous image board.

'''EXPERT PROGRAMMERS''' will use curl on jewnix, and type in something like: ''for i in *jpg; do curl -F board=b -F replythread=1177 -F message="MASSIVE DUMP" -F imagefile=@$i www.54chan.org/board.php; sleep 3; done''
