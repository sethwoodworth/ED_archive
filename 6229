{{spoilers|PAGANISM IS NOT ACTUALLY A RELIGION!}}

<center>'''DISCLAIMER:'''

'''Pagan''' is a word describing [[religion]], not a religion itself. However, "Pagans" don't realize this and go on to claim things that have all the individualism of saying "I'm polytheistic."

Pagans believe that the Earth is alive in the form of a God and Goddess. They can trace their religion's roots back to their ancestors in the 1960s, who basically made up a load of shit about what they imagined druids to be like then called themselves pagans. In a way, they were an early form of otherkin (note that pagans and [[otherkin]] continue to influence each other to this very day - otherkin most often describe their [[cult|religion]] as "pagan"). [[Truth|They also believe it's their godgiven right to be complete assholes, rivaling vegans and flip flop wearing 20 somethings for levels of sheer douchebaggery.]]


==Beliefs==
According to their religion, each year is a cycle. The God dies on a date known as Samhain (pronounced "Dan-Zig") which is coincidentally on Halloween. He is reborn again each year on a date known as Yule which, coincidentally (?), is on Christmas. If you mention any of these coincidences to a Pagan, they will <strike>cast a voodoo curse on you</strike> light a [[satanist|black candle]] and [[magick|think evil thoughts]] about you, so watch out! 

There's a simple explanation for that, which too many idiotic [[4chan|4chaners]] are too lazy to go find out for themselves. (HINT: It's because it's fucking fake.)

There are other holidays that tell the story of the God and the Goddess, but they are far too boring to write about. These are the basics of the mythology of the circle of life that fuels the many branches of Paganism. That, and copious amounts of [[Disney]] &mdash; which explains why the Baptists have boycotted them.

People who believe they are Pagan for the purpose of attention-whoring usually have a hyper-inflated superiority complex, [[E-go|especially if they are protected by the unbreakable barrier of a computer screen and thousands of miles.]]  They believe they are more sensitive to beings of the next dimension (particularly ghosts and demons), and frequently say things like "I'm feeling a strange aura from that side of the room.", if they haven't been getting enough attention in a conversation.  They will make [[retards|gullible people]] shiver and shake, despite the person being told there's something there knowing that there is nothing there.

Pagans revel in claiming to believe in many religious doctrines, which "coincidentally" are always obscure, nature-based, and require donning ridiculous clothing to be worshipped. Pagans are not at all deterred by the fact that most of these religious doctrines grossly contradict each other; most likely because they know absolutely fucking nothing about the dogma they supposedly embrace (see [[Buddhism]]). For example, most pagans claim to worship Dana, Hecate, and Odin. These gods are all from different religions, and all of these religions contradict each other. The pagan claims to worship them because they are vaguely associated with birth, magic and wisdom respectively (worshipping in this context meaning "using their names when the pagan feels he or she is not getting enough attention"). 

===[[Wicca]]: Pagan Light with Cherry===

[[Image:Wildwildwest.jpg|thumb|right|Wicca wicca wild wild west.]]

Like [[goth]]s, but eco-friendly and politically correct, Wicca is something taken up by [[fat]] [[16 year old girls]] so they can call themselves [[witch]]es because they think it'll freak people out (though it is their immense size and ugliness that actually freaks people out, but they'd rather belief in a big-horned, big-penised god running around with faeries than facing that simple fact). Many guys claim to respect this, but this is because they are [[neckbeard]]s with no hope of ever getting sex from anyone else ever.

On LJ, [[Wiccans]] are represented by {{ljcomm|user=wiccan}}, moderated by the always rational [[Silvertree]]. Wicca attracts many morbidly obese girls and [[women]] because of their slimming dark-colored robes and their hatred of men, leading to lots of awkward lesbian sex in the name of "celebrating the sacred feminine".

It is also well known that Wiccans like to form smaller groups that they like to call [[gang|covens]]. These smaller groups tend to meet on full moons, half moons, and new moons, but not on on blue moons, because blue moons aren't real (just like <strike>their</strike> <strike>all</strike> <strike>THEIR</strike> ALL religion!). On the occasion of new moons one member of the [[cult|coven]] is nominated to bend over and show their moon, and every one else takes turns [[buttsex|drawing down the moon]] with their [[penis|wands]].

Wiccans like to give themselves really [[retarded|clever and interesting]] names, such as Princess Snowdrop of the Divine Light of Ass Hats, Crystal Raven with a chance of Light Scattered Showers, and Part-lee sunny outside. A lot of the time these names are simply taken from the first two to three things they see after dropping a tab of [[LSD]], or alternatively [http://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/humor/moondrip.html|with the help of a mentor]. 

Wiccans also love to sacrifice [[virgins]] to the [[Satan|Horned God]]. In fact, if you live in a small town that has a [[harem|coven]] in it, you might as well forget your dreams of ever getting any virgin [[pussy]]. (This is true even if you live in a town with no Wiccans in it, because all women are [[sluts]].)

Lastly, Wiccans do indeed worship Satan, but they do this behind closed doors. If you accuse Wiccans of worshipping Satan, they will [[batshit|flip the fuck out]] because you've discovered their dirty little secret.

===Neo-Paganism===
Essentially, Neo-Paganism combines all of the most [[nerd]]y elements of classical (and mutually antagonistic) European and Middle Eastern pagan pantheons, while leaving out most of the [[cool]] stuff like human and animal sacrifice so that 30-year-old [[basement dweller]]s can secretly take up witchcraft without too many of their secular or Jew-[[Christian]] peers batting an eyelash. In reality, they practice Wicca in order to fuck [[16-year-old girl]]s (see above).

Most Neo-Pagans are [[goths]] who never grew out of gothdom, work shitty service-sector jobs, deem themselves "[[nerd|intellectuals]]," and sit around playing [[dungeons and dragons|''D&D'']] while whacked out of their skulls on whatever's at hand. Pagans like [[Hrafnagardh]] and [[Weofodthignen]], who like to wear horned helmets and pretend to be [[viking]]s, are called "Asatruar", which is an ancient Norse word for "white supremacists".

===Stag Circle===

[[Image:morningwood.jpg|thumb|SUMMON MOAR MORNING WOOD!]]

Even more [[Retard|Occulticly]] than regular pagans are the [http://www.dolmengrove.co.uk Dolmen Grove]. Proud, baby-eating Satanists who wear those retarded Snuggie blankets and raise their arms in the general direction of the sun, and take authoritative stances on issues that nobody cares about. Most recently have sent an open letter to Extreme-Islamic Hate Preacher Dr Rowan Williams, exclaiming their disgust at the suggestion of integrating elements of Religious Law into British Law, but tragically falling short of demanding the repeal of all British laws which have elements of Religious inspiration therein.

Unlike [[Scientology]], this lolicult offers its own [http://www.dolmengrove.co.uk/Studycourses.htm indoctrinate-at-home], study courses at no monetary cost. The cost is of course at the expense of the recipient's dignity. There is no leader, but there is a lead-camwhore who is frequently seen wearing twigs on his head to summon even greater morning wood. See [[The Dolmen|The Dolmen article]] for moar!

[[Image:Wickerman-pagans.jpg|thumb|right|Do they let the fact that Stonehenge was never even a religious site deter them? If only.]]

This beautiful, life-affirming narrative seems to attract [[cutter]]s and [[angsty teen]]s the world over. Like atheists, pagans are pissed off at the STUPID XTIANS who made fun of them in high school, so they're looking to reject the establishment like the hardcore rebels they are. Unlike atheists, though, pagans are secretly too afraid that Jehovah might actually exist to totally give him the finger, so they put him in a dress and call him "The Goddess", hoping that if that whole Jesus thing is actually true they might get a pass into Heaven anyway because hey, at least they worshiped ''something''. Because of this, most pagans behave exactly like Christians, except for not knowing when to keep their damn clothes on, substituting a spiritual relationship with Christ for virulent sexual relationships with each other.

Like Cosmic Jew-Zombie worshipers, they come in a variety of flavors that most people fail to recognize. This causes much butt-hurt, and they will then rant and rave about the minuscule differences that make them all such [[fags|unique]] individuals. And of course, none of these idiots realize that "Pagan" is not actually a religion, but an adjective describing religions with cool gods like the Greeks and Egyptians had.

If you encounter pagans on the Internet, you may think that they are all batshit insane. This is not entirely true, since at least 50% of pagans on the Internet are actually [[Son of Art]]. This gives the community a worse reputation than it would have otherwise.

The LJ [[community]]: {{ljcomm|user=pagan}}

[[Image:Pagan.jpg|thumb|240px|Right|According to [[Google]], this is what a pagan looks like. Sickly little fellow, ain't he?]]

===Practices===
A little-known fact is that pagans were actually the first [[furries]]. [[Animal abuse|Animal sacrifices]] are also common among pagans who skin the animal while it's still alive and grind it's horns to make penis-enlargement potions.

When not [[fapping|listening]] to the bleats of a dying goat, pagan make potions out of [[drugs|wild plants]] that can make people fall in [[sex|love]], tell the truth or run around naked with their genitals flapping in the wind (thus associating them with [[bakedfurs]]).

Because of their strong belief with the cycle of the year, pagans - like most angsty teens - are obsessed with sex. Teen [[pregnancy]] is simply not an issue for them. Despite their best effort to breed like their rabbit gods, pagans are still relatively rare [[IRL]] because today no person in their right mind would want to pay taxes for some little whore who thinks getting high and letting her dog do things to her [[pussy]] is part of her spirituality.

Because at the end of the day they are all animal-fucking doped-up cannibals, pagans have often been mistaken for [[Satanism|Satanists]]. Although "mistaken" is not quite the correct word as they are exactly the fucking same anyways.



==How to piss off pagans==

*When Pagans tell you their people are stronger because they fight with he spirit of vikings and barbarians of Celtic times. tell them Roman Emperor Constantine The Great, used his mighty Christian powers to rain holy hell on Pagans [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Milvian_Bridge at the batlle of Milvan Bridge]. Thus making them pussies

*Tell them most of the religions they worship, forbade them from worshiping other gods but the ones they are already worshiping.

*Tell them that [[Christ]] is older than Paganism.

*Insist they worship [[Satan]].

*Be sure to rearrenge and organize their altars! The altars are usually a damn mess...

*Play card games with their [[Magic|Tarot]] deck.

==The Media==
<big><b>Da Vinci Code</b></big>
Due to the fact that there are [[at least 100 years ago|at least 100]] documentaries about every element of [[Dan Brown]]'s [[crap|exciting]] [[Old meme|new]] [[shit nobody cares about|book]], there are now many documentaries made about Paganism. These feature just over an hour of [[bestiality|big men fucking animals]] with commentary from [[dumb|recognized]] [[Google|researchers]] about how [[we]] are all the same as the Pagans.


<big><b>The Wicker Man</b></big>
The Wicker man was originally a [[winrar|win]] [[British]] horror movie accurately depicting the lives of real pagans - a [[Christian]] is brought to their island and after much mind-fucking is eventually burned alive by [[Lord of the Rings|Christopher Lee]]. Oddly this caused more [[butthurt|outrage]] amongst pseudo-witches than actual [[Christians]]. ''The Wicker Man'' was eventually re-made with Nicholas Cage, and was deemed a pile of [[shit]] by everyone.

==SPECIAL MENTION: Nazi Pagans==
As [[christfags]] and [[atheists]] battle over who was to blame for inventing [[Nazism]], other white supremacists happily confuse and piss off both parties by converting to paganism (specifically Odinism). Why? [[Some say]] it is because [[Christianity]] is descended for [[Judaism]] and therefore is not suited to white nationalists. Others think it is because it teaches all races are equal. It is most commonly believed however that pagans are naturally bloodthirsty and racist and so perfectly fitted with neo-[[Nazism]].
