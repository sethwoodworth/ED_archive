'''Patachu''', also known as ''[[moonspeak|パタチュー]]'' and ''[[tripcode|PATACHU666#LULZISTwQI]],'' is a notorious [[french]] nationalist sympathizer, doubled of an unoriginal ripoff of [[cwc|Chris-chan's]] [[sonichu]] mixed with some kind of [[digimon|patamon]], resulting in a creepy [[digimon]]-looking [[troll]]. He quotes from [[Nietzsche]] and laughs insanely everytime he accomplishes something, if ever.


==Origins and Purpose==
[[Image:Patachu paperchild.jpg|thumbnail|left|Leave my Patachu alone!]][[Image:FN.PNG|thumbnail|Note the french nationalist posters on background]]
Patachu originates from a [[hentai]]-related Ezboard. A [[French]] 20yo female [[deviantart|tartlet]] cartoonist and a [[japan|japanese]] [[manga|mangaka]] both eventually claimed [[copyright|ownership]] of said character, until one day some [[furry]] drew porn of it and as a result introduced a new [[fetish]] to the furry fandom: [[Mangina|cuntboys]].<br/>Patachu was originally asexual though, so it was bound to happen.

==Active Principles==
[[Image:You_are_manipulated.png|thumbnail|Trolling in action.]]
Patachu is a 13yo, intersex [[islam|mudjahedin]] [[What|mokvwap]] [[digimon|d-reaper warrior]], and [[pretty cool guy|doesn't afraid of anything]]. Though he has assimilated with [[furries]] and [[weeaboos]], Patachu hates them with a passion, explaining his motives behind spending so much time trolling them on the Internet. He is also prone to [[Ad_hominem|endless debates]], gathering [[rage]], getting banned, and invoking the holy powers of [[drama]] in a miserable attempt to extract some tears of potential [[lulz]]. 

Patachu also posts frequently on [[4chan]]'s /[[g/]], /[[k/]] and /[[r9k/]] boards, and usually [[Drawwhore|illustrates]] his posts with [[Gay|cute]] [[MS Paint]] drawings. Sometimes he eventually derails the thread with logical fallacies, [[raid]] suggestions, and [[loli]] hentai. He may be also spotted on various other imageboards.

Bad news for you if you're a fan of this guy or whoever it is : Patachu's MPD is explained by the fact there's more than one person posting as **Patachu#LULZISTwQI**, now you know why he often gets [[banned]] for posting furry porn on a clean board, yet still posting and mocking mods for "not banning him hard enough". He even released a complete page of tripcodes including his own.

==Accomplishments==

===Wildwulf===
(aka Brandon Vongthongthrip), a notorious [[zoophile]], posted a message on Patachu's [[furaffinity|shoutbox]] saying "Zoophilia for the win". Patachu raged, then made public Wildwulf's identity and [[dox|all he could find about him]], including the most embarasing photos on both [[lulz.net]] and [[4chan]]'s /[[b/]]. [[Bestiality]] being against the [[law]] where Wildwulf resides, Wildwulf ended up in [[prison]]. [[Anonymous]] raved and  [[Whiteknight|Patachu fapped to his lawful accomplishment]]. However, [[some argue|rumors say]] that the whole event was in fact orchestrated by a crew of trolls; as Wildwulf being already charged for domestic abuse.

===Trolling Furries===
Getting permabanned on [[FurAffinity]] for [[http://dl.free.fr/f1P14WueO drawing]] the site's owner and notorious douchebag [[Dragoneer]], beheaded by another douchebag, [[Allan]]. Drawing the said thing not being against the site's Terms of Submission, he could get away with it, but Patachu successfully angered [[Dragoneer], discovering it at his Anthrocon desk. He banned Patachu like the fist of an angry god. Fursonas are [[srs bsns]] on [[Furaffinity]]!

===[[Trolls trolling trolls]]===
Getting banned from [[lulz.net]] for flooding the board with [[guro]] without a [[proxy]], being french and surrendering IRL, the only thing he can do to compensate is to flood random boards the said way every time there's something he dislike.

===Victoria's Secret===
With the help of many furfags and weeaboos from /r9k/ and proxies to vote up, Patachu managed to enter into some ''Victoria's Secret'' contest, despite being a drawing.

===[[shit|Art!]]===
Mastering mspaint, all the rest you could find about Patachu is either [[fanart]] or Jew by some greedy Tartlet.

===Digimon Activism===
[[Image:Shin0r0z-Patachu-Rape.jpg|thumb|right|Rule#34 is mandatory]]
Trolling [[4Chan]]'s new [[pokemon|/vp/]] board by spamming [[Furry]] shit everywhere, essentially [[digimon|Renamon]] raping a poor [[pikachu]].
