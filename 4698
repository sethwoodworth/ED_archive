LOLCode
{{programming}}

Useless, don't bother with it, but if you're that retarded to use this all 10 or so actual commands are on lolcode.com.

If you really wanna know, it's based on LOLCATS. a "Hello world" of this would be:

<pre>
HAI
CAN HAS STUDIO?
VISIBLE "Hello World, this programming language sucks ass"
KTHXBAI
</pre>


Really, its not as bad as you might think, its useless in that it is exactly like [[C]] with the syntax changed around.
