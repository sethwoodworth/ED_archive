Retro Video Game Kids

A plague is sweeping our beloved [[Internet]]; the plague of the '''Retro Video Game Kid'''. Just like [[video game reviewers]], Retro Video Game Kids ''(short: RVGKs)'' are a new mutation of the [[GRIDS|AIDS]] that is killing [[YouTube]]. RVGKs are little more than [[shota|young autistic children]] who love collecting ''(Not to be confused with actually playing them)'' [[Retro|old video games]] - not for the sake of [[Nostalgia|sharing memories]] ''(which is quite obvious since they weren't shat out of their mother's [[Tentacle rape|crusty vagina]] before games like [[AVGN|MC Kids]] were released)'' but for the sake of being [[cool]]. That, and their families are too poor to afford [[Halo|Halo 3]], so they fob them off with [[SNES|20 year old shit]] from garage sales. 

However, [[you]] should note that they're <s>probably</s> [[You|bullied and beaten at school]] because they're [[You|fat loners with no lives]]. And what happens when [[4chan|fat loners with no life discover the Internet and share the same interests in a close circlejerk]]? A new shitty Internet subculture is born.

==How to Identify a Retro Video Game Kid==
Retro Video Game Kids have a lot in common and randomly discovering one of them on YouTube is [[X? in my Y?|more likely than you think]]. But instead of [[TL;DR|delivering a five-paragraph long pamphlet about the characteristics these people like to share]] which [[you]] won't care to read anyway, our [[CSIII|top scientists]] summed them up and created a [[Bingo]] card, thus making [[sociology]] more comical. [[Goatse|Fun for the whole family!]]

[[Image:RVGKbingo.jpg|center|500px]]

==Major Players==
Much like in video games, there are certain characters in the RVGK [[cult]] who stand out above the others, whether it's because their stats are higher than others ''(They own more shitty [[retro]] games)'' or because they manage to maintain a larger adventuring party ''(They have more [[retarded]] subscribers)''. Whatever the case may be, they have earned their spots on this list, for your [[masturbation|reading pleasure]].

[[Image:Macks_backer.jpg|thumb|right|Max Baker in 2010]]

'''Max Baker''', a young autistic obnoxious boastful [[USI|self-important faggot]], is the person responsible for the whole [[Anonymous|movement]].

He ''(and the movement itself)'' gained attention when [http://metokur.blip.tv/file/3569716/ NintendosAdvocate2], an [[Chris-Chan|obese and insecure sexist gaming manchild who leeches off the government and spends his SSI money on video games]], closed his account after a [[YouTube Commentaries#METOKUR|group of YouTube trolls]] called him out on his bullshit. Being one of NintendosAdvocate2's most obsessesive [[fanboys]], ''("He liked to collect crappy old [[retro]] games just like me! OMG HE IS MY IDOL!!11")'' Max Baker threw a shitfit of epic proportions, posting harsh comments on the troll's channel such as these:

{{quote|come on! leave youtube!|Max|fully unleashing his fury.}}
{{quote|how do you have sex with your penis?|Max|displaying that he skipped Sex Ed at school}}
{{quote|(insert ASCII art of four middle fingers here)|Max|being [[Autistic|artistic]].}}

These comments intrigued the trolls and other assorted onlookers, and prompted them to take a look at Max's channel. And so, the sick subcultural mess that is the Retro Video Game Kid [[emo|scene]] was discovered. He [[DELETE_FUCKING_EVERYTHING|deleted all his YouTube videos]] ''(possibly at the request of his parents)'' after he was trolled for several months, including a number of prank calls to his parents and his school.

[[troll|Internet archaeologists]] tried to enshrine some precious snippets of his [[Pain|angelic voice]] and [[smug|smug fucking face]], from his few surviving videos they had saved on their hard drives ''(Which they had used to produce a number of parody videos)''. Then, they realized that [[lol|he forgot to delete his videos on his second account]], which made things much easier.

Well, that's '''Brent Strong''' - the lovechild of Max Baker's autism and [[Alexander4488]]'s [[USI|ego]]. Brent may look [[gay|harmless]], but BE WARNED: If you [[troll|annoy]] him or [[troll|criticize]] his video series called the "[[LSD|Brent Strong Experience]]", he will [http://www.viddler.com/explore/METOKUR/videos/136/ respond to you] in the same way all other [[Chris-chan|self-bloated autistic faggots]] respond to negativity:

Once you feel the Brent Strong Experiance you turn Brentally Challenged just ask Marlon he was the worst to feel the Brent Strong Experiance.

Dayum, Brent, that sure was a diss! But hold on: Brent is so [[pussy|badass]] that he bothers to create a [[Tl;dw|FOURTEEN MINUTES LONG]] rant on why [[dumb|he hates being taught]].

'''Reny [[Mexico|Carrillo]]''' is a fat, under aged beaner, and a filthy [[attention whore]]. He is responsible for a game reviewing series by the name of {{youtube2|ther3trovideogamekid|The Retro Video Game Kid}}. [[Angry Video Game Nerd|Sound familiar]]?

<video type="vimeo" id="11699606" width="425" height="480" position="center"/>

Unfortunately ''(for him)'', [[YouTube Commentaries#METOKUR|that same aforementioned group of YouTube trolls]] discovered his reviews and did what they do best: [[Trolling|They exploited his weakness for their own amusement]]. Then, Reny revealed himself to be a potential [[lolcow]] by his way of responding. Instead of creating shitty [[anti-troll]] videos or [[Internet petition|e-petitions]], he decided to post something along the lines of "[[i told u i was hardcore]]", and continued hinting at his upcoming [[an_hero|suicide]]. Shocked by the plans of such a young Mexican fellow, [[Internet Humanitarianism|Internet Humanitarians]] tried to convince him that suicide is not a solution. Of course, the aforementioned suicide [[pussy|never happened]], and everyone realized that Reny is just a pathological liar and an [[Attention whore|attention whoring dumbass]].

The following video by Reny is another example of [[Gay|how close the RVGK circlejerk]] really is: They actually [[Mail|send]] fucking retro game [[Modern Warfare 2|care packages]] to each other.

Before it was known that he was a [[furfag]] with a [[vore]] [[fetish]], '''[[Ulrichthehedgehog]]''' (AKA [http://pastebin.com/f4f56263d Connor McCoy]) appeared to simply be an average, young, [[autistic]] male, who just so happened to review retro video games on his {{youtube2|Ulrichthehedgehog|YouTube channel}}. In fact, it was a commentary by [[YouTube Commentaries#METOKUR|those lovable aforementioned YouTube trolls]] over his review of the [[NES]] [[Gun|Zapper]] that got the [[Katamari Damacy|ball rolling]].

[[Image:Lorenzo IRL.jpg|thumb|right|Lorenzo IRL]]
'''Lorenzo Parker''' is a black person 17-year-old [[Autistic|retarded]] RVGK [[Furfag|Furry]] [[Plushie|Plushfag]] in denial, who attempts to [[Fail|troll]] the other RVGKs so that that he will not be [[pussy|trolled]]. In the past, Lorenzo's YouTube videos consisted of him making [[Video Game Reviewers|video game reviews]] with the help of his [[Sonic|Sonic]], [[Pokemon|Pokemon]], and [[Mario|Mario]] plushies. More recently, his videos have been nothing but gameplay of his shitty Game Maker games, which he will usually [[Delete fucking everything|remove]] within several hours.

He made a very [[Autistic|creative]] game about the RVGK's, it was really [[Shit|shitty]] and he [[Butthurt|forgot]] to add him self.

This {{youtube2|LorenzoTheComicFan|troll channel}} made Lorenzo close his channel, He even made a video of him closing his channel. View it [http://www.livevideo.com/video/9DCFB7BE77AF4B5088338D6D8C87D7E4/me-closing-my-youtube-account.aspx here]

Look at Lorenzo [[Crying|complaining]] on the google [[Nope|help]] forums about people re-uploading his camcorder videos. [http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=45d6978102d07f4c&hl=en Check it out, it's pretty funny.]

==Forgettable Characters==
As long as we're sticking with [[lame]] [[video game]] [[Analogy|analogies]], these following characters are sort of like the [[NPC|NPCs]] in [[RPG|RPGs]] who pace back and forth in the same 6 spaces on the [[GRID|grid]], praying that someone, ''ANYONE'', will notice them, if only for a precious second in time, and validate their very existence by asking them for their input. Having dispensed whatever [[Shit nobody cares about|useless information]] it is they have to offer, the main player walks away and never bothers talking to them again. Yeah: That just about sums up these next few kids pretty much perfectly.

Proof that all of these kids are entirely interchangeable with one another ''(Other than their personal reactions to being trolled, of course)''. These two guys are [[Buttsex|put together]] into a section because they are prime examples of a RVGK profile: Atrocious channel backgrounds, the use of [[Windows Movie Maker]], long fucking usernames which reek of [[weeaboo]] and [[autism]], and of course; shitty retro video game videos. They also get a special mention here because are close friends / [[Polygamy|"followers"]] of Max Baker - [[Troll|mess with them]] and you're [[Troll|messing with Max]].

Every clique has its members that happen to fall beautifully into other stereotypes. '''Graftwins3''' just so happens to be the [[emo|angsty emo metal teenager]] of the RVGK [[cult]].

His [[Shit|interesting and so alternative taste of music]] includes such bands like [[Black_metal|Pantera, "Canibal corpse"]] [[Sic|[sic]]], [[Juggalo|"insane clown posse"]] [[Sic|[sic]]], and [[Fag|"red hot chili peppers"]] [[Sic|[ffs, fucking sic]]] ''(He also enjoys "comedy's" films, and [[Gay|long walks on the beach]])''. He also advertises his favorite book as being [[The Bible]]. Pantera and The Bible? Such an "ironic" combination of these affiliations can only lead to the conclusion that he is actually a [[hipster]].

Unfortunately for [[Trolls|us]], he doesn't look like one ''(though he fits into the "[[obese]] [[nerd]]" look well enough)'', so we only have his lack of good taste to mock ''(and the aforementioned fact that he is an [[obese]] [[nerd]])''. And, you know, [[ALL_CAPS|THE FACT HE'S COLLECTING GAMES HE DOESN'T EVEN PLAY, JUST SO HE CAN BRAG ABOUT OWNING THEM]].

'''Nahtanoj1997''' is the perfect example of something that researchers refer to as the ''Second Generation of Retro Video Game Kids'': [[ripoff|Inspired]] by people like Max Baker, they go off to [[Video_Game_Reviewer|create their own review videos which almost completely differ from their idols' videos]], but still have one very important thing in common: [[Video_Game_Reviewer|They suck donkey balls]]. Such is the case with Jonathan: He created a game review series called the "[[Game Dude|Game Critic]]", which is even more "radiculous" than some of the average RVGK's videos. After [[YouTube Commentaries#METOKUR|the YouTube channel responsible for pretty much all the trolling so far on this article]] released a [[Let's play with YouTube|commentary]] of one of his reviews, they [[it is a mystery|mysteriously]] [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|disappeared]] - except for a saved review and, of course, the commentary.

=== James/[[JEBBUIT|20O4|Jebbuit]] ===

James is the first redneck ginger RVGK to join the internet.He has been memorised for having buttsex with Chubbychangz with NES while he drinks Drug Endosed water which he enjoyz. He has been seen with PopiBROS1 and other RVGKs like Dante Snifitdurd.When James buys a NES game that dosn't boot what does he do he makes a wut face for about 2 minutes then throws it away so no one sees that he spent $40.00 on a game that possibly works.Later on James found his soul mate a boy named Chase which he fell in love with, chase and james disscussed computers then met up in Atlanta City bought a computer with 8gb of ram from a boy names david and had crazy buttsex with it.

Being a filthy [[camwhore]] Unfortunately, he can not control his inner aspie, and does the same generic video game reviews as his peers as well.

Perhaps his most distinguishing feature is his admitted addiction to [[Weed|smoking the spinach]], which he seems to openly brag about on his channel and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPgIcKV4cgw in his channel comments]''(What a fucking [[attention whore]])''. Someone should give the kids mommy and daddy a [[Prank Call|call]], assuming they weren't the burnt-out shells who got him hooked in the first place. 

He recently discovered his section on this article, and responded with a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33eQKeDXodc terrible video] containing shitty YouTube Poop references, further demonstrating his desperate need for attention and his lack of [[shame]]. 

Just weeks after this article was written, Popi privates his [[fail|popiBROS1]] channel (due to him being [[butthurt]] about this article) and becomes a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railfan trainfag] on his new account [http://www.youtube.com/thesouthernpacific TheSouthernPacific]. Currently, he is in denial about collecting retro games, although he still browses a RVGK website called [http://www.famicomworld.com Famicomworld] and popiBROS1 still buys retro games from all the [[pedophiles]] of the retro gaming community.

==Trolling==
Trolling the RVGKs is so easy that it's almost [[depressing]]. If you want to find more information about your [[Nuke|chosen target]], just check his channel's comments.

[[Image:RVGKcommunication.png|center|700px]]

These comments are neither part of a conversation, nor are they cut out from other conversations - these people actually have the compulsive need to randomly share facts about themselves on other peoples YouTube channels. Who the fuck needs [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] search when targets are willing to post their own docs right there on their YouTube channel, for the rest of the Internet to see?

Once you've started [[trolling]], the [[lulz]] will lave like [[Cum|milk and honey]]. All it takes is a single mildly insulting comment, and the RVGKs will congregate on your channel, creating [[pathetic]] videos about you to the tune of these:

Of course, that's really all they ''CAN'' do: They're incapable of taking things any further than half-hearted call-outs in [[Windows Movie Maker]], set to the same shitty [[chiptunes]] they have on their [[iPod]].The kids also try to [[ED101|EDit]] this article, and write about people who [[RVGK#Fail_Trolls|troll]] them in an attempt to [[fail|counter-troll]]  the [[Ediots]] who wrote this article.However, true to their diagnosis of [[autism]], they will continue to post these videos, as ineffective as they are, honestly believing that they have some effect. [[You]], however, should know better than them, and will automatically feel superior to the Retro Video Game Kids, regardless of you wanting it or not.

Because trolling these kids is so easy, [[Bill Nye|our top ED science monkeys]] expect trolling in this sector to be [[Game_Dude#Continued_Trolling|done to death soon by attention seeking children who want to be on ED themselves]]. So, go ahead and [[rape|do with them whatever you please]], but get out of there before the underage copycats come and convince themselves that they are [[Fail|"epic win"]].

==Fail Trolls==
==='''Chase / JEBBUTT / [[Shit Nobody Cares About]]'''===
Chase is a hardcore [[13-year-old boy]] who is behind [[Pussy|12 moâ fuckinâ proxies yo]]. If you make videos about retro games or are one of his friends heâll prank call your house, call you a faggot, or make a remix of one of your shitty video game pickup videos. His hobbies include touching his computer, licking his computer, and discussing [[JewTube]] accounts. [[Last Thursday]] he got a massive erection, raped a Best Buy employee, and gave birth to JEBBUIT who happens to be our next [[ Retard|wonder-child.]]

JEBBUIT is the worst of them all. He is the [[Wincest|deformed 2-headed offspring]] of Chase. He claims that he is a computer fag when deep in his ginger heart he knows that he is an RVGK. James {JEBBUIT} will likely crawl back in to his mother's uterus when he gets in high school and will reside there for all eternity. 

This article section was written by [[Retro_Video_Game_Kids#.22Chris_Martinez.22_orbitmint4_.2F_.22Popi_Tirado.22_Popibros1|OrbitMint4]], [[Retro_Video_Game_Kids#Dante_Scaglione.2FSnifitdude|SnifitDude]] and [[Weeaboo|Galaga135]]

==What's in Store for the Retro Kids?==
[[Image:Gamer.png|thumb|180px|right|The future RVGKs have to look forward to.]]
Like other self-proclaimed "[[Lonely|collectors]]" of [[worthless|novelty]] toys, the retro kids will continue to amass coffee-stained [[NES]] cartridges and non-functional gimmick controllers well into their adult years. As they all admit to [[Bully|hating school]] and [[fail|doing poorly at it]], the bulk of them will not be attending [[college]], opting to continue [[Basement dweller|living at home with their parents and collecting their video games instead]]. By this point, [[IM|their only friends]] will be their other e-buddies, and they will have convinced themselves that [[Lemonparty|they are the only friends they will ever need]].

[[File:Lol_meds_suicide.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[An hero|A fitting end]] for those unfit to live in the real world.]]

Eventually, they will be sentenced to the [[RL|Hell that is the working world]], when their parents finally get tired of paying for their sick addiction themselves ''(They will be content in allowing the addictions to continue, however, as it keeps them quiet and out of their hair''). The only [[Goatse|openings]] available will be [[Mexican|minimum-wage positions]] at [[McDonald's|fast food establishments]] and [[Wal-Mart|electronics stores]]. Finding the choice rather obvious, they will proudly put on their blue t-shirts and yellow namecards, and spend company time browsing [[eBay]] for great deals on discontinued [[Atari]] products. They will either [[Unemployment|lose their job]] because of this, or because of their inability to interact with customers. And so, back home they will go, perhaps having earned enough in their brief employment to afford a fancy [[Sega Genesis]] controller with turbo buttons.

One day, whichever parent got stuck with them after the divorce will finally get sick of their shit, and kick them out of the house and into the [[RL|outside world]], willing to pay for [[Shay|an apartment in the worst side of town]] and nothing more. Having black person, no [[cracker|street smarts]], and [[Chris-Chan|no social skills]], they will be completely unprepared for the real world, and will only have the video games they are too stubborn to sell to give them comfort. If they're lucky, they will eventually [[not|wise up]] and start selling their retro tat piece by piece, in a desperate final effort to put some [[Ramen|food]] in their scrawny stomachs. Of course, they'll only have so much stock to get rid of, before they are left [[Shay|cold and alone in their piss-stained single-room apartment]]. With their last breaths, they will cry out for their mothers, before [[an hero|jumping off the roof or slitting their grease-stained wrists]].
