'''TheAmazingAtheist''' (b. Thomas James Kirk, February 20, 1985) is an unamazing, neckbearded idiot who sits on his fat ass all day making militant, gay, pseudointellectual [[atheism]] videos in his garage while dreaming he had a girlfriend to suck his little asian boy penis. He has made innumerable YouTube videos insisting that he is indeed an atheist as well as a faggot and that the world needs to deal with it already. He's a sexually molested metalhead fanatic, high school dropout, closet furry with a severe [[BDSM]] submission fetish, has a sexual attraction to underage children because he himself was molested by a Catholic priest as a child, not to mention that he looks like the long-lost son of [[gay|Bruce Vilanch]] and was the inspiration for The Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons. He has released two [[fail|mediocre]] books, which both contain a list of gullible kids across America, the best ways to [[Pedobear|molest]] them, and how to get away with it. 

According to Terroja, pedophiles shouldn't be in prison--they're just misunderstood and persecuted, just like [[Jews]], [[blacks]], and Catholic priests, but this is just him trying to massage his hurt ego because of the time he himself got molested. A note to the [[FBI]] agents undoubtedly reading this site: check this motherfucker out--he's bound to have a [[kiddy porn]] stash large enough to give [[R@ygold]] a run for his money.  

His views are largely deemed [[irony|ironic]] considering that he believes in no Gods but is clearly the bastard offspring of [[Cthulhu]] and [[co$|Xenu]].

====TheAmazingAthiest got molested====
In complete contrast to stating that being molested as a kiddie causes no psychological damage whatsoever, TheAmazingAthiest confesses his childhood trauma.

===TheAmazingAtheist's "Proof" That God Is Not Real===
Who can argue with this [[logic]]?

===Nigggots===
To the surprise of no one, a video called ''Nigggots'' surfaced on the Amazing Racist account. Apparently, in the first few minutes of babble, he blurts out "nigger" and "[[faggot]]". Being the original man he is, TJ most likely [[original content|stole]] the idea from [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2nTbqbtGug this Youtube video]. Here is a satire depiction of the clip with the bullshit cut out.

'''OH NOEZ!!! - A LAWLSUIT - Note : this video was removed within 4 hours of posting - but its removal was NOT connected to AA insulting /b/ in the comments and NOT related to the subsequent hacking of his bank accounts.'''

{{quote|You have ''24 hours'' to remove my artwork and writing from your webpage, or you will be served with a massive, life-ruining [[lolsuit|lawlsuit]]|TheAmazingAtheist, [[at least 100 years ago]].}}

{{squote|My autobiography is on there. Two of my poems are on there. My drawings "Terroja is Meat" and "Sheepfucker" are on there. It contains more of my content than it does original content.}}

In other words, AA was going to sue over an [[MS Paint]] drawing of some guy fucking a sheep in the ass.

Update: He still wants to sue Encyclopedia Dramatica.

{{quote|Well god damnit, it's my intellectual property!  I should be able to sue over that! |TheAmazingAtheist, talking about that MS Paint drawing of a guy fucking a sheep up the ass.}}

==="You have been blueberry pied"===
<center><youtube>fvHe7-NHJ4Q</youtube></center>

On April 2nd, 2009, TAA unleashed a total [[meme]]fail unto the people of YouTube. The video consists of him repeating the phrase "BLUEBERRY PIE" for nearly 40 seconds. It is titled "You have been blueberry pied", which means TJ thought this would be like a [[rickroll]].

===Anyone Bullied Into Suicide Are Pussies===
<center><youtube>UOF3t3h8QhE</youtube></center>

Some time in [[2010]] Teroja made another shitty vlog about how the [[fags]] that commit [[an hero|suicide]] had it coming.

Basically he called lots of dead [[losers]] a load of dead losers, for actually [[strutting leo|caring what other people think]] which is the only valid point he hes [[evar]] made in any of his shitty vlogs.

If that statement of fact doesn't make you seethe with rage, then your testicles have an appointment with my size 15's (if you don't have testicles, then your opinion doesn't really matter).

I told all you well-meaning fucks that cheered like retarded monkeys at a shit-flinging contest that they were going to go after the food next, and you laughed and called me ridiculous and spanked my bottom with nazi-insignia paddles, telling me what a naughty boy I was . . . Um . . . nevermind . . .

THE POINT IS THIS!: I should have the freedom to be as unhealthy as I want to be and companies should have the right to sell me the most heinous substances on earth as long as they don't misrepresent the product to me! It's this little thing that's been going out of vogue lately that I like to call freedom of choice.

Freedom has consequences. We used to understand that those consequences were worth it. When did we forget? When will we remember again?

When is America coming back?|Terroja Lee Kincaid, where the extra fat came from.}}|color=#ffffff}}</center>

==FreeSpeechVids==
<center><youtube>VeiIpHPdgzc</youtube></center>

FreeSpeechVids was TheAmazingAtheist's attempt at making a competitor to JewTube.  Much like his many other failed online ventures, such as attempting to be an author, it crashed and burned fairly quickly.  Because he is fairly popular on JewTube, he assumed this would instantly translate into extremely popular websites, message boards, books and anything else he conjured up, not realizing he's achieved this popularity mostly by self-censoring and appealing to the lowest common denominator, making him an easily accessible trick pony.  This also meant he could no longer make videos about rape or bashing Christians anymore (the whole thing people watched him for in the first place), because that would threaten his YouTube partner status.  Why he's willing to do this is because JewTube has become his sole means of income through advertising revenue, since he's unwilling to compromise himself by going to school or getting a job.  

Realizing that his money rested on him being a sell-out, but still craving to make his pseudo-intellectual videos, he came up with FreeSpeechVids.  It purported to not only allow people to watch him make videos promoting pedophilia, but a place where you too could make any video you want free of censorship.  He set up a rather humorous donation run for the site with his buddies at [[BlogTV]] (see video on the top) which ended up falling short of their goal of thousands of dollars and ended up being shut down by moderators for it degenerating into violent threats and drunken dumbassery.  As such, when it did finally come up, it crashed in a single day because the bandwidth was too much for TJ to handle.  According to someone who worked on the site:

{{quote|tj is incompetent.... he takes all the money for himself. He doesn't know how to properly make a good video site for people, and he never bought enough bandwidth. He﻿ also never bought a dedicated server. He also never thought to get a security system from the beginning so he wouldn't be hacked....}} found here: http://www.youtube.com/comment_servlet?all_comments=1&v=xOGqsxbjWq4

When the site came back up it became two sites, one that was tightly controlled by TJ, with only TJ approved material being accepted, and a Ning site, a free hosting video site that no one in their right mind would flock too.  Another problem with the site was the name itself.  It was a complete lie, as TheAmazingAtheist said himself in an answer to "does the site really have anything to do with free speech if you censor videos?":

{{quote|No, it really doesn't. We just happen to have a different standard than Youtube and will allow more shit than they will. Really, the concept has evolved into something entirely different than what we initially were going for and a name change is probably imminent.}} 

Despite the fact the site was made so he could avoid selling out for advertising, the site became a living embodiment of his self-censorship and appeasement of advertisers just to keep himself from getting a damn job.

[[Image:ScreenShot003.gif|right|thumb|450px|Typical message that was sent to users of FreeSpeechVids.]]

After a couple of months, TheAmazingAtheist realized FreeSpeechVids wouldn't give him the platform to make his pseudo-intellectual videos and increase his internet welfare checks, so he shut it down.  His last statements on the site:

{{quote|As of today we have decided to shut down FSV. This means we will also be closing down this ning community. We had high hopes but found we were putting ourselves in a box. The best way we think is to take what we learn and form a partnership with some other like minded people to launch a new web service.  In the mean time we will be adding some forums to theamazingatheist.com. These forums will have clear cut rules and will focus on inclusion, not exclusion, as many of us here have been guilty of in the past.}} 

Expect drama to come if his forums (not his first attempt at that) do get made.

==Terroja's [[fail|personal]] sites get haxx0rd==
[[Image:Terrojicomhaxx.jpg|thumb|left|Terroja.com now a shitty blog with bitching and [[tl;dr]] poems.]]
Many of Terroja's sites, constantly get hacked by a [[Muslim]] [[terrorist]] group named "Qabandi Peace" resulting in many lulz. Here are some examples.

====Poetry====
[[Image:TheAmazingGaytheist.jpg|thumb|[[MOAR]] [[EMO]] [[PLZ]]!!!!]]

Like most faggots, TheAmazingAtheist enjoys writing poetry inspired by topics ranging from "the deep dark abyss of my heart" to "the even deeper, darker abyss of my heart." Propelled by the praise from the kind of manic atheist fuckwits on YouTube who give even Deists and Agnostics a bad name, he has continued sharing his cringe-inducing poetry with the community, considering himself some kind of modern day Ovid.

<pre>Somehow I manage to fake a lack of interest
And she untangles the room with her footsteps
Hemorrhaging conversation, I drink her milky words
Like soup from invisible wounds and
Content in my obscurity
Proceed to destroy her
In a gentle manner
Until she is
Mine</pre>

<pre>A man walks through endless desert
Pistol shining in the sunlight
An erratic Morse code
Nevertheless repeating, "doom"

Often has he reddened the sands
With a black song in his black heart
Watched as small hands fell from large hands
Watched as wholes became divided
Into seeming infinities that mock the stars

And this man, who is evil
His shadow on the sand
Always behind him
Is named Salvation

And that is his tragedy</pre>

<pre> I dreamed of a mountain
tall enough to scrape the moon
a great man stood beside it
dwarfing it, and soon
he'll place his foot upon it
and ground it into dirt
then he'll swallow up the sun
and bring darkness to the earth

I dreamed of a towering castle
erected to our lusts
It's moat of genetic matter
just a thick and flaky crust
eaten away by parasites
worming in, out and through
it's good enough for them
but nothing ever pleases you

I dreamed of rotten faces
staring in from the abyss
of lives i could have lived
if it had not come to this;
this dream i dared to dream
while I was wide awake
when the epiphany struck me
that not all dreams are fake

I dreamed of false confessions
to conceal my real vice
and sate my mindless want
to reclaim an earthly paradise
a place where i can be alone
but never feel lonely
no need at all for anyone
to comfort, love or hold me

I dreamed that I was once awake
and that my dreams wouldn't come to pass
but the comfort that this gave me
was a lie that couldn't last
so when you want a prophet
but don't want to hear prophecy
I predict that you'd do well
to stay the fuck away from me</pre>

<pre>Love turned on you and
Suicide turned you on
Death is just what's left when
Every source of pain is gone

Hell is at least hopeless and
Therefore less sadistic than earth
A little ray of light only
Serves to magnify the hurt

The cowards keep on living
Just to spite the love of wisdom
In the choice between dark and light
They've chosen the breathing prison</pre>

====His Comics====
This might explain his hatred towards others.
[[Image:cannibalTerrojas.JPG|left|thumb|Terroja is into necrophilia with elderly men.]]

====His Book (SCUMBAG:Musings of a Subhuman)====
No, that's not a joke; that's the genuine title.

Like a typical fag with delusions of grandeur, he's bringing out some shitty book, and 100% of his videos as of late have been trying to sell it. A few hours after his book was published on lulu.com, Supexcellency, another YouTube Atheist, spread his book around numerous torrent sites for the lulz. When TAA found out, he made several angry neckbeard videos screaming "[[IM PRESSIN CHARGES]]!" causing his little army of [[13-year-old boy]] fans to flag Supexecellency's account, which subsequently caused it account to get suspended. It should be noted that TAA admits that he downloads music and movies on a regular basis; he just doesn't like it when it happens to him. Download it [http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3840320/Scumbag__Musings_of_a_Subhuman] here, and give a review below for the lulz.

{{squote|The first few pages are pretty much empty.  Title page, then some [[shit]] about who he loves/who he had [[secks]] with, despite the [[neckbeard]].  I doubt the validity of this statement since its hard to conceive TAA ever having intercourse with someone who wasn't a [[man]], [[child]] or [[trap]].  After that is some writing by some asshole named [[Fakesagan]].  Skipped it.  Then I read the first sentence of the actual book, wasn't impressed and scrolled down to look at all the shitty "artwork".  In short: [[tl;dr]].  I give it 5 stars out of [[at least 100]].| Albinotron}}

{{squote|This book starts off with a big middle finger towards his "fans" saying he doesn't give a shit about their constructive criticism or messages. Pretty much his whole book is inviting people to "Suck [his] fucking cock" or send him naughty pictures by email or some shit like that. It's pretty much the same strawman arguments over and over again. Religion kills people. Christians are stupid. Nazism, Crusades, Jihad, my penis is small. He even goes as far as to say that atheists are inherently intellectually superior to theists- that it doesn't matter if you convert a Christian to atheism: they are still perpetually stupid. Later, he starts whining over various non-religious aspects of modern society in a very Maddox-esque nonlulzy way. He even says how hard it is being a "internet celebrity." Bitch, please.| Killamoe}}

{{squote|The book starts off with a bunch of [[shit nobody cares about]], and the a foreword by [[Fakesagan|some douchebag]]. "[[lie|I've never been a fan of lengthy forewords, so I'll keep this one brief.]]" I wish that were the truth, but it isn't. Its Fakesagan kissing TJ's ass for [[at least 100]] pages. After that bullshit is done, we finally get to...[[deviantart|a crayon drawing of TJ]]? *[[facepalm]]* ONCE WE FINALLY GET TO THE FLESH OF THE BOOK, its exactly what the title implies. TJ rambling and ranting about everything and nothing... [[TL;DR|for 129 pages]]... Its pretty much his YouTube videos in book form. But unlike his videos, we don't get the entertainment of [[funny|watching his fat jiggle around]], or the tone of [[unwarranted self-importance]] in his voice. Jew. [[fact|Not worth the read]]. [[truth|Massive truck of fail, please]].| Flaming-biscuit}}

====His Documentary (No, really) ====

In another recent attempt to cash in on his [[fail|interesting life]], he has sucked the [[cock]] of some [[wigger]] by the name of Cody Webber (who is clearly a raging [[faggot]]) so that he'll make a Failumentary about his obesity and donuts that he's selling for the low, low price of $50!!! As always expect every single video he makes for at least a hundred years to be shamelessly flogging this pathetic display of [[USI]] and [[AIDS]]. But wait there's more! He's releasing special 'discount' codes (Oh, because so many people who actually like him have the intelligence to remember any combination of buttons.) just to get his entourage of sycophants to OH SHI- BUY! his crappy [[fail]], no doubt he'll have [[Over 9000]] of these last-minute deals.

[[Protip]]: Torrent it and spread it like [[AIDS]] in a gay bar.

=How to troll TheAmazingAtheist=
[[Protip]]: simply bringing up EncyclopediaDramatica or calling him fat won't suffice.
*Bring up [[Thunderf00t]], a rival JewTube atheist whom he's butthurt over for making a video showing how e-beggars and JewTube partners who live off their e-income are living on borrowed time.  Despite the fact the video didn't even mention him, he's extremely hurt from it and has tried to troll Thunderf00t by dropping his name (failing at that and dropping a faux name Thunderf00t uses to trick people) and insisting it makes him a fag, despite his given name "[[homosexual|Terroja]]."  Check his channel description and there's always a new insult levied against him, he's borderline obsessed with him. (the video that makes him all butthurt: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIj8PXOe9Cc&feature=channel)
*Bring up {{ytlink2|StraightD0pe|StraightD0pe}}, a YouTuber devoted to exposing liars on the site that while only have six thousand subscribers compared to TJ's one hundred thousand, still makes him feel butthurt and has attacked him rather viciously on his BlogTV sessions.
*Make fun of his art.  Yes, seriously, he wishes he could sue people for making fun of that MS Paint shit he's drawn.
*Make fun of Macs.  He's a Macfag, though he doesn't actually use one.  He actually laments about not having the money to buy those overpriced pieces of shit.
*Say [[video games]] are superior to films.  This particularly bothers him because he's been forced to tone down his insults towards video games to appease his fanbase that pays his e-welfare checks.
*Say that Marilyn Manson can't sing anymore: tell him that Manson is now fat and that he sings like a drunk Hello Kitty.

==Befriending a Troll==
Recently, TheAmazingAtheist encountered a seriously [[noob|new]] troll who had trouble dealing with a lolcow of this magnitude: 

<center>[http://tw.youtube.com/TheAntiChrisCometh The fail troll's jewtube (TheAntiChrisCometh) can be found here. '''CLOSED''']</center>

Judging by the cancer's obsession with making it known that he is indeed from /b/ (in order to gain street cred) and is "troll-enough" to know what ED is, it's easy to assume that hornydear@hotmail.co.uk is also the owner of [http://www.youtube.com/HORNYDEAR jewtube.com/HORNYDEAR also now '''CLOSED'''], which features two videos about ED and a call to arms to stop his incestuous big brother, [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/BigDaddyBear BigDaddyBear].

[[BigDaddyBear|"HORNYDEAR (who apprently has no understanding of irony) recently made two videos complaining about his big brother just because the latter likes to occassionaly play with the former's pooper. It ws apparently HORNYDEAR who introduced BDB to the world of the Furries. What then was he fucking expecting?"]] However, on the HORNYDEAR account,  it suggested that he later committed [[an hero|suicide]] (see [[Yatagarasean]] article for full details).

(5/17/2007 3:29:35 AM) terrojathewise@hotmail.com is now known as tj.<br><br>
(6:53:42 PM) tj: Is this the real websnarf or a sock account? (like a sock would answer honestly to begin with).<br>
(6:54:10 PM) qedwebsnarf: Tell me.<br>
(6:54:27 PM) qedwebsnarf: If you asked a master conspirator if he was running a conspiracy, what would you expect him to anwer.<br>
(6:54:53 PM) tj: I'd expect him to answer no.<br>
(6:55:11 PM) qedwebsnarf: And what if he were not a master conspirator?<br>
(6:55:24 PM) tj: Also no.<br>
(6:55:54 PM) qedwebsnarf: You have now doubled the number of sentences you have ever written to me in our respective YouTube carreers.<br>
(6:56:19 PM) qedwebsnarf: So you saved the stickam PM did you?<br>
(6:56:28 PM) tj: Yes. I believe so.<br>
(6:56:34 PM) qedwebsnarf: Do you have the date on it.<br>
(6:57:20 PM) tj: Sent on May 2, 2007 @ 2:12 AM GMT<br>
(6:57:27 PM) qedwebsnarf: Well done.<br>
(6:57:44 PM) qedwebsnarf: What is the date on the video you created entitled "Websnarf. Stop."?<br>
(6:58:24 PM) tj: May 5th.<br>
(6:58:42 PM) qedwebsnarf: Subtract 2 from 5 and tell me is the result positive or negative?<br>
(6:58:45 PM) tj: A day before I learned of the "plot"<br>
(6:58:53 PM) tj: after, rather.<br>
(6:58:59 PM) qedwebsnarf: Ok.<br>
(6:59:26 PM) qedwebsnarf: Now, for some information you don't have.<br>
(6:59:26 PM) tj: So, yes, the next day.<br>
(6:59:41 PM) qedwebsnarf: Fakesagan was asked to join very early in the project.<br>
(6:59:56 PM) qedwebsnarf: Fakesagan spilled the beans almost immediately.<br>
(7:00:17 PM) qedwebsnarf: Now try to apply some grey cells to the facts you have and these facts I have just given you.<br>
(7:00:49 PM) tj: Oh. It all makes so much sense. One day the jury was out for you, the next day you were busy plotting the downfall.<br>
(7:00:52 PM) tj: It's all so clear now.<br>
(7:01:03 PM) qedwebsnarf: Ok.  That is only one thing.  I am not done.<br>
(7:01:08 PM) tj: Thanks for making me see reason, you fucking genius you.<br>
(7:01:15 PM) tj: Go ahead. Proceed.<br>
(7:01:21 PM) tj: Illuminate matters further.<br>
(7:01:22 PM) qedwebsnarf: I see.  Is this the way you want it to be?<br>
(7:01:31 PM) tj: Yes. Damn straight.<br>
(7:01:40 PM) qedwebsnarf: Then why are you talking to me?<br>
(7:01:47 PM) tj: Common courtesy.<br>
(7:01:58 PM) qedwebsnarf: Interesting.<br>
(7:02:03 PM) tj: You added me, so here I am.<br>
(7:02:41 PM) qedwebsnarf: 1) You, hardcase, and a handful of your siccophants are the only people who think the video is an anti-ASU video.<br>
(7:02:49 PM) qedwebsnarf: 2) Its not *MY* video.<br>
(7:03:14 PM) qedwebsnarf: It was certainly not *MY* conspiracy.<br>
(7:03:25 PM) qedwebsnarf: I met some of those people in the video for the first time.<br>
(7:03:28 PM) tj: 1. Not true. I know the histroy of that video and how it came about. The original video was meant to be a much more overt attack.<br>
(7:03:44 PM) tj: Besides, that's your fault for selling it to HC as an anti-ASU video.<br>
(7:03:53 PM) qedwebsnarf: No, that was an idea that was kicking about that did not include very many people at all.<br>
(7:04:14 PM) qedwebsnarf: Yes, I know you listen to him now as your replacement for OLG.<br>
(7:04:38 PM) qedwebsnarf: This isn't about him.<br>
(7:04:52 PM) qedwebsnarf: You have an interesting way of communicating.<br>
(7:04:58 PM) qedwebsnarf: Here's a question I have for you.<br>
(7:05:17 PM) qedwebsnarf: If you wanted to talk me out of making this video, why did you make a public video about it asking me to stop?<br>
(7:05:40 PM) qedwebsnarf: Is Hardcase some incontrovertable perfect source of information that you don't need to check without question?<br>
(7:05:47 PM) qedwebsnarf: When is the marriage?<br>
(7:05:53 PM) tj: Hold on<br>
(7:06:47 PM) tj: What choice do I have but to take him at his word? That was my sole source of information. Maybe if you hadn't decided to exclude me and my camp from the knowledge of the video . . .<br>
(7:06:54 PM) qedwebsnarf: Hey idiot.<br>
(7:06:58 PM) tj: If it wasn't anti-ASU, why was it kept from me?<br>
(7:06:59 PM) qedwebsnarf: I have an email address.<br>
(7:07:02 PM) qedwebsnarf: I have a PM box.<br>
(7:07:08 PM) qedwebsnarf: I have a stickam PM access.<br>
(7:07:16 PM) tj: Why were you so pissed that I found out about it?<br>
(7:07:29 PM) qedwebsnarf: And you can see from the storyboard there were 10 people you could have contacted about the video.<br>
(7:07:39 PM) qedwebsnarf: Because you ruined the primary joke of the video?<br>
(7:07:54 PM) qedwebsnarf: Some comedians don't like the heckers to ruin the joke.<br>
(7:07:59 PM) tj: The joke was us. I wasn't going to stand for that.<br>
(7:07:59 PM) qedwebsnarf: *hecklers<br>
(7:08:04 PM) qedwebsnarf: Really?<br>
(7:08:13 PM) qedwebsnarf: Can you do a deconstruction of the joke for me?<br>
(7:08:16 PM) tj: Don't bother correcting your spelling. It's not as if my opinion of you will get lower.<br>
(7:08:23 PM) qedwebsnarf: Nice.<br>
(7:08:31 PM) qedwebsnarf: I see the common courtesy just oozing.<br>
(7:08:44 PM) tj: You called me an idiot. All bets are off now.<br>
(7:09:04 PM) qedwebsnarf: Right.<br>
(7:09:18 PM) qedwebsnarf: Because calling me a liar was not a problem for you.<br>
(7:09:25 PM) tj: You are a liar.<br>
(7:09:34 PM) tj: I asked you a question. I received a false answer.<br>
(7:09:39 PM) tj: What else could you be called?<br>
(7:09:42 PM) qedwebsnarf: You did not.<br>
(7:09:48 PM) qedwebsnarf: The answer still stands.<br>
(7:09:54 PM) qedwebsnarf: Even today it still stands.<br>
(7:09:55 PM) tj: Oh really?<br>
(7:09:59 PM) qedwebsnarf: That's what you don't get.<br>
(7:10:04 PM) qedwebsnarf: That's what hardcase doesn't get.<br>
(7:11:28 PM) tj: You're forgetting something. I've seen the chatlogs. I know how you sold it to him.<br>
(7:11:39 PM) qedwebsnarf: I am not denying anything about that.<br>
(7:11:44 PM) tj: So don't try to shove this utter bullshit down my throat.<br>
(7:11:49 PM) qedwebsnarf: But you are not applying full logic here.<br>
(7:11:53 PM) tj: No.<br>
(7:11:56 PM) tj: And I never will.<br>
(7:12:01 PM) qedwebsnarf: I can see that now.<br>
(7:12:16 PM) tj: Logic is not my mistress. I have flings with her.<br>
(7:12:29 PM) qedwebsnarf: Well ... that will have to be our impasse then.<br>
(7:12:48 PM) tj: You know what--this is all irrelevant.<br>
(7:13:45 PM) tj: The only thing that matters is, I asked you not to make it, and you did anway. You made your choice. You knew what I would do. You decided the video was more important than returning civility to YTAtheism.<br>
(7:14:35 PM) tj: Could I have let it slide? Sure. Few people even perceived it as being about me--but I'm a petty motherfucker.<br>
(7:14:39 PM) qedwebsnarf: I do not take orders from you.<br>
(7:14:51 PM) qedwebsnarf: I did not have orders to give.<br>
(7:14:57 PM) qedwebsnarf: Logic can be useful sometimes.<br>
(7:15:14 PM) tj: Yes. But I'm starting to see that you aren't too fond of it.<br>
(7:15:20 PM) tj: You prefer the appearance of it.<br>
(7:15:26 PM) tj: Twisting words at every turn.<br>
(7:15:48 PM) tj: I didn't ORDER you, dipshit.<br>
(7:15:50 PM) tj: I asked you.<br>
(7:15:56 PM) qedwebsnarf: You asked YouTube.<br>
(7:15:57 PM) tj: Pleaded, in fact.<br>
(7:16:08 PM) qedwebsnarf: You pleaded to the gods.<br>
(7:16:50 PM) qedwebsnarf: I have an inbox.<br>
(7:16:54 PM) qedwebsnarf: You know I am on stickam.<br>
(7:17:01 PM) qedwebsnarf: You don't plead with me like that.<br>
(7:17:06 PM) tj: Why would I bother with that again? So you could lie once more?<br>
(7:17:28 PM) tj: I had to do it publically in order to force the issue to the forfront.<br>
(7:17:36 PM) qedwebsnarf: Oh that's rich.<br>
(7:18:03 PM) qedwebsnarf: By the way.<br>
(7:18:12 PM) qedwebsnarf: Thanks for the 50 subscribers I got out of the deal.<br>
(7:18:18 PM) tj: You're welcome.<br>
(7:18:27 PM) qedwebsnarf: But I really don't need the help.<br>
(7:18:33 PM) tj: I hope they're braindead fucking monkeys.<br>
(7:18:44 PM) qedwebsnarf: Well they come from you.<br>
(7:18:46 PM) qedwebsnarf: So yes they are.<br>
(7:19:06 PM) tj: I am going to hang you with that quote<br>
(7:19:15 PM) qedwebsnarf: Plaese do so.<br>
(7:19:18 PM) tj: You just insulted the intelligence of 3300 people.<br>
(7:19:28 PM) qedwebsnarf: I've done worse.<br>
(7:19:31 PM) tj: And I'm willing to bet they'll be pissed about it.<br>
(7:20:53 PM) qedwebsnarf: Anything else?<br>
(7:21:09 PM) tj: Yes. I hope you get cancer and die.<br>
(7:21:14 PM) tj: Peace.
