'''The People's Communist Republic of Wikipedia'''<sup>[[the Wikipedia Jews|Ⓚ]]</sup>, commonly shortened to simply Wikipedia, is a [[MMORPG|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] in which participants play editors of a hypothetical online encyclopedia. The site is mainly used by fatties who sit on their asses all day in their mother's basement which has been their home since their early twenties. The goal is to try to [[UGC|insert misinformation]] as well as pushing a point of view that is randomly assigned, while preventing any contrary information from being entered by others. Players with similar misinformation will generally form [[cabal|guilds]] in order to [[fellatio|aid]] one another. You can find most [[ED]] [[trolls]] there, too.

Wikipedia players gain more authority as they [[Wikipedia:Special:ListGroupRights|progress]], with "Administrator" and "Double-O Licensed" rankings granting them access to [[hacking|GOD MODE]]. While the rules for winning [[the game]] are a tightly-kept secret, it is believed that the winner is treated to a night of [[Buttsecks|ass sex]] with Wikipedia creator/overlord, the jewbo king [[wikipedo]] [[Jimbo Wales]] (lube not included).

The encyclopedia aspect of the Wikipedia game is a fairly [[typical|obvious]] rip-off of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], except that the Wikipedia version tends to have terminally boring entries on useless topics like [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|the lives of 17th century rabbis, characteristics of the 57th termite chromosome, and Hollywood films including one or more of the ''Sesame Street'' Muppets]] - in other words, content with no real relevance to the [[internets]] or [[porn|internet culture]], and thus is shit. Wikipedia is the worst example of an open-source project in the world. It also functions limitedly as a [[Wikipedia:Pregnancy#Diagnosis|medical journal]] and [[Wikipedia:Improvised_Weapons|criminal resource]] for [[You|retards]].

A [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of common misconceptions|common]] [[Wikipedia:Misconception|misconception]] is that "Wikipedia is never finished." Remember that whenever you come by a Wikipedia article that is boring or filled with poor English skills, that such a refined state of quality did not happen on its own. Each article was forged from the blood of thousands of [[autistic|angsty]] [[teenager]]s [[edit war]]ring over [[shit nobody cares about]]. The only reason [[teenager|anyone]] ever visits the site is to [[copypasta]] it to a <s>college</s> high school research paper. Information on Wikipedia topics could generally be found through [[Google]] and other forms of reference material like [[book]]s, but [[Americunts]] are [[fapping|too busy]] in [[Iraq|brown-people land]] to be bothered with [[education]].

[[TOW]] (The/That Other Wiki) likes to think of themselves as the 21st century's answer to the Library of Alexandria, but they fall somewhere closer to the collective scribblings on a truck stop bathroom wall. Indeed, this holds to the standard modus operandi of Wikipedoes and all [[Liberals|pussies]]) who believe presenting obvious [[Fact|fact]] as [[Bullshit|philosophy]] garners [[Niggerspeak|respect]] from people who [[Reality|don't fucking care]]. The alarming population of [[Fail|fucking failures]] in the world and on the Internet, however, allow this belief to propagate and thrive. 

[[Open Source|Everyone who contributes to Wikipedia]] is plain [[retard|stupid]], since they actually believe that they can make the best encyclopedia in the world, better than the ones people who get PAID can make, its best to assume stupidity on their part. And since you looked this up, chances are [[YOU]] contribute to Wikipedia, so everyone is already assuming stupidity on your part. You are just too stupid to realize it.

==Progression through [[the Game]]==
===How the Game Typically Progresses===
#You make edits to articles
#Your edits get reverted by [[aspie]] [[fucktard]]s
#You revert them back and they in turn revert again
#You bicker on the talk page of the article
#You whine about the aspies on the administrator noticeboards accusing them of being uncivil, they in turn accuse you of assuming bad faith
#You open a [[clusterfuck|Request for Comment]] on their behavior
#You take them to [[Arbitration Committee|arbitration]]
#???
#[[Jimbo]] profits

==[[Power Word|Power Words]]==
Employ the following words to increase your wiki [[bullshit|credibility]]:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_notation CamelCase] - Sticking two words together to form the silhouette of a [[vagoo]].
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitic_canard Canard] - some sort of Jew bird that eats fetuses and desecrates churches.
*Good faith - A codeword for the [[13 year old boy]]s for which wikipedians are on the prowl.
*[[Portmanteau]] - A sexual device used by wikipedians to have [[buttsecks|sex]] regardless of gender or [[aspie|disability]].
*[[schizophrenia|Schism]] - A euphemism for a [[catfight]].
*[[pwnt|Shoa]] - a mythical tale of an effeminate [[weegee|mustachioed]] [[an hero|hero]] who defeats a horde of greedy [[Bestiality|beasts]].
*Admonish - To tie up and make gay manlove with the one that doesn't have complete faith in the Church of Jimbo.
*[[Disregard|Redact]] - To run circles around a pole until exhaustion
*Coatrack - A maniacal stick use by wikipedians to hang their coats on.
*[[Some Argue|Disambiguation]] - A process whereby someone who is unsure about their sexuality undergoes painful [[shemale|gender reassignment surgery]].

==Acceptable Sources==
Wikipedia has very strict standards regarding the [[sauce|sources]] you can use when editing. The following is a list of some of the most common ones.
*[[The Guardian]]
*[[Daily Kos]]
*[[hippies|Huffington Post]]
*[[communists|Junge Welt]]
*[[Best Korea|KCNA]]
*[[gays|PinkPaper UK]]
*[[Michael Moore]] documentaries
*Countdown, with [[Keith Olbermann]]
*Anything by [[Noam Chomsky]]
Additionally, many editors simply cite obscure books that [[no one cares|no one owns]]. [[List of ways to win at the internet|That way, no one will ever check to see if they're bullshitting or not.]]

==How It Could Hypothetically Improve==
The real problem with Wikipedia is the Wikipedians. From players to sysops, every member of its community is the scum of the internets - worse than [[spam]]mers, worse than [[script kiddies]] and [[Nigeria]]n scammers, and worse than [[IRC]]ers. [[Faggot|An average Wikipedia user]] has the intelligence of a seal, as seen <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:122.148.180.50&diff=prev&oldid=218804423#Blocked here]</span> and they only bathe or shower once a month as seen [[Wikipedia:Commons:File:Smegma_Penis02.mirrored.jpg|here]].

Wikipedia is full of people with no desire to improve what it is intended for, information. Instead, they want to grow their e-penis and one day become a [[mod]].

The only way to save the Wikipedia [[MMORPG]] is to delete all usernames and only allow two players to be its administrators: [[Grawp]] and [[Willy on Wheels]].  All other accounts will be reduced to [[b|powerless IP addresses]], its' users continuing their bitching and pedantic arguing.  [[Tosh.0|Tosh]] had the right idea: get over there and post some fucked up shit.

==Images==   
Wikipedia is known for having people that love to provide free-license images of their [[cum|semen]], [[shit|feces]], [[cock|genitalia]], [[amateur|self-made]] [[Crap|pictures]], [[john mccain|and other nasties]]. Rama, a well-known artist for [[drawnsex.com]], draws all the pornographic illustrations. [[your mom|Your family]] is proud, Rama.    

[[tits or gtfo|Posting pictures]] of people on Wikipedia is [[serious business]]. Images of album covers and video games can be used after writing a [[tl;dr]] summary to Master Wales about how this image is fair use, [[shit nobody cares about|despite the law saying that any image used for commentary is fair use]], and by making the image so small that is unviewable. But to get pictures of people, you must take them yourself or get permission. Usually, 'free' pictures of people are either [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mel_Gibson_1990.jpg old as hell], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SusanBoyle_2.jpg painted, as if this were the 1700's] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Replace_this_image_female.svg simply replaced by this placeholder, which people have tl;dr discussions about]. It is only acceptable to post a copyrighted image of a person if they are dead and there are no free alternatives, but even then [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dave_Williams_%28musician%29#Picture they still give you shit about it]. Note that if you break the rules you will be arrested by the [[Web Sheriff]].

A person called [[Boochan]] (on commons and en) has gynecomastia. That's Latin or some shit for "beyond manboobs," meaning guys get breasts larger than a Japanese chick's that even give milk! Damn. So of course, Boochan he likes to upload pictures of himself nekki. ''Image:Gynecomastia 001.jpg'' has somehow avoided being on the bad image list, so we encourage you to vandalize with it on WP.   
   
'''Note:''' Wikipedia references to [[penis]] are also suitable for trolling.

==Tips On Vandalizing Wikpedia==
{{Main|Vandal/How-to}}
[[File:1283297937048.png|right|thumb|300px|An example of subtle vandalism.]]
*subtly insert false info, such as changing a person's birth date from 1970 to 1990, or insert info that is not obviously false, like "x was a distant cousin of bill gates.".
*Make a new account every time you vandalize, so that even if you are caught, the admin can't revert all your past vandalisms.
*vandalize articles that are not actively watched by a lot of editors, such as biography of obscure living persons.
*Always create an informative edit summary for your edits.  For extra points, make up a spiffy character set (with nonbreaking spaces) ...
:* Like ▲ ʙ ɮ Ⅽ Ⅾ ∈ Ⅎ Ғ Ɠ ╠╣ℍ █ ▄█ K █▄ █▀█▀█ █▀█ ●  ℙ ☭ Ⓡℙℝ ▄█▀ ▀█▀ █▄█ ▀▄▀ █▄█▄█ ✖ 匕 ▀█▄    ● ❛❜
*to help your edits look super respectable!

==TOW & ED==
''See also: [[:Wikipedia_Articles_for_deletion/Encyclopedia_Dramatica|Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Encyclopedia Dramatica]]''

[[Image:ED vs Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|left|ED has [[Tits or GTFO|tits]], therefore [[TOW]]-[[fanboy|fans]] are [[homosexual]].]]

[[Image:44407e8f.jpg|thumb|Even as a [[sauce|source]], they still [[RAGE|hate]] us.]]

[[At least 100|It all started one day]] when [[Jameth]], typing with only his [[cock|penis]], attempted to enter the [[mediacrat]] drama as a Wikipedia entry. It was [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mediacrat|discussed and denied]]. This act alone sparked the creation of the wiki [[You|you're]] reading right now.

Every year, Wikipedia pretends that they are going to delete the [[Recovered|Encyclopedia Dramatica article]]. [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Encyclopedia Dramatica|Occasionally]] they do for brief intervals, mostly on the grounds of hosting the previously-deleted [[Mediacrat]] entry, but usually they <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&action=history wuss]</span> [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Encyclopaedia Dramatica|out]] of it. Looks they were [[serious business|serious]] [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Encyclop%C3%A6dia Dramatica %283rd nomination%29|this time]]. 

Wikipedia's steadfast refusal to host an [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] article has been the source of a great deal of hilarious [[drama]] on the site. Yet [[TOW]] continues to cover up any controversy associated with the topic and deny the creation of the article, even one that is [[Boring|unoffensive, informative, and well written]]. Wikipedia has articles on [[Wikipedia:Bukkake|Bukkake]], [[Wikipedia:Goatse.cx|Goatse]], [[Wikipedia:2 Girls 1 Cup|2 Girls 1 Cup]], an extensive disambiguation page on [[Wikipedia:Dong|dong]]s (including a page on a male [[porn]] star named [[Wikipedia:Long Dong Silver|"Long Dong Silver"]]), and [[God]] knows what else. However, [[do not want|refused]] to allow a page on [[ED]] simply out of spite.

Update: Last closing argument (aside from [[Sceptre]]'s faggotry):
{{squote|Encyclopedia Dramatica – Reclosing this for the second time. We have a consensus - i.e we want to see an extremely well written draft with impeccable sources before we touch this again.|Spartaz Humbug! 19:54, 3 May 2008 (UTC)}}

'''An [[Wikipedia:Encyclopedia Dramatica|Encyclopedia Dramatica article]] has been up on Wikipedia, in all its [[lulz|lulztastic]], properly sourced and cited glory since [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Encyclopedia_Dramatica at least May 2010}.'''
</center>

As expected, it took only a few hours for many [[Wikipedo]]s to go into [[pedobear|childlike]] [[BAW|tantrums]], thus forcing yet another [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Encyclopedia Dramatica (2nd nomination)|deletion review]], [[vfd|deletion review]] number 57 to be [[fact|exact]]. The topic of this deletion review is to determine the validity of sources. When the article was created, the source list was actually larger than the article itself, but this has since been trimmed down for a number of arbitrary reasons, the most prevalent being that TOW's editors are unable to live up to their own retarded [[NPOV|rules]]. Overall consensus, however, is that the article should stay and that anyone who says otherwise is a [[hypocrite]] who is simply [[butthurt]] over ED's treatment of [[TOW]] and its editors and [[troll|fails to realize that this immature behavior will only further the problem]].

==What's with the '''œ'''?==
The œ is the retarded sister of [[æ]].  It was originally created by the [[Italy|Romans]] to translate the shitty [[Greek]] [[doing it wrong|οι diphthong]]instead of being created by [[Vikings]] like æ.  For being [[fail]] since birth, œ is the most accurate symbol for [[TOW]]; if [[you]] [[some argue|don't think so]], go look for a [[French]] dictionary where œ is [[faggotry|a real letter in that language]], sometimes called the "[[buttsex|e in o]]." In [[French]], it is used in phrases like "œufs dans l'eau" ("[[balls|eggs]] in the [[cum|water]]"). In [[English]], it is used by [[grammar Nazi]]s for [[goatse|beautiful]] words like [[baby fuck|fœtus]], [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|fœderal]] or [[Scat|diarrhœa]].

[[TL;DR]], œ = [[faggotry]].

==What is a Wiki? An Example of Supreme Idiocy==

His response: a brave and bold display of insanity, petty reverts, harassment, personal attacks, irrelevant responses, and trolling. In short, clearly admin material if not for the fact that he was obviously there to have fun and not contribute in any meaningful way, as evidenced by his constant references to ''[[Fresh_Prince|The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', ''Dungeons & Dragons'', and ''[[Pokemon]]''. End result: a permaban and much drama.

Currently Wikipedia contains [[over 9000|3.3 million]] [[English]] articles, 3.3 million of which are [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] from [[ED]], [[Britain|Encyclopedia Britannica]], or [[Futa]] sites. After edits from various [[moderator|admins, editors,]] [[trolls]] and [[vandals]], only 343 articles remain at least 50% [[fact|factually accurate]]. This leaves Wikipedia on an academic par with "[[Star Wars]]: Incredible Cross-Sections: The Ultimate Guide to Star Wars Vehicles and Spacecraft" and "My First Book of Animals from A to Z". All reputable [[college|universities]] and high schools have [[banhammer|permabanned]] the use of Wikipedia in academic citations.

Wikipedia has a concept called [[yiff|WikiLove]] and has a policy of "[[Ass|ass]]-[[You|u]]-[[Me|me]] good faith" amongst its contributors. This is a vital policy because there is no good faith among any of [[Wikipedos]], so it is necessary to at least pretend that the other guy isn't out there to be an [[you|asshole]]. 

Wikipedia's new March 2007 rules demand that an administrator proves he/she has a higher ( PhD ) degree if he [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/12/technology/12wiki.html claims] he has one. So far that [[bullshit]] [[lie]] to the public has not been [[Honorary Ed Lolington|enforced]].

Wikipedia has [[D&D|very weak armor and only a level 3 shield]]. Thus, they are open to a flanking attack from pretty much [[you|anybody]]. And since they have about eighty updates per second, it's easy for a small but [[Defamation|fatally incorrect]] change to [[surprise buttsecks|slip through unnoticed]].  Also, Wikipedia is quite prone to [[hivemind]], since everybody wants to be an [[admin]], and disagreeing with Wikipedia admins is an easy way to not become one.

The [[administrators]] of Wikipedia are generally [[gay|open-source advocates]] and therefore tend to have no knowledge of how to run a successful website. They are constantly [[some argue|arguing]] with each other over how often the [[GNAA]] Wikipedia article should be nominated for [[VFD|Articles for Deletion]] section, disregarding the [[Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines|existing rules]] which prevent multiple attempts. They delete the important sites, but keep the [[bullshit]]. Like [[Wikipedia:Fart lighting|this one]].

Actually, the only thing in which Wikipedia [[fap]] beats [[ED]] is a higher percentage of [[vandal]] users. For a prime example, see [[Sceptre]].

[[no one cares|Contributors to Wikipedia are not valued]].  Bimbo Wales has said that editing is a privilege, so you are not really donating your time by editing articles.  Most contributions (images, text, etc.) are actually [[deleted]], and the users with the most power ([[Administrators]], [[Joe Biden|Bureaucrats]], etc.) contribute the least [[Original Content|content]] to the site. The site is so [[shitty]] that it is pointless to try to improve it. The best way to fix it would be to just [[Delete fucking everything|delete it and start over]].

{{squote|Wikipedia is a stalking mill designed to stroke the egos of social reprobates and other fringe groups who don't belong in [[normal]] society. The [[Basement-dweller|people who are there long term and essentially live there for the most part]] fit the profiles of true [[sick fuck|sociopaths]].

[[Jimbo Wales|Wales]] [[List of ways to win at the internet|developed a great gaming system on Wikipedia]] which he uses to attract [[you|the dregs of society]] -- people who don't have lives are who aspire to be "famous and great" are [h]is marks and he's come up with a rat maze to lure in the stupid, lonely, and ignorant. 

[[Lies|I've been famous and in the public eye for what now -- 15 years? I have to say, power, fame, and attribution are overrated.]] There's a simple wisdom is simply accepting who you are and being happy about it. None of the [[trolls|psychos]] on Wikipedia seem happy, it's a perpetual [[war]] zone and highly competitive. But what eludes all of them is the [[cheese]] at the end of the maze -- there is none -- just the smell of cheese.

Wales and his cronies just [[whore]] all of these idiots through their "Wikigame" (The site is an online gaming system essentially -- see who can get to the end as an "[[Admin]]" or "Arbitor"). Wikimedia then cashes in on everyone's hard work. 

When was the last time Wales took one of his admins to get a massage as a russian house of ill repute on Wikimedia's dime? [[Truth|But HE DOES]].

Bottom line, its a bunch of morons being used to run his business for free, while his cronies back at the Wikimedia offices cash in on everyones hard work and pay themselves 300K+ salaries per year, divert and misappropriate the funds and live the good life by living in fancy hotels and eating fancy meals while the rest of the stupid schmucks [[Basement-dweller|live in their mom's basement]] or their [[Redneck|trailer parks in New Jersey and Alabama]] while Wales and his cronies cash in on YOUR HARD WORK.

It's got to be the second biggest scam after [[Linux]] development. Linus Torvalds has a similar model. Let people "contribute" so they feel good about themselves, while the project and site owners rake in the [[$]][[$]][[$]].|2=Jeff Merkey|3=[http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2009/05/catherine_crier_takes_a_dallas.php ]}}

==Reliability==
[[Image:Wikipediatruth.jpg|thumb|right|Finally! Something on Wikipedia that's reliable.]]
[[Image:Wikipedia-oxymoron-example.png|thumb|left|Example of self-perceived reliability at Wikipedia.]]
[[Image:Wikipedia atomic bomb bias.jpg|thumb|right|The good people of wikipedia handle history's most complicated issues with an opened mind and detached objectivism.]]

In 2007, a variety of scandals began to surface from within Wikipedia.   [[Old Media|ainstream news organizations]] began to openly discuss the common public perception that Wikipedia is "unreliable."  In a sophisticated experiment, it was demonstrated [[Google|googling]] "Wikipedia" and "unreliable" generated more than 502,000 [[I'd hit it|"hits"]].  In contrast, a similar search using "Encyclopedia Dramatica" and "unreliable" generated barely more than 300 [[I'd hit it|"hits"]], [[Fact|with most of these being self-deprecating jokes of humility from Encyclopedia Dramatica]] [[SysOp|editors]]. Thus, it was [[Fact|scientifically proven]] that Wikipedia is much, much more unreliable (see graphic).  Anyone in the world can edit Wikipedia, which means [[lies|you know you are getting information from the best source possible]]. This comes in particularly handy if you [[Wikipedia:Racial slurs|want to learn how to respectfully talk to a nigra]].

==Recent Changes Patrolling (RC Patrolling)==
Why the fuck would anyone want to patrol for recent changes?  The articles are usually [[boring|dull]].  Patrolling edits on Wikipedia is boring as hell. The only reason is to [[troll]].  Cuckolded [[fags]] like [[Wikipedia:User:Ukexpat|User:Ukexpat]] (Ukexpat, has a [[hugbox|loser box]] fetish) cling to RC patrolling as a way to regain even the smallest shred of power after their wives have refused to touch their cocks.  That and possibly selectively reverting to force your [[NPOV|POV]].  If you actually attempt to post [[truth|fact]] on Wikipedia and an RC patroller [[butthurt|doesn't like it]], they will use any sort of retarded excuses to revert or just call it vandalism.  Failing this, they will attempt to make your [[your argument is invalid|facts invalid]] through [[some argue|imaginary people]].

RC Patrollers usually use [[script kiddie|scripts]] to search for [[pr0n|specific things]]. They're actually very bad at catching vandalism in articles (<span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MONGO&diff=prev&oldid=67472921 this one]</span> went unnoticed for 17 days and [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=9466 this] went unnoticed for ''two'' years!), but very effective at finding anyone criticizing admins in talk pages where such criticism is reverted and the person banned forever. Real vandalism lingers and festers until years later, that account pisses an admin off - and it is only through [[wikistalking]] that [[Pedobear|Wikipedophiles]] are able to find [[vandalism]] at all.

Some RC Patrollers are also huge [[hypocrite]]s because they are also vandals.  These [[fake editors]] include Konstable and [[User:Jew Aardvark|Jew Aardvark]].

==Hivemind==
''See also: [[Wikipedia Admin Gallery]]''
[[Image:Wikimania stallman keynote2.jpg|thumb|left|[[RMS]] [[buttsecks|loves]] Wikipedia. No other commentary is needed.]]

[[Wikipedophile]]s, especially [[sysops]] and recent patrollers, share a hivemind.  They all think alike, act alike, and no matter how abusive a member of the hivemind is, they always support it.  Those of the hivemind look like they are [[sock puppet]]s, but [[moonspeak|they actually communicate telepathically]].

In 2005, like a colony of [[Jerry Seinfeld|bees]], the hivemind recognized that those outside the collective had their own individuality.  Now they are a complete collective consciousness like the [[Star Trek|Borg]] and no longer believe identity exists outside the collective.  To them, everyone is fake, an illusion; an actor who has no thoughts, emotions, viewpoints, etc. and must be eliminated/assimilated and until then they do is viewed as [[trolling]].  Any expression of individuality is [[banned]] as trolling or, to use a common wikipodadminism, "disruption."  See [[Don't feed the trolls]] and [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Don't Feed the Divas#How to deal with a Wikipedia Diva|Don't Feed the Divas]], especially the last sentence, which crushes what little self-esteem you may have: 

<center>''"In some cases, the diva will stay retired, '''but the loss will be quickly filled by other editors who are not so high maintenance; editors for whom the goal is not self promotion and validation, but rather improvement of the project."'''''</center> 

The hivemind extends outside Wikipedia as well, on those rare occasions that an admin strays onto another forum. A good way to start a [[flamewar]] with them is to hint, suggest, joke, outright state or otherwise insinuate that Wikipedia is anything less than the greatest academic achievement since the library of Alexandria.

Thus, because of the Hivemind, Wikipedia has immunized itself against any criticism.  Of course, the corollary to this immunity, according to themselves, is because so many people are part of it, it can't be controlled.  And, that because of so many participants, real criticism will come from inside.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Criticize the Hivemind at your own peril, because the Hivemind controls the power to delete your edits, to ban you, and to railroad you from social advancement (as [[SlimVirgin]] did to Gracenotes).  When ED criticized Wikipedia, ED was site-banned in their blacklist.  When Wikipedia Review criticizes Wikipedia, the Cabal removes all links under some kind of definition of "no personal attacks".  Now real newspapers like the Register are criticizing  and the chant goes out "Ban them, ban them, ban them..." [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2007-July/077064.html].  Watch out ''New York Times'', you're next. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/magazine/01WIKIPEDIA-t.html]

==The Asperger Cancer==

[[noone|Any observant]] [[noob|new user]] to Wikipedia will [[philosoraptor|soon ask themselves]] "What's with all the running 'lists' of inane [[shit|bullshit]]?'.  I don't need to see [[shit nobody cares about|a list of Russian deep fat fryer models built in 1963]].  Why are the [[mod|administrators]] [[basement dweller|social misfits]] with [[tard|little sense of wisdom]] or good judgement? Does Jimbo know of this [[faggotry]]?". The answer to both questions is that wikipedia [[asking for it|attracts]] [[Asperger|Asperger zombies]] like flies to [[shit]]. 

These [[Basement dweller|basement dwelling]] [[virgins]] have [[mexicans|alien]]ated millions of [[normal]] people from wikipedia. They take out their [[asperger]] [[rage]] for their [[over 9000|hundreds]] of school yard [[fap|beat]]downs and permanent sexual isolation on the rest of us.  [[some argue|It is believed that]] many of these [[faggot]]s ''cannot even talk'' [[irl|in real life]]. Jimbo can't stand these robots, but their problems are harnessed by wikipedia as unpaid labor, which makes the [[profit|cash]] for his [[hookers and blow]].

[[Asperger]] [[zombies]] are relatively [[obvious|easy to spot]]. They will be:
*[[White]], and male.
*Have their photo on their user page.  Asptards have little sense of what is socially appropriate, and don't realize how [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:H2g2bob they come across]. They mainly have [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:J.delanoy blank, asperger stares. This perma-virgin actually has a picture of himself with Jimbo].
*Their user page will be covered in checklists, 'to do' tables, programming code, personal details, and generally look like a spreadsheet.  Look [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:MBisanz&oldid=338235254 at this fucknut's ('''Matthew G. Bisanz''') older page version, before he knew ED was looking and had found the ''"I fuck on the first date"'' photo-kid all grown up (scroll down)].

==Easy [[eBay]] Profits: Admin Farms==
[[Image:Damn furries wikipedia.jpg|thumb|410px|right|A [[wikipedophile]] put this up on Jimbo Wales's talk page to complain about [[admin abuse]] by [[furries]] in kangaroo suits (look nearly real, don't they?). Jimbo avoided the discussion with a [[banhammer|banning]].]]

While shouting "op me" is an easy way to become an op on IRC, in Wikipedia it takes a [[Cocksucking|little more work]] (but only a little more). The purpose of becoming an admin is to [[Profit|sell your account on eBay]]. ([http://www.wikipediareview.org/viewtopic.php?t=204 source])
#[[New User Registration|Make a new account]] using dial-up or AOL, not proxies. These are the easiest ways to sock puppet and still use your other accounts for things like removing inaccuracies from Wikipedia.
#Create a user page so you look legit. The easy way is to fill it with [[userboxes]] until it looks like ribbons on a third-world military dictator. If you just copy somebody else's userpage, you will get [[Ban|caught]]. Then write up a fake bio that says, "Hi I'm only 12 and want to be an admin some day."  Most admins on Wikipedia are [[NSLE|too young to grow pubes]], so you have to be in their age group. They never vote for anyone old enough to date.
#Don't question anything. Behave like a robot. Get one of those anti-vandal scripts and have it auto-revert while you sleep. Always revert: (1) Someone who reverts an admin--if you're lucky you'll occasionally beat somebody else to this (2) IP address users--because these are all vandals and sockpuppets (3) New contributors - because they don't understand Wikipedia (4) Anyone who has ever been banned before, even for an hour, because they're permanently shitlisted. Now don't worry about wrongly reverting any of these people, it happens all the time. Just say it was a mistake. No one in charge likes these people anyway. Learn the abbreviations for policy pages like WP:NPOV and WP:NOT and use them in your edit summaries. Nobody will care whether your usage makes sense. On talk pages, if someone asks a question, tell them that their statement is original research, speculation, and that Wikipedia is not a forum. Act like it is serious business, also.
#After a few hundred [[fake editor|fake edits]], go to the [[VFD|articles for deletion]] every day. # Next, go to votes for adminship; always vote to support, so those people will vote to support you. This should be obvious. Admins like people who support admins and hate those who are critical of admins. 
#When you reach 4,000 edits, go to requests for adminship and nominate yourself: Poof! you're an admin!!!
#Then go to eBay and auction it.  Make sure the reserve price is over $1,000 so you don't sell it cheap.
#Until the auction ends, don't just do nothing or they'll know it's an eBay sale.  Use the account for things like POV-pushing, banning any of the four shitlisted types you used to only revert (by any, I mean every user you can find).  But if you're too busy, just find someone complaining about admins and ban them forever and lock their talk page; actually you have to do this at least once every day, or else somebody will think the admin account was hacked.

'''If you want to keep your account and not sell it:'''
#Get a life.
#If that fails, do the most respected admin activity, encourage vandalism.  Vandalism is the only way you can justify your job.  If there weren't so many vandals, there would be 4 admins.  So get your script out and just ban randomly.  Be sure to lock the user's talk page.  If you see the user come back on, hide what they write explaining they are a "[[Lie|sockpuppeting troll]]", ban them forever, and lock their talk page.
#Don't bother fighting vandals now.  You've got the equivalent of a government job: you can't get fired, only transferred.  Become a copycat Willy on Wheels and you only get a [[sockpuppet|new account]].

'''Fun activities to do as admin:'''
#Mess with the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace|MediaWiki namespace]].
#Ban other admins for [[lulz]].
#Replace Wikipedia articles with ED ones. It improves accuracy.
#Unban all the [[Willy on Wheels]] accounts. Or just clear the entire ban list.
#[[Goatse]] the Main Page.

==Heroes==
[[Image:Yourmission.jpg|frame|When dealing with [[Willy on Wheels]], it is [[Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines|Wikipedia policy]] to [[serious business|take it seriously]].]]

All over [[teh internets]], people complain about the bad things of Wikipedia; that they're all [[Nathanr|child molester]]s, [[MONGO|Homeland Security agents]], [[Jayjg|Zionist propagandists]], [[ContiE|furries]], Jimbo Wales' alter ego is [[GreenRaeper]] (founder of [[WikiFur]]), how [[Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines|official policy]] permits admin abuse "[[is not a bug, it's a feature]]", and that there are news articles constantly on how they make [[snuff]] films with [[13 year old boys|young boys]].  But nobody notices [[an hero|the heroes]] of the site:
*[[The Colbert Report|Stephen Colbert]].
*[[Don Murphy]]
*[[Willy on Wheels]]
*Señor Pelican Shit - /b/rave soldier who researched and documented [[Pelican Shit]] to a new level, a serious concern still affecting Wikipedia.
*Autofellatio Professor - Helped many people [[wikipedia:Commons:File:Autofellatio 2.jpg|Autofellatio_2.jpg]].
*[[Publicgirluk]] uploaded [[porn|some pictures of herself]] to illustrate relevant articles and got called a troll by the master [[wikipedo]] [[Jimbo Wales|wealthy pornographer]] for her trouble. 
*THE MOTHERFUCKING JUGGERNAUT BITCH!! reputed for massive AOL autoblocks.
*[[Wikipedia:User:MER-C/Blu Aardvark|Jew Aardvark]] Wikipedia Jews masturbate to his photos.
*Squidward, the fastest vandal west of the Mississippi, known for harvesting more open [[proxies]], creatin more sockpuppets than Bomis has porn. He is king gypsy who lives in [[Chicago]] by the lake. He hates Antandrus, Avraham & others [http://antandrus.tripod.com/ as proved by his crappy website]. The Wikipedia Jews are always on the look out to rape him.
*[[:Wikipedia:User:Hephaestos|Mike Garcia]] - high class of vandalism since 2003 ([[loser|get a life!]]) <blockquote>''"He is currently one of Wikipedia's most promising vandals. He appears to be persistent, creative, and knows to vandalize pages that will be seen by many people. One day, he may even be considered in a class along with the great Willy on Wheels, but he will need to "diversify" his vandalism before this can happen. Almost all of his vandalism has been to the English Wikipedia; a good piece of advice to him would be to start attacking admins' user pages on some of the foreign language Wikis. His recent vandalism of the [[Wookieepedia]] shows that he has begun this diversification process already. Mike, you possess a great deal of talent; the sky's the limit for you!"''</blockquote>
*[[Cplot]]--500 [[sockpuppets]] and counting, [[CIA|clowns]]!

==#Wikipedia==
The Wikipedia [[IRC]] chat is a fun place to watch [[Wikipedophile]]s discuss criticism of the project while banning the critics, although a more likely discussion will involve [[Jews|eating Christian babies]], banning other users to get their rocks off. A fun way to troll #wikipedia is to announce that you are logging the channel. For some reason, Wikimediots raise strong objections to the publication of chat logs, so be sure to do it often. Just like Daniel Brandt.

And whatever you do, [[DO NOT LAUGH AT ENCYCLOPEDIA DRAMATICA]].

==What Wikipedia is Not==
Articles in Wikipedia are often deleted with a clever and witty message attached. These "joke deletions" are a fun activity that users play towards each other- whomever writes the cleverest message gets to delete someone else's article, and the author of said article checks up on it only to find it removed, and promptly dies in various fits of laughter. [[Bureaucratic_Fuck#Uncle_G|Uncle G]], a particularly annoying [[Bureaucratic fuck|admin]], invented these colloquial sayings, known as "isnotisms", [[at least 100 years ago|at least 100 days ago]], which are presented in the following format:
*Wikipedia is not [[Wikitruth|the truth]]!
*Wikipedia is not [[Goth|Wiccapedia]].
*Wikipedia is not about the size but how you use it.
*Wikipedia is not a fracking image repository (this is of course a lie; check Commons and Wikigraphy).
*Wikipedia is not a place for master debaters but has lots of hot pics for [[12 year old girls|12-y.o. masturbators]].
*Wikipedia is not a dating service, unless you're NathanR, Snopake, Phaedriel, etc.
*Wikipedia is not [[Uncyclopedia]], but it does [[Wikia|pwn Uncyclopedia]].
*Wikipedia is not headed by little green men but by a man with a little green dick.
*Wikipedia is not a land of milk and honey.
*Wikipedia is not part of a balanced breakfast.
*Wikipedia is not a valid reference material.
*Wikipedia is not a [[Boytaur|gender-confused horse]] but has attracted many [[Kelly Martin|gender-confused men]].
*Wikipedia is not a place for happy people.
*Wikipedia is not above plagiarizing the crap out of everything.
*Wikipedia is in no way [[nathanr|wacky pedophilia]].
*Wikipedia is not [[cat|man's best friend]].
*Wikipedia is not involved in the [[John Seigenthaler|Kennedy cover-up]] (yeah, sure...).
*Wikipedia is not an international crisis, but they like to think they are.
*Wikipedia is not what I put on my toast.
*Wikipedia is not able to endorse [[nathanr|domestic violence]].
*Wikipedia is not 1337. Not in the least.
*Wikipedia is not to be [[drunk post|used under the influence of alcohol]].
*Wikipedia is not as tasty as sushi.
*Wikipedia is not vandal resistant.
*Wikipedia is not suitable for minors.
*Wikipedia is not as hot as [[Lunajack|Luna Lovegood]].
*Wikipedia is not a spell-checker [[Unwarranted self-importance|but thinks it is]].
*Wikipedia did [[Bill Clinton|not inhale]].
*Wikipedia is not [[X is not your personal army|your personal army]].
*Wikipedia is not the answer.
*Wikipedia is not dead nigger storage.
*Wikipedia canNOT hold Grawp's GIANT dick
*Wikipedia is not Wikipedia!.
*Wikipedia is not a big truck. (But it IS a serious of tubes.)

Tellingly, obsessive listmaking is one of the most reliable symptoms of [[Asperger's syndrome|autism]].

==<nowiki>{{</nowiki>[[Wikipedia:Template:unblock|Unblock]]<nowiki>}}</nowiki>??==
This is template you use to ask to be unblocked. After you've been blocked for no reason, you swallow your pride and ask that someone undo it. You then wait for an hour until some 15-year-old denies your request without even looking at it. Sometimes, if you insist arguing, they will block you as well from editing your user talk page, without banning you, for their own private [[wikipedo]] "[[lulz]]". At that point you can only appeal the block by email (which they will probably ignore as the jerks full of themselves they are). 

If you get banned by an admin don't even bother using this because no matter how well-reasoned the <nowiki>{{unblock}}</nowiki> request, it always gets declined. Like <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:81.153.223.189&oldid=142952978 this one]</span>, ''"HOW DARE YOU CALL ME A TROLL M0RESCHI YOU STUPID BASTARD! AFTER WHAT YOU FUCKING DID YOU DESERVE TO BE SHOT!"'' Clearly the person has proved their point, but the bureaucratic fucks are immune to reason or logic. If your request is declined, you may get a lame reason.

Whenever you edit on Tor and the node is blocked, always put an unblock message on that IP claiming it's no longer Tor. Sometimes they even get fooled. Admin said, "First time I've seen such a request where the user was telling the [[truth]]."

==Pornography==
So great is the amount of porn on Wikipedia it (almost) rivals [[ED]] - a [[fact]] made all the more pathetic by the fact ED is made by and for [[basement-dwellers]] and [[trolls|those with a disgusting sense of humour]] whereas Wikipedia is genuinely [[fail|trying]] to educate people. Here is a list of the very full articles dedicating to proving that sad fact:
*<big>[[Wikipedia Porn]]</big>
*<big>[[Wikipedia's Greatest Hits Sex]]</big>
*<big>[[Virgin Killer]]</big> For all you [[pedophile|Loli-lovers]].

==Summation==
Generally speaking, Wikipedia is the compendium of all human knowledge, both true and false.  Except of course where groups (i.e. [[Furluminati]], [[The Wikipedia Jews]]) go around turning arrays of articles into propaganda and bullshit.

Contrast:
*"Welcome to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit." - Wikipedia front page.
*"[Wikipedia] is not a place where people have the inherent right to edit" - Jimbo Wales, October 29, 2007. (<span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents/My_desysop_of_Zscout370&oldid=168329048#Public_apology Source]</span>)
