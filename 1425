Once upon a time, some [[skiddie]]s at [[Raidchan]]/netcollect decided to try and create a chan-apocalypse, and wanted to make the chans blame each other. So they [[DDOS]]'ed all the major Chans, [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], and some smaller sites [[shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about]]. But since this was very clearly [[Anti-lulz|not lulzy at all]], their plan was foiled when a member of their IRC channel saved all the logs where they discussed their operation, and [[Owned|dumped them into pastebin]] along with their [[dox]]. 

Initially, the chans blamed the [[pedo]]s of [[Anontalk.com]], but it turns out they are merely guilty of being [[sick fuck]]s and spamming [[b|/b/]].

== Status ==

Pretty much everything is back up. [[420chan|Everything]] that [[4chan|matters]], anyway.

<s>For the raw pastebin of the [[irc]] logs, dox, etc, go to [http://pastebin.com/m3c5d3c10 this pastebin].</s> EXPIRED.

Here are a bunch of irc logs from raidchan:<br>

Recently, one of the asspies behind this, named ViraL has threatened a certain blogger in the Philippines known as "Mike AbunDORK" with a DDoS attack. 

Here's the comment on DORK's page.

ViraL on August 21st, 2008 at 2:02 pm 
Are you serious right now? Remove all material on us from your site or it won’t come back up. You can’t “prevent” DDoS, and you certainly can’t pipe 70gbps on the budget your on, so if I were you, I’d comply.


== [[Rape]] Victims ==
[[Image:Chanocaust.jpg|right|thumb|nevar forget]]
Due to the vastness of the plan at hand, many sites were targeted for attack.  Although the true culprit was discovered shortly after the DoS started (putting an end the entire idea of a "civil war"), the skiddies continued their half-witted assault, essentially holding a couple sites hostage since they didn't know what else to do after their retarded plan went awry.  Here are the sites that were targeted:  

* [[711chan]]
* [[420chan]]
* [[4chan]]
* [[99chan]]
* [[7chan]]
* [[2ch]]
* [http://shii.org/2ch/ Overchan]
* [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]
* [[anonib]]
* <s>[[YTMND]]</s> Failed, but planned.
* [[4chanarchive]] -- not mentioned, but it went down for a couple days when the DDoS started.

== Moot saves 4chan? ==

[[Image:Nomoardelicioussoup.png|thumb]]

Late in the afternoon on July 27, [[moot]] ran out of [[Brb, soup|delicious soup]] for the [[The Caturday Nap|second time]] and decided that while he waited for his mother to get back from the grocery store, he would fix 4chan. [[Noone]] [[Shit nobody cares about|gives a fuck]] about the other *chans, however, so they remained in their state of [[STD|rot and death]]. Not that they weren't already. However, the soup was still in the microwave, so there was no telling whether 4chan would come back that day or not, as everyone knows that you can't battle [[Faggot|skiddies]] on an [[Pro-ana|empty stomach]]. After [[over 9000|several]] days of waiting, moot gobbled his delicious [[cock|soup]], 4chan was back, and channers everywhere [[Orgasm|were thrilled]].

== The Faggots ==

There were three (or maybe a few more) main [[aspies]] behind this obviously [[Retard|flawless]] scheme, who are now undoubtedly sitting apprehensively in their parents' basements waiting for the [[partyvan]] to come [[SWATed|busting through the front door]]. Their [[OL]] handles are ''Pacifico'', ''ViraL'', and ''f''. Their [[Docs|personal info]] can be viewed in the links to the [[irc]] logs in the above sections. Below is a condensed link to Pacifico and Viral's dox, for those of you too lazy to read through the conversations, or just those of you only interested in their phone numbers and home addresses. They all appeared to be members of netcollect, a [[13 year old boy|skiddie]] group, and are all candidates for "[[Epic Fail Guy|The New Alex Wuori]]".

Now, this is a story all about how<br>
All chans got haxxed-DDos'd until down<br>
So I'd like to take a minute<br>
Just sit right there<br>
I'll tell you how all the sick fucks had to find a new lair<br>

In west Chanatopia boner raised<br>
On the random was where I spent most of my days<br>
Fappin' out winnin' failin' all cool<br>
And all closin' some newfags outside of the pool<br>

When a couple of fags<br>
Who were just two "no good"<br>
Started sending requests for a server flood<br>
/b/ thought it was anontalk and sysop got scared<br>
He said 'I don't even have money for fucking food' this is not my affair<br>

I tried out all chans and when it said 'error'<br>
The IRC said 'RAIDCHAN' and it had dicks as the HaX0r<br>
Only the shitty chans for once were the winrar<br>
But I thought  'Yo homes to 7chan its fuckin' Madagascar'<br>

I pulled up to the rainbow road about 7 or 8<br>
And I yelled to the refugees 'Yo /b/tards the war just started'<br>
I looked at 4chan<br>
It must be soup day at m00t's<br>
inB4 shitstorm, just man up the harpoons.
