All the images worth [[hotlink]]ing (and also the ones that aren't) can be found on tripod.

Tripod is run by Lycos, a search engine which died [[no more than 99]] years ago. It was characterized by the same bullshit adbanners, tool bars, and other useless clutter than made everyone start using [[Google]] instead. It [[Is not a bug, it's a feature|feature]]s free webhosting for [[asslink]] users. Everyone else has to pay out the [[ass]] for the same fecal-feed.
