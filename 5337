Mewtwo
A long, long time ago, somewhere around 1998, a plague swept over America.  Originating from the land of tentacles, this plague, known as Pokemans, raped the minds of every child, and [[Chris-chan]], into worshiping a god of rape.  This god could destroy worlds, erase minds, turn some retard into stone, and even get on the cover of [[Time]] magazine. His minions invaded every school, hospital, and church, causing many a death and seizure.  And lo, this god of rape looked upon the chaos, and it was good.  But then Pokemon 2000 came out, and no one gave two monkey shits about '''Mewtwo''' anymore.

Taking the innocent form of a  [[cute]] [[kitten]], no one ever suspected the true impact of evil his clone penis had  - therefore, inevitably, [[sick fuck]] [[furries]] have [[shipping|paired]] him with every possible [[dick|living]] and [[Necrophilia|non-living thing]] in the Pokémon universe in both prose and picture. See gallery below for the grisly details. He is the [[batshit insane|Mind warrior]] [[Zippocat]] of the [[Pokémon]] universe and the [[Incest|twin brother]] of [[Lucario]].

He also refuses to be caught because he has an [[asshole|attitude]] and it's not his [[lie|destiny]], even if you try using a [[Scam|Master Ball]] he'll just hit it back at you with a tennis racket and call you a [[faggot]]. [[Fail|Failure]] will result in [[the game|losing the game]], and you'll have a problem because [[Pedophile|Professor Oak]] will not refund the [[over 9,000]] dollars it took to get the Master Ball in the first place and Mewtwo already kicked your ass back to [[ghetto|Pallet Town]] and [[gun|popped a cap up ur ass]]. All in all Mewtwo is a pretty violent fellow.

[[Image:Mewcario.png|thumb|The lovechild of Mewtwo and Lucario that resulted from the above pic.  Neither wants to claim responsibility for this abomination.]]
[[Virgins|Pokémon fans]] get into [[nerd rage|furious arguments on forums]] about how he is a copy of another Pokémon called Lucario, or something, and that [[Lucario]] had [[stolen|copied]] his moves in [[Super Smash Bros.]] from Mewtwo. For a taste of idiocy rivaling a [[Gaia]] discussion, check the [[serious business]] from these forum threads:

{{frame|<center>{{morphquote|mewtwoquotes|background-color: #ffffff; width:65%; height:250px|font-weight: bold;|[[Lucario|LUCARIO]] IS NOTHING LIKE MEWTWO, AND HE IS NOT AN IMPROVEMENT, LUCARIO SUCKS, MEWTWO [[ftw|FTW]]!|Freak_255, raging on the Gamespot Forums

|First things first; one is Psychic the other is Steel-fighting. One is [[uber]], the other is BL (dont quote me on that). Finally Lucario and Mewtwo are good fighter <b>when</b> used correctly.|L33TSPEAK, Gamespot Forums

|there both pretty damn [[crap]] overall, as weak as a point that is, there both more individual representatives for the [[pokémon]] [[animu|series]], it does feel like Lucario fights a lot like mewtwo when I have to play as him, aside from mewtwo's [[shit|second jump]] and etc.etc|nintensoldier, Gamespot Forums, Telling the absolute [[truth]].

|That's because it is. [[Lucario]] is just an [[lolcat|'improved' Mewtwo]] with a few different moves. [[truth|Doesn't change the fact that he sucks in Brawl]].|Jormungandr, Gametrailers forums

|[[lucario]] makes [[murder|sudden death]] even more [[now|sudden]] then it already is. Lucario is sort of a new mewtwo,except he's newer he's more powerful and [[underwear|he wears shorts]]|Etherealfrog, Gametrailers forums}}</center>|color=black}}
