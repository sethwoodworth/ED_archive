{{notice|According to Karl's own [http://www.linkedin.com/in/karljorgensen LinkedIn] profile, he hasn't had a [[job]] since [[At least 100 years ago|2007]] and instead sucks the teat of [[Uncle Kage]]'s welfare agency.}}

'''Karl "Xydexx" Jorgensen''' is a moribund, third-rate, washed-up, middle-aged, hypocritical furry. He doesn't have issues - he has the entire fucking print run. Everyone in the fandom secretly dislikes him but they keep their mouths firmly shut so as not to attract his attentions, because he wields immense and terrifying power in the furry world as <s>Propaganda Minister</s> Publications Director and spokesman for #1 [[furry convention]] Anthrocon, a position he secured by diligent asskissing and cocksucking.

Karl went to [[artfag]] school [[at least 100 years ago]] and worked for a while as a glorified secretary, going from job to job and getting fired when it became [[obvious]] than even a [[retard]] could operate [[Microsoft]] Office. Some time in [[last Thursday|2007]] he lost his mind and his job, and now spends his entire life on the Internet. He claims he goes outside, but this claim is dubious because as you'll see in this article, [[Prove me wrong|there is literally no one]] on the Internet who holds an obsessive grudge longer than Xydexx. Most people forget about flamewars days after they're over. You will see that a decade is a mere snap of the fingers to Xydexx and his psychotic obsessiveness.

Lacking anything meaningful in his life, he spends his days editing this article, obsessively searching for any and all mentions of himself anywhere, and generally being [[unfunny]]. He's slowly losing his mind to late-onset [[schizophrenia]] and thinks that this article was written by [[Triggur]] (see below). He reacts to this knowledge by copying this article into a new article about Triggur, just changing the names. In Xydexx's world, this is the height of hilarity.

Currently, Xydexx's only connection to the outside world is the [[Anthrocon]] conbook. [[Uncle Kage]] pays him big [[welfare]] dollars to whip up a jizzrag in MS Publisher for the [[furfags]] attending his [[convention]]. Of course, there being better [[porn]] on the [[Internet]], most furfags send Xydexx's precious conbook right into the trash along with their used condoms. Xydexx hangs desperately onto the conbook ([http://www.furteantimes.com/r/128_furry_news_portal_given_second_chance#comment-427 and has for some time]), because it's the only thing left that gives him the illusion of being useful to the outside world.

==Career==
===Never forgive, never forget===
In the early years, Xydexx spent most of his time on [[Usenet|alt.fan.furry]], making [[flamewar|valuable contributions]] to the [[trolling|debate]] there, when the furry fandom was [[no|more innocent and esoteric]]. It was in his time on Usenet that the famous Xydexx modus operandi was developed, and the slogan by which he lives, "Don't take the [[Internet]] too [[serious business|seriously]]" would first be offered to those who might otherwise take a man who puts his penis in pooltoys seriously.

Xydexx first came to the attention of the Internets at large when his Inflatable Animal Fetish Page was featured on [[Portal_of_Evil|Portal of Evil]] years ago and he flipped the fuck out to hilarious effect in [http://friends.portalofevil.com/sp.php?si=3&fi=000000052&ti=1000183478&pi=1000183478 this PoE thread] (and dozens of others). He is still [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Portal_of_Evil&diff=prev&oldid=1998472598 obsessed], almost a decade after that thread, with PoE and its editor [[Kthor]], whose firm, well-packed butt he admires from afar and who he fervently <s>believes</s> hopes is a secret [[adult baby|diaper freak]].

===Xydexx vs. Goons===
Back in [[at least 100 years ago|January 2005]], Xydexx hilariously suggested that those horrid [[Something_Awful|Something Awful]] Goons be physically chastised to teach them not to mess with the furries in a sequence of inane LiveJournal comments[http://doodlesthegreat.livejournal.com/161426.html posted] which he promptly deleted when the drugs wore off. Two years after the original lunacy, when everyone had forgotten about it, Xydexx resurrected that ancient thread to inform everyone he had created an absurd [http://www.xydexx.com/notforyou/squnq.htm "rebuttal"] of Squnq's "interpretation" of his deleted posts (or something) and basically suggested that Squnq made all that crazy shit up etcetera etcetera.

Since then, his [[butthurt]] has transformed into full-blown [[paranoia]] bordering on [[schizophrenia]], in which anyone and everyone appears to be [[Triggur]], another middle-aged [[furfag]] who is the subject of one of Xydexx's many psychotic obsessions. Currently, Xydexx is using his gaggle of sockpuppets to make weird and pathetic edits to related [[ED]] articles, fooling [[no one]] with his use of the the standard Xydexx catchphrase, "taking the Internet too seriously." One would be tempted to say that this was when the helium finally took over Xydexx's brain and he finally [[insane|lost his mind]], but Xydexx has been fucking balloons for so long that it's hard to decide when, exactly, he crossed the line from being a comically long-term [[lolcow]] to just being another Internet psycho.

===Goodbye, cruel Interweb===
Xydexx closed down his Livejournal in March 2007 and set up under a new name in order to (or so he claimed) escape the "cyberstalking" and "harassment" he had been subjected to online. Immense lulz were caused when he revealed in a friends-only LJ comment that it had supposedly been furries-in-denial [[CrushYiffDestroy]] who had been "cyberstalking" and "harassing" him all this time, and (OMG) confronting him at conventions and making plans to show up on his doorstep. However, Xydexx showed those intolerant antifurs what was what by posting their leader's RL name and address and revealing his pedoriffic tendencies in a call for vigilante furry action, neatly illustrating his saying that ''"Asshats can dish it out, but can't take it."''. CYD recently vanished off the web, but naturally this occurrence is purely conincidental - ''or is it''!?

===Internet Obsessions of the New Decade===
In early 2010 X turned his bile on fellow furry [[Greenreaper]], irate that his furry news site wasn't toeing the official Xydexx line, making bizarre blog posts and trolling comment threads on Flayrah. Following standard Squeakypony operating procedure, he quickly deleted the blog posts after attracting everyone's attention so that he could deny everything and go into a snit about people obsessing over him. And speaking of obessions, he currently seems to be developing a fixation on [[Kindrift]], leading light of [[CrushYiffDestroy#CYD Jr.|Vivisector]], so watch this space!

===What Xydexx Does Outside===

[[At least 100 years ago]], Xydexx [[allegedly]] stole an 18 foot inflatable reindeer from a local mall in [[yuppie|Northern Virginia]], where he lives. He then posted a video of the thing blown up in his bedroom. It was [[baleeted]] shortly thereafter.

===Modus Operandi===
Xydexx likes to talk a great deal about what an elite online mass debater he is, and how [[goons]] and [[troll]]s run screaming from the blinding lights of justice and clarity that are his posts. A brief analysis of his opus reveals the following pattern:
# Accuse opponent(s) of being [[unfunny]].
#* Support this point by making dozens of largely interchangeable comments.
# Accuse opponent of spending [[too much time on the Internet]].
#* Support this point by making dozens of largely interchangeable comments.
# Accuse opponent of taking the Internet too seriously
#* Support this point by making dozens of largely interchangeable comments.
# [[Delete fucking everything|Delete everything]].
# Deny everything.
# Claim victory.

|Hey, man, you don't talk to Xydexx. You listen to him. The man's enlarged my mind. He's a poet-warrior in the classic sense. I mean sometimes he'll... uh... well, you'll say "hello" to him, right? And he'll just walk right by you. He won't even notice you. And suddenly he'll grab you, and he'll throw you in a corner, and he'll say, "What's your fursona?"... I mean I'm no, I can't... I'm a little man, I'm a little man, he's... he's a great man. I should have been a sexy hermit crab scuttling across floors of silent seas... |[http://kindrift.livejournal.com/4497.html Kindrift]

|Besides, everyone knows drama isn't awesome â€” it's stupid, tiresome, and the primary reason [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is and forever shall be the web's lamest wiki.| 

|This has already been debunked elsewhere, but for the record anyone who seriously thinks I support violence against Something Awful needs to have their head examined.| 

|What should have happened, IMHO, was that the furries should have surrounded the car and pelted it with rocks, or even dragged them out of the car and beaten the holy fuck out of them. It's one thing to tell goons "stop fucking with us," but, as the old saying goes, actions speak louder than words. So if that's what it takes, then that's what it takes, y'know?|

|Furries should stop reacting with fear and panic, and start reacting with blanket parties for goons to show up at furry cons. -:)|

|Maybe a few goons need to get sent back to the forums with their noses bloodied to drive the point home.|
