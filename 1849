[[Category:Memes]]<br>

[[Creepypasta]] is a generally [[awesome]] [[internet]] phenomenon which is the basement dweller's equivalent of sitting around a campfire with real human beings telling scary stories and being exposed to sweet sweet social contact. A well written piece of Creepypasta can have even the most seasoned internet user up at night covering their mirrors and dwelling on thoughts of red eyes behind locked doors. However, like [[ED]] in fact, for every cogent and well written piece there are 50 that are just, well, retarded.

==Examples of Crappypasta==

===Can You Smell Fear?===
[[Image:GhastlyKitten.jpg|thumb|right|This appeals to Horrorkitty.]]

So, I'm sitting here on my couch, which is pushed to my computer and the rest of the room is to my back. I'm watching TV and jacking off when I hear this really menacing cackle from behind me. I shit too many bricks to sit up and look behind me, so I just slowly moved my head to the left, where I saw my cat. It was stating either blankly or terrified, at the space right behind the couch, and perfectly frozen in a position I don't normally see it in. I just watched watched it, imagining what kind of evil it saw right behind me, but then I noticed something. It started stretching and contracting its back. It was taking a shit, and the cackle was just it farting. It was staring because it was focusing. I nearly threw up trying to clean it up. God dammit. [[Then a skeleton popped out]].

===Doll House===
[[Image:Scaredkitty.jpg|right|thumb|Just because [[Scared kitty]] is scared, does not mean that it is scary]]
Once upon a time there lived a girl and her mother in a house and in that house roamed a thousand dead bodies in their basement. One day the daughter said, “I’ll go in the basement to get my doll” (because it was in there with a girl ghost), but only the mother knew about the ghost because she was the one that killed them! BOO!!!!!!!

===The Gnome===

The seniors of St. Charles high school's football team went out to party after winning the state championship. As is common with high school jocks, all of them had plenty of experience with alochol and pot. Deciding to make this night really memorable, they all tried acid for the first time. The four of them drove around town for several hours before pulling up to a dark shady house, with a funny looking lawn gnome on the front lawn. They decided to steal the gnome, but as soon as they got it in the car it started talking to them. All four boys were terrified of this gnome, and decided to throw it in the trunk of the car. When they got home, the gnome was still babbling incoherently. They left it in the trunk and crashed for the night. When they woke up, they found the body of a 4 year old [[Mike Sandy|black]] kid in their trunk.

===Teacher Teacher===

It was my first day at Red Tree Hills Middle school and me and my best friend Jade both had Miss Chalk as our english teacher. Miss Chalk wasn't horrible or anythig, but people said that she had a major problem with girls with braces. So on a monday in March, I got braces. I wasn't worried, but I should have been. 

As soon as I got to school the next day, a girl named Samantha walked up to me and told me that Miss Chalk was going to do something bad to me. I should have listened, but I didn't. 

SO I walked into class and Miss Chalk stared at me with a stare so great I could have fainted. And she turned around and melted. 

Seriously, she MELTED!!!

===Cheek to Cheek With Death===

Was trying to sleep, she felt something tickle her cheek. Someone was breathing on her, someone was right to her face but she could not move. She was in shock. Then it went away. When she woke up the next day, every person in the house was chopped up.

===House of Horrors===

One time I went into a haunted house. It was just pretend ghosts but then I saw a real ghost there. It was scary.

===Ghost War===

''Don't get me started on this, because I'm afraid they’ll get me. Don't tell anyone this but ghosts have come to go to war with the living. You will die. Sometimes you will, sometimes you won't. Death, blood everywhere you look. I was taken just hours ago, and soon I’ll take you!''

===The First Page===

Once, there was a boy who loved to read. He read everything he could get his hands on, and loved going to his favorite book store. One day, the boy realized he had read everything the store had to offer. He confronted the owner, and asked him if he had anything the boy had never checked out. The owner said why, yes, I do, and pulled out a book called “Death”. He gladly sold it to the boy at a discounted price of $50. However, he warned the boy, never to read the front page.

Well, the boy returned to his house and read the book, and he was content. However, he always wondered, what could be on that front page, it was always in the back of his mind. One day, the temptation was too much for the boy, and he flipped to the very front of the book, and dropped the book in HORROR.
There, in bold print, was MSRP $6.99.

===Hawaii 50===

One day, I was home alone. My parents had just bought a new house. I was watching TV. And all of a sudden, I heard a ghost walking through my kitchen. I quickly rolled under the couch. As I looked behind me I saw the said ghost! I got from under the couch and I ran into my room and I slammed my door. I picked up my cell phone and called 911. 
[[Image:Come_play_with_me_by_DaStafiZ.jpg|right|thumb|ZOMG i'm an artiste.]]

When I didn't know was another ghost was under my bed breathing very hard. I talked to a police officer and he said "I will be there in 3 2 1..." When he bust the door open, the ghosts were chasing me around the house. One of them bit my leg off and I screamed in horror. The police officer got his gun out and shot all of the evil ghosts. 

The next morning, My parents came back from vacation in Hawaii. They gave me the look as if I threw a house party. I shrugged my shoulders in discomfort. They looked at my injuries and took me to the hospital. On the way there, I told them the whole story. A few weeks later, my family and I moved out of the ghostly house and into a safe apartment.

===Ghost Van===
[[Image:Dinner Party.jpg|right|thumb]]

Once their was this man and his name was George. Every single kid in the neighborhood loved him because he was the ice cream man. He came around every single Friday night… nobody ever went out to eat on Fridays - Everybody stayed home. But one night he didn't come! The kids thought he was just confused and went to his house to tell him. They saw Mr. George, but he was dead. Nobody knew how he died. 

One Friday, all the kids where home and saw that Mr. George's van was coming around. They got confused and went outside to see who it was. Nobody was in the van! When it drove away, someone got in the drivers seat and said, "Poor Mr. George.” 

===What Lies Within===

Turn out the lights. All of them. Shut your now useless eyes and focus on silence. Once you have blurred the noise around you, look inside. look deep into your heart for something that is not you. When you find it, ask its name. If it does not respond say to it "This is MY body and I am king in it. You will speak." then ask again. Listen closely with ears you don't have to the voice you will hear faintly. Then pull it from its resting spot and fight it.

===The Visitor===

One night a girl was home all alone. She was drinking a glass of wine and watching TV and she decided to go upstairs and go to sleep. She got in bed and started to doze off when ALL OF A SUDDEN she heard a noise. She got up and went down stairs to see what it was. The noise eventually led to the kitchen. The kitchen had a really bad smell to it. She saw that the noise was coming from her oven, so she opened her oven AND HER MOM WAS INSIDE. She had been trying to get out of the oven the whole night. But it cooked her and she was dead and black person from where she got cooked. Then, she heard another noise. But this time..

It came from her room..

===Kola===

The Bay of Kola, off Murmansk, is a graveyard for old Soviet submarines, which spill nuclear waste out into the Barents Sea. Many a Western explorer has braved the subzero temperatures and biting tainted winds, but few have lived to tell the tale. The locals of Murmansk say that sometimes, when the wind is high and is dashing the grease-iced waves on the choppy waters of the bay, one can hear the voices of those who died as a result of boarding those submarines. The only problem is that only the strongest to go have ever survived, and each one of those surviving visitors to Kola dies within ten weeks of telling their story to the barman at Rokossovsky’s in Murmansk.

===The Skeleton Tree===

During the spring of 1902 in the Dry Tortugas Islands off of the coast of Key West, a man was shot and the bullet protruded slightly from the back of his skull into a tree (which he had his back against at the time). As time passed and the tree continued to grow, his putrefied corpse was lifted into the boughs as his skull was still attached loosely to the tree by the bullet. As time passed, the tree grew around the skeleton. If you can find this tree on one of the islands, tap it thrice with the heel of a cow hide leather boot, you will be granted the ability to make anyone forget anything at will.

===The Irishman===

One day, there was a man walking down a street. Yes, a street. He was wearing a plaid kilt, and really high socks. So anyway he was playing his bagpipe that I forgot to mention while I was explaining his physical attributes (like 90% of all 12 year old scary stories do) and he heard a strange noise... coming from his stomach. He said "Aie, that can't be good, I think I might have had a bit too many beans in that last batch of hummus!"
So, he started on his adventure to find a bathroom to take a ferocious, explosive, really bad smelling diarrhea dump into.
He went to the local crack house, but they only had urinals.
He checked all of the grocery stores... to no avail.
He even tried taking a dump in a garbage can in the Dollar Store... Nope, it was too high to take an atrocious, 3 foot wide spray radius, diarrhea dump into. After all, he didn't want to accidentally hose down half the store with molten shit.
So, he decided that he had to go to his neighbors house, to use their bathroom.. he got there, and it seemed like there was nobody home. Luckily, he knew where the key was hidden, so he put it in the doorknob, but since he was on the verge of bottoming out, he accidentally broke the key off in the lock.
At this point, he was desperate for a toilet to take a big stinky into, to he had to use a garbage can to get up to the 2nd story window.
He climbed into the window, and realized in horror that somebody was asleep in the bed in front of him.
He decided that since he already caused enough damage, he would just wake up the person to ask them where the bathroom was.
He tapped them on the shoulder, and realized it was a young African American girl! She screamed, and it scared the Irishman so badly that he let loose a waterfall of stinky, mostly brown diarrhea in his undies.
The Irishman saw a young African American man running towards him from the hallway, so he quickly ran to the bathroom to take off his undies and flush them... when he realized that the young boy meant buisness, the Irishman decided it was too late, and quickly jumped back out of the window where he entered.

The next day, on the local news, he saw the face of the young man... he was saying to "hide yo' kids, hide yo' wife, and hide yo' husband.. cause they rapin' EVERYBODY out here."


===House of Mirrors===

In the heart of Washington, there’s a house that used to be owned by a family of five. Nobody really knows what happened to them. Their neighbors at the time say that there were no signs of weirdness or fear in the family. The common testimony is that one day there was nothing wrong. The night that followed, there were very loud noises coming from the house, and although people in the area came to investigate what was keeping them up, the windows were blocked by millions of post-it notes, and the windows would not break. The following day, the house was empty. 

Nobody has lived in that house since. But people have gone inside. In every bedroom, there is a mirror facing the corner of the room. If you turn it around, it won’t show your reflection. The area you’ll be standing in will be empty. They say that on the rare occasion, you’ll see the person who used to sleep in that room, mutilated and bandaged from head to toe... 

===Annoying Med Student===

An unpopular young med student had been particularly annoying one day and some of her classmates decided to play a trick on her. They snuck into her room after she'd gone to bed and placed an amputated arm into bed with her. The next morning they anxiously awaited her reaction but got none. Eventually they went up to check on her and found her sitting on the bed, moaning and gurgling as she gnawed on the arm.

===Change For A Dollar===

The next time you make a purchase, hand the clerk a $1 bill and ask her to make change. She will hand you back a number of coins, several of which bear the likenesses of long dead historical figures.

===The Nine Inch Nails In-joke===

If, in this twilight of the world, you go back to the beginning of a pilgrimage on the Highway to La Mer, you will get sidetracked. Your dreams will fade, and your mind might become somewhat damaged. Eventually, you will enter a small town, that appears to be empty. When you ask aloud 'where is everybody' you will notice a 22.86cm long nail lying buried in a layer of frost in front of you. If you pick it up, you will notice that it appears to be broken. You'll see the fragments of it, but they won't fit. You really shouldn't give a shit. Holding the nail with your ring finger and thumb, make the tiniest little hole in the ground. Stay down on your knees. Wait. If all has gone well, you will feel yourself start to spiral downwards into the void; as you get closer to the great below, you will seem to be falling even deeper, into a warm place. If you can manage to look up, you will see the sunspots overhead, getting smaller. You can try to stop it, but it keeps on coming Eventually, after you've fallen all of the way down in it, you will arrive in an ocean of violet fluid. It will be the deepest shade of mushroom-blue. You will still be holding the nail. You'll smell stale incense and old sweat, and lies. A voice will echo out of the darkness, asking, "are you ready to meet your master?". If you answer yes, and it's a terrible lie, you will fall a short distance, and well, I hope you can find some sort of happiness in slavery. If you answer no, be prepared for the purest feeling of physical hurt, just like you imagined in your worst nightmares, but it will end with a quick, merciful release into death, from the burn of the march of the pigs. If you truthfully answer yes, you will be approached by a reptile-like man with a few dozen halos and a head like a hole, who will ask you one question; "would you bite the hand that feeds you?" If you answer; "with teeth." you will be justified, purified, and sanctified, inside yourself, and you'll receive several god-given powers, and told to deliver the warning. There will be a massive Quake. No matter how much you scream, "I do not want this!", nothing can stop you now. No matter how hard you try to save yourself, yourself will keep slipping away.You will have no choice; the mark has been made, and the world is closer to the big come down.You will feel something killing away all of your bad parts. You will have have become The Great Destroyer, the Eraser and the frail, the wretched, the fragile, all will bow to your will. The world will be ripe, (with decay.)

===The 13th===

If you use the Julian or the Gregorian calender beware: 

February of all the months of the year has only 28 days. Why so, is a question that crosses the mind once in a while, well... it is not a coincidence; it is a hint. If you take the extra days of the other months so that every month only has 28 days like February there will be enough days to creat a 13th month with... 28 days. Sure there is enough to have a month or two with 29 days, but there will be a 13th month in which you can have the 13th day of the 13th month. Good thing we have used a 12 month system for so long, because if it is the 13th day of the 13th month and you know it is that date: 'it' will happen. 

(Note: It IS possible to learn the existence when such a date) 

===Déjà Vu===

A déjà vu is actually a glitch in reality, and it indicates that something has just been changed. Someone or something has ceased to exist, all memories and records of their existence erased forever. A déjà vu happens when they get into your brain, when they need to change your memories.
Maybe to erase your brother from the world. You know, the brother that you never had.

Also there is no spoon.


===Cats===

The eyes of a cat are windows to your soul. They can see other dimensions, they can see your aura, and what's wrong with you.
A cat knows when you are happy, when you are in bad health, when you are troubled, or when you are hungry. He knows when you are feeling magnanimous, and he knows when you are about to die.

It's fortunate that cats can't talk, because you have a lot of secrets. The cat knows.

===The Raven Stone===

Out in the barrens of western Montana, there is a rock shaped like a raven's head with half of the beak broken off. If you use your forearm to complete the beak and hold the position for seven minutes and 26 seconds, you will feel a tingling sensation in your arm. You must then get at least 1 mile away from the rock within the next 66 seconds.

If you do this, you will be able to shape shift into any bird, at will.

If you begin the process and fail, you will turn into a crow and never be able to return to human form.

===Bodymore, Murderland=== 
  
Early in the morning of August 19, 2005, the body of a young black man approximately 16 or 17 years old was found on Wolfe Street, in downtown Baltimore. The corpse lay in a pool of blood, and was dressed in a pair of loose jean shorts over white cotton boxers, a Baltimore Ravens football jersey bearing the number 77 and the name Ortiz, a pair of white cotton athletic socks and a small gold cross on a chain around the body's neck. The body wore no shoes, and had no wallet or other identifying possessions. Baltimore City police concluded that the young man had been just another victim of the city's frequent violent crimes. Nobody came forth to claim or identify the body, and it was passed on to the coroner’s office for autopsy. The coroner’s report concluded that the cause of death was blood loss and trauma caused by three shots to the upper chest, one of which penetrated the heart and the other two the left lung.   
    
So far, so normal, right? Here’s the part the official statement left out: There were, indeed, three entry wounds, but there were no exit wounds, and after a thorough search of the body no slugs or fragments were found, nor was there any heat damage. The young man had been killed by three shots to the chest, but there were never any bullets. The body was never identified.   
    
Postscript: As of this writing, the Baltimore Ravens have never had a player who sported the number 77, or who was named Ortiz

===The Deep===

The Ocean has claimed many lives over the years. Traders, sailors, airmen...the list goes on. 

A boy was riding the ferry to the Scilly Isles, 30 miles off the south-west corner of England. The sea was choppy, and he felt sick. He leaned over the side, sensing that he was about to throw up. Instead, he was horrified to see that the gray water was full of white corpses, some in uniforms, which stared up at him with pure white eyes. Horrified, the boy got up and turned to his parents. 

They were the same as the people in the water, and so was everyone else on board. The ship stopped just as the boy ran to the the bridge. Everyone on board regarded him with dead eyes. As the ship gracefully slipped beneath the waves, the boy realized that the Deep was claiming its tax on humanity. 

===The Change===

Somewhere in West Philadelphia , you will find an old basketball court with a single ball lying in the middle. Pick it up and start shooting hoops. After a while, a small group of hooligans will approach you and challenge you to a fight, which you must accept.

After the fight, you must go home and relay the events to your mother. She will then inform you that you have an aunt and uncle living in one of the districts of Los Angeles, and out of fear, she will send you to live there for an indefinite period of time.

With your bags packed, go to the street corner, and whistle for a cab. The cab that will pull up will bear the word FRESH on the license plate, and upon closer inspection, novelty fuzzy dice will hang in the mirror. Although you will suddenly realize that cabs like these are extremely hard to find, do not bear any thought to it. At this point you MUST point out in front of the car and say 'Yo homes to Bel Air'. You will stop in front of a mansion, and it will be sometime between 7 and 8 o'clock, even though it will feel like you've been traveling mere seconds. Get your luggage out and say 'Yo homes, smell ya later!', but do NOT turn back to face the cabby. Walk up to the door, look over your shoulder once, and then knock on the door three times.

If you follow these instructions, your life will get flip-turned upside-down.

===The Sculptor===

There once was a master sculptor who prospered in a strict, but respected art school. He was excellent in his craft, quickly surpassing the skill of his master and that of his fellow pupils. However, he was too good at his trade, and grew bored after just a few sculptures. They were masterpieces, each perfectly designed and executed, but to the sculptor, they were just plain and simple. He wanted something ''more'', something ''new'', something ''different''. He started to experiment with new techniques and different substances, but was discouraged from doing so by his envious artistic peers. He had still been able to make masterpieces, unlike any the world had known before. However, in doing so, he had violated many art laws, which his peers took very seriously. But he didn't listen to them, so they destroyed his statues and exiled him. Then they brought him to a manhole which lead to a sewer and said, "Here is your new workspace! Let's see you work with this!" And they threw him in.

The sculptor looked around. They had sealed him inside the sewer. What was he going to do? He couldn't live here. Covered in grime and sludge and muck, he realized that he would die here, dirty, alone, and unappreciated. Determined to make one last sculpture, he needed a subject. "I'm going to die here," he thought. "So I might as well leave a record of my existence." And so the sculptor decided upon a subject: himself. Now all he needed was a material, but what was there down here that he could use? Looking at his filthy hands, he figured it would be useless trying to stay clean, so he looked around to see a potential material with which to sculpt.

Splat, splish, splash.

The sculptor turned toward this curious noise. It was human excrement. He was in a sanitary sewer. As this was the only thing there, he began to collect it and sculpt. He found that it was actually the best substance he had ever worked with. The sculptor worked for hours on end, without food or water, and finished his self-sculpture, and signed it, proving his existence. However, he collapsed of exhaustion in the process. Laying in the waste of what quite possibly could be that of his former art peers', he died, longing to work more with this newly discovered substance.

It is said that his ghost still wanders the sewers of the world, traveling through sewage pipes to collect the materials that he so desires. However, out of his hatred for his jealous art peers, he creates only the most horrific-looking sculptures. He will go so far to gather excrement that he will go to your very own toilet, the moment you sit down, sticking his hand just under your bottom with a bag to collect your bowel movements. If you try to look at it, it will disappear before you are able to notice it, and if you get constipated and make him impatient, he will remove your bowels for you. However, if he still does not extract them, he will drag you through the sewers to his workplace, where he will show you his terrible sculptures. They'll scare the shit out of you.

===The Terrible Bastard of Death===

So one time, right, there was this big, I mean seriously big apartment building, mainly used for student housing. Anyway, in the middle of the day, on some day other than October 31, the students in room 65 get a phone call.

"There's a new student going to be moving in next to you," says the voice on the other end. They ask who it is, no answer. But sure enough, the next day, there's boxes of stuff outside the room next to theirs. They hear movement and footsteps, but every time they go out, y'know, to introduce themselves, there's nobody there.

Coupla weeks pass, right? And they start forgetting about it. There's no new car in the parking lot, and nobody new on the bus to college. But then it starts to smell. Not just their corridor, not just their floor, the whole apartment block starts smelling of bad eggs and rotting meat. And when they're going to or from their apartment, they notice some weird liquid trickling under the door of the room next to theirs.

But everyone buys some air freshener, and they start forgetting about it again. But then the screaming starts, in the middle of the night. Screams of horror, sounding really close by. They try putting on some music, but after a few nights, the lack of sleep starts really fucking them up. So they knock on their unseen neighbor's door, to try and get them to shut up; no answer. They look through the keyhole. If it was red, they'd've been worried, they've heard all the stories, but no, they can see through fine, and it's just a normal-looking apartment, basically the same as theirs.

Next day there's a body in the parking lot behind the building. It's clearly been thrown from high up.

'Why does our bastard neighbour have to do all this fucking shit?' asks one of them, looking out the window at the body. 'He's acting like a fucking nut!'

'At least it distracts everyone from our murdering,' replies another, forcing some mangled flesh into the food disposal.

===Homeless Man===

Somewhere in New York City there is an old homeless man missing both his legs from the knees down, whose spot along the streets is the corner of Lexington and East 21st, near Gramercy Park. Approach him after nightfall, give him some change (NO pennies, NO dimes) and ask him, "What did you see on the other side?" He will then tell you all about his travels to other realms and times, where he lost his legs, how he lost his money. 

It is up to you whether to believe him or not, but as you listen you'll find yourself being drawn in with every story. You must stay alert, or the old man will notice your inattentiveness, and with a scowl he will stop imparting his wisdom; he will chase you as fast as he can, tottering on his stubs. The other reason why you must stay alert is to check the time. Before midnight you must interrupt him (do NOT let him finish whatever story he's telling you at the moment) and say "I've heard enough, old man. Good day and good luck", then walk away. 

Make at least two left-hand turns around the block before going about your business. You must do this, because anyone who has stayed to listen past midnight is never seen again, at least not in this particular plane of existence.

===Don't Follow Me===

I was at my friends in the attic (messing around like kids do) when we found an old gameboy cartridge.. instantly my friends went

===Just an Ordinary Couple===

A couple was walking across the road one day. The boy said “Sarah could you tit your head back”. Sarah replied “Why”. To which the boy replied “BECAUSE I’M A VAMPIRE”.


===Your Last Breath===

It's there - just at the veil of sleep. That dull sensation of falling or spinning just before you fall to sleep. The next time you go to bed, try to hold yourself there. Just as you drift off, hold onto that feeling. Hold on, and listen. Listen close, for you cannot hold onto that edge of sleep for long. There, in the space before sleep, is a sound: a gentle hum, a distant echo; like a sigh in a brick building. Listen well, and remember that sound. That is the sound of your last breath.
===The Pretty Cake Room===

On Friday the 13th, find a steel door and paint an inverted crucifix on it with lamb's blood; then knock.  Put your ear to the door, and listen; within 30 seconds, you should hear someone ask, "Who sent you?" to which you must reply, "Brian Peppers."  (If you hear anything else, or something you can't quite make out, or hear nothing within 30 seconds, turn in a clockwise direction to face the south, and yell "BUM DARTS" at the top of your lungs; then quickly leave.)  The door will then open in the opposite direction its hinges go, revealing a stunning white light, which will fade in 3.14 seconds.  If you are timely in stepping over the threshold, you will find yourself standing in a kitchen with no doors or windows; even the door you came through will be gone, replaced by a wall.  In the kitchen there will be an oven, cupboards stuffed with ingredients, and cooking implements laid neatly on a wooden prep table, along with an open cookbook.  The most important thing is the cookbook.  You must do the cooking by the book.  Flip to the recipe named "Pretty Cake," if not there already (under no circumstances use the one with the title "Messy Recipe").  Do exactly as the cookbook instructs, following its directions to the letter.  A song will be playing loudly, repetitively, to remind you of the importance of following the cookbook, and reassuring you that it's a piece of cake.  If you are successful, you will have a cake.  If you fail, you will have to eat what comes out of the oven; whatever it is will not be pretty, or in any way resemble a cake.  Before you are released from this room, two conditions must be met:  The thing you have made must be completely eaten, and everything must be restored to the exact state it was in when you got there.  If anything is the smallest atom out of place, you will be denied exit.  The song also never stops playing.

===Zach and Meghan===

Hellooooooooooooooo rang a voice in the forest. Whhhwhat do you want yelled Zach. It's just me said his girlfriend Megan. Oh I knew that... then she started to fade...... ZACH!!! She yelled as she dissapeared. Whwhwhat's happening yelled Zach! Then he saw it. It was a creature in the tree moaning. Zach looked up and screamed, then he mustered up the courage and then he asked whwhat are your giant eyes for? Tooooo look through and through. What are your giant claws for? said Zach seeming frightened. Toooo scratch your grave!! and whwhwhwhat are your giant teeth for? said Zach almost whispering. Then the thing replied TO CHOMP YOUR BONES!!!! Zach started running and when he was in a clearing he looked back and he saw his house. So he ran inside and there were three things 2 graves in the yard and the monster. Zach screamed so loudly he died. THE END?

===Kylie Rose===

One day, a little girl named Kylie Rose went to the toy store for her birthday present. She chose a blue stuffed animal elephant with pink dots. She brought it home and put it in her closet with her other stuffed animals. 

That night, at 3 in the morning, Snuffy was sitting on her bed holding up 1 finger. That's weird, she thought, I put Snuffy in the closet. 

The next night, at 2 in the morning, Snuffy was back on her bed holding up 2 fingers. Kylie was annoyed. 

The next night, at 1 in the morning, Snuffy crawled up behind her, winked at her, and held up 3 fingers. And killed her. 

P.S. (The 1,2, and 3 fingers means one life up, 2 lives up, and three lives up.) 

I know because I am Kylie Rose!!

===Bitten===

One night, the most scariest night of them all, I went out for a walk. Something bit me. I screamed. There was something out there, but only I know because that very night I turned into a vampire

=== Episode 66 ===

{{bigtext|Can anyone help me out here? I'm looking for a lost episode of the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog

I'm sure some of you remember, if you're from the northern part of Virginia, and watched The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog you may have seen this. Some back story first, I saw this when I was eight when I first recall seeing this episode, the number of the said [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770807/ episode is 66 of season one] (there was only one season) and was only aired in northern Virginia as the broadcasting station had ignored the notice not to play the final episode of the bundle due to its extreme adult content. This was the stations choice as it had purchased the syndication rights in its area but was later sued by concerned parents after several children were diagnosed of light neural hemorrhaging causing severe nightmares and vomiting. Nobody was killed by viewing this episode and older viewers seemed immune to the effects of whatever caused the bleeding, but needless to say a freeze was put on the production of the series and was hushed up on the news, the show was replaced by the series named simply Sonic the Hedgehog.

I started my search for the episode after the nightmares from watching watching the show returned after 16 years. The nightmare was vivid, it contained vision of people in a long line all of them clutching their faces in despair. The people in this line spread the full length of the street and had seemingly abandoned their cars (leaving the doors open) to join the others waiting. Everyone was deathly thin, naked and when they spoke they did so in what sounded like reverse tongues but not much was said in between the helpless sobs. Everything had a dark red tone to it, like the sun was burning out at sunset but never fully went down. Those that where not in the line littered the street, dead. I can't recall much from the dream other than that, some other details hinted at looting, things like a line of dead riot police and smashed windows, upturned cars and even a collapsed skyscraper in the distance but those in the line payed no attention to this, they simply sobbed as the line shifted forward. The nightmare ends with one of the members of the line looking directly at me, he says nothing but shifts to an unnatural pose, his arms bent at 45 degree angles and his legs spread into a box over the ground, his mouth agape as he did this the rest of the people in the line did the same, striking a slightly different twisted pose all looking at me. I then awoke with tears in my eyes.

My first logical step to finding this lost episode was the station which originally aired it. There is nothing odd about the station, it's old management has long since moved on, committed suicide as the new manager pointed out to me. Over a cup of coffee me and the new manager discussed the stations past I intentionally eased into the subject lost episode and as it turned out i was right to do so. When I brought up the subject John (is he will now be known), the manager literally spilled his coffee on his lap.
He told me that this subject was a personal one to him and as it turns out John was the original owners son. He was kind enough to explain to me that the legal fees he was receiving in conjunction with the mail he was receiving from children and parents alike had pushed him too far and he hung himself in the family kitchen. I was a little taken back by this news so I figured maybe I was digging too deep and decided to drop this madness and just call it a day, but before I could exit John's office he told me that he would send me the mail, his reasoning... That he wanted me to know what happened, his curiosity was almost as deep as mine, not surprising considering this episode killed his father. So I told him I'll take a look deeper into the subject and get back to him on anything I dig up.

The letters where as you would expect, angry mothers asking what kind of station would air this filth, legal fees ranging in the hundreds of thousands of dollars (enough to send any station broke in the 90's) and of course drawing from children depicting scenes from the episode. Distinct things like the blood and the unusually dull colors that persisted throughout the episode. Horrible things, things like [[PINGAS|Robotnik]] vomiting blood and tails crying over the corpse of feathered headless bird. But one letter caught my attention specifically, it was a letter from the studio which produced the series:
"Thank you for purchasing the rights to air Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (c) Sega 1993-1994 all rights reserved, enclosed is the series list, episode descriptions, Episodes 1-66 the entirety of season 1 and legal information regarding ratings and air times."
In poor hand writing, at the bottom of the page a scrawled note was placed with the words "Episode 66 is not to be aired! This is a database error and contains corrupted material". The initials JS followed.

I set out to find this episode, but to no avail. My second plan was to ask the people who sent the angry letters about the episode about their take on it. Those who had not moved away since then gave me canned "I don't know" or "Not this again" responses but I did chance upon one man, around my age who remembers and taped the episode he invited me in and showed me his VHS copy of the episode, it was badly decayed from years of neglect in his garage though and the only bits I could make out was Tails screaming at Sonic, with tears in his eyes
"How could you Sonic? What have you done!?"and the rest of the episode on the tape was just static, the occasional scream and twisted figures, not animals or people but figures staring at viewer, their circular mouths and open black eyes emitting a slight screech. The tape sent chills up out spine and I asked if I could take the tape for research I was doing into the episode he agreed quite readily and I promised to keep him updated, as well as John.

I took the tape back to John and we watched it up to about 15 minutes where John just jumped back in his seat. He told me he saw the figure with black eyes, but it spoke for brief moment, John claimed he its lips moved, mouthing the word he though was "eternity" we watched that same one second flash for what must have been thirty times and each time we both attempted to freeze the frame on the figure only to have it disappear when we did so. I called it a day there, we needed a better copy of this episode if we where to find out why this episode ended the entire series and caused me nightmares for much of my childhood.

Short of traveling to France and talking to the animation studio, I gave them a call. The bluntly told me that there was no episode 66 and that 65 was the full season. Knowing this dead end I called again for another phone and asked for the contact information of the voice actors. All of the information was out of date it seemed, the actors for Robotnik, Scratch, Grounder and sonic all giving me "Number not in service" errors however I did manage to contact Christopher Evan Welch (The voice of tails) and hook him for a fake interview about his roles in 90's Television. Chris turned up as you would expect, casual clothing smile on his face, your average guy in his late 20's. As he sat down I asked about some of his roles in bands and television and worked my way to Sonic. When I did get there however he got really quite, and evasive. I asked him specifically about episode 66 and halfway through taking a breath he just stopped. His pupils almost retracted into nothing and he looked at me and told me that the episodes only go up to 65. Of course I knew better and asked him about his script talking to sonic and what he had done. He grabbed his face, not in frustration but to wipe back his eyes which were begging to well up. He took a deep breath and told me the episode was written by Jeffrey Scott, he told me the usual that he was always a nice man and was very patient with him as he read the script (Being 11 at the time) but as the first season drew to a close Jeffrey had become very angry with everyone, including 11 year old Chris. The voice actor for Robotnik and Sonic threatened to quit over his behavior but the executive producer paid them both large sums of cash in hand right there to read from the script Jeffrey had written. Apparently Jeffrey had an order from high up, the top of Sega or as far as Chris knew at the time to produce this episode, listed as a business priority.

Chris explained to me how as they read the script he felt great sorrow and terror, as if they had lost a close friend of family member or had seen them die before them, he told me of the scarring to his vocal chords from the screaming that was invoked by reading the script he told me of the blood that leaked from the mouths of the actors of Robotnik and Sonic. The session ended with the security pulling the actors from the studio before they died in the process of recording from blood loss. His mother pulled him from the show the next day, fearing for his safety. I stopped the interview there, I asked for a copy of the episode but a copy was never sent back to the actors.

That is as far as I have come in the Search for episode 66 I've heard that there may be a copy in the studio in France but I no way of getting their on my budget. But I know it exists and I know many more out there must have a VHS copy, so this is why I ask the Internet. Help me in my search.|1000|200}}
