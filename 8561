When in the course of human events, it becomes abundantly clear that your computer has fucked up royally, is generally not making any sense, is going slower than something that goes really, really slow, telling you about all those silly runtime errors and is generally '''(Not Responding)''' a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation of the computer plug from the wall and throw it out the window, letting it fall onto the head of some unsuspecting passerby. Ouch.

Before you engage in negligent manslaughter or worse, maybe you should take some time to engage in some '''basic troubleshooting'''.

==Easy Solutions==

;''Is your computer running?''
:If the answer is '''yes''', you'd better catch it.
:If the answer is '''no''', try turning it on.

;''Your computer isn't coming on.''
:I '''fail''' to understand how this is any of my concern.

;''Is your computer plugged in?''
:If the answer is '''yes''', please unplug the computer and throw it out the window, letting it fall on the head of some unsuspecting passerby.
:If the answer is '''no''', plug in your computer.

;''Is your monitor turned on?''
:If the answer is '''yes''', please take a shotgun, load and cock the firearm, aim it at the general direction of the screen and discharge the shell into your screen.
:If the answer is '''no''', press the on/off button.

;''You have pressed the on/off button and it still does not work.''
:'''Yeah''', what's your point?

;''How do you make it work?''
: Jesus Christ, '''don't get so uptight'''. Okay...

;''Have you plugged in the monitor?''
:If the answer is '''yes''', turn to page [[42]].
:If the answer is '''no''', plug in your monitor and press the on/off button.

;''You stand in a cave with a great green burdleblatt. You are armed with a sword and nothing else in your inventory. What do you do?
:If the answer is '''Attack''', roll the green die.
:if the answer is '''Magic''', you suck because you have no magic.
:If the answer is '''Escape''', you cannot, due to the fact that you are in a cave.
:If the answer is '''WTF?''', go onto the next question.

;''Sorry about that.''
:'''Okay''', don't let it happen again.

;''Is your monitor plugged up to your computer?''
:If the answer is '''yes''', cast "magic missile".
:If the answer is '''no''', plug in your monitor.
:If the answer is '''GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING SON OF A BITCH IN A HANDBASKET WITH WHORES!''', quit your goddamn whining and answer the question.

;''Turn on your computer.''

;''Has it loaded yet?''
:If the answer is '''no''', keep waiting.

;''Mind if I run and get a snack?''
:If the answer is '''yes''', Great! What do you want?
:If the answer is '''no''', Great! What do you want?
:If the answer is '''Go get a big cup of STFU''', watch your mouth. I don't have to do this.

;''No, really. What do you want?''
: >Hookers and Blow.

;''He runs into the kitchen. Minutes later, you hear from the kitchen "I don't see any Hookers and/or blow! How about an energy drink?"''
: >Take drink

; ''The drink is in the kitchen!''
: >Goto kitchen

; ''I don't understand "Goto".''
: >Kitchen

; ''You stand in your kitchen. A horrible stench comes from the sink because you haven't washed dishes in about a month. You have only been living there a week. All the cabinets are open. An energy drink is on the counter.''
: >take drink

; ''You take the drink and return to the computer. Windows still has not loaded.''
: >Sip drink. 

; ''The drink was poisoned. You're dead. Not 3 seconds later, I steal your computer. Your score was 2 out of 3. Not bad.''
: >Get the strategy guide.
