North Carolina vandal
{{potential}}

'''North Carolina vandal''' is the [[TOW]]-chosen term for a [[redneck]] hoaxer who spammed retarded nonsense on to North Carolina-related articles, although he was repeatedly [[pwned]] by [[Curps]]bot. He was also known for spamming Carlow Crab on to many wikis, meaning he may be the original inventor of that [[STD]]. He was fought by hippy child fucker Antandrus, Curpsbot, a [[fat dyke]] named Joy Stovall and various other [[wikipedo]]s.

==About the NCV==
North Carolina Vandal is in fact a cheap, badly made rip-off of [[Willy on Wheels]]. His vandalism was for the most part either [[uncyclopedia|unfunny]] or [[illogicopedia|really unfunny]]. Occasionally, it was [[wickerpedia|suicidally unfunny]].

==Where's he gone?==
Contrary to popular belief, the NCV still [[lurk]]s somewhere in the deep, dark holes of the [[internet]]. He was last seen a month or so ago on Code WIKI, a [[editthis.info|poor excuse for a website]] about that glorious show called [[Rule 34|Code: Lyoko]], and written by a bunch of [[13 year old boys|19 year old boys]] who think the epitome of 'cool' is watching a poorly produced [[Gay|French]] pseudo-[[hentai|anime]] show. NCV's recent spam involves either [[Raep|Abusive]] [[Australia|Aussie]] [[Pervert|Husbands]] or some [[Family Guy|unfunny bullshit]] about a fictional [[webcomic]] called "Reidsville Adventures", mostly posted on [[Yuri|Kim Possible]] [[Wikia]], under the user name [[3guys1hammer|Three Guys, One Hammer]]. Additionally he owns several wikis himself, notably the srsly gay [http://www.editthis.info/rvawiki RVAWiki] that [[shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about]].
