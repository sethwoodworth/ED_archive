On Saturday September 8th ''Wired'' Magazine's Loretta Hidalgo Whiteside had called for a new NASA slogan. Of course the <s> brilliant</s> massive mistake was made to use the internet to gather public input on what the new slogan should be.
Once the brave [[anon|freedom fighters]] of the internet got wind of this news, they immediately fucked Wired magazines shit entirely up. The sounds of [[F5]] keys being repeatedly slapped could be heard any where kissless virgins had access to internets.
