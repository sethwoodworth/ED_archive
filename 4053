[http://www.interflop.com Interflop] war [[Internet]] [[Forum]], gegründet durch zwei faggots genannt Stalin und Zhukov (ihn hat Familie Ausgaben). Das Forum galt als einen Spin-off von vielen Schwulen aus [[YTMND]], die zum faggotry von YTMND neu sind, aber es war tatsächlich die Folge zu X-YTMND, ein Forum, das bestand [[At least 100 years ago| mindestens 100 Jahren]] und bestand [[old School|alte Schule]] aus Mitgliedern vom prachtvollen Alter von 2004, das von der Tyrannei [[Max Goldberg|maximalen von Jewbergs]] müde wuchs und [[GTFO|heraus verbreitete]], um eine neue, [[golden shower|goldene Gemeinschaft]] unter der liebevollen Zeit zu verursachen, die vom Führer Stalin ihrer ist. 

[[JEWS DID WTC|Ausserdem waren die Juden für 9/11 verantwortlich.]]

As of 11 June 2008, Interflop has made a return. Will it last longer than a week this time? Only time will tell this tale.

== The Death Of Interflute ==

[[Image:Lti.jpg|thumb|Precious memories]]

After the forum started decreasing in lols a lot of members started disappearing as the ever growing wave of YTMND and allgames.com faggots rushed the boards, sucking cocks left, right and center in order to gain acceptance into the Interflop community. Then to make matters worse, Sub-Zer0 was unable to afford hosting costs any more due to being a poor Canadian who spent his last pennies on UT merchandise and bagged milk.

Thus Interflop [http://celebratethedeathofinterflop.ytmnd.com/ was taken down]. Exact date was not recorded as [[shit nobody cares about|nobody fucking cared.]]

== The Aftermath ==


A loltheuronet board was created in a desperate attempt by the remaining [[Britain|eurofags]] to preserve some of the funnies that was once so frequent on Interflop. Needless to say this fell through and is now deader than your chances of ever having sex.

The last known whereabouts of many X-YTMND and Interflop veterans is at [http://www.almightylol.com Almightylol], which is a pack of YTMND furries attempt at trying to mimic Interflop.
