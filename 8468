Buffalo Bill celebrity impersonator '''Tonetta777''' is a [[Youtube]] musician/[[Mechanophilia|sex machine]] who tickled and delighted hipsters' [[Irony#Hipster_Irony|irony]] organs with his [[trap|drag queen review]].  [[Nazi|Youtube moderators]] became threatened by his talent and sex appeal and have long since [http://www.youtube.com/user/tonetta777 suspended his main account.]  The suspension did not go unnoticed by PBR-swilling types (unlike [[Natalee Holloway|so]] [[Iraq|many]] [[Polish Lollercaust|other]] [[Obamacare|things]]), and they have since been pining and [http://www.petitiononline.com/tonetta/petition.html petitioning] for his official return.

Tonetta humbles himself before his fawning fan base over [http://www.lolokaust.com/tonetta.html here] in a one-on-one with some useless manchild, rejecting The [[Weblog|Vlog]] in order to keep the sanctity of his channel, and embracing the ageless art of [[Chris Hansen|The Interview]].  In the interview he casually name drops John Lennon as an occasional inspiration, though given their respective ages and levels of musical expertise, it may be more accurate to say [[Fact|Tonetta777 influenced John Lennon]].


==Tonetta, The Music==

These tasty tunes were saved by the few, proud [[Sock puppet|bastions of good taste]] and sanity left on Youtube.  They are likely viewable on all the "deleted youtube video" aggregates as well, amidst a sea of embarrassed neckbeards and bouncing [[16-year-old girl]]s
