[22:52:21] * Mori sets mode: +M
[22:52:22] * Mori changes topic to 'channel #arbhcat is not for people that have used legal threats. This includes Jamie Baillie.�'
[22:52:31] <@Mori> i hope that was the right M
[22:52:32] <@Mori> anyway
[22:52:37] <PunaKone> lol no
[22:52:37] <@Mori> defense please present your case
[22:52:39] <+redsportscar321> i wasn't vandalizing per se i was only removing 1 sentence and 1 picture that had my user name in it and nothing more
[22:52:47] * Mori sets mode: -M
[22:52:50] * Mori sets mode: +m
[22:53:07] <+BlackMist> what you belive is vandalzing is just mere editing
[22:53:09] <+BURK> and what is your username?
[22:53:12] <@Mori> that still counts as vandalism
[22:53:28] <+BURK> what were the contents of the sentance removed and the picture?
[22:53:32] <+redsportscar321> redsportscar321 is my username on youtube, the mentioned one in the article
[22:53:37] <@Mori> also burkums let the dude present his case in peace
[22:53:40] <+BlackMist> if my client had put in a bunch of swears and imature jokes it would be considered vandalism
[22:53:57] <+BURK> ok ok just let me know when i can rip his sphincter
[22:53:58] <+BlackMist> but one line means almost nothing in an entire article
[22:54:00] <@Mori> so what is it that you want
[22:54:14] <+redsportscar321> 1st of all it said :  User:redsportscar321 IS TRYING TO VANDALIZE THIS PAGE RIGHT NOW!Plz undo all this users edits on this page  
[22:54:41] <+redsportscar321> 2ndly:FangXXV is suspected to be a front for another GE320 fantard redsportscar321,A moron who thinks that if he stuffs his pale face with pocky sticks and jerks off to Bleach and Transformers,he will become an asian. 
[22:54:44] <+BlackMist> just a samll template change to his user page will suffice
[22:55:14] <+redsportscar321> lastly:Redsportscar321,token azn may be the lulzkiller's accomplice FangXXV.
[22:55:24] <+redsportscar321> that's all i edited
[22:55:41] <@Mori> so why did you make these changes?
[22:56:04] -> *Mori* we want to know the defendants age
