Standing Cat
Looking for meme you can send to [[your mom]]? Look no further! '''Standing Cat''' is a video which was uploaded to [[YouTube]] by [http://www.youtube.com/user/DaisYannou DaisYannou] in November [[2009]]. The video shows, quite simply, a cat named Rocky standing on his hind legs peering out at something outside the window and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1tv6W4OaV0 'Cats on Mars' by Yoko Kanno] playing in the background. 

Whilst there are plenty of videos of cats standing up on the [[internets]], this particular video somehow managed to strike a chord and its popularity (and view count...) is on a steady rise.
