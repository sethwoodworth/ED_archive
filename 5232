[[wapanese|Weeaboos.]]

They have invaded our internetz. Desensitized our very way of life while ramming down [[cock|Pocky]] like a two cent [[azn|Vietnamese]] whore. While all of them deserve nothing more than a swift [[Falcon Punch|power-fist]] to the cunt, Matsu-sensei requires some [[over 9000|extra]] dosages. The [[woman|man]] isn't nearly as confused as some of our other sweet, sweet [[Tartlet|lul cows]], but he's still as ass backwards as they come. His existence is full of [[lulz|controversy]] and [[fail|confusion]]. Sometimes you just gotta [[internet tough guy|man up]] and admit you wish you had a [[cunt|box]]


== Origins of Fail ==

Matsu-sensei is an [[lie|amazing artist]] on DeviantART who claims to have [[lie|superb]] [[shit|skillz]] and win on the internets. While everyone CLEARLY knows this is [[bullshit|100% true in all respects]], he is as close-minded as the [[fetish|fetishists]] he speaks out against, such as [[fat|Blue-Leader]] and [[CattyN|other nefarious deities]]. He is currently attempting to secretly run the course of [[Snapesnogger]] via the usage of large, [[boobs|cancerous tumors]] to spread his ways, in an eerily similar way to how the Third Reich was started. Heil, mein [[dick|chesties]]?

===In the Beginning...===

It is rumored that he began life not as an actual baby, but merely crawled his way out of [[Goatse|a cavernous pit]] [[basement dweller|as a pathetic shell of life]]. It did not take long to home in on a target, though: A [[16-year-old|little, busty schoolgirl]]. Mouth dripping with saliva, he reached forth like a powerful leech, sucking her chest and soul dry like a milkshake, soon fully growing into an [[Wapanese|awesome]] [[faggot|man]]. Realizing his true potential to [[rape|rule the internet]] with promises of his power, he sought to defy physics and gravity upon a normal basis, hypnotizing weaklings like himself to establish a [[retards|fanbase]] of [[faggotry|pure win.]]

===Here and Now===

At this point in time, our Bringer of Breasts is [[serious business]]. However, unlike most of our favorite celebrities here on ED, Matsu seems to be actually [[bullshit|TRYING]] to present himself with a different image (we can seeeeeeee it from the sweat on his [[gay|powerful illustrations]]) by [[ms paint|drawing]] up not only [http://matsu-sensei.deviantart.com/art/Kare-for-a-game-of-sport-85868507 furries] from his favorite show, but also how he sees characters from Team Fortress 2. However, if [http://matsu-sensei.deviantart.com/art/The-Spice-of-Life-84356013 this] is any hint on where he's taking this, it is terrifying to see what he will [[rape|bless]] the [[gay|Pyro]] with his [[dick|touch]].

[[Image:Graphite_Eternity_pg1_by_Matsu_sensei.jpg|thumb|HEY GUYZ. I CAN HAS HUMOR NAO?]]

== As Creative as a Block of Wood ==

He seems to be obsessed with breasts, and more breasts (possibly a side of bacon). That's pretty much it. Some have attempted to question his antics, but have fallen prey to [[rape|unknown means,]] never to be seen again. In the rare occasion he believes to [[IMMA_CHARGIN_MAH_LAZER|sit down and recharge]], he attempts to draw [[shitty|witty and timeless ]] [http://matsu-sensei.deviantart.com/art/LOL-HLEP-LOL-84116869 memes] believing it will bring about much [[lie|humor]]. So far his fanbase has gobbled it up, deluding him into believing he will soon be able to create a new [[scientology|religion]] based on his love of breasts and bacon. While [[fail|lulzy]] at best, the threat he could have upon the tubes is very [[bullshit|serious]], potentially greasing them up with [[basement dweller|fanboi]] sweat and [[semen|bacon grease]] to literally make us all [[retards|dribbling]], obese slaves for him to [[rape|mesmerize]].

Along with his unending desire for tumors, he appears to have a [[obvious|sekrit]] transgender fetish in the form of one of his characters, [http://matsu-sensei.deviantart.com/art/Authorized-Personnel-Only-33820725 Mattie] (Ha ha, they'll nevah know it's me. [[original_character|OC]] guyz, [[amirite]]?)

==Sekrit fetishes==

'''Transgender? Lordy, PLEASE. :D'''

As was stated before, he seems to have a "secret" transgender fetish which is apparent in his multiple drawings in which he depicts a female version of himself, going so far as to making [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/4/4d/Change.gif animated avatars]  about how he would wish for it to happen. (now in [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/7/74/Change3.gif 125x125 forum size,] and [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Change1.5.gif 80x80 too!])

It is rumored he hates other transgenders, flying into an unholy state of [[rage]] whenever encountering one, or merely creating complex schemez to hide his ideals... but fear not! We at ED have brought you a public "explanation" along with a little surprise.

<gallery>Image:FAQ_Mattie_by_Matsu_sensei.jpg|So subtle, good sir...
Image:Mm(1).jpg|...but how do you explain this?

'''I can has BE too?'''

He also has a BE fetish, but anyone can see that from his sight. The [[truth|obvious]] need not be stated, considering the insane amount of mind-boggling chest sizes on his site along with being a prominent member at a fetish website called [http://www.process-productions.com/forum/index.php The Process Forum] (having TWO accounts!).

'''We can have [[delicious flat chest]]s as well!'''

While not technically an OPEN fetish, it's rumored that all of his actions are attempts to hide the most secret fetish of all: His true desire to [[buttsex|sex up another man.]] People have yet to find a trace of actual evidence to support this claim other than the heavy influence of reverse psychology, but it is only a manner of time before the poor lad cracks and shows himself. Moar [[DFC]] prz!!

== It's okay to not be yourself!... wait a minute... ==

===Denial of interests===

He appears to have a hatred for his own kind, but when confronted about being one himself... well, we can't have [[logic]] stand in the way of our appearance! Oh noez guys, he has an ACTUAL JAPANESE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. Say what? O.O

Of course! As such, he has any and all excuses to use whatever [[desu|kawaii neko desu]] references he pleases and receive no negative feedback whatsoever! Good show lad, [[lie|that'll show them!]]

Along with [[denial]] of his lower status, he has attempted to excuse himself from his love of growing tumors by throwing whatever [[bullshit]] reasons his bacon-encrusted head can muster.

Image:CAP1.PNG|'cause it's not in what you do, but why you did it.
Image:Speakforyourself.PNG|Let's think with bewbs and jump to conclusions, eh?

===Denial of Relations===

[[Image:Tibia Bon Para.jpg|thumb|ROTS! Come with me to my bed, and let us be [[azn]] together!!]]

The man seems tight-assed to all whenever inquiries are brought up, but after some digging, we have found the beautiful sight of him [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/17609859/691899430 proclaiming his love] to another... isn't that adorable? Matsu has found a friend in our wonderful Internet Bible Thumber, [[Realm-Of-The-Shadows]]!!

Don't the two seem to be such a [[gay|cute]] couple? The wedding will likely happen sometime later in the year at their pace, so keep your calenders clean and your gifts handy! It'll be a [[fail|stupendous]] union we haven't seen since Britney Spears had her (insert # here) husband!

Drop on by his site and be sure to [[troll|spread the love! :D]]
