==History==

'''Epic Fail Kid''' is the [[retard|unwanted]] <s>bastard son</s> deviation of [[Epic Fail Guy]]. He is usually seen wearing the [[V|same mask]] as his father, embarrassed by his failed dad's actions, and hopeful no one will recognise him, although he himself failed many times already. He is known to be [[rape|molested]] by his own [[CP|father repeatedly]].

==Epic Fail Kid Sex Theory==
Face it, you [[faggot]]! If [[Epic Fail Guy]] can father a kid, then even a [[basement dweller]] such as yourself can get laid. So get out of [[your mom|your mom's]] basement and start fulfilling your [[Sex|evolutionary purpose]], you fucking fail bucket!
