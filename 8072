<br>[[Teenspot]] is essentially a [[MySpace]]-lite social networking site centered around its [http://www.teenspot.com/boards/ main forum] and [http://www.teenspot.com/chat/ chat rooms]. It's ''"da place 2 b"''  for those who have been [[b&|rejected]] by the [[Tom Anderson|Tom]], but couldn't make it to [[Facebook]]. Its user base consists of various cliques of [[cam whore]]s, [[faggot]]s, [[emo]]s, [[pedophiles|older guys seeking younger girls]], and other miscellaneous, lonely people who have no [[IRL]] friends.

==Why do they go to TeenSpot?==
[[Image:Teenspotadvice.jpg|thumb|Cutting advice.]]
Most herd to TeenSpot to:

*Bitch about how their parents didn't let them go to the movies on Friday night.

*Seek advice for tragic [[Pwned|break-ups]].

*[[homo|Announce their faggotry]] and actively seek buttsecks throughout the forums and chat rooms.

*Ask how to have [[sex]] properly (i.e. Which hole to put it in), only to return a day afterwards to make "Am I pregnant?" threads.

*To share videos of themselves masturbating and licking their own juices off their fingers in the case of BrooklynneSTFU..

*Whore for the attention of [[pedo|pedo's]] and [[puberty|hormonal juiced teens]] to boost their low [[self_esteem|self esteem]].

*[[Teenspot#Culture|Discuss and display their master artworks]] of [http://www.teenspot.com/boards/forumdisplay.html?f=52 poetry], [http://www.teenspot.com/boards/showthread.html?t=426941 traditionally drawn anime], [http://www.teenspot.com/boards/showthread.html?t=428499 professionally composed/ intentionally over-contrasted photographs], and their [http://www.teenspot.com/boards/showthread.html?t=404002 expert digital art skills].

*<s>Discuss and analyze politics</s> Talk about how George Bush ''"si a sucky moron americen idiot doofus"''.

*[http://www.teenspot.com/chat/ Cyber fuck] in the Chat Rooms and exchange fake nudes.

*[http://www.teenspot.com/boards/forumdisplay.html?f=46 Talk about Degrassi, High School Musical 2, and Donnie Darko].

==Chat Rooms==
The chat rooms are teenspot's pride and glory (fuck the forums). Thanks largely in part to deep-cover [[Anonymous]], the knowledge of the workings of the chat rooms has been greatly expanded.  It is currently believed to be the most effectively exploitable area of Teenspot, with the potential for [[epic]] [[lulz]].

===Channels/Rooms===
There are twenty-nine public channels on teenspot and a couple hidden ones such as #911 or the much fabled #private-roleplay. As of 2011, most of its channels are dead save for a few, included in the rooms mentioned below. 

'''#Singles''' and '''#GayLesBi''' are teenspot's highest trafficked rooms, with well over 600 and 100 users at peak hours, respectively. The majority of these users are, sadly, [[Pedobear|pedophiles]] pretending to be all sorts of fucked up things, who believe that the best way to capture someones attention is to spam in [[ALL CAPS]] and very bright colors about how big their penis is--"PM me for RP ladies"--using the exact same format as everyone else, because apparently [[loli]]s find originality to be repugnant.  Although only mildly distracting when one person is doing it, often there are 20 or more faggots spamming this shit twenty-four hours a day--most of them already previously banned [[over 9000]] times--never stopping even when brentOn tells them they're about to be hammered and makes good on it. Most of the chatrooms can be trolled easily, simply change your text pink and say that you're "[[loli|13/F/US]]", be warned though, if this method abused, your computer may crash from the slew of "asl plzz?" reply messages. Needless to say, these rooms are useless for chatting and mostly just serve as pedo-magnets to keep the other rooms relatively clean, and to give TS more hits on Google.

'''There is no intelligence on teenspot'''. Let me explain. First the obvious: ''anyone with a brain is not wasting their youth on teenspot''. So what is this entity on teenspot that we mistake for intelligence? It is quite simply: the measure of ones level of withdrawal from IRL society. With that in mind, you may continue reading.

Teenspot has seen better days. In 2006, teenspot's intelligence was abundant and could be found in most rooms between '''#Advice''' and '''#Flirt''', and between '''#Roleplay''' and '''#Zone'''. ...love to the glory days of '''#Cafe''', '''#Dorm''', the '''#Trivia''' triplets, and hell, even '''#Party'''. But now, the calendar year is 2011, and each of those rooms has been long dead--the old regulars banned, moved on or proven fake. Only the most intelligent of TSers remain. Ironically, they congregate in '''#Hottub'''--a room with a storied reputation for housing retards. Nevertheless, #Hottub is now inhabited by the same old [[retards|people]] who [[lie|Type. With. Proper. Grammar.]] and tear anyone, who [[Aspie|doesn't consistently kiss the ass of at least one other chatter]], a new asshole. This makes for great trolling, as you can get an entire room filled with [[insane|sensible]] people to focus all of their attention on your text just by telling 'viperazuredragon453' that he/she/it is a [[newbie|'n00b!1']]. tyler(the admin responsible for the roleplaying rooms) is generally gone in the late morning and early afternoon hours, so feel free to express your hatred of [[Niggers|black people]] then. He also happens to be a druggie, and take part in conversations about [[bullshit|all of the hard shit he does]] to get over his last girlfriend/cat dying/whatever the actual reason is. 

TeenSpot's chatrooms are run though ChatSpace by Akiva, an IRC based java program.  Therefore, many [[IRC]] commands are allowed, such as /whois, /notice, /watch, /profile, and /action, most of which necessary to the pedophiles in order to better track down the [[loli]].  <s>TeenSpot's chatrooms have been known to be accessed through [[IRC]] by spoofing the chat client if [[you]] are 1ee+ enough to do so.  Direct access requires a password, which has yet to be discovered.  One such exploit of this has been automatic private advertising spam to anyone who enters a room- potentially devastating if, say, twenty [[Anonymous]] had a mind to do this.</s> Spoofing is now next to impossible as, due to rampant abuse, the site's [[faggots|owners and administators]] decided to place [[leet|1337]] protection on it. Blame mike for being a black person and focus on trolling the old fashioned way.

For those moralfags out there, you can actually report pedophiles to the admins while you're trolling.  Just type /notice #911 followed by a copy of the evidence (or just make shit up if you don't like someone).  The two most common who WILL NOT GO AWAY are:
A forty year-old who always registers the name older male and claims to be "HO RNY".
A guy in his thirties who usually posts something to the effect of "ANY GIRLS 11-16 LIKE SEX PARTIES WITH OLDER GUYS 4 REAL".  This guy wants to rape your little sister.  4 real.

Of the known chat [[fag|admins]], only brentOn, Mark and <s>bran</s> (permab&; the poor old bastard could not keep himself away from [http://www.teenspot.com/profiles/mindy the underage pussy]) are on often enough to be considered [[lulzkiller]]s.  Check the room you're in for them; if they're not there, you're essentially in the clear, except for the room bot which will silence then kick for long text or excessive flooding. Usually the admins take [[job|long periods of absence]] which are marked by [[gay|l33t]] text next to their names(lol irc). During these periods, you're also pretty much clear off, as the logs produced on TeenSpot are XBOX hueg and impossible to check. Of the censored words, anyone running Windows XP can evade it by using non-ASCII letters.  The censor is now twofold. Whenever a censored word is used and you get a red warning, the word doesn't appear in the room, and entire post goes to a room monitored by admins, who review and often IP ban if the context warrants it.  Mention how much you hate Dick Cheney and you're fine for instance.  Whenever a censored word is used in Singles specifically otherwise, you either get banned instantly or silenced, both by a script running through mike's name (which means when he's offline or you're chatting privately those things fly).  Context doesn't matter, if you talk about past experiences with a chicken farm the wrong way you're toast.  Since that censor focuses on evasions of words you probably won't say anyway, you probably can pretty much do anything if you're not stupid about it.  If not, rotate your IP address, troll better, and get back to it half a minute later because as the site proudly proclaims, "registering is free and easy!".

===Where legacies are made===
Our legacy--the defining moment of our lives, the triumphs for which we are remembered: the "I Have a Dream" speech by Martin Luther King Jr. or the discovery of America by Amerigo Vespucci. Unfortunately, however, to others these are the moments for which we are mocked for the rest our lives. Take superstar athlete LeBron James' "The Decision," or Tiger Woods' "entrepreneurship". And hey, while we're at it, why not enjoy some of our fellow teenspot chat-regulars' finest hours?

==Picture rating==
[[Image:Ratebackfactor.jpg|thumb|The "rate back factor" formula.]]
[[Image:Ratebackinaction.jpg|thumb|The "rate back factor" in action.]]
The second most popular forum on Teenspot is [http://www.teenspot.com/boards/forumdisplay.html?f=131 picture rating], which provides equal amounts of lulz as it does [[fap|fapping material]]. The mindset of those seeking picture ratings is explained:


{{quote|[[Fox_News|some say]] those seeking a rating out of 10 are in constant need of approval from others. They are attention seeking, self-promoting, egotistical teenage whores, oblivious to the fact that they are really just embarrassing themselves by begging people, whom they do not know, to rate them on a heavily inflated system primarily used to keep their self-esteem from dropping to dangerously low levels, thus preventing their ego from imploding... It's physics, or something.|[[Scientist|Dr. Scientist]]}}
Most of ratings (seemingly) defy logic, and oftentimes many [[ugly|beastly]], facial-herpes-ridden, [[Aids|AIDS-filled]] fuckdicks are rated above the norm. The reason for this is the recently discovered '''[rb]''', or '''[rate back]''' factor.

===Rate Back factor===
This is the x-factor in which the raters then become the ratees. After giving a TeenSpot user a rate, they post ''"rb"'' in a thread where they just gave a 9.67/10 only to expect a 9.68/10 in return.


==Eleven Dirty Words==
[[Image:TSrestrictedusernames.jpg|thumb|FuckYeahSeaking is serious business.]]

If you can't resist using dirty words on TeenSpot, don't worry, because they've probably already decided what you can't say. But, in case you want to try and move around their selective restrictions, or you are a [[newfag]] worried about being [[Banhammer|b&]], here's a list for clarification:

You '''can''' also talk about porn, being raped/ wanting to rape someone, suicide, masturbation, how big your dick is, anal sex and rim jobs, abortions, etc. Posting here is one giant paradoxical, oxymoronic [[mindfuck|mindfuck]]... Some [[Loose Change|conspiracy theorists]] would be quick to blame the jews for this nonsense, but considering Jew is an uncensored word that's allowed to be [[troll|used on the forums]], some speculate that there must be a [[Al Sharpton|darker force (literally)]] behind this...

Statisticians have hypothesized that only 0.1% of the TeenSpot population has '''not''' been [[rape|raped]]. Those who have been, however, have, apparently, not been traumatized enough by the occurrence, and feel comfortable enough (to the point of enjoyment) to tell everyone on the [[internets|interbutts]] about it. One event in particular, which sparked a lolcano on ([http://dis.4chan.org/read/lounge/1186986103 4chan's /lounge/] and [http://forum.ebaumsworld.com/showthread.php?t=218292 Ebaums]) is a '''Rape worthy''' post made on TeenSpot on August 13, 2007.

{{quote|Tears
They pierce my heart
Like a thousand shards of glass
Pain courses though my veins
Like a familiar friend that I have come to know

Tears of Judgment
Flow down my face and forms into a dark pool
All I see are the people who judge me
Piercing eyes stare back at me
There thoughts collected in my mind and never escapes

Tears of Sadness
Icy cold
Like a merciless winter snow
Freezes over my burning heart
Little by little coldness consumes my soul

Tears of Hope
Are the bright blinding lights of the future
For a single moment
Tears heal my wounds with hope
But hope soon fades into the darkness of pain|[[Emo|Poetry by Kaffine1217]]}}
