'''Darl McBride''' is CEO of [[SCO]].  Darl McBride is also evil.  He is trying to destroy [[Linux]] by suing IBM, pissing on the [[GPL]], and repeatedly [[rape|raping]] [[Pamela Jones]].  He is also proof that Unix is officially dead.  Darl hopes to make megacash by proving that IBM acted in bad faith by siphoning code from [[Project Monterrey]] into Linux.

Last quarter, SCO only made $200,000 in revenues, confirming fears that if SCO does not succeed in their case against IBM, they are down the tubes.  And it is all Darl McBride's fault.

This guy is also the biggest [[faggot]] on the planet and should be [[killed with fire]].
