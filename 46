[[Image:90s flowchart.jpg|thumb|Flowchart of the '90s.]]

The '''1990s''' is a decade that took place from 1993 to 2003 and is currently being bent over and [[raped]] with nostalgia by crazy [[16-year-old girls]] as if it happened [[at least 100 years ago]].

The '90s is famous for [[Mexico]] winning its independence from famed rapist John Striker and for [[Kurt Cobain]] becoming [[An hero|an Guitar Hero]].
