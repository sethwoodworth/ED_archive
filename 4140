Ismail Ax Lyrics
"I didn't have to do this.

I could have left.

I could have fled.

But no, I will no longer [[An Hero|run]]."


<chorus>

My name is [[Cho Seung-hui]]

They die behind my steps

The rich, they pay in [[blood]]

We cast aside our chains


Oppressed and [[rape]]d for centuries

Enslavement in disguise

United under Ismail's banner

Now my legions rise

</chorus>


"It's not for me. For my [[child]]ren,

for my brothers and sisters that you [[fuck]],

[I did it for them...]

When the time came, I did it.

I had to."


<chorus/>


"This is it, this is where it all [[suicide|end]]s

End of the road

What a life it was

Some life"



<chorus/>


Generations to come

Shall remember my name

I shot them for you

I died not in vain


<chorus/>
