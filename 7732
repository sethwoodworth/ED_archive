Spellcheck

[[File:Loctated.png|thumb|Or not.]]
[[God]]'s gift to the illiterate masses. The [[Spellcheck]] can make one look like an aristocratic [[fuck]], while in reality the individual in question (ie. [[YOU]]) is just another [[13 year old boy]]- you know, the kind they sell on the streets in [[Russia]].

If one fails to use a spellchecking program on [[teh]] [[Internets|intarwebz]], the [[grammar nazi]]s will remorselessly tear your pitiful post to shreds. This can result in you being banished from the [[Internets|internets]] due to the [[lulz]] created, and, in severe cases, [[suicide|self hurt]].

==How Spellcheck Works==

Ok, so let's say you're writing an article about James A. Garfield, our fantastic, friendly [[fat|fat fuck]] of a president from [[at least 100]] presidents ago.  You might, for whatever reason, want to use the adjective "Garfieldian." (Remember!  An adjective is a word that describes ''another'' word!)

Since word processing programmers are generally too busy enjoying [[hookers and blow|the finer things in life]], the dictionary they include with their program is typically a [[cuntpaste]] job from [[urban dictionary|some lesser source of words]].

Needless to say, they have no idea what the fuck "Garfieldian" means, except being a [[Garfield|fat orange tabby with a lasagna fetish]].

So, you finally finish your [[tl;dr|30-page dissertation]] on our finest president ever and you're ready to check it for errors.  Oops!  Looks like [[Microsoft|Word 97]] doesn't know what "Garfieldian" means.   It will sometimes give you a list of other words to choose from, such as "Garden" or "Golf."  But not this time.  There is absolutely nothing under the Word 97 sun that rhymes with "Garfieldian."  So you click '''ignore''' and the spellcheck moves on to other creative word combos you've managed to create.

But after that's over, that red squiggly "oops you fucked up!" line appears under "Garfieldian" again.  Guess it's not being ignored anymore.  So you right click on it, and it tells you again that there are no words it could possibly be. So you say to yourself, to [[hell]] with that!, and just delete the word.  But then a ''green'' squiggly line appears, which means you can't write in some ancient form of [[Engrish]] that Word 97 found to be most appropriate for modern-day [[AOL]] users.

And now you're just frustrated.  It's four in the morning, [[your mom]] is eating all your cookies, and you've just been kicked from [[bantown]] for being a prick.  It's time to call it a day.  So you print out your shit, shove it in your trendy [[Hot Topic]] messenger bag and go to sleep.

Of course, you wake up at three in the afternoon the next day and you missed your lecture.  Your humorless professor will never take a late paper because his [[LiveJournal]] was [[troll]]ed by people like you and now he has an axe to grind.  Now you get to drop out of school and become a sexless, pasty-faced [[basement dweller]] because you stayed up too late fucking around with spellcheck and made-up words like "Garfieldian." I hope you're fucking happy.
