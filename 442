Anarchists (LiveJournal community)
Although the stereotype of '''anarchists''' on the [[Internets]] is that they're all [[16 year old girl|16 year old]] [[Hot Topic]] [[punk]]s and [[scenester]]s, the [[LiveJournal]] community {{ljcomm|user=anarchists}} paints a different picture of them. It's full of humourless, pompous, and disagreeable people who [[masturbation|debate anarchist theory]] [[tl;dr|for paragraphs]] on end and brag about all of the charity work they've done, making anarchists really more like a cross between [[Trekkies]] and the [[pedophilia|Boy Scouts]].

There was recent drama when arch-anarchist [[faggot]] [[Nevin Zehr]] accidentally unleashed his [[troll]] friends on the community. They [[spam]]med it with pictures of [[tubgirl]] and [[Republican|mutilated anuses]]. Some members of the community wanted to [[fascism|appoint moderators]] and make it a closed [[community]]. Zehr tried to point out the irony of this, but thanks to a brilliant [[Internet Detective]], it was revealed that he wasn't a [[IRL|real]] Anarchist, but in fact a troll sympathizer! He was then put in anarchist jail (where he enjoyed the rough [[anal sex|anal rape]]) and the day was saved.
