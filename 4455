==Introduction==

[[Bogan|Justin "Mully" Williams]] was a drunken [[bogan]] who became intoxicated, stole a car and wiped out a family. Soon after the tragic incident, the media blamed police for Justin killing the family.  [[Fucktard|Supporters]] of Justin defended him, saying such stupid things as ''"What would you do if you were scared like that?"'', to which anon replied ''"Stop.  Derp Derp!"''. Lulz ensued soon after the incident when /b/tards launched a full scale attack on the memorial group made for Justin.

==Epic Facebook Butthurt==

After /b/ launched a raid on the facebook memorial page dedicated to Justin, a new admin appeared and [[butthurt|banned everyone]] from accessing the memorial page.  The raid was headed by a /b/tard using the sockpuppet Jack Assington, who caused much lulz.  The /b/ trolls continuously trolled the page for roughly three hours, successfully pissing off anyone who cared about [[an hero|Justin "Mully" Williams]]. Massive damage was cause by the seemingly endless stream of troll's, let us not forget the countless Troll Facebook accounts that were reported and b&.

==Deb the Admin==

At around 4:50 AM Eastern time (yes, it's ALSO 04:50 for all of you eurofags and azns), an [[fat whore|admin]] by the name of Deb reached critical mass levels of [[butthurt|butthurt]] and v& all who were trolling, hid the group, and ate sour cream with an ice cream scoop while crying quietly to herself.
Deb still is in control of the page, which is still MIA as of Monday, March 22, 2010.  Unfortunately anon has not hacked her as of yet, which will lead to incredible levels of [[Lulz|lulz]] if it's accomplished.

==Afterlife==

Justin spends most of his afterlife looking at different vehicles he could drive if he was still living. The vehicle of choice he looks at are known as "Holdens". Holdens are essentially rust bucket pieces of shit that [[bogans|hoons]] use due to being able to acquire parts cheaply. We must remember Mully for all the good times, he is "having a beer in heaven 4 us mate" and is a [[murderer|TOP FUCKING BLOKE.]]
