[[image:X_copy.jpg|thumb|the results of trying to discuss [[IRL]] on /x/.]]
[[Image:Wetrwerwer.png|thumb|Typical /x/ thread]]


'''/x/''' is [[4chan]]'s paranormal board. Moot originally created /x/ so that the [[neckbeard]]s would have a place for [[SNCA|thoughtful debate regarding alleged supernatural]]. Naturally, [[/b/]]tards and other assorted [[faggotry|fags]] have turned /x/ into a place to post vaguely-frightening [[shoop]]ed images, [[Tentacle rape|Cthulhu porn]], and [[over 9,000]] [[zombie]] threads that succeed at being neither funny nor scary.
It is also one of the easiest boards to troll as it is mainly inhabited by 14 year old fat goths with [[Assburgers]].

/x/ is also one of several 4chan boards raided by /b/ when the [[4chan.js|colored boxes]] roll into town.



==Inhabitants==

[[image:xtards.jpg|thumb]]

On any given day, /x/ is composed of the following types, or "/x/philes".

# /b/tards who have had their souls crushed by five years of pain series and raids, looking for a way to convince themselves that there is still something interesting, mysterious or magical about the world.
# Would-be [[otherkin]] and [[pagan]]s trying to convince themselves that they are [[special|mysterious or magical]].
# [[Role-playing|Role-players]], who are either [[otherkin]], [[troll]]s, or just [[batshit]] insane.
# Trolls feeding them bullshit to see how big a fool they are prepared to make of themselves.
# Attention-whoring [[tripfag]]s posting good [[original content]] and then RUINING FOR EVERYONE by admitting that it's just prose.
# [[Retard]]s so desperate for some level of [[mystery]] that they take all [[original content]] [[serious business|really fucking seriously]] and refuse to believe that it's fiction.
# [[Faggot]]s who either fap to [[cthulhu|H.P. Lovecraft]] or [[uncyclopedia|anything mentioning zombies.]]
# Admitted otherkin seeking [[hugbox|moar of their kind]].

==Memes and Content==

===[[Mindfuck]] Threads===

{{quote|I decided to browse /x/ to get so scared that it would be mindfucking...

...after having seen this topic it got so mindfucked that it is scary.

My brain shit bricks and my anus hurts.|[[Anonymous|Butthurt /x/phile]]}}

Also known as the "When you see it, you'll shit bricks" meme, although /x/ has adopted the respelling "Bri/x/" as its own. These threads are theoretically composed of a visually complicated picture containing a suddenly shocking hidden element.

The breakdown of pictures posted to a Mindfuck thread usually breaks down as follows.

* 80% totally innocuous images, like a ''Where's Waldo'' with no Waldo.
* 15% real mindfucks that are either lame or so well known that everyone has seen them [[at least 100]] times.
* 5% [[Screamer]]s.

There is no way to countertroll a screamer, as drawing attention to it is an admission to being caught. It is, however, possible to use the top category to one's advantage by pretending to have "Got it" and posting something along the lines of "OH MAN, IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME BUT BRI/X/ WERE SHAT."

An even more effective method is to draw a red circle over a completely random part of the picture in MS Paint and then re-post it. People will genuinely go nuts trying to see a face.

===[[Creepypasta]] Threads===

Anons take turns to tell ghost stories. ''[[The Holders]]'' series is a perennial favorite, and is frequently added to or modified.

[[Image:Fap.jpg|thumb|right|/x/'s relationship with Junji Ito, in a nutshell.]]

===Horror [[Manga]] Thread===

Usually features the work of Junji Ito. The most popular are Uzumaki and ''[[Amigara|The Enigma Of Amigara Fault]]''.

===Reptilian Humanoids===

Threads devoted to the notion that [[Truthism.com|reptilian creatures are secretly controlling the world]]. Given that even 4chan draw the line at this one, it is perhaps a measure of [[TOW]]'s credibility that they allowed an article on this subject.

[[Image:Strider.jpg|thumb|right|A nightmarish and terrifying Forest Strider.]]

===Striders===

Nothing to do with ''[[Half-Life]]'', instead discussions of gigantic long-legged forest quadrupeds. Some /x/philes claim to have seen them in the mountainous forest areas of America. Discounting the fact that these creatures would be unable to get up if they fell over (or probably even feed), even though giraffes do it all the time. Obviously nothing to do with untaxed distilling equipment said to exist in above locales.

===Night Creatures===

The creatures that dwell beyond this veil of reality, which are only visible to humans when they take steps to strip away the layers of preconception and safety from their minds by going several days without sleep. Good job, 4chan, you figured out that sleep deprivation makes you see some crazy shit.


[[Image:Ghosts.jpg|thumb|right|When /b/ is down (i.e. every fucking day), this in every thread]]

===Suicidemouse.avi===
A [[creepypasta]] video which tumbled from the bowels of [[x/|/x/]]. It is supposedly a tape with [[Mickey Mouse]] from the 30's walking down a sidewalk with the same six buildings in the background repeating like on the Flintstones. The [[music]] is just the [[random]] banging of the piano. It then goes [[black]]. On the sixth minute, it shows mickey still walking down the same way, but the music has changed to a murmur of no known [[language]] that is equally as disturbing as the piano. Mickey then shows a smirk, then the sidewalk moves in a way that is [[Vandalize Every Equation|physically impossible]]. On the 7th minute, the murmur turned into a scream. Mickeys face began to fall apart, his eyes rolled on the bottom of his chin. The buildings became rubble floating in midair and the sidewalk was still impossibly navigating in warped directions. It all goes black and there is a phrase in [[Russian]] that says when translated, "the sights of hell bring its viewers back in." 
Note that 7:06 is equivalent to 6 minutes and 66 seconds.

==The Last Refuge Of The /b/tard==

Depending on the severity of DDOS attacks against /b/, the social research alliance which resides there will occasionally stampede over to /x/; partially to try [[science]] on it, and partially to have somewhere to go to get out of the rain.

During these periods, trolling will increase exponentially. One such example is the picture on the right, but equally acceptible is to simply make an image in [[MSPaint]] which consists of the text '''"NOBODY WILL EVER BELIEVE YOU"''' and post it next to any claim of paranormal experience (particularly if OP is being at all serious, heartfelt or traumatised about their ordeal).

When they defend themselves, repost the picture. And again. And again.

After doing this about ten times the [[butthurt]] gets incredible.

==The Twilight Challenge==
Another advanced trolling tactic is the [[Twilight]] Challenge. The challenge is simple: See how long it takes for a [[serious]] [[vampire]] thread on /x/ to turn into a total shitstorm of [[retard|retardation]] and [[RAGE|pants-shitting]]. The steps are as follows:

# Go to [[Google|Google Image search]].
# Find a vampire picture worthy of some [[goth]] [[fag|fag's]] [[DeviantArt]] (In a pinch, just use a picture of [[Bad Vlad|Vlad]] Tepes).
# Post said picture, asking a 100% [[troll|serious]] vampire question. Don't be too [[fail|obvious]]. Some good choices are those such as "Do you think [[batshit insane|Anne Rice]] ruined vampires?" or "What ever happened to the [[bestiality|bestial]] vampires of [[Bayeux Tapestry|old]]?" Anything that makes you sound like the [[fan fiction|type of guy]] who actually still has hope that vampires could be [[never|cool]].
# See how long it takes before someone (not [[you]]) mentions [[Twilight]] or posts a picture of [[pedophile|Edward Cullen]]. Bonus points if they [[grammar nazi|misspell]] it as "Twighlight." The shorter the time, the better.
# [[?|????]]
# [[Profit]]!

[[image:Edward Cullen Get Twilight.png|thumb|Only 2 minutes. Not bad.]]

The challenge is done. Did you beat your best time? Regardless, now you don't even need to post again to enjoy the fruits of your labor ([[Srsly]]). Just watch /x/ slowly troll itself into a frenzy of [[sage|sages]] and [[BAWWW|cries]] of "reported!" Since /x/ is [[slowpoke|slow]] on most nights, your thread will be on page 1 for hours, where /x/philes will continuously roll around in your [[shit]] and still whine about it. As a bonus, since you asked a [[troll|serious question]], you won't even get [[b&|banned]], unless you did join in the [[lulz|trolling]], that is. (Not that anyone's been banned for trolling /x/ in [[at least 100 years ago|forever]] anyway.

==E/x/odus==

Despite numerous attempts to ignore, repel, or otherwise deter /b/ from claiming /x/, the [[manchildren|citizens]] were outnumbered, and like a paper tent in a shitstorm, completely overwhelmed by children who couldn't keep up with /b/.  A plan was proposed, and enacted, whereby the last remaining faithful would split off and join other groups on other boards, most of which promptly failed, leaving the wanderers with no hope but to face real life, get a job and admit that the [[necronomicon|necronomicon]] isn't real.

==The Five Million Get==
[[File:JamieTheFiveMillionGetKid.jpg|thumb]]
On July 13, 2010, at approx. 5:27am CST, /x/'s Five Million Get was reached by a pubescent male by the name of Jamie. Jamie was modest in his victory though, gratiously thanking his $120,000 PC, Google chrome(It's fast as shit), and his mother for buying him the PC. All of /x/ promptly shat brix.
