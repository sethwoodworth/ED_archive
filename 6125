'''PETA''', or "People for the [[rimming|Eating]] of Tasty [[Goatse|Animals]]," "[[Pedophiles]] for the Engaging in [[Terrorism]] for [[Animals]]," "Poorly Educated [[Nobody Cares|Teen Activists]]", as well as "People for the [[Yiff|Emphatic]] [[Torture]] of Animals," is a [[Terrorist]] [[Cult|Organization]] created in the [[G.R.I.D.S.|'80s]] by a crazy [[bulldyke]] named [[Fucktard|Ingrid Newkirk]] and her [[Sick_Fuck|sick fucks]], with the twin goals of torturing innocent veal ranchers and [[pwn]]ing rich people by spray-painting peace signs on their (PETA's, notthe rich people's) endangered species [[fursuit|fur coats]].  Unfortunately, the goal was not precious [[lulz]], but to stop people from eating meat and wearing fur, making these would-be excellent [[Trolling IRL|IRL trolls]] just a bunch of [[Hippy|hippies]] with a lame cause, much like [[Project Chanology]]. In general, PETA <strike>attempts</strike> [[fail]]s to convince people that [[you must eat it|delicious]] animals are [[a cat is fine too|people too]]. But any fucktard knows that animals aren't humans, and most animal would eat or enslave us if they could, they're just too fucking [[fail]]. PETA is slowly becoming the number one cause of faggotry in the US. [[Kill it with fire]].

The entire organization is currently [[over 9000|$100 million]] in debt, and is only kept in existence by [[Satan|Satanic]] influence. In other words, they strive to be the most prominent [[IRL troll|activist organization]] in [[ZA WARUDO|the world]], as well as to "save" all the animals in the world so they can [[yiff|butt-rape]] them themselves. [http://Peta2.deviantart.com/ They even have a deviantART page]. Go on, [[rape|you know what to do with it]]. [http://http://streetteam.peta2.com/public/folder_view.cfm?pageid=341&option=view_topics&actionid=531/ Don't forget the Peta2 boards.]

==Diets==
[[Image:Eat three animals.jpg|thumb|Use this to troll PETA faggots.]]
[[Image:Faf-sticker.gif|thumb|[[Sea Kittens|Some friends]] are more delicious than others.]]

Unsurprisingly, PETA supports [[vegans]] but not [[vegetarians|vegefags]] because consuming dairy, fish, eggs, honey, or gelatin [[bullshit|means]] that [[fursecution|you support]] the [[Rape|enslavement]] of [[Furries|animals]]. You are also forbidden to wear leather and fur, but it's okay to wear imitation leather and faux fur. If an animal skin is second hand and unpaid for, it's good to go by vegan standards, as is anything purchased prior to 'the conversion', never mind that you would still be perpetuating the [[fetish|style]], and therefore, the demand for real leather and fur.

There are artificially synthesized variations of sugars, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, fats, flavorings, amino acids, proteins and many other essential dietary components, that have been produced without denying any form of life the right to exist, available from the chemical industry. PETA does not use these as substitutes for raeping plant and fungal life on a daily basis.

==[http://www.meat.org/ Meet Your Meat] (available on peta TV)==

This video is considered one of the gold standards for upsetting the public with regards to how meat is commercially raised and handled at slaughter. If you handn't been informed about it here, your first contact with it would likely have been when some arrogant vegan with a lot of money to spend on alternatives and time to source them handed you it's web address on a flyer. It graphically depicts the details involved for the processing of various different meats. Needless to say, it makes the baby jesus cry.

Someone wishing to speak with an informed opinion when confronting a peta would be wise to watch this video. They would also benefit from jewtubing every video on animal slaughter. What they will begin to notice is that not only are a lot of these videos relatively old, there aren't that many and some even include scenes that are found within others. It should become clear to the educated EDiot after viewing some of the more humane slaughtering videos that peta has either not visited that many slaughter houses or has doctored the footage to show only those with terrible track records. Evidenced by how little unique material there is available on what they suggest to be the normal way every slaughter house operates and the lack of more humane operations taking place in modern, inspected houses. This lack of quantity and variation in the content is quite remarkable for a group of fuckwits who'll put so much effort into terrorizing or assaulting staff, and their families, for so much as delivering supplies to companies handling animals.

There are, however, a number of equally gaping [[pussy]] meat eaters who refuse to watch this video. If that's [[you]], [[fail|YOU'RE BOTH FAIL, NO PRESENTS FOR ANYONE!]]

==[http://www.meat.org/ Chew on my Chewbacca] (also available via peta TV)==

Chew On This! (cross your arms and point when saying this to be [[leet]]) is a newer attempt by peta to highlight the downsides of eating meat. They begin by discussing the important issue of heart attacks; for which they use two points to make what is effectively one point. 

This rapidly descends to telling you meat makes you fat (something which is incorrect based on the biochemistry of digestion), that there is literally shit in prepackaged chicken, that meat is "filthy and bloody" (but vegetables covered in shit, piss, soil ridden with insects, fungi and harmful bacteria aren't the same we can assume - which they eat raw) and that it makes your main drain vein soft (the last vegan this [[EDiot]] met hadn't ever had sex, and [[epic fail|had his only chance to get some stolen from him by his 'friend', a carnivore]]).

Things go from bad to worse as the points simply become a list of personal opinions. Of coarse, these are not without [[irony|the ironics]] when they begin discussing threatening or harming other beings, given their approaches to those involved in these industries.

Point number 10 is of special merit, as this is the same video footage used in the Meet Your Meat video of a cow they show when discussing cancerous growths, which now has BSE as well; or perhaps neither.

If you have read the section above and watched Meat Your Meet, you will immediately recognize the same scenes being used. peta, with their tomes of evidence on systematic animal cruelty, are still recycling videos that look a decade or more out of date. In fact, the majority of the scenes used in this new bit of [[propaganda|propashite]] are [[copypasta]].

==Famous Trolling Escapades==
===Jesus was a [[vegetarian|vegefag]]===

One of PETA's earlier trolling escapades was their 1999 "[[Jesus]] was a vegetarian" campaign. PETA claimed that Jesus lived a natural, homeopathic life, eating vegetables and rejecting animal sacrifice. Hey, neat idea for a campaign! Except [[Fail|it's not fucking true]]. According to the Bible, Jesus ate fish and meat on several occasions. A more appropriate stock character would be Hitler, who actually was a vegetarian, but I guess "Hitler was a vegetarian" doesn't sound as appealing.

==="Got beer?" campaign===

In 2000, PETA launched their "Got [[Alcohol|Beer]]?" campaign, where they encouraged college students to drink beer instead of milk. PETA even claimed that [[Fact|beer is healthier than milk]] in their effort to prevent harming cows and their precious [[tits|udders]] (but did they "fight" to get them cows hammered 24/7? Noooo!). They even sent out promotional [[Mechanophile|bottle openers]] with the slogan "Drink Responsibly. Don't Drink Milk." 

Predictably, pretty much everybody [[lulz|lol'd]] at the idea that liver-damaging, brain-killing beer was healthier than delicious milk, and [[Your Mom|MADD]] wasn't too happy that they were promoting the idea of becoming borderline alcoholics/binge drinking to students, so PETA scrapped the campaign.

When this backfired, they replaced the idea of drinking cow's milk with drinking [[boob nazis|human milk]]. [[Do not want|Many declined]].

BTW PETA, [[fact|cowpox makes you invincible to a much more awesome disease called smallpox.]]

Also, [[Fact|cows '''''enjoy''''' being milked]].

[[Image:ColbertTrollsPeta.png|thumb|right|Thanks to [[Colbert]], we now know the gentle nature of PETA supporters.]]

===Timothy McVeigh===

Timothy McVeigh, the guy who was blowing up buildings full of innocent people ([[9/11|before it became cool]]) was on death row in 2001. PETA was retarded enough to send a letter to the jail's warden requesting the remainder of McVeigh's meals be vegetarian.

{{quote|"Please don't let Timothy McVeigh be responsible for the death of even one more living being."|[[Butthurt]] letter from PETA.}}

'''McVeigh responds!'''

Look, the guy was a deranged lunatic who killed [[Over 9000|over a hundred]] people, but he's not fucking [[retarded]] enough to agree with PETA. McVeigh replied with a letter pretty much [[Pwn|pwning]] PETA, proving that even people who are literally insane aren't insane enough for PETA's bullshit.

{{quote|"Truth is, I understand your cause - I've seen slaughter houses myself - but I still believe in reasonable taking and eating of game (as an outdoorsman and hunter)... I cannot sustain a prolonged intellectual debate on the subject as my time is short, but I'd suggest hitting Ted Kaczynski up for his opinions on the subject. [...] Where do you draw the line and what standard is used to define that line? Those that are in it for the health benefits accept poultry and fish as edible. Where do those opposed to suffering stand? (Ever see a fish struggling out of water?) What about grubs/worms/etc.? And finally, plants are alive too, they react to stimuli (including pain); have circulation systems, etc. So how about them?"|Tim McVeigh, killer of 168 people: too sane for PETA}}

===Web Games===
[[Image:Trollsens.jpg|thumb|right|Fucking lol]]
PETA has also developed and released several completely [[fucktard|fucktarded]], protest-oriented games on their [http://www.peta2.com/OUTTHERE/o_p2_games.asp peta2] website.  Among these include a [[Mario]] Bros. knockoff that villainizes [[delicious|Kentucky Fried Chicken]] and turns the Colonel into some kind of [[satan]]ic demon wielding a bloody butcher knife, a [http://www.peta2.com/cooking-mama/index.asp Cooking Mama game] where you graphically [[Gore|decapitate]], [[fisting|stuff]], and [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|roast]] a delicious [[Thanksgiving]] turkey, and a game where you go on a [[vandalism]] spree as a [[furry|little woodland creature]] with a can of spray paint.  It's really amazing that [[troll]]s this great are such complete faggots.

===Your Daddy Kills Animals===

Sadly lacking in any form of logic or reason, a common tactic for PETA is to scare children into becoming [[vegetarians]].

The heart-warming lesson of this pamphlet is that if your father has ever gutted a fish, [[Mr Hands|taken a ride on a horse]], or stroked the cat, then he is sadistic killer in the making - meaning [[you]] are next on his list.  If you do take a look at the pamphlet, notice that the "daddy" is wearing a suit and tie while gutting fish, not exactly the proper attire.  That and the crazy hat and manic face make him look like a bloodthirsty Inspector Gadget.  (Go, go Gadget Big Fucking Knife!)  Also, he's using a hook big enough to catch swordfish.  His gutting technique is completely fucked up as well.  You're supposed to lay the fish down on a flat surface and humanely cut the head off, spinal cord first if you can't put it in a creel and wait for it to die.  Asians, however, love fish heads, so they would simply rip the fish's guts out.

*[http://www.fishinghurts.com/pdfs/DaddyKillsAnimals.pdf See the entire pamphlet HERE]

{{tinyquote|[[LOLWUT|Since your daddy is teaching you the wrong lessons about right and wrong, you should teach him fishing is killing. Until your daddy learns it's not fun to kill, keep your doggies and kitties away from him. He's so hooked on killing defenseless animals, they could be next]].|PETA ([http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,176739,00.html sauce])}}

===[[Sea Kittens]]===
[[Image:Shark lady.jpg|thumb|right|Looks like she's enjoying it.]]

PETA's latest mind-numbing campaign already has its very own article.
The word "fish" should be replaced with the words "sea kittens."

In the spirit of things, [[Last Thursday|in September 2008]] [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2675452/Artist-hangs-herself-from-hooks-in-protest-at-shark-treatment.html a woman painted herself silver and suspended herself in the air with hooks through her back to protest shark fishing]. Although not directly connected to PETA, we will blame them anyway.  Cause we're [[cool]] like that.

===We Love You so Much We'll have to Kill You . . .===
*<b>Fact:</b> Out of the 1,997 animals that PETA "rescued" in 2007, [http://www.petakillsanimals.com/ 1,815 were killed] [[Over 9000|(>90%)]]. Doesn't sound very ethical, does it?
*<b>Fact:</b>. PETA has killed at least [[Over 9000|21,339]] animals as of the end of 2008. Very nice!
PETA's against animal shelters because they keep the animals in cages.  I guess euthanizing the animals is "ethical treatment", but caging them isn't.

===Save the Hambeasts===
[[Image:Petabillboard.jpg|thumb|right|When lolcows collide.]]

For the summer of 2009, PETA took aim at a particularly vulnerable trolling target, putting up billboards of a bikini-clad fatass and the slogan "SAVE THE WHALES. LOSE THE BLUBBER. GO VEGETARIAN." Predictably, feminist porkers all over the internets flew into a massive, quaking Jell-O mold rage, infuriated by the implication that their six-KFC-buckets-a-day diet might not be entirely healthy and morally defensible.

This represents a potentially wise change of direction for PETA, as they have finally found an opponent even more hypersensitive, irrational, and generally lulzy than they are. Just as long as nobody notices that the fattest animals are typically mostly vegetarian, and those species that eat primarily other animals are the leanest. It's [[science|true]], vegetation is a food source with wildly varying nutrient content. Relying on only vegetation for food means needing to store enough nutrients to outlast the seasons.••• And enough fat to store it all away in. Animals that eat other animals just don't need all that extra storage space. Herbivore meat is made primarily of the same [[shit noone cares about|molecular parts]] as a meat eater. Burn the extra fat for energy to catch more.

•••Unless you live [[California|somewhere]] where [[Email Feedback. Subject: No Bananas In California|everything]] grows throughout most of the year. (Or at least [[Arizona|within driving distance]] for an [[methamphetamine|interstate trucker]].) Of course, with so many yummy choices around, a vegetarian in California is likely to get fat anyways. [[Srsly]] - in most of [[No Cussing Club|coastal Southern California]], kids grow up having to clear the damned avocados out of the yard before trying to make buck mowing lawns. No shit, true story. Why do you think almost every vegan homeless religious nut flocked there in the 1970s? Hey all you bums, California's full of free food. Hurry! Go eat it up before they mix it with sand and make clean coal in the microwave. Because'' '''the last thing the world needs is carbon-neutral clean coal from California!!!''' ''There are much more important things to worry about in politics, like... 

Hambeasts doing things like getting rich while convincing people they don't deserve to eat meat, or saving a bunch of animals on camera, then having them [[holocaust|disposed of]] by [[capitalism|professionals]]!

It is worth noting that Danny DeVito is a very strict vegetarian, and has been for several years. And just look how fucking fat he is!

===Seal Hunt===

Not that anybody [[Shit_no_one_cares_about|gives a shit]] about [[Canada]]. Nobody, that is, but PETA, who have tried their hardest to ban seal hunting in Canada, which is the only way Canadians can survive in the cold hard winter, eh? Anyway, in a desperate attempt to increase ratings, some faggot radio station decided to shove a pie in one of the PETA member's face.

<youtube>p0XIN4P-7jE</youtube>

Looks like that fat bitch have already eaten one too many pies.

==Parodies==

<big><b>PETA</b></big>
<br />
In [[Old|1995]], Mike Doughney, an early Web 1.0 [[troll]], registered the peta.org domain name. He then put up a site with cooking recipes called "People Eating Tasty Animals", filled with parodies of PETA and veiled references to their politics.

[[BAWWW|PETA flipped their shit]]. They contacted the InterNIC in 1996 and demanded that the peta.org domain name be transferred to them. The InterNIC placed the peta.org domain on hold pending an investigation, before finally granting PETA the domain name in 2001 after deciding Mike was squatting and diluting their trademark.


<big><b>PWEETA</b></big>
<br />
PWEETA (People Who Enjoy Eating Tasty Animals) simultaneously mocks both PETA and meat-eaters by promoting both the consumption of animal flesh and [[cannibalism]].

<center>{{morphquote|parody1|background-color: white;|font-weight: normal;
|<b>Are you aware of the conditions on factory farms?</b>
<br>
PWEETA feels factory work is better left to qualified humans rather than to animals whose time is better spent fattening up than operating complicated machinery.|Particularly since they have no thumbs.

|<b>Have you ever personally experienced an alternative diet (vegetarian, fruitarian, etc.)?</b>
<br>
I have dabbled in what people call "cannibalism" as it is practiced on the island of Borneo. Islanders eat their dead in a literal communion with their spirits. Bt eating the deceased's essence, we gain their strength. And wisdom. The cannibalism of the islands is NOT murder, and neither is consumption of an animal raised for food.|And it's not rape if they're dead.

|<b>Q. Do you know any reasons to NOT eat meat?</b>
<br>
No. Meat is for everyone: young, old, rich or poor. Even if you're wretched, there's always some sort of edible flesh around - a rat, cats, roaches, your own foot...|Feet taste terrible.

===Hilarious Hypocrisy===

In a move that shouldn't surprise anyone who knows about PETA, in 1998, two years after filing suit against a man squatting on their domain name, [[Fail|PETA themselves registered the domains RINGLINGBROTHERS.COM and VOGUEMAGAZINE.COM]] and put up sites criticizing the circus' [[bestiality|treatment of animals]] and the magazine's printing of fur ads. Eventually, both Ringling Brothers and Vogue contacted PETA, and PETA caved, handing over both URL's. Fucking [[pussies]]

*PETA has been protesting [[Bonsai Kitten]]s, a well known trolling hoax, for over 8 years.
*PETA [http://www.peta.org/factsheet/files/FactsheetDisplay.asp?ID=34 advocates] feeding cats and dogs [[vegan]] diets. (even though cats are compulsory carnivores and they can't digest carbohydrates. Therefore cats will store the sugar in their liver and will eventually get diabetes and die).
*PETA [http://www.iamscruelty.com/ tells their followers to boycott Iams because it tests on animals]. Iams is a pet food company.
*PETA claims that animal killing is wrong, but every year they "put to rest" [[over 9,000]] animals using that lovely euthanization technique.
*PETA claims [[Lies|that owning any sort of animal (dog, cat, horse, etc.) to be used as a pet/companion is morally wrong, and the poor animal would have a greater chance of survival on the streets instead of at home with people]], which explains why if you feed a stray cat, he'll keep coming back to your house for more food. Of course.
*PETA, not unlike [[Scientology]], strives to recruit high profile, big name stars to spread their propaganda. One such star is Kimora Lee, despite the fact that her "Baby Phat" clothing line conspicuously features leather and fur trim. However, she donated $20,000US to the PETA War Chest, so PETA thinks that she's aawwwwwriiiight!

==Fur==
[[File:Bushy pubic.jpg|thumb|Fur is now banned everywhere except [[Spain]].]]
Fur is the old name given by pron directors to pubic hair. Even in [[fox|Hollywood]] for years a "glimpse of fur" was what every aspiring film maker hoped to capture from nubile young starlets. Wikipedia lists the type of fur as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair#Style];

*Trimmed
*Triangle
*Landing strip
*Toothbrush mustache
*Brazilian waxing/G-wax
*Full-Brazilian/Hollywood/Bare/Bald Beaver/Bald eagle

*Mohawk
*Dyed hair

*Others

However now that fur is banned, everybody gets totally depilated to look more like underage [[loli]].
