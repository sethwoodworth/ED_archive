Elgorgo
[[Image:S320x320.jpg|thumb|Elgorgo is a fucking fat fuck and an asshole.]]

{{lj|elgorgo}} is a [[friendless]] [[basement-dweller|basement-dwelling]] [[fat|fattie]] who is [[obsession|obsessed]] with the [[internet]]. He spends 20 hours a day online and even has a laptop next to the toilet. He is incapable of maintaining friendships or having any sort of normal human emotion. He is overrated, dangerous and untalented.

In the early years of the [[LiveJournal]], Elgorgo enjoyed moderate internet popularity. However, as the site grew, Elgorgo's journal became less entertaining and more frightening, culminating in a series of psychotic Andy Kaufman-like pranks.

Elgorgo is not a nice guy. If he is nice to you it is because he is secretly plotting against you.

== "Everyone in this community is a fucker and I hate them" ==

[[Image:Elgorgoandcat.jpg|thumb|Photo of Elgorgo often sent to camwhores as a means to woo them. He actually looks more like the photo above.]]

In 2001 Elgorgo turned a popular meme into a popular community, [http://www.livejournal.com/community/fucklist fucklist]. In the primordial ooze of early LiveJournal, users were desperate for any kind of [[lemming]]-like activity to fall in line with. The official point of the community was for users to make a list of other LiveJournal users they wanted to fuck. The actual point of the community was to annoy and frustrate community members with a shifting set of illogical rules, long-rambling paranoid accusations and random [[ban set|banhammers]]. 

To say that Elgorgo was malsuited for any kind of management or community involvement would be an understatement.

After relentlessly harassing a [[camwhore]] for spamming the community, [[LJ Abuse]] took the community from Elgorgo and put it under the management of the abuse team leader at the time, [[tommyx]]. An oversight or a glitch in the system allowed Elgorgo maintainer access to the community months later. Unaware that tommyx was the head of abuse, Elgorgo removed his maintainer status and banned him from the community.

The next day, Elgorgo found himself suspended from LiveJournal.

A long, arduous [[Victim|e-mail campaign]] was launched and eventually the suspension was overturned by [[Brad|God]] himself.

== A Pathetic Life ==

[[Image:Egbingo.jpg|thumb|Based on a short-lived meme created by an [[Saljer]], this "Internet Loser Bingo" board features Elgorgo's LiveJournal icon in the center.]]

For all intents and purposes, Elgorgo's journal actually died near the end of 2002. With the advent of assembly line trolling, sex-work writers and weird news aggregators, Elgorgo's stale act was stinking up the place. Any residual [[e-fame]] from the [[lj abuse]] debacle faded quickly in the minds of fickle readers.

To make matters more hilarious, Elgorgo's longtime girlfriend (also a LiveJournal user) left him for a lesbian she met on - you guessed it - LiveJournal. She left with the cats and told him to never contact her again, which of course he did anyway because he is a pathetic [[stalker|internet stalker]].

Shortly after being dumped, Elgorgo lost his mid-salary Research & Development cubicle job and his mind. Elgorgo was not only a loser on the internet, but in the real world as well! Living on the dole for 6 months, he wrote about nothing outside of his [[lesbian]] ex-girlfriend, ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and the pornography he rented from the 24-hour store around the corner.

== Didn't You Die? ==
In August 2004, Elgorgo changed his journal into a character journal (see [[Billiam]], [[Flashman]], [[Ghostlight]]), featuring incredibly believable stories about getting in fist-fights at the gas station and being asked to participate in [[homosexual]] [[chubby]] chaser porn.

The month-long series ended with his [[fake death]]. Nothing was posted regarding the death in his journal, but Elgorgo's friends-list mobilized to spread the rumor all over LiveJournal. This caused [[unfunny]] users unfamiliar with Elgorgo much confusion, even going so far as attempting to sleuth out his [[IRL]] hometown, father's obituary and call the local funeral homes.

Sadly, the internet [[detective|detectives]] got the name of the town wrong. Even worse, Elgorgo was not actually dead. Worst of all, he had more readers than ever. The [[jumped the shark|shark had been jumped]], but the journal kept trundling on, it's best days far behind.

== Fake LJer ==
Elgorgo is <strike>not</strike> a real person. Here is the proof:

* No one knows his real name.
* No one knows where he lives
* No one has ever met him IRL
* Claims to have a son named "Aiden"
* No real photos of him have ever been seen
* He has never been a member of MENSA or the RPGA.
* Whenever he says something to me that I don't agree with, he is trolling me.
* His MySpace account is located here: [http://www.myspace.com/earlegorgo Elgorgo's MySpace account]

This proves that Elgorgo does <strike>not</strike> exist.

== He will ruin everything ==

[[Image:Elgorgo_the_internet_penguin.jpg|thumb|Elgorgo ruined Pokey the Penguin.]]

Whenever it appears that Elgorgo is schmoozing with internet superstars, [[detective|watchdogs]] will immediately launch a preemptive campaign (including both signed and [[Anonymous pussies|anonymous]] e-mails) to keep Elgorgo out of any position of power, including: [[moderator]], administrator, [[cocksucker]], or bureaucrat.

This is because Elgorgo will ruin everything. [[At least 100 years ago|Everyone on the internet]] knows this.

An example:
 <b>Elgorgo:</b> I like that [[Ljdrama]] site can I write for it?
 <b>[[Hepkitten]]:</b> Suck a million cocks you boring choad!
 <b>Elgorgo:</b> YEAH WELL I'M TOO GOOD FOR IT ANYWAY.
 <b>[[Hepkitten]]:</b> By the hoary anarchist gods, you totally suck.

 <b>Elgorgo:</b> Oh [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is so awesome. Can I become a moderator?
 <b>[[Anonymous pussies|Anonymous Pussy]]:</b> [[OMG]] [[Girlvinyl|GV]] Don't let him have anything to do with it 
                  he will ruin everything!

Despite a penchant to ruin everything, Elgorgo briefly wrote articles for [[Ljdrama]] until the group broke up. He has been banned from [[Rant about cons]], LJers for president, [[Salj]], Idis, [[Nonuglygeeks]] and is mostly ignored in any other community he posts to.

In addition to most of the internet, [[feminists]], [[lesbians]], and the former members of [[Salj]] (known as [[Saljers]]) do not find Elgorgo funny.

Contrary to popular belief, Elgorgo is not a [[troll]]. [[Troll]]s are much smarter.

== Illiterate ==
A hilarious thing happens whenever Elgorgo tries to [[pwn]] someone on the internet: in his [[fat]] angry rage, he will omit important words reveal himself [[fucktarded|idiot]] is. This is possibly caused by his delicate fat-fingered condition which keeps him from hitting all the necessary keys.
