A '''Faghag''' is a female who has a deep and [[retard]]ed desire to fuck [[fags]]. Synonymous with "fruit fly" and "mental lethargy". There is a no difference between a [[faghag]] and girl with a lot of [[gay]] friends. Faghags are delusional [[heterosexual]] females who think even though they have a [[Penis|vagina]], they will still be able to convince one of their faggot friends to date them.

The more traditional definition is that faghags are women who like the company of men but for one reason or another are so repulsive they can't get one of their own so they company around with queer guys.

A great, yet very [[gay]], example of a faghag is the "Will & Grace & Vince & Nadine" episode of ''[[Will & Grace]]'' (view the transcript [http://www.durfee.net/will/scripts/s0707.htm here]). In the episode, Will's current squeeze, Vince, has his [[faghag]] come over to meet Will and Grace. Retardation ensues, and Nadine tries to break up the relationship between Will and Vince. In the end, Grace sits Nadine down and explains she will never ever have Vince. That night, Nadine blows off Vince for dinner and has sex with a random man from the subway. The moral of the story is that because Grace realizes she will never have Will, she is not a [[faghag]], and because Nadine is a stupid [[douche]], she is a [[faghag]]. This in no way changes the fact that ''Will & Grace'' is a shit TV show.
