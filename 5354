'''[[Pedobear|Wacko Jacko]]''' was a 50-year-old white [[13-year-old|manchild]] who found fame and fortune as a homosexual pederast and so became a poster boy for [[NAMBLA]]. He could also sing and dance like an organ grinder's monkey. Born as a small black boy into a large family of singing and dancing chimps, he eventually struck out on his own to [[Carlton|turn into a white]] [[tranny]] version of Diana Ross, travel around the world [[shotacon|luring young boys]], monkeys and [[Birdman|Elephant Men]] to slumber parties at his very own castle, Neverland, and to prove once and for all that when [[buttsecks|the big hand touches the little hand]], it's time to get the fuck right outta there! 

On June 25th, 2009 Wacko Jacko was [[buttsecks|playing doctor]] with his personal aesthetician after a hard day rehearsing for an upcoming tour and after nagging the shit out of the poor IRL doctor about not being able to sleep, keeled over from an overdose of the hospital-grade elephant tranquilliser Diprivan (or "[[drugs|milk]]" to Jacko). Yes, that's right, [[great justice]] finally had its day as Jackson was put down by the [[death|Grim RÃ¦per]] for being the [[pedobear|damn dirty ape]] he is via lethal injection. Jackson's highly polished exo-skeleton will be stuffed with robotics and placed on display at Disney's Hall of Presidents.

Long rumoured to be the leading cause of ejaculations in [[underage ban]]s, it wasn't until 2003 that the long arm of the law touched Jacko inappropriately when one of his many victims' mothers revealed lurid description of Jacko's [[cock|wedding tackle]] after he ran out of [[bribery|hush money]]. Despite being legally a [[white]] woman, '''Captain EO''' played [[The Race Card|the race card]] like [[OJ]] in his/her 2003 pedophilia trial.

Amongst the train wreckage of a life full of batshit crazy behaviour, he leaves a legacy that includes being the author of [[W]]'s controversial '''No Child's Behind Left''' plan and saving humanity from the [[Beatles]] voluminous catalogue of songs (after outbidding [[Paul McCartney]] for the [[Jew gold|publishing rights]]) by preventing iTunes from offering said drek to the public.

Always a controversial figure, he will nonetheless be fondly remembered for the infamous "wardrobe malfunction" on live TV at [[Football|Super Bowl XXXVIII]] on February 1, 2004 in which he exposed his penis to [[Justin Timberlake]] during the half-time show

He is survived by [[wikipedia:Bubbles_(chimpanzee)|Bubbles the chimp]], the Elephant Man's remains, several children called [[true|Blanket]], a [[cumdumpster|surrogate babymamma]], Macauley Culkin, Stephen Spielberg, [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-michael-jackson31-2009may31,0,1441957.story a mountain of debt], and the joke:

 '''Q:''' What do Michael Jackson and KMart have in common?
 '''A.''' Little boys' pants half off!

He will be missed by children everywhere for so many will never know the sweet caress of Michael Jackson's gloved hand.
