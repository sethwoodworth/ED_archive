Angelique DeSatanos
[[Image:Dyer2.jpg|thumb|She's got that staaaaare, man]]
Angelique DeSatanos is an [[old]] [[cunt|lady]] who pretends to be young by playing on the [[internets]] all fucking day and being a total [[whore]] in her sad attempt to [[fuck you I'm a dragon|RP]]. She is also the mother of two [[children]], and treats them like stuffed animals. She was sent to jail in December for failing to notice that her children had decided to play in traffic, after they escaped from her filth covered apartment and toddled out over a six foot fence to the freeway.

==Elitist [[Bitch|writing abilities]]==

Taken from user's [[role-play]] profile: 
{{quote|'''Disclaimer: Typist does not validate slave characters, (Gorean or otherwise) and all rp from such characters will be ignored.
Typist note: Typist does not care for the bs that people do. Typist will randomly ignore those that have caused such before. Whispers are not on, typist does not /do/ ooc. Typist exercises the right not to speak or deal or rp with those that survive by these tactics of rp. Should find typist or character not responding, then you are on that list.'''|The bitch}}

This character is so 733t that she won't play with [[you]]!

==Kids?  What kids?==

[[Bitch]] can't even keep track of her kids.  [[Last Thursday]] she passed out from a vigorous round of cybersex with her imaginary boyfriend (who is not her IRL husband, btw) and left the sprogs to their own devices.  The three year old boy got the fuck out of there and climbed over the retaining fence.  Like all [[children]] born to [[fucktarded]] parents, he was already displaying signs of being [[an hero]], and headed straight for the interstate to play in traffic.  Evidently this was not the first time this had happened, according to the neighbors who pulled him off the road.  Police then went to the house to ask his mother why her son was playing semi tag and found the two year old wandering around the trash strewn apartment in a shit stained diaper, eating spaghetti-o's right off the floor.  Numnums.  Mommy dearest didn't seem to notice or care that her kid had been gone for over two hours.  The [[police]] were not amused.

==[[PWNED]]!!==
[[Image:Dyerjail.jpg|thumb|200px|Here she is, in jail. Go flame her profile laughing at her jailed ass]]Boy, that [[internet]] [[drugs|addiction]] can be a bitch, can't it?  Today, the judge laughed in her face, sentencing her to 1 year in prison, followed by 1 year house arrest, and yet ANOTHER year of probation. The judge told her that she was [[retarded]] and that she should have learned from the other [[at least 100|100]] times she's let her kids play in the street. Do you think she'll be able to use the internet in prison? 

==ZOMG PREGNANT?!==
[[Gossip|Rumor]] states that Nancy/Angelique is pregnant with yet ANOTHER kid, therefore proving that falling asleep post cyber sex CAN get you [[pregnant]]. Further speculation as to whether she will give up parental rights to ''this'' little crotch dropping or whether it will be snatched away remains to be seen.
