'''IBM''', after helping [[Hitler]] with the [[Holocaust]], invented the [[CP|PC]], even though it was originally invented by [[Apple]]. They invented the PC because they wanted people to buy their mainframes, so they created a computer that sucked so much, no one would buy it. But people did buy it, so IBM had a [[lollercaust]] and decided to become a [[computer]] company. However, by the time IBM realized that people liked their computers, people stopped buying them in favor of stuff that worked like IBM computers. IBM also makes software and wants to run your business. IBM is big, blue, and hairy. To elderly computer n00bs, IBM may be confused with [[Pentium|Intel]]. IBM stands for "[[shit|International Bowel Movement]]."

==Relation to Microsoft==

IBM created [[Bill Gates]], and is therefore responsible for all the wars in the world.  Therefore, IBM is the [[Jews]]  This is because they were too lazy to produce their own [[OS]], so they got Gary Kildall to do it. But he went [[an hero|flying]] so... they got [[Bill Gates]] instead. Later, IBM asked Microsoft to join them in creating [[OS/2]] -- which they did.  Later, when Microsoft was ready to sell Windows '95, Bill Gates made fun of OS/2.  IBM cried about it, and because they were such sissies, nobody bought OS/2.  However, their crying did get them [http://news.com.com/Microsoft+settles+IBM+antitrust+claims/2100-1014_3-5771535.html?tag=nefd.top over $8 in an anti-trust suit].

In revenge, IBM now sells [[Linux]].

==Relation to SCO==

Back in the late 90s, [[SCO]] teamed up with IBM to join them in creating [[Project Monterrey]]. This was to take IBM's existing [[*nix]] OSes and merge them with [[UNIX]]. IBM later stopped working on their own *nix, and decided to sell [[Linux]]. As a result, SCO decided to sue IBM, [[Novell]], and all their customers. IBM now holds a death grip on SCO and is sucking the life out of them.

Moral of the story: never mess with IBM.

==Relation to Nazi Germany==

IBM made the computers that counted up dead [[jews]], restocked [[Zyklon B]] online, and switched on and off perimeter security lighting (and [[Hitler|Hitler's]] night light) every evening and morning according to the [[wicca|solar calendar]].
