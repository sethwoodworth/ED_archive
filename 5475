[[Image:Moonbeam poll.jpg|center]]

[http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com ED Forums] had its [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/showthread.php?t=587 drama cherry popped] by an [[fucktard|intelligent]] [[faggot|gentleman]] with [[dying alone|strong future prospects]], '''moon_beam_750'''. You would assume the last place one would want to make a dick of themself is ED. However monsieur Moonbeam, butthurt over having his [[shit|excellent]] threads being constantly [[raped|altered]] by mods, decided to tell the ED Forums admin and [[ED:IRC|IRC]] op, [[User:Kazantzakis|dan]], just how the mods should be [[fapping|doing their job]]. The forums' members had other ideas for how to [[anal sex|deal with]] malcontents such as this...

==About Moonbeam==
<!-- This section is too short, needs to be fleshed out. Dox plox?-->
* Is a [[faggot]] with a [[Ladyboy|boyfriend]] named Patrick. The [[sodomy|relationship]] will [[lies|last for decades]] he says.
* Is a [[13 year old girl|self-diagnosed]] "bipolar" who cried when he [[fatty|couldn't fit into his jeans]].
* Has a job [[blowjob|serving]] "[[Gay_Niggers_from_Outer_Space|crazy ass people]]" at McDonald's.
* Likes donkey dick
* Has the intellect of a downs syndrome kid
* Said he was [[Done with ED|done with ED Forums]]. [[User:RLJ|Sound familiar?]]
* Initially typed everything in size 20 font, in an attempt to conceal his small penis.
* Complained like a bitch that everyone on EDF [[BAW|"Does not take things seriously"]]. The faggot failed to realize not everybody was interested in his [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|one man hate campaign against rap]] and his thing for "[[Sick Fuck|hot 40 year old men good at dominance]]".

==ED Forums==
Moon_beam_750's [[butthurt]] came to a head when ol' Mooney didn't get [[GTFO|the message]] after being [[banhammer|banned]] for his faggotry once. So when Moonbeam fucked up once again by posting a poll reminiscent of [[Kimmo Alm|Kimmo's]] "grinds my gears", the mod added a third option to the poll, calling Moonbeam a fucko and causing [[massive damage|massive butthurt]].

Naturally, one would assume, that you should put the issue to rest, since [[User:Zaiger|Zaiger]] started tagging people with the word [[Faggot]] when they whined. "But I'm all for equality" said Moonbeam, so he took it to the [[IRC|higher ups]].

Moonbeam, ever the fan of [[socialism|equality]] and [[buttsex|democracy]] decided to have a [[Rage|calm and reasoned]] chat with the mods on IRC. So after [[Media:Rsz_moonbeambuyirc.jpg|buying a copy of IRC]], Moonbeam proceeded straight to #forum to voice his concerns by [[asking for it|calling two of the mods assholes]] and then asking to have one of the mods [[banned|de-oped]].

The [[sick fucks|gentlemen]] casually chatting in the channel decided they were thirsty for some [[lolcow|milk]]. So started the trolling of Moonbeam. Moonbeam, ever the [[Assburgers|intelligent]] man, decided that his position needed defending, and he dutifully went about doing so with the use of [[dubious disclaimer|dubious disclaimers]]. For at least fifteen minutes Moonbeam sat in IRC, giving [[ebonics|insightful replies]] to those who dared question his [[fail|mighty logic]]. After watching Moonbeam get raped in every orifice, the mod [[User:Kazantzakis|dan]] finally banned him. But the [[lulz|goodtimes]] were not through yet.

{{quote|Just the other night I cried because my jeans can barely fit me anymore. I always say that I don't care about my weight, but here lately, I keep getting more conscious about it.|[[BAWWWW]]}}

The [[stalker|internet detectives]] on #forum found his [[MySpace]] and [[raped|pillaged]] it's content for precious [[lulz]]. The lulz were found in the form of [[tl;dr]] bawwwwfests talking about how shit it is to [[retard|work at McDonald's]] and be a fat faggot at the same time. Like every other myspace kiddie, Moonbeam feels he has [[unwarranted self importance|important things to say about the world]], has a [[GRIDS|mental illness]] which he doesn't take [[meth|medication]] or see a [[pimp|doctor]] for, is a [[faggot|latent homosexual]] and [[fat girl angle shot|has the same expression for every single photo]].

After realising the [[trolls|meanies]] from ED were posting his super secret journals on the forums, Moonbeam engaged in the classic internet pastime of [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]]. His MySpace pics and blog have been [[fukken saved|saved]] for your [[fap|viewing pleasure]] [http://el.iti.st/files/mb750.7z here].

lulzkiller: yeah hes prob the best mod
moon_beam_750: but yeah like I was saying that is like on the pro life thread
moon_beam_750: that is like me being a mod and saying well I don't agree with what you have to say so I am going to alter your thread/delete it because I don't have to reason with you
moon_beam_750: that's basically what wit did and I don't know if wit did it for a joke but I don't find it very funny

moon_beam_750: lol
lulzkiller: he has a big no
&dan: (no)
moon_beam_750: lol fair enough
&dan: and here's why
&dan: ed sysops and edf moderators are assholes
&dan: also, they chat hard
moon_beam_750: Still why should it have to be that way
moon_beam_750: altering posts because you feel differently
+vonLipwig: the solution is to start sucking mod dick
moon_beam_750: I am the last person to suck mod dick
&dan: show me the thread where the original post was altered
moon_beam_750: They were given capabilities therefore they should know acting like assholes will not encourage other uses to join or post
moon_beam_750: http://forums.encyclopediadramatica....read.php?t=549
moon_beam_750: wit mess with the poll I made
+vonLipwig: it's not so much they were given them but they were entitled to them
+vonLipwig: afaik all the mods are ed sysops
moon_beam_750: and then put that a white boy hating on rap as part of the thread topic
lulzkiller: trufax
&dan: lol
&dan: i like how wit helped you
moon_beam_750: how so
moon_beam_750: in the thread she was saying daft punk said the same thing
&dan: by making your poll results more clear for me to read
moon_beam_750: ? I am lost
&dan: <---being an asshole
moon_beam_750: lol
+vonLipwig: oh kazaanana
+vonLipwig: the forums looked the same in firefox btw
lulzkiller: hey dan i know this is prob highly confidential information but when you register one of the new forum group things is it like dibating
moon_beam_750: either way she saying other people do this but my point is that rappers make it horrible
lulzkiller: <------ this person failed englis btw
lulzkiller: english
&dan: restate teh question
+vonLipwig: looks like you failled intelligence as well
moon_beam_750: how I have no control over that and I think I made it pretty clear
+vonLipwig: chill out you're taking it way too seriously
&dan: moonbeam, there is a music forum, so i think most of the music stuff in general is open season...you just have to pay ten bucks to be left alone
lulzkiller: von some people become rocket sientests some become plumbers
&dan: plumbers make more money
lulzkiller: prob
moon_beam_750: ok but it is still retarded why should I post in a thread that isn't a topic
&dan: but anyways, please restate your question lulzkiller
lulzkiller: when you pay your ten bucks
&dan: also, vonlip, that is really unfortunate that it looks that way
&dan: it doesnt here, but i am starting to hate that skin
moon_beam_750: well I won't pay ten dollars until people stop acting like dicks to me until then just no
lulzkiller: is there a debating forum whern you pay your money
moon_beam_750: my question was
vonranke: evening all
+vonLipwig: no but there's a questions and answer forum for asking the mods questions like that.
+vonLipwig: so it's worth it for you i think
&dan: there is a donating button where it links you to a third party online company
moon_beam_750: basically that rappers should no sample music if they are going to try to cash in on sampling music
+vonLipwig: well that's pretty stupid.
moon_beam_750: well I am tired of this, the one time I got banned for making a thread, no warning I just got banned and that isn't fair
+vonLipwig: why should rappers be any exception?
moon_beam_750: because they make it horrible
moon_beam_750: how many people complain about other people sampling
+vonLipwig: yeah it's true that commercial rnb/rap is bullshit but you're being really general and illogical
&dan: i will ask wit what happened and get back to you
moon_beam_750: I guess but it is still shitty regardless I am not going to pony up and pay ten dollars to a service I am not going to get my fair share of
Poly_: err, what's the drama here?
&dan: vonlip, now i cannot find the donations link, isnt it on the front page?
Poly_: your thread got changed?
+vonLipwig: pretty much every genre has sampling in it, if you're against sampling argue against sampling, it doesn't matter if it's a rapper sampling or pink floyd
moon_beam_750: yes and it has been the second time someone altered my thread or deleted it
+vonLipwig: user CP paid subscriptions dan
moon_beam_750: BUT MY POINT WAS...
Poly_: what exactly got changed? :S
moon_beam_750: rappers make it horrible
&dan: thats not showing up for me, but thanks
moon_beam_750: my poll and wit made a sarcastic poll response
+vonLipwig: well you don't like rap and wit does
lulzkiller: damn my lack of credit card
moon_beam_750: my point is
Poly_: so what was the poll before? just "yes" or "no"?
vonranke: i think the results of the poll are fairly convincing
moon_beam_750: yes
moon_beam_750: ?
Poly_: .. that's really what you're complaining about?
moon_beam_750: no one understands
moon_beam_750: the options were
+vonLipwig: those fucking rappers
moon_beam_750: yes
+vonLipwig: fuck them
moon_beam_750: no
+vonLipwig: fuck rappers
+vonLipwig: fuck
moon_beam_750: Not just rappers do this, fucko
moon_beam_750: that is a poll choice
vonranke: and it has a resounding majority
Poly_: well it was kind of a stupid question to begin with and since most of the thread responses point out that sampling is in every genre of music I think it's valid
+vonLipwig: it's true when rappers sample music they create the square root of shit
+vonLipwig: which is arse
Poly_: <moon_beam_750> I think I am going to start asking the Admin of the forum if I can replace on of the mods because this stuff is getting pretty fucking ridiculous
Poly_: lol
moon_beam_750: You know I wouldn't care but I am all for equality
moon_beam_750: I was banned once becauase of a mod
Poly_: besides the fact that the mods are all ED sysops, that is the fastest way to ensure you NEVER get considered for moderating anywhere
moon_beam_750: and my poll was changed because someone wanted to be a smart bitch about it
Poly_: and it was funny
moon_beam_750: well I hate it
moon_beam_750: like I said
lulzkiller: internet is seriouse buisness
moon_beam_750: why donate to ED if they are going to treat me poorly to begin with
vonranke: ah man, its just a bit of fun, they're just going to see how butthurt you are and laugh
+vonLipwig: you care about this way too much mano
Poly_: if you're "all for equality" then you are completely unsuited for anything ED-related
moon_beam_750: well whatever I am done with the forum
Poly_:
moon_beam_750: I am "butthurt" because they shouldn't change my stuff
+vonLipwig: every cloud has a silver lining
moon_beam_750: I posted 2 things all together
vonranke: BLUE SKIES ARE GONNA CLEAR UP
moon_beam_750: actually three
vonranke: PUT ON A HAPPY FACE
moon_beam_750: fuck ed
moon_beam_750: I am done
Poly_: I see that you posted 214 things
Poly_: in.. a week
+vonLipwig: i will post your goodbye thread
moon_beam_750: I mean threads
moon_beam_750: I posted 3 threads
moon_beam_750: 1 was altered
moon_beam_750: one was deleted
moon_beam_750: so why post at all if people are going to piss on my topic
vonranke: maybe your threads sucked
moon_beam_750: I try my best to be as fluid in my topic to make it so everyone can discuss it
Poly_: "Is raping the pro life women and getting them pregnant worth the lulz and being raped by big bubba? Hmmm...I wonder..."
moon_beam_750: whatever I don't need this, and ED does not need my money either
Poly_: THIS IS NOT EQUALITY
moon_beam_750: I hope ED burns to the fucking ground I am tired of this and I just say that it wasn't fair and everyone is like NO YOU ARE WRONG MOONBEAM
moon_beam_750: I try to be good
moon_beam_750: I try to do things and be logical
Poly_: you bitched about it for ages and ages and complained about it in here and in multiple threads
Poly_: you didn't just say "that's not fair"
moon_beam_750: well you know what
moon_beam_750: just to be spiteful
Poly_: you have learned nothing from ED if this is how you take an internet forum
moon_beam_750: I am just going to keep on bitching
moon_beam_750: how about that
moon_beam_750: well a forum should be fair
Poly_: go for it
moon_beam_750: I shouldn't be banned because people disagree with a post I make
vonranke: ahahaha i love this
moon_beam_750: well whatever ED has hard time getting money as it is
+vonLipwig: logs are up on the forum btw
Poly_: oh fuck
Poly_: you're a guy?
Poly_: seriously?
moon_beam_750: am I
moon_beam_750: or am I not?
moon_beam_750: --------------fuck anything said before-------------
moon_beam_750: but may I say this
moon_beam_750: I am only "mad"
Poly_: man, I thought it was only us girls who got pissy about mean people
moon_beam_750: because I write threads and when I try to get people to discuss things I try to make the topic so everyone can discuss it
+vonLipwig: you're a girl?
lulzkiller: are you a girl poly?
vonranke: how old are you moonbeam?
+vonLipwig: lets skip the talking and get to the rape
+vonLipwig: and by talking i meant stalking
lulzkiller: lipwig your my new idol haha
moon_beam_750: I made a total of 3 threads and mods have always been banning or altering my posts
Poly_: moon_beam_750: lurk moar
moon_beam_750: that isn't fair and I would find it humorous if wit wasn't being biased about it
moon_beam_750: because wit thought something completely different she decided to spam polls and tell me how it is no different
vonranke: well theres a pretty simple solution to this all
moon_beam_750: than other artists when my sole point was that rappers usually sample other songs that are nostalgic and completely ruined them whether the song was horrible or not to begin with
+vonLipwig: rappers aren't the only people that do this
moon_beam_750: but know wit changed my poll and made the thread a big joke by telling me NO other people do it to which completely misses the fucking point
moon_beam_750: that is all
moon_beam_750: but HERE RECENTLY
moon_beam_750: yes rappers have been the ones doing it RECENTLY
+vonLipwig: and besides it's not fucking rappers anyway
moon_beam_750: I even showed videos to prove my point
vonranke: i think it was in the delivery moonbeam. and that you came off sounding like a 15 year old
+vonLipwig: it's shitty commercial rnb rap bullshit that you're complaining about
+vonLipwig: real rap has so much more class
moon_beam_750: I was being general about it
moon_beam_750: do I seriously have to write 10 pages of shit to prove a point
moon_beam_750: oh wait it would be altered if no one agreed with it
+vonLipwig: if it takes that much for you to actually make a valid point sure
moon_beam_750: so thank god I didn't right ten pages
Poly_: people have posted plenty of controversial shit on the forums
moon_beam_750: everyone else seemed to get what I was saying
moon_beam_750: and tell me this if you aren't supposed to take anything on ED seriously then what is the point in posting topic discusses if it is all going to be a big joke anyway
moon_beam_750: the forum would just be better off if every other post was DESU
vonranke: OH DAMN YOU GOT US THERE
moon_beam_750: yeah basically
Poly_: so it's either "take everything seriously" or "spam stupid crap"?
moon_beam_750: any topic I have seen seems like everyone makes it into a big joke and then the thread is basically dead
lulzkiller: took the words right from my mouth
moon_beam_750: no but there should be a medium
Poly_: there is a medium
Poly_: you just don't recognise it, clearly
moon_beam_750: I obviously posting something for people to discuss
vonranke: oh shit all these years ive spent studying logic and writing thesis' and ive been completely steamrolled with two sentences
moon_beam_750: no for people to ridicule me by calling me a whiney 15 year old and saying I am a fucko white boy who hates rap
moon_beam_750: that is discriminating
+vonLipwig: you evidently are a white boy that hates rap
vonranke: this is too good
moon_beam_750: in no way I intended to sound whiney I was just saying
vonranke: you couldnt make this up
moon_beam_750: oh ok
+vonLipwig: calling out discrimination on the ed forums is also equally ironic
moon_beam_750: first of all I am not entirely white
moon_beam_750: I am mixed
moon_beam_750: I am not 15 years old
Poly_: you're whining right now
moon_beam_750: because people are acted like because I said something that I am now lower than them and that everyone opinion and logic is better than mine
moon_beam_750: you are sitting there right now still continuing to condescend on me
vonranke: yup
Poly_: oh yes
moon_beam_750: that makes you no better
Poly_: yes it does
moon_beam_750: see sarcasm right there
moon_beam_750: condescending
Poly_: what the fuck
vonranke: by definition of your argument, it does
Poly_: my phone has been ringing all day with an Eastern States number
Poly_: constantly
moon_beam_750: oh ok I forgot everyone is right but me
Poly_: and I pick up the phone, say "Hello?" and an Indian woman says "Hello?" then hangs up
moon_beam_750: you know everyone is right besides me
Poly_: then calls back
vonranke: except on opposite day
Poly_: and I hear a kid in the background
moon_beam_750: you know everyone is right besides me
Poly_: and I say "Hello?" and she hangs up again
moon_beam_750: you know everyone is right besides me
Poly_: stop repeating yourself, you twat
lulzkiller: trufax
moon_beam_750: your a twat
moon_beam_750: I am glad you can start name calling to you fat prick</pre>|0}}

==Moon Beam... the Aftermath==

After all was said and done, an apologetic Moon beam 750 slunk back into #forum and for some odd reason, felt the need to apologize for his actions.

'''splat:''' Hey are you there?<br/>
'''splat:''' Well I just wanted to say this bit before I go but I just needed some closure for myself. I wanted to apologize that I did act in such a way that wasn't very good and something as minor as a thread is nothing to be worked up over<br/>
'''splat:''' In my defense I did wake up upon going to the forum and I was upset because I trying to make a point and wit tried to make me feels stupid (or that's what it seemed like)<br/>
'''splat:''' If it would be possible I would like to set up a time so that everyone can come to the irc so I can apologize<br/>
'''splat:''' (again it really isn't in my interest to join the forum again but coming at this problem will make me feel better at the least)<br/>
'''splat:''' so can you at least grant me that request<br/>

==A RETURN?!?!==
After a record of two days of [[quitting IRC forever]], it appears that Moon beam 750 returned as <i>Moonsex</i>, giving us all a very [[bullshit|special message of his homecoming]] on our forums. 

{{quote|Hey I missed you guys.  I almost cried about the amount of hate, but I know there is unlimited forgiveness.|Moonbeam and his [[lie|fortunate]] return.}}

[[Some argue]] that this is not the second resurrection of Moon beam, but a [[troll]]. Others also argue that [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody gives a shit]], which is probably [[True|the closer bet]].
