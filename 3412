When a [[Wikipedophile]] decides to be an [[attention whore]] for their [[buttsecks|hard work]] they put in to make their [[article]] better (whilst also being too [[fucktard]]ed to write a featured article, [[amirite]]?)

Someone comes along and looks at it for 2 minutes, doesn't bother to check the references, and hey, you've got yourself an [[shit nobody cares about|accurate]] enyclopedia entry, [[lies|right]]?

The faggoty [[Internet Hate Machine|process]] means that on talk pages on [[TOW]] there's always this shit on them that says something like "[[Uncyclopedia|Article about unfunny non-internet relevant subject]] has been listed as a [[unfunny|good article]] under the [[shit nobody cares about|good-article criteria]], if you can [[fellatio|improve it further]], please do[[oneoneone|!!!!1111one]]".

Actually, it's unfunny as fuck, and I think [[NPOV]] is making me [[emo|cry]] with how uninteresting this crap is and [[Jimbo]] needs to become [[an hero]].

Similar shit beaurocratic processes include the [[featured article]] and the [[vital article]] which <s>will be</s> were written about on ED (after this article was written; this one came first), for the [[lulz]].

==[[Trolling]] good articles==
Go to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:GAN good article nominees page], and create an account, and pass the shit articles and list them as good, and fail the well referenced articles and do not list them as good articles. This will be a form of [[epic lulz]] which causes massive disruption and can even [[Urban Rose|turn away]] editors [[seeking]] recognition for their work.
