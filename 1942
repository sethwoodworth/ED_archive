{{quote|<%ShardDax> I was still gonna go deleting all I found 
<%ShardDax> Userpages, articles, etc.<br>
<Pory-tan> lol|Made his 3 day ban turned into a one week ban.}}
<br>
{{quote|<ShardDax> Meh alright then, have fun [[lolwut|supporting bad trolls]] and trying to get Lmte his job back.|ShardDax|Earned him a one month ban, and [[Facepalm|still clueless]] that '[[mod sass|talking shit = moar ban]]'}}

==Rounds on Twitter==

{{quote|I sure hope you're watching me Tweet about it, because I'm doing this as hard as I can.|ShardDax}}
<br>
{{quote|A month, [[lie|for deleting spam on a page and removing something from my talk page]]? What the hell? [[BAWWWW|I have projects, articles in wait, A PORTAL...]]|ShardDax|how will ED survive without him?}} 
<br>
{{quote|@juniperjade Nah, Subseven's mad I'm deleting spam, therefore I'm "edit warring" or something. He needs to just fuck Icky and stop crying.|ShardDax|Strike Three, he talked himself into a year. [[Goodnight sweet prince]]}}
<br>
{{quote|It really is; looks like Subseven's having a nervous breakdown in real-time - RT @Thayora @shard_dax's talk page is hilarious|Right...}}
<br>
{{quote|Subseven, still reading my Twitter? Count how many Music EDitors ED has now? Was it still wise you banned me for reverting a spammer? #lulz|ShardDax|learned absolutely nothing from [[EDS1]]}}
<br>
{{quote|Hey Subseven, told ya that you misunderstood me. Think I'm white-knighting for EDS1 when really I just think Metokur is fail-troll central?|ShardDax|Totally not [[whiteknight]]ing [[EDS1]], he's just very concerned about [[lol|a troll site with 5 active users]]}}
<br>
{{quote|Because, we all know that #internets are #srsbzn and all, and that deleting one loser's spam is totally white-knighting for someone you h8|ShardDax|because people always write songs in defense of "[[Talk:ED_Singers|someone they h8]]"}}

==The End?==

'''Eventually his ban was lessened to a week, but not before he issued this hilarious ultimatum:'''
