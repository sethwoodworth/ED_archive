[[Image:Wolfilol.png|thumb|right|A summary of Inflatablewolfi's art.]]

'''Inflatablewolfi''' is a furfag who claims to be a [[13 year old boy|17 year old]] German boy, but has the mental development of a 3 year old [[Americunt]]. He likes to post his unpolished turds he calls "art" to [[FurAffinity]], where they tend to blind anyone who looks directly at them. Inflatablewolfi claims that it's [[MS Paint]]'s fault that his pictures look so [[shitty]], but this turned out to be false after he posted some stuff he drew by hand, which somehow managed to be a step ''down'' from his digital stuff. He is also recognized as one of the internets biggest morons.

Wolfi believes that there is absolutely ''[[bullshit|no reason]]'' for people to make fun of furries, because they do "much more as just [[yiff|yiffi]] and are peacefull too". This is however slander and lies, since everyone knows that all furries are sick minded [[pervert|perverts]] who want to get their small furry testicles off on [[Digimon|Agumon]]. Of course, nearly every single piece of 'work' he's produced has something to do with his unmissable inflation fetish, deeming himself an "Inflatafur".

Because Wolfi is [[Hitler|German]], his English is really, ''really'' awful, and would like help with it. Because Wolfi is slow witted in nature, it's suggested you take advantage of this, and teach him such [[facts]] as "Castration is a food", i.e. "I'd like one castration with cream cheese", something we can all agree that he desperately needs.

==His Boyfriend, Quicksilver==

[[Image:I_love_me_by_QuicksilverTheWolf.jpg|thumb|His fugly boyfriend.]]

Wolfi also has an e-boyfriend named Quicksilver, who writes [[emo]] poetry and draws shitty artwork like his lover, although it's nowhere near as bad as Wolfi's stuff. He complains that he was [[Fursecution|fursecuted]] by his parents, as if someone's ''forcing'' him to be a furry. Because Wolfi has no regard for others' well being, he willingly gave up Quicksilver's information to a complete stranger. This might be due to too much air going to Wolfi's head.

Quicksilver has also revealed that he doesn't mind if his love [[sluts]] around with other furries, as long as there's "no touching", and it "doesn't mean anything". Despite the fact that going behind his back for [[yiff|yiffs]] would surely constitute that it ''does'' mean something, Quicksliver is a sad, lonely human being who clings to his status of being In a relationship in order to feel worthy of living. When the two break up, it's likely that Quicksilver will become [[an hero]], due to the grief of not having someone to make e-love to. [[Linkin Park|CRAAAWLING IN MY FUUUUR! THIS FURSECUUUUTION WILL NOT EEEEEND!]]

Soon, the world will weep as this furfag celebrates his eighteenth year avoiding a wood chipper demise. His parents, already grossly disappointed with raising a complete failure, are sure to get a shock before they legally throw him out of their house.  Quicksilver apparently is planning on coming out of the closet to his parents while everyone eats birthday cake and tripe.

<center>{{morphquote|mqtest|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;

|The biggest day of my life is rapidly approaching.

In november i will be celebrating my 18th birthday, but there is a catch. ><
I have secretly invited a few furry friends from uk and ireland. u know who u r. On this special day i am not only gonna be 18, but i will also be coming out and telling my parents and family that i am gay and am a furry.

The few furs i am inviting have ofered morral support for this occasion. There is still someone else i wish to invite but am not sure how to get them here or if they r even able to come.

Another thing is, someone else that has been invited, no one knows who it is except themself but this person is the guest of honour and if things do not go as planned with my parents, they have offered a temporary place in their home for me. but i am uncertain on how i will manage all the preperations. It truely is a day that will go down in history for my family and in my life. i will be the first gay member of my familt ever. Its kinda strange but i am proud, so wotever happens i am ok.|[http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/199225/ QuicksilverTheWolf].

|ok....
i dont wanna upset anyone or cause any trouble.
this is aimed at many people but also to one person mainly.

i been in a bad way lately and feel real bad.
this is why i dont want any relationship or anyone.

i just wanna be left alone by everyone unless they r told otherwise.

i just dont feel up to anything especially not a comitted relationship or people to worry about.


hope i have not dissapointed anyone but this is just how i feel and im sorry. :(|[http://quicksilverthewolf.deviantart.com/journal/14711555/ QuicksilverTheWolf].

|my life has once again changed so i have decided to get my leathers, get another style, smash a few items and get back into old habbits.

i am protesting against lies, stupidity and mistreating others, i am sick of people playing me for a fool so have decided to do something about it. the new poem is how i want this world to turn out. the corruption has already started thanx to certain idiots in this world and the end is near. figting and violence is beggining to dominate humanity and i bet it is eventually goin to lead to another stupid war. i do not want to be a part of this, i just want to watch the human race make a fool of itself.

i know i sound kinda lame right now but i really dont care, this is who i am and how i feel, if u dont like it then u can just rot for all i care.

good day to u all!|[http://quicksilverthewolf.deviantart.com/journal/15058449/ QuicksilverTheWolf].

==Literary Masterworks==

Not satisfied with merely assaulting the vision of those who look at his artwork, Inflatablewolfi has crossed over into the literary world.  The impact upon academia was felt immediately.  Though he states this is his story, it is part of a public domain website.  This four chapter opus is on the level of any of the greats.  It is also true, according to the furfag.


<div style="height:200px; overflow:scroll;">
''Steilas end of Life''

A Story of Steila wich goes along his last hours of his life before turning with a left Soul to a toy.

chapter one

Something wrong

Wolfi swimms and enjoys his time in the pool and wondered about Steila. e were normaly already at home but nope he were not here, not there... nowhere to find. So he started to worry about his friend and decided to take a visit  arround the house. Wolfi gets out of the pool, drys self and at no spot where his friend wich makes him sare. "Steila please be okay and don't say ur going to end ur life!" wolfi shouted scared. But at the door he saw him lie down sleeping all tired since he were unmoveable. Wolfi took him inside, feeling pulse and listens to the Heartbeat but both were very weak. <Don't say please ur dieing> wolfi just had in mind and Steila opened eyes. "Wolfi my livetime is over my friend" steila said as he teared a lot sadly. "I'll make ur last time be the best ever my friend... i promise!" wich wanted to make true even that there is a chance to make the life go on ll the time, but Wolfi wants back his toy.

chapter two

time for fun the last time

"May we play with some balloons and other cute toys, please?" steila asks with a sad sad look to wolfi and he just nods meaning he will use more as just balloons. "I hope you will like the place we are going my cute friend" he said as steila blew up a belly in exitement. he took steila on the back and walked outside making steila more and more happy. Soon they went through a portal as they end up in a great area just made for balloonies and so steila felt totaly happy. He played arround till he fell on ground "My legs and body even tail and head won't react anymore so i cannot move anymore >_< please help!" and whimpers. But wolfi runs over and cares bout his friend. Time went over fast and faster and as they went home steila glowed all over more and more.

chapter three

the time to change anything

Wolfis worries increase and steilas crieing aswell. "It is time to change" steila says as he lies down with all four away and glowed fast and even faster. "My friend you will renember me and that we had so much fun... but i always care about you don't forget." wolfi just left in pure sadness. Steila glows completely all longthen turns back as his body starts slowly to turn like a small and helpless toy but with a change. The paws are gone the body shifts anthro whole, the tail keeps having a bow and reaches a cute look.  He waggles his new tail and murrs all over with his all new apperance as a toy balloonie with maincolour red. as he fell down as toy he squeaks cute and smiles at wolfi. "Ur my toy again and this time i take better and much more care friend" is said so he picks up steila and cuddles leavin the normal room to go into toyroom one more time.

chapter four

a toy and friend forever

The times are happy as steila is much cuter as before. Wolfi enjoys to play with him more as before even that a darker being started to walk along wich scared both and the onliest ope is to change it one day.

To go along with this, the furfag wrote another story and put it through babelfish's free translator.  It is guessed that the furfag wanted to be well read.  The story, titled ''back to home'' apparently "is a with translater translated german story i wrote bout wolfi and his way back home."  Wonderful.


<div style="height:200px; overflow:scroll;">
''Sadness to home''

However, Wolfi remained zuhaus and his plastik schmilztvor to itself there. Tears fllen from his snout, thought around a thing he misses, none is absent dear in seite and something. Wolfi decided to proceed in the pool and to cool. " Everything always the same one. Why I am punished with these planets?! Nevertheless, I want only home! " were Wolfis worte. When to curse he anfänt, nevertheless, he did not note what was right. Steila was not there, nobody knock, nobody ring and not even providing ones shouts.

Wolfi walked long and saw luckily being ighspeedBike cc600 which are quick and cool. " I look around me better, because everything is new, and I have zeit befor home I go there for good and always zeit has for it. " .

==Trolling Wolfi==

[[Image:Inflatablewolfi_objects.jpg|thumb|Wolfi objects to this article!]]

[[Image:Sweet_little_lies.JPG|thumb|Wolfi's friends enjoy telling him sweet little lies.]]

On July 29th, [[User:Pokchu|Pokchu]] came across Wolfi's fail affinity and immediately began broadcasting it across the #ed IRC, leading to an increase in lulz intake. Noticing a YIM handle (which is '''wolfi_the_wulf''', real fucking creative), various [[EDiots]] decided to contact Wolfi to extract [[lulz]]. The results were nothing short of amazing.

'''Pokchu's Conversation'''

Pokchu, the first to contact Wolfi, had a lulz filled RP session Wolfi that eventually degraded into something so horrifying, it caused many EDiots to shit bricks. Guest starring [[Seaking]], [[Will Smith]], and [[EFG]] as themselves.

'''Dwerb's Conversation'''

[[User:Dwerb|Dwerb]]'s conversation wasn't nearly as lulzy, but it still yielded some pretty entertaining chat logs.
<div style="color: black; background-color: white; width: 575px; border: thin black solid; padding: .5em;">
:Dwerb: Hey, man.
:Dwerb: What's up?
:wolfi_the_wolf: just furryhaters made something against me and my mood is all down nothing
:Dwerb: Aww... what did they make?
:wolfi_the_wolf: all lies about me
:Dwerb: Can you show me?
:Dwerb: I'm an inflatafur too, you know.
:wolfi_the_wolf: cool
:Dwerb: so... what did they write about you?
:inflatable wolfi: look at the link i gave u
:Dwerb: you didn't give me a link...
:inflatable wolfi: http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Inflatablewolfi
:Dwerb: Oh...

:[[Inflatablewolfi/Logs#Dwerb_Conversation|'''((Read moar?!))''']]
</div>

'''Dwerb's Reveal'''

[[User:Dwerb|Dwerb]], after some encouragement, realized that roleplaying with this [[furfag]] could yield no more [[lulz]]. This is the result of his betrayal of the ultimate furfag.

<div style="color: black; background-color: white; width: 575px; border: thin black solid; padding: .5em;">

</div>

'''ZombieG's conversation'''

[[User:ZombieG|ZombieG]] took a different approach as opposed to the others, and decided to pose as a reporter from [[Fox News]]. Because Wolfi's mommy hasn't taught him not to talk to [[pedophile|strangers]] yet, Wolfi willingly tells Zombie everything without question.

And, as we know, FurCum rots the brain, blurring the obvious connection between Shoop Da Whoop and Phill Shoopman.

<div style="color: black; background-color: white; width: 575px; border: thin black solid; padding: .5em;">
:philshoopman:	hello
:philshoopman:	i am from America, my name is Bill Shoopman.

:philshoopman:	I read that they have made an article on you, is this true?
:wolfi_the_wolf: yes
:wolfi_the_wolf: http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Inflatablewolfi

:wolfi_the_wolf: on internet? no
:philshoopman:	We're an American news media group.
:philshoopman:	We've been following up on this, and we're looking for people to testify so we can :dismantle them.

[[Image:Wolfi_lulz_journal_5.PNG|thumb|Wolfi, proudly displaying that he has no friends.]]
==The Contest==

Recently, Wolfi created a journal entry on his Fag Affinity where he announce he was starting an art contest. This contest has been popular among the [[shit|better]] artists. Thinking he could match up to the other popular furfags, he decided to give it a shot. So far, his only responses have made fun of him, and responses of [[DO NOT WANT]] from the community.

So far, there's been two entries, and it's highly advised you witness [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/733620/ the one that's not deleted]. Because Wolfi has no friends, Chicago-LOLLIE won the contest, and subsequentially, the internets (or just the furry part). How Wolfi could be so incredibly stupid as to not realize that [[loli|Lollie]] was mocking him is a mystery.

==Butthurt==
Shortly after being trolled, Wolfi experienced a severe case of [[butthurt]], as it soon became hip and trendy to rag on him. Because the internet is Wolfi's only friend, he acted like the internet hates him, completely missing the fact that he's a ginormous lulzcow.

Sometime around Christmas 2007 Chicago-Lolli was at it [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/958664/ again]; however, this time round Inflatablewolfi had disappeared from FurAffinity, but he did give an update on DA about him leaving the fandom. Wolfi saw the flash four months after it was posted and everyone forgot it existed, suffered major butthurt from the flash, and went batshit insane on the world.

{{quote|Someting you should gte known of:

The word 'Pledicine' had become a hit and everyone quoted the threat as if it were a meme. [[bullshit|Inflatablewolfi's dad Jürgen then hijacked his account and attacked everyone]] for making his son gay.

[[Image:LAKICOLFtrollwarning.jpg|thumb|right|ANTHROS ARE MYTHOLOGY GUIS]]
[[Image:LakicolfINTERNETPOLICE.jpg|thumb|right|If you fuck with Laki, he'll call the police]]

Wolfi's attempt to get the heat off his heels was nearly successful, but his bullshit disappearance was quickly thwarted when crack lulz scientists found a possible second identity for the furfag.  Spelling errors between both accounts are numerous, as are the english and german style stories.  Lakicolf also posts that he is a "fur with a dark past", further fueling the thoughts that not only has this piece of untalented shit attempted an escape, but that the amusing posts of his father were merely a diversion that he created.

He also fails to remember that he titled two other shitty stories after his banned username and posted them to the Lakiwolf gallery.
