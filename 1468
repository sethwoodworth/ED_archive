Chemistry, in a nutshell, is the science of mixing two brightly colored fluids just to watch them explode.

==History of Chemistry==
[[Image:Etoh.jpg|thumb|Ride the horsie.]]
Chemistry is a [[science]] that assists in the manufacture of drugs, explosives, and pottery.  Without modern chemistry, the entire human race would have [[britfag|rotten teeth]], a 30-year life expectancy, and no beer, which is much the same as being English, but with no beer. The best to ever come from chemistry is LSD, the worst to ever come from chemistry was hippies. Which proves that with every [[win]], comes [[epic fail]].

===[[Alcohol]]===
EtOH is a good friend of ours.  The ancient Egyptians [[win|brewed the first beer]], regardless of what those [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer#Early_beers dirty nips say].  [[Nazi|German chemists]] perfected the art shortly after, and it's been tasty lulz ever since, except in Iran, where the process was needed primarily for the production of [[soap|biological weapons]] and [[alcohol|date rape drugs]].

===[[Drugs]]===
Chemistry is a most important part of [[fun|drugs]].  As shown [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/chemicals.shtml here], chemistry is a helping hand on the path to responsible and effective [[lulz|drug use]].

===[[bomb|Explosives]]===
Without chemistry, armed warfare would be relegated to sticks and rocks.  For great justice, be sure to take video of any bomb-making ventures!

===Pottery===
Pottery was invented [[atleast 100]] years ago by a [[raghead|scholar]] from Egypt.  The early Egyptians noticed that dirt, when wet, can become useful.  ''THIS IS CHEMISTRY!''  These innovations in early chemistry prove especially useful after the creation of drugs.

==DIY Chemistry==
===Grow some felonious crystals, dude!===
How to make great looking crystals!
* You'll need around 5-7 pennies (or copper coin from your country) and a straw, put these aside.
* Get a clear jar, scoop 2 tablespoons of salt into it, and 1 tablespoon of baking soda.
* Now the first important ingredient should be in the bathroom cleaning supplies: Ammonia (any brand). Pour it in until the jar is 2/3 of the way full (as tall as you want the crystals to grow)
* The last ingredient is laundry bleach(careful not to spill on your clothes!), fill the rest of the jar.
* Now drop the pennies into the bottom, and quickly take the straw and blow bubbles onto the pennies to get the crystals going. You should begin to see stringy crystals form after about 30 seconds of blowing. Thatâ€™s it!
* It takes about 10 minutes of steady blowing
* The pink and purple come from the production of Copper Caliphate(CuCO2)using the CO2 in your own breath! (blowing until you're dizzy actually increases the CO2 in your breath, giving better colors)
Good luck!
* Hide from [[the man|the fed]], peer out the windows looking for the secret service. Its been illegal to process coins ever since [[you|the US government]] got so deep in debt, the metal in its coinage is worth more than the coins themselves.

===Applied Chemistry===
Chemistry is full of [[winrar]] - don't [[fail]] it. Follow this guide on how to make chemistry work for ''you''!

* [[Lol|Isopropyl Alcohol is a fantastic for hydration, and can get you drunk if the liquor store is closed.]]
* [[Retard|Hydrochloric acid has the same effect as]] [[Lemon Party|Viagra.]]
* [[Kool-Aid|Hydrogen Cyanide is an excellent good sleep aid.]]
