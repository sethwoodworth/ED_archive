By now, everyone knows breastfeeding is a good thing. It's better for the baby, it's better for the mother, it's better for the environment, it's better for everyone except formula companies and the husbands who have to deal with their wives' saggy fried-egg-hanging-on-a-nail [[titties]] (a situation made all the worse because that stupid prick doctor wouldn't sew [[cunt|it]] up a little tighter).

But what about breastfeeding a [http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1630214.html toddler]? Or your [http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1628298.html dying mother]? What about [http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1615760.html ranting] [http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1615258.html about] [http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1619093.html breastfeeding] [http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1620397.html as portrayed] [http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1620524.html on TV]? Or about people who don't want to see your tits in [http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1612981.html public]? 

Luckily, 
{{ljcomm|user=boob_nazis}} is here for you! It's the perfect place to brag about your super-crunchy [[pop parenting]] techniques and [[Booju mooju|wangst]] about how [http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1626783.html?thread=18224287#t18224287 formula should be available by prescription only] and [http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1614575.html?thread=17956335#t17956335 you can never feed a baby anything but breastmilk]. Start a grassroots revolution to end the formula companies' evil schemes to [http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1612750.html#cutid1 brainwash women into formula feeding]! [http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/41630768/462726 Don't forget] to [[tits or leave|post plenty of pictures of your boobs]]! And what child-rearing community would be [http://community.livejournal.com/boob_nazis/1616269.html complete] without [[nouglybabies|waffle drama]]? And all this in the span of two weeks!

Don't have a baby before being thoroughly indoctrinated by the boob nazis. Your ten-year-old milk sucker will thank you!

'''Nipplegate''' was the bannination of [[hippies|breastfeeding mothers]] from [[LiveJournal]] for having user icons depicting breastfeeding.  It sparked major outrage from [[boob nazis]] across the Internets.
