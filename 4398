Jojo is the [[Jailbait|underage]] [[Emo|emo]] star of Blue Sky Studio's newest CG film, <em>Horton Hires a Ho</em>, based on Dr. Seuss' epic trilogy of novels by the same name. Apparently [[Retard|deaf and dumb]], Jojo has nonetheless garnered a huge fan following of people who appreciate his [[weeaboo|WAI WAI KAWAII]] nature and soft, dark emo heart.

Nevermind that the kid is underage, just check out that [[furry|sexy fuzzy body]]! Who wouldn't want to date that?
