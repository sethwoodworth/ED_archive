It's slowly coming this way!
{{spoiler|THIS HOLE WAS MADE FOR ME}}

[[Image:Amigara.jpg|thumb|center|525px|How it all started (or ended, rather).]]
'''It's slowly coming this way!''' is an occasional meme from [[4chan]] and [[7chan]]'s [[/x/|/x/]]. It has its origin in a horror [[manga]] by Ito Junji called ''The Enigma of Amigara Fault'', one of two side-stories to the [[sick fuck|epically fucked up]] masterpiece ''[[Gyo]]''.

In the story, a [[West Virginia|backwoods]] part of [[Japan]] is smashed to shit by <s>Godzilla</s> an earthquake, and the damage reveals a fault line in a mountain full of ancient holes in exactly the shape of people, thousands of meters deep. Anyone that sees these [[goatse|people-shaped holes]] have an irresistible urge to [[anal|get inside]] them (they actually say [[LOL WUT|"I came here to look for my hole"]]), where they disappear, coming out the other side of the mountain...well [[you]] get the picture.

The original story was ridiculously scary in true [[The Ring|J-Horror]] tradition (claustrophobics too stupid to not peruse [[eyeburn|tore out their own eyes]] after reading), even if it has by this time [[This is why we can't have nice things|been totally ruined]] by [[your]] friends on the [[*chans]] and their propensity to turn [[X is now a meme|anything into Internet crap]].
