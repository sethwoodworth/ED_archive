Bash.org
[[Image:Bash.jpeg|right|Description]]
Bash.org is a web site that hosts a surprisingly [[Lame|popular]] database of quotes from [[IRC]]. It is a spin-off of the original QDB (quote database) on [http://www.geekissues.org GeekIssues.org]. Submitting a quote is sometimes referred to as "bashing".

Bash.org collects, stores and presents [[Unfunny|humorous]] (i.e. [[racist]] and [[Gay|homophobic]]) quotes garnered almost exclusively from [[Internet Relay Chat]], although some entries from instant messaging and spoken quotations appear in the database.

Quotes are submitted to bash.org through a web form, where they are then kept for [[Mod|moderation]]. If they are deemed worthy of being in the database (that is, they [[Lie|make sense]], they are at least [[Lie|slightly funny]], they are not overly [[Penis|long]], the quote number is not a prime, [[Shit nobody cares about|and the amount of rain that fell in Krasnoyarsk the previous day is less than 5 cm]]), the quotes are then placed on public display. 

The site's ease of quote submission means that large amounts of quotes are submitted every day, and the number of approved quotes in the database (including those with negative scores) is [[Over 9000|20,440]] (as of March 10, 2008). Bash.org is immensely popular among [[basement dweller]]s, so much so that the site's maintainers intermittently send out [[Asking for it|requests for new hardware to be donated]] (which often occurs).

The topic of the databases quotes are largely "[[nerd]] humor," and the [[Unfunny|comedy value]] of the database is enhanced if the reader is computer literate. The intended audience of the QDB is people aged 16 and over. Unfortunately, this includes [[16-year-old girl]]s who browse the site and feign computer literacy with their [[LJ]] friends; quotes may contain any combination of explicit language, adult themes, sexual references and allusions to drug use. This is amply mocked by [http://www.bash.org/?230936 one quote], according to which you need just mention "masturbation, child pornography, racism, and [[Dungeons and Dragons]]", or say "Bash.org" and your favorite ethnic slur a lot, and the quote will get into the database.

It's a good place to [[Goatse|redirect]] someone to who hasn't read [[lies|quotes]] before and wants to know what they might be. For the rest of us, the top quotes remain the same for [[at least 100|at least 100 years]]; still, they're [[old|classics]]. The page is just so alive as it seems in the frontpage.

In July of 2004, the original moderators of bash.org went on strike in an attempt to get the management to either develop new features or appoint an individual with that responsibility. After being [[banned|fired]] by the bash.org management, the [[old|senior]] moderators moved to [http://www.QDB.us QDB.us].

Overall, the site provides some [[lulz|lulz]], as the site creator is willing to [[Pedophile|emotionally destroy small children]] and their [[Porn|artwork]].

    <Hef> correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't holy water just water that has a prayer said over it?
    <Tribolthree> holy water is water blessed by a priest, nothing special or added -_- technically he could bless the water coming from a pipe
    <Tribolthree> so like you could have a fountain of holy water
    <Hef> the priest would probably get tired of the constant blessing
    <Hef> and run out of mana
Did you see that?? I just fucking came! So [[Fail|epic]]!

    <Costilled> "Try our new pepperoni pizza!"
    <Costilled> and I'm left thinking

    <Costilled> so I kick the guy in the throat
    <Costilled> and take his wallet
    <Mystech> o.o out
    <Mystech> Or ouch
    <Mystech> depending on how weirdly my brain is functioning tonight.

    <Costilled> don't get me started on deer
    <karass> i wont
    <karass> sorry i brought it up
    <Costilled> but the pizza was hand tossed
    <Costilled> the cook could have tossed off in the dough and we wouldn't know
    <Mystech> Well like didn't you watch him make the dough, too?
    <Costilled> He was kneading the dough as only a hooter girl could understand
    <Costilled> you know if they drop the dough while tossing it, your pizza is free
    <Mystech> Wow, man, that's deep.
    <Costilled> Did you know
    <Costilled> you can no longer get a pitcher of soda at pizza hut
    <Costilled> ?
    <karass> *gasp*
    <Costilled> your refills are free
    <karass> ive never gotten a pitcher of soda at pizza hut, so i dont think im terribly put off by the bad news
    <Costilled> they just don't want you hording the soda
    <Mystech> hehe
    <Costilled> the glasses are rediculously small however
    <Mystech> Arizona is the state of free refills.
    <Mystech> all refills are free.
    <Costilled> A smurf would get caught by his knickers if he decided to go for a swim
    <Mystech> uhhhhh. . . huh?
    <Costilled> and remember, it's never polite to place your tip to the server by aiming coins into his buttcrack
    <Mystech> O.o  It's not polite for your server's buttcrack to be showing.
    <Costilled> I didn't care
    <Costilled> I was tipping him with the money I got from the guy I kicked in the throat
    <Costilled> nevermind the fact that it was canadian
