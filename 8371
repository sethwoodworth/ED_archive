They
[[Image:BearS.jpg|thumb|They are furries]]
As a necessary counterpoint to [[We]], there is '''[http://www.livejournal.com/users/pallasathene8/48720.html They]''', otherwise known as [[Faux News]]. 

''They'' is perhaps the smartest person ever, and the perfect person to cite in an argument.

''They'' was also a horrible movie about sleep disorder monsters by the guy who made Scream and the Freddy Krueger movies.  [[Everyone dies]] in that one.

''They'' make everything.

''They'' also refers to '''[[Native_american|chugs]]'''.

[[Kevin Trudeau]] knows all of the information that ''they'' don't want you know about.

==They Live==

''They'' are the nebulous group of philosophers, artists, inventors, scientists, economists, businessmen, and bureaucrats that completely control everything.  ''They'' are working on the next greatest invention.  ''They'''ve just come up with new technologies.  Their studies show that oxygen may be linked to cancer and that living may lead to dying.  ''They'' are the inane desk jockeys that plague your phones, and ''they'' are the public servants that save your hide.  ''They'' own every company and control the economy - the market rises and falls on their collective word.  ''They'' encompass all ideologies and ethnic groups.  ''They'' command every point of view except yours.  ''They'' fight wars amongst themselves, and have enough time on the side to oppress you.  ''They'' are both the aliens abducting humans, and the secret society opposed to those actions.  ''They'' are the secret police listening to your conversations, the hackers monitoring the internet, the conspiracy theorists both legitimate and insane and the guerrillas fighting the so-called power - power which ''they'' back up.  ''They'' are many, and you are but one.  And you know what ''they'' say...

''They'' are everywhere.  

Don't believe me?  Look for yourself, and know you can fight back:

==Example==
*Prima: ur gay
*Secunda: They say people who use gay as an insult are likely trying to hide their own urge to stick a penis [[in the ass]].
*Prima: well, ur a [[furry]].

'''and so on...'''
