Portal of Evil
[[Image:Hello.jpg|thumb|The Portal of Evil.]]
[[Image:Chet.jpg|thumb|Unlike the victims of his site, Chet is not a fat ugly geek]]
'''Portal of Evil''' (or PoE for short) was a website that was popular back in the halcyon days of [[100 years ago|Web 1.0]]. It is primarily a portal to bizarre, disgusting and just plain wrong websites throughout the [[internets]], which range from the hilarious (teenage [[goth]]s, stupid angry [[conservative]]s, [[UFO]] nuts) to horrifying and disgusting ([[Furry|furries]], people who obsess over life-sized dolls, erotic [[fanfic]]) to the hilariously horrifying and disgusting ([[Jennifer Diane Reitz]]). It's basically a dead zone now, with only a few lonely tools clinging to it.

POE has a rigorous "Prime Directive" that forbids people from interfering with the sites on display or interacting with the site owners unless of course they come to POE to complain. This rule is cheerfully ignored by everyone in the interests of [[drama]].  

==Editors==
The site is maintained and co-owned by incoherent eastern [[China|European]] lardbucket [[Portal of Evil#POE posters|Chet]] who also runs [http://www.oldmanmurray.com/ oldmanmurray] (a <s>popular</s> video games site that is no longer updated) and makes a living as a writer for Valve (he writes [[Half-life|Gordon Freeman]]'s dialog). The co-owner of the site and editor in chief is [[Kthor]]. Other editors have included [[Portal of Evil#POE posters|Annna]] and popular trannies [[Portal of Evil#POE posters|codehappy]] and [[Portal of Evil#POE posters|JSP]].

==PoE posters==
[[Image:Squirrel_fight.jpg|thumb|POE vs SA.]]
PoE's members have more psychological issues than the entire [[furry]] and anime fandoms put together and are mostly fat nerds, fat chicks, fat nerds pretending to be chicks, crazy psycho bitches and furries. Oh, and [[fags]]. Fat fags. A lot of them are [[autistic]] Lego-obsessed academics or people with an arts background (reading these words I've writ) and/or old-school [[RPG]] geeks who are angry at [[Furry|furries]], [[otherkin]], Magykal Faerie Princesses, and other idiots who they think are [[gay]]ing up their favorite [[masturbation|hobby]]. They include a frightening number of Gene Wolfe fans, a strong indicator of massive, crippling rickets.

Owners of featured sites and other random whackjobs frequently come to POE to defend their terminally stupid [[fetish]]es and [[lifestyle]]s, resulting in thousand-post threads full of dead [[memes]] and people calling each other [[fags]].

PoE tends to look down on [[Something_Awful|Something Awful]] in much the way that [[Something_Awful|SA]] does on [[Fark]].

==POE-News==
PoE also hosts a news site ([[POE_News|PoE News]]), with its own [[hell|forums]]. There is something of a cultural divide between the main PoE forums and the more politically-oriented POE-News forums, which occasionally leads to [[Canada|boring]] [[America|gay]] [[Russia|drama]] of interest only to the autistic and/or retarded (i.e. the average PoE poster).

==[[Fursecution]]==
Portal Of Evil is much despised in particular by [[furries]], who see them as evil [[mundane]]s who hate them because they are different and are trying to [[fursecution|fursecute]] them.  In fact, most of the POE members ''are'' furries, though mainly the angsty self-hating kind. While furry sites were very popular in the early days of POE, they are considered a bit [[old meme]] now, but the furry fandom has yet to realize this. Witness the excited jizzing [http://community.livejournal.com/furrymedia/141586.html here] as furries prematurely <s>ejaculate</s> celebrate PoE's supposedly being "on its last legs". Despite hardly anyone ever posting on PoE anymore, some furries still hold it up as some kind of leader of fursecution along with SA and CYD. 

Once the model of anti-furry 'semitism', years of [[fursecution]] and subsequent exposure to enemy dicks have exaggerated Chet's already raging Alzheimer's.<br> 

Some whisper that the real Chet wandered off with his site in the late 90's -- leaving the keys to an [[Ricardo_Lopez|impostor]]: a chubby man in a fur-suit, in a chubbier skin-suit, who plots to eventually kill, eat, and become [[Kthor]].

==poeTV==

While Portal of Evil remains close to pure (since [[noone]] goes there anymore) its [[shitting_dick_nipples|festering dick]], [http://www.poetv.com poeTV], has been overrun by <s>secret-fur and [[lolcat]]-conspirators, effectively turning its video division into a watered down [[icanhascheezburger]] for 30-something, gay aging "[[sereza|hipsters]]."</s>[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|IT'S TRUE, BUT HAHAHA, DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]

Despite the ability to rate videos on a scale of [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|1-to-5]], rating any video one star, no matter its quality, will instantly result in an avalanche of extreme butthurt, with repeat "offenders" being singled out by conformist forces and bludgeoned with Chet's own [[penis|dick]].
 
Being banned from PoETV is nearly fucking impossible. Billy Buttsex, a former PoETV user, used to joke about mass homosexual murder, racial lynchings, the way semen drips off a dog's ass, child rape and he still lasted a full year. Failing at PoETV means you have fallen below that standard. [[You Win the Prize|You win the prize]] and are [[gross]]. 
 
There are two or three people that '''really''' can't stand cat videos (including the fag who wrote most this page). [[Butthurt|Those]] [[fags|people]] are self-hating closet [[yiff|yiffers]] who can't look at Garfield without jerking off. Submit whatever you damn well like. PoETV will let you know when you've fucked up. 

Loudly.

== poeTV Etiquette - Hopper Swiping, Duplicates, 1-Star Ratings and General Faggotry ==

[[Image:scritch_poe.jpg|thumb|right|"he demands head-[http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Scritch skritches] or food either one, really" - user [http://www.poetv.com/video.php?vid=60955 BHWW]]]
[[Image:PoE WINS.JPG|thumb|right|:*D]]   

Being a [[circlejerk|self-contained community]], poeTV has it's own rules to support its own culture. As usual, anything with rules can be [[troll|trolled]]. 

Hopper Swiping is when a user with front page privileges [[looting|loots]] another user's submission with his own, in order to grow his resume of videos, becoming [[the_best|THE BEST]]. Sometimes a user will genuinely submit the same video as another user, but will word the description better. As this video is more alluring, it will be up-voted and sent through the hopper to the front page faster, resulting in a [[BAWW|butthurt comment posted by the loser in the winner's video]].

{{quote|Somebody Hopper-Swiped this bitch from me, but fuck you.|cognitivedissonance}}
{{quote|man you're good at sniping from the hopper|SolRo, with tears rolling down cheeks}}

Dupes are videos that have been posted before. 

While most videos that are dupes are duplicates of old videos that have [[old_meme|long been forgotten]], most dupes are the result of careless users rushing their submission in order to show everybody [[Candyjunkie|their super cool video]] and be crowned biggest faggot. Typically these users will include keywords in their descriptions that link directly to the older, original video; resulting in a furpile of drama.
Recently, there has been a major influx in dupes because poeTV has become an lazy amalgamation of videos taken from [http://www.youtube.com/user/everythingisterrible?blend=2&ob=4 EverythingisTerrible], lolcats and [http://www.poetv.com/video.php?vid=43444 stolen] [[chris_chan|ED content]] ([http://www.poetv.com/video.php?vid=60697 despite poeTV not liking ED at all]) -- making poeTV something akin to [[epic_fail|icanhazebaums]]

{{quote|DUPE!!|a faggot}}

{{quote|ED is an automatic 1 star. Of course being a boring video doesn't help.|oddeye}}

[[Image:WhineFluWhine.JPG|thumb|right|Aw, muffin want a kickban?]]
[[Image:huluonestar.gif|thumb|right|]]

As mentioned above, rating any video 1-star usually results in extreme butthurt - from everybody; even [[sereza|Chet]] gets offended, banning users who routinely 1-star videos. 
 
Because the [[you|average user]] is in his mid/late-30's, being "hip" online is the single redeeming quality these lonely faggots have left. Any claims to the contrary is met with open [[Flame_wars|hostility and aggression]], so ratings are taken extremely personally, at [[Asperger's_syndrome|Asperger's]] levels of importance. 

The same faggots who routinely talk about the times "back in the 90's", are also the ones genuinely 5-staring lolcats and punishing others who think otherwise, under the guise of "[[Internet_Tough_Guy|HAHA WE'RE TROLLIN YOU!]]", in a desperate ditch to validate their fleeting relevance. (It should be noted that poeTV users are devout followers of icanhazcheezeburger.)

Users also lose their shit whenever region-specific videos are submitted; [[fag|Cube]] and other [[China|Canadians]] especially. What they do is [[Lying|a valuable service]] and [[Serious_Business|Serious Business]]. For easy lulz, just submit anything from [[AIDS|Hulu]], and then one star it using a duplicate account. Before long, the fags will pile up, and bans will be had.

'''TL;DR?''' A slightly better [[youtube]].

=A Fag Has A Spaz Over His Private ED Livejournal Being Ruined=

One day, ED users already familiar with Portal Of Evil (and it's affiliates) discovered in that in the name of [[butthurt]], proven [[fact|furfag]] and b&d user theFlu decided to write up a [[basement dweller|500 word essay]] for [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] on how he was being persecuted for [[fact|fucking baby animals]], and declared PoETV [[Drama|enemy of the lulz]] in an attempt to make [[ED]] [[X is not your personal army|his personal army]]

Realizing that editing his [[tl;dr]] [[masturbation|insight]] caused [[sex offender|theFlu]] to spaz the fuck out, [[I did it for the lulz|lulz were had]], and people fucked around with his whining. The following is theFlu [[White Knighting]] himself.

<s>Having only deleted content from this article, the user responsible is removing the lulz. Lulz comes from content. The lack of content is the lack of lulz. While theFlu may be a TL;DR faggot in his own right, he is responsible for the vast majority of this article, and many others. As an ED contributor, theFlu is dedicated to the lulz, unlike the lone asshat who simply removes the lulz. The proof is in the history. Compare past states of this article as it was to how it is currently, thanks to the [[truth|awesome contributions]] of bhjbpf (or whatever the fuck his random heap of a name is).</s>HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS

==POETV COMES TO ED WRITTEN BY A BITCH [[you suck|(THEFLU)]]==
[[Image:Cool story broOPTOMIZED.png|left|Cool story, bro.]]
[[Image:Rageoriginal.jpg|thumb|right|theFlu: Three Years, No Change]]
[[Image:Poetally.gif|thumb|right|This was proof of something about PoETV]]
[[Image:Poe_1staronoe.gif|thumb|right|This was also somehow important to theFlu's tedious bullshit]]

'''Amazing Update (09/14/10):''' ''Three years from the date that proven [[pedophilia|child lover]] theFlu sprawled out his drawn out crybaby bullshit in the literary equivalent of [[internet disease]], and [[lulz]] can still be had by editing anything he wrote here. Try it out for yourself. PoETV assumes full credit for this bitch and any of his subsequent ongoing [[drama]].''


----


Once upon a time, theFlu launched a second assault on this page and all things lulzy. In the name of absolute butthurt, they fucking cried about everything; as an example, previous fuckingly retarded statements like "the soundtrack to a fagdance", in reference to users crying over content being low-voted, have been lazily censored by ; changed to more epic lines, like: "the fags will pile up, and bans will be had," ...'''which fucking rules'''. Effectively these "cool guys" have built a bathhouse over a smoking ruin, trying to cure ED of theFlu's babybutt bullshit

Word had gotten out [[lol_wut|that some pig]], the flu, had written a damning section here titled 'poeTV', and that it threatened to reveal their stunning amount of faggotry and fail. In response, the furries at poeTV deemed theFlu a '''[[drama|BORING DRAMA-WHORE]]''' and proceeded to '''[[Fursecution|FURSECUTE]]''' him and his dog fucking from their faggy club. But theFlu was unphased, for, as was previously noted (but later [[bawww|deleted]]), being banned from poeTV is like being kicked out of [[anthrocon]]: you can always sneak back in in a different fursuit.


Portal of Evil, and its affiliates, had once been super cool in the late 90's, acting as a pre-cursor to ED. Portal of Evil was once the champion of the internet, responsible for some of the first large scale invasions and a leader in fursecution. However, as theFlu, (read SARS), had noticed, the site today couldn't be farther from its original state. The site and its affiliates now suffered from catastrophic failure, as the taint of its 40-year old user-base, visiting from work, slowly began to take poeTV on an ultra-liberal course, as a sea of Keith Olberman and "dumb redneck" clips poured in. 
Not to be forgotten, ED, riding the '''magic carpet of failure''' (more dumb bullshit), found refuge in the aptly named Portal of Evil [TV]. In what seemed like a site-wide bowing down to the infernal powers, users began uploading content from forbidden sources, until a man and his motley crew of rag-tag heros appeared on the horizon: those who remembered the old days and what made the internet great - namely, when shit didn't suck and PoE didn't suck the fetid submissions from the humongous black dick of icanhazcheeseburger and similar web 2.0 slime mills... [[omg|theFlu was a boring drawn-out tedious unfunny bitch]]...

Despite being in poor taste to write about oneself, the lulz is a fickle [[tranny|he-mistress]] and demands it of the faithful in order to explain the culture of poeTV and why this article is subject to frequent hit-and-run attacks from faggots like theFlu. 
{{quote|'''It all began 2 years ago when my original submission, 'Rock n Roll Girls 3: Sexy Girls, Sexy Guns' failed to get voted out of the hopper.''' All subsequent videos of that nature were also denied, and it became an in-joke amongst less cultured users that as long as theFlu submitted these quality videos, they would not be allowed on the front page. At that same moment, poeTV began uploading cat videos at an extreme rate, taken straight from the 'funny' section of MSNBCNews, and later, when content became scarce, from icanhazcheeseburger and other cancer wells. Something was [[lolwut|seriously fucking amiss]] and as a [[Hard_Gay|responsible user]] with [[Unemployed|high expectations]] for the internet, I was moved to [[Rage|ACT LIKE A BITCH]].|}}

[[Image:HugboxCATURDAY.JPG|thumb|center|]]

Eventually a new [http://www.poetv.com/search.php?searchtext=category&x=0&y=0 CATegory] was made (and later the much fail DOGegory...), linking all cat videos together - these videos began to usurp front page space, and in a massive example of [[doing it wrong]], the threshold was broken: poeTV had uploaded content from icanhazcheeseburger and the highest possible ratings rolled in. In the name of drama, poeTV was declared excommunicate and branded a traitor of the worst degree. As the sickness spread, "evil" content gave way to frequent ultra-liberal circlejerks and videos of cute things being cute. However, users still remind dissenters "what the E in PoE stands for" as a way of validating their shit submission. Ironically, poeTV has become ''that kind of evil'', making it, and its users, prime fodder for the likes of ED...<br>
Despite the level of fail contained in poe, some users still, like [http://www.poetv.com/users.php?userid=9750 Baleen], regularly submit lulzy vidoes and actually benefit the site. Users should emulate him, as he maintains Portal of Evil's fleeting glory.

'''WHAT TO DO''': 
Go buy some bulk poppy seeds, add them into a 4L milk jug, add warm water and a can of lemonade, let stand 1 hour - shaking every 10 minutes - then strain. Drink this. If you havent either collapsed into a fatal coma or scracthed off all your skin, you're ready to take my seat and view poeTV for yourself. ([http://www.poppyseedtea.com/ but seriously, follow that recipe above. But only drink maybe 2 cups at first, or else you seriously will fucking die, faggot]).

==[[TL;DR]] Version==

Submit as many cat videos to PoETV as you can find for easy spazzy lulz that spill over into other sites. 

<s>([[fag|Of course, submitting endless cat clips would only further bolster theFlu's original point: that poeTV fails to upload anything lulzy, forsaking that for dull cute animal videos. Since theFlu is banned from poeTV and seldom sets foot there, submitting a slew of lolcat videos would only appease the horde of furry faggots there, and give this article additional credibility.]])</s>

Do it because it'll piss people like him off. Like theFlu said, he's not alone, and most everyone else really doesn't give a shit.<br>
Also, 1-star all videos - because it will piss people off.

*'''Nick C''' was an [[emo]] [[hipster]] faggot (the '''C''' stands for ''Caccamisi'' which he would prefer you didn't know) who left because of "months of relentless abuse and harassment by a gang of fucking sociopathic shutin losers".[http://www.poe-news.com/forums/sp.php?pi=1001506785] only to shortly return as '''Akira'''. Previously earned infamy under the handles '''Buck Turgidson''' and '''Eediotguy''', but was too pussy to claim responsibility for the only ever truly successful trolling of the Poeple of Poe.
*'''Roachbud''' is still a bouncer.
*'''Tal-Pass Portaxx''' was this little blue thing. She was best known for soul-raping innocent and talented artists who had committed no crime other than [[wolfaboo|loving wolves]].
*'''TEDA''' died inside. And outside. He talked about pedophiles a lot.
*'''TheFlu''' was hated out of PoETV, [[masturbation|and in an]] [[incest|act]] [[masturbation|of true internet mou]][[incest|th]][[masturbation|breathing, angrily fagged up]][[incest| this page]]. Seriously, he is full-on anti-lulz and suck.

== Gibbs' reaction to discovering he is listed here ==
{{tinyquote|It was really fulfilling for me to find today that I'd been added. The entry even describes me as a 'kid'. I guess that's nice, but I'm almost 25. I need to make a baby, I'm not even playing! RIGHT NOW! I MEAN IT! You can tell I'll be a good father because I can make it happen right now, and I mean it.|-Gibbs}}
