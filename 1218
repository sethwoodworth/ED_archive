'''''Bullshido.net''''' is what you get when you combine the age level of [[GameFAQs]], the community of [[MySpace]] and the mentality of [[IMDb]]. The website is famous for being the unholy shithole that 50% of [[internet tough guys]] originate from. Although it [[Lie|claims]] to be a news site for martial arts topics and events,  it's actually just [[Facebook]] for [[Hackers on steroids|steroid-consuming asshats]]. Half of the topics are debating wet dreams over which professional [[Professional wrestling|UFC]] fighter could kick who's ass, and also flaming any purists who don't practice [[Gay|MMA]] because they are [[What|lol pussies!!!11]] Don't [[troll]] these elite fighters, they will [[Not|fuck you up IRL.]]

The web design of '''''Bullshido.net''''' is basically equivalent to that of an [[emo]] [[13 year old boy|14 year old]] on [[MySpace]]. Creating a page on Bullshido requires you to have at least 5 overlapping backgrounds, 24 images, 30 steroid advertisements, a font size that's bigger than your monitor resolution, and tons of colored text. [http://www.bullshido.net/forums/index.php Even if it's just the forum index.] Unless your computer has 8gb of RAM, you're either [[fucked]], or you have to close all your background processes, including the operating system, just to browse the website. And even then, it'll have more lag than the [[Modern Warfare 2|MW2]] [[LAN party]] you hosted in your [[basement]] last week, you pathetic [[You|waste of fuck.]]



==Community==

Most of the posters on the forums are hicks are rednecks who have no fighting skill outside of watching UFC and owning a pair of $6.00 [[Crap|Everlast]] handwraps. Common posts include losers recording themselves shadowboxing, [[trolling]], and talking about how much cooler [[Brazil|BJJ]] is than [[Homosexual|competitive wrestling]]. If you can somehow dodge past the 40 advertisements on the pages, you might even find a boxing glove review here and there. Of course these reviewers are the same [[Moron|morons]] who don't actually practice a martial art, and try to teach themselves Judo in their friend's garage by watching [[Elite|professional]] [[YouTube]] videos.

==Women==
[[Image:Bullshido_Women.PNG|thumb|right|180px|We have a forum dedicated to telling stories about fucking girls. Therefore, we are [[cool]].]]

[[Image:Bullshido_Prostitute.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Typical advice given on the forum.]]

If you thought recording your friends grabbing each other's asses in a basement while wearing Tapout shirts meant you had [[no life]], [http://www.bullshido.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=97 think again.] The board known as '''Liquors, Loot, and Ladies''' is basically the equivalent to <s>[[b|/b/]] on [[4chan]]</s> okay, maybe it's not THAT bad, but comes close. As the name implies, the forum is used to discuss topics relating to [[beer]], [[women]], and [[Money|cash]]. Obviously this is a false statement, as every [[Loser|forum poster]] in the world lacks a job, a girlfriend, and prefer to drink Mountain Dew-branded "Gamer Fuel" than any alcoholic substance. 

Despite the community claiming to be [[HARDCORE|BAMFs]], most of the threads you find here are by [[pussies]] crying over how their girlfriend broke up with them for playing too much [[Halo]]. Of course they don't actually say this, and replace it with something along the lines of [[Bullshit|"Yeah, my girlfriend wouldn't pick up my beer and M14 rifle from my truck, so I beat the fucking shit out of her and now she left. Fucking bitch."]] Analysts claim that this is the origin of the name '''''Bullshido''''', and others have [[Argue|disuputed]] that the entire forum is fake, because of the internet's [[There are no girls on the internet|rule 30]].

==Gong Sau Faggotry==
Bullshido has had a history of of [[Faggots | reasonable, intelligent adults]] challenging each other to a fight over the internet.  Unlike other sites, though, challenges to fights (dubbed Gong Sau) are taken seriously.

[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS]].  Almost no gong sau challenge ever actually happens, because [[Internet tough guy|Bullies]] are [[pussies]] who would rather [[STFU|talk]] than [[lose|fight]].  All the gong saus ever proposed on Bullshido so far fall into three categories:

* Shit gets talked, nothing happens.  This is almost always how it goes.
* If the fight is between a member of Bullshido and a non-member and the Bullshido guy [[Pwnt|loses]], there is a good chance that no video will ever make it to the Internet.  Example:  [http://www.bullshido.net/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=12650 a faygoat gets his ass wrecked by kung fu]:
{{tinyquote|[[Lie|Although I didn't feel them at the time]], now [[BAWWW|my shoulder is hurting from the axe kicks]], and [[Pussy|i'm unable to hold my right arm up]].

[[Duh|He consistently out punched me]] and snapped down my takedowns (I suspect he either [[Excuse me wtf r u doin|prepared extensively beforehand]] or wrestled) for about ten minutes, though [[Bullshit|I got in a few leg kicks]]. I [[Almost raped|pull guard/start buttscooting]] when [[Troll's remorse|one of the other black belts suddenly runs up to me to stop the fight]]. Turns out [[Period|my nose and lip were bloody]].|[[Faggot|Hedgehogey]], learning that kung fu hurts}}
{{tinyquote|Train hard, go back pwn them even harder.|[[Troll|Darting Fingers]], advocating for [[Suicide|a rematch]]}}
{{tinyquote|Hedge did extremely well. In the second match he was taking quite the beating, and he just kept coming back over and over. Really good spirit.|[[Enabler|TaeBo_Master]], giving Hedgey [[Sob story|credit]]}}
{{tinyquote|Also, for the record he at least five major cuts on his face, we had a hard time mopping up his blood all over our floor ... My student came to me and said I don't want to beat him any bloodier, what do I have to do to win this thing?|The kung fu master, laughing his ass off}}
:Man, I could use a video of that [[rape|fight]].  Couldn't you?
* In exactly three cases, there has been video of the fights.  Check out these [[Fail|awesome]] results:
** The first time, the people who said they wanted to fight [[coward|did not]], but two members of the posse got into a shoving match, and one of them got [[Buttsex|jumped from behind]] like the last twink in the [[gay]] bathhouse:<br /><br /><center><youtube>VYcyd5zOHKU</youtube></center>
** The second time, the whole thing went for less time than a [[shit|Subway]] sandwich in a fat man's hand, and the eleven-month student of [[gayness|Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] beat the 25-year [[kung fu]] "master".<br /><br /><center><youtube>gtl1myuoDH0</youtube></center>
** And the third time, some [[white man|cracker]] beat up an [[Azn]] about half his size.  It was [[bukkake|awesome]].<br /><br /><center><youtube>54w92HV0Jlg</youtube></center>

Whatever the result, no gong sau ever ends the underlying [[drama]]:

==Investigations==
[[Image:Haha-fuck-shit.gif|thumb|right|This is the man who investigates you, and these are your options when he does.  Choose wisely.]]

Bullshido likes to [[stalking|investigate]] [[fags|martial arts personalities]] they think are [[pussies]] or [[you|lying]].  Most of the time, is some [[retard]] wandering in and mumbling that maybe their local [[Korea|tae kwon do]] instructor is lying about being a [[Charlie Sheen|Navy SEAL]] or a [[Jackie Chan|world champion martial artist]].  Then other retards run in circles around the first one, either yelling at him to [[lie|prove it]] or telling him to [[suicide|kick the faker's ass]].  Nothing happens, nobody does shit, and life goes on.

One in a while, though, a [[Anonymous|concerned member]] will conduct a [[lynching|responsible investigation]] and expose the fake's [[pedo bear|private life]] for public amusement.  This will win the [[bastard|investigator]] [[Internet celebrity|wide renown]], [[over 9000|lots of rep]], and if he's really lucky, a [[banhammer]].  Because, [[srsly]], who wants that creep around?
