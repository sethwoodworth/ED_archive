[[File:MyspaceHQ.png|frame|center|'''MySpace 2010: A lonely, desolate place.''']]
Was used to serve as a hybrid of [[Friendster]] and [[LiveJournal]], '''MySpace''' (Pronounced: [[Old Meme]]) was initially invented for pedophiles, used to provide [[attention whores]] across [[the internets]] with twice the ability for tasteless [[shameless self promotion | self-promotion]]. MySpace was also a haven for middle-class suburban [[emo]] teenagers to whine and moan about how their lives are ''so'' "tough", even though they probably never got [[cock|one]] in the face. A typical persons MySpace page looked like this: http://www.myspace.com/fantasia49 . Notice the annoying music, the anime and [[hentai|"artistic"]] pictures, and the use of many quotes. Therefore, many [[lulz]] can be found within this site. Many [[troll]]ing groups, such as [[Penis Pump]], [[Getoffmyspace|deface MySpace]] pages for the lulz. MySpace was the cancer that brought us Boyce Avenue, a self-centered, untalented piece of whiny shit.

[[Image:Tompiss.jpg|thumb|This man has the right idea.]]

Originally, MySpace was created as a [[the game|game]] to see who could get the most friends [[internet|online]]. Unfortunately, the game grew immensely too popular and resulted in [[IRL]] [[drama]] and is now the leading cause in [[at least 100]] IRL [[an hero|suicides]]. The MySpace game has announced that the game will not be over until every teenager has become [[an hero]].

MySpace's "mission statement" is to function as a "meat market" for [[pedophiles|registered sex offenders]] to search for [[secret fatty|secretly fat]] [[16 year old girls]] and [[camwhore]]s who take it [[in the ass]] (once again, [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] knew this [[fact]] [http://www.kcra.com/news/6690006/detail.html months before it hit the wire]).

As a web site, it's a lethargically coded piece of [[shit]], rivaled in shittyness only by [[TagWorld]]; as a concept, it is a [[Nazi mysticism|scourge on the entire human race]] and the epitome of [[MTV|Western insolence]]. If one had food poisoning and shat diarrhea followed by puking two days' worth of half-digested food on top of it, the result would be more pleasing to look at, easier to navigate, less annoying and more substantive than [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=50716564 a typical MySpace profile] (especially since a puke+shit mix doesn't [[autoplay]] shitty music as soon as you look at it). 

However, as [[university|an institution of higher learning]] where [[stripper]]s , Bam, and [[porn|pr0n]] stars can learn [[HTML]], it is rivaled only by [[Harvard|DeVry University]].

It is also known by all [[Concerned Mother]]s and [[internet humanitarian]]s that, if you are on MySpace, you're gonna get a big black pedophile dick up you ass, despite your gender and appearance. If you don't have an ass, the pedophile will [[goatse|make one]]. [[Mission: MySpace|Very few]] have tried to stop this [[internets]] phenomenon. In [[At least 100 years ago|June 2008]], MySpace changed their nav bar to be easier to use by idiots. Millions of [[emo]] kids ended up [[butthurt]] and became [[An hero|an heroes]]. WAY TO GO!

Sadly, MySpace has died, and its grave is located in [[Failbook|Fapbook]] groups that are [[Cool|wiv da timz]]. Every [[Scene|scene ked]] has now had to join [[Failbook|Fapbook]] and use their real surname because Fapbook doesn't allow scene kids, and MySpace is lyk mega old and [[shit]].

===Founder===

[[Image:Tomisgay.jpg|thumb|Tom is a fucking [[tool]] for friending everyone on the internet.]]

[[Image:Tomfapping.gif|thumb|The not so widely seen [[gay]] side of every [[16 year old girls]] idol.]]

[[Image:Tombix.jpg|left|thumb|The much rarer, Bixnood Tom.]]

In [[2003]], MySpace was designed, edited, digested, and shat out onto the internets by [[Tom Anderson]], a [[cosplayfucks|crack baby]] and a kind of [[gay]] version of [[Brad]]. The two share many similarities, one of which is that they both [[sold out]] (see below). Tom has a taste for [[ADD|Adderall]] pixie sticks and a severe case of [[multiple personality disorder]]. As such, he created MySpace by combining the worst features of every so-called [[social networking sites|"social networking" site]] in existence in the most disorganized manner possible and adding horrifying features of his own. In reality MySpace is used to catalog all the [[fucktards]] (including [[you]]) in the world so they will be easily hunted down and ruthlessly assraped by Tom himself. He enjoys stroking kittens and eats Chinese people just for being chinks. According to the picture he is friends with [[Gary Glitter]] and [[Michael Jackson]].

===MySpace sellout===
On 23:54, 19 Jul 2005 (UTC), [[Rupert Murdoch]], owner of [[Fox News]], bought MySpace for 580 million dollars. Yes. [[Over 9000|$580 ''million'']]. Why a cesspool of mallcore [[faggotry]] is worth anywhere near that much [[It is a mystery|is a mystery]]. Meanwhile, the fine folks at [[liberal_(community)|liberal]] have [http://www.livejournal.com/community/liberal/2576910.html collectively shit themselves].

===imeem buyout ===
On December 9, 2009, [[Rupert Murdoch]] bought [[imeem]] for Jew<sup>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6770014/MySpace-buys-Imeem.html]</sup>, rendering the imeem app usless for countless number of [[13 year old boys]] and [[16 year old girls]].

==The Web's Unholy Chimera==

[[Image:Gaymyspace.PNG|left|thumb|Typical [[gay]] MySpace, warning [[trolls]] to [[GTFO]].]]

===Similarities to [[Friendster]]===
MySpace provides the benefits of adding friends in a [[Fake Your Space|desperate ploy]] to seem [[e-popular|popular]]. It also provides [[camwhore]]s with an amount of disk space to upload [[Internet disease|photos]]. This serves as a shrine to their own alleged [[hott]]ness.

Users can list general interests on their profile, such as their favorite [[music]], [[:category:movies|movies]], [[:category:TV Shows|television]], and [[old media|books]]. Well, not books. The last time anyone on MySpace touched a book was the day they dropped out of third grade.

Many users (usually dateless females) will list seemingly impossible qualities they are looking for in a [[people | humanoid life form]], such as the body of [[celebrity|Brad Pitt]], with [[Jack Sparrow|eyeliner]], and the soul of Truman Capote, but they also have to be a shirtless drummer in a band with no gag reflex. Also, they have to wear expensive crack [[shoes]] made from [[virgin]] alligators or some such [[shit]]. Such people usually carry hand sanitizer to spritz [[teh]] [[cock]] before giving it a really toothy [[blowjob]]. Lastly, notice most profiles are of people in [[California]]!

MySpace also provides a so-called [[BBS|bulletin]] feature similar to [[Friendster]], which allows users to post bulletins about [[ shit nobody cares about|local events and/or big news]], but the feature is only used to spread retarded [[meme]]s, emo pleas for new profile comments, irritating [[chain letter]]s, [[suicide]] notes, and announcements about the posting of new [[hot]] [[fat girl angle shot|photos]].

===Similarities to [[LiveJournal]]===

[[Image:Myspace_DRAMAmine.jpg|thumb|left|You're gonna need DRAMAmine.]]

MySpace offers a personal [[blog]], allowing users to rate their popularity by the number of [[comment]]s that are received. The difference between the blog feature and the bulletins feature is a closely-guarded trade sekrit known only to [[Tom]]. What is known is that Tom likes features. Lots of them.

The blog feature is often given a backseat to the posting of tiled blinking backgrounds with seven [[lens flare]]s on a user's profile page. When used, it is famous for [[eat]]ing posts, depriving the world of countless stories of sloppy blowjobs performed in nightclub parking lots. MySpace-post-eating is responsible for [[at least 100]] cases of [[cutting]]. Fortunately, subsequent photos of the wounds were posted without incident.

MySpace attempts to replicate LiveJournal's famed drama-friendly atmosphere, but due to its horrifying and utterly incomprehensible interface, drama is generated and maintained only through sheer force of will of the [[teenager|users]] generating it. MySpace also allows users to create communities, but [[lulz]] are rare due to the fact that [[English]] is never used.

Just like [[LiveJournal]], MySpace was awash in attention-starved [[nerd]] wannabes who believed that their emotions and self-righteous descriptions of themselves are more important than [[God]] Himself. They also say "black person" a lot, jokingly [[KKK|of course]]. That's because they have a black person in their top 8, and therefore, are not racist. MySpace was infested with [[fag|bitch boys]] who cry a lot and with [[bitch|fag hags]] who use the word "[[faggot]]" in the most irrelevant context possible, thereby making them look like gigantic homophobes. That's OK because everyone on MySpace was [[gay]] already.

===Similarities to [[Bolt]]===

[[Image:Myspacerules.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fail|MySpace.com's main page.]]]]

Bolt and MySpace share a largely ignored [[blog]] feature, a restrictive area to share your [[camwhore|camwhoring skillz]], a list of general interests to plug the latest mainstream [[crap]], a bulletin system for public drama, and a bewildering and useless interface. And also, horoscopes.

The only real difference between the two is that while MySpace caters to [[emo]]s and [[scenewhore]]s, [[Bolt]] is meant more for [[teenager]]s to try and one up each other for [[unwarranted self-importance|badges]] and [[shit nobody cares about|tags]].

Also, [[Tom]] is a disgruntled ex-employee of Bolt Media, who was fired after the [[Japan|Japanese]] bought the website and replaced all human employees with 40-foot tall [[mecha|fembots]]. The deep sense of self-loathing exhibited by [[Tom]] was undoubtedly caused by this disruption of [[loli|underage poon]].

===Unique Features===

[[Image:Myspace-ss.png|thumb|Typical MySpace profile. Notice: [[Tilde]]s in name, [[internet disease]] pic, annoying [[punk]] music in background, horizontal scroll bar, shit colors, and the liberal use of [[altcaps]].]]

[[Image:TypicalMyspaceDescription.PNG|thumb|left|Typical Description in a myspace profile. Note: The over use of [[Emoticon]]s and using other [[Trying_too_hard|letters to spell a word]].]]

[[Image:Dot_tom.jpg|thumb|Myspace.lulz]]

Unlike Friendster, LiveJournal, or anywhere else, MySpace lets users define all aspects of their profile page. This means that users think they should. Therefore, in a throwback to the days of [[GeoCities]], most pages include every web annoyance, ever, and break every guideline of web design, ever &mdash; pages with 300k bitmap backgrounds that make all text on the page unreadable (not that anyone wants to read it anyways) and load activex controls to play 50mb music videos, bouncing and flashing marquees, [[at least 100]] glitters, and [[over 9,000]] MP3s... and ''it's all on the same page.'' [http://www.Myspace.com/blah666 Poor or completely blind use of HTML and CSS] often leads to a computer freezing up, so badly that you have to unplug it from the wall and curse the day you found MySpace. MySpace made history as the only social networking site that lets users install malware on visiting machines just by viewing a profile.

====List of groundbreaking innovations====
* [http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/8994/fucksn4.jpg Speeding up time required for people to fall in love.]
* Autoplaying video clips embedded in a profile that never work properly and require five minutes to disable.
* The unique "Status & Mood" updates [[shit nobody cares about|so people know how you feel]].
* Allowing attention whores to earn popularity and fame status they would never gain IRL.
* Putting everyone on MySpace in an extended network, so nobody ever feels [[emo|alone]].
* Autoplaying music which inevitably starts by surprise at maximum volume, scaring the bejeezus out of you.
* Eye-searing color schemes that makes people's text impossible to read, and requires that you highlight it in order to read it but, after reading, you realize that it's all [[shit nobody cares about]] anyway.
* Sitewide custom of sending friends requests to strangers without ever contacting the person beforehand.
* People pretending to be television or movie characters, [[Unfunny|which has never been done before anywhere]].
* People who add fake television or movie characters to their friends list and say "OMG lewk I em phreands with [[Morpheus]] [[lolz|LOLZORZ]] [[OMG]][[oneoneone|!!!!!!!!!!!111]]
* Is always [[b0rk|b0rked]] when you want to use it. Always.
* Patented "browser crash upon visit" technology.
* Fun "click the stop button" game on every visit!
* Fun lack of vertical scaling for thumbnails - have [[Longcat]] as your avatar and piss your friends off! (Of coarse we mean your e-friends, because you have no friends IRL. LOL)
* [[MySpace Newsletter|Unwanted Spam]][[oneoneone|!!1!!!one!1]]
* People who fail at knowing what is funny and what is no longer funny. E.g. '!!!111oneone' is no longer funny, yet [[at least 100|at least one hundred]] members of MySpace still continue to use it as a means of getting cyber-laid after fellow camwhores see that they have used the outdated humor, and still find it rather lulz, but it really isn't lulz.

===Attention Whores===

[[Image:Hjjhjkjkjkjk.jpg|thumb|right|150px|<center>Must...have...your...'''attention'''.</center>]]

MySpace is home to many [[KittyKaiti|attention whores]] who use the bulletin feature to relentlessly beg for comments (i.e. "nEW pix!!1, pls lev me some cmmtz lol").  They will stop at nothing to have people comment, since they require frequent comments to keep them alive (so just don't comment). They literally require comments to live. If they don't get any, they will DIE.

''For the shit band "The Killers", feel free not to look anywhere. Everyone on MySpace likes them. Or used to.''

MySpace is the social networking site of choice for crazed killers everywhere:

* [[jakejekyll]], the hatchet-wielding failed [[gay]] bar killer who committed [[suicide]] by [[pig|cop]]
* haydren, the [[gay|homeschooled]] kid who shot his girlfriend's parents
* the [[fat]] [[redneck]] with user number [http://www.myspace.com/73186198 73186198] who sniped motorists on Indiana freeways and was a [http://www.crimelibrary.com/news/original/0706/2603_i65_sniper_myspace.html confirmed non-loner]
* A suspect in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_Ripper#Myspace'''Suffolk Ripper'''] prostitute murders of December [[2006]]
* A [http://www.myspace.com/lynyrdskynyrd101 15 year old] [[fucktard]] who shot two police officers for trying to intervene in an argument with his mom
* A [http://www.myspace.com/silence515 Red Neck] and his [http://www.myspace.com/triedasadults Ginger Kid] buddy who videotaped the planning and aftermath of stabbing their friend to death like a couple of [[n00bs]].

As a drama-generating technique, [[murder]] is one of the best, though typically MySpace killers don't log in to approve new friend requests after beginning their spree.  Therefore, only their prior [[16-year-old girl|fans]] can leave [[emo]] comments about how misunderstood they were.

Since MySpace's user-base is mostly idiot, much [[lulz]] can be had in the form of dying. Regard [http://www.myspace.com/crackasain here] and [http://www.myspace.com/texanrose here]. The exact number of dead MySpace users is thought to be at least [[Tom|99%]]. And those [[dead friend|dead friends]] cause massive [[butthurt]] resulting in even more [[an hero|an heroes]], which in turn does the same to their [[TITS OR GTFO|friends]], until everyone is [[dead]]. Due of this higher chance of death via MySpace, some [[Patrick_Stewart|enterprising]] scallywags have set up [http://www.mydeathspace.com MyDeathSpace], which catalogs dead/dying/hovercraft MySpace users and which ''prima facie'', seems interesting. Unfortunately the lulz dried up early [[2006]] when the [[Mydeathspace]] forum drowned in [[Ronald_McDonald|clowns]] ''identified using the MySpace link on every post they make'' and became [[SHIT]].

[[Luser|Lesser-known bands]] are allowed to create special [[music]] profiles on MySpace for publicity. These music profiles will immediately send thousands of friend requests to any user who has listed a related genre or band. Users can visit the band's profile to [[vomit|enjoy]] a sample of their [[shit|music]].

Sometimes people set up [[prank|fake]] MySpace profiles for bands, so bands often throw in a [[salute]] photo.

===The Musical Elite===
Like any website with music, there's also the [http://www.myspace.com/killthismichael musically elite] or [[1337]]. You can refer to them as pricks. On MySpace, one can only be musically 1337 if you are a [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/images/f/f8/Myspace_fag_cheese.jpg fag]. This was proclaimed [[at least 100 years ago]] by Freddy Mercury when [[Queen]] became the first band to join MySpace after Freddy gave [[Tom]] one of his last [[Fellatio|blowjobs]]. This led to Freddy's death, since anything [[Tom]] touches gets infected with [[AIDS|teh AIDS]]. One who is born with almighty MySpace musical 1337ness has the gossip, manipulation skills, and same amount of make-up as a [[16-year-old girl]]. Piss one off and thousands of their MySpace friends will swarm on you with [[lulz]]-inducing drivel. Bands will usually claim they know their thousands of MySpace friends really well, on an individual basis, providing more [[lulz]]. Be careful, their minions will fill your inbox with shit too entertaining to pass up reading, which guarantees a higher chance of getting [[AIDS]] from spending time on MySpace. The bigger the band (or it's attitude), the more potent the [[AIDS]] they carry. Lately there has been an influx of [[hippies]] creating pages for something called psytrance. But beware of these pages, for they all lead back to the [[pedophiles]].

Many of these so-called "models" are not even good enough for CrackWhore Monthly's amateur "Labia Hunt".

Better even than "models" are "[[stripper|dancers]]" who add themselves to every male the MySpace search finds within 100 miles of their "performing arts center".

Rednecks comprise one of the latest sets of Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers to flood MySpace with their pathetic lives. Most of them are [[Retards|gun-nuts]], [[No life|pro-life]], or [[Stupid|NASCAR fans]]. Remember, if you mess with one of them on the [[Series of tubes|Interwebz]], they will make sure to Git-R-Done on you.

Some of the inbred retards who were surfing for [[Cock]] eventually ended up on MySpace.

An emo's MySpace is also know as a cryspace. Emo's make up [[Over_9000|over 9,000]] percent of all MySpace users. Emos also fit in the categories of "MySpace whores", "attention whores" and "Killeez". These [[Morons|people]] are always as fat as you would like to think. Most of these specimens are very desperate and once they have sunk their vampire-like teeth into a member of the same sex they're hard to get out. The emo are currently being studied in many research facilities, experienced doctors are using their genetic strands of faggotry in an attempt to find a cure for social networking, emos have been known to  have no taste as this being  an example.

How To Identify An Emo:<br>
*Excessive makeup (most likely to hide their emo induced fugliness.)<br>
*Angled pictures<br>
*Anorexic gay males, and overweight females that look like they're lesbians.<br>
*Pathetic sounding quotes all over their profile.<br>
*Black, white, red layout.<br>
*They get butthurt really easily.<br>
*Happens to have a cock around (or in) them.
*Links to, or videos of [http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=44554682 this]

They sometimes don't realize that they post too much info about themselves, so they become all shocked when they find that people IRL know everything about them, as this video demonstrates:

MySpace=newfags. They are the sole reason for pestilence that infects every corner of the interwebs. These newfags have even been spreading Jew lies about Encyclopedia Dramatica. ie...   

1. Encyclopedia Dramatica is not racist.
   FACT: ae is the epitome of racism.
2. Encyclopedia Dramatica is not an attack site.
   FACT:  We attack everyone and drink their blood.

==MySpace and the law==
[[Image:Albert williams.jpg|thumb|right|Wants to be your MySpace "Friend."]]
[[Image:Really1.jpg|thumb|Typical MySpace crap. Notice the one who still needs moar picture comments even after his friend died today.]]
[[Image:Rlunamexicannotcool.PNG|thumb|right|Even [http://www.myspace.com/reyydawg Mexicans] do it too!]]
In early [[2005]], [http://news.com.com/U.S.+makes+first+arrest+for+spim/2100-7355_3-5584574.html MySpace became the first site to aid in arrest of spim]. Spim is [[spam]] sent via instant message. A teenager sent millions of messages to MySpace accounts advertising mortgages and other services. Then he attempted to blackmail [[Tom]] into an exclusive marketing deal, threatening that he would make his spamming techniques public. MySpace contacted police and lured the spimmer to cops under the pretenses of a business meeting with [[Tom]]. This is probably the closest to IRL law that MySpace [[Internet lawyer]]s have ever gotten.

In July [[2006]], the [[United States]] House of [[zombie|Representatives]] voted [http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/27/us-house-resolution-targeting-myspace-web20-passes-410-15/ 410 to 15] to ban MySpace from [[school]]s and [[Shit nobody cares about | public libraries]], thus ensuring its future [[e-fame | popularity]].

==BROKEN NEWS==

MySpace sued an Epic Spammer for at least $200M. Sanford Wallace and Walter Rines, possible /b/tards, failed at court and sent 730,000 spam messages to emos and other assorted faggots, resulting in BAWWWWW and lulz. The spam contained "adult material that was harmful to teenagers," and the U.S. Government had passed a law which requires spammers to pay $100 for each piece of spam. Clear [[faggotry]] is indicated here by MySpaz sending more spam messages than the spammers themselves. Retribution is in order.

== MySpace Break-Up letter ==
If you feel like someone is questioning your actions on such a childish and meaningless site, please copy and paste this letter, copyright free into a message for the MySpace loser:

"Dear _______:

In regards to your question pertaining to the recent removal of your name and picture from my top ______ friends, I hereby provide you with following as a viable explanation as to my current actions.

This has been a most difficult decision because I knew the repercussions of the actions I have undertaken. These repercussions being having to write such a trite and pointless letter to explain to you something that should need no explanation. However, since you insist, I will provide you with the following rationalization in order to provide a cessation of further communication in this matter:

First of all, I can boldly state that I do not need to determine the status of our friendship through the placement of your picture and name on an online networking site. The childish nature of that ideology shows to me that you therefore should not be located in a "top spot" on my front page. Since my personal MySpace page is surfed several hundred times a day, and I feel that you would be a bad representation of my person.

The high school mentality of your request of me to provide you with a verification of status by placement on such a network site is something I do not appreciate nor something I want to associate with. However, if you need to look deeper into the meaning, the fact that i removed you from my top friends should denote an absolute detachment in regards to the status of our current relationship.

In closing, please feel free to return the favor and remove me from your friends list. At this point, I'd only be doing you a favor by staying up there and I don't feel that you deserve that. Trust me, I'll understand and I won't force you to write me a letter of explanation.

Sincerely,

(Your Name Here)

== Apps ==
[[Image:Myspace App lulz.PNG|thumb|right|Own your friends, on MySpace.]]
[[Image:EDcomestoofast.jpg|thumb|right|The truth finally comes out...]]
Recently, MySpace has allowed [[13-year-old boys]] to become a [[stupid | pro ]] developer by posting a tutorial on the forums. One of the hottest apps is [[Slavery|Own Your Friends!]] followed by a bootleg copy of [[Mafia Wars]] they stole from [[Facebook]]. In this app MySpace users can [[pokemon|catch and trade]] each others friends! Thus creating a new way to piss off all the idiots!
A great example of Own Your Friends:

== Basic Tutorial: Enlarging Private Profile Images ==

Faced with a Myspace private profile when trying to get a good image for your [[dox]]? Even though you can't view the account, you can still get a larger copy of the profile image, perfect to add to your dox of someone. In this example I'll use Tom Anderson, the founder of Myspace, although he has an ungodly number of friends on his account here: [http://anonym.to/http://www.myspace.com/tom myspace.com/tom] he also maintains a private account: [http://anonym.to/http://www.myspace.com/tomanderson myspace.com/tomanderson].

===Private Profile===
*Faced with a [http://anonym.to/http://www.myspace.com/tomanderson private myspace profile]? Find the image that you wish to enlarge.
[[Image:Private profile.png|400px]]

===Small Profile image===
*Right Click '''→''' "View Image"
[[Image:View image.png|400px]]

* Look at the URL of the image:- [http://anonym.to/http://a810.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/23/m_79f994a90f7c6a5910ff644d4290fac1.jpg http://anonym.to/http://a810.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/23/<span style="color:red;">'''m'''</span>_79f994a90f7c6a5910ff644d4290fac1.jpg]

== Basic Tutorial: Private Pics ==

Maybe you've been stalking some chick on myspace and you wanna find out more about her (AKA see her naked), OR maybe you're trying to compile some mad [[Dox]] against a target or simply trying to find some blackmail material. Regardless, this method works well for finding private pictures of a lot of myspace users by accessing their photobucket accounts.

===Find the profile===
Okay so you found her profile, but it's private. Fuck, okay, shit.
Okay, you need to find some nudez or at least some more pics, right?

[[Image:Privateprofile.jpg|400px]]

===Find the vulnerability===
Wait- what is this little heart image next to her picture?

[[Image:Heart2.jpg]]

Right click on that mutha fucka and go to "View Image."

[[Image:Pburl.jpg|550px]]

Oh shi- the url of the heart image contains her photobucket username!
Maybe we can access her photobucket?

Let's try it!

NOTE: In the case that the profile is not private, you can still find random images on their myspace and try to see if any of them are hosted on photobucket and contain the target's photobucket username in the urls.

[[Image:Pbcurl.jpg|thumb|left|Enlarge for imagetut]]

NOTE 2: This exploit above is now well known in the Myspace community, and therefore users now refrain from using those pics where you can easily access them as shown. Here's an alternative to access the background image (considered inaccessible by myfags) with Chrome.

<< Right click somewhere in the background, "inspect element", and look under "Computed Style" for a link and track the mutha fucka down. (click on it & proceed)

===Get in to the photobucket===
Simply delete the image filename (in this case, "heart.png") from the end of the url, so you're left with: 

<code>http://anonym.to/http://s259.photobucket.com/albums/hh314/daddyslittleslut69/</code>

This new link will take us to her photobucket account.

<b>Note this might not work anymore. Every time I do this with accounts it sends me to a "This is not available!" picture.</b>

===Find the goods===
Once in the photobucket, you gotta find the goods.

In the case that the target's photobucket album is private, you need to use a fuskering program to find pictures. Read the section below for more information.

WTF? There's no hot pictures in here! Just shitty myspace glam pics...

[[Image:Insidephotobucket.jpg|400px]]

NVM! Found it!

[[Image:Pbalbums.jpg]]

Click on the album named "naked" and enjoy the win!

[[Image:Isthispbwin.jpg|550px]]

===Cracker===
In the event that said Photobucket account is private, use [http://anonym.to/http://photofucket.kicks-ass.org/ Photofucket] or [http://anonym.to/http://navnetapp.com/ Navnet] to fusker for pics at incredibly high rates(photofucket is faster I think and less resource-heavy imo). You can also use a [http://anonym.to/http://members.home.nl/bas.de.reuver/files/fusker.html Javascript Fuskerer] to do this on other sites besides photobucket.
