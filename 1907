Curps
'''Curps''' is a [[robot]]ic automaton on [[Wikipedia]]. While he was once human, Curps slowly degenerated into an android-like creature with a likeness of Commander Data on [[Star Trek]] or Robocop. Now, nobody's really sure if there is any remnant of humanity in his cold, machine [[â™¥|heart]]. 

However, unlike Data or Robocop, Curps does not patrol the streets of a decaying [[Detroit]] or serve aboard the Starship Enterprise. Instead, he leads an ignoble life [[Ban|blocking]] [[people]] from Wikipedia. 

His complex blocking system is based on the following criteria;

#Jimbo and Company dislike [[you]].
#A [[random]] word, letter, or character is present in your user name. 
#His instinctive need as a robot to dispassionately inflict pain on human beings.

Regarding his dual [[cyborg]] nature, Curps had [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=47773382 this] to say:
{{Quote|I don't know why you are anthropomorphizing the bot, as if it was thinking [[evil]] [[cyber]]netic thoughts (I'm sorry, [[SPUI]], I can't open the pod bay doors).|[[Wikipedia:en:User:Curps|Curps]] 08:19, 10 April 2006 (UTC)}} 

In summer [[2006]], Curps [[Wikicide|disappeared]] from TOW, never to be seen again. Recently it was rumored that the thing that once was Curps had the [[Death|plug pulled]] on it, literally, because he was a robot. However, even more recent rumors have it that he is going by another name on [[TOW]]: [[Wikipedia:User:Misza13|Misza13]].
