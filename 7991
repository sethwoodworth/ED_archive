TSA
The '''Transportation Security Agency''' (AKA Tasty Sexual Assault, Touchy Scrotum Assessment, or  Twisted Sack Assist.) is a government organization under the command of [[KGB|The Committee for State Security]]. Because it is an agency which adheres to the [[patriot act]] as its bible, its sole purpose is to hand out strip searches and [[anal|cavity exams]] at airports across the country in hopes of catching potential [[terrorist|delicious loli]]s. In an unusual attempt to actually keep the public "informed" of their actions, the TSA has set up a [[blog]] on its website so that freedom loving [[Americans]] everywhere can let off steam while at the same time be ignored. However, in predictable government fashion, they somehow manage to fuck everything up and tend to come off as either completely ridiculous or subjective to the point of absurdity.  So if [http://www.tsa.gov/blog/2009/10/grenades-refresher-course-on-checkpoint.html Grenades: A Refresher Course on Checkpoint Etiquette] sounds interesting to you, head on over and be entertained while the [[government]] records your IP address and <S>begins</s> continues to monitor your online activities.

You probably just got placed on the terrorist watch list just for reading this article.

==TSA Success Stories==
In 2010 the TSA began ramping up the use of Advanced Imaging Technology to scan passengers as they attempted to board their flights. Since many objected to government rent-a-cops seeing them naked, passengers are given the ability to "opt out" of these scans. People who choose to "opt out" of the [[cancer|radiation bath]] are generously offered the alternative search method: getting [[fisted|frisked]] by a TSA agent. As [[cell phone]]s and [[internets]] enter the equation, [[lulz]] were sure to ensue.

===The Tyner Incident===
John Tyner was boarding a flight with his father-in-law as they headed out of [[San Diego]] on a hunting trip. San Diego is a well known breeding ground for caucasian terrorists, so of course John was selected for the [[oven|AIT scan]]. After responding "[[lol]], [[no]]", he was directed to the VIP rape room. Hitting "record" on his cell phone later proved to be a big hit on [[YouTube]].

{{quote|By buying your ticket you gave up a lot of rights.|TSA Supervisor}}

The TSA is now saying they're going to "[[rape|investigate]]" Tyner and possibly fine him $11,000. 

The [[tl;dr]] version:

===3 Year Old Terrorist Foiled===
The TSA has recently ruined another terrorist plot. This one was disguised as a young Thomas the Tank Engine fan. Luckily for us, after [[CP|examining his penis]] they nabbed him and his backpack, thwarting the next [[9/11]]. [[Image:Tsapedobear.jpg|thumb|right|The TSA's new [[Pedobear|mascot.]]]]

===TSA : your number 1 source for wheelchair porn===
52 years old Tammy Banovac was exposed for hours in lingerie by [[Lemonparty|TSA wheelchair fetishists]] angry she wouldn't allow them to cavity-search her. "Why she would complain is beyond us, as she can't even feel down there", some allegedly raged.

==Janet Napolitano==

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who is also exempt from these searches, says terrorists will continue to look for U.S. vulnerabilities, making tighter security standards necessary.

“Terrorists are going to continue to probe the system and try to find a way through. I think the tighter we get on aviation, we have to also be thinking now about going on to mass transit or to trains or maritime. So, what do we need to be doing to strengthen our protections there?”

The secretary has adamantly defended the new screening methods, which include advanced imaging systems and pat-downs, as necessary to ineffectively stopping terrorists and filling the coffers of those selling such equipment. During the interview with Rose, Napolitano said her agency is now looking into ways to make other popular means of travel more invasive of the people's rights, more of a hassle for commuters, and more profitable for corporations.

===The TSA and [[You]]===
While traveling the friendly skies please remember that you're not just being ogled and groped for no reason, you're being ogled and groped to keep America safe. After all, this is way better than just profiling [[muslims]]. And when the terrorists learn to avoid detection by [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=keister&defid=817022 keistering their C4], Uncle Sam will be there, ready and waiting to [[goatse|prolapse your rectum]]. After all, why do you think TSA workers sign up for the job? The pay?

==Naked Body Scanners and Grope Searches==
[[File:TSA_Fish.jpg|thumb|right|And by fish, he means pants; by water, he means penis.]]
[[File:Tsa_worker.jpg|thumb|right|Typical TSA employee, hard at work.]]
TSA says [[Tits]] or [[GTFO]]! If it wasn't bad enough that the government was staging all the terror, making sure all the terrorists got to their destinations, now it's in your pants. They want to take pictures of you naked and store these images on the machine. This means that everyone who goes through the machine has his picture stored in the machine. Men, women and children are equally subject to this kind of scan. This violates child pornography laws as well as the personal instinct of right and wrong. There is also the exposure to radiation, which is many times that of an x-ray at the doctor. If you go to have an x-ray done, they use shielding made of lead to protect your body from the unnecessary exposure. Radiation even in the doses used is considered too dangerous for you to not be protected. The doctor leaves the room, which highlights the dangers involved at even low levels of radiation used for diagnostic reasons. The naked body scanner, which gives off radiation merely by being on, is also a harm for the operators, but nobody cares about them.  Other places there are used are in courthouses and random trucks driving on the highway will nude-scan you too. [http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=202853]

Result: BUSTED


==What if I refuse?==
[[Image:TSA.NutsAboutSecurity.jpg|thumb|At the TSA, we're nuts about security, we know it takes a special touch to keep [[America]] safe and we need your help. We have internship [[Goatse|openings]] available so you can get a feel for what it's like to wear the hat and gloves.]]
The TSA worker will then scream so everyone can hear "OPT OUT! OPT OUT! WE HAVE AN OPT OUT!" to humiliate you and make it obvious that you are refusing the scan. You will then be groped and felt all over your body by a man if you are a man or a woman if you are a woman. You can also be subject to having them search you by sticking their hand down your pants to their wrist. You are then felt down and patted on the front and back, often in public. If they ask to take you to a private place, REFUSE CALMLY, BUT BE FIRM. These people WILL rape you at the first opportunity. They are control freaks who are in this job field because they couldn't get a job at [[McDonald's]]. This is what they want to do; humiliate and violate. Some of the TSA agents are not bad/wicked/horrible people, but this is a minority in the TSA. Just kidding they are all pedophile rapists.  And don't forget, the TSA don't change their gloves so you are guaranteed to get STDs from the groping.[http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=232457]

==John S. Pistole==

John S. Pistole is the great chairman of the [[TSA]] and absolutely loves his job at the TSA. Molesting and humiliating people without being in the same [[Rape|Room]]. While he sits in his great golden throne while being worshiped by absolute fucking [[Morons]], he likes to scream at the top of his lungs that he is the almighty [[god]]. The great employees at TSA don't even know who he is, but they are too busy looking at your penis in a [[Cancer|Radiation Bath]].

==National opt out day==

National opt out day was for a more organized protest of this legalized TSA rape of adults and children. The media all reported it fizzled and was much ado about nothing. However the articles state that TSA did turn OFF all of the machines on that day in anticipation of this protest. This clearly defeats the point that the cancer machines were oh so vital to national security. The joke was on TSA as it was reported that not many people flew that day. It was the most subtle protest in history and TSA missed the whole thing. Perhaps they were too busy making a young mother miss her flight as she had a great rack or putting on their required pedo bear outfits for the children. 

A lot of people are still protesting in full swing and there are reports and youtubes of people showing up at the airports already in their underwear or wearing a bathing suit.

==Children's Toys==
[[File:Playmobil Security Check Point.jpg|frame|right|The Toy]]
[http://www.amazon.com/Playmobil-3172-Security-Check-Point/dp/B0002CYTL2/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top Playmobil Security Check Point.] Reviews from Buyers:

{{quote3|I was a little disappointed when I first bought this item, because the functionality is limited. My 5 year old son pointed out that the passenger's shoes cannot be removed. Then, we placed a deadly fingernail file underneath the passenger's scarf, and neither the detector doorway nor the security wand picked it up. My son said "that's the worst security ever!". But it turned out to be okay, because when the passenger got on the Playmobil B757 and tried to hijack it, she was mobbed by a couple of other heroic passengers, who only sustained minor injuries in the scuffle, which were treated at the Playmobil Hospital.

The best thing about this product is that it teaches kids about the realities of living in a high-surveillence society. My son said he wants the Playmobil Neighborhood Surveillence System set for Christmas. I've heard that the CC TV cameras on that thing are pretty worthless in terms of quality and motion detection, so I think I'll get him the Playmobil Abu-Gharib Interogation Set instead (it comes with a cute little memo from George Bush).}}

{{quote3|This toy would be a lot more realistic with about 350 people standing in line for an average of an hour. It still makes a nice set with the interrogation room.}}

{{quote3|My family was planning a vacation to Europe, so I purchased this item to teach my twins about what to expect at the airport and hopefully, alleviate some of their anxiety. We also downloaded the actual TSA security checklist from the American Airlines website and then proceeded with our demonstration. Well, first we had to round up a Barbie and a few Bratz dolls to play the other family members, so that cost us a few extra bucks at the Dollar General and it is aggravating that the manufacturer did not make this product "family-friendly." Of course, since the playmobil Dad could not remove his shoes or other clothing items, unlike the Barbie, the playmobil security agent became suspicious and after waving her wand wildy a few dozen times, called her supervisor to wisk the Dad into a special body-cavity search room, (which incidentally led to quite an embarasing and interesting discussion with my twin daughters about personal hygiene and a slight adjustment to the rules we had them memorize about touching by strangers). But worst of all, since the suitcase did not actually open, the baggage inspector made a call to the FBI and ATF bomb squads which then segregated the family's suitcase (which btw was the only suitcase they provided for our educational family experience) and according to the advanced TSA regulations, had to blow it up, (since they could not otherwise mutilate the luggage, break off the locks and put one of those nice little advisory stickers on it), which we had to simulate out in the backyard with a few M-80s and other fireworks. The girls started crying. They became so hysterical by the whole experience that we could not even get them in the car when the time came to actually take our trip, and so we had to cancel the whole thing at the last minute, losing over $7,000 in airfare and hotel charges that we could not recoup do to the last minute cancellations. We've now spent an additional $3,000 to pay for the girls therapy and medication over the past year since this incident occurred, and the psychologists have told us that this will affect them for life, so much for their college fund and our retirement. Then, to top it all off, when we tried to use to playmobil phone to call the company to ask for reimbursement, as you might expect, of course the damn thing didn't even work; neither did our efforts to e-mail them using the computer screen on the baggage checkpoint; and our real-life efforts to contact them to obtain re-imbursement have also likewise been ignored. Worse yet, we had the product tested and found out that it was positive for both lead paint and toxic chemicals, having been manufactured in China by workers holding formerly American jobs, so now we all have cancer and have been given only another year or so to live. My advice - educating your kids about airport security with this toy may actually be more harmful to them than just packing them in the damn luggage with some bottled water & hoping they survive. :)}}
