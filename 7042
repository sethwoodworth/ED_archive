'''Esmie''' (aka {{lj|user=rockonlittleone}}) is just your average [[16-year-old girl|16-year-old]] [[azn]] [[girl]]. She's well known and loved on [[Xanga]], [[Livejournal]], [[MySpace]], and even [[IRL]]. Many of her friends and neighbors describe her as ''"intellectually gifted"'' a ''"cool kid"'', and an all round ''"nice little girl"''. Her pastimes include playing piano, debating for her school, and stabbing her mother to death.


==The Murder==
I have no idea what happened on that night, I've never even met anyone from Kansas. Here's what I like to think happened. Esmie was a wonderful debater. She would [[fuck|debate]] for hours at school, and she probably picked up the skill from her [[your mom|mother]], another [[masturbation |master debater]]. What Esmie's mother didn't realize was that words aren't as persuasive as combat knives. Like any rebellious [[16 year old girl]], Esmie hated doing the dishes with a passion. So you can imagine the look on her face when Mrs. Tseng asked her to do the dishes on the night in question. Esmie was pissed. She started screaming [[attention whore|"OMFG YOU DUMB CUNT!!! I'M NEVER DOING THE DISHES AGAIN!!! CATCH; YOU SELFISH WHORE!!!"]] Esmie proceeded to throw a combat knife at her mother, who caught it, but in her chest.

==After the Kirrings==
Since the incident, her [[friends]] have done everything in their power to show they care, including:
*[http://members.shaw.ca/kouji/esmie/ Leaving her Xanga comments.]
*[[Deleting your LiveJournal|Deleting her LiveJournal and Xanga]].
*Saying "[[Fuck]]" and using [[All caps|the capslock key]] a lot.

She also tries to communicate through a friend of hers by mailing letters from jail... to be posted on her journal. Not even a killer can resist being away from LJ too long.  She also has [http://www.esmie.com gathered all her ePals] to rally behind her to have her tried as a minor and keep her ass out of prison on a life sentence. Matricide is [[serious business]].
