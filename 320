'''Alan [[Cox]]''' is an archetypal [[nerd]]: he is a [[computer]] programmer, a [[role-playing|roleplayer]] and a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Communist]] who believes that patent and [[copyright]] laws are evil. He helped develop something called "[[Linux]]" and also set up one of the first [[MUD]]s. As if that wasn't nerdish enough, Alan maintains a [[weblog]] written [http://zenii.linux.org.uk/diary/ entirely in Welsh]. He has been quoted as saying, "Linux Torvalds is wonderful developer, but a lousy [[engineer]]".

He currently is Czar of the [[socialist]] republic of "Whales" (allegedly it is an island near [[England]]) and works for the [[Red Hat]].
