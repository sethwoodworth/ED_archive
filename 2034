==[[Scientologist]] Relatives==
Much more interesting than Danny are his nephew Bodhi and in-law, Jenna:
*They are part of the "Scientologists hate psychiatrists for diagnosing them as nuts" campaign [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Elfman#Scientology-related_activities].
*In February [[2006]], Jenna [[Whore|donated an hour of her time to be auctioned off to the highest bidder]] on [[eBay]] as part of the "Fuck A Fruitcake" fundraiser
*In the ABC sitcom ''Dharma and Greg'', Jenna was typecast as a "ditzy" character - hardly a stretch.
*Jenna invented the Cumtini, and foretells the future using splashes from her colonic irrigation sessions.
