Deflamation
{{elaw}} 
'''Deflamation''' is an [[internet]] [[meme]] made known when a [[Canadian]] named [[Cyndre]] threatened to sue people over "Deflamation". Yes, we were confused too.

:06:49 < Cyndre> because I feel that its deflamatory towards my person and having                a picture of me that I didnt post is privacy invasion, because we                 never posted that picture on the net
 
:06:53 < Cyndre> I agree with you tfo, but when stolen pictures and real names are                 used its not funny any more
 
:07:27 < Cyndre> I tried to talk.  Thanks for deflaming me, my website, and posting                 a picture you have no right to even possess.
