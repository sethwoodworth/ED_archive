'''Hyves''' (aka [[AIDS|HIVs]] aka The Dutch Facebook) is the brainchild of a guy named [[Geert Wilders]].  Geert [[you don't have any friends|didn't have much friends]], so he thought to himself "Why shouldn't I make my own Facebook?".

Two things make HIVs noteworthy:

*Instead of a "Like" button, it has a "Respect" button. This makes the usual arms race for attention common to all social networking sites that little bit more amusing and creepy.
* Hyves has like 8 million users, and there are only 17 million dutch. This means that 45% of all Dutch people are attention whores.
