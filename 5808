Nobody Cares

'''Nobody cares''' is a *[[chan]] game beloved of the heartless unforgiving, unforgetting [[Anon]]s of /[[b]]/. It plays out like this:

==The Maths==
[[Original_Poster|OP]] posts his whiny, gay problem or proud accomplishment on /b/ hoping for some advice, back-patting or any kind of positive [[buttsecks|input]] from the [[retards|rocket scientist]]s of [[4chan]]. This is done by [[newfags]] who never noticed the [[/adv/]] board.

==The Result==

===ITT:OP is a Hat Making Faggot===
[[Image:Essence_of_b.jpg|frame|center|OP got [[pwnt]].]]

===ITT:OP [[BAW|BAWWWWS]]===
[[Image:Nobody_cares.png|frame|center|The [[peanut gallery]] ignores OP completely and goes on to discuss something else entirely, leaving OP with his dick in a [[glory hole]] with [[noone]] on the other side.]]

==Twists==
Frequently, OP will post his whiny, gay [[rape|problem]] with an unrelated pic (and the classic [[troll]] bait: "[[pic unrelated]]" after the [[copypasta|preamble]]) at which point, the subsequent posters in the [[thread]] will ignore whatever OP is bitching/bragging about and start discussing the unrelated picture (or something in it). Funniest shit ever.

==OP is a Faggot==
Many simply don't like to be reminded of the faggotry that has been swirling around /b/. The fight between [[moralfags]] and [[trolls|hatefags]] has reached the point where even the adolescent sociopaths of [[4chan]] [[do not want]] to speak of it.
