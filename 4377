John Holmes

'''John C. Holmes''' was born August 8, 1944 and went on to become one of the greatest [[drug]]-addicted [[gay|bi-sexual]] detectives and [[whore|adult film stars]] of the twentieth century. He appeared in over 2,000 [[fap|porno flicks]] (''including some blatant film [[faggotry]] thrown in for good measure'') while [[police|solving crimes]] with the help of his loyal [[penis]], which he lovingly called “Doctor Watson.” Holmes died of [[fail]] and [[AIDS]] on March 13, 1988, after solving his last big mystery, the Cryptic Case of the Wonderland [[Murder]]s.

The [[cocaine|coke]] sniffing Holmes and Watson had many adventures and got into many [[cum|sticky situations]] throughout their long and industrious career. It was said that the two would often argue about who was the bigger star, but it was generally accepted that Holmes would have been nothing without Watson. This was later proven to be true when, after Holmes died, Watson went on to have an enduring career on British television when he scored the roll of Monty Hall’s sidekick on the hit BBC game show “'''Beat The [[Cock]]'''.” It was much later that Watson gained his biggest fame, standing in as [[goatse|John Kerry]]’s penis during the 2004 Presidential Election.

==The Wonderland Murders==

Holmes' and Watson’s drug use began to negatively effect their ability to [[fap|solve crimes]] and [[stick it in her pooper|perform in porn]], so in-between cases they started whoring themselves out to both [[gay|men]] and [[fat|women]]. The crime-fighting team then developed a friendship with a piece of [[tubgirl|shit]] drug dealer named Eddie Nash, who supplied Holmes and Watson with the coke they so adored. At the same time, Holmes and Watson were closely watching the Wonderland Gang, so-called for the location of their hideout; a rowhouse located on Wonderland Avenue in a neighborhood in Los Angeles. Unknown to the pair of detectives, the Wonderland Gang had followed them to Eddie Nash’s house, where they stole all that delicious cocaine.

Thoroughly pissed off, Nash showed the Wonderland Gang that he was [[Ripper|hard core]]. Two days after being ripped off, four out of five of the Wonderland gang were found beaten to death with a claw hammer in their blood-spattered hideout, and became known as '''The Case of the Wonderland Murders'''. Holmes and Watson followed a tricky trail of clues, which led them straight back to Eddie Nash. Holmes then [[pwned]] Nash by beating him mercilessly with Doctor Watson, after which Holmes promptly died of AIDS. Watson survived, and was unhurt other than a minor concussion and some bruises to the [[cock|helmet]]. Eddie Nash survived his pummeling and went on to form the hit musical group “'''Crosby, Stills and Nash'''.”
