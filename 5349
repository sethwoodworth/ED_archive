Michael Berry
[[File:Mike berry 2.jpg|thumb|He even looks like a [[Nazi]].]]
On September 8, 2010, reich wing advocate and pundit '''Michael Berry''' filled in for political psycho [[Mark Levin]] on the neocon's political talk show.  While replacing Levin, Michael Berry felt the need to go on a 15 minute poison filled rant that liberally dripped with hate speech and racism. America, fed up with spics, muslims, and niggers, ate up the radio performance with a fervor best described as fanatical fascism. 

What makes it even better is that Levin and Berry both boast that the [[Youtube]] clip has millions of views, but at this writing, it appears that the clip only has a few thousand.  That's okay though, typical [[Republicans]] will just say this is yet another example of the vast media conspiracy perpetrated by the Left.

This is not the first time that Michael Berry has caused the world to gnash its collective teeth and feel incensed at his brutality.  In the past, Berry has called for the [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7025777.html bombing of peaceful mosques] and has stirred up trouble with his [http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&id=7466366 belligerent rhetoric].  

With politicos such as Berry tossing around such bile, is it any wonder that calm, peace loving Americans wish to reinstate the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine Fairness Doctrine] so that we can finally silence this nutjob?  Clearly, the founding fathers did not have people like Mike Berry in mind when they drew up the Constitution and the [[First Amendment]].
