Saddie Julian
[[last thursday]] [[jailbait|Saddie Julian]] has been [[lie|kidnapped]] by 27 year old [[basement dweller|Morgan Jones]] after meeting up at Boise. Saddie Julian was taken to a tent in Palouse Falls State Park and was found by a citizen.

==What the Police said happened==
Saddie Julian and Morgan Jones were two [[nerd|World of Warcraft players]] who went on a [[fail|raid]] together and developed an [[lol wut|e-relationship]]. After a few [[cybersex|chats]] [[virgin|Morgan Jones]] decided to come all the way from Alabama to Boise (looks like someone is really desperate to fuck a [[jailbait]]), where he will [[rape|meet]] her and later kidnap her and take her to a fucking tent. [[fail]]

==What actually happened==
Seeing as Saddie Julian and Morgan Jones both were into the game World of Warcraft, it is believed that Morgan Jones tricked Saddie (I think the name is good, she is a sad girl for playing WoW) that he will drive his car and take her on a dungeon raid at [[buttsecks|Dark Temple]]. And being a loyal and nerdy WoW player, Saddie agreed and so rode Morgan's [[fail|epic]] [[penis|mount]], [[amirite]]??
It is also said that Saddie rode Morgan's [[fail|epic]] mount because Morgan has a [[tl;dr|lvl 80 Warlock with a T9 gear that has been enchanted and gives 123 stamina, 123 sprit and 2 EPIC MOUNTS]]!!! [[fail|WIN WIN WIN]]!!! 
Somewhere in a dark room corner [[pedobear]] is luring little nerdy WoW playing girls the same way...

==OMGROFL==
How can a guy who is so [[fail|pro]] at WoW and can [[rape|hook up]] girls like Saddie get caught?! It's because he is [[doing it wrong]].
[[image:chevy.jpg|thumb|right|If you own a car like this, you can also pick up [[jailbait|Saddie]]]]
How he is [[doing it wrong]]:
*He owns a 2008 yellow chevy (only [[faggots]] and [[fucktards]] buy that color of chevy)
*His liscense plate reads: [[true|OMGROFL]]. He is [[retard|asking for attention]]. 
*He took her to a fucking tent and parked his car [[fail|where it can be seen]].

So if [[you]] are planning on taking a [[jailbait|girl]] on a [[rape|trip]] you really should consider how you are going to hide.
