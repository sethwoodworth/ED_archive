'''www.thisaintnews.com''', often refered to as TAN,  is an internets based website that allows [[nerds|internet cadets]] from across the civilised world to scroll through a number of [[shit nobody cares about|news articles, pictures, movies, internet links and user created blogs]]. The most unique and alluring quality of TAN is that it’s obviously a blatant rip-off of: Digg, reddit and [[shoutwire|shoutwire.com]]. 
==History==
thisaintnews.com was created roughly three months ago from [[thursday|today]]. It’s [[boring|controversial]] conception held no punches as former [[shoutwire]] user MrBig4545 dropped his [[e-fame|hit new internet single]] as an answer to shoutwire's evident corruption. This resulted in a very heated internet [[faggotry|flame war]] between the two [[losers|warring factions]] representing each site. Roughly four hours into the flame war everyone suddenly realized how pointless they're lives were and went their separate ways. From this point on the website’s user base grew and grew where it remains to be one of the least popular spots on the internet to this day. 
===Site Creator===

MrBig4545, the creator and operator of TAN, is an [[IRC]]/[[windows|linux]] [[nerd]] turned [[1337|pro]]. Seeing an blog challenge on the internet to create the worst social news networking site in the world, MrBig answered by designing a totally genuine, news-entertainment based website concept from the ground up.

==Site Features==
Thisaintnews.com boasts a plethora of features,  numbering about two in all. 
*Unlike the comments sections on most websites, TAN allows the user to completely edit his or her comment space. Changing the font, size color and giving them the ability to insert images or movies. This proves especially useful for the large ammount of pedophiles who frequent the website.
*User created blogs containing no relevant or entertaining material are allowed to hit the website’s main page.
