Poser

Theoretically, a '''poser''' is a person who acts like they are an expert in a given field, while nothing could be further from the [[truth]].

In reality, however, the word "poser" means ''"everyone except me".'' Yes, whatever you're into, from [[the Beatles]] to medieval antique [[butt plug]]s, you can always be pretty certain that you know a lot more about it than anyone. Everyone else who claims to be into it is just posturing, and their meager experience with it is dwarfed by your own [[God]]-like wisdom. After all, you liked butt-plugs before they were cool, and that's all that matters. A poser can also refer to someone who attempts at using a stereotype to create a self-image that truthfully does not portray who they really are.

A poser may also be infected with a [[Unwarranted self-importance|particularly nasty virus]].

This attitude is especially common among [[16-year-old girl]]s, and can be observed in just about every [[lifestyle]] and subculture in existence, particularly the following:
* [[Ana]]s
* [[Bisexual]]s
* [[Cutters]]
* [[Elitist musical bastards]]
* [[Vampires]]

==Alternate spelling==
[[Canadians | Faggots]] spell it ''poseur'', under the false impression that this makes them seem more [[Europe]]an, which in turn makes them more edgy. Ironically, most people who spell it this way tend to be posers themselves.

Either way works, it all depends on how gay you are.
