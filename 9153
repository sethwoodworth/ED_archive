Worst picture ever
The worst picture ever was the single image featured on the apparently deceased website [http://worstpictureever.com worstpictureever.com.] The image itself is 800 pixels wide and 8000 pixels high, and is a simple but effective conglomeration of approximately 50 images of disgusting or horrifying nature, including, but by no means limited to, [[goatse]], [[shitting dicknipples]], [[tubgirl]], [[beecock]], sushi worms, various images of [[bestiality]], [[Pain series|penis modification]]s, and what appears to be [[Paul Wolfowitz]]. The page itself was entitled "BITING SOCIAL COMMENTARY", perhaps because of its inclusion of Mr. Wolfowitz on the same page as [[Hitler]] and [[Stalin]]. Many of the pictures also appear to have been taken from various alternative [[hentai]] boards, as the image has a wide variety of bizarre fetish images. All in all, the image is much like a roller coaster; it has its ups, it has its downs, but it's not nearly as sick as the [[pain series]].
