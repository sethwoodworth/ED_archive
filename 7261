[[Saudi Arabia]] is a desert that occupies all land that [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Cutter|Qatar]], [[Bah]][[rain]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], Oman, and Yemen [[DO NOT WANT|didn't want]]. Wherever those countries are not, Saudi Arabia is.

Unbelievably, it still has a [[king]] (never a [[Queen]]), as well as a [[fake|democratic parliament]] consisting of <s>cronies the king put in power</s> THE PEOPLE'S HOLY REPRESENTATIVES. Because it has more [[oil]] than anyone else, its several cities are actually modern with skyscrapers and shopping malls and other modern stuff. They have cool technology funded by oil-hungry [[white people]] as well as huge mosques which are practically the only things designed by the [[Arabs]] themselves, and a couple of fancy palaces for the King, all with stockpiles of porno movies, beer, and women's clothing. Then there are lots of shithole towns made of scrap metal and wood, tents belonging to rich camel-owning sheiks and their [[polygamy|72 wives]], oil fields scattered throughout the country, and a military base for the [[United States|American Empire]]; the rest of it is just miles after miles of worthless desert.

With [[fundamentalist|strict Islamic law]] enforced by a cadre of highly armed and trained religious [[police]] who all want 72 virgins ready and willing to enforce it, [[South Africa|SA]] prides itself on being the most [[Muslim]] and least democratic or progressive society in the entire [[Earth|world]]. With [[wimmins|women]]'s rights constantly being reduced, bloody severed hands and feet in the streets, and constant gunshots and chopping sounds announcing the execution of an infidel, Saudi Arabia is a leading role model in the struggle to reverse human progress worldwide.

Friendly religious police from the [[tl;dr|Ministry of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice]] will be glad to assist you in meeting [[Allah]] personally, should you violate any of Shari'a law's [[Unrealistic Expectations|reasonable proscriptions]]. If they don't shoot you there and then, they will be happy to take you to a [[Internet court|Shari'a court]], where you will get a [[fake|fair trial]] and be found guilty. One of the following things will happen to you:

* You could be shot privately.
* You could be [[Spellcheck|beaheaded]] publicly in a place called "chop-chop square" with thousands of people watching for fun, since its the only fun you get in Saudi Arabia.
* You could be tied to a pole and have a stripper fall on your face. The stripper is Rosie O'donnel.
* Your hands or feet or both might be chopped off and confiscated. But glued back one you say "I'm Sorry".
* If you are lucky, you'll just get whipped until you are unable to sit down and not an inch of skin is left on your back.
* If your very lucky, you will get to listen to Sarah Palin talk about freedom and war on terror until you beg for mercy or ears bleed. 

==The right to die==

A bit like the Dignitas [[An Hero]] service, it is very easy to end one's life in Saudi Arabia. [[Christians]] are beheaded, Jews are beheaded, [[princesses]] are beheaded, people who drink alcohol are beheaded, fornicators are beheaded, adulterers are stoned to death, [[thieves]] are beheaded and homosexuals are beheaded, so a three-way drunken orgy with a member of minor royalty and a married rabbi in a stolen bed should do the trick.

==High standard of living==

All you have to do to have the best standard of living in the world is be a member of the [[The Royal Family|Royal House of Saud]]. Everything is [[free]], [[Israel|you are immune to the law and not even the Americans will try to tell you what to do]] - at which point you are encouraged to partake in some of Saudi Arabia's abundant pleasures. Popular activities include [[Fellatio|eating figs]], [[Sarah Palin|drilling]] for [[more]] [[delicious cake|delicious oil]], garrisoning [[United States|imperial crusader troops]], [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Urethra_play_saudi_arabia.JPG urethral play,] [[pedophilia]], and [[TsimFuckis|falconry]].

==Saudi Armed Forces==
[[Image:Camelgun2.JPG|thumb|250px|An [[elite]] gunnery unit of the Saudi Army.]]
Saudi Arabia has a shitty army due to the fact that most of the country is miles and miles of worthless sand. However, places like oil fields, the King's many palaces, and all of the Islamic <s>terrorist training camps</s> religious centers must be protected, so Saudi Arabia has 150,000 sandniggers in its army, and uses its oil money to pay whitey for cool-looking weapons and military equipment. However, the West has to train the Saudis, as the sandniggers are incapable of figuring it out for themselves ([[sarcasm|and yet they conquered North Africa and the entire Middle East]]). Although it has a lot of rustbucket tanks and APCs made in [[Russia]] and America (both countries want the oil), most of its transport consists of indigenous camels. Suicide vests, car bombs, and half-functioning Russki-style mortars are all military hardware produced locally.

==Tourism==

Whereas, say, in the [[UK]], Mecca is merely a chain of [[gambling|Bingo]] halls, in Saudi Arabia, Mecca is much better, and has more holiness per square [[foot]] than any [[crap]] sandy [[hell]][[hole]] in the whole world. However, anyone who is found sneaking in wearing a false [[beard]] will be beheaded. And if you are a [[Muslim]], expect to pay one Saudi rial ($10,000 in other [[money]]) for the pleasure of owning a pair of shitty white pyjamas in which to visit the holy sites, along with about 6,000,000 other ''[[Iraq|Hajji]]s'' who will gladly trample you until you are as one with the hallowed ground.

==Lawrence of Arabia==

Lawrence of Arabia was a [[Britfag]] who invented [[S&M]], [[camel]] fucking, stealing oil, and killing yourself on a [[motorcycle]]. Whilst avoiding being sectioned by the British [[Army]], he disappeared into the desert (a bit like that bloke from the [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Doctor Who|Dune]]'') and was responsible for bringing oil, personal hygiene, writing, [[electricity]], [[toilet|piped water]], roads, [[television]], Western [[pop music]], [[cocaine|Coca Cola]], and toilet paper to Saudi Arabia. He wrote ''The Koran For Dummies'' and introduced the [[Turks]] to male homosexuality.

==Scimitars==

Saudi Arabia is famous for its [[sword|scimitars]]. Their flag has a scimitar, their coat of arms has two scimitars, and they'll cut your [[head]] off for you with a scimitar.

Other famous scimitars include:

*Reliant Scimitar, a sports [[car]]
*FV107 Scimitar, a type of light tank
*Supermarine Scimitar, a fighter aircraft 
*''HMS Scimitar'', the name of three warships
*Scimitar [[cat]] ([[Homo]]therium serum), an extinct species of the cat family
*Scimitar-horned Oryx (Oryx dammah), a [[PETA|critically endangered]] antelope species
*Scimitar, an [[noob|entry-level]] cymbal series from Zildjian
*Scimitar ([[Star Trek]]), a [[fiction]]al Reman starship commanded by Shinzon in the film ''Star Trek: Nemesis''
*[[win|Shit scimitar-shaped letter-openers sold all over the Islamic world to tourists]]
*A scimitar is a [[Dungeons and Dragons|light, one-handed, martial melee weapon that deals 1d6 slashing damage and has an 18-20/x2 crit range]]. It accounts for four pounds of [[The Giver|encumbrance]] and can be used as an [[fap|off-hand weapon]] without penalty; market value 15 [[gold|gp]], [[Erection|hardness]] 10, 5 [[Harry Potter|hp]].

{{squote|If I went around, saying I was an emperor, because some moistened bint lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!|[[Monty Python|Dennis]]}}

"[[ho|Bint]]" being the Arabic for "[[wife|daughter]]."
==The King==

The great King of Saudi has the biggest [[Vagina|vagina]] ([[wikileaks]]). Scholars have compared the size to [[Paris hilton]]'s backdoor. Researchers have confirmed that this size originates from his father. Fahd, the father of the current King, was the founder of [[Burger King]], and worked there for many years until Ronald MacDonald robbed his branch, his wife, his kids (the gregory brothers). He is mostly famous for doing something("nothing") for his country. It was during his reign when Bill Clinton visited him in the royal palace. Fahd was particularly upbeat and researched the entire InTRaNeT and learned everything about the US President, and the first lady, [[Monica Lewinsky|Monica_lweinsky]]. Following the visit, Clinton was famously quoted as sayying," The guy [Fahd] is coked out of his freakin mind. It's a miracle how this guy is in power. Talking to him was like talking to a Goat !! "

Currently, the country is ruled by King Abdulala-laleleleh. He is an educated individual, and studied Rooster Fertilization during his 14 year education at university of Kazakhestan. After he was kicked out of the program, his father gave him his job, and he became the next KING OF the desert. In his first year, he appointed a cabinet of intellectuals such as George bush, King Kong, and Peter Griffin. He was quite successful during his first day as a Monarch. According to Fox news, King Abulala's approval rating kept rising, and even surpassed Adolf Hitler's approval rating post WWII. King Abulala, impressed by this statistics, then decided to wear glasses to look intellect. So starting the second day at work, eerBody knew him as the fat, ugly guy that wears prada. In jan 2011, his highest achievements were: Backstabbing his partners and talking to a crowd of 3000 and putting all 3000 of the camels to sleep. It was later determined they one of the camels was actually paris hilton.  He has stated that once he sells all his oil, he would officially come out of the closet. Until then, he is determined to model all of [[Elton John's|Elton_john]] eyewears. In his blog, Elton John has repeadedly asked King Abulala to [[STFU]] and has  filed a complaint in response to King abulala's claim of being the inspiration behind the Lion King song.
