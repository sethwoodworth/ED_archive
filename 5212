Martini-chan
[[Image:Martini Chan014.jpg|thumb|Ugghhhh]]
'''Martini-chan''' is a [[/b/tard]] who was made famous in the summer of '07 by posting pics of herself [[piss|urinating]] and drinking it out of a martini glass to the dismay of thousands. 

Later, her [[MySpace]] account was found and hilarity ensued when countless [[Anonymous]] spammed her friends with her piss drinking photos. The lurkers later tracked down her [[Dox|real name, address, phone number, and all other information]] in an attempt to [[pwn|publicly humiliate]] her. One group even managed to find the GPS coordinates of her new house and posted the results. Unfortunately an admin got wind of the [[lulz|thread]] and it was [[unfunny|quickly deleted]]; and by quickly, we mean after at least two hours.
