Online relationship
When [[fat]] people are unable to find [[love]] [[irl]], they inevitably engage in a [[lie|relationship]] through a [[internet|series of tubes]]. Although participants are generally 30 years old and up, their antics often resemble those of [[16 year old girl|high school]] students.

According to the interwebz, [[fat|fatties]] should keep the following in mind:
* These are [[troll|people]] you are [[fap|dealing]] with. Always remember that. They are not virtual entities. They are no less (and no more) real than the people in your everyday, offline life.
* [[in the ass|Treat others]] online as [[rimjob|you would wish to be treated]].
* [[noone|Not everyone]] on the [[internet|Net]] will share your values or your [[necrophilia|sensitivities]]. Check out [[4chan|newsgroups]] and mailing lists before you join them. [[b|Some newsgroups permit flames]]; some permit [[in the ass|"rugged, direct interchanges"]] that don't cross over into [[gay|flaming]]; some require [[tubgirl|polite, considerate exchanges]]. Choose the groups where you feel comfortable.
* If you frequent [[irc|chat rooms]], keep in mind that it's [[lie|possible]] to develop very strong relationships with [[troll|people]] online, relationships that are different in quality and character from anything you've experienced [[irl|offline]]. The [[anonymous|anonymity]] of the Net lets you judge and be judged on factors other than [[Prussian Blue|race]], [[16 year old girl|age]], [[sex]], disability and so on. That can be very intoxicating. Beware this intoxication.
* The [[anonymous|anonymity]] of the Net also encourages [[rape|deception]]. People online frequently [[lie]] about their identity. This goes way beyond giving a [[moot|false name]] to go with an online ID. The Net is also littered with people who have spent a [[over 9000|very long]] time getting to [[cyber|know someone "intimately" online]] only to find they've been [[holocaust|misled]]. There are three huge things missing from online relationships: [[irl|physical presence, social context, and everyday experience]]. The person you get to know online is not the [[internet disease|complete picture]]: remember this before offering your [[419 Nigerian Email Scams|personal details]], your money, your heart, or your life.
