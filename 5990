==How it works==
You need to inject the two JavaScript files in the omegle page, it will give them permission to send network messages to Omegle, which is exactly what Omegle does.

The file "omegle.js" contains an unofficial API to communicate with the Omegle server. The other file, called "troll.js" uses that API to connect to Omegle and send random messages.
