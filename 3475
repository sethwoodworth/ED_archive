Great Wall of Mexico
[[Image:Noillegals.jpg|thumb|right|Seriously. Think about it.]]
'''The Great Wall of Mexico''' was [[cock|erected]] by [[George W. Bush]] in 2006. It was constructed in order to prevent [[Jews]], [[Mexicans]] and [[Furries]] from crossing over into the [[USA|United States]]. You can help by writing about this in your [[LiveJournal]], but trust us, [[nobody gives a shit]].

Discussions are still being held in regards to the US-[[Canada]] border. Canada is pre-ejaculating with delight at the prospect of ridding their land of [[American]] teenagers looking for [[weed]]. 

== Failure ==
Although the Great Fence is supposed to stop beaners from getting into the US, it has failed on many, many, many occasions.  Probably due to the fact that Mexicans jump fences everyday to steal your stereos, various lawn equipments, and burrito making materials.   
Most Mexicans jump the Great Fence, some get help from furries and dig tunnels, while others just walk around. Some challenges a Mexican might face once getting over the fence are: [[Texas|Texans]], the Alamo, [[Ron Paul|People with two first names]], [[W|W]], [[Creationist|Creationists]], and [[Republicans|Republicans]].  Also, [[Retard|someone]] accidentally [[Fail|built a 30 mile section of the fence like 10 miles into Mexico]]
