The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
'''''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''''' ('''H2G2''') has provided three generations with their first tastes of [[lulz]]. Since the late 70's, the media has been milking the genius of creator Douglas Adams. Originally a radio series, ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' has been adopted by various forms of media, including novels, games, and films. The series' adaptability (yes, even that [[crappy]] movie), has ensured that nerds in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century continue to learn about the series. ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' is also another example of why Europeans are better at writing than Americans.

42 is the most significant number in H2G2 culture. 42 is the answer to [[furries|The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]]. H2G2 fans would often give "42" as the answer to any question that you're given. This, of course, is [[unfunny]].

The series was so popular that it inspired of the first [[copypasta]]s and [[old meme]]s. In an 80's Infocom computer game adaption of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', there is an lulzy excerpt about how "careless talk costs lives". Whenever a [[newfag]] overuses a [[meme]] such as "[[disregard that]]", you may feel the urge to say, "[[Shut the fuck up]]. Stop using that meme". Nevertheless, you ought to say it with more class by using the following copypasta in order to display your [[oldfag|oldfaggotry]] and knowledge of the obscure (note: "disregard that" is only an example; you may use whichever meme you wish):

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">
<p>It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated. For instance, at the exact moment you said "DISREGARD THAT" a freak wormhole opened in the fabric of the space-time continuum and carried your words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle.</p>

<p>The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time. A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the Vl'Hurgs, resplendent in his black jeweled battle shorts, gazed levelly at the G'Gugvunt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green, sweet-smelling steam. As a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric death at his single word of command, the Vl'Hurg challenged his vile enemy to take back what it had said about his mother.</p>

<p>The creature stirred in its sickly broiling vapour, and at that very moment the words "DISREGARD THAT" drifted across the conference table. Unfortunately, in the Vl'Hurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries. Eventually the error was detected, but over two hundred and fifty thousand worlds, their peoples and cultures perished in the holocaust.</p>

<p>You have destroyed most of a small galaxy. Please pick your words with greater care.</p>
