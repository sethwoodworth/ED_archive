An '''audiophile''' is a person who is into otic sex, that is sex with ears. It comes from the Greek ''audios'', sound, and ''philos'', fucking. Audiophiles also will have sex with CDs and [[BDSM|tie themselves up]] with speaker cable. Especially pretentious audiophiles will favor old vinyl records, saying they feel [[Hott|"warmer"]].  When they can't get something on vinyl, they will attempt to run everything else through an expensive tube processor to make it sound [[Hott|"warmer"]].

An audiophile can be spotted by their habit of complaining about [[MP3]]s and using only [[FLAC]], because the high frequency sounds that even your [[buy a dog|dog]] can't hear get stripped out in compression.

Audiophiles will often spend [[at least 100]] dollars on gold speaker cable, because they think that the raw pretentiousness will make them have an audiorgasm. Sadly for them, there is no known mechanism that can make [[My Chemical Romance|MCR]] sound any good. Audiophiles are all deaf, however, and as a result they can't actually tell the difference between those $5 earphones you bought at Go-Lo and $250 Sennheiser HD555s.

True audiophiles will spend $50,000 on designer hand-made speakers, $7,000 speaker cable, $10,000 in power filtering equipment and a $5,000 vinyl player, and still won't be able to tell the difference between it and a $500 system without lying through their teeth.

==How to spot an Audiophile==
*If outdoors (rare) will be wearing three sets of noise - canceling headphones, because one just doesn't cut it.
*Will have no money for little things like gas, food or clothes.
*Will have a 160GB [[Mitchell_Henderson|iPod]] with only three songs on it, due to their compulsion to have everything completely uncompressed.
*Will probably be a [[Apple|Mac]] user.
*Will spend $120 on a Telefunken-branded triode when Sovtek sells the same damn tube for eight dollars, and will claim to be able to tell the difference.
*Will have the vast majority of their house (mortgaged) full of their sound system, which will sound shit because audiophiles all think that broken "classic" parts [[pwn]] modern things like 7:1 surround sound.
*Bought the 2009 Beatles Mono Box set, [[what|which somehow costs more than the stereo set]].

*Alternatively, you can tell them that the high frequencies that they can't actually hear could possibly cancel some of the frequencies that they ''can'' hear. This will make them question everything they have ever known.

==Audiophiles pwned for good==

{{squote|My brother, an audio engineering whiz kid has proven to me what is real and what is not. We gathered up 5 of our audio buddies. We took my "old" Martin Logan SL-3 (not a bad speaker for accurate noise making) and hooked them up with Monster 1000 speaker cables (decent cables according to the audio press). They were connected to an ABX switch box allowing blind fold testing. The music was played. Of the 5 blind folded, only 2 guessed correctly which was the monster cable. Keeping us blind folded, my brother switched out the Belden wire (are you ready for this) with simple coat hanger wire! After 5 tests, none could determine which was the Monster 1000 cable or the coat hanger wire. Further, when music was played through the coat hanger wire, we were asked if what we heard sounded good to us. All agreed that what was heard sounded excellent.|Dr. Bob Dean}}

{{squote|If you're in the business of selling high end audio then it becomes very important to discover to what extent the golden ears are or are not full of it. Bob Carver did a little hands on research at a mid '70s trade show to shed some light on these suspicions. He displayed an impressive system openly. I don't recall the model number but it had the separate tube amps for the right and left channel. It had the oxygen free gold wire to interconnect the type of components that ultra audiophiles have wet dreams about: hand crafted capacitors and resistors and transistors matched to six 9s precision in gain and so on and so forth. In any case the system displayed was in the $30k range at the time. The speakers were no less expensive and no doubt exquisitely hand matched to the amps. But here is where the joke comes in. The speakers were connected to a $200 dollar range bookshelf stereo hidden behind a curtain. Carver injected pink noise into the ultra stereo and displayed the result on a spectrum analyzer. He then set the bookshelf system to a moderate volume and EQed it with the same pink noise as input until it matched the spectrum of the ultra stereo. As long as the controls on the bookshelf were not tampered with, it's sound was good approximation of the ultra stereo at the same moderate volume. He told the audience that he had a top secret experimental system behind the curtain and wanted to field test it to ensure he was on the right track. With some audiophile grade vinyl classical as the input he switched between the ultra stereo (which they COULD see and were familiar with) and the "top secret" bookshelf system behind the curtain.  Lo and behold! The bookshelf system had far better "aural spaciality.........." I've known salesmen who have done this same thing several times with the same result. I suppose this goes a long way toward explaining the audiophile aversion to double blinded A/B listening tests. Those A/B switches must introduce some truly horrible "multiphasic inhibited frequency shifts" into the signal. |dmaxwell}}
