As with any sort of [[RL]] contact information, '''phone numbers''' are powerful tools in the work of spreading [[drama]].  Closely related to [[Power Word]], a phone number might also be used in a drama related attack on a person. If you call a [[girl]] you like, but she tells you to never call her again you can always make [[prank call|prank calls]] to her for the rest of your [[luser]] life.

Idea! Put Phone numbers here to prank call instead. Here's the first one:

Number of a guy in Canada who thinks some troll on the internet wants to find him:

418-522-6238

===Example===

'''Prima''': Secunda is a stupid whore.

'''Secunda''':  Call 715-555-1234 and ask for Jenny.

'''Prima''':  You bitch!  That's my number! [[libel]]!


----


Phone numbers were also the primary means of [[sex]] before the internets brought along [[cyber]]ing

===Example===

'''Prima''': Hey there, [[hawt|hot stuff]], looking for a good time?

'''Secunda''': [[Virgin|Hurr, yeah. You sound sexy]]

'''Prima''': Well, just call me at 1-900-[[fat|FAT]]-[[whore|SLUT]], so me and my friends can [[phone sex|sex you up]]. I'll just need your [[Identity theft|credit card, social security number, driver's license number, home address, date of birth, and your mother's maiden name]]

'''Secunda''': [[Idiot|Okay!]]
