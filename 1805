==What the fuck is it?==
The Covini C6W is a vehicle made entirely of [[win]]. It has six wheels, can go at 186 m.p.h., and is made by [[guido|guidos]]. This car has fucked your wife before and took [[over 9000]] years to build because win is something that cannot be simply compromised in a short time. When you ever see someone driving a Covini C6W (which you won't because you are [[fail|poor]]), then you must yell out [[FUCK YEAH SEAKING|FUCK YEAH COVINI C6W]] or else you will be a humongous faggot.
