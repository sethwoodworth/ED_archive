''''Wacqui' Jacqui Smith''' entered parliament on an [[Victim complex|affirmative action]] list and quickly became a minister of the United Kingdom and [[Neo-con|Labour]] party [[BDSM|Whip]] in the government of her fellow freedom-hater, [[Blair|Tony Bliar]].
Bliar's successor [[Gordon Brown]] stepped up the freedom-hating vibe by further elevating this talentless thing to [[Homeland Security|Home Secretary]], one of the big three positions. 

She claimed some porn on her expense account, someone checked and found it, and major [[fail]] was under way for Jacqui. [[Gordon Brown]] fired the cunt before she had the chance to become a really good [[ED]] article.

A total cow to start with, one theory is that the more powerful she got, the more her husband, Richard Timney, got impotent at the sight of her smug and bug-ugly face, so he took to wrapping her head in a paper bag and fucking her while watching [[extreme porn]]; maybe that isn't [[true]] and he was just into doing the [[fap|five-knuckle shuffle]] over [[gay]] [[porn]] and they are really just [[beard]]s for each other. 

==Student days==
From some [[BBS]].
 Days of whine and roses,
 pretentiously spelt name,
 could Jacqui have ever,
 been a human being?

==Nutty and Illegal: Domestic Project Echelon==

Wacqui Jacqui's biggest and most expensive [[fail|pet project]] is an illegal scheme to spy on every one of her fellow subjects of Her Majesty Elizabeth II. The idea is to record every Internet transaction and phone call made within the [[UK]] in a gargantuan database. The government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in general (and Wacqui Jacqui in particular) shows its absolute [[hate|contempt]] for the people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by not even bothering to do it legally. That's the advanced [[democracy]] of today for you.

==Gary McKinnon==
Goes without saying that Wacqui Jacqui Smith (inveterate bully) is the person most responsible for [[Gary McKinnon]]'s ill treatment. The bitch would go to any lengths for the rights of a real [[terrorist]], as long as the terrorist has the passport but isn't really a [[britfag]]. She's made the utmost efforts to have this harmless and intelligent [[UFO]] fan extradited to a lifetime of [[antilulz|boredom]] and probable [[buttsecks|butt]][[rape]] in a US maximum-security [[prison]]. Understandably, Gary [[Do not want|does not want]] this.

==TV Academics==
No, the TV here doesn't mean [[transvestite]], it means [[television]]; like [[Obama|Half-black Jesus, whose daddy juss squirted and ran]] trying to recruit [http://news.aol.com/article/gupta-withdraws-from-surgeon-general/372122?cid=12 this TV prick] as Surgeon-General of the USA, Wacqui Jacqui likes to recruit [[retards|media "psychologists"]] as fake experts who will back up her malicious schemes.

==Busted: Extreme Porn on Expense Account==
[[Image:Raw meat by robert timney request.jpg|thumb|Oi guvnah, I din't nevar know that was banned by the wifey. We watched it, y'know. With a bag on her head an' all, like y'do.

Wacqui Jacqui was [[unwarranted self-importance|arrogant]] enough to claim her video download expenses as part of her parliamentary communications expenses. Someone checked, and found five downloaded videos, two were [[extreme porn]]. The other three were ''Oceans 13'' ([[OMG]] twice!!1!) and ''Surf's up''! Dear me, what a [[Epic Fail Guy|connoisseur]].

[[Wikileaks|Everyone]] is wondering just what the two extreme porn titles were. The ''Daily Telegraph'' has reason to believe it was [[gay]] flick ''Raw Meat 3'' and ''By Special Request'', which is just about impossible to find or doesn't exist and is probably the title of some kind of 'Best of' or favourites programme.

==Fired==
[[Last Thursday]], [[retard|Gordon Brown]] fired her. [[Some argue|Supposedly]], this was due to her expenses claims for pron and for using expenses to claim [[Over 9000|Â£116,000]] to buy her sister a house, although it is just as likely that even Gordon Brown realised she was completely [[fucktarded]] and making his government look even worse than it already is.
