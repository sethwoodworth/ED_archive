All In The Family
[[Image:All_in_the_family.jpg|thumb|Fuck this shit.]]

A long-running sitcom based around the "lovable" bigot, Archie Bunker (and totally ripped-off from a British sitcom about a "lovable" bigot, Alf Garnett). Thankfully, the last time anyone gave a shit about this show was 1979, back when it was still shocking to hear the word "spade" on television. Despite being [[shit]], it has been tributed on many occasions. Especially that fucking opening sequence where Archie and his wrinkly vegetable of a wife sing [[gay|"Those Were The Days"]].

'''''[[Incest|All In The Family]]''''' is also directly responsible for ''[[Gay|The Jeffersons]]'' and ''[[American Dad]]'', which is a mixup update of the ''All In The Family'' format. Another [[Unfunny|funny]] variation on ''All In The Family'' is ''[[Family Guy]]'' but now with [[sex]] jokes every five seconds, which totally doesn't rip off the opening sequence. [[Obvious|Nope not at all]]. 

''All in the Family'' can be found listed on the television segment of any [[MySpace]] profile belonging to someone over the age of 35. You'll also get some lame 'alternative' college girl listing it as one of her favorite programs just so she can seem smart.
Aside from that, no one on the internet gives a shit about ''All In The Family''.
