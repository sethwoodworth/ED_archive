'''Protests''' are lame riots that never get off the ground. Things to do at a protest:

* [[Hippy|Sing ''We Shall Overcome'']]
* Discuss [[politics]]
* Go the fuck home before you get [[Rodney King]]ed

Protests are exclusively attended by the people least likely to have any fucking clue what they're talking about. For instance, a protest against the exploitation of [[Alien|foreign]] peoples will be attended exclusively by [[white]] [[psychology]] whose parents are paying for everything.

[[Women]] go to protests because they are momentarily [[Liberal guilt|filled with concern]] about whatever bullshit non-issue is ''en vogue''. Men go to get laid.

==How to Deal With Protesters==
Follow the lead of the Chinese government and dispense swift [[justice]]. If anyone looks mildly threatening or [[Alien|foreign]] then gang up on them and mash their simple peasant faces into the curb. After shooting them in the head a few times, check their wallet, locate their family [[kill]] their family to teach them a lesson. 
Also then cut off the [[internet]] for the entire country to prevent anybody finding out what you have done. If that doesn't work then simply walk into the nearest village and get [[viking]] on their ass! Rape, pillage, kill, burn everything in site (in that order). Repeat this step by moving from village to village until you run out of villages.

==Famous Protests==
The most famous protest in [[US]] history is probably Kent State. On [[At least 100 years|May 4, 1970]], the Ohio National Guard staged a protest against George McGovern at Kent State [[University]]. While peacefully protesting, they were attacked by a group of foul-smelling [[hippies]]. The assailants were so unwashed that the National Guardsmen naturally assumed they were brain-eating [[zombie]]s and opened fire. 

People now realize that protests are pointless. As such, protests have declined [[drama]]tically over the last generation as can be seen in these comparative photos:
