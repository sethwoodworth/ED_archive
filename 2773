'''Eye bleach''', the most commonly used bleach in the 21st century. Typically used after viewing images such as [[goatse]], [[tubgirl]] and [[Furry art|the myriad of other degenerate pictures]] that turn up on the Internet ad infinitum. 

''Warning'' - overuse of eye bleach can lead to blindness, skin irritation and [[AIDS|beriberi]].

Preferably use a highly concentrated chlorine bleach as opposed to semen
