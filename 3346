Girlvinyl's vagina
[[Image:Special1.jpg|thumb|Raaaaaaaaaaaar! Note: [[P-p-p-powerbook!|This is Real.]]]]

In outer space, there are things called [[LHC|black holes]].  Wondrous and terrible to behold, these horrifying miracles of physics are capable of attracting all kinds of space junk, stars, and planets into their gaping maws.  They are a force to be reckoned with, and are [[inscrutable]] even by the standards of modern [[science]].

[[Girlvinyl]]'s [[Vagina]] is something like that.

An immensely powerful entity created to make mice out of otherwise strong-willed [[men]], it exists in one place in the real world, but its power extends to many different places on the [[internets]], from the most [[e-popular]] [[LiveJournal]] communities to the craziest [[Wikipedia]] entries.

It is also rumored to be the [[final solution|final doomsday weapon]] of the [[Worldwide Masonic conspiracy]], should all other plans come to naught. 

==The Secret to Its Power==

Its power is housed deep within the caverns of the vagina.  Unfortunately, the only entity brave enough to explore it, [[Quasidan's penis]], suffered a horrible fate and was rendered speechless.

Because of its wide reach and vice-like grip on the [[Penis|shaft]] of society, it must be held in a chastity belt until the right [[hero]] can come along and harness its power.

Until then, we shall all live in fear and awe.

==Centipedes==
It is currently unknown if Girlyinyl's vagina contains [[centipedes]]. There is a rumor that research is being done to find out.
