'''On [[Brb, compromised|Friday December 14, 2007]]''', /[[b/]] exploded with fail as a result of all the [[newfags]] and [[fail]] that had encompassed it as a result of [[moot|faggot's]] homosexuality. /b/-tards everywhere shit their pants in desperation as [[4chan]] went off the [[interbutts]] forever. The faggots responsible, http://ididitforthelulz.com, declared victory over the legion of Anonymous. [[Epic]] [[fail]] ensued. The imageboards were replaced with a single php board. As the [[aspie]]s of /b/ fled to the [[ED|land of legend]] and other assorted *chans the prophets examined the ancient scripture for advice. After careful examination most of the ancients quickly became [[an hero]]es until only [[Ceiling Cat]] remained. He raced from board to board spamming a very clear message...

==OH SHI-==

[[Image:Ceilingomen.jpg|thumb|right|[[OH SHI-|Catnarok is Nigh!]]]]

The holy scripture's prophecy had almost been fulfilled.

It reads...'''<i>As [[Longcat]] and [[Tacgnol]] prepare their armies to march from the ends of the Earth, and people everywhere [[buy a dog|buy dogs]] and put up curtains they will meet on the chosen battleground of [[300|Thermopylae]]. As all fades into black they will meet on high noon of the [[Caturday Nap|second lost]] [[Caturday]].</i>'''

The end of the world was near. Old memes were spewed at an astronomical rate. [[Unfunny]] [[newfags]] and [[TL;DR]] copypasta ruled all posting. Furfags and Tartlets ran free of [[fursecution]]. Trolls were alone and failing at unheard of rates. [[Pool's Closed|Pool's were closed]] due to incurable [[AIDS]].  

And the Fatherchan had died...again.

Caturday was a mere 24 hours away. And the world seemed doomed to wail in an [[gaia|ocean of piss]].

==This is why we can't have nice things.==

[[Image:Catcrush9.jpg|thumb|right|The final straw.]]

Some [[batshit insane|individuals]] had a radical idea that [[NEDM|not even doom music]] could rationalize...[[Wang Jeu|To kill all cats]]. And so it would begin. Large gas [[lollercaust|chambers]] and concentration camps were erected. The [[Jews]] who were counting their [[money|gold]] ran in [[lulz|terror]]. [[Baby Fuck|Kittens were taken, fucked, and left to die]]. [[God Hates Fags]] rallied the forces and continued to slay any cat who so much licked itself trying to get the blood out. And as the cat [[holocaust|genocide]] continued all hope seemed lost.

High noon was fast approaching. /b/-tards were rioting due to the lack of ability to post any fucking cats. And then all hell broke loose. The /b/-tards and [[sick fucks|cat fuckers]] collided in the sacred ground of [[Auschwitz]]. Each side was determined to [[pwn|kill]] the other. With [[Cho]] and the [[Pekka-Eric Auvinen|Finnisher]] doling out numerous [[Headshot|headshots]] and once again upping their [[kill ratio]], it was a scene of complete and utter chaos.

==Chicken Mootle Soup==

[[Image:Souppuzzle.jpg|thumb|left|We're all fucked.]]

[[LOTR|But then, something completely unexpected happened.]] [[Moot]] stopped sipping his [[Brb, soup|soup]] and retrieved the almighty [[banhammer]] that he had sworn off forever. From the [[bday|great exodus of yesteryear]] it [[Cum|came]], and as the irresistible force of faggotry tried to corrupt Moot further he resisted. He returned from [[Mootxico]] wielding the [[over 9000|awesome power]].

At first the going was tough. [[XyriX]] gathered his forces in the east for an all out [[orgy]] towards becoming the greatest [[an heroes]] in history. The attack on 4chan's DNS had worked perfectly. There were guards surrounding every crevice. There was no way in. [[One does not simply X into Mordor|One does not simply walk into 4chan.]]

Moot seemed trapped and fell into despair. He had lost his [[Mitchell Henderson|iPod]] in a raid of [[niggers|orcs]] on the first night out. He had [[waaaambulance|scraped his knee]] and hadn't eaten anything but a [[cum|clear white liquid]] in days. He was never [[Ripper|hardcore]] enough to [[pwn]] the guards. So he did what all bitches did, and he cried for his mom. Little did he know that, that singular act would lead to his solution. His years of [[homosexuality|experience]] gave him the answer like a river of hot torrid lava exploding from a singular [[I Came|point]]. As with every gay entity there is a single weak [[Ass|spot]].  And that's when he decided that he would have to [[rape]] his way in.

As he approached the [[goatse|Great Ass]] of Mordor, Mootle had a difficult time with his decision. He was, of course a virgin, and pleasing the great ass of Mordor is a difficult and strenuous task. He finally thought of [[your mom|his mom]] and went to town. The Great Ass was unsatisfied with his meager member and proceeded to take him whole. And as he passed through he finally became aware of what all /b/ knows...You can never have enough [[Stick It In Her Pooper|pooper]].

He now proceeded upward into the fires of Mount Fail and straight into the clutches of the [[skiddies]]. He was continually jerked around by his server's [[CeLe|administration]]. And in the end even the 4chan status blog fell. All hope seemed lost.

But, in the final minutes before high noon in an unprecedented move to aide Mootle in his quest, the [[V&|4chan party V&]] bore his [[blowjob|burden]]. Together they would [[buttsecks|bond]] to rid the internet of the [[faggots]] forever, giving them an express trip on an [[prison|IRL Banhammer]], and throwing them right into the loving arms of [[Bubba]]. 4chan had only been offline for less than [[EFG|two full days]].

==The Caturday Revival==

In the end many lives were claimed. The [[furries]] and [[gaiafags]] protecting the kittens had all been slaughtered. The sick fucks and [[racists]], who had attacked, had been thoroughly beaten into submission. The [[skiddies]] got [[V&]]. Moot finally got more of his delicious [[soup]]. The great cleansing of /b/ had finally come to pass, and the [[Eternal September]] that had enveloped /b/ finally ended.

The great day of reawakening would therefore be known as '''The Caturday Revival'''.  And thus, the denizens of /b/ rejoiced as [[Niggertits]] was safe for another Caturday.
