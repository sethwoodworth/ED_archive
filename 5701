Much like [[Internet Tough Guy]] Syndrome, '''Nerd Rage''' (aka '''Angry on the Internet''' or '''Internet Angry Guy''') is usually found via vast quantities of bunched panties in the underwear drawers of the [[Viagra|impotent]] male [[basement dweller]] with huge levels of [[USI]] and [[borderline personality disorder]]. Howevar, whereas the former could potentially kick your ass [[IRL]], the Internet Angry Guy is moar akin to the typical [[13|98 lb weakling]] that gets sand kicked in his face courtesy of [[John Cena|Mr. Atlas]].

This breed of [[netizen]], can be found everywhere, but mostly choose [[YouTube]] to [[vent]] their anger however [[SFB|INTERNETS SERIOUS BUSINESS]]! forums like [[Enturbulation]] and /[[r9gay]]/ are also popular with these [[blowhard]]s.

==Pure Nerd Rage==
[[Image:Sparkanoid.png|center]]





Pure Nerd Rage is commonly found in forums and/or voice chat over the [[Internets]] that usually include stupid ass shit that [[noone]] knows or gives a [[fuck]] about. These rages and outbursts usually lead to [[Your mom]], your obvious need for an education, your pure retardidnessardation and that [[you suck]]. Period.

If you give in to a nerd rage or try to fight it [[AND LOSE]] you should check the size of your balls, if you are, in fact, a REAL boy and especially make sure that you arent secretly a Jew.

To effectively make a nerd rager [[STFU]], you must follow these steps;
1. Kill him

2. Kill his mom

3. Kill him and his mom                                      [[Image:NERD RAAAAAAGE.jpg|right|thumb| Its a GEOPOLITICAl continent...fucking mexican jew lizard who thinks hypoglycemic nitrate is a sugar...]]

4. Become a giant eraser and erase him

5. eat him

6. In the rare cases that he is infact a she, or, in different words a 'hemophrodite' or a '[[Lady Gaga]]', tap her on the head and silently say in her ear with a hot, steamy, sexy voice that you probably do not possess ;'OMG, ur 500 l337' and proceed to jumping off a cliff just for [[teh]] [[lulz]].

==How To Troll An AIG==

===Put A Custom Title Under His Name===

===Dome Him===
[[ITT]]: an [[Enturb]] mod decides to [[NERD RAGE]] against general [[Chanology]] faggotry in the [[THUNDERDOME]]. For [[Epic win|Double Hapiness]], said mod then posts the [[copypasta]] on ED's Enturbulation [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Enturbulation&diff=1997561162&oldid=1997560991 page].

==[[Troll|CALLOUT: ALL OF U]]==

'''OH, DROP YOUR [[unwarranted self-importance|EGO]] EVERY FAGGOT THAT THINKS THEY ARE ANY MORE THAN A COG IN THE MACHINE OF [[anonymous|ANON]], [[lie|THANKS FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION]], STOP TRYING TO HERD CATS, STFU YOU'LL GET GRATITUDE WHEN THE [[scientology|COS]] IS DONE FOR.'''

==Response==
In this case, the [[Angry Internet Guy]] being trolled is [[User_talk:dr3k|another mod at Enturb]] and will predictably a).  [[THUNDERDOME#Drama.3F_In_My_Thunderdome.3F|DOME the post]] if he finds it on the [[LNN|Breaking News]] discussion board, b). [[revert]] the [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Enturbulation&diff=next&oldid=1997561162 edit on ED] and then, c). start [[BAW|nerdily raging]] all over [[THUNDERDOME]], #enturbulation [[IRC]] and ED (where he is [[:Image:Aspirations.jpg|an imaginary mod]]).

This is where the [[peanut gallery]] chimes in and [[mocks]] the [[YHBT|trollee]] relentlessly.
