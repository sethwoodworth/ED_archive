According to [[rumors]], '''Albus Dumbledore''', the [http://www.newsweek.com/id/50787 "Head Master"] of Hogwarts, may or may not have died in the 6th ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book. His killer may or may not have been '''Severus Snape'''. Were this the case, it would be accurate to say that '''Snape kills Dumbledore'''. 

In a dramatic turn of events, Dumbledore came out of the closet after he died ([[truth|srsly]]), and admitted that he likes it up the ass.

== History ==
The book ''[[Harry Potter]] and the Half-Blood Prince'' went on sale at midnight, July 16, 2005 in stores everywhere, much to the delight of 8-year-old girls, super-[[nerd]]s, [[pedophiles]] and people who obviously have nothing better to do with their time than read children's [[crap]]py fantasy novels. However, like every fucking ''Harry Potter'' book before it, [[OVER 9,000]] copies of it were [[I accidentally X|accidentally before the set date]]. In a [[obvious|shocking and unpredictable]] turn of events, someone with one of those early copies scanned a page in the book that revealed the major plot point onto the [[Internets]]. 

It spread like wildfire in minutes, and soon every other person online had trick-linked all their nerd friends, creating unbelievably high amounts of [[drama]] and [[lulz]]. This was intensified when J.K. Rowling swooped down on sites hosting the scanned pages with her team of [[Internet lawyer]]s threatening to take [[legal action]].  

=== LiveJournal ===

The [[meme]] eventually donkeypunched [[Livejournal]], with people creating troll accounts with names such as [http://users.livejournal.com/_dumbledoredies/profile _dumbledoredies] to serial add ''Harry Potter'' fans and spam ''Harry Potter'' communities with "SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE!" in [[Font size=5]] and/or [[marquee]]...'''''WITHOUT [[LJ cut|LJ-CUTS!]]'''''

One of the best parts about all of this being [[LJ Abuse]]'s refusal to do anything about it.

The drama is seriously [[A plus|A+++++]] and is currently in the process of being archived offsite for safe keeping in the event that any of it is deleted.

===Potter Crash Video===
The ending was spoiled for a group of people waiting outside a Barnes & Noble. Some guy in his mom's mini-van proclaimed "SNAPE KILLS DUMBULDORE!!" and someone screamed "NOOOOOOO!!!11 YOU BITHC!!1 YUO BTICH!11"[http://gprime.net/video.php/pottercrash]

It would have been moar funny if someone became [[an hero]] on film.

== The Hermione Theory ==

[[Image:hpsfb.gif|right|thumb|''Harry Potter'' is [[serious business]]!]]

[[Contrary to popular belief]], Hermione did NOT kill Dumbledore...this confusion spawned after she was a victim to Dumbledore's [[sharking]].

== Old meme ==
As of 04:18, 17 Jul 2005 (UTC), "Dumbledore dies" is an official [[old meme]]. Posting links to the [[YTMND]] sites below is currently considered [[unfunny]], especially since by now virtually everybody who would've been pissed off at being spoiled has already read the book [[OVER 9,000]] times. 

However, there are still many slow [[idiot|readers]] who have yet to finish or even begin the book. In these cases, using this meme is acceptable. Here's a nice way to slip under their guard:

:Prima: "Hey everyone! Why did the chicken cross the road?" (Any joke set-up will do)
:Secunda: "I dunno, why?"
:Prima: "Because SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE OMG PAGE606PWND!"

== Snape killed... ==
Despite being old meme, The Great Dumbledore Dies Meme of 2005 spawned other [[mini meme]]s, like the '''Snape killed…''' meme, an offshoot [[catchphrase]]. However, it is only used by the most [[fucktard]]ed LJ users.

=== Examples ===
*Snape killed...the radio star!
*Snape killed...[[your mom]]!
*Snape killed...Edward Cullen! (if only)
*Snape killed...Padmé!
*Snape killed...my father...PREPARE TO DIE!
*Snape killed...Jeebus Cripes

=== Hate Crime ===
Due to a decrease in the output of fan fiction since the release of ''Deathly Hallows'', Rowling [http://www.newsweek.com/id/50787 announced to the public] that Albus Dumbledore was gay, and fancied having taken it up the ass from Grindelwald in his younger years. This resulted in the charges against Severus Snape being upgraded to a [[discrimination|hate crime]]; however, the charges were immediately dropped when it was pointed out that [[fags]] are supposed to get thrown off of tall structures, as determined by the Wizengamot in the late 16th century. By way of an apology, Snape was allowed to carry out sentence by Avara Kedavaraing Dumbledore's [[goatse|slack ass]] off the Hogwarts battlements.
