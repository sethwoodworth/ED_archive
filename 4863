'''[[Texas|Cactus fuckers]]''' also known as '''Linkin Park''' (Often [[Faggot|fagged]] up as Lincoln Park by Grammar Nazis) is a [[Shit|shitty]] band that is known for having the most headache-inducing, screaming, [[angst]]-filled lyrics in history.  This constant, pointless fake-rage makes them immensely popular with the current generation of [[Goth|depressed]] [[The Law of Conformity|non-conforming]] spoiled [[teenagers]] living in the [[suburbs]] that think their lives are hard. They are known throughout the [[internets]] by being on nearly every [[LiveJournal]] post (under "listening to") and being the soundtrack to '''''EVERY SINGLE''''' [[AMV]] on [[YouTube]]. There is a [[Lie|rumor]] that they were once a decent band, back when they weren't fucking capitalist pop stars. Instead, they were broke guys who made [[Loser|demo tapes in Shinoda's mom's bedroom]] who called themselves [[Xenu|Xero]]. [[Some argue]] that they are [[Lie|pioneers of rap-metal]] but it is a known fact that [[Oldfag|Rage Against The Machine]] has done it long ago, and Faith No More did it before them with the song "[[Epic]]," proving that Linkin Park are in fact [[newfag|posers]]. Members include a [[skinhead]], a [[wigger]], a [[Evildoer Korea|gook]] as a DJ, two [[Jews]] and a [[douchebag]]. Well at least they don't have [[DOUBLE NIGGER|double jewish rappers]] like [[Shit|Crazy Town]]. 

==Lyrical Themes==
[[Image:Lj-cut.gif|thumb|Typical Linkin Park subject matter.]]
Linkin Park specializes in [[angst]]-ridden music concerning such topics as [[depression]],[[circumcision|ants crawling up one's foreskin]],[[self injury]], [[Sob Story|being grounded by dad]], [[Mitchell_Henderson|loss of one's iPod]],being [[an hero]], being one step closer to [[Suicide|the edge]], getting [[rape]]d [[in the ass]] [[incest|by daddy]], being about to [[batshit insane|break]] and [[shit nobody cares about|the individual's suffering in an uncaring society of cruelty and ridicule]]. Every single word in every single Linkin Park song is a metaphor for either cocks or cock sucking. The average Linkin Park song contains the words "myself", "pain" and "lie(s)" [[over 9000]] times. In their newest album, they tried to prove that they have 'grown up' by providing shallow mockery of political themes. As usual fanbois dig it and proclaimed "THIS STUFF IS SO DEEP LOLX". Currently their music is used to aurally torture prisoners in Guantanamo.

CRAWWWWWLING IN MY SKINZZZZZZ. THIS ORRRRANGE WILL NOT PEEEEEEEEL!

==Musical Attributes==
[[Image:Sandwich-emo.jpg|thumb|Linkin Park [[fanart]].]]
Linkin Park basically decided to be [[trolling IRL|trolls IRL]] by crossing the two most abysmally horrid types of music ever conceived: [[pop]] and [[hip hop]]. Their painfully formulaic music generally consists of a simple synth melody (sometimes being spiced up with a flute or something [[OMG]]), which then launches into one of the three sets of grungy, heavily-distorted powerchord or drop-D chord progressions that they use for every song which basically repeats through the song, accompanied by the poppin' fresh [[rap]] of [[wigger|Mike Shinoda]] and the wistfully dulcet [[13 year old boy|prepubescent]]/ever-so-tormented screaming vocals of [[faggot|Chester Bennington]]. Mike Shinoda's robotic voice mercilessly spits verses of haiku as a pitiful excuse for lyrics. Also, their drummer is a Jew, and thoroughly enjoys [[Lemon Party]].  The guitarist WHO WEARS HEADPHONES EVERY FUCKING TIME is also a Jew, and had the bad luck of getting happily married before he became famous, therefore missing out on all the 16-year-old pussy the rest of the band regularly taps. If you don't believe that they are emo, listen to {{audio-url|http://www.mediafire.com/file/yzwtdlynate/04-Bleed%20It%20Out.mp3|"Bleed It Out"}}, though be warned. After listening to it, you'd wish you had a time machine so that you could go back in time and kill yourself before listening to "Bleed It Out" and consequently becoming emo.

(Warning: This song was written about tampons)

<blockquote>[[Forced meme|I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY I BLEED IT OUT DIGGIN DEEPER JUST TO THROW IT AWAY]]</blockquote>

In [[Last thursday|2002]] they released an OMG SO ATMOSPHERIC [[Rap|remix]] album [[retard|"Reanimation"]]. In this album, everyone in Linkin Park became niggers and [[OVER 9000]] guest rappers and mixers were called in to fag up their entire first album, which turned it from a train wreck into an air crash. Akin to polishing a [[Shit|turd]]. The song titles were also obviously re-written by a [[13-year-old]] which truly showed who's really behind the creative energy of the band. Among the exhibits of [[Leet|graet speln skillz]] were PTS.OF.ATHRTY, KRWLNG, RN>AWY, p5HING_ME_A//Y, [[OMG]]WTFBBQ and the smash hit KTHXBAI.



Linkin park has this super bonus special move! 
That's that they use one line repetitively in place of five separate ones.
Scientists believe that the average linkin park song contains roughly seven 
words and that the average album has almost fifteen!  what?

==WTF==
Many people have wondered what all the screaming is all about. Many Linkin Park fans were then butthurt over the following video (which incidentally wins on virtually every level, parodying the emotards without descending into unfunny ranting):
<center><youtube>JYNRhzX6gw8</youtube></center>

A [[fanboi]]'s reaction to the video:

{{quote|[[13 year old boy|lp is my favorite band okay and when i see this i just want to kome kick the shit out of you. Yer just saying you like LP becuz you don't want people to get mad. No true fan would do this shit. linkin park is the best band ever too bad you're 2 gay 2 realize that but shut the fuck up you're a fag if you diss lp plane and simple you deserve to go def because abvouslee you have no idea what good music is and i;ll b over ere with the smart people listening to lp. LP FORVER!!]]|[http://www.youtube.com/user/1PalPark a bawwing fanboy], abvouslee}}

Note how this rimjob enthusiast cleverly employs [[retard|interesting spelling variations]] of certain words in the hopes of his [[Dying_alone|poor grammatical existence]] seeming intentional.

{{quote|2:40 just takes the piss, linkin park's CD dont belong in the "bargin bin" they belong in the "WORLD'S﻿ BEST BAND". . . shop and 1:33 is true though i'm 13 but i got into LP at about 10|[http://www.youtube.com/user/26EMOARTLINKINPARK97 butthurt fanboy] , Starting to listen to LP when you are 10 years old is [[gay|cool]] }}

Note how Chester dryhumps his mic stand all throughout the video. He has a mic fetish.

==Minutes to Midnight Pre-Release==
Before their new album "Minutes to Midnight" could be released, the whole album was leaked, and [[over 9000]] teenagers [[An Hero|committed suicide]], because of the intensive whining from Chester Bennington and the band's decision to throw a few [[Fuck|f-bombs]] on the album to [[lie|"be cool"]]. Turns out, the leaked album was from a [[England|Eurofag]] rap metal group, Tribal Ink. Compared to the faggy and watered-down songs of MTM, Tribal Ink was actually [[True|better]] than that of Linkin Park's.

The band told everyone on the [[internet]]z that this album was going to be their movement towards "[[Tool|progressive rock]]". While this album was different because of their new producer Rick Rubin ([[moar]] like Jewbin, [[amirite]]?), he used his money making formula to make Linkin Park as [[emo]] as they were originally, by simply not letting Shinoda do his [[hip-hop]] thing because Rick thought he was still involved with Fort Minor. The lead single from the album, [[rape|"What I've Done"]] was used for the ending of the Transformers movie, thus [[FGSFDS|ruining the entire movie]]. This of course then made it the default song for all Transformers [[Youtube|Jewtube]] tributes.

== Hands Held High ==
"An asinine anti-Bush diatribe on which multi-millionaire Mike Shinoda seethes that folk can’t afford gas no more." 

This was the song description according to Dan, a music critic, that gave a low score to the new album. Some faggot couldn't stand this and immediately made a response:

{{quote|WTF!!!! f*** u DAN
u dont even seem like knowing what ur talkin about, or plz make sure u heard the right album!!! it shows that u hate linkin park, but u shouldn't let ur feelings blind the common sense witch is missing in ur review for SURE!!! Critics should be ashamed u being one of them, if u donâ€™t like the album u must at least have some decency or even some taste in music not to attack them that way,

linkin park:
great band
great album
5 stars
lp for life..

dan silver:
â€œa bad critic who should be fired for speaking non sense|typical 12-year-old fan}}

=A Thousand Suns=
 [[File:Linkin_Park_-_A_thousand_suns.jpg|thumb|right|[[Goatse]] + [[Lens Flare]] = A Thousand [[Cock|Suns]]]]
Late 2010, Linkin Park released a new album titled [[Shit Nobody Cares About|"A Thousand Suns" or just "Thousand Suns"]]. To half of LP fags, it gave them butthurt due to the large amount of swearing and assness of each track. Half the album is 30 second to 1 minute tracks and almost all of them are daisy chained together sounding like one fucking track. To the other half, they remained the cock sucking zombies they are, ate the shit, and smiled. But hey, [[Wigger|the rapping is back]]. In track "Blackout" Chester channels his inner [[Ke$ha]] and raps like he's on gunpoint. Shinoda's no better, as he channels [[T-Pain]] and robotically mutters random words from an [[Ayn Rand]] book and saying NOOOOOO at the end of each verse

While LP used to be called their own genre, and this album sounds like EVERY genre. Electronic, reggae, rock, rap, [[Azn|Balinese]], porno soundtrack, and more. And you know it's bad when you watch a long time LP fan listen to one track and pop the disc out. Then proceeding to piss, shit, and vomit on it.

The album cover looks something like if you took [[Goatse|Goatse]] and applied [[Lens Flare|Lens Flare]] to it.

Linkin Park's "A Thousand Suns" = [[Insane Clown Posse]] 2: [[Electric Boogaloo]].

Oh when they come for me, I'll be gone|Next hit of 2011}}


==Linkin Park Underground 8==
[[Image:LinkinPark8.jpg|thumb|right|Unsurprisingly, Linkin Park's most controversial album.]]
[[Image:Linkinpark.jpg|thumb]]
In late 2008 the band had become indignant over growing outcry from their [[weeaboos|exclusive fanclub]] that people were [[Bernie Madoff|paying $40 a year to get an exclusive]] CD that contained live versions of the same 8 songs for about six years, a plan was hatched, and so '''Linkin Park Underground 8: [[Homosexual|MMM...COOKIES - Sweet Hamster Like Jewels From America!]]''' was released; filled with songs such as'' Bubbles'' and ''PB N' Jellyfish''. 

While the album itself was as [[unfunny|funny]] as expected, the real fun came in inciting their [[asspie|emotional fanbase]]. Emos and weeaboos cried greasy tears of indignation across the internet, enraged that their beloved band had [[John Solomon#The Broken Mirror|played them fine]]. With that, Linkin Park joined the ranks of many other bands that have [[Trent Reznor|trolled their fans due to their own butthurt]], making it the first time in years that they had done anything remotely entertaining. 

<center><youtube>VC5FfZstBIc</youtube></center>

And then in one of the most pathetic examples of [[Troll's Remorse]] in years, Mike Shinoda pussed out and apologized for the album about 2 hours later on his blog.

{{quote|I’m going to post something on my blog as soon as I can wrap my head around the stuff going on regarding the new LPU CD “MMM…Cookies.” This new LPU CD was intended to be something fun that we could all enjoy: a lighter CD of music, meant to be silly.

Although some people think the CD is great (I think it’s hilarious), I have read some comments on the LPUMB that said they felt like we were “slapping the fans in the face” with this CD. For any of you who think we “did this as a fuck you to the fans,” I can wholeheartedly assure you that there is absolutely no scenario where that would ever be the case. In our minds, you would laugh with us about this CD in the same way that you laugh with the funniest moments of LPTV or the “Frat Party” DVD. Some of you responded this way to the CD, and some did not.

I’ll address it later. But for now, I want to assure you that our only intention with the LPU CD, as with all our fan club endeavors, is to create a fan club that you can enjoy and is worth your time. If anyone was let down by the CD, I sincerely apologize.|Mike Shinoda, selling out as usual.}}

They then turned around and made another shitty Transformers themesong.

In their latest round of faggotry, they have licensed some of their shit to [[Medal of Honor]]. Its meant to boost morale of American gunfodder. For an additional 9 grand, they would also license their shit to the Taliban but poor Taliban no Amrican dollor no afford.


== Linkin Park 8-Bit Rebellion ==
The band released an iPhone game called 8-Bit Rebellion. This is actually the new album for 2010.

{{quote|Its pretty cool. You play as the band members and shoot enemies. If you beat the game, you unlock a new song! Its pretty cool! Not selling out. Now go and buy it!|Mike Shinoda}}

{{quote|woohooo! I always wanted to play as my favorite band lip syncing to their music live! Is there a cock sucking mini-game? This is a dream come true!|A true Linkin Park fan}}

==Linkin Park Fans==
[[you|Linkin Park fans]] are of course the faggiest among [[faggotry]]. They are often just 13 year old boys or [[emo]] girls who live in the suburbs [[BAWWWWW|complaining]] about how their [[Shit nobody cares about|parents treat them unfairly and their life is horrible]]. And of course we all know having a horrible life ONLY MEANS that you have parents that don't constantly give you everything you want and makes you do homework? Each one of them plays the "my opinion card."
