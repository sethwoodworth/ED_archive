Rachel Bruno, aka "Nasty Rachel," (now 25 yo) is the granddaughter of State Senate Majority Leader [[republican|Joseph Bruno]].  She was reported missing back at the end of July, 2006 when she'd failed to show up for work at a day care center.  She was found wandering Times Square on August 2nd, approximately a week later, and was returned to her parents custody.  It was later reported that she was supposedly kidnapped by some greasy fuck she met on [[MySpace]] and a great deal of attention was given to her "kidnapping".

All this would have remained just another [[shit nobody cares about|meaningless]] blurb in [[old media|the news]] had footage of her "[[scat|activities]]" with one of her captors not popped up on the [[interbutts]].  Rachel was essentially a neglected, anorexic, and troubled young [[gullible|white girl]] with political connections who was pimped out/coerced into sexual relations by [[Nigra|John "Jazzo" Savage]] - the 30 yo captor/drug dealer/pimp she met through [[MySpace]].  

As it turns out her "captor" was [[OMG|black!]] and not surprisingly the media gave a [[Missing white woman syndrome|great amount of attention to her story]] during, and following, that entire week.  Somehow details have remained sketchy on what, if anything at all, John Savage was charged with following her return (other than the outstanding charges he had from ''previous'' crimes).   

==John Savage==

John Savage's Myspace page was essentially an over-the-top and less than subtle method for him to elicit young girls for IRL prostitution. (Unfortunately, the page has since been deleted)  

{{quote|My name is Jazzo and my interests in myspace is to meet [[loli|beautiful young women]] that want to travel and [[rape|get down wit a playa]].| [http://capitalregionpeople.blogspot.com/2006/08/rachel-bruno-found-just-in-time.html John Savage], a quote from his now deleted Myspace}}

==Senator Joseph Bruno's Reaction==
[[Image:Joseph-Bruno.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Senator Joseph Bruno: clueless]]
A quote from the a NYTimes article following the "kidapping" sums up Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno's thoughts:  
{{quote|1=At a news conference in Albany, Mr. Bruno said that his granddaughter had an eating disorder and emotional problems and that she had left her upstate home after meeting a man on the Internet, an encounter that [[O RLY|may have put her in danger]]."|2=From [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/nyregion/03bruno.html?_r=1&oref=slogin The NYTimes article]}}


==The Outcome==
[[Image:Rachel Bruno comparison.gif|right|200px]]

Rachel got access to Savage's cellphone during the "kidnapping" and [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/congress/index.html?query=BRUNO,%20RACHEL&field=per&match=exact called home] on August 1st to talk to her parents, only a day before she was found walking through [[New York|Times Square]].  Unfortunately for Savage the police and feds traced the call and promptly [[partyvan|apprehended]] him not long after she returned.  It still remains to be seen whether Savage was, in fact, actually charged with anything, other than the outstanding charges he had from ''before'' the kidnapping.

As to the reason(s) Rachel decided to hook up with some creepy [[nigra]] on the internet in the first place...well no one really knows.  But if her [[Myspace]] still exists, Anon has yet to find it.  The issue of whether Rachel was, in fact, a true victim of [[raep]], or whether she was simply a naive young woman whom was exploited and degraded by some [[sick fuck]]s she met online, [[shit nobody cares about|has continued to be a point of controversy]] for anons who have discovered the truth about her.

Incidentally, as a very late reaction to what happened, on February 4th, 2008, Senator Joseph Bruno announced his intentions to [http://www.senatorbruno.com/43/news/08-02-04/bruno_joins_ag_speaker_to_crack_down_on_sexual_predators_on_the_internet.aspx "crack down on sexual predators on the internet"].

==Anon Copypasta==

<pre>
she is actually being tortured.
this chick was kidnapped (from my town) maybe a year or two ago. she was found on 
the streets of NYC when this guy had had enough fun with her. she's the neice of 
Joe Bruno (a google search will net you a couple pics of her, i'm sure) you can 
see all her pics (and a video, where she's repeatedly crying while getting ATM'd)
it's a torrent named 'Nasty Rachel'
so... it's kinda not cool.
but once you know it's an actual kidnap and forced degradation... well... it's a little like a 
car accident, ya know? can't look away?
wtf ever
