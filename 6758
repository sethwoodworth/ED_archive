Furthermore, [http://robblecopter.ytmnd.com robblecopter].  A roflcopter is not only a new inventive way for nubz to "roll on the floor laughing" while not moving their ass out of their damn chairs, but also a new form of flight.  [[some argue|It has often been argued]] that rolling on the floor laughing will not in fact make you fly, but keep dreaming you [[fat]] fucks.

[[Unfunny|The ROFLcopter is an important part of the defense of LOLrville. Along with the LMAOplane, TTYLnukes, and Anons armed with AFK47s and MMK16s, the ROFLcopter is used as a mobile troop carrier and anti-Tankcat weapons platform.]]

==Wannameme==
A [[meme]] was started [[last thursday]] when some [[User:Whittsnake|guy]]s started making jokes about ROFL Clapton, the singer of hit single Sunshine of Your LOL!

Most people not from the internet don't know about the roflcopter:
<pre>
Myself: roflcopter
Other:  what......? WTF?
Myself: don't worry about it
Other:  like... spinning on the floor?????
Myself: you can't comprehend the roflcopter
Myself: your feeble psyche would shatter under the weight of such a revelation
Other:  it sounds like you spinning on the floor you like having sex 
Myself: it's not
Myself: stop saying that

== World of Warcraft ==
"Roflcopter" is not a legal name on [[World of Warcraft]], and anybody using it runs the risk of being suspended for doing so. It is also the pet name for the copter that only engineers can make.

==Game==
[[Runescape|Apparently, some luser(s) actually made a flash game, with state-of-the-art ASCII graphics, a whopping two colors, and really shitty background music]] [http://www.rofl.name/roflcopter/]. The only reason anybody plays this game is it is the first thing that pops up on [[Google]]. [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=roflcopter&btnG=Google+Search]. It is suspected that the high score list is entirely populated by [[furries]] and/or [[16-year-old girl]]s.

== Sex ==

"Roflcopter" is a deadly awesome way to perform sex. So awesome, it can only be learned through [[oral argument]]ing.

== Sound ==
The "Roflcopter" was believed at first to be the sound of some fat kid laying on the floor rotating in circles laughing, Upon further research it is found that said object makes a Beeping sound, reminicant to a alarm. As demonstrated with "Beep,Beep ,Beep,Beep, Beep"

==ROFLCOPTER and Death==
It has been estimated that the Roflcopter has been the cause of [[over 9000]] deaths of cameljockeys and niggers. The "soi soi soi soi soi" sound the Roflcopter makes you shit yourself like [[tubgirl]] and [[fap]] to [[loli]] for 14 years until your genitals fall off.
