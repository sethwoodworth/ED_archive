[[Image:Recent changes patrol.jpg|thumb|The RCP in action.]]
'''Recent changes patrol''' is a purely voluntary form of [[BDSM|indentured servitude]] that many free [[Wikipedia]] editors with [[self esteem]] issues and [[so ronery|no life]] all [[:Image:aspirations.jpg|ASPIRE]] to and will willingly [[hooker|subjugate themselves]] to on a daily basis just to keep [[in the ass|in the good books]] of [[Jimbo]] and his team of pedo[[fap|hand-picked]] [[Wikipedo]] '''[[autism|'A Team']]'''. Users like Muzemike, Rodhullandemu, j.delanoy really enjoy patrollin wikipedia because jewbo gives them extra pedo banging at wikimanias, that's why they look like total crap. This in the quest for the Holy Grail of TOW: being an [[admin]]—something resembling the 'power' and control over their peers that they lack in their daily lives. In reality, however, being an [[op]] at a poorly sourced and erroneous <s>encyclopedia</s> <s>catalogue</s> huge stinking pile of misinformation is about as much of an honour as being the towel and lube flunky on a [[pr0n]] shoot.

For that matter, RC patrol [[Cancer|transcends TOW]] and is existent on many other wikis such as [[Wikia]] and [[Uncyclopedia]] (where RC patrolling is redundant since even the lamest vandal at Uncy is funnier than the contributors). While the need for it could virtually be eliminated by [[banhammer|simple measures]], the higher ups of those wikis are fucking [[retards]] and allow anyone to [[Raep|edit]] [[anonymous]]ly.

==[[Final Solution|Urban Rose Quits]]==
[[Image:Urban Rose.jpg|thumb|WTF is a [[trap|chick]] this hot doing on TOW to begin with?]]
[[Image:Urbanrosebbq.jpg|thumb|right|Urban Rose surrounded by Wiki Jew penises. Can ED save her?]]
After the [[Grawp]] trollfest on TOW, RC patroller [[Wikipedia:User:Urban Rose|Urban Rose]] become disillusioned with "the project."  Out of frustration from their general faggotry, UR made an account on [[ED]] and posted the following on [[User:UR|her user page]]:

{{tinyquote|I go by "Urban Rose" on TOW. Or at least I did until I realized how ridiculous it is what [[wikipedos|average people]] have to go through just to keep the site functioning because of the policies that have been set in place by [[bureaucratic fucks|those in change]]

[[USI|I've decided that what Wikipedia should do]] if it ever decides that it wants its legitimate contributors to be treated with respect is require account creation ''and'' an email address (for that matter, this site should to, but that's a different story). This would not deter legitimate contributors and would virtually eliminate petty vandalism and sockpuppetry.

It would possibly mean fewer passing by typo corrections, but it's my bet that [[shit nobody cares about|the majority of Wikipedia's articles]] are written almost entirely by a few [[basement dwellers|dedicated editors]]. This idea that good articles arise from many contributors adding small amounts of information at a time is false. [[Dubious Disclaimer|I can't prove this unfortunately]], but if I were to look at statistics, I strongly bet that I would find this to be correct. That said, I've come to feel that even editing this site is [[you are doing it wrong|a better use of my time]] than reverting [[trolls|graffiti]] by [[EDiots|school kids]] and tagging [[Blu Aardvark|sockpuppets of autistic sockpuppeteers]] for hours on end.

Once [[Jimbo Wales|the administration]] decides to implement these changes (require account creation and an email address), I just might return, but my days of being a [[slave]] to the [[penis|rollback button]] are over. Who knows, perhaps I just might become a legitimate contributor to this site (not likely, but who knows). Internet culture [[NORP|isn't really my thing]], but this site could serve as [[attack site|a medium]] through which I constructively [[Troll|make my views known to]] [[TOW|the world]].|Urban Rose}}

==Trolling==
[[Image:Asda-roll-back.jpg|thumb|The benefits of rollback are well known to all.]]

UR then created the page that you are reading right now, to troll the douchebags on the Recent Changes Patrol, causing much [[butthurt]] and wiki[[drama]].

{{squote|I'm thinking of writing an article called "RC patrol". But I have other things to do so I doubt I'll end up becoming a full time contributor to [[ED|this site]]. I may occasionally add opinions to Wikipedia-related articles but as a whole writing about internet culture is not my thing. I'm contributing more to [[troll|make a point]] on Wikipedia.|Urban Rose, shortly before creating this article}}

She also attempted to start a deletion review of the ED page on TOW (which according to Wikipedia doesn't exist) just to spite them, in particular user [[Sceptre]].

==Reaction==
[[Image:Urbanroseanime.jpg|thumb|[[Face of the Future|UR anime]]]]

Needless to say, Sceptre [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2008_May_3&diff=209980693&oldid=209980219 closed it] and appealed to his sysop friends to have Urban Rose b& for being disruptive.  As if that wasnt enough he also got [[personal army|a bunch of faggots]] to spam her talk page. 

After she was banned, users finally started to question Sceptres' [[bullshit]].  As a result he had his rollback privileges and his access revoked, making him look like an even bigger asshat (if that's possible).
<br>

<blockquote>00:33, 5 May 2008 AuburnPilot (Talk | contribs) changed rights for User:Sceptre from rollbacker to (none) ‎ (Per discussion on WP:AN; abuse</blockquote>

<blockquote>Per Sceptre's abuse of the rollback function, and the concerns noted above, I have revoked his access. - auburnpilot talk 00:34, 5 May 2008 (UTC)<br>
*[[Butthurt|RickK would've loved you.]] Sceptre (talk) 00:43, 5 May 2008 (UTC)</blockquote>
<br>

Because he totally wasn't butthurt or anything, Sceptre then blanked both his user and talk pages, committing Wikicide.  [[User:Die clown die|Many have tried]] but Urban Rose was the only one successful in ridding the internets of Sceptre and his faggotry.

==Successful Troll is Successful==
[[Image:Urbanrose cunt.jpg|thumb|Rule 34 satisfied!]]
As a result, Urban Rose has become somewhat of an icon on ED, and she will probably go down in history as the most attractive person to successfully troll TOW.  
{{quote|'''I've been getting requests for [[34|tit pics]] and stuff like that.'''|Urban Rose}}

{{quote|'''If by <i>"stuff like that"</i> you mean shaved vagoo pix...then put me on the request list.'''|[[ODB]]}}

{{quote|'''I'd hit hit.'''|[[User:Chunkmunky|Chunkmunky]]}}

UR is currently working to get an ED article at TOW, or at least getting ED mentioned in other relevant articles.
