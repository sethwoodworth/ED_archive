The Bloody Board
{{needsmore|screencaps of Jamie talking to herself}}

[[File:Jamie Marsters.jpg|thumb|Which one the fuck she is?]]

'''The Bloody Board''' is one of many forums dedicated to the TV series [[Vampires|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]. Unlike all other forums on the internet there was no drama whatsoever. None. Normally this would make it one of the most boring if not unique forums in the world. Yet hidden within the as-boring-as-a-rock Bloody Board was a small shining gem of [[lulz]].

==Jamie Marsters==
[[File:jamie_marsters_profile.png|thumb|Oh shit, she's online.  WHAT DO WE DO?]]

'''Jamie Marsters''' ([[Powerword]]: Louisa Pearce) is a [[batshit insane]], [[aspie]] from [[Australia]], who devoted her life to obsessively posting info about Buffy The Vampire Slayer on an internet message board named The [[period|Bloody]] Board. Like many girls she obsessed over [[Twilight|sexy vampires]] and soon the forum was flooded with her messages.

All <big>'''37,650'''</big> of them.

So far she sounds like one especially [[batshit insane]] fangirl, yet nobody has called her out on her faggotry. This is because Jamie is the one and only member. The Bloody Board consists entirely of Jamie Marsters creating threads and replying to herself, over and over again. The board itself was founded in [[2004]], meaning that as of [[2010]] Jamie has been furiously talking to herself and masturbating to Buffy like a paranoid schizophrenic for whole ''Six. Fucking. Years''. It was only a matter of time until [[Cracked|somebody noticed]].

Being offline since the time of the Cracked article, little did she know that when she came back her quaint little Buffy fanforum would not be how she left it.

==The Discovery==

On October 26th 2010, [[goatse|Crack]]ed magazine writers Nick [[vampire|Coffin]] and Derek James wrote an article entitled [http://www.cracked.com/article_18792_the-7-most-unintentionally-creepy-places-internet.html "The 7 Most Unintentionally Creepy Places on the Internet"]. While most of the places were fairly creepy, the coverage of "The Bloody Board" was like a glance into a [[goatse|deep, dark, soul clutching abyss]].
While [[NORPs|most Cracked readers]] were [[shocked and appalled]], some [[anon|other readers]] immediately recognized the huge potential for [[hookers and blow|lulz and drama]], and posted it on [[b]], who unanimously decided to offer the poor lonely girl some [[troll|company]]. Thus the '''Bloody Board''' was soon raided by the bloody bored.

<big>'''Fun Facts:'''</big><br />
Close observations of this board show:

*Further proof of her increasingly rotting mind, almost all of Jamie's posts and messages are not about Buffy, but about herself.
*Many of the threads are [[TL;DR|damn fucking long]]. This actually becomes scary when you realise [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:bYxriR6TXk8J:dontkillspike.proboards.com/index.cgi%3Fboard%3Dgeneral%26action%3Ddisplay%26thread%3D4376+http://dontkillspike.proboards.com/index.cgi%3Fboard%3Dgeneral%26action%3Ddisplay%26thread%3D4376&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk this thread] has 187 replies and [[over 9000|8,744 views]].
*According to her profile she is 27 (meaning she was 21 when her board began), making her obsession all the more creepy.
*It is a well known [[fact]] that the present of Jamie Marsters is the future of any [[Twilight]] fangirl. You have been warned.


===Storming The Bloody Shores===
[[File:Leave-Jamie-Marsters-ALONE.jpg|thumb|Some butthurt white knight.]]

Within a few hours, her message board was savagely [[rape|raped]], brutalized and torn apart by the [[Internet Hate Machine]], and her [[Powerword]] and [http://www.facebook.com/louisa.pearce1?v=wall#!/louisa.pearce1 Fapbook page] [[internet detective|detected]]. The Hive spared no souls on this one; mainly because she [[aspie|dosen't have one]].

However, not everyone harried to smite the poor girl. Some virgin basement-dwelling [[White Knights]] recognized a potential [[buttsex|relationship]] in Jamie, due to the fact that she probably is the only female pathetic and lonely enough to even look at them. They quickly rushed to yell "[[leave britney alone|LEAVE JAMIE ALONE!!111]], which only increased the lulz, with maximum lulz produced when some butthurt cunt claimed to be Jamie's sister and started [[BAW|BAWWWing]] about some people having fun. Party pooper.

===A NEW CHALLENGER APPEARS!===
[[File:Logan_vaughn.jpg|thumb|The face of justice.]]

{{squote|Your not funny, harrasing a poor girl who hasn't done anything wrong. This isn't entertainment. I'm The Dark Eric Draven, and I'm proudly telling you to fuck off. For real this time. Leave. Her. Alone.|Proudly told to fuck off 5 seconds later, my [[MysteryBot]].}}

At some point, someone with apparently good intentions came around and started begging everyone to stop in an obviously butthurt way. Said user went by the name [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&biw=1680&bih=870&q=thedarkericdraven&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai= TheDarkEricDraven] and soon enough a [http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001241864372&v=info facebook page] was found (Just face it, Logan.  You can never open that account again). Apparently this outstanding citizen goes by the name Logan Vaughn and is quite the prince charming. [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=The_Bloody_Board&diff=1998622598&oldid=1998622519 He even tried to blank the page once, oh how valiant!]

===This is the End...===

At 4:00PM PST, reports started pouring in that Jamie was now online, and indeed she was. Things had died down considerably by this time and only a few [[loser|diehard trolls]] remained. They began questioning whether Jamie was a bot after there were no signs of life coming from the account. Roughly 45 minutes later, in the sheer horror of [[rape|having her lonely, lonely board suddenly flooded by trolls,]] she began banning accounts. One of the users had made an alternate account earlier and managed to log on via proxy and warn his fellow trolls, but the message came too late.

At around 4:50PM PST,10/26/2010, after 6 whole years of talking to herself, Jamie Marsters [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|removed the Bloody Board from the internets.]]

As for Cracked.com itself, it members were horrified by the sheer level of douchebaggery on the internet, more shocked by the trolls which invaded Jamie's forum than a creepy pedophile who also appeared on the same list.
Update: An anon contacted the authors of the article, including a link to this page. Apparently there was only [[butthurt]] among the [[Cracked]] peons. 
 Here is his response:

Interestingly another person who appeared on the list was a psychotic fan who had written literally thousands of songs for P Diddy. [[It is a mystery|For some reason]] this guy is considered crazy, but [[sarcasm|poor little Jamie]] isn't.

==Shit was So Cached...==
Sadly despite the site's long history, it was shut down as soon as the [[b|/b/tards]] began flooding the page like a blocked toilet before any of the [[lulz]] of her many threads and messages could be screencaped. However thanks to the power of [[Google]] all is not lost:

#[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_FNADssWnNsJ:dontkillspike.proboards.com/+the+bloody+board&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk Here is the cached board]
#Click on a link. You will get a message saying the page is not available.
#Copy the URL.
#Paste the URL into [[Google]].
#You will get a result from The Bloody Board.
#Click on "cached".
#????
#[[PROFIT]]

<small>NOTE: You will have to copy steps 2 - 6 several times if you want to get to an individual thread.</small>
