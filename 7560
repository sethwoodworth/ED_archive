A '''Skullworm''' is a life form which thrives in the heads of all [[internets]] users starting as [[OL]] internet [[virus]] worms and transgressing to [[IRL]] when one [[crossmack|connects to the internet with their mind]]. 

The internet users mind is a particularly suitable habitat for skullworms as [[no one]] ever sees the faces of these ugly internet dwellers and [[nobody]] sees the rapid decay in skull flesh. Thusly they are nourished with all the brains required to keep your Skullworms healthy.

==Habitat==
Skullworms prefer soft inactive brains. You won't be able to grow happy Skullworms, unless you follow a few simple rules:

*Play [[WoW]] as often as you can... as long as you can.
*Eat at [[Mcdonalds]] or [[KFC]].
*Use mobile phones.
*Get [[Skullfuck|skullfucked]]. 
*Don't clean your ears. 
*Read [[moar]] [[Encyclopedia_Dramatica|ED]]


Skullworms are used in the movie "Beastmaster". However, their fictional counterparts are green, not white.
