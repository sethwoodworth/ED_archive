'''''Rozen Maiden''''' is one of the more up-and-coming [[anime]] series out there, meaning that it features [[not4chan|lolicon]], [[incest]], and robots. For extra [[lulz]], they decided to combine the [[pedophilia]] and robots by having the main human character, Jun, in love or something with his walking, talking, [[hate]]ful [[dyke]] of a [[doll]] named Shinku. The real reason for its popularity, though, is that the main character is a [[basement dweller|shut-in social reject]], much like all [[anime]] fans, and thus serves as a convenient method of [[Otherkin|living vicariously]] through [[You|someone who isn't real]]. Naturally, there's a real girl with a crush on him, Cameltomoe, or Clitorsu or [[shit_nobody_cares_about|some shit]], but Jun prefers his little [[Dollfie|pedo-doll]], who regularly beats him, srsly. Throw in a sister, who it reveals in one episode has a thing for him, and this series more than meets your daily requirement of [[sick fuck|sick fuckery]]! ~[[desu|desudesudesu]]~
Also good to know, the Japanese level of this show is [[OVER 9000]], your head may explode simply by watching, because if you're an English speaker, the Japaneseness will cause you to go insane.  

==Rating==
[[Image:HinaIchigoPr0nz.png|thumb|[[OMG]], Doll Porn.]]
*'''''Action''': 7.'' This show is about dolls beating the shit out of each other so there are actually some [[retarded|cool]] fight scenes on occasion, but lots of [[shit|shitty]], [[gay]] "[[shit|funnay]]" episodes, too.  For the fight scenes, try to imagine Barbies hitting each other with flak cannons while crying about why their father doesn't love them.
*'''''Lulz''': 4.'' Tries to be funny, fails frequently. The character Kanaria is one of the most painful things to watch ever.  Also, needs more [[desu]].
*'''''[[pedobear|Paedophilia]]''': 9.'' Doesn't have actual [[sex]], but it does have the dolls strip on occasion and there's no doubt Jun and Shinku have some creepy pseudo-romance going on.  Also, Jun's sister totally wants to [[buttsex|bend him over his sewing table]] and [[rape|J-J-J-JAM IT IN]].
*'''''Muzak''': 4.''  The soundtrack gets repetitive about four minutes into the first episode.  Guess the [[douchebag]]s who created this show couldn’t afford more than three songs. There’s the generic [[shit|UBER]] ROCK song, the [[shit|UBER]] [[Seinfeld|BASS RIFF]] drum song, the [[shit|UBER]] [[kawaii|KAWAII]] battle song, and the OMG SOO [[kawaii|KAWAII]] cutesy song, OH and all that [[old|Victorian]] style [[shit|music]] [[shit nobody cares about|which is VITAL to the show]], all of which will melt the average [[b/tard|b/tard's]] brainmeats with their sheer awfulness (This may be a blessing in disguise, as long as you aren't watching it also).

==Characters==
===Dolls===
[[Image:Dolls on steroids2.jpg|center|Dolls on Steroids]]
[[Image:Suiseiseki Chibi Human.png|thumb|Suiseiseki is full of [[Unwarranted self-importance]]]]
[[Image:Lulz0003.jpg|thumb|ZOMG [[Card Crusher|BROOCHCRUSH'D]]]]

Due to loose character development, not much is known about the mysterious ''Rozen Maiden'' dolls.  What quickly becomes obvious, however, is that all of them have about as many social skills as the average [[b|/b/tard]], which is usually enough to keep the [[lulz]] coming from one episode to the next.  Apart from being socially inept in the "raised by wolves" way, it is known that they are [[Unwarranted self-importance|narcissistic]] little bitches that you'd probably want to smack halfway across the [[internet]] if it they weren't so... [[Dolljoints|strangely arousing]].

*'''Suigintou''' - aka Junk. Vengeful [[goth]] bitch with wings that turn into machine guns. Also, [[cripple|LOL NO ABDOMEN]].  Because the [[Nazi]] who created her forgot to give her a waistline (not to mention [[boobs]]), she decides to [[butthurt|take it out on the world]]. Instead of [[bawwwww|crying]] on LJ and masturbating on MSN with a cucumber, she throws shittons of feathers at her 300-year-old [[loli]] sisters, and rips the soul right out of [[At least 100|at least one]] of them.  Hates the shit out of her sister Shinku for having a more successful career as a [[camwhore]].  Dies several times, but [[Jesus|won't fucking stay down]].  An avid fan of [[WHEN I WAS|MCR]].
*'''Kanaria''' - aka [[Canada|Kanada]]. Crazy bitch with a violin and an umbrella and yellow puffy pants, WHAT THE HELL. NOBODY EXCEPT [[Faggot|LIBERACE]] WEARS SHIT LIKE THAT.  Has an [[Robotnik|egg fetish.]] Spends her time getting beat up by crows for her lunch, and getting [[molest|molested]] by the even crazier bitch she rooms with.
*'''Suiseiseki''' - [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[Shit nobody cares about|DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[Cock|DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]] [[DESU]]
*'''[[boku|Souseiseki]]''' - aka [[Boku]]. Desu's [[IT'S A TRAP|trap]] [[twincest|twin]] sister.  Hangs out with one of the guys from [[lemonparty]] most of the time, and lives in the shadow of her more popular [[meme|sister]].  Has a devoted following among [[dickgirl]] fans worldwide.  In the anime, she flips out after eating a bad burrito and gets her soul ripped out [[Guro|Temple of Doom]] style.  WHOOPS LOL ¯\(°_o)/¯. She has been described as masculine, however weeaboo's often forget that she's skinny as a rat.
*'''Shinku''' - aka Teabitch. Cranky, [[Brit|British]] bitch dressed in red who beats the shit out of her [[emo]] [[basement dweller|hikikomori]] servant for [[lulz]], especially if her tea is late.  In her spare time, she moonlights as a [[Goddessmine|financial dominatrix]] and [[animu|puppet-show]] [[fangirl]](????), maxing out Jun's credit card just about every month with her [[weeaboo]] purchases.  Hates the shit out of her sister Suigintou for [[Card Crusher|crushing]] the precious [[Bling bling|brooch]] her sugardaddy gave her. FUCKING DIES (but gets better afterwards). Hates [[cats]]. [[Image:Catsaretheenemy.jpg|thumb|Teabitch [[RAGE|hates cats.]]]]
*'''Hinaichigo''' - aka Nano, because of her [[nanomachines]]. [[gay|Pink-clad]] [[kawaii|OMGKAWAII]] lolidoll with what seems to be an eating disorder.  Also one of the most annoying of all the dolls, but that's ok because she's also the [[loli]], which makes you want to fap to her, doesn't it, you [[sick fuck]].  Tastes like strawberries, especially when [[cum|watered]].  Also notable for dying in sick, twisted ways.
*'''Barasuishou''' - A [[pirate]] that somehow found her way into the show after being created by two gay lovers.  Doesn't say much, because her agent couldn't actually get her a part with more than three lines per season.  She does manage to [[School Shooting|kill everybody]], which is kind of cool.  Of course, she immediately fucks it up by CRUMBLING INTO A WEEPY PILE OF CEMENT LIKE A LITTLE PUSSY, which pretty much labels her as epic [[fail]].
*'''Kirakishou''' - Another pirate, but wears her eye patch on the other side. Likes strawberries, bananas and [[vore|cannibalism]].  Not to be confused with that guy from [[Death Note]].  Doesn't say anything at all, ever, seeing as she has an even shittier agent than Barasuishou.

===Humans===
Huh? what? there are humans on this show?
*'''Jun''' - Started all this shit by finding Shinku and trying to [[buttsex]] her. Became an emo bitch after getting made fun of at school for being a [[lolicon]]. Gets kicked in the shins a lot.  Later on in the series, he buys a gun and climbs up to the top of the school tower trying to beat [[Cho]]'s high score.
*'''Nori''' - Jun's sister. Dreams of [[incest|WINcest]] with her little brother, among other people and objects. She plays lacrosse, a game intended to turn women into [[lesbian]]s. [[pokemon|It's super effective!]]
*'''Kashiwaba Tomoe''' - Jun's creepy [[jailbait]] stalker, whom he constantly rejects due to not having [[dolljoints]]. Was abducted by Hinaichigo as a young girl and forced to endure days of torture in one of those [[Japan|Japanese]] [[Hello Kitty]] [[BDSM]] rooms.
*'''Rozen''' - This is the story, of a man named Rozen, who created seven psycho little dolls. Even when apart from him, the dolls still scream his name every night. He is a known [[Nazi]], and almost certainly a raging [[pedophile]].
*'''Enju''' - Remedial student in Rozen's Dollsexing 101 for Dummies. Turns out to be homocidally jealous of Rozen for making nicer doll clothes than him.  Created Barasuishou and most likely [[Pedobear]].
*'''Laplace''' - Enju's gay [[furfag]] lover, turns into a giant rabbit when he clicks his heels three times. Oh and he's [[My Immortal|immortal]] and omniscient or some shit.

==Fandom==

===The cosplay===
Because the [[Wapanese|Japanese]] are obsessed with everything they see on TV, it is obligatory for them to dress up as their favourite [[animu|cartoon]] heroes, Rozen Maiden being no exception.  In fact, a law was recently passed in [[Japan|Moonland]] to make it illegal for people ''not'' to cosplay.  All of this means, of course, that you can expect a shitload of ugly, [[ugly]] people wearing shit costumes anywhere you go, especially in America, where being ugly and overweight is a prerequisite for being a Japan-loving [[Weeaboo]].

===The drama===
Rozen Maiden came out as a [[comic|manga]] in September 2002, first appearing in a [[shit|non-notable]] magazine on [[Japan|the Moon]] called ''Comic Birz'', which was staffed with [[retard]]s and [[furry|fuckups]].  After many years of doodling [[loli]]s with [[dolljoints]], the authors decided that the time was right to make a [[anime|cartoon]] out of this shit, and so work began on what was to become the most loved [[b|/b/]] meme of all time.  In due time, the animu was released, and elevens everywhere (including some high-profile government officials) fapped their hearts out with joy.  Somewhere in [[America|the real world]], [[Anonymous|someone]] noticed what was going on and realized that [[4chan|the internets]] needed to know about this wonderful development, and thus, through the magic of [[MS Paint]], [[DESU]] was born.

Then suddenly, late one evening in [[Last Thursday|early 2007]], [[lulz|disaster]] struck when the editorial department of [[Blockatiel|Birds]] Comics got absolutely shitfaced drunk and [[piss|pissed]] all over the latest ''Rozen Maiden'' chapter they were supposed to run in their next issue.  To try to cover up their [[Epic Fail|epic failure]], they ran an old copy of [[Naruto]] instead. Remarkably, nobody seemed to notice until someone pointed out that Sasukeseki wasn't saying DESU as much as he usually did.  [[Shit]] hit the fan, [[Serious Business|lawsuits]] were filed, and the crowd of [[pedo]]s on [[Desuchan]] wailed at the prospect of losing their main source of [[dolljoints|dollicon]].  The fail became even more epic when the authors of ''Rozen Maiden'' announced they would be [[drama|severing their contract]] with [[Burger King|Burger Comics]], thus throwing the fate of the series in doubt and unleashing wave after wave of [[bawwwww]] from despondent [[weeaboos]].  To make things worse, the [[Japanese|Elevens]] canceled North American sales of the Animu DVDs, shattering dreams of the coveted Season Three everywhere.

As of July 2nd, 2008, the cunts responsible for putting the [[OVER 9000]] line in the [[Dragon Ball Z]] series have announced that they rescued the ''Rozen Maiden'' series for release in North America, in addition to the countless [[lolicon]] titles that had been lost due to the aforementioned epic fail of 2007. Throughout the [[4th of July]] holiday weekend of 2008, the joyous cheers of weeaboos, /b/tards, dollicons, lolicons and pedophiles could be heard all over the world.

==The Manga==
Once every 100 years, Peach-Pitt puts out a new tale, just to give false hope to [[desuchan|dollfags]] that the [[Anime]] will be revived.
