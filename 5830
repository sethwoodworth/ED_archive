[[Image:NDWarmDay.jpg|thumb|right|Staring at the wind-polished snow dunes in the middle of April, one imagines that [[liberal]] jiggaboo [[Al Gore]] discovered global warming on a [[jenkem]] trip.]] 
'''North Dakota''': A big fucking piece of [[nothing]]. Colder than [[Maryland]]([[Wut?]]). Residents usually have to build bonfires in cars to stop the antifreeze from freezing. And even then, the fire usually ends up freezing. Hell, the snow even freezes. 

North Dakota proves that a state can be made entirely of [[fail]], [http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/2k6/stateUnderageDrinking/underageDrinking.htm under-age drinking] and gun-toting [[rednecks]] and not be [[Alabama]].  [[Some argue]] that North Dakota actually ''is'' Alabama, only frozen over and without the [[niggers]]. Also, North Dakota is the most [[Religion|religious]] state in the Union after [[South Dakota]], which makes life for [[user:clk22|the single fucking /b/tard]] in the state very hard.

Oh, and there are also [[Native Americans|Indians]].  The kind with the feathers, not the dots. They are known to withstand the worst of snowstorms, walking [[at least 100]] miles in -60 degree weather to buy a 40.

It has also been postulated many deeds and promises will finally be carried out, as Hell has indeed frozen over.

* Has a [[college]] hockey team with the nickname "Fighting Sioux."

* Has nothing worth visiting, if you want to see anything you may think is worth seeing in North Dakota, its probably also in some other state.

* It is required for all residents to hate South Dakotans and Native Americans.
* Residents do not believe in [[black people]] because there is no such thing black people in North Dakota.  They're just those strange white people painted black for television.

== North Dakota Discovers [[Emo]]s and the [[Internet]]s ==
<video type="youtube" id="Ri6ySOHoDfk" width="480" height="385" frame="true" />
On Friday, February 23, 2007, WDAZ, the Grand Forks news station staffed by alcoholic University of North Dakota graduates ([[Fact|Fact]]: UND's communication program lost its accreditation in 1992), discovered [[emo]].  They immediately unleashed their research team on the [[internet]], unearthing such [[unfunny]] websites from [[at least 100 years ago]] as the "I must be emo" [[YouTube]] video and some [[quizilla]] quiz about [[suicide|quitting IRL]] [[for the win]]. As WDAZ is made of fail and AIDS, they took this shit seriously, interviewing [[fat|overweight]] [[16 year old girl]]s and even a sheriff's deputy. 

Sample quotes:
*"We don't understand it because we don't have that pain"
*"not what you say gothic, but close to it"
*"all black hair...it covers one eye.  The point of this is they'll only see the world in half view."
*"Emo is short for emotional"
*"Some of them [[cut]] themselves and they like to wear tight clothes"
*"Emos, or emotional people, are first noticed by what they wear, but it's what they do that's dangerous."
*"There's a point system with this fashion...the emo scale is what they call it."
*[[Winrar|"You hit the jackpot if you <del>attempt</del> complete suicide."]]

[[Cutting]] is also mentioned [[over 9000]] times.

EMO IS [[serious business|SERIOUS BUSINESS]].
