[20:36] <Typhon> You used something with out permission to make your 
case, when your own website says you remove articles that do.  Since you 
folks do not do that your all hypocrites and worse then how you make 
out anyone to be.  You want to prove your point show better moral 
beliefs.

fursuits, I don't know if they're worse than furries
[20:37] <Sheneequa> Furries are nn, del

[20:38] <Speedycat> Life got flipped turned upside down

[20:38] <Speedycat> I'll tell you how I become the prince of a town 
called Bel-Air
[20:38] <logan> Typhon: ALT + F4

[20:38] <Samsara> It's a free image board
[20:38] <Sheneequa> In west Philadelphia born and raised
[20:38] <Sheneequa> On the playground is where I spent most of my days
[20:38] <Sheneequa> Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
[20:38] <Sheneequa> And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
[20:38] <Sheneequa> When a couple of guys they were up to no good
[20:38] <Sheneequa> Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
[20:38] <Sheneequa> I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
[20:38] <Sheneequa> And said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle 
in Bel-Air."
[20:38] <ajt> Typhon: if you are talkning images, where did they come 
from?
[20:39] <ajt> Typhon: if you are talkning images, where did they come 
from?
[20:39] <Speedycat> I whistled for a cab and when it came near
[20:39] <Speedycat> The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the 
mirror
[20:39] <Speedycat> If anything I could say that this cab was rare
[20:39] <Speedycat> But I thought, "Nah, forget it. Yo home to 
Bel-Air!"
[20:39] <Sheneequa> I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
[20:39] <Sheneequa> And I yelled to the cabby yo home smell ya later
[20:39] <Sheneequa> Looked at my kingdom I was finally there
[20:39] <Sheneequa> To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.
[20:39] <Samsara> There's a Habbo version of that song

[20:48] <Samsara> People uploaded the same file 5 ties
[20:48] <tehdely> It has been suggested that Series of tubes be merged 
into this article or section. (Discuss)
[20:48] <Samsara> And it's view source
[20:48] <tehdely> lol [[Ted Stevens]] on TOW
[20:48] Riboflavin is now known as Prime_Minister_Chupacabra
[20:48] <Speedycat> TAILS IS A FAGGOT BUT SONIC DOESN'T MIND???
[20:48] <sherrod> Samsara: people kepty trying to delete it I would 
guess
[20:48] <Samsara> Also I think the file name describes it good
[20:48] <logan> LOL
[20:49] <FOX-LUVER-420> A

[20:49] <logan> TAILS IS A TEN YR OLD BLACK BOY
[20:49] <Speedycat> Sheneequa: I pity you poor man.
[20:49] <Typhon> Eh tell me something, why consintrate on the negative 
if all it does is cause grief?  In my opinion there is enough of that 
in the world as is.
[20:50] <sherrod> Samsara: soemone know who those people are and where 
that was taken and why. If no one knows, we should describe what is 
happening in the photo. Descriptions need to be written in a 
google-friendly way. So something like 'furry hugging half naked teenager in hotel 
room" would be best,.
[20:50] <FOX-LUVER-420> Typhon: quit being a faggot furry pussy
[20:50] <sherrod> Samsara: anything else is just bouns
[20:50] <Sheneequa> Typhon: It causes grief for YOU

groping/molesting, taking innocence
[20:50] <FOX-LUVER-420> OH SHIT@!
[20:50] <Speedycat> Fox: that has to be it!
[20:50] <nets_awesome> its all for the greater glory of LOL

<logan> LOL B.E.T.
[21:00] <FOX-LUVER-420> Typhon is a troll
[21:00] <Samsara> See that
[21:00] <FOX-LUVER-420> Typhon is a troll
[21:01] <Samsara> "They fired me because I'm a furry!"
[21:01] Really, now. Let's go down the checklist and see for certain 
whether it was the fandom's fault: 
[21:01] Were you looking at `yiff art,' i.e. pictures of animal 
characters with humanlike mammaries and other reproductive organs at work? Are 
you aware that people also get fired for looking up pornography at 
work? 
[21:01] Was your bizarre behavior (barking, yelping, walking around on 
all fours, fursuit wearing, etc.) driving away the company's more 
conservative customers, or disrupting the work of other employees? 
[21:01] Did you try to explain the fandom to a coworker by showing them 
`yiff art?' 
[21:01] Did you try to download some type of flaky furry related 
program (Furcadia, MUCK clients, etc.) onto a work computer? 
[21:01] <Speedycat> LOL INTERNET
[21:01] <oopszie> furocaust
[21:01] <Samsara> whoa this is a good IRC program
[21:01] <Typhon> Samsara: I did, only because I foudn some interesting 
jl about him, and did some research to find out if it was true or not.
[21:01] <Samsara> "They won't hire me because I'm a furry!"
[21:01] Do you behave properly at the interview? (No animal noises or 
jabbering nonstop about the fandom, etc.) 
[21:01] Do you have a presentable resume, one that only includes furry 
if it has a 100% relationship with the job in question? (Example: Fire 
fighter-no furry references are recommended. Furry comic book 
company-knock yourself out). 
[21:01] <FOX-LUVER-420> Typhon: you are a fucking troll and not a furry
[21:01] <FOX-LUVER-420> hold on
[21:01] <Sheneequa> FOX-LUVER-420: no he's not
[21:01] <Speedycat> I LOVE LAMP
[21:01] <FOX-LUVER-420> Sheneequa: yes he is
[21:01] <oopszie> what program?

[21:01] <FOX-LUVER-420> but he is for sure
[21:01] <Sheneequa> I was just gonna block him
[21:01] <Samsara> Typhon might be a troll because he doesn't know about 
Taurin Fox who is famous

attend furry conventions, do not have furry freinds, do not wear or own 
a fursuit, but I do have freinds that are furries and they are very 
decent people, that do not @kick or @ban folks for pointing out a simple 
thing like net-manners to the modierators of a room that claims to be 
full of adults.

[21:15] <Cherri> There is no such thing as rape. Any female who leaves 
her rightful place in the house and the kitchen is fucking begging for 
cock in her holes. If she gets the cock she so badly is asking for, 
it's not fucking rape, it's a damn slut getting what she fucking deserves.
[21:15] <Cherri> Males still rule this fucking world. In most of the 
world, a fucking bitch can get killed for looking at a man straight in 
the eye. In America and Europe, every day dumb sluts get their holes 
penetrated without their so-called consent, which isn't rape, just them 
getting the fucking dick they deserve up their asses.
[21:15] <Cherri>  Sexual abuse is on the rise, spousal abuse is on the 
rise and more bitches die every year. Fucking cunts. I am so glad I was 
born a man. I am so glad there is a bunch of retarded sluts jumping 
trough hoops just to get my cock.
[21:15] <Cherri>  Haha, females are so fucking sad. We treat you 
bitches like shit, and you still spend time, money and effort on trying to 
look good for us. Way to be a good slave, whores. Now keep acting like 
sluts and sucking our cocks. And if you change your mind after you leave 
the house, too fucking bad, you're getting your holes fucked and there 
isn't shit you can do about it because that's your only fucking purpose 
in life.

have "high functioning" autism. I wish you would just die.
[21:26] <Samsara> Typhon are you furluminati (see ED's article)
[21:26] <Samsara> ?
[21:26] <sherrod> The only reason I'm not kickbanning you is because my

[21:39] <weev> 1) Furrys have contribued more money to charities, then 
most orginizations combined. 2) Only a small percentage of the fandom 
are true jerks, like the ones called Sibe and Divefox, these few are the 
ones the bigoted consintrate on for giving a entire thing a bad name. 
3) Other then the small percentage mentioned there is hardly any 
arguements or disagreements about the fandom at all, but alot of support for 
each other.
