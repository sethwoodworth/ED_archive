'''Amorrow''' (Andrew William Morrow, [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=2166+Pulgas+Ave,+Palo+Alto,+CA+94303&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=29.772081,61.523437&ie=UTF8&g=2166+Pulgas+Ave,+Palo+Alto,+CA+94303&layer=c&cbll=37.470657,-122.14778&panoid=u65MrdA-Q5VUE9AfvoJ0ZA&cbp=13,264.85,,0,5&hq=&hnear=2166+Pulgas+Ave,+East+Palo+Alto,+San+Mateo,+California+94303&ll=37.470686,-122.14767&spn=0.007647,0.01266&z=16 Google Street View], resident of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Palo_Alto,_California East Palo Alto], CA Vehicle Lic. Plate # 3RDX901) is yet another ignorant vitalist and mind-body dualist on the Internet. According to some [[Lesbian|feministic attention whores]], he kills the women he meets on the [[internets]], makes cardigans from their skins, and eats their ovaries in hopes of gaining their superpowers. In truth, he's just a [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|boring know-it-all]] who would [[Incontinent Student Bodies|wet his pants]] in the event of meeting an actual woman.

Amorrow is a [[ban]]ned [[Wikipedia]] editor who shares the dubious honor of being been banned from both TOW and the [[Wikipedia Review]] with [[Blissyu2]] and [[Malber]]. Due to his seriously boring writing on Encyclopedia Dramatica, even more so than Blissyu2, he earned the Triple Crown  of being banned from TOW, WR and ED. He was an [[insane]] [[stalker]] and [[internet tough guy]] who liked to posture about going to [[Wikimania]] to "confront" some editors, though it turned out whining about being picked on by girls was more his speed. He has also spent some time in jail for stalking the [[TOW]] admin [[Alison]] [[IRL]].

For the [[Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines|official]] [[ban]] rationale, rewind all the way back to the summer of [[2005]]; Amorrow lets his inner [[Nazi]] out to play and threatens to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Facts_of_Reproduction&oldid=20551201 fucking shoot someone] if they dared to [[baleet]] his article.
{{quote2|Xaa: The German High Command knew how to maintain order and discipline. You screw up, I take a real, live bystander and [[Headshot|shoot him in the head]]. [[Wikipedia:Michael Sylvester|Michael Sylvester]]. It is that simple and it is your fault. Please notify me before you add any more vfd's to pages that I have created. We negotiate first from now on, buddy.|Amorrow, working on some fucking [[serious business]]}}

The truly [[funny|pathetic]] part is that he wasn't even talking about literally killing someone; it was his sick fantasy that writing a biased Wikipedia article about someone is somehow equivalent to shooting them in the head.

The [[zomg]] behind the scenes reason was that he was he was engaging in [[internet stalking|stalking]] and [[harassment]], the gravest violations of [[Internet law]], and his targets were several [[admin]]s. He had a creepy fascination with female Wikipedia editors, simultaneously worshipping and hating them because they have the [[brain|organs]] he wishes he had, and went so far as to prank-call some of them using [[Skype]]. Shockingly, the TOW admins didn't appreciate that [[bullshit]], and he was [[permaban]]ned for epic [[fail]].

I guess...|2=Just read [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Elizabeth_Morgan&oldid=20594327#Let_us_talk_about_the_page_here this talk page,] it's scarier than anything we could say}}

His Wikipedia Review ban happened nearly a year later, in June [[2006]], after the admins there finally got tired of his incessant bitching/drooling over female Wikipedia editors, his persecution complex, and his habit of being an asshole to everybody. He appears to believe that [[Blu Aardvark]] and [[Mistress Selina Kyle]] banned him in exchange for having [[Linuxbeak]] lift their Wikipedia bans, which went [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents/Blu Aardvark and Mistress Selina Kyle|about as well as could be expected]]. Of course, even a terminal douchebag like Amorrow couldn't inspire that kind of epic drama, but [[unwarranted self-importance|try telling him that]].

Amorrow then disappeared, as the cops took his computer away all [[Kevin Mitnick|Mitnick-style]] for internets terrorism.

==Back for more==

[[Image:Barack Victory.jpg|thumb|It says [[cock|DIK]] on the label]]

All was well until September 2007, when WP admins were once again summoned [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive308#The_return_of_Amorrow  to the anti-exile guns], and women everywhere hid under their beds at the mere thought of that misogynist lunatic coming back. The only real drama that resulted was a short ban of fellow self-righteous stalker [[Everyking]] for restoring one of Amorrow's [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Everyking&diff=164803992&oldid=164654974 insane posts].

Recently, Amorrow has decided to inflict his presence on ED, filling this article with a bunch of crazy [[tl;dr]] [[crap]] about girls he likes and what he did on his summer vacation. Be sure to let him know you appreciate him by [[User:Amorrow|decorating his user page]].

Spending his spring sitting at his computer, Amorrow relentlessly trolled dozens of articles. In the chaos of the [[drama bomb]] Amorrow had dropped, [[Wikipedia:User:Majorly|Majorly]], an administrator, was 
claimed by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=199258200#Infinite_block_of_Majorly_by_East718 an errant banhammer], in a tragic case of friendly fire. 

==Stalking of Alison thanks to Daniel Brandt==

{{Quote|I am like a juvenile, I am still just learning how to use this '''powerful new tool''' of stripping real live females minds (and all other minds as well) of every last shred of their privacy that they are so accustomed to as they plot their next selfish and destructive move, ripping my society that my founding fathers created into jokes and tiny shreds of confetti with their '''female machinations''', leaving my glorious country weak and stupid and incapable of competing in the global marketplace and leaving us staggering until a national debt, mostly to China. You '''scheming females need to be drilled, drilled, drilled''' until the truth finally emerges from those mouths of yours about the truth about yourselves.|2=W T F . . . ? ! ? !}}

[[Alison]] is currently purging her internet history after Daniel Brandt tried to [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=16801 sell her dox to the highest bidder].

After Brandt gave out her dox, Amorrow finally validated all the rumors about him, taking his e-vendetta against Wikipedia to the [[real world]], by driving to an Allison's office building to [[vandal]]ize from the company's WiFi connection. Fortunately, Amorrow is as stupid as he is creepy. Upon using [[IP address|CheckUser]], Alison realized that Amorrow was sitting outside in the parking lot in true stalker style. Thinking quickly, she blocked the IP address, forcing Amorrow to move on another wireless hotspot, and she escaped the premises safely. Thwarted, Amorrow now just drives around the city where she lives and visits public library and [[Internet cafes]] and the local [http://www.wikimapia.org/289369/Donut-Wheel Donut Wheel] to post from that IP to say to her "hey, I am in the same city as you", leaving behind a semen-encrusted keyboard.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/17.255.134.228 Apple Corp.

DHCP address 17.255.134.94]  In response, she has been removing mention of him on Wikipedia.

He might actually take that into consideration when it comes to the further maintenance of his honest, truthful hivemind page.|[[LOLWUT]] message to [[Alison]]}}

<blockquote>So Andrew Morrow, smug as can be, saunters over to the building I work in and into reception. I'd got a frantic phone call from corp. security ordering me not to leave my office. Of course, I did. Duh! I got out close enough to see him walking in the front door.<br><br>

And then something kinda clicked there. Here's this grinning, smug little fucker walking in the door thinking he owns the world. Internet Tough Guy, as they say on ED. I felt like laughing in his face, the sad, pathetic little man that he is. He's even sadder than he appears in his pics [''laugh emoticon''] And ultimately, he was a coward. He left his little 'gifts' at the main desk, turned tail and ran just as some burly dudes showed up (including two of my mates, who wanted to pound the bastard into the dirt).<br><br>

I never got his 'gifts' - never touched them - though I saw copies of the documents, etc. Security got them, and ultimately, the police did. On that visit, the pathetic little creep had hastily scrawled on a piece of paper. "I (heart) Alison [''last name censored''], [''company censored''] Inc. Building [XXX] " - just to say, ''"I know what building you work in. Booga-booga!!"''<br><br>

Sad, pathetic little man. While he was on his last "vacation", I got prepared. He'd better keep well the fuck away from me and my family [''angry emoticon''] He got ten days in jail for beating his (now-ex) wife. This is where he's at, so I'm under no illusions.<span style="float: right">—[[Alison]] (<span class="plainlinks"></span>)</span></blockquote>

==You blew it!!!==
After spending four months of [[2007]] behind bars, Amorrow has once again been shown to be the biggest failure on the Internet, when he was sent back to jail in Spring 2008 for another four months. He expended his freedom by incessantly trolling on Wikipedia. After sending letter bombs to [[It was a social experiment|make people ponder their mortality]], Andrew showed up in a public place with a baseball bat of undetermined size.  The cops were *not* amused, and a probation hearing and four more months of jail soon followed.

==The Gift that Just Keeps on Giving==
Uh-oh! Not content with two rounds of jailtime, Amorrow goes for the hat-trick when he's [http://www.sccaseinfo.org/pa6.asp?full_case_number=1-08-CH-001979 pwned] by the ex-[[Cops|Chief of Police of Palo Alto]], when she serves him with a restraining order as a result of "Workplace Violence".

Many nights of [[rape|surprise]] [[buttsex|cuddling]] in jail quickly converted Andrew to [[homosexuality]]. Upon his release in late 2008, he proceeded to [[faggotry|prance around]] and [[camwhore|take pictures for all the Internets to enjoy]]. Female [[TOW]] admins can sleep soundly now, since male admins are now the apple of Amorrow's eye.
