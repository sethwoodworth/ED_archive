The '''tourist guy''' is an [[old|ancient]] [[unfunny]] [[meme]] that existed [[at least 100]] years before [[Web 2.0]] was even [[pregnant|conceived of]].

It started with an image that was supposedly recovered from a camera found at [[9/11|Ground Zero]], of a man standing on top of the [[JEWS DID WTC|World Trade Center]] with a plane visible in the background. The image was passed around in email as "the last moments of a tourist's life," but the plane and the timestamp were obviously [[shopped]], and [[Snopes]] debunked it quickly.[http://www.snopes.com/rumors/photos/tourist.asp]

A couple of months later, a guy from [[Hungary]] [http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/11/48397 came forward] and admitted that, not only was he the guy in the picture, he actually did the original shop [[I did it for the lulz|for the lulz]].

As with most image memes, Tourist Guy was quickly beaten into the ground, and now he's considered about as acceptable for shoops as [[Happy Negro]]. Possible use as an [[intentional old meme]] has not been explored.
