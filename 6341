Penthouse
[[Image:nicetits.jpg|thumb|right|Politics and protest?]]


After starting out as probably the worst [[porn]]o mag since Playboy, Penthouse nearly folded due to excessive spending by founder Bob Guccione, an inability to change their business model to cope with the advent of the [[Internets]] and Earl Fucking Miller. Billed as the magazine of [[politics]] and protest in order to avoid obscenity laws in the [[USA]], it could only be considered such if you were a [[NASCAR]] [[fanboy]] [[retard]] whose greatest aspiration was fucking their wife's sister. 

Penthouse has a variant for each country it is published in, and so publishes everything from [[Japanese]]ese [[sick fuck]]ery to [[German]] [[User:Banaan|scat]]. Penthouse is also notable for having as many [[gay]] phone [[sex]] adds as straight in the back pages, most of which are answered by Earl Fucking Miller.|}

==Earl Fucking Miller==

The [[faggot|man]] most responsible for the near collapse of Penthouse Magazine, after [[Italian]] chubby-chaser Bob Guccione. Miller bills himself as an "[[American]] [[Pervert]]" and unlike most self-promotion he's not actually lying. His photography consists largely of extreme and disorientating close-ups coupled (heh) with [[piss|toilet]] and [[shit|excretion]] themed poses. He also has a disturbing propensity for filling supposedly hetero photo series with [[in the ass|male ass]] close-ups.
