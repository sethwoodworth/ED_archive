Lesbian invisibility

Lesbians have very advanced equipment, the most important being their '''lesbian invisibility'''. This superpower will render the lesbian almost completely invisible (especially in darkness and if standing still, better than Hide in Plain Sight Feat and it doesn't require ranks on hide or move silently skills). This is essential to the lesbian's survival, because the creature's objective is to be a [[stalk]]er. 

In the early 1990s, the [[United States]] Department of Defense headed by [[Elgorgo]] tested a form of camouflage on [[fat dyke|fat bull dyke]]s that used millions of fiber-optic cables to "mirror" the opposite side of the object that is wanting to be hidden. They got the idea from lesbian invisibility.

[[Heterosexual]] women have attempted to achieve invisibility by performing [[cunnilingus]] on each other. Unfortunately this only results in transparency. [[Heterosexual]]s in general, on the other hand, have managed to develop [[Heterosexual Invisibility|somewhat-comparable technology]].
