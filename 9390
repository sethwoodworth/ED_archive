Originally, title has consisted of the following: white (color of gray snow) background appears, at the left side of screen appears black line (springboard), and moves to right, vibrating. Vibration  is accompanied by a sound, like a jackhammer, or old movie projector. Then, at the left appears a small gray sphere, that jumps on the line to end and falls downwards. Falling, it changes size to dot and explodes, then appearing flash circles , explosion accompanied by five chordes, sounds creepy, like a fatality theme from Mortal Kombat. After this screen instantly fades and from the dark appears VID's face.. Below appears gold inscription "ВИD" and shining.

Now actually about memetic. Imagine - you're just a child who wants to watch TV. And here you sit, enjoy sitting on a comfortable sofa. Nothing worries you ... And then, SUDDENLY, on the screen, with loud terrifying sounds, appears a fucking scary face of and looks at you. How would you feel at this moment?
Having seen this mask, children were terribly frightened, cried, hid himself under a pillow or escaped from a room. This logo traumatized mind the majority of Russian children.

On the Internet, particularly on youtube, you can find a lot of parodies on the original titlescreen. A meme is popular mainly among people who were born in the 90s and knew the horror when displaying the logo on TV.

==The real facts==
[[File:Guo_Xiang.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Guo Xiang, original mask]]
The main person of a broadcasting company of ViD - Vlad Listyev, long thought that to it to use as a logo. His wife worked in an east museum - she has prompted to Vlad to use for a logo the ceramic sculpture representing a head of the ancient Chinese philosopher by name of Guo Xiang.
But workers of a museum have forbidden to use it as the sculpture was a death symbol. In ancient China there was an execution - people were beheaded and instead of the chopped off head similar sculptures laid down. To take with itself, and furthermore to show it on the TV was very bad idea. Then a mask have decided to recreate by means of graphic editors. The original mask, despite the deadly properties attributed to it, didn't look frightening. But that that has turned out at designers wasn't similar to the original. It was deathly pale color and was similar to a corpse. Not clearly, than Vlad thought but the turned out ugliness began to appear on country screens every day. In structure with psychodelic visual making and creepy music, it was to force enough shit bricks the whole people.
After five years Vlad Listyev has been killed by the unknown person.
People from a museum in which Vlad's wife worked, consider that in his death the ill-fated mask is guilty.

==Another Versions==
One of the parodies represented animated logo. ВИD suddenly opened eyes and showed the tongue.
When kids unexpectedly see it, they shit bricks a lot.
