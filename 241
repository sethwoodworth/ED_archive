'''Adult Swim''' is a block of programming on [[4Kids|Cartoon Network]] to show [[Circumcision|uncut]] anime, but instead is used to showcase their shitty sitcom ideas while high on [[weed|skunky weed]]. It's also a dumping ground for failed network shows, [[Tom_green|guys who are members of the "Bob Odenkirk Cocksucking Circle"]], and failed [[fag|indie]] comic writers. Some time later, it was decided that Saturdays would be devoted to anime, adding 14 year old girls to the [[retard|Target Demographic]]. The lineups have since blended and Adult Swim continues to pollute the airwaves on TV. Given the painfully [[No more than 99|low budget]] of their shows, and their overt support of [[ATHF Terrorist Attack|terrorism]], it's safe to assume that Adult Swim is run by self-loathing Japanese people of Jew origin. Adult Swim is especially hated by [[weeaboo]]s who still feed from their moms' tits and shit, because they're too busy [[BAWWW]]ing over the lack of ''[[Inuyasha]]'' in the current schedule and writing [[slashfic]] to bother [[aspie|having a social life]]. 

== Bumps [They're fucking retarded.]==

[[Image:Bump hippo.jpg|thumb|A different kind of [[bump]].]]

One of their [[shit|trademarks]] is that in between [[pr0n|shows]], there is [[racism|white text on a black background]] in which the gays at Cartoon Network get to showcase their [[h8|utter contempt]] for their [[16-year-old_girl|viewers]], in a "[[unwarranted_self-importance|I'm better than]] [[you]]! You suck the [[tubgirl|shit out of my asshole]] 'cause I [[suck|rule]] and you drool!" hackery. Sadly, it's [[duh|obvious]] that they put more time into writing these [[unfunny|bumps]] than any of their [[shit|shows]].

== Merchandise ==

[[Image:Adult swim.jpg|thumb|Fast food is cool, kids!]]

Historically, '''Adult Swim''' has tried and [[fail|failed]] to sell their [[shit|merchandise]]. They [[Epic fail|failed]] so hard that it's traditional to view any [[fail|attempt]] by them to sell their stuff with [[LOL|laughter]] due to the way that they inevitably let [[W|politics]] ruin the product. [[shit_nobody_cares_about|Most notably]] was when they tried to launch a line of [[toys|action figures]]; instead of figures people wanted, we received complete shit in it's place because the creators wanted toys of characters THEY wanted, not figures that paying [[losers|customers]] wanted, resulting in a wave of [[Plastic crap|Phil Ken Sebben, a Bear, Master Shake, and MC Pee Pants figures]] [[Nobody|no one]] bought, killing the entire toy line as a result. 

The network instead has had most of its luck with hats and clothing based on ''[[ATHF Terrorist Attack|Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''. The people who consciously purchase this garbage are mainly post-[[goth]]ic [[art_school|community college]] [[fags]] who eat at [[fat|IHOP]] at 2:00 AM daily, speaking and [[LOL]]ing at [[at least 100]] decibels, perhaps under the [[unrealistic_expectations|impression]] that they are [[unwarranted_self-importance|societal elites]] or even that [[no_one|someone]] enjoys or [[h8|respects]] their [[shit|uniqueâ„¢]] and [[pussy|edgy]] [[unfunny|humor]].

== Incarnations ==
Adult Swim has gone down more times than a 12 year old Taiwanese [[prostitute|hooker]]. Constantly [[jumped the shark|jumping the shark]], it suffered most notably in the past when it lost the rights to ''[[Simpsons|Futurama]]'' and self-inflicted a gunshot wound to it's face by killing off 99% of its [[weeaboo|anime line-up]]. Only the new season of ''[[Homosexuality|Venture Brothers]]'' has saved the network this year, as well as the kickback money Brendon Small is forced to pay Mike Lazzo out of his fortune via the [[Juggalo|Dethklok/''Metalocalypse'']] cash cow, as payment for Lazzo saving Small's career and sparing him from having to go back to his former job as an underpaid [[gay]] for pay bottom in [[porn]] movies.

== No Moar Anime ==
[[Last Thursday|Sometime in the middle of March]], Adult Swim announced that they were finally pulling their "almost final solution" to the anime problem by removing all anime from their weekday lineup, sparing only ''[[Inuyasha]]'' because they knew even die-hard anime nerds hate ''Inuyasha''. [[Butthurt]] [[weeaboo]]s bitched and moaned about how this was unfair, and a complete violation of their weekly scheduled [[jacking off|masturbation]] times, in-between downloading more shows illegally from glorious Nippon and continue hurting the business they claim to support. Adult Swim later pulled their real "final solution" and relegated anime to 5 in the morning, safe from human eyes.

Adult Swim whined back that ratings was why they took anime off the network, saying it never pulled in the ratings. This makes sense, as [[Jewnited States|Americans]] got sick and tired of slope shows on their television devices years ago and now every anime company in the U.S. is bleeding cash or [[bullshit|shutting down]]. When butthurt fantards complained back that Adult Swim never, EVER promoted or advertised anime, Mike Lazzo basically replied saying it wasn't worth it, and Adult Swim would rather concentrate on plug-whoring their own shitty shows so they can keep all the money, just like the other [[Old Media|media companies]]. 

Adult Swim is now a low-rated channel, thanks to butthurt weeaboos everywhere, and with lots of ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''Robot Chicken'', ''Delocated'' and ''[[Homosexual|Tim and Eric]] [[Shit|Awesome]] Show [[Lie|Great Job]]''. Butthurt fantards know the ''truth'' of the matter, correctly claiming the block is worse off now and that anime is "Adult Swim's only saving grace". They're not watching ''[[Shit|Tyler Perry's House of Shit]]''.

To spite Adult Swim, many anime fantards have moved to support Sci-Fi Channel's "Ani-Monday," a Monday night block featuring [[Shit|shitty]] anime no one wants to watch. Except ''[[Gurren Lagann]]'', of course. Manga Entertainment [[LOL|actually has to pay the Sci-Fi Channel to run them]].

[[Image:Thatsbrutal.jpg|thumb|Moar liek Dethkok!! hurhurhurhur]]   
*[[Family Guy]] - Has never been funny on any network.  Example: "Less used than [[Harry_Potter|Alan Rickman's]] [[toys|answering machine]]". 
*Robot Chicken - kills [[OVER 9000]] pieces of plastic crap each episode. Still not enough to make up for the fail. If not for [[jewtube|kicks in the balls,]] [[fail|there wouldn't be 10 minutes of their show.]]
*<strike>Tom Goes To The Mayor - made by Tim and Eric so it automatically FAILS.</strike>  -Baleeted from the network.     
*[[Death Note]] - anime for [[scene]] faggots .    
*[[Inuyasha]]-(unless you're a [[furry]])   
*The Brak Show - gay ass showtunes and lame music that was never funny   
*Big O - [[Batman]] meets [[Gundam Wing|Gundam]] = [[meh]]
*Frisky Dingo - good luck understanding any joke without seeing every previous episode. fans look at this show like it's the holy grail of AS despite it's overt shittiness. 
*[[Racism|Minoriteam]] - Favored contender for '''Worst TV Show Ever Made'''. Made up entirely of nonstop racism, shitty animation and unfunny. Basically what would happen if those inbreds over at [[Stormfront]] decided to make a TV show. Cancellation after one season was too nice of a death.
*[[Goatse|Assy McGee]] - Get it? It's like a archetypal 80 cop drama...BUT THE MAIN CHARACTER IS AN ASS UHYBDS AL OLOLOLOL OL OLOLLO now you've heard every joke from every episode
*[[Bleach]] - Basically the only thing keeping [[Narutard]]s from wiping out Cartoon Network with their extreme [[butthurt]]. Contains the same amount of faggotry as [[Naruto]].
*[[Retard|Saul of the Mole Men]] was funny in the first episode, kept going on and on until no one gave a shit
*Stroker and Hoop - The same shit you would get on [[MTV]].
*Lucy: Daughter of the Devil - tried to be edgy, no one cared, got canceled 
*[[The Mighty Boosh]]  - Britfag humour. Almost as bad as the British Office.
*[[Christian|Moral Orel]] - Season Three was [[some argue|arguably]] the classiest thing that was ever aired on AS. Then it got canceled. To this day, there are no DVD releases of Moral Orel's second and third season.
*<strike>Delocated</strike>. - Popular with [[13 year old boys]]. Would completely fail if not for the amazing [[Art Fag|Paul Rudd]].  
*Harvey Birdman - this show was actually funny because it had Steven Colbert but isn't funny anymore because he quit to do more impersonations of a white black person.   
*[[Alcohol|The Drinky Crow Show]] 
*If not for [[fart]] jokes, [[lemonparty|Adult Swim]] wouldn't have any of these shows.
[[Image:warden.jpg|right|thumb|The Warden.]] 
[[Image:IM001586.jpg|right|thumb|MOAR LIKE THE WARDEN WANTS TO DO THE 13 YEAR OLD GIRL, AMIRITE?!]]
* [[ATHF Terrorist Attack|Aqua Teen Hunger Force]] - It was hilarious back in the day, but now it just <s>kinda</s> sucks.
*Space Ghost Coast to Coast - Still funnier than Conan O'Brian.  
* Superjail - It's like your average violent AS Show, but with actual [[lulz]] and David Wain as The Warden. The same 11 episodes have aired nightly for the past 3 years. It used to be cool, until * [http://hot-spice.deviantart.com/ Ace-Cutie aka Spice that burns yo fuckin' eyes] basically ruined teh internetz with her Mary Sue LYKEOMGSUPAKAWAIINURSEKAORUDESUDESU which she enjoys pairing up with The Warden because she's a fat, [[weeaboo]] fuck who can't get any in the real world.
* [[Sealab 2021]] - Harry Goz is god.
*[[Pickles|Metalocalypse]] - I DO COCAINE!!! Side note; Metalocalypse is teh [[Lulz|lulz]] and [[you]] should watch it,  because it is [[Metal]]. The only thing more [[Metal]] than than Metalocalypse is [[France|Franc]]ium, which [[Awesome|FUCKING EXPLODES]] when placed in water, if you even make it to a water source, as Francium is both radioactive AND highly reactive, meaning that [[You|you]] will probably [[An Hero|lose a few limbs]] if you carry said substance around with you without a [[Lube|protective layer of oil]].
*[[OH GOD BILL|Home Movies]] - Looks like it was drawn by a five-year-old with a [[retard|learning disability]]. Which is why its so funny, among other [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Satire things.] It was only funny because of McGuirk AKA H Jon Benjamin, and Louis C.K.
*[[Squidbillies]] - An urban Southerner's version of some hick's Oxycontin nightmare rendered in glorious MS Paint. One of the most original and lulzy shows ever made.
* [[The Boondocks]] - This show is like [[Divide by zero|dividing by zero]]. It has [[animu]] AND There are no black people on the Internet, but still manages to produce [[lulz]]. Need explanation, [[plox]].
*[[Hank Hill|King of the Hill]] - Annoying [[Texas|Texans]] with narrow urethras talking about propane. No explanation needed. Also, featured [[Brittany Murphy]] who's [[Drug|FUCKING DEAD!!!!]]olololololol11111
* The Office - Don't get excited, it's the [[Britfag]] version.
* [[Troll|Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]] - Glorified [[YouTube Poop]]. Each episode dedicates 8 minutes of run time to men tongue kissing and gay ass musical numbers because they're just a bunch of queer ass fags. [[Srsly]] this show is gayer than 27 guys fucking 9 guys. Known to celebrate [[Caturday]].
*[[Gundam_Wing|Titan Maximum]] - Seth Green dick sucking at work, he basically created it to troll anime for almost ruining Adult Swim. Even though its been already done with that Perfect Hair Forever show.
*[[Life|Xavier: Renegade Angel]] - Always fucks everything up for everyone. Like a fucking acid trip. Made by the same guys that made the extremely lulzy (but often overlooked) ''Wonder Showzen''
*[[England|Garth Marenghi's ''Darkplace'']] - modern day rendition of bad 70s dramas. worth checking out.
*The Venture Brothers - A show about [[Fail|failure]], according to the creators. Sounds like [[you]] can relate. Also full of pussies and [[Veteran|Veterans]].
*Mary Shelley's [[Buttsex|Frankenhole]] - Something Dino Stamatopolous decided to dick around on instead of the delightful Morel Orel. Only exists because of the <i>hil</I>arious celebrity cameos.
*Check It Out with [[Retard|Steve Brule]] - Abysmally shitty spin-off of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, starring the most useless character to receive a spin-off since black person. Thankfully canceled after six episodes.
*Childrens Hospital - Yet another terrible live action program. An unfunny parody of Grey's Anatomy which would be absolutely unwatchable if it weren't for two hot brunette doctors. Of course, one of them got killed off after the first season, but OMG SHE COMES BACK!!!!!121 Basically a poor man's [[Zach Braff|Scrubs]]. Should have remained a webseries.

==Kitties==
Now at [[website|Adultswim.com]] they have a section on cats with hats on. The first one is [[photoshop]]ped while others are just abused fat cats. The reason why they created this section is unknown. Most likely because they're [[retard]]ed [[furry|furfags]].
