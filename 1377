[[weeaboo|ARN'T THEY KAWAII?1??!!? ^_____^]]

The most common traits of the catgirl are having the ears and tail of a cat while otherwise looking human and [[whore|having huge fucking tits]]. One of the earliest sightings appears in Egypt where the cat-headed goddess Bastet ruled over the hearth. 

Less common, but still present is the elusive "[[kemonomimi|cat man]]". They are [[sick fucks]] with cat ears who escaped from the depths of yaoi hell to wreak havoc on the [[furfags|sexual preferences]] of many a stupid fangirl. Anywhere this strange monster can be found on the internet, you will also find the crazed comments of horny girls crying out, "ZOMG!!!1!!one!1 HE'S SOOOOOOOOOOOO SMEXY, [[DESU]]!!!11! Any girl who would willingly offer her virginity to these peices of faggotry and fail is obviously extremely stupid, because [[fact|everyone with a brain knows that these creatures are too preoccupied with hawt bishie buttsecks 24/7]] to care about the [[over 9000]] tons of weeaboo girls who would gladly fuck them in a heartbeat.

You can find catgirls  [http://7chan.org/n/ on 7chan too.]
