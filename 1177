'''Brittany Anne Murphy-Monjack''' is a dead crack addict who deserved worse than what she got. When not busy sucking thousands of cocks she made time to play a duck in [[pedobear|kiddie's favorite]] ''Happy Feet''. She did not win an Oscar for her roles in ''Clueless'', ''Girl Intercourse'' or Eminem's ''8 Milligrams'' or for her singing on family favourite ''Faster Vagina [[Meow Meow]]''. 

She first died in the film ''Little Black Book'' and then again in [[2009]], the latter not by acting. Not that anything she ever did could be called ''acting''. She was sacked from the film ''Happy Feet 2'' for being dead and hopes to make a comeback in Lost as yet another incarnation of [[John Locke]].

Whenever a [[Michael Jackson|famous]] celebrity [[Shit nobody cares about|tragically passes]] [[ED]] is right on it. However, the case of [[Whore|Brittany Murphy]] was a [[retarded|special]] one. If by special you mean nobody gave a fuck and it took 3 months before somebody shat out a pathetic [[Lake Angel|failed abortion]] style blasphemy. Fuck you Brittany Murphy, your death is less important than a fart in a hot-tub.

==How to flog a dead actress==
*Take bits of the dead body and embed it in jewelry to sell to the fans.
*Hire out the formaldehyde-preserved genital areas to necrophiliacs.
*Like Sharon Murphy, Brittany's loving mother, and Simon Monjack, Brittany's loving husband, establish the Brittany Murphy Foundation, a charitable fund aimed at raising funds for child abduction, as well as supporting UFOs and cancer. The Foundation was officially launched on February 4, 2010 at an event at the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills where Monjack requested donations of $1,000 per person and $10,000 per corporation to attend, although records search revealed that the foundation's not-for-profit status had not been filed, a move technically known as [[law|fraud]]. Soon thereafter, the foundation announced it would refund any donations received and issued an official letter on the Foundation's website.
