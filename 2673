Entertainment Roleplay
[[Image:typicalmuse.jpg|thumb|A typical muse will have a paid account, acquired by it's mun sucking up to others.]]
'''Entertainment roleplay''' is a a generally accepted term describing those participants of [[LiveJournal Roleplay]] who pretend to be [[celebrities]], often of [[azn]] descent. These players are [[basement dwellers]] who have [[no life]] or [[16 year old girls]]. They share many traits with the population who play [[animu]] characters (as that is where they originated) except they [[lies|aren't]] [[weaboo|weaboos]] (That's because they are [[koreaboo|koreaboos]]). Please note that it is fucking boring.

A recently coined term is '''musedom'''. It was coined at {{lj|museanon}}. A variant of [[fandom]].


__ToC__


==The Basics==
Basically to get in on this [[entertainment roleplay]] one must enjoy some kind of entertainment. You must also be witty and [[elitist]] as with [[LiveJournal Roleplay]].

You must know every little thing about the muse that you plan to portray. If you don't you are OOC.

==How to Troll==
# Make a journal for your muse.
# Join a comm.
# Fuck up a muse's 'life'. Alternatively fuck with a mun.
# ????
# PROFIT!

==Terms==
Terms that you thought you knew from [[LiveJournal Roleplay]] can carry different connotation with the [[batshit crazy|muns]] of [[entertainment roleplay]].

*Mun - the norm for what [[basement dwellers|players]] call themselves. Rarely do you see 'player' or 'writer' in this form of roleplay.
*Muse - the only [[mundane|normal]] name to call one's character. Any other name means you are [[batshit crazy]] and a metagamer.
*Home - the game that your muse is at. Otherwise known as an LJ comm.
*IC - In character.
*OOC - Out of Character.
*Uber - No, not your [[faggot|faggy]] twelve year old usage, though its close. The easiest way to explain this shit is when your character knows he's a character. Causes [[shitstorms]].
*PSL - Private story line. Only those who [[Forever alone|aren't interested in community life]] use these. They die after one reply most of the time.

=Museanon=
[[Image:typicalthreadnow.jpg|thumb|What {{lj|museanon}} has been reduced to recently.]]
Created by [[BNF]] [[anonymous]] [[last Thursday]], {{lj|museanon}} has been a place of (at time) [[lulz]], [[drama]], and [[faggot|faggots]] congregating to [[circlejerk]]. Has been called the [[B|/b/]] of [[LJ]], and sometimes the [[Craigslist]] of LiveJournal. It is likely to have been inspired by {{lj|rp_anon_meme}} and its other relatives. Since its creation, it has gone under new management and gained "rules". Most so-called [[oldfag|oldfags]] know of or have participated in it at some point in time, before they [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]] because they are [[butthurt]].

You can easily fit in if you complain about rules, how your muse isn't being fucked, or just [[bawww]] in general. Also starting a [[Japanese]] versus [[Korean]] war would be ideal.

==Failed Attempts to Overthrow Museanon==
Since its creation, angry muns among others have tried and failed to overthrow the power that is museanon. Museanon has 'closed' on more than one occasion, however only to return to the throne it once had.

{{lj|gossipmuse}} was an attempt to start an IC [[shit|gossip girl]] based community, utilizing [[Twitter]]. Whoever was behind this operation [[epic fail| failed epically]] and must have fallen off the face of the earth.

{{lj|nonaesum}} pretty self-explanatory, we think.

{{lj|saranganon}} was created in order to try and get the wank/trolling/etc. specifically about the community {{lj|sarangbox}} off of museanon. Needless to say, it failed.

==Other Notable Incidents==
===New Ownership of Museanon===
Sometime [[last thursday]], museanon's ownership changed from {{lj|kaya}} to {{lj|inheritable}} after some newfags showed up and posted {{lj|kaya}}'s information, and she got tired of the burden that comes with owning one of the assholes of the internet. The new mod doesn't give a shit about the place.

===Let's Leave Museanon===
Happened sometime [[last Thursday]], when a bunch of [[japs]] got together and decided that at 12:01AM they would no longer visit museanon. LULZ followed.


==={{lj|Musesanon}}===
Sometime when the mod decided he didn't give a fuck about RP anymore and decided to stop modding {{lj|museanon}}, this place was created.

Has recently become a place just for lists.

===The Museanon Drinking Game===
Shot everytime:
*someone's looking for a (insert band who recently came back) member to fuck<br>
*someone says "in b4" or "[[butthurt]]" or "[[samefag]]" or "[[lulz]]"<br>
*someone tries to [[troll]], badly<br>
*someone falls for the trolling<br>
*someone asks if ____ and ____ are fucking<br>
*someone complains that ____ is gay/a slut/not fucking their muse<br>
*{{lj|snsdsooyoung}} gets talked about
*{{lj|aerodynes}}
*someone asks for a list of homes
*someone asks where a face is needed instead of checking claims lists
*someone asks why we all can't just get alooong
*someone is butthurt about not being on a list
*the [[Japanese]] muns ask for a new community and it doesn't happen.
*fat muns
*avexasia is mentioned
*museanon is likened to [[/b/]]
