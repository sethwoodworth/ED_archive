'''Interior Crocodile Alligator (I Drive a Chevrolet Movie Theater)''' is the name given to a sound clip of a [[rap]] song that has serious [[potential]] to become the next [[Rickroll]].  Like its predecessor, it's annoying, gets stuck in your head, and is easy to loop onto a misleading [[YouTube]] video. Unlike [[b|Rickroll,]] its awesome and is always funny.

==Wait, what?==
[[You]], the reader, are most likely wondering what the hell this is all about.  Well, it's hard to put into words, so it's [[best]] if you just watch the video.

The idea behind the video/[[meme]]/[[troll]]ing is the same as many others; post a link to a YouTube video in your [[forum]] or message/image board of choice with some sort of [[CP|interesting description]], but intentionally mislead the readers with a link to a video of "Interior crocodile alligator, I drive a Chevrolet movie theater."  Damn, it's a long-ass name, isn't it?  Let's go with '''ICA''' for [[Gary_Coleman|short]].  Bursting onto the YT scene in August of 2008, the meme has already branched out, with several remixes and [[OVER 9000|hundreds of thousands]] of page views from victims.  Also known as the '''Crocroll''', '''Crocodile Roll''', '''Alligator Roll''', and the '''IntCrocAlRoll'''.

An alternative is to simply [[spam]] the phrase on the forum/board until your heart's content - or until you get [[banhammer|banned]], whichever comes first.

My vehicle interior is constructed from a crosswork of reptilian origin, as it is manufactured by Chevrolet it is equipped with a television monitor for which I refer to be as a cinema.

Naturally, the song clip has to have some [[Sauce|source]].  Well, it turns out it's taken from a song (the term is used loosely) by black person '''Chip tha [[Ripper]]'''.  The song itself is a freestyle rap entitled ''S.L.A.B. Freestyle''.  The song's content includes everything that makes Chip Tha Rip a badass, and him having more money than anyone who visits or maintains this site.  The track contains many hilarious lines, ending with the now famous display of lyrical wit, "Interior crocodile alligator, I drive a Chevrolet movie theater." Hear it for yourself.

==Chip tha Ripper's Hobbies==
And as if that wasn't enough, Chip Tha Rip is also an outspoken supporter of [[Voraphilia|cannibalism]]; namely, that of the [[Toddlercon|very young]].  Yes, you read that correctly (or maybe you didn't, how the fuck should anyone know?), [[Dead babies|CHIP THA RIPPER EATS BABIES]]!  Don't believe it?  The proof is in the video:

While [[Some argue|some will argue]] that this is actually Chip Tha Ripper's [[ingeniously clever]] way of saying that he's going to [[I CAME|bust a nut]] in a girl's mouth ("''[[Cum|Babies]]''" for breakfast, "''[[Cum|babies]]''" for dinner. Some believe this is false, saying that chip is gay due to his line below:

{{quote|You fuck with my money, I'm in your ass ([[no homo]]).|Pure badass.}}

One only needs to say that Chip loves pounding men [[in the ass]] to prove that they're a dumbass.

Clearly, one of the baddest rappers ever.
