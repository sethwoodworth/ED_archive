Stormy
[[Image:Syaoronfag.jpg|thumb|Hello, ladies.|right]]

'''Stormy''', aka {{lj|destructively}} / {{lj|vocaloids}} / {{lj|minoctis}} / {{lj|repurika}} / {{lj|idiocracy}} / {{lj|abscond}} / {{lj|alternian}} on the [[Livejournal|Eljay world]], is a notorious [[weeaboo]] who is known for causing all sorts of retarded bullshit in both [[IRL]] and the internet. When he's not trying to [[rape]] the womens over the [[internets|intarwebz]], he's sexually harrassing females of his own species at conventions and/or causing some bullshit drama in LiveJournal [[roleplay]]s. Known to be an open [[homophobe]], rape-obsessed fuckface with a tiny dick, sexist cum wad, and the works. If you catch this bastard, report him to the local authorities ASAP. His real name is Troy, and he is currently going by the name 'Mino'. Be on the lookout.

== Recent Activity ==
As justice was being served at the {{lj|rp_anon_meme}} not too far in the past, exhibit [[faggot]] on the right decided to jump in on a thread about him. He made a [http://rp-anon-meme.livejournal.com/1209.html?thread=1204665#t1204665 speech] of [[butthurt]], directed at "[[fandom]]". Apparently rethinking his fucked up [[shit nobody cares about|logic]], he has at present deleted this. (After, of course, "[[Deleting your LiveJournal|LEAVING LJ FOREVERRRR]]!!!") Naturally, however, the post has been [http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/8751/stormyfagspeechav5.png capped] for your viewing pleasure. Sorry Stormy, CTRL + ALT + DEL can't work for you now.

And he wonders why he's getting [[defriend]]ed? Sry2say you are a loser, boi. 
Of course, his remedy to happiness is [http://img356.imageshack.us/img356/4051/lenyoupussyoe4.png chocolate milk and root beer.]

Be wary, though, he likes to make up personas to win you back! He'll contact you about "things he's heard about you" and so on. Just to try and dupe you into re-adding him, no matter how clear you made it to him you are more than disinterested in friendship. Don't be fooled into trusting him because of his [[attention whore|massive friends list]]. Any mutual friends you have probably don't know who he is since he likes to stalk [[clusterfuck|friending memes]] for fresh blood under his numerous alternate personas. Seriously, don't hesitate to tell them that he is indeed <i>the</i> Stormy. 

Some of his friends still love him, apparently, as evidenced by the crying done over this ED article [http://community.livejournal.com/roleplaysecrets/14879.html?thread=5343263#t5343263 here].

He has recently taken to Bawwing over people not liking him on Ell Jay. This has been met with a resounding WHO THE FUCK CARES by his friends list. Of course, he instantly screens any comments that give him actual advice. You can't be an emo attention whoring faggot with advice!

== History (A Faggot's Tale) ==
Stormy likes to befriend [[women|people]] ([[Nice guy|mostly girls, because that's how creepers work]]). He'll get you no matter how you behave (pleasant, casual, whatever). Then he starts to make you uncomfortable on IM, but you figure "[[virgin|Oh, it's a guy thing, eh?]]" But then, he starts to flirt more blatantly, giving you the creeps. You block him, he throws a shitfit, and turns in to a [[emo|weepy cock]] to win you back. You may or may not give him a second chance, which he'll blow anyway. Usually this occurs as he flounces off/on livejournal with a dramatic flair of faggotry.

It's not until you hear the stories that you start to think, "Wow. This guy is fucking [[pervert|CREEPY]]."  

Stormy has physically stalked at least two people, will gladly meet you at a con if you're female, but will expect you to immediately go suck his dick. If you decline, which you very well should, he will proceed to follow you like a lost puppy and cry. A lot. If you are, for some reason, meeting Stormy at a con, bring male friends with you. They scare him. As far as people he has stalked on livejournal, well, who even knows. He does have a habit of telling friends (how does he have friends?) that the people who remove him "[[lie|can't live without him]]". If you are female and give him your screen name, you will receive [[over 9000]] requests to RP with him. Why, you ask? So he can [[rape|internet fist]] you.

Also, prepare to be deluged by requests for things from him, typically in the form of "Will you buy me a paid account?"

== Usernames ==
[[Image:Tinselfag.jpg|thumb|Who makes hair out of tinsel? Only a [[douchebag]], my friend.|right]] He likes to be a creepy motherfucker and switch them, but his changes are always evident and usually don't last long. He started as {{lj|cursed gamer}}, moved to {{lj|megafighter}} (the account he was originally banned from {{ljcomm|dramadramaduck}} on) before migrating to {{lj|destructively}}. Shit began to follow, and so he escaped to {{lj|vocaloids}}. The catch? He took on the guise of a [[16 year old girl|female]]. Chances are high he will move again, and eyes of a thousand [[anonymous]] will be waiting. Not really. He's not fucking worth that much.  Although, if you tell him that [[anonymous]] is after him, he'll shit bricks. 

{{lj|keysaga}} was a journal he had planned to let blossom into a female gamer named Alaska; as an experiment to see how people would view him in a female persona. To our knowledge? It never came to fruition and he deleted it. (It is sadly a purged name now.)

Most recently, he was RPing at {{ljcomm|amatomnes}} where he had listed his LJ has {{lj|powerofkings}}, claiming to be a girl who likes to rub her boobs in men's faces. But then he flamed the HMD post, and got his sorry ass banned.

The jackass has decided to move on to the world of inksome and fuck up the only roleplay there, [http://www.inksome.com/community/wasteland/profile wastelands]. The fgt's going with the username [http://www.inksome.com/users/seraphim/profile seraphim] and pretending to be called Len. Poor inksome never knew what hit 'em.

He is now currently stalking people on his new LiveJournal {{lj|minoctis}}. BEWARE!

Now he has deleted {{lj|minoctis}} and moved to stalking people on {{lj|repurika}}.  It looks like he's on the hunt for new "friends", too.

'''NEWSFLASH:''' Stormy has apparently deleted {{lj|repurika}} and moved over to {{lj|idiocracy}}. He just doesn't give up.

'''NEWSFLASH MARK II:''' Stormy has been sighted on the social networking site [http://www.plurk.com Plurk] under the username [http://www.plurk.com/fuminori fuminori].

'''NEWSFLASH MARK III:''' Stormy has moved over to {{lj|abscond}}, [[i did it for the lulz|lolologists]] predict wankstorms and heavy bawwwwers once the girls he befriended realize his identity.

== Crimes ==
* [[bestiality|Misuse of animals]], molestation, rape & [[sick fuck|kicking old ladies]]. Oh and guilty of being [[nouglybabies|butt fucking ugly]].
* Attempt to tell people that the way they roleplay their own characters is completely incorrect because it doesn't benefit his characters in any way.
* [[attention whore|Constant begging for attention]].
* Attempts to talk players of [[tits or gtfo|big-busted women]] into [http://timegambler.livejournal.com/810.html rape logs]. Occasionally these characters are [[pedophile|underaged]]--but almost <i>always,</i> the [[16 year old girls|players]] themselves are underaged.
* [http://timegambler.livejournal.com/810.html Strip poker] logs.
* Likewise, if the player is <i>not</i> underaged and actually knows how sex works (i.e., playing hard-to-get as foreplay) he will cry femnazism. Then criticizes. See bullet #2.
* [[Asshat]]tery. 
* <s>Lying on [http://community.livejournal.com/bad_rpers_suck/4420775.html BRPS] and then [http://community.livejournal.com/bad_rpers_suck/4422013.html lying more] when called on his bullshit.</s> BALEETED.
* Contribution to the faggots that attempt to roleplay Light Yagami from [[Death Note]].
* Attempting to play, without [[irony]], the monster from Cloverfield.
* Pretending to be other people to dupe those who have defriended him into adding him again.
* Selling child porn

== Conventions ==
Stormy is often known to frequent conventions in the Greater Toronto Area. If you see this troll coming, run away as fast as your legs will take you. If you are female, any contact will be spent with him staring at your boobs and eventually sexually harassing you. If you are male then he will be freaked the fuck out. Whatever gender you are, he will always ask for money. Cons he has been spotted at are listed as follows:

*Anime North
*Fanexpo
*DTAC
*MTAC

Any cosplay he does will be an instant fail. You can't look that troll-like and expect to pass off as anything other than a troll. If you must approach him, be sure to have an exit strategy prepared beforehand, and a good capacity for verbal vomit. More than half of your brain is expected to melt out of your ears after any given conversation. Please note that he thinks that he is funny, sensitive, and kind. Not bad for a selfish, arrogant, dumbfuck creeper. Post all results of conversations here for epic lulz.


== Roleplays he's banned from ==
In this section, please state RPGs he's been banned from (elaborate explanations are highly encouraged).

* {{ljcomm|amatomnes}} 
** Apparently being a douche/flaming in a crit meme. Played Haruhi Suzumiya ({{lj|anewgoddess}}) and Ashelia B'Nargin Dalmasca ({{lj|skirtchased}}), claiming his OOC journal is {{lj|powerofkings}}. Explanation provided [http://community.livejournal.com/roleplaysecrets/33799.html?thread=13355527#t13355527 here]. Also recently uncovered as the player of Fuminori Sakisaka ({{lj|agnosiating}}).
* {{ljcomm|caketown_high}}
* {{ljcomm|campfuckudie}}
* {{ljcomm|capeandcowl}}
** In their End-September HMD, he: criticized icon-quality, cried butthurt, and pretty much called someone out on not playing their character with his (which resulted in that player dropping immediately after), meanwhile not having an HMD up of his own, and spreading passive-agressiveness all over the place. Quickly banned after [http://community.livejournal.com/roleplaysecrets/131057.html?thread=79856625#t79856625 this secret] on {{ljcomm|roleplaysecrets}}
* {{ljcomm|cpslk_drssngrm}} 
** Possibly containing the best and most epic [[b&]] in the history of [[Livejournal Roleplay|LJ roleplay]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JFp2Yxgx6I]
* {{ljcomm|dramadramaduck}}
** Attempted to initiate sexual logs with every female character in the game (especially Yunalesca), couldn't play worth shit, and was just a huge [[butthurt]] little baby.  He tried to change his name and re-apply, but the mods found him out.  Now he just makes up really obvious [[troll]] journals and joins the OOC comm to cry about how the place is ~*so awful*~ now.
* {{ljcomm|i_s_l_a_n_d_rp}}
* {{ljcomm|kingdom_crack}}
* {{ljcomm|paradisa}}
** He played Mashiro Moritaka ([http://sitsinfront.livejournal.com/ sitsinfront]). Paradisa now has a specific rule that muns must be open about their identities, since he got in by lying to the mods about who he was. It was followed by one of his canonmate players ([http://sitsinback.livejournal.com/ sitsinback]) posting a big bitchy hissyfit in the comm and then leaving, [[delusional| believing the mods banned Stormy for no good reason]]
* {{ljcomm|rivelata}} 
** Banned after spamming the OOC community as a response to one of his [[friends]] being banned for harassing other players and spouting racial slurs like black person. Harassed moderators and players in the game via IM, trying to get them to leave the game. Poorly defended himself on {{ljcomm|roleplaysecrets}}.
* [http://www.inksome.com/community/wasteland/ Wasteland]
** He played Euphemia ([http://www.inksome.com/users/loveandpeace/profile loveandpeace]), Pandora ([http://www.inksome.com/users/asich_ergalion/ asich_ergalion]), Yuffie ([http://www.inksome.com/users/materia/ materia]), Haruhi ([http://www.inksome.com/users/haruhiism/ haruhiism]) and Aigis ([http://www.inksome.com/users/palladion/ palladion]). He was banned, not because he is Stormy as many of the bitches there like to claim, but because he carried on being a douche with players and mods, causing drama when things didn't go his way. Mods should learn not to give faggots like this a second chance.
* {{ljcomm|apocrypha_rp}}
** He played Cierra ([http://overskilling.livejournal.com/ overskilling]) until he backtalked the admin of the comm while trying to weasel his way out of a godmodding punishment. She permabanned him forthwith.
* {{ljcomm|microcosm_rp}}
** Apped under a sock journal and made some players uncomfortable. "Typical Stormy creeper behavior." You would think he'd learn by now.

== Roleplays he's attempted to mod ==
With disastrous results! Any and all RPs he currently mods/used to mod are welcome here.

* {{ljcomm|brofist_tv}}
* {{ljcomm|crackhousedream}}
* {{ljcomm|destined_night}}
* {{ljcomm|kingdom_crack}}
* {{ljcomm|pixelville}}
* {{ljcomm|spacecrafting}}

== Roleplays he's going to terrorize ==
Silly mods, don't you ever learn?

* {{ljcomm|8_dressing}}
* {{ljcomm|bad_touch_farm}}
* {{ljcomm|kingdom_crack}}
* {{ljcomm|kingdomdressing}}
** He goes by "[http://kingdomdressing.pbwiki.com/Len Len]" there, apparently.
* {{ljcomm|pierwalk}}
** He plays Takaya Sakaki ([http://nyxism.livejournal.com/ nyxism]) and Teddie ([http://bearpile.livejournal.com/ bearpile]).
* {{ljcomm|the_love_hotel}}
** Typically seen as Alice ([http://pervette.livejournal.com/ pervette]).
* {{ljcomm|thisisarea42}}
** He plays Minato Arisato ([http://social-links.livejournal.com/ social_links])
* {{ljcomm|polychromatic}}
** He's made a second coming, now playing Hyatt from Excel saga ([http://poorhealth.livejournal.com/ poorhealth])
* {{ljcomm|brofist_tv}}
** He plays, under {{lj|idiocracy}}, Aigis, Ultimo, Teto Kasane and Souji Seta. Calls himself 'Mino'.
* {{ljcomm|gargleblasted}}
** He plays Aegis ([http://shieldheart.livejournal.com/ shieldheart]), Light Yagami ([http://ofgods.livejournal.com/ ofgods]), and previously played Fuminori Sakisaka ([http://agnosiating.livejournal.com/ agnosiating]). He goes by the name 'Bossman.' Many players have already run into trouble with him, but unless he does something big, the mods can't ban him, unfortunately. (Though he has complained to the OOC comm about his posts not getting replies. It means we're learning, you douche.)
*** UPDATE: He has dropped the game. Theorized that he will re-app this game under a new name. Other players are not fooled.
