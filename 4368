'''John Andrew [[Boner|Boehner]]''' (pronounced ''Boner'') is the [[Republican]] House Majority Leader from the state of [[Ohio]] most notable for his [[Guido|orange fake tan]] and constant [[butthurt]] about [[Black Jesus]]'s policies.

Boehner has been there to [[troll]] or [[BAWWWWW]] about everything the Obama Adminstration has done since day one, from the [[Bailout_Plan|Bailout]] to [[Health Care Rage|Healthcare Reform]].  And yet in every visual appearance he seems to look like his mom fucked a carrot to make him exist.

Time and time again, Boehner has argued that President Obama's economic policies are failures.  On August 24, 2010, Boehner suggested that Obama [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/24/AR2010082401483.html fire his economic team and reinstate the Bush Tax Breaks for the wealthy].  To which Obama and everyone who was still unemployed told him to shut the fuck up.


== Political Controversies ==
In June 1995, Boehner provoked contentions of unethical conduct when [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020202571_pf.html he distributed campaign contributions from tobacco industry lobbyists] on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies. Boehner eventually led the effort to change House rules and prohibit campaign contributions from being distributed on the House floor so that next time he did it he wouldn't get caught.
