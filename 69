Founded in 1823 by the well known [[pedophile]] and [[lemonparty]] regular, Eric Gorden Corley, '''''2600''''' is the longest surviving poser magazine in existence. The magazine is published in the zine format, not because it is edgy and hip, as its producers would like you to believe; rather, because it is written for and by [[13-year-old boy]]s and [[faggots]]. Consequently, most of the "content" is a diarrhetic stream of poorly edited articles ranging from "[[Hacking]] [[Walmart]]", to "Hiding Things from Your Parents", to useless verbatim source code (honestly, [[OMG]][[WTF]]BBQ what is this, 1960?), and to the sub-literate letters from ''2600'' readers. 2600 is secretly owned by Barnes & Noble.

''2600'' also infrequently holds [[IRL]] "meet-up" events which they like to tout as a forum to exchange technology and hang out with other [[basement dwellers]], where the height of the festivities are a grand circle jerk during which they whistle a 2600hz tone. Unbeknownst to the attendees, these meetings are really just an opportunity for the [[feds]] to take everyone's picture and put them on watch lists. These gatherings further prove that ''2600'' members are in fact unskilled script kiddies and not real [[hackers]], because a real hacker would never openly admit they are one.

== Not So Secret Info ==

''2600'' meets on the first Friday of every month in the food court of the old citicorp building in New York City (the one that looks like it's on stilts because they had to build it around some church that was there). Caution: most ''2600'' members are also trekkies and matrix fags. Do not approach unless you're doing it for the lulz.

== The Early Days ==

Unlike what could be gathered from the homogenized aftermath, the pre-1990 ''2600'' was a great magazine. It featured nearly unreadable [[emo|angsty and punkish]] articles, by guys with cool [[BBS]] nicks along with demos in [[phreak]]ing phones and early [[Unix|UNIX]] systems [[Old media|Bell and AT&T]] used at the time. It resembled [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]]. ''This is a good thing'' since it made internet the haven for stringe pornography, shady forums and imageboards it is today. Without these fucked up teenage losers, the internet would be known as some boring corporate Disney Land.

What we fail to realize is how hard it was to get any good information before [[Google]] and [http://www.milw0rm.com milw0rm]. what remains of ''2600'' with the cons and [[usenet]] groups, [[IRC]] channels and [[FAQ|tutorials]] is nothing but the radioactive afterglow of what was once the flagship for a great movement.

== The [[Video Game]] Console ==

'''2600''' is also the greatest video game machine ever made, first released by [[Atari]] in 1977. It is also the most [[emo]] approved system ever made, and if you find a 2600 at a restaurant, club, or any other hangout, emo people are sure to be near.  2600 t-shirts also make you cool. Still, you don't have to be emo to like it - and you can find lots of emolators on the net for all your 2600 needs. Of course, an emolator isn't as cool as the real thing in all its vintage plastic glory.

== Typical Table of Contents ==
Every issue of 2600 is completely the same as the last, each repeating information that may at one time have been relevent to computers, but by the time it hits the B&N shelves, is outdated . Below is an example issue:

*'''Cover''' - features an [[unfunny|ironic]] picture with subliminal [[iphone|phone]] company advertising.
*'''Pay Phones''' - Because we don't have these in our pockets now. Complete with half assed captions underneath, reiterating information that can also be found by glancing at the photo of the pay phone. 
*'''Hacker's Perspective''' - will usually be written by an aging [[Old|bluehair]] with little to no computer literacy, claiming he has been a hacker since he started [[cool story bro|stealing wires from Jeeps in WW2]].
*'''Advertisement for 2600 Shirts''' - nothing says [[douche|hacker]] like a polo with 2600 embroidered on it. 
*'''How To''' - which barely qualify as how to's, because there is only so many times you can be taught basic commands for Nmap.
*'''[[shameless self promotion|Advertisement for Club Mate]]'''- 2600 doesn't make money from advertisements, so be sure to buy their [[irony|$40 six packs of soda]] for your [[circle jerk|2600 meetings]]. 
*'''Discussion Time''' - In real magazines, this would be the Letters Column, but at 2600, this  is nothing but letters written by [[13 year old boys|12 year olds]] and [[India|Indians]], asking how to get articles published. Emmanuel JewGoldstien feels the need to respond to these, even though there is an advertisement on just about every other page explaining how to submit articles for publication.
*'''Advertisement for a 2600 Subscription''' - which costs [[logic|more]] than buying the magazine at Newstand Prices.
*'''Coding Article''' - Article that teaches how to [[1337|make a calculator]] with Visual Basic, with the entire code printed out, and a notice that you can also download the code already typed online. 
*'''Marketplace''' - advertisements for [[television|Super Haxx0r Universal Remotes]], with more advertisements for [[jenkem|Club Mate]] dispersed evenly.
*'''Meetings''' - Just in time to read about all the 2600 meetings scheduled for three weeks ago.
*'''Pay Phones''' -Just in case you missed the first four.
*'''Back Cover Photos''' - Pictures of buildings whose [[USI|address happens to be 2600]].
