==Islam is the Light==
{{quote|Islam is the light.|From The Mouths of Plastic Babes}}

In October of 2008, '''Rachel Jones''', [[white trash|an All-American Mom from Indiana]], purchased Jew "[[Loli|Little Mommy]] Real Loving Baby [[Toddlercon|Cuddle & Coo]] Doll" for her children.  Soon thereafter, she heard the toy say with its artificial lips, '''"Islam Is The Light"'''.


She was [[shocked and appalled]]. From there, word spread like [[fire|wildfire]].  It wasn't long before every single [[Christian]] fundamentalist, [[Alex Jones|crackpot]], and helicopter-mom in the [[dumbfuckistan|country]] swarmed to to unleash their [[batshit insane|righteous]] fury in the name of the [[raptor Jesus|Lord]].

==[[This_is_why_we_can't_have_nice_things|This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things]]==

Like rotten-fish-guzzling seagulls behind a Polish fishing trawler, [[Fox News]]'s van was the first to scream up to the scene of the hate-crime. Like a good [[troll|news station]] they then proceeded to repeat the "hate statement" [[over 9000]] times over the course of the 4-minute report on it.

The fanatics thus began their [[lemon party|feeding frenzy]].

In an uncharacteristic [[win|display of courage/brains]], the stores stocking the toy refused to recall the first wave of shipped dolls in [[Obama]]'s evil subversive plot to turn all our children into [[emo|deranged]], violent [[terrorists]]. The resulting cyclone of [[bawwwww]] caused by the legions of [[moralfags|raw-burger-faced meddling trailer-moms]] squawking that the toy was "spouting hatred" would have been the end of the story - funny, but not really [[lulz]]. 


That is, until early 2009, when Jones [[asking for it|innocently]] purchased the [[Nintendo]] DS game ''[[Chris Hansen|Baby Pals]]'' for her daughter.

That's right. [[irony|The same mom]] and the same kid. Apparently, the game used the same sound-file as the dolls.  Thus, Rachel Jones again became [[rage|incensed]] when she heard, from the speakers of her child's portable [[video game]] system, '''"Islam Is The Light"'''.

Crave Entertainment, which publishes Baby Pals, has responded to [[attention whore|Rachel Jones]]'s [[BAWW|concerns]].

{{quote|<small>In creating the Nintendo DS game “Baby Pals”, the game developer Brain Toys / InXile used sounds files to simulate the life like baby noises and babbling.  The sounds are publicly available for license. It is a recording of a 5 month old baby babbling non-intelligible phrases. In over 200 hours of testing the product, no recognizable English words or phrases were discernible.  

The sound in question of this babble may sound like the words night, right or light, but it is only coincidence as the baby recorded was too young to pronounce these words let alone a whole grammatically correct phrase.

We at Crave Entertainment and InXile regret that there was any misinterpretation of the baby noises and in no way have intentionally put any words or phrases into the baby sounds.

We hope this eases any concerns and fans continue to enjoy playing the game.</small>|''[[pussy|Doug Panter]] of Crave Entertainment, exposing himself to the world only to reveal that he has no testicles.''}}

==So What The Fuck Happened?==

Good question. Some claim it to be proof of the [[Weev|evil Islamic conspiracy.]] Some, less [[retarded|prosaic]], think that a [[Anonymous|merry prankster]] working for three dollars an hour making [[oh exploitable|exploitica]] for idiots decided to slip the sound sample into the game to see if anyone would notice.

[[Some argue|Others think]] that the [[Truth|interpretation is subjective]] and that it's [[Lulz|a random assortment of notes]]. [[Flame War|Some argue]] that if you search for something in you will find it, [[Time Paradox|even if it isn't there.]]

Had [[Jack Thompson]] not been disbarred, he'd have a field day pointing out the moral poisons contained in video gaming.

Mattel Corporation has released a[http://www.shareholder.com/mattel/downloads/10-13-08_Media_Statement_re_Cuddle_and_Coo_Dolls.pdf press statement], effectively [[lie|denying]] that they [[did it for the lulz]].  

For [[anon|our]] part, we can only take it as proof that [[God]]/[[Allah]]/[[Jacknstock]] was real, and that he loves the [[Lulz]].
