Olchai
{{potential}}

[[Image:OldChild.jpg|thumb|Most Olchai have their rooms decorated with [[Toys|retarded Plushies]]. Please note that they will defend their toys with their lives.]]

An '''Olchai''' (Also known as: "''Old Child''" or "''[[Manchild]]''") is the opposite of a Young Adult. Olchai are [[Teenager|Teenagers]] or [[Adult|Adults]] that have the interests and behaviors of a [[Child]]. They are known for spending their free time watching Cartoons, admiring [[toys]] (such as Action Figures/Dolls) and reading [[comic books]]. Most Olchai tend to think that they are just "reliving [[Shit nobody cares about|childhood memories]]" or "[[Faggotry|being a kid at heart]]". An Olchai develops when the person (Usually when they are 15 or older) forms thoughts that the pleasurable reward of being an [[Adult]] is a [[lie]] and will claim that driving, working, doing [[drugs]], [[golf]] and having [[sex]] is boring. They are usually [[Chris-chan|social outcasts]] due to the fact that a chick will not [[fuck]] a guy playing with beanie babies.

==Types of Olchai==

There are two types of Olchai in existence:

===Primary===
[[Image:SpongebobGuy.jpg|thumb|A Typical Olchai. He can also be a potential [[Pedophile]].]]

'''Primary Olchai''' is the earliest stage of this [[Disease]]. They will usually range from 14 to 18 years of age. Most of them are consist of [[Anime]] fans. Their hangouts are [[devianTART]], [[Sheezyart]], [[JewTube]] and [[Fur Affinity|Fag Affinity]]. They enjoy [[crap]] like [[YouTube Poop]], [[Spongebob]], [[Naruto]], [[Pokemon]], [[Digimon]], [[Sonic the Hedgehog]], Tom & Jerry, and Transformers: The Animated Series.

===Advanced===
'''Advanced Olchai''' is the most severe case due to the chances that his [[Wife]] will want a divorce when she finds him having a [[LOL WUT|Tea Party with a stuffed animal]] and that he will eventually become a [[Pedophile]]. Their age is mostly 19 and up. They tend to be extremely secretive about their ways because if their family knows about it, their neighbors will find out. When their neighbors find out, everyone in the town will know. When the town knows, the family will be the laughingstock of the whole Country. Some will go to any lengths to hide their Olchaihood by even faking their name and age, so it is best to stay away from people on the [[internet]] that say that they are a 6 year old that plays with [[Shit|Dolls]] when they are actually 48.

Even after “F.T.” says that her errant beau likes to watch the “‘adult’ ones at night” - presumably Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim - Brothers leads off her response: “It is certainly reasonable to be puzzled by seeing a grown man - a professional, no less - howling at cartoons meant for a 6-year-old.| Emru Townsend}}

==Trolling an Olchai==

They can be [[trolled]] in various ways:

* Tell them that they need to grow up.
* Say that their [[Cartoon]] [[Fanart]] sucks.
* Ask them why they waste their life on [[Pokemon]] and Scooby Doo.
* Say that [[Golf]] is the best [[sport]] in the [[world]].
* Say that Cartoon Network, [[Nickelodeon]], [[4Kids]] TV or [[Disney]] Channel is stupid.
