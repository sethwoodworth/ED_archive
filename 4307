Jesus Tortilla
[[Image:OG jesus tortilla.gif|thumb|The original Jesus tortilla]]

[[Last Thursday]], some [[batshit]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|lady]] from [[New Mexico]] was [[Mexican|making breakfast for her 12 children]] when Jesus himself decided to send her a message.  Instead of [[Schizophrenia|talking to her]], or [[Goatse|performing a kind act]], he instead felt that the only way to get through to her was to appear right before her very eyes...on a tortilla!  And even though [[noone]] really knows [[Black|what Jesus looks like]], and people will believe in ANYTHING, it was truly a genuine honest-to-god miracle of epic proportions.  

This meant it was high time to shell out some cash, and start praying to a piece of flat bread.  Truly, our [[God]] is an [[Fake|awesome]] God.  Ever since then, people everywhere have been finding Jesus on various food items, in windows, and anywhere else that someone in need of your money happens to be.

==[[No|Do You Believe in Miracles?]]==
Some may ask - why tortillas? Well, as [[bitches don't know]], Jesus claimed during the last supper that the bread was his [[Cock|body]]. And, like suckers, people believed him.  It should also come as no surprise that as a Jew, Jesus would be [[holocaust|toasted over and over again]].

==Spinoffs==
Some people also claim to see the Virgin Mary in a similar fashion.  However, she isn't as popular as Jesus, or nearly as profitable, because everyone knows that Catholics [[Spics|don't ]] [[Irish|have]] [[Guidos|money]].

==Other Religious Apparitions==
Of course this phenomenon isn't isolated to just Christians.  People of all religious persuasions are crazy enough to believe in this shit.

==Selling Religion on eBay for Fun and [[Profit|Prophet]]==

[[Image:Mary toast.jpg|thumb|left|Of course it's the Virgin Mary.  If it's not Jesus then there's only one other thing it could be, logically speaking.]]

[[Image:Allahfish.jpg|thumb|Jesus toast (with a bite taken out of it) sold for approx. £15,000. The Allah fish [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/4667610.stm sold for only £10.]]]

In [[America]] (where else?) a piece of toast depicting an image of the virgin Mary has sold for $28,000 on [[eBay]]. Not only is this toast a decade (yes, 10 YEARS) old but as [[you]] can see someone has taken a bite out of it. This leads us to conclude:

# [[Americans]] are a breed of fanatics who see religion everywhere
# Americans are [[retards]] who will throw money at this religious fanaticism
# Americans not only see something that is clearly not valuable as being worth a lot of money, they are so fucking greedy they will still eat it. That bite probably [[Fail|knocked $10,000 off the selling price]].

==DIY Jesus Toast==

[[Image:Jesus pan.jpg|thumb|make your own miracle!]]


Tired of waiting for the Almighty to bless your breakfast? Well no matter because now you can make your very own Jesus toast! Methods include:

* Cutting butter into the shape of the almighty and putting it under the grill. Results suck.
* Using a laser to burn in the details. Unless you find some poor bastard to sell the toast to, the laser will simply cost too much.
* Prayer.  SPOILER: this never works for anything whatsoever, let alone magical burned bread.
* [[????]]
* [[PROFIT]]*

<small>*Note: there isn't a prophet joke here because neither Jesus nor Mary were prophets. If you should get the image of a real prophet on your bread, then tough shit. Nobody cares about them.</small>
