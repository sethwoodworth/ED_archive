There are [[bullshit|several theories]] as to when "too lazy" was born. Some people say that "Too lazy" was born when [[SchmuckyTheCat]] created the world [[last thursday]], but the most widely accepted theory is that it happened around last friday when Schmucky was asked to make [[MOAR|more]], but [[Confirm/deny|denied]] because he was "too lazy".<br> <br> 

Another popular theory is that "too lazy" is a variant of "too tired". "Too tired" was [[some argue|indisputably]] created by Adam when his first wife, Lilith, asked if she could be on top. He promptly told her that he was "too tired" and went to sleep. After three nights of Adam being "too tired", Lilith caught on and divorced him.
