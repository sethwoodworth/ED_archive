'''CATS''' is a sad old wigger who spends [[at least 100]] hours a day browsing the [[Dragonball Z]] article at Wikipedia. His only moments of power come when he’s performing his role as an admin on this website. He spent several months in and out of psychiatric units due to his utter worthlessness. Nurse [[Girlvinyl]] cured him by giving him the power of the [[Banhammer]] on æ. It's only a matter of time before he does something monumentally stupid that gets him [[user:Jacknstock|Jacknstocked]] from the site.
