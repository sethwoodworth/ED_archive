[[Image:Deletionpedia.jpg|frame|right|Even h2g2bob can't work out if it starts with "D" or "d" (see "Dord", LOL).]]
If the Wikipedia is a pile of [[Pelican Shit|pelican shit]], then [http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/ '''Deletionpedia'''] is a new kind of [[retard|special]] [[wiki]], a kind of strange partner site for [[Simple Wikipedia|Special Wikipedia]]. While Special Wikipedia's specialty is stupidity, Deletionpedia's is stupefying readers by picking up only the [[antilulz|dullest]] parts of the [[crap|birdshit]] that offended some system-gaming [[wikipedo]]'s [[Neutral point of view|PoV]] and so got deleted from the [[Wikipedia]]. One would think that this might be a [[lulz]]y practice, until one realizes that Deletionpedia's policies mean the pages archived there are 100% [[shit nobody cares about]]. 

Deletionpedia also serves as a weird vanity site for the many obscure sports teams and events, bands, [[batshit insane]] political theories etc. that [[Wikipedia|TOW]]'s [[cabal]] members and their sycophants didn't like, so with a bit of nattering in [[wikipedese]], cast them out from their set of articles on obscure sports teams and events, bands, [[batshit insane]] political theories etc.

Nobody can edit deletionpedia, making it no real [[wiki]] at all. It doesn't claim to be a real wiki, so does have some kind of mild but creepy [[Wikipedian]]-[[troll]] value vs. the people who posted the articles (most articles are a mess) on TOW in the first place: '''''HA, HA HA, you can't edit it on ''Deletionpedia'', fuck you for making this crap'''''. Strangely, there's less [[fanboi]] [[fail]] than [[you]] might expect. The few deleted bits that aren't on deletionpedia must all be "[[notable]]"! OMG maybe some of the rest is on this very site, like this article about [[Professional Wrestling|pro "wrestling"]]!!1!

Deletionpedia does run on [[Wikimedia]] software, has [[AotN]]'s and other wikifeatures (excepting lookup, most are useless because only the [[Dying alone|solitary]] [[sysop]], [[bureaucratic fuck|Wikipedia administrator]] [[Wikipedia:User/h2g2bob|h2g2bob]] can use them). Some are pretty strange, like the login screen that outdoes [[Wikitruth]] by being open to just one person.

Deletionpedia should have been more closely watched early on, because the policies weren't always as [[fail]] as they are now. One sham [[wikicide]] from [[TOW]] [[whine]]d about the site when nobody much was noticing it, possibly influencing the [[fail]] of deletionpedia and drawing the [[Arbcom]]'s attention.

Truly a festival of [[fail]].

==Foundation==
[[Deletionpedia]] was founded by [[Bureaucratic Fuck|wikipedia admin]] [[Wikipedia:User/h2g2bob|h2g2bob]] (srsly wikipedian but a real [[Neckbeard|neckbeard]] type, so not one of the worst) in April of 2008. It doesn't have any earlier articles&mdash;even if it did, they wouldn't be the good (deleted) ones.

==Why it's up==
Wikipedoes like to feel that what they are doing is very [[serious business]], and most are [[My Little Pony|showpony]] [[moron]]s, point pushers, or a combination of the two, so they invented a [[top|deletionist]]&ndash;[[bottom|inclusionist]] controversy as a technique to generate further [[drama]] within their  [[cult]]. 

Until a few months before the [[Essjay]] scandal, [[TOW]] still tolerated a [[lame]] but living series of pages called "Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense" (BJaODN), a relic of days when TOW allowed some sense of fun and hadn't been completely taken over by [[IRL]] bureaucrats and lawyers. The [[bureaucratic fuck]]s never totally won the war over deleting BJaODN, but made endless [[AFD]]s, talked endless crap to try for it, and cut out most of the few really good parts. 

[[Wikipedia:User/h2g2bob|H2g2bob]] made Deletionpedia to catch the deleted stuff and recapture the spirit of BJaODN and the many [[vandal]] histories once hosted on [[TOW]], but found being [[wikipedian]] more important than [[freedom]] in this case, so limited the catching to the [[crap]]. He was also way too late to catch any of the tiny portion of great bits from BJaODN because they were all deleted and the idea was frozen before Deletionpedia came to be. Only about 1% of BJaODN was interesting. TOW now has [[tl;dr|boring as hell]] archival pages. The spirit of BJaODN at its worst became [[unfunnypedia]] a few years back.

As a good little [[Pirate Bay|freetard]], H2g2bob isn't willing to pay for any of this himself, so the site has [[advertisements]].

==What deletionpedia is==
===The idea===
The idea is to be a [[Facepalm|sop]] to extreme inclusionists ([[Unwarranted self importance|"my every thought and every place I walk by deserves an article"]]), people who have ideas well outside any mainstreams, and [[retard]]ed folk, if any happen to make articles that are outside the [[TOW]] norms and then get deleted. 

===How it works===
[[Image:Deletionpedia somehow takes you into the future.png|thumb|right|300 px|Deletionpedia undermines the fabric of space&ndash;time.]]
H2g2bob made a bot that checks for the deletion templates and uploads articles tagged with them. H2g2bob checks to see if the articles have really been deleted, and then checks the ones that have been deleted against his [[antilulz|no-fun]] and [[politically correct]] policies, and probably with the [[Arbcom]] at times. This eliminates any chance of entertainment. Fact is, the bot can't run without permission from [[Jimbo]] and the [[WMF]].

====[[Antilulz]] Policies====
The Deletionpedia has five [[do not want]] policies, ensuring it [[Do not want|does not host]] the pick of the deleted bunch.  
#No copyright violations even if it's fair use 
#No attack or libel pages
#No pages with revision history still [[own]]ed by Wikipedia or other WMF sites
#No pages that might [[Offensive|offend]] someone.
#No [[docs]]

====Why they suck====
# This sucks because it undermines a good principle (fair use).
# Part is reasonable for a site administrator but define "attack". Public figures are fair game at times. [[Political correctness]] and what [[Wikipedia Jews]] want people to believe usually dictate what is not acceptable in the [[WMF]] world. 
# This is only reasonable if the revision histories on the [[WMF]] sites produced a better result. 
# Utter fail. Some of the [[batshit insane]] political-social articles that are on Deletionpedia would offend some people. Then again, just about anything you find will now have some moron revelling in [[BAW|"I am offended"]].
# This should depend on how avidly the person is self-publicizing

Why Deletionpedia doesn't host [[Chris-chan]]'s [http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?search=Christian+Weston+Chandler&go=Go  Wikipedia page] is a mystery, probably a combination of two, four and five, but none of them apply since Chris wanted the page.

Deletionpedia gets about 2/5 for policy.

====More limits====
Deletionpedia has two more ''de facto'' policies because of the bot's limitations and a [[do not want]] to solve them due to the other five: not necessarily any images, and no discussion pages. H2g2bob claims to be working on [[pwn|grabb]]ing the discussion pages to get [[moar]] [[Vespene gas]] and [[win]] at [[Starcraft]] (right now, [[TOW]] is pushing Deletionpedia as an offshoot into a license violation by changing the terms mid-stream with no consent from users, eliminating the need for discussion pages, but h2g2bob will probably still think about this and try to do it). 

===Content===
Interestingly, h2g2bob escaped from [[Nethack|the neckbeard game]] long enough to make a detailed article about [[Warcraft]] weapons for a single team into one of the few triumphs on Delepee, carefully extracting all of the lovingly hand-made sketches of weapons some [[lolcow]] drew for the WMF under the [[GFDL]] with no thought of value. As of June 2009, there are [http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Special:Imagelist a few hundred pictures on the site.] Some will be of interest to [[lulz]]ers.

====Quality====
Most of the pages on deletionpedia were made by [[retard|simpletons]] and never much cleaned up before they got [[baleet]]ed, so reading them is pretty [[Worst picture ever|excruciating]]. 

====Quantity====
Deletionpedia grew explosively for a while, going from fewer articles than ED in early May of 2009 to almost 70,000 in mid-June of the same year. The Wikipedia's roving anti-[[lulz]] agent [[Alison]] noticed the site during this phase, then started [[whine|whin]]ing about it to H2g2bob, her buddies at the [[Arbcom]], and [[Wikipedia Review|a bunch of lame obsessives]] who welcome her fellow [[bureaucratic fuck]]s. Site was cleaned up and frozen shortly thereafter. Dates are hard to calculate exactly because H2g2bob created an offset to [[2012]]. Its 63,074 article pages (and total of over 120,000) are likely all it will ever have.

====Oddities====
[[Fail]] as it is, Deletionpedia has a few oddities and even some articles in the range of ED interests. This is a pretty random list

*[http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=List_of_Jewish_jurists_(deleted_10_May_2008_at_06:22) A list of Jewish jurists], something [[PoetGuy]] was into, but this seems to be from an earlier series of fights. Does feature a couple of edits from [[Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters]], e-enemy of the [[PoetGuy]]/[[Blissyu2]] complex.
*[http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Scooter_(Roller_coasters)_(deleted_09_May_2008_at_15:57) Scooter, a rollercoaster]. Surely a rollercoaster is noteworthy? Oh no, it was just a hoax. Do want to ride it!
*[http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=FlyBosnia_(deleted_16_Jun_2008_at_17:32) Bosnian Airlines] is typical useless crap.
*[http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Anal_torture Anal torture] a crappy stub, also in [[PoetGuy]] territory, but no contributions from there.
*[http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Homosexuality_and_transgender_%28deleted_29_Jul_2008_at_16:12%29 Someone's strange private theory.]
*[http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Naziphobia_%28deleted_13_Jul_2008_at_23:15%29 Naziphobia] is odd but [[tl;dr]].
*[http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Jewish_navy_%28deleted_09_Aug_2008_at_18:53%29 Jewish navy] is about a [[terrorist]] group.

==What Deletionpedia Does and Why TOW Supported It==
Until Deletionpedia, TOW administrators giving out copies of deleted articles was acceptable in theory but in practice this depended on who gave what to whom. 

Still, it happened, produced occasional bans, requests by email were alright, the results were [[lulz]]y on occasion, and the Wikipedia was totally inconsistent about who could or couldn't do it (except that it was and is always OK for [[Wikipedia Jews]]). Classic [[whine]]r [[Everyking]], a former [[bureaucratic fuck|TOW admin]] who gave out [[shit nobody cares about|stuff nobody cares about]] spent almost three years in [[butthurt]] [[whine|whining]] about his very brief ban for giving out a deleted article on the [[Wikipedia Review]], even though he was still able to [[cum|dump his load]] on the Wikipedia over most of that time.

With Deletionpedia, the [[cabal]]s were briefly able to say "Want a deleted article? They're all on Deletionpedia. Except the ones that were fucked or we just didn't like." H2g2bob doesn't seem like the kind to knowingly go along with it, but this was an effect of Deletionpedia and the reason he got permission to run the bot and make the site for a little while.
