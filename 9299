An [[Old|ancient]], [[unfunny]] meme used by [[idiot]]s to determine the source of [[fail]] in anyone who's fucked-up enough to disagree with them. The use of "'''You must have been abused as a child'''" and variants thereof indicates extreme [[butthurt]] in those who type it. This meme peaked in popularity during the mid-'70s and is still used by [[NORP]]s, [[luser]]s and other incarnations of faggotry.

I honestly think you should be placed in a museum to be observed and discussed. Groups of phychologists need to study your means of rationale, and somehow fathom how you "evolved" in the direction you did. '''You must have been abused as a child''' to end up this way...I'm so sorry for you.|Chris, [http://huffandblow.com/2006/07/global-warming-the-libertarian-approach-000062.html because somebody is concerned about] [[global warming]]|Taildragrrrrr --- grrrr, ey ?

What would you do without the internet? Wait in the park like a creepy old man until you overhear someone misuse a word or pronounce something wrong and then pounce on them? '''Were you abused as a child?''' Does something give you the need to act out like an internet troll? Itâ€™s pretty sad. But, you seem to be happy in that role.

==Well, Actually...==
Strangely enough, if it turns out that the recipient really was abused as a child, the people arguing with them [[troll's remorse|suddenly become very meek and apologetic]].

On the other hand, real trolls will [[prove me wrong|demand proof of said abuse]]. By this stage, everybody else will type in messages saying what a cruel heartless bastard this troll is (complete with angry emoticons), even though it's very likely that the person claiming to be traumatized because [[daddy]] used to stick [[Cock|umbrellas]] up their asses is a complete bullshitter, because people who genuinely have been abused do not [[attention whore|brag about it on the internet]].
