Jedi Church
[[image:Jedichurchlogo.gif|right]]

The '''Jedi Church''' was started [[last Thursday]] by a [[New Zealand|sheep-fucker]] who was sick of being forced to enter a [[religion]] on his census form and, rather than starting a [[LJ|whiney protest blog]] about it, decided to make [[lulz]] of the situation instead. He demanded of his government that [[Jedi]] be recognised as a faith, as [[bullshit|everyone has the right to their own beliefs.]] According to legend, an email was sent back to him stating that if 8000 people would call themselves disciples of the Jedi, it would be recognized.

As with [[Scientology]], the [[lulz]] backfired. Within a week [[over 9000|53715]] [[fat]] [[geeks]] who go to [[Star Wars]] conventions to argue with Liam Neeson about how Lightsabers work had crawled out of the woodwork. (Note: not a hypothetical anecdote. Neeson himself has complained in interviews that this actually fucking happens.)

Of course, the whole thing [[fail|fell flat on it's fucking face.]] Too late, the [[basement dwellers|younglings]] found out that being "Recognized" does not actually mean anything on paper and that they will be "Recognized but not counted" by [[the man]]. Nonetheless they continue to fight for Jedi rights to this day... and the lulz are strong with these ones.

{{Quote|Is the Jedi religion fiction?|LOL, yes.}}

{{Quote|Several other religions openly admit that their text is not the word of God, and that it is only a prescribed behavior or a philosophy of life (e.g. Buddhism, Scientology).|Uh-oh.}}

{{Quote|The Jedi religion is just like the Sun, it existed before a popular movie gave it a name, and now that it has a name, people all over the world can share their experiences of the Jedi religion, here in the Jedi Church.|We have just lost cabin pressure.}}

Having had their asses handed to them in by a chav with a crutch in a black trash bag and reduced to whimpering basement dwellers once more, the Dark Side of the force prevailed.
