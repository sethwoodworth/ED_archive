John Skelton
[[Image:Skelton Will Rape.jpg|thumb|Even though he has [[internet disease]], John Skelton is still ugly as [[Shitting dick nipples|sin]].]]

John Skelton (AKA Duckula, Duckula85, etc.) is a [[13-year-old boy|22-year-old]] [[basement-dweller|socialite]] that spends all his time on [[bebo|very]] [[MySpace]] [[something awful|endeavours]]. 

== John Skelton Wishes He could Rape You ==

John Skelton really wishes that he could [[rape]] you, but he spends all his time on [[social networking]] sites ([[internet stalking]]), making bad [[Adobe® Photoshop®|shoops]] for [[Something Awful]] and raping his [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|HUGE]] action figure collection (and his [[cock|penis]] is so small he can only satisfy the 3" figures).

== Marvel Fetish ==
John loves Comic Book day in Aberdeen. He visits Forbidden Planet every 5 minutes to see if they've arrived yet.

He regularly spends all his [[Your Mom|mom's]] earnings on [[shit]] like: The Avengers, The New Avengers, The Avengers Vs [[Spiderman]], The Avengers Vs [[Chin-chan]] and so on. He has to keep buying new copies of everything, because the pages keep getting stuck together from all the [[cum|jizz]] he gets on them from [[masturbation|masturbating]] to closeups of [[Spiderman]]'s [[cock|bulge]].  

== Internet Stalking ==

If your name appears below, John Skelton has [[bookmark|bookmarked]] and checks every hour, on the hour, your [[Bebo]], [[MySpace]] and any other [[retard|retarded]] piece of [[shit]] form of [[social networking]] site that you may belong to. Right now, he is [[masturbation|masturbating]] to your profile by slowly rubbing a Captain America action figure up and down his [[cock]].
