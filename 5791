[[Image:Nipples_removed_to_save_bandwidth.jpg|thumb|This is how you save [[bandwidth]]]]
In order to avoid clogging the [[Internets|series of tubes]] that are the Internets, measures had to be taken. [[Basement-dweller|Experts]] have determined that is was possible to save [[over 9000]] Kilobytes per image file simply by removing nipples from it. 

Despite being a very effective way to conserve bandwidth, removing nipples is actually listed in the [[DSM IV|DSM IV]] as a [[Fetish|sexual fetish]]. It's also a way for male virgins to unite their three greatest passions in life : [[Masturbation]], masturbation while [[This Looks Shopped|photoshopping]] pictures of girls and [[b/|multiplayer masturbation]].
