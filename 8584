Turtle Punch
{{Forced Meme}}
Turtle Punch is a meme that is rumored to have started in the game Crysis [[at least 100 years ago]].  [[script kiddies|l33t haxxors]] discovered that punching a turtle ([[shit nobody cares about|in actuality, a Mediterranean Tortoise]]) would kill the player and, after a series of semantic changes which experts still debate, the phrase "turtle punch" entered in common use to denote a [[suicide|seemingly harmless]] activity which has [[anti-lulz|dire and unforeseen consequences]].
