'''Seth MacFarlane''' is an arrogant prick who [[13 year old boys]] worship for his [[Family Guy|immature potty humor driven shows]], college students worship for his [[leftard|mainstream liberal/anti religious driven claims]], and that [[16 year old girl|insecure girls]] worship for his [[Homosexuality|love of musicals and pretty boy face.]] He took typical scenarios and skits, made them offensive and anti social,labeled it all as an "animated tv show" and has since expanded the empire 3x over with an almost mindless fan base serving as an ego for it all. Think of him like the [[Shane Dawson]] of [[Television]] with singing and politics added to the faggotry.

==Early Career==
It should be noted Seth MacFarlane has no creativity (or talent for this matter) when it comes to thinking up and designing an animated series. The animation and character design is bland and the ideas are recycled to the point where you only have to watch two five minute segments of one of his shows to realize this. The attention and budgets he gets for his shows and so called "work" greatly upsets [[John K|other cartoonists]].He started his career of trolling the animation industry at [[Cartoon Network]] where he put out his first made for TV short film titled "The Life of Larry". Now [[Some Argue|some say]] that this was perhaps the highlight of his career. For the characters actually looked well designed and had some personality. Sadly, Seth just couldn't bare the fact there are [[Republicans]] in the world and thus was always managing to stir up some [[Serious Business|highly controversial rants with his co-workers]]. This greatly got on the nerves of everyone else at Cartoon Network for [[Olchai|they just wanted to STFU about it all and draw some FUCKING CARTOONS GOD DAMNIT!!!!11]]

==''[[Family Guy]]''==
[[Image:FamilyGuyep.jpg|thumb|Typical episode of Family Guy.]]
Fed up of his [[Bawww|constant rants about the government]] and overall unlikeableness, Cartoon Network made the obvious decision and [banhammered] his ass out of there. [[Butthurt]] over the fact he just got [[pwnd]] by [[Cartoon Network|The Man]], Seth thought he would [[Cheating|use the ideas he sold off to them to make a show of his own, only he would modify the characters and plot a bit, and throw in a few adult situations]]. This was later known as [[Family Guy]]. Now, [[some argue|some say]] he just ripped off the Simpsons, but this is not true, since it is widely known Matt Groening just took his time machine into the future, saw Seth's success and empire, and thought he would just [[Theft|take a slice of the pie.]]

==''American Dad''==
After seeing the obvious success of Family Guy due to the Y2K aftermath of 13 year old boys. Seth decided it just wasn't enough. He needed to get his oh so valid facts out that [[Republicans]] and [[Christian|hard working religious families]] are the root all EVIL!!!11 And more money and attention, DUH! That's when he took Family guy, changed the dad to a stereotype of [[Conservative|EVERY evil person in the world]], and thus, American Dad was shat out.
Believe it or not, this is actually just a fraction better then Family Guy, for it lacks the constant [[unfunny]] cutaways and flashbacks that 
act as the Hershey Kiss cherry on top of his other [[Family Guy|steaming pile of dog crap]]. This time, not only the 13 year old boys came for more, but EVERY single college student joined the religion as well. Because the very mature and unimpulsive college students understood that [[Daddy]] telling them to turn off the xbox, get off their asses, and actually work for once in their life is the absolute reason why they are in debt and lost all their friends to drunk driving.

==''The Cleveland Show''==
OMG, AGAIN! This time Seth needed an excuse for his blatant racism and insensitivity. So, what better way to do it then dedicate a show to black people? I mean, that makes you totally [[not racist]]. Right? So, anyway, Seth MacLazyass not only just took the family guy characters, and inked their skin darker, he took a character from his [[Family Guy|other show]] and made him the dad to save him some time on inking. That's right, just took him out of one show, and plopped into the driver seat of another. It's called a spin off. STUPID! Seth now has three shows, which are essentially all the same, and is now on a one hundred million dollar contract with FOX.

By now, you should be getting the idea that NOTHING is ever enough for Seth MacFarlane. He always wants MOAR! MOAR shows! MOAR money! MOAR attention! He does not care how much it lacks quality or what it will do to his reputation. As long as there are places where bottom feeders lurk. Seth will be there to take full advantage of it. So it is no surprise when [[Youtube|Jewtube]] rolled about, Seth was one of the first ones there to make an account and hog all the attention from independent video makers for his own network and add funded tripe. Well, you would think,"Hey, At least he is generous enough to put episodes of his shows for people to watch on their own time." Well, guess again. The videos consist of 3 to 12 second Family Guy cutaways that didn't even make it on TV. And that's after you watch the 30-40 second mundane commercial for Priceline or Burger Kind. We're seriously not shitting you here, just watch [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkytUmBOO4o&feature=channel one of them] and tell us that is not just that.

==Trolling==
[[Image:I'm 12.jpg|thumb|left|ED giving your hero (who you thought was indestructible) some well deserved overdue pwnage.]] 
Let's see. We have a talentless hack when it comes to animation, heading an empire of three shows and web shorts with success soulley due to do to pushy gross out potty humor anyone could think of and flamboyant characters who commonly dress in drag. Sound like [[Shane Dawson|anyone familiar?]] On top of this, he is a [[liberal]] political activist, and we're not talking actually studying philosophers and forming ideas of his own that could be considered "liberal", we're talking shouting the typical mainstream Hollywood rhetoric through every Mega Phone he can get his grubby hands on. It gets worse. He seems to have a talent for singing, which you would wonder why he has pursued a career in uncreative mundane cartoons over it, but what ever the reason, he occaisionally makes a public break out singing [[Shit no one cares about|old musicals]]. This has caused a rage of the fugliest 16 year old girls never to even consider getting laid, obsessing over his pretty boy face and then killing themselves when they realize he will never even acknowledge their pathetic existence. So taking all this into consideration, let's go over his fan base. [[13 year old boy|EVERY]] [[16 year old girl|FUCKTARD]] [[leftard|on the]] [[emo|PLANET!]] The reason this is all under "trolling" is because you can not troll Seth MacFarlane, and to this date that theory is yet to be disproven. Why?

Because just like [[Shane Dawson]], his army of fantards is out to find and flame you to cinders the moment you lay a feather of criticism on their god. Write a blog post, Facebook wall post, YouTube comment, Tweet e.t.c. Anything putting Seth in a light other then the crown for king of kings, and they will turn your day, week maybe, upside down. Angry response after angry response, pouring their meaningless days away, trying to fill their void of angst and insecurity with satisfaction from typical tactics and insults, often presenting themselves illiterate. Chants like "[[Your]] [[an|a]] idiot" and "FUK U, Seth is awsome". They are EVERYWHERE,even ED isn't safe from the wrath. I personally, as the first writer to make this an article, guarantee this page will be deleted, redirected back to [[Family Guy]], or go through a retarted [[butthurt]] edit war the moment it is discovered. All on grounds "it is not funny" or "some worthless attack page", all with no explanation on exactly how and no attempts to make it any better or more lulz worthy. He is, one of the top ten leaders, if not number one, when it comes to the world of butthurt fandoms.
