Stealth Cat
'''Stealth Cat''' (aka '''Ninja Cat''', '''Stalking Cat''') is a popular [[cat]] video on [[YouTube]] depicting a sinister looking kitty creeping up on its [[Japanese]] owner.  As with anything on the tubes, there are a few spin offs here and there, usually with some form of shitty [[music]] applied.  Variations so far have included the ''Jaws'' theme, a track from the ''Kill Bill'' movie and, of course, plenty of random, horrible [[techno|IDM]]. The original video has reached [[over 9000|over nine million]] views on the Tube.

Here's the original avec [[moonspeak]] titles... <br />

==Not as funny when there is no cat involved...==
Some people are oblivious to the [[fact]] that the original video's humour and success lies primarily in the super [[awesome]] cat involved. Please note the [[unfunny]] faggots below who love to suck black person dick and thought this shit was funny...
