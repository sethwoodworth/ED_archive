Hypothetical-Kun
Better known as '''H-Kun''', Hypothetical-Kun is a generic [[13 year old boy]] [[camwhore]] who in 2007 provided fap material to a legion of [[pedo]]s [[at least 100 years ago]]. H-Kun carefully worded the introduction to his threads to avoid the [[Permabanned|b&hammer]]. He stated that hypothetically speaking, it was possible for him to be a 13 year old shota and that the following pictures could, hypothetically speaking, be of him. The name "Hypothetical-Kun" was soon given to him.
=== IRC Was Never So Dumb ===
During the time of H-Kun's threads a pedo known as [[fag|Anon1138]] or "James" contacted H-Kun through an AIM screen name that he had posted in his threads so that all of the fapping pedos could give him attention individually. James was the founder of a channel on irc.rizon.net known as #cy/b/er, and it sucked. In order to reconcile his stupid channel, he invited H-Kun to join, who soon became the main attraction for the channel. Somewhere in between then and [[now]] James and H-Kun became involved in an [[internet relationship]]. James handed control of the channel over to some other fag and stopped coming to the channel for reasons he claimed to be that he only came to talk to H-Kun and that that could be done outside of [[IRC]]. James stopped talking to H-Kun for about a month and claimed that it was because he had dropped his laptop 20 feet into a pool of water and had no way to tell him about it. H-Kun [[drama llama|cried]] and they soon broke up (the e-break up is always the worst). It is now assumed that James has since killed himself and that H-Kun is still a dumb ass emo faggot.

noraepplz: ...
noraepplz: you seriously have NO idea how badly you hurt me
Anon: My laptop was destroyed, I just got back yesterday.
Anon: hello?
noraepplz: yeah, I'm here
Anon: Well, my laptop fell from about 20 feet into a concrete gutter with a few inches of water.
Anon: I was going to just buy a new one up there, but I was coming home soon anyway.
noraepplz: why was your laptop in a position to fall 20 feet?
Anon: It doesn't really matter, it was retarded. I'm still fucking pissed at myself for it.
noraepplz: I felt really really used
Anon: :(
Anon: I'm sorry, it wasn't on purpose I just couldn't contact you.
Anon: oh and BTW if I leave suddenly it's just my internet dropping out I should be back after a 
few minutes.
Anon: i mean if I leave like, right now 
Anon: I'm sorry I was away though
noraepplz: I logged on a couple times each day for a month waiting for you to come back
Anon: Sorry, =(
Anon: I'm here now
Anon: How have you been otherwise?
noraepplz: fine
noraepplz: to be honest just yesterday I despised you, it's hard to have such a drastic change 
of emotion
Anon: ;_;
Anon: I didn't do it on purpose
noraepplz: I know
Anon: I guess you need some time then
noraepplz: yes
Anon: ok then, I should be on for my usual hours, you can message me when you feel like it
noraepplz: ok

Several days later:
<pre>
noraepplz: hi
Anon: hello
noraepplz: there's just a couple things I wanted to ask you
Anon: Sure.
noraepplz: why didn't you attempt to tell me what'd happen? I think I remember you telling me that
 your parents had a computer and I can't imagine it's that hard to install aim and tell me
Anon: I tried logging in once but you weren't online at the time. Also, I really didn't want to 
risk using another person's computer, I had no way to tell if it was being logged or something.
noraepplz: couldn't you have gone to a library or something?
noraepplz: you didn't even have to install aim, you could have just used http://wwwl.meebo.com/
Anon: Maybe. I was going to just buy a new laptop.
noraepplz: because it's hard for me to fathom how you could say you cared about me, and make such 
a lousy attempt at telling me why  you wouldn't talk to me for 2 months
Anon: it wasn't 2 months
noraepplz: I may have exaggerated
noraepplz: but the point stands it was a long time to not say anything
Anon: I was going through a lot too with my mom and helping out, I just was busy with so many 
other things
Anon: and trying to keep tabs on things back here, it was very hectic.
Anon: and I am sorry
noraepplz: I can understand that
noraepplz: and I guess it's alright, I can see that you had a lot more important stuff to do
noraepplz: and I'm sorry, but I don't think we could ever get back to what it used to be like
Anon: Well, if that's how you feel, I guess that's just how it is.
noraepplz: do you think we could?
Anon: I don't know. If it was really a problem for you then I guess not then
noraepplz: I'm not opposed to trying
Anon: but if you're going to be angry it's not the same
noraepplz: I don't want to be upset about it
noraepplz: I just can't help it
Anon: If you're going to be angry, it just needs to be done then
noraepplz: alright
noraepplz: good bye then, I guess
Anon: Bye, and good luck. Please try and keep out of trouble.
noraepplz: I canâ€™t make any promises about that now
