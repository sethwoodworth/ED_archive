'''RSS''' stands for Really Simple Syndication. RSS is a way that one can keep up to date on a certain, [[lulz|issue]], [[website]],  or [[journal]]. [[ED]] should have an RSS on new and upcoming [[Lulz]] on the [[Internets]]. [[ALL CAPS|RSS]] is supposed to give you the raw content such as text and pix with no shitty styling, however, they either give you a [[Truth|prewiew or some content with ADS]].

The things you can follow with RSS:
*[[CP]]
*Chans
*Blogs
*Ads
*news
*ads
*<s>humor</s>
*[[ED]]
*ads
*BEST OFFERS FOR BEST PRODUCTS IN LIMITED TIME OFFERS
*permanently subscribing to your girlfriends facebook notifications when you have her password for a limited time.
*more ads
*[[dA]]
*spam
*Stalking [[over 9000]] people in one page.
*bad paragraph alignment
*ads
*giving the item a star.
*ads

<s>[[LiveJournal]] allows users to read RSS feeds through their [[friends page]]. LJ creates temporary pages for each RSS feed entry. Sometimes, drama erupts in said entries. Unfortunately, these entries are only temporary and are automatically deleted by LJ after a short period of time. :'(</s> Shit noone cares about.

Software to use:
*RSSOwl
*Google Reader
