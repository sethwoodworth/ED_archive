'''Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder''' (or "''OCD''") is [[Disorder|a highly infectious cerebral tumor]] which causes the victim to compulsively and [[self-destructive]]ly repeat routine actions like washing, dusting, checking [[Facebook]], touching his or her [[genitals|dirty parts]] several times a <s>day</s> minute or replying to a troll who is baiting the obsessive-compulsives in a discussion group by answering all posts with misspelled [[non sequitur]]s printed in several colors and fonts. 

OCD is also a popular diagnosis when [[e-psychiatry]] is being performed during a [[flame war]], as it implies any opinion expressed by the diagnosed can be dismissed since it stems from his or her uncontrollable need to be a complete [[dick]]. 

OCD is most likely the main force that holds most [[Wiki]]s together (as well as many other parts of the [[internet]]).

== As A Ploy For Attention ==

Much like [[Asperger's Syndrome]], OCD is frequently used in self-diagnoses by [[attention whore]]s. In modern filmography (fucking Monk), certain character quirks are often accounted for by OCD (among other disorders), because the writers are usually too lazy to concoct an actual back story. You do not have OCD.


== Actual Diagnosed Patients ==

[[User:hep|hep]] is an actual diagnosed Obsessive-Compulsive by an [[IRL]] [[psychiatric]] doctor person who likely has OCD him/herself. It mostly manifests in routines and rituals possibly from being raised [[Catholic]]. It runs down directly down the matriarchal line of her family, even her youngest daughter already shows signs of it. In hep's case her OCD actually helps control her OCD but there are still difficulties to work through. Most OCD patients manifest symptoms in different ways depending on severity. Whereas for instance hep is not that badly affected, her mother is insane when not on [[extreme]] [[Drugs|medication]].

== Useful OCD ==

OCD can sometimes be useful for completing tasks that others can't be bothered with doing, such as [[User:Einsidler|Einsidler's]] obsession with fixing [[Special:DoubleRedirects|double redirects]]. '''PROTIP:''' This is currently unnecessary, as the soulless entity known as [[MysteryBot]] now fixes double 
redirects automatically.
