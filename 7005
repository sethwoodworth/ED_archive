'''Rima Fakih''', Miss USA 2010, (born [[terrorist|ريما فقيه‎]] or [[rimjob|Rimaah]] [[whore|Fakmih]] on October 2, 1986) is the last and final prophet of [[Islam]] to succeed [[Black Jesus|Barack Hussein Obama]]. Rima ([[Pedophilia|PBUH]]) was born a [[Muslim]] to parents Abu Bakr and Khadija al Kurba. At age three, her family emigrated to the [[USA]] due to a serious lack of adequate food and clothing in the Islamic state of [[Lebanon]], where she was born (an Arabic country, notable for its production of [[trap]]s; e.g. singer Mika). 

Rima Fakih popularized the final divine version of the Quran (v. 2010), as revealed to her by Angel Gabriel (Jibraeel) in the course of three years. It henceforth allows Muslim women to dance around a chrome pole and display their beauty and grotesque, unwashed body hair publicly, which was previously considered a right only reserved for Muslim men.

As a prophet of Islam, she will be entitled to eleven husbands, some of them being little boys of age nine. Also, after death, the 72 virgins reserved for her will be an equal share of boys and girls according to her sexual orientation, provided she kills at least one Jew in her lifetime. [[Some say|In some circles, it is speculated that]] her prophecy may get revoked if she gets into an affair with a man with Jewish ancestry. 

After [[Black Jesus|Barack Obama]] in 2008, she was crowned Miss USA in 2010, emphasizing on the trend that the [[USA]], like Lebanon, will be transformed to an Islamic state within the next decade. Rima will spend the current year promoting malnutrition and inadequate clothing for the masses in the country. 

=Miss USA Contest=
Like every [[slut|young American girl]], little Rima dreamed that one day she would have her existence validated by [[Donald Trump|creepy old men]]. Unlike other pageant contests, where contestants boast about promoting well-rounded young women, Miss USA prides itself in being just like Trump, by focusing on the [[tits and ass]] of women who's only marketable skill is owning tits and an ass. As well as a talent section, there are also formal and swimwear sections, as well as an interview round that tests contestants for the ability to breath and form semi-well-structured sentences. 

==Formal Wear==
As stated before, Rima loves drugs and pole-dancing. Normally relying on poles to stand up, her walking skills are a little underdeveloped, resulting in a bit of a [http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/video/miss-usa-rima-fakih-tripping-10664406 slip]. 
Should have stayed away from snorting expensive birth control pills before walking!

==Affirmative Action?==
[[File:Mssusa vs missok.jpg|thumb|right|Another white girl oppressed!]]
Some people are wondering if Rima Fakih won the contest fairly, or if it was just another case of Affirmative Action. Given the fact that a white woman has only won Miss America once in the last seventeen years, they may have a point. Race aside, the contest prides itself in being very [[blowjobs|fair]] in judging these young ladies. Or as Donald Trump says, "It's all pink on the inside."

Remember though that in a [[9/11|post-9/11]] and [[Obama|post-racial]] world, we need to highlight the [[Muslim|diversity]] of (non-white) women.  

[[Fox News|Fox News and friends]] could tell [[racism|something was up]] because a blonde white woman did not win. They questioned Miss Oklahoma, who should have won, on if she was set up to lose. Instead of asking her a question about the ability of controlled substances, she was asked a harder (and false question, according to Fox) about the Arizona no-Mexicans law. Obviously, this [[cumdumpster|beautiful young girl]] was set up with a harder question. Continuing the cycle of millions of years of oppression against blondes.

{{quote|No surprise here. Affirmative action was first applied in beauty contests for black women to win in the 1980s, then it was the turn of Latin, brown skinned women, and now it's Muslims.

="Stripper 101" contest=
[[Fox News]] [http://entertainment.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/05/17/miss-usa-rima-fakih-stripping-contest-photos-emerge/ blew their load] when they found out about Rima Fakih's academic career in a Stripper 101 class. Knowing the classy nature of a [[Donald Trump]]-owned beauty contest, many important people are talking questioning Fakih's ability to represent American woman and a role model for younger girls. Since most girls end up being little more than strippers or whores anyway, the answer is clearly "Yes."
