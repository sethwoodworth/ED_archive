'''According to a few million especially delusional [[Christfags]],''' mostly [[Americunts]],  the world is going to end in 2011, starting with the Rapture and Judgment Day on May 21, followed by the actual END OF THE WORLD later in October. This has created an unprecedentedly fine opportunity for [[trolling]]. ON the other hand Christians are being stupid again as they are sending themselves to hell while the atheists can finally live free without Jesus trying to pop-up every three seconds to sell you the bible.

On May 21, at exactly 12 Noon (Israel Daylight Savings Time), The Rapture<sup>TM</sup> will come to pass. At that moment, millions of people (though only the VERY BEST Christians) will [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|suddenly vanish]], all around the globe in one shocking moment. They will actually leave their clothes and shoes etc. right where they had been standing, moments before. Everyone else will be quite puzzled as their friends disappear before their eyes. Cars and airliners will careen out of control as Raptured drivers and pilots suddenly abandon ship. Even the donated organs of these Christians, whether live or dead will be [[Rape|raptured]] right out of the sinner's body. They will all be white too, as you do not hear many Black Churches spewing this crazy.

It will be the [[Catnarok|most awesome thing the world has ever witnessed]].

The billions of [[FCYTravis|innocent babies]], [[IS IT CAN BE HUGS TIEM NOW PLEES?|cute animals]] and other people "left behind" on Earth, all [[Jews|doomed losers]] and not-good-enough Christians,  will then have to face the "Tribulation" of [[H1N1|pestilence]] and other [[tsunami|fucked-up shit]] and the emerging [[Obama|Antichrist]]! and eventually be sent to '''[[LA|Hell]]''' where they will endlessly drown in lakes of fire, with red demons poking pitchforks [[In the ass|in their butts]]. Finally, on October 21, the [[Large Hadron Collider|whole world will fucking END]].

==Is this soem X-tianity?==
According to normal Christians, that is, the ones who follow Jesus in the usual kind of less-disturbing Catholic or Protestant ways, the doctrine of the Rapture "is not and never has been" part of regular Christian belief. It's not in the Bible, or mentioned in the Gospels by Jesus's Disciples. It's not in the Roman Catholic or Greek Orthodox Catechism. Top Christards of the olden days Martin Luther, John Calvin, and John Wesley never heard of it. This Rapture thing is pure [[Mormon|American fantasy]] + [[Scientology|Sci-Fi]].

Around the year 1830 a [[Homeless|wandering street-preacher]] named [[John Mark Karr|John Nelson Darby]] met [[16 year old girl|fifteen year old Margaret MacDonald]] who claimed to have had a [[masturbation|private revelation]] of a [[orgasm|rapture.]] Not all Christians would be rescued, she said, only certain special ones. From this beginning, Darby and his followers started teaching that all true believers will be rescued in a SEKRIT Rapture distinct from the second coming of Christ. Only the extra-good Christians would get to go.  As this was not [[Pedobear| Pastor Darby]]'s first experience of [[Rape| secret rapture]] with a fifteen-year-old girl, this prediction [[this looks shopped|did not look at all shopped]] to him and he spread the word with the aid of a troupe of wandering madmen, the Internets of his day. In the USA the Rapture really took off in the 1860's, as this was a form of Biblical Escapism as the nation had something to really want to escape from. A little event called the Civil War began which made many think that the End Times were really near as the USA began to kick it's own ass for 4 years.  

==Who believes this nonsense?==
This line of thinking somehow caught on and by the mid-20th century it was the mainstream belief for millions of [[John Hagee|Baptist]], [[Jerry Falwell|Pentecostal]] & [[Ted Haggard|Evangelical]] Christians, which are the ones who mostly live in the [[Alabama|US South]]. In fact, they established hundreds of "colleges" for indoctrinating gullible [[White people|young people]] into this belief, holding "Jesus Camps" every summer, and generally making sure that everyone is in full compliance with the doctrine.

Not all [[Rap|Rap]]tards necessarily believe that this will happen on 5-21-2011. Most believe in a pre-Tribulation Rapture (i.e. 5/21), while others believe in a post-Tribulation Rapture. The difference between the Pre-Tribs and the Post-Tribs is just [[tl,dr|shit nobody cares about]] at its finest, so don't [[fapping|waste much energy]] trying to sort it out. Basically, the ones that don't believe in 5/21 think that the Tribulation is already under way, and that the Rapture could happen at any moment -- just not on 5/21.

Nevertheless, Christolaters of every description insist on attempting to nail down a date, despite Jesus himself - whom they are supposed to believe is actually God in person - telling them that they ''will not know'', that the entire ''point'' is that you cannot know when the return of Christ will be, so therefore you should keep your ass permanently clean on the off-chance that today is the day.

[[File:Rapturetiming.jpg|thumb|Rapture timing for your location.]]
The instigator of the 5/21 Raptards is an [[888chan|88]]-year-old [[troll|false prophet and cult leader]] named Harold Camping. This is not the first time he has done the math and set a date for the Last Day. Here's what a non-5/21 Raptard had to say about old Harold:

"HAROLD EGBERT CAMPING, PRESIDENT OF FAMILY RADIO IS UNDER THE DELUSION AND AUTHORITY OF SATAN, AND WILL LEAD YOU DOWN THE PATH OF DESTRUCTION, CONFUSION, AND PAIN. SOMEONE COMMITTED SUICIDE IN 1994, BECAUSE OF HAROLD CAMPING SETTING DATES. This teaching of from Satan. Satan and all unbelievers will be forever punished according to their works in the lake of fire. Harold Camping is a minister of the Devil, and will lead you to the path of destruction if you leave a Bible bases Christian Church, and just sit home by yourself and listen to Family Radio. I say this with [[lolwut|Love and Compassion]] for any listeners of [[christfag|Family]] Radio. You are being deceived by the Devil, if you follow Harold Camping."

===Family Radio===
Harold Camping runs a site called "[http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/graphical_frame.html Family Radio Worldwide.]" This is the international Doomsday headquarters (Or Dday 2: Electric boogaloo, for all you kids out there.)

*[http://www.frtothemedia.com/index.html Family Radio welcomes the media!]

==How to troll them?==
===Simple way:===
{{tinyquote|The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.|Proverbs 10:30 (King James Version)}}
Sometimes, though, the Rapturefags have other quotes up their sleeves which seem to show the opposite. It is vital to have a full array of anti-Rapture Bible quotes at your disposal. Which can lead to a endless bible quote flame war as the Bible is really good at being full of convoluted passages that contradict each other. Or you can just use the classic Ezekiel 23:19-20, which basically said that Egyptian men had Penises the size of Donkeys and Horses, TRUE... look it up.

===More complex and satisfying ways:===
As May 2011 draws ever closer, the Raptards will begin to have terrible crises of faith. Preliminary investigations on their message boards reveal that many of them are quite scared and really wish this wasn't going to happen. Still, they remain certain that it IS going to happen and that there is no way out. If they begin to have doubts, their online preachers put down the hammer and tell these almost-sinners that they are going to be Left Behind!

[[Anon]] will need to put on its many thinking caps to figure out tasty ways to troll these [[retards|knuckleheads]]. Apart from dosing them with chapter and verse of profound anti-Rapture counter-arguments, a few possibilities may include:

*Have them freely sign over to you their beautiful house or car.
*Have them withdraw all their moneys from the banks, and freely give it to you. (Be careful how you do this one -- might look a bit odd to police the day after the Rapture doesn't come.)
*Think of ways to start holy wars, of the Pre-Tribs against the Post-Tribs.
*Join their forums and other groups; pretend at first to be a sincere and committed true-believing Raptard; then do your best to puzzle, confound and dismay them about their Rapture plans, using anti-Rapture facts from the Bible. Bonus points if you can get anyone to renounce Christianity.
*On non-5/21 forums, try to get them to believe in 5/21.
*etc.

===5/22===
May 22 will also be hilarious. When the blessed day of 5/21 has passed, the un-Raptured millions will wake up in terror. Their first thoughts will NOT be that "there was no Rapture"; rather, they will be absolutely certain that they were not good enough for Jesus, and that they have been Left Behind! Now they will have to face the various End Times afflictions, abominations and other assorted bullshit for the next 5 months until 10/21 when [[Yahweh]] pulls the plug.

==O RLY?==
Now I know that a lot of y'all [[Jews|heathens]] disbelieves this [[truth|shizzle]], so [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|let me lay some motherfucking science]] on your ass.

[[File:Raptureproof.jpg|thumb|750px|center|IT ALL MAKES SENSE]]

==Implications for politics==
Because part of the post-Tribulation Rapture story says that the Rapture will come '''after''' the final great battle of Armageddon takes place in [[Iraq|the Middle East]], post-Trib Rapture enthusiasts are constantly pushing for the USA to make wars [[Afghanistan|there]], and to support Israel no matter what. Many think of themselves as "Christian Zionists," or even as a new kind of Jew. And yet according to the Rapture scenario, the Jews themselves will be "left behind," doomed, except those that are [[retard|smart]] enough to convert to Christianity. 

Pre-Trib Raptards going for broke on 5/21 believe all that shit too, except they think they're going to [[Heaven]] before, rather than after the big war.

==How about money?==
[[Image:Gloryaward.gif|thumb|Encyclopedia Dramatica wins again]]
Naturally, the Jews are making money off this delusion. But Rapture X-tians are also raking in the loot. [[Pat Robertson|TV Preachers]] bring in millions of dollars annually by guilt-tripping your obese old grandma into forking over her last $20. 

There is a nice industry, as well, around "End-Times Fiction," the Rapturefag equivalent of sci-fi, which has made a pile of money for various [[masturbation|pulpit-pounders]] over the years. 

==It's a video game, too! Awesome!==
Best of all, there is also a fun collection of video games. For example, in  "Left Behind: Eternal Forces," set in Manhattan, the enemy is the [[United Nations|Global Community]] Peacekeepers led by the Anti-Christ. The good guys are the Tribulation Force, left behind when their fellow Christians are beamed up in the Rapture. To win, the Tribulation side must convert "non-believers," and if that doesn't work, kill them. Their weapons are prayer and assorted armaments including flamethrowers, humvees and tanks. 

*"Yes, there is killing, but it's [[Jihad|faith-based killing]]." -- CEO of ''[http://www.eternalforces.com/ Left Behind: Eternal Forces]'', on being challenged about all the violence in the game.
*Conduct physical & spiritual warfare : using the power of prayer to strengthen your troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world.
*Recover [[creepypasta|ancient scriptures]] and witness spectacular Angelic and [[goth|Demonic]] activity as a direct consequence of your choices.
*Command your forces through intense battles across a breathtaking, authentic depiction of [[New York City]].
*Control more than 30 units types - from Prayer Warrior and Hellraiser to [[The Steganographers|Spies]], Special Forces and [[Battletoads|Battle Tanks]]!
*Control the new [[Real_ID|Infestor]] unit! Hulking parasites that spawn [[STD|Infested]] [[Marines]] to [[rape|swarm]] the enemy!
*Enjoy a robust single player experience across dozens of New York City maps in Story Mode -- fighting in [[Japan|China Town]], SoHo, Uptown and more!
*Spend an [[Internet_money|extra 50 bucks]] on the [[Raptor_Jesus|VelociRapture]] upgrade for twice the [[tubgirl|fun.]]
*Best of all, this is the only RTS game on the market allowing you to play the [[Obama|Antichrist]].
*New [[homeless|Street Preacher]] Expansion Pack allows for in-depth stereotyped graphics.
*This game was created using the same innovative "Test of Faith" game engine of such christian games like War in Heaven and Saints of Virtue. That is the graphics, gameplay and controls are so horrid that only the most devout christfag could even sit through it.

===The Sequels===
Yes, In April 2008 the sequel, Left Behind II: Tribulation Forces was released as there are enough christfags to buy the first one and sit through the bad graphics and shitty game-play as they are used to suffering for their faith. Despite using the Rise of Nations engine this game is just as much FAIL as the first. While jesustards give this 5 stars on Amazon, anyone with a function brain will tell you this game sucks. That was followed up with Left Behind: Rise of the Anti-Christ, which is more of the same shit sandwich.

==Anti-Christ==
Since the rapturefags all think the end is near, it means that the Anti-Christ must be alive on earth. There are speculations, usually with some extremely convincing, complicated to explain "PROOF," about who the Anti-Christ is.

Possible Candidates:

*[[Saddam Hussein]]
*[[Iran|Ayatollah Khomeini]]
*[[Charles Darwin]]
*[[Ronald Reagan]]
*[[Bill Clinton]]
*[[Barack Obama]]
*[[Palestine|Yasser Arafat]]
*Every Secretary General of the [[UN]] EVAR!!!
*[[Your Mom]]

==TIMING OF IMPORTANT EVENTS IN HISTORY (according to Raptards)==
Rapture fetishists have amazingly detailed and nonsensical "timelines" of how the shit's gonna go down (see examples in the gallery below)

*11,013 BC—Creation.  God created the world and man (Adam and Eve).
*4990 BC—The flood of Noah’s day.  All perished in a worldwide flood.  Only Noah, his wife, and his 3 sons and their wives survived in the ark (6023 years from creation).
*7 BC—The year Jesus Christ was born (11,006 years from creation). 
*33 AD—The year Jesus Christ was crucified and the church age began (11,045 years from creation; 5023 calendar years from the flood).
*1988 AD—This year ended the church age and began the great tribulation period of 23 years (13,000 years from creation).
*1994 AD—On September 7th, the first 2300-day period of the great tribulation came to an end and the latter rain began, commencing God’s plan to save a great multitude of people outside of the churches (13,006 years from creation).
*'''2011 AD: On May 21st, Judgment Day will begin and the Rapture (the taking up into Heaven of God’s special-est people) will occur at the end of the 23-year great tribulation.'''  
*'''On October 21st, the world will be destroyed by fire (exactly 7000 years from the flood; exactly 13,023 years from creation).'''

==Other days the Rapture has happened on==
===More generally, "End of the World."===
*'''200 AD'''
*'''1000 AD'''
* '''1792'''
* '''2060''' - Sir Isaac Newton proposed, based upon his calculations using figures from the book of Daniel, that the Apocalypse could happen no earlier than 2060. Okay...this is from the guy who discovered GRAVITY. It is like Dr Stephen Hawking calculating when the Lord Xenu will invade earth based on repeated viewings of Battlefield Earth. 
* '''2121''' - The True Date Jesus will come...in your mouth.
* '''2677''' - The date Lord Xenu will return to Earth proposed by Dr. Stephen Hawking, after repeated viewings of Battlefield Earth all because someone left the DVR on in his room, and he cannot move to turn it off.

===Specifically as "the Rapture"===
* '''1844 (twice)'''
* '''1977'''
* '''1981''' 
* '''1988''' 
* '''1989'''
* '''1992'''
* '''1993'''
* '''1994'''
* '''July 5th 1998''' - X-Day when the Xists led by J.R. "Bob" Dobbs will lay waste to Earth and destroy all normals and usher in total slack for all those who sent him $30.
* '''2000'''
* '''2001'''
* '''2007'''
* '''2011'''
* '''2012''' - Other Christfags decided to merge their bullshit with the Mayan bullshit. even though it is false pagan teachings.
* '''2150''' - This is the start of the Age of Aquarius, Jesus was born on 1AD at the Start of the Age of Pisces, his AGE will end on 2150 with the new age. So in any major spiritual event or second coming will happen it will happen on this year.

==Final Word==

This rapture mess is the result of the bad translation of the King James Bible, which all fundamentalists swear is the one true version of the bible, even-though Moses, Jesus and everyone in the bible did not speak Elizabethan English. As a result it is also the worst translated as it was not translated from the original Hebrew and Greek texts but rather Dutch and German. Jesus's birth happened in 1AD the start of the Astrological age of Pisces, this is why FISH symbols appear in the New Testament. Jesus was never talking about the end of the world but the end of the AEON, which translated to AGE. Jesus was talking about the coming age of Aquarius, so 2150 will be a year that something could happen as the bible has major prophets appear to usher in each new age.
