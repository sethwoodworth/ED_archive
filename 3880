{{tinyquote|'''It's how hackers talk when they don't want to be overheard.'''|A shitty CBS show chocked full of dumb jews who should stick to [[truth|controlling the media]] and [[jews did wtc|doing the WTC]] and not talk about computers in front of a camera}}

'''I'''nternet '''R'''elay '''C'''hat ('''IRC''') (AKA Multiplayer Notepad) has been around for [[Over_9000|65 billion years]]. It's the bastard offspring of [[UNIX]] talk and ntalk protocols.

To put it simply, IRC is like a normal chat system, except instead of chat (which doesn't happen as everyone is either idle or a bot) as the main activity, the main activity of IRC is op-wars and [[Denial of Service|denial of service]] attacks.  Ops are people who kick and ban those from a room who suck up the least (the non-ops don't have that so they denial of service attack them instead), which causes the banned users to retaliate by DDoSing the ops and the IRC network and ChanServ, then gaining ops on a split.

Unsurprisingly, the [[existence]] of channels (to make communication a bit easier) created potential for vast amounts of [[drama]], which quickly transformed from being potential to actual drama, human beings being what they are. Channel and network drama happens at an exponential rate of growth, but since anything rarely goes past words in the IRC protocol, it's entirely harmless and pointless. Stupid drama. IRC also is used to transfer two very types of [[trolling|important]] [[cybersex|communication]].

IRC users are on a continuous quest to gain more status. There are always more channels and more servers on which to gain [[ops]]. IRC is also a center for [[warez]].  Once you've got lots of ops, IRC users can try and climb the "LeetLadder". You've never seen anything so useless as someone with lots of IRCops who tries to use that status [[IRL]].

Most people use [[smiley]]s to express their feelings on IRC. Meanings of smileys differ from channel to channel. For example, people on one channel might say "::D" when they see something funny, but on another they might say "=DDDd" to express the same feeling. Acronyms like [[LOL]], [[ROFL]] or [[LMAO]] are also used to express feelings but, as with smileys, their emotional content differ greatly from channel to channel.

Much [[lulz]] on IRC can be had at the expense of [[newbie|nubs]], who are often told to [[scroll up]] after pasting old [[meme]]s.

==Networks==
Today there are several thousand running IRC networks in the world. They run various implementations of IRC [[server]]s, and are administered by various groups of [[Op]]s (who are identified by the "@" before their screen name and the [[Satan]] palpably leaking from their black, black hearts), but the protocol exposed to IRC users is very similar, and all IRC networks can be accessed by the same client software.

===Anonymuncule===
Home of the recently resurrected ED IRC. *[irc://irc.anonymuncule.com irc.anonymuncule.com]

===AnonNet===
[[AnonNet|AnonNet]] is basically a gay cybersex mmorpg, so naturally anonymous soon felt right at home there - causing all the other irc networks to become jelous and ddos the living fuck out of their servers. Following the partyvan imposion AnonNET joined with SP IRC and rehomed the remaining Chanology channels, including #london #manchester #nyc [[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY|#wwp]] and a load of others.. Later it went on to feature more useless shit like #timevote #bestactever [[iran|#iran]] #marblecake [[Titstorm|#titstorm]] [[Freeweb|#Projectfreeweb]] and various internet radio stations including #flux and #nethalt.

===Chatnets===
Has 5 servers. New home of [[aids|#711chan, #pn, and the revived (and hopefully soon dead) PartyVan.fm]]: [irc://irc.chatnets.net]

===euIRC===
[[European]] IRC Network, where all the Eurofags hang out since the Servers with [[US]]-people are "too stupid" for them.
Nobody outside of Europe knows about euIRC though, making it tantamount to a [[concentration camp]].

===EFnet===
[[Image:Efnet.jpeg|thumb|EFnet]]

Eris Free Net, the original [[IRC]] server network. By far the largest, most influential, and most culturally prolific IRC network. Occasionally those unfamiliar with IRC ask "What does EFnet got that [[Freenode|_Insert random retarded small network here_]] hasn't?"

The only proper answer to this is "everything". Except nickname services. It has great channel services that registers your channel as you idle as an operator! You don't have to mess with registrations, passwords, email validation... 'cause it's [[leet]] like that.

The pastime of EFnet is OP wars: fighting over who is channel operator.  These are won by whoever can perform denial of service attacks the best.  They are started by: (1) boredom of visitor, (2) OPs who ban people from boredom.

The [[Penis Pump]] [[troll]]s often times keep the EFnet opers busy, because opers are summoned to their channel [[at least 100]] times a day. This has died down as of late, but going into #efnet and calling the ops fags is still fun. Other channels of note include #computers (sup port forwarding), #anxiety, #depression, #space_ghetto, and #sex, none of them really need any explanation as you will find the lulz within the first few minutes of connecting.

EFnet's channel <nowiki>#israel</nowiki> is a major source of [[lulz]] as it is filled with [[Zionists]]. For example, stealing some [[Jewgold|Jewlulz]] with [[User:Creativity|Creativity]]:
 <Cr34tiv3> Why don't jews just be friends with Palestinians?
 <FloydTB> shut up
 <FloydTB> he is just boring
 <FloydTB> shaye, whats your job now?
 <FloydTB> how much money are you making?
 <Cr34tiv3> I have neighbors who are Palestinian too, and they don't bother me
 <shaye> ye bezeq
 <dov> what kind of attitude is that, Cr34tiv3 ?
 <shaye> dov ban him :)
 <Cr34tiv3> How do you scare a Jew?
 <Cr34tiv3> Put him in the oven.
 <Cr34tiv3> OH WAIT NO I MESSED UP! 
 <Cr34tiv3> I meant to say "Turn the oven on!"
 <Cr34tiv3>I always mess that one up at our Hitler Youth meetings.
 <shaye> dov ban him :)
 <Cr34tiv3> DOV MEANS BEAR
 <Cr34tiv3> OMG I KNOW THAT
 <dov> hump Cr34tiv3 like this
 <Cr34tiv3> I read that in The Chosen
 <Cr34tiv3> by chaim potok
 <FloydTB> can you ban this guy?
 <Cr34tiv3> Are Jews still mad at Russians? BEcause Dov is Bear in Russian.
 <FloydTB> Hey stop man.
 <Cr34tiv3> Your IRC channel is secretly run by Russian neo-nazis!
 <Cr34tiv3> If they request you take a journey by train, don't!
 <FloydTB> Look, you're pissing us off.
 <Cr34tiv3> That means they are taking you to Auschwitz1
 <Cr34tiv3> Why aren't there any Jewish mothers on parole boards?
 <Jerusalem> Do you think you are funny?
 <Cr34tiv3> They'd never let anyone finish a sentence!
 <shaye> oh my god ban him!
 <Cr34tiv3> You mean Yaweh?
 <shaye> dov ban him
 <Cr34tiv3> What does Hezbollah missle feel like?
 <shaye> SHUT THE FUCK UP!
 <Cr34tiv3> Why is money green?
 <shaye> GET TEH FUCK OUT!
 <Cr34tiv3> Jews pick it before its ripe
 >>> User shaye has been kicked off #israel by dov (Banned: No cursing.)
 <Cr34tiv3> So anyway, why do you Jews smell so bad?
 <Cr34tiv3> Like you know, its a mix of dirty dollar bills and latkes?
 <dov> hump Cr34tiv3 like this
  mode/#israel [+b *!*@adsl-75-6-149-4.dsl.skt2ca.sbcglobal.net] by
           Jerusalem
 >>> You have been kicked off #israel by Jerusalem (Banned: like this)
  [#israel] Banned from channel

===IRCnet===
IRCnet is also the original IRC network (depending on whom you ask). Actually, the original network does not exist anymore, because it was split into EFnet and IRCnet somewhere in the mid-1990s after some deep disagreement and a lot of drama between European and American IRC operators. This event is called The Great Split by [[loser|IRC historologists]]. In practice, most of the European, Australian and Japanese servers (as well as an American server named Eris) went to the IRCnet side and the rest of the world to the EFnet side.

IRCnet is now mostly populated by European nerds and old farts who have been using  the network for the last 15 to 40 years and are definitely not going to switch away. There are also many [[Polish]] and [[Italian]] trolls and that's why Poland and Italy have been permanently [[banned]] from most of the IRCnet channels. And yes, since the IRCnet operators are bored purists who don't want to change anything, IRCnet has even less services-like functionality than EFnet.

===TheFailshipIRC===
The worthless offspring of a falling out between faggots who used AnonNet. TheFailshipIRC is now a well known source of lulz. A network consisting of losers attempting to run an IRC network using 8088 machines and dial-up connections, it is the proverbial paper target for every botnet, TCP flood shell, and skiddy with a floodbot script on the internets. Some would argue TheFailship's best (and only) offering is their streaming site where they loop the same 3 mid-90's cult classics over and over and offer chats about the movie being streamed. You can usually find all of the IRCops in the chat, since they are they only ones watching the movie in the first place. TheFailship also offers a public mumble server, where frequent prank phone calls are made at night time that are a great source of lulz. TheFailship is most recently noted as being the host of Project Payback for nearly a week, and the now well known ACS E-Mail leaks. irc.thefailship.net

===Undernet===
[[Image:Banbot.png|thumb|What IRC looks like if you are on [[Bantown]].]]

An [[IRC]] network with only channel services and lots of people who [[idle]] and trade [[child porn]]. It only has around five servers these days, you'd think they could keep them from splitting. Capcom thought they would be clever and in Shameless Mega Man Spinoff #237, used the name for the computer network equivalent of Compton.

===Helldive Network===
Formerly formerly [[lulznet]], and formerly Partyvan, the network consisted of roughly 12 servers, including 711chan's former IRC server [[Patriotic Nigras|PN]]. The network was home to #insurgency (formerly on EFnet), #[[tomgreen]] (formerly on Rizon until [[Axila]] took over), and various [[anon]]-oriented channels.

Partyvan has died. Januszeal <strike>told everybody to pack their shit and go home, so they did as he pulled the plug on services and Partyvan softly faded away.</strike> slowly pissed off everyone on the server by being a general fuckup and not knowing how to run an irc server.  The ones who knew what they were doing left to form over 9000 other networks, and Januszeal sat alone in his room and cried.    It has many leaves, but almost all of them are hosted on 10 year old computers in Januszeal's [[basement-dweller|bedroom]].  He is desperately trying to revive partyvan, and is doing an [[fail|excellent job]], once again [[sarcasm|proving his skills and intelligence]] by linking with IRC servers run on windows ME desktop computers by 19 year old aspies who live in their parents' basement in bumfuck Louisiana.

Helldive is currently dead after a massive [[jizz]] war and januszeal ragequitting.  The servers have since split up into multiple networks, including TsukiIRC, wtfux,and  xax.li.  NekoArc and most of the other opers have moved their shit to [irc://irc.tsukihi.me/ TsukiIRC].

===Rizon===
[[Image:Rizon-lol.jpg|thumb|Rizon servers]]

Home to #[[4chan]] and #1.0, faggots like ''ALTERNATIVE'' and ''awyeah'', and many [[fan]]subbing [[animé]] [[faggot]] groups. The most frequent line articulated across Rizon is "[[^_^]]". In 2007, operator Jason Michael Downey received an [[IRL ban]]hammer from the [[FBI]] and is currently working his way through a one year sentence for using a [[botnet]] to [[DOS]] other networks and their operators. One was unlucky enough to [http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/11/29/fbi.botnets/index.html lose $19,500 because of the attacks], the biggest loss to the IRC world since [[Rob Levin]] met the front end of a [[Car|Ford Taurus]].

===Other Notable Networks===
[[Image:Reps.png|thumb|People sophisticatedly expressing their joy on IRC.]]
[[Image:Gnaa-wikipedia-assault.jpg|thumb|What IRC looks like if you are on [[Freenode]].]]
*[http://www.gorf.us/ gorfnets] is family friendly chats w/ [[Giraffe|gorfs]], no flood limits, tweets :D, #chats @ [irc://irc.gorf.us irc.gorf.us]
*[irc://irc.tsukihi.me TsukiIRC]: Most of helldive's servers moved here after it's death.  Originally run by NekoArc and derpcat
*DalNet, where everyone was before they made it to UnderNet, former object of hatred for EFNet users. Now an internet ghost town.
*The private network [[idlenet]], governed by the evil [[cj]] contains the popular and [[drama]]tic channel [[insub]].  Don't go there, you won't like it.
*Nightstar is where #[[wiigii]]! lives. You probably shouldn't go there either, as the stench of unwashed fanboy is strong.
*EmpireIRC is probably the only place on the interwebz where there is around 5 servers to cater to 10 poke-nerds. It is a waste of time to even go there due to a weird cult following of a senior member by the nickname of Rex. His [[unfunny|obsession with cows]] will break down even the toughest of minds and if that doesn't kill you listening to his mindless minions talk about him when he is not there will.
*LinkNet is the home of most of the warez movement, but that will not be apparent upon entering it. Everyone moved there after they realized EFNet was just making them accessible to [[13-year-old boys]]
*zirc is the network of choice for users of the [[Something Awful]] forums. It is rumored that the [[SALJ]]ers are there too but [[noone]] is sure where now that #salj is defunct. Recent [[drama]] has led most servers and users to [[switch]] to the new network SynIRC.
*Slashnet was created by Slashdot, and has attendant amounts of suck. Dupe channels are frequent and many channels are just thinly disguised trolls.
*ICQNet is the official IRC network for popular chat protocol [[ICQ]], so you just know it's going be AOLicious. ICQAOLNet funnels [[13 year old boys]], [[16 year old girls]] and 45 year-old pedophiles in from their webpage, with promises of [[Cybersex|hot cyber]]. At first glance this may appear to be a joke, but amongst the top channels is #teens, # z40_Something and #Looking_For_Love.
*[[Freenode]] is the crap network run by <s>[[Rob Levin]]</s> and is the IRC locale of choice for [[open source]], [[Wikipedia]], and [[Lunix]] [[fanboys]]; consequently, the opportunities for drama are considerable.
*'''GameSurge''', is a North American IRC network focused on video games.  It is here you will gain access to a plethora of channels dedicated to gaming.  Whether you're looking for a team to join or to start, or simply to build upon, the network is home to all competitive NA teams and features channels that allow you to find scrims, ringers and teams.  Counter-Strike: Source (CSS) and Counter-Strike 1.6 provide the network with the most activity, but it is also hosts official channels for other games such as TF2, L4D, CoD4, etc.  Unfortunately, GameSurge also is home to the SourceNetwork, which owns and operates all the essential channels pertaining to CSS.  The SourceNetwork's head hauncho, Tony, has his ass full of his face.  His SourceNetwork, and ventrilo provider MaxFrag (which he ceaselessly advertises in his channels), are the only venues Tony has in life where he can stretch his [[e-peen]].  He is the physical inversion of King Midas in that everything he touches turns to shit.  His gaming league Built On Energy (BOE) collapsed, his CSS team "mob" was a failure, and his forums receive more posts from spam bots than human beings.  He is an icon of disrepute in the CSS scene.  He is a shit stain on white linen cloth, a cockroach in a fine Italian wine sauce, and a super-imposed cock on a nude photo of Meagan Fox.  See also, [[fagget]].
*[[Abducted IRC]], a network for evil foreigners.
*Underworldweb, a network for elitist loser drug tards.
*DeltaAnime, usually for online games like ''Ragnarok'', ''L2 Online'', etc. -- Make sure to annoy the ops as much as you can here. They're all really blatant aspies. Paul, A co-owner, and Francisco(Delta) the owner, who both contain untold amounts of butthurt (Also Paul got v& once.)
*IRCHighway, for teenage weeaboos and [[Desuchan]]. Also home to [[Katawa Shoujo|#katawa-shoujo]].
*Aniverse was the former server for [[animu]] and fansubbing groups before [[lulz|DDoS]] attacks and allegations of its owner, Ukyo who is 
*[[Austnet]], simply the best IRC network to troll. If you get glined, leave it to attempt to reconnect...it'll work after a few tries. Everyone here is seemingly stupid. 
*Megatokyo, taking donation money to fly to Japan. Almost everyone that wasn't a [[faggot]] of #megatokyo jumped to Rizon making it the new home of absolute [[shit]]. Nothing of value was lost.
*ARG-IRC, full of idiots, ex-channers, fun to troll, owner, [[faggot|Magick]] is sum [[Computer Science III|elite haxxor]] home of the [[Littlekuriboh|''Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series'' IRC chat]]
*[[Anthrochat]] Furry irc, easy to troll, fun to get them pissed. 
*Bitcast is pretty much an empty network that runs on iintens' servers. The only thing it is good for is for hackers to run their secret botnets - sometimes a few people drop by and dramachat - irc.bitcast.ws
*IRCStorm.net is a fairly well populated server with a userbase composed mostly of people living in the southern US, or people from the southern US living elsewhere. Was created by a couple of ancient, inbred hicks who have disappeared after they got divorced and one of them died. The users/staff typically make George W. Bush look like Richard Dawkins, and as such are fun to troll. Channels of note are #lobby, #teen-chat, #christians, #schizophrenia and #narecoverychat (a 12-step chatroom).

There are quite a few options to consider when choosing an IRC client.  Here are a few.

===[[mIRC]] (Windows)===
[[mIRC]] is one of the most popular IRC clients out there.

:Pros
*Very widely used.
*Sets the standard for IRC clients: logging, scripting, etc.
*Window arrangement. (able to see multiple channels windows at a time)
Cons
*Jeware.
*Written by some Arab.
*Biggest target for [[0-day]].
*Scripting language is unusable in other clients, meaning that scripts are not portable without re-writing it in a different language.
:'''[http://anonym.to/?http://www.mirc.com/ http://www.mirc.com/]'''
:'''[http://anonym.to/?http://distro.ws/index.php?dir=&search=mIRC.v6.35&search_mode=f http://distro.ws/index.php?dir=&search=mIRC.v6.35&search_mode=f]

===ChatZilla (Cross-platform, firefox extension)===
An OK client in the form of a Firefox extension. It's got the basic stuff an IRC client should have, like logging.

Pros
*Easy to use.
*Can be run in its own Firefox tab; just type "chrome://chatzilla/content/chatzilla.xul" in the address bar.
Cons
*Easily acquirable, even by newfags. Because of that, anyone who doesn't bother to configure their settings is <s>autokicked from #insurgency</s> suffers no consequences of note.
*When logging, it creates a new file for every day. Not good if you're a nostalgiafag who likes to go back to look at old times.
*Using '''ChatZilla''' instantly turns you from super 1337 to a total n00b with a single click. Expect to be ridiculed if you are connecting to any servers where [[Internet Tough Guy|hard chatting]] is serious business.



'''*zaiger sets mode: +b *!chatzilla@*'''

===HydraIRC (Windows)===
Another okay client for Windows.

Pros:
*Channel Monitor window allows you to view messages from all channels.
Cons:
*Still in beta, and hasn't been worked on in ages.
*Advertises itself in /quit messages.
:'''[http://anonym.to/?http://www.hydrairc.com/ http://www.hydrairc.com/]

===KVIrc (Windows & Linux)===
This client is best known for its customizability; nearly every aspect of its theme can be changed.

Pros:
*Themes can be customized and changed if you're into that sort of thing.
*Activity Monitor option displays a neat little colored icon besides each nickname, showing how active they are. Helpful if you're an op and want to clean out spais/lurkers.
*Scriptable.
Cons:
*As with mIRC, scripts made for KVIrc can't be used in other clients. Not like there are many scripts out there for it anyhow.
*Tends to get rather slow on older computers.
*Like ChatZilla, logs are split into days, making them harder to search through.
:'''[http://anonym.to/?http://www.kvirc.net/ http://www.kvirc.net/]'''

===irssi (Cross platform)===
Console-based IRC client. Despite that, it's one of the <s>best</s> worst clients out there, if you <s>know what you're doing</s> like to fuck with commands all day long and edit config files.

Pros:
*Uses Perl as its scripting language. No need to learn a language you're only going to use for one purpose!
*Because it's console-based, you can put irssi on a shell and run it from any computer with an SSH client.
*Very fast, so it's great for old computers.
Cons:
*May be hard to use if you're used to [[GUI]]-based clients. Using a program in Cygwin called "screen" helps.
*Can't do much without scripts.
*<s>May lead to [[suicide]] when setting up.</s> Run it in Cygwin. Running it in [[DOS]] would be stupid.
:'''[http://anonym.to/?http://irssi.org/ http://irssi.org/]

=== Reduce your risk of being dox'd ===
If you are using IRSSI, you can reduce the risk of being doxed by changing your <tt>real_name</tt> and <tt>user_name</tt>, near the end of <tt>~/.irssi/config</tt>

 settings = {
   core = {
     # setting = "new_value"; # "old_value";
     real_name = "nobody"; # "John Smith";
     user_name = "nobody"; # "jsmith";
     nick = "Sexyman6969";
   };
   "fe-text" = { actlist_sort = "refnum"; };
 };

Running Cygwin on a remote server also helps, especially if you want to use IRC on a mobile phone where the phone provider does not allow IRC to be used over their network.  On a mobile phone, you can use ConnectBot for [[Android]].

===XChat (Windows, Linux, OS X [as XChat Aqua])===
Nice, clean client with a good amount of features. 

Pros:
*Able to use Perl, and a few other languages.
*Some popup menus are customizable, as are a group of buttons under the userlist.
*No longer outputs all IRCop blabber to your active window. It puts it all nicely in the 'status' window of the server you are connected to.
*Easy to spoof CTCP replies with to be a leet [[hacker]]
*[[User:Derpcat|Some faggot]] ported [http://www.hurrchan.net/wiki/Fuckyou.pl fuckyou.pl] and a [http://www.hurrchan.net/wiki/Derp.pl flooding script] to Xchat to make oper abuse easier.

Windows version:
<strike>:'''[http://anonym.to/?http://www.mediafire.com/?j4d8o2ttv5y7368]''' use '''Launcher.bat''' to open it. This is much better then some script kiddie using a bytejump in disasm and fucking up memory plus this requires no updates on new versions. (This jewware is sold under violation of the license xchat is developed under, so fuck the jew that sells it.)</strike>
:[http://code.google.com/p/xchat-wdk/] A better and free open source version.
Should be in your [[linux]] repos too.

===Colloquy (OS X)===
Decent client, more than enough for most irc use. However, it locks up hard when any open channel or query gets flooded.
:'''[http://anonym.to/?http://colloquy.info/ http://colloquy.info/]'''

===Linkinus (OS X)===
A pretty good client. Doesn't lock up like Colloquy, but has it's downfalls. It is a new application, so it is not as advanced as the others. But very stable.
:'''[http://anonym.to/?http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus] NOT CRACKED'''

===Snak (OS X)===
Probably the best [[GUI]] client for OS X. But it's fucking jewware.
:'''[http://anonym.to/?http://www.snak.com/ http://www.snak.com/] NOT CRACKED'''

===jmIrc (J2ME-enabled devices, such most cell phones)===
An IRC client for...your cell phone? Yeah, a lot of apps like this one exist, but this seems like the best free one out there.

Pros:
*Well, with this, you can IRC IRL.
*A "Favorites" list allows you to keep a list of frequently-used commands.
Cons:
*It's made for a cell phone, so you're not gonna see a lot of features.
*On some phones, it may freeze up when trying to send a message.
:'''[http://anonym.to/?http://jmirc.sourceforge.net/ http://jmirc.sourceforge.net/]'''

==If you couldn't be bothered to read the above and couldn't give a flying fuck about which is better ...==

... try [http://www.mibbit.com/chat Mibbit]. It requires no knowledge, thought or effort to use.  However, [[neckbeard|experienced IRC users]] will point and laugh at you.

==Bots==
Because IRC is a tedious bore, where the few and far between [[lulz]] drown in a sea of [[drama]], people often [[quitting IRC forever|leave]]. The jewel encrusted founders, who believe that user counts contribute to their [[e-penis]], pad out the channel with unintuitive automated clients called [[bot]]s. A bot’s job is to ensure you have no lulz at all by wearing the remaining human user-base down with constant abuse. Bots employ the following tactics:
*[[spamming]] the [[Urban Dictionary]] definition of [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=queef&f=1 queef] every quarter-second
*repeating the same damn 6 quiz questions in sequence for 6 hours straight (which the [[13 year old boys|players]] still fail to answer correctly)
*kicking anyone who types more than 2 lines in 10 seconds
*getting into kick-loops with each other
*foiling your mass-kick antics

There are many different types of bots, but they’re all owned and configured by [[retards]], so whatever positive features they have will be disabled, or twisted into various extremes of stupid.

See: [[madcow]]

==Guide for new users==
* Type '/server (server)' or use the connect to connect to a new IRC server (use '/server -m (server)' to connect in a new IRC window without disconnecting from the current server. There are several large networks like EFnet (irc.efnet.net) and Rizon(irc.rizon.net, aka animu central). Of other note are private servers irc.pirated.ws, irc.7chan.org, and irc.chatnets.net. Some places, like Rizon or Chatnets, or really any place except stone-age EFnet, has a NickServ. Register with NickServ (type '/msg nickserv register passwordhere realemailhere') and then '/msg nickserv identify password' to be identified. Some places, like #4chan on Rizon, require you to be registered with NickServ to join.
* Type '/j #channel' or '/join #channel' (it's the same) to join a channel. To part, just close it with the red X, or type /part #channel somemessage if you want to be fancy.
* To change nick, type '/nick newnickhere'. There is a limit on how long the nick can be; some networks only allow a maximum of 9 characters, while others let you go up to 18.
* To send a private message, use '/msg nick message here blah blah dongs'. In most clients, private messages appear in a little new window. 

===People on IRC===
* Channel founders, +q, have a "~" by their name, and are the creators of the IRC channel. They can change all channel settings and modes. 
* Super-ops, aka +a or admins, have a "&" by their name, have the same powers as ops, can access some ChanServ commands, and cannot be kicked by normal ops. 
* Ops, aka +o, have an "@" by their name. They can ban, kick, add and remove ops, change the topic, and make your life hell.
* Half ops, aka hops or +h, they have a "%" by their name. They can ban and kick, add and remove voice, change the topic and set a few modes. 
* Voiced, or +v, have a "+". They are just regular users who we trust for the most part and have been there a while. Also, if the channel is set +m (moderated, basically mute) they and the +q, +a, +o and +h people can talk, while regular users can't. 
** A few channels set +v on join, usually if it's +m so that ops can remove voice from people who spam or whatever.

A user without a "~", "&", "@", "%", or "+" is just a regular person. They may feel as clueless as you. Just use IRC, and you will learn. Weeaboos, check out irc.rizon.net, gamers, irc.gamesurge.net, and really just join random channels to see what's going on. On efnet, basically any word has a channel for it, so explore and lurk.

Note about Lurking: '''SAY SOMETHING EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE'''. Many channels get sick of people just joining and watching, at least let them know who you are so someone doesn't kick you or something. So, you can lurk, but be sure to talk occasionally. The IRC world is extremely intolerant of newfags.

A side note, another breed of IRC dweller not previously mentioned is the IRC Operator (IRCop).  Worse than a channel operator, these bastards will [[Death|kill]] or [[G-Line|Z-Line]] you for merely existing.  Identified by a different nick color (for mIRC lusers), or by the presence of the following in a /whois, avoid these beings at all costs, as most of them have little, or no sense of humor.

How to identify an IRC Operator (from mIRC):
<pre>
[04:13] * ThisGuy is myname@isp-127.0.0.1.myisp.net
[04:13] * ThisGuy is <<deathbringer>>
[04:13] * ThisGuy is an IRC Operator/Server Administrator/Server Co-Administrator/Services Administrator/Network Administrator (only one of these)
[04:13] * ThisGuy is on ?#staff, ~lobby, &staffjerks
</pre>

'''YOU WERE WARNED'''

===Channel Operator (@)===
Operators are the [[sysops]] of the IRC realm. They only exist to [[rape|kick]] you repeatedly and [[ban]] you when you make a [[fag]]gy comment.  They are power-hungry bastards with no sense of compassion. Aside from idling, most time spent on IRC is from op wars--this is fighting over the power to be an op. OPs often grow bored on IRC and entertain themselves by kicking and banning people.<br/>Channel Operators also make up the most important line of defense in flood attacks, if your channel gets flooded, the best way to handle it is like this:

<pre>
/mode #channel +o pynchon
</pre>

===How To Get Ops===
 <superfreek> give me ops
 <@retardop> ok
 ** channel set +o superfreek
 <@superfreek> lol
 ** channel set +b retardop
 ** retardop has been kicked by superfreek (lol)
 -retardop- omg [[bash.org]]

==Tips for more experienced users==

===Secure noticing===
To send a message to everyone on a channel with a certain level or higher, type this:

::/notice (~|&|@|%|+)#channel message 

where the symbol represents the minimum level to send the message to (see "People on IRC").

Use this to share sensitive information without spais finding out.

===Services===
There are IRC services on most servers (this is mainly Anope services, others exist.  what works for one doesn't work for all, don't get butthurt when banned for wrong commands), save for stone-age EFnet. Read: 

====NickServ====
Use NickServ to keep others from using your nick and to keep ops/voice/etc. on channels.

* <code>/msg nickserv register password email</code> - Register your nickname.
* <code>/msg nickserv identify password</code> - Identify yourself.
* <code>/msg nickserv ghost nick password</code> - Get someone who's using your nick to quit. It can also be used in case you disconnect, but your old nick hasn't pinged out yet.
* <code>/msg nickserv help</code> - List all commands. 

====ChanServ====
With a registered and identified nick in an unregistered channel where you are an op:

:/msg ChanServ register #channelname password brief description. 

=====Managing channel access=====
You can have services automatically op/voice/etc. people, depending on which system you use. Note that when giving a user access, that user must be registered with NickServ.

======XOP system======

:/msg ChanServ xop #channelname add nick 

Where "xop" is either:

* "vop" for auto-voice
* "hop" for auto-halfops
* "aop" for auto-ops
* "sop" for auto-superops 

You can also change "add" to "del" to delete someone from your list.

======Access level system======

:/msg ChanServ access #channelname add nick level
*Adds a user to the access list with that level. If a user is already on the list, their level will simply be changed to the specified level.

:/msg ChanServ access #channelname del nick
*Deletes a user from the access list.

By default, the following access levels are defined:

*Founder - Gives +qo upon entering, allows full access to ChanServ commands.  Only one user may have this status.
*10 - Gives +ao upon entering, allows access to akick.
*5 - Gives +o upon entering.
*3 - Gives +v upon entering.
*0 - Nothing.
*&lt;0 - User cannot be opped.

=====ChanServ kick=====
Too much of a pussy to kick/ban someone yourself? ChanServ can do it for you!

:/msg ChanServ (kick|ban) #channelname nick reason 

Note that if the channel has signkick enabled (default), your nick will be displayed in the kick message. 

====HostServ====
With a registered nick, you can replace your plain old hostname with a vHost, which is basically just a fake hostname.

To request a vHost, type:

:/msg HostServ request vhost@goes.here

You will then have to wait for your vHost to be approved. Some networks do it automatically after about a few hours, while other nets have it to where it must be manually approved.

==Fun Things To Do On IRC==
*Abuse Channel Mode +f; for example set '''/mode #channel +f [1t#b]:999''' which will kick pretty much anyone saying anything in the channel.
*Put people in kickban loops; Join a channel, register it with ChanServ, do '''/cs akick #channel add *!*@*''', leave the channel, now type '''//raw join #channel $crlf mode #channel +e ~c:#(a channel that the targeted user is on) $crlf invite TargetUser #channel''' and watch.
*Abuse ChanServ privileges; a fun thing to do is clearing out the entire channel by doing /cs clear #channel users which kicks everyone from the channel. Alternatively, to cause more destruction, do '''/cs akick #channel add *!*@*''' then '''/mode #channel +e ~c:(a channel alot of people in the channel are also on)''' then '''/cs akick #channel enforce'''. This will send everyone in the target channel that is on the alternate channel you specified into an infinite kickban loop, as well as clearing everyone else out. (Note: On most servers you must use an extban ~c: because ChanServ will detect normal except masks and remove them)
*Abuse OperServ; go onto a populated channel and type '''/os akillchan kill +0 #channel Hi2u'''
