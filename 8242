The Holders
'''''The Holders''''' is a series of posts gathered from 7chan's /x/ board that tells of an epic quest to gather a [[shit nobody cares about|shitload of random items]] that, when brought together, are supposed to [[Apocalypse|end the world]]. Or something. People think it's [[serious business]].

==Information==
There's a website that someone made specifically for this series, namely [http://theholders.org this shit], which somehow finds all the posts on 7chan and puts them up in a database. It's supposed to be creepy, and a lot of it deals with people going [[insane|bat-shit crazy]] when they look for or find these items, but only [[idiot]]s get scared of shit like this. It's an interesting read if you want to waste some time that you'll never get back.

==History?==
Apparently there was some blind guy that they found these documents next to (which is retarded because they were supposed to be invisible by means of - no joke - a magic thumbtack, but it apparently isn't retarded that the guy was blind, fuckwit) when they found his body, which was being eaten by cats. Then some shit happened with his body disappearing and never being seen again while in transit to the government, go figure. There are supposedly 538 of these magic items, and if you get one, then you are doomed forever, they say.  The story is a blatant ripoff of ''House of Leaves'' by Mark Z. Danielewski.

==Formula==
All of the different sections that tell how to get the different objects have a very formulaic nature that at first seems a bit interesting, but eventually becomes too repetitive and boring for the stories to be creepy anymore.  The formula is:

*1. You go to a mental hospital and ask for "The Holder of X."  There's usually some kind of trick as to how you have to ask for them.
*2. You're led to a room or a door, and inside there's [[shit nobody cares about|another dimension or some shit]] that functions as a hallway.  You have to go to the end of it, and if you mess it up, you're fucked six ways since Sunday.
*3. In the next room, there's some asshole who has the item you want.  They are always either [[Chris-Chan|too hideous to look at]], or [[Perfection Girl|too beautiful to look away from]], but if you don't look straight at them the whole time, or never even glance at them (respectively) they'll kill the fuck out of you.
*4. You have to ask them [[what is a man?|a very specific question]], if you say anything else they will [[Cthulhu|swallow your soul and devour your mind]].
*5. They tell you something that is always too horrible to know [[lazy|(or write for that matter)]], then they either give you the object, or you have to kill them for it.
*6. This is object Y out of 538. It is Z.
*7. ????

There is no profit, just continual ???? because [[tl;dr|no one ever bothers to read all 538 of them]], so no one knows what's supposed to happen.

==How to become a Seeker==
A seeker is one who wastes their life looking for these magic things. All you have to do is be [[retard]]ed, really. It's not hard. If you go crazy, though, then you'll never die and instead waste the rest of eternity protecting your "precious." However, a [[some argue|common recommendation]] is that an aspiring seeker would be more useful by becoming [[an hero]] instead.

Summary of these "Holders" is [[tl;dr]].
