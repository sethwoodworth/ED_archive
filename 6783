Ragdoll Physics
[[Image:Mona.jpg|thumb|Ragdolls are sexy.]]

'''Ragdoll Physics''' is the result of a [[gaming]] industry crisis that occurred [[At least 100 years ago|about three years ago]], during which developers began to realize "''Oh [[shit]]! We suck, and are starting to run out of ideas for new games!''"

Luckily for them, [[pretty cool guy|some guy came along and invented Ragdoll Physics]]. This breakthrough caused the worldwide [[gamer]] population to quite literally soil itself in excitement.

==What is Ragdoll Physics?==
Ragdoll Physics is the game engine innovation of the century. It is truly amazing, and makes it possible for bodies to realistically fly through the air whilst having spasms in [[video game]]s, JUST LIKE A REAL [[Cock|RAGDOLL]]!!!

The advent of Ragdoll Physics effectively eliminated the need for the games industry to ever do anything new ever again, as 40-year-old [[basement dwellers]] the world over were powerless to resist the allure of that shiny "THIS GAME HAS RAGDOLL PHYSICS" sticker, lovingly affixed to every copy of ''Quake 7: Realistic Corpses Flying Through The Air Arena''. Needless to say the concept was a huge breakthrough and should be considered as a [[Forced_meme|brilliant contribution]] to gaming.

Note: Not to be confused with [[IRL]] [[Science#Physics|physics]], which does '''not''' cause those who die from gunfire to be propelled twenty feet into the air. It also makes them grow a 16 inch penis.

==Ragdoll Physics in Flash Gaming==
Ragdoll physics made an invaluable contribution to [[Flash]] gaming by allowing horrible [[Noobs]] to download a Ragdoll file and create a lovely game such as THROW RAGDOLL MAN AT THE WALL!!11!!! These beautiful groundbreaking games are then paraded around for everyone to see on such archives of incredible Flash as [[Newgrounds]].

I don't know if you've heard of this, but there is this totally amazing [[Flash]] file out there called [http://www.planetdan.net/pics/misc/tetka.swf tetka.swf] where this [[woman]] falls through bubbles[[Oneoneone|!!1!]] Everyone's heard of that you fucking retard. Wow, seriously, who hasn't heard of that? It's fun for about three minutes until you realize the chick isn't naked and she will not, EVER, hit the ground and splatter. Fucking waste of time.

==Haxx!!!11==
If the corpse in question touches anything other than the floor, it starts having violent convulsions like an epileptic retard.  In ''Postal 2'', you can make bodies explode because of this.
