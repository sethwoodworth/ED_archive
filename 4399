'''Jokestress''' (a.k.a. [[power word|Andrea James, n√©e James E. Mead]], a.k.a. [[Ann Coulter]]) is a [[wikipedophile]] and lantern-jawed [[transsexual]] who admits to have been an advisor for the movie TransAmerica. She is Lynn Conway's goon and an advocate for [[:File:Corn Dildo.jpg|trans fats]].

==Wikipedia==
Jokestress considers [[wikipedia]] the [[fully sick|most important]] thing currently happening on the [[internets]] and has made [[shitload|thousands]] of edits. She hates red links and has made [[over 9000]] new articles. Jokestress also uses the Wikipedia as a platform for [[Spam|promoting her businesses]].

==Other Shit==
Jokestress claims to have coached Felicity Huffman (a woman) for her role (pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman) in Transamerica and appears very briefly at the beginning of the film. He is also in a [[shitload]] of cheap documentaries that noone would ever watch and [[nerd|runs several websites about consumer issues]] including her website [http://www.tsroadmap.com/ The TS Roadmap] which has much information on [[transsexual|weird medical procedures for advanced fantasists]].

Jokestress evidently has a penchant for attacking young children, calling a nine year old girl a "cock-starved exhibitionist" and a five year old boy a "precious womb turd." Despite being out as a transsexual, for some reason, he has repeatedly had his birth name, "James E. Mead" removed from wikipedia, by his transsexual wikipedia buddies. Undoubtedly because James E. Mead accomplished some great things while genitals were still intact.

Jokestress transitioned for the lulz.
