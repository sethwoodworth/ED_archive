'''Staredog''' is a lightly forced, ultimately failed [[4chan]] meme that was popular on /b/ for a couple of weeks circa August, 2007. The meme consists of a picture of what appears to be a dog, apparently rigid and dead. There's really no proper or sensible way to use the Staredog image, just throw it in at random moments. Additionally, it makes a good [[Pic Unrelated|unrelated pic]].

Staredog recently re-entered the meme scene as the central feature of the [[Depression Dog]] image macro.

==History==
The Staredog image was just another of the endless stream of bizarre pictures that are spawned daily by this [[Internet|series of tubes]], but for some reason, [[Anon]] took particular interest in this pic and proceeded to [[spam]] it at every given opportunity. Being the [[I see what you did there|observant]] individuals they are, the channers noticed that Staredog had a sunken chin, much like their beloved [[Chin-chan]], which led them to deduce that Staredog must belong to her. Of course, it didn't take long for the imaginative, perverted minds of /b/ to call [[Rule 34]] on the pair; surprisingly, the call was answered, giving birth to one the oddest 34s in recent memory.  

Like many memes before him, Staredog appears to have started his life on [[b|/b/]], where he is occasionally the topic of [[debate]]. The first issue surrounding Staredog is determining whether he is actually a certifiable [[meme]]. Since the Staredog image has spawned numerous threads and been subjected to [[at least 100]] reposts and [[shoop]]s (including a [[Rule 34|34]]), one can assume that he is, in fact, a 4chan meme.

==The Name==
The second issue concerning Staredog is his name. While he has been referred to primarily as Staredog since his birth, it is sufficiently clear that this name is both uncreative and [[unfunny]]. The naming debate of Staredog has been compared to that of Grinman vs. [[Cockmongler]]. In [[fact]], one potential contender for the name is Cockmongrel. Others include [[Gay|Stare Mongrel and Nugle Dog]]. However, until another name has gained widespread use or agreement among /b/tards, Staredog shall remain Staredog.
