'''Aqua Teen Hunger Force''' is a [[not gay]] cartoon on Cartoon Network's [[gay]] [[Adult Swim]] programming block that is a thinly veiled attempt at dubiously playing into stoner and frat boy humor and functions as a prime marketing scheme in [[Forced_Meme|forcing memes]] in nearly every line of dialog. It features the misadventures of the Aqua Teen Hunger Force, a band of talking [[dick|meat]] and [[vagoo|non-meat]] fast food products. 

==The Great Show==
	[[Image:AquaTeens.jpg|thumb|right|[[Typical]] scene, before crazy shit happens.]]

The show consists of a talking [[black person|educated-monkey]] box of fries, an annoyingly [[Gay|high-pitched]] beverage container and a little spastic wad of meat.  Their [[fat]] disgruntled neighbor [[Chav|Carl]] is an exact portrayal of the loud and uncouth behavior of citizens in [[New Jersey]]. The plot of each show involves them sitting around the house and then some stuff happens.  No, [[srsly]]. These crazy events usually [[R. Lee Ermey|fuck them up]] (especially Carl) beyond recognition, as viewable in the gallery below.

==Mooninites==	

The Mooninites are two dysfunctional 8-bit sprites from the moon that try to skim through life solely by virtue of a massive superiority complex. The most popular of all the "villains", they steal the show with such stunts as landing in their pixel spaceship, involving Meatwad in their nefarious plans, and [[ATHF_Terrorist_Attack|terrorizing whole cities full of retards]] ([http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200702/s1838471.htm such as Boston]):	

After season 2 it was decided that the show's other antagonists [[Delete Fucking Everything|didn't matter]].
 		
==[[Party Hard]]==

This show actually likes to [[party hard]], and has a close relationship with talented composer Andrew W.K. If you want to sum up this show to [[newfag|somebody who has never seen it before]], show them this video:

==They Made a Movie or Something==
This video is [[unfunny]] compared to the show, but [[fanboy|fanboys]] might get a boner out of watching the creators talk about the movie.

==Fun Facts==	
[[Image:handbanana.jpg|thumb|[[Some argue]] that this is when the show <s>jumped the shark</s> cemented its place in history.]]		
*Once had an episode featuring a horrible [[Otherkin|dog-thing]] (named Hand-Banana by Meatwad) who's only purpose was to [[rape]] [[User:Brutananadilewski|Carl]] 		
*As in real life, many bizarre things happen to the Aqua Teens. Like dealing with talking mold and summoning a giant zombie chicken.	
*You can tell an ATHF [[fanboy]] apart from other fanboys by their incessant recitation of ATHF [[meme]]s, which make no sense whatsoever outside of their original context. Thus, ATHF fanboy-ism is often misdiagnosed as [[multiple personality disorder]] or [[schizophrenia]].
* ATHF makes memes funny. [[Rule 34|NO EXCEPTIONS]].
*ATHF holds the all time record for being the funniest show ever made. Ever.
*Once made an episode where they [[south park|said the word 'DICK' at least 100 times]].	
* Providers of the [[ATHF|Mooninite attack on Boston]].
* Explosions are the most important plot device.
