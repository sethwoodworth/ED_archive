'''Spam''' is a [[shit|delicious]] processed [[vagoo|luncheon meat product]] that [[your mom]] cooks with fucking everything. Spam is also a [[lying|legitimate]] form of [[advertising]] and a multi-million dollar industry that everyone loves to hate. [[Shit nobody cares about|Spam had its origin when authors like]] [[Fag|Alexandre Dumas]] [[Shit nobody cares about|were paid by the word to publish novels so they would be of ]][[Shitty|superior]] [[Shit nobody cares about|quality]]. Most spammers make an [[Prostitute|honest living]] out of reposting the same [[bullshit|quality content]] over and over again, ad infinitum, you know, until people [[Last Measure|really get the picture]]. Sadly, some people invoke actual wire, mail, and e-mail fraud laws to severely abuse these humble public servants simply trying to get the word out about their [[voodoo|new methods]] of curing [[erectile dysfunction]]. Some, however, spam with malicious intent on forums and message boards. Those people are [[cunt|huge cunts]].

Don't knock it. It's got its own key. Hormel Foods Corporation, the makers of spam, have revealed future revisions of their spam would use the latest in [[Computer Science III|128-bit public encryption technology]] for the cans, as the traditional key is insecure, especially as it is included with the can.

Three great characters to spam on board with character limits on their posts are the following : ፼ (U+137C), ₔ, and  (U+E366) (seriously, those are three single characters) because they are hueg liek Xbox and will allow you to cover more page area with the small character limit.

==Costs of Spam==
To quote [[TOW]], The European Union's Internal Market Commission estimated in 2001 that "junk e-mail" cost Internet users €10 billion per year worldwide.  It was estimated [[at least 100 years ago]] that spam cost [http://shop.netgrocer.com/ProductDetail.aspx?&sid=28811883&sid_guid=27509eea-24d0-42dd-9fdc-a6cdf7fcaf41&strid=2D462&pid=41387 Internet users] $3.85 per can worldwide.

# Because all the [[pretty cool guy|pretty cool kids]] are doing it.
# Because you are bored.
# Because you are a [[Faggot|respected, cool, fun to be around person]].
# Because you are a [[furry]].
# Because you are a [[troll]].
