Goggles was once a hilarious joke included in an episode of [[The Simpsons]]. Accordingly, due to the hilarity of this joke, goggles soon turned into [[forced meme|a meme of sorts]]. When posted, it creates minor [[lulz]], nothing more, and is therefore a textbook example of how [[The Simpsons]] used to be funny, and how we can have many [[lulz]] at the expense of [[Austria|Austrian]] people.

==Usage==
[[File:Googles.jpg|thumb|200px|<s>The goggles...they actually work!</s> wrong, look closer. THEY DO NOTHING!]]
Being the [[retard|tards]] that they are, /b/ [[I accidentally|Accidentally'd]] the meme. How you can use this meme without looking like a complete [[newfag]] is displayed in the following examples.

General Usage: ''' '' "The Goggles! They do nothing!" '' follows any showing of [[furry art]].'' '''

Proper Usage: ''' ''"My eyes! The goggles do nothing!"'' However, [[noone]] knows this and it's often misquoted.'' '''

If you wish to generate [[lulz]] from your friends, use this [[meme]] sparingly and appropriately. But don't be a [[fucktard]] by [[Milhouse]]ing it. Everyone knows [[forced meme]]s have a 100% fail rate.

Here is a [[Typical|typically]] good time to say it:
