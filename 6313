On the 18th of August, 2009, an Anon posted a thread requesting methods of trolling/getting money from a web designer. Said web designer thought he was talking to an underage girl (of like 11/12 years?).

Moralfags found out the pics posted had the kiddie fiddler's email/msn, and quickly reported the thread to him, allowing him to get away.

PedOwen now walks the streets, in search of that Loli, he knows that if there's a chance he might get in trouble, /b/ will protect him!

PedOwen, coming soon to a playground near you!

<p>You people are fucking disgusting. I hope deep down in your hearts you will wake up and realize what you did was wrong. I'm an innocent man with a wife, kids, and a great job that I wouldn't trade a way for the world. It's bloody disgusting the prank you tried playing on me. I was only playing a long the whole time because I thought "she" liked it. I'm not a paedo.</p>

<p>Hope you all rot in hell.</p>

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">

YOU FUCKING TRIED PRANKING ME, TRYING TO GET ME TO SHOW MY PRIVATE PARTS, TO TRICK ME INTO SOMEHOW ADMITTING THAT I AM PAEDOPHILE EVEN THOUGH IM NOT! Fuck off, this was childish and rediculous. I'm completely innocent. Go ahead, try calling the police, I'm an innocent man you bloody stupid fucks. I've got the whole conversation saved right here, they will see I was being lured!</p>

Now this is a story all about how

My life got flipped turned upside down

And I'd like to take a minute

While I sit right there

I'll tell you how I got to take a seat in that chair.

On MSN chat, born and raised

Lookin' at [[loli]] is how I spent most of my days

Chillin' out, relaxin', fappin' all cool

And molestin' some childrens outside of the school

When a couple of tards

Who were in for the [[lulz]]

Tried to make me show them my harbls

I got in one loli chat, but I was wrong

I said, "Fuck off asshole, I was only playing a long"
