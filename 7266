SaviorChan
[[Image:Delay_borg.jpg|right|thumb|Resistance is futile.]]

One day, the [[Patriotic Nigras]] had a wonderful idea. Combine one part [[xChan Directory Dumper]], one part [[botnet|IRC]], and approximately seventy-four parts [[win]] in a blender for 10 seconds, and you get SaviorChan. SaviorChan is the leading automated [[furfag]] extermination tool and has built-in presets for all of the most popular *chans, and some you may have never heard of.

== SaviorChan - The Chemo Curing /b/ ==

Although the PN knows that their main concentration of lulz is ''Second Life'', they still will fight and help destroy the furfag menace in other territories such as the dreaded newfag land of 4chan's /b/. [[At least 100 years ago]], the motherland had become a place of newfaggotry and failure, resulting in the mass exodus of many Anons. After moot began purging the cancer killing /b/, the PN retrieved some ancient thread spammers and set about to run the furfags and newfags from /b/, which resulted in massive win, but [[moot]] would later completely undermine the efforts by using his [[weeaboo]] magic to [[web 2.0|Gay 2.0]] the front page, thus bringing many of those newfags back.

Eventually, Nigra coders would modify the ancient spammers into a massive ShoopStar, which fires its [[delayclose]] laser beam at furfag threads, completely destroying them in a matter of minutes. This has caused a mass exodus of the two or three furfags that shitstorm /b/ at 3 in the morning and on Fridays.

Operation: Savior was born, and is still ongoing, becoming a part of [[The_Chemo_That_Is_Curing_/b/|the chemo that is curing /b/]].

== Operation: Savior ==

For a period of several months, the Patriotic Nigras and the Delayborg worked together to destroy the furfags on /b/. All furfag threads were carpetbombed and destroyed, allowing other threads to continue on in peace. At first, Friday was taken away from the furfags and reclaimed by the legion, so in retaliation the furfags started flooding 24/7, but this would not stop the delay swarm from hunting them down and purging their threads.

Eventually, a clever Nigra scientist discovered an exploit in the Yotsuba software that allowed SaviorChan to delete any post or thread instantly, and was used to hilarious effect until it was patched in a desperate attempt by moot to keep his furfag buddies from leaving.

=== Burning the Heretics - The PN Destroy Furrum ===

At some point, a butthurt furfag couldn't take it anymore and created a forum to try and coordinate furfag floods in an attempt to stop the Delay swarm and its cold, unfeeling, all-seeing eyes full of hate and exterminatus. Eventually, one of the furfags was dumb enough to post a link to their forum on the site during a Delay swarm bombardment, thinking that it would bring all of his furfag friends to the site in safety, but it instead alerted the Nigras to their faggotry.

As it turned out, the furfags had been coordinating the floods all along from this website, so the brave Nigras set out to purge Furrum. The first operation was standard doxing and humiliating, followed by a complete and total flood of every single board on the site. Then the delayborg activated and burned the website into nothing. In the end, all that was left were burned furfag corpses and a Page Not Found error screen.

Eventually, the Furrum admins put a page up admitting that they had lost and the glorious Nigras had won, destroying the furfag morale and eliminating the furfags once and for all, or so they thought. Later on, moot patched the post deleting exploit, which brought in a shitstorm of furfags and undid everything that SaviorChan had done for the past 5 months. In disgust, N3X15 dropped support for SaviorChan and declared Operation: Savior officially closed. The Nigras officially abandoned the established chans and set out to create their own: 915chan, which brought back the win of old.

== SaviorChan Gets OpenSourced ==

On August 19th, 2008, SaviorChan's coding, which had long been kept secret to keep it out of the hands of the furniggers, was [http://blog.patrioticnigras.org/index.php/2008/08/19/saviorchan-is-now-open-source/ officially opensourced] by the Nigras. This created instant lulz on the chans, as the sheer mass of the opensource delayborg swarm completely overwhelmed 4chan for several hours.

== SVN Requires Password ==
Rather as the SVN is password protected due to someone anonymously downloading Thuglyfe's sourcecode during development. The best way of getting the sourcecode for SaviorChan is to probably join PN on their [[IRC]] and try to get a copy.
