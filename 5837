'''Not4chan''' is where [[4chan]] and [[pedophile]]s intersect. As you can imagine, these subjects overlap heavily, and it is a very popular website. While the locals at not4chan try to fool everyone else by saying they only feature manga-style drawings of characters in their [[Teenager|teenage]] years from [[2007|the future...DUN DUN DUNNN!!!]], everyone can see the art on not4chan consists on drawings of little children. 

==Trolling Not4chan==
The best way to [[troll]] not4chan is to accuse them of being [[pedophile]]s, as they will do everything they can to deny it. In fact, they have invented a new word for themselves to try to disguise their true sexual preferences: "[[lolicon]]", which is Japanese for "pedophile". Of course, they will deny any connection.  

Another fun thing to do on not4chan is to post pictures of actual women with breasts; Although doing so will result in comments of "EW!", "WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE THINGS ON HER CHEST!" and "OH NO! A [[Your mom|REAL WOMAN]]!".

A third excellent and simple means of making the [[sick fuck]]s at not4chan go apeshit is to post links to their site.  [[Wikipedia|TOW]] and indeed ED both contain lengthy discussions in the [[relevant]] [[Talk:Not4chan|talk pages]] with pleas from the [[pedophile]]s asking for the removal of links. The given justification is always the same: that the link "attracts real child porn posters". This makes total sense, because most pedophiles start their hunt for pictures of naked children with online encyclop√¶dias, rather than sites that actually contain drawings of naked children.

Meanwhile, [[IRL]], the truth is that the folks at [[not4chan]] would rather have you believe that they can only be reached by [[The Matrix|taking the red pill]]. After all, they may be [[sick fuck]]s, but they're [[elitist|elite]], refined [[sick fuck]]s.

=="Anti-Lolikon Movement"==
On June 27, 2005, widespread panic erupted on Not4Chan when it was discovered that - GASP! - there is a conspiracy afoot against them!

<blockquote>Hey guys, I don't know if you are all up on what is going on out there, but it looks like our CP posters are not only posting here but on other loliboards as well. [[Renchan]] and UncutLoli have been hit like we are on a daily basis. Also, Not4Chan is popping up in conversation forums everywhere, from [[Slashdot]] to [[Dramapedia]] (where an entry for this site is made with "instructions" on the best way to attack and harass this board). It also looks like the CPer's post here then go announce we have CP here and we're a bunch of pedos and that's stuff is welcome here and we should be shut down for it. This is a calculated attack wave on many fronts, and it's another attempt to cleanse the net of this lolikon by making us look bad. I don't know what we can do about, but a storm is brewing out there and people are plotting against us. Just a heads up!</blockquote>

Hey buddy, how about taking your medicine and stop denying that you're a [[sick fuck]]?

At the moment, it seems Kommandant [[W]] has taken an anti-[[sick fuck]] position and attempted to [[ban]] loli with a law stating that any artistic depictions count as bona fide child pornography (this also makes [[Guro]] the drawn equivalent of a [[snuff]] film and making it a crime punishable by [[irony|death]]). The [[furfag|furfags]] at [[Fchan]] have also jumped on the b& wagon, removing all images and text references to [[Tails|underage furfag characters]]. Logically this should mean that say fake rape porn should get you place on the sex offenders list. How about plushy porn counts as bestiality; Or even better sex toys count as rape ((I mean they are at least as close to real people as a loli is to a real kid and the toy didn't consent))  

==Down==
For a short, happy period, not4chan seemed to have disappeared from the interwebs. Pedophiles everywhere had gone back to flooding [[4chan]] with loli and back to [[420 chan]]. The shutdown was due to a lack of funding on part of the admins, not a government [[conspiracy]].

As of 30 August 2006, Not4chan has [http://not4chan.us resurfaced]. It was later redirected to [http://not4chanserver.org Not4ChanServer]. In early 2007 it went down (probably [[Party V&]])  Not4chan.us is also down.

As of 11 July 2007, a [[spider expert]] tried to make sum money creating a fake not4chan at [http://notfourchan.net notfourchan.net] and then adding a shit-ton of ads everywhere. He believes that he has a good idea, but then anonymous found that he was lying. According to this [[fag]], he was the original owner of not4chan: 

{{quote|I am the same owner as the old "not4chan.us". You might be wondering why I don't have that domain anymore, but I lost it through godaddy, so I couldn't change the nameservers or anything. >( But, none the less, we're back and hope to stay up a lot longer than before because of a server this time! Get to postin.|Narunetto, who is now [[dead]].}}

As of Febuary 2010 the site's content was all all [[Delete fucking everything|removed]] due to the courts successfully found a man guilty for possessing [[lolicon]] without possesing any [[cp]]. Checkmate pedos.

==Reincarnation==
[[last_Thursday|Recently]], not4chan.org has re-incarnated itself into notfourchan.net in an attempt to escape trolling and the FBI. They still state that CP is illegal, though it appears and is NEVER deleted.
