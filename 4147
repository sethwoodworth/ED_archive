'''It's a Kirby, Retard''' is a [[meme]] originating from a news article originally published by the [[old media]] outlet ''The Daily Mail'' [[Unfunny|(moar liek the Daily <i>Fail</i> amirite?)]] covering [[Chris Brown]]'s apparent infringement upon [[Chris Chan]]'s [[shit nobody cares about|famous Pokemon medallion]].  An article about a filthy [[Islam|wife-beating]] black person would not normally be newsworthy, if not for the Daily Mail's blatant stupidity.  For you see, the publication erroneously categorizes Brown's medallion not once, but twice.  The title of the article refers to it as a [[Pokemon]] necklace, while the text refers to it as a [[cat]] necklace.  Normally, [[a cat is fine too]] would be applicable here; however, there is one very egregious mistake on the part of the Daily Mail that trumps even this rule.  

It's a Kirby, retard.

==Chris-Chan and Chris-Brown: the shocking similarities.==
*Slashfic inspired custom medallion.
*Striped shirt.
*[[Attention Whore|"Desperately seeks attention"]]
*Same fucking name.
*Both have a severe case of [[unwarranted self importance|USI syndrome]].
*Restraining orders from women.
*[[Gay|Completely and totally HETEROSEXUAL.]]

We can only assume that this will end in an intense race-war between the two.

[[No|Coincidence?]]

==Weev vs. The Daily Mail==
[[File:Kirbyfixed.jpg|thumb|right|Unfortunately they still think that Kirby is a cat.]]
Fortunately for us all, [[weev]] was on the case, and he called into The Daily Mail's office to demand a retraction.

{{quote|The worst journalistic fiasco I have ever seen in my life.|[[weev]]}}

{{audio|Weevchatswdailymail.mp3|Click here to listen to weev's call.}}

The Daily Mail was relatively unconcerned with this grave violation of journalistic integrity, promising weev that he would "get over it."  The Daily Mail would later change the title of the article, but leave the cat reference in the body, leading millions of unsuspecting readers to erroneously believe that Kirby is, in fact, [[lie|a pink cat]]. Ask for the online news desk at +44.02079386000 to demand the firing of whomever is responsible for this disgusting lack of source verification.
