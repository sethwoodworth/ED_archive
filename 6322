Peep Show, a britfag sitcom starring [[mac|Robert Webb]] and [[PC|David Mitchell]], proved itself to be the most awesome show in the history of [[old media]] when they successfully trolled [[Scientology]] and subtly referenced [[Anonymous]] and the [[magoo|"Old Guard"]] critics
It's the [[epic|final episode in the series]], and at long last Jeremy experiences a [[goatse|rare shaft of self revelation]]. After taking a [[bullshit|personality test]] he realizes that instead of the [[fail|brilliant musician]] that he thinks he is, he is  [[cock|"a misguided dickhead"]]. So he joins [[Scientology|a cult]] and changes out of all recognition - cleaning the kitchen (unasked), and wearing his shirts buttoned up to the collar.

Of course, they [[lie|aren't really]] talking about [[Scientology]]. Just that "Jez discovers a new lease of life after he and Super Hans join The New Wellness Centre, a way of life based on the seven sacred truths from the golden tablets found on the asteroid that crashed in Siberia 1911 and definitely not a cult".
