'''Jodie Foster''' is the [[Communist]] [[Dyke]] former [[Jailbait|child star]] who almost destroyed [[Democracy]] and the [[America|free world]] with her mosquito bite tits. Foster began her [[Pedo Baiting]] career at [[prostatot|the tender age of 3]], topless and baring her ass in a [[Ginger|coppertone]] commercial. This whorish behavior quickly lead to many fondly remembered roles in which she was raped and humiliated inevitably for the greater good of her [[Soviet Russia|soviet overlords]].

{{quote|Look, it's terrible, I know, but weakness really, really bugs me, to the point that if there is a wounded bird on the sidewalk, I look at it and I go: I think I'll just kick it.|Jodie Foster|Britain's Daily Mail}} 


==Doing it for the lulz==
Growing up in the [[money|Jew gold]] encrusted hills of LA and being [[roman shower|showered]] with critical acclaim Foster was afforded many luxuries such as a life-time of sexual abuse. This caused a natural progression toward [[lesbian]]ism, [[atheism]] and [[communism]] which were further cemented by dating [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000281/ Scott Baio] and inventor of the celebrity [[pedophile]] porn video, [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000507/ Rob Lowe].

At the barely-legal age of 18 all Foster's systematic abuse finally paid off when she convinced a stalker by the name of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hinckley,_Jr. John Hinckley] to assassinate [[Ronald Reagan]]. When asked what the fuck he was thinking by [[police]] Hinckley replied that "I did it to impress Jodie Foster". Of course when confronted in court the whore said "I don't have any relationship with John Hinckley". He threw a pen at her and yelled "I'll get you, Foster!"

This [[retarded|entirely reasonable]] response spawned a pre-[[internets]] meme which was the primary precursor to [[I did it for the lulz]]. From that moment forward mindbogglingly insane shit could be explained by claiming it was done to to impress Jodie Foster. There is even a [[Raptor Jesus|pre-historic]] punk band named [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFA_%28band%29 Jodie Foster's Army].

==Singing Career==
For some retarded reason Foster went to a French speaking school in America and has native fluency. From [[common knowledge]] scientists have acknowledged that as French-ness increases, the likelihood of homosexuality approaches 1.

What is not explained by this video is how someone so French is dressed so poorly, alas Dyke > French. It is highly recommended that you [[Michael Jackson|bathe in bleach]] after witnessing this atrocity.

==Almost Raped==
The patron saint of the [[almost raped]]. Since the beginning of time this bag of bones has been raped and almost raped again and again in every second movie that exists.

|Almost Raped

|-
|The Hotel New Hampshire
|1984
|3
|Rape, Almost Raped, Furry Rape
|A movie offensive in every possible way, it could best be described as "Law and Order: SVU" crossed with "The Benny Hill Show". This movie is almost worthy of an article it's own and is basically the internet in movie form, it contains incest, rape, a furry, rape, homophobia, rape, lesbian kissing and plenty of rape, all in the early 80's. It reduces a scene in which is gay guy is beaten up and gets mud shoved up his ass into wacky shenanigans. It also contains characters including a lesbian, furry, attempted rapist who turns straight, a clown who commits suicide, a midget who commits suicide and a stuffed dog who is put to sleep without permission the morning before it's owner, Jodie, is raped, in her strangest rape scene to date.
|-
|The Accused
|1988
|1
|Gang Rape, Almost Raped
|This boring made for TV movie was escalated to infamy when Jodie Foster encouraged the director to make it more graphic, which it still is by today's standards. It tells the tale of a young rape victim who takes the onlookers to court for cheering on the attack.
|-
|The Silence of the Lambs
|1991
|1,000,000
|Almost Raped
|In this story, FBI trainee Clarice Starling is used as delicious bait by her boss to get Hannibal Lecter to help save a kidnap victim. An underlying theme in the movie is that Clarice is small and vulnerable and creepy old guys keep hitting on her. While Hannibal never rapes her, it's pretty clear he would eat her genitals, [[Biting Beaver|which is technically rape]].
|-
|Little Man Tate
|1991
|2
|Almost Raped, Visual Rape

In the movie he walks around a University campus alone and is befriended by Harry Connick Jr. who takes him to a bar hoping to film a sequel to The Accused. The next day the kid shows up at Connick's dorm and witnesses some avid sexing which legally constitutes eye rape.
|-
|Sommersby
|1993
|1
|Asking for it
|In this movie, Jodie's husband returns from the civil war... or does he? The answer is no, at the end it's revealed he's a kind-hearted conman who looks almost exactly like her husband for no explicable reason. She reveals that she knew all along due to not being retarded, and she likes her men to be dangerous aka abusive rapists.
|-
|Maverick
|1994
|1
|Almost Raped
|In this movie, Jodie is convinced by [[Mel Gibson]] that a group of dangerous Native Americans want to kidnap her for non-consensual sexual purposes but not to fear because he will take her place. This was actually untrue, he was friends with them and just wanted to impress her.

|1994
|2
|Rape, Almost Raped
|Jodie plays Nell, a woman who's lived in the wilderness with her mother for her whole life and never met anyone else.

At first Nell is terrified of men as her mother taught her that penises were "daggers in the belly" but she gradually loses this fear and is almost raped in a bar.
|-
|Contact
|1997
|1
|Asking for it
|If traveling to a strange planet to meet aliens with unknown motives isn't asking for an anal probe I don't know what is.
|-
|The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys
|2002
|1
|Almost raped
|The sexual suggestiveness of this movie's title is palpable, though misleading. Jodie has a small role as the comic relief, a nun who discovers that the stars of the movie have been writing a comic book in which she is an evil character drawn being fucked in various sexual positions. After she confiscates it, the boys concoct an elaborate scheme to kill her with a mountain lion, but fail when one of them is killed by it.
|-
|Panic Room
|2002
|1
|Almost Raped
|In this movie, there is a scene in which Jodie's daughter, fellow closet case [[Kristen Stewart]], is in a room with two burglars, one of whom wants to kill her/possibly rape her. The second one however doesn't want to hurt anyone and protects her from the psycho.
|-
|Flightplan
|2005
|1,000,000
|Almost raped
|In Flightplan Jodie's five-year-old daughter is kidnapped during a flight, assumedly by a pedophile. To quote Jodie in the movie "People do things to little girls, sick things, you know that!" In the end it turns out she was kidnapped by crew members for reasons too complicated and retarded to explain.
|-
|Inside Man
|2006
|1
|Asking for it
|Jodie has a very small role as an infamous bitch who specializes in getting rich people out of trouble for a huge fee. Half way through the movie, about a bank robbery, she goes inside the bank to find out if the robbers are looking for information that incriminates her client. It turns out that they are and she leaves empty handed. You'd have to be a retard to go into a bank during a robbery, anything could happen.
|-
|The Brave One
|2007
|5
|Almost raped, Asking for it
|In her most obvious rape film in years, Jodie's fiancee is murdered by a gang and she is beaten within an inch of her life after he stops them from raping her. She then goes on to use herself as live rape bait, killing all who try to fuck with her.
|-
|Nim's Island
|2008
|0
|Almost raped, Asking for it
|This may be a child's movie, but that won't stop the rape themes. Jodie plays a reclusive and batshit crazy author who travels half way across the world with only her imaginary friend to save a girl she's never met. Anyone with half a brain would know it's extremely dangerous to travel alone, especially for women and especially in the countries she travels to. There are many scene's where she is alone with a random large black man who luckily doesn't try to fuck her a new cunt. Completely retarded.
|-
|The Beaver
|2010
|?
|Right in the beaver
|I don't even care what it's about it's fucking called The Beaver LOL
