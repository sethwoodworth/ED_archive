'''Auto-erotic asphyxiation''' is a common way to murder someone and make it look like a suicide (e.g. [[David Carradine]]).

You know how, some days, you want an extra kick to your [[fap]]? Maybe you get it by sticking something [[in the pooper|in ur pooper]], maybe you get it by hooking a car battery up to your nuts, or maybe you get it by picking up homeless [[loli|girl]]s to dissect while you [[I came|cum]] in their knife wounds. The point is [[you]] get it. Some people get their kick from strangling themselves while they bust a nut, an act known as auto-erotic asphyxia (or 'scarfing', lol).

Some people think pro wrestler [[Brian Adams|Brian "Crush" Adams]] died from performing this weird [[fuck]]ing shit on himself, though [[the man]] said it [[bullshit|had nothing to do with his]] [[IRL]] [[permaban]].

[[Tory]] MP Stephen Milligan, in a case that tests the line of what constitutes [[win]] and [[fail]], [[IRL]] was found dead with what the [[old media|BBC]] called "a black bin liner over his head" and buck-ass naked save for some suspenders. Although he obviously [[I did it for the lulz|did for the lulz]], his [[epic]] [[pwnt|self-pwnage]] easily earns him a spot in the [[Budd Dwyer]] wing of the [[an hero]] Hall of Fame. Also, the former lead singer for [[eighties|INXS]], Michael Hutchence, [[shit nobody cares about|was alleged to have died in this manner]], but no one was surprised given the fact that he was from [[Australia]] and therefore classified as [[retard|legally retarded]].
