Creepypasta
[[image:Creepy_Thread.jpg|right|350px]]
'''Creepypasta''' is the internet definition for short stories designed to unnerve, disturb, elicit a negative emotional response from, and scare the reader. As with anything found on the internet, the quality varies wildly from one example to the next, so we here at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] decided to categorize all of the creepypasta we could find, as well as the various related [[memes]] and websites. Please find below links to our Creepypasta collections, related pages, media and external sites. Try not to cry, because that won't do any good..

=Our Creepypasta Collection=

The collection of actual creepypasta has expanded enough to practically fill its own [[wiki]], so we have categorized it into some popular genres and used our very own creepometer to seperate the truly terrifying from the terribly trite.

*<big>'''[[Creepypasta/Awesome_Creepypasta|Awesome Creepypasta]] is Awesome.'''</big>

The best of the best in Encyclopedia Dramatica's learned opinion, awesome creepypasta will send shivers down the Creepy Connoisseur's spine.

*<big>'''[[Creepypasta/Mediocre Creepypasta|Mediocre creepypasta]] is close, but [[lesbian|no cigar]].'''</big>

95% of all creepypasta out there falls into this category, worth a read if the awesome ones have got you yearning for more.

*<big>'''[[Creepypasta/Retarded Creepypasta|Retarded creepypasta]] is retarded. Waste your time if you want.'''</big>

Often worth it just for shits and giggles, retarded creepypasta contains some of the most unintentionally hilarious one-liners and plot devices known to man. You may shit yourself, but only with laughter, and only if you can barely control your bowels under normal circumstances anyway..

*<big>'''[[Creepypasta/Lengthy Creepypasta|Lengthy creepypasta]] is girthy, too.'''</big>

More short stories than pieces of true [[copypasta|pasta]], for the creepy lover who prefers to be immersed in the story.

*<big>'''[[Creepypasta/Mirrors and Creepypasta|Mirrors]] feature prominently'''</big>

The [[rich and beautiful|beautiful]] aren't afraid.

*<big>'''[[Creepypasta/Paranormal_Creepypasta|Paranormal Creepypasta]]'''</big>

For the fantasist, ghouls and beings are rampant.
