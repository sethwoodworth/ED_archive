Deadfrog
Deadfrog is a repository that many /b/tards, [[Weeaboo]] scum, emo kids and any other description of Anonymous use regularly for a go-to when they believe something they have is worth [[torrent|torrenting]].

Deadfrog is run and maintained by Token, a self confessed Linux Nazi, who has claimed to be [[Texas|Texan]], [[black]], Spanish, [[Germany|German]], [[United States|American]], Italian, Pedo and an Ohio Browns Backer(in roughly that order). One of his redeeming qualities, enforced heavily throughout the site ( with the noticeable exception of the tracker itself), is the completely zero tolerance approach to furries and [[furry]] content.

Deadfrog is also a repository of [[lolicon]] in various forms, not the least being the hidden image boards and not-so-hidden imageboards.

== UNDER NEW MANGEMENT ==

Deadfrog was acquired by cheesey, admin of [[Renchan#Flatchan (Renchan_2: Electric Boogaloo)|Flatchan]] (formally [[Renchan]]) for $80 ontop of the $60 it takes to run Flatchan.

 '''PROTIP:''' ''You should [[DDOS|packet]] both to skyrocket those costs''
