'''Bing''' is a [[crap|carp]] search engine and the brain-fart of [[Bill Gates]]'s malaria addled brain. Launched in [[2009]] as an alternative to the [[Google]], Bing's [[USI|mission statement]] is that it is a "[[what|decision engine]]" that will [[pwn]] Google's market domination by offering fewer results and less [[harbl|clutter]] delivered via in interface of pretty pictures. Yeah, good luck with that Bill...

Bing is named after [[pr0n]] star [http://www.freeones.com/html/c_links/Carmella_Bing/ Carmella Bing] because it sucks a lot of cock and so does she.



==Mission Staement==
Bing argues (and spams TV with gay ads) that searching for anything on Google to akin to searching for a needle in a haystack -something it calls "[[Overload Syndrome]]". Since [[Google]] does (indeed)- cough up millions of random, tangential results from every single blog, [[shitter]] post and forum on the Interwebs as alleged information, bing has a point. However, since the human race is already hardwired to use Google for everything, [[nobody cares]] about bing. Plus since [[wikipedia:Google_(verb)|Google is now a verb]] listed in the [[fact|Oxford English Dictionary]], the chances of "'''Googling'''" being replaced by "'''Binging'''" are slim to none.

==Workarounds==
Bing's default filter setting is [[SFW|Moderate]]. This means it is supposed to block [[NSFW]] images and vidyas, but '''not text'''. Ergo, ED should be all up in your grill without having to fuck with it, however, Bing is made of [[faggotry]] and [[FAIL]] so you have to turn it to '''Off''' and [[win|Bob's your uncle]].

==Meanwhile==
Meanwhile, you can search for [[porn]] without adjusting the filter and get [[hypocrisy|plenty of hardcore pr0n links from Bing]]. Go figure.

==Bing Works==
[[File:Searching_bing_sucks.png|thumb|800px|center|Searching for "bing sucks" with the filter off, Bing cuts through the crap and gets [[porn|specific results]] relevant to [[fap|our interest]].]]

==Google vs Bing==
