Loser
'''''Whoops!''''' Were you looking for [[You]]?

[[Loser]]s don't [[win]]. This is why they were dubbed losers [[at least 100 years ago|at the beginning of time]]. Losers are composed primarily of lose and [[fail]] with a dash of [[gay]] for flavoring. Losers are [[luser]]'s [[IRL]] counterpart. Generally when someone loses they try to make it look like they didn't lose. This is usually done in the form of denying it entirely, changing what they said, playing dumb, etc. Losers were originally put on earth by [[Raptor Jesus]] to test the [[cool]] people but they grew beyond his control. After the Tower of [[bible|Babel]] he put them into separate folders for easier management.

==The origin and history of losing==

Losing began [[at least 100 years ago]] when that fucktard Eve plucked the [[fruit]] of the knowledge of good and [[evil]] from the tree of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. This was the most monumental act of lose of all time. In her defense, however, [[Raptor Jesus]] did put it in the middle of the garden. The next act of lose was committed in Sodom & Gomorrah where everyone was so gay that they tried to [[molest]] one of God's angels. This infuriated God so much that he burned all the residences of these two cities, except Lot, alive. Skipping ahead a couple years lets look at [[Abraham Lincoln]]. A man made of so much lose that he thought [[niggers]] feelings were more important than money. John W. Booth put this fallacy as right as could be, by popping a cap in Lincoln's ass. Doing this put Booth amongst the [[winnar|WinRars]].

==How to avoid an loser==

[[Image:Losers-and-depression.jpg|thumb|right|Totals may exceed 100% as many losers hit the GRAND SLAM.]]

This is a little harder than the [[OL]] version of these [[penis|pricks]]. Losers IRL tend to be dressed [[Put shoe on head|in a manner]] outside the stipulation of known cliques. Their favorite way of doing this is mixing the wardrobes in ways that offend the eyes. Like a handle, however, if a not-loser dressed or buys the cloth for the loser then it will be harder to spot them. Just hang around them for a while, ''around'', mind you. Don't get too close. A loser tends to make its presence known within seconds of being around another [[human]]. Once the loser has revealed himself, throw the bucket of c[[oral]], [[cutting|razors]] and salt, which you should have on you at all times, at his head. This is the losers' natural deterrent and should dispense of him post-haste.

[[Image:Losersorg.jpg|thumb|An organization for losers.]]

'''[http://www.losers.org/ Losers.org]''' is a [[Web 1.0]] website founded [[at least 100 years ago]]. Hell, it is believed it dates back from the 1990s. [[old|The 1990s]]! Its main purpose, as its name suggests, is to document the [[loser]]s, [[freak]]s and [[weird]]os of the [[internets]], although it hasn't been updated since fuck knows when. In this sense, it is like a prototype for an early [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], [[seeking]] out the most [[lulzworthy]] strange people that they could find, and also being an early form of [[user-generated content]] as the site relied on user submissions to find these people.

Most of the people featured had their own [[Geocities]] or [[Angelfire]] pages, or their ISP's web service free hosting. As a result, many of the links have suffered from [[Wikipedia:link rot|link rot]], and [[fail]] to deliver lulz. Having said that, it's still a good early attempt at [[lulz archiving]], and still contains a small number of losers whose sites have not gone offline (although these are in the minority), such as that [[Peter Pan]] guy, who is classed as a five-star loser. Losers.org is separated into several different categories, and as such is neatly organized so that you [[lie|do not have to wade through]] a load of [[TL;DR]] [[shit]].
