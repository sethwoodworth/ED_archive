'''Biting Beaver''' is the online handle of a 34 year old [[womyn|cumdumpster]] from [[Ohio]] with strong, fundamentalist beliefs in [[Nazism | feminism]]. When her son Brandon hit puberty, she was disgusted to discover that a lifetime of [[bullshit | feminist indoctrination]] was no match for his libido, as Brandon had no qualms about looking for [[win | porn online]]. BitingBeaver claims that Brandon was the product of [[asking for it | marital rape]] and now regrets the fact that she didn't abort him. She believes that he will eventually become a rapist, and may be considering other methods of filicide at this very moment.

As  a moderator of the WomensSpace forums, BitingBeaver [[Cyberrape|posted her thoughts]] on this matter in July 2007. When this insane thread was discovered by a female member of the [[SA]] forums, it sparked a [http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2576071 lengthy discussion over there] as well, and several trolls from SA visited WomensSpace to reply to BitingBeaver. This thread was eventually deleted by [[Cheryl Lindsey Seelhoff|Cheryl "Heart" Seelhoff]], the founder of WomensSpace. In an effort to portray herself as a sympathetic victim, Seelhoff reprinted threats issued by the trolls in a blog post, but completely ignored the larger issue of BitingBeaver's treatment of her children. Outraged, [[Anonymous]] launched an attack against the bandwidth of Seelhoff's servers, sparking a minor conflict between [[Legion]] and RadFems that lasted through the first half of August 2007. Feminist bloggers are now using the event to claim that all women are being targeted and oppressed on the web. ''For more information on the attacks, read [[Cheryl Lindsey Seelhoff]]''

In the aftermath of the attacks BitingBeaver has set her blog to invite only, as it was small personal details included there that led Anonymous to her. However [http://www.oneangrygirl.net/ One Angry Girl], a rabid anti-porn feminazi, has recently set up [http://archiveofthebitingbeaver.wordpress.com/ an archive of BitingBeaver's ramblings] for everyone to enjoy. Commenting there is disabled, but its a chance to see [[batshit insane|feminazi]] [[RAGE|ranting]] straight from the mouth of BitingBeaver herself.

[[Anonymous]] is very concerned about Brandon's well-being and won't stop until they find him. [[Some argue|They argue]] that he needs to be warned that his mom wishes she had [[abortion | stabbed him with a coathanger]], and that he will always be a [[sick fuck]] in the eyes of his mother. If you have any information regarding Brandon's identity or whereabouts, please contact Anonymous immediately. Everything you are about to read between this line and "[[#The Search for Brandon|The Search for Brandon]]" are actual [[batshit insane]] quotes from BitingBeaver, unless otherwise noted.

[[Image:armdick.jpg | thumb | left | She sees things about her son that only a mother could see.]]

''"Several years ago [[bullshit|my accountability]] program found that the computer had been accessing pornography. Turns out it was my middle son. To date he has been 'caught' accessing pornography many times since then. He was 13 I think when this started.

''"I [[b&|banned]] him from the computer, but after a few months I would allow him to be on it for short periods of time. Each and every single time my son would access pornography within days (and sometimes hours) of being allowed back online. He was aware that he would be caught because the computers are monitored but he chose to do it anyway.

''"Most recently my youngest son allowed my middle son to play with his PSP. Brandon (the middle child) used it to immediately access pornography online. The child is now banned from computers, video games and so forth. I've talked until I'm blue in the face, I've grown angry and yelled, [[BAWWWW|I've cried when I was alone and when I was in front of him]]. I've had him read [[Propaganda|Dworkin]], my site, and other places (namely OAG's site) and I still can't unseat this problem. He can recite feminist literature all day long, he can understand the tenets, the ideas behind it, how it links together but [[Row row fight the powah|he will not allow this knowledge to stand in the way of his porn use]].

''"I don't think I'm looking for advice (I've tried everything I could think of so far) [[butthurt|but more a place to simply be sad]]. [[Doing it wrong|I can clearly see why he's looking at pornography, I've figured all that out readily enough]], but I can't seem to make it stop.

[[Image:Biting_beaver_fursona.gif | thumb | Her blog features BitingBeaver's [[fursona]] sucking dick, represented by the wooden [[penis]].]]

''"I know, that as soon as my child leaves my home and moves into his own place that he will be looking at porn immediately. I know that I am raising a problem for women. I know that this child will one day grow and will fully absorb the messages that porn sends to men. I know that my child masturbates to [[wut|degradation]] of '''[[Feminazi|my people]]''' (when I use that phrase I mean (womyn) and that with every orgasm he will further [[Your resistance only makes my penis harder!|solidify]] his own hatred of and superiority over, women.

''"'''I know that there will likely come a day where my son coerces a young woman into sex (rape)''' and there isn't a damned thing I can do about it. I look into the eyes of my son and they still sparkle like they did when he was a baby, but he's not a baby anymore, he's growing into a man and that man will have trained himself to degrade women before he leaves my home.

''"As a [[Batshit_insane|'''radical''']] feminist who puts women first I cannot begin to determine what I should do with regards to this issue. My heart breaks because there is nothing I can do to protect the womyn he will come into contact with.

''"'''I have three boys. One of them is lost to me''' and as a mother and a [[retarded|radical womyn]] this breaks my heart in a way I can scarcely express. I don't know if it says something terrible about me, but you know what haunts me late at night? More than anything else? I know, in my heart of hearts that, knowing what I know now, '''if I had it to do over again I would have had that abortion.'''

''"I also find myself blaming myself over and over again, even though that radical womyn inside of me [[Doing it wrong|stands up and yells that I'm placing blame in the wrong place]]. I'm not sure what I intended to say with this message. I began writing it this morning and put it away again and finally decided to finish it this evening. I think that maybe I just wanted to share, I keep trying with Brandon and I keep [[fail|failing]].

''"Societally we, as mothers and womyn, are expected to have this sort of unconditional love for our offspring.

<br>
''"I also find myself blaming myself for his habits and that horrifies, shames, and angers me. Brandon was the product of [[asking for it|marital rape]] (something he doesn't know and I will very likely never tell him).

|''"Because he belongs to the privileged group he was able to turn around and kick women who are the culturally acceptable repositories for all male violence. '''Through women Brandon was able to feel better about himself the easy way, by kicking someone lower than he was'''. At the moment, it all comes back to Brandon's own self-loathing and feelings of inadequacy. Through porn he is told that males (and by extension him) are inherently more worthy than at least one other group of people....Brandon is terrified of losing favor with any male, and so the logical conclusion of his behavior is to put as much distance as himself between the lowest of the low (female) and himself. '''This includes masturbating to their pain as a reinforcer of his own higher (and thus safer) status.'''"''|'''BitingBeaver'''}}</small></center>

:''"I have been lax, far too lax, in talking to my boys about this crime. In impressing on them the knowledge that it does happen. It happens to women all over the country and not just by evil monsters who are hiding in dark corners of alleyways, but by and large by men that the women know. By men, who very often don't think they've committed a crime when they're finished. I have bought into the idea that, "My boys are good boys, they've been raised by a hell-bent-for-equality-Feminist. My boys know that rape is wrong, they know the many forms that rape takes. They know better. But how? How do they know better? '''I mean, honestly, have I spent any 'real' time talking about rape to them?'''"''

:''"Sure, I've spent lots and lots of time telling them how fashion is sexist, how words have power. '''They can spot sexism and misogyny in video games and movies. They try to speak up against the boys in school who they see sexually harassing girls.''' Yet, as is evidenced by my eldest’s reaction last night, '''it's not enough.''' I have to voice it, I have to speak it's name to make it real, to show them it's a crime, that it's a painful, horrible, degrading experience that comes in many forms. I have to speak to them to let them know that rape is committed by men of all walks of life, even by boys whom they label as friends. '''Until 'I' can talk to them, they can't learn.'''"''

:''"I, as their parent and number one source of information about women, must take the time to tell them what constitutes rape, what rape is. It's my job to tell them that No means No. '''If I wait for others to do it''' it simply will not get done and '''I'll be turning a man loose in this society whom I cannot vouch for'''. We simply don't want to believe that our boys are capable of such atrocities but we, as Mothers and Women, have a responsibility to own the fact that if they're men, they're capable, unless and until we tell them otherwise. I don't know how to do it, I have no earthly idea how to tell my children about rape. I don't want to think about it, I've spent my life refusing to think about it, but now I have to think about it. '''I have to think about it so that my son's [[you don't have any friends|high-school prom date is safe'''."'']]

:''"My boys are good boys, they're smart boys, but they are boys and as such, the Patriarchy want them. The '''Patriarchy is doing it's level-best to assimilate my boys and bring them into the folds of Male Power''' and Privilege and it's my job to put the spark of empathy, the fire of self-determination and respect into their young minds to make women safer. To make their wives and girlfriends and fuck buddies safe from them, because '''left unchecked they could rape, they already have the [[Cock|equipment]].'''"''

== Morality Clauses, EC, And Broken Condoms ==

Last year, BitingBeaver became [[E-famous]] following  a rant about the difficulties of getting the morning-after pill in Ohio on a night that her condom broke, as most hospitals wouldn't provide one except in the case of rape. She dismissed the potential fetus as nothing but a parasite and wrote about the experience in [[BitingBeaver/MoralityClausesECAndBrokenCondoms|Morality Clauses, EC, And Broken Condoms]], which received over [http://www.haloscan.com/comments/bitingbeaver/115858795922810512/ 467 comments].

To top it all off, the morning-after pill she eventually managed to take did fail, she got pregnant, then planned her abortion... To fund it, she actually [http://pandagon.blogsome.com/2006/10/07/the-beaver-and-the-plan-b-saga-continued/ started a PayPal account to take donations], and like-minded feminist bloggers flocked to support her. Little did they know that Biting Beaver supported abortion well into the 42nd trimester.

:''"Finally, I spoke to him. Finally, I told him that I was tired of BDSM. I told him I longed for the days when he had actually made love to me. When he was tender without ropes, without chains, without pain and spit and whips. I cried. I asked him, in my desperation that day, to “Please, just make love to me. '''Please make love to me''' now, prove to me that you still can.” I told him I needed, craved, desired a gentle touch without pain.

:''"'''He tried. Until he entered me''', then his hand crept to my neck and there it was, the same old dominance. '''He squeezed my neck''' and I was gasping for air as my head got light. I cried as he ‘made love’ to me and the tears flowed freely down my face before dropping onto his hand. He kissed the tears away as I cried and it was then that I realized that this was not love. He was incapable of love and I wondered and [[FYIAD|'''I heard my warrior crying out to me''']], I heard her words from across the divide and my heart sank and my tears dried as he finished the act."

== BitingBeaver's Rape Checklist ==

Disappointingly, BitingBeaver's Rape Checklist is '''not''' a list of things one needs to commit a successful rape and get away with it (much as her name is not representative of a favourite activity as much as a threat).

Items on the list include:

* #14 - If you convince her to have sex with you, you're a rapist?
* This and over 50 other ways that you just might be a rapist are listed in [[BitingBeaver/RapeChecklist|Biting Beaver's Rape Checklist]], written by Biting Beaver herself a few years back
*It should be noted that the Rape Checklist is insanely [[tl;dr|tl;dr]]. It basically boils down to a few points. If you rape someone, you are a rapist. You remain a rapist after raping someone. If you continue to rape you are a rapist. If you stop half-way in the rape you are still a rapist.
*The list's similarity to [[furfag|Jeff Foxworthy]]'s "You might be a [[redneck]]" [[Unfunny|jokes]] are [[lie|completely coincidental]]. The difference is that the Rape Checklist is actually [[lulz|funny]]. 

== Identifying BitingBeaver In The Wild ==

* When talking about [[pity sex|consensual sex]], will use the term <b>"sex (rape)"</b> every time.

{{squote|Every time I think about it I refer to this fetus as a 'parasite', a 'tick' and other things I won't even mention.|[http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous_conservative/2006/10/wackjob_alert_t.html BitingBeaver]}}

* BitingBeaver has recently been confined to the [[In_the_kitchen|kitchen]] because she hallucinated that anonymous was '''[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Biting_Beaver/forest chasing her around a dark forest one night.]'''

{{squote|The coyotes closing in around me brought smiles to my lips and a sense of wonder and childlike safety and good humor. The thought of a group of young [[rape|men]] sneaking into the park after hours to drink a stolen or illegally bought 6 pack of beer was '''bone chilling.'''

* Many years ago, BitingBeaver tried to spice up her sex life with her second husband.

{{squote|I became a divided woman. When he came to me in the morning and put the nipple clamps on me I knew that I was not free.

{{squote|I think that the first time I felt ‘real’ terror was when I looked down at him with a needle in his hand, poking into the skin of my nipple, drawing blood, threatening to pierce it.

== The Search for Brandon ==
[[Image:Bbmapsearch.jpg | thumb | Tiny details like living in the "glacial valley" were used against BitingBeaver to locate her son.]]
{{Quote | I wanna say, "Lady! Get outta your kid's crotch! | Anonymous | 8/11/07}}
[[Image:Bbphotosearch.jpg | thumb | Barn + Trashy Pond + Failure Gazebo + Google Earth = Win]]

Searching for Brandon spanned the course of 5 days of intense combat between August 4 and August 8, 2007 by the ground troops of Anonymous. Searching spanned 3 continents as Amerifags called in support from Europe and [[Russian Reversal | the Soviet Union]]. The stakes were high on the [[battlefield]], as every Anonymous knew that the freedom of one of their own was up for grabs.

"Dozens, possibly hundreds of articles, blogs, County Clerk's files, websites, and forums" were searched for any key clue or shred of evidence that may give the whereabouts of their lost man. The [[internet hate machine]] was online for 24 hours a day as details became available. Like [[Hal Turner | those]] [[Alex Wuori | before him]], every detail was cross-referenced to others that were found and well documented.

In the midst of all of this, some very lulz comments came out.

:''"Lol, The thread title said war effort and there was a bunch of maps and I was like. What the hell (are we) doing. Gonna go take over Ohio?"'' - [[Anonymous]] Day 4, 8/7/07

:''"You know what's fucking awesome? This Brandon kid has no fucking idea that he's the target of so much attention. He probably sat at home all day watching TV while we fought for him."'' - [[Anonymous]] Day 4, 8/7/07

Knowing Brandon, he probably sat and watched porno.

:''"I feel so epic for helping in this. Brandon MUST be freed or find someway to contact him. It is only a matter of time until we can reach out and free him from the ropes of his mother's tentacle and teeth-fill vagina."'' - [[Anonymous]] Day 4, 8/7/07

Some of us are putting together a care package for Brandon for when we find him, if you want to upload some pornz for him, go to 

<del>[http://voter5.info/freebrandon/ http://voter5.info/freebrandon/]</del> and upload away.

Meanwhile, at [[I/|/i/nfidel]] HQ hidden underneath Euro[[Disney]] in Paris, France, [[Anonymous]] located a neighbor of BitingBeaver, floondi, and we are closer than ever to contacting Brandon. [[Fox News|Video at a 11]].  Brandon's mom [[MILF|''has got it going on'']], and most of [[Anonymous|anon]] believe he should [[rape|have sex with]] her. As of August 26, 2007, nothing moar has happened. [[/b/]] has thus far ceased in its efforts to deliver.

==Things We've Learned from BitingBeaver==
* Looking at porn means you hate women.
* Looking at porn means you are a future rapist.
* Looking at porn means that your mother should have aborted you.
* Sex = Rape.
* When you want to jerk off, everything goes right out the window.
* Hot wax in your vagina? It's more likely than you think.

== Why Anonymous Fights ==

She wanted to ABORT HER TEENAGE SON because he was viewing pornography. She tells him he's a rapist because he likes girls. She tells him that Jew are responsible for everything wrong in the world. She tells him that he is worthless and inferior. This is unacceptable to me as an Anonymous, it is unacceptable to me as a man, and it is unacceptable to me as a decent human being.

== No lulz About It ==

Biting Beaver, [[Cheryl Lindsey Seelhoff | Cheryl a/k/a Heart]], and the rest of their council of terror are [[batshit insane|totally batshit insane]]. In a strange and unexpected move, Anonymous decided to take up the role of Good, and set out to reclaim Brandon from the toothy maw of his mother's vagina. To date, we are not sure if he succeeded, but we continue to hope and pray to [[Raptor Jesus]] for the lulz that will be had when - not if - Brandon gets told the truth.

Brandon, if you're out there, reading this right now, we just want to let you know: we did it for the lulz.
