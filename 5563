'''MyCrib''' is exactly like [[MySpace]], except with more [[ghetto]] and no [[Tom]]. This makes it much less [[gay]] than MySpace, but there are a lot more [[wigger]]s, [[black]] people, [[gothic|goths]], [[emo]]s, more wiggers, baby [[punk]] rockers, and [[pirate]]s, as if the [[Internet]] didn't have enough God damn pirates. 

MyCrib runs on custom software written by the administrator, who apparently has no life. MyCrib is also taken down [[at least 100]] times a week for "important updates" that either add features nobody uses, or do nothing at all. That being said, it still runs faster and has more uptime than MySpace.

People who use Mycrib probably think they are being cool and alternative by not using the more popular [[MySpace]], but if they were, in fact, cool and alternative than they just wouldn't have even bothered with the fucking Internets anyway.
