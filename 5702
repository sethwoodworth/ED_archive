Nerd Rage/Callout
{{subpage|Nerd Rage}}

'''1) Self righteous [[Waaaambulance|bawwwfags]] [[Moralfags|"moralfags"]] or more correctly: stupid children with no sense of [[lulz|humour]].

'''When the first raid was called against [[Scientology]], we ALL chipped in, one way or another, the [[INTERNET_HATE_MACHINE|Internet Haet Machine]] manned [[Raid|harpoons]] and took down ALL the [[Scientology|CoS sites]].
'''Those who didn't join in, and just kept on going down the rabbit-hole, they found out how disgusting the [[Scientology]] organisation really is. Their discoveries led to the first [[IRL]] protests, and while they (mostly) didn't [[DDOS]], they still cheered the rest on.

'''Now there's a bunch of [[newfags|new recruits]] from other sites, they didn't experience the first days of the action, they didn't feel like they were part of something completely [[epic]] and historic and some decide to shoot down the [[Btards|Channers]].

'''Fuck you, I'm a [[faggot|/b/tard]] and have been for years, [[lurk]] the fuck moar.
'''This movement would never have gone ANYWHERE without the [[retards|Channers]], the [[internet_hate_machine|Internet Hate Machine]] started this movement, they were the first kick, the violent angry birth of [[Chanology]].

'''So, [[Moralfags]] or whatever you're called: Why so serious? Get a sense of humour and respect where you come from, a lot of [[anonymous|End Bosses of the Internet]] [[fap|worked hard]] to get you here.
'''Also, try to have some fucking [[lulz|fun]] at the protests, if I see another one of you reading an [[TL;DR|8 page LJ extract]] or shushing other protesters trying to have fun I'll forcibly penetrate your rectal cavity with a [[Mudkip]] cake.


'''2) [[Basement dwelling]] Internet [[Fail]] Machine antiprotest [[fag|faggots]]:

'''Go on, give yourself a pat on the back, you started something [[xbox]] hueg.
'''But there you go again, as always, the biggest problem with all of us is we buy into this shit so freely, the steaming pile of memeshit that is the [[Internet Hate Machine]] has decided who you are and what you're going to do, just because one person did a fucking [[photoshop]], well done you cockshites.
'''You just lost [[the game]].

'''Ra/[[i]]/dfags are protesting for what's right? BAWWW THEY MAKE US LOOK LIKE [[faggots|GOOD PEOPLE]].
'''Since when has [[Anonymous]] cared about what it looks like or appears to others?
'''That's the FUCKING DEFINITION, no face, no identity, no accountability, final destination.
'''But you're afraid of all those big bad posts calling you a [[pussy]] because you stood up for what you believed in, go eat a bowl of dicks you fucking nonentity.
'''Grow a pair, if you really care so much about how [[Anonymous]] looks then you have been [[troll|trolled]].

'''Also, if you REALLY DO FEEL like the protests are shit, so what? Why the fuck are you trying to do the [[CoS]]' work for them? Go [[troll]] the fuck out of them, go do the shit that [[rape|we won't do]].
'''You won't, because you're pussies and [[Chanology]] is bigger than the few of you that GENUINELY think that the protests should stop.
'''Those who do: Go buy a fucking hot topic T-shirt of JTHM, or are you too rhetorically cool to even do that? Just because [[Chanology]] grew beyond what was easy for you, sitting in the basement running [[Longcat]] flooder, now you think this isn't hardcore enough for you anymore?
'''Of course not, you're just a typical basement dwelling [[faggot]], raging against a nonexistant machine to feel good about yourself. Check your [[unwarranted_self_importance|ego]] at the door.


'''3) Fencesitters:

'''FUCK YOU.
'''YOU'RE THE CANCER KILLING ENTURB, STOP DISCUSSING SHIT AND GET OUT THERE AND START FLYERING.
'''MINIRAID THE FUCK OUT OF THE SCILONS, GO USE [[DIGG]], WHERE ARE ALL OUR FUCKING [[digg|DIGGS]]!?
'''UPVOTE SOME VIDEOS ON [[jewtube|YOUTUBE]], DO SOMETHING YOU LAZY CUNTS.


'''4) [[Old Guard]]:

'''You gave us everything we needed to get to work on this fucking cult, you started it all, you were what got us riled up in the first place, you showed us the way into the rabbit hole, the LMT, Paulette Cooper, [[WBM]], Andreas, [[Magoo]] and everyone else, you all guided us to where we are today, even before you actually aknowledged us.
'''Stop arguing amongst yourselves you [[retarded|fuckwits]], OCMB is a clusterfuck because some of you say DESTROY [[COS]] and the others say GET RID OF [[David Miscarriage|MISCAVIGE]] AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE and the rest say I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS STRESS OSA IS USING MICROWAVE BEAMS ON MY BRAIN.

'''It's all your fucking [[unwarranted self-importance|EGOS]] and [[faggotry|UNWARRANTED SELF-IMPORTANCE]], put them aside and work together, if you did that years ago we wouldn't have so much cleaning up to do today.


'''5) Whiny [[/b/tards]]

'''Go make some original content, make a [[photoshop]] contest, stop [[troll|trolling]] each other because it's [[At_least_100_years_ago|very, very, very old]] now.


'''6) [[420chan|/i/nternet doodle machine]]:

'''[[420chan]]ners, [[Kirtaner|Kirt]] is a [[faggot]] and you're his [[personal army]], well fucking done you drugged up "[[lie|legion]]" of malleable [[retards]].
'''He ruined [[711chan]] and now you get your hollow lulz from trying to fuck with your own /b/rothas? You're completely beyond saving, ask yourself "Is this better than [[troll|trolling]] the fuck out of [[scientology|Scamology]]?"

'''I don't fucking think so.

'''OH, DROP YOUR EGO EVERY FAGGOT THAT THINKS THEY ARE ANY MORE THAN A COG IN THE MACHINE OF ANON, THANKS FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION, STOP TRYING TO HERD CATS, STFU YOU'LL GET GRATITUDE WHEN THE COS IS DONE FOR.'''
