Sock Person
[[File:Sock3.jpg|thumb|280px|A Sock Person]]
A '''Sock Person''' is like a [[sock|Sock Puppet]], but in reverse. Instead of one person having a number of on-line fursonas (Sock Puppets), several people share the one on-line name (a Sock Person). Then most classic example of a Sock Person is [[Anonymous]], a username used by millions of on-line activists. (OK, maybe not ''millions'' of on-line activists but least 23 on-line activists.) The nearest IRL equivalent to a Sock Person is a title, like '[[The Pope]]' or a newspaper column written by a named imaginary person like [[firefly|'Adam Baldwin']].

==The People Behind The Socks==
Most of the people who decide to use Sock usernames are doing it [[i did it for the lulz|for the lulz]]. Take [[Anonymous]] for example. These [[hackers on steroids]] who never forgive or forget are a growing [[cult]] of madness. However, others use Sock Accounts merely for an indication of a [[lemonparty|group]], or to [[buttsecks|honor]] a famous(?) figure, whether it be on the net or [[IRL]]. Unless any of the people who are using the two above reasons to use Sock People have relation to [[Fat Larry's Band]], feel free to troll them with a burning passion.

*Sharing a username entitles you to have [[sex]] with anybody else who shares that name.
*Upon death, [[suicide]], [[an hero|an heroism]], or any other craaaazy life-ending scenario, your username still lives on.
