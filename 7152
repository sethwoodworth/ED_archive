[[SHIT IT OFF]] is the name given to a very recent [[meme]] involving some [[nigra]] police officer and a [[britfag]] in one of [[London|London's]] [[Chanology]] [[raid|raids]].

== How it All Started ==

[[Image:thetrollcannon.jpg|thumb|right|The Trollcannon in question.]]

A bunch of freezefags on [[facebook]] decided it will be [[cool]] to organize a failmob at Liverpool Street Station for May 17th, 2008. A small group of anons in the name of Chanology decided to raid this failmob with anonymous propaganda and whilst in the process a [[black]] cop decided that the raid is now closed and told the anon with the '''TROLLCANNON''' to '''SHIT IT OFF'''.

This was discussed repeatedly on the same day on the Partyvan (now [[AnonNet]] IRC #london channel), in which various britfags thought of turning it into a meme.

First, it was posted.

[IRC LOG WILL GO HERE SOON]

Second, it was posted on /b/

[IRC LOG AGAIN]

And before long it was archived. Someone declared "[[X is now a meme|SHIT IT OFF IS NOW A MEME]]", leading to its archival, and the rest is history.
