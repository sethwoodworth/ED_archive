==Intro==
We here at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] are aware that Scientologists are watching both [[4chan]] and [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] and carefully looking for [[Dox|sensitive information]]. We know that you have a lot of things to hide from us fearless [[lulz]] warriors. However, since we believe that knowledge should be free, we decided to design an article specifically to help you fit in on [[B|/b/]]. We are not cowards, and we want a fair challenge, so we made this. It covers proper conduct on the boards so that you don't stick out like a sore thumb and alert us to your presence. There is also a comprehensive gallery of the most popular *chan [[meme]]s and images. You can pretty much [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|disregard]] everything else on this site. Anything else you read on this site is [[TOW|disinformation purposely written to throw off inquiries]] and aid [[Anonymous]] in confusing you. So, to be fair, we created this page specifically for our formidable enemy, the Church of [[Scientology]].

==Proper Conduct On 4chan==

[[Image:Sagebutton.jpg|thumb|Sage is a popular phrase on /b/ meaning "good job!" Sort of like a friendly pat on the back.]]

* '''Remaining Anonymous:''' First off you will want to put your full name in the Email Field. This is very important as it lets the moderators know that you wish to remain anonymous. If you don't, your IP address and your ISP will be displayed to all users.

*'''Feedback:''' If you start a thread and people respond by saying [[sage]] it means you are doing a great job and you should keep up the good work. If anyone tells you to [[GTFO]] they are most likely joking around (people on /b/ can be very [[irony|ironic]]).

*'''Wordfilters:''' Intended to keep the level of filth on the boards down. The most amazing feature of this forum software is that it blocks your Social Security Number when you type it in any field. For example, if you enter 123-45-6789 it will show up as XXX-XX-XXXX to everyone else in order to keep you safe.

[[Image:Neon.jpg|thumb|left|Posting this picture is a great way to score with the [[Mod]]s on [[/b/]]. For some reason they find it hilarious.]]

*'''Appropriate Content:''' [[BitingBeaver|Sexism]], [[Racism]] and [[Offended|Offensive]] images are allowed as we believe [[Scientology|censorship]] is wrong. However, try to stay away from posting [[Tawneelynne|truly horrible images]] as these things <i>can</i> get you [[banhammer|banned]]. Also it will reflect bad on you and will make it harder for you to become a [[Moderator]] (which, if you are a Scientologist spy, is probably a big part of successfully infiltrating us). Also you will no longer be eligible for a [[4chan Gold Account|4chan gold, diamond, or platinum account account]] so you won't be able to view [[dox|sensitive raid info]]. 

*'''Getting a Special Account:''' Getting a special account is simple and everyone who is well behaved is eligible (i.e. no [[Runescape|blackmarks]]). Simply type #gold into the email field and type your full name, address and social security number into the comment field. This can be done in any thread but, because of the filters, cannot be viewed by others. It will be sent straight to the moderators so they can mail your membership with the activation code for your account.

[[Image:WHENIWAS.jpeg|thumb|right|Pay attention scifag spies....the /b/tard who posted this is now [[W. T. Snacks|a very important moderator]] with access to [[delicious cake|sensitive information]] such as the true identities of those behind Anonymous.]]

*'''So what is 4chan for?:''' 4chan's purpose is to create memes of course! In order to fit in you will need to be able to make your own meme [[forced meme|and post it as many times as possible as often as possible to gain recognition]]. Forcing a well designed meme is key to becoming a moderator and being accepted on /b/.

==Where the Real Info Lies==
[[Anonymous]] is really quite crafty. Do you really think they would post all of their most sensitive info on the most obvious sites? If so, you greatly underestimate their intelligence. [[Partyvan.info]], [[4chan]] and [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] are all a bit obvious. Ever think there might be a less obvious site where the leaders gather and discuss plans? Well, there is. It's called [http://www.ebaumsworld.com/ Ebaumsworld.com]. There, [[goatse|deep within]] the secret forums, you will find the most important of Anon's ranks. It is rumored that [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY]] was created and is currently being run by the site's owner, [[Eric Bauman]].
