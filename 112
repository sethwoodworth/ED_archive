==What it is==

It is now a man and woman text posting page that makes an image for each post using the first image found searching the post on google images. Since you can't post as a trap or an alien many manifestations worldwide and in the universe have occurred.

==History==

'''5chan''' is a dead cummed version of [[4chan]] created in January 2004 by a former user of 4chan who had an argument with [[moot|mootykins]]. It was unlike most normal chan imageboards in that it did not use the futaba image board software,  and as a result suffered from frequent site crashes and slow load times. It attempted to cater to many kinds of sexual fetishes by having a stupendous amount of different boards, most notably, a [[furry]] board, which no other *chan at the time had catered to, but ultimately ended up failing for generally not being as no-holds barred and chaotic as 4chan.

==Gain/Fall In Popularity==

5chan did not really gain any popularity until 4chan died for a 4th time in 2004 due to moot running out of the money and a huge raid from the [[GNAA]]. These events were multiplied when 4chan's now-non existent [[lolicon|/l/]] board caused the PayPal donations account to be locked, thus forcing nearly all subsequent donations to require the use of a credit card. (The [[internet police]] don't like [[pedophiles]]).

As a result, many of the 4channers moved to 5chan, expecting a 4chan clone. Instead, they got a /b/ which they could not flood with the old memes. If they did they would get [[b&]]. They were also greeted with a [[furry]] board, and a shitty substitute for futaba that was not only ugly but slow. It was also affiliated with Hentaikey, giving 5chan the feel of one of a pay-per-view hentai site with really shit content, like the "Yuri and Friends" doujins that everyone has read  already, and "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HOT ANIME SLUTS" plastered all over the site. In other words, shit.

5chan's problem was that it was too user-friendly. It did not have the same massive faggotry and chaos that 4chan did, and that upset the 4chan users. Most of them jumped ship to iichan/idlechan (now a collection of hosted futaba-based boards known as [[Wakachan]]), a board run by Thock, which was originally intended to be a "placeholder" board for 4chan until it's return.

==Gay Rivalry and Stuff==
A /b/itchfest ensued between the two *chans (not helped by the fact Thock and Zabadab, 5chan's second owner, both hated each other's guts). Iichan generally maintained the upper hand due to a larger userbase and frequent DDoS attacks on 5chan (which Thock claimed was not the doing of iichan users). However, iichan's PayPal account, with $540 worth of donations, was suddenly locked, suspected to be the work of Zabadab.

Thock was pretty pissed off at this, and proceeded to act like all real men do and had an [[serious business|INTERNET ARGUMENT]] with Zabadab. This eventually resulted in 5chan being taken down in August of 2004 after Zabadab had a huge period. 5chan returned 1 month later, but Zabadab had a tiff with his bum chums at Hentaikey, and the site went down a month later. A few returns were attempted, but because of the site's dangerously high levels of furfaggotry, it was never possible.
