'''Goths (Gawths, Goffs, Gawff)''' are a [[College|self-aggrandizing]] bunch of attention whores, whose special talent is enjoying attention whilst pretending to disdain it. They especially revel in posturing to incite insult, so that they can say something deep and angsty. The elitist kick they get from this is visible under their pasty pale skin. If under some circumstance the color of something other than skin is in question, assume it's black.

==A Brief History of Goth==

The Goths were [[Germany|Germanic]] tribes who harried the [[Guido|Romans]] in the 3rd and 4th centuries but later [[Jesus|Christianity]] kicked in and they wussed out. In the 5th and 6th centuries, they split up into the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths, then [[pwnt]] [[Mexico|Iberia]] and [[Africa|Italy]], because they wanted to try a little dark meat. That's how "Goth" became a term to describe something that was gaudy and barbaric. During the Middle Ages, gaudy barbaric cathedrals built by the [[French]] were called "Gothic" and by proxy, [[fag|"GAY"]] was added to the meaning of "Goth". The Gothic style emphasized high, open ceilings with large windows set between pillars, creating a bright atmosphere of optimism and reverence during masses, even when the plague was running amok. Compare this with what you have observed of Gothtards in your community.

The first recorded new use of "goths" was from a 1978 magazine article, in which Joy Division's producer commented on the gaudy and barbaric nature of fans, calling them a "horde of goths". Like "Nigger" to blacks and "Master" to whites, some fringe punks shed the embraced their new identity by painting over and redecorating "Gothic" into something that doesn't involve work: reading Romantic and Colonial-era literature, Victorian era clothing, Hair Metal era.. hair, later, sheltering a mindfuck of wildly different music genres that clash with each other as badly as pickles and milk on an empty stomach.

The current batch of "babybats" are a diverse and interesting group, taken as a whole; but taken in small groups they are a clique of narcissistic [[fag|cock humpers]], much like their 1970s fore-bearers.

[[Image:Betty Page.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Betty Page was attractive, healthy, sane and a little kinky, but just for the fun and money. She smiled a lot and tanned well. How she became a gothic role model is not clear.]]

==Types==
Sane individuals regard goths as being a homogeneous group. This is an entirely accurate appraisal, but in the interests of [[Unwarranted Self Importance]] most goths try to makes themselves unique by joining a smaller, more stringent section of the already hyper-conformist non-conformists. Remember, there are no differences beyond the superficial.

*'''Otaku Goth''': An unholy combination that the Goth Luminati invented to give young recruits an isolationist mentality. Prevents them from wanting to expand their circle of friends, so they can't be converted to babyfur when they turn 20.
*'''Betty Page Goths''': They love 1940s pin-up girls. Don't get your hopes up; unlike like Rosie the Riveter, they are not strong, red-blooded American Amazons that make sandwiches and assemble Sherman tanks. Some of the stick-thin to pleasantly-plump ones are pretty fap-worthy, but fail at stimulating retro-porn fetishists.
*'''[[Black Metal]] Goth''': Takes mediocre bands way too seriously. Looks like a regular metalhead with black-light highlights.
*'''Club Goth''': Goths that twingle at dark industrial/electronic style concerts. Many wear white or pastel loli outfits -not ironically- a pair of fuzzy balls on springs on top of their heads and suck pacifiers. When pacifiers are in quantity, the possibility of a furry appearance increases dramatically, leading some to suspect that there is non-cartoon gothic babyfur porn in existence even as this article is posted.(RULE 34 *[http://www.furaffinity.net/view/3719834/])
*'''Cyber Goth''': Otaku goth with glow in the dark hair and a Gothic.Net user account.
*'''Hot Topic Goth''': Has enough money to shop at the mall.
*'''Metal Goth''': Normal people cannot distinguish these from Metalheads and so they are rumoured to be extinct.
*'''Trad Goth''': They read Voltaire and Poe, and listen to Siousxie and the Banshees. They (and your mom) are the only known users of Aqua Net, worshiping Nick Cave as a god, and quoting Alistair Crowley make these guys the [[fags|coolest goths]].
*'''[[Raver]] Goth''': A club goth with large, baggy pants and sometimes suspenders. Some of these wear Cat in the Hat-style hats, to honor their funny hat-wearing French heritage.
*'''[[Bondage|S&M]] Goth''': Attempts to fit into another subculture that is more acceptable to mainstream society. The only visual difference is their pallor.
*'''Trench Coat Goths''': They wear trench coats and listen to metal. Fingerless gloves optional. Due to a certain high-tempered episode of free mass organ ventilation, goths try to distance themselves from them.
*'''Mallgoth''': These are the ones that don't know nothing about goth culture, but tend to go for shock value/look retarded. They are recognized for wearing black eyeshadow to their eyebrows, and black lipstick with little lines at the end. They listen to the [[shit]] music, Marilyn Manson and [[slipknot|slipcock]].To pwn one of them, tell them they're a poser. They will most likely say,"You don't know me in real life im not a poser," or "At least im not a [[My Immortal|prep]] like you!" 
*'''Kindergoth/Babybat''': A very young goth, or an initiate. They are not yet permitted to speak in group settings with older goths, and could get banned from the clique for a week if they so much as go to the bathroom without checking in first.
*'''Hot Goth''': Is sexually mature and will not fuck you, unless you surprise her. They're much easier to surprise when they're whacked out on E, and with all that jailbait running around who'd miss a couple twenty-somethings? [[PROTIP]]: Goths are immune to [[missing white woman syndrome]], because white people are collectively embarrassed by them. The media has caught on and the Jew community has shown rare pity by not holding them up to ridicule on the nightly news.
*'''The Alpha Goth''': Within each [[suburbs|town]] or [[ghetto|city]] there is one of these for each prevalent genre. They are [[attention whores]] and rule the others with their relative desirability.


[[Image:Gothfags.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sex? Not ''MY'' teenage son!]]

==[[Sex]]==

[[Women|A decent amount]] of goths have sex surprisingly often. Goths have a complex series of rituals that they must perform in order to attract a mate. They apply their full regalia and go to a club. At the club, they fill up on weak drinks while sulking in a corner or dancing [[Irony|demurely]]. If she's tolerably hot, she'll get picked up for degrading [[sex]] with a [[jock]] who just wanted to get his hands on some goth ass to show the frat boys that he's slick enough to cross subcultures. He'll invite his buddies over around 3AM, when he can't get it up no matter how much he pisses in her hair, to [[rape|"run a train"]]. After that they'll all take turns scribbling on her with black magic markers and taking pictures to prove to their dad that they aren't [[liar|gay]].

If you ever see a disheveled goth girl walking through a college campus on a Saturday morning with "Phi Alpha Kappa ownz this Ghost-White ASS" written on her leg with a directional arrow expounding on the aforementioned ass, you'll already know the back-story.

If she's a gross goth chick, she's gonna take a [[geek]] home, usually one who just wanted to get his hands on some goth ass to show the other geeks that he's not a geek. She'll make him give her oral sex for a few hours and let him cop a feel under her shirt before kicking him out the door and breaking out the vibrator, or else strapping that vibrator on to give that geek the ride of his life. If he's really done his job bushwhacking, she'll let him be on top. This is [[epic win]] for a geek. He'll blog about it for the rest of his life. 

A male goth will go home empty and take an overweight [[Actor|theatre major]] out for coffee the next day, hoping to get as far as the geek did, in the next couple months. Male goths in high school cannot even manage to pull this off, even if there's a well stocked drama club at hand.

[[Image:Youhavefriendsyoufuckingloserpieceofshit.jpg|thumb|1000px|right|He will spend his entire life in his mother's attic composing great pieces of [[poetry]].]]

==Canon==

Since goths are both seclusive and sectarian, there's really no pinning this down. They can't even get along with normal people well enough to avoid cutting, poetry or drugs. Getting them together long enough to agree on anything is like trying to resolve the [[CoS]] with common sense. Gothic fashion will tend towards a combination of two principles over time:

#Colors that no one else wears exclusively, so that they can have an identity
#Impractical designs

While they don't agree, they'll follow those principles. Fair skin is manpoints to goths, irrespective of genre or gender. In order to mitigate the potential social rejection they so long for, goths create uppity stock phrases to explain their aversion of sunlight. Goths like to tell non-goths that they have no style, and if style means [[AIDS]] then this is true.

PROTIP: Anyone who purposefully uses "wolf" in his name is either a Goth, an [[Injun]] or a [[pedophile]].

[[Image:dd_13.gif|thumb|200px|right|Based on a true story]]

==Diet==

Goths are mustards. They subsist solely on their own feelings of social ostracism. To feed, a goth must try to solicit fear, contempt, or ridicule from [[mundane]]s. This causes an avalanche on thin goths, who are all the more bizarre because they could have a reasonable real life. Some CyberGoths harbor extra feelings of elitism due to pronounced musculature from their supplementary [[Meth]] and strenuous dancing.

==[[Evolution]]==

The gothic subculture has spawned several new genres of epic faggotry that compete to outdo each other. [[Emo]], [[Scene]], [[Actor|Art Theatre]] and ''"The Crow"'' fans stalk the mall and clog independent coffee shops, failing at prodigious rates. These separate identities are easily confused and actually non-existent.

Due primarily to the [[Nazi|German]] goths finally getting bored with mincing about like prats in black lipstick, the European community has been slipping ever more drastically in the direction of [[raver|candy-raving]] manic happy shit. [[Irony]] is defined here, if you missed it in 10th grade. In some sort of attempt to combine wearing bright colors and raving on [[ecstasy]] with the ethos and aesthetic of the gothic movies they still pretend to like, the techno and trance tracks continue to be suspiciously over layed with "sinister" sounding chanting. This is the only noticeble difference between a european goth ecstacy rave and a mainstream ecstasy rave.

The correct answer to any defense or retort is: "Why So Serious?"

==Goth Blocking==
In early 2010, mundanes began to report cases where they were "GOTH BLOCKED." Goths began to troll the entrances to restrooms and such. It has been theorised that this is an attempt of the gothic race to fill the voids in their haunted afterlives.

<CENTER>''Case study of goth blocking.''</CENTER>

===How to Handle Being Goth Blocked===
*Do not panic.
*If threatened, summon your god. (If an atheist, you could consider summoning the [[cops]].)
*Don't worry. After all; they're Goth. Which means they're weak.
*Shove them aside and tell them to, "Get the fuck out of your way." They will stare at you in utter disbelief; but won't say anything, or risk losing the food they're eating.  Which is 24/7.
*If it's a male goth (which is harder to discern than the female Goths) Grab him by his whimpy girl hair and smash his tiny head into the concrete. (Remember; they're Goths. Anyone not a Goth is instantly a Viking in terms of strength compared to these pansies.)

===Ways to to Prevent being Goth Blocked===
*Stay away from places goths frequent, such as cemeteries, the mall, and McDonald's.
*Avoid displaying feelings of dispair, as this is likely to attract the goths.
*Engage in a subculture; only mundanes are goth blocked.
*Do not overuse self-tanner. Orange skin irritates goths.
*Do not worry about getting Goth Blocked, they are scared of any confrontation; Good or bad.  They will walk away.
