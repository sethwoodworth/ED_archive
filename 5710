[[Netflix]] was a service that allowed people to rent an unlimited amount of [[porn]] for a flat rate per month. The problem was that there were [[16 year old girl|16 year old girls]] who used the service for their [[Disney]] [[movie|movies]], and Netflix ditched the porn in favor of [[work safe|family-friendly]] fare.

Their slogan is simple: "We're Not [[Blockbuster]]." This creates rousing cheers from Netflix's loyal customer base, but pisses off Blockbuster's [[Republican]] investors. Since 2007, Netflix has [[win|successfully]] [[pwn|raped the shit]] out of Blockbuster with its success. A large part of this is due to the offering of Netflix on [[gamer|game consoles]] and [[new media]] devices.

[[Last Thursday]], Netflix took over [[Wal-Mart|Wal-Mart's]] [[old media|DVD-by-mail]] distribution system. This upset [[liberals]] who think that Wal-Mart is a [[slavery]] ring designed to take down the [[Communist]] system once and for all.

==Drama-By-Mail==
You'd think an innocent DVD-by-mail scheme would be [[drama]]-free, but there must always be [[fucktard|fucktarded]] types who find some reason to bitch.

In Netflix's case, a small minority of [[insane|tinfoil hat-wearing conspiracy theorists]] believe that Netflix is fucking them [[in the ass]]. When they put a DVD in the mail, they expect Netflix to receive it the next day and ship a new installment of ''Debbie Does [[Dallas, TX|Dallas]]'' the day after. Since the post office couldn't possibly make a mistake or act slowly with the bulk mailings, Netflix must be "[[masturbation|throttling]]" their accounts and not checking in the DVDs when they're received; thus, they only get 40 DVDs a month instead of the  [[OVER 9000|126434]] that are mathematically possible.

Of course, this gross injustice doesn't keep them from cancelling Netflix and starting back up again with a new free two weeks.  Like [[Pirat_ponton]], when logic stares them in the face, they just holler a lot.

If you ever see a postal worker carry in a cart full of mail, these are full of Netflix mailers.

==Game Consoles==
The [[Xbox 360|Three Sixty Box]] and the [[Wii|Wry]] allow you to watch [[Porn|softcore porn]] on your TV via [[Netflix]] and gives [[Boys|kids]] yet another way to get their [[fap]] on.
