[http://enturbulation.org Enturbulation.org] <s>is</s> was an anti-[[Scientology|Co$]] resource and forum that became central to the [[Project Chanology]] cause during the planning of the February 10th protests and other events. The message board is populated heavily by [[Anonymous]] as well as some [[mundanes]] who also oppose Scientology. Enturbulation.org is definitely [[serious business]], however vigilance is a necessary evil when enemies of the lulz are watching.

Enturbulation issues some semblance of press releases[http://forums.enturbulation.org/viewforum.php?f=19] on their message boards. They also have some directions for protests and dealing with [[old media]] on the site. There are some users making an effort to contact their [[the man|local politicians]] and documenting it on the site[http://forums.enturbulation.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2915]. There is also an effort to investigate [[Shawn Lonsdale]]'s death[http://forums.enturbulation.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=4360].
Enturbulation is run by a number of [[Something Awful]] Goons and [[B|Channers]], the founder is [[SA]]'s [[Final Boss]], <s>[[Lowtax]]</s> '''L.E.'''

==[[WTF]] is "Enturbulation"?==
[[Image:Begone.jpg|thumb|right|Straight from the bullshit manual.]]
'''Enturbulation''' is what the [[scilons]] call [[IRL Trolling]], although it isn't really trolling as much as it is [[TLDR]] [[opinion]]. The word means 'agitated' or 'disturbed', which is what happens to the average scifag when [[you|someone]] jams a cherry bomb of factual information into his otherwise-orderly [[hivemind]]. Before [[Anonymous]] awoke from it's steroid-induced slumber deep in the recesses of the internet, Scientology marked enturbulators as "Suppressive Persons", cuing them up for [[crybaby|retaliatory]] [[DDOS|irl DDOS]]. Enturbulation is just one out of many words taken straight from the <strike>[[basement dweller|science fiction]] writings of one [[L._Ron_Hubbard]]</strike> [[lie|English dictionary]].

Enturbulation - [[Scroll up|as stated above]] - is a place for the organization of [[drama|protest]]. The Enturbulators, looking to avoid [[lolsuit]]s, do their best to examine the legality of the protests from place to place. They also look for the most effective sources of info to wield against the scifags. This makes it a must for [[moralfags]] looking to act XD Randum and save the world from evil, while eating delicious [[cock|caek]].

==Why should I care?==
You shouldn't.

==Enturbulation.org in Depth==
Enturbulation.org appeared/gained popularity around the end of January 2008. Enturbulation seems to be sort of a middle ground between [[moralfag|newfags]] and [[anonymous|oldfags]]. Here is some rare ground: [[meme]]-spewing [[newfags]] mixing with triumphant proud [[oldfags]] for a [[Buttsecks|common cause]].

Enturbulation serves less as a spreader of [[lulz]] and more as a collection point for those looking to [[16_year_old_rape_victim_needs_help|rAIDS]] scientology.

If the fraternal relationship between [[Anonymous]] and [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is unknown to you, you need to [[lurk]] more or [[gtfo]] [[newfag]]. [[Srsly]].

==Enturbulation is not Anonymous (BUT...)==

{{squote|1=There seems to be some confusion in regards to the Enturbulation is not Anonymous stance so I thought that I'd write up a post explaining our position on this and hopefully clear up any confusion.

Enturbulation is not [[Anonymous]]. This is the position that was taken from the beginning. Why? Enturbulation was created as a forum to serve a community effort against the Scientology Organization. It's a place where people from all corners of the Internet (from *chan, to SA, to Ebaums, to ARS, to granny flower garden forum) could come to communicate and organize.

There are members of Anonymous who are regular posters on Enturbulation. There are members of Anonymous who are Enturbulation moderators and administrators. On the other hand there are regular posters on Enturbulation that are not Anonymous, as there are admins and mods who are not. Enturbulation.org, as a whole, is not and can not be Anonymous. The very fact that you have to register a username to post on Enturbulation tells me that Enturbulation is not Anonymous.

I'd even go as far as to say that some place as structured and somewhat hierarchical as Enturbulation shouldn't ever be considered Anonymous.

We try to keep things as user run and consensus driven as we can, keeping in the spirit of Anonymous. But at the end of the day we have [[ego|identities]] here. We, as a collective, at Enturbulation, are not Anonymous.

But that's just here, at Enturbulation. Off site we could each, individually be Anonymous. Who knows?|2=[http://forums.enturbulation.org/showthread.php?t=7169 Tuesday]|3=EX-moderator at Enturbulation.org}}

== <s>Enturbulation is Anonymous (kind of)</s> LOL NO THEY AREN'T FAGGOTS! ==
[[Image:Thunderdome01wg6.jpg|right|360px]]

Last Thursday Enturbulation made a [http://forums.enturbulation.org/26-think-tank/bringing-anonymous-enturbulation-5558/?highlight=bringing+anon/ gay thread] suggesting that the concept of Anonymous posting be brought to their forums.  They jumped up and down like Jews at a money market for this idea and one of the pigs set this plan into motion.  What would seem like a really swell idea, seeing as Anonymous started the whole Project Chanology thing, and did a lot of planning out of Enturbulation, turned out to be a shit biscuit of a fuck up when the whole concept of Anonymous posting was ruined by the fact that any mod can keep track of who's posting what.  In essence, all of the Anonymous users, can sit around and play Anon all fucking day, while the SA pig mods can still keep track of who you are, and we all know how awesome Something Awful moderators are.  

tl:dr?

Any idea that you can maintain anonymity by posting on Enturbulation, for a cause created by the internet group Anonymous is a crying shame because their faggot [[mods|nazi]] will always know who you are.  Stick with /i/. Though their [[mods]] may be occasionally reached on [[IRC]]. There was one online Thursday May 15th.

== Copyrights and lack of legal knowledge ==
			
Many of the staff of Enturbulation.org have come recently under the impression that even linking to legally questionable material (a practice which is permitted even on CNN.com) is illegal, and poses a danger to the [[gay niggers|true owners of the site]]. Documents and material which do not even have a remotely questionable legal standing are often removed in favor of being cautious, and those who complain are generally advised to put the materials elsewhere and NOT link to them on Enturbulation -  making [[IRC]] all the more useful as Enturbulation.org is replaced by [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|better websites]] for [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY/LEAKED DOX|this type of stuff]].

==Notable Drama: Enturbulation Enturbulated==

On the evening of May 20th, 2008, all hell broke loose on [[Enturb]] as [[mod]] turned on mod, mods quit, users quit and there were [[dicks everywhere|banhammers everywhere]].

===[[brb, soup|Ramengate]]===

[[Image:Basedonatruestory2.PNG|800px|thumb|center]]

'''And All For The Want Of A Cup Ramen, A Kingdom Was Lost'''

It all started when '''[[Lowtax|LE]]''' got [[fat|hungry]] and Jew for some [[profit|user donations]] so he could sate his insatiable appetite for [[Ramen]]. When '''[[Homeless|Tuesday]]''' called him on it, [[Lowtax|LE]] went [[David Miscarriage]] on her and he [[rape|enturbulated]] her with the [[banhammer]].
Eventually '''[[Lowtax|LE]]''' suffered from [[rape|rapists]] remorse and decided to let '''Tuesday''' back in the [[Internet|playground]].  Later, [[Lowtax|LE]] would retract his [[aspie|horrible shitty behavior]] and pretend like he actually [[lie|paid back the money]] and that [[bullshit|nothing of value was ever lost]] and would unban '''Tuesday''' (who is still a fat annoying cunt) and tamphex would come back to the site.  

Systemically however, members of the crew responsible for bringing this shitty nightmare of a llama to light would get ddosed off the Internet while browsing Enturbulation ([[User:Weedbag|WB]],[[711chan|tycho, andy]] and [[dr3k]]) from [[IP address|IP addresses]] at the business where [[Lowtax|LE]] and [[ITT Tech|Poppins]] works (cari.net).  When questioned about it, [[ITT Tech|Poppins]] simply replied that it was a HUGE coincidence that [[ITT Tech|www.cari.net]] and [[ITT Tech|mail.cari.net]] were involved [[Computer Science III|ddosing]] those people and that he would contact the NOC.  The NOC would later tell him it [[lie|wasn't happening]] and that he should go back to answering phones and being fat and so he believed it because they're people like him too.  In all, [[And nothing of value was lost|nothing was lost]] except everyone's respect for [[Lowtax|LE]], [[ITT Tech|Poppins]] and a shitload of posts by dr3k which were of marginal usefulness sometimes.  The End .....

<br>

== dr3k's shit deleted ==

While [[dr3k]] can be a total [[newfag]], [[furry]] and possibly even a [[spy]] a lot of things that were posted on his account were very useful.  On May 10th 2008, the administrator on the site known as [[IT Tech|Poppins]] decided that banning and shunning [[dr3k]] on the forums was simply not enough so he went into the [[buttsecks|back-end]] while severely [[drunk]] and [[Delete fucking everything|deleted every post]], thread and mention of [[dr3k]]'s name on the forums.  This caused [[lollercoaster|A LOT OF LULZ]].

== Thunderdome <s>Locked</s> Unlocked ==
<s>As of /6/21/08 the [[Thunderdome]] has been locked, with Nazi mods citing too much drama. [[It is widely considered|Some Argue]] that LE was bribed by a [[Scientologist|Scientology]] to lock the Thunderdome. The situation is still developing and is creating lots of [[drama]] and [[rage]] from the community. Stay tuned for more asshatery.</s>

Wait, whats this folk? The [[Thunderdome]] has been unlocked but Gunslinger (a filthy Jew mod) has hinted that it might not last...[[fact|Not that it matters because no one likes him anyway]]. LE probably doesn't know yet, but odds are good that he will shit masonry upon seeing the dome back up. Poppins meanwhile, has regained vast amounts of credit for unlocking the dome.

== 11/29/08 The Day Enturb Stood Still ==
One day enturbulators attempted to login only to find that they were trying to connect to a server that was no longer there.  The reason? LE had sold the server for a ticket to LExico so he could buy ramen, hookers and blow (in exactly that order). In truth only LE and Poppins know exactly what went down. Supposedly LE feared a physical theft of the server by [[Poop]]ins so he took it offline and ran off along with all of the donations. To this date he has never made an attempt to restore any of these items thus proving that you should never evar give your money to a Jew.

After the inevitable implosion of [[Africa|Enturbulation]] and LE's disappearance other networks were setup or adapted to suit the needs of the [[Anonymous]] that constantly shit up the dome. After a brief time [[moralfag|Gregg]] and [[trap|Poppins]] got married and Enturbulation's database was migrated over to [[marblecake|WhyWeProtest]] along with the original Thunderdome. Sadly, many of the users who once brought life to that hell hole have moved on or simply don't give a shit about [[Project Chanology]] anymore. This has led to WhyWeProtest turning into a hive of faggotry and pointless OCMB moonbattery.
