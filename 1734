[[File:ConnerIRL.jpg|thumb|right|And Conner in [[IRL|practice]].]]
'''Conner Lupindo Hemming''' ([[Powerword|Zachary Scott White]]) is an asspie furfag whose tantrums have led him to make some rather unfortunate decisions in his life. Between plugging his shitty band or in the midst of a vendetta against any of his numerous former internet flings, Conner got the idea that [[X is not your personal army|he could entice Encyclopedia Dramatica to attack his enemies for him]] due to his crippling incompetency.

__TOC__

==How It All Began==

It all started, as it so often does, on a humble little website known as [[DeviantArt]]. Conner started out his ban evading when he got banned from chatrooms on dAmn, Deviantart's social network. From there it went to Secondlife, where he roomed with a few "friends", and threw a hissy fit when one of them left a cock waffle, a prim penis with a waffle texture on it, in his room. He later claimed that setting eyes upon that cockwaffle actually turned him into the cock-loving [[faggot]] he is today.

[[image:Cockwaffle.jpg|thumb|DON'T LOOK AT IT, IT WILL TURN YOU GAY!!!]]

===Conner the Crybaby===
[[File:ConnerSmash1.jpg|thumb|right|"TAKE THAT, WORLD!" *fapfapfapfap*]]

Conner is, like every other [[furfag]], an angry little man who often uses his demented [[fetish|fetishes]] as an escape from the terrible world that would persecute him. Specifically, Conner has him a thing for [[macrophile|giants and feet]]. He did what [[all|most]] furries do in his situation, and delved headfirst into the world of furrydom, relishing all the amoral ejaculation fodder that encompassed it. Also like most furries, Conner used this to vehemently deny his humanity and oppose the hyumons and their customs. And yet again, as furries do, Conner surrounded himself with [[buttbuddies|kindred spirits]] that shared his contempt for the world. Being a pathological liar with a healthy case of paranoia merely added to the festivities.

Life was good for Conner, [[faggot|cyberfucking]] his way through teen boys like a machine and writing [[livejournal|his deep compositions]] to be expressed via his one other love; [[theft|music]]. But a [[lulz|funny thing]] happens when an anti-social asspie with a vendetta against society surrounds himself with nothing other then anti-social asspies with vendettas against society. You see, every time Conner and a fuckbuddy decided to part, war was declared. Not content with merely cutting said fag out of his life and moving on as any other would, Conner took lessons in the [[Wolfeedarkfang|Wolfee Darkfang]] School of Scorn and concluded that if he couldn't have that [[cock]], then he would have to drive said cock completely off the internet with his batshit theatrics. But again, Conner ''is'' a furry, and furry break-up dramas are commonplace. 

Conner, however, did what many furries threaten, but very few have the [[USI|bravado]] to do.

==Conner Kicks It Up a Notch==

[[File:ConnerHatesAqua.png|thumb|right|Conner goes two-for-two.]]

For years, Encyclopedia Dramatica has been the scourge of many a furfag. Furry sites far and wide brim with deviants living in fear that they too will join the [[Anal|annals]] of lulz and forever have their would-be [[e-fame|furry fame]] tainted by having their publicly posted, easily searchable secrets compiled into one easy-to-use display of mockery. Indeed, the [[hilarious|dreaded]] Dramatica article is seen by many furries as the nuclear option. Mutually assured destruction; if one goes down, he'll most certainly take his foe with him. 

Of course, [[impossible|''not'' being a total retard and using a name that couldn't be immediately traced back could negate that entirely]]. Conner, [[awesome|regretfully]], didn't think that far ahead before plunging right into things.

==="lawl Draconas [[Lame|i get u banned]] XD"===
It was time for Conner's seasonal break-up feud, and he had decided to spice things up this go-round and take an initiative to have his ex [[b&|shitcanned]] from Fur Affinity. Unsurprisingly, this caused his ex to become quite [[nerd rage|infuriated]] at the perceived miscarriage of [[cyber police|internet justice]], and sent him on a warpath of [[butthurt|indignation]] across the rest of the internet. Had Conner merely been content with fucking up furfaggotry for his victim, he could have quite easily chalked it up as a [[win]] and bragged to all his future fuckbuddies about that time he liek ttyl troll'd that guy awhile back. He instead decided to up that ante and Dramatica that bitch, determined to claim [[epic win]] over his foe.

===Dramatica, [[Stupid|ATTACK!]]===
[[File:ConnerMakingItWorse.png|thumb|right|Conner oblivious to the fact that making it seem like he's involving '''real life family members''' makes him look like an even bigger retard.]]
Conner had banished his ex from Fur Affinity and, as he saw it, trolled him quite well. Draconas had now threatened him with death and had made quite the scene on [[YouTube]] and [[DeviantArt]] over the incident. Less awesome for Conner, however, was that nobody else seemed to care, even though he maintained he had just pulled off some [[Fail|epic shit]] and everybody else just didn't realize the scope of it all yet. Oh, but they would! Conner, himself not unknown to Dramaticans, began compiling his own wishlist against Draconas and all the [[Unfunny|laughs]] he had gotten from his jilted ex, most of which were [[Divide by zero|allegedly because of his white knighting of Conner himself]]. That it [[Shit nobody cares about|wasn't actually that amusing to anyone but him]] be damned, Draconas '''would''' be on Encyclopedia Dramatica. And hell, while he was at it, he may as well [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|remove some of the more "unnecessary" aspects from his own section]]. He was bringing in them lulz like a champ, he [[Lie|figured]], and Dramatica owed him that much at least. And of course, he may have had one or two other jilted lovers in mind, so his disapproval alone justified pages as well!

And what the hell, since he's in the neighborhood anyway, why not plug his [[band]]? Four birds with one stone!

Unfortunately, Conner's weak offering wasn't enough for an article's worth of humiliation for Draconas or any other of his boring ex cyberfuck friends, much less a free pass to pointless [[edit war]]s and page blanking, despite his insistence of the contrary.

===Conner Gets Pissed Off and Just Does it Himself===

Fed up with the lack of cooperation and angry that his [[personal army]] faggotry had led himself to being documented on Encyclopedia Dramatica, Conner took it upon himself to write the entire thing single handedly. The results, a sloppily assembled vanity page about him totally trolling his ex, was [[Shit|less than commendable]]. Worth noting, however, is his repeated mentioning of himself ([[Crazy|in the third person]]) as a faggot and how most of Draconas' problems were because of [[white knight]]ing said faggot.

===Consequences===
[[Image:Connerjournal.png|thumb|right|A manchild getting his internet taken away.]]
[[Image:Connerlying.png|thumb|right|HAHA, jokes on [[you]]!]]
Shortly after Conner wrote the [[Draconas Rayne]] article, this article was read by an enterprising [[troll|lulzmonger]] of the [[Patriotic Nigras]].  Said nigra instantly recognized Conner's name from earlier trollings of [[MrDisambiguation]]'s personal [[gay|tolerance]] gestapo, the "New*Furry*Military".  Upon discovering that he already had Conner's [[dox]], the troll went and posted them on Draconas' YouTube page.  This of course, led not only to Conner putting up a shield of lies on the troll's channel, but indignant furries crying on Draconas' [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/draconas Furaffinity page].
<br>
<br>


====Qutting Forever====
Conner has recently announced that [[Lol|his internet is being "cancelled" by his mother]].  Permanently.  Interestingly enough, this has <b>nothing</b> to do with his dox being dropped.  Nope.  Totally a coincidence.  Also puzzling to us, is how Conner lives with his [[dog|mate]] in New York, yet his mom still has control over his internet.  Clearly, this is a [[Ickeriss69|complex and elaborate]] setup, designed to fool the trolls.  Knowing Conner and his past actions, he's just too [[Retarded|smart]] to leave his personal information lying around.

To commemorate the occasion, he posted the best of his [[Sick fuck|dog vore]] collection.

==The Deadly Wolves==
[[File:ConnerBand2.png|thumb|right|"Please take our free music? C'moooooooooon..."]]
[[File:Werewolves Vs Vampires Cover by ShadowConner.jpg|thumb|right|Death metal's for pussies.]]
Indeed, it became more and more obvious that Conner's insistence of Draconas' humiliation stemmed not only from a desire to destroy his ex, but to plug his faggy ass music. [[Furry|The Deadly Wolves]] seemed to be not only [[Ickeriss69|epic trolls]] but musical savants as well. What better place to spread the word than to ED itself after they released such a [[fail|smackdown]] of epic proportions upon thier foes?

And exposure they needed, since The Deadly Wolves '''literally''' [[Loser|couldn't even give their music away]].

A spiteful attempt at revenge? Publicity stunt gone awry? The world may never know.

==Conner [[Fails|Attempts]] PsyOps==
[[File:ConnerPersonalArmy1.png|thumb|right|"HAHA I'm not using a lot of sock puppets to hide my ass [[Vandalism is pointless|QUICK GO REGISTER AND VANDALIZE THE PAGE!!!]]]]
Fortunately for us all, Conner's [[Pathetic|"Mommy's taking away my internet!"]] excuse was just a [[desperate|clever]] ploy on his part to try and shake his newfound infamy. Figuring that people believing a 20 year old man had his internet access completely controlled by his mum was the less embarrassing cover, Conner used the diversion and began registering to Encyclopedia Dramatica [[Dumbass|yet again]], only this time instead of trying his hardest to cobble together a [[Shit|decent page]] for Draconas, Conner surmised that he could [[trying too hard|pretend to be several 'close' acquaintances]] of Conner who wanted only for his page to be as accurate as possible. First on the agenda for these [[Sockpuppets|fresh faces]] would be to [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS| correct all those unfortunate mistakes]] all the previous trolls had confused for legit info; dox, messenger handles, Youtube channels, that sort of thing.

[[Nice try|Somehow]], fellow ED editors began to get suspicious: not all was right with these [[noobs|newbies]]. A common theme was shared amongst them, in particular a [[Newfag|strange lack of understanding of memes and chanspeak]], an inherent desire to pull [[Powerword|specific information]] from the page, and the [[butthurt|less than courteous response]] to senior contributors asking them politely to [[GTFO|cease their repeated, detrimental adds]]. However obvious it was from the start that Conner was [[Forever Alone|merely pretending to be his own friends the entire time]], desperation and frustration deluded his attempts from "Poorly Veiled" to "Not Even Trying". Among these desperation efforts, a few stood out.

===The Mysterious Case of the Million MacroFurrys===

One of the lazier attempts at deception, Conner registered to Encyclopedia Dramatica under his YouTube famous Macrofurry handle. Inserting himself into a discussion, appropriately about a recent video that had been posted- and then deleted- on said channel (in which Conner had announced he was returning from the internet exile he was forced into due to trolls, because he had since discovered that [[Haters Make Me Famous|haters had indeed made him famous]]), Macrofurry attempted to persuade the crowd that Conner wasn't really ''THE'' Macrofurry, but merely a contributor to a channel with several users that operated the channel daily. In fact, Macrofurry declared, Conner [[Lie|'''wasn't even really into macrophilia that much'''!]].

There were just [[Over 9000|one or two]] things wrong with Macro's version of events. 

Namely;
* Conner, on his [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=ConnerHemming ConnerHemming Youtube profile], specifically links to MacroFurry, informing people that is where he will post macro fetish fodder.
* Conner favorites macro fetish art '''constantly'''.
* Announced "leaving" the MacroFurry account due to the Conner Hemming article on Encyclopedia Dramatica.
* Returned to the MacroFurry account insisting that the '''Conner Hemming''' page only served to provide more views for the '''Macrofurry''' account.
* At no point previously was there any indication that Macrofurry on YouTube had been more than a single user.


When confronted with this overwhelming wall of evidence contrary to his claims, Conner's autistic fury kicked in, and he proceeded to retaliate with a defense that rivaled [[OJ Simpson|"If it don't fit you must acquit"]]; that the trolls, by linking Conner Hemming with Macrofurry and taunting him with sarcastic comments, therefore must believe '''every''' furfag into macrophilia must be Conner!

Conner then decided he would waste every hour he spent trying to convince Encyclopedia Dramatica that he wasn't a macrophile that used sockpuppets to defend himself, and [[Facepalm|went onto a macrophile forum and proceeded to show them what those dumb ol trolls had said not an hour after they had said it]], begging them that, hey, since they were in the neighborhood, they might as well [[Personal army|register and help him vandalize the page]]. Proving to us all that he fails at the basic process of learning from his past mistakes.

To be continued.

==Battle of the Butt Burglars==
In a fine example of [[Anger|stubbornness]], Conner fought the [[Lulz|good fight]], confident that like the [[Wolfeedarkfang|Wolfee Darkfang]]s and [[TheWetRabbit|Wet Rabbits]] before him, flinging himself headfirst into drama at every given opportunity would [[Never|eventually]] pay off. And demonstrating that classic Conner Hemming judgment that got him this far, Conner decided he would take infamous crybaby and sick fuck extraordinaire [[Cid Silverwing]] as his new battle ally and bff. Remember that whole thing we said earlier about "Surrounding himself with people as crazy as himself"? Conner took this shit to whole new levels here. 

{{main|Cid_Silverwing#The_Two-Man_Power_Trip}}

===Conner May Just Be The Biggest Retard Ever===
[[File:CidMadAtConner.png|thumb|right|Cid Silverwing: Somehow an even bigger idiot than Conner]]

Frustrated and depressed that his new love, like everyone else, was sick of seeing him around, Conner decided to come up with a way to strike back at his once-beloved gimp. In doing so, he came up with the most [[Retarded|outlandish]], [[Facepalm|unbelievable]] response  to anything ever and, had it not have been Cid Silverwing he was talking to, would have immediately been mocked and exiled has he had been hundreds of times before. Luck smiled upon Conner today however.

That's right. Conner Hemming, in an attempt to make somebody, '''anybody''' believe he wasn't a total loser that even the [[Basement dweller|bottom rung]] of a [[Furry|fringe element]] of [[Loser|losers]] wanted nothing to do with him, told Cid Silverwing that he wrote his own Encyclopedia Dramatica article himself. For attention. Which he got. And then [[Nice try|only pretended]] to be trolled, ridiculed over it, and attempt to [[Vandalize|blank]] several times to throw people off the trail. That the entire ordeal was [[Ickeriss69|a rather large, elaborate, and complex troll]] he had planned from the very beginning, all in the name of tricking Cid into having cybersex with him so he could hand over logs to the trolls and have them added onto the Encyclopedia Dramatica page.

It's unknown exactly why Conner thought saving logs of himself initiating sex with, passionately declaring love for, and confiding suicidal thoughts (over a page full of screencaps and logs of shit he admitted to having done, no less) to Cid Silverwing all in the name of obtaining boring, uninteresting sex logs filled with nasty furry bullshit would ever end up making him look good, or even the lesser of two freaks, but we at Encyclopedia Dramatica are sure glad he did.

'''Update''': He now denies he ever admitted to making his own article, opting now to insist he was a super secret triple agent, pretending to troll Cid but really trying to find super secret evidence about who actually wrote the articles! Until the next time he and Cid get into a lovers quarrel. Then he'll probably be super ween troll again.

==Draconas Rayne Vs. Conner Hemming: They're doing it wrong==
[[File:DraconasLovesConnerAgain.png|thumb|right|"Guys, stop Conners trolls! What? No, [[Lie|I have no idea why they're trolling him]], JUST MAKE THEM STAWP!]]
So very wrong. As a quick glance at their respective blogs, Deviant Arts and whatever Fur Affinity accounts they manage to sneak past moderation will reveal, Conner Hemming and Draconas have, figuratively and literally, [[Fag|kissed and made up]]. Draconas can now be seen, [[Repetition|once again]], vigorously defending Conner from the new swarms of trolling this article has earned him.

Yes, the weeks long blood feud essentially now pointless, Conner and Draconas will surely be too busy defending each others cyber honor and [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/8/87/DraconasTrollspy.png furry dignity] from the trolls each worked so hard to provoke for the other. It should be at this point that two people would realize their problems were entirely of their own making; that, by using rationalization and a healthy dose of maturity, these problems could have been avoided entirely and that many new problems may be skipped in the future. [[Awesome|Thankfully]], Conner and Draconas are [[Fact|gigantic furry faggots]] who know the ''real'' solution is to get a furry mob together and STOPCONNERSTROLLS!

==Conner Fun Facts==

* By his own account, Conner's epic trolling of his ex's began after [[Conner Hemming/story|being laughed at for being an emo faggot]].

* Despite bragging for busting people for ban evasion, Conner is so obessed with furry porn that he's made [[at least 100|at least 50]] sockpuppets to repeatedly sign up to [[furaffinity|Fur Affinity]], Second Life, and [[DeviantArt|Deviant Art]]. And because [[All|most of]] said accounts consist of the words 'Conner', 'Hemming', 'Cobalt', or 'The Last Werewolf' (sometimes even with 'Shadow' as a prefix), in some way, these accounts are instantly found and rebanned. This pretty much proves that he's as transparent as glass when it comes to [[lying|straying from the truth]] and ban-evading. It's really hard to take him seriousley at first glance because of this.

* Conner was told he could skirt ban evasion rules due to a [[In the ass|special understanding]] he had with [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/FurAffinity#ChaseVRocket ChaseVRocket], who assured him his blatantly obvious accounts would be safe. Conner, for once, did not listen and reported the said admin to Dragoneer.

* Conner once commissioned a fullbody fursuit from [[Jesskitt]] for well over $1,000, which [[Shit|fell apart]] less than a year later. This resulted in [http://community.livejournal.com/fursuit/3586804.html delicious drama], however not enough to prevent Conner from proudly wearing said terribly made suit around the house posing for pictures.

* Conner is incredibly fond of showing off his Encyclopedia Dramatica article to what he believes are friends, encouraging them to spam the page in his honor. [[Forever Alone|It '''never''' works and he usually just registers another sockpuppet to do it himself]].

* In between band practice and bouts of drama, Conner enjoys a good [http://forums.macrophile.com/viewtopic.php?t=13429&highlight= macro foot fetish roleplay] from time to time.

* A quick inspection of any screencaps he's made reveals that he has notorious furry [[pr0n]] site, [[e621]], bookmarked.

* If you have a half hour to kill, you can [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/3708750/ send Conner into a pretty entertaining] schizophrenic episode.
