Scott Stapp of [[Creed]] follows [[Jesus]] to Denny's on July 29th, 2005. 

<hr>

Scott Stapp, lead singer of the pseudo-Christian torture factory Creed, provides an object lesson in how to fuck your C-level celebrityhood beyond all recognition.

Short Story: Scott Stapp gets thrown off of a plane for being a drunk fuck, hits on some skeeze at the airport bar, and then has his filthy [[girlvinyl|skank]] sister drive him all over Florida searching for his mystery cooze.

[http://www.livejournal.com/users/tomluv/13923.html This amazing journey] takes them to a Gainesville, Florida Denny's, whereupon he is viciously mocked by his adoring fans.

The story becomes incandescent with delicious detail at this point.  The Lexapro, the coke-fueled pussy hunt, getting robbed by an LJ troll, and having his girlfriend's receipts for boob jobs stolen. 

There's so much more. With pictures. [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ohnotheydidnt/2990262.html Just read on.]

From one person's LJ to {{ljcomm|ohnotheydidnt}} [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ohnotheydidnt/2984702.html (1)] [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ohnotheydidnt/2990262.html (2)] [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ohnotheydidnt/2990845.html (3)] to [http://defamer.com/hollywood/celeb-sex-tapes/scott-stapp-accuses-sex-tape-of-killing-his-already-dead-career-157787.php Defamer], all the way to your eager eyes.  Enjoy.
