Sgt. Marcia Ramode
<br>
'''Sgt. Marcia Ramode''', email = marcia.ramode@usarec.army.mil, was an [[army]] recruiter who corresponded with recruits by [[email]]. Between February 27 and March 1, 2007, she got [[pwned]] by a [[GNAA|gay nigger]] in an email conversation that deserves to go in the [[trolling]] [[Legendary ruin status|hall of fame]], and lost her job for looking like a complete jackass.

==The Scoop==

Ramode lurked the careerbuilder site looking for poor, young, impressionable [[retards]], much like all recruiters do. She came across Corey Andrew. Little did she know that he was a [[gay]] black person. After Andrew admitted his [[faggotry]], Ramode proceeded to respond to him in an incredibly [[racist]] and [[homophobic]] manner, using [[ALL CAPS]] and bad [[grammar]], proving that [[Not Gay|Don't Ask, Don't Tell]] is a stupid policy. The [[win]] was most epic because '''she used her military email address to send all the emails''', meaning the entire time she was representing the military and proving that Army = homophobes (though gays are still wanted in the Navy).

==The Emails (Warning, [[tl;dr]])==

:'''Sgt. Ramode:''' My name is Marcia Ramode, and I am United States Army recruiter. I saw your resume on career builder and we have lots of vacant positions in Logistics, Administration...If interested please give me a call at my toll free number.

:'''Andrew:''' Awesome! Sounds great! The US Military has so many vacant positions and opportunities. I had no idea. I'm seriously considering contacting you. One thing, I'm not up on current politics but since its 2007, I would imagine also that I am now able to serve in the US military as an openly gay man, right?

:'''Ramode:''' WELL I FYOU ARE GAY WE DON'T TAKE YOU. YOU ARE CONSIDERED UNQUALIFIED.

:'''Andrew:''' Wow! Unqualified to serve my country just because I'm gay? It's because they think I might all of a sudden desire one last kiss from my fellow male solider if ever facing death at the hands of the enemy in a fox hole, isn't? Yup, that's it.
:Funny, the US Government doesn't mind taking my "gay" dollars every tax season or out of my paycheck every two weeks. I'm stunned that the US ARMY could afford to be so choosey when I see sergeants on my school campus and in the local shopping Mall like pedofilic predators everyday begging teenagers to enlist. Then if I factor in the 10 solicitations I've gotten in just one day through CareerBuilder.com in which even YOU clearly stated the ABUNDANCE of vacancies and positions waiting to be filled in the Army, I would say the US military's recruitment tactics are self defeating wouldn't you? By the looks of it, especially with Iraq, looks like you kids could use all the help you can get. By the way, you might want to avoid emailing in all caps, because it represents shouting and hostility, unless of course, in this case, as I suspect, you are homophobic. Then it's all relative.

:'''Ramode:''' YOU ARE DEFINITELY UNQUALIFIED, NOW TAKE YOU GAY SELF SOMEPLACE ELSE WE DO NOT TOLERATE GAY PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN ANY PART OF THE MILITARY. AND IF IT BOTHERS YOU PAYING TAXES THEN MIGRATE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. AND IF IT BOTHERS YOU ABOUT THE US MILITARY RECRUITING THEN YOU GO TELL THE BOARD OF EDUCATION THAT THEY NEED TO STOP THE FUNDS THE GOVERNMENT GIVES THEM FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL EVERY YEAR. TAKE ALL THESE INTO CONSIDERATION AND MOVE ON OR MOVE OUT OF THE UNITED STATES.
:YOU ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO SERVE IN THIS COUNTRY ALL BECAUSE YOU ARE GAY AND IF YOU DO NOT LIKE ME WRITING IN CAPS THEN DELETE MY EMAILS AND DO NOT RESPOND I THINK IT SCARED YOU TO DEATH. YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY SAY THANK YOU TO THE US ARMY FOR PAYING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY MONTH SO THAT YOU CAN POST YOUR RESUME FOR FREE ON CAREER BUILDER AND FURTHERMORE IF YOU DONT LIKE GETTING ANY EMAILS FOR THE US ARMY RECRUITING THEN TAKE YOUR RESUME OFF CAREER BUILDER BECAUSE WE PAY FOR YOUR FREE SPACE THERE. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE RECRUITERS RECRUITING IN FRONT YOU HIGH SCHOOL THEN COMPLAIN TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR BETTER YET TRY COMPLAINING TO MAYOR BLOOMBERG AND SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.
:FURTHERMORE WE ARE NOT DESPERATE AS YOU MAY THINK SINCE IF WE WERE DESPERATE WE COULD GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET AND SEND THEN STRAIGHT TO IRAQ OR BRING BACK THE DRAFT LIKE IN THE DAYS OF THE WW11 AND VIETNAM. THOUSANDS OF QUALIFIED PEOPLE JOIN THE ARMY EVERY DAY.
:YOU SHOULD SAY THANK YOU MILITARY PEOPLE FOR WHAT YOU DO SO THAT YOU CAN LIVE A FREE LIFE IN THIS COUNTRY. FREEDOM IS NOT FREE. THE US MILITARY GIVES YOU THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH SO THAT YOU CAN SEND EMAILS LIKE THIS ONE TO US. SO ENJOY YOUR FREEDOM WHILE YOU CAN BECAUSE WHEN YOU MOVE ON TO ANOTHER COUNTRY YOU WOULD NOT BE BALE TO SEND EMAIL LIKE THAT THEY WOULD PUT YOU IN JAIL.
:ENJOY THAT FREEDON SINCE WE FIGHT FOR YOUR FREEDOM EVERY DAY. ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS.
:GOOD LUCK TO YOU MY GAY FRIEND AND BEST WISHES AND HAVE A NICE DAY.
:DONT FORGET WHEN YOU SEE THE NEXT SOLDIER BE KIND SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT FREEDOM YOU SO ENJOY EVERY DAY AND ALSO SAY THANK YOU SO THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO POST YOUR RESUME FOR FREE ON CAREER BUILDER.

:'''Andrew:''' Before you go on waving your flag all over the place let me first inform you, that as an African American who's ancestry is most likely MORE deeply rooted in American history than yours ever will be...I respect the millions of soldiers fighting to protect my rights every day but just so you know, those rights include me being gay... I applaud servicemen and women everyday for their role in our country's protection. However, for you and the government to deem homosexuals "unqualified" to risk their own lives and defend their own freedom as well as their country's freedom, is moronic.

:'''Ramode:''' OH I FORGOT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YES YOU MIGHT TO TRY TO KISS A SOLDIER IN THE FOXHOLE SO THAT IS A NO NO.

:'''Andrew:''' You are living proof that "Don't Ask Don't tell" is a fallacy. You initially rejected me without any consideration whatsoever of my integrity, or abilities. This behavior is at the very core of the discrimination that has plagued the USA for decades. You should know that I never had any intention of joining the military; I simply wanted to have this discussion to prove a point. With over 2,500 cases of anti-gay harassment acts against gay soldiers, including bashings and murders, for you to say the US Military only takes "straights" is delusional.

:'''Ramode:''' YOU HEAD OF FTO THE GAY LAND OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO MORALS AND GET RID OF YOURSELF. PERSONALLY I THINK BEING GAY IS DISGUSTING AND IMMORAL. AND ANOTHET THING AS AN AFRICAN HAVE NO PLACE TO SAY YOUR ROOTS ARE DEEPLY ROOTED HERE. MY ROOTS ARE MUCH STRONGER THAN YOURS. YOU WERE BROUGHT HERE BEING YOUR WILL POWER WHEREAS MY ROOTS RUN FROM THE NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN. I HAVE MORE RIGHTS HERE THAN YOU AND MY ROOTS HAVE BEEN HERE EVER SINCE BEFORE THE AMERICAS WERE DISCOVERED.
:YOU TAKE YOUR GAY ASS OFF SOMEPLACE AND GO TO SOME OTHER COUNTRY AND BADMOUTH THE MILITARY.
:FREEDOM ISNT FREE YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH WAS GIVENM TO YOU BY THE US MILITARY.
:AND ANOTHER THING YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF DONT ASK DONT TELL TAKE YOUR ASS BACK WHERE YOU BELONG NOT HERE. IF YOU ARE GAY YOUR ASS IS OUT THE MILITARY. GET FUTHER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IT AND THEN TRY TO ARGUE YOUR CASE
:BYE
:TAKE YOUR ASS BACK WHERE YOU BELONG NOT HERE.

:'''Andrew:''' Clearly with your limited vocabulary and poor spelling, the Army mayhave been the only option YOU had in life. Granted, there are highly intellectual people in the military. You're just not one of them. You've proven that in your poorly executed efforts to state your case against homosexuals in the military and in your naive stupidity in believing that gays are not there to begin with. I'll tell you what's "disgusting" - Idiots with big mouths and little brains, spewing hatred under the guise of being "American." I would advise you to look up your Native American history you are so proud of and research their position on homosexuality. They are very tolerant and accepting of homosexuals believing that the inner spirit is true to itself in its nature. They are less tolerant of fools than they are of homosexuals. So take that to your next rain dance and STFU!

:'''Ramode:''' YOU GO BACK TO AFRICA AND DO YOUR GAY VOODOO LIMBO TANGO AND WANGO DANCE AND JUMP AROUND AND PRANCE AND RUN ALL OVER THE PLACE HALF NAKED THERE AND PRACTICE YOUR GAY MORALS OVER THERE THAT'S WHERE YOU BELONG....I AM REPORTING YOU AS SPAM AND ADDING YOU TO MY BLOCK SENDER LIST SO I DO NOT HAVE TO HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN.
:YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR SPELLING SO ARE THE ONE WHO SO ILLITERATE. OBVIOUSLY YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND IF YOU ARE GAY YOU ARE OUT OF THE MILITARY YOU ARE DISQUALIFIED. SO WHATS THE BIG ISSUE HERE. YOU ARE UPSET YOU DO NOT QUALIFY. I BET THATS TRUE. YOUR INNER SPIRITS ARE NOT TRUE TO YOU SINCE YOU DO NOT KNOW IF YOU ARE MALE OR FEMALE. YOU MUST BE A TOTAL IDIOT AND SO STUPID TO PRESUME THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT GENDER YOU ARE.<br>
:ANYWAYS I WONT HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN SINCE YOU ARE BLOCKED. SO BYE<br>
:ADOIS<br>
:GOODBYE

==Response==

Some [[conservative]] [[blogger]] believes that Sgt. Ramode was set up.[http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous_conservative/2007/03/was_recruiter_s.html] And to tell the truth, he's right. After all, [[the Internet is serious business]], and everything you do on it will be judged for [[lulz]]-worthiness and [[FBI|archived accordingly]].
