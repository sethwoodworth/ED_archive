Confkids
{{ljcomm|Confkids}} is a [[LiveJournal]] community created by [[weev]] to host LJ teleconferences. One day, weev dropped conf info to his f-list. This resulted in about 20 people getting on the conf at once and all simultaneously acting [[fucktarded]]. Weev responded by creating the community as a whitelist to make sure that only cool people got conf info. While several have been denied entrance into the community, the only person ever to receive the banhammer has been {{lj|auntiesiannan}}.
