A corruption of "''What is up, my brother?''." Since it's annoying to say "''wassup''" after Budweiser co-opted it for an advertising gig, we now say ''sup.'' It even works [[IRL]]. 

'''Sup''' is actually a rhetorical question as nobody really cares about anything that is actually up. Plz, don't use a question mark with it or otherwise people will give you their [[life story]].

Some [[13 year old boy|internets experts]] argue that when '''Sup''' is used without a question mark, it isn't a question anymore. Obviously, those experts are [[retard]]s.

If you must answer a "sup", the only correct answers are "nm" or "nmu."

For [[camwhore]]s, "Sup" is the correct method of addressing a *[[chan]], most commonly on [[b|/b/]] by writing said words on a [[penis|body]] [[breasts|part]] or [[dildo|object]]. The appropriate response is to request for them to kindly [[Tits or GTFO|display their mammaries at once or hastily excuse themselves from the board]].
