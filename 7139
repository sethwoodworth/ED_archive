Much like [[Snapesnogger]], Ryoukitten is one of many DeviantART [[furry|Furries]] that believes by (poorly) drawing [[animu]], she will one day travel to Japan and become a totally [[1337]] MANGA ARTIST!

Also like the beliefs of other DevianTarts, she is under the yet-to-be-understood sickness that is often fatal. Said disease usually includes believing in a false idol (themselves and/or their favorite mangaka), believing they have actual talent, and having an odd force that seems to attract the attention of other followers.

On 8/25/07, Ryoukitten was subject to a small raid on her DA account. In a constant pursuit of lulz, anon needed [[moar]] /b/lackup, and the raid was considered a [[failure]].

== Journey to Japan ==
Like any [[weeaboo]], Ryoukitten has taken many ventures into not only drawing, but also animation. Her desire to learn how to animate (ie, more than one frame of work... this is an important concept) has led to such astounding feats as... oh nevermind, it was [[Delete fucking everything|BALEETED]].

What makes no sense is that she is unable to find a program better than fucking [[Windows Movie Maker]] to "animate" her drawings. Better yet, the changing frame sizes is worthy of [[lulz]], and the attempt at a loop is a joke. It is rumored that Ryoukitten may be legally [[retarded|blind]], which would explain her inability to see through her own [[shit]]. If you wish to shatter all her hopes and dreams, telling her that [[furry|furries]] and [[otherkin]] aren't allowed to become great [[wapanese]] artists should probably warrant her to crawl into a [[hugbox]] and hopefully never come out.

== The Attack on Lulz ==

On May 3rd, 2007, Ryoukitten would launch on assault on all that is lulz-worthy when she bitched about a fellow DeviantART who posted a "questionable" image. In total [[MySpace]] fashion, she whined about the picture in her journal.

It is from this journal we can assume Ryoukitten is a [[snob|self righteous]] bitch and should probably be flooded with the [[pain series]], or at least some 9/11 [[copypasta]]. 
The actual picture in question (shown [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/52979114/?qo=22&q=by%3Agore4911&qh=sort%3Atime+-in%3Ascraps here])

== The Kitten gets Desparate ==

[[Image:Desparate_kitten.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Take advantage of this any way you can]]
Like most of us, Ryoukitten has hopes and dreams, however, unlike us, she is a block headed [[weeaboo]] who thinks her [[shit]] don't stink and can someday become a [[winnar]]. As demonstrated above her animation skills are [[lame|below average]] yet this doesn't stop her from thinking she is totally elite and even [http://ryoukitten.deviantart.com/journal/13646601/#comments offer to fling her shit at people] and make them pay for it.

{{quote|I am willing to draw anything for anyone if they want a commission. Tell your friends! Really cheap prices! I might seem desperate, but that's because I am!|~Ryoukitten|you think she'll blow for $2?|}}

Her obvious lack of self respect in this lulz worthy journal calls for [[trolls]] in the way of requesting [[nazi]] or [[9/11]] art. Although unleashing more of her art on the world should be a deadly sin, I would be willing to pay to see her go and get rejected at every animation course she applies for.

But be warned, she means [[serious business]], she's getting her [[The man|daddy]] to buy her shirts.

== Romantic Fantasies ==
A [[google]] search shows that Ryoukitten has shat over more than just Deviantart. Indeed, while her wrath is hard to bear on that site alone, she has also invested her time in [[fanfiction]]. The following is a quote from her fanfiction.net account (Link at bottom):

The entire travesty can be read [http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3603882/1/Fun here]. In addition to her fanfics, she is also prevalent on the following sites:

== First Raid on the Kitten ==
[[Image:Ryouwhine.png|right|thumb|400px|Ryoukitten's BAWWWING over her own ED page ]]
[[Image:Ryoukitten_4chan.jpg|left|thumb|250px|OH GOD, MY EYES! (Note the lazy eye.) ]]
On August 25th, 2007, [[anonymous]] launched a small attack on Ryoukitten's Deviantart account, in an attempt to make her [[final solution|leave the internet]]. The raid was an essential failure, but a small legion of /b/rothers managed to break through the defenses and create [[lulz]] for Ryoukitten to cry about.

Much to anon's surprise, she only disregarded the initial posts about her ED, and, as pictured to the right, considered the internet to be "jealous" and envious" of her work. What she didn't expect was anon's response to her insolence. By not taking the internet [[serious business|seriously]], she basically asked for a raid. As of now, her DA page has calmed down, and some of her various submissions have been commented to in typical /b/ fashion. In an attempt to make herself feel better, and not look like such a whining bitch, she has hidden the original posts about this very ED page.

On September 2nd, 2007, Ryoukitten paid a visit to 4chan's [[/b/]]. The post itself is irrelevant (random [[shit]] about "you no talented [[Jerk|jerks]], that (sic) try to stop artists from going on"), but the picture she used was horrifying enough to make even [[anonymous|Anon]] cry.

== Disasters ==

{{Warning| Possible permanent eye damage ahead}}

Below are some examples of her "work" it's clear that someday she will be a great mangaka:

Notice her ludicrous use of [[lens flare]]s in EVERY photo. Anon has previously been subjected to assaults of her work in numerous threads on both [[/b/]] and more frequently, /ic/. While it is unknown if she is even aware of her work being posted on other sites, the sheer disgust that eminates from her pictures is enough to warrant a [[raid]].
