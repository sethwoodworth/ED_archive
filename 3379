'''GoddessMillenia''', like most girls who use "Goddess" in their screen names, is a [[SIF|not-so-secret internet fatty]] and/or an even fatter [[feminazi]] [[attention whore]]. She is far past her childish desire to ravish [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] or [[Dragonball Z|Frieza]] with her filthy, blubbering vagoo, and has moved onto having an unnecessarily unhealthy addiction with some ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' characters. At a young age, she has far surpassed even ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' fans in her fanatical devotion to a [[gay]] pairing that never once appears in her chosen canon. She is secure in the righteousness of her convictions, though, because we are all idiot homophobes who need to be told the TruFax by a [[16 year old girl]] who is too stupid to spell "millennia" right. 

{{quote|<Blargh> you capitalize words that aren't supposed to be capitalized. for example you capitalized "away" yet away isn't a proper noun.
<GoddessMillenia>Yeah but there's no rule that says you can't. SO fuck off. My teachers never say anything about it.| PM chat entry, although we're still not sure why [[User:Blargh|Blargh]] bothered.}}

== The Moron ==
[[Image:Rose a k a Goddess Millenia by GoddessMillenia.jpg|thumb|left|130px|How GoddessMillenia sees herself.]]
[[At least 100 years ago|Once upon a time]], GoddessMillenia's mother died from [[lie|cancer of the blood]], whatever that is, although everyone knows she probably died after seeing her [[hambeast]] of a daughter's face. Millie wrestled with her [[necrophilia|grief]], but since [[yuri]] is icky, she turned to the video game "''Legacy of Kain''" to satiate her [[fetish]] and redirect it into more [[yaoi|socially acceptable channels]]. Being easily manipulated by game designers who understand the psychology of the [[weeaboo]], she found the evil bishie Raziel [[sick fuck|hot]], and decided to [[rape|pair him up]] with the game's main character, Kain. Afterwords, she found more [[retarded]] ''Legacy of Kain'' [[yaoi]] fans who shared her love for [[vampire]]-[[necrophilia]] goodness, and continued with their support to express her love for corpses.

== Did you know...? ==
[[Image:Morpheel.jpg|thumb|right|How everyone else sees her.]]  
*She claims to be [[lie|bisexual]] and [[lie|knows a pretty girl when she sees one]].
*Her website includes a [http://goddessmillenia.bravepages.com/Fan%20Stuff.html Fan Stuff] page. Notice that it's [[you don't have any friends|empty]].
*Her "love" is [http://goddessmillenia.bravepages.com/Frieza.html "Lord Frieza"] from ''[[Dragonball Z]]''. Apparently she has a thing for giant foreheads.
*Her former "love" was [[Sonic the Hedgehog]]. Yeah, foreheads.
*She gets defensive if you tell her that she is jealous of a video game character. No really.
*She claims that she has a [[Wapanese|Japanese]] friend. One hopes that actual Japanese people are smarter than this, but then again, [[hentai|who knows?]]
*She supports [[hypocrite|Ryoko/Ayeka]].
*One of her [http://youtube.com/user/MadnessGod fans] is a[[13 year old boy]]. Go figure.
*She loves ''The [[Phantom of the Opera]]'', featuring that fag from ''[[TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL|300]]'' and [[Emmy Rossum]]. Further proof that she is [[Fail|made of fail]].
*She goes by the alias Dr. Rockso and poses as a Rock and Roll clown who wears spandex and does cocaine. Her retarded performance earned her a cameo appearance in [[Adult Swim]]'s ''Metalocalypse''. Funny how she's more tolerable as a coke-snorting clown then she is [[IRL|in real life.]] '''FACT:''' You can see her junk through her jumpsuit.
*She is [[lesbian]]-lovers with [http://spardakitten.deviantart.com/ SpardaKitten], who is a catgirl [[fat|carbon copy]] of Millie with artwork that is just as shitty, if not worse.

Every now and then, it brings a warm, fuzzy feeling to watch tartlets turn on other tartlets. In the case of the quotes below, it was not GoddessMillenia's day:

==The Anti-ED-Club==
Moar recently, GM joined the [[lame|Noble]] cause, [[The Anti-ED-Club]]. Despite the fact that it was the kind of [[gay|shit]] Millenia generally [[Legacy of Kain|goes for]], she only showed up to [[tl;dr]] rant about how meny ppl on teh intranets r h8ers, like wtf? and leave. And adding to the [[basement-dweller|general grossness]] that is her being, she showed support for [[furfags|anthro art]]. Like [[Daveykins|many others]] joining the club, she was only there to show how [[lie|not butthurt]] she was by joining an [[13 year old boy|anti-club]].

Unfortunately, the club was banned by [[fags|DA admins.]] riding down from [[Trolldin]] to hand down their mighty can of [[banhammer|whoopass]], leaving Millie struggling to find new [[JewTube|stalking grounds]].

Recently, the crappage has started back up again as actual artists from DA have been pwning her. Since they are actual artists that don't draw yaoi fanshit, she's dragging out the ol' "if you don't like my work you're a dumbass h8er" bullshit. There are some epic examples of millie getting her ass handed to her by these people, such as:


<center>{{morphquote|GMquotes1|background-color: lightgray; width: 50%; height: 340px;|font-weight: bold;
|Sigh.
Just-
Sigh.
I love Legacy of Kain. I'm a long time fan, but your gallery almost makes me feel guilty for this. That shrieking noise is canon being abused for your own fantasies. It's one thing to like a pairing just for the hell of it, but to accuse everyone who points out the fact it's purely fantasy of being homophobic and going through the games with a fine-tooth comb to find any hints as to the "true" pairing is a whole different beast. 
t's sad. It's pathetic. Most of all, it's degrading to the story you're warping.|GM
|I feel I should also point out that it's not possible for Raziel to be paired with -anyone-... I love the guy, but there's just nothing there. He also, y'know, hates Kain for most of the series, a fact a lot of people who jumped onboard the fandom with Defiance seem to miss. 
But, I suppose someone with their head as deeply buried in the sand as you doesn't care about silly ol' canon. Or spelling, apparently...|GM
|I know you must be trying hard when you draw but even you,honey, should be able to tell that your drawings aren't up to standards. Well unless you're in the 3rd grade that is.|GM
|I saw[sic] hypocritical homophobe because you say LoK yaoi pairings of any other persuasion are gross and disgust you.|GM

==Y!Gallery==

After a lull in lulz, a [[Google|magical treasure chest left behind by ancient jew scholars]] showed that not only did fattycakes have a DA gallery full of shit art, she also had a [[Y!Gallery]] of shit art! 

Naturally, a quick search of the profile turned up [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|everything that is wrong in this world]], including a pro [[Family Guy|Stewie/Brian]] club membership. The gallery contains some new [[shit|work]], which somehow manages to be worse than the shit she turns out on DA.

[[Image:Brian Stewie.jpg|frame|center|GOD NO]]

==The Lulz==
[[Image:Hitlerlulz.jpg|thumb|POOL CLOSED DUE TO KAIN AIDS]] 
Some random dude took this article to heart and spammed her shitty [http://pub26.bravenet.com/guestbook/2157960444 guestbook] with ein fünfzig-Führer [[I did it for the lulz|for the lulz]]. She promptly banned his IP address, remaining [[fucktard|woefully ignorant]] that IP addresses can be ''changed''.

You can spot Millie e-stalking her [[straight|enemies]] on [[JewTube]], having her friends delete all comments so she can [[fail|triumph]] for great justice. In the process, she spews out some hilarious YouTube tantrums, such as this one:

{{squote|I can't believe they would actually pursue the flaming and spamming to his Main Page! He deleted all their comments anyways.
It's completely ridiculous that they can even consider themselves True Legacy of Kain, Sailor Moon, and Tenchi Muyo Fans. It's an insult to those very Series. They're Fucking Ignorant pieces of Shit. What kind of Immature, Instigating, Dumb Asses do this? The fact that RoseDincht dares to insult Akane, who is the best Legacy of Kain artist in the world. That she goes into LOK LJ communities every few months flaming Yaoi. I mean, Their comebacks were things like "Your Mother". They act like they are in Preschool. I think it's like CD said, we need to just ignore them. People like these don't need to be encouraged to continue this behavior. '''Their Parents should have Beat them when they were younger.'''|Millie, displaying the compassion that is her trademark.}}

She was recently [[pwned]] by someone giving a surprisingly accurate description of this article, calling Millie on her childish bullshit. Her comment was promptly and thoughtfully deleted, but replaced with another user's, saying nearly the same thing.

{{squote|You make me ashamed to be a female LoK fan...And that's saying a lot since I used to be one out of... about five. Voice actors joking around equals indications of a subtext in the story? You put our fandom to shame.|LauraOrganaSolo, pwning for the team}}

Millie [[fail|employed]] her old [[troll|tactic]] of following and harassing people to their own page, all while screaming"[[attention whore|stop harassing me]]!"
[[Image:lauraorganarawks.png|thumb|Even the ''Legacy of Kain'' fangirls are aware that GM is a [[fucktard]].]]
[[Image:Sockmonkeysrock.jpg|thumb|Even the [[sockpuppet]]s want to kick her ass.]]

{{squote|I never said anyone was or wasn't in a scene. 
Maybe you should remotely know what the fuck you're talking about before flaming my page. Of course what can I expect from someone who spells Kindergarten 'Kindergarth' . 

You should follow your own friend's advice she gave to another person she fought with: "Ohhhh, I thought you were tired of me. Still coming back for more? Usually when you block someone it's 'Oh hey, I'm done with you, conscider yourself forgotten.' " 

She should also learn her history. Hitler didn't want to kill all gays, he wanted to kill Jewish Gays. Some of his own Nazis Soldiers were gay.|Millie, forgetting that most of the gay Nazis were [[pwn|killed]] in the SA purge.}}

She has also taken up the [[masturbation|pastime]] of rewriting [[history]], because any source of history (that isn't [[German]]) will tell you that [[the man|Hitler]] wanted all but the [[white people|master race]] to die. He wanted to [[delete fucking everything|exterminate]] [[Al Sharpton|blacks]], [[SpongeBob Squarepants|gays]], [[DJRaziel|Gypsies]], [[Freddie Mercury|Jews]], all kinds of ill [[shit]], but he was only really [[shotgun mouthwash|successful]] mit den Juden, and even then he killed off people who were ''maybe'' third-generation Jews. Hitler was just doing it for the lulz, which we'll all agree is admirable, and Millie is doing it for the anti-lulz, which makes her an excellent candidate for a retroactive abortion.

Proving how much of a [[Cunt]] she really is

{{squote|This isn't Myspace. This is a place for ART. You hear that,

A

R

T

ART. It isn't a place for you to post pictures of yourself in a non-artistic way.

And you go "Well others do it so I can", just call the wahmbulance right now. An idiot only proves they are one when they follow other people's stupidity.

You ignoring this comment will only prove how scared you are. You’re afraid of the truth. The truth you hypocrite is that you don't even follow rules that you seem to force on others.
Grow some balls and take a freaking art course. You aren't going to get an art scholarship, or become successful unless you start learning how to be a better person.|Deviantard, on a photo of Millie}}

== The fight against the Lulz begins ==
[[Image:Goddessmillenialmfu.PNG|thumb|left|[[butthurt|NONE OF THAT SHIT IS TRUE]].]]
[[Image:Butthurtbitch.jpg|thumb|Still a crybaby pussy]]
Millie says that "creating an article on a parody website isn't going to effect anybody." In an effort to show just how much she doesn't care, she created a [[shit|parody]] of an ED article, which failed it ''hard'' because you can't attack ED while claiming not to care about it, dumbass. She also sent her [[bitch|boyfriend]] DJRaziel127 to try to [[baleet]] it, but naturally he [[fail|failed]]. He then [[Get on irc fgt|got on IRC]] and [[butthurt|whined and cried]] about how his girlfriend's artwork was [[copyright|copyrighted]] and that [[lawsuit|ED would be sued]]. In the course of the [[Internet trial]], [[Detective|ED's e-detectives]] discovered an [[Xbox|HUEG]] [http://goddessmillenia.bravepages.com/Frieza/Frieza%20Pictures.html cache] of copyrighted artwork from both [[Dragonball Z|Funimation]] and Eidos on her website, including lots and lots of screenshots, none of which had copyright acknowledgments. Surprise surprise, Millie is a [[liar]] and a corporate [[whore]].

Recently, after [[stalker|e-stalking]] one of her many enemies from video to video, she released a [[butthurt|shit-storm]] on one of her [[bitch|friend's]] YouTube pages. After queefing out paragraph after paragraph of childlike [[lie|taunts]] and butthurt, she just got a friend to [[baleet]] it all. She also had her friends come to ED in order to [[pwn]] her mortal enemies, but they ultimately failed and provided the site with more [[lulz]].

== Fanfiction and Fanart ==
Because she's such a [[sick fuck]], Millie often daydreams about [[Hitler]] and [[Michael Jackson]] having [[buttsex]], sex changes, STDs, and the ever-popular [[rape]]. This is an example of her [[shit|best]] work:

''Once upon a time, there was a well known Whore by the name of RoseDincht who had a sex change at age 9. Her father, Adolf Hitler, touched her and sexually abused her. Her mother, Micheal Jackson, paid for her sex change. He thought it would be good to have a son instead of a daughter. So, she now has a pair of balls and a penis. RoseDincht tried to not show that she was a male, but was hard. All those short skirts her mother, Micheal, bought her showed everything. In about 26 years into the future, She will die of every sexually transmitted diseases from all those men she had sex with because she was to awful to be on welfare and was unemployable. That will be the happiest day for people better then RoseDincht. (pretty much everyone)
hurray. she will die!''

*If the creators of the game did not say that Kain/Raziel is canon, '''they are wrong'''.
*If it didn't really happen in canon, then it was meant to be.
*Being [[bitch|friends]] means "ganging" up on one of her many [[Heterosexual|enemies]].
*Something happening to someone else makes you the [[insane|victim]].
*Making other people the victim makes you the [[batshit insane|victim]].
*Straight pairings are [[Almost raped|icky]].
{{co|GoddessMilleniasSeekreetz|[Had enough ?]|[Moar seekreetz]|0|
*You have to be bisexual to know what tits look like.
*Two dead guys is [[buttsecks|teh sex]].
*Anyone who disagrees with you is [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|fucking ignorant]].
*The only true pairing is the one you make up.
*Haruka/Usagi from [[Sailor Moon]] are canon. [[srsly]].
*If you make fun of yaoi in a fanfiction, or say that you hate any of the games in the series, then you are on drugs.
*If you do drugs/alcohol, you are not a TRUE fan of ''[[Legacy of Kain]]''
*If you keep that cabbage comin', she'll get you what you want, '''the way you want it.'''
*"''Calling it quits''" means "''I'm going to get my puppets to go after you, but fail like the internet tough guys we are''."
*If you don't like her vampire yaoi, then you are a homophobe and you don't support the gays. So cancel your PFLAG membership, you lying [[hypocrite]].
*[[Buttsecks]] is so fuckin' romantic.
*Joining ED to edit an article about yourself means that [[lie|you don't care what it says]].
*[[denial|ED is Hypocritical]] and Hypocritical, like most words, is a Proper Noun, as is Yaoi.
*Incest was the only way to go in the [[At least 100 years ago|olden days]].
*[[not|Baleeting]] an ED article the second time around will work.
*Someone using the same kind of phrasing you do means that that person is your cockpuppet, even if you have better things to do than make fake accounts and troll her.
*It is in no way hypocritical for her to do the same thing.
*72 million is close to a billion.
*Hitler died alone (and Eva Braun is just made up).
*She is a better artist than "Pacasso" who was apparently [[lol|unable to draw proportionally]][http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Images/Picasso-Harlequin-1.jpg]
*[[Legacy of Kain]] was about religion and romance, a swashbuckling, KainAIDs-filled adventure.
*RoseDincht is the cause for all [[Holocaust|suffering]] in the world.
*If she makes it, it's a [[denial|typo]]. If you make it, you're [[DJRaziel|retarded]].
*The more friends you have on DeviantART, the better your art is.
*Being a friend of RoseDincht means you're immature and must be banned
*Every day is opposite day.
*Asheville, NC is the [[lie|second gayest]] city in [[America]].
*[[you are doing it wrong|Constructive criticism]] is the work of a troll.
*The ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' fandom began in 2003, when Defiance was released. Nevermind the fact that the first game of the series, Blood Omen, was released [[at least 100 years ago|about a decade ago]].
*[[pimp|Vorador]] would choose his [[necrophilia|dead father]] who's hidden [[basement dweller|in the basement]] over a harem of living, breathing, [[whore|naked chicks]].
*If you like yuri more than you like yaoi, you're a dumb, dirty, [[dyke]].
*If you [[IAWTC|agree with her]], you are frendz 4 life.

== At the end of some long, bloody struggle ==   
[[Image:Milleniafagga.PNG|thumb|]]

'''FACT:''' RoseDincht is unaware that she is fighting with Amy Lee, [[Utada Hikaru]], or those two faggots from [[X-Play]] on the Internet.   

In a final act of [[butthurt]], Millie finally [[Deleting your LiveJournal|called it quits]]. Though this was '''The End''', [[DJRaziel]] immediately began to edit this page only two days after the whole [[drama]] supposedly concluded. So much for [[lie|not being affected by an article on a parody site]].

Even after [[DJRaziel|DJRaztampon]] was sent scuttling back to his [[bitch|mommy]], further [[lulz]] were endangered by two users, [[User:Violet|Violet]] and someone stealing [[User:Rosedincht|Rosedincht]]'s screen name. Their [[troll|reaction]] to this article was to [[Delete fucking everything]], so it is safe to assume they were either [[sockpuppet|sockpuppets]] or Millie [[Hitler|herself]]. [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|Inevitably]], they failed, leaving the rest of us with [[lollergasm|lollergasms]] as we reverted all changes made.

==Kissyangel is GoddessMillennia?==

{{squote|It’s me: Krissyangel, aka GoddessMillennia, aka Rose Dahlberg. Yes, I’m Krissyangel. I am issuing a Formal apology and a Confession, so Bear with me if it Gets a Little tl;dr. because of My being Featured on Encyclopedia Dramatica, I have Become aware of Just how many People hate Me. I Created the Krissyangel account to give Myself some Support, but even That hasn’t Stemmed the Tide. So I have Decided to Make an Apology.|GoddessMillennia, they don't make hugboxes big enough.}}

Yes that's right, [http://krissyangel.deviantart.com/ Krissyangel], a pro-Millenia troll is really Millie herself! This comes as a shock to [[noone]], because Krissyangel is one of the few DevianTARTs more retarded than GM herself.

GM says, in short, that ED was right and that she is retiring to work on her artistic skilz, no longer clogging up the [[internets|tubes]] with her rule 34.

{{squote|I realize that This is Unusually eloquent for Me, but I’ve Decided to try Becoming more Mature. This means No more e-stalking, no More flamewars, and no more Bossing people around. So I have Decided to Retire from DA and work on My artistic Skills which, I have to Confess, are below even My Standards. Much of the Activity you have Seen and will see From my other Account are my Friends, who Have taken my Password and tried to Take on my Detractors. It was a very Noble, if Misguided gesture. I Apologize to the staff of DA as Well, if they Feel the need to Suspend both of My accounts, so Be it. I Am Ready To Take Whatever’s Coming to Me.|GoddessMillennia, doing [[an hero|the right thing]].}}

Even her pathetic [[cunts|friends]] attempted to defend her by hacking her DA page and [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/5359608/729799370 sending out comments]. This is just another fumble in the lifelong abortion that is Millie's life.

{{squote|I think one of the reasons I am singled out in the fandom is because I'm not a part of the majority.
I am neither on the yaoi fans nor anti-yaoi fans side. Yaoi fans have a constant habit of supporting illogical pairings, while anti-yaoi fans bitch hypocritically about them doing so, simply supporting het pairings because it's not yaoi even though are not only illogical, they're impossible.|Lies, lies, and more lies.}}

But apparently she is in fact made of lies, because she has moved on to a new DA account, [http://blackflame95.deviantart.com/ Blackflame95](troll accordingly). She insists that OMG it isn't her u gaiz, but after three minutes of reading her dumbass comments, the truth comes out.

{{squote|I'm not GoddessMillenia!|"Blackflame", even running cannot save you.}}

==JUST KIDDING GAIZ==
Millie had yet another Jewtube shit fit sometime [[Last Thursday|last Thursday]]. [[At least 100 years ago|A few months ago]], someone posted a comment on this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc8PoxBT60w|this piece of shit] pointing out that Kain and Raziel can't have babies. Millie proceeded to get butthurt and did her usual spiel. She was promptly [[pwned]].

If you see her doing any more lulzy things, cap that shit, or precious lulz may be lost forever.


EDIT - She's back again. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc8PoxBT60w No real lulz at the moment] but at least it confirms that she's not [[an hero]] just yet. Plus she dropped some more true gems, such as:

{{squote|I love how extremely ignorant fucks think that only words that can be capitalized are at the beginning of a sentence and pronouns. I also absolutely adore how people deny that they aren't hypocritical homophobes, yet don't hesitate to call someone a 'fucking faggot'. Well it's been fun, perhaps a little too fun. However as previously mentioned by others, your childish, immature, and ineffective insults are beginning to bore me.

==MOAR FUCKTARDERY==
She's returned to dA AGAIN. She is, of course, continuing to be a fucktard about everything from the correct British English spelling of "colour" to, of course, her favorite yaoi pairing. If you see anything, cap that shit and add it to this gallery:

Also worth noting: she has a [http://pub26.bravenet.com/faq/show.php?usernum=2157960444&catid=9161 FAQ Page] on her website that's loaded with more priceless quotes. One of these gems happens to be the following:

[[Image:MillieFAQ.png]]

It is pointed out that "asexual" can refer either to a lack of gender '''or''' a lack of sexual orientation. 

{{squote|Religion Angers me because People <b>Blindly and Mindlessly follow and Believe in something that has no evidence to back it up.</b>|GoddessMillennia, on hypocrisy}}

Breaking News - Millie is posting Sonic [http://goddessmillenia.deviantart.com/art/Sonic-R-2-Concept-Art-85949385 shit] now!

FROM THE ICU!

{{squote|Unfortunately, I'm not doing too well. I'm actually in a very serious critical condition. 
<b>Anyways, I just got a new Sega Dreamcast that actually works beautifully.</b> |GoddessMillennia, staring death down with the latest, most cutting edge technology.}}

In June 2008, a relatively sane [[Legacy of Kain]] [[fantard|fangirl]] tried to confront GoddessDelusional with quotes from an interview with one of the game series' creators denouncing any potential for Raziel's sex life (Game Informer asked ''"Is there a lucky lady in Raziel's future?"'' and director Amy Hennig answered ''"I don't know how lucky she'd be - Raziel's jaw isn't the only thing that got burned off in the vortex."''). 

Millie's response? To hide the comment. 

The same thing happened when someone posted an interview with ''Sailor Moon'' creator Naoko Takeuchi confirmed that Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune were [[lesbian|lesbos]], in spite of Millie's insistence that Sailor Uranus had some kind of relationship with Sailor Moon.
