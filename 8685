== Origins ==

The Marines began their humble beginning where most awesome organizations start, In a bar! The United States Marine Corps was founded in Tun Tavern in 1775 by a bunch of drunken idiots who thought it would be cool to shoot shit. Many Marines were required to provide their own food, alcohol and rifle to be eligible for enlistment in the organization. Much to their surprise, shooting shit on a cold boat in the middle of the ocean was a lot less fun then when talked about in drunken bar conversation.

After this humble beginning, many Marines take pride in their heritge by doing what they did at their founding. Getting drunk and eating lots of cake. They do this every year on November 10th, the day that they founded there "military institution".

== Mission ==

The Marines have two missions:

'''Mission One:'''

To get drunk as often as possible, to steal other peoples girlfriends, to go to strip clubs as often as possible and to pick bar fights with people whom are weaker then themselves.

This Mission is usually under-way during any period of time not spent fighting some third world country in the middle of no-where. Most Marines consider it their personal mission to annoy and piss off as many people as possible during peace-time because they have nothing else to do but masterbait and play [[Halo 2]].

'''Mission Two:'''

To be dropped off in the middle of some wasteland with little to no supplies, ammunition and weapons, and then expected to kill everything in sight based off of pure motivation to rip off the heads of their enemies and shit down their necks.

The Marine Corps website was designed with you in mind. That is, designed to warp the minds of young stupid teenagers who are too dumb to go to college.

The website contains a lot of stories designed to stimulate the Alpha Male gene in most idiotic teenagers and convince them that being a Marine makes you a hero.
