'''May 10th is the 4th world wide protest of [[Scientology]] by [[Anonymous]]. "Battletoad Earth" is named after a very shitty movie and a very difficult video game. "Battlefield Earth" is based on a book written by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] starring closet homosexual John Travolta. "[[Is This Battletoads|Battle Toads]]" was a game for the [[NES]] that took either a lot of practice, or a lot of cheating to beat. The Battletoads killed aliens and doesn't afraid of anything.  On 5/10, Anonymous take to the streets and speak against the evils of the Church of Scientolgy's Fair Game Policy.  Fair Game is basically Scientology's idea that they can fuck over anyone that speaks against the <s>church</s> cult.  This includes stalking people, suing people, harassing people, framing people, posting [[goatse]] on their myspace in order for them to be as [[LRH]] said [[nazi|"shuddered into silence" and "utterly ruined"]]'''.

:* When "Fair Game" and subjects such as [[Xenu]] or Body Thetans are brought up, Scientologists often try to change the subject and attack you, asking what criminal acts you have on your conscience or if you are payed by the drug cartells or the [[Marcabs|German Government]]. 


:* According to Scientology all critics of Scientology are criminals, that's why they are critics. Nice logic. This is simply standard Scientology tech, it's part of the training they have payed a fortune to learn. Hubbard said so, period.



:* If you manage to see through their stupid personal attacks and desperate distractions, you may manage to force them to ward it off by telling you the Fair Game policy letter was cancelled in 1968. But keep in mind that Scientologists are trained to lie and never defend, always attack <br>.... (and generate money).

:* This HCO Policy Letter (HCO P/L) does not cancel the policy, it only cancels the use of the term 'Fair Game'.

:*It states <u>clearly</u> that the practice described in the policy (deprived of property, injured, tricked, sued, lied to or destroyed) is not canceled.

:* The "Church" of Scientology does not change anything because it's wrong, no, they change it because it gives bad PR.
