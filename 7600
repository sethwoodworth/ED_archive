We all know tracing and paint overs are horrible eye murdering abominations to the art world, and are even too lulz worth for DeviantART, but it's not safe to go back to surfing the tubes yet folks! Yes, those two have a long lost sister, only this time even less work and talent is applied.
here we can give you tips on how to be an awesome artist! 

# use Google
# search for something like [[wolf]], fox, [[cat]] 
# download the first image you see
# open your pirated copy of [[photoshop]]
# creatively smear the crap out of it with the smudge tool
# save and upload to DeviantART 
# sit back and enjoy the fame!
# open up commissions for smudged work then decline offers when there's nothing to steal.
# ????
#10 PROFIT!

Don't forget to use the images off of the first, second or third page so everyone can recognize your [[lies|'inspiration']]

You ask how do you tell if something was smudged? For one, some smudge artists don't resize images they find, lighting is perfect when all 'drawn' images suck, or just zoom in close enough to see the original pixels left from said photo. That and there is always layovers.

==But It's Art!!!==
Smudge painters will try to defend their talent to their grave, saying such funny things such as "[[retard|i don't like you stealing my art and altering it]]" when faced with evidence of a layover to show their 'process'. Don't be fooled with reversed engineered tutorials. Friends of smudge artists will also defend their buddy's work [[stupid|totally ignoring the blatant theft]].
