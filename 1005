'''The Björk''' (also known as '''The [[Jesus|Savior]] of [[Sweden|Iceland]]'''), is a [[Torpark|Chinese]]-looking, singer-songwriter, actress, composer, and music producer. [[Some argue]] that Björk is  [[Unwarranted Self Importance|supernatural]], possibly an [[Dyke|elf]], [[Gay|fairy]], [[Mexico|alien]], or some other such bizarre [[Rosie O'Donnell|creature]]. It is wise to approach the Björk carefully, as it is known to go [[Batshit|fucking insane]], for little to no reason at all. Possibly, its equally insane [[Ricardo Lopez|fans]] are to blame.

Many [[Basement Dweller|people]] [[Attention Whore|claim]] to have experienced "björk". 

==I'm Not Björking With You==
I live in an apartment in [[N00b|New B]]jörk City. [[Shit nobody cares about|Once upon a time]] I walked in on my brother [[masturbation|Björking]] off to a [[Pr0n|Björk]] Out Infomercial as he yelled, "If it ain't [[Tourettes|Björk]] don't fix it!" 
When my [[Incest|dad]] came home from [[Work|Björk]], my dog [[Bestiality|Björked]] at him so loud I fell off my [[Skateboard-City|skateBjörk]] and [[Waaaambulance|Björk]] my arm.
At dinner, I picked up my [[Forced meme|Björk]] and spoon to eat some [[Pig|Björk]] [[Food|Björked]] beans but my mother told me, "No [[Rules|elBjörks]] on the table," to which I promptly replied, "[[Internet Tough Guy|Björk]] off."
