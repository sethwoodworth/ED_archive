Fasttracker 2
FastTracker 2 was a popular music creation program used for making really shitty 8-bit [[chiptunes]], like the one that was playing in that flashy [[Photoshop]] [[keygen]] that gave you [[AIDS]].

== The Tracker Culture ==
Trackers are used by [[skript kiddies]] and [[basement dwellers]] who are part of the "demoscene." Fasttracker 2 was the most famous tracker program ever. The kind of people that use Fasttracker 2 are the same people who think computers were better in 1992 than they are now.

== How it Works ==
In FastTracker you load sound samples <del>that you [[pirate#Web Pirates|pirated]] off of [[LimeWire]]</del> from your computer and use your keyboard to play the sample at different frequencies. To create music, you press record, then pound your fist randomly into your keyboard. Hard. Then you load up a percussion sound for a beat, go to track 2, and pound your fist on the keys again. This should produce a musical ensemble (and profuse bleeding from the ears and/or [[buttsecks|other orifices]]) that you can submit to Modarchive.com and gain the appreciation of the most pathetic [[nerds]] you've never heard of.
