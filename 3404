Gonads and Strife

'''Gonads and Strife''' is one of the first popular [[unfunny]] internet [[meme]]s.  It begins with a singing squirrel, who bounces around to a sped-up [[guitar]] track, ranting incoherently about [[drugs]] while yelling "[[Wii|WEEEEEE]]!"

The flash animation is made further unfunny by the [[fuck|insertion]] of various images to personify "gonads" (a [[penis]], [[Ron Jeremy]]) and "strife" (lightning, [[Stephen Hawking]]).

It is purported that Web 2.0 was the result of an attempt to make an entity completely free of Gonads and Strife.
