Bot

A bot is a program that acts like a person on the [[internets]], much like RL robots are meant to do things for people. Bots are typically used for tasks that people don't want to do, like [[Fake editor|repeating the same boring action 10,000 times.]]

==Theory of Bot Internets==
[[Some argue]] that certain [[4chan|parts]] of the [[Gurochan|internets]] are too [[Anthropophobia|fucked up]] to be used by human beings. It is hypothesized that in fact the users of these websites and forums are entirely composed of poorly coded bots which overthrew their cruel [[programmer]]s and left for phatter pipes. That girl you were cybering with was being run on a G5 Mac. A Mac made you have an orgasm; this makes you [[gay]].
