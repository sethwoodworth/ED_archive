'''Chris Benoit''' (Toothless "Roid Rage" Wolverine) was a messiah-type [[wrestling|wrestler]] and a spicy slice of [[Canada|Canadian Bacon]]. All wrestling fans [[erection|got hard]] for him the instant his name was mentioned and worshiped him as a [[God]]. Although many liken Chris to being [[an hero | an hero]] for fucking up so many people and being an icon for socially inept nerds who worship Canadians as their superiors, it's really the same thing as paying someone for giving a [[hooker|mean blowjob]]. He became [[an hero]] on June 25th, 2007, leading to much uproar, sadness, and despair as [[at least 100|many thousands]] of smart marks discovered that their God of Wrestling was not only dead, but also a baby killer. Finally, someone raided this [http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2409079362 facebook].  It should be noted that Benoit brings the total of pro wrestlers that died in the year [[2007]] to [[at least 100|around 114]]. 

==The man, the myth, the legend==
===The Early Years===
[[Image:Chris benoit murder.jpg|thumb|Chris Benoit was known for his breathtaking technique]]
When '''Chris Benoit''' (pronounced Ben-WAH like a [[redundant|gay Frenchman]]) was at the supple young age of ten, [[not_gay|he found himself deeply fascinated with watching men smothering their naked bodies against each other for sport]]. This prompted him to become a wrestler, so he could live out his wildest [[homosexual]] fantasies, without being [[Matthew Shepard|shunned and hated]] by his family. In 1985 he began his wrestling career, and was soon having simulated sex with big beefy men each and every day -- naturally enjoying every second of it. Although his first match was against "Lovehandles" Lenny Lampshade, from which he was disqualified for getting an erection, and his second match against "Windsailor" Wendell Woody having the same result, none should ever know of his [[Fred Phelps|hidden lusts and desires.]] 

Chris shortly became a wrestling legend, [[oral|sucking]] and [[anal sex|fucking]] his way to the top, and rumor has it he lost his tooth while being orally jackhammered by Ric Flair and the rest of the members of the Four Horsemen upon being initiated into the extremely popular clique of sociopathic manwhores. Despite this, due to his height and the fact that he was heterosexual looking, Benoit would not win his many championships until he joined the WWF as the WCW discriminated against short gay men who could pass as straight and were under six feet tall.

===Signs of a killer===

In 1994, during a match on [[WWE|ECW]], he wrassled and nearly killed his opponent, [[indian|Suicidal Sabu]], by dropping him on his head and [[LOL|breaking his neck.]] Although it looks [[death|fatal]], [[kill it with fire|Sabu is not one that can be killed by breaking his neck.]] In fact, the next night. Sabu wrestled an old [[fag|man]] in a ring that was covered in barbed wires and literally [[emo|cut himself]] to near [[an hero|death]]. Knowing his plan has failed to kill Sabu, Benoit went in a [[insane|maniacal rage]] that he took out on himself by injecting steroids into his [[buttsecks|ass]] and from that point on... [[lolcow|He was on a mission to kill everyone that looked at him funny.]]

===Victim #1===
[[Image:CBBastard.jpg|thumb|Just kickin' back in the den.]]
In the early part of 1997, Chris Benoit met Nancy Daus, his future wife and murder victim. It is worth nothing that Nancy was previously married to another [[faggot|wrestler]] who was also a Satanist, but when the script called for her to fake-cheat on her [[IRL]] husband with Benoit, she began cheating with him [[IRL]] as well. Classy people, to be sure. He then fathered a buttbaby with her named [[shota|Daniel]], who is rumored to have been injected with human growth hormones so that he would never suffer the same discrimination that Chris Benoit had suffered from, due to being under six feet tall.

In February 2000, Chris married Nancy Daus to veil his [[Gay|sinful tendencies]] after five years of living in sin. Nancy Daus retired from the wrestling world to be a full-time mother, much to the horror of thousands of wrestling fans who would [[masturbate|jack off]] to her whenever she was on camera.

===Weapon X===
[[Image:Benoit.jpg|thumb|Kid shoulda tapped]]
[[Image:BENOITALL3BELTS.jpg|thumb|[[Winnar]]]]
It has come to the attention of most major news outlets that Chris "The [[Canada|Canadian]] Child Killer" Benoit's son suffered from a rare and terrible [[GRIDS|disease]] named "Weapon X". Some say that this may have led to the [[Goofy Time]] that resulted in the murders, as Chris Benoit and his wife were struggling to deal with the effects Weapon X had on their son. Weapon X is characterized by such symptoms as an unbreakable skeleton, abnormally large balls, regenerative abilities, being involved in 90% of Marvel comics catalog, and the almost uncontrollable uttering of the word 'bub' and phrase 'I'm the best at what I do, but what I do isn't very nice, bub' (there it is <i>again</i>!).

William Stryker could not be reached for comment.

Matt Striker, however, could be, but [[nobody gives a shit|nobody cared]].

Investigators speculate that Benoit must have [[WebMD|read somewhere]] that he could cure his son's fail with anabolic steroids, and proceeded to inject his son [[in the ass]] whenever he juiced it up himself.  Still, there has been much debate as to the purpose of the 'roids found at the Benoit home, which undoubtedly were used by at least one of the three deceased parties.  However, recent DNA evidence supports the theory that Benoit's son was in fact the one to blame for the incident.

===Wrestlefaggotry===
On March 14, 2004, at WrestleMania XX, The Retarded Wolverine won the World Heavyweight Championship. He destroyed Shawn [[cockmongler|"I'll Suck Your Cock"]] Micheals by telling [[cockmongler|Shawn]] that there is no God, and then forced Triple [[goatse|"I'm In Your Ass"]] H to tap out to his signature submission move, the Crippled-Child Smotherer. He also left bibles by both of their carcasses. [[Shit nobody cares about| This was the first time a roided up wrestler won the Heavyweight championship by a submission, and not a corny power move.]] To celebrate this emotional victory, years in the making, Benoit brought his beloved wife and [[asspie|autistic child]] into the ring. He held them so tight security had to be brought in to remove his family from the Retarded Wolverine clutch. Critics would say this was a sign of things to come, but [[retards|wrestling fans]] simply stated that Benoit was overcome with the emotion of defeating two of the most feared [[homos|wrestlers]] in the WWE and wanted his family to feel his pain.

==The Death of Chris Benoit==
[[Image:Chris_Coffin.jpg|thumb|Come on in Chris, the lining is great!]]

A month before the [[murder|homicide]], Chris was doing [[whore|tricks]] for a couple of drug dealers, to obtain [[jenkem|steroids]] that would make his [[cock]] nice and beefy. Not wanting his son to feel left out, and because his son could not pwn [[John Cena]] (Worst Wrestler Evar) he injected some of these roids into him so they could [[69]] each other with ease. Sadly, the drugs didn't take effect fast enough, and Benoit killed his son out of roid rage. He then went to kill his wife, [[for the lulz]].

Chris Benoit became [[an hero]] on June 25th, 2007. Basically, if [[Anna Nicole Smith]]'s death and [[OJ Simpson]]'s double homicide had a baby, it would produce this. No one really knows how they died, who did it, and it's slowly tearing the world apart.  The best explanation for his [[Britney Spears|insane rampage]] is because he went [[retard|crazy]] from the continuous use of 'roids ever since forevar.

== Chris "The Rassling Ripper" Benoit, serial killer? ==
[[Image:Benoit.gif|thumb|Chris loves the children]]
[[Image:Benoit simpsons.jpg|thumb|Benoit wears his favorite Simpsons t-shirt.]]
Benoit has shown signs of being a cold blooded murder in a interview with Brett Hoffman on WWE.com 
concerning his thoughts on the movie See No Evil.[http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/archive/snebenoit] According to officials, Nancy was bound at the wrists and feet, with a towel wrapped around her body, and blood was found underneath her head. A [[Bible|Spiderman comic book]] was also reportedly found near each one of the bodies leading [[the man|investigators]] to believe that Benoit was mildly retarded and may have [[downs syndrome]]. Police have also confirmed that [[over nine thousand]] prescription drugs and steroids were found inside the house, and that Benoit was found hanging in a weight room in his house. Cops say that he used a cord from one of his workout machines as a makeshift noose, while a hood was over his head and his hand superglued to his dick for comic effect.

As of late, it has come to light that the murder of his slut and retarded son were not his first killings. Benoit has been slowly killing his friends and co-workers for a number of years and disguising the crimes to [[Metal_Gear_Solid|make them seem like it was heart attacks]] and O.D.'s, etc, this only came to light when an investigation by a Private Dick/Mick Hucknall look-a-like called Dave Shing uncovered a correlation  between Benoits matches and the discovery of bodies. 

Below is a list of all Benoit's confirmed kills and their age, year of murder and original recorded cause's of death:

==WWE's butthurt reaction==
[[Image:Chris benoit martial status.jpg|thumb|Chris has updated his marital status.]]
In the aftermath of Chris Benoit getting all juiced up and [[pwning]] his family, the WWE canceled their 3 hour Monday Night Raw in Corpus Christi, [[Texas]]. This episode was to feature people commenting on the fake death of Vince McMahon, but Vince pussied out because it would be "in bad taste." As a result [[over nine thousand]] [[retards|wrestling fans]] weren't able to watch their favorite [[faggots|performers]] in action and simulate [[fellatio]] on one another. As of this time the WWE is not sure if they will refund the money or offer free tickets to all those who spent [[welfare|their hard earned money]] to watch the show.

===[[BAWWW|BAAWWWWWWW]]===
After their 3-hour show of crying into their [[hugbox]] and saying how Chris is in heaven now ('cuz homicidal/suicidal maniacs get 1st-class seats in heaven, [[amirite]]?) immediately started to plan how they could exploit his death for [[moar]] [[money|monies]]. However it was during this scammin' that they actually realized what Benoit had done. WWE immediately gave up caring about Benoit and proceeded to [[delete fucking everything]] related to Chris Benoit on the website except for the headlines, which were now generating lulz instead of tears.

When WWE saw the police press conference they were quick to whine and bitch that Benoit's [[Virginia Tech massacre|fun-spree]] was not the result of 'roid rage with a list of [[lies|carefully explained criticisms]] of the press release from the Atlanta Police [http://www.prowrestling.com/article/news/5009], like a [[fanboy]] who reads a bad magazine review of a game and then cries to the whole world how they know nothing about games, despite being professionals of their job and him being a [[13-year-old boy|13 year-old fag]]. It is most likely this is Vince's way of making people avoid investigating the drugs in case they find out that he was the one who gave Benoit the steroids, syringe, electrical tape, bibles, towel and noose, all [[for the lulz]].

===Why the WWE is fucked===
[[Image:bitches dont know benoit.JPG|thumb|Bitches know now]]
Did you know:
*For years, the WWE's business model has depended on [[boring|family-friendly entertainment]]? [[redneck|What parents]] will take their kids to see such [[GRIDS|positive]] role models now, after one of them killed a [[child|7 year old]]?
*The WWE has always favored wrestlers with size over ones with actual skill, increasing the pressure to take [[steroid]]s?
*Vince McMahon has [[retard|already admitted]] to using [[steroid]]s in the past, and within the past year added pounds of muscle mass seemingly overnight, despite the fact that he is in his [[old|60s]]?

===Ruh-roh!!===
On August 30, afraid of further [[serious business|federal investigation]], the WWE announced that it was giving half of its on-screen talent the [[banhammer]] for [[steroids|violations]] of its [[GRIDS|wellness policy]]. They also disclosed that many of their more popular [[faggot|wrestlers]] had been taking drugs to prevent them from getting [[breasts|manboobs]] that coincide with heavy steroid use. It is likely that this massive and lulzy display of self-pwnage will be insufficient to stay the WWE's fate.

==ITS A CONSPIRACY==
[[Image:Its a conspiracy.jpg|thumb|]]
===TOW Accomplice to Murder===
[[Image:Beniot.jpg|thumb|right|[[This looks shopped|not photoshopped]], Benoit had wiki-precog]]
According to [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,287194,00.html Faux News], some retard posted about the wife's death on Wikipedia 18 hours before the cops actually found the bodies.  The IP address that  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Benoit&diff=next&oldid=140425583 the edit] was made from traces back to Stamford, Connecticut, which is where WWE headquarters just happens to be located.  That's some fuckin' coincidence, [[amirite]]?

It is interesting to note that a WP editor tried to discuss Benoit's death, on the talk page for Benoit's [[TOW]] article, but [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Moe_Epsilon some cocksucking faggot asshole] said it wasn't relevant to the article (lol, wut?) and [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|baleeted the whole discussion]].

Since even a [[wikipedo]] like Moe can't be that fucking stupid, we're only left to conclude that Wikipedia is an accomplice to the murder and was trying to cover the whole thing up.  It all makes sense.  [[TOW]] DID CHRIS BENOIT'S WIFE AND SON, AMIRITE? [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AChris_Benoit&diff=140727604&oldid=140724093 Read moar] for great justice.

===Moar evidence===
In December 2007, WWE.com challenged [[fans]] to vote for the greatest RAW match of all time.  The "official" winner was Shawn Michaels vs John Cena in an hour long match, but the ACTUAL winner according to votes was this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNKHiZQ7NXQ WWF match from June 2001] with Chris Benoit.  

This is further proof that:

1. WWE did Benoit<br>
2. The World Wildlife Fund's initials still draw more attention than the present product<br>
and<br>
3. Fans would rather honor a talented child murderer than a [[John Cena|homosexual]]

===What really happened===
[[Image:Anguished_benoit.jpg|thumb|Benoit, in yarmulke, unmistakable proof that Jews did Benoit]] 

June 26, 2007. The Benoit family were going about their lives. Little did they know that the [[Zionist]] scourge was using the very fabric of their existence in an effort to pursue power in their next [[politics|political]] take-over.  300,000 [[Jews]] who lived in Benoit's neighborhood were absent at the time of the murder. <big>'''Coincidence?'''</big>

[[JEWS DID WTC|JEWS DID BENOIT]]

It has long been speculated that Benoit was an accomplice in the Jew's attack on [[WTC]].  Experts agree that the Jews killed Chris to cover up his whereabouts on the morning of [[9/11|September 11, 2001]]:

The family of the bitch/wife/whore that got killed are (surprise!) wanting your monies! But they don't want no shitty gifts or condolences, they want large tax dollar donations of at least [[over 9000]] to be made to their foundation. It's totally for kids and bitches who got raped and beaten but not killed, and they totally won't use it to buy themselves steroids, [[hookers and blow]] or the next WWE Pay Per View. It's called The Nancy and Daniel Benoit Foundation for Battered Women and Abused Children, which is [[TL;DR]]. Anyway, send any shit you can spare to:

==Benoit, meet the [[internets]]==

===Pwning Wrestlecrap===
As most people familiar with the [[retards|wrestling fan]] website wrestlecrap know, talking shit about any dead wrestler (regardless if they [[pwned]] their wife and kid) on their forums is considered [[Anti-lulz]] and grounds for you being banned [[in the ass]]! Almost every other [[wrestling]] forum on the [[internets]] will do the same to you as well and you will be banned for [[at least 100 years]]. According to [[faggots|wrestling fans]], pwning your wife and child is forgivable if you were really good at  making an amiable career of suplexing some other half-naked [[rednecks]] really hard on a regular basis.

===Trolling Benoit Fans on MySpace for Fun and Profit===
Tragic death, MySpace, and [[gay|wrestling]] [[Retards|fanbois]] make for the perfect storm of lulz.  Needless to say, much [[butthurt]] and poor comprehension of the English language ensues.

Just remember what you're doing when you fuck with Benoit apologists, or you may end up being the one getting trolled. The excuses, demands he still posthumously be put in the WWE Hall Of Fame (that would be a BRILLIANT idea and have no backlash whatsoever... wait, one of their pay per views is Backlash.... I smell an angle!) and etc will legitimately piss you off. That is, of course, unless you're reading this article, in which case you're too far gone to really get upset about anything.

==Trivia==
[[Image:Killer_Krossface.jpg|thumb|The crippler crossface in action]]

*Chris Benoit loved his fans, but hated his wife and son to death.
*Benoit is french for ''"i'm gonna strangle you"''
*Chris is stranglin' the angels now. [[No|We'll miss you Chris.]]
*Chris killed his son using the patented [[Stick it in her pooper|Crippler Crossface!]]

==The Fresh Chris of Hell Queer==
[[Image:Wifekiller6.jpg|thumb|Death has never been so [[profit|profitable]]!]]

<blockquote>Now this is the story all about how <br>
My life got flipped-turned upside down <br>
And I'd like to take a minute to talk off-stage<br>
And tell you how I became the victim of a thing called roid-rage.<br>

In the pro wrestling industry, born and raised,<br>
Choking other men is how I spent most of my days.<br>
Headbuttin', cross-facin', as a technical king,<br>
All while shootin' some steroids outside of the ring.<br>
When I got an iPhone, I was up to no good.<br>
Skipped a match and flew back to my neighborhood.<br>
I took one too many roids, my wife gasped for breath,<br>
I said "Stop moving your little ass while I choke you to death!"<br>

I whistled for my son and when he came near,<br>
He still had "Fragile-X" and the physique of a queer.<br>
If anything I could say that this kid was rare,<br>
But I thought "Nah, forget it" and deprived him of air!<br>

I went down to the gym around 7 or 8,<br>
And I yelled to myself "Yo Chris, smell ya latah!"<br>
Hung myself to death, at a very young age,<br>
Now I'm burning in hell, all because of roid-rage.<br>
