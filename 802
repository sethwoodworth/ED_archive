Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense
'''Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense''' or '''BJOMGWTFBBQAODN''' is a [[TL;DR]] page on [[Wikipedia]] where Wikipedians try [[erection|very hard]] to [[unfunny|prove they have a sense of humour]]. This page makes no sense for a number of reasons:

#[[Wikipedophiles|Wikipedians]] have no sense of humor.
#The title makes it known that the jokes they are finding are bad, yet they are the only [[shit|jokes on Wikipedia]].
#If you like humour so much, why are you deleting it?
#Why make the obvious assertion that jokes are nonsense, dummy?
#They call themselves Wikipedians.
#Wikipedians have no sense of humour
#This list is very British.

Spending any significant amount of time at BJAODN is [[srsly]] hazardous to your lulz, and may cause you to laugh like {{audio|Wikilaugh.mp3|this.}}

==Original Research==
The first BJOMGWTFBBQAODN edit that still exists within Wikipedia edit history ([[your mom|see below]]) strangely enough contains an actual joke on the concept of '''logical positivism'''. This is hysterical to [[User:ParkingStones|Dr. ParkingStones]] as he is the only person in the whole of the known universe who would ever find such a joke [[funny]].

The joke follows:

:Logical positivism asserts that only statements about empirical observations are meaningful, effectively asserting that all metaphysical statements are meaningless.

:Unfortunately, this fundamental tenet of logical positivism belongs to the family of statements that it asserts to be meaningless. As a result, the entire edifice of logical positivism vanishes in a puff of logic.

:This insight appears not to have occurred to the logical positivist school of philosophers.

A link on the front of the current page leads to a page called [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:List_of_really_really_stupid_article_ideas_that_you_should_not_create|Wikipedia:List of really really stupid article ideas that you should not create]] and contained the following box which looked like a template. This box would be funny if it were, y'know, [[funny]] &mdash; but it's not. 
<div class="boilerplate metadata" id="disclaimer" style="text-align: justify; background: #f0f0f0; margin: .5em 2%; padding: 0 1em; border: 1px solid #000"> This article is intended as humor. If you have been sent here by another user after creating an article that might qualify on the following list, you may safely tell them that they sent you to the wrong  ''<nowiki>[</nowiki>insert curse word or words of choice here<nowiki>]</nowiki>'' place. The place she/he/it probably '''''wanted''''' to send you was to Wikipedia:List of bad article ideas.</div>

The page was obviously marked as [[VFD]] by a Wikirobotian operation on Neutral. The page was saved but people actually voted to delete because it was irredeemably POV. Idiots. (For the VFD Page, [[User:Quasidan|See Below]].)

*No, it isn't that [[funny]] to anybody except [[you]]. That is what [[Uncyclopedia]] is for.
*Anything about which you cannot be [[buttsecks|buggered]] to write one complete sent
*It basically shoots cum out of it, and [[girls]] eat it, and then screams of pleasure, and jail bait, and getting banged in [[jail]], and dying with it erect! WOODY!.
