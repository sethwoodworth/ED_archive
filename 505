Animu archetypes
This is a list of the typical character archetypes in [[anime]]. All characters on all the [[animu]] fit into one of these. Every. Single. One. Which goes to show you that outside of schoolgirls being raped by tentacles, the Japanese are actually pretty uncreative.

==The Whiny Main Character (WMC)==
The Whiny Main Character is just that, a pathetic twat who whines constantly about ''everything'' throughout whatever fruity magical adventure they're on. They only actually do anything if at least three other characters are in mortal danger and have spent the last five minutes yelling their name. This archetype was probably meant for nerds to [[Mary Sue|put their faces on]] so they can pretend they're the one getting [[BDSM|beat up]] by the Strong Independent Chick (who always secretly loves them, no matter how much of a fuck-up they are). Nearly every animu has a WMC because Japanese males hate the fact their [[penis]]es are so small, and they express their impotent rage by [[otakukin|projecting themselves onto the character]].  Most WMCs are, of course, male, but can be female, such as in the case of ''Gunbuster''. Other typical characteristics are that they eat more food in one sitting than all of Africa eats in a year; when faced with a threat they become suddenly [[fangirl|"brave," "cocky," and "gallant]]." This archetype is blissfully [[retard|naïve]] and [[gay|always enjoys a challenge]].

===Notable Whiny Characters===

Image:Edward-elric-fammy.jpg|[[Fullmetal Alchemist|Edward Elric]] can't stop whining about his robot brother or some such shit.
</gallery>
|}}

==Strong Independent Chick (SIC)==
This chick's one and only purpose is usually to bean guys over the head with mallets if they suggest a date or sex with anything for any reason.  [[Fanboy]]s laugh their asses off when this happens, but intelligent people will say [[Unfunny|"That wasn't funny."]]  This character will most likely fall in love with the main character for [[slut|some reason]], no matter how [[shemale|whiny his voice is]]. She will always express her love with extra abuse. She'll also prevent the Pervert from getting any tang round here. Nearly all [[fanservice]] is of these characters. Not to be confused with the Introvert.

===Notable Strong Independent Chicks===
{{cg|Gallery|StrongExample|center|<gallery>
Image:Onepiecehentai2.jpg|Nami from ''[[One Piece]]'' wearing a two piece!

===Minor Strong Independent Chicks===
*[[Wapanese|Weeaboo fangirls]] (they wish)

==The Pervert (PERV)==
This guy will usually steal and/or try to look at girls' panties, for that oh-so-necessary [[pantyshot]]. These characters are meant to portray the [[pedophile|average Japanese male]].  [[Kawaii]]. ^_________________^

Groping of breasts is also required of this guy. They get kicked in the nuts by the Strong Independent Chick most often, usually after copping a feel from them. Most characters like this are sniveling man-children who can't even think about a pair of breasts without losing a pint of blood.

===Notable Perverts===
{{cg|Gallery|PervertExample|center|<gallery>
Image:Lum-and-ataru.jpg|Ataru from ''Urusei Yatsura'', the original anime pervert who started the trend.

===Minor Perverts===
* Every adult male in [[Japan]] and everyone on [[7chan]].
* [[Chris-chan]].

==Small Annoying Thing (SAT)==
No series of Annie May can get the okay without having one of these little shits around. Superduperextradeluxe [[kawaii|KAWAII!!!!1111]] and easily marketed, every single one has some kind of [[plastic crap]] in its likeness. They usually can't talk, but if they can, they give advice to the WMC or talk exactly like infants. They all have some dumb gimmick like being [[fatty|obsessed with desserts]], or burrowing into the digestive tract of the SIC, triggering an ever-popular colonoscopy episode. [[TL;DR|Sometimes these are human, making them more annoying and a little creepy, due to the fact that if they are human, they tend to walk around on all fours at least half of the time and, since they can talk, the creators usually give them painfully high-pitched voices]]. The Beautiful Airhead is of course drawn to these things.

===Notable Small Annoying Things===

*Mieu the Cheagle, though it is fun to watch him get beat up by [[Fag|Luke]].
*The [[Spaction3|Noid]]
*Every catgirl EVAR!!1!
*Your [[penis]]
*Your [[Dickgirl|mom's penis]]
*[[You]]
*Kon from ''[[Bleach]]''

==The Pissed Off Guy (POG)==
The Pissed Off Guy is there to look [[RAGE|angry]]. Due to the limitations of the anime drawing style, however, he usually ends up looking constipated. This guy is [[Internet tough guy|always angry]], and doesn't care about anything besides fighting or his hair, but is actually always a complete wuss, even compared to the SAT. Usually ends up getting his ass kicked until The Whiny Main Character comes in and saves him with some kind of [[l33t]] power/spell/gun. If he was real, you would be sure he'd have a Myspace and be a [[camwhore]] or [[internet tough guy]]. 99% of all [[slash]] is between these and WMCs.

===Notable Pissed Off Guys===
{{cg|Gallery|PissOffExample|center|<gallery>
Image:KaibaFruit.jpg|[[Seto-Kaiba.com|Kaiba]] from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh]]''... apparently he's really rich but [[Failure|still can't get laid]].

===Minor Pissed Off Guys===
*Possibly everyone else from ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''.
*Every male character in ''[[Shit nobody cares about|Bleach]]''.
*[[Darth Vader|Kratos]] from ''Tales of Symphonia'', because he's always berating [[Retard|Lloyd]] and bitching about [[Mary Sue|Anna]].

==The Grim Angsty Guy ([[Blowjob|GAG]])==
There's much overlap between this category and the one immediately preceding it; the difference lies in the tendency of this bunch to turn their angst inward, resulting in reams of boring introspection, monosyllabic speech patterns, and often figurative - though sometimes literal - self-destruction. As well as anime, many video game characters [[Final Fantasy VII|exemplify]] [[Final Fantasy VIII|this]] [[Castlevania|archetype]].

Image:Alphonse elric fullmetal alchemist.jpg|[[Fullmetal Alchemist|Alphonse Elric]] is sad because his cock is in another dimension.
</gallery></center>

==The Beautiful Airhead (BA)==
Usually female, the Airhead serves no other purpose other than to stand there and look stupid while a stiff wind blows up her skirt, so we can all see her [[kawaii]] panties. She can also be used to distract WMC from the SIC, creating a [[unfunny|hilarious misunderstanding]]. Clothes are an alien concept to the Airhead, as she can never seem to keep them on. Her hobbies include [[rape|bending over countertops]], hanging around practically naked, screaming at pitches high enough to shatter glass, eating frosting, and watching her clothes fall off with a blank expression.

===Notable Beautiful Airheads===

</gallery>
|}}

==The Introvert ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator INFP])==
This character is '''always''' a girl. She starts off meek and introverted but from the WMC's bravery she learns to [[Mary Sue|"be herself"]]; that is, completely change her personality and traits. Her hair is always [[emo|dark purple with long bangs]]. [[stalker|Will always spy on the WMC]]. With the [[Bukkake|liberal application of testosterone]], she evolves into a Strong Independent Chick.

===Notable Introverts===

</gallery>
|}}

==The Batshit Insane Guy (BIG)==
This character [[Libertarianism|has no grip on reality]]. [[fantard|Rarely doing anything constructive]] and generally confusing the hell out of everyone, the BIG is capable of [[divide by zero|anything and everything]] that makes no sense at all. Notable for their powers to store insane amounts of large, random objects up their [[ass]] for use when the world is in danger. The BIG often transforms into a Pissed Off Guy when someone points out how crazy they really are.

===Notable Batshit Insane Guys===
{{cg|Gallery|BatShitExample|center|<gallery>
Image:PegasusAv1.jpg|Maximilian Pegasus of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh]]''. Rich [[Furry|furfaggot]], designer and player of children's card games, and occasional soul thief.

===Minor Batshit Insane Guys===
* Everyone from ''[[Higurashi]]'' [[Spoiler|when those parasites take control of them]].
* Almost everyone else from ''Bobobo''-bobo-bobo.

==The Annoying Perfectionist (AP)==
These guys are a little hard to find, but they are still out there. These characters have ''serious'' [[e-psychiatrist|OCPD]]. If one little thing is out of place or order, they will ALWAYS scream at the top of their lungs about how imperfect the thing is and try to fix it. It does not matter what dire situation the other characters are in, and because of this, the AP usually holds the characters back from whatever their current goal is. However, if they can't fix whatever is not perfect, they start feeling suicidal and in some cases they literally try to kill themselves. Unfortunately they usually fail. Their attitude and antics are usually an unfunny running gag throughout whatever series they are in.

===Notable Annoying Perfectionists===
<center><gallery>
Image:Deaththekid.png|Death the Kid from ''Soul Eater''. One of the most annoying APs out there.
Image:Chirikitsu.png|Chiri Kitsu from ''Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei''. Maybe this doesn't count since she's technically a parody of this archetype.
Image:Mikamiterudeathnote.jpg|Teru Mikami from ''[[Death Note]]''; his [[OCD]] wound up fucking over everything for his [[BDSM|master]], [[God|Light]].
</gallery></center>

==The Convenient Prodigy ([[CP]])==
Usually, this character can whip up whatever you happen to need whenever you happen to need it. A new robot arm? An interdimensional gate? A gun bigger than the planet? None of these are a problem. Alternatively, this character is a misunderstood genius who always [[Obvious|wonders]] why everyone thinks he/she is so weird. Mostly, these freaks are around as ''[[Latin|dei ex machina]]'' who are employed to usefully explain the inexplicable.

===Notable Convenient Prodigies===

|}}

==The Macho Guy (MG)==
Although not as hard to find as an AP, these guys are still uncommon, because most of the time, these guys just barely miss the POG and/or the BIG archetype. Unlike all the other annoying archetypes, this guy is somewhat likable. This is because, whenever there is a problem, [[Gurren Lagann|this guy kicks reason to the curb]] and solves everything with [[brute force]] while laughing his ass off in the process. When this happens, he often destroys most of the scenery around him in the process. Because of this, the other archetypes are often scared to death of this guy. Due to their manliness, they are often parodied in woman's clothing. [[You]] will never be as manly as this guy.

===Notable Macho Guy===

<center>[[Image:Kenchargin.jpg]]</center>
<center>'''YES HE WILL FUCKING DESTROY YOU.'''</center>

===Pussies That are Almost MGs but Fall Short===
*A lot of the main characters from ''[[Gurren Lagann]]''. <del>WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK THEY ARE!?</del> Shitty overrated animu characters.
*Most of the main characters from ''[[DBZ]]''.
*Major Armstrong from ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]''.
*Kenpachi Zaraki from ''[[Bleach]]''.
*Not Chuck Norris.

==The Ambiguously Gay Guy (AGG)==
The exact opposite of the MG. Generally, the only reason they're considered guys is because they [[shemale|have penises]]. Also known as "[[Bishounen|bishies]]," they dress pretty like all the Japanese male idols, because Japan thinks that's [[irony|manly]]. They tend to cross over with other archetypes, typically the WMC or on occasions, the Pervert. If they are neither, they'll probably just be a [[douche]]. Despite their ambiguously gay appearance, they are usually asexual or straight, depending on the main character's gender. They are guaranteed to have tons of [[fangirl]]s who write [[fanfiction]]s featuring them and another AGG having [[buttsecks]].

</center>

==The Trap==
A once rare commodity, now located in the bargain section. Like the AGG, they look gay. Unlike the AGG, they '''are''' gay. They are [[at least 100]] times girlier than the girliest girl in the show. Their ultimate wish is to have his [[asking for it|ass plowed]] by the main character. It's supposed to be hard to tell they're guys, but ironically, it's usually completely obvious from the start. As far as personality goes, just take a generic female character and attach a penis onto it. Yeah, having a penis is a personality trait that makes for deep characters.

It is a common fact that they have a much smaller fanbase of girls than [[fanboy|boys]], because they're made to appeal to [[fag|closet homos]] who draw comics of them sucking off [[Kevin Smith|37]] faceless dudes' dicks in a row while being fucked in the ass by guys who haven't the common courtesy to give them a reacharound.

===Notable Traps===

Image:Ranma12.GIF|[[Ranma 1/2|Ranma]], [[Transsexual|pre-op and post-op]].
</gallery>
</center>

==The Lesbian==
This is an archetype that is usually split into two groups, A and B. One of these girls are usually found in an anime/manga where the main character, or even one of the main characters, is a girl, and sometimes in harems. If there isn't a girl who is a main character, they are usually so subtle about their preference that a lot of people do not notice. This is because the lesbian is a dyke who pretends to be the main character's friend, just so they can get in bed with her someday. She is usually subtle about this, but this is subtle by anime standards, and half the time she fondles the main characters breasts and says "good things" about her. The main character usually tells her to stop, but she doesn't think too much about it and stays friends with the lesbian because she's obviously a fucking moron. If the lesbian isn't this way, she is a group B lesbian, and she often goes through these "hilarious" sequences where she questions if she likes her best friend in "that way" or not. These sequences are often followed up by even more "hilarious" bits where she encounters her friend nude, much to her shock.

===Notable Lesbians===
{{cg|Gallery|NLesbiansExample|center|<gallery>
Image:Chizuru.jpg|Chizuru Honshō from ''Bleach'' (Group A). A true lesbian patron. She will spring on Orihime and feel her boobs whenever she gets the chance.
Image:Tomoyo.jpg|Tomoyo from [[Cardcaptor Sakura]] (Group A). Don't let her age and personality fool you; she is a HUGE lesbian, and she fantasizes about the day she will finally get in bed with Sakura.
Image:Setsuna.jpg|Setsuna Sakurazaki from ''Mahou Sensei Negima'' (Group B). Also an Introvert. Much to her dismay, she has the hawts for her best friend Konoka.

Image:Tsukasathewavemaster.jpg|Tsukasa from ''[[hack|.hack//SIGN]]'' (Group B). He's actually a girl, who happens to be a lesbian, and also a whiny [[emo]] bitch. Although more of a WMC, this character still fits this archetype.
Image:Kaorin.jpg|Kaorin from ''Azumanga Daioh'' (Group A). If anyone gets in the way of her crush on Sakaki, she will transform into a BIG and beat the living shit out of them.
Image:Sailormoonharukamichiru.jpg|Haruka and Michiru from [[Sailor Moon]] (Group A). Different in that they already have each other to boink and they spend all their non-hanky-panky talking about [[Fact|how worthless the world and especially Usagi are]], but it's painfully obvious they wanted to gang-[[rape]] her.

===Minor Lesbians===
