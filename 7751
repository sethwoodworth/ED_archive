Sporcle

'''[http://www.sporcle.com/ Sporcle]''' is a site where the masses of the internet can go to play [[quiz]]zes and other online [[games]] testing their knowledge of [[fact]]s about [[over 9000]] different types of [[shit nobody cares about]]. It is kinda like an internet version of Family Fortunes (Family Feud for [[Americunts]]).

==Content==
The site is a great way to waste time, and lose your [[motivation]] in life to get on with whatever you were doing for about a day. It's also great if you are [[depressed]], considering [[suicide]] or doing the next [[school shooting]] as its mind-expanding distractions might make you [[FGM|feel good]] about yourself, as you'll uncover hidden knowledge that you didn't know you even had. Either that, or you've been spending far too much time on [[Wikipedia]] so that you know all the answers to your specialist subjects anyway.

The entire website is very [[US]]-centric. It also contains a bunch of whining [[Britfag]]s who complain about this. As for the rest of the world, they either put up with it or [[nobody cares]].

Most of the people who use it are politically-correct liberal faggots who will [[baw|bawwwww]] if you say something that is out of line in the comments, or make a joke that doesn't suck the cock of third world military regimes in one of the geography quizzes.

==How it works==
[[Image:Pokemonguessaf2.jpg|thumb|[[WTF]], you didn't get [[Seaking]]? [http://www.sporcle.com/games/pokemon.php Maybe you can].]]
Basically, you type in the answers to the questions. It is commonly [[rage|fucking annoying]] when you have the right answer but due to its [[gay|pedantry]], it won't accept your spelling. Also annoying is on the geography quizzes where all your answers clutter the screen and you can't even see which fucking ones you've answered and which you've not.

There is a time limit, and at the end you can see how well others have done, and whether you have a [[nerd]]y level of knowledge of that subject or not. It is assumed that you're not going to cheat by using [[Wikipedia]], because that would ruin the whole purpose of it (and Wikipedia ruins every educational curriculum, [[evar]], even those of [[university]] PhD students).

The comments section contains [[spoiler]]s and people are always like "[[baw|oh why did I not think of that first!!!!]][[111|111oneoneone]]."

In the [[future]], Sporcle plans to let users create their own games. The day when there is a [[memes]] quiz is on the horizon, although due to the [[censorship]] (you can't even say [[fuck]] on Sporcle without them bowdlerizing it) there'll probably be no room for including [[goatse]] or [[1guy1jar]]. Doubtless [[Boxxy]], [[rickrolling]] and [[lolcats]] will be there though.
