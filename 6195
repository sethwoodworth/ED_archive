<br>Six anons went out protest the church. Low numbers, but well supplied and high morale. Literature was distributed and signs were raised eliciting honks from quite a few motorists, some buses, and one epic fire engine. In a move that bodes very poorly for the million year war for earth the $cilons locked up their island fortress and wouldn't let anybody in. Anon had a fun time waiting for them to poke their heads out and waving at them until they retreated back inside. Scientology was soundly routed and Oahufags would like to inform our Marcabian overlords that our volcano is still fully operational and awaiting more DC10s. Aloha Xenu!

Fantastic fucking excellent time, high energy, tons of car-honks, good times. Lawrence Wollersheim (won $9 million by suing the cult) and [[Jason Beghe]] were there.

<br>We are an efficient machine. In essence, Portland gets down to business when people are protesting. While we need more lulz, Gwen Barnard-Mayfield (DSA for OSA) came out and gave us all candy before retreating inside. Also, we had a freaking partyvan show up out of nowhere and tell us how Scientologists ripped him off. I love Portland. [http://wweek.com/wwire/?p=11867 We made the front page] of the [http://wweek.com/ Willamette Week website] and we are gaining media attention.
