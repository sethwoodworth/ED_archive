''Would you - outside of this interview - use the word "furry" to describe your own art?

''Furry, only in the sense of visual art, yes, though I would not describe myself as one who is a 'furry'. I like the art, and I believe I am good at drawing it, '''but a furry I am not.'''''-- [http://www.crushyiffdestroy.com/show/bernal Bernal in denial]

Jeremy Bernal is a self-important [[Traced|trace artist]] who spends his free time sucking [[cum|money]] out of the [[penis|pockets]] of gullible basement-dwelling [[furries]] with his over-protected website, [http://www.sexyfur.com/ SexyFur].  

According to Sexyfur "all models are over 18", which is simple considering that he uses one model for EVERYTHING. That's right- every single abomination on that site is simply a trace of the same damned girl with a random animal head, some poorly-drawn muscles and some photoshop effects thrown on. Don't believe us? Check out the gallery. Apparently furries are too stupid to notice that every single picture is of the same girl. 

Making it worse, every drawing is actually a trace of a digital photograph previously taken with poorly-done shading and some photoshop effects tossed on to try to hide it. Yes, [[retards|furries]] are paying for flat-faced, badly-drawn tracings of a real girl who probably isn't all that hot anymore considering how long Sexyfur has been gobbling [[cock|money]] up.

Catching on that Sexyfur is a total rippoff, [[Sibe]], [[Shii]], and [[Nathanr]] posted his pictures of [[The Kadaitcha Dancers|Fine Furry Art]] for free, interrupting his supply of the [[furry]] equivalent of [[hookers and blow]]. But no, he was not content to just angst and whine like a normal furry when someone posted his poorly-drawn art without his permission! To protect his [[Five-penised cows|intellectual property]], he issued [[DMCA]] notices to sites like WTFux, WTFur, [[4chan]], [[7chan]], and the [[The Russian LJ Abuse Conspiracy]] for posting his "copyrighted [[bullshit|artwork]]". 

Bernal [[BAWW]]ed about not making money off his poorly-made smut, and tried to turn most of Furrydom against those who spread his art for free. A few [[retards]] jumped on the [[cock|bandwagon]] and began riding furiously, but most people don't give a fuck as free porn is always better than porn you have to pay for, especially when the quality is as shitty as Bernal's art is. To this day the rest of the internet sees Bernal as a whiny blowhard who really needs to learn how to [[shop]] better, or at least stop tracing the same girl over and over again, marking it as "new weekly art". 

===Comments from the furries=== 
[[Image:Bernalhorse.png|thumb|150px| left]]


1.Ears do not grow from the back of the skull. They are concave, not solid cones.

2.Horses do not have large oval cheek ruffs that extend out several inches from the face, yet also appear to be behind the mane, which on an equine, runs down the centre-line of the neck.

3.Hair does not normally grow in a closed loop. A horse's mane also does not commonly grow out of one ear.

4.This is a nicely drawn mouth for an anteater. Not so much for a horse.

5.You seem to have drawn two necks and forgotten which one you’re using. Pro-tip, one head, one neck. Also someone seems to have broken this character’s neck and left it at an odd, dislocated angle. This may explain the expression of comatose slackness.

''Pinkuh Wrote: Hell I worked for them and they tried to push me around, rejected perfectly good art, and in general went around being ass hats.''

''Octan: Didn't she (pinkuh) just start working for them like a month ago or so? Seem to remember it being mentioned somewheres. Talk about a fast turnaround.''
