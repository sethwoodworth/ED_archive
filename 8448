Toki Pona
[[Image:Sonjaelenkisa-tokipona.jpg|thumb|She is ugly, therefore not worth listening to, unless she gets a teaching position and your grade depends on it, gender studies student.  Have fun working at BK with that degree.]]

'''Toki Pona''' is a [[bullshit|constructed]] language created by the [[French]] [[Canadian]] [[lesbian]] [[Wikipedo]] Sonja Elen Kisa. As with [[Esperanto]], Toki Pona [[cultural appropriation|borrows heavily]] from the languages it is constructed from. It is also really [[Simple Wikipedia|easy to learn]], making it the perfect language for [[retard]]s to learn. She also wants to control their minds through Toki Pona, because of its fitting in with the [[shit nobody cares about|Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis]] and [[1984|George Orwell]]'s ideas of "[[newfag|newspeak]]" and "[[duckroll|duckspeak]]".

Unlike most other Internets conlangs, Toki Pona is in fact so [[notable]] that it has [[wikipedia:Toki Pona|its own article]] on Wikipedia. This is probably due to her [[slut|flaunting]] her language, which has increased the number of [[Google]] hits on her, leading to her having [[USI]], because we all know that Wikipedia [[lie|always]] [http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&word1=LOL+WUT&word2=Sonja+Elen+Kisa chooses] what articles it has based on the number of Google hits they get.

Sonja [[shemale|herself]] is about 30 years old, has a girlfriend and is a [[pot]] smoker, as well as being [[LaraLove|alcohol-free]]. She also enjoys chess and other, lesser board games, [[Family Guy]] and listening to [[Hipster|Squarepusher and Autechre]]. She maintains a [[LiveJournal]], which can be found [http://sonjaaa.livejournal.com/profile here].

{{quote|I [[BAWWWWW|don't tolerate]] [[discrimination]] and [[reality|negativity]] very well, e.g. [[homophobia]], [[racism]], [[bi]]phobia, [[trap|transphobia]]. Life can be a challenge for many of us, but we [[dogma|must always strive]] to be on a positive and constructive path.}}

Like a typical stoned liberal arts academic, she's [[batshit crazy|away with the fairies]] and has no idea about the real world.

It is said that [[Sceptre]] was also caught [[fapping]] to a pic of her [[Last Thursday]], but [[nobody gives a fuck]].
