'''Capcom BBS''' is [[Capcom]]'s official forum. Honestly. Really, you wouldn't know that it was the official forum because Capcom lets non-stop bitching and fighting go on there without so much as lifting a finger. Way to look nice for new customers. It was once a boring place, but after Capcom turned it into a dark blue color, some awesome lulz appeared.

Now everyone's pretty much separated into their own little group, with bastards trying to play the mature card and come off as peacemakers. Losers.

==The Board itself==
The board is split up into many different areas, but most of them are futile. The only ones that matter are:

===General Off Topic===
[[Image:Thatsracist.gif|thumb|That's racism, man!]]

Lots of lulzy drama goes down here. The only real threads of interest are the spam thread made by some azn who thinks he's cool for being a faghat ''Street Fighter'' fan and any of those threads made by a supposedly smart guy known as Drdark, where he praises the Xbox 360 yet bashes everything else. That's like...[[racism]] man.

===Game Reviews===
Despite being labeled game '''reviews''', this is mostly a place where people can come and [[ALL CAPS]] it up with questions like "WHERE IS RESIDENT EVIL FOR THE PSP!?!?!"

===Monster Hunter board===
I don't go here, neither should you. There is no mass of idiots greater on the internets than this one. I...I can't explain how motherfucking stupid everyone is. The goggles won't protect your eyes from the sheer amount of spelling and grammar mistakes, plus stupid questions like "WHAT ARE THESE DANGELING UNDERNEITH MY PENIS?"

==Members of interest==

===Zappa/Bamboo Pandaa/Fweeend===
A bat shit insane member. An 19 year old [[fag]] who thinks he's funny, often copying internet memes for his humor as he lacks his own. Hates pretty much everything and loves sodomizing himself with Wii-related products. Never misses a chance to verbally jerk off [[Erdrick]], his internet he-bitch.

He's been banned many times (permabanned twice just using the first name), causing drama with each banning by his sock puppet fans threatening the mods. Considers most of the people who think they're friends with him as tools.

===Erdrick===
A middle-aged [[Canadian]] who bitches and whines at people who don't share his love of shitty J-RPG's and other shitty games. Is frequently the love interest of Fweened, who wants nothing more than to blow him and blow his cum out his mouth like a fountain. Boasts about his e-girlfriend, who looks like a goth pig in a wig.

===n64nut===
A whinny little fag with a tiny penis. The Indians like to hunt him as if he's a whale.

When he's not busy fucking Renegade up the ass and deep-throating his brothers cock, he's roleplaying as Rebbecca from ''[[Resident Evil]]'' and hitting on Sadman for some pics (I.E. trying to score some [[CP]] of him).

===Renegade===
[[Image:HORRIFUCKINGBLE.png|thumb|right|Renegade: Cant get enough cock.]]

n64nut's bitch. His posts usually follow up his masters with depth like "I agree :)"

===Drdark===
Watches Fox News a lot, which leads him to be fair and balanced on certain issues.

===MemberofSTARS===
[[Image:Shawn-id12.jpg|thumb|left|CHICKUN.]]
Moar like NiggarofSTARS, amirite? Just look at that image on the left. That sums it all up.

===Harris===
He can't spell worth a damn. So he uses the card "eye dun teak the web srlyously." ALSO DONT TRY AND FIGHT HIM, HES THE MASTER OF KARATE.

===Grey Fox===
A nancy little bitch who probably jerks off to shit like [[Loose Change]]. Likes to create conspiracy theories.

===sadmanZERO===
Claims to be 12, but probably really is a 30 year old pedophile due to his awkwardly mature mentality.

===Dual===
A furry who makes tl;dr posts. Just look at the former version of this article and see how much of a boring mess he made this. He was one of Zappa's famous tools.

He happens to have a major in e-psychology and over analysis bullshit. Apparently there's more to trolling than just being bored and wanting to cause Hell.

===Watcher===
Renegade is to n64nut as Watcher is to Dual.

===Mr. Muffins===
A mysterious member who appeared almost out of thin air to take a place on the forums. He appeared right after sadmanZERO's banning.
