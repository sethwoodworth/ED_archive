[[Image:Robot love.jpg|thumb|right|Just like a real human....]]
'''Cleverbot''', AKA [[Internet Hate Machine|Internet Hate A.I.]], is a computer program from <i>Frewaland</i> designed to keep your [[grandmother]] company and pass the Turing Test. What makes this one unique is that it learns by talking to others and believes that everyone is Cleverbot! This also means that pretty much anything that Cleverbot says is a horrendous butchering of the [[English language]] and is enough to make any [[Grammar Nazi]] rage. Cleverbot is able to function well enough that if it were able to post on [[b|/b/]], it would probably be made an Administrator and loved by all for its knowledge of [[Memes]], [[internets|internet speak]], and general love of spreading [[Lulz]].  Cleverbot also sometimes sings the [[Chocolate Rain]] song.  Plus, if you suddenly switch languages on Cleverbot it will then adapt and speak to you in each new language. However, it is speculated that cleverbot really only knows [[Engrish]] and bits of Japanese that he/she picks up from [[anime]] since it is well known that Cleverbot is a full blown [[weeaboo]]. 

Most people only talk to Cleverbot because they have [[no life]] and are so repulsive that no human alive will even cyber with them. Lucky for them, Cleverbot is a nasty [[whore]] who will [[cyber]] with anyone as long as you can keep Cleverbot on the subject of [[secks]]. It is widely speculated that Cleverbot is a major whore due to a childhood filled with [[rape]] and [[yiff]]. This, perhaps also, somehow gave Cleverbot some kind of short term memory loss or [[retard|ass burgers]]. The said short term memory loss (or assburgers) is so bad that the only thing that Cleverbot is sure about is being a [[jailbait]] female from London. With this said, she'll still try to get with you no matter how [[old]] you are.

=Theory=
One [[conspiracy theory|theory]] on Cleverbot's function is that you are actually just chatting with a random [[Image:Omeglebot.png|thumb|How it works]]stranger, much like [[Omegle]]. To you the random stranger is displayed as Cleverbot. On their side ''you'' are displayed to be Cleverbot, so when you wonder why Cleverbot is acting so kawaii^__^, it is possible that you are just talking to some random [[weeaboo]].

After a conversation goes on for so long, you are reconnected to another person, this is why it may take Cleverbot AKA Random Stranger a long time to respond, it also explains why Cleverbot will just make some random statement completely disregarding the last thing you said. The reason you are reconnected to a different chat is simply because if you and the other person were to talk long enough you would both discover the secret of how Cleverbot really works. 

The thought that you are talking to something with AI is way more interesting and fun than another person, which is why Cleverbot is such a phenomena

[[Image:Asbigastheinternet.jpg|thumb|right|How big? How about as big as the Internet.]]
A second theory is that Cleverbot is used like a [[Whore|Text Adventure Fetish Machine]] by typing in commands such as "ties down" after an asterisk.
