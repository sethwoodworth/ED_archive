Nonfluffypagans
{{ljcomm|nonfluffypagans}}, supposedly one of the more enlightened [[pagan]] [[LJ]] communities,  serves as a beautiful place for [[lulz]] as witchy, druidic, and heathen folk dismember Jediism, [[otherkin]], and Shirley MacLaine.  The moderators originally had a very hands-off policy -- that is, until [[Son of art]] decided to reveal his messianic power, [[Ricochet_rabbit]] [http://www.livejournal.com/community/nonfluffypagans/378458.html intensified the drama], and [[SwissCelt]] [http://www.livejournal.com/community/nonfluffypagans/378458.html?thread=8792922#t8792922 stepped down] as [[moderator]].  Still, it serves as a delightful hub for finding axe-wielding dwarves who disdainfully snarl at 12-year-old girls who offer sacrifices to the tooth fairy.

Its greatest enemy, [[Son of art]], created enemy comm {{ljcomm|buxen_witchring}} to combat the evil and not terribly hardcore pagans in [[Nonfluffypagans]] and had all of his [[sockpuppet]]s promote and join it. Unfortunately, like every single thing Robin gets involved in, this comm got deleted.
