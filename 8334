The Way of the Master
{{needsmoar|about the finances of WOTM.}}

[[Image:WOTB.jpg |thumb|right| Because religion isn't enough of a scam already.]]

<big>'''''The Way of the Master (WOTM)'''''</big> is a [[Americunt]]-based [[Christian]] and [[Creationism]] evangelism ministry, founded in 2002 and headed by washed-up child actor Kirk Cameron, New Zealand-born snake-oil salesman Ray Comfort and religious side-show freak Todd Friel. The organization includes a TV show, radio broadcast, books, online school, small-group training courses, and a website.

Yes, they are professional [[Christfags]] and therefore [[lolcows]]. Using the most retarded arguments to prove their claims, and willing to lower themselves to any depth in order to gain [[fantards]] that will take part in their religious pyramid scheme.

'''What that Jesus-flavored infomercial is about...'''

=='''Core Beliefs'''==
===<u>'''Christianity [[Christian|(see main article)]]'''</u>===
They adhere to that wonderful conundrum that is full of mindless, brainwashed followers who spend their entire life in misery when they aren't spreading the [[bullshit| gospel]]. And true to form, They believe that their religion is the only way of life and refuse to accept any other ways. As the rule of thumb goes, There is no 'conversation' with [[Christfags]]... they only convert. Hence any [[NO_U|debate]] done with him, is really an attempt at turning you into a [[christfag]]. Upon first glance it appears that this is a result of an inability to cope with reality; however, the desire to drag [[Dr._Steel|anyone]] and [[You|everyone]] into their mire of shame, confusion and fairy-tales is not a desperate attempt at relating to other people, but part of [[Shit_Nobody_Cares_About|a greater plan to gain more vote-swing, with which comes the insurance that their hare-brained nanny-laws will always pass unanimously]]. Especially in <s>[[Utah]]</s> <s>[[Florida]]</s> everywhere but [[Sweden]].

===<u>'''Creationism [[creationism|(see main article)]]'''</u>===
WOTM adherents maintain the idea that two centuries of consistent scientific data by thousands of logical minds is wrong and that Earth and life were not created by a causal chain of events but by an infinitely knowing, loving and powerful--yet seemingly indecisive and possibly bipolar--deity in less than a week.

=='''Wait a minute? WOTM? LWP? Wretched? WTF?'''==
There is some confusion as to how Ray-gay and his bunch are organized. The following diagram will explain.
<center>
[[Image:livingwaterschart.jpg]]
</center>

As you can see Living waters publications is the core of WOTM. And as such it is fragmented into smaller outreaches which serves as cash-cows for LWP.

==='''<u>Ambassador Alliances'''</u>===

The Ambassadors' Alliance is a global alliance of [[Church|churches]], para-church ministries, and individual Christians who share the common vision of fulfilling the [[troll|Great Commission]] and inspiring in every [[Christian]] a [[ego|God-glorifying passion]] to do the same. All members of the alliance—whether church, para-church ministry, or individual Christian—are committed to using the [[good person test|Law of God]] to help the unbeliever recognize their [[an hero|true spiritual condition]] and their need for [[bullshit|the Savior]], and to present the entirety of the gospel in a biblical way.

===<u>'''Deeper Conference'''</u>===

One of the many cash cows that LWP organizes so that they can sucker more people and do a mental circle jerk.

===<u>'''Transformed Conference'''</u>===

Same thing, though this one is more keyed to those who have started to see things a little more clearly. You could say it's the rinse cycle in the brainwashing machine.

===<u>'''School Of Biblical Evangelism'''</u>===

This is where they train [[moar]] of these [[Christfags]] to go forth and spread the [[bullshit|gospel]]. Of course half the time, they will use the [[good person test]] and end up being told to [[fuck you|go forth and multiply themselves]].

===<u>'''Way of the master'''</u>===

The most known outreach of LWP. In fact you think "way of the master" you no longer think 70's kung fu films with kick ass martial artists, you think now of a small New-zealander with a 70's pornstar mustache that is more likely to get intellectually ass-kicked by even a [[retard]].

It was divided in TV and radio components, until they sold the radio show concept to familynet and then it became Wretched.

===<u>'''Wretched'''</u>===
Wretched radio and TV are the offshoots of what was once WOTM radio. Familynet bought the concept and it's the same old shit, with the same host. It is believed that the only purpose it truly serves is to give Todd Friel a job.

=='''Members'''==
==='''<u>Kirk Cameron</u>'''===
[[image:Kirk_Cameron_dopey.jpg|thumb|right|This is what happens when child stars find religion, it's like they had a massive dose of [[fail]] injected in their brain.]]

<big>'''''Kirk Cameron'''''</big> is a former child star who used to play Mike Seaver on 80's sitcom ''Growing Pains'' where he claims to have converted from [[Atheism]] at age 17.  One of his first acts as a righteous born again Christian was to get his co-star and on-screen love interest Julie McCullough fired solely because he didn't like the fact that she had posed in ''Playboy''.  After the 80's have passed and in order to retain some of the glory of his past as a teen heartthrob he decided to target the [[Christfag]] market, thus getting the best of both worlds.

[[Some argue]] that he became an evangelist in order to to prove that he is [[not gay]]. If this is the case, he has [[fail]]ed to an almost unheard of degree, as pretty much every televangelists career ends with footage leaking of them strutting around a Bangkok nightclub in six inch heels, leading around a [[13 year old boy]] with 'cumsponge' written on his forehead by a leash.

He also starred in plenty of [[fail|direct-to-video]] productions where you can now find in dollar stores, Wal-mart discount bins and swap meets. <s>Most</s> All of the movies he has made are so bad that not even [[MST3K]] would want to touch it.

He claims he used to be a devout atheist, until he asked himself [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS| "What if  I  am wrong?"]] Today he is an ardent apologist, defending the faith with the most [[creationism|retarded arguments]], and wanting a pet [[crocoduck]].

==='''<u>Ray Comfort</u>'''===

[[image:Raybanana.jpg|thumb|right| Ray is about to nibble in the most Homo-erotic way on what he thinks is the "Atheist Nightmare".]]
<big>'''''Ray Comfort'''''</big> is a [[Christian]] minister and evangelist. Comfort, who has no formal training in anything except in [[bullshit|bullshiting]], started Living Waters Publications and The Way of the Master and has written a number of books that He and Kirk peddles in Jesus-flavored infomercials. But remember, they are not doing it for the money.

No, how can someone not "Be in it for the money" when they have written so many books on how to bug the shit out of everyone and have shows and use the internet to push their lies? The defense rests.

[[image:Todd_Friel_douchebag.jpg|thumb|right|Ray and Kirk found him frozen in the arctic, next to that dinosaur that leveled Tokyo.]]
<big>'''''Todd Friel'''''</big> He is an American radio and television host, Christian commentator, evangelist, and <s>former</s> washed up stand-up comedian. He used to host Way of the master radio where his douchebaggery flourished in two hour long verbal diarrhea. He now hosts a more appropriately named show called '''''"Wretched"'''''. He's also the proof you CAN stack shit that high. 

He serves as the "Comedic enforcement" of WOTM, a pet [[troll]] if you will. He has been used as a drama-generator, ambushing Atheists and other unbelievers with the usual garbage that WOTM has been prone to spit over the years.

==='''<u>Others WOTM pawns</u>'''===

Here is a list of people affiliated in one way or another with either Way of the master/Living Waters ministry/"Wretched". These folks use the techniques pimped by Ray Comfort and will try to sell his [[shit|gospel tracts, videos and other gimmicks]].

Also, when dealing with such individuals, one should consider that their training in their backgrounds supplements their "evangelism" (Example: Todd friel as a comedian or Tony's Law enforcement background). This can help in avoiding pitfalls while maximizing the [[lulz]].


===='''<u>TRISHA RAMOS</u>'''====
A pawn of "wretched" radio, most of her videos are just applications of the [[good person test]] via [[troll|fishing for sinners]] and just other asinine methods of evangelism, while pushing the various products that living waters ministries peddles for all the [[Christfags]] of the world.

*[http://www.youtube.com/user/fishwithtrish fishwithtrish youtube channel TROLL IT!]
*[http://www.fishwithtrish.com her site, just an offshoot of WOTM]

===='''<u>TONY "LAW MAN" MIANO</u>'''====
Another pawn. He uses the "fishing" approach as well. He uses open-air preaching, which is [[serious business]]. Lawman worked for 20 years as a deputy in the LA County Sheriff's Department with the latter part of that career as a chaplain to the law enforcement community. This, more than likely can be reflected in the way he assumes that he has [[bullshit|authority]] over [[you]].

He's also one of their instructors. Lawman heads up the evangelism training conducted by Way of the Master through their "Ambassadors Academies", which is a [[church|preacher farm]].

*[http://thelawmanchronicles.blogspot.com/ Tony Miano's blog. It's troll worthy!]

===='''<u>MARK SPENCE</u>'''====

Mark Spence is the dean of the way of the master [[bullshit|School of biblical evangelism]] which is a distinctly unique course in that it's entire focus is driven by [[Chronic Troll Syndrome| personal evangelism]]. 

He's also trained in being an illusionist, which more than likely helped with the flim-flam business of evangelism. . 

If you talk about how WOTM is about making money out of [[bullshit]] he will say that you do not know what you're talking about. 

* [http://www.youtube.com/user/MarkSpence777 youtube profile]

===='''<u>DAVID "HIP HOP" SHANNON</u>'''====

Hip Hop is the Sound jockey at Wretched Radio (formerly Way of the Master Radio). Alot of the slime you'll find comes from Hip Hop's labor in sifting through the web and editing the dirt he finds for each 50 minute program. 

===='''<u>EMEAL "EZ" ZWAYNE</u>'''====
EZ is the General Manager of Way of the Master / Living Waters ministries. He's the force behind the crass commercialization of way of the master. Ray comfort couldn't have sold his cheezy shit on his own. He needed someone with skills in marketing, and marketing he did.

===='''<u>DUANE BARNHART</u>'''====

If you've ever wondered who makes Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron look so good on their TV series, while being so full of [[fail]], he's the one that people should blame. 

But let us give credit where credit is due, it takes alot of skill for a man to be able to take Ray Comfort and be able to actually make him watchable for more than ten seconds.

===='''<u>RICK "BRAINIAC" APPLETON</u>'''====

Brainiac is the living breathing mass of [[bullshit|theological knowledge]] that answers the really tough questions on "Wretched Radio" (formerly Way of the Master Radio) and "Wretched TV". As hard as it is to believe, situations actually occur on the program where the host, Todd Friel, doesn't know the answer. Brainiac is always there to save the day and teach us something about [[Shit nobody cares about|Church history, Reformed theology, conference happenings, or Mark Driscoll's latest escapade.]]

=='''Tricks and Fail'''==
Like most evangelists, they have their tricks and their tell-tale arguments. WOTM specializes in [[gimmick]]s that can be best summed up as "Bumper-sticker theology". It is targeted at people who are of low-education and intelligence, which can be reflected in the majority of their [[fantards]].
===<u>'''Good Person Test[[Good Person Test|(see main article)]]'''</u>===
The Good Person Test (GPT), is a gimmick used by many [[Christfags]] to try and attempt conversion of a non-christfag into the flock. It uses a series of trick questions that merely waste your time and push their religion on you. It's a sales pitch and not playing along can give them a case of [[butthurt]].

==='''<u>Banana Argument</u>'''===

The banana argument is the most well known example of WOTM's of [[fail]] when it comes to being educated and just having any coherent thoughts. They claimed that this variation on the argument from design, saying that some things are the way they are because they were designed especially for our pleasure and comfort.

<center>
'''Banana Argument: [[FAIL]]'''
<youtube>nfv-Qn1M58I</youtube>
</center><br>


The conclusion: obviously the banana was designed by "Almighty God" for the benefit of human beings. Many also wonder if this is true, then the banana is also God's way to promote dildos and buttplugs since it looks like it's "designed" to do this as well.

The real nightmare is that there may be people in the world who would be convinced by the argument! Even though the banana, as we know it, is the product of agriculture, not the imagination of some fucktard. A month later, Ray made another video explaining that God made coconuts to [[Pat_Robertson|punish the Haitians for making a deal with Satan]].

==='''<u>Open-Air Preaching</u>'''===
Open air preaching or street preaching is the act of pushing religion to crowds of people in open places. WOTM specializes in that area, thus breeding among evangelicals a mass population of [[Chronic Troll Syndrome]].

==='''<u>Censorship</u>'''===
WOTM is known to try and silence critics on [[youtube]]. Their most common method is to disable ratings and [[banhammer]] all those who would post critique on their videos, be it by jest, or by logic. They will even go as far as to disable comments after a while in order to keep their [[fantards]] happy.

Of course this only adds to the [[lulz]] as bypassing youtube censors is as easy as downloading the video, uploading it, and matching the tags on the original, thus allowing free speech to prevail.


==='''<u>"Origin In School"</u>'''===
<center>
'''Dumbass, lies and videotape'''
<youtube>GN9zpf5cT0M</youtube> 
</center>

This latest stunt done by them, shows just how much Ray comfort is willing to sink to any dept to push his twisted ideology on the younger generation. Learning that the book is now public domain, Comfort and his stooges decided to vandalize Charles Darwin's work "The Origins of the species" with an introduction written by Comfort himself. This stunt is sponsored with the help of these organizations: 

- Campus Crusade For Christ (Anti-student organization) 

- Answers in Genesis (Anti-science and education)

- Alliance Defense fund (Lawyers. Anti-humanity)

In their own words:

<i>This special 280-page edition not only contains an abridged Origin of Species but also has a 50-page Introduction that reveals the dangerous fruit  of evolution, Hitler's undeniable connections to the theory, Darwin's racism,  and  his disdain for women. It counters the claim that creationists are "anti-science" by citing numerous scientists who believed that God created the universe — scientists such as Einstein, Newton, Copernicus, Bacon, Faraday, Pasteur, and Kepler.</i>

This "introduction" has been retrieved. It can be viewed [http://www.youshare.com/Guest/338938b16b1af166.pdf.html here]. It is highly recommended that you get a barf bucket before reading this.

Also retrieved is a list of schools that are '''''confirmed targets''''' by this endeavor.

=='''Finances'''==
WOTM, like many ministries of it's ilk, makes money from the [[fantards]] they have. In fact they make over [[9000]] when it comes to the greenbacks. It's proof again that there is a sucker born-again every day.

Since WOTM/Living waters is a 501(3)c nonprofit organization, it's easy to know how much money they make since it's public information. You can view them all at these locations;

*[http://dynamodata.fdncenter.org/990_pdf_archive/270/270094016/270094016_200412_990.pdf 2004 990 form]
*[http://dynamodata.fdncenter.org/990_pdf_archive/270/270094016/270094016_200512_990.pdf 2005 990 form]
*[http://dynamodata.fdncenter.org/990_pdf_archive/270/270094016/270094016_200612_990.pdf 2006 990 form]

In 2006 Living Waters Publications sold 4.5 million dollars worth of merchandise that only cost the organization 1.9 million (a 137% markup).  Living waters also took in  $736,472 in donations.  This gave the org a net revenue of 3.3 million to be added to the 1.4 million it had in the bank at the beginning of the year.<br>

The expenditures for 2006 list fund raising receiving 1.2%,  program services receiving 24.5%, and managerial and general receiving 74.1% of the 3 million spent. If you are running a nonprofit and only 24% of your expenditures are going to the programs and services the org was created to address, and 74% are going to Managerial and General expenses,[[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|you're doin' it wrong]].

Further information can be read [http://raytractors.blogspot.com/2008/08/piety-of-ray-little-web-sleuthing.html here], it is well detailed.

=='''Drama Generation'''==
One should note that trying to attack WOTM directly is pointless. First, these guys are [[attention whores]] and second, they mention in their training manuals how to handle hecklers. 

The best drama to gain however is from their adepts who are not too swift and can be a huge load of [[lulz]], since they do not look at the founders of WOTM with a critical eye, or their ideology for that matter.

The best drama generating techniques are;

* Remind them that they are taking their money to make stupid shit (like their show) instead of feeding the poor or helping the homeless.
* Parody their videos. (WOTM is known to be anti-lulz).
* Make videos series that prove that Ray and Kirk's arguments are full of [[Fail]]
* Deny the existence of God.
* Tell them that the [[Good person test]] is just a sales pitch and you're not buying.
* Question the veracity of the bible.
* Question their motives.
