[[Image:Brenda-williams-photo-only.jpg|thumb|right|It's a bad idea to be black in Scranton, you just might get shot by four pigs with [[Bukkake|nothing better to do]].]]

On [[Truth|May 29, 2009]], four upstanding [[Pennsylvania|Scranton]] [[Pig|Police Officers]] were enjoying a round of manlove at the local Clarion Hotel when one of them thought it would be fun to huff poppers and drive around the north section of town looking for [[Police brutality|niggers to shoot]].

After a few hours, our lovely protagonists came across a [[Whore|black woman]] on her front porch with a cardboard sign that read, "Help me commit suicide."  Only too happy to oblige, the pigs [[Serious business|shot her up]] like [[Isabella Valentine]] at a [[Fun|crack infested male-dominated KKK rally]], giving her the exit out of life she always dreamed of.

<S>8999 internets go to Brenda Williams for getting the police to do her dirty work for her!</S> Nope, one shy.  She had a knife.  They had four guns.  And she would never post her noodz on /b/ again.

The amazing facet of truth regarding this situation would be the lack of information released to the public by the [http://www.scrantonpa.gov/scrantonpd/index.asp SPD] regarding this incident and any other [[Juggalette420|lulz]] that may have perpetrated, since it's always a fun time when local pigs are [[Unwarranted self importance|granted the right]] to kill any citizen of this fine city.  

Clearly, [[You|no one]] is safe.

==OH NOES I SHOT VETERAN!!1==

{{Q|brenda is my couzin and i miss her and i wan’t to know the cops who shot her. my nana jeanne lewis is sad my dad ellis lewis is really sad and mad my aunt louwize is wich brenda williams mother is and my cuz alona williams wich is brenda’s dauter thank you p.s. i don’t i spelled every thing rite|Deion Lewis on June 7, 2009, [http://melaniannews.wordpress.com/2009/05/31/brenda-williams-slain-by-police-officers/ proving niggers have no education]}}

Scranton police officers responded to a disturbance call [[Fuck you|last Thursday]] ([http://www.thetimes-tribune.com/opinion/inform_public_on_shooting srsly it was]) in the north section of town.  Upon entering the front of the property, one of the pigs noticed a black woman on the porch dancing to the newest [[Tranny|Lady Gaga]] single, '''Cat Baker''', in honor of fellow fake New Yorker [[Cheyenne Cherry]].  Deducing that this lady must be selling crack off her porch due to her skin color, the officers approached the black person with the intention of sexing it up for some [[Weev|white fun time]].  However, the suspect didn't wish to share her [[Ass|alleged crack]] with freeloaders, so she ran for her life into her front door, at which time all four cops whipped out their [[Penis|guns]] and proceeded to make a nigger golf course [[Fuck you|for the children]].  

None of the neighbors who witnessed the tragedy actually heard any of the shots fired.  After being interviewed by the [http://thetimestribune.com Times Tribune] one brave soul admitted that he overheard one of the officers commenting, "We can always say we did it for the lulz."  Another witness incorrectly identified the shots as snare hits from the [[Crap|Lady Gaga single]], which is why she do quickly dialed 911.

[[Image:Axelswife1 do not want.png|thumb|right|The only witness to this terrible crime.]]

[[Anonymous]] has discovered through many hours of [[Masturbation|rigorous investigation]] that the four officers shot Ms. Williams because she allegedly had brandished a knife.  Now, no one on Earth knows why in the fuck this nigger was allowed to carry a knife, as it is common knowledge niggers are banned from carrying anything in their possession except [[Jenkem]] and shitty dimebags to sell for [[Tom Serson]].  Equally puzzling is the lack of initiative on the part of the police officers, who clearly were too much of a bunch of pussies to take down a 52-year old black lady without shooting her to death.

Another interesting fact is that Brenda was a retired Air Force veteran with a history of mental illness.  Clearly she has fit the stereotype of an active member of the [[Shit|United States Military]].  Upon discovering this information, welfare officials should have sent her to the projects to live with the rest of the hood rats, but mistakes were made and four lucky nigger-hating cops had a wonderful time using her as a human target!

It's plain as day that the Scranton PD cooked this up for the lulz, since it serves no other purpose than to end up as gossip fodder on [[iCarly|The View]].

After he was able to squeeze out a few loads into [[Whore|Celine Dion]]'s face, Elliot held a press conference where he informed the public that:

* the dead nigger was [[Yes|asking for it]],
* they weren't releasing [[BAWWW|ANY INFORMATION]] about the shooting,

On June 1st, 2009, Steve Corbett posted an article on his blog entitled, [[WTF|Police Shooting Sparks Many Questions]].  Since the Scranton PD wasn't talking due to being afraid of having themselves posted on Jew like [[Black Jesus|Cheyenne Cherry]], [[Anonymous]] decided to contact Chief Elliot to set up a meeting on IRC and get to the bottom of it once and for all.

===Corbett's Copypasta===

'''<big><big><span style="text-decoration:blink"><span class="co;[TITS OR GTFO];[HAI];0;convo;RED"></span></span></big></big>'''

<div class="convo">
<pre>

Even in death, Brenda Williams extended great dignity and power to those who found themselves in her presence. At eternal rest in her coffin in the sad hour before her funeral service, her face reflected a silent grace, offering quiet solace for those who stood before her to pay a final respect.

Scranton police shot and killed Williams last week in her second-floor apartment after responding to a report of a disturbance. Details are sketchy while Pennsylvania State Police conduct an investigation. Williams wielded a knife, according to newspaper reports, although no police official has publicly confirmed that fact. What is confirmed is that Williams was a troubled woman who suffered from mental illness, a 52-year-old Air Force veteran who needed help.

Instead, she found death at the hands of police.

Standing before her coffin yesterday, I looked at the photograph of Williams that family had balanced against the soft casket satin. Wearing a big smile, Williams posed in her military uniform and seemed to have the world at her fingertips. Looking at her folded hands, I knew that her fingertips now remained still forever. No more would she tickle the keys of the alto saxophone she once played so well. No more would she hold her daughter who sat in the front row of the church during services with wet tears streaming down her cheeks.

Now the city where Williams lived all her life will forever frame a tragedy that left her in a pool of blood that poured from her body when the gunfire stopped.

Four Scranton police officers remain on paid leave until the investigation is finished. Williams is dead and gone. But the power of community that speaker after speaker stressed during her funeral remains. That power serves as a beacon that guides the search for truth for the many God-fearing family members and friends who now expect answers to the many unanswered questions that make Williams’ death all the harder to understand. 

Too many versions of what happened are circulating throughout the city. And there is no way to avoid pointing out the stark fact that four white men killed this black woman who might have lived if only the professionals on the scene had found another way.

Second-guessing the cops will draw criticism. But unless we second-guess the cops this sad and violent act might happen again. PSP will hopefully second-guess every move the officers on the scene made. Unless that happens another mentally ill resident of this city might fall in a burst of bullets that with training might be avoided. 

Scranton police simply do not receive enough training to handle what cops call EDPs, emotionally disturbed persons.

Standing in the rear of the church yesterday, I listened to a wise church elder and former pastor reassure the congregation that the truth will set us free. “If it doesn’t come out in the wash, it will come out in the rinse,” he said to laughter that broke the somber tension that filled the church. I sensed a growing confidence that will be necessary to take on the system that I expect to be less than forthcoming with the answers that are required for everyone to learn from what Williams’ brother called a “senseless” act. 

Yesterday, Williams’ lifeless body helped provide power to those who felt her spirit, a power that will be imperative for those who want to carry the torch of truth and shine it on every incident where police respond to a call for help. Death often nurtures the quest for social justice. Sometimes enemies become friends. Sometimes friends become enemies. In this case, the end must become the beginning as we ask ourselves over and over again, “Who speaks for Brenda Williams?” We must look ourselves in the mirror and ask if we truly care about each other and about the city we love. We must reflect on what went wrong last week. We must promise to do our best to help rather than hurt.

Williams now dwells in what a pastor yesterday called “her mansion.” We must now ask ourselves what we plan to do about this sad and violent place that we call home. Life and death hang in the balance of our response.

Upon examing the evidence gathered by [[Basement dwellers|internet detectives]], the following lulzy tidbits of information come to light regarding Brenda Williams' killing.  We can't call it a murder because that would be [[libel]], but hey, if the [[OJ Simpson|glove fits]], right?  

===Killing Black Women Is Serious Business===

For all Mensa-reject n00b hippies, we've taken the care of eliminating the [[TL;DR]] crap and getting down to [[Serious fucking business|serious business]].  The following are [[IRL]] [[IM PRESSIN CHARGES|quotes]] taken from [http://scrantontimes.com/news/scranton_police_release_more_info_on_shooting_victim an article] written by Scranton Times Staff Writer [[Amateur|Erin L. Nissley]]:

*On Wednesday, [[Billo The Clown|city Police Chief David Elliot]] released information about Brenda Williams' prior contact with Scranton police. The 52-year-old woman was shot and killed May 28 after police responded to her [http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=1422+N.+Lincoln+Ave+Scranton+PA&um=1&ie=UTF-8&split=0&gl=us&ei=NvIwStuGGILBtwfTs_XjBQ&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=image&resnum=1 North Lincoln Avenue apartment], where she was allegedly brandishing a knife.
*A Scranton police officer involved in the fatal shooting had contact with her less than a week before she was killed, Chief Elliott said.
*Ms. Williams had made [[over 9000|17 calls]] to police in the last 11 years, starting with a call [http://www.gpo.gov/su_docs/fedreg/a980414c.html April 14, 1998], when she allegedly threatened to commit suicide.
*Chief Elliott refused to [[STFU|identify]] the officer who had contact with Ms. Williams prior to the shooting, nor would he comment on whether the prior contact played any part in how the officers responded to the [[Last Thursday|May 28]] call. Ms. Williams was reportedly wielding a knife when she was shot after four officers responded to her apartment for what Chief Elliott has described as a [[Asperger's syndrome|mental health check]].
*Ms. Williams' brother, [[Snitch|Myron B. Williams]], said Wednesday that his sister made the calls out of concern for her daughter, however unfounded her fears.  "The [[CP|welfare]] of her child was of number one importance," he said. "[[Jail|That]] was first and foremost in her thinking."  ''FUCKKK THE CHILD WAS THERE WHEN SHE WAS SHAWT!!!  [[Sarcasm|ULTIMATE PWN]]!!!'''
*'''[[LOL WUT|All four officers involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave]].'''

===Blacks Helped Jews Do WTC===

The Times-Tribune's comment forums (convienently available at the end of each article) lit up with both [[Unwarranted self importance|butthurt Republicunts]] and [[Anonymous|pizza raping lulz defenders]] as the flame war ignited, blowing up like Hiroshima 2.0 in Israel.

|Without them releasing any details at all, it makes them look like they are guilty, or have something to hide. It seems that something is wrong with the Scranton Police.

This has been the third time in seven years that the Scranton Police have done this. I'm sure other regional cities like [[Shit|Wilkes-Barre]], Mexican, and [[Meth|Williamsport]] routinely deal with these same sorts of instances that the Scranton Police do, yet these cities have zero police shootings to Scranton's three in seven years.

The question is "[[No|Did this woman pose such a threat that she needed to be shot multiple times in the chest"]]? They could have shot once, maybe in the arm to disarm her.....but to kill her? She wasn't a criminal, [[True|just a deeply disturbed woman]]. These cops should work in Philly, Chicago, Washington, D.C., New York City, then they would have a real wakeup call.

Consider this: If you have a holstered gun and you are very well trained in a quick draw, you can likely draw and fire your weapon in a 1-to-1.1 seconds. The second shot goes off about 2/10’s of a second later. The third shot is released in another 2/10’s of a second.  if someone standing 21 feet away attacks you with a knife, he will strike his target in 1.5 seconds.

The police did not put that knife in her hand. Is there a new law now that says police officers can not protect themselves. If someone is coming at me with a knife, I'm not going to take the time to aim for an arm or a leg, or sit them down on the couch for a therapy session. I'm going to shoot at the largest area on the body where there is the smallest chance of missing. The bottom line is, the woman had a knife. None of us know what she was doing with it or whether or not she advanced toward them with it. Police have a split second decision to make when someone has a weapon. The Police are not suppose to be your mother, father, therapist, etc. The family should have looked out for this woman by getting her the help she needed. And, for the person calling these officers cowards, I would love to see you go out and do their job.

It is hard to say if the police were justified without any of the details, but it seems that with four officers on the scene vs. one female with a knife that this could and should have ended differently. The Scranton Police come off as heavy handed and unprofessional quite often. Wasn't there a non-lethal option like a tazer that could have been used instead of shooting her dead? [[LOL WUT|I do not think race had anything at all to do with this]], but I also do not think this was handled professionally at all.|Bill, a little misled but otherwise not that gay|I lived in The Scranton/Wiles Barre Area for five years - between 1990 and 1995. I was forty when I moved there and it was the first place anyone ever referred to me as a "girl," It was the first time I ever heard anyone referred to (in real life) as "colored." Northeast Pennsylvania was the first place I ever saw actual Klu Klux KLan people in robes walking the streets handing out flyers. It was the first place I heard Asian people referred to as "Chinks." It was where I (who had narrowly missed being killed by an IRA bomb in London in 1975) saw a city sponsored banner spread across the main street into the business district welcoming Gerry Adams. It had the only public radio station that actually broadcast "Focus on the Family." It was surrounded by an automobile dumb built on top of old slag heaps. It was one of the most sad and downtrodden places I ever lived. I remember on Christmas Eve the Protestant church I went to had it's parking lot taken over by overflow from the Catholic Church goers a block away because they didn't think Protestants believed in Jesus. (True story) Remember, it's the setting for "THE OFFICE," and Championship Season. No one has yet to touch the surface of how corrupt, racist, homophobic, nasty and ignorant that part of the world is. A.Ferrugio, Davis, California|A. Ferrugio, dumb enough to put down her real name and city of residence|I've lived here 34 years, never did I see Klan members. Ms. Ferrugio, are you offended when someone calls you a "girl"?

I live in Pittston and i have seen them in Wilkes Barre and also in Scranton just driving thru the city.. Maybe you should get out of your housing project more often and see what's really going on out there..|Jeff, srsly still being a faggot|The Williams' family lost a daughter, a sister, and a mother. She died at the hands of those that were sent to protect her. The whole situation is very unfortunate. How can we blame the family????? Brenda was 52 years old and had rights. The family could not tell her where to live, yet they always kept an eye on her and took care of her and her daughter's needs. THEY SHOULD BE COMMENDED NOT CONDEMNED!!!! I assume that before a policeman is issued a weapon and sent on the street he/she must be prepared physically and menatally to deal with a wide array of situations. Most officers handle this daily without tragic circumstances, and go home safely to their families. I believe that you have to look at the mental state of these officers. What kind of day did they have? Was it the begining or end of their shift? How was their homelife? Were their any warning signs? What kind of interactions did they have with minorities? What kinds of fears, stereotypes, or attitudes did they have toward minorities? What is the overall attitude of the Sranton Police in general towards diversity and minorities?
Brenda is dead because of a decision made by a group of officers that determined that she was THREAT to their safety, and that deadly force was the appropriate response. That's a problem!!!! I don't believe that all the officers came to that conclusion, but someone did, and the result is that Brenda is dead. It was an overreaction that triggered something in the mind(s) of the
officer(s), and the result was the death of Brenda. Have some sympathy for Brenda's family and especially for her daughter.
Then, you can worry about the unnamed officers that are on paid leave, that will not be prosecuted, that will not lose their jobs, and still are able to go home to their families everyday. Peace|JB, hitting the [[Weed|KB]]|}}|color=red}}

===I Was There, And I Don't Know What Happened===
Adding moar to the lulz were new posters to the Scranton Times article mentioned above.  These n00bz vehemently claimed to:

*[[Lie|have knowledge about the incident firsthand.]]
*[[Lie|have been at the crime scene when the incident took place.]]

Judge for yourselves, Anonymous.

{{Q|Look, they Scranton Cops did wrong lets all get over it. This women was shot 6 times in the chest by 3 of the officers on paid leave. The 4th whom is 6'5 well over 300 lbs did not fire I guess he did not feel she was a threat as the other three did. The Williams family we be sitting pretty after this is all said and done. People lets move on did you forget where you live?|Dave,  06/11/09 - 9:30PM, who forgot where he lived}}

{{Q|No, let's NOT get over it. Someone needs to teach these Scranton cops a lesson and if its own internal policing division can't handle it then the federal government can get involved. This has nothing to do with the race card, this is about the abuse of power granted by the very oaths police take. Cops have too much power and not enough training, common sense or both and as citizens we need to take a stand! I urge the Williams family not to take this lying down. I for one can't say I can trust my life in a Scranton cop's hands, not after this. Three times is enough.|Steven,  06/11/09 - 11:18PM, the only smart poster in this shitty thread}}

{{Q|It amazes me how all you people know what happened to poor Brenda and the poor police officers and I was there and I dont know what happened. All I know is a sweet quiet woman who use to play with my dog and kiss him, is dead. I miss Brenda and wish I could have helped her, but I saw her on Monday and Tuesday and she was a little aggitated but calm. I was there when she talked to her mother Monday night, and she was calm. So when did she get so out of hand, that the police came banging at her door when she was upstairs on her couch. I dont know what happened and I was right there.|Confused,  06/11/09 - 11:43PM, needs to get off the rock}}

{{Q|You people must be delusional too. Where does it say she was hit 6times in the chest? You want police to be social workers and psychologist too? One of the cops was 6'5" How do you know that? How do any of you know what happened there unless you were there? Now why aren't all you big mouth idiots raising a stink that a black muslim shot two soldiers on recruiting duty. The did not have a knife? Why aren't you raising a stink that a black man killed a 1 year old infant by beating the child to death?|Santo,  06/12/09 - 3:28AM, proving mexicans should not have opinions}}


Some argue that ''Dave'' is actually one of the Scranton cops involved in this shooting posting, or a witness to the crime too chickenshit to come forward.  Others say he's telling the [[Bullshit|absolute truth]].  As long as [[Cops|they]] did it for the lulz, does it really matter?

==Mr. Jarbola said Mr. Jarbola said Mr. Jarbola said==

[[Image:Lackawanna County DA Andy Jarbola.jpg|thumb|right|The man, the myth, the lulzkiller; Andy Jarbola.]]

On June 15, 2009, [[Fucktard|Lackawanna County DA Andy Jarbola]] announced to his scat brethren (and then after that, the city of Scranton) that the whole kit and caboodle was completely and totally for the lulz.  In their version of leetspeak, this means the [[murder|shooting]] was justified, or the cops were high on too much Jenkem and forgot to call the mental health professionals.

The following [[Lie|facts]] were [[Jizztini|garnered]] from [http://www.scrantontimes.com/news/da_says_police_shooting_was_justified#articleComments an article] in the Scranton Times (rearing its ugly head to smell up the roller-skating rink of [[JB|journalism]]);

* She was shot multiple times the night of May 28 after officers responded to her North Lincoln Avenue apartment for a mental health check.
* Mr. Jarbola identified the four officers who were at the apartment as '''Cpl. Robert Stanek''', a 16-year veteran who was the [[Rapist|supervisor]] at the scene; '''Officer James Smith''', an 11-year veteran who had had previous contact with Ms. Williams, and '''Officers Jason Knoch''' and '''Eric Jordan''', who have been on the force for just over a year.  Eric isn't apparently cool enough to have the word Officer next to his name, so that means he is the catcher and Jason is the pitcher.  [[BAWWW|How cute!]]
* Mr. Jarbola said officers were preparing to [[V&|cite]] Ms. Williams for [[Prison rape|disorderly conduct]] when she went to the kitchen of her apartment and returned with a [[Dildo|knife]], similar to a chef's knife, with an 8-inch blade.
* As she approached [[Dumbledore|Officer Smith]] with the knife extended in front of her, police commanded her to drop the weapon, Mr. Jarbola said. When she did not, three officers opened fire, wounding her [[Over_9000|five times]], Ms. Williams also was wounded by falling on the knife.  '''[[Win|ZOMG HOW DO I SHOT KNIFE]]'''
* Officers Smith and Knoch fired their weapons twice, and Cpl. Stanek fired his once, the DA said.  This is another example of hearing "Mr. Jarbola said, Mr. Jarbola said, Mr. Jarbola said, Mr. Jarbola said.", enough to drive a /b/tard to lulzcide.

Some argue that DA Jarbola completed a very thorough investigation with the best intent of finding out the truth.  Internet tough guys and girls who can uses computer in Scranton knew better and called bullshit on his faggotry.

The lollercoaster was on!
