™
<big><big>'''™'''</big></big> stands for trademark. This is usually found next to the "Good thing" and "Bad thing" phrases, as well as all [[GNU]] software (free as in [[Evildoer Korea]]). 

Also it is overused by asshole elitist fans of Monkey Island games in order to kiss the incredibly [[fat]] ass of L. Ron Gilbert, creator of those games.
