''As we obey and trust Yahweh, we give praise to the name of [[God]]. Through faith and works, let us never stop praising Yahweh, Our Master. Amen.''

==No wai!==

Yahweh!  As Youtube spreads across the internets like [[AIDS]] in a gay nightclub, itâ€™s only natural that the odd meme pops up from time to time. One of the better memes involves Reverend Alecia love of the one true God, Yahweh.

==Jew==
Also the forbidden, original power name of [[God]]. It is said that Jews go to hell if they say it.  However, this is redundant because typical snivelling kikes live a life of taking your precious [[jewgold]] and [[rape|raeping]] your daughter and will be spending eternity there either way.

==Fail of a translation==
Some [[Christians|dumbfucks]] decided that the hebrew letter equivalents of YHVH is pronounced Yahweh. It is not pronounced Yahweh. Or [[Jehovah]] for that matter, which is even a bigger fail of a translation, which isn't surprising, coming from the same people who claim that the earth was created [[last thursday]].
