Btw
[[Image:BTW_X_Ad_Men_Color.jpg|thumb|Wow cool photo!! Btw, is he touching your penis?!]]
An e-[[acronym]] for '''B'''y '''T'''he '''W'''ay.

It is usually maintained by [[IRC]] users who are living in the glory years of their lives (although for most other people that [[time]] is gloriful). Most often it's constructed in a way to give a "conversation" a new direction, since the person in question lacks any verbal capabilities to create well-versed sentences avoiding annoying shit acronyms. 

[[IRL]] BTW is usually replaced and/or completed with phonetic compulsions like "uhmm" and "ehr", especially when addressing the other [[sex]]. ''Btw'' is also a great tool to make a point after some whiny rambling.
