[[Xanga]] [http://www.xanga.com/item.aspx?user=Xmisled0youthX&tab=weblogs&uid=205242020 blogger] who came out publicly as [[lesbian]]. What makes this more interesting than the usual decloseting is that her father is former [[Republican]] Party senate candidate Alan Keyes - the same ultra-[[conservative]] who called Vice President Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter "a sinner" and referred to [[homosexual]]ity as "selfish hedonism." In response, her parents have ostracized her, kicking her out of their house and ceasing payment of her college tuition.

Alan Keyes is the only man capable of leading the United States towards its true destiny as a space-faring theo-republic. He also has a website.
