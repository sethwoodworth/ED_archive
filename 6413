'''Pig''' can refer to:
# [[:Category:Epithets|The formal term]] for [[Cop|police officer]].
# Synonymous with [[fat]], as in: ''Put down the fork, you fucking '''pig'''''.
# The #1 cause of [[Swine flu|rampant disease, death and disorder]].
# A [[fat]], [[hairy]], dirty, smelly - but extremely tasty - mammal.
# [[You]]

'''Pigs''' are commonly depicted as small, adorable pink [[animals]], with a squiggly little corkscrew tail and a cheery disposition.

Ha ha, fuckers, guess again. 

The most common type of pig is a [[Fat|giant]] fucking beast, topping a couple hundred pounds, with thick, dark hair and warts,and a power level [[over 9,000]]. 

Trapped within this Jew lies one of the most delicious foods known to man: pork. 

Pigs can be taught to stand upright, open doors, and even speak a few words of English, but who cares? Tasty animals deserve to be eaten even if intelligent. That's our god-given right as humans!

Pork is God's gift to man that can only be eaten by his most [[Irony|chosen people.]] Anything can be improved with a little pork, especially if this comes in the form of bacon. Even pork steak can be improved with bacon ([[seriously]]). Chicken ''cordon bleu?'' Chicken wrapped in bacon, covered with cheese. Bacon wrapped in bacon? Now that's [[divide by zero|apocalyptic yet tasty]]. 

In modern agriculture, pigs can be used to make delicious, [[meat]]y [[sausage]]s. Before you use a pig for this though, first make very sure that it's not merely a [[furry]] in its [[fursuit]]. If you become embroiled in a love affair with a [[furry]] who has a pig [[fursona]] in which she is a [[domme]], then you stand a good chance of being [[Pun|ham]]-[[fisted]].

=== Who Doesn't Eat Pork? ===

* '''Jews''': It's not Kosher! Meaning, it reminds them too much of themselves, so eating pigs will mean a one-way ticket to [[Hell]] for eating their own kind. [[Cannibal|Those who don't mind eating their kinfolk]] won't eat it anyway because they [[fail|can't cook]] or use a fucking thermometer.
* '''[[Arabs|Towel-heads]]s''': It's treifah! Meaning, it's the only critter dirtier and smellier than Jews, meaning they won't eat it due to years of Jihad against said Jews (and everyone else). Besides, who wants to go to hell for eating a Jew when you could get 50 virgins for [[jihad|Blowing yourself up]]? 
Oddly, [[Cannibalism|pigs will eat other pigs]] if given the chance. Also, [[truth|human meat tastes like pork]] (No it doesn't, it tastes like lamb).
