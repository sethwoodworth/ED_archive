[[Image:Nader.jpg|thumb|Debate? Or a simple game of "House"?]]

A perennial candidate for [[President]] of the [[United States]], Ralph Nader has actually won the election on numerous occasions, both by popular vote and by Divine Intervention. However, the Republicans and conservatives managed to steal his election every single time. He doesn't mind, because that means he can keep running, whereas if he actually won, he'd have to stop after the second time. 

He is most notable for writing a book about seatbelts and calling [[Obama]] an black person.
