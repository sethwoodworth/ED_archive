Hamlet
'''''Hamlet''''' is another play written by that [[homosexual|fag]] William Shakespeare [[at least 100 years ago]].  It's said to be one of his most popular plays, even though absolutely nothing interesting happens whatsoever until every single character [[die]]s, at which point it becomes quite entertaining for the remaining 2 minutes.

It's kind of like masturbating for the fifth time in a day, lots of boring buildup just for a little bit of entertainment at the end.

== Plot ==
[[Image:15g76mx_th.gif|thumb]]
An [[emo]] kid named Hamlet goes crazy and sees his dad's [[penis|ghost]].  His dad says that his bro, Claudius, [[Pwned|killed]] him with [[lolwut|ear poison]] so he could [[fuck]] his wife and be king.  Oddly, no one seemed to realize this earlier, considering right after the king died Claudius fucked the king's widow in public and became king.

For some reason some other characters are there, like this old senile dude named [[John McCain|Bolonius]] or something and his two kids, a [[Whore|whore]] and another [[Emo|emo]]  kid.  Hamlet rapes the [[Whore|whore]] and kills her dad--because he's crazy like that--and then the whore goes crazy herself.  And then she drowns, because everyone knows [[fact|when you go crazy you drown]].   

After a bunch of pointless shit happens, Hamlet fucks his mom and has [[Buttsecks|buttsaix]] with the other [[emo]] kid, and somehow everyone that anyone would give a shit about gets either stabbed or poisoned.  There are also a bunch of other characters that do stuff but no one gives a shit about them. Ironically, they are the only ones that live.

== Trivia ==

*Shakespeare originally planned for the entire cast to have an on-stage orgy in the finale.  But since all actors back then were guys and were afraid of [[Homosexual|coming out of the closet]] because they would be burned as a witch, they killed each other instead.

*"To be or not to be" is the quote most favored by [[Intellectual|stupid people]] trying to appear smart. If they had bothered to actually read the play (often printed at the back of dildo boxes), they would see the quote is not about being or not being, but about [[Suicide|using emo clothing]].

*The meme "Goodnight, sweet prince" originated from this play.
