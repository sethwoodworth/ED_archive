Undisputed master of Photoshop [[lulz]].

His penis is legendary.  And shiny.

Due to some medical concern that was entirely [[tl;dr]], RFJason is outrageously thin and can be easily inserted into [[dgt]]'s rectum.

Whined about Livejournal Abuse to the Washington Post.

His mom told the New York Times that [[incest|his grandfather molested him]]

Livejournal available at {{lj|rfjason}}

Lawyers attacked his weak spot for massive damage, to the tune of $74,252.56. Good Game! http://www.citmedialaw.org/sites/citmedialaw.org/files/2009-04-09-Default%20Judgment%20Against%20Fortuny.pdf

==RFJason Craigslist Pwning==
In August 2006, RFJason created the [[RFJason CL Experiment]], and [[pwned|laid waste]] to all of [[Craigslist]]. RFJason regularly self-references this 7 days of infamy where he appears on the internet, including his blog, livejournal, and his blog. This is in spite of people no longer giving a shit about RFJason.

''This article is oldmeme, you can help by forgetting about it.''

== The Truth ==
RFJason was the mastermind in the largest case of [[Troll's remorse]] the Internet has ever seen. His time on ED was shortlived and produced mostly [[Unfunny]] material. At the peak of his popularity, he was behind the [[RFJason CL Experiment|Craigslist Experiment]] troll. Making fake [[Craigslist]] ads is definitely [[old meme]] but with the help of the IRL [[media]] it exploded beyond his control. At first he basked in the attention and popularity he wished he had in Highschool but soon [[IRL]] caught up to him. 

  "<RFJason> oh fuck, they found the address of my apartment and posted a picture of my front door"
  "<RFJason> I'm going to downplay it to the media and hope they forget"
  "<RFJason> Hay, can u guys delete the RFJason_CL_Experiment page?"
  "<ED*> No! Fuck off!"

After a bunch of crying and whining he left ED fearing for his life. ED continued to have shitty service for weeks due to the large amount of [[faggots]] being referred from major news sites. Everybody laughed at RFJason for backing out of a decent troll and media stunt then laughed some moar when he was about to be killed by 10,000 niggers that had his IRL address. 

'''Lessons to Learn'''
* Never back down on a good troll even in the face of death. Shout "IDIFTL" as you go out in a blaze of glory. 
* Use an alias when you talk to the media or make something public that could cause people to burn your house down. 
* Never show weakness (even if the feds are raiding your colo rack over some DMCA shit etc)
