An '''E-penis''' or '''E-pen0r''' is the virtual power someone has through control over others through computers as long as that control does not extend to [[IRL|real life]], like doing hacking that causes you to gain real money. Simply put, E-penis is a measure of how much power you have on the [[internets]]. E-penis can be from power from controlling a [[BBS]], [[chat room]], [[ISP]], [[live journal]], [[message board]], [[website]], or [[wiki]]. It can come from being powerful in a game (whether from wasting their life away to gain skill or by cheating). It can also be from the old-fashioned past-time of mailbombing; maybe even Denial of Service attacks over IRC (large scale DoS get you sent to [[prison]]). [[Fact|Pretty much, the larger your E-penis is, the less you're really worth in real life.]]

E-penis has and always will be a source of drama. The examples are too numerous to list.

==Psychology==
The E-penis is based off [[E-psychiatrist]] Freud's theory of [[penis]] envy. Freudian states that [[women]] on the [[internets]] lack the [[Rich_and_beautiful|powerful]], strong, genitalia of a [[man]] and therefore make it up by [[whore|whoring]] themselves.  Conversely, [[13 year old boys]] play ''[[Starcraft]]'' and [[mod]] on shitty [[forums]].  However, [[Trap|traps]] have been shown to have bigger E-Penes than men and women.

==Examples==
*[[Newgrounds]]: Newgrounds is a site notorious for its e-penis sucking. Usually n00bs like/have to suck the mods/regulars e-penis.

*[[FanFiction.Net]]: Is a site that thrives on e-penis suckings. It's one giant circle jerk of telling people how awesome someone's story is, regardless of how terrible it is. Most fan art web sites/forums fall into this category as well. (See below.)

*[[LiveJournal]]: If you've read one of the numerous internet blogs on how to draw animefurfag eyes, you can receive E-penis massages here.

*[[GameFAQs]]: Apparently, no matter how noobish you are everywhere else, they'll give your e-penis a handjob as long as you've been there for a while (and make shitty attempts at humor).

*[[DeviantArt]]: [[Nick Simmons|l2trace]]

*[[Last.FM]]: Announce to the world that you listen to music.
