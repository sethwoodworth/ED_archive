'''Wyoming''' is the smallest state, not by size, but by population. It is the only state that actually needs the "below" part of "A population of 500,000 and below shall only constitute one representative in the House of Representatives." This is because the state is so [[Hick|buttfucking]] boring and lifeless that not even the equally boring and retarded [[Mormons]] stayed here when [[butthurt|trying to escape persecution]]. Now they just drive the 80 miles from Salt Lake to Evanston to buy full strength [[porn]] and liquor.

==Where Men are Men, and Sheep are Nervous==
Most of the population of Wyoming is either [[Christian]] hicks and [[Mexicans|Mexican'ts]]. There are so many fucking retards that [[Republicans]] make up nine fucking tenths of the population. Usually you can see these idiots strutting around with mullets, or alternatively, [[Pedophile|hanging around outside of public schools]] waiting for kids to come out so they can jump them and throw flyers for churches at them. The other tenth is made up of [[emo]] fucktards who listen to Rage Against the Machine and bitch about how terrible their suburban lives are. Most residents are motor sports enthusiasts who spent more [[cash]] on snowmobiles or ATVs then they did on their children's [[education]]. Yet no one owns a car, as you can take the shuttle to the rig or the mine, and there are plenty of places to tie your horse up while you get shitfaced at the saloon.
Oh, also, Barbara Cubin, Wyoming's only representative in the house, assaulted a quadriplegic who was running against her.  An interesting statistic that illustrates the mentality of the state is that 1 in every 2 farmhands will [[furry|rape]] an animal in his life.

==Tourism==

Imagine, for a second, staring across an empty void. No life, no color, just wind and boredom. Welcome to Wyoming! Please contribute to our unstable, coal and oil-based economy! Our police would be happy to give you a speeding ticket, and blackmail you on the side of the road. Remember, if you pay now, this won't go on your record!

The one good thing about Wyoming is Yellowstone National park, renowned for it's geysers, wildlife, and [[retard|tourists who dress like cowboys while there for three days]]. To the East and North, there is nothing but sagebrush and horse shit until you get to Omaha, or Canada respectively. In [[Montana|Mantana]] to the surrounding west, one will find [[Brokeback Mountain|gay cowboys]] and pine trees. To the south lies Jackson Hole and The Tetons, which the [[French]] named after [[tits]]. Jackson Hole is overrun with [[Hippy|Wholefoods shoppers]] and their [[Yuppie|Performance Fleece]] wearing river tour patrons.

==Wyoming: Entrance to Hell==

Another notable thing about Wyoming is that it is the location that [[Jeebus]] chose to put [[Hell]].
The rationale for such a conclusion is as follows:
*Devil's Tower
*Yellowstone Volcanic activity (a.k.a. THE GIANT FUCKING CALDERA THAT IS 60,000 YEARS OVERDUE TO GO APESHIT ON HALF THE CONTINENT, AND [[catnarock| KILL THE ENTIRE WORLD]])
*Devils gate
*Hell's half acre
*Mormon trail
*The city of Casper, named not after the fucking ghost, but a retarded soldier who got captured, raped, and mutilated in a battle, then Indian children spun his mutilated torso around on a frozen log for fun. AND THEY NAMED A FUCKING TOWN AFTER HIM. FUCK. There is also a town named after the only thing there, the Little America Hotel.
*They had a governor who took the skin of some dude and made it INTO FUCKING SHOES. WTF.
*Dick Cheney was born in Casper, the aforementioned city named after an [[pwnt]] soldier.
*They didn't even spell the pwnt soldier's name right when naming the the town. IT'S CASPAR FUCKTARDS, NOT CASPER. CHRIST.
* Jeez guise maybe it was named after the friendly fuckin ghost
