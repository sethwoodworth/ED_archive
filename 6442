"Consider this a warning that the video you are about to see is full of 
extreme and utter rage; rage that which I am still feeling at this very moment, and I'm trying to be calm in order to warn you: if you have children in the room, who are within good hearing distance, it is best that you don't watch this video, because I am very, very angry at this point in time, and I am very fed up, and this video will express you just how fed up I am. And, so, there's your warning. This video is NOT polite. It's not nice, and there's a lot of extreme screaming and vulgar language. And I apologize to my subscribers, but this has to stop. This has to be it. I can't do this any more. So... I'm NOT leaving YouTube. I will NOT give in. I will not. But there's your warning."

"Hey everybody. I come to you tonight VERY. FUCKING. PISSED OFF. This video is NOT going to be pleasant. If you don't like unpleasant videos I suggest you leave right now. I have kept my fucking mouth shut about this, and I'll try to be a good person about this. I've tried to move on. But they refuse to let me. You know what? So I'm gonna tell everybody what they're doin'. Wattagecat and his FUCKING PRICK MOTHERFUCKING FRIENDS keep calling my damn house. How they got my phone number is unknown to me, I don't know. BUT DON'T CALL MY FUCKING HOUSE SAYING YOU'RE THE INTERNET POLICE AGAIN!"

Because he is perfectly aware of EVERY fucking thing happenin' here right now. And he has SEEN your damn videos. And I am CURRENTLY in the process of talkin' to a lawyer. THAT'S WHY MY MOUTH STAYED SHUT, BUT DON'T YOU START THREATENIN' ME! DON'T YOU GET ON THE FUCKING TELEPHONE IN MY DAMN HOUSE, BRINGING YOUR LITTLE INTERNET SHIT TO MY FAMILY! I mean it. Leave me the fuck alone, or you WILL be in court. That is not a threat, bitch, that's a promise. THAT IS a promise. You are HARRASSING me.
