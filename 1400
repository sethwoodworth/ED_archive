[[Image:FenceSitter.jpg|thumb|right|That guy that called you an extremist for taking a side]]
'''Centrists''' are to [[liberalism|liberals]] and [[conservatism|conservatives]] what [[agnosticism|agnostics]] are to [[atheists]] and [[christian]]s, or what bisexuals are to [[fags|faggots]] and straight people. They're too lazy to form an actual opinion. Centrist think leaning slightly left or right of center makes you a [[hippie]] or [[survivalist]] [[some argue|respectively]]. However, no true centrist exists, as they will side with the [[democrats]] or [[republican]]s on at least one particular issue. [[13 year old boys|People]] usually discover that they're "centrist" when entering high school.

== In Politics ==
'''Becoming a Centrist Candidate''' happens when a [[pedophile|politician]] wants to be elected in a place where one party does not entirely [[rape|dominate]] the other, and to win a candidate must get support from both sides. A particularly lulzy example is the [[America|American]] presidential race. In the primaries, the [[Obama|Democratic]] candidate will smoke a joint, let a gang of black person fuck his wife, [[Mongo|have sex with a tree]], read bedtime stories to a glacier, and generally let all the [[hippie]] fucks, white-guilting yuppies, and ugly [[Wiccan|moon women]] stand around and cum in his mouth. The [[Republican|Republican]] presidential primary consists of each candidate being placed on the back of a Humvee with a .50 Cal at the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. The dude with the highest kill count (To be determined by [[Rush_Limbaugh|sanctioned RNC observers]]) will be awarded the candidacy. After winning the primary, while showering off [[period|blood]] and/or [[cum|semen]], the candidate shall realize that the country still contains a fair number of Those Other People. Then, two previously mighty lulzwarriors will transform into bloodless, [[Hillary_Clinton|dickless]] centrists who live in fear of offending even the [[retard|pettiest]] special interest groups.
