[http://www.lockerz.com/ Lockerz] is an attempt at wacky viral marketing and social networking. It is by far the most maligntant form of [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|cancer]] to strike the internets so far. Lockerz is a [[4chan|secret]] website that is [[SA|members only]] but can give you [[scam|lots of fun prizes for doing nothing]]! Despite what people say it is [[lie|legit]] because you can look at [[This Looks Shopped|images]] of people with their prizes! If you've logged on the internet you have no doubt heard of Lockerz, because no matter where you goâ€”from [[Neopets]] to [[Facebook]] to [[4chan]], it is impossible to escape the cancer that is Lockerz.

==4chan Before Lockerz==
[[Image:Bitches_Dont_Know_Bout_My_Spam.jpg|center|500px]]

We all remember the July 2008 Times Magazine article where [[moot]] said, "Spammers don't even bother to spam [[4chan]]"?  Well you knew he was wrong because [[Kimmo Alm]] was busy spamming [[AnonTalk.com]] there. The only thing else was [[4chan.js]] and [[Grawp]]-style posting links to vandalized Wikipedia versions, but these weren't true [[spam]] in the sense of commercial advertisements.

Before Lockerz hit, Kimmo Alm was in the lead with 50% of 4chan's posts being his spam.  Only during sporadic outbreaks from whenever 4chan.js mutated into a new form had anything exceeded Kimmo's spam, during which 4chan would get flooded so badly that over 90% of their content was infectious 4chan.js spores. So in essence, Kimmo was winning the contest of who could spam 4chan the most...

<center>'''Then Came Lockerz'''</center>

==Discovery==
[[Image:Bitches Do Know About My Spam.jpeg|center|500px]]

No one knows when it first hit, only a short while ago we can recall hearing about Lockerz once or twice a week. The website was still in beta so no one knew what has happening, it was invite only so everyone wanted to see what it was... '''Then the shit hit the fan'''.

It may not have started at 4chan first, internet scientists are working furiously to discover which regions of the internet were first hit by Free Lockerz Invitations ([[AIDS|FLI]]). Any message board had at least one thread from one gullible moron trying to get people to accept his invitations, as time went on many more appeared. Like the lazy crackwhore that 4chan is, sleeping around with other websites bringing back [[cum|content]] and [[AIDS|stds]] it brought back another disease. Unlike most this could not be cured by s simple shot of penicillin, it was worse, it was... [[fail|terminal]].

==The First Patients==
[[Image:Lockerzshit.jpg|thumb|If, of course, the mods aren't lube deep in a CP thread.]]
All the sudden it was impossible to refresh a page on /b/ without seeing a thread for invites to this horrid site. People posted the thread in their own ways, no unity was found in the posts. In simple terms, this was not the spam bot 4chan is used to, it was worse. A legion of [[retard|retarded]] teenagers flooded the boards all asking for people to accept their invites to get points for [[shit|fabulous prizes]]! This was at first small and not that big of a problem, sure it's annoying but not near as fast as a spambot. It was fine for a short while..

==The Cancer Goes Malignant==
It seemed fine at first with only a few spammers, things were good. The deadly part about Lockerz is that it grows just like [[AIDS]]. The website operates as a [[spam|pyramid scam]], the more members you invite the better things you get. One [[newfag]] invites another, those two invite two others, those four invite four others, eight newfags, sixteen newfags, thirty two newfags, and on and on until we get in the thousands. The [[300|few]] spammers we could put up with were now a full fledged force. The mods like snipers could pick off a few but not the full onslaught, worse yet there was no [[brb, soup|soup]] to be had.

==The Cancer Kills AIDS==
If you've been reading AnonTalk's bulletins, you'll hear Kimmo complaining all the time about how his traffic keeps going away.  This is where it is going.  His [[spambot]] can't keep up with the spambots funded by Lockerz.com's billionaire CEO.

[[Image:Hit-refresh-on-4chan-frontpage-and-every-single-time-you-will-see-lockerz-spam.png|thumb|350px|left|Hit refresh on 4chan's frontpage. Now, every single time you will see lockerz spam!  Usually, it's multiple times.]]

According to people who have actually gone into the site, it's some kind of [[:Image:Pyramid scheme.jpg|pyramid scheme]] and they sell all your personal information to advertisers and identity thieves.  Lockerz will only describe itself in vague, [[scam]]mer terms like, "Lockerz.com is a brand new site that rewards you for just about everything you do.  You can earn points in 3 ways: 1. Logging in each day. 2. Answering the question of the day. 3. Referring new members."  And they claim you can them redeem the points for prizes like [[ipod]]s, which [[Mitchell Henderson|some people of generation Z]] would kill themselves to get.

Lockerz itself has gotten so bad, not only does it spam all of [[4chan]], but it even has flooded every single part of the internet with spam, even [[AnonTalk]] and AnotherTalk.

==Intelligence of Lockerz Members==
The intelligence of Lockerz members is believed to be [[Retard|quite low]]. As well as a contribution to the [[Cancer_that_is_killing_/b/|cancer]], Lockerz members have also made themselves known for their lack of knowledge, which you can see in the following quotes from some of Lockerz's more intellectually superior members:

{{quote|fuck u lockerz| Garland Li}}

{{quote|liar!!| Kevin Franka}}

{{quote|I hate when I aren't even able to redeem.| Brock Berlin}}

{{quote|WTFFF thts SCAm bitches i couldnt even able to reedem it just keep sayin ur not in this wave wtffffff!! lockerz sucks| Haris Shaikh}}

These are just some of the quotes from Lockerz members, who spent days spamming /b/ with their referral shit, praising their favorite website.

==How Lockerz.com actually works==
Lockerz is explained [http://scams.wikispaces.com/Matrix+Schemes here] in full detail.  It is a Matrix Scheme, a form of pyramid scheme.

To quote http://scams.wikispaces.com/Matrix+Schemes
{{quote3|Some variations do not require the victim to spend money but instead they must sign up friends and then take part in a marketing survey or trial a product such as a credit card. www.ipods.freepay.com is an example of such a site. In theory, the victim and their eight friends must all complete the trial to get the IPOD. In order for the first victim to get the IPOD, 64 people are signed up for the program.

As well as signing up friends, the victim may also have to

*Paying shipping on the item.
*Allow personal information to be resold to marketing companies
*Send tax information to claim the value of the prize. This contains further personal information that is resold.
*Trial a 'free' credit card, membership or subscription for 30 days. If they do not cancel it in time in exactly the correct way, they are charged for the service.}}

That is how Lockerz works...

Lockerz invites all members to answer a "daily", a question of the day, if you will. Likely they just collect all their data from [[you|mouthbreathing idiots]] and sell it. Obvious, you say? Well, Lockerz requires name, age, etc. when signing up, so your moronic response is highly marketable info to say, a fitness company who wants to sell shit to nerdy faggots who 
* live in a certain area
* are xx years old
* are of x race
That's probably how their billionaire CEO gets away with this without ruining her good name; and yes, she is a [[whore|woman]].

==Lockerz gets botted==

After Lockerz.com infected the internet, people started to make hackzz and cheat it on websites like Mango 12 and http://www.tubbynetwork.net.tc . These idiots only made the Lockerz infection worse with their skiddy coding skillz.
