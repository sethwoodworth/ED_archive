Fallacious reasoning
'''Fallacious reasoning''' (or spurious correlation if you're a [[shit no one cares about|sociology]] faggot) is present in almost all IRC [[Dubious_disclaimer|'debates']].
[[Image:Dumbconservatard.jpg|thumb|Typical logical fallacy]]
It is also widely used by [[Children]]. It comes from [[Greek]]: ''reasoning'' = logos, ''fallacious'' = of or relating to [[phallus]].
Here are a few timeless examples to get you started
*Trees move when the wind blows, therefore trees must cause the wind.

*People [[an_hero|kill]] other [[fags|people]] with guns. [[You|People]] will stop killing each other   if [[nazi|we take away their guns.]]

*People will get mad at one another and be [[stupid]] with or without their firearms, so removing their firearms will make no difference whatever to the rate at which people kill each other.

*Many [[heroin]] users started with [[marijuana]]. If we get rid of marijuana, people will stop using heroin.

*Joan Collins is famous, she's fucked a lot of people, she must be attractive/[[list of sex moves|good in bed]]

*[[obesity|McDonald's]] is everywhere, a lot of people eat there, it must be a good place to eat.

*This [[dog]] keeps [[teabagging|sniffing my crotch]], it must be in heat, I should [[Dogmongler|have sex with it]]

*I have no friends.  I also own a [[hugbox]].  Therefore, I must have the [[Asperger's_Syndrome|ass burgers]].

*She's bleeding, she must be [[16-year-old girl|old enough]]
