Spider expert
The term 'spider expert' is synonymous with the term '[[faggot]]', due to a [[wordfilter]] on [[7chan]] turning the latter into the former. Nobody really thinks that this is [[lulz|lawlzy]], but it has changed meaning and is regularly usable as an insult on the internet. Due to the confusion of the wordfilter, and the general douchebaggery of 7chan patrons, the term became an insult used against people who know too much about a subject nobody cares about ([[spiders]],[[politics]],[[MCR]]), or used by a person in a losing argument as a last ditch attempt to insult the victor.

Example:

"you could always make a citizen's arrest or something"

"Actually police do not recommend people make citizen's arrest due to the fact it is dangerous and makes you subject to all kinds of liabilities..."

"....fuck you, spider expert."
