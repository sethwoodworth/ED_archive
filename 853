'''[[fag|Barney (Frank)]]  and [[Nancy Pelosi|Friends]]''' is a television show that came from the [[internets|realms]] of [[YouTube|horrible T.V.]] In the 90's, no [[Littlekuriboh|other children's television show]] was as [[troll|hated and reviled]] as Barney. In fact, if you wanted to [[troll|torture]] someone to [[300|madness]] and [[an hero|beyond]], you would [[Josef Fritzl|lock them in a room]] and play nothing but "Barney the [[Lemonparty|Dinosaur]]". 

The main character, [[fag|Barney]] was an [[furry|anthropomorphic]] purple T-Rex that had been [[castration|neutered]] and [[retard|lobotomized]] and made into a [[pussy]] [[PETA|vegan]] slave to [[politically correct]] America. As such, [[fag|Barney]] performed simple song and dance in order to teach children how to eat shit and how to rape [[furry]] animals at will.  

Barney's [[Shit nobody cares about|general theme]] was [[troll|driving]] adults to drink and [[basement dweller|plot ways to murder a dinosaur]]. 

It was also ranked on TV Guide's List of the 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time at #50. [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/07/12/entertainment/main515057.shtml Seriously.]

==Lack of [[Bill Nye|Educational Value]]==

{{quote|[H]is shows do not assist children in learning to deal with negative feelings and emotions. As one commentator puts it, the real danger from Barney is denial: the refusal to recognize the existence of unpleasant realities. For along with his steady diet of giggles and unconditional love, Barney offers our children an one-dimensional world where everyone must be happy and everything must be resolved right away.|Some commentator; apparently, Barney makes kids go into [[denial]].}}

It is now known that the true purpose of Barney was to [[crap|produce]] [[leftard|brain dead morons]]  who couldn't think for themselves and be [[pansy|spineless pussies]]. Many commented that the show lacked any [[Bill Nye|educational value]] or [[porn|substantive, positive content]] which only [[haters|added to the hatred]] for the show. Not to mention Barney walked around in a purple costume, which is completely [[Gay|straight]]. 
And remember kids:

==Barney in [[b|Modern Culture]]==
It is safe to say that Barney is [[Chris-Chan|THE most hatable thing]] in [[MTV|pop culture]].

Songs were conceived [[Islam|calling for his death]], comics were drawn showing him [[an hero|dying horribly]], [[Animaniacs]] [[troll|mocked]] him as [[Xenu|a cosmic horror]] known as "[[bullshit|Baloney]]", and one mascot [[basement dweller|made up an entire act]] [[win|beating up another mascot in a Barney suit]]. 

If [[4chan]] was up and about in the 90s, Barney bashing would have its own forum with a steady stream of anti-Barney memes coming out on an hourly basis.

However, 4chan was not necessary in the days when Barney & Friends was at its peak popularity. The interbuttz responded naturally to such an abomination, spawning the [[Usenet]] newsgroup "alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die", which was geared to the satirization, defamation and denouncement of Barney in any and all forms, even spawning a "roleplay" world in which members of the group would take on paramilitary personae, equipping themselves with such hardware as "Anti-Barney MechWarrior Units" and other assorted battle gear to defeat the rising tide of "Barneyism".

TL;DR: Barney was hated even in the days of "milk and honey" interbuttz, and the net as a whole rose to combat him.
* "I love you, you love me, let's hang Barney from a tree.."
* "I love you, you love me, ho-mo-se-xu-al-i-ty..."
* "I love you, you love me, pe-do-phile, dontcha see?"
* and "A great big slug, for me to send you too, won't you say I HATE YOU TOO?"

===Barney Torture===
Barney is well-known for having the worst song in fucking existence. Just try and listen to it without wanting to jab a pencil through your ear canals:

This song is also one of the six songs used for [[troll|torturing]] people.[http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs//archives/27123] That's right kids. Your government repeatedly plays this song to [[Arabs|camel jockeys]] in order to get them to beg for mercy. The good folks over at Guantanamo Bay like to use it as an interrogation technique, or maybe they just like to fuck with dirty sand [[niggers]]. Whatever the case, they apparently played it so much, that it has gained the title of "the most overused song in the U.S. interrogator’s arsenal."

{{quote|Interrogators at Guantanamo Bay... used the sappy kids’ show theme song as “futility music” to convince detainees of the futility of maintaining their silence. One United Kingdom human rights group protested President George W. Bush’s visit to England by blasting the song in his general direction.|In his general direction}}

PROTIP: Mic-spam these songs in any video game with mic chat and then you'll have the entire server to yourself in no time at all.

ANOTHER PROTIP: B'harni heads a cult, he's the main leader and puts all his members into a hypnotic trance.
