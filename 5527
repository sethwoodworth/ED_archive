===BAWWWW===

A dramatic drop in support for Mubarak occurred with the news that his son Alaa was favoured in government tenders and privatization. With both of his sons directly and indirectly owning shares in a large number of companies and minor projects, Mubarak's corruption is leading a series of corruption cases among his cabinet of minor governmental employees.

While in office, political corruption in the Mubarak administration's Ministry of Interior has risen dramatically, due to the increased power over the institutional system that is necessary to secure the prolonged presidency. Such corruption has led to the frequent imprisonment of political figures and young activists without trials, illegal undocumented hidden detention facilities, and rejecting universities, mosques, newspapers staff members based on political inclination. On a personnel level, each individual officer can and will violate citizens' privacy in his area, using unconditioned arrests, common torture and abuse of power, depending on simply brute force, rather than law, to enforce order in the officer's designated area. This has resulted in the common belief that "A policeman is more dangerous than a criminal".

The rise to power of powerful business men in the National Democratic Party (Egypt) in the federal government and People's Assembly led to massive waves of anger during the years of Ahmed Nazif's government.  As a result, frequent laws and bills are passed, with undergiant monopolists (such as Ahmed Ezz's)influence serving personal and corporational financial interests rather than public's. 
Transparency International (TI) is an international organisation addressing corruption, including, but not limited to, political corruption.  In 2008, TI's Corruption Perceptions Index report assessed Egypt with a CPI score of 2.8, based on perceptions of the degree of corruption from business people and country analysts, with 10 being highly clean and 0 being highly corrupt. Egypt ranked 115th out of the 180 countries included in the report.

Furthermore president Mubarak has succeeded in taking over the election process , which has enabled him to remain in the position for a life time and to eliminate any kind of refusal even before arousing. Though the Egyptian people are against the rule of Mubarak , he continues to reign over all the facilities that could enable democracy to flow. Also, Mubarak has lately introduced his son Gamal into the political field in order to prepare him to be his succesor in the rule over Egypt.
