'''blogTV''' is [[THE BEST]] [[camwhore|cam whore]] site [[you]] could go to find high levels of [[unwarranted self-importance]] or [[troll]]s. Established in June [[2007]], "''Blog''" is a social broadcasting and [[stickam]] ripoff where [[pedobear]]s, [[troll]]s and epic [[phail]]ures go to find [[Jew gold]]. To reiterate "Blog" (as the cool kids call it) is where [[troll]]s go to [[troll]], and freakin' [[party hard]]. "The [[broadcaster]] can broadcast to its audience with a web cam" according to [[TOW]]; and basically no gives a shit because of all the [[advertising]]. The platform also includes a [[teenchat]] system, and crappy [[moderator]]s. The site has a promotional partnership with [[ICQ]] which is an [[IM]] type platform that still exists apparently. It is [[notable]] for a high level of [[anti-lulz]], [[fap]] [[emoticon]] and [[unfunny]] material.

== Blogtv Junior ==
[[Last Thursday]] the admins on Blogtv noticed an [[over 9000|abundance]] of [[pedophiles]] hanging out at the broadcasts of little boys.  So they decided to raise the age limit from [[13 year old boys|13]] to [[16 year old girls|16]], resulting in lots of [[butthurt|bitching]].  During this time [[over 9000]] petitions were formed, and since there was no organized fight, it [[fail|failed.]]  Eventually blogtv got tired of all the emails from [[13 year old boys|all of the faggots]] and came up with a [[retarded|TOTALLY AWSUM SOLUTION!!1!11!!!]]  And created the jr section for kids aged 13-15.  What they didn't realize is the [[pedophile|pedos]] would just make jr accounts and go [[fap]] to the [[13 year old boys|kids anyway.]] 

Junior accounts are extremly hard to troll.

1. Become a kid.

2. Use tinyurl and put your video in in.

3. Pick random broadcast.

4. Ask if they wanna see your funny new video (a lot of the time some [[clever]] little [[viewer]] will say DON'T CLICK @!!11!on! !!!!11 !! just tell them to stfu and it's fine.)

5. If you get kicked, delete your account.

6. Little [[broadcaster]] kicks you out,[[lemon party| you are gone]], [[Fag|show carries on]].

7. [[????]]

8. [[PROFIT!]]

== Raids on BlogTV ==
Raids on BlogTV have been a increasingly practiced pastime for [[Anonymous|anons]], and they have not failed to include there fair share of [[win]]. A tactic of befriending the host, asking to Co-host the show, then if she/he agrees to let you Co-host there show, put as much [[offended|offensive]] material as possible on the screen before the host declines the show, Is a quite popular tactic.

Other methods include posting [[offended|offensive]] material and immediately logging out (preventing bans or kicks) and creating new guest accounts whenever kicked by disabling [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html Flash Cookies]

Finally for camwhores add this to your profile/The Playground 

<EMBED SRC="http://www.swfcabin.com/swf-files/1281051415.swf" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1> 

Before adding this, run no-script for Firefox, so you don't get last measured [[rape|yourself]].

And tell them to view your profile its [[Last Measure]]

== Youtubers ==
[[at least 100|Once upon a time]] all of the [[youtube super fags|youtubers]] deemed blogtv as the [[cool]] place to have all their [[fantard|fangirls and fanboys]] come and watch them talk about [[shit nobody cares about|their opinions, their day, and just have a grand ol' time.]]

[[youtube super fags|Youtubers]] and Blogtv had a great relationship until the summer of 2009, when most of them moved to Ustream.  Bigger youtubers such as [[sxephil]], [[dfizzy]] [[Shane Dawson]], and every other youtuber that followed suit all claim it [[stfu|has better quality and the twitter feed is cooler than blogtv's.]] But really it just doesn't pay enough and doesn't automatically feature the [[usi|gods of youtube the second they grace blogtv with their presence]].  In this recording[http://www.blogtv.com/shows/197407/ZeNwb2_waeZDYeVFYX&pos=ancr] [[dfizzy]] talks about how he is leaving blogtv FOREVVER D:< even though he came back.

Now a [[over 9000|majority]] of [[youtube super fags|youtubers]] broadcast on Ustream.  BlogTV is still used by retards like [[TheAmazingAtheist]] and [[MannixThePirate]], though.

==blogTV, The Future of Entertainment?==

{{quote|I've given BlogTV an honest try. At first it was [[pretty cool guy|pretty cool]]. And then it happened, utter shit. All of the [[op|ops]] there are whining [[butthurt]] fags who'll kick you the second you question the leadership. It's a fucking circle-jerk of camwhores.|Stevaloosaurus, falling for the [[faggotry|trap]].}}
