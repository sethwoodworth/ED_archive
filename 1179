Broady Paul Ledet
{{anotherhero}}

'''Broady Paul Ledet''' is the newest, albeit least recognized [[an hero]] ever. Rather than having lost an iPod or perhaps being bullied at school, this particular [[emo]] [[fag|faggot]] decided that he would steal his mother's truck for a joyride. In the process, our subject successfully totaled the truck by wrapping it around a tree. Distraught and horrified, Ledet pulled a [[Chris Benoit]], and after destroying something that someone held dear, proceeded to [[permaban]] himself from life.
