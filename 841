Banned
[[File:You_are_banned_cunt.jpg|thumb|Indeed you are.]]

You’ve done something [[stupid]]. Perhaps you have pissed off other members; posted something that was prohibited or just acted fucking stupid. You think that you’re invincible; NOTHING can stop you from having this much fun. [[Divide by zero|Oh shit]]. An admin just saw what you did. And what happens? You were just '''banned'''. You are now unable to do what was fun, can’t post anymore and can’t access pages that you used to prior to being banned. And even worse; you deserved it. Shame on you. <font color=red>'''(USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)'''</font>

==Banhammer==

[[Image:Ban_hammer.jpg|thumb|right|120px|An [[IRL]] Ban [[Hammer]] in the hands of some emaciated [[azn]] [[bitch]]. Bonus: The hammer says "[[In the ass|Insert rectally]]".]]

The '''banhammer''', (historically referred to as '''''B&jolnir''''') forged in the flames of Lolhalla, is the ultimate weapon against the [[unfunny]] and all breeds of [[vandal]]. It should only be wielded by the [[Jesus|righteous]] - its true powers are only accessible by those who descend from [[Trolldin]] to champion the causes of the meek.

The bane of [[faggot]]s and the [[unfunny]] everywhere ([[PaigeGirl]], we're looking at you).
The banhammer is also something [[you]] are going to get. Yay!

When someone posts something [[unfunny]], you may choose one of <del>three</del> four options:

* Read their post in a [[Fred|high-pitched voice]]. This requires a microphone.
* Post "get [[banned]] faggot".
* [[DSFARGEG]]
* Upload [[facepalm|Captain Picard]].

All of these increase your [[e-penis]] size by about the same amount.

==Banset==

So you like to go onto chatrooms and/or forums and check to see how many little boys are looking for lovin' from a 43 year old who still lives with his mother. Chances are you are going to get B& or end up in front of [[Chris Hansen|this charming young gent]].

A command executed in the [[LiveJournal]] admin console in the form of "ban_set username," wherein username identifies the LJ user one wishes to ban.  Banning prevents a person from commenting in a journal; after the [[serial adder]] craze post-[[invite code]], it also removed a person from the "friend-of" list of the banner.

Additionally, the maintainers of a [[community]] can use "ban_set username from communityname" to block a user from joining or commenting in that community like this idiot [http://img131.imageshack.us/my.php?image=bannedce9.jpg here].

A meme in which various users post a list of people to ban from their journals for some reason or another.

*[http://www.livejournal.com/users/____prfctlj4evr/551.html prfctlj4evr] and [http://www.livejournal.com/users/___prfctlj4evr2/616.html?nc=21 prfctlj4evr2] ban lists as shown by [[furries]]. This list appears to be a [[cuntpaste|copy/paste]] of [[jameth]]'s friendslist and [[girlvinyl]]'s friendslist.

*[http://www.livejournal.com/users/bandefurz/522.html List of Banned furries] in retaliation to the above.
The ban set command is often used at the LiveJournal community ONTD because the mods suck.

==Permaban==
[[Image:Permaban ltd.gif|left]]The ultimate in message board and LJ [[pwnage]]. To be perma-banned is to be ''permanently [[ban]]ned'', usually from a channel in [[IRC]] or some other access-restrictable resource on the [[internets]]. Permbans are virtual decapitations - you managed to do something so monumentally [[stupid]] that the site's [[admin]] decided to actually go to the trouble of making sure that you never, ever have access to their little domain ever again. They rolled up the clubhouse's ladder, changed the secret password, and probably even told all their [[OL]] [[friend]]s that you are nothing but a big [[poop]]y head.

[[Image:Inspirational_poster_-_BAN.jpg|thumb|Inspirational poster for moderators.]]
[[File:Uno_Flasher.png|thumb|Mom, "Why was my son banned without notification?"  Admin, "Your son was banned for exposing himself on camera."]]
Unfortunately, real permabans are extremely rare on the [[internets]]. The stupid, irrational and humorless (that's 90% of the internet population) will treat any IP [[ban]], account [[ban]], email address [[ban]] or any other form of access restriction as the epitome of [[internet]] justice while remaining oblivious and ignorant to the fact that such bans are negated within seconds. Should a [[troll]] be banned from a certain place and has the will to continue to disrupt that place's regular actions, he will dodge the "[[ban]]" in a minute. Such [[Computer Science III|knowledge]] of [[ban]]-dodging is well-hidden within most trolling organizations' archives and are never revealed to the public, for the stupid, irrational and humorless will perceive such knowledge as an [[a plus|A+]] way to [[pwn]] the [[internets]]. However, that is not perceived the same way by the [[troll]], who considers ban-dodging a perfectly legitimate way to continue his actions.

===How to get banned===

* Post [[CP]]
* [[Spam]].
* Be a [[newfag]].
* If [[System 32]] is still on your computer, you will be banned.
* Using a [[Wordfilter|banned word/phrase]]. For example, starting a thread on /b/ with the phrase "[[Prove me wrong]]." (3 day ban, reason-"Prove me wrong...Bullshit")

True permabans, as opposed to false permabans, occur on those places a person cannot regain access to without doing something as [[mundane]] as changing their IP or registering a new account. Such bans are most common in online games where a CD-key, an account or something else that costs [[RL]] money is at risk. Therefore, all [[Something Awful]] forum bans are indeed true permabans unless someone wants to give [[Lowtax]] another ten dollars so he can get laid with an AIDS-infected male prostitute.

Note: When you dodge a [[ban]], a particularly stupid admin may think you're a [[hacker]]. True story.

The following are examples of [[IRL]] permabans.

*[[Hitler]] perma-banned the [[Jews]] from non-concentrated [[Germany]], and in most cases, also from [[death|life]].
*A sting ray perma-banned [[Steve Irwin]] [[for the lulz]].
*[[Tookie Williams]] was perma-banned because [[douchebag]] [[Hipster]]/[[Hippies]] liked him too much.
*[[Raptor Jesus]] is said to perma-ban all [[Fags|sinners]] from [[Pr0n|heaven]] on the [[rapture]].
*[[AIDS]] has been very prolific [[IRL]] admin, and an [[asshole]] at that; [[AIDS]] is said to have perma-banned [[over 9000]] people.  Mostly [[gays]].
*Not all admins single out others however, [[an heroes]] oftentimes perma-ban themselves.  But this is just because [[Ripper|they told you they were hardcore]].
*[[George Carlin]] spent his life [[trolling]] the [[God|admin]], and was finally permabanned on June 22, 2008.
*[[Christopher Reeve]] was perma-banned from walking and polo, likely due to his involvement in [[Superman]] III, and his association with [[Tubgirl]]

==Banned [[IRL]]==

[[Image:PigSlopDead.jpg|thumb|Joined the [[ban set]]]]
[[Image:Dead_jew_children.jpg|thumb|Two [[jews]] getting banned old school]]

'''Banned IRL''' is the process of being denied interaction with the [[Real World]] by an appropriate agent. It is, naturally, akin to being Banned [[OL]] minus the option of a [[China]]man's chance in [[Arbchat]]. [[God]] is indeed a cruel and unforgiving [[sysop]], even worse than [[ODB]] on a bender.

Being Banned IRL most commonly refers to the [[death]] or destruction of a person or object, an act designed to put themselves and the world at large out of the misery of having to interact with them. Since banning is a deliberate act the epithet is best used when said death was [[asking for it|deserved]] and done with impunity, such as during the [[holocaust]]. People known as [[internet killers]] combine both IRL and OL pwnage into a curious meta-banning process that requires [[Timecube|non-linear time]] to properly calculate the significance of.

Those who have been [[V&]] for IRL crimes and/or [[faggotry]] can also be considered having been subject to an IRL ban. However, instead of [[300|dining in hell]], these individuals go directly to [[jail]], and therefore do not pass go and do not collect $200. They're essentially [[basement dweller]]s with forced [[lurk]]er status and a black person with a 12-inch heat-seeking [[dong]] for a roommate. They also get free [[TV|HBO]].

The only individual who has ever allegedly repealed an IRL ban was [[Jesus]], and even then it was only because [[Hitler|his dad]] runs the fucking server.

The following are perfect examples of those who were banned in real life.

*[[Holocaust|The Jews]] for [[money]]. '''Ban Method''': [[Delete fucking everything]]
*[[9/11|WTC]] for being [[The Man]]. '''Ban Method''': [[airplane]]
*[[Afghanistan]] for [[Moderator|banning WTC]]. '''Ban Method''': [[Kill it with fire]]
*[[Dumbledore]] for killing [[lulz]]. '''Ban Method''': [[Shoop Da Whoop]]
*[[Bill Clinton]] for [[lolicon]]. '''Ban Method''': impeachment
*[[Ron Mexico]] for being a [[sick fuck]]. '''Ban Method''': [[Jail]]
*[[Kenny Glenn]] for being an [[animal abuse|animal abuser]]. The [[sick fuck|fucker]]. '''Ban Method''': [[Party Van]]
*[[Josef Fritzl]] for being [[holy shit|one crazy mother fucker]]. '''Ban Method''': [[v&]].
*[[Megan Meier]] for being [[retarded]]. '''Ban Method''': [[Myspace]] to [[an hero]]
*[[Abraham Lincoln]] for freeing the [[niggers|slaves]]. '''Ban Method''': [[pwnt|Murder]] 
*[[You]] for being a general [[dick]]. '''Ban Method''': [[GTFO]]

==Please Unban==
[[File:Donotb&edplz.jpg|thumb|This method is best used on [[furries]].]]
Please Unban, or "'''Please, unban me!'''" is a commonly heard phrase [[OTI]] and [[Xat]], most often heard on [[ED]] and in [[IRC]]. Once a user has been banned for [[faggotry]], a flood of sadface and PLZ UNBANS will cascade across a [[sysop|moderator]]'s screen. More often than not the [[fail|soft hearted]] [[MONUMENTAL MORON|faggot weilding a banhammer]] will comply with the request, thus letting [[fail]] and [[AIDS]] run rampant in their community.
 
While the pathetic nature of this feeble, impotent, grammatically flawed statement may appeal to the sentiments of [[Wikipedo]]s, ED sysops do not sympathize with weakness. They may well choose to strike you a second time with the [[banhammer]] out of spite... And of course, [[for the lulz]]. [[13 year old boy|Whining]] for an unban will not get you unbanned on [[ED]]. [[Get on irc fgt|Getting on IRC]] and sorting out the mess however, might.

"Please unban" is the most common sentence used in a [[ban appeal]], and is [[99.9%]] ineffective. Begging will get you nowhere, but [[ass]] kissing certainly will. [[Me_too-er|Sucking up]] to any potentially friendly mod/op is a surefire way to get right back in, should you act [[USI|the fool]].

==Ban Appeal==

Ban appeals are the biggest source of [[lulz]] for admins and [[mods]] since time began. After you have been banned, generally for falling for the [[/b/]]tards favorite of "eval", you get a chance to tell the mods on [[4chan]] (who don't give a fuck) why you should be unbanned. Generally anything over 4 characters will result in a [[tl;dr]] response.

Take these simple steps on how to appeal your ban properly.

#Offer to send [[CP]] to the mod if they unban you
#Link to free and never before seen [[porn|porn]]
#Create a new word, ie: "Shhhlongdongler"
#Threaten to be [[an hero]]

These steps, however, are the exact opposite of what to do in order to appeal your ban.

#Give a genuine reason for why you deserve to be unbanned
#Type [[moar]] than 4 characters
#Call [[moot]] a faggot
#Challenge the mod to a [[Yu-Gi-Oh|duel]]

If however, you get banned on ED. You can [[kittens|click here to appeal your ban]].
