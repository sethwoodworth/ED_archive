Gek
Ex-boyfriend of [[Hepkitten]].  Frequently mistaken in gossipy conversation for [[Gweeds]], [[Hepkitten]]'s previous boyfriend.

<blockquote>
<Fahrvergnugen> shit who was [[hepkitten]]'s boyfriend before gek?<br>
<[[twid]]> [[gweeds]]!<br>
<[[twid]]> you know, back when [[hepkitten]] was a [[hacker]] and went to [[defcon]]s<br>
<[[twid]]> now she's a political activist and is in the [[black bloc]]!<br>

It is rumored that Gek maades [[Hepkitten]] cry far less often than [[Gweeds]] did.  There are conflicting opinions as to whether or not this was a good thing. 

Gek is basically a horrible person, and is also something of a tit when politics come up.  This would be fine if he were not really into talking about politics.

Despite his ex-partner's close association with the community, Gek was not an active member of [[LiveJournal]].  Aside from the odd comment posted in someone else's journal, he appears to want little to do with it.

Gek is actively involved with [[Indymedia]].  As one might imagine, Gek is also quite self-important.

During [[Insub]]'s lifespan, Gek seemed to have a preternatural ability to sense political discussion.  His infrequent visits to the channel were seemingly timed so as to completely fuck up any even semi-rational discussion of a political nature.  This was probably mostly [[Hepkitten]]'s fault.  Conversations that began life when people of like political mind agreed with one another vehemently and passionately would, without fail, escalate into Gekbaiting as soon as he signed on.  Unfazed and seemingly unaware of his reputation as a twat, Gek eventually stopped signing into #[[insub]] because everyone was always mean to him.

Sometime in between November 2005 and January 2006 [[Weev]] did Gek the favor of telling him how big a slut [[Hepkitten]] had been at Defcon, sucking like 100 dicks including the gay disease infested dong of [[Oclet]]. Gek still hates Weev for it, to this day. Hepkitten called Weev crying afterwards because Gek took her shell account on linenoise.org and banned her from Indymedia which was "the only thing she ever enjoyed <strike>doing</strike>spying upon".

In July 2006 Gek [[ruination|self-ruined]] by doing lots of crack and disappearing off the face of the earth, leaving a sweet shepard mix named Bruno to starve in an empty house. Gek is now universally hated the world over, even by the animals he once use to be an activist for.

Gek is Dutch for crazy.
