Veteran
A '''veteran''' is someone who believes they are accomplishing something of significance by dedicating a considerable part of their life to posting on the same [[forum|message board]]. This title is usually[[unwarranted self-importance| self-appointed]].

== [[What]] ==

[[Image:Stephen_Hawking_StarChild.jpg‎|thumb|This man has spent so long on the computer, Veterans' Syndrome has taken over his spine.]] 

Generally, veterans are [[pedophiles|men in their twenties]] who spend a few hours daily [[stalking|talking to 14 year old boys]] on the internet. They explain themselves by saying they [[lie|were that age when they started posting,]] but THAT'S NO FUCKING EXCUSE.

The name "veteran" [[Etymology|comes from]] the military term, insinuating [[basement dwellers|veterans]] have something in common with actual soldiers who have gone off to [[war]], killed people, formed relationships with real life people, and gotten laid. They feel that experiencing years of [[flamewar]]s has left them jaded and emotionally stale, like some shell-shocked [[Gitmo|POW]]. No, they're just [[aspie|social reject]]s. And [[Brandon Crisp|COD]] doesn't count, pussies.

[[Image:Forum comic.jpg|thumb|How to become a veteran.]]

It is for the prior mentioned reasons that veterans perpetually moan about [[obvious|how everyone talks about lame childish things]], whereas back in the day [[bullshit|all the conversation amongst little kids was hilarious and enlightening]]. Whenever a veteran starts [[BAWWWWWW|moaning]], the only correct response is to tell them to [[gtfo|leave]], since they're [[Infantilism|clinging on to something they've long ago grown out of]].

It is a fundamental [[rules of the internet|law of the internet]] that most [[noobs]] will never achieve the glory of being a veteran, and they should be pleased about it. Many strive to one day become one, but most will realize that they've been [[masturbation|wasting time and energy]] that would be better put to use [[sex|writing love poems to girls]] or going outside. For striving to become a veteran is the worst [[addiction]] a person could ever get; more hours than the average [[Amy Winehouse|crackhead]] spends stealing stereos and smoking [[drugs|baking soda]] wasted on something nowhere near as entertaining. 

But once a person has spent enough hours every day for enough years to claim the title of 'veteran', they will wield it like an iron glove, deciding that they must be [[shit|the shit]] because [[unwarranted self-importance|the internet thinks they're cool]]. If only they invested as heavily in [[real life]] interests.

For the veteran, the internet truly is [[serious business]]. They will rarely have girlfriends. When they do, they will see a real [[vag|sexual relationship]] as a purpose to brag to their e-peers and at least feel a feeling above worthlessness. Veterans thrive by [[circular logic|posting on a forum that thinks they're awesome because they've posted on it before]].

[[Some argue]] that Veterans' Syndrome is even more debilitating than its close cousin, [[Cancer|Gulf War Syndrome]]. This is due to its ability to turn [[intelligent]], [[cool|popular]], [[happycat|precocious]] [[13 year old boy|young teenagers]] into [[fat|obese]], [[fugly|ugly]], [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] [[Chris Forcand|perverts]].

[[Image:Standards.jpg|thumb|This advanced case of Veterans' Syndrome has invaded the subject's [[Balls|testes]].]] 

Since most veterans don't actually like the board they're posting on, it can only be assumed that many of them have [[CP|ulterior motives]].

Some veterans may suffer from some element of [[OCD]], especially if they also compulsively visit websites like [[Nationstates]] and [[Forumwarz]], which similarly trap their members in an endless feedback loop of disappointment. If someone revisits these repetitive websites for longer than a couple of weeks, they obviously get some cheap thrill from participating in dull activities for hours at a time. The internet thrives on [[Mrfetch|this kind of person]]. 

Other veterans may harbor some secret desire to attain [[moderator|modship]]. No-one particularly knows why anyone would want to be a mod; perhaps to heighten their [[ego]], already bruised by girls and employers, or perhaps so they can fall deeper into their [[fantasy]] life where they are the Noob-[[pwn]]er and everyone else quakes at their sight.

As was previously mentioned, there is a high probability of the average veteran being a child molester, with the joyful [[faggotry|gaiety]] of teenage internet forums reminding them of showering after sports in high school.

Most veterans are a combination of all of the above.

== How to Salute ==

[[image:Two girl blowjob.jpg|thumb|Get to work, noobs, or you'll never be e-popular!]]

There are two ways veterans are regularly treated. The first is [[fellatio|overt praise]], where [[fags|other users]] will suck up to them, hoping that they can become [[bff|internet pals]] and the veteran can be called upon in arguments like some [[Pear Chan|giant lumbering monster]]. A well-known veteran will be treated in exactly the same obnoxious way as [[moderators]] are - [[wet and messy fetishism|brown-nosed]] to the point of constipation.

The other way to treat a veteran is like the [[pathetic]] user [[you|they]] are, flaming them at every move and trying to step on their toes. Because for a veteran to quote one of your posts would be [[orgasm|bliss]], such flaming betrays a desperate wish for them to notice you. So you're just as much of an [[attention whore]] as the veterans and those kissing their ass.

[[Tldr]]; [[offended|fuck you]].


== How to [[Troll]] ==

[[image:gruesome.gif|thumb|Internet veterans]]

* Ask them how the [[unemployed|job hunt]] is going.
* Ask them how the [[virgin|sex life]] is going.
* Ask them how the [[real life]] is going.
* Ask them how their [[second life]] is going.
* Tell them to leave if they don't like the place.
* Tell them they're a [[faggot]] for liking the place so much.
* Ask them whether they know [[old meme|All Your Base]].
* Show them any element of disrespect and [[Rape|take them by surprise]].
* Put them down in a witty manner with a noob account.
* Google their alias followed by the word "[[fetish]]" and blackmail them on [[Facebook]].
* Gravedig their old threads (if the forum allows it) or bring up the first threads they posted when they were n00bs.

'''Oldfag''' is an extension of [[4chan]]'s [[truth|reassuringly frank]]  linguistic convention of using the word 'fag' in [[portmanteau|portmanteaux]] when describing [[fags|4channers]] and other internet users. 

They are the cells most resilient to [[The Chemo That Is Curing /b/|chemotherapy]], the bunch of cancerous [[lemonparty|old age pensioners]] that they are; sitting on their front porch with their laptops, complaining to the [[nobody cares|internet]] about the [[Web 1.0|"good old days"]], and threatening to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|leave /b/ forever]]. The rest of us can only pray for the day when they actually [[DO IT FAGGOT|do it]]. {{main|The Cancer That Is Killing /b/}}
