1justin is seen here with his former egf, [[LJ User]] {{lj|user=stopmybreath}}. Stopmybreath is no longer dating 1justin, and has recently flunked out of college due to rampant drug abuse. She has begun a promising career at a truck stop.  1justin is rumored to be e-dating [[misoconfused]].  When asked about the rumor, misoconfused declined to comment.

==Hate of Microsoft==
1justin, an unashamed Apple fanboy, derides [[Microsoft]] in his latest blog entry and also makes an open threat to slaughter anyone opposing his supreme, divinely-imposed, intrinsically-right view[http://1just.in/blog]:

:''Seriously, if anyone I know ever buys a non-Apple computer ever again I will punch them in the face and then smash their new shitty computer with a big fucking hammer.'' - '''1justin'''

When asked about being a "Power User", or a half-intelligent computer user, he responded:

:''no it's because i want things to just wok as they say i ouwld really rather not have to work at'' - '''1justin'''

Not only does the reduced grammatical skills and poor punctuation clearly show that 1justin is [[Sarcasm | as intelligent]] as the blog post shows, it presents evidence that he may even have mild to severe [[Retard | retardation]]. Yet another testament to the intelligence of someone who so fervently defends their view (Specifically about Apple Computers).
