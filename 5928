[[Image:Obsessed.jpg|thumb|You knew this image would be here because you were [[Internet stalking|stalking]] me.]]
According to various sources, '''obsession''' is a recurring and unwanted idea, often unreasonable or disturbing in nature, that cannot be eliminated. Most users of the [[Internets]] are obsessive about something or other, whether it be [[drama]], [[LiveJournal]], a [[canon]] work or a particular [[music|band]].

==Symptoms==
Obsessive behavior is easily identified. If you think that you or someone you know is obsessed, please consult this list of symptoms.
#Do they ever think about someone that they know solely via the Internets even when not on the Internets?
#Do they read and reply to every post a person makes on their LiveJournal or [[weblog|blog]]?
#Do they keep the name of a person on their [[AIM]] list, even after the discontinuance of communication, simply to see when they last logged on?
#Do they check someone's profile on [[MySpace]] to last see when they logged on, and for how long?
#Do they write or read [[fanfic]] or [[slashfic]] about a specific movie, book or other work?
#Do they belong to more than one LiveJournal [[communities|community]] about a single topic, person or subject?
#Do they continue to argue with and "defend themselves" from [[trolls]] or [[LJDrama]] staff, even when the obvious path of least resistance would be to simply ignore them?
#Do they own an LJDrama or [[Encyclopediadramatica|Encyclopedia Dramatica]] button?
#Do they check the [[:Special:Recentchanges|Recent Changes]] section of the Encyclopedia Dramatica hourly?

The stuff smells horrible, but for some reason it can still be bought at most any major [[mall]].
