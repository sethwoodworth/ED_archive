''This article is about the Android [[operating system]]. Perhaps you were looking for a [[robot|robotic companion]]?''

'''Android''' is a [[Java]] application running on top a [[castration|neutered]] [[Linux]] distribution. [[irony|Ironically]], in the context of how [[Unix]] got its name, "Android" is quite appropriate; it is now completely [[tranny|androgynous]]. It was made popular by [[Google]] with their [[when you see it|shitbrick]] the G1. Android runs on various devices, most notably just about any phone by HTC and the Motorola Droid. It's the [[old|new]] [[Windows|one-size-fits-all OS]], and the [[cum|glue]] holding many a [[advertising|marketing]] [[lemonparty|circlejerk]] together.

==What can you do with it==
[[File:GoogleMalware.png|thumb|Google Chrome thinks that the Android Market is a cover for attackers to install [[malware]] on your computer, and they are correct!]]
* Make phone calls. (Unless you have a Motorola Backflip with AT&T).
* Root it! ([[Shit Nobody Cares About|Same as jailbreaking, except what you can do with jailbreaking an iPhone you can do with a stock Android device. Rooting an Android phone lets you do all kinds of neat things like changing the operating system with custom recovery images and sweet star wars wallpapers.]])
* overclock
* [[Tethering|Tether]] your phone to your laptop to share your phone's [[Internets]]. This can be done via USB or WiFi.
* [[Flash|Play Farmville.]]
* Download free apps.
* Download porn apps. (So as long as the [[Parents Television Council]] keeps their hands off the Android Marketplace!)
* Download Sound /b/oard.
* Install apps remotely with [http://appbrain.com/ Appbrain]
* Use your bluetooth headphones.
* WiFi / Wardriving
* Take photos in the dark. (some android phones have double flash all the way)
* Scan barcodes.
* Tell Google everything that you are doing. (This can be minimized by turning off "Submit usage to Google" and by not using Google Buzz.)
* Buy a fucking piece of plastic to protect the screen from your dirty fingers from Verizon for $15. (WTF?!)
* Flood the Android Market with [[over 9000]] bogus apps that do nothing but show you a couple of images of celebrities ripped from Google Images and sell them for 99 cents.

* Use Google Goggles to identify fucking everything.
* Play retro video games with [[NES]], [[SNES]], [[SEGA|Genesis]], [[PlayStation|PS1]] emulators and more. 
* Use a physical keyboard (on many Motorola and HTC phones). Beware that if you are a [[fatty]] with fat fingers [[nobody cares]] about you or your ability to use a hardware keyboard.
* Buy yourself some [[Hookers and blow|hookers and beer]] with the extra money you won't be shelling out to buy an iPhone.
* Laugh at people walking out of an AT&T or Mac Store who will be sleeping in a cardboard box with their Apple Debt.
* Take photos of said [[basement dweller|cardboard dwellers]] as they cry their salty tears into the gutter because they have no home to go to anymore.

* [http://www.mobidroid.com/products/dildroid Fuck it.]

==What you can't do with it ==
[[File:G1time2.jpg|thumb|Main promotional photo for the G1, where the clock is set to 2 different times 2:47 and [[9/11|9:11]]. This is thought to be a message from an [[1337|elite]] group of Google engineers tho are desperately trying to get out [[JEWS DID WTC|the truth]].]] 
* You can't use it with any [[iPod]] enabled device. Like you would want to anyways, not a big loss there. You can, however, plug it into any standard audio jack or USB port.
* Some devices can't be used with a [[Mac]] because it hasn't been approved by your [[Macfag|Apple Genius]], and nothing of value was lost.
* You can't use [[IRC]] on some [[shit|3G]] [[Snugglenets|networks]] that only allow for secure connection. You can however IRC using WiFi or through 3G on browser based clients like Mibbit. You could also be 1337 and [[SSH]] in through a [[UNIX]] server and screen irssi you [[faggot|Mary]]. Nothing is more fulfilling than unleashing the power of [[gay.pl]] while you are driving.  
* <s>Install it on an iPhone.</s> [http://www.idroidproject.org/wiki/Status Now you can.]
* Have an acceptable battery life.  (GIANT battery may fix)
* Have a mediocre battery life. (Root+CPU manager fixes this)
* Back up your phone log or text messages. (3rd Party has this covered nao)
* Back up your browser bookmarks (Again, 3rd party has it covered)
* Back up any of the apps you downloaded for free. (Most of the apps that you paid for are remembered. PDANet won't appear in that list because you paid the folks at PDANet not Google.)
* Back up any other data stored on internal memory. (See root)
* Get the guy at the [[Verizon|phone store]] to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]] off your old Android phone.

==What you will be able to do with it in the future==
[[Image:Android pr0n.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Pedophilia|A perfect gift for little kids.]]]]
[[File:Gingerbread-zombie-painting.jpg|thumb|[[I, for one, welcome our new X overlords|I, for one, welcome our new Android overlords.]]]]
* Play WebM/HTML5/VP8
* Play music over the cloud without buffering or hiccups (Google is making music to stream over your network instead of using space).
* Use it with Google TV to run your porn apps.
* [[Divide by Zero]] (According to Gizmodo).

==Banned Apps==
Just like Apple, Google also has a blacklist of apps, although they have yet to blacklist most of the [[shit]] apps that flood the Android Market everyday.  Verizon, in particular, doesn't like any app that allows users to [http://www.cnet.com/8301-19736_1-20013244-251.html avoid paying their $20 add on fee for Wifi tethering]. The average Android user is paying about $107 per month for service through Verizon Wireless, so fuck them.
* [http://www.unstableapps.com/?p=44 Easy Root] was removed from thew market for stealing the source for the app from DMUpdate, a FREE rooting process.
* Android [[Last Thursday|recently]] decided to [http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/08/13/google-quashes-pro-hitler-android-apps/ remove a slew] of [[Hitler]] and [[Nazi]] themed add-ons from the Market for being [[Offended|obscene]] in the eyes of Jews. No word yet on when the Star of David is going to be taken down for being offensive to the rest of the world.

== ED Users on Making Apps ==
{{tinyquote|No don't. It's a [[java]] sandbox wrapped in another sandbox.|[[User:h64]]}}

If for some in-fucking-credibly misguided reason you do decide to make an app, heed this warning; you will want to fucking [[an hero|shoot yourself]] half way through.

== Android Kill Switch ==
On June 25, 2010, Google added a new remote feature to the Android Operating system: [http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_activates_android_kill_switch_zaps_useless_apps.php?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+readwriteweb+(ReadWriteWeb) The Android Kill Switch].
While Google defends this new backdoor program [[lie|will be used for good]] to allow Google to delete [[shit]] apps off your Android phone, it is essentially Google's version of the [[Internet Kill Switch]].

'''UPDATE:''' As [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R706isyDrqI a wise sage once predicted], Google has in fact used the kill switch. Google is an enemy of your freedom.
== Oracle Gets Butthurt ==
In a move that seems like one part dickery and twenty parts [[retard|stupid]], Oracle, not mere months after acquiring Sun, have decided to sue Google over their use of Java as the primary development language for Android. If Oracle somehow wins this suit, it could mean the end of Java on Android. All things considered, this would not be the worst thing to happen considering Java is pure and utter shit. Besides, didn't Google make some other compiled language? Why the fuck don't they just use that? Anything is better than fucking Java.
