CD

A '''CD''' is a type of [[old media]] made of [[polycarbonate]] and [[metal|shiny]] that was synonymous with the retarded 90's buzzword "MULTI-MEDIA" for its ability to store pictures AND sounds. [[Retard|People]] would go to stores to purchase music until the invention of the [[P2P]], which freed everyone from the [[RIAA|tyranny of high prices]]. With the invention of the [[mp3]] format (see also [[dumbass|apple formats]]) the CD fell into obsolesce, only to be used by [[old people]], [[completist]]s, [[nigras]] and other people who have no [[masturbation|grasp]] on how to use a [[computer]].

As a side note, they can also be broken in half and used as shanks.

If you happen to have one, remember that you can put it in a [[computer]] and inscribe it with 700MB of [[lulz]]. Who knew?
