The term spin may refer to one or more of the following:

* [[Leekspin.com]]. Basically a [[Electric Boogaloo|Meatspin 2: Electric Boogaloo]] is all you really need to know.

* In classical [[physics]], spinning is the action of an object rotating around its own axis.

* In [[quantum]] physics, spin is a property of all particles, which do not rotate, have no axes, and may in fact be waves. This is proof that modern physicists are [[retarded]].

* In politics, spin is the act of trying to convince people that what looks like one thing is in fact something completely different.

* In [[internets]] slang, spinning is the act of getting the spin on [[meatspin.com|meat]].

* In mortuary science, '''spinning''' is what many famous dead white European males (DWEMs) are doing thanks to their entries in Encyclopaedia Dramatica.

* In [[sexual]] terminology, a '''spinner''' is a [[Jailbait|petite woman]] who, when on top, can spin around on your [[cock]] with minimal effort. Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
