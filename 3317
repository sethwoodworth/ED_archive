Ghostlight
[[Image:Ghost.jpg|thumb|professional [[fag|faggot]]]]
{{Lj|user=ghostlight}} is [[LJ]]'s most annoying non-[[fake journal|fake]] user who tries desperately to act like a [[troll]]. He [[drama]]tizes everything and acts like he does not care about what people think of him, yet he checks his inbox for [[LJ]] replies close to 468 times a day and guards his [[LJ]] like a fortress. <br />
He <strike>[http://www.frienditto.com/community/rant_about_cons/300069.htmlXthread=3999781#t3999781 has been likened to]</strike> [[Morpheus]], from the Matrix, due to his obsession with the internet.

Overall, Ghostlight is kind of OK even if he is not particularly memorable. The problem is that nobody remembers he's OK because he's not particularly memorable.

==Writing Style and Technique==
Ghostlight writes long entries in a miserable attempt at being witty. However, his [[Good Joke:Word Count Ratio]] is about 1:500 on a good day, which makes him disgustingly [[unfunny]].  He is nearly always present at any drama but routinely arrives late and participates with a [[sock journal]], if at all.    

He never leaves [[LJ]] land and is addicted beyond rehabilitation. He wastes his life trying to find dirt on other users, takes himself way too seriously, and makes a fool of himself regularly. He has been [[Pwned]] in every [[LJ]] community, including the two remaining ones that he has yet to post in. 

He is usually seen hanging out with a flat-faced camwhore who lacks any intelligence known around [[LJ]] as {{Lj|user=girlyunderwear}}, and fat, red-headed cunt known as {{Lj|user=hotlavamonster}}.

==Avatar and Penis Size==
He has nearly 50 icons of Transmetropolitan because he is afraid to post any actual pictures of himself. His icons sure do make him look like a strong and mysterious man with awesome shades, yet [[IRL]] his penis is about 3 inches (erect).

== LJers4President 2004 ==
Ghostlight arrived in {{ljcomm|user=LJers4president}} at around the time when all the [[internet celebrity|internet celebrities]] decided the [[moderator|moderators]] were taking it too seriously and bailed ship.  He remained on the sidelines for around a week until he rocketed into pole position after [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ljers4president/43479.html?thread=635607#t635607 critiquing women's fashion], prompting an extended [[flame war]].  He then proceeded to <strike>[http://www.livejournal.com/community/ljers4president/71408.html?thread=1167088#t1167088 routinely mock participants]</strike> (prompting more flame wars, and [[Kamuela|Kamuela's]] ire).  His sole contribution to the actual presidential race was an animated [[goatse|goatse.cx]] banner for [[elgorgo|El Gorgo's]] campaign, [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ljers4president/74893.html?thread=1239949#t1239949 the thread of which] prompted warnings from [[dancingdrew]], and set in motion [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ljers4president/78468.html plans] to [[ban]] him from the [[community]].<br />
Other behavior included repeatedly insisting [[dancingdrew]] was a [[Godwin's Law|fascist]]; [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ljers4president/57508.html?thread=937124#t937124 sucking up to banned candidate], disconscious; [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ljers4president/69106.html publically declaring his obesity and abstinence from the race]; and cultivating a running joke of being the same person as {{lj|user=volpex}} : [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ljers4president/47440.html 1] & [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ljers4president/58842.html?thread=966618#t966618 2].

== The Deletion ==
Sometime in, like mid-2005 or something, the Ghostlight journal was deleted. Or suspended. Or something. Some black person started trippin', but before anyone made the conscious effort not to care, it was back. At first, it seemed like he had changed, but after careful investigation, the [[Good Joke:Word Count Ratio]] remained intact, much to the chagrin of Livejournal en masse.

== Pre-[[Livejournal|Historical]] Ghostlight ==
First appeared as a contributing member of alt.binaries.pictures.grotesque for several months - a period during which trial-by-fire rendered him immune to [[tubgirl]] and all forms of [[iworshipsatin|disgust]].

After migrating to alt.games.nintendo.pokemon, he quickly became labelled a troll due to his disingenuous arguments and unrepenting verbal harassment of others.  During this period he instigated the much vaunted troll of [[NO BINARIES]], and left the community several months after finally managing to offend practically everyone when he replied "[http://groups.google.co.nz/groups?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&selm=ihDn7.125%244j.37443%40news.xtra.co.nz Not any more]" to a September 11, 2001, post asking "We don't have any New Yorker AGNPers do we?"</tt><br style="clear: both;" />
