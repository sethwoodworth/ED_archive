Anthropophobia

'''Anthropophobia''' is a [[mental illness]] characterized by a general fear of [[people]] and of human contact. In spite of its prevalence [[OTI]], anthrophobia is not one of the frequently self-diagnosed [[disorder]]s, unlike [[Asperger's Syndrome]], [[ADHD]], [[fibromyalgia]], etc.

Many [[furries]] suffer from anthropophobia; many would rather get off by seeing the word ''[[yiff|YIFF]]'' typed a few times in an [[AIM]] conversation than leave their homes in order to have [[actual]] [[sex]].

There is also the generic [[basement-dweller]], who will never lose his or her [[virginity]] and spends most of his/her time [[on the internet]] playing [[World of Warcraft]] or some other shitty [[MMORPG]].
