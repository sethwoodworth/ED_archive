'''Sacha Baron Cohen'''Jew, aka [[paki|Borat]], aka [[Wigger|Ali G]] aka [[Brüno]], is a [[jewish]] actor/comedian who has managed to induce a high number of [[footbullet]]s and [[self-pwn]]s due to his epic [[sockpuppet]] [[IRL trolling]].  

Proof of his [[Judaism]] can be found in the name of Baron Cohen's production company which is called [[true|''Four By Two'']] which is [[London|Cockney]] rhyming [[rap|slang]] for Jew.

'''Borat Sagdiyev''' is well respected [[Russia|Kazakh]] [[troll|journalist]] with a [[Anti-Americanism|deep love]] for [[America|Amur-i-ka]]. He boasts a lengthy resume, including news reporting in [[Albania]] and Moldova. 

Typical of Jewish comedies in the style of Will and Grace, Borat's productions compensate for the absence of taste by an overflow of gay inuendo.

Lately he has turned his focus from straight reporting to public awareness. In 1969, he spent time in [[England]] and America trying to [[troll|capture]] the essence of [[MTV|Western Culture]], including [[W|Democracy]] and [[Slave|Freedom]], for the [[communist|people]] of Kazakhstan.

==Personal Beliefs==
Mr. Sagdiyev's values are deeply rooted in [[buttsecks|Kazakh tradition]], so in the true spirit of cultural tolerance through the free exchange of ideals, he always tries to [[Goatse|broaden the horizons]] of those he visits as he too learns local customs. One especially notable act of Borat "giving back" was a crowd-pleasing [[troll|performance]] in an [[Arizona]] country music bar, where he sang the hit Kazakh song "Throw The Jew Down The Well (So My Country Can Be Free)" about the [[do not want|plight]] of [[Jews]] in Kazakhstan. The chorus is:

:Throw the Jew down the well
:So my country can be free  
:You must grab him by his horns   
:Then we have a big party 

Besides the Jews, he is also sensitive to the plight of [[gay]]s, [[gypsies]], pigs and [[women]] (in that order).
 
Recently, however, a Jewish actor called Sasha Cohen sparked [[lulz|controversy]] for Borat by [[sock puppet|impersonating]] the newsman on TV lampooning such time-honored Kazakh customs as [[incest]] and [[rape]], causing the [[unfunny|Kazakhstan government]] to publicly speak out against Mr. Sagdiyev, [[ban]] him from their [[internet]], and threaten [[IRL drama|frivolous litigation]]. In order to set the record straight, Borat posted the following on his own American website:

:"''In response to Mr. Ashykbayev's comments, I'd like to state I have no connection with Mr. Cohen and fully support my Government's decision to sue this Jew. Since the 2003 Tuleyakiv reforms, Kazakhstan is as civilized as any other country in the world. Women can now travel on <u>inside</u> of bus, homosexuals no longer have to wear blue hats, and age of consent has been raised to eight years old. Please, captain of industry; I invite you to come to Kazakhstan where we have incredible natural resources, hardworking labor, and some of the cleanest prostitutes in whole of central Asia. Chenquieh!''"

===Quotes===
* "[[epic win|Great success!]]"
* (After a long wet French Kiss) "This is my sister. She is 4th best prostitute in whole Kazakhstan."
* "Sexy time!"
* "He decided not to fly by air, in case the Jews repeated [[JEWS DID WTC|their attacks of 9/11]]."
* "How dare you [[Masturbation|make hand-party]] all over Pamela!!"
* (After asking Pamela Anderson to marry him) "[[Rape|Agreement is not necessary]]."
*"I am a [[homosexual]]."

==Fame and Fortune==

Borat's [[troll|fame]] has reached such massive proportions that it will no longer fit in a TV set. [[Last Thursday|Last November]], he hosted the [[MTV]] [[Europe]] Awards [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/11/bc8819f5-9eee-4220-b2e2-3e6ad0dcb131.html] in Lisbon, Portugal and his big screen debut is slated for release as soon as [[last Thursday]].

The [[troll|documentary]], ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443453/ Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]'' was commissioned by the Kazakh Government), takes a look at the [[America]]n [[fucktard|people]], their [[crap|culture]] and their [[insane|psyche]] as seen through the eyes of Mr. Sagdiyev, who's previous [[troll|assignments]] here have made him as beloved to the American people as they are to him (except for the Jews, who make it necessary for him to travel by road and rail in case (to quote Borat) "The [[JEWS_DID_WTC|Jews repeat their attack of 9/11.”]]. [[Last_Thursday|Recently]] some [[Drunk|frat]] [[retard|boys]] decided to sue Borat for [[Defamation|deflaming]] them in front of the world. The president of the national fraternity supported them, not wanting fraternities to become associated with inebriation, black person or [[rape|misogyny]].

Sadly, much cancer has formed as a result of Borat's exploits. For [[at least 100 years]] after the movie came out, [[13 year old boys]] were to be heard quoting the movie incessantly, to the tune of "very nise!" or the ever-infuriating "my name-a Borat". While vaguely amusing when first heard, these [[Unfunny|hilarious]] one-liners very rapidly pissed off [[White People|anyone with more than 3 brain cells]]; so of course they were generally well-liked. Those who quoted these lines (often in a [[Fail|poor emulation]] of the original delivery, imitating Borat's voice) gained an almost orgasmic gratification when they received the one or two polite smiles from [[Pussies|people who didn't have the grapes to spit in their face and tell them to fornicate themselves with a palm tree.]]


==Impressions==
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAQMfl91s2c Impressions] are done by frat boys and drunk girls who think they are the next Richard Pryor. After a shitty impression is done people are forced to laugh even though they want the person to die a horrible death. These people are easy to fuck with. You can make at least one pretentious asshole leave any party by screaming 'My name-a Borat! High Five!' in a voice that is a mix of Kermit and Louie Armstrong. Get three friends laughing hysterically at your joke and your new friend will be one step closer to becoming [[an hero]]

===Is Borat Like [[ED]]?===

Borat is one of the best examples of [[IRL]] [[trolling]] - having been arrested literally every single day whilst making the movie. In some ways Borat resembled [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]:

<b>PROS:</b>

* Unlike some other shitty shows that try to be edgy (like ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]''), Borat doesn't only [[troll]] people who deserve to be trolled, or try to justify his trolling - he trolls because he fucking can.

* No one is safe - [[faggots]], [[americunts]], [[feminazis]], [[PETA|animals]], [[Jews]], [[children]] etc. No one.

* He has several [[sockpuppets]].

* He gets sued every week or so.

* He has been noted for displaying pedophilic pretensions. At a [http://judicial-inc.biz/sa,sha_cohen.htm concert], he started dry-humping a preteen. If you were to try this at your school concert you could easily get booked.

<b>CONS:</b>

* He's a Jew. Although he may be ugly and hairy, at least he's not a [[furry]]. Although he was [[rape|raped]] by a bear.

==Real Kazakhstan==
In real Kazakhstan, the most popular Kazakh is Freestailo, not Jew Borat.
