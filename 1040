[[Image:Pillage.jpg|thumb|right|What Happens When [[CNN]] Finds Something of Value on the Blogosphere]]
When [[emo|emo's]], [[furries]], [[fags]], and [[gays]] have no where to turn to, when even [[Gaia]] and [[Livejournal]] simply can't give a shit, there is the blogosphere.  This is the place where extensive [[tl;dr]] [[shit nobody cares about|coverage of news, politics, and debates]] occur.  However, because the only people who give a shit about the blogosphere are the [[retards|people who run them]], the blogosphere is a goldmine for the exploitation of [[lulz]] as the [[lolcow|lolcows]] who frequent them are easily [[offended]].  [[Drama]] can and will run rampant as soon as their [[lies|Radical New Ideas]] are exposed as [[bullshit]] and [[rape]] and [[butthurt]] ensue.

Blogosphere actually stands for the collective term for [[weblogs]] that the [[old media]] came up with [[at least 100]] years ago.  However, [[attention whores|Only the blogs looking for acceptance in the mainstream media]] (the "MSM") actually seem to use it.  This means that no one cares, because the [[jews|national media]] are too busy counting their [[money|phat loots]] and [[hookers and blow|finding their next high]] to give a shit.  What is absolutely hilarious is that even if [[CNN]] does glance a blinking eye they will [[steal]], rape, and pillage everything in sight, send out an intern to investigate the actual events and [[copypasta]] most of the original dox to their website [[for great justice]].

The [[basement dweller]] will then scream about the [[fursecution|persecution]] of their [[hick|small time]] publication.  They will proceed to [[cream]] their panties in confusion.  They will contact their lawyers and prepare an [[lolsuit]] forgetting that CNN has IRL Lawyers.  Meanwhile [[Al Gore]], emperor of the internet, and CNN will proceed to count all of their fresh [[Jew Gold]].  For continued lulz, CNN will then uncover the [[pedobear|demons]] in the owner's closet subsequently raep any remaining [[lulz|dignity]] from their freshly deceased [[necrophilia|corpse]] before sending them off to meet [[Chris Hansen]] and later, [[Bubba]].

This of course means that plenty of [[win]] can be found by [[trolls]] looking for a [[buttsecks|good time.]]  Great [[fap]] material is had by all those who can post a clever retort.  These people are always [[asking for it]], and those who troll are always giving it to them.  Since they can't make an argument logically anyway it is easy to correct all of their errors, (i.e. The [[Grammar Nazi]] approach) or simply produce a truthful argument that can't be [[fact|disputed]].  And finally by declaring that [[I did it for the lulz]] the [[epic]] win can fully be accomplished.

[[PROTIP]]: Logic Does Not Faze Their Tiny Minds.  Use the Lulz Instead.

==Blogosphere, Serious Fucking Business.==
[[Image:Megan_Meier_Fox_News.jpg|thumb|The Blogosphere: The Home of All On-Line [[Outrage]]!]]
Contrary to popular belief,  The Blogosphere is [[Serious Fucking Business]].  Everyone has [[boring|important]] opinions that need to be expressed, and the world needs to [[bullshit|know]].  This [[unwarranted self importance|need]] makes the owner a perfect [[lol-cow]] that requires milking for much [[lulz]].  Because they truly believe the dribble spewing out of their pie hole they will defend their beliefs until they are as incoherent and ridiculous as the people who are trolling them.  It is not uncommon for them to then get [[Internet Tough Guy|angry]] and threaten those who would defile their manifesto.  If they are saavy they will attempt to block the troll using the almighty [[banhammer]].  However, as many of them are n00bs, they forget that trolls have [[friends|magical powers]] and thus are immune to all non-lethal attacks.  When they finally decide to privatize their journal they BAAWWW about the lack of new viewers to their pages.  Many of them then decide that they have been [[pwned|defeated]] and decide to [[delete fucking everything]].  [[Hal Turner|Others]] decide to reopen their decrying thepages  bullying and threatening to [[buy a dog]] and put up curtains.

It has also become customary to become [[an hero]] only after first proclaiming it on the blogosphere.  This of course is designed to cause as much [[e-drama]] and [[butthurt]] as possible.  The real truth is that the [[Emo]] just wants as much attention as possible before his inevitable [[IRL]] [[Death|B&]].  Of course this can be turned against them by enterprising trolls with well-placed posts of [[do it fgt]], become [[an hero]] and [[I told you i was hardcore]].  This allows the [[attention whore]] to know how the world really feels. Their complete [[unwarranted self importance]] thwarted they will produce much lulz by proceeding with their self IRL permaban (hopefully on live webcam).  Then, suddenly a [[puma]] will appear and they will finally get in the [[Kevin Neil Whitrick|noose]].  At this moment the peasants will rejoice.  Hopefully they'll take [[school shooting|someone with them]] and try to beat [[VT|Blazin Azn's]] high score.

==[[fail|Epic Fail]]==

When [[b|/b/-tards]] decide it's a good idea to write [[blogs]] it can be ensured that [[fail]] is sure to ensue.  [[Over 9000]] /b/-tard-s have attempted this feat, but none have [[evar]] [[you are doing it wrong|been able to do it right.]]  The problems come at the very beginning as most are Gaia fags and they forget to [[LURK MOAR]] before proclaiming /b/!  They then take their [[leet]] skills and decide to make a post identifying themselves as a /b/-tard forgetting the principles of [[anon|Anonymous]] and shitting all over [[Rules of the Internet|Rules 1 & 2]].
WE'RE FROM [[Ebaumsworld|E/b/AUMS]] FOR GOD'S SAKE[[1|!!!!!1oneoneone11]].

They then will begin [[x is not your personal army|rallying troops]], Reciting [[old meme|old meme's]], and [[divide by zero|dividing by zero]] as epic amounts of fail are exponentially produced. Luckily however, the [[4Chan]] [[partyvan|party V&]] soon roots out the source of anti-lulz and removes the offending party giving them an express trip on a [[prison|IRL Banhammer]].  When asked about the perp an agent of the V& will then proclaim [[I did it for the lulz]] and drive off cackling with mad laughter.
