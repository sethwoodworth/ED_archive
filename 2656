Encyc
[[Image:Encyceditwar.jpg|thumb|This is considered a constructive day over at Encyc.]]
'''Encyc''' is a [[Fail|small-time wiki]] run by a guy calling himself Emperor that markets itself as the [[USI|top competitor]] to [[Wikipedia]]. It is inhabited also by his sockpuppet Duke of Puke and the [[sockpuppet|alternate]] accounts of a Wikipedian known as "emesee".

==Site History==
Opened in 2005, it was a personal wiki for Emperor and [[sockpuppet|Duke of Puke]].  Around the end of 2007, Emperor installed [[MediaWiki]] and being creative enough not to use the default name "Sysop" but not creative enough to think of an alias, he chose Emperor.

Feb 2008, [[Blissyu2]] asked to use the [[MediaWiki]] to write boring things like [[Port Arthur massacre]] and also document the [[truth]] about what had happened with regards to [[Somey]] stealing [[Wikipedia Review]] from him.   Each time Blissyu2 wrote a [[lul]]zy article including topics like how Somey is a criminal, how his best friend [[Nathanr]] backstabbed him, how [[Poetlister]] was not a guy and was unfairly banned (which was changed about four months later due to Poetlister's sockpuppets being revealed as such by [[ED]] administrators), how Kato on WR is the same person as [[SlimVirgin]], and how [[no girls on the internet|Selina is probably the same person as Somey]].  Each new addition was eagerly read and laughed at.

All was fine, and for many months his [[schizophrenia|work]] remained untouched.

Enter Alison.

[[Alison]] decided that, based on an absolutely true statement that she had been asked by [[Somey]] to hurt Blissyu2's reputation, that she would really seriously hurt him, and started to use Encyc to make a seriously nasty smear campaign against Blissyu2.

Alison didn't stop with writing nonsense in articles about him, but rather went further by simultaneously claiming that Encyc was "Blissypedia", and that her "Duty was to correct all of Blissyu2's delusions".  In other words, that Alison's entire reason to be there was to destroy his life.  Whilst destroying his life with massive smear campaigns, Alison constantly accused Blissyu2 of secretly [[libel]]ing other people.

A few days before [[Poetlister]] was outed as a large, hairy British gay man, Blissyu2 was busily writing a page defending [[trap|her]] innocence. Once the trap was outed, Blissyu2 then immediately claimed he knew about it all along.  So then Alison created a whole army of [[sock puppet]]s, and used them to start a massive campaign on Encyc.  Soon [[Proabivouac]] started thinking Blissyu2 was Poetlister.  Things escalated and as the socks had names like Sonichu [http://encyc.org/wiki/index.php5?title=Special:Contributions/Sonichu], Emperor didn't think it was Alison doing it and blamed [[Chris-chan]] instead.  As Emperor doesn't read ED (viruses), he'll never know.

===Grawp helps Alison===
In 2008, [[Grawp]] made a lightning raid on Encyc. Alison flew to the rescue and had a heroic mock-battle with him. Emperor was taken in and imagined that Alison had saved his wiki, so he granted her long-held wish [http://encyc.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&user=&page=&year=&month=-1 to be an admin there.]

Blissyu2, seeing the vandalism, realized that it was done by [[Somey]]. [http://encyc.org/wiki/index.php5?title=User_talk%3AEmperor&diff=416&oldid=343]  It is now a [[PROVE ME WRONG|proven fact]] that Grawp and Somey are the same person.

It seemed that it wasn't to last and Emperor [http://encyc.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&user=&page=User%3AAlison&year=&month=-1 stole back the sysop bit] before she could block [[Blissyu2]] and baleet the main page. But what's this? Look again! He's restored her bit ''and'' given it to [[Nathanr]] [http://encyc.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&user=&page=User%3ANathan&year=&month=-1] and ... wait for it ... [[Blissyu2]] [http://encyc.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&user=&page=User%3ABlissyu2&year=&month=-1] himself. Bliss would again [http://encyc.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&user=&page=User%3A+Blissyu2&year=&month=-1 lose it 5 days later] for going on a [[baleet]] rampage.

===Later on===
With Blissyu2 gone, Alison de-lulzed his humorous articles and now everyone there only writes serious articles about [[Shit nobody cares about|Albert Einstein and stuff]].

Febrary 2008, Sgt. Snopake came by, much to [[Nathanr]]'s dismay. [http://encyc.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nathan&diff=prev&oldid=6844] For those unfamiliar and don't want to read the TL;DR story, imagine being really nervous asking a girl out and then you tell her you love her, not a request for sex, just that you love her.  All your hopes are based on how she responds.  Then...  then...  She said, "Oh my god, I'm 16 and you're 28. You pedophile!"  She then gets her brother to beat you up, then gets you banned from Wikipedia forever, then gets you [[Party Van|vanned]] so you must register as a convicted sex offender, then gets the government to castrate you as a [[child molester]], and then afterward she gets knocked up by one of the thirty older black men she's been sleeping with.  Well Nathan's ex-flame has taken up permanent residence on Encyc and is expected to become sysop soon. Nathan will like that.

Nowadays, Emesee creates sockpuppets such as Elmer, Academia, Wikademia, and Writer, spreading [[right-wing]] [[bullshit]] and propaganda for everyone to absorb, under the guise of providing educational material and promoting his personal Wikipedia fork and conservative spam repository [[spam|Wikademia]]. He constantly uses these other accounts.

===Blissyu2 Speaks!===
* [http://encyc.org/wiki/Kato "(Kato)'s trap had managed to snare Blissyu2, under the guise of pretending that it was to hurt SlimVirgin. In actual fact, Kato never intended to hurt SlimVirgin or anyone on Wikipedia. His aim was to get more power on Wikipedia Review."]

* [http://encyc.org/wiki/Somey "Somey ruined it all by doing the most despicable act imaginable and banning the owner of the site from his own site ... Somey neglected to remember that its illegal to do that, and constitutes identity theft, theft and fraud ... Somey has now parked on various domain names to try to prevent Blissyu2 from ever having anything remotely like Wikipedia Review, parking on Blissyu2's preferred alternate name WikipediaCritics.com (Blissyu2 had e-mailed Somey to agree to a compromise - that Somey let Blissyu2 on, unban him, and he will simply advertise his new site and then that's it - Somey responded by parking the domain name, refusing to unban him, telling the hosts that he was Blissyu2 and the real Blissyu2 was a fraud, and then laughing at how easy it was for him to get away with criminal activities!) ... Somey's true identity remains something of a mystery. ... Somey is responsible for creating the new skins (you can alternate between them), which for a period of 1 week in September 2007 led to Wikipedia Review being down."]
