Dave Hopkins
[[Image:Daveshark.jpg|thumb|A hideous, gilled, sharp-teethed, sea-dwelling monster. Also pictured, a shark]]
Dave Hopkins: quasi-man, quasi-artist, full-furfag. Known around the block as 'Drip', 'that guy who can't draw', or 'the poor man's [[Jay Naylor]]', Mr. Hopkins is the creator of such [[shit|literary masterpieces]] as [http://www.vitenka.com/Rtd1/ Rework The Dead] and [http://www.pholph.com/ Jack].  Mr. Hopkins' work has the honor of perhaps being the most disgusting and disturbing furry art on the internet.  Readers of his grotesquely violent, gore-filled, and schlocky (yes, even for the internet) Christian furry comic Jack typically find themselves clawing their eyes, curling into fetal positions and crying, or attempting to induce vomiting in order to cleanse themselves from the horror they have witnessed.  Unlike such comics as El Goonish Shive or [[Megatokyo]], this action typically occurs [[no more than 99]] strips into the series, as opposed to [[over 9000]].  For those masochistic connoisseurs of furry art, though, Hopkins' work is a wet dream come true, essentially the equivalent of the works of the most [[autistic]] [[sick fuck]]s on DeviantART combined and serialized, with a healthy dose of [[Chick tract]] thrown in.  Surely the holy grail of [[webcomics]].

==The Early Years==
[[Image:furrydoommod.png|thumb|One of the aforementioned Doom mods.]]
Dave Hopkins grew up and lives in Washington State, which probably explains a lot of his issues, in retrospect.

Back before he had any fanboys, David would play [[Doom]] often.
So often, he decided to make two whole sets of levels for it, [http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=6857 this one] and [http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=10901 that one]. The levels are very [[shit|amateurish]] in design, though what makes them interesting is the replacement of the teeth-gritting [[The Doom Comic|man-and-a-half]] protagonist of Doom, with a [[MS Paint]] created cartoon fox, or weasel, or something. The enemies are mostly unchanged, but the powerups are replaced with naked furry women that you [[yiff|pick up]] for health, basically making the game Duke Nukem 3D for faggots.

==Rework The Dead==
[[Image:Compic.jpg|thumb|YEAH, WAR, WOOOO! CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THAT MOTHERFUCKING WAR, HELL YEAH! YOU WON'T SEE ME IN A MILITARY UNIFORM IN A THOUSAND YEARS, BUT YEAAAAAAAH, WAR!]]
Hopkins' first full foray into furfaggotry was [http://www.vitenka.com/Rtd1/ Rework The Dead], which was pretty much Hopkins' way to 'artistically' masturbate to the military lifestyle (even though as far as the internet knows, Hopkins has never been a part of the military. Nice double-standard, you pussy). Even worse, he's done this by [[e-theft|taking inspiration from]] every single zombie/sci-fi cliché compressed into two badly-drawn episodes, adding [[furries]] and subtracting a coherent ending. RtD quite possibly sets a new record for saturation of ideas ripped from movies, short stories/books, and short stories/books that eventually were made into movies. Any of these sound familiar?

*A virus has infected all of mankind [[cock block|that makes reproduction mysteriously impossible]], causing worldwide chaos as a result
*A member of the 'good guys' turning out to be a crazy-ass bloodlusting bad guy because it's eventually revealed he's a rapist and he killed his whole platoon a few years ago. This character eventually gets left for dead and is killed by the zombies.
*A love triangle where one guy dies, leaving the other to swoop in like a vulture and pick up the grief-stricken girl.
*The military attempt rescuing civilians but royally screw up and end up killing a bunch of them themselves.
*[[an hero|A soldier unpins a few grenades when hopelessly cornered, killing himself and taking out several zombies with him]]
*A female soldier who, gets this, is a real hardass, EVEN AROUND MEN. Everyone else is of course surprised by this character's strength, because [[noone]] has ever heard of the old atypical-military-female-character archetype.
*Badass soldiers [[emo|revealing softer sides]] to themselves at opportune times between zombie swarms. This is supposed to make the reader think "wow, this guy's actually pretty deep. I guess we can add half a dimension to the one he already had"
*A character driven insane by the horrors of anti-zombie warfare. He uses puppets.
*Small numbers of individuals who escape the zombie carnage and drive away in a daring attempt to find an army base

Throwing another little shit-nugget into his masterpiece, Hopkins also gave his readers an extra fuck-you by throwing ink onto paper the same way a hippo sprays crap out of its ass using its tail. Not only did he use a drawing style known in the art academies as 'teaching a gorilla to finger-paint with menstrual blood' and coloured everything with the refined and totally classy use of the 'fill' tool on MS Paint, he also displays the spelling skills of an [[retard|autistic child]]. I mean, no one likes a [[grammar nazi]] but jesus christ, those red squiggles under the words are trying to tell you something.

If Mr. Hopkins is talented at anything, though, it's his ability to take something that has for all intents and purposes hit rock-bottom and drag it down just that little bit further. With 'Rework The Dead', he accomplishes this right on the motherfuckin' first page by dedicating his heaping pile of cow patties to his father. Daddy Hopkins is reported to still get misty-eyed at the knowledge that he's forcibly been associated with the unoriginal drivel his son actually believed was a wise use of his time, full of sad regret that he didn't force the hermaphrodite Vietnamese hooker he smuggled back home for a wife to abort David's FAS-infected fetus when he had the chance. Such is the karma one gets for being too busy killing and raping civilians to win a war against some rag-tag commies who don't have running water or electricity, I guess.

Much like how Edmund Spencer moved from pastoral poetry to larger pieces, so did Dave Hopkins move from 'Rework The Dead' to new projects. Of course, whereas Spencer went on to write 'The Faerie Queene', a masterpiece of renaissance literature and of epic poetry, Hopkins went from 'Rework The Dead' to [http://www.pholph.com Jack]. This is basically like trading poorly-drawn, poorly-written shit for larger, longer, poorly-drawn, poorly-written shit. And then being proud of it. 'Jack' is a collection of stories, all of which relate to Dave's twisted visions of how the Christian afterlife works. Oh, and don't expect any of it to reflect the idea that Hopkins has ever cracked open a New Testament in his life. That's the last thing you'd want to do when you're making what is essentially a Christian story. The spelling is also improved - although it's been told he needed outside help for it. English class still hasn't been very friendly to Dave. There are also interspersed references to Nine Inch Nails lyrics, to ensure its appeal with the average angsty goth furfaggot.   

Hopkins' fundamentalism blossoms in 'Jack', sketching out his own little personal doctrine on what is and isn't right ('''''[[PROTIP]]:''''' If it involves liberal gun use, it's almost always right). Of course, I'm not sure I've ever found a religious text that involves [[rape]], [[murder]], and mass carnage without any real point/purpose to put any of it into perspective. Then again, maybe I missed the part in the Bible where the Twelve Tribes of Israel engage in a rape version of musical chairs for no real reason whatsoever.

As mentioned earlier, 'Jack' is a collection of stories all connected by a series of characters who inhabit the afterlife. There's the typical christian-realm spheres of existence:

*Heaven: Basically like having a genie that will grant you as many wishes as you want. The mortal characters who eventually get involved with Heaven are almost always involved in some tragic love story. Oh no, my lover died, boo-fuckity-hoo, guess I better be a good boy from now on so I can see her again. That kind of cliched garbage. It must be said, at least Dave is consistent in his unoriginality. There's also an angel who occasionally fucks her boyfriend, Plato. Plato, however, lived well before the coming of Jesus so he shouldn't be setting foot in Heaven. Nice research, asshole.
*Purgatory: Kinda like your life right now, except you're more dead. Also, angels will constantly harass you without a moment's peace in an attempt to get you to leave the afterlife and become reborn in a fresh attempt to get into Heaven. Either Purgatory has some serious real estate problems, or angels are total nosy assholes. Probably both. 
*Hell: This is the only realm anyone who reads Jack is interested in, for good reason. Damn pussies up there in Heaven and Purgatory. Hell is a morass of poorly-depicted rape, temporary murder (people just come back to life a few minutes later), and other various kinds of random mayhem. None of it occurs with anything resembling a 'point' or a 'moral', indicating it's just there so that Dave can put 'edgy' into his resume when he's between McJobs. 

===The Sins===
Hell is ruled between embodiments of the Seven Deadly Sins. All of them are very jagged and pointy, meaning they're evil. Satan doesn't really seem all that involved in any of the Helling business. I guess he doesn't run a very tight ship.
*Jack: Wrath. Apparently he was a furry Hitler or something. Also had a girlfriend called Jill (there's that trademark Hopkins originality again!) but [[pwned|he was born without a dick]] so he took his sexual fustrations out on killing people. Now he's the Grim Reaper, and lord knows he still hasn't bitched about it enough yet.
*Drip: Lust. He raped, tortured and killed people in life. Yeah, that's it. If committing a few rape-murders is all it takes to become one of the head-honchos in Hell, perhaps there's a little more to the saturday-morning-cartoon look to Dave's characters than first thought. Drip is Dave's [[fursona]], choosing the biggest asshole in the comic series because, again, it supposedly makes him 'edgy'
*Bob & Lisa: Gluttony. They were cannibals in life. Yeah. Jesus, what kind of low standards do they uphold in this place?
*Vince: Greed. He did greedy shit or something, I don't know. His eyes and mouth are sewn shut, which is probably some kind of [[b/|/b/tard]] fetish
*Emily: Vanity/Pride. We don't know what she did, but apparently she has no skin, and has a habit of wearing the skin of other furfags in "Jack" Hell  .
*the Envy guy. I'm really starting to stop giving a shit by this point.
*Sloth. Hopkins explains Sloth as being the very ground on which Hell is built. This is Hopkins' way of saying "I took way too long to reveal Sloth's identity, so it was impossible for me to come up with something that my brown-noser fans wouldn't find anticlimactic"

===Critical Acclaim===
[[Image:3rfd.jpg|thumb|[http://www.pholph.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11436 Want to own the Sistine Chapel of gaudy-coloured furfag shit? Well too late, they've been sold! Selling prices - Heaven:$81, Purgatory:$160, '''Hell:250 motherfucking dollars'''. Furries are goddamn idiots with money.]]]
For reasons that boggle most forms of science, Hopkins still has a large number of fans despite his complete lack of talent, originality, or spelling skills. Dave, of course, wastes no time in displaying such praise proudly on his 'Jack' site:

{{quote|"I'd have to say that "Jack" has balls that painfully few comics are brave enough to drag around. And it's not afraid to use them..."|[[2 gryphon|2 the Ranting Gryphon]]}}

{{quote|"If you go to this comic, you will gawk in amazement at how completely fucked up the author is."|Dragonfly of [http://latexblue.mechanicalmischief.com/index.php Latex Blue], a [[irony|pornographic comic about living inflatable latex furry cats and shit]]}}

Hopkins, however, made a terrible oversight; namely, he believes that someone whose idea of 'in your face' is to say (brace yourself for this) BOTH sides of the abortion debate are stupid has anything worth saying that shouldn't be immediately dismissed as childish nonsense. However, that hasn't stopped him from releasing t-shirts, playing cards, and comic books in an attempt to sell himself out like the cheap asian hooker he calls 'mom'.

He also has a [http://www.pholph.com/forum/ forum] packed to the brim with people collectively sucking David's shriveled little penis (David mysteriously has a wife despite this deformity. I guess she must be legally blind; I don't know how else you could look at that pic of him at the top of the entry and not want to slap the shit out of it with a shoe), sadly molding Davy's impressionable baby mind into thinking he's benefiting society by continuing his projects ([[PROTIP]]: he isn't). This results in a large collection of terrible/hilariously bad roleplaying threads, fan fiction based on Bon Jovi ([http://www.pholph.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11536 I swear to Christ]), [http://www.pholph.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11255 song lyrics], and [http://www.pholph.com/chibi.htm creepy fan art] (including [http://www.downtofurth.com/images/fanart/KILLDRIPBlue.gif shitty crossovers]. [http://www.pholph.com/forum/ Explore at your peril] for the groan-worthy [[lulz]].

It has recently been revealed to the author that some [[lulz]] have indeed already been had at the forum, mainly due to Dave's status quo of 'acting like a spoiled child':

{{quote|I used to be a regular at his forum, with nearly 6000 posts to my name. I even met him in person at a con, and managed to irritate him enough with questions regarding his plot holes that '''he threw pens at me''' (editor's note - lol, you sure showed him, Master of the Underworld).
Then he took the side of a self-proclaimed sociopath and someone who had threatened repeatedly to rape and murder various forum members (myself included! :D) due to said person having donated him $100. This caused literally his entire moderator team to quit at once, and led him and his webhost ("Tet Pholph", or Arty of "Vinci and Arty") editing the posts involved to make them look like brave heroes who stood up to the terrible demands of the moderators and forumites.
What? Why did I stick around on the forum that long in the first place?
... I'm still trying to figure that one out, actually.|Nyarlathotep}}

In his forum, some furfags instead of kissing his ass dared to critisize a few points in his latest comic, as seen [http://www.pholph.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15795 in this thread]. While doing so, some [[infidels]] voiced unholy doubts about God's benevolence and Heaven's existence.

To which Dave responded as classy as always, in a tl;dr [[BAWWW|kindergartener tantrum]]:

{{quote|Christ oh gad damnEd fuck mighty!!!

No one whoes died has ever told us about what it was like on the other end so whether your for or against SHUT THE JESUS FLIPPING FUCK UP! I don't know, no one knows SHUT UP! I don't give shit one about what some book, be it in a clergy or a professor's office has in it SHUT THE GOD DAMNED FUCK UP! No one can be proven right, no one can be proven wrong
SHUT UP

And any of you other little dipshits trying to tell me how to piss in my own pond SHUT UP! Its dramaticly more interesting to follow the folks having problems. is it too mmuch of a fucking leap to foolishly hope that on the other side of the camera the other 50 seven billion people I dont cover maybe figured this shit out on theyre own? Or do you constantly have to be the pesamistic bigot who hates anything with the word God in it? Well, since its my comic and I can decide, Miraculously they all made it out of hell and they're now pissing in your pond. Of corse hell isnt fair, because in its incarnation here its fucking fiction made up by some fellow dipshit washed up good for jackshit asshole barely liveing off of minimum wage in aa shit stinking apartment surrounded by fellow ass hole dipshits SO OF CORSE ITS NOT GOING TO BE ANY FUCKING FAIR, BECAUSE IM A FUCKING MORON JUST LIKE YOU

And for the same reason as stated above I was never going to ddo a God character to your likeing unless I made him drooling retard in floaties and a propeller cap. it was always going to be a little to this or a little too that. JESUS CHRIST I'D BE SHITING STONES IF GOD HIM SELF WASNT UP THERE SAYING "Dave you fucked me up big time"

You wanna know why I'm ready to just die now? Not figurativly, litteraly, see a few posts up. because my purpose in life is aparently to work my ass off to produce pages and pages of toilet papper!
What do I get for it? Answer! I want to know! Because if your answer isnt 2 words one being the title of this comic and the other a four letter explative than you are very very very very WRONG!!!

Copy this all or in parts to your news groups your forums, your chat rooms, and say look we got to him and pat yourselves on the back but after Kittiara's run for this comic ends this comic will still continue to update because one of us still has to be the dumbest motherfucker on the planet. And theres also that 'faith' thing that I should know to ignore by now, but I keep chasing like its an old highschool tart.

No sympathy posts, I swear to God, Christ and my uncles donkey if you post that shit I will ban you. I'm not throwing some God damned emo fit to get atention so save us both grief and don't do it. Also, this wasn't adressed to anyone so nobody blame it on any one. The glass is broken the ban stick is out and new holes have been drilled in it so it whistles before it slaps. C&R I feel better now that thats out so no need to do what your gonna do anyway.

To whom this isn't concerned please disregard
To who it is concerned disregard now rather than two weeks from now and get back to fighting over trivial nothingness
Apologies to those apropriate (especially God) and also for lack of spell check, I think I'd much rather go to bed.|Dave}}
