'''[http://rockstararmy.com RockstarChan]''' is an imageboard dedicated to <s>accidentally</s> causing [[fail]] and [[cancer]]. They have nerd base of refugees from many [[i|/i/]] boards with a group of [[fag|mods]] who [[Pretty_cool_guy|doesnt afraid of anything]]. Most of the users on it are mad [[Science|scientists]], [[Basement-dweller|hackers]], [[trolls|cool people]], or future [[pedophiles]]. RockstarChan is now known for their scene [[faggotry]] and their aggressive ways of handling the internet [[trolls]].
==History==
It all started in 2007 when some [[newfags]] from [[4chan]] decided to become [[oldfags]]. They decided to create the original RockstarChan which they had envisioned a [[hippies|peaceful]] and [[hell|Utopian]] society in where all 4chan users could enjoy their funny [[memes]] and [[YTMND]] fads. The poor [[jews|fuckers]] were in for a surprise.
===ZTC Elected Preisdent of the Nerds===
[[Weaboo|ZTC]] (now ''NekoArc'') the owner of some shitty server ran for office and [[cheating|won]]. RockstarChan became a part of the NekoArc Network and it was quickly apparent in the Summer of 2007 that cancer was slowly eating away at all the boards. With the recent creation of [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/List_of_*chan_boards#Mikuchan Mikuchan] and the [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/List_of_*chan_boards#NekoArc_Network NekoArc Network] more and more cancer was being spread towards RockstarChan. Soon the original [[mods|management]] we're sent on [[execution|vacation]] to [[Iraq]] and ZTC left the boards collecting [[cum|dust]] and [[cancer]].

===The First Furry Invasion===
Started in the early fall of 2007 due to the fact black person started spamming [[chans]], people on RockstarChan didn't know the impending [[rape|doom]] that lied ahead they decided to scoff off like the retards they are and the cancerous threads started multiplying. The blind new politicians of RockstarChan at the time didn't want any [[drama]] so [[furries]] began pouring in from all parts of the [[internet]] and [[Gaia Online]] causing small [[faggotry|fires]] to some parts of the boards. This went on for almost a year until the traffic came to a complete halt.

===The Second Furry Invasion===
Later in the year of 2009 the /b/ boards were home to many sorts of [[Furries]] and [[hippies]] who decided to make smelly campgrounds of armpits. Preparing an attack on the NekoArc Network in part due to [[bro|bros]] at the NekoArc Network were causing major butthurt to the furry [[communism|community]]. Soon [[b|/b/]] looked like a [[Shit|cesspool]] of "''Which furry are you?''" threads and "''[[Gaia Online]] gold rate hacks''". Apparent [[Bans|action]] had to be taken and [[Politics|by a vote of 22 to 1]] ZTC was [[Raped|impeached]] as [[moot|alpha mod]]. Soon the boards we're without mods and the [[derp|shit hit the fan]] when the network started being [[ddos|DDoS'd]] and overrun by furry [[failure]].

===Darkgrammer and Old Mods Return===
After all hope was lost the oldfag mods return with great fury and started swinging the [[banhammer]] uncontrollably hitting people left and right, occasionally civilians were killed in what is now known as '''The Great Furry Massacre''', some being [[loli|children]]. Many furries were lined up against a wall and executed by top RockstarChan mods.

{{quote|It was a bloody mess, the mods came in and started swinging the hammer[sic] away. Many of my [[bro|brethren]] were killed that night some that I had sex recently with. I couldn't fap at all that night...|A furry giving a statement in protective custody of Mikuchan.}}
{{quote|i dunno, maybe the fucking hitler rap on the front of the (/i/) board? ...the banners with pictures of [[Nazi]] chicks? (Drawn, all Nazis are [[Americans|inbred hicks]])... fail moderator is fail... suck on my [[cock]], while i go reset my router.|User raging hard about the new site style.
}}

===Rockstar Annexation===
It was soon realized that the [[newfags|new mods]] had taken over the [[imageboard|country]] and had impose there military [[penis|might]] on the [[basement-dwellers|anon users]] of RockstarChan. The annexation and [[holocaust|ethnic cleansing]] of RockstarChan was complete and the boards were given a new [[creampie|face lift]] along with some new mods and new [[Rules]]. NekoArc returned from [[Brb, soup|eating delicious ramen]], [[raped]] ZTC for what he did, and started doing shit again.

A new site look was created in order to celebrate our [[fail|victorious]] win over the furries and Darkgrammer was elected ''defacto'' Fuhrer..

===Jessi Slaughter's New Video===
On August 06, 2010 [[Jessi Slaughter]] [[troll|taunted]] /b/tards and the whole internets by claiming she was [[epic fail|back with a vengance]]. Claiming in a new [[YouTube]] video that she was back and had [[hacker|l33t haxed]] her friends account to post the [[obvious|secret]] [[steroids|underground]] video. It was quickly deleted by her [[sane]] friend the first 5 minutes posted by Jessi, but with the quick actions of RockstarChan [[lurk|lurkers]] they managed to save the video was re-uploaded [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-OQSWIyj1Q here].
