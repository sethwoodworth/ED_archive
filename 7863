<Finney> (am doing, Shene... quietly.)
<Popious> my gf is the one this whole article is about.  She's been harrassed all day long by 2 members of  the 
  site who created the page.  both are present here now.  she wants the w hole article pulled because a  number 
  of people are  not privy to the  knowledge entailed withing
<Popious> that includes many of her friends, family, and her church.  this could cause major problems if anyone 
  searches her web alias
<Sheneequa> [and Popious, when you're done, state so]
* MOnorailcat_ has joined #arbchat
<Popious> if at all possible, I would prefer to be questioned by someone i am more familiar with, Wattage. This 
  is due to the fact that  both people who harrassed  her are here now
<amp--> whyd she post on public forums if she didnt want the information known
* MOnorailcat_ is now known as Monorailcat_
<Sheneequa> Monorailcat_: Fix your fucking internet
<Popious> [done]
<Monorailcat_> sry lol
<Sheneequa> Alright
<Finney> Amp, shush. wait.
<Sheneequa> I'll take the floor next
* Monorailcat has quit IRC (Ping timeout�)
<Monorailcat_> opz
<Sheneequa> as you know I was one of the people that harassed your girlfriend
<Sheneequa> Monorailcat_: Shut up
* ChanServ sets mode: +o Monorailcat_
<Sheneequa> j/k
<Monorailcat_> D:
<Monorailcat_> lol
<Finney> May I ask who the other person was?
<journalist1> lul
* Monorailcat_ is now known as Monorailcat
* Monorailcat__ was kicked by Monorailcat (GTFO�)
<Sheneequa> Finney: journalist1 was the other
<Popious> journalist1 is the current handle
<Finney> thank you.
<Sheneequa> I harassed her in accordance with http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/IDIFTL and the Great 
  Drama Ammendment of 2005
<Sheneequa> also because bicurious girls are totally lol to troll
<Barrett> lol, precedent.
<Sheneequa> HOWEVER
-Monorailcat- if you have a question while it's semi-quiet type "/notice Sheneequa whatever" to ask her privately
<Sheneequa> This is old news in my opinion
<Sheneequa> and her picture doesn't really add anything to the site
<Monorailcat> No, not rly
<Sheneequa> and since Popious is contacting us nicely
<Sheneequa> I'm gonna say take down the pic
<Popious> thank you
<Monorailcat> It's kind of funny, but she's being nice
<Popious> hold up a sec
<Popious> i have a request
<Sheneequa> Popious: I may be sysop but these are one person one vote
<Sheneequa> and my opinion is not so strong as to just get rid of it, everyone else here has a voice
<Sheneequa> Monorailcat: PS you don't get a vote lollerchopper
<Popious> I wish to be represented by an impartial internet lawyer, Can wattage represent me in this trial
<Monorailcat> D:
<Sheneequa> Popious: hahahah
<Monorailcat> Uh, there's not much to represent
<Popious> i know but still
<Monorailcat> We're just about done here
<Finney> I agree, by the way. Minus pic, but not article. If people want their words to be private, the internet 
  is not the place to write them.
<Sheneequa> Does anyone else want the floor?
<logan> 4rl
<Monorailcat> Minus pic, find a replacement is my suggestion
<wattage> Your honor, I believe that Popious needs at least a fair chance.
<wattage> I would like to question my defendant.
<journalist1> ok
<wattage> In order to prove his character to the arbchat.
<Sheneequa> journalist1 gets the floor after wattage
<Barrett> your client.
<Finney> No one will be seated during....
<wattage> Now, my client, Popious, please state your Powerword: IRL name.
<Popious> Demitreus Alucard
-Monorailcat:#arbchat- if anyone wants a chance at the floor, type "/notice Monorailcat messagetext" to tell me 
  so it doesn't interrupt
<wattage> Okay
<Monorailcat> And plz, stfu now
<wattage> Now Demitreus, answer these questions as trustfully as possible:
<Sheneequa> loooool
<Monorailcat> Except you
<wattage> Do you believe that Jews did wtc?
<Popious> Yes
<Sheneequa> looooooooooool
<wattage> My jury.
<wattage> Do you see this?
<wattage> He belives the TRUTH.
<Finney> He's lying.
<wattage> This boy is no load of lulz.
<wattage> SILENCE
<Barrett> rabble rabble rabble!!!!!
<Popious> *coughs* JEWS DID IT! *cough*
<Finney> To cover that he's actually a jew!
* Sheneequa changes topic to 'I love wattage�'
* Monorailcat_ has joined #arbchat
<Barrett> <gasp>
<Monorailcat_> ugh
<Monorailcat_> opz
* ChanServ sets mode: +o Monorailcat_
<wattage> I rest my case, he has spine.
<Finney> May I ask something, wattage?
<Sheneequa> Monorailcat_: Imma ban you soon enough
* Monorailcat was kicked by Monorailcat_ (GTFO�)
<wattage> Go ahead.
<Finney> SO? What are you trying to prove???
<wattage> Me?
<Finney> Yes!
<Finney> What was the point? 
<wattage> Well.
* Monorailcat_ is now known as Monorailcat
<Finney> You're saying he has a spine... I'm glad. We need more people like that. But.
<wattage> He is a man of courage, trust, and determination, he believes the truth.
<wattage> Did Jews NOT commit the 9/11 acts?
<wattage> Y/n
<wattage> Y/n
<Popious> y
<Monorailcat> Finney: It means we don't pull a DJ SkeptiK and frontpage him
<Sheneequa> lols
<Monorailcat> oooh... wrong answer Popious.
<Sheneequa> what
<Sheneequa> that's the right answer
<Popious> oh sht, misread ^_^()
<Sheneequa> imma chargin mah lazer
<wattage> Understand my client is a good man, just trying to support his attention whore wife.
<Popious> sry
<Sheneequa> Oh
<Monorailcat> The question was did they NOT commit them
<Finney> But what's the point? Are you saying because he thinks Jews Did WTC, we should take the article down? 
  Or just, as Mono said, nto troll the shit out of him?
<Barrett> lol
<Sheneequa> I misread too
<Sheneequa> GUYS TAKE INTERNET COURT MORE SERIOUS PLZ
<Sheneequa> Imma taking the floor
<logan> i'd like to say something..
<Finney> Sidebar, I wish I was bisexual.
<Sheneequa> logan: after me
<logan> ok
<wattage> If he believes that jewsdidwtc, it means we should cut him slack. End.
<Sheneequa> journalist1: Why did you harass this bisexual lolcow?
* Finney shakes head.
-Monorailcat- http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Image:Courttrial.png
<journalist1> can I take the floor before question time
<Barrett> I for one am shocked - shocked! - at the treatment of this witness!
-Monorailcat- That's where the joke came from
<journalist1> similar to the other side
<Sheneequa> you can take the floor after logan
<Monorailcat> stfu or kicks
<Sheneequa> journalist1: Why did you harass this bisexual lolcow?
<Monorailcat> " /notice" me for floor requests
<journalist1> lulz
<Finney> I think that's an acceptable answer

<Monorailcat> looool
<Monorailcat> journalist1: YOu're up
-> -Monorailcat- Trhouble is I don't read the post before I hit enter...
<journalist1> ok
* Sheneequa awaits journalist1's answer
<Monorailcat> I think that was the answer
<Barrett> he answered.
<Sheneequa> oic
* Finney is like that angry republican who doesn't know when to shut up.
* Sheneequa changes topic to 'floor list: logan, journalist1�'
<journalist1> first off, we can see that all the whiny privacy issues dont apply here because she posted herself 
  on the internet.  so the real question is lulz
<journalist1> secondly
<journalist1> this is not a man of character
<Monorailcat> THere are copyvio and basic decency impications
<Monorailcat> But they're flexible
<Sheneequa> IMO there's not much trolling a man who believes JEWS DID WTC
* Sheneequa loses a point of order
<Popious> i'd like to interject and say that what she joined with t hat information, she misunderstood as a 
  private group, not a public
<journalist1> this is not a man of character, he has produced gingerkid scum: http://myspace-343.vo.llnwd.net/004
  82/34/33/482893343_l.jpg
<Monorailcat> What's to gain, after all
<logan> ok, i think that it is quite lulzy. also, even though her picture is in the article, there are no cocks, 
  buttes, etc shopped into it to make it demeaning or anything. also, she DID post on the nets, publicly...
<logan> and also,
<Popious> one sec
* Sheneequa motions for caucus
<Sheneequa> Caucus accepted
<logan> just because he agrees to the truth about JEWS, does not mean he's a good man. for all we know, he could 
  be playing into our hands for the picture to be taken down because his lolcow GF is having a netfit.
-> -Sheneequa- Can you put me on teh grnd floor list, plz?
<logan> done
<Monorailcat> PopiousL make it quick, this is getting repetitive
<Sheneequa> Point of order for using term netfit
<Popious> can you take me to ... uh,,  the finest restaurant, with a view of the golden gate bridge
* Sheneequa changes topic to 'logan Finney�'
<Monorailcat> omg Mediacrat sock
<Barrett> lol
<Sheneequa> guys
<Sheneequa> he just quoted mediacrat
<Finney> ...
<journalist1> hmm
<Sheneequa> this guy is fo ree-al
<Popious> okay
<Barrett> <gasp!>
<Finney> This might be declared a mistrial
<wattage> This guy is serious business.
* Sheneequa sets mode: +m
<Sheneequa> caucus over
<Monorailcat> srsly, stfu
* Sheneequa sets mode: +v logan
<Sheneequa> you have the floor logan
<Monorailcat> "/msg" me with floor requests peeps
<Sheneequa> imma mentoring Monorailcat, I'm not chair
<Monorailcat> logan: go
<Monorailcat> Or you lose the floor and get lulled at
<logan> >.> it is but a picture, of said popious and GF. there is nothing, IMO, demeaning about the picture. no 
  one has shopped it to include cocks, as i said, i do not see the reason for taking it down.
<Sheneequa> k
<Sheneequa> thanks for the opinion
* Sheneequa sets mode: +v Finney
<Sheneequa> Finney has the floor
<Popious> Perhaps logan is An hero
<Finney> Let's see, I've got a number of points to make...
<Monorailcat> I might point out: cock shops are MORE likely to be kept
<Monorailcat> As they're funnier
<Monorailcat> THe issue here is, is it worth the lulz to have it up?
<Finney> While I agree with Logan's logic, I think he is missing a certain point.
* Monorailcat sets mode: -v logan
<Monorailcat> lol
<Finney> I think we can all agree on the following:
<Finney> (a) the article is staying, yes?
<Finney> (b) Popious isn't a total douchebag
<Popious> i have no objection.  i  just  want the photo pulled
<Finney> The reason we are pulling the picture is NOT because of any privacy invasion or anything....
<Monorailcat> Ok, article stays, unanimous, /msg me if you disagree.  Anyway, carry on
<Finney> ...or even that it doesnt' really incite lulz, which it woul dwith a little creative photoshopping
<Finney> However, we are taking it down because of a comprimise
<Popious> no moar, plx
<Popious> thank you
<Finney> which would be more impressive if I could spell
-Monorailcat:#arbchat- quick note, not unanimous after all, be thinking about your vote
<Finney> If you argue with me, Pop, I'm going to photoshop the shit out of that pic
-Monorailcat:#arbchat- for total deletion that is
<Monorailcat> looool
<Finney> Is that what I'm understanding?
<Finney> That we pretty much all argee on?
<Finney> The article stays because EVERYTHING on the internet is for trolling.
<Finney> And the picture should, too, except.
<Finney> We're making a special case because of non-douchiness.
* Monorailcat_ has joined #arbchat
<Finney> And I'm done, unless someone wants to argue.
<Popious> well, no need to do a barrel roll, i just want the pool to close, if you get what i mean, I know im 
  not special or anything, i mean, sure im not rich and beautiful, but i ask of your humble merceh, and btw,

<Monorailcat> looool
<Barrett> Friends and fellow e-legislators, I originally intended to speak on behalf of this good man, and state 
  the case for the taking down of the page alogether...
<Barrett> ... however, certain developments have forced my hand in the other direction.
<Barrett> There is, for one thing, the revelation of his initial e-vandalism against the page, which is an 
  e-crime against e-humanity...
<Barrett> ...but what is more outraging is his recent, condescending outburt consisting of a string of ED 
  catchphrases.
<Barrett> This we cannot suffer.
<Sheneequa> I did not see that he vandalized the article
<Barrett> And thus I have no choice but to agree that the page should not only remain up, but be expanded. And 
  may God have mercy on his soul.
* Monorailcat__ has joined #arbchat
<Sheneequa> Okay wait
-> -Sheneequa- I think, just to be funny, is take down the article, but put up a different one with the same 
  info as what's there, plus this trial. Change the article's name to the Strawberry Shortcake Trial
<Barrett> That was the assertion by journalist.
<Sheneequa> Finney: COOL
<Sheneequa> wait

<Popious> it is in the historythat i did "vandalize it" but i mearly tried to remove what was dangerous to  have 
  up
<Sheneequa> okay a big point of this seems to be is he a poser or is he a citizen of the internet
<Finney> dangerous?
#arbchat You need voice (+v) (#arbchat)

<Popious> should this have been standard trolling, i would not  object.  This is something more than that though

  internet
<journalist1> = lulz!
<Sheneequa> Popious: So i herd u liek _______
<Sheneequa> Popious: Fill in the blank

<Sheneequa> he responded reasonably fast
<Monorailcat> looooool
<logan> nigra, where has u been? that IS trolling.
<logan> thats what it is
<Monorailcat> IRL trolling
<Finney> agreed
<Finney> not irl tho
<logan> just because it's your girlfriend, you get upset.
<Monorailcat> a) Does your congregation know your screenname?
<Finney> Why would a church-goer be on ED?
<Monorailcat> b) WHy is she a art of their church if she doesn't share their beliefs?
<logan> yarly
<Popious> trolling is something to be done  to irritate peoplefor fun.  when you actually endanger how  they 
  live their life thouhg.  thats more
<Popious> no
<logan> how they live thier life?
<Monorailcat> c) Would it not be lulztastic if their family disowned them based off bi-ness?
<Monorailcat> Answer plz.
<Sheneequa> I would like to answer
<logan> sir, i has been trolled before, some of it was faggotry, some of it was lulz. you have to move on.
<Monorailcat> All three, prefiribly
<logan> only when you stop and have a fit, has the troll won.
<Popious> all i'm looking for is the pic to be pulled
<Sheneequa> that wouldn't be lulztastic as we wouldn't see the after effects and she hasn't dodne anything to 
  deserve it
<logan> if you were really a net citizen, you'd know this
<Monorailcat> tru
<Sheneequa> I think as a show of good faith we should take the pic down
<Monorailcat> Well, a) and b) then?
<Sheneequa> He didn't really throw a fit
<Monorailcat> THe pic really doesn't add much
<Popious> a:no  b: do a barrel roll C: lol jews
<Sheneequa> Because churches suck
<Monorailcat> We need a replacement pic though

<Monorailcat> OMG that has possibilities
<Finney> a funny face on their bodies?
<journalist1> wait, i kind of disagree that this is ruining her life if the church finds out
<Popious> if we can remove the faces entirely, sure
