Soulja Boy
__NOTOC__

Proof positive that even the most mentally retarded [[niggers]] can attain high levels of [[fail|success]]. '''Soulja Boy''' is one of the 37 children Flavor Flav forgot he had. His real name is [[Gerard Way|DeAndre Ramone Way]]: a [[16 year old girl|seventeen year old]] [[Rapist|rapper]] of sorts, [[fact|and without a doubt the dumbest cunt]] in the hip-hop industry. He is the [[retard|genius]] behind that fucktarded song: ''' ''Crank That'' ''' that ends every line of every verse by stretching out what [[some argue|some think]] to be his lyrics.  His first, and hopefully last, album Souljaboytellem.com was released on October 2, 2007 and was purchased by [[Over 9000|millions]] of MTV addicted teenagers with no taste in real music. [[Soulja Boy]] is notorious for having dry, crusty [[cum]] on his glasses and oddly enough that [[cum]] spells out his stage name.

== Early Life ==
[[Image:Soujaboysr4.jpg|thumb|left|What Soulja Boy should be doing instead of writing "[[shit|music]]".]]
Soulja Boy was shat out mentally retarded and deaf by a [[Loli|12 year old mother]] named black person. At the age of three, Soulja Boy recognized his ability to say things repeatedly and [[Masturbation|play the skin flute]], earning him serious street cred. It wasn't until the age of five that he began to beat on random surfaces, such as [[women]] or desks, and to apply his repetitive lyrics to these "beats". In kindergarten, during recess, the [[children]] would [[Bukkake|crowd around the picnic table]] as he would make unnecessary [[noise]] and jerk his head to the side as if he had some sort of mental handicap. 

<b>UPDATE:</B> It has been recently confirmed that "Soulja Boy" is, in fact, profoundly mentally retarded. Doctors dicovered this was due to a large volume of his fathers [[Semen|semen]] in his system. Undoubtedly from his childhood days where his father would violently skull fuck him. However these events have also had positive affects on soulja boys career. His inquestionable talent of pleasuring [[faggots|other men]] has gained him superstardom.

One morning in 2007, Soulja Queer awoke with a memory of his kindergarten years and decided that it was time to make more money than a neurosurgeon from [[Harvard]] and let the world know of his musical [[skillz|talent]],  ''yet failed to use a fucking crack for FL Studio''.

== Criticism ==
Unfortunately, an entire handful of losers admire Soulja Boy's "music"(if YOOUUU can call it that), causing him to grow a larger [[head]] and a nose that could cause onlookers to mistake him for Pinocchio (or a Nigger Jew). The larger, more [[intelligent]], population of the [[world]] despises it. Soulja Boy is the target of much criticism, the majority of which he is described in simple terms, as [[common knowledge|having shitty music]].

[[Image:WTF lol baby nigger.jpg|thumb|right|Typical Soulja Boy fan.]]

In interviews, Soulja Boy has attempted to dodge his criticism, stating that "Those who enjoy my music do not have a knowledge of what real music quality is" and "My brain can only remember a handful of words so I am only capable of repetitive wording in my lyrics," he also added "[[You|YOOUUU]]!"

== The Lulz of It ==
As it so happens, Soulja Boy has achieved a degree of popularity amongst [[Jewtube|Jewtubers]] as a source of self-gratification and puerile humor. Because he is, on the whole, rather illiterate (and thus inherently funny, if not intentionally so), his [[feces|hit single]] "Crank Dat" now has [[over 9000]] parodies on Jewtube, including ones featuring shitty cartoons such as [[Spongebob]] and Mexican (moar like Dora the Deporter, [[amirite]]?). While they're all the video equivalent of [[tracing]], they do have the redeeming feature of more competent dancing.  A few samples...

==Soulja Boy the Gamer==

<video type="youtube" id="uHXBqo6RgN4" width="480" height="360" desc="Quite like the average nigger, Soulja Boy prefers games involving his favorite pasttimes of shooting people and stealing cars" frame="true" position="center"/>

Unknown to many, Soulja Boy is a [[Shit|highly proficient]] gamer, having achieved a single lifetime kill in [[Halo|Gaylo]] after [[9000]] rounds of playing. This is slightly better than the average 0 as is common for most niggers. In the final round of a [[GNAA]] tournament, Soulja Boy triumphed over his fellow ape due to the inability of his opponent to handle pushing buttons. Soulja Boy is known to [http://www.bungie.net/stats/Halo3/CareerStats.aspx?player=Souljaboytellem abuse the simplest attacks], a fact which scientists have attributed to his inferior primal instincts.

In addition, Soulja Boy has attempted to review the [[crap|beautiful]] [[shit|art]] game Braid, however this attempt came out as mindless drivel, much like Soulja Boy's music, which can be seen in his [[sarcasm|masterful]] video review:

<video type="youtube" id="xSXofLK5hFQ" width="480" height="360" desc=" 'They got this game right, fo people who smoke or people who drink like when YOOUUU drink beer and get drunk or if YOOUUU smoke weed and YOOUUU get high, like anything if YOOUUU just be getting fucked up.' " frame="true" position="center"/>

==HIS CHATROOM==

Since the start of his career Soulja Boy owns a Chat Room where his fans can discuss their opinions about his music. The chatroom has been a favourite place for raids. For moar information about this, see: ''[[Soulja Boy Tellem Chat]]''

== Trolling: Soulja Boy Himself ==

*his sites, inc. his MySpace, Blog, IM, Chat, etc.
*his CELL PHONE NUMBER
*HIS XBOX GAMERTAG ([[13-year-old boy|XBox fans]], YOOOUUU know what to do, it's Souljaboytellem).

==HACKED LOL!==
[[Image:Souljaboi-raids.png|thumb|How [[you|YOOUUU]] can help!]]
Around the 24th of August 2008, some Azn dude called '''Ko''' [[phish]]ed Soulja Boy's MySpace, YOOOUUUTubes and emails, and posted [[scat]] porn for all of Soulja Boy's [[retard|fans]] to see. Soon enough Soulja Boy regained control and then posted a video calling his [[personal army]] to take on the hacker. However this backfired and the [[internet hate machine]] sprung into action to defend our great hero Ko and [[DDoS]]'ed Soulja Boy's website in the process, putting the uppity fool in his place (27/08/08).

== Gay Niggers? On ''MY'' Internets?  ==

[[Image:fasb.jpeg|thumb|Anonymous formally apolagises to Soulja Boy.]]

On 09/03/2008, footage of Soulja Boy partaking in [[fag|gay nigger sex]] was leaked onto the interbutts. Anonymous, being the [[an hero|internet heroes]] they are, felt it their duty to spread this shocking new to the world.

{{quote|"Rumors around the Internet have shown that popular rapper soulja boy is the latest celebrity to spark a sex tape rumor however this sex tape is one of controversy, the sex tape is alleged to be a sex tape of a homosexual nature. DeAndre Cortez Way (born July 28, 1990), better known by his stage name Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, or simply Soulja Boy."}}

[[For great justice|For great justice,]] YOOOUUU can digg the article [http://digg.com/celebrity/Soulja_Boy_gay_sex_tape/ here.]

Soulja Boy later admitted to his habits in a YOOOUUUTube [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHXBqo6RgN4 video.]

{{quote|"I be doin' niggas. Real talk. I'm gonna do... uh... YOOUUU see all these niggas in this room right here? I'm gonna do all them niggas."| Soulja Boy himself referring to a room full of dudes}} 

=== He Don't Learn ===

Not long after the first, a second tape was discovered. [[lulz|Shock and disgust]] ensued.

==Thinking About Quitting?==

==2010: Soulja Boy Rips from ''Death Note''==
[[File:Soulja_boy_death_note.jpg|thumb|Just as planned.]]
On May 27, 2010, [[Sankaku Complex]] reported that [http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2010/05/27/rapper-soulja-boy-rips-off-death-note/ Soulja Boy sampled a theme from Death Note.] The song he made is "Long Journey" and he ganked "Near Theme."

Of course, the [[weeaboo]]s at Sankaku raged hardcore. They made up [[Aspergers|scenarios of characters from the anime series writing in Soulja Boy's name in a death note so he would get a heart attack.]] They also threatened to murder him in other ways, and saying things like "Black people stealing things? I never heard of that!" The weeaboos' smug racism and death threats grew. Some of them compared [[Vocaloid]] to Soulja Boy, saying how much better [[Anime|Miku]] was compared to him.

{{Quote|EVERYONE WITH A DEATH NOTE, WRITE THIS ****ERS NAME DOWN

DeAndre Cortez Way|PouiuoP}}

{{Quote|A crummy rapper ripping off a crummy anime.

Big shock there.

Only this website would care about this|Anonymous}}

Maybe Soulja Boy deserves an award for once for trolling the [[Wapanese]] into oblivion. Maybe? [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb1YEWUt2DE Definitely.]

==Weeaboo==
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFuwWRS6G-k Soulja Boy is an obvious weeaboo. In this song he raps about anime.] And in this one he raps [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkciPhhw-r0 about Goku.]

<video type="youtube" id="7b0oQkjup4Q" width="480" height="360" desc="Bitch, I look like Goku." frame="true" position="center"/>

==DeviantArt Account==
<strike>[http://ceosouljaboy.deviantart.com/ Right Here]</strike> - Deactivated

If his excessive love for anime could get any weirder, Soulja Boy blantly told the world that he has a secret deviantart account on his [[Twitter]]. As soon as every deviant heard the news, they came in rushing into his account flaming him with [[tl;dr]] paragraphs. He basically ignored all the "haters" at deviantart and continues living his fantasy life as a no longer colested weaboo. Although this can also be claimed as a case of epic [[trolling]] or a failling movement of gaining a new fanbase.
