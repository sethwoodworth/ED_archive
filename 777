BSD License
The '''BSD License''' is like the [[GPL]], only it gives corporations outright approval to charge you money for what was originally free.  Another distinction thereof is the habit of WRITING THE LEGALESE IN ALL CAPS AT THE FUCKING END OF THE LICENSE!!!  That, and it is shorter (a very strong selling point).

[[BSD]] people hate the GPL for overshadowing their license.  They state that their license is more free than the GPL could ever be.  Consequently, most BSD [[UNIX]] distros have minimal amounts of GPLed software.  But really, no one cares.
