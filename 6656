==IN THE BEGINNING==

One fateful day, an [[asshole|ingenious]] [[troll]] had an idea. "What if I posed a statement with an answer that [[God|cannot be proved true or false]]... but then ask people to do just that!" Thus, [[bullshit|prove me wrong]] was born. And for a few days, it was fine [[trolling]] indeed.

==But as fate would have it==

'''PROVE ME WRONG''' is now one of the shittiest [[troll|forced memes]] in existence, and moar of [[the cancer that is killing /b/]]. If you see a picture with the words "PROVE ME WRONG" on or near it, launch the [[sage]] bombs at full force.

This is the latest 4chan trend in which Anonymous posts a picture of bold text on a white background, preferably in MS Paint, proclaiming something he or [[Woman|she]] believes and says "PROVE ME WRONG". This starts a whole thread of [[trolling]] and other faggotry.

This however, was yet again corrupted by [[newfags]]. An even more recent spawn of this shitty [[forced meme]] shows [[retarded|clever]] anon posting a statement that can [[DOING IT WRONG|EASILY be proven wrong]], such as "there is no [[b|\b\]]." If prove me wrong is the cancer that is killing /b/, these motherfuckers are the goddamn UV rays.

Also a minor version of this is to post in bold text making claims about "Why don't you have a girlfriend" or something related. These are not truly considered as PROVE ME WRONG however.
