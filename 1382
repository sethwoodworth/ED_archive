Caturday is a [[4chan]] [[b/|/b/]] [[meme]] that involves mass-[[post|posting]] of images containing [[cat]]s and cat related objects, like kittens. It is by far the most glorious and holy of days for /b/tards. Though once performed only on Saturdays, it has since been declared that every day is Caturday. An average Caturday thread reaches around 300 to 400 posts, complete with [[retard]]ed 4chan catchphrases and "[[DESU]] DESU DESU". Despite being a wretched hive of scum and villainy, 4chan has an unlikely soft spot for cats and relentlessly [[defamation|shun]] /b/tards who post pictures of [[NEDM|Torturecat and Crushcat]].

==Origin of Caturday==

Caturday is supposed to be the day before Sunday, however, recently [[Anonymous|The King of Threads]] declared that "From [[Last thursday|this day]] forth, every day shall be Caturday." 

It was named after one of the planets in our solar system, Caturn. The day was proclaimed by the pagans as a day of worship and cat-related image posting many years ago, and this has been upheld by the many /b/tards who opt to take a break from [[Masterbation|fapping]] over naked 3 year olds.

Historically, Caturday has conflicted with [[loli|Loliaturday]] and the cult of [[tubgirl|Scaturday]] in the [[4chan|4chanian]] calendar, but both rivals have fallen out of favor since the [[b/-day|Great Schism]]. Caturday stands unchallenged today, and is currently the most celebrated day in the [[4chan|4chanian]] calendar, with the possible exception of [[F40PH]] Friday.

==Why [[Cat]]s?==
