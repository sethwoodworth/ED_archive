Lurker
[[Image:Alurker.PNG|thumb|A self-confessed lurker on the Gamingforce Forums]]

A '''lurker''' is a person who, well, um...lurks. [[bitches don't know|Don't know what a lurker is]]? Ok, [[retard]]. A Lurker has an account, is actively reading, downloading, and doing shit, but NEVER FUCKING POSTS. 

The IRL version of a lurker is that weirdass stalker guy who stares at all the girls, follows them around, then [[creepy|steals their panties and shit when they're not looking]]. 

Lurking isn't all bad, however. It mostly depends on the kind of lurker you're dealing with.

==Types of Lurkers==
===Rabid Reader===
This kind of lurker has [[no life]]. They sit there refreshing the forums just to see if anyone new has posted. If someone so much as farts they will know about it. 

This kind of lurker makes an amazing [[troll]] if they have a good memory as every [[An Herpo|moment of stupidity]] will be remembered, [[screencap]]ped, and ready for use when the time arises. If they  have a shit memory or are too much of a [[mangina|pussy]] to troll, then they're just a [[furry|waste of flesh]] who spends [[you|too much time on the internet]].

===Torrent Tard===
This lurker is there just to get free shit off others' resources and never contributes anything. This happens most often in [[torrent]] communities where the guy going "[[pirate|OMG! plz seed. kthnxbai]]" is usually same the guy who [[fail|never fucking seeds anything]]. This also happens a lot in [[Hentai]] sharing communities where people just fap but never upload and on 4chan with the bastards who are "[[asshole|downloading everything but contributing nothing]]" or who come to /r/ just to request that someone give them [[sauce]] yet never help others find shit.

These guys are fail [[Jews]] too stingy to part with a single red cent of their precious [[jew gold|bandwith]] or [[warez|time]] by contributing. Don't be one of these [[faggot]]s; it's less cool than being a [[furry]] as at least furries share their [[furry art|shit]] where these lazy fags can't be arsed to do that much.

===Got a Life===

These formerly contributing members of a community have stopped contributing because they have gotten their asses off their badly worn computer chairs and have [[winrar|gotten a life]]. This sort of lurker lurks just because between not [[fail|failing at life]], [[sex|having a hot girlfriend]], and [[money|making tons of cash at their sweet job]] they don't have time to post on your [[shitty]] little [[Livejournal]] anymore. However, they still like to check in just for the [[lulz]].

This kind of lurker has [[the game|won the game]]. Try to be like him.

===Starcraft===
A lurker is also a [[Zerg Rush|Zerg unit from Starcraft]]. [[Internets]] users seem to think it is funny to mention this when the subject of lurkers comes up. However, this generates no [[lulz]] and only serves to confirm that they do not know any-[[Zerg Rush|ZERG RUSH KEKEKEKE]]!


===Newbs & Newfags===

Ok, so these kinds of lurkers don't exist as most [[n00b|newbs]] don't know to [[lurk moar|shut the fuck up and lurk]] instead of posting. Seriously, if a single one of these [[asspie|rabid retards]] spent more than a week actually reading shit before [[no u|opening their braindead traps]] to [[lolcats|spew nonsense]], then the rest of the world wouldn't resent them so much. 

If you are a [[newfag]] or newb reading this, for the love of god [[lurk moar|STOP POSTING AND START READING]]! There is no such thing as lurking too much. In fact, [[DO IT FAGGOT|here is some good reading material for you to look up]]...
