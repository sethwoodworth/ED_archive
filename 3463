Grand Theft Auto
{{TOCright}}
[[Image:Death race 2 a.jpg|thumb|left|Not quite the original version but probably the inspiration.]]
The '''''Grand Theft Auto''''' or '''''GTA''''' games are nominated as "best gaims evar" by thousands of [[13 year old boys]] across the world for featuring childish and juvenile innuendo, driving, shooting, killing, pools of pixellated blood and other such shite. Though first thought of [[at least 100 years ago]], [[Luser|lusers]] who've no clue about what an amazing game is still consider these concepts to be "amazing" and "ground-breaking". 

All of the games in the series are very [[basketball|diverse]] and ever-changing, but your goal is always to drive generic cars through generic checkpoints and shoot or ram generic pedestrians and other cars with the aid of cartoon violence. Some would argue that killing people in a game is [[lulz]]. Regrettably, every one of you [[13 year old boys|13 year olds]] has to learn that it's only lulz if you [[Virginia Tech Massacre|go for the '''IRL''' high score]].

Unrealistically, you are able to kill/[[pwn]] thousands of people and get away with it. This pisses off the average soccer mom and [[politics|politician]]. In the 2009 installment, ''Chinatown Wars'', you can even make hundreds of thousands of meaningless virtual [[dollar]]s by dealing in meaningless virtual [[drugs]]. ''GTA'' is [[The Internet is serious business|SERIOUS BUSINESS]], the idea being that if kids or even adults play this game they are just about certain to go on random, unprovoked killing sprees. All kinds of violent events are blamed on this game, completely ignoring all of the violence in the world before it came along.

===Introduction===
The [[Old|2D]] ''GTA'' games were presented in birds-eye-view and originally released for the PC, then for the [[PlayStation]] and Dreamcast. They failed to generate any buzz in the world of gaming because they were totally out-of-date crap.

These 2D games are quite notorious for the worst handling of vehicles and player movement in possibly all of gaming history. Of course, to save time you're going to drive as fast as possible to get to where you need to be, avoiding obstructions and being as l33t as possible. However, even after years ([[Jesus|God]] help) of 2D ''GTA'' experience, you'd still remain a gameplay [[n00b]]. Driving any faster than 5 mph would result in an inevitable crash into a building or vehicle. Reason being the vehicle under your control moving faster than the display scrolls, so you could never see where the fuck you're heading. Not only that but (the [[BDSM|suffering]] continues), the terrible control system for the vehicle is not suitable for small children or the [[retard|differently abl]]ed: in reverse, you have to press '''right''' to go '''left''' and '''left''' to go '''right''' once back in forward. The graphics are total crap, remnants of the time when PC games really did have the world's worst graphics, so these games will soon drive you to become [[An hero|an hero]].

You played in ''GTA 1'' & ''GTA: London'' as a little blob of color that moved around farting, belching, punching, shooting yellow blobs and getting into vehicles. In ''GTA 2'', however, you were a little <i>black</i> blob of color with a white head, that could do the above AND jump! OMG! AMZNG!1 That's all that was different other than moar weaponriez.



===Characters===
The games had no original characters or memorable events. The only thing to be related to any sort of original character would be a terribly animated picture of a black person whose mouth moved a little bit that appeared when you answered his Blackberry.

===Story and Gameplay===
<youtube>MQGf3jRSBOc</youtube>
[[Image:GTA2.jpg|thumb|right|anotha bst gaim evar!!!]]

Plots were mostly absent from ''1'', ''2'' and the ''GTA: [[England|London]]'' expansion fad. From the start you were wondering what's meant to be done, and eventually found yourself answering one of many constantly ringing payphones. Answering a phone would result in you being given unclear instructions on a "job" you were then forced to attempt. These missions would involve [[Pain series|killing any amount of people]] and blowing something up. Yes, they're that detailed. Should you succeed you were given pocket change, and left to answer another payphone.

After you've rinsed and repeated this task; you're then bored and decide you're going nowhere in life. Soon after, you'll become [[An hero|an hero]]. They aren't considered very exciting, but you at least get new areas to unlock.

===Revolutionary Marketing===

[[Image:GTALondon.jpg|thumb|right|moar bst gaim evar!!]]

''GTA: London'' was a massive con. Most people in [[England|Britain]] bought this game [[Cum|cumming]] over the thought of shooting people outside Buckingham Palace.

After buying the disc (only worth using as a tea coaster) and putting it into their [[PlayStation]]s, n00bs cried when a message appeared on screen saying <b>"Un-fucking-lucky! You need to buy ''GTA 1'' and insert it first to play this!! n00b!"</b> Some became [[an hero]], while others actually went out and bought ''GTA 1'' as well.

''GTA II'''s creators also created a promo movie or some [[Shit|shit]] that involved real people making complete [[Jews|fools]] of themselves as they attempt to act. Beginning with a [[Bruce Campbell]] look-alike being chased by [[Niggers|nigrahs]], it ends with that same [[Bruce Campbell]] look-alike being assassinated by [[Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]]. Not worth watching. Period.

Here it is anyway.

<b>''GRAND THEFT AUTO I'', ''II'' & ''London'' = FAIL/100!</b>

==GTA III==

[[Image:GTA3 Box US.jpg|thumb|right|Teh b3st g3m evar?]]

===Introduction===
Many people believe <b>''Grand Theft Auto 3''</b> is the ''first'' in the series because they suffer from a disease which renders them unable to see the number 3. Set in "[[Jew York|Liberty City]]" , you played as some [[luser]] with no name who had his vocal chords ripped out as a kid. The NPCs didn't seem to mind him being a mute because he was such a badass, so would often have whole, albeit one-sided, conversations with him.

According to [[GameFAQs|GayFAQs]], [[Shit nobody cares about|his name is "Claude Speed".]]

[[Image:CrippleTheyHatin.jpg|thumb|left|''GTA'' IS NOT REAL LIFE. Do not attempt this and always wear a seat belt!]]
This is so [[you]]r character in ''GTA: San Andreas'' (if you're stupid enough to play it) can date "Claude's" [[girlfriend]] Catalina and be dumped, with some mention of how her new boyfriend is "Claude Speed". 

The Mr. X/Claude Speed controversy led to massive trolling of [[GameFAQs]] boards, giving the [[Mod|mods]] a field day.

===Story and Gameplay===
The game begins with a boring FMV that takes a couple of hours to show a bit of [[drug]] taking and bank robbing. 

If you wait long enough to discover that parts of the game are playable, you get to take [[Bix Nood|8-Bix]] and X through a 0.02-second journey on foot before they discover a conveniently placed car, complete with radio (happens all the time).

Mister X then somehow finds himself doing "[[Blowjob|jobs]]" and "[[Buttsechs|favors]]" for the Mafia (Don Salvatoré, Tony Cipriáni & Maria), a gang named "El Diablos" (El Burro) and some pervert named "[[Mario Brothers|Luigi]]" who runs a sicko strip bar.

[[Image:Ublwhitehouse.gif|thumb|right|Osama, moments before heading for ''GTA 3'''s Liberty City.]]

[[Lulz]] ensues with the [[MysteryBot|AI]] that is in every ''GTA'' to date causing pedestrians to [[Suicide|dive in front of your car]] more often than they avoid it.

For some bizarre reason which can only be the result of a drug cocktail enjoyed by Rockstar employees, some missions include taking photographs of fat men in diapers. '''I shit you not'''. Other missions involve the theft of [[Sick fuck|bestiality porn]].

[[At least 100|At least 100 years]] of hard labor later, the infamous bridge that was [[Osama Bin Laden|Osama'd]] at the beginning of this game is miraculously repaired, granting you "Staunton Island": five more square centimeters to run around in.

The game ends when you've killed all of your past buddies because someone told you to on the phone, rescued your [[Tubgirl|booty call]] from earlier in the game, and Mr. X and her walk off into the sunset (original, eh?). Mister X then puts a bullet in her mouth because she can't shut up and he can't say [[STFU]].

==GTA: Vice City==

{{rainbowsmall|THIS GAME CONTAINS LOVE FIST}}

''Vice City'' (''GTA IV'' would have made too much sense) is set in [[Miami]] of the 1980's and displays all manner of loud shirts, bad songs, and pastel colors to prove the point.

The promoted "stunning quality of graphics" became [[Shit|shit]] hitting the fan from the second the disc spun, with trees and walls appearing from thin air whenever the player character traveled any faster than 5 mph. Textures were as [[Fugly|fugly]] as ever.

In a monumental [[Fail|step forward]] for the ''GTA'' series, ''Vice City'''s main character had a name (Tommy Vercetti), and the voice was done by some actor (Ray Liotta).　''Vice City'' also gave the dedicated player the first chance to ride a [[motorcycle]] ([[OMG]] not featured in ''GTA III'')!

Notice the lack of lols in this section? It's because [[Lie|this game is fucking win]] - it's Sweet Home Alabama in a sea of Freebird.

==GTA: San Andreas==
[[Image:GTAHooker.jpg|thumb|right|Niggers love the white meat: from a much later take.]]
This time ''GTA'' wanted to be Boyz N Da Hood. Rather than an actual GTA game, this is just an angry, black Tamagotchi. You play as a pussy black person called CJ (moar liek [[blowjob|BJ]] amirite?!) who [[Pussy|chickens out]] after one of his brothers got killed, then has his mom killed by a rival gang. Long story short, you come from rags to riches, eat fried chicken, fuck [[insane]] women, eat fried chicken, [[Fag|get a pink Mohawk]], eat fried chicken, Blow up police cars with a M4, eat fried chicken, help Eazy E steal boxes from the [[Army|National Guard]] and have [[Buttsecks|hot coffee]] with Samuel L. Muthafuckin' Jackson. He [[Fail|never actually becomes a rapper in this game]], but other [[racist|people]] insist he is. Did I mention eat fried chicken (srsly)? This game also contains the failed meme/abortion known as [[OG Loc]], who is the [[Weegee]] to CJ's Mario. He makes no sense, is kinda disturbing and [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about him]]. Copying Weegeee even further, you have to go-kart race [[azn|Oriental]] [[Gentlemen|Gentleman]] Loc and near the end, CJ gets to shoot him, but instead he [[Facepalm|takes his rhyme book and his record company]]. Anyway, as the story develops, you go to Las-fucking-Vegas, shoot some azns, rob a bank with some azns, get [[rich and beautiful]], however your crackhead black person wants to stay at the hood and C-[[Gay|Jay]] is forced to go back to his dump. The game ends when you finally kill [[Biggie Smalls]] and the bad cop Tenpenny (moar like <s>Ten-Penis</s> dime [[No|amirite]]?). That didn't solve anything though, because [[Pwned|his mom is still dead and everything is still fucked up.]]
[[Image:Hot coffee.png|thumb|right|220px|Needless to say... [[Fap]] [[fap]] [[fap]]]]

Unlike black people IRL, the main guy can actually swim in this edition, though the question is what's the point when you're playing as a [[fat]] black person?

Also, you can get fat, <s>ride</s> steal bicycles and go to Liberty City. 

=== [[Controversy]] ===
''San Andreas'' generated a lot of [[lulz]] after a couple of [[13 year old boys]] found ways to make the lead playa [[fuck]] his [[Slut|girlfriend]]. Rockstar [[fangirl]] [[Jack Thompson]] became wet at the possibility of new lawsuits over the game enabling events such as [[fap]]ping over hot, sweaty, and pixelated sex. Rockstar pwned the prick's ass in ''GTA IV''; he gets shot in the head whilst screaming "Guns don't kill people, video games do!...BANG!" 

[[Hilary Clinton]] soiled her panties after seeing this, pulled out her tampon, and called for [[jihad]] against Rockstar.

== GTA IV ==

[[Image:GTAsign.jpg|thumb|left|The state of New York does not approve of ''GTA IV''.]]

'''''Grand Theft Auto IV''''' is the 10th or so installment in the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, and was promoted as a [[Unrealistic expectations|"turning point in video game history"]]. Set in 2008, ''GTA IV'' features [[Ragdoll Physics|on-the-fly ragdoll physics]], [[Fat Larry's Band|refreshing music choices]] and [[tracing|rl car clones]].

=== [[TL;DR|The Storyline]] ===

[[Image:GTAIV_RPG.jpg|thumb|right|What I expected...]]
[[Image:GTAIV_Taxi_hail.jpg|thumb|right|...what I got]]

In a nutshell, ''GTA IV'' catches up on the American media theme of presenting [[Serbian]]s as ultimate villains, because calling the villain [[Muslim|Achmed Raschid]] would cause too much [[butthurt]] whining, and between massive bombing and manipulation the Serbs can't do much about it. So the main character Niko Belic is a [[Serbia]]n illegal alien in [[New York City|Liberty City]]. Niko comes hoping for a new beginning, but finds himself becoming an [[Albania]]n, taking up a life of murder, crime, theft, drugs and all-around craziness.Oh and it features an annoying dick cousin who only wants to bowl with you and see BEEG AMERICAN TEETEES. Can you say bromance? 

Besides doing the normal ''GTA'' things, Niko does a few strange ones like chasing a laundromat owner and stealing a Honda Civic. <s>[[shit nobody cares about|Actually, dumbfucks, it's a 1992 Honda CRX]].</s>

=== Features ===
''GTA IV'' features virtual taxis, a [[Habbo Hotel|pixelated subway system]] twice as confusing as New York's, [[Airplane|Boeing 747s]] that never take off or land and endlessly keeps taxing on runways, cars you don't want to drive, people you don't want to hang out with, and dialogue you just can't enjoy. And, on top of all that, it finally points out how [[Fact|Americans are a bunch of fat, lazy motherfuckers]]. (As if we didn't know that already.)

NIKO MY COUSIN LETS GO BOWLING!!!!!!1!!!ONE

=== Characters ===
[[Image:NIKOMYCOUSIN.png|right|thumb|EVERY FIVE MOTHERFUCKING MINUTES]]
''GTA IV'' is not only known for the storyline and features, but of the characters, which are prone to fan-fiction and speculation.
*'''Niko Bellic'''- The euro-trash [[Russia|Trackpants]] wearing killer in Grand Theft Auto IV. He is [[Slave|the Irish mafia's errand boy]] and looks exactly like Sasha from Behind Enemy Lines and Victor Zakhaev from Call of Duty modern warfare.
*'''Roman Bellic'''- NIKO LETS GO BOWLING! NIKO LETS GO BOWLING! NIKO LETS GO BOWLING! NIKO LETS GO BOWLING! NIKO LETS GO BOWLING! NIKO LETS GO BOWLING! NIKO LETS GO BOWLING! NIKO LETS GO BOWLING! NIKO LETS GO BOWLING! NIKO LETS GO BOWLING! NIKO LETS GO BOWLING!
*'''Packie'''- Generic Irishman who drinks heavily yet is able to perfectly fire a gun.
*'''Brucie'''- A gay Jew FPS Doug ripoff who does steroids and [[Rape|fixes]] cars.
*'''Little Jacob'''- A Jamaican who talks like he has a dick in his mouth and most likely smells like shit. "Wha gwan me bredda."
*'''Dwayne'''- A black guy who wants to kill himself. Kill him instead of [[Hugh Hefner|Playboy X]]. Besides, the only thing Dwayne gives you is a change of clothes and a penthouse.
*'''Michelle/Karen'''- The [[Whore|local town bicycle]]. She pretends to be your girlfriend, but ends up being a double agent. 
*'''[[Stalin|Dimitri Rascalov]]'''- A Russian who looks just like Steve Jobs. He gets pissed when his comrades sell porn without him. You eventually kill him.
*'''Jimmy Pegerino'''- Useless Wop who betrays you in the end.
*'''Bernie Crane'''- [[Faggot|Fag]]
*'''Darko Brevich'''- The man who Niko vowed to kill. He looks exactly like Niko.
*'''Ray Bochino'''- Italian who owns an Italian restaurant...[[China|in Chinatown!?]]
*'''Vlad Glebov'''- Some dude who makes you throw bricks at Asian people and steal Honda Civics. You kill him also.
*'''[[Osama Bin Laden|Hossan]]'''- Roman's taxi driver. The only worthwhile character in the game.
*'''Jew'''- A dirty Jewish biker. Need I say more?
*'''[[Mexican|Luis Lopez]]'''- A Mexican who fucks up your diamond deal ''and'' your bank robbery.
*'''Gracie Ancelotti'''- Rich mafia boss's daughter, you kidnap her for a [[Rape|ransom]].

=== Expansion packs ===

=== Media attention and Drama ===
Even before it was released, ''GTA IV'' was causing drama in the tubes. [http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/13137/GTA-IV-Crashed-the-Internet/ So many obsessed] fat [[fanboy]]s tried to access the preview trailer at once they [[fail|crashed Rockstar's servers]], leading to much butthurt and bitching.

Of course, [[Jack Thompson]] jumped on ''GTA IV'' before it was released, calling it the spawn of Satan and the very tool that will unravel the fabric of modern society. Sadly, Jack didn't realize Rockstar wasn't in the mood for frivolous lawsuits, and immediately told him to [[STFU]] by tap dancing on the [[First Amendment]].

Does it end there? Fuck no. Multiplayer is perhaps the funniest retard haven this side of the internets. Free mode often leads to tears from 14 year old boys. It's "free mode", so you'd expect people's player characters to die while fucking around. But no, killing people in free mode is really murder and you should be executed if you do it! They have [[shit nobody cares about|deathmatch]] for that! 

[[Image:FPSdoug.gif|thumb|Brucie Kibbutz [[Headshot|in real life]]. Why does a [[black]] guy have a Jewish name?]]

=== Awesome New Features ===
Awesome new features of ''GTA IV'' include:
*Air Hockey - FUCK YEAH, OH TOTALLY!
*Bowling - HOLY SHIT! WHAT, OH MAN!
*Darts - YEAH BOIII
*Drinking and driving - OH, MOM WOULD BE SO PROUD OF YOU, GANGSTA!
*In-game comedy skits and television shows - YEAH, I WANNA SIT THERE AND WATCH A MOVIE IN MY GAME, DAWG!
*Low-brow humor- OH YEA I'M SO GANGSTA FOR SAYING "COME ON NIGGA!!"
*Recycled washed-up celebrities as DJs
*Music you can barely tolerate - FUCK YEA BITCH!

Oh yeah, and be a pedophile...

=== GTA IV XBAWKS 360 DLC ===
In order not to look like assholes who sold you the shitty half of a revamped game originally made [[at least 100 years ago]], Rockstar announced shortly after releasing the game, that they would be developing exclusive content exclusively for the ultra-exclusive Xbox360. This time, instead of playing with that Eastern European fuckrag, Niko, you get to plays with a white-trash, Hell's Angel spoof, with a heart of gold. It features an extra thirty seconds of gameplay, four hours of videos showing you how cool it would be to play, and none of the great things that the original game had (Why the fuck do I want to swim with a goddamn leather jacket on?).

The Ballad of [[Ghey]] Tony was released a bit later, and all the 13 year old GTA fanboys went crazy. The story follows this guy who works for a fag and carries out his [[rape|daily chores and bidding]], along with having to work for and later fight an [[Redundant|alcoholic Russian]] and his fuck-ugly assistant. The game was universally panned by [[niggers]] since none of them understood the plot and the controls seemed foreign because of their short term memory. The game was praised by many dick sucking video game reviewers and [[13 year old boys]] because they have sold their souls to adequate graphics, predictable plots and a story revolving around [[fags]]. Among the [[goatse|hardcore]] gaming community, the game was played for five years until the [[retards]] realized it was exactly the same as the first two, except with a [[gay]] title and 28 missions. The only true new addition is that there are [[Fail|CHAMPAIGNE DRINKING MINI GAMES OMG!!!11]]

The shittiest and/or weirdest part is that GTA IV and its two bastard DLCs involve $2 million worth of diamonds, who [[LOL WUT|the fag buys from some ship's cook and then the biker guy takes them and throws them in the trash and the Eurotrash guy has to dress up like a garbageman and steal them, but then he gets them stolen from him and some Russians get involved and...]] shit, now I'm confused. But, on the brighter side, you get to kill a bunch of [[Stereotype|Jewish diamond dealers]] and their thugs.

Like everything ever on the 360 the "exclusive content" stayed exclusive, and don't let any store tell you other[http://www.amazon.com/Grand-Theft-Auto-Episodes-Playstation-3/dp/B0036FDHT2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1282534994&sr=8-2 wise]

==GTA: Chinktown Wars==
This is the 2009 title for the [[Nintendo DS]], [[PSP]] and [[IPhone]]/IPod Touch, proving that Rockstar wants to expand their customer base to include [[Shotacon|children]] and [[fags]] (and [[You|combinations]] of the two), these being the only people to possess the console. Developed by [[England|Rockstar Leeds]], the game is shit and features a couple of [[England]]-derived place names but the usual right-side driving, which is just like totally [[gay]]. There were many fake pre-release videos and screens on the [[Internets|tubes]]. One example:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p82lbGyaYEY Here]

The game carries a "Licensed by [[Nintendo]]" screen. Nintendo apparently [[Do not want|did not want]] to release a [[Japanese]] version but ended up getting some third-party outfit to do it. Chinatown Wars features the best-named power-up in gaming history: '''Flame Retard'''.

==Grand Theft Auto V==

[[Image:1212481246242.png|thumb|center|600 px|''GTA [[IRL]]'']]

== ''GTA'' Wikis ==
Proving that everything needs its own [[wiki]], the ''GTA'' games have spawned at least three wikis ([http://www.grandtheftwiki.com/ grandtheftwiki.com], [http://en.wikigta.org/ wikigta.org], [http://gta.wikia.com/Main_Page gta.wikia.com]). The one on [[Wikia]] predictably features 1000% more [[stupid]], and just like on [[TOW]], changing minor details or telling people they're wrong when they are will lead to an instant [[flamewar]].

== ''GTA'' Forums ==
[http://www.gtaforums.com The GTA forums] provide a cesspit where 14 year olds can argue over which car looks or acts more like which real car, which weapons rate most highly, and stretch the definition of [[Easter Egg]] until the egg cracks. Much of the content is just strange, since ''GTA'' is not [[IRL|real]].
