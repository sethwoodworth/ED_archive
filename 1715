Taking '''Computer Science III''' means that you are a [[1337]] [[Hacker|h4xx0r]], among the likes of Mike Sandy, who ''almost'' [[DO IT FAGGOT|shut down the ED server]] but only managed to [[Fail|''slow it down'']], after SOMEHOW managing to find out the ultra-secret EncyclopediaDramatica.com IP address.

{{quote|So what about Dreamhost? Cant we trace the website's IP and I can use my [[skript kiddie|website hacking software]] to the hack the internet protocol address of the website and server its hosted on (encyclopediadramatica.com), then the site will go down. All someone has to do is provide me with an IP address of DreamHost's webhost or the IP address of the server the website is hosted on|Mike Sandy, oblivious to the existence of fucking <strike>nslookup cmd terminal</strike> That wont help at all. Network Topos Are More Helpful.}}
{{quote|That site will go down and ill use every programming skill possible to make sure it goes down.|Mike Sandy}}
[[image:Cloaked_ip.jpg|thumb|200px|ED's IP is cloaked :O or [[7 proxies]] ]]
{{quote|I tried looking it up but the program kept saying '''the IP was anonymous'''. The guy must have cloaked it so there must be another way to find out. As soon as I figure it out, I'll shut down the 9/11 part of the site as well. And any other parts. I take Computer Science III. I know what I'm talking about.|Mike Sandy, as anonymous kicks him in the crotch}}

{{quote|Alright I've managed to trace the guy's myspace. The guy's actually a kid, 13 years old and in the 8th grade but man he sure looks a lot older than that. He must be lying. One step in the right direction so far. Alright so far I've slowed the guy's site down quite a bit but havent shut it down yet.|Mike Sandy}}
In response to being warned shit would go down on him:
{{quote|Dont worry it wont.|Mike Sandy's final words lol internets}}
{{quote|I could've swore I was just able to hack into and shut it down. I guess you all are still seeing the actual site and not the error message I posted up a page back. ahh. i'll tackle this again tomorrow. [[epic fail|All I've managed to do is slow the site servers down.]]|Mike Sandy}}
[[Image:MikevsED.jpg|thumb|200px|How will ED survive?!?!]]
[[image:Noping.jpg|thumb|200px|That is one kick ass [[cloaking]] device]]
[[image:Wowthatwashard.jpg|thumb|200px|Wow that was hard.]]
We dodged a bullet there.

As you can easily see, a Computer Science III Expert like Mike is [[The Internet is serious business| SRS BUSINESS]] and, knows everything about [[teh]] [[internets]] (except Java, but who could possibly understand that, [[amirite]])
After attempting to hack ED, someone gave Mike his own IP address, and told him to start hacking it. As Mike kept getting booted off of AIM, he became increasingly frustrated. He retreated and began ferociously [[fapping]] to softcore [[pr0n]] on his IRL Tubes since his [[internets]] were broken.

==Computer Science III: The Book==
[[Image:Computer_Science_3_book.jpg|thumb|300px|ED: selling you [[Scientology]]]]
Due to the success of the Computer Science III hacking courses, a decision was made to put the book into print. You can purchase it here [http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-9978036-0008817?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Computer+Science+III], here [http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?WRD=Computer+Science+III&z=y&cds2Pid=9481], here[http://search.half.ebay.com/Computer-Science-III_W0QQ], or here for mega savings [http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?from=R40&satitle=Computer+Science+III&category0=]. Though, in all honesty, you get more [[hacker]] skills by putting your money here [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Encyclopedia_Dramatica:Support_ED].

==ZOMG HACKED!==
[[Image: HeDidIt.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Mike was so excited after he thought he hacked ED, he sent us this screenshot. Turns out his internets were just broken... again [[Fail]]<br>You can tell from the tabs in the screen that he was on http://www.brothersoft.com/downloads/website-hacking.html trying to find hacking software, and https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748 trying to download firefox scripts, to [[zerg rush]] the server no doubt, what a [[lolcow]]]]
After being [[butthurt]], Mike Sandy read up on CSIII and got 79/89 on his comp science test (whatever that means, I assume the 89 was after the [[retard|SpEd]] curve). He then believed he hacked the shit out of Encyclopedia Dramatica. In truth, he wasn't getting the main page because his internets were broken. He was so proud of his achievements, though, that he sent us a lulzy screenshot through facebook, then later bitched that the site "sucked balls" so bad it wasn't worth hacking.

==YouTube Alert==
Oh sweet [[Allah]], too [[fuck]]ing perfect..
<youtube>OMCfb5Bcpx0</youtube><br><br>
Apparently, having taken English 10 as well, he's now a contemporary of literary masters like Shakespeare and [[Tara Gilespie]].

[[goatse|Waddup my naem is Mike Siddy, Straight from the]] [[ghetto]].
[[rap|spittin rhymes]] while I eat my red [[ana|jello]]. 
Easiest class ever is [[English]] [[loli|10]]. 
Just as easy as lifting a [[Chikins|hen]]. 
So for my English midterm, [[retarded| you gotta study real hard]].
But, [[some argue|we know]] that the midterms are just full of [[fat|lard]]. [[ENGLISH_MOTHERFUCKER_DO_YOU_SPEAK_IT|Studying the vocabulary]] can get really tough. You gotta make all the flash cards <s>to get</s>, prevent that all from being rough. 
[[tl;dr|Macbeth was the thane, was actin real plain. 
And he gated Duncan to get the reign. 
<s>And the Macb</s> And the Macbeth Died. Cause he got fried.
McDuff Kick his butt, MacBeth got gut]]. 
Study for your [[STD|test]], they're [[the best]]. 
It takes some [[time]].
but its just like spitting these [[crap|rhymes]].

==Mike Sandy = No Friends==
"Our Mike" feeling the impending [[rape|lulz]], created an account on [[facebook]] to look exactly like [[gay|ghey]] Mikes. This was initially done to get [[moar]] [[pixpls]], but because Mike has a bunch of dumbass friends (and there's not many to begin with), they all (and then some) added Our Mike to their friends list. After 48 hours, Our Mike had moar facebook friends then real mike. [[butthurt]]? I think so. And to make matters worse, real Mike reported the account for [[TOS]] violation [[at least 100]] times. But [[noone]] cares about him.
<BR>'''!VICTORY!'''

==Mike Sandy's 1337 hacker program==

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include<superman.h>
    int main(void)
    {
       /*Now for the pwning*/
        int i;
        printf("I Take computer Science III, [[Lie|I know what I'm talking about]]\n"); 
        memset(&i,0,sizeof(int));
        return(i);
        /*This portion contains the actual payload */
        /*
             Payload
        */      
       /*Pwnt.*/
    }

The [[FBI]] are currently trying to decipher this encrypted source.  They're willing to give [[over 9000]] dollars to whom ever can decipher it.
