What he doesn't know can't hurt him
[[Image:Mouth Rape.gif|frame|right|Like.. OMG!  sure, [[Sema JayHawk|I]] let [[stileproject|Jay Stile]] throatfuck me at a party, and he may or may not have had [[STD|the clap]], but if my boyfriend doesn't know what happened; [[wrong|it can't hurt him!]]]]
'''What he doesn't know can't hurt him''' is an excuse used by self-righteous [[women]] to not take responsibility for getting their asses drunk and [[gangbang|screwing 15 guys]] at a party.  The idea is that if she lies about what ''really'' happened, it's absolutely <big><big><big>'''A-OKAY!'''</big></big></big>.  You know, because if he doesn't know that she had her holes slammed full of [[cum|cock snot]], it can't hurt him at all!  No [[sin]] whatsoever. Girls are usually taught this tactic in [[school]] by groups of [[16 year old girls]]. With the advent of [[feminism]] girls can now cheat on men cost-free because "equality" is basically having it both ways:

*'''If a man cheats on a woman: He's a horrible [[asshole]] who should be [[killed|shot]].
*'''If a woman cheats on a man: It's ''HIS'' fault because he didn't [[No one likes you|love her enough]]!

This will continue to happen until girls use it basically to justify everything.  She could get herself [[Cock Trapper|knocked up by some guy in a band, lie to her boyfriend that the baby is his and that he should marry her and support her child]], and she would still believe that no harm has been done at all.  Like they say "''What he doesn't know can't hurt him''" [[amirite]]?
