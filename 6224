'''Pac-Man''' is an [[Old|old-school]] arcade game [[famous]] for [[rape|pioneering]] the [[Video games|vidya game world]], being one of the [[over_9000|only]] games one could play back in the [[At_least_100_years_ago|long ago]], and for turning a generation of [[13-year-old_boy|kids]] into [[fat]], [[lazy]], unmotivated [[nerd]]s.

It [[some_argue|can be claimed]] that this game caused [[srs|serious]] [[autism|mental problems]] in a whole generation, but if that was [[truth|true]] we would all be [[basement_dweller|sitting in the dark]] chomping [[drugs|pills]] and listening to [[rap|repetitive]] [[shit|music]]...

...[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|wait a minute]]...

==Beginnings==
[[Image:Pacman_2600.png|thumb|To date, no game has been able to top Pac-Man's extraordinary graphics.]]
It became [[lame|popular]] among [[gay|heterosexual]] [[Japanese]] [[13-year-old_boy|teens]] despite its [[retarded]] premise. [[at_least_100_years_ago|One year]] later, it was brought to the [[America|States]]. Americans went [[batshit insane]] over the dorky little yellow [[cock|head]]. Numerous [[profit|merchandise]], including [[shit|cereal]], [[lame|board games]], and a [[TV]] show, left an indelible [[cum|stain]] upon [[you|pop culture]]. [[16-year-old_girl|Teens]] wasted their [[profit|allowance]] on this [[lame|arcade]] game even before they received it, completely forgetting about that [[Michael Jackson]] 8-track they've been [[asking_for_it|pining for]]. In [[fact]], [[truth|Pac-Man is partially responsible for the decline in 8-track sales by the turn of the decade]]. That's [[good]] since cassettes [[pwn]] them anyway.

==[[Feminism]] Attacks==
In 1981, [[lesbian|feminists]], high on estrogen and folk guitar, hijacked a truck delivering Pac-Man machines to [[redneck|hick]] towns (the last places in the U.S. to experience Pac-Man Fever), and used their l33t [[binary]] skills to re-write the code of the game to turn the male protagonist into a female. Word spread of this incident, as more and more feminists took the helm of the franchise. The new game, Ms. Pac-Man, was another huge sensation, even among men. This explains why [[bisexual|bisexuality]] and hair metal became prominent during the 1980s. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man eventually got married and gave birth to a kid, PacMan Jr., but [[noone]] gave a [[shit]] about that.
