'''OMGWTFBBQ''' originates from [[Something Awful]]; this word was originally used as a surname for one of the writers there. It was meant to mock the use of [[acronym]]s on games such as [[Starcraft]] and programs like [[AIM]]. It was popularized, ironically, when people began to say it as rejection of people who overused these phrases.
