Once again the /b/lockaders wrecked their annual havoc on Habbo. This time, however, it was Habbo [[Canada]] that felt their wrath. Achieving a triple kill, they repeated the ruins of [[The Great Habbo Raid of July 2006]] and [[The Great Habbo Raid of July 2007]].

==Reconnaissance Mission, July 11, 2008==

On July 11, 2008 a bunch of newfags showed up early because they were already shitting bricks about the upcoming raid.  Their excuse was "[[lies|reconnaissance]]."  Nevertheless, win was produced in the pool area and several swastigets were actually formed.

[[fags|Eurofag nigras]] also /b/lockaded the pool at Habbo.com in the early hours of the twelfth. Successfully /b/arricading the doorway, with many Habbos [[Incontinent Student Bodies|BAAAAWWWWWWWWing]] and many [[Waaaambulance]]s needed. Was epic success until the nigras decided that swastiget was in order and with defenses weakened the Habbo Mods took advantage and stormed the pools with the Anti-AIDS b&hammer. Nigras were lost and Habbo Mod were prepared for the main raid later. Habbo.com recon was lulzy, but fail.

==Prologue==
[[Image:Poolsclosedposter.jpg|thumb|Nevar Forget: 08]]
The plan was conceived rapidly and went into effect even moar rapidly. [[nigras|Scouts]] deployed in the Canadian branch of Habbo Hotel returned telling [[lies|great and wonderful tales]] of how habbofags in Canada swam in relative peace, undisturbed by the great black plague that is [[nigra|nigradom]]. Of course, this meant they were free to be affected by an even more terrible plague; that of AIDS.  Oh exploitable! Habbo.ca was determined as the next target and preparation began immediately. Much propaganda was spread and nigras everywhere began [[shoop da whoop|charging their lazers]]...the raid was set to occur at 5:00 pm EST on 7/12/08. Many more scouts were deployed, and the news was naught but good. Everyone had to agree; this raid was going to be fucking [[epic]].

To better prepare newfags for the raid, a tutorial thread was created by veteran nigras.  Also, LOLtoast released an updated version of his [http://files.filefront.com/LOLToasts+Raid+Tool+v7zip/;11015234;/fileinfo.html raid tool] with many new features enabling nigras to better keep track of mods and other nigras, as well as a mimic tool and a built-in nigra radio. In turn, the radio provided aid in the form of the DJs, who provided audio [[AIDS|aid]] so newfags knew what the fuck they were doing, what rooms needed /b/lackup, and what rooms the mods were swinging the [[ban fucking everyone|b&hammer]] in, plus music.  For the first year ever, all nigras were dancin' to the same mean beat.

==A New Raid==
The [[rape|raid]] was set to occur at 5:00 pm EST but, as always, newfags showed up early.  Nevertheless, when the raid began, [[nigra|nigras]] swarmed the hotel, almost immediately taking complete control of [[all your base|everyfuckingthinginsight]]. Several notable swastigets were formed in the picnic garden, and smaller swastigets were formed in other rooms. Nigras everywhere rejoiced, sensing an early victory.

==The Mods [[rape|Strike]] Back==

A couple hours into the raid, the Canadian [[nazi|mods]] realized what was happening and decided to do something about it.  [[centipede-filled vagina|"Nigras?  In my hotel?" they cried.  Alas, it was more likely than they'd thought.]]  However, after the initial shock and [[Incontinent Student Bodies|BAAAAAWWWWWWW]] wore off, they pulled their shit together.  The High Dive Pool Deck became insta-b& to [[nigra|anyone with a 'fro]]... including several habbofags, leading to win in the form of [[habbo hotel|racial profiling]] accusations.

==Return of the Nigras==

Hours after the main assaults nigras still joining the raid for great justice. Due to [[France|failed]] organization, /b/locks and swastigets were less epic, but still [[lulz|lulzy]]. A group of brave [[nigras]] blocked the picnic garden for hours on habbo.com

Two days after the main assault raids were still going on, the US Habbo Hotel ended up having to shut the site down for maintenance which resulted in epic win.
