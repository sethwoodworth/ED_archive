Philosopher Attack
[[Image:Philosopher pillage.jpg|thumb|right|A good example of such an attack.]]

The '''Philosopher Attack''' is a type of [[flame war]] where a terminally bored, yet well educated person or group ambush an innocent bystander or group, who were just minding their own business. This can occur as premeditated invasion, when the group is organized and has a home somewhere on the [[Internets]], or rarely spontaneous, when a philosopher is driven to madness and goes [[kamikaze]].
