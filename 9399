'''♥''' (alternatively: <font color=red>♥</font> or '''<3''') is the [[Pun|beloved]] character of choice for [[emo]]s, [[scene]] twats, [[Japanophile]]s and all around [[fuckwit]]s. The ♥ appears primarily on [[MySpace]], [[Jameth|fagging]] up thousands of MySpace pages. You are probably an emofag as well because you managed to find this page.
You may have noticed that [[common knowledge|♥ looks nothing like a heart]], human or otherwise. This is because ♥ actually is a representation of engorged [[cooze|vaginal]] lips. ♥ was given the euphemism ''heart'' by prudes who thought ''engorged vaginal lips'' was too [[verbose]]. No, you [[faggot]], it was the symbol of the sylphium seed, which was [[birth control]] in ancient [[Greece]], hence, the association with hearts and [[love]].

== The ♥ Phenomenon ==
[[Image:Man the heartpoons.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Man the harpoons|MAN THE ♥POONS]]]]

Every [[16 year old girl]] persists in using the ♥ character, despite the fact that it makes it blatantly [[obvious]] that they have [[idiot|shit for brains]]. The dark [[Tentacle rape|tendrils]] of ♥ have spread into all [[social networking]] websites, and is thoroughly, as you read this, undermining any respectability that the [[internets]] once had. This has become a problem for the [[pedophile|loners]] who lurk on MySpace looking for teenage girls to [[masturbate]] to or [[lemonparty|old men]] looking for girls to [[rape]] due to the fact you can't see the name of the user until you enter the page. You are then picked up by a profile tracker and then it's all over, sell your MySpaces.
 
In various MMORPG's, people are conveyed and interpreted by their level of suit. In this case, ♥ means a person is kind, loves the social aspect and converses with many people, and gives out free items. Naturally, this means [[pussies]], [[fags]], and [[retards]] who gives out worthless [[shit]] to try and make their way up a non-existent social ladder.

== Fuck The ♥ ==

The rapeage of the internets caused by the standard [[emo]]'s character of choice is, as of now, irreversible.  [[LOL]] [[Apocalypse|APOCALYPSE]]!

==How To==

You can experience &hearts; by typing '''&amp;hearts;''' in your [[HTML]] code.

You can also experience &hearts; with alt+3.

== ♥ Hitting the Mainstream in the States ==

The [[Dance Dance Revolution]] series, followed by the thoroughly mediocre [[scene|independent]] film ''I ♥ Huckabees'' (pronounced Eye-Heart-Huck-A-Beez) brought ♥ into the mainstream in the USA. And somehow still, nobody gives a fuck.

== Shitty Search Engines ==
