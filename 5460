'''Modern Warfare 2''' also known as '''[[Wrong|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]''' to COD fags and '''Camp: The Game''' to assholes who don't wanna admit that they just can't play the fucking game.  It is the highly [[Fail|successful]] sequel to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and the [[Lie|best game ever]].  The game was commercially [[Shit|successful]] and universaly praised by [[Fags|critics]] for it's [[Lie|engaging gameplay,]] [[Ugly|beautifully rendered and realistic environments,]] [[Small|blockbuster campaign,]] and the [[Wut|$200 pair of night vision goggles that came with the super special edition of the game.]]  Of course it's the best selling thing to ever hit the [[PS3|PS3,]] [[Xbox 360|XBOX 360,]] [[Pc|PC,]] [[Wii|Wii]] and [[Dreamcast|Sega Dreamcast.]]  According to the sales records, you and everybody in your home own at least two copies.

==[[TL;DR|Story]]==

Taking place [[Forever|5 years after]] COD 4, you play as a [[Final Fantasy|gajigabizillion different characters with no fucking personality whatsoever.]]  You run around the world, fucking up the days of 3rd world country soldiers who just want to eat some shit that's not radioactive or filled with agent orange.  About halfway through the game, shit starts hitting fans and everything goes wrong:

*'''Level #4:''' You go undercover as a [[Douche|Ruskie]] and shoot a bunch of people at the airport, before getting [[Karma|shot in the head yourself.]]
*'''Level #6:''' The Whitehouse is invaded by Russians who [[Buttsex|sodomise]] Barack Obama repeatedly.
*'''Level #10:''' You rescue [[England|Captain Price]] from a prison that he's in for no reason.
*'''Level #11:''' You defend Burger King from Russians abusing free refills at the [[Cocaine|Coke]] machine.
*'''Level #12:''' You begin to regret this when he launches a nuclear missile at the International Space Station.
*'''Level #14:''' You win back the Whitehouse and take advantage of [[Barack Obama|Obama's]] corpse.
*'''Level #15:''' Commander Shepherd is evil and fucks Roach and Ghost over via [[Pwned|gunshot to the balls.]]
*'''Level #18:''' You hunt down Shepherd and put a [[Win|knife in his eye.]]
*'''Level [[At Least 100|#100:]]''' ????
*'''Level [[Over 9000|#9001:]]''' Profit for [[Assholes|Infinity Ward.]]

There's a shitload of other useless levels that have no relevance to the story or anything else in [[Wikipedia|existence.]]

==[[Retard|Special]] Ops==
Just shitty parts of the campaign with timers put on them to make them more [[Stupid|challenging]], beating the times earns you [[Manly Tears|manly stars]] to attach to your cock and impress [[Your Mom|the ladies.]]

==Multiplayer==

|Woah lighten up its just a game|what typical faggots say after people yell at them for [[camping|camping]] their asses off.
|So what that we lost, Im still better than you| what every body says after losing.
}}

Knowing that the [[ADD|ADD]] ridden [[Retards|customers]] would shift their attention to something [[Tits|else]] at the conclusion of the five minute campaign, Infinity Ward decided to create an alternate game mode where the Aspies could frolic amongst each other without leaving the safety of their Grandmothers' basements.  Proving a success to antisocial-fags and [[Cripple|paraplegi-fags]] with access to the tubes, tens of thousands of the gullible consumer whores gather each day to partake in an ancient ritual known as [[L33t|"Pwn1ng N008s"]]

Modern Warfare 2 features a [[Shit Nobody Cares About|wide variety of weapons and perks]] so you can [[Lie|tailor your loadout]] to suit your [[Camping|gameplay style.]]  Common play style architects include:
*'''Camper:''' The second most common player type, campers hide like a like [[Pussy|bitch]] in the corner until an unsuspecting victim turns their back and provides the player a chance to make his [[Buttsex|move.]]  Used weapons include Assualt rifles for a moving kill, sniper rifles for a [[Idiot|stationary target]] and the combat/throwing knife when (He thinks) there are no enemies around and to brutally embarress their prey.
*'''Booster:''' Exclusively for Trolls and people who suck at direct combat, they work from the shadows, building up a kill streak until they get some banhammer of a booster to [[Win|rape]] their enemies/teammates.  Commonly used weapons include sniper rifles, claymores and whatever else can be used to kill from a safe distance.
*'''Sniper:''' [[over 9000|The least common class]] [[lie|and the only one possessing]] [[L33t|skillz,]] they enjoy seeing the enemy's cranium bursting into a crimson cloud of pwnage.  Used weapons include sniper rifles and combat knives for [[Lulz|ultimate humiliation.]] (Often fall into the category of camper)
*'''Noob:''' The most common type of player, they employ the tactics of all previous types, but [[Fail|fail]] in successfully executing said techniques.  Common weapons include grenades, the biggest assualt rifle/pistol they can find (n00b tube included), RPGs, l33t snip3rer r1fles and [[13-year-old boy|screeching pre-adolescent mic spam.]]
*'''Predator Missile:''' [[ALL CAPS|AN UNHOLY BEACON OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION THAT EXISTS ONLY TO FUCK YOUR SHIT UP, IT IS HEAVEN, IT IS HELL AND IT DOES NOT MISS!!!]]
*'''Griefer:''' A player who can give two shits less and pisses off other players for the lulz. You can easily spot griefers by seeing anyone spawn on a hardcore match with a RPG.

==Modern Warfare 2 [[White|Playas]]==

[[Image:Call_Of_Duty_Average_players.png|frame|right|Your average CoD [[Fag|players.]]]]

The average [[Fag|player]] is a disgruntled 20-something year old with a [[Fetish|fetish]] for War and almost always has a [[Goatse|deep]] loathing for [[Gook|Koreans,]] [[Nazi|Germans,]] [[Asian|Vietnamese,]] Arab or [[Everybody|anybody else who Americunts have waged war on in the last million years.]]  When not reading through war hero novels, reverting changes made to the Vietnam War Wikipedia page or just going to [[Anti-lulz|anti-abortion]] rallies to sure up the numbers of new [[Fetus|troops,]] you can bet your ass they'll be screaming at some 10 year old kid on Modern Warfare 2 and telling [[Right Wing|bleeding heart]] stories about soldiers they never met.  Another [[Shit Nobody Cares About|interesting]] part of the [[Idiot|MW2 player's]] psyche is that they truly believe playing the game has made them [[Retarded|into a trained killer with senses honed many times greater then the average man and the ability to silently take out an entire room of armed Russian extremists with nothng but a combat knife.]]  If ever you see one in the street, (Identifiable by a grim expression, at least one article of khaki clothing and a habit of shooting any non-black person minorities a death stare) please prove them wrong with a swift [[Falcon Punch|kick to the testicles]] and a gunshot to the head.

==Expansion Packs==

'''[[Clit|Stimulus]] [[sack|Package]]'''

Things were good at Infinity Ward; Modern Warfare 2 had sold like black person in the 18th century and the offices were lined with gold and jewels.  But all was not well; the pathetic amount of multiplayer maps included on MW2's disc were [[Fail|failing]] to capture the attention of consumers and they threatened to go back and play a [[Team Fortress 2|better game with more maps]], rather than fuck around on boring dirt mounds for barely valid bragging rights.  So the head [[Nerds|warlock programmers]] got to work on making 10 [[Crap|new]] maps to satisfy the [[Cocks|needs]] of the players, a good portion of which were unoriginal ports of maps from [[Old|previous]] games.

Of course, the retards at home ponied up their precious [[Jew Gold|cash]] for the craptacular map pack, and never complained again lest they be raped by the [[Lazy|overworked]] level designers at Infinity Ward.

'''[[Copypasta|Resurgence Pack]]'''

After discovering that they didn't have enough traded in gold fillings and [[Bling bling|diamond plated wheel rims]] that the lowly peasants traded in for the last map pack to satisfy their Jewishness, they once again [[Fisting|reached into]] their magic portal to the dimension of best selling shit and pulled out 5 moar maps (only 3 of which are actually new), and threw them up onto the game marketplace for a few billion dollars.  No guesses as to what happened next; every [[Truth|idiot]] who owned the game and even a couple who didn't proceeded to buy several copies each and fap to the slightly more varied selection of [[WOW|dungeons to earn sweet XP in.]]

<center>He's a stealth clown...[[Wut|yup.]]</center>
<center>{{frame|<youtube>61lh9brAkI4</youtube>|color=#AEC793}}</center>

{{quote|I love this game and I bought both map packs. I like the first map pack, but I am not crazy about the second one that much, although I don't regret buying them at all. You have to think about the value that you get for the money. I have spent $89.99 on the game and dlc and have logged close to 12 days playing time between the single player and multiplayer. Thats about $0.32/hr for me to play the game. Better than the price of admission for any movie.

Sure, there are problems camping the game and there are things I wish they would fix. (I don't care about boosters...they are fun to hunt down and the hate msgs that you get from them afterword are fun too)

For the amount that people complain about the game (hacks, boosters, glitches...mostly boosters) there are always a ton of people online. I can't wait for Black Ops to come out and hope that it is as good as MW2 is.|Lucky26|}}

==We Fucked What Up?==
<center>'''The [[Azns|majority of MW2 players]] use hacks'''</center>
<center><youtube>NYGlWjIKoY4</youtube></center>
Sometime [[Last Thursday|last Thursday]], Infinity Ward decided to release a patch for the Xbox 360 that was to coincide with the new Stimulus package, in order to make online play and matchmaking more [[retarded|fun]]. The only problem was that the morons at IW were unaware of how beta testing, a timetable or synchronization, worked and [[Truth|fucked up royally in the process]], releasing the DLC [[Divide by zero|before the Patch]]. What followed next could only be described as lulz of epic proportions; matchmaking was for the most part rendered inoperable, and gamers everywhere found themselves unable to find any matches or enjoy the [[shitty|awesome]] fifteen dollar DLC they just downloaded. Even gamers who refused to pay for this shit [[Win|got nailed by the same bug]]. Infinity Ward is now scrambling to fix their fuck up, but in true retard fashion, they're getting nowhere fast.

UPDATE: After a month of non-stop [[Lemon party|shenanigans]] and resignations from the company, IW has finally announced that a new patch is coming out that will fix the recent fuck up with the Xbox 360's matchmaking. Only time will tell if the patch in question actually fixes the problem or leads to more [[lulz]].

==How to Troll MW2 [[13 year old boys|Fanbois]]==

Seeing as how every  MW2 player in the whole world has some sort of [[Retard|retardation/]][[Aspie|emotional sensitivity problem/]][[Vampiric Spektor|aggression enhancing tumor sticking out of their cranium,]] their feelings are about as stable as those of a [[Old|35 year old]] British Virgin on the [[Period|rag.]]  This makes trolling them not only easier, but also gives better results as they aren't used to being picked on from inside their [[Basement|airtight, plastic bubble.]]
* Mention [[Halo|Halo]] in any positive way, the Warfaretards will proceed to engage in a heated argument with you about MW2's realistic graphics and large player base (Half that of Halo 3) until their crusty brains will overheat and they proceed to team-kill you until the match ends.
* Spam your n00btube infinitely by using Scavenger (walk over bodies to pick up 'nades) or One Man Army (switch classes to replenish 'nades).
* Team-kill someone multiple times until they start sending you retarded messages about playing the game [[Doing It Wrong|properly]], post on Youtube and give a username so everybody can [[Rush|troll rush]] them on Ecksbawks LIEV.
* Make any kind of [[Ghey|gay]] [[Chris Crocker|joke,]] MW2 fans are notorious fag bashers and insinuating that they play for the other team will make them furiously masturbate to girl only porn [[Stupid|(But not lesbian porn 'coz homosexuality is wrong)]] until all doubt of sexuality is [[Aborted|washed]] from their minds.
* [[Griefing|Grief]] in any form, their underdeveloped [[Caveman|caveman]] brains will catch fire as they struggle to comprehend what's happening.
* Mention any similarites between the [[Battlefield: Bad Company 2|Battlefield: Bad Companies]] and MW2, yeilds same results as mentioning Halo times ten.  Extra points if you say that Jew/[[Texas|Haggard]] could kick [[Pussy|Soap's/]][[England|Ghost's]] ass.
* Say anything about their Mom/Dad, it doesn't even have to be [[Offended|offensive,]] they'll still get defensive over someone else talking about the woman/man who [[Tits|breast fed/]][[Buttsex|took care of]] him his whole life.

'''The MW2 Trolling Game:''' The only thing MW2 is actually good for, find a couple of [[Fags|friends]] online and enter matchmaking, have your mics and troll faces ready.  Get a pen and paper, write down the rules and prepare for the grief of a lifetime.
*'''Team Kill:''' 1 Point
*'''Camp Kill:''' 1 Point
*'''Get Angry Reply: (Insulting/Arguing)''' 1 Point
*'''Get Furious Reply: (Yelling)''' 2 Points
*'''Get Team Killed: [[Duh|(By Pissed Off Player)]]''' 3 Points
*'''Box Teammate Into Corner:''' 2 Points
*'''Boxed [[Moralfag|Teammate Doesn't Kill You to Get Out:]]''' +5 Points
*'''Booster Kill:''' 5 Points
*'''Successfully Use Hax:''' 5 Points
*'''Cause Rage Quit:'''  10 Points

==The Infamous 4th Level: "No Russian"==

One day while monitoring playthroughs of every violent video game released that month, the [[Christians|concerned mothers]] at FAUX News came across the 4th level in MW2, in which you gun down hundreds of [[Shit Nobody Cares About|Russian civilians]] and the Russian S.W.A.T team who [[Police Brutality|came to defend them.]]  Bricks were shat and the FAUX News team called head of the Earth Defense Force, [[Jack Thompson|Jack Thompson.]]  Every douche with a camera flocked to the gates of Infinity Ward's castle and waged a five year war on the villains [[Lie|clearly]] guilty of [[Freedom of speech|crimes against humanity.]]

Opposing comments from actual players, who clearly disprove FOX News' accusations that [[Jack Thompson|violence in video games can impede social development.]]

{{morphquote|5|background-color: white; width: 80%; height: 200px;|font-weight: bold;
|I shot them once and watched them and went up to them and i went up to them and chot their leggs off and them i tbag them and then i watch them die slowly|A fine youth from GameFAQs.

|Is it a bad thing if this level﻿ gave me a boner :( |A sadist has been catered to.
|hey look civilians. pop pop pop. There now you're dead. Oh look some more. You guys want some. here have some. Oh you too. here, share this around. Give some to your friends. Fun for the whole fucking family. Not enough yet. Die some more you little bastards. Hey wait. [[Pedophile|why are there no children in this airport. I wanna tbag some children]]. At least I can.. WTF why did Makarov just shoot me?|Thoughts running through the players head whilst enjoying a good game of No Russian
}}

Eventually all the Christ-loving skanks at FOX News gave up when the great warriors of Infinity Ward [[For Great Justice|plugged up the bitches' holes with their chrome plated cocks of justice,]] keeping Tacgnol at bay and holding off [[Catnarok|Catnarok]] off for another thousand years.

==[[Battlefield: Bad Company 2|Battlefield: Bad Company 2]] vs. MW2 - Battle for Mount OlympFPS==

For Millenia the war has waged about who is the better FPS, Battlefield or MW2.  Modern Warfare fags argue that the [[Fact|fact]] everybody is playing MW2 and not Battlefield proves that [[Bullshit|MW2 is better.]]  Battlefield fans however argue that [[Truth|the fact MW2 players aren't all playing Battlefield is the reason it's better.]]  This once and for all proves that Modern Warfare 2 is a pile of shit game with no players over the age of 13 that aren't fucktarded and [[Yes|the declining quality is due to the fucktards who play it and not the game itself.]]
