The Great Metrowyn Raids of 2010
On the 8th day of July, 1:50 PM, a blog site by the name of Metrowyn.com (Now shut down) (more like metroFAIL, amirite?) made an article stating that [[4chan]] should be [[censored]], monitored, or shut down altogether. They first stated the obvious by saying that 4chan was "One of the most disgusting and dangerous site on the internet today", continuously [[trolling]] [[4chan]]. Unfortunately for Metrowyn, they were unaware of [[anonymous|Anon's]] ability to never forgive or forget; a raid  and [[DDOS]] was issued on their Facebook and website.

==History==
The [[blog]] itself is a news-orientated blog for the Western [[New York]] community. It is presumed that before the 4chan article, they issued articles about [[shit nobody cares about|Broadway shows or sports news that pretty much everyone already knows about]]. However, one certain article made by Metrowyn was about the website we all know and [[hate|love]]: 4chan. They had first introduced it by playing [[Captain Obvious]], stating that 4chan is chock full of [[CP]] and other details that [[you]] and the rest of the internet should already know about. The blog then moved on to discussing how [[Justin Bieber]] got the fuck trolled out of him not once, but twice. They first explained that (apparently) thanks to 4chan, "[[truth|Justin Bieber has syphilis]]" is #1 on Google Trends. Following that, they reminded us of a not so long ago poll where Justin Bieber had asked his [[fangirls]] to vote on an internet poll asking where he should go on his next tour. Communist [[Best Korea|North Korea]] made it to #1.
==RAEG Ensues==
/b/tards patrolling [[Google]] caught whiff of Metrowyn's shenanigans and reported to home base. The boards were in an uprise, and Anon had no other choice but to crank up the [[internet hate machine]] and issue a raid on the site and their facebook. An [[elite]] group of [[hackers]] and raiders went to [[all caps|BATTLE STATSHINZ]] and gave the blog (and article itself) a [[DDOS]]. Shortly after, however, it was discovered that Metrowyn won't come down without a fight. They rebooted the site, and it was up again. However, the site was bandwidth raped again and this time, it stayed down.

==Aftermath==
Although the home-site was down, much was still needed to be done. Their Facebook, Metrowyn.com, was bombarded with [[shock images]], NIGGERNIGGERNIGGERNIGGERNI.. comments, and other tools of raid. None the less, 4chan won over Metrowyn and celebrated with CP and [[USI|pats on the back]].
