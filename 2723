[[Image:2089970bnbh.jpg |thumb|right|Seriously, WTF?]]
'''Etsukoajibana''', aka Els van Maaren, is a prime example of an [[atheist]], racist [[wapanese]] fangirl, who knows as much about Japan as a duck knows how to become a hockey star. Despite being Dutch, she listens to Japanese music, bastardizes the Japanese language (like any other typical weaboo) and dreams of being a manga artist. She's mainly known for being one of the biggest art thieves on [http://www.fanart-central.net Fanart Central] and the biggest hypocrite in [http://www.deviantart.com Deviantart]. A close companion of the more popular art thief [[Bean]], Etsuko followed along in the footsteps of many untalented [[weeaboo|fanbrats]] before her. Unable to create the caliber of art required to get her the mindless asspats from the Yu-Gi-Oh fanbase, Etsuko did what every attention starved [[16 year old girl]] does; she edited many screenshots and traced her artwork. And even with proof she still does it, she denies she still traces her pics.

There has also been recent evidence that Etsucko has been taking multiple Yugioh screenshots from all over and tracing them to make one picture. (Example: Yugi's face shape, Tea's eyes, Dark Magician Girl's mouth all traced to make her [[Retard|retarded]] Mary-sue.


==Brief History for New Haters==
Els first appeared on FAC. She claimed that she was in love with Yami Yugi from Yu-Gi-Oh so she created an OC, which is just a self insert slightly altered  DMG. She submitted screenshot traces, traces of other people's artwork, screenshot edits, and her occasional artwork that was actually drawn herself. Of course, since everyone on FAC is an art thief and are stupid fucktards, she quickly gained popularity. At one point, her FAC account was even hacked, but she quickly regained control of it. She soon met Bean and her other fellow art thieves and in which case they made a stupid club named B*KewT. Somewhere along the line the club split up putting an end to their faggotry. Sometime in 2007 she created an account on DeviantArt and submitted her traces there. Eventually she stopped posting art on FAC. She has now deleted everything on her FAC page and Photobucket and now resides on her DA page.

==The Obsession==
'''If you fap to her you are a [[sick fuck]]'''


[[Image:Nomoarbabies.png|thumb|right|<s>Yami</s> Atem and Etsuko, [[DO NOT WANT|makin' babies.]]]]
[[Image:ElsvM2001.jpg|thumb|right| Els in her Harry Potter obsession period, or ninja turtles]]
[[Image:ARRG.PNG|thumb|right|Aito, complete with blond hair, blue eyes, and unrealistic expression of <s>anger</s> [[angst]].]]
===Yu-Gi-Oh===
Like most fantards, Etsucko was not pleased with how the creators of Yu-Gi-Oh were carrying the story along. So she created an '[[mary sue|Original character]]'.

[[Image:Andmymumisbritney.jpg|center|frame]]
{{quote|See? That Etsuko looks like me with character and clothes She does look like me, not 100% but 50% for sure}}

Even someone with cataracts can see that Etslutto couldn't possibly be modeled after her creator. The only things they have in common are blond hair, blue eyes and [[KKK|Aryan white skin]]. It is clear that Etsuko is what Els ''wishes'' she looked like; a bad case of [[unrealistic expectations]].<br/>Like many other Yugioh fangirls, she has an unhealthy obsession with Yami, therefore her Mary Sue and Yami have a relationship that goes back over 9000 years ago in ancient Egypt where they ruled as queen and pharaoh. Yeah... Right. Her OC Etsuko Ajibana is based off of [[hentai|Dark Magician Girl]] and even has her as her [[Lolwut|Ka]]. And, as many Mary-Sues, Etsuko is always surrounded with strawberries and pinky-poo colours, dresses up in "cute" style with at least 100 ribbons, speaks wapaneese and is loved by everyone. [[What|Atem even goes to School because of her, even thought he's over 10000 years old]]! And everytime she draws him either with another girl, he's somehow still in love with her completely original OC.<br/>Of course, after fapping over 10 years for Yu-Gi-Oh, and seeing what GIS-Likes-To did to her OC, she decided to simply copy her ideas of changing Etsuko's haircut. She even changed her background story, thinking it will help to make her OC less Mary-Sue. Etsuko now looks more like Els's [[animu|anime-self]].

{{quote|She'll move to Domino City right after Battle City ended (kinda the timeline of the Pyramid of Light movie). Her first days of school are harsh because she's not good at making friends. She first meets Faith, Koyuki and Arisa (who will become her closests friends). Later on she'll get introduced to Yuugi and his friends and slowly she's taking part in their group as well. Blair is first a bully to Etsuko but later on they'll become friends as well.

I haven't really thought up more than that till now and it's a very short summary.

It's not like Eshe will end up with Atemu. She will die during the battle with Zorc to start with. I also pair him with many girls in my story, after all pharaohs had more women.|Etsuko|on true originality.}}

This makes one start to think; because Atem is a [[Lolwut|pharaoh]], she decided to pair [[Mary sue|Etsuko]] with him so she can be the [[Attention whore|queen bitch of Ancient Egypt]], enslaving everyone and [[fangirl|kill those who tries to take Atemu from her]]. Add to this is that she stole Dark Magician Girl from Mana and have that poor Duel Monster as her slave.

They also have kids as well:
*'''Aito''' - EMO princess and penis cutter, propably because he doesn't own one himself. In love with a sparkly version of Hanako, has a Yami side out of nowhere. Typical wannabe-badass character. Based off of Els's favourite singer Masaaki Endoh.
*'''Lisa''' - Typical slutty character. Has giant boobs. Pretends to be next queen of duel. Female version of Yugi.
*'''Etsumi''' -  Despite being shy, was still drawn naked. Has a GIANT fucking ribbon on her head.
*'''Kanako''' - Probably the neighbor's kid, because out of all characters, she's the only one that doesn't look like Etsuko or <s>Yami Yugi</s> Atem. 

Their "kids" somehow formed a band that was named after so-called destiny-shipping: '''Destiny Dreamers'''. Also, the idea of her children becoming famous singers was stolen from, yet again, another Yugioh OC fan artist! Furthermore, these kids are making tons of money by singing JAM project songs! It looks like she's on a roll, folks!<br/>
Of course, Els herself admits that Etsuko should be in the fandom, and to prove that, she created tons of fanarts of her Mary-Sue in different [[copyright]]ed poses. Her gallery resembles that of an Etsuko Shrine. She only sometimes goes out of her way to draw a crappy chibi fanart for others, and it takes her years to complete any comissions she gets. Frankly, she has at least 100 YGO OCs, who are as stereotypical as her precious Mary-Sue Etsuko. Propably they were created to somehow dilute her holy Etsuko Shrine... It failed:

*'''Kiseki''' - Love child of Kanako and her [[pedophile|teacher]]. Was drawn twice before being completely forgotten because Els was too busy drawing Etsuko.
*'''Masaro''' - Another love child of Kanako and her teacher. Was also only drawn twice before being completely forgotten. Is also gay.
*'''Aiko''' - Love child of Aito and Hanako. Also has been completely forgotten.
*'''Yuu''' - Rape child, brother of Aiko. Completely forgotten.
*'''Saori''' - Pink haired bimbo. Has only been drawn once before being completely forgotten.
*'''Ain''' - Drawn once before being completely forgotten (seriously).

Since Els is too busy drawing her pretty [[mary sue]], she has completely and utterly forgotten about half of the OC's she has created!<br/>Els has also noted in a previous journal entry [[Fail|that she will replace Etsuko's ties with DMG amd replace her with the Silent Magician]]. Most likely a desperate attempt to make her OC less Mary-sue. Her efforts are futile.

It's obvious that Etsucko hates Tea Gardner since Yami Yugi is always with her, but of course Etslutto [[Attention Whore|wants Yami Yugi all to herself]] and likes to [[sex|make babies with him]] [[Slut|all night long]]. So she decided to make a video to show [[Slut|how desperate she is just to be with Yami Yugi]]. Same goes to those who have OCs paired with him; [[Lie|she would say that their OCs are rip-offs of someone from the show]] yet her own OC [[Irony|is just a bastardized Dark Magiciain Girl and is the biggest Mary-sue in existence]].

Adding to this, she has an [[Obsession|unhealthy obsession]] with the Dark Magician Girl (she [[Wapanese|prefers calling her by her original Japanese name]] "Black Magician Girl"). Just don't ask her when comparing DMG to another [[Lolicon|anime girl]] as she would most likely [[Fangirl|choose DMG over the other anime girl]] and would [[Fandom|make negative remarks about the other one]]. Ironically her [[mary sue]] is a blatant rip-off of the Dark Magician Girl, which makes one wonder, does Els [[Self-insert|secretly wish to be the Dark Magician Girl]] so that she can be with Yami Yugi and have [[LOL|sex with him]]?
It would make sense, considering that the only other YamiXFemale pairing she supports is YamiXMana. (A.K.A: The Dark Magician Girl). She even drew Etsuko and DMG making out. And everybody knows that Etsuko is just supposed to be Els. Unfortunately, that pic has been deleted from her Animexx profile.

One couldn't help but notice that some of Etsucko's art has the rays similar to the [[Japan|Rising Sun flag of Japan]]. Being a [[Weaboo|weaboo]], she probably either has [[Stupid|no idea that it is the Asian version of the]] [[Nazi|Swastika flag]] or she ignores what it means like what most Wapanese does. Since she is a racist, it is possible that the latter is the reason as she puts the Rising Sun in some of her [[Plagiarism|"artwork"]] which is insulting to [[Azn|non-Japanese]].

Recently, she posted a poll where her "fans" can choose which of Etslutto's children should be [[banned|deleted]] but she do that for attention. Attention whore right?

==Copying and Tracing==
[[File:Ets.jpg|thumb|right|200px|NOT TRACED JUST COPIED]]
[[File:OriginalnewlookEA.png|thumb|right|200px|ALSO NOT TRACED]]
Etsuko admits that she doesn't trace her artwork, she just copies others; she's a [[Mary-Sue|perfect girl with perfect OCs]].<br/>However, when she got noticed on tracing an image, she immedieately deleted it to keep her image clean, pretending that it is the mean editors who lied.

It would not be fair to forget such [[sarcasm|wonderful artwork]] however. Therefore it has been uploaded to ED for your viewing pleasure. Furthermore, if you pay close attention, you'll notice that a lot of her pictures in her gallery are just edited doll bases.

===How She Traces===
If you have looked at the gallery below, you will find that Els has traced many facial expressions from the show. You may be wondering, how does she do this? Well, it's simple. You see, Els uses this nifty art program called Easy Paint Tool Sai. Sai is just like any other art program except it offers something other art programs do not, a curve tool. This along with the "layer" function makes tracing screenshots so easy a five-year-old could do it. And since she's had experience dolling bases in MS Paint, she's a pro at it. Who knows how many pictures she has traced with this method?

Now, her old method for tracing was the old fashioned way. She simply found a pic of Dark Magician Girl or Anzu and simply traced over it. It's good to know she's improving, right?

===JAM Project===
[[Image:New Life Will Be Born by EtsukoAjibana.jpg|thumb|right|Yami was a [[fat|chubby chaser.]]]]
As if her Yugioh obsession wasn't eye-bleedingly bad enough, she also wets her panties over J-Rock. The band you will hear her orgasm about should you ever read her DA page is JAM Project, namely the lead singer, Endoh Masaaki. [[Copyright|She even based off her and Yugi's bastard son out of him!]]. While any normal human being would consider this "music" absolute trash, Els, along with her boatload of fantarts, eat this shit up like strawberry flavored pocky.

BRILLIANT MASTERPIECE, that brought Els's fantards into unforgettable orgasm!
<br>

==By the Way, Etsuko is always reading this article!!! Hi Etsuko!==
No matter how retarded it is, Els is always the first person to read it. So everytime [[Attention Whore|she's pointed out in her tracing]], she either runs to update her journal or art description in such a manner [[Lie|to prove that she still doesn't trace and is the most original person in the whole world]] or delete the picture and call us a liar.<br/>That, and she's always hiding comments on her profile and art, perhaps being afraid that they could be used against her. Paranoid much?

Also you will see that some comments are "Flagged as Spam". Makes you wonder, is she trying to keep her [[Lie|good]] [[Hipocrite|image]] by making others look as if [[Lolwut|they were the ones that attacks the poor]] [[whore|girl]] [[truth|without any reasons?]]

==Fanbase and Friendship==
Just like most fucktards of DeviantART, she has a huge fanbase. If you draw anything related to her Mary Sue she'll automatically fave it, regardless of how retarded it is. And if you want your lulz from them, try telling the truth about her oh-so-original "Art". They will seriously freak out, and block your ass, claiming 'U IZ FLAMER FUK U'.<br/>
Those friends who joined the evil side of evil, {{deviantart|gis-likes-to|gis-likes-to}}, are automatically NOT her best friends in the whole world. It is not known why this is, but some argue that when her ex-friend {{deviantart|ranpha15|Ranpha15}} started to pay attention to Gis, Els deleted every single picture with fanart for that girl, and edited a pixel base to replace her.<br/>Also, even though Etsuko always says that she likes to ''voice her opinions'', it is downright obvious that the faggot is jealous. On top of that, she is extremely sensitive to when people remind her of her tracing, and gets her friends to back her up.
* {{deviantart|bigbadboo|bigbadboo}} Her lovey dovey boyfriend; Edwardumb (And although she claims he's her boyfriend, the guy says he's not! Hmm... <s>recent activities reveal the Etsuko unwatched him...</s> Never mind, she "watched" him again...)
* {{deviantart|xTakeMySoulx|xTakeMySoulx}} Her 23 year-old NOW PORTUGESE bitch that does her slave work so she wouldn't have to face all the flaming.
* {{deviantart|keeneyeshojo|keeneyeshojo}} XTakeXMyXSoulx's supposedly hate account. This hater is known for mean comments and she say for us not to be mean. Hypocrite!

'''OH WAIT!''' Turns out that keeneyeshojo was Els all along!  XTakeXMyXSoulX could be her too...

* NinjaTurtles12: Another account Els hid behind to flame others, pretending to be a [[WTF|male from Japan.]]
This bashing account Els made is famous for bashing another user who had a YamiXOC pairing. More on this in the "Interaction with other Fangirls" section.

So we can see that Els has [[Over 9000|over 9000]] DeviantART accounts, just so she can [[Not|secretly]] bash the people she hates; using those accounts so she doesn't ruin her [[lolwut|"perfectly innocent image"]] she has with her main account.

So the next time one will post an OC paired with Yami Yugi, be careful as [[Bitch|Etsuko]] will likely [[Attention Whore|make a journal how Sueish that OC is]] and she will spread [[Lulz|what she feels to her]] "close friends", if she has any [[Insane|and poison their minds]].

<s>There is also a possibility that [[bitch|Etsucko]] is [[attention whore|celebrating]] when a Yami fangirl "disappears" (like deactivates their account in Deviantart), thinking that [[Fail|she have won]].</s> Never mind. That fangirl came back!

Another thing Els loves to do is slander people behind their backs.
Being the [[attention whore]] she is, if one of her friends is friends with another Yami fangirl or someone she just hates, she will message that friend and tell them how much she hates that person. It is also possible that she spreads lies about that person as well. It's assumed she does this because she hopes that, that friend will leave the person she hates, so they will focus and love Etslutto more.
In short: Els has the worst and most bitchy and shittiest attitude of all time.

==Interaction with Other Fangirls==
Els hates other Yami fangirls. Even if she pretends to be their friends, one can only assume that it's because she's jealous of them and their talents, and the fact that they don't have to copy and/or trace other people's artwork. Or perhaps it's because [[Self-insert|she's jealous of them because she wants Yami all to herself and wants people to worship only her pairing]]?<br/>

[[Image: Lolwutfail.JPG|center|frame|She's not afraid to express her hatred towards other Yami fangirls.]]

[[Image: Ownedhaha.jpg|center|frame|How she failed and still fails.]]

[[Image: Loletsuckoowned.JPG|center|frame|This is what most of her comments on her page are like before she hides them or flags them as spam.]]

And the funny thing is, is that if you look through her comments, they're all either hidden or flagged as spam. 
She's [[Lie|innocent]], eh?

It was also recently discovered that Els had hacked into another Yami fan's, who also had an OCXYami pairing, account.
Els tried to justify her actions by saying that she was only trying to do the [[Lie|right thing]] and delete the user's traced pictures.
First off, [[Art theft|Els isn't one to talk, now is she?]]
She later then tries to apologize on the girl's journal, obviously trying to clear up her already horrible image.
Since she is known for being a liar, how can we trust her? We don't. [[FAIL|Nice try, Els.]] You were never a perfect angel in the first place.

[[Image: Nuffsaid.png|center|frame|Nuff said.]]

Her flaming account: NinjaTurtles12. She used this account to flame and bash another Yami fangirl who had a YamiXOC pairing.
One of the reasons why she did that is because the user traced art. [[Art thief|But Els isn't one to talk, is she?]]
Fortunately, [[WIN|the user stopped tracing,]] [[Retard|unlike a certain Etslutto.]]
Another obvious reason, is because the user had a YamiXOC pairing. And we all know how much Els hates other Yami fangirls.
But in this account, we also get to see Els's true colors. She used this account to make hate fanart, aimed towards the Yami fan she called out for tracing. It included her bashing the girl personally, by making fun of the girl's poor grammar and spelling. While it's true that the girl truly did have horrible spelling and grammar, Els's actions were very immature and uncalled for. If you read the comments she posts, talking to other users who commented on the pictures, we can see her insulting the girl personally, saying "she has no brains" and such.
Els is nice? Yeah right.
Here are the links to the pictures that make fun of the girl's grammar and spelling. Make sure you read all the user comments! In one of them, Els even shows up in her main account, EtsukoAjibana, to try and make it look less suspicious. It failed:

(Oh hey! [[FAIL|This is supposed to be the 5th picture! Why is the Roman Numeral for 6 on here?]] Fail, Els. Ultimate Fail.)

Another famous picture she did to bash the girl was creating a picture of the girl's OC killing herself.
How mature Els. You're 20 years old right now. I hope you know how irreversibly crappy you've made yourself look over the years.
Want to cure it? Here's the only solution. Stop drawing and GTFO the internet. Forever, kthxbai.

As much as possible, do not get associated with her, she will screw your thinking and forcing you to help her in [[Nazi|enforcing her own brand]] [[Lulz|of "justice"]].

==Other Notable Mary Sues That Nobody Cares About==
[[Image:SLICEETSUKO.PNG|thumb|right|Everytime she draws her Mary-Sue, Sylar gets angry]]

===Etsuko Yamamoto===
Her Naruto Mary Sue that she paired up with Kabuto Yakushi.
*Eye color: Blue
*Hair color: Blond
*Age: 18
*Personality: Strongheaded, Kind, [[lolwut|Peachful]], Sensitive, Caring, Arrogant(a bit), Shy(only when she's around a boy that she loves), Quick tempered when people make fun of her or when they are annoying her, she uses the power of the nature in her fights and uses her katana. Sometimes she uses shurikens. She fled a battle by disappearing in a sakura leaf storm, a whirlwind or by using a smoke ball.
*Personal Quote: "Once you live as a ninja, you can't live an other way"; "A ninja always stays and lives in the shadows"
*Crush: Kabuto Yakushi

{{quote|"♥ I don't give a damn that her outfit looks like Kasumi's! I just like that female ninja outfit! And I gave her the power of nature, because I love nature myself ♥"}}

===Hiromi===
Her [[Pokémon]] OC, who appears to be copied from another character. Likely created due to Els being a 24/7 Pokémon gamer. Her team consists of a Dratini, [[redundant|Dragonair]], Swablu, Trapinch, and Gible. [[shit nobody cares about|She loves to train in Dragon's Den in the Johto Region, and dislikes Dragon Tamers who use 'dragon look-a-likes' like Aerodactyl, Charizard, Gyarados, etc. She believes that if you're a real Dragon Tamer, you only use pure dragon types (which is technically impossible since there are no '''pure''' dragon types). Lance will eventually challenge her to show her that the so called 'look-a-likes' are powerful and he will defeat her again and again, irritating Hiromi]].<br/>
She's interested in stories about the legendary dragons like Rayquaza, Latios, Latias, Dialga, Palkia and Giratina. [[Liar|She loves to investigate those stories, eventhough she never saw one of those legendary dragons.]]

==Own Manga In The Works==
Now that she honestly thinks she has enough [[Art theft|talent]], she's started [[DO NOT WANT|her own manga]]. Her manga was originally called [[Weaboo|FATE]], but was then changed to The Red String of FATE.<br/>She's apperently so excited about it [[Fantard|she won't stop talking about it in her journal]], but can't seem to start it for years. She eventually spoiled the whole plot before the manga was even started: Ryo cheats on Emiko a million times; Emiko locks herself in toilet and runs away from class; Ryo hooks up with Sayaka; Emiko is left all alone and cuts herself; in the end Ryo decided that he loves Emiko; THE END.<br/>
It is expected that her manga will contain more of her completely "original" characters:
*'''Emiko Fukui''': brown haired version of Etsuko with glasses, who wears the same outfits Els wear.<br> 
*'''Ryo Henry Yates''': bad ass type  boy. Half English, Half japaneese. Often chased by girls and cheats on Emiko like 1000 times.<br>
*'''Sayaka Naname''': Typical friend, and propably absolutely unneeded character.<br>

Els, of course, is still announcining manga and can't start it, since she plays Pokémon and her head is full of changing Etsuko again, or it could be because the other YGO fan artist who Els stole the original manga idea from took down all her work and manga pages so Els couldn't copy/steal from her anymore. Therefore, she can't start her manga because the manga she was going to copy was taken down. Also, because all of those little tartlets are still oblivious to the fact that she "used" to trace, they still [[Sex|love]] her [[Tracing|artwork]], propmpting her to put "Your words keep touching me." in her signature.

== WIN ==
'''ELS STOPPED COPYRIGHTING POSES! And not only that, she also gave copyrights to someone!''' 
Yes, It is unbelievable, but see for yourselves:
[[Image: Whutlol.jpg]]
<br>
<br>
Yes, she didn't gave a copyright to a pose. Who knows, maybe one day she'll do something different, so stay tuned on Encyclopedia Dramatica!

[[Image: Etsluttocredits.png]]

Even though calling tracing "referencing" is still tracing. Referencing ≠ tracing.

== TL;DR ==

Els is a racist [[Attention Whore|attention whore]] and  an [[Plagiarism|art-thief]] with an [[Slut|OC]] [[Weaboo|named]] [[Mary-sue|Etsuko]] who hates other fangirls that loves Yami Yugi and cuts herself. The world will be at peace if she becomes [[an hero|an hero and disappears from existence]].

==How to Troll==

- Call her NinjaTurtles12 or KeenEyeShojo<br>
- Ask her which anime girl is better comparing to the Dark Magician Girl. <br>
- Tell her that another anime girl is better than Dark Magician Girl.<br>
- Tell her that Anzu+Atem or another OC+Atem couple is better than Etsuko+Atem<br>
- Remind her that the name, DestinyShipping, is already taken for Sartorius+Aster<br>
- Never forget what she had done to Ami-Loves-Friends; don't let her forget either =)<br>
- Tell her to stop drawing <br>
