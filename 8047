'''''Team Fortress 2''''' (a.k.a. Trade Fortress 2) is a class-based [[FPS|first-person]] hat collection simulator for the [[win|PC]] and [[fail|Mac]]. Instead of the faithful recreation of the original Quake and Half-Life mods, the game has evolved from its original design into a pointless virtual [[Pokemon|collect-a-thon]] where the player must collect every rare item they can in order to inflate their ego and show off their [[E-peen]]. The original point of the game revolved around playing gamemodes, such as capturing the enemy's [[porn|intelligence]], or controlling a whole map by Scout-rushing control points, although now all this became nothing more than a small mini-game to pass the time with while you wait for more hats to magically drop into your inventory.

{{clear}}

===Non-Playable Characters===
As TF2 progressed down it's path to becoming complete [[shit]], a number of non-playable characters appeared. Really, [[truth|Valve doesn't give a shit about any of them]] except for [[ITG|Saxton Hale]], who is basically an [[Australia|Australian]] version of [[Chuck Norris]] who is [[not|slightly]] less [[unfunny]] but far more [[forced meme|forced]]. One noteworthy [[fact]] about Saxton is that his name is an anagram for '''[[gay|"hot anal sex"]]'''. The only other character even worth mentioning is The Announcer/Administrator, who is a bitchy chain-smoking hag that sits in a chair and yells about how much you suck at the game.
{{clear}}

==Spy [[Crabs]]==
[[Image:Spycrabmating.jpg|thumb|left|Crab on crab action.]]
Shortly after the game's release it was discovered that holding out your Disguise Kit, looking straight up, crouching, and then moving around resulted in the Spy walking in a wonky manner not unlike a [[Giant enemy crab|crab]]. This became a meme among TF2 players. It's not uncommon to see a couple of Spies crabbing around for entire matches while onlookers point fingers and/or guns at them. Many a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dyQlZziHnw YouTube video] documenting their shenanigans has been posted.

The phenomenon has also spawned a "Save the Endangered Spy Crabs" campaign, perhaps to counter the tendency for players who decide to kill Spy Crabs, or to parody the various campaigns employed by [[PETA|ecoterrorists]] to prevent the gathering of vital natural resources. Whatever the case, often [[Germans|medics]] participating in the campaign will [[waste|use]] their ubers on the Spy Crabs to keep them alive as long as possible.

In an update, the Spy gained another taunt for the kit that puts the spy in the spy crab pose and he'll click his kit open and closed like a [[Retard|crab]].
{{clear}}

==[[watersports|Jarate]]==

Some time ago a weapon called "Jarate" was added to the Sniper's arsenal. Jarate is basically a jar full of Australian [[piss]]. It supposedly started out as an [[April Fools']] joke, until Valve decided to make it an official unlockable for the Sniper. The TF2 forums were immediately filled with [[over 9000]] threads crying about Jarate being gross and immature, and demanding the rolling back of the item through a [http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=867272 petition]. Their petition failed and nothing of value was lost.

<center>{{frame|{{morphquote|jarate|background-color: #FEFFCF; width: 800px; height: 200px|font-weight: bold;

I love sniper, and if you're going to give him a jar of piss to defend from spies then you just ruined him. He already has the shield to defend from spies, and I don't understand why he would need two anti spy weapons.

YOU. OFFICIALLY. SUCK.

THIS CRAP IS NOT FUNNY.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

YOU PUT A JAR OF FREAKING PISS IN THE CLASSIEST GAME EVER|NanoSquid, unleashing the [[ALL CAPS|motherfucking rage]]
|I WILL NEVER FORGIVE VALVE FOR THIS

EVER|NanoSquid, who never forgives and never forgets
|I WANTED to thank Valve. Everything in this update was downright awesome.
...until Jarate. That concept is filled with more [[fail]] than the combined [[win]] of every other part of this update. Ruined the entire thing for me.

Fortress Forever? Yesplz.|Ambersand
|Not because a jar of urine is [[Goatse|disgusting]] (which it is ofcourse), but because its [[lie|uninspired]], stupid, etc. I mean [[WTF|what the hell]] Valve? You can think up all these great things, but for the sniper inspiration runs out and you can't even consider a boomerang (since he's australian) over Jarate?

You are babies, people with the mind of 5 - who still laugh about pee, poo, etc.|Airpressure
|Fail petition thread is fail! CRY SOME MOAR!

/pisses in your mouth|slingblade123, resident urophiliac
|This is disgusting, and an [[Shocked_and_Appalled|embarrassment]] to tf2 and the community. Somehow you all think throwing jars of pee is mature? [[Your|You're]] immaturity is telling. It's not funny unless you're in fifth grade or a monkey. I'd be embarrassed to have anyone I know seeing me play a game with a jar of pee as a weapon. It's stupid, juvenile, and [[Your mom|immature]], and anyone who doesn't see that is [[NO U|one of those three things]], or so insecure that they want others to think they are one of those three things. I certainly hope valve removes this from the game- or this will be the first update that I am not anxiously waiting to play come Thursday. Valve really really sucked the life out of the update with this unlock.
/signed|Mitthrawn, because TF2 is serious business
|Its just stupid and they could have done way way better. All it makes me think is.........So the target audience is [[13 year-old boy|12]]? Then you got the idiots that defend it. Grow up and have a sense of humor....is [[Their|there]] come back. Its not what it is, its that it could have been something more fitting then just some lame joke.

/quits moves onto something else.|Hektik133, who believes someone actually gives a shit}}|color=#FDFF27}}</center>

==Viral Faggotry==
Valve decided to make different videos of classes comparing cock sizes. They decided to name them the "Meet the Team" videos.  Every video is a documentary of a different class and their particular quirks. Only 7 out of the 9 classes have their own videos. One of them is about a fucking sandwich.

==Bonk Songs==
Another popular fad on the internets is to make covers of well-known songs using nothing but the scout's "Bonk!" and "Boink!" sound effects, in a manner not unlike the utilization of [[PINGAS]].  The original Bonk Song (seen below) was of that theme that plays during [[Football|NFL]] games. The Bonk Song, as well as some other unfunny TF2 shit, became extremely popular on [[YouTube]], and soon many other versions were made.

== September 2, 2009: The Halocaust ==
[[Image:Halo tears.jpg|thumb|At the time, you couldn't go 1 minute on [[/v/]] without seeing this.]]
[[Image:FreeTF2updates.png|thumb|left|[[Nerd|SPUF]]'s reaction to free updates]]
If TF2 wasn't gay enough, Valve announced that they would release items that could be found during play.  These items would be given to players at random, meaning they were independent of the achievements.  After much masturbating by the TF2 community, many were pissed that they couldn't get the new unlocks and cried whenever they saw a player with the new item.  It didn't take long before many of the [[13_year_old_boy|spoiled players]] decided to find a way to get the items.  This resulted in players idling in servers, forcing TF2 to become Idle RPG.

Doing absolutely nothing in order to get items--which were intended to be given to people actually ''playing'' the goddamn game--was hard work, so they all decided to '''download a program that idles for them'''. Valve caught wind of the massive faggotry and went into an eRAGE. So what did they do? Fuck 'em in the ass is what they did. Valve [[Delete fucking everything|removed all of the items that were obtained through idling]]. To nobody's surprise, the forums [[cum|erupted]] in a [[Rage|fury]] that wouldn't be forgotten until the next update.

This act split the community in two, between those who didn't cheat and got a free [[Halo|halo]], and the whining faggots that got [[BDSM|punished]] for cheating. As a result, some servers started banning all halo-wearers, some banned non-Halo wearers, an entire group of medics was made to deny halo wearers health, and people reskinned the Halos to say "FAG". The Halocaust finally ended when everyone realized how [[fugly]] the hat actually was and the people that had Halos stopped wearing them. Idling continued and nobody learned a thing. [[retarded|Not even Valve]].
{{clear}}



== June 10, 2010: The Mac Update ==
[[Image:Butthurt_anti-mac_fags.jpg|thumb|left|75px|Typical butthurt Anti-[[Steve Jobs|Mac]] fags.]]
On June 10, 2010, TF2 was officially released for Mac OS X to the ire of [[13_year_old_boy|Mac haters]] everywhere. Along with the update, in-game white Apple-style earbuds were made available for people who logged into the game on a Mac. Like the Halocaust, this caused an [[Rage|eRage]] among many a  butthurt faggot, many the same who were the same butthurt faggots who were denied a Cheater's Lament and lost all their items they obtained through [[Faggotry|Idling]]. One faggot even started a [http://steamcommunity.com/groups/fuckmacs petition] that ended up in [[Fail|FAIL]] after it was pointed out to him that most people wearing the earbuds were PC users who had logged in via a Mac to get the earbuds and that most Macfags don't game anyway. Again, it was another instance of a whole shitstorm over FUCKING PIXELS.

In the end, earbuds were actually useful because [[WIN|they acted as free-kill markers]].

== September 30, 2010: The [[Bailout Plan|Mann-Conomy]] Update ==
[[Image:Unusual_Hat.png|thumb|Flaming hats? Shut up and take my money.]]

=== [[Sex|Trading]] and [[capitalism|Store]] ===
Crafting aside, Valve decided to release another great update to the game, enabling players to trade their [[AIDS|weapons]] with each other. As you would expect, thousands of idlers and players came out to trade their weapons. But while doing so [[fail|fucked up]] the [[Steam|$team]] Cloud which resulted in [[win|rage, due to the loss of their precious metal and weapons.]] Not to mention idling is now broke to due the cap of finding weapons.

If '''that''' wasn't enough, the [[Electronic Arts|Elders of Zion]] sent Valve a memo stating that they weren't giving them enough [[Jew gold]] by making free updates, so they enabled players to [[WTF|pay for virtual items]] that are [[fail|more expensive than the game itself]]. This '''of course''', led to another heaping bowl of babby rage.
<br>

=== Hat-related [[Faggotry]] ===
As if [[advertising|promotional items]] didn't cause enough hat elitism, Valve added a new type of [[gay|"Unusual"]] hat, which allows its wearer to run around with a flaming [[dong]] covered in peace signs hovering over his head. Unusual hats can only be acquired through crates or trading. In order to open a crate you need to buy a one-time use key, keep in mind there is a 1% chance of getting an Unusal hat from a crate. [[fail|All that so your head becomes a bright obnoxious target for Snipers to see across the map.]]


...[[sarcasm|And because one kind of new super rare item just wasn't enough fun]], they also gave all the items that existed before the Mannconomy update [[oldfag|"vintage"]] status. What this means is that your old hats are still just as useless and ugly as they were before, but now they have [[recolor|blue text instead of yellow!]] Many hat collectors (aka what remained of TF2's playerbase) put a great deal of effort into collecting vintage hats, believing that in time they will become increasingly rare as people craft and delete them. Any sane person would realize that nobody is going to delete an item that could get them [[at least 100]] hats through trading, but anyone who had any trace of sanity stopped playing this game a long time ago.

==December 17, 2010: [[Australia|Ausfailian]] Christmas==
=== Merry fucking Christmas, Buy our hats ===
Apparently, Valve decided that they wanted [[moar]] money for [[Christmas]], and the TF2 community was going to be their [[Santa Claus]]. As Christmas day drew near, a number a special updates and events were held that would exploit people's desire for hats at a level never seen before. First they started the [[Steam]] [[Jew Gold|Treasure]] Hunt, where players were awarded exclusive hats for buying expensive games they don't want. As it turns out, the first two hats were [[pirate]] hats with a treasure chest on top, and the 3rd hat, which required the player to own all of the games in the treasure hunt, was the same treasure chest getting eaten by an [[paul|octopus]]. They also offered ''yet another'' promotional item to the people who bought [[Zerg Rush|Killing Floor]], a game which half of TF2's community hadn't even heard of, let alone wanted, which was currently having it's own (much less expensive) Christmas event, [[I accidentally X|inadvertently]] revealing that [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqVvmXD6G6I&feature=player_embedded the Pyro is a male britfag] in the process. But the worst was yet wost was yet to come. Because who really PAYS for their presents?

===The Christmas Update===
Players knew that something Christmas-related was coming, as they were receiving mysterious "festive crates" from drops, which had all sorts of holiday shit piled on it. [[unrealistic expectations|Many hoped that these crates would be opened up for free on Christmas day]], and stuffed their backpacks with them. What they got instead was [[capitalism|Australian Christmas]], a holiday where instead of giving you presents, Santa [[pedophile|enslaves your children]] and bleeds you dry. Valve added [[at least 100]] new items which Valve spent [[less than three]] minutes working on, made evident by the lazy animations and horribly imbalanced stats. As it turned out the festive crates [[what|costed just as money to open as regular crates]], and were ultimately a waste of time in every way imaginable as [[facepalm|Valve planned to make the items inside them drop later on]]. The new weapons needed an entire scrapyard's worth of metal to craft now, because Valve would rather you bought these gameplay-affecting items than got them for free. There was also a new gamemode, where you are forced to use old fashioned weapons and talk like a [[retard]].

The moneyfaggery reached an all-time high when it was discovered the official map, Steel, was found broken. [[Shit_no_one_cares_about|While it was common for TF2 updates to break community maps,]] this was the first time that an officially supported map wouldn't work. And the root cause? The engine itself couldn't precache all the models necessary to render the map when all that memory was being filled up with useless hats and community weapons. The bug was fixed after a week, but [[facepalm|Valve blamed the problem on the map rather than their own greediness]]

Listen, you retarded dipshits, nobody wants to see more of your nerdy pwning/youtubePoop videos.
If it isn't lulz, don't add it! If you're doubtful if it is or isn't lulz, DO NOT ADD IT!
If you think it's lulz and you have more than one person here on ED calling you a fucking moron, DO NOT ADD IT!


Also, no Scout "bonk" songs. Those go up in the "bonk" songs page.
Same with the advertisements introducing characters.
