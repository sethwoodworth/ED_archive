A ''science pirate'' is someone who breaks the laws of physics and tries to become a [[rape]] and pillager, while trying to cure The [[AIDS]] and  [[cancer]] at the same time (Basically, while [[bestiality|fucking]] a bitch from behind, he injects the cure for AIDS, because he spreads it like the mother fucking Plague).  #ED finally heard of this God-like class on January 25, 2007 when a man named Demethos walked into #ED, demanding that Science and Pirates be changed, because he was a Scientist and a Pirate.  [[Lulz]] ensued when others chimed in, finding out about their all mighty skills in life, such as being able to wield the very Anti-Irish Potato Cannon they can make themselves (poor fucking potatoes).  The casual dress of the Science Pirate is unknown as of yet, because it's hard to imagine a pirate wearing a lab coat with half of a goggle on him with that side pained all black...wait...THAT'S WHAT THEY DO WEAR!
