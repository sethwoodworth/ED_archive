{{quote|To be honest I think everyone's overreacting a bit. I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's just a cat.|[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1305751/Cat-bin-woman-Mary-Bale-Whats-fuss-Its-just-cat.html Mary Bale, about to get raped]}}

One morning in August 2010, Darryl Mann of Coventry, England left his house and heard mewing coming from inside the family wheelie-bin. It was their cat Lola, who had evidently spent the night there having fallen in and becoming trapped.

Now, it just so happened that the Mann family had a CCTV camera set up in their front garden to discourage the [[niggers|colourful inhabitants]] of the area, so it made sense to look at the tapes to find out how Lola had managed to get trapped in the first place.

What they saw [[WTF]]ed the shit out of just about everybody.

Before their partly-horrified, partly-bemused eyes, a genuinely surreal scene unfolded. The elderly lardbeast seen above approaches Bincat, greets her, looks to the bin, looks to the cat, looks around to check that nobody's watching then finally scruffs the cat, drops it in the bin and walks on with a stride that seems to suggest [[Idiftl|"Right, that's that sorted then."]]

{{quote|If you know the woman, get in touch with like the police. Actually not the police, probably the RSPCA. Yeah them.|Bincat's eloquent owners}}

From there, the passage of information goes like this:

# The owners upload the footage to [[Failbook]] and [[Youtube]] with the hope of identifying the attacker.
# The video goes viral, and is picked up by the [[old media]].
# The story hits national news and filters back to the internet and into social media sites via [[NORP]]s.
# The drama bomb goes off.

==Yee-Haw! We Gon' Have Us A Facebook Lynchin'!==

The attack took place on the 21st of August on [[Caturday]] at about 8PM. By the 25th, Facebook groups such as "I DISLIKE THE AWFUL WOMAN WHO PUT A CAT IN THE BIN" and "The woman who put a cat in the bin should be locked in a bin" had generated around five thousand, and police moved in to put the perpetrator - one '''Mary "Hambeast" Bale''' - under popo protection. 

[[Daily fail|The Mail]] ran the story. 24 hours later the number of Facefuckers following the story had increased to 18,000 and the death threats and lulz were flowing like a river in spring.

==She did it for the lulz==
[[File:Trashcat.jpg|thumb|Pic related]]
Everything however went for the better when she admitted [[lulz]] were her real and only motivation, earning them the title of honorary [[Btard|/b/tard]]:
{{quote|I don't know what came over me, but [[I did it for the lulz|I suddenly thought it would be funny]]. [[Lie|I never thought it would be trapped]]. I expected it to [[Die|wriggle out of the bin]].|Mary Bale}}
 
==[[Troll's Remorse]]==

After getting outed by Anonymous and non-stop death threats, the [[hambeast]] finally issued an [[sorry|apology]] of sorts. 

{{quote|[[troll's remorse|I want to take this opportunity to apologise profusely for the upset and distress that my actions have caused. I cannot explain why I did this, it is completely out of character and I certainly did not intend to cause any distress to Lola or her owners. It was a split second of misjudgement that has got completely out of control.]]|Bale}}


This was followed by swift vengeance:

==Update 20 Sep 2010 - Lard Ass Cunt Face to be hauled before Court on 19 October 2010==

Mary has been charged by the [[PETA|RSPCA]] with two counts of animal cruelty. Quote "Mary Bale, of St Michael's Road, has been charged with causing unnecessary suffering to a cat and of not providing the animal with a suitable environment". 

[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1313657/Mary-Bale-charged-animal-cruelty-dumping-cat-wheelie-bin.html The psychopathic cunt will appear before Coventry Magistrates Court] on October 19. Due to Britain's extremely soft legal system, it's unlikely she will actually be punished. Rather than being locked in a wheelie bin in her own faeces and urine, she will probably be given a suspended sentence, basically a light slap on the wrist. 

== THE RESULTS ARE IN ==
Mary bale has been fined £250 for acts of animal cruelty after [[Troll's Remorse|pleading guilty]].

in adiition she was ordered to pay costs of £1,171 and banned from keeping or [[pwnd|owning]] animals for the next five years.

Many people are RAGGGGING aginst the desision not to kill that piece of shit.

==Serial killers Linked To Cat Torture!==

[[Some argue]] that future serial killers usually torture animals before moving onto [[Man|the bigger game]]. The bizarre nonchalance with which Miss Bale handles the animal seems to tell the story of a definite [[Patrick Bateman]] in the making.

According to a psychologist of Middlesex University, Bale's behavior is cause for concern. "People who are cruel to animals usually feel a [[losers|lack of power in their own lives]]...they may feel helpless, lack authority and want to [[pwn|exercise control]] over something or someone who cannot retaliate. After experimenting with animal cruelty they can go on to target other vulnerable groups, like children or the elderly. If you look at the history of many [[Dexter|serious criminals]] they often started by cutting the whiskers or tails off cats."

{{quote|Ok all you losers who are crying about this stupid cat or saying death to the stupid woman etc... need to really get a life and some perspective. First it was just a cat, that doesn't make it acceptable but at the same time pets belong indoors where their owners can provide for them, keep them safe, and most importantly clean up after them, I personally couldn't give a sh^t about someones stupid pet left alone on city streets regardless of breed or class of animal. Animals **** in the street or yard of decent people who then have to clean up the mess or worse step in it. Feces spread disease also, so if you want to have a pet keep it in your house or tied up in your yard where I don't have to encounter it, or anything it left behind. Was the woman wrong for what she did? - Yes Was it excusable? - No Did she cause harm to a single person? - No Do animals have the same rights as humans? - No they don't. Does the woman deserve the level of villainous comments given to her? [[Yes|No]]. {{chanban}}.|[[User:Naruto Uzumaki|Naruto Uzumaki]] clearly hates pussy.}}
