'''Onideus Mad Hatter''' ([[Powerword]]: Matthew Moulton, aka ''Sad Fatter'', ''Moultard'', ''Farfoos'', ''Baby Matthew'', ''Baby Julie'' and ED socks [[User:Triskaidekaphobia|Triskaidekaphobia]], [[User:Flippant|Flippant]] and [[User:Mipsus|Mipsus]], all of which have been [[b&]] at the IP level at some point for overusing this: [[Otaku emoticons|^__^]] emoticon) is the Internet equivalent of a Renaissance Man, i.e. a [[fat]] [[fuck]]ing failure. His main claims to fame are his [[Sarah Palin|unparalleled, relentless lies]] about his accomplishments, and a pathetic and desperate amount of posting in certain forums. In a [[Portal of Evil]] forum dedicated to making fun of him, he made over [[basement dweller|a thousand posts a month]] for six consecutive months until he was finally [[banned]]. To date, he has made almost '''45,000''' inane posts on a single Usenet group, alt.2600. His time is clearly valuable, so these weren't one-liners, but massive [[butthurt]] textwalls filled with shit grammar and [[emoticon]] abuse on par with that of a [[13 year old girl]]. But Fatter's rabbit-hole of [[failure]] goes deeper...much deeper.

{{quote|Two, out of all the volatile froups PoE is the *ONLY* one that knows I'm actively posting here (notice how there isn't any information about my presence over on ED?)|Onideus Mad Hatter, wrong yet again in the selectbutton forums}}


==Background==
The egregious Moultard alternately claims to be a world-class coder, a [[fail|Flash wizard]], a graphic designer, a master troll and all kinds of other ludicrous assertions. In the cold, cruel world of reality, he's a friendless 29-year old [[babyfur]] and [[faggot|Carebears fan]] who worked the night shift (in diapers) at Dairy Queen (where he [[lie|claimed to be the manager]]) before being dismissed in 2007, whereupon he went to work at [[Walmart]]. Moulton loves to call himself an '''Inventory Control Specialist''', but the world knows him as a '''shelf-stocker'''. He gets quite upset when he is forced by [[The Man]] to help his inferiors in the pallet unloading crew.

He recently bragged about his [[Walmart]] salary, claiming, "I make over $100 a day"; this seems to be quite the pay cut from his previous job, as he claimed to make $60/hr (about $125,000/yr) at Dairy Queen, making him the highest-paid fry cook in DQ history. It should surprise no one, therefore, that [http://friends.portalofevil.com/sp.php?pi=1000540403 he owns a $4,000 hat].  His reputation for honesty and objectivity leaves little room for doubt of any of these claims.

The Hatter likes to spend his spare time being a [[cunt]] on the Internet, filling his diaper and pretending to run a half-assed "web design" business called "Backwater Productions" despite knowing less about web design than a 12-year old AOL user with [[Downs]]. He loudly insists that he is a master [[troll]], and when Portal of Evil discovered that he was a member of multiple [[adult baby]] communities, he came up with the risible claim that his '''ten years''' as a member of these Usenet groups was all a "setup" to a massive future trolling event. [[X Y is X|Obvious lie is obvious]], you [[sick fuck]].

He wears blue-tinted sunglasses because he believes they will help him lose weight because he is a fucking moron.[http://www.diet-blog.com/archives/2008/04/01/weight_loss_sunglasses.php][http://www.gearfuse.com/weight-loss-glasses-make-food-look-unappealing/]

===Fantasy life===
Baby Matt's many delusional fantasies of his own achievements include the supposed creation of a new video codec that he calls ''Interpixel Cascade Fusion'' (never actually completed or even demoed, ever); the world-shaking discovery of ''alpha-transparent video'' (which the real world discovered circa [[At least 100 years ago|1970]]) and something called a ''perfect liquid website'' which is probably some kind of slang for extremely runny [[adult baby|diaper play]] - no one really knows because he hasn't finished it. He also claims to be one of the greatest Flash designers alive, despite the inconvenient [[fact]] that 99 percent of his purported genius coding is in non-working "under construction" versions (see a pattern developing?). Hatter also loves to make empty threats about how he'll hack various websites that have ignored or mocked or banned him, but to no one's surprise, he [[fail|has never done this]].

He also prides himself on his incessant posting to dusty old [[masturbation|Usenet Groups]] (or "froups" as they're called by the profoundly retarded) as though it's some kind of amazing accomplishment, and all the non-crazy folk didn't abandon Usenet [[at least 100 years ago]]. He is probably devoted to Usenet because he can't be [[banned]] from it, which is why the whole discussion system is a mess of [[trolls]] and spammers that no sane person bothers to visit. His Usenet sig is the longest in history, consisting of [[USI|over 60 lines of Hatter self-quotes]] in [[fail|a pathetic attempt to look k3wl]].

He's the world's most expert programmer (just ask him), but loudly claims to prefer his Wal-Mart job because it is more fulfilling to put boxes on shelves all day for minimum wage. When a senior engineer at [[Microsoft]] questioned his expertise, he submitted as evidence a program he'd written in C++. Unfortunately, he neglected to compile it as a release build, so the debug information was included - and when run under the debugger, it revealed itself to be homework for a beginner C++ class.

The general consensus is that Fatter should stick to his core competencies in the realms of pedophilia and menial labor.

===Assessment===
Many unwary people are mildly irritated when they first experience Hatter's "trolling", not so much for the content but because Hatter spends so much of his valueless free time writing long text walls. However, after beholding a few examples of his dribbling, it soon becomes apparent that he is a genuine [[retard]] with an [[USI|unwarranted sense of importance]], similar to [[Chris-chan]]. Both are [[fat]], spend inordinate amounts of time on the net, are incapable of holding down a professional job and have [[lonely|no friends]]. 
[[Image:Babyjuliejf4.jpg|thumb|GOD LEVEL!]]

==Moultard vs. Portal of Evil==
Hatter started posting at the [[Portal of Evil]] back in late 2003 after some gay fucking [[pedophilia|anime]] site was listed there, and after witnessing the fatty's extreme cuntiness, [[Kthor]] decided to list Moulton's own "website" on the Portal.[http://www.portalofevil.com/single.php?poeurlid=000028623] Fatter soon proceeded to rack up thousands of futile and idiotic posts, most of which were deleted by the admin [[Fat|Chet]] when fatty was banned. He provided much [[lulz]] to the regulars by furiously defending how important his job was as [[poor|a fry cook at Dairy Queen]], asserting that he was the "equivalent" of management because he sometimes manned the store alone during off-hours, and that he did the work of several people at once because he was so incredibly efficient.

Hatter was allowed to creep back in under a new alias in 2005, under which he made another 3,000+ posts full of nonsensical babble and retarded catchphrases. It was, admittedly, morbidly interesting to watch Hatter flail about as he desperately tried to convince himself that he was something other than an overweight, blubbering, [[Basement-dweller|rancid mass of butter]], but all good things must come to an end and his unsightly, grease-soaked ass was finally booted from PoE in late December 2006.

He then returned to his usual haunts on Usenet, where he denounced Chet, PoE, and Kthor in a series of dumb and screechy posts, and suspected everyone of being a "Poetard".[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.2600/browse_frm/thread/216571f7f968997f/db74ce0a7691ccc4?lnk=st&q=onideus&rnum=1&hl=en#db74ce0a7691ccc4]

On July 1st, 2007, Chet's flaky Portal of Evil code suffered a massive failure and let the fat fuck log in again.[http://friends.portalofevil.com/sp.php?pi=1000716152] However, he was soon ejected and again withdrew to Usenet, where he vowed buttery revenge:

{{quote|For fun I might exploit his shit encoded PHP login form and see if I can't phish for some passwords using a couple dictionary files.  Given the level of sheer fucking stupidity that most of the PoEtards exhibit I'd be willing to bet that most of them have pretty simplistic passwords.  It's get REALLY funny if I start posting AS the PoEtards using their own accounts.  LOL'' 
<br>
I figure once I've completely ruined and ripped apart PoE I'll move on to their big brother SA and teach those Webbie fags a thing or six about old school trolls like myself.  `, )|[http://groups.google.co.uk/group/alt.2600/msg/caa9890f01cb5193?hl=en& Sad Fatter, incomparably delusional]}}

Naturally, he failed to actually make good on any of these threats. If talk is cheap, 6,000+ posts on a message board dedicated to making fun of you must be the steepest volume discount of all time.

Hatter is currently posting on PoE as user "Your_Daddy"[http://friends.portalofevil.com/fshow.php?userid=15461] and when not defending practitioners of bestiality, he furiously denies that he's the Fatter, though of course his retarded catchphrases and juvenile spelling are a total giveaway.

===Virginity? Intact!===

Despite being willing to make absurd false claims about all kinds of things, Fatter becomes [http://friends.portalofevil.com/sp.php?pi=1000701605 curiously evasive] when asked about his sex life.

This is the proper response to anything he says, in any context, ever: "You are a 29-year-old virgin who stocks shelves at Walmart."

==A Dark Past Catches Up With Our Hero==
[[image:Bm_website_banner.jpg|center]]

After making such a colossal [[lolcow]] of himself on Portal of Evil, Kthor and the other PoE regulars started to do some digging through the [[Usenet]] groups that Fatter proclaimed were so superior to what he called the "Webbies". The search proved fruitful, to say the least...

==Moultard vs. ED & Wikipedia, with a special guest appearance by The Reaver==
When he discovered this article, Hatter made [[over 9000]] attempts to either [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|delete]] it or transform it into a absurdly complementary article about himself that he had written. After his various [[sock]]s were [[b&]] by ED admins, he created the same article on [[Wikipedia]] and then furiously threatened to [[butthurt|DDOS Wikipedia's servers]] after their mods baleeted it. Of course, this threat was never carried out because he's a flabby, inept coward.

{{tinyquote|This is your last warning. If you remove the page again, I'll unleash the Reaver upon Wikipedia. And yes, my bots do have the ability to circumvent your pathetic image verification.|Onideus Mad Hatter}}

"The Reaver" is a [[spam|spambot]] Hatter claims to have written to inflict his [[Nerd Rage|terrible vengeance]] on a world that has rejected him; he's threatened Wikipedia and ED with it, but of course [[truth|it doesn't exist or he would have actually used it]].

[[Image:The_Reaver.jpg]]

Later, Matthew completely contradicted himself by writing the following in the comments section of the [[New York Times]] troll article: 

{{tinyquote|You see I’m generally not liaked much by n00b level tweenage trolls, the kind that infest areas of the web like Encyclopedia Dramatica or Special ED as I call it. I specifically tormented those types in order to goad them into creating the following: http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Onideus_Mad_Hatter Which I then use as a kind of justification to attack other people.|Onideus Mad Hatter}}

Of course, after "goading us" into creating this article he then [[ED:VIP|blanked it a bunch of times]]. ALL PART OF THE PLAN GUYS. Wait...what?


==Moultard vs. Something Awful==
Like all wannabe trolls, the Moultard joined [[Something Awful]] in a valiant attempt to wreak vengeance upon them after his favorite [[babyfur]] forum was mentioned by SA[http://foxtalestimes.actifforum.com/ftopic2795-0-asc-15.htm] and was, of course, [http://imagesocket.com/view/bannedfromSAe93512.PNG banned by Lowtax] before one could say "GTFO YOU FAT BASTARD". As usual, vengeance was sworn:

{{tinyquote|I don't think they'll make too big a fuss around here...if they do...I'll be more than happy to trash the fuck out of their user forums like I did on PoE when I forced Chet to obliterate entire FORUMS over on PoE News just to try and shut me up. I especially liked the parts when he banned me for the, eight time I believe it was, as he went screaming through the forums about how he was going to sue me for "libeling his business". ^_^}}
[[Image:Moulton_In_Diapers.png|thumb|GOD LEVEL!!]]

==Moultard vs. SASS==
Recently, everyone's favorite Wal-Mart employee went to [[SASS]] and repeated his usual performance, except this time, they let him stick around [[for the lulz]]. SASS systematically tore down every claim Matty ever made, including "hacking" and "destroying" SA and PoE, his perpetual motion machine, and his [[Computer Science III|1337 coding skills]]. One SASShole even took a good look at his GOD-LEVEL coding and tried to make it work, which resulted in the server that Fatter's stupid website was hosted on to [[fail|crash]]. Blubbering with rage, Fat Hatter did what any butthurt [[Deviantart|Tartlet]] would do and dug up the TOS for SASS's provider, threatening to destroy everything. SASS just rolled their collective eyes and kept laughing at him.

Recently, Baby Matt has been getting pissy because SASS hasn't awarded him with the big payoff of a [[b&|ban]], which to his fucked-up logic equates to [[epic fail|win]]. His new tactic is to claim that his hacking threats on SA, PoE, Wikipedia and ED are just a delusion created by the SASS [[circlejerk|hivemind]] followed by accusing members of SASS of leveling death threats at him while namedropping the [[v&|FBI]]. They called Matt out on his bullshit lies, repeatedly requesting him to link to the posts containing said threats. True to form, he quickly made several attempts to dodge the question and change the subject.

Mad Hatter also revealed the true current extent of his education: he's certified to operate an electric pallet jack, an accomplishment that he is inordinately proud of.

Lulz available [http://sass.buttes.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=22923&p=5 here],[http://sass.buttes.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=23604 here],[http://sass.buttes.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=25388 here][http://sass.buttes.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=26226 and here] (all way [[tl;dr]])


After SASS mysteriously disappeared in November 08, Matty [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.alien.vampire.flonk.flonk.flonk/msg/bc7d2addf9126b3f claimed responsibility] for its downfall:
{{tinyquote|LOL...

Hilarity then ensued and the whiney little man-baby took his server and went home, shutting the whole thing down, [[Delete fucking everything|baleeting fucking everything]] and leaving the Internets FOREVERS!!1!''}}

==Baby Julie vs. Selectbutton==
It can only be described as one of those "damnable things" when, in a weird collision of worlds, [http://forums.selectbutton.net/viewtopic.php?t=15393&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=943 Hatter appeared on the forums of gaming site Selectbutton] in a thread about [[Bob's_Game|Bob's Game]].  Although [[Lie|he claimed to have been following the thread for weeks]], his reputation for truthfulness suggests that he followed one or more of the links from Portal of Evil. Hatter quickly took over the thread, because the Internet exists for FatHatMatt to talk about himself.  Things get really weird on [http://forums.selectbutton.net/viewtopic.php?t=15393&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=1517 page 38], when Bob offers to buy him a Something Awful account (not knowing, of course, that Hatter was banned from SA long ago) if he'll go trash ''their'' Bob thread.  

This ED page is dutifully linked, and the Selectbutton inhabitants realize that something strange and fat is in their midst. Baby Matthew snarks that only PoE knows that he's on the Selectbutton forums, and that no one on ED knows about it.  This is disproved within minutes when his post is quoted at the top of this very page.

As the Hatter spam increases in volume and venom, the forumgoers begin to drown him out with multiple autostreaming YouTube music videos, making some of the pages impossible to load.  Hatter goes off in a huff to post on other threads, and is promptly banned by the admins.  Predictably, he retreats to his own blog to cry about the mean people and weep buttery tears.  

He finally discovers that ED knows that he knows that ED doesn't know about him, and uses his 1337 skillz to hack ED by clicking on the "history" button. Fatter goes on a mission to discover who put his quote on this page (in another amazing coincidence, it turns out to be the same humble, witty and tirelessly truth-seeking person that wrote this very paragraph). Some extraordinary [http://onideus.blogspot.com/2009/02/smokey-retard.html Internet detective work] proves that someone with the same username made a single post on PoE only seven years ago, and is therefore, obviously, a PoE regular. He posts about this "victory" on his blog, presumably so he can read it over and over while cackling in lardy glee, because no one else will ever see it.

==Matty vs. Thermodynamics==
Or, ''The Perpetual Moulton Machine''
[[Image:Mad Hatter Diagram.png|thumb|GOD LEVEL!!!!]]
In the fall of 2008, Moulton announced to the mighty intellects of Usenet that he was applying for a patent. Was it for the revolutionary ''Interpixel Cascade Fusion''? Nooooo! Was it the ''perfect liquid website''? Nooooo. It was, in fact, for a "geomagnetric resonence energy generator" ''(sic)'' (see [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.2600/browse_thread/thread/198f27bb2b04f030/ee8054c91446de43 here]). Or, in normal English, a perpetual motion machine.
{{tinyquote|I don't understand why you dribblers are so excited about it though, even if it does work it'll effectively render itself to be non-cost effective simply because it would sky rocket the price of neodymium magnets.  I mean it's not like there's an infinite supply of RARE earth magnets.  The other obvious problem is, what happens when you essentially rip off energy from the planets magnetic field?  On a really large scale, with large devices all over the planet, we could be looking at completely fucking up the rotation of the earth, possibly an offset as high as one day a year.  To put it simply, this is not some design to "get rich quick", it's largely for my own PERSONAL experimentation and use.|Baby Matt, always learned and eloquent}}
Since Hatter is as ignorant as the day is long, he doesn't realize that the US Patent Office no longer awards patents for ridiculous perpetual motion machines without proof that they work (i.e. never), and that him calling his woo-woo device a "perpetual energy drive" is not the cunning ploy he thinks it is.

==Fatter vs. Dramachan==
In November 2008, Fatter [http://www.anonib.com/_dramachan/index.php?t=130&g=3 graced] Dramachan with his presence, and Onideus was suddenly faced with his greatest foe: a bombardment of BEANS. This is probably the best way of dealing with Onideus, and beans are far more interesting than anything that slips past his shit sucking lips. You could feel his rage gathering in retaliation to having a mere vegetable placed upon a pedestal way above him, so watching him acknowledge that the general public places him below a vegetable in a popularity contest is a truly satisfying pastime (especially when he panics and tries to boast about his LOL ORIGINAL Care Bears script and cookie cutter RPG in the making). Sadly, the thread has long since abandoned the beans concept in the face of Oni's massive stupidity and giant walls of text; it is over 28 pages long, and after a month or so of being kept on life support, the thread is finally dead.

==Fatter vs. the furries==
Sometime in 2008, Onideus was banned from FurAffinity, probably for being an obnoxious fat fuck.  Instead of taking the hint, Fatter decided he'd get back at those mean ol' furries by starting [http://www.fur-affinity.org/ a furry art dump site of his own]...one that just happens to have the same name as the site he was banned from. Unfortunately, Fatter seems to have let two facts slip through his mind:

* A couple of popular furry art dump sites exist: deviantArt and FurAffinity.
* It takes a lot more than hatred and "god coder skills" to run an art dump site that's even halfway decent.

He claims that the interface for his counterfeit site will be based fully in Flash and, like his Usenet "froups", it'll be damn near impossible to get banned from the site for anything except [[CP|child porn]]. The Dramachan thread linked above features more of his bragging about how his site is going to eventually replace FurAffinity.

Presently, his FurAffinity knockoff is still in "development"; the site contains nothing but potshots at people on FurAffinity and Dramachan, and as its content hasn't changed and new content hasn't been added for months, it'll likely become another of Baby Matt's many failed, abandoned projects.

==Fatter Uncensored==
Despite going to great pains to build a completely unworkable Flash-driven "blog" on his own website, Baby Matthew has recently created a free Blogger blog called [http://onideus.blogspot.com/ Onideus Uncensored]. It's exactly what you'd expect after reading this page: recycled South Park jokes and anime music videos, punctuated with back-patting for destroying [[Portal of Evil]], an achievement tantamount to raping a dead dog.

This blog has now become Matty's prime outlet for posting his trademark infinite butthurt textwalls (not to be confused with Interpixel Cascade Fusion), which have become gradually longer and less coherent as he ages. Banned from all forums that he's frequented, he's now reposting his messages where nobody will see or read them. Other featured content includes hilarious pictures of his house, love poems to Quaker Chewy Granola Bars (which the mountain of lard considers "healthy") and the usual gibberish.

==Hatter Speak==
The Hatter possesses its own corrupt and degenerate jargon which may cause confusion among those unfortunate enough to encounter one of his posts.
* ''Interpixel Cascade Fusion'' - masturbation
* ''alpha-transparent video'' - masturbation
* ''perfect liquid website'' - masturbation
* ''netter'' - masturbator
* ''froup'' - circlejerk
* ''cl00'' - cock

This naturally lead to a [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.2600/browse_thread/thread/4f641d01ff7c8d60/403b309f6e281078?hl=en&lnk=st&q=%22sakura-con%22+onideus# self-congratulatory series of Usenet posts], as Fatter attempted to spin getting kicked out of a [[con]] into a favorable light. Matt, you have entered a [[epic fail|rarefied pantheon]] occupied by such [[losers|paragons of human achievement]] as [[Tumbles the Stairdragon]]. Nice work.


==Hatter, father of modern rap==

Even though he is not black person, Matthew often attempts to [[rap]]. Naturally, it is [[fail|terrible]].

 watch the screen
 let me take ya on back
 jump to fourteen
 you act obscene
 sniffin benzene
 all dressed up like Halloween
 "hi my name's Jolene"
 a closet teen
 it's all in yer genes
 a jumpin bean
 in the ass crack ravine
 prayin for an AIDS vaccine
 hey, hey, let's keep it clean
 no need to be mean
 that's just how it's seen
 in this scene yer the queen


==Cocktail time!==

Matthew claims his alcoholic beverage of choice to be [[piss|Green Chartreuse]] and/or any type of [[cum|white zinfandel]]. So, he's either a whining [[emo]] fuck or a a closet [[faggot|homosexual]].

The Onideus Mad Hatter:

*2 parts sake
*1 part apple sourpuss 
*1 part butter ripple schnapps

Add butter & brown sugar to taste.
Heat, mix & serve.
Serves one enormously fat man.


==Gallery of COCK SLAP==
Just as Anons make drawings of [[Chris-chan]] and other [[lulzcow]]s, Fatter has inspired his own share of artistic mockery over the years from the [[Portal of Evil|PoEtards]]...
