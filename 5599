My mom just died
Also known as "my grandmother just died" or "my dad just died."
[[image:Wtc_005.jpg|thumb|Another twist to the "My mom just died" story is to say that she died in a well known [[lulz|tragedy]], such as [[WTC]].]]

On teh [[internets]], saying "[[your mom|My mom]] just died" is a classic attempt by the defending user at disrupting the [[lulz]] on any [[troll]]-ridden thread. It is used as a last resort, when the user is trying to garner both sympathy and righteous indignation. Much [[drama]] is often the result of this announcement, usually bringing an array of [[White Knighting|white knights]] to the rescue.

Needless to say, the defending user is usually full of [[shit]]. 

Such an exchange would go something like this:
:John: You're a dumb slut.
:Jane: My mom just died! :( ;(

Surprisingly, the [[catchphrase]] "My mom just died" is prevalent in all forms of the [[internets]], including [[IRC]], [[Livejournal]], even on [[AOL Instant Messenger]].

Little do these users know that, at the end of the day, this only serves to increase the [[lulz]]-o-meter. However, upon reading "my mom just died", weaker trolls will experience [[Troll's Remorse]].
