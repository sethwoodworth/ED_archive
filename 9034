[http://www.wikiality.com/Main_Page '''Wikiality'''] is the [[The Colbert Report|Stephen Colbert]] [[wiki]] on [[Wikia]], dedicated to creating a reality [[leftards|Colbert fanboys]] can all agree on. Most articles are either on gay [[bear]]s or Americone dreams. Colbert's [[LOL]] effect relies on visual and voice delivery, and he doesn't pay his writers enough to touch the place, so Wikiality finishes up being about as funny as receiving a wet fart in the face. 

Though its primary function is [[sarcasm|spreading patriotism]] and [[satire|the "good word"]], its userbase contains high numbers of godless freedom-hating [[indiefucks]]. Whilst marginally less [[fucktard|retarded]] than [[Unfunnypedia]], '''Wikiality''' is for the most part as dull as its editors -the notable exception being their page on the [http://www.wikiality.com/Holocaust Holocaust]. Since Wikiality shares hosting with [[Uncyclopedia]] on [[Wikia]], its extreme [[fail]] is exacerbated by its status as a kind of second-string official parody site for [[Wikipedia]]. 

Wikiality does serve one useful purpose, as a [[site|place of exile]] for [[Miltopia]] and [[User:Zen444|Lolwiki]] when they get [[banhammer|tossed off ED]] by [[Sysop]]s for teh [[Vandal#Encyclopedia_Dramatica_Vandalism|faggotry]].

There was once another Wikiality but it is no longer active due to [[Muslim]] vandalbots posting [[goatse]].

{{quote|Encyclopedia Dramatica is a website with less humor than [[Unfunnypedia|Uncyclopedia]], less truthiness than Wikipedia and more goatse than the rest of the internets combined. "ED", as it's affectionately known amongst its rabid following of anal-leet aficionados, is a wiki built around the premise that the key to good comedy is a lack of jokes, a lot of ass, and a few choice victims upon whom to mercilessly pound. In other words, '''ED is the [[13 year old boy|Nelson Munz]] of the internets.'''|wikiality as of june 10,2007}}

High praise indeed.
