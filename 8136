'''''The Areas of My Expertise''''' is an almanac compiled by [[John Hodgman]] (aka [[PC]] in Apple's ''Mac vs PC'' ads and Hodgman The Hoboverlord), and contains entirely [[true]] information about, Hobos, Werewolves, Lobsters, telling the future, and just about everything besides some stuff.  The Areas of My Expertise has shed light on numerous topics that we're otherwise misconstrued, all fucked up, or completely missing from society. It also disproves common myths, such as Chicago.

The Areas of My Expertise is widely known to be more accurate than [[Wikipedia]]. Though often shortened, primarily in the interest of the deaf, the full title of the book is:

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">An Almanac of Complete World Knowledge Compiled with Instructive Annotation and Arranged in Useful Order by myself, John Hodgman, a Professional Writer, in the Areas of My Expertise, which Include: Matters Historical, Matters Literary, Matters Cryptozoological, Hobo Matters, Food, Drink & Cheese (a Kind of Food), Squirrels & Lobsters & Eels, Haircuts, Utopia, What Will Happen in the Future, and Most Other Subjects</blockquote>

== 700 Hobo Names ==
Included in the book is a comprehensive list of every hobo name included in the book, which there are 700 of.  Including the list here would violate ED's policy against [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Copyrights|Copyright infringement]], which would be [[gay]].  Instead, here is a list of 5 Hobo Names the book left out:
#Joe Billy-o IV, Who Can Rip A Phone Book in Half
#Skank-Blasta Mickey D
#The Street Light
#Jeffery Weezenberg, Who's Wake Consists Primarily of Dead Puppys [sic]
#Tim Allen

== Further Hobo Matters ==
Other than the 700 hobo names, information is included involving Hobo Code, the Hobo King, and much more.  It does not, however, mention the National Hobo Convention, which does not actually involve real hobos, and is [[goatse|gay]].

== Our 51 United States ==
For each of the 51 states, the nickname, motto, and a short description is included.  For instance:<br/>
Kentucky<br/>
Nickname: Land of Sad Grasses<br/>
Motto: Fighting Never Proved Anything, Except Who's Better"
