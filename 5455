Modding
[[File:Moot soup.jpg|thumb|[[Not to be confused with]] an [[Mod|Internet mod]].]] 

'''Modding''' is the process of making [[games]] that you've played over a thousand times interesting again. Although mods are supposed to be the creative, skillful creations of the computer-savvy, they're really constructs of [[nerds]] attempting to [[Roleplay|live out their fantasies]] through video games. Mods generally contain the following:

*[[Sex]] and [[nudity]]
*[[Crossovers]]
*[[Unfunny|No lulz]]

Mods are interactive fanfics. Modders tend to give the player cool, yet unrealistic clothing, armor, weapons or items. New locations and plotlines can be generated, but the locations tend to be fun-houses, and the plotlines cater to those wishing to play as a [[Mary Sue]].

==Furry mods==

[[Furry]] mods make up 50% of all mod requests. Such mods can be used to virtually fulfill a furry's fantasy about being [[Lucario]].

Using [[furry]] mods in video games has several advantages:

#You won't have to spend money on a [[fursuit]].
#You won't have neighbors pointing and laughing at [[you]].
#The Internet and video games don't have much of a good reputation to begin with.
#It's easier to remain anonymous online or in video games.

The only disadvantage of a [[furry]] mod is the [[Virgin|lack of real-life furry sex]], although [[some argue]] that this is a good thing, as then there is no chance of reproduction.

Modders are often responsible for giving video games a bad name. Two of the most notorious modders are [[Eric Harris]] and [[Dylan Klebold]]. These modders modified ''[[Doom]]'', since there wasn't enough [[The Doom Comic|ripping and tearing]]. They were able to edit in students and teachers into the game in order to [[Zerg Rush|shoot them up]]. They even called these mods [[No life|"[their] life's work"]]. It is due to modders like these that [[Jack Thompson]] was able to hold his job until 2008. Disregard that, I suck cocks. The Harris levels do not look like Columbine High School, and the enemies were the default ones from Doom.
