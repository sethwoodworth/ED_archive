'''''Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt''''' is an [[anime]] produced by Gainax and [[/a/|/a/'s]] latest [[furry|fetish]]. It has a [[Redneck|gun-wielding]] [[LittleCloud|super-bitch]], an [[Pedobear|adorable]], [[PissedOffVideoGamer|sugar-loving]] [[Goth|goth-lolita]], [[lesbian]] devil-sisters, black person (a first for anime), as well as a shitload of other things. By glancing at a [[cum|single thread]] on [[/a/]], you can gather that other than [[moe]] shit, no other anime has divided the [[weeaboo]] community quite like PSG has. Needless to say, to explain it in one introductory paragraph is pretty much impossible.

[[File:5de897c1d6b82359ed3211034138db52.png|thumb|right|what]]

[[tl;dr|The plot in over 140 characters]]: Two angels are kicked out of Heaven and must collect Heaven Coins; they are obtained by turning their [[wut|underwear into weapons]] and defeating Ghosts.

PSG is pretty different from any other [[anime]] out there. For one, the art style is has more of a [[Confederate States of America|"Western"]] feel to it, there's <s>a lot</s> '''A TON''' of [[Engrish|English]] ([[fuck|especially]] [[bitch|curse]] [[shit|words]]), [[shit|unrefined]] [[Cum|humor]], [[porn|actual sex]] (not just boring fanservice), outrageous fight scenes, jokes about both [[anime]] and [[cartoons]], a soundtrack that will [[srsly|blow your mind]], as well as a ridiculous plot. Therefore, its no wonder that there are only three opinions anyone can have on it:
*[[lie|Greatest fucking show ever made]], PSG is what anime should be. If you [[Rage|hate]] this show, you just [[Suicide|hate life in general]].
*[[truth|The worst fucking shit ever made]], anyone who watches this apparently has no [[cum|taste]] in anime. As if you could have a "taste" since you watch anime in the first place.
*[[Holy shit|JESUS FUCKING CHRIST]], WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST WATCH??

There seems to be no middle ground on PSG. Any PSG thread on /a/ is bound to be loaded with battles between [[U MAD]] macros and ''[[One Piece]]'' [[copypasta|copypastas]]. There always seems to be something to [[BAWWW|bitch]] about when this show is mentioned. Maybe its because it gets [[attention whore|too much attention]] and just needs a little [[trolling]] every now and then, [[shit no one cares about|who knows]]. Another [[Stupid|huge]] argument that seems to [[come]] up is that because PSG has such a Western style to it, whether or not it should really be considered [[Yes|"anime"]]. [[Faggots|Others]] try to discuss the "flaws" of this show, [[Unrealistic Expectations|hoping to convince someone dumber than themselves]], and of course, completely missing the point of the show in the first place. Either that, or [[Trollface|just trolling]].

== Characters ==
[[File:Abbeyroad.gif|thumb|right|I read the news today, oh boy.]]
*'''[[whore|Anarchy Panty]]''': [[Gb2 the kitchen|Un-slapped bitch]]. Panty is the source of about 90% of the [[No Cussing Club|cussing]], [[unfunny|sex jokes]], and [[Chris-chan|overall stupidity]] in this show. Her hobbies include [[Terri Schiavo|doing nothing]] and [[whore|getting fucked in every hole]]. In other words, your typical [[American]] [[Bitch|female]]. She has the power to turn underwear into guns. 
*'''[[EGL|Anarchy Stocking]]''': Panty's sister and The slut of the show. She seems to be the [[Bi-polar|polar opposite]] of Panty, she takes Ghost-hunting more [[srsly|seriously]]. Stocking dresses in a [[Gothic lolita|goth-loli]] get-up and likes [[Dick|sweets]]. She pretty much tries to be as [[Kawaii|moe]] as possible to please the more [[Pedophile|"hardcore"]] [[Virgin|anime fans]] out there, but she can be just as bitchy as Panty on occasion. She has the power to turn her stockings into [[cock|swords]]. Is an [[FFA]].
*'''[[nigra|Garterbelt]]''': Token black guy. He is a [[priest]] with a huge afro (that can ejaculate whenever they get a mission) that hands out missions to the heroines. Being a priest, he is of course, [[Pedophile|attracted to young boys]] and is into BDSM. We're actually being serious this time. Google it.
*'''[[chuck norris|Chuck]]''': This thing that only says [[Fuck|"Chuck"]] and gets the [[Stop posting|shit beaten out of him]] in every episode. A rip-off of some character from ''[[Invader Zim]]'' [[shit no one cares about|that nobody cares about]].
*'''[[basement dweller|Briefers Rock]]''': Your typical [[loser|geek]] in his [[high school]] years. Makes it [[Duh|plainly obvious]] that he wants to get into [[That's the joke|Panty's panties]]. I hope you're [[Trap|comfortable with your sexuality]], because you're going to be very familiar with Brief's [[penis]] by the end of the series. His dick is [[Circumcision|uncircumcised]] (that's bad in Japan), [[pretty cool guy|pretty big]], [[Virgin|ejaculates quickly]], [[Jesus|can restore angelic powers]], and can even [[4chan|unlock gigantic gates to hell]].
*'''[[attention whore|Scanty & Kneesocks]]''': [[Boxxy|Our queens]] and demonic versions of Panty and Stocking. They are obsessed with [[Forced Meme|RRRRRUURRUS]] and are better than Panty and Stocking at everything. Even [[Mrfetch|etiquette]], [[Gaydiamond|beauty]], [[Bobby hill|class]], [[Cindy Crosby|sports]], [[Paris Hilton|family status]], [[Goronchev|academics]], [[Bob Rehahn|vision]], and [[DeafKid10|hearing]]. They can turn their clothes into rifles and scythes. Holy shit, they don't fuck around.
*'''[[Nobody cares|Fastener]]''': The demon sisters' [[recolor]]ed Chuck.

== The Great Gainax Trolling of Christmas ==
[[File:Wtfgainax.jpg|thumb|right|A typical viewer reaction to episode 13.]]
At the eve of Christmas, [[Lie|many anons were ready to enjoy a joyful and happy Christmas with their friends, girlfriends and family]], when Gainax opened their goody bags and dropped a shit bomb on top of /a/ - they released the final episode of the animu. Minutes after the release /a/ was swarmed with [[butthurt]], [[rage]], [[hate]] and [[cry|tiers]] resulting in dozens of threads popping and hundred of [[rage]] filled posts to appear, caused by the excellent trolling of Gainax. Many people expected to be [[trolled]] by Gainax, but not on this level. At the end of the animu there was the mighty "To be Continued", but it's a fact that Gainax is only trolling us into thinking that there will be season 2. [[GG]] Gainax gg indeed!

== Episodes ==
[[File:Yes_dear_sister.jpg|thumb|right|Scanty on the left, Kneesocks on the right. Kneesocks is more popular because fags LOVE girls with glasses.]]
[[File:Gorillaz_PSG.jpg|thumb|right|Rock the house.]]
[[File:Stocking_skipping_with_basket.jpg|thumb|right|As close to [[moe]] you will get [[Awwright|For now....]]]]

*'''Excretion without Honor and Humanity''': The first episode and its about [[shit]]. A fitting analogy for the rest of the series for all the [[trolls]] out there. 
*'''Death Race 2010''': Panty and Stocking attempt to take down a [[what|ghost that has possessed a car and a train.]] 
*'''The Clamor of the Beehive''': [[Weeaboos]] cheer on our heroines as they take on a [[16 year old girl|bitchy cheerleader]] and the jocks that made their [[High School|highschool]] lives a living hell.
*'''Sex and the Daten City''': Panty becomes a [[Prostatot|movie star]] and promotes her first film. However, halfway through she mentions that this was actually NOT her [[Virgin|first time]] on camera. If you don't see where this [[Porn|joke]] is going by now, you're probably taking this show [[Serious Business|too seriously]].
*'''Catfight Club''': Girls fight over some [[Pocky|snack]] and we find out that Stocking has a thing for [[shibari]].
*'''Pulp Addiction''': Pretty much explains why the [[Creationist|Bible]] says you shouldn't masturbate.
*'''The Diet Syndrome''':[[Wapanese| MOUSHIKASHITE DIETO!?!?!?!?]]
*'''High School Nudical''': [[pedophile|An episode about a mass naked child event.]]
*'''The Runny''': Something about getting off from nose-picking. Naturally, only anonymous would understand.
*'''Vomiting Point''': [[Trollface|Typical Gainax-trolling]]. Shows [[Americans]] that [[Japan|Glorious Nippon]] is not really the [[Prison|magical wonderland]] they envision it to be.
*'''[[diablo|Les Diaboliques]]''': First episode to bring us our true queens: [[Bitch|Scanty]] & [[Whore|Kneesocks]].
*'''Transwhoremers''': Parody of "Transformers", also [[THE BEST|way better]] than any movie that [[Autism|Michael Bay]] has ever made.
*'''The Stripping''': [[Gambling|Casino-themed]] episode, pure [[fanservice]].
*'''...Of the Dead''': [[Zombie Apocalypse|Zombies]] are what's [[Traps|"in"]] right now, so naturally, they would need a zombie-themed episode. 
*'''1 Angry Ghost''': [[DUN DUN|Courtroom-themed]] episode about a [[That's the joke|flamboyant parody]] of 90s [[Tom Cruise]], Ren and Stimpy (who get married), and a monkey lawyer which is a reference to [[Phoenix Wright]].
*'''If the Angels Wore Swimsuits''': Obligatory beach episode.
*'''Ghost: The Phantom of Daten City''': Stocking dates Ghost [[Chris-chan]]. Srsly, he's got the shirt and everything.
*'''Inner Brief''': First part of Episode 10; [[inflation]] and [[mpreg]] abound.
*'''Chuck to the Future''': [[Threesome|Three-part]] episode featuring Chuck. Apparently an homage to classic American [[Anime|cartoons]].
*'''HELP! We are Angels''': The only reason why anyone would give a positive review of Episode 10.
*'''Once Upon a Time in Garterbelt''': An episode about Garterbelt's past, [[shit no one cares about|if you cared about him]]. Apparently, he's a BDSM-loving leather daddy.
*'''Nothing to Room''': [[Inuyasha|Filler]] [[Bleach|episode]].
*'''D.C. Confidential''': Obligatory [[Recaptcha|recap]] episode as well as some [[Twincest|lesbianism]] to hold your [[Penis|attention]].
*'''Panty + Brief''': Brief turns from [[You|pussy-ass nerd]] to [[Me|suave, handsome motherfucker]]. [[Truth|To get hot girls, all you have to do is be good-looking]]. This episode shot Brief's popularity to [[Iron Man Numbers|Iron Man levels]], probably because some anons see themselves in him. [[Pedophile|And some anons literally see themselves in him.]]
*'''Bitch Girls 1&2''': Its just like Gainax to go all-fucking-out for the final episode. And holy shit, [[not really|they delivered]]. You know what they're also [[Source|delivering]]? [[OH SHI-|Another season]]. Hey, you promised to suck their dick in exchange for season 2. Go ahead and set up an appointment, bitch.
