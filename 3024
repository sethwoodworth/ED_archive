Forced Meme Flamingo
{{Forced Meme}}

'''Forced Meme Flamingo''' is an [[irony|ironically]] recursive, blatantly forced [[meme]] that has recently made an appearance on [[4chan|4chan's]] /b/. The meme involves an image of a pink plastic lawn flamingo with a text bubble, in which posters are supposed to insert [[forced meme]]s. Many, however, choose to insert [[cock|other objects]]. The post normally begins with this copypasta, or something similar: "Hey /b/, Forced Meme Flamingo here. Put your favorite (or least favorite) forced memes in my text bubble, OH YAH!" Since some take the internet as [[serious business]], they consider the flamingo a form of [[cancer]] since it is [[stupid|forced itself]]. 

==The Meme==
...is forced. That's the entire point, making it one of the most [[retard]]ed memes ever.  Even though it isn't a meme.
