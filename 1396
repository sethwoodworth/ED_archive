Celsius

'''Celsius''' is a way of measuring temperature where 0 degrees is freezing and 100 degrees is boiling. Seems easy, right? '''WRONG.'''

Celsius was invented by a Frenchman, Yohann Celsius. The inherent Frenchness of this makes it difficult enough to cooperate with, but when you add the factor that no one in the United States uses/gives a shit makes it totally useless.

Fahrenheit, being made by a [[German]], obviously pwns any invention from [[France]], and thus it is used more commonly in the United States. [[USA]]ns are too cool to use the simple system of Celsius, citing the fact that we have nukes and you don't. This compelling argument, along with the fact that no one uses thermometers anymore, has combined to make it irrelevant.

Fahrenheit is one of those things only America uses, without realising that no one else does. America is a unique little snowflake like that.

Oh, and here's an interesting bit of information about Fahrenheit's system. Know how Celsius' uses water as the standard freezing and boiling temperatures? Fahrenheit thought he'd be totally unique if he used two '''DIFFERENT''' substances, wich means two different freezing and boiling temperatures. One for freezing point and one for boiling, completelly destroying any semblance of a pattern you could work off.
