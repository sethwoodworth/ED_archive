[[Image:FuckRealitySquared.jpg|thumb|What [[over 9000|over nine-thousand]] people think of realitysquared]]

Realitysquared is commonly known as the most incompetent [[fuck]]up of a [[mod]]erator ever to grace the [[internets]]. And boy does he grace it! He's made it all the way to being one of the top members of the administrative team over at DeviantART, where he lives up to the [[meme]] of being [[Chasethehedgehog|within the top 10%]].

There isn't much to know about this guy. If you are lost and lonely on dA, someone is spamming you, or worst of all; some 11 year old has stolen your work and is selling it as a print, do not expect any help. [[Srsly]], this guy actually ''lets'' shit like [http://firehorses.deviantart.com/ this] stay up.

[[Image:Bleh.PNG|thumb|RealitySquared cares about the community and feedback from the people. That's why he never responded to these comments further.]]

Realitysquared is infamous for two things among his [[failure]] of moderation work - the first is being incredibly lazy, and the second is for being absolutely clueless about [[copyright]] [[law]]. I guess you could say he's infamous for three things though, if you count his absolute [[fucktard]]ery to be a cornerstone of his moderating (it is). If this wasn't [[A_Plus|A+]] enough, realitysquared has the magical ability to combine all of these things into one great catchall for dealing with any problem.

As he said in the featured chat of 20th January, 2007; 

{{Quote|Highly popular animated childrens [sic] shows expect and even sometimes encourage fan art, and on the whole they ignore anything which doesn't involve the sale of their properties. By contrast private artists often get quite angered at people tracing. The decision for leniency for TV/Movies is also contingent on the person not trying to pretend it's a freehand drawing. [...]
''I'm well aware of Disney's somewhat draconian protection of their characters, however attempting to stop such artwork from being submitted would be like trying to plug a firehose with your finger''|Realitysquared, Using 'grown-up' words.}}

Ah, like any true foundation of a community, realitysquared is strongly opposed to anything that involves work, regardless of how illegal the alternative is. It will be a [[lulz|lulzy, lulzy]] day when DevianTART gets [[pwned]] by [[the man]]. He also has an excellent understanding of how copyright laws work - which is just [[gay|fabulous]] for somebody in such a high moderating postition. [[GG]], DeviantART. [[GG]].

Well, what can you expect from somebody who "self-educated <nowiki>[himself]</nowiki> in copyright law about 5 years ago" and "<nowiki>[owns]</nowiki> several research books on the subject"? Why, he practically has enough skillz to become an [[e-lawyer]]! Hm, might be overqualified though. In all honesty though, how does anybody go through life on the [[interweb]]s without picking up at least enough copyright law to know that if you allow traced artwork on a site that makes you money, [[ALLCAPS|YOU IS BREAKING THE LAW]], let alone after [[allegedly]] studying this law?? The mind boggles.

What's REALLY un-funny about RealitySquared is that a long time ago, with much lulz, he got arrested for art theft himself (WTF?????), and this very event was reported in deviantTART News.  Why he's still an admin, nobody knows.

==Ineptitude==
[[Image:Realitysquared fanart.png|thumb]]

Most users never even realize that realitysquared is [[b&|no longer allowed]] to create or change the [http://about.deviantart.com/policy/copyright/ copyright] and community policies on DevianTart.  He can edit or change the wording in the FAQ pages and explain them in his own words as he tries to enforce them, but in nearly each and every instance he only manages to [[fuck]] everything up. He used to have a degree of authority over these with some input from Artist Relations and Spyed, but with his usual dumbfuckery he created so much controversy and anger within the community that most of the staff got fed up and tired with his bullshit along with the clusterfucks he creates.  Helpdesk staff think of him as "that guy, you know.. the one you invite to a party after its over when you want everyone to leave.. you know, that obnoxious loser who everyone wants to avoid."  That's quite an accomplishment when you consider that most of the users on DevianTART are harmless [[sheeple]] all too willing to be treated like shit and whose anger is usually about as expressive as a sad-faced emote.  

Realitysquared soon fucked things up to the extent that his subordinates were later placed under Community Relations and told to report to someone else, but that didn't really matter since they were just as incompetent as him and later got the shaft.  One of Daniel's biggest fuck-ups was placing a complete sociopath named [http://subversive-imaginati.deviantart.com/  subversive-imaginati] as a member of the policy enforcement staff.  After going on a [[batshit insane|psychotic]] rampage and banning over a dozen artists for trivial or non-existent reasons, she was eventually removed from her position along with her co-worker (who were the only two people left serving under RealitySquared).  Afterwards it was revealed she had a history of abuse and was seeking professional medical help and psychological counseling. Go figure.  Unfortunately, due to Daniel’s insecurity and a [[Aspergers|fragile eggshell ego]], he never admitted the possible existence of any sort of problem despite the fact that every single ban the batshit-crazy bitch had issued was later overturned (the nutjob psychopath herself banned after harassing the pardoned users and being a general pain in the ass to the staff, even to spyed.), all his staff had been removed from their positions, and the privilege/responsibility of establishing policy had been taken away from him.

==Why the dA community sucks==

All the various copyright policies he tried to take credit for were thrown out and re-written.  The person who eventually took it over decided to adopt the [http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses Creative Commons] approach after a user’s suggestion. Of course, several others had also suggested it to Daniel in the past, but in his [[sarcasm|infinite wisdom]] he thought his understanding was better than a bunch of people who actually studied and practiced copyright issues. 

R^2 was also placed in charge of the [http://about.deviantart.com/policy/etiquette/ Etiquette Policy] and its enforcement in the hopes of improving people's on-line behavior.  Everything he wrote and tried to instate was dismissed after users laughed in his face while pointing out just how ignorant he was.  Even the two literature gallery directors were brought in to make the clusterfuck manifesto readable when Daniel tried to type up something half-way decent, but the good directors decided to scrap it and start fresh.  Good thing too, because every time he tries to tweak policy on something like banning or deleting comments, higher-ups usually have to either [[revert|reverse his decisions]] or make up new policies to fix the messes he creates.

One initiative that Realitysquared tried to take was making DevianTART a socially acceptable and squeaky-clean [[fascist|fascistic]] environment that would be acceptable to even the youngest of little tots, born out of the belief (or is it knowledge?) that most of the community is made up of whiny bitches who can’t handle the slightest bit of nudity or violence in the works of others without calling the artists psychotic perverts. What ultimately resulted was an interbutts version of a Sesame Street artistic community. Such examples of policy enforcement include, but are by no means limited to: erotic material being deemed pornographic (fuck the Renaissance, amirite?), material including [[drug]] use being inappropriate (because people who have been affected negatively by drug use don’t deserve art as a possible medium to express their own emotions), and violent or graphic material no longer being allowed (because all depictions of violence are bad, even when its condemning the use of it).

Walk into any art museum and you can see just how shittily DevianTart represents any respectable art community. Probably a third of the showcased art would not be accepted at a place like dA. Definitely not anything by Michelangelo with all his [[fag]] nudes. When this issue drew the attention of senior staff members, one of the typical drawbacks of crybaby administrators such as Realitysquared manifested itself – bitching long and hard with bullshit self-justifications while ignoring what anyone else has to say, often having the last word simply because most sane people will eventually tire of hitting their heads against a brick wall. I mean, fuck, even little kids have better sense in knowing when to shut their mouths when fighting a losing battle, but the torrent of [[bullshit]] that flows out of can’t be plugged up by anything except for [[nigra]] deepthroats. You can thank Realitysquared for building an artistic community that only represents small children and their refrigerator drawings.

So how do you measure success?  That's easy - just look at the result.  Obviously a site like deviantArt has decided to create an environment where the art greatly lacks originality and quality because of its decisions, mostly due to Realitysquared's direction.  There is no other proof needed of an [[epic fail|epic failure]], just have a look for yourself and compare it to just about any art collection in a museum, gallery, or book in the library.

[[This is why we can't have nice things]], faggots.

==Discovery of the child genius==
[[Image:devianTART_Professionalism.png|thumb|150px|RealityImpaired's middlename is "Comedy"! [[whores|Chicks]] dig that shit.]]
Jew was and still is notorious for his participation in the [[Phoenix Wright|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]] online diploma program. In a show of skill and grandeur Realitysquared snatched the 1994 [[Phoenix Wright|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]] World Championship. With this victory, he was granted absolute knowledge of copyright law -- guaranteed by his stylish dick shaped trophy. 

With an infant DeviantART facing the menace of extreme policy breaches and hacker stackers this gregarious, master blaster Realitysquared was desperately sought after by the DeviantART Administration. He was found in 2002 CE, when war was beginning. His immaculate knowledge of the law, and charismatic personality helped turn the course of the war into today’s present impasse.

Early in 2004 though, the New York Times leaked a story involving Realitysquared, claiming he had beaten [[Phoenix Wright|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]] in a mere two days. He was then made PC Gamer's Man Of The Year for 2005. Shortly after Gamespot.com revealed that Daniel Realitysquared (his birth name) was actually a hidden character in [[Phoenix Wright|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]] that could be unlocked by clearing all court cases without actually winning them.

==Good moderation is something you should pay for==
[[Image:FDDLuvsReality2.png|thumb|[[Whore|Suck-up]] practically begging him for internet sex.]] 

Realitysquared also has decided that it is probably a good idea to treat the popular DeviantART, the ones who have paid money to be "subscribed", differently than the lowly peons whose pageviews are not [[over nine thousand]]. In fact, he is so stuck on this, that he will drop the [[banhammer]] on newly registered people for such terrible things as having [[anonymous]] in their names, but will allow [[attention whore]]s to [[Firedarkdragon|post journals asking their legions of fantards to attack people, post copyrighted music on their artwork for download and generally harass people]] as much as they like with no punishment to speak of. If you message the helpdesk asking why the hell the moderation team is so incompetent and [[fucktard]]ed, you'll get such lovely and helpful responses as [http://help.deviantart.com/96/ READ THIS] or [http://help.deviantart.com/160/ READ THIS.]

'''And whatever you do... don't comment on the pages of [[lolcow]]s like [[chasethehedgehog|chasethehedgehog's]] or [[DivineAngel|DivineAngel's]], or Realitysquared will [[banhammer|ban you for life]]. srsly'''

*It also appears he can't read. My carefully researched, link filled, multi-paragraphed request to unban my account is met with a "banned for /b/ harassment" sign on my userpage. I'm not even a fucking /b/tard. WTF? -[[User:Cirrus|Cirrus]]
*"Friend: "That was the faggot admin I argued with when I was B&" Me: "he needs to be fired" " -[[User:Robocod|Robocod]]
*DA, wtf r u doin. -{{lj|schkyzm}}
*RealitySquared is a bitch. Nuff' said. -{{lj|greatparakeet}}
*Reality Squared...more like...RETARDEDLY IMPAIRED! -{{lj|catawampuskitty}}
*Reality Squared is a fucking asswipe. He banned me for 'participating in a raid against divineangel' and then said something about deserving it. He thinks he is so bloody brilliant when, truly, he is a complete moron. -[http://skeletonxcrew.deviantart.com/ skeletonxcrew]
*Reality squared is so full of shit it's not funny. -{{lj|surgat}}
*Around Squared, be prepared! - [[User:Malomeat|Malomeat]]
*"oh for fuck sake, get him removed" - Psyke, friend of Robocod
*WHAT IS THIS FAGGOT ADMIN? -[[User:Ksaisei|Kumori]]
*He didn't even ban [[Firedarkdragon|Firefag]] despite all the harm she did, LOOSER --[[User:BadFurDay|<font color="#880088">Great justice</font>]] <sub>[[User:BadFurDay|BadFurDay]]</sub>
*He has a bias to paid and popular users. Even when presented with a questioning and insulting piece of art that called his methods into question, he left it be, because the user was a paid user and getting close to 20k pageviews.hm......just like [[Firedarkdragon|Fdurduh]] -{{lj|lougaraswifthrt}}
*See that image [above] about realityfailed's stance on copyright violations? That user he was talking about who was "twisting" established policy to further their personal agenda? That person who is trying to discredit him by publicizing his retarded comment on copyright violations? That was me. Fuck you, faggot. Fuck you hard. -{{lj|kassichu}}
*I think I've gotten into more arguments with realitysquared than anyone else on the whole net, as far as art goes at least *sigh* I spent a month arguing DA's pornography rules with him/her and personally, I don't think he/she cares how inconsistent or badly enforced DA"s rules are. What ever is easiest to enforce seems to be the thought. -_- -{{lj|ani_bester}}
*The funniest thing about the whole RS/tracing drama is that DevianTART's registrar is Go-Daddy. Go-Daddy is absolutely ANAL about copyright (god I love 'em) - if they get sent DMCA's they get straight to shutting down servers. -{{lj|merlin_the_wise}}
*RealitySquared? Ah, yes. That's the [[homosexual|modfag]] who wrongfully accused me of [[rape|raiding]], then perma-b& me for being the "leader of /b/", despite having [[over 9000]] pageviews and a valid subscription. Leader of /b/, huh? I guess Anonymous really IS my personal army, after all. Sounds like someone should [[anonymous|do a little research next time]]. Then it wouldn't have been necessary to show him how [[Snapesnogger#Epic_deviantART_Raid_fallout_hits_Snapesnogger_-_7th_November_2006|sadly mistaken]] he really was. - [http://2401penitenttangent.deviantart.com 2401PenitentTangent]
*Prick banned me for being a 4channer. I resent this, since the incitement to join my raid, which led to my ban, was on 7chan. What a fag. [http://darbysniper.deviantart.com/ DarbySniper]
*A forum thread of mine got locked by him because it was a sexual topic of sorts. Yet I specifically remember seeing a different thread elsewhere, titled "What's the best way to give head?" that was never locked, and was in fact, a very popular thread. When arguing with R^2 over the "appropriateness" of sex-based discussions, it didn't take long to conclude that he was, and is, a virgin. [[User:Earl_of_Sandwich|Earl]]
* Ok, me showing that I hold the copyright for what I was drawing is harassment, but that faggot [http://primus.deviantart.com/gallery/ Primus] is allowed to use pics from Hannibal Lector movies? What a hypocrite! [[User:Black sonata|Aria]]
* Relalitysquared is such a fucking prick. I post ONE link to the GNNA, and he gets all dAmn bannin' on meh! -Level20X6
* Hey hey, one of you guys who got banned for supposedly being /b/ or chan related: What do you think of the [[April Fool's]] Joke they had? You know, the one where they replaced everyone's avatars with "SO I HERD U LIEK MUDKIPS"? Oh, devianTART. [[User:DameGreyWulf|Dame]] 02:42, 16 November 2008 (CST)
* I posted "HI" on Chasethehedgehog's page and Rsquared banned me with a message "ED TROLL". I have 2k pageviews and I don't spout memes like a [[newfag]]. WTF IS THIS RealitySQUAWKENSQUAAAAAAWKSQUAAAAWKENSQUAAAAAAWK. [[User:Emc2trooper|exxora]]
* Realitysquared clearly can't tell the difference between "spreading rumors" and "getting attacked by a well known troll". My harassment report for a guy who is ban evading and harassing users with over 32 accounts got completely shrugged off because I asked who the guy was in a public place. Can't wait for that Chad Syphrett to get that mod status, can ya R2? -Adel
