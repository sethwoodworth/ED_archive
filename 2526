EBWFGame1
== EBWFGame1 ==
'''EBWFGame1''' is a game played on the [[eBaum's World]] [[Forum]]. It is the first such game ever attempted at that site. The game involves its players going around to various sites on the internet, finding clues and deciphering [[Emo|poems]] in order to continue finding the next locations. The ultimate goal is yet unknown by most, but it is widely believed that there is at least some sort of prize for those who complete the challenge. Although it should be noted that it is also entirely possibly that it is all [[for the lulz]]. The game is not to be confused with [[The Game]].

== History ==
The game first began on February 10, 2008. Thus far, the participants have had to go through the following steps...

*Go to a specific hosted image on [[imageshack]].

*This image was a screen shot of a forum URL.

*99% of this forum contained posts which begged the question, "[[lol wut]]?"  but there was one post with a poem.

*This poem, once deciphered, had people go to a specific picture hosted on [[flickr]].

*This picture was of a screen shot of an [[AIM]] window with a user name.

*Once people messaged this user name, they got an away message reply.

*This away message contained another poem, which linked back to another member's profile on EBWF.

*This profile contained a link to [[rapidshare]].

*The file downloaded from rapidshare contained a text file with an email address inside.

*Once you email this address, it autoreplies with a link to a quote on bash.org.

*The quote on [[bash.org]] is a poem which, once deciphered, told them to download a torrent file from thepiratebay.org.

*This [[torrent]] file contained a .wav audio file of a computer's voice, telling people the URL of a link to YouTube.com.

*This [[YouTube]] channel contained only one video. It was a video of a URL to YTMND.

*The YTMND page contained a poem which lead people to this Encyclopedia Dramatica page.

*This Encyclopedia Dramatica page.

==Then who was phone?==
But if the author of this article promised to continue on 03/17/08 and by the time of this writing it is 08/04/09, [[Then who was phone?]]. Was it [[Operation Falcon Punch|Oversight]]? His [[Troll|true identity]] will never be known.
