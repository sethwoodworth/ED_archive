IRT

'''IRT''', or "'''Incident Response Team'''" is an [[IRL]] trolling organization and branch of the [[Internet Military]] that trolls [[animu]] [[convention]]s.  Only, instead of [[I did it for the lulz|doing it for the lulz]], they do it [[for great justice]]. IRT's only job is to control the lunatics who permeate [[animu]] cons. However, being [[batshit]] crazy themselves, [[fail]]ure is the only option.

The Idiot Retardation Train was founded in [[2005]] in order to control Anime Central which was [[over 9000]] attendees for the first time that year and has recently moved into the territory of [[ED:Lulzcon 07 planning|Lulzcon]]. The Internet Reinforcement Troop were initially tasked with combating the growing threat of people holding up signs at Anime Central. [[Pedophilia|13 year old girls]] used to hold up sheets of paper asking for sex until it was b&, because virgins wanted to get laid is a horrible thing, worse than raping babies.

==[[Epic]] [[Fail]]age at [[Lulzcon]]==
[[Image:Mootfail.jpg|thumb|right|Leader of lulzcon IRT fail]]
Some [[gaiafag]] from IRT who doesn't know ED and thought it was a [[4chan]] con, somehow tricked [[Girlvinyl]] into letting them provide [[troll|security assistance]] at [[lulzcon]].  This started out as a major problem for the convention, but soon lead to epic lulz when the entire team was [[Perma-ban|perma-b&]] from lulzcon and all lulz related activities. And nothing of value was lost.

The story begins when some gaiafag, apparently wasted the time of someone who ran the con and BEGGED for the position of head security troll.  After saying [[Attention whore|"OMGPLZ!!OMGPLZ!! INEEDPOWERTOFUELMYUNWARRANTEDSELFIMPORTANCEBECAUSEIAMANATTENTIONWHORE!!!"]], [[Fucktard|someone said "Sure...., it can't hurt, right?"]]

IRT then went about taking charge of the con.  They were allowed to bring about 3 or 4 other IRT people to help with shit like guarding the cashbox, making sure no [[furry|furries]] or gaiafags got in, and stuff like that.  But, since IRT is a group of [[goatse|professionals]], who all have experience in running [[con|conventions]] and black belts in martial arts and stuff, it looked like they convinced Girlvinyl to allow them to bring ten [[fag|ops]], they ended up bringing 14 asshats including several [[Fail|furries, weeaboo]] and other people who just DIDN'T belong.  The whole time Mandy, 'the fail in charge' thought that, even though less than sixty people actually came, there where going to be hundreds of people and that they would riot and fuck up the hotel, meaning that only the power of furfags and weeaboo could hold anonymous in check.  She also thought it was a [[4chan]] convention.

==The [[Ban fucking everyone|Ban]]==
Mandy was so scared of Girlvinyl, she had another girl in cat ears, tail, [[Wapanese|stripey socks]], and [[Goth|matching]] [[Fat|corset]] approach Girlvinyl on [[Caturday|Saturday]] night.  This girl indicated that IRT would not be wearing their superduper [[Buy A Dog|protective]] security vests, after having removed them in disgust (or possibly misunderstanding) of [[Lulz|lulz]] (or possibly reality).  It was suggested instead that IRT not show in the morning, Sunday, for the last day of Lulzcon.

By showing up early Sunday morning, the remainder of the IRT team was slightly allowed to stay until they started misbehaving inappropriately.  Indicating, "[[Brb]]", Girlvinyl was thought to attend a short meeting in the [[Tubgirl|powder room]], but we instead found out that she [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dropping+the+cosby+kids+off+at+the+pool dropped the [[Cosplay|cosplay]] kids off by the [[AIDS|pool]]].
