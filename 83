3OH!3
[[Image:3oh3homo.jpg|thumb|Definitely [[lie|not gay]]]]

'''3OH!3''' (pronouced like a [[American|faggot douche]], ''Three Oh Three'') is a two piece [[Techno|electro]]-[[Rap|hip-hop]] group from [[Colorado]], [[USA|US of A]]. '''3OH!3''' consists of '''Sean Foreman''', 23, and '''Nathaniel [[Moot|Motte]]''', 25, who are both [[white]] and think that they can rap.  Motte's last name was a common 18th century word used in ribald literature of the time as a synonym for [[pussy]], appropriately. 3OH!3 is known for their lack of skill of any sort and their incomprehensible nonsense they call songs, which are really performance pieces consisting of [[pussy|Motte]] and [[penis|Foreskin]] shouting over a beat from a cheap keyboard. '''3OH!3''' are also blatant [[Awesome|misogynists]], which can clearly be heard in their [[Cool_Story_Bro|no. 1 single]], ''Don't Trust Me’’.

==FROM DA WEST COAST==

Just like [[rap|NWA, Wu-Tang Clan, and Jurassic 5]], 3OH!3 had it's hardcore beginnings. Sean Fagman invited his fuck buddy Nathan over for their usual day long session of [[Heath Ledger|bare backing.]] Afterward while they were cleaning the sperm and feces off of each other whilst dropping rhymes in their spare time, they formulated a plan to get some [[scene]] pussy. They would borrow the talents of other artists and be a totally artificial hip music group, and so they decided it was a good idea as they could also keep fucking each other on the side.

After some thinking and some more [[in the ass|"rhyme dropping"]], they went with a name that was hip, cool, freSh and dope. 3OH!3, after their [[Colorado|area code]] and the way it sounds when you say it. Clever huh?

Oddly, unlike some of their [[Crunkcore]] [[faggot|contemporaries]], they are the closest thing to [[sXe|straight-edge]] in their genre, probably due to their [[Hipster]] agenda or their being far too white to truly have experienced the wonderful effects of [[drugs]] stronger than a couple cans of [[PBR]]. Not that they ARE sXe, as they do drink and [[Rape|"sleep with"]] [[Men|"women"]], but their snarky commentary on most drugs, [[vegan|being carrot-eaters]], and promoting a belief in [[Jesus|some Jew nailed to 2x4s eons ago]] as an alternative to being a dipshit [[Scene|Scenefag]] puts them in a pretty close comparison. Whatever their reasons, this has brought about questions of the validity of being in a genre of [[BrokeNCYDE|attention-whoring]] [[Millionaires|alcoholics]] who do lots of drugs and/or dongs; these questions mostly being, "WHY DO YOU CALL US CRUNKCORE BAAAAAW?" The simple answer is of course they still share a common bond - [[wigger|h8tin' bitches and being white]]

== Musical Style ==

Considering that this kind of music and it's listeners are all mainstream losers it can be hard to consider any of it original or containing any kind of talent.  

Nonetheless, 3OH!3 can be considered [[rap]]/crunk/electronica/rock/[[icp|pop]], or the proper term, [[shit]].  Lyrics are either presented in the form of "rap", or a [[MCR|familiar whiny yelling.]]  Lyrics usually consist of talking about how much [[dick|ass]] they get from your girlfriend, how much of their parents money they spend on cheap beer, or that they can definitely kick your ass no matter what.  Also remember that cussing a lot makes you cool.

== Misogynists ==

Like every other rap group in existence, '''3OH!3''' are massive [[Faggot|misogynists]], which stems from their [[Buttsecks|deep]] seated [[Gay|homosexuality]] that can clearly be heard in their lyrics. Many [[butthurt]] lesbians have been noted to disagree with '''3OH!3's''' [[Awesome|sexist]] lyrics. But here at [[ED]] we know they are simply [[Women|stating]] [[Like|the]] [[Fellatio|obvious]]. Never-the-less, for the purpose of NPOV, here is a [[cumdumpster]] outraging about '''3OH!3's''' lyrics during a live show.

{{quote|Went to check out the Colorado-based, Bamboozle-friendly rap-rock duo '''3OH!3''' at SXSW on the recommendation of a stranger, and while I won’t say I “enjoyed” their set, I was definitely fascinated by the pocket of cult fandom I wandered into at Stubbs that afternoon. Lots of girls screaming at their pelvic-thrusting dance moves, which I’m not convinced were ironic; lots of concern for those girls as they gleefully chanted along with lyrics that no amount of irony could save from being kinda offensive. From ''Starstrukk'' (”Push it baby push it baby out of control / I got my gun cocked tight and I’m ready to blow”) to ''I’m Not Your Boyfriend Baby'' (self-explanatory), there seemed to be a running string of, if not misogyny, then at least lack of respect for the female gender underpinning every hooky, shouty, high-energy song — but it was their closing number that really pushed me over the edge.|[http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/03/29/3oh3s-dont-trus/|Whitney Pastorek]}}

=== Katy Perry fucks up their song ===

In this video you can see [[Katy Perry]] jumping around like an idiot in a blue dress, fucking up the lyrics (pretty much just repeating the word "Ho" over and over like fucking [[Satan|Santa Claus]] and generally being a douche bag [[whore]], including stage diving into the crowd and recieving [[Goatse]] from hundreds of people.
