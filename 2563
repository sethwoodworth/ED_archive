ETD
<b>Electronically Transmitted Diseases</b>, or eTDs, are a group of physical and psychological ailments that have been identified as being spread through use of [[internets]].  This wide range of illnesses has been present for over 30 years, but has recently reached [[serious business|pandemic proportions]]. Not all eTDs pose serious threats to public health and hygiene, but some can be quite devastating. It is expected that, within the next 5 years, everyone on the planet will have an eTD, or will personally know someone who does. [[Internet Disease]] is the most widely know example of an eTD.

==How eTDs are Transmitted==

{{warning|Unprotected contact with internet tubes may be hazardous to your health.}} 


===Pac-Man Fever===

The first illness to be classified as an eTD was [[Pac-Man]] Fever. This malady was quickly transmitted through groups of people as they came in close proximity to each other while lined up at arcades of ill repute.  A later strain of the disease was actually propagated using radio airwaves as [[shitty band|Ted Nugent's]] arcade anthem of the same name was forced upon the general public. Symptoms commonly included: a slight limp caused by carrying $25.00 in quarters in a single pocket, increased reports of ghost sightings, complete loss of control in one hand, and an overwhelming urge to eat everything in sight.  Pac-Man Fever was not a chronic condition, it could be easily managed by a dose of Dragon's Lair.

===Himpes===

Himpes is a mutated strain of [[Herpes]] and is spread when an internet user becomes ensnared in an internets [[trap]].  There is no cure for Himpes, it is [[evar|4evar]].  This strain is not widespread due to the severely limited sexual activity of most [[user|netizens]].  If you contract this disease, the only treatment available is courtesy of [[Dr Kevorkian|Dr. Jack Kevorkian]].

===Persistent Argumentative State===

This disease arises from constant [[flaming]], [[edit war|edit-warring]], and [[forum]] participation.  This habit of disputing every [[important|minor detail]] will then slowly spread to [[IRL]]. PAS is considered a gateway disease because symptoms of other eTDs will go unnoticed due to the fact that [[noone]] in the real world is willing to associate with you. Physical symptoms include a marked increase in scrapes, cuts and bruises resultant from constant IRL ass-kickings. Diarhhea of the mouth occurs in typical cases, and often requires the victim to have someone rip them a new asshole in order to alleviate the extreme pressures caused by being completely full of shit. A current hot spot for this condition is [[wikipedia]].  The only way to stop the occurrence of PAS is to quarantine the entire [[wikipedian]] community and apply a Hades Bomb directly to the source. Common [[STFU]] treatments fail to cure this disease and often times will only encourage the victim to [[sand hero|bury their head in the sand]] and begin [[zoe|talking out of their ass]]. If you come into contact with someone in this condition you should [[Terri Schiavo|'pull the plug']] as quickly as possible.

===Wiki Break with Reality===

This psychological condition occurs when [[sheep|someone]] commits every waking hour to spreading vast amounts of misinformation via wikipedia.  The victim is unable to determine [[fact]] from [[lies|fiction]]. Victims are also found to commit acts of [[Jimbo Wales|Idol Worship.]] This condition is  technically an "umbrella syndrome," as it is the result of multiple diseases.  Dyslexia, Brackets, Dangling Participle, Autism, Conjunctionitis and [[drama|drama dependency]] all are factors that contribute to the overall condition. People suffering from this disease are very difficult to treat as they require that you produce [[citation needed|supporting citations]] for everything that you say.  Original research has show that the only effective way to bring someone back from wikiworld is to perform a Complete Personality Transplant. CPTs are potentially fatal so it is a win-win situation.

Dangling Participle can be effectively treated with an application of Prepostion-H, which will reduce the swollen run-on sentences employed by the victim in an effort to appear credible.

===Multiple Personality Disorder===

A person who constantly employs [[sockpuppet]]s will eventually be unable to distinguish actual discussion from the conversations he has with himself. This disease can actually be beneficial to the general public as victims are quite content to stay in [[basement dweller|seclusion]] and [[fap|entertain themselves]], thereby sparing others from their invariably occurring PAS.  Sock Puppet Bi-polarism occurs when two of the puppets become so entrenched in their pitching/catching roles that the victim no longer knows, or cares, what their intentions are. Severe physical harm is possible when an MPD interacts with the public, as they are so used to a strength-in-numbers mentality that they forget they have no back-up. Real world people are not intimidated by your avatar's fangs, scars and laser-eyes.

===The Game===

Users of [[Internets|teh internets]] may become players of [[The_game|The Game]]. [[You|You]] should probably look that up now, because not only are you now [[fap|playing]] [[The_game|The Game]] (as of [[At_least_100_years_ago|at least 100 years ago)]]), but [[You|you]] have just [[fail|lost]] [[The_game|The Game]].

==Common Symptoms==

Some general symptoms are indicative of many different types of eTDs. They go largely unnoticed as society has completely shunned the carriers of such diseases.

The list of indicators include:
*[[Basement-dweller|Extreme paleness of skin]]. This is often accompanied by a [[tool|transparent personality]].
*[[pain series|Permanent ocular glaze]].
*[[retard|No longer their speech coherent is]].
*[[fap fap fap|Fingers have been worn down to the first knuckle]].
*The constant use of [[buttsechs|back doors]].
*[[batshit insane|Frequently trying to start conversations with house plants]].
