[[Paul Reubens]] is an [[unfunny]] [[retard]] [[pedophile]] who somehow managed to get [[famous]]. His main character is a [[faggot]] of [[epic]] proportions, Pee Wee Herman. After [[you fail it|failing it]] while trying to get on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', he successfully landed a contract with HBO. This was the beginning of the shitstorm of [[stupid]] that was to follow, and unfortunately still continues to this day.

== The Pee Wee Herman Show ==

This show basically consisted of Pee Wee standing on stage and pulling [[jenkem|shit out of a paper bag]]. Can you say "[[ghey]]"? [[condescension|Of course you can]].

== Pee Wee's Big Adventure ==

[[Teh]] [[Best]] movie [[Evar]]. Some [[Jews|movie execs]] at Warner Brothers Studios were smoking [[crack]] one day, and decided to let Paul Reubens make his very own movie. The touching story of a [[fruit]]y, albino, [[Malcolm X]]-dressing motherfucker who has lost his [[bike]] and spends the rest of the movie searching for it. It also gave [[Tim Burton]] a job, which he did [[for the lulz]].

== Pee Wee's Playhouse ==

The ramblings of Pee Wee Herman on [[peyote]] set to television, ''Pee-Wee's Playhouse'' <s>is</s> was an obnoxious show that steadily lowered [[retards|viewers]]' I.Q.s by the minute. Talking chairs, wish-granting genies, and a friendly mail-woman. And a robot too. After being completely forgotten since [[Last Thursday]], it came back on [[Adult Swim]]. The only person who watched was [[you]].
