[[Image:Sunderedmoon not furry.JPG|thumb|Not a furry? His LJ interests seem to disagree, [[amirite|amirite!?]]]]

Normally, if someone told you that there was an artist out there who was so pretentious and elitist that even [[furfags]] would ridicule and make lulz from them, you would [[GTFO|laugh in that person's face]]. Well, despite all odds and [[common knowledge]], such a person exists.  '''SundereredMoon''' or '''Midnight Dragon''' is a [[lolcow|Lol-cow]] of such pomposity he posted a set of rules telling everyone else that they are not artists because of one reason or another, in the lame attempt to make himself feel more professional in the face of his obviously [[Crap|mediocre]] art skills. 

Of course, since furries are never immune to [[drama]], [[Butthurt|angry]] comments and [[lulz]] are both currently in [[epic]] quantities in the original journal. Already, furfags have taken it upon themselves to make official certification labels and Put Boobs on Tigers. In other words, it's business as usual.

Also, according to SunderedMoon, he is not a "furrie". It can only be assumed that with his /b/elow-average level vocabulary he means he is not a furry. This is made totally apparent by the fact that he draws tigers with boobs and posts them on [[FurAffinity]]. No, this man could not possibly be a "furrie".
__TOC__
[[Image:Sunderedmoon_pheldspar.jpg|thumb|left|No, this certainly isn't "furrie art". '''''[[PROTIP]]:''''' note the superb blending of animal and human features, and the delicate detail on the tit which makes it appear to be printed on a T-shirt.]]
== 1000 Get! ==

In quite possibly the swiftest uprising of furfag [[drama]] in not-that-recent memory, SunderedMoon has managed to get [[at least 100]] furfags to stop looking at their furry [[Porn|artwork]] long enough to read and comment on how much of a retard he is.  Despite having made the initial journal post a month prior to the first comment, the real fun started when [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/wereblood a user named Wereblood] finally cared to post something on August 12th.  This (and SunderedMoon's almost immediate response to Wereblood) saw the thread grow with a deluge of angry furfags and a good dose of hate rage.  Failing to see when it is better to cut and run, SunderedMoon also continued to defend his stance on Actual [[Art]] and 'Artistic Skill' with [[Retardation|dismissive insult]]s, thereby cementing his status as a massive douche.  The thread continues to grow, now having broken 1,000 responses, with even more [[lulz]] and [[drama]] expected to ensue.

The journal he probably wrote to make himself feel like hot shit has worked against him and now that he is hated by what looks like all the [[furfags]] in all of furfaggotry, he will probably become [[Chris Benoit|An Hero]].

== The 'Artist' ==

Directly from Sunderedmoon's [[Bullshit|amazingly]] and technologically [[Crap|superior]] website:

"Official Web Site: www.sunderedmoon.com
Location: Virginia, USA
J. M. Harris, alias Midnight Dragon, was born on March 30th, 1977. Six years total Tech Schooling in Graphic Arts, Advertisment, and Computer Illustration make up the artistic background of Midnight; though the training only fueled a partial desire for an already unstoppable need to place one's mind upon page. The true talent and inspiration came from life and the love of it, as well as the alien dreams that plagued Midnght's every night with their visage."

So there we have it.  [[FYIAD|Midnight Dragon]], AKA Sunderedmoon, has dreamed about [[Secks|relations]] with [[Alien|aliens.]]  Surely a [[Sick Fuck|perfectly normal person.]]

There also apparently those who certify art, such as [[Thewielder|Thewielder]]

== Meme-worthiness ==
[[Image:CertifiedIcons.JPG|thumb|Icon Certification]]
While MidnightMoon/SunderedDragon/[[WTF]]ever is made of too much [[fail]] and [[AIDS]] to be a [[meme]], the idea of certified artistry depicting tigers with [[boobs]] is taking FA by storm.  At this point, it even threatens to spread faster than [[Krystal Can't Enjoy Her Sandwich]].


== Trolls ==

The [[lulz]] generated by his [[Stupid|intelligent]] [[ass]]essments of art of course spawned [[troll|retaliation]] of all sorts, naturally including parody. A parody of his user page was soon born, as [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/saunteredmoans/ "Sauntered Moans"] showed [[shoop da whoop|his horrible darkened face]] on the earth's surface, bringing with him extreme [[faggotry]] such as over-analyzed, poorly drawn art and an [[epic]] [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/722840/ theme song for SunderedMoon]. Also, crawling from the depths of [[Your Mom|hell]], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/sunderedmoonsartteacher Sundered Moons art teacher], coming to rid the world of unlicensed artists and crap art, such as not-Tiger-With-Boobs. Despite complete awesomeness, the users were soon banned on grounds of [[Butthurt|slander]], since, you know, clearly it isn't SATIRE, and it wasn't totally uncalled for.

== Butthurt ==

Like many victims of [[Troll|trolling]], Sunderedmoon felt the [[Butthurt]], going so deep it was coming out of his mouth, a net improvement from what was coming out before. In a [[Lame|brilliant]] attempt to protect his ass, a [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/184863/ journal] was dedicated to the cause, claiming that it was all an elaborate scheme in order to get replies. However, this is obviously a [[Lie]]. Anyone who believes this journal, and that he actually received emails and support from some people, should immediately contact their local doctors in order to become [[An Hero]]s and put an end to their stupidity.

Some might assume that this "test" was the reason Sundered stopped replying to [[Flamer|users]]; it would be after all an overwhelming amount of work that even [[Chuck Norris|God]] would have difficulty with. However, a short (yet conclusive) study you can perform yourself shows that his logging-in pattern is irregular. On submissions, the original comments ( "[[Idiot|Omg oh wooow kewl diz is amazin i cnt get over it i ttly came lol!!!!]]" ) are replied to on either the day of submission, or a few days later. The same applies to Sundered's journals (both on [[FA]] and on [[LJ]] ), and it is so safe to assume that he had originally not even seen the comments, (replies were made on the 12th, but it was the first commentator's posts. A few more came on the 13th, and then everything went fucking nuts on the 14th) and logged on a few days later in horror. After remaining in the fetal position for hours (maybe days???) and considering [[suicide]] and/or [[delete fucking everything|deleting fucking everything]], the [[butthurt]] journal was birthed, amirite?
Also, it should be noted that the journal which started the whole [[Drama|srs bsnss]] was submitted <i>exactly</i> a month before the first post. <i><b><u>HOW CREEPY IS THAT?!!?!?!!??</u></b></i>

[[Last Thursday]], Sunderedmoon realized that [[i did it for the lulz]] just didn't cut it for the [[furfags]] as an excuse, so he went ahead and [[delete fucking everything|baleeted fucking everything]], including journals and comments left on his userpage.
[[Image:Butthurt sunderedmoon.jpg|thumb|[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Butthurt but im better!!]]]
[[Image:Stillbutthurt sunderedmoon.jpg|thumb|[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Butthurt NO, SRSLY1!!]]]

Then suddenly, without warning, Sunderedmoon started spamming his own page with images of mating animals [[Image:Sunderedfail.jpg|thumb|left]] and completely destroyed his own website to show how butthurt he is and how he's abandoning furdom. [[Image:Sunderedfail2.jpg|thumb|left]]
== How to Become a Certified Artist ==
[[Image:Tittigerrain.jpg|thumb|I SMELLZ CERTIFICATION.]]
1. Pretend to art all over something, then show it off to [[Nobody|anyone that cares]].

2. Call almost every other artist on the planet 'Not an Artist', watch ensuing [[batshit insane]] [[Drama|Dramafest]]

3. Maintain being a pretentious [[asshole]], all the while [[Masturbation|fapping]] to tiger [[boobs]]

4. [[????]]

5. [[PROFIT]]

== Masochism ==

After being talked about, ridiculed, shunned and forgotten, Sunderedmoon still attempts to call attention to himself one way or another.
This includes getting [[AIDS]], Auto-pwnage, banning himself and enduring the worst company ever, that is SunderedMoon himself.

{{quote|<small><small>Remember when Cartoon Network used to be commercial free and show the old ass cartoons? Remember when they used to only have cartoons and not shit like that mike and bobs super-awsome show great job or whatever the hell those retarded flaming fags call that shit? What about Saul of the Mole Men? How the fuck did ANY of that garbage get on Cartoon Network? Now its getting worse. They are starting to show movies on their "Cartoon Movie" that arent even cartoons.

Maybe they should rename the channel to "Your only going to see one show that isnt gay as hell or stupider then Pee-Wees Playhouse."</small></small>|Sunderedmoon|[[fucktard]]}}
