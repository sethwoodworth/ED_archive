Thread
'''Thread''' can refer to the stuff that holds your clothes together but since that has no [[Internets]], [[Drama]] and/or [[Lulz]], it matters not.

All [[you|YOU]] need to know is that the [[lulz|good]] '''thread''' refers to a post on anything from a [[chan]] image board, to a [[forum]], to a [[YouTube]] video's 'comments' that inspires multiple [[GET|replies]]/[[attention]].

If a '''thread''' is [[Win|WIN!]], fellow posters will add [[image macro]]s as a sign of approval.
