'''Robert Hawkins''' ([[Richard Dawkins|hey]]) went out [[emo|<s>in</s> of style]] in an event dubbed the '''LOLmaha Massacre '07'''. After getting kicked out of his house by his parents,  [[Fucktard|failing the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery Test]], losing [[poor|his job at McDonald's]], breaking up with his [[trap|girlfriend]], and [[Mitchell_Henderson|getting his CD player stolen]], he snapped. Dressed [[in style|in stylish]] Army camo and sporting a freshly styled [[skinhead|military haircut]] he went to the balcony of a shopping mall in [[White people|Omaha, Nebraska]] where he began picking-off employees and customers with an [[Bazooka|AK47]] while the mall piped seasonal favorites such as '''"Jingle Bells"''' to accompany the screams of the dying.

He [[pwn]]ed eight people and wounded five before eviscerating a [[furry|teddy bear]] and then turning the gun on himself for one more confirmed kill. Hawkins died of [[an hero|a self-inflicted gunshot wound]].  Mysteriously, over 50 Jews that worked at the mall stayed home from work that tragic day.  

<s>This was all after announcing his intention to the world in the usual manner, by posting it on [[B|/b/]].</s>  It's a [[Shoop|fake]], retards.

Police [[some argue|aren't sure yet]], but Hawkins is speculated to have [[Mitchell Henderson|lost his iPod]] while [[some argue]] he was just a pissed-off kid who'd spent his life getting ass raped in one foster home or another. He was also being treated for [[ADD]] and [[depression]]. In one of many rambling suicide notes, he told his latest foster mother that [[irony|he didn't want to be a burden on her any more]]. And [[attention whore|now he'd be famous]]. 

Mainly though, Robert Hawkings will be remembered as an [[Epic Fail Guy]] since if he really wanted to  be [[famous]] and go out [[rich and beautiful|in style]], he would have tried to shoot President Bush. Bush himself was in Omaha on Wednesday for a fund-raiser, but left about an hour before the shootings.  Coincidence?  [[You]] decide.

The [[retards|scholars]] at [[B|/b/]] are currently crunching the numbers regarding Hawkins' [[kill ratio]] before awarding him a [[WIN]] or a [[FAIL]] and determining his chart position with other [[FPS]] heroes such as [[The Finnisher]] and [[The Blazn Azn]]. Determining factors include [[pwn|body-count]] to target (aka 'holiday shoppers') ratio, shots fired, and the shooter's available firepower.  Current estimates lean toward FAIL however, as 6 of his 8 victims were [[lemonparty|over the age of 45]] and all were [[Fat|mall-shoppers]].

==Just the facts?==

The shooting was the <s>worst</s> best single day of violence in state history (not counting the various massacres of [[Native Americans|Injuns]] by the US Cavalry [[at least 100 years ago|before 1920]]). 

Hawkins, known as Robbie, was an [[Batshit insane|emotionally troubled]], high school dropout who, according to friends, had lost his job that Wednesday and his girlfriend in the two weeks prior. Hawkins moved in with his friend Will's family last year in the [[Chikins|Quail]] Creek subdivision of Bellevue, according to Will's mother, Debora Maruca. It seems the boys liked to target and [[cum|skeet]]-shoot at her [[incest|family's]] cabin. The night before the shooting, Hawkins and her sons showed her an SKS semiautomatic [[Russia|Russian]] military rifle. At this time it is unconfirmed whether the motive behind the shooting was [[Chris-chan|Mary Lee Walsh breaking his sign]].

In Sarpy County in 2005, Hawkins admitted to a [[drugs|drug]] charge. He also [[Idiot|pleaded guilty]] that year to [[furry|disorderly conduct]] in Washington County and later was arrested for not paying the $100 fine. Hawkins' [[Pedophile|father]], Ronald, had been concerned about his son, said neighbor [[L. Ron Hubbard|John Hubbard]], a captain at the Douglas County Jail. Ronald Hawkins asked Hubbard earlier this year if he would take the youth on a tour of the jail to get him [[rape|"scared straight"]].

Hawkins was a student at Papillion-La Vista High School "off and on," Principal Jim Glover said. Hawkins quit school in March 2006, his senior year. Maruca said he later had gotten his general equivalency degree (GED).

==Happy==
He made about $800 a month working at a nearby McDonald's and had started to pay rent in an effort to become more responsible. He had gotten his driver's license in July, and on Nov. 28 he licensed a [[Retro|1995 green Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo]]. 

==Sad==

He had broken up with his girlfriend [[Last Thursday|in the last two weeks.]] He was also ticketed Nov. 24 on suspicion of [[loli|contributing to the delinquency of a minor]] and two alcohol charges.

"He must have felt like everything he touched turned to [[crap]]," Maruca said. Maruca is a nurse in the recovery room at the Nebraska Medical Center. "I guess he was right, because he turned my weekend to crap with all the wounded fly-over state fatties he blasted the fuck up. What a dick"

== The Rick Murray Connection ==

[[Image:Rickisangry.jpg|thumb|left|Rick Murray of Degrassi: The Next Generation. A hard ass killa. ]]
Many people may feel inclined, and rightly so, to compare Robert Hawkins to a fictional character by the name of Rick Murray from the popular adolescent drama, [[degrassi|Degrassi]]. Both the actor and The Real Boy bases his fame around a prototype of a killa, as is shown through their chosen [[fashion|style of dress]] and cool hair. Badass hair. The fictional character, Rick Murray, attempted to shoot up his school but [[fail|failed]]. Bob Hawkins, after years of studying the mistakes of his contemporary, managed to nab one million Christmas Shoppers. He consequently won the coveted "I shot a bunch of people and all I got was this lousy T-shirt" award of [[Katy|DOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM]]!!!
