Cory Lidle

On 10/11/06, [[Yankees]] pitcher Cory Lidle flew his small plane into a 50-story New York City high-rise.  Following this attack, Yankees manager Joe Torre fled the country, after being placed on the FBI's Most-Wanted list.  Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was later assassinated by a [[Troll|drunken Mets fan]].

This series of attacks led to the Major League War, in which the National League successfully defended itself from the [[Jews|evil Zionists]] of the American League.  It is widely postulated that the main reason for the National League's victory in this war was the inability of American League pitchers to hit a fucking ball because of their [[Stupid|designated hitter]] blasphemy.

==Lidle's Motivation==
Historians still debate the reasons for Cory Lidle's attack to this day.  The most widely accepted reasons are:

*Lidle was ashamed of his team's loss to the [[Assholes|Detroit Tigers]] in the playoffs.
*Steinbrenner, widely-believed to be an [[Jews|evil Zionist pig]], ordered the attack (see [[JEWS DID WTC|Zionist Conspiracy]]).
*-PROOF THAT Jew DID [[JEWS DID WTC|9/11]] AND 10/11  [[Truth|"The airplane struck the floor numbered '''40th''' (actually '''30''' flights of stairs above the street) of the Belaire building at '''524 East 72nd Street.'''"]]  40-30='''10'''  AND  5+2+4='''11''' AND 7+2='''9'''!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dood it has both 10/11 AND 9/11 messages in it. 
*As a pitcher, he was unable to hit the broadside of a building, so he decided to do so as a pilot.
*He was just flying a Lidle low.
*Did it for the [[lulz]].

==Beer Pong Rule==
*Want to confuse and shame your opponents? Throwing the ping pong ball at the force of a crashing plane will knock the other teams cups of off the table, spilling beer on your competitors.
