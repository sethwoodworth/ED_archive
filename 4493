Karl Popper
[[Image:Amsterdam_poppers.jpg|thumb|For some reason, Sir Karl is very popular with the [[gay]] community. Most likely they have him confused with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]].]]
Karl Pooper is best known for the view that all [[scientific]] theories must be composed of "falsifiable" statements. [[Philosopher]]s, who are the only ones who actually know what he meant by this, have long since agreed that he was [[stupid|wrong]]. But the news has not yet reached [[no more than 99|almost any]] of the [[scientist]]s, [[13 year old boy|wannabe scientists]], [[atheist]]s, [[Christian]]s, and other assorted [[fuckwit]]s of [[Internets]]land &mdash; if, that is, they have ever even heard of Popper in the first place. The resulting fog of ignorance results in much [[lulz]]. Example:

:'''Prima''': 1+1=2 is not scientific because it isn't falsifiable.[http://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.singapore/browse_frm/thread/1db4f01f755ddf74]
:'''Secunda''': <strike>According to Popper, 1+1=2 is a tautology and therefore, indeed, not scientific (although certainly true). Also, why the hell was this posted to soc.culture.singapore?</strike> [[Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhh|duh]], if 0=2 then 1+1=0.[http://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.singapore/browse_frm/thread/1db4f01f755ddf74/b2406064a2cf8fcf?]

But the main occasion for dragging Popper's theory through the mud of stupidity comes when someone makes a brilliant [[TL;DR]] post in which they disclose their original discovery that [[Intelligent Design]] is not a scientific theory.[http://genetech.livejournal.com/3265.html][http://brokenhut.livejournal.com/130569.html][http://publius-ovidius.livejournal.com/159727.html][http://imomus.livejournal.com/218482.html?thread=7873394][http://pbrooks.livejournal.com/1292.html] In [http://sqrrl101.livejournal.com/177201.html?thread=1209905 this sterling case] (which also includes a brilliant Chuck Norris joke), the term "falsifiable" is only brought up in [http://sqrrl101.livejournal.com/177201.html?thread=1209905#t1209905 the religious idiot's TL;DR reply]: "If you believe the arguments are so wrong, so falsifiable, so incorrect, put forward your views in a respectful manner." Oops, looks like he has no idea what "falsifiable" means. He does have a big cross on his [[icon]], though.

==Mr. Popper's Politics==

By [[Hitler|the standards of today's American political scene]], Popper was actually relatively left wing. But he was anti-Marxist (because &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; Marxist "science" is not falsifiable), and a scattered few [[leftard]]s who know this have never forgiven him. This, too, can occasionally be [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.politics.socialism.trotsky/msg/45d190b087647df1?dmode=source&hl=en a source of drama].
