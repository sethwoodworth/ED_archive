Rename tokens
'''Rename tokens''' are a way for [[LiveJournal]] to profit from certain users' decisions to change their usernames without having to begin a new journal. It's also useful when you realize that kcchefs is not the name of a sports team, or that douchebag is not spelled dooshbag.  

When a user purchases the rename token, he or she is presented with the option to sever all connections with people on his [[friends list]].  An [[emo]] user might mistakenly believe that this means his new name will remain a secret forever; however, all old comments will change to the new name, rendering his [[fake death|disappearance]] pointless and bringing on the [[lulz]]
