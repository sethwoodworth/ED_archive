'''Afro Ninja''' is an ancient [[internet]] [[meme]] that spawned from a series of [[Television|TV]] [[Advertising|advertisements]] for the [[Video games|vidya game]] Tekken 5.  The ad soon found its way to [[YouTube]] and took the internet by [[Chocolate Rain|storm]].  The meme then got [[Old meme|old]], and people stopped caring and forgot about it, as is the way of things on the internets.  Afro Ninja is considered to be among the ranks of other such old YouTube memes as [[Numa Numa]], [[Star Wars Kid]], [[Chris Crocker]], [[etc]].

==The Story==
The aforementioned Tekken ads ran in early [[2005]] as a sort of teaser to promote the [[PS2]] game prior to its release.  They basically featured what might be considered "[[NORP|normal people]]" (i.e. [[fat]], uncoordinated [[nerd]]s) trying to perform the various super-[[awesome]] martial arts techniques that the [[imaginary]] characters in the game can pull off with ease.  Thus, the commercials were sort of like watching [[shit]]ty actors trying to emulate ''[[America]]'s Funniest Home Videos'' clips.  Nobody's really sure what the ads were supposed to convey; maybe that [[IRL|RL]] will never be as good as the comfort of your pretend videogaming universe - which is completely [[true]].

Anyway, one of the many different ads featured a [[nigra]] with some nunchaku (or "nunchucks," for those of you who aren't [[weeaboos]]), trying to do a back flip.  Of course, he [[fail]]ed to do this, landed on his afro, then jumped up disoriented and fell out of the camera's view while waving his nunchucks around.

Whether the footage used in the videos was filmed for the sole purpose of the Tekken ads or was taken from another source was originally unclear.  [[Some argue|Some liked to claim]] that they were outtakes from the failed auditions to an action movie.  Still, others claimed that it's all [[This looks shooped|fake]].  However, it has recently come to the attention of the internet that the Afro Ninja's video was taken from an audition for a Nike commercial.  No word on the outtakes of the other losers, though.

Once the easily amused masses of the interwebs found the video, they happily embraced it as the next big thing.  Much [[e-fame]], [[internet money]], and [[hookers and blow]] followed for the nigra star of the video.  Although the video eventually [[Death|went the way]] of all [[old memes]], it has gained  a fair bit of attention in recent times.  For instance, Afro Ninja was featured in the now infamous [http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/1204 ''Canada on Strike''] episode of [[South Park]].  Afro Ninja was also featured in the internet-themed {{ytlink|V9Y4BppbBFo|music video}} of alternative rock band Weezer called "[[Cock|Pork]] and [[Balls|Beans]]."  The Afro Ninja would then make one final grab at media attention by appearing on [[Tosh.0]] and reliving his original audition.  Unfortunately, he no longer has an afro :(

One interesting thing to note about the Afro Ninja video is that very few people seem to have any clue where it actually came from, so everyone just assumed it was some stupid black person with a misdirected desire to become a martial artist.  This has led to numerous [[retard]]s making up stories and trying to claim the video as their own finding.  People have even added [[watermark]]s to their uploaded videos, even though each one is the same damn thing.  As expected, [[ebaumsworld]] even got in on the action, [[O RLY|trying to take credit for something that isn't theirs]], a time honored tradition for [[Eric Bauman]].  Think of it as a bunch of [[European]] settlers coming over to colonize the Americas (internet memes) and going, "LOL LOOK WHAT WE FOUND!" and trying to claim everything as their own and [[rape|raping]] the continent with their [[fail]].  That's kind of how this is; except, in this case, it's really not that big of a deal, since this particular video isn't all that special.  I mean, [[you]] can only watch a nigga fall on his head so many times before it stops being funny (850 as of the last count).
