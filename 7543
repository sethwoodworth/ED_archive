SkOt
Once upon a time on the [[internets]] there was a [[thirteen year old boy]] named Sk0t. He lived with his parents and siblings and worshipped at the altar of [[irc]]. 
Sk0t believed very strongly in his ability to [[hack]] just about anything and relished opportunities to show off his mad skilz. One night, while his parents were out, Sk0t and a sibling were stargazing through the light polluted haze of a certain city. His sibling dutifully pointed out that a neighborhood light post was a particular source of teh evil light pollution.

Upon realizing the truth of this unjust situation (and after receiving suitable moral support from his friends on irc) our hero bravely sallied forth to hack the offending post. Thus, Sk0t set about cutting into the base of the unit MacGuyver style, and promptly got [[pwned]] by the mass amounts of current flowing through the live electric cable (note: [[irl]] this is widely regarded as a bad idea). In addition to performing the last full measure of devotion required to win a [[Darwin Award]], Sk0t, in his own small way, helped to further ingrain onto the national consciousness the useful phrase, "the badly charred body(ies) had to be identified through dental records".

Everyone else lived happily ever after. Except for his friends and the sibling who talked him into it. They must be having a rather tough time of it, what with all that soul crushing guilt and all. Oh well.

Here's the link to the irc chat log that contains Sk0t's final profound thoughts on this earth as well as the touching and thoughtful tributes made to him by his friends:

*Note: Scholars of irc chat will recognize such tried and true phrases of "Get pics!" as well as more sobering, deeply emotional passages such as "omg I can't believe he's gone my hands are shaking " and “nite nite sk0t”. Truly the product of the poets of our times. [http://pms.colonpee.com/irc/skot.txt Original Document]

   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Posted 9:55 a.m. August 13, 1999 -- A
   failed attempt at getting a better view of last night's Perseid meteor
   shower cost a Newport Beach man his life. 

   Scott Millet was electrocuted when he tried to cut wires in a street light so
   he could see the spectacle better through a telescope, reported CBS 2 News. 

   The 20-year-old apparently broke into the base of the city light pole and
   "used a tool to cut the main power cord," Newport Beach police Sgt.
   Mike McDermott told news wires. "As a result, he was electrocuted and
   was found to be unresponsive by responding paramedics." 

   It all happened around 1 a.m. outside the victim's home on the 1800
   block of Santiago Drive, said the television station. Millet died at a
   hospital a short time after the accident.

   Electrocution in Newport Beach

   A young man was electrocuted in Newport Beach today when he
   allegedly tried to cut wires in a city light pole to darken the
   street so he could view a meteor shower through a telescope,
   police said. Scott Millett, 20, died at a hospital a short time after
   the 1 AM accident outside his home in the 1800 block of Santiago Drive,
   said Newport Beach police Sgt. Mike McDermott. 

   "He had been viewing a meteor shower through a telescope with
   family members in the street near his residence," McDermott
   said. "He decided that a nearby street light was hindering his
   viewing of the stars and he broke into the base of the city light
   pole, exposing the wiring. 

   "He then used a tool and attempted to cut the main power cord,"
   McDermott said. "As a result, he was electrocuted and was found to
   be unresponsive by responding paramedics."
