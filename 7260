Sauce

Sauce is the term [[4chan]] users have grown accustomed to use instead of the word “source”. It stems originally from a [[wordfilter]] on /b/, but gained popularity because "sauce" is more easily [[masturbation|typed with one hand]] than is “source”. This enables /b/tards to quickly whine for the source of an image while furiously fapping to [[furry]] [[porn]].

Because Moot is a [[weeaboo]] the wordfilter likely originated from [[Otaku|''Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex'' episode 9: "C: The Man Who Dwells in the Shadows of the Net – CHAT! CHAT! CHAT!" (Net no Yami ni Sumu Otoko CHAT! CHAT! CHAT! / ネットの闇に棲む男 CHAT! CHAT! CHAT!)]]. In a virtual-reality chatroom one avatar asks for sources and another mocks them with the phrases "sarce" and "soy sauce".

“Sauce plz” is typically yelled out in [[ALL CAPS]] by [[leech]]ers, usually with a pleading tone and with one or more “[[ZOMG]]”s. The expression requests anything related to the source of the previously posted pictures of [[bestiality]] [[lolikon]], be it a [[Bittorrent|torrent]], a [[website]], a [[Rapidshare|Rapidshit]] link, or the name of the “artist” – as <s>deranged</s> (that's redundant as fuck) [[furry art|furry pornographers]] prefer to be called.

With any luck the user will fulfill the request and may even post [[moar]] pictures. At this point there is usually [[semen]] covering the pores of the right hands of the creeps who were following the thread.

Sauce whining is necessary due to the fact that [[4chan]] addicts are completely incapable of creating [[funny|original]] content. The pictures are seldom created by the [[OP]], unless of course they’re a grotesque mixture of [[schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] [[MS Paint]] scrawling with [[Photoshop]] [[cuntpaste]]ry. The legality issues of a drawing of a furry toddler being raped by a tentacle demon are never discussed.
