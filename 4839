==Early history==

Liberia ("land of freedom"; real original, guys) is a colony of Americanized negroes in [[Africa]] which was founded in the 19th century when a runaway black person called Tyrone-Jenkins-Jamal-Montel III got funding from some [[America|stupid rich white men]] to buy land in [[Africa]]. This was (and still is) known by [[fucktard]]s as "returning to the [[AIDS|motherland]]," as if the fact that the people in Africa are also [[black]] made it a good idea, even though this makes about as much sense as going up to a random man in [[Japan]] and saying "hey, we've both got [[cock]]s; let's be [[BFF]]!!![[one|11]]. Shockingly, these retarded founders found themselves surrounded by totally unrelated breeds of black person who wanted to boil them in [[oil]]. The Liberians, being partly [[white]] due to [[rape]] and thus marginally more intelligent, repeatedly [[pwned]] the natives in many glorious [[victory|victories]] to advance the cause of [[freedom]].

==Claims to Fame==
Liberia's name does actually translate to "Land of the Free" in Latin. As a result, Liberia has been the proud holder of the record for biggest nation-wide irony.

==More recent shenanigans==

Liberia has had 2 civil wars in the past 2 decades, for a total of 11 years of war since 1989, as a result of which they now have many lovely creatures like the one at right, an average life expectancy of 40[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/li.html#People], an 85% unemployment rate[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/li.html#Econ], and a grand total of 5 internet hosts[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/li.html#Comm]. [[Gg]]. Their latest former president Charles Taylor is on trial for 650 counts of war crimes during the latter war, but it could have just been some guy who looked like him.

According to [http://www.fol.org/ these people], Liberia has 800 friends, putting it slightly ahead of [[Jameth]] and [[Weev]]. Retards who think Liberia was a good idea can be found at {{ljcomm|back_to_africa}}.
