Sean
{{merge|711chan}}
==Sean==
Sean is a 15 year old, son of [[jewlion]] who creates every post on [[711chan]]'s /b/ board. Essentially the convenience store version of [[David]]. But unlike David, Sean was never good. Sean emerged after a dispute on irc led to some [[scene]] faggot called Vanilla quitting [[711chan]] [[irc]] forever. The very next day, Sean emerged and began posting on /b/. The popular consensus is that Sean is irl either [[Sean Hannity]], [[Scotland|Sean Connery]] or Vanilla himself. Either way; Sean is a tremendous faggot and should stfu asap. As of February 08, It was widely acknowledged that Sean had been spending far too much time around David, who has become a very negative influence on the once treasured Sean. In order to keep Sean in good shape, Jewlion issued David with a lifetime ban from the 711, but lack of a preemptive strike means that Sean may have already contracted [[aids]] after [[Chanology|an entire spring of anal with David.]]

==Posting Record==
At best, Sean's posting record is erratic. Back when he appeared in 2007, Sean would contribute a few posts of mildly interesting, unoriginal content every day, and maybe raid some emos. Nowadays, he will pop his head in every few months, and scream faggotry until he is [[ddos|forced to leave]] again, due to circumstances relating to his faggotry.

==Shut up Sean==
Back when Sean first appeared, it was correctly noted that he should shut up. So henceforth, Shut up Sean became the first meme of 711chan. This went in every field, and all was good. But with heavy immigration from [[420chan]], [[7chan]], and [[4chan]], this meme was forgotten. With nobody telling Sean to shut up, he ran amok committing [[Chanology|unforgivable acts of faggotry]]. Seeing what had happened, Jewlion tore Seans cock off with his mighty fangs, and wordfiltered Sage to Shut up Sean. The old meme returned, and Sean ceased the [[moralfag|faggotry]]. So remember kids, Shut up Sean goes in every field. 711chan's life may depend on it.


==What's New With Sean==
*'''1'st September 2008''' Sean finally shuts up, meaning no more textfaggotry. He only posts pictures in /b/ now. He doesnt post anything on any other board
