'''Simon Ng''', also known as '''Sek Man''', '''ToTo247''', '''ToTo''', or, more commonly, '''That [[Asian]] [[Xanga]] kid what got [[murder]]ed''', was a [[NYC|Queens]] who joined [[Xanga]] on the 3rd of October in 2002. He was [[pwned|killed]] by some [[dood]] on May 12th, 2005. Around a week after he was pronounced [[dead]], the news got out and spread around the [[Internets]] like some kind of scattering of virtual ashes to the four corners of the Internet. Thousands of people began leaving comments on his Xanga in some sort of attempt at memoriam of Simon, or as a form of [[epic|POSTING ON EPIC THREAD]], only to forget about him a few minutes afterward to go look at some new and upcoming [[meme]].

Yes, murdered! Well, see, this guy, Jin Lin, came up to Simon's apartment in hopes of seeing Simon's sister, Sharon Ng. Oh, and he wanted his fishin' poles back. Sharon wasn't home at the moment, and I suppose his fishin' poles were, so Simon let the creepy ex-boyfriend guy with the stupid glasses stay while he looked for Lin's desired items. He apparently stayed there for at least 2 hours, smoking inside Simon's apartment and walking around in his big ole dirty shoes, probably getting dirt all over the floor Simon washed just TWO DAYS AGO [[OMG]]! I'd get pissed too if some guy dirtied up my floor and then killed me.

So anyways, Lin was just out for Sharon's [[money]] so he could buy himself a trip back to Hong Kong, or maybe just his fishin' poles, or maybe both, but didn't find any money in Sharon's bedroom, so he decided to stab Simon instead, thinking that maybe Simon was actually a cash pinata in disguise. Lin tied Simon up and set upon him with a butcher knife -- lordy knows where he got rope and a butcher knife, though I'm assuming he just keeps some spare rope and various styles of knives in his pocket for safekeeping, or maybe that's a fad with the little Hong Kongian communities down in Queens. Needless to say, luck was not on Lin's side and there was no cash inside poor Simon. This wouldn't stop Lin though, for he was a diehard bastard and wanted another shot at striking it rich. When Sharon came home, Lin sprung from behind the tall reeds and, not unlike a jaguar on crack, slashed Sharon's neck open, hoping for one last chance at finding some spare dinero hidden away in Sharon's jugular vein. No cigar that time either.

Sharon was still alive when her current boyfriend called up, and managed to tell him to get help, but sadly she died an hour after the call was made. A sucky thing, too, because if Lin had chopped her head off entirely she would have been dead for sure, and then she couldn't tell her boyfriend to call 911, and then maybe Lin woulda had some time to clean up and dispose of the bodies. Then nobody would know about the scandal and we wouldn't have ToTo's page showing up in various chain mail and Internet sanctuaries. But nobody really gives a fuck about Sharon's death anyways, seeing as she doesn't have a Xanga and therefore can't be spammed with comments hating or fake-crying for her murder, and therefore is not cool.

Lin was caught, though. Just one unlucky strike after another for that guy.

I wonder how you pronounce Simon's last name? I imagine it would be something along the lines of 'nhhgh' or maybe something akin to 'nig'. Or perhaps it's an abbreviation for some long Asian name like Nihikonamigoolai. Or maybe it's just a simple short Chinese name that happens not to have any vowels in it. Or maybe he was a closet [[Newgrounds]] fan. Either way, Simon was a 19-year-old Asian kid with too much Japanese homework to do and a collection of bizarre [[emoticons]] he liked to put in every post he made on his Xanga. He had an assortment of pictures posted on his Xanga, which all eerily do not display. The only pictures that work are a picture of his prized Sony NW-HD1 and a picture of five half-sober dudes, one of which being Simon's friend from the US, but it's not confirmed if Simon is in the picture too.

== Simon's Site Today ==
[[Image:Simong_Ng_Lastpost.jpg|thumb|900px|Simon Ng's Lastpost (click to enlarge)]]
Simon's site never used to get many visitors, besides a couple of his friends commenting on a post or something like that. After Simon's death, his site got thousands of hits, his Xanga registering over 4,000 comments, the most on his last post on the site, others scattered around later posts by dumbasses who think they're smarter than everyone else for posting on some secluded area of Simon's Xanga, like they care more or something.

There have also been flame wars erupting on Simon's first post, in comments, because some dumbasses think they're being cool by soiling Simon's name on his Xanga. Then they get yelled at via comments on Simon's site, at which point they leave to [[troll]] other Xangas, and everybody ends up looking like a [[fucktard]].

Simon's site currently ranks the 6th highest visited site in the history of Xanga sites.

== Other Information ==
Simon's parents probably are living in misery now, because they learned that they should have never left their son and daughter in some apartment in Queens while they bopped around Hong Kong. Also, we should all know by now that when a creepy stalker guy with weird glasses comes to your house, you should give him the fishin' poles, give him any spare cash you have, and push him out of the door before he can reach for the variety of knives in his pocket. And never leave said creepy guy downstairs while you take the time to post on your retarded Xanga. That's just rude.
