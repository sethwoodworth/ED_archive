Cell Phone
{{work|moar Internets relevance}}

Ever wished you could take [[drama]] wherever you go? Do you need a constant supply of [[Internets]]? Are you afraid to leave the house because you might miss an [[instant messaging|instant message]]? Do you have a loud, irritating voice? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you need a fucking cell phone. Cell phones are a great way to make [[prank call|prank calls]] or other illegal stuff because you can always shove it in your [[ass]] if the police finds you. 

==Need to know==
Before you go out and get one, you're going to have to learn a few things. For starters make a tinfoil hat to protect yourself from the microwaves that cell phones produce. Never take it off! If it rings and you forget the hat, your brain will boil and run out of your tear ducts. The hat will also protect you from other people's cell radiation. Second hand radiation is the third leading cause of [[otakukin]]; the first being bad video games.
Next, you need to buy more [[gay]] [[crap]] for your phone than you can actually fit on it. This is because you're going to drop your phone a lot, and will need spare parts. Also, get one of those bluetooth wireless headset things, so you can expedite your transformation into a cellborg.

Once you've got a cell, learn to field strip it as fast as possible. If it jams in the middle of [[drama]], you'll need to disassemble it and fix the problem as fast as possible.

Remember! if you are a resident of [[America]] you may be able to extend your mobile phones antenna and generate [[lulz]] by sneaking up on [[camwhores]] and sticking it up his/her arse while she/he is in a live webcam chat with [[emofags]]. Doing this to a male [[camwhore]] will cause all the male [[emofags]] who are watching the video feed will instantly explode as the sexual tension is too much.

'''D'''eath by '''H'''aving '''C'''ell '''P'''hone is becoming more and more common. No one knows why people yelling into cell phones are randomly shot, but an investment in a bullet proof vest may not be a bad addition to one's cellular equipment. It seems as though when a cell phone is purchased by a business major or other arrogant bastard, a special number known as an IP is assigned to them. The IP contains the GPS address and future time of death of the buyer, encrypted in some form of number hash. This enables [[LJ killers]] to find them and execute them at a specific time and date.

==[[Emo]] Cam==
A recent innovation in cell phone technology, the camera phone is exactly what it says it is. Camera phones are responsible for the dramatic increase in [[internet disease]], [[high contrast]], and [[fat girl angle shot]]s. An additional feature of the camera phone is its notoriously bad picture quality. It is physically impossible to take a [[great]] picture with a camera phone. Consequently, [[emo]] kids everywhere use camera phones to spread internet disease.

Despite their features, camera phones can be used to create some [[lulz]]. Having a camera handy at all times allows one to do some hefty [[IRL]] [[trolling]]. However...

==Changing Room Cam==

Changing room + mobile phone camera/video recorder = much lulz. 

As a consequence, many changerooms ban the use of such recorders because of lameass reasons such as "privacy".
However, many phones are small enough to be smuggled in hidden in an ass. Once inside: lights, camera, action.
Just don't get caught.

==Selecting A Proper Cell Phone==

Chances are, no one wanted to talk to you before you decided to get a cell phone, and now, thanks to the glorious age we live in, you can now sign a contract and pay a monthly fee to be reminded of this. Ergo, make sure you select a feature rich phone, so you'll have something to pass the time while not getting calls. Remember, modern cell phones don't just do one thing well (like...making a fucking phone call), they do allot of things really, really, really shitty, and all at once (MP3 player, Digital Camera, Video Games, Internet Browser, etc)

==Bluetooth==
Having a bluetooth connection allows [[girlvinyl]] to [[troll]] someone [[IRL]] in various ways:

* '''Bluesnarfing:''' Refers to permanently borrowing information from a phone. Be it phone numbers, [[n00dz]], or [[internet disease]].

* '''Bluebugging:''' When the government tries to find out whether you're talking to terrorists. [[Oh noes]]! Also, when terrorists hack phones to make long distance calls to the [[Iraq|-istans]]. Oh [[shit]]!

* '''Bluejacking:''' When the phone is completely [[pwned]].

===MySpace Phone===
If you can't piss enough people off with your regular cell phone, maybe it's time to get a [[MySpace]] phone. Or MyPhone. Whatever. Promises all the idiot user customization, maybe half the speed, and some of the portability of MySpace. If you're retarded and don't get our meaning, it's fucking useless. Or at least it will be.
