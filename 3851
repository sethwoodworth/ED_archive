'''''iCarly''''' [[Fact|is the worst show on television]]. This steaming pile of shit revolves around the miserable fuck lives of two [[12 year old girls|13 year old]] [[Loli|lolis]] who [[Camwhore|run their own web show]]. The show was created as [[Viacom]]'s next attempted at cashing out [[jailbait|another child actor]] ever since Jamie Lynn Spears failed to realize that [[blowjob|her mouth can't get pregnant]]. 

The show came to be when well-known drama whore Miranda Cosgrove realized that she could get her own show using her [[buttsecks|special talents]] to persuade Viacom producers. Ever since, "iCarly" has become the most popular shows for [[12 year old girls]], and [[desperate]] [[pedophiles]].  

==The Show==

[[Image:SamChangin.gif|thumbnail|Rated G, yo!]]

[[Image:Freenudes.jpg|thumbnail|For a 13 year old [[camwhore]] she's very creative when it comes to marketing. And just like any other advertisement it is just a trap to get the [[asperger]]'s to their show]]
The show is based around the life of Carly [[Shay]], your average American [[whore|teenage girl]]. One day, Carly was in the teachers' lounge sucking her teachers' dicks for good grades when she saw that her teacher had pulled out a video camera. This gave the little whore an idea: "Why be a regular whore when I can also be a camwhore as well?" Teaming up with her best friend and well-known dyke Sam Puckett, Carly set out to become the most popular camwhore on the Internet.

Each episode of the show consists of Carly preparing for her next episode of "iCarly." In the process, she ends up getting into wacky situations including:
* How can you let my enemy [[Buttsex|penetrate my inner sanctum?!]]
* Getting detention for prostitution.
* Breaking into teachers' houses [[for the lulz|for various reasons.]]
* Making fun of various citizens.
* [[Script kiddies|Hacking into their middle school's computer network.]]
* Having a Super [[butthurt]] Haxor [[Trying too hard|hack into their website so that he could get sympathy sex]].
* Gang-rape a private school dean for the [[Its a trap|ball in her pocket]].
* Having an orgasm every time they eat [[vagina|creamy pie]]. 
* Teaming up with [[Fred]] to create mass [[drama]] when it was actually a [[hoax]] to get more page-views for their sites.
* Note that they can NOT do the show without [[capslock|YELLING AND OVER REACTING! YOU MUST YELL AND ACT LIKE AN IDIOT!!!!1]]
* Sending various adult figures who can stop Carly from doing her show to their doom. 

After they've planned their show, they then air their creation live to viewers across the interwebs on their flashy awesome php-built website because [[bullshit|Washington State funds a great web page course for middle school students]].

The web broadcast consists of using weird [[sex toys|props and gags]] to create a sense of funny but it usually ends in the creation of a blast of concentrated anti-lulz. When Sam and Carly aren't having three-ways, four-ways, and five-ways with [[gay|hot]] men and [[whores|beautiful women]] of all ages, showing clips of Carly secretly masturbating in public or showing people how to use sex toys, they're airing a video submitted by their fans. Most of these videos consist of "Who Can Shove What Up Where," [[Goatse]] imitations, and clips from the [[Shock Site|Pain Olympics]].

Considering that no mentally sane person would laugh at any of the "jokes," the show must recycle the same fucking laugh track and cheering sound effects of a castrated elephant. As if the jokes aren't bad enough, the fact that the producers think they're SO FUCKING FUNNY and the overused laugh tracks will make you want to [[an hero|commit suicide]], as you should you pedophillic sack of crap. What the fuck are you doing watching Nickelodeon anyway?  Also, why was this article created?

==Characters==
*'''[[slut|Carly]]''' - When it comes to lolis, the best type is the sluttiest, and it doesn't get sluttier than Carly Shay. Like many other [[slut|girls]] her age, her main drive in life is to have the most attention ever. Unlike most of the gabbling whores of today's generation, [[Bullshit|she has a brain]]. She's one of those spoiled little shits that always gets what she wants and [[butthurt|if she doesn't]], she always [[blowjob|finds]] [[secks|a]] [[buttsecks|way.]] When she can't get it, she gets her slave to [[buttsecks|persuade]] the opposing parties. This is one teenage girl you do NOT want to <s>mess</s> fuck with, literally. She also [[slut|appeared in a bikini in one episode]] for [[sick fucks|normal people]] to [[fap]] to while riding their unicorns.  You can see the actress on TV singing the praises of golden showers in the song "[[Piss|It's Raining Sunshine]]".  You can legally fap to this one on May 14, 2011, though we know you do already.

*'''Sam''' - Sam is the second of the two loose gals on ''iCarly'' and the local neighbourhood dyke. Famous for her role as Stephanie Tanner, her main role in the show is to rape the living shit out of everything that moves with her massive, raping dildo. One of her most notable targets is Freddie. Whenever she's not penetrating an innocent bystander, she's filming a new web cast with her Mistress Carly. She provides the [[sick fuck|comical]] element to the show. Most /b/tards hail her as the prime example of the average female on /b/. This theory is false because [[Rules of the Internet|there are no girls on the internet]]. She had [[retard|writing on her stomach]] in one episode, clearly displaying her readiness for /b/.  The [[jailbait]] wait for this one ended on June 26, 2010, so fap away.
 
*'''[[moot|Freddie]]''' - The camera guy for the show. He is super leet with his [[Computer Science III|Computer Science]] education, and he's only 13. He got tricked into becoming the camera guy for "iCarly" when Carly pulled the classic [[Friend Zone]] trap which Freddie couldn't resist--the little pussy. Freddie is the only person that Carly won't fuck, suck, or even plop em' out for and he still does her bidding. Whenever he isn't crying in the corner jerking off to [[MCR]], he's being constantly raped by Sam, and when it's not Sam, it's his bitch of a mother who was last seen on [[Crap|Malcolm in the Middle]]. He probably enjoys it seeing that he kissed Sam which simultaneously made fat girls squeal, [[pedophiles]] [[fap]], and made innocent channel surfers who were just looking for the Packers game puke shit [[Zalgo]] fashion. In one episode, he wears a [[fursuit]] to "[[Yiff|make his baby sister laugh]]" but got [[GTFO|vomited]] on when his little sister (who was only shown in that episode and is [[rape|never seen again]]) figured out he was a fucking [[furry]]. In the following episodes, he strangely never uses the fursuit again, despite how expensive it probably was, but he [[closet furry|has his reasons.]] He would later go on to build an [[4chan|imageboard]].

*'''[[Pedophile|Spencer]]''' - The older "brother" of Carly. In reality, he is a pedophile posing as Carly's brother. It all began when he was hiding in a dumpster waiting for a sweet little girl to walk by when he noticed Carly walking with the real Spencer. When Carly got distracted by a possible [[Prostitot|"business opportunity"]], she left the real Spencer to wait near the dumpster. Later that night, the sick fuck of a pedophile--we'll call him Mitch Conner--had now disguised himself as Spencer waiting for the right opportunity. Not only is he able to hide his pedo ways, he landed in a pedo goldmine. He is considered a hero to most. He will also be voicing the main character for [[furry|Tuff Puppy.]] 

*'''[[Basement Dweller|Nevel]]''' - The show's [[Retard|smart guy]]. Apparently, this nerd decides what websites are "kool or nawt." When Carly found a loophole in his bullshitty plothole, Nevel gained a 5-foot boner then [[not gay|torments]] Carly on the later episodes.

==Fandom==
''iCarly'' fans can be considered the most pathetic people on the Internet. They lack the ability to congregate even into the simplest forum and have the brain capacity of an average Arby's customer, making them dumber than the average [[/b/tard]]. iCarly fans can be summed up in two main categories:

===Seddie ===
[[Image:Sam-and-Freddiedointhenastay.jpg|thumbnail|What Seddie fans fap to.]]
These group of fans can be compared to Zutara fans of "Avatar" in which they're demanding that the producers have Sam and Freddie get together and fuck like it's the end of time. One theory is that Seddie fanatics are actually Zutarafags who are still baawing over the ending to "Avatar."

===Desperate Pedophiles===
The pedophiles that watch "iCarly" are incredibly pathetic. These are the guys who can't even get a simple nude pic, let alone get a little girl to eat their candy. A lot of these pedophiles are actually trying to study the actions of Spencer in order to use his actions on the pedophile front line.    

===Trolling methods===
Trolling an "iCarly" fan is as easy as paying [[Rootbrian]]'s dental bill <s>for the rest of his life</s> [[ALL CAPS|AT ALL]]. It is nearly impossible due to the fact that none of the fans have the mental capacity to create a decent working forum for trolls to do their handy work. Most attempts at trolling "iCarly" fans end in tragedy.

When you do have the ideal opportunity to troll a fan, your best bet is to:
*State that Sam and Freddie will never be together.
*Tell the forum owner that he/she/it is a [[sick fuck|sick]] pedophile.
*Mention how each time someone makes a poor review on iCarly all she wants to do is cry and cut herself.

==Shameless Advertising==

''iCarly'' has become so popular by every little shit in the world that Viacom has seen fit to sell every known type of product under the ''iCarly'' brand name. These include:
*''iCarly'' porno DVDs 
*''iCarly'' music tapes
*''iCarly'' sports drink (with steroid extract)
*''iCarly'' dildo (now it glows in your tight anus)
*''iCarly'' fleshlight
*''iCarly'' blowup doll (now with Freddie)
*''iCarly'' lead-based toys

The producers even saw it fit to tweak the names of IRL products so they wouldn't have to pay for licensing contracts. For example: Pepsi Cola changes to Peppi Cola, iPod becomes PearPod and [[Shamwow]] to [[rape|Shampow]]. 

==="Singing Deals"===
And when you thought that was it the stupid cunt of an actor, Miranda Cosgrove, decided to start a singing career after recording the shitstorm of an opening theme. 

{{quote|It was horrible. Her harpy shriek echoed across the building. It made the Men's Bathroom become haunted with Holocaust victims. It's sad really, because the producers listened to it as if it was heavenly. But really, she writes songs like she takes shits. She shits in the mouth of one of her man whores who then shits it out of his wide open rectum, producing a much denser turd that has properties of highly corrosive acid. Also, they don't flush.|Petey, the Head Janitor at the Recording Studio.}}
