'''Shii''' (known as '''Ashibaka''' until 2003) is the best administrator on [[Wikipedia]].

He remembers [[b/|/b/]] [[nevar|back when /b/ was good]]. He was the one who cracked [[cracky-chan]]'s [[tripcode]] through a dictionary check, founded The Overchan and became gay for [[Jimbo]]. Little is known about his rise from [[b|/b/tard]] [[Shota]] to TOW admin, but one imagines... things that usually happen on [[raep|Law & Order:SVU]].

==Forced Anonymous==
Shii (only one letter away from [[Shit]]) foresaw the cancer that would one day kill /b/ by seeing the same cancer on other forums, so he convinced moot in 2005 to make /b/ Forced Anonymous with [http://wakaba.c3.cx/shii/ this essay].

In 2007, after a newfag sent a 10-page email to moot where he pretended to be an oldfag, moot was convinced that removing forced anonymous would cure the cancer. It didn't work, and in fact made the cancer worse, even introducing new cancers like [[lulz|moot impersonation]]: type Alt+173 in the name field and put <code>mοοt !Εр8рui8Vw2 ＃# Αdmіn</code> in subject field and you can now impersonate moot.

==Shii and [[ED]]==
<i>See also: [[Wikipedia Articles for deletion/Encyclopedia Dramatica]]</i>
[[Image:TOW_bias.png|center]]

After a March 2008 request for an [[arbchat]] on [[get on IRC fgt|#ed]], a bargain was struck, leading to Shii's [[FAIL|one-man]] campaign to get [[User:Shii/Encyclopedia_Dramatica|ED's article back on TOW]] in exchange for having this article removed from ED. The resulting user subpage first draft of the article was immediately nominated for deletion as TOW's [[sceptre]] proclaimed: 

{{quote|<i>'''The article on Encyclopedia Dramatica will not be recreated. Ever.'''</i>|[[Sceptre]]}}

Since he tried to have the ED article recreated, people have begun to think that he might actually be a [[pretty cool guy|pretty cool guy.]] Eh likes to butthurt other [[Wikipedophiles]] and [[pretty cool guy|doesn't afraid of anything.]]

==Shii on [[old memes]] and Wikipedia==
Shii successfully [[Bel-Air]]s [[Jimbo Wales]] and the [[Arbitration Committee]]: 
<blockquote>''It all started when [[Wikipedia:User:Paroxysm|Paroxysm]] decided we needed a [[userbox]] for [[pedophile]]s. MarkSweep decided that was way too obvious trolling, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and asked him on his userpage whether it was trolling. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Paroxysm&diff=prev&oldid=38262183] Since he said it wasn't, I [[AGF|assumed good faith]] and [[VFD|voted to keep]] it in MarkSweep's ensuing TfD. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_5&diff=prev&oldid=38272084] An unnecessary [[Serious|wheel war]] then began, which I was involved in because I wanted people to be able to see what they were voting on and know that it wasn't an attack template. In retrospect it wasn't a big deal and [[bullshit|probably unnecessary]], but without any firm policy for me to follow, I felt process was important here. I asked [[David Gerard|David]] and others to stop wheel warring so that the TfD could continue peacefully but they didn't respond. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_5&diff=prev&oldid=38379229] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:User_paedophile&diff=prev&oldid=38382338] (It's been pointed out to me that it takes two to wheel war, and I'm sorry about that.) Meanwhile, Paroxysm took manners into his own hands and boldly made a new template while I was watching the [[Football|Super Bowl]]. I attempted to keep this visible to users as well, and [[Jimbo Wales]] [[Bel-Air|got scared and said "you're moving with your aunt and uncle in Bel-Air".  I whistled for a cab, and when it came near, the license plate said "fresh" and it had dice in the mirror]].[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&diff=prev&oldid=38386990] [[Bel-Air|If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought "Nah forget it, yo home to Bel Air!"

:<blockquote>So you were sitting in [[ArbCom]] posting suggested remedies to the workshop. Meanwhile all the other cases are closing. All of a sudden the phone rings and it's [[User:David Boothroyd/David Boothroyd|Sam Blacketer]]. He says "This ArbCom is irrelevant to today's Wikipedia and I am going to dismiss it."
