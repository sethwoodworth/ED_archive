'''Weed''' (or '''cannabis''') was invented simultaneously by every religion's [[god]] [[at least 100 years ago]] in 1969 on the planet [[Mexico]] and legalized [[Last Thursday]] in 1982 when [[Hitler]] lost the cold war. [[Hippies|Some people]] say that [[God]] made it.  [[Conservatives|Others ]]will disagree and say that [[Satan]] did, but everybody knows that actually it was invented in [[Colombia]], because every single Colombian is an expert on the manufacture of every illegal drug.  Afghanistan is now in friendly competition with Colombia, producing 90% of the world's opium and a large percentage of the world's weed. Statistics say that 85% of people die the first time using it, but 100% of survivors report having an all-round more kickass life.

Prior to the 1960s, cannabis use was mainly confined to [[Jesus]] and the guy who wrote Lord of the Rings. This all changed when Jerry Garcia invented the [[hippy|dirty hippy]] by forgetting to take a shower one day, thus increasing cannabis consumption dramatically across the US. However, it was still difficult to acquire at this time because [[The Beatles]] and The Dead were using most of it to help them write songs about [[lolrus|walruses]] and glass onions. Thankfully, The Beatles broke up in 1970, allowing the [http://www.triplestarnews.com/images/the_memo/bonedog/reefer/grass.html rest of the world to enjoy it] as well. Soon, it was cheap enough that even [[black people]] could afford it. So they started filling empty cigars with doodoo weed and called it [[blunt]]s or "coon doobie".

Today, it is used by a wide variety of people, except [[rednecks]] (who prefer cheap [[beer]], [[meth]] and dick sucking), [[Heath Ledger]] (who is [[death|dead]]), and [[old people]] (who are already way stoned on prescription meds). Because of the simultaneous existence of [[Snoop Dogg]], Willie Nelson, and [[Bill Clinton]], many feared a shortage would arise, but thankfully [[Mexico]] stepped up to the plate [[last Thursday]] and increased production of [[13 year old boys]], who are known to grow weed in their closets (so their parents don't find out).

==You're too [[obvious]]==

Cannabis is referred to using many slang terms, such as:
* Marijuana
* MJ
* Weed
* Pot
* Ganja
* Ganj 
* Bhang
* That Ish
* [[Ralph Nader|Voting third party]]
* "I go to the high school football games, but I don't give a shit who wins."
* "No, [[mom]], I'm not going to go get ''high''"
* "That's [[not]] mine"
* "Just playing [[video games]] at _____'s house"
* "OH SHIT THE [[Cop|COPS]]... No, wait, it's cool"
* "These are my cousin's pants!"
* "Everyone does it anyways"
* "I know I don't usually drink a two liter of grape soda in one sitting, but I swear I'm just [[Cottonmouth|REALLY thirsty]]"
*  Pokin' Smot
*  Headies
*  "I know its a lot of food mom, but um like i havent eaten in a while"
*  Buddah
*  Hey do you guyz have ne more pawt, i'm drie man

'''NB:''' It's believed that nobody has ever died from using marijuana. That means ''[[An hero|you could be the first]]!''

==[[DO IT FAGGOT]]==

<s>[[User:Flaming-biscuit|Some people]]</s> [[Pussy|Pussies]] claim to be allergic to it, so, in theory, they could die from it. Even though it's generally accepted that no one ever has in the 2,000+ years of cannabis use by humans. They could die. Seriously. Or suffer extreme brain damage.

Marijuana has been proven to fight [[cancer|brain cancer]] and [[lie|increase the smoker's I.Q. by stimulating new brain cell growth]], but as a side effect also causes [[schizophrenia]] and sometimes [[fat|obesity]]. It's up to [[your mom]] to decide whether that's a fair trade-off. And, smoking in the parking lot out side of court, well, li'l mister. That'll get you higher than the airport.
♠
Some people claim to take cannabis but "[[Bill Clinton|don't inhale]]". There is a [[99.9%]] chance that anyone who says this is full of shit.

Smoke Yourself to Sleep

"I've found the best thing to get me asleep is cannabis—and all the people I know who smoke it agree.' - [[Anonymous]]}}

Note: Once sold by white people, weed is now almost exclusively sold by nigras to other nigras and white people too unfortunate to know a mexican to buy from.  Nigras do this solely for the lulz, as they already subsist on welfare checks.  Any nigra telling you he sells for the money is trolling you like hell and should be shot imediatley to prevent [[rape|surprise sex]]. Also note that most niggers like to sell "first time whiteboy weed smokers" oregano. So watch out. If it smells like the shit your dad puts on salad and pizza, than it's bullshit. In short, don't buy from niggers, EVAR. --> Actually oregano is not that bad: drug dealers cut with everything from insecticide to baking soda.

==Stoner threads on /b/==
Lately there has been a new [[shitstorm]] of threads ruining [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|our beloved]] /b/ - the [[420chan|stoner threads]]. There are a fuckload of them popping up everywhere and they are quite popular, even though [[oldfags|many]] think they are retarded. The threads themselves consist mainly of comics, [http://www.fap-roulette.com/2010/01/hot-girls-420-godlike-internet-win.html Girls Gettin' High] and image macros [[Advice Dog/Variations|(stonerdog)]] of situations associated to the consumption of marijuana or other [[drugs]]. Many of said images are completely fucked up and futile and could clearly only have been made by someone who has melted his brain with weed.
