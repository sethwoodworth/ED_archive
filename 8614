{{quote|I just killed two cops. Goodbye.|Tyler Dumstorf}}

On June 19th 2007, [[an hero]] was born. His name was '''Tyler Dumstorf''', a Floyd Central High School honors student and convicted [[Marijuana|pot head]] who liked mind-blowingly [[rap|shit]]ty music. He was [[Fresh_prince|arguing with his mom]] about the [[HTS-Noob|highlighter in his ass]] and after [[Buttsecks|analyzing]] her for several hours, she called the police to give him a nice sit-down talking to. Frightened by the possibility of having all his weed taken away and smoked by a bunch of black persons in the [[police]] department, Tyler loaded his dads' long and sturdy [[Cock|M1 Garand]] whilst distracting the visitors with donuts and handjobs. He then shot both cops in the back, because he was [[13 year old boy|an Sniper]]: [[Lol|One was totally pwned]], the other [[Fail|seriously wounded]]. Tyler then logged onto [[MySpace]], posted, [[I told u i was hardcore|"I just killed two cops. Goodbye."]] and became [[An hero]] of epic proportions. On his MySpace people are too [[retard]]ed to realize dead people can't see the messages they leave. On a [[lulz]]y note, Tyler has received [[moar]] comments dead than alive. 

[[4chan]] was immediately informed and his MySpace was posted, with [[trolling|predictable results]].

=='Tis a loser==
Tyler's MySpace adds [[lulz]] to the equation for many reasons:

1. His last comment before he [[pwned]] [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|two po-pos]] was "you faggit stoner", left by some [[AZN]].

2. His profile is absent of any comment of a [[Woman|female]].

3. He has 1 friend of the [[whore|female]], and she may really be [[Hitler]]. 

4. He's aggressive.

==POT?!?!==

In the aftermath of such stupidity, it is clear that these events never had to transpire if this terrorist/hippie/dipshit had been properly punished for smoking marijuana, by giving him [[hookers and blow]] instead.

==Prevention==

[[white people|Stupid hicks]] often become violent and erratic when police are involved. That's because every person who has upstanding morals is also related to a [[dick|police officer]], [[fag enabler|soldier]], or [[duckroll|firefighter]] and therefore must prove how large their man-handle truly is.

What have we learned?

[[shit nobody cares about|Killing police officers in a pot induced rage is what's in. All the cool kids are doing it. This is exploitable because the police are only trained in distributing violent beatings to innocent citizens, rather than serving the greater good, or thinking. If confronted, these people often hide behind the bible, Bill Hicks, patriotism, and circular logic. Because the police are fucking heroes and only evil terrorists hate the police. Now c'mon, y'all! Let's go lynch us some queers!]]

==MySpace==

In addition, a "memorial MySpace" was created by a [[4chan]] user who sent friend requests to Tyler's IRL friends, adding to the lulz. It used to be [http://www.myspace.com/tyler_dumstorf here]. But [[the man]] at [[MySpace]] removed it because it created far too much [[lulz]].

Upon receiving a friend request, one of Tyler's friends replied with this:

IVE BEEN TRYING TO LISTEN TO THE NEWS AND FILTER OUT THE PARTS THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE. THE MEDIA CAN TEAR A PERSON APART SO QUICKLY. RUMOR HAS IT AND I'M NOT SURE IF ITS TRUE. BUT THAT TYLER HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH HIS PARENTS AND THEIR ADDICTION TO DRINKING. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT HIS MOTHER BUT I HEARD HIS DAD HAD A DRINKING PROBLEM. I WISHED WITH ALL I HAVE THAT I COULD HAD KNOWN, THAT I COULD HAD TALKED TO TYLER. THAT I COULD HAD LET HIM KNOW LIFE COULD BE SO MUCH WORSE.
MY LIFE HASN'T BEEN EASY AND I KNOW I COULD HAVE SAVED HIS LIFE, IF HE ONLY KNEW HOW BAD IT REALLY COULD BE.
MY MOTHER HAS BEEN MARRIED 5 TIMES, I DON'T KNOW MY REAL DAD, MY MOTHER IS A DRUG ADDICT (METH AND CRACK) SHES A HEAVY DRINKER AND MY RECENTLY DIVORCED STEP FATHER IS A VERY HEAVY DRINKER AS WELL. I AM A SINGLE MOTHER OF A LOVELY SON I AM TRYING TO RAISE HIM TO LOVE HIS GRANDPARENTS BUT ITS SO HARD.
I WOULD GIVE SO MUCH TO REACH OUT TO TYLER AS I WOULD REACH OUT TO MY SON IN NEED.
\I AM SO SORRY FOR HIM...
I AM SO SORRY HE HAD TO MAKE SUCH A GROWN-UP DECISION AT SUCH A DELICATE AGE...
HE HAD SO MUCH LIFE TO LIVE....... I WILL PRAY FOR HIM... I HOPE NOW.... HE HAS FOUND THE PEACE HIS HEART HAS YEARNED FOR....]]|[[Anonymous]] Woman??|"Ich liebe [[Cock|dick]]."|Tyler's best 'friend'}}|color=white}}

==A collection of subject related, though totally fucking lame jokes==
* How many people did Tyler's father kill?
-1, he shot (and killed) the Sheriff but he did not kill the Deputy.
* What ammunition was Tyler using (it penetrated bulletproof vests)
-M1 Garands are chambered in .30-06 Springfield, and any loading in that caliber (and pretty much any rifle caliber) can penetrate soft body armor with ease.
*\ Why didn't Tyler's father teach him the first rule of a sharpshooter: Never point a gun or discharge it at any other living being? Exceptions come to [[furries]], [[emos]], [[fags]], [[hippies]], [[communists]], [[niggers]], ragheads, gookers, gingers, [[vtech]] students, [[your mom]], [[Paris Hilton]] and [[Jews]] in general since they were all [[asking for it]].
-[[I did it for the lulz|For the lulz]].
* Did anyone attempt a [[barrel roll]]?
-Obviously not since both men were shot
* Was he a NWA fan?
* Was it possible that someone [[360 Kid|beat his Gears of War score]] seconds/minutes/hours/[[at_least_100_years_ago|100 years]] before the incident?
-It is known that he began playing GoW with a fellow classmate fairly close to his death, possible link?
* Were video games to blame?! (What [[an hero]] incident would be complete without blaming video games?)
* What did [[Jack Thompson]] say?
* Which of Tyler's friends will finish the job and take care of the [[Fail|seriously wounded]] cop?
* [[I_did_it_for_the_lulz|Was it done for the lulz?]] And if not, was it at least done [[for great justice]]?
* [[Jews did WTC|Who did WTC]]?
*Were any tits shown before he [[GTFO]]?
*[[Who was phone|WHO WAS ANONYMOUS WOMAN]]?!1/11!?
