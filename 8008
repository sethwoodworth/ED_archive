Tails Doll
{{crap}}

{{Forced Meme}}

BEHOLD THE UNHOLY MISTAKE OF THE HEAVENS

==The Original==

The Tails Doll is nothing more than a mediocre character from the [[Vidya]] game [[Sonic the Hedgehog|Sonic R.]] To describe the Tails Doll, He's just a [[dildo|dumb toy]] with a robot skeleton. As for his appearance in [[The Game|Sonic R]], the character has the worst speed & the worst turning, [[Fail|just like Sonic himself]]. He's basically just a Sonic clone. Trust me, I've played the game before.

==How It Came To Be==

Apparently, some retarded [[Trollface|troll]] thought he was being funny scaring [[13-year-old boys|little kids]] by turning the Tails Doll into a [[Forced Meme|meme]]. Later, this phenomenon attracted many [[Furries|furries]] and [[Spax3|Sonic fanboys]] on [[YouTube|YouTube]], [[DeviantART|DeviantART]], and many other interwebs.

===The Curse===

The same dude that made the meme also made a ridiculous curse about the character. People say to beat the game [[At least 100|100%]] and the Tails doll will [[Lie|come out of your TV and kill you]]. Another version of the curse requires you to [[Rape|tag]] Super Sonic [[Over 9000|four]] Times to bring about the same thing. There are many [[Bullshit|curses]], but these ones are just quite simply [[Gay|fake]]. Just as fake as [[Trolls|Chainletters]]. Hell, some idiot actually created an account on YouTube called BloodyTailsDoll, claiming that [[lolwut|he was the real Tails Doll]], which is fucking impossible since Tails Doll isn't real.

===The Haters===

As for the [[Your Mom|sane Sonic fans]], they try to convince people that [[Truth|the curse isn't real]]. Instead, they get [[Butthurt|butthurt]] and post hateful comments and videos in response. We still, today, attempt to explain them the truth, that Tails Doll is nothing but a [[DO NOT WANT|stupid scam]]. They still continue to spread [[Shit|drama]] all over our internets. But the haters have made videos proving the Tails Doll is fake and gay.

===Explanation===

I'm pretty sure that if the curse was [[The Cake Is A Lie|real]], nobody would fucking [[Money|buy Sonic R]] because they would be scared to death just because of one character. As a matter of fact, if the curse was real, Sega would be sued by now, as to where people would get butthurt about [[You|innocent little kids]] dying from a character from a [[Retard|retarded]] video game.[[File:30204 1177784042 small.png|right|thumb|250px|[[GAME OVER YEAHHHH]]]]

===Fun Fact===
