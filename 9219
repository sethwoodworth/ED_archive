[http://www.xxxchurch.com/ xxxchurch.com] is the self declared "#1 Christian Porn Site", despite the distinct lack of any ''real'' christian porn (and besides, everyone knows that true followers of Christ masturbate to [[Mel Gibson]]'s "[[Guro|The Passion]]").  

In fact the title of the website and teh promise of christian porn are just a way of luring you to their site, which is in fact, home to an anti-porn group run by pussy hating reverend, Craig Gross.

The website should be of particular lulz value to [[trolls]], due to the 24 hour live support, offering round the clock support to anyone who has a problem with pornography ("my dial-up modem is not not fast enough" and "how long do i nuke hard drive" being the most common questions asked). 

The [http://xxxchurch.com/gethelp/teens/ forums] are a rich and untapped vein of lulz also, which are mostly comprised of guit-ridden god fearing teens and Christian wives worried for the souls of their [[wank|onanistic]] partners.

According to the site, [[LOL WUT|Ron Jeremy is The Devil incarnate]]. In reality, they are just jealous of the fact that a man so fat, ugly, hairy and sweaty, can get so much hawt poontang. And they are also jealous of his mammoth cock (aren't we all?).

More importantly, [[Sick fuck|NO FUCKING MASTURBATING YOU SICK FUCK!]] the church firmly believes if you do "rub one out", [http://xxxchurch.com/getinvolved/pornpatrol/kittens/index.html God will kill a kitten.] (Srsly!!11!)

[[Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhh|Porn is an addiction]], so kick your addiction for [[Jesus.]] Somehow, the site has [[Lies|some stories]] on how [[Porn|porn]] ruins lives. This is true if your a [[People|non-furry]] looking at [[8HORNS|furry porn of your childhood memories.]]
And can you believe their mascot is a [[Furry|furry?]] [[Hypocrite|Yep.]]

Central to the XxxChurch's (or X3, to those whose wrists cant manage to type in full) belief system is the [http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/04/porn.addiction/index.html "Porn and Pancakes"] ceremony. There is little evidence as to what goes on at these events, but if wild speculation was anything to go by, you should assume that it involves sex WITH food, or the reference to "pancakes" could be code for "underdeveloped breasts".  Who knows?  Perhaps it is better left to the imagination.

{{quote|When I was pregnant with my 17 month old I caught him in the bathroom with my cell phone looking at porn. I was ready to end the relationship then, but we managed to work past it. He told me he loved me, and assured it wouldn't happen again. I just had our son on 3/16/2010. I had a c-section, and the baby had some problems with his lungs, so he was in NICU for four days. We were out of the hospital for exactly one week when I accidently stumbuled accross his porn collection in his truck... He was watching porn the day after I had his son. I was laying in the hospital barely able to move around and he was at home watching porn when he was supposed to be watching our kids.|Heather, on discovering the porn-truck .}}

== Footnote:Trolls? ==

Considering these "anti" porn guys spend so much time in porno conventions, and so much time in the company of Ron Jeremy, not to mention PETE the porno puppet,and the DON'T SPANK YOUR MONKEY literature, you have to wonder if these guys aren't just trolls themselves. Trolls who clearly make money AND get teh pussy.
