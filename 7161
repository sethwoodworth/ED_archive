SPUI

'''SPUI,''' or "ST. SPUI"  was a martyr for great justice. He was harassed and tormented by the unfunny Wikipedos for the great crime of being funny...until he stopped making jokes.

==Pedophilia Userbox War==

SPUI first came to the attention of the [[ArbCom]] during the "Pedophilia Userbox War," when he was accused of "inflaming the dispute" by recreating the deleted pedophile userbox, and attaching "omg! I have been sexually attracted to underage females without being an underage female myself!" to the template [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pedophilia_userbox_wheel_war#SPUI.27s_recreation_of_the_Pedophilia_template]  For this foul outrage, SPUI was banned for ten days and placed on probation for a year. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pedophilia_userbox_wheel_war#SPUI].

==SPUI Violates Probation==
During his probation, SPUI used the edit summary "what the fuck?" several times!!! He even did this ''while making a minor edit to the Denny's article!!!''  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denny%27s&diff=46286743&oldid=45956663] These heinous violations were duly reported, and SPUI was blocked for a week by [[Tony Sidaway]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pedophilia_userbox_wheel_war#Log_of_blocks_and_bans]  SPUI also recreated the talkpage for the [[Brian Peppers]] article after it was deleted by [[Jimbo Wales]].  

==RfC for SPUI==
SPUI also  persisted in "imposing a new naming scheme" on several highway projects. At the RfC convened to harangue SPUI, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/SPUI] he was accused of "engaging in massive disruption of pages related to WikiProject California State Highways, WikiProject U.S. Roads, WikiProject Washington State Highways, and related projects. He has unilaterally attempted to impose a new naming convention for state highways without even attempting to seek consensus for the change, and has repeatedly moved hundreds of pages to new names consistent with his personal naming scheme." Oh noes!  It was also alleged that "When others have attempted to engage him on the subject, he has become hostile and abusive."  His "hostile abuse" included saying "Haha," and "Naw, I'd rather piss you off,"  which drove many post-traumatic-stress sufferers to therapy (they still have not recovered; damage may be permanent).  On the talkpage of the RfC, SPUI asked: "Will you guys call it vandalism if I put a Portal US Roads Template on the RFC? :)" --SPUI (talk - don't use sorted stub templates!) 22:51, 31 March 2006 (UTC) He was told: "Depends on the contex of how and where you place it. If it's put on as part of an expose then no. If it's put on just for the sake of putting it on and you write "Fuck you all" in the edits summary... then yes." JohnnyBGood 00:06, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

He also had conversations that went like this:


*We've asked time and time again, stop making controversial page moves with no consensus! --Rschen7754 (talk - contribs) 23:14, 10 March 2006 (UTC)
**Eat my penis. --SPUI (talk - don't use sorted stub templates!) 23:20, 10 March 2006 (UTC)
***You know, a comment like that that could be taken the wrong way. Let's all be nice. -Will Beback 10:06, 14 March 2006 (UTC)
****What, are you a homophobe? --SPUI (talk - don't use sorted stub templates!) 10:40, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

==SPUI's Sockpuppet==
In the RfC, it was also discovered that SPUI had a sockpuppet...named "sockenpuppe." Imagine how cold and lonely for poor misunderstood SPUI when no one laughed;  this was merely dully recorded in the list of his crimes by the uncomprehending Wikipedos. 

==Goodbye to Your Mom== 
Alas, SPUI made one last "your mom" joke, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SPUI&diff=44465982&oldid=44465933] and now he jokes no more. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SPUI]
