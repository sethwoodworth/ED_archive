Piratekiller
This article is ovar [[At least 100 years ago|100 years]] old. The [[RIAA|Jews]] figured out [[last Thursday]] that suing your customers isn't [http://boingboing.net/2007/10/03/riaa-our-antifan-law.html the best way to make] them [[money|monies]].

To anyone who downloads their music off of Kazaa or any similar program, you might want to know this. 

The [[fag|RIAA]] claims to have a new kind of software called "Piratekiller" that is designed to stop music piracy. It is still being debated whether or not this is legal, but the RIAA plans to launch it [[Last Thursday|sometime next month]]. The program will automatically find and track down anyone who is discovered using piracy programs, and they plan to prosecute everyone they find. If you are found to be in possession of illegally downloaded music, you're likely to be given somewhere [[At least 100|around 5 years]] in prison if you have a lot of it.
