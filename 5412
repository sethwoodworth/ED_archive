'''Minichan''' is one of the many [[shitty]] and thoroughly forgettable [[AnonTalk]] clones that consistently circle the drain of the thinking man's internets, hurriedly thrown together from the pitiful dregs of [[Tinychan]]. Its [[tripfags|inhabitants]] claim to be refugees of Tinychan, however fleeing the heartbreak of [[mod]] abuse for a brave new [[hugbox]] does not make you a refugee; it makes you a [[retard]].

The board is administered by a [[British|britfag]] who refers to himself as [[Kimmo|'''sim''']], a name which you will notice is [[gay|short and snappy]], and would be easy to remember were it not for the fact that the boy behind it is so [[homosexual|bland]]. He and the halfwits over at Minichan would love to be a totally cool and popular [[BBS]], except they fall horrifically short due to the incredibly [[newfag|stupid userbase]] and the fact that only around five people actually post there. When you see an anonymous poster on Minichan, it's one of the site owners/mods/users/fags posting anonymously to make the site look active.

==Userbase==
[[File:Typical_MC_Discussion.png|right|thumb|A typical day at Minichan.]]
[[File:TypicalMC.png|left|thumb|An example of the quality discussion at Minichan.]]
Unlike most *chan sites and [[AnonTalk]] clones, having a tripcode while posting on Minichan is ''de facto'' necessary. Anonymous users are chided for not being easily identifiable, since nearly every thread consists of criticizing somebody's online persona.

[[File:Minichan_militant_tripfags.png|right|thumb|Use a tripcode so we can ridicule you, you ''pussy!'']]
Cracking a user's tripcode is considered a cardinal sin worse than [[Madeline McCann|murdering your own child]]. This crime is typically punished with a [[banned|ban]] and an IP block, despite the fact that nearly everybody — even [[moot]] himself — has had his or her tripcode cracked at some point in time. The board offers "secure tripcodes", but the developers (sim and whomever sim can steal code from) put in the most retarded "secure tripcode" algorithm known to man that makes every single one [[borg|look exactly the same]]. Instead of using 64-bit, base 64-encoded strings, sim went [[retard|full retard]] and forced everybody to use unidentifiable, 32-bit, lowercase hexadecimal strings.

==Mod drama==
[[File:Minichan_freedom_of_speech.png|thumb|200px|Modfagging it up]] <!-- To all those who think you who dispute this graphic: WAAAAH I WANNA USE SEMANTICS TO COVER UP MY BUTTHURT, WAAAAH. -->
On the majority of *chan forums, and on most Internet forums in general, moderators are expected to give a "light touch" to nudge users into being compliant with all rules and prevent any instances of raging. Minichan takes a completely different approach to forum moderation; rather than using a "light touch", they prefer a [[rape|sledge hammer and blowtorch]].

It is perfectly acceptable for a moderator to edit a user's post and stalk a user using his IP address, despite what it says in the site's [http://minichan.org/rules rules]. This merely feeds the mod drama, but sim is always ready to evaluate everybody's attitude and [[Delete fucking everything|restore order]].

===Bribing away mod drama===
Still living under the delusion that [[lol|forums earn money]], sim decided to hatch a [[hurr|brilliant plan]] to reduce mod drama, increase [[USI|namefag recognition]], gain [[blowjobs|respect from moderators]] and earn [[jewgolds|money]] at the same time: ''asking users to pay him $5 per year to put a gold star next to their name.'' Yes, you read that right: sim tore a page out of the flower-child-Kindergarten-teacher playbook and used it to Jew his users out of money.

==How to troll Minichan==
It's extremely easy to troll MC and its users. Simply do one of the following:
* Start a topic that contains phrases such as "pronounced as one word," "girlfart," and use ''Depressionman #poopfart'' as the name. The thread will turn into a 200-reply dramafest.
* Start a topic with the name ''sK'' (use any tripcode) and flood fatfuck.jpg. This is sure to get a rise out of [[Matthew_Miller|Depressionman]].
* Create a new topic and mention how inferior Minichan is to [[Tinychan]] and that [[Special:Contributions/Thez0rper|ltamake]] is a superior coder and site admin to r04r or sim. 
* Create a topic asking if you can remove the footer link from MC's software, [[Shit|TinyBBS]].
* Post as a popular namefag using a cracked tripcode. This creates lulz because most MC users are [[autistic]] teenagers infected with [[USI]] and can't stand being imitated on the Internet.
* Post [[TehBigToaster|AnonBBS]] or [[Tinychan]] spam. This will cause sim to report said sites and bitch about it in IRC

==Site policies==
[[File:Nofunzone.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Canada welcomes you.]]
[[File:Typical Minichan Ban Reason.png|right|thumb|300px|Typical Minichan ban.]]
The Web host that Minichan uses is in [[Canada]]. The decency, obscenity, and "hate speech" laws are so strict that saying the word [[Black people|black]] (as in, "black hole" or "black paint") may be construed as a racist, and thereby illegal, statement. [[Piss|Urine play]] and [[Shit|scat porn]] are strictly forbidden. The admins (sim in particular) are so [[paranoid]] about losing their site that they are willing on [[censoring]] anybody who uses the words "piss" and "shit".

<s>The only reason that the site is hosted in Canada, according to moderators, is due to the very low price. Meanwhile, the site admin hosts a barely-used BBS whose purpose no longer exists. Go figure.</s>

Not anymore! Their current shitty host ReWired Host had their servers repossed by [[nigger|repo man]].

<s>Recently, the site moved to an [[American]] server, but the [[fags|admins]] are still [[fail|enforcing the Canadian rules]].</s>

LOL Now it is on PRQ.

=="Sim"==

{{quote|Get fucked.|Sim's standard response to an opinion he doesn't agree to, or a fact he refuses to believe.}}
{{quote|I'm a noob.|Sim showing his true colours.}}

The main administer, '''sim''', lives in the United Kingdom and claims his real name is "Simon Frost". Generally, being British would entail being very intelligent, cool-headed and having a brutally honest sense of humor. Unfortunately for Simon, his intelligence seems to come more from [[BP|British oil companies]] than British universities. He also has anger management issues that make [[Chris-chan]] seem like a compassionate and sociable guy. His entire repertoire of humor consists of such great responses as "[[unfunny|Oh, okay]]" and "[[Rage|GET FUCKED]]".

===Technological ineptitude===
[[File:Minichan_Sim_fails_at_hexadecimal.png|center|thumb|400px|In sim's world, "hexadecimal" means "base 32".]]

Sim forced his way onto the TinyBBS development team by offering private messaging to the original ATBBS code base. His contributions, among others, are:

* A "secure tripcode" algorithm that encodes your tripcode in [[lolwut|MD5]]. Your tripcode can actually "leak" onto the board if you type it in incorrectly, or put it after non-ASCII characters. Apparently, sim couldn't take a well-established 2ch/4ch algorithm and implement it without fucking it up.
* A [[CAPTCHA|reCAPTCHA]] component. Unlike every other Web site in existence, if you need to solve a CAPTCHA, the site deletes your cookies (essentially wiping out your account), blanks the screen and throws away whatever you were about to submit. Google's directions on using the reCAPTCHA API aren't written in a childish form of British English, so we can't blame sim for not understanding it.
* A new and novel way of generating anonymous usernames, where ''every post made'' locks the entire post table.
* A private messaging system that mods can use to harass people without having to make a sticky post.
* A proxy blocking component. He uses a public blacklist of proxies, and he's even added AT&T/Verizon/other cell phone networks to the list so they can't generate UIDs.

Sim frequently makes threads bragging about his Galaxy S cell phone and its superior screen. If you mention the iPhone 4 (whose screen has a significantly ''higher'' resolution), sim will ban you and call you a troll. He once went so far as to ban all AT&T customers. (He later narrowed the ban down to a few IP addresses; [[Lie|cell phone users can't get a new IP address, right?]])

{{quote|Is it feature request season already? 

I'd like to point out no new features will be added for the time being.| Sim, showing how much he cares about his board and [[Lusers|users]]}}

===Financial ineptitude===
Sim claims that the British economy is better than the U.S. economy, despite the fact that Britain's gross domestic product is somewhere between the individual states of California and Texas. He bases this "[[opinion |fact]]" on the value of the British pound being 50% higher than that of the dollar. If you mention to sim that the value of the British pound used to be [[Over 9000|over 480%]] above that of the dollar, he'll ban you and call you a [[troll]].

Sim, however, still levies his "gold star" prices in dollars.

===Social ineptitude===
[[File:Minichan_topic_11168_reply_202473.png|right|thumb|200px|Not just a river in Egypt.]]
{{quote|The majority of the article is pretty much a personal attack on me by someone [[Butthurt|butthurt]] over something I don't know. [[Denial|It makes it funnier though.]]|Sim, trying to cover up his own butthurt.}}

A diagnosis of [[Asperger's syndrome|Asperger's]] can easily be given after reading [http://pastebay.com/105122 sim's] [http://pastebay.com/105123 anger] [http://pastebay.com/112705 laced] [http://www.pastebay.com/106612 rants].

Sim will not communicate through any media that he does not completely control with [[Skript kiddie|absolute fucking power]]. If you ask him to chat on [[IRC]], he will join the network but create his own channel — and kickban anybody who does not kiss his limey arse. He refuses to chat on [[Tinychat]] because he can only control rooms he creates and nobody will join them.

<s>His only saving grace is his creation of yet another AnonTalk clone on Kimmo's "bulletproof" Web host, PRQ.</s> [[DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS|DISREGARD THAT SIM SUCKS COCKS]]. AnonTalk is back up.

=="r04r"==
r04r (possible names: Lis, Jillian), a self admitted [[Chris-chan|autistic]] [[fag|lesbian]], is a supposed [[fail|coder]] for TinyBBS. [[No_girls_on_the_internet|She]] codes [[Lie|a lot]] of TinyBBS, and does a pretty shitty job of it. For starters, she's clearly never heard of functions or grouping your code out so it actually makes sense. She also doesn't realize that ATBBS was never meant to be a serious BBS software, and tries to turn it into [[phpBB]] at every chance she gets.

===r04r vs. ltamake===
When ltamake reopened [[Tinychan]], the admins of MC started conspiring on how to take them down. r04r accused ltamake of using her super-secret, AIDS-curing, world-peace-generating database class and was prompt to ask for a link to her website on Tinychan. ltamake, as stupid as he is, agreed. However, once Simmo started trolling him, he removed it. This resulted in a bitter relationship between Tinychan and Minichan, with users spamming and raiding each other back and forth like /b/tards. r04r and ltamake have since then [[buttsex| made up]], with Simmo being the only one who still gives two shits about the supposed "[[13-year-old-boys|boardwar]]".
