In his spare time (which is all the time cuz dat nigga in JAIL yo, he don't got shit to do 'cept buy shit from the commissary an' [[in the ass|become Bubbaz bitch]] an shit foo), he likes to sue people, things, and places. A lot.[[Image:Jonathanleeriches.jpg|thumb|It's Jonathan Lee., Riches©, superlitigious superhacker superhero]]

He is also legendary hacker superhero Gino Romano, but everyone keeps stealing his identity and trying to kill him and commit treason. And stuff.

=== Riches v. Bush ===
[[image:Riches4prez.jpg|thumb|Riches' 2004 campaign plagiarized by Obama]]
*Filed: February 16, 2006
*Plaintiff: Jonathan Lee., RicHes©
*Defendant: [[George W. Bush]], individually and in his official capacity as PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES
*Case number: 4:2006cv00442
*District Court: SC
*What the nigga claims: George W. Bush is involved with a vast conspiracy of Uniform commercial code "UCC" followers. They're using JLR's copyrighted [[ALL CAPS|allcaps]] name without his consent. The Federal Reserve is a fraud as Federal Reserve notes are backed by nothing of substance. George Bush, [[Queen]] of [[England]], Chubby Checker, [[Drama Llama|Dalai Lama]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Cutting|Bloods]] and [[Crips]] of [[Detroit]], [[Columbine|trench coat Mafia]], Sen. [[Arlen Spector]], [[Gambino]] crime family, Sen [[Trent Lott]], and other parties he refuses to name for fear of his safety, through subliminal messaging, RFID tracking devices, radio active chemicals released into the air by United Airline pilots, George Bush was involved with the construction of FCI Williamsburg. However, Bush failed to build an anti [[UFO]] defense system around the compound, released staph infection in the prison water system, and sold inmates' personal bonds on the international stock market without their consent. JLR says he is personally subjected to microwave testing on a daily basis. He also says that Bush is committing treason by selling our DNA to the "[[Hitler]] [[Socialist]] [[Party Van|Party]]". He then goes on to allege that Bush is a "voodoo witch doctor" involved with transforming humans to animals, sometimes plants. Also, FCI Williamsburg has robotic guards made from Bush's NASA partners. He then alleges that the 14th Amendment was not ratified properly. He goes on to say that Bush is a time-traveler who conspired with the Duke of Normandy for the [[Bayeux Tapestry|Battle of Hastings]] in 1066 AD. Apparently, George H.W. Bush "is his front father contracted with secret [[wiccan|wiccans]] to pervert American citizens minds via WWW world wide web".
* Timeline (as given by JLR):
# January 4th 2003, George Bush stole his identity
# April 20th 2002, George Bush joined "alliance to [[Al Qaeda]]"
# October 31st 2001, George Bush is spelled hsuB egroeG backwards
* Laws alleged to have been broken: (more later)
* What the nigga wants:
# [[Over 9000|299,000,000,000,000.00]] trillion dollars backed by gold or silver delivered by USPS
# A restraining order "against George W Bush as I come in peace"
# A restraining order against Air Force One
* Outcome: Dismissed. Can't a nigger get justice in this country!?
