Sephiroth
{{spoiler|Kefka is the best videogame villain of all time, of all time!!}}

[[Image:McSephiroth.jpg|thumb|right|HAWT!.]]
Sephiroth (also Sphiroth, [[1337|53ph1r07h]], and [[Retard|George Bush]]) is the main villain of ''[[Final Fantasy 7|Final Fantasy VII]]''. Both the game and its main villain are worshiped by [[16 year old girls|sixteen year old girls]], [[13 year old boys|thirteen year old boys]], and [[Cellar-dweller|Final Fantasy fans]] alike. As with many [[God|obsessively worshiped objects]], Sephiroth is somewhat prone to [[homosexual|faggotry]]. His weapon of choice is that of a seven-foot-long bastardkatana. Either he is suffering from [[Bleach|HUGE FUCKING SWORD SYNDROME]] (a common side effect of having an [[ITTY BITTY BABY ITTY BITTY BOAT|Itty Bitty Boat]]), or he is compensating for something [[Cock|he don't got.]] The only people who don't seem to support him are those damn clown-loving Kefka freaks, thus enabling the never-ending Kefka vs Sephiroth cockfight.

Sephiroth is a major villain in the [[video game]] ''Final Fantasy VII''. Bad writing on behalf of the game designers muddled any backstory this character may have had, while bad design provided him with a [[cock|weapon]] three times as tall as himself. Also, for some reason, he is 70% legs. 

[[Fanboy]]s ate this shit up then spewed it back onto the unsuspecting [[Internets]].

== Irreparable Damage ==
Sephiroth (and any equivalent pussy) has done the following:
*Thoroughly licked his [[Retard|freak-of-nature]] mother's cunt at every given moment. Please note that Sephiroth's mother has, naturally, eyes for nipples. Use this information as you so choose.
*In a fit of [[angst]], sets fire to an insignificant country town because, like his mother, he discovers that he too is a [[Retard|freak of nature]]. Cloud, the equally angsty yet blonde main character of ''[[Final Fantasy 7|Final Fantasy VII]]'', gets pissy over this but still wants his [[Anal sex|fudge packed]] by Sephiroth, as do at least 67% of the other characters. (Note: Every Sephiroth [[fangirl]] in existence [[masturbate]]s to this scene.)
*Killed a certain [[Mary Sue]] but only because she got more [[sex]] than he did. Honestly, a [[Asking for it|church-going flower girl]]? That's definitely a cover up for [[prostitute|prostitution]], and/or major weapons dealing. Interestingly this was the only moment that could possibly contain lulz in the history of ''Final Fantasy'' because it made basement-dwellers cry.
*Blew up half the solar system just to attack a small group of [[azns]] only to [[epic fail|fail epically]].
*Fails at summoning something called "Meteor" which was supposed to make him into [[Jesus]], endowing him with the ability of insta-pwn. There's probably some lengthy explanation for this mess but it's insignificant compared to the power of the [http://vadercrisp.ytmnd.com tender crisp bacon cheddar ranch]. 

Sephiroth was arrested in June but was released on 15,000,000 gil bail at least 100 years ago.
He is currently residing in Utah and is wanted for 6 counts of possession of child pornography and the murder of an ancient, although witness reports state that she was in fact [[asking for it]]. It is also theorized that Sephiroth was responsible for [[WTC]]. 

These actions weren't put into any special order since greater acts of villainy could easily be committed by [[your mom]]. It's also not that difficult to destroy a town with, like, nine people living there and then spend most of your later time [[terrorist|brooding in a hole]] about [[your mom]].

[[Image:Slovesthepenis.jpg|thumb|right|A man's [[homosexual|true sexuality]] is revealed]]
Sephiroth has played a role in every type of [[fanfiction]], [[fan art|fanart]], Japanese fancomic, pr0n, and top secret document. You'll see him in [[Mary Sue]] oriented stories, in the midst of [[mantrain|all-male orgies]], on the receiving end of [[bukkake]], pregnant, and with [[shitting dick nipples]].

== The Terrible Taste of Fangirls ==
[[Image:Sephirotten.jpg|thumb|right|Listen carefully and you can hear the fangirls [[masturbation|fapping to]] this!]]
Sephiroth, like any other lame villain, is easily differentiated from better villains simply by the [[goth|gawthik]] way he dresses. Callow, brainless [[fangirl]]s love him for his looks and his uncanny similarity to [[16 year old girls|themselves]].

The most notable of his attire includes his [[Mary Sue]]-like prematurely grayed hair and highlighter green eyes, his taste in [[homosexual|homoerotic]] leather that includes one of the [[angst]]-filled trenchcoats worn at Columbine, and combat boots purchased at [[Hot Topic]] for $250 plus tax.

== The Cult of Sephiroth ==
[[Image:Anicon sephy.JPG|thumb|right|A [[fangirl]] in the Cult of Sephiroth]]Each and every one of Sephiroth's [[fangirl]]s have dreams of marrying him someday. Until then, they offer sacrifices to their well guarded Sephiroth altars, all of which are covered in Sephiroth [[fan art|fanart]] and [[fanfiction]]. Depending on the type of fangirl they are, they either [[cosplay]] as Sephiroth themselves or take a buddy to cosplay as Sephiroth while they cosplay as Aeris or another bothersome [[Mary Sue]]. If the latter occurs, the fangirl will doubtlessly drool into "Sephiroth"'s mouth and never brush their teeth again.

Mention you hate Sephiroth to one of these [[obsession|obsessive]] fangirls and a [[flame war]] will begin. If you can wade through the eye-rotting fifty page essays of why these fangirls think Sephiroth is so great, then you'll find hours of [[lulz]] inside. Tell your friends!

Some of the most [[lulz]]worthy fangirls include [[Summoner Yuna]] and [[Sephirothslave]].

== The Sephiroth Invasion ==
After ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'''s release in the United States, [[roleplayers]] in chat rooms all across the internet adopted the Sephiroth identity as their own. Sephiroth was a particularly popular role to take on in any [[Dungeons and Dragons]] chat room with [[avatar]]s enabled. [[Fat]], [[ugly]] and [[anthropophobia|anthropophobic]] people could disguise their shortcomings behind this image of a dark and mysterious figure. [[Gay|Single girls]] with no knowledge of the video game were often enamored by the ruse while other male roleplayers would fight over who was the real Sephiroth. See: [[Velcro's Law]].

Soon Sephiroth spread outward from his [[basement-dwelling]] roots. [[Irc]] chats, social lounges, message boards, and even [[cybersex]] sites were filled past capacity by socially and mentally disabled teenagers. Within days the Sephiroths numbered so many that [[lame|imaginative]] surnames and decorations had to be added to each Sephiroth's [[screen name]].

Sephiroth was ultimately and unceremoniously ousted by the character ''Neo'' from ''[[The Matrix]]''.  However, the recent release of a Direct-to-Video ''Final Fantasy'' [[movie]] has breathed new life to this phenomena.

== Lasting Effects ==

To this day, variants of the name Sephiroth remain an effective means of [[troll]]ing without saying a single word. Adding [[AOL]]-friendly decorations, leetspeak substitutions, or any cool sounding word to the name can instantly raise alarm in any online community. Examples include ''xxoSEPHIROTHoxx'', ''[[User:S3phir0th|S3phir0th]]'', and ''Sephiroth_Prime'' respectively.  

== Baby falls victim to a weeaboo Sephiroth fangirl/[[Whore|teenage mother]] ==

2008, Shawna Murphy(A [[Wapanese|weeaboo]], druggie,[[Whore|Fangirl]].)  Also part of some weeaboo cult called a [[Cosplay|cosplay]] gathering) gave birth to a son at the age of 19.
She named the child Sephiroth, on his birth certificate as the childs legal binding name, dooming this child to be [[An Hero|ridiculed]] in life.
To call the woman a crazy bitch wouldnt even be the half of it.  Not to mention she doesn't even know who the real father is.

Sephiroth, a child born from the disease known as weeaboo, could be the first of many of these kinds of children born within the next generation.
Hopefully this one won't [[Incest|treat]] his mother like the fictional one does his own.
