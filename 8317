The Tails Realm
[[File:gaytailssig.jpg|right|thumb|It gets ludicrously gay.]]
The Tails Realm is a website dedicated to the two-tailed, turd-brown faggot from [[Sonic the Hedgehog]], Miles "Tails" Prower, that no one gives a fuck about except depressed fourteen year-olds who get the crap beat out of them by preschoolers, nuns and/or [[Straight|Donny Osmond]]. They idolize [[Tails]]; he is their role model and their means of "mental stability." While you'd expect them to have all committed [[suicide]] or get smacked to death [[Sandalgate|by a shoe]], they've all huddled into a little site that's been under construction for the [[at least 100 years|past 100 years]]. Also be aware that The Tails Realm mods and admins will ban you on sight if you aren't a [[Fantard|ZOMFG TAILZ FAN 4 LYF!!!!]]

==''Cauda homosexualis retardi'' (The Tails Fan) ==

[[File:firewave.jpg|right|thumb|You can tell a fan character is good when his fighting style is ripped from a crappy show with a [[Naruto|"ninja" in a fucking orange jumpsuit.]]]]
[[File:warghzh.jpg|left|thumb|[[buttsecks|I wonder why he wants it to be real...]]]]The ''Cauda homosexualis retardi'' or Tails Fan, is generally a shy and unsocial creature with unsophisticated qualities in relation to asininity. While at first it appears docile, it at heart, is not. When provoked, (usually by saying "Tails is [[gay]]"), it will irrationally respond with nonsensical ramblings about how it sucks to be you, and that Tails is great and it wants to have his [[babies]].

Consider the physical characteristics of the Tails fan. The [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] look is large pimply foreheads, braces with yellow teeth, and a short haircut traced with a salad bowl. If you believe this to be incorrect, you are mistaken. It is difficult to tell the Tailstards apart, physically and personality wise. Some tend to believe Tails exists in an alternate dimension. (No, I am not kidding. Some actually believe that.) These deluded creatures create sacred shrines composed entirely of binary code to what they believe to be their God (Tails). [[File:tailsletter.jpg|right|thumb|.........]]Instead of performing sacrificial ceremonies to honor Tails, they find it customary to copulate with plushies of him. Scientists believe that this is a way for the Tails fan to find a secret inner peace within themselves. These Tails fans who grab their ankles for their God have been named ''Animal anthropomorphus''. Also known as simply, "[[Furry|The Furry]]."


[[File:tailsboard.jpg|left|thumb|Showing threads that Tails fags write are used for therapeutic purposes for people with low self-esteem; These clients realize someone else out there sucks more than them.]]The language of the Tails fan is composed of a total of five words. They are: "Love, [[kawaii]], cute, adorable, and Tails." The language is known as "[[Idiot]]." To speak Idiot, all you must do is combine all five words into an almost functioning sentence such as this: "Love Tails; [[kawaii]], adorable, cute!"  Most Tails fans will say that same sentence like this: "lUv TaiLes: KAWA!!, @duRiBle, CuT!!!!!!!111" Scientists believe they are attempting to invoke their Lord's presence with these sacred chants from the alternate dimension we mentioned earlier. 

If you encounter one of these strange humans it is suggested you attack them.  Despite protection by the [[Dumbfuck|US goverment]], they still deserve to die.

[[File:Jamesbondlotus.jpg|thumb|Typical reaction when people visit The Tails Realm.]] You might think Tails fans live in colonies or packs. Surprisingly, they do not. They are solitary creatures, gathering to meet only for breeding and to recount tales of Tails, told by the lucky ones, chosen at random as Avatar for the day. Although they gather frequently to breed, they seldom produce viable young because they always end up masturbating to their God.

==An Assload of Pink==
The Tails Realm has been under construction for [[at least 100 years]], and fortunately, it shows no sign of progress; however, there are a total of two things a Tails fag can do on here--click a button to give out hugs or go to an invisionfree forum enveloped in a bright pink background that makes the gay pride parades envious. As expected,[[File:roflpainttails.jpg|right|thumb|Typical fan-character found on The Tails Realm..]] there isn't much to talk about on the forum other than what kind of dress Tails would look best in or make up [[emo]] fan characters which successfully out-gay [[Cutter|Shadow]].

==Tips on Getting Banned==
*Provide negative criticism on fan characters.
*Provide negative criticism on Tails.
*Provide negative criticism on the banner.
*Provide negative criticism on the background color.
*Provide negative criticism on [[fan fiction|fan fictions]].
*Spell Tails' name backwards.
*Say that Tails does not exist and never will.
*Say that Tails is dead.
*Do what 006/Storm did
Tails fags have low tolerance for any criticism that could be considered constructive. If any appears negative, the assumption is that a hater is trying to cause havoc. Then, these estrogen-intoxicated [[noob|man-fairies]] will get infuriated, ban you, and then cut themselves while singing along to Tails' Theme from Sonic Adventure 2.

This article has ostensibly achieved almost instantaneous fame on The Tails Realm. The controversy it created is quite a read. Feel the [[lulz]].

File:superkarl.jpg|Good luck on that [[livejournal]] article. I hope you don't overuse too many smilies; however, ED has a lot more on you than you have on ED. For example, you have a [[Final Fantasy VII]] fanfic. You're also a Tails fan, and you have a fan character recoloration of Tails...and of all things the poor guy is [[gay|purple]].
File:flyboyfox.jpg|Listen to the interdimensional believer. Underneath its deluded philosophies, there rests a spark of sagacious veracity that's not so sagacious afterall. It turned out to be packing peanuts.
