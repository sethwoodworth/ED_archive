Kyhell; is the Moshe Dyan all-star of [[LiveVideo]].com and [[internets]] ethics. [[Some argue|Many argue]] that Kyhell is best known for being the [[drama]] loving bisexual that left [[YouTube]] after freaking out all of his subscribers [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcQop7bEd58] KyHell is also notable for being the only known member of The Promised Land to punished by LV [[admin]]s. The punishment ? Restricting messaging access (LOL). But don't worry Kyhell is only a '''"character actor"'''.

In his quest for "truth and righteousness", Chris has attracted quite a number of [[hater]]s throughout [[internets|the world wide web]]. Their many qualms against him vary from usage of [[IRL]] [[rape]], to possible threats of [[troll]]ing. KyHell in many ways infuriated the hater community when he made a video, claiming he was having a nice life whist he gave up his heroin habit. KyHell's facial hair is said to be the secret of his power, it is rumored when he shaves no one listens to his [[vlog]]s. However, most argue that no one listens to KyHell at all - unless it has something to do with [[drama]].
