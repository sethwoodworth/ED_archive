Kevin Neil Whitrick
{{an hero}}

'''Kevin Whitrick''' (1965 - 3/23/2007) caused much [[Internet drama]] and became [[an hero]] after hanging himself...live on webcam. Apparently, Mr. Whitrick from Wellington, Telford, Shropshire, [[England]] had [[butthurt|chronic depression]], so the best course of action for him was to be a camwhore. In the spirit of [[Ripper|Brandon Vedas]], he too wanted to prove he was hardcore, and went into a chatroom full of spiteful trolls on Paltalk. He claimed he wanted to [[permaban]] himself from life, and other users egged him on. One member (in true English style) went as far as to say:

{{quote|Fucking do it, get on with it! Get it round your neck. For fuck's sake...he can't even do this properly!}}

==In Memoriam==

Kevin Neil Whitrick was a true pioneer, a man with a vision. Whitrick was to webcam broadcasts what [[Budd Dwyer]] was to televised press conferences. Brandon Vedas aside, Whitrick was the first man to intentionally [[self-pwn]] on streaming webcam. It is to this man and his genius that this page is dedicated. 

{{quote|Southern trees bear strange fruit,
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
White body swinging in the southern breeze,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.

Pastoral scene of the gallant south,
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh,
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop,
Here is a strange and bitter crop|Lemmy Kilmister, Motorhead}}

Inevitably, what the white man has, the [[CandyJunkie|black man]] taketh away.
