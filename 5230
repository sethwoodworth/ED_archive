Masters of Deception
'''Masters of Deception''' ('''MOD''') was a group of [[hacker]]s from [[New York]]. MOD claimed to have [[hack]]ed into  a few unknown telephone RBOC's, x.25 networks, but never quite made it on the [[Internet]]. It has been proven by AT&T that MOD's allegations were false, and surely if they had been alive when the [[Internet]] was created, they would not have had the skills to [[hack]] anything on it anyways.

==History==
MOD began as [[hack]]ers occasionally met accidentally on RBOC phone switches and DEC Servers as they could not figure out how to login to the [[hardcore]] bulletin boards. They stayed underground for [[at least 100]] years and were basically the [[typical]] [[stereotype]] of [[hacker]]s, much like [[f8labs]].

Acid Phreak founded Masters of Deception with Scorpion and Hac. Due to a legal dispute with [[Legion of Doom]], MOD was forced to change from their former 'L' to the new 'M'.  This dispute settled out of court where Lex Luther stole the [[blue box]] of Acid Phreak and refused to give it back. The only hacking technique MOD could muster was to call LOD members and pay them for their accounts.

==Members==
Masters of Deception included the founders of MOD: "[[Phiber Optik]]", "Scorpion", "Tr0n", "Acid Phreak", "Corrupt" a.k.a. "Netw1z", "[[Kevin_Mitnick|Condor]] and "Outlaw" plus [[at least 100]] more.

==Full Disclosure==
The Masters Of Deception were different to other [[hack]]ing groups as they founded the [[full disclosure]] mailing list. Fourteen months after the lists creation, [[Len Rose|Terminus]] stole the list with a mailman 0day. Recently the list was bought by [[Israel]]i millionaire [[Gadi Evron]].

==Great Hacker War==
As they were a part the Great Hacker War all of its members were indicted in 2002 in federal court and were deported or sentenced to prison where they surely received forced [[goatse]]ation.
