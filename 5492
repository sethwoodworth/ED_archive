Mornington Crescent
[[Image:Tube map.gif|thumb|You'll be needing this.]]
'''Mornington Crescent''' is an absurdly complicated [[The_game|game]] invented [[over_9000|over 9000]] years ago by former British king, Eton-educated aristocrat '''Humphrey Lyttelton'''. It centres around navigation of the [[london|London]] underground, following any number of [[shit_nobody_cares_about|rules]] that are presented in a special code only Britfags understand.

Recently, since Humphrey received the [[IRL]] [[banhammer]], every single [[Britfag]] on [[b|/b/'s]] everywhere has been playing the game in the obscure hours of the night while the [[america|rest of us]] are asleep. An underground society has been established to a point that the moment anyone posts a Mornington Crescent image at any time the Britfags are awake results in huge, complicated games taking place, branching off into multiple subgames.

==A non-britfags guide to playing==

There are essentially two plays that one can make in a game of online Mornington Crescent. The first being a move, and the second being a challenge.


:'''A move:'''

A move, which can only played in turn, is the simplest play. Following the established rule set (stated before the game begins), each move will contain up to three separate parts:
*The move itself, stating which station to play to
*Any quoted rules to explain more elaborate moves
*Any other notes to challenge or bluff your opponents.

The point of the move is not simply to state your play, but also to try to [[trap|ensnare the opposition]] in one of the many potential pitfalls, such as dead-end bilinear plays and other situations in which the opposition is forced to breach the rules.

In the event you make the winning move to Mornington Crescent, it is even more important to reinforce your move with as many rule quotes as possible. It is instinctive for the opposition to challenge such a move to try to reclaim [[the game]].


:'''A challenge:'''

Being a complicated game, it is often that a player unwittingly finds himself in breach of one of the many rules and regulations; however, if such a move goes unchallenged, play often goes on unaltered. A good player keeps a keen eye open for slip-ups on behalf of the opposition as to thwart any stratagems that they may be developing.

It is important to remain civil at all times when committing to a challenge, as well as stating which rule set your challenge is based off of. While challenges, unlike moves, can be made at any time, it is sometimes advisable ''NOT'' to challenge a move immediately (or at all), even if the basis for the challenge is solid, as challenging at the wrong time can give another opposing player an advantage.
