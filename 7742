Spike's Video Game Awards
{{stub}}
The Spike Video Game awards are brought to you by Burger King, Mountain Dew, 2011 Jeep Wrangler, Dr. Pepper, The US Army, Sprint, Verison and Gamespot. Spike's Video Game Awards is a time when independent companies (fueled by mountain dew) and huge studio game companies come together to win awards, too bad it's all rigged. If the game isn't an action first person shooter then it will lose every category. The VGAs are merely a popularity contest meaning only the over rated and over hyped games will win, games like Halo, Call of Duty, Mass Effect, Battlefield and Assassin's Creed. Winners are selecting by online poll voting.

Spike's Video Game Awards has received numerous hate mail about it being fake and gay. They choose random celebrities that know nothing of video games and don't even represent the game they give the award to. The whole thing is rigged and it's just one big promotion every year to make shit loads of money and promote games no one gives a shit about.
