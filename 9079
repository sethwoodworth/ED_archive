__NOTOC__
[[Image:Thefreshprinceofbelair.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Oh, how the mighty have fallen.]]In West [[Philadelphia]], born and raised, '''Will Smith''' is an [[Black_People|"African American"]] singer, actor, and former Prince of [[Bel-Air]].  He began his career as one of the most hardcore and explicit [[rap]]pers of all time, until he landed a gig on a hit TV show, and quickly cashed in his street cred for [[Hookers and blow|white wiminz and blow]].  As more and more reruns of ''Fresh Prince'' were reposted on American family television networks, he became increasingly marketed towards [[white]] audiences, to the point where Al Jolson could be considered more black.  He now stars in whatever blockbuster film comes out each summer in place of Denzel Washington, or whoever else was whitey's last favorite HNIC.

Smith is also a closet [[$cientologist]] too afraid to admit to the world his 'religious' views. By saying he admires $cientology but is [[lie|not a part of the cult]] he has attempted to make it seem ''logical'' and even ''brilliant''. 

In 2004 Will donated $20,000 to ''The Hollywood Education and Literacy Program'', a.k.a. Scientology's home-schooling program. Much like the [[Hitler]] Youth, this program is designed to bring young blood into the ranks of this cult.  He also donated [[Over 9000|$1 million]] of his money to start a Scientology private school for the scilons to brainwash his children.

Pinkett-Smith, who currently home-schools the couple's two children, has long been talking about opening up a school where Jaden, 9, and Willow, 7, can continue to receive an education '''in line with their beliefs'''|[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,360642,00.html LOL FOX NEWS]}}

Like a true Christian, he gave crew members of the movie ''Han[[cock]]'' gift cards for a Scientology personality test at any Church of Scientology center as a wrap present when filming was done (which really wasn't a gift so much as an advertisement, as Scifags already do this kind of shit for free). He could have given them rosary beads, crucifixes or [[Bible]]s, but no, it was $cientologist propaganda. Way to be a [[Bullshit|"Student of all religions,"]] Will!

This is an excerpt from his 1997 biography, [http://www.amazon.com/Will-Power-Biography-Smith/dp/067188784X ''Will Power! A Biography Of Will Smith''], in which Smith recounts a defining moment in his life:

<blockquote>
"The following is the tale about a turbulent time in my life, in which everything I had known seemingly became topsy-turvy.  So, if you have a moment, I would like to take this opportunity to tell you the story of how I became the proprietor of a lavish Bel-Air estate. <br> 
<br>
I grew up in West [[Philadelphia]], and spent most of my waking hours on the playgrounds of my locale.  After school my friends and I would wind down by scrimmaging on the [[basketball]] court on campus.  Oh, we would have such a [[gay]] time!  But all of a sudden, we were approached by a few hoodlums and a scuffle broke out.  My mother feared the worst, and insisted that it would be better for me to move in with some relatives on the west coast rather than risk any further incidents. <br> 
<br>
I objected, and put up a struggle for a few days, but it was of no use, and soon I was off.  Along with my plane ticket, I also brought along a [[iPod|personal stereo]], because I figured that I might as well make the best of the situation.  For some reason i ended up in first class seating, which was much different than anything that I had been accustomed to previously.  The [[shit was so cash|situation was so suave]], that they even took the liberty of serving my orange juice in a champagne glass.  I thought to myself, I could get used to this Bel-Air lifestyle, and began to dream about the luxuries which awaited me upon my arrival.  But then I had second thoughts.  I began to have reservations that my humble background and ruffian lifestyle might ostracize me socially from my [[Rich and beautiful|economically elite]] peers.  I finally decided that there was nothing I could do to change that at the moment, and I would just have to wait and see what happens when I got there, and try to remain positive.  I held hope that they would be prepared for my [[Attention whore|over-the-top bravado and boisterous personality]]!<br>
<br>
When my plane finally landed I nearly [[v&|had an incident with the law]].  When I came out of the terminal, a police officer was waiting for me, holding a placard with my name on it.  Rather than risk being incarcerated on my first day in a new city, I proceeded to [[GTFO|move to the exits with haste]], as to not arouse any suspicions.  I summoned a taxi-cab, and when it came into view, I noticed that it had quite a few idiosyncrasies, including a custom license plate reading "FRESH," and a pair of novelty fuzzy dice hanging from the driver's rear view mirror.  I thought for a moment, as to the immense odds that I would have such an escort on this occasion, perhaps indicating something of an omen, but quickly quashed that notion, as I had more [[srs bsns|important business]] to attend to.  I bid that my journey continue, and commanded the driver to proceed onward to my final destination.<br>
<br>
I finally arrived at my new home about a quarter before 8 PM, and it was none to soon;  the aromatic assault given off by my driver had become unbearable, and I figured that I could put off on [[DO NOT WANT|that particular olfactory sensation]] until another day.  I bid my hygienically challenged friend ''adieu'',  and took a brief survey of my new home.  I took this opportunity to reflect on the trials and tribulations of my journey, thus far, and was thankful for my safe arrival.  I was now ready to face my destiny, and take my place as [[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air|the social celebrity of this auspicious community]]."
