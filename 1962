[[Image:Djs233.jpg|thumb|right|Dan Keem: [[IRL]] 30 year old faggot.]]

[[Pedophile|DJ Keemstar]] (also known as Marshyd13 2: [[Electric Boogaloo]]) is a leader of a clan on [[xbox|exbawcks]] [[Xbox Live|live]] made up of [[12-year-old boys|12 year olds]] known as the [[12-year-old boys|"Federation of Asshole Gamers"]] or the [[faggot|"F@G"]].  He gained a following of many [[12-year-old boys|12 year old]] [[Halo]] [[fanboys]] who call their [[BDSM|dungeon master]] [[Lie|"Halo's #1 Trashtalker"]]: [[IRL]] he's a [[butthurt]] father with an extreme amount of [[unwarranted self importance]]. DJ spends his life on [[Xbox Live]], [[BlogTV]], and [[jewtube|Youtube]] where [[Talentless|he has 50,000 subscribers from dick riding]] machinima directors and [[Call of Duty]] commentators.  He begged them to advertise his youtube channel but, hilariously enough, the only people that actually subscribed were [[12-year-old boys]]. Surprisingly he is the #1 most subscribed on [[BlogTV]], which he accomplished by [[raging]] to his fans that its his life goal to be the most subscribed on the entire fucking website, [[losers|but who the fuck]] uses BlogTV? [[Everyone|Everyone uses Ustream.]] If you think about it, [[True|its not that hard]] getting #1 subscribed on a [[BlogTV|shitty web site]] that no one uses if you spend all day everyday streaming and [[Hitler|commanding little kids to subscribe]]. It is extremely likely that [[Google|he will at some point stumble upon this article]] and turn it into another excuse for him to [[fap]] to his own name while bitching and moaning on [[Shit|his BlogTV broadcast]] for five hours. When this time comes he should [[gtfo]] like the tool he is.

===Rise to "Fame"===
[[Image:F@glogo.jpg|thumb|right|Heres the shitty clan logo, it was made in MS Paint]]
One of the other [[faggot|G@Y]] members, [[Redneck|Deranker]], found DJ in a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1PzujQYfjc matchmaking game] where he was yelling at the other players like any other [[butthurt]] [[Halo 3]] player.  From there they slowly gained an internet following by convincing [[retard|12 year olds]] that their XBOX's were [[not funny|getting hacked and pretending to masturbate to girls over Halo 3 matchmaking.]] DJ has been doing this whole F@G thing for almost 2 years now, how did he get so popular? Well if you haven't noticed, not like the other F@G leaders, [[no life|F@G is Djs life, he needs to prostitute himself to make a living]] so he can please his 12 year old fanbase, thus boosting the losers self-esteem since he has [[Fact|no friends IRL]]. He whores himself out via the use of an [[J/k|anonymous]] 20 something year old hispanic male, who pretends to be a robot under the gamertag THE BAD ROBOT.  Despite its apparent success in fooling children, it is painfully obvious to be a text to speech program found on most [[Shit|Windows OS]] called Microsoft Michelle. Everyone knows that [[Kimmo Alm|DJ Keemstar]] would be a nobody on the internet if it wasn't for all of his 12 year old fanbase, considering what he does ANYONE can do.

===DJ and his Ego=== 
[[Image:Djpedobear.jpg|thumb|right|[[Doing it wrong|Trying not to be a pedophile]]]]	
From becoming a minuscule internet celebrity, DJ has become filled with [[unwarranted self importance]] to compensate for his small [[cock]]. He rants over [[internets|teh internetz]] about [[shit nobody cares about|what he is and isn't "about"]], and why people should give him money for making youtube videos.  [[Some argue]] that he just has his head up his ass, but they are usually just [[butthurt]] because he won't let them suck his tiny [[penis]].  The most common explanation is that he fancies himself the king of the [[internets]] because he has a surplus of [[12-year-old boys]] at his <s>sexual</s> disposal. [[some argue|Experts believe]] that he is even aware of what a loser he is, but to him [[awwright|it's AWWRIGHT!]]

===BlogTV Show===

Every day DJ broadcasts a live show at [http://www.blogtv.com/People/dj-keemstar this URL] which amazingly racks up [[kids on the internet|hundreds to thousands of viewers on any given night.]]  During said shows he begins by playing [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlRXKciI7NQ music of his own shitty making]. After playing his black person music until your ears bleed, DJ will either do one of two things for the rest of the stream, rage about [[shit nobody cares about]] for 5 hours, or attempt to impress [[12-year-old boys|his fans]] by [[Loser|trash talking kids half his age]] on a [[Halo 3|game that no one has played]] since [[at least 100 years ago]]. These shows are never to the [[Script kiddies|fans]] expectation as they are [[FACT|boring as fuck.]]  The entire viewing of the show is listening to the enormous [[faggot]] [[Self esteem|ramble about how he's famous]], blocking communications with every [[fanboy]] who sends him a message over [[Xbox Live]] saying how much they love [[SHIT|his videos]], and most importantly DJ will beg [[no one|everyone watching the stream]] to donate to his [[paypal]].  He needs money because [[FACT|he does NOT have a job]], His job is slowly transforming youtube in to one of his big steaming [[shit]] piles as he [[No life|streams so fucking much and uploads a video everyday]]. Then after doing all his [[faggotry]], DJ advertises to [[Retards|his fans]] that they can buy a friend slot or moderator position on the [[BlogTV]] chat for [[sarcasm|a mere]] $20.00. Should [[you]] pay $20 to be on DJs friend list, you should know that like the [[faggot]] he is, he will remove you if you do anything annoy him. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlCxriW2dD0 No joke.]  Some [[bullshit|reasonable]] ways to get on his nerves include:

*Wanting to play with him.
*Messaging him [[over 9000]] times because you paid $20 and he won't play with you.
*Betraying him ([[Irony|which the F@G built their reputation on]])
*Verbally pwning him in a trash-talking [[gangbang|session]].  Despite this thirty year old unhappily <s>married</s> dating [[douchebag]] promoting [[rape|verbal abuse]], he [[rage|rages]] hard at any treatment of similar [[Black people|color]] as he cannot handle anything that might [[pwn]] his image.   

If you paid $20.00 to be a mod of the Blog TV chat you can expect [[Suicide|similar treatment]].  Except you can also lose your $20 title [[DO IT FAGGOT|for posting his girlfriends number in public chat, and posting links in chat.  Specifically to this article.]]  It should also be said that because DJ lets any [[loser]] with $20 to his name moderate chat, rather than, say, choosing someone remotely competent for the job.  They all abuse their power more so than most other [[Moderator|moderators]] you might find on the internet and boot anyone who isn't worshipping the [[faggot]], and especially for stating disapproval of any copyrighted material that he broadcasts.  Like [[Fact|Origami World.]]

===How to Trash Talk like Kumstar===

[[Image: trashtalk.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gay|A typical DJ KEEMSTAR video.]]]]

The following is a simple and accurate guide so that anyone can sound like [[lie|Halo 3's #1 trashtalker]].
*First you should lurk matchmaking until you find a young child, [[you|someone with a speech impediment]], or a [[boxxy|sexually unexposed teenage girl]].  Don't worry about being reported, [[unwarranted self importance|you're famous]] so Microsoft can't ban [[you]]!
*Next you will want to insult your targets entire team based on their color as chosen automatically and randomly by the Halo Matchmaking System.  If they are the red team call them names such as Elmo [[fluffer|Fluffers]], Tomato Fuckers, or [[Furries]].  Similarly, the Blue Team can be called Smurfs, Blue Dildoes, or other [[unfunny]] shit.  As long as it is overflowing with profanity and high volume it is sure to be a success.
*Make sure your target has their microphone plugged in, because now it has become time to make fun of their gamertag.  That's right, [[sarcasm|every gamers highest pride and joy is their gamertag so the most epic lulz can be achieved by making fun of it.]]
*Your target [[WTF|will realize how epically they have been trolled]] and will try to retort.  By now the game will undoubtedly have started, and you should begin betraying them mercilessly.
*From this point, you will want to speak loudly and incoherently so that nobody can understand what the fuck your victim is saying.  This accomplishes a definite win in the dispute and leads to the final conclusion.
*Pretend to start betraying them and instead, let them betray you.  Ask them a [[retard|clever]] question to get them to say the word boot before you boot them from the game.

[[lie|'''Congratulations, you are not one of Halo's best shit talkers.''']]

===Keemstar Nation===
[[Nerd|Keemstar Nation]] is the unclever name DJ gave to his fans.  [[Children|The demographic who find him relateable]] grew up with out a [[Pedo Bear|father figure]] to [[pwn]] any trash talker they encountered over XBOX Live.  They found a troll with many youtube views and decided to follow him until their balls dropped and they [[Fap|found something better to do]].  [[Fact|Every KKK Nation member can't handle bad things being said by their diety.]]  The most common reaction to anything short of [[Hivemind|Keemstar-worship]] is attempting to [[VIP|vandalize ED: a stupid and pointless thing to try]].  Half of the time DJ says he does everything for his fans, and the other half of the time he claims he does it for the money.  This raises much confusion as he has never done much of anything apart from ranting and posting gameplay videos on youtube like everyone else who can type in a webpage URL.  Should you tune into his Blog TV channel, you will undoubtedly hear him rambling about how he brightens every [[emo]] [[faggots]] day, being the [[retard|clever]] [[troll]] that he is.

[[You]] can troll Keemstar Nation at [http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=101744406553067 this URL].

===pwnd? PWND!===
Before DJ was dick riding everyone in machinima, and only had around 15,000 subscribers, he had to figure out a way to get more famous on the [[internet]]. DJ had spammed [[shit nobody cares about|trash talking fights]] fights to establish himself as a champion to his band of cheering retards, so when he scored an audience with [[Loser|some MLG trashtalker named Walshy]], he thought he had convinced the world that he was, in fact, [[Srs bsns]].  This video amassed many views as all the [[faggots]] who worship DJ thought he [[pwnd]] MLG.  Not long after the videos release, his camera man uploaded an unedited version of the video showing that it was in fact someone with a [[Script Kiddies|modded]] gamertag being talked through the video and agreeing to be publicly [[pwnd]]. This caused much [[butthurt]] to all of the F@G and [[lulz]] among the [[fanboys]].  It appeared, and so it was, that they had been [[PWND]].

===Artistically Trolled===
DJ is extremely proud of his [[Shit|fabulous]] [[youtube]] channel.  It has viewers in the [[fact|thousands]].  But most of all he's proud of his [[BlogTV]] banner whom he paid a professional for. [[fact|I'm not shitting you]], this egomaniac [[Guido]] paid some [[Britfag]] designer who has skills in [[nothing|flash]] that could be comprised within an afternoon of wanking and basic tutorials.  You can view the immense amount of suck [http://blogbanners.weebly.com/dj-keemstar.html here]. Of course it's understandable as to why DJ would pay someone to create shit for him and thus getting ripped off like the idiot he is, he's too busy streaming his live show, because after all. Only he knows how to do what everyone else can do.

===Butthurt Rage===
[[Image:Djcreampoop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Final_solution|"I'm Getting A New IP Address".]]]]
With his shitty youtube videos multiplying like rabbits and treating every Halo player he encountered like shit, it was only a matter of time before someone with a sense of [[lulz]] came after him.  Many of his accounts were [[hacked]], and he started [[PMS]]ing to the people who stole them.  The [[Script_kiddies|hackers]] were able to obtain his IP address from joining an XBOX game with him and would use it to hostboot him all day on his streams.  One result of this was him becoming hilariously paranoid about playing games with random fans.  After much [[baw|B'AWWWWWWW]] and [[rage]], [[sarcasm|he got them back in the absolute best way possible.]] He made a youtube video.

[[Last Thursday]] [[Indigo Children|Bungie Studios]] had a nasty virus in their system.  The F@G wasted no time in taking advantage of said glitch and stealing Halo: Reach Beta codes several days before it's [[lie|public]] release.  [[faggot|DJ]] promptly put in his beta code, despite his account being <s>shutdown</s> <s>locked</s> BANHAMMERED at the time, to play Halo: Reach with all of the people who were privileged enough to receive a Beta code '''legitimately'''.  DJ immediately began betraying people left and right [[sarcasm|like the team player he is]] until he pissed off someone [[fact|who was a bigger name than he, f1stdacuffs]] (another no name Machinima director [[amiright]]?).

DJ became [[butthurt]] because Machinima would not let him upload the video of [[Wigger|f1stdacuffs]] betrayal, and so began their petty youtube [[rage]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMOk-wxagLs battle] like the [[Kids on the internet|immature assholes]] they both are.  DJ made an unfunny parody character of [[Wigger|f1stdacuffs]] whom he gave the [[unfunny]] name [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQB4Y1GapXA f1stdabutts].  He wasted no time getting back at the [[loser]] like the [[butthurt]] [[faggot]] he is.

===Trolling DJ===
*<s>Tell him you're going to hack his gamertag.</s>
*<s>DDoS him after getting his IP from matchmaking.</s>
*<s>Call him and tell him you will report his ass to the police for being a pedophile/douche bag/homo.</s>
*<s>Say his 2 year old daughter is a slut</s>
*<s>Ask if his girls pussy is as loose as it was in middle school.</s>
*It doesn't matter WHAT YOU SAY! He will [[RAGE]] over anything!

===Get Hacked===
This all happened in early 2010, so all you [[Noobs|newfags]] in F@G might not remember. DJ got [[hacked]] [[over 9000|countless times]] over his shitty pathetic lifespan, and these don't include the times that [[Script kiddies|kiddies called up Xbox LIVE Support to get his account temporarily locked]]. Some of the [[internet tough guy|internet tough guys]] who had fun hacking him were:
*[[Cracker|VV3AsOne]] is a legit [[hacker]] who got DJ's accounts on a bunch of social networks.
*[[Faggot|The Most Regal]] sold the IP and password database of all 1,250 of his fans in April, '10 when he quit.
*Frosty [[Prank call|called the fuck out of DJ's phone]] and DJ answered it during his live stream, [[proof|proof that it was his number.]]
*[[Fat|Young Maxwell]] told DJ a [[Zune|secret way of getting his gamertag unbanned]], [[lulz|knowing that he would change the gamertag and get it banned]], it was a [[success]]. [[DJ KEEMSTAR#DJ Vs. XBL-Enforcement Team|Stepto]] found out and the [[DJ KEEMSTAR#Dox|gamertag]] DJ KEEMSTAR is [[Raped|forever invalid]].{{clear}}


'''Notable Hackers that fucked up keemstar:'''


'''Vv3AsOne'''
One of the many hackers who successfully [[rape|raped]] DJ's internet connection, [[DJ KEEMSTAR#BlogTV Show|BlogTV stream]], LIVE account, [[YouTube]] profile, and Yahoo! in April '10 and forced him to buy a $549 Virtual Private Server.  VV3AsOne is a notorious Xbox Live hacker who took an interest in fucking DJ's shit. Not too much is known about this [[internet tough guy]]. 

However on a cumstain level, we know that he:
* Hacked DJs [[Twitter]].
* Perma-banned his [[facebook]].
* Got himself AssholeGamers.com Account/[[Mod]] privileges
* [[Goatse|Goatse'd]] Keemstar.com
* Shared the [[youtube]] channel, and helped upload a [[over 9000|shitload]] to it.
* [[Hacked]] his Machinima account, he had to get a brand new contract.
* Has [[dox]] on DJ flowing in a constant stream out of his arsehole.
* Recently found [[Hack|an exploit]] on the filmon.com server which allowed him to steal disc space/bandwidth in the gigs in a matter of minutes.

After it was discovered, he created a curl script, and released it opensource. It lasted about 1 hour before alki discovered that he had taken around 10 gigs of disc space, and 30 gigs of bandwidth with it.

And who could forget how he [[ddos|hit him offline]] while streaming for about 1 month almost everyday in a constant quest for teh [[lulz]].
{{clear}}


'''The Most Regal'''
DJ's next unlucky web dude was named The Most Regal who has so far had the longest consecutive run of being tortured by DJ in his [[Harry Potter#Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets|basement of secrets]], 3 months to be exact. Regal bought keemstarnation.com, djkeemstar.com, and haloderanker.com, and took over on federationofassholegamers.com. Regal is the one who turned DJ into what he is today; [[Sarcasm|a respectable and generous human being]]. When Regal showed DJ [[obvious|how to get google ads on the websites]] ([[doing it wrong|DJ spelled it 'websight']]), DJ went batshit crazy on making sure his [[personal army]] spam clicked everything. DJ quit his job, due to the income this generated, about $250 per day. He gave a quarter to Regal and kept a quarter, but said he reinvested the other half when [[fact|he actually blew it on cigarettes and sex toys for his <s>wife</s> <s>girlfriend</s>]] [[cumdumpster]].

Eventually Regal and DJ got in fights due to Regal being just as much of a money grubbing Jew except with [[moar]] [[IQ]].  He would make the [[faggot|f@ggot]] look like a [[newfag|newf@g]] on his own live stream.  It wasn't long before Regal got bored of being DJs [[BDSM]] whore and wanted to do something for the [[lulz]].  He was given a [[moderator]] position on DJ's [[lie|popular]] BlogTV stream. Regals [[troll face]] immediately came out and he banned hundreds of people including DJ's IP address and changed the background to [[Miley Cyrus]] pics, forcing DJ to [[ragequit]] [[OVER 9000]] times. Consequences were never the same, because Regal decided to delete the site with 1,250 members on it.  [[MOAR|The lulz didn't end there]]!  He took the databases which had everyones IP addresses and passwords to accounts, and started [[hacking]] whomever crossed his path, officially pwning the entirety of the f@ggots.

===DJ Vs. XBL-Enforcement Team=== 
[[Image:Steptomsn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Disappoint|DJ I AM DISAPPOINT]]]]
[[Last Thursday]], DJ woke up one morning to turn on the good old [[Xbox|Xbox]]. At that given moment his gamer-tags started to get [[banned|locked]] and were under investigation by Microsoft. DJ was in RAAAAAAEG mode over this, especially when he found out trolls were calling in [[XBox Live|Xbox-live]] 
and reporting the gamertags belong to themselves and were hacked. The F@G community went under a brief moment of panic and became very [[Butthurt|butthurt]]. As DJ was yelling in his mic on the live stream, the chatters started spamming up a shitstorm as usual. 
The solution? 
*Make a [[youtube|Youtube]] video.
*Call up all the [[12-year-old boys|F@G fan boys.]]
*Give a [[Boring|dramatic]] speech that the world is [[bullshit|ending.]] 
*Gather his army of delusional fans who think [[lie|they can change how the world works]].
*Tell them to call up Microsoft and do the same thing to other people's gamertags as well.
	After the so called storm on Xbox-live had finished, and the world had changed according to Keemstar,
Xbox-live changed their policy so people wouldn't be so easily social engineered again. The fan boys popped boners and were all treated to a speech saying that if it weren't for the fans none of this would of happened, "20 dollars
paypal to flagmyvids@gmail.com". Well, during the phone calls the F@G fans made to [[Tech Support|Xbox live support]], one of the [[Moderator|mods]] of the 
live show reported that his gamertag was hacked and he went under the name of [[winrar|WingsofRedemption]] which happens
to be a popular name amongst the gaming community, and a victim of [[shit nobody cares about|Keemstars rise to fame]] to get more attention. WingsOfRedemption didn't want to take anymore of DJ's faggotry and wanted to end him once and for all. Wings proceeded to
tell other big Machinima directors and Machinima itself the truth behind DJ and how much of a Jew he really is. Keemstar got wind of the situation and made a butthurt Youtube video. As he continued to call him out, Wings became very nervous
of DJ and his fans as they have a reputation for [[raid|raiding]] and shutting down YouTube channels. To cover his own ass, Wings called up the gods of Xbox-live and showed everything that was wrong with DJ KreamlovingFaggot.
	 
Nothing happened for a couple of days. Eventually, Xbox-live Enforcement Team got attention of the situation and began to view Haloahole's videos on Youtube. The Xbox-Live Gods were [[I am disappoint|very disappointed to see the faggotry that was taking place]] on their motha' fuckin' networks. The almighty Microsoft raised it's ban hammer for the [[over 9000|9000th]] time and thus, Deranker, 2 Bucks, DJ, and DJ's fake robot account would all have to be transferred to a brand new console. Of course, DJ accomplished this by begging for money on the live stream.  What DJ didn't know is that [[lulz|the enforcement team was monitoring the show and banning whatever account he violated the rules of Xbox-live on]]. The head of the Xbox-live enforcement team known as Stepto was the main individual banning/suspending DJ's gamertags therefore making Stepto a God amongst all the people who [[haters|hate]] and despise Keemstar and what he is doing on the Internets. Keemstar began raging even more andthreatened Stepto with legal action claiming his retarded [[retard|inbred brother]] is a [[E-lawyer|lawyer]] and would pick up on the case. Now DJ's big plan is to sue Microsoft thinking he can collect his Jew gold on the damages of so-called "harassment". The stupid [[guido]] fuck [[retard|forgot to read the Xbox-Live Code of Conduct and Terms of Use every single time he agreed to them]].  [[ironic|Hey now, DJ does know what he's talking about, since his last job was to use scare tactics into getting people to pay off debts]] they owed to the [[Government|government.]] Helpless as DJ is the only thing he has is his fans, who are all 13 and under or just [[Insane|batshit crazy]] in the head to believe his [[liar|lies]] or just plain dumb since DJ even says "fuck the fans" trying to be the next Kurt Cobain when in fact he can't even handle fifty thousand subscriptions on Youtube and only half of those subs watch the bullshit this guy makes.
	
Being the [[lolcow]] he is, DJ called his [[X is not your personal army|personal army]] onto the live stream telling them to spam Steptos [[twatter|Twitter]] and mention [[Bill Gates|Bill Gates]] thinking anybody would give a rat's ass about him. Around four hundred [[13-year-old boy|fans]] from the live stream began the spam and then became bored within 30 minutess and quit. It didn't stop there!  DJ called up his good Youtube pal, Ishatonu who actually has somewhat of an intelligent fan base, and began to explain the situation by saying Microsoft is harassing him and banning his accounts because he's gay.  The [[Homosexuality|gay]] jokes wouldn't stop coming from DJ, which brought about many [[lulz]] because Stepto
is a flaming homosexual [[IRL]]. DJ began begging Shat to make a video for his fans to get in the live show and take part in the situation. Shat didn't want any part of this, so Shat did DJ a favor by making a thread on [[/b/|/b/]] making it seem like DJ was asking for a personal army of anons to help.  Once DJ saw the thread he began to get wet thinking [[Anonymous|anonymous]] would be his personal army, and the thread proceeded and the common answer from anon was "not your personal army". Trolls began to drop DJ's dox taking full advantage of a back raid. DJ being the [[Epic Fail Guy|fail guy]] that he is watched the thread and stated that only three people were repeating the same stuff over and over thinking anon would never try to harm him since he brought up a good word about them on the live stream and even made a freestyle days before saying anony anony anony over and over again like [[Fat Larry's Band|LilWayne.]] The thread 404d and DJ helplessly had nothing else better to do then to ramble on and on like he does when he's not raging or begging for money.

To add even more [[lulz]] icing on the [[bawwwww]] cake, DJ is under the assumption that Stepto is purposely without reason harassing him, [[Truth|when in fact by creating each account with the purpose to troll and cause drama over Xbox-Live, he's violating Xbox-Live's code of conduct. Due to his and F@G's repeated offenses that he streams publicly for all to see, he's setting himself up for the ban hammer.]] The [[NO|shit coaster isn't over yet]]as he announces he will [[LULZ|sue]] Stepto for taking away his [[First Amendment|"right to free speech"]], unknowing to DJ, he doesn't realize that Stepto is a part of [[Microsoft]], and can't be sued solely. He'd be suing [[Microsoft]] [[FACT|which has as much chance of winning as DJ has of getting laid.]] 

Now that DJ and F@G have caught [[The Man|Xbox-Live Enforcement's]] attention, F@G should no doubt [[WIN|end in]] a [[lulzy]] demise.

===Lulzy Demise===
Thanks to the efforts of those with a sense of [[lulz]], and a little help from [[/b/]], DJ had received much harassment.  His [[IRL]] Dox had been found out, and advertised for all of [[4chan]] and [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] to see.  Because of their efforts, the Xbox LIVE [[moderators]] had stumbled across his [[fail]] and gotten on his case.  It was only a matter of time before the shit hit the fan.
<center>[[File:FAGIsDone.png]]</center>
<s>On August 24, 2010</s> [[Last Thursday]], DJ KEEMSTAR gave up on fighting live and announced the end of F@G. He played one last game on the Blogtv stream, which ended with another [[banhammer]]. He gave a last goodbye, and then removed moderator privileges from everyone.  All of the fanboys proceeded to become horribly [[butthurt]] because they couldn't power trip with the $20 they gave him.  A fanboy by the name of Jew decided to retract around 2000 dollars from DJ's Paypal, making the account go [[Depression|negative]], and frozen. With a negative Paypal account, and his moniez all gone, DJ was forced to return to work as a [[sarcasm|librarian]] or else make his [[Porn|1 year old daughter]] homeless.

It seems Dj's sexual robot slave is going to the [[PS3]], [[Truth|not like he'll find that many people with a mic to troll anyway.]]However, Dj has later announced that he will be not quitting, and that he and the rest of F@G, such as Denigger, Fagbot, and 2 Cocks will continue making videos, and instead of wreaking havoc, they decided they are going to take clips of halo players becoming LOL RAGE and send them to xbox, basically becoming their hookers. DJ has acquired a new [[BDSM|ass slave]] by the name of bluepoint951, who has agreed to handle his [[paypal]],a classic ironic move by DJ [[Moderator|putting all his trust in a completely incompetent stranger]], cock sucking ensues between these two between streams.

===You're Fired & I'm Lawing the Law Down!===

On October 30, 2010, DJ accused bluepoint951 of stealing his money and fucking with the [[paypal]] when it was nearly time to pay his bills. His [[whore|girlfriend]] had recently [[Break up|quit his dick]] for not being able to make enough money to pay any, thereby forcing her out of the kitchen and into the real world. In an attempt to "create" entertainment out of being [[Buttsecks|fuck'd in the asshole]] by a vagina and his online accountant, DJ convinced the [[hivemind]] that they were the victim of thought control from bluepoint951, [[ironically]]. Apparently bluepoint961 had been planning a mutiny with several other Moderators to overthrow DJ from his fictional seat of power. [[Extreme Advertising|BUT WAIT]] he was also having a gay [[Pedophilia|online relationship]] with an underage blogTV user by the name of crossfaaade. DJ's claim of proof of this supposed relationship was a [[fan sign]] that bluepoint951 had where crossfaaade was in the picture.

Over the next several days in early November, DJ accused bluepoint951's squadron as a stream full of [[trolls]] who had betrayed him and were trying to ruin his show. He then proceeded to "fire" several mods and "law the law down" on the rest of his stream. DJ attempted to send several of his [[cocksucker| best moderators and fans]] as spies to watch for an "attack" from bluepoint951's blogTV stream; however, nothing of the sort succeeded and the attempt to "troll the trolls" failed. As everyone on bluepoint951's stream discovered as the days past, "DJ is right 100% of the time always" and "will one day be on G4 TV" a true monument to his glory; you can see these conversations [http://dj-keemstar.tk at this URL].

===Guy's Show Some Respect, [[Brother|Chuck]] is Dead===
On November 4, 2010 at 6:30PM EST DJ announced that he was going to be sponsored by [[porn|FilmOn.com]] and that he would never need any more [[welfare|donations]] from his [[12-year-old_boys|viewers]].  To celebrate his increased sell-out status, was going to give [[shit|valuable]] items away for free.  Namely one of his many [[b&|banned]] [[Xbox 360]] Slims.

{{Quote|So what if it's banned?! You're getting a LEGENDARY XBOX!!|DJ KEEMSTAR [[Fap|masturbating]] to a picture of himself}}

The site began to get [[DDoS|mass amounts of views]] from fans spamming the [[Special]] link.  DJ, being his [[Douchbag|usual]] self, started gloating about how his [[fiction|fame]] crashed the website.  This faggotry went on for about an hour until the creator of FilmOn.com, [[Oldfag|Alki David]], called DJ and told him that [[User:Vv3AsOne|Vv3AsOne]] and friends had been [[DDoS|DDoSing]] the fuck out of him via an [[exploit]] that skull-fucks [[bandwidth]].  [[Oldfag|Alki]] was quick to assure DJ that the [[Cyber police|police]] had been contacted and [[Lie|the perpetrators had been arrested]].  Not long after, DJ was playing [[Xbox Live]] as usual until he received a phone call. He returned to the show to announce that [[Bullshit|he had just learned of a death in the family]]. [[Lawyer|Chuck Keem]], his [[Fake|brother]], had just entered [[necrophilia]] territory.  After announcing the death, some other f@ggot became co-host of the show as DJ went [[AFK|away from keyboard]] to [[baw]]. After announcing his brothers [[Bullshit|"death"]], he told his slave bit [[Moderators|moderators]] to link to a bot site, by entering their e-mail address information and selling their e-mails overseas, allowing access to all his [[slaves|fans]] credit information until his blogtv show was hacked and shutdown by a troll streaming  [[gay]] [[pron]] on 11/16/2010.

[[DJ KEEMSTAR#Dox|We recommend calling him to <s>give your condolences</s> laugh at him.]]

===Brb, Cyber Police===
On November 19, the [[Redneck|Holland New York police department]] was [[Awesomeface|cleverly deceived]] by someone who DJ claims to be MiZ Fr0sTi (his greatest [[cumdumpster]] [[Scientology|nemesis]]), but was probably just [[anon]], called [[BrokeNCYDE|the pigs]] and claimed to be a deaf person [http://www.wivb.com/dpp/news/erie/Deaf-persons-call-turns-out-to-be-hoax being held hostage in a bathroom at DJ's address].  The police were also told that DJ was wearing a [[Lolwut|razor blade necklace]] and was about to [[an hero]].  Being relatively [[virgin|unexposed]] to trolling, the police could not simply say [[lol internet]].  They dispatched a SWAT team and several police cars in order to save the hearing impaired from having to bathe in the Keem residence.  DJ was out having a smoke when the cops arrived and [[lulz|held him at gunpoint]].  His wife and 1 year old daughter were next out of the house, and it was around this time that DJ realized that he was being [[trolled]].  His response was the same as always: [[X Y is X|make a youtube video]], display a massive case of [[victim complex]], and tell the internet that [[Jessi Slaughter|YA DUN GOOF'D]].

===The Epidemic Returns===
January 18, 2011, after three months of hiatus and making extremely shitty videos they called "[[cp|classics]]", F@G declared it is coming back. This of course means that DJ Keemstar and [[dildos|company]] will make videos yelling at [[13 year old boys]] and stroking their [[e-peen]]. They will be terribly [[unfunny]] unless you haven't hit puberty. In their debut video DJ Keemstar pulls out one of his [[dicks|dumb ass personalities]], DJ Redneck. He tries really hard to troll a kid but he, once again, makes himself look [[fact|stupid as hell]]. Notice the kid doesn't even rage or give a fuck. Kumstain goes as far as making fun of the kid saying he was bad; but the [[faggot]] did worse than him.

{{Quote|[[newfag|I got through Chris Hansen, I got through Chris Hansen, what bitch...]]|DJ Keemstar confirming he is a [[pedo]]}}

No matter what the dumbass does, his persistent [[faggotry]] will [[gg|gain additional haters and troll's attentions]].
