The '''Giant Isopod''' ''Bathynomus giganteus'' is the physical embodiment of [[awesome]].  They are closely related to sow bugs, and live >9000 feet under the sea.  [[Last Thursday|Some time ago]], a pic of these critters devouring their natural prey, the Dorito,  was posted in a blog OL and an [[internet phenomenon|internets phenomenon]] was born.

==Everyone <3 Isopod==

The Doritopod pic was spammed all over blogs and forums, garnishing both [[WTF|amazement]] and [[This looks shopped|disbelief]], although many people thought they were looking at the remnants of the world's tackiest lobster dinner.  [[Lusers]] made Giant Isopod fanart, t-shirts, and wrote songs dedicated to them, because the internet really [[Basement dwellers|doesn't have anything better to do]].
