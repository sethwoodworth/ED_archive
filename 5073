'''MP3''' is an audio compression format which replaced wav and aiff around the web 1.0 era. it can squeeze the fuck out of your random sound recordings of you, your friends, your unfunny jokes or your singing friends. With their small size, they can easily be shared on the [[Internets]], which eventually resulted in [[internet law|lawsuits]] from the [[RIAA]]. Just seed MOAR.

[[Audiophile]]s and [[DJ]]s enjoy whining and complaining about how poor the quality of MP3 files are - how certain frequencies are distorted, and how awful the compression artifacts sound. [[Apple]] uses an AAC compression format that is touted to be of higher quality. Most people cannot tell the difference between CD audio and MP3s, especially when it's encoded at a  compression rate higher than the 128kbps standard and played on shitty computer speakers. A lot of audio on the [[internets]] is thus encoded at 160 and 196kbps [[for great justice|for higher fidelity]]. However, the bit rate needed to make [[Insane Clown Posse]] sound "high fidelity" is estimated to be infinity ([[Shit nobody cares about|1411kb/s, actually]]).

=== Ogg Vorbis ===
There is another sound compression format called Ogg Vorbis. It's unencumbered by [[shit nobody cares about|patents and features flexible comment headers and compression]] that's [[lie|superior to that of MP3]]. It's also complete and utter [[crap]]. The only people who like '''.ogg''' files are wankers [[earrape|who don't care about sound quality]] and/or are too fucking lazy to [[seed]] their [[snatch]]es on [[private tracker]]s. This is an easy troll to use against both of the Vorbis supporters out there. All in all, [[Troll|It's not widely used. There must be a reason.]]
