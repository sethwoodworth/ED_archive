/i/

Although [[Jews did WTC|Conspiracy theories]] state outherwise, this is not /i/, the [[4chan]] Oekaki board, '''/i/''' is the floating location where [[Shit|Ebaumsworld]] plots many raids, and then pins it on [[Anonymous]] [[for the lulz|for some reason]]. Four out of five [[Science|dentists]] agree the majority of the internet's lulz originate from /i/. An individual involved in this board would be called an /i/nsurgent, an /i/nvader, a v/i/rgin , or an /i/nfidel. The group as a whole was called the /i/ntifada.

=An History=

==The formation of /i/==

[[Image:RaidChart.gif|thumb|The official raid flowchart.]]

Invasions were often a subject of interest for the [[B|/b/tards]] at 4chan. Threads about some DeviantART, [[Habbo Hotel]] or a certain child named [[an hero|Mitch]] would often become classics. On the events of August 23, 2006, dubbed [[b/day|/b/day]] by the /b/tards, the administrator of 4chan, [[Moot|moot]], condemned invasions to be against the rules. This started the revolution of /b/day, where [[7chan]] emerged as a new alternative to 4chan's totalitarian state.

7chan contained a board dubbed /i/, for invasions. It first contained many [[stickam]] raids, [[Tom Green]] call-ins that were usually started by namefags "Rofltron Jebus" and "IvanTheCat", and Habbo raids. It then grew in size with the amount of victories it achieved, and was the main setting for [[Legion]] to plot its raids.

==Personal Army==

Because of /i/'s success, it soon became a beacon for people wishing to settle personal [[V|vendettas]]. Being dumped by a [[Whore|girlfriend]] or a person [[Anonymous]] doesn't like, was the usual story. These were often ignored by Anonymous, and met with the response, "/i/ is [[Not_your_personal_army|not your personal army]]", or, simply, NYPA.

==The fall of 7/i/==
As a certain side effect of the [[Hal Turner]] raids, 7chan gained a lot of publicity ''(see [[Internet Hate Machine]] and [[Fox News]])''. This was brought to the attention of [[ian]]'s datacenter, and /i/'s actions were found to infringe upon the [[TOS]]. 7chan was allowed to continue operation, but /i/ was forced to close down. This action was regarded by 7/b/ to be a new /b/day, or possibly even the end of 7chan. The reflex action of the /b/tards was to go to a new /i/ at a more concealed place, [[420chan|with the burnouts and pedos]]. After around half a year of [[420chan]] housing /i/, 420chan was taken down for an entirely unrelated reason; /i/ was without a central command. 

On a side note, 7chan has since switched hosting, but decides to replicate [[4chan|failchan]]'s totalitarian state, as 7chan is now run by a bunch of [[faggots]].

/i/ later returned with 420chan only to be taken over by fear of [[moralfag|"moralfags"]]. The moralfag (also referred to as a "protestfag") was a new breed of [[newfag]] that was born as a direct result of [[Project Chanology]] shifting its focus from attacking Scientology websites to doing IRL protests against them. The moralfags would viciously oppose/prevent committing internet-based /i/nvasions against the [[Scifags]], fearing that such activity would villanize anonymous further and discourage ordinary people from joining their protests. True /b/tards saw through this [[faggotry]] and convinced many /i/nsurgants to raid themselves. A DDOS occurred on 4-12-08 after floods of cute rabbits, otters, and kitties. It was affectionately dubbed the Rabbit Raid.

==Following Activity==
Many different IRC channels and [[List of *chan boards|smaller imageboards]] plotted raids during the time after 420chan was [[V&]]. Among them were partyvan.org, or [[lulznet]], where certain /i/nsurgents committed a /b/tard sin, and successfully DDOSed [[4chan]].org, in what was called [[The Caturday Nap]]. After the Caturday Nap and [[brb_soup|brb, soup]], both long periods of time where 4chan and 7chan were down, [[711chan]] became a major chan and hosted an invasion imageboard. The most active invasion board on a chan was [[711chan]] /i/. On January 5, 2008 it was announced that [[Kirtaner]] from 420chan would be moving /i/ back to it's old location during the [[Subeta]] raids, merged with 711.

/i/ at this time was a fairly different place. For one, the [[partyvan]] network was flooded with oper-abusers and fucktards. [[lies|/i/ was also flooded by people who passed CS3 and who now have unimaginable e-hardness.]]

Soon after, 711chan and 420chan split. 420chan no longer had /i/, and 711chan's /i/ appeared weak. [[Freechan]] began to overtake 711chan as the primary [[Ebaums|Anonymous]] /i/, but managed to [[pwn]] itself sometime [[Last Thursday|during October 2008]] and was not seen for nearly eight months. Meanwhile, [[chans]] such as 888chan grew.

=Current Situation=
[[888chan]] did manage to produce the most successful /i/ board seen since [[7chan|7]] and [[420chan]]â€™s, but unfortunately the whole site and its [[insurgen.info|w/i/ki]] seemed to suddenly vanish off the face of the internets around the beginning of [[2010|January 2010]]. 711chan has gone back to being the most active /i/, as we enter a new era of [[fail|mediocrity]] once more. [[RockstarChan]] has the best quality /i/ at the moment.
