Communal journal
{{needsmore|examples}}
A '''communal journal''' is a [[fake journal]] shared by a number of people, usually for [[troll]]ing purposes. Communal journals are good because you can have the same user have multiple [[IP address]]es, and you can gain credibility as an [[IRL]] journal since it is used so much.
