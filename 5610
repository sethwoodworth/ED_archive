[[File:Mysticark_hates.PNG|thumb|TARD RAGEEEE]]
'''[http://mysticark.deviantart.com/ MysticArk]''' ('''[http://armslave1000.deviantart.com/ or Armslave1000]''' or '''[http://titanwarrior.deviantart.com/ TitanWarrior]''') is some mid-20's Texan [[aspie]] that hates just about everyone and everything because he has Asperger's syndrome. He also mourns the cancellations of shitty cartoons as if they were his grandparents, and blames it on [[SpongeBob]] or the corporations behind the networks such as Nick or Cartoon Network. He is also a devout fanboy[http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/110788/how-to-tell-if-youre-a-fanboy/] of {{deviantart|tito-mosquito}} for some reason.

MysticArk, like many others [[tartlet|of his kin]], wishes to be [[unrealistic expectations|a great "retro" animator some day.]] However since he acts (and even types) like [[Chris-chan]] he'll be [[Maddox|bagging groceries]], assuming they'll hire him (they won't).

==Interacting with Others, and on Art==
{{quote|[[Irony|Yeah well, you are an asshole.]]|MysticArk|on interaction.}}<br/>
[[File:MysticArk_rules.png|thumb|right|He hates following others' rules, but you MUST sign this contract before even speaking a word to him.]]

[[File:Mysticark_practice_punish.png|thumb|right|IT'S LIKE BEING PUNISHED.]]

MysticArk feels that his [[Asperger's syndrome]] permits him to get away with damn near anything. He adopts a total [[victim]] role when communicating with others while pawning himself as a martyr to the animation world as well. While he demonstrates some knowledge about storyboards, model sheets, and Adobe Illustrator, his attitude will get him nowhere.

His deviantID has a huge [[tl;dr]] list of rules when talking to him. Since it is [[Xbox|hueg]], you can view here:

{|style="margin: auto;"
|{{frame|{{RoundBoxTop|#DDE5D8|#5D7162}}{{morphquote|mysticark_rules|background-color: #DDE5D8; width: 600px; height: 200px|font-weight: bold;
|1. Absolutely no rude comments to me about what I say. If I see a rude comment in my messages, I WILL block you.
|BLOCK YOU


|2. There will be no arguments with me of any kind, and if you argue with me, you will lose, and you will be blocked instantly!|YOU WILL LOSE


|3.If you can't accept my opinions on certain subjects, regardless of how rude and angry I am about that subject or comment, then you ALL better not start arguing with me or giving me YOUR opinions about them!|YOU MUST ACCEPT ME

|4. I will unblock you only if you formally write an apology message to me, and then I'll see if I want to unblock you or not.|A FORMAL APOLOGY

|5. I SEVERELY hate Mario fans and ALL of his games. If you ALL have a problem with this, then DO NOT even THINK about posting or creating comments asking me why. I WILL NOT tolerate it!! I don't even want to hear the word "MARIO" from any of you!|MARIO IS THE DEVIL

|I will not take any crud from anyone who threatens me or says that my work is awful or from people who cannot accept my opinions peacefully and faithfully!|HYPOCRITE


|REMEMBER: On my account and when YOU are talking to me, its MY WAY... OR THE HIGHWAY!!|Life is a highway...

|Just leave me alone. Please! I had enough from ALL of you people who want to shove the truth down my throat. With me, I don't want to know the truth!|You can't handle the truth!

|I might sound too cruel, but I want to establish law and order on my DeviantArt Account.|[[DUN DUN]]

When confronted with with any sort of conflicting opinion, or if someone posts a comment on his page that isn't 100% ass kissing,  he becomes ultra defensive and utilizes the "block" button faster than a jackrabbit in a wildfire. (quoting SpongeBob to fuck with him, if he reads this!) As seen [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/29792115/1347027146 here,] MysticArk threatened to block someone who pointed out that he was unnecessarily hating on two voice actresses. During the last gasps of his first account, his habit of blocking people for little to no good reason quickly turned to [[lulz]] as his blocklist was completely filled up, leaving the trolls to flame as they liked on his main page. With his penchant for making enemies, his reputation will totally go a long ways in the competitive and ever-busy industry of animation.
 
{{quote|"Nickelodeon... THIS MEANS WAR. If I EVER pitch MY CARTOON to YOUR NETWORK, you all BETTER WATCH OUT FOR ME, because I am going to be an EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE CARTOONIST, and will NEVER repeat, NEVER TAKE "NO" for an ANSWER, and I FORCE YOU TO PUT MY SHOW on a GOOD TIME SLOT, and make sure ALL of the SNOT-NOSED BRATS and FANGIRLS out there LOVE MY SHOW TO A PASSION."|MysticArk, in the same entry as lamenting The Mighty B's cancellation}}

As mentioned, MysticArk has ''some'' amount of knowledge on animation and creating characters, like [[DisneyFan01]] does, but both clearly do not comprehend certain things in art:

[[File:Stillife_by_MysticArk.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Everything is flat in this still life that he made. There is no vanishing point and the Game Boy appears to be floating, as does the cartridge.]]

[[File:The_New_Arrow_of_Justice_by_MysticArk.jpg|thumb|center|500px|This too suffers from no vanishing point, and the floor tiles transform into fucking trapezoids.]]

==Discovery of his ED Article==
[[File:Trololololo.png|thumb|600px|center|HOLY SHIT HIDE HE'S GON GET HIM OR HER also [[flounce]] up in this bitch]]

Upon this article's discovery MysticArk began to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]], escpecially troll comments. So you better screencap that shit before it gets hidden!

He then proceeded to delete all of his journal entries and change his personal information so that he could back up his ridiculous threat of becoming a "[[retard|deviantART mute]]". Then he deleted his account anyway. Way to go, dude.

''Is this the end of our trolling days?! Has MysticArk sworn off the internets forever?!?''

No, of course not. Like all fucking stupid [[asspies]], he thought he could escape the wrath of the Internet by making a new account. Unfortunately, he didn't do a very good job of hiding his identity, as he posted the same stupid shit from his old account. He obviously didn't realize that [[Anonymous]] is a many-headed monster, and when you cut off one of its heads two more emerge in its place spewing [[shit]] and [[Rule 34]]. His [http://armslave1000.deviantart.com/ new account] was already deleted by now.

An [http://ed-sucks.deviantart.com/ account] "ED-Sucks" seems to be a troll.

MysticArk's [http://titanwarrior.deviantart.com/ real account] is "TitanWarrior".
It seems now that the dickweed himself have admitted defeat on his shitty journal: [http://titanwarrior.deviantart.com/journal/35063265/ I'm sorry]. There's also a possibility that maybe he is [[bullshit|trying]] to [[lie|change]] his so called "attitude".
