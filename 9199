Xanga
[[Image:Azn.jpg|right|thumb|Average Xanga user.]]
'''Xanga''' is a [[weblog]] service that seems to be popular with the younger crowd. Though few thought it possible, the creators somehow managed to find [[LiveJournal]] AND [[DeadJournal]] rejects to form an even more vile e-"community". As with [[LiveJournal]], users can post [[comments]] and give e-props (not to be confused with [[e-points]]) to other users' entries.  E-props are an ingenious method of comparing online popularity, also known as e-penis length.

Interestingly enough, Xanga users (colloquially called "Xangans") are primarily [[Azn|Asian]], while LiveJournal users are primarily [[white]]. Race war? We hope so.

Xangas also help to perpetuate not actually talking to anyone. Most Xanga users never leave their room, unless going to empty their pepsi bottles filled with urine.

==The front page==

It isn’t a ‘new’ feature but it’s fairly new to the Xanga site itself compared to any other blogging service. Now there is a front page that you see every time you go to log in featuring xangans entries and entries submitted to the site to be on the front page for everyone to see upon logging in. The front page is where you’ll find, [[unfunny]], [[classy]], sometimes [[lulzy]] entries created by ‘ish’ sites or submitted by actual Xanga users. What you’ll typically see on the front page is: ‘How to lose weight’ ‘What foods will make you [[fat]]’ Which celebrity pulled this off the best?’ '[[Twilight]] vs (any other thing that doesn't make sense like Phantom of the opera or [[Anne rice]])‘Why can't I get a date?’ 'I'M TOTALLY BISEXUAL GUYZ' 'Why are these so expensive?' ‘What does God think of..’ and luzly lists featured by users about fashion or things that bother or annoy them…Discussions of [[pro-ana]] and eating disorders seem to [[rape]] the front page along with ‘healthy thoughts’ tips on beauty, motherhood or [[religion]]. Anything and everything from ‘useful’ information to deep, [[emo|insightful]] thoughts for real people that people ACTUALLY care about their topics closely.


==How to get on the front page==
Generally if you don’t submit your [[shit|thought provoking]] post to a site or xanga your site has to be recommended by users. The more ‘rec’s you get the more you’ll see yourself on the front page. The same people get on the front page nearly every day and no one has anything to say that’s actually worth reading, let alone if you leave a comment there is no chance the OP will post back to you and everyone says the exact same thing that you say, so you’re fucked if you don’t end up on the first page of comments. Also it takes a lot of ass kissing to get your entry on the front page.


==How to troll xanga==
1. Make a fake blog
<br>
2. Comment randomly on pages 
<br>
3. Troll the front page with anything, someone will take offense to it and reply back to you
<br>
4. Continue to troll the front page until you're banned from them
<br>
5. ?????
<br>
6. [[PROFIT!]]


==Xangan Behavior==
Here is an actual xanga comment, because there is simply no way to inject more [[lulz]] than are already present:

==Fun With Xanga==
Xanga recently added a 'footprints' feature, allowing users to see not only exactly who visted their site, but ''where'' they were visiting from. Some saw this as pointless, as [[at least 100]] members already had independent tracker software, but the ability to see the source of their pages link added a whole new aspect of fun. [http://www.xanga.com/HappyCorpse/517605811/oh-xanga-how-i-love-to-manipulate-you.html Some members]  found that this could be manipulated to the advantage of [[troll]]s: Type in random shit into the blog search, click every page that comes up, sit back, and enjoy the reactions of people who see that their site was referred to by "Animals fucking [[tubgirl]] pictures" in the search engine. [[lulz|Lulz]] guaranteed.
