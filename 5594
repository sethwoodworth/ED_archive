'''My Love For Yuna''' (aka ''[[MILF|MLFY]], [[Faggot|Judith]], [[Naruto|Sosuke Aizen]], [[Yiffstar|Whalelover]], [[bestiality|ifuckwhales]], [[Weeaboo|Aznsishawtt]], [[omg|omgzorzrepnao]], [[Furry|My Love for Whales]]'') is a member of [http://www.FinalFantasyForums.net FinalFantasyForums.net]. He is known for constantly annoying and harassing other members begging them for rep points to inflate his e-cock. He also enjoys stalking member's photoshop threads and spamming them with useless posts such as '''OMGORZ NICE WORK THERE. I +REP YOU REP BACK PL0X.'''  MLFY also believes that black people polluted the ocean and the asian people go blind when they laugh, this is hugely ironic as MLFY spent his first few weeks in the community harassing the two hawt azn admins. He also claims that any wrong done by him on the forums was done by his brother who ties him up in his room and takes his laptop. MLFY has a very unhealthy whale fetish, the members of FinalFantasyForums.net tried to help him with treatment for this, but alas it could not be helped, he just loved the whales too darned much...

== History on FinalFantasyForums ==

MLFY joined FFF on August 25, 2008, and from that point annoyed everyone in sight. He began to hit on the hawt azn admins, and cause annoyance in general for all the members he encountered. His name was often confused with [[MILF]] Which lead to some serious lulz, until he changed his name to Judith, when the members all started mistaking him for their grandmothers. Soon afterward he became Sosuke Aizen, and went on about cleaning materials such as [[Bleach]] and he blended in with the other members for a while until his inner [[retard]] came out and he went back to his former annoying self.
His age is disputed on his own profile, when he registered he listed his birthdate as August 13, 1993, yet in his biography he states: "I look Like Sosuke Aizen and I have a love for Yuna. I am 19 years old and live in Some unknown place. Yuna is my love!!!"

MFLY has recently been banned from the shoutbox on FFF for posting racist material. He has stated however that it was not him, that his evil brother tied him up, locking him in his room and stole his computer in an attempt to ruin his credibility on the forums. The mods, understandably did not believe a word of this and Shoutbox banned him, only to be private messaged by him repeatedly begging them to let him back in. He's notorious on the forums for begging for rep on FFF, which he believes can inflate his incredibly small e-[[cock]], but he is sadly mistaken. He wishes to inflate said e-cock in a fultile attempt to satisfy his whale lovers, all of whom say sex with MLFY leaves much to be desired [[Image:Erotic same sex couple-BDSM soft.jpg||thumb|left|MLFY's and his brother... locked in the closet indeed...]]
MLFY also seems to have an attraction to little girls as well as to whales and Yuna, as he has made comments to members who posts pics of themselves with their families how cute their children and such. He also adamantly denies his love for whales, but there is epic proof of his whalesexing. MLFY has been known to stalk several hawt FFF members, and he tends to stare at them while they sleep

{{quote| this is the game I have been waiting for ever since and I am getting it right when it comes out. Oh and that looks like a lesbian scene but actually Faize is a guy. Lol Ill rep ye for this when I can. Sadly its exclusive for 360 only.|An example of two things, 1) MLFY's retardedness, 2) His rep-whoring obsession.}}
{{quote|OMG................... Your little girl is so cute!!! Ummmm I am shocked. Beautiful as always. Great pics.|MLFY's little girl obsession strikes again.}}
{{quote|I really look like Tidus guys I even get it at school. Well I guess it was me kissing Yuna in macalania lol. Anyways I love Yuna!!!!!!!|MLFY's introductory thread on FinalFantasyForums.net... As mentioned earlier he felt as though he looked like Sosuke Aizen, a shapeshifter, perhaps?}}
 
{{quote| My face hey stop being Mean alright because I regret all that shit I said to ye in the past. That was all shit what I said alright and I freakin regret it. Oh and you know what you banned me from the shoutbox but it was actually my brother who got me banned. He was using my account to get me banned on purpose. Plz understand it was not my fault at all.|More excuses...}}

{{quote|I need to pull it out against a hot girl.| WTF?}}

{{quote|I am 19. Plz do not start the No your 15 thing.|Suuuure....}}

== Yuna ==
MLFY claims to be in love with this here little bint, but recent research has proven that his love actually is for the whales, he mimics these creatures in search of a mate, alas so far he has been unsucessful, if you can't sex a whale, you've got no chance. [[image:"Yuna".jpg|thumb|left|This is "'''''Yuna'''''"]]Another theory claims that possibly he wishes to create a Yuna/Whale hybrid, being that these mammals are fewking huge and that[[image:Yuna.jpg|thumb|right|This is the real Yuna, do you want her now?]] Yuna is a bunch of pixels that task will be quite hard. Unless he somehow had the power to provide real life animation to pixels and get a whale that will be willing to do such a task, then yes it is possible.

Well I found a quiz while I was browsing. Its a quiz of which FF girl are you most likely to make love to. Yeah call me somethin. I got Yuna lol.  I got Yuna on my first try. Theres other ff quizzes too on the site. BOYS only lol|The inner retard strikes back}}
{{quote|I SAID I DO NOT SEX GOD DAMN WHALES. UGHHHHHHH. There something called girls. Hot ones.|Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight....}}

== Uncharted 2 ==
As if wanting to bone a fictional character (as well as some poor whales) wasn't enough, [[shit no one cares about|now he seems to want to bone just about every character in the game Uncharted 2. Constantly whoring out his lack of sniper skills as opposed to the lack of success on fucking Yuna in the ass. When he isn't whoring out how much he sucks at the game]], he loves going on rambling sessions about how "[[lies|unique]]" and "[[bullshit|original]]" the game is.

Not to stop there, he goes on and on about just how great his gamer clan is, despite the fact that the majority of the people in there are also no better than [[retards|tits on a fucking warthog]].

== His Brother ==
Apparently, the admins over at good ol' FFF thought it would be a great fucking idea to let MLFY's "[[lover|bro]]" join the forums. [[sarcasm|Way to go, guys]]. First joining using the name M.Bison, forever ruining that image for most of us. Then later becoming Black Butler. Fucking clever way of using an anime to hide your abject fucking racism. 

Many believe that "MLFY Bro #2" is actually just MLFY being a fucking [[insane|loony]], which wouldn't surprise anyone in the slightest. He probably just wanted to [[attention whore|circle jerk his rep around more.]]
