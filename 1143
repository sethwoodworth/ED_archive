Let me make this clear: I hate the Cardinals.|Brandon Phillips, [http://bleacherreport.com/articles/433726-brandon-phillips-10-reasons-the-cardinals-are-the-whiniest-team-in-mlb August 9, 2010]}}

'''Brandon Phillips''' is the Second Baseman of the [[Ohio|Cincinnati]] Reds.

== Basebrawl ==
On August 9, 2010, Phillips flapped his black person to the news media expressing his disgust with the [[St. Louis]] Cardinals.  Not only did he insult the team, but he insulted the fans by expressing [[gay|his love]] for the Chicago Cubs, a team that has not won a World Series since 1908.  Phillips was going to stand by his words despite that several players on his team used to play for the Cardinals.

Needless to say, the Cardinal players, and the ex-Cardinals-now-Reds players, were not at all pleased the following day. And at the first inning of the game on August 10, 2010, when Philips walked up to the plate to bat, Cardinal catcher Yadier Molina had a few choice words for the [[troll]] after Phillips gave Molina a friendly tap against his shin guard.

Both managers of both teams (Tony La Russa and Dusty Baker) were [[Banned|ejected]] from [[the game]]. Molina and Phillips stayed in the game.

Major League Baseball suspended the Red's Johnny Cueto for seven games for his participation in the melee.  However, because he is a pitcher, it means '''he will only miss one game''' despite wearing cleats which may have injured Cardinals catcher Jason LaRue. Cueto was fined as well.

Tony La Russa and Dusty Baker were suspended for two games.

Brandon Phillips and Russ Springer of the Reds and Chris Carpenter and Yadier Molina of the Cardinals were fined.

Cardinal Pitcher Chris Carpenter, who was pinned against the backstop screen like Cueto, but was too afraid to defend himself.  He managed to part from the brawl unscathed despite concerns that he might have been injured.

The organist played the theme from "Rocky" when a fan threw a ceremonial pregame pitch. And Mr. Red acted like boxers, pretending to throw punches on the side.

Cardinal pitcher [[Fundie|Jeff Supan]] was put on the 15-day [[disabled]] list for groin pain, even though he [[Almost Raped|wasn't in the fight]].  He complained of pain while [[masturbating|working out]].

Despite all of this commotion, the Cards still beat the Reds 8-4 then 6-1 on August 11.

Cardinal Fans flocked to Busch Stadium hoping to see an encore of the fight when the Reds play the Cardinals again during the Labor Day Weekend.
