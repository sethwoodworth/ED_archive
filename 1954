'''Dance Dance Revolution''', widely known as simply ''DDR'' (and to [[Europe]]ans as ''Dancing Stage''), is a [[video game]] that involves feigning [[seizure|epilepsy]] to [[shit]]ty [[Japan]]ese, [[Korea]]n, [[Europe]]an, and [[America]]n [[music]]. Unlike many music games ever created, this game manages to combine simulation with a [[buttsecks|high-impact]] aerobic workout, where you use your feet to hit flashing arrows in time with music on a dance pad of some form. [[lies|Health benefits]] are often attributed to DDR by [[fanboys]], while ignoring the property damage and serious [[injury]] to bystanders that result when the [[funny|fat kids fall over]], or when [[lol|bystanders get injured]].

Due to its stereotypical popculture influence, many people associate the game with the [[gay]] and [[asian]] communities. Ironically, few gay people play the game since [[Bullshit|they have better taste in music and actually know how to dance]]. Asians, on the other hand, can always be found playing this game. [[Furry|Furries]] ([[some argue|supposedly of the gay and/or asian sort]]) are the obvious exception here, since they tend to play DDR all the time.

If you do see [[white people|someone with no rhythm]] playing DDR, [[please advise]] them to stop playing immediately. Most arcades will allow you to unplug the machine should your request go unacknowledged, provided that you don't get caught. Also, remember to run like hell afterwards; [[hardcore]] DDR players have a tendency to give chase once you've interrupted their [[faggotry|game]].

Also, 10 year old [[azn]] girls will ''always'' win.

==Features==
[[Image:Fatkid_DDR.gif|thumb|HOLY SHIT HI SCOREZZ!!]]
''Dance Dance Revolution'' is easily recognizable at malls and arcades worldwide with its four distinguishable features.
*'''System''': A machine with arbitrarily flashing lights and loud, crappy techno music.
*'''Players''': Up to two of any [[fat|overweight]]/[[wapanese]]/[[furry]]/black person/[[Whore]] players pounding away on some metal pad with handlebars.
*'''Fans''': Players either awaiting their turn to provide [[fail|entertainment]], or bystanders with [[meh|nothing else better to do]]. Some bystanders even dance the steps behind someone else playing while waiting for their turn to play.
*'''Drunks''': 20-to-30-something [[alcohol]]ics that get their [[I CAME|jollies]] on badly-performed insults towards players.

As is the [[typical]] Japanese style, DDR has sequels upon sequels of games spanning a wide range of gaming consoles, each game differing only by its [[iPod|playlist]] and visuals. It is rumored that DDR has more sequels than even [[Street Fighter]].

===DDR X===
[[Image:Ddrx logo.png|frameless|right|200px|10 YEARS OF DANCING WONDER]]
Konami's signature release to celebrate 10 years of the [[borat|græt success]] of the dancing franchise. sweaty nerds stinking up your local arcade. Plagued by a non-memorable songlist (it's even shitty by DDR standards), malfunctioning and virtually inoperable arcade cabinets, an unnecessary "[[black|urban]]" theme, and an annoying announcer that feels the need to cut in every few seconds to either circlejerk or insult you, DDR X stands out amongst its fellow games as being the worst incarnation of its kind.

====Arcade Cabinets====
The DDR X arcade cabinets are widely known for being the worst of their kind. From the HD lag to the unresponsive pads to the crude asthetic design, many gamers vere severely [[disappoint]]ed at the lack of effort put into development of the cabinets. The playlists on the cabinets are also quite dismal compared to previous releases, but nobody is bitching about the songs anyway because they can't even be played on the faulty mats.

<center>{{morphquote|ddrxdedicabquote|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;
|Nobody in their right mind is going to shell out thousands of dollars for new pads that function mediocre at best and inoperable at worst. I say if you fuck up making something that costs thousands of dollars to buy, you don't deserve a second chance, especially if you mess that up as well. They had THREE years to correct every mistake they made with their original pads, and all they have shown is that they have learned NOTHING from their mistakes.|Thinly-veiled butthurt.
|The thing I REALLY like from the pad is the fact that is it one smooth surface. No screws or corner brackets to get your feet caught on. Sure it is a pain in the ass to maintain, and that is indeed a serious flaw, just hated the fact that my feet got caught continually on the SN dedicabs when I never had that problem with pre-SN machines.|You must be [[doing it wrong]] for your feet to get caught on the brackets.
|all i saw was a giant ds for a bit|lol
|I have to come out and say it. There is one thing I like about this new machine: the new panels. The old one's seem kinda boring now.|See? Not everybody hates them!
|Whether it be consumer software or arcade amusement, all Konami games worth playing are Japanese versions. Fuck American versions, they will always be total shit. Even the Chinese version of Universe 3 is better than the US version. If you want colored manuals, superior gameplay, and better button prompts, stick to Japanese versions. I made sure my MGS4 has a colored manual, which is why I own the Japanese version. Die Konami of America, please die.|Fanboy proving [[Japan]] is truly [[Superior]].

====Dynamite Rave====
Due to unknown licensing issues, the critically acclaimed song ''"Dynamite Rave"'' had it's lyrics modified in the arcade release, to the [[shock|horror]] of many DDR veterans. Even worse is that they [[lazy|didn't bother to re-create the stepchart]] based on the new lyrics — this was eventually fixed in the release of X2/Hottest Party 3, but nobody really cares about that.

|<youtube>QCg373XXA7s</youtube>
}}|color=#BB5555}}</center>

<br/>'''Other Known Regurgitated Songs''':
*'''''Brilliant2U''''': Originally remade for Furu-Furu Party and re-released in HP3. Unlike the results above, people actually like this new version due to it [[irony|actually having lyrics]].
*'''''Keep On Movin'''''': Also remade for Furu-Furu Party and re-released in both HP3 and X2, only nobody really cares about this one in particular.

====The New Announcer====
Every DDR gamer knows the announcer very well. He'd yell out random encouraging phrases at random intervals and keep track of your combos, and was an all around [[pretty cool guy]] that just about every gamer loved and adored. At the release of DDR X, however, many fans were in utter shock to hear (literally) that their favourite announcer had been replaced with an obnoxious, arrogant loud-mouth [[wigger]] that spewed completely [[random]] shit irrelevant towards actual gameplay. Whether you played well or horribly, his incessant periodic chanting would throw you off your dance routine so you'd end up [[you fail it|failing anyway]]. [[Some argue]] that turning off the announcer in sound options allows for smoother and less rage-filled gameplay sessions.

Interestingly enough, this announcer is oddly silent if one happens to be playing a <font color="#FF0000">[[final boss|boss song]]</font>, unlike the announcers from previous games. This could perhaps be a form of thinly-veiled [[troll's remorse]] on the part of Konami, but no one can be sure.

==Types of Players==
There are two main categories of DDR players: casual players and showoffs. Casual players will generally have nothing to speak for other than playing "[[Gay|for fun]]", whereas showoffs are able to play with their eyes closed (or otherwise blindfolded or using the infamous ''Stealth'' mod), [[what|backwards]], attain perfect [[COMBO BREAKER|combo ratings]], or even [[fail|breakdance or otherwise freestyle on the pads]].

==Inane Stepcharts & Edit Faggotry==
<video type="youtube" id="fPY1P4Jbuzw" width="320" height="240" frame="true" desc="DDR and unplayable stepcharts go hand-in-hand." position="right"/>
{{quote|1=Seriously, though; would you really want to see a 19/20 when we have this, the epicenter of boss nonsense, as an 18? I mean Dead End/Oni was there for giggles, but this is a "legitimate" boss.

Knowing our luck, a 20 is going to mean a chart resembling eRAseRmOToRpHAntOM [A] in verbatim for a song that really doesn't need it.|2=[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx0GxBtqIqE Some DDR gamer on stepchart faggotry].}}

[[Image:DDR max 300 super max me mix heavy stepchart.PNG|thumb|Stepcharts are [[serious fucking business]].]]
One of many key aspects of DDR is the stepchart. Self-explanatory, these are [[obvious|charts]] of 'notes' that one steps to during gameplay. DDR is widely known to have batshit insane stepcharts, especially for many of their [[final boss|most challenging songs]]. Some players even go as far as creating edits of stepcharts, making even relatively easy songs impossible to realistically play. On rare occasions they may [[unrealistic expectations|supercede Konami's original creations]], but most of these edits are just outright retarded.

''In The Groove'' was a clone game developed by [[leet|Roxor]] Games, employing the exact same physics of DDR. [[shit nobody cares about|Although similar, it was far superior to its Konami counterpart because it posessed a songlist that didn't consist entirely of Japanese techno crap, the dance pads had better sensors and actually worked like they were supposed to, and you were able to create custom songs with stepcharts]]; note that custom songs could only be [[fail|up to two minutes in length]] however.  Eventually, Konami [[lawsuit|sued the shit out of]] Roxor for [[original content|stealing their original idea]], and they [[fail|went out of business]].
