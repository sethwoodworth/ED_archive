'''[http://www.bannination.com/ banniNation.com] (2007 onward)''' is a "[[lulz|weird news]]" and [[porn]] link aggregator. It is also known as "bN"

banniNation was born [[quiverfull|last Tuesday]] when [[Fark]] [[jumped the shark]] on April the 25th of 2007, with the [[fail|worst site redesign]] [[evar]], and the revelation that paying [[fucktard|totalfarkers]] were being [[baleet|shadow banned]], keeping them paying money while not actually having any ability to post to the site, which made a lot of people [[butthurt|unhappy]].

banniNation exists in a special section of spacetime where everyone is an [[faggot|admin]] and no one is an [[rickroll|admin]] - all users moderate the site and content. this of course leads to drama, especially in [[politics]] threads. [[Some argue]] that bN is full of [[circle jerk|group think]], but this usually gets said after someone gets [[butthurt]] after losing a [[flame war]].

=Content and Meta=

As an aggregator site, bN doesn't have any actual content, as it's easier to just link to places that do the work and then bitch about how [[NPOV|biased]] the source is. as a [[nazi|pr0n]] aggregator, bN is iffy - depending on the evening you'll either get badly airbrushed met-art girls or copious amounts of black person. the real pr0n on bN comes from the exhibitionistic tendencies of its users, who like to post their [[shemale|autoerotic asphyxiation]] photos in multiple threadz.

Voting takes place in da [http://www.bannination.com/queue kew] where users vote what goes front page.  many bloggers have found the bN kew to be an effective place to generate [[google|google ads]] revenue by sending ppl to blogposts that simply reference other blogposts which reference other blogposts which, 30 pages later, link to a huffington post article.  some decry this as [[spam|blogspam]] but [[cracker|grahams]] is cool with it because [[fark|advertisers don't like that shit]].  

A thread becomes [[vagina|meta]] when it becomes so fucking [[epic]] that there exist more posts in threads talking about the thread then in the thread itself.  when this happens, it is the sovereign duty of every bN user to tag the thread "[[azn|meta]]", as six meta tags will banish the article/discussion to the [http://www.bannination.com/?&withmeta mhetto].  bN's most popular tags include meta, [[debate|discuss]], [[your mom]], anything involving black person, and [[f40ph|fuck you eastheimer]]. while some tags may bring much lulz, others are greatly lacking.  Tagging too many things one specific tag results in whining and general butthurt from the bNers who fear change and lulz.

==The Creators==

[http://www.bannination.com/users/grahams Grahams] keeps the [[fail|failboat]] afloat.  bN still wont get 750 users, they're all just alts of the same five people.

[http://www.banniNation.com/users/cranky%20bastard Cranky Bastard] likes ur [[mudkipz]].

[http://www.bannination.com/usersinjuryproneerik IPE] is just as important as the other two, just no one is sure what he does.

==STF* *nd*x and N*ncy M*tr*c==

Using complex [[Al Gore]] rhythms, some [[ninjas]], [[Computer Science III]], and a crosseyed gerbil named Ruprecht, banniNation allows community moderation with lots of numbers. Contrary to other knobs that turn to 11, when your bN knob is turned to -3 you get a [http://www.bannination.com/s/stfu#STFU STFU Index].  Other ways to get STFU'd [[noob]] is to have [http://www.bannination.com/queue kew submissions] voted as [[spam]].  One of the punishments for a high STFU Index is disemvowelment.  Most notably demonstrated first by [http://www.bannination.com/users/tass tass].  After being voted down repeatedly, his first post was "[http://www.bannination.com/comments/5000653&all#49795 dchnzzls]." 

If a user votes down a post, the libs in chat will vote it back up giving that user a pillow-biting-nancy score.  The nancy faces a variety of punishments including not being able to vote, if you attempt to vote you get [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=nancy+boy&btnG=Google+Search taken nancy hunting], and left to nurse your [[butthurt|ass wounds]].  [http://www.bannination.com/users/jingks Jingks] was the ultimate nancy with 54.  That was until [http://www.bannination.com/users/mathmatix mathmatix] more than [http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa316/w1ldcardse7en/mathnancy.jpg doubled his score].

=Great Moments in bN History=

[[Image:Ideal_Woman_according_to_Kesshi.jpg|thumb|left|the ideal woman according to kesshi]]bN users used to get [[lulz]] from a variety of websites, most notably [[fark]].  But when fark closed its doors to lulz and began [[baleet|baleeting]] posts and users, some vowed to [[nevar forget]].

==Christmas Miracle of 2007==

[[Image:EJ0offhismeds.jpg|thumb|EJ0 stopped taking meds when he joined bN.]]
[[Image:Superdug.jpg|thumb|In a world... where Superdug discusses Superdug]]
[[Image:Normal_thread_on_bn.jpg|thumb|a typical bN thread]]Normally, Christmas is the slowest day of the year for a news discussion site, not for bN.  [http://www.bannination.com/users/swingingjohnson Swinging Johnson] submitted and delivered a [[lolcow]] for the bN community, and we didn't get him anything.  It all began in a [http://www.bannination.com/comments/5019896&all meta thread].  SJ, thinking his lulz bring all the boys to the yard, posted [http://www.bannination.com/comments/5019896&all#574886 "If I had known my vote would have caused you to have a Rectal Prolapse I would have not voted it down and spared you the emotional anguish that you now suffer."]  [http://www.bannination.com/mathmatix Mathmatix] then replied with a [[troll|trolling post]], [http://www.bannination.com/comments/5019896&all#574942 "If i would have known you'd get a rectal prolapse from talking about things you've talked about before, i'd probably have said them sooner."]  Thread died, no lulz were achieved.  

Fast forward to Christmas morning, SJ high on [[drug|life]] begins his immaculate butthurt tirade against [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Even_even_moar_bNettez.jpg Mathmatix], who was fast asleep with visions of lulz dancing in his head.  SJ, realizing [[serious business|internet is serious fucking business]], began to make threats about chopping the fingers off of users with a cigar cutter.  You can view whats left of the lulz carcass [http://www.bannination.com/comments/5020047&all here].  SJ's STFU Index is over 6, so he'll enjoy a week of unexpected loneliness and feelings of "[[butthurt|I shouldn't have done that]]."

==Saving bN So You Don't Have To==

[http://www.banniNation.com/users/ratfucker Ratfucker] took his name from a political term, but don't let that fool ya.  He's the rat of bN that considers himself the site's personal [[jesus]].  He posts for the sins of other trolls, so you don't have too.  He crucifies himself as the person to protect bN from the likes of EJ0.  Now that EJ0's [http://www.bannination.com/s/stfu#STFU STFU Index] is stuck at 3 and unable to post, Ratfucker finds his time more idle.  Between the [[emo]] [[depression]] that is slowly driving him to consider [[an hero]] status and unable to deal with the free time, he pops in on occasion desperately trying to appear relevant to an uncaring bN community.(writing credits to [http://www.bannination.com/users/the_gospel_of_thomas The Gospel of Thomas] as most of this was taken from a quote in the beer garden.)

==Stokke is his beard, Boxed Merlot is his courage==

[http://www.bannination.com/users/the_bon_scott Bonnie] is a [[Bisexual|bisexual]] user confused about his life.  Its only when boxes of [[Alcohol#Wine|merlot]] are involved that Bonnie sees things clearly.  When [http://www.mrdaz.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/764_sy070601026.jpg Allison] [http://www.dailypilot.com/content/articles/2007/05/27/sports/dpt-stokke25.jpg Stokke] is involved, expect epic amounts of [[fag|faggotry]] soon after.  After a couple boxes of merlot, Bonnie's meltdowns bring all the boys to the yard.  Examples of his faggotry can be found [http://www.bannination.com/comments/5037971 here](most recent bonnie thread).   

Voted Most Likely to have to explain the transexual hooker in the car (July 7th, 2008);  Voted Most Likely to suck dick for merlot (July 7th, 2008)


==Tits or GTFO==

bN's numerous "bNettes" are quite fond of posting their cash and prizes. All-time all stars include [http://www.banniNation.com/users/heresyoftruth Heresy of Truth] (whose [http://www.bannination.com/comments/5008202&all bacon tits] became an international sensation), [http://www.bannination.com/users/sweetrage Sweetrage], [http://www.bannination.com/users/magic%20nipples Magic Nipples], [http://bannination.com/users/elton%20jon%20benet Elton Jon Benet], [http://www.bannination.com/users/abbynormal Abbynormal], [http://www.banniNation.com/users/illuminaughty Illuminaughty], and [http://bannination.com/users/spongegirl%20circleskirt Spongegirl Circleskirt]. Within bN culture, the blowjob mug is considered the ultimate form of fan service, and is becoming more popular by the week.
