MSDN
The only positive and free software [[Microsoft]] will ever allow to the public. MSDN is an acronym for '''M'''icro'''S'''oft '''D'''evelopers '''N'''etwork. No one ever knew Microsoft was actually two words, [[some argue]] that Microsoft just wanted a catchier website name. This is completely [[gay]] because, yet again, [[Bill Gates]] has twisted the laws of physics, [[time]], and spelling; introducing his own rules for acronyms. Since [[Microsoft]] sucks ballz this is one of their better areas, unlike [[Halo]] which is a completely [[retarded]] [[FPS]].

[[Image:H4x0r.jpeg|thumb|A programmer who uses MSDN looks a lot like this, mainly due to  frustration. The frustration is caused because they don't know how to code a [[noob]] generator in C++.]]
