The Naked Brothers Band
[[Image:Naked-brothers-band_l.jpg|thumb|right|Nat and Alex enjoying their butt bonding in public]]
'''The Naked Brothers Band''' is Nickelodeon's latest project they shat out in order to make a quick buck on some poor parent whose kids actually find them cool. Basically, it’s four annoying [[13-year-old boys|13-year-old boys]] and one slutty [[16-year-old girl]](gang rape anyone?) who thought they had musical talent, so they formed this band. Which really was only formed to sell out and is a huge pile of fail. All their music has the same beat over and over again and are very simple. Honestly, whoever said these kids can sing and perform well needs a punch in the face. [[Fat Larry's Band|Real musical artists]] feel the same way about the Naked Brothers Band as real cartoonists feel about [[Family Guy]]. They are [[Jonas Brothers]] wannabes, and you know what [[Faggots|THAT means.]]


==How This Abomination Happened==
{{quote|Does alienate mean squeeze boobies?| Alex being oh so clever and cute after most likely practicing for weeks}}
So the story goes like this: One day Nat and Alex took a bath together, touched weiners, and after that, they got out and ran around naked in their house screaming “We are The Naked Brothers Band.” Yes, that is completely true and in no way made up. Seriously, look it up. So their billionaire mom Polly Draper went over to Nickelodeon, sucked the presidents of the company's dicks, took a shot in the face and BAM! The Naked Brothers Band was made a show on TV.  May [[God]] have mercy on our souls.

==Meet The Members==
Here are the members of The Naked Homos Band. (Previous "joke" deleted for its [[fag|faggotry]].)

*'''Nat Wolf''': The leader of the band. He wrote and sings most of the songs. He wrote them all when he was like 8-13 which apparently makes him a song writing genius. At some point someone is going to have to point out the elephant in the room and say, “These lyrics suck ass.” Oh, and get this: he says his biggest inspiration are The Beatles. Talk about a real kick in the balls for fans everywhere.

*'''Alex Wolf''': Perverted little prick who thinks he’s “the bad boy and a rebel.” If you actually call yourself this then there is a 150% chance you definitely are not one. He likes to spend his time staring at his babysitter’s chest implants ([[incest|his real life cousin is the actress who plays the babysitter]], lulz) and skateboarding, which is another thing he fails at. Oh, and did I mention he’s the drummer? No? Oh well, it doesn’t matter, he sucks at it.

[[Image:Rosalina.jpg|thumb|right|Rosalina actually quit the band sometime in season 3. Here she is at her new stripper job “Tits For Tots” just off of I-90]]
*'''Rosalina''': The band’s only girl and the bassist. She’s the group's whore who is always ready to get a dick stuck up her pooper except for Nat. She did eventually get together with Nat only to leave on a six month cruise and fuck some French dude which made Nat shit himself, though I’m not surprised. Who would want to do Nat?

*'''Qaasim Middleton''' aka '''The Token''': He’s the black person. He enjoys [[KFC|fried chicken]], waffles, watermelons, and grape soda.

*'''Thomas Batuello''': The obese cellist. Oh yeah, of course they have a cello in their rock band. You know, like [[Shit|KISS]] and [[Gay|Queen]] and all the other rock bands.

*'''Cooper Piolet''': He’s their band manager and handles their money and stuff, which makes sense because he’s a Jew.

There are a shit load of other people too, but [[Noone|who gives a fuck about them?]]

=="Song" Analysis==

So you must think to yourself right now, "Come on, they can’t be that bad..." Well let’s look at some of their [[Shit|songs]], shall we? The first one hear is from their song “Sometimes I’ll Be There”

{{quote|Sometimes I'll be there, sometimes I won't 
And I don't 
Care it's my house 
It's my day 
It's my place so go away 
But you can stay|The Naked Brothers Band}}

So basically they are saying it’s my house so go away. But, you know you should totally stay too. Don’t mind me talking here, I’m just some bipolar whack job. Here’s another great example from the song “Banana Smoothie”

{{quote|Stay Straight, right now it is
Have faith, getting out of it
Feels right, Aloha and Mahalo|The Naked Brothers Band}}

What the fuck does that mean? Where are you getting out of? What’s going on right now? What feels right? Do you have a dick up your butt? Please explain. Here’s my favorite one from the song “Why.” Probably as in "Why are you still listening to this crap?"

{{quote|It wasn’t about the truth, it wasn’t about the lie
It’s just the fact that you made me cry
You didn’t even try, I really want to sigh
I’m sorry but I have to say goodbye|The Naked Brothers Band}}

Apparently, someone told Nat every line in a song has to rhyme, which is probably why he forces them to. Also, you really want to sigh? What, it was too much of an effort to sigh, but it’s cool as long as she knows you wanted to? It basically goes on like this for every song, crappy lyrics to crappy music.

{{quote|I'm the god of rock and roll 
Ill be famous till I'm old|The Naked Brothers Band}} 

Too bad their show's been cancelled. And god of rock and roll? You've got to be kidding me. I'll just step aside and leave this for someone else.

==The Naked Brothers Band video game==

[[Image:Nbb_screw_up.JPG|thumb|right|Do you think we should check the spelling? Nah, fuck it.]] 


Yes, that’s right, they made a fucking video game. Think [[Guitar Hero]] with gay sex and really bad songs. The graphics are as appealing as [[Goatse]], they were too lazy to check their spelling when they made the singing part, and the game is so incredibly easy that anyone could pass on the hardest level of any instrument. It's basically a big pile of fail.


==The Fans==
[[Image:low.jpg|thumb|right|Attendance at NBB’s last concert. This is considered a lot of people]]
Fans? What fans? Who's music taste is so bad they like the Naked Brothers Band?
Whatever fans they have, they're typical fans of [[Kidz Bop]]

Really you guys? Really? There are a shit load of people singing their songs on the YooToobe, but they’re mostly 10 and under.

==How To Troll The NBB Fans==
[[Image:Naked-Brothers-Band-n02.jpg|thumb|right|Effects of a soldering iron shoved in the human rectum]]


Honestly, it really isn't that hard and can become instant lulz. Just like evey other band out there, there are at least some fan girls and gay fan boys who would sacrifice themselves for Nat and Alex. Here are easy ways to troll them.
*Tell them Nat and Rosalina will never end up together
*Talk about Rosalina being a guy
*Send them to this page
*Talk about how they'll never amount to anything more then a joke
*Ask them how much they're being paid to say that they are awesome and that they could use the money.
*Say that in the song "Banana Smoothie", Nat was not talking about bananas the fruit.
*Point out the fact that their mom paid Nickelodeon to have her sons be on TV.
*Say the Naked Brothers Band sucks and then add the words shit, fuck, fag, cock, ass and nazi into the sentence many times until it's illegible.
*Bring any of the band members sexuality into question
