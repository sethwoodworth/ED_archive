Randy Solem is known for single-handedly ruining the [[internets]], [[video games]], and the free will of mankind with his amount of talent (which can be summed up to the size of his penis). Randy is 34 years old and spends his entire day staying inside so people twenty years younger than him can tell him how much they loved "TEH P4RTt WEN Y0SI WUZ MAKIN DA FARTZzz LOoL!!1."

== Randy's Life ==
Randy Solem lives in [[New Jersey]] with his wheelchair-bound vegetable mother. He sits in his room and creates [[Mario]] [[flash]] parodies while listening to Billy Joel CDs. Sometimes he forgets to change his mother's diapers, or even feed her. That's how dedicated Randy is to bringing us the best Mario fart [[LOL|jokes]] evar.<br>

== Randy's Work ==
Randy is the master of taking Mario sprites, [[lazy|tweening]] them, and adding fart jokes. These amazing skills have earned him the most diehard, pathetic fanbase in the history of the [[Internets]]. Randy also has the amazing ability of getting front page on [[Newgrounds]] for a week, no matter how bad his movie is. This is because every member of his [[forum]] is monitored, and if they vote less than 5 they are banned permanently.  DON'T CALL HIM OUT ON HIS WORK THOUGH.  He'll act like an [[Internet Tough Guy]] defending his work to attempt to make you [[sad]].

== Fanbase ==
Randy leads a proud army of [[13 year old boys]] who adore him and will gladly lick the mud off of his boots, which he will then sell to them for 50 bucks. Saying anything negative about Randy on his forums will result in being [[banned]] 53 times simultaneously by 53 different users. Why do they love Randy so much if he's so ruthless? Simple: He makes shitty [[Family Guy|references]] to [[video games]] that were made before they were born. These little fuckwits have never actually played any of these games, but they know everything about them since sprite movies are found [http://newgrounds.com/collection/videogameparodies  everywhere on the entire fucking internet.]  Randy also gets his fans to vote 0 on flashes he doesn't like.

== The Website ==
The website consists of a few dozen tweened sprite flashes.  To view his website you must download obvious [[spyware]] "Zango" and "Hotbar" top gain access.  It infests people's PC's with [[spyware]], but it's OK with Randy because he gets [[Money|cash monies]] for it.  Here are Randy's bullshit excuses for it. 

''"As the owner of videogamedc.com, I'd just like to say that in no way do I "force" anyone to download anything nor does my site install anything without a user knowing. All games or ads prompt/ask the user before they download anything. The user has to physically accept a download for it to be put onto their computer."'' - If you don't download anything the website sends you back to the previous page.  So yeah, you are forced to download this shit if you want to view his site.  THAT SHIT ALSO INSTALLS 10 EXES ON YOUR COMPUTER WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION!

''I'd also like to mention that using Mozilla Firefox eliminates these "problems".'' - No it doesn't.  I have Mozilla [[Firefox]], and I still have these problems, you god damn mother fucking [[lying]] greedy douchebag.

''I am also getting ready to launch a special Wii version of VGDC that is virtually ad free, except for one small banner. For a special preview of "VGDC on the WII" go to www.videogamedc.com/Wii/wii.html.  This simplified version of VGDC is being created specifically for the Wii's opera browser. It is a work in prgress and this may or may not be what the final layout may look like. I don't recommend viewing it on a PC, since it is being optimized for a standard television's resolution. "VGDC on the WII" will let viewers watch VGDC's most popular movies with ease on their television set, from the comfort of their couch.'' Are you really advertising your website features on siteadvisor.com?  Do you have no [[shame]] at ALL?  Oh yay we get to see [[Mario]] farting in standard television resolution, BIG FUCKING WHOOP.

You also have the opportunity to pay Randy money to [[advertise]] your website on his!  Too bad nobody is going to see it without being forced to download [[bullshit]].  Randy will also offer to put your shitty flash movies on his website, because after all it'll get him money off of your work.

== The Forums ==
The VGDC Forums is where all [[13 year old boys]] on the [[Internets]] come from. They always talk in 1337 speak and begin and end every sentence with LOL.  When he first released his VGDC store he [[spammed]] his own forums with endless amounts of topics demanding people to buy every last item for sale.

After a fan of his sent him an email by mistake, this was his response.
