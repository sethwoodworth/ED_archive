My Little Pony
'''My Little Pony''' (also known as massive chunks of fucking plastic taking up space) is a kitschy toy horse series that, because its butt-ugly, only [[loli]], [[furfag]]s and [[otherkin]] can stand. Oh, and some [[My Little Pony Arena|average MLP-loving adults]]. [[Image:Krieg.jpg|thumb|right|Mein Kleine Pferd]]

My little ponies are usually depicted in their supernatural [[fag|superkitschy]]  environment with [[gay|rainbows]] and all that [[faggotry|colorful]], [[insane|manic]] [[shit]]. And you've always wondered why so many teenagers start taking drugs after they were playing with such fucking weird toys? [[Image:Mlp2.jpg|thumb|right|Want retarded kids? Give them retarded toys.]]

Naturally, MLP comes complete with its own set of fail forums, populated by such personages as "Princessbiscuit" and "Sprinky", lol, which should prove easy meat for even the failest of fail /b/tard raiders. <br>[http://robotmantheblog.com/2006/10/25/so-i-guess-i-got-kicked-off-another-my-little-pony-forum/#comment-1281 This guy] seems to have made it his life's mission to be kickb&d from such forums, trailing the lulz in his wake (I'm giving him kudos for the Ministry reference, if nothing else).<br>Sure looks like lulz to me.
