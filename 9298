You don't have any friends
A hilarious insult that can be used by [[elitist]] [[internet celebrities]], [[Delicious Cake|GLaDOS]], [[rich and beautiful]] supermodels or the most common of dirty, filthy [[trolls]].

By using this epithet, your [[e-nemy]] will be instantly [[pwned]]. You may crown yourself king or queen of pwn at your leisure, or have one of your doubtless multitude of friends do it for you.

An example of iron-clad super awesome pwnership forever: 

 <b>[[Paigegirl]]:</b> [[Sup]] elgorgo come join our circle of friends!
 <b>[[Elgorgo]]:</b> Awesome! [[OMG]] You have no idea how long I have
          been waiting for acceptance from you guys!
 <b>Auntiesiannan:</b> [[LOL]] Psyche!   
 <b>[[Elgorgo]]:</b> Wha- what's happening friends?   
 <b>[[Admiral Ackbar]]:</b> [[It's a trap!]]   
 <b>[[Voysu]]:</b> Haha! You're a [[homosexual|faggot]]! Get the fuck out.   
 <b>[[Elgorgo]]:</b> No wait! I thought you guiz were my [[e-pals]] 4ever [[IRL]]!   
 <b>[[Paigegirl]]:</b> Friends? You don't have any friends!   
 <b>[[Elgorgo]]:</b> Internet why have you forsaken me!   
 <b>[[Kamuela]]:</b> I hereby banish you from all friendship on the [[internets]].   
 <i><b>[[Elgorgo]]</b> cries [[emo]] tears of forever sorrow, dies.</i>   
 <b>[[Kamuela]]:</b> [http://www.livejournal.com/interests.bml?int=hurting+elgorgo%27s+feelings Hurting elgorgo's feelings] is of great interest to me.   
 <b>[[Ghostlight]]:</b> [Rushing back in] Did I miss it? I was changing hats.

Any [[victim]] of such a powerful [[Fuck you|pwn-fu]] will suffer the grandest of humiliations. They must [[quit LiveJournal forever]] and begin [[cutting]] in exile. As a result, [[A winner is you|teh winnar]] draws power from the victim's sweet juice of [[You fail it|failure]].

<b>BEWARE!</b> There is an inherent danger in using this classic comeback, as it only works if you have enough friends or [[sock journals]] online at the moment to back you up!'' Do not attempt this [[Rape|unprepared!]] Even the most popular of cheerleaders can be reduced to [[basement-dweller]] status by a well-connected [[nerd]] if she does not keep a group of sycophants ready for instant deployment at all times.

'''Popularity is more important than being right.''' ''[[truth|This is a fact]]''. 

Alterations on this ineffable attack include:
* [[Noone]] likes you.
* You're a faggot. [[GTFO|Get the fuck out.]]
* No one will ever accept you! Not like my clique accepts me!

{{quote|All your other friends couldn't [[come]] either, because you don't have any other friends because of how unlikable you are. It says so right here in your personnel file: "Unlikable. Liked by no one. A [[homosexual|bitter]] [[You|unlikable loner whose passing shall not be mourned, SHALL NOT BE MOURNED".]] That's exactly what it says, very [[FBI|formal, very official.]] It also says [[Truth|you were adopted]], so that's [[lulz|funny]] too.}}
