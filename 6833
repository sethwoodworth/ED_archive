'''Rapidshare''' (or Rapidshit, as it's so affectionately called) is a site run by [[Nazi|Nazi Enthusiasts]], and is a [[tool]] commonly used by [[b/tards|/b/tards]] to pass along giant amounts of [[CP]]. It also holds the title for the website with the most [[irony|ironic]] name EVAR. After Moot introduced a 100 image limit in threads, the use of Rapidshit increased, due to [[Moot]] forgetting what 'imageboard' even means. The [[logic]] behind this is questionable, since Rapidshare also has a 200 MB limit for uploads, due to [[Germany|Germans]] being [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Donate|too poor to afford reliable server space.]] 

[[Shit nobody cares about|Megaupload]] however has a slower time limit between uploads (and also allows uploads of up to 1GB per file), and you should thus use it at the same time to increase the amount that you can download.

Rapidshare is currently [[Sandwich Chef|made of fail and AIDS]], as it keeps on being totally [[ghey]]. Waiting times before downloading a file seem to increase every 10 minutes as well, so boycott it and use Mediafire, Megaupload, Megaporn, Filefactory, Sendspace, Badongo, and whatever other things you can find to [[win|maximise the amount]] of [[pr0n]] that you can download. Unlike Rapidshit, the sites mentioned above do not [[elitist|treat their non-premium users like worthless trash pieces of shit and fuck them over at any given opportunity]], which is unfortunate, because those people are [[asking for it]].

==[[Animal abuse]]==

Recently, rapidshare decided to place tortured animals around their [[captcha]] letters, the users
are presented with a number of letters and are required to pick the ones with the least number of tortured animals; this seems to have worked well against automatic download bots as well as normal human beings, who have to spend more time squinting at obscure animal pictures than they do fapping over whatever porn it is they've been linked to from 4chan. On a side note, rapidshare also decided to introduce the 128 seconds waiting minute to their non-premium users.

[[Image:Rapidshare1.jpg|thumb|A typical CAPTCHA from Rapidshare.]]
[[Image:Rapidshare2.jpg|thumb|Another CAPTCHA.]]
There exists a vastly superior but barely-known alternative to Rapidshit called [http://www.Evilshare.com Evilshare]. Evilshare has no wait time, no upload/download limit (sans file size limitations), and many privacy and control options such as timed deletion, clearly surpasses Rapidshit and similar competitors still in use with it's simple design (think google) and options. You can get [[You|your]] [[CP|fap fuel]] and [[lulz]] without haggling with all the [[fail|douchebaggery]]. <s>[[HAHA DISREGARD THAT!]] You need to pay a shitty fee for a membership to be able to do jack shit.</s> Evilshare fixed its villainous ways and made shit free. You can download your [[CP|kiddy pr0nz]] now [[gentlemen]].
