{{Quote|One of the more pretentious political self-descriptions is "Libertarian." People think it puts them above the fray. It sounds fashionable, and to the uninitiated, faintly dangerous. Actually, it's just one more bullshit political philosophy.|[[George Carlin]], ''Napalm and Silly Putty''}}

'''Libertarianism''' is a fad political ideology for [[13 year old boys]], first year college students, and white business owners who use the "private property" argument so they don't have to serve blacks. Libertarians (conservatives/Republicans), more commonly known as [[Retard|Libertards]] or [[lol|Lolbertarians]], believe that  governmental "intrusion" into peoples lives should be limited as much as possible. Except when someone breaks into their house; they need a contract enforced; or want a health inspector to check out the local restaurants. Government is just fine in those cases. Libertarians believe that in their perfect world, they should be able to fuck dogs without being jailed on sodomy laws. They also believe roads and civic infrastructure are naturally occurring phenomena.

Libertarianism has a big [[crossover]] with [http://www.extropy.org/ Extropians], who think that you can realize [[insane|science fiction]] ideas like space elevators and self genetic engineering in the [http://www.extropy.org/faq.htm near future]. Most Libertarians are either [[13 year old boys]], fratboys who watch ''[[South Park]]'', [[faggot|people that want to appear "alternative"]], or [[batshit insane|paranoid]] survivalists living in tiny cabins in [[Montana]] where they stockpile weapons and food for the dreaded day when [[Jews|Big Brother]] comes 'round tryin' to implant [[mind control|fail]] chips in their brains.

Libertarians believe that humanity falls into two categories: 
# Libertarians
# Sheep

Libertarianism should not be confused with [[Conservatism]], which is exactly what conservatives do. In the same way [[Liberalism|Liberals]] now call themselves "Progressives", Conservatives think "Libertarian" sounds more hip.

==The creation of a Libertarian==
Most Libertarians begin life as a spoiled upper-middle class and very white teen who fails to comprehend that not everyone else in the world is a spoiled upper-middle class white teen.

At first, the young libertardian-to-be has only a vague dissatisfaction. He begins to ask himself questions like:
* "What political philosophy can I both bastardize and miss the point of, so that I can justify being an even more selfish prick than I am now?"
* "How can I reconcile that I hate those who I deem aren't productive, with the fact that I don't need a job because daddy gives me a generous allowance?"
* "Why do we even ''need'' government? Surely almost seven billion people can all police themselves, right?"

The answer comes to them in two little words. Ayn Rand. Never since Barbara Streisand have the words of a half-witted Russian jewess spread so far, and contaminated so many. With sixth-grade level vocabulary, and fourth-grade level philosophy, Rand's book have all the emotional depth of a two-year old's temper tantrum. '''"MINE!!!"''' But like Streisand is to fags, Rand is their holy prophet. She speaks the words so perfectly, the words they want to hear.

"You don't lack compassion! You just want people to get by on their own merits!", She says. "You're not a selfish asshole! You just have a sense of rational self-interest!", She affirms. "You have no obligation to the society in which you live! Governments are only there to lift up those not as good as you!", She declares.

And lo, it was good. Because if there is one thing that makes financially comfortable white people feel good about themselves, it is that they ''earned'' the benefits of being financially comfortable, clearly by their own merits. 

It wasn't daddy's money that bought you your head start in life. It wasn't the better schools, the better nutrition, the better neighborhoods. It wasn't the country you were born in, or the system of laws that protected and to this day protects you. It wasn't the various government agencies making sure you have licensed doctors, clean drinking water, or safety standards for vehicles.

No, my young privileged white boy, you did it all. You, and only you, are responsible for all your success. And anyone who isn't as well off just didn't work as hard. And the government can only take from a productive member of society like you to give to the leeches. And there should be no laws. And even though there are laws, they don't ''really'' apply to you, because you're special. Be as selfish as you want. It's all you. 

And thus, a libertardian is born.

==Trolling a Libertarian==

To troll a libertarian online, just post the following:

{| border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0
|This morning I was awoken by my alarm clock powered by electricity generated by the public power monopoly regulated by the US Department of Energy.

I then took a shower in the clean water provided by the municipal water utility. Then, I brushed my teeth with that water, filtered to standards set by the EPA and my state.

After that, I turned on the TV to one of the FCC regulated channels to see what the National Weather Service of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration determined the weather was going to be like using satellites designed, built, and launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I watched this while eating my breakfast of US Department of Agriculture inspected food and taking the drugs which have been determined as safe by the Food and Drug Administration.

At the appropriate time as regulated by the US Congress and kept accurate by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the US Naval Observatory, I get into my National Highway Traffic Safety Administration approved automobile and set out to work on the roads built by the local, state, and federal Departments of Transportation, possibly stopping to purchase additional fuel of a quality level determined by the Environmental Protection Agency, using legal tender issued by the Federal Reserve Bank and printed by the Federal Bureau of Engraving and Printing. On the way out the door I deposit any mail I have to be sent out via the US Postal Service and drop the kids off at the public school.

I park my car on the street, paved and maintained by the Department of Transportation, and put quarters issued by the United States Mint into the parking meter.

Then, after spending another day not being maimed or killed at work thanks to the workplace regulations imposed by the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, I drive back to my house which has not burned down in my absence because of the state and local building codes and the fire marshal's inspection, and which has not been plundered of all its valuables thanks to the local police department.

I then log onto the Internet which was developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Administration and post on freerepublic and fox news forums about how SOCIALISM in medicine is BAD because the government can't do anything right. Keep government out of my Medicare!

== Libertarianism and Autism ==

Libertarianism is expected to be included in the next edition of the [[DSM]] as a form of [[autism]], as part of a further partitioning of [[Asperger's Syndrome]] due to an overwhelming rise in its e-diagnosis.  Libertarians share many qualities with the Ass Pies, but differ in the fact that they see themselves as incarnations of [[Ayn Rand]] and the characters in her novels, rather than as [[Otherkin|dragons or elves]].

==Libertarian Mating Habits==

Libertarians attract [[fag|mates]] by posting [[shit_nobody_cares_about|all kinds of lame shit]] about the [[John_Kerry|Illuminati]] and [[JEWS_DID_WTC|Masonic conspiracies]] in [[conservative]] forums and blogs, as well as in the [[IMDb]] subforums for any movies that have anything to do with [[politics]], as well as positing why the producers of any Gulf War I and II movies [[Why_do_you_hate_America?|hate America]].

Libertarians also spend a lot of time pissing and moaning about not being able to get dates, a fact which they attribute to women for being [[slut|dimwitted, manipulative, self-loathing harlots]] who dig [[rich and beautiful|assholes]], because intelligent, [[emo|emotionally sensitive]] women would certainly date them otherwise. It couldn't POSSIBLY be that women [[DO NOT WANT|are generally repulsed by]] [[fat]], [[neckbeard]]ed chauvinists who spend all their time on the [[internets]] arguing about [[Linux]] and stroking their own egos ([[lol]], [[irony|personal responsibility]]).  Closely related to "[[nice guys]]", except malcontented and oafish.

==Libertarianism on The Intertubes==

[[some argue|Some say]] that libertarianism is growing in popularity due to [[President Barack Obama]]'s [[fascist]], [[socialist]], [[Nazi]], [[liberal]], [[fag|progressive]] policies.  Luckily for [[you]], this popularity has resulted in a plethora of [[facebook|websites]] and [[old_media|publications]] dedicated to the [[trolling|intellectual discussion of lolbertarianism]]. As expected, most libertarians found on the tubes are old and thus have never heard of trolling, let alone a [[meme]].  

In addition to the typical libertarian [[basement_dweller|hangouts]], there is a [[LiveJournal]] [[community]] dedicated to {{ljcomm|user=libertarianism}}. Reading it is a lot like [[fuck]]ing a beehive. The [[community]] mostly serves as a forum for discussing [[bestiality]] and [[necrophilia]]. 



==How to piss off a Libertarian==
You can [[troll]] in the following ways:

#Ask them about the Civil Rights Act, they will go around your question and say its a "Property rights issue", when in fact they are closet racist.
#Ask them how and why what the government does is bad, you'll just get "[[FAIL|because...TEH GUBBMINT!!]]", with no real logical answer backed up with facts.
#Remind them that public roads is socialism, and using them makes you a socialist. The Libertarian response would be "[[ALL CAPS|THE GOVERNMENT IS A MONOPOLY, I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE!111]]" (this remark will make them go ape shit!)
#Also bring up that public schools are funded by the government; you see, every Losertarian went to a public school but yet they call for abolishing public schools, which is where over [[OVER 9000|9000%]] of them all went!
#Remind them that Ron Paul can never become President because he's a 9/11 [[truther]].
#Most Libertarians are young, uneducated college dropouts that work minimum wage jobs; ask them about minimum wage, and if they are willing to get paid $1.00 /hr - the typical Losertarian response would be "[[PWNED|*cricket*............................*cricket*]]"
#[[Troll]] Ron Paul forums, call for major foreign intervention and military bases everywhere.
#Call them [[conspiracy theorist]]. Libertards hate that!
#Tell them that Thomas Jefferson (Libertarians' favorite person), said good things about the [[Illuminati]] and supported Adam Weishaupt [[NWO|ZIONIST JESUIT VATICAN NWO!!1]].
#Ask them, [[Why do you hate America?| WHY U HATE 'MURKA]]?
#Since they hate the government, ask them how they feel about [[pedo]] laws - Libertarians' obviously being for free choice/free will, they will most likely go around your question and say "[[EPIC FAIL|I DON'T SUPPORT SEX WITH MINORS!!1]], but not answer your question. If they say yes on keeping it illegal, they are [[socialist|COMMIE BASTARDS]], if they say no - [[dinosaur|tehy are 50 year old closet pedos!1]].
# Suggest the PATRIOT ACT is constitutional.
# Agree with any form of taxation.
# If they try a motto like "Taxation without representation!", ask them if they live in Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, or any US outlying territory. If they say no, then point out that there's a reason they're called "State ''representatives''".
# Make up elaborate [[lie]]s about how government interference is directly correlated with general happiness and [[Drug#cocaine|coke]] supply, forcing them to do actual work to prove you wrong.
# Espouse the virtues of eugenics and see how many "freedom-lovers" actually agree with you.
# Create a thread titled "DATING TIPS," pretend to be an [[Lie|athletic, attractive, emotionally-sensitive Libertarian with good job security]], post a sob-story about not being able to get a girlfriend and watch it grow to [[over 9000]] pages about the naïveté of women and how Libertarians are better lovers.
# Remind them the Internet was invented by the government.
# Ask them to explain the Electoral College in their own words. If they start talking about the voting process, point out that republics don't have a voting system.
# Be a minority (specifically a [[woman]])... unless you are using a [[Facebook]] [[sockpuppet]] account, in which case, make her [[tits_or_gtfo|very hot]]. 
# Tell them [[Ron Paul]] is a racist and is supported by the [[KKK]].
# Ask them to name a single Libertarian community that worked in the real-world. If they mention WW2 Catalonia, add on "in the long term" and "those were [[hippies|communes]] and refugee camps, you fucktard".
# Mention government or 'socialistic' successes and private sector endeavors failures.
# Show them [[The Story of Ricky|Riki-Oh]] to demonstrate why privatizing prisons would be a bad idea. 
# Praise the [[shit no one cares about|Labor Theory of Value]].
# Tell them that libertarianism is anarchy for rich people (because it's true, lol)
# Say FDR and Abraham Lincoln were the best US presidents.
# Point out the fact libertarianism is just a type of [[conservatism]]
# Ask them why they hate the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution 16th amendment] when they claim to love the Constitution
# Spout conspiracy theories about how Ayn Rand was a soviet double agent or how Thomas Jefferson was trolling when he wrote the Declaration of Independence. This should actually be pretty easy, as libertarians are known to take to conspiracies faster than [[My Chemical Romance|MCR]] to a cock.
# Tell them that Ben Franklin used state money to fund a hospital.
# Tell them you're voting for Bob Barr.
# Link them to [http://world.std.com/~mhuben/faq.html this].
# Treat Libertarianism and [[Objectivism]] as synonyms (because they are, lol)
# Point out that the Green Party supports pot legalization, too
# Use [[Bioshock]] as an example of why a Libertarian society can never exist (be careful, some of them are stupid enough to think Rapture was a utopia)
# Ask them what they think of monopolies and trustbusting.
# Ask them how old they were when they became a Libertarian. 99% of the time they will have been under 16. Then say they were too young to understand politics.
# Tell them that Somalia seems like a nice libertarian haven.
# Point out that the news and media are businesses and see how many "Defenders of Liberty" want the government to close those down they disagree with.
# Say anything positive about the [[pigs|police]].
# Comment that Dennis Kucinich is the Ron Paul of the left.
# Tell them you are a [[leftard|left-libertarian]].  Be sure to back this up by being liberal on any social issue.
# Point out that the only way to stop oppression without government interference is through [[hippies|community organizing]].
# [http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul98.html Run for president as a Republican, don't stfu about how terrible federal bans are...and then vote for federal bans.]
# Tell married libertarians that if they want the federal government out of their business, they should get a divorce and live in sin.
# Mention how much it upsets you that [[Glenn Beck Raped And Murdered A Young Girl In 1990]].
# Explain to them how large companies always end up using or creating government in order to enforce a monopoly and that a free market can't exist if there's a coerced monopoly.
# Ask them how they, a redneck living in his mother's basement with no experience in law (other than getting arrested for illegal firearms possession), know more about the Constitution than law school graduates and a [[Black Jesus|constitutional scholar]].
# Ask what they think about the [[WBC]] and the state laws preventing them from protesting funerals. This will trick them into not only saying that they support the evil gubment, which should always be wrong, but that they're against freedom of speech which is in the ZOMG CUNTSTITTOOSHUN!!!!11
