After the Dutch and later the [[Jews]] successfully purged New York City of any and all Native Americans, set up shop and started civilization anew in the New World, they realized that while Manhattan was a cool place to party, [[penis|it]] was kinda small and there was nowhere to dump their empties the next day. Immediately to the south and west was a large swamp, and there was much rejoicing, as the northeast had found a home for all their garbage. That bright new place, that beacon of dumps, was New Jersey.  New Jersey is the birthplace of many celebrities who became famous only after getting the fuck out of this shithole.

== History ==

New Jersey's  first colony was the rest-stop at the Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge. Early settlers came here in search of up to 30% cheaper gas and the freedom to get a reasonably priced blowjob by a transsexual Puerto Rican named Tiki in the back of their tractor-trailer. These rest-stops are a staple of New Jersey history and culture frequented by everyone, including the former Governor Jim McGreevy (he was later [[IRL_B&|IRL b&]] from his office for his [[faggotry]]).

From this first settlement sprang up hundreds of square miles of straight, unadorned numbered roads, rancid power plants, and strip malls. This budding culture capital attracted settlers from all over southern New York, and after a few generations, those three families inbred to become the bustling society that New Jersey is today with a population of over 8 million people. In New Jersey, everyone [[wincest|really is family]]!

=== Great Moments in New Jersey History ===

'''1664:''' Two English rowboats under the command of Colonel Richard Nicolls single-handedly took over the entire colony by grimacing 'in a manner most foul and uncouth.' The area was subsequently granted its present name.

'''1776:''' Washington crosses the Delaware to rape some Hessians on Christmas.

'''1967:''' Newark Riots occurred, a bunch of [[niggers]] went nuts and burnt down their own homes. Nothing of value was lost.

'''2004:''' NJ Governor Jim McGreevey, after being caught having surprise buttsecks at rest stops, resigned from office, announcing that he is a "[[gay]] [[americunt]]".

'''2007:''' The [[Chinese]] issue Ǌ its own Hanzi Unicode character.

== Economy ==

The pharmaceutical industry has a strong presence in New Jersey, making the place kind-of okay, because everyone likes new [[drugs]]. The [[typical]] experience of the New Jersey economy is the many gas stations (all [[spics|full-serviced]]), retail strip-malls containing everything from clothing shops to fast food restaurants, factories, and power plants.  It can be derived that New Jersey's economy is based entirely upon giving you [[cancer]] and then selling you [[drugs]] to slow down your eventual [[death]].

Several nationally known universities are located in New Jersey, including Rutgers located in [[niggers|New Brunswick]], and Princeton, an [[unwarranted self importance|ivy league university]] which nobody ever mentions being in Jersey, because IT'S NEW FUCKING JERSEY.

The shoreline holds a number of exciting opportunities, such as [[Atlantis|Atlantic City]], where you will be raped, robbed, and/or totally jewed out of all your dough.  Further up the coast is Asbury Park, the original site and continued example of [[Fail]].

Despite the judgment passed upon New Jersey by New Yorkers, Philidelphians, Connecticunts, Northern Delawarians, Jews, Nigras, Comedians, Late night talk show hosts, Films, Television, the Internet, your Mom, your dog, and your [[Lemonparty|Grandpa]], New Jersey is actually jam-packed with valuable additions to the American cultural landscape.

=== [[So Cash|Guidos]] ===
{{tinyquote|Hey Faggots,

My name is John, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded, no-lifes who spend every second of their day looking at stupid ass pictures. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten any pussy? I mean, I guess it's fun making fun of people because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to pictures on facebook.

Don't be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I'm pretty much perfect. I was captain of the football team, and starter on my basketball team. What sports do you play, other than [[anime|"jack off to naked drawn Japanese people"?]] I also get straight A's, and have a banging hot girlfriend (She just blew me; Shit was SO cash). You are all faggots who should just kill yourselves. Thanks for listening.

=== [[House]] ===
Dr. Gregory House, Anonymous' favorite TV doctor and his wily gang are proud residents of the state of New Jersey, on TV. Being doctors, and being fictional, their lives are pretty sweet. This may be '''the''' redeeming factor of the cultural condition of the state of New Jersey. And remember, whatever is wrong with New Jersey, it definitely is fucking NOT LUPUS.

=== [[Hal Turner]] ===
As far as the internet is concerned, the greatest thing to come out of New Jersey is a radio talk show host and [[internet tough guy]], Hal Turner. Hal thinks that white people are [[teh]] [[THE BEST|best]]. His show comprised of massive amounts of [[BAWWW]], [[lies]], and posturing against the [[liberal|liberals]]. In this classic tale of trying to troll the trolls, Hal learns the hard way that Anon does not forgive, forget, and is most certainly legion.

The chronicles of the collective efforts [[7chan]]/[[4chan]]/[[YTMND]]/[[Ebaumsworld]] and [[Bantown]], including lots of prank calls, cloaks, at least 7 proxies, and information about Hal's beautiful North Bergen, NJ estate can be found [[Hal Turner|here]].

=== Nudity ===

New Jersey is also home to the [[b|Incest Nudist Colony]] of the Rock Lodge Club located in Northern New Jersey in the New Jersey Highlands. Why anyone would want to get naked in New Jersey or let alone be around other nude New Jersians is beyond human comprehension.

== Famous Residents == 

As you can see, because of New Jersey's [[Retard|dense population]], there have been lots of celebrities hailing from this wasteland.  What do they all have in common?  THEY GOT THE FUCK OUT AND NEVER CAME BACK.
