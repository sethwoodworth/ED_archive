"'''I got married last night [pics]'''" is a thread that appeared on the Sherdog Mixed Martial Arts Forums, it's basically a rerun of [[Got my girlfriend to model for my car]], but [[Over 9000|over 9,000]] pounds heavier. On November 11, 2008 a /b/tard called [[Crum375|CrumBum]] decided that he would show off the following John Candy lookalike bride to community of oiled up martial arts knobshiners in an effort in order to troll what he perceived as the largest group of [[Internet tough guy|internet tough guys]] within close reach. 

Though many members of the Sherdog forum themselves are registered members of [[NAMBLA]], most were [[Rage|outraged]] at learning of CrumBumâ€™s nuptials to the man/hippo hybrid. Though, some demanded the wife's [[DO NOT WANT|nudes]]. Since its posting, the thread has received several thousand pages views and continues to serve as a warning to those interested in genetic engineering.

The pics were rumored to have been posted somewhere else a year before it was on the martial arts forums. None of the juicers picked up on Crumbum's location being listed as [[Interior Crocodile Alligator|"Chevrolet Movie Theater"]].

{{quote| How dare you talk about my wife like that, you are lucky I am in the military and am considered a [[Internet Tough Guy|deadly weapon]] or [[Kung Fu|I would fight you in her honor]]. As for children we have one on the way now, which is why I married her. She is upset about [[fat|losing her figure]] but I still think she looks [[fugly|great]].|Baby whale expected soon, man the harpoons.}}

{{quote|Jew [[Wrong|I waited until marriage to lose my virginity]].|Thx to [[Virgin|''Silver Ring Thing'']] for the lulz.}}

{{quote|Well, after the wedding we went to the Motel 6 (we live in a small town, thats all there was)
and it was on. [[goatse|We quickly undressed and got right down to business.]] I had to be careful, as she was a virgin and it was quite painful for her. [[DO NOT WANT|I managed to get in there after a few minutes of trying.]] I only lasted about 2 minutes, but it was amazing. The best part was when [[Lie|we both orgasmed at the same time.]] [[Emo|I cried for a little while afterward,]] it was just so beautiful.|CrumBum commenting on his altered beast of a wife.}}

{{quote|...a girl like this only comes along once a lifetime at best (beast?) and I'm glad I didn't let her get away.}}

== Possibility of Epic Troll? ==

[[Image:Married weekend troll.PNG|thumb|left|Proof of some [[epic]] [[trolling]].]]

[[Image:Married weekend troll 2.PNG|thumb|Moar evidence.]]

One wonders how the newlyweds could have been married because they had a [[dead baby|baby]] on the way and then have painful, two-minute long, weepy virginal sex on their wedding night, and sadly it could be the crack in the foundation of an epic troll's magnum opus. Honestly, the logic doesn't add up. There are three explanations for this conundrum of epic proportions. Explanation one is that it is a troll, in which case, we were had by a master. Explanation two is that it is a [[time paradox]] where she got [[Bristol Palin|pregnant]], went back in time, and forced him to marry her because she date raped him (because honestly who would willingly fuck that hambeast?) once she found out she was pregnant. The final explanation is that she wasn't a virgin and the baby belongs to someone else, which is highly improbable because Jesus fucking Christ, look at her. She's the poster child for marital [[rape]], [[abortion]], [[child abuse]], why you should commit [[an hero|suicide]], why you shouldn't get married, and why ugly people should be removed from the gene pool via legal human hunting seasons.
