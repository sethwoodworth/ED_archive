'''''BOLO''''' is a completely crap 2D game that was the only game to be ever released on the [[Mac]] computer platform. The games graphics and gameplay are on par with what you would find on the [[Atari]].

Despite its cruddy graphics and [[nothing|nonexistent]] gameplay, Mac users keep playing this game trying to relive the glory days of [[oxymoron|mac gaming]]. Like most [[emo|emo kids]] blinded by [[nostalgia]], ''BOLO'' gamers try to convince you that like NES games, this games gameplay is better than most [[mainstream]] games. However the reality is that it sucked then, and it still sucks now.

One big advantage is that asides from its age, it can still be played via the [[internets]] as well as on your schools aging 2mhz maclab that the faculty are still paying off.

For instant [[lulz]], kill your enemies [[man]] and then trap him by building a cement block on him!
