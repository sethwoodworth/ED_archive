Paheal
[[Image:Rule34.paheal.net_logo.png|200px|right]]
'''Paheal''' is the most complete, useful and effective site at [[raping]] your childhood. It is the best [[rule 34]] site in existence ([[never|when it works]]).  While it has seemingly limitless pages of win, it only loads shit about 5% of the time.  And don't even try the goddamn "tag list," it looks promising but as soon as you click something the whole site freezes and the text jumps around like [[your mom]] on a black dick.  Better off with [[Aerisdies|AerisDies]]. Please watch out for dismembered labia, they are often found on tables. If you make 34 of something Paheal WILL find it.

==Why does it exist?==
Paheal was spawned on [[last thursday|April 24, 2007]] and exists for the same reason Macrochan does. The people that have the [[porn|goods]] got sick and tired of giving out the really easy shit, and all their [[epic]] finds were no where to be seen. Now, if some [[silly sausage]] asks for porn of [[Megaman|X]], you can tell them to [[Lurk Moar|LURK THE FUCK MOAR]] and go to Paheal. Now, 34 fans can get their daily chicken choke fix without hearing bitching from [[7chan]], whining: '34 has already been fulfilled', 'gb2/h/', or denial of [[moar]]/[[sauce]]. Needless to say though, don't be a douche you fucking cunt rag and lurn 2 [[internet]].

==Userbase==
<big><b>[[Paheal/Userbase|More info and logs on the userbase can be found here.]]</b></big>

[[Image:SR-X's One True Love.png|thumb|right| 5/4/08 The day [[fatass|SR-X]] lost his one true love]]

The user base generally consists of massive [[spider expert]]s, rejected trolls and lurking spics.
Most of an image's comments consist of random memes being tossed around like a 12-year old Taiwanese prostitute in a back alley, [[faggot]]s begging for [[sauce]], [[Anonymous|unregistered users]] bitching about how their moms raped them up the ass with rake, and 14-year old [[deviantart|TARTS]] either plugging their shitty web page or begging for more [[Sonic]] and [[Naruto]] bullshit. Some users claim that they are women and are instantly and furiously [[raped|hit on]] by just about every other member of the site ''(as per internet regulations)''. This is bullshit because as we all know there are [[no girls on the internet]] except [[dickgirls]] thus proving that at least 80% of Paheal users are [[gay]]. Enjoy your [[AIDS]].

==What is on the site?==
[[Image:Ggn00b.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Rule 34]]'s in ur base raepin ur doodz!]]
*'''34 [[for the lulz|for teh lulz]]''' - Probably the second best reason to visit. [[Meme]]s are very popular, plus lots of ridiculous shit that is awesome.
*'''34 for raping your childhood''' - Just when you thought Salute Your Shorts was too obscure for some fidgety artist to use in his latest necroscat [[Aliza_Shvarts|masterpiece]]. 
*'''34 for fapping''' - There is a good bit of this, but that's not very funny. Also if you go to paheal with the intention to fap you probably don't belong on the internet and will probably end up with  [http://rule34.paheal.net/post/view/131570 this].

*'''not34''' - Tag rushing things as not34 as well as notporn are a common and awesome pastime sure to prove you either don't know what the fuck you're talking about or are so goddamn awesome you didn't even have to read the [http://rule34.paheal.net/rules.html FAQ]. <br />
''(are you a bad enough dude to tag [[over 9000]] images as 'not34' before getting [[Banhammer|B&]]?)''

*'''Not_Porn''' - Images that can range from [[ecchi|almost porn]] to a photo of an ordinary [[house|building]]. Uploading these can bring the user scorn, or lulz. 

*'''Do Not Post''' - Some [[retards|artists]] don't want pictures posted on Paheal because they run a retarded Jew, but some artists don't want their pictures on Paheal because they suck [[cock|at art]] and are told by Paheal's users such. Of course since these artists are huge [[Faggot|faggots]] they tag their shitty little [[penis|picture]] for delete, which mods promptly delete because the picture is a piece of shit.

*'''tagme''' - Images with just the default keyword of tagme either mean the up-loader is black person, or doesn't know what the hell is going on.

==[[Lolicon]] and [[Shotacon]]==
[[Image:Blue Paula.jpg|right|thumb|A typical loli on Paheal... Is that [[Earthbound|Mr.Saturn]] painted on the wall?]]
Surprisingly, you won't find many flame wars about this here. Though, it's easy to troll. All you have to do is say that it is [[illegal]], or wrong, or for epic trolling, that you will go to hell for fapping to it.
{{quote|"you looked at a picture of a naked 12 year old?!" "um, shes not 12. i just drew her like 20 minutes ago lol" "OMG PORN OF 20 MINUTE OLD CHILDREN. PRISON FOR LIFE!"|Malorie}}

===[[Furry]]===
[[Image:Krystal IRL.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kill it with fire|KILL THIS WITH MOTHERFUCKING FIRE!]]]]
Being a site that allows furry, but is mostly filled with people who hate furries; It's not to hard to start a flame war on the subject. Really, it just takes posting something. Since furries ruin everything, large amounts of hate will spring up immediately. But seriously though, there is some furry shit on this site that will make you cry. Also: what is and isn't furry is [[serious business]]. Just so the [[n00b]]s know, if it is covered in fur, it's a furry. If it isn't covered in fur it isn't furry. Same with scaleys. On the [[mexico|boarder line]] are things that are their own race. [[PETA|Minotaurs]], [[jews|kobolds]], [[shit no one cares about|Khajiit]], and [[Final Fantasy|moogles]]. This is also a great thing to [[troll]] about unless you are a [[faggot]].

People on this site who fap to [[Gardevoir]] like to argue that this does not make them furry so please give them a good swift kick in the cunt.

===[[Guro]]===
Most guro on the site is littered with shit storms about how horrid guro is. The guro can get pretty epic though when Soemele, Paheal's own resident [[guro|gurofag]] drops by has occasionally been known to make some pretty [[Epic Win|epic]] [[guro]]. Most of his works are of strong female [[animu]] characters or of [[Jews|minor]][[Mexicans|ities]] that he gets a raging hard on for, but they are still epic. Still, he will always be there to guro up bitches who fuck with Paheal or more realistically, him. His most epic guro to date is the one he did about [[StrangerWithCandy]],who bitched about how her crappy sketch of a [[mudkip]] was placed on the site. In response, Soemele tied her up, force fed her a mudkip, ripped her stomach out, and then pierced both her and her mudkip with a wooden stake through her vagina.

===Shops===
[[Image:Fakes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Shops at their best]]
Many people like to wack it to celebrities but soon find that most of the ones they want to fap to are [[underage]]. To fix this world wide epidemic the scientists of the internet diligently worked day and night in search of a [[Large Hadron Collider|solution]]. Sadly right before they were about to make a major breakthrough they stumbled on Rule 34 and upon reading it instantly came up with a quick fix to all of our problems. Their solution: dig up your favorite porn pic from your hard drive and shop the face of the celeb you want to fap to into the picture.

The only problem with this brilliant scheme is the fact that over 9000% of the shops were painfully obvious and looked like shit. These shops are put on paheal daily and often bitched about by Anonymous. Soon [[w|George Bush]] learned about the American method to evading the [[v&|van]] so he changed the rules so that you could not longer put the head of anyone underaged onto people who are having sex, regardless of the bodies age. So if you want to fap to Stephanie your out of luck. [[Legal|THIS JUST IN: EMMA WATSON IS NOW LEGAL IN THE U.S POST SOME FUCKING SHOPS!]]<br />
''(Also putting images already on Paheal onto a [[template]] is fine too)''

==Paheal's 'Memes'==
Most Paheal memes are just one picture posted over and over with minor alterations each time.
===[[Legend of Zelda|Ganon]][[Forced Meme|Watch]]===

Starting with sum [[pr0n]] of [[arab|Ganon]]Jew watching [[shotacon|Young Link]] and [[pedophile|Young Zelda]] sexing it up through a window, a [[faggot|user]] decided it would be [[lulz|funny]] to shop the peeping tom into '[[Spengbob|Gendodorf]]'. This sparked a chain of MS Paint add-ons to the image, turning Ganon into a [[meme]] monster. After the original picture could be edited no longer user Foppe (A.K.A Faggot) decided to simply replace Ganondorf with [[Gardevoir]] thus starting a shitty [[mini meme|spin-off meme]]. Soon a user named Jew simply removed the Ganon and placed himself, in netsona form, as well as Old Snake instead, both sporting "[[wapanese|o3o]]" faces, thus giving all other members with netsona another reason to [[spam|post]] more pictures that they could tag with their username.

[[Dyke|Grem]][[Scat|rat]] quickly [[lies|claimed]] to have created the meme, when all she did was suggest a version. The meme quickly spiraled out of control and turned fail, as other [[fags|users]] started spamming their own versions, effectively killing its lulz. Titanium quickly rushed in and declared this meme to be [[goodnight sweet prince|dead]], stating that any additional GanonWatch pics would be terminated. Titanium and the other mods occasionally let new GanonWatch pictures slide.

===[[Moderator|Admin]][[War|Wars]]===
When two site admins have great differences in [[shit nobody cares about|opinion]], they may [[Brawl|clash]] in the IRC, or in comments. The most recent adminwar is between [[America|Warrior]] and [[Japan|Titanium]], regarding if [[Super Smash Bros|Zero Suit]] [[Metroid|Samus]], [[Tits or GTFO|with only having Tits or nipples showing under the Zero Suit]] qualifies as porn. Warrior is biased, due to his [[Xbox|massive]] Samus [[fetish]]. Upload sum Samus, that could easily be seen as porn or not porn, and watch the [[lulz]] commence.

=='''<b>Paheal Forced Memes</b>'''==
===[[delete|DEL]]===
originally used by users in comments for deletion, too [[lazy]]/retarded to tag deleteme, but is now mostly done for spam and annoyance, and has lost its purpose and original meaning.
Del is also a [[nigra]] ghost from the [[shitty]] band the [[RAPE APE|Gorillaz]].

===It's Ditto===
It's Ditto is just like the [[Ditto]] meme with an [[gay|additional]] twist - when ever a unidentified [[penis|pink object]] is found in a picture, someone posts "It's Ditto". From that point onward, anyone who opposes the fact that it's ditto is answered by "It's Ditto"
:Anonymous1: It's Ditto
:Anonymous2: That's not Ditto it's a prolapsed anus.
:Anonymous3: It's Ditto

===[[tl;dr|Whole Thread]] [[Copypasta]]===
This is when a user copypastas every word in the comments area for that one image and submits it as their own comment. This is usually done on images whose threads are already [[OVER 9000]] posts in length. This act pisses everyone off, excluding trolls. The mods end up deleting the post, and the [[faggot|poster]] ends up [[B&]]. This makes preforming a whole thread copypasta the equivalent of an [[Iraq|Iraqi]] [[suicide]] [[911|bombing]]

===Self-Inserting Comments===
Self-Inserting comments are made when a Paheal user comments a picture saying what he wants to do to the people or person in it. [[fail|Former]] user [[Futa|Big]][[Lover|Dawg]] was among the [[In b4|first]] to explicitly describe what he'd do to the people in the images, as if they where [[IRL|real]], would read the [[tl;dr|comments]], jump out of his [[Computer|monitor]], and let him [[suck]] their [[dick]]. The majority of users who do this are [[Mexican|immigrants]] from [[Aerisdies]]

===Ifucked[enter well known namefag here] & [enter well known namefag here]isanigger===
Last thursday people began signing up as "Ifucked" and then a well known user's name. It all started with IfuckedCatBountry, Google that shit [[MAH BOI|Mah Boi]]. Then a Doc Icegonogle hate made the user name DocIcenogleisanigger.

===[[Forced Meme|In The Den?]]===
In the den is a meme exclusively to the underage b& members of the Paheal [[IRC]]
everyone else thinks it is [[epic fail|annoying]] as fuck. While originally used to answer a question or post you didn't understand it is not being used just for the sake of posting.

===[[Unwarranted_self_importance |Netsonas]]=== 
[[Image:Netsonas on ED!.jpg|thumb|right|150|[[Unwarranted_self_importance|Netsonas]]]]
Only the most awesome and [[1337]] members have a netsona; which is a fuckton like a [[fursona]] except they somehow manage to be twice as gay most of the time. <br />
The best way to gain a [[Scientology|cult]] like following of pre-teen zombie retards is to draw as much porn of your netsona as possible, like some sort of masturbatory-go-round. Pair yourself up with whoever the fuck you want and no matter how shitty the artwork is you will get [[Over 9000]] comments before you can hit F5. [[George_Zimmer|I GUARANTEE IT]]. <br />
Trolling said people will usually result in an [[ban|instaban]]

(It's also important to note that users will often [[circle jerk]] each other with their netsonas, resulting in so many comments that the page length may very well dwarf the [[Xbox]] in rare cases.

===Featured Image===
Some images on the site provide [[epic win|epic lulz]] to a level that deserves recognition. Others might ruin childhoods so mightily that they need exposure, or an image is of a [[Rule 34|34]] so rare, that it defies logic. Every so often, in indeterminate intervals, the featured image is changed. Titanium became the only admin who can feature images right before the string of Avatar features occurred .

There are [[OVER 9000|over 9000]] images that [[retard|members]] have spammed, demanding a feature of the pic. Said images usually have a high sexy rating, or are of [[furry|Renamon]] being pumped full of [[Fat|pig]] [[shit]]. These images are almost never chosen, just to [[troll|piss off]] the users.

==The Great [[Mexican|Puerto]][[Hentai|Pahealian]] [[War]] of [[Obama|'09]]==
This section is in the process of being made so please to be the not fucking touching it.

===[[Puerto_Rico|Alexander Santiago]]===
'''touched...'''

;Other aliases: jean-huertas, Carlitos-Belmonte, and carlitos-belmonte5
One day in a desperate attempt to get [[Pregnant|preggers]] a European visited a [[sperm]] bank, unfortunately there was a mix up and she wound up getting the sperm from a Mexican [[Furry|donkey]]. Upon birth his mother, sickened by his [[guro|grotesque]] appearance, sent him Puerto Rico in hopes that she would never see him again. Alexander was then [[fucked|adopted and raised]] by a group of animals called Puerto Ricans. At age 10 Alexander was sent to [[School|Kindergarten]], where he developed a [[loli]] [[fetish]]. Seeing as Alex was too [[retarded]] for regular kindergarten he was sent to a [[War|military]] school. Sadly Alex was also a [[nerd|weak]] [[ass]] [[midget|little]] [[bitch]] and was often subject to [[gay|be]][[sex|at]]ings from his classmates Jean, Carlitos, and some other kid also named Alexander. Scarred and [[Dying_alone|alone]] Alex turned to the [[internet]]. Having accumulated an unnatural amount of fetishes Alex soon found Paheal and became the semi-productive [[dick|member]] known as Carlitos-[[Castlevania|Belmonte]]. After [[180]] days on the site Belmonte's tiny [[balls]] finally dropped and he asked wiiaboo if he could become a [[moderator]] an hour later Belmonte received the Paheal rejection [[copypasta]]. Belmonte being the [[crazy]] fucker he is decided the only thing he could do was to claim to know [[Canadian]] [[pr0n|pornstar]] Ariel Rebel and then try take over the site in the name of [[Satan|Ariel Rebel]], blame it on the kids who rape him daily at school, and then become [[an hero]].

===[[Retard|Mrl274]]===
[[Image:Wutiswang?.png|right|thumb|What is a [[dick|wang]]?]]
[[Image:Mr Furry.jpg|right|thumb|A perfect example of Mrl274's AWSM art skillz]]
Mrl274 is probably the most retarded troll on Paheal. He came in and instantly made netsona's for members of Paheal who had none and also making a shit load of 34s of [[Scat|Rat]]. By making new netsona's Mrl quickly helped feed Paheal's cancer causing it to grow uncontrollably. Mrl274 would also leave comments that were so retarded that all people who read them had a drop in their [[IQ|I.Q]]. He has been b& over 9000 times each time coming back with a clone account, of course each clone just like in the movie Multiplicity is more retarded than the one before it.

{{quote|never i never give up... but seriously i dunno what a wang is, a plane of some sort is my guess for now|Mrl274}}

===[[Faggot|Thranos]]===	 
Perhaps one of the more annoying [[n00b|N00bs]] on paheal. He got [[b&]] for starting a tag war with Jeb over his shitty netsona, which happened to be a picture of Alucard with a crown. Soon after this b& Rule34d jumped in and make him his very own [[lies|original]] netsona. Two weeks later when the b& was lifted Thranos dragged his noob ass back onto the site. Thranos has been banned [[over 9000]] times since then putting him in the ranks with Mrl274 and if he is around when Mrl274 isn't then he is always the center of [[epic fail|epic phail]]. On top of being a [[troll]] [[faggot|Thranos]] is also an attention whore and was the one who created his sub-section in the first place and continually is editing it to make him self seem like more of a badass by deleting things like "when the b& was lifted" and replacing the word "dragged" with "snuck".

===[[Otaku|Otaku-san]]===	 
This troll came onto 34 trying to point out how certain things were not considered 34, like mermaids, and when I say he tried to point out I mean he bitched hours on end. Otaku-san after losing the battle to the namefags, mods, and anons Otaku-san started posting pictures of Greek Mythology shouting "IF [http://rule34.paheal.net/post/view/78130 >>78130] IS PORN THEN SO IS THIS!". Sadly for Otaku-san Paheal gladly accepted the pictures as 34 thus destroying the foundation of his argument. Otaku-san left Paheal for some time but came back to upload a pic after someone on [[7chan|7chan's /34/]] made fun of him. His picture was of a screen shot of the thread with a penis a above it and text below it saying "Poster # is a retard". The picture was deleted and Otaku-san was banned.

==Rule /35/==
A [[4chan]] esquire board based off of [[Rules of the Internet|Rule35]], Rule35 states that if there is no porn of it, it will be made. Even though it states nothing about requesting many users come onto the board requesting shit 24/7. It got so annoying that a separate sticky was made for requesting. Most washed up artists come to the board to bask in the flattery of other equally washed up members.

==The Rule34 Forum==
While not as boring as the Rule /35/ board, the Rule34 [[Forum]] is the [[ass|shit hole]] of Paheal as [[4chan]] is the [[asshole]] of the [[internets]]. 90% of the users on the forum are spambots the other 10% are made up of admins and the most [[weeaboo]] pieces of [[shit]] you've ever seen. Even though [[admin|admins]] and [[mods]] are constantly deleting spam [[spambot|spambots]] have been a prime concern of for [[drugs|users]]. To bad for them wiiaboo doesn't give two shits about the forum and has placed updating it to eliminate spam to the bottom of his to do list.

==The Great [[Toddlercon]] Purge==
On January 9, 2010, wiiaboo(woowoo) posted an announcement on the site's [http://rule34.paheal.net/wiki/Notes Notes wiki]:
:"''I'll cut to the chase. '''All (<s>[[lolicon]]/[[shotacon]]</s> read the update) toddlercon is going to be deleted over the coming months/year'''. The reason it will take so long is because there is a ton of content that has to go. Why you say? Well the reason is because such content is fastly becoming illegal the world over, there are currently a handful of countries that put lolicon on the same level as child pornography and prosecute its posession and distribution to equal effect, and while it is debateable, because there is no real children involved and there are certain artistic merits etc; if the law says its illegal then its just illegal.''
:''Now for the past few weeks you may have been noticing that images have been dissapearing, this is the reason. If you are wondering where some of your uploads dissapeared to, this is the reason. We usually hash ban the images and set the ban reason as "TK" standing for toddlercon because Toddlercon is the stuff we have been focusing on so far and sorry that "TK" is rather ambiguous but it will be made clear from now on. Therefor if you have read this, don't upload anymore content that might be considered too close to child pornography. We will give you a grace period of around a month where we will just delete the content as it's uploaded but after that we will start handing out bans. This is basically a new site rule from here on out.''
:''I know alot of you have strong views against this (present admins included) and dont agree with it but really, if its against the law then its against the law. And we certainly dont want to get on the wrong side of the law here. Just to be clear, for now we are focusing purely on purging the site of toddlercon (which danbooru describes as "'''A more extreme form of lolicon, revolving around very young children and even babies.'''" so yeah, you can see why that stuff goes first).''
:''Regarding the general "lolicon" images; that will be decided upon when that legal grey area clears up, because it is quite a large grey area at the moment. If you have any opinions on this, good or bad, then please email me at wiiaboo@paheal.net because i really want to hear what the userbase thinks as its a topic that websites like paheal are going to face into more and more in the future. Thanks for reading. - wiiaboowoowoo''
:''P.S. If you could help us out by reporting any Toddlercon you come across in your travels then that would be great.''
:'''''UPDATE:''' Just to clarify, for now toddlercon is the ONLY content we will be deleting until we can get a clear definition of what is lolicon and shotacon, you would be surprised how thin the line is." Revision 5 by wiiaboo at 2010-01-09 16:46:07.434157''

This revelation of course prompted some relevant [[rule34]] representing the situation (by '''Tomato''') which was quickly [[#Featured Image|featured]] by '''Titanium'''. The image, representing Paheal as the giant Phallus raping free speech, with the balls of society pushing it forward, quickly became a forum for dramatic discussion of anonymoi. The image depicted the manga page that inspired [[baby fuck]] all shaded out, plastered with words.
