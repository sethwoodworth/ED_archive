'''Losttrap''' (real name '''Ben Spurr''') is a [[Canadian|Canadan]] crossdresser who thrust himself into the [[chan]] community when he needed help smuggling illegal estrogen from the United States. He needed American [[Anonymous|Anons]] to order hormones online then mail them to his home address so his mommy and daddy wouldn't find out what a gigantic [[faggot]] he is and disown him. When this failed he resorted to posting '''fake''' pictures of himself to attract [[oxymoron|innocent anons]]. 

Although this did make him [[internet celebrity|quite popular and infamous on /b/]], no one wanted to donate time and money to help a prancing, prissy cunt. In desperation for feminizing drugs he posted pictures of his ass in various positions. His fame increased tenfold, but his wallet/purse/anal cavity remained empty.

Losttrap is mainly known as '''Bendilin''' on gaming sites. He can be found under that name on furfag sites like Sonic CulT and Fur Affinity. Losttrap may just rival CWC in his love of Sonic the Hedgehog. Lately he's taken up the tripfag name "Amy Rose" on chan sites. He can be even found at [[4chan]]'s [[v/|/v/]], bumping [[Minecraft]] threads and talking about nothing relevant to the thread.

Losttrap is living with his parents and currently having problems with his parents since his dad tried to beat him up but instead his mom got the hand.

==Past Drama==
As mentioned, before Ben Spurr became most known as Losttrap he was Bendilin. He used this alias in almost every site that caught his interest, including [[deviantArt]] and [[MySpace]]. There was even an Encyclopedia Dramatica [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Bendilin&action=edit&redlink=1 article] about him before this one existed, but it was nothing more than a [[Exhibit B|shitty attack article]] with no drama and was [[baleeted]].

Ben's main hangout spot was a [[Donkey Kong]] [http://www.dkvine.com/interactive/forums/index.php? fansite] where he would troll [[13 year old boys]] and bitch about [[shit no one cares about|how much he hated Nintendo & Mario]]. The last straw was when the [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]] website announced [[EarthBound|Lucas]] as a playable character, making Ben to fly into an [[Autistic|outrageous]] outburst as he believed Ness would be replaced by the [[blonde]] [[shota]].[http://www.dkvine.com/interactive/forums/index.php?showtopic=5294&st=5350&p=140052&#entry140052]

{{quote|Fuck Nintendo, fuck Sakurai, fuck Brawl, fuck everything relating to them. It's fucking EarthBound 64 being canceled all over again. I fucking hate these idiots and literally want to see them die.|Bendilin|welcoming Lucas' inclusion with open arms.}}

Of coarse, his bitching was completely in vain as Ness was later announced as one of the characters returning from Melee. The admins also caught on to his shenanigans and soon enough gave Bendilin the [[banhammer]]. He was later unbanned following a [http://www.dkvine.com/interactive/forums/index.php?showtopic=5484&hl= controversy surrounding another member's reinstatement], but had his account deleted by request. Sometime after [[Quitting IRC  forever|quitting the site forever]], Bendilin would become Losttrap.

==A Failed Scam==
Losttrap tried spending a few months befriending the community, which divided [[4chan]] into two very distinct groups; One that wanted to rape Losttrap, and one that wanted force feed him a tank of gasoline before sticking a flamethrower up his ass (10,000:1 ratio). He advised the uncountably small group that he was going to the Anime North convention this year and wanted to sit on as many dicks as he could find. Once there however, he and his group of lip-licking clowns were photographed and openly mocked, excluding the one dressed as [[Pedobear]].

Since that failure, Losttrap has left [[4chan]] and migrated to [[420chan]]'s /cd/ due to how retardedly modest and praising they are. For weeks he put on live cam shows which were overridden with advertisements for his online store and fucking awful drawings, most of which he would reuse due to a lack of new material. For whatever reason, he was able to trick fellow chan-whores andrea, Nicky-chan, and Ryo-chan into joining his cam show for a brief period in an attempt to up his status in the [[shemale|crossdressing]] community. 

After being banned from BlogTV for airing an unregulated amount of [[faggotry]] and getting kicked out of his parents' house he has been mooching off of his friends and any willing Anons he can find. It is assumed he is currently working as a male prostitute. A ''cheap'' male prostitute.
