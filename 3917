'''I accidentally (x)''' &mdash; where '''<nowiki>'x'</nowiki>''' = a noun of the poster's choice with the preceding transitive verb missing &mdash; is an [[Oh Exploitable]] meme of the [[textual]] variety, [[post|deployed]] in the same basic fashion as the [[pretty cool guy]] meme. Here, "accidentally" means "mishandled" in some manner; the point is to the noun at the end of the [[OP]]'s original above to something lulzy and the missing method of mishandling up to the minds of the [[peanut gallery]]. Bonus points are by adding a [[macro]] to illustrate what the missing verb might be.

==History==

In May [[2008]], many Anon were greeted by an OP who doesn't .rar files and verbs.

{{quote|hey /g/ I need your help

I accidentally 93MB of .rar files

what should I do...is this dangerous ?}}

Later that evening, another Anon - probably the same nitwit behind the Meriwether Speck trolls and the Catholic Cardinal trolls - resurrected the meme with the phrase "I accidentally 40lbs of mangoes." It was much funnier.  But not really.  

Most people are familiar with the OP having accidentally a whole coke bottle, however. A /b/tard tried to claim it was first posted on /b/ on the 20th, but failed miserably.

==[[Old meme]] status confirmed ==
On [[April Fools Day]] 2009, I accidentally X was confirmed as being stale and [[unfunny]] when [[Google]] included it on their image search page. Though in truth, it wasn't so funny before that either. It became even older and [[fail|unfunnier]] [http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090823051220AAIUzMa when this happened].
