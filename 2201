'''DerHexer''' or '''Keith Abbot''' is a gay scruffy [[Hitler|Nazi]] [[Nerd]] who is a wikipedo admin and a freak, a characterization with which '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DerHexer&oldid=151609348 many]''', '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DerHexer&oldid=149523517 many]''', '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DerHexer&oldid=156302487 many]''' people agree. He spends all of his fucking sad life fighting vandalism and when you vandalize his user page he likes to put you on your last warning. He has a striking resemblance to [[Angry German Kid]].

One day a sad [[YouTube]] [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=NHRHS2010 user] and [[Wikipedo]] (how sad can you get) decided to post a comment about DerHexer on a youtube video saying "Have you ever heardï»¿ of an administrator on Wikipedia known as DerHexer? He is very fast. If you want to know how fast DerHexer is, he have made more than 11,000 edits in one month in April 2007 and is making more than 8,000 edits on September 2007, mostly reverting vandalism. It took me 6 months for me to make 8,000 edits!" which shows how pathetic Wikipedians basically are and of course the comment on the video got a [[troll|trolling]] response. Only to reach his [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DerHexer&action=edit&autosummary=OMG%20I%20DID%20IT%20FOR%20THE%20LULZ!!!!11&oldid=149523517 talkpage] only afterwards were good lulz had by all.

When it's not protected, have a go at vandalizing this worthless wikipedo's [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DerHexer&action=edit&oldid=149523517 userpage].

[[PROTIP]]: DerHexer's router is still vulnerable to the [[DCC SEND startkeylogger 0 0 0]] trick. You can help him lose his virginity by kicking him from #wikipedia-de on [[freenode]] over and over again.

==RC Patrolling==
DerHexer is the world's worst [[Recent changes patrol]]ler.  Not content to just revert vandalism, he with his T3 connection in his mother's basement speeds through every single diff made by every single non-administrator user on the most hidden away talk pages far out of project space.  If there's even a chance he can get away with bullying someone by reverting them, he will take it.  What's worse is once he does so, an edit that normally would have been vandalism for someone else to be revert now gets a bandwagon of [[basement dwellers]] reverting any edit to that page for months.
