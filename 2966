Firefox Performance
[[File:Firefoxplugins.jpg|thumb|right|<s>Firefox has a wide variety of plug-ins and add-ons to help optimize your performance.</s>[[furry|Furfag propaganda]]]]

Here's a handy guide which should help to increase the performance of the [[Firefox]] web browser, by reconfiguring your configs and through the use of several handy add-ons.


__TOC__

== General Advice ==

*Disable and/or uninstall add-ons you don't use.
*Get an optimized Firefox build. Optimized builds for Windows can be found [http://weblog.pigfoot.org/pigfoot/ here].
*Decrease pagefile size if you have 2+ gigs of RAM.
*Use openDNS.
*If you download videos from YouTube to your hard drive and have pipelining turned on, video downloading may be noticeably slower.

== Config Changes ==

If a preference isn't available, right click in the "about:config" window and go to "New" > "Preference". Then, click on the type and enter values 'n shit. The guide at the bottom will tell you what type of value each entry is.

<pre>
network.http.sendRefererHeader				0
network.http.max-connections				100
network.http.max-connections-per-server			9
network.http.pipelining					true
network.http.pipelining.firstrequest			true
network.http.pipelining.maxrequests			9
network.http.proxy.pipelining				true
network.http.pipelining.ssl				true
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server	12
network.dnsCacheExpiration				2000
network.dnsCacheEntries					256
network.prefetch-next					false

browser.cache.disk.capacity				512000
browser.history_expire_days				7
browser.bookmarks.max_backups				2
browser.cache.check_doc_frequency			3

javascript.options.jit.chrome				true
javascript.options.jit.content				true
</pre>

=== What this shit actually does ===

<pre>
network.http.sendRefererHeader				decides what information is sent about where you came from (0=none). This can break some sites!
network.http.max-connections				max connections to all servers, useful to set high if you use abuse tabs.
network.http.max-connections-per-server			self explanatory, set to high and you = jew.
network.http.pipelining					send requests together, reduces packets sent/received and thus is faster.
network.http.pipelining.firstrequest			pipeline first request too (not supported microshit IIS pre-y2k).
network.http.pipelining.maxrequests			number of requests to server when loading a webpage, if too high makes you = a jew.
network.http.proxy.pipelining				turn on pipelining for proxies, this can really help sometimes.
network.http.pipelining.ssl				pipeline ssl too (can be more secure as well).
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server	self explanatory, again, if too high you = a jew.
network.dnsCacheExpiration				number of seconds to keep DNS entries in cache.
network.dnsCacheEntries					number of entries in DNS cache.
network.prefetch-next					grabs data you might not even need, also can hinder security.

browser.cache.disk.capacity				disk capacity in kilobytes.
browser.history_expire_days				number of days to keep history for (default of 180, I figure 7 is moderate enough).
browser.bookmarks.max_backups				max number of bookmark backups, helps speed up shutdown.
browser.cache.check_doc_frequency			how often the browser checks for a new version of the page.

javascript.options.jit.chrome				turns on tracemonkey for interface.*
javascript.options.jit.content				turns on tracemonkey for webpage.*

------------------------------------------------
Regarding the configs marked by an asterisk: These are values related to the plug-in Greasemonkey, which is the new / faster experimental javascript engine and which may not be available in all builds.
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
Just a quick note, if you = a jew then alarms might go off, or your requests might bounce.
The numbers I gave you are a lot fucking faster than the defaults, but won't bandwidth jew the host or make you look like a virus.
If you're extra cautious you could tone them down an integer or two if you want.

Alternatively, you can copy and paste the following script into notepad and save it to %APPDATA%\Mozilla\user.js to set all of the preferences for you.
