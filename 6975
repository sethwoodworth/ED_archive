'''Riana''' ([[IRL]] Riana K. Chakravarti) is a female bint, admin on [[TOW]] and a very fapable [[Australia|Aussie]] of [[India|Indian]] origin. When she was 17 she reportedly cheated on Daniel Bryant, as they both live in the same city, [[Adelaide]]. It is also known that she and [[Grawp]] have had it [[at least 100]] times. 

Riana discovered [[Wikipedia]] in [[2006]] and became addicted to it in [[2007]] like a [[World of Warcraft|WoW]] [[nerd]]. After making a certain number of e-friends such [[Alison]], [[Sceptre]], and later [[Phaedriel]], she asked to be made [[administrator]] and obtained the precious bit. For a year she [[lies|helped make the internet not suck]] but at the cost of quitting kickboxing to revert vandalism and eating more and more junk food as she spent hours in front of the PC every day.

She tried to commit [[wikicide]] in November 2007 because [[Jimbo Wales]] was [[you're doing it wrong|doing something wrong]] and set out to help [[shit|Veropedia]].
In 2008 she realized Wikipedia doesn't bring [[lulz]] and as such [[Quitting IRC forever|she went cold turkey]] after gaining 100 lbs of pure fat.
