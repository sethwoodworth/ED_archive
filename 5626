The '''NIU Valentine's Day Massacre''' seemed to come from a parallel universe. '''[[fail|Steven Phillip Kazmierczak]]''' entered a side door at approximately 3:00 pm CST near the front of an introductory oceanography class in a large lecture hall with 150 to 200 students and began to fire gunshots. The gunman was reported to be a thin, white male wearing a long, black '''trench coat''' and a black [[fag|beanie]]. Word on the street is he was a sociology major, that had something against the ocean. The gunman walked onto stage and opened fire. 18 people were shot before the gunman shot himself. Many victims were [[Headshot|shot in the head]], with at least three of the victims in critical condition, eight in stable condition and five in <s>good</s> [[dead]] condition.

The guy might have been [[butthurt]] over the fact that it's V-Day and instead of [[fap|masturbating]] using his [[emo|tears]] as lube he decided to [[pwn]] some students instead. [[Some argue|This is argued]] to be the latest attempt to break Cho's score at [[V-Tech]]. Too bad he failed miserably.

It must be noted that he didn't quite do it for the [[lulz]]. He did it for the luvz <3.

By the way, VDAY JUST KICKED IN YO!

==The perpetrator==

It's reported that the gunman was a current student of sociology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He had received the Dean's award from NIU in 2006. According to the NIU sociology website, coupled with the information provided in the Chicago Tribune article, the shooter can be identified as '''Steven Kazmierczak''', which is also confirmed by the academic paper referenced , "Self-Injury In Correctional Settings: "Pathology" of Prisons or of Prisoners?", co-authored by '''Jim Thomas'''. Kazmierczak was a graduate student at the School of Social Work, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who had received the NIU Dean's Award in 2006; he was Vice-President of the NIU Academic Criminal Justice Association in 2005 and had written on prison conditions and the U.S. correctional system. Local police and students who called local radio stations reported that the gunman was carrying two handguns and a shotgun. One of the handguns was believed to be a Glock, the other a small caliber handgun. The small-caliber handgun has not yet been recovered. [[Some argue]] Kazmierczak was a [[pussy|passive-aggresive]] [[faggot|closet case]].

Steve had an odd habit of collecting jobs with a high probability of [[rape|rectal trauma]] and proceeding to fuck up at them.

==A message from you, Steveo?==
<pre>
I Hope You Read This, Melissa
1st of all, what have i EVER done to you?

its obvious you have issues. anyone who knows 
you knows at least that. but more importantly, what have i ever done?

the last time we hung out was great. i dont get it.

unfortunately i didnt see your goodbye entry to me 
before you deleted it or something. by the way, why IS it gone?

it couldn't be because your argument was completely idiotic, 
and later when you tell others about this make sure u dont tell
 them i said you were idiotic; just your argument was. you are 
angry with me because i didn't tell you about christine, am i right?

well here is my rebuttal (forgive me for the spelling):
i dont need permission from you to date people.
i dont ever remember promising to tell you when i liked someone,
 but that should be no surprise to you because if you ever knew 
me you know i have a terrible memory.
even if i did promise that, it shouldnt matter.
you found out about us going out BEFORE I TOLD ANYONE! BEFORE I 
EVEN GOT BACK FROM THE BAND TRIP!!!!
besides we have been broken up for many months now.
i know you have problems with ex-bfs but its not like i left you 
to go out with her like someone else i know.
and its not like i've fucked a bunch of people since weve broken 
up like another person i know.

heres the bottom line:
i think your argument is absolutely absurd.
but i am not willing to give up on our friendship for something as
 silly as this.
please respond to this and remember that this is about your argument
, not you, so dont take offense.

[[Last Thursday]] some guy, possibly the shooter wrote racist shit on a wall.

Translated it said: "Tell thosse niggers to go home, i'm going to [[pwn]] them on December 10th at a place on campus. [[brb]], gun."

Like most [[negros]] he was late....two months late.

According to CNN, [[nigras]] were fleeing the campus like looters in New Orleans.

90% chance this was carried out by enraged [[Wikipedo]] hitmen in response to the butthurt caused by the [[Zoe]] / [[Professor Tim Pierce]] vandalism war. I mean, how many fucking professors could there be at a shitty, black person infested school like NIU?

SENT    : 15 February 2008 07:47
TO      : [FUCKING EVERYONE (literally)]
SUBJECT : MASSMAIL - Shooting at NIU


The University has learned that U of I student has been identified as the
gunman in a fatal shooting at Northern Illinois University that left seven
people dead and more than a dozen more injured. 

The entire University of Illinois family extends its deepest condolences to
the friends and family of the victims, and to everyone on the Northern
Illinois University campus affected by today's tragedy. Counselors from the
U of I are enroute to DeKalb to assist NIU's staff. And we will continue to
offer whatever assistance we can.

In the days to come it is important for all of us in the Illinois community
to come together to express our feelings concerning this horrible tragedy
and to share the grief that follows. We can expect to feel a wide range of
emotions. 

That is why I strongly encourage any U of I faculty, staff or student who
feels the need to seek counseling as a result of this tragic incident to
contact the Counseling Center.

Please remember that we are a community and, as such, we must continue to
care for each other. And, in dark moments such as these, we must turn
toward each other, not away.

Richard Herman

Chancellor

SUBJECT : MASSMAIL - Memorial Vigil/Northern Illinois Tragedy

TO:	Members of the Campus Community
FROM:	Richard Herman, Chancellor
	Justin Randall, President, Illinois Student Senate

On Monday, February 18, the University of Illinois is hosting a 
campus/community vigil that will begin at 9:00 p.m. on the north end of 
the Quad in the wake of the February 14 shootings at Northern Illinois 
University.

The memorial vigil will enable the campus community to express solidarity 
for our colleagues at Northern Illinois University.  A threat to any 
campus community undermines the educational environment which we strive to 
protect.  

Our deepest condolences go out to the families of the victims of the 
tragedy at Northern Illinois University.  We are especially saddened that 
a member of our campus community would commit such a violent and horrific 
act.  We will come together not only to lament the losses that were 
suffered at Northern, but also to renew our commitment to ensuring an 
environment where students, faculty and staff can live, learn and work 
without being threatened by the rage and hostility of others.</pre>

Translation: No, seriously, we really fucked up. :','(

==Possible warning signs==
[[Image:Vdayshoot.jpg|left|thumb|This card should have tipped off the authorities]]
The campus was shut down for a day in December 2007, during exam week, after graffiti was found on a restroom wall warning of a possible shooting. A spokesman said that the warning, which was discovered December 10, made reference to the [[Virginia Tech massacre]], which killed 32 people at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007. At that time that an unknown person posted the graffiti in the Grant Towers D residence hall, and that the graffiti included a racial slur and the notation, '''“What time? The VA tech shooters messed up w/ having only one shooter.”'''

==Possible warning signs II: The Quickening==
[[Image:Niu_shooting.jpg|right|thumb|[[b|/b/]] did it]]
[[Last Thursday]], [[Anonymous]] posted about his school getting shot up tomorrow.

==Video games being blamed?==

you mean to tell me video games are simulatorz?<B> [[video game|tellz me moarrrrrrrrr!!!!@11]]</B>

And the anchorperson's comments at the end are pretty lulzy. Apparently he's never heard of [[alcohol|good ol' Jack]].

==ZOMG GUN CONTROL!!!!11==
Expect black person or [[trap|Hillary Clinton]] to engage in warp three, [[goatse]]-worthy butthurt about guns in [[over 9000|under 9000]] minutes. 

==SCIFAGS DID NIU?==
Reportedly, he was [http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/02/15/university.shooting/index.html off his meds]. He stopped taking his [[anti-depressant]] because it made him "feel like a [[zombie]]" (Good call!)

==His (ugly) [[girlfriend]]==
His horse of a [[whore|girlfriend]], Jessica Baty (who didn't know shit) [http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/02/17/shooter.girlfriend/index.html#cnnSTCText spoke out to CNN.] Sadly, the shooter didn't [[pwn]] her ugly ass.
<center>[[Image:Jessicabaty.jpg]]</center>

Maybe if he had a hotter gf, he wouldn't have to become [[an hero]]. It's amazing the level of denial JB is in. If [[you]] find info on her, drop it like it's hot asap.

Prior to dying, Steve mailed off some packages to Jessica. Included in them were some bizzare shit, like [[TL;DR|Nietzsche]] and textbooks on serial killers, and a note (non-suicide related). However, if he was a true [[B|b-tard]], he would have sent her [[Hal Turner|thousands of spam and anchovy pizzas]].
