{{quote|It seems last week's Final Fantasy XIV kerfuffle had even more fallout than we thought. In an announcement on the company's official corporate site today, Square Enix drastically reduced its earnings forecasts for the remainder of the fiscal year from 12 billion yen (approx. $142.4 million USD) to just 1 billion yen ($11.9 million) - a decrease of 91.7%|N4G}}

:''Fun fact: This article went from a few paragraphs on the FFXI page to over 20,000 bytes in less than a week. [[GG]], Squænix.''

After the unveiling of the plans for '''''Final Fantasy 14''''' (a.k.a. ''[[Final Fantasy XI]] [[Electric Boogaloo|2: Electric Boogaloo]]'') many [[basement dweller|veterans]] wept e-tears at the realization that they will have to leave their old characters with the +20 wizard robe behind if they hope to transfer to the new game.  While Square-Enix blathered on about things like shorter level grinds, a less demanding experience, [[pizza]], [[cake]], and [[hookers and blow|numerous other attractive things in 14]], FFXIfags continued to lament over the imminent death of their crappy game. Some have even deluded themselves into thinking that 11 will survive the exodus of players into 14 by basing their argument off of SE's continued support of 11 (including a set of balance-destroying level increases), which is bullshit seeing as how SE simply wants to Jew before they have to [[Tabula Rasa|nuke the servers]].  What nobody seemed to admit is that 14 [[Truth|was gonna be the absolute same shit with different names]] and [[PS3|OMG soooo gewd grafix]]. However...

===Overhype?===

[[Image:Finalfantasyonlineraces1.jpg|thumb|right|Wow, look at the brand new races!]]
[[File:FF14_Funeral.png|thumb|right|FF14 has already been given a funeral. It's that awful.]]
In early September of [[2010]], nearing 14's release at the month's end, it was actually revealed that [http://www.massively.com/2010/09/05/pax-2010-wrassling-the-ffxiv-community-with-square-enix/ FF14 is going to flop horribly in the west.] [[Fanboy]]s jerk off to it, ignoring obvious problems such as poor [[mouse poop|mouse control]], the fact that a [[stupid|controller is almost required for the PC version]], no jumping (again), [[EQ2|shitty performance]], and small game world. Also the lead developers have never tried any other MMORPG, which is almost necessary for MMO developers to do - scope out their competition, compare and contrast. In fact, it's clear they never even tried their prior MMORPG given how they repeat many of the dumbest mistakes that used to plague that game.
[[File:Square_enix_stock.jpg|thumb|right|FFXIV almost crashed Squænix's stock value immediately.]]

Another common complaint are the races - as you can see, they're [[sarcasm|completely different]]. How Square can [[recolor]] their first MMO's old races and not come up with something new is a mystery on its own, especially seeing what they created in other games, such as the [[What|Yukes]] (some tall creatures with helmets on their faces.) Hell, [[EQ2]] has like 20 playable races, but then again it's made by [[opium]] addicts in [[California|SoCal]], so whatever.

===[[Owned|4.0]]===
While [[Gamespot]] has its own share of problems, FFXIV was rated an overall [http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/finalfantasy14/review.html?tag=topslot;title;1 '''4.0/10''' from the critics and fans in early October of 2010.] This is notable because it's a ''Final Fantasy'' game, and Gamespot reviews like everything in a scale of seven to nine. The review actually stated reasonable problems with the game that many have reported, not just what this article mentions a couple paragraphs above, but also how it takes too long to do fucking anything, the world being "on rails" (as in nothing much to explore, and grounded to the world in corridors, like FFXI), a poor targeting system that doesn't distinguish from party members and enemy mobs easily, unfinished stuff put in game as teasers such as chocobos, and super slow buff-casting times.

Needless to say, the fanboys claimed he had a shit computer, was paid by [[Blizzard]] (or to a lesser extent, [[Aion|NCSoft]] or [[SOE]]), and other faggotry. One fucktard claimed "hmm it seems whoever did the review was clearly a fan of [[World of Warcraft|WoW]], and likewise obviously never played ffxi..."

Also, GameTrailers.com rated it a [http://www.gametrailers.com/game/final-fantasy-xiv-online/11432 4.2/10] - for the same reasons. Shortly after, Gamespy gave them a [http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/square-enix-next-gen-mmorpg/1127142p1.html 2.0/5] and the long awaited IGN thrashing gave is a [http://pc.ign.com/articles/112/1123824p1.html 5.5/10]. Soon the bulk of reviews started to roll in, and so far the worst score it has gotten is a [http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/pc/final-fantasy-xiv/ 2/9]. Keep up the good work SE, you're going for a record!

{{quote|SE has six months to fix the game. That's when the PS3 version is released. 

If the game gets much better reviews on the PS3 side, people will take notice. If the PS3 version launches and it's still in terrible shape, FFXIV will be relegated to a niche market and will never achieve anything close to the larger appeal that SE hoped.

Six months SE, that's all you've got. Good luck.| Get to work fuckers.}}

{{quote|While there are forums and wikis full of people willing to puzzle these things out for you, "accessible" games shouldn't require a browser window open at all times. And even if you wanted to keep a handy reference open in another window, alt-tabbing in full-screen mode will crash the game. Sorry!|1UP}}

At first glance, the game's crafting system is one of its only pros. There are alot of crafting and gathering classes, tons of recipes and its different than any other game. But then you realize the crafting is like the rest of the game; the longer you look at it, the more you realize you're just staring at a picture of [[goatse]].

The first thing you realize is that you start to learn recipes fast, its as if you already know them and the game is just letting you know how to make them (P.S., this is true). The second thing you realize is that the menu is so shit you can't find your recipe book. The third thing you realize is it's not the Menu, the game is so fucking shitty, they force you to write down every recipe the game tells you or look at a third party website. Good thing they [[sarcasm|fixed the issue FF11 had with alt-tabbing to make this a painless process]].

So now you figured out a way to see your recipes. What now? You have your melee class to ten, so the first thing you want to do is make a weapon. Its either that or browse the wards to find a player selling one, which will take you around 4-5 hours to do. So fuck that, let's get to crafting. You crash your game and open the website with your recipes on it, and find a recipe for an AXE or SWORD or BOW. You write down the ingredients on a notepad and get to making them. 

[[File:Ff14_ign_saw.jpg|thumb|right|And this!]]

But what the fuck?? You realize that to make that lvl 8 axe you need to be level 11 BSer, well okay. You grind that shit out. Turns out you need axe head, but to craft it, you inexplicably need to be level 14, you don't understand this, but fuck you, the market wards suck big stinky Galka [[wang]]. Now you need a [[penis|shaft]] from a [[Jesus|carpenter]], some leather straps from a LW, some plate from an armorer, and some fucking [[Horse|glue]] from the alchemist. And probably a [[sandwich]] from the culinarian to feed [[you]]r [[fat]] fucking face while you craft this shit. Realizing you need 10-15 in like 7 classes to make a basic level 8 item, you go buy it instead.

Who are you kidding, you're a spergneck beardlord, so you get all the items together.

And it fails.

Oh, and failing broke your blacksmithing hammer because it lowers item durability.

==Crafting Part 2: Why the system is made by Sierra Games==

{{quote|PvP, keyboard shortcuts, an auction house, a sensible group chat system, a fast travel system that doesn’t break your bank, a map that actually shows you where things are… all these are missing presumed forgotten. Take the hardest quest in the game as an example. It’s called: ‘buying a sword’.|PC Gamer}}

After finally getting classes leveled, lots of mats and plenty of time wasted, you've made basic items hundreds of times. You haven't failed [[condom|sheep leather]] in a long ass time, and you need more. Why did you just fail it [[Rugrats|15 times]] in a row?

Because Square-Enix didn't tell you this shit:

'''Things that actually affect crafting:'''
*Character Facing
*Time of Day
*Day of the Week
*Moon Phase
*Arrangement of Abilities on your hot bar
*How many leves you have left

==RMT==

{{quote|They found the most valuable hard to find resource and are exploiting it. Market wards can't fix this. Not to mention other players are raising the price and the inflation rate on shards and crystals is so high it is impossible to craft unless you have a large LS that shares everything.|Sparker}}


[[Final Fantasy VII|Squænix]] pretty much [[Runescape|ruined the game to stamp out the Real Money Traders]]. They even went as far as making gil practically worthless because so much drops at once, and then having horribly shit vendors so there's nothing to buy from NPCs. Squænix says that the auction house allows RMT to flourish, and that retainers were the answer.

What actually happened though? [[Derp|Well they fucked up, that's what]]. Crafting is a very fundamental part of the game since nothing is sold on vendors, which means crystals are one of the major resources, and they are much more valuable and rare than gil. The problem is people buy them so fast that it will take hours to search the 200 retainers to find your shitty stack of wind crystals. So what happened?

The Chinese are now selling crystals for real money, and it's working. Why, you may ask? Because many people feel that paying some Chinese [[azn|sweatshop-nigger]] 5$ for a lot of crystals is better worth their time than farming them or trying to negotiate the horrible wards where you can barely see 10 retainers at once, so they're going to Chinese websites that act like the RMTs personal auction house. They buy a lot of crystals, and a China farmer personally delivers it to them on their little bicycle like a bag of take out. Over and done in 20 minutes.

Fucking Squænix.

|But perhaps the most distancing aspect of the game is its user interface. Rumored to have been designed by none other than producer Hiromichi Tanaka, the UI can only be described as maliciously incompetent. |1UP

|One of the most heinous interfaces ever devised|PC Gamer

</center>

One of the largest and most serious complaint about FFXIV is that it may as well not be a PC game. The game lacks features that have literally been standard inclusions since fucking 1989. The UI is probably the worst User Interface that has ever been in a PC game since the 1980s. You cannot remap buttons, and even if you could, the game doesn't have hotkeys for basic shit like your map or character sheet or inventory. [[Lol|You have to navigate a system of menus as if you're goddamn Magellan.]]

Worse than that, the most infuriating part of this stinky [[poop|turd]] that Square squeezed out onto the market is the fact that the UI lags. It's not because the game is crowded, or because their servers are shit (they are though), they literally programed the game so that every action you do takes [[Long|2-5 seconds]] to simply inform the server that you wanted [[Holocaust|some shit done.]]

|I dunno, it seems wrong that it takes longer to manage your inventory than fill it..|Neoterrar

|4 minutes is a long time to be selling vendor trash.|hairlessorphan

|Spells that take 30 seconds to cast don't seem to be a problem anymore - not because it's gone, but because it's dwarfed by much more severe problems, all attributable to the terrible server based gameplay SE has opted for.|Hotcakes

|There is a reason no other MMO has such a high level of server side gameplay computations and it's because every other developer realises that if they want the game to be successful, people actually have to enjoy it. SE keep saying they want to reach out to western markets, but they are too fixated in their 'you buy what we sell' mindset to actually encompass what that means.|Stupid Squænix

|It is kind of funny though that the basic design of the game isn't just frustrating players, it's also got the Devs working overtime just to figure out their own game.|Some Faggot

|color=#ffffff}}
</center>

But that's not even the worst part. I bet you're saying to yourself: Hey! Their servers are laggy, [[bullshit|they can optimize it later and it will be like every other MMO]]. 

Shut your goddamn mouth. It will never be instant like every other MMO. Barring a full rewriting of the games code, the lag is literally programed into the game, [[Serious|it will always be like this]]. 

When you talk about an online game, you have Server and Client side actions. Client side actions are (usually) things like the UI and your characters movement and animation. Things like this are irrelevant to the server, so you opening a menu happens as fast as your computer can display it. Square programmed almost everything in FFXIV to be based off of [[stupid|server side code]], meaning every single time you [[deviantART|craft an item]], open your inventory, stand up, [[Chair|sit down]], enter action mode, even basic animations done automatically, Square makes your computer ask their server's permission to do so. That means the info has to travel all the way across the world and get stuck in [[Japan|Tokyo]] city's awful traffic, get [[rape|raped]] in Akihabara, battle [[Godzilla|Gojira]], and come back before you can sell a fucking item.

Don't let any [[weeaboo]] ''Final [[Homo|Fagtasy]]'' fanboys tell you any different. ''Final Fantasy XIV'' was outsourced and developed by a Chinese sweatshop. 

The proof is pretty evident in the [[Japan|Japanese]] version. The entire game is littered with random [[Chink]]aboo words and sentences intermingled with the Japanese text. When they get to read native Japanese, there are blatant typos and mixed up words. Chocobo had been written as "horsebird" until release, where it is misspelled as "Chocopo". Mixing up "bo" and "po" is the equivalent of mixing up b and d, and only a [[retard]], [[dyslexic]] person, or uneducated [[Chink|sweatshop-nigger]] would mix it up. Another nugget of [[truth|proof]] is the fact that the game is missing virtually any ''Final Fantasy'' classes. Some of them are just renamed, but many are outright gone. Ninja and Samurai are gone, and removing them is China's revenge for WW2.

At least they did not call the Chocobo a "HorseCock"

More damning evidence is the Fatigue System and guildleve (yes, guildleve, whatever that is) restrictions. Reviewers and gamers who are playing this piece of shit all have the same universal complaint, "Why the fuck did SE think these were good ideas?" They didn't, but Chinese law mandates anti-addiction systems be put in place. Case closed.

By the way, enjoy moldy "collector's items" as reported [http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2010/09/23/final-fantasy-xiv-made-in-china-quality-goods/ here.]

'''1.''' This game is the real deal. Face it, most people will not have what it takes to play it. The purpose of this game is not to entertain, it was made entirely to scare of the dumbed down masses and cater only to the selected elite of online gaming. Only the few, chosen people who are blessed with the soul of the warrior can stand up to the challenges this game offers. It is the definition of a real mature, complex game only for the most dedicated and talented. 

If you are not one of them, then tough luck for you mate, but remember;  you have no right to complain about anything in the game because it is not the games fault that you're a total fail who cant stand a real MMORPG. Guess what? Square-Enix don't even want you to play their game, inferior one. Go back to WoW.


'''2.''' If you don't think a game should require you to use a walkthrough or wiki page to find out the locations of vendors, Quest givers or other important NPCs and locations, you are a lazy, spoiled little child and must immediately go back to WoW (which obviously is your favorite game, kiddo) . You are not worthy of playing ''Final Fantasy XIV''. The same rule applies to game mechanics such as interface, combat and crafting. If you are too stupid to figure out how these things work by yourself,  GTFO. Square Enix shouldn't have to bother with making tutorials just because you're to lazy and stupid to figure things out.

'''3.''' Real hardcore gamers (aka worthy human beings) don't require ingame rewards for them to keep on playing. Mounts? Such vanity is only implemented  for lazy impatient people who cant face the test of endurance. Quests? a true passionate gamer does not demand such a luxury.  1 story mission each 5 levels is more than enough and it is disrespectful and demanding to ask for any more. 

'''4.''' In general, it is always  the customer who should adapt to fit a product, not the other way around. The paying customer has no right to voice their opinions on the product they are paying for.

{{quote|Final Fantasy XIV is so deeply flawed that I can’t even see how future updates could redeem it.|PC Gamer}}

''Final Fantasy XIV'' is a game that took Squænix five years to make, and [[Engrish|tens of mirrions of dorrars]] to fund. They have stated that it will take five years of profits to make up for their expense, which means they probably weren't even considering adding content or anything to the game until the [http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/critic-reviews/ playerbase and media told them how good their game was]. Make no mistake: Square-Enix doesn't care about [[you]] or the game itself, only money.

That's irrelevant though, Blizzard only cares about money too. The difference is, Square-Enix thinks the best way to make money is to make the playerbase so mad money shoots from their ears. Squænix wont let this game die, even if it means keeping a single server up to make up as much money as they can back.

Another thing to realize: [[What|Retainers cost 1$ to own on your account.]] This is not simply their incompetent price team thinking we like to pay more for useless features.

The only reason the [[The Man|bigshots]] at SE even considered adding a free month is because they panicked. As soon as the game released, they were all drinking squid ink alcohol and partaking of fresh [[loli]] in their penthouses because they honestly thought the game was fantastic, but when they heard that the game was gonna tank, freaked out and put their lolis away and the only thing they could think of was to give people more time, since [[Americans]] love Jew [[crap|stuff]].

As of now, Square revamped the markets and [http://www.massively.com/2010/10/15/final-fantasy-xiv-grants-players-a-month-of-freedom/ is giving those who bought the game an extra free month of play] because players are jumping this sinking ship in droves. Also, a director's dispatch states that they plan updates to the game every three months, as they know they fucked up and now scramble to fix this mess of a game with things that should have been in it from the start.

That's not all for the future of Square.  [http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/chart?symbol=9684.T Square Enix's stock price halved in two years], and it's just not in two years there has been a drastic change in their jew money, this decline has been going on for five years.  So, as you can see, Square Enix isn't gonna survive long if it keeps releasing shitty games such as this one.

[[File:SE5-years.png|thumb|This is the 5 year change.]]

[http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2010/11/05/square-enix-ff14-is-a-disaster-weve-lost-player-trust/ The CEO of Square Enix has admitted that FF14 is a disaster and they lost the players trust]. (Who's even [[you|playing]] it?) 

{{quote| The FF14 service is currently unsatisfactory, we’re trying to improve it as rapidly as possible. We’re trying as hard as we can to regain lost trust.  If we satisfy the users who left us, they’ll come back. On the other hand, if they think it’s irredeemable, there’s no future for it. We’ll do everything we can to recover that trust.| CEO Yoichi Wada}}

Even though the game sold about 630,000 copies since launch (190,000 in Japan, 210,000 in the US and 230,000 in the EU) only about 30,000 people are still playing it.  

There are more people playing [[FF11]] then there are people playing FF14, at least the FF11 [[fanbois]] are smart enough not to migrate to a shittier game.
