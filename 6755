RIKI-OH
[[Image:Splodinhead4ju.gif|frame|Don't mess with the Gang of Four!]]

'''''RIKI-OH''''' (Also known as ''Ricky oh'' or ''Story Of Ricky'') is quite possibly the greatest movie of the [[90s]] and a favorite among [[/b/tards]]. In the distant future of [[Last Thursday|2001 AD]], prisons are privatized and controlled by meat bags who have super [[ninja]] techniques. The protagonist of this [[epic]] is Ricky, a mild-mannered man who has mastered the art of QI-GONG: a technique that affords him superhuman strength and the ability to '''[[The Doom Comic|RIP AND TEAR]]''' his foes.

'''[[PROTIP]]:''' Watch the movie with [[Engrish]] dubbing enabled for extra lulz.

== Story ==

Ricky is put into a maximum security [[prison]] for taking revenge on drug dealers who [[allegedly]] killed his girlfriend, when in reality she was an [[aspie]] twit who [[suicide|self-pwned]] by running off of a building. Upon his arrival at the prison, a security X-ray indicates that he has bullets in his chest that he keeps as "souvenirs". This amazing revelation foretells how truly badass this guy is.

Within a short time, Ricky realizes that the prisoners are being beaten, [[raped]], and horribly oppressed. The line is drawn for Ricky when he discovers that his jailers '''handcuff the dead'''. At this point he goes [[batshit insane]] and vows to make this the most [[violence|violent]] movie in existence. He learns that the prison is run by the ruthless Gang of Four, each of whom controls a different wing of the prison. 

The Gang of Four are:

*A tattooed man who strangles people with his intestines when he commits [[Wapanese|HARA-KIRI]].
*A meaty bastard who goes around smashing heads
*A man who fights with a sewing needle and [[lol Wut|gets shot in the ass by a giant handgun that shoots exploding bullets]], thus resulting in the most enormous [[butthurt]] [[EVAR]].
*A gigantic [[faggot]] who grows opium. (Interesting fact: The actor who plays this character is actually a woman, like a reverse [[tranny]]; whether this is [[awesome]] or [[gay|ghey]] has yet to be decided.)

From this point on the movie is filled with epic amounts of violence, [[animal abuse]] (a dog getting kicked in half), children who get their tongues cut out and skinned, exploding heads and other [[lulz]]y maneuvers. The assistant warden, a man with a hook hand [[Wut|who keeps mints in his glass eye]], tries to get the Gang of Four to kill Ricky and put an end to his prison riot.

Ricky manages to kill some of the Gang of Four, but is then caught, tortured and buried. He then frees himself with energy gained from eating a dog's liver, and proceeds to punch peoples' limbs and heads apart.

== The Final Boss ==
When the Gang of Four is thoroughly [[pwned]], the prison warden shows up and wants to fight Ricky because "To be the prison warden, one must be the very best at kung-fu".  Prior to this assertion, he kills his assistant warden and the last Gang of Four member with his special gun that has [[inflation art|'''bullets that inflate people until they explode]]. Holy fucking shit.'''

The warden then turns into a horrible [[plastic crap|styrofoam monster]] and kicks the shit out of Ricky until he remembers his master's words: "QUI-GONG feeds off of strength and gets stronger!" enabling him to suddenly have the sufficient strength to punch through the monster. After tossing the warden into a meat grinder, Ricky [[Falcon Punch]]es a hole in the prison wall and yells "YOU ARE ALL FREE NOW!" releasing hundreds of [[pedophiles]], [[rape|rapists]] and [[murder]]ers back into society. [[Awesome]].

==[[Butthurt|Criticism]]==
Due to it's general awesomeness, RIKI-OH is often criticized as being unrealistic and uninspired. Furthermore, its plot was questioned due to the fact the prisoners are allowed to just walk around and [[rape]] each other without anybody giving a shit, and the fact that the really [[gay]] villain kicks a dog in half effortlessly. People also stated that the Warden transforming into a [[Giant enemy crab|monster]] at the end was unneeded and didn't even make sense.

Actually, disregard all that; this film is perfect.
