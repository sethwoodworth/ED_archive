== Customer Drama ==
A 200 page, short epic, of Vistaprints business ethics is located at [http://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/vistaprint.html ConsumerAffairs]. Vistaprints management is laughing their ass off, and so can you. Each page has about 300 dollars of complaints... that makes up 60.000 dollar; but thats nothing compared to the worldwide value of lulz generated daily.

Here are some random snippets:

* Paying 225 dollar for 250 FREE businesscards! "''Just like all of the customers listed before me, I placed one order for 250 free business cards over a year ago and paid for shipping costs only to find out that I was being billed monthly for 14.95 until this month and the amount jumped to 17.95. I did not agree to do anything but accept the 250 free cards in exchange for the shipping costs. [[cool story bro|I've paid over 225 for nothing]].''" -- [http://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/vistaprint.html#ixzz0hromF2pC '''Brooke of Enterprise, AL February 26, 2010''']

* Free email: "''I ordered a "free" one month e-mail marketing and website, and guess what? I can`t cancel it. There is no phone number or e-mail contact to do so!!! Thnk you I didn`t order the business card too''." -- [http://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/vistaprint_p3.html#ixzz0hrrzslIG '''Adam of Beverly, MA February 3, 2010''' ]

* Quality Products!: "''I bought business cards - mat finish. They look like they were printed on a home computer. Illegible and poorly "papercut." You get what you pay for. Shoddy on every level.''" [http://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/vistaprint_p3.html#ixzz0hrsZ6BCC '''JIM of ANN ARBOR, MI January 14, 2010''']

Some other quotes from the pool, copypasta'd uppercase messages:
* This is a blatant RIPOFF!
* NEVER EVER USE VISTA PRINT AGAIN. 
* SPAM - TWICE a DAY
* DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!
* THREE WEEKS LATER I got my 14 bucks back.
* And etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, ad infinitum.
