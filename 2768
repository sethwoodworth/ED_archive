Exploding Whale
This is an [[old meme]] in the form of a video, in which a highway construction crew uses far too much dynamite to blow up a beached whale.  The whale in question was not a [[fat whore]], however.  When the whale exploded, blubber flew all over, smashing cars and hitting people.  The video is of the poorest quality imaginable, as it was created [[at least 100 years ago]].
