Pic Unrelated
[[Image:PicUnrelated.jpg|thumb|right|<strike>It's almost always unrelated, I mean, what topic can you derive from this?</strike>Exotic interspecies bedboxing]]

'''Pic unrelated''' is a [[meme]] started by /[[r]]/tards who wanted to request something on /r/ but were [[lazy|too fucking lazy]] to dig up a single example, therefore making it worse for themselves, since an example would help more [[anonymous|anons]] -who don't know much about the subject- to chip in. In the beginning, they simply uploaded a totally random picture, while adding "pic unrelated" as text next to it. Since then, different pictures have been created with "pic unrelated" captions, some of them highly surrealistic. /b/tards copied them of course, and used them as a means of starting obnoxious discussions on /b/, because who browses the text boards anyway? And let us not forget the [[unfunny|-predictable-]] variations of the [[meme]], such as "pic semi-related" or "pic definitely related".

==[[stupid|Clever]] Subversions==

A nasty side effect of having an unrelated picture, [[fag|Dashing young]] [[Gentlemen|rogues]] looking to make a name for themselves may ignore the text of the post altogether and focus on the awesome pic the [[OP]] just posted. 

I mean. Look at that lady. Uppercutting cats and [[Pretty_cool_guy|doesn't afraid of anything.]] What the fuck! [[Awesome|:awesome:]]
