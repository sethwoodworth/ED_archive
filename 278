'''Aeralik''' ([[powerword]]: Christopher [[Poland|Kozak]]) was a whiny [[SOE|developer]] for the [[MMORPG]] ''[[EverQuest II]]''. He is known to have sex with players at conventions and make every class worthless whenever he feels like it. Rumor has it that he is a [[transvestite]]. However, [[nobody cares]] about the transvestite and the sex part, because he "[[Pwn|nerfed]]" (see: castrated) classes in EQ2 and tried to make his own favorite class (an [[Columbine|assassin]]) better. He's also disliked for getting [[EQ2Flames]]' fansite status revoked in March [[2008]], all because...

# A player posted Aeralik's character's name on the EQ2Flames forums.
# Aeralik, who [[accidentally]] was given mod powers, [[Delete fucking everything|deleted]] said post.
# LFG told him that he wasn't supposed to have mod powers, but he'd [LFG] take the hit for the deleted post from EQ2Flames users.
# LFG created a poll to see if developers should have their character info outed or not.

{{quote|sorry but if you want to increase your ad revenue at my expense with that gay poll then im done. I just wanted you to deal with [[Guruubii#TWO_DD.27S_FOR_THE_NEW_DEVIANT.21_IT.27S_THE_SERVERS_FAULT_I_SAY.21|one immature posted]] but this is fucking retarded and even more childish. keeping fucking people over at soe i see how it is and then you wonder why people hate your site there.|Aeralik, one immature posted}}

This could very well be the reason why the [[EQ2Flames#The_LFG_versus_Grimwell_Incident|LFG vs. Grimwell incident]] happened. Needless to say, a lot of [[EQ2]] players decided that both [[Grimwell]] and Aeralik were huge jackasses.

==The "Fire Aeralik" Petition Thread==
On February 19, [[2009]], a user called Cracatoa made the [http://www.eq2flames.com/general-gameplay/40653-fire-aeralik-petition-thread.html "Fire Aeralik" petition thread]. Somehow, Aeralik was soon demoted and his job was given to a [[woman]] called [http://www.eq2flames.com/general-gameplay/40653-fire-aeralik-petition-thread-19.html#post867849 Kirstie]. Eventually, a former EQ2 developer called Locke [http://www.eq2flames.com/general-gameplay/40653-fire-aeralik-petition-thread-25.html#post869238 posted about his experience working at SOE. Apparently, there are a lot of office politics in the gaming industry. It's not about what you know, but who you know.]

As of 7/13/09, Aeralik got his job back because [http://forums.station.sony.com/eq2/posts/list.m?topic_id=454839 Kirstie was transferred to work on SWG]. Maybe [http://www.eq2flames.com/everything-else-everything-else/47743-official-fan-faire-09-picture-thread.html Aeralik and Gage getting close at Fan Faire 09 had something to do with it.]

==Aeralik Quits==
[http://www.eq2flames.com/general-gameplay/54997-aeralik-gone-2.html#post1155242 In early November 2009, Aeralik has quit SOE because of management decisions he did not agree with, that made players hate him.] While this is understandable, it does not prevent him from being made fun of for [[Guruubii#Accident_Retard|one immature posted]].

{{quote|As a [[Christian]], I forgave Aeralik for the completely unnecessary [[Drama|bullshit and harm]] he caused to me and this site.

I wish him the best and hope he learns to control himself better and think more clearly in the future.|[[LFG]]; on [http://www.eq2flames.com/general-gameplay/54997-aeralik-gone-5.html#post1155441 forgiveness]}}

He now works on [http://www.trionworld.com/games.php ''Rift''], which, according to Hoss of EQ2Flames, ''"sounded like an MMO aimed directly at homosexuals. I mean moreso than [[Aion]]."''

On March 12, 2009, [http://www.eq2flames.com/general-gameplay/61014-did-fyreflyte-leave-eq2-5.html#post1268924 Aeralik returned to post about his shitty job experience.] He mentioned ''"After that I started to stand up for [[Islam|what I believed]] earlier which led to conflicts with the new leadership and ultimately to me leaving."'' Later Aeralik mentioned that the March 2008 drama bullshit went something like this:

{{quote|There is no real good gossip to be honest. They asked me what happened. I said I modded a thread with access given to me for that reason. After that I had no further input in the situation and the powers that be did what they felt was right. It's all pretty boring honestly and was just way overblown from nothing.|Aeralik; on boredom}}

==Advice Aeralik==
Even Aeralik gets to join the ranks of [[Advice Dog]]!
