EVKWIA…  οὐχ ἡδύ;
EVEN VIKINGS know “whom” is Accusative!  (Pretty cool, huh?)
An presentation given at LULZCON on 9/29/2007.
By Mark Miner 
AKA  “Didaskalos” 

* '''Slide 2'''
Iluv2surf outs me, I out him.  Iluv2surf is a cop who has made a website  giving out personal info on more than 30 “hid people.” (Scooby-snack for first person to figure out that anagram. Raise hands!!!)  He got me fired from my first teaching position.His site is thoroughly unprofessional  and mean-spirited.  He often brags about his own intelligence and skill in identifying others, but wants to remain anonymous himself.  Since he has outed many people and is carrying on like a cyber-bully, it’s time to out him.  I have started this process by deploying my superior language skills.  You can help!

* '''Slide 3'''
Fun With Anagrams! 
From the letters P  E  D  O  P  H  I  L  E . . .
Hid People.
He lied, Pop!
I Old, He Pep!

I’m a ped.  Deal with it.	
If you guys can’t talk about ped issues in an adult way, then I’m completely prepared to don black-face and a frizzy afro wig and do some old-fashioned, really offensive minstrel-show schtick, RIGHT NOW, so don’t push it.
The Congo, by Vachel Lindsay
Wizard Oil
Nothing like a Minstrel Show!!
AND DON’T GIVE ME ANY TROUBLE,OR I’LL TURN OUT THE LIGHTS AND START RECITING BEOWULF.
(And you don’t want to be alone in the dark with an angry pedophile getting his GRENDEL on.)

* '''Slide 4'''
The  Catastrophic Differential �Calculus of LULZ:
Let HD = Heroic Dignity
HDmax = the bright, clear images found in Heroic Poetry
HDmin = public exposure as a pedophile.
Define Qlulz = dHD  /  dt
Thus,  Qlulz max = Maximum CHANGE in HD over Minimum of time.
If this is over your head, think of a guy slipping on a banana peel and falling.

* '''Slide 5'''
The Integral Fail Calculus of Pedophilia.
The masculinity function  “M(t)” assigns a value to the performance of the various socially-assigned, age-appropriate tasks of male maturation.
E.g., Two-year old boys run away from mommy and run back; 17-year old boys have to get into college.  
The Heroic Success Integral adds up all the positive developmental experiences between ages 2 and 17, representing the positive, though socially ranked, achievement of a masculine identity.
The Fail Integral of Pedophilia represents the negative sum of all the negative experiences of the Pedophile’s so-called boyhood.
Since the formative experiences of heterosexual boyhood (like fighting back against bullies and preliminary investigation of the opposite sex)  are both absolutely necessary and utterly impracticable after a certain age….
The value of the Pedophile Fail Integral is:
(math formula) integral sign 2-17 M(t) dt = - infinity

* '''Slide 6'''
Basic Theory of “Hid People.”
Hurdles of masculine development NOT jumped over…….but you can’t escape them!
Cyclic nature of psychic development:  those hurdles that the ped didn’t jump over at 10, come back to haunt him at 50, in the form of an interest in boys who are trying to deal with those same conflicts in THEIR lives.  
Peds THEORETICALLY could be helpful to boys going through these challenges, but generally aren’t,  because they haven’t had the guts to ask older men for help with THEIR OWN issues.  Instead….
Characteristic Prolapsed Emotionality.   (See pic next slide.)
I’m “Watching Blue Cartoons”  When I see MY ISSUES in YOUR BOY. 
(E.g.,  Story of 2-year in shopping cart.)
From “Childlike Achilles” by W. Thomas MacCary.  Pedophilia:   To be in love with the excellent image of you in your mother’s eye.

Most of us have pretty clear images of what “Hid People” look like.

Sad, dark, baggy eyes from staring at Child Pornography.
Smirky, scary, devouring mouth
Personal grooming on the ratty side.
Skeevy hands, slimy handshake.
Images of salt-vampire from early Star Trek

5 True Warren Cup Myths I Made Up.		
For Hid People, the Warren Cup is like the Holy Grail, or Green Lantern’s Lantern.  
According to an ancient mystical tradition which is at least a hundred years old, every time an Evil Hid People abuses a little boy, the Warren Cup is there to catch the pain.
Thus, the Warren cup CURES your Butt-Hurt, because the Warren Cup KNOWS your Butt-hurt.
Once a year, the Hid People meet at the British Museum and take an Oath on the Warren Cup, and this gives them the power to shrink themselves to six inches tall, fly around at night on little bat-wings, and sneak into the window of your child’s room, if you leave it open more than six inches.
The Warren Cup LOOKS as though it is made of silver; in fact it is not.  The silver-plating covers a cup made entirely of metal smelted from an asteroid…
THAT FELL FROM PLANET BUTTHURT!
Warren, a wealthy Boston Boy-Lover and Art- Collector, wrote a little book called  “A Defense of Uranian Love.”
If you can call a pedophile’s privately-printed FAIL rant a “book.“
Uranian love, of course, is love that takes place in Uranus.
One of my current projects is to translate the Greek & Latin quotes for a reprinting of this book.
NOT Pasiphae & the Bull, Brian!
Didaskalos, aka Mark Miner in Poetic Drag,�publically acting out teh boy-drama, not being a hid “hid people.”�(All your boys are belong to me!)�(I’m doin’ poetry in your kids’ classroom, changin’ their m00dz!)�

* '''Slide 15'''
How does Didaskalos act out �teh boy-drama?
Beowulf Sock-Puppets	
I play Grendel who wants to EAT the sleeping Danish dudes. 
 I play Beowulf, who kills Grendel.  
This is how I externalize the conflict in my soul:  part of me is socially-oriented (Beowulf) , part of me is an outright monster. (Grendel)
Iliad Sock-Puppets.
Achilles is the boy with the fragile self-image.
Agamemnon is the bigger boy who tells him he is no good.
This is the same drama I went through with the psycho minister’s son who abused me.

* '''Slide 16'''

Feburary 2000:
Bacause of someone’s anonymous tip, I get called in the San Diego Education Center and canned from my teaching position.
My girlfriend dumps me.
My car gets taken to the dump.
My credential is still valid, so I do substitute teaching all around San Diego County.
I begin my job search nationwide.
SIX YEARS PASS.

* '''Slide 17'''

February 2000 – June 2006
I hear nothing, am told nothing.  
Principal of La Jolla “can” tell me nothing.
“You’ll be receiving a letter.”
Two months later, I receive notice that I have been put on some kind of list by the San Diego police department.
I have been speaking rather frankly in my “post-gay Christian support group” where I am “learning to trust my male peers” so that I can “overcome unwanted same-sex attractions.”  I’m pretty sure one of them ratted me out.

June 2006: Iluv2surf’s website makes me FAMOUS ON THE INTERNETZ!!
URL:  www.blogspot.Iluv2surf.    Look it up on your fap-tops now!!!
He’s a cop who spends his days scouring the net for data on sex offenders.
Loves to talk trash about perps
Loves to disparage their intelligence
Don’t miss his priceless remarks on “Didaskalos!”  
The section on Gort’s suicide, while painful to read, is important to my argument.
Says all peds should commit suicide, and disparages IBLD.
Say, what would happen, nowadays, if a cop assigned to work in a black neighborhood was found to be making a HATER website using  the data he gathered at work?   In which he repeatedly stated, “All niggers should die, and Kwanzaa is lynching day!”

* '''Slide 20'''
EVKWIA…ouch hedy?
November 2006: �The Great BoyChat take down.
Doesn’t happen.
The Anti’s all try to gang up and drive BoyChat line.  THEY FAIL.
Luvvy makes many really rude posts about Tangie, Gort, and PPC.
I decide, in the midst of all the drama, that Iluv2surf is a big-mouthed jerk, and that I can probably figure out who he is, if I read and analyze all his prose.

* '''Slide 21'''

Let’s look at the stylometric evidence.
On his website, Iluv2surf uses the relative prounouns WHO and WHOM 53 times.  (Ignore Interrogatives)
Sort by Subject/Object, Correct/Incorrect.
Totals for the 4 categories.  
1)  Subject   Correct:       who         41
2)  Subject   Incorrect      whom      9
3)  Object    Correct:        whom      2
4)  Object    Incorrect:      who          1
Conclusion:  Luvvy misuses “whom” for “who” about 1 in 5 times.

* '''Slide 22'''

When the relative pronoun “who” is called for, luvvy uses….
What is the base-line for making this error in English prose, 2000-2007?
To do a proper stylometric analysis, I would need to know how often people use “whom”  instead of “who” for the subject of relative clauses in normal prose.  
Since I have a life, I have not had a chance to consult a stylometric expert, or look up a random sample of 1000 relative clauses calling for a SUBJECTIVE relative pronoun,  and see how many times WHOM is used instead of WHO.  I expect, though, that the figure would be less than ONE IN ONE THOUSAND.
For crying out loud, if you google “whom,” you find that MANY ENGLISH USERS consider the word obsolete, even where it is SUPPOSED to be used, and that only the persnickety still use it, in FORMAL WRITING ,as the OBJECT of a relative clause.  I googled “whom Sacramento” and found 52 uses of  “whom”, NONE of which were as the subject of a relative clause.  Google as much as you want to; normal writers simply don’t make this error!
But  Luvvy, at the rate observed on his website, would make the error 180 times per 1000 clauses!  A rather remarkable and “marked”  characteristic of his prose style.
The fact that no normal person uses “whom” as the SUBJECT of a relative clause is a reflection of the fact that nowadays PEOPLE GENERALLY DON’T USE WHOM AT ALL.  
To put it simply, “WHOM” is a  dead word that only Latin teachers who understand the accusative case ever cared about.  Until NOW!  Because the incorrect use of “whom”  marks Luvvy’s prose like 
an exploding red dye-bomb marks a bank-robber.

Iluv2surf:  Serial Offender!
WARNING:  THESE EXPLICIT, REPETITIVE IMAGES
MAY BE OFFENSIVE TO MANY, AND ARE NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!
Images referenced by a date alone 
are found on Iluv2surf’s  blog:

Referenced 9/2007
http://iluv2surf.blogspot.com/�10 August 2007
“Thank goodness there are some in law enforcement, such as with the FBI and US Marshal's office whom understand what reports mean. Some know what they're doing.”
“Wake up... and don't knock those whom could do your jobs better than you and with better results.”
http://iluv2surf.blogspot.com�1 Dec 2006
“Your post affirms what we have known for a very long time. Don't worry that you did something wrong by posting for pedos to also see that you, too, know whom "Tangie" is in Real Life (RL).”
“He also led to us learning the ID of his former YF, "Teraniel." (No, we won't be sharing info. about "Teraniel" here; he was exploited amply by Ian Hodgson, whom threatens to kill himself in an attempt to evoke a response from his fromer YF.”
“If he does it, it's not anyone else's problem - unless he does a "Gort" in a park where kids might see him hanging. That is trauma... and becomes a prob. for kids whom will see him dangling :(.”
Note the interesting correlation:	
Luvvy is SO EXCITED by Gort’s suicide, and has so much fun describing how Gort hung himself from a tree in a park by tying an extension cord around his neck, that he makes his characteristic error three times.
Tacky, Luvvy, Tacky.
The Boychat community loved Gort.

* '''Slide 24'''

In his 1 Dec 2006, comment:   Iluv2surf makes this stunning appeal to stylometrics:
“…most likely, PPC will change his nick. No prob. there. He has a distinct writing style.” 
YA THINK?
NOTE:  COPS evidently do not have distinct writing styles.

http://iluv2surf.blogspot.com
30 Nov 2006:  “Instead, Ian Hodgson ends up the "point man" for pedos whom rape boys and end up incarcerated. “
(comment to) 29 Nov 2006  “For anyone whom may think that Smith had not been previously reported (and with probable cause), please re-think”
5 Nov 2006  “Jim is a man whom is into boys; he's a pedophile - after all. “

* '''Slide 25'''

I compared to Luvvy to Mike Echols� (a famous anti-ped activist who came to a bad end)  in a boychat post….
Luvvy responds….
ILuv2Surf said... The major prob. with the man is not only that his info was often flatly wrong, but that he also had a criminal record of child abuse and (was previously convicted felon) wanting to take child porn into Canada. He had something like 5,000 images when he was stopped at the U.S.-Canadian border and barred entry. (His cache of child porn was seized.)  Even with authorization to work as agents for law enforcement: Neither Proud2B nor I have collected child porn.  I know of no one who wants any association with Echols and his manner of having done things.  He didn't set "tradition" but followed in the footsteps of others. We never heard of him until ... well, I won't say when only that he never influenced us; he only seemed to have messed with BLs.   His info. about "BoyChat" posters was often wrong. He placed Phil DiStasio in OH and in Canada simultaneously. He mis-identified others, too, such as "Tangie.“  Maybe his NAMBLA info. was right, but... his interest in NAMBLA was driven at a time when he was boy-battering and a fugitive.  His interest was self-interest and in saving himself or attempting to plead out on additional charges he amassed.  When people have to constantly question the source, it should indicate: There's a problem with the source.   From all indicators, Echols was up to his ears in stuff antis do not need to be seeing/saving..  He was fat white trash.

* '''Slide 27'''

Total WHOM misuses: 16!!!
WHO is nominative for use as SUBJECT; 
WHOM is accusative for use as DIRECT OBJECT.
Use WHO, if it’s the subject of your relative clause; 
Use WHOM it’s the object.
I see the cop WHO made that website.
Sacramento Sheriff’s Dept should investigate the cop WHOM I identified.
EVEN VIKINGS know WHOM is Accusative, Luvvy!

Didaskalos waves his wand:�Mind the Sparks!�
A simple incantation of:  “Dispel Anonymity” Page 290, Jenney’s First Year Latin.  
Chant it with me:
“Like all other pronouns, the relative pronoun must agree with its antecedent in gender, number, and person, while its case is determined by its use in its own clause.”

The mists clear; and now for �“someone completely different…“

And look what I found, while poking around some of the *other* anti-ped websites…
A press-release, warning about the criminal David Sprong, put out by a cop in Sacramento…
A Sacramento cop’s press release:

* '''Slide 29'''

The press release, which warns about the criminal David Sprong, is still available through several Sacramento newspapers, though differently edited in each.   Beware Spyware in Warriors for Innocence!
“Detective ***** works in the sheriff department's child abuse bureau, he said.  Sprong has been registering as a sex offender since the early 90's for crimes committed in Sacramento in the 80's but he was set to appear in court for two recent cases that just came forward.
“We fear for the safety of his girlfriend and for his daughter whom are with him right now," said Detective ***** ******, Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department.
"He is a very controlling, manipulative person and has anger-management problems," ******* said.
Wait a minute.

Cyber Bullying  BE BOLD:   Character In Action.
 A Violence Prevention Program  
Bullying - Online�Exciting new technologies provide students with direct access to family members, friends, new ideas, art, education, global connections, AND they offer an overabundance of opportunities for intimidation, bullying, harassment and abuse. �A cyberbully is “Anyone who repeatedly misuses technology to harass, intimidate, or terrorize another person.  Usually such bullying takes the form of inappropriate and hurtful e-mails, instant messages, text messages, or website posts involving threats or rumors.  Often the author is disguised as someone else (Franek 2004)”.  Disguised or not, cyberbullying can often be tracked and the bullies exposed. As in other bullying and harassment incidents, serious consequences can result for those who choose to initiate or participate in these activities.

My Email, 26 June 2007�Response to my “Wikisposure” article
Posted at www.boychat.com.  Crossposted to Perverted Justice and Iluv2surf.
Some handy facts for you guys: I'm not FROM Georgia, I'm FROM California. As for race, WELSH would be a little more precise and a little more interesting than "White," whatever that means. Why are you linking to me on a webpage under this rubric? "Here we will build pages profiling the websites and individuals promoting child-rape activism." Far from being an individual "promoting child-rape activism," I'm all about taking the bad stuff that happened to me and turning it into art. I role-model restraint for the BL community, because that's what I'd like to see more of. I talk pretty openly about my problems and feelings, because I think peds need to see how that looks. That you do find people to meet your needs, and that life does get better when you have relationships. Yeah, it hurts like hell to talk about the places where you're an inadequate man...but you learn to do it, and you learn to survive. "real identities" This is very good. It's a phrase that shows that you all and I are both on the same comic-book level. "Mild-Mannered Health Care Worker Mark Miner...whose REAL IDENTITY is....Didaskalos!" Yes. That's perfect. Could you NOT identify me as anything CORPORATE, please? I'm very proud to work independently. "It's quite impressive." Thanks for the compliment. I think the world of PJ. Pedophiles are just the beginning for you guys. I see a great future: just think of all the OTHER vices you could tempt people into committing! Like maybe you could make really fancy looking pastries and taint them with syrup of ipecac to make fat greedy people vomit when they ate them. To SAVE them from their fatness, which costs society so much. And then get it all on camera! Now that's what I call morality in action, and quality TV! "I wouldn't be loyal to the Classical tradition I revere, if I didn't put in a good word for restraint now and then. Restraint gives me access to hundreds of boys" "now and then," is what's called LITOTES, a deliberately steep understatement. Plato's vision speaks of sexual self-restraint in the strongest terms: pulling brutally on the reins of the wilder horse (=Lust) until the head is dragged down to the ground and the mouth drips blood. Surely that's savage enough to please everyone? Restraint gives EVERY teacher access to children. This is the standard social contract between teachers, parents, and administrators in America. I no touch-a da kids, I keep-a da job. This is hardly an opinion special to me. You have the following two quotes in the wrong order. Order is important when telling a story. "And at 37 years old, I am just starting to have the skill, self-confidence and physical strength to play the lifeguard well. ... When I was a boy growing up on the coast, and all my friends got to be lifeguards, I fantasized about lifeguards and got nowhere." The point of telling that story was to convince my fellow peds that they can INTERNALIZE masculinity by conquering their fears and DOING the exciting activities they see boys doing. Well, if they're not too old and fat, anyways! The point of the story is that I LEFT the FANTASIZING behind, and actually TOOK the classes, and actually BECAME a lifeguard. Now that I know what being a lifeguard is REALLY like, I'm totally bored with lifeguarding! And what good is it, really, knowing all that crazy Latin Grammar? What difference could the accusative case make in anybody's life? May I recommend that everybody google WHOM ILUV2SURF and WHOM WARRIORS FOR INNOCENCE? As is becoming traditional, I close with a few anagrams: Perverted Justice = Set Up Verdict; Jeer. Trusted Jive Creep? Reject Served It Up. Pert Jest : Rude Vice. Peds Reject Virtue. *** (best one) ---Didaskalos

Trying getting that right. I remember you quite well. You went to BC and bragged about a boy whose shoulders you massaged during a campfire. Funny thing, the principal, at the school where you were teaching (at that time) in La Jolla, CA, didn't appreciate reading your BM when cops shared your post. Recall getting fired? Now, that was funny. You never did thank anyone. Start with me: I shared your post with cops, who took it to the principal. Now, you want to remind me that you're originally from CA? You are a strange one. As long as you're in a mood to refresh people's memories: Kindly let PJ know that they cannot explain to cops how you were ID'd. They didn't make the ID; they simply stole info from others who did ID you. I wouldn't wax all arrogant if I were you. You're a fool!

To:"ILuv2Surf" <iluv2surf@inbox.com> So let me get this straight, Luvvy. I wrote on BC about something that happened between me and my senior patrol leader, when I was 14 and he was 16, in 1981....and for this you get me fired in 2000? NINETEEN YEARS LATER? By the way, are there any other of my posts that stick in your mind? Like you say, surfing is *fun!* It's been real interesting reading about the Sacramento Sheriff's department! Wikipedia maintains an interesting file on Sacramento Sheriff police brutality. And those prison guards that got canned in March for doing phone sex with inmates...Whatta laff! And how do you like that Squeaky Clean Lee Dean, who's coming in as the new Inspector-General? Gosh, I know I sure wouldn't want to have to sit in a meeting with him and ol' raisin-eyes Sheriff McGinness and explain why I make HATERSITES in my spare time, using information from Sacramento Sheriff's department computers. And I'm so impressed with your award for going around to schools and talking about "Internet Safety!" It's like we're /brothers,/ or something. You go around to schools spreading Police Culture, and I go around spreading Classical Culture. It's wonderful the way we live in a Multicultural World now, just one big open market of ideas. ***Sigh*** But EVEN VIKINGS know "WHOM" is accusative, Luvvy! ---Your pal in anagram fun, Ho Didaskalos Ho Monotatos.

To:"ILuv2Surf" <iluv2surf@inbox.com> Oh, Luvvy, it's time for us to talk. I owe you big thanks indeed. For seven long years, I thought it was the members of my "post-gay support group" in San Diego that had ratted me out in 2000...men whom I was "learning to trust" in order to overcome my "unwanted same-sex attractions." Seven years of feeling betrayed, all gone in a flash when you stepped up to the plate and took credit for my mid-year career change. THANKS, LUVVY! Three other important issues: 1) Grammar 2) Community-Building exercises 3) Your place in Internet History. 1) GRAMMAR: Consider the Summary Box in this Wiki page on relative clauses: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_relative_clauses You will notice that "WHOM" is not recognized for use as the SUBJECT of a relative clause. Jack is the boy WHO hates grammar. (Jack hates grammar; Jack is the SUBJECT, hence the NOMINATIVE case, "WHO.") Jack is the boy WHOM Kevin hit. (Kevin hits Jack; Jack is the OBJECT. Hence the ACCUSATIVE case, "WHOM.") Jack is the boy WHOM goes to school. THIS IS WRONG. In "Jack goes to school," Jack is the SUBJECT, so "WHO" should be used here. This is an error you commit over and over again, Mr. Iluv2surf. I have a dozen on file, from your extensive posting on your site and other anti sites. There is also a Sacramento cop who works on internet sex crimes and is concerned about internet safety. He is on record committing the same error in a press-release. Do you know what that means? It means that there is a *conspiracy* out there of pedo-hating, grammar-abusing cops! It could be any number guys in the conspiracy. There might be dozens. It might be two different guys. Or it might just be one guy. Whaddya think? 2) Community-Building exercises. Now, do a little THINKING here with me Luvvy. If there was a cop who worked in the black community and in his spare time this cop made HATERSITES about how black people are all just monkeys and should go back to Africa, how do you think the good people of California -- who, after all employ the cop -- would feel about that? Don't you think they would expect that the cop, if he persisted in such attitudes, ought to get a little education about what the decent people in the black community do to maintain their cultural values? PJ maintains that peds aren't worth talking to or listening to. And that hurts, because I'm a poet. You may have a chance to hear me come Fall. 3) Your place in Internet History. All I'm going to say at this point is: Dog bites man; not a story. Man bites dog; now that's a story. Oh, and you might read the current Rolling Stone. Has an article on PJ. Cheers, Didaskalos

Sacramento sheriff's deputies resign after phone-sex with inmates
Tuesday, March 13, 2007
(03-13) 11:19 PDT SACRAMENTO, (AP) -- 
Two female Sacramento County sheriff's deputies have resigned over allegations that they had phone sex with jail inmates while on duty.
The conversations were discovered when another jail employee intercepted a call and alerted supervisors, Sheriff John McGinness said. The deputies resigned Monday.
McGinness said the incidents involved at least two inmates and "graphically demonstrated a lack of professionalism and a breach of their professional responsibility" that will not be tolerated.
"Frankly, the department is better served without them as part of the team," he said.
The women, whose names are not being released, had been on paid administrative leave since early March pending an internal department investigation. McGinness said investigators believe that two inmates initiated the phone sex conversations by calling deputies who were on duty as custodial officers.
Inmates have phone privileges every day, and their conversations are monitored periodically, McGinness said.
Investigators do not believe either deputy engaged in any physical interaction of a sexual nature with inmates. Their resignations close the department's internal investigation.
Both deputies are married to other deputies at the department. One has been with the department at least 15 years and the other about eight.

Incoming Inspector-General Lee Dean
Squeaky-clean
By the book
Sheriff defends him:  “Not a good old boy.  Just Not.”
Confirmation fight.
Sacramento Bee article, 13 July
A by-the-book monitor for the sheriff's office: Panel's pick for inspector general of department goes to supervisors. 
From: Sacramento Bee (Sacramento, CA) Date: July 13, 2007  
Byline: Christina Jewett 
Jul. 13--Sacramento County's sheriff, a county supervisor and a community leader have picked a former high-ranking sheriff's official to be the department's first inspector general, an independent watchdog who will advise the sheriff. 
Lee Dean's experience here from 1974 to 1991 makes him a controversial choice to some community leaders: How can an insider shake things up? 
But it also makes him an ideal candidate, according to those who recall Dean's tenure before he went on to be police chief in Vacaville and San Bernardino.

Sacramento Bee quotes Lee Dean:

Editorial: In the end, a good choice
Dean looks right for first inspector general

The bad news first: Sacramento County used a flawed process to select the first inspector general of the Sheriff's Department. County supervisors should have made the selection independent of the sheriff. And it was a mistake to give the deputy's union veto power over the position.
Now the good news: While the process was flawed, the top candidate who emerged is impressive. Former Sacramento Deputy Lee Dean seems superbly qualified by temperament and experience for the job.
He certainly knows the landscape. Dean began his law enforcement career in 1974 as a deputy in Sacramento. He rose quickly through the ranks to chief deputy before leaving in 1991 to become a police chief, first in the city of Vacaville and then San Bernardino. Reports from rank-and-file cops and community groups in both cities are glowing.   A memo Dean wrote to rookie cops in 2001 provides a reassuring glimpse into his personal philosopy.
"If you see another employee steal something," Dean told the recruits, "report it to a supervisor immediately; you became a cop to put thieves in jail, not to condone their crimes. If you see another employee who has become emotionally agitated and potentially on the verge of using unnecessary force, pull them aside and do not let it happen; report it if it does. If your partner is driving like an absolute fool, even in a pursuit, immediately correct his or her behavior. It will be of little consolation at a hospital or funeral that you intended to later discuss the matter. If your partner is starting to exhibit inappropriate personal interest in another person (street person, individual involved in criminal behavior, Explorer Scout, etc.) stick your nose right into their business and tell him or her to clean up their act; if the inapropriate association does develop, report it."
Whether Dean's strong words will translate into effective action here remains to be seen. But his brand of straight talk is what the public wants from its sheriff and its inspector general.
