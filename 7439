Shawn Woolley
{{an hero}}

'''[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/17/48hours/main525965.shtml Shawn Woolley]''' was an ''[[EverQuest]]'' player from [[Wisconsin]] who became an hero on [[Thanksgiving]] of [[2001]] while the game was still running on his computer. Shawn had been previously [[Fucked|diagnosed]] with [[epilepsy]] and [[ADHD]]. [[Nobody gives a shit|No one gives a rat's ass about that though.]]

==EverCrack==

Before ''EverQuest'', Shawn was diagnosed with [[ADD]] and [[epilepsy]] but controlled it by [[Buttsex|medicine]]. Apparently, he seemed to do fine for someone with learning disabilities while playing every other game. That was, until he started ''EverQuest''.

His mother, Liz, noticed once he quit his [[job]]. Then, he decided he'd rather pay the monthly fee instead of pay the rent and became evicted from his apartment. While living with his mother, she noticed Shawn had seizures often when playing the game for [[Longcat|long]] periods of time. From there, Liz sent him to a voluntary group home for addictive behavior. [[Duh|Of course]], Shawn left.

Soon, he purchased a gun, which his mother did not know about until after Shawn went linkdead IRL.

[[Half-Life|After breaking his door's chain lock with a crowbar]], his mother found him dead, and the game was '''[[Lol|still running]]'''. Shawn was surrounded by pizza boxes and notes strewn everywhere pertaining to the game. Since she wasn't a basement dweller, Shawn's mother had no fucking clue what any of it meant. But she had decided "that damn game" had killed him.

==ILUVEYOU==
With the assistance of EQ players, Liz was able to gather information on what may have caused him to become [[an hero]]. On Halloween, the possibility that Shawn had an [[Online dating|e-girlfriend]] arose. On the Vallon Zek server, he created a character that [[Creepy|looked like him]] called "ILUVEYOU" (he is so much of a [[retard]] that he could not [[Grammar Nazi|spell]] "love" right) and used it for three hours, and then left the server, never to return. Even today, nobody knows why he did it. Was it shame? Was it [[For the lulz|for the lulz?]] The world may never know.

==SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING:==
Angry at ''[[EverQuest]]'''s developers, [[SOE|Sony Online Entertainment]], Liz wanted to sue. After talking with multiple psychologists and SOE's president, John Smedley, Smedley had this to say:

[[Image:Shawn_woolley_jloveb.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jloveb|You BROKE my ''EVERQUEST'']].]]
{{quote|When I spoke with Ms. Woolley, I expressed my condolences. And it's really one of those terrible things that happens. And there's just nothing to suggest that ''EverQuest'' had any role in his death. ''EverQuest'' is a game. And I don't see any connection between a form of entertainment and somebody's tragic suicide. It's entertainment. Is [[Twilight|a]] [[Mein Kampf|book]] [[Dianetics|dangerous]]? Is a [[Naruto|TV show]] [[Cody Porter|dangerous]]? I think the answer is no. People need to take responsibility and say, 'Hey, you know, this is too much. Enough's enough.' [[Duh|It's a game.]]|John Smedley; on [[logic]].}}

While Smedley has a lot of controversy surrounding him, especially with ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', this one quote pretty much earned him [[at least 100]] Internets. Even still, Shawn's mother [[Bawwwww|bawwwww'ed]] and wanted SOE to include a warning on the box saying that the game was addictive.

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Wordtoplayers.gif|thumb|left|''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'''s warning.]]
Of course, Shawn's [[Suicide|self-pwnage]] caused a big uproar in the then-smaller MMO community.  A [[Yahoo!]] group called [http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/EverQuest-Widows/ '''''EverQuest'' Widows'''] sympathized with Liz.
[[Image:On-line_gamers_anonymous.JPG|thumb|right|Liz Woolley created this [[OH WOW|site]] after her son's death.]]
In ''[[EverQuest]]'' itself, Smedley [[DO IT FAGGOT|had the developers implement a timer]] so [[Basement dweller|people]] could set their own limits. (The [[EverQuest II|sequel]] has one of these, too, but nobody uses it in either game.) Even in other MMORPGs, such as ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', a notice told players to not forget their [[IRL|friends, family, school, and work]] - one could only assume this spawned from Shawn's suicide. [[Irony|(Ironically enough, FFXI is probably the most time-consuming MMORPG out there.)]]

Liz decided she would begin a lulzy program called [http://www.olganon.org/ On-Line Gamers Anonymous] and create support groups for the [[Alcohol|recovering MMORPG addicts and their families]]. Within her site, you could find such [[Lulz|gems]] as:


{{quote|This step states the membership requirement of O.L.G.A. We use gaming to avoid our pain.
[[Delusional|We live in a fantasy world]].
We cannot cope with our real life.
Our denial kept us from seeing how powerless and unmanageable our lives had become.

We must admit that our lives are disturbed. We must accept the fact that we are helpless before the power of gaming. We must admit that we are licked as far as gaming is concerned and that we need help. We must be willing to accept the bitter fact that we cannot game like other people. And we must make, as gracefully as possible, surrender to the inevitable fact that we must stop gaming. Is it difficult for me to admit that I am different from [[What|"social" gamers]]?|Liz Woolley; on the [http://www.olganon.org/?q=node/5263 first step] to recovering from [[Drug|MMORPG addictions.]]}}

And that's just the [http://www.olganon.org/?q=node/5263 first step!] She's going to mention a [[God|higher power]], isn't she?

{{quote|Anyway, I knew that I needed a power greater than myself to overcome this self-defeating behavior of continuing to talk to someone who was abusive and also continuing to invest large chunks of time in game, which I could not afford.  I had tried to some degree to sever ties with the person, only to end up talking again, and the same attempts failed with regard to the game.  However, from previous 12 step experience, I knew that my Higher Power would help me overcome both problems.  I knew deep within that of myself I didn't have what it [[Sic|competely]] took to overcome my problems but with faith and reliance on my faith I could.

a) In your journal, write down what makes you believe that your Higher Power can take away your gaming issue.
b) Than, write down any reservations that you have, regarding your Higher Power's ability to take away these issues.
c) Think about who your [[God|Higher Power]] is. Write down the [[RPG|attributes and characteristics]] of your Higher Power.|[[Penn and Teller|FUCK!!!]]}}


The users of the site provide some excellent lulz fodder, too:

{{quote|I had a bad problem of powerlessness.

Way back when, after the release of [[Africa|Kunark]], I finally got my chance to start taking too the planes for the famed planar armor. ( Back then it was sort of the high class armor for those who were at the top, but not the uberl33t ) I would try to do a pickup raid every now and again, thinking i would get lucky, but I quickly learned that in order to even have a chance to get armor with the seniority rating, I would have to go.. a lot.

Now for the Valorium Armor which was the paladins plane armor, existed on things called fetid fiends, and were a normal melee mob in the plane of fear. There were a total of [[At least 100|13]] of them in a full spawn, and there were [[Penis|male]] and [[Vagina|female]] kinds. The ratio of male to female was completely random, and only the male drops the armor. And on the male, the armor is a rare drop. So on a good night, two to three pieces may drop, and on a normal night, one or no pieces [[Sic|droped]].

See the pattern here? Verant's devilish schemes in the work.|AremUlosia; on how [[SOE|Verant]] is [[Satan|devilish]].}}

The entire site is good for laughs, whether you play ''[[EverQuest]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', or no MMORPG at all!
