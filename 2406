Facts about the werejohncandy.

{{frame|
All werejohncandies are immortal and very loyal, they are also invulnerable. 

The only bad guy werejohncandy I know is Chumsley's evil counterpart Boris.<br> 
They are nocturnal, meaning they come out at night. 

A werejohncandy can eat all the food it wants without getting sick. 

Werejohncandies love to be hugged and have their big, warm, furry stomach rubbed. 

A Werejohncandy's hands are not paw-like, they are modeled on John Candy's own hands. 

Unlike most werecreatures who prefer to bite their victims to turn them into one of their kind, all it takes for a werejohncandy to turn someone into one of their kind is to hug them. 

A Werejohncandy is 300lbs of fat, fur and cuteness. The fat and fur not only keep him cool in summer and warm in winter but also make excellent protective coating. Also combined with the elements of Awesome and Cuteness - it makes the werejohncandy well protected from enemies. 

Werejohncandies don't suffer the same health risks as overweight humans. 

As a werejohncandy I look a lot like Chumsley except I have a slightly darker mane, and a torn t shirt with a picture of Michael Jackson on it and the words This Is It at the bottom along with a pair of dark blue jeans.}}
