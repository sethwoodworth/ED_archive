Politics and the city
[http://www.politicsandthecity.com/ Politics and the City] is a [[website]] invented by June Sarpong. It is a complete waste of everybody's time.


== Origins ==


June Sarpong is a retarded <s>token black</s> TV presenter from [[Britain]]. Some people believed she actually was good at her job, but this was only because she was usually standing next to [[Douchebag|Vernon Kay]]. [[Image:June_getty.jpg|thumb]]

One day, after a particular energetic session shagging [[Lemonparty|Culture Minister David Lammy MP]], June hit on the idea that one could create a news source that not only had news about [[politics]], but also contained lots of [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|mindless guff]] about [[celebrities]]. Some might consider that a news source that covered both politics news and celebrity news might exist in such forms as e.g. a newspaper. However, June insists that there is a problem with newspapers.

''"[[Bullshit|So many of my girlfriends, who are smart, successful women, don't have a clue about politics - and it's not because they don't want to,]]" she says.

"Often they don't feel confident speaking up because they don't feel knowledgeable enough. '''Newspapers assume an awful lot of knowledge.'''"''
- June Sarpong, speaking on [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7496961.stm BBC News].

"Smart, successful women", those who are intellectually defeated by a newspaper. In fact, if were honest, we might suggest that June's friends are a bunch of [[Retard|illiterate whores]].

== Content ==

Politics and the City [http://junesblog.politicsandthecity.com/2008/07/07/were-up-and-running/#more-6 promises] plenty of guest blogs by [[Australia|Dannii Minogue]], [[Bitch|Kathy Lette]], [[Dyke|Anna Friel]] and lots of other people who [[Noone|noone]] gives a fuck about.


The guest blogs began with a post by allegedly-intelligent [[Trap|supermodel]] [[Ginger|Lily Cole]]. Sadly, due to the overwhelmingly positive and rapturous response from the [[Btards|internet readership]], her post has now been mysteriously taken down. However, a snippet has been saved for your enlightenment. The following paragraph describes Lily's thrilling experience of attending a gig in New York by [[Morrissey|some shit indie band you've never heard of]].

''Fire - fireworks - fire. A fireman steps on stage and for a momentary second the cheese factor reminds me of the Madonna gig and I think why oh why Jamie did you get firemen involved?! Except there is a fire, (ie FIRE), and the gig is interrupted as the uniformed man (note lovingly) takes the mike; the pair on guitars left Dazed and Confused. God love surrealism and the miracles in the mistakes.''

Lily Cole is due to be attending Cambridge University soon. Clear evidence of more dumbing-down of university education.

Politics and the City also contains [http://mrbigsblog.politicsandthecity.com/ Mr Big's Blog], in which Claire Staples relates her [[Bestiality|ongoing relationship]] with her [[dog]]. Presumably this is due to her inability to form relationships with actual humans.
