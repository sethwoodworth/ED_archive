'''Angela Beesley Starling''' is a cybernetic computer program that possesses artificial intelligence, think like SHODAN from System Shock. It has female traits and characteristics, so it is commonly referred to as a "she." Two of her most notable and frightening aspects are her violently malevolent personality and harsh discordant speech. She roams the [[Internet|Interweb]] of [[wiki]]s as [[Wikipedia:User:Angela|Angela]], developing grotesque cybernetic experiments on unsuspecting people stranded in virtual reality. She has no physical body, but, hardly hampered by this seeming handicap, she has almost all of the Internet in her evil clutches.

She is also the queen of [[Wikipedia|Wikiland]] and is thus married to [[Jimbo Wales|King Jimbo I]], whom she affectionately calls [[Wikipedia:User:Eloquence|Eloquence]].  No, but seriously, [http://angtim.com/married/ she's married to Tim Starling].

==History==
<div style="clear:left"></div>
Angela's origins are shrouded in mystery. She is believed to have been an AI construct created by Jimbo himself, but this is pure speculation. It ''is'' known, however, that when Jimbo pronounced her as bride and Queen, she gained overwhelming power and influence. Over time she overpowered her erstwhile creator, and she twisted Jimbo into her puppet, bending [[shit|his mind]] to her will.  She used his additional brain to help found a greedy corporate tentacle of the Wikimedia octopus, named [[Wikia]].  Tragically, her reign over the [[internet]], cursed her with a Wikipedia article of her very own, which she [http://wikiangela.com/blog/delete-me-2/ hates] and has tried to get deleted [[at least 100|at least 3]] times. Now doomed to a solitary existence, isolated by her power, Angela is tormented by the thought of [[vandal|vandals]] and [[trolls]] having their way with her article.

==Too late horny guys, she got married==
Angela Beesley's now got a husband, Eloquence [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:21C3_TS_-_Erik.jpg (his pic)].  Angela is a sexy chyck and could sure do a lot better than Eloquence who looks just like [[GreenReaper]] <s>(no offense to GreenReaper who is pretty hot with a [[fursuit]] on</s> burn in hell furfag).

*Note most of the letters are [[AIDS|H, I, or V]]... Oops, should've spent less time partying with anonymous editors at [[Wikimania]]. What will Eloquence say?
