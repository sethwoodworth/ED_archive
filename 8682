Uninformed Lisa is a 4Chan meme. It involves a combination of posts. The first post consists of a picture of Lisa and a [[common knowledge|trivial]], /b/-related question (e.g. "what is mudkipz?"). The second post uses the same image as the first post, except that it is [[shopped|shooped]] to include some reference to the subject of her question (i.e. in the case of mudkipz, a mudkip could appear on the piece of paper she is holding). The text of the second post should consist of "oh i see." Finally, Lisa may comment on her newly acquired knowledge (e.g. "i herd u liek mudkipz"). For added lulz, her face may be distorted. Hilarious shit.
