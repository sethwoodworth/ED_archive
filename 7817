'''Steve 'Rim' Jobs''' ('''Steve Jew''') is the world's second [[Al Gore|greatest douchebag]], the bearer of the [[Reality Distortion Field]], he is the anti-christ, the man who broke [[Woz]]'s heart, and the man whose company (Apple) has had to be paid by [[Microsoft]] to stay in business.  He is also the great [[Jesus|messiah]] of [[Apple]] and the mysterious power behind [[homosexuals]].  Steve Jobs is the world's most lovable asshole.  His real name was '''Berkley Blue''' until 1976, when his co-workers renamed him "Jobs" due to him being handy or something, in more ways than one...

On September 14th, 2010, it was revealed that Mr. Jobs is [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-14/steve-jobs-stopped-at-japan-airport-over-ninja-stars-spa-says.html?cmpid=yhoo in fact a ninja as well.]

==Beginnings==
[[Image:Steve Jobs.jpg|thumb|right|Ah, the good ol' days.]]
[[Image:JobsCoolface.jpg|thumb|"Problem, [[Microsoft]]?"]]
Steve Jobs got his start at [[Atari]].  Through this gig, Jobs helped [[Nolan Bushnell]] (a widely known [[Faggot]]), propagate [[furry]]ism -- and get [[Woz]] to do all the work for him.  When he wasn't working, he was making [[Bell]] very angry by selling [[blue box]]es to the masses.  Eventually, he discovered that Woz was building a computer and so, catching a whiff of the scent of money, he convinced Woz to quit his job at Hewlett Packard in order to start Apple.

==First Tenure at Apple==
Steve Jobs's time at Apple was spent hiring Pepsi salesmen, making fun of his underlings' virginity, and ranting against [[IBM]].  Jealous of the fact that [[Woz]] got to do all the cool shit, Steve worked on the Apple /// and the Lisa (named after his estranged daughter) -- both of which flopped lower than [[Lady GaGa|Steve G's]] [[penis|manhood]].  Wandering around for more stuff to do, he discovered that Jef Raskin was working on the Macintosh.  Knowing that glory was to be had, he sent out spies to intrude into the heart of Xerox.  This was how the [[GUI]] was born.

It was here at Apple that Jobs revealed the [[Reality Distortion Field]] -- convincing everyone who worked on the Mac that they were "artistes" and therefore [[1337]].  [[IRL]], this would be known as being a "cult leader".  Unfortunately, the Reality Distortion Field obfuscates the time-space continuum.

In 1985, the [[Macintosh]] was introduced, which to this day still rapes people with the "This program has unexpectedly quit for no fucking reason. All information was lost. Haha." message.  It was overpriced, had no color, had no hard drive, and its only appeal was that it made everyone want to join an [[1984|Orwellian totalitarian regime]]. No one bought it.  Jobs therefore blamed the Pepsi salesmen for not doing their jobs.  Subsequently, Jobs was kicked out of Apple.

==The Truth Behind Jobs' Firing==
While Scully the Pepsi Pusher was behind Jobs getting ousted from the company he helped found, he actually brought it all on himself. When the Macintosh was in development, it was designed with a color screen in mind, However, the only company in the world that made color monitors with the [[lulz|resolution]] *and* small size that the Mac required was a Jap company that didn't want to sell cheap to the [[Americans|gaijin]]. The company sensei agreed to speak directly with Jobs to work out a deal, but Jobs showed up coked to the gills and was tossed out the door by a bunch of corporate ninjas. When he came back empty-handed, Apple was forced to release the Mac without color, and then told Mac users that "real computer users don't need color screens!" This was viewed as an excuse only a color blind junkie could have come up with, which is what Jobs happened to be. Scully took the rumors, found the proof, and then handed it to the Apple Board of Dipshits a ton of paper trails showing how Jobs had embezzled millions to fund his coke and LSD habits, as well as removing all the colors from the break rooms and cubes so his serfs couldn't see what he couldn't see.

==NeXT==

Trying to prove that Apple's success was no fluke, Steve Jobs therefore founded NeXT.  NeXT's claim to fame was a toaster that cost $10 million and a program that made [[*nix]] look pretty.  No matter that NeXT was not profitable. Every [[geek]] who means anything owned a NeXT box at one time or another -- even though only one person ever bought one.

Historians would later call this Jobs's [[cutting|blue period]].

==Pixar==

In 1986, Steve Jobs heard that his good buddy [[George Lucas]] was going through a divorce. Reaching into his wallet and giving him a crisp $10 million bill (the very one that was given him by the sole owner of the NeXT toaster), he bought [[George Lucas|Lucasfilm]]'s animation division. Renaming the company [[Pixar]], Jobs promptly forgot he ever owned it. For this reason, he became an billionaire when Pixar went public.

==Second Tenure at Apple==
[[Image:Stainedglassjobs445340.jpg|thumb|right|Stevus [[Christ]] delivering Power Macs to his followers, all of which didn't work. A few minutes later he was nailed to a [[Windows]] logo.]]
Again using the Reality Distortion Field, Steve Jobs convinced Gil Amelio to buy out NeXT.  Then, after hiring hitmen to kill Jean-Louis Gassee (founder of the BeOS), he forced Gil Amelio's resignation from Apple by placing a bloodied [[dogcow]]'s head in Mr. Amelio's bed while he was sleeping.  This is how he became CEO of Apple.

It was then discovered that Jobs was actually [[Jesus Christ]] when he started selling jellybean computers, creating [[Mac OS X]] with his bare hands, and releasing the [[iPod]] to the world.  He is also [[Jedi|Luke Skywalker]] even though he embraced the dark side when he allowed [[Microsoft]] to buy $150 million worth of Apple stock. During this time, Jobs also discovered [[U2]] and [[Ellen Feiss]].

In June 2005, Steve Jobs provoked millions of Macintosh fanboys to slit their wrists when they discovered that Apple was having hot gay sex with [[Intel]] (''see '''''[[OSx86]]''').

==Steve Jobs has AIDS==
[[Image:SteveJobsAIDSTest.jpg|thumb|right|ZOMG, i has AIDS]]
[[Image:Apple aids.jpg|thumb|i can haz aids?]]
After years of hard [[anal sex]] with his fellow [[mac]] [[faggots]], Steve Jobs got the [[AIDS]], but no one cares because it's not cool as cancer. Apparently his [[gay|turtleneck sweaters]] were used for [[David Carradine|auto-erotic asphyxiation]] with various homosexual partners (including [[obese]] [[bitch|fuck buddy]], [[Woz|Steve Wozniak]].) Soon he will trade his [[macbook air]] and [[iphone]] for Broth Soup, A Robe to clothe his frail body and [[buy a dog|a dog]]. Of course he won't be able to feed that dog since he is going to be too busy dying and getting his AZTs. Already he's losing a shitload of weight. Pretty soon his t-cell count will be lower than Crapple's stock!

[http://valleywag.com/5015211/the-incredible-shrinking-apple-ceo ValleyFag shows him slowly dying due to AIDS] - Unfortunately the pool wasn't closed.

Recently Steve had to pull out of [[Faggotry|MacWorld]]. He later said he would leave the company for 6 months due to a "[[lie|hormone problem]]". Steve is probably at a [[anal|bath house]] in San Fran right now getting [[rape|treatment]].

== Liver's Closed Due to AIDS ==
In 2009 it was found that Steve-O's liver was shot. No one knows the [[Hookers and blow | precise reason why]]. Waiting lists in the US for liver transplants are horrendously long, upwards of five years, but sure enough within months old Steve had a new liver and was off wrecking it in no time. The doctor at the transplant clinic that treated him was quoted as saying [[Lie | ''"We provide transplants to patients regardless of race, sex, age, financial status, or place of residence."'']] but [[some argue]] that it's more likely they stripped the organs from a Thai hooker when Steve flashed his gold card.

== Things Steve Jobs has invented ==
Perhaps most important of all things Steve Jobs has done is the hundreds of things he has invented to advance mankind '''with his bare hands'''. These include, but are not limited to:
*Computers

*Touchscreens
