Invader Zim
[[Image:ZIM OVERLOAD by Nny Humper.jpg|thumb|400px|You're not a true Zim fan until you've spent at least $1250 on merchandise.]]
'''''Invader Zim''''' is a show about an Jew and the constant attempts by his [[aspie]] [[emo]] fuck-buddy from Earth to stop him. Given that it was created by overlord Jhonen Vasquez, its [[fail]] levels were predictably [[over 9000]]. [[Hot Topic]], sensing its [[oh exploitable|exploitability]] in the pre-teen [[faggot]] market, promptly arrived to [[rape]] it with tee-shirts of the character GIR with quotes [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|not even from the show]]. [[Hot Topic]] has beaten this trend to death and still continues to [[necrophilia|beat its rotting corpse.]] [[Down Syndrome|Fans]] of the show have gotten so sick of the [[trying too hard|over-merchandising]] that they have quit liking the show (however, these fans are all faggy [[13 year old boy|teen]][[16 year old girl|agers]], so they moved on to [[Mary Sue|Twilight]] and [[retarded|Charlie the Unicorn]] and proceeded to shell out money to Hot Topic [[hypocrite|again]]). If [[you]] should ever encounter anyone over the age of 20 wearing an Invader Zim T-shirt in public, you are [[fact|legally allowed]] to beat the piss out of them.

== The Characters ==


[[image:Richardhorvitz.gif|thumb|Voice of Zim. Voice of Zim. [[truth|He does not alter his voice at all]]]]

The cast consists of a  bunch of spastic cartoons shouting at each other nonstop. this is only funny if something funny is happening. Shouting, by itself, is [[unfunny]]


'''Dib:''' A [[drama queen]] outcast with a [[cock|massive head]]


'''Zim:''' a [[midget|short]] [[xenu|alien]] prick


'''GIR:''' Zim's [[retarded]] robot sidekick. The only reason this show was popular was because of his [[win]]


'''Gaz:''' Dib's crazy [[bitch]] sister (notably the only one who realizes that Zim couldn't conquer his own [[dick]])

== Plot Summary ==
The show sets around an alien named Zim (he's from the planet [[Mexico|Irk]], therefore Irken), which rules a mighty empire, which, copying the [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|United States]], invades other planets, kills and enslaves the native inhabitants, and then turns the planet into something half-useful. Zim, who was banished after he [[This is why we can't have nice things|fucked up]] the previous galactic conquest effort his incredible Jew set out to complete. Then, he was banished, but he hears about a new series of conquests, so he ''quits his banishment'' (WTF?), and begs his leaders, The Almighty Tallest, to give him a second chance. He shows up on the Irken Empire's convention planet just as the Tallest are selecting a series of special ops troops. These highly trained soldiers, along with advanced robots, are to infiltrate the enemy planets and get to know the natives and their weaknesses before sending for reinforcements and wiping them out, just like Colombus did. Zim begs for redemtion, so The Tallest pretend to care and [[I did it for the lulz|send him on a mission to his death]] with a defective robot named GIR, who was made from Irken garbage. Basically, he is supposed to find some "mystery planet", whose location is a mystery. Despite six months of extreme annoyance by his fucking childish robot, Zim manages to not die, and find Earth. He contacts the Almighty Tallest and the two gay lovers are completely surprised to find he actually lived. 

Meanwhile, a spastic [[emo]] [[Asperger's|aspie]] named Dib hears the broadcast from Zim's planet and promptly freaks the fuck out. His family, used to his stupidity, ignores him, just like everyone else does through the rest of the series. Then, Zim arrives in a giant spaceship and uses his alien technology to make a house grow out of the ground and even extend its tentacles into other houses, and chooses very poor and practically useless disguises for himself and his robot, all while waking up the neighborhood. Dib instantly recognizes Zim as an alien, but nobody believes him, and they all make fun of him. Even though he has the technology to [[Columbine|kill fucking everyone]], Dib still [[Buttsex|takes the abuse]] from his classmates. Each episode in a nutshell is pretty much a scenario in which [[Idiots|the hero and the villain are too incompetent to thwart each other in saving/taking over the world]], constantly [[divide by zero|canceling each other out]] with their retarded antics causing nothing productive to ever happen. Unfortunately, Zim never realizes he is a loser and fails to become [[an hero]], which would have been a hilarious plot point. 

''Invader Zim'' ran for just over one season, but managed successfully creating a detestable fanbase, loads of merchandise, fan sites, rabid hellfans, a cult following, and general [[rape|mass destruction]] in its wake. [[Faggotry|Violence]] in school escalated as kids argued over which episode was the best, which character was the best, and anyone who said the show sucked was immediately slaughtered with a plastic fork from the school cafeteria. Parents who failed to let their kids have the TV when the show was on faced a dilemma not unlike feeding a gremlin after midnight. It was like crack to the fans, and if they didn't get their Zim Fix, [[divide by zero|bad shit would happen]].

== Fanbase ==

Of course, Emofags and Goths worldwide swarmed like [[cock|dicks]] to Paris Hilton over this show, storming Hot Topic for the slew of merchandise that followed the release of ''Invader Zim'' so they could continue to be [[stupid|unique and original]]. About 80% of ''Invader Zim'' fans are whining, eyeliner addicted teenagers. It was a hideous new breed of human, if you'd even want to classify them as human: The Zimfags. Ten times more deadly than [[Furries|Furfags]] and holding onto one of the worst [[Rule_34|Rule 34]] image reservoirs in all of history, Zimfags went around (and still are) scarring minds one [[DeviantArt]] submission at a time. 

But the "art" was nothing, my friends; nothing compared to the terror of the fanfics. Riddled with grammar bad enough to give [[Sandygurl]] a run for her retarded money and full of stupid plots, bad fan characters, and flamingly bad sex scenes, Zimfags all around would read with sweaty palms and drooling mouths as they fap-fap-fapped to something that would fit very nicely into [[The_Pain_Series|The Pain Series]]. The small percent of Zimfics not surrounding perverted sexcapades are a lot like rap music: once you've read one, you've read them all.

‘All this pain and suffering makes Zim horny,’ answered the Invader with a smirk.

‘But we just…’

A painful twitch of his nipple transformed anything he had to say in a needy whimper. Soon, Zim was kissing him hungrily, claws roaming under his shirt. Dib’s hands traveled down, past the red sleeveless shirt, playing with the button of the black pants. He fumbled a bit with it, grumbling against Zim’s lips, eager to get their clothing –once again– out of the way.

=== The Canceling of Zim === 

Zimfags worldwide blew their brains out when they heard the news that ''Zim'' [[win|was being canceled]]; [[butthurt]] was had, petitions were signed, forums were created, websites were formed, and nothing ever [[I_came|came]] of it other than a lot of irritating bullshit.

== Butthurt Towards Nickelodeon == 
[[File:Sucksuck.jpg|thumb|right|an 'artist' shows their mary-sue OCs!]]
Of course, since any idiot with a computer can use [http://www.petitiononline.com Petition Online], there was a petition made to try and bring ''Zim'' back on the air. Nickelodeon laughed and ignored the retards, and they were left staring at the [http://www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/signed.cgi?izlovers&114201 idiotic comments] left by petition signers, ranting and raving about how it was the best show ever to hit Nick, obviously ignoring the classics like ''Ren & Stimpy'', ''Rocko's Modern Life'', ''Angry Beavers'' and [[loli|''Zoey 101'']].

{{morphquote|mqtest|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;

=== Jhonen's Take on the Cancelling ===

{{quote|Zim was cancelled in, what? 2002? I mean, babies have been born... have learned how to walk; have begun gathering the necessary essentials to succeed in life, so it's... it's forever ago for me!}}

=== The Aftermath ===

After a year or so of whining, suicide, and depression, one of the rabid fans of ''Invader Zim'' eventually slept with Nickelodeon (and probably Jhonen too) hardcore in return for a DVD release. What Nickelodeon did was laugh at them, made them their bitch, and then sold the rights for ''Zim'' to Anime Works. Three volumes were released, packed with bonus features, unaired episodes, and though it was rumored to be, the producers must have pussied out because the unedited version of The Worst X-Mas Ever was nowhere to be found. Among the unaired episodes was "The Girl Who Cried Gnome", which is actually a documentary on the all-too common species ''[[attention_whore|Attentoinus whorebagus]]''. In the episode, a little [[Loli|girl]] gets her foot stuck in a [[Goatse|hole]], and even though she can get out safe and fine, she freaks out; rescue teams and news vans ensue. 

[[shit_nobody_cares_about|DVD Bonus material includes subtitles in the Irken Language, the original pilot, interviews with the cast, and commentary]], which surely gave a collective orgasm to every Zimfag on the planet. 

{{quote|ZOMG THE DVD HAS COMMENTARY I CAN HEAR JHONEN TALKING HE'S SO HOT OMGOMGOMG!!!!|Typical response from a Zimfag}}

===Operation Head Pigeons===

The latest plan of failure to bring back Invader Zim. Apparently a group of Zimfags took a blog entry written by TEH ALMIGHTEH JHONEN OF DUUM!111! saying that he'd like to work on Invader Zim again but Nickelodeon refused to let him waaaaaay too seriously. So over 9,000 Zimfags decided to get together on DevianTART and Facebook to try to bring the show, which has been dead for nearly 10 FUCKING YEARS, back.How? BY SPAMMING THE FUCK OUT OF NICKELODEON, OF COURSE. As if they give a fuck. 

=== Trolling Potential ===

Zimfags are so easily riled up, it should be considered a crime against man not to fuck with these people. [[DeviantArt]] is riddled with Zim fanclubs, Zimfags, and ZADR lovers; take your pick and post the lulz.

On another note a great way to find zimfags is through the clubs that abound and one of the most fun ways are the ones with fetishes like the lesbian xenophile [http://irken-femme-love.deviantart.com/ irken-femme-love] or the gay xenophiles of the [http://z-a-d-r.deviantart.com/ zadr] club.
