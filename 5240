[[Hack]] writer of [[Linux]] BusinessGram, and exemplar of plastic surgery gone wrong, '''Maureen O'Gara''' touched off one of the most paranoia-inducing sagas of the SCO/IBM case when she went on a stalking rampage in an attempt to uncover the identity of Pamela Jones, webmaster of [http://www.groklaw.com Groklaw]. In doing so, she went beyond the call of duty, publishing her phone number, email address, and pictures of her home, in a stunning imitation of a [[/b/]]tard.  While she was at it, she harrassed Pamela Jones' elderly mother, commented on the ugly interior decor of her home and revealed -- to the horror of all -- that Pamela Jones is indeed a [[Cult|Jehovah's Witness]].

This raised protests at LinuxWorld magazine, and culminated in the mass resignations of the senior editors.  Sys-Con, publisher of LinuxWorld, has refused to apologize.  This, in turn, has caused [[DDOS]] attacks on its site, advertisers withdrawing their money, and mass cancellations of LinuxWorld subscriptions. And also hilarity, which the [[linux]] world is sadly lacking.
