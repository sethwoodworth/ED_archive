[[Image:Ernest_Peters.png|thumb|"[[OP]] here. [[911|Bwaaaaahhhhh!"]]]]
[[Image:Ernest_peters.png|thumb|The [[troll|table]] is set.]]
'''Ernest Peters''' is a [[lazy]], [[faggot|viola playing]] 18-year-old student at Chantilly High School in Fairfax, [[Virginia]] who is about to flunk '''English 12''' and be [[b&|expelled]] from [[school]]. This in itself isn't very surprising considering the area is full of spoiled elitist rich brats who are dumb as fuck. Seriously, It's like Myspace IRL in that area.

The story of '''Ernest Peters''' begins on [[B|/b/]] on Tuesday, October 30th, 2007, when [[OP|'''Ernest''']] posted a screenshot of an email exchange he'd supposedly had with his [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER!|English]] teacher regarding his homework assignment. Because his teacher had refused to accept his homework via email, he planned to have [[Anonymous]] spam the fuck out of her school email address.

However, being a [[newfag]] of epic proportion, Ernest forgot -or [[retard|was ignorant]] of- the [[Rules of the Internet|cardinal rule]] of all [[chan]] boards: that [[X is not your personal army|'''"Anonymous is not your personal army!"''']]. 


After a few initial posts reminding Ernest that /b/ was not his personal army, a [[oxymoron|backraid]] was called for where /b/ formed a personal army to launch an all-out [[raid|attack]] on the unfortunately named Ernest.

==The Backraid==
[[Image:Raid flow.jpg|thumb|So, what's the plan Ray?]]
[[Image:One of your students.jpg|thumb|'''"Dear [[MILF|Ms. Harris]]'''..." the appetisers are served]]
[[Image:Regarding_ernest.png|thumb|...followed by some hearty [[soup]].]]
[[Image:Bomb threat.jpg|thumb|...followed by a [[jake Brahm|bomb threat!]]]]
{{tinyquote|I don't have a printer, she said I should go to the library and print it out...
anyway, /b/ has lived up to its unpredictability and I am getting punished hardcore now :)
So I'll still post up my suspension/expulsion whenever I get it just for the sake of laughs.|Ernest}}
{{tinyquote|I don't know what I'm going to do...for starters I need a dog.|[[User Talk:Ernasty10050|Ernest]]}}


The initial salvoes in the [[buttsecks|backraid]] were in the form of [[Anonymous]] [[email|missives]] to the English teacher in question -one Ms Michelle Harris- snitching on Ernie's attempted [[troll|shenanigans]] on [[4chan]]. The first, primitive rounds were in the form of [[B|/b/tards]] sending Ms. Harris [[OP]]'s post to expose his whiny faggotry. These were later followed up by full-blown endorsements for [[banhammer|disciplinary action]] to be taken for said faggotry.

The trouble with '''backraids''' however, is that one never knows if [[OP]] is actually a [[troll|third party]] who's [[divide by zero|dividing the backraid by zero]] and is instigating an attack on an innocent. In this case, /b/ jumped on the backraid bandwagon before thinking things through.


As the [[post]] continued and the backraid unfolded, [[oldfag|someone]] logically pointed out that maybe the [[OP]] wasn't Ernest but another [[13-year-old|student]] who had successfully enlisted /b/ to be ''''his'''' personal army to troll '''Ms. Harris''' in order to [[pwn]] Ernest.

Ernest jumped on this [[chink]] in /b/'s armour and attempted to spin it thusly, however, thanks to the  awesome powers of [[social networking]], he was busted and his [[IP]] was found.

==[[ED IRC]]==

After some [[1337]] [[Talk:Ernest Peters|sleuthing]], an [[OldDirtyBtard|ED Sysop]] realised that Ernest was -in fact- an ED user and invited him to [[get on IRC fgt]] to thank him for playing [[the game]] and donating such [[EPIC LULZ]] for the [[ED|cause]].

Ernest has promised to return to '''#ed''' and end our tale with a [[The End|final act]] -if he survives the the brutal [[goatse|assræp]] he's sure to be on the receiving end of when he's done with the school principal tomorrow.

==The aftermath==

ERNESTO! (mofuggin ernest)
10:29
I showed up and they put handcuffs on me almost immediately

Patrick Bateman
10:29
lol
you lie like a rug

ERNESTO! (mofuggin ernest)
10:29
claiming that their IT guys had figured out it was my IP address that posted everything
obviously untrue
proceeded to threaten me with legal crap
then read the ED page on me
and realized I got "hacked"
and I was given a one-day suspension....
until they broughtin mrs harris
and she fuckin flipped
she was in tears
"there were pictures of penises and maggots"

Patrick Bateman
10:30
is she a /b/tard now?

ERNESTO! (mofuggin ernest)

ERNESTO! (mofuggin ernest)
10:41
I don't know hwo to prove it, for some reason they sent me home without anything at about 9:30
I assume there will be some form of paperwork

Patrick Bateman
10:41
they have to supply dox

ERNESTO! (mofuggin ernest)
10:41
that's what I thought
they asked me what "anonymous is not your personal army" meant

Patrick Bateman
10:41

ERNESTO! (mofuggin ernest)
11:00

Patrick Bateman
11:00

"did we just become 'maxs' personal army?"

Patrick Bateman
11:04

ERNESTO! (mofuggin ernest)
11:04

ERNESTO! (mofuggin ernest)
11:08

to see if I'm retarded...
because when they asked why I did it, I said for the laughs
which "is not a normal response"

Patrick Bateman
11:09

lol
ALL HAIL /b/

ERNESTO! (mofuggin ernest)
11:09

Patrick Bateman
11:09
