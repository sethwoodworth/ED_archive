= Preface: [[ Unwarranted self-importance]]=
<div style="font-size:.85em;">
A theory introduced to civilization by [[Socrates]], unwarranted self-importance is the feeling that you are actually worth something despite not having made any contributions to anything at all, thus making yourself look like a complete [[twat]]. This is common amongst LiveJournal users, [[chav]]s and others prone to arrogance, from which this state of mind commonly draws most of its qualities. It even occurs on [[ED]] all the time.

Unwarranted self-importance is also often associated with [[flamer]]s or [[n00b]]s. It may be found on sites where posts or edits are encouraged, as many will imagine themselves working for some greater power as they upset others. It also comes into play when the unwarranted self-important are [[penis envy|lacking]] in one or more areas of their lives -for example, [[I Don't Watch TV|being too poor to afford a TV.]]

{{Spoiler|RachelBrown, Poetlister, Taxwoman, Brownlee, Newport, Londoneye, and Runcorn are [[sockpuppet|ALL THE SAME PERSON!]]  Why else do they always use the same proxies?!?!?!?}}


On a hot summer's day in 2005, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Kingstonjr five of the biggest] [[attention whores]] on Wikipedia randomly edited Wikipedia within a few days of each other. Unholy fuck, let's put up a [[penis|monument]]! Since they were all avatars of the same [[IRL]] person and they [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Newport&diff=prev&oldid=133807256#Vote_and_Consensus_Frauds campaigned heavily on particular topics], this led to some minor [[drama]] on [[TOW|ToW]].

== The not-much-at-all five ==

Rachel Brown pushed herself as cute on Wikipedia and her imaginary friend, who chose to be called [[Poetlister]], decided to join in. Offering a photo that showed cheeks like a well-fed [[hamster]] and bleached blonde hair, she appealed to [[geek]]s the world over.

[[Image:Taxwoman's friend.JPG|thumb|right|Don't you dare cross Taxwoman.]]
[[Image:Aniface.gif|frame|right|Cross her and get this.]]


Next came [[Taxwoman]], the imaginary [[IRL]] bureaucrat who created an enormous following with her salacious writing on [[BDSM]] articles.

[[Londoneye]] is, like Taxwoman, an imaginary person from London.  

[[Newport]] didn't put pictures of herself on the Internet but is also [[OMFG|imaginary]].

Wikipedian males and [[lesbian]]s who knew of the pictures masturbated over them at their Wikipedia fests, as they were better than the usual gang of transvestites like [[Ambi]] and [[Kelly Martin]], not to mention [[Angela Beesley|glamour-photography queens]].

== The [[Attention whores]] vs. the [[Cabal]] ==

RachelBrown decided to put some shit into Wikipedia's controlled article "List of Jewish Jurists."  [[Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters]] opposed this as a fellow Jew of the freedom-hating variety. He called for assistance from [[SlimVirgin]].  She began by insisting that it was wrong to add too many Jews since she was so concerned about all Jews constantly being persecuted by non-existent nazis.  

Then RachelBrown called on help from the [[Attention whores]]. [[Poetlister]] attempted to come to the rescue. The kind of lovestruck Wikinerds who put up a lame effort for [[publicgirluk]], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Antidote#User:IZAK exemplified by a bunch of morons whose usernames you might see here] all ganged up on SlimVirgin, so [[Poetlister]] came along to the rescue.  They and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Antidote#User:IZAK others] tried to gang up on [[SlimVirgin|Slimey]].

RachelBrown made even Lulu accept her ''bona fides'', so SlimVirgin, having the right to make current policy and so knowing it much better than poor Lulu, changed the rules on references.  SlimVirgin, with the uncanny ability to edit [[Wikipedia]] for 397 consecutive hours, thus made sure that RachelBrown lost. 

SlimVirgin had help from one of her [[Israeli]] buddies, Antidote, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=Antidote at the time undercover as a Croatian nazi type]. For his own nefarious reasons, he or she decided it was best to list fewer Jews.  Yet this wasn't enough for SlimVirgin.  So she wept to known [[faggot]] [[Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters]], who rushed to her rescue, and took on the beautiful people, bitchily attacking them for their lack of fashion sense.

Antidote also helped out [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Antidote by creating a massive sock puppet army], and SlimVirgin promised not to ban him, just so long as he kept on attacking people she hated.

The attacks led to [[RachelBrown]] and [[Poetlister|Poetaster]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_mediation&diff=32278670&oldid=32276641#List_of_Jewish_jurists calling for a clusterfuck between themselves, SlimVirgin and Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters]. Their impartial clusterfuck coordinator was Flcelloguy, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Flcelloguy/Archive05#Mediation:_List_of_Jewish_jurists who decided not to accept it after all because Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters ordered him not to]. He [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Poetlister#Re:Mediation passed it to Redwolf24, who was on a brothel tour at the time]. They quite naturally got the fair trial that they were expecting, and halfway through it [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kelly_Martin&diff=30833047&oldid=30829121 SlimVirgin decided to ask Kelly Martin to ban their arses].

[[Shemale|Kelly Martin]] did as she was told, filing a fake CheckUser request, which proved that they were all hotter than Kelly Martin or SlimVirgin, so Kelly Martin banned the lot of them, stating that "us ugly girls gotta stick together".  [http://nonbovine-ruminations.blogspot.com/2007/08/regrets.html Kelly Martin later claimed that the whole thing had been a load of bullshit, and that she now regrets ever siding with SlimVirgin].

== Poetlister asks for help ==
Poetlister noticed that [[User:Blissyu2|Zordrac]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/SlimVirgin2&diff=prev&oldid=31823429 had vehemently supported SlimVirgin in her Request for Comment] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/SlimVirgin2&diff=prev&oldid=31863255 because he thought it was nice] that SlimVirgin went out of her way to help Daniel Brandt.

*Poetlister emailed Zordrac saying: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZordrac&diff=32275590&oldid=32255327 "Help me please!"]

*Zordrac replied: [[TITS OR GTFO]].  I love your pics, but I'm ready to come back as my first account, Internodeuser, and support you because the ban is about to wear off.

*Poetlister, suddenly banned and without support, provided some [[porn]].

[[Image:weapons_of_mass as uploaded by blissyu2.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Poetlister desperately seeks the way back to wikipedia]]

*Zordrac: *** fap fap [[fap]] ***

*Poetlister: Zordrac?

*Zordrac: *** fap fap fap *** Hold on.

*Poetlister: Please?

*15 minutes later, Zordrac leapt in to action, and decided to help her out, after extracting a promise of more tit shots to come.

== The protests ==

The complaints about the bans led to major Wikipedia melodrama on their Administrator's Noticeboard.  Bonaparte, [[Mistress Selina Kyle]] and [[Grace Note]] jumped in.  Zordrac created a sub page [[User:Zordrac/Poetlister]] with the evidence.  

SlimVirgin banned Bonaparte, accusing him of being a sock puppet, and did the same for Zordrac.  Whilst she also accused MSK of being a sock puppet, she managed to escape banishment thanks to the trolling of [[Malber]].  Grace Note only escaped banishment when he started to accuse the entire staff of [[Wikipedia Review]] of being holocaust deniers.  MSK finally fell when she confronted [[Kelly Martin]] in Star Wars 2: The Attack on the Userboxes.  

Most of the bans were eventually overturned, and they all went stupidly back to doing frenzied volunteer work for a [[Wikipedia|bad cause]].

== A new hope ==

[[Runcorn]] began editing at about the time that the beautiful people were banned; after becoming an admin, he decided to prove his independence by helping them out. According to the [[Bureaucratic Fuck|Wikipedoe]]s, these "beautiful people" are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Runcorn all puppets of Runcorn].

== Revenge of the Sith ==

SlimVirgin came up with a plan.  She would [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=SlimVirgin&page=User%3AZordrac%2FPoetlister delete the user page Runcorn had created to protest the ban of the beautiful ones] and then [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=SlimVirgin&page=User%3AZordrac perma-ban Zordrac].  She and her new apprentice Grace Note were able to influence the [[Bureaucratic Fuck|community]] and encourage them to destroy Runcorn and the beautiful ones.

All who protested the ban were themselves banned.

== Where are they now? ==
Poetlister fled to [http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Poetlister Wikiquote].  She was [http://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiquote:Village_pump&diff=next&oldid=499274 protected there] by people immune from the forces marshalled by the dark side, who [http://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiquote:Requests_for_adminship&diff=prev&oldid=443946 even made her an admin].  Taxwoman fled even further, to be [http://www.londonfetishscene.com/wipi/index.php/Special:Listusers/sysop an administrator] on [http://www.londonfetishscene.com/wipi/index.php/User:Taxwoman Wipipedia], a world that Wikipedia thought it had destroyed after a long battle involving three AfDs and a DRV. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wipipedia_%28third_nomination%29]  The whereabouts of the others are a mystery.

== Harry Potter trivia ==
Runcorn is the name of a character in J K Rowlings' latest [[Harry Potter]] book, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows".  Runcorn worked for Voldemort and Umbridge, tracking down mages of impure blood. Harry Potter's group incapacitated Runcorn and then Harry impersonated him by using a polyjuice potion. Spoiler: Runcorn doesn't die in the book.

The wikipedian Runcorn was banned three months before the Harry Potter book came out.

Are they all friends with J K Rowling?  Did super spy [[SlimVirgin]] know what was going to happen in the book six months before it was released?

Even [[Malber]]'s super spoilers didn't pick this one up!


==Taxwoman==
Taxwoman only exists [[OTI]] but has been writing lots of shit on Fred Bauder's Wiki [http://www.internet-encyclopedia.org/index.php?title=User:Taxwoman&redirect=no]. Now as an average [[EDiot]], I've read lots of sick shit like sex stories, messed up stuff on [[b/]], and seen nasty pictures like [[pain series]], can go through the entire [[baby fuck]] that ends where a guy rapes a baby and rips it in half until it dies; even worse I have seen lots of nasty [[furry]] porn on ED full of [[scat]], [[piss]], and [[vore]] combined together, and I can even get through [[funnelgirl]] without puking and sometimes watch it for fun ... but even I had to do a double-take reading some of the sick shit Taxwoman not just writes about, but writes about in such a cold, detached way it's reminiscent of a serial killer, making it all the more disturbing.  One such example is the many ways to inhumanly compress the intestines with medieval torture devices while the person receives an enema all to make the enema work faster and then have the person with the enema jump around on the floor like a worm apparently to .... (I'm not sure??) spread disease, fecal bacteria, and fecal parasites.

You know massage parlors where they give that little extra, either full release or sex? Well Taxwoman is one of those accountants where you can have her do your taxes and then perform BDSM on you.

{{Spoiler|RachelBrown, Poetlister, Taxwoman, Brownlee, Newport, Londoneye, and Runcorn are [[sockpuppet|ALL THE SAME PERSON!]]  Why else do the always use proxies?!?!?!?}}

Rewind to the start of 2005.  It was a hot summer's day, the wind was blowing, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Kingstonjr five of the most gorgeous babes ever to grace the cover of Ralph magazine] decided to do what all uber hot girls do when they are bored - they decided to edit Wikipedia.

== The famous five ==

The first one decided to use her real name - [[Rachel Brown]].  She was a hot, tall blonde with racy curves, a polite demeanor, straight laced.  She edited infrequently, being far too hot to waste time on a stupid online encyclopaedia.  Men the internet over drooled at her uber hot photo.

Then Rachel Brown invited one of her friends, who chose to be called [[Poetlister]], the Statistician.  With glorious wavy blonde hair, a girl's next door look, and the hottest body you could imagine, she appealed to geeks the world over.

[[Image:Taxwoman's friend.JPG|thumb|right|Don't you dare cross Taxwoman]]
[[Image:Aniface.gif|frame|right|Or you want to cross her]]

Next came [[Taxwoman]], the hot dominatrix accountant with the sultry brown skin, who loved nothing more than posting semi-naked photos of herself - and her friends, in compromising positions.  She oozed sex, and in spite of turning down every single advance that any of the Wikipediots could come up with, she created an enormous following, especially with her sexy writing on [[BDSM]] articles, and her pictures to match.

Then came [[Londoneye]], who had an "eye" for London.  

The last to join the troupe was [[Newport]], the only one of the group not to put her own pictures on the internets.  She was apparently just so uber hot that she didn't want to destroy innocent eyes.

The five became known as "the beautiful people" and won every award for hottest Wikipediot that could ever be imagined.  Wikipedians begged for them to go to their Wikipedia fests, as they were better than the usual gang of transsexuals like [[Ambi]] and [[Kelly Martin]], or the manic [[Durova]], and they even made [[Angela Beesley]] look plain.

== The beautiful people vs the [[Cabal]] ==

Then problems began when RachelBrown decided to edit one of Wikipedia's many controlled articles, List of Jewish Jurists.  She came up against [[Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters]], who insisted that whereas he could decide who was and wasn't a Jew without quoting a source, mere mortals had to provide sources - and ones that he approved of.  He called for assistance from [[SlimVirgin]].  She began by insisting that it was wrong to add too many Jews, because she was scared that someone on [[Stormfront]] might see them, and SlimVirgin was so concerned that someone who wasn't a Jew might get persecuted by Nazis.  SlimVirgin's friend [[Alex Linder]] helped SlimVirgin out by even posting a link for her, to further justify her claims.  "See?" said SlimVirgin.

But then RachelBrown struck back by providing such good references that even Lulu had to accept them.  So SlimVirgin had to change the rules on references.  SlimVirgin, with her superior ability to edit Wikipedia for 397 hours in a row, was able to change all of the rules so that RachelBrown lost. 

Then RachelBrown called on help from the beautiful people, and along came [[Poetlister]] to the rescue.  They were joined by lovestruck Wikinerds like Arniep and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Antidote#User:IZAK IZAK] who all ganged up against SlimVirgin.

SlimVirgin had help from known anti-semite [[Nazi|Antidote]], who for his own personal reasons decided that it was best to list less Jews, because, being an anti-semite himself, he didn't want to be targeting people who weren't really Jews.  But SlimVirgin didn't like to have help from an actual Nazi, since she was all keen on pretending that she was doing it for the Jews.  So she cried in front of known faggot [[Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters]], who rushed to her rescue, and took on the beautiful people, and attacked them for their lack of fashion sense.

Antidote also helped out [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Antidote by creating a massive sock puppet army], and SlimVirgin promised not to ban him, just so long as he kept on attacking people she hated.

At the end of this, [[Rachel Brown]] and [[Poetlister]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_mediation&diff=32278670&oldid=32276641#List_of_Jewish_jurists called for a mediation between themselves, SlimVirgin and Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters].  Their impartial mediator was Flcelloguy, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Flcelloguy/Archive05#Mediation:_List_of_Jewish_jurists who decided not to bother with it because Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters ordered him not to] and then [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Poetlister#Re:Mediation passed it all over to Redwolf24, who was on holiday].  They quite naturally got the fair trial that they were expecting, and halfway through it [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kelly_Martin&diff=30833047&oldid=30829121 SlimVirgin decided to ask Kelly Martin to ban their arses].

[[Kelly Martin]] did as she was told, and filed a fake CheckUser request, which proved that they were all far hotter than Kelly Martin or SlimVirgin, so Kelly Martin decided to ban the lot of them, plus Taxwoman, stating that "us ugly girls need to stick together".  [http://nonbovine-ruminations.blogspot.com/2007/08/regrets.html Kelly Martin later admitted that the whole thing was a load of bullshit, and she now regrets ever siding with SlimVirgin].

== Poetlister asks for help ==
[[Image:Weapons of masss.jpg|thumb|Poetlister can be very persuasive.]]
Poetlister had noted Zordrac [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/SlimVirgin2&diff=prev&oldid=31823429 had vehemently supported SlimVirgin in her Request for Comment] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/SlimVirgin2&diff=prev&oldid=31863255 because he thought it was nice] that SlimVirgin went out of her way to help Daniel Brandt.  Says Poetlister, "Well, at least he's there and isn't being bossed about by Lulu".


*Poetlister emailed Zordrac with: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZordrac&diff=32275590&oldid=32255327 "Help me Obi Wan! You must help me find Luke!"]

*Zordrac replied: [[TITS OR GTFO]].  I'm retired from Wikipedia, ready to come back with a whole new identity as the ban from my first account, Internodeuser, is about to wear off.

*Poetlister suddenly found herself banned.  And in a situation of crisis, Poetlister always provides ---->

*Zordrac: *** fap fap [[fap]] ***

*Poetlister: Zordrac?

*Zordrac: *** fap fap fap *** Hold on.

*Poetlister: Please?

*15 minutes later, Zordrac leapt in to action, and decided to help her out with the promise of more tits to come.

== The protests ==

The complaints about the bans led to the single largest Wikipedia melodrama ever to wage war on Wikipedia's Administrator's Noticeboard.  The rebel fleet, led by commander Zordrac, with help from Bonaparte, [[Mistress Selina Kyle]] and [[Grace Note]] attacked the death star at its most vulnerable spot.  As rebel fighters continued to be shot down, Luke would not give up.  He created a sub page, [[User:Zordrac/Poetlister]] and defied them, dared them to read through the evidence, and see what would happen.  He was prepared to die a sorry death just to see the destruction of the death star and the return of the beautiful ones to Wikipedia.

In the end, SlimVirgin banned Bonaparte, accusing him of being a sock puppet, and did the same for Zordrac.  Whilst she also accused MSK of being a sock puppet, she managed to escape banishment thanks to the trolling of [[Malber]].  Grace Note only escaped banishment when he started to accuse the entire staff of [[Wikipedia Review]] of being holocaust deniers.  MSK finally fell when she confronted [[Kelly Martin]] in Star Wars 2: The attack of the Userboxes.  

The end result of the protests was that most admins agreed that it was all a crock of shit, and was just SlimVirgin's way to win some lame assed edit war, and not to have to compete with fabulous Ralph covergirls.

The bans were overturned, and they all went back to work, as well as another of their friends [[Brownlee]], who, like Newport, never uploaded a photo.

== A new hope ==

[[Runcorn]], a new user who began editing at about the time that the beautiful people were banned, was a perfect editor, who quickly became an administrator.  Most Wikipediots wanted the beautiful people to be administrators, so Runcorn was seen as the next best thing.  Runcorn started to worship the beautiful people, doing everything he could to help them out.

With Runcorn on the task, SlimVirgin was losing her lame edit wars and the force was with the beautiful ones.

==Wikipedia Review==
Poetlister was and remains an admin of [[Wikipedia Review]], so [[The Wikipedia Jews|Wikipedia's Hivemind]] wanted her banned.

As for Runcorn, nobody knows to this day who he is, but he may be [[Lir]] who used to be on Wikipedia Review until he got banned from that site for always flirting with Poetlister.  I mean, it's normal for every guy to occasionally ask The beautiful people--Poetlister included--for their n00dz but Lir asked several times a day like he's never seen porn before... this really wore these girls out.

== Revenge of the Sith ==

SlimVirgin came up with a plan.  She would [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=SlimVirgin&page=User%3AZordrac%2FPoetlister delete the user page he had created to protest the ban of the beautiful ones] and then [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=SlimVirgin&page=User%3AZordrac perma-ban Zordrac].  Then, with her new apprentice, Darth Grace Note, she was able to influence the senate and encourage them to destroy Runcorn and with him all of the beautiful ones.

Revenge was total.  All people who dared to protest the ban knew full well that they faced total destruction.  Some still defied, and were banned at the mere mention of it.  

Finally Darth SlimVirgin had succeeded and become emperor of the list of Jews and could once again pretend to be a Jewish overlord.  The beautiful people were no more, their hot photos forever purged from the servers, to trouble her no more.

== Where are they now? ==
Poetlister fled to [http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Poetlister Wikiquote].  She was [http://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiquote:Village_pump&diff=next&oldid=499274 protected there] by people immune from the forces marshalled by the dark side, who [http://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiquote:Requests_for_adminship&diff=prev&oldid=443946 even made her an admin there].  Thus Poetlister can sit out the firestorm, and can return if it ever stops.  Taxwoman fled even further, to be [http://www.londonfetishscene.com/wipi/index.php/Special:Listusers/sysop an administrator] on [http://www.londonfetishscene.com/wipi/index.php/User:Taxwoman Wipipedia], a world that Wikipedia thought it had destroyed after a long battle involving three AfDs and a DRV. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wipipedia_%28third_nomination%29]  She has now been appointed as [http://www.internet-encyclopedia.org/index.php?title=User:Taxwoman&redirect=no ambassador from Wipipedia] to the court of [[Fred Bauder]].  The whereabouts of the others are a mystery.

== Harry Potter trivia ==
Runcorn is the name of a character in J K Rowlings' latest ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book, "''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''".  Runcorn worked for Voldemort and Umbridge, tracking down mages of impure blood. Harry Potter's group incapacitated Runcorn and then Harry impersonated Runcorn using a polyjuice potion. Spoiler: Runcorn doesn't die in the book.

Runcorn is also the name of a Wikipedia administrator, who supported [[The beautiful people]] and was banned by [[SlimVirgin]] and [[Durova]] 3 months before the Harry Potter book came out, because [[The Wikipedia Jews]] lied and said he had sock puppets.

Are the beautiful ones friends with J.K. Rowling?  Did super spy [[SlimVirgin]] know what was going to happen in the book 6 months before it was released?

Even [[Malber]]'s super spoilers didn't pick this one up!
