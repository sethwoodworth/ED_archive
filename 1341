[[Image:Jewba.jpg|thumb|120px|Carlos Latuff, the true story.]]

'''Carlos Latuff''' is a [[Brazil]]ian [[devianTART | devianTARTlet]], activist, and megalomaniac who is most renowned for his staunch pro-[[Arab]] [[propaganda]]. There's also the fact that he constantly bitches and whines about being unable to practice free speech on the [[internets]], while at the same time he censors his critics, like the bastard that he is. 

The [[Palestine|Palestinians]] could not have been any closer to getting their land back from the [[Jews|Zionist pigs]], when ol' buddy Latuff had to jump in and fuck it all up on the eve of the millennium. Now with this new hit-and-run propaganda artist, the Zionists are able to sway public opinion in their favor and steal all the [[lulz]] for themselves as they gawk at the poor Arabs who will never have a place to call "home." Another trait which differentiates Latuff from other [[fucktards]] is that he is notorious for hiding comments quicker than a [[ninja]]. Either that, or he just sits at his computer and pounds the F5 key all day and all night. Latuff has also made a series of cartoons that portray [[Israel|Israeli]] Prime Minister Jew, [[United States]] [[President]] [[George W. Bush]], Brazilian president [[shit nobody cares about|Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva]] and [[British]] Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] among other politicians as [[Rosie O'Donnell|monsters]] and [[Nazis]].

Other than constantly dumping turds into his porcelain throne (AKA: devianTART gallery) as often as some random backwards-minded A-rab [[cocksucker]] is burning the flag of a civilized nation, Latuff contributes very little to the general public. The one thing Latuff openly distributed was the [[Machine Code | pseudocode]] he used to develope a devianTART [http://pr0n.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/2/25/Latuff_Promotes_Free_Speech.png automated comment deletion script]:

''<blockquote>IF (comment == empty one-liner that worships me) THEN<br/><blockquote>EXIT</blockquote>ELSE<br/><blockquote>delete comment</blockquote>END IF</blockquote>''

That's not all, however! The U.S. government is after Latuff's ass for doodling cartoons! No, [[Srsly | srsly!]] The government has nothing better to do:

''"Okay, gentlemen. We've got a fuckload of money, '''billions''' of dollars at our disposal, our [[CIA]] agents are in place, and the President has just given us the green light. Time to commence Operation: Sit on Our Lazy Asses and Just Stare at Latuff's New Artwork Submissions All Fucking Day Long!"''

Can you hear it? That's the sound of paranoia seeping through every crevice in Latuff's body:

Due to the lack of skill required to draw such half-assed wanabe comic strips, he is able to dish out new exaggerated comics on a speedy [[bi]]-weekly basis, such as with his ravings over [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/48094368/ Juba, the Baghdad Sniper.] (Don't tell Latuff that "Juba" is a composite propaganda character, just like [[Santa | Santa Claus]] and the Toothfairy, used by Iraqi insurgents.

===Wikipedia===
On April 10, 2007, Latuff "allegedly" ''(obviously)'' tried to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Latuff&diff=121769652&oldid=121760420 vandalize an article about himself on Wikipedia.] The IP address was quickly banned from making any further edits, and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Latuff page] was soon locked. Here is the section Latuff fought to have removed from the article in question:

<blockquote>
'''''Early childhood'''''<br/>

''Born into a family of 7 in Rio de Janeiro to a Brazilian father and an Argentinian mother, Carlos was the fourth child. His father was a middle class worker who was a electrician by trade, and his mother was a school teacher until she had children, which then she became a stay at home mother. Carlos excelled in art class as a young boy. At the age of 12, his parents separated after his mother moved back to Argentina to marry a Jewish man. This apparently is where Carlos started to change. He began to get into trouble at school, he was suspended several times, and he began to isolate himself by drawing.''<br/><br/>

'''''Marriage'''''<br/>

''At the age of 34, Carlos and his soon-to-be husband, Javier, traveled to Toronto, ON where they would undergo vows for marriage. They were married at the Trinity Church in front of over 200 guests from around the world. Carlos has stated that this, "was the happiest moment of my life."''
</blockquote>

[[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is proud to have the only ''genuine'' and ''encyclopedic'' article about Carlos Latuff. He would be so delighted if he accidentally stumbled upon this page. Feel free to [[Carlos Latuff#Contact|show him.]] Latuff was quick to respond to the Wikipedia incident, claiming that he was not born into a family of seven, that his father was not Jewish, and that he [[Not Gay|did not marry a gay man]] at the age of 34. For shame, you Wikipedos! (Wait, maybe they were right all along? We are talking about ''Carlos Latuff'', after all...) Indeed, his shocking statement ironically affirmed an ideology that ED also fully agrees with:

===Palestine===
Latuff is so demented that he makes [http://www.seconddraft.org/ Pallywood] reporters and its army of pathetic actors look like a reputable source. Though he claims to support the Palestinian struggle against the "Israhell," Latuff does them more harm than good with his ridiculous drive-by [http://latuff2.deviantart.com/gallery/ artwork submissions.] This in fact makes him a Jew who gives the Zionists a helping boost on the political battlefront. Oh, the irony of fate!

<center><youtube>mIu8RzD07O0</youtube></center>
If you can figure out [[WTF | what the fuck]] he's saying, ''without'' the assistance of a translator, then you are [[Winnar | TEH WINNAR!]]. All fourteen of his [[zombies|supporters]] would praise him on [[JewTube]], but sorry guys, [[pool's closed|no comments allowed!]]

===United States of America===
[[Image:Latuff Juba Koran.jpg|thumb|115px|left|"Remember, kids! ALWAYS carry a Koran in your front pocket. It makes [[Satan | Allah]] happy! '''KPOW!'''"'']]
[[Image:More Latuff American Propaganda.jpg|thumb|right|115px|U.S. soldiers depicted as selfless heroes? WTF?]]

Parallel to the same reverse logic that has dealt a fierce blow to the Palestinians, Latuff indirectly supports the [[United States]] and cripples the [[Middle East]]. He is an advocate for [[oxymoron|gay rights.]] However, unknown to Latuff is the fact that [[fags|homosexuals]] are granted more freedom in Western societies, such as America, than in the Arab and [[Muslim]] nations that he strongly supports. ''"So then Latuff supports America and the West, because they don't lynch gay people, right?"'' Wrong! Don't forget that Latuff is an idiot. Whichever side makes him the "underdog," he'll take. He loves gays, but not enough to voice his disgust against the very [[religion]]s and cultures that persecute and execute gays.

==Stance on free speech==
Like any freedom-loving, [[ Sean Hannity | Hannity-cheerleading]], flag-waving cunt of an individual, Carlos Latuff strongly [[DO NOT WANT|supports]] both free speech and dissent across all aisles and wakes of life. Of course, "freedom of speech" does not apply to those who disagree with his [[Nazi | Nazi-inspired]] ideologies.

{{Quote|If you agree with my points of views and want to support me, please don't waste your precious time in useless discussions...|Carloss Latuff, [http://latuff2.deviantart.com/journal/4750497/ journal entry]}}

He's right on the money! ''"Please don't waste time in useless discussions, which would lead both sides to agree on a reasonable conclusion. Let us instead resort to blind hatred and propaganda!"'' [[Hitler | Dictator]], anyone?

Latuff never ceases to surprise both his allies and enemies by silencing ''himself'' in a rage of ongoing [http://pr0n.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/a/ae/Latuff_Censoring.png censoring] on his very own journal:
[[Image:Latuff Censoring.png|thumb|left|100px|A commnon exchange of ideas on Latuff's devianTART page.]]

{{Quote|Hidden By Owner|Carlos Latuff}}

He drives a good argument, no? There's no doubt that everyone can relate to his infinite words of wisdom.

So remember kids, the next time you scream at the top of your lungs that you have the God-given right to voice your opinions and ideas in a public arena, make sure that the other [[son of a bitch | sonofabitch]] who disagrees with you is not given the chance to do the same! It's the Carlos Latuff way! Just as an advocate for Latuff states: '''"Latuff loves to ''invoke'' debates, but he'll never ''join'' debates."''' Carlos Latuff's constant hypocrisy and tasteless tactics make even this very website look like a beacon of good morals...

==Supporters==

===[[Izzi (Sileas)|Izzi]] of Sileas: Your typical whiny Latuff worshipper===
[[Image:Izzi Sileas.jpg|thumb|100px|left|HAY GUYS. WHERE'D MY BLOG GO?]]
''Main article: [[Izzi (Sileas)]]''

Yasmine, AKA: Izzi, whose [http://sileas.wordpress.com blog], titled "Sileas" was recently deleted because she couldn't handle the Israeli [[Desu|rape]], is one of Carlos Latuff's biggest [[zombies|supporters.]]

===[[Finkelstein|Norman G. Finkelstein]]===
[[Image:Evil_Finkelstein.jpg|thumb|120px|right|[[Finkelstein]] is a surefire way to ruin one's credibility.]]
Norman G. Finkelstein is a proud supporter of Carlos Latuff's silly Jewish antics. [[Over 9000 | Over nine-thousand]] of his references and sources come directly from Latuff's ''witty'' comics, such as one depicting Alan M. Dershowitz [http://www.flickr.com/photos/96755483@N00/222216939/ masturbating to dead Lebanese civilians.] You're right, Finkelstein, there is no difference. People ''would'' laugh if [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/img/features/latuff/show.php?nam=25 Israel dropped a bomb over a Palestinian town.] How ''isn't'' that funny?

[[Srsly]], if Finkelstein (good thing his name doesn't sound gay) offers to promote your cause or pitch in to support you, run. Run the fuck away and hide. If this guy says the world is round, better update all elementary school Geography textbooks to say "...it's fuckin' ''flat''."

==Opponents==
[[Image:Latuff_Superman_LMFAO.jpg|thumb|right|120px|'''EL OH FUCKING EL''']]

===Common sense: Latuff's greatest foe===
Just about anyone with enough brains to know that you cannot locate [[Israel | Palestine]] on a map is smart enough to know Latuff is full of it. However, it is a hopeless cause to try and knock some sense into this poster child for [[AIDS]]. Trying to debunk Carlos Latuff is like trying to rape a [[BDSM | masochistic]] streaker. Sure it's easy to do, but does he give a fuck?

===Superman===
Latuff has a personal vendetta against [[Superman]] for boning his mother at the exact same time she was giving birth. His very first memory was a huge golden cock getting closer and farther with every passing thrust of the superhero's pelvis. He has vowed to avenge his mother's humilation by taking out his frustration against everyone's favorite ''DC Comics'' character on canvas. (See image on the right.)
