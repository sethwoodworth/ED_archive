Fermi is, by far, the hottest Graphics card on the market today. Originally claimed by some to be "''too hot''"; which was quickly rebuked by nVidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, citing that no Fermi can be "''too'' hot". Jen-Hsun Huang also cited that most of the [[nerds|people]] making these claims had in their possession an [[AMD]] Graphics Card. obviously nullifying their claims

Originally, the Fermi cards were not sold to just anyone. They sold only very few to [[skript kiddies|Cream of the PC gaming Crop]]. This was originally thought to be a problem with low yields (1.7%) but this information was discarded as false by [[fanboys|nVidia Customers]].

== Practical Uses==
Unlike ATI, Fermi cards offer a host of new features (With a newly redesigned core and 3.2 Billion transistors and 512 CUDA cores (480 exposed), the GTX-480 is one cutting edge powerful GPU you won't want to miss!) that make it quite superior to the 5000 series cards. Fermi can be used to make an omelet, burn a house down, Start a forest fire, burn a cross, create an international incident, and CUDA.  Time will tell whether this card will go into the history books as the world greatest graphics processing unit, [[bullshit|but chances are looking good]].

===Chinaman===
[[image:fermi04.jpg|frameless|left|]]
''Chinaman'' is a [[azn|hardcore]] gamer, whom was one of the first to possess a GTX 480. He used this card wisely, and there are many pictures documenting his use of nVidia's top-of-the-line Fermi card.After realizing his pictures had made their way onto ED. He quickly whored out his tripfaggotry on /g/. "Asian Ricer !!x2XTTmvcXn0" and posting a picture of himself timestamped with his tripcode, where he showcased how horridly obese he was. Many believe that the [[lie|most loved]] tripcoder IN elite was the first person to buy a Fermi. But this is false; as IN elite cannot afford anything higher than a 7600GS since he is so [[poor]].
