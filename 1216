It's nearly impossible to find anything that isn't depressing to say about '''Bulgaria'''. However, according to www.bulgariatravel.org "A [[shit|picturesque small]] country called Bulgaria has existed for more than 13 centuries in Europe, linking East and West. Bulgaria remembers ancient civilisations and great people that [[pwn|wrote its turbulent history]]. Situated in Southeastern Europe, Bulgaria occupies the northeastern part of the Balkan Peninsula."

==The depressingly supine history of Bulgaria==

*Pre-45AD
Owned by the [[Greeks]] despite not being Greek. No resistance.
*45-632AD
The [[Roman]]s conquer Bulgaria (Thrace) enslaving 300,000 citizens. No further resistance until the fall of the Roman Empire.
*632-1014AD
The only real time Bulgaria exists as a country. Call it Bulgaria's manic phase. In 718AD they kill 22,000 [[Arab]]s. In 917AD they kill ten of thousands of Greeks.
*1014-1396AD
The Empire strikes back. Byzantine Emperor Basil II ("[[lulz|the Bulgar-Slayer]]") blinds 15,000 Bulgarian prisoners taken in battle before releasing them. No  resistance or any uprising of the Bulgarian population or nobility after the establishment of Byzantine rule.
*1396-1876AD
[[Muslim]]s beat Christians in Bulgaria. The losing side, thought to number several thousand, are bound together and marched naked before the Sultan where a group of executioners proceeds to kill them, either by decapitation or by severing their limbs from the body. No resistance to Ottoman rule for five centuries.
*1876-1914AD
The Turks massacre 15,000 Bulgarians, causing [[Russia]] to invade Bulgaria and end Ottoman rule.
*1914-1918AD
During [[World War I]], Bulgaria finds itself fighting on the losing side. The Bulgarian army suffers 300,000 casualties, including 100,000 killed.
*1940-1945AD
Bulgaria sides with the [[Nazi]]s. In early September the Soviet Union declares war on Bulgaria and invades it, meeting no resistance.
*1945-1990AD
Communist, owned by Russia. No resistance.
*1957AD
Development of Golden Sands and Sunny Beach resorts begin. No resistance.
*1990AD-2010AD
Bulgaria holds multi-party elections and privatizes its economy, but economic difficulties and a tide of corruption leads over 800,000 Bulgarians, most of them qualified professionals, to emigrate in a "brain drain" from a country with not a great deal of brains to spare. Russian [[mafia]] takes over. No resistance.
*2010AD-present
Bulgaria is enslaved by the police and the government. No resistance.
