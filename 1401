Cephalopods
Anything that is known to invade [[teh]] [[vagina]]. Also, a cause of [[feminism]]. Because of the [[your mom|Law of your mom]], a person with gender cannot become a cephalopod, even through [[unbirthing]]. If something is [[old meme]], then chances are it is somehow related to cephalopods. Every bad video, [[online quiz]], journal, and forum has a cephalopod in it. You yourself may have a cephalopod in you. No, don't look. You'll just make it angry.

Thanks to the invention of [[asslink]] connections, parts of the internet can now become cephalopods. Theoretically, an azn could fit an entire forum up there. All she needs to do is take the Asslink out of her ass and put it [[vagina|where]] her [[cell phone]] goes.

While sometimes visibly similar to encephalopods, which invade one's brain, they are quite different.

Most cephalopods are impartial regarding their choice of cunt. The [[fact]] that some cunts posses more cephalopods has more to do with the way they are exchanged. For some, cephalopods are like pokemon; the more you have the bigger your girpenis.
It is very important that, before [[fisting|spelunking]], the diver check for cephalopods. Most cephalopods do not get [[emo|aggro]] on visitors unless attacked or threatened with crushing, though some cephalopod's natural food source is any intruder in its current home.
