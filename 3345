== Bad Cop ==
Asking me to unban you will probably make me block your IP from the server at the application level. That means no [[ljdrama]], no [[frienditto]] and obviously no [[lulz]]. [[Special:Listadmins|These people]] are sysops, try begging them first. But they probably care less than I do.

== Infotainment ==
[[girlvinyl]] is awesome.

Best known for her catchphrase: "I did nothing wrong." 

Also she is funny and hot as can be seen by the [http://girlvinyl.com/photo/index.htm wonderful galleries] on her [http://girlvinyl.com website].  Many a lonely Canadian has survived the night due to these superb pictures.  Yum yum.

Girlvinyl is super nice.  She knows more about BSD than you, so don't even fucking try it, you poseur. She will kick your wanna be ass twice over. Smart, sexy, and bad-assed to boot.

Note from GV:

{{quote3|Hi! I often leave comments in the talk pages of articles. If you're the main contributor to the article, just take my comments and see if you want to address them or not. In most ways I'm a regular user like everyone else. I just write a lot in the talk pages because I'm busy and don't often have time to edit. Let me reiterate: I am really busy, so please don't take things I say to be harsh or overly critical. I am attempting to be  constructive 100% of the time. Except when I am tired and/or cranky. Which really doesn't happen that much.}}</noinclude>
