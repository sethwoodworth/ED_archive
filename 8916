'''Warren G. ([[Gangsta|Gamaliel]]) Harding''' was the first President of the [[United States]] to have [[negro]] ancestry. Thanks to Harding's glorious trailblazing in 1920, the current pretender to the same title, [[Barack Hussein Obama|Barack Osama Saddam bin Laden-Hussein]], is eighty-eight years too late: '''88''' what a motherfuckin' coincidence. 

[[Stephen Colbert]] and his [[fan]] army recently promoted the shade of Warren G. Harding to "minor Internet meme" as "Warren Gangstah Harding", which he will probably appreciate if there is life after death - Harding sure as hell deserves it as a man who '''really''' knew how to [[Party Hard|have a good time]].


==Warren G. Harding: [[Negro|Nigrah]] Ancestry==

===First President with African-American Heritage is so Unlike Obama===

[[Image:warren g.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Warren G. in the bling of office.]]

Warren G. Harding was one of eight children of a family of [[Redneck|crackah]]s and near-[[negro|nigrah]]s passin' fo' [[White People|white]] and was almost an octoroon according to some accounts. His story is a little like the better-known success story of another octoroon, [[gay|J. Edgar Hoover]], America's one-man answer (two, if you count his boyfriend Clive) to the KGB. Harding, to his credit, appears not to have shared Hoover's tastes for [[blackmail]] and closet [[homosexuality]]. Check the links for [[moar|details]] on Harding's ancestry. 

{{Quote|How should I know? One of my ancestors might have jumped the fence.|Warren Harding|color=red}}

===Early career===
Harding didn't really give a shit about [[politics]], his main interests being sports, [[Alcohol|booze]], [[Secks|adultery]], and running a newspaper, but he married an ambitious wife (nicknamed "the Duchess") who pushed him into becoming lieutenant-governor of [[Ohio]]. Before he even got to the presidential convention, Warren knocked up his [[loli|schoolgirl]] mistress, Nan Britton, daughter of a doctor friend. 

===How he got the [[Republican|'publican]] nom'nation===
Harding lived in a time when America had some crackpot theory called "[[democracy]]", but they really tried a lot harder to make it look like it worked back then, even for the elected [[King|monarch]] (exceptions being all of the bigger cities and rural sites of intensive exploitation, where it was always a form of [[Mafia|organized crime]]). 

Warren G. went through a competitive convention where there was lots of horse trading and endless debate. He wasn't a candidate and didn't even want to be one at first. He only got the nomination on the '''tenth''' ballot because he looked (and sounded, check the link at the bottom of the page) more presidential than the forgotten three who were really going for it and was always up for a good time with bootleg [[Alcohol|booze]], card playin', [[loli|underage lovers]], chewin' 'baccy, and spittin' into spittoons. 

[[Image:Word_the_duchess_wrote_over_Harding.gif|thumb|150px|His wife, the "Duchess", wrote his damned epitaph.]]

The words of the Duchess at the time were prophetic.

{{Quote|I can only see one word written over his head if they make him president, and that word is "Tragedy."|Florence Kling Harding (nee de Wolfe)|An Encyclopedia of Scandal|color=blue}}

==President Harding and the Ohio Gang==
As one of the greatest presidents, Harding brought a criminal gang of cronies to power, dragged his underage mistress to Washington, and had a '''really''' GOOOOOD time in office, along the way spawning and making many cool quotes. People called his administration "The Ohio '''gang'''" at the time. They might also have invented K Street, where a special alternative White House hosted the most unsavory aspects of the administration. Thank the lord, J Street weren't even there back in them ole days.

{{Quote|He invited all his cronies to the White House where they drank and played poker in his study. When Nan Britton arrived, they retired to a private room. Harding liked to sit with his waistcoat unbuttoned, his feet on his desk and a spittoon at his side ...|An Encyclopedia of Scandal|color=red}}

Jesse W. Smith, assistant to Harry Daugherty, the gang's Attorney-General, made a cute theme song for the administration.

{{Quote|My God, how the [[money]] rolls in.|Jesse Smith, "Theme Song for the Harding Administration"|color=blue}}

The office of the Attorney-General became known as the '''Department of Easy Virtue'''; hell, it probably should still be called that. 

Have you seen the film ''Goodfellas''? There is a sequence where the boss Pauley takes over a restaurant and sells truckloads of merchandise off the backs of the trucks at a loss because he's going to burn the place down for the insurance in the end and claim insurance on the goods to boot. 

Harding's Veteran's Bureau chief, Charles Forbes, ran what later became the VA in the same way: selling a million towels that cost 34 cents each for 36 cents a dozen, sheets that cost $1.35 a pair for 27 cents a pair, and [[god]] only knows what else. He also took huge kickbacks for hospital-supply contracts and from real-estate dealers selling him land for more hospitals. Sound [[W|familiar]]?

There was much [[more]].

Towards the end of Harding's time in office (and life) in 1923, a visitor took a wrong turn on a White House tour to find Warren with his hands lovingly clenched around the neck of Forbes, making one of the greatest presidential speeches of all time:

{{Quote|You dirty rat! You double-crossing bastard!|Warren G. Harding to Forbes|An Encyclopedia of Scandal|color=red}}

Harding also made Jesse Smith 'fess up near the end of the three-year [[party]] and, after hearing him out, said

{{Quote|Go home. Tomorrow you will be arrested.|Warrren G. Harding to Smith|An Encyclopedia of Scandal|color=blue}}

Smith [[Budd Dwyer|shot himself]] instead, Forbes's number two did the same, and Harding decided to visit [[Alaska]] (and set a record as the first [[president]] to [[evar]] do that).  

He died on the trip under mysterious circumstances, some say a stroke, some food poisoning, some a heart attack, some (lately some of his [[negro|nigrah]] relatives) assassination. The diagnosis at the time was food poisoning and pneumonia. His schoolgirl mistress Nan Britton wrote a best-seller of [[loli]] [[fanfic]] called ''The President's Daughter'' immediately afterward.

==Posthumous Drama==

[[Image:Five_nigrah_prez.jpg|thumb|250px|Welcome to the fantasy zone (or Haiti).]]

[[Image:Harding shack.jpg|thumb|left|Harding's new crib.]]

===Teapot Dome scandal===
The biggest scandal of the post-Harding years was the Teapot Dome affair, which kept serving up [[drama]] through two presidencies (Coolidge and Hoover) after Harding's death. The chief figure was his Secretary of the Interior, Albert B. Fall, who was found guilty of taking bribes and no-interest personal loans in exchange for leasing public oil fields to his buddies. In 1931 Fall put the term "fall guy" into the lexicon by becoming the first former Presidential Cabinet member to be im[[prison]]ed.

===KKK irony===
In his 1987 book ''The Fiery Cross'', "historian" Wyn Craig Wade claimed that Harding was connected with the [[Ku Klux Klan]], having been initiated in a secret ceremony in the White House basement (or Green Room). Evidence includes taped testimony from [[Some Guy|someone]] claiming to be one of the initiators. Although Harding would be far from the only Klansman to carry a touch of the tar brush, nobody much believes the story because it smells like KKK or CIA disinformation. Besides, everyone knows the only secret thing in the White House basement is the super-multi-combo chapel: [[Church]] of [[Satan]], Skull and Bones clubhouse, and synagogue.

==Harding's Move to Modern [[Lulz]]==

===Harding on "The McLaughlin Group"===

[[Image:You_make_it_sound.GIF|right|thumb|200px|McLaughlin: "You make it sound as though this is the first time we've had a black president."]]

Harding started his [[resurrection]] as a posthumous [[Internet]] [[meme]] with this exchange on ''The MacLaughlin Group''.

{{Quote|Well, we, hah, hah, haven't ...."|Some incoherent Jewess.|color=blue}}

{{Quote|Warren G. Harding was a nigrah!|McLaughlin, waving finger|color=red}}

===Colbert mentions McLaughlin's mention of Harding===

[[Image:Wgharding.png|thumb|left|300px|On Colbert's Threat down!]]

Stephen Colbert used the interesting exchange on his "Threat Report" as a prop to say

{{Quote|I have always, always, had my suspicions about Warren G. Harding. Little-known fact that the "G" stands for "Gangstuh"!|Colbert|color=blue}}

Colbert also used the show to push the [[lie]] that the only people interested in Harding's heritage are white conservatives like McLaughlin: in fact, the keenest interest is clearly from [[negro|nigrah]] folk who are justifiably proud of Harding's 1/8th nigrah heritage (check the links and search for yourself).

===Harding the minor Internet meme===

====Vandal magnet on Wikipedia====

[[Image:Warren_G_Harding_on_wikipedia.png|thumb|right|200px|Warren G. Harding is active on [[TOW]].]]

Stephen Colbert's fan boys and girls understand everything Stephen says as a cryptic command to [[vandal]]ize [[TOW]] and soon got to work, for example: 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_G._Harding&diff=225344825&oldid=225329439],
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_G._Harding&diff=220511965&oldid=220510929],
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_G._Harding&diff=220460386&oldid=220432198], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_G._Harding&diff=232160614&oldid=232160395], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_G._Harding&diff=220475359&oldid=220460949]. 

The [[Bureaucratic Fucks|wikipedo queens]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive431#Immediate_Full_protect_Warren_G._Harding threw the usual drama fits] then
"protected" the article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=protect&page=Warren_G._Harding for three months.] When [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_G._Harding&diff=223834780&oldid=223536214 Grawp joined in] they [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_G._Harding&diff=223838443&oldid=223834898 lifted the level of censorship.]
It is "unprotected" right now so give it all the [[AIDS]] you can!

====Wikia====
Colbert's approval gave the [[meme]] an official sanction for [[wikipedophile]]s, so they put some unrelated [[shit]] on the officially sanctioned [[unfunny]] sites. People who think liking Colbert makes them [[funny]] made a [[lame]] article on [[Unfunnypedia]] (no link; believe, it's for [[you]]r own good). People deluded that they're on the way to being Colbert scriptwriters made an [http://www.wikiality.com/Warren_G._Harding equally lame article] (even worse but very short so less of an insult to the brain) on [[Wikiality]]. 

===Rapper's stage name===
[[Image:Warren_G._Album_Cover_gr.jpg‎|left|200px]]
Here the ghost of Warren G. Harding is conjured up as the stage name (ie: alias) of a rapper.<br>
This trend continued with such greats as Capone, Scarface, Jim Jones and of course, Bushwick Bill.
