Emotion Eric
[[Image:Ericface.jpg|thumb|[[Wat]].]]
'''Emotion Eric''' is a [[Web 1.0]] site from [[at least 100 years ago]] featuring an [[azn]] man who [[camwhore|takes requests]] for conveying any [[emotion]] with his facial muscles. The camwhore himself, Eric Wu, was [[famous]] back around 2002 for winning a [[shit nobody cares about|Webby Award]] thus making him [[notable]] enough to have an [[article]] on [[Wikipedia]].

The website itself is not that [[lulzworthy]], but besides the most basic emotions that can be found on the site some of his really [[bizarre]] requests are to do things that are not really emotions at all. The [[fact]] that the website itself is not really that funny or amusing just goes to show [[b|how much the internets]] has improved since the early part of the decade of the '00s - you can pretty much get any [[hawt]], [[secret fatty]] [[camwhore]] to do emotions for [[you]] and that's much more fun and [[pleasure]]able than watching a little [[azn]] man make stupid faces [[amirite]]?

It is also believed that Eric Wu is the cousin of the [[NO U]] guy. Unfortunately, we have no verifiable sources to back this assertion up. He also hasn't updated the site since 2004 - i.e. since [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] was created. Again, it is not known why.
