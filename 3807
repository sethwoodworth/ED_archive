Hurrchan is a [[Penis|small]], badly-coded imageboard.  It's relatively empty at the time being, either from just recovering from several months of downtime and then a few weeks of being stuck on a shitty free host that [[fail|didn't allow porn]] or simply having NO USERS.  Hurrchan's philosophy used to be anti-anonymous and anti-raid, but that was largely due to Katie's moralfaggotry.  No one really gives a shit at this point, either due to laziness or too much [[jenkem]] and Hurrchan links to [[Rockstarchan|Rockstarchan's]] /i/.

[[File:Hurr.irc.su.jpg|thumb|200px|hurr.irc.su's server.]]
Hurrchan was born out of the IRC channel #hurr on hurr.irc.su, a shitty server of trolls, assholes, /g/entlemen, and bitchy <strike>femanons</strike>trolls acting like femanons that had been causing general [[fail]] and shitty obnoxious trolling for a few months already.  #hurr acquired a reputation for trolling asspies, attacking other IRC servers with floods of proxies, and frequent downtime.  Then, one day, a magical idea occurred... to create a chan shitty enough to outdo every previous chan.

==Notable Boards==

==Drama==
[[File:Fuck404.png|thumb|200px|[[no|The word "Jew" is still a fresh and funny internet insult amirite guise? ...guise?]]]]

Naturally, a clusterfuck full of nothing but tripfags and <strike>femanons</strike>trolls acting like femanons is licensed to supply drama in spades:

===vs. Trapchan===

A [[100 years ago|long time ago]], a lulzfest began when Lyssa from trapchan started pissing in hurrchan's ocean of piss;  Lyssa claimed that hurrchan [[DMCA|stoled]] her boards, completely ignoring the fact she completely copied [[tranny|tranchan]].  Soon enough she received a [[GTFO|k-line]]. A few days later, former trapchan admin and at that time hurrchan mod haxed trapchan into an oblivion of [[win|403 errors]];  Lyssa, being a total milky lolcow (and not one bit [[retard|stupid]]) blamed this entirely on some Artix instead.  Naturally, when you're involved in some important shit like this, [[noone|lots of people]] [[nobody cares|pay attention]] to you.  

Soon enough, Lyssa came back with more [[butthurt]], this time over hurrchan now [[wat|stealing her traps]].  No one really gave a shit what she had to say anymore, since it was decided she was simply a [[attention whore|common]] [[16 year old girl]] and derpcat had started handing out k-lines for displays of faggotry.  Somehow, trapchan has a near exact copy of hurrchan's old [[OH SHI-|stylesheets]], but Hurrchan moved on since they were ugly and looked like they were made of a pile of dead negro crackwhores.

===Old Server===

Hurrchan's old host [[win|kicked them out]] without warning after some [[moar]] IRC drama and massive amounts of trolling, most of which involved jews.  They completely [[fail|failed]] at security however, and [[lol|left unencrypted passwords]] lying around in publicly-readable areas of the server which happened to be the exact same as the root password. Never one to miss the opportunity to do whatever he wants despite hurrchan's [[hypocrisy|anti-/i/nsurgency pledge]], derpcat [[delete fucking everything|rm -rf'd]] both of their servers [[for great justice]], and the next morning tears of [[butthurt]] flooded the entire server, nearly drowning servers nearby with it.  Sadly, the potential amount of lulz was minimized as moralfaggotry was allowed 

===Sparky===
The <strike>most annoying</strike> tripfag on 4chan's /g/, sparky4, was trolled to no end by #hurr, the IRC channel that eventually [[fail|became]] hurrchan.  Sparky's shitty IRC server, running on [[Fail|Windows ME]] was linked with hurr.irc.su at one point, until derpcat [[trolled]] sparky into [[ragequit|leaving in a fit of butthurt]].  Sparky, being the [[aspie|asspie]] that he is couldn't figure out how to change his IRCop password an entire month after the servers were unlinked.  Derpcat found this password and proceeded to completely fuck over sparky's IRC server with 5 users total.  Lulz were had by #hurr and /g/, and everyone assumed sparky had learned not to be a complete fucktard.

Sadly, his fucktardery continued in massive doses.  In the second dose of [[raids|/i/nsurgency]] against sparky, a #hurr user was given IRCop powers by sparky due to the massive flood of spambots coming from derpcat's proxy flooder.  The server was [[raped]] and [[win|taken down once moar]].  After it was taken down and security was tightened, derpcat proceeded to get sparky's shitty subdomains 4ch.us.to and 4ch.ath.cx [[banned]] from their hosts and his Comcast line suspended for several weeks.  His oper password while he was linked with Helldive was acquired, and derpcat proceeded to cause as much damage to the server as possbile before banned by januszeal.  Sparky's dox and pics of him [[faggot|crossdressing]] were dropped on /g/, but the lulz had dried up over time since nobody gave a shit.  All of /g/ still hates sparky, except for 1 or 2 other asspies.  His threads are generally filled with quality homosexual pornography, [http://www.hurrchan.net/goar/ gore], and [[sage]].  If you see a thread on /g/ with something like "WWWWWWWWW DO U LIKE TO WEAR SKIRTS GEE?", do not approach it.

===Hurrchan.net/Hurr.ca Split===
Some time in May of 2010, site admins derpcat and Katie started a massive oper war in #hurr, citing irreconcilable differences <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">&#91;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources|''citation&nbsp;needed'']]&#93;</sup>.  Derpcat had been promoting lulz, trolling, and [[raids|rAIDS]] for the past few months while Katie had been promoting anti-lulz, moralfaggotry, and faggotry in general.

Immediately after Katie raged at derpcat for deleting & banning an ugly trap for their shitty thread on Hurrchan and [[Fail|somehow forgetting that derpcat owned the IRC server]], she was banned from IRC and hurr.ca was rm -rf'd.  Derpcat then banned everyone who Katie put in power as a mod and moved the hurrchan.net domain to its own server, which then rapidly broke and wasn't brought back online until several weeks later.

Katie moved her IRC channel to rizon and filled it and hurr.ca with all manners of moralfaggotry. The #hurr IRC chatroom, usually deader than [[Matthew Shepard]], was graced with frequent visits by spambots, repeating scathing insults such as "U Mad" and "I once ate a dog's dick" until banned by the channel's own bot.  Due to Rizon's huge amount of shittiness, many of these open proxies were allowed through to flood until they timed out.

Or is it something else entirely, something more sinister?  After years of [[troll|trolls trolling trolls]] on the virtual landscape of the internet, have machines themselves taken a cue from humanity and evolved to the stage of bots banning bots?  Perhaps the breakup and the mayhem it caused to [[No|one of the most popular and influential chans]] sent shockwaves through cyberspace and effected a change not unlike that of the [[Final Fantasy 7|meteor]] that some scientists [[shit nobody cares about|probably theorize]] carried the first seeds of life to earth, jump-starting evolution like a livewire to the testicles.

It's difficult to say what all of this means or how the pieces fit together, but [[lie|all eyes are watching closely to see how this exciting event unfolds]].  If you have any further information on this <strike>potentialy explosive</strike>boring barrel of drama, stand up, speak out and tell your [[virgin|grandchildren]] "I was there.  I was a part of history."

Somewhere in the mess of drama, Katie's [[Kimmo Alm|ILLEGAL CLONE OF HURRCHAN]] was ignored by her and flooded with CP.  Upon noticing this, derpcat fired off [[over 9000]] abuse emails to the host, paypal, google adsense, and godaddy, pointing out the CP.  The site is currently dead and took out chan3 as collateral damage.  Having stopped giving a shit about it, Katie gave up on running hurr.ca and gave the domain to derpcat.

=== Tacticalchan ===
A horribly shitty little chan known as Tacticalchan saw fit to <strike>hack into</strike>find the install.php file still left on the server and use it on musicchan and [[delete fucking everything]].  The [[RockstarChan|rockstar military]] then proceeded to shitflood every one of tacticalchan's boards with gore and the same exact pic of [[Alisa Kuzmenko]].  It was leaked that derpcat was behind the dead dog dump and tacticalchan attempted to spam Hurrchan's wiki with about two edits, but didn't realize that [[Retard|every edit to a wiki is revertible]].  Derpcat then reported tacticalchan for invalid WHOIS info, and hijacked their formspring.me and twitter.  2 weeks later they were forced to pay for WHOIS protection.

==Other Shitty Content==

===IRC===
If it's possible to have moar net splits than [[:File:Rizon-lol.jpg|Rizon]], this IRC has done it; Whether it be derpcat [[Retard|tripping the breaker the server is on]] or a cat knocking the ethernet cord out, there is always a net split.  Also contains FML spam from bots, ircop drama, and global announcements about jews doing WTC, with [[jews did wtc]]] being totally original and interesting global announcement there at any given moment in time.  The server had been linked at many places in it's pathetic lifetime, including the original Hurr IRC from the days where Katie was still around, tsukiIRC, helldive, and finally back to tsukiIRC after helldive's death.

===Wiki===
Hurrchan [[shitty|official]] [http://www.hurrchan.net/wiki wiki] full of [[Database Error|database errors]].  Also a few decent guides on Kusaba X mods and [[G|techloligy]], along with a huge one on tripcodes and tripcodan programs to [[fail|create even more obnoxious tripfags]].


===Anontalk BBS Clone===
<strike>Hurrchan has an ATBBS text board, /tiny/, also [http://kimmo.eats.shit.la/ kimmo.eats.shit.la].  Currently has no name/tripcode system, but is designed to match the rest of the chan's theme: ''sucking large amounts of [[Mac|penis]]''.  Has 2 or 3 shity threads.</strike> Also dead.
