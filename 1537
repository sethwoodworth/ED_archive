Starting on March 15, 2005, '''Sonichu The Electric Hedgehog Pokémon''', the horrifying product of notorious overweight man-child [[Chris-chan]]'s feeble, autistic mind — is a webcomic hybrid of the two already-established video game characters of Sonic the Hedgehog and Pikachu — was published on the internet, with the sole intention of scarring the minds of the uninitiated masses, and forever searing the crayon-rendered terror into the widened retinas of the innocent. Over the years, Chris's [[shit|webcomic]] has served as a medium through which he reinvents his experiences in real life. These events include his [[failure|adventures]] at the local mall where he is accompanied by his [[fanfic|imaginary friend]] [[Mary Sue|Sonichu]] and [[raped|ambushed]] by Jerkops (a portmanteau of "[[Jerk|jerk]]" and "[[Cop|cop]]"). 

Most of his [[RAGE|rage]] and [[retard|artistic inspiration]] comes from the fact that he was [[Police|arrested]] for being a creepy fucking [[Stalker#Stalkers|stalker]] [[IRL|at the mall]], and resisting arrest. The comic's plots center around Chris, Sarah (a former female friend that shared a platonic relationship with him) and her villainous girl-stealing boyfriend, people gaining [[fursuit|the ability to transform into hedgehogs]], elderly people getting killed, depictions of [[DO NOT WANT|Sonichu and Rosechu fucking]] and a failed attempt at [[loli]].

The comic's main characters were [[Mary Sue|Sonichu]], a [[lame|Pikachu/Sonic hybrid]], and CWC, who for [[bestiality|some reason]] is Sonichu's father. (Since Sonichu's supposed to be eighteen, this results in them born within ten years of each other!) Supporting roles consist primarily of [[Mary Sue|electric hedgehogs]] who pretty much hang around [[Srsly|having sex the entire time]]. Eventually, Chris [[Attention Whore|stole the spotlight]] by making himself the comic's main character, and now the entirety of the comic [[facepalm|focuses on him]] and all of his personal predispositions.  He writes himself as being idolized as a god by all of his hedgehog friends who, throughout the comic, assist him in the endeavors of his "[[Rape|love]] [[LARP|quest]]".

The comic takes elements from all of the following; all meshed together with Chris' [[autism|creativity]]:
*''[[Pokemon]]''
*''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]''
*''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''
*''[[Yu-Gi-Oh]]''
*''[[Sailor Moon]]''
*''[[Inuyasha]]''
*''[[South Park]]''
*''[[Animu|Excel Saga]]''
*[[Chris-chan/People|Christian Weston Chandler's personal life]]

==The Official Comic==

The whole thing is avaliable on [http://anonym.to/?http://cogsdev.110mb.com/cwcipedia/index.php/Sonichu_Comic_Collection Chris-Chan's very own wiki] for your reading pleasure. But for the sake of sanity, and brevity, a summary is also avaliable below.
===Issue #0===
[[Image:SonichuIssuezero.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sonichu #0: The Nightmare Begins]]
Super Sonic [[I accidentally X|accidentally a Pikachu]] while fighting a blue tentacle monster, and somehow shits out Sonichu and Rosechu. The two meet and immediately [[Sex|fall in OMG TRUE LOVE.]] Back in CWCville, Sonichu fights [[Retard|Naitsirhc]], who has kidnapped Rosechu (totally original, [[amirite]]?) but easily kicks his ass because he's a ''Pokemon''-playing [[faggot]]...[[irony|just like Chris-chan himself]].{{clear}}

===Issue #1===
[[Image:SonichuIssueone.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sonichu #1: Racial Issues]]
Naitsirhc, [[DOUBLE NIGGER|Dr. Eggman]], and Giovanni create a Sonichu clone for [[I did it for the lulz|no good reason]], but some dumbfuck scientist spills cherry cola on it and turns it into a black person. Blachu/Black Sonichu/whatever is sent on a mission to  [[Rape|kidnap]] Rosechu,  succeeds at first, then predictably gets his ass kicked when Sonichu and his faggot knock-off Sonic decide to team up. {{clear}}

===Issue #2===
[[Image:SonichuIssue2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sonichu #2: Electric Boogaloo]]
Chris-chan and Sonichu fulfill an "[[Spellcheck|anchuent]]" Cherokee prophecy so that Chris can change into a [[furfag]] along with Sarah Hammer and her boyfriend Wes Iseli. Wes tries to [[cap]] Chris-chan but is [[pwned]] by Sarah who promptly breaks up with him. Chris has hopes of [[sex|getting it on]] with Sarah, but this never happens. For no apparent reason, some gigantic rock monster controlled by Mary Lee Walsh tries to destroy CWCville. The trio kick its ass using their [[Fail|awesome]] furfag powers. Unfortunately, Chris-chan fails to die during the battle.{{clear}}

===Issue #3===
[[Image:SonichuIssue3.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sonichu #3: Night of the Living Recolors]]
Chris-chan shits out another five useless Sonichu [[Recoloring|recolors]], each based on another Pokemon and having [[Mary Sue|unique]] traits: [[Metapod|Wild Sonichu]], [[Mudkip|Bubbles Rosechu]], [[Nun|Angelica Rosechu]], [[Azn|Punchy Sonichu]], and [[Emo|Magi-chan Sonichu]]. Blachu, like the nigger he is, steals a sunstone or something from a bird furry living on a floating island that is [[lie|totally not Angel Island or anything]]. The five recolors meet and form the Chaotic Combo, who team up with Sonichu to [[racism|go lynch Blachu]]. Then they talk about teamwork or some shit. On a side note, Chris-chan managed to keep his fat ass out of the comic this time... {{clear}}

===Issue #4===
[[Image:SonichuIssue4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sonichu #4: BAWWWWWWWW]]
...but not for long. In this issue, Chris-chan whines about how he can't [[sex|get any]] and how the [[cops|Jerkops]] are keeping him from having a [[boyfriend|girlfriend]]. He then puts on his [[fursuit]] to go fight some fatass black mall cop, and tries to kill him by shouting [[Dragonball_Z|"CURSE-YE-HA-ME-HA!"]] Then, he chronicles how he got his heart broken by an epic troll who asked him out on a date, and bitches at Mary Lee Walsh for doing her job. [[LOL WUT|Chris-chan's ears turn into wings]], allowing him to defeat her. He somehow creates a female clone of himself called Crystal, who ALSO turns into another fucking Sonichu; only '''this''' time she's a [[Sailor Moon|Sailor Soldier]] too. Some other shit happens, but [[no one cares]] because [[Tl;dr|there are not many lulz to be had in this issue.]]{{clear}}

===Issue #5===
[[Image:SonichiIssue5.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sonichu #5: OMG SO KAWAII]]
Chris-chan decides his comic isn't [[Wapanese|KAWAII]] enough for his new TRUE LOVE Megan, so he decides to [[weeaboo]] it up by giving everyone [[anime]] [[Amuria|SHINY DESU]] eyes. [[Srsly|Chris's best friend Sarah gets married to a ''Yu-Gi-Oh'' character]] but Wes comes back to fuck everything up. Chris has to get Megan to [[Fail|save the day for him]]. Meanwhile, the Jerkops are [[Cockblock|cockblocking]] everyone in CWCville, so Chris and his legion of recolors have to save the day. Crystal gets locked in a dark mirror for some reason, and Megan cries in Chris's arms, which everyone knows [[Unrealistic Expectations|will never happen in real life]].{{clear}}

===Issue #6===
[[Image:SonichuIssue6.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sonichu #6: Even More Plagiarism]]
Chris's [[dog]] died. Rather than [[BAWWWWW]] like ANY OTHER NORMAL PERSON, he makes her yet another shitty character in his shitty comic. The multiple Sonichu recolors have to search for the mystical super special awesome Sonichu Pokeball Crystals, which are [[Lie|OMG SO NOT THE CHAOS EMERALDS OR THE DRAGONBALLS OR ANYTHING]]. For some reason black person and a green Sonichu show up; the green Sonichu is revealed to be [[Moonspeak|Redlnahc Notsew Naitsirhc Ha-Taque]] or something and also has a thing for [[BDSM]]. Of course, Chris-chan sucks dick, so he almost gets defeated, but Bionic the Hedgehog (surprisingly, not a Sonichu, but almost as bad) saves his sorry ass.{{clear}}

===Issue #7===
[[Image:SonichuIssue7.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sonichu #7: Lost in Space-Time]]
Chris-chan and some of his recolors travel back in time to get one of the Sonichu Pokeball Crystals. For some reason, Chris-chan threw a shitty ''Family Guy''-esque episode in there, [[Irony|featuring a version of himself that looks like Peter]]. He then proceeds to get completely lost in time, THANK GOD. Meanwhile, everyone Chris hates teams up to try and [[rape]] him. {{clear}}

===Issue #8===
[[Image:SonichuIssue8.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sonichu #8: Beach Sex]]
This issue was apparently created to retaliate against [[4chan]] for making Chris look like the [[idiot]] he is. Rosechu and Sonichu have [[DO NOT WANT|gratuitous amounts of sex]] before setting off to try and convince "[[4chan|4-cent-garbage.com"]] (run by the [[moot|Devil himself]]) to take down pictures revealing Rosechu's true nature as a [[dickgirl]]. After the [[moot|owner]] throws a pickle at Rosechu, she [[RAGE|UNLEASHES THE FUCKING FURY]] and crushes his head with her [[WTF|VAGINA]]. Also contains Chris's personal stash of [[furry]] [[yiff]] porn.
Meanwhile, Chris-chan is still trapped in a [[Time Cube|swirling time vortex]], so instead of rescuing him, [[LOL|his legion of recolors decides to go to the beach]]. Some whore named [[Mary Sue|Silvana]] shows up and fucks Blachu...ahem, "[[Not racist|Blake]]", while pretending to be Bubbles. Meanwhile, Bubbles goes to search for the last Pokeball Crystal thing then comes back and almost [[Lesbian|fucks]] Silvana, who's pretending to be Blake, but ends up pwning her instead. {{clear}}

===Issue #9===
[[Image:SonichuIssue9.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Sonichu #9: Twelve Angry Losers]]
All of CWC's characters who haven't been romantically partnered yet [[fail|have to take a dating class]] because apparently they do not know [[How Do I Shot Web?|how to shot semen]]. Chris still fails to get a girlfriend, so he takes the class too; only [[Raptor Jesus|Divine Intervention]] is able to hook him up with a [[troll|girl]] named Ivy. After more (albeit implied) [[Yiffing|creepy furry sex]], Rosechu [[pantyshots]], and Sonichu whining about [[Truth|people who think Chris is gay]], Mary Lee Walsh tries to fuck up CWCville again... again. She sends a bunch of ripped-off robots from Transformers to kill them all. Chris-chan's merry band of retards and recolors have to stop fucking each other in the ass for once and defeat Mary Lee Walsh/Slaweel Ryam/whatever the hell her name is now with the power of [[Rape|LOEV]][[Stupid|!!!!1!!]] [[The Real Chris Chan]] eventually shows up in Sonichu form. He promptly gets his ass kicked and Sonichu rescues Rosechu. The multicolored retards eventually [[fail|win]] out and peace returns to CWCville once more. In the epilogue, Chris finally gets back from the time void he's been trapped in for... what, three issues? and promises not to feature himself in his own comics anymore. [[No|We can trust that he'll keep his word.]] 
 Also, Sonichu and Rosechu apparently [[Sex|got married]] and spawned three [[fugly|cute]] Sonichu babies. [[An Hero|Please, make it stop.]]{{clear}}
===Issue #10===
[[Image:SonichuIssue10.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Sonichu #10: This Time It's Creepier!]]
As expected, Chris is back for yet another issue despite his promise that the comic would focus only on his retarded creations. He finally escapes from the time warp.... again, and reveals that he traveled to the future and [[Sex|got it on]] with some chick named [[WTF|Lovely Weather]].  Chris, in an astounding show of [[Stupid|scientific knowledge]] and [[Offensive|political correctness]], has singlehandedly isolated the gene that makes people gay and plans to put a vaccine in the water supply to make everyone ''not'' gay. He goes to get his stuff out of storage, but his storage unit (hosted by Tripod) has been infested with bugs that look like naked women with green hair and huge tits. You can't make this shit up. Anyway, having retrieved all his crap, Chris goes and dismantles 4chan through the power of RAWK, then turns his arch-nemesis Redna... Naitsi... whateverthefuck straight with some sort of straight vaccine. With the world on the path to being completely straight once and for all,  Chris expresses his desire to fuck [[Family Guy|Meg Griffith]], who's actually the comic's resident [[dickgirl]], Silvana, in disguise. 

Having defeated the trolls for now, Chris and Sonichu go off to right more wrongs. Unfortunately, they don't destroy the comic to this end, but instead power up a la [[OVER 9000]]. They save Chris's sister-clone-thing, rescue the emo kid's girlfriend from being asleep forever, destroys teh [[Xbox|HEXBAWKS]] forevar, get some other Sonichu to worship Chris (not like they already don't), save homeless Rosechu recolors and old Rastafarians, free the Jerkops, and send Slaweel Ryam to jail for lyfe. Chris kills off one of his stolen character to dodge guilt and blames it on someone else. The "killers" get sentenced to death and are brutally slashed, stabbed and shot to death by Chris and his Sonichu. [[No one cares]]. 
{{clear}}

===Issue #11===
[[Image:SonichuIssue11.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Sonichu #11: what]]
Finally, Chris finished Issue 11.  At least, so we think.  The comic features an art style of even lower quality, but it still resemble's Chris', so it could have just been him being lazy.  <s>Considering that the WikiSysop of CWCipedia uploaded the pages, this is likely.</s> He got trolled by his own Sysop.  It features the same retarded typos, same stupid, rambling dialogue, and the same "as you can see here" life lesson attempts.  However, the issue's events may surprise some people.

It starts with Sonichu and Rosechu eating breakfast while talking about how much they enjoyed their midnight sex (right in front of their children).  When they ask what a "seven-inch lightning rod" is, Sonichu says that he'll show them.  Chris then has a rant on why Sonichu isn't an incestuous, bisexual pedophile for this.  Magi-chan calls Sonichu, saying that Slaweel captured Bubbles and Angelica and has them trapped in a shopping mall.  Chris, Wild, Magi-chan, and the CWCville Power Rangers arrive on scene.  Meanwhile, Reginald shows his penis to Sonichu's kids, and Rosechu yells at him for it.  Apparently, Angelica stopped constantly banging Reginald.  Rosechu immediately forgives him, and then makes him leave.  Reginald develops lust for Rosechu.  Chris makes a rant about how Rosechu is virutous for not fucking with Reginald.  Switch back to Sonichu, having defeated the jerkops.  Slaweel throws pickles at him, but Sonichu pimp slaps her, which somehow kills her.  However, Wild and Sonichu see the Wal-Mart explode.  Magi-chan informs them that Angelica and Bubbles died in the explosion.  This is where Chris creating this becomes doubtful.  Switch to Sandy, who jaywalks while listening to music, and gets run over by a driver who's texting and driving.  Wild learns that she died immediately.  Depressed over the death of his daughter, only a month after his wife died, Wild tried to get the driver locked up forever.  He can't, however, as Sandy was jaywalking.  Wild, fed up with the city's shitty judicial system, commits suicide.  Meanwhile, the lesbian Spanish nanny calls Sonichu, telling him that all of his kids drank some drain cleaner.  Only Cera survived, and she has permanent brain damage.  The cost for her medical care is ridiculously high, upsetting Sonichu.  Rosechu suggests getting Chris to help, but Sonichu says that he's too busy with video games and "the Wallflower" (Chris' "girlfriend" that left him IRL a month or two ago).  We learn that Chris has all but disappeared from society, holed u in his house.  Sonichu turns to drinking, and has sexual fantasies about Angelica.  Rosechu smothers Cera with a pillow, and pretends that she stopped breathing by herself.  Sonichu divorces her anyway, and Rosechu reveals that she always hated being married to him.  Chris makes a final rant about careless actions and unsafe sex, before revealing that Issue 12 will be a reboot.  The events of this comic leave Punchy, Blake, the Transformer clones, two of the CWCville Power Rangers, Magi-chan, Chris, the lesbo Spanish nanny, and pretty much every character based from IRL people (except Slaweel Ryam) still living.

After writing the issue, Chris removed it due to its controversial subject matter and general unpopularity with the fans. The good folks at ED, however, have captured all the dramatic goodness. '''BEWARE: SOME OF THESE IMAGES MAY PROVE SHOCKING TO FANS OF SONICHU!!!!1!!!1!'''

===Issue #12===
[[Image:SonichuIssue12.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Sonichu #12]]
Apparently will be a reboot for the series.
{{clear}}

===TL;DR===
Sonichu [[fails]], Blachu is a black person, everyone else is a copy/pasted [[recoloring|recolor]], and Chris is never, EVER going to get any.

==Fan Comics==
What's this? Fan comics? Holy shit. 

Well children, the [[fact|facts]] of [[life]] are simple. Chris-Chan, in all his [[autistic]] man-child glory, has actually managed to [[shit|create]] something that inspired people. And what is it that [[you|you've]] done with your life? Nothing. That's why you're all [[faggot|faggots]] and why we should make our own comic and shit in his mouth
===Sonichu Remade===
[[Last Thursday|Recently]], a [[Tartlet]] by the name of  [http://gabmonteiro9389.deviantart.com/ ~gabmonteiro9389] decided to remake the [[crap|classic]] Sonichu Comics. Although the [[quality]] of the remake is clearly superior to the original, it's still about [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|Sonichu]], so it still [[Fellatio|sucks balls]].

===Sonichu Finale===
[http://sonichufinale.canalblog.com/ Sonichu Finale] (by a Mr. Harry [[dick|D]]) explores life in CWCville, but with a twist: it's <s>good</s>shit. The art is entertaining, the dialog is pretty good, and the premise isn't that bad but since it's still about Sonichu, it sucks the living shit out of its own asshole. Certainly <s>much more interesting and refreshing than</s> the usual crap that Charlottesville spawns. Issue 1 is below, follow the [http://sonichufinale.canalblog.com link] for more.

==Sonichu: [[The Game]]==
[[Image:CWCnewblog.jpg|right|thumb|"When Do You Want Nintendo and SEGA to Talk to Me to EVOLVE Sonichu and Rosechu more Realistically?"]]

[[Image:Chrissychan.png|left|thumb|75px|"So who wants to '[[Shawn Johnson|make my taco pop]]' first?"]]

[[Image:Rinachansonichu.jpg|right|thumb|On [[facebook]], Sonichu gets fans from across the board! Including [[Rina-chan|ARASUKA]].]]
[[File:Lulzwtf.png|thumb|right|Gotta go fast Sonichu]]
After Chris' website was dead for a year, he posted a new entry on August 17th, 2008, [[unrealistic expectations|calling for all the ''Sonichu'' fans to storm Nintendo and Sega with requests that his character be given official merchandise]]. He also announced the launch of a new blog dedicated to ''Sonichu: The Game'', whose content consisted mainly of [[shitty art|"fan art"]] and a few of his own pictures accompanying Sakurai-like updates to the game's progression.

{{quote|And I HAVE the idea for the Video Game for myself, if I can swing that with SEGA as well, an epic tale of my [[Boring|tragic]] Adult Life straight from my [[emo|tortured heart and soul.]] I will bring the [[PROFIT!|pain]] to the Jerkops, I will [[fuck|kick]] Mary Lee Walsh into her [[pussy|cauldron]] to [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|burn]], as well as the other villains. And I will have support from my [[furfags|Electric-Hedgehogs,]] [[Whore|my mother]] and father, my Closest [[Imaginary Friend|Gal-Pals]]|Chris, on his upcoming game.}}

On September 5th, 2008, the official ''Sonichu'' game blog revealed itself to be a [[troll]]. In a post claiming that SEGA and Nintendo had slapped "production" with a [[Banhammer|cease and desist order]], the resident blogger offered his redesigns of Sonichu and Rosechu; with a member of the upper class and a member of the Village People impersonating anteater/eel hybrids respectively.

He also stated that the game would be only on Gamecube and PS2, but NEVAR on Xbawks. Considering he owns and still plays an Xbox, this makes him an Xbox-HUEG hypocrite.

{{quote|He certainly has a point that we should encourage [[Feminazis|women's rights...to bear arms]]! It is advisable to keep this man a great distance from the nearest vagina.Do not be so down, for there is some good news too. You see, JKProductions has acquired the trademark for Sonichu, making him our official property! Christian Weston Chandler's "Sonichu" comics, should henceforth be recognized as an, *ahem*, poorly done fan-comic (laughs.)|JK Productions, being lulzy.}}

An archive of the site can be seen [http://www.sendspace.com/file/zz085p here].

===Shigeru Miyamoto Responds===

[[Image:ShigerumiyamotoEmail.jpg|thumb|right|Shigeru Miyamoto: "Chris, Your idea sucks!"]]

[[Image:Cwcshitgb.jpg|thumb|right|Another troll pretending to be [[Metal Gear Solid|Hideo Kojima]], someone Chris probably hasn't heard of.]]

After countless obsessive e-mails to Nintendo, a clever troll decided to impersonate [[Azn|Shigeru Miyamoto]], thus cementing the sheer impossibility of any ''Sonichu'' merchandise ever existing ever in. 

{{quote|The Big Brain behind Super Mario, Zelda and other Popular Nintendo characters and games, Shigeru Miyamoto, sent me an e-mail with his response to the Sonichu Game Project. [[Facepalm|He says Nay, but I bet's he could be holding out on us, or something.]] So, I say this unto you, my loyal fans, [[unrealistic expectations|continue with the e-mails]] and [[wut|Forum Talks]] with Nintendo and SEGA of America or Japan. They are missing out on a [[Failure|REAL Profitable thing]] they can [[USI|work with me on and cash in handsomely.]] I sent a detailed reply, but it came back to me in a "[[Lunix|Mailer Daemon]]" message, so I've taken the liberty of printing a copy of the original message, and a copy of my reply that I will send to Nintendo of America for them to transfer to Mr. Miyamoto himself. Give them time and messages.|Chris-chan, using stupid logic.}}

However, Chris still fails to realize that nobody wants to play a shitty game with a shitty [[Mary Sue]] character. He is still [[Loser|trying to get the game made]].
He also likes men with hairy bums.
===Round Two===
4chan's [[/v/]] board was greeted by a thread made by a person using the alias called Andrew [[Pokemon|Crogonk]] (known as [[Pickbothmanlol]]) on July 16, 2010 with a site called [http://www.sonichugame.webs.com sonichugame.webs.com]. What other than another round of [[win|trolling Chris with a game based on Sonichu]], except the only differences are that it will be released for [[Linux]] (free?) and [[PS3]] and the trolls are calling their self Iceman Productions. On August 8, 2010 a e-mail was sent back to PBML saying that the idea was rejected due to being a part of the faggotry according to him that is Encyclopedia Dramatica.
