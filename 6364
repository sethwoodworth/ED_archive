'''[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/181593/ Peter Chimaera]''' is quite possibly the most important author of the modern era, with a career spanning over five years and his works being likened to those of [[Dick|Dickens]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Squirrelking]] and [[An hero|Hemingway]]. His writing is definitely in the [[Chasethehedgehog|top ten percent]] of [[Fanfiction#FanFiction.net|Fanfiction.net's]] userbase and has received much critical acclaim!

{{spoiler|[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/667106/1/DIGIMON_SAVEZ_THE_WROLD_1111 Digimon savez the wrold]}}
Boldly beginning his career with a two-parter, Chimaera explores societal decay through the medium of a nameless [[Digimon]]. The narrative becomes a commentary on the battle between ''scintist's'' and [[religion]], showing that, when ''scince'' is left to run rampant, roads are ''destoryd'' and people become trapped on their own personal islands, the very islands they were trapped on! Islands of delusion and self-destruction.

{{spoiler|[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/849804/1/DIGIMON_2_RETURN_OF_DIGIMON In chapter 2, the evil Digimon is not reely dead. It swa a trick].}}
With his finger on the pulse of modern culture, Chimaera integrates the popular [[All Your Base]] [[meme]] into the synopsis of this story. Truly his brevity of wit is unmatched! In the shocking conclusion to ''DIGIMON SAVEZ THE WROLD!!1111'', Chimaera shows a much more refined writing style that is sure to touch every emotion one is capable of feeling, exploring trickery and subterfuge as well as his trademark epic battles. The dedication at the end of the story brought a tear to this reviewer's eye as it proved that the writing truly came from Chimaera's heart.

This work was particularly controversial for its product placement--namely, the start of chapter two, where the mysterious Digimon is eating Cap'n Crunch.

{{cs2|DigimonSaves3|''DIGIMON 3: PREDATOR VS DIGIMON''|
{{spoiler|[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5413251/1/Digimon_3_Predator_Vs_Digimon DIGIMON IS A NEW DIGIMON BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ACTUAL DIGIMON THAT IS CALLED DIGIMON HE IS A NEW ONE THAT HE INVENTED].}}
The story starts off with ''Preadator'' who is about to ''crush''! He crushed into a highway while Digimon was being driven to the island (presumably the same one from '''DIGIMON SAVEZ THE WROLD!!1111''')in his limo. Digimon tries to help a kid ''rapped'' under a car but is not strong enough. Suddenly, the alien ship was '''allxploded''' and everyone fell down from the ''tremandoul blapst wave''! The next day ''Gigimon'' woke up and got ready for work, and figured that the post man was knocking at his door. But opening the door showed '''Krlrkak''', brother of Preadator! After fighting, Digimon and Krlrkak went to the FBI (with a ''TIMEFUL KICK TO THE VERY DOOR'') to see they were the villains! The police take down the FBI and Krlrkak gives Digimon a spear and the cops come over for dinner at the end.

We're given a possible look at a larger, looming crisis due to Chimaera's almost offhanded mention that Officer Victorix was not able to attend the dinner. With Chimaera's almost godlike control over dramatic storytelling, readers may very well hear more of Officer Victorix's mysterious work that kept him from such an important dinner. 

This story takes a different perspective on the FBI than his previous work, ''Desert Bus Ride''. In ''Desert Bus Ride,'' one of our main protagonists is Kyle Roberts, an undercover FBI agent, portrayed so positively that many consider the story to be Chimaera's tribute to the service of the FBI. In ''Digimon 3'', the FBI is a decidedly darker organization, having caused the crash of Krlrkak's brother ''because of fbi experiments''. The new take on the Bureau is undoubtedly a sign of Chimaera's dark but pragmatic view that no person or group is ever a constant force of good in the world. 

Digimon 3 has been met wait approval, though some say it is [[Bullshit|not as good as the others]].

{{cs2|DOOMRoE|''DOOM: Repercussions of Evil''|
{{spoiler|John is teh demonz!!}}
[[image:JonArbuckleWasAZombie.jpg|frameless|right]]
Chimaera's most well known piece. ''DOOM: Repercussions of Evil'' is a frightening look at what happens when demons get into the base. On a superficial level, the novella follows the protagonist, John Stalvern, in his battle against the forces of hell invading the UAC. But on a deeper level it explores wide-ranging themes from man vs. nature to man vs. the supernatural...even man vs. himself, through a riveting coming-of-age tale wherein John Stalvern is forced to confront a chilling metaphor of fear of being integrated into the nameless, faceless hordes of the business world. Don't miss the shocking twist that places ''DOOM: Repercussions of Evil'' in a league with the greatest psychological thrillers in literary history. '''(HINT: PAY ATTENTION TO THE PART WHERE THE RADIO TELLS JOHN HE IS THE DEMONS.)'''

{{cs2|Gundam:WFB|''Gundam Wing Final Battle''|
{{spoiler|[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1605857/1/Gundam_Wing_Final_Battle ALL THE PENGUINS DIE]}}
''[[Gundam Wing]] Final Battle'' delves into the more human aspects of the characters we know and love from the ''Gundam Wing'' universe, showing Heero's dissatisfaction with his lunch. Heero's problems become overwhelming and he flies to the north pole to [[emo|get away from the world]]. But his solitude is interrupted by [[sex|Zechs]] who destroys not only the north pole, but all of the penguins too! Chimaera delves to new depths of human depravity in his graphic depiction of the penguins' demise. The story ends on a real cliffhanger. Hopefully, Peter will continue his saga.

{{cs2|Batman:NF|''BATMAN: NEMESIS FIGHT''|
{{spoiler|CATWOMAN IS ALYAWS EVIL.}}
A [[Batman]] tale to rival ''The Dark Knight Returns'', Peter Chimaera skilfully shows how far the Dark Knight can be pushed by his ''evli nemisis''. When the Joker kills Alfred, Bruce Wayne is driven so far over the edge, he shoots ''a big fireball like on [[Dragonball Z]]''. This beautifully-crafted story also shows the dangers of lust, as a lovemaking session between Batman and Catwoman ends with her revealing she is ''alyaws evil'' before almost murdering him. Now a motion picture on [[YouTube]].

{{cs2|MatrixRet|''The [[Matrix]] Return''|
{{spoiler|[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3323569/1/The_Matrix_Return Neo doesn't really die].}}
While the synopsis for this story simply states that ''Neo, Moerpheus , and Trinity have fo fight'', much more than just fighting is explored! The machines have created a new matrix where the heroes' ''cannot their powers.'' Highlights include Morpheus' ''[[pegging|swording]] of his [[asshole|katana]] at [[massive damage|great attack]]'' and the biblical resurrection of Neo ''because of mediskel equipmont.'' The final paragraph will imbue the reader with ''strewngth'' and will make them ''cheered with new hope'' with the rest of Neo's crew! A interpreted version of the literary masterpiece has been renditioned by some guy on [[YouTube]].

Richter Belmont is forced to battle Darcula's evil forces to save his sick son. Richter's heroism allows him to trick Darcula and at the end of the final battle ''Darcula's head rolled down teh forest hill into the swamp by Tranvlsania Desert and his body turn to dust.'' In the final shocking twist, Richter returns home to find his son ''dead of the skick''. In true heroic fashion, Richter decides to have another child to carry on his legacy!

{{cs2|DMC:TCoTD|''DEVIL MAY CRY: THe CRYING OF THE DEMON''|
{{spoiler|[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682055/1/DEVIL_MAY_CRY_THe_CRYING_OF_THE_DEMON Karrven was alsready mudredicd becuse she was un dead ghost spirit of demon working for the great daman mastar Powerloth].}}

Arguably Peter Chimaera's greatest masterpiece of all time, this tale of adventure, horror, and danger always leaves readers on the edge of their seats. The hero, Dante, lived in a ''castal of darkness'', which is symbolic for how man must become a part of something larger than himself. Dante must fight to win triumphs over evils. You can see the Freudian symbolism in the way Dante gets emotional when his ''faether's'' sword broke. The action is nonstop, from Karrven ''explosioning a fire'' at Dante and Dante ''cracking an awesome lightning'' back at her with his ''pistals'', to Dante's use of ''gun attack'' to blood the face off of Simonn Belmont (''who was turns more evil by Darcula''). In the end, we all learn the important lesson that we must all do our ''deuty'', no matter how bads we feel about it.

{{cs2|Halo:BCWMC|''Black Crisis With Master Chief''|
{{spoiler|[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3324886/1/Black_Crisis_With_Master_Chief MASTER CHIEF SAVES THE WORLD]!!}}
In this epic tale of Master Chief's exploits beyond what is portrayed in ''[[Halo]]'', Master Chief faces his most powerful foe yet; a black hole! A black hole so powerful that ''rockets do nothing to it.'' Thankfully Master Chief is saved from certain doom by a timely teleport and everyone can relax back at the base at the end of the day.

To the surprise of the literary community, the story was ''not'' about the Master Chief's role in combating the other [[black]] [[Truth|problem]]. Thankfully, Chimaera's masterful writing more than made up for this initial reader community.

{{cs2|DBR1:ARSaFL|''Desert Bus Ride 1: A Romance Story and For Ladies''|
{{spoiler|[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3820733/1/Desert_Bus_Ride_1_A_Romance_Story_and_for_Ladies MARGARET'S BOYFRIEND AM HIT BY BULLETS].}}
In this one, Peter expands his audiences to ladies. Chimaera truly branches out into new audiences with this work. While its source is obscure, he truly captures the feel of the ''Desert Bus'' video game. It centers around the people on a bus ride to Las Vegas, including Bob Orlando, the driver, Kyle Roberts, an FBI agent incognito, and Margaret, a woman hoping to go see her boyfriend. Many perils are met along the way, such as a skunk who is almost ran over. When they get there, the group finds Margaret's boyfriend is shot, ''all because terrorists''! The ambiguous ending seems to suggest something happened to the brave Kyle Roberts, and indeed the story is dedicated to the FBI. Despite it ending, there seems to be ample room for a sequel.

{{cs2|Quarter:HtD|''QuarterLife: Halfway to Destruction''|
{{spoiler|[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3934572/1/QuarterLife_Halfway_to_Destruction NO, NOT ALL OF DALLAS]!}}
In this epic narration of the exploits of [[Half-Life|Gordon Freeman]], Chimaera takes on one of gaming's greatest heroes. He begins with a touching encounter with a co-worker, Jimmy, whose characterization is superb, among the best of the 20th and 21st centuries. Before this blossoming friendship can turn into something [[buttsecks|more]], a vicious headcrab attack, only averted due to Freeman's skill with the claymore, means that the isotope is stolen! This is no ordinary isotope, however; ''it is so vollatile that it does not have a half-life but quarter-life so [they] must observe with hasty.'' A rescue attempt leads to the bad guy from the game throwing the isotope into the alien scene, causing teh room to become vaporize. In the panic that ensues, Freeman's lover, Jimmy, is blowed to smitheroons. Using his MIT-learnt stoicism, however, Freeman overcomes these odds; [[Portal|by thinking with portals]], he pushes the base away, and thus saves Dallas. Or does he? Chimaera's mastery of the cliffhanger ending leaves us all wanting more.

Many have regarded his decision to write a ''Half-Life'' fanfiction as direct competition with Squirrelking, who reinvented the genre in 2006 with ''Half life Full Life Consequences''. Neither of the legendary ''autors'' has been available to comment on the issue. 

'''''Note''': [[Unfunnypedia]] has claimed to have inspired Quarterlife. This is blatantly untrue, since the author clearly states in the first paragraph that it was in fact Uncycylopidia, an online version of wikiped that inspired it.''

This masterpiece has already inspired a 3D feature film, seen below:

<center>{{frame|<youtube>fOvglodUIcA</youtube>|color=#EE2C2C}}</center>
''QuarterLife: Halfway to Destruction'' was an critical success. It is said that writing of this epic is already happening and will deal with Gordan Freeman's fall into darkness after the loss of Jim.

==Critical Acclaim for DOOM: Repercussions of Evil==
Here, one can view, firstly the masterpiece itelf, then it's cinematic adaptationa and after, some of the adaptations of Mr. Chimaera's works:

<div style="height:100px; overflow:scroll; border: 5px solid #FF0000; padding: 3px; background: #FFFFFF; vertical-align: top; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; margin-bottom: 3px;">
DOOM: Repercussions of Evil

John Stalvern waited. The lights above him blinked and sparked out of the air. There were demons in the base. He didn't see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Cernel Joson were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.<br>John was a space marine for fourteen years. When he was young he watched the spaceships and he said to dad "I want to be on the ships daddy."<br>Dad said "No! You will BE KILL BY DEMONS"<br>There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the space station base of the UAC he knew there were demons.
"This is Joson" the radio crackered. "You must fight the demons!"<br>So John gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall.<br>"HE GOING TO KILL US" said the demons<br>"I will shoot at him" said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. John plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.<br>"No! I must kill the demons" he shouted<br>The radio said "No, John. You are the demons"<br>And then John was a zombie.

|Wow... just wow... this story.. where to begin... let's just say [[I came|I "plasmaed" my shorts]] after reading it...|Insomniac3

|This is one of the funniest things I've ever read! Chimaera has managed to do things which no Doom fan has ever done before|Stupid Bunny

|Genius! Pure genius! This is a cautionary tale that stresses the negative consequences of joining the armed forces. It also explores a Freudian struggle between a man and his father. Furthermore, I believe this story truly stresses that black-and-white thinking is detrimental to humankind, as you can neither say that John is a good person nor that the demons are truly evil Eventually, we learn that John's amplified sense of masculinity leads to his downfall.|Cheesecrimp

|Possibly the best work I've seen on this website. If anything, ''Doom'' should be considered a fan adaptation of ''this'' story. 
From a psychological perspective, John Stalvern is torn by his desires to join the UAC Marine Corp and still honor his father's warnings of being kill by demons. A standards reading of this masterpiece shows that John's fanaticism in fulfilling his goals ultimately leads to an inability to control his own lust for the demon's blood, literally transforming him into that which he loathes so powerfully.<br>But, an alternative theory would give ''Repercussions of Evil'' a twist that puts ''The Sixth Sense'' to shame: there are no demons. It is stated that John could not see the demons, but had been expecting them for years. It is possible that his own steadily growing paranoia, coupled with the doubt planted in his mind following his father's blunt rebuke of his innocent desire to be on the ships led to a complete breakdown of John's ability to differentiate between reality and the dark fears of his mind. <br>The result is quite simple: the demons are at best entirely fictional, as is the entire scenario, with John being trapped in some sort of comatose state brought on by the shattering of his fragile mind, or, worse, that the demons are in fact ''fellow humans''. The demons he encounters after breaking the wall are clearly afraid of him, a characteristic decidedly unbecoming of a demon, and only the supposed 'Cyberdemon' is willing to fight back by firing the rocket missiles. <br>John may very have, in his mentally shattered state, blown a hole in the wall to the mess hall, opening fire with his palsma rifle on his unarmed Marine comrades, seen in his mind to be demons in his broken reality. The Cyberdemon, being the only one capable of fighting back against him, may be a lone armed guard or (if the men ''were'' armed) the first Marine who tried to fight off the delusional Stalvern. Eventually, following the slaughter of dozens of his unarmed comrades and John becoming trapped under the wreckage of the ceiling, brought down by the devastation of John's palsma rifle and the counterattack of 'Cyberdemon'. Because nothing short of heavy ordinance would be able to bring down the ceiling of a reinforced military space station, it may be that this is simply John's interpretation of being either wounded, restrained, or similarly incapacitated. The final revelation that ''he is the demons'' can be viewed as his damage mind's attempt to bestow the horrible reality on him, telling him that he is in fact as destructive as the beasts he wished to fight.|What a twist!

|This is the worst thing I ever read. [[Lulz|You can't even spell. The whole story id idiotic]]. Give up.|johnson

|Dude. How old are you? [[Lie|This is the worst piece of crap I've ever read]]. My IQ dropped about six points for reading it. [[Butthurt|And all you people extolling him as a sage and crier of society's faults, what the f* is wrong with you]]? [[Habeeb it|Are you KIDDING me?]] [[Bullshit|This isn't literature,]] it's someone letting their kid access a word processor and the internet when this kid should be taught how to type and/or spell first. You people are morons. Jew can't believe people like [[God|"Peter Chimaera"]] dare to call yourselves writers.|[[Jealous|An]] [[Nigra|illiterate]]

|Doom: Repercussions of Evil is a multi-layered, thoughtful piece of prose in which the protagonist is wrestling with the demons of his present and how they have manifested from his troubled past. We find that John Stalvern has not been able to let go of the painful relationship between himself and his father and subsequently is haunted by recollections of the warnings and wisdom he rejected from the man with whom he shared a broken love.<br>Further, we find suggestions of mental illness in the episode of psychosis we witness, brought on by the flickering of the ceiling lights which trigger his inner torment and tap into the pain of his past, causing a transformation even John does not yet realise has occurred. The severe paranoia John exhibits is clearly ignored by his fellow marines, shown by the disregard Cernal Joson displays regarding John's warning of demons inhabiting the base. This action is likely one of many which contributes to the psychotic release and externalisation of John's repressed demons.<br>In this state of mental delusion, John's imagination creates a Joson counterpart who is fully aware of the demons and is willing to provide communications support to John in his quest, so that John feels he is not alone as the sole witness to his despair.<br>John's certainty of victory over his demons is exhibited by their fearful cry of imminent destruction but the cyberdemon becomes the Jungian archetype of John's strongest, darkest Shadow self who is the only one willing to resist against John's attempts at emotional exorcism.<br>Caught in an epic struggle between the personification of his pain and the John-self who struggles for inner healing, John's shattered mentality is unable to ascertain which is stronger and the ceiling collapses to create a stalemate in which he does not have to endure the stress of self-reparation.<br>It is with the final twist of events in which we find Cernal Joson, the voice of John's higher self of distanced wisdom is the messenger to reveal John's true nature unto himself. The demons he externalised are indeed a creation of his own mental deterioration and it is faced with this fact that he reaches a turning point in his struggle for completeness - either he will either overcome the restrictive mechanism of self-preservation to become free, or he will collapse from the frustration of his inability to forgive the father he rejected so long ago.<br>With the final revelation, we discover that John is simply not strong enough to individualise and become the man he laments the loss of. In the twisted reality of John's darkest insanity, he himself is transformed into a demonic being, the undead nature of his zombie form depicting the never-ending torment he has given in to suffer for the remainder of his mortal existence.|A literary critic weighs in with a psychoanalysis of the tale.
