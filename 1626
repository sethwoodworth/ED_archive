'''Clippit''' is a [[meme]] on [[4chan]] which [[everyone]] seems to know, but which [[nobody gives a fuck|no one notices]]. Also known as the '''Office Assistant''', Clippit is a small paperclip that was originally to be found in [[Microsoft]]'s Office packages, although he was dropped from their software [[at least 100]] years ago because people got pissed off with his antics.

The idea of the meme is that when offering advice in Microsoft Office, Clippit would offer some solutions. /[[b]]/tards have been known, however, to allow variants to increase the [[lulz]] factor.

An [[exploitable]] version of this has been made. Go produce much [[lulz]].
