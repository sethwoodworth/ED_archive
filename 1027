[[Bledel]] is a [[greatestjournal]] user spawned from the depths of [[hell|italy]].

== Why, god, why? ==

[[Bledel]] is the biggest cunt on [[greatestjournal]]. When not rampaging through [[divierto]] with condescension and eyes like mini cds, she often lurks [[fuanon]] while sucking down fettuccine and living in denial that she is, indeed, a [[fatty]]. 

She often brags about her family and it's [[inbred|Italian]] ancestry and her alleged wealth. [[Bledel]] somehow managed to [[eat|suck]] a boyfriend into her life, presumably with the force of her black hole of a vagina. She likes to passive-aggressively attack people, often unprovoked.

[[Bledel]] likes to force her opinions on the unsuspecting [[hipsters|users]] of [[divierto]]. Common things for her to bitch about are Catholicism, abortion, relationships, and mtv. She believes she shouldn't be tested for STDs, but her partners should be. She has been known to piss off her own friends by being a complete bitch. The most recent event included [[e-psychiatrist|calling self injurers stupid and wanting to slap them]], which pissed off long time friends [[elite|hyz]], [[elite|impeace]], and [[anorexic|barrette]].

She is a garbage heap of [[unwarranted self importance]].

== The Bledel Memes ==

[[Bledel]] has managed to spawn [[meme|memes]] from her ravaging sandy cunt, mostly through her inability to laugh at herself and actually realize she's a fucking lard ass.

Italian - She originally posted a comment in [[divierto]] with a scrolling marquee that simply read "Italian." No one is really sure why, but hilarity ensued when [[anonymous]] got his dirty hands on it.

Eyes like mini CDs - [[Bledel]] believes she has "eyes like mini CDs." Apparently some kind of refuge from her pig face and triple chin supreme. Because, after all, we all know an ugly and fat individual's last plea for attraction is through their [[fat|pretty]] eyes.

Fettucine - [[Bledel]] likes fettuccine... Perversely.

Tiffany & Co. - Since [[Bledel]] is too fat to wear designer clothing, she picked the next best thing, [[ugly|designer]] jewelry.

{{Quote|I'd rather be ignorant than a cutter.|Bledel on her ignorance|color=black|size=300%}}

{{Quote|I didn't make fun of it but ok. I called people who do it for attention stupid and then I went on to say that it's harmful and pointless (which I think it is.) If people have a problem with me thinking that way then I don't really care. I'm not going to pretend like I feel so sorry for people who cut themselves and it's so sad because there are SO many other things they can do to help themselves, especially if they know what they're doing is wrong. If they don't do anything to help themselves then sorry, but I don't feel much sympathy for them.|Bledel on being a heartless cunt|color=black|size=300%}}

{{Quote|My partner should get tested for STDs, but not me.|Bledel on [[AIDS]]|color=black|size=300%}}

{{Quote|I hope whoever made the encyclopediadramatica page about me is proud. You've stooped to an all new low and it's absolutely disgusting to me. I would never do anything like that to someone. You posted my pictures and info about me on that piece of shit website and there's no way for me to get rid of it. I may have said some dumb things in the past, but this is far and beyond anything I've done. This is harassment and it makes me sick to my stomach to think that so many people would target me over things I've said. I don't dislike anyone on this website. Sure I've had falling outs with people, and a lot of people dislike me, but I don't hold grudges. I've never talked about anyone under anon or made fun of them. The people who are close to me know that I'm a good person and they know that I don't deserve this. I can put up with being called ugly and fat, but this is too much. I know it's stupid to be hurt by something that happened online, but I am. I've been hurt since last night, and I actually cried. That's not something I want to admit, but I did. My mom asked me what was wrong and I couldn't tell her because I know that it's pathetic. I know I'm probably going to regret doing this, but I had to get it out. I've spoken my mind and upset people with my opinions, but I don't deserve this. In short, I'm disgusted and hurt. I know this is "just the internet" and that website is "for the lulz" but this is not funny to me. If you think I deserve this or you think it's hilarious, then I'm glad you got a good laugh out of it. Bye.|Bledel on... Bledel.|color=black|size=300%}}  

{{Quote|...but I'd appreciate it if you could see it from my perspective.|Bledel on being a hypocrite|color=black|size=300%}}
