Once one of the lulziest shows ever to lulz the lulz on [[television]], it's now considered an [[old meme]] and generally shitty. True [[hXc]] fans claim the quality dropped off after the 9th season or when Matt Groening stole all of the non-shitty writers to work on ''[[Futurama]]'', leaving ''The Simpsons'' at the mercy of Mike Scully and Fox network executives dead set on whoring the show out long past the point of being profitable and franchise becomes a walking poster child for shows that should have been euthanized.
   
''The Simpsons'' was created by Russian descended communist Matt Groening for ''The Tracy Ullman Show'' back in late 1980's, after turning down a chance to animate his shitty ''Life In Hell'' when it became apparent that he would lose all rights to "[[luser|[his] life's work]]" if he took the deal. So he decided to create a new property that satirized the Midwestern Middle-Class Family: mom, dad, three kids, dog and cat stereotype we've all seen for years. Despite only being a minute long, ''The Simpsons'' was soon spun-off after ''The Tracy Ullman Show'' was canceled for sucking. The Simpsons would then go on to the FOX network which at the time was [[fail|the channel you still needed to put foil flags on your TV antenna to watch]].  

Little is it known, however, that Matt Groening actually built a time machine and traveled [[at least 100 years]] into the future. There, he saw a rerun of the [[fail|smash]] animated series ''[[Family Guy]]'', which means that it's ''The Simpsons'' that stole the idea, instead of the other way around.
 
==The Show==

[[Image:Squishee.gif|thumb|right|150px|Fruit Syrup and Yogurt Lassi, Yum!]]

The show used to make fun of a variety of subjects, from celebrities, politics, the media and everything in between. It also showed kids as screaming, backtalking hellions or emo jazz obsessed girls, which caused parental groups and George Bush's dad to boycott the show on account of the fact that it was a bad influence on children.

The show '''isn't funny at all''', and its fanbase above the age of 13 only like it because they were brought up with it, and when these, pubic hairs on society die, so will The Fucking Simpsons.

[[Image:TroyMacClure.gif|thumb|left|OMG! I was wrong, it was Earth, ALL ALONG!]]

It was also notable for celebrities (as if Jon Lovitz and Tracy Ullman were famous) to voice characters on the show that poked fun at the person [[IRL|in real life]]. Currently, celebrities just show up because it's expected of them, since the show's writers have lost any skill at crafting a plotline and now shove out [[retarded|illogical]] episodes that feature celebrities walking across the screen for no fucking reason, probably not even saying anything.  The show has been [[unfunny]] for a [[at least 100|number of years]] now, due to a severe lack of [[lulz]], since ironically enough, when they made Homer Simpson into "Jerk-Ass Homer", whatever the fuck that is (a term used to describe Homer's behavior since season nine), fans stopped laughing at Homer's antics and became very uncomfortable with them, as far as Homer becoming an unfunny sociopath/retard (the worst sin a writer can commit, since [[House|sociopaths are supposed to be lovable scamps that the viewers want to hug the evil out of, like Dexter or House)]].

==Online Reviews of the Simpson's Movie==

The following is a quote from Revered Dominick Malchiodi, after seeing ''The Simpons Movie' and coming back extremely offended. It was dug up from an [http://fstdt.com/fundies/random.aspx extremist psychopath Christian website], and goes to show how [http://christiananswers.net/spotlight/movies/2007/simpsonsmovie2007.html utterly retarded] some people can be if you brainwash them with enough bullshit. Clearly, Reverend Malchiodi was just confused after getting a raging erection at the sight of a little animated boy's penis, and had to leave to furiously masturbate in one of the bathroom stalls. 

<center>{{frame|[[Image:Hahowow.png|1000px||The movie is known for its subtly ironic meta-commentary.]]|color=blue}}</center>

It's just what happens when a person's religion is based on death, tyranny and mind control:

<div id="slidePagingContent1">

...My Bible says that there should not even be a HINT of sexual immorality in our lives. I went to the movies yesterday, and thought I would see this movie. The early scenes clearly show Homer Simpson grabbing the Bible and saying, 'You won't find any answers in here!' That was strike 1 one for me. And then the ensuing scene where Homer challenges Bart in a game of do or dare. His father dares him to ride his skateboard NAKED down to some area, and Bart complies. I walked out at the point where the movie focussed on Bart's genitalia. Actually showing a penis and testicles!!! The parents and the children in the theater roared in laughter! I left the theater sick to my stomach and felt that the Spirit of the Lord was grieved. I think that we have compromised too much in what we would allow into our homes and what we would pay to go see. I'm sorry if this strong but it is the truth. It's time to stop walking on egg shells and defend the Word of God! I don't care how I am judged by man. I answer to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. I pray that we would really search our hearts to see what the the Lord would want us to see and not see. Please, search your hearts and never compromise what the the word of God compells us to do. Thank you and God bless you all.

Ironically, Kyle, some teenager puts all these uppity [[Christians]] to bed:

I loved the movie. It was classic Simpson behavior. I just have one question. If the movie says PG-13, then why do all of these viewers (mainly the reviewers above) take their children to see it? If the movie says PG-13 then why are people taking their children. I've been reading these reviews and I saw a lot of: 'I was horrified that my children were exposed to this...etc.' It's PG-13 people that should be a warning not to take a 7 year old to it. Think. Not trying to be judgmental but...think, and follow the MPAA rating system.

My Ratings: Average / 4

==Bart Simpson, [[Scientologist]]==
[[File:Bartscientologist.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A bona fide, money-grabbing scientologist.]]

On January 28, 2009, Nancy Cartwright decided it would be a great idea to [[crime|infringe copyrights]] and endanger her contract with Fox by calling up Los Angeles locals to promote a Scientology eventby using the voice of Bart Simpson. She used colloquialisms like "man!", "ay! carumba!" and laughing retardedly. Nancy once donated her soul to $cientology. Nancy makes nearly $17,000,000/year from talking into a mic and doesn't want Xenu to take her vocal chords. [[South Park|It happened to Isaac Hayes]]: It could happen to [[you]].

==Simpsons and Playboy==
[[Image:Margesimpson playboy.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The cover]]
[[Image:Marge-simpson-bed.jpg|thumb|right|160px|A little something for the ladies in the background.]]

As a bold move to attract a [[Shota|younger male audience]], and after three years of gut-wrenching subscriber losses, [[Old|Hugh Heffner]] decided that it was time to [[Lie|totally shift gears]] and appeal to the lonely nerd demographic. By obvious process of elimination, the [[Bill Nye|scientists]] at the Bunny Laboratories came to the conclusion that only one [[desperate]] damsel could put them back at the top: [[lol wut|Marge Simpson]].

Designed to target a core group of 18-24 year olds, the November issue of Playboy magazine features Marge Simpson as not only the covergirl but also as the centerfold. I would hate to be any of the playboy girls passed over by this blue-haired bitch who is not only one of the ugliest characters in the history of animated sitcoms, but also has a voice that could make Freddy Krueger's ears bleed and the cup size of a middle school girl. But, one question does remain: Does the [[pussy|carpet]] match the drapes? In a world where yellow skin the norm and protruding head spikes constitute as style, it honestly wouldn't be much of a surprise if they did.

What Playboy failed to notice is, there already exists a large quantity of [[Rule 34|Simpsons porn]], courtesy of [[Drawn Sex|Drawn-Sex.com]], for all of those out there who ''(For whatever reason)'' want to see Marge naked... [[Guro|While stabbing Homer in the ass with a pair of scissors]]. So don't shell out your hard-earned cash for a couple of professionally-drawn nudes of a [[I See What You Did There|yellow pussy]]: Just keep on coming back to [[ED]] for all your [[fapping]] needs!

==[[Redundant|LJ Faggotry]]==
Many [[LJ]] users think it's funny to quote characters, particularly the [[Elgorgo|Comic Book Guy]]. The character is a [[fat]] [[nerd]] who spends too much time on the [[Internets]] and probably writes [[fan fiction]]. In other words, he's basically every [[LJ]] user. He is also bitterly sarcastic and often says "BEST/WORST ____ EVER", which has become a popular [[catchphrase]] among [[LJ]] [[fags]]. 

Example:

 Prima: Hey did you see the preview for ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' yet?
 Segunda: Yeah.
 Prima: What did you think?
 Segunda: WORST. TRAILER. [[EVAR]].
