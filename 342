[[Image:Alex4488lol.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander, after spotting a sheep.]]

'''Alexander4488''' ([[Power word|Full name]]: Alexander [[Muslim|Jared]] [[Nazi|Hans]] [[Paki|Badr]]) is a retarded [[intellectual checkmate|smug]] [[Canadia|Canadian]] and wannabe filmmaker who creates [[pathetic]] [[video game reviewers|video game reviews]] with the clichéd [[Angry Video Game Nerd|"angry nerd"]] shtick in them on [[YouTube]]. He also visits the [[Shit|Vancouver Film School]], hoping to [[Unrealistic expectations|"become a better director and filmmaker"]] and promotes himself as "the greatest thing on YouTube [next to the Angry Video Game Nerd]", despite the fact that he is one of the worst [[Video game reviewers|reviewers]] of all time.  He is also a [[terrorist]], treating the video game reviewing community just like the twin towers.

But don't you dare insult or criticize him, or even [[Freedom of speech|post so much as a single negative comment on any one of his shitty videos]]! Alex [[paranoid|Googles his name on an hourly basis]], so he is the first to know if anything bad is written about him or his videos. If that is the case, he will track you down and [[Flame war|try to defend his good name]], while he [[Fascist|deletes comments on his own videos like a little bitch]]. Fortunately for trolls, he will literally respond to <i>ANYTHING</i> that even so much as makes fleeting reference to him, which thrusts the potential for [[lulz]] upwards.

[[Protip|Fun fact]]: [[Troll]] him once, and [[Attention whore|he will subscribe to you]], thinking it will somehow discourage you from continuing to take actions against him. So, if you want to get that [[USI|"5 Subscribers Special"]] out a little sooner, just leave a single derogatory comment on a single video of his, and watch your subscriber count increase by 1 as your inbox fills up.

'''His girlfriend(the dumb bitch)'''
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4AxprSktMk]
This is supposedly Alex's girlfriend.You can tell why he picked her given that they both have the intelligence of a piece of shit(and that's being kind). Her wisdom of games is greatly shown in the God of War 2 box art review. Yes I know exciting. Posting that she is a fat,ugly,stupid,whore or something else is guaranteed to generate lulz.
Also, remind him that that bitch should be in the kitchen.

{{quote|[[BAW|BAWWWWWWW]]|Summary of every video by Alexander4488}}

Just like every [[Video Game Reviewers|video game reviewer]] on YouTube, he was [[leech|"influenced"]] by the [[Angry Video Game Nerd]]'s videos. But his passion went a little too far: He claims that [[stalker|he has sent hand-written letters to James Rolfe]], and also created a [[not|TOTALLY FUNNY AND ORIGINAL]] video game reviewing series on YouTube by the name of the [[Epic Fail|Annoyed Gaming Geek]]. However, Alexander realized that the name was too similar to the AVGN's, and changed it -- his only smart decision so far -- to the '''Gay Douche'''.

The name changed, the fad remained: in his [[Shit|"reviews"]] -- which are actually more like rants -- the Gay Douche sits there and needlessly bitches about [[Shit no one cares about|small aspects of the game which really no one cares about]]. At the end, he invents new swear words (most preferably with [[gay|"ass"]]) and combines them to the point where they mean nothing anymore. There's even more: The Gay Douche also [[retro|rants about new games]] from old [[Mario|Nintendo]] or [[Sonic|Sega]] franchises -- up to the point where he trashes them because they offer new or different options and details.

To cut a long story short: Alexander4488's reviews are the love child of the [[AVGN]]'s swearing, the [[Irate Gamer]]'s stupidity and [[Spax3]]'s [[Retro|retrofaggotry]].

=== Theme Song ===

[[Image:Alexander4488 apraisal.jpg|center]]

Alex [[No life|re-uploads the same videos over and over again within minutes of each other with only minor edits]] because they fell below a score of 3 1/2 stars (as he's not yet realized that it is the work of trolls, downvoting just to fuck with him and deflate his massive ego). What he should revise is his abysmal theme song:

  He is the Game Dude.
  He is so rude.
  He is a gamer with a bad attitude.
  He plays the games that brought mankind to shame.
  They insult the brain because they are so lame.
  <br>
  Now listen up.
  Game Dude is his name.
  Spends most of his time playing shitty games.
  Some from the present.
  Some from the past.
  But rest assured, they all suck zebra's ass.
  Graphics so bad, they make you wanna puke.
  The music's so annoying, you'll quickly hit the mute.
  But who is this man? Who? Who?
  The one who plays them so you don't have to.
  <br>
  He is the Game Dude.
  He is so rude.
  He is a gamer with a bad attitude.
  He plays the games that brought mankind to shame.
  They insult the brain because they are so lame.
  <br>
  Stories are bland.
  They rip off Wonderland.
  Look at our dragonfly.
  Now he looks like a man.
  Our flying squirrel can't walk up the stairs.
  And why is our bear just a bunch of squares?
  A werewolf, our hedgehog became?
  Our bandicoot, himself he defamed.
  No one likes the puss.
  Our fox is now a wuss.
  Look at these games.
  What a fuck platypus.
  <br>
  He is the Game Dude.
  He is so rude.
  He is a gamer with a bad attitude.
  He plays the games that brought mankind to shame.
  They insult the brain because they are so lame.
  They insult the brain because they are so lame.

=== From AVGN Rip-Off to AVGN Stalker ===

Alex decided being "inspired" by the [[AVGN]] wasn't good enough so in a desperate attempt to become best buds with James, he sent him a load of [[Weeaboo]] shit in the vein hope that Mr. Rolfe would respond. Unfortunately James did reply which boosted Game Dude's ego to [[over 9000]], so now Mr. Badr thinks he and James are the best of friends. He has jumped off the deep end in terms of sanity and is now stalking the poor four-eyed twat.

=== The Irate Gamer's Opinion of Alexander4488 ===

[[File:TheChrisBoresTruth.jpg|center]]

=== The AVGN's Opinion of Alexander4488? ===

<video type="viddler" id="73d7a311" width="437" height="370" position="center"/>

At the ScrewAttack Gaming Convention 2010 on July 2nd, the AVGN gave a Q&A session with the attendees. During this, the inevitable question would arise; does the AVGN know who the Gay Douche is? At first his response was one of puzzlement, before giving an astounding NO. This led the AVGN to ask if the Game Dude is crazy. It is said that shortly after his response, the attendees could hear the cries of the Game Dude, as his whole world started to crumble around him. 

Given that the Game Dude had previously provided "evidence" of communications with AVGN, though letters and emails which were apparently sent by James himself, it leads us to believe that Alexander has schizophrenia. Poor Irate wannabe :(


<video type="viddler" id="ceb5ebb5" width="437" height="370" position="center"/>

In the AVGN's 'Nintendo Days Re-Revisited' episode, released on September 3rd 2010, James seems to make an almost subliminal hint about the Game Dude's habit of revising previous videos again and again and again. Since this video was made only months after first hearing about the Game Dude at SGC 2010, this is surely more than a mere coincidence. This is made even more believable by the fact that the AVGN knows about the Irate Gamer, so the chances of James knowing the Gay Dude are as high as the Game Dude's revision count.

Funnily enough, none of the AVGN's fans who have watched this episode have picked up on this. They were too busy jerking off with their Nintendo accessories and worshiping their almighty game reviewing God.



== [[Spam|Shameless Self Promotion]] ==
Alexander4488 is infamous for his, let's say, "unconventional" method of self promotion: [[Facepalm|Spamming every gaming website and YouTube video ever]]. A small sampling of his hilariously blunt attempts to boost his popularity (and [[butthurt]] responses) can be seen here.

=== Fanbase ===
{{quote|fuck you jaquan1254, alexnader4488 is﻿ awesome|{{youtube2|Kylebuschfan187|Kylebuschfan187}}|who isn't able to type Alexander's name correctly}}

As a result of his shameless self-promotion, he attracts the sort of scum that like the [[shit|wackiness]] of [[CAD|Ctrl+Alt+Delete]] or Irate Gamer's [[offended|unneeded swearing]]: [[13-year-old boys]], [[furries]], [[retard|retards]] and [[Ulrichthehedgehog|retarded 13-year-old furries]]. Like every [[fanboy]], they come to defend the person that - in their eyes - is the [[Lie|greatest and funniest video game reviewer of all time]], not realizing how much their [[God|idol]] sucks.

The reason why most of Alexander's fans are [[13-year-old boys|under the age of 16]] is that sooner or later they'll have to realize that Alexander's style of reviewing is just a [[ripoff|carbon copy]] of the [[AVGN]]'s style. Thus, they decide to leave the "fann comunity" and prefer to flame Irate Gamer's videos as AVGN Nazis.

== Initial Trolling ==

<video type="vimeo" id="11700634" width="425" height="480" position="center"/>

{{quote|I saw the Barbie commentary those two people in the commentary were making﻿ fun of you. [[Unrealistic expectations|Block them from going on YouTube.]]|{{youtube2|PaperShadow2001|PaperShadow2001}}|new to the Internets}}

Trolling operations of Alex began after [[METOKUR|a group of YouTube trolls]] released a [[YouTube Commentary|commentary]] over his review of [[Faggot|Barbie for the NES]].  [[JUST AS PLANNED|Unexpectedly]], Alex discovered the video that very same day it was posted, and soon, the video had more comments than it did views, thanks to Alex replying to multiple comments every time he visited the video to check the responses.  Eventually, things were set straight with the statistics, after the channel banned Alex from posting comments.  Not just once, mind you; but <i>FOUR TIMES</i>, as Alex happened to have [[Sockpuppet|multiple Youtube accounts]] on hand for exactly this kind of situation.  Onlookers realized that there was more to Alex than being a mere "AVGN ripoff", and that there was more fun to be had with this butthurt faggot.

== Alexander4488 vs. [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] ==
[[Image:Alexander4488.jpg‎|thumb|right|Our paranoid friend tried to [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Image:Alexander4488.jpg&action=history delete this picture] with [[User:Gamedude8888|three]] [[User:Alexander448|separate]] [[User:Mysterydude|accounts]]. For a guy who peddles his shit like a used car salesman, [[Hypocrite|he sure doesn't want his picture out there]].]]

[[Image:Alex4488demotivational2.jpg|500px|thumb|center|]]

{{quote|That ED article is just more advertisement for me and [[Lie|all game reviewers have an ED article]].|Alexander|failing to see how exposing him as a sheep fucker can be classified as advertisement}}

Because Alexander is typing his name into a search engine in a hourly basis he had to find [[Video_Game_Reviewer#Alexander4488|the blurb about him]] in the [[Video Game Reviewers|"Video Game Reviewers"]] article. In a case of extreme [[butthurt]] and [[batshit insane|insanity]] Alexander registered and [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Video_Game_Reviewers&diff=1998102573&oldid=1998101164 tried to delete his picture on said article] - [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Image:Alexander4488.jpg&action=history with two accounts]. The ED sysops didn't [[ED:VIP|tolerate these dumb actions]] and [[B&|banhammered]] his ass(es).<br>

But that wasn't enough for him to learn his lesson! Alexander registered [[User:Mysterydude|a third account]], this time with the purpose of [[Alexander4488/Director_Commentary|"commentating" on this ED article]] and [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Alexander4488&oldid=1998136769 vandalizing it]. This, of course, got his ass [[B&|"suspended"]] again - but that hasn't stopped him from returning again and again in his [[desperate]] attempt to "fix" this article.

''For a complete list of Alexander's sockpuppet accounts, see [[Alexander4488#SockPuppet Accounts|here]].''

=== Holy shit, he "appologizes"! (November 2009) ===

<center><youtube>0QqiZsj2Yzw</youtube></center>
Wow; and  here we thought he'd never learn! He's still an obnoxious [[faggot]] with a gigantic [[USI|self-inflated ego]], by the way.

=== After the Apology (October 2010) ===
Speaks for itself.
[[Image:Gamedudeoct2010.png|center]]

== Continued Trolling ==

It's clear that Alex is [[Chris-Chan|certainly easy enough to aggravate]]: All it takes is a single comment to summon him, though [[science]] has yet to [[AIDS|find a way to make him go away]] should you decide you no longer want to deal with him. However, with the number of [[You|unfunny YouTube-dwelling faggots]] emerging from the woodwork to [[Bukkake|take their respective shots at him]], one must question whether [[Emo|it's even worth joining the fight]] at this point.  It's obvious that the majority of users producing [[Shit|rant videos]] and [[Crap|commentaries]] at this stage in the game are doing so to gain [[Attention Whore|popularity]], rather than to get on Alex's nerves.

Does that mean that we should all [[An hero|drop whatever we have planned and leave him be]]?  Of course not: He's a goddamn quotable [[lolcow|goldmine]], and there are [[Raymond45154|few YouTubers]] with quite the same level of [[unwarranted self-importance]] as he.  However, in order to keep things fresh, and to prevent operations from becoming too played out, editors to this article need to stop dedicating entire sections to any irrelevant [[newfag]] who happens to take a shot at him, which should hopefully help to discourage other [[Boomstick545|newfags]] from putting together their own shitty videos in the hopes of getting mentioned on [[ED]].

=== The GameFuckingFuck Fiasco ===

In an attempt to demonstrate his influence over his fans, Alexander released a video in which he urged his fans to subscribe en masse to a user by the name of {{youtube2|TheGameFuckingFucker|The Game Fucking Fuck Fuck Fucker Fucking Fuck Fucker}} ''(A parody of every [[unfunny]] [[Video Game Reviewers|video game reviewer]], in association with [[METOKUR|a known trolling channel]])'', who Alexander had deluded himself into believing existed for [[USI|the sole purpose of parodying him]]. The catch was, the GFFFFFFF had [[An hero|committed suicide]] in the last episode of his series, when he [[Just as planned|accidentally]] started to become as popular as the [[greedy]] faggots he mocked. And so, Alexander declared that if he should get the GFFFFFFF over 500 subscribers, that he should feel obligated to return to YouTube once again.

<center><youtube>og6MzpWlmwE</youtube></center>

Rather than encourage Alexander's faggotry and fuel his ego, and rather than appease his own retarded fans, [[Delete fucking everything|the GFFFFFFF removed all his videos from his channel]], enraging Alexander and confusing his fans who were [[(sic)|basica]] being told to subscribe to a blank channel. A week later, after Alexander's "Deadline to Subscribe" had passed, the GFFFFFFF put his videos back up, proving himself to be the better man ''(And better [[Troll|reviewer]])''.

=== The Closet Furry and Failed [[YouTube Commentary|Commentator]] ===

Alexander4488's review of [[Star Fox]] [[Krystal|Adventures]] brought in two trolls named [[closet furry|GLaDOSexe]] and [[furry|spunkeez]], whom seemed to fail at [[ripoff|being inspired by]] [[commentary]] channels who had previously called Alex out on his shit. Alexandria posted a [[No life|NINE PART]] [[BAW|Emo Bawfest]] (see below) and re-uploaded his 2 PART Star Fox review, renaming it in honor of these [[furfags]] as he named the re-uploaded reviews [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmZDSQeSjqo "Blame the two furries for this"].

Interestingly enough, in addition to evidence of Alexander4488 being a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6roEA-bLsU Zoophile], he also makes mention of the snout on Fox's face being too short, as well as other [[furfag|questionable comments]].

[[image:AlexanderandCrystal.jpg|center]]

Since the aftermath of Alexander's continued retardation, [[Pussy troll|Spunkeez]] has given a [[no one cares|speech]] thanking Alexander4488 for helping him complete his life by trolling at least one [[loser|YouTube Reviewer]] before he dies.  Now that [[An Hero|he can die a happy man]], perhaps he'll be so kind as to [[RAGE|fade back into obscurity and refrain from sparking weak drama in the future, so his fans might stop trying to pass it off as legitimate trolling?]]

While also [[Tabloid|claiming]] that all the so called [[trolls]] are [[butthurt]] they are actually laughing at Alexander's failure. After he realised it was a stupid fucking idea to do commentaries in the first place he now [[ITG|threatens all the trolls with an ED page]]. Yeah, like [[Alexander4488/Director_Commentary|editing ED has worked so great for him so far]].

Ranting against [[Shit_no_one_cares_about|people no one cares about anymore]] in a hoodie. Yeah, really.

=== Alexander4488 Trolling Sentinelcl ===

In a further attempt to prove his badassery, Alex decided to attack Sentinelcl, a little known [[attention whore|user]] on YouTube who posts reviews and features for a tiny and insignificant audience. Sentinelcl ordered the "Game Dude" DVD in order to post a review of it; however, he never received it. So, he made a video warning his audience that the offer was likely a scam. Alex replied in an attempt to tear his warning video apart.  One part particularly amusing was when he was making fun of Sentinelcl for being fat and balding before showing a YouTube user by the name of Helsing920, surely one of the slimmest people of all YouTube.
