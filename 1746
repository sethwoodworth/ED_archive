Context
[[Context]] is what makes [[chat logs]] and comment wars unfunny.  The more context provided to a [[drama]]tic situation, the more [[unfunny]] that situation becomes.  We don't need no stinkin context!<br />

*'''badlydrawnjeff''': Okay then!  Would you like any mustard or ketchup?
*'''Quasidan''': Hell no.  Just a big, thick, naked weiner for me!
