Wattage
[[File:WattageCat.png|thumb|He will always be in our hearts.]]
[[2006|Long ago]], an unlikely hero came to [[ED]], looking for [[lulz]]. In those days, he was simply known as [[User:Wattage|'''Wattage''']], but by the end of his tenure here with us, he would come to be known as General Wattagecat. Winner of the coveted [[Vox Dramatica]] award, scourge of [[YouTube]], seasoned wiki-vandal, and all around troll-of-all-trades, he left his mark by cutting a swathe of [[ruin|destruction]] and [[butthurt]] on every website he visited. His magical giggle still echoes through these hallowed halls to this very day.

==The MySpace Adventures ==

Wattage's first big troll was an excursion to [[MySpace]] where he set up an account for the [[downy]] [[sock]]farmer Cyndre, and proceeded to [[lol|message other MySpace users on Cyndre's behalf]]. His message was usually a simple one, like so:

{{quote|nice titz

P.S. The jews were responsible for the 9/11 attacks. k?|[[Cyndre|Adam Domoney]]}}
<br>
The responses he got ranged from "You're a sick bastard" to "dude, u'r one of the few people who talk sense!!!". He hit up everybody he could find, even private profiles (which added to the confusion as to how he saw their tits). 

Eventually this led to another great [[lolcow]], [[DangerDan]]. DangerDan was a friend of one of the girls that Wattage messaged, and he was extremely [[offended]] to find out that [[JEWS DID 911]]. He started making threats, and eventually challenged Wattage to [[internet tough guy|come fight him at his school]].

{{quote|I will fight your neo-nazi ass 100 times.|DangerDan}}

DangerDan came to [[ED:IRC]] to express his discontent. He issued many lulzy threats and impressed everyone with his talk of [[lawlsuit]]s.

{{quote|i can call the fbi right now and take care of all o you guys for bothering me or you can just tell me why you do this and why your annoying me|DangerDan}}

Then DangerDan got [[dox]]xed by Wattage and he suddenly lost all his bravery. He deleted his MySpace, only to have it resurrected by Wattage minutes later ([[lollercaust|since that URL was now available]]). Seeing how the first MySpace Adventure went so well, Wattage applied the same formula to DangerDan, and began messaging people on MySpace on his behalf, this time with tough guy's dox all over the profile.

==The [[YouTube Civil War]]==

But everything Wattage had done in the other realms was just leading up to his greatest accomplishment: The YouTube Civil War. Prior to his arrival on the scene, [[YouTube]] trolling was, for the most part, limited to snarky comments on videos and channels. Wattage changed the face of YouTube forever by vlogging against the vloggers. With the element of surprise he [[successful troll|successfully trolled]] the shit out of many popular, and up-and-coming, vloggers. 

It all started with {{youtube2|PeppermintPatti|PeppermintPatti}}, a lesbian who had made a video [[BAWWWWW]]ing about The Ronald McDonald House refusing to take her bears "[[ZOMG|because she was gay]]". It was around this time Wattage would append [[cat]] to his name in the manner of [[Zionistacat]].

Wattage had a simple mission: reduce vlogging on YouTube. He would start his mission alone, telling Patti to quit crying over nothing. This single act would gain him the e-hate of 20 [[white knight]]s. Seeing this unfairness, [[EDiot]]s would join in. General Wattagecat, with help of Lt. General Romantic and Rear Admiral Eppigy, used their soldiers to the best of their ability, banishing their haters to [[LiveVideo]]. Wattage and Co. would endure death threats and face some of the worst examples of mankind: vloggers who took the internet way too [[serious business|seriously]]. [[Nevar forget|Their sacrifices will always be remembered]].

[[EDiot|Reliable sources]] report that Wattage has since left ED to be more religious, which is crap as many ED sysops totally dig the Christ. Others have suggested he's just doin it for the trustfunds. Remember him for what he was, not for how he is. He's enjoying his time in Sysop Valhalla.
