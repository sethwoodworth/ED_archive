'''Gloom''' is a ''Quake II'' mod that has been around since [[n00b]]s bragged about having 16MB ram in their screaming fast Pentium I computers.  A team of [[A RAPE SPIDER|spiders]] plays against a team of humans with a mission to completely destroy the other and their spawn points.

==Gameplay==
Aliens and humans have 8 classes that have different abilities.  The real object of this game is to see how quickly you can kill off your teammates, or 'TK' without getting banned.  The most successful way of doing this is pretending you're a n00b and standing in their way or intercepting their rockets so they take the credit for blowing your team up.

Now has a gloom map dedicated to [[4chan]], called partyvan.

EPIC FAIL.

==History==
[[Image:Howdoishotweb.jpg|thumb|Noobs often ask this]]
<li>'''The Beginning:'''  Gloom started before the year 2000.  It was created by a coding team called ''Team Reaction'' which broke up after the first one came out of the closet.  See: [[homosexual | gay]].  Shortly after that, [[homosexual|R1CH]] was rewarded with the source code after being the only one to give them all [[Fellatio | blowjobs]].  During this time, only one big American server existed.  It was named OneCall because it was hosted on OneCall server hosting.  This was provided free of charge by somebody who worked there.  

<li>'''The Tyranny of R1CH!'''  Years went by and R1CH got bored just looking at [[gay | homosexual]] porn so he decided that tinkering with various settings in the game and uploading them to the server was the best idea.  It went on like this for years and people hated them or they loved them.  Most of them eventually quit because of a long period of [[goatse|shitty]] changes and never listening to anybody's suggestions.  

<li>'''Fuck you R1CH!'''  One day an angry European [[13_year_old_boys|kiddie]] with a botnet decided to [[DDOS]] this main gaming server.  This cost the company a whole bunch of money and downtime so they were forced to take it down after it happened a second time.  This lead to America having no 40 player server so many people quit and moved on.  There were people who tried to catch and reason with this [[script kiddy]].  None of the attempts have turned up successful.

<li>'''The Tyranny of Echon!'''  Several months later, Echon, who was [[permabanned|Banned]] along with DaddyDeath from OneCall servers decided they would show them and created a big 40+ server of their own.  Echon lived at home at the time in a trailer with his [[bestiality|mother]] who is on food stamps.  He pays 200 dollars a month for hosting.  He gives all of his [[homosexual | good ol' boyz]] admin of which they all suck and are poor sports so they end up kicking and [[banned|banning]] people for killing them.  People bitch and moan on the [[forums]] and he tells them.  If you don't like it, find another server.  This is the only big server in America now.  The Gloom population slowly diminishes.

<li>'''Fuck you Echon!'''  The inevitable happens: Another server pops up and nobody knows for sure who runs it, however there is about 6 admins on there who are fed up with the abuse and cheating.  Everybody loves it except for the cronies.  When it was taking a load off Echon's bandwidth, he thanked them by getting a bunch of his cronies to join it and talk shit.  One by one they were [[banned]] and the server endured a lengthy [[DDOS]] attack.  <strike>This ate up all the monthly allowance of the server so they found a new hosting company with unlimited bandwidth.</strike>  That was false, it was a bad hosting company.

<li>'''[[Fag|R1CH]]''' - He proudly wears his Free Software Foundation t-shirt, but he refuses to open-source the Gloom dll. You will have to really suck up on R1CH to get that code, and swear an oath to his cause.  This may involve [[fellatio |sucking some dick]], which is likely the way he got it from Team Reaction to begin with.

<li>'''[[Echon]]''' - He's a virgin coder in his mid-20's who has never seen [[pussy]] except on [[4chan]].  He makes shitty, bloated versions of ''Quake II'' and sucks R1CH's cock every day, just hoping he can get his grubby hands on the gloom source code.  So far all he's gotten is a bad taste in his mouth.  See Echon's [[Incest|brother]], ''Schok''
<li>'''DaddyDeath''' - Once [[banned|permabanned]] from all servers for cheating and continually spamming the word black person to make himself sound cool.  He was later unbanned when his [[homosexual | gay]] lover, Echon gave him admin on his server.
<li>'''Mushroomface''' - He's a non-trogdolite and therefore [[homosexual]].  He only knows how to say one word: [[homosexual|faggot]].  80% of his forum posts consist of this word and ''only'' this word.
<li>'''Cataclaw''' - Three letters say it all: STG
<li>'''Eric Bauman''' - He was driving Schok's car, lawl
<li>'''Tom Mabe''' He slept with Cataclaw for beer money
</ol>

==People That Rock==
<ol>
<li>'''[[User:Cataclaw|Cataclaw]]''' He increased the [[lulz]] by deleting his [[Butthurt|OMG BUTTHURT]].  a.k.a. R1's Bitch.  Definitely rocks.  He would be devastated if you vandalized his [http://www.ytmnd.com/users/Cataclaw YTMND User Page] by downvoting all his YTMNDs so be nice and give him all fives.
<li>'''[[User:Tinactin|Tinactin]]''' Loves Cataclaw and plays with his penis.  See [[Sock_puppet]].  He also has [[AIDS]].
<li>[[Nobody]] else who plays gloom is cool, although some think they are hot [[shit]],
