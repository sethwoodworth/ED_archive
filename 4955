Long-term abuse
{{needsmore|tips on trolling}}
'''Long-term abuse''' ([[Wikipedese|WP:LTA]]) is the Wikipedia Hall of Fame for people who win at life. It is the place where Wikipedos enshrine vandals to make sure that their good deeds do not go unremembered, and to preserve history for posterity and should ultimately be where [[you]] want to land up.

The LTA page itself is a list of persistent vandals, with lulzy details on their vandalism. The Wikipedos seek to fight such vandalism by providing vanity glorifying the vandals they try to fight. LTA also has subpages, entire vanity pages dedicated to creating a shrine the really egregious vandals. If you troll or vandalize Wikipedia, your ultimate goal shall be to get your own Long term abuse subpage, your trophy indicating that you have won.
