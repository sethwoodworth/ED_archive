Sick of hearing ham-fisted rants about [[religion]] or [[Twilight]] on Youtube? Well luckily you because there are now videos of talking animals, mostly cats, are overflowing on the [[internet]].  Could this phenomenon have anything to do with the cancer that is [[ICHC|lolcats]], and other derivative faggotry, slowly destroying modern culture with its pernicious fail and AIDS? Noone knows for sure, but for whatever reason, this is yet another example of why we [[this is why we can't have nice things|can't have nice things]].

==Talking Cat Videos==

Talking cats come in three varieties:

===The First Variety: The cat mimic human words===

===The Second Variety: The cats simply mewl back and forth===

==Cat Yodeling==
For those who are new to the concept of [[lulz|animal abuse]] <b>Cat Yodeling</b> is the sport of picking up your pet and shaking them slightly as they mewl in disdain.

<b>Cat Yodeling</b> was invented by [http://uk.youtube.com/user/klusmanp Klusmanp], a native from Kansas. Although most [[Youtube]] users earn their article on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] for either suggesting that [[WolfJLupus|buggering your dog is a beautiful thing]] or [[furry|defending their animal spirit and right to dress and and splatter their pants wearing a fursuit]] - Klusmanp is famous for making [[lol|droll]] videos and musical felines.

===Corporal Cuddling===
Before learning the art of cat yodeling the owner must first understand corporal cuddling. Unless your cat has been endlessly molested since it was a kitten (and might even enjoy being picked up) most cats will complain slightly if you cuddle them. Kissing them makes it worse. Once they start mewling for long enough, annoy them further by shaking them and posting your embarrassing video on the internet.

Since the original <i>An Engineer's Guide to Cats</i> several other youtubers have tried to make their felines yodel, proving that [[Rules of the internet|all win eventually devolves into fail]].

An earlier, primitive form of cat yodeling was seen on the Anticyclonic clips [[Burger_the_Angry_Cat#MEOWARCHY|MEOWARCHY]]. Instead of the cats miaowing slightly, these cats would growl and hiss in anger while their owners continued to piss them off. In short -


<b>Successful Cat Yodeling:</b>
* Your cat makes a sustained musical noise when you shake it.
* Your cat is slightly annoyed but safe.
* You will get several youtube comments saying [[16 year old girl|"OMG sooooooo cute LOL I <3 U!!!1!one"]].


<b>Unsuccessful Cat Yodeling:</b>
* Your cat rips your bottom lips and arms.
* Your cat runs away.
* You will get several youtube comments saying [[16 year old girl|"OMFG animal aubse imma report u 2 the ASPCA!!!1!one."]]

===Other Pets===
So far cat yodeling has been limited to nothing but cats. But why not try other pets? Dog yodeling, [[User talk:Killhamster|hamster yodeling]] or even parrot yodeling.
