These cuffs is an old [[meme]] from 2007. A video reached the tubes about a black person midget getting arrested, for apparently doing [[Prostitution|'unauthorised street performing']]. After being chased by an unfit, [[PixelBeeProductions|obese]] pig, the arrested midget proclaims "I can break these cuffs!", to which the [[fat]] police officer assures him he cannot do. He then makes a futile attempt to break free, [[I came|yelling in frustration]], before giving up and collapsing on the front of the car.
