Over the years the question has popped up in the minds of many, everybody ranging from fans to haters of the show: Just what the hell is Brock's Nationality? Well as it turns out, Brock is [[Mexican]]. In the series he has both worn a sombrero and dress in traditional Mexican clothing in the show on multiple occasions and even has a [[WTF|dancing pineapple-duck]] named [[Alcohol|Too Much Tequila]]. He has many siblings an illegal immigrant daddy and a hot white [[milf|momma]] who live in [[America|Pewter City]]. Brock has also been known to breed red [[Chihuahuas]] and own a large collection of pet rocks. He is of short stature compared to most adults in the series but still taller than any of his traveling [[Aspies|companions]], he flirts with every woman he meets and was [[raped]] by an [[cougar|older woman]] named Professor Ivy. Brock is also known for his ability to perform just about any task imaginable and does much of the gang's cooking, cleaning, and general care-taking.
