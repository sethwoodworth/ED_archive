'''Volapük''' is a [[TOW|Wikipedia]], trolling exercise created by one of only 30 speakers of a language made up by a [[Germany|German]] [[priest|pedophile]]. The only user created so many pages with scripts that the Wikipedia is currently one of the 10 largest. 

This perfect troll provoked much discussion,[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Closure_of_Volapük_Wikipedia] but the result was, of course, to keep it, because the hive mind is unable to effectively deal with trolling. Because most of the normal TOW articles are scripted just the same, TOW has no leg to stand on.

== Fun Fact ==
[[Ryulong]] is listed as a member of the Volapuke Wikipedia.
