Angie The Atheist
[[Image:Angie_Abortionist.jpg|right|thumb|Do not make babies with this woman]]

'''Angie Jackson''', or [http://twitter.com/antitheistangie antitheistangie] to her Twitfag advocates and enemies, is a 27 year old woman who, quite rightly, thought that it would be an absolutely [[batshit|awesome]] idea to [[Twitter|Tweet]], in full and graphic detail, every [[God]] hating foetus flushing moment of an abortion she was having performed. The resulting [[lulz|shitstorm]] united many fundamentally opposite communities in outrage and disgust. [[Christfags]] and [[Atheist]]s, [[trolls]] and the stupid, and those who just wanted to mindlessly weigh in on the personal choice of someone who they should not give half a fuck about all had their say. Opinions flew back and forth, ignorance flourished, but the main thing here was that [[Twitter]] finally had a bit of drama to call it's own.


The jury is still out as to whether Angie is an [[epic]] [[troll]] of Godfags or simply a fetus-flushing nobody with an inexplicable desire to air her shit in public.

==An Incredibly Odd History==

Angie Jackson, of Tampa Bay, Florida was born into a [[cult]]. Whilst being badly raised within, she was [[rape|sexually abused]] for many years, which left her with a lifelong penchant for seeking the wrong kind of attention. Angie already has a legitimately [[retarded]], reportedly inbred child around the age of four, and it has been reported that she may have misunderstood abortion law in her state and been under the impression that this was the child she was having flushed, as opposed the potentially normal and lovable one growing inside of her inhospitable yet freshly minimalist uterus.

==Did She Think It Through?==

[[Some argue]], that this is a cynical publicity stunt from a woman who has, in the past, spoken publicly about her '''alleged''' sexual abuse, as well as every controversial aspect of religion she could even vaguely comprehend (hence her awesome username). We at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] disagree, and think that she is simply a dumb [[whore]] who wrongly felt that the [[internet]] was a valid support network and that she could become an [[internet celebrity]] by involving the public in her stupidity. 

{{quote|No one notices the contrast of white on white|Deep stuff from Angie there, [http://www.lyrics007.com/Counting%20Crows%20Lyrics/Round%20Here%20Lyrics.html which she stole from a Counting Crows song.]}}
===The Good News===
Since many [[Christians]] are also pro-choice they should feel happy, not only that atheists are baby-killing attention whores, but that Angie will never pass on her baby-killing attention whore genes to the next generation.

However [[creationism|Christians don't believe in evolution]] so fuck them and their worthless judgements.

===Public Outing===

In case you do not have a [[Twitter]] account, Angie kindly provided several [[YouTube]] videos surrounding the subject of her seemingly neverending quest to get the abortion. Please note the dirty whorish mouth and wicked lies:
