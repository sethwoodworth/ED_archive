==How to use Internet-IRL Warfare==

Usually Internet-IRL Warfare is based on something somebody posts on a [[forum]] on the internet. (Usually thinking that since they do not have their real name, and they are semi-[[anonymous]], they can write away their deepest thoughts and desires (fetishes) and they will be unphased IRL. However, people can use this to their advantage by finding out the persons address, phone number, or torment them personally if they or another forum member lives nearby. Usually the person who is doing the attack does not reveal their forum name or that they did it until sometime later.
