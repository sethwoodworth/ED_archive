Salvia

'''Salvia''' is a legal psychedelic, which means it's for the lulz. Salvia extracts are sold in head shops under various strengths ranging from 10x to over 9000x, but the only thing these numbers really indicate is how much you're going to have to pay for the shit. All extracts of salvia wear off in like 3-5 minutes, making the drug a huge waste of time. Salvia is for losers who can't buy LSD or mushrooms because they are afraid of breaking the law and have no friends.

''Salvia divinorum'' (AKA Diviner's [[Sage]]) is still mostly legal in the US and Europe and induces [[chat log]]s like the following:

:[[User:Damo|khelair]] (12:20): next time I'll communicate WITH them instead of just be a cog in their machine [[Image:dog.gif]]
:[[User:Neurophyre|neurophyre]] (12:20): [[Image:emot-LMAO.gif]]
:[[User:Damo|khelair]] (12:20): I'm serious [[Image:Trill_tearlaugh.png]]
:[[User:Damo|khelair]] (12:22): salvia requires a more freeflowing, looping surface
:[[User:Damo|khelair]] (12:22): [[Time Cube|IN MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS]] [[Image:dog.gif]]
:[[User:Neurophyre|neurophyre]] (12:22): you should start a salvia farm [[Image:Trill_bigsmile.png]]
:[[User:Damo|khelair]] (12:22): fuck THAT I need to start a [[cunt|CUNT]] [[Image:dog.gif]]
:[[User:Damo|khelair]] (12:22): er, [[cult|CULT]], even [[Image:emot-LMAO.gif]]

Smoking salvia for the first time.

'''[[PROTIP]]:''' Chew the leaves instead of smoking and it will last a bit longer. Better yet, sell it all to some 5th graders and buy a real hallucinogen. Or try eat the whole plant, this will result in <s>nothing</s> uber [[lulz]]

==Saliva (disambiguation for the dyslexic)==

Saliva (also referred to as spit, spittle or slobber) is the watery and usually frothy substance produced in the mouths of humans and most other animals. Spit can be used as a lube for anal sex, for a good, fun anal sex experience [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19131893]. Spitting or expectoration is the act of forcibly ejecting saliva or other substances from the mouth, and only in [[China]] it is considered socially  acceptable, the filthy [[Asian]] bastards. Gleeting (also gleeking, gleeping, glitting, gleaking, glicking, glanding, geezing) is the projection of saliva from the submandibular gland upon compression by the tongue [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting#Gleeting], whatever the fuck that means. Finally '''Toxic Saliva''' is a spell from [[WoW]] and is thought to be inspired by the venonmous gobbing of snakes, camels and slobbery dogs [http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=7125].
