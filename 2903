'''The Federal Reserve''' is '''THE''' banking system of the [[United States]] formed in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Act.  Recently, under orders from the [[President]], they have "lost" '''9 trillion dollars''' so you can be certain they are a government agency doing an exemplary job within the confines and constraints of their job description.

Just for [[context]], this is what a trillion dollars looks like. Those are all $100 bills, the highest form of US currency. Remember, The Federal Reserve has lost <big>'''9'''</big> of these.<br>

==History==

The Federal Reserve is an independent financial institution not owned by the US Government. The Fed creates money out of thin air and loans each dollar to the US Government. So every dollar has debt attached that the government (American tax payers) must repay. 

The Federal Reserve is privately owned, secretive and unaccountable for its actions. It's responsible for major economic manipulation, economic bubbles and other economic screw-ups due to its pseudo capitalistic policies. The Federal Reserve Note (aka US dollar) has lost a staggering 96% of its purchasing power since 1913.

In 2010 America had over 13 trillion dollars in national debt and unfunded obligations. The interest rates on the national debt will rise drastically in the coming decades. When America cannot repay its debt that can lead to perpetual slavery of the entire population.

Meanwhile, the international banksters get rich off American tax payers whom for example financed the bail out of bad banks.

If the Fed was owned by the US Treasury it would produce dollars debt free. However, that's currently not the case.

==Woodrow Wilson & Rothschild==

The Rothschild bankster family funded Woodrow Wilson's Presidential campaign on condition that Wilson passes the Federal Reserve Banking Act.  
Today the Rothschild's are the primary owners of the Federal Reserve Bank.  They control most of the world and through the control of central banks have instigated more wars and horror than any other family throughout history.

President Woodrow Wilson showed regret for ruining his nation after he signed the Federal Reserve Act on December 23, 1913:

{{quote|I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.|[-Woodrow Wilson, National Economy and the Banking System, Senate Documents, Col. 3 No. 23]}}
