'''GoreGrish''' is a gore forum started [[last thursday]] after a lot of oldfags and newfags alike were banned or unable to register at the then private [[ogrish]] forums.  [[Failfags|Uncoverreality]] had fallen into the hands of an [[aspie]] (no shit he has [[tourettes]]) who bought the forum for a [[Nigeria|ridiculous amount of money]] off a [[britfag]] still owing money on his BMW and supporting a [[Amy_Winehouse|heroin addict]] he met online. The new aspie owner started banning all the [[niggers|good members]] right before announcing it now costs 5 bucks to join a gore forum that steals it's content from others, like they all do. Luckily some [[Australia|Australian]] guy was on hand with a forum already populated by tumbleweeds and closet fags, and more people started showing up.

==Humble Beginnings==
GoreGrish started with around 16 [[Admin|admins]] and 27 members. Using [[fail|vBulletin]]. Of course, [[Doing_it_wrong|this didn't work]]. The site moved over to a forum software called xenforo, which is kinda like a broken [[facebook]]. Many of the oldfags complained the new software was too new and longed for the days of 56k modems and simpler times, circa [[ogrish]] 2004. Ajax effects such as inline popups scared the older folks away, probably back to [[Rotten.com|rotten]] and it's table based HTML structure.

==1921â€“1933==

A Stalinist purge by the fucking [[jews|kikes]] who run the place seen the admin staff number reduced to three and the overall membership go up by thirteen people. Nine of whom [[An_hero|committed suicide]] on hearing they were demoted, thus some e-cred was seriously raped. Several weeks later 1500 people had joined, including rock sensation [[Billy Idol]] although most of them were sock puppets of previously banned members and Bill later [[An_hero|An hero]] in tragic circumstances. [[Over 9000]] image attachments on the site have been added, mostly shit you seen in 2002.

==Later That Day==
Someone reported GoreGrish for hosting [[Child_porn|child porn]] to the sites [[Steam|datacenter]] host, the admin team were furious as they never included a dedicated child porn section, but pics of dead raped babies are okay thanks. The CP report on goregrish was traced back to the infamous ass-rapist [[flaglerchat]], AKA internet [[AIDS|cancer]].

==The Future: Bleak==

The site is now awash with oldfags again, forum rivals and other assorted [[faggotry]]. The admins are rarely seen, pretending they have [[irl]] to deal with but in reality they are bloated with with ice cream, pizza and cheap wine from users paypal donations. A frontpage was started with articles and video, however it soon became apparent no one could write and the talentless hacks discovered cut/paste has a detrimental effect with [[SEO]] and the [[Google]]. Every time something goes wrong they just fire more staff and blame the members. The customer is always right.

It is believed the site will eventually become a financial burden on the owners and be sold off as a serious investment for those looking to get into their feet wet in the [[Economic_Crisis|gore hosting business]], or someone who enjoys accusations of being a [[pedophile]].
