'''You're the man now dog!''' (sometimes '''YTMND''') is an [[unfunny]] site where [[Over 9000|6 million]] [[old meme|old meme]]s (that eat the shit out of your history) go to be [[Holocaust|recycled]]. It features a huge number of [[Wikipedia|ripoff]]s that [[Retard|fan]]s think are original because they are [[13-year-old boy]]s who [[basement dwellers|do not get out much]]. It is a widely known fact that YTMND is a [[lulz]] killer.  This makes sense since YTMND is an old meme, although this fact is lost among its [[13-year-old boy|userbase]]. YTMNDs generally include 5,000 kb wav files or 7kb midis and each one has a new copy so you have to download it all over again.  It was created by [[Pig|Max Goldberg]], a money hoarding Jew.  In December 2006, Max decided to totally alter the rules for creating sites so that no one could make sites with "LOL", "OMG", "[[fail|O RLY]]" or basically anything a [[13 year old boy]] would find OMGROFL.  YTMND is now expected to die a death befitting all old memes. There may be a YTMNB forum to replace it if it does so (You're the man now bitch!). 90% of all YTMND's are from 4chan and require no creativity to make them, All funny/creative YTMNDs will be flamed and ridiculed, to fit in on YTMND you must steal old memes from other sites. In fact, YTMND is the only website on the interbutts where people bitch about [[ebaumsworld|stolen content]] while creating stolen content.

YTMND is [[b/|/b/]] with background music and if it had a popularity contest. [[Some argue]] it is "the most addictive time-waster on the [[internets]]", a quote often used to describe [[porn]]. This makes sense, however, since most fanboys would be willing to [[fap]] to YTMND at the drop of a dime.

== How to create a YTMND ==
1. steal a picture from /b/ or /gif/<br>
2. download your favorite song from [[limewire]]<br>
3. add them together on YTMND<br>
4. [[????]]<br>
5a. [[Profit|PROFIT!!]]<br>
5b. if you're lucky, your site will become a [[meme|fad]]

==YTMND Forums==

[[Image:ytmndforums.jpg|thumb|right|Typical YTMND Forums bullshit. Yes'um, they're breeding them [[fat|attractive]] over there.]]

[[Image:irll.jpg|right|thumb|These are probably not YTMND forum members since they do not go outside [[IRL]].]]

The YTMND [[forum]]s are much like any other [[internets]] forums. New members are [[permabanned]] at the first conceivable opportunity. However, banned persons can un-ban themselves with a bribe because Max is a Jew.

The YTMND forums are a cesspool of internet [[racism]], [[homosexuality|homoeroticism]] and [[Republican|sexism]]. While usually that would be a good thing (ok, maybe not homoeroticism), severe lack of [[funny]] makes it so [[anti-lulz]]y that [[you]]'ll become so [[unfunny|boring]] you'll have to be put down, should you ever visit it. The only thing you will see the forum members posting are the words "[[Faggot]]", "[[Gay]]", "[[Cocksucker]]", "Jew", and "black person".  At times when they cannot think of witty racial slurs to post, they will post [[goatse|shock pictures]]. You have to be over 18 to view and post at the forums but it's clear from the content that all members are in their early teens due to some of the forum discussion which revolves around how "7th grade is so hard" and how bad their parents suck.

YTMND forums are so boring that members occasionally attempt to organize invasions on other forums, none of which are ever successful due to the lack of attention span in a child who hasn't taken his Ritalin for the day. In the summer of [[2005]], YTMND forums members [[crapflood]]ed a [[Natalee Holloway]] tribute forum into oblivion, causing the [[admin]]istrator to shut it down entirely. This is considered the forum's greatest accomplishment because decent human beings all [[Rape|hate]] Natalee Holloway.

There have also been several spinoff forums, all of which were [[gay]], all created on free forum services, and all deleted due to various [[TOS]] violations. The only one alive now is [[Almighty lol]], which is filled with self-loathing losers who alternate between making fun of the YTMND Forums and its [[faggot|members]] and masturbating to pictures of [[lemon party|naked old men]].

Due to owner [[Max Goldberg]]'s quest for more [[Jew gold]] a separate [[NSFW]] forum has been set up and a [[safe for work]] forum is reportedly in development.  The [[SFW]] forum will be a paradise of [[front page fags]] asking for critiques of their [[unfunny|overplayed/unfunny]] YTMNDs and detailed discussions of how ugly [[Brian Peppers]] will take place. Max will eventually give up when he realizes that he can not accumulate a sufficient amount of [[Jew gold]] from forum advertising directed at [[13 year old boy]]s with no money.

Max Goldberg gets huge boners when YTMND is mentioned on retarded TV shows like G4/TechTV or fellow Jew at CNN, Jeanie Mose. YTMND claims they were '''mentioned''' on the report, however all you can see is kike Mose sitting in front of a computer looking at YTMNDs. Mose does nothing at CNN but sits on her wide Jewish ass, browsing YTMNDs and making idiotic 5 minute filler clips for CNN that are only funny to her and YTMND users. Goldberg also claims to be in the ''Washington Post'', however he was only mentioned on WP's BLOG. YES, NOT THE ACTUAL JEWSPAPER. This is proof that YTMND is an attempt by Mr. Goldberg to have a sense of purpose in a world full of thieving Jews like himself.

== YTMND Chat on EFNet ==
[http://home.graffiti.net/ytmndpwned:graffiti.net/ytmnd-pwned.txt Log of minor takeover] that occurred [[last Thursday]].  [[Max Goldberg]] was drunk, high, or on a rush from cock ball torture was cleaning up the ban lists, deop'd all the ops, and was idle. He came back and op'd who he thought were his channel ops, when someone had a bot holding a chan op's "nickname". The user then waited for the right time, deop'd and kicked max. Only one operator was not on [[Undernet]] looking for gay sex, so the situation was fixed. The typical channel operator is a suck up to Mr. Goldberg and hasn't been on IRC ever until there was a link on the frontpage of YTMND.

After Max Goldberg was given IRC Op on EFNet he endorsed a jupe or server ban of the channel #ytmndforums. It is now an "illegal channel name" on over 50% of EFNet servers. In response to this, members of #ytmndforums decided to let Max have his alphabet back and abandoned the channel. They formed a new channel on EFNet called #wop which is for the members of YTMND forums and [[AlmightyLOL]], a YTMND forums spin off.

== YTMND Ventrilo ==
On February 23, 2006, Fyrestorm decided that he wanted a way for the community of YTMND to have a way to communicate VOIP, rather than through text. High and most likely had a fat floppy dong in his mouth, he subscribed to a ventrilo server. The server initially gained more popularity from the "Put Shoe on Head" fad that spawned from it. What happened from that day was absolutely horrible. The world slowly became an acid trip for most of these users. Their overuse of their time in ventrilo slowly made them into NeoNaziFullyRacistCretins, or NNFRC for short. This swallows up the internet slowly everyday. This ventrilo being led by Fyrestorm also love combining powers with 4chan and SomethingAwful for ultimate trolling faggotry. If you dare enter into this ventrilo, Be wary if you are to troll, You might just get trolled yourself resulting in [[suicide]] and [[homosexuality]]. However, to go there to listen on conversations will be ultimately disappointing. Nearly at least one hundred percent of the time it is about a game nobody has ever played or heard of and like twenty people talking about it at once. Making a crack about it in the chat (i.e. doing a snoring sound) will get you a years-worth ban.

== Church of [[Scientology]], Objective Ministries and YTMND ==
After YTMNDs were made that conveyed to the [[retard|public]] the dangers of the [[murder]]ous cult, the Church of Scientology's [[internet lawyer|legal team]] issued a cease and desist letter to YTMND, causing Max and various space [[alien]]s to <s>quake with fear</s> say fuck you to Scientology by putting a Scientology section on the front page.

See: http://theunfunnytruth.ytmnd.com/ for more  

The Christian fundamentalist site [http://www.objectiveministries.org objectiveministries.org]
has declared YTMND a [http://www.objectiveministries.org/news/ terrorist site.]  [[13 year old boys|YTMND members]] thought this was really [[cool]] but they were in fact [[pwn]]ed because objective ministries is a [[satire]] site.

==The Video That Started It All==

Only one [[cunt]] of a man could start something so big: [[Sean Connery]]. In the film the Finding Forester, Sean began something even he had no control over.

==Trolling YTMND==
Aside from making horrible sites on purpose, the best way to troll YTMND has recently been discovered.  Several [[Jesus]] [[fanboys]] have been making sites promoting [[teh]] [[Bible]]. They then use their [[unlimited disposable income]] to sponsor the pro-Jesus sites so that it will stay on the front page, enraging Jews and Satan worshipers alike.  It all started when a [[fat]] [[virgin]] made a [http://ytmnd.com/sites/profile/543524/ site] bashing [[evolution]]ary science, which caused a huge [[shit]]storm of infighting between the [[atheist]] users and [[13-year-old boy]]s who suck [[Jesus]]'s [[cock]] for cocaine. Much drama and [[lulz]] ensued. Other users made slideshow presentations about [http://ytmnd.com/sites/profile/592403/ Catholics] [[pwn]]ing [[irl]] [[n00b]]s.  The comments sections of these sites have become such a warzone that Rabbi [[Max Goldberg]] has ordered a cease and desist on several users. Nevertheless, he is a money-grubbing Jew, so he still takes their money.  Making a religious or a religious-bashing site seems to be the best way to agitate the shit out of everyone on YTMND.

A classic way of trolling YTMND is to make sites with the same shick image and sound.[http://ytmnd.com/users/oobleglork/] Some regular users do this to gain [[e-fame]]. Additionally, one can make a fad related title, but the YTMND itself contains nothing but a [http://seasonedmen.com naked old man]. Shock material is not always necessary.  If one wants to do the "fake noob troll" then simply make your image and sound so bad that it is obvious to anyone who is not a hippy faggot cocksucker that you are a troll. 

Another way to troll YTMND that has been proven quite effective is to make sites depicting [http://ogrishpeta.ytmnd.com animal cruelty] in a somewhat glorifying, obnoxious, and kewl manner. YTMND users care more about animal mutilation than actual human mutilation. [[Some argue]] that YTMND users may be closeted [[furries]]. One can also spread troll links around serious YTMND sites along with a downvote to let the viewer know they have been trolled in some way or another. However, do not confuse a downvoter for a troll. A downvoter is most likely not a troll and merely just an angsty YTMND user that's pissed off because his sites were never successful. The exception to this rule is a downvoter who downvotes everything except troll sites and spreads troll links.

Currently there are a few YTMND trolls lurking around, all of which troll in a different way. Some concentrate on fake, self-created fads or fake fads in general. They bait users to enter a fake fad site they created that in reality contains some sort of shock picture and audio. This would be a <s>[http://ytmnd.com/users/superdreamkilla/ Front-Page Troll]</s>[[B&]] who concentrates mostly on spamming and trolling the Front Page. Others however Troll in the name of the YTMNSFW [[forum]]s, which are currently overrun by angry child molesters, the mentally deranged, and [[Nazi]] party members. Most of these are either forum inside jokes, or the occasional fake fad/[[shock site]]. This would be known as a [http://ytmnd.com/users/agentadair/ NSFWForum Troll]. Last but not least there's the simple [http://ytmnd.com/users/halo1gamer/ Fake Noob Troll] which is of course self-explanatory. Any of these ways is effective and produce [[lulz]].
