Sextips
{{ljcomm|sextips}} is a [[sex]] [[community]] on [[LiveJournal]]. It is heavily [[moderator|moderated]], but [[drama]] does pop up once in a while. 

==Drama-Generating Topics in Sextips==
The active posters in Sextips are generally very open-minded and freak-sex nymphos, so it is hard to phase them. However, these topics seem to push their buttons:
*Pregnancy (see also [[amipregnant]])
*[[Birth control]]
*[[Rape]] 
[[Image:whynosperm.jpg|thumb|YOU ARE [[DOING IT WRONG]]]]

The best way to get them angry is to ask blindingly stupid questions, such as whether Coca-Cola works as an anti-pregnancy douche like you heard in high school, or whether it's true that you can get herpes from toilet seats. The moderators are dangerously good at deleting posts by [[trolls]], though, so make sure your [[bait]] is subtle.

==Rivals==
*{{ljcomm|sex_tips}}, which allows moar trolling
*{{ljcomm|sex_masterclass}}, for people who know that tab A goes into slot B
*{{ljcomm|vaginapagina}} ([[Vaginapagina|article here]])
