'''Ronders''' was once an ordinary teenage girl working at Wal*Mart. At five feet tall and 90 pounds, she clocked in as [http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/ slightly underweight] by normal standards, but not necessarily at death's door. She frequented many [[eating disorder]] sites online, including [[AOL]]'s Life - Eating Disorders. In that chatroom, a [[hardcore]] [[internet detective]] by the name of CarrieCndn had elected herself [[Internet Police|chief arbiter]] of who did and did not have an "official" eating disorder. She would secretly visit people or send her agents to do so, and then reveal her "findings" in the chatroom. consistantly decided people were fakes, usually after secretly visiting them or sending someone else to do so, and repeatedly called them on it in the chatroom.

Ronders eventually ended up in Remuda Ranch, a clinic where she was taught the importance of eating many yummy foods, and that nobody is allowed to starve themselves except Jesus. Amen. She was also put on some seriously fattening antipsychotic medication, after insisting the [[batshit insane|voices]] told her she was [[fat]].

== But I really have an eating disorder, I swear! == 
Flash forward a few years, and Ronders had gotten positively chunky, without bothering to mention that fact in the chatroom she so loved. Somehow, she got caught, and CarrieCndn began spamming the channel about how Ronders was a big fatty fat fake. Ronders was desperate to "prove" herself legitimately eating disordered, but was completely unable to take the weight off again.

Finally, she reluctantly accepted the title of bulimic, but found that nobody believed her anyways. She sought out help in proving herself, including allowing many photographs and some video footage to be shot of her doing the dirty deed.
