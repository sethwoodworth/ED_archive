Private tracker
{{stub}}

A '''private tracker''' is a [[1337]] super sekrit [[P2P]] network where [[you]] can't steal music unless you are invited to. But -to paraphrase [[Hitler|Groucho Marx]]- who would want to be a member of a club that would invite a person like [[you]]?

Private trackers are '''not''' places you go to [[pirate|dine]] and [[GTFO|dash]] because you must maintain a decent [[gay|share ratio]] to avoid getting [[b&]]. To whit, if you join a private tracker, be prepared to leave your [[Bittorrent]] client open and hogging [[CPU]] and [[r√¶p]]ing your bandwidth 24/7/365 thereby alerting your [[ISP]] that you are stealing music, software, audio books, and [[pr0n]].

==Benefits of Private Trackers==
'''Private trackers''' are pretty much safe from the evil [[RIAA]] however, the [[WEB SHERIFF]] may shoot your pre-release music [[torrent]] down like a no good, ornery varmint mid-snatch if it gets to it before it is completely downloaded and [[pwn]] your share ratio.

Since everyone leaves their torrent client running and are not [[Gay|fags]] and don't set their upload limit to 1kb/s, you can download [[pr0n]] as fast as your shitty [[ISP]] will alllow you to, also because 4 out of every 10 people on a private tracker are not fucking poor like [[you]] and will spend money on a seedbox, which is a server with a really fast internet connection. 

On any legitimate tracker, SCC or TL for example, all the torrents are group releases (Scene or P2P), with the name format of "ReleaseName.ReleaseType.ReleaseTypeSpecifics-GroupName". Sites that don't are shit tier trackers with individual releases, in other words a waste of time. Both SCC and TL have Scene releases, which are FXP'd from a Topsite (generally a 1-2gbps 20tb+ private server used by the highest players in the piracy scene) to an uploader's seedbox, where it is then made available on the tracker upon the completion of the torrent creation. Sites such as TL have their own internal release groups as well, which post their torrents exclusively on the site. Due to only select individuals having uploading privileges, the quality and reliability of torrents is incomparable to the [[fail]] found in public trackers. Bottom line is your [[porn]] will be virus-free and finished downloading before you even have a chance to whip it out.
