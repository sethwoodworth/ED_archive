==History==
There are several theories on how the universe started and the [[human]] race came into being.  One theory is a [[god|big bearded superadmin]] got bored on their week off; he (<s>she or it</s> women aren't allowed to <s>NOT</s> be god.) started fucking about with light and [[shit]] and by day six they had invented just about everything.  Another theory is that first there was nothing, and then that nothing exploded into something and over billions of years that something evolved into the fucked up universe we know today.  [[Religion]] and [[Science]], nobody knows for sure who is right, everybody is really just guessing. Even those who know how to use [[Google]].

What is known for sure is that whatever brought the human race kicking and screaming into existence, whether it be Creation or Evolution, someone royally fucked up; resulting in thousands and possibly millions of [[fucktard]]s being born.

By the twenty-first century, many of these [[fucktard]]s learned how to use the [[internets]].  Confronted by so many pages of information and creative outlets, many of these poor cretins were mentally unhinged and sent into fits.  With foam emitting from their herpes-infested mouths, many tapped into their most primeval instincts and those instincts told them to smash and destroy anything that scared their feeble minds.  And OMG! LOL! Wikis let you create an account and change their content!  Even cretins can be uber leet webpage h4xorz!  Thus the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] vandal was born.

===Anatomy of an ED vandal===
[[Image:Wikitalklulz.JPG|thumb|Once the article is locked, consider trolling the discussion page.]]
Encyclopedia Dramatica vandals DO NOT understand the following concepts:
*Encyclopedia Dramatica has been created to spread [[lulz]].
*The majority of Encyclopedia Dramatica articles are [[lie|truth]]. It's sad, but true.
*Encyclopedia Dramatica's patrons like ED because it spreads lulz.
*It's easier to vandalize after you take the cock out of your mouth first.
*Trying to destroy or deface a popular wiki is like pissing against the wind.
*Nobody cares what they think.
*Trousers go on BEFORE the underwear.
*ED Vandals defiled my grandmother once...

Theoretically, a very patient social worker could explain the above points, but without a [[list of sex moves|good tumble in the sack]], an ED vandal is never going to be cured of their chronic [[retard]]ation. Unfortunately, all ED vandals are obscenely ugly. Naked encounters with other members of the human race are absolutely forbidden; partly to stop these asspies from reproducing, but mainly because [[rape]] is illegal.

===What to do if you encounter a vandal on ED===
[[Image:Raepture.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Wiki mudkip vandal]]
As of yet, no organizations have been set up to counsel those who have come into contact with a vandal because nobody affected by a vandal particularly needs any counseling.  Vandals have not realized that their defacing of the [[lulz]] is not only inconsequential, but provides more lulz at their expense.  Bear in mind the following steps to survive an encounter with a vandal:
----
*DO NOT make eye contact.  They won't savage you like a baboon, but as mentioned earlier, they are [[ugly]].
*QUIETLY and CALMLY revert everything they have done.
*WAIT PATIENTLY for an admin to ban them and their [[sockpuppet]] accounts.
*Point at them and laugh.  It's allowed; they are [[Criminal_Scum#STOP_RIGHT_THERE.2C_CRIMINAL_SCUM.21|worthless scum]].

==How to become a wiki vandal==
{{Main|Vandal/How-to}}
In recent weeks, Wikipedia and other wikis have descended into a glorious orgy of vandalism, with vandals spontaneously ganging up on pages. However this has lead to a decline in [[IRL]] vandalism as kids don't get out enough nowadays and just fuck around on computers instead.  To get into the world of wiki vandalism, follow the following protips.  This time next week you could be the new [[Willy on Wheels]]!

===How to mess with insane site administrators (variations on Grawp technique)===
[[File:Mewikiblock.jpg|center]]
'''And that's how it's done.'''

If you want to troll insane admins, you should post something random that is normal or not harmful like ''"diesel is the best drink"'' or ''"diesel - one gallon a day keeps the doctor away"'' ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Dieseldrinker <s>example here</s>DELETED]). Then go to a wiki and just repeat it over and over.  People did that at the German Wikipedia and now saying anything about diesel results in a permaban.

Even better, find a wiki with really crazy administrators.  For instance, http://www.memory-alpha.org , will falsely call any talk page comments by an IP address or new user as vandalism ''no matter what''.  See <s>[http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/index.php?title=Talk:PADD&action=history]</s>[http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Talk:PADD deleted] and [http://masseffect.wikia.com the Mass Effect wiki] where they will even go so far as to tell you exactly why they think iPhones aren't related to the pages you just vandalized.  Just go somewhere on these sites and mention that X Star Trek or [[Mass Effect]] technology resembles iPhones until iPhones becomes a word for permaban. For best measure, see the contributions by this user [http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Cid_Highwind] and copy and paste what they wrote around to different articles.  Use [[Alt+173]] in the middle of text that is blocked by any new wordfilters they put up to bypass them.  They will usually freak and protect Special:Allpages for hours so nobody can edit but sysops and when you make them do that, you win!  The Memory Alpha admin "Shran" is most likely to freak at the first bout of vandalism and he is unemployed and is on the site 16 hours a day, but when he's not there the admins are lazy so calling in help from friends so they see lots of different IP ranges will make them go ape.  It is best to vandalize templates [http://memory-alpha.org/en/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&from=&namespace=10] because their site has caching problems and so the vandalism will often get stuck in pages after it has been reverted.

The thing is, the already crazy admins go even crazier as this happens day after day and they see they can do nothing to stop it.  For example, [[Grawp]] made Wikipedia fall to its knees.
