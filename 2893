The [[ED Forums]] have their fair share of [[lolcow]]s (a necessary part of healthy forum ecology), but among the [[retards]] and [[aspies]], two stand out as deserving their own article; those persons are '''[http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/member.php?u=1078%20Prof.%20Faust Prof. Faust]''' and '''[http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/member.php?u=4426%20Kikyo%20Maaka Kikyo Maaka]'''.

Professor Heinrich Faust is an unlovable entity that foolishly came [[hugbox|looking for love]] on [[ED IRC]].

One day, [[user:Pory|a girl]] [http://www.fanfiction.net/u/704258/Kikyo_Maaka who writes fanfiction] from her grandparents' basement annex (her parents live in her grandparents' basement) using the [[pseudonym|handle]] '''Pory''' (AKA [[inuyasha|KikyoMaaka]] AKA [[weeaboo|KikyoTenshi]] AKA Hello Link) wandered into ED IRC. Being a [[vagina|gentle and sensitive soul]], she complimented Faust on his [[lol|magnificent figure]]. He instantly fell in love with Pory. Heartbreak later ensued and their e-relationship is still to this day mocked in small corners of the [[Internet]] and generally serves as an example of [[Common sense|what not to be in life]]. It's the ED version of Romeo and Juliet with even more lulz, and no [[suicide]]... yet.

==The Beginning==
[[File:FaustInLoev.PNG|thumb|A [[GOTIS|girl on the Internet]] loves me!~]]
[[File:Flintstones-pills.png|thumb|left|The real culprit, [[bullshit|medicine]].]]
The two had met during a [[Skype]] chat, along with two other EDiots. In the beginning not much was said between them due to how fucking boring they are as people, but one night he mustered up enough [[Blood Alcohol Content|courage]] to strike up a conversation. Afterwards, the two commonly spoke every day to level up their [[Real life|socializing]] points.

Eventually, one night, Pory had conceded to her lonely fate and put Faust as her boyfriend on [[Facebook]], mainly because she felt a need for a [[sex|significant other]] in her life. Faust accepted the relationship status and the two were thrilled to finally take their love [[cyber|a little further]].

About a week or so later, Pory's doctor had given her [[drugs]] for her migraines which [[PMS|caused her to act abnormally]]. [[JUST AS PLANNED|This eventually led to her having increased feelings toward Faust]], which she would allegedly later regret.

==Pokemon love doesn't always end in middle school.==
[[File:PorygonxFaust.PNG|thumb|left|It's [[true]] love <3]]
The [[love]], according to Pory, was induced by the psychoactives her [[dealer|doctor]] had given her. In reality, their love was as potent and pure as the jizz stains on Faust's dungarees; the catalyst to their percolating love was formed with their mutually desperate [[weeaboo]] outcries for something more to hump than just a pillow. It doesn't take a genius to realize the e-relationship had been based on hours of lonely IRC [[PM]]ing and late-night Skype sessions.

Despite the phony excuse she made about drugs affecting her decision-making ability, she actively engaged in "[[sexting]]", which led them to [[cyber]] and discuss their horniness levels [[gross|with great aplomb]]. He also stated that he wanted to go visit her for a "real romance," which she agreed to and [[here come the lulz|they would both soon regret]].

'''[[raped|The next two weeks were a blur.]]'''

Finally -- after countless people mocked their glorious union as an IRC couple -- Pory gave in to peer pressure and broke Faust's achy-breaky heart, leaving the two with [[lol|bottomless voids in their souls]].

==Breaking Up==
[[File:Lolinternetgirlfriend.PNG|thumb|{{align|center|''';_;'''}}]]
{{quote|Will you "troll" me?|Faust, during a Skype chat}}
The breakup had occurred while Pory and Faust were planning their hookup in [[Canadia]]. Despite Pory being pressured into breaking up with Faust, he thought he still had a chance to [[virgin|become a man]]. The Hilton he chose to stay at was unwilling to give him a refund for his reservation, so he went to the country anyway, hoping things would [[pity sex|turn out good]] for him. At this time, it's believed Pory and Faust planned to break off the e-relationship in public to lose the attention of [[ED IRC]]ers and [[EDF]]ers. One theory is that Pory had only pretended she had broken things off and the two had never changed their plan to give eachother mutual pity sex. They are said to still communicate on Skype.

==[[desperate|Meeting Up IRL]]==
[[File:Rouge dress 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[user:Rouge|Rouge]], the [[Transvestite|man]] who allegedly gets Faust's sloppy seconds. She sure knows how to pick 'em, [[eh]]?]]
[[File:Pory likes science projects.jpg|thumb|right|She dumped him for the science fair.]]
On Friday, June 25th, the two met in person. Neither of them knew what to expect from this, as they both lack experience in communicating with other humans [[IRL]]. Afraid to interact with another individual, she attempted to flee Faust's tender grip. However, Pory gave into temptation and surrendered her [[virginity|dignity]] and gave him a pity fuck.

The two are documented to have met once more after the initial encounter -- probably due to the fact that they both desired to be together despite what other people thought of their [[hentai|healthy relationship]].  Faust sent her a letter -- which she wept at while reading for feeling ashamed that she had broken up with her [[CWC|one true heartsweet]] in front of an [[you|Internet audience]]. Notice how this letter is handwritten; something only [[gay|romantic individuals]] do.

This being a copy of the letter (note the faint tear stains):

{{Bigtext|
Dear Meagan,

Here I am, once again I have fallen for a woman it seems has not fallen for me. It is the rule of my life. Every time I am rebuked, and every time I sink lower into despair.

When I met you, you were [[lie|friendly]], [[lie|beautiful]], and [[lie|clever]]. How could I not love you when you are the first person to tell me that I am not [[boring]], that I am not [[ugly]], and that I am not cruel? And when you replied that you liked me too, I thought it miraculous - that I might be loved by someone for who I am - it was incredible! it was wondrous! I knew that I must pursue the [[divide by zero|impossibility]] with all the will I could bear, for I had nothing else to live for but a bleak expanse, without meaning, without purpose, to mull through my short life, and I no longer had the motivation to look.

You were a beacon against my sorrows, and the world turned as you returned my feelings. I was not weighed down by the sun in the day and the shadows at night. I floated on top of a cloud, I felt that I could do anything, that I would do anything, so long as I could be by your side. Even if the feeling would not last, I had been given something to hope for, something that had never been there before, something I thought never could be there.

[[emo|But all good things must crash down around me.]]

The woman who loved me vanished.

She was an [[mai waifu|illusion]].

I did not fall in love with the Meagan who was addled. 
I fell in love with the Meagan who listens and considers my thoughts, 
whose voice is lyrical and soft, whose eyes hold mystery and cunning, 
who is just a little shy, like me, and whose caustic wit cuts to the bone. 
It is the greatest regret in my life that I could not know you well enough 
to see that you changed, and that I chased after only a shadow of the real you.

I must repay you for the favor you have granted me, and that
is why [[I came|I have come]]. I want to give you some small measure of
the joys I have experienced over the past two months and perhaps
to give you a renewed perspective, as you gave me. It is my
greatest hope that you may love, as I have, and that we can build what was illusion in reality.

On July 1st, Faust had decided to [[idiot|spend CA$170 on alcohol]]. Keep in mind, this purchase was made through hotel room service, so this ended up totaling in a cheap bottle of champagne and two Mike's Hard Lemonades. Using his supposed drunkenness level as an excuse, he was seen [[butthurt|bawwing]] on IRC all night. At least one user was telling him to kill himself for being attracted to someone so visibly hideous while another was [[troll|helping him through the rough emotional situation]].

==Shit got [[serious]]==

{{quote|1=I am not going to be mean-spirited about this. Why don't you call and convince me not to provide your documentation to ED? I am willing to listen to an apology for giving out my personal information, if it is really heartfelt.|2=[http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=User_talk%3APory&diff=1998493966&oldid=1998490479 Faust tries to reopen the lines of communication]}}

Little do they both know that Pory's [[dox]] are incredibly easy to find, and so is a pic of her that is semi-[[fap]]able.  Faust fails to recognise the oh so cliched cliches:  "If you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves first," and "revenge is a dish best served cold."  If you're a true badass, you'll dose your ex-honey with revenge galore without warning, including telling her neighbours about the amateur strip club contest she was involved in.  If you're a pussy, you'll extort.

==TL;DR==

'''This is what Faust expected to find when he met Pory IRL:'''

{{quote|As Pory looked up with glazed eyes, full of uncertainty and fear, Faust grabbed the back of her head and glared at her with a look of anger. "Swallow it, you little slut" he said with a certain sadistic grin. "Take every inch of my cock and don't stop until you are told". "It's all you are good for, anyway". Pory began to tear up and reluctantly opened her mouth, feeling the warm and pulsating cock quiver on the tip of her tongue.|}}
