The United States Bureau of '''Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms''' (and [[Chicken]]) aka [[NAMBLA]], is an altruistic government <s>organization devoted to making sure every black person in America has a cold [[40]] of malt liquor, a packet of [[Newport]]s and an [[AK47]] as dictated by the [[Bill of Rights]] of the United States of Amerikkka.</s> Get it right, That's [[SAMCRO|SAMCRO's]] Job. They control alcohol, tobacco, and firearms so its common knowledge that the <s>ladies</s> [[Trap|Traps]] and [[Sick Fuck|Sick Fucks]] fucking love them.

<s>Attached to black community organisations like [[ACORN]] they go around the country like benevolent Santas in trains leaving boxcars full of gats, smokes and malt liquor open in rail yards for [[crips|community leaders]] to distribute to the [[ghetto]].</s> [[SAMCRO]] has that shit covered as well. 

They ATF also serves in an advisory capacity to organizations -both black and white- who need assistance in arranging [[waco|cookouts]] for the entire neighborhood. 

Since the late 90s, the ATF have been increasingly utilized on a state level in enforcing two drink minimums, [[ladies night]] and smoking bans in the clubs, bars and restaurants that white people frequent. Typically, when called upon, they will swoop in like a [[SWAT]] team and surround a belligerent smoking customer or drunk and set him on fire whilst deafening him with [[death metal]]. Their current leader is <s>[[Trap|Agent June Stahl]]</s> Owned by [[SAMCRO|Opie Winston]] in the Season 3 finale
