After the demise of [[Rickroll]] thanks to [[Fox News|the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], the idiot masses of /b/ created a [[delicious cake]] made of three parts win, two parts [[rage|FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU]], and one part [[Lazy Town| Icelandic loli]]. The resulting abomination is known only as cakeroll.

Cakeroll is truly the next generation in rolling. The Cakeroll has everything a successful roll should have and more. It combines [[delicious cake]] with equally delicious [[lolicon|loli]] and features inspirational lyrics beautifully delivered with soul and passion by world renowned [[Pimp My Ride|negro talent]]. If that's not enough, Cakeroll also features a super catchy tune that will see you coming back again and again for moar of that delicious cake! 

Cakeroll's practical applications include use as a traditional audio/visual style of [[Rickroll|roll]] and as a [[duckroll]] style roll similar to those often encountered on [[Neckbeard|/b/]]. Try Cakeroll today and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!

==Lyrics==
It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake<br>
If the way is hazy,<br>
You gotta do the cooking by the book<br>
You know you can't be lazy<br>
Never use a messy recipe,<br>
The cake will end up crazy<br>
If you do the cooking by the book,<br>
Then you'll have a cake

Break it down bitch, let me see you back it up<br>
Drop that ass down low then pick that motherfucker up<br>
Break it down bitch, let me see you back it up<br>
Drop that ass down low then pick that motherfucker up<br>
Now back that pussy she's a motherfucker<br>
Hey back that pussy she's a motherfucker<br>
Now back that pussy she's a motherfucker<br>
Hey back that pussy she's a motherfucker

It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake (what!?)<br>
If the way is hazy, (okay!)<br>
You gotta do the cooking by the book (what!?)<br>
You know you can't be lazy (yeah!)<br>
Never use a messy recipe, (what!?)<br>
The cake will end up crazy (okay!)<br>
If you do the cooking by the book, (yeah!)<br>
Then you'll have a cake

Rub that shit it's yours bitch,<br>
Grab his dick it's yours bitch<br>
Rub that shit it's yours bitch,<br>
Grab his dick it's yours bitch<br>
Now turn around bitch, put that ass on a nigga<br>
Grind on his dick make it get a little bigger<br>
Now turn around bitch, put that ass on a nigga<br>
Grind on his dick and make it bigger

You gotta do the cooking by the book (yeah!)

==Birdroll==
"Birdroll" originated in the same thread as Cakeroll, but, unlike Cakeroll, it's made of fail. Even though it has SOME lulz in it, Cakeroll has a lot more lulz. I mean, seriously. Birdroll is from a [[Family Guy|Family Guy]] (moar like Family Gay, amirite?) episode, where they sing "Surfing Bird." That should be enough to make you [[DO IT FAGGOT|STAY THE FUCK AWAY]] from it.
