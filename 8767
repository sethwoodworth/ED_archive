Vapid twat
Less friendly than [[twit]], more friendly than [[cunt]], '''vapid twat''' is used with great enthusiasm in [[OL]] conversation to denote a particularly brainless [[vagina]]-bearer.

*[http://www.livejournal.com/users/paigegirl/170238.html?replyto=622846 Scientific inquiry] - [[Poloemily]] to Smileyme: "Why is that vapid little twat still allowed to breathe my air?"
*[http://www.thetimesherald.com/entertainment/blogs/rumble/2006/02/vegas-part-2-tale-of-two-bachelor.html In memoirs] - "When I asked her if she was a vapid twat in college, she answered that she had been too drunk to be vapid."
*[http://www.idontlikeyouinthatway.com/2006/02/paris-hilton-is-really-this-stupid.html Comparing celebrities] - "I have zero doubt that Charlize Theron blows farts with more acting talent than Paris Hilton. She could eat a bowl of suaerkraut, chase it with a six-pack of warm [[beer]], ride a wonky rollercoaster and STILL maintain a higher level of grace and dignity than that vapid twat."
*[http://ilyka.mu.nu/archives/112806.html Sharing TV favorites] - "We will not discuss the time I suffered through ''Tommy Lee Goes to College'', except to say that compared to ''Hogan Knows Best'', it is marginally less likely to drive me to [[suicide]]. Tommy Lee, for all his haggard pierced-and-tattooed vileness, has a certain charm, and he does not have a vapid twat of a hyperbreasted daughter a la Hogan."
*[http://www.cruel.com/discuss/archivedMessage.php/104001 Giving lifestyle advice] - "It was there all along, you vapid twat. Trade in that Cellatron 8201, put down the diet Sprite and go out and get a [[job]]."
*[http://blogcritics.org/archives/2003/02/03/191710.php Expressing musical opinion] - "You can't spell. You use [[AOL]]. Avril's songs connect to you because you're a vapid twat, age 12. She hangs out with Kelly Osbourne (yuck). Her snatch reeks like a beach full of dead fish. The labia flap in the wind. I guess her body is alright, I'd lay atop her and slip one into the ol' grease purse if I were drunk."
*[http://www.tashitagg.com/tar6/claudia/eps09.asp When addressing royalty] - "Princess, I know your hectic schedule of photo shoots and bikini waxes keeps you from doing such things as reading, but no-one - barring a few new age nuts and [[hippies]] - wants to be [[poor]]. Poverty's not a lifestyle choice, you vapid twat."
