'''[http://www.bulbagarden.net/ Bulbagarden]''', or '''[[raep|Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden]]''' is an online [[orgy|community]] of [[faggots|pokemon fans]]. It was founded by hardcore [[World of Warcraft|Elf fetishist]] [[basement dweller|Chris Kaleiki]] in 2001. It is named after the Pokemon [[anime]] episode in which [[homo|Ash]] once again fails to [[rape|evolve]] one of his Pokemon. [[ epic win|Bulbagarden went down soon after it was started]], and Chris Kaleiki moved on to [[lie|better]] [[World of Warcraft|things]]. [[Australian]] [[fanboy]] Liam Pomfret (aka [[Old|Archaic]]) later acquired Bulbagarden and relaunched it in 2002, starting a neverending [[war]] with [[gay|Serebii]]. Bulbagarden currently hosts several [[wikis]], a [[forum]], and an [[DeviantArt|art gallery]].  By incorporating these features, Bulbagarden hopes to become the premier internet destination for poké-fapping [[wapanese|weeabo]] [[furfags]] such as [[you]].

===Bulbapedia===

'''Bulbapedia''' is the [[obese|largest]] and most well-known facet of Bulbagarden.  It is said to be the internet's most comprehensive English-language Pokémon encyclopedia, an extremely [[shit_nobody_cares_about|dubious honor]]. Bulbapedia uses notoriously resource-consuming [[MediaWiki]] software; as a consequence, the site is always [[slowpoke|slow]], and frequently 504s.  In addition to its system resource constraints, Bulbapedia continues to only offer information about Pokemon, making it about as useful as a [[fleshlight]] [[epic win|stuffed with glass shards]] for any [[oldfag|adult]] with an ounce of self respect. 

Bulbapedia was created [[Last Thursday]]. However, due to the [[faggotry|amount of games, the amount of Pokemon anime seasons and episodes, and the amount of obsessed Pokemon fans]], the wiki expanded within a few short months to contain thousands of articles. 

Unlike [[Wikipedia]], Bulbapedia is actually colorful and pretty. Instead of using [[Boring|plain, old, colorless]] templates, Bulbapedia uses colorful templates with [[web_2.0|rounded corners]]. Bulbapedia displays a mastery of wikitext, [[HTML]], and [[CSS]].

Since Bulbapedia is so slow, users are only allowed to edit their user pages once a day. You also can't create or edit user pages until you've logged a certain amount of edits and time there. These are supposed to prevent Bulbapedia from becoming slower. Editing your user page more than a few times a day will result in having your user page locked from editing and a warning on your talk page:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">Due to the current situation with Bulbagarden's [[shit|server network]], as explained in the [http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bulbapedia:Messages_from_the_Editor Messages from the Editor], userspace editing is strictly limited to '''one edit per day'''. As you have made '''X''' userspace edits today, your userpage has been protected for <span title="One day per edit over the limit" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted #000;">X-1 days</span>.</blockquote>

[[Ironically]], locking the page adds another edit to the user page.

Every time there's major hype within the problem community (eg. a new Pokemon game is announced), Bulbapedia suffers from severe server lag due to the [[weeaboos]] flooding in. Complete shutdowns occurred during the hype of the HeartGold and SoulSilver and Black and White. Since each game is basically released twice (one Japanese version and one English version), Bulbapedia has to experience downtime [[twice]] for each new game.

It should also be noted that Bulbapedia glorifies vandals and trolls with special article (eg. [http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bulbapedia:The_Great_Bulbapedia_Turkey_Shoot The Great Bulbapedia Turkey Shoot]), so if you troll hard enough, you might receive a special honor. Please note excessive vandalism by one person at a two year old computer can shut down the site for upwards of a week, so this opportunity is available to even the lowliest [[EDiot]]. Uploading goatse under "Hello.jpg" to the archives no longer works as it is a protected create page, however they love tubgirl. They really love tubgirl.

===Bulbanews===
'''[http://www.bulbagarden.net/ Bulbanews]''' is Bulbagarden's version of Wikinews. It is still uncertain why anyone would use [[MediaWiki]] software for a news blog, but they do it anyway. Bulbagarden's fans whine anyway whenever a news story is posted that isn't [[porn|relevant to their interests]], and practically one person has been posting all news stories [[tomorrow|three days later]] than everyone else.

===Bulbagarden Archives===
The '''[http://archives.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page Bulbagarden Archives]''' is Bulbagarden's version of the [[Wikimedia Commons]]. This is where Bulbagarden hosts most of their files and images.
[[File:Archives.jpg|thumb| With 49,845 uploaded files!!!!11]]

===BMGf===
The '''[http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/ Bulbagarden Forums]''', or '''BMGf''', is where all of the bulbavirgins hang out and chat. It runs on vBulletin software, and it appears to feature Gym leader Erika as its mascot. It contains many forums and subforums, including some on the [[games]], the [[Yugioh|trading cards]], the [[animu|anime]], the [[wikis]], and [[roleplaying]]. [[Shipping]] is one of the forum's most popular topics.

===Bulbagarden Gallery===
The '''Bulbagarden Gallery''' is where the forum-goers post their fan-art. It uses vBulletin forum software and PhotoPost file-sharing software.

===Bulbagarden RPGwiki===
The '''Bulbagarden RPGwiki''' is a wiki for a [[Elite|select few]]. It's supposed to be about documenting the forum's [[roleplaying]] threads, but it hasn't [[virgin|seen much action]] since 2005, when the other wikis were established. Unlike the other sections of the site, it just uses the Bulbapedia logo with different text below it; a pinnacle of [[Mexicans|laziness]].

===Bulbagarden Okeki===
The '''[http://oekaki.bulbagarden.net/ Bulbagarden Okeki]''' is where [[faggots|community members]] post their [[shit|fan-art]] for [[noone|everyone]] to see. It supports the [[addiction|needs]] of [[Autistic|obsessive]] [[Pokemon]] [[faggots|fan-artists.]][[File:oekaki.jpg|thumb| The Members here are very intelligent]]
