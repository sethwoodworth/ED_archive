Dental Plan
Dental Plan is a [[old]] [[forced meme]] spammed [[at least 100]] times [[last Thursday]] starring Lenny from The Simpsons.

== Meme Background ==

Apparently completely '''pointless''' [[meme]] from the good ol' boys of [[meme]], [[4Chan]]. Originating from the ''[[Simpsons]]'' episode "'''Last Exit To Springfield'''". It works in a call-and-response format, whereby [[Anonymous]] posts the following image:

[[Image:liseneedsbraces.jpg|thumb|center|The meek shall inherit the '''Earth'''....]]

And another, equally sexually-desperate [[Anonymous]] replies with this:

[[Image:DENTALPLAN.jpg|thumb|center|...while everybody else gets [[Diabeetus]].]]

The alleged [[lulz]] comes from the fact that during this particular ''[[Simpsons]]'' episode, Mr Burns attempts to revoke the aforementioned '''Dental Plan''' from the power plant worker's union contract, and, after all, "Lisa needs braces" like every good [[16-year-old girl]] does. Jagged teeth have been known to damage teh [[cock]]. The sheer amount that this verbal exchange enjoys during the show is what the [[4Chan]] faithful are emulating.

Remember, these people are our future, and will be running Congress and doling out large wads of cash to the '''military''' with gay '''abandon''', very, '''VERY''', soon. They'd probably run rings around Tom De Lay.

=== Postscript ===

For complete and utter fail, post [[Milhouse]] instead. Angels will be swooning up on high, offering you Golden Showers forever more (i.e. it's not a [[meme]]).
