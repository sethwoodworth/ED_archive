Bookmark
[[File:Dickmark.jpg|thumb|An ancient bookmark.]] A '''bookmark''' is a placeholder you can use to track pages you have visited on the [[Internet|Web]]. It was originally used for [[irl|real]] books, but who knows how to use those any more?

==Uses of bookmarks==
Bookmarks have three uses:
:
:1. Quick access to [[deviantart|pages you visit frequently]].
:2. A reminder for things you [[Lie|claim]] to want to read later.
:3. Remembering that particularly [[tl;dr|long]] [[Porn|pr0nz]] URL, and disguising it as an annotated guide to Mozart.

IRL bookmarks have no use. IRL Bookmarks are a useless gift you can make out of practically anything, thus negating any need someone could have for one.  See also paperweights and doorstops.

==[[IRL]] bookmark (deprecated)==
[[At least 100 years ago]], '''bookmark''' meant:
:Something placed in a [[Old media|book]] to guide in finding a particular page or passage; also, a label in a book to designate the  owner; a bookplate.
This usage was phased out by Congress in [[2006]], since they've stopped using [[IRL]] bookmarks in favor of simply [[Mark Foley|bending over the pages]].
