[[Image:Kagome DemonFuck.jpg||thumb|A typical fight scene between Kagome and a demon.]]

==Plot Synopsis==
[[Image:InuyashaXSesshomaru Collab by CarSoda.jpg|thumb|Inuyasha and Sesshoumaru are fierce rivals.]]
Most of the beginning episodes revolve around [[Inuyasha|the title character]] trying to hunt down his ex-girlfriend's corpse so he can fuck it. Kagome is all cool with this because IRL, nobody really likes her, which is the main reason she has furfags, perverts, whiny sluts and animals for friends. She has no life. For the rest of the series Kagome gets in trouble prompting her to yell "INUYAAASHAAAAA", to which he replies "KAGOOMEEEEEEE" (sometimes it's the other way around, and happens [[at least 100|over 50]] times an episode) and there's a bunch of stupid fights which they lose. Nothing ever happens. It has been proved that only [[sick fucks]] watch this anime, because they hope someday Kagome's mini-skirt will show her [[pantyshot|panties]] or her vagina. This has been confirmed by pedophiles who like to believe that Kagome is just a tall (really fucking tall) [[12 year old girl]] who happens to be a [[bestiality|zoophiliac]] also.

Sometimes, the plot changes to center around Inuyasha's cross-dressing [[pedophile]] older brother Sesshomaru at [[random]] moments. The only reason he's probably around at all is because [[yaoi]] [[fangirls]] think he's hot, and often write [[incestuous]] [[fanfic]]s involving him and Inuyasha. Sesshomaru is also accompanied by a token loli to appease the pedos, and to satisfy his own pedo desires when the show isn't revolved around him.

== Characters ==

TL;DR: [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|Over 9,000 other characters]]''': [[Shit nobody cares about|They're so interesting that you should already know about them by now!]] 
<div style="height:300px; overflow:scroll;">
*'''[[Furry|Inuyasha]]''' (Pronounced as "In-your-washer"): Typical [[butthurt]] hero. He's [[Obama|half-demon]] because his mom was constantly [[whore|whoring]] herself out to all the [[furries]] in town, thus, he was born with cat ears (no, they don't look like dog ears at all). He got pinned to a tree for [[over 9000]] years by a single arrow, because he [[fail]]s just that hard. He's constantly bitching because he loves two different girls, despite the fact that THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME FUCKING GIRL, and that he's a frickin' demon, and therefore could just [[rape|take any pussy he wants]]. He's got a [[penis|sword that grows when you hold it complete with a furry hilt]]. Inuyasha's main goal is to yiff with both the corpse and the schoolgirl (which both are the same chick somehow).

*''' [[16-year-old girl|Kagome]] ''': A clone of Kikyo who likes torturing Inuyasha, getting kidnapped [[at least 100 times]] and saying she's not Kikyo. If she just said "YES, I AM KIKYO." and the [[over 9000|2,042,904,209]] episode series would have never existed, saving humanity. In combat, she basically stands around saying "EENOOYAASHAA" over and over, and can very rarely be seen shooting magical arrows from her vagina which never have any effect. She goes back and forth through time by going through a [[The Ring|magical well]] that only her and Inuyasha can use for no explained reason. Apparently there wasn't enough room for plot in 558 fucking chapters.

*''' [[Derp|Kikyo]] ''': A dead chick made of clay who used to be some [[Wicca|magical priestess]] but now is just a zombie who falls off cliffs and eats souls. Inuyasha and Naraku both want her [[hot]], [[necrophilia|decaying ass]], even though she wants to kill them both. She's emo, as throughout the series when she's alive (she dies like 500 fucking times), she just walks around [[stoned|looking at shit and not talking]].

*''' [[Pervert|Miroku]] ''': Every guy on /b/, he will fuck anything with tits and has a hole in his hand so he can go fuck himself, too. Only exists to provide the standard [[animu]] pervert jokes. Has some story or origin or some shit. He gets raped in the ass if any of Naraku's stupid little bug things get sucked into his [[Goatse|black hole]]; which is strange because nothing else he sucks into it ever affects him in any way, spare one time when another bunch of pointless episodes needed an excuse to be made. Did someone say convenient plot device?

*''' [[VenomFangX|Sango]] ''': A brunette dominatrix who tries everything to [[The Rapture|save her own 11 year old brother]]. She wants cock but hides it by raping her pet cat/fox-thing, Kirara, when nobody is looking. She agrees to live with Miroku later even though he didn't agree to stop fondling other women, and afterwards still won't let him grope her ass like the [[cocktease]] she is. Miroku later turns her into a baby farm. What a healthy relationship. She uses a giant [[tampon]] in battle, and refuses to attack with it unless she can shriek "[[moonspeak|HIRAIKOETZ]]" at the top of her lungs; which of course makes for a stealthy attack. She is as useless in combat as Kagome, but is marginally hotter with a greater ass and allows for threesomes in fanfiction.

*''' [[shota|Shippo]] ''': A [[Rupert Murdoch|fox demon]] who is always wanting yiff from a  "[[loli|human female]]." He's fucking useless and his only power is turning into a [[mushroom]] or a pink balloon thing and getting lolis to ride his ten-year-old cock. He constantly bitches about everything and everyone, despite the fact that he literally does nothing for the group.

*''' [[emo|Sesshomaru]] ''': Inuyasha's incredibly boring, [[crossdressing]] older brother. Primary source of InuYasha [[fantard|fangirl]] orgasms. He spends his time having [[dick|sword]]-waving contests with Inuyasha (he loses almost every time), moping that "[[buttsecks|daddy didn't love him enough]]" and fucking the [[children|six year old girl]] that follows him around. He seems withdrawn and quiet, but is in fact borderline retarded.

*''' [[Yoda|Jaken]] ''': Sesshomaru's pet Jew. He resembles the unholy offspring of a Smurf and a Battletoad. He just runs around not doing anything, like most of the characters in the the series.

*''' [[Lolita|Rin]] ''': Annoying little girl who follows Sesshoumaru and won't [[STFU|shut the fuck up]] after she decides to stop being [[asspie|mute.]] Her purpose in plot is predictably nil, except for a few times where she's predictably kidnapped.

*''' [[Mary Sue|Koga]] ''': A furfag [[wolf]] that wants [[Lie|Kagome's little virgin ass]] but in truth, he just wants to get a good [[fisting]] from Inuyasha. [[Red Indians|Last of his tribe]], [[Bubba|pack alpha]], [[Seinfeld|yada yada yada...]] He is constantly butthurt about everything and is never seen without his inbred rape slaves.

*''' [[pedophile|Naraku]] ''': Ancient Japan's Michael Jackson complete with [[loli]] army. [http://img16.onemanga.com/mangas/00000058/00000502/06.jpg Also luvs eyerape] His purpose in the plot is to lead the protagonists on an excessively long journey in order to reach him, spam them with demons and other pisspoor villains no one cares about, fight them till he is nearly dead (if they aren't fighting another of the [[sockpuppets]] he constantly shits out), and then fuck off someplace else. Rinse and repeat for entire series plz.

*''' [[shotacon|Kohaku]] ''': Sango's little [[retard|"special"]] brother. He dies near the beginning but gets brought back by Naraku (also a famous Necrophiliac) as a zombeh!! He spends the entire show drooling and doing a whole lot of NOTHING. Everyone knows the only reason he's there is to appease the dangerously [[Republican|boy-hungry]] [[pedophile|pedo]] masses.

*'''[[Retard|Kanna]]''': Albino loli who says like 3 words during the entire series. She has a gay little mirror that allows her to watch porn or some shit. Naraku spawned her, probably by fucking a soft serve machine. Her name translated means "duck shit."

*''' [[LSD|Kagura]] ''': Some dumb whore who was spawned after Kanna. She uses her fan to direct her [[queef|flatulence]] at her foes, and is notable as the only character in the series who both participated in combat and had plot relevance. She gets a [[boner]] for Sesshoumaru but gets [[cockblock|rejected]] and refuses to let Naraku rape her, so he pwns her and she deflates or some shit, thus ending possibly the only piece of interesting plot present during the series.

*''' [[Old|Kaede]] ''': Kikyo's sister, and [[lemon party|great in bed]]. Her role in the series is to be a whiny old whore and little else. Spams "ye" and "yonder" in EVERY FUCKING SENTENCE.

*'''[[Hippy|Totosai]]''': Some creepy old fart who is always on [[meth]] and [[LOLWUT|flies around on a three-eyed bull]]. He created Inuyasha's sword with his mighty [[banhammer]].

====The Band of Seven====
The Band of [[7 Proxies|Seven]] is noted as the only season where the episodes had a linear [[fap|plot line]] instead of the usual two [[faggotry|filler episodes, something plot related, two more filler episodes, rinse and repeat]]. Basically, a band of rapists who died [[at least 100 years ago]] were resurrected by Naraku [[last Thursday]] so he could have a [[bukkake|necrophilic orgy]], which he intended to have on top of a magical mountain with a l337 shield hack. This plan [[fail|backfired]] however, as Eeeenoooyaaaashaaaaaa and his merry band of [[goatse|filler characters]] managed to [[troll]] them all to death, which is not very impressive considering several members were quite obviously [[retarded]] (this applies to both the Band and Inuyasha's entourage).

*'''[[furfag|Kyokotsu]]''' - Giant tree-thing whose weapon is a huge [[anal]] bead on a string. He is a closet furry and tried to yiff the wolf demons, but Koga showed up and gave him [[AIDS]]. 

*'''[[fag|Jakotsu]]''' - A [[fucktard|slightly retarded]] [[tranny]] who faps whenever he sees Inuyasha. His weapon is an infinitely long dildo which he uses to raep people during unnecessarily long battles. He dies when Renkotsu [[rape|penetrates]] his flesh and steals his [[virginity|jewel]], much to the [[BAWWWW]] of fangirls everywhere.

*'''[[rapist|Mukotsu]]''' - Drug-addled stumpy little fuck. His weapon is [[weed|bong smoke]], but Sesshoumaru, not one to give into peer-pressure, is [[straight edge]] and says [[NO U|NO]]. Tries to rape Kagome (no, [[rly]]) but forces Sesshoumaru to kill him when he spies Kagome's [[trap|cunningly-concealed penis]].

*'''[[pyro|Renkotsu]]''' - Severely [[Aspergers]] [[India|Hare Krishna]] who likes [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|burning things]]. Was able to make Ginkotsu into a [[hugbox|tank]] despite the time frame for the show being somewhere in the Middle Ages. Gets killed by Bankotsu for killing his [[asshole|butt-buddy]].

*'''[[Mecha-Hitler|Ginkotsu]]''' - Some kind of cyborg/tank with [[Down Syndrome]], his weaponry consists of various S+M toys concealed about his person. 

*'''[[pedobear|Suikotsu]]''' - Lazy plagiarism of [[Wolverine]]. He apparently loves himself soem [[loli]]. Has two personalities, but both of them love the [[CP]], the personality change just denotes his fetishes, as regular Suikotsu prefers [[guro]].

*'''[[SO cash|Bankotsu]]''' - Fag with an irritating voice; is the leader of the Band (because he's the one with the biggest [[cock|sword]]) and fights with a huge metallic [[penis]]. Is predictably killed by Inuyasha, most likely [[lol|yiffed to death]].
</div>

==Movies & Other Stuff==
[[Image:102 Sesshoumarus.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The first movie.]]
There was an ''Inuyasha'' [[porn|movie]] based around his past experiences and failures in his childhood. 

His [[whore|mother]] was a closet-furry that [[beastiality|yiffed]] with [[Advice Dog|Inuyasha's dad]] and got impregnated when the [[lolwut|condom broke]]. The local populace was [[RAGE|angry about this]] as furries should not reproduce and arranged a mob to kill the [[furfag]] and his [[bitch|mistress]]. Unfortunately, his mother and Inuyasha survived and lived like every other family in plot-contrived animu.

All the other movies are about Inuyasha fighting OTHER demons that never [[die]], eternally [[goatse|stretching out]] this lovely heap of [[shit|action]] while generating more plastic crap for [[otaku]] to buy.

As a sad point of reference, they [[fail|never actually finished covering the manga]]. This means that, according to [http://chartfag.wordpress.com Chartfag], another series of Inuyasha will be airing soon... and that means more movies, [[plastic crap]] and [[furry]] [[raeg]] are on the way as well.

==Inu Yasha Fandom==
[[Image:InuyashaDance.gif|thumb|Speaks for itself.]]
[[Image:Inu4.jpg|thumb|A combination of animu cosplay and a fatal case of [[internet disease]] and [[furry|fur faggotry]].]]
Most of the fans that like ''Inuyasha'' are [[fail|awesome]] like ''Inuyasha'' too, seeing as they spend most of their time watching  ''Inuyasha'' posters and spamming animu forums with [[yaoi]] fanfics that are filled with exclamation points and fail. Most of them are [[otherkin]] and cosplay anything with dog or [[cat]] ears, even if it's a plot of steamy [[shit]]. 

'''Example fan:'''
/b/, [[tl;dr|I think Inuyasha is a great show. It is definitely the best anime to come out of Japan in the last 10 years. I don't see why everyone bad mouths it so much. It doesn't deserve ANY of the hate it gets. It has undisputedly the greatest romance in anime history- Inuyasha and Kagome's love has touched my heart on numerous occasions. Inuyasha's struggle to cope with the death of his previous love Kikyo adds immeasurable depth to the story. And the supporting cast is superb. Miroku the lecherous monk is my favorite comic relief character of all time, and he can be serious too! I think it was a VERY courageous decision on the part of Rumiko Takashi to make a lecherous monk character. And Sango's missing brother, so good. And Naraku! Naraku is the best villain EVER. He's so sadistic, evil, and cool. He'll stop at nothing to get those Shikon Jewel Shards. And Sesshomaru. Sesshomaru, is not only the coolest guy in all anime, he's a really deep anti-hero character. But there's one that stands out above all- The Hero. Inuyasha. Inuyasha is my favorite character in anything I've ever watched or read. He can be hillarious, loving and fierce all in one episode. And he's got such beautifully drawn silver locks. And his dog ears are so cute, I just want to rub them everytime I see them. And he has such an awesome robe. And his MC Hammer pants. And his sword is the coolest anime weapon ever, Tetsusaiga! I think the reason that people hate Inuyasha is because it was written by a woman, and they're just sad they'll never write anything as good as Inuyasha]]

Many will post crappy [[YouTube]] tributes (which all have the same overused [[shit]]ty [[fanart]] presented in a [[fail|well-made slideshow]]) or write [[TL;DR]] [[fanfiction]] explaining why Kagome/Kikyo/Sango/Shippo deserves Inuyasha. What they all fail to see is that Inuyasha is probably the least desirable [[furry|personage]] in all of imagination. 

Those who aren't [[fapping|writing]] about which slut should hop on Inuyasha's cock write outlandish non-canonical pairings to [[Mary Sue]]s and bad poetry. Even mentioning the possibility of the opposite pairing than the one suggested will send them into a [[rage]] of bad grammar, noncanon references, [[Shit nobody cares about|and their personal thoughts on the matter]]. 

Although the series has ended, most are unaware of this fact and eventually will lose interest and become obsessed with the latest anime showing on Adult Swim. More is on the way, however, so expect this faggotry to go on forever.

===Incest Obsession===
Every single Inuyasha fan writes these. We don't know why they are so obsessed with it, we think it has something to do with the fact that they are all [[retarded|inbred]] themselves. 

None the less, here is an example....

[[Image:Raylude2.jpg|thumb|A more acceptable [[lesbian|gay]] [[incest]].<br>It's a shame nobody ever writes these.]]
''I expected the pain of his fist when it came, and I was not quick enough to duck, or to run to my mother for protection. He shoved me to the floor, and I could hear my mother's gasp as he shredded my clothing and forced his hips against me, dry mounting me.''

''This sensation...it startled me, and I yipped my distress, whining and crying, though he did not penetrate me. Not then. His hips thrust against my ass over and over again and his hand, with the claws poking the thin skin of my neck held my face to the floor, his body pressed against mine, covering mine. And when he was done humping me I was properly contrite, writhing around on the floor, showing him my belly and neck and groveling for his forgiveness. For his acceptance. His dominance. He ignored me. I had not pleased him enough. But when I tried to rejoin the meal, all it took was a glance and a narrowing of his eyes and I nearly fell to the floor, so fast was my retreat from my chair. I remained, despite my mother's soft voiced protests and coaxing, on the floor for the rest of that meal. He did not always disrobe me, or his own male parts. He did not always become erect. It was never about sex, but [[BDSM|dominance, status and submission.]] Power. He had it, and I submitted to it. The first time he penetrated me, I cried like [[A dog|the pup]] I was. I was far too young for such a thing, but that did not concern my brother at all. He mounted me like a misbehaving [[bitch]] and fucked me hard. I sobbed and begged and bled until he finished and shoved me away. Then I came crawling back, rolling around at his feet and groveling until he allowed me to redeem myself somewhat by cleaning my mess from his cock.''

==Rating==
[[Image:Falling_Darkness_by_FireCatRich.jpg‎|thumb|right|This summarises the series quite well.]]

*''Action'': 4 (They try to cover up lack of plot by having the characters constantly fighting the monster-of-the-week)
*''Lulz'': 3 (5 after you realize the script is mainly "KAGOOOOOOOMEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!" "INUUUYASHAAAAAA!" "KAGOOOMEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!" "INUUUUYASHAAAAA!!!!" sometimes you get a "KIKYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" <s>"INUYASHA!"</s> Kikyo never says anything.)
*''[[faggotry|Furfaggotry]]'': [[Over 9000]]! So much, that one glance at it could explode your head all over the sidewalk outside of the electronics store, and if it doesn't explode your head you will have a sudden craving to go to [[San Francisco]].
*''Guro'': -100. There is no gore, just bones.
