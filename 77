#This is the 3000th Article.
##This article may serve as a punchline for [[e-lawyer]] jokes.
##Punchlines involving this article may be created by adding a new section and filling in the details of the joke there.
###Example: "According to Section 4, Paragraph 2, Sentence 2 of the 3000th Article, you are a [[furry]] and must either pay the furry fine of $286,124 or proceed to the electric chair of your choice for summary destruction."
####In regions where, due to the removal of capital punishment, the actions described in Section 1, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1 are not possible, please report to a vet.
#This is Section 2, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1 of the 3000th Article.
##This is Section 2, Paragraph 2, Sentence 1 of the 3000th Article.
###This is Section 2, Paragraph 2, Sentence 2 of the 3000th Article.
#If you still do not understand the 3000th Article, please [[fellatio|fellate]] me.
#This section contains important laws.
##Like this one.
##Furries are [[sick fucks|fucked in the head]].
###A furry is defined as anyone who thinks they're an animal (note this animal will always be a cute animal. No one is ever a beetle or a pig).
###All furries [[OTI]] shall summararily pay a weekly tax of $286,124. This is referred to as the living tax and if not paid they will be killed.
####An exception will be made for all female furries who have tested negative for [[internet disease]] (approximately 0.001% of all furries). They will merely perform [[fellatio|community service]] once a week. Failure to perform this community service will result in [[Rape|mandatory fines]].
#Following the rule set down by Section 2, Paragraph 2, Sentence 1 of the 3000th Article, this is not Section 2, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1 of the 3000th Article, but rather Section 5, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1 of the 3000th Article. Furthermore, the portion of Section 5, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1 of the 3000th Article following the language "but rather" will be known as Section 5, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1, Clause 1 of the 3000th Article, and so on.
##Based on the rule set down in Section 5, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1 of the 3000th Article, there can be no duplicate Article, Section, Paragraph, Clause combinations which produce the same effectual language.
###Redundency within the 3000th Article is discouraged, except for [[lulz]].
####This extension will be known as Section 5, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1, Clause 2, even though it is headed by a 1.
####This clause does not deserve a name.
#From hence forward, a luser hoping to become an ED [[Special:Listadmins|sysop]] has to beat out [[Goatse|this man]] in the activity portrayed.
##Females are allowed to try to beat [[eelgirl]] in her record of 28 eels.
###Alternatively, females may attempt to outshine [[tubgirl|tubgirl's]] shit parabola.
#Not being here during the creation of this article is grounds to lose sysop.
##Furthermore, all contributing encyclopedia dramatica users should make an attempt to add one clause, sentence, paragraph, or section to the 3000th article.
###All edits to the 3000th Article should be as specific as possible, leaving no extraneous word unturned, unexplored, or unraped.
##Not making edits to the 3000th article constitutes reasonable grounds for
###having the noncontributor's rectum peed in.
###calling the noncontributor a [[scientology]]gist.
####Scientologygist is not a misspelling.
#[[User:Thedreadedkettle]] and [[User:Einsidler]] are, in as few words allowed for 3000th Article use while remaining in complience with Section 7 paragraph 2 sentence 2, [[n00b]]z.
##If you are reading this, YOU are a noob.
#Section 1, Paragraph 1, Article 1 is a lie.
##Section 9, Paragraph 2 states that nothing in the 3000th article is a lie in accordance with Section 10, Paragraph 1.
#Section 9, Paragraph 2 has no idea what the fuck it's talking about
#No part of the 3000th article may be taken out of context, except for  section 7, paragraph 2, sentance 1.
#[[User:Entropy]] must make one (1) addition to the 3000th article stating that [[User:Entropy]] has made one (1) addition to the 3000th article.
#The use of [[old meme]]s is prohibited [[OTI]].
##As used in this section, the term "old" is defined as existing for over 9000 seconds. 
###Section 13, Paragraph 2 of this Article does not violate Section 13 unless you want to be a dick about it. 
##Violators of Section 13, Paragraph 1 are no longer entitled to free [[internets]], even in severe cases of [[Internet Hate Machine|epic win]].
#In Section 1, Paragraph 2, Sentence 1, the term "Jewish", though not actually used, will now be changed to "porchnigger" to encourage [[Holocaust|tolerance]].
