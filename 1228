'''Bunny Pancake''' is a tale about a bunny named '''Oolong''', a [[furfag]] who lived in [[Japan|the land of robots and loli]], who was known for being able to balance stuff, especially pancakes, on his head. 

==Oolong's Life Story==

Oolong was born on July 28, 2004, as a result of leaving a [[Ditto]] with a [[Pikachu]] at the [[pedophilia|Pokemon Daycare]]. He soon left home to escape Farmer [[Grinman]], and moved to Weeabooland in search of his fortune. Unfortunately, he didn't know that rabbit is a delicacy in the Land of Wind and Ghosts, and he was destined for the soup pot until <strike>a kindly spider wove the word "BRILLIANT" into her web</strike> a kindly furry taught him how to put stuff on his head. He began with pancakes, but soon branched out into waffles, Pop Tarts, bagels, and from there into the non-breakfast snack food world.

He died on January 3, [[2007]] ([[nevar forget]]) of [[old]]. He is survived by his common-law wife [[Yuffie bunny]] and 128 children, including [[Ricochet rabbit]] and [[Incontinent Student Bodies|BAWWWW bunny]], both dis[[owned|0wned]].

On internet forums, this is quite possibly the wittiest response ever. Seriously, just go in a random thread and the moment someone says something outside of your sphere of knowledge, just post that picture. [[Newfags]] will love you for it for being the first person to ever post it in history, while [[oldfags]] will be able to easily see [[you]] and everyone you have ever known are irredeemable [[fgt]]s and [[troll|act appropriately]].

==Alternate==

"I have [[wtf|no idea]] what you're talking about. So here's a [[cat|kitty]] that will claw you eyes out for trying to [[pwn|fuck]] with it."

[[cat|Kitty]] who has - debatedly - either a pancake, a pizza, or an [[France|omelet]] on its head.

==Opposite==

"Sadly, I know what you're talking about, so here's a guinea pig with a STFU on its head."

When confronted with massive levels of retardation that attempts to be smart, this is your best line of defense.
