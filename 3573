If you're like us you've probably never wondered what will happen to the [[CryptoKids]] once they've grown up; the answer was always there, their aspie logic would draw them ever-closer to realizing what utter failures they are and they would eventually expunge themselves from existence, hopefully taking out as many people in the process as possible. However, if you ''have'' wondered what comes later in life for a cryptokid, and you guessed "[[basement-dwelling]] [[weeaboo]] [[furries]]", you would be absolutely correct. 

'''Hackerteen''' is this next level in the development of future [[internet superheroes]]. Signing up for Hackerteen is a lot like signing up for summer camp, except turned on its head. In this camp everyone is the pasty computer nerd, physical activity is shunned, and despite the amount of smelly teenagers huddled together for days on end, surprisingly, nobody gets laid (however the camp counselors are said to be similar to regular camp counselors so there may be an exception in your case).

Hackerteen is overseen by 4Linux, and aims to teach the average [[teenager]] how to stay totally hip and edgy when it comes to protecting themselves and the government from the [[internet|forces of evil]]&trade;. This school of thought is a force to be reckoned with, as their hands-on educational process greatly surpasses what one might find in a typical [[CSIII]] class. There is also a [[manga]] that was published in April '08 by [[ORLY|O'Reilly]] (seen on the left) to aid in jumpstarting technology-based consumerism in [[Brazil]] and spread general awareness of the program. Not a shock considering Brazil that the aids appear to be spreading quite easily.

As you can see by the above flow-chart the education basically breaks down into the following paths, translated for your convenience and passed through the [[internet hate machine|inverse-faggotry equation]].

                ------------ [[Anonymous]] ------------ [[Final Boss of the Internet]]
                |
                |
 [[btard]] --------------------- [[Femanon]]
                |
                |
                ------------ [[CSIII]]

As you can clearly see they are pretty srs about transforming your typical wide-eyed dork into a [[bear|grizzly]], broad-shouldered man with long white hair and blue business cards. While the translated model does not result in the teen winding up as a complete [[faggot]], it is only communicated as such to relay more easily understood definitions of what Hackerteen offers in their program, which is to apparently supply old men with nerdy lolis.
