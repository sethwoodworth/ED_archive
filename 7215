Samsara
'''Samsara''' is the 169th [[sockpuppet]] of [[Jacknstock]], who is always getting banned for mod sass since CrayolaCrime banhammered him. This [[Canadian]] fuckwit is prone to starting retarded edit wars with everyone on ED because he is a huge [[butt-hurt]] [[faggot]]. He is incredibly careful with his [[IP address]], utilizing [[proxy|proxies]] to hide his identity, probably because he doesn't want anyone to know he lives in [[New Jersey]], [[OH SHI-]]! After dissing [[loldongs]] on [[ED IRC]], Sammy was banned by [[User:Caelum|Caelum]] in the summer of [[2006]]. He made the accounts [[User:AnHeroIsSpeltWrong]] and [[User:RoundHouseKickToTheFace]] to hide his shame, and edit war with a [[Miltopia|confirmed furry]]. He got banned for being an unrepentant [[drama llama]] and for incorrigible mod sass. 

He edited Wikipedia under the name [[Wikipedia:User:Anomo|Anomo]]. Unsurprisingly, [[Wikipedia]] didn't put up with his bullshit either, and he got pwned by [[Jayjg]] for trying to run [[9000]] socks at [[Wikipedia:Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Anomo|once]]. He tried to nominate [[Gary Weiss]] for adminship [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mantanmoreland&diff=prev&oldid=140998303] but this was detected as trolling and fail. However he should be remembered as being a true martyr for the [[lulz]], for he impersonated the former ED admin [[User:Hardvice]] on TOW [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hardvice], and earned a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive53#.7B.7Buser5.7CHardvice.7D.7D_and_.7B.7Buser5.7CFurryiamIAM.7D.7D community ban] for his good work. (This is identical to a normal ban except with shaming) This was only after he had spammed thousands of emails to various [[bureaucratic fuck]]s, disrupted the amoral ED [[VFD]], and uploaded his mugshot the day after release from [[internet jail]], much to [[MONGO]]'s distress.

Driving on the freeway, John pushed to 95, passed another granny. Now in the left lane, a car was coming up like a brick wall. Time to brake. A quick sweep of lanes dodged the snail. Then changed back to the fast lane and off he went. Zooming by other cars like scenery, the trip kept going.<br /><br />
Rushing by, a sign lowered the speed limit from 65 to 55. 55? John felt it was an insanely low speed for a freeway. Someone should outlaw it. Raise them all to 75. He briefly considered painting a one in front of that number, but he roared by. The sign quickly vanished from his rear view mirror.<br /><br />
Dodging and passing everybody, his car went under an overpass. The event barely registered his consciousness; it went by too quick.<br /><br />
In the car's mirrors, a car raced toward him. Was that another speeder? Maybe someone wants a race. He fingered the button for his nitro.<br /><br />
The speeder behind him gained. John decided to wait until it was beside him before flipping the nitro. Now only a few cars behind, John wondered if it was a taxi. Perhaps some poor sucker was so late that he or she paid a taxi to speed to their destination. Oh no, that thing above the car was not for a taxi.<br /><br />
Suddenly, the advancing car's lights flashed and a siren shrilled. What was he to do? Fingering the nitro, John considered a race.|Samsara|[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/young_writers/ Young Writers] Yahoo Group}}
