'''Ryan Schallenberger''' is the [[epic fail guy]] of [[an hero day]] 2008 who almost committed a school massacre until [[Will Smith|his mom got scared]] and called the [[partyvan]].

His parents called the police after 10 pounds of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer commonly used in the fabrication of bombs,  was delivered to their home in Chesterfield, [[Redneck|South Carolina.]] They also discovered a disturbing journal in which, Ryan whined about his [[rich and beautiful]] classmates and praised the "[[Columbine]] Killers" like a good little [[fanboy]]. 

In his journal, Ryan stated that he wanted to "Blow up the school so he could go to heaven and kill Jesus".

His parents also uncovered over a years worth of plans for the bombing, which were [[surprise|very well thought out]] and could have actually worked. It is yet to be confirmed whether his internet handle is [[User:Pokchu|Pokchu]].

==Weapons of Mass Distruction==
Ryan is now accused of being a [[terrorist]] and could face [[rape|life in prison]].
