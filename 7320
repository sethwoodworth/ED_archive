Sea Kittens
[[Image:Savetheseakittens.jpg|right]]

'''Sea Kittens''' are, as their name suggests, the [[LOLWUT|kittens of the sea]]. They were discovered in [[2008]] by fearless scientists studying dangerous levels of snugglability under high-tension conditions at the University of Wufflesworth. It is believed that the case may have to be referred to [[LHC|CERN]] before these previously unencountered levels of wuffykin can be properly analyzed; in the meantime, theoretical analysts agree that Sea Kittens are likely to be the [[Kawaii|cutest, the OOTEST WOOTEST little things ever discovered]].

==So what ARE "Sea Kittens?"==
[[Image:Faf-sticker.gif|thumb|right|Emo Sea Kitty is saddened by your taste in foods.]]
[[Image:Avatar flounder peta2.gif|thumb|right|Say hello to your new forum avatar.]]
They're fucking [[SEAKING|fish]].

==Wha- Hah- Who Is Responsible?==
[[PETA|Who the fuck do you think?]]

==So, wait...what the fuck?==
Simply put, PETA is running a campaign to discourage [[phishing|fishing]], the [[Animal abuse|mistreatment]] of fish, the [[OM NOM NOM NOM|eating]] of fish, sexual/mental/verbal abuse of fish, [[etc]], complete with [[Internet petition|online petitions]], insane [[propaganda]], and a gross misunderstanding of the topic at hand.  Nothing new there.  

However, what's so [[I'm so confused|confusingly]] hilarious about this particular campaign is PETA's determined refusal to call the fish "fish", and insistence on instead referring to them as "Sea Kittens." To quote:

{{quote|Whoever was in charge of creating a positive image for fish needs to go right back to working on the Britney Spears account and leave our scaly little friends alone. You've done enough damage, buddy. We've got it from here. And we're going to start by retiring the old name for good. When your name can also be used as a verb that means [[Pain Series|driving a hook through your head]], it's time for a serious image makeover. And [[sick fuck|who]] could possibly want to put a hook through a sea kitten?|PETA}}

To further the [[WTF|WTF-ness]] of the situation, the campaign is centered around a [[Toontown|cartoony]] website that appears to be directed at [[children]] and/or [[Asperger's syndrome|developmentally challenged]] adults.  The site contains [[flash]] games, lots of colorful animations, a store to buy Sea Kitten merchandise, and copious amounts of cute, [[Condescension|condescending]] dialogue, making it look more like something you'd expect from a ''Powerpuff Girls'' fansite, rather than a webpage for an anti-fishing campaign.  But you really have to see the site for yourself. Words can only go so far.

And PETA continues to spit in the face of [[Bestiality|zoological science]] by also making up their own characteristics and taxonomy of Sea Kittens, seemingly oblivious to the fact that "Sea Kittens" and house cats are not even closely related in any way, other than both being vertebrates, or that <s>fishing</s> [[wut|kittening]] actually helps keep Sea Kitten populations in balance. Although, Sea Kittens apparently don't mind being dressed up in goofy outfits and made to wear lipstick - just so long as that lipstick wasn't [[hilarious|tested on animals]], that is.

Presently, it is unclear whether PETA are attempting to irreparably damage the minds of [[children]] around the world or are simply trying to wrest the crown of "Most Insane Organization on Earth" from the [[Church of Scientology]] - probably both.

==Actual PETA Quotes==
[[Image:Peta_hates_jews.gif|thumb|right|Proof that PETA hates [[Jews]].]]
{{quote|Contrary to popular belief, the technical term for sea kitten offspring is "baby sea kitties," not "caviar." Many sea kittens build nests where they can raise their baby sea kitties, and others collect small rocks off the sea floor to make widdle hiding pwaces where they can rest.}}

{{quote|Sea kittens talk to each other through squeaks, squeals, and other low-frequency sounds that humans can only hear through special instruments. Most ichthyologists—scientists who specialize in sea kitten biology—agree that this is just about the cutest thing ever.}}

==The Darker Side Of Sea Kittens==
Of course, this wouldn't be a PETA project if, having gotten onto a [[sushi|roll]], they didn't [[fail]] disastrously to see the crash barrier coming, smash straight through and plunge, burning, into the ravine. Once the Sea Kitten fancier is [[pun|hooked]] (so to speak), they are abruptly ripped from their colorful life of sunshine, lollipops and simplistic Flash games and plunged headlong into one [[woman]]'s terrifying and surreal imaginary world.

To date, there have been four Sea Kitten bedtime stories published on the website. Excerpts are reproduced here, but we really, really encourage you to [http://www.peta.org/sea_kittens/book.asp go and look for yourselves] - they're like extremely colorful Nick Cave songs. Besides, perhaps if they get enough hits we'll get [[MOAR|more]]. The world desperately needs to know what the crew of the good shit PETA think about aquariums and goldfish.

{{quote|This is just great. As a baby-eating godless Asian hell-demon, my culinary repertoire was limited to household felines and young humans, but with the renaming of the admirable aquatic animals as sea kittens, now I may enjoy the bounty of the oceans as well!
