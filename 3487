Greg King
[[An hero]] who got busted and maybe is going to jail for more than 100 years for doing DDoS against [[myg0t]], if he happens to be guilty. Also known as SilenZ, SilenZ420 and gregk707. Also allegedly fucked up some 'security' website called 'CastleCops', whatever that is and something called KillaNet.

''Greg King, 21, of Fairfield, Calif., was indicted under seal Sept. 27 and was arrested at his home Oct. 1 after he tried to escape out his back door and hide a computer in the bushes in his yard, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.''

'''"My good friend's ISP shut him over this fucking post, I have the right to be angry. If you edit my post once more, you will be sorry."'''

Said he would stop the DDOS of [[myg0t]] if its admins apologised for "being the asses we are".

'''"My ip does happen to be logged, And u wont do shit. Can u ban me from posting? NOPE and do u know why? [[7_proxies|BECAUSE IT IS DYNAMIC]], anytime i get off the internet it changes. SO ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS FUCK YOU HAVE A NICE DAY."'''
