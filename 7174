SUBTLE HINT ALERT::
[[Image:Thumb ltd a189.gif|thumb|SUBTLE HINT ALERT: [[Pedophile]]]]
*Gay phrase coined by [[fro0tlo0p]] in his many attempts to win [[Victoria4usa]]'s [http://www.livejournal.com/community/justines_world/4991.html heart] such as [http://www.frienditto.com/members/gsrwilliam/users/victoria4usa/7285.html this] or the following:
::"There are some really good psyche facilities you could work in down here in Florida..."

::"::SUBTLE HINT ALERT!"


*Other alerts are sometimes followed with an "I'm just saying" ([http://www.frienditto.com/members/gsrwilliam/users/victoria4usa/7773.htmlXthread=112733#t112733],   [http://www.frienditto.com/members/gsrwilliam/users/victoria4usa/8108.htmlXthread=123564#t123564]).

*It should be noted that this phrase was never used by anyone except bizarre faggot [[fro0tlo0p]]. [[fro0tlo0p]], it should be further noted, grew up to be a page for [[Mark_Foley|mark foley]].
