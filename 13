'''/adv/''' is the Advice board on [[4chan]] populated by [[16 year old girl]]s and [[13 year old boy]]s  pretending to be 16 year old boys seeking dating advice. If you thought '''[[b/|/b/]]''' and '''[[k/|/k/]]''' were bad it gets worse.

== Threads ==

Most threads are questions about relationship advice, that any person not born in [[retard|the South]] could resolve on their own. Such questions may include:

*''What does [[vagina]] feel like?''
*''Did I cross the line raping my girlfriend?''
*''I really like this boy in my class but I'm afraid he'll think I'm [[fact|too fat]]''
*''How do I convince my girlfriend to let me fuck her butt?''
*''I'm in love with this [[Lolicon|loli]] but she's 14 and I'm 22. Do I wait for her?''
*''Should I take my girlfriend to Burger King or McDonald's?''
*''Will my girlfriend find my tranny porn cache creepy?''
*''Is it just one guy posting girls in stockings pictures on /s/ or do boys really like them?''
*''How do I tell my boyfriend I'm [[AIDS|HIV]] positive?''
*''Am I supposed to cuddle with my date?''
*''Do girls like it when I shower daily?''
*''I want to go over to [[Good Korea]] and have sex with all the girls of [[Girls' Generation]] but I don't speak Korean! What should I do?''
*''I want to be a [[shemale|girl]](rarely, OP will want to be a boy), what do?''

For the remaining threads that aren't about relationships, I was just kidding. All threads are about relationships. If you see a thread not about relationships, odds are you're seeing a troll thread.

== What /adv/ is not ==
(Besides a good board, that is.)

[[Newfag]]s occasionally pop in to /adv/ thinking it's [[Anonymous]]' version of [[Yahoo Answers]], only to be told that they're trolling the board by asking questions that require some brainpower.
