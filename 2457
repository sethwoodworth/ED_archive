Dream Theater
[[File:Dtbcsl.jpg|thumb|200px|TOTALLY DARK AND BROOTUL]]
'''Dream Theater''' is a [[Yes|Progressive]] [[Metal]] band from [[New York]], specializing in making [[Dragonforce|long epic guitar solo songs]]. The band started in 1989, disappeared in 1997, then reappeared in 2007 thanks to [[Guitar Hero]]. They are [[sellout]]s, since more than 10 people have heard about them, and they're totally not [[Black metal|br00tul]] according to the Metal world. 
==Band Members==
[[File:Jesuspetrucci.jpg|thumb|John Petrucci]]
===John Petrucci===
[[OMG]] 100% [[THE BEST]] Guitarist ever in the history of forever and secretly Jesus in disguise, according to fans. Writes most of the band's music in order to have the longest possible guitar solo. He also has a [[So_cash/variations/Celebrity_Cash#John_Petrucci_Cash|smokin' hot wife]].
===[[Azn|John Myung]]===
Bassist. Doesn't talk.
===Jordan Rudess===
[[File:Jrwizard.jpg|thumb|[[EDF|R u a wizard?]]]]
A skilled keyboard player and a decent wizard, but he is the most hated member of Dream Theater. Why? Because of the [[Bald|chrome dome?]] Being a Jew? Posting too much on [[YouTube]]? Using [[Apple]] products? His cute fluffy [[kitty]]? No. Because he replaced Kevin [[Moar|Moore]] back in '96, and the fans still haven't gotten over it. According to them Jordan is the worst thing evar in DT, and they should fire him and bring back [[Moar]] so that they can redo Images And Words, despite the fact that [[Moar]] is already in his own band.

===James LaBrie===
''Was'' a great singer until '99, but then he damaged his vocal chords from [[Anorexia|vomiting so much]]. Now he sounds like a cat run over by a motorcycle at live shows. Also he's [[Canadian]].

===Mike [[Porn|Portnoy]]===
Their fat drummer who used to have a drinking habit. Now he has replaced it with a habit of self-promoting in the songs he writes. He wrote [[What|5 fucking 10-minute songs]] about his [[Alcoholics]] [[Anonymous]] crap, and songs about his [[Baw|crappy childhood]] and dead father. After The Rev died, he took his place in [[Gay|Avenged Sevenfold]]. His drumkit is so huge, it has 2 seats (Somewhere along the line he [[fat|grew a second ass]].) and so many cymbals that it resembles a small village in [[Taiwan]]. He wants you to [[Lol|eat his ass and balls]].

'''<big>UPDATE</big>''': On 9/8/10, Mike [http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/Mike-Portnoy-Announces-His-Departure-From-Dream-Theater-22063.aspx announced] that he is [[Done with ED|done with DT]]. Millions of suicides are expected.

==Fans==
Like most bands, it's the rabid fans that give DT a bad name. The fans seem to think that their fandom is far superior to [[Miley Cyrus|other]] [[Justine Bieber|crappy]] [[Jonas Brothers|fandoms]], but when provoked, the fans will react in the same way as the aforementioned 12-year-old girls. Comments of "OMG DREAM THEATER RULZ" and "STFU UR A HATER" litter their Internet existence.

===Trolling DT fans===
*Say that Dragonforce is heavier/better/herman li owns pedochelli
*Say that kirk hammett is more skilled at guitar soloing
*Mention that a video game that insults guitar players is the reason why this band even makes any money
*say that the vocals suck
*say that they are not heavy in the slightest (fans will fight to the death in defense of this)
*Mention that no one listens to them
*Say that petrucelli speeds up his guitar solos via audacity, and that herman ri doesn't
*say that all of the guitar work from petrucelli (solos, leads) is actually all MIDI and that he sucks ass
*ask a fan how many times he (no girls on internet so only he) has heard DT songs on the radio.
*Say that avenged sevenfold and bullet for my valentine are more successful, way better, heavier and have more talented lead guitar players
*Mention that petrucelli is not on the Rolling Stones top 100 best guitarists list.

==Music==
[[File:Count tuscany.jpg|thumb|The Count of Tuscany.]]
The music isn't half bad if you like [[Tl;dr|10+ minute-long]] songs with [[at least 100]] time signature changes per minute.
*Images And Words - [[THE BEST]] album evar, simply because of Kevin Moore.
:*[[No Life|Learning To Live]] - [[Epic|EPIC]] song, because James [[Castration|cuts his balls off]] and hits [[Profanity|F#]] in the middle of the song.
*[[Lie]] - [[Metallica]] cover.
*[[Anal sex|Anna Lee]] - Self-explanatory.
*[[Tool|Home]] - Basically [[Tool]]'s Forty-six and two.
*The Dance of Eternity - OMG SO TECHNICAL [[Over 9000|OVER 9000]] TIME SIGNATURE CHANGES LOL
*A Nightmare to Remember - DT's attempt at death metal. Failed horribly.
*A Rite Of Passage - Proof that they are [[Secret Nazi|Secret]] [[Illuminati]] [[OMG]]
*The Count Of Tuscany - The story of how JP was [[almost raped]] by some dude. An unintentionally lulzy song, due to cheesy lyrics and awkward singing. (srsly, not even [[Jeff Dunham|ventriloquist dummies]] have to say such silly things.)
