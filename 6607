Princess Portal
Princess Portal is a website created by destined Princess Skye. 

Princess Portal is about finding your inner princess or child. Skye gives tips on how to become a character from something like [[Sailor Moon]]. Although princesses never used the internet in any of those books like Cinderella, Snow White, etc, she seems to be unable to live without her frilly pretty pink icons! She also has a flushable toilet to use and running hot water; how can you be a princess without having someone to empty out your shit bucket twice a day?
Thank you, [[Disney]], you sure fill our youth's minds with [[bullshit|well nourished education]]!

{{quote|I quite like this quote from the Wikipedia entry on Princess “Yet another take on the rising popularity of being a “princess” is the gentleness and refined composure associated with the title. It often conjures images of elegance and self-control, and among the younger generations, is a depiction of all things feminine and lovely.” That is very close to the ideal I am describing| Princess Skye, quoting from [[Fail|Wikipedia]]}}

She begins her website by telling the visitor a little about herself, how she never grew up from the fantasy stories written down in Disney books about princesses being saved by princes, witches, dragons and other magical fantasy-based crap. This can be read [http://princessportal.com/ here]. It isn't enough for her to talk about herself for the entire website, so she also requests donations via PayPal by any fans who love to bask in '''not their own''', but '''her''' manure-filled beliefs and so on. 

It's uncertain whether Princess Skye loves attention or just herself, but in some instances it works. She, for some reason, is adored all over the EGL community, it may be due to her large and expensive wardrobe filled with Angelic Pretty and [[BABY, THE STARS SHINE BRIGHT|Baby The Stars Shine Bright]] brand clothing (nothing off-brand, because princesses can't wear anything that doesn't have a minimum $200 price tag). [[Some_argue|Nobody knows]] why, but it is certain that princess Skye's [[Over_9000|ego]] takes over and reigns supreme; some would say she's catching up to [[Kiki Kannibal]].

==People who do not agree with the Holy one==

People who do not usually agree with Princess Skye are dealt with by her clan of [[Bitch|faithful servants]], usually with catty name-calling and [[Drama|dramu]] over the [[Internets]]. Princess Skye simply wants to exercise to right to be [[Butthurt|free]] in her own [[Batshit_insane|state of mind]]. No one is more of a princess than herself. If it weren't illegal, she would probably exercise her right to execute people, even though she was probably born a peasant.

== LiveJournal == 

Having her own LiveJournal, Princess Skye continues to spread her [[Bullshit|royal glory]] to the rest of the EGL community, even moreso the Perth_lolita community, where she moderates. [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|Basically, any Lolita in Perth who has crossed her holy path is to be shunned from the community and has no opportunity to get into it.]] Happy days! Her profile can seen [http://fatalfille.livejournal.com/ here].

In Princess Skye's free time, she enjoys dressing up as [[Animu|animu]] characters at conventions, and also sells a variety of [[Loli|Loliable]] accessories from her mini-store called Petit Miel, [[Lie|at moderate prices]]!
