'''The Homeless''' are a species of sentient, humanoid beings who seek to live a communal life free of modern society's crushing standards and suppressing morals; a society that can freely trade sexual favors for controlled substances, does not poison itself with soap, and prides itself on drinking irresponsibly. They are easily approachable and typically friendly, so ensure that you support their nutrition with donations for [[alcohol]] and [[heroin]]. If you ever feel threatened at all during an encounter, remember that they are quite flammable and also vulnerable to vehicles moving at highway speeds.

== Birth of a Hobo == 
The Homeless spawn from two main locations- Housing Projects and the [[Basement]].  Your standard bum was either born into poverty and was probably a crack baby thanks to the good parenting of the [[ghetto]], or as in the future case of [[you]], was a [[basement dweller]] who spent too much time fapping to [[guro]] on [[/b/]] and was finally kicked out of the house by mom and dad despite the fact that [[/b/tard|after twenty-five years of existance you still haven't developed a single useful life skill]].  Upon hitting the streets the newly formed hobo will blame all of their shortcomings on their [[parents]], their [[pedophile|high school gym teacher]], [[Dubya]], and [[Jesus]], and then promptly develop a harrowing [[crack cocaine]] addiction, thus completing the transformation into a fully fledged bum and ensuring that they will [[oldfag|never be able to rejoin normal society again]].

== How to Spot ==
Hobos are generally fairly easy to spot as are even dirtier than your average [[white trash]]/black person specimen and also smell significantly worse.  They have torn and tattered clothes, huge bushy beards, and bandannas tied in random places all over their body.  Often seen carrying a sign explaining their predicament that [[bullshit|totally has nothing to do with drugs or alcohol]], or more likely, carrying around a brown paper bag with some sort cheap whiskey in it.
