Mark C. Rathbun a.k.a. Marty Rathbun is an ex-<s>con</s> [[scientologist]] with a love for high spirits. Currently unemployed, he is trying to make money as a self-help guru in South Texas.

Arrested July 10, 2010, for being drunk and touching a boy with a ball in New Orleans. Getting arrested for being drunk on Bourbon Street in New Orleans is about like being arrested for streaking at a nude beach! So what did happen? He had just been touching ball(s), he says[http://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/confession/]. The police horse did not like that and pinned him against a wall, he says. Fact is, he got arrested and booked for 14 hours for harassing a tourist and public intoxication.[http://www.scribd.com/doc/34560365/Marty-Rathbun-Mug-Shot-Mark-C-Rathbun] 
Seemingly enjoying his stay, he says later:

Other: Was executive in [[scientology]]. Failed. Loved hitting up friends too much.[http://www.freedommag.org/special-reports/cnn/heres-marty.html]
