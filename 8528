{{quote|Celebs are worse than toddlers when they don't get their way.|Trent's attitude is [http://www.engadget.com/2009/05/07/nin-app-store-update-approved-by-apple nothing new.]  The comments are priceless.}}

'''Trent Reznor''', [[Everyone|frontman, vocalist, guitarist, bassist, keyboard, drums, vuvuzela, sitar, didgeridoo, accordion, maraca, tuba and xylophonist]] for [[Angst|Nine Inch Nails]], more recently [[shit nobody cares about|How To Destroy Angels]], and [[Snapesnogger|Severus Snape]] impersonator for [[Pedophile|children's birthday parties]], is a pioneer and role model to [[faggoth]]s everywhere. Since the late 1980s Trent has been putting out [[Emo|angst ridden music]] for [[teenager]]s to [[Self Injury|cut themselves]] to. However, in the [[web 2.0]] era of the 2000s, Trent has found something even more dark and disturbing: [[Social Networking]].

==Twitter Crap==

Despite being the icon of thousand of [[gothic]] [[fag]]s throughout the world for the better part of 20 years, Trent has recently found himself a place as one of the more notable [[troll]]s on [[Twitter]]. Here is a quote directed at former Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman Chris Cornell, a fellow tweeter:

{{quote|You know that feeling you get when [[Chris-chan|somebody embarrasses themselves so badly YOU feel uncomfortable?]] Heard Chris Cornell’s record? Jesus|Trent - ''telling it like it is.''}}

===The AngieZ. Story===
Sometime in early may 2009, a blogger from Massachusetts named Angela L. Zajac made the mistake of @messaging Trent just after he had received a crushing blow from [[Apple]] telling him that his [[Sarcasm|long anticipated]] [[iPhone]] application had been rejected due to ''[[Rape|controversial]]'' content. That content being ''The Downward Spiral'', Nine Inch Nails' 1994 album that included the song "Closer", which is widely known for its chorus, "'' [[Furries|I want to fuck you like an animal]]''".

{{quote|Trent, I love your music. You tweet some funny things! But that was just not a good move. You just got passed that iPhone thing. Were you drunk tweeting?|[http://twitter.com/angiezherself @AngieZherself]}}

{{quote|Perfect example of the kind of complete parasitic delusional asshole that makes you regret fame: @AngieZherself|[http://twitter.com/trent_reznor @trent_reznor]}}

Obviously, calling a devoted fan a "parasitic delusional asshole" after she asked a simple question was not enough. Trent then showed his prowess as an [[E-detective]] by dropping [[dox]] on the bitch on Twitter. Yes, this really happened.

==LOL Disregard, [[twat|AngieZ]] is a [[twat]]!!==


[[Image:Exploi1.jpg‎|thumb|AngieZ trying to entice Trent]] 


Much evidence has been shown in the coming days of why Trent Reznor in fact freaked out on [[twat|AngieZ]], it has been shown that indeed it wasn't for the small little comment that she made about the iPhone app. Being denied. No, it's a fact that she's actually probably a typical crazed NIN fan herself who was [[butthurt]] cuz Trent was getting engaged...! ZOMG!!


{{quote|I've accepted the fact that they are getting married, I just think it's absurd.
|AngieZ bawwing over the fact that Trent doesn't want to put his cock in her mud-hole.}}


It's hard to tell where it started and where it ended. It seems that either [[twat|AngieZ]] a delusional [[16-year old girl]] who was butt-hurt because she didn't win her NIN tickets OR she's a whiny [[13-year old boy]] who was [[butt-hurt]] because Trent didn't want to marry her, either way BAAAAAAAW!

Much evidence is shown to support this up, not only that but in [[twat|AngieZ]] blog she [[Delete_fucking_everything|BALETTED FUCKING EVERYTHING]] because she was so butt hurt from her own anal raping she was afraid that the prolapse of people who have brains would come in and not sign up to her shitty blog website, which is proof with the link below which shows no links not even if you sign up. LOL. If there was more truth to this, why isn't the entry still there?

==Jew vs. [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|No one]]==

Jew is [[twat|AngieZ]] possible cock whore. The site which they use for the blog is the same, not only that but Jew seems to think that Trent Reznor is somehow butting heads with him. It was actually shown however Fred just wanted to push his new line of @ Jew vs. @trentreznor t-shirts. LOL wut? Thus destroying any credibility he had (if any).

Jew was [[butthurt]] because helping out Eric (who was in dire need of a transplant, which Trent help to raise in a total of 750 000 dollars), was a PR stunt. This is true because Trent didn't have to do fuck all for him if he wanted to. Or was Jew butt-hurt because Eric's sister seemed to be promoting socialized health care?


{{quote|Her strongest argument was that our health care system is flawed. I agree, but I have health insurance and I do not have any preexisting conditions. Does she really expect us to switch to socialized medical care?|Jew, [[republican|Champion of the people]]!}}


[[Image:Freetshits.JPG‎|thumb|[[Chinese]] proverb say, buy t-shirt now, high quality!]]


Was Trent helping out Eric a PR Stunt? Is he in fact trying to get health care to be covered for everyone and turn it into a communist society? Does Trent REALLY have a 7.5 inch penis?! It seems like Jew did indeed do it for principles! Because this is [America] and he is against censorship, and free health care!! It seems like he may not have only done it for lulz but also free <s>t-shits</s> t-shirts. Buy them!! Very high quality!!


==Quitting The Internet forever==

[[Image:Nincash.jpg|thumb|You know you have no talent when some old dirtbag can sing and play your own songs better than you can.  This photo comment is [[So cash|SO CASH]].]]

As of Mid June 2009, Trent Reznor is officially [[Done with ED|done with social networking]]. We have heard a lot of [[junkees|people]] say this before. We will have to wait and see.

{{quote|I will be tuning out of the social networking sites because at the end of the day it's now doing more harm than good in the bigger picture and [[It_was_a_social_experiment|the experiment seems to have yielded a result]]. Idiots rule.|Trent Reznor - ''Just now figuring out that 99% of the world is idiots''}}

{{quote|I [[Do_not_want|do not want]] this.|Trent Reznor - ''About to be told how to feel''}}

However, it seems that he has a new twitter account named @halo7557 because he can't stop defending his [[cumdumpster|fiance]].

==Fallout and Aftermath==

[[Image:Ninsnapeharry.jpg|thumb|Pay no attention to the internet or the people who are picking on me...]]

Trent may have quit the [[internet]] forever, but it seems that forever is quite a short amount of time. On June 11, he was seen on the [[Shit nobody cares about|NIN messageboard]] trying to explain that when he calls people "[[fatty|plump losers]]" he [[Liar|doesn't really mean that in a bad way]]. In [http://forum.nin.com/bb/read.php?9,731489,page=22 this annoyingly monstrous thread] you can see this spoiled internet [[asshole]] still trying to remove the foot he had placed in his mouth...but he swears, this is the last time you will hear from him about the subject.

{{quote|<small><small>Just glanced at this stuff. May I clarify: I have no issue with PLUMP people and I apologize if some of you incorrectly inferred I was equating being overweight to being unworthy. I used that term for two reasons: one - these cunts on MS portray themselves as in a very inaccurate way, because they can. It's their one place they can wield a little power and escape their pathetic lives. Two - I knew it would hurt them and it most definitely has. Place my comments in context. If you haven't seen the type of comments we've been getting and the sheer level of ignorance, you have no reference in which to comment on this. I know MOST of you are not a part of this and I didn't mean to offend you - this situation has angered and saddened me. And THAT is it from me on this topic.</small></small>|Trent "Plump Cheeks" Reznor, right after he equated plump people to being unworthy.}}

Who in the music world uses such ideals as "worthiness" unless they are some sort of elitist douchebag? Is that what a snob like Reznor really thinks about his fans? The thread was then quickly locked and closed from further comment, even though a couple NIN asslickers managed to get a few posts in before Trent figured out  how to "turn his shit off." Unfortunately for Reznor, he can't turn off the rest of the internet, where his "foot in mouth" disease is being discussed at great length, further exacerbating his "hurt in butt" disease:

{{quote|<small><small>Exactly….ignore…and Reznor is the celeb and he should’ve known better. FIRST. He started it, so now he can deal with being ridiculed. Reznor acted like a jackass and he knows it…he’s just too stubborn and wetbrained to admit it…so he just goes into attack mode like a gorilla. He’s insane.</small></small>|From [http://fredwgarrettiii.wordpress.com/2009/06/11/fredgarrett-vs-trent_reznor-twitter-flame-war/ this blog post.] The post goes on for quite a while.}}

At some point during the discussion, [[Some argue|several individuals brought up the very point]] that Trent had abused the power he has over his site's members by passing out their [[Dox|information]]. Some went so far as to theorize that Reznor might egg the "NIN Army" into action to such an extent that they might even harm forum users he disagrees with [[IRL]]. But that could never happen...[[Internet Hate Machine|right?]]

{{quote|<small><small>This is why I am here and this is why I keep hammering this point. Celebrities such as Trent should not be allowed to abuse their power and endanger the health and well-being of their fans by harassing them, threatening them, or giving out their personal information. To do so is a flagrant abuse of power and could cause great harm, both psychological and physical, to the [[Butthurt|attacked fan]]. This behavior should be pointed out, shunned and railed against as being wrong.</small></small>|While it may be overcautious, who knows what a die hard NIN fans might be capable of if commanded by their lord and master?}}

It is also theorized that Reznor manipulates his fans, suggesting that some people who do not agree with him might be better off committing [[suicide]].  Of course, the [[Rage|raging]] internet is aghast at his implication, because most people are as big a [[faggot]] as Reznor is, even though most of them should really take his [[Advice dog|advice]].  Nevertheless, there were several "Frankly, I am shocked" replies.

[[Image:Right way.jpg|thumb|right|For epic win, follow instructions above]]

{{quote|<small><small>Trent is just acting like a pussy. Seriously, all he does is attack fans, then post lovey posts on NIN.com to his sheep. He is now attacking them, as being hurt, fat, plump, telling them how to commit suicide? I suppose since he is all those things, he knows those type of people? He needs help. Even Manson and Jeordie White agree that is he is off his rocker. He claims he can stay away from the internet, but yet, at least once a day, he’s posting something. [[Attention whore]]s.</small></small>|While it is nice that you are calling Reznor a pussy, but [[Nobody|who cares]] if  his fans slit their wrists?}}

[[Image:Tremoquit.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Internet trolls: 1 Trent Reznor: 0]]

As of mid-July, raging and frustrated after a long and fierce [[Buttsecks|battle]] with [[Troll|upstanding denizens of the internet]], Trent <s>[[DELETE_FUCKING_EVERYTHING|emoquit]] Twitter. And [[Shit_no_one_cares_about|nothing of value was lost]].</s> 

Well, look here, [http://twitter.com/trent_reznor he's back.]

==iPhone Application Gets the Go Ahead==

[[Image:Nin iphone.gif|thumb|If you cry long and hard enough, you can get your app on an iPhone.]]

[[Image:NinFAT.jpg|thumb|Trent should probably watch calling people [[Fat|plump]]. Also, aren't fat people supposed to be jolly?]]

After all of this drama and strife, Trent, [[Internet Tough Guy|internet asshole]] extraordinaire [http://www.engadget.com/2009/05/07/nin-app-store-update-approved-by-apple managed to get his iPhone application okayed] by [[Apple]].  While one might postulate that, in typical Reznor fashion, he [[Crybaby|whined and cried]] about it enough that Apple just gave the application the go ahead to shut his ever-simpering mouth, it might also be hypothesized that it is Trent's ability to browbeat and overwhelm people with his [[retard]]ed hostility that got the job done.  Perhaps it was this invective laced reply email he sent to Apple after he learned of the Downward Spiral application was initially denied:

{{quote|<small><small>...I'll voice the same issue I had with Wal-Mart years ago, which is a matter of consistency and hypocrisy. Wal-Mart went on a rampage years ago insisting all music they carry be censored of all profanity and "clean" versions be made for them to carry. Bands (including Nirvana) tripped over themselves editing out words, changing album art, etc to meet Wal-Mart's standards of decency - because Wal-Mart sells a lot of records. NIN refused, and you'll notice a pretty empty NIN section at any Wal-Mart. My reasoning was this: I can understand if you want the moral posturing of not having any "indecent" material for sale - but you could literally turn around 180 degrees from where the NIN record would be and purchase the film "Scarface" completely uncensored, or buy a copy of Grand Theft Auto where you can be rewarded for [[Vince Offer|beating up prostitutes]]. How does that make sense? You can buy The Downward Fucking Spiral on iTunes, but you can't allow an iPhone app that may have a song with a bad word somewhere in it. Geez, what if someone in the forum in our app says FUCK or CUNT? I suppose that also falls into indecent material. Hey Apple, I just got some SPAM about fucking hot Asian teens THROUGH YOUR MAIL PROGRAM. I just saw two guys having explicit anal sex right there in Safari! On my iPhone! Come on Apple, think your policies through and for fuck's sake get your app approval scenario together.</small></small>|From Trent's "How to Write a Business Letter" manual.}}

He later tries to explain his position on the iPhone and proves once and for all that he is a complete jackoff with this pathetic attempt at "computer savvy:"

{{quote|<small><small>Everyone - let me be clear. I love Apple products and as goofy and out-of-touch as their app approval process / policy is, I will still use them because they work [[Over 9000|1000X]] better than the competition. This is not a debate, it's a [[fact]]. The iPhone is THE most elegant, modern smartphone at this point in time and it's perfect for what we want to do with the NIN app - except for the ludicrous approval process, and that's what I want to draw attention to.</small></small>|He loves Apple...it are [[Fact|FACT]].}}

Now that the iPhone application has been okayed and is ready for download, one would wonder why a person would ever want to have this [[retard]]'s [[crap]] on their smartphone, but alas, there will always be a majority of [[idiot]]s in this world who enjoy [[shit]]ty music and the taste of some elitist snob's asshole.  Trent went on to [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|gloat]] over his [[Fail|minor victory]] as if he had just made a new platinum album...which he hasn't done in the [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|United States]] since 1999.

{{quote|The NIN iPhone app is unchanged, the "issues" seem to have been resolved." Looks like Apple [[Pussy|caved under intense criticism]].|If he worked as hard on albums as he does [[troll]]ing his fans and verbally abusing Apple, he might actually make some good music.  No, probably not.}}

{{quote|Steve Jobs should have told that self righteous d-bag to kiss his ass|More [http://www.engadget.com/2009/05/07/nin-app-store-update-approved-by-apple comments about the application].}}


== Reznor's Bedroom Habits ==

{{quote|Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor is "cool but neurotic," says a groupie who had him and rated the experience an "8" on a scale of 1 to 10. He likes [[Lemonparty|threesomes with two women]] and has been known to use candles as sex toys. We hear he's quite the [[dildo]] connoisseur. He also likes role-playing. We also hear Trent likes to be dominated once in a while and has "mommy issues." His [[penis]] is reportedly about 7.5 inches. Trent has a serious girlfriend now and he's reportedly faithful to her, so don't expect to hear any recent groupie stories on Trent.|Candles, eh? Does your child bride know about this Trent?
