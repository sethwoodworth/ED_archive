Corrupt.org

Ever wondered what happened to those kids back in school [[you]] thought could go on a killing spree, but never did? Well, they ended up crying on '''Corrupt.org'''; one of the [[bullshit|greatest]] [[satirical]] websites dedicated to ripping a new asshole into [[liberals]] and other [[fucktards]] in society. 

Unfortunately they have bad aim and often rip into scientists and people that actually know more about history than they do instead. Lead by many closet homos that consider themselves the pinnacle of human perfection, they write fantastic columns about [[shit nobody cares about|really cool stuff]]. When visiting, just remember they are “remaking modern society” from the comfort of their armchairs, you lazy faggots.

== Corrupt.org A Mission of [[tl;dr]] ==

When opening the website the first thing any unsuspecting [[Anon]] is hit with is a [[Goatse|Wall of Text]] that could protect China from the Mongols. Most of the updates on this behemoth of [[shit|information]] deal with their [[shit noone cares about|private lives]] and how it relates to good strong [[Slavery|conservative]] [[Pedophilia|values]]. However, the columnist of Corrupt.org will sometimes mix up the [[shitstorm]] by complaining about [[liberals]], the evils of [[niggers]], and how much it hurt after [[Obama]] [[raped]] them senseless. Anyone brave enough to try and read all the hundreds upon hundreds of horrible articles may just want to grab a couple [[Proxy|proxies]] and take a quick [[fap|fap]] break. 

== Corrupt.org A Mission of [[Pedo]] ==

It is also of important notice that like many other places of [[Fox News|Conservatism]] [[Pedophile|Pedophilia]] runs rampant like [[newfag|newfaggotry]] on [[/b/]]. Don't take my word for it, take theirs.

== The Source of Shit. The Corrupt.org bloggers. ==

Every ocean of piss has a river that feeds it. Corrupt.org has multiple bloggers that consider all else little more than trickles of urine from your [[tiny dick|cock]]. 
* '''Sofia Theotoky''' 
This whore spends most of her blogging time talking about good conservative [[Biting Beaver|womyn]], which is pretty goddamn hypocritical because this bitch hasn't spent one day in the [[kitchen]] making a man a sandwich. On her blog page she calls herself a [[Batshit insane|rare breed]] of [[USI|philosopher]]. This is [[bullshit]], because bitches like her come in droves. Not to mention the ongoing paradox caused by her [[women|not being in the kitchen]] 
* '''Frank Azzurro'''
As a young boy, Frank was [[trolled|made fun of]] for having a silly last name. 
{{quote|More like Frank ASSurro, [[amirite]]!|- [[Anon|David Davidson]], the mean liberal kid from across the street.}}
So Frank, deep in homicidal Christian [[rage]] threw himself into his father's whiskey cabinet. After his father got home and [[Rape|beat him]], he explained to the young Frank all the wonders of alcohol.
So little Frankie grew up, got married, and had two little rapelets of his own. Frank then decided he had become [[unwarranted self importance|important enough]] to express his ideals to the internet! Mr Assurro now spends his time when he is not in a drunken stupor posting [[Lies|well thought out]] articles for [[Noone|everyone to read]]!
