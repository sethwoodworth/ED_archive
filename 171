A Plus
[[Image:Helenkeller.jpg|thumb|Who is this person, children?  Helen Keller--that's right!  A+!  NOW SUCK MY DICK.]]
A [[catchphrase]] meaning "really good" or "top-notch", It's something you will never see, never. The [[Muslim]] analog of A+ is Aleph-Plus (from the arabic letter "Aleph"). Appropriately based on the primary and secondary school letter grade system (A, B, C, D, F), wherein a grade of "A" is considered "excellent", and "A+" denotes a grade marginally better than an "A". [[Intellectual|Teachers]] can give their students an A+ to make the victim trust them long enough to lure the [[trying too hard|over-acheiver]] [[Loli|kids]] [[Rape|into their office after hours]]. In many [[Europe|European countries]] grades are given on a scale from 4 to 10, so Europese [[ppl]] will more likely [[retarded|say "10+" rather than "A+."]]

In Netspeak, this is often considered not to provide enough degrees of variation, and thus you'll often see it used with more plus signs&mdash;the more plus signs, the better the content thus labelled. Originated in the [[eBay]] feedback system which is limited to 80 characters. [[Typical]] feedback: "A+++ EBAYER!!!1! WILL BUY AGAIN!!!!!!"

:''[[RealAdrian]]: Oh [[lol|LOL]].  A++++++''

== Numbers of Pluses++ ==
The numbers of pluses ("+" vs "++") have become a more and more intense problem for [[eBay]] users.  When leaving feedback a ebay user may find that he needs to rate someone higher than the last person he did business with.  Giving feedback in this manner is accomplished by adding another plus to the end of a lower score.

:''ebay user rates user isellstuff A++++++++++++''
:''ebay user wants to rate buymyshit higher than isellstuff''
:''ebay user appends another + to the score given to isellstuff''
This infinite circle to find a higher and higher ebay score led to the downfall of ebay.  [[At least 100]] ebay users revolted when they reached the 80-character feedback limit, thus could not find a score higher than A followed by 79 plusses. Luckily smart people avoid eBay, narrowly escaping a nightmare of supertexted numbers and algebraic equations.

==Other Uses==

A plus is also a [[fucktarded]] certification from Comptia that enslaves [[13-year-old boys]] as computer hardware repair guys for $8.99/hour. It requires studying [[TL;DR]] articles about [[shit nobody cares about|the XT motherboard, how to plug in PS/2 keyboards, etc]]. Typically done by script-kiddies and unix users who hoard computer carcasses in their [[basement dwellers|basements]] and try to prove to everyone that they are [[Unwarranted_self-importance|smart because they can assemble their own computer]].
