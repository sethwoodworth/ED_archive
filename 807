'''Badger Badger Badger''' (aka '''Badger''' and '''Badgerx3''', if you're an asshole) is an idiotic [[flash]] cartoon and [[old meme]]. It has killed the brain cells of [[at least 100]] million people.

The flash cartoon consists of a song with three images:

*Badgers doing aerobics.
*Close-up shots of mushrooms.
*A snake in the desert.

These three shots and the music loop '''forever''' (though if you can sit through the endless mind-sucking vampire rays, the music does get a bit disjointed from the video). Many scientific tests have been made and still [[noone]] knows why this flash is so popular. [[Some argue]] that watching this flash for prolonged periods converted the scientists to [[bestiality]], or the desire to copulate with [[furry|small animals]]. There appears to lay an arcane and [[inscrutable]] curse on the flash movie.

It is impossible to put into [[word]]s how truly stupid this flash is. And every spin-off cartoon sucks immensely too.

Just like other flash animation STDs of the [[internet]], this fails to deliver any [[lulz]].
