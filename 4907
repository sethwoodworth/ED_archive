Liver
The body organ second most abused by [[blog]]gers and [[journal]]ists. (See also [[cock]].) Liver is the preferred dish of Hannibal Lecter; he likes his with fava beans and nice chiante. Please take note that liver spots are not actually caused from the liver before or after eating.

Threatening to eat someone's liver during a [[flame war]] will almost always [[pwn]] your opponents and will sometimes result in visits from the [[FBI]]. Note that threatening to eat their spleen, eyeballs, or gall bladder can be equally effective.

NB: In [[England]], there is a place called Liverpool, because it has a large pool filled with floating livers. Members of [[The Beatles]] were spawned there, otherwise it is only famous for its outstanding fried onions. The Liver is also the Moroccan embodiment of love, as opposed to the heart. Don't worry, as they're expected to get another locust swarm in the near future.
