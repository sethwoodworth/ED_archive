'''[[Fucktard|L. Ron Hubbard (AKA, Lumpy Ron Humpard)]]''' a complete cock smoakin' faggot that was a criminally-minded, wife-beating, drug-using, paranoid-schizophrenic, alcoholic, abortionist and [[satanist]] with an [[Sea Org|unhealthy obsession with sailors]], who publicly admittedly that he created Scientology just as a means of making money. Which he did. Hubbard performed several [[abortions]] on his wife with a coat hanger. This is because he was trying to conceive the "moonchild" or a human infant possessed by the anti-Christ. He performed many satanic rituals on his wife. Hubbard didn't worship Satan, he thought he WAS Satan! 

However if you are a brainwashed [[Scientologist|Scientologist]] then you actually believe he was the [[Raptor Jesus|savior of mankind]], bringing [[enlightenment]] to the masses for a [[Over 9000|nominal fee]]. If you think that, then you believe that he was a [[Bullshit|War Hero]], a [[TL;DR|fantastic writer]], and the founder of a [[Lie|major religion]] with thousands of [[sheep|loyal adherents]]. You also think that the current wave of [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY|protests]] are the work of [[Marcab Confederacy|evil space aliens]] looking to [[Drama bomb|destroy the world]]. If you believe all that bullshit then you are a Niacin-eating, dictionary-crying, fake-smile giving  complete [[Fucktard|Douchebag]] that has severe emotional problems and are totally gullible giving all your money to a [[cult]].

Hubbard hated income taxes with a fury and all his sci-fi stories (e.g. [[Marcab Confederacy]]) treated it like the worst thing ever. But which would you rather have: income tax or [[pwn|all the yellow traffic lights reduced to lasting a fifth-second and machines giving everyone automated red-light-running tickets]]? Hubbard's confirmed violent mental illnesses spawned much of Scientology's criminality. Sometime in the 1940's, Ronnie was diagnosed by at least 2 professionals, as being paranoid, and schizophrenic.

==The Early Years==
'''Lafayette Ronald Hubbard''' (Known as Ronnie-winkle to Mrs. Hubbard who looked in her cupboard and saw her son fucking a child.),  was born [[at least 100 years ago]] in [[Boring|beautiful]] [[Kansas]] into an ultra - orthodox Hasidic Jewish family. His parents later moved with young LRH to [[Boring|even more beautiful]] [[Wyoming]]. LRH proved to have a very active imagination - fostered by the fact that there's nothing to do in all of Wyoming except [[Mr. Hands|horse-on-man lovin']]. According to LRH's various [[fanfic|original biographies]], by the time LRH began school, he had become a successful [[Heath Ledger|cowboy]], a [[Ninja|world class fighter]], a [[Mega ultra super genius|literary scholar]], a nun, and a [[Native American|member of the local Indian tribe]]. Beat that [[Jesus]], you fucking [[twink]].

Lolfail's family moved to [[Washington]] when L. Ron was 10. Soon after, a young L. Ron joined the ranks of proud Eagle Scouts like [[God hates fags|Fred Phelps]], [[an hero|Charles Whitman]], and [[Wal-Mart|Sam Walton]]. Or maybe he didn't. The Boy Scouts have no record of him doing this, but this is probably just a part of a huge [[Loose Change|conspiracy to hide the truth]].

==[[College]] and Becoming [[lie|A War Hero]]==

[[Image:Lronbaby.jpg|thumb|right| [[Y helo thar]]]]

[[Image:Lrh exposure1.jpg|thumb|Exposed on [[YouTube]].]]

L. Ron enrolled in an [[Vandalize Every Equation|engineering]] program at George Washington University. In a little over two years he managed to earn [[idiot|Ds]] and [[Fail|Fs]] in about half of his classes. However, this didn't stop L. Ron.

Oh, wait, yeah it did. LRH, looking to do something [[Gay|patriotic]] for his country, joined the Naval [[W|Reserves]] in 1941. According to L. Ron, when Pearl Harbor happened he was fighting off Japanese invaders in Java - where he was wounded and earned a [[Vox Dramatica prize|Purple Heart]], the [[Unwarranted self importance|first one earned in the whole of WWII]]. According to Navy records, L. Ron Was in [[New York City]] on December 7th, meaning that L Ron's biographers should really [[Check your facts|learn to use Google]]. Or maybe that Hubbard was fighting for the Japanese, making him in fact the ultimate [[wapanese|weeaboo]]!

===[[Japan|You're a sap, Mr. Jap!]]===
L. Ron's military achievements look a lot like a [[Quasidan's penis|certain EDiot's genitalia]]: long and distinguished. LRH's first command assignment lasted a grand total of [[Facepalm|one exercise]] before the Naval evaluator assigned to LRH declared "[[FGSFDS]]!!" and stripped it away from him. L. Ron's second naval assignment didn't last much longer. On the very first day he got command of the boat, L. Ron swore he found a Japanese submarine off the coast of Oregon. LRH, sensing an opportunity for [[300|eternal glory]] [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|launched every single piece of munitions he had]] into the [[Nothing|prowling enemy]]. Then, wanting to share the glory, LRH called for [[Habbo Hotel|/b/lackup in the form of four more boats and two blimps]]. The reinforcements confirmed that:
#There wasn't any wreckage anywhere.
#LRH had "found" the subs over a [[Trap|magnetic anomaly that might be confused for submarines]].
#LRH was a fucking [[noob]].
#LRH was missing half his brain.

LRH later talked about the incident to Scifags:

{{quote|I dropped the I-76 [sunk off the Solomon Islands three years after the incident] or the [[What|Imperial Japanese Navy Trans-Pacific Submarine]] [[Fellatio|down into the mouth]] of the Columbia River, dead duck. And it [[Cockmongler|went down with a resounding furor]]. And that was that. I never thought about it again particularly except to [[Butthurt|get mad at all the admirals I had to make reports to because of this thing]], [[Amirite|see]]? This was one out of seventy-nine separate actions that I had to do with. [[Truth|And it had no significance, see?]] But the other day I was kind of tired, and my dad suddenly sprung on me the fact that my [[Lie|submarine had been causing a tremendous amount of difficulty in the mouth of the Columbia River]]. Hadn't thought about this thing for years|[[LOL WUT]]}}

===Coronado Incident===
A month later, with one [[Mortal Kombat|flawless victory]] under his belt, LRH decided to take his [[Pirate|scurvy dogs]] out for some [[Vtech|target shooting]]. Unfortunately for LRH, he chose to anchor in [[Mexico|Mexican territorial waters]] and use land owned by [[Mexico]] and inhabited by [[Mexicans]] as his intended target. This caused an international situation akin to [[The Great Em/b/assy Security Leak of 2007]]. Had LRH simply [[Wikimapia|consulted a fucking map]] he might have avoided [[You fail it|shelling an allied nation]]. The Navy, now notably pissed, invoked the [[banhammer]] upon L. Ron and took away his [[ITTY BITTY BABY ITTY BITTY BOAT|boat]]. Habeeb it. LRH didn't quit, [[Peter Jennings died, so I'm going to quit smoking|despite a wealth of evidence that he should]]. On his next assignment, he uncovered a [[Paranoid|terrorist plot to destroy the boat]], finding a Molotov cocktail in the hold. The captain politely listened to Hubbard and told him to [[In the kitchen|get the fuck back into the kitchen where he belonged]].

[[Image:120511312384.gif|thumb|right| IS IT CAN BE PSYCHIATRIC CARE TIEM NOW PLEES?]]

LRH's other career highlights included:
*[[Argent009|Collecting government money for injuries]] even after he claimed to become a disease-free thetan-clear [[Scientologist]].
*Seeking psychiatric help for [[depression]].
**[[LOL]] [[Irony]].
*Claiming to have earned 21 separate medals, when he had earned only 6.
**Also claimed to have earned medals the navy [[Facepalm|doesn't even award]]. Whoops.
*Being arrested for check fraud.
**Writing the [[FBI]] for help fighting [[Communist]] spies who were framing him. This earned him a special [[Insane|"Fucking crazy"]] gold star in his FBI file.
*Graduating solidly in the [[Retard|bottom half]] of all his training classes.
*Single-handedly inventing, building and launching [[Penis|The Hubbard Telescope]].

==Fighting [[Witch]]es==
Somewhere in between [[Lie|defeating the Japanese]] and [[Lie|saving America]], LRH must have obtained his degree in the [[Harry Potter|Defense against the Dark Arts]]. The government - noting his [[Shit|amazing]] performance in WWII - hired him to infiltrate the [[cult]] known as the [[Goatse|Agape]] Lodge. L. Ron was to square off against some [[DivineAngel|uber-leet witches]] associated with crackpot jerkoff Aleister Crowley. In reality, Hubbard probably met Parsons because Parsons was active in the local Science Fiction scene. Hubbard would later plagiarize the shit out of the group when forming the mystical part of his own [[cult]]...er...[[religion]]. Hubbard sank the Lodge by convincing the lodge's master, the [[Drugs|completely burnt out]] Jack Parsons to give him his money and his boat. Parsons was like L. Ron minus the [[bullshit]]. He actually was a genius of sorts, helping to create the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena and developing several types of fuel later used in the space race. Parsons really liked acid, though, so the genius was dampened a little bit. LRH and Parsons [[Gay|hit it off rather well]] at first, working together on concepts of space and time later perfected by the minds behind the [[Timecube]]. Parsons and LRH went out into the desert to invoke the spirit of Babalon into manifestation, and LRH served as the seer, receiving the vision and communicating it to Parsons. This eventually lead to Parsons declaring himself to be the Antichrist and suffering a general nervous breakdown. LRH ended up taking most of Parson's money and Parson's one time [[girlfriend]]. Crowley laughed off the loss, he was already rich as hell anyway. However, Crowley had called L. Ron Hubbard out in correspondence with the lodge, labeling LRH a con artist. L. Ron, however, was set on course to found his own religion. Agape lodge had lots of drugs floating around it and interesting sexual arrangements, reportedly including an act of bestiality that was filmed by the members and possible incest between Parsons and his mother.

==Dianetics and [[Scientology]]==

[[Image:Lrontrippin.jpg|left|thumb|L. Ron Hubbard agrees, [[Rick James|cocaine IS one hell of a drug]].]]

[[Image:Stash3.jpg|thumb|Hubbard's personal stash on a bad day, usually it's twice that.]]

By the early 1950s, LRH had developed a new system of religion. Cribbed mostly from the work of Crowley, Parsons, and other science fiction writers, he developed a new theory on human behavior known as Dianetics. This astounding new theory was first published in the most respected journal of religion available at this time: ''Astounding Science Fiction''. 

Despite harsh criticism from both religious leaders and science fiction writers, L. Ron developed his theory into a religion. At the core was a bunch of [[TL;DR]] theories regarding flying saucers, little green men, tax collectors, and evil psychologists. Truthfully, [[Nobody|who the fuck cares]]? LRH was the real draw. Charming, enigmatic, and a habitual liar, LRH made his religion look like the most cutting-edge philosophy in [[Hippie|Beat Era America]]. LRH started earning [[Dongs|money]] hand over fist, earning hundreds of million dollars in the span of a few short years.

LRH didn't have one thing he really needed at this point: tax exemption. [[The man|The IRS]] came a knocking one day, looking for their cut of LRH's mounting wealth. LRH responded by taking the core of his church and moving them onto a cruise ship, thus founding the Sea Org. He patrolled the open seas, [[Drugs|expanding his horizons]] and [[Pedo|fucking the children of his brainwashed minions]]. Also, since LRH was now an [[Bullshit|enlightened being]], he didn't need to see doctors anymore. His health spiraled out of control. He smoked opium and abused [[Hypocrite|the same psychoactive drugs he prohibited his own adherents from using]]. His absolutely fucked up condition eventually drove him back to land. But the damage was done. Towards the end years of L. Ron Hubbard's life, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and psychotic delusions. When Hubbard was made aware of his mental state, he begged the Veterans Administration for help. When this request was denied, he developed a violent hatred for psychiatry. When Hubbard's insanity worsened, because of his insanity, he wrote the violent criminal and murderous scriptures and guidelines for Scientology bosses and executives, such as the fair game policy, and auditing process R2-45 (SP is to be shot with two rounds from a 45 caliber revolver). Which spawned most, if not all of the churches criminality and often violent criminal and fraudulent nature. According to Hubbard's secret scriptures, Scientology was created #1 to make money from it's victims, and #2 to "obliterate" psychiatry.

==[[Death]]==

[[Image:Lronreborn.jpg|left|thumb|He said he'd come back.]]

L. Ron lived on in a drug-addled haze for about another decade. Probably the best example of how people felt about him was in the way they treated his death. His second in command by this point, [[David Miscarriage]], delivered a tearful eulogy two days after his death:

{{quote|Thus, at 2000 hours, Friday 24 January 1986, L. Ron Hubbard discarded the body he had used in this lifetime for seventy-four years, ten months and eleven days. The body he had used to facilitate his existence in this universe had ceased to be useful and in fact had become an impediment to the work he now must do outside its confines. The being we knew as L. Ron Hubbard still exists. Although you may feel grief, understand that he did not, and does not now. He has simply moved on to his next step. LRH in fact used this lifetime and body we knew to accomplish what no man has ever accomplished - he unlocked the mysteries of life and gave us the tools so we could free ourselves and our fellow men.|[[David Miscarriage]], sucking some [[dead]] [[man]] [[cock]].}}

[[Image:Lrondeath.jpg|left|thumb|Now who am I going to make fun of?]]

The coroner, on the other hand, noted that Hubbard was "unkempt" in appearance with long, overgrown toenails and fingernails. They also found multiple needle marks on his [[ass]], covered by a band-aid, not to mention the dose of anti-anxiety drug in his system. The Co$, eager for the truth, promptly blocked any autopsy and [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|cremated the body]] before any further investigation could be performed. After briefly coming back as [[South Park|Stan Marsh]] it is now widely believed that L. Ron's soul is trapped in [[Xenu]]'s closet.
