Bigger Man Argument
[[Image:Internetarguments.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Faggotry|wit]] that spawned it all.]]
The '''"Bigger Man" Argument''' is well-known on the [[internets]] as the last refuge of people that get epically [[Troll|trolled]] and/or [[Pwnt|pwned]] in a public forum. Pulling it off involves cramming equal parts [[faggotry]] and [[fail]] into the words "I'll be the bigger man", or some paraphrased version thereof.

==Origins and Usage==

The "Bigger Man" Argument stemmed from a meme that is [[at least 100|at least 100 years old]] and therefore has been abused to the point where it is just as annoying as the fag using it, even though [[lulz]] were provided because it shows what the future holds for [[Sarah Palin|Sarah Palin's]] son Trig. For history and documentation's sake, the meme is as seen to the right, featuring the [[retard|heroic Olympian]] struggling to overcome hurdles.

Someone thought they were being [[CP|real fucking cute]] with the macro, but ended up starting an epidemic of "Bigger Man"-style comments and rehashings of the meme. The numbers of macro-abortions that resulted from this outnumber the total [[Fag|victims]] of [[AIDS]].

Most often, the "Bigger Man" Argument is used by some [[retard]] as a last-ditch effort to prove to the [[Anonymous|rulers of the internets]] that he is superior to someone who [[troll|trolled]] him and/or exposed him to be a [[bitch|little bitch]]. They realize that they cannot win an argument through sheer [[moralfags|moral superiority]], and they're too [[retard|retarded]] to unleash an [[Lazer|epic anti-troll blast]]. So thinking they're [[fail|taking the moral highroad]] by becoming the "Bigger Man," and claiming they're above such [[Baby fuck|"banal" and "asinine" behavior]], they declare:

{{quote|I'm going to be the bigger man.}}

After this profound display of faggotry, the proclaimer proceeds to either [[STFU|shut the fuck up]] or leave in a dramatic huff once they realize the troll wasn't [[rape|fazed]] by what they said. Often times before they leave, they're further badgered by the troll, resulting for more lulz for all involved minus the "[[Fag|Bigger Man]]" who failed to impress the internets.

==Success Rate==

There has been no proven or documented cases of the "Bigger Man" Argument ever working. Even looking through the [[Goatse|annals]] of [[Last Thursday|history]], no reports of [[Win|success]] surfaced. It is quite possible that this argument will [[Nigras|never work]], because no self-respecting [[troll]] would find themselves overwhelmed by the moral proclamation of some [[pussy]] and back down and admit defeat. Or in short words for you retards: LOL no success rate whatsoever
