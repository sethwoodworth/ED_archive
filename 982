Birkhead
'''Birkhead''' is a minor [[4chan]] meme, which consists of a [[deviantart|superbly drawn]] portrait of (by coincidence) Larry Birkhead. The image is believed to have originated from [http://nitronight.deviantart.com here], although it was posted on 4chan's Artwork/Critique board by an [[anonymous]] user. The masterpiece was subsequently praised by the members of [[Art School|/ic/]] and is now commonly used as an indication of respect and approval in future threads containing artwork that displays a similar level of [[Failure|expertise]] in human portraiture.
