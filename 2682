#In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
#And the earth was [[boring|without form, and void]]; and [[TV|darkness was upon the face of the deep]]. And [[Tim Berners-Lee|the Spirit of God]] moved upon the face of the waters.
#And [[Al Gore|God]] said, Let there be [[Internets|light]]: and there was [[Internets|light]].
#And God saw the light, that it was [[EPIC|good]]: and God divided the [[Internet|light]] from the [[Internets|darkness]].
#And God called the light [[ED|Day]], and the darkness he called [[4chan|Night]]. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
#And God said, Let us make [[lurkers|man]] in [[fail|our image, after our likeness]]: and let them have [[bestiality|dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth]].
#So [[b|God]] created man in his [[FAIL|own image]], in the image of God created he [[Epic Fail Guy]].
#And thusly, [[Epic Fail Guy]] was the original man, a man who was so full of [[fail]] that he was cast from paradise for he did not understand that one should [[lurk moar]].
#Thereafter, having seen his [[fail|own image]], God gave up creating man and left to God's [[btards|/b/astard children]] the naming rights to all '''Epic Guys''' henceforth.
