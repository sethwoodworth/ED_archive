== <s>The Browser</s> ==
<s>Lynx is a [[Fail|text-only]] console browser supposedly used only by [[Lunix]] geeks and other idiots with [[no life]], or the blind. Nobody actually uses it, except possibly programs created by [[Google]], which makes it more popular than [[Opera Browser|Opera]], but less popular than [[sex]].</s>

Should prolly be its own article, but I'm a lazy newb, who does know/bother.
