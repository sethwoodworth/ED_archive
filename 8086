[[Canada|Canadians]], generally strangers to modern technology, can now use cell phones to discuss their feelings of hockey and how goddamned cold it is, thanks to TELUS. 

Because no one really gives a shit about [[Canada]], they are one of the few remaining cell phone companies to use CDMA technology, whatever the fuck that is, which apparantly uses magic and wishful thinking, as opposed to the GSM service that 99.999 percent of the world uses (even Africa)

# You are more than 5 meters away from a signal tower

* Since [[Canada]] is not yet advanced enough to have Jews, Telus instead controls the media, government and phone service.
* Unlike black person, Telus is constantly in trouble with the law and widely known for not working.
