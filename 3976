Image Macro
[[Image:Tex on imaeg.jpg|thumb|This is the [[fag]] who makes these godawful things.]]

A phrase originating in the [[Something Awful]] forums to describe images often used on [[USENET]] before the popularization of forums on the internet. An image macro is a photo or picture with a (<s>usually</s> rarely) witty phrase superimposed over it, most commonly in white 48pt Impact with a black five pixel stroke. Often used in [[flame wars]] and a fundamental feature of [[gif war]]s, they convey a humorous message of disdain towards the original poster or the entire thread.

If overused, their impact can be diminished, leading to a lack of [[lulz]]. Most image macros suffer overuse within hours of their debut, quickly turning into [[old meme]]s. [[99%]] of the [[internets]] is oblivious to this and will continue using them well past their expiration dates, or until [[2012]], when the [[O RLY]] owl will swoop down and [[pwn]] them [[in the ass]].

All you need for a good macro is a hilarious picture with a hilarious [[caption]]. Both are needed for the perfect macro. However, if the caption is unfunny, the image automatically becomes fail.  If you are a lazy motherfucker, you can have a website do the work for you: ''See [http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/motivator.php] and [http://wigflip.com/roflbot/]''

== What do they mean? ==

Sometimes, not always, the meaning of certain image macros is not always clear. They can leave [[FUD|fear, uncertainty and doubt]] in the minds of the receiving individual. Here is a brief guide to what some image macros mean.

|I'm sorry sir/ madam, but you obviously do not comprehend what is going on directly in front of you so it may help to just sit back and watch for a while longer until you do.
