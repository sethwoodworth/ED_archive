Sociology
[[Image:Marxpimp.png|thumb|left|Proof.]]
'''Sociology''' is the science of ''being better than juu''. It is not to be confused with [[psychology]] (the science of ''I am right and juu are wrong''), although both disciplines share a common interest in [[trolling]] be it [[OL]], [[IRL]] or on a societal scale. The practise of sociology is called ''symbolic violence'' and consists in annoying the shit out of the object of the [[retarded|sociological discourse]] with [[liberal|cool]] sounding claims that have no substance.

One of the great things about social research is you don't really have to do that much. Just breathing and maybe glancing around once in a while is called ''frateur''. In sociological circles this actually constitutes genuine [[sauce|source material.]] One of the less great things about having no sensible system of research is that your diploma will be worth about as much in the real world as, say, shares in [[Google]].

Luckily studying is not the only thing you can do when studying sociology, infact most(85-87%) of students majoring in Social Sciences find studying the easiest aspect of their lives. Wasting mommy's dollars in politics, wasting hours and hours on meaningless [[blog]]s no-one will ever read, drugging yourself senseless or just fucking every and each ([[gay|since gender is just a construct]]) 14-year-old that comes your way take up most of the time and attention in an average sociology student. Who really gives a shit? Art students seem to be doing okay.

==Sociological Research==

Should two or more sociologists ever come in to contact with each other, they will reach critical mass and implode into a superdense sphere of mumbled jargon and claims about perspective. This is because sociologists, as a rule of thumb, don't know shit about anything. Let us say a murder has taken place, it was done with a fork, the butler was playing [[World of Warcraft]] and it is necessarily some one in the room. A sociological investigation would go something like this.

#Have all the people in the city fill out a questionnaire about the mansion and it's residents. The more people fill the form out, the righter the results will be.
#Analyze the data for two years before finally noticing people have been entering answers like "Jurgen Offen, Space Detective."
#Since that was sort of pointless, do a discursive analysis (speech patterns and [[shit]]) of the suspects.
#Conclude that:
## There is underlying misogyny in the speech patterns of the janitor
## The Gender of the Master's son does not fit an established masculine role. There are therefore three possibilities: he is [[Gay]], he is a [[furry]], or he is a [[trap|reverse trap]]. Pray fervently to what gods there be that it's the third one.
## There is a class gap between the service and the Masters family
#Request funding to set up a commission to investigate the premise '''there is an error in society and the world'''.
#Conclude that the murdered couldn't help it because of peer pressure, sexual inequality, [[jews|social injustice]] and [[Wikipedia|misinformation]].

==Connections With Pedophilia==
Don't be deceived by the sweet talk however; unlike [[philosophy]] (which is a fucking [[scientology|cult]]), sociologists have no soul and consider being a manipulative bastard a coveted asset. A sociologist believes in a better world, but ''only as long as it will bring him free [[hookers and blow]]'' (and your little sister).
