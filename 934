'''''Beyblade''''', known in Japan as '''''[[Fail|Babe Laid]]''''', or perhaps most accurately [[gay|Gay Blade]] (that's so clever because you replace "bey" with "gay" and those two words sound alike so it's a very effective way of calling beyblade gay!) is a censored Japanese hentai anime about [[Muslim]] rape and kids playing with [[extreme advertising|EXTREME]] Jew. In Japan it is one of the most successful hentai series ever, in the United States it is meant for a far younger public. To make it up, 4kids has added a [[furry]] to the series. We're not quite thankful, but the thought is supposed to count. The series was developed and created by [[gay|Takao Aoki]] and was originally a comic before Satan had the awful idea of turning it into a television series. The first season had a whole 51 episodes, which means that people in Japan will literally watch anything as long as it involved [[tentacle rape|large-eyed characters]] and some sort of machinery they use to beat each other to death with.

==Story==

None. No seriously, there is no developing story. But since we're all friends in a very homophilic way.

There's one guy named Tyson. He's an emo with a top given to him by a [[Muslim]]. Since his top can't cut, he trains with his best friend Max, who also happens to be a [[Muslim]]. All of the sudden a nerdy boy from the [[Lulz]] club comes around and asks to join them. A [[furry]] and a ninja will join soon after the nerd. [[Copypasta|They just keep training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and the game training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training, and training...]]

The story pretty much revolves around a group of Nazis known as [[Faggots|Bladebreakers]]. They want to win the World Beyblading Championship, because the entire world apparently has nothing better to do than play with [[gay]] little toys. [[OM NOM NOM|Tyson]] is the main character and he enters this championship to show how good he is at [[buttsecks|beyblading]]. He eventually [[masturbation|beats]] some chink named Kai and they later have hot [[buttsecks]] and decide to take their [[faggotry]] on the road. They travel to China where they are run over by tanks. The rest of the plot consists of them [[buttsecks|buttfucking]] opponents from around the world to be BAYBLADE MASTAS! Then they get to Russia, and as it what is usually the case with Russia, they meet the most [[gay|evil]] beybladers in the world. They then realise that an evil corperation called [[powerthirst|BIOVOLT]] was really controlling them with special Soviet war technologies. They beat the evil corperation and become [[fag|BAYBLADE MASTAS!]]

===V-Force===

THis is what happens when enough dumbfucks watch a [[shit|shitty]] show. Like [[overrated|Lost]], it gets another season because network executives aren't quite satisfied with wiping their ass with 20 dollar bills. Basically all the little [[shit|shitheads]] from the last one get gangraped by [[moar|more]] evil [[fag|beybladers]]. [[lolwut|They then find out a giant robot was behind it all but the robot was apparently once human but thinks being a robot makes him happier. He then gets beat by Tyson who goes into a long monologue that tells everyone something about being happy and how you don't need to be a robot to be successful in life.]] The moral of the story is really to not black person



==Successful==

Sounds boring huh? But why is this series so popular in Japan? It's because we can't enjoy the full delight of this awesome series, since [[4kids]] has taken the courage of turning this awesome [[hentai]] series in a series for children and Michael Jackson. '''''Babe Laid''''' (''ですですですですです in [[Moonspeak|Japanese]]'') actually has a story, though [[noone]] knows what it's about, since [[noone]] can read Japanese in this modern age. [[Otaku]]'s were trying, but they'd rather watch ''[[Naruto]]'' and ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura]]''. The awesome [[lulz]] will never be seen on the western shore, not even through the almighty [[internets]]. The original catch phrase for show was [[An hero|"Go Shoot"]], but was replaced with [[buttsex|"Let it Rip"]], to avoid references to [[school shooting]]s.

==Rating==

*''Action'': The action brings you back to the old days where tits were not yet invented and tops were as cool as Judas Priest is now. Also, plenty of montages to go with the training and training and training... Not to mention dumb shouting at pieces of spinning plastic shit to move them around.
*''Lulz'': None, [[4kids]] has erased all the lulz and replaced them with an additional character.
*''Gayness'': A group of 5 men, and that means ONLY MEN, who play with spinning tops and get critically hurt when playing with them. Sounds like [[Muslim]]. 
*''Morals'': The Power of [[Communism|Friendship]]! It can destroy more than the Nazi regime! Worth an expired coupon at [[Larry]] the Lulzy Laundrycleaner! Have a [[Communist|friend]] you faggot! Yeah right, they stole that shit concept from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh]]'', [[Irony|even though Beyblade was created before Yu Gi Oh.]]
