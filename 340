'''Alexa''' is a popular [[spyware]] that comes preinstalled with all [[Windows]] installations. It tracks [[i see what you did there|what you are doing]] and reports it back to Alexa. Alexa is also used to decide where a page ends up when using [[Google]] which can attract many more users to the website. This caused the cycle of failure which attracts people to [[Wikipedia]] leading them to believe that it is a real encyclopedia, and also here which is one way to derive [[Hamtaro's Theory]].

They also try to sell you used books at double price and subscriptions for virtual magazines.
