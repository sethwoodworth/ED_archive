Sell Out
[[Image:DaveMustaineCoffeered.jpg|thumb|It's more likely than you think!]]

In the world of artistic performance, some performers actually make [[EPoints|money]] off of their performances, or change their craft to better suit a wider audience. When this occurs, the words "[[sell out]]!" will surely arise from the souls of many [[pwned]] [[indie]] [[fucktard]]s. They are upset because their favorite band may become known by more than four people, therefore becoming uncool. 

While this typically applies to [[music]]al groups, it can apply to any type of performer or profession.

{{Warning|text=If you (correctly) tell a [[Juggalo]] that the [[Insane Clown Posse]] sold out, he will try to [[fuck]] you [[in the ass]].}}

==Examples==

*'''The Who''' - [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002OX5/qid=1112296164/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/102-3885226-2652923 The Who Sell Out, the album.]

*'''[[Ska|Reel Big Fish]]''' - [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00137T65O/ref=dm_mu_dp_trk1?ie=UTF8&qid=1224125769&sr=1-1 See this song's title.]

*'''[[Metallica]]''' - Produced an album that was full of songs that ran 4-5 minutes long with [[gay|no solos and tuned-down guitars]], not the usual 8-12 minute long epic that they used to record.

*'''[[Megadeth]]''' - Band leader Dave Mustaine once claimed that Megadeth was always a "rock" band. Plus he sells his own brand of coffee.

*'''Kreator''' - Played Death/Thrash Metal in the 80s and started to play [[Goth|industrial metal]] in the 90s.

*'''[[EA]]''' - Used to make shitty games in the 80s and early 90s. Hit it big with the Madden and is now an unstoppable force in the gaming industry. [[EA]] can, and will, buy any game developer and [[rape]] its IPs.

*'''System of a Down''' - On their Hypnotize album, Daron Malakian sings about how [[emo|lonely]] he becomes after becoming a money-obsessed asshole and having no real friends.

*'''Green Day''' -  After taking the punk rock sound and making it radio friendly in the mid-90s, they pissed off all of their old fans who liked their childish "booger and poop" themed old songs. Which in turn inspired the band to write their famously misinterpreted "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" song, which was supposed to be a fuck you to the fans who thought they were sell-outs but was misinterpreted as being a break-up song. After their next couple of albums tanked, they actually did sell out via writing poorly written (because satire is about calling everyone an "idiot", [[amirite]]?) politically motivated songs about how they hate [[America]] and think it is turning into [[1984| a dictatorship]]. Yet, they still live in their nice, comfortable, American homes in Beverly Hills.

*'''Cryptopsy''' - Played technical death metal in their early days. Now, they play shitty deathcore that sounds like nu-metal put together.

*'''Christian Death''' - Ever since Rozz Williams became [[an hero]], some faggot named Valor Kand along with Maitri(whose vocals sound like a crackwhore being choked to death by her abusive husband) decided to sellout into being generic shitty alt-rock. The only decent thing about this band nowadays is Maitri because she's bangable.  

*'''[[Linkin Park]]''' - Sold out the moment they signed a record deal, and became the "punch an emokid" emo Limp Bizkit everyone wished would get AIDS and die. 

*'''[[J-Rock|Dir en grey]]''' - Pissed off their fanbase of [[16-year-old_girl|16-year-old girls]] when they quit being kawaii visual ghey trannies, made [[moar]] songs with indecipherable [[engrish]] blarg metal lyrics to appeal to gaijin, and sold albums in Hot Topic for $16 instead of the usual $40 that kept <strike>sane americans</strike> Jew from buying their shit.  

*'''[[Faggot|In Flames]]''' - Haven't sold out yet--still suck.

*'''The Rasmus''' - For claiming to be goth rockers, but actually being stupid [[My Immortal|preps]] who swim in pools of money. 

*'''[[Slipknot]]''' - Sold out when people realized that they stole their entire gimmick from Mushroomhead. Which makes them twice as bad of sell-outs, considering Mushroomhead stole their gimmick from KISS in the first place.

*'''Lamb of God''' - [[Bullshit|By turning their wicked metal riffs into mainstream bullshit (*cough* the sacrament album *cough*) with annoying nu-metal screaming that every 13-year-old-boy loves.]]

*'''[[You]]''' - You would do anything for a little cash, wouldn't you? You fucking bastard.

*'''[[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]''' - Fucking [[eBay]] ads. Does it sound familiar, ED? 

*'''[[YouTube]]''' - They support [[anti-lulz]] material on their website (aka featured videos) for money and painful but lovely [[buttsecks]], although some YouTube trolls such as Daniuzumaki and [[Lonelygirl15]] prefer [[Roman Shower]]s.

*'''[[Tay Zonday]]''' - Made a super-[[meme]] thanks to [[Anonymous]] and [[4chan]], but then everyone else started talking about him, and he soon became a corporate whore by allowing himself to be featured in commercials. Anonymous will <s>not</s> be taking this lying down, of course.

*'''[[Blizzard]]''' - Ever since they made ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. Now every faggot can claim to be [[leet]] in a shitty MMORPG!

*'''[[Sony Online Entertainment]]''' - ''[[EverQuest II]]'' and [[pizza]]. Ordering pizza from a fucking MMO?!

*'''Dan Slott''' - For agreeing to write ''[[Spider-Man]]'' after they had Joe Quesada make a deal with Satan to get rid of Mary-Jane Watson, just so JQ could live out his mid-life crisis by making Peter a stupid manwhore who fucks strange women and get herpes...

*'''3 Doors Down''' - Sold out since day one when they hopped on the [[Grunge#Post-Grunge|post-grunge]] bandwagon, but they managed to sell out rock and roll completely with the song and music video "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgV6VUinDEA Citizen Soldier]". How? Well, think about it: what does rock and roll represent? Rebellion! What does the army represent? [[The Man]]! Way to ruin rock and roll forever, faggots.

*'''[[Perez Hilton]]''' - For making four new websites [http://fitperez.com/][http://teddyhilton.com/][http://unratedperez.com/][http://cocoperez.com/] all with plenty of advertising, and presenting ads as blog posts.  Also, for ceasing to make make fun of celebrities because he [[troll's remorse|reallized that bullying was wrong]].  A shame, because that's the only reason we go to his site.
