Lag
__NOEDITSECTION__
'''Lag''', a primary source of [[nerd rage]], can be caused by a number of things:

*[[Dialup]]
*[[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]
*[[Slashdot]]

Above all of these however are [[Korea|Koreans]], who seem to generate lag when within five feet of a freeway or [[Starcraft]].

THERE'S A REASON WHY LAG RHYMES WITH [[FAG]].


== Effects ==
Lag is the leading cause of [[hax]] on [[counterstrike]], causing [[butthurt]] and [[drama]] among [[13 year old boys]]. Experts in [[CSIII]] will tell you to buy more [[dildos|RAM]] to solve your problem when in fact its probably your shitty connection.

== What do I do if I have lag? ==
#Blame host
#/reconnect
#Turn off [[kazaa]]
#[[RAGE]]
#???
#Profit!

If all else fails commence [[rage]] once AGAIN.

== FUCKING '''ASSHOLE''', I WAS ALMOST DONE WITH THAT LEVEL!!! ==

Your almost done with '''Gayfags: The videogame''' and then:

'''FUCKING LAG.'''

What you can do:

* [[Shit]] [[dicks]].
* '''[[RAGE]]'''!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
