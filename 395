'''Alvin Greene''' is an [[Iraq|American War Hero]]/[[basement dweller]] and possible [[porn star]] who [[fraud|won]] the 2010 [[Democrat]] nomination for [[Politics|Senate]] in South Carolina even though he never left his father's fucking house and spent no money on campaigning. Alvin lacks even the most basic essentials for a man running for office, including a [[website]] and cell phone.  I mean seriously, what kind of dumb shit [[Politics|politician]] doesn't have a [[Then who was X|phone]] to [[Gov.palin@yahoo.com|hack]]?

==Background== 
On qualification day, a lone [[Negro]] named Alvin Greene walked into the South Carolina legislator with $10,400 in cash, and wanted to be placed on the ballot. Because he was black, the [[KKK|good folks of the South Carolina legislature]] rightfully figured it was crack money and refused to take it, telling him to come back with a check. A few hours later Alvin Greene returned, this time with a check, and was placed on the ballot. At first, [[noone]] paid attention to him because he never appeared at any functions and raised no money while his opponent was [[fucktard|working hard]] to gain the nomination and run against the incumbent [[Republican]] Jim Demint. But, on election day everyone was in for a shock as Alvin beat his opponent by 20 points.

Even by the already low standards of jigaboos and [[South Carolina|South Carolinians]], Alvin Greene is a fucking moron. He was not even able to answer the most basic questions, such as explaining what TARP was or even who he is running against in November. Alvin Greene pretty much makes [[Sarah Palin]] look like Socrates. However while most Republicans love Palin because of her [[tits]], Democrats wish Greene would fuck off or just die a mysterious death before the election a la JFK.(If only they could find a grassy knoll in SC). That is not all of Greene's problems as he is also currently being charged with showing [[p0rn]] to a [[slut|white female college student]] and was [[banned]] from the Army for unknown reasons. He also asked the girl in question to "go to her room" (as in asking for sex) and surely it was in his rights to ask and receive sexual services as he an American [[Hero]]. Recently he announced plans to make a [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2010/jul/07/alvin-greene-dolls-south-carolina Toyline]  of his, to get America back to [[work|work]].

==Democrats see black person Helicopters==
[[File:Greene_check_edited-2.jpg|thumb|Alvin's lottery ticket]]
Not to be outdone by by Republican [[birthers]], the Democrats has embarked on [[Alex Jones]] shit of their own, claiming that Alvin Greene is a Republican [[sock|plant]] [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/06/vic-rawl-calls-for-investigati.html?wprss=44 and questioning the results of the vote] to assure GOP victory in November, complely ignoring that it makes no sense that the Republicans would do that as doing so would require the Republicans somehow get the word out on Alvin Greene to get enough people to vote for him while at the same time having him never run a single ad. In reality its just a bunch of [[butthurt]] [[leftards]] trying to justify how a man this fucking stupid could be the nominee.
