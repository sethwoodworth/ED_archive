'''GayPal''' (formerly known as PayPal) is one of the world's biggest internet [[scam]]s which unlike most other scams, is welcomed into the [[tube]]s with open arms. Owned by [[eBay]], it has been crafted very carefully into the world's largest unregulated bank, meaning eBay can and will steal all your money whenever they so feel. eBay promotes them by not just the lie that PayPal is safe, but the also lie that no other payment form is safe and has caused everyone to stop paying their rent, taxes, bridge tolls, restaurants, grocery stores, and hookers because they won't take PayPal.


==People Who Use GayPal==
It's a proven fact that every single person that uses PayPal only does it because they are forced to. When people on eBay learned from a terrible thing called a [[google|Google search]] that PayPal was a scam, everyone fled it in droves. When eBay learned how this terrible thing of a ''google search'' can reveal how PayPal is a scam, eBay banned Google Checkout from its site in retaliation. But when people still kept quitting PayPal, eBay made PayPal required on its entire site [http://www2.ebay.com/aw/uk/200803211515302.html] and then made half of its website paypal-only [http://web.ebay.co.uk/businesshub/index.php?page=safe_payments] with no exceptions.

==PayPal Promotes Identity Theft==
Once you get more than $250 that has come into your paypal account, regardless of whether you hit your monthly limit, PayPal will freeze your account until you give them your social security number, credit card number, utility bill, photocopied ID, proof of address, birth certificate, 1/3 of your income for 6 months, photo of your cock, your first newborn son [http://www.michaeljan.com/2007/08/fuck-paypal.html and more stuff.] Once they have that, they will sell it to illegal [[Mexican]] immigrants so they do identity theft on you, largely [[for the lulz]].

PayPal will also demand your supplier info before they let you sell again. This is because the PayPal employees also sell on eBay. They want your supplier info so they can buy at wholesale prices.

== How to [[Troll]] PayPal ==
The way to get back at PayPal is to list about 100 items on eBay, sell them for prices way lower than the competition. Buyer pays immediately by PayPal, and then a day later you refund everyone's payment and send them a boilerplate email, saying "PayPal has advised me to refund your payment, citing security concerns over the funding of your PayPal account. Please contact them at 1-888-221-1161 to resolve the situation." Usually more than half will call PayPal, because they are getting such a great price on the item. This ties up PayPal's customer service for a few hours, and a portion of the buyers will tell you they are going to stop using PayPal all together because of the all their BS. Great thing is it is perfectly legal.

==How to Get Free Items on [[eBay]] With PayPal: Buyer's Guide==
Legal: This is technically illegal, but the law counts it as a civil matter as long as it's under $10,000 per transaction.  In addition, most buyers who pay with paypal use this so it's pretty common.  eBay and PayPal endorse this, but if you plan to do it every single time then your paypal account will get banned so open a PO Box, get a credit card going to that, then clear cookies and change your IP before making a new gaypal account.

*Don't worry if the seller says they don't accept PayPal. If eBay isn't forcing every seller to take it they will in a couple months. [[:Image:Ebay now will only let people use paypal for credit card payments.jpg|Not even merchant accounts will be allowed.]] If the seller doesn't take it, eBay will just remove any unpaid [[strike]] purely because you wanted PayPal.  For fun, don't search PayPal only, and find the ones that say they don't take PayPal -- unless the seller is smart and links to this article as the reason why (and all eBay sellers should).
*Win something by eBay but wait as long as possible to pay.  You have 45 days to get your [[Internet money|money]] back from PayPal from the time you send it, but the seller only has 45 days to give you an unpaid item [[strike]] from when the auction ends.
*Pay by [[credit card]].  Never every give PayPal your [[dox|bank account]] because PayPal falsely claims it is safer than credit card. They want you to use your bank account because they can then charge credit card level fees and only pay bank account level fees. Credit card counts as a purchase with charge-back rights, while bank account is ACH so you're fucked. Rule of thumb: whenever PayPal claims something is safe, it is not. 
*Ask the seller to leave you [[A Plus|feedback]] after you paid.  You can even leave them positive feedback first so they know you won't neg them.  This insures that your reputation is clean.  If they put [[Hate mail|a follow-up comment]], make your feedback private--you still have that positive.
*If your address is not confirmed, meaning your credit card billing address is different from the one the seller shipped to, then you already have a free item.
*If they didn't track it, or you live outside of the [[USA]], [[Canada]], and [[UK]] you've already got a free item.  Just file a complaint for "item not received" and even if the seller delivered to your home and has your signature, you've got a free item thanks to GayPal.  Be sure it's 45 days after the end of the auction, so the buyer can't give you that unpaid item [[strike]]--that means pay several days after the auction ends as PayPal gives you 45 days to complain so you have a narrow window of a few days; you could wait longer but some sellers are insane about being paid fast.
*If they did, choose "item not as described."  You then have some options:
:a) One easy way is to buy something expensive, file a "not as described" and then tell PayPal the item is fake (e.g. fake rolex, bootleg DVD) and then PayPal will tell the buyer to destroy the item instead of returning it. The buyer gets their money back and don't have to return the item.
:b) Return an empty box. Law enforcement won't care as long as it's under $10,000.
:c) Go and find a broken version of the item and return that.  Don't just return an empty box--that's amateur.  Try to switch all of the barcodes and labels if there are any.  This is what most do.
:d) Ship the package to the seller's zip code, but not to the seller: either a friend or a mail boxes etc.  Tracking only shows zip code for privacy reasons and paypal doesn't care if it's signed--maybe the seller will think their [[nigra]], [[Mexican]], or [[white trash]] neighbor stole it.
:e) If you live in the UK, there's a law that all business must post their physical address and must accept returns for any or no reason for up to 14 days.  The law even lets you order food, eat the food, and then return the jar that once held the food.
:8.If the seller somehow wins that, file a credit card chargeback.  <u>Paypal never disputes chargebacks.</u>

*Other options available can be accessed by ordering a partner credit card on a fake name and using this to purchase gift cards.

==How to Rip Someone Off on Paypal as a Seller==
[[Image:Gaypal_b.png|thumb|right|Don't be surprised when you see this deformed message]]
* If PayPal requires delivery confirmation, ship an envelope with a store coupon (empty envelope looks weird) with tracking to any non-closed mailbox in their zipcode that's not them.
* If PayPal requires signature confirmation, do the same thing but also use an internet phone book search and make sure it's someone with their same last name and require signature.

*The buyer will think someone stole it off their porch or a family member stole it.

*If the buyer files a paypal dispute for non-delivery they will lose.  If the buyer didn't pay with their credit card, then they'll never be able to get their money back.  Make sure to ship the item fast, to a confirmed address, and to the USA to qualify for paypal's "seller protection" against chargebacks.

*[[Protip]]: If you live in the USA, when money starts coming into your PayPal account, PayPal will freeze your funds and ransom it for your [[social security number]] among other things.  Don't give them it.  Go to [[Home Depot]] and ask the illegals where you can buy someone's name and social security number -- it should cost $25.  In the UK, paypal does a phone verification so you can get a prepaid cell phone or just change your landline phone number whatever, though their phone verification can't match any non-published number so you then just have to call them and explain this.

*Another way is that if you receive money outside of eBay, PayPal only lets you dispute non-delivery and not if they shipped an empty box.  Also, even on eBay, if your charge is "service", then PayPal won't let you dispute it at all with them.  Sure in both cases, the buyer can dispute it with their credit card but credit card company so eventually you get a chargeback, but credit card companies always wait about two months to tell merchants of the chargeback, so you can be long gone with the money by the time PayPal learns of the chargeback.  Credit card companies wait two months to tell merchants of chargebacks because 99% of them are friendly fraud (where the buyer goes on a shopping spree and then falsely claims their card was stolen to get the items for free), but credit card companies get most of their profits from friendly fraud and if they told merchants immediately, the merchant could just hold the goods 7 days after a credit card payment like a personal check and credit cards would lose their trillions of dollars profit a year in chargeback fees.

==How to Rip Off PayPal Themselves==

* Start out by getting a Walmart/Greendot money card with about $50 on it, then open a new PayPal account.
* Once you receive the card, add the card itself to the account. Easy, right? Next you add the direct deposit account numbers (avaliable online, or in the mailer you get with the card). Paypal then deposits about $.10 into the account, check it online and verify.
* Wait ninety days, then apply for the PayPal debit card, set up backup funding to the direct deposit account. Make sure the first transaction is small, and actually works (make sure there is money on the debit card). Then go on a spending spree with the card (get about $1000 this way). Then just throw away the debit card and ignore the warnings for collections from PayPal; they won't do anything. Seriously. Eventually they'll just close the account. Make a new one and start over!
* [[PROFIT!]]

==Alternative Method to Rip Off GayPal==

*  Open A GayPal account, start as above with a Greendot/Walmart Money Card, Add and confirm both the Direct Deposit + Debit card sides.  Supposedly Greendot freezes your card if they see PayPal on it so be careful.
*  Buy an item on ebay or wherever, making sure it goes through on your debit card. This shows GayPal that the debit card works.
*  Buy stuff from places that take GayPal instant transfers (i.e. Newegg.com, Buy.com).  MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE TOTAL UNDER $1000, OR THEY WILL SKULLFUCK YOUR ORDERS.
*  They will obviously fail at some point, so make sure and get Next Day Fuck Yea Shipping.

==GayPal Protips==

*  Use a Gmail Address if you intend on creating multiple accounts, because you can use it to create multiple email addresses by adding dots (em.ail@gmail.com) or adding + and words to the end (email+gaypal@gmail.com)
*  If you ever have a message in the Resolution Center that requires your feedback, send them the [[Offended]] images for great [[lulz]].
