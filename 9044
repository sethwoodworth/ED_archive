Wikipe-tan
[[Image:Neko Wikipe-tan.png|thumb|So [[retard|kawaii]] ^____________^]]

[[At least 100]] years ago, '''Wikipe-tan''' was created by a [[srsly|Japanese]] [[tartlet]] named {{deviantart|Kasuga39|Kasuga39}}. She is the personification of [[Wikipedia]] and is used to lure [[weeaboos]]. Wikipe-tan and her sisters are the only things on Wikipedia that are worth [[raping]]. She is [[failing|trying]] to destroy ED and all of its [[lulz]], but so far has only fanned the flames by bringing attention to Wikipedia's colossal amount of [[pedophiles]].

==History==
===Prelude===
[[Image:Wikipe-tan (Cosplay).jpg|thumb|[[IRL]] Wikipe-tan]]

In 2003, Wikipedia was still young, and [[Jimbo Whails]] knew that his tiny, fragile index of knowledge could fail in an instant. [[Larry Sanger]] left the year before, and the [[trolls]] were moving in. He needed a catalyst or a symbol to bring everyone together under his flag, but he also needed one of those too. The Wikimedia Foundation decided that a mascot was needed, and Whails decided that the users should choose the mascot in true wiki fashion.

On February 21, 2003, a mascot election was held. Numerous [[furries|anthropomorphic creatures]] contented [[for the win]]. On September 6, 2003, [[Centipede|Wikipede the Centipede]] was declared the [[winner]] and was given his own [[article]]. Despite this, the election was never closed, and the voting continued on for [[at least a hundred]] years.

===Conception===
On January 4, 2006, Wikipedia's most brilliant anon [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_mascot&diff=prev&oldid=265387 suggested] that Wikipedia use an [[anime]] character in the same spirit as the [[OS-tan]]s. This anon also suggested the name "Wikipe-tan". Kasuga then then created and drew Wiki-tan on January 8 and uploaded it onto the [[Futaba Channel]]. On January 17, 2006, [[Shii]] (then known as [[Ashibaka]]) discovered the image and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=Shii&page=File%3AWikipe-tan.png&year=2006&month=1 uploaded Kasuga's artwork onto Commons]. He then [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_mascot&diff=next&oldid=272812 added the artwork to the ballot]. Despite all the weeaboos voting for Wikipe-tan, Wikipede the Centipede still had about ten more votes and won. Some critics decided to be [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_mascot&action=historysubmit&diff=1248306&oldid=1040835 butthurt].

===Mascothood===
Although Wikipe-tan [[lose|lost the mascot battle]] to a mascot, Wikipe-tan developed a strong [[personal army|fanbase]], and Wikipede remained obscured to the greater Wikipedian community. Wikipe-tan became the official mascot of several wiki projects, including the wiki's anime project.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lolicon&diff=46853805&oldid=46851498 Since April 3, 2006], Wikipedia's Lolicon article used "[[Final Solution|File:Final_Solution-chan.jpg]]" as its introductory image, but on June 1, 2007, [[Anonymous]] decided to change it, and this led to one of the greatest edit wars in Wikipedia's history (depicted in the following table):

Several channers (and possibly their [[sockpuppets]]) competed for supremacy over the article. Just when it appeared that the status quo would be preserved, "4lolicon" appeared and uploaded "File:Loliwikipetan.jpg". Merovingian approved of the image and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lolicon&diff=135154502&oldid=135123633 added it to the article]. Unbeknownst to him, this image will become the source of the edit war's next phrase. Merovingian, Erachima (then known as tjstrf), and Eyrian in favor of the new Wikipe-tan lolicon, while Herostratus was heavily against it. Merovingian and Herostratus became engaged in a deletion-restoration war, but this ended since Herostratus couldn't delete images on Commons.

On July 4, 2007, White_Cat [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Deletion_requests/Wikipe-tan_lolicon_%282007-01-04%29 nominated] "File:LoliWikipetan.jpg" and "File:LoliWikipetan2.jpg" for deletion. Even more drama [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lolicon/Archive_11#A_new_image.3F occurred on Talk:Lolicon]. Nevertheless, the thoughts expressed in these discussions were rendered meaningless when [[Jimbo Wales]] unilaterally [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=Jimbo_Wales&year=2007&month=6 deleted the lolicon images] and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&page=User%3A4lolicon permabanned 4lolicon].

==Urbanesque Wikipe-tan==
[[Image:Nigrapedia.png|thumb|upright|Urbanesque Wikipe-tan.[[Pool's Closed|Wikipedia's Closed]]]]
[[Image:Wikichan logo.png|thumb|Wikipe-tan in Wikichan.org's logo]]

{{Quote|Wikipe-tan is shown here with a tan and an afro inspired by [[wikipedia:User:GunnarRene|GunnarRene]]'s pending trip to [[wikipedia:Australia|Australia]].|The excuse used to upload the image|[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Afro-wikipe-tan2.png]}}

During the summer of 2007, [[wikipedia:User:GunnarRene|GunnarRene]] made an amazing discovery: Due to Wikipe-tan's liberal licensing, anyone can create an derivative of Wikipe-tan and upload it onto Commons. GunnarRene then took [[wikipedia:File:Paranormal wikipe-tan.png|Paranormal Wikipe-tan]] and transformed it into a minority, which came complete with an afro, a suit, and shades. <code>[[JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR!|:3]]</code> can also be seen on Urbanesque Wikipe-tan's puzzle hair-piece.

The [[Wikichan|Wikichan.org]] ([[not to be confused with]] Wikichan.net) crew found the image and fact the the [[Wikipedos]] did not complain about it yet [[lulzy]]. The Wikichan crew then added this information to their Wikipe-tan article and used Wikipe-tan in their logo as a sign of victory.

The Wikipedos did not realize the [[meme]] reference until months later. The anon who finally made the meme-connection had this to say:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">
<p>I feel that the afro wikipe-tans should be removed as they seem to be some kind of joke from 4chan. They are a reference to the racist <s>'[http://wikichan.org/index.php/Pool%27s_closed pool's closed]'</s> ([[Wikichan]] is gone, see [[Pool's Closed]]) (NSFW) meme (note the current wikichan logo).</p>

<p>Images in question: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Afro-wikipe-tan2.png] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Afro-wikipe-tan3.png] [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Transparent_Afro-wikipe-tan.png]</p>

<p>Additionally, see 'afro controversy' in this wikichan [http://wikichan.org/index.php/Wikipe-tan article] (NSFW):</p>

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">An art piece featuring Wikipe-tan wearing a suit, shades, and an afro was added to the gallery, with a caucasian and alternate black version. Fortunately, no one was keen enough to guess its meaning or delete it, and it remains there to this day. An edited version is seen on the WikiChan logo as a symbol of triumph. Really, you can add whatever the hell you want to the gallery. Go ahead.</blockquote>

<p>How these pictures have been up for 5 months perplexes me. :(</p></blockquote>

After some debate, the [[OP]] said:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">Original poster here. I guess the images themselves don't really create any harm as long as they aren't breaking any rules, even if they are a bit strange. For those who do not know, Wikichan is the official wiki of the *chans, which are a collection of imageboards famous for their 'raids' on websites. See [[wikipedia:4chan|4chan]] for a list of things that one such imageboard have been responsible for. Being associated with these people may be a bad idea, which is why I suggest the removal of the references to their 'pool's closed' meme. Additionally, allowing these images to stay up may lead to further 'contributions' by 4chan when they realize what they can get away with. Finally, I don't really see how a dark-skinned version of wikipe-tan with an afro belongs in the gallery, but hey, I respect people's different tastes. Ultimately, I respect the majority decision.</blockquote>

==Anti-anime movement==
Although Wikipedia is filled with many anime-loving weeaboos, Wikipedia also has its fair share of [[OCD]]-driven anime-[[h8]]rs. Haters of everything [[manga]] constantly besiege Wikipedia’s Wikipe-tan project page. The project page was proposed for deletion twice: once on July 20, 2006, and again on July 14, 2008. The second attempt to delete the article was by an "[[sockpuppet|dummy account]]" (own words) named "Anon deletion", and he had this to say:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">This page is completely and utterly ridiculous. An entire page dedicated to the "worship" of a childish drawing. If you think "worship" is too strong a word check out some of the David-Brent-level-cringe-factor comments on the talkpage. ''This user loves Wikipe-tan, the cutest personification of Wikipedia.'' is extremely apt - but whatever happened to ''This user loves Wikipedia - the free encyclopedia'' - that's what we're here for, not an extended anime fan club!! Given the deletion of that great Esperanza project on the basis it was distracting people and creating a socialized wiki culture I don't see how this can possibly be retained. It has no positive benefit for the project at all - why is it the namespace? Reason: it would get deleted as an article for a lack of notability.  It's just a list of the uses of wikipetan and numerous derivative images. I honestly find it sickening that such an article exists on our encyclopedia. And before the accusations start flying yes this is just a dummy account (AFAIK this isn't against "the rules") as I'd prefer not to be a marked man by Wikipe-tan fans.</blockquote>

Although the Wikipe-tan project page survived, the anti-anime users continued to assault the article on the [[talk page]].

|Hey guys. I have to say, reading this page makes me cringe for Wikipedia. Pages like this go to reinforce the stereotype of Wikipedia contributors as being anime-obsessed geeks, and diminish the perceived credibility and reliability of the rest of the site. What does an image of a child-like anime figure have to do with an encyclopedia?|[Anon]
|Hahaha, I concur [Anon]. What an utter waste of time this wench is. Perhaps it would be appropriate for wikipedians to jettison this strumpet and allot more time to the augmentation of articles. Though, alas, [Anon], we must sadly cope with the fact that most wikipedians are artless creatures who fail at rendering this encyclopedia an elegant entity.|Grammaticus VII before censoring himself.

|what's that, the weeaboo asperger teen baby can't understand how this is creepy as fuck, especially because he feels the need to spring to the defense of his beloved Wikipe-tan the moment anyone dares to make an edit to it? this isn't notable. it adds nothing to wikipedia. there is no value added by this article or by this character's existance, but because it makes you guys feel better it will never be deleted. HOW DARE SOMEONE ATTACK PRECIOUS WIKIPE-TAN.|Anon
|This whole section and the mascot itself only reinforces the stereotypes about Wikipedia's contributors/editors (i.e. obsessive japanophiles). Not to mention that the sheer amount of images and their style seems as if this page was a misplaced DeviantArt profile of a horrible basement dweller.

Is there any reason why is "Wikipe-tan"(why should we even use japanese honorifics? They hold no meaning in the english language and I haven't seen honorifics of any other language used anywhere) should be present at all,much less drawn in the frankly horrible "moe" style,or even worse,in sexually suggestive poses/clothing?

Probably got bot-deleted,reposting. I'm genuinely curious why have you picked "moe" to be the style of the mascot instead of any other. Was there a vote? Have you considered more classical/western styles? I just believe there are better ways to summarize the effort for making a free for all database of all knowledge than some overly cute girl lacking any real human proportions.|Anon

Things that anime-haters forget include:
#Wikipedia:Wikipe-tan is a project page, not an article.
#Wikipe-tan is not Wikipedia's official mascot. It is a community-supported mascot.
#Kasuga is actually [[Japanese]]; therefore, Kasuga is not [[wapanese]].
#[[Ad hominem]] attacks against weeaboos do not work.
#Wikipedia is not [[Why do you hate America|Americentric]].
#Wikipedia is not going to change into an anime fansite due to a mascot.
