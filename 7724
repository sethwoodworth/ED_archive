Special K

'''Ketamine''' ('''Special K''' is an old junkie term that only [[Cops|The Fuzz]] still use. Good way to tell them and junkie newbz apart) is a dissociative [[drug]]. Contrary to popular belief, ketamine does not lower blood pressure; instead, it can have a wide range of effects ranging from hallucinations to actually enjoying techno <s>music</s>, much like a [[raver]]. It can come in a variety of names and packages ranging from ketamine animal tranquilizer (KAT) to "special edition with strawberries". Users of ketamine may actually become [[ravers]] after prolonged usage. Ravers may attempt to cook ketamine in your oven while you are not looking.  Ketamine is also known to cause people to feel and act like they have [[Down Syndrome]], often sitting in one spot for hours on end completely unaware they have the ability to move, or turn off the crappy music. On average, a "K-hole", the ketamine high, lasts between 15-25 minutes to 3 hours, give or take. When put up the Jew, ketamine can cause '''minor''' capillary failure, meaning you're going to bleed like a [[bitch|son of a bitch]] for a short while. The effects are often compared to being drunk, after drinking about 48 beers. As a result you will get a headache and probably end up passed out on the street because you're taking fucking tranquilizers. Ketamine can be found at most [[Techno|dubstep]] shows, [[Irony|neo-hippie]] jam festivals, and where the asian kids hide awaiting the return of their lord and savior [[tubgirl]] in the dark corners of some shitty club.

[[Shit nobody cares about|Fun fact]]: Ketamine made [[House]] 'think' he could walk (This lasted for no more than 99 seconds, resulting in butthurt and [[anti-lulz]])
Ketamine was used by [[addict|researcher]] John C. Lilly to communicate with dolphins, maybe because of their interesting [[rape|sexual behavior]]; See PCP below.
