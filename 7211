Names: Samael, warlord101, Robert Brettell

In the vast reaches of the [[InterWeb]], there are many [[retards|people]] from many different [[fetish|parts]] all over les [[tubes]]. One such [[retard]] is Samael. Oozing from the dark abyss of [[Fur Affinity]], Samael is a 20-year-old [[British]] [[furfag]] who draws [[inflation]] porn of his completely [[original character]], a "butter [[dragon]]". [[Some argue]] that his [[fursona]] is actually just a fat yoshi, but they are obviously spreading [[truth|slanderous lies]] because they're jealous of his [[fat fuck|fatceps, quadruple chin and moobs.]] He is [[fap|worshipped]] as a [[shit|talented]] [[vore]] and inflation artist by [[furries]] everywhere, even though he is a retarded piece of shit with a fetish for bed-sore causing health problems and respiratory failure.


==Within the fandom==

===Characters===

Samael joined the furry fandom at the [[Underage b&|tender age of 16]]. He almost immediately started spamming tons of [[shit|sketches]], to which [[dumbasses|furries]] slowly flocked in order to [[fap|observe]] his [[fat|brilliant artistic talents]].

Samael's [[fursona]] is a butter dragon. To anybody that isn't one of Samael's [[fantards]], they can see that his 'butter dragon' is actually just a fat yellow yoshi with wings and a hat stuck on. Despite this, he has (at the time of writing) 954 watchers and over 30,000 pageviews, meaning that either Samael has a lot of online friends willing to view his page all the time or a LOT of furfags fap to blobs of living fat weighing in at over two metric tons. Hope for the former but expect the latter.

Older DeviantArt entries suggest that he had a [[gay|mate]], [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/spencerdragon spencerdragon]. However, spencerdragon ditched his furaffinity over two years ago, most likely along with his [[buttsex|mateship]].

The name Samael was [[stolen|liberated]] from an old video game called ''Discworld Noir''.

{{quote|I think I actually first heard it in 'Discworld Noir' - the pianist was called Samael, I seem to think.

"Play it again, Samael."
"*pauses and turns around* ...nobody is ever going to believe you said that."|Samael on his fursona's name.}}

Another one of his favourite characters is Tia, a [[xbox|hueg]] [[Snakes on a Plane|boa constrictor]] with anatomy comparable to an oil pipeline. Tia is Samael's [[Original character|original]] variation of the [[Iraq|Babylonian]] sea goddess Tiamat, the [[Dungeons & Dragons|monstrous embodiment]] of primordial chaos.

===Art Style===

The majority of his works of "art" are little more than pencil sketches of circles with blobs for arms and legs and a head stuck on somewhere in the fatrolls. [[Furfags]] for some [[It is a mystery|as of yet unknown]] reason, furfags are actually [[retarded]] enough to [[PROFIT|pay]] for these [[shit|drawings]]. Again, anybody that isn't a [[cult|fan]] of him can see that his pictures suck. Even Samael himself can see that he's not a good artist, as demonsrated below.

|I think I can finally start referring to myself as a drawing machine again. Not necessarily a GOOD drawing machine but a machine none the less.| Samael on how he's a mediocre artist|I seem to have lost my direction and whatever I draw comes out poor and feeling horrendously incomplete.|Samael on how he's a mediocre artist continued|But, clearly, there is something I'm doing wrong. Perhaps there's some glaring aspect of my style that I'm just not picking up on that seems simply 'not right' or I've just botched something so often that it's gotten ingrained.|[[Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhh|WELL GEE I WONDER WHAT THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE]]|Have I done something to offend you all?|Yes, they are all in your gallery|Unless it's my art, in which the same thing gets repeated about three hundred times.
Anyway, those who know me will probably know that I'm a fickle, hidebound creature that seldom ventures out of a certain comfort zone. Unless I'm being vocal about something, I appear to have no personality, lack initiative and prove myself thoroughly uncultured.|do I REALLY need to say anything?|Firstly, I'm pretty sure fat eevees have been drawn before.
Secondly, my art is not good, not great, not exceptional. At the MOST it is mediocre.
Thirdly, what works better? Flat colours or the fully-shaded thing? |mediocre artist is mediocre|color=#ffffff}}


==Point System==
Samael thought of the [[Retarded|brilliant]] idea of giving points to his [[fantard]]s for anything to get art off him, but him being a total Jew about it he pretty much played favourites and was being very selective about who the points went to. He played the point game from 17 March [[2008]] to 21 May 2008. There are however [[over 9000|over nine-thousand]] journal entries about how many [[fantards|people]] have certain numbers of points. [[raptor jesus|God]] and Samael only know how much arse-kissing went on during those two months.

{{quote|Just a little note to say, I thought up a little contest, regarding my pics.
You know how I sometimes award points? And so far they don't really mean anything aside from credit?
From now on, every picture I post will have a question, usually related to the pic or just random trivia related to whatever's going through my mind when I post it, that'll be worth a point.
Furthermore, from now on, those points are currency. Gather up enough - I'm thinking ten - and you're awarded free arts.

Sound worthwhile to anyone?| Samael being the Jew he always is}}

After a while he pretty much Jewed everyone over the points program by scrapping it without notice, and in the end result no art this shows how much of a self centered arsehole he really is.

A brief overview of his FA page shows that he has over 850 [[Shitty art|pics]] in his [[fail|gallery]], mostly comprised of inflation porn of his fat ass yoshi ripoff.
