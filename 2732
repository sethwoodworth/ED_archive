'''Eurovision''', [[Europe]]'s <s>largest song contest</s> ''only'' song contest, has over the saddening years of its existence turned further and further into a [[fellatio|full-blown]] [[homosexual|gay parade]]. It is and has always been the [[poop|sticky jam]] holding [[Europe]] together. It acts as a chance for all countries in [[Europe]] to get [a <s>lucky</s> few members] together as a [[lie|happy love family]] in one big stadium . The contest itself is actually based around a sick kind of [[American Idol|variety singing show]] as may be found in the likes of [[Britain]] or [[America]]; the only difference being that it's the whole of [[rich|non-feudal]] Europe taking part, and instead of the [[Albania|foreigners who can't sing]] being voted off immediately, in the Eurovision Song Contest [[fail|they win]]! 

{{Quote|To participate in Eurovision is like running in the Special Olympics - even if you win, you're still retarded.|The old saying|stolen from somewhere else.}}  

The show lasts for a an entire evening and occurs once every year, around late May/early June - the timing is thought to be because most [[poor|host countries]] depart into either [[shit nobody cares about|a civil-war, a nuclear-winter, or some other kind of anarchy usually related to the West stealing their resources]]. 

==History==

[[Image:Dimabilan.jpg|thumb|A totally [[not gay]] [[Russian]] act.]]

Eurovision came into being after Hitler killed some people for the lulz in some place [[at least 100 years ago]], with the effect of making [[Europe]]an pussies feel sad. The Contest is considered the most heinous result of [[WW2]]. A Swiss person (most likely [[Josef Fritzl]] in disguise) began thinking that the best way to cheer up a continent was to play some sixth-rate foreign songs one night every year in a massive [[TL;DW]] program. It was a great success for many years until [[slut|Celine Dion]] entered. 

It continually grows slowly more [[ghey]], reaching its pinnacle in [[Finland|Failand]], Helsinki, 2006, where the Ukraine created mega-lulz through their fail-faggotry performance. 2010 is expected to top our gaydar results with performances almost three-times gayer than the last three years put together!

== Voting Patterns ==

[[Image:French Eurovision.jpg|thumb|right|Srsly, this is what the French entered - <s>not good for stereotypes.</s> Why the hell are they wearing clothes that use the British flag?]]

Of course the majority of votes come from [[France]] - given most of Eastern Europe can't vote due to lack of technology - [[England]] is too busy with [[Britain's Got Talent]], [[Spain]]'s population are too [[poor|Spanish]] to care, while Germany doesn't vote out of fear that they reveal their [[racist]] nature towards the [[fag|Slav]]s of [[Poland]] who they [[WW2|pwned some time ago]]...This leaves only France and those other [[Italy|shitty cling-on countries]] to '''not-vote-for-England''', mainly due to the fact [[George Bush]] was once in charge of [[Tony Blair]] who was once in charge of [[Britain]], plus they feel sorry for [[Saddam Hussein]].

Eurovision is literally the only world affair America can't pry open, this bothers them immensely. They get jealous and bitchfit at England every late May; over the next month this jealousy builds and Americunts get moody and angsty at being left out, so decide to celebrate ''not'' being British anymore by [[Independence Day|destroying the ozone-layer with lots of fire-works on July 4th]] and blames it on[[Skippyland down under]]. The British then feel sorry for their [[America|obese-spoilt-child]] and make up by licking their President's [[ass]]. [[shit nobody cares about|See, Eurovision has more effect on politics than you may think!]]

==The Contestants==
Of course to [[retard|win Eurovision]] is not the same as [[win]]ning in [[RL]], for as everyone knows;

The only way you can actually take part without being a retard, is if you [[lolly|fail so hard you automatically win]]; surprisingly enough, there have been acts like this, mostly out of [[epic win]] countries like The [[Ukraine]] or [[Finland]], where natural talent is just so rare [[clitoris|it actually hurts when you find it]].  

There are several types of weeners to be found on Eurovision, each participant's potential defects into one of the following:

*[[politics|The Political Weener]]; Participants voted for by gay Parisian liberals, often out of pity for that country or hatred of another, for example "Ah Hatrod le Britannia, le votey Malta!" (Non-Frog: I hate Britain - let's vote Malta). The only country not voted for in this category is Britain. No matter what. Ever, eveer, eveeer. 

*[[Albania|The Poor Weener]]; Countries in the Balkans or Eastern Europe voted for by Western Europeans feeling pitiful that they forgot to tip their [[immigrant|cleaning lady]] [[last thursday]]. These acts often cannot sing but come anyway.

*[[Retro|The Old Weener]]; Countries like [[Finland]] who've forgotten what it's like to be cool and up to date, these countries rely on Fashion tips from places like [[Sweden]] and therefore are at least twenty years out-of-date in the ''wrong'' direction. Surprisingly these come scarily close to winning, or even winning(!) as seen in the contest of 2006 - won by a hard-rock "''monster''" band from [[fail|Finland]].

*[[fail|The Epic Fail Weener]]; The most common and ergo '''best''' type of winner, however they often lose due to shitty [[French]] people on the other end of the telephone. These participants are deemed fail by the entire Eurovision audience (and that's saying something), this creates a phenomena where something fails so hard that it actually stops failing and becomes [[win]]. These are the lulziest of all acts and get the vote of [[/b/]] and many more. The most [[cock|nobbable]] of this category came from Ukraine in 2007.

[[Image:AlexanderRybak.jpg|200px|thumb|right|<s>[[Oh exploitable]]</s>. Not.]] 

The year 2009 provided a strange - more [[sex|salty]]; less [[Russian]] - taste to the contest, given that surprisingly this year, [[lolwut|Britain got voted for]]! They finished in (joint)  fourth position, higher than their last score of [[zero]]!

While other [[fail|shitty]] countries continued to be voted for by their [[ukraine|communist allies]], Norway, in a strange natural - [[rainbow|Northern Lights]] related phenomenon - finished first place with a score [[suicide|topping]] the last topping score. Their chosen singer, [[thirteen-year-old boy]] [[Alexander Rybak]] - already famed for his yaoi series ''[[yaoi|Sensitive Pornography]]'' (fapfapfap). He won with the song ''fairytale'' - now played on loop throughout Europe, even in fucking Crete of all places.
