'''LJ killers''' are a group of people who have committed [[murder]]s or other heinous crimes and wrote entries on their [[LiveJournal]]s to tell about it.

Most LJ killers were unremarkable until their crimes became public.  As the majority of LiveJournal users are unremarkable, any given LJ user is likely to be a violent criminal.  If you see a man that is completely normal (All LJ killers  LOOK normal) report him to the police, and write about your encounter on your blog.
