FUCKING GAMESTOP!

'''FUCKING GAMESTOP!''' is a typical thread starter regularly found on [[V/|/v/]] where [[Virgin|gamers]] tell about a usual bad experience they've had at GameStop. Then followed by are other people's experiences to the store which is king of bullshit which again generally are bad.

The reason there are many of these threads is because gamestop is a shit hole which run by [[virgin]]s and [[neckbeard]]s, however at least one under qualified female is hired per store as by law. Not for their knowledge of video games but their bra size and [[Hooters]] experience. [[Truth|GameStop is the most evil corporation in the world.]] They [[Steal|buy]] back used videogames for <s>[[over 9000]]</s> less than a dollar and then proceed to sell them back at ten times that cost. However, it's quite ironic how people make these threads considering they will probably work there in the future (but hey, at least it's  better then where [[You|you'll]] be working in the future, at [[McDonald's]]). I strongly advise you that if you are buying a [[Video Game|video game]], go to [[Wal-Mart]] to get it, even if the employee know's nothing about gaming and he has just returned from the Meat Department after cutting off his own pinky.

'''Warning: When visiting GameStop, you will be surrounded by the smell of nerd-sweat. Enter at your own risk.'''

==How to troll FUCKING GAMESTOP!==
The best way to [[troll]] the store is doing a [[Pwned|'gamestop rental']] which is the act of going to gamestop and <s>buying</s> "renting" a used game, completeing the game and then returning it within 7 days for a full refund.

Doing it wrong:

>Go to GameStop

>Buy Halo Reach for [[Rip-off|$59.99]]

>[[No life|Complete game]]

>Return 8 days later and not returning it within 7 days for a full refund

>Go batshit and sell it back to them pre-owned for [[scam|$6.99]] then they sell it for $49.99
