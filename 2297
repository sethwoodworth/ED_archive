'''Divide by zero''' is yet another [[meme]] from the kind [[pedophile]]s at [[fail|4chan]]. It is said to be highly dangerous, containing the power to open up [[Sheneequa|black holes]], [[Goatse|rend time, space, and mathematics to pieces]] and even cause the [[Chicago Cubs]] to win the World Series. (It can even cause a [[pools closed|chanapocalypse]].) It causes dozens of people to post either [[retarded]] reasons why you cannot divide by zero (which are usually wrong), or extremely retarded reasons why you can actually divide by zero. These /b/tards have not realized that the whole of mathematics and reality is against them. It is also a fantastic way to generate [[drama]] amongst numerophilic [[aspies]] on the [[Slashdot]] forums. Most of the time, '''Divide by zero''' will be used by little children who just got into high school, discovered the internet, and now think that '''Divide by zero''' is original and hilarious.

The common phrase is usually '''"I divided by zero. OSHII--"'''.

==Theories and Conjecture==
[[Image:Result of a division by 0.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Not even Math is safe.]]

[[Contrary to popular belief]], dividing a constant by zero does not equal infinity, except in regards to limits. While [[some argue]] that dividing by zero is both impossible and meaningless, there are still others who believe it to be [http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2006/12/06/divide_zero_feature.shtml possible].  Regardless of the possibility of division by zero, one consensus can be reached; if anyone were to ever complete this mathematical computation, universe-ending paradox would ensue destroying anything and everything.

Division itself has features of a tangent function, but works in the opposite direction. Division by zero is the point at which the result is both everything and nothing, just like tan90. It is shown in this [[:Image:Div0excel.PNG|picture]].

Sometimes, catastrophic events can happen when you even only THINK about dividing by zero:

:'''<RichLow> CAN YOU DIVIDE BY ZERO???'''
:'''<kardus> yes'''
:'''<kardus> watch'''
:'''<Not_Sir_Compuret_of_Computron> Yes.'''
:'''<kardus> OH SHI--'''
:'''<nowiki>*</nowiki> kardus has quit IRC (Quit: )'''

The invention of [[Science|Nullity]] to solve 1/0 = ? has generated a wave of new numbers, all of which are useful for the good of mankind. For example, [[Pi]] is no longer equal to [[Pi|3.14159265358979323]] and so on. Rather, it is now equal to '''Eleventeen.''' Successfully dividing by zero results in excessive undirects, and often indirects, and occasionally [[Goatse|redirects]].

It is [[common knowledge]] that [[Hawt|Kari Byron]] of the [[Mythbusters]] [[Lie|died]] on June 16, [[2007]] while attempting to divide by zero. It is also [[common knowledge]] that [[Mythbusters]] and [[Math|mathematicians]] are idiots.  

[[Some argue]] that our universe, and the big bang that started it all, might be the result of an [[newfag|individual]] in an alternate universe who divided by zero.

By studying the image righthand, we can tell that division by zero makes logical sense only if "a" is equal to zero.








<s>BREAKING NEWS!

I've concluded that dividing by zero would result in a answer similar to that of multiplying by 1. e.g., Divide ONE brownie by 0. 0 = nothing, thus you are saying divide one brownie by nothing, thus resulting in the brownie, yes I just divided by zero, and yes, by the power of my awesome brain, I hereby declare "the game" null and void.

Good day sirs! toodles~</s>

Good sir, mathematics has decided that you are a bellend, know nothing of its complexity, write [[tl;dr]] and should immediately become [[an hero]]

==Division by Zero Possible?==

Any number divided by zero should result in end of universe. 

  X/0=.....

<nowiki>O SHI-</nowiki>

(This, of course, [[some argue|is debatable]], as the content of this article [[WTF|has contained division by zero at least 10 times already]], [[O RLY?|and we aren't all dead yet...]])

an interesting result is if you divide 0 by 0, then

  0/0=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,...,[[Numberwang|over 9000, positive infinity, negative infinity, 3i+1 and all other numbers both real and imaginary]]

<nowiki>FUCKING SWEET, PUT ON HOME WORK ALWAYS RIGHT!!!</nowiki>

But wait! Think of as a pie, x/0 = x, You cut the pie 0 times. So you get a whole
Just like multiplying by one

== Division by zero will always create a contradiction ==

{{blueblink|New and improved proof!}}

[[TL;DR]]

To see the most simple example, we begin with:

  A/B = C

Now, we choose B to be equal to 0, and A will be equal to 3 as in the Trinity (any non zero number). C will be left undefined, as its value does not matter. Our equation now reads:

  3/0 = C

  A/B = C can be rewritten as:

  A = B*C

Plugging in our variables, we get:

  3 = 0*C

  3 = 0

The rearrangement was needed to avoid having to deal with the indeterminate.

As proven, any time a division by zero happens, a contradiction will always be formed. This means you may not divide by zero, as it will always create something that is [[truth|untrue]].

== Indeterminate ==

The exception to the rule of dividing by zero yielding a contradiction is zero divide by zero. This is of the form called "indeterminate." It is called this because it 0/0 falls under two different mathematical rules. The two rules are:

:a/a = 1

and

:0/a = 0

0/0 is under both of those. Since neither has precedence over the other, we call 0/0 indeterminate. The indeterminate family has many other members, such as infinity / infinity. To be a member of this family, two different rules must apply to the same equation.

== Actual Mathematical Approach to Dividing by Zero ==
 
[[nerd|Therefore, for all intents and purposes, when presented with any number divided by zero we say the product is undefined. But if zero is divided by zero we say the answer is indeterminate. For example:]]

   [[nerd|0/5 = 0]]
   [[nerd|5/0 = undefined]] (It just [[DO NOT WANT|doesn't fucking exist]]!)
   [[nerd|0/0 = indeterminate]]

==Non-Mathematical Approach to Dividing by Zero==
When you divide a shape into 4 you add 2 lines through the middle (adding to the outline). Divide by 2, 1 line. Divide by 1 no lines. Divide by 0, no outline. In other words, the confines of reality within the shape, cease to be, and the actual value is everything together, which would lead one to suggest that it's infinity, but it's not, [[retard]], [[bullshit|it's the biggest number possible (one which we don't know).]]
== Other math ==
Zero is not part of the division group. Dividing by zero is like attempting to rotate a figure by fish degrees. It's like trying to find a whole number between 3 and 4.

==An Exception==
In [[Communist|Soviet Russia]] Zero Divides by [[YOU]]!
