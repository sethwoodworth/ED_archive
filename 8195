The GIMP
[[Image:Getgimp.jpg|thumb|right|Another Gimp you could get]]
'''GIMP''' (Poor Man's Photoshop) is an image editor based loosely off of [[MS Paint]]. As the name suggests, it is pretty much [[retarded]]; the only people who use it are [[neckbeard|Linux users]] and [[Mac|Macfags]], as they cannot run [[Photoshop]] and [[MS Paint]] respectively, or poor people who cannot [[steal|afford]] Photoshop. 

This program is a classic example of ''you get what you pay for'': being as it is free.  As if anybody pays for Photoshop.

The screenshot at right is [[MS Paint|the most advanced version of GIMP]]. It contains features such as the paintbrush, the pencil tool, and the almighty "Script-Fu". The Script-Fu is an omnipotent power feature that is a marvel even unto its developers. To properly understand  the Script-Fu, one must know all things Scheme and learn how to think in multi-coloured fractals instead of in one's native programming language. The Script-Fu is not to be taken lightly&mdash;mess with it and prepare to die. GIMP even features more colours than [[MS Paint]]! You can also download new brushes from [[DeviantART|other places]].

Keep in mind that MS Paint, the lame [[Microsoft]] image editor, while superior to GIMP for the quickest and nastiest jobs, does not offer the godly Script-Fu.

It cannot be overstated how much GIMP's user interface sucks. It uses three windows: one for drawing, one for toolbars, and one for more toolbars. GIMP is able to do more than Photoshop, but it's not like learning to ride a bicycle once you've figured out how, unless you do the [[girl]]y thing, and [[RTFM|read the manual]] and figure out how to put all the toolbars in one window. Even if you do that, the Script-Fu and version changes will [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|obliterate you with a laser]].

In other words, the program's name is very ([[lol]]) appropriate.

=GIMPshop: Still too cheap to <s>buy</s> steal Photoshop=
For those who want Photoshop, but are still too much of a Jew or [[Republican]] to buy or pirate Photoshop, GIMPshop tries its best to make you forget you are using a sub-par MS Paint clone. Essentially, its a windowed version of the same shit, making it possibly even more crippling.

=Gimp Users=
[[Image:Ggpic.png|thumb|right|This guy loves GIMP!]]
A majority of GIMP users are too honest or too [[pussy]] to pirate the commercial programs from the [[internets]]. GIMP is supported on multiple platforms, providing [[Porn|wank fodder]] for GNU groupies who cannot install Lunix. 

[[CrimsonNightshade]] is known for [[Raping|utilizing]] the various features of GIMP.

Note that GIMP project's mascot is a balloon head of a lame hybrid of a coyote or something and [[Mickey Mouse]]. Its name is [http://www.gimp.org/about/linking.html Wilber.]  This proves that the GIMP is mainly written by [[furry]] programmers so that their artistically inclined furry friends can create better [[Goatse|furry porn]].

A hilarious point is that the creators of GIMP project were actually two programmers with no artistic talent, so they incessantly bothered the only incredible graphic artist they knew for splash screen art.  Even worse is that they demanded it be drawn in '''their software''' to show off its incredible potential.

After putting the project off for weeks while trying to figure out exactly what the hell he was going to draw, he finally said 'fuck it', and drew the gayest [[furry]] mascot he could imagine.
