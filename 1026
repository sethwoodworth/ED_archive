'''Bleach''' is an [[anime]] series, with [[at least 100|over two hundred episodes and counting]], with a name that makes no sense.  The only reason we have an article is that hordes of angry [[weeaboo|waps]] like to argue about the name and [[Rule 34|draw cartoons of the fourteen-year-old orange-haired girl with giant tits]]. It is the epitome of self-aggrandizing, mastubatory power-fantasy material, beating the [[gay|epic]] [[Naruto]] due to the fact that [[13_year_old_boy|13 year olds]] would rather identify with an adolescent boy than some [[Faggot|Awesome]] ninja. Bleach follows a simple but effective 'expanding fetish-focus' formula for luring in the asinine punters, to be found in an increasing amount of [[anime|animu]] and mango. Want to make a shit ton of cash? Base the entire series around a sequence of non-fatal one-on-one fights and follow these rules:


'''1: [[Mary Sue|THE PUPPET]]'''

Begin your shitty series with a protagonist utterly devoid of personality or interesting visual features in a comparitively interesting fantasy setting. He must be male and between the ages of 13 and 18. Got a good idea for your guy? Fucking scrap it. Your protagonist must be a 'catch-all,' uninteresting enough to allow the average teenage dolt to place himself in his shoes. Don't let him talk too much or express insight: anything that you might deem interesting will alienate or intellectually challenge members of your solid fan base. Stock emotional responses and the blandest 'special power' ('energy blasts', for example) you can think of should ensure that gormless youths can imprint themselves onto your faceless puppet. Do not develop him and ensure his only motivation is 'protecting his friends' or 'being the strongest.' After all, who the fuck can't identify with that? Oh right, this is ED.  Don't forget to make him '''immortal''', like [[Naruto|other]] [[Dragon Ball Z|animes]] do!  Who wants to see someone die every chapter?

[[Image:Leekspin.gif|thumb|right|]]
'''2: THE SUPPORTING CAST'''

Introduce a supporting cast of stock characters. Each one consists of ONE stock archetype OR has ONE noticable personality trait or ability. As your fan-base grows it will begin to include individuals who find it difficult to identify with your protagonist. This could even include more intellectual types who demand character depth, but it probably just involves insipid [[emo|'anti-conformists']] who react against the stock fan base. They now have a moderately more advanced character to fantasize about being - your fetish net has expanded. These supporting characters cannot develop and any change must be an absolutely predictable one so as to ensure that your fans are unsatisfied but not dissapointed.  However, make sure they get into relationships, so [[Rule 34|Rule 34]] is canon.

'''3: THE TERTIARY CAST'''

Feel free to repeat this step as many times as you can. Every time you do this your series' longevity is increased. These next set of characters can have TWO distinct features while conforming to stock character archetypes. The comparitive depth will allow for an even greater fanbase - now you are now bound to have a character for every teenager to fantasize over. Introduce these characters as villains, give each one an emotional death scene at the hands of the protagonist/ supporting cast and then, right when the fans are suckered in, resurrect them, reverse their motivations and have them join the supporting cast. From this point on do not advance them in anything but the most predictable way.
[[Image:Ichigoatse.jpg|thumb|left|Fucking deep.]]

'''4: THE OMG SURPRISE TWIST'''

Now anyone of intellectual deficiency has at least one character they can pretend to be and the vast majority will have two or three. Now it's time to develop the protagonist in a way that will give the core fans, the dolts who were suckered in from the beginning, a screaming orgasm. Note that some will be alienated, but now you have around 50 shitty characters for them to re-align with so it doesn't matter. The 'twist' isn't actually a surprise at all, just give your character an ability that revolves around the following: [[gay|darkness]], [[gay|evil]], [[gay|spikes]], [[gay|death]], [[gay|the color red]], [[gay|the color black]]. Feel free to give your protagonist his first facial expression, the kids will fucking love it.

'''5: THE FUCKING MULLET'''

[[Image:gaymullet.png|thumb|right|Get 'er done.]]

No joke, Bleach's shitbag of an author actually has a secret obsession to get nailed in the ass by a drunken redneck in the deep south. Specifically, by Larry the Cable Guy and Robert E. Lee at the same time. Bleach has developed a habit of making the strongest fucking characters have '''fucking mullets'''... obviously not trolling, but just for the lulz. Next thing you'll see, they'll be driving a pick-up truck with Ichigo having a wincest-pedo-threesome with his two kid sisters. Fucking great.

Congratulations, you anti-intellectual cunt, you have lowered the artistic expectations of an entire generation and have a house made out of paper-mache'd cash.

Feel free to read the rest of this article if you havn't got the gist of this yet, but I wouldn't bother if I were you.  The only badass thing that happens is that Ichigo dies!

...Yeah it isn't that too interesting either, seeing how he godmods.

==The Plot==

[[Image:Detergent1.png|thumb|right|The only good book in the series]]
...Well, there really isn't one. Rather, the "story" of Bleach is just an endless stream of fights with no point, strung together, with the enemies getting gayer looking with each successive fight to trick you into thinking the story is going somewhere. It's worth noting that less than half of the battles even feature Ichigo or his [[Insane Clown Posse|band of queers]]. The rest are just about stereotypical-looking retards who [[shit nobody cares about|no one gives a shit about]] and who have names that are too fucking long.

The battles themselves are much like the ones in [[Dragonball Z]] except a thousand times lamer. Some random character will be running along and some other random dumbass will appear in their path for no reason. It'll then cut to a flashback showing the two of them when they were friends 9,000 years ago. Back in the present, they'll spend about twenty minutes talking on and on and on about how they're gonna kick some of [[dat ass]] before sending their swords into god mode, which transforms said swords into mile-long turds or something. For the next 7 episodes they'll [[Dungeons & Dragons|wave their swords around]] before one of them will reveal that they're [[only 2 percent|ONLY USING TWO PERCENT OF THEIR POWER!!!!!!11!!%]]. The other will scream at them to stop holding back and they'll continue fighting for 20 more episodes before one of them will sustain a cut to the shoulder and [[fail|die]], only to be shown being revived in the next episode. Somehow, despite being [[Death_Note|death gods]] who wield [[penis|magic swords]] that turn into demons or some other fucking retarded thing, nobody ever manages to get hit anywhere other than the shoulder. 
===The First of [[over 9000|Many, Many Arcs]]===
Ichigo Kurosaki is a [[13 year old boy|15 year old boy]] who can see dead people. Meanwhile, Rukia the Soul Reaper has been dead for [[at least 100|150 years]]. The two meet when [[you gonna be raped|Ichigo is about to get raped by a Hollow]], and Rukia tries to give him some of her powers. But as she is the rare Asian that can't do math, she [[divide by 0|divided by zero]] and [[I_accidentally_X|Ichigo accidentally all Rukia's Soul Reaper powers]] and goes all Super Saiyan on the viewing audience. Some believe the size of his hueg sword means he's [[cock|over-compensating for something.]] [[Penis|One can only wonder what.]]

The show sets up pretty early that Ichigo craves the cock, because he not only has Rukia sleeping in his closet every night and Orihime the walking chestcicle willing to suck his tiny azn dick (that's right even though he has orange hair he's azn), and not once does he try tapping any of [[dat ass]].

[[Image:Even when you drop the soap...no, especially when you drop it.jpg|thumb|right|"[[surprise buttsex|BFF]]'s Forever GAIz!1!" -[[pretty cool guy|Chad]]. ]]

===[[emo|Soul Society Arc]]===
Soul Society decides to [[get banned faggot|ban Rukia]] [[dying alone|from IRL forever]] for her shameful math skillz. Ichigo, always in search of a good fight like [[Animu_Archetypes|your typical shounen hero]] rushes off to save her, along with all his other BFF. From this point forwards, you'll need a score to keep track of the many characters that join the cast that includes [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/2/2a/Bleach-kenpachi.jpg batshit captains], flaming fairies that make [[Chris Crocker]] look butch and the only known example of [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/2/22/KomamuraSajin.png anonymous turning furry].

Rukia, who was the stereotypical batshit fighting chick whenever a guy peeks at her panties  become a complete and total emo. We eventually learn she feels [[troll's remorse]] for killing her <strike>[[dead friend|BFF]]</strike> married lover after he became an Hollow and she was [[almost raped]]. BAWWWWWWWWW, [[sob story|how sad for her]]. [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/c/cb/Rufflecar_gets_a_blowjob.jpg This] is about the only thing worth remembering from that.

Eventually, we discover no one gave a shit about Ichigo or Rukia, but that this was all an elaborate ruse for <s>[[God|Aizen's]] </s>Superman's evil deed to use [[ZA WARUDO]]. Instead of getting an epic battle...Ichigo goes home after Rukia is saved. Lame.

[[Image:Some_picture.jpg|thumb|left|A major element of the story. ]]
===Bount Arc===
...was lame ass filler that [[no one gives a shit|no one gave a shit]] about. Not even the [[fag|fans]]. Shocking, [[amirite]]?

...It's probably the best arc though, 'cause Kubo didn't write it.

===[[Mexico|Hueco Mundo]]===
Aizen is almost ready to unleash [[ZA WARUDO]], but needs Orihime's [[Sailor Moon|powers of the moon]] to do it. He creates a bunch of Hollow/Shinigami [[Mpreg|assbabies]] called Arrancar/Espada  who live in a giant [[muslims|mosque]] named [[Taco Bell|Las Noches]] because the author needs to up the battle count for this show. And because more characters = [[????|more story]] = [[Profit|more money]]. And instead of having to sit through Ichigo and company's fights, you'll get to see every captain, leuitenant and his uncle battle, too. Or rather talk for the first twenty minutes of every episode (without commericals, the show is twenty-three minutes long. Think about it)(and be horrified. UTTERLY).

[[Bitch|Orihime]] becomes even moar useless throughout this arc, the only words she's able to say coherently being "[[ALL_CAPS|KUROSAK-KUN! KUROSAKI-KUN! KUROSAK-KUN! KUROSAKI-KUN!KUROSAK-KUN! KUROSAKI-KUN!]]" over and over again. Even the biggest fans want to stick a gag to get her to [[STFU]].

The only memorable character from this arc is [[Mike Tyson|CHARLOTTE COOLHORN]], a sparkly twink tranny that will give you nightmares upon looking at his face.  Awkwardly enough, he was the only funny character.

After that arc Kubo also killed off the [[retarded|"deep"]] blind black guy, by having him turn into a [[penis]] and then a cricket before griefing the [[furry]] captain and getting cut in half. Kubo also made the only other black person in the anime have the ability to [[what|turn into a pumpkin.]]

Oh yeah, the only useful thing that happened in this arc was that someone had the balls to ''acutally kill Ichigo''.  That same character apperently ate someone's hand off screen, kidnapped Orihime, and was badass all together UNTIL HE HAD TO DIE AN EMO DEATH.

Jesus crist, Japan.

== The Next Arcs ==
Since we just finished a hugeass arc, we gonna give something else to shove down our fan's throats!
And guess what that means?

[[What|WE'RE GONNA HAVE TWO MORE ARCS OF THIS SHIT, AND NO ONE'S GIVING A DAMN!

Yes sir, we're gonna have everything a ''regular'' manga has, but WITH FUCKING PSYCHICS, ICHIGO GETTING HIS POWERS BACK, AND MORE SHIT YOU'LL EVER NEED.

And guess what again?  The characters got new looks!  And by new looks, I mean HAIRSTYLES.  We even got rid of Orihime's hair thingies because she got emotionally scarred dispite the fact she said she would never take them off!  Uyru looks twice as gay, and Ichigo doesn't look even the slightest bit difference!  We also have a new lolicon, too!

As well, while we're doing that, we're gonna show how the villains from the previous arc are doing in hell]]!

[[No|Is this gonna be fucking awesome!?]]

== Characters ==
[[Image:Bleach_plot_lines.JPG|thumb|right|Behind of scenes of writing [[fail|Bleach]]]]

Too many to list. Most [[animu|Annie Mays]] are infamous for having at least 100 characters with various degrees of emo background. Bleach takes that concept and ramps it up to eleven, as the most recent opening (complete with fanservice and [[Utada Hikaru|bad J-Pop music]]) shows. 

Suffice it to say that many of the main characters (including [[faggot|Ichigo]]) get shuffled to the side in place of many tertiary characters and about [[Over 9000|ten million]] or so other villains that have popped up through the series and comic relief characters [[shit no one cares about|EVERYONE CARES ABOUT]].

== [[shit no one cares about|Other Important Details]] ==
[[Image:Bankai.gif|thumb|left|Bankai is also code for fucking your sister.]]
*Bankai: the Bleach equivalent of [[Over 9000|Super Saiyan]]. This is the [[final solution]] to end all battles and 'pwn' your opponents, whenever anyone on this show [[STFU|shuts up]] long enough to actually fight. One notable bankai is that of Rukia's gay fairy brother Byakuya. Again, it shoots PETALS. [[pansy|Pink fucking petals]]. 

*[[Rape_spider|Hollows]]: Big ass monsters out to kill everyone and rape them with their tentacles, in that order. They will tell their victims "[[Usagi Kou|I EET YOU!!!]]" 
[[Image:Harbl copy.jpg|thumb|right|An arrancar's release, or [[weeaboo|"resurrección"]]]] moar liek resurerection.
	
*[[Birdman|Arrancar]]: Hollow/Soul Reaper assbabies. All the women have gigantic breasts that make Orihime look as flat as Rukia in comparision and the men are either flaming [[Fag|gay]] or old bastards. 

*No one dies on this show: Seriously. Unless you are a bad guy or Ichigo's mom, you'll be beaten to an inch of your life and be AWWRIGHT by the next episode.

* Only one guy had the balls to fuck everything up.  Of course, he was an emo, so it didn't count.

{{quote|ATTENTION ICHIRUKI FANS!!!!! (If you aren't in ''Bleach'' or aren't IchiRuki, you can ignore this.)

Take all_for_bleach and kurosaki_clinic off your friends lists and unjoin them! They are enemies of IchiRuki and free speech, and they hate you and your pairing!

Don't let yourselves be second-class citizens of fandom anymore! STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS!|[http://community.livejournal.com/fanficrants/tag/%231+ichiruki+shipper ichirukiavenger]}}

Like any big fandom, there are plenty of [[batshit]] [[ship]]pers ready to defend their pairing's honor at a moment's notice. The biggest rivarly (LOLWUT) is that between Ichigo/Rukia and Ichigo/Orihime fans; however, both camps fail to realize that Ichigo is more interested in [[D&D|playing swords]] than he is in porking his sword into either one of them.

==Wank Triggers==

* Asking if sex with Komamura counts as bestiality.
* Asking what happens if a soul reaper/shinigami(already dead)dies.
* Asking how the souls age.
* Asking how many times [[Emo|Ulquiorra]] cuts himself a day.
* Asking why every character ends up growing a mullet at some point. 
* Informing fans that Ichigo is a [[nazi]] since he carries a [http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Taezh4ULlfw/SQSm5Wcd4TI/AAAAAAAAAXA/rLFSdj9uNzg/s400/Wooden-Tensa+Zangetsu.jpg| sword] with a [[卐| swastika]] on it.
* Inform fans that deny Ichigo is a Nazi by pointing out that [[tit|Tite]] [[fucker|Kubo]] loves using [[mexican|Spanish]] in bleach. [[shit_nobody_cares_about|Where did alot of Nazis run off to after WWII?]] [[Africa|South America]]. What is the primary language in South America? Spanish. The [[bullshit|parallels]] go on and on.
* Informing fans that Ichigo nailing Rukia is in fact necrophilia.
* Informing fans that it doesn't matter if Ichigo dies, because he will just come back as a soul reaper.
* Informing fans that the [[Mexicans|Arrancar]] are not Japanese in anyway.
* Informing fans that Ichigo turning Hollow is not a declaration of love for Orihime.
* Informing fans that [[fag|Tousen]] is actually Ray Charles.
* Informing fans that [[Tony Stark]] and [[Tony Stark|Coyote Starrk]] are secretly the same person between different shots of [[Alchohol|Tequila]].
* [[white knighting|Saying anything bad about]] debbiechan and her comm bleachness (the Bleach Anon meme has many examples of this)
* Arguing over whether secks with Yachiru counts as [[cp|baby fucking]] (and if it's indeed AWWWRIGHT!)
* Saying [[Naruto]] or [[One Piece]] is better than Bleach.

You can't make this whackaloon bullshit up!)

== The Gay Factor ==

If any anime can give [[Naruto]] a run for it's money in the [[faggotry]] department, it's this show. You often don't have to shoop pictures to show how most of the characters would rather suck off cocks than eat pussy (except [[dyke|Chizuru]]).

== Ratings ==

# Action: 0 for ripping off ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', and the fact that Ichigo has no fucking clue when to [[STFU]] and fight already. He and every other character on the show will [[but what are your thoughts on yaoi?|go on and on and on and on about shit no one asked about]] instead of [[Cowboy Bebop|just kicking ass and being done with it]].
# Lulz: 0 Due to ultra-gayness.
# Furry Level: 10/10 for former Anon Komamura and Grimmjaw turning furry.
# Gay Level: [[OVER 9000]]! [[At least 100]] of those points are due to Renji's sexual confusion, but other factors include but are not limited to: Shuuhei's gay 69 tattoo, Ichigo's large sword covering up for his small [[Azn]] [[penis]], Chizuru the [[dyke]], Byakuya's sword producing [[pansy|FUCKING PANSIES]] for bankai, everyone having an emo past, and Ichigo having Rukia living in his closet and not once does his think about tapping that [[ass]]. AND [[Tranny|CHARLOTTE COOLHORN]]. Not even Matsumoto and Orihime's giant tits can counteract the [[epic]] levels of [[gay]] in this show.
# Merchandising: ONE MILLION. The show has about [[42]] [[shit]]ty opening and ending songs and each character has over 9,000 images songs (9,000 times 9,000...you do the math).They all sound pretty much like every other [[Japanese-y]] J-Pop song ever, not to mention three movies that continue where the filler arcs leave off to assrape the manga even [[moar]].
