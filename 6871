'''RealJoke''', often abbreviated '''RJ''', is a website for [[lie|gay jocks]], fitness buffs, and [[gay]] men looking to have a more [[sex|active]] [[HIV|lifestyle]]. Though the site obviously claims to be for gay men interested in fitness, they allow anyone and everyone on, so the site has become a giant clusterfuck of lisps, STDs, and collective stroking of each others' [[victim complex]]es. The forums are constantly full of four things: infighting, [[fags]] bitching that the masculine gay guys out there don't like them, fags whining about [[Christianity]], and fags talking about [[Britney Spears]] since that's the only thing they think about, well, other than [[bug chasers|how to get STDs]]. Any sign of [[troll]]ing is immediately pounced upon by the members, with their [[faggotry|fierce]] [[e-peen|e-claws]] and the slow [[banhammer]] of the site admin. Needless to say, anything and everything posted on the site is like a match being dropped in a dry forest that's been sprayed with gasoline.

==Different Personalities on the Site==

[[Image:Exhibita.jpg|thumb|Exhibit A. Should [[gb2]] [[ModelMayhem]].]]
[[Image:Exhibite.jpg|thumb|left|Exhibit E, young and too [[pussy]] to come out.]]
[[Image:Exhibitf.jpg|thumb|left|Exhibit F, commonly seen in the forums. It's so flaming, someone get me a fire hose!]]

RealCock is supposedly [[lie|classier]] than gay hookup sites like [[Craigslist]], [[Manhunt]] (yes, the video game), and [[ModelMayhem]]. However, this is clearly not the case. The site, for one, allows users to upload [[n00dz]], unlike some other [[gay]] sites, and actively promotes being a [[camwhore]] through their free adult [[cyber sex|webcam chat]]. The following examples should provide some insight into the depths of depravity that can be witnessed on RJ. Sometimes it's better to stare into the abyss of [[goatse]] than to look at what's on RJ. And I wish I were kidding when I said that. Even [[BigMuscle]] doesn't get this gay.

===Exhibit A.===

The muscular gay guy. More than a bit of a paradoxical, oxymoronic conundrum, this fag's life revolves around going to the gym, working out for 20 minutes, then spending 2 hours cruising the gym sauna and showers for [[anonymous]] [[buttsecks]]. Exhibitionists at heart, these are the guys who will never upload an image of themselves wearing a shirt, however, they rarely upload [[n00dz]] because they [[lie|don't want anyone they know in person to see]] (though they're all in porn... srs.) Exhibit A can also often be seen on [[BigMuscle]]. While exhibit A's mission in life is to prove to the world he has more to offer than a hot body, he's normally too busy having sex or working out to make anything else of himself.
[[IRL]], exhibit A tends to only associate with others like itself. They hook up with each other all the time but consider themselves too good/hot for [[Craigslist]]. Exhibits A and H are often one and the same.

===Exhibit B.===

The average-bodied gay guy who's only on RJ to look at pictures of Exhibit A. Often, these guys don't upload pictures to hide their [[fugly]], however, one will occasionally get a case of [[USI]] and venture into the forums thinking they'll soon be the most attractive guy on RJ though they only work out once a year. Normally, these people lose interest and keep [[lurk]]ing long after their departure from the forum catfights. Exhibit B is also often resentful toward Exhibit A for being so much better at life, and thus many specimens of Exhibit B try to harass Exhibit A in the forums. Exhibit A, however, does not notice the mere 4's and continues its pushups while getting assfucked.

===Exhibit C.===

The bitter, resentful old man. Only athletic in his later years and unable to lose his beer gut, these old [[bear]]s populate the forums and constantly whine about how [[lie|harsh and oppressive things were when they were young]], and about how they weren't able to come out until now. They use this as an excuse to upload horrifying shirtless and nude photos, and feel slighted when people don't show them as much [[comment whore|e-love]] as the younger, more attractive members. Always liberal, these geriatrics will attack any viewpoint or politician they deem responsible for their time spent in the closet.

===Exhibit D.===

[[Image:Exhibitd.jpg|thumb|Exhibit D ventures into the forums! ...and gets no response.]]

The creepy old stalker. Unlike the bitter, resentful old man, the creepy old stalker will never participate in forums, nor upload any images of himself. However, he will "hot list" every member under 30 on the site and ask them to send him their n00dz. They are generally unlucky, and often get swiftly banned for their faggotry. Exhibit D can also get very clingy, and quickly becomes attached to those he has never communicated with. If a person does not respond to Exhibit D's message at all or quickly enough, Exhibit D will [[chimpout|flip shit]] and send [[hate mail]] to the object of his affection.

===Exhibit E.===

The young closet case. Specimens of Exhibit E will "hot list" a large number of people and message them asking to talk. While normally an inconspicuous, straight-acting [[desperate]] guy, sometimes these are really examples of Exhibit D in disguise, trying to con younger, more attractive members into sending them their n00dz. Legitimate examples of Exhibit E will often post in forums looking for advice, and will be shunned by Exhibit F when they say "I don't want to be a part of the gay scene." In the forums, exhibits A, E, and H (generally interchangeable) frequently get into flame wars against exhibits B, C, F, and G while Exhibit D sits on the sidelines watching.

===Exhibit F.===

[[Image:Exhibitg1.jpg|thumb|Exhibit G: You don't have to be a jock to be on RealJock, EVERYONE's invited! Even the friendly neighborhood [[transvestite]].]]

The butthurt flaming fag. See [[Gaygod]], [[Brandon Hilton]], etc. These fags flood the forums with their fairy dust, often going [[ad hominem]] at moderates, conservatives, and anyone who disagrees. They all believe that if every gay person on the planet were to hold hands and be BFFs, there would be sparkles and rainbows in the sky. Not even kidding. They're not on crack, they're just batshit liberal. Exhibit F is quick to criticize anyone who does not think as it does, particularly Exhibits E and H. The hostility with which these queens treat closeted Exhibit E has likely made more than one person decide to [[dying alone|stay in the closet forever]] just to avoid the lisping.

===Exhibit G.===
[[Image:ExhibitH2.jpg|thumb|Exhibit H: I'M SO [[Not gay|NOT GAY]] U GUISE]]

[[Image:Exhibitg2.jpg|thumb|Typical "adult photos" on RJ.]]

There are no words. Look to the right.

===Exhibit H.===

The straight-wannabe. This homo is somewhat of a rare specimen. Typically raised in a conservative home and staunchly subscribing to [[Glenn Beck|conservative values]] that disapprove of faggotry, this fag must reconcile his faggotry with his political beliefs by lashing out against others in the gay community in various venues including RealJock and ED. By being critical of them, he feels absolved of the rejection placed on him by his very own conservatism, as he convinces himself that the rejection only applies to those 'other' gays and not himself. He will readily apply the gay stereotype to all other gays but himself and possibly his friends, even more so than straight homophobes do. Often times he will adopt the g0y ideology, under which a group of gay men refuse to participate in anal sex in hopes that this will be enough to convince his conservative community that he is not the [[hell]]spawn that other gays are. His only purpose on RealJock is to use it as an audience to profess to other faggots just how different and unlike them he is. Although he knows he cannot convince them of this, due to the fact that he still obviously craves penis, deep down inside he hopes to convince himself. 

Exhibit H is often unable take criticism like a man, while hypocritically loving to criticize others. This possibly makes him the faggiest of all the exhibits,  [[some argue|some experts perhaps argue]].

===Exhibit I.===

The politico. Only on RJ to argue politics, this clusterfuck of ten or so people go back and forth nonstop in threads about [[Palestine]] posted all over the website - yes, even in the dating forum, these folks are arguing about whether or not [[Muslim]]s should be allowed to take land from the mighty Jew. Most instances of Exhibit I are around a 4/10, middle-aged, and in relationships, hence their boredom with [[cyber sex|every other part of the site]]. While there are more liberal specimens of Exhibit I than conservative, often times conservative members of other Exhibits jump to the conservatives' aid, then regret their posting when they realize expressing their view cost them Man of the Day votes.

==The Webcam Chat Rooms==

[[Image:RJ Chat Screencap.jpg|thumb|The webcam chat rules are leniently enforced, to say the least.]]

RealJock has two webcam chat rooms, one that is SFW (which no one ever goes into) and and that is [[NSFW]], which often has [[at least 100]] people in it. The latter chat room will be further elaborated in this section since [[no one]] gives a shit about anything SFW.

The adult chat room is frequented by exhibit A when seeking attention and approval, exhibit B to watch exhibit A, exhibit C to masturbate on cam, exhibit D to masturbate on cam (or be creepy and lurk), exhibit E to masturbate (but rarely on cam), exhibit F to dance around in its underwear to [[Lady GaGa]], [[Katy Perry]], and Ke$ha, and exhibit G for... I don't even want to think about it. Exhibit H is often found staring at the 'adult chat' link but unable to click it, caught in an internal struggle between his primal urges to sit on penis and his anti-gay values.  The NSFW chat room says that only one person is allowed per camera, i.e., no live buttsecks, however, the rules are leniently enforced, to say the least since even the admin likely [[fap]]s to the webcam chat.

Anyone who has a substantially-sized "buddy list" on RJ or is on many hot lists has likely taken it off in the webcam chat. Scratch that, pretty much every member has gotten naked in the webcam chat, however, only the attractive ones or those who are on it 24/7 get hot listed.

==The Forums==

If you thought you'd seen easily butthurt people, think again. The people on RJ get more butthurt than a crowd of [[black chicks]] when you smash a [[watermelonz|watermelon]] on the ground. Anything and everything is seen as [[offended|offensive]] by the hyper-vigilant, hyper-[[political correctness|PC]] forum dwellers, many of whom spend hours a day on RJ, amassing [[over 9000]] posts whining about all sorts of [[bullshit]]. Since everyone on the forums has a [[victim complex]] nearly the size of their ego, one can imagine how easy it is for one offended fairy to turn into a fluttering, screeching swarm. Beware!

Common topics which send forumgoers into a [[rage]]:

-[[Religion]] (specifically, [[Christianity]] and the states of [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]])

-[[Conservatives]], because you CAN'T be gay and conservative. Nope. Not at all. Isn't that right, [[Larry Craig]]?

-Guys who say they don't respect feminine guys or the gay scene

-Guys who insult someone's "gender identity" or say something along the lines of "if you have a dick, you ain't a chick."

However, despite their hatred of masculinity (likely from hatred of their tiny [[cock]]s), they try to go along with threads about stereotypically [[gay|macho]] things such as not shaving and MMA fighting. However, they only do this because they think it'll make them look more masculine (and thus hot listable) in the eyes of their fellow fairies.

Posting any sort of [[music]] in the threads, specifically [[Olga Roll|annoying]] [[Corinna Fugate|ass]] [[SUPERCOOLWILLOW|shit]] always manages to piss someone off. If you want to troll, post shitty music and say you're a Republican. The entire site will be up in arms against you... after they're done crying that a fellow gay man doesn't understand and accept them as the beautiful and unique little flowers they all are.

===A typical RJ forum post===

[[Image:Screenshot2010-10-27at33332AM.png|thumb|I bet his ass lost a gallon of blood.]]

<div id="rjpost" style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black;">

Actually I was once approached by a guy to use the sauna with him when I was 18, and then he invited me into the gang shower. Kinda funny how it happened, my first sorta-gay experience.

For physical therapy following a motorcycle accident, my doctor had arranged for me to do swimming at a nearby college pool. I wasn't a student there, but he was one of their sports team physicians, and got permission for me.

So I phoned them and picked a time that was good for me. I showed up, showered, put on my swimsuit, and as soon as I walked out onto the pool deck I heard voices yelling at me to take my suit off! I froze in place, confused and unable to see who was shouting at me, because my eyeglasses were back in a locker. Everyone was in the water, and the lifeguard seemed to be wearing a red suit on his platform, so I didn't know what was going on, and I fled back inside.

Moments later a dripping wet, totally naked college student was at my locker, explaining that this was the men's swim time and was conducted in the nude. Well, I'd done that as a kid at the Y years earlier, and at summer camp, and therefore could believe it still went on in 1967. But since maturing I'd developed a problem with going stiff when around other naked guys, like in the HS showers. So nude swimming was no longer for me.

But this guy was insistent I return, plus I knew my doctor would get mad, and tell my parents if I didn't follow his advice. Not sure I could make another open swim time work for me, I decided to risk it. I reentered with a towel held as nonchalantly as I could in front of my junk, dropped it onto a bench at the last possible second, and almost ran to the pool as I felt myself plumping.

I swam furious laps trying to lose it, finally hanging from the scupper exhausted. That student I'd met earlier swam up next to me, then suddenly bobbed under water, surfaced in a flash and casually told me it was OK, I'd lost my boner. I was speechless.

He explained he'd seen me getting hard on the pool deck, and saw it underwater, but not to worry too much, it happens to lots of guys, especially until they get used to nude swimming. I didn't like this kind of intimate discussion, especially since I felt myself boning up again, so off I went for more laps.

I quit when I became chilled, and went to get dressed. But my "buddy" appeared naked at my locker once again, and said I looked cold. I admitted I was, and he suggested using the sauna, what he always did after a swim. I said I wasn't familiar with it, so he offered to show me the routine and took me there. I felt a little more comfortable now with a towel wrap.

But once inside on a wooden bench he advised me to unwrap my towel and spread it out to get the best benefits of the heat, as he did. Here we go again, I thought, and sure enough, there "it" went again, too, right in front of him.

But far from being scandalized about it, as I was, he talked about it quite casually, which only made it grow bigger. This is where my memory fades a bit, I think because my mind was racing so fast, as well as my heart, as SILVERFOX described. I recall him telling me to relax, it was nothing to be ashamed of, just a result of tension due to my shyness, and he kept telling me how nice my dick looked, I should be proud of its size. And I was parallyzed by fear, confusion, and an overpowering feeling of wicked desire, that I liked what was happening.

At some point his hand was on my thigh, and eventually gently caressing my dick and cupping my balls. Just as he began a more sincere stroking we heard footsteps approaching, and quickly threw our towels across our laps, since he was now fully erect, too.

As the other guy settled in (and, I noted to myself, kept his towel wrapped around himself) my companion announced he'd had enough heat, and was heading to the showers. I lingered for another minute so as not to be seen following him. When I did step outside he was waiting just a few feet away, and quickly herded me in a direction away from the showers I had already used. He knew about some semi-private team showers, that he said would be safer to use at this hour.

It was there under the spray that he concluded what he had started, adding his mouth to my education. But he finished me with his fist, and my knees literally buckled, that he had to support me in his arms.

I then tried to masturbate him but wasn't too good at it, yet neither did I think I could suck him, a little too much for me at this point. So he told me he'd like it better if I kept my hands soaped up and slid them more (he was cut), and he finally shot, my first.

I'm not sure how much that qualified as gay sex, and I never saw him again, nor did I have any gay sex with another man for 28 more years after that.
