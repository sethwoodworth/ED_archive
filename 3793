Hugh Jackman Can Ride Anything
{{Meme}}{{Forced Meme}}

'''Hugh Jackman Can Ride Anything''' is a forced meme created by the [[ausfag|Ausfailian]] media last week. The picture was taken when the Ruler of Australia, [[Wolverine|Hugh Jackman]] went down the world's biggest flying fox to get to the stage where the Oprah show was filming. Instead of paying attention to what he was doing, he waved to all the worshipers of [[Oprah]] which then caused him to forget to put the brakes on and hit a light stand, proving that Australians are [[retarded]].
