[[Image:Epic red ranger maneuver.gif|thumb|right|The Epic Maneuver in the form of an animated gif]]
Between the days of Captain Planet and [[Webcomics]] the world hovered in search for a piece of popular culture that could be exploited and forever be laughed at for being teh [[ghey]]. Search ended upon acknowledging the politically correct, edu-taining superheros POWER RANGERS! What the world didn't realize is that they were not prepared for the truly [[epic]] and moving nature of said program.

Red Ranger's Epic Maneuver is the prime example of the [[Power Rangers]] amazing and dramatic feats executed in order to fight [[for great justice]]. A scene of such epic proportions was first discovered on [[4chan]], but soon spread and spawned across the depths that is [[YTMND]] with one of the five backing music tracks that every [[underageb&|13 year old faggot]] on [[YTMND]] uses for every video.

Once popularity spread, variations of the Epic Maneuver have been found, as well as similar [[lulzy|heartwarming]] documentations of similar feats of justice and bravery.
