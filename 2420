[[Image:Sean_Piche.jpg|thumb|380px|right|NEW JERSEY (AP) — Engineers with Halliburton Corp. (NYSE: EVIL) have announced the formation of an exploratory well on the forehead of Sean Piche. One engineer was quoted as saying that a conservative estimate of the well's potential could be up to 100 million barrels of light fat-fuck crude. If this turns out to be the case, it could power the Internet for a couple of hours.]]

'''Dragoneer''' (a.k.a. '''The Dragoneer''', '''[[Fag]]oneer''', '''Preyfar''', '''Inkjammer''',  '''[[powerword|Sean Piche]]''', or lately '''Princess Piche'''), born March 25, 1983, residing at 12004 Starboard Dr #302, Reston, VA 20194[http://whois.domaintools.com/70.33.186.196][http://twitter.com/Dragoneer/status/12135853908299776], is the owner of [[Furaffinity|FurAffinity.net]]. He suffers from a severe case of [[unwarranted self importance]] and is a closet [[Babyfur]]. He is also [[Anti-lulz|very funny]] and will [[ban]] you if you don't agree.

Currently Dragoneer resides in [[yuppies|Northern Virginia]] in the Washington, D.C. area with other [[furries]].

==Personal Life==

Dragoneer is one of [[whore|those people]] that always somehow manages to have the latest fancy gadget to hit the market. He owns a [http://twitpic.com/2d4d06 Alienware desktop computer, a HDTV, a fursuit], [http://twitpic.com/cs6ef at least one] [http://twitpic.com/2gcekq custom built computer], a [http://twitpic.com/2fwrox Droid cell phone], iPhones that he can make into [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/3973132/ iPhone sandwiches] and probably much, much more. Don't forget he's [[always]] commissioning some [[Offended|great new pieces of art]] of his character!

He's also an [[alcoholic]] and likes to [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/8/83/Sean_Piche_And_Alcohool.png talk about his experience with other furries about being drunk], which happens often because he is [[Dying alone|alone]]. He was warned several times at [[Anthrocon]] 2010 for inviting a couple of [[jailbait|17/18 year old furries]] ([http://www.furaffinity.net/user/xanthosking xanthosking] and [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/zharr18 zharr18]) to have a drink [[rape|in his hotel room]], which is illegal. But, they were [[canada|Canadians]], where the legal drinking age is 18. So it's awwright!

[[Image:Dragoneerfourloko.jpeg|thumb|Getting drunk on Four Loko and liveblogging about it is one of Dragoneer's favorite hobbies]]
[[Image:Sean Piche Resume From LinkedIn.png|thumb|Sean Piche's resume from LinkedIn. All the periods of unemployment show how successful he '''really''' is at his career.]]
[[Image:I Believe In Sean Piche.jpg|thumb|Quick, Chase! To the Fatcave!]]

Dragoneer is also a supporter of ''Making The Fandom Look Good™''. He was quick to proclaim a FA user named Dogbomb [[An hero|a hero]] after Dogbomb [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/4296204 sat in fursuit with a kid] suffering from Cerebral Palsy, saying how it improved the fandom's image while at the same time he himself was drawing and commissioning furry porn. Oh, did we mention how he also runs the largest furry porn repository in the world? Clearly Sean does not think his own actions are contributing to the [[Yiff|problem]].

His most notable technique to gain popularity is also known as playing the [[Pretty cool guy|cool guy]] (actually a [[memefag|INSATIABLE MEMEFAG]]), which is posting a link to the most popular [[YouTube]] video of the moment, filling his posts and tweets with [[memes]] (not even knowing what they mean), countless attempts at [[chanspeak]], and countless references to [[TF2]], [[Portal]] and [[/b/]]. This is especially true when he posts updates using FA's mascot account [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/fender/ Fender], which usually consist of pure [[Anti-lulz]] (take [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1569773/ this] for example). Dragoneer will always claim he's open-minded about the Internet culture, but if you tell him you're a [[4chan|4channer]], a [[goon]], and/or post on [[ED]] (or simply have references to those on your profile), you most likely get his banhammer cause anonymous is always conspiring against him or some shit. Because being [[cool]] is a privilege reserved to Dragoneer and his crew.

Dragoneer is also a fan of [[Babyfur|cub art]] and at one point his character and the character of his then-[[Gay|boyfriend]] appeared on the back cover of [[Softpaw Magazine]] as [[Pedobear|children in tight underwear]] and also in a unfinished comic (Available in the gallery below).

===Sean Piche & The furry drama scene===

Perhaps one of the most hypocritical and irritating things about Dragoneer is that he openly participates in the mecca of [[unfunny|wit]] and [[circlejerk|one-upsmanship]] that is the furry drama scene. You can rest assured if you have a thread discussing Dragoneer, FurAffinity, or one of his obsessions he will show up and probably make a fool of himself. It is then up to [[you]] (or the [[mod]]s) to mercy ban him, or milk this low-wattage intellect for the [[lulz]]. He remains obsessed years later with the Philadelphia furry crowd as well as the [[Anthrocon]] crew, because when he lived there almost every last one of them found him too stupid, loud, and annoying to be around. The people who deal with [[Uncle Kage]] year after year basically told him he talked too much, please don't ever be on staff again, kthx. As a result they started avoiding him, something that even he was able to notice, as can be evidenced in [http://lists.claws-and-paws.com/pipermail/pa-furry/2003-November/005695.html this poor attempt] at subtle sarcasm on the PA furry mailing list. He moved out of that area in the early 2000s but harbors a grudge against them to this day, which is evidenced in the [http://forums.vivisector.org/index.php/topic,113.0.html ongoing feud] between [[Uncle Kage]]'s Macrophile Denial-fest and Sean's vanity con he purchased with that sweet, sweet gummint-contractor money.

It is all well and good if Sean or one of his many furry fanboys badmouth Kage or spread unverifiable innuendo, but if you do the same about FA and/or Dragoneer himself Sean will revert to making bad jokes and pretending to take it all with good humor (and not being very convincing) until he thinks he can vent with some privacy, at which point you have earned yourself an enemy for life.

===Sciggles===
[[File:Sciggles_neerhead.jpg|right|thumb|Sciggles poses next to a decapitated Dragoneer.]]]'''[[File:Sciggles_Is_A_Dominatrix.png|right|thumb|Look at Dragoneer. Not only being dominated, but also beeing a BITCH-ASS ANAL VORING FURFAG!! And why isn't she makin' him a sammich?]]]'''[http://www.furaffinity.net/user/Sciggles Sciggles]''' (a.k.a. '''[http://www.facebook.com/Sciggles Susan Scoggins]''') is Dragoneer's [[bisexual|girlfriend]] (as of this writing, Furry relationships are known to end [[drama|abruptly]].) She is 21 years old, 10 years younger than Dragoneer (and for a while too young to consume his favorite [[alcohol|alcoholic drinks]], [http://twitter.com/Dragoneer/statuses/14184260961312768 but that didn't stop him].), backing up beliefs that he [[Pedo|likes 'em young]]. Sciggles is Dragoneer's <s>biggest</s> only fan and even [[Obsession|made a Dragoneer hat and plushie]] and wore them to [[Anthrocon|Anthrocon 2010]]. Did we mention [[Slut|she was with another guy at the time]]?

It is rumored Sciggles is doing it [[for the lulz]], ultimately with the goal of marrying Dragoneer before filing for [[divorce]] and taking half of his precious belongings or waiting for the inevitable [[heart attack]] from consuming so many [[energy drinks]] and reaping the reward: the world's largest furporn collection. If she's not, well, we feel sorry for the kids that will one day inevitably stumble upon Dragoneer's anal vore porn collection (you think that's [[srsly|a joke]], don't you?) Besides, everyone knows that Dragoneer will never have [[jailbait|kids]] because that means he'd have to stop buying [[over 9000]] [[iPhone]]s a month and buying, well, anal vore porn sketches from high-priced artists.

===A trailer park boy goes to the big city===

[[At least 100 years ago]], Dragoneer lived in [[Philadelphia]], and ended up being hated by all the furries there. To this day he hates Giza and [[Uncle Kage]] because of what happened there. [[Some argue|One side]] of the story is that he was a borderline-crazy dumbass who appeared to have genuine psychological problems and thus people began avoiding him. Of course, his paranoia about this didn't really help things either. Dragoneer, being still obsessed with events almost a decade old, recently revealed more when responding to the latest surfacing of the [[facts]] surrounding [[Jibba Foxcoon]] (namely, that [[2 gryphon]] is an [[asshole]], but I repeat myself):

{{tinyquote|Giza was angry at me because I called him out for cheating on Phil da Feline. Way back when, Giza and Phil da Feline were dating. Phil walked in on Giza sucking another guy's dick, they got into huge drama, fights ensued. A while later, they got back together... and at MFF, same shit happened together. One day Phil came over to my place, crying, claiming Giza tried to take advantage of him... and I went ballistic. I started openly called Giza out via my LiveJournal for cheating on Phil, lying and being a general douchebag. I wasn't very mature about it, but given what happened... I didn't really care. We had a huge drama war, and Giza eventually went to Kage to ask Kage to "fix" his problem. Namely, get rid of me So Kage did. Kage defended Giza (and blindly at that), refused to even hear my side of the story, and Kage kept saying if he wanted to cheat on Phil then that was Giza's right. And he defended that. I called shenanigans, but Kage had already made up his mind before he even spoke to me. Because I stood up to Kage, I got "promoted" from convention operations to "sales guy" for the artist's alley. So I left. Basically, they knew I'd do that... and I have no regrets about it. I wasn't thrown off AC (and I have several FA staffers who will back me up on this), but if they want to look at that way then I guess by demoting me they kinda did. In the end, Kage defended Giza's right to cheat on Phil, and I left Anthrocon and ended up going to Fur Affinity. Giza still takes pot-shots at me every once and a while. He does not seem to have the ability to let bygones be bygones. Some of my friends on Anthrocon's staff send me logs and shit when he goes berserk over it. I posted a journal two years later saying I wasn't going to Anthrocon, I was bailing on the con... and Kage took that as me outright attacking on AC. For... some reason. Thing was: I was at risk of losing my apartment due to financial problems at the time (animators didn't get paid a lot) and couldn't afford the con. I put life ahead of furry. The last thing Kage ever said to me was "Welcome to my shitlist, asshole." Why? Because in that same journal some people called Anthrocon "Kagecon" in my LiveJournal. And he detonated on me. This had nothing to do with Growly at all. Kage hasn't spoken to me since 2005. Even when we had stood in line next to each other for an hour to go to MFF in 2006, he wouldn't speak to me. Or even acknowledge I was there. It was cute.}}

===Dox===
In December 2010 Dragoneer got ''another'' new cellphone and proceeded to use [[Twitter]] on it, neglecting to turn off the [[Stalker|Geolocation feature]] causing him to dox himself. [[Lulz.net]] got ahold of [http://twitter.com/#!/Dragoneer/status/12257132208455680 this] [http://twitter.com/#!/Dragoneer/status/12135853908299776 information] and caused Dragoneer to bawwww about it on [[Livejournal]], claiming that people hate him just because he's an admin.

He lives [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=12004+Starboard+Dr+%23302,+Reston,+VA+20194&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=12004+Starboard+Dr,+Reston,+Fairfax,+Virginia+20194&gl=us&ei=67AATaH0L5CmnQe-sczlDQ&oi=geocode_result&ved=0CBYQ8gEwAA&t=h&z=16 here] and works [http://www.usis.com here].

==Progression in Allegory==

[[File:Dragoneer_is_Homer_Simpson.png|center|500px]]
<center>He doesn't die, he just slows down until he reaches absolute zero and [[fat|encompasses all the matter in the universe]]</center>

==Career==
[[Image:Sean Piche at Camp Chaos.jpg|thumb|Group photo taken at Camp Chaos in Reading, PA in early 2004. Sean Piche only survived there for 4 months before being kicked to the curb.]]

Dragoneer has has quite an [[boring|exciting]] career. He's [[failed|worked]] as an animator for VH1/Viacom and even worked in the [[Terrorist|middle east]]. This is proof that America spends so much money on its military that even someone like Dragoneer can get a piece of the action.

===As an animator===
Sean once worked for a couple of weeks in an animation department, where he composed the background of a few scenes for "ILL-ustrated", and did the text formatting for the credits page. His job was to be involved with a little cartoon on VH1, circa 2003. Sean didn't stay because he wanted to take the place of the character designer and become an animator, even though he had no artistic background or knowledge to perform this kind of task. His contract with VH1 was terminated prematurely. This remains to this day the best job he has ever had.

===Army career===
Sean Piche was sent in [[Kyrgyzstan]] under contract by the army as an IT technician. He may tell you he was sent to Manas Air Base to handle top secret data, but what he really did there was hooking up computers to ethernet cables and eventually reinstalling Windows XP on the base's Dell Optiplex machines. (Nothing that could land on WikiLeaks.) However, having "IT technician for the DOD" gave him some seizures of power, even if said computers were used like cybercafes: to allow soldiers to communicate with their families and look at porn. Fortunately, he was never given the opprotunity to ever deal with anything classified there, so America remains safe.  Again, he was sent back in the country circa 2008 for [[fat|medical reasons]], [[lazy|being unproductive]] (since he had to "manage" FurAffinity), and perhaps because he was too dumb to stay in service anyways.

===Current official job===
Currently Sean is employed by a government contractor in the [[IT]] field. No one is sure what his specific job is, because he [[CIA|encourages bullshit rumors to obscure more accurate rumors]]. However, fortunately for us [[User:KarryLing|some people]] watch his [[Twitter]], where he's [[retarded|not particularly guarded]] about all the [[TF2|stuff]] he does at work on the [[you|taxpayer's]] dime. It would seem that his job consists of him [http://twitpic.com/28xvb7 re-arranging his desk], [http://twitpic.com/1hkj54 playing video games], [http://twitter.com/Dragoneer/status/20130771963 chatting on YIM] and managing Blackberry service plans. Sometimes he has to do [http://twitter.com/Dragoneer/status/12599983586 actual work] and he whines about it. Your tax dollars at work!

Judging by his [[Furaffinity|track record]] at running servers, there's probably a reason he's not doing more at work. Would [[you]] let him work on servers, especially with potentially classified information on them? Yeah, neither would we.

[[Image:DragoneerIRL.jpg|thumb|[[piss|That isn't apple juice in the jug.]]]]

==Furaffinity==
[[Image:Sean Piche spends 150 dollars on a power cable.PNG|thumb|$150 on a power cable? FA's donations hard at work.]]
[[Image: Ferrox LLC.png|thumb|Pennsylvania Department of Revenue registration for Ferrox LLC.]]
Dragoneer is the [[lie|completely competent]] [[Blowjob|head]] [[Administrator]] of [http://www.furaffinity.net FurAffinity.net], a position in which he takes [[Ego|great pride in]]. He was given this position by Arcturus, the former owner, thinking Sean would be a useful idiot like everybody else. Eventually Dragoneer [[Drugs|rounded up enough cash]] to buy Arcturus out. He might be quick to tell you how [[Cock|hard]] his "job" is, but don't let him fool you! He is too [[lazy]] to do anything and has put together a [[fail|top-notch team]] to do the work he doesn't want to do. The only work Dragoneer does on FurAffinity is [[Ban|banning]] anyone who speaks out against him and dealing with (and starting) [[drama]].

Dragoneer also handles [[DMCA]] complaints and will ban you for sending one in before posting it on his [[Twitter]] and publicly mocking you because you asked him to do [[work]]. If this happens to [[you]], a [[Allan|proven alternative]] is to send the DMCA to their [http://inforelay.com/ Datacenter/ISP] [[spam|multiple times]], who will eventually [http://twitter.com/Dragoneer/statuses/26508573833 tell him] to stop being a child and remove the content.

Dragoneer is also responsible for managing Furaffinity's [[Jew Gold]] that comes in from donations and ad revenue. At the same time, Furaffinity is always low on funds and every time a server slows down or breaks due to poor coding, [[moar]] money is needed to fix the problem. Where could all the money be going? Remember the iPhone Sandwich earlier? [[Theft|yeahhhhhh...]]

If you post a journal and question where the money goes, you will get a private message from Dragoneer (which are not private, as [[FurAffinity]] staff can check notes for security reasons, even if the reason is curiosity). He will politely ask you to remove the journal entry, or he will have no choice but to ban you. If you keep questioning where the money goes, you will get permanently banned. See [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1580816/ this journal] as an example on what not to do.
 
If you're an [[furry art|artist]] and upload furry porn, you will have around 20 or 30,000 pageviews, if not more.
In fact, you might even multiply it by 10, as [[FurAffinity]] only counts registered members' views only. This has always been the strategy of FurAffinity's staff, as admitted by [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/lexyeevee/ Eevee], a site coder on [[Furnet]]'s #FurAffinity-Dev chatroom years ago. (Eevee was banned in mid-October for exploiting a huge security hole in FA's new "comment hiding" option - being able to "hide" comments even if you weren't the owner of the journal/submission. Eevee is definitely [[an hero]] for finding this out. Details of the exploits can be found [http://eevee.livejournal.com/329409.html here] and [http://eevee.livejournal.com/329817.html here]).

By this efficient philosophy, "devaluing" the site's audience on purpose justifies the donations, and, as always, all the [[gullible]] members believe this.
[[Image:Furry_Numbers.jpg|thumb|right| Commissions!]]

===You are Manipulated===
If you upload anything containing a dragon, a penis, and/or any male Digimon (preferably Murasadramon, as that is Dragoneer's fursona) on FurAffinity, you will definitely be watched by Dragoneer himself. Great! You two are best friends now! You wouldn't grieve against a friend, would you?

Dragoneer will [[lie|love your art]], even if your gallery hasn't received a single visit in weeks. If you're really good, there's a chance that he'll request you to draw something involving his character he will +fav, or even commission you, or best yet, make you an admin!

Samefaggotry is also a common technique used, even abused by Dragoneer on FurAffinity. Sometimes, he logs on as Sciggles to backup his arguments, and even often another unknown random account that nobody knows. However, he often tends to fail hard using this technique, which requires to log out and log in as your sockpuppet account. 
[[Image:Lolwutneer.png|center|Here's one of the multiple attempts from Dragoneer at sockpuppeting, but resulting into an epic failure.]]

[http://inkjammer.deviantart.com/ His DeviantART] has also been used to reinforce his arguments in favor of himself, claiming that he is awesome and a legit administrator. Unfortunately, everyone saw him coming a mile away due to his response time. Thanks to DeviantART (and certain administrators who are aware of Dragoneer's actions there), you can easily hide or delete these comments.
===I am banned. What do I do?===
[[Image:AllanNeerOMG.jpg|thumbnail|right|Give Dragoneer a special favor and he'll unban you!]]
[[Image:Dragoneer_bans.jpg|thumb|left|In art form.]]
"One shalt drink the semen of the Dragoneer to be forgiven for their acts and get unbanned."

This is the secret! The Dragoneer may ask you to:

*Draw his request, or ask you to commission one of his favorite artists to draw his character fucking yours.
*Donate at least $50 ($100 or more if you're permabanned) to retrieve access to your gallery.
*Never question his strategy, actions, or anything his staff does, especially [[Pinkuh]].

In addition, you may be required to watch him in return and to write a journal, apologizing for being a troll (or an undisciplined puppy) and state that you will quit grieving and obey the rules forever.

If you are an artist or just a user who draws porn, you have to additionally leave the other sites you post at, post exclusively on FurAffinity, and keep a low profile. This literally means offering your ass to Dragoneer, because he owns the Internet's most popular furry website, if not the fandom.

It actually worked for Wildwulf, aka Brandon Vongthongthrip, a notorious zoophile previously banned to avoid FurAffinity's bad reputation. FurAffinity didn't want to be shown as a harvest for [[bestiality|zoophiles]]. However, he and FurAffinity remain one.

===Dragoneer versus Other Sites===
Dragoneer is a pretty cool guy, but when you know him more personally then it becomes interesting. Here's a sample of a conversation from the week following [[e621]].net's takedown by InsaneKangaroo, and some WYS goons - a group of pro-FA furry [[whiteknight|whiteknights]] [[blowjob|showing their support]] to Dragoneer.

This [[Anon]] knows Dragoneer for about two years, and confirms Dragoneer's opinions and ambitions toward rival, yet better websites, instead of improving his own.

{{cs2|DragoneerChatTranscript|Chat Transcript|

'''[[Tl;dr]]''', Fagoneer thinks FA should be the only furry site ever and that he is a total Nazi. What is new?

==Gallery of Horrors==
Dragoneer can [[trace|draw]], too! Actually, all he can draw is gay Digimon porn, but occasionally he requests himself raping people he hates or have banned.

==Well obviously we have a rapist in Furaffinity==
Zaush "the furry rapist song"
"He's all up in your fandom, snatching your artists up, tryin' to rape 'em
So y'all need to hide yo mates, hide yo cubs hide yo mates, hide yo cubs, 'cause he's rapin everybody out here
You don't have to come and confess, we know it was you. We saw the notes. So you can run and tweet that, run and tweet that, run and tweet that, homeboy, home home homeboy.
We got yo chat logs and all them notes, you are so dumb, you are really dumb, for real.
You are really really really really so dumb. I was attacked by some creeper in the fandom.

He's a popular artist, draws lots of porn, likes sizeplay, and was a swinger.
And I seen the notes when he was rapin her, and that's not all that he did.
He's all up in your fandom, snatching your artists up, tryin' to rape 'em
So y'all need to hide yo mates, hide yo cubs hide yo mates, hide yo cubs, 'cause he's rapin everybody out here
You don't have to come and confess, we know it was you. We saw the notes. So you can run and tweet that, run and tweet that, run and tweet that, homeboy, home home homeboy.
Well, obviously we have a rapist in the furry fandom. Are you serious? I have your chat logs, I have the notes, I know what you said, even though you hid, we all found out.

A "popufur" furry named Zaush right in king fur's(dragoneer) convention raped a girl at a furcon.  But rather than turn in Zaush to the cops, cause the guy constantly had money being flung at him for commissions, he told the girl who got raped to try and like it.
Well the victims brother didn't give a shit about "protecting the image of furry", rather than let 'neer get away with helping a rapist, he bashed right through Fa's security, with not even so much of a challenge.  The brother then proceeded to wreak havoc on furaffinity.  Hacking all the mods and admins, trying to get as much information to put Zaush and Dragoneer behind bars.  He took screenshots of extremely damning stuff that the Admins had said and spread it all about.
{please post the screenshots by the hacker to get Dragoneer behind bars}

==Trivia==
[[File:Zaushblacksquares.png|right|thumb|If anyone else did this, they'd meet the [[banhammer]].]]
*Dragoneer is a secret [[babyfur]]. <strike>This is why cub art is still allowed on FurAffinity, regardless</strike> of it being shit. He even told the [[UK]] users to [[GTFO]] when their lolicon ban came in.
*His best friend is a sex offending [[pedophile]] who got banned from FurAffinity, but still gets to see kids in real life.
*Every administrator he has ever hired has been a pedophile/zoophile/anal retentive [[Nazi]] bastard, most notably the notorious dogfucker known as Chase.
*His nephew date-raped a girl, went on a crime spree, then got busted trying to steal some of Dragoneer's shit at his mother's house.
*If Dragoneer posts something on his blog, everyone must agree with it. ALWAYS.
*FA isn't his website. He stole it in 2006 when he was just a lead moderator. He claimed that he invested over $2,000 in donations to become "legit". Having all the moderators on your site sure helps!
*It is a known fact that Dragoneer relaxes the rules to his [[sick fuck|favorite]] artists. For example, in April 2010 [[Adam Wan]] [[Delete fucking everything|DELETED FUCKING EVERYTHING]] from his gallery and replaced each submission with a black square. Even though that's [http://wiki.furaffinity.net/index.php?title=AUP in direct violation of multiple portions of the AUP], Dragoneer said nothing and refused to do anything about it.
*[[Glenn Beck|Dragoneer raped and murdered a young girl in 1990]].

|“Because they're mass [[hacking]] accounts, using [[phishing]] techniques and other shitty script-level methods to [[steal|hijack]] people's shit (mostly due to people's own stupidity) and he's doing it in your name.”| –Dragoneer, [[rage|raging]] over [[raeped]] users

|"I don't want to rotate banners, as that's very bandwidth heavy and would be a little counter-productive. I'm not AGAINST it, but I don't want to."| -[[Doing it wrong|Administrating a website doesn't require work.]]

|“You had severe resentment towards us over it, but you've always been civil to me... so I dunno”| - A very confused Neer

|"I generally [[Lie|never]] go to ED. <nowiki>"Facts"</nowiki> are sometimes optional there."| -Dragoneer

|"Dragoneer is a thief. What right does he have to harass [[Allan]] for swindling donation money when he's doing the same thing and far worse? The site's layout is using something that would be fine 10 years ago but many sites have better, the servers are junk, the staff are all pedos. He hires friends and incompetents to mod the site while openly allowing popular people and friends to break rules and do what the fuck they want.

Fursuits, iPhones used as bread, commissions, name it, he's not spending money on the site. If he were, the site would be better."| -Anonymous

|"When I met Dragoneer at AC, it was really disturbing, for, he had no other subjects than his characters and who drew them. I really had a weid feeling, like having a 12yo in front of me into his Digimon games... Sean(Dragoneer) is devoid of maturity. Just like a kid in middleschool who bullies others around, he tries to be a smartass toward those who are around him, including; and especially artists. ''look; here's V**** this guy sucks, he thinks he's better than N**** but he's jsut a ripoff.'' Meeting Sean like this really made me feel bad for frequenting such retards."| -An anonymous artist

|"Furaffinity is free, unlike Deviantart who charges you to access certain content, options and discussion boards, that's the reason why I decided to create Furaffinity. Freedom and respect versus profit altough we are not a paysite, hosting Furaffinity requires a budget so we let the freedom to the users to donate, and these users are granted of my respect and my interest."| -Dragoneer, being hypocrite

|"No, Deviantart is the wrong site to go if you want to get a name in this community, that's the reason why I created [Furaffinity] Y'know, the photoshop artists like Axer, Vaporotem or Barachan may be blindfolded by the pageviews they make here, but they only support an egoistical administration that doesn't give a fuck or know shit about the furry culture, and the few members like Skifi, who actually play a role of mediator here; are even more retarded for not seeing the truth."| -Dragoneer, publicly admitting he hate Deviantart on IRC

|"Why do you want an alternative to Furaffinity? We're here for good."| -Dragoneer
