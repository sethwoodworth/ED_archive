[[Nerdcore]] group widely popular with [[Goons]] and [[Drama whore]]s, [http://www.futuristicsexrobotz.com Futuristic Sex Robotz] (signed to 19 Newborn Baby Goat Records) was founded by an AIDS infected John Holmes and {{lj|user=ziggens}} in late November of 2004 during a drunken haze produced by 24oz cans of Keystone Ice. 

Their first single, "Welcome to the Internet," a scathing, violent, and hilarious take on internet culture covering everything from [[Spyware]] to [[Rachelle Waterman]], was wildly popular in [[Good Korea]] and the internets at large, having been promoted by [[Dave Chappelle]] as well as [[Nicholas Morency]]. Was that sentence [[TL;DR|long enough for you]]?

In early 2005, additional members were added to the group and in April of 2005, Futuristic Sex Robotz released their second single about the Xbox game "''Halo 2''" titled, "Don't Make Us Kick Your Ass," along with a music video produced entirely as [[Mechanophile|machinima]]. The video has been downloaded [[over 9000|over 500,000]] times since its release and is wildly known as the funniest ''Halo'' video ever made, setting it apart from [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|everything else]] ever made ever.

Futuristic Sex Robotz released their first full album Hotel Coral Essex (HOTel cORAL esSEX as specified in the album art) for [http://www.futuristicsexrobotz.com/?p=music free download] in DRM-free format (fuck the [[RIAA]]) in February 2006. As of August 19th, 2006, FSR's mp3s are the most downloaded things [[evar]], besides AMVs.

Unfortunately, the Futuristic Sex Robotz have gone MIA. Their website (and thus their downloads) are down and one of the last communications from one of the crew states that 3 of them are now "working for Bungie", though you can still find [http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4088807/Futuristic_Sex_Robotz_(FSR)_-_Hotel_Coral_Essex_(2006) a torrent of the mp3s] on [[The Pirate Bay]] or else, if you're too retarted to use torrents you can download the zip or individual tracks on [http://www.futuristicsexrobotz.net/ FuturisticSexRobotz.net] .

What?<br />
My [[Internet]] isn't working.  Come fix it.  Oh, and by the way.  When you get back from Anchorage, I'm sending your ass to fat camp!<br />
<br />
Hey, yo, man.  After we're done roastin' this bitch, let's go to the Super [[Wal-Mart]].  Get that new Creed album.<br />
Ah, yeah, man.  [[Scott Stapp]], that guy's a musical genious.<br />
One of the great minds of our generation.<br />
<br />
Man, look at that.  We're burnin' this van so good, no one's every gonna figure out what we did.<br />

Sit down and take five while I defrag your drive,<br />
With Jack in the Box tacos and a dope G5,<br />
If you bought [[MySpace]] Records: Volume 1,<br />
I'm gonna shoot you in the face with my internet gun,<br />
My harddrive is huge, [[MP3]]s are external,<br />
Back up off the urinal and write in my [[LiveJournal]],<br />
At the 'puter all night 'cuz my life is nocturnal,<br />
Data backup assures that my [[porn]] is eternal,<br />
"You crazy," that's what all those [[bitches]] got to say,<br />
So I whip it out and post a pic in my LJ,<br />
Friends-only 'cuz I don't want my [[Mom]] to see,<br />
If she saw, she'd cut off the internet and cable [[TV]],<br />
But I don't give a fuck about those internet hoes,<br />
I gotta cut em off before they want to propose,<br />
'Cuz the [[herpes]] isn't covered by my HMOs,<br />
[[Delete]] 'em from my buddy list,<br />
that's how it goes.<br />

I'll infect you with Sasser and MS Blaster,<br />

NES at the Shack is how I first got down,<br />
Pops got a job, moved the fam to Sea-town,<br />
Checkin' [[BBS]]'s for my [[warez]] and porn,<br />
Around this time the mafia was born,<br />
Spendin' mad hours getting buff in [[LORD]],<br />
Get with the tavern ho, show off my long sword,<br />
Couple years later, hit the Hotline scene,<br />
Waitin' in queue is where I've never been seen,<br />
Got hooked up with fat accounts,<br />
Get my shit fast and in large amounts,<br />
Use my Cyrix chip to cook my meals,<br />
Laugh all you want, I'll own yo' ass at Wacky Wheels,<br />
Got my emulators and a couple thousand ROMs <br />
And all the F-Kiss from blah blah dot com,<br />
Now we got Torrents and [[bandwidth]] up to our necks,<br />
Looking back's crazy, but I wonder what's next.<br />

Back in the day, Shufflepuck Cafe,<br />

Once I got a modem I was never fuckin' bored,<br />
Always dialin' up a BBS to play me some LORD,<br />
I stole my school's dial-up to get the internet,<br />
Had a copy of Ircle and no regrets,<br />
Chillin' in #macfilez, leechin' on bots,<br />
It took nine years to get a download spot,<br />
Hours and hours, makin' Marathon maps,<br />
Always on the run 'cuz I set it to caps,<br />
Eventually I got a brand new Power Mac,<br />
So fuckin' fast, I almost had a heart attack,<br />
Ran a Hotline server on my school's T1,<br />
"Win Ben Stein's Warez" was the name of that one,<br />
Quake 3 Test in the computer lab,<br />
Never went to class 'cuz that shit was a drag.<br />

Blake Stone or some Duke 3D,<br />
IPX LAN, don't fuck with me,<br />
Back in the day we had four buttons man,<br />
Gravis GamePad 'til we lost our tan,<br />
ZZT, where I made my first game,<br />
Shit was mad hot 'til Click-n-Play came,<br />
Up in the attic, it's Jumpin Flash,<br />
All day long 'til a [[PlayStation]] crash,<br />
Pirated Thrill Kill, what a waste of time,<br />
Now I get why they trashed that crime,<br />
We got nerd history, stories for days,<br />
Spit it how I lived it 'til this shit pays,<br />
So back up off if you question the cred,<br />
OG nerds, we'll cut off your head.<br />

Yo, back in the day, shit was the best,<br />
I pirated Duke Nukem off a BBS,<br />
A pimp with a 486 dx, deuce,<br />
Double piped to increase my juice,<br />
Halloween Harry and Commander Keen,<br />
Nowadays, it seems like a wonderful dream,<br />
Up in school, I'm on the LC 2s,<br />
Used the backdoor to drop right outta Foolproof,<br />
Then one day, there was the internet,<br />
And anything I wanted, I could easily get,<br />
Anytime I wanted A-double-P-Z,<br />
Just connect to H-O-T-L-I-N-E,<br />
Click the banner, fourth word, seventh line,<br />
Log in and anything I wanted was mine,<br />
I started up a server called "Industrial Strength,"<br />
And got sued by the R-I-double-A,<br />
But I was born into a new world of computers,<br />
And we became a generation of looters,<br />
But I said it before, and I'll say it again,<br />
It's like bein' high just rememberin'.<br />

Let me tell you about a [[man]] from the 24th century,<br />
put a lot of fools in a [[space]] penitentiary.<br />
He's the futuristic [[sex]] [[android]],<br />
too cool for [[school]] or bad hemorrhoids.<br />

Felis Catus is your taxonomic nomenclature,<br />
an endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature.<br />
Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses,<br />
contribute to your hunting skill and natural defenses.<br />
I find myself intrigued by your sub-vocal oscillations,<br />
a singular development of cat communication,<br />
that obviates your basic hedonistic predilections,<br />
for a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection.<br />
A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents,<br />
you would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance,<br />
and when not being utilized to aid in locomotion,<br />
it often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.<br />
Oh Spot, the levels of behavior you display,<br />
connote a fairly well developed cognitive array,<br />
and though you are not sentient and do not comprehend,<br />
I nonetheless consider you a true, valued friend.<br />

Got home from work and I had some time,<br />
So I opened up WoW and I got online,<br />
Logged into my Shaman up on Daggerspine,<br />
When this maxed out motherfucker tried to take what's mine,<br />
He said "I spent a thousand hours and I failed out of school,<br />
And to justify it, I challenge you to a duel"<br />
I said thats okay, I know you'd beat me,<br />
Look at me I'm not even at level 20,<br />
I've got one of those things that they call a job,<br />
And so I can't spend all day, runnin a mob,<br />
Motherfucker kept pushin', wouldn't leave me alone,<br />
I said fine bitch, pretend to be Sylvester Stallone,<br />
After he won he started talkin hella shit,<br />
And I thought to myself, "Is this fool legit?"<br />
I called Recycle Bin and Subrandom to the place,<br />
And they found the little bitch and regulated on his face,<br />
See, we don't take no shit from internet [[teenager]]s,<br />
Pretending to to be straight gangster ass bangers,<br />
Step out of cyberspace and come over to my place,<br />
I got a level 60 bullet for your motherfuckin' face.<br />

We got all these farmers rollin' on gear,<br />
Now we quick to boot em the fuck out of here,<br />

{{cs2|livejournal|Livejournal|
Thursday, November 18th, two-thousand and four.<br />
After returning home from a holiday in Anchorage,<br />
where she had visited the [[Hot Topic]] department store,<br />
[[Rachelle Waterman]] made this cryptic post in her online diary:
Just to let you know, my mother was [[murder]]ed.<br />
I won't have [[computer]] access until the weekend or so,<br />
because the [[police]] took my computer to go through the hard drive.<br />
I thank everyone for their thoughts and emails.<br />
I hope to talk to you when I get my computer back.</blockquote>
It is later revealed that Rachelle had enlisted the services,<br />
of two of her ex-boyfriends to lock her mother inside of a van,<br />
and then burn it.<br />
<br />Approximately one year later, a sixteen-year-old girl known online as,<br />
[[rockonlittleone]], was taken into custody.<br />
She had allegedly stabbed her mother to death.<br />
<br />
What could have caused these seemingly unrelated murders?<br />
The only thread connecting these incidents is the internet website known,<br />
as LiveJournal.com.<br />
We attempted to contact the website's creator, [[bradfitz]],<br />
but we were stymied by his press secretary.<br />
The only thing that we know for sure, is that LiveJournal is a [[disease]].<br />
A disease that infects anyone who is exposed to it,<br />
imparting them with the will to kill their mothers.<br />
This pandemic, like [[AIDS]], will continue to kill again and again and again,<br />
until stopped.<br />

{{cs2|bttf|Back to the Future|
If my calculations are correct,<br />
When this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour,<br />
You're going to see some serious shit.<br />
<br />
My flows hit you at straight eighty-eight,<br />
Miles per hour that's enough to generate,<br />
One point twenty-one jigowatts son,<br />
And I'm on the run, from the Libyans,<br />
It was a straight-jack move for plutonium,<br />
And when the van rolls up it's pandemonium,<br />
One eighteen AM at Twin Pines Mall,<br />
Is when I can pinpoint my total downfall,<br />
Now they say Doc Brown, he was a lonely man,<br />
But his time machine was a DeLorean,<br />
He said "You're gonna go back, you gotta do it in style,<br />
Or take your ass on back down to 8 mile."<br />
My life is flashin' before my eyes,<br />
And the bullets is flyin' across the skies,<br />
They got my homie, Doc, and yo he ain't gonna make it,<br />
The Libyans is comin' back around, I gotta take it,<br />
Jam in the keys, then I slam it into gear,<br />
Stomp the gas to get the fuck outta here,<br />
And if this wasn't enough of a disaster,<br />
Libyans on my tail, I'm goin' faster and faster,<br />
Happened to be plutonium in the Flux Capacitor.<br />
<br />
And now I'm headed back to '55 with no passenger,<br />
I wish that I had packed myself a travel kit,<br />
'Cuz Doc was right, hit 88 and saw some serious shit,<br />
I roll up quick and I bust into a farm,<br />
And then I'm like "Hey, sorry, about your barn"<br />
About this time I had the realization,<br />
That it was '55 in the U.S. nation,<br />
Now I gotta find out what the fuck I'm facin',<br />
Without destroyin' history in the makin',<br />
<br />
Gotta find some time to collect my thoughts,<br />
So I dip into a diner and analyze my plots,<br />
A guy walks up, "Can I take your order?"<br />
I musta sounded like I had a mental disorder,<br />
He said "I can't give you a Pepsi, free,<br />
You gotta pay for that shit, see?"<br />
Just about then, a man walks by,<br />
And he's like "Yo, I'm talkin' to you, McFly"<br />
I try to hold back a reaction that's knee-jerk,<br />
And Biff is like "Yo McFly, where's my homework?<br />
Don't trick me around, or I be fightin',<br />
How's it gonna look, my homework in your handwritin'?"<br />
<br />
So I dip out the diner, my coffee, I swallow,<br />
Keep a low profile, my father, I follow,<br />
When I find him, he's peeping on my mom in a tree,<br />
Like hidden_camera_sluts.mpg,<br />
He falls into the street, to my disdain,<br />
So I tackle him outta the way, like ESPN,<br />
So I'm hit by a car and I gotta sustain,<br />
Gramps busts out "They jumped out in front of my car again!"<br />
I don't yet know it but I'm not in luck,<br />
Seein' my dad has made the timeline totally fucked,<br />
I wake up in a room, am I goin' insane?<br />
A hot slut says "Howdy, my name is Lorraine,"<br />
I'm like "What the fuck?  Is this my mom?<br />
Definitely is, and she is comin' on strong."<br />
It's been a common scene, but I made it out alive.<br />
<br />
Now I'm headin' on over, to Riverside Drive,<br />
Gotta meet the doc, Emmett Brown,<br />
And find out what's really goin' on in this town,<br />
You couldn't believe me, if you're so inclined,<br />
Doc opens the door and tries to read my mind,<br />
I said "I'm from the future, I know it sounds demented.<br />
I came here in a time machine that you invented.<br />
And now it's come down to stayin' alive.<br />
I gotta get back to 1985."<br />
Eventually I manage to convince the old man,<br />
We head out to where I hid the delorean,<br />
I hook up the camera from the video shoot,<br />
and we see this old doc in a radiation suit.<br />
He says "Radiation suit, of course!
Because the fallout from the atomic wars!"<br />
We keep movin' on and he's like "Great Scott!<br />
One point twenty-one jigowatts?!?  The proposition at hand,<br />
is very frightenin'.  For that kinda power,<br />
would need a bolt of lightnin'.<br />
You never know when or where it's gonna strike"<br />
Just like my devastatin' flows on the mic.<br />
It might have seemed as if, the fates had conspired,<br />
because I happened to have information on a flier.<br />
Now I just have to wait to saturday,<br />
so I can chill out and smoke [[weed]] everyday.<br />
<br />
It might seem sad but I'm sorry to say,<br />
Story just doesn't happen to end that way,<br />
I say "The fact, bears repeatin', that i happened to interfere,<br />
with my parents' first meeting.<br />
Gotta lay low and make this right,<br />
So my parents can hook up at the dance at night."<br />
But I run into some problems in this quest,<br />
'Cuz my dad is a total idiot at best,<br />
how can I get my mom to give him a chance,<br />
so they can hook up at the undersea dance?"<br />
<br />
The only way that I can get rid of all this friction,<br />
Is to use a little bit of [[science fiction]],<br />
Break into his house and scare him with Van Halen.<br />
And tell him "This dance you better not be bailin'."<br />
<br />
The long story short, it worked out in the end,<br />
And my mom's honor, he did defend.<br />
Turns out that Biff was out of luck,<br />
Ran his brand new car into a manure truck,<br />
In the end I found out at last,<br />
That my mom's a drunken slut who takes it in the ass,<br />
And all of Biff's homies I found out that they were,<br />
To pussy to mess with those addicts of reefer,<br />
And at the dance, I rocked everybody,<br />
Played [[guitar]] until my hands were bloody,<br />
Lightning struck the tower, 4 after 10,<br />
and I made it back to the future, again.<br />
<br />
So why don't you make like a tree, and get outta here?<br />
<br />
It's so hard nowadays, with all the gangs and rap music.<br />
What about [[robots]]?<br />
Oh, they're everywhere.<br />
I don't even know why the scientists make them.<br />

Motherfucker, they're all about [[penis]]es,<br />
My world was perfect 'til I got high on [[meth]],<br />
And then I got that horse to fuck me to death.<br />
<br />
'''Motherboard:'''<br />
If I ruled the world, ('''Coaxke:''' All the hackers would unite.)<br />
I'd free all my sons, ('''Coaxke:''' Have a picnic at the beach, fly an internet kite.)<br />
Black diamonds and pearls,<br />
If I ruled the world. ('''Coaxke:''' Furries wouldn't get to fuck underage girls.)<br />
<br />
'''Motherboard:'''<br />
And you walk up to the Gibson, hand in hand,<br />
Walk up to the Gibson, hack it man.<br />
<br />
'''Recycle Bin:'''<br />
[[Lindsay Lohan]] would have never lost weight,<br />
And all the porno she was in would be great,<br />
I'd never see a [[dick]] in a [[titty]] community,<br />
There's other fuckin' places for that kinda nudity,<br />
My Empornium ratio would always be at 1,<br />
No one would seed shit where the bitches weigh a ton,<br />
FSR videos introduced by Razor and Blade,<br />
And [[Zero Cool]] would finally get laid,<br />
Cereal would find a pair of rollerblade sandals,<br />
And Joey would get himelf a 1337 ass handle,<br />
We'd all have them [[Japanese]] toilets for stoolin',<br />
If I ruled the world, it'd be great, no foolin'.<br />
<br />

{{cs2|justafriend|Just a Friend (Secret Track)|
'''Recycle Bin:'''<br />
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date.<br />
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait.<br />
Let me tell ya a story of my situation.<br />
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation.<br />
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert.<br />
She had long hair and a short miniskirt.<br />
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat.<br />
I was walkin through the crowd and guess who I met.<br />
I whispered in her ear, come to the picture booth.<br />
So I can axe you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof.<br />
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah.<br />
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra.<br />
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused.<br />
I said, "How do you like the show?"<br />
She said, "I was very amused."<br />
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range.<br />
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange.<br />
Then when I asked "Do ya have a man?" she tried to pretend.<br />
She said, "No I don't, I only have a [[friend]]."<br />
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it.<br />
Here's what I'm gonna sing.<br />
<br />
'''All:'''<br />
You, you got what I need, but you say he's [[Friend Zone|just a friend.]]<br />
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby.<br />
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend.<br />
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby.<br />
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend.<br />
But you say he's just a friend.<br />
<br />
'''Recycle Bin:'''<br />
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time.<br />
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime,<br />
'cuz I have friends and that's a fact.<br />
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq.<br />
Forget about that, let's go into the story.<br />
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me.<br />
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar.<br />
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up.<br />
A relationship or some understanding.<br />
How its gonna be in the future we was plannin'.<br />
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet.<br />
I had no idea I was in for a treat.<br />
After this was established, everything was cool.<br />
The tour was over and she went back to school.<br />
I called every day to see how she was doin.<br />
Everytime that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'.<br />
I called her on my dime, picked up, and then I called again.<br />
I said, yo, who was that?  Oh, he's just a friend.<br />
Pssh, come on, don't gimme dat.<br />
Jus bust this.<br />
<br />
'''All:'''<br />
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend.<br />
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby.<br />
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend.<br />
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby.<br />
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend.<br />
But you say he's just a friend.<br />
<br />
'''PC Speaker:'''<br />
So I came to her college on a surprise visit.<br />
To see my girl that was so exquisite.<br />
It was a school day, I knew she was there.<br />
at The first semester of the school year.<br />
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm.<br />
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form.<br />
He told me where it was and I as on my way.<br />
her told me had baby doll, I was happy to say.<br />
I arrived in front of the dormitory.<br />
Yo, could you tell me where is door three?<br />
Could they show me where it was for the moment.<br />
I didnt know such an event.<br />
So I came to her room, and opened her door.<br />
Oh, snap!  Guess what I saw?<br />
Another killa... fes... fuckin' kissin' my girl in the mouth.<br />
I was so... knock out, sweat down south.<br />
So please listen to the message that I send.<br />
Dont ever talk to a girl who says she just got a friend.<br />
<br />
'''PC Speaker:''' Will that work for what you guys wanted?<br />
'''Subrandom:''' You're really fucking high now. Not like before, when you were like, "I'mma smoke a lil weed..." you're fucking high. You can't even do anything but play with your god damn lighters<br />
'''Recycle Bin:''' That was bad.<br />
'''Coaxke:''' Pieces of shit! Get the fuck out of my bar!<br />

{{cs2|soap|Snakes on a Plane|
'''PC Speaker:'''<br />
I was flyin' on a plane to Californ-i-a,<br />
when I met this guy whose name was [[Samuel L. Jackson|Sammy J]].<br />
Got a gin and tonic, Sapphire Bombay.<br />
Sammy said "I prefer number 10, Tanqueray."<br />
After a few, he looks me right in the eye.<br />
"Keep it on the DL, I'm with the [[FBI]].<br />
I'm on this plane to escort this guy,<br />
he can take down the mafia if he testifies."<br />
And then I felt safe, like nothing could go wrong,<br />
oh shit, there's a snake comin' out that bitch's thong.<br />
I remember the time Nas spoke to me,<br />
he said "Life's a B and then you D."<br />
I'm downin' my drink, gettin' ready to die,<br />
but Sammy J stands up and says "Not tonight.<br />
I got a job to do, enough is enough.<br />
I've had it with these motherfuckin' snakes and stuff!<br />
Gonna get this guy to court, safe and sane.<br />
I want these motherfucking snakes off this motherfucking plane!"<br />
At this point I passed out after a hand-full of Xanax,<br />
and when I woke up, we were safe at LAX.<br />
<br />
'''Snakes:''' Sssnakesss! ('''Recycle Bin:''' What?)<br />
'''Subrandom:''' On a plane! We got snakes up on a plane!<br />
'''Snakes:''' Sssnakesss! ('''Recycle Bin:''' What?)<br />
'''Subrandom:''' On a plane! We got snakes!<br />
'''Coaxke:''' Snakes on a motherfucking plane!<br />
<br />
'''Coaxke:'''<br />
I went to the bathroom to make a stink,<br />
when this motherfuckin' snake came up through the sink.<br />
On a flight to hell, no time to think,<br />
gotta get to the cart and have another drink.<br />
A snake in every tube and inside every pipe,<br />
how could this be the end of my life.<br />
If airport security had let me bring a knife.<br />
I could make it home alive to my best friend's wife.<br />
They're coming up through the floor.<br />
I got bit on my hand and I'm feelin' sore.<br />
Unhinged its jaw to take in my head.<br />
I wish that it was Jennifer Connelly instead.<br />
<br />
'''Snakes:''' Sssnakesss! ('''Recycle Bin:''' What?)<br />

What if your dick was as big as the ocean,<br />
it'd be the only snake not encroachin',<br />
on your seat when you get them free nuts,<br />
anacondas chompin' all the fly butts.<br />
When I looked around, wished I'd taken the train,<br />
there were snakes all over the motherfuckin' plane.<br />
Or better yet, snakes in your brain,<br />
pulse be racin' like you're smokin' [[cocaine]].<br />
Plane stacked with snakes, the flight's non-stop.<br />
I got more butts than a cigarette shop.<br />
Just another day on the TWA,<br />
suckin' out poison, don't say that I'm [[gay]].<br />
<br />

get my big ass to the Robotz show, son.<br />
Find my seat, first class, settle in,<br />
stewardess winkin' like she knows Recycle Bin.<br />
"Bring a double rum and meet me in the can."<br />
"Yo, Coaxke, hurry up with that shit, man.<br />
There's this fine ass bitch, I'ma do in the booth,<br />
get up in that shit like a [[ninja]] pussy sleuth."<br />
Work that shit hard, leave a bitch screamin',<br />
little did I know, there's a grippa snakes schemin'.<br />
Fucker bit her in the ass, man, that's whack,<br />
left the ground a player, now I'm a necrophiliac.<br />
