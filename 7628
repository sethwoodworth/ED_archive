So-called
A phrase which generates drama while merely stating the obvious.  '''So-called''' carries with it a connotation of fraud, counterfeit, or deceit. However, the literal meaning of the phrase is absolutely harmless -- things are "so-called" because that's what they are named.  

[[Dramacrat]]s can generate a great deal of animosity and angst by appending '''so-called''' liberally to whatever nouns the victim holds dear.  For example, one might refer to a [[teenmommies|teenmommy]]'s '''so-called''' "baby", or to George Bush as the '''so-called''' "President".  (The superfluous quotation marks, while [[grammar Nazi|ungrammatical]], serve to reinforce the same perceived air of illegitimacy.) The [[fucktard]]s in question are almost certain to react harshly, without even considering the [[ironic]] fact that the troll is only stating the truth: the [[teenmommies|teenmommy]]'s baby ''is'' called a baby, and George Bush ''is'' called the President.

Like [[alleged]], '''so-called''' thus provides an excellent means of appearing hostile and derogatory while skating merrily around the issue of [[defamation]]. If used correctly, a troll can [[pwn]] someone whilst [[lulz|laughing]] at their victims [[retard|stupidity]].
