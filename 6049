'''Operation Madeupname''' is a [[Unwarranted Self Importance|global all encompassing superwin global revolution]] created, marketed and implemented by the many legions of the all powerful [[Anonymous]] to end [[africa|world poverty]] and replace it with [[Rule 34]] that I just made up using my own [[retard|brain]].
