The [[MySpace]] [[spam|Newsletter]] is a marketing tool of [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s, sent to purposely install malware and download [[CP|kiddy porn]] onto your work/parent's computer. [[Tom Anderson]] personally contacts the [[shit|talented]] [[emo|bands]] which some division of [[Fox News|News Corporation]] is pushing this week.

==Newsletter, or Spam?==

Despite clearly selecting '''NO [[Spam|SPAM]] [[FAGGOT]]''' in the account settings, this [[retarded|esteemed]] journal is sent to [[you]] every month, clogging your [[internets]] [[tubes]] with shit loads of email, due to [[you]] having [[Sock puppet]] accounts to further your [[lonely|friend-making]] and avoid [[Chris Hansen]].

[[Al Gore]], inventor of [[internet]], convinced Tom to use his [[fact|ingenious plan]] to spread the word about [[global warming]] Since [[MySpace]] is the biggest polluter of [[internet]] [[tubes]], Tom was [[fangirl|ordered]] by his boss, [[Steve Irwin|Rupert Murdoch]] to [[rape]] [[Drama whore|Tipper]] several times with a cucumber. This caused much [[lulz]] for [[neo-cons|Fox Executives]], who uploaded the pix of the incident to [[b|/b/]], where their fellow racists could [[fap]] to them.
