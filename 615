'''Arkveveen''' has a mission - and that mission is to fight for the rights of [[fatties]] everywhere. 

Arkvevenn is like most other whiny furfags in that he has a [[fetish]] - in this case, what he calls "horny [[Fat|fatness]]". He spends most of his time [[whining]] about not finding a fat chick for him to [[fuck|love]], and drawing lots of fat chicks, fat herms, fat guys with huge moobs, and Care Bears that are also fat guys with huge moobs. He is also 20+ years old so that means he is clearly very experienced so [[serious business|don't fuck with him]] and [[shit]].

==The Art==
Most of Arkveveen's art consists of [http://data.furaffinity.net/art/arkveveen/1176681379.arkveveen_jessica_s_fat_passion.jpg fat passion] and [[BBW]], which means "bumpy bumpy wumpy". But wait, he occasionally draws [[hermaphrodite|herms]] as well! Really though, he's not fooling anyone: those pics are just males with overly huge man-boobs to lamely hide that he's in a fat closet of fatness for [[fatties]]. 

Occasionally he'll draw a thing called "corpulence bear" which is like a Care Bear but with yummy porkchops being consumed. This thing too hangs around with the so called "herms" of Arkveveen's. 

==The Person==
Arkveveen, like many furries, spends his time looking for Bumpy Bumpy Wumpy women to [[rape|mate with]]. He also likes to whine about fatness, fat, fatties, and also about the "[[Shay|obesity wars]]" that have claimed more fat people than [[Jews]] did in WW2 and that's counting the fat Jews too. Don't bother talking him out of it either, as he will cry "YOUR OPINIONS DON'T MATTER" and "I SENSE A CONFLICT", his mating calls. [[Steve Irwin|Someone]] was brave enough to confront this creature called Arkveveen about his futile search for a mate. For intents and purposes, this brave soul will be called "person" as they're cool like that.

'''[[All caps|CAPSLOCK]] IS NOT ONLY CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL, IT IS SHORTHAND FOR SERIOUS BUSINESS'''

==Fight Against Fat Discrimination!!1!==
He also has some interesting beliefs. From [http://arkveveen.blogspot.com/ his blog], we get the following:

*Exercise is evil and unnatural.
*The food pyramid was created by the [[Nazis]]. <small>Srsly, read below.</small>
*Hating fat fucks for being fat fucks also makes you a Nazi.

<center>{{morphquote|A1|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;

|There is really no actual evidence that food has any direct affect on your health, and is mostly composed of "junk food science" ... We need energy from food, as well as for our organs; yet can any of you who read this say HOW our brain or other various bodily systems work? Can you even name ONE thing? I can, and it's energy from food; which means food high in fat or calories is good for your body |Arkveveen, showing he certainly can't name one correct fact. McDonald's is the pinnacle of nutrition!

|Health isn't something humanity worried about awhile ago; why now, anyway? Isn't living to 50 good enough? Life is just too short to worry constantly about this crap, and it's about time I stopped worrying about my own health and get on with my life.|Only a 20 year old thinks 50 is old enough. And life wouldn't be quite so short if he lost some damn weight.

|The Food Pyramid is just another picture used to control people's lives when freedom of choice is first and foremost; ... Controlling how people should act, be, and live is wrong; even if it's to save lives, it's just the same as the Nazi's and Hitler. |Arkveveen, stating that the worst the Nazis can do is come up with food pyramids.

|Exercise is NOT fun, it's just exerting your body for no reason, and health is not a creation; it's not a productive thing, it only staves off the fear of death. We all HAVE TO DIE someday, and noone can tell when they will die. It's all variability in this case, but even my current words can't compensate for how I feel about this. It's as if art and any type of fun is considered a BAD thing; and all you should care about is living longer while living to make more babies. So some kids are not allowed to read now as they grow up, because it's unhealthy and doesn't involve exercise, when our bodies ALWAYS burn energy from just our organs working! |Arkveveen, who thinks sitting and fapping to fatty porn is exercise.

|A heartbreaking article that makes me MORE pissed off at my friend... does he seriously have no idea how much fat people are SUFFERING because of others? Just one incident of abuse towards a fat person means there is something wrong, especially if the abuse is directed at them because they are taking up two seats on a train or because they refuse to lose weight. Abuse is never right, no matter who it's directed at; we are all human beings deserving of at least SOME dignity and respect.|Arkvevenn bawws over [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8327753.stm a bitch so fat her ass took up two seats].

==The Future==
Apparently he is "successful," or so he says. This is obviously a [[lie]], as no artist of his [[Fat|EXTREME]] CALIBER is ever successful. With any luck he will become [[an hero]] like [[Tumbles the Stairdragon|so many have tried to do before him]].

==The Commissions==
He recently opened himself up for commissions and failed miserably. Deluding himself that the reason was that everyone was cheap and not that his work is an eyesore, he posted the following.

{{tinyquote|MAJOR UPDATE: I have become increasingly aware that I haven't been getting a lot of
commission requests. Why wouldn't anyone want some art from me? Especially all 200+
of people watching me on deviantART, and my growing popularity in FurAffinity. You
are watching me for a reason, right? I am really flattered as it is that I have so
many friends that like my art, so I am grateful. But I am NOT grateful for how you
all don't even pounce on any of my commission offers, unless 99% of you don't earn
any money by working. Do you think my art is nothing, so it isn't worth anything? 
Is it just SMUT for you? Porn CAN be art, because that's what it originally IS! No
offense to any of you, as I am really happy you are all watching me... but seriously,
do you think I have infinite money to pay for supplies? I am an adult, I need to 
quit asking my mom to give me money for art supplies and such when I could just earn
my own money EASILY by doing what I love... drawing art for others! But since none 
of you want any commissions, I won't post anything new on my DA page OR my FA page.
No new art for ANY of you. I am not trying to be greedy, but this is what the staff
for the Las Lindas webcomic does sometimes...they use donations or such so they 
will be motivated to draw an extra comic or add to their bonus comics; which is 
really good for those Las Lindas fans out there. Otherwise, there is no excuse for
any of you thinking I WON'T get a commission done since I have FOUR commissions done 
that really satisfied and pleased. I am quick, and efficient; and I also have tons 
of fun drawing for a living. But, I suppose I am just a loser who needs to get a 
real job...wait...this could BE a real job if I had a lot of commissions for once!!!|What a greedy dick.}}

==YouTube==
On September 28, 2009, Arkveveen submitted his first [[YouTube Poop|YTP]] *[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfBIh7KEcwg&feature=channel_page '''here'''].  This is a grand example of fail, even by YTP standards.  Lacking basic computer skills, Arkveveen resorted to using trial software instead of pirating a decent converter.
