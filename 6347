Perez Hilton
[[Image:Perez with gingivitis.jpg|thumb||There’s nothing like a bitchy queen with absolutely no sense of style and a connection to the internet.]]

[[Image:Perezhilton2010.jpg|thumb||[[DO NOT WANT]]]]

[[Mario]] Armando Lavandeira Jr., aka '''Perez Hilton''', and ''coollava1978'' on his [[AIM]], is a [[queen]]y Mexican [[whore|attention whore]] and troll IRL. Mario got himself seriously set up as the ventriloquist dummy of [[Paris Hilton]]'s campaign to conquer the media via the internets and leaked pr0n. 

A repulsive [[blogger]] and general [[shit|piece of shit]], Perez's site www.perezhilton.com is only frequented by [[16 year old girls]], [[homosexual|faggot]]s, [[transvestite]]s, [[whore]]s, [[sick fuck]]s and [[Your mom|middle-aged housewives]]. Many claim that his coverage of Paris Hilton and her friends and family is biased and has been accused of ignoring stories or rumors that casts the slutty heiress in a bad light. But liek, how could anyone possibly get that impression? 
However, due to no one giving a fuck about Paris Hilton anymore, Mario has dropped her and is doing his specialty: parasitically attaching himself to [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Katy Perry]] in his continuing bid to be the biggest attention whore ever. He is also, if you haven't realized, a complete [[faggot]]. 

== Overview ==
[[Image:Perez hilton mario gay.jpg|thumb|right|Perez circa June 2008: what he considers to be "skinny".]]
[[Image:Perez still a fatass.png|thumb|right|Perez circa July 2009: what he considers to be "skinnier still".]]

Mr. Lavandeira does not have a girlfriend, because he, like all dirty faggots, prefers another man's dick up his tailpipe. He is considerably overweight, but has made it a point to lose weight using weight loss medicine which is taken anally. This weight loss medicine is called the [[AIDS]] virus.

As [[unfunny]] as he is [[gay]], the grotesque Perez is a professional troll and ass kisser (but he insists on [[In the ass|using the tongue]]), and a [[MS Paint]] connoisseur. Perez's main goal in life is to [[unrealistic expectations|become a celebrity]], [[rich and beautiful]]. Even TOW acknowledges this: 
''Lavandeira's angle on [[celebrity]] gossip includes an unapologetic desire to mingle with and be a part of celebrity culture. He thus often describes celebrity awards shows, clubs, and private events he has attended, and posts photographs of himself with the celebrities he writes about under the "Personally Perez" category of his blog...''  '''I guess he can do whatever the fuck he wants on his own blog.'''

But [[God]] didn't grant him any gift, either physical, intellectual or artistic (or sexual), so he's channeling his hatred through [[ED|deliberately poisonous words]], and because of this he later got pwned IRL by the Black Eyed Pea's manager. Also, his mission (apart from being intensely repulsive) seems to be to out as many fags as possible. This is because he'd love to see the planet populated only by fags, something that most fags mistakenly believe necessary to become happy themselves as fags.

==Controversies==

===Miss USA Pageant 2009===

Mario somehow wormed his way from being a [[blogger|bloviator]] into being a [[judge]] at Donald Trump's Miss USA "pageant" of 2009. [[Fag]]/[[faghag]] factors apparently trump questions about how a dirty fag is qualified to judge one of the world's great soft-core [[fap]]fests for [[13 year old boy|adolescent boys]].

Mario asked the extremely [[hot]] [[Miss California 2009|Miss California]], Carrie Prejean, a tricky question about gay marriage, figuring that with [[leftard]]s still believing that [[Obama|mulatto Jesus]] is their all-round messiah, he'd have the crowd on his side.

Miss California answered honestly and politely, but it wasn't the answer Mario wanted. He minced off and spent the next week having a gigantic [[hissy fit]] on his blog about her answer while [[Unwarranted self-importance|boasting]] about how he'd been responsible for Miss Cali coming second instead of [[win]]ning. BAAAAAAAAAW

Carrie Prejean later proved to be a raging [[skank]], with [[at least 100]] sex tapes, a tit job, underage nude photographs, and an all around bitchy attitude.  

===Copyright Controversy===
[[Image:HisRideHome.JPG|thumb|195px|left|How I wish this were a [[photoshop]] manipulation.]]
A group of photo agencies is planning to sue him for using their photographs without permission. The suit alleges that Mr. Hilton—one of the most [[Jameth|popular bloggers]] on the Internet—has been using photos of celebrities such as Britney Spears and Paris Hilton without permission or payment, and that this harms the businesses of the photo agencies. This adds to the two other outstanding suits against Perez Hilton that also allege copyright infringement.

Most bloggers, journalists, news agencies and photographers have claimed that Hilton ''illegally'' posts photographs and exclusive content from other sites. However, Hilton has defended his use of the photographs by citing the use of the copyrighted material for [[satire]] (defined as legal with or without the permission of the copyright holder in the United States). On November 30, 2006, celebrity photo agency X17 filed a lawsuit against Hilton in federal court, seeking over '''$ 7.5 million''' in damages for copyright infringement. 


===Perez Gets KTFO (cries like teh biatch)===
[[Image:perezpunchface.jpg|thumb|right|[[I am disappoint|I am Disappoint]]: Black eye from the Black Eye Peas.]]
[[Last Thursday]] in [[Canada|Toronto]] at the [[MTV|MuchMusic Video Awards]] after party, Perez (being his [[douche|noble]] self) [[irony|called Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas a "faggot" and "gay"]] and was promptly punched in the eye by the [[Fat Larry's Band|band's]] manager. The story behind this was that fat-tits had called Black Eyed Peas <strike>frontwoman</strike> frontman Fergie a [[whore]] or something, and also referred to the band's latest album as a [[truth|piece of shit]]. [[butthurt|Taking offense to this]], Will.i.am went to see how much sack Perez had and called him on it. That's when Perez decided to be the [[lolwut|classy representative of the gay population]] and shot his fat mouth off. This caused no small amount of black rage in Will.i.am., because the truth always hurts. [[Image:will.jpg|thumb|right|[[gay|as if the suit isn't proof enough]]:]]  Following that, Perez's fat face was introduced to the manager's fist.

=== [[TL;DR]] Bawwing ===

Perez released a series of [[TL;DR]](like this shitty article) rants on his blog, which frequently state that "[[lie|violence is never the answer]]".  Ironically, Perez Hilton is proof positive that violence has its place.  Here are the distilled versions, so you don't have to sit through an even gayer version of [[Twilight]]:

|I am not nor have I ever claimed to be a spokesperson for the gay community.|Bullshit, Mario. You want to be the gay Jesse Jackson.
|But words should not provoke someone to violence.|Try going to Harlem, and calling a black guy a black person to his face, dumbass.
|Violence should never be condoned with such statements as "It's Karma" or "I don't believe in violence but….". In fact, several television and radio shows over the past couple of days echoed the sentiment "He had it coming".|He [[asking for it|had it coming]].
|[[yes|Would I have "deserved it" if I had been stabbed? Or shot? Or killed?]]|Don't get our hopes up like that.
|There are many ways to deal with disagreements, both good and bad, but violence is never the answer. Never.|Oh yeah? Two words: The Holocaust.

[[Some argue]] that these statements were made for various reasons, including pacifying the advertisers on his site (who were dropping like flies after the incident because of massive letter writing campaigns by both fans and haters), protecting his "brand", and to prevent Canuckistan forces for charging him with a hate crime for calling someone a faggot. [http://gawker.com/5302373/perez-hilton-apologizes-for-being-perez-hilton Yes, it's illegal to call someone a faggot in Canada]. In a further attempt to <s>keep his name in the news</s> play the victim, Perez filed a [[lolsuit]] against Polo Molina, the Black Eyed Peas manager that attacked him, seeking monetary compensation for "Infliction of emotional distress". Perez said he planned to donate any money won to the Matthew Shepard foundation, but Judy Shepard, Matthew's mother and head of the foundation, [[pwned]] his cheap attempt at good publicity by saying she wouldn't take his money because [[irony|he used the word "faggot" to incite violence]].[http://thesuperficial.com/2009/06/perez_hiltons_money_refused_by.php]


===LEAVING [[YouTube]] FOREVER!!!===
[[Image:Perezbaww.jpg]]

<youtube>2w57THIhL4k</youtube>

Its about time YouTube started being de-fagged.

===More crap===
[[Image:Perez.jpg|thumb|That's not hot!]]
*Mario was sued by Universal Studios for posting a stolen picture of Jennifer Aniston topless. The picture was supposedly from a scene of Aniston's film, The Breakup, but never made it to the big screen. It was said that Mario "illegally obtained a copy of all or part of the stolen footage."

*[[Lindsay Lohan]]'s ex-girlfriend, Samantha Ronson, sued Perez Hilton for $20 million. This celebrity DJ and bulldyke lesbian is miffed that Perez claimed she was making money by tipping off paparazzi on her ''special friend''. She also takes issue with the site's reports that Ronson was responsible for the cocaine found in LiLo's car the night of her most recent traffic accident.

*Zomba and the [[RIAA|Rape by Instant Anal Assault]] decide they want to sue Perez for [[at least 100|at least 100 million dollars]] for putting 10 of Britney Spears's shitty songs on his shitsite. Now that's a shitload of money. Zomba says it's "[[srs|serious fucking businesses]]" so they are going to take legal action. Can you say [[butthurt]]?

=== Oh lawd, is dat sum [[CP]]? ===
[[File:Miley-cyrus-upskirt.jpg|thumb|right|Censored version of the Tweeted image, if you want the real one, [[Pedophile|your Princess is in another castle.]]]]

{{Quote|I think now it's okay for Miley to be a little sexier because she's almost 18... So it's okay for Miley to show her boobs and expand her horizons.| Perez|stating, in other words, that it's [[awwright]]|color=black|size=200%}}

You might want to have a seat over there for this one: Perez [[twitter|tweeted]] an upskirt shot of [[Miley Cyrus]], who is [[underage|17 years old]]. According to people who know about these sorts of things (i.e. [[Pedobear]]'s lawyer):

{{squote|Jeffrey Douglas, a Los Angeles criminal defense attorney who specializes in child pornography cases, told Salon that Hilton's liability is "extraordinary and intense" and that it was "suicidal for him to do this." He added: "We're not talking about a misdemeanor. You don't have to know what the definition of the law is; all you have to do is knowingly distribute the photograph" -- which Hilton, or someone with access to his Twitter account, most certainly did. It doesn't matter much whether Hilton took the photo, owns the photo or published the photo -- as long as he knowingly distributed the link.|[http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/06/15/miley_cyrus_upskirt/ Salon article]}}.

Even if it's [[shooped]], Perez could still get V&, because, "For instance, if you were to take the face of an 8-year-old and put that picture on the nude body of even an identifiable, fully developed adult porn star, it is child-porn punishable identical to if you took a photo of the actual child." 
Pedo Ray Cyrus is not pressing charges (doesn't want to later be accused of hypocrisy...)
Ironically enough, Perez actually is a pedo, as proved by his constant drooling over Taylor Lautner, Zac Efron and [[Justin Bieber]] and his attempts to copy Lou Pearlman by [http://boybandsearch.com forming and managing a boy band with boys as young as 13 years old] (<b>SPOILER ALERT</b>: This will be added to the list of Mario's ever-expanding list of failures in the near future). The amusing part of all this is that he will probably be getting [[ass rape]]d by Bubba in the slammer for posting a CP pic of an underage girl instead of the little boys he loves so much.

UPDATE:  Billy Ray Cyrus will not be pressing charges.  This is because of two reasons:

1. the man sees nothing wrong with sexploiting his teenage daughter

2. now that Miley is maturing, and losing the [[loli|pubescent]] look, she's just not worth the effort.

OH SNAP.


==Recent fails==
===The faggot who cried bullshit===
[[Image:Perez hilton mariofailsitlols.jpg|center]]

Mere days after the video Perez made about the incident with will.i.am's manager!!!! where Perez claims he didn't need to do [[lie|things for press]]!!!! Perez posted a blog entry claiming that Michael Jackson [[But you are died!|had not died]]!!!! and was simply doing this as a [[For the lulz|stunt]]!!!!! Thus proving he is a [[truth|liar]]!!!!!

Of course, after MJ was actually pronounced dead, the entry changed and Perez acted like he never wrote this (and he didn't...[http://guanabee.com/2009/07/barbara-lavandeira-perez-hilton it was his sister Barbara]). That's right, Perez doesn't write for his own site anymore (except when it involves promoting himself in some capacity), because he's too busy being a self-absorbed douchebag with delusions of grandeur to do so.

===It Gets Better===
<center><youtube>VeEunG9M2s0</youtube></center>
Apart from being an ugly waste of life Perez uploaded a video for the "It gets better" project to raise awareness to the [[Lulz|horrible gay teen suicides]] that have been occuring recently. The irony was lost on Perez. Claiming to be an advocate for anti-bullying he seems to have forgotten that his website is a place dedicated to outing and bullying other people which were the reasons [[Tyler Clementi]] was forced to [[an hero]]. More ironic still, if there's one thing that will drive a gay teen to suicide, it's the realisation that this fat greasy cunt is what people associate with homosexuality.

===Perez Hilton Presents...FAIL!!===
The faggot likes to take random bands from random genres from random countries that no one has ever heard of, and have them tour America. Despite annoying the fuck out of his readers and urging them to buy tickets for months, Perez only managed to attract [[fail|about 250 people a night]]...[[epic fail|these concerts are being held in venues that holds two thousand people]]. Perez has gotten so desperate to get people to see his shit shows that he's now [[pwned|giving tickets away for free]] to some of his upcoming stops. Ida Maria, one of the headliners of the tour, was so pissed off by the turnout that she started [[alcoholic|drinking heavily]] during shows and [http://www.dailyfreepress.com/the-queen-s-not-so-royal-jubilee-1.1881454 quit the tour] during the Boston leg.

Keeping in with Perez's narcissistic nature, almost all of the merchandising for the Perez Hilton Presents Tour are related to Perez himself except for one tiny link to Ida Maria's merchandise located on another site which he removed. Considering Ida Maria isn't even on the tour anymore, that means that Perez isn't selling any merchandise related to any of the bands he is promoting. [[sarcasm|What a good promoter!]] BTW, one of the shirts he is trying to sell has his fucking dog on it. [[Seriously]].[http://perezhiltonpresents.com/merch/]

=== More and more ===

*Perez got into a [[Twatter]] war with Demi Moore over what her [[whore|stripperific]] 15-year-old daughter Tallulah was wearing in a picture that was posted onto his site. Perez threatened to sue Demi for "defamation of character" because she called him a pedo for posting the picture, sparking yet another potentially frivolous [[lolsuit]]. With the advent of the Miley Cyrus upskirt incident (see below), it appears that Demi Moore was right all along and she is now probably laughing her ass off at the faggot's misfortune. 
*[http://cocoperez.com/ CocoPerez] (A name he ripped off of [http://cocoperu.com/ CocoPeru]) is a new fashion site that Perez started to cater to "26-year-old women", [[lies|who supposedly make up a large part of his readerbase]]. [[Fail]]s most notably in the fact that Perez knows absolutely nothing about fashion, as seen by [http://img.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wenn2572940.jpg his] [http://img.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/90754778__oPt.jpg recent] [http://img.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_4316.jpg outfits]. '''WARNING: EYE BLEACH RECOMMENDED AFTER CLICKING THOSE LINKS!!!!''' Being the narcissistic douchebag that he is, Perez probably makes Barbara write for this site, too.
*Perez started his own record label under the totally [[retarded]] name of Perezcious Records. The label has several crap acts: Sliimy, a fag from [[France]] that looks like Prince but has none of the talent; Travis Garland, see below; and [[lesbian|Darelle London]]. Perez (or his ugly sister) would shove this guy down the throats of his annoyed readers for months. When Sliimy's album was finally released, it came as a shock to noone (except Perez) that it was an [[epic fail]]ure.
*Not having learned from his failure with Sliimy, Perez has signed another artist to his shitty label, Travis Garland. Just like with Sliimy, Perez/Barbara is shoving Perez's new object of desire down the throats of his readers. In May 2010, Garland made his debut on [[American Idol]] in a completely failtastic performance. Naturally, Perez was the only one to say anything positive about the performance; [http://perezhilton.com/?p=100306&cp=2#comments all of his readers hated it]. Perez even went as a far as to delete negative comments from blog posts about his newest buttboy, but stopped when the negative comments clearly overwhelmed all three of the positive ones (<b>SPOILER ALERT</b>: Those positive comments were Mario's sockpuppets) and his readers complained en masse about being censored.
*On August 24, 2007 at 3:54 pm, Perez posted on his blog the death of Fidel Castro: "The announcement of Fidel Castro's death will be made at approximately 4:00 P.M. Eastern, PerezHilton.com has just been updated exclusively. To everyone in Miami, please be mindful of each other and keep your safety in mind." Evidently, Fidel was very much alive at that time, managing to rape one more faggot before he actually dies, after Perez made a total ass of himself.
