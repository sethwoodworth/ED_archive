Michael Pousti
'''Michael C. Pousti''' (also known as '''Fanbox.com''' and '''sms.ac'''), whose name (which might be a pseudonym) means [[gay]] in [[Greek]] (not kidding), is one of the people who make the [[Internet]] a truly better place, by using ''your [[name]]'' to send out [[spam|tempting offers]] like:
*"get your [[penis]] surgery for free!"
*"you just won the [[Nigeria]]n state lottery"
*"you just inherited your [[Africa]]n uncle"

Incidentally, his company name "sms.ac" is an anagram of "scams".
