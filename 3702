'''Hey guys whats going on in here''' is a phrase used on [[forum]]s like [[SomethingAwful]] to parody [[n00b]]s.
Usually used when someone with no knowledge of the topic suddenly throws in their opinion or asks a question that was answered fifty replies ago.

Also used by [[newfags|new joiner]] to a [[longcat|long]] thread on [[b|/b/]], which has attained a length long enough that by the time the thread has been fully read it will have deleted, and had probably been [[mantrain|derailed]] from the [[incest|original topic]]. Usually accompanied by [[Slowpoke]] to indicate the slowness of the [[Retarded|reader]] joining in the thread late, and implies a request for a [[Shit nobody cares about|summary of events]] so far.

The expression is also sometimes put on [[lolcats]].
