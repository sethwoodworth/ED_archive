Alt.tasteless
Long before there was a [[b/|/b/]], long before there was an [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]], long
before there was internets, long before anyone reading ED was born,
[[basement-dweller|Internet users]] would gather on [[Usenet]] to swap
computer support tips, [[furry|erotic stories]], recipes, [[shit nobody cares about|political
opinions]], [[loli|and other bulletin-board material]]. '''alt.tasteless''' was the [[b/|/b/]] of Usenet, a group
inhabited by self-declared [[pedophiles]], [[BDSM]] freaks, [[scat]]
enthusiasts, IRL [[guro]] aficionados, medical fetishists, and other [[sick fuck|upstanding members of the Internet community]].  As one [[troll|contemporary]] described it:

<blockquote> It's unbelievable the filth they talk about on that group! Mostly about taking [[scat|big shits]], like that's something to be proud of, right?  Then some lady was talking about stretching out her boyfriends testicles as a form of sex play. Plus a lot of articles involving murder crimes and substance abuse. [[Gay]] men [[whore|offering themselves for sex]]. They also were discussing what would be worse, getting hit in the face with a [[I has a shuvel|shovel]] or getting a cactus stuffed up your [[butthurt|behind]].

Chronic alt.tasteless users were usually not the [[basement dweller]] type one may find on /b/, since most of the prolific posters had already established themselves prior to [[eternal September]] and the invasion of [[AOL|Assholes On Line]].  Often, they were college students, Bastard Operators From Hell, and computer programmers or system analysts.  

==Regular Posters==

*'''Constantino Tobio, Jr.''', a.k.a. "Trashcan Man" was a history major at Columbia with a curious fear of [[Australia|vegemite]], one of alt.tasteless' Holy Sacraments along with the [[turd|Grogan]].  Trashcan Man's role in the alt. tasteless invasion of rec.pets.cats was detailed in the Wired article cited below, to the great consternation of other a.t'ers who naturally felt that Trashcan Man was a newbie upstart who got lucky by getting his name in print.

*'''[[Your Email/Geoff Miller's Epic Flame|Geoff Miller]]''', a systems analyst at Sun Microsystems who loved to flame the shit out of newbies whom he did not deem tasteless enough.  He frequently scoffed at those he'd offended, especially when they threatened to rat him out to his ISP.  [[Epic win|He clearly explained that his ISP had a hands-off policy with regard to user activity, and that even if they did revoke his service, there were many other service providers who would gladly take his money.]]  Note, young man, that this was in the days of yore when there were literally thousands of ISP's available.

*'''Robert/Roberta Hatch''' whose .sig proclaimed allegiance to "Dykes on Bikes" of San Francisco, Calif. was the resident [[trap]] on a.t.  Since s/h/it posted about menstrual blood clots and vaginal secretions that heretofore had never been described on the net in such exacting detail, it was possible to suspend disbelief that he was, in fact, a [[sick fuck|sick]], sick man.

*'''Tae Hyong Kim''', the paramedic with a heart of coal, who would dialup alt.tasteless after work in order to make fun of the patients he had taken care of that day.  He especially relished relaying information about stupid deaths and [[suicide]]s, and was quite possibly one of the inspirations for the [[Darwin Awards]].

*'''PRED''', a self-proclaimed IRL [[sick fuck|sexual predator]] and [[pedobear|pedophile]]. Author of the "Lolita Method", a guide for [[Party Van|seducing underage girls]], numerous [[guro]] stories, and a number of [[epic|highly racist and misogynistic]] essays, namely [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tasteless/msg/e2a88d7fbb35294f?dmode=source] and [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.sex.stories.d/msg/ed7f8fbac1a93e52?dmode=source]. Disappeared from the Internet [[at least 100|years ago]], [[allegedly|presumably]] in prison. [http://offender.fdle.state.fl.us/offender/flyer.do?personId=21486]

*'''Hollister''', a militant [[faggot]] who described the joys of fucking men bareback [[in the ass]] in the age of [[GRIDS]].  He enjoyed water sports, drugs, and alcohol, and often woke up soaked in another man's piss.
 
In 1993, alt.tasteless members orchestrated one of the first forum invasions, in which [[pwned|rec.pets.cats]] (a newsgroup for [[cat|cat]]-lovers) was mercilessly trolled. The thread is archived by teh [[Google]] here: [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tasteless/browse_thread/thread/3f265cf9ef49d3e1]. The thread was an [[epic]] win to the extent that the [[butthurt]] members of r.p.c. [[drama|conspired]] to get the original posters b& from the Internet.

[[Shit|Scatological themes]] are heavily discussed on alt.tasteless, some [[epic|famous]] threads include stories of diarrhea [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tasteless/msg/adc23a36dc3c70cb], constipation [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tasteless/msg/1d24fcf0c8ac049e], extreme constipation
[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tasteless/msg/d533d90e262bd868], sewage plants [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tasteless/msg/821e5f64f3e29e6e], shitting one's self
[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tasteless/msg/bfd7fc5a8160de21], anal surgery
