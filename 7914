'''Superdickery''' is a website of unaltered comic book covers and panels that could... um... [[subtext|be misinterpreted]].  It is thought by many that the comic book industry has always covertly encouraged [[slashfic]].  Here is the [[sauce|proof]].  Its original purpose was to showcase that [[Superman]] is a [[dick]].  Now that this has been proven, its new purpose is to prove that all superheroes are [[teh]] [[gay]], Wonder Woman is severely into [[BDSM]] and that Jimmy Olsen is a [[gorillasexual]].

== Origin Story ==

It all started with a thread on [[Allspark]]. A member who shall remain nameless (Mike Miksch) posted some old [[Superman]] comic covers. After much discussion over America's favorite superhero, the members of the forum came to the conclussion that Superman was a [[penis|dick]].

This makes sense, of course. Growing up superpowered, who would have dared to try to displine him? It makes sense that he would end up like that one kid from the Twilight Zone. Plus, his [[girlfriend]] is a [[bitch]], his best friend betrays him all the time[http://www.superdickery.com/other/92.html], and he's surrounded by people too stupid to realize he's just Clark Kent without the glasses. You'd be a dick sometimes too.

==Site today==
Same as the site yesterday. It used to be updated monthly, then bimonthly, then whenever he felt like it. Finally, the site creator just gave up, and it's never updated anymore. In fact, you're likely to catch a virus from the site if you have a [[I GOT NORTON!|shit antivirus program]]. Plus, all the links are switched around, so for example, http://www.superdickery.com/dick/1.html is now http://superdickery.com/index.php?view=article&catid=28%3Asuperdickery&id=1%3Asuperman-vs-pat-boone&option=com_content&Itemid=24.
