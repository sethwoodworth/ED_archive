Must Be Pop
'''Must Be Pop''' is a [[LiveJournal]]-based [[roleplaying]] game filled with massive [[trolling]] potential. In the game, hordes of [[sixteen-year-old]] dullards converge and pretend to be interesting celebrities whom they then make [[gay]]. This is so that these hideous beasts can provide a great reason for why [[emo|Pete Wentz]] was totally not interested in sleeping with them after the [[shit band|Fall Out Boy]] concert.


== Playing Must Be Pop ==

[[Image:Ronhoward.jpg|thumb|A typical MBP user]] Playing is easy.  Log onto [http://mustbepop.darkcafedays.com/newbie.html their website] and create a “character” by using a celebrity’s name.  Make a bunch of icons of your celebrity with the forehead cropped to the eyebrows, and then spend every waking minute on LiveJournal pretending that you’re Ron Howard trapped in a perpetual electronic junior high school, and that this makes you important.

== Winning Must Be Pop ==

*Contact a player and pretend to be “their” celebrity or a legal representative.  

*Create a character with obvious connections to other players in the game, e.g. bandmates, co-stars, etc. Refuse to have any contact with these people.

*Create a role and then do absolutely nothing so no one else can enjoy it.

*Make a journal for  [http://ewans-package.livejournal.com/ someone's dong]

*Stir up as much shit as possible.  Post publicly stating that you are “erasing that storyline” and that the last three weeks never happened. 

*Many players put their fake celebrity AIM SN’s up on their LiveJournal profile.  Use this to your advantage. 

*Make up a bunch of shit about other players and post it without clearing it with them first.  If you write a long entry about how “you” and “Parker Posey” shot up and gang-banged the members of N Sync, it automatically becomes canon.  And there’s not a damn thing they can do about it. 

*Have outlandish things happen to your character with no regard for reality or continuity.  Nobody will think twice if you have your character breaks his rib during a sexual act and then appear that night in concert, unscathed. If they're an internationally-known top supermodel, write a post about having your lover shave your legs, or how you dye your hair from the Clairol box and why you don’t believe in diets...since in reality, you weigh 400 pounds and live in your parents' basement.

*Take a virtually unknown celebrity and use them to work on your own crippling psychoses.  A cartoonist that nobody has ever heard of can, conceivably, rape his A-list actress fiancee and everyone else will just have to go with that.

*Write letters to [[Jodie Foster]].

== Leaving The Game ==

After “Tom Waits” and “Dan Rather” get into their lovers spat, one of them will go into the public forum and announce that “he” is leaving forever.  Goodbye, cruel fake world.  Nobody will be sure whether the post is intended to be in-character or out-of-character, including the author, because at this point, each roleplayer has assumed that they have a psychic link with whomever they play.  Note that it is technically impossible to ever leave MBP.
