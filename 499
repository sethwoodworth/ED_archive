The '''''Animaniacs''''' are typical [[Rule 34]] fare, and are a frequently [[WWOEC|raped section of your childhood]]. They are all over [[WWOEC]] and are a particular favorite of a certain [[pedophile|artist]] by the name of [[WWOEC|8HORNS]]. This [[basement dweller]] believes that the only thing the [[internets]] needs is obnoxiously cute [[incest]] [[ameriloli]] [[pron]] of the '''Yakko, Wakko, and Dot'''. Often times they are paired off with fellow [[rape]]d childhood fair, ''[[WWOEC|Tiny Toons]]''. The worst part: Fans of the show cannot deny that this sadly makes sense.

==Origins in your Childhood==

''Animaniacs'' was one of the most insane and [[awesome]] American cartoons ever made. It was the last place to properly and frequently use the [[Last Thursday|medieval]] tool, the anvil, in it proper form: dropping it on people to make them flat, [[pedophile|like twelve-year-old girl]] flat. The show involved declaring to children that Elvis was still alive, that [[sick fucks|mimes]] should be hated and killed, and explicitly stated that the main characters had the ability to bend the space time continuum and [[divide by zero]].  Basically, it was [[Family Guy|a show that ate and shat pop culture references]] but was made to be fully digested by 8-14 year-olds. Amazing really. Also, Yakko could name every country, even that one with [[niggas]]. As one [[/b/tard]] stated: "The show is like /b/, but with less rule 34." It is likely this statement that lead to the [[Rule 34|raping of your childhood]] that follows.

Sadly, given that the characters were covered in fur, the show, like countless others before it, attracted hordes of [[furries]] like [[Semen|white on rice]]. The very nature of furries causes them to [[Sonic|ruin everything they come across]], and ''Animaniacs'' was not an exception. Just as they have done with Disney's ''Robin Hood'', ''Starfox'', and ''[[Pokemon]]'', the furfags proceeded to destroy everything wonderful about the show. The only good thing to come out of the mess was another reason to nuke [[Anthrocon]].

==Dot==
Most, but not all, of the childhood [[rape]] around ''Animaniacs'' centers around the female and youngest Warner Sibling, '''Dot'''. Believe it or not, this is still actually more bearable than the ones without her, which consist of [[ameriloli|amerishota]] between '''Yakko''' and '''Wakko''', which makes ''[[Rule 34|Calvin and Hobbes]]'' look down right decent.

===8HORNS===

If there has ever been one [[pedophile]] most responsible for the [[rape]] of a single childhood memory, its [[8HORNS]] of Dot. This [[fucktard]] has actually been drawn in other [[fucktard]]s' art taking Dot from behind, this the level of [[sick fuck]] that he has reached. The worst part: he's a decent artist. Most of his work is on model, and tortuously cute. Also, [[at least 100|pretty much 100]] % of other [[WWOEC|Ameriloli Pedophiles]] drawing Dot are actually drawing a gift for this fucker. We can only hope that an asteroid will land on him soon.
Of course, we prefer a bullet instead.

==Wakko and The Hammer==
Actions speak louder than rules, and images are easier to read than either of those. Post "Rule 34 on ''Animaniacs''" on [[/b/]] and some [[sick fuck]] will probably pull the pic of Wakko sticking a hammer up his ass and cumming wildly. It will [[300|make you cry]].

==Cock Teases==

One of the biggest reasons people watch this show is for the occasional tits. Namely Hello Nurse and Minerva Mink.

==Gods?==

Yesterday, [[User:Epocalypse|some stupid fuck]] was trying to push off the idea that the Warner Brothers and the Warner Sister were the true [[God]]s of the universe. However, this was a massive [[fail]] as it had nothing to do with the [[internets]] and the [[fucktard]] [[Basement Dweller]] made himself [[An Hero]], and was consequently [[Jesus|Crucified]].
