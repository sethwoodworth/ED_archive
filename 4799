Lego Robot Comics
<!--
*nice wikipedian editor notes you faggot -->

The [[Internet]], a hive of [[Star Trek|Infinite diversity, in infinite combinations]], being what it is has spawned many cultural adaptations to reality, chief among these is the [[webcomic]].

as with all such things, there are bound to be leaders, and followers, in this case a very shitty follower.

This follower in particular is named "lego robot comics" which is of course an indicator of its uninhibited retardation. It is a cheap knock off of [[Electric_Retard|Electric Retard]], only with [[gay|family friendly]] humor and a dedicated following of [[retard|retarded]] [[user:MercWithMouth|12 year olds]], who think its the greatest thing ever because its humor isn't good enough to be caught by their parents content filter. The author of Lego Robot Comics, [[Bob Averill]], was permabanned from SomethingAwful for pedophilia.

== Overview ==

The typical strip starts off with an [[unfunny]] exposition frame, followed shortly by the introduction of whatever shitty [[meme]] was posted on [[4chan]] the morning before, and continues for 12 frames to many trying to prove itself as funny, and naturaly fails in the process. The art, unlike [[Electric Retard]]'s is unintentionally funny. Being of the lowest calibre imagineable, as is natural considering the only combination of [[forced meme]]s and mspaint can be [[fail|failure]].

This is all of course [[moot]] as legorobotcomics only has a small handful of viewers dispite trying desperately to appeal to a large audience by using shitty [[chan]] [[meme|memes]]. Though this is somewhat surprising given the average modern [[chanfag|chanfags]] penchant for lame jokes and trying too hard. If someone shows you this website, and tells you it is funny, it is likely this person is either a [[troll]], or a loser. It's very name is exempliary of all that is wrong with the internet, containing the average toy of retarded 12 year olds, a robot LoL RaNdOm, and comic, implying there is something to be read, when there isnt.
