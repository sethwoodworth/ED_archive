James L. Grant
James L. Grant, known as {{ljuser|flemco}} on [[LiveJournal]] is a self-proclaimed [[Long-winded people|writer]], known for creating two [[redundant|shit]] [[webcomic|webcomics]] known as ''[http://www.flemcomics.com/ FLEM]'' and ''[http://www.twolumps.net Two Lumps]'', the latter he makes with his [[Space_Moose|non-existent wife]]. [[Image:JamesLGrant sosobald.jpg|thumb|Not only is he bald, but he is also pig-like in appearance.]]

Grant first came to prominence after posting a rant in his LiveJournal about how much he hates [[You|NaNoWriMo]]. 

==The Post==

The original LJ post was a rant about how NaNoWriMo offends Grant as a [[retard|Serious Writer]] due to NaNoWriMo's promotion of [[bullshit|recreational writing]] by [[emo|normal people]]. Naturally, it was populated with [[ALL CAPS|CAPSLOCK]], '''bold text''' and several pictures of crying children that Grant had recently [[rape|raped]] for what was apparently supposed to be humorous emphasis, but remained ultimately [[unfunny]] since Grant can't even [[troll]] properly (see below). [[Image:Crybaby.png|thumb|You'd be crying too if an [[Internet Tough Guy]] was using your image on the internet for [[unfunny]] purposes.]]

==The Response==

Some [[13_year_old_boy|upstanding Intarwebz denizen]] was [[butthurt]] by Grant's rant, and responded in turn with a daring rebuttal. Some other [[fag|defender of the glory that is NaNoWriMo]] thought this comment was filled with [[epic]] [[win]], and then came to ED to [[Unwarranted_self_importance|tell the internets all about how cool it was]] for [[pwn]]ing some guy who does shitty webcomics. Obviously James L. Grant is a [[Pedobear|bad bad man]]. [[Image:JamesLGrant_guns.jpg|thumb|James L. Grant, Internet Tough Guy.]]

==The Drama==

After Grant realized that his black person was being soiled, he attempted to alleviate his [[butthurt]] by [http://community.livejournal.com/metaquotes/6372888.html?thread=121313048 pseudo]-[http://community.livejournal.com/metaquotes/6372888.html?thread=121321752 trolling] anyone [http://community.livejournal.com/metaquotes/6372888.html?thread=121365784 who] [http://community.livejournal.com/metaquotes/6372888.html?thread=121306648 dared] to [http://community.livejournal.com/metaquotes/6372888.html?thread=121351448 cross] him, not to mention banning anyone who [http://flemco.livejournal.com/1973838.html?thread=25094478#t25094478 commented on this] on his OWN JOURNAL GOD FORBID!!!11!! [[Lulz]] ensued. In turn, [[emo|noble NaNoWriMo participants]] from far and wide flocked to ED to [[butthurt|mock and flame]] Grant for [[irony|treating their harmless recreation as SRS BZNS.]]

==[[Shit_nobody_cares_about|The Central Question]]==

Who will win in the epic contest of [[buttsex|mutual butthurt]] between pro- and anti-NaNoWriMo factions?

==Possible Outcome==

Both factions continue to act like idiots until they both disappear in the wake of a huge shitstorm. Alternatively, they cease giving a shit and return to their [[Basement-dweller|normal lives]].
