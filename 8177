'''The Domino's Youtube Incident''' took place in the middle of April in [[2009]] when two [[old|thirty-something]] employees of a Conover, [[North Carolina]] [[shit|Domino's Pizza]], 31-year-old Kristy Hammonds and 32-year-old Michael Setzer, thought it would be a [[no|bright idea]] to record themselves sticking some [[cheese]] up Michael's nose and [[fart]]ing on the food. The video shortly found its way onto [[YouTube]]. 

Due to the massive outrage by [[moralfag]] YouTubers, disgusted in the same way that they were with the [[Kenny Glenn]] incident, a massive number of complaints to both YouTube and Domino's were received, and the story made its way onto [[Twitter]] as well and then was covered in the media. Furthermore with YouTube being the [[censorship]] faggots that they are, they removed the video, so [[LiveLeak]] got the upper hand on hosting the video.

{{quote|“In about five minutes it’ll be sent out on delivery where somebody will be eating these, yes, eating them, and little did they know that cheese was in his nose and that there was some lethal gas that ended up on their salami. Now that’s how we roll at Domino’s.”|[[Krystal Can't Enjoy Her Sandwich|Kristy]]}}


==Domino's Responds==
Domino's quickly went into immediate [[disregard that|damage control]] mode and the employees were promptly [[pwnt|fired, sued, and charged with criminal acts]]. The CEO of Domino's appeared on YouTube and Dominoes created [http://twitter.com/dpzinfo an official twitter account], although the rhyme or reason behind the last is somewhat elusive seeing as that's about as ineffectual as bailing out the motherfucking ocean.

The kicker is that the [[obesity|fat fucks]] who like to [[om nom nom|gobble down]] Dominoes gross pizzas every day will probably not flinch for a second and continue to eat all of Dominoes low-quality [[dogshit]] products regardless of whether snot, blood, ass, or semen has touched their good ol' American coronary inducing goodness.
