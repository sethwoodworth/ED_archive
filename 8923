Wat do
[[Image:PhilosoraptorWatDo.jpg|thumb|In a quandary, Philosoraptor tackles the age old question.]]
'''Wat do''' is the greatest philosophical question of our time. The great wide [[Internets]] is riddled with tormented, brooding individuals whose lives are nothing more than an endless stumble from one tragic-comic situation to the next. When faced with an impossible fork in the road, with multiple choices and none of them being easy, it's easy to see how one would begin to ask himself... 

{{quote|''wat do?''}}

Without a doubt, one of these [[philosopher]] types will come upon a situation that is so confounding that it can only be dealt with in one way: stopping immediately, finding the nearest computer and typing out a staccato, abrupt description of the scenario and ending it with '''Wat do'''. The most obvious choice would be to post it on [[4chan]], in particular on [[/b/]], thereby placing this most urgent situation in their empathetic hands.


==Origins==

'''Wat do''' floated to the top of the [[shit]]-clogged cesspool of /[[b]]/ sometime around Spring to Summer 2009. The exact date cannot be determined at this time, because browsing there is akin to losing oneself in a haze in which space, time and [[Moralfag|morality]] do not exist.

===Grammatical note===

[[Image:Watdo2.JPG|thumb|[[Ronery]] nerds using ''Wat do'' and [[Masturbation|stroking cock]], as usual.]] ''[[Wat]]'' appears to bear some resemblance to the spelling and function of the English word ''what''. On the [[Internets]], it's considered [[anti-lulz]] to write anything more than a 2 to 3 word combination of abbreviations and slang. Therefore, the entire phrase reaches max [[lulz]] by being only 2 words long, having the first word misspelled and awkward as fuck and getting right to the verb, which is often the point of most sentences anyway.

As surprising as it may seem, the letters can actually be [[You are doing it wrong|done wrong]]. For more on this, read [[Wat do#Doing it Wrong|below]].

===Current Status===

'''Wat do''' continues to linger on [[4chan]] like the smell of [[alcohol|beer]] farts in [[your mom]]'s car seat cushions. It spread its whore legs and was [[rape|penetrated]]
in several other forums, including [[SomethingAwful]], several other *chan sites and [[Ebaumsworld]]. 

==Uses==

Here is a small sampling of the '''Wat do''' in action.

==[[Doing It Wrong]]==

Do not, under any circumstance, say "What do?". That is dreadful; it's worse than participating in a [[furpile]]. Do not expand it into a longer phrase, such as "What do I do?" or "What do now?" or "What must be done?". It's the same as [[Your a fucking idiot|"Your a fucking idiot"]]. If [[you]] catch someone doing it wrong, it's important to [[sage]]bomb the thread on [[4chan]] to make sure it doesn't [[bump]] back toward the front page and instead vanishes into oblivion as soon as possible. On any other site that you encounter a poorly executed '''Wat do''', troll them and point out their [[newfag]] nature. It is possible that it might be a [[troll]] that finds it amusing to write popular [[memes]] wrong and then watch everyone get [[butthurt]] and correct them; as [[Star Wars|Yoda]] would say in this circumstance, "Correct at own risk, you will; in case [[trolled]] [[newfag]] may be [[you]]".
