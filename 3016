The '''food pyramids''' were first built by the [[Egypt|Egyptians]] and even though they had 4 sides, they had six parts:
# [[Fat|Fats, Oils and Sweets]]
# [[Cum|Milk, Yogurt and Cheese]]
# [[Cock|Meat]]
# [[Terri Schiavo|Vegetable]]
# [[Homosexual|Fruit]]
# [[Money|Bread]]



The food pyramid varies in many areas of the world.  In fact, [[Jewish]] food pyramids often contain far lot less [[pork]] and far more fish.  This explains why they may be good with numbers, but not in the sack.  In fact, recent studies have shown that more pork = more [[sex]].  Then again, a rise in pork consumption may also lead to more [[fat people]] and/or more death by [[Swine influenza|H1N1 Influenza Type A]]  This is why we need the food pyramid.

[[Merrill Howard Kalin|Many people]] feel more sexually aroused by pyramids, and often, fat people will feel more sexually aroused by [[food]].  Unattended food may lead to wild fatty infestations.
