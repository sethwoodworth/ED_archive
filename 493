[[Image:Ad stfu.jpg|thumb|Frustration sets in.]]
{{lj|animal_dreams}}, also known as "Kelly," was a [[LiveJournal]] user who posted frequently on [[stupid free]] and [[brutal honesty]]. She founded the community {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} for users of {{ljcomm|stupid_free}} to violate LJ's TOS, [[comment whore]], and post [[n00dz]]. Members of her new community licked her clit at every opportunity, inflating the normal sense of [[unwarranted self-importance]] usually observed among {{ljcomm|brutal_honesty}} and S_F members to epic levels.

The rumors began in August of 2007: allegedly, Kelly had slept with [[Mengus]], a popular B_H manwhore. Users of [[LJ User Secrets]] posted repeatedly about it, trying to get to the truth of the matter while engaged in an ongoing catfight over who had the right to Mengus's dick. Kelly herself remained coy:

{{quote|I feel like I shouldn't show favoritism as a mod, but I think it goes without saying that mengus is my favorite person in any community.|Kelly, [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3447.html still in the honeymoon stage]}}

==The revelation==
In October of 2007, Kelly posted to {{ljcomm|brutal_honesty}} and {{ljcomm|brutal_drama}}, revealing explicit details of the sordid affair in a seedy motel. 

{{quote|Not ten minutes after we walk in the door, he is fucking me over the desk. He finishes in a few minutes, much to my relief -- my calves are cramping from standing on tip-toe. "Oooops" I hear him say from behind me. Apparently period sex + half-dressed sex is not a good combination. His wifebeater is soaked with blood at the bottom, and I have big bloody handprints all over my ass and the back of my shirt.|animal_dreams, whose biological functions appear to be a mystery to her}}

A true gentleman, he buys her lunch at Chili's and deigns to return again two weeks later, to stick it in her pooper. Alas, true love was not to be, and Kelly watched as Mengus flirted with and fucked every bitch who shook her tail at him on LJ.

Furious at being cast aside, she fell back on the standard psychological warfare tactic of women scorned: [http://ljusersecrets.suckafree.ws/?p=172 the pregnancy scare].

{{quote|I did get a positive urine test. Took two: one negative, one positive. But the blood test was negative.|animal_dreams, still having trouble with her organs}}

Unfortunately for her, when she went weeping to Mengus about it, he laughed in her e-face and informed her that [http://ljusersecrets.suckafree.ws/?p=144 he had had a vasectomy]. B_H exploded in lulz, and she [[Deleting your LiveJournal|deleted her account]].

==Consequences? What consequences?==
Shortly afterward, she returned in order to [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/120609.html resign as moderator] of {{ljcomm|sf_drama}}, explaining that she would now be a normal, average, totally sane community member. For the next month or so, she continued to post in B_H, S_F, and SF_D as if absolutely nothing had happened, even though everybody was far more acquainted with her sex life and bodily functions than they had ever wished to be.

Mengus, having unwisely stuck his dick in the crazy, only made matters worse by continuing to correspond with Kelly throughout the entire ordeal. His responses to her emails and phone calls provided her with the attention she so desperately craved, as any [[stalker|stalking]] victim with half a brain could have told him, but then thinking with the brain had never been his strong suit. He even allowed her to re-friend his LJ again [http://ljusersecrets.suckafree.ws/?p=362 under a fake name] so no one would know he hadn't dumped her yet. While it is doubtful that he had any plans to fuck her again, observers note that Mengus has never been able to give up attention when it's right there for the taking.

==Deletion, again==
Then, abruptly, Kelly posted a [http://community.livejournal.com/deleting_my_lj/38504.html flounce] in {{ljcomm|deleting_my_lj}} and dropped out of sight once more. LJUS users celebrated with another spate of boring "what's going on?" posts.

It turned out that Kelly, apparently, was in the process of [[Batshit insane|losing her shit]]. Unwilling to give up her audience entirely, she started a Blogger account and then set up a [http://syndicated.livejournal.com/animal_dreaming/ syndicated feed on LiveJournal], making sure that no one would lack for information about her [http://syndicated.livejournal.com/animal_dreaming/11484.html self-injury], her thrilling efforts to get a doctor's appointment, and her eventual [http://syndicated.livejournal.com/animal_dreaming/14809.html semi-hospitalization].

==The final straw==
After all of this, of course, she restored her LJ account and came back as if nothing were wrong. Finally, sick of having to listen to this shit from both sides, [[qweerdo]] posted an email from Kelly to Mengus that the latter had forwarded to him:

[[Image:Kelly_email.png|center]]

'''tl;dr:''' She was never pregnant, she didn't go crazy (at least not in the way she claimed), she posted all of the secrets on LJUS, and Mengus is a monster in bed. All of the people from SF_D and elsewhere who had defended Kelly and characterized Mengus as the next best thing to a rapist shut up ''real'' fast.

==Aftermath==
Kelly attempted, belatedly, to use the [[I did it for the lulz]] defense, but by that time, even the most credulous LJ user had a hard time believing her.

[http://ljusersecrets.suckafree.ws/?p=653 I never liked any of you and I'm a huge liar, so you're the ones who should feel bad.]

Kelly deleted her LJ account for the third and probably last time, and instead turned to [http://ljusersecrets.suckafree.ws/?p=675 insulting her former friends anonymously]. Mengus, finally realizing what the rest of LJ had known for [[at least 100 years]], got a [http://ljusersecrets.suckafree.ws/?p=735 restraining order] against Kelly, and everyone learned a valuable lesson about not fucking people you meet on the Internets.

==THE RETURN==
On July 3rd, 2008, {{lj|corrodentia}} posted a link to an article about [[alpha male]]s with the text "Sound like anyone you know?"

Half the users [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1158213.html recognized her immediately], while the other half -- having missed out on Kelly's glory days -- were left in the dark. For those who knew her, however, the inevitable [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1160321.html IP match] was entirely unnecessary.

[[Some argue]]d that this sort of thing was only encouraging this behavior, and that it's mean to pick on someone with a serious mental illness. Others who remembered the events in this article contended that all Kelly socks should be exposed as such at once, in order to prevent innocent users from being drawn into her psychotic little world.

Meanwhile, {{lj|glitterglass}} decided to divert attention to herself by [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/1158213.html?thread=112986693&style=mine#t112986693 insulting a mod for her failed marriage], leading the LJ Ethics Police to conclude that dragging someone's private business into an argument for no reason is morally equivalent for exposing a vicious, manipulative liar for the dangerous bitch she is.
