[[Image:Xerxes.jpeg|thumb|400px|[[TOW]] admin [[wikipedia:User:Hu12|Hu12]] on ED]]

The '''Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Encyclopedia Dramatica''' is a hoary old [[TOW]] classic. It is an annual ritual for butthurt [[Wikipedos]] to [[BAW|cry a river]] over the fact that ED routinely exposes the fact that TOW employs pedophiles ([[Erik Möller]]) and convicted felons ([[Carolyn Doran]]) to run Jimbo's empire of information control. The amount of bawing is the leading cause of [[Global Warming]] due to the massive amount of [[bullshit|methane gas]] that is emitted during the [[AfD]] [[flame war]]ing that inevitably ensues.

==Modus Operandi==
[[Image:ED_vs_Uncy_Alexa_Rankings.png|thumb|300px|ED vs Uncy? [[pwnt|TKO.]]]]

===Logic===
Encyclopedia Dramatica is a popular website that has existed on the Internets for over 4 years and has been [[ED:PRESS|referenced multiple times]] in a variety of media. It also has a higher [[Alexa]] ranking than similar sites that Wikipedia covers, like (Wikia owned) [[Uncyclopedia]].

===The Draft===
A Wikipedian starts a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Shii/ED&direction=next&oldid=198202452 subpage] stub on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] (or [[Encyclopædia Dramatica]]) and the [[Sceptre|usual suspects]] dogpile on the poor user (or [[Shii|admin]]) and attempt to get the subpage deleted.

===The Article===
However, on occasion, a hero will arise and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by moving the article into 'circulation' as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica bona fide article] whilst the faggotry rages over the subpage.

===The Obligatory Automatic [[AfD]]===
[[Image:TOW_bias.png|thumb|center|800px|[[Sceptre]] voices his [[Butthurt|concerns]] regarding [[TOW]]'s [[NPOV]] [[policy]].]]

===Page Locked Down===
Pending any actual decision on the fate of the article, the page gets locked from everyone, (including 'trusted users') by a [[bureaucratic fuck|TOW admin]] so [[noone]] can alter it...for example [[raidfags]] from [http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Encyclopedia_Dramatica_%28Website%29#ED_has_a_wikipedia_article Uncyclopedia].

===[[Flame|The 'Debate']]===

This is where the real [[lulz]] start.

'''Delete''' - judging by the sources currently available, while it's a long list it's a very shallow one. I don't feel the current selection of sources is enough to establish notability, and the large focus ED has on Wikipedia makes it seem too much like naval-gazing on our part when wikipedia doesn't even care what EDiots think. --[[wikipedia:User:InksPlotch|InkSplotch]] (talk) 20:57, 15 May 2008 (UTC)

*Large focus? According to their own category page, the two specific-to-Wiki categories contain 402 pages. The [[4chan]] category contains 518. [[DeviantART]] has 419. [[Furries]] has 508. [[Memes]] 563. There are 2192 pages in the [[People]] category, some of which may be about Wikipedia editors, but definitely not all of them. So your argument of how ED's "large focus" on Wikipedia equating to "navel-gazing" is ignorant and utterly wrong. [[wikipedia:User:Howa0082|Howa0082]] (talk) 21:08, 15 May 2008 (UTC)

**Category "[[Faggotry]]" has 560. --[[User:Hu12|Hu12]] (talk) 21:29, 15 May 2008 (UTC)

***That category could use some expansion. [[wikipedia:User:Celarnor|Celarnor]] Talk to me 21:33, 15 May 2008 (UTC)

****'''So this is a hobbyist website concerning the making of stick bundles? I confess that through my keep arguments, I've never been to the site...but I do like stick bundles...perhaps after work I shall take a gander'''. --[[wikipedia:User:Smashville|SmashvilleBONK!]] 21:44, 15 May 2008 (UTC)

*'''Question''': Is this the longest AfD evar? Also, I think it (and the history of ED's AFDs) is notable enough for its own article.

{{tinyquote|[[all caps|DELETE]] Must I explain to you exactly how this site [[rape|sexually humiliates]] our editors? I did not want to post here with the [[EDiots|terrorist sympathizers]], but you forced my hand. Many of their latest articles attack our [[:Image:DMandSO.jpg|admin corp]]. I won't link to it because as of right now it is lesser known, since no one really reads ED anymore because they have realised that doing so aligns them with cyberterrorists. Does that make you feel good? Aiding and abetting sexual humiliation and [[cyber bully|cyber stalking]]? Or are you under the impression that a free encyclopedia just builds itself, regardless of whether or not we have editors? I am part of the [[faggots|silent majority]] and our voice [[HAHAHA|will be heard]]. If that offends you in some way, I suggest you take a deep look into your soul and find out if you have any empathy for another living, breathing human being. Are you one of these [[liberal|"free speech" nutcases]] that thinks it is ok to [[scat|deface the Virgin Mary with excrement]] or something? Because that is what Encyclopedia Dramatica amounts to.|The Voice Of Your Heart (talk) 01:33, 15 May 2008 (UTC)}}

**{{tinyquote|Sorry, you're calling people who write for that site TERRORISTS? If you present a reasonable rationale for the removal of an article, ED will take it down. I am, actually, one of those "[[liberal|free speech nutcases]]" that believes people have the right to say what they will without [[fundies|religious fanatics]] like yourself telling me I'm a hateful sinner for not believing in Jesus and behaving like a "[[true Believer|good Christian]]."

{{tinyquote|Keep While my personal opinion on this particular website is that it could just as well be blasted to kingdom come (I would not mind to be the one to pull the trigger), it doesnt change the fact that it seems to have received sufficient media coverage to comply to [[Wikipedia:WEB|WP:Web]]. In each and every case deleting this article would meet delete consensus, this consensus would then apply to a major share of the websites that i have allowed to excist either on the fact that they may or seem to be notable, or because there is not enough reason to press a delete. Also, a lot of the DELETE editors seem to take personal offence from the website, which makes it slightly an [[Wikipedia:WP:IHATEIT|WP:IHATEIT]] topic.| Excirial (Talk,Contribs) 08:04, 16 May 2008 (UTC)}}

[[Image:ED vs Wikipedia.jpg|thumb]]

{{tinyquote|You fuckers got me out of retirement for this vote. Keep just because we hate something doesnt mean we delete it. Else we'd not have Hitler or Dahmer articles (yes thats right I [[Godwin's Law|Godwinned]] this bitch). Trivial coverage in one source ok i'd buy that argument if that was the only source... but trivial coverage in 15 sources, and an in depth article or two from a few is more than sufficient bar to pass for notability purposes. Find me non trivial coverage of the president of Lesotho oh wait you cant do that either... Seriously way to [[fail|ruin any potential historical use of this site in 50 years]]. This is the shit that made me leave.|ALKIVAR™ ☢ 18:02, 15 May 2008 (UTC)}}

{{tinyquote|Keep - I've found plenty of articles on topics that I'd imagine [[Shit nobody cares about|70+% of the human population wouldn't even care about]], and most of them can be found via Random Article. If we have an article on Burford Bulldogs (whose only source leads to a 404 error), then why can't we have an article on ED? Honestly, this bad blood most wikipedos have towards ED is ridiculous. I spend a lot of time reading and editing BOTH ED and Wikipedia. After reading the articles on ED about Wikipedia's [[LaraLove|dark]], [[FCYTravis|disgusting]], and rather [[Sceptre|shady depths]], I became quite disillusioned and decided to avoid dealing with anything major on Wikipedia beyond simple spelling fixes and the like, but it's things like this AfD nomination that make me crawl out of hiding and wield my logichammer. In rebuttal to the lack of sources (the only valid delete argument I see here), I direct everyone to that Burford Bulldogs stub, which has only ONE source link which is broken. If ED goes, then so should that stub and others like it. Fucking ridiculous.|InvaderJim42  23:33, 15 May 2008 (UTC)}}

{{tinyquote|Keep. This is [[obvious]]ly all about wanting to delete a page because we don't like the people it's about. Well, guess what? We have [[Osama bin Laden]]. Look, anybody arguing that ED is not notable is making a nonsense argument, it has been mentioned in mainstream press. I think those among us who cannot laugh at our own ED pages (assuming we have them) have forgotten that life isn't always a serious endeavor. If somebody were to create a page for me saying something along the lines of "Node_ue is a faggot [[Wikipedo]] who is too obsessed with things he knows nothing about, such as Moldova or languages", I wouldn't be upset. That is because I understand [[IDIFTL|the true intention of ED, which is lulz]], not being mean and attacking people. It is intended for humor, even if it's a bit mean-spirited. If we can't laugh at ourselves, then we are already dead inside.|Node (talk) 16:30, 15 May 2008 (UTC)}}
<font size=3>And finally...</font>

{{tinyquote|'''Comment''': I feel at this point ED could have entire articles dedicated to it on CNN, and be one of the most popular websites of all time, and the decision will still be to delete it just because WP:IHATEIT is going to be ignored, and people are going to let their own prejudices get in the way of completing the encyclopedia. As many others said, this is why a good deal of people left the project in the first place, and I hate to agree, but I do.|HALtalk 22:20, 17 May 2008 (UTC)}}

===The Conclusion===
Inevitably, the article gets [[baleeted]] and the status quo is preserved: in the myopic world of [[Jimbo]], [[Invisible|certain things]] just don't exist. And even if those things happen to meet TOW's [[retarded|rigid]], [[LOL WUT|arcane]] standards of '[[notability]]', having been [[sauce]]d multiple times by the good [[retro|ole fashioned]] [[old media|newspaper]], they still may not qualify as being part of the '''[[uncyclopedia|all human knowledge]]''' TOW purports to catalogue.

===[[Irony|The Irony]]===
[[Image:Newspaper.jpg|thumb|EXTRA! EXTRA! Read all about it! TOW faggotry exposed!]]
{{tinyquote|'''Abstain'''. I'm a project participant with four years under my belt. I'm editing from a proxy for fear of retribution. This whole ED vs Wikipedia thing has become so ridiculous, those in favor of keeping will soon get an article in a national newspaper as per this (see [[AFD/ED|ED:Wikipedia Articles for deletion/Encyclopedia Dramatica]]) if this exclusionist nonsense keeps playing out. Get over your biases everyone.|--91.143.81.107 (talk) 03:41, 17 May 2008 (UTC)}}

A major national newspaper will pick up on this article and do a [[300|'''David vs Goliath''']] story on ED vs TOW. That article will then become the main source of "[[notability]]" that TOW requires ([[wikipedia:Toe Fat|occasionally]]). And even if this doesn't happen, ED wins because the ED vs TOW battle exposes how fundamentally flawed TOW's arcane and [[batshit insane|inane]] policies are and what a bunch of [[BAW|cry baby]] hypocrites Wikipedians are.

===The Conclusion: Part II===
[[Image:Adminlulzdelete.png|thumb|center|820px|Even the sadfuck admins were getting in on the act.]]
As of May 21, 2008, ED has found a home back on [[TOW]].  In a surprising turn of logic, a few [[wikipedo]] admins decided it was time for ED to be recognized as notable.  Again.  Of course, by doing this it only makes ED even [[moar]] notable, and further exemplifies the extreme mental [[retard|retardation]] so common amongst the previous [[TOW]] admins who denied it coverage.

Take note that the Encyclopedia Article is one of the most [[sauce]]-heavy stubs on [[TOW]].<small><sup>([[harbl|Citation needed]])</sup></small>
