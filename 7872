A state of being that can paradoxically refer to two opposing states:
#The state of not being smart, gifted, talented, witty, or [[dancingdrew]].
#[[Intellectual Checkmate|The state of having just completely destroyed your opponent with logic, talent, or wit]].


When somebody says that "NN is [[teh]] stupid" they always ''mean'' definition #1. However, "stupid" is also most usually the first ''[[ad hominem]]'' used by someone who has just been completely [[pwned]] - which leads us to definition #2.

Stupid people often forget to [[Scroll up]].  Don't let this happen to you; always keep your finger on that cute little [[clitoris|nubbin]] on your mouse.

However, it can also be used as a noun as in "Hey, shut up stupid!" But this is only done by euphemismfags.

Learning to differentiate between the two first mentioned is largely a matter of context, and a waste of time.

==Causes of Stupid==
Stupid is a neurological disorder, caused either by genetic disease or being dropped on your head one too many times as an infant. There is also strong evidence that you can in fact catch stupid, indicating that there may be a comunicable virus that causes the condition. This virus can only be transmitted through specific media, such as the air at a creation science conference, or the light projected by a computer screen displaying DevianTart or Gaia Online. Because it is rare for someone who isn't already at least mildly stupid to be exposed to such media, no conclusive studies have ever been done.

==Stupids==

People afflicted with stupid are reffered to by their scientific classification: "stupids." Once weeded out by natural selection, the advent of many modern safety technologies has prevented the progressive euthenization of stupids for doing stupid shit. Because of this, the percentage of stupids in the population has quadrupled since the advent of industrialization. All of them live in America. Here are a few of the effects of the increase in stupid population:

*1. We have a black president.
*2. We elected Dubya. TWICE.
*3. Adam Sandler is a box office smash.
*4. Women's rights movement.
*5. Scientology.
*6. /b/
