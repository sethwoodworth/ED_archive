== DETOXSUN, WHORE==

[[Image:Glambilly Finale by DetoxSun.jpg|thumb|DetoxSun's fursona-whore; Great Mary-sue or the greatest Mary-sue?]]

Detoxsun is a gay [[Furcadia]] player. She was born in the 1990's, but that's not a proven fact. She's probably just a 16 year old [[skank]]. She is most famously found playing a whore-tastic character dubbed "Vename."  Vename is one of the trillion commonly found slutty feline characters on [[Furcadia]]. You can view Vename's shit-tastic site here: http://www.freewebs.com/wishfulschemes/

People only [[roleplay]]ed with her because she was young and she liked attenshunz from fat men who played as buff and dominant [[furries]]. MMM tastey wolf [[cock]].

All in all, Detoxsun is an attention seeking bitch and she can't draw.

She obviously does not know what a [[penis]] looks like.


UPDATE: Her new DA account is [http://crunkthum.deviantart.com/ crunkthum]!!

== DETOXSUN, RETARD==

She has been found guilty of tracing before. However, previous accusations have been denied. She has filled our mouths with a bunch of [[crap]]. I think she may be [[Japanese]]. She claims she has removed her traced gallery, but it is in fact still there.

{{quote|1=Oh don't even get be started on that crap again. I'm so tired of it. The least you could have done was sent me a note, love, so this wouldn't be so 'out there'. No offense. It just really pisses me off that people are STILL attacking me over stupid thing I don't do any more. And it's the reason I've deleted my old gallery.|color=silver|size=100%}}

Blablablablhblahblah.

{{quote|1=I did it months ago, experimenting with styles. My recent art, which I removed, has all been drawn by me, poses rendered by me, and composed by me. I took art classes. People were attacking art I did ages ago, and which I put credit to the poses with. That'd be how they found the pictures to overlay with. If you've read my journals, you'd see that I'm sorry about something immature I did a long time ago that I don't do anymore. It was a learning process. Now I use magazines to look at, not pictures from the internet. Alot of people know, trust me. And if I wasn't sorry about the stupid mistake I did months ago, I wouldn't have deleted my gallery. I've been harrassed enough. It was a mistake made by a learning artist.|color=silver|size=100%}}

<b>OH YEAH, OKAY. TRACING PICTURES AND MAKING THEM FULL OF [[furfaggotry]] AND SELLING THEM IS A MISTAKE MADE FROM A LEARNING ARTIST.</b>

YOU CAN VIEW MORE OF HER TRACED ART ON HER [[Deviantart]]: http://detoxsun.deviantart.com

Go to her gallery and you can see that she has conveniently made a folder of all her traced art.

== DETOXSUN CONFESSES!==


{{quote|1=I paid ~$700+ for a Poser 7 program. I create and edit poses for my art.

I bought this program because I want to become an animator when I further college. Now I'm going to make all you hounds that bark about me behind my back happy. I traced the poses I created in Poser 7 for some of my art. Of the proven stolen art, I'm removing it so that there is not a problem. Yes, I admit to stealing them so I'm going to remove them. They hopefully won't be in cycle anymore. You all are pathetic in thinking that you're a victim of my 'internet-pychoticness' because I'm not the one who's an obsessed internet flamer. All of you at FAZ, go get a real hobby other than bashing someone's mistakes. It's great to find out that people are talking shit about you and then act like nothing went on when they come up to your face. Almost all of the people trying to crush me for making a stupid juvenile mistake that everyone in their lifetime may have thought about either do not know me personally, at all, or are getting all these nasty images of me from other people. Jesus, take some time to know me before you go and think I'm 'such a horrible person omgz!'. Everyone makes a mistake and I just happened to make a huge one that affected the whole art community. And even if my apology doesn't mean dipsquat to you, it means something to me and a few people that I've hurt. Good going, I congradulate you bored computer nerds for shooting down yet another artist for a dumbass mistake. And it's not going to be a shocker that this sends another ripple through the art community of Furcadia and all you people who now suddenly dispise me are going to be all high and mighty. I hope you feel so flippin' good about it, too, because, your opinions don't even matter. I'm creative and it's something that I enjoy, and if the way I enjoy makes you feel like you have to be uppity about it, go to hell.

I admit to ripping off these images of mine. And I take all responsibility even if it means I get banned from DA:

Surprising, yeah. But whatever, I don't care. <b>Hound at me all you want. Rip out all my friends and leave me hanging. Don't like my art anymore, stop watching me. Stop commissioning me. Stop letting me commission you. I don't care. Because none of you people online even matter because I'm going to live my own life how I want to live it.</b>|color=silver|size=100%}}

She's gunna live in a [[ghetto]].

Qotastic says: "You -should- be sorry. You should be apologizing to the real artists that you almost-stole- from. You -shouldn't- be taking commissions if you're not going to make your own ORIGNAL work. I really think you should refund the people who now have to discard what they recieved at the risk of being flamed. They certainly don't deserve being treated poorly because of your "mistake."


Noraneko says: "and you're not even acting like you understand. you seem like you're bitching. "oh well this is what i like to do." well good for you. then do it just like everyone else is on DA, do it originally, not by stealing people's art. you're acting like you're the one hurt; you're not! you're hurting original artists, fans, and the art community for having faith in you, and being let down. this isn't about people being bored. it's about people paying you money, hard earned money, for you to do what, use someone else's art and play it off like your own?

this isn't an apology. it's a bitchy post acting like you're accusing other people of your mistakes. you have a 700 dollar paint program? good for you! use it for something other than tracing."


Sesruc says: <b>"and to be honest, your journal entry is in a way contradicting yourself. if our opinions were worth crap, then why do you bother typing out this whole journal? why can't you just say.. "fuck them, i can do what i want"?

and wasn't trying to gain positive opinions about your art the first reason why you traced? i dunno. but that's what i see at my end of the spectrum. or was it honestly trying to develop a style? and tbh, your non-traced art had an awesome style to it that's unique to itself."</b>


Detox says: <b>"i'm unhappy with my art. people on FAZ wanted a testimony, so i gave them one. the whole reason i even did it was to gain a little 'whoo way to go girl!' from people. i wanted to be better so bad. and actually i've gotten better by seeing all angle of like.. an elbow or whatev. this journal was just to put things out there so people don't assume i'm some pyschotic bitch. i'm not."</b>


[[Tl;dr]]?
Detoxsun is a psychotic [[bitch]]. Case closed.

==SUPPORT DETOX==

Townes says: "I don't know about anyone else but I did get one or two pieces from her fully knowing ahead of time her guides and photographs she was going to use.  She literally showed me the photographs she'd be using and I said, "Cool, I like it.".  I'm 99% the original photographs were even linked in the gallery.  With that knowledge I can't possibly feel scammed or let down at all.  I paid for what I wanted.  Art of my chararacter.  Regardless if it was based on a actual photograph to me that wasn't a main concern.  I wanted the art to be of my character.  <b>She still has great talent to transform models into having animal features and color it.</b> 

Picasso once said that imitation is the greatest form of flattery.  I'm not saying this because I'm her friend.  I just wanted to share my view from a buyer's side.  I'm not saying in anyway saying tracing is fine, I do think she should of linked her references if she didn't.  In my opinion I remember often there being reference links in her gallery."

==Detox & LHF<3<3<3==

And let's face some of the facts. Detoxsun is a backstabbing cunt to everyone, but at least she doesn't show her monster ego all too often. She has been known to be gracious about her comments, 9 times out of 10 replying, but of course god forbid critique her. She can't take critique well, if at all, but she can take it better than <i>some</i> artists, namely the infamous and slut-tastic [[Ladyhellfyre|LadyHellFyre]] (who very recently [[emo|faked her own death]] on account of all the intardnet dram0rz.) 

It's also true that LHF and Detoxsun were once buddy-buddy. Their friendship ended when LHF attacked Detoxsun on a piece of her artwork, just like LHF has done to countless victims in her wish to be 'omgpopular!'. So it's no surprise that the two would be coupled in the fabulous ED.
