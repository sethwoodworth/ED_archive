Queef
[[Image:Mojamberqueef.jpg|frame|This image captions itself.]]
The most popular slang term to describe [[vagina]]l flatulence seems to be "queef." Some say the word is onomatopoeic and describes the sound the [[vagina]] makes when it unexpectedly expels air during or after [[sex]] "queef!" Others say its a combination of "[[cunt|quim]]" and "whiff." Others insist the word isn't "queef" at all, but rather "quiff." Or "queeb." Or "queever." Or "quiblet." A correspondent from Southern [[California]] says his homeboys call it a "quafe," rhyming with "safe." In eastern Canada its called a "keiff," rhyming with "knife."

==A frank discussion of vaginal flatulence==

[[Image:Queefhuffer.jpg|frame|Some people make a point of inhaling vaginal flatulence.]]

It produces tremendous sadness among consenting adults. A terrifyingly disheartening experience, it causes great distrust between couples. A neglected, regrettable cubbyhole of human sexuality, it has ruined thousands of relationships.

When a [[cunt|womans vagina]] ruins a tender moment with a loud, unexpected expulsion of Cunt Gas, what is the [[faggot|discerning gentleman]] to do? When the [[cephalopod|giant slimy clam]] opens its mouth and belches, what is the proper etiquette? Do you ignore it or try to console her or do you tell her how truly repelled you are? Do you try to make light of it with jokes such as, "Who CUNT the cheese?" Or do you immediately get up, get dressed, leave, and never call her again? Do you ridicule her as a [[Paris Hilton|cheap hooker filled with rotted sperm]]? Or do you reply with a friendly fart of your own?

Even if she only does it once, and even if you dont tell your parents or clergymen about it, her slovenly vaginal eructation will always be in the back of your mind, forever destroying any hopes for [[LOL WUT|total intimacy]]. It's something you need to talk about with your physician and your marriage counselor, and even if they're helpful, the damage may have already been done.

Were talking about queefs, gentlemen. [[cunt|Beaver]] burps. [[cunt|Muff]] music. The medical term, "vaginal flatulence," sounds like the name of a death-metal band. In England and Australia, where "fanny" is synonymous with "[[cunt|pussy]]," they call them "fanny farts." Still others call them "varts," a contraction of "vagina" and "farts."

But whatever you call it, at least call it "[[Chris Crocker|disgusting]]."

===Howard Stern===
Comedians such as [[George Carlin]], [[Howard Stern]], Richard Pryor, and Andrew "Dice" Clay have made sport of it; rare is the woman who finds queefs funny.

===Fish Whisper===
Since it typically happens during moments of [[sex]]ual rapture, at those rare, blessed moments when [[men]] and [[women]] share each other's bodies and spirits in the fullness of what it means to be a Sexual Being, the queef is perhaps the single most disgusting and soul-destroying bodily function known to mankind. Unfortunate human realities such as body odor and [[anal]] mishaps are the domain of both sexes; vaginal flatulence, like [[menstruation]], belongs in a Realm of Disgust exclusive to the fairer sex. Both male and female genitals can be seen, touched, tasted, and smelled. But only the [[vagina]] boldly ventures into the fifth sense, that of sound.

Flurpf! Fwomp! Blurp! Flap! Splat! Thar she blows! A warm, wet, stinky blast from the vaginal steamhole. How charming. How dainty. How thoroughly ladylike. Even without vaginal flatulence, the female procreative organs are a [[Centipede filled vagina|repulsive parfait of mucus membranes]] intermittently [[menstruation|exploding with blood]]; the queef is the cherry on top, proving forevermore that WOMEN CAN BE ICKY.

So whenever a group of women start ragging about how all men are [[pedophiles|disgusting]], all you need to is say a word:

"QUEEFS."

The room will become silent. The women will either slink away in shame or [[flame war|attack you en masse]].

===Cunt Grunts===
The queef is shrouded in disinformation and misunderstanding. This reporter could find no direct medical texts dealing with the topic of "vaginal flatulence," and this after days of wading through [[google]]. Surprisingly scant literature exists on a subject acknowledged as so universal. This may be evidence that even doctors are embarrassed that it happens and don't want to think about it.

A physician friend likewise came up with no solid research but instead offered the following opinions:

"I did a MedLine search on vaginal flatulence and found jack diddly. However, based on some personal reflection it is most likely due to the architecture of the particular [[cunt|vagina]]. Firm vaginas allow for a tighter seal around the [[penis]], letting less air penetrate into the [[cunt|vaginal vault]] when the piston-like action of intercourse occurs. This forces air into, and then out of the dead end of the [[cunt|vagina]]. It would follow then, that [[unbirthing|loose vaginal muscles]] will allow queefing to occur. What causes [[unbirthing|loose vaginas]] is academic; however, but if a human being has tumbled out of it, or if it's been mercilessly penetrated, logic would indicate these as probable contributors."

A group of women on a post-hysterectomy [[BBS]] reported an increase in pussy-farting after their operations, [[Some argue|which lends credence]] to the idea that it's caused by a loose [[cunt|vagina]]. There is also a phenomenon known as "windsucking"; basically, equine pussy-farting that occurs among [[furries|female horses]] whose [[bestiality|cunt-caves have been rendered slack]] after giving birth.

===A bustle in your hedgerow===
[[Over 9000|Several accounts]] suggest that it occurs most often during "[[Win|doggy style]]" intercourse. Many other women report pussy-farting during [[orgasm]]. This may be due to the fact that a womans vaginal muscles expand and contract during [[orgasm]] like chimney bellows, sucking air in and then blowing it out.

Queefing is not always caused by sexual activity, because some women claim to get them during yoga squats or other strenuous feats. Through skillful vaginal flexing, many women can actually produce them at will, causing [[lulz|great mirth]] at [[loli|slumber parties]] and in the girls' bathroom.

There's ample cinematic evidence of such willful vaginal flatulence. Most notorious is perhaps a 1979 Mitchell Brothers film featuring one "Honeysuckle Divine" and her amazing talking snatch. A thing of repellent wonder, Ms. Divines [[cunt|poony-ya-ya]] quacks and snorts and breathes and shoots ping-pong balls and blows out candles to the snickering delight of a [[San Francisco|SF]] grindhouse [[gay|audience]]. Another video has circulated for years that was allegedly sent by a wannabe groupie to virtuoso guitarist Steve Vai. For what seems like ten hours, she tries to woo the fast-fingered rocker by making frapping sounds with her sloppy starfucker [[cunt|gash]]. There are also reports of [[porn]] vids wherein a saucy female blows out every flame in a candelabrum with her snatch before drinking a goblet of [[cum]]; another where a girl fanny-farts into a flute; even a video called "Amber the Lesbian Queefer."

But in stark contrast to such willful queefers stand perhaps [[at least 100|millions]] of women who not-so-silently endure the humiliation and social stigma of involuntary vaginal flatulence. What's worse is that there's no way to tell whether a potential mate will be prone to queefing. It's not like the [[vagina]] is a coal mine and [[bestiality|you can send a canary]] in there to test whether [[hugbox|it's safe]].

I have a friend who, back in his high-school days, dated a gal who once queefed nonstop for a half-minute after he pulled his meatbone out of her.

It was to be their last date. The next day in [[school]], he told everyone of her vagina's didgeridoo-like performance. They all laughed and started making cruel farting noises whenever she'd walk by them in the hallway. She was emotionally ruined and probably became a [[nun]] or a [[stripper]].

===Minge Bubbles===
I once knew a [[skeezer|girl]] who queefed so much, it was as if her [[cunt]] was a set of worn bagpipes hiding under her tartan schoolgirl dress. She had straight black hair, a round face, and nostrils big enough to insert coins in them. And her [[cunt]] snorted like a bronco. It was a frickin whoopie cushion, let me tell ya. She spent much of our relationship speaking through a muff megaphone. She was disgusted and ashamed of her relentlessly belching cuntflaps. It humiliated her to the point of [[violence]] on more than one occasion.

Her mortification at queefing was directly tied to the hatred she bore for her [[vagina]], which was directly tied to her guilt, which was directly tied to her low [[self-esteem]], which was directly tied to the lowness of her self. She localized her self-hatred in the act of queefing, rather than the proper place, i.e. her entire being.

===Cunt Cookies===
One mouth is never enough for a woman. Maybe we aren't listening closely enough, and maybe there is a message deep inside those talking [[vagina]]s, if we can only get past our understandable disgust. Like the Voyager space craft, which included a golden record and diagrams of the male and female bodies in order to present a picture of our culture to extraterrestrial species, might it not be possible that our own creator encoded a message to his creations in the form of the Queef?
