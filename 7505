Significant other
The expression was invented by [[NO U|Limp Bizkit]], a mediocre band of Wayward metalheads who mostly rap about [[Girlfriends]] and destroying shit.

[[woman|Women]] whom have failed at being [[man|men]] decided it was [[win|politically incorrect]] to put labels on people and so '''significant others''' were [[an hero|born]].

Whilst it is obvious that no "other" can be of any significance whatsoever, the [[fail|self-help]] book market found it to be a valuable [[tool]] for sales and soon sincere, direct expressions such as "[[whore|my spouse]]", "black person" and "the child I abducted last week" were replaced by "[[masturbation|my significant other]]."

The phrase is commonly used in [[Genital Herpes]] commercials to make [[your mom|women]] believe that having sores in their [[cunt|twats]] won't prevent them from [[asking for it|finding love]].
Usually [[vomit|barfed]] by [[hipsters]], homosexuals and bitter divorc√©es after a couple of [[faggotry|Martinis]], '''significant others''' are artificial extensions of the aforementioned douchebags, much like a [[trying too hard|prosthetic arm]] or [[Iphone|dildo]].

[[LOL WUT|Recent findings]] show that most '''significant others''' are both [[My Chemical Romance|imaginary]] and unaware of the fact that [[lonely|someone out there]] believes that he/she is in a [[Gay|sentimental]] relationship with them. It has been [[magick|statistically demonstrated]] that people who have [[Dying alone|significant others]] are more likely to die of cancer and AIDS than people who have unprotected sex with niggers once a month.
