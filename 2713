'''Esperanto''' is a language created [[At least 100 years ago|over 120 years ago]] by a Jewish  bicyclist in an ambitious attempt to make a new international language, while improving on the superficial flaws of previous ones, like [[gay|French]] and [[christfag|Latin]].  It is mostly used by people too [[America|retarded]] to learn a [[English|real language]].  It has its own chan which is currently fail. [http://esperantochan.co.cc]

=Overview=
A pidgin language, combining aspects of [[AOL speak]], [[Leet]], and [[Klingon]].  It was created as a nationalist language for Easter Island, due to the fact that the previous dialect, Easteringer, was absorbed into the sand after a terrible monsoon, resulting in the formation of several hundred gigantic stone [[Voraphile]] cockmen.

''Malkompleta lingvo, kombinanta [[AOL speak|AOL parolon]], [[Leet]], kaj la [[klingon]]an. Ĝi estis kreita kiel naciisma lingvo por Paskinsulo, pro la fakto ke la antaŭa dialekto, Easteringero, absorbiĝis en la sablon post terura musono, kio rezultis en la formiĝo de pluraj centoj da grandegaj ŝtonaj [[Voraphile|Vorafilaj]] black person.''

=History=
Esperanto was created by a dirty Pollack by the name of [[Karl Marx|L. L. Zamenhof]]. [[Poland]] back then was part of the [[Russia|Russian Empire]] and many languages were spoken where he lived. His neighbors spoke [[Hebrew|Yiddish]], German, Belorussian, Russian, Italian, and least importantly Polish. He knew all those languages at a fluent level, but he noticed that most of his [[ghetto|neighbors]] could only speak [[stupid|one language]] and they fought all the time due to lack of clear communication. So Zamenhof did what any successful [[troll]] would do, learn [[over 9000|more languages]]. He learned [[shit nobody cares about|French, Latin, Greek, Hebrew and English]]. 

Unfortunately Zamenhof got [[troll's remorse]] and decided he needed to create an easy language so people as different from each other as the Russians and Belorussians could communicate in ease. Hence he created [[Spanish|Esperanto]]. He published ''[[Rtfm|Unua Libro]]'' on July 26, 1887. In less than a year [[noone|everyone]] in Eastern Europe was fluent in Esperanto. It became the official language of the [[Soviet Union]]. 

Since 80% of Eastern Europe was mostly Jews, when they all immigrated to [[America]] they brought Esperanto with them. Grover Cleveland became the first [[president]] to be elected fluent in Esperanto. Theodore Roosevelt was the man responsible for making Esperanto the official language of the United States of America. With German, English and [[Mexican]] having secondary status. 

By 1939, [[Germany]] was one of the few countries in the planet that didn't have Esperanto as their official language, even though most of the population was fluent in it. [[Hitler]] found Esperanto to be intimidating and [[Fucktard|difficult]], so he did what any reasonable man would do, create a [[Holocaust|soap factory]].Stalin, Roosevelt, and [[Winston Churchill]] didn't like this, so they decided to take [[World War the Second|Hitler's lunch money]] and [[Iraq|liberated]] the hell out of Germany.

Some time early in 2010, a new Esperanto chan appeared. It marked the beginning of a new age for [[Aspie]]s, where they could use a new medium for their [[furry]] antics. Unfortunately as of May '10 it doesn't seem very active, which suggests that people who speak Esperanto have lives outside of the internet, which is surprising seeing as they had the time to learn a made-up language (most likely over the internet). Also there seems to be some [[music]] piracy going on there which is pretty good because I previously couldn't find La Pafklik's new album.
