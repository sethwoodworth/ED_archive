[[Reddit]] (aka 4chan with a condom) is a <s>[[Digg|Digg-clone]]</s> news aggregation website for [[retards|pseudo-intellectuals]], leftarded [[CSIII|Computer Science]] majors, [[Liberal]] pussies and [[hipsters]] who feel that having a superior [[Shit nobody cares about|"Karma Score"]] increases your chances of [[secks|getting laid]]. It was founded by two hippie douche bags that [[truth|were high on weed and wanted to "stick it" to Kevin Rose]]. In October 2006, the owners sold out to some big company. This means that they are now a bunch of poser faggots. 

==About==

[[Image:Reddit-digg.jpg|thumb|right|]]
Reddit.com is a sweltering hole of pig shit and unfunny memes. Its user base consists entirely of [[Liberal]] [[Atheist|God-less]] faggots who would gladly take a wad of cum to the face from [[Obama|President Obama]] if the opportunity ever presented itself. The [[Liberal Butthurt Syndrome]] exhibited by Redditors is so well-defined that some of them have even taken to editing this article in order to cut out all the nasty bits about [[Liberals]]... only to find out that their butthurt edits get reverted by the undo button after a few minutes. Discussion on reddit usually consists of one party expressing a leftist viewpoint, the next person agreeing with that viewpoint and a third person making a pun out of the original post. After this point, we hit [[tldr]] where it dissolves into a massive circlejerk and an orgy of confirmation bias and self-reaffirmation. To receive karma on Reddit, one must have the political views of an angst-riddled pseudo-socialist college teenager who regularly visits Infowars.com and discusses the perils of corporatism over coffee at Starbucks. While Reddit often complains about Digg stealing their content, its users blatantly ignore the fact that most of its posts are reposts from [[4chan]] and links to the [[Daily Kos]]. It must be noted that Reddit is also a propaganda website for [[Hamas]] and that it's [[gaming]] section consists of nothing but nostalgia circlejerks and posts about how [[Valve]] is the best company [[evar]].

==Founders==

=== Alexis Ohanian ===
After having gone through life with a hippy, faggot name like Alexis, he was ascended to Internet goddess status.

=== Steve Huffman ===
No information available. Rumoured to have never existed. Possibly made up by Alexis.

== Reddit's Inferiority Complex ==
[[Image:Reddit_user.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The average Reddit user]]
Redditors spend a great deal of their time mocking [[Digg]] and its [[13-year-old_boy|userbase]]. This is because, deep down, they feel inferior. So in order to smother that sense of inferiority, they constantly tell each other that they are intelligent and that Reddit is the best place [[evar|ever]]! Redditors will often tell you that they are smarter than your regular [[Digg]] user and that there are far more [[Shit nobody cares about|intellectual discussions]] on Reddit than on [[Digg]]. This commonly-seen statement contradicts the fact that 90% of Reddit discussions consist of badly-made puns and faux [[liberal]] outrage about how fascist [[America]] has become (But black person is still cool, right guys, right?). The saddest thing about all of this is that 9/10 Digg users have never even heard of Reddit. If a Digg user were to land on the Reddit homepage, he or she should not be blamed for thinking that the site is a [[blogging]] website, as the amount of [[blog|self posts]] outnumber links to actual news stories by 10-1.

==Reddit's Worldview/Hivemind==

===WIKILEAKS, WIKILEAKS, WIKILEAKS===
According to Reddit, Wikileaks is the bestest most superest organization in the world; and spokesperson [[Terrorist|Julian Assange]] is a noble hero who wards off evil governments that oppress their people! Julian Assange can do no wrong. He pisses peace, shits freedom and he certainly [[fact|rapes women in Sweden]]. It's ok that he sometimes editorializes his releases as long as the editorializing in question falls into line with the left-wing narrative of the Reddit hivemind. It's okay that his organization releases names, threatens relationships between countries and puts informants in danger; because at the end of the day, the truth is like, more important, man!

{{quote|Especially how he didn't really raise his voice while that "interviewer" constantly interrupted him. I need to get me a shirt with this guy's face on it, ASAP.|'''Quatroking''' - ''commenting on his love for Assange the rapist.''}}

====Wikileaks gets owned by PayPal====
When the Wikileaks PayPal account was suspended, the amount of [[butthurt]] on Reddit reached critical levels. Left-wing hippies threw their hands into the air and condemned PayPal for following their terms and conditions. Some of them were so butthurt that they cancelled their PayPal accounts; not that it mattered because everyone in the world knows that [[truth|pseudo-Socialist college students don't have any money]].

====Assange gets owned by Time====
When Time magazine announced that Jew was their person of the year for 2010, the left-wing terrorist-sympathizers on Reddit shit their pants in anger and denounced Time for not giving the award to their hero [[Rape|Julian Assange]]. Redditors, in such a fit of anger, failed to realize that this was an award for "Person of the Year"; not "[[Rapist]] of the Year". The [[butthurt]] got to such a [[Lulz|high level]] that many of the mouth-breathers on Reddit began to post topics such as '''"Who the fuck cares who Time declared as the person of the year? I KNOW I DON'T I FUCKING HATE THEM AND HOPE THEY ALL DIE!!!!!!!!"''' All of these sweet sweet tears came about because apparently, [[Rape|Julian Assange]] had won a poll for Person of the Year on Time magazine's website. The funny thing is that prior to this, Reddit users would have questioned the validity of any result from an online poll, but this time; because their God Julian Assange had come out on top, they were more than willing to ignore how online poll results are often skewed because of tampering. In fact, only a few days before the poll was closed, Redditors were posting threads asking other people to mass-vote for Assange. 

Because the [[hipsters]] on Reddit hate [[Facebook]] so much (it's far too mainstream), seeing its founder Jew beat their savior [[Rapist|Assange]] added so much insult to injury that it is believed many Reddit users instantly committed suicide. Which is a good thing.

===Arab Apologists===
[[Image:Zomg.png|thumb|right|Reddit loves Muslims.]]
[[File:rworldnewsreddit.jpg|thumb|right|Typical r/WorldNews submitters.]]
[[Image:Angry_muslims.jpg|thumb|230px|right|r/worldnews Reddit meetup]]

Since 99% of the Reddit population is made up of bleeding-heart [[Liberals]], [[Muslims|anti-semites]] and [[Leftard|Islamophiles]], Redditors continuously go out of their way to downplay any negative press about the Arab world... because, like, that's just racist, dude. This is because your regular left-wing hippy douchebag on Reddit feels as if he needs to make amends for the bad rap that Western media outlets have been giving those [[terrorist|peaceful Muslims]]. According to Reddit, the [[Israel]]-[[Palestine]] conflict is a [[niggers|black]] and [[white]] issue of good versus evil, with [[Palestine]] being the underdog and the crusader against injustice, and Israel being the evil tyrant that harvests the skin of dead Muslim babies. Don't ever bring that point up though, as the desktop activists on Reddit will make a barrage of excuses, discard your point completely and then downvote you into oblivion; proving the point that you don't have to be a crazy [[conservative|right-winger]] in order to be a fascist [[you|cunt]]. Any criticism of Hamas on Reddit will be met with a fury of [[butthurt|downvotes]], because in the eyes of most Redditors, [[Hamas]] didn't really intend to carry out [[Over 9000|over 50]] suicide bombings in [[Israel]] - The truth is that it was all just one big misunderstanding as [[Islam]] is really just a religion of peace. You'll also find that any negative news press or critism towards Middle-Eastern countries such as Iran is purposely deflected by commentators making shallow soundbyte remarks such as "WELL THE USA IS JUST AS BAD!!!1"... because that makes everything A-ok, [[amirite]]? It is also funny to note that for such an open-minded community of Liberals, Reddit does a great job of ignoring the human rights violations of [[homosexuals]] and [[women]] in Middle-Eastern countries. The r/WorldNews section on Reddit is the worst offender. While hearsay and pro-Arab propaganda gets upvoted to the heavens above (seriously, a Youtube video created by the propaganda arm of Al-Qaeda once got upvoted to the front page.... BECAUSE CNN DOESN'T TELL US REAL NEWS!), news stories about actual [[Darfur|genocides]] going on in other countries float around at the bottom of the barrel... all because those events have nothing to do with teh [[Jews]].
[[File:IrrationalHateForIsrael.png|thumb|right|Yes this is real. A self-post lamenting the overwhelming pro-Israel sentiment on reddit that ends with "fuck Israel" has 1k+ votes.]]


{{Quote |in celebration of 9/11 i watch all the old tapes i recorded from that day, the news coverage, then just masturbate onto an american flag and praise allah for a bit. then i defend muslims on reddit, normally i just say burning their books isn't cool and jews are being mean to them so fuck off jews. then i look at pictures of cats with funny captions while reading the huffington post (only legit news source) then i get ready for glenn beck, which i watch while cutting my wrists and letting the blood drip onto a picture of beck. then i start buying drawing supplies for 'draw mohhamed day' and then i go start a protest for gay rights. then i fire up a 'baw' thread on /b/ and ask people on there how i can get a girlfriend. after that thread 404's i sit in my basement and play starcraft until dad starts asking for rent, capitalist fatcat.

===Obamabots===
The [[USA]] is falling to shit man! The country is turning into a [[police]] state and we still have troops in [[Afghanistan]]! [[Obama]] is still cool though.

===Hipsters===
It is no secret that Reddit is full to the brim with pretentious chic-look-loving [[hipsters]]. Once upon a time, hating on [[hipsters]] actually used to be a cool thing to do on Reddit, but now... because '''everyone else is doing it''', your common Reddit douchebag feels as if "hipster bashing" has become far too mainstream. So, being the counter-cultural vintage [[you|fucks]] that they are, Redditors now come out in defense of Hipsters, as shown in the comment screencapped in the image below. While defending the hipster subculture, your regular Reddit fucktard will pretend as if he an unbiased observer, even though it's pretty clear to anyone who has two brain cells to rub together that the poster is most likely a V-neck-top-wearing-thick-rimmed-glasses-loving cunt who is sitting in front of a Mac.

===Brainwashed Liberals===
If you're looking for some quick karma on Reddit, simply state that "reality has a Liberal bias". Seriously - people have been upvoted to heaven for saying this. The funny thing is: If a [[conservative]] were to state the opposite, the [[Leftards]] on Reddit would be the first to call that person brainwashed/batshit insane. The /r/politics subsection on Reddit has become nothing more than an echo chamber for leftist viewpoints, with centrist and conservative opinion pieces being downvoted into oblivion. While the propaganda shills on /r/politics love to complain about the conservative bias of media outlets such as [[Fox News]], they seem to have absolutely no problem in upvoting partisan [[Daily Kos]] articles.

Back off, and stop repealing our freedom of speech. I know I sound like some kind of crackpot journalist but "the people have a right to know." If anything it should be a wakeup call..."Oh, damn. Our security has been breached and now clandestine operations are in jeopardy!" Maybe you should have considered the possibility before being such dishonest bastards....just sayin' | Unicyclehippie}}

===Reddit Hates Jews===
[http://novascone.com/antisemitism-on-reddit-social-media.html No, seriously - they really do]. Bring this point up and the pro-Muslim lobby on Reddit will quickly tell you that hating Israel does not make you an anti-semite. Here is how a typical conversation about antisemitism unfolds on Reddit.

'''Redditor 1:''' The Jews control the media and Hitler was right to try and exterminate the bastards.

'''Redditor 2:''' Eh... you're being an anti-semite!

'''Redditor 3:''' Hating Israel does not make you an anti-semite.

'''Redditor 2:''' What? I never said it did?! He was talking about the Jews controlling the media and Hitler being right!

'''Redditor 4:''' Nice try, Mossad.

'''Redditor 2:''' The fuck?

'''Redditor 3:''' Hit the road Zionist shill. 


====Proof that Reddit hates those filthy Jews====
[[Image:Jewbot.png|Notice how many upvotes this comment got.]]

===The JIDF===
It all started when down syndrome-sufferer and Reddit user 'scordatura' broke free from his <s>carers</s> keepers and managed to create a <s>fucktarded</s> run-of-the-mill post on r/politics, which was titled:

{{quote|DAE find that when they post anything the slightest bit critical of Israel, their post, and anything else they've posted since the dawn of time gets ruthlessly downvoted? Here's why. And by the way: Fuck Israel.|'''scordatura''' - ''karma whoring his way to the top of r/politics with some nicely-tuned hyperbole''}}

The link that scordatura posted led to a small-time website that was run by a bunch of Internet [[Jewish]] Warriors. 

The funny thing about this post?

a) Links to negative news stories about Israel usually reach the front-page of Reddit within 0.013 seconds, '''even if they're found to be over a year old'''. In one case; a video created by the propaganda wing of [[Muslims|Al-Qaeda]] was upvoted to the top of [[terrorists|/r/WorldNews]] because it cast [[Israel]] in a negative light. When the self-described [[LOL|intellectuals]] on Reddit discovered that they had made a terrible mistake by upvoting a piece of propaganda to the front-page, they blushed a little, left the thread and went right back to upvoting anything that was critical of [[Jews|Israel]]. Reddit users will often pretend as if there are powerful [[Jews|forces]] out there that are willing to downvote and bury reputable news stories.... which is pretty hilarious, considering the fact that Reddit users often systematically downvote posts and comments that contradict their microscopic view of the world.

b) This relatively small website of about 250 [[Jewish]] Internet tough guys had never even heard of Reddit before scordatura decided to link to their website and send the money-grabbing [[Jews]] a spike of traffic and a tasty increase in ad revenue.

Later on, after scores of [[lies|rational]]-thinking Reddit users had upvoted scordatura's post to the front page and beyond, the Reddit anti-spam system automatically deleted the post because it detected a bout of "vote cheating". Immediately, Redditors grabbed their pitchforks and began to cry out about "censorship" and a conspiracy to bury the truth. Reddit user Bookthievery became the first in line to attention-whore his way to the top of Reddit with his self-post, which was titled:

{{quote|This is a disgusting assault on free speech on Reddit. A post criticizing Israel's internet downvote brigade just got removed from Reddit's front page!|'''Bookthievery''' - ''on why there's no herp without the derp''}}

Soon enough, Reddit admin HueyPriest replied to the post and explained what had happened:

{{quote|This post was removed by an admin for anti-cheating reasons. The whole thing is a mess with cheating votes in both directions. It wasn't removed for any censorship or political reasons. We're just trying to preserve the integrity of voting on reddit.
edit: additional text added below for clarity
This post in question was banned because of cheating (people were trying to inflate the amount of upvotes). We are well aware of the cheating alleged by the post itself and we are dealing with that fine in the majority of cases. Sometimes the spam countermeasures can deal with cheating fine and sometimes we need to ban a post. I wish I could get into more detail about the spam filter, but I can't even though I know that only fuels the conspiracy theories.
We (and the spam filter) make decisions based on the data we see, not on anything else. Please remember that just because there is a story about a "downvote brigade" or even clear evidence of them organizing elsewhere online, does not mean that they are or have ever been successful. I know this is a very important and emotional issue for everyone. We take cheating and allegations of cheating very seriously, and we work our asses off to stop it no matter what side or issue or organization it comes from.|'''Bookthievery'''}}

TL;DR - Reddit users complained about a Jewish conspiracy to downvote articles. In reality, Reddit users were trying to game the upvote/downvote system by artificially increasing the post's score.

POST TL;DR - Reddit users are not as intelligent or rational as they pretend to be.

===MEN ARE EVEN MORE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST THAN WOMEN!!===
Male Redditors love dwelling in their own gender-based victim complex. Whenever a story pops up about a [[woman]] being [[rape|wronged]], an army of [[you|pasty-faced basement dwellers]] who have spent their entire lives being [[You|rejected by women]] descend onto the thread with all of their sexless fury in order to set the record straight and let it be known that men also face discrimination!1!1!! '''Even though nobody stated the opposite.''' The high level of misogyny on Reddit is unusual, as the site is mostly used by hippy Liberal douchebags, who you'd think would be a little more open-minded. But then again, why would someone who spends their Saturday nights playing [[WOW]] and jacking off to [[Hentai]] care about political inclinations when it comes to topics about the opposite sex?

[http://i.imgur.com/pO4hD.png These are the same guys who wonder why they're still a virgin.]

====Nice Guy Syndrome====
A lot of Redditors are under the illusion that women only reject them because they are "too nice".  These are the same members that hold an elitist, psuedo-intellectual attitude and then can't figure out why women reject them.  What they won't tell you is how they're incapable of being nice in real life, yet [[narcissist|they'll keep telling themselves how nice they were to them]].

====Ugly girls are pretty!!====
A lot of male Redditors say things such as "I only go for girls who don't wear makeup" as if they somehow have a choice in the matter. They'll all sit around telling one another that they prefer girls who don't match up to the media-induced standards of what contemporary society considers beauty. The sad thing is, after this make-me-feel-better-about-only-being-able-to-score-with-fat-chicks circlejerk comes to an end, they descend back into their basements in order to spend their evening jacking off to [[Hentai|10s]].

==Subreddits==

[[File:Reddit sickfuck.png|thumb|500px|An excellent platform to share your secret pedophilic activities with the rest of the world.]]

In case the reddit hivemind isnt precise enough for you, here are some sub-sub-cultures you may wish to engage in:
* /r/Gaming/, Yet another [[fanboi|fanboi]] circle-jerk, this time involving Valve.  Be sure to post plenty of comments and articles that bash [[Portal]]; they love that.
* /r/Jailbait/, In which [[pedophiles]] talk about having sex with minors and trade [[cp]]. No, seriously.
* /r/whalebait/, Where cetaceaphiliacs trade pictures of [[whales]] [[Gimps Gone Wild|gone wild]].
* /r/Atheism/, In which everyone posts their personal story about the [[Mormon]] church.
* /r/Politics/, The official [[Democrat|Democrat Party's]] blog. Also an RSS aggregation service for the [[Daily Kos]].
* /r/WTF/, Where people from /r/Politics repost stuff that they don't agree with. "WTF? Republicans said X!"
* /r/Worldnews/, In which [[Terrorists|Hamas supporters]] get trolled by Israel all day. 
* /r/programming/, Where [[neckbeard|neckbeards]] post links to programming articles and berate others for their choice of programming language because it fills that dark hole left open by being a sexless 25 year old.
* /r/IamA/, In which college students majoring in English dwell in their dorm rooms and practice their fictional writing skills, usually succeeding in trolling reddit for a few hours.  An example: "IAmA guy who attended a [[Tea Party]] rally in Washington D.C.  AMA."
* /r/DoesAnyoneElse/, In which people find that they are identical to every other redditor. An example: "Does anyone else here like not being on fire?".  It doubles as a circle-jerk for identifying little inconveniences that [[nobody cares]] about in real life.  An example: "Does anyone else hate the little [[e-penis|squiggly red line]] under misspelled words?"
* /r/circlejerk/, Where redditors get together and talk about literally circle jerking with each other.  If they left their parents' basements, they would get together in real life to do this.
* /r/reddithax/, Where three users post lame CSS and JS "[[hacks]]" that serve no use and, therefore, nobody else cares about.
* /r/linux/, In which people complain about [[Windows]] and compare strategies for avoiding [[Snakes on a Plane|soap]].
* /r/apple, Where condescending, hipster, Apple fanboys have pseudo-intellectual discussions about Apple's business decisions and fictional sex stories of sucking Steve Jobs's cock.  Anything submitted here that is satirical and Apple-related is quickly downvoted to hell.
* /r/Microsoft, See above and replace "Apple" with "Microsoft" and "Steve Jobs" with "Steve Ballmer".
* /r/tf2/, In which people complain about furkle trolling in [[Team Fortress 2]].
* /r/evedreddit/, In which people complain about furkle trolling [[EVE Online]].
* /r/incest/, In which people blur the line between Reddit and /b/ even further
* /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu/, In which they post [[rage]] comics they stole from /b/. Or, if they are really feeling unfunny, they make their own, usually spamming [[trollface]] saying "problem?", clearly [[doing it wrong]].
* /r/Science/, In which they are suddenly an expert in whatever field is being discussed. They also [[hypocrite|bitch about how evil GMOs are]].
* /r/MensRights/, A subreddit for men with victim complexes. Usually visited by men who post 'false rape' articles and whine about the justice system being more protective of women in rape cases. No shit, assholes. Each of these posters have never had a girlfriend before in their lives, even if they think they had one.
* /r/Conspiracy/, Where [[Hasbara]] agents post nonsense conspiracies and cry Anti-Semitism when others call them out on it or expose [[Israel|Jewish]] crimes.
* /r/Pics/, Where Redditors post old pictures from 10 years ago.
* /r/Funny, In which users submit corny jokes.  An example: "I didn't go see that [[Mel Gibson]] movie, The Passion of the Christ.  I already read the book!  LOL!"
* /r/TodayILearned, A subreddit for those wishing to share Wikipedia articles with one another.
* /r/AskReddit, Where your typical Reddit fucknut will ask rhetorical questions.
* /r/Islam, Where terrorists and Left-Wing [[Liberal]] Islamophiles hang out.
* /r/JustinBieber, Complaints about 40 year olds going nuts over a piece of jailbait.
* /r/EmmaWatson, 40 year olds going nuts over a piece of jailbait.
* /r/comics, Where the same bunch of popular shitty web comics get posted over and over again.  The punchlines are all the same:  Something dark, twisted, nerdy and sick happens, and then it gets upvoted to the high heavens as if it's the funniest thing to have ever been drawn.
* /r/TwoXChromosomes, Where the same basement-dwelling, sexless, male nerds pretend to be girls on reddit because there are [[no girls on the Internet]].
* /r/sports, Where nerds who suck at sports come together and pretend to have the mindset of a team's owner or general manager.  Too bad these mindsets don't get you those jobs, nerds!

==Things Reddit Fanboys Care About ==

* Python, even though 99% of them have never even used it. much less know how to program with this language.
* [[Terrorists|Palestinians]].
* [[Jon Stewart]].
* Conan O' Brien. Even though he doesn't give a shit about them.
* [[Steven Colbert]], who once mentioned that one of his interns visited the site. Making them famous!

* Anything relating to [[Team Fortress 2]].

* Al Jazeera English is considered the most bestest unbiased news source on Reddit... because it panders to their worldview.

== How to get onto the front page of Reddit ==
[[File:trolling_reddit.png|thumb|350px|right|Successful trolls are successful.]]
* '''Copy anything from 4chan and upload it''', Reddit is a place full of people who think they are "better" than 4chan, when in reality 99% of it is 4chan.
* Write a self post claiming to be a girl with a random question.  Wait 3 hours and then come back to have as many comments as positive karma points.
* Proclaim that [[Glenn Beck]] is the devil.
* State that the war in [[Iraq]] was/is illegal.

== How to get positive comment karma ==
[[Image:Offbeat.jpg|thumb|35pxx|right|OMG you are so fucking clever! UPVOATED!!! Clearly, Reddit is a bastion of intellect]]
By making stupid, corny, nerd puns, the other Redditors will think you're witty and clever and easily upvote you to [[over 9000]] points.  If you're desperate for karma, you might have to lower your IQ a few points in order to come up with these bad puns.  If you're not willing to do this, then don't worry about it.  Just flame the shit out of these Redditors by reminding them how bad their jokes suck and how much smarter you are than them.  They'll reward you with so much negative karma, you won't know what to do with yourself.

== E-Famous Reddit Users ==

* '''Saydrah''': Saydrah (aka ''that fucking bitch whore of a cunt'') was a [[female]] power user on Reddit who was outed by the unwashed masses after it was revealed that she had been offering to submit links for people in exchange for money. On her LinkedIn profile, Saydrah bragged about how she was "respected" and "influential" within the Reddit community. Once this all came to light, Redditors shat their pants in [[butthurt|anger]], grabbed their pitchforks and set forth in motion, the biggest witch hunt (moar liek bitch hunt, [[amirite]]?) in Reddit history. As the mob mentality steadily took over, 9/10 submissions on the Reddit front page became Saydrah-related (as opposed to pictures of [[cats]] with captions on them), as thousands of angry [[male]] Redditors screamed out for her blood. Saydrah even complained about her family receiving threatening phone calls, which shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, as Reddit '''is''' [[Serious business|serious business]]. It is also widely believed by Redditors that Saydrah was the pilot flying the helicopter in the Wikileaks video and that she was also [[truth|somehow]] connected to the events on 9/11.
* '''violentacrez''': Although it was once rumored that violentacrez has a life outside of Reddit, official reports from authoritative sources have confirmed that this is simply not the case and that anyone who insists otherwise is [[lying]]. violentacrez is currently the [[moderator]] of 99% of all subreddits. In his spare time (which is basically all day long), this widely renowned pedophile moderates the "Jailbait" subreddit that he founded over a year ago. It is important to note that violentacrez once threw a hissy fit and stomped his feet like a little spoiled child when he found out that a few users were posting pictures of girls that were above the legal age. Being the basement-dwelling [[pedophile]] that he is, violentacrez threatened to unleash the [[banhammer]] on anyone found to be posting pictures of fully-developed [[women]]. Whenever his name is mentioned in an obscure thread, violentacrez seems to appear out of nowhere with a "HEY GUISE WHAT'S GOIN ON IN THIS THREAD?"-styled reply. This has led many to believe that he is operating several bots that scour Reddit for his instances of his name. However, it is more likely that he is just an egotistical cunt who CTRL + F's his name whenever he visits a thread; as his levels of [[Unwarranted Self-Importance]] would power the world if somebody somewhere were able to figure out a way to convert it into a viable energy source. violentacrez is applauded by the Reddit admins for contributing so much to the community. Beyond his contribution of pedophile subreddits, violentacrez is known to be a conspiracy theorist who [http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/dapog/meanwhile_on_a_quiet_israel_beach/c0yz8ha hates Jews]. Quote: '''"Hey, Jew, what's up? Stolen anyone's home lately?"''' The fact that the Reddit admins openly support such an antisemitic person shouldn't come as a surprise as Reddit '''is''' a propaganda website for [[Hamas]] [http://www.reddit.com/r/jewmerica A great subreddit started up by Violentacrez].
* '''probablyhittingonyou''' karmanaut's son.
* '''johnny_cash''': Possibly the most batshit insane user on Reddit; and that's saying a lot. When not making statements about [[Jews]] controlling the weather, johnny_cash spends his time [http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dc1w1/ted_koppel_man_we_fucked_up_our_911_response/c0z4us9 accusing other Redditors of being disinformation agents]. Funnily enough, a lot of johnny_cash's comments end up getting positive scores on Reddit. This is especially true in r/politics, where every crazy tinfoil-hat-wearing [[leftard]] applauds him for his insightful comments. He decided that he was unpopular when he hit the -3000 mark and started posting the same stuff under the name ''jerimiah_johnson''.
