And you thought normal [[memes]] were [[unfunny]]...

'''Buzzkilling''' aka. '''moar like this''' is a relatively new [[shit|fad]], depicting situations where something is out of place. These situations are narrated awkwardly for comedic effect as a form of [[anti-lulz]]. If [[you]] ever wanted to know what type of humour people with [[Aspergers syndrome]] have - this is it.  Most people who practice buzzkilling are old, fat [[Christfags]] who still giggle at the word [[penis]].

==Origin==
The original came from one of [[Something Awful]]'s [[Exploitable]] threads of 2004 in which [[Goons]] were challenged to shoop a poster which read "PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES - KEEP YOUR [[dog|DOG]] UNDER CONTROL AT ALL TIMES." The winrar, pictured right, threw the joke format right out of the window and replaced it with "THOSE ARE MY SHOES - GIVE THEM BACK, YOU ARE A DOG, THEY DON'T EVEN FIT."[http://www.somethingawful.com/d/comedy-goldmine/safety-message-from.php]

The fact that one iteration of a five year old meme has become a meme in itself says something about the need for [[Original Content]].

==Name==
Although a few of these pictures had been floating around the [[internets|web]] for a while, there was no official title for them to go by and thus, no way for [[newfags]] to latch onto this meme and overuse it. In the early morning of November 19th, 2008, users on [[4chan|4chan's]] [[/b/]] proposed a few different names and eventually decided the "buzzkilling" was the best one. Bragging over who came up with the winning name and the immense size of their [[e-peen]] immediately ensued. The term "buzzkilling" refers to the [[fact]] that the awkward way in which the images are narrated ruins any potential humor. It was [[trolls remorse]].

[[Some Argue|Rumour has it]] the name might derive from another deeply painful fad many [[retard|people]] seem to [[buttsecks|adore]] - namely [[Family Guy]]. One episode during yet another completely unrelated flashback involved a [[gentlemen|sophisticated]] character named <i>Buzz Killington</i> who describes unfunny pictures in an unfunny manner. Even [[Family Guy#Characters|Peter Griffin]] didn't laugh.  While this is not the actual source, and it was actually just the first thing that popped in the faggot's head, it is [[shit nobody cares about|an interesting theory]].
