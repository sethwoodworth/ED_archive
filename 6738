== Introduction ==
[http://quotebucket.org/ QuoteBucket], --''Also known as "QB"''-- is an online user-driven database which contains extracts of logs from [[IRC]] channels
and other forms of online messaging (including [[AIM]], Windows Live Messenger, [[ICQ]], [[MySpace|MySpaceIM]] and [[Yahoo|Yahoo! Messenger]]) so they can be viewed,
searched and rated by the public. It is similar to the famous [[Bash.org]].

Quotes that are often submitted are kept in a "queue" where they can be reviewed by moderators/or administrators where they will be accepted or denied
within 24 hours.

== History ==
QB launched in the month of September, 2008 (Exact day unknown) using the subdomain "quotebucket.info.tm" made available from FreeDNS,
and then in May 2009, quotebucket.org was registered. In its lifespan it has had 3 different designs, a "brown" ugly one,
quotebucket-1.0[http://quotebucket.org/themes/preview/quotebucket-1.0/], and finally the current one (including a "Bash" view).

With quote databases such as [[Bash.org]], it was obvious quotes weren't being reviewed fast enough. with over 7000 pending quotes causing a major backlog and clogging up the quote queue, this could never really be fixed unless someone reviewed a massive load of quotes in their spare time. Thus the EScriptIRC[http://escriptirc.com/] network decided to launch QB; reviewing quotes within 24 hours of their submissions (as well as accepting mostly everything in the queue, denying only spam).

== Software ==
The website uses 100% Open Source software, and is currently running Ubuntu 8.04.1 (Linux) [http://quotebucket.org/system/index.php?disp=dynamic],
Apache2, MySQL, and PHP5 (backend). It also uses QdbS[http://qdbs.org/] as the frontend with a few modifications.

== Design ==
[[Image:Quotebucketorg.png|thumb|Quotebucket web interface]]
The QB design is unique which is a gray style/duct tape method.
There is also Bashview[http://quotebucket.org] where you can have the joy of bash.org and fast reviews all in one.
They were asked: "What's the story behind the design?", Reply:
:Long story short, Eck decided it would be good to have a "duct-tape" design,,
:It symbolizes "Shut the fuck up and read".
:It's not a common design and it makes us stand out a little. It's something that makes us unique.

== Interview ==
This is an interview from IRCReport.

 <strong>Q. What in your words, is the best way to describe QuoteBucket?</strong>
 QuoteBucket enables you to browse through a collection of user submitted quotes from IRC and other IM
 services around the Internet, Similar to that of [http://bash.org/ bash.org] and [http://qdb.us/ qdb.us].

 <strong>Q. Is QuoteBucket new? And why and when did it start?</strong>
 We're fairly new, we started in September 2008, However, we used a sub domain from FreeDNS. This was
 quotebucket.info.tm, which is still active. In May 2009, quotebucket.org was registered. We started
 QuoteBucket because (no disrespect intended) one of the oldest Quote databases, Bash, was getting
 clogged, spammed, and well. ruined. We also aimed for a "sleeker" design which would bring us out of
 our shell even more.

 <strong>Q. What, in your 100% honesty, makes QuoteBucket stand out?</strong> 
 In all honesty, I'm hoping it's because of our unique design, fast reviews on all submitted quotes,
 and respect for all of our users. There is unlimited support available and we're never short of management
 to control the reviews.

 <strong>Q. Don't you think the design is a bit too much?</strong>
 Not at all, It's been verified as a Web 2.0 website, and it still doesn't need alot of bandwidth for the user
 browsing it. Because the only image it has is in the header, And even that is under 5.0 kilo bytes.
 There are no tables what-so-ever thus it works on all browsers we've tested it on. (Internet Explorer,
 Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome [...], and even terminal based browsers such as Lynx). The design
 was started from scratch and thought through carefully, There are [http://www.flickr.com/photos/eckstasy/3729145035/ "blueprints"] to prove it.

 <strong>Q. Has QuoteBucket grown?</strong>
 I would think so, Our Google rank is 3 and our Alexa rank is 1,843,799 (As of 2/Aug/2009)

 <strong>Q. There is a lot of social networking involved, Why?</strong>
 Well, That is the whole point in it. It's a quote database, not just for IRC but for other IM services too.
 But, I suppose there is Digg, AddThis and Twitter involved. On quotes you'll notice two small links
 next to the ratings. (QDigg and QShare). Clicking on QDigg submits the quote to Digg, and clicking
 on QShare opens up the [http://addthis.com/ AddThis] box, where you can browse through a list of other social bookmarking sites
 and submit the quote to.. We have two Twitter accounts. [http://twitter.com/QuoteBucket QuoteBucket] and [http://twitter.com/qbRSS qbRSS],
 The QuoteBucket account is used for updates etc, and the qbRSS is an automatic account used for the RSS feed
 for latest quotes...
 <strong>Us</strong>: <em>Wow steady on, this is turning out to be an essay.</em>

 <strong>Q. We're almost at the end, Is there anything else you would like to say?</strong>
 Yes, Firstly. I would like to thank you for asking me to do an Interview, I would also like to thank QB's users
 for keeping it stable and running, I would like to thank all of our Twitter followers, and I would also like
 to thank Jobe for keeping the development of QdbS running smoothly..
