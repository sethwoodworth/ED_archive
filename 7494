Show Bellybutton
[[Image:Bellybuttonmotivator.jpg|thumb|Hey, it could have been a whole lot worse]]
It was a dark and stormy night on [[b/|/b/]] on the [[last thursday|19th December, 2008]] when some poor, but amazingly cute, little [[CP|girl]] appeared. Possibly directed by ill-intentioned parents or alcohol-fuelled [[16 year old girl|babysitters]], she was looking for some [[Post ending in x|post ending in]] action. 

The girl showed up in a thread holding a sign saying "Post ending in 75 tells me ... [[etc]] [[etc]]". Amazingly, among a barrage of sick fucks yelling to show [[tits]] and [[pooper]], the winning post simply read "Show Bellybutton, then go to bed." Said loli delivered and then presumably went off to bed. This enraged the [[pedo]] population of [[b/|/b/]], who spent the rest of the thread requesting a ban of the user who posted the [[winnar|winning]] post and making death threats, yet made all of the other anons go "''D'awwwwww''".

On January 16th, yet another [[copypasta]] thread was posted on the mean streets of [[b|eBaumsWorld]]. While it was met with the collective groan of many [[oldfags]], one post stood out from the rest.

While initially there was an outcry of doubt and [[TITS OR GTFO|POST TITS MOM]] upon her, another faithful [[Gentlemen|gent]] uploaded another picture of our bellybutton-showing, mini-cumdumpster from a previous night, proving it to be her:
