'''''City Empires''''' is a fail-filled, faggotry ridden cesspool of a browser game. It is inhabited by [[faggots|players]] who were too stupid for ''Cyber Nations'' or too poor for ''Sim City''. The admin himself is an [[conservative|abomination who crushes free speech with an iron fist of failure]]. The admin, known as Oracomm, crushes any and all opposition to his power, and ended up provoking the already irked [[anonymous|legion]] of [[b|/b/]] into fighting dirty. The war continues, with neither side showing any signs of surrender.

==The raid begins==
[[Last Thursday]], some [[basement dweller]], banned from his [[fail|crappy, spreadsheet version of ''Sim City'' MMORPG]]. Of course, he wanted [[buttsex|revenge]] on the mods and the [[Wikipedia|power-hungry perma-virgins]] that would actually spend time in this shit-fest. To do this, he turned to [[b|/b/]], in order to try and inflict the MMORPG with some of its cancer. Unsurprisingly, /b/, seeing how easy it would be to rape the fuck out of such an unpopular corner of the internet, proceeded to draw up plans for an OMGEPIC invasion of the site. Due to the enormous [[intellectual checkmate|mental task]] of buying tanks, [[vespene gas|infrastructure]], additional [[pylons]]  and other crap, the majority of [[retards|/b/]] never caught on. Never the less, there were some [[leet|tenacious]] enough to see it through, simplifying the complex game with a [[bible|walkthrough]]. Soon after this [[shit|Google doc from god]] appeared, the anon country - <s>UME</s>  <s>[[holocaust|Ouch_Wittes]]</s>  '''[[David]]''' had [[over 9000]] times the number of members than any other country (2/3rds the entire game). Of course, Google, where anyone can search for it, is the most sensible place to host raid information.

==The plot thickens==
Pretty soon, the [[lie|pretty cool guys]] that spent all their free time on a spreadsheet ''Sim City'' MMORPG caught on to what was going on and [[mantrain|joined forces]] to expel Anonymous from their "game." Since the game protects noobs with a two day [[condom|immunity bubble]], there wasn't much fighting to be had, but gradually an all out war escalated. Interestingly enough, the recently emancipated black person got banned by the mods for stating the obvious truth that [[Jews did WTC]], and the <s>[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|only thing keeping the country up is the sheer perseverance of its members]]</s>. Utopos has proxies.

To date, the Anons have hopped nations at least twice as [[butthurt]] mods, disappointed in the [[raep]] of their [[web 2.0]]  utopia-game, banned national leader. Anon has, since then, continuously [[goatse|goatsed]] and [[CP|CP'd]] their forum, leading to a moderate amount of [[lulz]] and [[MILF|concerned mom]] type reactions. The mods, in turn, began to auto-ban anybody with a meme-themed name. The Anonempire, however, has continued to grow, using the irc user [[lesbian|UNCLE_JIM_BOB's]] knowledge of older, subtler memes that the [[furry|newfag]] administrator's advisers could never know. However, the hard [[zerg rush|thrust]] into the [[furry]] force's family jewel region, (which are rumored to be located near their [[harbl|penis]]), has sent the forces of CE fleeing in all directions.
