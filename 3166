[[4chan|4chan's]] technology board, '''/g/''' (also known as the BATTLESTATIONS!!1!-board), has increasingly become one of the more frequented boards, with [[b/|/b/]] and [[v/|/v/]] becoming more mountainous piles of [[shit]] that somehow manages to digest itself into shit<sup>2</sup>. It used to be one of the more [[serious]] boards on the site but has started to decay into a state of constant flamewarfare and OS dick waving contests, caused mostly by /b/tards and /v/irgins seeking refuge from [[moot|moot's]] faggotry.

Email to RMS sent by '''Mr_Rape''' of [[Hurrchan]].[http://www.hurrchan.net/wiki/Richard_Stallman#The%20Emails]

==/g/ [[Internet Faggotry|culture]]==

{{squote|There are two types of people on /g/. Those who are majoring in [[Engineer#Electrical|EE]], and those who are [[you|far too stupid]] to major in EE and claim they have no interest in the topic, while secretly [[fap]]ping over datasheets for [[science|Field Effect Transistors]].|'''Skunkworks''' !e1337Hykks}}

If you haven't guessed yet, the main userbase that inhabits /g/ are hyper-elitist angry [[nerds]].  Remember that permavirgin kid in high school who would never shut up about his latest Linux distribution, or how much he overclocked his processor, or his retarded libertarian views, or tell you how much he hates [[Microsoft]] and spells it with a Micro$oft? Now imagine a place where all those angsty kids meet with [[anonymity]], and BAM! you have /g/: an [[Internet tough guy]] super-nerd forum.

===OS wars===
The most common types of threads that occur on /g/ are constant battles among the three OS groups:

*'''[[Mac]] OS X users''': Annoying cult-like artfags who hail Steve Jobs, and don't know any computer skills other than drag and drop. Would gladly take out a second mortgage on their house for the next mac. These are on the bottom tier of users on /g/. Windows or Linux, BSD or Plan 9, everyone agrees that mac users are inferior specimens.

*'''[[Windows]] users''': Constantly defending their buggy spyware-ridden OS by claiming that "I never get any viruses, spyware malware, bugs or anything" which is as ridiculous a statement as saying you have never been [[Rickroll]]ed or lost [[the game]].

*'''[[Linux]] users''': Saying that Mac and Windows users are all n00bs who don't know how to use a REAL OS. These computer experts will use the most obscure Linux distribution built from scratch on <s>[[notepad]]</s> vi, not because it will do them any good but rather because its so ass-backwards to use; therefore making them HARDCORE.

*'''[[BSD]] users''': Nobody actually uses [[BSD]]; users of all OSs just like to spam it to troll everybody else and watch the ensuing [[Anger|RAGE]].

*'''[[Plan9]] users''': Nobody pays attention to Plan9 users. They can be seen trying to convince any one who doesn't use plan9 to switch so they can take advantage of "that cool networking thing."

===Vidyacard wars===

[[Image:200%2B.png|thumb|It's true, try it yourself.]]

[[Image:Woodscrewtesla.jpg|thumb|Nvidia's new card which turned out to be a nonfunctional frankencard held together with wood screws.]]

Things like 1.7%, wood screws, <s> Q1 2010</s> <s>Q2 2010</s> Q3 2010, whirring noises and other such phrases may be used while referring to Nvidia. This is due to Nvidia being a bit behind on their latest series of cards while ATI had a successful launch. Therefore it's over, Nvidia is finished.

*'''Origins of 1.7''': Charlie Demerjian, a reporter for a tech rumor site reported that Nvidia only had 1.7% yields on their latest GPU; basically, this means that for every 1000 GPUs produced, only 17 are actually functional. Hours after the original article was posted, it was discovered that this statistic was based on a Google translation of a Japanese website. /g/ then went to /jp/ to ask them to translate the text to verify if it was accurate. It ended up that the translation was incorrect and therefore the news report is false.

*'''Origins of Woodscrews''': Another meme originating from Charlie Demerjian. In November, various websites reported that NVIDIA had used a mockup of a video card in a presentation to a Technology Conference. Once Demerjian got a hold of the story through these websites (since he's banned from any press events for IRL trolling), he added his own flavor of sensationalism to the story, including the claim that it was made with woodscrews. The original article now contains an update stating they were not in fact wood screws.

*'''Origins of Pork Shoulders''': During the CES 2010 conference, when NVIDIA's CEO repeatedly kept mentioning pork shoulders.

===Headphones===
/g/eeks like to think they're [[Audiophile|audiophiles]] by saying which low-cost headphone sounds the best, i.e. if you don't get PortaPros you're a faggot. What they don't know is if they didn't spend so much [[Jew gold|money]] on their computers they could have a real sound system and not resort to cheap $30 headphones. This argument was so frequent that at one point it was suggested that /g/ be renamed to /headphones/.

===[[Desktop|Desktop Thread]]s===
/g/'s only real cancer. It mainly consists of neckbeards, [[Tidus]], 13 year olds, and raging faggots posting their latest Blink-182 wallpapers and crappy rainmeter skins. It inevitably descends into an OS/application flamewar ([[Fantard|'''LAAAAAWL U UZE FURRYFOX (LOLOLOLO) WUT A FAG I UZE SAFIREY CUZ IT IZ RLY FAST AND SAEF''']])

===Computer Builds===
The worst of /g/. Includes [[12|ten year-olds]] asking which dell pre-made their mom should buy to [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|tech-school dropouts]], with, of course, their mandatory newegg screenshot, asking whether they should go with ASUS or Gigabyte, "brah." Common quotes include: "I only have 300 bucks, but I need it to be capable of running Crysis on 4x AA, wut do I change?" and "HEY I NEED A NEW COMP OKAY?? IM THINKING OF A DELL GAMING LAPTOP WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?? MY MOM SAID I CAN ONLY SPEND 3,000 BUCKS WHAT DO I BUY???" Ultimately it's best to just ignore such threads or politely ask, "But will it run Crysis?"

===Unboxing Threads===

When you're some [[unfunny]] richfag looking to flaunt your new wares (and [[basement]]) you got for [[Hanukkah|Xmas]] to a bunch of strangers, what better place than /g/?  These ''always'' end up 50+ with any variation of the usual bullshit, '''especially''' if was an entire build.  They result in precisely 50% [[poor]]fag [[jealous|jelly]], and 50% [[OP]] butthurt over the realization he just paid $1500 for a pile of already-outdated [[Fermi|dogshit]] from newegg or ncix.  

==Trolling /g/==
[[Image:Fukkentrolled.jpg|thumb|right|Yeah, just go with the dell.]]
As if the above tidbits weren't a good enough indication, /g/ is stupidly easy to troll. A few of the ways to successfully piss the [[Neckbeard|neckbeards]] off are:

*'''Posting.''' Seriously, that's all it takes. Virtually every thread in /g/ turns into an argument with zealous fanboys of one side trying to outtype the fanboys of another.
*Make any post mentioning [[Slut|Madeline]].
*Asking why they hate Apple/Linux/FreeBSD/Windows so much.
*Mentioning that Droids are just copies of the iPhone and as such will never be as good.
*Asking about [[/v/|vidya]]
*Anything related to any programming language, especially Java.
*Telling them about your girlfriend and how alpha you are
*Saying that Stallman is a delusional coot
*>[[Implying implications|<span style="color:#00AA00">implying any and everything</span>]]
*Posting anything involving Apple or Steve Jobs
*Asking why they care so much about companies that could care less about them short of their money

[[Image:G has an issue with federal order to stop texting.png|thumb|left|120px|Obama issues an executive order for federal employees to stop texting while driving, and guess who has a problem with that? That's right, /g/.]]
Due to the abundance of libertarian faggots on /g/, any and all news about the government introducing or increasing funding to a socialized program or doing something that can be misconstrued as taking away individual rights is instant troll material. If you want a good example of this, post the following copy pasta on /g/ with a picture of Ron Paul at about 1 PM (central time zone):

|This morning I was awoken by my alarm clock powered by electricity generated by the public power monopoly regulated by the US department of energy.
I then took a shower in the clean water provided by the municipal water utility.

After that, I turned on the TV to one of the FCC regulated channels to see what the national weather service of the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration determined the weather was going to be like using satellites designed, built, and launched by the national aeronautics and space administration. I watched this while eating my breakfast of US department of agriculture inspected food and taking the drugs which have been determined as safe by the food and drug administration.

At the appropriate time as regulated by the US congress and kept accurate by the national institute of standards and technology and the US naval observatory, I get into my national highway traffic safety administration approved automobile and set out to work on the roads built by the local, state, and federal departments of transportation, possibly stopping to purchase additional fuel of a quality level determined by the environmental protection agency, using legal tender issued by the federal reserve bank. On the way out the door I deposit any mail I have to be sent out via the US postal service and drop the kids off at the public school.

Then, after spending another day not being maimed or killed at work thanks to the workplace regulations imposed by the department of labor and the occupational safety and health administration, I drive back to my house which has not burned down in my absence because of the state and local building codes and the fire marshall's inspection, and which has not been plundered of all its valuables thanks to the local police department.

I then log onto the internet which was developed by the defense advanced research projects administration and post on freerepublic and fox news forums about how SOCIALISM in medicine is BAD because the government can't do anything right.

|This morning I was awoken by my alarm clock, powered by energy generated soley by Southern California Edison and manufactured by the Sony Corporation.

I then took a shower in my house constructed by Centex Homes, sold to me by a Century 21 real estate agent, and mortgaged by Citibank.

After that, I turned on my Panasonic television which I purchased with a Washington Mutual credit card to a local NBC Corporation affiliate to see what their team of hired meteorologists forecasted the weather to be using their weather radar system.

While watching this, I ate my breakfast of eggs and bacon, both produced by a local farm and sold to me by my local grocery store, and took my prescribed medication manufactured by Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Astra-Zeneca, and Novartis.

When my Motorola-manufactured Cable Set Top Box showed the appropriate time, I got into my Toyota-manufactured Prius vehicle and set out to my graphic design workplace and stopped to purchase some gasoline refined by the Royal Dutch Shell company, using my debit card issued to me by Bank of the West. On the way to my workplace, I dropped off a package at the local UPS store for delivery, and droped my children off at a local private school.

Then, after spending another day not being maimed or killed at work thanks to the company-mandated standards enforced at my workplace, I drive back to my house which had not burned down in my absence because of the high manufacturing quality of the products inside and of the company which built my house, and which has not been plundered of all its valuables thanks to the alarm services provided by [[Brinks Home Security]]. I was able to rest easy knowing that even had this happened, I would have an Allstate insurance policy which would cover any damage to my home and anything that was stolen.

I then logged onto the internet, financed and ran in part by various different private corporations such as Google, Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon, and posted on the Huffington Post and Daily Kos about how capitalism is the source of all evil in this country.

If you followed the directions above, in about an hour you will have a troll thread with 200+ posts from all the libertarian faggots on /g/ bawing in unison. There is nothing more beautiful. And the best part is: it never fails. The last thread with this pasta (August 8th, 2009) reached 332 posts in 5 hours and 4 minutes. That's 1.1 posts per minute. <s>Incredible, no other troll on /g/ has of yet broken this record.</s> 

DISREGARD THAT. On August 18th, 2009, '''4 different threads with the above copy pasta were made''', one having 235 posts, another having 60 posts, with '''yet another''' with 25 posts, and the last one with 24 posts, totaling up to '''344 replies'''. Though, at 0.76 posts per minute over 7 hours and 28 minutes, it does not beat the speed of the last record.

This is proof that on /g/, this copypasta defies logic.

==Tripfag [[Circlejerk]]s==
[[Writing Yourself Into An Article|Stop adding yourself to this list.]]

==IRC Channels==
[[Image:Insub.jpg|thumb|An average IRC session.]]
Since no one on /g/ can get along, there are a lot of IRC channels: 
*On irc.rizon.net (Shit channels):
**&#35;r0b0tz (DEAD (thanks Tanami))
**&#35;/g/tech (you will be banned, also dead channel is dead & tripfags) "<@draker> #/g/tech is to /g/ what #/y/ is to /a/"
**&#35;/g/tv (more like /b/tv & tripfags)
**<strike>&#35;perwl (tripfags)</strike> (thanks for killing it tanami ;_;)
**&#35;desktopthread
**&#35;/g/
**&#35;GEE
**&#35;cirnos
**&#35;drakersux (lol)
**&#35;/g/oatse (also dead)
**&#35;coolface (tripfags)
**<strike>&#35;/g/loli</strike> (sparky)
**&#35;techloligy.  (pedophiles & tripfags)
Channels nobody cares about, but they still exist:
**&#35;chillbro (balloons)
*On irc.tsukihi.me (what the fuck more networks)
**&#35;hurr (sorta-idle)(tripfags)
**&#35;gentoochan (tripfags)
*On irc.9ch.in (jesus christ enough nets?)
**&#35;hades (music & srs tech discushions)

==NO MODS ON /g/==
[[Image:- 4chan_irc_mods.png|thumb|A peek into the daily life of the 4chan mods.]]
Unfortunately /g/ isn't exempt from the 4chan lifestyle. Like the other boards on 4chan, there are NO MODS ON /g/.

Due to the lack of moderation, /g/ has become a shithole. Between the [[Anontalk]] spam, the [[Lockerz]] threads, the gay porn dumps, the loli dumps, and the troll threads, /g/ is only a shell of what it once was. Once in a blue moon will you find a actual discussion about technology, however these are rare occurrences as they quickly go off topic with mentioned gay porn and loli dumps, let alone the trolls and know-nothings.

===REPORTING THREADS===
98% of the time when you report a thread using the "<u>Rule</u> Violation" option, your report will go ignored. Most reports under "Illegal Material" are quickly dealt with, but if you report something that is not illegal (EG: anything other than [[CP]]) you will be [[Banned|B&]] for abusing the report function. <i>Ironic isn't it?</i>
*The best way to report a thread is to post the offending thread in [irc://irc.rizon.net/4chan #4chan on irc.rizon.net]. Annoy the fuck out of the moderators until one acknowledges you. Moderators are the users with ~/@/%/+ in front of their name.

|I'm terribly sorry for interjecting another moment, but what I just told you is GNU/Linux is, in fact, just Linux, or as I've just now taken to calling it, Just.Linux. Linux apparently does happen to be a whole operating system unto itself and comprises a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Most computer users who run the entire Linux system every day already realize it. Through a peculiar turn of events, I was misled into calling the system "GNU/Linux", and until now, I was unaware that it is basically the Linux system, developed by the Linux project.

There really isn't a GNU/Linux, and I really wasn't using it; it is an extraneous misrepresentation of the system that's being used. Linux is the operating system: the entire system made useful by its included corelibs, shell utilities, and other vital system components. The kernel is already an integral part of the Linux operating system, never confined useless by itself; it functions coherently within the context of the complete Linux operating system. Linux is never used in combination with GNU accessories: the whole system is basically Linux without any GNU added, or Just.Linux. All the so-called "GNU/Linux" distributions are really distributions of Linux.

|Are you saying that this linux can run on a computer without windows underneath it, at all ? As in, without a boot disk, without any drivers, and without any services ?

That sounds preposterous to me.

If it were true (and I doubt it), then companies would be selling computers without a windows. This clearly is not happening, so there must be some error in your calculations. I hope you realise that windows is more than just Office ? Its a whole system that runs the computer from start to finish, and that is a very difficult thing to acheive. A lot of people dont realise this.

Microsoft just spent $9 billion and many years to create Vista, so it does not sound reasonable that some new alternative could just snap into existence overnight like that. It would take billions of dollars and a massive effort to achieve. IBM tried, and spent a huge amount of money developing OS/2 but could never keep up with Windows. Apple tried to create their own system for years, but finally gave up recently and moved to Intel and Microsoft.

Its just not possible that a freeware like the Linux could be extended to the point where it runs the entire computer from start to finish, without using some of the more critical parts of windows. Not possible.

I think you need to re-examine your assumptions.

I hope you realise that dos is more than just lotus 1-2-3 ? Its a whole system that runs the computer from start to finish, and that is a very difficult thing to acheive. A lot of people dont realise this.

Microsoft just spent $9 million and many years to create DOS 6.2, so it does not sound reasonable that some new alternative could just snap into existence overnight like that. It would take billions of dollars and a massive effort to achieve. IBM tried, and spent a huge amount of money developing OS/2 but could never keep up with DOS. Apple tried to create their own system for years, but finally gave up recently and created a shell for Unix.

the OS X variant of the Stallman copypasta
{|border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0
|I’d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re refering to as Mac OS X, is in fact, BSD/OS X, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Mac plus BSD. Mac OS X is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning BSD system made useful by the BSD corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the BSD system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of BSD which is widely used today is often called “OS X”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the BSD system, developed by the BSD Project.

There really is a Mac OS X, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Mac OS X is the UI: the program in the system that creates the pretty graphics. The UI is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Mac OS X is normally used in combination with the BSD operating system: the whole system is basically BSD with Mac OS X added, or BSD/OS X. All the so-called “Mac OS X” versions are really distributions of BSD/OS X.

===Interjection Bots===

==h4x==

On January 18th, 2011, a 1337 h4x0r posted the administrator details to the database of a school in Rhode Island.  Many lulz resulted from this, with school lunch prices set to 9000, 1 credit needed to graduate, all black kids expelled for stabbing, and a "special alert" sent to all parents containing the Stallman GNU/Linux copypasta, among many other edits.  Basically, the entire databased was anally raped.  The thread resulted in half of /g/ being banned and once again proved that /g/ is the best board on 4chan.
