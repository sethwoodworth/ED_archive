[[Google]] '''Chrome''' is one of the most lurid and shittiest [[web]] [[browser]]s known to man. It appeared [[last Thursday]] when a very funny [[webcomic]] was leaked. [[4chan]]'s /g/ and [[Something Awful]]'s SH/SC orgasmed at the release of Chrome and dubbed it the "[[Windows]] killer". Luckily Google is an advertising company so the browser will keep all of your personal data, such as what websites you visit, safe. Wink wink. Since the last [[100]] years Google never made a stable browser and every single fucking day they release a beta version full with more and more bugs. Let's say you got 7 computers in your home which every computer has 4 systems. And [[Google]] releases another beta version full with popups and bugs. For fucks sake, are you gonna install every singe beta daily on all of your computers ????

==Features==
[[Image:googlechromeicon.jpg|thumb|Chrome, I choose you! [[Some argue]] that it is in fact the Metroid logo with Samus in her ball.]]
[[File:GoogleMalware.png|thumb|Google Chrome thinks that Google.com is [[malware]], and they are correct!]]
===Multithreading===
The main feature of the browser is that it starts a new process for each tab opened to save internet spaces. This extends to advertisements, where all advertisements on a tab are opened in a new tab and the one you were viewing is closed. This is so you can view the advertisements with maximum pleasure and without being distracted by all that content on /b/. 
* The browser incorporates many unique privacy elements such as direct transfer of your private data to the government for protection. Chrome has proven itself so fast that  [[Comcast]] is now throttling the speeds of Chrome and Windows Anti Virus 2008 classifies it as a virus.
===Colorful Design And Theme Faggotry===
* Google powers it with copyright infringement; they made special [[Pokemon|Pokeballs]] to capture [[Shit nobody cares about|rare and valuable Pokemon like Metagross, whose brain is as powerful as four supercomputers]].  The Pokemon are used to power the browser as they slowly sap the life force from your computer.
* Chrome supports themes that won't fuck your browser up.
===Safety===
* Even worse, when you run Chrome and browse [[ED]] under Windows, you don't get the [[Lie|helpful ]] Window/XP/WhateverDefender application installed under your machine's "Documents and Settings" folder and in your registry's "what to do with exe's" instructions that so enrich the Firefox and IE experiences.
* Chrome evaded the XSS attacks by [[Goatse Security]].
===Drag Drop===
It has some key differences from [[Firefox]], like being able to drag tabs into separate windows (which Firefox can now do and [[Opera]] could always do) and that's about it.  However, because it is made by Google, everyone overlooks the complete irrelevance of this browser.
===Extensions===
Google has an app store which has thousands of extensions. Among thousands, only 10 of them are useful for you. Extensions help you not to see ads, get 1 year weather forecast, see your daily horoscope, be spammed by your recent emails, etc.

==Why you should switch==
[[Image:chromecentipedes.png|thumb|Google is on the case.]]
*Because [[Firefox 3]] is complete shit. (especially sucks when draws a circle around the item you click on.)
*[[Open source]]
*Because [[nobody cares]] about [[goatse|rainbow blinkies]] anyway
*Omnibar 
*Beta = [[Leet]] [[Hacker]]
*Help [[Google]] take over the world
*More [[ads]]
*Increases your ram speed by 1 gigabyte
*Who need's privacy?
*[[Xtreme|XTREME]] SPEEDS
*Resembles Pokeball
*It prevents teh [[Mudkip|mukdipz]] from taking over your browser:

*Incognito Mode [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|DELETES]] YOUR [[IP address|IP ADDRESS]] and lets you look at pr0n without [[you|your]] mom finding out:

==The Jewish Takeover, a [[moron|taxi driver]] writes==

Prior to [[9/11]] the [[Jews]] were conspiring to take over the internet in an operation known only as [[Web 2.0]]. It was devolved in early 2000 as a predecessor to [[Jewtube|YouTube]]. However Netscape navigator proved to be to much of an opponent and Chrome was canceled. Use extreme caution while using Chrome as it is believed to emit mind-controlling radio waves to make you buy flu shots.

== Fork ==
Some people didn't quite like the way Chrome's icon looked like. So they downloaded the source and painted the icon blue. Hence cometh [http://code.google.com/chromium/?hl=en Chromium].
