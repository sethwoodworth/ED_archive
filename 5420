Mircea Kitsune
Mircea Kitsune, going under the forum name Taoki, is an 18 year old [[shemale|transgendered]] [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[furry]] [[otherkin]] [[vore|voraphile]] who is [[butthurt]] over [[nazi|Linden Labs]], creators of the [[shit|popular]] [[porn|online game]] [[Second Life]], making a [http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/09/18/identity-verification-and-flagging-parcels-for-restricted-content/ recent decision] to resrtict [[13 year old boy|teenagers]] from the Main Grid, taking away his jerk off material. Mircea decided that the [[ban|banning]] of minors from the porn infested Main grid was as great an affront as black person being forced to [[In the ass|sit at the back of the bus]] and started an online movement to protest the decision.

==A Moral Outrage==
Taking the matter [[masturbation|into his own hands]], Mircea posted his [[tl;dr]] plea for [[rape|help]] on the [http://forums.secondlife.com/ Second Life forums], [http://mircea-kitsune.livejournal.com/3677.html his Livejournal], and [http://furnation.com/index.php?showtopic=15176 FurNation's message board], along with an [[image macro]].

In his presented argument, which reeks of [[butthurt]] and [[fursecution]], Mircea views the recent decision by Linden Labs as a form of persecution similar to what black person faced in the 1950s on the bus or what [[Tom Cruise|midgets]] face today in restaurants. In short, it is advisable that Mircea become [[an hero]] for his cause, much like [[Malcolm X]] or Bridget "the Midget" Power.

In further acts of [[faggotry]], when a forum member pointed out the [[American]] laws about minors accessing [[pornography]] in the [[Pedobear|Child Online Protection Act]] Mircea goes on to bash [[America]] for no particular reason, most likely [[furry|scapegoating]] it as the reason underage folk can't access porn on Second Life, and claims it is worse than all the [[Arab|Arabic]] nations combined. In another post he claims that porn is a civil right. [[WTF]]??
