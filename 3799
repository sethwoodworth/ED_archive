Humane weapons
[[image:Genesis_humane_weapons.jpg|thumb|An artists interpretation of what Genesis/Humane Weapons looks like.]]
'''Humane Weapons''' is an internet [[troll]] of the completely retarded variety. (What other kind is there?) He originally got his [[AOL]] address posted in a [[7chan]] invasion thread. Many /i/nvaders spammed his account with [[mudkips]] and [[desu]]. He retaliated after these attacks by making empty threats and lame insults to [[Anonymous]]. He blocks the /i/nvader before he gets too [[pwned]] and then he makes a lame post on 7chan about how he won. He has a habit of quoting and making references to Star Wars.

Humane also uses the handle "Leader of Fate".

==Summary of a Conversation with Humane Weapons==
''Humane weapons: You suck.<br />
/i/fag: how do i shot web?<br />
Humane weapons: I'm better than you.<br />
Humane weapons signed off at 5:42:12 PM''


==Humane Weapons Calls to Invasion==
After Humane Weapons got totally [[pwned]] by Anonymous, he tried to call an invasion of his own.

''My name is Humane weapons, you may call me Genesis if it pleases you. As I can see, I have scattered, and killed all of your confidence in a few conversations, and made a very large thread based off a small conversation. The world now is watching how I single handedly took down each of you, or most of you. If any of you are left that have the balls to challenge me, then I beg that you attempt to try. However, the reason I did this was in fact not for chix0r, or 4chan. I did this more or less to prove that it only takes one person to bring you down. So I ask that all who read this, all who hate 7chan, and it's /i/ join me in a raid. A raid to be remembered. I ask that together, we all do as they have done to us. That on the 14th of October, we raid the /b/ forums of 7chan, and give them something to remember. A scar that will never heal, and forever be remembered. In order to prove I am in fact Humane weapons or Genesis. I will post this on my lastmeasure site. Code named.
<br />

<br />
This is our chance to strike back, and teach them a lesson. I ask that everyone join me, for a day that 7chan will NEVER forget.
<br />
Genesis...''

Humane Weapons attempted to call the enemies of 7chan together to try and invade /b/. As we all know, invading /b/ is like pissing into an [[Europe|ocean of piss]]. This shows how much of a failure he really is.

==Humane Weapons and Shiahgo==
A [[Jewish]] namefag known as Shiahgo made himself known on /i/ [[at least 100 years ago]]. He quickly turned into a [[camwhore]] who thought he had status among Anonymous. In December he claimed to be raided by Humane Weapons and started an AIM war against Humane. This ended as Shiahgo confessed to being Humane Weapons because he is an [[attention whore]]. He never ceases to lie and has called into [[Hal Turner]]'s show claiming to be a mod of 7chan, "tight" with ian, is mentioned in Hal's [[lolsuit]] with his real name claiming to be a moderator of eBaumsworld. Shiahgo is a [[lulz]] killer and needs to get back in the oven.

/i/ vowed never to let namefags take control of raids because Anonymous is legion.

==Humane Weapons' Real Identity==
Humane Weapons (Shiahgo) is actually a 19-year-old boy by the name of Joseph Bernert. He used to spend his time on a shitty RuneScape fansite (RuneHQ) forum, and was considered popular there. He spread lies about his "girlfriend", who had apparently become an hero.

Other members of the site called bullshit after a while, and Joey realized he was close to losing his e-penis. He rallied his "friends" and attempted to take down the several thousand-member forum. His plans failed, of course, but he convinced himself he had won.

Some time during this, he began to consider himself a /b/tard, and his e-penis grew to critical mass. 

His [[MySpace]] can be found here: http://www.myspace.com/jbernert, and his Stickam can be found here: http://www.stickam.com/profile/shiahgo

His [[Facebook]] can be found here: http://www.facebook.com/jbernert; he updates it all the fucking time.

==FUCKING LONG LOG==
A log of a conversation between him and another RuneScape [[faggot]]:

[1/28/2007 9:21:13 PM] Shatterias says: [[lulz]].

[1/28/2007 9:21:16 PM] Shatterias says: A /b/tard [[wannabe]].

[1/28/2007 9:21:24 PM] Shatterias says: [[4ailchan]] haha.

[1/28/2007 9:21:52 PM] Garrett says: Kill RuneHQ or whatever you wanna do. I don't really care or believe that you can do whatever you want to...

[1/28/2007 9:21:57 PM] Shatterias says: [[Lol]].

[1/28/2007 9:22:04 PM] Shatterias says: You don't know me, or who I am do you?

[1/28/2007 9:22:13 PM] Shatterias says: I lead a [[raid]] inwhich we got someone to [[kill themselves]].

[1/28/2007 9:22:25 PM] Garrett says: Then kill whoever you want.

[1/28/2007 9:22:26 PM] Shatterias says: Her name was Katie Mconell.

[1/28/2007 9:22:31 PM] Garrett says: Don't let me stop you.

[1/28/2007 9:22:35 PM] Shatterias says: Oh not at all.

[1/28/2007 9:22:43 PM] Shatterias says: Just you becoming /b/tards will be a mistake.

[1/28/2007 9:23:02 PM] Shatterias says: Rest assured [[mudkips]], [[desu]], [[4ailchan]], and [[grinman]] is just a few [[memes]].

[1/28/2007 9:24:13 PM] Shatterias says: And if you dare try to oppose me, I will see to it directly that I pay [[moots]], and Ian off to have you, and anyone else that I find from HQ [[banned]].

[1/28/2007 9:24:30 PM] Garrett says: Go ahead.

[1/28/2007 9:24:35 PM] Garrett says: Do it. Now.

[1/28/2007 9:24:39 PM] Shatterias says: Good, I'm glad you get my point.

[1/28/2007 9:24:45 PM] Shatterias says: You're no threat right now.

[1/28/2007 9:24:58 PM] Garrett says: Get me banned from RuneHQ.

[1/28/2007 9:25:00 PM] Garrett says: Do it.

[1/28/2007 9:25:01 PM] Shatterias says: You don't even know what desu is. So I don't care.

[1/28/2007 9:25:02 PM] Shatterias says: HQ?

[1/28/2007 9:25:04 PM] Shatterias says: No no no.

[1/28/2007 9:25:05 PM] Shatterias says: 4chan.

[1/28/2007 9:25:09 PM] Shatterias says: [[12chan]].

[1/28/2007 9:25:14 PM] Shatterias says: [[420chan]].

[1/28/2007 9:25:15 PM] Garrett says: I don't even go on those sites.

[1/28/2007 9:25:19 PM] Garrett says: I'm not registered or anything.

[1/28/2007 9:25:23 PM] Shatterias says: Well let [[Faggot]] know.

[1/28/2007 9:25:38 PM] Shatterias says: It would save me thr trouble of having to dig up Kevin.

[1/28/2007 9:25:52 PM] Shatterias says: Same with Ruby, Nido, [[Kitten]], and Nathan haha.

[1/28/2007 9:26:14 PM] Shatterias says: Besides I have Nathans home address, and with Ian I can get full fledged phone raid.

[1/28/2007 9:26:40 PM] Shatterias says: So let your little cohorts know that if they get in my way, I will personally rip them new assholes.

[1/28/2007 9:26:48 PM] Garrett says: Then do it.

[1/28/2007 9:26:51 PM] Shatterias says: Clorissa has seen my raids, and witnessed exactly what 'm capable of.

[1/28/2007 9:27:04 PM] Shatterias says: As I said before, you're no threat.

[1/28/2007 9:27:29 PM] Garrett says: No, Joey, I know you're no threat.

[1/28/2007 9:27:41 PM] Shatterias says: Nathan took it so badly that he made a webpage after me, you realize that that gave me a background?

[1/28/2007 9:27:54 PM] Shatterias says: Do you understand that people at the [[chans]] love that?

[1/28/2007 9:28:14 PM] Garrett says: You've always done this. You've pumped yourself full of everything that could possibly have me come to harm. You've told me everything that might possibly scare me, ever.

[1/28/2007 9:28:26 PM] Shatterias says: I'm not going to do anything unless I have to.

[1/28/2007 9:28:31 PM] Garrett says: I've given up believing what you say. I don't care.

[1/28/2007 9:28:36 PM] Shatterias says: Good.

[1/28/2007 9:28:42 PM] Shatterias says: Then you'll steer clear.

[1/28/2007 9:28:43 PM] Garrett says: And I don't care to talk to you unless it's you saying much about me.

[1/28/2007 9:28:58 PM] Garrett says: Do whatever you have to do to scare me, but let me tell you it won't work.

[1/28/2007 9:29:04 PM] Shatterias says: I'm not here to scare.

[1/28/2007 9:29:09 PM] Shatterias says: I'm here to warn you.

[1/28/2007 9:29:33 PM] Garrett says: I believe that all the power you have is possibly Nate's [[dox|phone number]] and there's hardly anything you can do with that because nobody is dedicated to you enough to do anything with it.

[1/28/2007 9:29:41 PM] Shatterias says: LOLOLOL

[1/28/2007 9:29:42 PM] Garrett says: Besides, a few number blocks and Nate's done.

[1/28/2007 9:29:48 PM] Shatterias says: Clorissa. Tell him who I am.

[1/28/2007 9:29:59 PM] Shatterias says: Tell him about [[Myspace]], [[Da]], and Hal Turner.

[1/28/2007 9:30:08 PM] Garrett says: You're Shatterias of the chans, beholder of mighty internet empires! Behold!

[1/28/2007 9:30:47 PM] Shatterias says: Shatterias?

[1/28/2007 9:30:49 PM] Shatterias says: No no no.

[1/28/2007 9:31:07 PM] Shatterias says: This is an alias, as long you don't know my chan name, then you're nothing.

[1/28/2007 9:31:14 PM] Shatterias says: Even if Clorissa told you.

[1/28/2007 9:31:19 PM] Garrett says: You're the immortal Shiago.

[1/28/2007 9:31:20 PM] Shatterias says: You still couldn't hurt me.

[1/28/2007 9:31:23 PM] Shatterias says: Shiahgo*

[1/28/2007 9:31:25 PM] Shatterias says: Get it right.

[1/28/2007 9:31:47 PM] Garrett says: I can't stop laughing...

[1/28/2007 9:31:52 PM] Shatterias says: Haha.

[1/28/2007 9:31:54 PM] Garrett says: Okay, I stopped.

[1/28/2007 9:32:28 PM] Shatterias says: I must say though. I learned a few things in the past 5 monthes.

[1/28/2007 9:32:53 PM] Garrett says: That [[nobody cares]] any more?

[1/28/2007 9:33:17 PM] Garrett says: That you've done all you can do and that you've moved on to bother others?

[1/28/2007 9:33:31 PM] Shatterias says: No no.

[1/28/2007 9:34:04 PM] Garrett says: That you've just been trying to pick up the pieces of your proverbial shattered RHQ life and throw it in our faces, only to have those pieces flung back at you tenfold?

[1/28/2007 9:34:10 PM] Shatterias says: Not at all.

[1/28/2007 9:34:12 PM] Garrett says: Please.

[1/28/2007 9:34:13 PM] Shatterias says: HQ is dead.

[1/28/2007 9:34:18 PM] Shatterias says: I don't [[lie]] anymore anyways.

[1/28/2007 9:34:18 PM] Garrett says: I'm not scared of you.

[1/28/2007 9:34:25 PM] Shatterias says: Haha.

[1/28/2007 9:34:39 PM] Shatterias says: It makes you swell somewhere that I have this power.

[1/28/2007 9:34:59 PM] Garrett says: You're no genius. You're a [[16-year-old]] with lots of time to spare, so you decide to bother others over the internet.

[1/28/2007 9:35:13 PM] Garrett says: And you've yet to show me power. :)

[1/28/2007 9:35:17 PM] Shatterias says: Well it's serious business when people kill themselves over myspace.

[1/28/2007 9:35:22 PM] Garrett says: I've heard phone raids and stuff.

[1/28/2007 9:35:30 PM] Shatterias says: You've heard of [[Hal Turner]]?

[1/28/2007 9:35:31 PM] Garrett says: She was probably depressed and did it for most other reasons.

[1/28/2007 9:35:35 PM] Shatterias says: LOL.

[1/28/2007 9:35:45 PM] Garrett says: No, I haven't heard of Hal Turner. Mind informing me of him?

[1/28/2007 9:35:45 PM] Shatterias says: We attacked her for ten days straight, her and her friends.

[1/28/2007 9:35:52 PM] Shatterias says: Go ahead, and look him up.

[1/28/2007 9:36:03 PM] Shatterias says: Sides, it's just for the lulz.

[1/28/2007 9:36:04 PM] Garrett says: No, no, I'll let you tell me.

[1/28/2007 9:36:18 PM] Shatterias says: I insist you look it up, as you don't trust me.

[1/28/2007 9:36:30 PM] Shatterias says: 4chan is worthless, and full of [[AIDS]], and [[CP]].

[1/28/2007 9:37:00 PM] Garrett says: I've got a lot of Hals, which one?

[1/28/2007 9:37:01 PM] Clorissa says: [[Pool's closed|CLOSE THEM POOLS]]

[1/28/2007 9:37:06 PM] Shatterias says: Turner.

[1/28/2007 9:37:07 PM] Garrett says: The [[pirate]] one or the gay one?

[1/28/2007 9:37:27 PM] Shatterias says: You're an idiot. You never cease to amaze me.

[1/28/2007 9:37:42 PM] Shatterias says: Anyways I have shit to do, look Hal up.

[1/28/2007 9:37:55 PM] Garrett says: There are 11 results for Hal Turner.

[1/28/2007 9:38:03 PM] Shatterias says: www.Halturnershow.com

[1/28/2007 9:38:29 PM] Garrett says: Server not found.

[1/28/2007 9:38:42 PM] Shatterias says: Ah the [[DoS]] attacked kicked in.

[1/28/2007 9:38:54 PM] Shatterias says: http://www.halturnershow.blogspot.com/

[1/28/2007 9:39:39 PM] Shatterias says: My [[IP]] is listed.

[1/28/2007 9:45:16 PM] Garrett says: I can't get to it.

[1/28/2007 9:45:41 PM] Garrett says: First page: CONTENT WARNING! I clicked "I understand" and it sent me to the main page of the site.

[[tl;dr]]. Joey believes he was a [[Unwarranted self-importance|major contributor]] in the Hal Turner raid, amongst others.

To this day, no one is sure of where he [[lurk]]s. It's most likely [[7chan]].

This conversation in short: He's [[gay]].
