The IMDb Politics Board
[[Image: Brianpeppers.jpgâ€Ž|thumb|right|Politics Board user making a point.]]

A forum where [[Idiot|intellectuals]] meet and discuss politics and [[shit]]. Generally populated by [[liberal|liberals]], [[conservative|conservatives]], and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]]- all of whom are [[retard|retards]]. Since at least [[last Thursday]], it's been a good place to get your mind [[buttsecks|buttraped]]. Just like in [[IRL|real life]], the users debate using [[bullshit|logic]] and [[Liar|facts]]. As its name would suggest, discussions vary from [[Loser|'post your pic']], to [[13-year-old boy|13 year old boys]] chasing [[Pedophilia|30 year old men]] posing as [[Wimmins|19 year old girls]], to [[e-popular|call out]] threads. [[Eurotrash|Europeans]] and [[canada|Canadians]] whine that their two countries aren't discussed, but [[no one cares]].

== The Board ==
[[at least 100 years ago|At least one hundred]] years ago [[Socrates]] invented [[Trolling IRL|IRL trolling]]. The modern day successors to Socrates, [[Sean Hannity|Hannity]] and [[Keith Olbermann|Olbermann]], have taught IMDb Politics Board users how to voice their opinions. As a result, users are [[stupid|well versed]] in [[Completely irrelevant history|contemporary events]] and can [[Liar|write eloquently]] about them. Users routinely refer to each other in complimentary terms like "[[loser]]" and "[[cocksucker]]". Because most users are [[13-year-old boy|Hannah Montana fans]], they can't read anything longer than [[TL;DR|6 word text message]]. So keep your posts to no more than one words.

For [[at least 100 years ago|at least five years]] no one has discussed [[Palestine]], [[Health Care Rage|health care]], or any other [[Afghanistan|boring shit]]. If that's what you thought a politics forum was about then [[GTFO]]. The user base (5 IRL people, plus 100 [[socks]]) spend 24/7 discussing [[nonsense|random shit]] and sucking each other's [[E-penis|cocks]].

When this page came to the [[what?|attention]] of the Board's users, it was immediately [[raped|inundated]] in typical IMDb Politics Board fashion: [[e-popular|A list]] of [[Basement-dweller|frequent Board users]] was drafted, with [[fail|witty]] blurbs describing each. An [[Edit war|edit war]] ensued and this page became a [[Japan|weapon of mass destruction]] as users tried to [[e-penis|one-up]] each other.

== The Great [[fag|JeremyGrimaldi]] Suicide "Attempt" ==

Early in 2010, a [[Gay|prolific]] regular named Jeremy_Grimaldi caused a furor by posting a [[An_hero|suicide note]] in his profile. [[Some_argue|Many believed]] that [[drama|Jeremy was actually planning on killing himself]]. These people are morons. He reappeared the next day, and the [[idiots|people who had been calling his local police department]] were really ripshit cheesed off. Here is his note:

[[tl;dr|"Someone is reading my last words. Are you s stranger who has curiosity about me? Are you a friend who is wondering where I have gone? I don't suppose it really matters at this point. I have taken stock of my life and have decided to be realistic about that life. It's not worth it. I had a bad start. No father. A mother who made it known of how little importance I played in her life. A stepfather who either ignored me or beat me. I've tried to overcome those things. I have tried to overcome my loneliness and depression. I've tried for years to examine my attempt at suicide and to be happy that attempt failed. I have wasted a lot of years trying to force myself to be happy. I am so tired, so very tired. I give. I'm beaten. I'm tired of fooling myself. Today is the day that I face reality and do what needs to be done. It'll be quick and painless. I won't fail this time. 

To EG and KR: I thank you for all you tried to do. I thank you for stepping in as a sort of substitute family. Had I known people like you, my life my have taken a different path. I thought of both of you as my friends and buddies. I foolishly thought of you as a father and a brother. It's odd the lengths that I will go to in order to make myself feel connected, to feel a part of something but I am tired of lying to myself. I am not a part of anything important, anything real. I should have been jettisoned years ago but nature does slip up, doesn't it? Anyway, I want you to know that I think the world of you both and I thank you for trying to help a stranger. I wish we had not met electronically but we did. I would have loved to have been friends with you in real life. It would have great to hang out, see a movie or have a beer at a quiet bar. 

To Siam: I cannot think of adequate words to describe how much I think of you. I don't believe I have ever had the fortune to meet someone who possessed the extreme kindness, sweetness and thoughtfulness that I've seen in you. You are aware of how much I think of you so perhaps this is overkill. This I will say: I have so much hope for you and your upcoming possibilities. I won't be able to dance at your wedding but perhaps I will be there in spirit. Who knows what is coming next? I certainly don't but, if it's possible, I will be there. Jeremy would be a cool name for a son if you ever have one. It would be great if there was a happy Jeremy running around this world and I do think you could make him happy. 

To any of those who detested me: You're in luck, I guess? I will be out of your way very shortly. 

To those of you who liked me: 
I am replaceable and there will be another along soon to take my place. 

Jeremy Bryant Grimaldi 

November 4, 1982 - January 11, 2010"]]

== How to Troll ==
[[Image: IMDb PoliticsBoard.jpg|thumb|right|The Politics Board is home to smart debate.]]
* Repeatedly demand for proof of Obama's US citizenship.
* Say that the Federal Reserve is important to US economic stability. Libertarians will rage. Repeat for [[lulz]].
* If a user criticizes Obama, call them a racist.
* Place "Hey LIBS!" in the subject heading.
* For quick and easy [[lulz]] mention abortion, gay rights, or race. Any stance will do.
* Feign frustration that no one is as informed or as smart as you.
* Pretend to [[Mitchell Henderson|lose your iPod]].
* Stalk posters.
* Say "The problem with_______ is that they have so much blood on their hands." Insert any religion into the blank.
* Start a thread calling Americans fat & stupid or Europeans fags & wimps.  Works every time.
* Put 'anal sex' in the thread title.  Lots of butt fuckers will swoop in for serious [[lulz]].
