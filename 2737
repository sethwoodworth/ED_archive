Every Topic In The Universe Except Chickens

Every Topic In The Universe Except Chickens is a serious study about the problem of vandalism on [[wiki]]s. It's main focus is [[Wikipedia]], the free online encyclopedia that aims to bring the sum of all knowledge to starving girls in Africa.

And unlike other in-depth studies of this subject, the [[virgin|author]] actually puts forward a perfectly valid solution: Only allow vandalism in the article on chickens. Compared with the myriad of processes and tools currently used to [[the man|police]] the vandalism, this is a solution that is so simple, even the [[Chronic Troll Syndrome|chronic trolls]] will be happy to join in. Hell, some [[Capitalism|Capitalist]] [[Pig]] could even figure out a way to make money from it.

Of course, even with the backing of [[Jimbo Wales|Fictional Jimbo Wales]], the [[Wikipedos]] never went along with this idea, and thus, not only is this incredibly simple solution ignored, but the chicken article is semi-protected. That's what you get for suggesting a good idea to [[Wikipedia]].

From the site:

"[[basement dweller|Friends]], this goal is within reach. I give you a new [[Wikipedia]]. A Wikipedia evolved, a Wikipedia that lives in the here in the real world. A Wikipedia that makes just one [[goatse|tiny concession]] to vandals, a concession for the greater good. I give you Wikipedia 2.0, otherwise known as Wikipedia: Every Topic In The Universe, Except Chickens (Dot Com)."
