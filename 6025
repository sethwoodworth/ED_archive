Open mic
What happens when your local [[hippies|hippie]] coffee bar (would you give a liquor license to a stoner?) installs a PA.  Only [[crap|badness]] occurs. Like the internet, Open Mic night is serious fucking business. Nothing good will ever come from open mic night. Especially at comedy clubs.

Many horrible things can happen. Here's a short list:

*Poetry reading
*Shitty indie bands playing
*Unfunny faggots with names like "Howard" making jokes about "frozen lavatory waste"
*Bongo playing
*Jerry Seinfeld
*White Australians playing the didgeridoo and trying to convince fat Americans that it's somehow [[Bullshit|cool]].
