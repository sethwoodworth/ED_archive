'''Cometstyles''' ([[IRC]] nicks - WaRpAtH, Gambit) is a [[India|Indo-Fijian]] [[Wikipedia]] editor who is very happy to abuse op powers on [[IRC]] channel. He is also a bureaucrat on Meta, wiki that acts as a control panel for all of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]’s wikis.

==About==
[[Image:Test Wiki pwnt2.PNG|thumb|left|Cometstyles goes [[batshit insane]].]]
Cometstyles was born on December 29, 1985,[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Wikimedians_by_birthday&diff=762005&oldid=756818 ][http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=WikiMen&diff=837182&oldid=672826] to an Indian family on the island of Fiji. He would start his Wikipedia career twenty-one years later in November 2006, writing unimportant crap about rugby. He got involved with Wikia later but was rejected after he started [[butthurt|complaining]] about his failed requests for adminship. Having failed two requests on Wikipedia, and since all the other editors find his [[engrish]] distasteful, he is forced to spend his time on the wiki reverting vandalism like [[NawlinWiki]].

He also enjoys making little [[boy]]s cry in far reaches of the [[Internet]] and getting [[butt-hurt]] by [[Grawp]]; one of his fantasies is to block all little boys from IRC channels, so they have nothing to do. When he isn’t on the Internet, WaRpAtH loves to watch [[movies]] like “Inglorious Bastards,” mostly because he is one. He has has strange beliefs, including [[old]] Egyptian folklore, and he loves opening old tombs containing mummies and [[fapping]] off to what he finds there. He has self-loathing issues, finding enjoyment singing songs that he [[hate]]s while in the shower and fapping off to pics of [[your mom]].

Furthermore, he cannot spell or use correct grammar even if his life depended on it.

He committed a fake [[wikicide]] in February 2009 and [[Quitting IRC forever|deleted his xchat]] because he was denied the [[Delicious cake|steward flag]]. However, he is still editing under the name "[[Wikipedia:Warpath|Warpath]]," a typical Wikipedo strategy of temporarily quitting but quickly coming [[Slavery|back for more]].

Cometstyles was also present on [[Wikia]], where he [http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Wikia:RfA/Cometstyles whined] some more because he wasn't made an administrator.
