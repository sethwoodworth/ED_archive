'''''Sailor Moon''''' is a classic [[animu|anime]], meaning that it features [[Pantyshot|schoolgirls]], [[rape]], and enormous fire spouting [[cock|penises]] destroying Tokyo. The first of a series, it revolves around the legend of a [[homosexual|"superfiend"]] that attempts to unite the three realms (Human, [[Chris-chan|Beast]], and Demon.) Director/Screenwriter Hideki Takayama brought many important modern [[Japan|Japanese]] cultural [[memes]] and motivations to this film, namely schoolgirls, rape, and enormous fire spouting penises destroying Tokyo. Thus, it is no surprise that the series was a worldwide hit, especially with [[16 year old girl|young girls]] and [[ghey|fags]].

There are five seasons; each new season features a new group of nut job villains who suck at their jobs. As the show progresses it gets stranger and stranger but still manages to deliver the odd [[pantyshot]] every second episode. By the end of the series, three [[shemale|shemales]] come in to help save the day, because everyone knows shemales [[pwn]].

==Main Characters==
[[over 9000|There are many]] [[shit nobody cares about|interesting characters]] that you should already know them by now..
<div style="height:400px; overflow:scroll;">
[[Image:Satcosplay sm.jpg|thumb|Watch! Sailor Moon is gonna cast her WTFBBQKTHXBYE!]]
[[Image:Screamingsailormoonmeme.jpg|thumb|Serena spots a negro in her kingdom.]]

* '''Tsukino Usagi (Sailor Moon)''': The [[angst|cry-baby]] [[attention whore]]. Always desperate for Tuxedo Kamen's cock, which she is destined to be impregnated by to spawn Chibi Usa. In early episodes, she used her gold-plated metal tiara as a Frisbee to gruesomely decapitate monsters. Since this was too violent for a kids show, she was later given various types of magic wands that served no purpose other than [[Masturbation|masturbatory]] devices.

* '''Chiba Mamoru (Tuxedo Kamen)''': The [[bishounen]] [[douchebag|in a tuxedo]]. Always there to save Moon and friends but never sticks around to fulfill their lustful desires.  Likely a [[homosexual]] (like half of the male cast) who is disappointed they're not real sailors.  His deadly rose attack can instantly level ten city blocks and completely destroyed Tokyo in numerous episodes.  The show would end a lot sooner if Tuxedo Mask would just show up in the beginning, say his speech about love and shit and then destroy Neo-Tokyo with a single $4 rose he bought at some gas station, but no such luck.

* '''Mizuno Ami (Sailor Mercury)''': The [[nerd]] of the group.  The most popular character among desperate fanboys who point to her own research which proved that she has the tightest pussy in the universe.  Her attack is the weakest since it only creates thick fog that results in multiple traffic accidents.  Her strength was demonstrated when she survived a 24hr chess match while fully frozen but without losing a limb to frostbite, proving that she is [[lie|hardcoar]].

[[Image:Chad_Holdenford.png|thumb|left|Whatever happened to this guy, he was awesome.]]

* '''Hino Rei (Sailor Mars)''': The [[wicca|priestess]] and [[bitch]] of the group.  Aside from bitch slapping Usagi and dating her boyfriend (whom she really did have first), she likes to throw her used tampons at monsters, which she at times also sets on fire.  Her school uniform has the shortest skirt and thus proves she is a [[slut]]. When she's not being a whore she's practicing [[wiccan|witchcraft]], proving that she is, in fact, a [[white people|white person]] and not an [[azn]].

* '''Kino Makoto (Sailor Jupiter)''': The [[drama queen]] [[attention whore]] who's always looking for a guy, only to be disappointed that he reminds her of someone she's already had sex with. In one episode, she stated that her breasts are bigger than the planet Jupiter itself. This has been recently verified by NASA [[science|scientists]] as fact. The only thing Sailor Jupiter contributes to the plotline is that she wears green clothing, balancing out the other costumes, color-wise.

* '''Aino Minako (Sailor Venus'''): The [[slut]] who engages in the more traditional activities of Japanese schoolgirls, such as selling her used panties.  Likely into [[bestiality]], she likes to tease her cat guardian Artemis by prancing around in her underwear.  Her "Love Me" chain attack is crucial in making monsters routinely rape her instead of innocent bystanders.  She is one of the biggest blond [[whore]]s in the group, second only to Usagi.

* '''Chibi Usa (Sailor Chibi Moon)''': The annoying [[fucktard]]/obligatory [[loli]].  During one season of the series, she maintained a healthy and romantic relationship with a horse. [[SRSLY]] During another season of the series we discover that, fucking-gasp, she is actually Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Masks' child from ''teh future''! This was established  '''BEFORE''' the pink [[Wikipedia:Electra complex|'''Electra''']] is magically changed into an evil sex-crazed adult for a few episodes. During that time she took Tuxedo Mask captive and repeatedly tried to rape him. No joke.  But seeing as [[incest]] is one of the main angles of the show, fans were ready to forgive, and those who weren't [[incest]] [[fetish]] [[pedophile]]s were ready to forget.

* '''Meiou Setsuna (Sailor Pluto)''': The [[emo]] one.  She didn't get much screen time due to critics denouncing her appearance as "too old" and thus causing many otakus to lose their erections whenever she was on screen.  Her control of time is often blamed for reruns and those annoying review episodes.  She was kicked out of the Sailor Moon Club and started making guest appearances on [[Power Rangers]] to pay the bills. Has fallen into massive depression after finding out that Pluto is no longer a planet, last seen at all-you-can-eat buffets, claiming that she's "Working on regaining her previous title", suffice it to say, she has lost her [[Batshit insane|mind]].

* '''Tenoh Haruka (Sailor Uranus)''': The bull [[dyke]] for which everyone was horny until they found out she was a bull dyke and drove without a license.  Her earthquake attack made her the subject of [[CIA]] investigation following the collapse of the [[911|Twin Towers]].  However, her surveillance only resulted in the creation of much [[lesbian]] [[porn]] that was subsequently sold online to help [[Bush]] finance the [[Iraq]] war. But even those must have sucked because the country is still in debt.

* '''Kaioh Michiru (Sailor Neptune)''': The bull dyke's [[lesbian|girlfriend]], [[art school]] drop-out and fan of [[piss|watersports]].  She is a wanted war-criminal due to the numerous tsunami caused by her attacks.  She is blamed for destroying Sri Lanka and is now working underground as a [[loli]] artist. Her power is "the sea", apparently ignorant of the fact that Sailor Mercury had the idea first.

* '''Tomoe Hotaru (Sailor Saturn)''': The almost-loli [[goth]] who had a secret crush on true-loli Chibi Usa.  Her weapon is a giant can opener with which she frequently likes to [[cut]] herself. Her power is death; meaning [[Chuck Norris|she can destroy anyone and anything]]. There was also an entire season devoted to her deciding that she was far too emo to be in the world and thus tried to destroy it.  Luckily for us, the government converted her to being a [[Mormon]] and she was able to stop thinking for herself.

* '''Kou Seiya (Sailor Star Fighter)''': One of the three shemales.  She is in constant pursuit of Usagi's [[vagina]], even though she herself is a [[16 year old girl]] who can magically turn into a [[13 year old boy]].  She/he/it was playing [[Handegg|American-style football]] in one episode where, following the game, she went into the locker room and got gang-banged by big sweaty azns who think they're white.  Her attack is called Star Serious Laser, a combination of the 2 meme's [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZAR]] and [[why so srs]].

* '''Kou Taiki (Sailor Star Maker)''': Taiki is the one who wears the pants in the group. He, err, she is always seen giving it to Yaten deep in the anus. Taiki also arguably has the gayest attack in the series. Her devastating "Star Gentle Uterus" attack sends out bubbles filled with aborted fetuses at her victims. China is currently studying the attack to help with population control.

* '''Kou Yaten (Sailor Star Healer)''': The bitch of the group.  Often seen getting ass-raped by Taiki, Yaten is as [[gay]] as they come. She gathers all the kinetic energy collected from the anal reaming and releases it in an attack called "Star Sensitive Inferno" that, while looks cool enough, does shit damage to enemies.  A totally useless character who gets overall about 30 minutes of screen time throughout the series.

* '''Princess Kakuyu''': Some sort of [[obvious|princess]] who appeared in the last season. Along with the Starlights, she was relatively useless, and was murdered by [[god|Galaxia]], [[guro|who slit her throat, ripped out her eyeballs, chopped off her nose, cut open her stomach, removed the intestines with her hands, decapitated her head, and cut through her legs.]] Galaxia later used Kakuyu's severed body parts in a soup that she fed to her [[Jesus|friend]].

* '''Sailor Megtune''': [[sonichu]]'s bitch

==[[Africa|The Dark Kingdom]]==

* '''Queen Beryl''': Queen of the [[Niggers|Negaverse]]. Queen Beryl was the major villain of the first season and a [[ginger]]. She is most definitely  an evil heartless bitch. Known for her army of dead souls and her extremely long huge hair as well as her long fingernails, Beryl tried to destroy Sailor Moon, She failed however, and went into seclusion.
* '''Jadeite''': He's at the [[gay|top of the list]] when it comes to Beryl's minions. A huge [[sexist]] pig, Jadeite was destroyed when Beryl placed him in the Arctic Sea, where he was later raped by a polar bear and killed.
* '''Nephrite''':He's the second on the list to appear. He wanted to get [[anal sex|up Mercury's ass]] but failed to do so and was killed by Queen Beryl. He resurfaced as a normal human, however. He also stalked Usagi's lesbian partner Naru until Zoisite v& him.
* '''Zoisite''': The [[fag|token gay]] of the group, Zoisite is involved in a sexual relationship with Kunzite. They have sex frequently, almost every episode. Unfortunately the asswipes who provided the English dub decided to turn Zoisite into a girl with no tits. Was killed trying to get into the club [[gay|Hercules]], but was recently seen alive, starring in a huge slaught of Gay Pornography.
* '''Kunzite''': He made Zoisite his [[yaoi|uke]]. They had [[buttsecks|hawtgaymansex]] every time they could. Kunzite was turned into a zombie by Beryl, but was converted into a normal human. He now works at T.V. Guide. His attempts to destroy the Sailor Scouts were so laughable any idiot could see through them.
* '''The DD Girls''': After watching an episode of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Beryl decided the best way to solve things was to fight 5 on 5. So she created the DD Girls, who all malfunctioned and exploded when Mercury [[all your base|hax'd into their l33tspaces.]]

==The Death Busters==

* '''Professor Tomoe''': A known [[pedophile]], Tomoe's daughter is Hotaru, AKA Super [[Emo]] Depressed Bitch of Darkness. He takes pleasure in being seduced by his servants, and is aroused by his own wicked laughter. 
* '''Kaorinite''': The [[ginger|Crimson haired]] bitch, Kaorinite is always there when your man needs his [[sexism|pies baked, his dinner made, and his house cleaned.]] Kaorinite was killed, then resurrected. She attacks using black magic and even her own hair. She tries to get the best out of the Professor to please him, but he [[mary sue|completely ignores her]]. She [[emo|slit her wrists]] and moved to Canada, where she assumed the alias "Sailor Kaori."
* '''Eudial''': The first of the Witches Five and also the other mistress of the flame that is not Sailor Mars, Eudial is a [[sexism|horrible driver]] and is an avid snail hater. She fired things up with her [[Gundam|transformer
big ass machine gun flame buster contraption, which she nicknamed "Fire Buster"]].
* '''Mimette''': Mimette took over as the second of the Witches Five. Mimette is a huge [[stalker]], and [[American Idol|has a crush on every male pop idol in exsistance.]] Once considered defecting to the Sailor team, but went into hiding after it was revealed she was a [[lesbian]]. She was recently seen trying to bomb the house of [[American Idol|Paula Abdul]].
* '''Telulu''': The third of the Witches Five, Telulu was the mistress of plant-life, and had wild plant orgies with her plants. She became aroused by the color green, and made her home in a greenhouse. Almost attempting to [[tentacle rape]] Usagi, she was beheaded by [[Batman|Poison Ivy]] after Ivy thought she was trying to copy off of her.
* '''Viluy''': Also known as Byruit. Viluy was a smart [[n00b|uber l33t space time geek]] who tried to use [[computers]] to take over the world, but was later defeated by Sailor Mercury during a [[Neon Genesis Evangelion|super huge robot anime meca battle.]]
* '''Cyprin''': She's the only member of the Witches 5 who has an evil counterpart. Her name is Petrol. They used their [[penis|super huge magic sticks]] [[rape|to try to defeat the Senshi]] but were [[butthurt|tricked into firing their own weapons at each other]] [[suicide|killing them.]]
* '''Mistress Nine''': [[spoiler|Mistress Nine is actually a super version of Hotaru.]] She is known for having massively large [[boobs]]. 

==Shadow Galactica==

*'''[[God|Sailor Galaxia]]''': Galaxia used to be a sailor scout, that is, until she got possessed by an evil power, which thus made the plotline even more damn confusing. She is a ruthless villain, possibly the biggest evil [[bitch]] in the entire series, and also the world record holder of killing the most heroes, as well as her subordinates. This list includes all Sailor Scouts, The Outer Senshi, Chibi Usa, Chibi Chibi, Kakuryu, The Starlights, and Tuxedo Mask.

*'''Sailor Iron Mouse''': The stupidest of the group, Iron Mouse fails at everything, including proper use of a [[condom]] as well as failing to find out the identity of Sailor Moon. This of course, led to her downfall, and just when it was thought Galaxia killed her, she simply removed her [[penis|male sex organs]]. She can currently be found preforming as Cinderella at [[Disney|Disney World.]]

*'''Sailor Aluminum Siren''': The only member who knew what Sailor Moon's identity was. Slightly brain dead, she shared a love for [[food|foods]], [[lesbian|as well as a romantic love for her sex partner Sailor Lead Crow.]] Killed by Galaxia, [[bullshit|but her soul split into two parts, one went into the soul of Rachel Ray, and the other went into the soul of Paula Deen.]]

*'''Sailor Lead Crow''': Possibly [[Hispanic]] or Pacific Islander, Lead Crow was in a lesbian relationship with Aluminum Siren. After Siren died, Crow went into a deep depression. Forced to work with Sailor Tin Nyanko, she formed a trap, but Nyanko sabotaged it. Crow fell into a [[black hole]] which transported her to Oz. She now works in Munchkinland as a tour guide/mail-woman.

*'''Sailor Tin Nyanko''': Did you know she was voiced by [[Pikachu]]? Nyanko was the most annoying of the group. This hyperactive cat bitch was a fan of [[bestiality]]. Worked with Lead Crow but caused her supposed death. Sailor Moon used her power to make half of Nyanko pure. However, Nyanko's [[vagina]] exploded shortly thereafter, and she died. Galaxia then used her corpse as a rug.

==Rating==
*''Action'': 10, Tokyo getting destroyed all over the damn place (but somehow in the end everyone totally forgets about it).
*''Lulz'': 10, until you realize that these guys are serious.
*''Furry Gayness'': 0, everyone is a demon in disguise so it's [[otherkin]] city.
*''Homosexuality'': 10, it's basically soft-core lesbian porn for children.
*''An Heroism'': 0, they sucked so bad at life none of them were ever able to successfully end it for themselves.

==English Adaptation==
If you though having Executive Producers and Network Censors cut out all the plot holes and character development from the anime were as bad as the series weeaboo followers, in 1993, Rocky Solotoff, president and founder of Toon Maker Inc. had hoped to capitalize on the success of Saban Entertainment's [[Power Rangers]] by creating an American live-action/western-animated version of Sailor Moon. Solotoff wrote, directed, and produced a pilot episode of his version of Sailor Moon for a company called Renaissance-Atlantic, who helped Saban [[steal|procure]] Super Sentai from Toei Animation to create the Power Rangers.

Since that day, Solotoff's version of Sailor Moon, which to this day, has not been exhibited publicly because it was shit.  Unfortunately, some poor soul had the strength to bootleg part of it and posted on the Internet years later.

A [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B4_VCeHfjo link] to this video is being posted because the Jews at [[Jewtube]] have figured out how not to share video with the Internet.
