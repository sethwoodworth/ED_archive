[[BoingBoing]] makes [[you|everyone]] want to [[Tubgirl|throw up]] when it claims to be "A directory of [[pain series|wonderful things]]" although one can doubt if anyone on ED (as an example!) would ever bother looking at their [[fucktard|mind-numbingly dull site]] unless absolutely necessary for collecting stuff to shove into a related article or to find specific details on [[drama]]. 

'''Spring 2005:''' Xeni Jardin of BoingBoing decided that trash [[attention whore]] and self-proclaimed "sex-blogger" [[Violet Blue]] was somehow a wonderful thing and made about 70 posts about the Violent Bore's pronouncements.
<br>

'''June 2007:''' Xeni suddenly decided that Violent was no longer a "wonderful thing", and [[delete fucking everything|ripped out every single post]] she'd made about Violent's [[sick fuck]]ery and [[boring|boring or out-of-date interests]].
<br> 

'''June 2008: '''One of Violent's [[john|customers]] discovered that the posts had all been removed, and told Violent.
<br>

The resulting storm in the disinfectant bowl where they used to keep their [[dildo|sex toys]] between sessions has to be one of the dullest blog dramas ever. The time-scale and subplots give a little [[Lulz|negative interest]] to all protagonists.

==[[Lesbian]] Lust in Blogland==
===Violent Bore [[Fuck|Penetrates]] the Directory of Wonderful Things===
[[Image:Xeni Jardin Violet Blue more happy memories 2.JPG|frame|right|Happy memories just never go cold!]]
Back in 2005, Xeni Jardin, peroxide queen, botox addict, and would-be [http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/24/bad-questions-to-ask.html#comment-149062 non-transsexual] sex goddess to [[13-year-old boys]], decided that "Violet Blue", writer of self-published dirty books that no-one buys and a [[blog]] that no-one reads, was a source of "[[crap|wonderful things]]".
"Violet's" wonderful things included a lot of ancient memes [[IRL]], like the wonders of jewellery made from small parts of dolls and a utility belt full of dildoes. Wonderful things? [[You]] fuckin' bet!

Check [http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pTUl8ENWP_9VKa8OWWHG8Xw this spreadsheet], which only lists about half to two-thirds of them. BoingBoing is a bit cheap to say "It is all in the [[Archive.org|Wayback Machine]]" because it is fucking hard to find stuff there; by the same token, it is impossible to have any sympathy with [[Violet Blue|Violent Bore]].

===Violet and Xeni had Feelings for Each Other===
Both being among the most viciously violent [[Attention Whore|attention whores]] in the fragile blogosphere of the [[USA]], Violet and Xeni soon developed feelings for each other.

This is how it '''really''' happened.
[[Image:Violet blue cheap cover.jpg|Violet Blue puts a lot of quality work into her self-published porn, check the design [[fail|skills]]!|thumb|left|250px]] 
{{Squote|Violet Blue's strap-on dildo can't help it if it has feelings for Xeni Jardin.| [[Cory Doctorow]]}}
{{Squote|And I can't help it if '''I''' have feelings for Xeni.| Cory}}
{{Squote|I can't help it if my strap-on dildo has feelings for Xeni.| Violet}}
{{Squote|I can't help it if I have feelings for Violet Blue's strap-on dildo.| Cory}}
{{Squote|[[Pwnd|I can't help it if I don't have feelings for Cory]], and I can't help it if I have feelings for Violet and her strap-on dildo.| Xeni}}
{{Squote|[[Pwnd|I can't help it if my strap-on dildo doesn't have feelings for Cory]], and I can't help it if my strap-on dildo has feelings for Xeni.| Violet}}

So Xeni and Violet indulged in a wild and public [[lesbian]] relationship, but Cory [[Pwnd|didn't get to join in]], not even as a [[Pegging|catcher]]. 

===[[Lesbian Breakup]] is [[War]]===
[[Image:Violet Xeni jail bed 1.jpg| Violet and Xeni on a date in a fetish brothel's jail cell.|thumb|300px|right]]
Violet boasted about her conquest on her blog, at parties and so on, and Xeni realized she'd been royally had by a [[jerk]], not that Xeni isn't one, but everything is relative, as Cory wants to tell you until your (and his) teeth fall out. A bit later, Xeni wisely [[delete fucking everything|deleted every fucking post from Violent Bore]]. [[Some argue]] that Violet's [[Violet_Blue#Hypocrisy.2C_thy_name_is_Violet|ugly act of trying to trademark her name]] and nastily strip an honest, hard-working and truly attractive [[porn star]] (see the gallery) from using it also peeved Xeni. Xeni is not saying, except that it 
{{Quote|wasn't a weird coverup| Xeni Jardin|New York Times}}
and was based on 
{{Quote|[[Lesbian bed death|private matters]] and [[Unwarranted self-importance|public behaviour]].| Xeni Jardin|New York Times}}

==Aftermath==
===The discovery===
[[Image:Xeni Jardin Violet Blue more happy memories.JPG|Looking a bit forced there, still happy?|frame|right]]
The deletions not being discovered for '''a whole year''' speaks volumes. Specifically, it says BoingBoing is irrelevant and everyone knows that Violet Blue is an attention whore and Xeni just wishes she would go away and be a typical nasty brothel madam like most of her ilk or do something else under her [[Power word|birth name]], which is sure as hell not "Violet Blue", despite [[lie|claims to the contrary]]&mdash;and that nobody gives a flying fuck about Violet Blue in reality. 

Both Xeni and Violet are favourite fantasy objects of [[13 year old boy|13-y-o boys]], Violet for her violent advocacy of [[anal]]ly raping them and Zeni as the older lady next door who looks a lot better than [[your mom]] and you really hope will notice you and want to wet your [[dong|wick]] for the first time (as long as you don't care about her cup size and fat legs, and like the way her calves are always enclosed in high-heeled [[Nazi|jackboots]]). 

===Reaction on BoingBoing===
BoingBoing (and specifically Xeni) decided that Violent was no longer a wonderful thing.

{{Quote|This is a directory of wonderful things. If we no longer think something is wonderful, we have every right to remove it from this directory.| Xeni Jardin|somewhere early in [http://www.boingboing.net/2008/07/01/that-violet-blue-thi.html this fucking mess.]}}

And

{{Quote|[T]his is our home, we are proud of the home we built and the guests who visit here with us, and we like spending time here ourselves -- so we don't like to leave piles of shit lying around on the floor.(Violet BJew's Chocolate Strap-on)| Xeni Jardin|[http://www.metafilter.com/72928/Boing-Boing-Finds-21st-Century-Trotsky#2167601 "revised" by mods to remove profanity]}}
[[Image:Violet Blue picks her teeth 2005.jpg|Why Violet Blue lasted two minutes as BoingBoing's "wonderful thing"!|thumb|200px]]

In a later statement, Xeni decided that BoingBoing was not [[LOL|"A Directory of "Wonderful Things"]] but a collection of private blogs.

The stupidest thing BoingBoing did was to announce that they were not deleting Violent Bore's [[crap]]; neither had they removed it; the BoingBoing bores [[Asking for it| really asked for it]] when they tried to pass it off as "unpublishing". Let that word live only in infamy with Violent Bore (and BoingBoing).

The horrifically [[tl;dr|boring]] comments about the incident passed 1,700 just before the 10th of July. This is a false figure, because they have deleted a [[crapflood|shitload]] of stuff from [[Troll|trolls]] (some of '''that''' was probably entertaining, unlike the protagonists) and people whose comments they just didn't like. It really passed 2,000 a few days earlier, so who wants to read the leftovers? We want to see the deleted stuff, but that is probably also a total bore.

A lot of these [[fucktard]]s are moaning, bitching, and whining about how this makes BoingBoing Big Brother from Orwell's ''1984'' or claiming that the whole thing is like the courtroom scene from some crap [[Hollywood]] movie (''A Few Good Men''?) or even the courtroom scene from a happy accident like ''THX1138''. Why they have nothing better to do with their time is hard to see.

BoingBoing brooked no comment until a year or two ago, so the [[crapflood]] they have received on this non-event is slightly interesting and [[lulz]]y because they claim to be for [[free speech]], but only enabled comments to get more desperately needed page-hits for their dull part of the Internets: they sure as [[shit]] got a [[shit]]pile for this non-event. 

On Violet <strike>J</strike>Blew:
{{quote|She writes columns about, for example, where the best places in the Bay Area are to find people who will take a dump on you for money.| "johnnypotatoes" on Violet Blue|Valleywag.com}}

Kaplannnn!

===Violent Bore's Reaction===
Look it up for yourself if you want to be a total [[fucktard|fucking idiot]]. The link is below. ED has [[Violet Blue|an article]] if you really want to know more. Not that BoingBoing has any value as a source.

===<strike>J</strike>NYT===
[[Image:Violet blue is a sick fuck.jpg|thumb|Violet Blue is a [[sick fuck]].]]

Violet Blue did have a few great overstatements when she talked with the very sympathetic <strike>J</strike>New York Times (guess she must have told them her birth name, or maybe they could just tell).
{{Quote|[[BAWWW|The idea of someone unpublishing you is horrifying]].| "[[Victim|Violet Blue]]"|New York Times}}
... and "Violet" unleashes a typical gush of [[unwarranted self importance]].
{{Quote|Really, it is between BoingBoing and the world.| "Violet Blue"|New York Times}}
Oh, so "Violet" somehow represents the world? Meet [[Michael Jackson]]!!!

===Subsidiary Attention Whores===
[[Image:Passion of violet and xeni.JPG|More of Violet and Xeni in the [[Vagina|pink]] of passion.|thumb|left|200px]]
A moderator on BoingBoing and some [[expert]] blogger who posts on Valleywag and fucked someone on BoingBoing (or someone connected with someone on BoingBoing through [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:VioletBlueFucklist.png this trail] of Bay  Area [[incest]] and [[disease]]) have tried to big-note themselves as the be-all and end-all of contemplation about this storm in the dildo-cleansing cup. Follow the links for this article if you '''really''' want to read their earnestly self-seeking carping.

One of them said 

{{Quote|Thank you all for caring [[Shit nobody cares about|what happens on Boing Boing]].| Some [[BoingBoing#Teresa_Nielsen_Hayden|BoingBoing moderator]] for whom noone could possibly care.}}

and

{{Quote|If you think it does oblige them, and that the fact that they haven't told you everything somehow transforms them into scheming weasels, then I'm sorry, but you're a blockhead.| [[BoingBoing#Teresa_Nielsen_Hayden|Same dumb moderator]]|Doing an excellent job at [[Me_versus_the_World|damage control]].}}
