My Strange Addiction
'''My Strange Addiction''', which would be a pretty cool name for a band, is a new and exciting [[old media]] show broadcast on [[TLC]], America's favorite channel for gawking at [[geeks]], freaks, gimps, and [[crazy]] people of all kinds.  It had some pretty good programming about [[midgets]], [[Mormons]] with huge families, and weird pregnancies.  "John and Kate Plus Eight" was one of their most successful programs mostly because Kate was a total [[bitch]] to her vaguely [[Asian]] husband.  John left his wife and annoying family to [[party hard]] and wear Ed Hardy t-shirts, and TLC needed a new horrorshow to attract viewers, so they came up with "My Strange Addiction," which is pure [[win]] for those who enjoy the misfortune of others.

This freakshow showcases people who don't actually have addictions, but rather extremely severe cases of [[OCD]].  These fine folks are just average people who happen to derive pleasure from eating strange things, engaging in self-destructive behavior, and worst of all, being a [[furry]].  These people actually know that what they are doing is fucked up and weird, but they either don't care or are living in total denial.  Arguably, the funniest part of the show is when they are confronted by psychologists and doctors who tell them in no uncertain terms that they are fucked up mental cases who need to just fucking quit what they are doing.

==The Freaks==

The following people have given up their privacy and offered themselves up as [[lolcow]]s sacrificed [[for the lulz]]:

'''People who eat weird shit:'''

[[Image:Trichobezoar.jpg|thumb|right|Eat a bunch of random shit, and this could happen to you.]]
People who eat non-food substances have a disorder called ''pica'', a rare version of OCD.  It often afflicts pregnant [[black chicks]] who eat clay and dirt.  It was once thought that they did this because their diet was lacking in minerals, but this has been dismissed as [[bullshit]].  They're just crazy.  TLC tells the stories of the following [[fucktard]]s afflicted with ''pica'':

*A [[negress]] who eats soap and laundry detergent.  She insists that it makes her feel good and "clean inside."  Soapy water was once used to make people vomit, so it's a mystery how she keeps all this crap down.
*Another [[negress]] who likes to eat the foam rubber from couch cushions.  It would be interesting to find out how many couches this young lady has deprived her family of.  She went to see a psychologist "just to get [her] family off her back."  She found out that she could develop a bezoar, a lump of undigested crap that sits in the stomach or intestine, waiting to cause bowel obstruction and death.  She had an endoscopy to see what was in her stomach, and unfortunately, it was empty.  No bezoar, no [[lulz]].
*Yet another [[negress]] who eats toilet paper.  She has to carry toilet paper everywhere she goes, or she has a major freakout.
*Some old [[white trash]] [[skank]] who eats powdered bathroom cleaner.  Comet seems to be her preferred brand, because everybody knows that Ajax is cheap and doesn't have that "mouth watering" (her words) smell.  Bartenders Friend?  Out of the question.  Only Comet satisfies this old [[skeezer]]'s cravings.  She kept eating the stuff even though it caused teeth to become infected and extrude pus.  TLC sent her to a cosmetic dentist who told her [[lol|all her upper teeth had to be pulled]], and it would cost $19,000 to replace her grill.  She began to cry, providing viewers major [[lulz]], but the dentist had to be a [[bitch]] about it and offer to do the dental work for free.  Nice way to deflate a [[lulz]] boner, TLC.

'''People who lift heavy shit:'''

*Lauren is a bodybuilder who would work out constantly if she could.  Every spare minute of her life is spent bodybuilding.  What she needs to do is to put down the weights and pick up a frying pan, an iron, or a [[cock]].
*Another guy likes to lift heavy shit.  He doesn't really care what it is, as long as it's heavy.  He'll lift refrigerators, huge chains used to moor Navy ships to the dock, dumbbells, whatever.  

'''Other crazy people:'''

*One girl named Lori likes to sleep with her blow dryer running, despite the fact that she has awakened in the morning with burns.
*A 20 year old [[skank]] loves tanning so much she looks like an oompa loompa.  Her skin is way too dark, and her hair is bleached almost white.  She has no idea how hideous she looks, since she is like a woman who is so afraid of change that she is still wearing the beehive hairdo she began wearing in the 1960's.  She admits that she tans at three separate facilities a day because she's only limited to twenty minutes a day at any one place.  She's been burned so badly her ass developed additional cracks that bled and wept serum.  After being confronted by two doctors and a skin cancer survivior, she refuses to give up tanning.
*Rachel is a twentysomething [[hambeast]] that spends two hours a day picking her own scabs.  When there aren't enough scabs, she cuts herself, creating fun new wounds to pick at.  She's engaged to some guy named Bobby, who looks normal, but must be fucked up in some deep way to agree to marry a morbidly obese woman who cuts herself and gets off on picking the scabs.  It seems very likely that he did a stretch in prison.
*"Davecat" is a self-loathing Negro from Detroit who talks white and loves his RealDoll.  He ''really'' loves is RealDoll, so much so that instead of just fucking it and slinging it off the bed and crying himself to sleep in lonely shame, he treats it like his wife.  It makes one wonder what he would do if it breathed and talked, threw dishes and called him names, like a ''real'' woman.

===Lauren the [[furfag]]===
[[Image:LaurentheFurfag.jpg|thumb|right|O HAI THAR!]]
[[File:Lauren Atkins.JPG|thumb|Why she wears the [[fursuit]].]]
From the Furry News Network:  ''Lauren Atkins, aka [[furry|Kiira the fennec fox]] can’t imagine going to a party or social event without wearing her fur suit. She’s completely dedicated to her “fursona” — [http://kiiracommissions.webs.com/ designing and sewing her costume well into the night], it even takes priority to finding a job.''  

Lauren is a sad case of a woman with so many body image issues and mental health problems that she can not face life as a [[human]]. Instead of taking a nice, strong dose of [[shotgun mouthwash]] or swallowing an entire bottle of Elavil (hint, HINT!) like a [[you|reasonable person]], she instead has decided to wrap her entire life around imaginary creatures: [[furries]].  

Apparently, her obsession with furversion began after her father died when she was 13.  Instead of developing a drug habit or becoming a [[whore]] like a [[NORP]], she entered the sick, sad world of furry.  It's a real shame, as Lauren was actually rather fuckable when she was younger, but putting on and pulling off a greasy furry head has wreaked havoc on her complexion.  She's also gotten to be quite the [[hambeast]], because obviously, her human skin isn't her real self, so she can eat donuts all night long as she lives her lonely internet life.

She wears her [[fursuit]] constantly and will not go into public without it. She refuses to answer to her own name, insisting that she be referred to "Kiira the fennec fox". Her only friends and relationships are [[dying alone|with other furries online]]. She doesn't even go to [[work]] or [[college]] anymore as she is too busy [[furry|being a furry]]. Of course, other furries condone these behaviors, believing that [[insane|being a "furry 24-7" is a good thing]]. 

With no friends, her masculine, bald, badass cousin made fun of to try to snap her out of it.  "Hey, why don't you push the ball down the lane with your tail!" he jeered as she went bowling in her fursuit. Yet that wasn't enough to get her attention. 

Seeing her cousin failed to get Lauren's attention, her mom was rightfully concerned and had to tell the girl to remove the fox head so they could talk. Her mom told her that [[truth|she has a real problem]]. Lauren got [[BAWW|very defensive]] and insisted [[furry|it was just a hobby]], the typical furfag response to [[fursecution]].

Lauren was sure she was going to stay a furry forever as she really was [[otherkin|a for real and true fox]] and [[fursecution|nobody could ever take her furriness away from her]]. It's [[lies|something you're born]] into like being [[Gay]] or [[retarded]], you know! [[USI|Everyone would see her story]] and agree with her that she was right and [[facepalm|applaud her bravery]].

Of course, as everyone watching the show was sane, the response was the exact opposite. The only people agreeing were the echo chambers of the [[furry]] fandom. Everyone else now knew that the girl in the fox suit was irreparably insane and warned their children to stay away from her. Millions of people found her site and sent her emails and soon she was [[BAWW]]ing to the Furry news about her own comments.

''I’d love to get my side of the story out.''
:You did that already, cunt. TV show, remember?

''[[delete fucking everything|I have left the fandom]], though I still do make [[fursuit|costumes]] and occasionally go out in it with my [[furry|friends who are also furs]]. I [[lies|just don’t associate myself as a furry anymore]].''
: So you are leaving forever, yet still [[yiff|hang with furries]] and [http://kiiracommissions.webs.com/ take fursuit commissions]... Sure, "not a furry".

''But they [[no|totally twisted everything]], I can [[facepalm|just tell by the preview]].''
: You're judging things based on assumptions... just like a furry...

''[[lies|I told them I only go out maybe once a month if that. I never bring it out around people that aren’t furs, and I never once brought it to a gathering or social event]]. Yet they say [[truth|I can’t stand to be without it for one minute]].''
: Sure, that's why you went bowling, shopped for clothes, went to a public cafe, and even read books in it with your non-furry camera crew. You even said you were always going to be this way.

''[[truth|I know my video will just provoke the community more]], but I do [[USI|need to get my side of the story out regardless]]. I’m glad there are still some people with common sense in this world.''
: Yes, like those who all know you're insane. [[gg]], [[retard]].
