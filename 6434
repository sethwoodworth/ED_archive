'''PissedOffVideoGamer''' / '''PissedOffAngryGamer''' ''(IRL name: "Eric")'' is an [[fat|morbidly obese]] [[lolcow]] and [[In Soviet Russia|Russian immigrant]] that looks like an [[IRL]] [[Dragomike]]. He is like the [[Angry Video Game Nerd]] if he were to go on an endless eating rampage at a local Ponderosa. As a person from the [[Iraq|old country]], the PissedOffVideoGamer managed to hone his gaming skill by playing a lot of third rate knockoffs such as ''Super Bolshevik Bros.'' and ''[[Epic Fail Guy]]''. Unfortunately, the old country did not have treadmills, as he weighs no less than [[Lie|one metric ton at the ripe old age of 24]].

==Reviews==

[[Image:Fat_Guy.jpg|thumb|MAN THE HARPOONS!!!]]

PissedOffVideoGamer is best known for his video game reviews on [[YouTube]]. In them, he proceeds to review a video game or system by yelling for no apparent reason whatsoever. He also feels the need to poke at things with a stick in lieu of his laziness. He also exercises his [[fail|l33t]] [[Windows Movie Maker]] editing skills by superimposing red eyes over his own to prove that he is [[unfunny|the angriest gamer you've ever heard]]. He clearly does not understand the concept of audio balance, so every time he yells (which is [[99.9%]] of the time), your ears get raped by ugly static. To top it all off. he splices in footage from the Angry Video Game Nerd, the [[Angry German Kid]], and that guy who gets pissed off at ''[[Halo]]'' to prove that his anger is [[serious business]].

In short, the common rule for his game reviews is if he cannot eat it, then it is a piece of shit and must be destroyed for tempting him and his gluttony. Hence his common references to food in his reviews include comparing the [[Nintendo|Nintendo Gamecube]] game to a chocolate chip cookie and the [[Playstation 3]] to a bucket of Popeye's Fried Chicken.

Newcomers will believe that he is only a skilled [[troll]], but upon further investigation, the PissedOffVideoGamer thinks of his reviews as serious business, which only makes him that much greater a lolcow. He is so fucking fat that he needs to breathe for like 10 seconds between each word making his videos ten times longer than if he actually were to speak like a normal person. In some of his movies he shows his video game collection which consists of countless [[Professional Wrestling|rasslin']] games and in general shitty games, it appears for some strange reason that he has to read on the back of the box on each game to determine if it's a good game or not because he probably hasn't ever played them, only bought some shitty games [[Xbox_kid|to show everyone online that he has them]].

==Notable Videos==

In the following video, the [[You|fat fuck]] believes that repeatedly saying the word 'shit' is the funniest thing since [[rape]], and that by using his outstanding thought inducing simile of likening the Gamecube disks to cookies, he is going to earn himself a lot of [[NO U|fans.]] Unfortunately, all he achieves is a mildly entertaining video, and horrified faces from [[noone|anyone]] who knows the devestating health effects of chronic [[Fat|obesity.]] The video also happens to include special effects worse and less believable than [[Gay|Justin Bieber's]] claim of [[ Straight|hetrosexuality]], plus the elephant saying '[[Afghanistan|fucking piece of shit]]' in slow motion. [[Fact|True dat]].

==Reaction to the Haters==

Many of the people who watch his videos comment on how fat he is and how he should try and exercise for great justice. Due to these sayers of truth, the PissedOffVideoGamer has constantly deleted and reuploaded his own videos to say these words...

{{quote|[[Lie|You Can Diss Me And Threaten Me And Make Fun Of Me Call Me A Retard Or Any Other Bullshit That You All Want Say My Videos Suck Me Personally I Just Dont Give A Fuck Because Im Gonna Continue Making and Uploading Videos Woooooooooooooo]]|PissedOffVideoGamer}}

Where the fuck did the "Woooooooooooooo" come from? Who knows. Most likely it was gas escaping. Then again, he plays shitty WWE roles so he must probably blowing his hero [[Chris Benoit|Ric Flair]].

His grammar is a source of [[fail]], as it is made of capital letters and misspellings (And clearly contains no form of punctuation, thus angering the [[Grammar Nazi]]s) although this is understandable, as he was a valedictorian in the old country.

God help us when he decides to collaborate with the [[Numa Numa|Numa Numa Guy]]. The world will collapse due to the epic amount of fat in one sitting.

==baaawwwwwwwww==
Fatty McEatsalot then decided that he could stand the flames no longer, and became an [[YouTube]] [[an hero|hero]] by closing his account. <S>This act robbed us all of laughing at his videos, and only his review of the Nintendo Shitcube remains.</s> [[DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]

Watch one mans struggle as he attempts to walk to the refrigerator. Equipped only with his pointin' stick and sloth like reflexes watch him make anï»¿ "incredible journey" as called by Roger Ebert, to his kitchen. You will feel the emotion with quotes like "one cannot simply walk in to kitchen" and dis....looks like a.... fucking.... chocolate chip kookeh. NY times calls it simply breathtaking. Coming to a drive-in near you! ]]|jakixs}}
