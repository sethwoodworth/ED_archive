Jeff
Jeff used to be a simple individual admin on the [http://www.disboards.com/forumdisplay.php?f=97 Disboards] until raided by Ebaums World and provoked. He then turned into a wild Snorlax, and proceeded to give up his anal virginity to a mudkips.

The Dis forum relies on Jeff to "think of the children."

"I like Miley, she's cool and battles the one-eyed snake even though it spits at her. And she doesn't afraid of anything."


== [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/d/d0/Failvasion.png The Great Failvasion] ==
On May 12, 2008 the forums at [http://www.disboards.com http://www.disboards.com] were invaded. Various 4chan users, mostly [[newfags|newfags]], posted a picture of Miley Cyrus with "questionable liquid" all over her face. Said picture is included. At that point, various newfags began to directly spout off 4chan references. One faghole went so far as to link directly to the invasion thread on 4chan. Rules 1&2 were carelessly broken, and Jeff was called to the scene. "Jeff, delete this thread."

Epic lulz was the primary objective of the invasion. Unfortunately, the overwhelming presence of newfags caused the invasion to fail, though it spread over numerous threads and Hannah Montana related websites. Though the invasion itself was made of fail, Jeff became a meme.
