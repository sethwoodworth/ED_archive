== '''Introduction''' ==

{{quote|He's probably freaking out right now|Wheatarted while discussing this very article.}}


[http://www.theforum.com/member.php?u=29503/ Waxlabltabler]
is a twenty-something internet user known for his obsessive and irrational behaviors while surfing the Internet.  Although he himself considers these behaviors to be [[Lame|"cute"]] and [[Unfunny|"funny,"]] most of the people he deals with on the web and on IRC consider him to be a [[Internet stalking|creep of the highest order.]]
[[Image:footsteps.jpg|thumb|center|175px|A lonely Wax...will he ever find somebody to walk those beaches with him?]]

== '''Description''' ==

[[Image:Realwax.jpg|thumb|center|175px|waaaaaaaaaaaaax]]

Waxlabltabler is a black person that is often confused with a [[yeti|mythical creature,]] approximately [[giant|seven feet tall]] and posessing an evil leer the size of a Greyhound bus grill.  He walks with shoulder’s slumped and is known to drive an automobile several sizes to small for a being of such size.  It has been speculated that his use of such a small vehicle can be attributed to an attempt at making his [[luser|penis look larger. ]]

He is commonly known as “Wax” by other [[you|denizens of the Internet]] because of his waxen appearance and also because nobody has ever bothered to attempt saying his full name aloud.

Because of his well known, yet unfounded and [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder|ridiculous fear of microbes,]] it is rather odd that this creature does not take more pride in his [[monster|shambling, sloth-like appearance.]]  Opting for long, dirty t-shirts and baggy [[sloth|“Fubu” jeans]] as his natural garb, it makes very [[insane|little sense]] that this creature should feel any sort of compulsion in connection with bacterial life.  Furthermore, his compulsive neurosis should point to a constant cleaning of his local environment, yet this does not happen.  One wonders how a creature can be both insanely aware of bacteriological hazards nearby and yet look like a [[acne|towering unshaven beast.]]

Wax appears to enjoy [[alcohol|cheap hard alcohol]] if it is presented to him as a [[drugs|gift.]]  Such gifts are the only way this [[animal|creature]] can socialize outside of the Internet due to its lack of a job, lack of money, and [[africa|general lack of drive.]]  He prefers to beg, borrow, or pester somebody into helping him out in such endeavors. 

[[Image:Babywax.jpg|thumb|center|175px|How could something this cute grow so monstrous by the age of 18?]]

== '''Irrational Actions and Fears''' ==


Some of this creature’s more interesting [[aids|traits]] are its phobias.  Wax tends to shy away from [[dog|dogs,]] germs, and [[vagina|vaginas.]]  It is interesting to note that while Wax shies away from [[vagina|vaginas,]] he tends to talk incessantly about them. These phobias shall be discussed more thoroughly:

*'''Dogs'''
First, it must be noted that Wax often misjudges the [[friend|friendly wag of a dogs tail]] as an attempted attack on his own person.  While dogs, at times, can be scary, this irrational fear has nothing to do with sharp teeth or claws, but more to do with a dog’s overall lack of cleanliness.  Since dogs lick their own asses, eat the feces of other dogs along with their own, and are capable of licking their own junk, dogs tend to give [[Attention whore|Wax]] an overall unease when dealing with them.  This unease has gone to the point of Wax leaving the domicile of a person who owns a dog…when the dog sits down next to him on the couch.


*'''Germs'''

While it has been discussed that Wax has an irrational fear of [[whores|vaginas]] and their supposed content of [[Bestiality|germs,]] it must also be noted that this fear extends out, away from the [[List of Terms Referring to a Woman's Period|human female’s body.]]  Since most of everything you can see, touch, smell, and hear is literally covered in germs, there is no known way to completely sterilize a normal home environment.  This does not stop the subject from [[Fap|washing his hands several times a day,]] inquire about the location of any nearby antibacterial hand soap, [[poop|wipe]] the couch he sleeps on with a baby wipe, or obsessively pick at any loose scraps of furniture in his den.  Further, Wax expresses an obsessive revulsion to common grass.  Witnesses have seen him stop, mumble to himself something unintelligible, and then walk around a two-foot patch of grass.


*'''Vaginas''' (also [[HTS-Noob|butt holes)]]
Vaginas are the breeding ground of germs.  This is a very simple concept to Wax, and he will go out of his way to “hide in plain sight” when confronted with vagina.  Since Wax is convinced that vaginas contain germs, Wax will have nothing to do with them what so ever.  It has been noted in several close experiences with Wax that he will go so far as to request “a night out” with “girls” in an effort to seem like one of the guys, when, in fact, everybody knows he is a cop out.

[[Image:Waxpussy.jpg|thumb|center|175px|Wax's idea of a vaginer]]

'''Example:'''

<pre>12:34pm (Wax) hey, lets go to the a titty bar

12:34pm (dan) sorry, no can do.

12:35pm (Wax)TITTAYS TITTAYS TITTAYS TITTAYS!!!!

12:35pm (dan) wax, vaginas have germs

12:36pm (Merk) yeah

12:36pm (Wax) …

12:36pm (Wax) fuck you guys.</pre>

Note that the subject does not leave the channel, but rather sits by idle.  Hoping that his [[butthurt]] will somehow garner him some respect or perhaps germless [[boob|titties.]]


== '''Wax and Begging''' ==


Wax is renowned in his [[insane|ability]] to get on a person’s every last nerve.  This uncanny ability usually manifests itself in the form of begging, but can also take the form of his incessant blather concerning any sort of [[16_year_old_girls|minutia]] that strikes his fancy at the moment.  This section will only deal with Wax’s begging, and this attribute goes outside any sort of ordinary sort of begging.  The definition of this behavior defies any commonsensical asking of favors, services or goods.  It is a constant [[Columbine|droning]] that sounds somewhat similar to a large and broken chainsaw attempting to rattle its way through a bone located just close enough to one’s jawbone and ear that it also causes fillings and eardrums to noisily fall to the floor.

Wax has tried to refine his begging technique, make it more subtle.  This is still annoying and because of it's crude clumsiness, it can be seen from a mile away.  Witness how Wax, in denial, [[Wishlist|still attempts to find pictures of internet titty.]]

=== Example 1 ===

<pre>
9:18:41 Gnarovsky : wax are you an overweight black dude?
9:18:58 Gnarovsky : or is that a joke?
9:20:57 wax : yes i am
9:21:00 wax : that is real
9:22:04 Wheatarted : He's just a sad fat virgin who lusts after girls online that he could never obtain in real
 life because he's a peasant
9:22:14 Gnarovsky : aww
9:22:15 Gnarovsky : c'mon
9:22:18 Gnarovsky : he didn't need that
9:22:46 Gnarovsky : his Psyche is all outta wack now
9:22:49 Wheatarted : He needs a good lynching
9:22:57 wax : i'm just sad that she's so bitter
9:23:00 wax : it's hilarious
9:24:16 wax : she's been on this kick for awhile
9:24:21 wax : like more than 6 months
9:24:23 wax : it's horrendous
9:24:31 wax : all because i want to see her large breasts
9:24:39 wax : apparently it hurts her feelings
9:24:51 Wheatarted : It doesn't hurt my feelings that you want to see them
9:24:56 Wheatarted : But it hurts yours that I won't show them to you
9:24:57 wax : what then?
9:25:04 wax : ah yes
9:25:10 wax : you say no for absolutely no reason
9:25:12 wax : i'd forgotten
9:25:26 wax : think you'll lose your power?
9:25:32 Wheatarted : I say no becuase I have no want to show them to anyone who isn't my other half
9:25:41 wax : oh yeah
9:25:41 wax : that
9:25:43 ddog_ : THATS ILLOGICAL WHEAT
9:25:46 wax : lol
9:25:56 wax : what would porn stars think
9:26:07 Schmeckatr0n : r u a porn star?
9:26:09 Wheatarted : Well I am not a porn star, so what they think isn't relevant to me
9:26:23 wax : i've got a couple friend
9:26:23 wax : s
9:26:25 wax : lol
9:26:38 Wheatarted : By that he means his left, and right hand
9:26:41 Wheatarted : and sometimes his foot
9:26:52 ddog_ : that's flexibility
9:27:00 Schmeckatr0n tries to reach his crotch with his foot
</pre>

=== Example 2 ===

Here is another classic example of Wax begging for tits from a girl who obviously does not want to share them with a Sasquatch.

<pre>
[13:14] Session Ident: wax (bray36@hidden-B9CE2D4B.insight.res.rr.com)
[13:14] <wax> you're not still afraid that i'll make fun of you or spread your pictures around, are you?
[13:14] > No I'm afraid cuz you're a big black guy
[13:14] <wax> that's nonsense
[13:14] <wax> beyond that, what do you mean
[13:15] > I am not "afraid" to post my breasts, and I do not hvae low self esteem because 
I won't show you my breasts..I simply will never show anyone other then jon my breasts because 
really he's the only one who needs to see them..
[13:16] <wax> im just saying that attracting people who are known for obnoxious criticism might 
be convincing you to avoid the whole matter
[13:16] <wax> i'm left to speculate
[13:16] <wax> so i did so
[13:16] <wax> can i see them?
[13:16] > YOu're not very bright are you?
[13:17] <wax> i still dont understand why you care so much about defending that statement
[13:17] <wax> bright doesnt have much to do with it
[13:17] > I am not defending anything
[13:17] <wax> yes you are
[13:17] <wax> with all your actions in the category, frankly
[13:19] > I am simply telling you that I have no intention or inclination to show people my breasts..
A) because I have morals and values.. and B) because I have self respect
[13:19] <wax> both of which are reasons why you shouldnt mind
[13:19] <wax> honestly
[13:19] > You are retarded
[13:19] > seriously
[13:19] > you need to get laid
[13:19] <wax> i could say the same for you
[13:19] > or a lobotomy
[13:20] <wax> you act like something's going to change, like your Relationship-o-meter 
with Jon will be forever altered
[13:20] > Even if I was single
[13:20] > I would not post them
[13:20] <wax> whatever "-o-meter" then
[13:20] <wax> your ideals seem false
[13:20] > I have been using the interent for 12yrs.. and never once in those 12 yrs have 
I ever thought to myself "gee..let's show strangers my tits"
[13:21] <wax> im not a stranger
[13:21] > yeah you are
[13:21] > I don't know you..
[13:21] <wax> a guy on a street in a town you've never been to is a stranger
[13:21] <wax> i on the other hand, am nothing but truthful to you
[13:22] > You are a stranger to me
[13:22] > you're no different then some person I pass by on the street
</pre>

== '''Wax and His Internet Relationships''' ==

[[Image:Waxirc.jpg|thumb|center|175px|I like how Marvz is mowing the lawn.  Photo by Nickdanger]]

for new years eve, wax got into the airplane glue and tried to post in #spf.  here is what he had to say:

<pre> 
<wax> i like all women
<wax> every women
<wax> even some men
</pre>

more rantings.  this actually happened:

<pre>
<wax> still banned
<wax> still banned
<wax> still banned
<wax> still banned
<wax> still banned
<wax> still banned
<wax> still banned
<wax> still banned
</pre>


If you should ever meet up with Wax during your Internet surfing or [[Irc|IRC chatting,]] you should take extra precautions…especially if you are a girl.  

'''Example:'''

<pre>(8:19pm) Wheatarted : Wax thinks that we have a relationship because we talk online... 
and he feels I should show him my boobs because we're in a relationship.
(8:20pm) Wheatarted : He comes up with all kinds of reasons why I owe him photos of my boobs.
(8:20pm) azariel : and he believes them all.
(8:21pm) Wheatarted : my favorite one is that I won't show him my tits because I have low self-esteem.</pre>

It should be noted that this is not an extreme; Wax is this way with every female he meets on the Internet.

When dealing with Wax, sometimes you have to just throw up your hands and let him speak to nobody in particular for a while.  It has been noted that some success can be had (if you are forced to chat while he is around, acting insane) while putting up with Wax's malarkey by simply using one word "short" or sarcastic replies.

'''Example:'''

<pre>
Wax: whats up?
azariel: nothing.

9:06:36     wax : did you have the internet when you were 19?
9:06:44     wax : thought not
9:06:49     wax : keep judging me
9:07:15     dan : you asked for advice, we gave it to you. you came back the next day and asked for the same advice,
 we gave it to you. you came back the next 1000 nights and asked advice, we got tired of it and moved on
9:07:36     wax : there was a reason
9:07:39     dan : OH MY LAWS I BE INSECURE... dont give me that crap
9:07:40     wax : whether you liked it or not
9:07:53     wax : <@dan> OH MY LAWS I BE INSECURE <-- what does this mean?
9:08:04     wax : it seems to be missing a word or two, honestly
9:08:23     dan : it means we got tired of hearing about how you wanted/needed something over and over and over
9:08:24     wax : in my experience, people's advice changes as their knowledge changes
9:08:35     dan : not in your case
9:08:52     wax : since yours was basically "don't worry about it, stop asking us." i found it to be insufficient
9:09:15     wax : since everyone i met was "worried about it" and since most of you are 10+ years their age
9:09:17     dan : you only remeber the final 200 times we got tired of hearing about it
9:09:18     wax : with children
9:09:21     wax : and careers
9:09:34     dan : what have you done in the time since?
9:09:35     wax : much unlike the people i interact with daily
9:09:37     dan : nothing
9:09:39     wax : but let's ignore that and cry
9:09:49     wax : about what, exactly?
9:10:07     dan : anything, i dont have to follow your rules. you havent changed one bit
9:10:07     wax : you're trying to discuss this without discussing it
9:10:11     wax : yet again
9:10:22     dan : or, i dont feel the need to do this again
