'''OpenGraphics''' is a project whereby a large group of [[Linux]]-using [[sex|sexual deviants]] are attempting to design a video card with which they can visualize explicit sex scenes with children and other victims while being [[free]] as in [[freedom]].

== Current Project Status ==
The OpenGraphics project has presently stalled. This is suspected to be due to the project team spending more time [[wapanese|eating Pocky]] than actually doing any development work. Most of the project team believes that magical [[fairies]] called FPGAs will make the project work.

== Reactions ==
The OpenGraphics project has caused much anguish in the [[corporate]] world. This is because there are millions of sane developers whose personal livelihoods depend on these deviants not being [[free]]. To counteract the problem, they have anonymously mailed lots of furry porn to the development mailing lists, hoping to cause the project to fall apart. This effort appears to have succeeded.
