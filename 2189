Demonoid
[[Image:Demonoid_guy.jpg|right|150px|]]'''Demonoid.com''' is a site which primarily hosts torrents for it's members. The clued in punter however, realises that it is nothing more than a front for so called "pirates" to [[circlejerk]] cyber style and to talk general smut to each other in the privacy of the Demonoid forums, since no one would actually want to download anything from them, because there is no [[porn|pronz]] on Demonoid (rly). On the bright side though you don't have as many retards from the movie industry trying to sue you.

==ED Wants Code==


Demonoid members strut around the internet like they're [[Celebrity|Tom and Katie]]. Many internet forums have had their decent, honest threads vandalised with requests for Demonoid codes and Demonoid members are well known for their barbarism in giving out invite codes. Requesters are often made to eat ass to demonstrate the talents in which they can bring to the Demonoid "community".

==Demonoid Has History?==

Demonoid was originally created by some Serb terrorist called Deimos who wished to share [[cake]] recipes with other internet users. The pirates of the internet quickly invaded his land of cake, and filled his life with [[smut]] and [[cp]]. In 2007, the [[Canadia|Canadian]] [[MPAA|Recording Industry Association]] posted legal threats against Demonoid and the site was taken offline [[lie|temporarily]]. Why Deimos actually feared the [[Chuggo|lovely Canadians]] is something we'll never know. Seriously, have you ever seen a Canadian looking scary? 

Somehow, the demotards realised that Canadia is nothing to be feared, let alone it's music "industry", and is now once again back online [[fail|but minus Deimos.]]  Apparently if there's one thing Deimos fears more than Canadians, it's [[Russia|Ukrainians]] (where Demonoid's servers are said to now operate). Canadians are no longer allowed to touch Demonoid though, and doing so will initiate the self destruct sequence in all Canadian [[computer|computers]]. Poor Canaduhs, although experts agree that this could be a [[win]] for global population numbers.

Shortly after returning, Demonoid site admins posted the following:


{{squote|Welcome back! Since a few months ago, Deimos, the site administrator, lacks the necessary time to take care of the website, because of personal matters he's been needing to attend to. For this reason, he has decided to leave the site staff. Before leaving, he assigned a new site administrator from among his friends to take care of the site. The old moderator team will continue helping with the site, unchanged. We will try to keep running everything just as it always has been. The trackers and website seem to be working properly, and should any issues arise, they will be taken care of as soon as possible. The site might be going on and offline over the next days as we work out any problems. Welcome back, and enjoy your stay!|Umlauf Demonoid Site admin}}
