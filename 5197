Mark of the beast
Have you ever been with a [[woman]], going at her, and as she [[orgasm|orgasms]], she claws at your back like a [[psycho|wild animal]]? No? Oh, wait, [[virgin|you're reading Encyclopedia Dramatica]], right. It happens sometimes- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaters_of_the_Dead in this book], for example. Viking chicks are ''rough''.

Well, imagine if a [[beastiality|dog]] is going at you [[anal sex|from behind]]. Vikings aside, little could be [[butthurt|more intense]] than the claws that bad boy's going to be driving into you. Noticing this, [[furry|furries]] immediately leaped upon such wounds as a status symbol, showing one's devotion to the [[faggotry|cause]]; and those who have been [[cum|anointed by the olive oil]] that issueth forth from the canine genitals are the first to [[yiff|eat the carcass of the pack's latest kill]]. And so the furry species lives on another day.

Suggesting that such ritual scarification is perverse or somehow morally wrong [[fursecution|is just close-minded and intolerant]].

==Christians [[less than three|<3]] Beastiality==
''Revelation 13:16  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads; 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.''

At the end of the world, the [[jews|sinful and wicked]] will accept a mark from a [[ohbutyouwillpet|beast that issueth forth from the sea]] that will allow them to buy and sell things. The [[Fundamentalist|just and righteous]] will [[victim complex|suffer under the beast's reign for a thousand years]].

Wait, why do I worship [[God]] again? This sucks.
