Trepanation
[[Image:Trepanation.jpg|thumb|300px|The procedure is [[bullshit|safe and painless]]]]
Not to be confused with "trepidation"; trepanation (aka "[[R. Lee Ermey|Skullfucking]]"), is a brutal and barbaric form of surgery in which a [[LOL WUT|hole is drilled or scraped into the skull]].  Ironically this is a pursuit that should be considered with much trepidation. Thought of by [[noone|some]] as the [[death|cure]] for [[emo|depression]], one of the techniques most vocal supporters is Bart Hughes who is sometimes referred to as "Dr. Bart Hughes" [[fake|though he did not complete his medical degree]].

In his book "Eccentric Lives & Peculiar Notions", John Michell describes a [[United Kingdom|British]] group that advocates self-trepanation, to allow the brain access to more space and oxygen. The chapter is imaginatively called "The People With Holes in their Heads".  Michell quotes a book called ''"Bore Hole"'' by Joey Mellen.  Joey and his partner had made two previous attempts at trepanning Joey. The second attempt ended up placing Joey in the [[science|hospital]], where he was [[troll|scolded severely]] and [[partyvan|sent for psychiatric evaluation]]. After he returned home, Joey decided to try again. <br><br>
{{quote|After some time there was an ominous sounding schlurp and the sound of bubbling. I drew the trepan out and the gurgling continued. It sounded like air bubbles running under the skull as they were pressed out. I looked at the trepan and there was a bit of bone in it. At last!|[[idiot|Joey describes his third attempt at self-trepanation]]}}

In 2000 an [[Anonymous]] [[idiot|Volunteer]] posted a series of TL;DR [[TLDR|journal entries]] about his [[fool|self-trepanation]] experience to [http://www.modifiedmind.com/ www.modifiedmind.com] which can be [http://www.bmezine.com/news/people/A10101/trepan/ read here].

Naturally it began with a huge number of [[unrealistic expectations]] such as ''"the key to a permanent consciousness increase was a hole in the skull, to restore the full brain pulsation of infancy.  The key to more consciousness is sitting in the next room over. How can I know this and not unlock the door?"''

After reporting that he [[gay|felt different]] for a number of days, which was probably due to a combination of the [[drugs]] he had taken to numb the pain and the [[goatse|shock of having a fucking hole drilled into his skull]], he decided that the uncomfortable and dangerous operation was full of [[fail]] and he now very probably had [[Aids]].

Trepanation is a cure for [[migraines]]. It works. Also cures [[satan|demon posession]].
