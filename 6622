==[[OL]] Profile==
An [[OL]] '''profile''' is a personal web page which is used by [[An_hero|angsty teens]], [[Ohbutyouwillpet|pedophiles]], [[Dwarlinggirlxcore|attention whores]], [[Duke Otterland|furries]], and many more social rejects in order to communicate with their peers over the [[Internets]] and/or lure their prey. Be aware that many OL [[16-year-old girl|16-year-old girls]] may not be who they say they are.

Many users use various colours and images in order to spice up their profile but usually end up with their profile looking like a Times Square whore.

This is used by the [[Police]] and [[FBI]] in order to learn more about their suspects before arresting them. Of course this is mostly false since proper police procedure involves beating the suspects with blunt instruments until they confess. All other methods are created by [[TV]] cop shows such as Law & Order.
The only cops show that tells the truth is COPS.
