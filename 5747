On '''December 10th, 2007''', Matthew Murray (aka '''nghtmrchld26 -htr f vwls''') -a 24-year-old wannabe [[list of sex moves|missionary]] from [[Colorado]]- said: "[[brb, church]]" and set out on a [[ruin|holy mission of ruin]] and to out-fail the [[Epic Fail Guy]] with <u>two assault rifles, three handguns and banana clips for additional ammunition inside his backpack with "[[Over_9000|more than 1,000 rounds]]" of ammunition</u>.

All this after telling the world of his intent in a [[Columbine]] influenced "[[ITT|mission statement]]", done in the obligatory fashion; by posting on [[B|/b/]]. However, Murray had been sending [[hate mail]] to the Youth With a Mission school for a while after they'd kicked him out a few years back. 

When the smoke cleared Murray had [[pwnt|bagged]] [[FAIL|four people]] (five including himself) and wounded [[shit nobody cares about|five others]] between the two crime scenes. [[B|/b/]] is currently disgusted with his [[e-penis]] [[kill ratio]]. [[EPIC FAIL]] achieved Matty.

Initial [[old media|reports]] tried to deny Murray of his [[an hero]]ics that would have left him with only four [[pwnt|confirmed kills]]. Reports claimed he had been [[pwnt|smote]] by the hand of [[Durova|Joan of Arc]] on behalf of [[dog|God]] before he could do any more damage. She has [[HAHAHA|since denied this]] and an autopsy confirmed that she also [[fail|fails it]].

Before [[Durova|Joan of Arc]] [[blowjob|"took him down"]], Murray killed sisters Stephanie and Rachael Works, aged 18 and 16 -- both members of the [[true believers|10,000 member]] Youth With a Mission -- in [[Ted Haggard]]'s '''New Life Christian Church''' which was packed with as many as [[sheeple|7,000 people]]. 12 hours earlier and 10 miles away, the 24-year-old had killed Tiffany Johnson, 26, and Philip Crouse, 24 -- two staff members of a Youth With a Mission center in the Denver suburb of Arvada.

Like Jesus, he was a kind man with a msg for us all. Crazy is "just a word, it has no meaning". Before the smoke cleared from his peace gun he uttered out his last words, a call for tolerance "everyone is different".

{{quote|"God was with me. I didn't think for a minute to run away. God guided me and protected me. It seemed like it was me, the gunman, and God.|Jeanne Assam}}

Ironically, the security guard who attempted to [[pwn]] him -Jeanne Assam (awe-som)- is being hailed for saving countless lives in shooting Murray outside her church, but she says [[magic|her steady hand was a matter of divine guidance]].

[[MILF|42-year-old]] Assam was a police officer in downtown [[Minneapolis]] in the 1990s, and is licensed to carry a weapon. She was part of a small team of [[brb, church|church]] members on guard duty yesterday at '''New Life Christian Church''' in Colorado Springs when Murray opened fire outside the building. This is the [[scam|mega-church]] founded by [[Ex-Gay|ex-gay]] Reverend [[Ted Haggard]].

She says she was weak from a [[pro-ana|3-day religious fast]], but when Murray came in with an assault rifle, [[lesbian|she shot him with her gun]]. She also [[fail|missed]] proving that God can't aim for shit..

==[[Conspiracy|Tinfoil Hat]]==

The [[Old_media|AP]] press release for this story was out in the Sunday newspapers but [[RONG|didn't really hit the Internets bigtime until the following day]]. [[Some_argue|Some believe]] that this may indicate the [[Christians]] set this up to feed the mass [[Victim_complex|victim complex]] that [[Americunt]] [[Christfags]] need to [[Waco|TAKE OVER TEH GOVERNMENT]].

Meanwhile [[pundit]]s and [[Christfags]] of all stripes are freaking out all over [[Fox News|the TV]] and in [[blogs]] that '''"OMFG...THERE'S A WAR ON CHRISTIANITY!"'''

==History==
[[Image:Azusa st survivors.jpg|thumb|He didn't survive.]]
[[Image:Witnessestoldpolice.jpg|thumb|"Witnesses told police that the gunman was a 20-year-old white male, wearing a dark jacket and skull cap, who left on foot. He may have glasses or a beard."]]

Matthew Murray tried to join the [[Xtian]] outreach group [[faggotry|Youth With a Mission]] several years ago to train in the mission's courses for globe-trotting [[bible thumper]]s who proselytize the [[bullshit|good word]] to [[atheist|heathen]] [[niggers|natives]]. Unfortunately, [[batshit insane|health issues]] prevented him from [[Heaven's Gate|reaching for the stars]].

Howevar whilst at the mission Murray revealed a [[Star Wars|dark side]]; that of a [[slayer|violence-espousing rock music]] [[fanboi]]. He was a total freak that imagined he was the [[Feltcho|Gollum]] from [[Lord of the Rings]] and scared the shit out of everyone. He eventually earned himself a [[banhammer]] for performing graphic Marilyn Manson and [[Linkin Park]] songs at the mission's otherwise [[boring|religious]] Christmas [[faggotry|program]]. He subsequently [[butthurt|spammed them]] with [[hate mail]] for five years.

'''[http://www.nationalterroralert.com/updates/2007/12/11/internet-forum-postings-may-be-those-of-colorado-church-shooter-matt-murray/ National Terror Alert]''' reported a series of posts believed to have been submitted by Matthew Murray, reportedly known online as '''"nghtmrchld26".'''"

The postings on an online [[forum]] for former [[fundies|Pentecostal]] [[fail]]fags have been [[baleeted]] but other users said the writer had described himself as a former member of YWaM who had been asked not to join a mission trip to [[Europe|Bosnia]] and now wanted to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|"blow up and shoot everything I can,"]] the website said.

==Internet Killer==
[[Image:Nghtmrchld26-profile-top.png|thumb|300px|Profile.]]
Before and between the two attacks, Murray [[post]]ed an anti-Christian diatribe [[OTI]] on a Web [[forum]] called [http://p223.ezboard.com/nghtmrchld26s-posts-on-12907/fexpentecostalforumsfrm60 Ex-Pentecostal-Forums] for people who have left [[fundie|evangelical religious groups]]. Most of his posts were on a [[board]] called '''Azusa Street Survivors'''.  

In his final post, time stamped at '''11:03 a.m.''' Sunday morning, -in the hours between his attacks in Arvada and Colorado Springs- he railed on Christianity posting under the [[screen name]] of '''nghtmrchld26'''.

[[asking for it|"You Christians brought this on yourselves]]!" Murray wrote, according to a news report which did not identify the site. "All I want to do is kill and injure as many of you ... as I can, especially [[Mel Gibson|Christians who are to blame for most of the problems in the world]]."

Earlier posts time stamped '''10:50 a.m.''' began with a [[kthxbye|goodbye]] to those he had [[cyber]]ed with for the past few months.

{{tinyquote|You guys were awesome. It's time for me to head out and teach these ([[FUCKING SANDWICH|expletive]]) a lesson}}

{{tinyquote|Thanks for listening and all ... even though even many of you ex-Pentecostals don't understand ...... See you all on the other side, we're leaving this nightmare behind to a [[Promised Land|better place]].}}

{{tinyquote|I'm coming for '''EVERYONE''' soon and I '''WILL''' be armed to the [[FUCKIN SANDWICH|@#%$]] teeth and I '''WILL''' shoot to kill!|Murray}}


After that final post, one of the other forum users realizes what's happened and wrote, "Oh noes. I just saw this on the news."

Another wrote, "Yes, please don't do it. You'd only make them into martyrs and yourself into a fanatical, hateful zealot, in the public opinion."

The only other post that referred to Murray was a user asking everyone to leave the site to chat about Murray elsewhere to avoid the media finding out.

==Teh Posts==

In one post the signature reads:

'''“This is the year where hope fails you……..we who have been the test subjects for their game called Christianity will run the experiments the church “expletive” you know are the heroes you hate but victory is possible if we strive there’s no reason, there’s no lesson no time like the present…. I’m telling you all right now what have we got left to lose? what have you got left to lose except your soul…who’s with us!…….”'''

In another,

'''“You Christians brought this on yourselves,” the poster wrote. “All I want to do is kill and injure as many of you … as I can especially Christians who are to blame for most of the problems in the world.”'''

In yet another entitled, [[jenkem|“secret addiction”]] he writes,

'''“I have found myself in deep trances and other worlds through the usage of this drug and have found my life radically altered and changed and by it. I found this drug to be a powerful driving force and easy gateway into a world of [[sex]], other [[drugs]], [[rebel]]lion, [[homosexual]]ity, [[alcohol]]ism and many other [[niggers|dark things]]. I have found such an [[Power Wrist|incredible power]] in this drug that will completely carry one’s mind away into a very real spiritual realm. My mind is completely controlled by this drug and there is no way at all for me to break free"'''.

'''"What is this mind altering life changing drug that has such an incredible power? Well, one of the main persons who has helped make this [[crap|drug]] a powerful force in my life has been Marilyn Manson……."'''

'''"The drug that I use and am addicted to is commonly known in our culture as… [[Metal|Rock Music]]."'''

He rambles on...

'''"This whole sex thing really discourages me. I didn't learn what sex really was until age 19....[[spellcheck|unfortanately]] not by hands on experience. I see all my friends and other people having sex, getting married and all while I can't hardly even get a date even though I'm in excellent shape and "groomed." I try to be nice and considerate and all yet I can never get a (female) date. I am at least able to get [[buttsecks|some male action]] but I wish I could just once be with a girl. It kind of sucks to be a young adult like this and to have never been with a girl.'''

'''Yeah, [[emo|I know I suck and a lot of people hate me]]...but there is hope for getting laid by the end of this year.'''

'''I'm working with Marilyn Manson, Decide, Cradle of Filth, Slayer, and Slipknot on this one......and meditating on Liber OZ to come up with some solution, some way of getting laid with a female by years end."'''

More rambling...

'''"Really, there's nothing wrong with [[cutting]], nor with [[suicide]], we're already going to hell for some stupid sin and/or not following the "true version of christianity." If you follow [[Brian Peppers|Bill Gothard]] but don't speak in tongues and/or listen to that rock and roll devil music you are probably already worshiping Satan and allowing demons to possess/opress you and into your home. Seriously, I doubt cutting or suicide is going to "cause you to go to hell more."'''

==What People Are Saying About Matthew Murray==
{{quote|[[spider expert|Now you'll see your star...]]|Murray's last words plagiarised from Manson lyrics.}}

{{quote|He also would talk to himself in the halting, high-pitched speech of "Smeagol" from [[LOTR]]|Richard Werner -former roomie}}


{{quote|Dude, I'm just talking to my voices (@Seaking: [[FUCK YEAH SEAKING]]!)|Murray}}

{{quote|[[batshit crazy|Richard ... you don't have to worry. You're a nice guy. The voices like you.]].|Werner}}

===Murray Remembered===

When Richard Werner saw TV reports about a gunman's [[pwnage|deadly rampage]] at the Arvada [[gay bar|missionary school]] he attended in 2002, he remembered the strange, teenage bunkmate who would '''growl and talk to himself in strange voices''' in the middle of the night.

At the time, Murray struck Werner as a [[socially awkward|painfully shy 19-year-old]] who, after being sheltered by a lifetime of [[home schooling]], had trouble [[so ronery|socially adapting to other young people]] at the Y-WAM center. "In the beginning he was just a [[13-year-old|nice quiet normal kid]]" Werner said.

Then Murray began to display extreme [[emo|"mood swings"]] — from [[ED|biting sarcasm]] to angering other guys in the 18-man dorm by spreading rumors of [[buttsecks|homosexual behavior]] in the shower and violating rules against smoking or [[list of sex moves|romantic relationships]] during the program.

Murray would [[fap|toss and turn]] in his bunk at night, growling and making slow [[swallowing]] sounds, Murray said. He also would '''talk to himself in the halting, high-pitched speech of "Smeagol,"''' the [[Hobbit]]-like character in the [[Lord of the Rings]] movie trilogy popular at the time.

===The Batshit Crazies===

One night Werner was awakened by Murray's talking in tongues and complained: [[lolcow|"Hey, Matt can you just stop that. What are you doing?"]]

"He just turned and said, '[[batshit crazy|Dude, I'm just talking to my voices]],'" Werner recalled.

"Richard ... you don't have to worry," Murray reassured him. "You're a nice guy. The voices like you. Please don't shoot me."

Unaccustomed to ritual [[trolling]] by other [[teens]] in the program, Murray would say: [[911|"I don't like the way Christians treat me."]] [[Mel Gibson|"Don't you think that Christianity is the reason for a lot of the problems in the world? Like war?"]]

===The Banhammer Falls===

The final straw was a Christmas celebration in 2002 where Murray frightened classmates by performing dark rock songs by [[Linkin Park]] and Marilyn Manson. The Linkin Park song  '''"One Step Closer,"''', an emo anthem  includes the lyrics "Cuz I'm one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break!" The song is bound by law to only be used in instances of [[Serious Business]]. If only the Christians knew of the stakes at hand when "One Step Closer" is played.  

While the gathering was [[boring|light-hearted]] — with others engaged in [[unfunny|comedy skits]] and mock [[Heavy Metal]] song covers — Werner said something about the performance by the normally [[shy]] teen freaked-the-fuck out of classmates.

{{quote|[[OMFG|This is kind of scary!]]|fellow students}}

Five days later, a YWaM principle called a meeting with Murray and his [[parents]] and lowered the [[banhammer]] on his final two-month missionary outreach training in war-torn [[Serbia|Bosnia & Herzegovina]].

===[[Butthurt]]===

As Murray walked out of the program five years ago, he approached a classmate with a strange farewell to the group.

{{quote|I have a message for everybody. Just tell them that now you will see your star|[[LOTR|Smeagol]]}}

The other students interpreted this [[Guess The Meme|riddle-like]] to mean: "I'm going to be a star some day," whilst [[some argue]] that he meant "[[internet tough guy|you will be seeing stars when I get done with you]]."

==His Message==
{{quote|I'm not crazy. Crazy is just a word|}}

''You christians brought this on yourselves.I’m coming for EVERYONE soon and I WILL be armed to the @#%$ teeth and I WILL shoot to kill. ….God, I can’t wait till I can kill you people. Feel no remorse, no sense of shame, I don’t care if I live or die in the shoot-out. All I want to do is kill and injure as many of you … as I can especially Christians who are to blame for most of the problems in the world. Well all you people out there can just kiss my (expletive removed) and die. From now on I don’t give a @#%$ about what all you (expletive removed) have to say, unless I respect you which is highly unlikely, but for those of you who do happen to know me and know that I respect you, may peace be with you and don’t be in my line of fire, for the rest of you, you all better @#%$ hide in your houses because I’m coming for EVERYONE soon, and I WILL be armed to the @#%$ teeth, and I WILL shoot to kill and I WILL @#%$ KILL EVERYTHING! No I am not crazy, crazy is just a word, to me it has no meaning, everyone is different, but most of you @#%$ heads out there in society, going to your everyday @#%$ jobs and doing your everyday routine (expletive removed) things, I say @#%$ you and die, if you got a problem with my thoughts, come to me and I’ll kill you, because……..God (expletive removed), DEAD PEOPLE DON’T ARGUE! My belief is that if I say something, it goes. I am the law. If you don’t like it, you die. If I don’t like you or I don’t like what you want me to do, then you die. If I do something incorrect, oh @#%$ well, you die. Dead people can’t do many things, like argue, whine, @#%$, complain, name, rat out, criticize, or even @#%$ talk. So that’s the only way to solve arguments with all you (expletive removed) out there, I just kill. God I can’t wait till I can kill you people, I’ll just go to some downtown area in some big city and blow up and shoot everything I can. You break my back but you won’t break me…..all is black but I still see…shut me down, knock me to the floor…..shoot me up, @#%$ me like a whore….trapped under ice, comfortably cold, I’ve gone as low as you can go….. feel no remorse, no sorrow or shame……time’s gonna wash away all pain I made a God out of blood not superiority I killed the king of deceit and now I sleep in anarchy.''

-'''Matt Murray on life 2007''' (and abusing KMFDM lyrics at the same time)

As a pious man he was kind enough to self edit out his swear words so as not to offend the people he was about to kill. Unless of course this was edited out by a 3rd party. If so, thank you for removing such [[offended|offensive]] language, I would hate to be upset by a story like this.
