'''Larry "Wide Stance" Craig''' is <s>was</s> the senior United States Senator from [[Idaho]], a [[hypocrite|"nasty bad naughty boy,"]] and total real-life [[faggot]]. He is a member of the GOP ("Gay Old Perv") party, and has been a Senator since 1991; he was a U.S. Representative from 1981 to 1991 and enjoys reading the M4M section of [[Craigslist]]. In 1982 he was accused of grade A faggotry with little boys, punishable by [[Jesus]], to which he responded by [[Deleting your Youtube Videos|deleting all of his YouTube videos]] whilst taking CNN off his friends list because it was [[asking for it|entrapment]] and they were mean jerk faces. When not busy supporting [[Scientology]] [[fanboi]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD3HKTt-MAU] [[Mitt Romney]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDeSfWIulw0], Larry can be found [[The Daytona Nine|tapping his foot]]. Immediately all Republicans ever invented in the history of ever wanted [[pwned|Senator Craig]] off their team in fear that he might spread the [[gay]], this is [[fact]]. The WHO responded by reporting toe tapping as the number one cause of [[gay]] next to [[anal sex]] and [[pedo|pedophilia]], all time honored past times of the statesman from Idaho.

On June 11, 2007, Senator Craig sauntered on in to a Minneapolis-St. Paul airport bathroom cruising for dudes, when he began trying to fondle an undercover officer; he was then arrested for [[troll]]ing for [[sex]] [[IRL]]. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct in August 2007, and decided maybe it was time to stop tapping his foot. He paid more than $500 in fines and fees, was given one year of probation [[ftw]]. A 10-day jail sentence was stayed, where Craig found [[God]] and sucked some moar [[cock]] in the process. Currently, he is extremely [[butthurt]] and "[[Not_gay|NOT GAY!]]" He is rumored to be clinging to life and is expected to [[Owen Wilson|kill himself]] in the near future.  But above all, remember that he is 100% NOT GAY.  He just enjoys the occasional assfuck.

==PLZ TAP FOOT==
[[Image:Tap_shoe.jpg|thumb|right|Officer Hank Hightower took this shoe into evidence]]
[[Image:Donging_it_wrong.jpg|thumb|right|Officers seized this still image from a concealed airport surveillance camera.]]
According to Roll Call, the arresting officer filed the following in his report of the incident:
{{quote|At 1216 hours, Craig tapped his right foot. I recognized this as a signal used by persons wishing to engage in lewd conduct. Craig tapped his toes several times and moves his foot closer to my foot...|Officer Hank Hightower}}

A spokesman for Craig described the incident as a '''he said/he said misunderstanding''' [[LOL]].
{{quote|I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct. I should have had the advice of counsel in resolving this matter. In hindsight, I should not have pled guilty. I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously. I don't do that kind of thing. I am not gay, and I never have been.|Larry Craig}}

Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, Minneapolis.
Cruisy toilet by the shoeshine, on the back side of the ticket counters. 
 
New comments added September, 2006:
"I was just there and it is still the place to go. 
I was in there all day and watched several men jackoff.
One was a TSA agent. He was jacking it hard and watching
me under the stall. We came so hard he could not help but
moan with delight. This is the place to be with a layover."

New comments added September, 2006:
Read about this hot spot today and stopped by after 
getting off my flight. I walked around the corner and a 
hot, tall, big-dicked man was stroking at the urinal. 
I joined in and motioned him into a stall, sat on the 
toilet and sucked him until he shot a huge man-load down 
my throat. I didn't get off so I killed some time, came
 back, stood at the urinal for a few minutes and another 
guy walked in, turned to glance at my cock, proceeded 
into a stall, I chose the one next to him and before I 
knew it we were grabbing each other under the stall.
 Then his ass came down and squatted and I fucked his ass 
until I blew inside. Hot!


FYI to visitors: it's the bathroom to the left 
once you get out of security checkpoint two. 
This place is unbelievably hot! I sat in a stall for 
less than five minutes and had two Northwest Airlines 
employees sit on either side of me, both tapping their 
feet. They took turns sucking on my cock under the stall.
 Then one passed me a note to follow him upstairs. 
We finished off in a little-used bathroom one floor up. 
I came back to play some more with the other employee, 
but he had left. It wasn't too much of a problem, however. 
The next guy to get in the stall next to mine was gym-built
and begging to get fucked. I will definitely come back to this spot!

In before tl;dr

{{quote|Saint Paul International Airport place is THE most cruisy public place I have been. If you enter from the terminal, turn left and go past wash basins, urinals to the back where the stalls are. Show at the urinals. I've been groped by the washroom attendant and this past week at 9:30am, there were three uniformed flight crew in the stalls. After getting my cock hard, I turned to face the stalls and a guy with his pants off was on his knees sucking the guy in the next stall. Most of the time guys have their travel cases blocking the view under the stalls. He didn't. Wide open. In the next stall, the guy opened the door with his pants around his ankles, shaved, cock ring, and hard as a rock. He pulled up his pants and came out to join me at the urinals and stroked my 9" cock while jacking himself off in the urinal. Had to cover twice. Very exciting, but I didn't have time to get blown like the last time I came through. Unbelievable. Makes me hard just thinking about the place. Only thing missing is a gloryhole.|anonymous}}

==Further Faggotry==
[[Image:Cloudoveridaho.JPG|thumb|A cloud has been placed over Idaho.]]
In October 2006, gay activist blogger Mike Rogers, who has earned a controversial reputation for outing political conservatives, alleged on his blog that Craig was gay. Craig responded by calling him a faggot and masturbating to his image.

On August 28, 2007 the Idaho Statesman published a series of allegations about Craig's sexual activities, and his responses to them, that it had withheld until his conviction came to light:

* A college student who was considering pledging at Craig's fraternity at the University of Idaho in 1967 told a reporter for the Idaho Statesman that Craig led the student to his bedroom and "made what the man said he took to be an invitation to sex." Craig responded: "I don't hit on any men."

* A gay man told a reporter for the Idaho Statesman that, in November 1994, Craig cruised him at the R.E.I. store in Boise, following him around the store for half an hour. Craig responded: "I'm not gay, and I don't cruise, and I don't hit on men. I have no idea how he drew that conclusion. A smile? Here is one thing I do out in public: I make eye contact, I smile at people, they recognize me, they say, 'Oh, hi, Senator.' Or, 'Do I know you?' I've been in this business 27 years in the public eye here. I don't go around anywhere hitting on men, and by God, if I did, I wouldn't do it in Boise, Idaho! Jiminy!"
    
* A professional 40-year-old man with close ties to Republican officials "reported having oral sex with Craig at Washington's Union Station, probably in 2004." Craig responded: "'''I am not gay and I have never been in a restroom in Union Station having sex with anybody.'''"


'''December 2nd 2007:''' [http://www.idahostatesman.com/localnews/story/226703.html '''Holy Shit''']!  Sloppy [[Ted Haggard]] Seconds!

The Idaho Statesmen claims that Mike Jones, [[Whore|former prostitute]] and favored by nine out of ten upstanding politicians for meaningful [[Ass Rape|political conversations]] with people like The Rev. [[Ted Haggard]] last year first said he would not touch Craig with a his mother's ten foot dick. But, eventually confessed. Jones says Craig paid him for sex in late 2004 or early 2005.  Seven more men have said they have had [[buttsecks|sexual relations]]

{{quote|"It is unfortunate that the Idaho Statesman has chosen to continue to lower itself to the standards of what can best be described as tabloid journalism,"

"Despite the fact the Idaho Statesman has decided to pursue its own agenda and print these falsehoods without any facts to back them up, I won't let this paper's attempt to malign my name stop me from continuing my work to serve the people of Idaho."|Larry Craig.  [[Fag|Still Not Gay]]}}

== He's All About The [[Shitty|Dirty]] Bear Sex ==

[[Image:Daniel_Phillips.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[http://wonkette.com/politics/larry-craig-scandal/exclusive-i-had-sex-with-larry-craig-314897.php Larry Craig loves teh bear sex]]]
'''Daniel Phillips''', a past buttsecks partner of Craig's has recently revealed that Larry [http://wonkette.com/politics/larry-craig-scandal/exclusive-i-had-sex-with-larry-craig-314897.php will fuck the shit out of your ass]. 

(..thats really all that needs to be said): 

<pre>

“...He stripped me down, and the man’s hands 
and mouth were all over me.
He kept his pants on, though, while laying me back on the bed to 
suck my cock. Then, he stripped naked and asked me 
to suck him. I complied for a while, then he disappeared 
and returned with lube and a condom 
to fuck me me with. It was a clumsy and unremarkable fuck, 
except that I wasn’t clean and he 
was frantic about not getting my shit on anything. Still, 
he blew his load, ripped the dirty 
condom off and ordered me to get dressed without 
wiping myself. He hurried me to the back 
door, again ranting, ‘You were never here.
 You don’t know me. Right?’” 
</pre>

==Trivia==
[[Image:Queer times of sothern idaho.jpg|thumb|right|The paper of record.]]
*Even though Senator Craig is a [[fag]], he supports the Federal Marriage Amendment, and voted for cloture (aka Rule 22?) on the amendment in both 2004 and 2006. He voted against cloture on a bill in 2002, which would have extended the federal definition of hate crimes to cover sexual orientation even if they were [[furries]].
* Voted YES on prohibiting same-sex marriage. (Sep 1996)
* Voted NO on prohibiting job discrimination by sexual orientation. (Sep 1996)
*HOLY SHITE!:In 1995, Craig formed a barbershop quartet called The Singing Senators (of Doom) with Senators Trent Lott, John Ashcroft, and James Jeffords.
*The most serious finding by the Statesman was the report by a professional man with close ties to Republican officials. The 40-year-old man reported having '''oral [[sex]] with Craig at Washington's Union Station, probably in 2004'''. The Statesman also spoke with a man who said Craig made a sexual advance toward him at the University of Idaho in 1967 and a man who said Craig "cruised" him for sex in 1994 at the REI store in Boise. The Statesman also explored dozens of allegations that proved untrue, unclear or unverifiable.
