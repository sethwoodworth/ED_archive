Wikipediametric/Cabal tactics
{{main|Wikipediametric}}

The following is delicious copypasta from [[wikileaks]] of selected quotes from the Wikipediametric mailing list archive describing the tactics of various [[Wikipediametric]] cabal [[penis|members]]. Despite all this damning evidence, the stupid Wikipedos are still going to let the web brigadiers off scotch free instead of doing the smart thing and permabanning these noobs.

==Digwuren, aka Cabal Ringleader==
*<20090102-2219>
:"We might consider adopting as standard tactic the practice that before the 3RR report is filed, somebody else should add a 3RR warning to the user's talkpage."

*<20090123-0814>
:"I have been working on a wiki engine (. . .) I will set us up a copy for private use.  For one, it can be a place to store battleplans and comment on them without strangers being able to misinterpret them, without the volatility of mail in a list. (. . .) Wikipedometer's data storage can keep deleted revisions of pages, or full histories of deleted pages"

*<20090205-1911>
::"Piotrus: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive34#Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration.2FEastern_European_disputes]]

:I responded, in what's a risky move but with potential for considerable payoff.

:Essentially, I believe this a good candidate for Cristian's suggested "At long last, have you no sense of decency left?" manœuvre.  But for it to stick, I may need somebody else to back me up when Deacon's ire is turned against me."

*<20090209-1035>
:"I think I know a reasonably safe place to provoke BFF [User:Beatle Fab Four] into 3RR.  See <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Victory_Day_(May_9)&action=history>.

:Who wants to participate, and when is a good time?"

*<20090216-1322>
:"> Either way, I consider Jehochman dangerous, and will seek to "poison the
:> well" re his neutrality in a few days.  I hope to make it socially
:> unacceptable for him to take administrative actions concerning me in the
:> future.  Ideas are welcome, and somebody please support me when the time
:> arrives -- because I can't do this alone.

:I have left a message to his talkpage, and his response fits with my scheme nicely.  Please join in.

:The plan is to develop appearance of a minor personality conflict"

*<20090321-1545>
:"His tendency to hang around AE combined with his peculiar personality traits, for lack of a better euphemism, are threatening to develop into a serious problem.

:Should anything preemptive be done about this?  For instance, I could imagine me posting a medium-length whine to AN/I about how Jehochman has been mean to me even though I attempted to make up with him.  At least in 2007, this used to work."

*<20090326-2003>
:"Petri Krohn [User:Petri Krohn] at the Nashi press conference [+video]"

*<20090328-1138>
:"I've created [[Wikipedia:Finnish Anti-Fascist Committee|Finnish Anti-Fascist Committee]] based on news reports, and created redirects of all members to this page.  This means that [[Wikipedia:Johan Bäckman|Johan Bäckman]] as well as [[Wikipedia:Petri Krohn|Petri Krohn]] are currently redirects to this article."

*<20090328-1329>
:"Somewhat surprisingly, Offliner has shown up and is demonstrating a willingness to edit-war. I need backup."

*<20090331-0910>
:"Would it make sense to create a navigation box on historical revisionists? (. . .) An important but not immediately obvious result of such a template -- if we could make it stick -- would be that due to the connecting links, Google would begin associating Bäckman and Dyukov with the well-known historical revisionists such as Miguel Serrano, David Irving, and Harry Barnes."

*<20090403-1312>
:"Wikipedia discussion culture is dead.  There's no point in trying to convince William of this important issue -- since he doesn't trust us, he won't hear us.

:Instead, we'll have to make sure to back each other up.  The maximum number of reverts that is reasonably safe to do in any day is two. When those two reverts are up -- and preferrably even earlier --, call in reinforcement.  Experience tells us that when the edit history of an article looks like a checkerboard of two editor's edits, administrators like to blame both editors -- but when there's one editor against several others, administrators tend to think the single editor is editwarring.  Of course, if several teams are reverting each other, the article may get protected."

*<20090404-0946>
:"he also published a street address in Australia and Google Street View link that supposedly showed his garage and his car.  FayssalF oversighted the edit shortly afterwards, claiming "outing".

:By the way, do you happen to remember the name?  It would be interesting to see if Google knows anything about him."

*<20090521-1520>
::>"Digwuren: See here: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tiptoety/Archive_25#Digwuren_using_Wikipedia_as_a_soapbox]]

:I'd like to thank everybody.  This line of attack has been successfully deflected."

*<20090601-0858>
:"I think sock accounts should be shared between wildly differing people of wildly differing habits.  This tends to neutralise personality quirks, confuse Bayesian statistics, and with some luck, also draw less attention.  Also, manufactured personality and spelling quirks are probably useful."

*<20090601-1731>
:"Which means that either a proxy is needed, or the behaviour must be such that a technical checkuser will never raise.  Or preferrably, both."

*<20090605-2009>
:"One of the classic tactics involves overwhelming the opponent's revert count.  To do this, we'd have to coördinate at the level of determining a day and consistently revert him (and the rest of the Cartel) until 3RR kicks in.  The obvious downside is that a tight series of reverts such as this has the risk of catching administrative attention, with all the consequent risks."

*<20090607-1308>
:"Happy happy_ joy joy  PasswordUssername has earned his first block.  It's a 3RR block after he filed a false 3RR report on Sander.

:It demonstrates the dangers inherent in 3RR reports.  The maximum reasonably safe number of reverts per day on any article is two; when you need more, call somebody else to help."

*<20090609-0909>
::">Piotrus: Length. A lesson for the future: try to avoid discussions at 3RR. Now the admins are looking at it in disgust, and it is likely to be closed as "stale minor violation, no result.

:Except when an ally is being threatened by a 3RR block, of course.  Then, lengthy discussions are a handy tool for risk reduction."

*<20090610-1054>
:"I've started [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject Estonia#Nazi attack noticeboard].  It permits more flexible coöperation with people not in our mailing list (probably most importantly Termer), and it gives us a handy excuse for appearance of coöperation when PasswordUsername begins insisting that there is a cabal.  Because, as we all know, coöperative behaviour on Wikipedia is a Bad Thing."

*<20090611-2155>
:"Finally, Dwiki can be usable for developing articles before copying them to Wikipedia.  Reverts are much easier to mask when they're mixed with small improvements -- and small improvements are easier to find if they can be copy-pasted :-)"

*<20090612-0943>
:"Check out the comparative threads at AN/I.  Once we've gotten AE done with Shotlandiya, Peters can lift his thread -- together with the numerous diffs -- to AE, as recommended by Sandstein.  PasswordUsername has nothing that can be used at AE; he's back in square one. He certainly made an attempt, but I don't see anything that he gained.  He lost a chance to attack Sander, however, which is a good thing. (. . .)

:I'm considering account replacement.  Block log is like underwear: it should be kept clean.

:I'm also planning to do a number of other spelling and wording quirks.  Perhaps I can write a tool for Dwiki to do pre-specified quirks automatically, so Molobo can return, too. (. . .)

:Piotrus, would you consider issuing an outing block to PU [User:PasswordUsername] if requested? (. . .)

:It does not matter if the block is later removed.  The only consistently referred record of reputation on Wikipedia is the block log, so it might even be beneficial to first issue a block, clearly mentioning WP:OUTing in the block summary, then tweak it, then, after discussion with the user lift it before expiration with a summary saying something like "PasswordUsername regrets; the  block is provisionally lifted".  That's three block log entries for price of one.  Plus, if Piotrus lifts the block himself, even Deacon won't be able to claim that the block demonstrated some sort of anti-PU bias."

*<20090612-1039>
:"With a new beginning, I should be able to pull off an RFA within a few months if I'm careful. I can express a different interest profile for the few months; in particular, refrain from controversies and play the silly countervandalism games instead. And if I'm not planning to go for Piotrus' Project Checkuser, I won't probably have to be very careful about IP addresses, either. In order to give a reasonable cover for my disappearance, I can post a "How doth Wikipedia suck? Let me count the ways ..." rant, indicating that I'm off to build a better Wikipedia, perhaps with a reference to Citizendium. By the time of the RFA, the three-month checkuser staleness limit will have passed, and as I noted previously, administrators are a pretty invulnerable bunch covered by WP:IAR."

*<20090614-1419>
::">Sander Säde: probably Digwuren will be hit by another ban,
:Which means that I'll disappear by the arbcom time, if not before."

*<20090615-0741>
:"One possible rôle would be that of a descendant of Russian expatriates who have made their home in, say, America.  Such a person could be searching their roots, and thus, show interest in everything Russian, perhaps even some radicalism, but could have an excuse for speaking very little of Russian for reasons such as "My parents always spoke French at home".  First-generation immigrants trying to enhance their children's integration can do such things deliberately, so it's plausible.  And a grade 11 or 12 student would be a teenager, so he can also plausibly express his disappointment over his parents for doing it. (. . .)

:Make sure the full name is reasonably common, yet not conspicuously so.  Or alternatively, lampshade its commonness.  Don't rush offering a full name in the first place.  Speak of generalities, such as a nice ice cream stand run by some Grigori, who taught you to spell your name in Cyrillic and liked to tell stories about Grigori Rasputin.  Naturally, the Cyrillic name would have first name and patronym, while Western telephone directories and other googlable material commonly has first name and last name, so non-googleability would be excusable.  Perhaps start a LiveJournal under the name a few weeks before the Wikipedia affair, and make sure it googles."

*<20090616-1120>
:"Speaking of provocations, is my last notice to PU over the top?  I want it to look like an innocent attempt to "reach over the aisle" to any reasonable third party.  Any irritative effect will need to be contextual."

*<20090618-2004>
:"Russavia and Deacon are still important targets."

*<20090619-1112>
:"Also, please do try to soup up the dramu, as Piotrus suggested.  The point is to demonstrate that as a vexatious litigator, Offliner has generated dramu-prone meritless two requests that are very complicated to handle properly."

*<20090621-2115>
:"True.  You don't say it out loud if you want to win a wikibattle.  Only fools and loners are allowed to tell the truth."

*<20090629-1940>
:"I'll study the document Piotrus linked to, and after a while, create a new account specifically to pass an RFA.  Meanwhile, I might write an article or two for on-Wikipedia use, but the collaboration wiki problem still needs some sort of solution.  If Peters can set up a MediaWiki, great.  If not, I'll see if I can smuggle the necessary hardware into a friendly server park, or possibly get Dwiki to parse MediaWiki syntax properly."

*<20090705-1017>
:"It reinforces my preconceived notion that Thatcher is suffering from the preconceived notion that there's an "EE cabal" which needs to be "rounded up".  He's brushing Radek with "no stranger to controversy" because his pattern-seeking mammalian brain has drawn a (not entirely invalid) connection between Radek and the "EE cabal", and he really doesn't care if Radek *individually* merits sanctioning."

*<20090707-0759>
:"The point that I'm not editing with this account will help me to avoid checkuser with my next account."

*<20090731-0918>
:"Minor disagreements on-Wikipedia are OK, and actually encouraged -- it makes it harder for anybody opposing us claim that we're sockpuppets of each other --, but Poeticbent has been under severe risk of banning on Wikipedia for months now.  A push like this can realise this risk, and that would be rather problematic. (. . .)

:Poeticbent, as Piotrus said, please avoid continued reverting.  Wikipedia is notorious for lax enforcement of all sorts of policies, but it sure loves the 3RR policy -- because it's so technical, so easy to assert and enforce.  If you find an opposing party is reverting you repeatedly, call in help through the list.  There are about ten of us; we can easily out-revert any single opponent *and* thus demonstrade wide consensus if it's necessary.  Then, 3RR will work for us, not against us."

*<20090904-0723>
::>Jacurek: "I'm not sure if you checked, but I follow your advice already and I did only up to 2"

:"I'm sure Piotrus knows it.  But Thatcher ... well, that's another story.  So, Piotrus knowing that *pretends* to Thatcher he's handing out stern useful advice, which possibly mollifies Thatcher.  It's just politics, don't take it personally."

== Piotrus, aka Deputy Cabal Ringleader ==

*<20090102-1220>
:"This is the third and last time I'll ask for help dealing with Irpen-like clone, Donald. (. . .) As I've been reminded by ArbCom to ignore edit warring, I am trying to s[t]ay on 1-2RR a day in that article, so I cannot by myself ensure it is correct."

*<20090102-2138>
:"I reported him (Donald) and he got the critical failure on the random admin draw, with a week block and a final warning - more than I'd expect, but I am not complaining :>
:I have a feeling blocking admin didn't even read the Donald's block log 
:carefully, as despite its length, he has only two real blocks, and only 
:one of them, from half a year ago, for edit warring:
:http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User%3ADonaldDuck
:A good illustration of the theory that the length of your block log MATTERS A LOT."

*<20090113-0209>
:"The real battle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Is_ArbCom_a_reliable_source.3F  If we can gain consensus there, we can use it as a wedgehammer at the article proper."

*<20090205-2011>
:"Peters, if you are reading it, if you could weight with your experience of MK and me, this would be a good time and place  :) 

:Others may just want to post a general puzzlement along the lines "Why is Deacon targeting Piotrus again, like Irpen did in the past?""

*<20090206-1904>
:"Note: before ArbCom, we could launch an RfC about Deacon - this may be a good way to irritate him and gather info on who else would like to see him taken down a peg..."

*<20090215-2055>
::"> Digwuren: Either way, I consider Jehochman dangerous, and will seek to "poison the well" re his neutrality in a few days.  I hope to make it socially  unacceptable for him to take administrative actions concerning me in the future.  Ideas are welcome, and somebody please support me when the time arrives -- because I can't do this alone.

:Even not knowing him previously I've criticized him on ANI. This should be a good start."

*<20090402-2239>
:"This only speaks of the need not to revert by yourself more then twice a day and if reverts are needed, request them here or on IMs or such. Revert warring by yourself leads only down this path. Learn from it."

*<20090402-2358>
:"I told you before you need to just IM me and ask for a revert...  :) "

*<20090404-0611>
:"Please consider commenting at the requested move here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Vilnius_(1655)#Survey If we can make Deacon lose some temper, this could be reported to AE/ANI."

*<20090406-1831>
:"A few comments at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Vilnius_(1655)#Survey may be helpful, as there is a good chance that Deacon will fly off the handle with other bad faith accusations, particularly if he recognizes some of his former foes. He already ranted at ANI about the Polish cabal again, so why not make him rant about some larger conspiracy :D"

*<20090407-0501>
:"I've now split this part of the discussion into a separate section, which I expect he will try to revert. If and when he does so, it would be bad style for me to revert but if other editors could come into the discussion, restore the heading  (this is how it looks in the version with my subheading: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement&oldid=282275111#Off-topic_discussion_concerning_Radeksz) and comment that the entire Radeksz discussion is off topic and irrelevant, this would be appreciated. Deacon in the past has gotten into revert wars about headings and such on AE / ANI and similar pages, and another example of him warring on (disrupting...) such pages would be useful in the upcoming arbcom case."

*<20090407-1620>
::"> Martintg: Looking at the AE noticeboard you linked to below,  I see Deacon mentioned your recent closure of a 3RR report on behalf of your colleague: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring&diff=prev&oldid=268517532 Do you think Deacon may attempt to exploit this in an upcoming arbcom case you speak of?

:This will not work; he already tried to bring this to arbcom and got badly smacked down  :) "

*<20090407-1621>
::"> Digwuren: Tavix has offered to nominate Biruitorul for administrator."
:"Good plan, I will try to attract some Polish editors to the vote if needed. Is Biru in our list? If not, I think we should invite him."

*<20090407-2254>
:"We really need more admins on our teams, I have already once been accused of doing favors on ANI/3RR, we need more people to be able to step in."

*<20090412-1948>
:"Per a recent suggestion, I invited Biophys and this time he agreed"

*<20090426-2019>
:"you may want to write something about you respecting Russavia's edits, assuming good faith and just wanting to clarify a certain, non-personal issue. The bulk of the discussion should be handled by others. Feel free to requested specific comments to be made, I am not following that discussion very closely but I can certainly try to steer it to a certain degree.

:If it hasn't been done yet, all editors who in the past expressed concern about this editing pattern of Russavia should be informed of this AN thread by email."

*<20090428-1957>
:"A very good point, which is why my position on AN is now 100% "damage control" - i.e. torpedo any attempt to create a "consensus" that Biophys is stalking. I'd highly advise other members of our little group to post a message there strongly opposing this idea."

*<20090429-0549>
:[concedes that an organized Russian team is BS] "I am sure that Russia could easily afford to swamp us with editors - they don't need many, just a few would be enough. The fact that we are dealing with on average one to three POV-pushers suggests to me that they we are dealing with unorganized Russian nationalists, with little connection to the government."

*<20090506-1615>
:"Is actively edit warring at http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tsarist_autocracy&diff=288275925&oldid=288214708 Help appreciated, I would like to avoid more then 2 reverts per day..."

*<20090522-1545>
:"Check this out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2009-05-18/Multilingual_contests

:Perhaps our Estonian colleagues could try to contact them to get them interested in the slightly more useful English Wikipedia?"

*<20090524-1506>
:"On strategy:
:<nowiki>* considering your poor reputation, I'd suggest that the RfC should be filled by somebody else. Woogie10w may be the best choice, as he is not a Pole, and he is sympathetic to you, alternatively, you could try asking Tymek, or maybe Radekesz or me if Woogie will not do it.</nowiki>
:<nowiki>* in that case, you should either reword the statements "I did something" to "Molobo did something", or cut this evidence from this version and post it as yourself after the RfC is opened by Woogie.</nowiki>
:<nowiki>* considering that it is possible you'll be banned on May 29, I think it is imperative that the RfC is started before this, and that you post your evidence to it before May 29</nowiki>"

*<20090601-0734>
:"That's all I have to say, other whenever Molobo comes back, his new account should behave sufficiently different to deal with future "behavioral analysis"."

*<20090601-1727>
:"The problem with sharing accounts (which is forbidden - remember Russavia's recent case) is the CheckUser IP trace. If it could identify that an IP is shared, let's say, between several of us and Molobo, it would be BAD.

:Perhaps some kind of a proxy would be useful?"

*<20090601-1730>
:"Here's another hint for Molobo: contant the unfamous user Serafin, a permbanned sockpuppeteer who returns like a Boomerang, and try to work out something with him."

*<20090601-1733>
:"Yes, but don't bother with normal unblock (well, you can, but I estimate a chance for its to work is 1%). Contact the blocking admin and ask for a reduction, citing the arguments I gave you before"

*<20090601-2122>
:"Let's try to convince Avi to reduce the length of the block: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAvraham&diff=293801631&oldid=293739271 "

*<20090602-0618>
:"One could then try to use limited time socks: edit for a month, and change the account, before this name becomes associated with the given edit pattern/formerly known editor."

*<20090602-1859>
:"Yeah, with this (http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Radeksz&diff=prev&oldid=293991369) he is looking at a ban. I am too tired to report him myself, but this and some other recent diffs is enough rope to hang him easily :)"

*<20090603-0726>
:"Everyone else who has already commented at Avraham talk could try baiting Deacon into another anti-P outburst; I've already replied to him at http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAvraham&diff=294030252&oldid=294029001 Each evidence-comment he makes is one diff closer to taking him down. Just remember - don't say anything that may be used AGAINST you. We have to be paragons of virtue :)"

*<20090603-1312>
:"Looking at who is active and interested in wikipolitics on Polish Wikipedia, how about considering Jacurek for membership in our cabal? (. . .) I know Tymek very well, even met him briefly f2f and can vouch for his integrity, he has also helped me with reverts and similar issues"

*<20090604-1923>
:"Yes, I got some emais from him [User:Woogie10w]; he doesn't seem very.... stable. I wouldn't pass any confidential information to him (like the fact that we have our email cabal list :>)."

*<20090605-2029>
:"He [User:Kurfürst] is also annoying some other editors there; there is little harm in wikiemailing them to sound them out and later innocently bringing WP:DIGWUREN to their attention  :) "

*<20090606-0618>
:"A crucial point is to avoid reaching 3RR, since people with streaks of three reverts per day have been known to get punished for edit warring. If we can coordinate reverts so that none of us has 2 reverts but Offliner has 3 reverts, after a relatively long streak on several articles he should fall for edit warring at ANI/3RR."

*<20090606-0903>
:"I was thinking: the fact that our current listserv does not eliminate headers is a potential security risk. With headers, it is much more difficult to deny autorship of an email if it is leaked by forwarding. If we could adjust the listerv so that it wouldn't be forwarding headers, this would improve the security of our list."

*<20090606-0919>
:"I think we need to plan long term, and get a CU of our own. This will involve first getting an admin status, and then, CU. I don't think I am likely to get CU myself, if for nothing else then that I am not involved and not interested in dealing with CU issues, and one will have to prove that one is interested in CU issues unrelated to EE for that.

:In order to do this, I'd suggest that one of us excercises the WP:Right to vanish to clear his name from any association to Poles/Batlics/etc. that would be likely to draw opposition "because of his friends" and creates a new account, one that would for the most part avoid interaction with EE issues, and would become increasingly involved in anti-vandal / admin issues, embarking upon a track for adminship and then, CU (it may be worthwhile to analyze edit history and pattern of existing CU and emulate them).

:Who could do this? It has to be somebody with a clean record, to avoid being compromised in the future along the lines "you hid your bad block log" - I would not put it above CU to run checks on their future buddies. WP:RTV gives an editor the right to discard a previous identity, but hiding a bad block log (Dig or Molobo - sorry guys - sorry :>) could sink our plan. Per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOCK#Inappropriate_uses_of_alternative_accounts I am afraid that such an account would also mean retiring the old identity, and not running other socks. Any thoughts who would like to embark on such a wiki-life changing move?

:Do note that becoming a CU is only slightly less difficult then becoming an ArbCom member...: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CheckUser http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/CheckUser_and_Oversight_elections http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/CheckUser_and_Oversight_elections/February_2009

:On a related note, we have previously discussed admining more of us; I think it is still possible. Vecrumba is the most likely candidate (clean block log, lack of wiki warring) for that. Tymek has a clean block log, but little interest in wikipolitic/adminship issues (correct me if I am wrong?). Radeksz has only one 3RR block, it should be possible to bypass that, same for Marting; Miacek's record also seems defensible. Any other candidates? Do note that once you reach admin level, you are that much closer to CU.

:Considering the pool of our members, I think that getting a few more admins is possible, but getting a CU will take time (years?). Still, if we don't try..."

*<20090606-1529>
:"Keep sending us the diffs here, and we will keep reverting him :) [User:Skäpperöd]"

*<20090608-0903>
:"I suggest that the ani thread should be entitled "abuse of admin privileges". As winning this is crucial, not only for Jacurek but for taking down Deacon,  I suggest we try to mobilize all of our resources here - but let's not spam the thread (particularly by users in not-so-good standing), instead I'd suggest we reach out to friendly admins and ask them for involvement (it may also be worthwile to see if Deacon has other enemies and inform them of this thread - he is involved in some other arbcoms and such). I'll be contacting a few people as soon as the ANI thread is posted.

:PS. As agreed before, I've asked Jacurek if he wouldn't like to join our email list."

*<20090608-1119>
::"> I'll be contacting a few people as soon as the ANI thread is posted.

:I've contacted AGK and Darwinek. Radeksz, Jacurek, Tymek - please contact Darwinek as well, he is a Polish admin that used to be active in wikipolitics.

:Any suggestions who else to contact would be appreciated; perhaps Radeksz could ask Sandstein?"

*<20090608-1735>

:Don't revert more then twice on article per day, unless you are dealing with clear vandalism or a solely noobie/ip that will not have cabal support.

:Or you are an admin (but even I try to avoid 3 rr). Which reminds me: we should really start thinking about getting adminship. Who wants to go first and SOON? We need to try our strength at RfA."

:"Again, this is a very good argument for those of us who can to start seriously consider getting an adminship. As long as you are a normal editor, there is a chance an admin will decide the stars are shining wrong on you and block you."

:[on infiltrating pro-Russian editors:] "Well, we don't have to go that far. They may welcome a leftist commie / Russia / Putin symphatizer, living in a Western country, likely of Russian descent but not 1st gen, so one for whom Russian is not a primary language (hence no need for Cyrillic keys). Add to this strong desire for privacy and anonymity, and there is little need for any major back story."

*<20090615-1742>
:"I am sorry to say, but inactive cabal members are nothing but a potential security risk.

:"Let's face this: your current account names are pretty muddy, and it is more and more likely some future restriction will be pretty bad for you (it is likely to be bad for both sides, but that's a different issue). But if your accounts were to drastically limit their activity or become inactive, and new ones were, well, new and better behaved, ArbCom could be convinced to ignore you due to you being inactive."

:"Indeed. From my 5 years of Polish editor on Wikipedia perspective, I take it as a good sign that on the Russian front, we have defended the neutrality of Polish topics, and are now taking the fight to the enemy, and are able to defend our (mostly Baltic) allies. (. . .) Logistics, for me, is stuff like this list (an expanding it), getting our own MediaWiki set up (on which we could design ready-to-be pasted Rf...s), learning how to use IMs for insta-speed reverts and alerts, and stuff like that."

Heck, inactive admins still retain their admin flag even if the leave the project... once you are an admin, you must really and ACTIVELY mess up to lose it. I do hardly any "admin" work regularly - I rollback some vandalism I stumble upon, delete an occasional page, and that's it :) "

:"I note that Thatcher did not set up a duration on his 1RR blocks. That's bad, since it prevents one from vanishing with a clean (no restrictions) record. I will ask him about that; if he refuses to add a lenght to them I suggest that in half a year those of you who want to vanish ask for a review of their behavior and lifting of this restriction (which should happen if you will not break the 1RR in that period), THEN vanish."

*<20090630-2207>
:"Somebody with a little time should look at their [User:Skäpperöd, User:HerkusMonte] recent diffs, as things are going on AE those days, just a brush ups with 3RR in the past month or two may be enough to give an editor a 1RR or a topic ban :( Idiocy, but if one side is throwing nukes, well..."

*<20090701-0204>
:"I strongly encourage adopting voluntary 1RR for a while. Let's try to use our numbers to deal with them, if they do more than 1RR a day they should become objects of Thatcher affection :)

:I am almost thinking that considering his irrational attitude (sanctioning editors who are reverting like 0.25 a day on a given article) it may be a good idea to create SPS to take care of reverting. As long as the socks are not identifiable, and if they do only a few reverts before being retired, they should not be easy to identify with existing editors... I hate to suggest such an option, but if he is going to sanction people for a few related reverts over a period of a month, we have to consider such actions."

:When this happens, Martin can step up and say to William: there are two ways to respond to such edits: 1) give up editting the article and let it be owed by the offender, or 2) revert with the risk of getting 3RR reported and mud stuck at you. And then we all can step up and say that it is abnormal to be put in front of such an alternative, and that William should do something to avoid in the future such dilema-situations.

:1) It needs to be a separate computer and a separate IP address, untraceable to our accounts, otherwise we can be blocked (their revenge for treason would be mad, plus this would show to admins a spirit of increasing the level of fight, the permaban is guaranteed)

:2) Cyrillic keys. It is possible to install them, but secondary things must also be in Russian, not just the content of emails. Compiling a list of such things is a challenge already.

:3) Acting, and I mean talent. Not everybody can do this. The story must be big and full, with tons of details. They should be able to see the email path to a country and city were there is plausible to exist Russians. Also you have to be able to tell stories about that place, and be able to tell something about the Russian community there. Even better would be if "your full name" was googleable. Not having any traceable details would raise suspicions.

:Interestingly, but you know, many secret services have started this way... :) I mean if you go back 100 years ago. For example, the Chinese Communist Party had a secret service since 1920s, and it started with a number of guys like us. I once read a book about this.  :):):)"

That is the standard "wooden language" that I apply to him: "please, refrain from reverts and engage in discussion". When his behavior would be discussed, he would know he had annoyed you in "other" ways. 

:Hint: he is a deep communist believer. Any blatantly anti-communist edit is like red to him. Use this in case you don't know how to annoy him. Once you annoy him, blame him for being too rush and for not engaging in discussions. Occasionally you can let him do some "damage", so he can accumulate a negative record. Check his "contribs", and if you find an article close to what you have been editing in the past, do some anti-communist edit there."

:"A lot of this comes just from the fact that the sock puppet always
:can't help themselves and end up being very topic specific. (. . .)
:and the way to beat that is to throw in lots of noise into
:the data so that no correlation comes out significant. And that means
:just taking the time to edit completely random articles totally
:unrelated to the sock master's area of interest. Basically something
:like, every other day clicking the "random article" link, taking
:whatever shows up, doing a quick web/google books search on it and
:making even a minor edit. It's extra work but no one said sock
:puppeting is easy.
:What's harder to hide (and I think this is what clinched the case
:against Molobo) is the temporal correlations - in Molobo's case the
:fact that his and Gwinn's edits were always hours apart (and I think
:here the secret evidence basically just suggested some kind of

: *We do have superior numbers - this matters, although it is not all

: editing conflicts it is something like  = numbers*(reliable sources
: squared))*(square root of experience) (last one for avoiding 3RR

: *Most of our opponents are inexperienced in relative terms to us,
: older folks like Ghirla and Irpen having been driven out. This leaves
: people like Deacon, and perhaps a few unfavorably disposed admins
: (also some among the Greater Germany editors but that's more of a
: Poland-specific problem and a number of them, like Matthead, make up
: in sheer stupidity for what they've gained in experience)

: *We are probably better organized - and by that I don't mean just this
: list, a lot of this organizations formed informally at some level
: before; I started watching a lot of you guyz's edits long before I
: joined this list - this is also a function of the experience.
: (. . .)

:The Tactics is all the blocking and banning we want to get and how we
:get it. It mostly covers all the AE, ANI, 3RR etc. cases that we want
:to file and also how we defend against those cases which are filed
:against us. Whether to be quiet, or whether to stir up dramu.
:Assessing who is the biggest threat and what are their weaknesses;
:edit warring, incivility, other. Which editors should become engaged
:when and when should they stay out. Which editors that are not on this
:list can be regarded as close allies (Mosedchurte, Colchicum, etc.)
:Which admins are favorable. Longer term, per Piotrus' suggestion, it
:involves getting more of us into the ranks of admins, or pulling the
:vanishings to clear the records.

:Logistics is the actual content related stuff - coordinating the
:reverts when needed so that no one violates 2RR, creating appropriate
:articles (like the Historical Truth Commission), exposure of created
:articles (which includes getting some of this stuff up on DYK and
:getting it to GA/FA status), talk page discussions and related
:matters. Remember that this is about information, but information not
:only has to be created  but also disseminated. Also very importantly,
:finding reliable sources since that pretty much renders the text
:untouchable"

*<20090621-1911>
:"It'd probably not be a good idea

:"he very clearly means to send a
:direct threat here and scare Piotrus. But of course, in the world of
:Wiki hypocrisy, direct threats violate good faith and incivility so
:it's best to leave as little evidence of the threat itself as
:possible. So after sending the threat, you redact it to something much
:more nicer and cuddly - then the object of the threat has probably
:gotten the message, while you've only "discussed" things with them.

:be commended instead of having abuse heaped upon them. Overall for the
:most part they've decided cases correctly (include some examples where

:"As long as we're being devious here, what about "Kamikaze Sock" accounts?
:In your typical case to get somebody for edit warring you have to create the opportunity for them to revert a lot. But if you're doing this yourself then that means that you expose yourself to charge of edit warring as well. Alternatively, a few of us can get together and uh, well, tag-team, but then we get accused of tag-teaming.

:Instead if somebody makes an IP account, makes some minor edits to establish a minor history and then basically "sleeps" until a relevant dispute develops, then comes in, reverts a few times, gets the other side to revert a lot - then they both get restricted but the Sock was a throwaway account anyway and the other side has a blemish on their record.

:In a weaker way that's essentially what that annoying anon is doing to us on the Poland/German pages.

:To make it work the IPs would probably have to be created by someone in a big city, the background history would be on articles only weakly related, and care would have to be taken so that whatever edit summaries/comments are made don't resemble the main account - faking bad English might be a good way to go. 

:It might not work the first or second time so multiple "sleeper" accounts would be a good - the idea being to substitute the quantity of multiple "throw away" accounts for quantity of edits and not give CU much to work with.

:Of course the strategy has big potential danger so maybe editors with less too loose - those already under serious restrictions, like mayb Molobo, would be the best candidates."
