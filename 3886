[[Image:BEAMS OF KILL.gif|frame|IRL memes are the only thing more [[retard]]ed than [[old memes]]]]
An '''IRL meme''' is similar to a [[meme]] on the [[internets]] execept it is [[IRL]]. Due to the fact that IRL memes cannot be transmitted by anything more advanced than the [[old media]], they tend to stay within one local group. Much as memes are in-jokes with the entire internet, IRL memes are in-jokes with a smaller social group.

== Examples of popular IRL memes ==
* [[Forced Memes (Television)|TV ads]]
* [[fail|Disco]]
* [[Final Fantasy VII]]
* [[Racism]]
* [[Religion]]
* Yoyos
* [[Sex]]
*[[Sex|"That's what she said!"]]

== How IRL memes are formed ==

[[IRL]] [[meme]]s are [[sex|formed]] in a similar fashion to normal memes. The big difference is that IRL memes require a persons presence when the meme is created for them to get it. Internet memes are transferred easily because they're [[funny]] to everybody, not just the first people to see it, IRL memes aren't usually that funny to people who weren't there when it was created. Usually IRL memes are created due to something awkward/[[funny]]/[[awesome]]/[[sexy]] happening

== Transition memes ==

Sometimes [[old meme]]s on the internet can become IRL memes among [[geek]]s, or vice-versa.

Some memes that have entered the real world include:

* [[All your base are belong to us]]
* [[Numa numa]]
* [[Goatse]]
* [[Fail]]

Some memes that have come to the internets from the real world:

* [[God]]
* [[Divide by zero|Dividing by zero]]
* [[Shit Bricks]]
* [[Imma Let You Finish]]

== WTF does that mean? ==

Most IRL memes mean nothing to people who aren't involved and when you try to explain it, you just look like a fucktard and whoever your explaining it to almost never laughs. Examples of IRL memes include:
