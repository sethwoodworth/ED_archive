Drama War
Sometimes a [[drama]] gets so intense and so vile, a [[war]] breaks out. It usually happens in a situation when [[Internet drama]] and [[IRL drama]] collides with each other to create an entirely new kind of superdrama, which has not been witnessed by [[scientist]]s until recently. This type of war usually consists of two groups, one which has a group of clinically insane people with hordes of inbred mongrel followers, and the other consists of [[EDiots|freedom fighters]] of Dramatistan. The first group is often looked upon as the [[victim]], the [[lilo|innocent bystander]], and the later  group is marginalized by being labeled as [[hater]]s, [[terrorist]]s. However, if we look closely at the [[fact]]s , we find quite the opposite. These so called victims are often [[pedophile]]s, [[furry|sexually deviant]]s and/or just plain [[attention whore]]s. On the other hand, the freedom fighters achieve martyrdom by sacrificing their lives for sanctity of [[LULZ]]. 

[[E-lawyer]]s, and in extreme cases, [[V&|IRL Police]] get involved in Drama Wars. Although it is strictly forbidden to have business deals with [[jews]] because their appetite for [[money|Jew Golds]], during war times it is permitted to use Jew lawyers as weapons.


== How to start a Drama War ==

A great example: "Fuck everyone who's ever contributed to this page or who has ever read this page. I hate you all and I hope you all die. I'm going to kill myself tomorrow and you're never going to see me again." - This is a great way to start a Drama War within any community. Saying those words will not only start flamewars, but inner-social wars of the website, and quite possibly the most amusing [[lulz]] you will witness.
However, if you are an [[attention whore]] and post that, you will most likely be [[lulz|lulzed]] to death, and your plan will backfire.

Some drama war veterans give their recollections on previous battles and opinions on how to [[win]] drama wars:
{{quote|...this is like... we are fighting drama war on two fronts. I hope we do not fail like the fucking [[German]]s|sherrod, During [[Argent009]] [[Youtube Street Team]] and Michael Crook drama wars a.k.a Winter Campaign of 2006}}

{{quote|we have drama warriors in here worth ten thousand lolfantry each|weev}}

{{quote|..dont be disheartened by our current bogdown in dramiraq. It SEEMS like the enemy is swarming ... HAVE FAITH, STAY THE COURSE.|[[hep]]}}

As long as you stick to your guns, don't let morality get to you and as always: document, destroy, [[lulz]], winning a Drama War is not as hard as it looks. Remember, you're not doing it for your self, you're [[IDIFTL|doin' it for the lulz]].
