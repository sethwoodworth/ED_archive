Fry Guy
'''Fry Guy''' was an old-school [[Hacker|hax0r]] who earned his nickname by hacking into a local [[McDonald's]] computer and giving raises to his hamburger-flipping [[friends]]. In 1989, Fry Guy was responsible for redirecting calls to Palm Beach County Probation Department to a [[phone sex]] [[whore|worker]] named Tina. He was arrested and charged with 11 counts of computer fraud, unauthorized computer access and wire fraud, and was sentenced to 44 months' probation and [[At least 100|400 hours]] of community service.

==Legends Are Made, Not Born==

Fry Guy ([[IRL]] name unknown) started his hacking career rather inauspiciously. He was born and raised in [[Indiana]] and sought ways to rise above the crippling [[Boring|boredom]] that is so pervasive in flyover [[America]]. Fry Guy found his calling in computers, namely on [[Telnet]]. [[Telnet]] offered the teenage Fry Guy an opportunity to [[unwarranted self importance|rise above]] his [[mundane]] classmates, to be part of an [[Anonymous|elite hacker upper class]] who freely traded their secrets and methods on the burgeoning [[internet]].

Fry Guy idolized his hacker forerunners. He frequented message boards and chat rooms across the world. The people who worked these boards - the young IT professionals who would later form the companies who would build backbone of the internet - were impressed with the attitude and skills of the young hacker. Fry Guy shared information with the hackers that showed an impressive command of how systems worked, and how to exploit the [[retard]]s who were in charge of them.

==[[Social engineering]]==

Calling Fry Guy a [[1337]] hacker is a bit of a misnomer: we should instead call him a '''social engineer''' - or a person who uses his superior knowledge to [[ruin]] the lives of the [[I GOT NORTON!|stupid and misinformed]] for [[I did it for the lulz|fun]] or [[profit]]. Fry Guy earned his [[nickname]] during one such incursion; using the Sprint [[Telnet]] system used by [[McDonald's]] payroll to give his [[420chan|unwashed burger-flipping stoner buddies]] raises without the knowledge of their manager.

Early success emboldened Fry Guy. He decided that he would have to showcase his mad skillz in an [[Catnarok|epic battle]] against [[the man]]. His target was one of the most accessible systems of the time: [[Bell|BellSouth]], now a part of lumbering behemoth AT&T. Ma Bell was one of the main targets of early hackers. A whole generation of "phone phreakers" (best personified by [[pedophile]] [[Captain Crunch]] and [[pretty cool guy]] [[Woz]]) had made a cottage industry out of scamming the phone company. And Ma Bell deserved it. They had a crippling monopoly extending back to the days when the only person with a working phone line was named Bell. While an antitrust lawsuit in 1984 had stripped some of Bell's power it remained a [[Microsoft|huge, evil corporation]].

BellSouth had just installed a whole brand new infrastructure in [[Florida]], including digital call centers which needed no operators and could easily handle the increasing load of information brought about with the information revolution. However, Ma Bell [[Idiot|didn't want to pay for such things as security]] or [[Stupid|complicate things with passwords to restrict access to the centers]]. This left their systems as open and exploitable as [[Femse|your mom's distended asshole and vagina]].

Fry Guy experimented with wire fraud at first, using his knowledge of Ma Bell's systems to route calls from Western Union through a [[7 Proxies|bajillion proxies]] to a pay phone. The unsuspecting caller assumed that the person on the other end was the person who had asked for the original transfer, confirm the transaction, and rout the money to Fry Guy's accomplice. It's estimated that Fry Guy scammed a couple grand out of the system with absolutely no repercussions.

==[[Rape Clock|Oh My, Look at the Time]]==
Finally, the time had come for one of the most reported/funniest moments in hacker history. One epic night - June 13, 1989 - every single call to the Probation Department of Palm Beach County in Delray, [[Florida]] was routed to a [[New York]] [[phone sex]] operator - using less than ten lines of code in the process. Hundreds of calls from parolees and employees were given over to an increasingly frantic [[slut]] named "Tina."

If Tina was getting confused about her popularity amongst Floridian men, then Ma Bell was [[Delete fucking everything|having a fucking fit]]. They promptly sent out security experts to the offending switching station, intending to put pressure on the wound before the entire system bled out. What they found was mayhem. Not only had Fry Guy [[rape|freely accessed]] the system, but hundreds of false accounts, phone numbers registered to nobody, and malicious code had infested their system. What they had on their hands was a level-one [[script kiddy]].

Some time during this chaos, Fry Guy silently disconnected from the system, laid low, and watched his fame rise. BellSouth employees spent months [[abortion|un-raping]] the system and undoing the damage.

==[[Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this]]==
Fry Guy might have had the brains to keep his head down for a while, but he was only a [[13 year old boy|15 year old]] at the time of his intrusion. He just had to brag to somebody. After all, the premiere [[dork]] magazine of the time, [[2600]], had given the story feature coverage. He just had to gloat. And gloat he did. [[Stupid|He called up Bell employees]] to point out that he was the [[Samuel L. Jackson|coolest mofo on the block]].

However, by this point, the [[Secret Squirrel|Secret Service]] was involved. They had more than enough resources to bring to the task of catching this little punk before he made anyone else look like [[Gemma Anscomb|total assholes]]. They put sniffers on Bell employee numbers and within a month had tracked the hacker down to his [[redneck]] hometown. Soon after they put Dialed-Number Recorders (or "pen registers") on his phone lines, recording his every move and uncovering evidence of wire and credit fraud, along with stealing long-distance time from Bell. Thus began the [[rape]].

==Aftermath==

When the smoke had cleared, Fry Guy had gotten lucky. The feds had taken all of his equipment and information. Fry Guy was charged with 11 counts of computer fraud, unauthorized computer access and wire fraud. He was sentenced to 44 months' probation and 400 hours of community service. All things considered, [[Kevin Mitnick|it could have been worse]], and Fry Guy was saved mostly by his age.

Early hacker groups who were associated with Fry Guy were decimated, most famously the Legion of Doom and some [[German]] groups he had passed [[dox]] to. Fry Guy's identity remains a mystery to this day, but many hackers agree, he was one of the last of a generation: one of the true greats to emerge before the decimation of the [[Eternal September]].

*[[Fact]]: Fry Guy is also the old nom-de-guerre of those pom-pom looking retards from early [[McDonald's]] advertisements. They're now called "Fry Kids" to appease the [[feminazi]]s. [[Shit nobody cares about|Now you can't say that that ED hasn't taught you anything.]]
