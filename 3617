Harassment
{{Elaw}} 
'''Harassment''' is the gravest of [[E (prefix)|e]]-violations.  Internet Code 12, paragraph 13, subsection A defines harassment as:
:the intentional [[spam]]ming, [[image macro]]ing and commenting on someone's e-persona for the express and malicious intent of being mean, making them cry or stealing their friends or otherwise harming their e-celebrity status, realized or not.

Many [[e-lawyers]] avoid harassment cases in [[Internet court]] like [[IRL]] lawyers avoid class-action lawsuits.

Legislation is under way in the e-courts making it a punishable offense to file frivolous harassment suits.  [[LJ Drama]] is heavily lobbying the piece of legislation into reality.

*In the case of ''[[hepkitten]] vs. [[mediacrat]]'', the e-courts awarded Mediacrat [[:Image:Check.jpg|$10,000 US]] in the most severe ruling seen on the [[internets]].
*[[Belt0033]] attempted enacting an e-restraining order in response to harassers but lacked the support of e-lawyers and the e-courts themselves.
*In the case of ''[[Snapesnogger]] vs. anyone sane'', DeviantART handed out blanket bans to anyone not kissing the [[Wat|offendant]]'s ass raw in comment form. Trumped up charges include allegations of [[/b/]] affiliation (regardless of [[fact]]) and harassment charges over a single post.
