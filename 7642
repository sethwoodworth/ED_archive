[[Image:Uk-riots.jpg|thumb|"Anarchist student" who is actually a SWP member kicking in a window in London, Britfagland]]
[[Nazi|The Socialist Workers Party]] are a [[porn|nudes uploading]] [[communist]] [[Illuminati]] that was founded over [[100 years ago]] and [[Pathetic|would rather kindly HAWHAW like to suggest]] a [[IRL]] [[DDR|revolution]]. Their leader is [[Zombie]] [[Karl Marx]], a notorious Anti-Semitic Jew[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Jewish_Question], they follow his every word. When they are not following his word they sell pamphlets and newspapers explaining how to [[The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas|transform into a homosexual comrade]], they pretend to be [[Anarchist]]s, take over [[students|Britfag student protests]] and encourage [[Students|over-priviliged retards]] all to go [[batshit|crazier than Britney Spears on a coke and LSD bender]], smashing in windows along the way. SWP are in a sacred war with [[Rich|Bourgeoisie]], [[BNP]], [[Nazi|EDL]], [[Tory|Tories]] and even [[you]]. It's all about the counterculture [[loli|bbz]]. I'm a Trotskyite. Cigarette? Fancy a shag? [[No|Would you like a paper]]?  

==Newspaper==
SWP sell a shitty communist newspaper called the "Socialist Worker" that no-one buys on the street, usually outside demonstrations for a cause. Any cause. Including legalizing [[Pedophiles]]. Other causes they support include [[bitches|equality of women]] and helping [[Terrorists|asian]] people attacked by Neo Nazis. They also sold papers at the WTC the day the attacks happened. SWP DID WTC.

===Rich Lesbian Lady from Britfag Newspaper Trolls "Comrades"===

Brit fag newspaper [[The Guardian]]'s [[disability|staff lesbian]] called them [[truth|old]], unhip, pointed out that in the 21st century nobody wants to read their own shitty [[newspaper]] and that only an empty room was interested in paying to join to set fire to London because they could [[Do it faggot|do it anyway]]. The SWP made a [[failbook|facebook]] [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sour-faced-Socialist-Worker-Vendors-AKA-Revolutionary-Smiles/175541789144500 page (may the lawlz be with you)] proving they were [[lies|still cool]]. troll it by adding the photo on the left to their gallery until they ban you. do it for lulz. do it faggots. dance dance revolution, comrades!

'''They bitched about this quote:''' 
{{quote|Of course, the old left is not about to disappear completely. It is highly likely that even after a nuclear attack, the only remaining life-forms will be cockroaches and sour-faced vendors of the Socialist Worker.|[[lesbian|Laurie Penny]]|http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/dec/24/student-protests-young-politics-voices?INTCMP=SRCH Guardian|}}

The SWP got massively burt[http://www.zgeek.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=40902&cid=18] hurt about all of this. Zombie Karl Marx awakened from his slumber and demanded Egor, pronounced "Alex" fix it all [[stat]]. 

[[Image:Megaphonecarryinggaylord.jpg|right|thumb|Great Leader [[srs|Al]] sour facedly associates with students. Or other rich people to be more technical]]
====But WAIT! there's more====
[[Image:Mongler returns.jpg|left|thumb|[[Everybody|Nobody]] is being brainwashed here. [[Run_Chubby|Move along]].]]
[[RAGE|Not happy]] with the SWP being frontally assaulted, [[Hitler|SWP LEADER]] Alex Callinicos [[doing it wrong|used his position as a Guardian comment writer]] to attack Lesbian lady. He kept quiet about the fact [[holocaust denial|he actually runs the SWP in the article]]. [[Brainwashing|Obviously that wasn't important]].

{{quote|Penny's polemic was [[Butthurt|uncharacteristically ungenerous]], picking out [[Truth|"sour-faced sellers of the Socialist Worker"]] as symbols of "[[communists|the traditional hierarchies of the left]]", and [[Truth|comparing them to cockroaches]]. In fact, Socialist Worker has simply been where it has always been, [[lies|in the thick of the struggle]] – with the students in 2010, as it was with the dockers in 1972, the miners in 1984, the [[Nobody cares|Genoa protestors in 2001, and the anti-war marchers in 2003]].|[[Hitler|The Great Leader]]|http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/dec/26/student-protests-laurie-penny?INTCMP=SRCH Guardian|}}

You'd think disclosing that the person complaining about lesbo dyke [[Seriously|FUCKING RAN THE SWP]] would be important, but of course full disclosure might reveal the [[Brainwashing|Guardian is a peddler of actual Communism]].

==Jake Smith==
Prominent "inner circle" member of SWP Jake Smith posted his nudes online on NewbieNudes and has since [http://www.newbienudes.com/profiles/viewProfile.asp?id=2584012 BELETED IT]. Go on his [http://www.facebook.com/JakeIzaakSmith facebook profile] and send them to all of his friends.

== Drama ==
'''While requiring a little [[leet|knowledge]] of SWP's bullshit, posing as a Marxist can result in much [[lulz]] and [[butthurt]]:'''
*Compare their Fist hand gesture to the Nazi salute and point out the Nazi salute was adapted from 1920's US [[Socialist]] ran schools where children did it in the morning whilst doing the pledge of allegience.
*Say that Socialism is Fascist.
*Compare Stalin to Hitler, then compare him to Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro. For added lulz, find out their fave Commie country and compare the leader to Stalin and his purges. Then Hitler.
*Tell them that the SP, or Socialist Party is the only real Trotskyite party, and that they talk the talk but do not walk the walk. 

'''To troll any nearby New Labour mouth breathers, try the following:'''
[[Image:Marxpimp.jpg|right|thumb|Reppin' the Proletariat 4lyf yo'.]]
*Mention the failure of the [[Armenia|Soviet Union]].
*Mention [[Taiwan|China]]'s booming, capitalist economy (compared to the utter shithole it was when [[Lmao Zedong|Mao Zedong]] was in charge).
*Say Marx was a dirty nerd who needs to bathe.
*Pointing out Marx was actually a Anti-Semite with a book called "On the Jewish Question".
*Come up with some bullshit about how Marx would have loved the [[In Soviet Russia...|Soviet Union]] and the People's [[China]]. Make sure to say he was probably [[bear|gay]] or into Scat. The more [[lie|falsified]] information you present complete with straight face the [[Lulz|lulzier]] it will be.

==How the Magic Works==
The SWP is "run" by a Central Committee which can elect a Central Committee at a [[Convention|National Conference]]. In 2009, the members of the Central Committee included Chris Bambery, Alex Callinicos, Chris Harman and John ‘I’m Working Class’ Rees (who resigned). Chris Harman and Alex Callinicos (one of a middle-class background, the other is an [[Rich|aristocrat]]) have been in the Party for a long time and have sold literally [[old meme|over 100]] books to [[losers|people who like reading books written by the SWP]]. 

The National Committee consists of 50 members elected annually at National Conference. [[Communism|You can only elect members who agree with the Central Committee]]. Members who agree with each other can meet up with other members and then [[dictatorship|agree with each other]]. At  councils two delegates from each branch, who agree with the leader of the branch and the Central Committee, can put their hands in the air as the need arises. Possibly.

Other prominent members include John Molyneux, Rob Owen and Pat Stack. None of these figures are known to people outside the SWP (or its far-left rivals), but they are known to the people who know them. Nudge nudge, wink wink.

The SWP has a ‘industrial department’ which [[recycling|hands]] out old scrolls by [[Leon Trotsky]] to union leaders, made in a cave by Bob Crowe when he is not forcing everyone to [[unemployment|strike]]. Bob also informs them as to [[Doing it wrong|how misinformed they are]]. The SWP incorporates the [[middle class|Socialist Workers' Student Society]], which is actually the whole of the SWP (apart from ex-students who are leaders - but only if they are [[rich|loaded]]). These societies run meetings such as ‘[[Pretentious|How to master the cockney accent]]’, ‘[[Lying|How to pretend that one’s parents aren’t rich]]’ and ‘[[brainwashing|How to memorise the party line]]’.

==Revolution cancelled due to bad weather==
Currently the SWP is in a very weak condition with very few members so the revolution won't be happening this month.

'''The long term strategy of the SWP is as follows:''' [http://www.urban75.net/vbulletin/threads/291069-What-is-the-long-term-strategy-of-the-SWP]

* Act like insufferable wankers.
* Slag off the activities and principles of useful people while being useless.
* Take all the fun of everything they are involved in.
* Meetings. So many meetings. Oh dear god the meetings.
* Keep printing that fucking awful paper. 
* When the revolution finally happens despite their knack for stagnating genuine popular movements like a fat bloke with a rucksack at the front of a punk gig, they take all the credit. Then they have all the real revolutionaries rounded up and shot and promptly set about rebuilding hierarchy, beuraucracy and oppression until they are much the same as they were before but with more gulags. And more meetings.
* Repeat until the sun explodes.
