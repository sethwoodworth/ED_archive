'''STC''' is an Anonymous archivist and awesome investigative enturbulator from [[London|Loldon]]. Much to the dismay of Scilon [[English|Limeys]] (Slimeys?) STC cranked up a web site at [http://scientology-london.com http://scientology-london.com], and proceeded to obtain photographs and dox for every Scilon in Britain. 

His collection is astonishing and hilarious, as most of the photos are of Scilons at play, or doing goofy things in their leisure time with their fellow cultists. Along with the photos, STC has learned all kinds of weird, embarrassing and personal stuff about these Scilons that they themselves have posted at various [[Social networking sites|"social media"]] sites on the web. In many cases, a fair number of [[mods|Admins]] of [[Failbook]], [[MySpace]], and various other such sites, have passed along Scientologist-related materials when they have encountered it, even those materials secured to [[You have no friends|"Friends Only"]] or [[You|"Just Me."]]

STC has taken [[Pedobear|a particular interest in the younger Scilons]] who had attended the notorious [[Jenkem|"Greenfields"]] boarding school and indoctrination center.

Because it is England, the Scilons there are foaming at the mouth even more than usual, as they make [[lolsuit|feeble gestures to sue]] STC.
