Jamie Lynn Spears
{{Spoiler|YOUR MOUTH CAN'T GET PREGNANT!}}
[[Image:Jamiemovie.jpg|thumb|right]]
As if one attention-whoring [[Britney Spears|Spears]] is bad enough, now we have to deal with '''Jamie Lynn Spears''' - Britney's [[prostitot]] younger [[cumslut|sister]] who felt that she wasn't getting enough attention.  In response, she made the logical choice and threw out the condoms in order to score a few minutes of airtime on the Today show by becoming a [[teen mothers|teenage mommy]].  Many people thought Jamie would be better than her sister, but it turns out she is actually just faster.  This act of [[pregnant|preggortry]] has sparked an international [[lollercoaster]] and has prompted [[at least 100]] nicknames such as "Juno Lynn Spears", "Zoey XY", and "Total Douchebag Moron."

==So Stupid==
[[Image:Lynnsplooge.gif|thumb|right|She looks aroused by it]]
Spears is the star of a [[loli|preteen]] [[Soap opera|daytime television soap]], a role model to millions of young girls who aren't cool enough to hang out with the Hannah Montana fans. Of course, now she's gone and gotten herself [[pregnant|knocked up]]. In the old days, a [[16 year old girl|sixteen-year-old cash cow]] with a bun in the oven would be spirited away by rich studio executives to [[Falcon_Punch|be kicked in the fucking stomach]], but Jamie instead decided to [[dumbass|go public about it]], because babies are the newest fashion statement. Of course, she [[fail|fails]] even harder because everybody knows that the ''real'' [[Madonna|trend-setters]] go and buy starving black person from [[Africa]].

==Is the Father a Steady Figure?==
[[Image:Preggy Lil' Skank.jpg|thumb|right|Someone Shoop Me]]
When asked whether the father, [[nobody|Casey Aldridge]], was a steady boyfriend, Jamie Lynn had only this to say:

{{Quote|I have no steady boyfriend. [[slut|I kind of just keep my options open]] (as well as my legs).|Jamie Lynn Spears}}

Considering that she's ''living with'' her baby-daddy, and has been for quite some time, no one is sure what the hell would constitute a "steady boyfriend" in her world.  Then again, she was raised by the same dumb bitch who made Britney the fine, upstanding young lady she is today, so we can maybe forgive her for being a little confused.

Under normal circumstances Casey Aldridge would now be a registered [[child molester|sex offender]], for [[pedophile|having sex with a minor]] as well as black person.  However, since the law never applies to celebrities, this won't be a problem. 

==A Cover-Up?==
[[Image:JamieLynnSpearsBukkake.jpg|thumb|right|Jamie Lynn's new job after she's fired from Nickelodeon]]
A recent article on [http://www.showbizspy.com Show Biz Spy] and US magazine that's making its rounds on the internets now reports that the Spears' family and their friends think the [[rapist|father]] of the [[retard|child]] is a much older Nickelodeon studio executive, who could be looking at [[CP|child molestation]] and ''real'' rape charges and become the target of a [[whore|Spears family]] [[lawlsuit]] as well.

A recent claim from the Spears family states Casey Aldridge could not have knocked up Jamie Lynn Spears, because:
#Despite the fact they were living together, the Spears family claims that Casey and Jamie were not steady; they were seeing each other on and off.  Given the fact that the Hollywood standard for "steady" is [[lulz|twelve fucks]], [[marriage|wedding]] and a sex tape, this may make sense.  It is also reported that Jamie wanted to date [[Idiot|Kevin Federline's]] brother. [[LOL_WUT|WHAT???]] If Aldridge is not the father, Jamie Lynn was most likely [[win|molested]] by this older executive [[for great justice]], which means booze or other [[jenkem|intoxicants]] could be involved.  Or maybe not.  Whores have a way of fucking without anything in their system.  It's also possible that she may have been afraid that her career would be on the line if she didn't screw said executive, but this is highly unlikely, as she's probably too stupid to understand the concept of a "career."  Plus, this baby also threatens her career, so she'd have [[fail|put herself in the same position that she was hoping to avoid]]. Then again, she is a celebrity star of a popular sitcom - which means she can just pay a nanny to take care of her [[children|queef product]] while she goes to [[prostitute|work]].
#According to the family, Casey was a notorious [[dick|cheater]] and had a [[It's a trap|pregnancy scare]] from another [[slut|girl]], who conveniently had a [[abortion|miscarriage]] two weeks later.  If this theory goes, Casey was picked by the executives and their lawyers and paid off to claim to be the father. Of course, if he did have a preggers scare with [[Paris Hilton|another skank]], it's still possible that he's the [[child molester|father]].
#Witnesses report that the real father fired the fateful money shot from the grassy knoll.

On the blog [http://www.crazydaysandnights.net Crazy Days and Nights], which is written by a unnamed Entertainment Lawyer, this blind item was posted on Oct 5 2007:

[[Image:Jamielynnspears.jpg|thumb|right|Britney 2.0]]

{{Quote|#1 I don't even know how you define what list someone is when they are on some ensemble show watched by teens and pre-teens, so go with the above, and make her a female. Make her pregnant which is causing the producers to have a heart attack because they really don't need anymore scandals. But wait, there's more. One of the producers who is old enough to be her grandfather shouldn't be having a heart attack because of shock, because he is the one who knocked her up. New boyfriends are being lined up as we speak.|Ent Lawyer Oct 5 2007}}

Now if that does not forecast the Jamie Lynn Spears LULZ...

Now here is a new blind item!  It seems that this "[[pedobear|producer]]" has a bottomless appetite for the [[loli]]:

{{Quote|So it turns out that Jamie Lynn Spears wasn't the only person that our producer had a fling with.  No, it wasn't anyone on Jamie's show. But, it turns out he has made a habit of doing the same thing in the past to a number of different other 'tweeners. Not necessarily getting them pregnant, except for one very big exception.  Most of the time our producer would just make advances on the lesser stars of the shows he worked on, but the one other time he got someone pregnant was someone who is a much bigger star than Jamie Lynn was or is.  In that instance, the actress got an abortion and a healthy sum of money from the producer.  Everything was hushed up because the show was making way too much money.|Ent Lawyer Jan 3 2008}}

Now if the story of Jamie Lynn and this [[Pedobear|older executive]] pans out, expect Nickelodeon to get sued by her money grubbing whore of a mother and a visit from the [[FBI|Party Van]].

In other words, the lulz have not yet begun in this story.

This was expected, what do you think was going to happen when you send a [[loli|13 year old girl]] to live alone with her [[douchebag|19 year old boyfriend]], and work on a TV show run by [[pervert|sleaze-bag]] executives?

I bet [[Vanessa Hudgens]] is feeling pretty good about herself right now.

==Slut==
Casey Aldridge, realizing this was a major cock trap, threw Jamie Lynn Spears to the curb.  In light of the rumors of this unknown TV producer (according to the latest issue of In Touch Weekly) he is demanding a paternity test:

[[Image:gotmilk.jpg|thumb|right|Enjoy these tits, in 9 months they are going to sag.]]

{{Quote|"He wants a paternity test," Britney told the Spears family friend, according to In Touch Weekly. "Casey doesn't want to be with her until he's sure that he's the father.|In Touch Weekly Jan 10, 2008}} 

Wait a minute?  It is hard to believe that someone who is half baked on a diet of [[Jenkem|Starbucks]], cock and crack can speak in coherent sentences to a family friend.

'''Operation "Epic Cocktrap": FAIL'''

The chance is good that this was a cock trap by Jamie Lynn, to desperately prevent Casey from dumping her as all hick sluts try to do.  As always, this plan results in epic [[FAIL]].

She also seems to have a [[slut|belly button ring]]

==Getting married WTF?!?!?!==
It's now being reported [http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2008-03-26/] that the tramp is getting married to Casey, despite the fact that she's barely old enough to drive.  This shouldn't be too surprising, however, as rednecks from Louisiana often marry their brothers at the age of 12.  Expect a divorce when the baby turns out to be half-black person.

==Job Security==
Does this baby put her role in her Nickelodeon show [[shit nobody cares about|Zoey 101]] in jeopardy? [[jews|Representatives]] from the network had this to say:

{{Quote|We respect Jamie Lynn's decision to take responsibility in this sensitive and personal situation. We know this is a very difficult time for her and her family, and [[bullshit|our primary concern right now is for Jamie Lynn's well being]].|Nickelodeon Executives}} 

{{rainbowsmall|LOL FIRED BECAUSE SHE'S PREGGO}}

Despite the 4th - and final - season of Zoey 101, as well as the possibility of Jamie Lynn mostly written out of her own show.  Lynne Spears is already thinking about her daughter's future and has already accepted a $1M offer for the first photos of the new baby.  Jamie is going to need the money, as it is a good sign her career is pretty much finished when her starring title character is demoted to a guest star role. Just liker here wedding date, Zoey 101 is officially canceled due to FAIL and Nickelodeon has found a new cash-cow and role rodel with [[iCarly]]. Re-runs will be shown enough so Jamie can at least get residual royalty checks.

==An True Role Model==
With her celebrity role model status now severely compromised, Jamie Lynn tried for a desperate attempt to save her public image:

{{Quote|[[hypocrite|I definitely don't think it's something you should do; it's better to wait.]]|Jamie Lynn Spears}}

What Jamie didn't say, of course, is that she's really doing this in a desperate attempt to break her idiot mother's creepy stage-mom hold over her life.  If underage sex is what it takes to break out of that lunatic trailer-trash family, then go ahead and [[fuck|run]], Jamie. [[Fuck|Run]] while you still remember how to shower.

==Public Reaction==
For most girls, getting pregnant before you get your driver's license is a thing that causes much [[lulz|drama]] and [[poor|hardship]]. Of course, teen pregnancy doesn't actually matter if you're a rich celebrity with an even richer celebrity sister.  Money means you can get away with whatever the hell you [[OJ Simpson|want]], and it's not as if Jamie Lynn could be a worse parent than Britney unless she sold her babies for [[piss|Red Bull]]. Consequently, the [[media]] doesn't seem too worried about Jamie Lynn's future.

==Internets reaction==

==ZOMG SHE HAD THE BABY!!11!!!==
[[Image:LOLPREGGO.jpg|thumb|right|Keep smiling while you can, slut-- you sure as hell aren't gonna be smiling when yo' baby's daddy bails out on you.]]
On June 19th, 2008, Jamie Lynn popped out daughter Maddie Briann Aldridge somewhere in [[Mississippi]].  Here's to hoping the kid [[lulz|gives her absolute Hell]].  Since she had a daughter, if the kid follows in her slutty footsteps, Jamie Lynn can look to being a grandmother within 12 years - minimum.  And if she's lucky and has a granddaughter, then she can just wait another 12 years for a great grandchild.

Jamie Lynn has been commenting to magazines to quote her about how she's completely enjoying motherhood, but did not once mention getting paid $1 million for a few pictures of her baby[http://buzz.yahoo.com/buzzlog/91600/]. No, that's [[bullshit|perfectly normal]] to get paid that much money (which she doesn't even need) if she's [[lie|enjoying her motherhood]] for a few [[stupid|lovely]] pictures of her baby.

==Shotgun Wedding==
It has been reported that the date for the Jamie Lynn-Casey Aldridge wedding has been set for the autumn, as for the divorce that is still TBA.  Britney is planned to be the maid of honor, so we can expect much [[lulz]] at the wedding reception.  It is reported that there is going to be a ritual where the crotchspawn will be carried across the aisle in a basket of flowers.  This is to remind [[Anonymous|us]] that the only reason this wedding is happening because Jamie Lynn is a cock trapping [[slut]].

As for the wedding eats, we can expect the [[typical]] catering of fried chicken and meatballs, standard fare for ''every fucking reception''. With Britney there in her fragile mental state, we can expect this party to become a hoot when the family starts to partake in drinking the following traditional shotgun wedding beverages: 
*''Steel Reserve Malt Liquor,'' 
*''Cisco,'' 
*''Jager,'' 
*''MD 20/20,'' 
*''Thunderbird'', an Americunt classic.

As for the marriage, we can quote Dr. Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park 2: "First there are 'Oohs' and 'Ahhs', next there is running and screaming."

Due to Casey's wandering cock and Jamie's Lynn's stagnant career as of March 25th 2009 the Engagement has now been canceled. Which means the world is deprived of the lulz that would come from a messy divorce.

==The Other Woman==
In Touch Weekly has released a special report that Casey Aldridge was sleeping with 28 year old Kelli Dawson while Jamie was pregnant. OH JOY!

{{quote|The pair didn’t bother to hide their relationship.“ Kelli and Casey have been a couple on and off for a few years,” confirms Jason Alexander, Britney Spears’ first husband and a native of nearby Kentwood, LA. “They were a really tight couple, but I think it was hard for Kelli, having Jamie Lynn in the picture.”
Kelli says she and Casey stopped sleeping together a few months before Jamie Lynn gave birth to their daughter, Maddie. “It just didn’t feel right,” she explains. “He had to deal with the baby coming, and it had to stop.” She says the last time the couple had sex together was in March but “even after we stopped having sex, we would still kiss occasionally.”|InTouch}}

==ZOMG, SHE'S PREGNANT AGAIN!==
[[Last Thursday]], Jamie told a magazine that she's been knocked up [[Slut|AGAIN]] in [[fail|less than a year]]. At the time of publishing, [[Nobody|Casey Aldridge]] (Yes, the same baby daddy as before!) didn't know. Whether she decides to keep the baby again or be [[Falcon Punch]]ed in the womb remains TBA. Not even [[face palm]] can handle the amount of fail here. It's really that bad.
