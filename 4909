''Not to be confused with the gay [[Jonas Brothers]] series with the same name.''

'''Living The Dream''' is another [[chan|*chan]]-driven [[forced meme|expression]], used primarily to symbolize someone (or something) attaining an [[xbox|achievement or status]] millions of [[you|lonely anons]] [[trying too hard|strive]] for (usually [[failing]] in the process).

'''PROTIP:''' [[ED]] is always living the dream. [[You]] however [[never]] will.

==Usage==

Originally the name of a [[2006]] movie nobody even [[nobody cares|heard of]], the expression is now [[shooped|used]] with lots of screenshots from [[anime]] containing instances of [[epic win]] (usually involving [[backhand|slapping]] a [[bitch]] back to the [[kitchen]]), abridged into 3 or 4 panels with the last containing the protagonist [[beer|not giving a fuck]], and the phrase shooped below them. Alternate usage involves simply posting the phrase alongside the image containing said [[win]]. An abundance of accurate examples for this exist in the [[2007]]/[[2009]] [[anime]] Darker Than [[Black]], with the [[badass]] [[original character|protagonist]] slapping every [[female]] unit approaching him for assistance.
