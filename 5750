A wicked wildcard wittily wielded by wannabe walkabouts, '''nice try''' very commonly appears on the [[internet]], though in many different forms. This blanket exclamation covers all situations where a person doesn't want to appear gullible, and pre-emptively states something is [[bullshit|fake]] without actually looking at it too closely.

==Examples of Nice Try==
*"That is [[photoshop]]ped, [[This Looks Shopped|I can tell from the pixels]]. Nice try!"
*"[[Dax flame]] [[Duh|is an actor]][[oneoneone|!!!1]]"
*"That didn't happen, you're making it up! Still, nice try."
*"I bet you don't even have a [[essjay|degree]]. Nice try on [[Wikipedia]], though."
*"100 mph with that shitty car? black person please."
*"I know you don't [[deviantart|draw]] that well, you must've stolen that art somewhere."
...and on, and on. Since bullshit is the second most common thing on the web (need you ask which is the [[porn|first]]?), challenging said bullshit often turns out to be justified. This is why many [[basement dweller|netizens]] will play Nice Try on ''anything they see'', for fear of being ridiculed as gullible.

==Why it's retarded==
"We appreciate your contribution to the [[over 9000|12,000]] comments about this [[pix plz|photo]]. We have noted that you believe it to be photoshopped, and will take your opinion into account. Future generations will thank you, and steps are currently being taken to promote you to [[Jimbo Wales|Supreme Dictator of the World]] for your insight."
Enough said.

==Trolling Nice Try users==
These people can be found pretty much everywhere. Preferably target places with people in their late teens or early twenties: any younger and they might just believe anything you tell 'em, any older and they won't really give a shit.
#Find a pic (or anecdote) that's authentic, but ''might just'' look like it's [[shoop da whoop|shopped]] (or an [[Myth|Urban Legend]]). Or the other way round.
#Post!
#Enjoy the [[tl;dr|10-paragraph]] analyses of why the content is fake.
#Enjoy the 10-paragraph responses of why it's actually for real.
#Enjoy the ensuing [[flame war]], fueling it when appropriate.
#????
#PROFIT!

==Trolling by playing Nice Try==
This should be done in smallish communities, otherwise your comment will be drowned in a sea of [[4chan|internet junk]].
#Find content that was obviously intended as real. Bonus points if it actually is.
#Post a short comment basically saying "omg fake!" (keep it short, kids! remember, good [[trolling]] is minimal input for maximal result!)
#Enjoy the [[OP]]'s whining and 10-paragraph justification that it's actually for real.
#If it's a [[Mushroom Kingdom Fusion#Mushroom Kingdom Fusion Reactor|close-knit community]], enjoy the drama as other members express sympathy and support for their [[friend]]. Add comments every now and then.
