'''Buy A Dog''' is a [[meme]] that originated some time ago when [[Fox News|Faux News]] ran an [[bullshit|investigation]] on the growing threat of [[Anonymous|hackers on steroids]]. The propaganda flick relayed the horrifying tale of a [[basement dwelling]] [[incest|mama's boy]] named [[Alex Wuori]]. His MySpace had been [[rape|thoroughly hacked]] and covered with pictures of [[faggot|gay]] [[secks]], causing his [[otherkin|imaginary]] girlfriend to leave him. He also claimed that messages were left on his mom's answering machine threatening to slit his [[emo]] throat. He probably left them himself.

In typical over-the-top fashion, his [[concerned mother|mother]] immediately did what any reasonable person would do: she purchased a [[Brinks Home Security|new security system]] for her entire house, put a tracer on their phone line, closed the curtains, and finally...she [[Facepalm|'''BOUGHT A FUCKING DOG''']]. 

This may seem completely [[fucktard]]ed, but it is well known to [[Computer Science III|IT]] [[AOL|security experts]] that [[B|/b/]] is actually run by [[Caturday|cats]]  and that [[Longcat]] is the overlord of [[B|/b/]] and [[over 9,000]] times longer than [[mrfetch]].

==Hawt Tips==

[[Image:Stuckdog.jpg|thumb|left]]
[[Image:Stonerdog.jpg|right|thumb|[[weed|Stoner]]dog approves of this article.]]
* Dogs are the third hardest substance known to man, next to [[Dragonforce]], and, of course, [[My Chemical Romance]].
* Mathematical fact: '''Fear'''  +  '''Ignorance'''  +  '''[[series of tubes]]'''  +  '''[[????]]'''  =  <s>Siberian husky</s> '''[[PROFIT!| PROFIT!]]'''.
* Closing your curtains is the #1 way to protect yourself from [[Mike_Sandy|Anonymous Hackers]]. However, they may [[hack]] their way through your firewall-curtains.
* For [[Seven Proxies|optimum protection]], wrap said dog around curtains. 

It should be noted, however, that several very skilled hackers can bypass security machines through use of wire cutters and steroids.  Meanwhile many others are busy dissecting dogs and consulting with <strike>Michael Vick</strike> [[Ron Mexico]] in an [[Drugs|attempt to find creative ways]] around a dog. So far, all efforts have led to [[failure]].

If potential victims cannot buy a dog, then a [[:Image:Dog_curtains.jpg|Dog Curtain]] is fine too. A cat, however, [[rape|will actively work against you]].

'''NEWSBREAK:''' It has recently been confirmed that [[David Motari|dogs are weak against CLIFFS]].

'''JEWZ YOU CAN UZE:''' Some Anons carry chocolate with them due to the myth that it causes a [[Falcon Punch]] like effect on dog's hearts. It's baker's chocolate not the normal kind. Go find yourself a [[cake]]smith if there are no cliffs nearby.

==OMG THE DOG IS A LIE!!1==

[[Image:DogproofAnonymous.jpg|thumb|right|[[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY|Los Angeles]] 

The Dogproof Anon receives its first field test, and [http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4271465 ABC] is there with the cameras.]]

'''BREAKING NEWS FROM THE FRONTLINES:''' Working around the clock to meet the [[Project_Chanology_iRL_Raids_Latest_News|February 10th]] deadlines, /b/tard scientists have successfully created the prototype for the Dog-Proof Anon. No force in the universe can stop us now.  Except for fail caused by [[Pspunk666|newfags in Guy Fawkes masks]].

==Trivia==
*How did [[SlimVirgin]] defend herself against [[HACKERS ON STEROIDS|feared troll]], [[Blu Aardvark]]? She bought a dog; ironically, [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.lifestyle.furry/browse_thread/thread/8e2900498ed039b2/eaae4a6b96a72895?lnk=raot it was from Blu Aardvark].

*[[Gaia Online|The gaiafag developers]] banned [[Pedobear]] to make sure Anonymous doesn't come and slit their throats. They're going to buy fucking dogs!
*[[England|The dogs bollocks]] is slang in the [[UK]] for [[AWESOME]]
