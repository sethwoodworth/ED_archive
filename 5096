MacRumors

'''MacRumors''' is a shitty site for [[macfags]] to use for [[masturbating]] to [[Steve Jobs]] announcing [[Apple]] [[shit]]. Whenever someone with nothing better to do looks through [[Mac OS X]] source code and sees something that could possibly sort of indicate a new [[POS]] that macfags could spend a few thousand dollars on, or someone with a copy of [[Photoshop]] sends in a blurry pic of a mockup product, MacRumors reports it on their front page. If they know it's fake, they will either post in on their front page anyway [[for the lulz]] or put it on their "page 2" section [[MacBook Air|for no reason]].

The MacRumors forums are used by [[idiots]] who discuss their [[Scientology|need to dump their money]] up Jobs's ass by buying [[Shit nobody cares about|shiny crap with a picture of a fruit that lights up]] for [[over 9000]] dollars.

== The MacRumorsLive raid ==

The [[faggot]] admins of MacRumors forgot to put a password on the admin panel of their live feed from the last MacWorld which [[Steve Jobs]] attended, so some [[g|/g/urus]] decided to [[raid]] it, causing [[butthurt]] from macfags in the forums. Tip for the admins: yes, your Macs are secure, but not if you don't put a fucking [[password]] on your admin panel, you [[fucktard]] [[newfags]]. Not that we really give a shit, though, as [[lulz]] ensued and [[Anonymous]], along with [[4chan]], got onto news websites and newspapers, humiliating the [[stupid]] admins of MacRumors and the staff of [[Apple]].
