'''The LURKMORE wiki''' is a site dedicated to the documentation of the [[lulz]] and [[meme]]s that appear on the [[internets]]. Sound [[encyclopediadramatica|familiar]]? No? [[Wikichan|Nothing]]? Well, all right then. On the surface, they appear to be simple folk, just trying to make a living by doing what someone else is already doing, only doing it much worse, which brings one to ask: Can you really hate them for living the [[americunt|American]] Dream?
