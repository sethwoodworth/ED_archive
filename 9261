'''Yoko Beaumont''', AKA '''Billy Horton''', '''Indigo-Nightfall''', '''colleen_kiyoneko''', amongst others, is a 25 year old [[furry]] who spends most of his time online impersonating artists and random furries he finds on [[Furaffinity]], [[DeviantArt]], [[Steam]], [[Furcadia]], [[IMVU]], and [[Second Life]], just to name a few.  He also has a habit of [[Mega Man|taking the identities of people]] who either call him out or don't go along with his whims, and has even taken the identity of the [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/2835733/454857293/ dead].  He then uses their identities to stalk and harass other users and generally makes them out to be [[aspergers|bat shit insane]] while the real identity holders are generally oblivious to his antics. [[Serious_business|Yes we're serious.]]


== Examples of Yoko Beaumont's insanity ==
When Yoko initiates contact with someone, it is usually under the guise that he has caught someone else, usually an alt or [[lies|“distant relative”]] of his, using their art and/or posting it under their name or he will claim to be someone else who has caught him (Yoko) impersonating them. He will often make up false personas on various websites and interact with them, all with the same insane and controlling mentality that he has. His list of aliases and identities on [[Second Life]] alone is, literally, [[over 9000]]. [[TL;DR|These include such names as:

He also [http://pastebin.ca/1720314 once tried to charge one person $30] (reduced to $15 because he is so [[lie|nice]]) to participate in his cybersex role play universe, on top of being updated as to her where abouts every hour of the day under the threat of being banned from his site. The [[stupid|absurd]] rules go on and on.

He has also tried to silence the furries on [[FurAffinity]]; many have made journals warning other potential victims about this bat shit crazy fucker and his equally insane behaviour. [[butthurt|He doesn't take too kindly to this, and as such has contacted FA admins to remove any journal made about him on the grounds of harassment]] to try and hide his behaviour even more.

== Impersonation? On my internets? ==
One of Yoko's more infamous activities which he engages in, is the impersonation of artists based on the information that is publicly available, including [[art theft|art in most cases]], to try and defame the person in question, piss them off, or fulfill some [[retard|desire that he has to be someone else]].

== Uh oh he did it again ==
Yoko was recently caught scamming users out of real money on the [[Secondlife]] HUD "Tintagel Empire" which assumingly is a role play universe. For the full scoop visit their [http://tintagelempire.weebly.com/alerts.html website] which includes more of his Second life alternates, and the list seems to be updated. We can only hope someone will report him to the police.
