Shortcat is [[some argue|regarded by many]] as the mortal enemy of [[Longcat]], being that Longcat is loooooooooooong, and Shortcat is short.  But that's [[retarded|bullshit]]. It's [[Some argue|argued]] that he's the brother of [[Tactrohs]]. It is also argued that Shortcat is a [[photomanip]] of Longcat. This, of course, is a [[lie]] designed to stop the spread of Shortcat, as shrt was clearly the original and its loooonger [[incest|cousin]] was the [[photoshop|shooped]] one. Also blood-related to Shatcat. [[Some argue|Some say]] shortcat is the brother of [[longcat]]. This is [[Some argue |unconfirmed]].
