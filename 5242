Mavica Sprite

Very early in the morning on Tuesday, May 20th, 2008, a [[/b/tard]] posted another lame, "Hey, /b/ what do
you think of this chick?" thread. Another [[/b/tard]] noticed the crappy Sony Mavica digital camera in the [[OP]]'s picture, mocking the [[OP]] because the Sony Mavica used 3.5 inch [[floppy disk]]s for storage. At this point, shit went off and all [[/b/tard]]s started talking about how they wanted to fuck the camera. A pic of a Sony Mavica next to a sprite can was then posted, and everyone started requesting [[rule 34]] on Sprite and the Mavica. No one could deliver for a while and all the [[/b/tard]]s started getting pissed, until one came along and drew an [[MS Paint]] [[penis]] on the Sprite can and thought they were the shit for doing so. Then, a picture of a generic war machine was posted and shortly after someone [[photoshopped]] a Sony Mavica Sprite War Machine. Lots of [[motivational poster]]s were made. The thread got archived and the crowd went wild.

The thread survived for nine hours. Thus was created the Mavica/Sprite meme.
