Kitty Krew
[[Image:Big_Fuzzy_Kitten.jpeg|thumb|Big Fuzzy Kitten]]
The '''Kitty Krew''' is a group of Flash [[trolls]] who take pride in mocking the avarage [[Newgrounds]] user. The group was formed by BigFuzzyKitten, [[Sweden|Lasse]] and [[pokemon|seel]] on July 17, 2006 and has since been a clusterfuck of power struggles and dick jokes.

=History=
The [[KKK|KK]] was born from [[newgrounds|NGcollabs]] a [[Shit nobody cares about|website dedicated to making flash collaborations for Newgrounds.com]] when 3 users decided to [[gay|have]] [[orgy|fun]] and put little effort into making a collab, it was about [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/325602 cats having sex.]. Shortly after, the collab members decided to start up a spam crew based on the "success" of the flash, and membership quickly grew.

==2006==
The Kitty Krew begain it's relentless assault upon Newgrounds, bringing upon much lulz in the form of hate reviews
==2007==
Many people would say this was the best year for the Kitty Krew. Newgrounds was still very populated at this point, as there had not been a mass exodus to [[youtube]] yet. With several thousand views for each flash submitted, the Kitty Krew agenda was well filled. Many amazingly stupid reviews were sent in from the fed up Newgrounds users, which is exactly what the crew wanted. The Kitty Krew was also able to nab four consecutive Turd Of The Week awards, instantly bringing jealousy to other groups such as the Star Syndicate.

==2008==
Attempts to destroy [[KKK|KK]] were made by noobs, but it was total failure.
==2009==
Early in the year, there was no Kitty Krew, as all of its members had disbanded, however several members were able to round up many of its previous members to attempt a revival. Not much flash was done at all this year, which could be seen as the most productive thing that has ever happened to the group.
==2010==
The crew made a major comeback, matching their previous record of four consecutive Turd Of The Week awards. In all, the crew received five Underdog awards and nine Turd Of The Week awards. Late in the year however, members remembered once again that there really was no point to newgrounds and activity in the portal slowed down. One of [[WadeFulp|Wade Fulp's]] temper tantrums may have been a large contributer to this, as he deleated many flashes in his attempt to distract him from the pain of his genital discharge.

=Flash=
Kitty Krew flashes are renown for being absolutely [[shit|horrible]]. Sometimes the submission is just to [[Offended|offend]] its viewers and cause them to [[Crybaby|baww]] about the flash's lack of [[lie|promised]] hentai, while other submissions are just [[Shit nobody cares about|mindless ideas that never went anywhere]]

There are numerous ways to make a Kitty Krew flash, all of which employ no effort whatsoever.

One of the main points to a Kitty Krew flash is the [[fail|lulzy]] reviews by [[noobs|Newgrounds' members.]]
