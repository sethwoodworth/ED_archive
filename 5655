Nathaniel Nurnberg
'''Nathaniel Nurnberg''' a [[jew]], is a jet pilot who lives at 14672 S. 52nd East Avenue in Bixby, [[Oklahoma]]. He probably has a lot of time on his hands these days - [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=14672+S+52ND+EAST+AVE+bixby+ok&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=39.320439,85.078125&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=16&om=1 stop by for a chat sometime!]

On a cold, lonely January 12, 2007, Nate was spending the night in a hotel in Westchester, [[New York]] on a layover. It was a perfect time to start downloading some hot man-on-boy [[child porn]] through the hotel's free WiFi so he could do some serious [[fap]]ping to help him get to sleep. After all, getting up at 0500 or some god-awful time to head to the nearby [http://www.whiteplainsairport.com/ White Plains Airport] and start the long flight to his next destination was gonna be rough.

Seems that Nate preferred to download and store his CP in [[Limewire]]. All the better to rub one out to some hot [[babyfuck]]ing while listening to [[Tatu]]'s Greatest Hits.

Some flight attendants staying next door who were using iTunes saw Nathaniel's shared Limewire folder pop up. Curious, one of them looked inside it and...

... he discovered Nate's CP and called the cops! 

Just as Nate was about to [[cum]] to the awesome movie he had just DL'd showing a 4-year-old being buggered, the [[IRL]] police broke down his door and hauled him off in cuffs.

Now Nate is charged with the ominously-named "Possession of an Obscene Sexual Performance by a Child," something that could land him in [[jail]] for up to four years of [[surprise buttsecks]].
