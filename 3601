'''Hamtaro's Theory''' (also '''Hamtaro's Most Excellent Theory of the Inevitable [[Gay]]ification of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]])''' is an adage that [[Hamtaro]] thought of as soon as he discovered the existence of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] which states thusly: 

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">Within six months of its inception, [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] will become a cesspool of [[over 9,000|bad]] [[at least 100|jokes]] and personal attacks rivaling [[Urban Dictionary]] in its b[[anal]]ity.</blockquote>

Hamtaro's prophecy came true with the [[Ratherberucking]] feud in May 2005. Ask someone who was around then and maybe after a few shots they will tell you the horrors that proceeded from such a dark and disgusting time. Oh, the [[Goatse|HORROR! THE HORROR!]]
