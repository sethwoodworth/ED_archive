Troy King
==The Story==
[[Image:Troyking1.jpg|thumb|300px|This dude hates fags, while being a fag.]]
Possibly [[gay]], Republican Attorney General of the State of Alabama, whose homophobia renders him a caricature of hypocritical Republicanism.

Here's the text from Wonkette:

<blockquote>This may come as a shock, but a prominent anti-homosexual Republican attorney general has apparently been caught having homosexual sex intercourse with his homosexual gay male assistant. Bonus: The dude’s wife caught him, in their bed. This is the rumor that the AG’s office has officially denied, so now of course everybody is spilling the sordid details.

AG in question is Troy King, who, of course, is only interested in outlawing homosexuality and sex toys. His gay lover is either a college “buddy,” or a very young youngster and “Homecoming King” from Troy University. What are the odds of a dude named Troy King getting caught in bed with a Homecoming King from Troy University? This seems like a wacky sitcom plot, on a gay porn channel. (Is this what that Will & Grace was about?) <br><br><i>Text taken from http://wonkette.com/tag/troy-king</i>.</blockquote>

Troy King was allegedly discovered by his wife as he fucked another man or was fucked by another man in the ass.  His personal information should be found, and more information should be sought.

==Troy King's Letters to the Crimson White==

Troy King wrote letters to <i>The Crimson White</i>, the student newspaper of the University of Alabama when he was a student there in the early 1990s.  They're hilarious, but unfortunately they've disappeared from the searchable archive on the website of <i>The Crimson White</i>.  Anyway, here they are:

===First Letter===
Feb. 21, 1992

The time has come for the majority to rise from its figurative slumber. The picture on the front page of Monday's issue of The Crimson White looked like the front page of Sodom and Gomorrah News the day before those cities were destroyed. I and a majority of the students were appalled not that these students would pose for this picture, for we have seen that the homosexuals in America will do anything to grab a headline but rather I am furious that this paper would sacrifice its journalistic integrity for a tabloid-esque reporting! It is indeed sad that America has fallen to the point where she will condone any type of deviant, immoral activity in which a group desires to participate. However, perhaps even more compelling evidence of the perversion of America is evidenced not only by the [[fact]] that this story was published in the newspaper but rather that it was graphically depicted on the front page.

The existence of the Gay/Lesbian alliance on this campus is an affront to the state of Alabama, its citizenry, this diversity and its students. However, it is also an outrage to compel those students with both moral and religious objections to the activities and ideas espoused by this organization to contribute money, via student fees, to subsidize these activities.

One has but to look at the forces which the controversy has united--from the American Civil Liberties Union to the National Organization of [[Women]] to the Queer Nation just to name a few--to clearly see how corrupt a cause this truly is.

The argument can often be heard that what goes on in the bedroom is private. However, it is flawed reasoning to attempt to justify the gay movement in America today on this basis, for they have taken sex from the confines of the bedroom into the streets, the evening news, and now even the front page of the newspaper.

Am I to be condemned and labeled a homophobic [sic] for this stance? I think not. However, if this is the penalty for taking a firm stand against those practices, which are condemned in the Bible and prohibited in Alabama statutes, then it is a price I am willing to pay. I am unwilling to stand by as an entire generation of Americans grow up amidst the turmoil that has followed the mass exodus of the homosexuals from the closet.

I take issue with the accusation being hurled about that the SGA was not representing the entire student body when it passed resolution #32. A letter in that same Monday edition of The CW stated that there are 2,000 gays on campus.

While this seems to be a desperate exaggeration of the truth, even if one accepts this figure, that still leaves almost 16,000 students who are not gay. If my math is correct, and this is still a democracy, the SGA could represent the majority of students and still have voted overwhelmingly for this amendment.

That's enough said about this, now let's all go to the Cracker Barrel for lunch.

March 12, 1992

I have read amusedly over the past few days and weeks as one homosexual after another has attempted to justify their deviant behavior as normal. The folks at Seen and Heard and the Gay/Lesbian Alliance are indeed getting desperate. This crystallized in The Crimson White letter column when Steve Barker, a man who fantasizes about Denny Chimes, took his sarcastic pen in hand and set out to cloud the issue. Equally illustrative of the point was the dispatch of a hatchet person from the English department's faculty lounge to make cheap attacks on one of the student's who requested the Attorney General's opinion. The faculty are out of place when they begin assaulting the character of the students, especially when they cowardly do it in the newspaper of an out-of-state college. If it were true that the gay lifestyle has been accepted in mainstream America then surely there would not be such widespread disgust at their actions. In fact, the only people I see applauding their deplorable actions are other homosexuals. If homosexuals on this campus are not ashamed of their lifestyle, then I challenge any of you to step out from behind the cowardice of the written word. The gauntlet, or should I say the lace glove, is now laying on the ground, ready to be picked up by any of you who are willing to discuss this topic over the airwaves of Tuscaloosa. I have already been contacted by at least one talk show host on WVUA radio, who has offered to provide a forum for this discussion; and with only a spit guard between us, I will gladly go on the radio and debate this issue. Anyone interested in accepting this challenge may contact me at The Crimson White.

However, perhaps if the male homosexuals were more comfortable with their femininity and females were secure in their masculinity, then this campus and this state would not now be embroiled in this controversy. You may call me a homophobe or you can call me a bigot, but the fact still remains that the majority of America still calls me right.

If it is true that the majority of Americans support this cause, as has been alleged, then why has the Cracker Barrel's stock soured to unprecedented highs since this hiring policy was implemented? The answer is simple. Americans have rejected this lifestyle as perverted and are voicing their disapproval by flooding the dining rooms of the Cracker Barrel. I happen to agree with this policy for public health and safety reasons and am glad that my patronage is helping to perpetuate this policy. While it is true that there is no evidence which positively proves that one can contract [[AIDS]] from food servers, it is just as true that there was no evidence that one could get AIDS from medical personnel or blood transfusions or from sex until it happened.

I often hear the argument that homosexuals who live together create a loving, caring family environment, perhaps an environment which is even superior to that which can be provided by a heterosexual couple. In this day of rampant decadence, many homosexuals would mislead society into believing that three men, an armadillo and a houseplant create a functional family. This is clearly flawed reasoning, which will wilt under scrutiny and should be dismissed as such.

The student government association on campuses around this state, the Alabama Legislature, Gov. Guy Hunt and Attorney General Jimmy Evans, who is no doubt about to add his support to this list, have joined in one voice to condemn these activities and uphold the Alabama sodomy laws. This is now the undisputed law in Alabama and since the United States Supreme Court has upheld similar laws in Georgia, it seems certain that Alabama's laws will receive a similar reception from the nation's high court.

Let me suggest to those who are displeased by these laws that there are a number of interstates which lead out of Alabama and into areas of our nation which are less hostile to their perversions. Those who are displeased with these laws, which reflect the view of the majority of Alabama, are invited to make the maximum use of their tax dollars to the highway department and follow these roads into areas where these views are accepted and their actions legal.

I have no intention nor will I respond to this debate again. This war of words has raged violently and gallons of ink have already been used over it. It has been apparent from many of the writers' letters that the first casualty of this battle was common sense. Both sides have batted the rhetoric back and forth but it seems to me that in the final analysis, the homosexuals can make fun of and mock those who have verbalized their opposition to their deviance but that will not change the fact that they are still breaking the laws of Alabama as well as God.

Liberals' views are inconsistent

Editor,

I sit in befuddled amazement at what the liberals will say and do next. It is indeed funny how often their actions belie their words. The latest collection of contradictions was splashed across your paper's editorial page on Friday, September 3.

Brenna Ryan, a graduate student in the Arts and Sciences was the bearer of the left's latest idiocy. Let me just begin by answering what I am sure was meant as rhetorical question. Miss Ryan, homosexuality "Homosexuality began expediting death when AIDS became rampant among the homosexual population of this country.

Currently, AIDS is the most behavior-oriented [[disease]] known to mankind. If this nation's current purveyors of perversion would refrain from committing sodomy they would unquestioningly be spared the ravages of the disease.

To argue that Jesus Christ condones these acts is ludicrous and hardly even deserves a response. Perhaps, Jesus never addressed the issue of homosexuality because the horror of Sodom and Gomorrah still echoed across the ages like the deep rumble of judgment.

To the liberal mind, there can be nothing more horrifying than the thought that there are moral rights and moral wrongs. And yet, their displeasure doesn't change anything. Rather, these laws are etched upon the tablets of time and reach across the years to tap us on the shoulders even today. It is curious to note the discrepancies in what our friends say. It is ironic that liberals rip their hair and rend their clothing to battle harms in obscure corners of the globe but care not for the slaughter taking place at home. They have committed troops to halt ethnic cleansing in Bosnia but they will not even commit to restraints that would slow the terrible 'cleansing' of the wombs that is carried on in the butcher shops we call abortion clinics. They willingly send American soldiers to die in battles of intervention in faraway lands but they refuse to restrain their own sexual urges to prevent the spattering of infants' blood on the cold walls of an abortion clinic.

And for those who might accept that some liberals actually do advocate exploration of ideas through an open mind--a mind often so open that it seems that their brains have fallen out--we have but to only recall that they have recently dusted off the old, yellowed parchment of the Fairness Doctrine. Armed with that weapon of ideas, they plan to silence their critics.

Is this an encouragement to examine every political issue that has lead (sic) the political issue as both multi-faceted and resplendent with fluid continuums of ideology?

If that were the goal, then such a display of one side of an issue as that appearing in the library should be a welcome conduit for a free exchange of ideas. If that were our test, then Brenna Ryan would receive an F.
