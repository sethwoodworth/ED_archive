Bash
'''Bash''' can have three meanings.

==Bash [[IRL]]==
Bash -ing: To smack the living [[shit]] out of a [[n00b]]. This can be accomplished either with one's hands and feet, or the bash<i>er</i> may elect to use tools such as a two-by-four, a baseball bat, knuckledusters, or in extreme cases a morningstar. Being bashed is a form of being [[pwned]] [[IRL]]. [[Internet tough guy]]s often threaten to bash people. [[Image: Baseballbat.jpg|thumb|One popular method of [[bash]]ing.]] [[Image:Morningstar.jpg|thumb|Favorite tool of hardcore bashers.]]

If yo diss tha niggaz, yo will get yo skinny white ass bashed. Yo have been warned, brotha.

==Bash Online==
A mostly lame website dedicated to hosting quotes from IRC, all of which are totally fake. Unlike bashing IRL, OL bash is totally lulz-free.
See [[Bash.org]]

==GNU Bourne Again Shell==
bash is a shitty replacement for the Bourne shell (command interpreter) that also [[fail|fails]] at incorporating many other features from other actually useful shells (like tcsh). Most bash implementation on [[Lunix]] chopperating systems have a whopping two (2) aliases set by default, no key binding for backward-delete-word, and no key binding for ^D. [[You]], bright user, then realize why it's called "bash"... because it makes you want to bash your skull into the fucking desk. bash is unsuitable to have as a default shell for the superuser (root) and the next release will most likely allow your system users or daemons to drop right into root.
