'''Beg, borrow or steal a Bitchiekittie NOW!'''

I wanted to take the time to wish everyone a passionate Flirt With Bitchiekittie Day.
I hope that everyone will sincerely participate in the true spirit of Flirt With Bitchiekittie Day by joining the tragic struggle of Bitchiekittie-flirters throughout the world.

Please try to get to work at riding your own Bitchiekittie, but if you don't have a Bitchiekittie then someone else's Bitchiekittie will do.

While this site and others like it may ''at times'' be something that would offend your Bitchiekittie, make her shake her finger and mutter Bitchiekittiely disapproving things, it is important that we remember that there are real people behind the drama who are still intimately in touch with their Bitchiekitties.

A lonely Flirt With Bitchiekittie Day is conducive to writing increasingly desperate, unrequited, sexual and [[emo]] rants. Many people will seek to alleviate that by responding in your [[blog]] with phrases such as "I want to smell Bitchiekittie's jeans!" If you find yourself the target of such behaviour and it becomes a stressful factor in your life, please consider joining in the fun by organizing a tour and re-inflating your Bitchiekittie.

Trust me, you're not going to lose any credibility if you aren't here, hawkishly watching for the next reply to your edit or comment. 

Drink some electrolyte-replacing fluid and ''flirt 'til it hurts!'' 

All the same stuff will still be here after you return from flirting. The Internet will never be lacking in new drama, fabricated or otherwise.

So, enjoy your life, but treat your Bitchiekittie with great care and respect. Experiment with candlelighting, reciting romantic speeches and poems, and singing.
