The chubby 14 year old was exposed on the same day as the [[Asa Coon|SuccessTech]] shooting. His attempt to recruit another boy backfired when the boy snitched him out. [[You are both suspended|They were both suspended]]. Afterward, said snitch was rewarded greatly by the president and media for his honesty. Much lulz were had when aforementioned snitch and friends attempted to rob Dillon's house while he was in jail. President was butthurt. Film at 11.
