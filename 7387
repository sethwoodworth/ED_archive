{{quote|Due to recent [[article|attacks]] against this site, some of its [[mod|staff members]], and [[faggot|myself]], I have made the decision to [[suicide|close down this site]].

It is an unfortunate matter, but I [[butthurt|cannot maintain this site at this time]].

In the end, I hope [[noone|you]] enjoyed the site and [[unrealistic expectations|made some friends]]. You don't have to [[an hero|kill ties]] with them.|Robert|forever your superior}}

Seto-Kaiba.com was a [[circle jerk]] fansite made by a [[fat]], bumptious, fanatic New Yorker ([[Powerword]]: '''Robert Tracey''') who thought he could impersonate his [[yaoi|favorite]] [[anime]] [[asshole]] on TV better than anyone else, and what better way to fully accomplish that online than [[ban]] the fuck out of everything that dared move around you?

A simple coincidence involving two [[lonely|banned]] members meeting through this very page sparked a short lived attempt at writing a fake attack article so shitty, weak and tasteless, nobody would've foreseen the amount of butthurt it would eventually cause. After posting some [[nobody cares|important]] and [[bullshit|revealing]] information about how much space the [[fatass]] owner of the site took up from [[New York]], the voluminous amounts of constipating shit he withheld within him upon reading this page exploded his rectum so powerfully, the force was sufficient to take out the entire site, all of its [[furries|suicidal members]] and a significant portion of his beloved city. [[Jews did wtc]] DID sound better, but this is the sad [[truth]]. 
Without further ado, and in the words of the man himself, <i>it's time to promote this site so you won't have to visit it</i>. And in this particular case, ever again.

[[File:Robert_tracey.jpg|thumb|left|The man himself. Can you feel the [[faggotry|power]] this [[lolcow|living god]] wields?]]
[[File:S-k.com-facebookreview.jpg|thumb|right|Even [[facebook]] users recognize his unending faggotry.]]

It wasn't too long before seto-kaiba.com's self-proclaimed admin and owner 'Robert' made the tiny little mistake of, whoops, kicking everybody out that didn't suck up enough within their first five seconds as members came and bit him in the ass in the form of this article, formerly a pathetic, useless and [[unfunny]] stub that most likely made the site junkies feel even more confident about themselves.

Naturally, the amount of shit flinging and vandalizing involved grew a lot more after Robert miraculously [[buttsecks|noticed]] somebody outside his [[hugbox]] was actually criticizing him and his staff for [[BAW|banning]] the baddies who touched them inappropriately. Like that wouldn't drive bored fucktards to try and retaliate somehow.

Fortunately for everyone, Robert could never handle the taste of his own [[shit|medicine]] when put on the receiving end of the [[anus|tailpipe]], proving once and for all just how much the site [[lie|was devoted to his beloved members]] and had nothing to do with his own [[USI|amusement]]. Much [[lulz|entertainment]] followed after their deciding to [[lol|take matters into their own hands]], and the following is a detailed step-by-step tutorial they [[vandal|helped create]] on how to build the perfect YGO deck to [[queening|mind crush]] all your online opponents and redeem yourself as the undisputed King of Games.

==Forums==
{{quote|None, no costs to register or use the site. However, those that intentionally [[spam]] the forum with a mass amount of messages, or other parts of the site and cause [[buttsecks|bandwith problems]] may be held [[lolsuit|liable]] for [[bawww|bandwith fees]].|Robert|on membership costs [http://web.archive.org/web/20071210124223/http://www.seto-kaiba.com/help.php&#63;sessionid&#61;0#lnk1 ]}}
The so-called [[l33t|custom-coded]] forums started off as an [[fag|obnoxious newfag's]] attempt at coding a shitty little box that can save your [[shit|useful contributions]] for his own amusement. Due to the [[cock|massive]] coincidence involved in the domain name, lots of depraved newfags, having no sense of dignity (or their own penis) decided they were better off sucking on Robert's little wad for a living.

[[File:Seto-kaiba.com-politeness.jpg|thumb|right|Witness the extreme professionalism, as Robert delivers cutting-edge error reporting.]]

In order to join, you had to first and foremost

The forums section was for five years concealed in order to hide all the [[bullshit|intelligent discussions]] going on at the time, mostly about [[ass|asses]] he liked to stare at. Without prior warning to the [[gay|poor]] [[furries|souls]] relying on this form of secrecy to protect them from the [[Anonymous|outside world]], Robert up and went made his forums [[OH SHI-|public]], mainly due to his [[diarrhea|incessant urge]] to inform the world of his [[fail|success story]]. Naturally, when you're an idiot who goes so far just to gain the approval of people who'll never give a shit about you, you own the most [[trolls|vulnerable and exposed ass on the entire planet]]. Only then could your [[nobody cares|widespread reputation]] protect you.

==Prominent and Respectable Members==
Most members on the site amounted to shit to the supposed "[[mods|staff]]", yet were still dog-trained to serve their masters in [[oral|several ways]]. Their most recent tactics to [[taking down ED|bring down]] this article involved:

* pretending their [[Skateboard-City|petty little in-drama]] could [[SNCA|possibly mean anything to anyone]], and that [[usi|this is what the article should truly document]]
* claiming the site is still up, when clearly they've [[self-pwn|self-banned]] themselves from any possible region on the [[interwebs]] to avoid any new [[anal|exposure]]
* [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Seto-Kaiba.com&diff=next&oldid=1998463389 linking] to [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Seto-Kaiba.com&diff=1998462375&oldid=1998462329 innocent facebooks] to possibly drag unrelated people (hilariously, the people they'd point to are much better looking than anything Robert could dream of becoming)
* blanking this page [[ED:VIP|over and over]]
* pretending they can [[hardcore|handle]] the heat, or are [[bored]] (strangely enough they keep coming here to [[vandalizing|do something new]] every other day)
* attacking other websites via [[Talk:Seto-Kaiba.com|talk pages]], and blaming it on this article

...the list goes on, and below are the [[fucktards|masterminds]] behind the [[cancer]] itself.

===Robert aka 'Seto Kaiba'===
{{aspergers}}
[[File:Head up your ass.jpg|thumb|right|Obtaining Robert's [[IRL]] photo proved difficult.]]

On his site, Robert likes to pretend that people are [[trying too hard|blindly striving]] to know him better for reasons unbeknownst to him, remaining ignorant of the [[Lie|truth]] behind his undisputed [[faggotry|greatness and superiority]]. This is of course a lie, as everybody just sucks up to him out of habit, lack of goal and self-esteem. Any person that isn't a complete [[retard]] would not accept this for themselves, but he has always shown the world how he's not prepared to accept sane people on his site to begin with, and WILL [[ban]] you for the slightest sign of rebellion you exhibit in his presence; even [[Kimmo Alm]] would shed a tear in support.

{{quote|[02:17] <Kis> we've been trying to deal with it outside of you guys
<br>
[02:17] <Kis> But Vinland hides behind ED and wont face any of us.|Because sending three virgin girls to do ALL your bidding, get bent and raped all over the internet in your stead is the manliest thing to do.}}



When dealing with him, you will inevitably notice he will always go out of his way to show you he's [[Serious fucking business|a very busy person]], has no time for [[you]], knows everything about the world ([[you]] included) and, no matter what happens, he will [[USI|ALWAYS strive not to be the last person posting in a thread on his shitty site]], even if it means logging into an [[sock|alt]] and [[retard|replying to himself]]. 
Considering his [[pussy|balls of steel]], he has opted never to show his face on ED, despite the fact his shills have constantly informed him about how [[raep|well]] they were [[buttsecks|treated]]. Of course, when you recruit an [[harem|entire staff]] full of attention whoring [[tubgirl|tubgirls]] who think they amount to anything just because they have the visual capacity to legally prove your microscopic [[penis]] actually exists, your awakening would be far beyond just abrupt.

====Data====
[[File:Aeeverywhere.jpg|thumb|right|But fortunately he loves [[teh]] [[ED]].]]
[[File:Epic_reaction.jpg|thumb|left|Upon finding this page.]]
The following is the [[shit nobody cares about|highly sensitive information]] that irreversibly sent an entire site with all its [[tl;dr|rich history]] spanning over [[100 years ago|half a decade]] into total [[an hero|oblivion]]. You can see for yourself how several parties on his site can potentially become affected by this horrific breach of their privacy and security, completely justifying the site's shutdown for their safety:
* used to live in Albany (continued living there until 2008)
* most probably suffering a highly severe case of [[assburgers]] syndrome accompanying his [[unwarranted self-importance]]
* his [[shit|server]] moved to GoDaddy now, server presumed to be in [[Canada]] ([[lolwut]])
* he supposedly went to [[college|SUNY]] before [[fail|ragequitting and finding an even shittier uni to apply for]]
* listed his dox in full just to apply to a [[WoW]] [[guild]]
* presumed to be born in [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qm5a4iqjXb4J:loti-guild.com/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1201.0+solyobscura 1984]
* talks 24/7 about being a [[pussy|wannabe]] accountant [[USI|working]] for [[serious business|'big' companies]], and will [[truth|definitely]] go out of his way just to mention this to [[you]]
* And since he cried so much to have it taken down, his IP: 74.66.28.209
* it was believed by the original authors that he is catching all kinds of hell from [[ED]]. When [[AE-tan]] was queried for comment, she had this to say:
{{quote|Who?|[[AE-tan]]}}
Naturally, a [[faggot|person]] who spends over 6 years believing he means to the world a lot more than the next fuck online with a hopeless case of [[USI]] would also find the above very [[serious business|threatening]], because the information is so sufficient, accurate and clear to [[noone|lots and lots of people]] trying to find and [[raep|kill]] the guy, apparently.
If you would like to contact this individual to offer <strike>your condolences for having to deal with</strike> congratulations for turning such a brainless, worthless, uninspired, boring as shit attack at him into a successful troll, when he could've just went to fucking bed and waited it out instead, feel free:

Amazingly, still no one gives a remote shit about nonexistant drama where nobody got maimed, died, or became [[an hero]] to us all. It is truly amazing what the most diligent of [[script kiddies]] can accomplish when their panties are wadded tight in a knot. Hacking (and I use that term REAL fucking loosely) into a no-name forum and compromsing the accounts of people the author claimed do not visit the site anymore is truly an [[epic win]]. Keep on fighting the good fight.

[[raep|Robert's girlfriend]] 'Shana' (more notoriously known as 'QueenSarcasm' just about fucking [[obvious|everywhere]]) is Robert's token [[bitch]]. She tries to mimic him in everything he does (failing the most when it comes to [[english|talking]]) and will just as well [[trying too hard|go out of her way]] to show you how too [[important]] she is to bother with you. She also likes having [[youtube]] [[fans]], but never speaks with them (unless they show her her place) and probably has [[over 9000]] subscriptions to other people there, but loves to hide it on her channel.

'''UPDATE:''' Broke up with him out of [[pussy|fear]].

(00:38:16) Adam: The fact of the matter is
(00:38:30) Adam: Rob uses inexpensive hosting because he isn't rich
(00:38:34) Adam: Which is smart w/e

(00:39:01) Adam: for an obscure e-"crime"

(00:39:15) Jaclyn: ^_-
(00:39:21) Adam: Pedophilia is a well-know crime
(00:39:30) Adam: which have groups that seek these people.
(00:39:35) Jaclyn: But yeah.
(00:39:39) Adam: Bandwidth usage 'aint

(00:40:29) Jaclyn: no correction.
(00:40:30) Adam: So only an idiot would file a claim.

(00:40:40) Adam: Waste of money.
(00:41:03) Jaclyn: Whatever you say buddy.'
(00:42:32) Adam: You could always claim he's a pedo, lol.
(00:42:39) Adam: A bandwidth pedo.

(00:28:41) Adam:  Is Rob gonna try to sue :p?
(00:28:48) Adam: or something...?
(00:28:57) Adam: I feel like he'd want som serious revenge.
(00:28:59) Adam: some*
(00:29:04) Jaclyn: That's up to Rob.
(00:29:13) Adam: You can't sue for that.
(00:29:24) Jaclyn: Oh, there's a lot of things you can sue for.
(00:29:30) Jaclyn: But personally financial gain wouldn't be the idea.
(00:29:41) Adam: Not over the internet?
(00:29:48) Adam: What law would this be breaking?
(00:29:57) Jaclyn: o.o
(00:30:01) Jaclyn: the things I have seen people sue for.
(00:30:32) Adam: Yeah
(00:30:34) Adam: Try and fail.
(00:31:02) Jaclyn: I'm not going to explain it to you, cause plz I know you talk to your little friend through ED.
(00:31:03) Adam: Plus the idea of filing a lawsuit against an ip is redonkulous.
(00:31:20) Adam: Uh, everything I've ever said to him
(00:31:25) Adam: is on his ed page
(00:31:30) Jaclyn: Dude. I don't trust you.
(00:31:31) Jaclyn: You know that.
(00:31:33) Adam: we don't talk outside of ed.
(00:31:37) Adam: Fair.
(00:31:41) Jaclyn: and ED has an IRC server
(00:31:42) Adam: But that's the truth.
(00:31:48) Jaclyn: so still within "ED"
(00:31:48) Adam: He's never on.
(00:32:06) Adam: Aejae comes on
(00:32:09) Adam: you can ask her
(00:32:14) Adam: He never comes on irc.
(00:32:44) Jaclyn: I don't care.
(00:32:56) Jaclyn: Really, I don't. I told you I didn't want my shit messed with anymore.
(00:32:58) Jaclyn: that was fact.
(00:33:07) Jaclyn: The little hacking attempt someone did though made me pissed off at your friend.
(00:34:22) Adam: We really shouldn't use the word 'friend'
(00:34:36) Jaclyn: Whatever, aquaintance.
(00:35:03) Adam: I told you I thought the whole thing was boring.
(00:35:07) Jaclyn: Well.
(00:35:43) Jaclyn: If I trusted you, I'd explain that your friend does have a possibility of being in deep shit.
(00:36:06) Jaclyn: I'll explain to you another instance of my own doing.
(00:36:18) Jaclyn: I used to run an IRC server back in the day.
(00:36:25) Jaclyn: and there was this guy.
(00:36:41) Jaclyn: peeeeeeedophile. Like majorly.
(00:37:18) Jaclyn: long story short, a trace of his ip address and he's currently serving jail time for pedophilia, cyber stalking, and some other minor charges.
(00:37:30) Jaclyn: and all I had was a fake ip address.
(00:37:52) Adam: Lmao.
(00:37:59) Adam: Kay let me break it down.
(00:38:00) Jaclyn: n_n.
(00:38:10) Adam: Honestly, any user at any time has unlimited use of bandwidth on sk

(00:42:39) Adam: A bandwidth pedo.
(00:42:49) Jaclyn: Perhaps.
(00:43:16) Jaclyn: I'm not getting into it with you.
(00:43:23) Adam: I'm really interested in what Rob is gonna do.
(00:43:33) Jaclyn: Well, just incase it bites you in the ass.
(00:43:37) Adam: What do you mean "get into it with me"
(00:43:38) Jaclyn: You fail as a troll.
(00:43:44) Jaclyn: I'm not going to explain.
(00:43:53) Adam: Mysterious.
(00:44:10) Adam: I understand that you's be upset because your site is down.
(00:44:13) Adam: I would be to.
(00:44:23) Adam: What Vinland did was uncalled for.
(00:44:30) Jaclyn: Not like you didn't know about it.
(00:44:31) Adam: d*
(00:44:41) Adam: Your point being?
(00:44:55) Jaclyn: Don't come across as an innocent bystander
(00:44:58) Jaclyn: it's kinda annoying.
(00:45:12) Adam: I wrote a few paragraphs in an article.
(00:45:18) Adam: I don't know how to crash a site.
(00:45:22) Jaclyn: The article itself.
(00:45:31) Jaclyn: It isn't what I'm speaking about.
(00:45:56) Jaclyn: It's fine. We're all going to wonder about how Rob is going to handle this.
(00:46:13) Adam: Why are you being mysterious?
(00:46:19) Adam: I don't get the point.
(00:46:50) Jaclyn: I'm not being mysterious, I am not going to spend time explaining to you minor things that can bite you in the ass.
(00:46:50) Jaclyn: :/
(00:46:57) Jaclyn: that's all.
(00:47:16) Adam: Like Rob not being able to reach vinland and attacking me instead?
(00:47:30) Adam: Well, I haven't done anything... so...
(00:47:33) Jaclyn: I told you.
(00:47:35) Adam: Not scared.
(00:47:43) Jaclyn: Vinland revealed himself.
(00:47:48) Jaclyn: Of who he was on s-k.
(00:47:53) Jaclyn: By sheer accident, but he did it.
(00:47:54) Jaclyn: :]
(00:47:58) Adam: He did no such thing.
(00:48:02) Jaclyn: but he did.
(00:48:04) Adam: I would've known.
(00:48:12) Jaclyn: You would have, if you were online.
(00:48:19) Adam: You're lying.
(00:48:24) Jaclyn: Not at all.'
(00:48:27) Adam: Ayup.
(00:48:53) Jaclyn: Think that.
(00:48:54) Jaclyn: it's fine.
(00:49:15) Adam: This bad cop shit isn't working. Hari tried some of it too. I haven't done anything.
(00:49:22) Jaclyn: dude.
(00:49:26) Adam: Can I help that I trolled the forums harmlessly for fun?
(00:49:27) Adam: No
(00:49:29) Jaclyn: We know that you techincally are all just words.
(00:49:38) Adam: I'm not the supervillian.
(00:49:44) Jaclyn: No one's saying you are.
(00:49:59) Jaclyn: and i'm not batman damnit.
(00:50:05) Jaclyn: Because there is no head smashing
(00:50:07) Jaclyn: and growling.
(00:50:11) Jaclyn: and words going. "BRRRRRR"
(00:50:15) Adam: lawl
(00:50:18) Jaclyn: ...cuz really that's all you understand of batman.
(00:50:29) Adam: Hm.
(00:50:34) Adam: Pretty much, yeah.
(00:51:11) Jaclyn: yeah.
(00:51:16) Jaclyn: and you're not cool enough to be joker materal.
(00:51:57) Adam: I resent that.
(00:52:08) Adam: But I'd like to note that I'm also not insane enough.
(00:52:12) Jaclyn: indeed.
(00:52:14) Adam: Which is a good thing.
(00:52:25) Jaclyn: insanity makes all the best people.
(00:52:42) Adam: I always found the Jokers fascination with Batman...
(00:52:48) Adam: semi-homoerotic.</pre>

And after giving up (also notice the '''twice-written''' confession that '''no actual DDoS has ever happened'''; they're just too [[pussy]] to admit their server was so cheap it fell easily via slightly increased loading):
{{co|chatlog2|[^_~]|[xD]|0|
<pre>
(23:25:06) Jaclyn: Let me ask you something right now. I'm so tired of everything on this damned internet. Give me Vinland's email. No bullshit, no nothing. Please.
(23:25:51) Adam: What? I don't know Vinland's email.
(23:26:00) Jaclyn: Bullshit. He emailed you didn't he?
(23:26:06) Adam: Nah.
(23:26:13) Jaclyn: He never contacted you outside of ED?
(23:26:18) Adam: Nope.
(23:26:35) Jaclyn: Did he tell you ANYTHING?
(23:26:49) Adam: Nahh. Why?
(23:26:52) Jaclyn: He fucking won. He needs to stop.
(23:27:01) Jaclyn: There is no point anymore.
(23:27:13) Adam: Won? What happened?
(23:27:20) Jaclyn: The site is closed permanently.
(23:27:25) Adam: ...
(23:27:41) Adam: Woah. What'd he do?
(23:27:54) Jaclyn: He hacked into the site and posted our information.
(23:28:12) Jaclyn: IP addresses are yes, pointless in the grand scheme of things.
(23:28:16) Jaclyn: But its going too far.
(23:28:44) Adam: Sorry.
(23:28:50) Adam: I should watch out, myself.
(23:28:53) Jaclyn: You should
(23:29:05) Jaclyn: The fact is, being you started this this will turn ugly now
(23:29:13) Jaclyn: You will be involved even though you stopped.
(23:29:33) Adam: Started... what O_o?
(23:29:41) Jaclyn: The article.
(23:29:56) Adam: What does that have to do with Vinland closing the site?
(23:30:08) Jaclyn: Rob closed the site out of safety.
(23:30:26) Jaclyn: Vinland didn't like LOIC it to death or whatever.
(23:30:59) Jaclyn: The fact he's trying to send hackers to Rob and Shana is just pushing it. Being that he posted my ip address as Shana's I WILL be the one who gets this.
(23:31:05) Adam: LOIC?
(23:31:11) Jaclyn: The little spamming thing he was doing.
(23:31:55) Jaclyn: I'm really tired of this. I'm absolutely sick of all of this, there was a point. You didn't truly have cruel intentions when this started.
(23:32:23) Jaclyn: offline information is going past "lulzy" and going into putting us in a risk.
(23:32:39) Adam: Talk to him.
(23:32:45) Jaclyn: How?
(23:32:46) Adam: I don't know why you'd want to involve me.
(23:32:49) Adam: I dunno.
(23:33:03) Jaclyn: He was only talking to you.
(23:33:17) Adam: Maybe message him on ed?
(23:33:38) Jaclyn: Hah. Thats just going to send him in my direction.
(23:33:49) Adam: Ask Rob to do it?
(23:34:11) Jaclyn: I'll be honest with you because I do think you are done with ED.
(23:34:21) Jaclyn: Rob has a case apparently.
(23:34:52) Adam: Okay?
(23:35:45) Adam: So?
(23:35:58) Jaclyn: You want to be splattered in all of this anyway?
(23:36:25) Adam: Nah. I'm not involved.
(23:36:39) Adam: Not in the site being taken down, that is.
(23:36:51) Jaclyn: I know that. The site Rob did of his own doing.
(23:36:54) Jaclyn: To try and protect us.
(23:37:24) Adam: Are you saying he's going to try to sue me, lol?
(23:37:29) Jaclyn: Nope.
(23:37:41) Adam: He's going to try to sue Vinland?
(23:38:06) Jaclyn: A subpeona will force ED to give up any information on Vinland.
(23:38:10) Jaclyn: Legally.
(23:38:25) Adam: Subpeonas are expensive.
(23:38:26) Jaclyn: ED wont save his ass, so obviously.
(23:38:36) Jaclyn: True.
(23:39:27) Adam: He'd have better luck trying to sue me.
(23:39:40) Jaclyn: You're not going to be sued.
(23:39:46) Jaclyn: You can't do shit anyway.
(23:40:02) Jaclyn: Even say, you started editing this. Vinland will go behind you and undo it.
(23:40:15) Jaclyn: So you're just there in the middle.
(23:40:32) Adam: Oh well.
(23:40:42) Jaclyn: yeah.
(23:40:50) Jaclyn: but whatever. I tried.
(23:41:06) Jaclyn: I'll have to go on the fact I have no choice but to believe you.
(23:41:26) Adam: I wouldn't believe me. You don't even know me.
(23:41:40) Jaclyn: Yes.
(23:41:41) Jaclyn: I don't.
(23:42:07) Jaclyn: Besides, I have an idea who Vinland is anyway.
(23:42:31) Adam: Can't you just ip search him or something?
(23:42:33) Adam: Idk...
(23:42:38) Jaclyn: He's on a proxy lol.
(23:42:47) Jaclyn: if it really is a he.
(23:43:03) Adam: Females don't act like him.
(23:43:18) Jaclyn: You would think not.
(23:43:35) Jaclyn: But a really good liar could make you question their gender on the internet.
(23:44:23) Adam: *shrug*

'Aejae' aka "[[USI|Enforcer]]" aka Allison DeLaCruz is the sad, masochistic virgin who [[Talk:Seto-Kaiba.com|blindly tries to weasel her way]] to getting this article deleted (generating much lulz for us in the process). She gets off to vandalizing and editing this page non-stop to the point of crushing her own desk chair schlicking to this article when seen blank. She constantly tries to ask ED sysops to take down this page, and considering Robert's intelligence and success, everything went just as the feared and revered leader had [[banned|precisely planned]] for his trusted subordinate:

==A Crushing Failure==
[[File:Seto-kaiba.com-defeat.jpg|thumb|right|Robert, [[trying too hard|still]] pretending he had a choice on the matter.]]
'''April 2010''': Declaring complete and unconditional surrender, Robert has finally started facing facts, staring at defeat while twitching at a rate that would make [[sparta|Xerxes]] turn in his grave; he has taken the [[an hero|only dignified decision Hitler was left with]] during his last days. '''All because someone said some baaad things about him in a page on the internet'''. So much for his idea of a 'social network'. Fortunately, since he never learns, he'll try to find a way to reappear without [[lol|anyone noticing]] soon enough.
{{quote|I'm done with this. You guys win, everyone else is going too.|[[User:Trolldoll|Trolldoll]], suspected of being the [[pussy|man]] himself}}

==Learning from their mistakes==
[[File:S-kdotcom_tries_to_hijack_skdotcom.jpg|thumb|right|In a final act of [[batshit insane|desperation]], Robert attempted to impersonate somebody from a far superior [http://www.kaibacorporation.com Kaiba Corporation] (reportedly someone Robert personally banned on his own site), resulting in this bulletin on theirs.

[[File:SK-alwaysthesharpest.jpg|center]]

===Be [[hax|vewwy vewwy quiet]]...===

As [[typical|expected]], they've [http://hiderefer.com/?http://seto-kaibadotcom.usersboard.net resurfaced] once again to attempt to plague the internet with more of their [[faggotry]].

'''PROTIP:''' You can [http://www.seto-kaiba.com purchase this domain] and have it [[win|redirect to this article]] for them to start a new lulzy [[lolcow|tirade]] at it.

==Conclusion==

Much of their recent, desperate [[taking down ED|attempts]] to revive their [[old]] glories matter little to anyone these days; they [[fucked|permanently lost their precious home on the web]], and are doomed to [[bawww|remember]] their loss for the rest of their sorry, miserable lives, hiding at whatever [[secret]] [[shithole|trench]] they heave their overweight asses into.
