Aelius

One of many [[conservative]] [[internet tough guys]], {{lj|aelius}} is best known for his spiteful, rage-filled rants in the [[LJ]] [[Conservatism]] community. 

Aelius is famed for his racism, bigotry, and his bouts of drunkenness, which are the best times to debate him. He will either be much less hostile, or incensed to the point of near riot, both of which are amusing on a slow night. It is believed that he has not yet been banned from [[conservatism]] for this reason. Fortunately, next to nobody takes him seriously anymore. Even [[conservatism]] regulars often tell him to [[STFU]].

Little is known about chirogrl, his wife; however, what knowledge we do have is exactly what one expects from someone who agreed to stick by [[aelius]] till death do they part. A conservative Christian chiropractor, she was violently ejected from {{ljcomm|weddingplans}} following a rant about how she was "so sick of hearing about all the gays getting married, and do we really have to allow lesbians in here?" She is widely credited for inspiring the formerly agnostic aelius to convert to fundamentalist Christianity overnight.

When levenator was made a mod of [[conservatism]], [[aelius]] posted a lengthy rant in protest on February 19, 2005. The post earned over 350 comments, most of which called him a raging douche. In typical fashion, he duly deleted the entire post hours later. 

Aelius and chirogrl are expecting their first child, who has the sympathies of liberals, libertarians, and conservatives alike. He/she is expected to become either a [[Democrat]], [[homosexual]], an [[atheist]], or some combination of the three.

As with most far-right conservo-freaks, he has some sockpuppets on hand. Aliases include {{lj|billybumbleroy}}, [[stoned_hippie]] and {{lj|happy_fun_ball}}.
