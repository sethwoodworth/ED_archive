In the era of [[web 2.0]], many netizens get impression that they have the power, at any given time, to create their own movement -- blind to the fact that community they represent is essentially controlled by a group of Jew geared on exploiting them, [[lol]].  So next time you make a thread, remember, '''<i>X</i> is not your personal army''', and [[you]] probably have a serious case of [[unwarranted self-importance]].

== Contradiction? In my ED? Yes. ==
While it is quite easy to make smaller, [[4chan|failfag]] sites into your personal army, there is only one way it can really work. Similarly, there is only one way it should be done, and luckily, it is the same way. It's quite easy, really...

# First, find a failfag site with a very strong viewpoint. Any extreme left/right politics site, [[furfags]], religions, etc.
# Go on that site, and [[troll]] epically by stating views that are the opposite to theirs. Ensure major pissed-offness, not just for major lulz, but also so the next stage of the plan works.
# Blame a similarly failfag site with the opposite viewpoint. Having been invaded themselves, the invadees will doubtlessly respond in kind.
#????
#Profit!
