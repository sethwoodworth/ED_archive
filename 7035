Like otherkin, robokin are supreme [[Asperger's syndrome|aspie]]s who believe they are not human; rather, [[robot]]s. Robokin differ from [[furries]] and [[otherkin]] in that robokin usually are robots of some kind. [[Special]] robots. Robokin are obsessed with [[Mechanophilia]].

Robokin are [[self-important]] [[camwhore]]s. They invented [[internet disease]], because they are "perfect by design."

Almost without exception, robokin are diarrhea-lapping [[boring]]. Many will attribute this to their ability to maintain jobs, spouses and successful lives to their robot like condition, meaning that their computer brain is too [[leet|1337]] 4 u. Others are secretly robokin, and if you ask them they will deny it to the death. Which is fine, because they don't do anything but go to work, eat batteries, and have sex with computers.
