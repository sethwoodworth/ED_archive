Streisand Effect

The '''Streisand Effect''' is a term used to describe a commonly seen occurrence on the [[internet]] when somebody attempts to [[censor]] or remove some kind of information, documentation or photograph but somehow manages to forget that magic 'save as...' function that 99.9% of computers have. The censor ultimately ends up creating more buzz via censoring the file / image / document than if they simply just settled the fuck down and realized that [[nobody cares|nobody actually cared about them in the first place]].

The Streisand Effect was coined after Barbra Streisand, who in 2003 sued a photographer [[google|for posting a picture of her home on the interwebs]]. Of course, nobody has ever given a fuck about Barbra other than [[Jews|her core demographic]] and [[tfo|faggots]] looking to [[whore]] her "[[Shit|music]]" to the masses, but after the news broke out that she was suing the photographer, the site's hits started coming in and more people eventually saw the photo than if Babs had just [[stfu]] in the first place. The irony is that the photographer was actually taking photos for an article on [[environmentalism|coastal erosion]], causing Barbra to look like an even bigger fool.

== Causes ==

[[IRL]], this effect is known as "gossip". [[Back in the day]] when people had real lives, it was an interesting pasttime for many to spread details about other people in the community. If these details were "[[Gay|secret]]" or "[[taboo]]" that just made them more interesting. [[IRL]] the effect was normally limited thanks to people having the same [[Gay|issue]] or not wanting the subject of the gossip to know they were spreading rumors. Effective equivalents of [[proxies]] were rare, but bathroom walls and [[tabloids]] could be used to similar effect. 

Basic human behaviour combined with the relative anonymity and ease of communication [[OTI]] leads to [[Clusterfuck|the usual results]] - you get a thousand [[retards]] [[You|with nothing better to do]] trying to play [[Internet Humanitarianism|vigilant guardians]] of the sacred principles of [[free speech]] by spreading shit [[nobody cares]] about.
