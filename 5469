Monster
The word [[Monster]] can mean many things:

# The type of user [[Ohbutyouwillpet]] is.
# The REM album.  It, like an actual monster, tends to [[suck]].
# Your average citizen of [[Israel]].
# [[Al Gore]].  Important to note that he is a [[robots|robotic]] monster.
# [[Quasidan's penis]].
# A [http://www.monster.com website] where people upload their [[resume]]s.  Nobody actually reads them except for your current personnel director, who will fire you if she finds you on there.
# Audio cables which people will spend $300 for, only to receive ten feet of cable, bling-bling connectors, and 1 inch of air around the conductor, to improve adroitness.
# An energy drink, not to be confused with other foods and drink that do not give you energy.
