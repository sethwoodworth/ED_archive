'''James Randi''', or '''[[truth|Randall James Hamilton Zwinge]],''' is an 80th level Garden Gnome Magician and a [[bullshit|psychic's]] worst nightmare. A self proclaimed skeptic and [[lulz killer]], he has made it his life mission to [[Hitler|purge the world]] of all mysticism, pseudo-science, and fun. His enemies include [[Peter Popoff]], a televangelist with a prosthetic penis, [[Chancepsych]], a Jewish black homo who believes he has the ability to channel the dead, [[Uri Geller]], a magician who claims to be [[srsly]] psychic, and other douche bags with lots of [[Jew Gold|money]]. Every time a new celebrity rises to fame claiming to have [[Jesus|God-powers]], Randi is there to [[rape|teach]] them a lesson. His main weapon of choice is a cheque worth [[over 9000|$1,000,000]], which he offers to anyone who can prove their powers under a controlled test. After 40 years, no one has won that money, because Randi and his followers [[cheating|rig]] the tests.

Before his crusades against [[lulz|good times]] began, Randi was a stage magician. This would seem like blatant [[hypocrisy]] at first <s>because it is</s>, but when one looks closer, they will see that it isn't. Randi always noted that his illusions were just that &mdash;<b>illusions</b>. That's why magicians are officially called '''illusionists'''. He never claimed that he had psychic powers, telepathy, or any paranormal abilities.

==Biography==
Randi was born on [[Christmas|December 25th]], [[Creationism|4004 BC]]. His mother was a [[virgin]] who became pregnant after a stack of library books fell on her. Three wise men &mdash; [[philosophy|David Hume]], [[evolution|Charles Darwin]] and [[atheist|Bertrand Russell]]&mdash;turned up at the stable in which he was born, and informed him he was Satan's Messiah. He was bestowed with magic powers like [[Uri Geller|spoon bending]], [[Alternative Medicine|miraculous healing powers]] and [[X-men|the ability to move compasses]], as well as an uncanny ability to make miracles look like sleight-of-hand.

When he was 7, Randi confirmed his pact with the Devil after tearing the head off a live rabbit and fucking it in the neckhole. After this, Randi became immortal, so he doesn't appear to have aged since about 1960. His black magic has fooled many [[Satanism|atheists]], all of whom are destined to burn in the eternal fires of [[Heaven|Hell]].

Randi's ancient crackly videos transfer remarkably well to the medium of [[YouTube]] and appear to debunk supernatural powers in [[amerifag|easy-to-handle]] snippets. This is due to his paranormal abilities to see into the future, back in the 70s when he was mildly famous.

==James Hydrick==
Way back in the Paleolithic Era, Randi was on a program called ''That's My Line'', wherein a mystical man named James Hydrick was going to make things move by the magical power of telekinesis. After a brief demonstration, Randi put Styrofoam on to the pages Hyrick was supposed to move. The presence of Styrofoam miraculously defeated Hydrick's powers. Randi claimed that this was because Hydrick was blowing, but no-one will ever truly know what Satanic curse was actually unleashed upon the poor ex-convict.

Hydrick is now [http://www.meganslaw.ca.gov/cgi/prosoma.dll?zoomAction=Box&zoomAction=clickcenter&zoomAction=clickoffender&lastName=Hydrick&firstName=James&Address=&City=&zipcode=&searchDistance=.75&City2=&countyLocation=&zipcode2=&SelectCounty=&ParkName=&searchDistance2=.75&City3=&zipcode3=&countyLocation3=&schoolName=&searchDistance3=.75&City4=&zipcode4=&countyLocation4=&refineID=&pan=&distacross=107211&centerlat=38409907&centerlon=-121514242&starlat=&starlon=&startext=&x1=&y1=&x2=&y2=&mapwidth=525&mapheight=400&zoom=&searchBy=namelist&id=&docountycitylist=2&OFDTYPE=&lang=ENGLISH an incarcerated sex offender, found guilty of MOUTH RAPE on a girl aged under 14.] Randi's powers know no limit.

==Peter Popoff==
[[Image:Peter Popoff scam.jpg|thumb|Hear me, you gullible idiots!]]
In the early 80's, [[Peter Popoff|Peter "''Slimy Fuck''" Popoff]] was busy scamming [[Christians]] out of money. Claiming to be a "faith healer", he would host televised services in which [[evangelical|black people]] with [[AIDS]] would throw their small amount of money at him, and in return would be "[[lie|healed]]".  None of them even had a clue that Peter Popoff wasn't even the guy's real name, but was merely his stage name from when he used to work in porn. Popoff's baffling power was to know secrets about audience members, which he could only have got directly from [[Stupid|God telling him]]. James Randi and his beard smelt [[bullshit]]. On ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'', Randi exposed to the world that Popoff was using an earbud with his wife on the other end to [[Stalk|gain this knowledge]] about the [[stupid|crowd members]]. Popoff immediately filed bankruptcy and then disappeared to the Forbidden Forest to feed on unicorn blood until strong enough to return. 

And return he did. After 20 years in darkness, Popoff and his [[man|wife]] returned to the scene, slimier than ever. Instead of traveling the country hosting "miracle crusades", Popoff is now [[coward|running infomercials on late-night television]]. Presumably, stepping outside is incredibly dangerous for him, seeing as Randi is always near. ''Inside Edition'' produced a special expose on Peter Popoff, interviewing James Randi once again. However, this might not be enough to end the fucker's career this time around. We need [[you|your]] help. Yeah, you! Please consult [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm0cf-TNVDs&feature=channel this video] for instructions (skip the first minute or so; the filmmaker is an [[Atheist|idiot]]).

==[[Uri Geller]]==
Around the same time, Geller was at the peak of his career. He was best known for bending spoons, reading minds, and being a Jew. Randi, being the [[Hero|antisemite]] he is, exposed Geller [[At least 100|countless times]]. Surprisingly, [[denial|Geller continues to claim he possesses supernatural power]], making him the laughing stock of, well, [[basement dweller|anyone who knows about James Randi]].

===Response===
[[Last Thursday|Recently]], Geller released a statement regarding the [[Everyone|skeptics]] who are exposing him on [[YouTube]]. In a nutshell, he acts like a cocky asshole and [[rage|thanks these skeptics for the free publicity]].

{{squote|The people who are uploading these videos on YouTube, imagining that they are exposing me, are really giving me priceless exposure. Theyâ€™re creating the most brilliant free publicity I could ever have, and certainly manufacturing more controversy... thus enhancing the mystery and mystique around Uri Geller.|[http://site.uri-geller.com/to_all_skeptics_-_a_big_thank_you You rage you lose.]}}

{{squote|[[No U]]!|Geller's only way out of the argument.}}

Obviously Geller's true views on the matter are much different. In the 90's, Geller [[butthurt|filed a lawsuit]] against Randi in response to a book he wrote called ''The Truth about Uri Geller''. This book gave [[spoiler|spoilers]] on the secrets behind Geller's tricks, and ultimately exposed him as a fraud. At this point, it had become a habit of Randi's to kick Geller's ass regularly, and he didn't stop here. The lawsuit [[fail|failed]], and [[irony|the courts actually made Uri Geller pay James Randi $150,000!]] [[lol|LOL]]!

==Project Alpha==
Randi again used his black magick to befuddle the scientific community with "Project Alpha". In this, he chose two lesser-demons to work with him in throwing doubt to the reality of their Satanic powers. These two vile beings then bent spoons in front of [[retarded|brilliant]] scientists, who let them fuck around with (bend) the spoons beforehand. The scientists had obviously missed elementary physics, because they believed these guys and thought they had found proof for magic. [[Bob Rehahn|Double blind tests]] and scientific [[balls|rigor]] next time plz.

Randi then announced that this was all a hoax and the two boys weren't actually supermen, making the [[Over 9000|billions]] of dollars of money spent on this kind of stuff look pointless. Which it obviously isn't.

Uri Geller has also been tested by scientists, but he is a genuine miracle-worker, so no parallels can be drawn.

<center><video type="youtube" id="z1S5CRcqJQo" width="350" Height="350 frame="true" position="center"/></center><br>

The scientists have now been retrained as plasterers &mdash; a job they can actually do.

==Sylvia Browne==
Sylvia Browne, of ''[[Montel Williams|Montel]]'' and ''[[Larry King]]'' fame, is one of Randi's more recent preferred targets. This [[bitch|witch]] tries to speak to the dead; however, it is usually a [[Prank Call|prank call]] because she seems to end up being wrong whenever facts are ascertained.

James Randi asked her to take part in his [[Copyright|Million Dollar Challenge]], and she accepted. This was [[Completely irrelevant history|a long time ago]], but she has so far [[Coward|refused]] to get conclusively proven [[bullshit|false]]. Randi will therefore never miss an opportunity to encourage his followers to [[Living On A Prayer|pray]] for her [[fail|demise]]. Because secretly, he knows this works.

If you ever needed more proof that the old bitch is a phony.

==[[Alternative Medicine|Homeopathic Medicine]]==
[[Image:Headon_(1).jpg|thumb|The other .1% is [[sperm|cum]].]]

James Randi has been a long time critic of "homeopathic medicine", that is, medicine that uses the <i>least</i> amount of main ingredients. An example of homeopathic medicine would be HeadOn, the glue stick that "cures headaches". After [[science|extensive research]], Randi concluded that the gel-bar of HeadOn is composed of 99.9% wax. Being a man who likes his [[drugs]] [[gay|strong and long-lasting]], he was outraged. 

Like all his enemies before this, Randi smote this product and all other homeopathic (more like <b>homo</b>pathetic, [[amirite]]?) drugs into [[hell|intellectually checkmate]]. How? You can view the [[pwnage]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYFwT1LcBdI here].

==Gay==
[[Image:JamesRandi1.jpg|thumb|'''RULE 34. NAO.''']]
James Randi is also a [[faggot]] ([http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/914-how-to-say-it.html proof]). He announced his gayness to the world at age 81 and just before he was going to die, maybe because, with his keen objective eye, he realised that nobody would pay attention to [[Criss Angel|another faggy magician]].

==Responses from the [[13 year old girl|psychic community]]==
{{quote|James Randi sucks.
I tell you why.
Someone go to his show to win 1 million because he was gonna prove that psi exists so he go there and prove it but James Randi doesn't give the 1 mil ... and if u had psi abilities u wouldn't go to show just to prove psi exists would you?
all those ppl are going to think ur mental retarded
get over it, [[bullshit|its proven psi is real]] ... kids nowadays ...|Proof that PSI exists.}}

{{quote|Mr. James Randi is a fraud and a coward who believes that making a contract with the world can be broken by him because he controls the money.|[http://forum.mind-energy.net/mind-energy-net-posts/161-james-randis-challenge-illusion.html lolwut]}}

{{quote|James Randi worked for years as a psychic, and wrote books teaching "Psychic development" btw before deciding he'd make more money out of debunking.|Butt-hurt liar obviously lying.}}

{{quote|This reads [[old meme|moar liek]] an Uncyclopedophilia article. It leads to strange suspicions that the article's creator is one of Randi's fanboys. But then again, [[USI|most people seem to be unaware]] of how best to attack this gnome wizard. I have a suggestion. Note that his "challenge" specifically disqualifies people no one ever heard of; they only accept celebrity psychics. The site claims that this rule was made later on because too many frauds were costing them too much money. [[insane|Moar liek fear of getting pwnt if you ask me]]. Another thing to use against him is the fact that he [[hypocrite|isn't actually a scientist]], and that the James Randi Foundation's standards are similarly unscientific.|Article appears to troll well.}}

==How to Troll James Randi [[13 year old boy|Fans]]==
As much as you might respect this [[hero]], James Randi's fans are, like anyone's fans, [[mac|incredibly annoying and elitist.]] The dogma and mysticism they sought to escape has returned in their community, with Randi acting as their God and [[lemon party|fapping material]]. They will eat up any shit he feeds them, without question. Obviously, trolling these motherfuckers is very [[fun]]. Their current lair is [http://forums.randi.org/ here], but feel free to troll his YouTube videos too. Supreme trolling techniques include:
*Call Randi a hypocrite. Say that he worked as a psychic before he became a professional skeptic, and only switched because the latter was more Jew.
*Say that PSI is a proven [[fact]], and that the [[At least 100|majority]] of [[Scientology|scientists]] accept it.
*Tell them that Randi is giving Uri Geller tons of free [[attention|publicity]]. Link them to [http://site.uri-geller.com/to_all_skeptics_-_a_big_thank_you this page]. Also, inform them that Uri Geller has been tested and is [[bullshit|proven to have psychic powers]].
*If all else [[fail]]s, link them to [[meatspin]].

==Similarities to [[Wise Beard Man]]==
[[Image:JamesRandi3.jpg|thumb|In fact, the two have never been seen together. '''SAME PERSON??''']]
[[Some argue]] that James Randi and Wise Beard Man are very similar. The comparisons include:
*Both are enemies of supernatural bullshit.
*Both have beards that would put [[Karl Marx]] to shame.
*Both will probably be assassinated at some point.
