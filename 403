Amazon Disaster
Once upon a time, stores used to offer ridiculous sales that would have people lined up around the block before the store even opened. This would often result in [[death]] by trampling and [[lulz]]y fights between [[Your mom|middle aged women]] in track suits over ugly sweaters.[[Image:Shoppingmob.jpg|thumb|120px|Sweaters! Sweeeeeaters!]]

[[Amazon|Amazon.com]] decided to attempt to get this sort of result in [[2006]] on [[Thanksgiving]] Day by offering 1000 [[XBox 360]]s for 100 USD. Purchasing one of these consoles was to be an easy process. One simply had to be on the site at 11:00 AM, vote for something, enter a code, and complete a simple math question correctly (to weed out the [[Nigeria|Nigerians]], no doubt).



==Oh Shi-==

Unfortunately, [[Amazon|Amazon.com]] forgot that the [[Internet]] isn't [[real life]]. Instead of resulting in [[lulz]] and [[death]], it resulted in about 100 million people frantically refreshing multiple browsers. The [[internet]] pulled down the metal security gate on that shit. Millions of [[fat]] [[fucks]] everywhere stared at their screens in disbelief while [[Nigeria|Nigerians]] everywhere tribal-danced with joy. (Apparently, they are better at simple math than [[Americans]]. Who knew?)

==End Result==

[[Image:Turkey.jpg|thumb|120px|Fuck you, Amazon.com]]Thousands of [[fat]] [[fucks]] everywhere died from impacted colons after demolishing whole turkeys to sedate their [[fail]]-related depression.
