March Together For Life
{{potential}}

== The Site ==

March Together For Life is a [[pro-life]] blog advocating the end of [[legal]] [[abortion]] rights. It is run by a fellow named Pete. [[IRL]], Pete thinks he is a pretty [[smart]] cookie, but as we know, the [[internet]] makes fools of us all. Especially a hard-headed male that spends every waking moment trying to claim mining rights on uteruses (uteri?) all over the [[USA]].

== The Motherfucking Ay'yo Cockup ==
March Together For Life gained notoriety for publishing an article entitled ''Murder Without Conscience'', criticizing the glib attitude towards abortion written by one Caroline Weber in the online/IRL [[newspaper]] ''[[The Onion]]''. Pete was apparently unaware that The Onion is a very well known news satire site. Pete was also apparently unaware of the [[Owned|voraciousness]] of Intarweb Citizens, and after being lambasted in real life, had his left arm and half of his [[penis]] torn off. Eyewitnesses interviewed stated "Well, after we tore him and his arguments to shreds, we figured why not go for the [[motherfucking]] gusto?"

[[Internet_police|Police investigators]] state that an investigation is ongoing, but then recalled the ongoing investigation, stating "[[Fuck]] Pete."

== Fallout ==

After over 500 comments on the '''Murder Without Conscience''' article, Pete attempted to salvage his pride by stating that he was aware that ''The Onion'' contains [[satirical]] [[articles]]. After over 500 comments on his followup article, Pete desperately tried to regain ground with this delightfully poorly-worded brainfart:

'' He signed his string of filth with "Color me stunned ... douchebag". His name is [[douchebag]]? ...& what color is "stunned"?''

Pete's demonstrated knack for comedy could very well make him one of the kings of Teh [[Funny|Funney]]. What color is stunned, indeed? Thankfully, we can rest easy knowing that people like Pete are out there, solving problems such as these. 

In one night, one dumb fucker managed to set back the online pro-life movement [[At_least_100_years|at least 100 years]].

== [[Controversy]] ==

There have been reports that Pete is actually a fetus that was aborted, but survived.

Though he/it has a [[Cripple|bare minimum of motor functions]] and [[Autistic|less than basic comprehension of reality]], this is more than enough to crank out craptacular blog articles, and fight so very hard to retain what little pride he might have had.
