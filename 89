'''420chan''', run by [[Kirtaner]], a [[banhammer|reject]] from [[Something Awful]] and pedophile who decided to create a site with more specialized boards covering those facets of internet culture which not even [[4chan]]'s /b/, the toilet of the [[internet]], dares to cover, is an imageboard mostly filled with a strange combination of completely stoned people, [[video games]], and [[gay|wrestling]] lovers.  Its origins are shrouded in [http://420chan.org/what.htm complete and total mystery].420chan has no memes for the simple reason no one can remember them.

420chan has a wide array of shitty boards, each with a regular userbase of around 4 people (although [[some argue]] it's just [[samefag|one guy on a proxy]]); this includes an Xbox hueg variety of [[drug]] boards, [[Pokemon|/po/kemon]] (superior to [[shit nobody cares about|papercraft and origami]]), /sh/enanigans (filled with the sort of people that made dorm life suck), and intellectual boards like [[flamewar|philosophy]] and [[politics]] (filled with stoners trying to sound smart and not making sense 100% of the time). They also have the original versions of boards like /dino/ that [[7chan|nobody important]] copied. One notable aspect is that its music board allows [[WIN|direct file uploads]] so that you can share music instead of [[7chan|discussing it while desperately looking for the torrent]]. 

[[Image:420chan.PNG|thumb|An outdated survey that does not reflect the increase in Pokémon over the years.]]

420chan tends to be where [[13 year old boy|stupid kids]] go to brag about how much weed they smoke. From time to time, it gets clogged up with a combination of displaced teenage fuckups, with their battle cries of "OMG MAD CHRONIC YO" and [[newfags]] banned from [[4chan]] for being too gay even for 4chan's /b/.

When 4chan is down, 420chan is typically one of the first places they go, [[7chan]] [[lol|usually being down]]. /B/tards from 4chan are normally accepted as long as they leave their [[AIDS]] and [[fail]] behind at 4chan when they post, those that don't usually end up [[B&]].

==The Leaders==

===[[Kirtaner]]===
At first glance, Kirtaner (also known as skirt boy) appears to be a faggot [[12chan|pedo]] black person with [[basement dweller|no friends]], but to many he is the daddy of the greatest board in the universe. Kirtaner is kind of like the guy in [[you|your]] band that is the lead singer which makes him technically the leader, even though all the rest of the band really does is make fun of him. When he's not posting pictures of himself in a skirt, he's jerking off to sum innocent [[13 year old boys]]. It is also highly speculated that he had a love affair with [[feem]] and a Large sized bottle of strawberry lube.

[[Kirtaner|As if you ever wanted to, you can read moar about their glorious leader here.]]

[[Image:Kirtaner_in_a_skirt.jpg|thumb| Ironically enough, this became a 420chan.org banner.]]


===[[Spardot]]===
[[Kirtaner]]'s girlfriend (HOLYSHIT Kirtaner isn't gay? zomgnowai!) and an all around [[attention whore]], is only an admin because she will suck Kirtaner's [[dick]] (even though she will suck any dick longer than half an inch). By day, she swings her monstrous [[ban hammer]] and then let's the same fags she banned back if they bug her on IRC. Then she sucks their dicks. [[Sparto|Find out more here.]]

[[TL;DR|Oh, and there are some other mods too, but nobody gives a shit about them.]]

===Fun Facts!===

[[Image:Kshot.jpg|thumb|Kirtaner and Spardot, in the heat of a 420chan Drink-a-thon.]]

[[Image:CaptainTinal.JPG|thumb|Captain Tinal, the return of the boxed menace.]]

420chan has a unique spin on DONATE OR DIE: If you donate enough, the admins die. '''420chan Drink-a-thons''' are always stickied in advance with something saying for every 10 dollars, Tinal will take a shot of various alcoholic beverages via live Stickam feed. However, the price is usually raised higher when they realize they don't want him to die. It's ok, it comes close enough; what usually happens is that people donate slowly, and he transforms into a robot and [[stoned|does random things]]. Eventually he will pass out in his own vomit, someone will call 911 to go save him, and then everyone ignores his stream while Kirtaner takes over.  When Kirtaner passes out, Sparto will put on a Guy Fawkes mask and a funny hat and not show tits for the begging crowds because she's a bitch.

420chan used to contain a secret board, /pedo/. After much retarded drama with their original webhost, [[BAWWW|/pedo/ has never returned]].

Those lovable rascals that are the staff of 420 and its irc also have been known to treat their members to cp free of charge!

PS: That's Chalupa in the background. The greatest man to ever live.

==Drama==

===Site Drama===
1. Tinal took over 420chan because Kirt was away.  [[Image:420chancurrentstate.jpg|thumb|Former State Thanks To Tinal]]

2. All the boards were renamed and Kirt had to hack the server to get it back or something equally [[1337]].

3. At a later time, Tinal got mad at Kirt concerning Sparto and killed the 420chan.org domain. They later hugged and made up. Rumors of alleged gay sex also arose but these were denied by the Admins/

====Continued Drama====

On or about November 5th, 2008 [[Tinal]] and [[Kirtaner]] had an argument; leading Tinal to hold the 420chan.org domain hostage (again...) along with all of the PayPal donations, which returned shortly after.

'''[[Tinal/convologs#Jew_Rage|LOGS HERE]]'''
<br /><br />
A whois indicated that Tinal redirected 420chan's DNS servers to 4chan, but failed epically, as nothing actually loaded. (On a side note, this further corroborates claims by some that Tinal is actually [[Moot]] in disguise)
<br /><br />
Tinalrage seems to be over for the moment.

===April Fool's "Drama"===
April Fools [[2008]], [[Kirtaner]] makes a blog post about finding [[Jesus]] or something. It was honestly the shittiest April Fool's trick ever because [[Noone|Peter]] actually fell for it.

===/i/nsurgent drama===

====Hal Turner====
In February of aught-seven, [[Hal Turner]]'s websites started redirecting to 420chan. Hal announced that he had been [[pwnt]] and told everyone he'd called the [[party van]]. It remains to be seen whether some stoner really did steal his password, or Hal made it all up as part of his fiendish plot.

====Perverted Justice====
Chris Hansen and friends got Kirtaner's dox ([[The_internet|from WHOIS]]).  Kirt [[basement dweller|lives with his mom]].  They called and harassed him and his mother in a manner that Anonymous would to Hal, and were just really fucking annoying.  Needs moar backraid.

===Failnonymous - the INTERNET DOODLE MACHINE===

[[Image:420FailFails.jpg|thumb|New 420chan logo on [[Drawball]].]]

420chan was always eager to rid itself of its image as the [[Retard|retarded]] cousin of the *chan family. Powerless to do anything to the other chans, it focused its attention on the [[Moralfags]] in [[Project Chanology]] due to the members of the project referring to themselves as [[Anonymous]], something which pissed off the 420channers to no end.

At first the idea was to crash the project's [[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY/IRL_PROTEST_PAGE|IRL Raids]], which was quickly abandoned when the [[Basement-dweller|420channers]] realized that they were unable to leave their parents' basements. After a series of pathetically failed [[i|raids]] against other sites unrelated to the [[Moralfags]], including DDoSing themselves when trying to take down [[Enturbulation]], they decided to take on a project with some possibility of success: Raid the [[Moralfags|Moralfag]] stronghold on [[Drawball]]. The date was set to April 3rd, 2008.

[[Epic fail]] ensued.

Unable to even scribble out the [http://www.drawball.com/7hvfskx logo] in question, the Anonymous of [[Basement-dweller|420chan]] would thereafter be referred to only as Failnonymous - the INTERNET DOODLE MACHINE.

The other chans were either sympathetic to the cause of Project Chanology, or didn't give a [[Poo|shit]]. After failing miserably at scribbling out the [[Moralfags|Moralfag]] text on [[Drawball]], Failnonymous started spamming other chans with requests for help. They were met with auto-bans from the [[Moderator|mods]].

===The Great One Man Raid of '08===
After being rejected from 4chan !4X8vLLNDE2 had nowhere to go, he decided to tell all his AIM buddies that he was going to raid 420chan's /weed/ board. Here is an excerpt from one of his many [[gay|convos]]:
    '''DarXsAsUsKE:''' sup lol.
    '''!4X8vLLNDE2:''' nm just jacking off lol.
    '''DarXsAsUsKE:''' SHOOTING UR LAZ0RZ!! LOL
    '''DarXsAsUsKE:''' LOL
    '''!4X8vLLNDE2:''' SPAAAARTAAAA!
    '''!4X8vLLNDE2:''' hehe
    '''!4X8vLLNDE2:''' w00t ^-^
    '''DarXsAsUsKE:''' did you see the latest episode of [[gay|Naruto]]?
    '''!4X8vLLNDE2:''' YEAH IT WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOODD LEE-SAN IS SOOOOO KAWAII!!!
    
    ...
    
    '''!4X8vLLNDE2:''' lulz im gonna raid 420chan brb1lol!
    '''!4X8vLLNDE2:''' kkk haha
    '''!4X8vLLNDE2:''' fried chikns!! HAHAHAa, what music shld i listn to wen i raid??????????????????
    '''DarXsAsUsKE:''' Insane Clown Posse

    '''!4X8vLLNDE2:''' g2g my mom wantsme to eat dinner >:("

After that enthralling IM he ate dinner (ricearoni) he went down to his room in the basement and started trolling /weed/. Who could forget such epic lulzworthy posts from !4X8vLLNDE2 such as:

    "this will probably make it on ED though seeing how 420'ers cry when there board gets raided"

and
   
    "they give this reaction sage sage sage sage sage so infact they have given lulz"

and this little gem

    "hahaa LULZ is a CORRUPTIN OF LOL!"

You have done the [[faggots|leegin]] proud [[13 year old|young]] Anon. We salute you.

===Accidental Birth===
[[Shit nobody cares about|Some site called 420chan.net existed first.]]  Kirtaner made 420chan.org as a joke, and in response to the 420chan.net guy crying made it a real imageboard.  It was better.  End of story.

===Eventual Death===
The 10k GET was the album cover of The Scorpions "[[Virgin Killer]]", which featured a nude preteen, but was censored. Its not CP, as it's on Amazon.com as well as various other websites.

Anyway, the 10K GET was, obviously, stickied. 420chans host got scared and said "you're movin' with your auntie and uncle OFFLINE". The IP got redirected to nothing, and Kirt got hit with a CP notice.

Kirt called bullshit, because it's a fucking album cover freely available in stores and websites. Their host didn't care, refused to reply, and eventually closed the ticket. Kirtaner and Tinal told them to fuck off and canceled their account, and are currently moving to a new host. The biggest issue was finding one that will allow /i/ to be linked (although /i/ won't actually be hosted there).

===The Glorious Rebirth Of 420chan===
420chan has officially risen from the ashes. Its timing coincided with the fall of 4chan. With the death of this unholy beast, thousands of /b/tards were left homeless and set sail on small crafts headed for new lands. Most of them died and landed in [[hell|7chan]], however a sizable number made their way to 420chan where they compete for lulz and shelter with the natives who have just arrived from their exodus.

Unfortunately, some of the refugees unknowingly brought [[the cancer that is killing /b/]] to their new homeland. The influx of newfags and copypasta whores has lead to a split amongst the ranks of 420chan, some calling for the ban of all 4channers, others seeking a peaceful union of the two /b/s. Early flooding of the 420 /b/ by an unidentified 4channer has already sparked violent reactions from the locals. As these events escalated, the admins were nowhere to be found.  No surprise there.

Also of important note, during the initial hour that 420 first emerged, someone had already begun a jailbait thread which included many pictures of children under the age of 12. Again, no surprise there. 420channers are still awaiting the repost of the Scorpions album picture "Virgin Killers."

====/i/'s rebirth====
420chan's /i/ was hard to host, and it took months before /i/ returned to 420.  An agreement was reached with 711chan (whose host is ok with /i/) and about merging their /i/ with Kirt's custom wakaba board, returning Kirtaner and Sparto to being admins along with some #insurgency ops and 711chan admins, creating a new era of peace.  This /i/ is currently trying to restore /i/'s good name with traditional Yahoo Answers trolling, more MySpace phishing, and extracting some lulz from the new s& hero.

====Lockdown Level: [[Party Hard]]====
Whenever 4chan dies, 7chan dies right after.  While 420channers are not as hateful of other chan sites as [[7chan]] and [[4chan]] types are, they really don't like them coming and fagging up the place by posting so fast and what-have-you.  So, 420chan changes its theme to RAVE mode, aka PARTY HARD, as a diversion.

===Mascots & Sub-Mascots===
[[Image:420logo.gif|thumb| TCC-Tan.]]
*'''TCC-Tan''' is the main official Mascot 420chan. Created in [[Something Awful]] forums, she was placed as 420chan's Mascot after getting permission from the original Artist that created her. TCC-Tan perfectly fits the 420 theme for her looks and her tools such as her giant green bong.
{{quote|Hay Guys|TCC-Tan}}  


[[Image:Yakui_78.jpg|thumb| Drug addicted Maid Yakui.]]
*'''Yakui''' is a Druggy Maid meme created in [[2chan|some wapanese image board]]. Yakui, [[Engrish|being all heavy addicted to medicines ,pills, and hallucinogen,]], is very popular in 420chan and was considered as a sub-mascot by the users. In time her popularity earned Yakui her own board section on 420chan as /Yakui/. Currently the section has been missing along with other sections that once existed such as /bridget/, /Hentai/, /Loli/, etc. Rumors has been out that the Yakui section will return when Kirtaner adds the new sections which he delays on purpose since he feeds on babies.


*'''JigglyPuff''' is considered as an official 2nd mascot. While /b/ was in a Sharpnel Rave Mode, there was an Image of JigglyPuff with glow rings. Many claim that JigglyPuff is the DJ of 420chan's /b/.


[[Image:JigglyWigglyPuff_78.PNG|thumb| A Typical Image of JigglyWigglyPuff.]]
*'''Jiggly Wiggly Puff''' is a horribly drawn MS paint version of JigglyPuff done by Z-IIDX. Mostly seen on /b/, was first seen as a OP image in a Xmas Sticky while a horrible background music was being played in /b/. Since then there has been some new images of Jiggly Wiggly every now and then. JigglyWiggly is known to have a weak bladder since many images show it urinating on the ground or objects/people. Jiggly Wiggly Puff is considered a minor sub-mascot but greatly loved by Kirtaner and Sparto. RIP jigglywiggly 5-3-08


[[Image:Bikko_78.jpg|thumb| Bikko is more awesome than you.]]
*'''Bikko''' is a one legged amputee girl who is popular among some 420channers. Created by some artist in japan, she is considered as a mascot of the /smoke/ section since she is a heavy smoker. [[Some argue]] that Bikko should get her own section, /Bikko/. 


*'''Flonne''' is considered as "The [[Loli]]" of 420chan. A obvious symbol that yells "Etna_Is_My_Wife" is not welcomed here. In some websites that Kirtaner is registered in, Kirt uses a Flonne Avatar. Flonne is a character from Disgaea.


*'''Randy Orton''' See [[Buttsechs|Pro-wrestling]].
[[Image:Morningshowa.jpg|thumb| Default template for the Morning Show]]

===Memes and Text-Memes===

*'''[[Dicks everywhere|DICKS EVERYWHERE]]''', Originally created in 2007 by kirtaner as a Automated response whenever you post an image in any section without any text, it was accepted quickly by its users. From time to time you might spot a user posting an Image VERY RELATED. If you see anyone outside 420chan posting "DICKS EVERYWHERE" then clearly they are faggots that need to get back to 420chan.


*'''I vote you keep on trying''', was originally created as a counter reply to a [[Lucky Star]] Troll in /animu/. Every time the troll would reply, users would say "I vote you keep on trying", in an attempt to show him that the troll is made of pointless and [[fail]]. However now the [[Lucky Star]] Troll of /animu/ uses it himself as a troll weapon against others. The user who first came up with "I vote you keep on trying" [[an_hero|committed suicide]] when he noticed the troll is was using it now, lets just say there won't be any more new JigglyWiggly Puff content.


*'''Lenny is that you?''', Infamously created in /flash/. Whenever someone posts like they have no hands, its usually replied with "Lenny is that you?". There was once a thread in /b/ with OP posting a random picture claiming he was Lenny, followed by other users posting other pictures saying they were Lenny. To this day "Lenny is that you?" isn't used much at all and is mostly rejected by users in /flash/, but- Wait, Lenny are you reading this?


*'''Morning Show''' was originally posted in 420chan's /b/ by a poster who'd found it on Google Images during an unrelated search, and asked /b/ if anyone knew what the hell was going on in the pic. The answer was provided in minutes (in the form of a [[YouTube]] link to a Japanese morning talk show) but more importantly, users began using the default template (pictured), putting their own text in the black and pink boxes. While infrequently used, it is still a 420chan /b/ original.

===tl;dr?===
420chan is the most [[lame|chill]] of the chans. But due to everyone being underage smokers and self-taught wikipedia scientists; facepalms, rage and loss of hope in humanity are to be expected.

===The Chanese Federation===
[[Image:Chanese_Federation_official_flag.gif|thumb|right|]]
420chan has indeed joined [[The Chanese Federation]] recently. In fact, it is one of four founding states along with [[2chan]] state, [[4chan]] state, and [[7chan]] state. [[Some argue|One anon]] who's against the union doesn't mean all 420chan residents are. Seriously, what's wrong with having your own country?

And [[The Chanese Federation]] is indeed a [[lie|real country]]! It's even on a map.

=== 7channers troll /weed/ and mods ===
One day some [[Trolls|7channers]] decide it might be amusing to raid 420chan's /weed/. Since /weed/ is full of [[Faggots|quality posters]] and [[Stoners|awesome people]], this only compounded the lulz through their [[RAGE|intelligent retorts]] and [[BAWWW|disconcerting disapproval]]. For [[Epic fail|2 hours]],  /weed/ was bombed with [[Win|bloody vaginas, dead jews, and gay furry porn]]. Suddenly, 2 hours later, [[Kirtaner]] wakes up, throws on his dress and decides to check up on 420chan, to find /weed/ plastered with the shit. He [[Lulz|RAGES]] at his mods for being so [[Stoner|incompetent]] while [[feem|some people]] try to suck Kirt's dick in a likely effort to [[I did it for the lulz|increase his rage]] and simultaneously [[Pussy|avoid it]].

====Exodus to 7chan====
The site goes down for a couple of weeks in January 2009. After returning in February, it soon became apparent that the recent [[FBI attention|user interface upgrade]] also meant a dozen new moderators were hired, most of them underage. Those oldfags who had remained as part of the IRC community up and left for [[7chan]].

The superiority trolls go forth with renewed zeal.

===Aftermath===
{{main|420chan/logs}}
A sticky goes up on 7chan involving the matter, and much [[lulz]] is had by all. Suddenly, [[Cunt|Sparto]] appears on 7chan IRC demanding that the mods remove the sticky, or at least go on a banning spree, [[Hypocrite|then rages when they refuse and tells them all what shitty mods they are]]. Kirt shortly follows suit and is trolled for a bit, though is sadly [[Bad|not as easy to troll as]] [[Cunt|Sparto]]. The [[User talk:eapoe|raid leader]] then reveals himself to Kirt in what could be considered a well-played coup de grace.

Suddenly [[Anti-lulz|Eman]] decides that to preserve [[Shit nobody cares about|7chan and 420chan's long-standing good relations]] he needs to [[Anti-lulz|ban the raid leader from IRC and 7chan, and delete the thread]]. The raid leader then decides to post in on another chan [[for great justice]] and a thread about it goes up on [[Shit nobody cares about|94chan]], which is then stickied by the admin. An article also goes up on [[http://wikichan.net/Trolling_420chan|Wikichan]]. Hours later, [[Butthurt|the article on wikichan is deleted, and 94chan's bandwidth limit is exceeded]].

==77777777 GET==
[[Image:77777777get.jpg|thumb|[[Shit bricks|Bricks were shat]]]]
In [[at least 100 years ago|(not so) recent news]], 420chan was the subject of the highly contested 77777777 get. In the last moment, a 420channer swooped in triumphantly stealing the coveted get.

This was simply too much for the noble yet less-than-intelligent /b/tards. With the fury of a thousands flies on fly paper, they descended into the depths of 420chan's /b/ in an attempt to steal back the 420chan 333333 and thus, in some existential sense, their honor.

Laaaaawd, did they 4ail. Mods skipped the number and thus the /b/tards went stomping off to demand mom pour them another glass of live wire.

==Selling Out==

Despite being a once great hideout for [[pedos]] and stoners alike to bask in a relatively [[cancer|cancer-free]] and smoke-filled environment, it seems motives for 420chan have changed in recent years. Far from being this once-achieved bit of paradise, Kirt seems to now focus his energies into attracting as many [[newfags]] as possible to the site. This includes the addition of many stupid features, such as party banning, an unlulzy [[Taimapedia|wikipedia]], and a twitter.

He has also become overcome with a terrifying worry that some of his userbase may possibly leave the site with every legitimate criticism voiced on the /420/ - Site Discussion board, and deletes any such posts as soon as he sees them. To test yourself, try posting there that 420chan was in fact not the second site to do away with frames, that 420chan was not the first ever site to have a wiki, or that the real reason most [[irc]] networks enable mode +x is for privacy and security reasons, not just because “[[wat|they are stupid and like to encourage trouble]]”. Best of all, try mentioning that [http://web.archive.org/web/20060613043924/http://img.420chan.org/pedo/ /pedo/ really existed].

All because he has to maximise his userbase as much as possible to make moneys from his crappy little store, and hopefully postpone getting a real job [[permab&|forever]]. Can running a cancer-free *chan mix with being an unemployed broke stoner? The answer it seems, is no.
