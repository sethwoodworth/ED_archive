IGN is a shitty game website, populated by [[basement-dweller| basement-dwellers]], [[furries]], [[Tourneyfag|tourneyfags]], and [[13-year-old boy]] [[trolls]]. It's most well known for its forums, on which hundreds of retards actually ''pay their hard earned money'' to post on their many crappy boards. Their reviews are noteworthy as well, mostly because they are utter shit, with one reviewer even claiming to have played ''[[Halo]]'' for the [[DS]]. Don't forget kids, that you can't spell ignorant, without ''IGN''
== IGN Boards ==

The IGN boards are a mixed bag of shit and piss, but  better than [[GameFAQs|that other site]]. Probably because they hire [[13 year old boys]] to moderate it. 
Users seem to be organized in a hierarchical structure; at the top you have the losers who have been there the longest, or have the most posts. In the middle you have the users who have proven to be valuable members and [[fellatio|helped]] the mods and the higher users in various situations. At the bottom you have the noobs who have a low post count, or just recently registered. This makes IGN one of the [[liar|few]] places on the internet where having no social life makes you cool.
Trolling runs rampant of the boards and, although occasionally lulzy, annoys the hell out of anyone who visits there. This results in users [[butthurt|complaining]] to the mods and getting other users banned, which then causes riots because [[homosexuality|someones]] favorite user won't be posting for a while (this usually causes users to commit suicide). 

And so, this brings us to teh Vesti.

On IGN, all [[Unwarranted Self Importance|the cool kids]] hang out on teh vestibule (known for trolling threads, polls about the most ridiculous subjects, fags preaching about their religious beliefs, bragging about the sex they've never had, and posting pictures of their "GF's" who don't even know them, only to have them photoshopped into unfunny situations). teh Vesti (you have to spell it that way because they're cool like that) is mostly filled with Homos, Jews, Niggers, Nerds, Furries, Elitists and Fucktards. This means that if everyone on the Vesti died, there's a 99.9% the world would instantly be a better place. Most posters like to make up bullshit stories about how they had sex or get into some kind of sticky situation, when in actuality, they are all just virgins and stay home all day, and create alternate accounts so they can post stupid shit without fear of getting their main account banned. The worst of these alts are the gimmick users who are so lonely they have to become a new character on some message board so they can get the much wanted attention no one gave them when they were younger. 
To their credit, [[bullshit|teh Vesti is one of the only places on the internet where a hot girl may actually think about posting]], when this happens the faggots of the Vestibule come flocking and start posting stupid shit and try their best to get recognized by the opposite sex, whether it be by sucking up, or by calling her ugly, or by just being an creepy furry. 
Other boards IGN features include [[shit nobody cares about|....]]

== Bannable Offenses ==

It should be noted that on IGN, you can be banned for ''everything''! If you swear you'll get banned, if you post inappropriate pictures you'll get banned, and if you piss off the mods during their consistent periods, you'll get banned.

This is the full list;

- Flaming & Bashing
        
- Pornography & Sexually Explicit Content
   
- Pedophilia
           
- Other Explicit Content
            
- Posting "Real Life" Information
            
- Racism/Hate
       
- Trolling
            
- Profanity
           
- Criminal Activity
       
- Spam
         
- Circumventing a Ban
       
- Copyrighted Material

- System Wars

- Advertising & Solicitation

- Piracy, ROMs, and Warez
       
- Impersonating Other Users / Accessing Another User's Account
     
- Altering Board Code
       
- Off-Topic Posts
      
- Spoilers
            
- Posting Huge Images / Fake Signature Pics
    
- Questionable Content

Some of these are understandable (pedophilia, racism, altering board code), but some are straight up Nazist, e.g. posting huge images. Seriously? I can get banned for posting an image that's too big?

==IGN Video==

IGN is full of shitty video content that often takes a fucking lifetime to load. In the time it takes to load a single 320x240 pixel video, you can take a shit, [[Basement-dweller|take your monthly shower]], and take a shit again. Even the [[retarded|bad ass]] [[Basement-dweller|insiders]] experience shitty download speeds. IGN could take their revenues and invest them in their new servers to handle the increase in traffic, but don't, [[some argue]] because they know that [[true|99% of their visitors are jobless basement dwellers who have too much fucking time on their hands anyway.]]
IGN also desires to go the contrary of the YouTube route and litter their video service with commercials so that shitty download speed can be even shittier and users can be flodded with pointless OTHER commercials when they are just trying to watch a commercial for a CERTAIN video game!


== Summary ==
[[File:IGN Imagine Party Babyz Mafia II.jpg|right|thumb|300px|IGN believe ''Imagine: Party Babyz'' is a great game and better than ''Mafia II''. No seriously they do, check it out on their site if not sure.]]

IGN sucks. After reading this article, [http://boards.ign.com/ make a fake account there and spam the shit out of it].

Bonus points if you can get them to buy insider for you.

Also, in case you haven't heard: [[Halo 3]].
