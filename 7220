'''San Diego''' is a city in [[california|Mexifornia]] that's full of [[beaner|mexicans]] and related shit. San Diego is best known for the Mexicans occupying every 6 square feet of the land, [[Comics|Comic Con]], illegal immigrants, homosexuals, and [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|being on fire]].

===Location===
It is located in the [[US]] state of [[California]] just north of the border with Arby's.

===History Behind the Name===
Found by the [[Native Americans]] [[at least 100 years ago]], they named the city Kumeyaay, which means the land of no rain, wild fires, and [[lesbians]]. Later, but still over 100 years ago, the [[Mexicans]] would make the trip to Kumeyaay to trade with the [[Indians]]. They would load up their goat with bags of tequila and by the time they got there, the Mexicans and their goat was all covered with dirt and sand. Lois and Clark got to this place during one of these trading parties and they ordered everyone to shut up. Then they told the Indians to open up gambling/strip joints (now called casinos), and they told the Mexicans to get the fuck out, you and your "Sandy Goat." N.B. If you are a dumb fuck [[clown]], after someone says San Diego, you say "A Whale's Vagina."

===Politics===
The city is politically located deep inside the [[Arnold_Schwarzenegger|Governator's]] anus, and it is where filthy [[beaners]] and [[economy|OMG DEBT DEBT DEBT]] really shine. Mexicans come here because they still think that this slice of California is still part of their shitty country because they haven't worked out the concept of annexation from [[at least 100]] years ago. [[Incest|We're a big happy family.]]

===People===

'''Women''' come in two flavors: a plastic blonde Barbie with wrinkles, or a 3 foot tall Mexican burrito-ball pumping out 3 kids a week.

'''Men''' are either [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Scooby_Doo_Raped_By_Shaggy.jpg Shaggy from Scooby-Doo], or a pack of Pedros gathered together near the Home Depot to mow your lawn.

===Economy===
[[Image:Swastikabuilding.jpg|thumb|San Diego Ã¼ber alles!]] The [[Jews|Tourism, Metal Lathering, and Pornography Industrial Complex]] is responsible for employing over 40% of San Diego's residents.  The rest either work illegally, are employed by the military, or both.

Apparently every aspect in the city necessary to human survival is [[Hurrchan|HURR]] BROKE NO MONAIS, and the San Diegan media only feature [[butthurt|drama laden complaining about the state's budget and news reports of other people complaining about the state's budget]]. As a result, everyone is in a collective [[OMG|shitfit]] to figure out [[Mexico|where all of that money is going.]]

San Diego is the world's largest importer of silicone breast implants. It is also a successful platform for making the [[Mexican]] populace millionaires through [[welfare]].

==Education==
[[Image:Stdsu.jpg|thumb|SDSU girls spreading their diseases]] San Diego State University ([[Gay|USD]], [[In the ass|SDSU]], [[STFU]], [[Goatse|UCSD]], [[ROFL]]) is basically a day care center for wannabe [[Los Angeles]]' criminals and other assorted [[b|societal scum]]. There is actually a 65% infection rate of herpes among the SDSU school populace, not including other STDs commonly found in the virus incubators known as 'women' here. USD educates future housewives and middle managers.

'''[[College|Palomar Community College]]''' is where Mexicans and failures go so they can say they went to college and not have to feel like a high school dropout. The professors are about as efficient in their teaching as a [[13 year old|12 year old]] [[autism|autistic]] with a [[retard|speech-impediment]] and wooden limbs, while the students are worthless unmotivated potheads either protesting [[bullshit|deep statements]] with a [[Bible|dysotopian novel]] in their hand or masturbating to Obama with their own poorly-contrived [[USI|political beliefs]]. Everyone there fiddles around with their parents' expensive [[Apple|Macbook]] to play [[WoW]] or [[fap|pretends to study]]. '''IT'S LIKE I'M ACTUALLY IN A REAL COLLEGE!'''

==Places to Go==


*'''Carlsbad''': [[White]] [[yuppies]] pretending to be surfers and black person [[vegetarians]] live here. Sometimes hosts a village fair filled with [[republican|right-nut]] Christian conservatives. Anyone who lives here will brag to outsiders that they live next door to [[sk8ter|MOTHERFUCKING TONY HAWK, BRA]].

*'''Clairemont''': The lower-middle class white suburbs on Mission Bay. Home to the biggest douchebags in San Diego County and some shitty theme park that's full of [[Lego|dildo-shaped plastic blocks]].

*'''Downtown''': Where all the tall buildings, [[baseball|Petco Park]], and [[mall|Horton Plaza]] is. Niggas and scene kids go to horton to shoplift from the Nordstrom. And where nerds from all over the world come every summer to go to [[Comics|Comic Con]] at the Convention Center.

*'''[[teh|El]] [[box|Cajon]]''': (Not to be confused with El Cajon Blvd, where all the [[prostitutes]] are) Just a few liquor stores away from being a full on ghetto. Everyone here is either stoned or drunk and they all [[h8]] each other. It doesn't help that the temperature's always [[at least 100]] degrees.

*'''Escondildo''': Actually has a larger population than Denver, but the US Census bureau states "133,000" - the other 700,000 undocumented aliens are not included in the official tally.

*'''Failbrook''': Faggotry drug-filled beaner town trying to at like a farming village, filled with scene kids and poser gangsters. Has good weed though.

*'''[[Brokeback Mountain|Hillcrest]]''': San Fransisco's retarded incestuous shemale brother. They keep the place pretty clean, that is however in exchange for buttsex tax.

*'''La Jolla''': Downtown LJ is home to Jews; Blacks is home to billionaires and real drug dealers; UTC is home to Mormons, and UCSD, home to San Diego's asian population.

*'''Mission Beach''': A 2 mile piece of sand littered with condos, tourists, bums, a shitty roller coaster and The Wave House, which is a place where some genius decided to build a man-made surfing wave (neglecting to consider the pacific ocean was only 30 meters away).

*'''Mission Valley''': [[Shit nobody cares about|Has some shitty stadium that's home to some shitty team that plays some shitty sport.]] 

*'''North park''': Capital of the [[Hipsters]] - the streets are full of metrosexual [[hipster]] faggots riding fixed gear bicycles and having anal sex with each other while drinking some obscure microbrew you've never heard of.

*'''Ocean Beach''': Hippies, weed, hemp clothing, little kids with fucked up names like Celestial Rainbow, homeless people, homeless dogs, and cash only pubs. It's basically Venice Beach with a vagina. 

*'''Pacific Beach''': Full of frat fags and sorority sluts that can't afford to live Downtown. Also, party buses, cocaine, STDs, bums, and bars. Once upon a time you could drink on the beach, and it would throw one helluva 4th of July, but there was too much titties and lulz so the cops took it away. 

*'''Point Loma'''(PL): The armpit of San Diego. Being 1 mile west of the airport, there is a constant ear-bleading drone of jets 24/7. Poseur [[hipsters]] fill the streets of this overrated shitsville, so count on being berated with the scent of clove cigarettes and cheap booze when in the Pee-L. 

*'''San Marcos''': This is where a lot of our tax dollars go to support lazy [[wetback]] 10+ families. Every Mexican stereotype you could think of is displayed here. The whole place smells of Carl's Jr. and pot.

*'''[[Windows Vista|Vista]]''': There is nothing there. Nothing. A movie theater... A shitty waterpark... Oh, and [[Beaner|beaners]]. Not to mention "Vista" is [[Microsoft|Spanish]] for [[BSOD|view]]. There's no view. And not to mention a shitty operating system as named after this city. Fail.
