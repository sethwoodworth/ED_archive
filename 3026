Forced anon
'''Forced Anon''', otherwise known as Forced Anonymity was, up until recently, mandatory on 4chan unless of course you were [[moot|really special]], but names came back in April 2008, due to [[fags|popular demand]].

<b>Fake Anon</b> is a relatively recent form of [[newfag|newfaggotry]] spreading throughout [[4chan]], particularly [[r9k]], involving physically typing out your name as <b>"[[Anonymous]]"</b>, thereby more or less prostituting the entire idea of [[lies|anonymous as a group]] to the end of [[attention whore|attention]], like the [[incest|sister you've never really known]]. This can even be followed by tripcode; for example, Anonymous #DISREGARDTHATISUCKCOCKS. It is generally synonymous with whining tl;dr posts about personal experiences that should really just fuck off back to [[somethingawful|SA]] where someone might care.
