The Legend of Razor
{{stub}}

'''''The Legend of Razor''''' is a [[webcomic|mature comic with mature themes]]. The original [[sauce]] is currently unknown, leading some to believe that the comics are all done by an elaborate [[troll]]. At any rate, the comics are a great source of unintentional [[lulz]] and fulljoy.

The manga follows "Razor", a bizarre [[13-year-old boy]]'s [[fursona]] from a Homer Simpson sprite. Razor escapes from some sort of lab, apparently, and while the details of what happened between issues #3 though #43 are unknown, somewhere along the way Razor lost weight and got involved with Inuyasha, various Sonic characters, and the Teen Titans. Needless to say, the few comics [[Anonymous]] was able to procure are brilliant.
