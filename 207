Acfan
A [[vandal]] who stirred up [[drama]] and [[lulz]] on the [[GameFAQs]] for ''[[Animal Crossing]]: Wild World''.

[[Last Thursday]], acfan2006 offered to give away the rare item Metroid to the five users who had pulled the most amusing [[prank]]s in game. The thread was quickly swarmed with posts about the funniest things users had probably never done. Three were quickly chosen to receive the gifts. Then - horrors! - acfan hacked their games, putting museums in front of their gates, making it impossible for them to play online!

The forum quickly exploded into mass chaos, and several people quickly [[Quitting IRC forever|quit ''Animal Crossing'' FOREVER]]. The [[drama bomb]] spread to other ''Animal Crossing'' related forums, with some people claiming it was fake, others providing pictures, and others claiming [http://forums.nintendo.com/nintendo/board/message?board.id=animal_crossing_ww&message.id=313530#M313530 their lives had been ruined]. 

Aftershocks are still being felt throughtout the dumber part of the AC community, and only time will tell if they can learn to trust again. In the meantime, they cope by writing hilariously bad [[fanfic|fanfics]].

==The Horror! The Horror!==

No. So u have no proof. Its the same here, I can't prove it does not exist but since u can't prove that it does, then it does not."
**"By ruining their games, he has wasted their life."
**"In the span of a few hours there have already been at least two different reported cases of people doing this, and I have no doubt that soon there will be more. Because, well [[stupid]]ity spreads."
**"Protecting your game, probably.. but to protect you?? It isn't like they can come through the DS screen and strangle you to death O_O; Or can they..."
**"This is really something. You used to think you could trust anyone, but this happens."
