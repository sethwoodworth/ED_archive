ICQ
[[Image:Icq.png|thumb|Looking to cruise tonight, young [[homosexual]]?]]

[[ICQ]] is the [[old meme]] of [[AOL Instant Messenger|instant messenger]] systems.  An ugly, unwieldly program, it was inundated with [[spam]] and later bought and put out of its misery by [[AOL]].  Today, the only people who use ICQ are [[Quasidan]], [[mediacrat]], [[homosexual]] [[13 year old boys]] looking for [[sex]], and [[emo]] kids looking for old high school friends to cry about.

==ICQ basics==

* ICQ is an attempt at [[leet]]speak, as it stands for "I Seek You."  Amazingly enough, ICQ's creators are [[not]] [[homosexuals]].

* ICQ, as a basic tenet, did not, and still doesn't, rely on [[screen name]]s, but, rather, a series of numbers.  One of the reasons it failed is because [[16 year old girls]] have a hard enough time remembering their 10 digit phone number, let alone a 14 digit ICQ number.

* ICQ has the single worst interface in the universe.  See the image to the right.

* ICQ can also be known as a "multiplayer [[notepad]]"

* ICQ also hosts the gayest IRC chatrooms in the whole world.

==Eye Seek Drama==

[[Drama]]?  On ICQ?  No one frigging uses ICQ anymore.  If you want to try, you could comment on how you still have a 6 or 7 seven digit number from the mid-1990s, but, as known, no one fucking cares.
