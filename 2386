[[Fursona|Fursonas]] come in all shapes, sizes, and species. You have obese raccoons whose only goal it is to become fatter, foxes who want nothing more out of life than to get fucked up the ass by every species on the planet, and [[Prince Jeremy|otters who aspire to be great authors of our era]]. Sadly, these constitute as little more than [[typical|"run-of-the-mill"]] for the furry community, as the extremes that exist within their vile ranks make the standard furry seem almost acceptable by comparison.

He lurks in the darkness of the dA forums, seeking out his prey. With a taste for trolls, he leaps from the shadows and into the spotlight, becoming the center of attention wherever his hunt may take him. His fursona is so oddly specific, there could not possibly be a pack or tribe of his kind: ''[[What|He is a werewolf version of Canadian actor John Candy]], trapped inside the body of a supposedly 40 year old [[aspie]].''

Welcome to the world of '''Nathan Forester''' ''(AKA '''DrMusic2''')''; a [[:File:Ihappentobeawerejohncandy.jpg|self-declared]] "natural born werejohncandy".


__TOC__

==[[Autistic|Artistic]] Endeavors==
Like most tartlets with [[No life|plenty of time to spare]], Nathan has a substantial body of work behind him. He has posted a minimum of three "stories" per day - as well as a varying number of "photomanips" sporadically over the course of a week - since he first registered his [http://drmusic2-1.deviantart.com/ deviantART account] in July of [[2009]]. Yet, despite this body of work and the time he has spent on deviantART, he has only managed to amass 39 followers as of May 7th, 2010. Of course, this fact hasn't slowed Nathan down at all, as he has multiple submissions filed under literally every submission category deviantART has to offer. Now '''THAT'S''' [[retarded|dedication]].

<u><center>Unsurprisingly, there isn't a single decent or salvageable piece in his entire gallery.</center></u>

===Written Works===
[[File:Transformation_Trauma_by_DrMusic2_1.jpg|thumb|130px|right|Fanart of Nathan in his [[Hilarious|dreaded]] "weregrinch" form. Just kidding. He has no fans]]
[[File:Weregrinch by DrMusic2 1.jpg|thumb|130px|right|You wouldn't like him when he's angry!]]

{{quote|My monster world character is named Nathan Talbut who is a weregrinch, his nicknames are Nate and The Grinchman. His monster nickname is Growler.|Excerpt from [http://drmusic2-1.deviantart.com/art/Monster-world-me-162653074|"Monster world me"]}}

A large bulk of his writing deals with his [[Personal army|imaginary army]] of [[furbies|imaginary monsters]], whom he sends after his real e-enemies to exact his "revenge" upon them. In their off-time, they'll [[Real Life Super Heroes|fight imaginary crimes offline]], hang out in an [[hugbox|imaginary bar]] which caters exclusively to [[furries|imaginary monsters]], or [[Gay|hide in their imaginary closets]] ''(Nathan apparently does not understand the connotations that come with doing so)''.

Outside of his "Monster" series, he also pens a series by the title of "Tales From the Web" ''(Which serves more direct call-outs of his online enemies)'' and a number of one-off stories. They are childish at best, and unsettling at worst. To think that any one person could devote so much time to producing stories and still be such a poor writer is a baffling prospect, especially when it is taken into account that his choice of subject matter is more becoming to the works of a 4th grader than a 40 year old.

To read through the entirety of his written works would take more time to spare than anyone should care to calculate, let alone spend. To legitimately enjoy his writing would take the mental state of a thoroughly tasteless toddler.

His art, however, is far more convenient to flip through, and elicits far more [[lulz]] from the [[you|viewer]]. The majority of his artistic submissions are simply [[MSPaint]]ed pictures of his werejohncandy [[fursona]], touching upon every variety of [[sex positions|suggestive pose]]. Never mind the fact that John Candy was never much of "a looker" in real life: Slap a heap of fur onto his face and make him strut his stuff, and it's nearly enough to make you [[Tubgirl|vomit in your mouth]]. Remember folks: ''This is how Nathan imagines himself as what he "really looks like", trapped inside his shell of a human body''.

His visual deviations will occasionally deviate from his so-called "norm". He hosts rather large photograph galleries, [http://drmusic2-1.deviantart.com/gallery/#_browse/traditional/bodyart of his "friend" made up in various face-paints] and [http://drmusic2-1.deviantart.com/gallery/#_browse/artisan his collection of children's plushies]. He's drawn a number of [http://drmusic2-1.deviantart.com/gallery/#_browse/anthro celebrities in their animal forms], and [http://drmusic2-1.deviantart.com/gallery/#_browse/gameart concept art for his upcoming video game] [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Millitary_Koalas_the_game_by_DrMusic2_1.jpg Military Koalas: Marsupial Squadron]. He's even paid tribute to the late [[Michael Jackson|"King of Pop"]] himself, [[:File:Enterprise_MJ_by_DrMusic2_1.jpg|as a redshirt from Star Trek]].

Putting aside his [[Copypasta|repetition]] of themes and characters in his works, there's plenty to be laughed at within his gallery. From the utterly ironic to the hilariously inept, nearly every picture in his gallery is amusing in its own right. All that's left for him to do is post some proper [[Rule 34]] of himself, and he will have officially dabbled in every genre of art officially recognized by the Internet. However, until that day, there are still enough lulz to last a lifetime on his page right now.

{{quote|Did I mention i also have connections with the mafia?|Nathan, on the comments of [http://dcqc.metokur.org/2010/03/21/month-in-review-march-2010/ "Month in Review: March 2010"]}}

[[File:Raccoonbywerekatt.jpg|thumb|right|A photomanip [[no|worth fighting for]], according to Nathan.]]

A project run by a group better known for [[METOKUR|their YouTube commentaries]], DCQC is designed to troll tartlets with terminal cases of [[USI]]. The concept of fair use eludes their targets, and they cannot grasp the concept that someone has the legal right to review and mock their "art" under the [http://www.metokur.org/devart/legality/ fair use exception] to copyright laws. After commenting on [http://werekatt.deviantart.com/art/Raccoon-12212967 a laughable photomanip of a girl as a raccoon] as part of [http://dcqc.metokur.org/2009/07/16/raccoons/ a larger article about raccoon art in general], Nathan discovered the page and left a series of [[butthurt|disapproving comments]]. It turned out that the picture was the work of a friend of his, and that he was committed to having the article taken down. After a failed attempt at [http://forum.deviantart.com/community/rips/1443279/ convincing the dA staff to get involved], and having temporarily hijacked [http://forum.deviantart.com/community/rips/1439813/ another tartlet's complaint thread] in order to rally users against DCQC ''(as well as further promote his friend's artwork)'', Nathan began to comment on other articles on the page, and to fight other tartlet's battles for them.

[[File:Drmusic2_dcqccap.jpg|thumb|left|The beginning of a beautiful [[User:Habermann|friendship]].]]

Nathan's comments teach a valuable lesson in [[irony]], as well as the inability of [[aspies]] to realize when they're being trolled. When called out on being a shameless promoter for his friend and a creepy furry, Nathan responded by announcing that he was ''"actually a pretty nice guy"''. He would later "prove" this point by boasting that ''"a lot of [his] friends, and [his] family think [he is] a nice person"'', and that he has ''"donated to numerous charities"''. When it was later pointed out that he could not go a single comment without shoe-horning in an obnoxious number of irrelevant pop culture references, he stated that he is ''"quite an avid reader – [[Shit nobody cares about|[he has] not only all of Roger [Ebert]’s film books but [he] also [has] read Bruce Campbell’s autobiography If Chins Could Kill as well as Make Love The Bruce Campbell Way, [he] also thoroughly enjoyed Jay Leno’s book Leading With My Chin]]."''

Numerous trolls and tartlets alike have begun to [[flamewar|argue]] with Nathan on the comments of the articles, in the hopes of getting him to confess more lulzy secrets and leave more laughable quotes. Recent posters have taken to imitating Nathan, and causing him to [[rage]] about his ''"identity being stolen"''. As DCQC exists entirely to attract complaints, they have yet to [[stfu|"silence him"]], and don't have plans to. So long as this is the case, Nathan will likely continue to [[troll bait|comment]].

[[File:Drmusic2sasc.jpg|thumb|right|Nathan attempts to have a [[srs]] debate about how to kill the imaginary monster he invented, before going on to compare [[ED]] to [[Perez Hilton]].]]

A decidedly obscure blog by the name of Slapstick Anarchy reviewed a piece written by Nathan entitled [http://drmusic2-1.deviantart.com/art/I-love-Werejohncandyism-151681967 "I love Werejohncandyism"], under the assumption it was an elaborate joke. When Nathan came to defend his honor, however, the author soon found that he was indeed [[batshit insane|legitimate]]. Overnight, rents' blog which had previously had no more than a comment on any of it's previous articles found itself knee-deep in walls of text, posted by none other than the werejohncandy himself.

Noting the success of her first entry, rents would later write two companion pieces, including an in-depth explanation of [http://slapstickanarchy.com/?p=877 the anatomy of a werejohncandy], and a public service announcement detailing [http://slapstickanarchy.com/?p=895 how to slay a werejohncandy]. Nathan, in all his childish stupidity, mistook these joke articles for legitimate guides, and argued that rents had "got it all wrong", completely oblivious to the fact that nobody in the world takes the concept of his fursona seriously besides himself. He would enter [[tl;dr|pages-long]] back-and-forth debates with the webmaster, whom apparently had nothing better to do than to argue with an [[CWC|autistic 40-year-old men]] who believe they are [[Twilight|werewolf actors]] trapped inside human bodies.

[[File:Werejohncandyggro_s2.jpg|thumb|165px|right|The legacy of [[Shit|fine art]] Nathan is now leaving behind him.]]

Overnight, following this article going live and [http://www.metokur.org/devart/2010/05/07/nathan-f-on-encyclopedia-dramatica/ DCQC announcing it] on their page, Nathan decided to ''swap out his fursona in a desperate attempt to avoid being trolled''. Whole-heartedly believing that by announcing he was one species of imaginary monster instead of some other form of imaginary monster, that [[Unrealistic expectations|the Internet might leave him alone]], completely oblivious to the fact that his claiming to be '''ANY BREED''' of imaginary monster is warranting of continued trolling.

Never mind the absolutely retarded idea that Nathan [[srsly]] believes - now that he is a "weregrinch" - that he is beyond mockery: The fact that he is now feverishly denying ''ever having been a werejohncandy'' is perhaps candidate for the single most absurd "turn on a dime" ever performed by a victim in the history of documented trolling. Since the day he joined dA, he had been claiming to be a [[Retarded|"natural born werejohncandy"]]. One sleepless night later, and his page now boldly claims that he is ''and has always been'' a [[Retarded|"natural born weregrinch"]]. How you can be "naturally born" as one species, and then claim the next minute you were "born" some other species is beyond me. Not even [[Transgender|trannies]] deny that they were born as either a male or female before deciding to make the change.


'''Evidence confirming Nathan's past as a werejohncandy:'''

*[[DrMusic2/The benefits of being a werejc|"The benefits of being a werejc"]]
*[[DrMusic2/Werejohncandy tf guide|"Werejohncandy tf guide"]]

*[[DrMusic2/The_life_of_a_werejohncandy|"The life of a werejohncandy"]]


It can be concluded from these so-called "stories" that Nathan did, at point in time, believe he was "born a werejohncandy." The reason for his deciding he no longer wishes to affiliate with his made-up species of make-believe monster is that he legitimately believes in his made-up monsters, and legitimately believes that his made-up weregrinches are beyond real mockery. Unfortunately for him, his monsters ''aren't'' real, and the Internet doesn't take kindly to [[Furries|sick fucks who have given up on humanity and wish instead that they were born as animals]]. As such, even as he pretends to be his new weregrinch fursona, he will still be subject to mockery, as he rightfully should be.

==Continued Trolling==
[[File:Sasquatch_by_DrMusic2_1.jpg|thumb|right|Take care not to confuse the Sasquatch with [[Trolldin|a proper troll]].]]

Trolling Nathan is just about as easy as can be, and keeping his continued attention is as simple as not giving into his demands: If he wants you to take down a copy of one of his pictures, rehost it on as many image-hosting services as you can and send the URLs to him. If he wants you to leave his friends alone, harass them until they leave deviantART. Whatever you do, [[Ondore|don't believe his lies]], and don't let him convince you that he's a "nice guy" ''([[aspies]] are subhuman, and are incapable of emotion)''.

If you're too stupid to figure out on your own how to piss off a furry, here are some helpful tips you can use to pretend you're a troll:
*Suggest that a werewolf version of John Candy is a stupid fursona to have
*Suggest that a werewolf version of Jim Carrey as the Grinch is a stupid fursona to have
*Remind him that John Candy died of a [[HNG|heart attack]] at age 43, and that Nathan "doesn't have much time left!"
*Remind him that Jim Carrey is a talentless hack, and that the live action Grinch movie sucked
*Tell him [[truth|Steve Martin is better than Jim Carrey]]
*Say you like Were(insert another dead comedian)s better!
*[[Troll|Critique]] his art, and watch him accuse you of [[flaming]] regardless of how legitimate your criticisms are
*Make fun of his supposed friends
*Make fun of his supposed friends' pictures
*Remind him that online acquaintances are not real friends
*Remind him that only children believe in imaginary monsters 
*Accuse him of being gay
*Accuse him of being egotistical
*Accuse him of shamelessly promoting for his supposed friends
*Any or all of the above, but on a site that isn't deviantART that he can't delete your entries on ''(Or have [[Moderator|someone else]] do it for him)''.
*Tell him he is violating copyright law.
