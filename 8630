PERIOD."]]'''|industry=[[Script kiddie|Hacking on Skittles]], spamming [[4chan]]|products=[[lulz]], [[drama]] and [[troll bait]]|homepage=[http://www.u413.com U413.com]}}

'''U413''' is a super seekret underground elite [[tree fort|hacking club]] in the depths of the [[Internets]] ran by a [[faggot]] [[basement dweller|coder]] known as [[user:Unh4nd13d|Chevex]] aka [[Alex Ford]]. You could say that it is filled with many skilled [[hackers]] who are so [[leet]] that they use the forum just like [[fat|Linux users]] use a terminal, but in reality it's a bunch of [[Fat|13 year old]] [[elitists]] posting on a badly-designed forum thinking that they are good with a [[computer]]. This is because the layout and style of U413 is to [[copypasta|mimic]] old [[shit|dial-up]] BBS boards, so everything can only be accessed by typing shit in. You can't click on anything to navigate rendering modern technology useless on this board.

The furthest the average user on U413 has gotten programming-wise is downloading [[Visual Basic]].
==U413 False Front-End==
Because Chevex was so afraid of the horror that the interwebz wrought on his secret forum and his life, he recently decided to hide U413 behind a fake front-end to deter the trolls from getting in. If you go to U413 you will be redirected to Chevtek.com, his company site. The entrance to U413 is hidden on this page. It's like having a furniture business as the entrance to your mafia hideout; except the mafia consists of little faggot wannabe hackers instead of badass thugs.

Getting In
*'''1.''' - First click on the small radioactive icon in the bottom right corner.
*'''2.''' - Now click on the picture of Chevex himself. He turns into a flaming PIrate when you do.
*'''3.''' - Finally click on the "Request Quote" link toward the bottom of the page. You will then be redirected to the U413 command line.

Note: You still need invites to get in, even if you make it past the shitty front-end. Once you have a username and your IP is logged you don't have to use the secret entrance from that IP.

==U413 Forums==

[[image:U413-flamewar2.PNG|thumb|right|Typical U413 flamewar]]
[[image:Theygotnorton.png|thumb|right|[[I GOT NORTON!|They got Norton!]]]]
The forums of U413 are filled with a bunch of egotistical teens, mostly the kind who get picked on at [[school]]/[[college]] because they prefer spending their time browsing a web 1.0 board instead of being [[irl]] social. The average user on the forums refers to themselves as a "[[anti-lulz|blackhat]]", and has downloaded every tool off hackforums.net to a folder somewhere, which does lead to flame wars where [[Script kiddie|skiddies]] call other [[fucktards|skiddies]] [[retards|skiddies]] and vice versa. Threads on U413 normally consist of topics such as "How do I unblock U413 at school???" and "How to use [[Proxy|atunnel]]?".
Foreign characters do not work on the forum, even though they do have a foreign board which hardly anyone posts in. Although, this does help get rid of [[Spics]] and the [[Wapanese]].

The only reason to be above 18 on U413 is if you're a [[loser|pedophile]] or a pathetic [[pedophile|loser]].

Beware if you become a [[moderator]]! Chevex will demod you at random (especially if you are a cry baby) and with no explanation as to why. (Not that this is really a bad thing, as being a mod on U413 is the equivalent of babysitting a playpen full of three-year-olds with [[ADHD]] and [[Retard|cerebral palsy]].)

===Normal Boards===
These boards are available for anyone who has an account on U413.
*'''General''' - This is where ramblings are posted, usually where Chevex begs and pleads for monies.
*'''Gaming & Sports''' - This is where players post about [[v/|vidya]] gaems such as [[Runescape|Roonscayp]] and [[Halo|Gaylo]].
*'''TV & Movies''' - Mostly about [[Star Wars]] and [[South Park]], or anything that can be watched online since U413 users don't watch TV.
*'''Music & Audio''' - [[Justin Bieber]] galore.
*'''Books & Literature''' - [[Lie|Because books are so 1337]]
*'''Art & Photography''' - Full of Desktop and [[Pi]] manipulation threads.
*'''Programming & Software''' - Where users go to get their guides on how to repartition [[XP]] or to get information on how to hack Facebook accounts. It's cracking, not hacking. '''FUCKING ''IDIOT'''''.
*'''Religion, Philosophy, & Paranormal''' - A massive shitstorm board, filled with either "[[Atheist]]s get in here" or "[[Christian]]s get in here" threads. 
*'''NSFW''' - Filled with [[furfags]] and [[rule 34]] of forum members.
*'''Site Stuff''' - "''[[No|Add in a better GUI please!!]]''"
*'''Foreign''' - lightly moderated because the mods [[America|can't speak any other language than their own]]
*'''Link Requests''' - Use this board to ask for links to [[Furry|yiff]] porn you accidentally deleted.

===Secret Boards===
There are a few boards on U413 that are not listed on the main list. These are all secret boards and nobody is actually allowed to tell others about them. [[Lulz|Oops, lol]]. These are: 
*'''-1''' - Where users attempt to [[divide by zero]] by putting folders into their subfolders.
*'''42''' - Unused due to users having [[Second Life|no life]].
*'''117''' - A fucking ''[[Halo]]'' board since the site's owner is a [[loser|Halo fan]]. Here all the threads rotate around [[SNCA|Halo Reach and other titles made by Bungie]]. 13-year-old [[Half-Life 2|Source]] [[fantards|fanboys]] lurk this board to claim Halo is [[gay]], however.
*'''420''' - Where the [[San Andreas Roleplay|cool kids]] state how cool they are for smoking cool weed.
*'''666''' - Where Chevex promotes his love for satanism.
*'''1337''' - A board for 1337 h4x0rs who bitch when people like [[you]] find your way onto the board.
*'''9001''' - It's [[Old meme|over 9,000]]! This is where all the [[over 9,000|old meme]] spouters on the board go on a daily basis. The random board of u413.
*'''12345''' - The Wheel, where Chevex talks about how much he sits at home playing online poker.


To access these boards, one must type "b" and then the board number.

===Secret Commands===
[[Image:U413-youarebanned.png|thumb|right|fuck you]]
These commands pretty much do fuck-all whatsoever and are just here for reference. You don't actually have to log in to do these.
<!-->Filtered comments are those that the owner keeps fucking around with</!-->
<!-->*'''^^vv<><>BA''' - Turns the site into the fucking Matrix.</!-->
*'''bsod''' - Simulates a BSOD, although you can still [[doing it wrong|see the site under it]]. Requires you to be logged in.
*'''cosmos''' - Gives you [http://youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc this video]. Requires you to be logged in.
*'''4chan or /b/''' - Displays [[Boxxy]] along with a lameass video.
*'''fuck you''' - Instant [[ban]].
*'''LL or [[luelinks]]''' - [[LUEshi]] image followed by the same video.
*'''pi''' or '''3.14''' -  An image of pi appears accompanied by fitting music. It's like Chevex has a [[fetish]] for this shit.
*'''ED''' - An image macro of the twin towers being bombed for the lulz and a video of Chevex reading this page during what sounds like a rainstorm.
*'''login''', then '''joshua''' - [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLJ3zcdPtl8 SHALL WE PLAY A GAME?] (figure out the rest)

===Secret Chat Commands===
*'''/laioni''' - forces you to misspell things just like the user Laioni.
*'''/fiskie''' - in honor of ED and Chevex's favorite ED author.
[[Image:U413chat.png|thumb|right|[[WHEN I WAS]] chatting on u413]]

===[[Wordfilter|Word Filters]]===
Word filters no longer exist in U413 Chat Channels.

[[image:Typicalu413thread.PNG|left|thumb|[[Irony|101, j00 gu153 n33d t0 g3t l41d!!!11]]]]

The entrance code for U413 was originally leaked on [[b/|/b/]]. The code was the number [[pi]] backwards to 510 digits, so after fucking around and typing in every digit backwards, [[b/tards|/b/tards]] immediately started to sign up on U413, causing only mild disruption throughout the site because noone could figure out how to operate the piss-poor navigation on there. After finding a quite a bit of [[Goatse]] copypasta'd onto his board from users of /b/, Chevex, the site's owner, decided to make sure the site could only be accessed with invite codes. Because half of /b/ couldn't actually figure out how to use this death trap in the first place, it gave the users of U413 a dose of [[USI]], knowing they were smarter for their clever use of an obsolete BBS.

Because of U413's [[Spam|mass-recruiting]] scheme, U413 is filled with a ton of fucking /b/tards who are still attending secondary school. People who spammed the 4chan boards were promoted to moderators for bringing so much attention to the site. Since the 7th of May 2010, invites to the site were closed, and users had to submit $20 to the Jew to let other people get into the site.

If you ever go onto this board, you'll find that everyone on there follows the same superiority complex, e.g. ''L0L W3 SM4RT3R TH4N TH3M B3C4US3 W3 C0P13D 4ND P4ST3D 4N 1NV1T3 C0D3 T0 S1GN UP!!111''. Even the owner itself thinks this, stating the board is ''0π133 f0r t3h 1337''. The other argument they share is that U413 is just "[[true|/b/ with invites]]". Although, any threads about 4chan, /b/ or cancer will get a poster an instant ban.

===The Average U413 user===
[[image:U413-asl.png|thumb|right|The average U413 user is an elitist teen.]]
U413 users on average follow the same traits, such as:
*Tri-booting [[Linux|Oobantoe]], [[Windows|Winblows]] and [[OSX|OSsuX]].
*Being [[13 year old boy|13 years of age]]. There is a constant thread going on where people ask how to unblock the site at ''school''.
*Still browsing [[b/|/b/]].
*Being a fan of [[Halo]].
*Being a [[furry]]. If not, [[otherkin]].
*Using ''Game Maker'' to code. ''"I didn't use [[C++]] because of Reason X",'' Reason X being the [[Lie|cover-up]] as to secretly not knowing C++.
*Being ''completely fucking obsessed'' with the number [[π]].
If you fall under at least four of these, you may as well join, then you can tell all your friends at [[school]] how much of a cool [[loser|hacker]] you really are!

==U413 IRC==

|im a newb and dont know how to use this, halp|U413 users on [[IRC]]
|}}</center>

U413's Unofficial [[IRC]] was created by it's members so they could congregate to spam 4chan's /b/ with forced memes so they can be [[funny]]. The discussion in IRC is usually about which OS is better or what board to spam next. This IRC is also Chevex's personal [[hugbox]], in case he needs somewhere to cry after being successfully doxed on /g/ again. Whenever Chevex appears on IRC, it normally ends up with his members bowing down to him as they treat him as some sort of [[god]] (''[[Nobody Cares|OMG ITS CHEVEX HIMSELF!!!]]''), resulting in many U413ers sucking up to him in an attempt to get admin. Strangely, Chevex thinks that it would be more appropiate to integrate a chat room on his command-line /b/oard than have a flexible IRC channel, and soon plans to [[divide by 0|replace the IRC channel]] with this feature.

U413 members actually have no idea how to use their own IRC, including Chevex himself. Examples include banning people via nicks instead of hostmasks and not knowing where the fuck [[ED IRC]] is located, despite it being linked on at least a thousand articles across ED.

'''''BREAKING NEWS!!!''''': We just found out why he wants to move: U413's IRC channel is on [[DALnet]]. Well it ''was'', but Chevex soon got word from Helldive IRCop Deviance. The IRCop educated Chevex about IRC and how DALnet is just a festering pit at the end of the internet, and thus #u413 is now on Helldive under the control of [[neckbeard|Deviance]] although the channel is still quickly cancering up the place.

===Dday for #U413===
'''On May 29th, 2010''' EZBake and the CHAT_INTELLIGENCE_AGENCY had enough of the cancer that #u413 on Helldive was dishing out. So they infiltrated their chat, and bombed them with epic botfloods for days. There were heavy casualties. And the survivors were sniped off by Operator Deviance sealing off the channel for good.

===#U413's return===
Since they have nowhere else to go, #U413 is now cancering up Rizon IRC. U413 now has chat rooms integrated on the site, although almost nobody uses them.

==@U413.com==
[[Image:U413Emails2.png|thumb|right|The original thread]]
Recently, Chevex set up email accounts for U413. You can now get a @U413.com email address! ...for '''$50 a year'''. This was part of Chevex's Jewish plan to coax as much money from the 13-year-olds on the board as possible, but his plan soon failed as they were all too poor to cover the cost, or just didn't know how to get onto mom's PayPal. On the other hand, the forum members were too [[fucktard]]ed to know what bandwidth was. Even still, other users were sad enough to actually buy one of these, or at least have thoughts about it. In fact, the original thread was a shitstorm for the first few posts, with Chevex finally stepping in and trying to calm everyone the fuck down, eventually everyone submitting to Chevex's sudden reappearance, giving in and spamming his PayPal with monies.

<center>{{Morphquote|everyonelovesemails|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;
|Lol... 50 dollars? I'll stick to [[Google|gmail]], thanks.|hereno

|$50? You really must be desperate.|Cipher
|LOL! 50 bucks!? he gets these for free..... i can understand maybe 5-10 bucks... but seriously? 50? lol.|brandon420
|}}</center>

==U413 vs. LUELinks==
[[image:Unh4nd13d USI.png|thumb|right|Chevex getting told]]

Some of U413's userbase came from [[LUELinks]] (moar liek JEWLinks, [[amirite]]?) aka [http://endoftheinter.net The End of the Internet], which is some other invite-only site that <del>[[nobody cares]] about</del> every faggot and their brother wants an [http://www.google.com/#&q=%22luelinks%22+OR+%22endoftheinter.net%22+invite invite] to. Chevex soon stole [[LUELinks]]'s idea of having an invite-only forum and reworded his excuse on [[LUElinks|LUELinks's]] forums. Since Chevex made U413, he became increasingly [[butthurt]] when members of [[LUELinks]] personally attacked him in flame wars, making him retreat back to his board. If it wasn't for each site's lockdown schemas, both sites would be in an endless war right now.

==U413 vs. 4chan==
[[image:U413banned.jpg|right|thumb|[[CSIII]] is too advanced for U413.]]
{{Quote|we are the [[internet hate machine]].. 
but u413 is the people hate machine!!
|A /b/tard on U413.}}
Since the original entrance code was leaked, the site's owner Chevex thought, "spam this site all over 4chan? What a brilliant idea!" and started getting his members to flood 4chan's boards with the same topics over and over, claiming that U413 was an underground 1337 community. Soon after, U413 was filled with gullible [[b/tards|/b/tards]], increasing the ego of the 14-year-old veterans on the board. Members then started to complain about the spam and rejection they got in retaliation, making them wonder why they ever went onto 4chan in the first place.

More and more threads made their way onto 4chan, mostly on the /b/, /g/ and /x/ boards. [[x/|/x/]], being gullible as usual, went and signed up to U413 without any questions asked. /g/ and /b/ however were quite hostile towards these unwelcome [[newfags|newcomers]], quickly saging the threads and trying to get rid of this newfounded [[cancer]]. In fact, 4chan isn't the only forum that was raided by U413; a quick Google search reveals their attention whoring on forums at [[Newgrounds]], [[Runescape|Moparscape]], [[Flash|Armor Games]] and [[YouTube]]. Yeah, [[No|that will make sure the userbase is kept clean of morons]].

After hundreds of the same fucking threads, [[Anon]]s from /g/ stepped forward while /b/ were running in circles, finally telling U413's owner to [[STFU]] followed by quickly raiding the Internets for his personal info and posting it all over U413-related threads and on U413 itself, resulting in [[bans]] getting handed out everywhere. Quickly after this, Chevex stopped his invitation schemes in the hope that Anon wouldn't rape him any further.

==U413 vs. ED==
[[image:U413Editwar.png|thumb|right|The original edit war]]
Alex found his site's ED article after [[Google|Google Alerts]] told him about his great new article (he has it set to alert him for his nickname), resulting in massive butthurt as he then ended up posting a sticky in his forum asking for an [[Personal Army|army]] to be formed to take down his personal information off this article. Because they were new to the Internets, the members of U413 quickly fell for his personal request, and started vandalising this page until it was locked by ED sysops. Chevex then declared [[war]] on ED sysop [[Lmte]] because he was reverting every shitty edit they did. This soon led to a shitfest in U413's IRC plus plans being made in U413's forum for future vandalisms of the site.

A long time later, Chevex locked the original thread after realising that editing a revertable article doesn't work, thus contacted his [[Lawyer]] and went on with a [[lolsuit]] instead in an attempt to get his information off ED, which was personal information he publicly left on the Internets in the first place. '''[[TL;DR]]''': Chevex is a [[moron]].

|Looks like the war has begun between U413 and ED user lmte|Chevex, declaring war against [[Lmte]] for reverting his vandalism
|Now we should all go to lmte's user page and insult him...........many times and in many ways.|Chevex
|The lock expires May 19th. We'll just have to keep this up and rally everyone to rape it again on that day.|Chevex
|come on! surely we know some l33t h4xx0rs that can get through the lock? or hack an admin account?|fridaysdust, realising the [[shit|true power of U413]]
|Can't access the site for some reason. Some sort of error. Mission Accomplished?!|[[No|Yes]]

==Chevex telling it like it is==
In an attempt to be [[funny]], Chevex uploaded a video to YouTube in which he reads the article on U413. Subsequently he went and put it on the U413 ED article. End result, a 10 minute video in which he skips out the good parts. Chevex is too egoistical about his ED pages proving he never knows when he's [[GET OUT|not wanted]].

'''[[Protip]]''': Turn on closed captions for added lulz.

==U413: The new [[Hackers on Steroids]]==
[[Image:Omg1337hax.png|thumb|left|[[Fox News|THEY WILL STEAL YOUR CREDIT CARDS WITH THEIR MAD HACKING SKILLS]]!!11]]
[[Image:SamcursedSP.jpg|thumb|left|Apparently if Sam_Cursed was on South Park she would look a [[mac]]fag [[emo]] Arab with an attention whoring fashion sense.]]
[[image:Wereusingthemanyway.png|thumb|right|Yes, but that doesn't stop us distributing free invites.]]
[[image:MeanwhileonEDF.png|thumb|right|MEANWHILE ON [[EDF]] we proceed to misunderstand [[RMS|the meaning of the word "FREE"]]]]
In July 2010 Chevex started his invite scheme again after finding his super seekret forum was becoming as dead as [[Anontalk]]. At first the invite page was accessible by anyone. One of the many trolls who lurk this page every day warned Chevex that a link to the invite page was on U413's ED article. At first he made links to the page from [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] redirect back and forth, and when that was averted he removed the page completely and invites could only be accessed by the sites INVITES command.

Regardless, ED's very own troll [[circlejerk]] gives out these invites to those on [[ED Forums]].

It should also be noted that even though Chevex "doesn't give a shit about ED or /b/" he checks this page at least once every day, usually more. Now ''that's'' commitment, perhaps even obsession.

Some of their other members will plan to hack your credit cards if you troll their site and make them mad. This will actually never happen because most of them are [[retarded]] and never heard of [[sock]]s and [[Tor]] (unless you actually give them your details). So, beware of '''Sam_Cursed''', who will totally rape you and hack into your bank account with her [[Autism|apparently high IQ of 156]] and [[emo|tough life]].

(in reality, she is [http://www.youtube.com/user/ihatedisney666 a mediocre guitar soloist].)

U413 is ran by '''Chevex''', aka 23-year-old Alex Ford, a super-successful bachelor/entrepreneur who literally [[bel air|turned his sad life upside down]]. After finding the website [[so ronery|SuccessfulBachelor.com]] was available, he snapped it up, [[fatty|lost weight]], became [[rich and beautiful|fabulously wealthy and now enjoys life every day]]. Alex is living [[so cash|so large]] he only works four hours a week and spends the rest of his time playing [[online poker]] and [[Halo]]. In fact, he has became so successful, he has begun to teach others about his [[Fellatio|great skills]].

He used to go by '''Unh4nd13d''' on U413, he changed it presumably to attempt to escape the [[BAWWW|emotional distress]] that the ED article has so cruelly inflicted upon him.
