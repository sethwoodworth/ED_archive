In July [[2010]], Old Spice's ad company introduced a new [[Billy Mays|pitchman]] to shill its [[DO NOT WANT|unappealing aftershave]]. '''Old Spice Man''' (better known to [[Anon]] as '''Old Spice Guy''') joined a long line of [[unfunny|quirky]] characters like [[SNL|Will Ferrell]] in the [[viral]] [[forced meme|ad campaign]]. Little did they realise what they had on their hands and that Old Spice Guy would actually get people paying attention to your grandfather's [[neckbeard|aftershave]] of choice and rocket the character to [[e-fame]] and [[OC|create]] a bona fide [[internet famous|Internets superstar]]. Played by ex-[[NFL]] player '''Isaiah Mustafa''', Old Spice Guy [[is now a meme]] and is beloved by [[Anonymous]].

The Old Spice Guy is the man [[you]] could smell like if you used Old Spice. (or took showers). He is the pinnacle of manliness and an example of what every [[4chan|channer]] should [[LINK MAH BOI|strive for]] in their lives. He has a {{yt|oldspice|YT Channel}}, in which he replies to various [[Youtube Nobodies|YouTubers]], [[twitards]] and other [[reddit|assorted denizens]] of the [[Internets]] giving advice on [[The Comprehensive Guide To Life|how they can be better people]] and filling /[[r]]/s for things like [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-fLV28SkZ8 proposing marriage] on behalf of some fag with an [[imaginary girlfriend]].

==Re: Anonymous==
On July 13, 2010, Old Spice Guy became the 147th [[Peter|King of /b/]] for his response to some /b/tard, which shows how easy it is to [[Social Engineering|manipulate]] [[Anonymous]].

After finding the video, [[Anonymous]] went crazy with joy. They started spamming the comments with [[memes]], declaring the new king of /b/, saying that everyone is a newfag, you know, [[Fail|the usual]].
{{morphquote|oldspice|background-color: transparent; width: 70%; height: 200px;|font-weight: bold;
|Black Old Spice guy is a [[pretty cool guy]]. eH maeks youtube videos and doesnt afraid of anythin|[[Newfag]]
|Oh Old Spice Guy...you had me at [[Delicious﻿ Cæk]]. If I was gay, I'd totally give you a [[Brofist]]ing.|[[ODB]]
|So we'll troll him -because he can take it. Because we [[lie|don't fawn over him]]. He's a﻿ silent, manly, guardian -watchful, appealingly scented to women, protector. A [[Dark Knight]] of /b/|Anon
|OLD SPICE UNDERSTANDS ANON :') this is a beautiful moment.|[[Anon]]
|He is the only man to have won The Game, and lived to tell about it. He is the only man to play Russian roulette with six bullets and win. He is the only man to stare down Chuck Norris, and survive his roundhouse kick. When he speaks,diamonds are born. He is, [[Dos Equis|the most interesting man in the﻿ world.]]| [[Anon]]
|Goddamnit. We need to kill this whole thing now.|[[Arguecat|Why we can't have nice things.]]
|by holding up random things he is probably referring to /b/. the cake was probably a [[NO U|coincidence]].|[[Anon]] is [[DOING IT WRONG]]
}}

==Clarification==
The Old Spice Guy indeed was referring to [[b/|/b/]] and [[4chan]] in the video, as clarified by the Old Spice Guy himself. Since the vidya description was subsequently changed to the current [[harbl]], many [[newfaggots]] started doubting OSG's sincerity and insider knowledge into the workings of the [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE]] and crying about [[Rules 1 & 2]] -something he had already covered in the original vidya description, addressing the Rule 1 & 2 (which is supposed to only apply to teh [[rAIDS]]) faggotry.

{{quote|Dearest Anonymous,

I gladly accept your nomination and hope my reign as your 147th king will be long and full of win! Thank you for your continued support!

Love,
The Old Spice Man|OSG}}
Wait, 147th? [[Old Spice Guy#Re: Anonymous|Where have I heard that before?]]

===The Stunning [[Implications]]===
[[File:Old-Spice-Guy-Every-thing-is-now-diamonds.jpg|thumb|[[Bling]]]]
Whilst it is doubtful that an [[aspirations|aspiring]] actor would know anything about [[Anon]] and [[ROTI|their ways]] and is just reading from a script prepared by some [[NORP]] copywriter from an [[forced memes|advertising company]], there are disturbing implications in this whole lulzfest. That implication? That a [[btard|/b/tard]] has found gainful employment. Even moar disturbing is the thought that since many [[Anon]]s and [[channers]] are now all growed up and entering the workforce, [[Project Mayhem]] is in effect. 

{{quote|Lol at Old Spice's ad﻿ firm having a /[[b]]/tard as a copywriter. Anon is going into the workforce now. Anon is now old enough to [[Project Mayhem|cook your﻿ meals, haul your trash, connect your calls, drive your ambulances, guard you while you sleep]]...and write copy for Old Spice apparently. [[Project Mayhem]] is GO GO GO.| [[Anon]]}}

===Old Spice Guy Calls It Quits===
On 14th July 2010, Old Spice Guy retired from making vidyas is a [[emo|tearful]] farewell YouTube to finally [[GTFO]] that fucking bathroom he'd been in for two weeks solid to attend to [[IRL|moar pressing matters]]. He immediately headed down the the Gulf of Mexico, donned a SCUBA tank and SWAN DIVED! into the [[Deepwater Horizon]] oil leak after BP's months of hard [[FAIL]]. 
<br>
<br>
<center><youtube>nFDqvKtPgZo</youtube></center>
<br>
<br>
Next up for Old Spice Guy will be teaming up with this month's other famous retiree -[[Paul the Psychic Octopus]]- to fix the [[G20|broken global economy]], get comprehensive [[wetbacks|immigration]] reform, win the war in Afghanistan, achieve [[Freedom Flotilla|peace in the Middle East]] and [[SEND JUSTIN BIEBER TO NORTH KOREA|delivering Justin Bieber]] to [[Kim Jong Il]] in exchange for all their nukes -all the stuff [[Obama]] is supposed to be doing but can't because of [[no friends|non-existant bipartisanship]] in Washington DC. Old Spice Guy's ability to make friends and influence people will make all this a cinch. Old Spice Guy is your [[Black Jesus]] now. 

He will then take a short holiday during which he mod every board on [[4chan]] and pitch 2 perfect games for the [[New York Yankees]] whilst batting .500 with 10 home runs in the [[2010]] World Series. He will be replaced on YouTube by [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI Double Rainbow Guy].

==Old Old Spice Guy==
[[Unfunny|Tim and Eric]] directed a few commercials preceding the new old spice guy. He is very angry and like all of [[Tim and Eric]]'s work, [[retarded]]. Also, at 1:58 we see conclusive evidence that [[Jews did WTC|Terry Crews did WTC.]]
