[[image:Promise_july19.jpg|thumb|GRIPPING DRAMA]][[File:Haiguys unstrappd.jpg|thumb|right|Exhibit A-]][http://www.socialspin.com Unstrapp'd]is a Youtube  [[Serious_Business|"reality show"]] where eight retarded Ex NRU[http://www.nouveauriche.com/] [[camwhores|grifters]] (all but one claims to have have left their [[Imaginary girlfriend|girlfriends]]) have decided that videos of them making hamburgers and getting their hair done will somehow produce a $100,000,000 social media enterprise.   The "entrepreneurs" have turned a San Clemente, CA McMansion into a rooming house for the ethically challenged as they fleece cripples, primp, and bully local businesses into accepting [[Girl_Drama|publicity]] instead of cash in exchange for their services.[http://socialspin.com/who-we-are/] 

The show's principals are the executives and employees of "Social Spin" a newly minted [[social_networking|media services]] company that [[IRL_troll|packages and sells stuff that's already free.]]  Most of them met at Nouveau Riche University and are associates of [[Casey_Serin|Casey Serin]] The World's Most Hated Blogger. A related company "Social Media Altitude" claims to produce [[bullshit|something]], but it is unclear what.  There is a third project line "SalesTube" which is a classic multi-level marketing scam.  The grifters  market educational videos that coach clients in marketing videos and establishing  "video coaching" businesses.  None of the parties involved seem to have actual business experience, so the priority is placed on [[lemonparty|team building]] exercises and excursions.  As everyone is a big picture [[lazy|ideas guy]], the meetings become an ass-pyramid  [http://www.asspyramid.com] of delegation until someone is paid a bonus to complete their basic work function.



== Origin ==
[[File:Scam alert lol.jpg|center]]
[[Image:griftingdouchebags.jpg|thumb|We look innocent enough, lulz.]]
All eight of these [[White_trash|retards]] believe that they developed the idea for [[meatspin|Social Spin]], and that they are the principal figure.  The spaghetti strands of the [[cult|stories]] are too difficult to follow so let's just pick one that's not overly nauseating.  After watching [[over9000|8]] hours of [[Bullshit|MLM]] YouTube videos, [[retarded|inspired]] Eastern Illinois University student Gabe Strom finally realized that he has been prospected.  He eventually realizes that YouTube is free and he can replicate the "business" for nothing.  Instead, like a fuckwit, he buys into some MLM edutainment coaching program/water filter thing.  Unbelievably, he finds even stupider [[douchebags|people]] to join his [[faggotry|down line]] including fellow Western Illinois University derelict Brad Will and Northern Illinois University dimwit Ben Dixon.

== The Fleecing Of The Cripple and [[your_mom|your mom]] ==

Among the people in Ben Dixon's downline was Adam, a paraplegic crippled in a car accident.  Brad and Ben pitched Adam on the UNSTRAPP'D concept during  the 2010 Superbowl.  A week later Brad Will [[ejaculation|embarrassed]] himself on video as he opened a Fedex envelope to reveal a check for $50,000.  Speculation was rife among the tards on the troll board [http://www.campidiot.com/ci/viewtopic.php?id=398300&p=1 Camp Idiot] that the 50 grand represented a substantial chunk of Adam's settlement from his accident.  Within a month of receiving the check Brad, Ben, and Gabe had moved to their rented McMansion in San Clemente.  It seems ridiculous to call Adam's seed money an investment since it produced neither stock nor a position on the board.  It's possible that Adam's check represented a loan to the company, as a promissory note for the value appears in financial documents.  Adam has visited the mansion at least once during which he was seen in the kitchen while a [[dungeons_and_dragons|party]] [[lame|raged]].

'''So, what was the 'big' idea behind [[Fat_whore|Social Spin]]?''' 
[[image:Logo2u.gif]]

Co-created by all or none of them, the idea was to sell blogs to [[Stupid|dumb people]], [[Old_people|old people]], and [[Cripples|disabled people]], charge them money for what can be had for free, scare them with threats of the scarcity of their 'secret info' and all around just being douchey. Their first step was to create more than 100 fake blogs with all the same articles. They believed that this would make them look successful right off the bat (given their target audience of dunces and the uninformed elderly and/or disabled, this may have even worked), as well as provide a way to spam their links all over the web. Currently a [[Drama|power struggle]] rages over the name, as Bradley and Yermal have wrested control of the FBF 'phenomenon' from the clutches of Tubman (or something).

== Social Media meets Antisocial Media ==

Shortly after the appearance of this [[shit|article]] UNSTRAPP'D went into full [[Pwnt|lockdown]] mode.  They demonstrated their social media prowess by locking their twitter and facebook accounts and deleting UNSTRAPP'D episodes, old myspace profiles and anything else they could find lying around the internet.  The end result is that now all their [[stupid|customers]] are left with are pages of broken links.  They promise they are going to retool with a [[facepalm|new vision]].  Standby for Web 2.1a!

==  Chris Record, [[Attention Whore|President]]  ==

[[Image:Chris pose.jpg]] [[Image:chris_record_mom_tipi.jpg|thumb|Chris inside Mom from Dad's (her 2nd husband) online photo album.]][[Image:tasana_camara.jpg|thumb|This is his latest step dad. Mom's on husband number 4.]]
Sun Falcon was born in a teepee to [[cosplay|cosplaying]] [[hippies|hippies]] during a rainbow gathering.  His own [[manboobs|umbilical cord]] attempted to [[rape|strangle]] him, but [[Doing_it_wrong|failed]].  His afterbirth was eaten by coyotes when his father Ron stretched the placenta and umbilical cord to make a plunker.  He may have survived death by umbilical cord, coyote, and embarrassment, but the loss of his spirit [[cock|instrument]] proved to be too much.  Sun Falcon took the white man's name of "Christopher Robin" Record and set out to become a world class [[douchebag|douchebag]]. As retarded as it sounds, it's all true. 

His parents relationship faltered as his father entered the world of the employed, first as a sprout farmer and later as a programmer with [[SCO]].  "Chris" lived with his mother, sticking it to the man by existing on section 8 and food stamps.  Like many children of hippies, his teenage rebellion consisted of returning to the mainstream.  For "Chris" this meant a confused mish-mash of middle class stereotypes culled from TV and old copies of Reader's Digest including the wearing of ties, some kind of hip-hop spray painty street art, entrepreneurship, and an attraction to an ill defined and free form set of vaguely "christian" beliefs; in the sense that Jesus said "Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me, for I would rifle their pockets, for the candy money theirin."

Epic Pwnage, LULZ!

“It was refreshing to see such high-quality [[Computer_Science_3|education]] for entrepreneurs.  We are two very young entrepreneurs who never achieved much success, and we lost what we did achieve.  But with this Real Estate Investment College Program and Mentorship we are now living life beyond our wildest dreams”   -   Chris and [[Daddy's_money_lesbian|Vanessa Torchio]]

== Russell Yermal, Chief Information [[Newbie|Douche]] and Wet-suit Shitter==

[[Image:Russell_yermal.gif]][[Image:yermalclub.jpg|thumb|He's the douche on the right.]]
[[Image:Russell_yermal_idiocy.jpg|thumb|:nelson:]]
[[Image:Yermal cripple.jpg|thumb|a fine student he was]]
Russell Yermal  is a [[Fat_whore|mountainous pile of goo]] from [[Texas]].  He demonstrated his low standards when he nicknamed himself  [[Unwarranted_self_importance|"Success]] Man" shortly after his mother wrote to Ellen Degeneres describing how Russell hadn't eaten in 10 days and was about to be thrown out of his apartment for not paying rent.[http://ellen.warnerbros.com/2009/04/want_to_play_gold_digger_at_yo.php]  Russell has since become a partial success[http://fireyourdiet.com/people/RussellYermal] in the Paleolithic sense of the word; he has accumulated enough adipose tissue to hibernate through the winter.  It's unclear if he has managed to breed yet.[http://thesuccessman.com/]  "Success Man" has had his prowess at driving while inebriated celebrated by the Denton County Police[http://www.campidiot.com/ci/viewtopic.php?pid=2378618#p2378618].  In 2006 they rewarded him with free rent, new jewelry, and a chance to hang out with young people for 500 hours.  Look for Yermal's parents to join the UNSTRAPP'D crew in upcoming episodes as they have recently been evicted for nonpayment of rent, and sued for damages as something had been shitting all over their [[shitty|rented]] doublewide.

== Brad Will, Chief Executive [[Drama_queen|Douche]] ==

[[Image:brad_head.jpg|thumb|I don't actually do anything but jibber jabber.]]
[[Image:Bradley_will.gif]]

----
Brad was dealt a harsh hand in life; Brad was meant to [[fail|surf]], but he was born on the shores of Lake Michigan.  Of course there was always wakeboarding, but wakeboarding was for pussies, and why would G-d have given him such luscious blond locks and such a love of weed if he wasn't meant for great things?  He tried the W-2 scene, but found it difficult to take directions from the man.  So Brad Will knew what to do, cause he's a leader!  "I knew I was going to get let go from my 30K/yr job and I didn't want to let them dictate my [[fapping|schedule]], so I quit, and hooked up with some Real Estate Investors and made 29K in one month.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuDDh104vR4]   Suits... watches... Mercedes..."  Unfortunately that 29k was the last money he made in real estate.  He soon found himself feeling [[raped|hollow]], emotionally drained, and living on dog food. Brad honed his copy writing skills during this period to produce gems like these in his bio: 
"Bradley moved into real estate investment and [[Web_2.0|marketing]] and after a seven month [[doing_it_wrong|struggle]], he replaced his previous years income in one single month. which led his to starting his first [[Basement-dweller|successful]] company."

"Bradley was fascinated by the [[furries|transformation]] and the [[emo|person]] he was becoming and knew this was the path and freedom he was destined for. Since then he has helped over 20 young [[fags|entrepreneurs]] start their first [[butt-rape|businesses]]. He currently is involved in [[bullshit|internet marketing]], [[bullshit|coaching]], [[bullshit|consulting]], and [[faps|speaks]] on occasion."

G-d was moved by his humility, so G-d crushed Adam's spine, so that Adam could send Brad a check from the insurance settlement, so Brad could learn to surf.

== Bill Dully, [[Adult Baby|Adult]] [[pedophile|Supervision]] ==

[[Image:billdullytitle.jpg|thumb|Former UpperDecker toy salesman, now Pyramid Supervisor.]]

Bill Dully combines the [[flamer|rugged]] good looks of a tire tread, with the soothing voice of an asthmatic [[Fucktard|Oscar the Grouch]].  He somehow drifted to the top of Upper Deck trading cards but watched his float away as though carried by moon men.  He ran the company into to the ground by demonstrating his contempt for his customers in a variety of ways; overextending such winning properties as [[Yu-Gi-Oh|Yu-gi-oh]] (pronounced you-gay-ho or Yu-Sick-Fuck, full name Yu-Gi-Ohmygodfuckmyass), angering fantasy league [[furries|aficionados]] with endless bannings and reissues of top priced cards in tournament play, and a complete disregard for quality and customer service [http://www.sportscardforum.com/showthread.php?t=86284].  His epic unemployment streak [http://www.ocregister.com/articles/job-82644-executive-ceos.html] was punctuated by failures in the two surest moneymakers on the internet; dick pills and porn.  Like all of the degenerates on UNSTRAPP'D, Dully maintains a blog [http://billdully.com/] where he flaunts his ignorance via cut and paste articles on topics such as weight loss, health, and picking up [[boys|girls]].  Dully has always been out of his depth, but never more so than when dealing with web 2.0  He seems to believe his authoritative blustering will come across as wisdom and that the kids are interested in 3rd hand stories about golfing with Michael Jordan.  He has no real grasp of the business model, except that the rest of the crew dance like fairies in front of their phones and then money falls out of the twittertubes or something.  He's been voted the most likely housemate to die of sleep apnea for 11 straight episodes and is the oldest [[Ex-Gay|looking]] 40-something man on the internet.

== Arthur "Craigslist Master" Tubman, [[spammer|Chief Marketing Douche]] ==

[[Image:arthurtubman.jpg|thumb|DJ Dipshit]]
[[Image:tubman3.jpg|thumb|DJ Reformed]]


Born in the Ukraine, Arthur has been able to apply his "valuable" "skills" gained as an internet [[Jenkem|addict]] and undocumented [[internet_Asshole|pharmacist]] to a variety of ventures.  After [[Dickhead|he]] successfully ran a College Pro Painters franchise into the ground, he made the logical leap to [[Fagolescence|mortgage broker]] where his ethical lapses, poor business sense, and chemical challenges were not a liability.  As the market for tricking retards into signing mortgage papers became saturated, Tubman transitioned to a "direct sales" business that was devoid of product lines completely.  Somewhere along the line he scraped together the cash for a degree from the diploma mill formerly known as the  American Fashion College of Switzerland [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_InterContinental_University].  Like many poorly socialized gen y types with brain damage from excessive partying, he fancies himself a [[Music#Electronic|trance]] DJ and will play hours of repetitive aural diarrhea stolen from semi talented artists to anyone he can corner.  His major contribution to the UNSTRAPP'D team to date has been placing a Craigslist ad, which he considers an executive function requiring advanced marketing skills.  He owns and operates http://thefreeblogfactory.net. He is one of many to claim himself as the original creator and Founder of Unstrapp'ds "Free Blog Factory". He claims himself as the sole inventor and claims it was Social Spin's only cash generating venture. He claims that Bradley is a tyrant,a thief, and that he unfairly wrested control of FBF from him; given what we know of Bradley, this is all quite believable. Also, Tubby (as he likes to be called) has shown very poor judgement when it comes to posting certain pics online. Some say he is unqualified to [[fap|wash cars]] but consensus is swiftly changing to a belief that he is, indeed, capable of washing a car. If the car was a Lambo, he might even do a good job.

== Ben Dixon, Chief [[Pervert|Houseboy]] ==

[[Image:ben_dixon_partners.jpg|thumb|Ben Douchin' Partners]] A confirmed bachelor. Jesus Christ there's still a few more after this one. WTF are executive returns? Shouldn't 'Capital Partners' actually have some capital? Oh I get it, you hard sell (bs) your 'friends' for the capital. Friends like Adam. This one appears too stupid to live. We'll come back to you.

[[image:Ben_stand_still.jpg]]

== Kyle Garrett, Cinderella 2.0 ==

[[Image:kyle_douche.jpg|thumb|Please ignore my Honda.]]Gyle Karrett piled his car with his library of [[bullshit|inspirational]] books by MLM [[retards|scholars]], until the shocks bottomed out, and he drove across the country in his pumpkin/rice mobile looking for a better life.  With his chiseled physique, [[emo|boyish]] good looks, and his ability to knock out pull ups by the dozens he seemed the manliest of men.  His hot pink girls BMX trials bike however, added just the right edge to inflame the hearts of bi-curious tranny lovers all over the internet.  The other housemates grew fearsomely jealous, and pretended that they didn't know how to edit videos or post links.  They made Kyle stay up late editing UNSTRAPP'D videos and mangling client websites.  But even that didn't slake their jealous rages!  They slipped jabeneros into his hamburgers and pretended he didn't get up on his surf board first, costing him the prize.  They threw his flipcam into the surf, and made him get his chest waxed telling him it would boost pageviews and get him chicks/dudes or whatever it is that he likes.  

But muscley Kyle soldiered on, breaking bi-curious [[tranny]] lovers hearts as he boldly continued to [[fap|produce]] what little work got done around Social Spin, even though he had been living with his Dad and didn't have a pot to piss in, and thus didn't hold an equity position in the [[bullshit|company]].  Oh where is Prince/ss Charming?  When will Kyle get the tweet that says Prince/ss Charming is sending a golden bus ticket so that s/he and Kyle can live together in bliss and endless nights of filthy, gritty lubed up tranny sex?

== John Stippick, Chief [[assclown|Clownsuit]] [[attention_Whore|Model]] ==

[[Image:stippick_proactive.jpg|thumb|Social Tardia Expert]]
Stippick has a highly developed sense of [[Asshat|douchebag]] coastal style.  He think's he's [[Old_spice_guy|Sonny Crockett]], but he looks like a boom grip on Jersey shore.  He has a list of dubious "multimillion" dollar companies that he's been associated with, as well as a [[Cock_Trapper|gold digger]] wife whom he met via on line dating site, DoucheLab.com. For their first date he maxed out his Providian credit card and hired a limo. For date two [[pussywhipped|he]] took his guidette to Hawaii only two weeks after meeting her. Of course, she was smitten.

[[image:John_stippick.jpg]]

== Gaybe Strom, Chief [[Fag_Enabler|Jizz Imbiber]] ==

[[Image:gabe_strom.jpg|thumb|Douche Number 8]][[Image:Gabe salestube dickweed.jpg|thumb|'no refunds']]Gabe Strom is a remarkably poor [[cracker|choice]] to lead anything.  His forgettable personality and generic metrosexual look meant that not even the UNSTRAPP'D crew could be bothered to "feature" him in a video.  His repeated failures in the MLM world and at NRU may be attributable to the fact that no one could remember if he was in the room or not.  He was made Chief Communications Officer because everyone got to be an executive except for Kyle.  His father is the Jew for Trinity Lutheran Church in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. How Gabe rationalizes his scammy/scummy business practices with his religious upbringing and false Christan front is anyone's guess. Gabe now attends Rock Harbor, a place for 'unchurched post-moderns' (aka youthful idiots obsessed with acquiring technological status symbols) a church with a street team, email marketing team, and a huge amphitheatre pulpit with a stage they drive Ferraris out onto. And lo, Jesus wept.

His major contribution is acting as the Wonderbread to the [[Shi'ite|shit]] [[sammich|sandwich]] that is Social Spin. And smoking Tons of Weed, when shit hits the fan bailing and blaming Tubman.


[[image:Gabe_tard_books.jpg]]

== Amber Rose Gallagher, Attention Whore, Whore, Groupie [[Fag_Enabler|Jizz Eater]] ==
Nicknamed [[Slut|'Amberghini']] (further evidence of these tards obsession with material possessions that will be forever out of their reach), this chick totally sucks. literally. She ran Social Media Farmer, which was some retarded-ass [[Shit|shit]] yo. Also she would come to you house and [[Smell_Yo_Dick|clean your house]] naked. for money. no joke. 

Yermal allegedly verbally abused her. She banged every octo-tard (well, probably) at one time or another. She [[Drama|called a cop to escort her]] to Tubbs's house and retrieve an alarm [[Rape_Clock|clock]]. In short; the chick's [[Insane|whack]], son! she has a kid too, or something. That makes her a mompreneur, recognize?
She craves respectful anal.

Picture Below was taken about 5 hours after Tubbs kicked her to the curb, literally! So this Douche Bag Nick Thorsch got a picture for spending his dough on drinks and dinner for this unshaven bitch.

== How to Spot a MLM Tard ==

* Generic Christianity -
All [[gypsies|MLM tards]] believe in a strange version of christianity that blends a complete ignorance of the bible with animism, sympathetic magic, and outright greed.  The fundamental [[Brainwashing|tenet]] appears to be "God would not have blessed others with wealth, if He did not want me to take it from them". 

* Other Peoples Cars(AKA [[loser|Lambo-Leaners]]) -
These [[fucktards|retards]] are incapable of passing a decent ride in the street without posing next to it for a picture like a 12 year old boy who hasn't yet discovered [[NAMBLA|masturbation]].  This would be bad if it were just for the trophy aspect, but these retards use the photos in their own materials, pretending that a stranger's car on the street is evidence of the MLM scammers wealth.  This is an example of the use of talimans and sympathetic magic on the part of these tards. 

[[image:lambo_leaner.jpg]][[image:ben_lambo.jpg]][[image:vanessa_lambo.jpg]]  


* Filming Themselves -
If they are doing anything other than begging, scrounging for food, or calling their parents for another "loan", the [[Asperger's_Syndrome|MLM]] Tard will be filming themselves.  It is important that they do this from locations that imply "success" (see below).  Since these [[idiots|Tard's]] are primarily [[fags|narcissists]], this activity is their most enjoyable form of sexual satisfaction and should be viewed as a form of masturbation.

[[image:Unstrappd_salon.png]]

* Standing in the Middle of the Street -
[[hipsters|MLM people]] spend a lot of time filming themselves.  It is vital that they constantly show their downline how [[fake|successful]] they are.  This is best accomplished by standing in the middle of the street in either a very wealthy neighborhood (to pretend that they can afford to purchase there) or a very picturesque locale (to pretend that they will sink beneath a shady oak with a well thumbed copy of <i>The Praise of Folly</i>.  In fact the most likely follow up to the video will be to go back to scrounging for food in dumpsters.

* Constant Use of Earbuds -
These are used to block out the world, lest it interfere with the creative process.  In the case of the drug addled, it also provides a built in excuse for their inability to follow the simplest of instructions.  Overexposure to earbuds may lead to the delusion that they are a DJ. These fuckers act like a trip to the fuckin' Taco Bell is a [[Not_gay|noteworthy]] event in Social Media History...

* Use of Whiteboards - 
Professors use whiteboards, and are considered experts.  Therefore anyone standing in front of a whiteboard full of indecipherable scribblings is an expert.  One of the many examples of these Tards use of talismans and sympathetic magic.

* Praise yourself with [[sockpuppets]]

* Claim to be rich

== Quotes ==

''' "So they made a few mistakes in their lives, big deal, sounds like you [[EbaumsWorld|ebaumsworlders]] are blowing it way out of proportion, at least they've made they're live 1000x better. Look at you guys, you spend your "days off" (if you're even employed*) sitting on the internet masturbating and looking up dirt against successful people. Maybe you need a real life, because obviously all of you guys are the incompetent fools without an education, a significant other, or a happy live. Next time you criticize someone, look at your own lives because obviously you're not happy in them and you're all obviously just jealous.'''
'''So just move on, everyone has something in their past that they're not proud of, we're human, we make mistakes and we move on. At least these guys have turned into a success story and not one of those losers that spend the rest of their lives in and out of jail. I don't see how you guys should even be proud, it's not that hard to find any of this stuff out, especially since most of the guys have publicized their SUCCESS stories and how it all started and if you guys were literate at all you would realize that they were planning on making Unstapp'd more personal before you started shit, so in all honesty, you've done nothing to hurt these guys. They are on top, and they'll stay on top, especially with the support of fans like me." '''
- A loyal fan of UNSTRAPP'D. (aka 'concerned mom')

''' "I guess the source of my frustration is that here is yet another soul, sucked into the MLM web of constant bullshiting of one bullshitter to another bullshitter in a perpetual daisy-chain of mock feel-goodery, and pretend success, that is shown again and again as just a sad thin veneer that shows the truth when peeled away -- most of these assholes are livin' in a rental, or a family member, and don;t have a pot to piss in of their own, but multi-millions are just around the corner..." '''
- A board relic.

''' "And WTF is up with these tards like Casey and Bradley Will, CEO of Unstrapp'd, Social Spin, Social Media Altitude, LLC, taking fucking pictures and videos of themselves opening and otherwise dicking around with their mail? Do they not realize that everyone in America gets all kinds of mail every fucking day, and opens it, then responds appropriately, without having to make a fucking movie or blog post about it?

''' Key-rist." '''  - Soem Dude


== New Developments ==

Strom and Dixon seemingly went on to shill some kind of 'sales funnel' called Salestube. [http://salestubesite.com] Amongst other crap like 'mastery programs' and 'coaching services'.

Tubman has started blogging about his experiences and his thoughts on some of the Unstrapp'd crew [http://thefreeblogfactory.net], particularly 'Tyrant CEO' Bradley Will, Russell 'Not-Successman' Yermal, the 'vegan marketing guru', and Chris Record, 'douchebag of the year (any year)'. He should be given credit for being 4.5 year clean. He is now Chief Technology Officer for Optimus International, a lame MLM/coaching/guru crap thing operated by San Clemente MLM tard Joe Syverson (who also sells an auto-dialer product...classy).

Will and his bootlicker Yermal have resurrected Free Blog Factory [http://www.freeblogfactory.com], pulling the same crap as always. Yermal, known bisexual, had both odd threats and scatalogical ramblings on his 'About Me' section of his website before Bradley apparently [[Ass_Rape|guru-ed]] him into acting more [[gay|pseudo-professional]].

Vanessa Record (nee Torchio) foaled another cash flow champion into the world. It's name is like, Reston or something. He is supposedly named after Reston VA, which is mostly known for its abandoned whiskey distillery. While Vanessa was struggling through labor alone, Chris was preparing a blog post about getting one million (faked) page views on his site.

Amber 'Amberghini' Rose is still doing every guy she meets.
