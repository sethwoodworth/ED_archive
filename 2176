A '''deletionist''' is one types of troll on [[TOW]] that instead of being banned, is actually embraced with open arms.  A deletionist is basically a cross between a troll and a [[griefer]] on TOW and since TOW is suppsed to be about writing articles, it's pretty obvious what they do.

Deletionists are lower than a common [[vandal]] because vandals at least try to make the site more entertaining whereas deletionists only target the entertaining content on TOW  and deletionists think that all [[9000|2,820,350]] articles on Wikipedia should be merged to one page.

Presumably, deletionists think it makes their e-peen larger as Wikipedia is [[Serious Business]], but the problem is that all TOW users that aren't there evading blocks are assholes and so it's just assholes trolling and griefing other assholes.  The people who actually add content to TOW are a very small number of people.  It may look larger, but like with how [[digg]] articles make it to the front page, it's a small number of people with a lot of accounts.  Examples of content adders are [[PoetGuy]] who is responsible for 100% of their [[bondage]], poetry content and [[Sceptre]] responsible for 100% of the [[Doctor Who]] content, and Jon Awbrey who is responsible for 100% of the gibberishy academic articles with big word that are unreadable without looking half of them up.  Except for a few newbies who will later leave the site, that's 100% of the content adders.  The rest of the site is deletionists.  If it looks like someone is adding content, it's either a sock of one of them or it's someone revising an article until it's in a bad enough state to be deleted.

Notable deletionists include [[Jack Merridew]], [[Dragonfiend]], [[Kelly Martin]], and [[Cyde]]. The most feared deletionist of our time is [[Wikipedia:User:TTN|TTN]], an [[fake editor|editor]] who spends five hours each day [[WikiWar|duking it out]] with bitch-ass [[Stargate]] fans and rabid, unwashed [[Magic|Magic The Gathering]] card floppers defending their [[fandom|hall of lamer articles]] from imminent [[baleet]]ion. Since people appreciate having their work deleted, deletionists [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jack_Merridew&diff=192176121&oldid=191640077 frequently receive accolades] from grateful editors like [[Grawp]] often [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jack_Merridew&diff=192176436&oldid=192176164 many] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jack_Merridew&diff=next&oldid=192176540 times] a day.  

==How Deletionism Works==
#Be a prick
#Find a category you have no clue about
#Find a bunch of articles you don't give a shit about that only a few hundred [[weeaboo]]s even know about
#[[Delete Fucking Everything]]
#When people complain, dismiss their comments, call them [[sockpuppet]]s and [[newfag]]s, and keep deleting shit

==What deletionists live for==
<s>[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3aAN&diff=197851329&oldid=188152670 Think of the children]</s> ([[Oversight]]ed):
{{squote|Dear Wikipedia assholes, I regret to inform you that because of deletionist scum such as Gavin Collins and J Milburn, I am planning to terminate my life. You see, Wikipedia was my life, and these deletionist bastards have ruined and deleted everything that I have worked so very hard to create. I spent over three years contributing to Wikipedia, improving the site, sacrificing grades in school to add to a revolutionary encyclopedia, but because of these low-life dip-shits whom I abhor in every molecule of my body, I have discovered that it was all for nothing. So I end my life, and I hope this will bring the wrath and resentment of the world down upon these deletionist jackasses.|A heart-broken child}}

==Wikipedia hates what it does best==
Wikipedia deletes thousands of articles a day that they consider "cruft".

People who use Wikipedia like to write a lot of "cruft", from mentioning tours that musicians have gone on through to various characters in cartoon shows, computer games or tabletop roleplaying games, it is what Wikipedia does.

Furthermore, it is what Wikipedia does best!

But at the same time, Wikipedia hates that that is what they do best! They want to instead be known for making legitimate, real, articles, however they can never do this right and end up with totally inaccurate articles where they can't even get the dates right.
