Captions
Captions are the little bits of text that accompany an [[image]]. They can be witty, [[funny]], [[fucktard]]ed, [[unfunny]] or downright [[tl;dr]].  [[demotivators|demotivators']] lulz are fueled by captions.

Captions can also be added to text on a webpage. For example, many words in any given article on Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica will show as hyperlinks. Mousing over these words will present a caption text in many browsers, indicating the subject matter of the page that the link points to. Asture users of the ED site will be able to increase the lulz content of the ''current'' article by substituting the caption text for the actual text in the article being read at the time.

An example is as follows:

The [[troll|gentleman]] in question is a [[faggot|upstanding member]] of this [[bullshit|upstanding]] community, and should be [[hugbox|greeted]] [[trolled|accordingly]]
