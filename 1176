[[Image:32423321.jpg|thumb|220px|I FUCKING QUIT.]]

'''Internet Hate Machine''' (or '''IHM''' for short; also known as '''[[Powerword|Brittany Marie Holechko]]''' [[irl]], b. April 6, 1990), not to be confused with the [[chris-chan|TRUE and ORIGINAL]] ''[[Internet Hate Machine]]'', is a 20-year-old bipolar, internet dating, poseur mall[[gothic]] whale of an [[attention whore]] who admits that the [[lonely|internet is all she has]] (besides a home, a bed, food to eat, water supply, ect.) .  She is a former [[Patriotic Nigra]] (kicked out for being a faggot), ex-member of the [[FCTC]], and the <strike>creator</strike> usurper of a [[shit]] [[*chan|imageboard]] known as '''[http://94chan.org/ 94chan.org]'''. [[some argue|Allegedly]], Brittany has been trolling since [[2005]]. This was when she first realized that no one would take her [[serious]]ly, and <strike>dropped out of middle school</strike> was [[fail|kicked out of middle school in 8th grade]] for picking a fight with the dean of the school after she got in trouble for violating the school's dress code by wearing her [[columbine|trenchcoat]].

In addition to obesity and an [[camwhore|obsession with self-photography]], IHM suffers from a common [[Aspergers|disorder that makes her unable to socialize in the real world without fault]]. When she's not busy updating her [[vampirefreaks]] or [[myspace]], she's [[oh noes|threatening others]] with retrieval of their [[dox|personal info]] for [[raids]] by [[Lie|friends she has]] at [[/i/]]. Not to worry though; [[fail|either almost nothing happens or her information is completely inaccurate]]. 

Because of the trauma from her [[BAWWWWW|fucked-up childhood]], IHM is unable to tell the difference between [[friend]]s and [[troll]]s. This leads to her depending on [[Trolls|her internet friends]] for [[hugbox|emotional comfort]], claiming that [[lulz|"everything she's done was done for them."]]

== Early Life and Family ==
[[Image:ihmdisappoint.png|thumb|True story]]

Brittany had a [[bawww|very troubled family life as a youth]]. One day her father was [[I am disappoint|disappoint]] and decided to [[An hero|shoot himself]] [[LOL|right in front of her]]. On top of this, her mother gave her [[AIDS|bipolar disorder]] and her uncle also [[surprise buttsecks|raped]] her. Well, I guess that's one way for your family to show their [[love]] for you. IHM is also a [[Final Solution|middle school dropout]], because kids at school would laugh at her massive amounts of piercings and [[Fat|ninth wonder of the world physique]].

== Lolinternet ==

=== FCTC ===

[[Last Thursday]], Brittany was brought into the [[FCTC]]'s inner circle because she had [[dox]]ed an [[jailbait|underage]] [[furfag]], despite the fact that said furfag [[irony|had trolled circles around her]]. After the novelty of having a [[female]] in a trolling group wore off, and the FCTC got tired of having a cumdumpster groupie around, they decided to ditch her - leaving her [[Dying_alone|cold, naked and defenseless.]]

Brittany also seems to have been caught up in the [[lol|illusion]] of being [[anonymous]], forgetting that part of being anonymous is actually not having your dox posted everywhere.

{{q|but yeah she [[lies|claimed she can hack]] and shit and i asked her to show me something she couldent even do anything simple all she had was a stupid site to pull ip's XD
i was like want me to show you how to ddos? lol she got all excited|AnonymousX on IHM's [[CSIII|l33t]] hacking abilities}}

To further push her [[internet tough guy]] front, IHM likes to [[facepalm|make believe that she's a 1337 hax0r]]. She says she is capable when it comes to HTML/CSS, but fails so hard that she steals myspace layouts and removes all credit from the original author.

[[Image:E9e97ccc-7670-11dc-8daf-ab79c2010682.jpg|thumb|220px|aush0k is a [[fag|BOSS]].]]
IHM has had various little conflicts with irrelevant people, but one long-running fight has been with an [[Australian]] [[script kiddie|hacker]] under the alias '''aush0k''', who's notable for pwning the shit out of 420chan's [[Kirtaner]]. Her running her [[cock]] sucking mouth irritated him to the point where he felt the need to attack. By attack, I mean send a [[SWAT|SWAT team]] to her house on three different occasions, ''from the same police department.'' She can no longer [[chink|order take-away]] from any of her favorite restaurants due to her [[ruination]] tactics being used on herself, forcing her to find other ways to suppress her [[baw|depression]] other than [[obese|excessive eating]]. On top of the daily pizza floods, he filled IHM's modem with [[over 9000|over 900,0]]00,000 rice packets per second, [[DDoS|knocking her offline for a couple of hours]]. Not to mention [[Lol wut|ordering a ton of sand to her house]], which she would later <strike>eat</strike> have shoveled into her [[vagina]]. She would soon attempt to gather aushc0ck's [[powerword|personal information]], and have the authenticity of the info she gathered questioned to this very day due to being a [[whore|worthless obese slut]]. Ironically, her and aush0k at once had an intimate relationship, which was unsurprisingly held over the internet, and felt like a stupid whore when [[YHBT]] had [[Fresh Prince|flip turned her e-mail inbox upside down]].<p>[[Media:Aush0ktrollsihm.wav|(Listen to her heartbreak)]]</p>

=== Notable e-Lovers ===
{{quote|she's more or less told me she tried going after VM, Icky-chan, PaperTriamgles... all of the female trolls because she assumed [[Nice try|the rest would have no choice but to fall for her if she was the only female around]]

[[Image:IHMcameforCWC.jpg|thumb|A [[Chris-chan|challenger]] appears.]]
Like most fat, hideous, [[Basement dweller|basement dwellers]], IHM has been known to do a lot of [[Online dating|online dating]]. Most, if not [[Chris-chan|all of her e-lovers have been trolls]], cheaters, or complete [[faggot]]s. Trolling IHM by pretending to be a lover is a common pastime, and follows a very simple pattern: Tell her [[a cat is fine too|you think she can hack and is "boss,"]] let her develop a high-strung emotional attachment (built on a terrible [[retard|inferiority complex]] that probably has to do with height, loneliness and the ability to set off metal detectors from a distance), and when she gets to the point of trying to be on the phone with you 24/7, tell her to fuck off.  You will receive her [[oh noes|terrible wrath]] of [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|text message spam]] and threatening to get [[anonymous|someone else]] to hack you, and receive such delights as live video feeds of [[emo|wrist-cutting]].  This whole process takes about a day or two, which is also the length of time most can tolerate it for.  The current record is somewhere around 2 weeks, done by someone with an IRL girlfriend to help them.

Here is a [http://oppdis.com/legi0npedia/List_of_IHM%27s_crushes list] of some, but not all of her <strike>e-lovers</strike>[[trolls]].  Ask for their stories!

==== [[Ickeriss69|Ickeriss]] Scandal ====
{{Main|Ickeriss69}}
[[Image:Ickeriss_lol.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ickeriss69|LOOK @ ME IMMA REAL TROLL GUISE!!1!1]]]]

Sometime ago Brittany met a [[Faggot|troll]] called [[Ickeriss69|Ickeriss]]. They both had a lot in common, one being a [[bisexual]] self-proclaimed [[Epin|epin-ween troll]] and the other one being exactly the same but in <s>fe</s>[[male]] form. Due to the fact both thought they were [[Internet_superhero|internet superheros]], they decided to meet up in real life to form [[Do_not_want|overweight, bipolar children with a large amount of]] [[USI]]. After people discovered how low ickeriss's standards were, he decided to fabricate a story about how IHM had tried to [[rape]] him. 

The result of this hideous affair was [[Lulz|LULZY]] yet still saturated in [[fail]]. Ickeriss managed to fuck the [[hambeast]] and yet was too much of a useless [[faggot]] to get any nudes. However, like a true [[failure]] he did manage to have a video of him [[fapping]] released recently this year, so at least we have a bent [[penis|cawk]] to look at. Which is just '''''great'''''.

No matter which of the stories is true, her raping ickeriss or him just being [[desperate]], I think we can all agree that it went [[Shit|as well as can be expected from these two]]. Not only did we not get to [[Ruination|enjoy her nudes]], but we also dont get to see what the offspring of two of the [[Lie|best trolls on the internet]] would look like, or see how long it would take for her to [[An hero|become an hero]] in front of her kids like daddy did for her.

==== The Deliah Sykes Incident ====

IHM had been keeping one of her troll friends around by [[lol wut|blackmailing him]]. That's the [[fail|only way she can keep any of her friends around]], apparently. 

He and a group of friends decided to flame her on 94chan, and she started [[baw|oinking]] that she had an IP address on one of them and that she was going to get [[dox]] with it. The IP belonged to a 15 year old troll. [[slut|IHM]] can be [[trolled]] even by 15 year old girls.

IHM was added on MSN a little later by a male member of the group, who apologized for his friends' rude behavior and offered to give IHM information on the girl who had been trolling her. It was [[shitting dicknipples|love]] at first sight for Brittany, who began saying things like "You're my new buddeh ;3" to her new hipster prey. IHM learned that the girl trolling her was named Deliah Sykes, was fifteen, and went to [[pedobear|Judge Catholic High School]], in Utah. She tried [[epic fail|frantically to dig up information on the girl]], not knowing that the person she was trying to find [[ninja|didn't exist]], the information was all false, and that her new soulmate had been the same person all along. Brittany even paid Intellius.com to try and [[pwned|find a phone number on Deliah Sykes.]]

The young troll, under the guise of the 20 year old man, told IHM that Deliah Sykes was going on stickam to [[baw|cry about being doxed]]. Instead, she [[n00dz|revealed herself]] and told IHM that the whole thing had been a sham. Before leaving and [[lulz|blocking]], all Brittany had to say was "epic".

==== The Josef Saga ====
[[Last thursday]], a former [[emo|DMR]] member/ex-elover named phuxx0r leaked some screenshots of an msn conversation he was having with IHM. In the screenshots, IHM was seen with an androginous-looking, long-haired blond individual. He was later revealed to be a [[pussy|submissive]] faggot named [[Josef Fritzl|Josef Musial]], an emaciated young man from Illinois whom IHM had unsuprisingly met on the internets in September 2009. Josef's sudden inclusion into Brittany's life only further shows that she has a thing for [[Ickeriss69|girly looking, long haired faggots]].

=== ETA ===
Being the e-whore that she is, Brittany at one point, e-dated GhostExodus, the leader of a tightly knit group of skiddies known as the [[lemonparty|Electronik Tribulation Army]]. It has been alleged that she made ghost stoop to such lows as [[faggot|singing on cam]]. However Ghost had just been psyopping Brittany in order to obtain her dox, which he later dropped.

Leader Ghost Exodus is now spending time in [[Prison]] trying not to [[buttsecks|drop the soap]]. "What did he get sentenced for"? you might ask, "Was it for [[DDoS]]ing 94chan that one time"? No, actually it was for [[Lol_Wut|"hacking" an air-conditioner at the hospital he worked at.]]

== Social Networking ==
[[Image:ihmisafaggot.jpg|left|thumb|If vanity is for faggots, then [[Divide by zero|that means....]]]]
The [[Trying too hard|hardest troll]] on the internet must also have [[over 9000|many]] myspaces. IHM does such a good job with these myspaces that she [[dox|drops her first and last name]] there along with her blogs about [[lol wut|being raped on a ferry wheel by an old man after smoking weed]]. IHM's primary myspace homepage also consists of bullshit subtle threats, [[internet|interest and hobbies]], a layout most likely made in the days of Web 1.0, and plenty of [[DO NOT WANT|camwhoring goodness]]. She also uses [[Vampirefreaks]] ('''PREMIUM''') because she's a [[Twitard|fat goth]].

== 94chan ==
{{spoiler|94CHAN NEVER BELONGED TO BRITTANY IN THE FIRST PLACE!}}<br/>

|}

94chan.org is IHM's [[Fail|successful]] attempt at making a chan website and proving to the almighty boss aush0k that she indeed does have [[CSIII|l337 computer skills]]. Contrary to popular belief, 94chan was infact never IHM's website to begin with. The site was originally created by a [[furfag]] whose friend had given IHM server-side access for [[shit no one cares about|reasons unknown]]. It has been alleged though that she broke the site by making one too many [[word filter|wordfilters]] in a vein attempt to outwit her friends who now hate and troll her. Going to the site you'll see a a black page with text claiming that the board's return is inevitable. The board's return has been inevitable since at least July '09, but not quite [[At least 100 years ago|100 years ago]]. Like everything with Brittany, it still is, and was complete [[shit|shit]]. Even when it was open.

{{q|We're back.

=== January 2010 Shitstorm ===
In early 2010, IHM was involved in a [[retarded|heated]] feud with [[User:VanKrause|KrappleGuy]], creator of [[Legi0n]].  Working with IHM's former co-admin on 94chan known as TK, Krapple, [[Ickeriss]], and co. managed to [[lol|gain control of 94chan]].  Pretty epic trolling, huh?  Well, until you consider the fact that Legi0n had to enlist the help of a [[pedophile]] [[furfag]] to "hack" a tiny chan site.  A perfect example of [[fags|trolls]] trolling [[fags|trolls]].

== Patriotic Nigras ==
{{rainbowsmall|FRIZZLE!!!!}}
[[Image:ihmskypebawwwww.jpg|left|thumb|I TOLD YOU I LOVE FRIZZLE! *cries*]]
[[Image:lolyourparentsaredead.png|thumb|god dommot sovot]]
Basically in March of 2009 a PN member named [[Russia|Soviet]] trolled her into believing that he doxed the [[User:FrizzleFry101|PN's leader]] and was going to take over the [[Patriotic Nigras]] with that information. Soviet [[faggot|giggled]] as [[fat|IHM]] cried over her spammed chan that Soviet dropped some [[cp|lulzy images]] that promoted the Soviet Union. IHM [[BAWWWWWW|cried]] for an hour and twenty minutes on [http://lulz-enterprises.789chan.org/ihm.mp3 skype] to [[nobody|some person]] about how she loved Frizzle, Soviet went too far, [[Aush0k]], how [[Truth|calling her a troll is a disgrace to trolls everywhere]], and among other things, threatening to come back as a new IHM, hopefully with a diminished [[over 9000|hundred]]tons of fat.

=== Trolled on Skype again ===
One day in late January 2010, [[Second Life]] user and owner of the 4chan-themed [http://wiki.patrioticnigras.org/wiki/Woodbury Woodbury University] sim, [[Furry|Tizzers Foxchase]], stumbled upon IHM's ED page and proceeded to contact IHM on skype, bitchslap her, and send her back to the kitchen.

[1/23/2010 6:22:19 AM] IHM: LOL HURRR I BASE MY LIFE ON INTERNET<br>
[1/23/2010 6:22:46 AM] IHM: IHM yawns<br>
[1/23/2010 6:24:23 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: You're just some lonely, overweight cunt that shops at hot topic and chases internet trolls because that's the best you can do.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:24:44 AM] IHM: Oh look, more regurgitated carbon copy shit<br>
[1/23/2010 6:24:52 AM] IHM: I'm still waiting for something original/offensive<br>
[1/23/2010 6:25:02 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: LOL you're completely out of material. Good game I win.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:25:30 AM] IHM: Really? Because it looks like you just took words from me, and turned it around.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:25:38 AM] IHM: You're horrible at this.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:26:05 AM] IHM: 'Tizzasters' is quite the name, and it portrays you in your true form<br>
[1/23/2010 6:26:25 AM] IHM: Self destructive, dramatic, whiny, 4chan and SL obsessed<br>
[1/23/2010 6:26:32 AM] IHM: Good one.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:26:54 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: I am super kawaii, you however are roughly the size of the average beluga whale.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:27:28 AM] IHM: How many memes/chan shit have you spewed at me within the time period? Have you ever attempted logic/wit?<br>
[1/23/2010 6:27:32 AM] IHM: I don't think so.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:27:43 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/e/e8/Brittany_with_mudkip.jpg<br>
[1/23/2010 6:27:51 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: Your chan argument is void.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:28:06 AM] IHM: Yeah, and so is that picture considering it's from early 2008<br>
[1/23/2010 6:28:12 AM] IHM: Find something more recent to throw at me<br>
[1/23/2010 6:28:13 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: Once a faggot always a faggot.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:28:23 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: I WANT FRIZZLE BACK<br>

[1/23/2010 6:30:07 AM] IHM: Those are for Josef, and I don't think I'd ever show my tits to a jew<br>
[1/23/2010 6:30:43 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: You know your PN wiki from 2007, gold star.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:31:32 AM] IHM: I've not followed PN happenings in quite awhile, nor have I followed internet happenings. See, there's this great place, it's called outside. I'd tell you to try it, but you're hopeless.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:32:11 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: Outside place, where you bag groceries and scare away small children.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:32:41 AM] IHM: That's a lot better than what you're doing, SL and twitter all the time huh<br>
[1/23/2010 6:33:04 AM] IHM: Specifically SL, because your first life isn't so awesome is it, so you have to go live it out on SL<br>
[1/23/2010 6:33:12 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: You are so done, choke on your words harder bitch.<br>
[1/23/2010 6:33:17 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: Makes me all hot and bothered<br>
[1/23/2010 6:33:22 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: Almost as much as hearing you cry<br>
[1/23/2010 6:33:26 AM] IHM: Oh no, not the e-threats<br>
[1/23/2010 6:33:36 AM] IHM: What a tough guy<br>
[1/23/2010 6:33:52 AM] IHM: You like to throw it at linden labs too don't you? Too bad nobody cares enough to listen<br>
[1/23/2010 6:34:04 AM] Tizzers Foxchase: http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/6/64/Brittany_and_josef.jpg<br>

== Cool Troll Fighting Crew ==
[[Image:Cool Troll Fighting Crew.jpg|left|thumb|220px|ctfc]]

{{squote|"Anyone associated with ctfc will be ruined"|IHM on the ctfc, right before frizzle joined and she quickly [[shut the fuck up]]}}

To IHM's surprise, CTFC members were [[Leet|harder to dox]] than she thought. So she decided to attempt to [[blackmail]] a user of the CTFC, who was trolling her from the start of the blackmail into giving her information. The member of the CTFC then sarcastically begged for mercy. He trolled IHM and made her think she had an iron grip of him and some other members. Her so called "doxing" would not come into a realization as she was just the intelius [[whore]] for the [[FCTC]] and [[Patriotic Nigras]]. After further [[Fapping|playing]] with her [[Vagina|feeble brain]] the member revealed himself to be a [[N00b|troll]] and IHM decided to go back to her silly habits telling people to [[An Hero|get a life]] and a [[Chris Crocker|gay lover]]. 

{{squote|You're an idiot if you get on my bad side. I'll get my revenge on you in some way, I can guarantee that to you. I'll confide in sources you don't know existed, I'll take charge and have my own personal army fucking your shit up, ripping you to shreds, letting them have their rightful piece of you if you aren't smart enough to stay on my go0d side. I don't attack innocent people, but if you dare take a hit at me, your shit will get fucked up. Huge reality check for you, and I won't give up until you're so miserable you can't even cry. People know not to make me mad in person, bad things happen. You little internet bitches are just starting to realize. If you give me one piece of information, no matter how miniscule it may seem, I can use that to build a whole web of shit around you, and there is no escape. I won't stop. You motherfuckers won't know when I'm coming, but as so0n as I do, your world is gonna fall apart. I'm turning into something that you can't define, something you can't stop, something you fear yet crave to be. I have so many different faces, which one have you seen? You can't be sure, none of you know me through and through. I'm a devious little bitch and that's what you hate the most about me, I get what I want. It doesn't matter what it is, I will get it, regardless of what stands in my way. I'll take that little wall you put up, and I will smash it, throw myself against it until you finally crumble. Best part is, it never takes very long for me to do so. That's the irony though, or maybe you think I'm tripping on my ego. Get on my bad side or ask someone who's been on the recieving end of my blows. They'll warn you, and you might not take me seriously but when I smack you in the face and make you lo0k like a fucking moron, you'll wish you'd have listened to your friends, and never gotten near enough to piss me off. Nothing slips with me. Nothing at all. If you lie to me, I have what it takes to find out. If you cheat on me, I watched the whole thing and to0k the right procedures to get as much dirt and information on you as I could, so I could use it as my weapon, like a bullet headed straight for your reputation and sanity. If you say one bad word about me, my friends come and tell me, and when I attack you and you send your friends after me, they are secretly feeding information to me ABOUT you.|IHM on a rage trip, believing she has a personal army}}
