Original character
[[Image:Theoc.jpg|thumb|A band of original characters frolicking in the woods.]]
[[Image:BlazesonicFORMULA.jpg|thumb|With this forumal, even [[you]] can create an original character!]]
Often created by [[deviantART|TARTlet]]s, but found all over the [[Internet]], an '''original character''' is either one of two things:

# A character in [[fan fiction]] that is not part of [[canon]].
# A character in [[original fiction]].

[[Lies|Although these can be well done]], <s>many</s> <s>damn, nearly all</s> [[no more than 99|about 99%]] of these fall into the [[Mary Sue]] trap. These characters are [[Unwarranted Self Importance|usually self-inserts of the artist]], always depicting themselves with [[Mary Sue]] qualities and having every male anime fag in the drawing fawning all over them. Scientists believe this is some form of compensating for their lack of a life [[IRL]].

[[Image:Assume Male FIRST by AmericanLink.gif|thumb|right|[[gay|Male]] OCs made by females never resemble actual men.]]

The moniker "original character" itself is (of course) [[irony|ironic]], as less than two percent of all original characters are in fact possessed of the slightest shred of originality. Truly "original" characters nowadays are as rare as fucking [[Bigfoot]].

Often abbreviated as "OC". We would also like to point out that the character is our rightful property and it is wrong to use it in an unauthorized manner, you thieving fucks. Copyright infringement is wrong, so DO NOT STEAL.

==Kinds of OCs==

===[[Furries]]===
[[Image:leopardfurfag1.jpg|thumb|A furfag [[asking for it|wanting sex]].]]
Most furries have an OC based on '''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]''', one of the leading causes of AIDS on the Internet. Basically, all they do is take a canon character "as a template" and simply add more features, such as a different palette, new clothes, or [[yiff|no clothes at all]]. Some are even lazy enough to just make the color of their fur darker and pass it off as [[Shamwow|the greatest thing ever spawned]]. Is your character an Amy Rose with no quills? Original character! Have a Sonic with a green racing stripe on his head? Original Character! Knuckles with blue gloves? That's an original character! Other furfags can go far enough to make [[TL;DR|detailed profiles]] of their OC, trying to make them look as if they were as unique as a goddamn snowflake. The profiles are even more abysmal than the characters' recolorings and usually include shitty and cliched descriptions such as "Robotnik destroying their home village" (with zero explanation), and being the love interest of some [[canon]] character.

The obsession [[furries]] have with their ''Sonic'' OCs is so unbelievable that you will indeed [[shit bricks]]. They will often commission or beg people to draw their OC since they know perfectly well that they are untalented hacks. They [[fap|thrive]] on seeing their character in varying art styles and even look at it as an [[Bullshit|accomplishment]]. Some of them take their time to turn their OC to a [[fursuit]] and wears them to various [[Anthrocon|furry conventions]] and takes their personality. Another one of their wet dreams is to hack ''Sonic'' games by changing their palette, as shown below.

===[[Animu|Anime]]===

[[Image:Dbwtf2.jpg|thumb|'''Fun Fact:''' because of original characters, the abortion known as ''[[Dragon Ball AF]]'' was created, and fanboys of the Internet still manage to eat it up.]]

With every anime, there is always a fandom. Regardless of how [[Dragon Ball Z|plotless]] it seems or how [[Pokemon|gay it is]], there will always be a fandom. In any fandom for any [[animu]], you can guarantee that there will be poorly-written [[fanfiction]] with poorly-conceived OCs. But the question is how poorly made can they possibly be? The truth is that they can be so uncreative that their OC is nothing more than a clone of a canon character. An example would be [[Death Note|Light Yagami]] falling in love with a girl who just happened to be exactly like him. They would share the same manner of potato chip-eating, laughing and having orgasms after writing for twenty minutes straight. After all that, Light still manages to get over the sheer creepiness of them possibly [[incest|being]] [[Twincest|twins]]. Their OC paired up with a canon is equivalent to the canon character just dry humping a gender-bending mirror.

However, the clone character will not always be paired with the person they copy. Another example is having [[Inuyasha]] paired with a Kagome clone. Of course the clone would have somehow killed off Kagome, join the team and marry Inuyasha at the end, forgetting that he married the same person who killed his previous love interest. The only difference from her and Kagome would be wavier hair and [[Catgirl|cat ears]].

Since some people are lazy enough to not even make a clone character, they do the method that's even more lazy and uncreative; merging characters. At least clone characters allow people to add their own little tidbits ([[Dragon Ball AF|non-existent]] as they may be), but merged characters are just made by taking two (or more) characters from different animus, and just turn them into a hell-child. It really makes one wonder why they couldn't come up with anything normal or good in the very least. Not only are the physical characteristics fused together, personalities, profiles, and even back-stories are also poorly stitched together in an orgy of faggotry.

''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' is possibly the greatest thing to happen to [[otaku|fandomkind]] since the [[Interbutts]]. In a dazzling display of whoring out to fans and making [[over 9000|countless amounts]] of money, Square Enix [[divide by zero|did the unthinkable]] and combined the greatest sources of [[hentai]] into a shitty video game: [[animu]], [[Disney]], and ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' mixed together in a raging romp of repeatedly raping random Disney movies and characters. [[LHC|Fusion]] of this much [[raped|pure]] [[The_Comprehensive_Theory_of_Lulz|retard]] is responsible for destroying the ability of TARTlets to pick differing cartoon characters to [[tracing|draw]].

As if there weren't enough ''Kingdom Hearts'' fanboys and fangirls, [[shit nobody cares about|they continue to create countless OCs in form of keyweilders, Nobodie, and Heartless]]. There are many clubs dedicated to the genocide pool of disaster, like [[Org Infinity]].

===Original Fiction===
There are none. Let's leave it at that.

==How [[YOU]] can make an original character==
Just take these easy steps below:

# Take an anime, cartoon, novel, or video game character.
# Find an image of them on the Internet.
# [[Trace]] it.
# Change the color of their hair.
# Give them a name.
# Put ''your'' name all over the picture and show your (nonexistent) copyright over it. That's right, everyone wants to steal it.
# Angst over some MCR and make up a horrendously cliche backstory for them.
# Repeat.
# [[????]]
# [[Profit]]!
