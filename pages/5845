Notable Achievements of the Patriotic Nigras
{{subpage|Patriotic Nigras}}

The [[Patriotic Nigras]] have done a great many things. So many, in fact, that their sheer number made the main wiki page practically unreadable.

== PN and Greater Niggerology ==

This phase started around the beginning of [[Last Thursday|April]]. It began the phase of PN operations, including PSYOPS, [[loldongs|infiltration]], advanced weaponry, and cell-based information hiding techniques that would make any [[Al Qaeda]] operative jealous. 

=== Evading IP Bans - The Discovery ===

Many nigras, especially those who had been raiding for months, had fallen victim to a new type of ban, reserved only for the worst offenders - a dreaded [[Perma-ban|IP ban]]. As while an [[IP_address|IP address]] is recordable and necessary for using the [[Second Life]] application, as opposed to the non-vital information of the Hard Drive ID or [[MAC_address|MAC address]], the IP could not be spoofed in the open-source SL client via ShoopedLife. For long, PN was at a standstill. However, a discovery of an application labeled Proxifier that sent all traffic through a specified proxy, paired with a working SOCKS5 proxy (or, upon later examination, a Tor node) bypassed any IP ban. The veteran nigras quickly got back to disrupting the furfag community though a series of massive operations.

== The First Furfag War ==

A few weeks after [[furfags]] invaded Woodbury University in April 2007, making the former shrine to /b/ a den of [[faggotry]], anti-griefer security forces started to deploy infantry, spy, and recon units to various sims, the PN forums, and [[IRC]] with the [[furry|Second Lifers]] expressing doubts that PN was effectively going to invade their sims (Operation Superlaser), while at the same time urging other sim owners to send their own forces to the scene.

=== Operation: [[Tacgnol]] Storm ===

[[Furfag]] coalition-building efforts were so successful that by the time the fighting (Operation: Tacgnol Storm) began on May 12th, 2007, many sims, such as the Virtual World Trade Center, owned by [[IntLib]], were alerted and actively deployed anti-griefer measures. However, PN forces caught the community off guard by the sheer scale of the attack. Originally, three cells were given four targets to attack - places, such as Club Arsheba, {{slsim|Furnation%20Prime|FurNation}}, and {{slsim|Rainbow%20Tiger|Rainbow Tiger}}, as well as SLers such as IntLib and [[Prokofy Neva]]. However, upon coordination with other members of cells via secure channels, PN forces were able to quickly mobilize and repeatedly crash or lag target sims. With no clear spy problem evident, Mudkips Acronym gave the order to combine into one cell and hit anything with build or that could be crashed.

=== Operation: [[Longcat]] Shield ===

The second large raid was a repeat of Tacgnol Storm intended to take advantage of the new technology engineered by PN [[hacker|scripters]]. While during the first hour, many [[nigra]]s logged on to find their accounts [[banhammer|banned]] in advance, when [[sockpuppet|alts]] were created the raid proceeded as usual. While videos of the raid are still being processed, a video of the [[Spengbob|Spengbab]] Lolcube weapon is available [http://youtube.com/watch?v=hfsTBGIiUF8 here] and is worth a look.

=== Operation: Pwned by LL ===

Woodbury University was shut down by Linden Lab for being (supposedly) a PN BASE OF OPERATIONS! This prompted an [http://www.secondlifeherald.com/slh/2007/07/woodbury-univer.html an immensely lolable boo-hoo] by Tizzers Foxchase (PN wannabe) and huge shitstorm of lulz thereafter that dominated the front page of the ''Second Life Herald'' for well over a week after. [[Prokofy Neva]] started foaming at the mouth again, and much lulz was had.

Of course, as the Woodbury University sim was never a PN base of any sort, PN scored a most epic win by unintentionally framing Tizzers for their crimes. The nigras are now considering infiltrating other groups and sims so as to frame them for supporting [[trolling|cyberterrorism]].

== O HAI ^BAN^ WELCOME TO LEADERDOM ==

After the multiple fags holding office as leader of the PN, we thought it was time to finally elect one who could pierce our path with his drill. And so, ^ban^ was the new leader, and path-piercing he did do.

=== Operation: Partyhat ===

In honor of the [[4chan|motherland]]'s birthday, PN organized a raid filled with thousands of party hats. Even though they weren't scripted to be sim crashing weapons, many sims went down due to the sheer amount of win. 

=== Operation: Morning Glory ===

It was the 5th of November, Guy Fawkes night. PN decided that Intlib had not had enough sleepless nights, and so they waged a full-scale war on all of Intlib's sims to force him and the other srs bsns fgts to stay awake all night guarding their sims. It was a devastating psychological attack that caused many of the anti-lulz army to vanish for two days, resulting in epic raids through-out the day. 

=== Operation: Battlecruiser ===

The PN were approached by a Wired reporter that wanted to document them and their activities. Thus, a raid of epic proportions was scheduled. What was originally going to be a small raid of a handful of Nigras turned into one of the largest scale raids to date, with full Martyr and Nigra participation, causing countless sim crashes and lulz all over the grid. The anti-lulz army attempted to play down the massive raid by getting one of their fags to dress up in a newbie suit and take a screenshot, but were quickly lol'd at and completely disregarded because they sucks cocks.

== PN World Tour 2008 ==

After ^ban^ stepped down and FrizzleFry became the new PN Warboss, another burst of activity shot forth from all orifices of the mighty Nigras.

=== Bhutto's Closed ===

After the death of [[Benazir Bhutto]], several butthurt [[derkaderps|muslims]] decided to throw an e-funeral for her in ''Second Life''. Sensing the massive lulz potential, the PN immediately brought its best minds together and concocted an epic raid. Dressed as [[derkaderps|muslims]], the Nigras sent out megaprims with pictures of goatse and a shooped Bhutto saying gb2/kitchen. After all the other Nigras were banned, one brave Nigra ran up to the giant picture of Bhutto and exploded with the glory of Allah and Muhammed Hassan.

=== Hunter Talon - PuppetMan ===

The [http://foo.secondlifeherald.com/slh/2008/04/hunter-talon-re.html ''Second Life Herald'' did an article] about the death of Hunter Talon, a JLU faggot that had spinal AIDS and couldn't move or walk. While the JLU was busy crying over the death of their beloved rubber puppet, the PN snuck into the funeral procession and spammed it with a picture of PuppetMan being held up with strings by a Nigra puppetmaster with PN carved into his chest. This created so much butthurt that any account that had even seen the texture was banned, resulting in WU getting deleted yet again and IntLibber temp B&.

Not long after the raid ended, [[Slowpoke]] showed up and started firing off Bhutto cubes from the Bhutto raid. Everybody lol'd.

=== OSGrid ===

During their many battles against the racist and fascist Lindens, the Nigras were told of a wonderful place, where a man was not judged by the color of his skin or the length of his cat, but by his willingness to have fun and enjoy himself. The Nigras journeyed far and wide before they came to this place, where they erected a temple to their illustrious god. The natives of this area did not like this, and set about the place wearing white sheets and carrying pitch forks and chased the Nigras from these lands. As it turned out, this land was rife with racism and hatred, even moreso than ''Second Life''.

The Nigras went on to immediately declare war on these heathen lands. Within a few minutes of the declaration of war, OSGrid's asset servers were completely broken, a majority of the regions had been completely destroyed, and the ones that remained had all of their objects rescripted into goatse and gore cubes.

=== Chanology Gets Scared the Fuck Off ===

At some point, a really [[Darviela Maravarona|butthurt fag]] tried to request PN be his personal army and was flatly denied. After being trolled, he ran back to his moralfag hive and fussed about how PN knows the deep dark secret of Chanology (that it and anyone associated with it is a [[faggot|gigantic faggot]].) A few moralfags tried to vamp the site and massively failed, as the PN servers were hardened to [[DragonForce]]-level metal after millions of failed furfag attempts. After PN threatened to dox drop the entire forum and use Scientology money from the dox to fund its Russian branch, the thread was deleted and several people involved were banned. Any further attempts to raid PN receive the same treatment because Enturb is scared to death the Nigra Death Squad will knock on their door.

Ever so often the fail army shows back up to [[BAWWWWW]] and PN stomps them back down.

=== Furrum Obliterated ===
:''See also: [[SaviorChan]]''

At some point, a butthurt furfag couldn't take it anymore and created a forum to try and coordinate furfag floods in an attempt to stop the SaviorChan [[delayclose|Delay]] swarm and its cold, unfeeling, all-seeing eyes full of hate and exterminatus. Eventually, one of the furfags was dumb enough to post a link to their forum on the site during a delayclose bombardment, thinking that it would bring all of his furfag friends to the site in safety, but it instead alerted the Nigras to their faggotry.

As it turned out, the furfags had been coordinating the floods all along from this website, so the brave Nigras set out to purge Furrum. The first operation was standard doxing and humiliating, followed by a complete and total flood of every single board on the site. Then the delayborg activated and burned the website into nothing. In the end, all that was left were burned furfag corpses and a Page Not Found error screen.

Eventually, the Furrum admins put a page up admitting that they had lost and the glorious Nigras had won, destroying the furfag morale and eliminating the furfags once and for all, or so they thought. Later on, moot patched the post deleting exploit, which brought in a shitstorm of furfags and undid everything that SaviorChan had done for the past 5 months. In disgust, N3X15 dropped support for SaviorChan and declared Operation: Savior officially closed. The Nigras officially abandoned the established chans and set out to create their own: 915chan, which brought back the win of old. 

=== Alliance Navy Meets Copybot ===

Utilizing the account of the furfag in a bodybag, Avena Marshall, the PN was able to get ahold of every sooper seekrit AN vehicle, weapon and armor and copybotted them all and released them publicly, resulting in massive butthurt from the AN.

This was soon expanded into an even bigger operation, targetting all of the military roleplay fags like the Merczateers that fag around.

=== Brainiac Core Released ===

Since Carigorp's account was used to destroy the JLU's headquarters, they had hardly been a threat to the PN at all, but just for good measure, the Nigras got ahold of and released the scripts used to query the Brainiac database which stores information on every single character in Second Life, including dox and credit card information given to the JLU by corrupt Lindens.

In reponse, Kalel immediately changed the query address on the website, but the Nigras keep discovering it and he keeps having to change it.
