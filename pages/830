Ban fucking everyone
{{finalsolutions}}

'''Banning fucking everyone''' is one of the final acts of a [[mod]]erator. It is done either right before they become [[an hero]], or just because the mod is a [[bureaucratic fuck|dickhead]]. Occasionally, banning fucking everyone is used to clean house, but it is always used to further the crusade for the [[lulz]].

==Obtaining and Using the Banhammer==
#Become a board member
#[[Suck cock]]
#[[promotion|Get promoted to Mod]]
#[[A frank discussion of mental illness|Lose your mind]] and/or take off your sanity mask and act like the [[psychopath]] you really are
#Wait for a [[trigger]]; make sure it's incomprehensible to others as to why it's your trigger
#BAN!
#BAN!
#BAN!
#????
#[[PROFIT!]]
#[[Suicide|Quit IRL]]

===Proper Banning===
No one is safe when everyone is fucking banned. On youthink.com, a [[fat]] moderator named ebonysoul went batshit crazy and banned every member, every mod, and the owner. Had she thrown herself from a cliff afterward, she would have reached mod heaven. The ultimate goal is to go down in a blaze of "[[WTF]] just happened?"
