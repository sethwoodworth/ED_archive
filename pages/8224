It all started when SUP eliminated [[Basic accounts]], followed by [[YHBT|a series of news posts]] not clarifying the changes, followed again by the <del>[[ban|blocking]] of certain interests on the [[shit nobody cares about|popular interests page]].</del> '''[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|DISREGARD THAT]]''', IT WAS A TECHNICAL ERROR.

==The Road to Drama also cox==
===March 13, 2008 - 100-Day Anniversary From Hell===
[[Image:Strike-icon.gif|right|thumb|[[Fact]].]]
* A news post announcing the [[shit nobody cares about|100-day anniversary]] of SUP's acquisition of LiveJournal is made.
* Users notice they are no longer capable of making Basic accounts. The first [[drama bomb]] lands.
* [[troll|VP of Product Development]] {{lj|jasonshellen}} quickly wades into the unwashed masses of [[fandom]] and [http://news.livejournal.com/106731.html?thread=68484587#t68484587 proceeds to tell them] that the changes were made so that the [[retard|average LiveJournal user]] could understand the account creation process.
* [[troll|VP of Product Development]] {{lj|jasonshellen}} quickly turns to [[crybaby|complaining]] about personal attacks made against him in the resulting [[clusterfuck]].


{{quote|From a product perspective it was more about creating a new registration process that was easier for [[retard|new user]]s to understand.|jasonshellen, talking down to LJ users [[for great justice]]}}

* Somewhere in the mess {{lj|leah_lightwing}} admits to [http://news.livejournal.com/106731.html?thread=68522219#t68522219 owning 70+ LiveJournal accounts]. Not entirely relevant, but still [[lol]].
* [[Bradfitz|Brad]] gives [http://brad.livejournal.com/2368071.html his thoughts] on the matter, claiming that he wasn't consulted prior to the elimination of the accounts. It is expected that fandom will [[The Great LiveJournal Strikethrough of 2007|kill him a second time]]. [[Lulz]]y moments include {{lj|njyoder}} bringing up the [[shit nobody cares about|LiveJournal social contract]] in an effort to argue against advertising, and everyone else [[unfunny|making remarks]] about [[Soviet Russia]] and the [[KGB]].

===March 14, 2008 - Clarifications===
[[Image:Nosik-mudkips.jpg|right|thumb|Anton Nosik does, in fact, like [[Mudkip]]s.]]
* {{lj|theljstaff}} makes a [http://news.livejournal.com/106909.html second post] to the News feed in an effort to clarify their [[rape|new policy]], only to ramble on and [[TL;DR|not actually say anything]]. Enraged [[furry|furries]] rush to the News feed to post [[cat macros]] in droves. The second [[drama bomb]] lands.
* [[At least 100]] LiveJournal users migrate to InsaneJournal. Still, [[shit nobody cares about|people fail to notice]].
* Several users all [[spam|post the same link]] to the [http://eng.cnews.ru/news/top/indexEn.shtml?2008/03/13/291948 Russian news site CNews] containing a [[Engrish|poorly-translated]] interview with SUP "[[KGB|head of blog]]" department Anton Nosik.


{{quote|We do not consider it necessary to inform those, who have not opened a basic account during 9 years of LiveJournal’s existence, that there is no such an opportunity any longer.|Anton Nosik, displaying his [[George Bush doesn't care about black people|immense capacity to care]]}}

===March 15-18th, 2008 - Interests Denied===
[[Image:Strike-how-we-roll.jpg|right|thumb|Oh for fuck's sake.]][[Image:Strike-LJ-epic-fails.jpg|right|thumb|This was posted [[at least 100]] times to the News feed.]][[Image:Strike-death-threats.png|right|thumb|Death threats!]][[Image:Strike-blame-communism.png|right|thumb|[[Fact]]: Capitalist policies are a [[communism|Communist]] product.]]
* Enraged by the marketing practices enacted by SUP, users continue to [[flounce]] in [[at least 100|record numbers]]. Not satisfied with going quietly, most decide to [[attention whore|make a scene]] on their way out.
* As one [[clusterfuck]] begins to die out, another one begins when InsaneJournal [[luser|user]] '''stewardess''' posts [http://stewardess.insanejournal.com/228245.html a public entry] with a table showing a list of entries censored on LiveJournal's [[shit nobody cares about|Popular Interests]] page. The third [[drama bomb]] lands.
* Attacks on LiveJournal's [[homosexual|sexuality]] and lack of respect for fandoms begin en masse, alongside [http://news.livejournal.com/106909.html?thread=70212765#t70212765 talks about the beginnings] of a possible "[[Counter-Strike|content strike]]."
* And, of course, it isn't long before a [http://community.livejournal.com/ljcensor2008/profile community devoted to the technical error] is formed.
* Without a second word, SUP backpedals faster than [[Carlos Mencia]] in a room full of [[Mexico|Mexicans]] and removes the filter on the censored interests. 
* LJ staffer {{lj|marta}} proceeds to [http://news.livejournal.com/106909.html?thread=70129565#t70129565 inform everyone] that the blocked interests were the result of a [[VTEC Just Kicked In Yo|technical problem]], only to be bombarded with [[butthurt|demands for an apology]] and [[conspiracy|theories]] about what happened from [[Computer Science III|qualified experts]].
* To add insult to injury, Anton Nosik once again speaks out against fandoms in another interview. [[retard|Inquisitive individuals]] run choice quotes through [[Babelfish]] and quickly take offense at [http://news.livejournal.com/106909.html?thread=70303133#t70303133 the result].
* {{lj|darkrosetiger}} posts an [http://darkrosetiger.livejournal.com/373663.html entry with a full translation] of the interview, taking note of Nosik's understanding of the situation. Responses include insults and [[internet tough guy|death threats]].


{{quote|The audience of LJ is divided into 3 groups. There is the [[people|silent majority]], which uses LJ for their own needs and is indifferent to who, when and with what money made such a resource and supports it. There are the [[trolls|positive minority]] (7-10 percent in the Russian LJ), these people like LJ, they consider it useful and want it to develop further. They help us, including [[flame wars|constructive criticism]], thanks to which we correct our mistakes. And there is the [[terrorists|third category]]. They endlessly, during the entire existence of LJ promote lour initiatives, whose only purpose is to bring harm to LJ, its founders, their goal is to criticize, destabilize and ruin our reputation. They are usually motivated by wanting to attract attention to themselves. And they are [[The Great LiveJournal Strikethrough of 2007|successful every time]].|Anton Nosik, SUP's head of blog department}}

* Despite all of this, [http://news.livejournal.com/106909.html?thread=70359453#t70359453 one user actually posts a positive comment] only to get jumped by several people with butthurt, [http://community.livejournal.com/stupid_free/983260.html?thread=175566556#t175566556 which would later be mentioned] in {{ljcomm|stupid_free}}

===March 16-20th, 2008 - The Strike is Declared===
[[Image:bout_my_boycott.png|right|thumb|Bitches don't know about {{lj|beckyzoole}}'s protest.]]
* [[Pagan]] Jew {{lj|beckyzoole}} [http://beckyzoole.livejournal.com/394548.html unilaterally declares] a boycott. The announcement is [http://community.livejournal.com/useless_facts/1812461.html posted] to communities all over the internet, most of which cover a wide range of unrelated topics like [[politics]] and [http://community.livejournal.com/stupid_free/983260.html baking]. Like with Strikethrough, a whole new set of icons are made.
* Remarkably sane LJ users begin to question the idea of a content strike, [http://news.livejournal.com/106909.html?thread=70332061#t70332061 noting that] it would make more sense for fandom to [[crapflood]] LJ's servers with [[crap]] entries and voice posts and strain [[bandwidth]]. Fandom, not noted for its sanity, ignored the suggestion and plans to go ahead with the non-posts.
* Rumors on the internets about Russian [[Nazi|Anti-Semites]] joining the protest [http://chopchica.livejournal.com/125090.html begin circulating] on the basis that Anton Nosik is an Jew. However, [[some argue]] that these rumors are patently false, as Russian Anti-Semites will be [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3521307,00.html occupied with something else] on the 21st.

==How you could have helped (if you actually cared)==
[[Image:Strike-only-good-comment.png|right|thumb|The only good comment in this entire mess.]]
* If [[you]] or [[fag|your friends]] have an account back from when you were in [[school|middle school]], log in and [[drama bomb|post]]!
* Post [[goatse|original content]] in all of the [[furry|fandom]] journals you can find on 3/21!
* Upgrade all of your [[sock journal|accounts]] to Plus accounts!
* Be certain to [[crapflood]] any one of these [[gay|fine]] LJ communities in the series.
* BONUS: Post [[copypasta]] for added [[lulz]].

==The Aftermath==
{{needsmore|counter-strike content and lulz}}
As of 2am UTC 3-22-08, the Great LiveJournal Content Strike of 2008 has proven itself to be an [[epic fail]]ure.
[[Image:Strike-failure.png|right|thumb|what]]
* Lulz-worthy LiveJournal group {{ljcomm|fbr_trash}} decided to help with the anti-furry and [[child pornography]] strike by allowing members to post whatever crap they felt needed to be posted... the community was updated [[over 9000|2,195 times]] during the strike. Many lulz were had. [[Rickroll]]s were performed, and furries were trashed.
* Regular [[lolcow]] {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} had an Off-Topic Tuesday-like celebration of the strike, with [[at least 100]] posts about [[shit nobody cares about|very interesting topics]].
* [[jackass|Pranksters]] spammed {{lj|nebris}}' LiveJournal before getting banned.
* Literally [[over 9000]] posts were made to {{ljcomm|statements}}.
* {{lj|beckyzoole|beckytool}}'s LiveJournal was [http://beckyzoole.livejournal.com/397819.html?style=mine overrun by responsible citizens] during the strike.
[[Image:Epiccombo.jpg|right|thumb|the only time a [[combo|CCCC-combo is fine too]] in {{ljcomm|indiefucks}}]]

== Global Reaction ==

[[India]] joined an international chorus of calls for dialog yesterday after pro-''basic accounts'' [[The_Great_Livejournal_Content_Strike_of_2008|protests]] in [[cyberspace]] spilled over into street violence, while [[Japan]] urged {{ljcomm|_b0st0n_snark}} to consider the implications for the [[blogosphere]].

International condemnation of [[LiveJournal]] Inc.'s action was muted.

[[LiveJournal]]'s peak user community, {{ljcomm|yiffexchange}}, was mostly shut down [[last Thursday]], two days after {{ljcomm|bipolypagangeek}} security forces crushed days of [[The_Great_Livejournal_Content_Strike_of_2008|protests]]. {{lj|theljstaff}} said only 10 people were killed, but the [[blogosphere]]'s government-in-exile, [[Frank the Goat]], said the death toll was closer to [[9000]].

The spiritual leader of [[LiveJournal]] and Nobel peace laureate who fled to [[India]] in 2007, [[bradfitz|Brad Fitzpatrick]], said that the international community had the “moral responsibility” to remind [[LiveJournal]] Inc. to be a good host for emo, morbid self-absorption and "irony", but added that [[LiveJournal]] deserved to sell all your [[dox]].

[[LiveJournal]] Inc. has declared a “people’s war” of [[Terrorism|security]] and [[propaganda]] against support for [[bradfitz|the Brad]], underlining that it will not heed calls from around the globe for a lenient response to the [[The_Great_Livejournal_Content_Strike_of_2008|strike]].
