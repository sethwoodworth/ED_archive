#An Internet shock site ([http://www.lemonparty.org www.lemonparty.org]) which consists solely of a picture of three old men having sex.  
#The aforementioned image.
#As a verb, the act of posting the Lemonparty image or a link to the site with hopes of [[luring]] the innocent, done sometimes tag-teamed with other members of [[The Power 5]].

Like [[goatse|goatse.cx]], the idea behind '''Lemonparty''' is to make it so innocuous that the uninitiated will not hesitate to follow the link. Of course, you'd only believe that if your understanding of English is on par with a three-year-old with [[Asperger's Syndrome]]. "Lemon" is slang for an "old man," hence things like Blind Melon, and [[Weird Al|Blind Melon Yankovic]] (if you saw the Christmas special). Therefore, a Lemonparty is a party of old men. There are now links to other sites advertised on the page, check it out for more info.  

Example of Lemonparty use:
::'''Bill''': Do you have the link to that "Carebears are Love" [[meme]]?
::'''Ted''': [http://www.lemonparty.org here ya go]!
::'''Bill''': Dude, [[WTF]]! You lemonpartied me! bogus

==Mainstream Exposure==
