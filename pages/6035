{{moar|everything}}
{{potential}}
The Jewish-controlled media have turned their gluttonous gaze towards our beloved internets culture. The corporate-backed company known as [[Rocketboom]] and their copypasta website [[Know Your Meme]] are attempting to choke us and our memes for every dime they can. These filthy kike thieves must be stopped. This is where [[you]] come in. Help defend the internet with '''Operation: Stop Their Scheme''', an ongoing operation targeted at [[Know Your Meme]] for stealing [[memes]] and using them to get Jew gold.
The attack is on the 4th of December.

{{quote| Fellow anons, 

Memes are awesome. They are give us lulz. They are what define us.

But in secret, a large corporation has utilized this, 
taken advantage of us, to make millions of dollars out of our work. 

Backed by Sony Entertainment capital, a company called Rocketboom has exploited us with a website called Know Your Meme.

Memes belong to everyone. Why should anyone get money for them? If not us, the creators, why them?
Does it make sense when our beloved  chans, where the content is coming from, 
can barely keep their websites up while KYM can afford ferraris and big houses? 

And they are backed by Sony. If their theft doesnâ€™t enrage you, their hypocrisy should.
If one of us posts a walkthrough on how to beat a game with a 5-second clip looping in the background used without permission? 
DMCAs. Lawsuits.  And what will happen if Sony tries to COPYRIGHT our memes?

They have repeatedly broken rules 1 & 2. They are responsible for causing the cancer that now exists in this very thread, in our /b/.
The sources of the flood of Newfags and Faggotry have been left ignored.

However, despite their sins,
The Final straw is [http://tinyurl.com/memeoverload this]

It's time we fight back
