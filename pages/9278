In case you ever thought a [[Youtube Poop]] was bad, you haven't seen '''Youtube Poop: The Movie'''. The tale behind it is quite [[boring|vivid]], and sparked [[YouTube]] dramas before it was even released. This movie has been in production for over six months, and there are sites all over the Internets for this upcoming release. There is a wiki, a [[Facebook]]-style community site and a [[Wtf|Youtube IMAX]] site, all created by the person who believes that [[Nobody cares|people will care]] about his new video and being under the impression that his shit is going to be big. The movie is going to have '''[[Tl;dw|16 parts in total]]''', and considering each part is roughly 5 minutes, is 1 hour and 20 minutes of pure shit. The guy behind this terrible shitstorm is known as {{youtube2|NarutoIchigo97|NarutoIchigo97}}. The worst part is that he is [[13 year old boy|13 years old...]]

==The Movie: Now in PG-13==

Since NarutoIchigo is so [[Underageb&|young]] and probably has his parents behind him half the time as he most likely uses the [[fail|family computer in the living room]], NarutoIchigo is planning to release the movie with a PG-13 rating, so at least there will be no [[furry]] [[porn]] in it like every other YouTube Poop is full of these days. But, since NarutoIchigo is such a [[Pussy|rebel]], he's also making an "uncut" version, which appears to be too [[yiff|sexual in nature]] that it cannot be uploaded to YouTube, and will be uploaded to MegaVideo instead.

...Wait, if it's on MegaVideo, is it a YouTube Poop? [[Fuck|OSHI-]]

===He even made (a ton of) trailers===
The movie probably will be discontinued after the second part because so many YouTubers will be [[Bawww]]ing over the shitty content. All his "trailers" simply include mashed copyright clips and are mostly goddamn boring. If you can watch his trailers until the end, you are a god.

<center>'''[[TL;DW]]''': Excessive video compression, unfunny clip mixing and "[[Scam|Upgrade Replay Converter Now!]]"</center>

Ironically, the people who are complaining did the same thing 3 years ago. Although, they didn't make a big deal of it because [[truth|nobody gave a fuck back then]] since the community was just a [[b/|hivemind]], the same people believing that [[not funny|unfunny]] mashups using the same clips is funny. Although, there is probably a chance that it won't be released at all, making NarutoIchigo an [[win|epic troll]], Though this is [[truth|not likely]]. Don't discourage him or link him to the ED just yet. He might [[Oh noes|cancel it]].

There is also going to be a [[Shit Nobody Cares About|sequel to this movie]] sometime in 2011 or [[2012]] according to NarutoIchigo himself.

===The IMAX Experience!===

[[image:The_YouTube_Poop_Movie_-_3D_Glasses.jpg|left|thumb|NarutoIchigo [[Sad|has a pair of these.]]]]
The movie is also supposed to be in 3D, although this will probably never happen. Actually, it won't happen, ever. On top of that, NarutoIchigo is going to render it all at 1080p resolution under the impression everything will be completely fucking sharp. This is what he calls the IMAX experience. He also says that it will be compatible on [[Mac]] and [[PC]]. [[Duh|Yay]]!

=={{youtube2|ytpnews1|YTPnews1}} Responds==

<center><youtube>f0cm6T_HzLA</youtube></center>
This video response sparked so much [[lulz]], since YTPnews has quite a lot of subscribers, all of them being [[furries]] and/or [[Youtube Poop]] fans, mostly, and usually always, both. Even YTPnews1 is a furry himself, what with his obsession with [[Eric W. Schwartz|Sabrina the Skunk]]. NarutoIchigo97 originally planned to cancel the movie after seeing this, then decided he wasn't going to and still carried on. NarutoIchigo wants to strike revenge on Stuart for his helpful criticism.

|Hey if you want to love me, don't trust on Stuart Kay Reilly about the movie, i just want to be a director like Steven Spielberg, so, don't trust in Stu Reilly about the movie, and forget about that movie rant, but the other poops AND some informative things on YTP News, so please don't hate me, i fucking hate when they hate me because of a movie, Damn you, Stuart K.

==NarutoIchigo97 himself==

{{quote|Apologies to 4evermario for Jumping Link and AceLand Studios for your YTP Movie Logo|After Aaron [[Copypasta|copied]] images for his movie posters. Aaron could be [[Chris-Chan|someone]]'s long lost son.}}

[[image:AaronSteven.PNG|right|thumb|NarutoIchigo, Aka Aaron IRL]]

NarutoIchigo, Aka '''Aaron Steven Montalvo Alvarez''', is a [[weeaboo]] from Union City, New Jersey. Aaron is probably an [[asspie]] already, proven by his [[USI|way of thinking]] and the fact that he still uses [[Microsoft Paint]] in belief that it is [[No|good]]. He also happens to be a Mexican, shown by his obsession with translating fucking everything into Spanish. He also has an obsession of leaving his [[dox]] everywhere, leaving his [[Facebook|Failbook]] on his personal website among other [[Shit nobody cares about|pages of his]]. Aaron set his YouTube account age to 20, so he can show [[goatse|inappropriate content]] to his school friends 2 b teh kewlz.

Aaron's acts of newfaggotry include:
*Thinking [[Sonic]] is good
*Watching cartoons made after 2000
*Referring to a [[computer]] as a CPU
*Being a Arab
*Having a [[Wii]] and liking it
*[[Facepalm|"I am here for some random stuff!"]]
*"i damn hate it when my mom goes mad!"
*[[Smiley|"XD"]]
Chances are, since Aaron acts like such a [[newfag]], he's probably already found /b/, like every other 13-year-old nowadays.

Because all [[retarded|important]] people have their own "companies", Aaron has founded '''[[Fail|NaruIchi97 Studios Inc]]'''. Aaron has around 70 subscribers currently, most of them probably just waiting for his movie so they can criticize it. Undeniably, the amount of effort he's put into this is [[truth|fucking sad]].

Aaron puts this notice in everything he makes to try and make his plagiarism look half-decent:
