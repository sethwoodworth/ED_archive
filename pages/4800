'''LeisureSuitGaming''' AKA '''SilentRob''' and '''[[powerword|Rob Lowe]]''' (srsly), is a once awesome [[Video Game Reviewers|video game reviewer]] who fell from grace.

Robert is an anorexic, unemployed, buck-toothed, e-begging [[ITG|internets tough guy]] who is more known nowadays for his [[BAWWW|whiny emo diatribes]] than for his video game reviews.  If it weren't obvious from his username, Robert lives life as though he were an [[IRL]] [[Kevin Smith]] character.

He got [[e-fame|his big break]] on [[YouTube]] by taking it up the ass from his idol, [[Armake21]] ([[LeisureSuitGaming#SilentRob_v._Armake|before knifing him in the back]] in a bout of dyslexia-based comment confusion), and constantly reviewing Action 52 in his mothers attic over and over for several years. When he's not half-assing his shit videos with the worlds worst camera and microphone, he habitually blackmails and stalks a female video game reviewer or attacks more popular "YouTubers" (mostly partners) in [[nerd rage|tard rage]] bouts of [[jellyous|jealousy]].

Later on in his youtube career, he eventually stopped making video game reviews. Being the [[butthurt]] faggot that he is, began only making video responses to [[trolls]] instead. He also made a few awful "[[Retsupurae]] baiting 45 degree angled webcam" ''Let's Play''s also, {as if there wasn't enough of those to go around).

==Background==
===Early "Reviews"===
In the early days, Rob was another run-of-the-mill reviewer on YouTube, making angry videos where he spends the best part of seven minutes [[Angry Video Game Nerd|swearing at a ROM of a NES game]] with the occasional cameo from his fat, pot-head [[faggot|boyfriend]] "Roach".  The usual video consisted of him baring his teeth at a blurry webcam, maxing out the mic to total static with his autistic bouts of shouting at his mother, intertwined with sexist comments towards women.

'''Rob has baleeted most of his videos.  We need mirrors.'''

===GameStop Rants===

For one glimmering moment in SilentRob's YouTube career there was a possibility of making something entertaining, but again just turned into a BAWWWWfest over his [[Gamestop| shitty minimum-wage job]].  Apparently it took Rob two full years to figure this out before he quit after being cock-blocked by the female manager, and in a [[PMS|rage]], eventually created a [[TL;DW|100 part rant]] about how working full-time at a GameStop is a shitty idea. What a revelation!<br><br>

===SilentRob Attacks a Customer===

[[Image:RobGoesWigger.jpg|thumb|right|You gotta give Rob some credit.<br>He tries to come across all Gangsta in this photo after taking on a black person, but ends up looking like the Son of Skeletor.]]

When customers weren't prank calling Rob at GameStop for copies of [[Battletoads]], they were dealing with the attitude of a skinny ginger douchebag who went around selling their ''deposit-paid'' pre-ordered games.  A heated debate followed the sale of an already-purchased copy of [[EA|Madden]] that a customer had pre-ordered weeks before.  Instead of apologizing, Rob threw the man's deposit money in his face after said customer expressed disappointment towards Robert's lackluster retail expertise.

===Rob's Adventures in YouTube Partnership===
The first kink in Rob's reputation was when he first got the notion into his tiny brain that his [[bullshit|top quality entertainment]] was worth money, and promptly wrote a letter to [[attention whore|Youtube's Partnership program]] proclaiming himself to be the next [[Angry Video Game Nerd]] (who isn't a YT Partner anyway).

But maybe due to a glitch in the system, or the internets being broken, Rob received a letter back from the Gods of the YouTubes saying [[DO NOT WANT|no thanks]], that his work was [[True|low quality shit and wasn't worth fuck all]]. He promptly created another video to let his fanbase how those evil bastards at YouTube had crucified their video gaming messiah.


And thus we begin our epic saga of Robert's adventures of butthurt jealousy and eBegging...

==SilentRob Versus The World==
[[butthurt|Busting down the floodgates]] about his rejection, Rob went [[Why so serious?|Bruce Wayne]] on the whole Video Game Reviewing community, targeting those whom he valued unworthy of their partnerships.  This went totally un-lulzworthy for a while until the Lord Voldemort of internet reviewers, The [[Irate Gamer]] appeared on his horizon...

===SilentRob v. The Irate Gamer===
<video type="youtube" id="ATZlTILaI3U" width="300" height="250" desc="Irate Gamer Music Video" position="right"/>
[[Image:Irapegamer.png|thumb|left|The Irate Gamer]]
The Irate Gamer was the punching bag of the video game community on Youtube anyway, so Rob saw an easy target to help him [[troll shielding|gain e-sympathy on the internets]].  Thus ensued a ten minute bitch-fest about the man, in which his arguments, for every small truth they may have had, were cockblocked by at least fifteen references to IG "[[blowjob|loving the cock]]". His [[fanboy|fanbase]], being as intelligent as [[lemmings]], followed his orders and started hating on the reviewer, spawning a great, yet pathetic, amount of [[lulz|proxy lulz]] that still lingers to this day.

Unfortunately, the video was promptly flagged to oblivion by Irate Gamer followers due to the fact Rob being the retard that he is hadn't accounted that the Irate Gamer has a much MUCH larger fanbase than his own.  But in his own small world of arrogance and [[unwarranted self importance]], decided that the Irate Gamer himself took it down in outrage, when in truth Mr. Bores probably has never heard of it, let alone seen it.

Robert still harbors a grudge towards the Irate Gamer even to this day, as Mr. Bores got richer and more popular on Youtube,  Rob fucked off back to obscurity and the poor house. Funniest part is that the Irate Gamer also lives in Ohio just like Robbie! Must suck living so close to greatness Rob!

===SilentRob v. AkewsticRockR===
<video type="youtube" id="i8VzpTFPLgM" width="230" height="180" frame="true" position="right"/>
[[Image:26yearoldvirgin.jpg|thumb|left|[[AkewsticRockR]], Proud, noble Youtuber.]]
Seeing as his e-war against the Irate Gamer ended in a mass one sided victory of Falklands War proportions, Mr. Lowe decided this time to maybe go for a softer, less popular video game reviewing partner, this time in the form of [[AkewsticRockR]].

Rob's first prong of attack was to point out how [[gay]] AkewsticRockR was, as that's always a funny and witty thing to do on the internets.  His second was to flank him with comments about how less financially viable Kyle is than Rob, by pointing out that [[srsly|ROB HAS A SWIMMING POOL]]!  The intense level of irony/hypocrisy hasn't dawned on our pal Rob, who hasn't earned any of the above possessions and still leeches off of his parents.

===SilentRob v. Armake===
[[Image:Gblow 02.gif|thumb|right|Rob's wet dream with Armake, [[Last Thursday]].]]
[[Image:SilentRobVsArmake.jpg|thumb|right|The comment in question.]]
Rob sank to a new Lowe and attacked his very own idol.  After being completely crushed by Bookittty, [[The Archfiend]], AkewstickRockR, The Irate Gamer and even his own fans.  Rob saught solace in his only inspiration on Youtube, [[Armake21]].  But what's this?  His idol has not only ripped-off his magnum-opus, but also made a reference to Rob in the video, which he would later delete, [[;_;]].

Unfortunately, being aurally dyslexic, he misheard Marcus' light-hearted quote as a full-blown attack upon his reviewing skills and attempted to destroy the man on his YouTube comments page in a barrage of blasting comments, which rather than make him look like an [[internet tough guy]], made him look like a fucking idiot instead.

{{Quote|Armake sayin shit about me...? ill go ahead and say shit back about that washed up reviewer, unlike armake, im not gonna be a little bitch and weasel a computer out of a close friend and then close my account like a baby saying someone else did it, armake *USED* to be good...key words are USED TO BE.... he sucks dick now and has sucked dick ever since he changed his style....and reviewing action 52...? a little late to the party arent we armake? plus your review sucks compared to mine, I didn't even laugh once....if you wanna see a good action 52 review...watch mine ;-)|SilentRob,  Confusing a friendly joke for a personal attack,  then whoring himself out.}}

===SilentRob v. Bookitty===
There are many [[basement dweller]]s trying for a internet slice of e-fame after seeing how much money the likes of the [[AVGN]] and [[That Guy With The Glasses|The Nostalgia Critic]],  but the majority of them tend to be pathetic [[13 year old]] virgin males.  Bookittty, on the otherhand is exactly the same, bar the fact she's a [[trap|G-G-G-GIRL]]!!!

Rachael Moule (or Pisano if you believe her facebook lies, also goes by Rachael Parkin), lives on Crafton Boulevard in Pittsburgh and loves cock, masturbating, and...that's about it. She works as a security guard at PPG Place in Pittsburgh which seems like an odd job for such a famous (sarcasm) female game reviewer. She probably thinks the uniform makes her look less like a butterface.

Fortunately,  with his e-penis of [[rape]] throbbing, this was the first thing Rob noticed about her, and continued to harass her demanding that she come over to his parents mansion, leave her husband and help him lose his virginity.  After Boo came to her senses and realised that Rob wasn't the [[A winner is you|true winrar]] that he made himself out to be, she promptly dumped his Skeletor ass.

During April of 2010, Robert, in a somewhat self-aware move, made a [[YouTube Poop]] video of his [[love|YouTube g/f]] [[stripper|bookittty182]].  Bookittty182, unable to comprehend "YouTube Poop", and being the sheer, absolute batshit crazy bitch that she is, retaliated by releasing intimate Valentine's Day videos she received from a [[delusional|naive, lovestruck]] Robert.

<s>It has all been taken down because bookittty182 and Rob made an arrangement: Rob had to take down his shitty "pookittty YouTube-poop" and bookittty had to take down the Silent Rob strip videos.</s> HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT. We have mirrors.

Rob wouldn't have any of this and threatened her with butthurt rants, abusive phone calls and blackmailing her with DOX.  So around this time of Rob's insanity, The Archfiend stepped in...

===SilentRob v. Angry Niglet===

{{quote|I'm a 15-year-old boy and one of your biggest fans.|[http://www.youtube.com/user/YoungFlame1377 Angry Niglet's YouTube Account]}}
Apparently Robert receives [[lie|hundreds of prank calls a day]] to his cell phone, but the straw that broke the camel's back was when a black person discovered his number and wanted to ring up his ginger idol.  He threatened to call the cops unless said nigger made a video apologizing and also a call to Bookitty.  This is one of Silent Robs many nigger drones.

==Rob Lowe and The Super Sekrit MEMBERS ONLY $5 Website!!!==
{{Quote|Hell, I even read a fucking comment where somebody said a penny is too much to charge for a gaming website, okay?<br><br>If...If.. you don't think my shit is worth a penny, Then FUCK OFF!!!<br><br>Okay, I'm not fucking dealing with this shit!|SilentRob,  Accepting constructive criticism from his [[Nobody|loyal following]].}}

After being rejected by Youtube for the umpteenth time to become a partner and suddenly coming to the conclusion that making multiple videos bitching about the fact had absolutely fuck-all effect on convincing the YT admins.  So, longing to receive substantial income for the first time in his life, Rob came up with a brainwave!  Why not leech off of his millions of Internet fans and create a website for his "premium content" videos instead?  All of his premium content consisted of him filming the top of his head with his bed in the background, as he talked about games. Watch out [[Video_game_reviewers#SpoonyOne|SpoonyOne]]!!!

But [[Snape kills Dumbledore|this story has a twist]]: '''He charges people $5 just to visit it'''. He has rightfully suffered backlash from his [[13-year-old|loyal followers]], finally seeing how shitty his work actually is. The ensuing lulz that has resulted from Silent Rob's butthurt and subsequent bawwwing about the website can be best described as the funniest thing that man has ever done:<br>

Please Note:  The majority of his "premium" content is exactly the same as his free Youtube content,  except he bitches about people who weren't gullible enough to pay for it.
[[Image:Satisfiedcustomer.jpg|thumb|right|Ok, so maybe uploading videos of yourself masturbating isn't what your pre-pubescent fanbase wanted to see...]]
===Criticism of His Website===
For some strange reason, his thousands of Youtube subscribers were not prepared to pay $5 for a site that contained the same low quality unfunny shit as his regular videos, so the disciples of Rob abandoned their messiah like rats from the ship, the S.S. whinging Ginger Pussy, after it hit an iceberg of a stupid fucking idea.

==So What are the Flaws to his Ingenious Super Awesome $5 Website?==

[[Image:RobThe SkinnyWigger.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This is the last angle we could take a photo of Rob from before he completely vanished due to his thin, gangly frame.]]

It's pretty obvious to a normal, sane human being, but we at [[ED]] like to explain concepts to our less intelligent readers (I.E. Robert Lowe).

* Noone, will ever '''EVER''' pay $5 to join a gaming website, unless you're immensely popular.  Which you are not Bobby.   Comparing yourself and your site to [[Something Awful]] is just sheer arrogance, you [[retard|fucking idiot]].

* If you're pissed about Youtube not you making a partner,  then why not fuck off to a video site that does pays for videos?  Like Blip or <s>Revver</s> Actually, don't bother with Revver,  they're fucking scam merchants, who never pay you what you're owed.  People don't mind adverts on videos or as banners on websites and they can then see your site for Free!

* The quality of your videos doesn't warrant a purchase price,  It may be worth something if you wrote out a massive script, hired multiple people to help film and act in the video and used expensive lighting and a $3,000 HD camera.  But You Robert are a buck-toothed <strike>Basement</strike> Attic Dwelling ginger fucktard who despite claiming how fucking rich you are, use a seven year old PS2 EyeToy camera that you [[hacker|hacked]] to work on your PC and a shitty $10 table mic from [[Target]], plus only use your crack-head house nigger boyfriend, Roach as an assistant.

* Finally, Your videos do not stand out from the millions of other shitty [[video game reviewers]] on Youtube or any other video website, most of whom do it as a hobby and are more than happy to put up the videos for free,  why do you feel yours are better than the others to warrant the purchase of a subscription?  Again,  it's all that massive ego you've got lodged behind those huge fucking Austin Powers teeth you've got in your head.

To this day, Rob has still not gotten over the butthurt of not becoming a YouTube Partner. Seeing the likes of the [[AVGN]], [[That Guy With The Glasses]], and [[Yahtzee]] [[Internet poor|making money hands over fists]], he has since gotten into [[internet panhandling]] by [[Geocities|creating his own website]] devoted to his poorly-made, unfunny [[abortion|abortions]] that he calls videos.

==Archfiend Comes To The Rescue==

Bemused by Rob's hypocrisy of making multiple sexist videos about beating [[wimmins|women]] and general hatred of the [[sex]],  but standing up against his fans about posting racist comments about his GameStop assault against an innocent African-American.   Pretentious douchebag and [[Goronchev]] rip off, [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|TheArchfiend]], decided to call out our dear Robbie in a series of slamming statements:

[[Image:SilentrobNES.png|thumb|250px|Right|This sums up the whole story]]
So by Rob's account, he is superior to Bookittty and TheArchfiend because:

* He has more subscribers than them. (YAH!)
* He is funnier and more entertaining.
* He fucked TheArchfiend's "sister" (even though he doesn't have one).
* He seys teh longer wordzzz.
* He has shocking evidence to shame and blackmail Bookittty with.
* [[????]]
* [[PROFIT!]]

== Prank Called ==

<video type="youtube" id="uNYx1BeKz4s" width="200" height="200" frame="true" position="right"/>
This dumb cunt actually talked to a Rosie O'Donnell soundboard for over 4 minutes. That's right ladies and germs, Rob was tricked into having a conversation with the same 10 soundboard clips 5 times. Why isnt this guy a success again?
{{quote|This is the wrong number I've told you five times that this is the wrong number.|SilentRob, Oblivious to the existence of sound boards.}}

== The SilentRobMobile ==

[[Last Thursday]], Rob shocked the Internets, by revealing to the world that he's the American Jeremy Clarkson with his expansive knowledge of 1980's shit-box cars.  

It's nice to show off to friends when you get a new car.  But sometimes,  when all your friends you think you have are on the internet ( and are also actually Trolls), plus the Car (sorry, CARS) you bought are a pile of shit.  Is it really worth it?

In Rob's case no,  no matter how petty the possession, it's still ego grooming for the man.  He even goes as far as calling it something as faggy like "The SilentRobMobile".

Look at my new car guyz!!!

Needing munnies to continue funding whatever the fuck he does all day long, Rob sadly had to sell his Cutlass Supreme, but being the excellent businessman that he is, swapped it for a 1985 Caddy instead,  Somehow he'd have been better off swapping it for some magic beans.

Of course, after many of his bitch-fests and falling from grace, his drama could be smelt by trolls from miles away, so for a while he became the whipping boy of the video game reviewer community.


{{quote2|yea no date gamers is pretty bad...it's one thing to talk﻿ shit and make parody videos, but at least make them funny... |Rob, in response to the hate}}

To acquaint with Rob's sense of humor, all parody videos contained constant swearing and childish mom jokes from that point forward.

==The Demise of LesiureSuitGaming==

[[Image:SilentFail.jpg|thumb|Right|SilentFail]]
On the 30th of August,  after all the trolling and generally making a fool of himself in public for the past few months, Rob did the [[DO NOT WANT|unthinkable]] and [[Delete Fucking Everything|closed his account]] and Super Sekrit $5 website, much to the annoyance of the [[morons|fans]] who actually stumped up the cash. Although, it was pretty obvious this would happen to the rest of the community when Rob didn't get the amount of subscribers he so arrogantly assumed he could accumulate.  No BAWWING video saying I'm leaving, or anything. This is possibly due to his dramatics, preferring a shock departure rather than a whiny goodbye.

So what now?  Considering that he's such an attention whore, chances are that Rob will come back sometime in the future, blaming the closure of his account either on Bookittty, or claiming that one of her many "cohorts" (I.E. friends of hers that he doesn't approve of Boo speaking to) hacked his account in true Armake style. 

Rest assured, we've not seen the last of Mr. Lowe, the mere sight of this very own [[ED]] page will send the man into a Tard rage of multiple butthurt videos.

'''So if you're reading this Robbie,  ED says Hi!'''

==The end of Silent Rob?==

On April 16th 2010 Silent Rob announced that he would stop making videos. For ever. The reason for this is obviously the "Premium Content", which was unveiled by bookittty182.
