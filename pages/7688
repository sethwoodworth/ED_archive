Not to be confused with [[trolls remorse]], '''sorry''' is the last refuge of an [[IRL troll]] when [[bribery]] is no longer an option.

'''Sorry''' in this context should never be confused with actual [[butthurt|sorrow]] nor is it an actual [[true|heartfelt]] apology, but is usually a [[the End|last-ditch]] attempt by the troll to save his or her job -especially when the troll involved [[black]]s and [[Al Sharpton]] and [[Jesse Jackson]] are calling for [[unemployed|your head]].

== The Six Stages of "Sorry" ==

This form of 'apology' is usually accompanied by:

# An immediate [[bullshit|hyperbolic]] press release spewing [[lulz|remorse]] issued through a [[liar|PR person]]. 
# An appearance on The Larry King show.
# Turning your life over to [[God]].
# Entering [[rehab]] of some sort (from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] to [[pot|Anger Management]]). 
# Meeting with the [[offended]] group in question.
# Suicide secondary to crippling guilt.
# [[????]]
# [[PROFIT]]!


It is extremely rare, however, for the offender to get beyond Stage 2.

== [[Lies|Saying Sorry]] on the Internet ==

Given that the internet has made IRL contact redundant, much to the pleasure of all [[basement dwelling]] [[virgin]]s who sit on their computers 24/7, new methods of apology have evolved.

Since no [[serious]] ED user has ever been observed apologizing for anything, completing this section is currently [[Obama|beyond our pay grade]].
