[[Image:Katawa Shoujo.png|thumb|right|The title for this [[Harem_Comedy|bishoujo-style visual novel.]]]]

'''Katawa Shoujo''' (“Cripple Girls”) is a [[dating sim]] created by [[Basement dwellers| a development group]] consisting almost entirely of [[Anonymous|4channers]]. Like all dating sims, the goal of the game is to [[Secks|befriend]] a wide variety of [[animu]] chicks.  Only in the case of this game, said bitches suffer from a plethora of [[win|horrible]] disabilities, including but not limited to…

*Being Legless 
*Being Armless   
*Being [[LOL WUT|Non-sequitur]]
*Being Deaf
*Being Loud
*Being [[unfunny|Funny]]
*Being Blind
*Being [[Animu]]
*Being [[Retarded|Intelligent]]  
*Being Female

So far only a demo has been spewed over the [[Internets]] so all information in this article only draws from it.  The full game was still under development by [[Faggots|Four Leaf Studios]] as of [[100 years ago]]. 

==[[Bullshit|Gameplay]]==
The object of the game is to get wasted off your ass, raped by another man, and fall off a school roof; this is achieved by [[Boring|clicking shit onscreen every half hour]] and wading through a lot of text. Failure to do so gets you stuck with a [[No|beautiful]] handicapped [[16-year-old girl|high school girl]].  This leads to [[HNNNNNNGGGGG|heart attack]] by way of [[Circumcision|prosthetic footjob]] or [[pwned|being rejected]]. When the full game is [[never|eventually released]], and if anonymous is true to form, this game will [[unrealistic expectations|cater to any and every fetish known to man]]. The final product is also likely to contain [[over 9000]] [[unfunny|in-jokes]] that only anonymous can truly [[lol|appreciate]].  

==Development and drama==
[[Image:We_love_our_fans.jpg|thumb|right|The KS forum also has its own brand of meta-fail: a fanart/fanfiction section where the devs show [[funnelgirl|their own form of appreciation]] for their fanbase.]]
The idea for the game came from a joke page drawn by the [[Japanese|Eleven]] artist "Raita". When the page was translated and posted on 4chan's [[Ronery|/a/ board]], Anonymous [[wat|loved]] the idea of a cripple-fucking game.  They immediately started outlining the main plot, all-important "[[rape|love]]" scenes, and [[Win|lulzy bad ends]]. A thread was stickied, a development team was formed, and a dedicated forum was made so they could more effectively <s>circle jerk</s> <s>share ideas</s> circle jerk. 

Then the [[drama]] began. Members of the team would join and [[ragequit]] for [[for the lulz|various reasons]]. Some were fired for spending too much time [[fapping]] and not enough time [[fapping|working]].  The [[High_School_Musical|plot]] was written and re-written and the [[Porn|art]] was drawn and discarded rapidly. But at last, on [[9/11]] an early development version of the first part of the game was leaked and discussed on 4chan; still, much [[fapping|work]] remained.

The name "Katawa Shoujo" was also a [[I_See_What_You_Did_There|boner]] of contention with the Japanese audience, since Katawa means "cripple" and is seen as [[butthurt|derogatory]]. The name was kept, however, to [[lulz|stay in touch with the artistic vision]] and because it was "[[lie|too late]]" to change it to something [[Goatse|inoffensive]].

During 2008, threads about KS would be quite frequently present on [[jp|/jp/]], causing much [[rage]] since the whole thing was considered to be [[Duke_Nukem|a massive piece of vaporware]], as well as many accusations of viral marketing by the game devs. This continues, to the point that now "being a KS dev" is a common [[Meme|accusation]] on /jp/.

In the spring of 2009, Act 1 of the game was finally released. After much nervousness about how the Japs would take a deliberate attempt to imitate their shitty games (as nerds are constantly seeking validation from one another), the Japanese reaction was neatly summed up in three words: "[[irony|SUBS FUCKING WHERE?!?]]" Meanwhile, back in round eye-land, the feedback forum consists mainly of posts saying stuff like [[Cocksucking|"this is the best visual novel I've ever played"]], which may be [[Truth|a sad commentary]] on the genre. It might, on the other hand, be an indication that the tastes of [[retards|basement dwellers]] are best understood by other [[sick fucks|basement dwellers]]. Because the devs forget [[Frienditto|everything on the internet is forever]], they frequently get butthurt when forum posters use dev blog entries and [[Furaffinity|dev-commissioned fanart]] to spoil plot tweests, calling all the clues obvious trolls.

[[Moot]] also changed /jp/'s name from "Japan/General" to "Katawa Shoujo" for a day during early summer of 2009, presumably [[Trolling|for the lulz]].

Shortly after the demo release, a KS forum [[Tartlet|devianTard]] named [http://studiomugenjohncel.wordpress.com mugenjohncel], allegedly a former artist turned millionaire businessman/importer/drug trafficker posted [http://ks.renai.us/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=1398 a beautiful drawing] of one of the heroines tied to a chair and stabbed to death with a pencil, then got b&amp; not for posting [[guro]], but ''for asking if it could be put in the devs' own [[Paheal|SUPER SPESHUL IMAGEDUMP SIET]]''. Being filthy rich and unencumbered by a day job, mugen failed to bitch about it anywhere, instead going on to start his own Ren'Py game where you get to [http://jpproject.2ksite.com/heavy-metal-girl-madonna-f12.html rape and murder a Mexican loli in the nuclear apocalpyse]. This was, of course, him wanting to be [[4chan|exactly like 4LS]] despite the absence of a modern setting in Japan, teenage girls, disabilities, or a staff of infighting manchildren producing it:

:<Delta_Kurshiva>	hahaha, he's whining for japanese translation
:<Blue123>	I thought he said he doesn't want to be like us
:<Delta_Kurshiva>	"big plans" indeed
:<Delta_Kurshiva>	oh, he wants to be exactly like us
:<Delta_Kurshiva>	only, /jp/ and everyone in the world thinks he's fucking aseome
:<Delta_Kurshiva>	and... it's him. Not us.
:<buckingham>	do we even have a decent japanese translation effort
:<Delta_Kurshiva>	Haven't heard back from them yet
:<Blue123>	Nothing has happened there for about a week or two
:<Delta_Kurshiva>	I would like to put forward that the translators are fucking lazy.
:<buckingham>	damn mugen would shit himself with joy if he knew we had a daily event centered around talkibg about him
</div>

==Major Characters==  
[[Image:Hisao.png|thumb|left|This is you, in many more ways than one.]]
*'''Hisao''': The vehicle the [[Wapanese|player]] utilizes to [[rape|interact]] with the rest of the cast.  His heart is too much of a [[Sephiroth|pussy]] to function properly so he must take teh [[Drugs|pills]] in order to keep from [[dying]].  His heart condition is bad enough that he is required to attend a special school to keep from dying, but not bad enough to prevent him from doing the horizontal hula with any girl that isn't Misha. That's a very specific degree of sickness. Because he is the main character, he has [[over 9000]] [[women|dysfunctional humans]] vying for his [[Penis|attention]] despite being a total faggot. 

*'''Emi''': [[LOL|Legless loli]] whose [[lame|confidence, self reliance, hyper, and sporty]] personality are major turn-offs to [[nerds|all]] who play the game. She is also a fast runner, but that's probably due to her using [[drugs]]. She has ran/jogged more miles than all of [[4chan]] combined, which is an impressive feat, considering that she’s [[animu|not even real]].  She's also a clueless cunt who needs to watch where she is fucking running. Despite being the loli, she is the least popular of the girls.

[[Image:Lilly_icwydt.jpg|thumb|left|[[I see what you did there|There are 3 puns here.  Can you SEE them all?]]]]
*'''Lilly''': A [[lie|quiet and well refined young woman]] whom you will eventually [[Buttsecks|butt-fuck]] in the full version of the game as she cheers you on, eliminating all charm she once had.  She gots no functional eyez for teh seein’.  Obviously some Jew stole her good pair. Boring as hell.

*'''Hanako''': A [[Azn|quiet book reading bitch]] who lusts after the player's [[shit|chocolate]].  She is [[Flame wars|burnt horribly on half of her body]].  Hopefully, the player will get a chance to  laugh at her ugly ass in the full version of the game.  She also enjoys playing chess, but [[blowjob|sucks]] because she is a [[woman|reclusive bitch]]. Hinata/Miyuki with burn scars. Is the most popular because she appeals to the worldview of white knight nice guys who believe being nice to girls automatically earns you pussy. Chris-chan's personal favorite.

*'''Shizune''': Some chick that is too fucking stupid to learn how to speak so instead uses her hands for making you sandwiches.  She is also the [[bitch|president of the student council]] and hopes that you will [[Stick It In Her Pooper|join her]] so she and her [[trap]] brother can [[raep]] you. She is basically Rei with Asuka's personality.               

*'''Misha''': Serves as a manbitch for the above character.  Her hairs' hobbies include [[Faux News|kicking reason to the curb]], doing the impossible,  using [[Gurren Lagann|stupid circular reasoning]], piercing the heavens, rowing, and fightin’ [[Party Van|da powa]]. Her disability is never mentioned in the demo because it will be a major plot twist in the full version when it is revealed that she has a [[trap|penis]]. In a devastating blow to people who like [[fat|big, beautiful women,]] it was revealed that she did not have a route. You'll have to put up with that blue haired bitch if you want to stick it in Misha's ass.

[[Image:Footjob.jpg|thumb|left|[[lie|A truly romantic scene]] that many fans envision will occur on Rin's route.]]
*'''Rin''': A teen with [[Wat|thalidomide]] arms and thus uses her feet to accomplish [[masturbation|every day tasks]].  She wears a boy’s uniform because she doesn’t want dudes peeking up her skirt at her [[Penis|vagina]], and also because she's a [[dyke]].  Fans like talking about how [[Retarded|deep]] and [[Intelligence|non-cliché]] this character is. Terrible choice for [[waifu]] because she cannot make you sandwiches without them tasting of athlete's foot. Bastard lovechild of Homestar Runner and Osaka. 

*'''Kenji''': A [[You|legally blind, misanthropic, conspiracy theory nut job]], with a deep rooted hatred of [[women|females]].  Needless to say, he is the [[Stephen Colbert|most badass mother-fucker ever]].  He also dispenses [[Advice Dog|timeless advice]] that should be held above even the highest [[moot|authoritative figures]]. He is seen naked before any of the females in the demo.  In fact he is the only person seen naked in the demo.  So playing this game makes you a [[furry|fag]].  Hell just reading this paragraph does. 

[[Image:1245174647617.jpg|thumb|FWI, Curtains also [[HACKERS ON STEROIDS|thwart 4chaners]].]]

==Fanbase== 
The fanbase consists of a bunch of [[fat|L33t]] [[virgins|romantics]], who play the demo despite there being no [[rape|love making]] visually depicted.  The full game will contain nudity and the sexings, but the developers promise [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|an option that allows players to skip any portions of the game involving sex]].  Players bring up this option with their parents when trying to advocate why the game is beautiful, and why they are [[Bullshit|not total perverts]] for playing it.  Lastly the fans of the game also enjoy arguing over which of the fucked up characters they consider to be their [[slave|waifu]], creating many lulz for really cool guyz (AKA fellow /v/irgins) viewing said [[ronery]] sadness.

Thinking about joining the Katawa Shoujo forums and discussing your [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|favorite cripple girl]]? Please make sure you enjoy the following before proceeding: The forums are cesspools for [[Irony|Devs so far up their own assholes they believe everyone but themselves are trash]], fucktarded users who post terrible photoshops and get their cocks sucked by the rest of the forum, and [[Sick fucks|retards who write terrible fan fiction]] about the burn girl getting her charred [[cock]] sucked by the deaf girl.

If you enjoy all those things, a forums account may just be the thing for you!
