Officially '''The Workers' Paradise''' or Koryo for short, is by its own standards standards the best country in the World, and the only country where taxes are nonexistent. The official currency is the Marlboro 20 pack, so even if [[faggot|you don't smoke]], you should take a lot of cigarettes to your [[BDSM|carefree]] vacation. 

Evildoer Korea is a pretty awesome country, much better than Gorea which is a US bitch. In fact, 46 out of 19 Goreans would love to suck an Americunt's cock.
 
The Capital, Pyongyang, has been ranked the Cleanest, Safest, most ordered City in Asia for the last 6 decades consecutively. Additionally it boast the lowest crime rate of the region, and homicides are almost nonexistent. Instead of the depressing, robotic, traffic lights you'd find in any other bustling metropolis, in the Capital of Paradise beautiful ladies wave colorful flags to direct traffic and every night the people vote to shut down electricity so as to reduce their carbon footprint, as well as appreciate the star-spangled sky. Healthcare, education and lifelong employment are rights ensured to all Koreans by their Dear Leader, whom they generally thank by building tall monuments to belittle foreigners with. 

But not all in the PDRK is urban hype, to the Northeast stretches the pristine mountain range that gave celestial birth to the Dear Leader, and while the area is closed to any foreigner, journalist or not, due to its sacred Geography; the State informs us that in the region beautiful ski slopes abound where workers spend their paid vacations drinking hot chocolate at their chalet. The State also informs us that the pictures of what would look like Concentration Camps in that same area as seen from Google Earth are actually shopped, another Western lie, and that in fact those pictures are of a [[Glenn Beck|FEMA camp]] near Anchorage, Alaska. But not to worry, the Dear Leader wants to win our affection and is already planning the destruction of the FEMA Alaska KZs with his mighty Typo-Dong. 

Due to the combination of a [[Communism|Stable Government]], [[Libertarian|NO Taxes]], [[Nazi|NO Crime]], [[Communism|Healthcare benefits]], [[No niggers|Clean Cities]], and [[Holocaust|Untouched Nature]], but somehow chilly winters, International Living Magazine has ranked North Korea as the number 2 favorite expat destination, [http://www.internationalliving.com/Countries/Other-Countries/America/Cuba/Country-Archive/cuba_trip2 after Cuba]. 

==Relationship with the West==

[[Image:NK soldier.jpg|thumb|North Korea is inhabited by short ugly goblins.]]
Not to be confused with [[Good Korea]] (or [[Gorea]] for short), Evildoer Korea is a founding member of the [[Axis of Evil]] and currently the [[United States]]'s main acquisition target in east Asia. Evildoer Korea is valuable in the United States' [[Manifest Destiny]] 21st century plan as it provides diversity to what would otherwise be an all-Muslim list of acquisition targets.

OK, [[Cuba]] isn't Muslim either, but it's really very small and most of the inhabitants already live in [[Florida]]. It's really just a rogue territory of the United States, anyway. Both Cuba and Evildoer Korea are on the list of countries to [[rape|spread]] [[capitalism|democracy]] to.

On July 4, 2006, North Korea launched its taepodong ("tapered penis") missile, which immediately got [[pwned]]. The U.S. responded [[Serious Business|by taking North Korea off its MySpace friends list.]] Quoting an unnamed top-level official, "Man, not cool. I told him not to fire that shit, so why does he always gotta be such a drama whore?" In retaliation, the U.S. launched a giant fucking rocket into orbit, just to show who's boss.

On October 8, 2006 (in [[America]] time, not theirs), Evildoer Korea reportedly conducted an underground nuclear test. Although the rest of the world had already [[defriend|unfriended]] Evildoer Korea, [[China]] had not-but that changed in an instant. However, the poor saps in the UN fail to realize that Evildoer Korea is a [[friends only]] country-meaning that, thanks to [[China]], the world has probably [[suicide|pwned itself]]. Way to go, commie bastards.

On May 25, 2009, North Korea announced that it had conducted a second nuclear test prompting outrage from countries all across the globe. The announcement came just after geological sensors in South Korea detected an artificial tremor. South Korea at the time was [[bawww|mourning]] some [[old_people|old guy]] who died, and thus was even moar [[butthurt]] than usual. According to the Russian Defence Department, the blast yield of the second bomb was between 10 and 20 kilotons, comparable to the size of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of WWII with the added irony that Hiroshima is the closest Japanese City to North Korea's Nuclear Capable Missile launch sites. When asked for the rationale behind such a provocative gesture, Mr. Kim simply responded, "I [[did it for the lulz]]". Rumor has it that North Korea's Nuclear weapons testing is actually a highly advanced form of [[IRL]] [[trolling]].

After the Japan shit bricks and South Korea went into [[rage|RAGECON 2]] the Kim decided to take the IRL trolling to another level after Obama and the [UN] filled his mail box with moar [[pussy|letters of condemnation]], Crazy Kim decided to dig up the 56 year old Armistice that more or less ended the Korean War, and burned it in front of the world announcing "Do something about it, try and stop me, I'll set off one in Seoul or Tokyo because bitches dont know about my nukes" later added "We will wipe out one third of the Japanese population for the lulz".

This immediately caused the U.S. to go from [[Serious business|DEFCON 4]] straight to DEFCON 2, whilst the Pentagon started to take North Korea seriously as the glorious nation it is and draw up plans on having to deal with a third war, with Clinton and Obama saying they aren't to accept A north Korea with nukes. Meanwhile in Japan, the nips have gone into total rage mode and stated they want nukes too so they can just Nuke Pyongyang themselves instead of waiting around while the U.S. sits twiddling it's thumbs as Tokyo gets nuked. This is apparently preferable to relying on the U.S. who keep pussy footing around North Korea as the U.S. is all talk and no action. Whilst all this was going on, Crazy Kim started to set up another Taepo-Dong 2 to test just to spit in the the UN, Japan, and the US's faces, and should launch by June 10th if everything goes well and North Korea hasn't levelled Seoul yet.

New news, Japan [[hurr|intelligence]] has found that the Dear Leader is planning to top off his recent [[lulz]]-spree by launching a 4000 mile range [[dong|missile]] at [[hawaii]], 4500 miles away... on the [[4th_of_July|FOURTH OF JULY]]. Everyone knows that nothing of value would be lost, but the idea of an attack on [[america|american]] soil is one that would cause the [[your_mom|middle-class whores]] of the states collectively shit their pants. This is clearly an attempt to break the all time [[IRL_troll|IRL Troll]] record, currently held by [[Adolf_Hitler|Hitler]] and his [[old|1940's]] attempt to cure the world of it's severe case of [[jews|jewdom]].

==The Next [[Fag|Deer]] [[Nazi|Leader]]==
[[Image:Kim_jong_un_basket.jpg|thumb|The next Queer Leader.]] 
[[Image:Kim-Jong-un.jpg|thumb|left|Can I nuke Hawaii? plz kthnx.]]
Kim Jong Il is indeed ill and has designated his youngest song Kim Jong Un to be Paradise's next leader after the cancer eats what's left of him and 8 thousand whooping cranes deliver him to Valhalla.

The ''Dear General'' who just turned 25 and has demonstrated a dedicated [http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=113583750 Fireworks Enthusiasm], will inherit a small arsenal of nukes. Some Conservative Extremists who can't understand [[Black_Jesus|Jesus']] doctrine of [[Afghanistan|peace]], would point out that having a spoiled teenager who likes fireworks having total control upon a country armed with nukes might render the West Coast in deeper shit than [[California|it already is]], but of course this is to be dismissed as the Right Wing Paranoia that it is.

==Geography==
[[Image:best_empty_korea.jpg|thumb|Google knows it.]] 
Evildoer Korea is immediately north of [[Good Korea]] and south of [[China]], limits with [[Russia]] to the northeast, on the top half of a peninsula that is west of [[Japan]]. It has water on both sides, and is probably a convenient place for throwing things into China, or to Vladivostok. It may also have some good surf beaches and shit, but we can't say for sure because they haven't been letting whitey -- or much of anything, for that matter -- into the country.   That includes food, information, or even decent TV programming, which leads for a pretty anti-lulzy lifestyle.

==People==
[[Image:Kpacheers.JPG|thumb|Why do it for the lulz when you can do it for the Dear Leader?]]
Millions of folks live in Evildoer Korea, but none of them make Samsungs or Kias. The government is too busy being evildoers, and the citizens are too busy starving to death or being shot in the head by government officials to be doing much of anything.

When the poor peasants do come out of their starving stupor, they often get together in small groups of seven and a half, usually with a small pack of kimchi, and try to cross the border into [[Gorea]], but mostly end up getting caught by the border guards because they talk too loudly while eating [[shit|kimchi]], then get sent back to Evildoer Korea for torture.

<center>MANY COMRADES LIVE IN PLEASANT PYONGYANG WITH THEIR 150 SQUARE METER APARTMENTS!</center>

==[[Government]]==
Evil Korea was founded by Kim Il-Sung who was a fucking superhero. When he died people rushed out into the streets and wept, then when thousands of cranes descended from the sky to collect his soul, they witnessed this and allowed his soul to watch over them and guide them forever. Now Kim Jong Il (an aging lesbian with a resemblance to Billy Jean King) is [[Pussy-whipped|in charge]]. He frequently uses his power to have Desperate Housewives DVDs imported to the country despite trade embargoes. Kim Jong Il's other pastimes include writing [[Shit nobody cares about|operas]] and ass-raping his male concubines.
<center><youtube>fiJRcLtsuq4</youtube></center>

==Economy==
Any productive activity is expressly forbidden by the Constitution. 
[[Pro_Ana|Healthier North Koreans]] must drill constantly for massive parades while the rest starve near unfarmed fields and abandoned factories.

==World Festival of Youth==
Glorious North Korea held the 13th World Festival of [[Loli|Youth]], which is pretty much a way for commie countries to exploit their citizens and encourage propaganda. The 1989 festival in Pyongyang was the largest to date, featuring citizens from 177 nations and about two million North Korean citizens pretending to be westernized and awesome.

== Did You Know? ==
[[Image:Kim Jong-il-Im an internet expert too.jpg|thumb|He's an internet expert, y'know.]] 
[[Image:Ugly south korean png.PNG|thumb|More proof of North Korea's superiority.]]

*That North Korea is actually run by Mr. Kim Il-sung, Jong-il's [[dead|deceased]] father, and the entire country still worships him like a God. When Kim Jong-il has to sign off on ''legislature,'' he has to sign it as Kim Il-sung. [[Crazy]] [[ass]] [[gook]]s. In fact, [[some argue]] Kim Il-sung, who [[almost raped|almost died]] due to his age and addiction to [[McDonalds]] was assassinated by his son, who succeeded the throne.

*That 95% of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer do not survive? Ruh-Roh Kim.

*If a North Korean looks a foreigner in the eye, he/she will be kidnapped and totured for life. This has proven difficult with [[Chinese]] tourists, since all azns rook the same.

*Though [[torture]] may be widespread in North Korea, it's carried out [[IDIFTL|only for the Lulz]].  Example: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms4NIB6xroc#t=18m00s North Koreans have a hard time concentrating, so they build camps.]

*North Koreans tell eachother "Dearest Leader Facts", since "[[Chuck Norris]] Facts" are banned.

*[http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2004/ea_nkorea_06_16.html Kim totally got 38 under par and five hole-in-ones in his first evar game of golf.] (Chance: 1 in 1,250,000)

*[http://conservative-salt.tressugar.com/Obama-vs-Kim-Jong-Il-Who-Greater-Leader-3020143 Kim bowled a score of 300 on his first time.]

*Kim is allegedly good at basketball. At 5'3", we can see why.

*Kim has a 10 inch cock, although he cannot see it when taking a piss

*The total ages of Kims four ex wives is less than 10 years old

*North Korea has no internets

== Mr. Kim is in trouble ==
Mr. Jong Il Kim is in trouble with the UN. The UN says that he is not allowed to import any more caviar, wine, and European chefs. He is also no longer allowed to import any more thirteen year old Chinese and Russian concubines. This was [[Japan]]'s idea because they hate Evildoer Korea. Mr. Kim is expected to starve to death without these basic supplies.


== Tiny Kim Adventures ==
[[Image:Longlive.jpg|thumb|From Pyōngyāng Studios: The newest state-licensed [[anime]], Juche-san and the Capitalist Pigs. Action guaranteed!]]
Why hasn't Kim Il Jong been taken out? If you live in Korea; deep down, you know you love this guy. From his kidnapping of a South Korean director in order to make Pulgasari (socialist giant monster furry porn)[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089851/]] to his kidnapping and brainwashing of Japs in a plan to make them zombie spies on their home country (instead of just using spies), the world delights in his plucky antics. Kim is a cartoon super villian brought to life and it makes the world just that little bit more magical to see him pwn millions. [http://www.robpongi.com/pages/comboKIMJONGIL.html watch the "Dear Leader video" to see him in all his mighty glory!]

Simply put, Kim does everything [[for the lulz]].
[[File:Kim Jong IL - for teh lulz.jpg|thumb|right|Kim has generated far more lulz than you.]]

Oh and what happened to those Japs he kidnapped and sent to spy on Nippon? After they returned to Great Leader with the latest animu, they were welcomed with open arms. After years of international diplomacy, Kim gave in and agreed to send their ashes and those of Jap soldiers who fought on the side of South Korea during the Korean War back to their families. 

Most of them.

LOL!

== Recent Arrest of two American Journalists ==

In the recent arrest of two Nitedstates journalists (azns), Current TV journalists Laura Ling and Korean-American Euna Lee decided to really fuck shit up  on planet earth after crossing the DMZ to paridiso North Korea. North Korea's government, which is on the fucking edge of the edge, just found their awesome alibi to kill the shit out of a few tens of thousands of people. Great Job!

Luckily for the young journalists, [[Bill Clinton]] had [[Yellow Fever]] and decided to take a private pleasure trip to North Korea with the objective of freeing them from their forced labor to give him a double dose of hot azn poontang.  All Slick Willy had to do was grease up Kim Jong Il's TAEPO-[[penis|DONG]], and they were all back on [[Al Gore]]'s jet fucking like bonobos before sundown.

== The Korean War Resumes (Almost) ==

It seems that recently, North Korea [[duh|might have been involved]] in [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8589507.stm the sinking of a South Korean ship], [[pwned|killing half of it's over 100 crew members]]. South Korea says that they will [[asking for it|punish North Korea for this incident]], and North Korea says that if that happens, [[serious business|it will mean war]].

Tensions are [[secks|mounting]] and technically [[OH SHI-|the Korean War never ended]]. Of course the South Korean army wouldn't be able to defend a sand castle, let alone all of South Korea, even though every citizen is required to serve for an amount of time. Eventually the [[US]] will have to intervene since there is [[Duke Nukem Forever|still unfinished business in Korea]]. 

Get ready to pack your shit out of the sand pit, asshole of the world Iraq, and come to the battlefield of North Korea, as that armistice is being thrown out the window. Who will win in this battle, will BEST KOREA's million man army topple the [[USA]]'s armed forces, or will Yoosa [[rape|wrestle]] North Korea into [[BDSM|submission]]? See it next time on <s>[[Dragon Ball Z]]</s> FUCKOO ZAT JAPANESU CURAPU!!!1111

== World Cup Defeat ==

[[Image:NORTH KOREAN PLAYER.jpg|thumb|North Korean soccer player after being raped by Portugal.]]
[[Image:Execution by hanging.jpg|thumb|North Korean team shortly after defeat.]]

On June 21, 2010, [[Portugal]] had [[pwnt]] North Korea 7:0 in their World Cup match, thus [[banned|permabanning]] them from the competition.
The humiliation had caused great [[Butthurt|butthurt]] for Kim Jong Il, who declared [[Jihad]] upon Portugal, <strike>and issued an order to behead all the north korean [[n00b]] players who made them [[Luser|the laughing stock of soccer fans worldwide]].</strike> They were mostly [[Japan|Japanese]] and [[Good Korea|Good Korean]] players paid to play on the NK team. Even the people in the stands were paid actors from china.

== Kim Jong-Il holding the World Ransom for 65 Trirron Dorrar ==
Butthurt from their World Cup loss, North Korea resumed their business as usual.  And by that, it means extorting money from the [[America|Western World]].  In rememberance of the 60th Anniversary of the Korean War, Kim Jong-Il thought it is about time for America to pay up...with interest...say [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/06/24/2936414.htm 65 trirron dorrar] to start with? (See: Austin Powers; Dr. Evil)  According to [[Wikipedia]] and the [[CIA]], the world gross domestic product is only $61 Trillon and America has a GDP of about $14 Trillon.

Upon hearing this demand, the world laughed at North Korea but the KCNA said they were [[serious business|serious]].

== HORY SHIT EVIR KOREA BOMBS GOOD KOREA ==
This just in evil Korea killed a good Korean and wounded several others with a [[Call of Duty|mortar strike gained by killing a good Korea boat]] a while back. Reports say it was done [[for the lulz]].

50 shells hit the island while most hit the water. the south then RAGED and fired 80 shells back.There have been 4 confirmed kills, 2 South Korean marines and [[LULZ|2 civilian casualties with 16 civilians wounded]]. 2 marines? No big deal that's only 100 minerals. Reports say that [[Kill it with fire|houses and mountains had caught fire]].

After news got around about the incident The north Koreans replied that [[NO U|The south fired at them first.]]
the UN and friends began to [[baw]] while the [[japs]] [[shit brix]] and [[Zerg Rush|began to prepare for any eventuality]].

Experts at the academy of political [[drama]] predict [[MOAR]] [[drama]] to develop in the coming days but will gradually begin to die down until the north gets bored and decides to [[troll]] the south some [[more]]. They predict this will happen some time during June-July 2011.

== Trolling people from North Korea ==

You can't, North Korea has no Internets ([http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,299757,00.html srsly],) unless you actually go there and try some [[IRL trolling]].
