'''Diet Pills''', also known as [[Drugs|weight loss enhancements]] are what [[pro-ana]] people are often obsessed with. There are currently [[at least 100|at least 100,000]] varieties on the market today; each claiming some [[science|scientific miracle]], while [[Truth|doing absolutely nothing at all.]] Most diet pills are made of recycled newspaper, guarana, sugar, water and other things "[[lie|specially formulated to help you lose weight]]". 

== Why use them? ==
There have been some great reasons as to why people use diet [[AIDS|aides]]. Some of them include:
* "[[Unwarranted self importance|I have to stay thin or I'll lose all my youtube viewers!]]"
* "[[Lie|My agent said if I didn't lose weight I'd get kicked off the show]]"
* "[[MySpace|I look fat in pictures]]"
* "[[Drugs|I just need an energy boost]]"
* "[[Unrealistic Expectations|My bf won't love me!]]"

== Fatties and Diet Pills ==
As the world is full of [[fat]] [[women]], the market is constantly reintroduced to diet pills and other supplements. Some famous weight loss posterfucks to sponsor diet pills:

* [[Rosie O'Donnell]]
* [[Anna Nicole Smith]]
* black person

== Prominent diet pill names ==
* '''Trimspa''' - The name implies that you're going to lose weight like you're in a spa, however after [[fact|careful research]], [[some argue|most agree]] that Trimspa did nothing, as it was compressed wheat.
* '''48 hour Hollywood Diet''' - This product gives you [[Tubgirl|the shits]] for 48 hours, removing 3-5lbs of waste from your body. Other than that, it simply exists to taste awful.
* '''Phenphen''' - [[B&|Banned]] from the market due to heart attack risk. [[LOL]] [[irony]].
* '''Alli''' - The only [[Government|FDA]] approved diet pill; blocks fats and carbs from entering your body, causes them to [[tubgirl|be shit out]] immediately. This pill is not a 'diet pill' in the true sense that it doesn't cause some miracle action nor does it make the weight melt away; however it [[AIDS|aids]] in weight loss.

== Alternatives to diet pills ==
* ''Exercise'' - Though unlikely to happen, physical movement is a surefire way to lose weight.
* ''Eating Habits'' - Again, unlikely; but a good way to lose weight. Put down the Ho-Ho and have a carrot, fat fuck.
* ''Socializing'' - An odd subject, but having a social life means you're more likely to get out and move around.
* ''Work/Labor'' - Again, our basement dwelling friends might find this difficult, but a good work ethic keeps the body happy, and more prone to weight loss.
* ''[[Amphetamines]]'' - the original (and best) diet pills - they made it impossible to eat and you'd do [[woman|all the housework]] and [[stfu|talk endlessly to your friends on the phone]]. And [[Downs syndrome| gurn like an idiot]]. "Oh yes Mavis, I've been a busy bee all day. These diet pills are lovely."
* ''[[An Hero]]'' - Last solution, but the best available. Doing this however will cause you to [[fat|need an extra large casket]].
