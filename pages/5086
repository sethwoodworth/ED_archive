MTLLEGION
== Legend ==

MTLLEGION, also known under an assumed name of "Conrad", was a legend in the internet metal community of the late 1990s-early 00s, perhaps only rivaled as top troll by ''Chris "Spinoza R. Prozak" Blanc'', founder of legendary mental masturbation site, the [http://www.anus.com American Nihilist Underground Society] or [[ass|ANUS]] for short. Conrad was a featured regular virtually everywhere on [[Yahoo]], [[IRC]], and [[AOL]], bringing a special brand of racially charged hate that went over like hot cakes. While claiming to own every album of all time, "Conrad" also gleefully claimed to assault people of color, never shower, and not have sex, but instead, rape. He disappeared somewhere around 2001, and was never truly seen again. 

== Influence ==

His style of all caps posting, interspersed with rapid fire degradating commentary and racially charged hate was and continues to be copied in virtually every metal forum to this day, even by those who were not aware of his existence nor around at the same time as him. The term "Clonerad" is often used to describe those posting in his style. 

A legend in his own time, some discussion continues to this day as to the actual identity of MTLLEGION. A person utilizing the name appeared in AOL sometime around 2004, however by all accounts he was not able to truly duplicate the original's success at trolling, and soon disappeared.
