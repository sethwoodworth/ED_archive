Opera Browser
'''Opera''' (pronounced '''[[Oprah]]''') is the only existing web browser created by [[Norway|Norwegians]]. Its trademark logo consists of a three-dimensional [[Goatse|big red "O"]]. It is now free, but no one on the [[internet]] noticed because they all pirated it anyway.  Users tend to change their skin as often as they check the homepage ([[over 9000]] times a day).  Opera is the most efficient way to browse the internet and quickly load [[porn]].  [[Norway|Opera developers']] mission statement is to cram as much crap as possible into one program.  Understandably, no body has any idea what the hell Opera is.

Using Opera is not suggested unless you are either [[gay]], [[retarded]], [[Norway|Norwegian]] or all of the above. This is probably not an issue since nobody actually uses Opera, making it the only browser less popular than [[links]].

==Opera Features==
*Fast, almost entirely inaccurate [[HTML]] rendering. But according to the [[monkey|developers]] it's the site at fault, not the browser.
*The ability to install custom themes and worksets. This is to create a massive cluttered window similar to [[IE]] users who install every toolbar known to man.
*It has the ability to make your friends think highly of themselves because they're much more [[gay|1337]] using an even less well known browser than [[you]].  
*Special voice playback technology that provides low quality text-to-speech, plus a 15MB download for functionality. It also causes Opera to freeze and crash. Really.
*It lets you look down your nose at people who use browsers that don't require them to program their own custom javascript just to block ads. 
*Mouse gestures. Opera will automatically go to [[Goatse]] if you move your cursor exactly three pixels to the left on odd-numbered months, but only if your name ends with an "e".
*Combines Internet Explorer's uselessness with [[Firefox]]'s [[fanboy|fanboyism]], plus tabs.
*[[IRC]]: Like [[mIRC]] with training wheels. It is not recommended to go on [[ED IRC]] using Opera.
*The scroll button locks up if you're not careful, then you have to do it manually, or restart Opera.
*Special "volume lock" which prevents you from muting your gay porn.
*Saving Sessions: Remember [[Last Thursday]] when you were [[masturbating]] to [[VG_Cats|Leo]]? Well now you can recall it.
*An annoying habit of opening the "About Opera" page in the current tab, causing you to lose whatever information you put into any forms on that page.
<!-- *After so long, Opera won't refresh whatever page you happen to be F5ing (probably something Snacks would take a while to ban), not that it likes to auto-refresh pages ''anyway'' (unless you tell it to, at set intervals).  The only solution is to move it to another tab, restart Opera, or uninstall Opera and get a real browser. -->

==Opera Troubleshooting==
If you are having trouble getting Opera to work, follow these instructions:
===Linux===
#sudo rm -rf / (You should be logged in as root, since that's the only way to really have control over your machine).
#Insert [[Windows]] XP CD.
#Don't save any partition space. 
#Install.
#????
#[[Profit]]

===Mac===
#<s>Go to /Applications/ and move Opera to the Trash.</s>
#<s>Under the Finder menu, select Secure Empty Trash (Always do secure delete in case some asshole wants to recover Opera in an attempt to play a cruel joke).</s>
#<s>Open Safari.</s>
#<s>Under Safari preferences, set the default browser to a non-Opera browser of your choice.</s>
#See steps 2-6 of Linux.

===Windows===
#Go to Add/Remove Programs.
#Select Opera.
#Click Remove.


===Alternative fixes===
*Get off the [[internets]].
*[[System32]] may need to be removed if you have not recently cleared it.


===Remove Opera browser completely===
*Right-click the big red O icon on your desktop that says "OPERA" select Delete, click Yes. DONE!
