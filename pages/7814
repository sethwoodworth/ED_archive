'''Steve Gumerungi Hodder Watt''' (a.k.a MC Dibirdi) is an Aboriginal from Alice Springs. Just like [[American]] [[niggers]] he has a [[lie|career]] in Hip-Hop rather than a real job and preaches the horror of racial intolerance every [[Sorry Day]]. After many years of training he somehow managed to lift his knuckles from the ground and learn how to use the interwebs. He got a nasty surprise.


===THAT'S RACIST!!1!===
[[Image:Watt-satire.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Not something they teach in remote child rapist schools.]]

Oh yes, did we mention he is Aboriginal? But we can't say anything mean about them ok, so let's be really nice about the child-raping, wife-beating, petrol-sniffing, white-bashing, alcoholic, welfare leaching under-race of Australia.

Steve stumbled across [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]'s article on the <s>indigenous people</s> cavemen of [[Australia]] in January 2010. Once somebody read the text for him he was [[shocked|shocked and appalled]] to find his people were depicted in a less-than-flattering manner and ordered that the site be removed from [[Google]]'s search engine. [[Racist|He naturally assumed the creator of this site is white]]. As expected Steve handled his outrage in a calm and reasonable manner by [[VIP|vandalising the Aboriginal article over and over again]].

{{squote|1=ED may have all the bite but at least by showing [[usi|I've got to them]], [[what|they have humanised the page instead of stereotyping our peoples as a whole]]. [[usi|By singling me out, they give Aboriginal peoples a name, face & story]], [[scroll up|not just racism disguised as sh**ty jokes & alleged 'satire']]. They may get more hits/mates but [[yes|will these gutless wonders ever show their faces or names]]?! I'd rather be labeled a [[what|'PC minority s*@tstirrer']] than be a gutless anonymous coward who hides behind the net using the web to talk crap, bite that!|2=Steve Hodder-Watt]|3=[http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/soa/Google-removes-Encyclopedia-Dramatica-link/0,130061744,339300442,00.htm?omnRef=http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=9&ved=0CCwQFjAI&url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/soa/Google-removes-Encyclopedia-Dramatica-link/0,130061744,339300442,00.htm&rct=j&q=encyclopedia%20dramatica%20article&ei=B0VUS4PcLIeisgOKn_yNCA&usg=AFQjCNEe0ONj0xZPzCJJx5pUG45AUAl4mQ&sig2=GXFF93Z3zZHOA89EPes0qA]}}


Sadly for Steve his victory was unfounded. He may have removed the Aboriginal article from Google, but after the [[ACMA]] drops none of ED will be available to anybody in [[Australia]] anyway.

===Why?===
Like all people who pretend to be oppressed Steve thinks [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is racist - overlooking the fact that ED treats all <s>races</s> people (and a few [[furries|non-people]]) with equal disgust. Also like [[Obama|all people]] who try to fight [[shit|racial intolerance]] Steve is the palest member of his family. We can therefore assume his [[butthurt]] antics are the result of [[white guilt]].

We at ED have had to add a new word to the lexicon to describe Mr Hodder-Watt - Waboriginal. This describes the strange phenomenon of a white man calling himself Aboriginal, much in the same vein of a white man calling themselves Japanese (see: [[Wapanese]]). Could this be due to [[liberal guilt]], or the result of an intensive breeding program to improve the gene pool? [[It is a mystery]].

==ED Vandal==
[[Image:Bunbajeevandalism.png|center|thumb|900px|JUST MODIFYING THE ENTRY DON'T MIND ME!]]

After being shown by a white fella how to operate a computer, old '''Stevo''' loaded up Google and attempted to discover what being an Aboriginal was all about, due to the fact his skin reveals his is less than octroon in Aboriginality, a Waboriginal if you will (portmanteau of White and Aboriginal geddit?). Where was I? Oh yes, so '''Bunbajee''' searched for "Aboriginal AND Encyclopedia", and was kindly directed to the Encyclopedia Dramatica page. Lacking the intelligence required to comprehend satire, he proceeded to shit his pants and blank the page, replacing it with [[Lies|"The True Owners of the Lands!"]]. The irony of the fact that Aboriginals do not believe in land ownership seem to be lost on him, nevermind the fact that Aboriginals have no claims on their Encyclopedia Dramatica page.

'''Stevie Wonder''' then called his [[lawyer]] who works for legal aid, who likely advised him that ED is an [[America]]n website, of which Australia has no jurisdiction over, and of which the US Constitution covers with this thing called the 1st Amendment. Not content with this legal advice, he then contacted the media and Google, who frowned on ED's shenanigans. Google took the action of G-lining the page, whilst the Australian media raped ED in every orifice, allowing readers to write letters expressing their moral outrage that a bunch of nerds can be SO RACIST.

A report was filed with the Australian Human Rights Commission too. How a piece of satirical writing is in violation of anybody's human rights is beyond our comprehension, however their claim was accepted by the Australian crybabies.  And everybody knows Abos aren't even human anyway.

==Media Outrage==
[[Image:Stevehodderwatt.png|thumb|right|250px|GET OUTRAGED]]

[[Austria|Australia]], which is conveniently missing something called a "Bill of Rights", does not have freedom of expression. The fact that such a website exists boggled the minds of the Australian public, whose short-sighted intentions include lynching brown people, drinking beer and "getting a root". Unfortunately, pages such as [[Jews]], [[White People]] and [[Blacks]] were not shown to the [[LOL|journalists]] at Fairfax Media, so they passed off what was blatant satire as "RACISM".

===Twitter===

As SMH accepts comments on stories via [http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23fdmaxd Twitter], it is interesting to see the parity between responses of the technolgied fifth-estate, and the the unwashed plebs who read their newspaper in inky rag form.

|Although I disagree with whats on Dramatica, if we are going to go down the path of censoring everything we disagree with like conroy wants we will end up being no better than China. Who will we be then to lecture them about press freedom and internet censorship?

==Asking For It==
[[Image:Stevehodderwattchild.jpg|thumb|right|250px|You gonna get raped]]

Our panel of [[User:Weev|pundits]] and [[Noone|political experts]] here at ED have suggested that perhaps '''Bunbajee''' was not so outraged at the article in the first place, and was rather using this as an attempt to catapult up the ranks of the Australian media. It seems odd that he would be searching for an encyclopedia entry on his own race, as if he was looking for bias or controversy. Once he found the article, he proceeded to contact every relevant authority, as to get maximum coverage. Furthermore, digging into his history has proven that he is an attention whore, always looking to expose his career, life and beliefs.

==He gets Google to ban more pages==
Not content with just one page banned, he's started a huge campaign for Google to ban all pages that are racist or persecute. [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/18/2795016.htm]

His next target is getting all [[furry]] articles on ED banned from Google for [[fursecution]]!

==He ignores the real racism from KFC's commercials==
[[File:Aboriginal Fursecution Fox.jpg|280px|thumb|His totem the dingo stands up for his race. NOTE: The dingo is actually much darker than Steve himself.]]

Now Australia, the [[United States of Australia/Advance Australia Fair, Not Yellow|birthplace of Hitler]] (no he was not born in Germany), has lots of real racism.

|Now Steve actually went worldwide to stop Encyclopedia Dramatica, but he didn't go worldwide to stop racist KFC ads mocking Abbos. Here's another of their racist ads, that aired in the country of [[Gorea]]:

[[Shit nobody cares about|IGNORE THIS. Firstly, these ads have nothing whatever to do with australian aboriginals, they are about the West Indies, with which Australia plays cricket. Secondly, these ads have nothing whatever to do with racism. The "black people = fried chicken" meme is entirely American - this was an australian ad for australian viewers. That connection just isn't there. Australian aboriginals are not american negroes, and neither are west indians. Americans don't get this, because they are very ignorant and have only one word for anyone with dark skin. Aboriginals are not australia's niggers, they are austraia's red indians.]]

==Rapping Career==
'''Bunjabee''', like lots of angry black people, enjoys spitting <s>fat</s> PHAT rhymes to the noise of the electric boogaloo. Unfortunately, his rapping careers has not taken to the dizzying heights of [[Kanye West]], however [[some argue]] '''MC Dibirdi''' is the voice of a generation, a lyrical wordsmith if you will.
<center><youtube>LauBtzgGg0Y</youtube><br>Steve bustin rhymes and teaching kids about the fun of firearms</center><br><br>

His playlist of 3 songs and one long diatribe regarding the impiety of the white race can be found [http://sharebee.com/4c7ab46f here]. 

As well as rapping into a cheap computer microphone and using the cheapest authoring software available, he can also be seen on some [[old media|ABC television show]] teaching kids how to hate white people, and futhering his revisionist historian lies.
How nice of you to spend your free time harassing small businesses, shouldn't you be studying or something?

|Hip-hop style - it's something that Indigenous children can relate to, because music has always been an essential part of Indigenous culture. It doesn't matter which tribal grouping or area you're from. That's something I've used. That's a craft that I've developed myself, having not had a cultural connection to my homeland in Mornington Island. Now fuck off ya white cunts and get off me land.

==Raping Career==
[[File:Rape-image2.jpg|thumb|150px|A typical night in with the Hodder-Watts]]
Like <s>many</s> <s>most</s> all aborigines, our Steve has had a long and illustrious career having crazed petrol-fueled surprise sex with the younger members of his tribe. However, as aborigines as not actually human beings, these acts cannot legally be classified as rape. In fact, such acts of sexual aggression have been vital for the very survival of the aboriginal species, as under normal circumstances no male (human or otherwise) would allow his wang to get anywhere near one of their hideously [[Ugly#Fugly|fugly]] females.
