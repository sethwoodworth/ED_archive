Coincidence
{{pixpls}}

A '''coincidence''' is actually a [[conspiracy]] without the "[[????]] [[You]] decide!" at the end of it. Simply by adding "??? You decide!" any coincidence becomes a [[MONGO|government]] conspiracy carried out by the [[JEWS DID WTC|Jews]].


==Examples==
===[[Not]] coincidences===
*4000 Jews didn't show up for work on [[9/11]].
*All [[LJ]] users are [[fags]].
*Most of the [[Katrina]] victims were black person.

===Coincidences===
*4000 Jews didn't show up for work on 9/11. COINCIDENCE??? [[faggot|You decide]]!
*All LJ users are fags. COINCIDENCE??? [[retard|You decide]]!
*Most of the Katrina victims were black. COINCIDENCE??? [[faggotry|You decide]]!
*[[Nathan Keefer]], [[Nathanr]] and [[Nathaniel Nurnberg]] are well known pedophiles. COINCIDENCE??? [[You]] decide!

==Variations==
A common variation uses only [[one]] "?" and ends in "I think not!" instead of "You decide". This version is for [[lamers]]. [[penis|Real men]] use the "You decide" version.

Actually, I take that back, anyone who uses EITHER version is not only a lamer but a [[fucktard]], too. But using the original version at least makes you [[less than three|less]] of one.

==[[You]] decide!==
Remember, you decide! But if your decision happens to be that [[WTC|it]] was, in [[fact]] a coincidence and not a conspiracy, you are a [[retard]] sheeple brainwashed by the government and a complete [[moron]] and should [[An hero|kill yourself]].

But, you STILL decide!
