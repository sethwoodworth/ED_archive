Chakichakigirl, or "Dee" is an [[anime]] [[fangirl]] with a [[suck|penchant]] for [[fanfiction]]. A self-proclaimed "authoress", [[Bill Nye|scientist]], and "[[Colorado#Boulder|Boulder]]-transplant", she currently resides at [[FanFiction.Net]]. Chakichakigirl is obsessed with [[lolicon|little girls]], [[incest]], [[science|SCIENCE]], and [[death|dead people]]. She is currently under the delusion that she is an [[internet celebrity]]. She believes that bad reviews are [[Sexual Harassment|sexual harassment]], that anyone who hates her fanfiction is a stalker with the hots for her, and that people who don't review fanfiction are on [[welfare]].

It is important to note that Chakichakigirl is completely [[batshit]].

==History==
[[At least 100 years ago]], a disoriented crack whore was torn a new one as Chakichakigirl (Dee) burst forth into an [[reality|unwelcoming world that HATES WOMENS.]] With no mother, she and her brother were raised on SciFi channel, anime, and [[Mcdonalds]] [[diabeetus|french fries]]. As Dee's brain inevitably decayed, she easily found herself [[almost raped]] one night by an [[Bleedman|internet pedophile]]. (Later discovered to be [[Michael Jackson]] after seeing [[Furfaggotry|The Wiz]])  This immediately set her [[feminist]] fanfiction move into action, and Dee blossomed into a [[disturbed|fabulous]] fanfiction [[What|AUTHORESS]].

Since no fanfiction author can exist without [[original fiction|existing fiction]] to whore off of, Dee quickly had to find a show that was empowering to women on a global basis.  Being partially raised on [[Japan|Japanese]] [[porn]] led Dee to consider both "Powerpuff Girls Z", the retarded animu version of [[The Powerpuff Girls]], and "[[Lucky Star]]", a [[loli]] show aimed at 40 year old [[men|male]] [[virgin]] [[basement-dweller]]s.  One [[semen|ejaculation]] later, her first fanfiction appeared on the [[internet]].

==Fanfiction==
Dee's fanfiction is one of the saddest collections of [[sad]] on FanFiction.Net. Dee has not seemed to realize that Lucky Shit is a boring show about [[nothing]] for [[fat|overweight]] middle-aged [[pedo]]s with nothing better to do than to watch animated schoolgirls talk, and thus writes horrible [[science fiction|sci-fi]]-based [[insanity]] in an attempt to keep things "[[Rule 34|interesting]]". Her interpretation of the English language is very [[I'm so confused|unique]]. Be warned: reading a fanfic by Dee may require a full day of bedrest to recover from overexposure to [[bullshit|total fucking bullshit]]. Dee's fanfiction may consist of any three or more of the following:

[[Image:Typicaldeefan.JPG|thumb|A typical Chakichakigirl [[fantard|fan]] leaves a review.]]

*[[Pedophilia]]
*[[Necrophilia]]
*[[Guro|Schoolgirls that mutate into giant bug monsters]]
*[[Faggotry]]
*[[Emo|Characters hating themselves for their faggotry]]
*[[Alien]]s
*Walls of text
*[[Completely out of character behavior]]
*[[Star Trek|Senseless techno-babble]]
*[[Bullshit|Real science]]
*[[Incest]]
*[[Over 9000]] exclamation points
*The word "UNREAL"

Dee has a never ending [[erection|hard-on]] for the only [[zombie|dead]] character in the Lucky Star cast, and has written multiple creepy as hell stories about her. Despite the character's profile stating that she was 28 at the time of death, Dee knows better and insists that she was actually underaged pedobait (makes for better [[rape|rapefic]], amirite?).  Despite the fact that many of Dee's stories incorporate lolicon girls having sex with their sisters, graphically turning into disturbing aliens, or being sexually abused, [[lol|Dee will go on a moral tirade whenever pedophilia is mentioned, implying that it is something that she won't stand for]].

Dee believes that her [[shit|exalted works]] are not fanfics, but are in fact light novels (professional publications) and doujinshi (fan-made comics). Dee is too fucking retarded to know the retarded terminology of her own retarded fandom.

By the way, Dee has an [[iphone]].  It’s [[sad|very important to her image and self-esteem]] that we all know that Dee has an iphone.  It is mentioned on her profile and in [[loser|every fic she writes]].  Have you heard of the iphone?  Did you know that all of her fics are composed entirely on iphone?  Wow!  UNREAL!

===Dee's Forum Adventures===
[[Image:deekissesass.jpg|thumb|Dee sleeps her way to the top at various animu forums.]]

Eager to [[prostitute|show her work to literary connoisseurs]], Dee wasted no time in joining as many [[animu]] forums as possible to start whoring.  What followed were [[over 9000|many, many]] posts full of insanity, [[AIDS]], and general [[WTF]].  Helpless virgin [[nerd]]s and [[geek]]s across the [[intertubes]] had their eyes [[raped]] by:

*Everything followed up with a friendly reminder to [[DO IT FAGGOT|READ THOSE GOD DAMNED FANFICS, FAGGOTS]].

In the wake of this [[fail|rousing campaign]], Dee was eventually chased off of most forums she had joined. Apparently, she had been enough to annoy even the [[hard]]est [[loser]] [[fanboy]] of animesuki. Dee was [[butthurt]] but recovered, until...

[[Image:Cryingman.jpg|thumb|The internet’s reaction to Dee’s failure to commit e-suicide.]]

===Dee Nearly Becomes An Hero===
[[Last Thursday]], Dee noticed that [[OH NOES|her review to pageview ratio was very low]]. This was most likely due to her fanfiction's tendency to leave readers braindead and unable to type. Seething with righteous fury, [[BAWWWWW|Dee cried the tears of ultimate sadness]] and announced that she was [[ragequit|LEAVING FF.NET FOREVAR]], unless she got moar reviews. Shockingly, [[nobody gives a shit|no one gave a shit]]. [[Idiots]] who wanted to keep exposing themselves to her radiation could join her "[[spam|mailing list]]".

{{quote|<small><small>It's not an action I'm happy about, but with a [[shit nobody cares about|feedback ratio of 1 review per 30 hits]] out of several hundred I'm forced to reward those who have graciously critiqued OR flamed my stories and not reward non-reviewing literary [[welfare]] deadbeats with further free entertainment off my time. If you're SO lazy that you can't even tear one minute of your bother to jot a brief review or even a flame to receive entertainment free of charge then you're not my kind of (slackered) person anyway - sorry to be so blunt. Those who have reviewed my work please send me your e-mail address via Fanfiction's private message where you want further chapters of my stories and future doujinshi mailed to.</small></small>|Chakichakigirl, [[asking for it]]}}

(The above comment was [[baleet]]ed but saved for great justice)

[[Fail|Dee's epic departure lasted all of 2 weeks]], to the great sadness of the internet.
[[Image:ClovershoopDee.gif|thumb|Dee’s usual reaction to a critical review.]]
[[Image:carpingtrolls.jpg|thumb|NEVAR GIVE IN.]]

==Chakichakigirl’s reaction to CRITICISM==
As shown in the above quote, Dee was so [[comment whore|desperate for reviews]] that she outright begged for [[flame]]s. [http://www.fanfiction.net/r/4560347/0/2/ and] [http://www.fanfiction.net/r/4184788/ the readers] [http://www.fanfiction.net/r/4636859/ delivered].

Naturally, Dee went completely [[apeshit]] over this.

{{quote|<small>Carping trolls have a great hand in bringing down Fan fiction as a forum for fiction and greatly discourages fledgling writers who only wish to strut their stuff un-hassled. Unfortunately trolls see that as open season to show what brains they are. "My" particular troll(s) obviously hold some long personal grudge with me which I'm not going fathom or entertain.</small>|Chakichakigirl, showing what brains she is.}}

[[Image:Im_a_carp.jpg|thumb|left|120px|The Enemy]]

{{quote|<small>To the person who I suspect is spamming me with harassing posts. I am more than pressing the delete button on your zealous messages, which are bordering [[Sexual Harassment|sexual harassment]] and I've reported it as such to FanFictionNet who take such reports [[serious business|VERY seriously]]. You will be traced and exposed not only here, but I'll make sure also on LuckyStarFans and AnimeSuki where you haunt. [[lie|I can take criticism]], but I won't take harassment.</small>|Chakichakigirl, [[lulz|very serious]]}}

[[Image:OH SHIT, GADFLY.jpg|thumb|Dee's Kryptonite, [[Azn|Gadflies]]. It's a good thing there are billions in Colorado]]

Dee's retaliation began with labeling bad reviews as sexual harassment. All those who left bad reviews were labeled with her new fun-phrase, "carping trolls", or they were [[sexist]] [[stalker]]s who were [[epic lulz|jealous of her awesome writing prowess]] (and fandub!). [[sarcasm|This was a courageous move for women everywhere]] as Dee paved the way for all female writers into the respected, [[16 year old girl|male-dominated]] profession of fanfiction writing.

[[Image:Caught.PNG|thumb|<s>Chakichakigirl</s> Maxlance to teh rescue!]]

Along with [[Trolls|Carp]], Dee's other major enemy includes the elusive, sneaky [[Azn|Gadfly]]. [[Last Thursday]], too many [[Flames|Gadfly "Nibbles and Quibbles"]] caused her [[lie|to block off her anonymous reviews from the website and only let people read her stories through e-mail]]. 

[[Image:Gadfly.PNG|thumb|Dee's [[butthurt]] cry about gadflies]]

===Sockpuppets===
Fortunately for Dee, she was no longer alone on the front against these malicious [[crap]]. Joining her was an army of anonymous fanfic reviewers who would rebuke nearly every bad review left on her stories. Suddenly, the girl who had to leave FF.Net forevar for a lack of reviews had a viable legion of anons at her every beck and call! These defenders of Dee not only worshiped the ground she walked on, defended her stories down to the tiny details, and agreed with all the claims of stalking and sexual harassment - they also talked exactly like all of the characters in Dee's fics! [[sarcasm|Wow]]!

Dee has a [[sockpuppet]] for all of her multiple [[dick|appendages]]. Sometimes, Dee forgets to sign out before sockpuppeting. Oops!

Her [[sockpuppets]] consist of: Fictioneer, 8th Man, Maxlance, electric-ashes, anonman, Lance1, and Narcowhacker.

[[Image:8th_Man.gif|thumb|8th Man, one of Dee's most oft used and pathetic socks, displays his [[retard|skills]] against a well-composed review.]]

Believing the entire internet to be [[stupid]], Dee hotly denies any claim of sockpuppeting. She says that [[lie|all of her anonymous defenders are true signed authors who are fueled with the burning rage of great justice]], but afraid that posting will make the "trolls" target them next. So Dee graciously posts anonymous reviews FOR them. [[Srsly]].  A common pattern of gender [[fursecution|persecution complex]] can be seen:

[[Image:Babe_dude.jpg|thumb|left|8th Man is proof that Chikichakigirl has never heard a man speak outside of cheap 80's [[cartoon]]s.]]

{{quote|<small>you just like beating up on girls?</small>|Sock#1}}

[[Image:Find_the_sock.gif|thumb|left|Dee attempts to sockpuppet-pimp on Lucky Shit imageboards, with [[pathetic|hilarious]] results.]]

{{quote|<small>Be a real man and move on and stop pissing on everyone's party</small>|Sock#2}}
{{quote|<small>dude, if you don't like her stuff then be a MAN and just MOVE ON like stealth! </small>|Sock#3}}
{{quote|<small>If it's not your thing, then do the gentlemanly thing and walk on without an ill word please. </small>| Chakichakigirl}}

Only [[Star wars kid|real men]] visit fanfiction.net. Clearly, you have no place here.

===Fictioneer===
[[Image:FicsGEESE.jpg|thumb|Fictioneer delivers an inspirational message.]]

An unknown entity (including gender), Fictioneer is possibly the most [[sad|lulzworthy]] thing about Chakichakigirl. It is [[fact|widely believed]] that Fictioneer sprung from the depths of Dee's [[anus]] one night while she was taking a [[shit]]. Since she couldn't afford to [[buy a dog|get a dog]], Dee decided to train Fictioneer into her personal [[Internet Tough Guy]] to protect her from those pesky trolls. [[EDiots|Top Psychologists]] speculate that [[truth|Fictioneer's posts are even more confusing and batshit insane than its master's]]. Know that whenever Fictioneer arrives to engage a carping troll in battle, there are [[LULZ]] to be had.

[[Image:Anontellsit.JPG|thumb|Anonymous tells it like it is.]]

No matter how harsh or how civil the reviewer is, Fictioneer will be sure to [[fail|bring them to justice]]. At its arsenal are [[wank|freedom of expression]], [[engrish|total fail at coherent language]], and words like "GEESE".  Fictioneer knows that Dee's fanfiction review ratio will directly affect the overall safety of the intertubes, and Fictioneer alone stands between every [[Nazi]]-[[pedo]]-[[DBoyWheeler|stalker]] out there and its master's [[waaambulance|sensitive ego]].  Because Fictioneer will constantly and violently encourage Dee's delusions, be assured that Dee will never improve as an author (but will always be lulzy) as long as he/she/it is around.

[[Image:Uncensored.PNG|thumb|Fictioneer [[ALL CAPS|UNLEASHES THE FUCKING FURY!!!]]]]

In moments of [[BAW|extreme anger]], Fictioneer will proceed to [[Furry|take off all of its clothes and transform into a raw, '''UNCENSORED''' form of itself]]. Despite not understanding the [[internets]], this does not keep it from complaining and defending its [[BDSM|master]].

{{quote|<small>this guy and several other trolls like him who seem to harbor a deep sicko _[[paranoid|persona]]l_ grudge against this[[woman|woman author]]. I'm [[serious business|serious]]. They follow and needle anything she does and make a mountain of crap out of minor details meant to be off-the-wall. It's definitely a personal, not a artist criticism thing and anyone can read that in their comments [ [[hypocrisy |if they're not the same person]] ]. You; and your jerk clones should [[What|take your sour toys and go home]]. You're like a guy who barges into someone's party, sits in a corner and [[fart]]s and [[shit]]s over the place, and happy that you ruined everyone's party you go home. Your 'reviews' ain't reviews; they're just an excuse to piss on a woman who's done [[poop|squat]] to you all. WTF is your hang with ChakiChakiGirl?? You [[lulz|hate smart women]] or can't get over being dumped by one or is your [[censorship| _]] too tiny or what? I've read Dee's reviews to other stories and she [[handjob|strokes]] the worst writer instead of shitting on them like you all do. She has the grace and guts to say nothing down on anyone, and that's rare here in FF. Really, dude, if you don't like her stuff then be a MAN and just MOVE ON like stealth! We're all TIRED of hearing your personal rants! [[Jesus]]!!</small>|Fictioneer, [[internet tough guy|hardened internet warrior]]}}

It is also [[fact|quite possible]] that Fictioneer is nothing more than Chakichakigirl's most epic sockpuppet to date.

8th_Man is the only other significant [[sockpuppet]] of Chakichakigirl, who manifests from [[tranny|her]] repressed [[cock]].

==How to Troll Chakichakigirl==
*Tell her that her fics suck because chicks can't write good sci-fi.
*Mention her homosexual ass-slave relationship with Fictioneer.
*Say that you hate her fanfiction because you know her from high school, you know where she lives, and you're coming to have sex with her.
*Accuse her of being a necrophiliac pedophile and tell her that her obsession with loli zombie Kanata proves it.
*Link her to [[Lucky Shit|this]] article.
*Tell her that Lucky Star is a show for men.  [[gtfo|Get out]].
*Tell her that there is no scientific basis for anything in her fics.  Provide facts for extra lulz.
*"Grandma always said, women need to get out of the workplace and back to the kitchen!"
*Leave a long, detailed review calmly stating why her story is shit.  This will definitely bring Fictioneer out.
*Spam "Don't let carping trolls get you down!" on her review pages at least 100 times.
*Explain to her the difference between fanfiction, doujinshi, and a light novel.
*Remind her that Kanata is fucking dead.
