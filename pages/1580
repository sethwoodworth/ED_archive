Chuggaaconroy
[[Image:Chuggaaconroyintheflesh.jpg|thumb|Chuggaaconroy in the flesh. (Picture above is not actually Chuggaaconroy, but a characterisation of what he is believed to look like. He is so egotistical he wears a mask to hide his facial features whenever he is filmed [[IRL]].]]

<b>Chuggaaconroy</b> is an [[unfunny]], annoying, [[aspie|autistic]] who does shitty [[Let's Play]]s on [[Youtube]] which are horrendously boring to watch and listen to. 

In every single one of his over-produced videos, "Chugga" (as commonly named by his [[13 year old boys|pre-pubescent obese fanboys]]) constantly repeats the same old unfunny [[Youtube Poop]] quotes, and spouts out the same vacuous phrases at the end of every sentance. Seriously, get a pen and paper, choose any one of his videos of him playing [[nintendo|shitty nintenda games]] and make a tally of how many times he says either one of these three phrases, as it will shock and appaul you that he has somehow become a youtube partner: <b>"Whatever"</b>, <b>"I Dunno"</b> and <b>"Ok, so yeah"</b>. [[at least 100|The total number should be somewhere in the hundreds]].

For anyone with the mental age higher than two, his "humour" is excruciatingly painful to listen to, made only worse by his [[redneck|stupid hick voice]]. Chugga has a very large fanbase, considering how untalented he is. He acts as if his videos are like Game Walkthroughs and will help those who may be playing along with Chugga himself. Yet, he seems to only play games which are always at least 10 years old, which raises the question of [[losers|who the fuck would be playing them?]]

==Videos==

Chuggaaconroy started making videos early in 2008. He coins the phrase "Let's Play" when referring to his videos, yet this is not exactly true. You are not included in the playing of whatever game he chooses to play, therefore it is not "Let us play". It should more likely be called "Watch me play", or in the case of Chuggaaconroy: "Watch an [[autistic]] play a crappy [[nintendo]] game badly". A lot of other "Let's Players" make this mistake.    

===First Video===
His first video is posted below and is a complete travesty and was just an omen for all the shitty videos he has went on to make. Recorded with the [[sarcasm|greatest screen-recording camcorder of all-time]], Chuggaaconroy gloats about he beat the [[lolwut|2nd hardest difficulty]] on [[Super Smash Bros|Supa Smash Bros Bawl]]. Almost completely inaudible  and unwatchable due to the shitty voice recording and the [[fail|constant moving of the camera]], this video is the [[you|epitome of fail]]. It is rumoured that this video can cause sufferers of [[epilepsy]] to have violent fits of rage.

===Let's [[fail|Play]]===

[[Image:AFAIL.png|thumb|Super [[Mario]] Galaxy is Chuggaaconroy's most recent LP, and it is literally unwatchable due to the fact that he dies every five seconds.]]

Chuggaaconroy has made a number of shitty LP's over the past couple of years. He uploads one video a day which used to be a 10 minute part of his let's play, but since recently getting a youtube partnership, his videos have an average length of 20 minutes (shockingly he managed to find a way on how to make his Let's Plays even <b>MORE</b> [[boring]]). His videos are incredibly over-produced for what is in reality a 20 year old [[aspie]] playing a video game for youtube. The videos obviously take a stupidly long time to film, edit and render, and it is evident that Chuggaaconroy does not have a life outside the [[interwebs]]. Here is a list of the games Chuggaconroy has ruined by playing them:

*[[Earthbound]]
*[[Electric Boogaloo|Earthbound 2: Electric Boogaloo]]
*[[shit|Paper Mario]]
*Some other terrible Mario RPG
*<b>ANOTHER</b> terrible Mario RPG
*[[Pokémon]] 
*[[Aspie|More Pokémon]]
*Shitty Mario [[Gamecube]] game
*Shitty Mario [[Wii]] game
*[[Pikmin]]
*[[lie|Pinball Construction Kit]]

===Suspended===

In July 2010, Chuggaaconroy [[shit nobody cares about|and other famous LP'ers]] were [[X Y is X|trolled successfully]] by a [[troll]] who was filing false copyright complaints on their videos under false names [[lol|like Richard Molina and Lynn ann Wayne]]. Youtube proceeded to suspend Chuggaaconroy and [[delete fucking everything|delete all his videos]]. This was breaking news of the [[internets]] for about 2 days and then everybody forgot about it because [[nobody cares]]. Unfortunately, the next month, Chuggaaconroy and others were given back their accounts. Chugga himself was even given a partnership with Youtube, so now he [[loser|makes money from playing video games.]]

[[Fags|Fan's]] of Chuggaaconroy around the world were devastated at the time, due to the loss of their favourite youtube [[loser]]. Some even made videos, like this [[13 year old boy|13 year old retard]] who appears to have cerebral palsy:

==Fans==

[[Image:NintendoKid.jpg|thumb|Typical Chuggaaconroy [[Fanboy]]]]

Chuggaconroy's Fanbase is one that consists of three elements. They are:

*[[13 year old boys]]
*<s>[[16-year-old girls]]</s> 
*Old [[Nintendo]] Fags

They are also some of the most groveling little shitwipe fans to ever exist. Say <b>ONE</b> bad thing about Chugga's videos or anything associated with Chuggaconroy, may it be constructive criticism or not, and they will get incredibly defensive and hostile. This also means it is incredibly fun to troll them.
