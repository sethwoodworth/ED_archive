The '''Heartagram''' is the universal symbol of [[emos]] and [[goths]] which you will find [[cum|splattered]] all over every emo [[MySpace]] page in existence. In truth, is it a scientific diagram of the [[emo]] path of activity most of the time. The three points on the lower half represent activities such as "crying to Fall Out Boy", "drawing anime faggotry", and "attempting to not [[suck]] at bass guitar". The upper two points represent "finally [[an hero|becoming an hero]]" and "dropping these bullshit values", in which emos will ''always'' curve their path away from and go to something else because of the gutless cowards that they are. 

==HIM==
The heartagram is the official logo of the band HIM. In fact, [http://www.heartagram.com heartagram.com] is the official HIM website, and the band goes so far as to hold a [[shameless self promotion|day in honour of the heartagram]], where they encouraged fans to vandalise public property in exchange for the chance to win a shitty signed guitar. Only members of their "Heartagram Club" could enter, meanings that the 13 year olds who couldn't steal Mom's credit card before the big event missed out on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
