seisatsu entered #arbchat seeking to have [[:File:Seisatsu.png]] purged from [[Internet Freedom Movement]]. Honorable Andrew Weevlos presided.

<pre>[12:58]  * seisatsu (seisatsu@l0ld0ngs-EED0AD7.dsl.pltn13.sbcglobal.net) has joined #arbchat
[12:58]  <seisatsu> alright look
[12:59]  <seisatsu> I enjoy this site, but I'd like to ask for the pictures of my dick to be removed.
[12:59]  <seisatsu> seriously, I've seen worse, and I don't mind being the butt of jokes, but only when they don't involve my penis.
[12:59]  * dan (adam.weish@l0ld0ngs-BE90391C.columbus.res.rr.com) has joined #arbchat
[12:59]  * mediacrat sets modes [#arbchat +ao dan dan]
[13:00]  <seisatsu> So, I am asking for the picture in question to be removed.
[13:00]  <seisatsu> It's a tinychat screencap stolen by spais
[13:00]  <dowat> so let me get this straight
[13:00]  <dan> i do not see any judges around at the moment, would you like to schedule an appointment
[13:00]  <seisatsu> Judges...
[13:00]  <dowat> you put a picture of your dick on the internet
[13:00]  <seisatsu> oh boy
[13:00]  <dowat> and are now upset that it's out there
[13:00]  <dan> yes, it is ARBITRATION after all
[13:01]  <seisatsu> If a private chat room with 3 people constitutes "on the internet"
[13:01]  <seisatsu> then, yes. Yes I did.
[13:01]  <dan> if it hits a server, its pretty much fair game
[13:01]  <seisatsu> hmph.
[13:02]  <dan> link me the page that contains the discussed image
[13:02]  <seisatsu> http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Internet_Freedom_Movement
[13:02]  <seisatsu> This DID contain the image
[13:02]  <seisatsu> it's been removed like 10 times by supporters of the mentioned group.
[13:02]  <dowat> actually it does again
[13:02]  <seisatsu> yeah
[13:02]  <seisatsu> someone is lurking
[13:03]  <seisatsu> and resetting edits.
[13:03]  <dowat> that's me, fucktard
[13:03]  <seisatsu> :/
[13:03]  <dan> yeah, you arent going to get this removed that easily
[13:03]  <dan> and since it is causing drama, this case is definately going to need an arbitraiton
[13:04]  <seisatsu> I know it doesn't disappear once it's on the internet.
[13:04]  <seisatsu> It's the first rule of internet.
[13:04]  <dowat> yet you want it to disappear
[13:04]  <seisatsu> I want it to disappear from here.
[13:04]  <seisatsu> I don't like my name on it
[13:04]  <dowat> this shit is hilarious
[13:04]  <seisatsu> and I don't like that my dick is flaccid in that picture.
[13:04]  <seisatsu> so
[13:05]  <dowat> this entire fucking article is shit no one cares about
[13:05]  <seisatsu> yeah
[13:05]  <seisatsu> I know
[13:05]  <dowat> yet you retards back and forthing about it has made it matter 100x more
[13:06]  <dan> seisatsu: i have put the word out and i expect something back today concerning this matter
[13:07]  <dan> hahaha, nice talk page
[13:09]  * zaigermobile (these.@re.not.the.droids.youre.looking.for) has joined #arbchat
[13:09]  <seisatsu> oh
[13:09]  <seisatsu> someone removed it again.
[13:09]  <zaigermobile> hi
[13:09]  <dan> hold on seis
[13:10]  * weev (madrasa@al-paca.akhbar) has joined #arbchat
[13:10]  <weev> hello
[13:10]  <dan> the image is still on ED, its just not on that page anymore
[13:10]  <dan> http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Internet_Freedom_Movement
[13:10]  <seisatsu> Yeah I know
[13:10]  <seisatsu> so basically
[13:10]  <seisatsu> If an arbitrator decides to remove the image
[13:11]  <seisatsu> someone will reupload and post it somewhere else?
[13:11]  <dan> well, weev is here right now, you can take your case up with him if he is willing
[13:11]  <zaigermobile> im on that already
[13:11]  <seisatsu> And then the arbitrator has to decide again or what?
[13:11]  <dan> http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Seisatsu.png
[13:11]  <dan> its still there, just not on the page
[13:11]  <seisatsu> I'm asking if arbitration is a farse.
[13:11]  <seisatsu> I know, yeah
[13:11]  <dan> nope
[13:11]  <seisatsu> thanks for sharing
[13:12]  <dan> its seriouos
[13:12]  <dan> serious
[13:12]  <seisatsu> srs bsns
[13:12]  <zaigermobile> serious business
[13:12]  <zaigermobile> yes
[13:12]  <seisatsu> I always wondered if it was illegal to post pictures of a non-minor's dick without their consent.
[13:12]  <seisatsu> I guess not.
[13:13]  <dan> was that a veiled or frivolous legal threat?
[13:13]  <weev> yes hello
[13:13]  <seisatsu> haha, I can't even afford mcdonalds
[13:13]  <seisatsu> so no
[13:13]  <dan> okay
[13:13]  <weev> okay so
[13:13]  <seisatsu> so
[13:13]  <weev> this article is largely unfunny
[13:13]  <seisatsu> my penis escaped to the internet
[13:13]  <seisatsu> and wound up here.
[13:14]  <seisatsu> what can you do about it?
[13:14]  <weev> ur dick is the only thing making it remotely funny
[13:14]  <seisatsu> yeah
[13:14]  <seisatsu> this is true.
[13:14]  <seisatsu> Well the article is an attack on IFM
[13:14]  <seisatsu> But it isn't funny, so I don't care.
[13:14]  <weev> i dont know what IFM is
[13:14]  <weev> ive never heard of it
[13:14]  <seisatsu> yeah
[13:14]  <seisatsu> exactly
[13:15]  <seisatsu> it's an article that was made as an attack
[13:15]  <weev> are you part of this IFM thing
[13:15]  <seisatsu> which I guess is common
[13:15]  <seisatsu> yeah
[13:15]  <seisatsu> I am.
[13:15]  <seisatsu> I don't care about the article.
[13:15]  <seisatsu> That dick was screencapped a month ago, and I still don't know who did it
[13:15]  <seisatsu> There were only 3 people who could've
[13:16]  <seisatsu> lots of drama
[13:16]  <seisatsu> anyway
[13:16]  * JuniusThaddeus (love@tobe.here) has joined #arbchat
[13:16]  * ptime (troll2@way.of.juche.is.stlong.nk) has joined #arbchat
[13:16]  <seisatsu> Are you able to do anything about it?

[13:16]  <weev> whatever the fuck i want
[13:16]  <seisatsu> yeah
[13:16]  <weev> im just thinking like
[13:16]  <weev> whats my motivation here
[13:16]  <seisatsu> so whatever the fuck do you want to do?
[13:17]  <seisatsu> ah. So arbitration is a farse.
[13:17]  <weev> removing ur dick from the article
[13:17]  <weev> makes it less funny
[13:17]  <weev> no
[13:17]  <zaigermobile> sweeten the pot a little weeaboo
[13:17]  <weev> its not a farce
[13:17]  <seisatsu> *farse

[13:17]  <seisatsu> sigh
[13:17]  <seisatsu> yeah

[13:17]  <weev> farce.

[13:24]  <seisatsu> The problem is

[13:26]  <seisatsu> you know the one, that required captchas
[13:26]  <JuniusThaddeus> Teenagers on 4chan isn't interesting.

[13:26]  <weev> yeah 4chan is fucking dead
[13:27]  <dowat> i like /fit/ and /lit/ but that's not really what you think of when you think 4chan
[13:27]  <seisatsu> Well
[13:27]  <seisatsu> I liked the part where jamer was eaten by a bear
[13:27]  <seisatsu> but

[13:30]  <seisatsu> yeah
[13:30]  <seisatsu> It's falling apart
[13:30]  <ptime> or just don't do a movement
[13:30]  <Becca> what is this arbchat about?
[13:30]  <ptime> calling anything a movement destroys it
[13:30]  <dowat> Becca: seisatsu seeks to have his dick pick removed from [[IFM]]
[13:30]  <seisatsu> Can we just delete the article and forget it happened?
[13:30]  <seisatsu> Since it's shit and all
[13:30]  <dowat> pic, whatever.
[13:30]  <weev> no
[13:30]  <JuniusThaddeus> Becca: Solving disputes.
[13:30]  <weev> how about
[13:30]  <weev> you make the article good
[13:31]  <weev> filled with awesome ruins
[13:31]  <weev> of acta-related figures
[13:31]  <weev> and ur dick can not be included
[13:31]  <weev> otherwise, fuck all of you ineffectual nerds
[13:31]  <dan> the MPAA thing sounded nice too weev
[13:31]  <seisatsu> I'm not in charge of IFM >.>
[13:31]  <dowat> no one is "in charge" of the article
[13:31]  <seisatsu> no
[13:31]  <seisatsu> but if I want to ruin some actas
[13:32]  <seisatsu> I have to do it on my own.
[13:32]  <zaigermobile> that is your decision
[13:33]  <zaigermobile> you are the one who pulled is pants down on the internet
[13:33]  <zaigermobile> his
[13:33]  <dowat> ^
[13:33]  <seisatsu> Well

[13:33]  <dowat> seriously man, you whipped your dick out on webcam. if you didn't want it getting out, DON'T WHIP YOUR DICK OUT ON WEBCAM
[13:33]  <zaigermobile> well nothing
[13:33]  <dowat> how fucking hard is this
[13:33]  <seisatsu> Though I didn't screencap.
[13:34]  <zaigermobile> there are tits all over the internet
[13:34]  <seisatsu> yeah well, there's no undo button on the internet.

[13:34]  <ptime> lol

[13:35]  <seisatsu> If I made the article funny, would that be bribing a judge?
[13:36]  <ptime> not exactly
[13:36]  <ptime> more like serving a sentence
[13:36]  <ptime> that's the point
[13:36]  <ptime> if you want us to do something for you
[13:36]  <ptime> you gotta do something for us
[13:36]  <seisatsu> sigh
[13:37]  * Faust (fucking@idiot.derp) has joined #arbchat
