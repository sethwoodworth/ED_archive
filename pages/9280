In a world where kids today see things in black and white, [[Hippy|Democrat]] and [[Nazi|Republican]], Emo and Ganguro, Atheist and Christian, there are only two ratings people give, 1 and 5. But now you know how to rate, let's see what the ratings mean.

==1 Star==

A video receives 1 star when the peanut gallery particularly hates it. It could be a picture of a kitten being crushed, or a 12 year old whose parents just bought him an electric guitar murdering Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" (PROTIP: It's not that hard to play). This is the most common rating for a video. These must be watched for their sheer comic value.

==2 Stars==

Your 2 star video is not completely awful, but bad enough for the majority of people to rate it 1 star. These may be terrible vlogs, attempts by old media to appeal to the younger generation, or something deeply unpopular, like Scientology, or a member of Anonymous doing what they do best - acting like a faggot. Avoid.

==3 Stars==

A video with 3 stars shows either an indifferent or polarized audience. Videos which elicit apathy are usually tl;dw vlogs or music videos by [[Nickelback|middle of the road rockers]]. Videos which polarize the audience include shit by atheists/christians, talking about Dawkins/God, and circle jerking their idol. To be avoided.

==4 Stars==

4 star videos are getting there, but lacking that certain something that pushes them to five stars. Usually contains a subject that everyone likes, such as tax refunds, kittens, decapitations and enemas. Don't know if want.

==5 Stars==

Lastly there are the five star videos. These videos are recognised to be epic in some way or another. You must watch every single one.
