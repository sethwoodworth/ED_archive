'''''Duke Nukem Forever''''' (aka DNF aka vaporware) is a bait and switch scheme perpetrated by 3D Realms on the fans of 1996 [[FPS|fragfest]] ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]''. The game itself, which does not exist, is about an [[adult baby]] whose job it is to "kick ass and chew bubblegum." Unfortunately, in DN3 he was perpetually [[fail|out of gum]], thus necessitating a sequel. The [[fucktards]] at 3D Realms announced this scam in 1997, and they still insist to this day that they are working on it. In fact, they named it "''Duke Nukem Forever''" because IT TAKES FUCKING FOREVER TO MAKE IT!! Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact these asshats have released several other games including ''Max Payne'', the sequel to ''Max Payne'', an expansion pack for ''Duke Nukem 3D'', a [[Stormfront|racism-perpetrating crapfest]], and a clone-mod called ''Shadow Warrior''. They are currently known to spend all day getting paid to make [[Photoshop]] images of their imaginary fucking game with investors' money.

== "When it's done" == 

[[Image:Duke_Nukem_Forever11.jpg|thumb|<s>Doesn't</s> Does actually exist.]]

DNF's Creative Director George Broussard is famous for having mercilessly [[Rape|abused]] the phrase "when it's done". Doing so was a smart move on his part since he never actually intended to release anything other than screenshots of the game. Saying you won't release a game until its "done" implies, in the video game industry, that you won't release it until you are totally happy with the quality of your product and will therefore be a [[GG|good game]]. This stance has earned them a permanent seat in [[interweb]] history as a completely unintentional [[meme]].

[[Image:WhenItsDone.png|center|[http://www.google.com/search?q=when+it's+done lol]]]

''Duke Nukem Forever'''s infinitely long development has spawned a completely unintentional Googlebomb. When searching [[The Google]] for the phrase [http://www.google.com/search?q=when+it's+done "when it's done"], Google returns almost entirely ''Duke Nukem Forever'' related results.

The real genius behind DNF is that it doesn't really exist at all. It's all been an elaborate hoax from day one. Luckily, 3D Realms was clever enough to realize that the promise of another orgy of boobies and violence is all that it that it takes to stir [[internet]]s [[Fantard|fanbois]] into a masturbatory frenzy. Thus, the fairy tale of ''Duke Nukem Forever'' begins...

=== Step 0: Make up some fake in game footage ===
At least 10 years ago, while PC Gaymer's own Coconut Monkey was laboriously working on his magnum opus, Gravy Trader, the fags at 3D Realms tossed them some '[[Screencap|screenshots]]' of what DNF was looking like...which were, of course, [http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=52193 completely fake] - composed entirely of modded ''[[Quake]]'' levels. 

{{quote|We didn't get Quake 2 code till Dec 97/Jan 98. We made the mistake of mocking some stuff up in Quake 1 (like a user mod) for PC Gamer...Most of that was stuff we did in spare time, jacking around, as we were finishing Shadow Warrior, and waiting on Quake 2 code. We didn't even have programmers for DNF until late 1999.|George Broussard on the early DNF screenshots, May 2003.}} 

=== Step 1: Announce it ===
The first step in this grand scheme was to [http://web.archive.org/web/19991012010949/www.3drealms.com/press/0428972.html make up] some way for the game to exist in the first place. The idiots at ''PC Gaymer'' were more than ready to take on this task by making this elaborate forgery their cover story. 

That's what they get for trusting an inanimate paperweight with a conflict of interest. 

{{quote|Our goal is to release Duke Nukem Forever no later than mid-1998...|George Broussard, the original DNF 3D Realms Press Release, April 28, 1997.}}

Of course, ''Duke Nukem Forever'''s announcement came as no surprise even to the ancient [[interwebs]]. A sequel was eagerly anticipated and ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' was one of the hawtest ''[[Doom]]'' rip-offs that [[Don't Copy That Floppy|nobody actually paid for]]. 

Evar. 

However, the fact that the game was not going to contain [[buttsecks]] with either alien mutated pigs or pixelated wimmenz enraged the [[furfags]] and [[13-year-old boys]]. Everything was going perfectly according to plan.

=== Step 1.5: '[[Tard]] around. ===
The next stage of the hoax was to [[bullshit]] the public into believing the game was in development hell. 3D Realms decided to do this [http://www.3drealms.com/press/dnfunreal.html under the pretense of constant engine switches]. 

{{quote|The game should not be significantly delayed...|George Broussard on the switch to the Unreal engine, 3D Realms Press Release, June 15, 1998.}}

Thus, after making up screenshots styled after ''[[Quake]]'', they switched to making screenshots for ''Quake II''. Afterward, they decided they were bored making screenshots with ''Quake II'' and decided to make them with ''Unreal'' instead. After a short "adjustment period" they released their next batch of bogus screens to a starved public. Fans were dismayed to find that there were no polygonal [[boobies]] featured in this latest round of fakes. The charade would [http://www.3drealms.com/news/99card2.html continue] for [http://www.3drealms.com/news/00card3.html three] years:

{{quote|A bottle of Jack and a young warm belly <br> Awaited Duke like pink nubile jelly.<br>And I heard him exclaim saying 'Never say never,<br> A good year's to come with Duke Nukem Forever!'|3D Realms 1999 Christmas card.}}

{{quote|Duke Nukem Forever <br>Coming 'when it's done' in 2001|3D Realms 2000 Christmas Card.}}

=== Step 2: [[Goatse]] your publisher ===
Meanwhile, when Infogamers acquired GT Interactive in 2000, they were actually smart enough to see DNF as the nefarious bait-and-switch scheme that it was. Thus they [http://www.3drealms.com/press/dukefindsgod.html shoveled the rights for the game] onto the poor and naive Gathering of Developers (aka G.O.D.) for good ol' [[PROFIT!|cash/money]]. [[God|GOD]] promptly folded after releasing, like, 2 shit games and managed to pass the buck to Take Two Interactive. 

Being the [[Grand Theft Auto|fun loving]] [http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19260.htm criminals] they were, Take Two didn't put up with Broussard's bullshit. In their yearly earnings statements from 2002 to 2005 they repeatedly [http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=52193 questioned 3D Realms publicly] about the status of the next batch of screenshots. In a fit of [[Basement-dweller|prepubescent]] rage, Broussard responded by [[Troll|trolling]] 3D Realms' own forums:

{{quote|Take Two needs to [[STFU]] [[IMO]].|George Broussard on Take Two Interactive in an actual forum post, May 2003.}}

=== Step 3: [[????]] ===
No one really knows what happened over at 3D Realms from 2004 to 2007. [[Some argue]] that 3D Realms had actually closed up shop entirely. Then they came out with ''[[Indians|Prey]]'', a [[crap]] [[FPS]] about some [[Native Americans|prairie nigger]] who gets kidnapped by [[Xenu]]. However, it turns out that they were, in between alternate bouts of [[buttsecks]] and [[trolling]], in fact working on their most convincing fake yet.

=== Step 4: [[PROFIT!]] ===

<center>{{frame|<youtube>cWuteFLUPSY</youtube>|color=#FF9751}}</center> 

{{quote|We've spent years [[Bukkake|bukkaking]] in our offices and all we got to show for it is this stupid video.|George Broussard's T-shirt, December 19, 2007.}}

Whether any of this footage is actually taken from actual gameplay remains to be seen. However, if DNF's history is any indication, this is just another in a [[Money|lucrative]] series of bogus videos thrust into the limelight over the years. At this point, if the game ever actually does come out, it will most likely be a tremendous pile of dog [[shit]] like its brother in [[hell]], ''[[Daikatana]]''.

=== Step 5: Or maybe not ===
[[Image:Bawwww.jpeg|thumb|The fans' reaction]]

After [[over 9000|12]] years of [[Procrastination|hard work]], and money spent on [[hookers|development]] and [[cocaine|artwork]], 3D Realms has finally announced they are shutting down for good. Duke Nukem Forever will go down as the biggest [[fail|failure]] in video game history. Chances that the game will be released now are pretty much zero, not like anyone ever thought any differently. George Broussard is likely in the process of <s>[[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|deleting all evidence that the game ever existed]]</s> giving [http://www.joystiq.com/2009/05/08/laid-off-3d-realms-staff-show-off-duke-nukem-forever-concept-art/|Sending Concept Art, Screenshots, and the entire plot to every major video game website and magazine in existence]. [[The End]].

=== Step 6: Take 2 [[lawsuit|suing]] Microsoft===

Following the closure, and leaks, Take 2 quickly pulled [[over_9000|$30 Million]] Dollars out of their asses in order to bribe George Broussard for the rights to ''Duke Nukem'', whilst there has been rumors Microsoft has bought out 3D Realms after quietly selling off $4 Billion dollars worth of bonds out of the blue, while Take 2 still holds the publishing rights.

Take 2 has decided to [http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58642 sue 3D Realms for utterly failing to deliver DNF], which was vaporware from the start.

=== Step 7: The Truth Comes Out ===

Now that the ''Duke Nukem Forever'' team have been laid off, the truth about some of the [[bullshit|"in game footage"]] came to light on the 3D Realms forums from pissed off ex-employees, although unsuprisingly it was deleted:
{{quote|The 2001 trailer was 100% scripted cinematic, and not actual gameplay. They built specific demo maps just to record video from to make a trailer. Everything you see in that trailer was phony.|Anonymous 3D Realms Ex-staff Member. Referenced trailer below.}}

''Duke Nukem Forever'' gameplay footage released following the closure of 3DRealms in May 2009. This leaked video was to serve as a demo reel for animator Byan Brewer.

* Every ''[[Silent Hill]]'' game and various spin-offs.
* The ''[[Metroid|Metroid Prime]]'' trilogy, 4 original releases and 5 re-releases. (It should also be noted that the music of ''[[AZN|Kenji Yamamoto]]'' is far better than the butt-smelling cock-rock of ''[[Duke nukem|DN3D]]''.)

* Every ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' game and various clones.

== Holy Fucking Shit, it's almost done? == 
Apparently, DNF is being developed by Gearbox Studios, of ''[[Borderlands]]'' and ''Brothers in Arms'' fame.  Restock your bubblegum, motherfuckers.

===Release Date===

According to Amazon and Gamestop, the release date has been set for <s>February 1st</s> May 3rd, 2011. Gearbox has stated that this date is a place holder for now. Only time will tell whether another twelve years will be needed to complete this game.

== IT LIVES! ==
[[Image:Dnftrolled.PNG|thumb|Duke Nukem Forever just trolled his fan when he was at PAX. [[lie|At least he can overlook the reloading issue.]]]]
On September 3, 2010, Take Two allowed 150,000 people to play a copy of the game as one of the greatest acts of trolling in history. Consequently, 150,000 people subsequently vanished from the face of the earth, never to be heard from again.
Initial reports from the PAX floor is that the game isn't anything special and is your [[Call of Duty|bogstandard FPS]] with the best bit being Duke's one liners with no strippers. Whether the game will be released in 2011 as said by 2K and Gearbox is yet to be seen. It is more likely the game will be released on [[2012|December 21st, 2012]].
