Whale Safe Beer
[[File:Whalebus.gif|thumb|Whales waiting for a taxi after a heavy night on the ale.]]
In July 1855 a Cape Cod fisherman noted that [[black]]fish, the animals we now call [[whales]], ''ran ashore in pursuit of beer, and that they generally came on the coast about [[16 year old girls|Spring Break]].'' What interested [[Anon]] about whales wasn't their drink drivings, but the fact that they themselves had seen the volumetrically challenged mammals purposely driven ashore for their blubber. ''Leaping over the sea like fat bastards,'' the whales were pursued by [[men]] ''striking on the sides of their cars and blowing horns to drive them on to the beach.'' Anon expressed no sense of kinship with the whales, only a revulsion at the stench [http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/31/opinion/pilot-whales-aground.html?pagewanted=1].

Nowadays [[ED|we]] make sure that [[you|whales]] are only provided with whale safe beverages thanks to [[Science]].
