''Keep it simple, stupid!'' This term has a long and glorious history with the US military, and is usually referenced as ''KISS RuleZ.'' Things break when they get too complex anyway.  Additionally there is a rich [[computer]] history of the term, especially (of late) in the [[UNIX]] world, whereas the rest of the world's code has come to be very [[tl;dr]]. This term can also be used to refer to a rock band, about whom Sunday school teachers theorize the name stands for ''Knights in Service of Satan'' (I shit you not).
Most of the members of said rock band are nearing retirement age, which will make things simple indeed. 


Sample Usages:<br>
::''If [[you]] don't '''KISS''', don't bitch when nobody pays attention to you.''<br>
::''Holy hell, private, if you violated KISS any more I'd have to kick the shit out of you.''
