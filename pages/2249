'''Dickipedia''' is [[Uncyclopedia|yet another attempt]] to create a moar "[[Fag|appropriate]]" and "[[Fag|work safe]]" satirical wiki by using the word [[Fag|dick]] instead of fag and nigger. Despite calling itself a wiki, there is actually no way to obtain a login, thus there is [[Bullshit|no way to edit articles]], thus it is not actually a wiki. The reason they provide for this minor incongruity is they don't seem to think that [[Redneck|regular ol']] [[Pedophiles|internet folk]] will "be good," because they are elitist [[jews]] that think only [[Furfags|professional comedians]] can achieve [[lulz]].

The site is run by Huffington Post Comedy, another [[shit]] site that is comprised of comedy blogs, [[wtf|gossip entirely unrelated to comedy]], old spice commercials, and David Letterman. Why they would let basement dwelling [[13 year old boys]] write blogs about their faggy opinions and not let anyone edit their [[Lie|really funny]] wiki about how [[Duh|celebrities are dicks]] is a mystery that is almost too retarded to care about. The good news is that 90% of the site is comprised of [[copypasta]] clips of well known television comedies, and absolutely no [[OC]] to be found. This is probably why they decided to create Dickipedia, a [[Lie|refreshingly original concept]] to make fun of [[Niggers|people we dont like]] [[Satire|by means of exaggerating their least savory characteristics in such a way that we appear to be complimenting them when we are really pointing out what huge faggots they are]]. Does anyone know if these guys can [[triforce]]?

Its basically ED except for [[faggots]] who get uncomfortable and bothered when people use a [[Shit|curse word]] or [[DOUBLE NIGGER|derogatory remark]], and about celebrities no one gives a fuck about. [[wtf|Imagine ED but everyone is afraid to piss anyone off or be mean]]. Scientists have even gone so far as to say that they would "prefer uncyclopedia to this supreme faggotry."

==Article Structure==

Every article begins by describing the [[Shit no one cares about|celebrity's profession]] and then adding "and a dick" to the end of the sentence. From this point on, every article follows the same exact structure as any other article on TOW, going through their personal life, profesional careers, and of course, ending with [[Shit no one cares about|some trivia]], where they repeatedly [[fail]] at satire. Note how the page on [http://www.dickipedia.org/dick.php?title=Glenn_Beck Glenn Beck] doesn't once mention how [[Glenn Beck Raped And Murdered A Young Girl In 1990|he raped and murdered a girl in 1990]]. 

Every now and again you'll find a phrase such as:

{{Quote|Tyra made the list again in 1996, this time joined by Martha Stewart, Jenny McCarthy, and that self-important butt-wad who hosts "America’s Most Wanted." This begs the question: Who’s making these lists over there at 'People'?|Dickipedia creating [[anti-lulz]]. It should also be noted that the next section contains the phrase "[[Faggotry|Boy howdy!]]"}}

Also to note: they put Tyra fucking banks on their list instead of someone who people actually give a fuck about.

==Suspicions of Faggotry==

It is only natural that when someone creates a wiki about dicks, that is so riddled with mention of dick, that one would come to suspect that [[Fact|the author or authors of the site might in fact enjoy some dick]]. While it is entirely possibly that they may have missed the meeting where the world decided that political commentary + [[Oprah|over 9000 dicks]] equaled [[faggot]] instead of [[lulz]], but [[srsly]], they clearly [[Fag|crave the cock]].

A typical reader of Dickipedia. Make note of her highly stimulating and riveting speech.

Unfortunately, there is limited information on the wiki because they wont let anyone have a fucking login, and most of their links lead to blank pages. 

==List of Dicks without Articles==

*[[Andy Dick]]
*Tom Greene
*Lars Ulric
*[[Communists|Mao Tse-Tung]]
*[[Anonymous]]
*[[Osama Bin Laden]]
*[[Jews|The Jews]]
*[[Kimmo Alm]]
*[[Al Gore]]
*[[You]]

What we can determine from this is that the writers for Dickipedia love [[Canadians]], [[Heavy Metal|thrash metal]], [[lulz|genocides and mass famine]], the [[Internet Hate Machine]], [[terrorism]], [[Jews]], [[AnT]] and [[global warming]]. Even with all that, they still can't seem to write a [[lulzy]] fucking article.
