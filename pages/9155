{{lj|user=wowzaz_86}} is a [[basement-dwelling]] [[sick fuck]] who [[Cunnilingus|went down]] on some chick [http://www.livejournal.com/users/wowzaz_86/6694.html while she was asleep]. His defense was that he didn't enjoy it and that he stopped when it became clear that she didn't either (i.e. woke up). Besides, she was obviously [[asking for it]] by being asleep in the first place, [[amirite]]??

He then proceeded to whine in his [[journal]] about how the whole incident was threatening to ruin ''his'' life. (See [[Victim complex]])

{{quote|I have the [[freedom|right]] [[Butthurt|to be indignant if I so choose to be.]] You nor anyone else has the power to take that away from me. I have learned a lot about you through not actually interacting with you, and I have come to the conclusion that you are and were a waste of my time. I am sorry that I ever said anything nice to you. It has all turned out to be false. You are not a good person, you aren't even nice.
About being ashamed, I'm really not. Everything that I did was for your benefit. And the fact that you were incapable of reasoning that makes you worthless to me. I have only one regret concerning our "relationship," and that is that it lasted so long and I got so attached to you and others that you have sunk your venom into. We both know that this has made you a better person. And we both know that I will forever be attached to you... or rather have gotten over you completely with your assistance. [[Bullshit|So frankly scarlet, I just don't give a damn about you anymore.]] Gimme a call when you think you can man up and hear my side out, rather, send me a facebook message and lose my damned number. You are dead to me, and I hope that you stay that way.

==The Anonymous flood==
On December 31st, [[2005]], wowzaz posted a "[[Rape]] is Love" [[colorbar]] on [http://www.livejournal.com/users/wowzaz_86/9366.html his journal]. [[Cdaae]], who was [[e-pal]]s with the [[girl]] in question, saw this, and made [http://www.livejournal.com/users/cdaae/235496.html a post] about it. Of course, this attracted the attention of various [[trolls]], who were more than happy to take the fight to wowzaz_86's journal.

Lively debate between [[cdaae]]'s [[friends list]] and wowzaz_86's followed, until certain of the [[drama whore]]s taking part got bored, and decided to post the entire backstory to [[4chan]]. Within seconds, [[anonymous]] trolls and their [[sock puppet]]s were flooding into wowzaz_86's [[LiveJournal]] and filling it with shock images, [[meme]]s and accusations of [[rape]].

The story was reposted to 4chan every hour, causing more and more of its members to flock to wowzaz_86's journal. Each re-telling of the event was more exaggerated than the last, until eventually wowzaz_86 was a notorious [[Ohbutyouwillpet|child rapist]]. After a few pages worth of anonymous [[comment]]s, wowzaz_86 made [http://www.livejournal.com/users/wowzaz_86/9520.html one final post] to tell everyone to "[[No life|Get lives]]" and to announce he was [[Deleting your LiveJournal|deleting his livejournal]]. Of course, this was also flooded by the anonymous hordes in a matter of minutes.

But the final blow was delivered when [[recommendation]] realised that the [[colorbar]] had been [[hotlink]]ed from her. She hurriedly went about creating a suitably [[XBox|HUEG]] replacement image and switched it with the colorbar. It still remains even to this day, a memorial to his crushing defeat and apparent inability to edit his own posts.

As of 07/12/2009, wowzaz_86's [[journal]] was still being [[crapflood]]ed by /b/tards.
