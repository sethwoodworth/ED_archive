==London==

[[Image:Seaarrrrghh.jpeg|thumb]]
[[Image:Shanties.jpg|thumb]]

Best headcount: 350+, things got difficult to count after the move.

Being hailed by some Anon as the best raid ever.

Queen Victoria Street Org kicked off with a guy in a gorilla suit, a storey-high "CULT" sign and a full-sized Good Ship [[Longcat]].

Anon were supported throughout by oldguard protestors, ex-scilons and one nice lady who still has relatives in there. Camera crews, reporters and writers were in attendance. One Anon had his picture taken with a smiling policemen. Barring one guy angrily talking to the cops, the scifags were totally absent (curious considering reports are coming in from all corners of the country that all org workers had been sent to London for the day).

At half past midday, an Anon carried around a fully-inflated paddling pool with the words "SIXTY SECOND [[Facepalm|FACEPALM]] COMMENCES SOON," and a full minute of "Not this shit again" was held in the direction of the Org.

At one, a gigantic flyover of the Royal Air Force complete with bombers, fighter escorts and command aircraft flew overhead. Half the Anons ran around screaming "JESUS CHRIST IT'S THE FLEET, GET IN THE ORG" while the other half tried to wave the planes down, screaming "DO A BARREL ROLL!"

<br><center><youtube>9RATd_rwpA4</youtube></center><br>

Following this, the logistics of transporting several hundred Protestfags via a series of tubes were confronted.. In the ensuing chaos an entire tube train was Bel-Aired.

At Tottenham Court Road the moralfags were joinged by an escapist from a rival cult who came to compare notes. Drive-by lulzings were conducted by bus, a "How Many Anons Can You Fit In A Phone Booth" contest was held, Ex-Seaorg Cat was happy, sea shanties including "What Shall We Do With The Drunken Scilon" were sung raucously, and the TOTALLY EMPTY recruitment centre was treated to the vocal stylings of Oingo Boingo and GlaDOS.

Freezoner Terril Park talked to ED, and informed us that CSI are now so frightened that they are trying to cut deals with Scilons whose lives they have already ruined by having them declared by offering to sell them tech in return for letting them back in.

The frankly terrifying amount of free delicious caek on show was augmented at this point by femanons skipping up and down the street handing out ice lollies and shouting "LOOK! YOU CANS HAVE DELICIOUS LOLLY!"

The police, when asked to give us a quote, characterised the event as "Very peaceful." A big thank-you card was covered in [[Mudkips]] and liek by Anons, but they were unable to accept gifts.  Epic Nose Guy (who is no longer underage b&), when asked for a quote, said "CULT CULT CULT CULT CULT CULT CULT CULT CULT."

No dead-agenting. No black PR. Helpful and polite police. The only casualty of the day was [[PieAreSquare|Pie's favourite mask,]] which he gave to [[ENG]]'s girlfriend as a result of being momentarily possessed by [[Pedobear]]. O lawd, is this sum victory?

'''UPDATE:''' No, it's not. Apparently they were all at a conference in St. Hill. Epic fail. Oh well, [[Leeroy Jenkins|at least we had chicken.]]

==Edinburgh==

The Scifags have stolen the regular protest spot, and there was trouble trying to get another protest spot nearby. But the Scotfags were like "fuck this" and the 50+ anon collective fought back with a [[rape|'''SURPRISE BUTTRAID''']]. They then had a [[waaaambulance|waahmbulance]] called on their asses and were then given a fine bit of police intimidation. 
They were threatened with arrests if anon didn't take off their masks. One anon was forcibly intimidated into a leader position by the police as he submitted the protest application. 

Anon were eventually moved to a street just behind the protest place (The motherfuckin' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mile Royal Mile]), which turned out to be [[9000|over 9000]] times more busier. Rendering the Scilons' efforts to an embarassing footbullet. 
Fun was still had, and like always there was plenty of cake. One generous anon even brought a whole suitcase full of it.

Unfortunately, one raidfag got [[FBI|v&]] for having a sign saying "Stupid/Greedy cu*t". We salute you.


'''BONUS FEATURE'''

A Scientology seminar was being held at the org on the same day, and some passers-by voluntarily infiltrated it. One was a Christian and decided to question them about religious tolerance in Scientology, only to be given very vague answers. A full report by them will be hopefully submitted to the Edinburgh anon forums, sooner or later.

==Manchester==

Up to 75 Anon vs 2 Police. '''YES!'''

Fifty-Anon linedance. Nobody arrested, even when one failfag tried to climb the org. Nothing else to say. Simply beautiful.

==Birmingham==

Approx. 40 Anonymous throughout the day.
Police/Community Support Officers were fine with us being there, had no complaints about usage of the word 'cult' this time. One did make a fuss about the megaphone at one point though.
No arrests or fines at all.

Even without leaflets (Still not got the situation sorted), managed to talk to numerous members of the public. Music, dancing, swordfights, pirate flag waving could be heard and seen throughout the day, attracting attention. Most members of the public seemed to have some idea what we were doing, and those that voiced an opinion pretty much all agreed with what we were doing.

Delicious caek, and other snacks/drinks were plentiful.

Everyone within earshot CANS have OT3!

Anon cans not have pizza, due to bad phone signals. :(

===Birmingham 'Gallery'===
You could have a gallery, but a compilation is much better:

==Plymouth==

Headcount of 25-30. Plymanons reporting epic win. Very receptive public, many heard around the city talking about the event, people coming up to Anon to thank him for doing it. Public even seen reading the long, wordy fliers. Looks like just a handful of Anons are doing a great job getting the message through.

==Brighton==

15 Anon handed out over 2000 fliers and an entire box of You Found The Card in the face of quite significant harassment from Scilons and BNP skinheads. In honour of their fight for great justice, "I can't hug you because you're an SP" is now a meme.

==Munich==

30 anons with disproportionately excellent presentation. Damn you all and your ruthless German efficiency. There was a request to remove masks which were too military in design for German law, but apart from that everything went smoothly.

20 stormtroopers of lulz took to the streets, one in a wheelchair. [http://s307.photobucket.com/albums/nn291/knutanon/?albumview=slideshow Epic Photobucket slideshow here.]

==Dusseldorf==
[[Image:Dusseldorfseaarg1.jpg|thumb|centre]]<br>No details yet, but at least 20 anons and a damn good time if the pictures are anything to go by.

==Stuttgart==

Doing it wrong in the best possible way, 23 anons took on the CSI with flowers and produced some really beautiful photos. Good job the Stuttgard lads and lasses looked their best, because 6 of the bOrg were filming them.

=Bonus Levels=

==Paris, France==

No solid details yet, apart from the involvement of a large OSA officer who has been dubbed [[Double Nigger|"Dr. Eggman"]] who attempted to give his side of the story to a local priest. When he saw Anon coming he ran like a fucking gazelle.

==Amsterdam, Netherlands==

48 counted. Over 2500 flyers dropped, including to one dude who looked genuinely shocked and said he was about to go into the Org to think about joining. '''IT'S AN OPEN GOAL! SCIENTOLOGY SHOOTS... BUT THE NETHERLANDS SAVE!!!!!!1'''

==Gothenburg, Sweden==

20 Anons distrubuted 2000 flyers to a positive public and delighted tourists. Police helpful throughout. Interestingly a man who claimed to have good political contacts informed Anon that the cult are often discussed in the Swedish parliament because they have one of the highest turnovers of the country (in a nation that houses economic giants like Volvo).

==Oslo==

At least 21 protestors, police horses, The King's Guard, the UK Royal Guard, full naval dress uniforms and flags so big they SNAPPED THE GOD DAMN POLES! Good game, Norway.

Stats: Almost 2000 flyers. About 40, 50 or 60 balloons and balloons swords with xenu and YouFoundTheCard handed out.

Sea Arrrgh had hired professional security guards. Three of them? CoS had one.

{{quote|LOL , the raid is still going strong , we have a mega loud speaker and are enturbulating the whole road. Theres about 20 of us , having a ball at their expense. Most of us wearing pirates gear with plastic swords and bubbles. LOL , the word CULT is everywhere in big red letters. Scifags out taking pix of us and bawwwwing to cops who basically told them to STFU and make a formal complaint if they want. Cops know about ENG:)
All going the pub after the raid so pix and videos should be up by tonight, heading back over now. Hail Xenu.|Anonakitty}}

==Brussels, Belgium==

Five Anons, some bizarrely friendly Scilons and two ex-members - OT6 and OT7! Oh, to have been a fly on the wall for that one.

==Moscow, Russia==

No reports yet.

==Budapest, Hungary==

At 2008. 06. 14. Anon held protest in Budapest too. They give handouts to bypassers in the street, at the other side of the local seaorg. This made the $cientologists [[butthurt]], and they even took it away from people, but later the police told them to [[GTFO|stop it]]. One of the $ci leaders even tried to remove a mask from an anon, and after the protest, they followed a taxi, that a fellow protester ordered.<br>Accordin to their forums, the raid was a success, people agrees with them.
