'''Ellen Feiss''' is a somewhat [[jailbait|comely teenager]] who appeared in one of the [[Apple switch ads]].

<div style="font-size: large; width: 12em; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0;"><p>“That being said, a lot of my fans have [[gay|turned out]] to be [[Nice Guy|nice]], [[Fucktard|intelligent]] [[Retard|Mac using people]].”</p><p style="text-align: right">— Ellen Feiss [http://macenstein.com/default/archives/509]</p></div>
Her ad gained a worldwide following due to her [[allegedly]] [[marijuana]]-influenced performance. That, combined with her [[hawt|good looks]] (at least compared to most [[Apple]] [[nerd]]s), made her somewhat of an [[internet celebrity]] - known as the stoner chick of the Apple Switch advertisements. Her popularity grew when she was spotted in the audience of an [[Apple]] keynote. When interviewed about her mental state during the filming, she claimed she had taken [[Benadryl]] right before.

She claimed that she wrote a paper on her father's PC and it ate the paper. Originally her dog ate her homework, but since [[Windows]] is known to crash (Beep Beep Beep Beep!), it was easier to blame the PC. She claimed it was a good paper and that she had to write a new one quickly, but it wasn't as good as the first one and got a low grade (apparently she was taking [[Cock|Benadryl]] at the time she wrote her paper as well). Her dad has since bought her a Mac, which she reports does not suffer from the all-too-common "paper consumption" ailment, however she continues to receive low grades due to the [[Cock|Benadryl]] habit she picked up.

Ellen's current whereabouts are unknown. However, she is attending college, and planning to major in either [[Porn|photography and video]] or [[Old porn|women's studies]]. For all your Ellen Feiss related [[stalk]]ing needs, see the links below.
