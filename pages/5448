MixandMatch is a user on [[ChavScum]] forum of the [[Drama whore]] kind who quickly accumulated over 1000 posts in a month. She sprung to prominence after her MSN address had been 'stolen' from her profile and passed around Teenchat to [[Pedophile|Horny Teenage boys]] the world over by the dastardly €uroboy.

Immediately she began to bleat about it to her fellow forum users, and in a moment of genius wrote.
''I'd like to put a grenade in his mouth and make him eat it''

Sadly for MixandMatch most people pointed out she made the mistake of putting her address in her profile and was ignored. She attempted to muscle in on €uroboy's calling out of [[fucktard]] elite TrollSpeil2, yet made another almighty blunder by repeatedly contradicting herself (''No I cant tell your IQ by reading stuff, but by what you say I know your not clever'') and was beaten in fine form along with Trollspeil2 and his other cohort Dan. In fact Trollspeil2 got mightily stamped on by other users as well as €uroboy[http://www.chavscum.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?p=530905#post530905].
