[[Image:Touchline.gif|thumb|250px|Rick gets so many votes that MTV is forced to [[divide by zero]].]]

In late September 2008, [[Rick Astley's Mum]] lobbied hard to get [[Rick Astley]] on the ballot as a write-in candidate for '''MTV Europe's 2008 Awards''' in the '''Best Act Ever''' category, along with a [[U2|Clash tribute band]], a couple of whores, and some pretend rock emo faggots. Rick won the write-in with 98% of the vote. And [[You|God]] saw that it was good.

On October 2nd, 2008, [http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/genre/e3i33dc3a76c50a24ef85f3dff704cc8e4e it was announced] that Rick Astley had indeed been [[om nom|omnomnominated]] for the award. 

This after a [[Zerg rush]] of [[anon|fan]] votes propelled him from not even on the radar to [[9000|'''off the fucking map''']]. MTV  opened voting [http://ema.mtv.co.uk/vote/#_274130150 here] and [[Anon|The Rick Astley Appreciation Society]] went to work lobbying /[[b]]/ to vote <big>vote!</big> <big><big>vote!!</big></big> <big><big><big>[[111|VOTE!!!oneoneone]]</big></big></big> [[DO IT FAGGOT!]] The voting to be ended on Nov 2nd with a conservative estimate of over '''one billion''' votes for Rick, moar than enough (95% of all votes in all categories) for him to be crowned '''BEST ACT EVER''' on the Nov 6th show.

When [[SFB|ridiculed]] by all the butthurt '[[fanbois|music purist']] [[BAWfags]] (who'd nominated the likes of [[Bill Kaulitz]] for '''BEST EVAR ACT''') on [http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/449876-the-rick-astley-debate MTV Europe's forum], claiming MTV was doing it [[for the lulz]], the show's producer said:

<i>"The straw that finally broke the camel's back was the announcement today that Rick Astley is the front runner in an MTV online poll to vote for the best live musical act of all time.</i>

<i>That deserves repetition: Rick Astley, the best musical act of all time. Not Beethoven, Wagner, the Beatles, Frank Zappa or even the Kitten Mincers, but Rick Astley.</i>

<i>He's not there because fat cats in record companies have bribed people to vote for him; he's not even there because MTV is the spawn of Satan; he's there because you, yes you - the Web users - have voted for him."</i>

Others were [http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/ny-etrick1002,0,5492521.story moar charitable:]

<i>"There could be nothing more "lulzy" than a net wide campaign to steal the all-time musical crown for Astley, a guy who unhesitatingly called the song that twice made him famous "naff.""</i>

MTV later posted a poll on their EU website, asking if Rick was deserving of the nomination. It wasn't even close.

'''2:36pm Oct 3rd'''

'''Yes''' - The people have spoken and Rickrolling rules! 100% (11,726,515 votes) 

'''No''' - He doesn't deserve to be in the same category as those great artists! 0% (2,477 votes)

After accidentally [[learn to|learning to Internets]],  [[Tokio Hotel]]'s faggot [[fanbois]] decided to [http://www.tokiohotelinternational.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=91230 rig the vote] for [[Bill]] by using [[script]]s and the '''iMacro''' addon for [[Firefox]] to automate voting. Because [[MTV]] encouraged fans to vote as much as they want, this technically isn't cheating. 

{{quote|so i can make my mouse repeatedly vote for them...1,000 times without even touching it >:D|THfag after taking [[Computer Science 3|CSIII]]}}

However, they had no idea what they were fucking with by [[doing it wrong|trying]] to [[hackers on steroids|hack on steroids]]. The [[Anon|Internet Love Machine]] immediately jumped into action and sent out a clarion call for all [[Anons]] near and far to [[raid|counter attack]]. 

An heroic Anon named '''Vote4Rick''' from the [[Australia|Land Down Under]], came forth from the dugout and stepped up to the plate, setting up an EPIC  [[I|fan site]] for all of Anonkind from ebaums, to [[YTMND]]ers, to /b/tards, [[goons]], EDiots, [[UG]]fags and even the moral fags of [[Enturb]]. '''V4R''' did not do this alone; many contributions were made by [[anon]], [[Rick Astley's Mum]], and [[namefag|cliche]].

[http://www.bestactever.com Bestactever.com] became Anon's HQ for the War on [[Bill|Faggotry]] and boasted an armory beyond Tokio Hotel fanboi's [[gay|wildest]] dreams, with tools which could be operated by [[skiddies]] and [[1337]] haxors of all [[Power level|levels]]. It was soon discovered by the ''LA Times'' resident [[basement dweller]] -'Web Scout' David Sarno- who voted [[doing it wrong|over 900]] times by accident before [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/10/oops-i-voted-fo.html writing an article] on it. From there [http://digg.com/music/Oops_I_voted_for_Rick_Astley_961_times it hit teh digg] and made rounds at [[ebaums]].

===Anon vs. Emofags===
While [[anon]] was busy running the epic "WebRickVoter", the [[I|Delta Force]] of [[ebaums]] began [http://www.bestactever.com/2008/10/10/ur-doing-it-wrong/ plotting] [[Iraq|unilateral]] [[rAIDS]] on all known Tokio Hotel fan sites, forums, and chat rooms. With [[learn to Internets|little tech savvy]], the Billfags were helpless and a single strike from an [[I|/i/nsurgent]] launched [[DDoS|Predator drone]] wiped them off the face of the Internets.

{{quote|Everything is [[Bullshit|OK]]. This is only [[Bullshit|routine maintenance]]. We will be back [[Bullshit|very soon]]!|Typical banner message on a TH site, after being pwned}}

As always, the actions of the [[ebaums]] squads were pinned on innocent [[anon]]s, and Billfags attempted to "retaliate" against '''bestactever.com'''. '''V4R''' was [http://tokiohotelnetwork.com/interview-with-rick-astley-spammer/ accused] of being the "[[LOL WUT|spammer]]" [[Final Boss|behind all]] of the attacks on their [[gay|precious]] sites.

After purchasing some used balls from [[Ru Paul]] and reading <i>Hacking For Dummies</i> by [[Mike Sandy|Michael Sandy]], the emofags [http://www.bestactever.com/2008/10/15/dear-th-fans-spam-attacks/ launched a pretty lame counter-attack] on '''bestactever.com''' <i>and</i> the official Rick Astley fan site, despite '''V4R''''s denials and [[HAHAHA|apologies]].

However, just as [[die in a fire|they do in life]], they [[fail]]ed it. They [[Xbox 360|achieved]] nothing ([[Computer Science 3|the web host was performing server maintenance]]) and conveniently left a shitload of [[IP]] addresses which were easily tracked back to [[coincidence|servers hosting Tokio Hotel content]]. 

'''V4R''' contemplated [[feed him to the chans|posting said IPs]] for the lulz, but a cooler head prevailed. As an [[It's a trap|<s>olive branch</s>]], he even commissioned '''bestactever''''s script gurus to formulate a script for the Billfag [[skiddies]] to use in a different category that Tokio Hotel was fagging up. A program was designed to cast a vote for Rick in the Best Act Ever category per every nine TH votes in the [[Shit nobody cares about|Headliner]] category. The fact that THfags would have been openly using voting programs was supposed to help [[anon]] in case [[MTV]] deemed auto-voting [[illegal]], which never happened.

{{quote|It is against the rules. It's a hack. Anything that involves you not using your own fingers to place those votes? Is against the rules, unfair, and WILL get Tokio Hotel disqualified if it catches on.|Melanie, [[basement dweller|site admin]] of Tokio Hotel International and [[fake|Armchair]] [[E-lawyer]]}} 

This failed horribly, as the THfags were too <s>scared to run an [[virus|EXE]] made by [[anon]]</s> [[Bullshit|honest to cheat the election]] by using [[hacker]] programs instead of manually clicking in votes [[over 9000]] times a day. They started to claim that they had never used any methods of automated voting, and that only [[Rick Astley]] was receiving "illegitimate" votes. '''V4R''' responded by [http://www.bestactever.com/2008/10/22/call-me-a-conspiracy-theorist/ calling them out] and buying up [[Advertising|advertisement]] space on a [[Tokio Hotel|TH]] [[fanfic]] [http://fiction.tokiohotelfiction.com/ site] so that he could place [[epilepsy|seizure]] inducing [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Voteforrick_animated.gif "VOTE FOR RICK"] ads right next to their [[sick fuck|TH twincest fantasies]]. Sadly, '''V4R''' caught both [[AIDs]] and [[cancer]] while descending into these depths of [[Internet]] hell, and [[Goodnight Sweet Prince|passed away]] [[last Thursday]].

===[http://www.bestactever.com/2008/10/23/we-know-drama/ Escalation of Hostilities: IRC Faggotry]===

In mid-October, '''V4R''' [[retard|naively]] decided that an [[IRC]] channel was in order and set up '''#bestactever''' on [[Partyvan]] IRC for the growing ranks of '''bestactever.com''' [[Rick]]tards to congregate, [[harbl|brainstorm]], co-ordinate and -eventually- cause massive amounts of dumbass [[drama]] with [[Bill|TH]]fags.

It is an unwritten [[ROTI|Rule of the Internet]], that everything that [[IRC]] touches, turns to <s>mould</s> [[lolmilk]] so it was bound to happen sooner or later but in this case it was sooner. It was also [[Double nigger|supersized]]. And, as always, the faggotry was exposed almost as it happened, [[scrap]]ped and [[pastebin]]'d for everyone to see. 

After a faggot [[gay|New Kids On The Block]] fanboi named <s>Louis</s> [[David]] (whose alleged [[g/f]] is a Billfag) got his [[ops]] taken away he [[PM]]'d another [[David]] with his plans to defect to Tokio Hotel's camp, help them win and [[All your base|take down]] '''#bestactever'''.

After this and various other [[cancer]]ous Partyvan [[mod]]fag drama, '''#bestactever''' moved to the friendlier confines of Britfag IRC of choice, [[AnonNet]].

==Rickrolling The Planet==
A week before the show, MTV leaked [[bullshit|intel]] that [http://www.bestactever.com/2008/10/28/rick-to-perform-at-emas-hell-yeah/ Rick will perform not one, but '''two''' songs live at the awards].

This after [[Rick Astley's Mum]] started [http://digg.com/music/Rickroll_the_world_the_petition a petition] and  [http://digg.com/music/Phase_1_Rickroll_MTV_Complete_now_on_to_phase_2 encouraged Anon to write in to MTV] to demand a [[Rickroll|live performance]] by Rick. 
 
However, after some [[jews|sneaky]], 11th hour, backroom music biz [[bribery|dealings]] possibly involving Tokio Hotel's record label Universal, Rick's invitation to the awards  was withdrawn.  Sources close to the pop legend later revealed that MTV's [[faggots|brain trust]] had approached Rick's management and offered to present Rick with his award at a press conference the day before the awards show on the 6th. 

Then they wanted him to '[[lurk moar|hang out]]' with his award in the wings at the '[[gay|artists']] bar' and have all the '[[Tokio Hotel|real artists]]' come by and sign the award which they would then auction for charity. He already intended to do this but MTV were actually dictating to him; there were no other options.

This in exchange for bowing out of the live show where -they feared- he would show-up not only the losers in his own category but [[pwn]] all the other alleged 'talent' and claim the entire show on behalf of himself and [[Anonymous]].

Rick told them to fuck off.

{{quote|Fuck off!|Rick Astley}}

MTV were then forced to laud our hero, without our hero. [[Perez Hilton]] picked up Rick's award (not that he was asked to) in his stead and best be giving it to Rick before Rick's Mum has to [[feed him to the chans]].

===[http://digg.com/music/Rick_Astley_Wins_Best_Act_Ever '''Rick Astley Wins!''']-The Moment of Victory... more like ricktory, [[amirite]]?===

A small step for Rick Astley, a giant step for the lulz.

==The [[FAIL]] that is the EMAs==

[[Image:MTVfurry.jpg|thumb|Proof that MTV is a bunch of furfags.]]

MTV, determined to please their [[16-year-old girls|target audience]], put together a stunning display of [[faggotry]] and [[AIDS]]. [[Some argue]], that apart from the chronically [[unfunny]] [[Katy Perry|host]], bland performers and the fact that [[You're doing it wrong|all the awards were given to the wrong people]], it was actually a [[pretty cool guy|pretty cool show]]. The [[anon|Rick Astley fan base]] foresaw this faggotry and decided to offer MTV a lifeline in the form of an [[zerg rush|epic campaign]] to get Rick the Best Act Ever award; a campaign that resulted in [[over 9000|over 900,000,000]] votes for Astley. This is [[at least 100]] times the total amount of all votes cast in the 2007 EMAs.

As expected, MTV managed to [[fail it]] by [[DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|disregarding]] Rick's epic vote count; the fact that he got 80% of all the votes in all the categories was never mentioned. In addition the nominees for Best Act Ever were not introduced on screen like the nominees for other categories, and, since Rick didn't attend the ceremony in order to avoid getting AIDS, the award was accepted on his behalf by [[Perez Hilton|some faggot]].

Before the ceremony there were rumors of Rick's appearance and even a performance. This could not be arranged, however, due to MTV's strict zero-tolerance policy regarding talent. Nevertheless MTV proceeded to [[attention whore]] the fuck out of Rick's nomination before the awards.

==Fucking With Emos==
With the awards out of the way, [[ebaums]]' 1337 [[I|paramilitary wing]] started looking at Tokio Hotel fanbois, [[Perez Hilton]] and [[MTV]] funny. Initially Anon's beef was with the Billfags who were [[BAWWW]]ing to anyone who'd listen that [[Rick Astley's Mum]] was [[lie|cheating]] (this despite the fact that they were also 'cheating', albeit less successfully). They'd also [[failure|attempted]] to [[DDoS]] '''bestactever.com''' and Rick Astley's own site. Howevar, after MTV's epic dis of Rick and Perez Hilton stealing his award, the [[Internet Hate Machine]] was fired up and readied for war.
