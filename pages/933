HippieDrill is a prominent poster on the [[IMDb]] message boards, who rose from nowhere to instant infamy by repeatedly attention whoring, and feeding off the immense [[butthurt]] he would face from so many different users. HippieDrill is a retard. He jumps to the defense of any ignorant classic rock fan who is getting ass raped by people who actually know what they're talking about, and he judges character soley on whether the person likes Led Zeppelin or not. Although he claims to be smarter than over 90% of the board, his grammar and intellect say otherwise. Hippie often speaks in a dialect known as 'Hipped English', which is a variant of English, but in typed in a way that can only be understood by fellow [[retards]] and [[retard|metalheads]]. His overabuse of quotation marks has become yet another way for Hippie to cover up his raging [[homosexuality]]. He's also a noted wifebeater, womanbeater, overall woman hater, queerbasher, queerchaser, redneck, and he's also horrible in bed. He washes his sorrow away by posting nonstop on the boards, making the #1 poster spot on the Music Board each week by a few hundred posts. Job well done, Hippieshit. Job well done...

Important Update: Now trolling FG as BigBrownBunny. Shoot on sight.

== The Clash ==
[[Image:HippieDrill.jpg|thumb|right|The Clash]] 
In the beginning, there was a thread where he pitted various bands against each other; and sooner or later 'Led Zeppelin vs. The Clash' came up. He then immediately made a thread laughing saying that The Clash were going to """"""""""""get it.""""""""" To his surprise, Led Zeppelin started losing and then he made an influx of Clash threads. For the next five grueling days, the board sat and watched as HippieDrill slowly went crazy because The Clash beat his precious Zeppelin. When somebody finally called him out on it, he would go into long rants about how he was the only one with a sense of humor, and everybody else on the board just has a stick up their ass. His famous 'stick up the ass' comeback may reflect the times where Joe Strummer came into Hippie's room when he was younger, and repeatedly raped him up the ass. So before he even came on the board, he was already EXTREMELY used to [[butthurt]]. The board was just the salt on the wound, but since Hippie is a mascochist, there's no harm done.

== Sonic Youth / Thurston Moore ==

[[Image:Guitar_heres2.jpg|thumb|right|O RLY Hippie? True guitar "heres" don't have numbers in their name? Thanks for enlightening us. Now do us all a favor and become 'An Here'.]]
After a few months of Clash beating, every single person on the board came to the conclusion that HippieDrill was indeed a psychopath. He took a break from Clash beating for a bit, but then immediately found a new victim; [[Sonic Youth]]'s guitarist Thurston Moore. It may have started out in a thread where IndieRocker acknowledged Thurston's greatness, or another thread that proved that the board prefered "Teen Age Riot" over "Stairway to Heaven". Whatever it was, Hippie wanted some vengence. He flooded the board with thread after thread saying pretty much the same thing, "Sonic Youth sucks, and Thurston Moore isn't worthy enough to polish Jimmy Page's guitar." Once the cat was out of the bag that Hippie was an avid [[masturbation|Yngwie Malmsteen]] fan, all credibility he may have had was lost. Once again, he did the "stick up your ass" thing, and complained that nobody had a sense of humor. It's common knowledge that Sonic Youth pwns everything Hippie likes, so the show was pretty much over---or so we thought.

== Hippie vs. Music Board War ==

[[Image:Diablo.jpg|thumb|right|Hippie's main man, Diablo.]]
The Battle of Thurston Moore, as it is now called, started something much larger, a war that would eliminate the weaker race. It was the Metalhead vs. Hipster war, and it is still being fought to this very day. The hipster side has the likes of Serge-A-Storms, and ahturkoglu (more commonly known as Turk) as generals. In fact, it has gone from a hipster war, to just a war between Hippie and the entire Music Board. Almost everyone has disowned Hippie except for the scum of the Music Board, who also judge character almost as poorly as Hippieshit does. The whole war can almost be summed up by one decisive battle, which would later be simply refered to as 'The Pwning'.

== The Pwning ==
[[Image:HippieDrilaCyberRapeage12.jpg|thumb|left|Pwning commences]]
On one fine day, Serge decided to make a thread celebrating the song "Hey Ya" by OutKast, which is widely accepted as a nice breath of fresh air from the corporate garbage the Music Industry has been shoving down our throats. It started kindly enough as people were posting their opinions saying, "I love that song!" But Hippie's post wasn't quite right. He was the first to say that he didn't like the song, which was harmless enough, but then he started dissing people who did like that song (which he would later blame on nobody being able to take a joke, ie "Stick up the ass") He referred to the melody as "gay", which started one of the most awesome pwnings ever witnessed on the interwebz to this very day. TheAceFace came along and pwned him, and rightfully so, but then it soon escalted into something much bigger than that. The people that had finally had enough with his childish antics, had decided to pwn him at a much larger level. qzg has become something of a hero around these parts, after repeatedly pwning Hippie, even diagnosing him with mental conditions he most certainly has. Nearly everybody got in on the action that day. Children invited their grandmothers to pwn Hippie on that thread.

The next day, Hippie would try to come back, even though everybody knew very well that his ass was raped, loosened up a bit, and raped even more. What was Hippie's rebuttal this time? Sheeple. Everybody that pwned him on that day was just a flock of sheep, that just followed a leader, even though everyone in the thread was making extremely vaild points. What evidence did Hippie have to support that claim except his own disorder where he can't admit defeat no matter what? Nothing. He even had the nerve to compare what happened on the day of 'The Pwning', to what happened during the Salem witch trials, yet further proving his dumbasstry.

On another occassion, the poster Penis_Stab sarcastically made an exaggeration when he was being accused of being a pedophile, and Hippie got the idea that it was okay to go around calling people names. His true character came out by saying stuff like "Fucq you fagg0t" to everyone; obviously missing the point Penis_Stab made in the beginning. For more information, see [[FAIL]].

== HippieDrill Today ==

Today, HippieDrill is enjoying the fresh air he gets in his trailer in Sacremento, California. He's also found a new target; [[Pedobear|Pete Townshend]] of The Who, and Eric Clapton. His Pete Townshend argument obviously springs from the fact that everybody in the world that matters loves Pete Townshend, but Hippie doesn't. He's probably just jealous by how he's such a better guitarist than Jimmy Page, but nothing has been confirmed yet. He complains about Pete's lack of complexity and diversity, but in a recent study, it was a discovered that Hippie is a huge fan of AC/DC, so that's where his entire argument goes to [[shit]].
And Eric Clapton to a lesser extent, but still enough to piss enough people off. Apparently Eric doesn't have enough """"feel"""" for Hippie, but guys like Yngwie do. Once again, we have an argument that goes to complete [[shit]].
