Easter-chan
[[Image:Flower.jpg|right|thumbnail|The first pic.]]

Easter-Chan is a [[16-year-old girl|young woman]] employed at Sears, who was made to work on [[Easter]] of this year. Unable to sleep, she decided to post on /b/, telling [[4chan]] of her 'bad decision'. Over the next [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|90]] minutes, she went on to tell /b/ of her plight, and before the 2 hour mark, she had posted at least 5 nudity-related pics, of less than desirable quality due to them being taken on her...'camera-phone'.
Eventually, she decided to pull out a brush and 'take requests' from  anyone with a good one. Except [[Brian Peppers|Brian]]. A [[fag|boy]] named Brian bothered her to take a picture of 'I LOVE BRIAN' written somewhere on her body for showing off to his [[Loli|friends]], supposedly. When instructed to cease and desist, [[Retard|Brian]] did not do so which inevitably angered the community of Anon assembled in Easter-Chan's board. After several [[FAIL|failed attempts]] to rid the board of him, Anon decided that it would be best to destroy every Brian they came into contact with in prayer that the one they [[Headshot|eviscerated]] would be the very same from /B/. Easter-chan is [[some argue|officially]] under [[Anonymous|our]] protection.
