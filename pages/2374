Downing Street Memo
[[Image:Downingstmemo.jpg|thumb|An example of a Downing Street Memo.  Among the things found in the infamous memo were love notes, a picture of Calvin pissing on the [[United Nations]], and a cookie recipe.]] 

The [[Downing Street Memo]] is allegedly a release of minutes from [[England]] that has caused the [[liberal]] contingent who hated the war in [[Iraq]] to simultaneously cream their jeans, as it supposedly claims that [[George W. Bush]] lied about everything and instead went to war to kill [[kitten]]s and [[Mediacrat]]. It's most notable for having been signed by [http://www.adultmoviedatabase.com/sections/features/jholmes.php John Holmes].

==Some [[Context]]==

Since the Bush Administration had "fuck with Saddam Hussein" on their to-do list right under "Remove all manchowder from under desk in Oval Office," they went to England and Tony Blair to try to get support.  The minutes from the meeting, released by [[pirat ponton]] [[last Thursday]], give an overview of what was discussed.

The problem, of course, is a lack of critical thinking skills.  [[Moron]]ic [[Democrat]] types who have been looking for ways to prove that Bush lied, focus on a passage that says that "the [[fact]]s were fixed" around the Iraq war policy.  Of course, everyone with half a brain knows that the word "fixed" in British English means "glued to a piece of paper using a mixture of glue and fluids from [[Quasidan's penis]]."

So, of course, this leaked memo has caused much [[drama]] and [[debate]] in the form of [[Internet Politics]] amongst [[LiveJournal]] liberals and [[conservative]]s, who have only deeper entrenched themselves into their corresponding positions, and means a flamewar breaks out every time sonof2ravens posts a daily screed on the Memo in politicsforum.

As if we really need the [[English]] to tell us our President's a [[retard]].
