Vampires Kiss0 aka God of Darkness0
== The Man, The Myth, The Legend: An Introduction ==
There is probably not a person ever to frequent [[Paganism:1]](please note: Heather has not yet achieved [[reg]] status and therefore only loosely be associated with [[Paganism:1]]) more dramatic than Heather. She is supposedly [[vampire]] [[otherkin]], has been known to present herself as a man when she is in fact, a woman. She ceaselessly prattles on about "dark [[paganism]]". She also is good for [[emo]] martyrdom claymation, which is her other topic of conversation, when not stuck on "dark paganism". We will now move onto Heather's various archetypes, in order to more fully understand her.[[Image:Heathersmoking.jpg|thumb|This is Heather, The Subject of our Inquiry in her Natural State]]

== The Rockstar Archetype ==
First, we are going to investigate Heather's Rockstar Archetype. The Rockstar Archetype is Heather's most extroverted/promiscuous Persona. This archetype is most markedly noticeable in the chat setting by  her self-importance, willingness to entertain, and again, her promiscuousness. Heather greets everyone upon entry in an effort to receive private conversations, preferably with females, in order to have [[cyber]] [[sex]] with them. This behavior is incredibly annoying, and is not generally well received by [[Paganism:1]]'s other patrons. One other manifestation of the Rockstar Archetype is wanton drug use(let's hope she doesn't die of an overdose while online like [[ripper]] did)and being an [[attention whore]].[[Image:Heatherbillyjo.jpg|thumb|none|This is the physical manifestation of the Rockstar Archetype, Heather takes on the Likeness of Billy Joe Armstrong Frontman:Greenday in this Persona]]

== The Male Archetype ==
Secondly, we are going to examine Heather's Male Archetype (Persona being named Caine, possibly the most disturbing, this is a manifestation of Heather's [[faggotry]]. Since Heather is a self-proclaimed [[lesbian]], she feels it apropos to dupe the world into thinking her a man while [[trolling]] the [[internets]], searching for people to victimize. Although she has been considering surgery, she has thus far been unable to grow a penis. When checked on her gender, she will either concede that she is in fact a female, or will try to change the subject.

== The Emotional Vampire Archetype ==
Lastly, we are going to determine the characteristics of Heather's [[Emo]]tional [[Vampire]] Archetype. By Far the most dangerous of all her Personas, this persona manifests itself in a myriad of ways. Most remarkably, a fixation with "dark paganism" (a form of paganism that is her own creation, and not accepted by anyone with any amount of brain cells), her endless prattling about being a "vampire", "a being not of this earth" and other various [[otherkin]] iconoclasts, and also a drawing in of victims by depicting herself as a martyr to her causes. Seemingly benign, (which is in fact the most visible trait of this threat) she feeds off of the intellect of others. Conversation with Heather will lower ones I.Q. significantly and should be avoided at all costs. Those who realize the danger generally react vehemently against this behavior and try to educate others of the peril apparent.
