Truther
[[Image:Smokingtowers.jpg|thumb|Definitely an inside job. You can see the cruise missile's smoke trail in the upper left corner.]]

'''Truthers''' are sanctimonious pricks who believe in absurd [[conspiracy]] theories blaming the US Government for [[9/11]] [[butthurt]], when it is obvious that Jew were responsible for the attacks.  While the truthers usually then counter that Jews control the government as well and therefore the government was responsible, this ignores the fact that in the end, it's still really the Jews that are the most proximate cause. The 9/11 truth movement are the hacks that realized that you could fleece gullible fools by ripping off an {{youtube|K_W_4GPw-gs|Immortal Technique song}} and calling it an ideology.

Many truthers also believe in bizarre theories in combination with their 9/11 theory, including one or more of the following:

*[[Alien|aliens]] (as well as [[m00t|Mexican]] aliens)
*[[JFK]] assassination conspiracies 
*Lizard people
*[http://www.nesara.us/pages/home.html NESARA]
*The [[Illuminati]]
*The [[Furluminati]]
*[[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy]]
*Worldwide Communist Conspiracy
*One World Government
*[[Flat Earth Society|The world is flat, not round.]]
*Moon landing hoax
*Pearl Harbor bombing conspiracies
*[[Truthism.com|Reptiles control the world and the sun is a cube]]
==Summary==
Truther beliefs amount to political fiction written by insecure faggots who want an excuse to hate authority, to feel superior to people who don't believe in their idiotic filth, and who probably fap to posters of Neo from the Matrix.  The reason they fail hard is they expect their foolishness to be taken seriously, leading to a classic case of [[Unwarranted_self_importance|Unwarranted self importance]].  The most advanced sufferers of this delusion metaphorically (and physically) have their head so far up their own ass they can see out their own mouth, accusing others of being stupid for not accepting their idiotic theories, and insisting that their fictional view of reality is correct.

Truther are several rungs below Scientologists, people who believe that gray aliens with big black eyes are being covered up by the government, and people who think they are/want to be vampires.  Given their delusional beliefs, they are in very good company with the mentally retarded and the general population of /b/ (significant overlap between those groups amirite? [ [[Doing_it_wrong | No]], [[Amirite | uamrong]] ]).

This conspiracy theory has spawned a subculture on the internet, with the result that the viral idea that terrorism is fake and instead the us government is complicit in 9/11 has spread to infect the moron population of the internet (at least 70% at risk of infection, based on numbers I made up).  This means it's important to let truthers know they are failures, to try to save them.  Of course they're usually too stupid to save and would probably just find something else to believe in anyway, so it's probably not worth the time.

The truther mentality is similar to that of the mother of Ronald McNair, one of the astronauts killed in the Challenger disaster, who was convinced until the day she died that her son had survived the disaster and was alive on an island.  This shows how the mind can embrace a lie to avoid acknowledging painful realities.

The truther emerged from anger over the [[fail]]ure of the US Government to protect its buildings from AIPAC's Jew-skewing of foreign policy (namely, supporting [[Israel|Israfail]]), causing massive butthurt and setting the stage for the jew pwning of wtc.  Because the truther couldn't accept that their government was incompetent, they decided it was instead complicit, and spent the next six years claiming that tiny puffs of smoke proved their dumb idea was actually what happened.  Unlike Holocaust deniers, who are right, these guys are really just a bunch of jewlovers who refuse to accept the mainstream reality. Their [[Unwarranted_self-importance|ego]] tends to be the main fuel for their beliefs and often annoying advocacy on the internet and elsewhere.

Part of being a truther is the belief that you're so fantastically clever that you can figure out the massive world conspiracies that all the sheeple can't see. The idea that maybe the US government isn't competent enough to pull something like that off never seems to occur to these people, but then conspiracy theorists generally have a much higher opinion of their governments than is necessarily deserved.

Part of the reason truther arguments are so easily defeated is they focus on 9/11 itself without seeing it in a general context of terrorism.  Therefore, they are easily flustered when asked, if 9/11 was an inside job, does that mean that Was Theo van Gogh,the Beslan School Massacre and the London bus bombings were inside jobs too.

So far in the test subjects examined (one but the investigation is ongoing) this just resulted in a string of abuse and a promise to "defend the truth when I feel like it" instead of any rational response to the reality that their conspiracy theory falls apart when you try to apply it to incidents other than 9/11; the Truther movement rests on the concept that there is no such thing as terrorism and that it is all a "wag the dog" style illusion.  The reality of terror therefore kills their argument every time, which makes them angry, and hence the insults.

On the down side, this means they're never going to realize they're wrong and will probably go on believing in bullshit until they die, which wouldn't be so bad, but they spread their bullshit online and create more truther in the process when idiots believe them.  However, on the up side, they are great trolling prospects, you don't even really have to try, just think rationally.  They hate that.
