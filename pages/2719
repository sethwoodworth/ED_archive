Estonian cyberwar
[[Image: Estonian flag collage.jpg|thumb|right|Estonian flag. "[[ED is slow|Estonia is slow]] today..."]]

The so-called "'''Estonian cyberwar'''" was a large-scale [[DDOS]] attack against the Baltic nation of Estonia, [[allegedly]] by [[Russia]], that caused some [[drama]]  from late April to mid-May of 2007. Though said at the time to have been the most sophisticated cyberattack evar, this claim may have been the [[Bullshit|overexcited puffery]] of [[nerds|tech writers]], who for a few crazy weeks actually fancied themselves to be '[[Unwarranted self-importance|war correspondents]]' like their colleagues in [[Iraq]]. Silly nerds...!

Though [[Chode|small]], Estonia is said to be one of the most [[Meth|wired]] nations in the world, tech-integrated to the point that it's government is described as 'paperless'. Citizens use the [[Ted Stevens|intertubes]] for all kinds of shit other than [[porn]] ([[????|'''!''']]), including [[This looks shopped|shopping]], [[GayPal|banking]], paying their [[Rape|taxes]] and even voting. In retrospect, [[You|some cynics]] might conclude that by becoming so dependent on the net for their daily lives, they were only [[Asking for it|begging for trouble]]...

==Background: it was over a fucking '''statue'''==
[[Image:Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn.jpg|thumb|right|It doesn't look like much, but Bronze Soldier is [[Serious Business]].]]
Until they gained independence in 1991, when the [[Russia|Soviet Union]] finally collapsed under the [[In the ass|relentless prodding]] of the [[United States]], Estonia was totally [[owned]]  by Russia. As such, a not-insignificant portion of Estonians are of Russian descent, and like [[Mexicans]] in the U.S., some reject the language and culture of their host country. Their lingering feelings of [[butthurt]] were inflamed over the proposed relocation of a Soviet-era WWII memorial in the capital city of Tallinn called the [[Golden iPod|Bronze Soldier]] and [[Shit nobody cares about|some dead soldiers]] buried there. 

Considered by native Estonians to be a symbol of Russian [[pwnage|occupation]] and [[Rape|repression]], the Bronze Soldier was never especially popular; the earliest incarnation of the memorial was [[For great justice|blown up]] in the 1940s by two lulzy Estonian [[loli]] (one was [[B&|sent to the gulag]] for this [[win]]). Ongoing [[Offended|offense]] was stoked in the present day by yearly services at the memorial in which [[Trolls|Russian-speaking Estonians]] would drink, sing and parade ye olde [[Communism|hammer-and-sickle]] flag and other hated symbols of the former Occupation; of late, these services had attracted Estonian counter-trolling, and Parliament debated relocating the monument to a less central location to keep the peace. 

==Fire, meet Gasoline!==
[[Image: RussianlootersinTallinn.jpg |thumb|right|Ruh Roh! Rascally Roiled Rooskies Retardedly Rampage, Recklessly Run Riot! RAGE!!!]]
Against the already-tense backdrop of vigils by young Russians (now clad in old [[Fuck you|Soviet army uniforms]]), newly-elected Prime Minister Andrus Ansip began to exercise his mandate of moving the memorial. While discussing ongoing research into the origins of the Red Army soldiers buried there, Ansip mentioned in passing some of the [[Snopes|urban legends]] concerning them- namely, that they were executed for [[Katrina|looting]] or were drunk and [[Never drinking again|got their asses run over by a tank]]. The Russian press (aka 'the publishing arm of the Kremlin/Russian mob', amirite?) sensationalized the living shit out of his remarks with headlines like [[Billy Mays|''''ESTONIAN PRIME MINISTER: DRUNKEN LOOTERS ARE BURIED UNDER THE BRONZE SOLDIER MONUMENT'''']] which could hardly have escaped the notice of [[Moonspeak|Russophone]] Estonians. 

In short, the table was laid. [[Soup]] was served mere days later, when the memorial was [[Pool's closed|closed to the public]]. Mobs fueled with stolen [[alcohol]] began [[Juggalo]]-like rioting, [[looting]] and [[vandalism]] rampages all over Tallinn, with well over 1000 arrests in a few nights. The cyberattacks began simultaneously. Coincidence? I think not, ''comrade''...

==[[Hacker|Hacked]] to pieces==

[[Image:Estonian flag caek.JPG|thumb|right|First they were baked, then there was [[cake]] (and delicious vodka).]]
The [[rape|404nication]] of the Estonian tubes began with assaults on government websites, pretty much all of them except the ministries of [[Boring|Culture]] and [[Shit nobody cares about|Agriculture]] would be hit in the next few weeks. Initially, [[Spam|junk mail]], access attacks, and waves of [[CSIII|SYN and ping-flooding]] were directed at their [[Bureaucratic fucks|targets]]  in Parliament, Finance, police, etc. These would spread to schools and certain Estonian media outlets who had urged citizens to send picture of [[Niggers|looters]] to the police.

Up until this point, this was all just an annoying [[Rage|cyber-riot]], a seemingly [[Tumbles the Stairdragon|uncoordinated]] reflection of what was going on in the streets of Tallinn. But as the government began regaining control of the situation by [[STFU|rejecting traffic]] from [[AIDS|'''.ru''' domains]], the insurgents stepped up their game and launched a rented [[botnet]] lollercaust. 

These were attacks that really brought the butthurt, over a hundred of them. An estimated one million zombie [[computers]] from countries as far-flung as the US, [[Vietnam]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], and [[Peru]] increased traffic thru Estonian routers to [[Goatse|thousands of times normal capacity]]. Parliament's [[e-mail]] server would go down for four days total, the longest [[Goatse Girl|stretch]] being 12 hours.

May 9th, the day Russia celebrates victory over [[Kitler|Hitler]]'s [[Lolcats|Third Reich]] brought the worst attacks from [[Patriotic Nigras|patriotic Russian hackers]]. The 10 largest assaults [[Tubgirl|blasted streams]] of 90 megabits of data a second at Estoniaâ€™s networks, lasting up to 10 hours each. This data load roughly equals [[you]] downloading the [[Meatspin|Meatspin.gif]] about [[Statistics|600 times a second]] or something (which would make you an ''enormous''  [[faggot]], so please don't). 

The private sector also got their meat spun; SEB Eesti Uhisbank and Hansabank (Estonia's largest) had to stop doing online business, with losses of at least [[I go chop your dollar|$1 million]] for the latter. At one point, Internet providers were forced to [[GTFO|disconnect all customers]] for 20 seconds to restart their systems. Attempts were also made on [[Almost raped|mobile phone networks]], but apparently failed, though one public telephone exchange was briefly [[Captain Crunch|butt-plundered]].

==[[In Soviet Russia]], [[Unfunny|script runs YOU!]]==
[[Image:Russiansoldierdefacement.jpg|thumb|right|Russian [[Habbo Hotel|swastiget]] for website raids.]]
[[Image:No dogs or Estonians.jpg|thumb|right|Popular Russian sentiment: "[[No niggers|No entry for dogs and Estonians]]".]]
In addition to hot zombie-on-server [[Gangbang|DDOS]] action, website [[Daniele Fiorenza|defacements]] also figured in the attack. Despite the '[[Anti-lulz|dour Russian]]' stereotype, some were fairly lulzy, for Russians anyway; the ruling [[Lemon party|Reform Party]]'s website was remade with a '[[Copypasta|letter of apology]]' for moving the Bronze Soldier and the Prime Minister's pic given a [[Hitler|funny little mustache]]. Others displayed [[Habbo Hotel|Habbo]]-esque touches by quoting [[Martin Luther King]] on the necessity of resisting 'evil'. And Russian soldier pics were the order of the day, popping up all over the place. 

Some Estonian counterattacks attempted to put the hurt on [[Vladimir Putin]]'s website and Russian media outlets responsible for Bronze Soldier [[propaganda]], but without the [[botnet|resources]] of their attackers, these pretty much belong in the [[fail]] column. Estonians fared better in toasty [[flame wars]] that sprung up on various [[forums]], largely because Russian posters had naught but [[Godwin's Law]] rants or [[TL;DR]] arguments to defend their opportunistic real-life [[Wiggers|counterparts in the streets]], who clearly prized chilled vodka and [[Hot Topic|hot threads]] over lukewarm concepts like '[[Nobody cares|human rights]]'. 

Though the Estonian Foreign Minister would accuse the [[Ebaumsworld|Kremlin]] of the DOS, various government officials would back away from the statement, and months later admit they [[Disregard|no proof whatsoever]] of government involvement, direct or otherwise. Russia acted very [[offended]] over this and began unscheduled '[[NO U|railroad maintainence]]' that slowed supplies of [[oil]] and [[Dongcopter|other goods]] from entering Estonia. Whipped up by the Russian media, [[Boston]]-styled "No [[Irish282|Irish]] need apply"-type signs began appearing in Russian shops and restaurant windows and an unruly mob (is there any other kind?) [[Cock block|blockaded]] the Estonian embassy. Estonian appeals to the [[United Nations|UN]] and [[EU]] to declare the attacks 'terrorism' or an 'act of war' would fall on deaf ears; both bodies were in [[Anthrocon|recess]] and thus, [[Yiffing|too busy]] to respond immediately. 

An unlucky Russian n00b named [[Some Guy|Dimitri]] was [[V&|arrested]] in Tallinn, but then released; he would eventually be fined about $1500 for the Reform Party website defacement. Other than that, no one has ever been held responsible for the attacks. It's not as though you rent a botnet with your fucking Discover card, after all...

==Olde media: WWIII ! !1!==
[[Image:estonia bandwidth rape.gif|thumb|right|OMG CYBER-RAPE.]]
As much of a mess as it made, it's debatable whether the conflict deserved the [[Holy shit|superlatives]] heaped on it by news writers;  contrary to claims at the time, it wasn't very sophisticated, especially compared to China's decidedly larger [[Chocolate Rain|Titan Rain]] incursion on the US. At any rate, perhaps [[horny|excited]] by the perceived power disparity between the big, bad [[Pedobear|Russian bear]] and it's [[12 year old girls|helpless Estonian prey]], they decided for the sake of a good story to pursue the 'WAR' angle, invariably describing the attack as 'by Russia' rather than 'from' it.

Some of them popped serious e-stiffys and wrote some pretty silly end-times cybershit about [http://www.slate.com/id/2166749/fr/flyout ''''"LARGE-SCALE CYBERWARFARE"''''], [http://www.guardian.co.uk/russia/article/0,,2081438,00.html '''"CYBER-TERRORISM"'''], and oh-my-gawd [http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=124869&WT.svl=cmpnews1_1 '''"CYBER 'NUCLEAR WINTER"'''] because this was a [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/18/AR2007051802122.html?referrer=THREATLEVEL '''"NEW BATTLE TACTIC"'''] - all of which should convince anybody that [[Old media|Olde Media]] is [[Old|Olde]].

==[[Bill Clinton|Put some ice on it]]==
In the end, the government's decision to move the Bronze Soldier [[Acronym|ASAP]] probably did more to restore normalcy than any [[Security_Faggotry|electronic countermeasures]]. With the [[Giant dildo of death|contentious totem]] relocated and the botnet rental expired, the drama fizzled out ; there have been no 'anniversary'-type internet raids and April 2008 street [[Protest|protests]] in Tallinn [[Fail|barely drew 100 people]]. Estonia's electronic borders are now protected by [[I GOT NORTON!|Norton Firewall]] and all citizens have since [[Buy a dog|bought a dog]] and some curtains. And under the circumstances, who wouldn't? Would you want to live in a country known for being owned by Russia THREE times in a row?
