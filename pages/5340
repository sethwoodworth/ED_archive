'''Mexico''' (''mex'' as in "Mexs" to shout out at a Mexican - [[卐]] - ''jee'' as in ''[[Hello|HI]] pronounced "he"'' since it's Spanish ''-ko'' as in [[Cocaine]]) is a giant contaminated drug lab full of chili peppers, government oppression, [[drug dealer|dealers]], [[whores]], corruption, [[tequila]], factories, jumping beans, blindingly quick mice, sombreros, tacos, [[sex]], and of course, the filthy [[Spics]]. The entire continent of Central and [[South America]] could actually be considered part of Mexico as well, but it's too insignificant for the government to recognize this as many of their civilians are dead due to [[swine flu]].

[[Last Thursday]], the ancient Mayans moved to Mexico, which was a big fucking mistake. They were savage people living a savage lifestyle; they would slice off people's [[cock]]s with [http://www.juanslawns.com/ leaf blowers] and eat them just to appease the "[[Satan|Sun God]]". They created a disorganized, disgruntled group of small villages [[Basement-dweller|lacking any contact with the outside world]], and things quickly went [[Silent Hill|downhill]] from there. In the 16th century, the Aztecs were utterly [[pwned]] by the [[Spanish]] with help from Aztec-enslaved tribes, because even then [[fact|nobody liked the Azteca]]. Those [[Injuns]] who were either too lazy to work or too busy dying from [[AIDS|smallpox]] got replaced with [[slavery|free labor]] from [[Africa]] and the [[Philippines|East Indies]], hence the reason why some Mexicans appear blacker or [[Sharron Angle|look Asian]].

The Mayans kept their own land for the next 170 years (and live there still, [[Rape|kidnapping]] the odd tourist and gibbering about the [[Guro|glory of human sacrifice]]). The Mayans like to think of themselves as [[pretty cool guy]]s, but really it was the Aztecs that had all the [[gold]], while all the Mayans had was a bunch of boring [[het]] slashfic about their [[chikins|chicken serpent]] god [[Mudkip|Quetzalcoatl]], which by the way the god [[TL;DR|Xiuhcoatl]] would have pwned anyways. (cause it's got an '[[X]]' in the name and everyone knows the letter 'X' makes everything cooler)

The term "Mexican" is also used by people who want to save time and effort memorizing worthless countries like Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua but not [[Brazil]] since its nigger/trap/aids population makes it undesirable for anyone. The origin of the name "Mexican" [[Shit nobody cares about|has been suggested to be derived from Mextli or Mēxihtli, a secret name for the god of war and patron of the Aztecs, Huitzilopitchli, in which case Mēxihco means "Place where Mēxihtli lives."]]

In the 19th century, Mexico's Government was pwned out of [[Texas]] by crazy [[rednecks]] who later [[Truth|gave it as a gift]] to the [[United States]]. It was during this period that the U.S. [[I accidentally X|accidentally]] captured [[New Mexico]], which the U.S. has unsuccessfully been trying to give back for 150 years.

Modern Mexicans are a [[fail|strange]] race, adept at computer [[virus]] distribution, [[boxing]], masked wrestling, and dropping dead due to [[swine flu]]. While there have been few examples of Mexican celebrities finding overseas success, prominent Mexican citizen [http://skepdic.com/chupa.html Chupacabra] enjoyed brief fame in 1991. And of course, there's always Ricardo Montalban. Other famed celebrity personalities include [[unfunny|George Lopez]], [[Che Guevara]], and [[The Most Interesting Man In The World]]. The main exports of Mexico include beer, firearms, swine flu, [[spics|illegal immigrants]], and [[drugs]].

[[Last Thursday]] Mexico became the birth place of [[swine flu]], when loyal fans of [[Muhammad|Porky Pig]] fucked a [[pig|boar]] with 4 different influenza strains, thus infecting half of Mexico City overnight. When 100 beaners died within hours from something other than [[dealer|beans sprayed with insecticide]], the Mexican Government started [[delete fucking everything|closing fucking everything]] to [[fail|prevent it from spreading]], after which they infected over 9,000 eurofags, and a few Jews, and has spread from [[Russia]] to [[Peru]] to [[Canada]] to [[Israel]] effectively fucking over the whole of mankind. Of course it wouldn't have happened if [[you]] had not gone to Mexico for Spring Break, dumb-ass.

==[[Christmas|Present]]==
[[Image:Mexican_job.jpg|thumb|A Mexican's "upper-class" high paying job.]]

Modern Mexico is <s>in</s> a sad, lulz-less state. In the late 1990s, the ruling [[Nazi|PRI]] government began distributing maps, first-aid kits, and fake IDs to select households to encourage the systematic immigration of the entire populace to the United States, an initiative dubbed [[GTFO|"Vete a la Chingada de Aquí"]]. In the interim, Mexico is used primarily as a storehouse for drugs, [[guns]], and whores (especially whores). It is also where over [[Statistics|90%]] of Americans dump their shit, making Mexico the garbage dump of the world (just behind [[Detroit]]).

Illegal immigrants that are apprehended by [[the man]] are invariably [[Banned|sent back]] to Mexico (or [[Meh]]-he-ko, as it is pronounced in their primitive tongue). While many favor this initiative, the resulting <s>labor</s> slave shortage would force whitey to pay the [[Union]]s fair wages for all those jobs typically filled by the Mexican, or actually getting HIS hands dirty with work in the janitorial, landscaping or lunch-serving fields. As we all know that will never happen, U.S. officials currently have a "revolving door" border policy with Mexico, meaning that once deported, illegal immigrants are free to sneak back over when no one is looking (but not when [[noone]] is looking).

[[Image:Art.heads.in.coolers.jpg‎|thumb|How to win.]]

The major [[capitalist|industries]] in Mexico have stepped up to deal with [[poverty]] in their land, though. Last year [[CIA|major drug cartels]], bored with just running shit brick [[weed]] and [[pedophiles|trained professionals]] across the border, wanted to show they cared, so they decided to [[Trolling IRL|sponsor]] ''[[American Idol|Mexican Idol]]'', in which [[over 9,000]] [[Fucktard|contestants]] have to [[Decapitation|chop off]] their competitor's heads and [[pwned|stick them in coolers]]leaving them by the side of the road to show how [[hardcore]] they are. The [[winnar]] who makes it to the end gets an 8ball of [[crack]] and a lifetime [[Assassination|contract]] for [[Sony|making music]] with [[Illuminati|major government officials]].

==Mexican Intelligence==
[[Image:Mencia.png|thumb|[[Carlos Mencia]], the Emperor of Mexico, was also the first [[German|Mexican]] to ever cross the border. He now has Mexico's highest-paying job, cleaning out a truck stop bathroom in southern [[Texas]].]]

"Mexican intelligence" is, in fact, an [[oxymoron]], since the intellect of your average [[Oil#People_With_Oil|Crisco pumper]] falls somewhere between that of a dead [[goatse|goat]] and the lube of said dirty carcass used to insert into its [[In the pooper|butthole]] by his unwashed (and [[smegma|uncircumcised]]) [[schlong]].

[[Scientists]] have speculated that the [[Terri Schiavo|brain dead]] look on a Mexican's face (see picture) is due to a complete lack of the part of the [[human]] [[brain]] responsible for [[Existence|self-awareness]] and [[common sense]]. They all are also politically and [[Nerd|socially behind]].

Experimentation has revealed that the closest any [[white|other]] [[master race|race]] can come to experiencing what the brain of a [[Carlos Mencia|beaner]] feels like is to be bludgeoned in the head with a lead pipe until delirious and on the fringe of going into a coma. This constant state of [[retard|delirium]] is the reason why Mexico is a [[4chan|shit hole]] and nothing is or can be done right in cities where these members of the Mexican race are a majority.

==Language==

Mexicans speak a bastardised dialect of Spanish loaded with clucking and spattering. Due to their constant use of the sound 'oy' as in [[????|"oy con dios"]], there's big argument over, whether or not they were the [[Totalulz|ORGInal Jews]], which could be easily be proven by the way they [[not|enter the USA]].

==Avoiding being trolled by them==
DO NOT fucking eat anything cooked by Mexicans, or [[Tubgirl|you will regret it]].

==Beaner Creation Myth==
[[Image:Bad_father.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Mexican parent and daughter enjoying some typical butt sex.]]

Beaners (an honorific term for a Mexican, one that praises the healthy tint of his skin) believe that they are the children of Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec sky and creation [[god]]. The truth, however, is that they are the half-caste product of their parents fucking (and those Mexicans do a lot of fucking, [[amirite]]?).

Many of these so-called "[[wigger|light-skinned]]" or "[[Obama|mixed race]] indigenous Mexica Azteca" nurture [[hate|socially unacceptable]] feelings regarding Spain's colonial past, believing that the Conquistadors destroyed their [[none|cultural heritage]], but what they ultimately [[you fail it|fail to realize]] is that '''they''' are the descendants of those [[rape|sexually uninhibited]] ex-cons, not the people currently living on that faraway peninsula.

==[[Zapatistas|E.Z.L.N.]]==
[[Image:MexicanPESOS.jpg|thumb|right|Typical Mexican currency.]]

[[Irl]] trolls, and Mexico's discount version of [[Al Qaeda]]. Known as [[Zapatistas]], they are what you get when you colonize a country but don't kill its Natives ([[South Africa|which is always a bad move]]).

==Mexicans are a Fertile People==
[[Image:Mexicanmercedes.jpg|thumb|right|A mexican's dream luxury car.  Only the top 20% of Mexicans living in Mexifornia could afford this beast.]]
[[Image:Prog_stations_tout.jpg|thumb|right|Voted hottest Mexican couple by [[Perez Hilton|E! News]] from 1940-2009]]
Mexicans have a proven history of having kids - lots of them, and early. How early? Recently, one in Brazil gave birth at [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,202601,00.html nine.] (Link to Fox News, well known for its journalistic integrity.) The record, however, was set in 1939, when a [http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/medina.asp five-year, seven-month-old] girl gave birth, meaning she must've gotten bizzay when she was four. When entertaining a Mexican at home, it is always important to first inquire whether or not he or she intends to have sex with you or your children, as (much like the [[Japanese]]), fornication is simply a polite way of saying hello.

It is safe to assume that all Mexican women you meet are pregnant. For each child they shit out, the US government pays them an extra $250 in addition to their food coupons, which subsequently gets stolen by a lazy, welfare-leeching niggra.

==People named Jesús==
[[Image:Fat-mexican-bbw.jpg|thumb|right|Typical Mexican chick]]

You may be surprised to find that in Mexico, there is Jesus. Not the [[Jesus|Jew nailed to the 2x4]], but "[[Doing it wrong|Jesús]]," a common male name. While the two names initially appear similar, note that the Mexican version places a mark above the "u" (the meaning of which continues to puzzle linguists), and that the pronunciation is similar to "HAY-zoos". Some believe this is actually a corruption of "Hey, Zeus" and that the name began as a plea to the thunderbolt-wielding serial rapist from [[Greek]] mythology. Others think "ú" is simply a typo.

==Mexicans in America==
There's no denying it: there's a whole bunch of corn-loving, crop circle-making [[aliens]] in the U.S. [[Srsly]]. Statistics indicate that Mexicans make up [[true|22.3%]] of the population in the U.S.A., selling taco-flavored kisses to make their way in a country that seems to be [[in the pooper|turning increasingly browner]]...

==Mexicans in America 2: The Movie==
Once in America, many Mexicans attempt to become more "American." This is variably accomplished by: buying Hollister clothes; celebrating [[Thanksgiving]]; listening to [[Metal]], [[Rap]], or [[Country music]]; [[Mr. Potato Head|always using the word "dude"]]; going to [[Hot Topic]]; [[yes|speaking comprehensible English]]; voting [[Republican]]; joining the [[military]]; and, most importantly, telling all the subsequent illegal Mexicans to "[[LOL WUT|Vete a la Chingada de Aquí mojado.]]" It is [[fact]].
<youtube>80EDjTH-V9Y</youtube>

==Mexicans in America 3: The Reality Show==
America's first choice of music is overwhelmingly (c)[[rap]] (thank you, [[niggers]], [[wiggers]] and [[chiggers]]. [[Your mother]] would be proud). Mexicans often listen to rap to appear "bad ass" and even profess to love it. The problem of not actually understanding English, however, was something of a problem, until enterprising young Mex-Americans created Spanish (or Spanglish) rap. Unfortunately, this is even gayer than original rap. It is in fact so gay that the only thing gayer is French rap, which is humiliatingly gay.  

==Mexican Weather==
As a direct result of all the lawnmowers being produced in factories across Mexico, the weather is usually hot and dry. However, the vast number of [[Taco Bell]]s provide a cool shade, as well as a welcome darkness for half of Mexico's population to have sex and/or [[rape]] in privacy. The other half, of course, are the ones being raped.

==Roof Dwellers==
The expensive (and motherfucking slow) tubes from Mexico[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Mexico] are affordable only by the richest of ricos. They also have [[basement dwellers]], but since the weather is hot as [[Hell]] (literally) and every top tier Mexican house has at least one abandoned room near the roof for domestic workers, Mexican "basement dwellers" move to the roof where they do the same crazy shit as their counterparts [[everywhere]] else.

==How to Mexico==
# Flee your gang-infested country because it is so dangerous.
# Do not assimilate into new country's culture and force them to adapt to your fat ass.
# Reproduce at the rate of cockroaches and burden social welfare system until it collapses.
# Purposefully mold your new community into a replica of the place that you fled!
# Eat beans and have more babies.

==Absolut Lulz==
[[Image:Mexico city.JPG|thumb|right|[[Typical]] Mexican city. Or maybe California. Same thing anywhere there are Mexicans.]]

[[Image:Absolut vodka ad mexico.jpg|thumb|center|Thank God this was [[fixed]].]]

[[At least 100|Recently]], the [[Swedish]] [[vodka]] company "Absolut" ran a controversial magazine/billboard ad in which they displayed a map of the borders of the [[United States]] and Mexico in the [[at least 100 years ago|early 1800s]] prior to Anglo-American conquest. On top of this map was the caption "In an Absolut World", with a bottle of vodka sitting in the corner. What this has to do with alcohol is beyond anyone's imagination, but it's not like commercials ever try to make sense, anyway. Like pussies, Absolut only ran the ad in Mexico, but enterprising [[Americunts|Americans]] found out about it and immediately felt [[butthurt]], demanding that the ad be pulled from circuit. Absolut, feeling both public pressure and [[troll's remorse]], yanked the ad like the faggots they are. They did this mainly because they didn't want to lose their American market, which is much more important to them (silly Absolut - the Mexican's drink is [[Tila Tequila|Tequila]].) 

While the incident was soon forgotten, evidence of this long-ago, brutal skirmish remains on the Internets. On the one side of the Showdown of Stupidity were the fucktards who claimed the ad was disrespectful to Americans and that Absolut was run by a bunch of left-wing [[Terrorism|t'rrist]] supporters; on the other was the equally fucktarded opposition, composed mainly of [[hippies]] and beaners who like to yell about freedom of speech, stolen territory, and all that other shit that people just start to tune out after a while. Below are some links to Absolut-gate, replete with [[drama]], [[lulz]], and [[retardation]].

==Fact of the Day==
[[Image:Space Seed 2.jpg|thumb|Star Trek [[Khan]]: Lock up your señoritas!]]

[[Image:Space Seed 3.jpg|thumb|Star Trek [[Khan]]: TV's first interracial kiss between a Mexican and a [[ginger]].]]

[[Image:MexicoConquersUSA.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Status of Mexican influx. Uh-oh.]]

Villain [[Khan]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'' was in fact a Mexican. ''Trek'' producers were trying to find a really scary [[racism|racial]] stereotype and rejected a [[Viking]], a [[Borg]], and a [[Nazi]] before settling on Khan as we know him today. In the episode "Viva Khaaan!!!!", Khan (real name: Rodolfo Neri Vela [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodolfo_Neri_Vela]) is Mexico's first (and subsequently only) astronaut, who in 1985 steals the Space Shuttle ''[[Atlantis]]'', and then tries to steal the ''Enterprise'' from Jew [[William Shatner|Captain Kirk]] after a three-century [[lazy|siesta]]. In a historical cross-cultural TV [[love]] scene, Khan is permitted to kiss a [[ginger]], an act not repeated until ''[[MILF|Desperate Housewives]]''. In actuality, there are no Mexicans on any of the ''Star Trek'' episodes because, as one could guess, Mexicans don't want to work in the future either.

Furthermore, there are no Mexican [[Olympic]] teams because any one of them whom are able to run, jump, or swim, are of course illegal immigrants in the United States.

==Sinco De Mayo==
This is a holiday which was invented by the [[Alcohol]] industry as an excuse for Americans to get totally shitfaced while wearing a sombrero. It is loosely based on Mexican history when [[France]], after realizing how pathetic Mexico is and that the water there is not safe for human consumption, called off its imperial pwning in favor of [[Africa|someplace more worthy of conquest]].
