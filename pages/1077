'''Bobby CockLick''', a.k.a. The Antichrist, is the real [[cancer|cancer]] killing the video games industry. Since his rise to CEO of Activision Blizzard he has taken every opportunity he can to shit all over video games and [[faggots|anybody who ever cared about them]]. He is in every sense of the word a Jew, milking every single cent out of any and all established franchises he can get his greedy mitts on, turning beloved franchises into bi-annual Madden-esque shitfests. It's established fact that Kotick has never played a video game in his life, unless you consider counting money a video game. The closest he's actually come to playing a video game was holding a Guitar Hero controller for the picture found in the gallery below. Oh yeah, and he also used to run [[4Kids|4Kids]] if that puts things in perspective.
