'''Tim Berners-Lee''' is [[Al Gore|the man who founded your]] [[Internets]], and as such is a strong candidate for being the [[Final Boss]] - after all, it's only obvious that anyone who created the Internet like [[God]] [[agnostic|supposedly]] created the [[universe]] is a powerful being indeed. Indeed, the fact that [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] didn't have an article on him for [[at least 100 years]] was something of an in-joke. The man himself was born in [[England]] [[less than 100]] years ago, and his full name is '''Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee''' [[OM NOM NOM NOM|OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA]], according to [[Wikipedia]].

However, he is actually only credited with the invention of the [[World Wide Web]], not the internet as a whole. This means that although he created it, along with his [[BFF]] the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[nerd|computer scientist]] Robert Cailliau and [[WHEN I WAS|a young boy]] who happened to be there at the time, the internet as such existed long before the World Wide Web. However, for all practical purposes, before the WWW, the internet was [[shit]] and [[nobody cares|nobody cared]] about it.

Note that although Berners-Lee is the [[Larry Sanger|co-creator]] of the World Wide Web, people nowadays have surely taken to the older term 'Internet', and the terms 'Web' and in particular 'World Wide Web' are falling into disuse amongst the [[NORP|general population]]. However Berners-Lee's invention does live on in [[portmanteau]] words such as [[website]], [[lawl]]. No one has ever been able to quite track down how or why the shift occurred between [[Pokemon]] first coming out, [[Geoshitties]]' extended popularity and [[Britney Spears]] singing  "Born to Make You Happy" when people still called it the 'World Wide Web' and the [[web 2.0|dawn]] of [[YouTube]], [[Wikipedia]] and [[MySpace]] when everyone found themselves listening to [[emo]] and calling it 'the Internet' again.

Berners-Lee's parents were [[mathematics|mathematicians]]. And they both still are, actually, despite being very [[old]] yet somehow still alive.

==[[Moar]] about Berners-Lee==
[[WHEN I WAS|When he was a young boy]], he studied hard at school, went to one of England's most [[pretentious|prestigious]] [[university|universities]], and went on to graduate with a first. Since the [[economy]] at the time was not [[shit]], he had no problem in finding a [[work|real job]], and this led to him becoming successful in life. [[You]] will never be as good as him, by virtue of the fact that you are reading this page right now.

However, Berners-Lee is a [[pretty cool guy]]. We think this because he is in favour of [[net neutrality]], and is all for the [[liberal|freedom of speech and of information]] online. Making the internet like cable TV would certainly result in [[Project Chanology|chaos on our streets]] by angry /[[b]]/tards, and Berners-Lee does what he does not only to make the world a safer place, but he also does it [[for the lulz]].

He also runs the [http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ World Wide Web Consortium]. This means he is responsible for maintaining the [[bullshit|standards]] that the internets are run on, and remains [[butthurt|vehemently opposed]] to any new top-level domains coming into existence, even though they will, according to a [[news]] report [[last Thursday]].
