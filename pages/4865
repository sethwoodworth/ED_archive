'''LinktheWolf''' aka "[http://sheezyart.com/art/view/503351/ Resident Oddball]" is a [[nerd|pimple-ridden]], [[Cumdumpster|scum-sucking]], low-life [[furfag]], [[internet tough guy]], and a general [[attention whore]] on DeviantART. How did he get this way? It's actually a very simple blend of three parts loser, two parts superiority complex, and one part emo, shown here in [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/22520552/ this recipe.] He spends his weekends writing romance songs and shitty fantasy stories. When he's not doing that he's either masturbating to furry porn, drawing furry porn, or making counterfeit Tamiflu. He's [[gay|best buddies]] with internet tough guy [[iRONAS]], and they both plan to take down [[4chan]] and [[7chan]], and protect the [[Asking for it|innocent]] [[weeaboo|weeaboos]] and [[Furry|furfags]] on DeviantART from massive [[lulz]]. In reality, they just "[[Fag|spy]]" on 7chan's /i/nvasion board and report [[troll]] accounts to the mods. Like a true idiot, LinktheWolf posted photos of himself torturing cats and dogs on his photobucket, and has been driven out of the DeviantART community by the very lowlifes he had sworn to protect. After [[Delete fucking everything|deleting fucking everything]] from his DeviantART account, he has since [[Mega ultra super genius|re-uploaded fucking everything]] on [http://linkthewolf.sheezyart.com/ SheezyART].



==LinktheWolf's Lucrative Writing Career==

LiketheWolf knows he can't draw worth shit, so he took up writing really crappy stories. Unfortunately, he's so fucking stupid he's incapable of coming up with anything original, so he took up writing fan fiction (even though he never categorizes his shit as fan fiction). So far he has ripped off: ''[http://sheezyart.com/art/view/171937/ Star Wars]'', ''[http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/12946738/ Harry Potter]'', ''[http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/13431713/ The Legend of Zelda]'', and ''[http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/15358555/ Magic: The Gathering]''. The main reason he sticks to fanfiction is because when he tries original stuff, he falls flat on his face.  For example, one of his characters is named "[http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/11811828/ Jesse Sapphireeyes]." Seriously.  As you can see, absolutely nobody reads or comments on his shitty stories. LinktheWolf also has the impression that songs/poetry aren't truly good unless they rhyme. Doubtless to say, he must spend many hours on rhymingdictionary.com composing his love melodies for his boyfriends.

==LinktheWolf: Political Activist, Illustrator, Homestar Runner Fan==
[[Image:LinktheWolf must die.png|thumb|Does anyone think he's funny?]]
Proof that LinktheWolf's brain stopped developing when he was twelve, just like that of a black person, is evident in his completely unlulzy Homestar Runner fanart/tracing macros. He is also [[W|anti-Bush]], just like 87% of Americans. However, instead of doing something about it, he takes copyrighted photos of the former president and tries to turn them into lulzy macros. It seems as though nobody told him Bush-bashing is about as edgy as a watermelon, and his jokes fucking suck. He also thinks that the [[Pope]] is evil and is plotting to brainwash the entire world, 1984 style.

In a sad attempt to escape the horrible reality of being a gangly, unemployed, eternally pubescent, man-child LinktheWolf draws pictures of his [[fursona]] dancing around with self-designed guitars and copyrighted music all around him. It's undeniable proof that he's a rock star-- in his imagination.
