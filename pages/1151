On December 14th, 2007, [[4chan]]'s [[URL|domain name registrar account]] was [[pwnt|compromised]], and, thus, their [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE|DNS servers]] and the [[irony|'integrity']] of 4chan.org (along with [[soup]]) as well.

Hosting company [http://www.glexia.com/ Glexia] is now doing it <s>for</s> to the [[LULZ]], too.  The pre-packed hosting account being used for the hijacked domain name [[pwnt|was suspended]]. There is, howevar, [[tinfoil hat|some speculation]] by [[anon]] that one of [[Moby Dick]]'s [[gaylord]]s '''[[CeLe|CeLe''' (aka Mike)]] is actually the owner of '''Glexia''' and that moot got pwnt by his own host.

===[[LOL WUT|Translation]]===

[[XyriX|Some fucktard]] thought it would be a really good idea to [[steal]] [[m00tle]]'s <s>cookies</s> business (4chan that is). This is -in fact- an [[SFB|'''IRL crime''']] and said moron is about to get a visit from the [[IRL]] [[Party Van]] (the [[FBI]] that is).

Anyway, the [[DIDITFORTHELULZ]] [[skiddies]] achieved this [[derp|EPIC act of fucktardary]] by temporarily re-directing 4chan.org to the [[g00ns]]-forum.net. This was done for [[anti-lulz]] and due to the fact that [[basement dweller]]s like [[XyriX]] -one of the perpetrators and main [[admin]] at [[DIDITFORTHELULZ]]- [[buttsecks|takes it in the arse]] and wants to [[brb, jail|go to jail]] to get [[Goatse]]d.

This [[soup]] has been brought to you by [[Talib&]] members [[CeLe]], [[Angyl]] and [[XyriX]], and the letters [[FAIL|'''F''', '''A''', '''I''' and '''L'''!]]

[[Image:Chan closed.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chan Closed due to faggotry. ;_;]]

4chan's DNS was hacked and incoming connections were redirected to the website http://diditforthelulz.com -- originally there was a shitty php [[BBS]] on this site (they couldn't even set up an imageboard) and it needed more [[desu]]. After ED asked for desu they started banning anyone who posted desu.

They also set up a new sub[[forum]] called [[unwarranted self-importance|"The New 4chan"]]. Posting even a single post in that forum makes you automatically a [[newfag]]. 

After 4chan was raeped and began redirecting to [[DIDITFORTHELULZ]], some stupid [[attention whore]] named [[Angyl]] called up [[moot]] and offered him a way of getting back the domain and regaining control of 4chan. Unfortunately, this conversation only further proved that [[no girls|girls don't belong on the internet]], as she was [[Fail|too fucking stupid to even name her demands]]. The conversation includes highlights such as discussing [[shit nobody cares about|cheese pizzas]] and vague requests for something "[[cancer|lulzy]]" such as fucking [[longcat|longcat plushies]]. She proceeds to [[butthurt|BAWWWW]] about how "[[Common knowledge|4chan sucks now]]" and then call MOOT the fucking idiot (lol, [[irony]].) 

This is what happens when two fags collide: [http://fuckyoursecurity.com/mootgetsraged.mp3 Hear the original call here] & [http://rapidshare.com/files/76551329/mootgetsraged.mp3.html mirror].

Moot: Hello?

Recorder: **fails to move away from the mic to breath in

Angyl: Hey moot, I'm sorry if I came off a little harsh from... our previous conversation - I didn't 
really mean it, is this a better connection?

Moot: Yeah

Angyl: Yeah? So whats up? Still going through bank statements?

Moot: Yeap.

Angyl: Is it fun?

Moot: Not really because I never open my bank statements. They just - they go and they get thrown 
into a box... and...

Angyl: You sound - you sound kinda upset, are you havin' a bad night?

Moot: No, I haven't slept!

Angyl: You haven't slept? Why? Is like - you Haven't... slept because of the bank 
statements or because... uhhh... 4chan got hijacked?

Moot: Ummmm... 'cause I'm the only tech person at 4chan, and when things go wrong it is my 
responsibility to - figure things out

Angyl: Really? So you - said earlier when we talked it's a silly site anyway so why 
do you care so much? Why bother?

Moot: *interupts* I don't - I don't believe we've ever spoken before, I didn't say that when 
you called...

Angyl: Um... Yeah, when I called about... five minutes ago - You always say you don't 
really give a... about 4chan anyway

Moot: I - I - I didn't say that when you called, I didn't say anything like that ---

Angyl: *interrupts* Look, HEY! How bad do you want your domain back? I'm just 
wondering...

Moot: *sarcasic* Oh, you know... so bad. Why?

Angyl: Because I'm...

Moot: Do you want something?

Angyl:I'm just wondering what you're willing to do to get the domain back...

Moot: What? Do you want me to like, bend down and...give out BLOW JAYS or somethin'?

Angyl: Ewww, No... that's like... *talking at same time* like kinda emo, you know? 
Thats just gross. I don't know, what would you be willing to do to get it back?

Moot: I don't know...What are you looking for? Not looking for BLOW JAYs so what the fuck you do 
want? 

Angyl: Wool (Well)... I don't know... I'm looking for a good offer...

Moot: I offered you BLOW JAYs! I mean, be more (*Attention whore Giggles*) specific 
here - what the fuck do you want? Apparently, you're not a - you're not - you find 
me to be emo and unattractive, you know - hurt my feelings here.

Angyl: Awwwwwww

Moot: But what ---

Angyl: *interrupts* I loved the sarcasm by the way!

Moot: Yeah, it's staple - how I deal with being tired and... frustrated. So what do you want?

Angyl: Mmmmmm well, I was just wondering what kind of pizza it was?

Moot: Uhhhhhh, today I ate a cheese pizza. Why are you going to start ordering me pizzas?

Angyl: ... I don't know, Do you want one?

Moot: Naaaaa, I already - I got one in the fridge. 

Angyl: You sure? I mean, you're talking about ordering pizzas, you must want one. I mean 
I could order you one if you want...

Moot: I didn't - I didn't say I was going to order a pizza, I said I HAD pizza.

Angyl: No, I said you were talking about ordering pizzas, me ordering you pizzas. 
Well, if you really want --- (Moot: Unh-Unh)...... cause your obviously (Moot: Nooooo) thinking 
about it, it's the first thing that came to mind. Whut? Do you think I'm going to like, try 
and raid you or something? Do you think I care that much?

Moot: Well you're a girl, so that would be a step up for me wouldn't it?

Angyl: I guess if you wanted... Yeah, I'm a girl - not a trap.

Moot: Not a trap...

Angyl: Not a trap.

Moot: So, what - what ex - what exactly do you - do you want in return for leaving me alone... and... 
we're - allowing me to regain control?

Angyl: I don't know, I want some something pretty fucking lulzy - it's gotta be like 
epic lulz.

Moot: Lulz? What about, a Longcat plushie? What about...

Angyl: *humphhh* (Moot: I mean...) You know, I want - I want some kind - some kind of picture 
or something, something thats really great.

Moot: Hmmmmmm

*typing on keyboards*

Angyl: That should work...

Moot: *talk at same time*

Angyl: I'm mean are kinda cu - No, I'm just saying your kinda cute. And - A little fansign,
would be a... start in the right direction of getting me to leave you alone.

Moot: Say what?

Angyl: A little amusing fansign would probably, you know... be a start in the right 
direction for getting me to leave you alone.

Moot: Well, I love female attention... so who says I want you leave me alone?

Angyl: Hmmmmmmm?

Moot: I mean, what if I'm an attention whore and I don't want you to leave me alone?

Angyl: Well then, I guess that would just make sense - I mean, you are the fuckin' - well, 
you WERE the owner of 4chan and all. That'd be in a sense whoring.

Moot: It's true

Angyl: Hmmmmm... so... are you gonna to take the first step in the right direction?

Moot: I don't know. Give me a specific, what - again, what do you want?

Angyl: For a first thing I want, I think a FULL, you know, body, 
face included, everything picture - with the words, fuckin' - "Angel ownz me" somewhere on it. 
What would be kinda amusing, I'd probably lulz a little...

Moot: Angel?

Angyl: Yeah, but it's not - it's A-N-G-Y-L. Yeah.

Moot: Ah, A-N-G-Y-L. Is this like from Bantown or GNAA or anything, or ED? 

Angyl: No I'm not from. So... mmmmm, why do you think I'd be from there? Doesn't a 
bunch of ---

Moot: I don't know. Well, who are you with then? I don't - I'm not sure I follow... troll groups, 
very often.

Angyl: I'm... kinda... with myself here.

Moot: Oh!

Angyl: But, how *indecipherable* anybody who wants to troll? So about that fansign...
I'm waiting...

Moot: I'm... going through bills.

Angyl: Well, maybe you should stop. You know, start getting 4chan back - I mean thats 
pretty embarrassing. One of the most fuckin embarrassing things - like - for the internet, 
is to get fuckin - defaced. And 4chan is getting fucking hijacked, and even worse dude - 
you got open DNS jacked! You have no fucking security on your site whatsoever!

Moot: I don't even know what that means... What is - what is, I know - I know open DNS is - is a DNS 
server, that they have there - often ad supported, your page not found pages. Uhh, what do 
you mean? The name servers allows for a DNS transfer or something?

Angyl: You don't even know do you?

Moot: I'm not exactly into computers, enlighten me.

Angyl: Wow...

Moot: I kinda - I kinda got stuck with that whole system administrator job, it's not like I chose 
it - I don't like computers.
 
Angyl: You don't like computers? How can you not like computers and run 4chan? 
Not only... I think it's a *indecipherable* that you don't have 4chan anymore, honestly - 
cause you fucked it up! You fucking ruined 4chan. Slowly over time you just picked and 
picked at it and changed fucking rules and just picked and picked and you fucking 
destroyed it bro. Why would you ---

Moot: Hey my mom is - my - my mom is calling me, so I'm gonna go. Mommies got a... feelin'. I gotta go 
through these bills hun, so I'll talk to you later.

Angyl: Well, tell you what - you better get that - uh - fansign to me ASAP, ooooor I'll 
talk to your mommy next. Ok Hunny?

Moot: Ok. Ok. Bye - Bye.

Angyl: Ok you have a really, really good night? *Mwah*....... Fucking idiot ...

===Faggotry is Srs Bsns===

[[Image:Not_che.png|center]]

The group promises to give what they like to call "The Peoples' 4chan" back to them, supposedly an overall better 4chan. The people of [lulz] held a '[[unwarranted self importance|press release]]' on their IRC in which confused anonymous could asked questions about this whole matter.  

{{co|allegedqa1|[Hide this faggotry (LOL Pirate Bay!)]|[Simplified Version of the Questions and Answers]|0|<pre>
14 December 2007 - Diditforthelulz.com gets hold of the 4chan.org domain and promises to bring the 
peoples' 4chan back to anonymous. 

Written by anonymous present at the "press release".

Q. When the fuck is 4chan getting back online. I honestly could care less about the chances as long 
as the essential idea of the website remains the same.

Well Anon9001, we were workong on the board early this morning. We had this all set up for you guys 
so the transfers would go smoothly. Safly, people wouldn't behave themselves and spammed child porn 
when we told them to wait. thats why the pirate bay will host us So we are moving our hosts and the 
page should be up by early monday morning. ((Newfag doesn't know Sweden, where thepiratebay is 
hosted, has strong Anti-CP policies.))

Q. I'm sure.. all for the lulz right ???

Yes, this was done for the lulz r0d3nt. I understand you guys want the board up as fast as possible. 
We are workong it as fast as we can. We're going to make it faster and give you more freedom to post 
and talk about what you want.

Q. Why did you refuse to follow the Anonymous tradition of imageboards and non-namefaggotry?

Well, at first we were going to try something new. But, in the end we changed it to anon and non name 
and they posted cp and reported it. There will be an imageboard.

Q. Same rules as 4chan?

Most of the rules are the same except for posting. You can post what you want to post.

Q. Conscerning your previous answer. How is that any different or better?

Because, the previous failchan was just plain gay. Cp was removed constantly, here it will stay for 
as long as you want. I don't care what you post. You're welcome to post whatever. Just be smart about 
what you post.

Q. And there's no concern over the illegality of that?

Thats all lulz asks you to do, Well, if it gets out of hand we'll clean it up. Threads will be pruned 
weekly.

Q. Are you dumping the worksafe boards since theres not much point in having them now? Giving as 
postings going ot be unregulated and all...

We'll have them. But it wont be as regulated. You're your own master. It's your responcibility to 
watch what you post.

Q. Firstly, moot indeed gave you the 4chan? There's some confusion about this. Where you stole the 
dns or were given it?

Yes, moot gave me the dns. He told me over the phone when I called him that I could have it and he 
didn't give a "fuck".

Q. Ie what you are saying you stole it and moot does not care anymore

As of right now, I own all rights an intellecutal properties and those are merged with lulz and its 
members

Q. You cannot fight the armys of anon really

Anonymous agrees with us, you come here and make 4chan what it should be, as a master.

Q. What is 4chan supposed to be?

Imageboard lol

Q. Don't you think that moot isn't serious when he said you could have it? he probably makes 
advertising revenue off of 4chan in fact, i know he does, since he has a bunch of servers, and even a 
sysadmin. He wouldnt give it up just like that.

He doesn't give a fuck about the board. Everyone knows. He has 3 servers and moot himself admited he 
doesn't know shit about computers or running a site.

Q. Second where are the servers located? If you plan on putting CP to be posted, you might want to 
put them in a remote area of the world.

We plan on sticking them in an anon hosting service. Cp won't be allowed. Just be smart.

Q. Whats the difference between the freedom of of the old /b/ filled with camwhores, furries and 
combofags between the freedom of the new /b/ ?

The freedom of old /b/ let newfags run wild and kill jokes and mems etc. Here people can do what they 
want. But if you start spamming shit, will be banned. But anything goes.

Q. What is your current plan against getting repeatedly /. and digg'd ?

Let them digg us all they want. It just spreads our good name and lets people know about the new 
4chan.

Q. My primary use of 4chan is getting anime wallpapers. Are we going to get an image board dedicated 
to wallpapers, perhaps only anime themed?

All of the original boards will be in the new 4chan.
We'll currently retain all of the sections 4chan had previously. If a new section is wanted. We'll 
have a poll. If it as approved we'll have it. Because our board is the board of the people.

Q. Firstly, what is the new managment's position on furries?

Furries for all.

Q. Are we going to get moderators who are not members of diditforthelulz?

Yes, you guys will have the mod powers. But a few of you only.

Q. 4chan is and always has been fine, mootfaggotry or not.  Why try to change it? Do you realize that 
it is going to be a huge responsibility? I mean, there will be cp floods, crapfloods, and definately 
DOS attacks to deal with. Don't you realize your actions will kill this site (if not, then just 
seriously bruise it or split it)? Also, isn't newfag just a word invented by newfags themselves? 
Seriously, does 4chan need such reckless elitistss.

DDOS attacks do nothing with us. Let the little newfags gigaload and try somethhing. 420 chan tried 
to raid us and they failed and we made fun of them for days untilt they disappeared. We're going to 
take in this responcibility. I understand what it is. I am ready to accept it. We are ready to handle 
it.

Q. Are you seriously going to allow furfags on 4chan?

If the people vote for it then furfags can come in. Remember, it's your decision.

Q. Are you writing your own code for the imageboard?

Yes anon we will.

Q. I've been looking over this stuff, and according to http://4chanstatus.blogspot.com/ , the domain 
name was stolen. Not handed over.

Moot handed it over on the phone. Do you believe everything you see? There's another board where he 
says he gave it to us.

Q. /r/ link to said board (Questioned skipped but the someone asked for a follow up to that question)

The fact is, moot does not care about the chan. He never did. I spoke to him over the phone, he 
doesn't give a shit. People will bitch and people will love it. I'm not forcing them to do anything.

Q. How long until the new site is ready ? Servers being deployed ? New Code ?

Monday.

Q. First, What is your plan of action upon receiving a daytona attack, or a reflective snmp attack? 
Better said attacks notreily filtered

Our servers can withstand any attacks you toss at us. We have gone to great lengths with our coders 
working on custom scripts that block anything you toss at us. Just remember, you aren't fucking with 
our mail serverws. You can try, but port sentry will autobban you.

Q. Do you plan on implementing Http security measures to prevent xss, image php inclusions, image 
javascript inclusions, and how familiar are you with jpeg, png, gif formats and there inharent 
vulnerablities?

We've already made sure that lfi's rfi's and zss don't happen. I understand you're concerned about 
what's going to happen when ti goes up. But don't be. We aren'ta noob hut like ebaumsworld.

Q. What security measures will be taken on your part to protect users from federal involvement? Do 
you watch the network you are on, the hops, and will you develop a custom http that will no log or 
cache address information, removing ip cache and the like from the host system?

We're moving our hosts out of the country and our boards wont cache ip's. SSL may be enabled.

Q. What proof other than, [moot] "he told me on the phone" do u have for us that moot handed over 
4chan to you? an i do congratulate you, this does look very good, i wish lulz the best of luck 
running 4chan

I record my skype calls. If he ever tries to argue I can simply play the recording as evidence.

Q. I mean you really must find soem way of clearing that up because there are still so many ppl out 
here doubting that moot actually handed it over...

[[Image:ChansClosed2.png|thumb|right|150px]]

===[[XyriX]] using [[CeLe]] ===

A whale of a [[wigger]], Xyrix is the [[admin]] [[skiddie]] behind [http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:UIifFX4QzakJ:www.4chan.org/memberlist.php%3Fltr%3DV%26pp%3D0%26sort%3Dusername%26order%3Dasc+http://www.4chan.org/memberlist.php&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a DIDITFORTHELULZ] faggotry. Howevar, recent developments have discovered that [[Moby Dick]] was working [[buttsecks|in cahoots]] with [[CeLe]] -aka the guy [[m00t]] pays to host [[4chan]]. Yeah moot pays not cele to host the site but EPIC lulz will tell us he pays colo4you, but xyrix has you believe otherwise. Who to believe - a whale or a wigger....

Working along with [[Angyl]], it's pretty much confirmed at this point after a full [[:Image:Dnsinfomr4.jpg|screen cap]] of him [[fap|'managing']] the [[4chan]] domains were posted and his aka -'''theb0lt'''- was seen clearly on his desktop. [[Google|e-detectives]] traced '''[[theb0lt]]''' (who just had his [[Skype]] hijacked...lol) back to a [[googlecash]] of [http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:C17BcKuuyDMJ:www.4chan.org/member.php%3Fu%3D865+theb0lt&hl=en his page] at the [[h1j4x]]ed 4chan under the name '''http://www.4chan.org/member.php?u=865'''.

===[[teamdouche]]===

'''teamdouche''' are a gang of [[HACKERS ON STEROIDS|'''h4><0r5''' on skittles]] that once included [[Angyl|The Bitch Who Stole 4chan]] and her boyfriend in their [[clique|tree fort]]. And like fellow [[skiddies]] the [[g00ns]], they also claimed [[12/14]] as <i>their</i> [[fail|EPIC WIN]].

Initially, it was suspected that her former [[skiddie]] crew [[teamdouche]] did [[brb, compromised]] after an [[Google|e-detective]] had found compromising [[IRC]] chat logs. Howevar, it turns out that she'd long since [[DO NOT WANT|been on the outs]] with them and actually helped [[Anonymous Borg]] when they dropped her [[dox]] on their site (which has since been suspended for said dox).

Being [[1337]] enough to drop [[Angyl]]'s dox still doesn't make them remotely [[cool|kewl kids]], as can be demonstrated below.

Reagan  Who was present on the [[DIDITFORTHELULZ]] Teamspeak server the day 4chan was hacked managed to capture a small snippet of a conversation between himself and XyriX

It seemz xyrifag couldn't handel the ownage he was receiving so tried to pass it off to his host. Too bad the anon has his grannys telephonos and planz on rapingz them.

Compare the information for [http://www.domaincrawler.com/pages/infolookup/diditforthelulz.com diditforthelulz.com]  and [http://www.domaincrawler.com/pages/infolookup/glexia.com glexia.com]. Yeah.

The People Finder [http://umass.edu/peoplefinder/] at the University of Massachusetts brings up four Michael Williams.

Also rather lulzworthy, the fact that the [[butthurt]] kiddies came back to /b/ on December 18th, almost a full week from the event only to attempt to boost their e-gos a little bit by declaring victory -again- and spamming up scat and furry pr0n. They were met only with the cold, unforgiving sarcasm of [[anonymous]] and /b/.

{{quote|I hope [[moot|muffpoot]] gets these [[script kiddies]] [[v&]]. Don't get me wrong. I hate muffpoot. But I hate stupid whores and faggot haxsors kids even more. [[Unwarranted self importance]], etc.
I love the fact that they think they're just going to squat on the DNS and make a "new glorious 4chan." As if they have any conception of how to support 4chan's bandwidth. One look at what happened to their site only minutes after the redirect tells you they are COMPLETELY unprepared for this burden. And then there's the inherent legal question. Since muffpoot was PAYING for this service, they technically just stole it.
Basically it's like a group of [[13 year old]]s who steal a van and park it in front of their "secret hideout" [[basement|(mom's house)]] despite the fact that they don't really know how to drive, they have nowhere to drive to and they don't have any money to buy gas.|posted on [[420chan]]}}
