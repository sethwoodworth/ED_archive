Inciclopedia

[[Image:tio1.jpg|thumb|Their version of a [[meme]]. This guy appears in 99% of IP's shitty articles.]]
[[Image:Wow...jpg|thumb|a typical idea from the creator of Inciclopedia. Notice the extremely smart notes and writings, he must be a geenius.]]

Inciclopedia is a [[Spain|Spaniard]] version of [[Uncyclopedia]], just too fucking [[longcat|long]] and a little more stupid. The "Inciclopedia" is the proof that Spaniards are all [[nerd|nerds]], and they read mercilessly. It's a [[bad|bad, bad, bad]] site, a complete and utter [[failure]]. That is because Spain is the outhouse of [[Europe]].

Since the articles are too damn long, even if you speak [[retard|Spanish]], they will bore you to death. In fact, the sysops encourage you to write relentlessly; you may create the most perfect article, but if it's too short for their standards, it's [[Criteria for Speedy Deletion|immediately assraped]].

Actually, Inciclopedia is so boring, it doesn't inspire you to vandalize it. It KILLS any stimulation of the mind or emotions. Only the [[Dramacrat|truly depraved]] or the [[13-year-old boy|jobless]] would do it. So go for it and [[profit]]!!!

At some point in 2008, Inciclopedia was in a net-war with Wikipediars, a kind of ED humor-styled Wikipedia from [[Mexico|Chile]]. They hate each other but they are both crap. No one cared, of course.

== Who created this [[crap]]?? ==

Inciclopedia is the epitome of [[unfunny]], just like Uncyclopedia. Actually, it's epically [[shitty]]. No, wait. It's scrumtrulescently fucked. 

Inciclopedians know it and try to justify the damn thing with templates like [[fail|"This article has a lot of humor only understood by usual readers of Inciclopedia..."]] When you see something like that, you know that the site is in trouble and that you should be [[fapping|doing something more constructive]]. 

But the [[Completely irrelevant history|big question remains]]: Who created Inciclopedia?

*Maybe a Spaniard [[/b/]] user, trying to imitate [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] and failing? <br/>
*Maybe an [[emo]] fag? <br/>
*[[Jimbo Wales|The great pornographer]]?
*Some [[Angela Beesley|fugly chick]]?
*[[You]]?
*Or maybe a Spaniard Jew? (see image)<br/>

[[shit_no_one_cares_about | Interestingly enough]], everyone knows [[spics]] and [[niggers]] don't have [[internets]].
