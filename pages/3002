Fluffer
== What is a fluffer? ==
Everyone has seen the rock-hard [[cock]]s of the guys in porn flicks, but many are unaware of how they get there. A Fluffer is a [[chick]] (or a dude, if the guy putts from the rough) that works to get the guy hard off-camera, so he can pork the star on-camera. Fluffers are necessary because coke can only do so much.

== What do I have to do to become a fluffer? ==
Show up on a porn set. You will be given a trailer hitch. You must remove the chrome within 60 seconds. Long hair that can be used as a handle is a plus.

A great body is not necessary, since the dude will only be loolking at the top of your head. A flat head in a plus, so the actor can have a place to put his [[beer]].

== What do I need? ==
A mouth.<br>
No braces.<br>
A willingness to be in one of the lowest paid positions on a porn set, just one step above the guy who mops up.<br>
A set of quality kneepads, optional.

== This is fucked up. What kind of women do this, anyway? ==
* Chicks who enjoy being used as [[cock|sex toy]]<br>
* Chicks who can't fake [[orgasm]]s as well as the actresses<br>
* Chicks who have no redeeming features, aside from their mouth.<br>
* Chicks too shy to suck dick on camera, but still need the money. 
* [[Your mom]]<br>
* Your sister<br>
* [[You]]
