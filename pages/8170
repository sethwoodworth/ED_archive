'''The Crackhead''' is a crazed, homeless black person living in [[Las Vegas]], and actor Don Cheadle’s significantly [[fail|less successful]] twin brother. He was originally featured in the Disney feature ''[[homeless|Bumfights 3]]'', but gained true e-celebrity through the [[YouTube|JewTube]] and numerous threads on [[Chimpout]].

The Crackhead begins his video with a rather excellent [[Bix Nood]] imitation. After thoroughly confusing viewers with his unintelligible diatribe, he further perplexes them by wandering into traffic and smashing a [[fag|PT Cruiser]]. Nobody else intervenes, of course, most likely because they enjoy seeing such a hideous automobile being destroyed and because the [[woman]] [[in the kitchen|driving]] looks to be about as attractive as her shit-stain of a car. And, well, it's [[Nevada]]. They're probably just glad he isn't trying to [[fuck]] it and drive it through the wall of a kindergarten.

It is quite possible that The Crackhead may have randomly beat the shit out of some soccer mom whore’s car just for the [[lulz]]. If this is so, this would make him the second greatest black [[troll]] ever. (The first being Frederick Douglass, whose “autobiography” was written to troll the South’s happy [[slavery|slaves]] by viciously slandering their kind masters.)

Every toke you take<br>
Every twitch you make<br>
Every window you break<br>
Every honky will say<br>
They'll be arrestin' you<br>

Every single day<br>
Every ebonic word you say<br>
Every claim you make<br>
Every fight you create<br>
They'll be arrestin' you<br>

Oh the popo can't see<br>
You belong in jail<br>
How your poor lungs ache<br>
With every toke you take<br>

Every dent you make<br>
Every hood you break<br>
Every smirk you make<br>
Every car you hit<br>
They'll be arrestin' you<br>

Since you escaped, gone without a trace<br>
I'm scared at night, I can only see your face<br>
I look around at what I can't replace<br>
Black crackhead fuckin' up my place<br>
I keep callin' police, police please<br>

Oh now I see<br>
Get your crack rocks away from me<br>
How my poor car breaks<br>
With every swing you take<br>

Every twitch you make<br>
Every window you break<br>
Every drug test you fail<br>
Every crackhead wants steak<br>
They'll be arrestin' you.<br>

Every comment you make<br>
Every toke you take<br>
Here come the Red and Blue<br>
They'll be arrestin' you.<br>
== Miscellaneous Information ==

Little is known of The Crackhead’s past, other than that he has been on his [[incest|muhfucking]] corner for [[100|ten]] muhfucking years. It is unknown as to whether it was during this period in which he lost his teeth, or if he had pulled them out as a youth to get <s>Tooth</s> Tooff Fairy drug money.

In his JewTube habitat, The Crackhead’s natural enemies are [[13-year old boy|e-thugs]] and [[racist|rednecks]], who, behind the safety of their monitors, promise to “run his ass over” or cap him with their gats should they ever actually encounter him in real life. However, seeing as how a firearm would take up precious space that could be used to store their hawt [[animu|loli]], and that their only experience with real human beings is seeing their geriatric parents on the occasions that they venture up from the basement, their actual response to a scary black man destroying their mother's car would most likely be “whimper pathetically and beg for mercy.”

The Crackhead lives near Las Vegas' World’s Largest Gift Shop on East Sahara Boulevard. His stint as a greeter at said store was shortly terminated when he welcomed [[white]] wimminz with [[rape]].

[[Obama|Osama Obama's]] first act as President, after painting the White House black, will be to appoint The Crackhead as warchief of the nigra hordes that will terrorize crackers nationwide in order to establish the United States of Africa.

Fellow primate [[Travis|Travis the Killer Chimp]], who was computer savvy, may have made his brutal attack on white wimminz as a re-enactment of his brotha The Crackhead's video.

Although he is a crack-addled sociopathic derelict who would strangle your cat to steal its delicious food, The Crackhead is still less of a failure as a human being than "[[Soulja Boy|Soulja Boy Tell 'Em]]".

== The Fresh Crackhead of [[Bel-Air|Sahair]] ==

[[Image:Thefreshprinceofbelair.jpg|thumb|Will Smith unfortunately did not make the Bumfights auditions.]]

Now, this is a story all about how<br>
My corner got flipped-turned upside down<br>
And I’d like to take a minute<br>
Just sit right there<br>
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a street called Sahair

In west Los Angeles born and raised<br>
In a crackhouse was where I spent most of my days<br>
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br>
And all sellin’ some smack behind a grade school

When a couple of whites<br>
Who were up to no good<br>
Started gentrifying up my neighborhood<br>
I got just one little job and my gang got scared<br>
They said "You're movin' with the bums and winos in Sahair"

I waited for a car and when I came near<br>
The bitch said “Oh Shit” before I took out a mirror <br>
If anything I can say this ho is scared<br>
And I thought "Fuck you nigga" - "Bitch get outta Sahair!"

I was up on YouTube about 7 or 8<br>
And I yelled to the camera 'Yo homes smell ya later'<br>
I looked at my movie<br>
I was finally there<br>
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Sahair
