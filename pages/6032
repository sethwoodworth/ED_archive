Operation: LOLTreehouse started on May 15th 2008 at around 2:30 am by a band of [[Anonymous]] who have decided it is upon them to stamp out the waves of newfaggotry which is killing /[[/b/|b]]/.

This is a placeholder for the 4chan final solution. Newfags beware, <s>our</s> your time is coming.

== What Anon thinks About The Operation ==
[[Image:bigmike.jpg|thumb|Big Mike]]

<blockquote>"Specially on the whole femanon thing, the name it's self sounds stupid and retarded. /b/ used to be like the most awesome treehouse ever made in which no one could just freely enter and enjoy it, To stay she/he would have to contribute to the treehouse with either lulz, pr0nz, or something you can give a fuck about, If you're chick then just Tits or [[gtfo]]. Now it's like some burnt down tree house which any hobo can come on up and sleep over in, any female can come in and say what she pleases without being put in her place or sent back to the [[kitchen]]. I miss the old /b/ as well, yeah in during oldfags but then again us oldfags are starting to see it clearer and clearer how shitty this place is getting. and don't even say 4chan was never good because you know damn well it was."

<blockquote>"manly fucking tears.
seconded. if the treehouse is burnt down, then all that means is we have to rebuild the treehouse."
</blockquote>
-Anon, In response to Big Mike


<blockquote>"know what i say? we need to knock off this whole civil protesting shit and get back to what anonymous is known for: being the internet hate machine that made people close their windows and buy dogs.
if you pissed anonymous off, chances are you would get your myspace hacked or 20 pizzas sent to your door. we are the assholes of the internet anonymous, lets start acting like it again."

<blockquote>"FUCK YES. LET'S PUT HEADS ON SPIKES, AND BITCHES IN KITCHENS!!!"

== War Plan Goes as Followed ==

1. Spam [[Guro]]/[[Pain Series|Shock Images]]/[[Sage]] in EVERY newfag/camwhore/relationship advice/etc thread - these images will energize and please true Anons, and will [[Eyeburn|act like kryptonite]] on newfags and the weak. 
[[Image:nevertakeourlulz.jpg|thumb|Onward To /V/ictory]]
2. POST [[Original_content|ORIGINAL CONTENT]], [[CP]], [[Gore]]

3. Actually use whats left of Anonymous' wit.

4. ???????

5. Profit!!!



When In Doubt:

If you can see it - kill it with fire.

If it won't die - call it a nigger.

If it can open - it can close due to AIDS.

If it lives - it can die of cancer.

If its anonymous - you can expose it and ruin their life.

If it has a number - it can be called.

If it is a rule - it SHALL BE OBEYED unless it needs to die in a fire. Or get cancer. Or be 34'd.

If it has no bits and pieces - it belongs in the kitchen.



See another fucking [[camwhore]] thread?, Like the ones frequently posted? [[SAGE]] the shit of it SAGE bomb it if you have the numbers. Saging is not disabled as stated before by dumbfags trying to stop the cause.

Feel as if 4chan is feeling a bit stale, Boring? Have enough time on your hands? Make some fucking [[original content]], Maybe from [[old meme]]s or maybe from recent lulz worthy news, There's never too much [[lulz]]

Notice a post ending in X thread? Boring as fuck huh? These faggots don't know original even if it fucked them in the ass with no condom. SAGE bomb those shits too, It may seem like little but for each shitty thread SAGED you're one step closer to making [[newfag]]s realize what is funny// acceptable and what is not.

We will cleanse our /b/ and shape it to our liking, As long as you stick to the war plan. Avoid [[camwhore]]s, Think of it this way.. It's probably just some [[troll]] using recycled pics anyway, You can probably find better shit on rapidsearch.

We must make 4chan the hell of the internet again, Haven't you noticed how many [[moralfag]]s have been swarming our /b/ lately? They give us a [[hugbox|bad name]] and rob Anon of its proper title, the [[Final Boss of the Internet]]. Make these [[faggots]] run back to [[MySpace]] [[gaia|internet]] [[enturbulation|hugbox]] they came from. Whichever ones stay have been changed (moar liek [[lulz|corrupted]], [[amirite]]?) [[btard|for the better]].


Targets:

Femanons : Women belong in the [[kitchen]], That has always been a known fact on /b/ and [[IRL]]

[[Newfags]]: For obvious reasons

[[Moralfags]]: The most annoying pieces of shit ever to come to /b/ with their [[faggot|sweet warm hearts]] and mind right ideas. This, however, is not what /b/ is about.


Feel free to add more, But the idea is to have it as a whole. The ideal goal is the extermination of such things, but since /b/ will never be completely rid of them, the best you can settle for is getting each one started on [[eyeburn|the road to assimilation]].

== The New Beginning ==
[[Image:Antianontroopers.jpg|thumb| The Anon Troops ready to go for All out war against [[Cancer]] ]]



True Anons will mercilessly avoid all [[Newfag]]s and [[Moralfags]], and the [[cancer]] and [[Gaia|puerile Gaiafaggotry]] they bring with them. Compassion will again be disdained as the womanish, weak emotion that it is, with no place in the heart of a true oldfag. The chans will be remade as the womanizing (For more information please check [[kitchen]]), Lulzy, Evil site we fondly remember.

What is Anti-Anonymous?
Anti-anons are the anons from before, who have watched as their namesake was flooded by newfags and protestfags who - attracted by the superficial top layer of /b/ - wish to associate themselves with something they could not possibly comprehend on the deeper levels. Newfags (many of whom are underage b&) don't understand that the original /b/ was made of geniuses pretending to be retards, and so they embraced the retarded aspects of /b/ and [[THE BEST|repeated them endlessly]], like mindless chattering drones who contribute nothing back of value. Protestfags and Diggfags who saw second-hand memes on other sites and then joined /b/, similarly saw it as a kind of "edgy" humorous message board and nothing more, and are not willing to accept the cruelty and viciousness that the memes originally provided a contrast/balance to.

Anti-anonymous, rather than live with the stigma of being called peaceful anti-scientologist camwhores, decided to disassociate themselves from such faggotry.

== Anonymous ==
Killing the new anonymous will be hard, but it's all up to YOU!
-Bringing back old anon since May 15th.
