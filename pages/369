Allahu Akbar

'''Allah(u) Akbar''' is an [[Arabic]] phrase for ''God is Great''. It's a word that instantly grants meaning to your [[suicide|final sacrifice]]. Of course, you must share your death with the [[infidel]]s around you for the magic words to work. Your reward for saying these words is 15,000 [[virgins]] and [[Allah]]'s eternal love. [[Fort Hood|Failing to die yourself]], on the other hand, results in a [[Liberal|criminal trial in a civilian court]]. The preferred method of ridding the world of yourself and of the [[Warhammer 40,000|unclean]] is to strap [[bombs]] to oneself.

The individuals who will attend the mosque would offer up like praise of “Allahu Akhbar”. The individuals who detonate suicide vests, behead school teachers and headmasters, [[awesome|throw acid on little girls]] trying to attend school, and fire rockets into Israel shout, “Allahu Akhbar”.|Allen West (one of [[Sarah Palin]]'s buddies) on the [[Ground Zero Mosque]] <small>which is neither a mosque nor at Ground Zero</small>}}

This phrase alone simply is the greatest phrase of all! it is common knowledge that, [[Jesus|Allah]] the [[LIES|merciful]], hates furries therefor we should all praise him and get our 9 billion virgins when we die yelling the holy phrase of all time!
'''ALLAHU AKBAR!!!!!!'''  Another fun thing to note is that if you enter this phrase into Google Translate it will trigger an automatic response by the [[partyvan|FBI]] who will immediately declare you an [[terrorist|enemy combatant]] and send your ass to [[gitmo|gitmo]] where you can worship Allah alongside all the other failures to detonate.


== Success Not Always Guaranteed ==

While blowing yourself up doesn't seem like something that would require a great deal of foresight or thought there are still those out there that somehow find a way to [[W|fuck up the simplest of activities]].  And believe me there's nothing more embarrassing than finding yourself standing in the middle of an airport with C4 strapped to your ass as 100's of people stare [[derp|dumbfounded]] at the fact that you actually forgot to wire the shit up to any sort of a detonator.  Yet amazingly there are [[france|some people who've found themselves in that type of situation]].  

[[pretend|Imagine]] it: There you are, standing in the middle of a crowded airport terminal, ready to meet the thousands of untouched virgin [[loli|lolis]] that you were promised would be waiting for you in [[heaven|imagination land]] after having screamed out your new favorite Arab when all of the sudden a fat rent-a-cop tackles you to the ground.  Sorry Akmed [[chris chan|no pussy for you]]; just the fat, fat hands of a [[forever alone|very lonely]] security guard as he cups your balls for the [[rape|mandatory frisking and pat down]].

Take [[monkey|Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] for example, he was the young [[nigeria|Nigerian]] man who became known as the "'''Underwear Bomber'''" or as most members of Al Qaeda remember him: That fucking retarded African.  One day Umar decided that belonging to the poorest nation in Africa kinda sucked and so he came up with the [[stupid|brilliant]] idea of shoving explosives down his pants and boarding a plane.  To make a long story short his [[9/11|9/11]] ended up with him being laughed at by a plane full of wealthy [[Germans|white people]] who thought it was just the cutest thing ever that someone had trained a monkey to wear human clothing and sit upright.

Of course when people on board found out that he wasn't actually a [[furry|cute and cuddly animal]] but instead a [[poor|Nigerian]] who had somehow boarded their plane in the hopes of [[columbine|killing them all]] they were a tad bit [[rage|upset]].  Luckily for them he completely failed, instead of blowing up an entire plane in a suicide bombing he found himself sitting in airport security with a brief load of plastic explosives wedged in his crack as [[government|Homeland Security]] tried to stop laughing long enough to read him his rights.

Umar [[lurk moar|learned an important lesson]] that day: Blow the bomb up first before screaming out Allah Akbar.




== Everyday Uses ==

Just because this phrase is usually uttered by [[butthurt|butthurt]] sandniggers right before they literally explode with rage doesn't mean that [[you|you]] can't find ways to use it in your everyday life.  In fact "Allah Akbur" can be [[pokemon|super effective]] in almost any situation when properly used.  Here are some suggestions on when to best use it for maximum results:


*While waiting in line at the DMV
*After being arrested for carrying a concealed weapon
*During court
*After the partyvan shows up
*In a crowded airport (Bonus points if you're naked while doing so)
*Children's parties
*Daycares or schools


In fact, [[truth|truth be told]], you can pretty much scream it anywhere and get [[prison|results]].  Just remember to do so loudly and look as pissed off as possible when you do.  It also helps if you haven't shaved for a few weeks and if you're dark skinned.
