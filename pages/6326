By day, {{youtube2|pekiti|pekiti}} is a mild-mannered, even-tempered website developer, but on [[YouTube]], he becomes transformed into a knife-wielding, gun-toting expert in kicking ass. He currently has 56 videos showing his combat prowess with a variety of guns and knives. His opponent of choice is a roughly human shaped piece of cardboard held in place by two pieces of wood. Sometimes when he gets really ballsy he'll occasionally take on an unopened can of Coors Light, or an uppity Duraflame log that got too big for it's britches.

==Coors VS X==
Pekiti has uploaded a series of videos where he pits himself against unopened cans of Coors Light. He uses a variety of weapons in most of them, but also has an "unarmed" version where it's just "mano y cano".

==The [[dumb|Good]], The [[lame|Bad]], and the [[retarded|Ugly]]==
Although pekiti has thoroughly shown that it's completely [[stupid|acceptable]] to bring a knife to a gun fight, he's also skilled with handguns as well. He's particularly adept at using handguns in close quarters.
