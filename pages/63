Most everyone would rather forget [[2008]] altogether and [[ED]] is no exception. Between all the unfunny and shit hitting the fan [[IRL]], however, were plenty of lulz, drama and Internets to keep the [[snugglenet]] grinning like a batshit crazy [[Joker]]. There are 8,000,000 stories in the virtual city; these are just some of them.
