Internet trial
{{Elaw}}  
When [[internet drama]] plays out in a public form or, more commonly, the accuser's [[crazy|head]], resulting in declaration of [[internet guilt]] of they accused.  Usually the accused is [[lollercoaster|riding the lollercoaster]] and their friends [[bait]] and [[troll]] the [[insane]] person.  Occasionally, some [[homosexual|faggot]]s will speak up in support of the accuser.  These people are frequently [[furries]] or [[plushie|plushies]], with the occasional [[voraphile]].  The reason for this has yet to be determined.  Several notable cases have resulted in internet restraining orders.
