==Life At Home==

MJ originally constructed for himself the perfect [[tool]] for drawing in his preferred cuisine: an amusement park where children "never grow up" and "[[DO NOT WANT|don't want]] to go to school". It was his primary romp for years until people realized that a grown man running a theme park for children all by himself was a little [[creepy]]. Jacko closed his own pool after his rape trial, moving back to [[Whore]]lywood with the intent to rebuild his fondle-factory in Berlin. Just thinking about plump little [[Prussian Blue|blue-eyed blond-haired Nazi children]] made Jacko drool so much his lips fell off: it was that or too much plastic surgery and amazing [[gay|buttsecks]] with Macaulay Culkin whom he had [[molested|fiddled]] the hell out of for many years after his copy of "Home Alone" on VHS(a.k.a. Exhibit C) became recognizable only as the worlds most valuable container of Jacko [[spooge|spunk]].

He lived with his a myriad of prepubescent servants and his [http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2007/10/09/2007-10-09_michael_jackson_nanny_fighting_lupus_alo.html Nanny with lupus]. [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Poland#Tourism He has also expressed his wish to move to Poland] and live in a castle purchased there, although he may have been unaware that the country's demographics were not ideal, having fewer young boys than girls.

=="Thriller" or "I'm a [[pedobear|pedophile]], put me in jail"==
[[Image:Wackojacko.jpg|thumb|200px|right|This is a picture from his music video, "Thriller". Also known as one of the last times he needed makeup to look like a zombie.]]
Years before Jackson was first accused of liking kids too much, he recorded a [[WIN|HIT]] album where all his plans and intentions where clearly stated. The album was released by [[EPIC|Epic records]] (for real) but before they released the album they decided to change some of the title songs, so as to make Jackson's intentions less obvious. '''Bolded''' are the words that were deleted:
# "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' '''With That Young Boy'''" – 6:02
# "Baby '''boy''' Be Mine" – 4:20
# "The '''Underage''' Girl Is Mine" – 3:42
# "Thriller" – 5:57
# "'''I'll Show You How To''' [[Masturbation|Beat It]]" – 4:17
# "Billie Jean: '''An 8 Year Old Can't Be Pregnant'''" – 4:57
# "Human Nature: '''I'm Just God's Messenger'''" – 4:05
# "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)" – 3:58
# "The '''Lil'''' Lady in My Life" – 4:12
# "Another Part of Me '''In Your No No Hole''''" - 3:54
# "I Just Can't Stop Loving You '''That is, till you're 21''''" - 4:13
# "The Way You Make Me Feel '''May be different to the way I make you feel''''" - 4:57

==The Elephant Man==

Jackson was also an [[Trolling IRL|IRL Troll]] and had created many "false" stories about himself, apparently to see if he could "control" the media, a plan that would unfortunately backfire on him. [[LOL WUT|such as sleeping in an oxygen chamber to prolong his life, and buying a sex toy]]. Another notable event occurred in the [[1980|Mid-1980]]'s where Michael Jackson tried to purchase the skeleton of Joseph Merrick, aka the Elephant Man. He ultimately failed to obtain the skeleton. When asked the reason for his fagging, Michael Jackson stated that "it was mostly for the [[lulz]]". [[Some argue|People suspect]] however, that it was in fact not for the lulz but for [[necrophilia|other recreational activities]].

==Movie Career==

In addition to starring in '''Moonwalker''' and hundreds of music videos, at the time of his death, Michael Jackson was in pre-production on a prequel to Hustler's popular '''Barely Legal''' series. 

==Bubbles==
{{quote|Now that he's dead, who's gonna blow Bubbles?|[[Anon]]}}

{{tinyquote|Bubbles is more fun than a lot of people I know. I saw Bubbles at a wedding in a tux. He has great table manners.|Quincy Jones|[[truth|defending chimpmongling]]}}

After failing to secure a [[negro|bag of bones to stick his dick into]], Jacko purchased a chimpanzee called Bubbles to stick his dick into. As is well known, chimps love nothing better than to sit around masturbating between displays of faeces hurling and Jacko thought that slipping his own dick (which was not yet white and hairless) in would be a cinch. At first it was, so Bubbles became an entourage of one, Jacko's confidante and [[BFF]], accompanying him to [[torture|recording sessions]] and music videos shoots. On the road they shared a hotel bed and Jacko's wardrobe. 

Life at home was sweet for both primates, with Bubbles and Jacko sharing a bedroom at [[Gaia|Neverland]]. Bubbles was fully toilet trained and allowed to use Jacko's private crapper but was often seen sitting in a crib wearing a diaper to satisfy Jacko's [[infantilism|diaper fetish]]. 

Sadly, in 2003, Bubbles was kicked to the curb after his [[shota|little hand]] grew too big for the [[pedo|big hand]] -anyone watching Law & Order: SVU know that this is classic pedo behavior. Also, with the arrival of Jacko's first [[IRL]] child, Prince Michael 1, Bubbles had outlived his usefulness.

Jacko justified the breakup and dumping Bubbles on the chimp's overly aggressive love making style where Bubbles had reversed his traditional position as the '[[masochist|<i>bottom</i>]]' in sexual relations to being the '[[sadist|<i>top</i>]]'. [[TL;DR]], Bubbles was now [[buttsecks|assraping]] Jacko as opposed to Jacko assraping Bubbles. 

Jacko blamed [[Prince]] [http://prince.org/msg/7/38797 claiming that] he had used [[ESP]] to turn Bubbles batshit insane saying: 

{{tinyquote|"[[Jacko|What kind of sicko would mess with a monkey?]] This is the final straw. Poor, poor Bubbles."|Jacko}}

Today, Bubbles has lived at many places since his failed attempt to assassinate Prince Michael and failed attempt to [[an hero]]. He lives in an animal sanctuary where he has a new best friend, [[Assrape|Sam: A 40 Year Old Chimpanzee nicknamed Bubba. Now Bubbles will have many nights of tender tender love making, just like the old days]].

In a special by Animal Planet, sister La Toya Jackson came to visit the chimp and exchanged tearful words. Yes, she is actually talking to a monkey...

'''To a monkey'''

==Early Life==

Jackson's early life was full of [[child abuse|moonbeams and happy times]]. Father, Joe Jackson, would give all Jackson children encouragement to pursue their [[pedophile|dreams]] and [[jailbait|desires]] by having hurtful buttsecks that left a deep impression on young Michael.

==Pedo Trials: Part 1 of 2==
[[Image:HomeAloneMJ.jpg|thumb|In his prime.]]
[[Image:Alien-vs-predator-michael-jackson.jpg|thumb]]
In 1993, Jacko was tried for being a [[pedo]] after a [[13-year-old boy]] called '''[[An_Hero|Jordan Chandler]]'''(nickname Rubba aka that kid with the lying faggot of a dad that makes it possible to make fun of Jacko <3) accused him of putting the big hand on the little penis, kissing him, [[fapping]] and oral sex, with a detailed description of Jacko's junk. His info was so precise, he even pinpointed where the vitiligo splotches were, the length of the performer's pubes and that he was Jew. While he was in Monaco to be given 8 more awards at the World Music Awards. he was sitting next to the Prince of Monaco with Jordan on his lap, bouncing him in his knee whispering RUBBA into his ear. Yet no one even Monaco Royalty thought this was WRONG. He was bouncing a 14 year old boy on his knee and no one except for a few from his team though this was wrong.

Jacko, being too much of a pussy to have a trial, settled the case by giving the accuser's family over 20 million dollars. Some say that this was proof of him being guilty. Others say that he couldn't have a trial because of his health (SPOILER: He was an addict). Now, had this been the extent of Jacko's allegations people would have left him alone, but the damn bastard couldn't stop himself from having...

==Pedo Trials: Part 2 out of 2==
{{quote|Get accused of molestation ONCE and we can let it slide, but twice? Nigga, what the fuck were you thinking?|Chris Rock}}
After making a jackass of himself in a documentry, Jacko gets accused of more molestation in 2003. This was the final blow to his career. The accuser was a former cancer patient who had his [[Pwnt|spine removed]] at a young age and his final words were to Michael Jackson. His wish came true and while he was said to be ready to die in a few weeks. But after he met Michael, he's saved. Michael Jackson sucking your cock = the cure for cancer.

A trial ensued (for once) and it ended with Jacko being found <s>guility</s> innocent, before being told to gtfo to Bahrain. Only god knows what really happened ''there''...

Note how Jacko was accused of all this in 1993 and again in 2003. It was ten years before and after. So, if Jacko lived to see 2013...

==Jacko's Kids==
Michael Jackson's kids (the ones he ''had'' as opposed to the ones he '''had'''), who are all completely white, are [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/michael-jackson/5706071/Michael-Jackson-not-biological-father-of-his-children.html not his biological children] (OBVIOUSLY). In fact, the biological father is widely known to be Mark Lester, the blond-haired former child actor who played Oliver in a [[gay]] musical movie.

Looking at Lester's childhood photo, which seems to fit the image of Jackson's ideal sex partner, one has to wonder what Jacko's children were being used for exactly.

Moreover, it appears that not only did Jacko not sire even one of his children, he never formally adopted them either. ED hopes that he will be posthumously prosecuted for kidnapping. [http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/07/01/michael-jacksons-will-filed-in-court-neverland-memorial-unlikely/ In his will], he left custody of <s>his</s> the kids to [[Sheneequa|Diana Ross]].

==The Mask of Pedo==
On December 13th, 2008, Michael Jackson reappeared in the spotlight using an [[nice try|old trick]] from Elizabeth Taylor/Liza Minnelli to gain sympathy from his fans by faking a mental illness. This time it took the form of what could be best described as dressing up like a Bollywood version of Zorro.

=='''This Is [[shit|It]]!''': The Comeback==
[[Image:Jacko_hulk.jpg|thumb|Jacko trains with the [[Hulk]] for his one city 'tour'.]]
{{quote|When I say this is it, it really means this is it.|Jacko, exposing himself in front of millions of horny fans|March 2009}}

In March 2009, Jacko announced that he would be playing live again for the first time in 12 years with a 50 date residence at [[Londonistan]]'s '''O2''' arena starting in July. Strapped for cash and [[attention]], he planned to revive his [[dead|catatonic]] career and make hueg amounts of [[Jew Gold]] to pay off his mountain of debt. He also needed fresh, young meat to feed his ravenous appetite for [[shota]]; since his kids had grown so old they now revolted him so much he'd stopped getting protein from them and was so incredibly [[pro-ana|frail and underweight]] that nobody really noticed, since he always looked like that.

With a cash advance from the '''O2''' and a firm of [[jews|venture capitalists]] called '''AEG''' he set about trying to get into shape for the gruelling '''tour'''.  He rented out [[LA]]'s Staples Center for full dress-rehearsals and hired [http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/2481286/Michael-Jackson-is-being-trained-by-Lou-Ferrigno.html the Incredible Hulk] to whip him into shape. The rehearsals were filmed and <s>will probably be</s> have been fashioned into a sloppy motion picture. Jacko's attention seeking family claimed that a body double was used, but nobody gave a shit. As nobody gave a shit about the movie to begin with.

=== THIS IS WIN===
It is now reported that SONY and AEG, in an attempt to cash in on Jacko's post death sales jump and salvage what they invested in jacko for this tour. Are going to through the magic of editing going to cobble together 80 hours of footage shot during the rehearsals of the tour to make a probably nowhere near coherent film about Jackson's final days. The price tag of the film is already reported to be at least $50 million.

[[Image:Jjj.jpg|thumb|right|OH SHIT HES BACK!]]
On Thursday, June 25th, 2009, Michael Jackson died in the act of lovemaking, having a [[HNNNNNNGGGGG|heart attack]].  This is considered one of the best ways to go, preferable to rotting in an old folks home or dying of cancer.  The young boy who Jackson was making love to at the time called paramedics; his name was not released.  Most news agencies omitted this fact, leaving a mystery of who called paramedics when Michael Jackson was unconscious at the time. Regardless, Jacko was clearly [[I'm on my bee|not on his bee]].

The  compassionate, humanitarian brain-trust /[[b]]/ was quick to exploit it with endless threads featuring the [[HNNNNNNGGGGG|heart attack]] meme and Michael Jackson photoshops. His dying wish was to donate his [[cock|organ]] to a sick child (so that his [[Penis|organ]] would forever be inside a child).

[http://www.tmz.com/2009/06/25/michael-jackson-dies-death-dead-cardiac-arrest TMZ] reported the initial diagnosis was that Jacko had died from [[HNG|cardiac arrest]] caused by a massive cocktail of drugs including Dilaudid, Vicodin, Soma, Xanax, Zoloft, Paxil for anxiety and heartburn pill Prilosec administered by a black person doctor. The Los Angeles coroner's office has deferred Jacko's inquest awaiting toxicology tests and to provide ample time for the media shitstorm to rage on for a week or two. Shortly thereafter, [[Jesse Jackson]] appeared on [[CNN]] calling for a full and thorough investigation of [[drugs|the facts]] and Jacko's live-in doctor (who it was reported, had gone on the lam) suggesting that this was <big>MURDER!</big> He then called for [[OJ]] to be released from jail since he's an expert in tracking down the [[CIA|real killers]]


While it has since been confirmed that he had a heart attack in E.R., initial reports were of a stroke in the Pediatrics wing.


Meanwhile [[CNN]] reported Vanillaface moonwalked off this mortal coil. [[Goodnight sweet prince]]. [[Fark]] reported that he had just begun work on ''Thriller 2: Electric Boogaloo!'' Though his heart is no longer beating, Disney has inspected the body and declared that the high quality plastic exterior makes him a great candidate for animatronics. The same news report told how he was planning to rekindle his popularity, but the only thing he accomplished was becoming the first white black person [[an hero|to die of something besides gunfire]].

Now that sick fuck Jackson is dead, it is impossible to determine exactly how many Hundreds or possibly even Thousands of children he victimized at the neverland ranch, as well as elsewhere.

On 28 August, 2009 a Los Angeles Coroner ruled the death of Michael Jackson a [[AIDS|homo]]cide[http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/08/28/jackson.autopsy/index.html].

The [[jews|media]] being the two-faced, money grubbing scum that they are, all of sudden had a new found respect for Michael Jackson. It turns out after [[Lulz|making many cruel jokes at his expense, stealing as much of his money as they could, and publicly humiliating him]], [[Troll's remorse|they decided to just sweep all the nasty things they said under a rug and act like it never happened]].  As overwrought, outpourings of unconditional love for the Gloved One rained down upon the masses from all and sundry, /[[b]]/ remained the sole voice of reason in [[lulz|the tragedy]], celebrating this living embodiment of [[Shotacat]]'s life and death, creating [[kthxbye]]s in their [[macros|inimitable style]]. Meanwhile faggotry reigned the day on the likes of [[twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[facebook]] and blog after blog after blog.

Everyone seemed to have forgotten how [[shocked & appalled]] they were back when Jacko was on trial for diddling [[shota]]. People posted tributes and childhood memories, songs and vidyas of how important '''The King of Pop''' had been in their lives and how he'd provided the soundtrack to the indiscretions of youth; that first mugging (Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'), that first [[fap]] (Beat It), that first child molestation (Pretty Young Thing).

[[Godwin's Law|It's almost as if they could]] -maybe- one day overlook [[The Holocaust]] and give another tortured artist with issues -[[Hitler]]- the props he surely deserved for being an inspiring leader, a terrific orator, a non-smoking [[dogmongler|animal lover]] with a keen eye for graphic design and style who also got the trains to run on time. One can only hope.

MJ cockmonglers have responded by locking themselves in cupboards, self-mutilation, MJ tattoos, and BAAAAWWWING about how the world is a cruel and violent place; [[Muslims| subsequently expressing the desire to assault people who don't think or act as they demand.]] Scientists have concluded that the universe revolves around these [[aspies|illiterate specimens]].

[[Image:Image-Trolling facebook.png|thumb|[[Godwin's Law|For the (God)win!]]]]
[[Image:Headline.jpg|thumb|right|[[Typical]] British headline.]]
In the meantime, [[you]] can help by trolling people on the Internets with mock outrage at all this praise for Jacko and comparing him to Hitler. Go to someone's virtual [[facebook]] shrine and leave comments to ''their'' comments feigning disgust that someone would sweep Jacko's [[pedo|crimes against humanity]] under the rug. Tell them they probably spent MJ's pedo trial damning him to Hell and if not, ask them if they would let their kids sleep over at [[basement|Neverland]] or hang out with [[Josef Fritzl|Uncle Josef]]. Tell them that Hitler was a brilliant [[Vince|motivational speaker]] and a seriously snappy dresser. 

Most people won't take the bait because they know it's true: Jacko was a [[sickfuck]]. But some will puff up their e-chests and rise to the defense of MJ. Now you pounce and accuse them of hypocrisy and double standards. Ask why they hate children so much and how come pedophilia is okay when the molester is a celebrity. If they [[BAW|BAAAAAW]] that you're out of line or whatever, admit that, yes, you're sorry, comparing MJ to Hitler is terribly unfair to Hitler.

Another effective trolling technique is to liberally apply [[shocked & Appalled|mock outrage]] at both the fact that he is to be memorialized and that the huge tribute is to be paid for by your hard-earned tax dollars. Since the [[Arnold|State of Collyfornia]] is now [[bailout plan|bankrupt and issuing IOUs to pay for most services]] this adds [[flame|fuel to the fire]]. It has been estimated that police overtime needed for security at the memorial in downtown LA will cost $2,000,000 alone and ''[[you]]'' are going to be paying for it.

Now I begin to insert a mace-like needle, grafted from the claws of Cthulu, that has been laid on the surface of lava from Mount Doom into your urethra. Michael Jackson has gone into Terry Schiavo mode. He has to live out the rest of eternity in agony without the privilege of resisting his maker.  Your friends and family can't save you Michael.

==[[Perez Hilton]], first responder==

As news of Jacko's death reached [[Perez Hilton]], Perez set about what Perez does best:  showing that, as gay as he gets, he can ALWAYS get even gayer. He made a blog post claiming that Jacko was just faking it to get out of contractual obligations. This caused abundant butthurt and threats of violence so Hilton tried to backtrack and [[trolls remorse|apologise]] for the fag-on-fag violence. This wasn't enough for some misguided, gay anons who called for a raid on Hilton (see: [[Talk:Michael Jackson]]). ED awaits the fallout from this gay Operation Thriller faggotry and leading expert [[tfo]] will bring you news as and when it happens.

[[Image:Mj glove.jpg|thumb|right|[[Domestic_violence|Does the King of Pop need to smack a bitch?]]]]

===Pepsi did it===
PepsiCo. tried but failed to defoliate Jacko's [[Don Imus|nappy head]] with napalm [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZnUI8tfKjg during the filming of a Pepsi commercial] in the '[[80s]], so Jacko turned to the painkillers from which would eventually be similar to the rumors of him taking drugs that led to his death. Also, when the contract ended with him, Pepsi's stock market did fall for a while. Ergo, Pepsi did it.

===Rock Band did it===
''Rock Band Unplugged'' had the song "ABC" by The Jackson 5 on it. Michael Jackson was 11 when the song was released. 11 days after the release of the game, he died.

===Jews did Michael Jackson death!===
[[Image:Michael-jackson-the-muslim-perv.jpg|thumb|Abu Joe trollin Jews]]
[[Image:Michael_Jackson_Holding_Israel_Flag.jpg|thumb|Jacko surrenders to [http://www.yoyenta.com/?p=1035 appease the Jews]]]
To get back at [http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/856313/posts Michael Jackson putting a "Voodoo curse" on Supreme Jewish Leader Steven Spielberg], a day before his [[IRL]] [[death]], upon entrance into an [[IRC]] channel, a Jew compulsively typed in "ah Michael Jackson, ah what?" Given the fact that this Jew has tha [[OCD]], he has [[DBZ|special powers]], effectively putting a curse on Jacko and [[killing]] him.

===[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASUS_12/2460_12.asp Jews did Michael Jackson!]===
{{quote|Michael Jackson has an anti-Semitic streak and hasn’t learned from his past mistakes. It seems every time he has a problem in his life, he blames it on the Jews.|[[ADL]]}}


Some [[Thatkidparker|people]] do believe that Jews did Michael Jackson, and not just because [http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUKTRE55P0Q520090626 he owed] them [[jew gold|$500,000,000]]. Their reasoning goes as follows:
[[Image:Michael-Jackson-and-Adolf-Hitler.jpeg|thumb|Michael Achtung]]
::1. Jewish monetary perverts drool at the billions accumulated by MJ. They say [[hello|shalom]] and try to invite themselves to dinner and MJ says "[[GTFO]]."
::2. In addition, Jews at the [[CIA]] want to insert [[memes]] into his lyrics so that they can sell more dope to the listeners. MJ says "[[gb2]]hell."
::3. Jews insert bait children into his life. Indeed, some of the children's families were [[bff]] with their Jewish attorneys.
::4. MJ smells trouble, and responds with lyrics. Jewish lawyers made him change it. The song is accompanied by creepy music that gives you visions of Jewish shark lawyers trying to [[banhammer]] you for good. The unedited version of one of his lyrics went as follows ([[srsly]]):

::::''Jew really fucked''
::::''Jew thought he really got control of me''
::::''Jew out there,''
::::''Jew really wants to get me''
::::''Kick me''
::::'''''Kike me'''''
::::''Use me''
::::''[[Pedo|Abuse]] me''
::::''Sue me''
::::'''''Jew me'''''
::::''Take control of me''

::5. Jews never find anything funny if it is at their own expense so proceeded to banhammer him. They fail at the banhammer but succeed in putting him out of commission.

A related theory is that the music biz did Jacko for revenge. His last studio album [[irony|''Invincible'']] in 2002 had tanked and Jacko had gotten into a [[butthurt|heated dispute]] with his label [[Japan|Sony]] and [[jewed|leveraged]] himself out of his contract after accusing them of failing to spend sufficient [[jew golds]] marketing and promoting him. Of course this had absolutely nothing to do with his refusal to go on tour in support of the record. Jacko and the head of the label went toe-to-toe in the media and Jackson alleged the label head was a [[white|"devil" and a "racist"]] who did not support black artists and used them solely for [[profit]] ([[no shit]]). He charged that the label chief had called his pal Irv Gotti a "fat nigger."

===[http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2009/06/23/sanford-disappears-to-hike-appalachian-trail-on-naked-hiking-day/ Mark Sanford] did it===
After getting busted for going AWOL from his day job as the Governor of South Carolina, [[Republicunt]] "family values" fanboy [[Mark Sanford]] (described by [[Stephen Colbert]] as "incredibly boring ... a manila envelope glued to a beige wall... a walking, talking [[Sleep sex|Ambien]]") admitted he was off in Buenos Aires having an extramarital affair with a <s>spicy</s> moderately attractive [[Argentinian]] chica and [[NOT]] on a surprise solo hike on the Appalachian Trail (on Naked Hiking Day). Naturally, the old media went batshit crazy and had pwnta field day at the Governor's expense and were set to drag all the skeletons from Sanford's suddenly interesting closet.

However, on the eve of blowing the lid off the secret lovers' steamy emails and such, Michael Jackson suddenly dropped dead. With a shot at being the [[GOP]]'s [[2012]] presidential candidate on the line, things were not looking good for the aging Lothario ... until the spotlight shifted. Coincidence? You be the judge.

===[[Iran]] did it===

Following the hotly desputed re-election of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], Iranians [[protest]]ed the results as the vote was the one shred of [[freedom]] they thought they still had. They even went as far as condemning the Supreme leader which is apparently a big no-no. The American and other Western news media would closely observe this [[RAGE]] throughout the following weeks. '''[[ALL CAPS|YES THE MEDIA WAS REPORTING ACTUAL FUCKING NEWS FOR ONCE]]'''.

Fearing that continual coverage of the protests would weaken the [[Islamic]] leadership, they needed something seriously ''[[Epic]]'' to divert Western attention, which was Jackson's record producer.

===AEG Insurance Scam?===

[http://www.cinemassacre.com/new/?p=1654#comments/ TMZ] reports that AEG who funded the Jacko "This is It" tour paid for a hefty insurance policy from Loyds of London covering among all things '''DRUG OVERDOSE'''.

===Farrah Fawcett did it?===

It is no coincidence that Farrah Fawcett and jacko died on the same day. Reports state that earlier that day, on her deathbed Farrah's last dying wish was for all the children in the world to be safe. So God smiled on Farrah and killed Michael Jackson. What's the difference between Farrah and Jacko? One screwed Majors, the other screwed minors....

===Doctor Did It===

It it now becoming apparent that his Doctor Conrad Murray is responsible for drugging Jacko to death as the Coroner has requested all his files as well as the LAPD, Los Angeles Country Sheriff, and now the DEA and FBI because this will not be the same without the [[Party Van]]. They all want to know how this Doctor got his hands on a IV administered drug that is only available at hospitals.

===Illuminati Did Michael Jackson===
The [[Illuminati]] was infuriated when they learnt that Michael Jackson was going to reveal the truth about the Illuminati's conspiracy to take over the world and reduce the world population by 90% in his next concert. They had their eyes on MJ every since he created this non-satanic song which has a somewhat empowering effect, which is exactly the opposite of what the Illuminati wants (since everyone in the music industry must submit to [[Satan]] in order to get anywhere).
<youtube>FAi3dJIJwgI</youtube>

===Jews Jealous of Allah did Michael Jackson ([[Copypasta]])===

Not surprisingly, this particular theory holds considerable sway in the [[Middle East]]. The synopsis goes as follows: MJ had converted to Islam in the Middle East and intended to do a final farewell concert, encouraging his fans to do the same. Jews got wind of his intentions, and since he did not pass through any long tunnels where they could [[accident]]ize him like Diana when she got pregnant with an Arab, they had to kill him by injection. Apparently, Jews wanted him to continue pushing Diet Pepsi to the Americunts, not [[Allah]]!

{{quote3|
Michael Jackson (MJ) was known as the most loving person in the world. He gave up most of his assets for charity and all his life, he fought for equality of the African Americans, AIDS victims, Against Drug Abuse, Against Abortion, Against Child Labor and secretly channelled his properties for the hungry children of the world. However, he wasn't peace at heart. He always think of himself as a child trapped inside a man's body. Being Peter Pan is all his dream, never to grow up, forever a child. That inspires him to build Neverland - a heaven for children. Children of all ages and races are welcomed to Neverland. MJ had so much love to give. 

However, he made a mistake which he didn't know of the consequences. He saw the peaceful life his brother, Jermaine (Muhammad Abdul Aziz) had as a Muslim - true, Jermaine faced so much pressure that he moved to Bahrain. 

In 1989, MJ made a press conference which shocked the world, "I have seen the Islam in the life of my brother, I have read the books about Islam. And I'd love to someday feel the calmness and peace of Islam...." 

Since that, MJ's life was never the same again. 
He was accused of so many accusations against child molestation. MJ was not someone who can deal with much pressure as he is a 'delicate child'. All the extortion and black mail followed after that. Everything he did was being seen as wrong in the eyes of the Media. All these are to influence his fans to hate MJ. If he is hated, then he would not be influencial anymore. 

For several years, he stayed in England. Getting motivation from a long time friend, Cat Stevens, who had converted into Islam - named Yusuf Islam. From him, MJ learnt how Yusuf had survived being Muslim. He made friends with a song writer, Zain Bhikha too, who wrote a song titled, "GIVE THANKS TO ALLAH", which he wanted MJ to sing whenever he is ready. 

Following his trial, MJ withdrew to Bahrain, where he was the special guest of sheik Abdullah bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the son of Bahrain's king. It was then that Michael began to give conversion more "serious thought." MJ stayed in Bahrain for approximately 3 years. He studied Islam, the prayers and learn to read the Quran. 

Finally, he came back to Los Angeles and in November 2008 MJ had formally converted to Islam in a ceremony at a close friend's house in Los Angeles. He perform Haj with the King of Bahrain and son on December 2008. 

He had a hidden agenda when he wanted to make a final comeback. He annouced in a press conference on March 2009, "This will be my final concert. I'll see you all in July...." 

He planned that during his concert, he would announce that this is the FINAL concert as he wouldn't be performing anymore. He will declare that he is a Muslim and will only sing with Yusuf Islam and Friends. 
At the end of the concert, he will be singing the song, "GIVE THANKS TO ALLAH" with Yusuf Islam. That is the reason why he chose London as his final concert venue instead of the USA. It was because he thought he could escape the USA's extortion, and that he could perform with yusuf Islam who is in England. 

At 12.30am, 25th June 2009, he hugged his production manager and said, "After reherasing for 2 months, I am finally ready for the concert..." Before leaving to sleep, he waved his dancers, "It was a good night everyone. I'll see you all tomorrow..." The next thing... He was pronouced dead at 2.26am..... 

When 911 was called, there are so much questions asked. It is as if they didn't know who MJ is and where he lived. The questions asked are more towards to delay time. The hospital said the autopsy result can only be obtained after 2 months - very illog ical as even the worst African technology could obtain the result in less than 2 weeks. 

MJ's family members opt for second private autopsy as they started to feel something fishy is going on. The result came out in about 4 days - MJ was drugged with high dosage of anaesthetic - drug that brings about a reversible loss of consciousness, if used to much could stop the heart from beating. 

Another result which was not aired in the media was, MJ's stomach is empty of this drug, but his blood were filled with it - same case as the death of Marilyn Monroe. The private doctors also found many needle marks, afraid to be forced injections given to MJ on his bed. 

In CNN Live after a week, Barack Obama was interviewed. And he said, "I love MJ, I grew up listening to his songs.. It is a great loss, but rest assured that there is no conspiracy in his death..." 
Now, why must a President made such statement before the official autopsy result came out? How would he know that there is no conspiracy without the post-mortem result? Seems like someone is afraid of his shadows.. 

MJ was known to the world as a person who is against drug abuse. Why must he be addicted to drug, then? If he wanted to commit suicide, why rehearse for his concert? And why will he want to see his dancers the next day? 

Enough about his death. I am sure people around the world is not stupid anymore. These supreme power can fool us during the Marilyn Monroe conspiracy, Martin Luther King and Princess Diana. But in this MJ's case, they left too many loopholes for those who think...!! 

MJ's family was about to give him a Muslim burial with the help of The Brotherhood of Islam. But, the CIA showed up at Neverland's door - blackmailed them that if they do so publicly, Katherine (MJ's mother) would be pull off from MJ's 3 children's custody as well as MJ's estates. Instead, they'll hire Debbie Rowe for the purpose, and the court will be in their favour. So much for democracy and fairness.... 

Finally, they agreed to let MJ have a Muslim Burial in Neverland. But in condition, must show to the public a Christian Memorial Service, as to prove to the world that MJ was never a Muslim. 

So, Staples Centre was just a normal show. That's why the coffin was closed and sealed. 

MJ was buried days earlier. The Gold Coffin was empty. They were about to bury the Coffin according to Christianity ways in Hollywood - as in their deal with the USA Government. 

These happened, because the USA is afraid of the rising numbers of Muslims in the world.

==Funeral==

[[Image:Paris-Michael-Katherine_Jackson_Memorial_OscarOscar.jpg|thumb|Paris Jackson, Michael Jackson's only daughter, accepts an Oscar for her stellar performance at the memorial ceremony.]]

[[Image:Jacklelz.jpg|thumb|LOL vandalism is pointless on this page or anywhere else on ED.]]

Jacko had a [[LOL|gala]] [[BAWWWW|public memorial service]] at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Jackson did not appear from the dead and deliver a true-to-life rendition of "Thriller", much to the chagrin of most of the audience. [[Paris_Hilton|Paris-Michael Katherine]] did, however, deliver a [[Lie|heart-felt]] speech at the end about how [[O RLY|great a father Jacko was]], and how they will lose their $1000/week allowances. It is not known who coached her into making said statements, as everyone knows Jackson's fatherhood suffered a brutal [[death]] after falling three stories off a balcony.

The hapless losers who invested $400 million for Jacko's comeback tour (who also own the Staples Center) gave out 11,000 free tickets to the public instead of selling them at a high markup. After burning $400 mil on a [[fail|now canceled due to death]] tour, why not just lose more money?

During the faggy memorial service, [[rape|Kobe Bryant]] and [[AIDS|Magic Johnson]] took the stage; the latter having appeared in the music video [[Shit nobody cares about|Remember the Time (I Raped You)]]. After everyone watching asked themselves "why the fuck are they there," Magic Johnson went on to recount a tender <s>crisp</s> moment he shared with Wacko Jacko:

'''LAWDY MICHAEL, IS DAT SUM [[Chikins|CHIKKINZ]]?'''
<youtube>-v-Y3ydRlGI</youtube>

During the service various speakers all lauded the strangeness that was Michael Jackson, spouting tall tales such as creditng Wacko Jacko with the election of [[Barack Obama]] as [[President]] (not that there aren't similarities).

It was reported that the Jacko family first opted for [[kill it with fire|cremation]], but it was discovered after years of plastic surgery and various chemical treatments to his skin that his body is now [[flame]] resistant. NASA has approached Joe Jacko in the hope of getting corpse samples to use in research on new heat shields for space vehicles.

It has been reported that Jacko has finally been buried at Forest Lawn Cemetary, instead of doing the right thing and donating his body to science fiction.

==Autopsy==

Initial autopsy results were inconclusive but reports from the Los Angeles Country Medical Examiner's office do showed that Jackson's body was 35% plastic and other recycled materials. After the rest of Jack's chassis had been released for embalming and burial subsequent autopsy and toxicology tests were done on Jackson's brain. On August 24th, 2009, the final results [http://www.wbaltv.com/entertainment/20535026/detail.html?treets=bal&tml=bal_natlbreak&ts=T&tmi=bal_natlbreak_1_02580108242009 were leaked] revealing the obvious: Jacko had died of a massive drug overdose and although he'd done the world a favour, Jacko's personal physician was accused of [[OJ Simpson|'''MURDER!!!''']] 

The doctor, cardiologist Conrad Murray, had been treating Jackson for insomnia for about six weeks with a buttload of the hospital-grade anaesthetic Diprovan every night via the tip of his penis. Murray said he feared Jackson was becoming addicted to the anesthetic, which is supposed to be used only in hospitals and other advanced medical settings, so he had lowered the dose and threw in the sedatives Valium and midazolam.

According to court records Murray said he resisted a tired Jacko's incessant whining for Diprovan (which he referred to as "his milk") fearful that the pop star had developed a dangerous addiction to the drug. Instead, Murray administered the sedatives Valium, lorazepam and midazolam five times over six hours but it didn't work and he continued to demand his "[[cum|milk]]". Jackson stopped breathing about 10 minutes after Dr Death relented and finally gave in to his patient's demands.

My pulse got flipped turned upside down,<br>
Now I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there,<br>
I'll tell you how I had cardiac arrest in Bel Air.<br>

In Gary, Indiana born and raised,<br>

Chillin' out, maxin', relaxing all cool,<br>
and sittin' in a van outside of a school<br>

When a couple of parents said I was up to no good,<br>
said I was molesting their kids in the neighborhood.<br>
I got in one little incident, and the police got scared<br>
and said "You movin' with your Blanket and children in Bel-Air"<br>

I said I'll do a big concert tour, and when it came near<br>
I needed a trainer - my body stress load was severe.<br>
One morning that I woke up and suddenly felt pain,<br>
I said "Nah forget it, YO HOLMES LET'S TRAIN!"<br>

The very next day, 'round 11 or 12,<br>
blood stopped rushing to my heart valve.<br>
I collapsed on the floor, and to rejoicing of haters<br>
I yelled to the world "yo holmes smell ya later"<br>

Slipped into a coma and I was finally there,<br>
dead of cardiac arrest at my home in Bel-Air.<br>

==Death: The Ultimate PR==

Before Jacko's death, no one gave a shit about him and his music.  Only because it isn't even good enought to suck monley balls.  To everyone, including his own family he was a [[Loser|washed-up pop star]], with plastic skin and a fake nose. LaToya (Michael's evil twin brother) publicly accused Jacko of being a pervert on Geraldo Rivera's talk show in the 1990's. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hypocrite Now he is an infallible pop music legend and his music is hotter than ever.] Use this to your advantage and [[profit|profit]] off his corpse while you still can!

==Now that he is Dead, let the whoring begin.==

With jacko dead, the rest of the jacksoff family is without their primary cash cow. Like Elvis before him, it is time to plaster his plastic surgery ravaged face on anything and everything.  First up are two video games, one the Michael Jackson Experience, a Wii dance game.

The most ambition project is Planet Michael, a HEUG MMO set within Michael Jackson's World based on his music videos and career. It is not known is players can enter the game as such characters as, Plastic Suregon, Private Doctor, Neverland Maid, Monkey Wrangler, Coffee Enema Administer, Anal Tampon Inserter, Personal Doctor Shopper and the best of all a 12 year old boy.

If this game becomes reality, there is much LULZ potential for griefing. The Patriotic Nigras will probably shut the servers down withing in 30 minutes of opening, which is a terrible, cruel, and IGNORANT thing to do.

===Fun things to do.===

*Go the Neverland as a 12 year old boy.

*Ask when bed time is, when the little had touches the big hand.

*Find Bubbles and give him a spanking.

*Close the pool because it has Aids.

*RAID Neverland, swarm the sim with characters all dressed as police, start asking where the CP is.

==An Hero, From Beyond the grave==

On November 5 2009, Evan Chandler, man who accused Michael Jackson of molesting his child Jordy, was left saddened as he did not steal as much money from Jackson as wanted to. So, he [[an hero]]'d. And made little to any notable headlines. Unsuccessful troll was unsuccessful.
