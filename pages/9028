WikiProject
A '''WikiProject''' is something created by fanatical [[TOW]] editors who wish to focus their energy on [[article]]s in a particular [[Armenia|subject area]]. Because Wikipedia has [[Bureaucratic Fuck|so many rules]], they feel the need to organize and categories everything and grade articles as an "[[A+|A]]", "[[B]]", "[[good article|GA]]" or "[[featured article|FA]]" to the extent that it is... "[[asspie|just so]]"; [[radiohead|everything is in its right place]]. This is most evident on [[talk page]]s, where the discussion page is cluttered with huge banners that serve no real fucking purpose other than to confuse [[n00b]]s who are already being kept a watchful eye on by the [[admin]]s who take out their sexual frustration by blocking new users for making the slightest mistake.

==Types of WikiProjects==

There are many types of WikiProject. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Alternative_music Alternative rock music] WikiProject is highly successful, due to the fact that many [[Wikipedos]] are bored [[college]] students with too much time on their hands, which means that after getting their daily fix of [[Pitchfork Media]], they have the time to write a [[featured article]] or [[good article]] about the latest [[shit bands|A Silver Mount Zion]] album that they bought for $21.99, which is a fair price to pay because [[Canadian]] [[Jewish]] post-rock labels don't fund weapons manufacturing like albums by bands on major labels in which [[Rupert Murdoch]] has a stake. However, since Wikipedia is like [[Scientology]], they're still making money for [[Jimbo Wales|The Man]], who generates revenue from these asspies' hard work by reselling his open content to commercial sites so that he can exploit [[hooker]]s in any city he travels to for the next [[Wikimania]], and thus Jimbo will be experiencing his first taste of [[Arab]] pussy at Wikimania Egypt 2008.

Many WikiProjects are so small and insignificant that they are not deemed to be WikiProjects at all. Instead, they are called "taskforces". For example, [[Albania]] only has a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Europe/Albania taskforce], whilst such important subjects as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_SpongeBob_SquarePants SpongeBob SquarePants], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_My_Chemical_Romance My Chemical Romance] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Tenacious_D Tenacious D] have got their own WikiProjects, [[obviously]]. This is because of [[the Wikipedia Jews]], who deny Albania a full WikiProject as they [[do not want]] to see a [[European]] country with such a high proportion of [[Muslim]]s to get full representation on Wikipedia, in accordance with their understanding of [[NPOV]]. Latest reports suggest that they are considering cutting back the expenses on having a WikiProject on [[Sweden]] for the same reasons.

There is also a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PAW Pedophilia Article Watch] WikiProject, which is maintained by the user SqueakBox, a middle-aged [[British]] emigrant living in Nicaragua with his [[black|Latina]] wife and two [[dog]]s, and his companion [[Erik MÃ¶ller]], who is a huge fan of the project and its capacity to lure young editors to Wikipedia.
