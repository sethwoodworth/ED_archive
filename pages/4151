It was a social experiment
{{finalsolutions}}
The term '''social experiment''' are the two magic words that make everything better on the [[internet]]. Whether it is a slip of the keyboard, failed [[troll]], or just plain [[Attention whore|desperate for attention]], typing out ''it was just a social experiment'' will makes things all better. Great for curing [[troll's remorse]].

===Examples===

*[[90 Day Jane|I am going to kill myself in 90 days. What else should i say? This blog is not a cry for help or even to get attention]]
*[[City glitter|Guiz,I didn't really set my pussy on fire. Srry for taking ur money. I'll just ''donate'' it to some shelter. It was just an experiment ^_^]] 
*<strike>[http://www.savetoby.com Gimme money or I eat the rabbit]</strike> Overtaken by capitalists
*[[Operation Falcon Punch|It wasn't an elaborate troll, a psycopathic attempt to kill participants, nor was it a quest to find a bad of shit. 905 was a test of MY mind. A test of my ability to plan, improvise, and execute. A test of my sanity. And I failed that test.]]
*[[The Joker| And here we... go.]]
*[http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/07/loyola_university_professor_be.html It was a real social experiment], [[Lies|for serious academic purposes]].
