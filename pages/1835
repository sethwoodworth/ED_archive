<big>'''''[[dumbass|A creationist]]'''''</big> is someone that maintains that 150 years of consistent, peer reviewed, tested and retested scientific data produced by thousands of people who spent much more than $1200 and 2 months of "studying" to get a PhD are all wrong and that [[Earth]] and life were not created by a slow but observable process over millions of years but by an infinitely knowing, loving, and powerful, yet seemingly [[Fagnostic|indecisive]] and [[Truth|possibly bipolar]] deity in less than a week.

Generally, creationists will argue that [[Ad hominem|evolution (and pretty much everything else that people didn't pull out of their asses and called "scripture" at least 100 years ago) is false]], because it [[Lie|hasn't been proven]] and because everything could not have spawned from nothing. Therefore "[[Bullshit|creationism is correct]]", because it makes far more sense that an [[God|omnipotent super human]] created everything from nothing [[Over 9000|6000]] years ago by [[Do they speak english in what|talking]], and everything was already finished in that instant, including life, and this is all proven true because it was in a book written by people who were raving mad from [[AIDS|epidemics]] and [[drugs|wigging out on spoiled grain]]. Evolution is well acknowledged as a scientific fact, even by most [[christfag]]s. Creationists, however, would [[tubgirl|bathe in their own shit]] if the Bible or Kent Hovind told them to do so.

One of the many repercussions of being of this brand of [[Christfag]] is  that your career choices are limited to either harassing customers about Jesus at the grocery store you push carts at or conning people out of their money by completely making shit up and calling yourself a scientist until eventually getting [[Partyvan|partyvanned]] for [[VenomfangX|fraud]].

==[[Oxymoron|Creationist Education]]==
===Here is the 'How Do You Know if you are a Creatard?' Test:===
# ''Are [[science]], [[logic]], [[Fact|observable data]], and [[Intelligence|rationality]] completely and utterly incorrect?''
# ''Is [[God]] correct?''
# ''Do I have a Doctorate from an [[Truth|unaccredited]], Christian diploma-mill?''
# ''Am I from the [[Conservative|South]]?''
# ''[[Am i rite]]?''

If you answered 'Yes' to ''any'' of the above, you are a Creatard. Well done! [[Scientology|Buy shares in tinfoil hats]].
===Unintelligent Design===
Some creationists call themselves "proponents of intelligent design" and pretend to understand science.  Here is your test!:

# ''Was the world created 6,000 years ago?''
# ''Do you quote-mine to support your position?''
# ''Can you prove this assertion using carbon-dating and the fossil record?''

If you answered 'Yes' to any of the above, you are either [[VenomfangX|lying]] or painfully, and willfully, ignorant.  Modern science has obviously been [[pwnt]] by cave-dwelling sheep-fuckers from [[at least 100]] years ago, and you're going to prove it by [[lying|using modern science]]!

* All [[dinosaurs]] were [[vegetarians]].
* It's okay to [[incest|fuck your parents]] because the Bible says so in Genesis 19:30-38
* Evolution is wrong because monkeys don't give birth to human beings and because there's no such thing as a [[Crocoduck]].

* Evidence is for [[fags]].
* [[God hates fags]].
* HIV doesn't cause [[AIDS]].

==Strategies And Scare Tactics==

==Spot the Troll==
As creationists come up with (and believe) the most ridiculous arguments it's not always easy to tell whether they actually believe such bullshit or whether they are trolls in disguis. [[You]] be the judge.

===Satan Invented Evolution!=== 

[[Image:Twintowerbigbang.png|thumb|left|science I has it!]]
The reason why evolution exists, according to this [[Fail|intellectual genius]] named [[VenomFangX]] (more like Venom'''[[Truth|FAG]]'''X, [[amirite]]?), is not because [[smart|some old guy thought it up]]. No, it was Satan!! Satan started evolution in the Garden of Eden, who told Eve everything in order to further his plans for world domination. Also, [[fucktard|VenomFangX]] states that scientists just merely thought up the idea from their imagination that all Hu-Mans are related to either dogs or [[cock|bananaz]], or sporks, and that [[lies|we are all idiots for reading books.]]  Though Creationists, such as VenomFailX, fail to realize that this argument is flawed, since [[furry|furries]] exist.

==Videos==

Creationists are completely incapable of handling rejection and critique of their ideas. As such, they are virulent proponents of [[censorship]]. This ranges from [[Banhammer|banhammering]] to filing false [[DMCA]] claims in order to "do it for [[jebus]]"

[[VenomfangX|VenomfagX]], a well-known creatard who has used such strategy against thunderf00t. Another more recent strategy is to now use votebots, which votes down a [[youtube]] video. This tactic of course sparked some outrage and [[Pwnt|backfired]], causing more people to be aware of their dirty tricks than before. 

So in conclusion, creationist tactics usually end up with a lot of [[fail]]. Let's recap;<br>

<big>'''Video gets voted down using votebots'''</big>
# Video is viewed less
# They have less chance of being seen as wrong.
[[Christfags]] think it stops here...

<big>'''The next steps are...'''</big>
# People hear about the votebots
# People ALL react with anger and vote videos back up
# The message is spread to MANY more people than it would have reached.
# The tactic backfires and they are even worse off than if they hadn't been a jackass.

==Famous Creationists==

*"Dr." Kent Hovnid - Famous for his Creationist Museum/giftshop/tax fraud scam showing humans living with dinosaurs. Earned his MA and Phd from Patriot Bible University, a prestigious educational institution held in some guy's split level house in Denver, which moved to a much bigger [[trailer park|prefab]] house in 1997. He was later V& by the IRS for tax fraud and is now doing 30 years in a federal prison, because he felt he is too jesusy to be held liable to Federal, State and Local laws. 

*"Dr." Carl Baugh - Another creationist with questionable education credentials, who always appears when the were some creationist vs evolution controversy in the USA. He always appears with some "evidence" proving his claims but when the PROOF is always exposed as a fraud under real scientific tests. Just like Hovnid even creationist orgs such as Answers in Genesis, are critical of him just because his antics make their views look as respectable as [[Time Cube]].
 
*Dr. Pepper - While not a creationist, this soft drink made from 64 flavors is still more of a Doctor than any of these fools.
