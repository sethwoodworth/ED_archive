Hivemind
[[Image:Hivemind_logo.jpg|thumb|250px|International symbol for Hivemind]]
'''Hivemind''' (or '''collective consciousness''') is [[shit nobody cares about|the belief that the values or opinions]] of the group (or "hive") are [[over 9000|greater than]] the values or opinions of the [[you|individual]].  It's the bane of all rational thought, and ensures that since discourse will be avoided, actual progress is also avoided.  Found in the cesspools of [[TOW]].

Unfortunately for the internet, /v/ has been angling towards this ideal, trying to achieve a single hivemind of perfection. Most times a hivemind is achieved, it starts as something completely random posted by 2 users in succession. This is usually followed [[at least 100|by hundreds]] of wannabe hivemind members joining in, quoting HIVEMIND over and over, as if it wouldn't be obvious that would happen. Unknown to /v/, [[B|/b/]] achieved hivemind status years before them, learning to simultaneously [[circle jerk|jack off together]] in perfect harmony.
