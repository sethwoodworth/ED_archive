'''BBS''' (Short for '''Bulletin Board System''', was the primitive forerunner to the [[Web 2.0|modern]] [[4chan|thread-based forum]]. Oldfags used BBS to to play [[LORD]], Tradewars 2002, and download [[warez|pirated software]] and [[porn]] before broadband. [[Noone]] uses them anymore, because they are so [[Web 1.0]].

BBS's [[Bullshit|were invented by]] [[Kimmo Alm]], and all others are actually [[illegal clone|illegal clones]].
