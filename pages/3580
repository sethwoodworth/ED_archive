Haiku
{{quote|A haiku is just like a normal American poem except it doesn't rhyme and it's totally stupid.|[[south park|Mr Garrison]]}}

'''Haiku''' (俳句) is a fucking [[stupid]] form of [[Japanese]], consisting of 17 moras, in three phrases of 5, 7, and 5 moras respectively. In Japanese, every letter of the alphabet is a single syllable, hence the emergence of syllable-play as an art form. This means that the only reason to ever, ever, ever, EVER write a haiku in English is as a desperate attempt to be arty and [[Wapanese]] inbetween cursing the roundness of your eyes and shoving [[Pocky]] down your urethra.

Examples below:
 I hate you fuckers.
 Why so angry? Cause I am.
 I fuckin' you guys.

 Sick on a journey 
 Over parched fields 
 Dreams wander on.

 Lightening
 Heron's cry 
 Stabs the darkness

 Dead bitches don't scream.
 A cold tight cunt makes me hot.
 [[Necrophilia|Mortician school rocks!]]

Don't count the syllables, you [[fucktard]], they are translated.

And now the [[original]]:

 ですですで
 ですですですで
 ですですで

(Translation)
 Desu desu de
 Desu desu desu de
 desu desu de.
