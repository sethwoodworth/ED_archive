'''Numa numa''', also known as the Numa numa guy, is the very definition of [[old meme]] that just won't die. A video of an [[fat|overweight]] 19 year old [[New Jersey]] [[teenager]] (named Gary Brolsma, who will never, ever get laid) singing and dancing along to a [[Romania]]n pop song attempting to outshine the [[Star Wars Kid]] and make a gayer video than the original artists. Passed around the [[internets]] like so much [[Paris Hilton]] [[porn]], this perplexing video leaves you wondering "why did this kid do this?" but instead "[[unfunny|why do other people think this is funny?]]" The [[FBI]] almost closed the [[internets]] to remove all copies of the video when it was first thought that Gary was [[ginger]].

PROTIP: This [[bullshit|video]] is [[unfunny]].

Since it's [[inception]], many people have [[fail|attempted]] to make their own Numa Numa videos much to the horror of millions.

Obviously thinks that he is [[unwarranted self-importance|kind of a big deal]]. It should be noted that while the original "numa" song, "Dragostea Din Tae," was made by the Moldovian pop group O-Zone, the "New Numa" song didn't even have their involvement. This proves what a stupid fucking whore Broselman is: in order to continue milking shitty TV appearances from his original [[unfunny]] bullshit, he actually had a whole new song made ''just for him'', even though the whole point of the original Gary Broselman video- if there even was a point -was that he was dancing to someone else's song while making puns on foreign lyrics.

==Remake==
In September of 2006, Gary Brolsma realized he could become a [[winrar|chick magnet]] by exploiting his [[e-fame]]. He created a new, more professional video, with his own band and much more advanced [[flash]] files. The video was a flop, and he was revealed to be the faggot he was to the world. 

Sadly, he still goes at it with a third video and a site.

*[http://www.greatestshits.com Top 10 Greatest Shits] The guy seems to be just the 3rd lamest meme on teh internets
*[http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/numa.php Original video] of guy from New Jersey. Not the best quality or sound, but gives insight into how lame people are.
*<s>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0 some old memes don't want to die] because having one video isn't enough, he just decided to do another video with another song. Now with effects and background.</s> Seems like it DID die
*[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6987134 MSNBC report] which talks about how the video actually IS funny, proving once again that both [[Microsoft]] and [[NBC]] will always know exactly the opposite of cool.
*<s>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0 Actual Romanian video]</s>-[This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Viacom], wtf? 
*<s>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9MzKJak_ZQ Video] of the band O-Zone singing the original Dragostea din Tei. Watching the real video followed by the Jersey video illustrates exactly why Romania has cool pop culture but is also always trying to take down [[IRC]]. The original video is worth watching, though it should be noted it could not get any [[gay]]er if you shoved an elephant's schlong up its ass.  The song is really a gay love song but most people are too fucking stupid to realize that guys kissing, wearing rainbow colors, and dancing [[gay]] means that they're really gay.  The Jersey guy is a waste of time.</s>  Also copyright buttfucked.
*<s>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0 typical ripoff]</s> Does ripoff mean "doesn't work" in Romanian? NOTE: Yes, yes it does.
