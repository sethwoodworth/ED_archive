'''[http://kittenwar.com/ Kittenwar]''' is a website that places kittens in an arena where the [[terrorist]]s must fight the [[USA|Americans]] in the ultimate [[Dungeons and Dragons|battle]] of [[Kawaii|cuteness]]. It's sort of like a cross between [[Counterstrike]] and a [[Necrofurs|Necrofur]]'s wetdream.

== How it works ==
Visitors can [[Special:upload|upload]] pictures of their [[cat]]s. Then whenever anyone goes to the [[Main Page|main page]] of Kittenwar, they have to choose which one of the random kittens is cuter. The kittens are then sorted into [[winnar]]s [http://kittenwar.com/kittens/winners/] and [[luser]]s [http://kittenwar.com/kittens/losers/]. Best of all, it uses [[Dreamhost]] [http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?sherrod] just like [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]!

== Kittenwar on LiveJournal ==
Kittenwar is [[Eye bleach|a good website to look at to soothe your eyes]] after [[goatse]] or the [[pain series]].  Links to this website can be used to fill in [[virgin|unused]] [[bandwidth]] on [[furry|obsessively cat loving]] [[communities]]. [http://community.livejournal.com/kitty_luff_only/13532.html]
