Liberal (community)
[[Image:absolve.jpg|thumb|Killing two birds with one stone, liberals begin holding their protests in unempoyment lines. ]]
A community on [[lj]] populated with [[hippies]], [[communist]]s, and terrorist sympathizers currently lorded over by {{lj|user=marxist_thug}}.  It is one of the largest [[communities]] on [[lj]] adding truth to the old adage that [[idiots]] travel in packs.  They blame [[George W Bush]] for everything from [[global warming]] to the cancelation of [[WTC|twin peaks]]. It is a community that champions freedom of speech and they are willing to [[ban]] you to prove it.

When confronted with opposing thought they [http://www.livejournal.com/community/liberal/2107135.html ban the person], then they fire all the [[moderator]]s for letting people voice their opinions about banning the person. Finally, they make speaking the name of the banned person [http://www.livejournal.com/community/liberal/2109571.html a bannable offense].

The community is a breeding ground for [[conservative]] [[trolls]] who believe that it is easy to exploit self loathing [[liberal arts student]]s lamenting that the [[porn|women's studies]] job market is drying up.

==Non LiveJournal Liberals==

These are Americans who wish to hug [[Osama]] that either have not discovered [[lj]] or chose to espouse their faith on [[blogs]].  This allows them to feel [[elite]] while [[pimp]]ing their [[Amazon]] wish-lists and [[Google]] ads.

==Why do liberals hate America?==
''Why do liberals hate America?'' is a question so common that it has evolved into a [[catchphrase]].  Ever since 9/11, however, it has become [[common knowledge]] that liberals hate America because they are pussies.

Liberals believed that the American Hippie Movement in the 1960's had changed people for the better and everyone had a new respect and understanding for one another. In the mean time all the other countries in the world being pissed off for being used as pawns during the Cold War (see [[Afghanistan]]) and were tired of seeing their role models depicted as the bad guys in movies and [[Counter-Strike]]. Things in those countries were fucked up before [[George W. Bush]] was elected to office, but nobody cared because it was not shown on television. Now because [[MySpace]] says so, liberals somehow think that everything America does is wrong.
