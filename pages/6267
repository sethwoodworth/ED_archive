[[Image:Pareto.gif|right|frame|Maximize your trolling by applying the 80/20 rule.]] 

[[At least 100 years ago]], [[Italian]] Vilfredo Pareto built on [[economic]] [[statistics]] to propose the following principle: ''that 80% of [[lulz]] are generated by only 20% of the internet.'' This is known as '''Pareto's Principle'''. 

By focusing your trolling efforts on the vital few rather than the trivial many, your [[drama]] [[Profit|revenues]] will increase. Don't just troll hard, troll smart; troll the right [[lol-cow]]s.


== Some of the Vital Few  ==
* [[Duke Otterland]]
* [[Chibiabos]]
* [[Blackwingdragon]]
* [[Wolfjlupus]]
