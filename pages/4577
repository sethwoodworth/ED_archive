'''Robert James Ritchie''', known by his stage name '''Kid Rock''', aka [[STD|"HIV Cock"]], aka "Bob the Builder", is an [[USA|Americunt]] [[douchebag|rapper]] with [[AIDS|no talent]].  [[Redneck|Kid Rock]] is known for his [[faggotry|eccentric personality]] and his music that fuses [[shit|rap]] with heavy metal, [[KKK|southern rock]], funk and country music into an unlistenable mess.  Kid Rock [[shit nobody cares about|released several studio albums that mostly went unnoticed]] before his 1998 record ''Devil Without a Cock'', sold over 9000 albums behind the hits, "[[Nonsense|Bawitdaba]]","Cowboy," and "Only God Knows Why People Buy This Shit". As the undisputed number 1 embarrassment to [[White|white people]], he should [[Anonymous|never be forgiven]]. 
==Early years==
Kid Rock [[Fact|grew up on an apple orchard]], in Romeo, Michigan and his father was a wealthy car dealer - very gangsta. His parents would entertain guests with [[Satanic_Ritual_Abuse|Bobby singing covers of Jim Croce, Johnny Cash, John Denver and Bob Seger at their barn parties.]] 
==Albombs==
In 2000, he released ''The History of Cock'' which was a compilation of remixed and remastered versions of shit songs from his previous shit albums as well as the single, "American Boy Ass".  In 2001, he released the follow up, ''[[Cock|Cocky]]''. After a slow start, his country-flavored hit "Picture" with [[Cancer|Sheryl Crow]] resurrected the album and it went gold as a single and was followed by 2003's self-titled release, which [[LOL|failed to chart a major hit]]. In 2006 he released ''Live Trucker'', a live album that no one gave a fuck about, wherein he sucked off truckers and recorded the gobbling noises.
===Ruining Real Music===
In 2003, Kid Rock returned with a [[Copypasta|cover]] of Bad Company's "Feel Like Makin' Love.
He also ruined "Sad But True" by sampling it into "American Boy Ass".  He would induct Lynyrd Skynyrd into the 2006 Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame and vomit [[white_trash|"Sweet Home Alabama"]] with them.  "All Summer Long" is a hellish abortion that would bring Kid Rock back to the [[Radio|forefront of music]] during 2008 and 2009. It utilized the mash up of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama" and Warren Zevon's "Werewolves of London", while talking about two men falling in love during summer camp in 1989. In early 2001, Rock inducted Aerosmith into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and performed "Sweet Emotion" at the induction ceremony.
===Working Up A New Pile of Shit ===
Kid Rock's follow up to Rock N Roll Jesus is being produced by Jew. According to his official website, confirmed songs from the album include Mountain Song which is an Alabama cover (ZOMG A COVER?!), a mash up of Cowboy and Wanted Dead Or Alive featuring Bon Jovi, and a song which will sample Michael Jackson's Billie Jean.  All very original.

==Feuds==
===Tommy Lee===
In 2001 Kid Rock began dating [[whore|Playboy playmate]] and actress Pamela Anderson, after the two met at a [[HIV|VH1]] tribute to [[fat|Aretha Franklin]].  Tommy Lee, Anderson's ex-husband, was serving a jail sentence for spousal abuse of Anderson at the time. Kid Rock telephoned Lee to tell him he was dating Anderson. For a few years Tommy Lee threatened to "beat Kid Rock up" if they ever met in person. 
In 2004, while Kid Rock, Anderson, and Lee were coincidentally staying at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, Kid Rock learned that Anderson had contracted Hepatitis C from Lee. [[LOL WUT|He went through the hotel looking for Lee but a confrontation was avoided when Kid Rock barged into the wrong room.]]  After Kid Rock and Pamela Anderson were divorced in 2006, she resumed her relationship with Lee, briefly. Tommy Lee began sending text messages to Kid Rock, bragging that he and Anderson were back together and that he never satisfied her. 
{{quote|Her Hep-C is all mine now, bitch!|Tommy Lee text message}}
tl;dr [[White trash]] fight over [[whore]]. <br><br>At the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, Kid Rock went to the bathroom, and when he returned Tommy Lee had taken his seat to talk to black person. Kid Rock returned to his seat, and finding Lee there slapped and punched him before they were separated by security personnel. Kid Rock was later quoted as saying that he was "tired of the disrespect" from Tommy Lee.

====Waffle House scuffle====
In October 2007, Kid Rock was involved in a brawl at a Waffle House (yes, that's the name, and no, you wouldn't eat there) in Atlanta (yes, it's in Georgia, and no, you wouldn't visit) and [http://voanews.com/english/archive/2007-10/2007-10-22-voa26.cfm charged] with [http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/22/kid.rock.ap/index.html simple battery].

====Student Newspaper====
{{quote|Who does this [redacted] think he is??? Kid Rock’s album is unoriginal and not worth buying. Please tell me then who is original nowadays and who’s album is better today? I can’t name one. Kid Rock is influenced by Southern Rock and by Bob Seger, who is a Detroit native. The album surly shows his influences and is perfect. Would you say that about the Rolling Stones back in the sixties when they covered songs by Chuck Berry or Muddy Waters?
Maybe this [redacted] should go take a listen to Kid Rock’s albums before he made it big with Devil Without a Cause, in his earlier stuff he did the same thing that he did on this album, he talked about Hank Williams, Jr., John
Paul Jones and used an Ozzy Osbourne riff..exactly what he did on this album but with other influences. This [redacted] obviously does not know what or who he is talking about. He is probably one of them that only likes albums that are made popular by teenagers such as Britney Spears, Madonna, NSYNC, etc. I feel sorry for [redacted] that he can’t respect someone that makes*genuine***music of all genres. Kid Rock was 27 when Devil Without A Cause broke, he is around 36 now and I am sure he wants to make and perform music until he is 60 years old and he doesn’t want to be jumping around the stage at 60, sreaming.he is maturing and I am sorry that this [redacted] cannot see that
and does not respect that. I have wasted enough time on [redacted], he is nothing.and nothing compared to Kid Rock and [redacted] never will be!|Rob, totally PWNing [redacted]}}

====[[Retard|Ashley Simpson]]====
On May 27 Kid Rock would ruin 15 minutes of ''Saturday Night Live''. [[Pedophile|He did "American Boy Ass"]] and used the intro to trash the previous week's singer Ashley Simpson for lip syncing.  The second song was an acoustic version of "Only God Knows Why" that featured Phish's Trey Anatasio. Kid Rock would join Phish later in the year in Las Vegas, Nevada for a set of cover songs (COVER SONGS?!), making dirty [[hippy|hippies]] and dirtier [[white trash]] everywhere coalesce in an epic orgy of bad taste and melanin [[fail]].

====Insane Clown Posse====
In 1992 Kid Rock recorded the track "Is That You?" with the [[juggalo|Insane Clown Posse]] on their 1992 album ''Carnival of Carnage''. A payment altercation would lead to an ICP/Kid Rock feud for several years.  Kid Rock showed up to record "Is That You?" intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day. ICP would during an interview about the album diss Kid Rock and said they didn't even want him on the album. Kid Rock responded on his bootleg series tapes on "Ya Keep On" saying {{quote|Don't call me Joe, cause the Joes I know can't even flow.|Kid Rock, showing off his skills}} Two homosexual clowns would respond with "Posse On Vernor" with {{quote|Junkie on the corner, needle about to shoot, with a rebel flag and some cowboy boots, the closer we got the more clear it became, it's Kid Rock yelling What's my name?}} Kid Rock hasn't responded as he is a massive pussy who can't even [[PWN]] a [[juggalo]], not that it matters, juggalos are too stupid to realize they've been pwnd and Kid Rock sucks, or have I said that already?

==Ruining Women==
===Pam Anderson===
By April 2002, he and Anderson were engaged, but the engagement was later called off.  Kid Rock and Pamela Anderson resumed their on-again, off-again relationship, culminating in a surprise wedding in July 2006 after it was reported Anderson was pregnant. They divorced 5 months later after Kid Rock stated she [[LOL WUT|lied about having a miscarriage]].

===Sheryl Crow===
[[Image:Sheryl_Crow_Stuff.jpg|thumb|100px|She was hot, before Rock.]]Together, they released "Picture", a country-influenced duet which introduced Kid Rock to a [[white trash|wider audience]].  "Picture" was ultimately the most successful single on the album, and the song remains his most successful pop song in the US to date.  After accepting his disease-ridden penis, Sheryl was forced to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Crow#Personal_life seek medical attention].
