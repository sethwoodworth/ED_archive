'''Game Boy Advance''' (GBA) is a portable game player released by [[Nintendo]] in 2001. It is a device used by [[13 year old boys]] to play ''[[Pokémon]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]''-related software, ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh]]'', and remakes of old Super Nintendo games.

== Design ==

Game Boy Advance comes in three flavors: SP, Micro, and Horseradish. All three taste like ham. 

The original GBA was as big as a spaceship and made your hands feel like they were being cut with knives. Quick to recognize these flaws, Nintendo soon followed it with "GBA SP", which is the model recommended by most physicians.

Another version, the "[[shit|Game Boy Micro]]", was released in 2005. It is a tiny, remodeled GBA designed for single-celled organisms and certain types of [[midget|microscopic algae]].

== Graphics ==
Game Boy Advance has [[l33t]] 2D graphics capabilities. It also has limited 3D abilities which are quite [[Epilepsy|dangerous]] when put into motion. 

'''[[PROTIP]]:''' Place your Game Boy Advance in direct sunlight to get an idea of what the hell is going on.

== Games ==
There are plenty of Game Boy Advance games out there, if you're willing to look. The best places to find them are in the bedrooms of neighborhood children, inside your best friend's bookbag, and if you don't have a crowbar or a friend, massive bins in any department store, where they try to get people to buy shitty GBA games for $10 each. 

Game developers, primarily Nintendo, used the Game Boy Advance as an excuse to remake old games for years before they started getting ideas. Thus, the Game Boy Advance was rendered worthless by the release of the Wii's virtual console. But you could play them at school at least.

Some more noteworthy games include:
*''Pong''
*''Boogerman: A Pick and Flick Adventure''

== Game Boy Advance Video ==

Later in the run of the Game Boy Advance, videos containing children's TV Shows such as ''Pokemon'', ''[[Fairly Oddparents]]'', ''Sonic X'', and ''Ultimate Muscle'' were released in Game Boy Advance format. The quality was lower than running a YouTube Video in full-screen mode, and a reminder to why the "Full Motion Video" genre vanished in the 90's. 

Because of [[copyright]] faggotry, these Gameboy Advance video cartridges were not playable on the GBA player for the Gamecube.

== Criticisms ==
* Game Boy never comes with enough Pr0n
* Its radioactive properties kill anything it comes into contact with 
* Difficult to play underwater
