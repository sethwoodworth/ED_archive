[21:28] <%generationslayer> basicly, it was over a gift
[21:28] <@weev> who was arguing?
[21:28] <@dlb> sheneequa: the peanut gallery can watch, don't be a kike
[21:28] <@weev> what was the gift?
[21:28] <%generationslayer> given to me
[21:28] <%generationslayer> me and shadowkyogre
[21:28] <%generationslayer> hence that argument you see in the artical

[21:28] <%generationslayer> ok
[21:28] <@weev> if you can't be bothered to tell me
[21:28] <@weev> i can't help you
[21:29] <%generationslayer> it was just a simple argumet
[21:29] <%generationslayer> in the work, she kicks my main charaters ass
[21:29] <%generationslayer> and i was fine with that
[21:29] <@dlb> is this some fanfic/RPG stuff then?
[21:29] <%generationslayer> but, down in the artist comment, she said she hated my main charater with her guts
[21:30] <%generationslayer> some what
[21:30] <%generationslayer> i am a writer
[21:30] <%generationslayer> a vore writer
[21:30] <%generationslayer> but i only do clean non porn stuff
[21:30] <@weev> you don't think the very act of vorephilia is pornographic
[21:30] <@weev> in itself?
[21:31] <%generationslayer> in a way
�03[21:31] * LYNX is now known as LYNX_voice_plz
[21:31] <@dlb> weev: agree, this is confusing to me as well
[21:31] <%generationslayer> but to degree
�03[21:31] * weev sets mode: +v LYNX_voice_plz
[21:31] <%generationslayer> i don't show tits
[21:31] <@weev> do you have a reason for disrupting the court?
�03[21:31] * LYNX_voice_plz is now known as LYNX
[21:31] <@weev> LYNX: ?
[21:31] <%generationslayer> and cocks
[21:31] <%generationslayer> and all that stuff

�03[21:31] * weev sets mode: +v manglik
[21:31] <@weev> manglik: your question?
[21:32] <%generationslayer> here, this is where you can see how the artical was created
[21:32] <+manglik> generationslayer: You have lots of spelling mistakes, are your parents also immigrants
 like mine?
[21:32] <%generationslayer> http://twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=7723
[21:32] <+manglik> I find it hard to correctly spell since English is not my first language. I was wondering 
if it wsa the same with you.
[21:32] <%generationslayer> i ment to say that sooner, i am a horrible speller

[21:33] <+OSS-voice-plz> The original post, as you see now, doesn't resemble how it was when it was posted.
 It would be helpful for those of you who are judging this to be aware of the original content of the post.
[21:34] <%generationslayer> if you look deeper in
[21:34] <@weev> generationslayer: do you have a picture of yourself?
[21:34] <+OSS-voice-plz> In that original post, yes, I did deeply despise Loreit
[21:34] <@weev> i like to evaluate people's requests
[21:34] <@weev> based on how friendly and trustworthy their face looks
[21:34] <%generationslayer> it says "Okay, i just posted the ed artical"
[21:34] <+Thayo> Yes
[21:34] <+Thayo> It was just an update
[21:35] <%generationslayer> but she was also the creator
[21:35] <+OSS-voice-plz> but the main reason was, as the article clearly implies, that I hated Loreit
 because so much of her character did not make sense to me at the time
[21:35] <+OSS-voice-plz> that was the original content
[21:35] <+OSS-voice-plz> of the post
[21:35] <%generationslayer> yes
[21:35] <@weev> okay
[21:35] <+OSS-voice-plz> along with links to the story and the journal associated with it
�03[21:35] * weev sets mode: -v OSS-voice-plz
[21:35] <@weev> generationslayer: the court is formally requesting photographs of you

[21:35] <+Thayo> Yes
[21:35] <%generationslayer> ummm
[21:35] <+Thayo> I warned you about this earlier
[21:35] <%generationslayer> must i?
[21:35] <@weev> i would advise you to cooperate
[21:36] <@weev> with this courtroom
[21:36] <@weev> else i'll hold you in contempt

[21:41] <PerpA> Hey generationslayer: draw us a self portrait then
[21:41] <Lusit> oh, okay
[21:41] <@dlb> it's that simple
[21:41] <Habermann> When you ingest someone, wouldn't they burn from the stomach acid?
[21:41] <%generationslayer> don't draw
�01[21:41] <TrainOfThought> generationslayer: How did you upload your deviant art photos if you do not have

[21:42] <Mikal> Q: How do you know you're into Vorephilia? Surely the downside to having a fetish for being
 eaten is you can only try it the once? How do you test the waters, so to speak?
�01[21:42] <TrainOfThought> EDS1 is right
[21:42] <Jules> Being on CP time isn't beneficial in arbchat.
[21:42] <Thayo> Yes
�01[21:42] <TrainOfThought> We gave you 90 minutes generationslayer
[21:42] <toastmonster> i agree with EDS1
[21:42] <Thayo> I told you
�01[21:42] <TrainOfThought> during that time

 off while singing the Nazi national anthem
[21:42] <Thayo> 9PM
�01[21:42] <TrainOfThought> I had a panic attack

[21:42] <EDS1> how rude that was?
[21:42] <Thayo> You came an hour late
[21:42] <@dlb> we're going to dox you
�01[21:42] <TrainOfThought> I could sue you in a court of lawl
[21:42] <toastmonster> more than that man
[21:42] <Joey> I'd say post a picture.

[21:43] <%generationslayer> no its not
[21:43] <EDS1> Pictures of yourself would clearly be a good way to ... clear up this little late incident.
 dont you think everyone?

[21:44] <kale_> i will make you life a living hell
[21:44] <Mikal> There's no real 'clearup' required, EDS1... The important thing is making sure he doesn't
 look like a kike, and thus appear untrustworthy.

[21:44] <Jules> We know.
[21:44] <Jules> We can tell.
[21:44] <kale_> if you dont give pics

court, and the honorable andrew weevlos, but all of ED and it's userbase?
[21:45] <Anitude> EDS1 is right
[21:45] <%generationslayer> how long will this go on before this acts like a real court?
