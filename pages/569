'''Apache''', formerly NCSA httpd, is a web server used by [[Over 9000|the majority]] of modern servers. The name [[allegedly]] came from a contraction of "a patchy"  web server, because over time the original httpd daemon accumulated lots of patches.

Unlike sendmail and the [[BDSM|BIND]] domain name server, Apache has had far fewer high-profile security breaches, limiting its potential for [[drama]]. That said, [[Apache]] is regularly combined and configured with the [[PHP]] Zionist scripting language and the [[MySQL]] database server. Self-taught [[13 year old boy|h4x0rz]] who create [[TL;DR|300-page]] websites about how they [[shit nobody cares about|overclocked their Roomba to function as a mobile gun turret]] regularly use their super-[[1337]] [[PHP]] coding skillz to throw up a website that [[fail|chokes and dies]] as soon as it gets linked by [[Slashdot]]. This so-called "slashdot effect" was a boon for karma whores, because it provided them with an excuse to preemptively [[copypasta]] the article into a comment and earn an instant +5 karma.
