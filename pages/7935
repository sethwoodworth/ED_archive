[http://www.proswastika.org/ '''The Swastika''' has been around for 50,000 years as a sacred symbol of peace that represents the evolution of the Universe.]

The swastika is composed of four L's, which stand for [[communism|life, luck, liberty, and love]]. The damn Nazi's stole the [[Indian|NDN]] symbol and now ndns can't use the symbol without some Jew calling them out. According to Hippies, ridding the world of [[Jews]] would achieve these four meanings, which is why [[Hitler|Adolf]] [[I did it for the lulz|did what he did]].
The fact it points in all four directions (North, East, South and West) is also seen as stability and groundedness, things hippies dread to live without.

The [[Jews]] have attempted to censor this beautiful sign for centuries, however they must be ignored, and this precious symbol should be used '''always''', particularly spray-painted in [[Ghetto|black communities]], as they ''love it''.
