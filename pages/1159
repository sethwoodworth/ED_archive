On Friday March 13th, [[2009]], an eighteen-year-old [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[b|/b/tard]] tried his first attempts at trolling the interwebs. He made a new thread on [[4Chan|4Chan's]] [[/b/]], claiming that he was going to ''shoot some people dead'' at school the next day. Somehow, however, his post came under attention of the [[serious]] internetters on [[Twitter]]. They immediately contacted the [[Old Media]], and these, smelling some delicious [[drama]] to exploit, called the Dutch police. Along with the [[FBI]] they pestered [[Moot]] until he gave up the dox of our young internet hero. Mere hours later, at 4 A.M. European time, the Dutchfag got pulled from his bed and was offered a comfortable seat in the [[Party Van|4Chan Partyvan]].

{{quote|When I'm going to school tomorrow [[lulz|I'm going to shoot some people dead]]. Look in the [[Old Media|new]] for a school shooting in the city Breda in The Netherlands. [[Unwarranted self importance|And remember me]], because I will beat [[Cho|Chu's]] Highscore.|The poor fag [[Party Van|wouldn't even make it to school...]]}}

==The Media Shitstorm kicks in==
{{quote|Best be joking nigger.|If this man would have been taken seriously, it would have saved the Dutch and American authorities tens of thousands of dollars.}}
Due to some major events that had been happening the same week in northwestern Europe, including a huge [[‎Tim Kretschmer|highschool massacre]] in [[Germany]], and a large terrorism scare in [[Drugs|Amsterdam]], our young raider's threat was taken extremely [[Serious Cat|seriously]]. The case was flooded all over tv, expensive [[Psychiatrist|psychoanalysts]] were put on to the case, the police searched his house, the local alarm warning was raised to the second highest possible ([[hitler|that's only one down from total war!]]), the military was alerted, and the [[Retard|mayor of Breda]] planned on closing all schools and child-daycare-centres for that day. After his arrest the poor guy caved in, and immediately [[Delete fucking everything|denied everything]], claiming he only did it [[for the lulz]]. Of course, it was pretty much his own fault. He had been schooled in [[CS III|ICT]], but didn't even know how to [[7 Proxies|get away from the Feds]].

==Aftermath==
On 16 March, the Dutch police decided to show that they wouldn't be fucked with, and they reported that our troll will be held in custody for at least 2 weeks longer, possibly facing a prison sentence of up to three years. On the 26th, however, the boy was released on the pretence that would help the police in a [[batshit insane|personality investigation]]. By then the kid had been in jail for 2 weeks, however, and if that didn't fuck up his life, the scars from [[Bubba]] probably did. It is unsure if our troll was forced to pay for the expenses incurred.

==A challenger appears==
On 15 March, another Dutchfag decided to add to the lulz. From behind seven proxies, he posted the following message on [[4Chan]]:

Again, the Dutch police couldn't ignore this [[Girugamesh|serious threat]]. This time, however, it was impossible to [[V&]] the guy, as he actually did something to cover his footprints. The police closed several schools in the city of Rotterdam (holding over a million inhabitants), and made sure there was police surveillance all one of the city's largest schools, the Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam. Of course, there was [[noone]] shot, and the retards at the [[DeviantART|GLR]] had a field day.

==NUMBAR 3==
Although the Dutch /b/tards are starting to get sick of this shit, another young [[CS III]] student decided to join the party late, and posted another death-threat on /b/. He said he was going to beat [[Tim Kretschmer|Tim's]] highscore this time. Actually the guy was already arrested on Friday March 13th, but the police didn't bring the news out untill next Friday, [[lulz|because they were scared it would become a hype]].
