[[At least 100 years ago|On August 15, 2008]], [[Anonymous|hackers on steroids]] raided a site going by the name of Respectance.com. Their motive for this display of [[hero|heroism]] was [[lulz|epic lulz]] at first, but it later expanded into the [[divide by zero|rebirth of /b/]], much to the pleasure of [[losers|true /b/tards]].

Supposedly, this site was meant for the creation of tributes to [[Jews|dead people]]. However, not even the dead are safe from [[Ebaumsworld|Internet hate machines]]. No, not even [[Hitler|him]].


















== What Started It All ==

[[Image:Marci.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[lol|At least it's not me]]]] A [[britfag|pioneer of justice]], who shall remain [[faggot|unknown]], picked up on a thread he saw [[At least 100 years ago|a few days ago]]. In this thread, [[bitch|a beautiful, sadly deceased woman]] was used for camwhoring material. She [[retard|fell]] out of her 9th-storey apartment, which was discovered some time after. Some lulz ensued when somebody posted her "face of death" on her tribute website, but [[lame|nothing major was gained]].

[[asking_for_it|The general conscious was that stupid cunts shouldn't go public with their grieving and ask the Internet for their BAWWWW, but instead do this in a private circle, not on the fucking Intarwebz]]. Everybody agreed. [[Niggers|Moralfags]] were [[perma-ban|slain]] in the process.

Seeing the potential of Respectance.com, the [[britfag|pioneer of justice]] proposed the idea to [[retards|/b/]] by creating a wishful thread, [[baiting|asking for /b/lackup]], abusing the tribute to Jew.

== LOL U TOTALLY POSTED SCAT ==

[[Image:Roshii.JPG|right|thumb|250px|[[Hai2u|Hai2u deadguy]]]] The thread soon attracted a lot of [[perverts|curious people]]. Needless to say, hai2u was imminent and the first picture that was uploaded to black person site.
It was apparent that this should only be the beginning. The website was flooded with [[goatse|appropriate quality content]] so heavily that it was [[dead|next to unreachable]] for [[over_9000|a good 2]] hours. Possibly DDoS attacks took place simultaneously, but this is [[bullshit|speculation]].

The LULZ everybody had in this thread reached [[over_9000|epic levels]], so that an archive-request was filed in the early hours. The thread was dubbed the rebirth and new hope of /b/, after all the [[camwhores|"POST UR FACE"]], [[emo|"scene girl"]] and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|original content]] threads that [[cancer|slowly killed /b/ from the inside]]. This was it. The [[chemo|revival]]. The [[blowjob|first aid]]. The [[sex|rebirth]].









== Aftermath ==

[[Image:Respectance.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[owned|Farewell!]]]] At some point, the thread [[baleeted|404'd]] due to [[moot|some mod]] yanking his cock up his own ass. Of course, it was re-created, more than once. It was decided that [[Germany|eBaumsworld]] is to blame for the [[EPIC_WIN|horrible, horrible immorality that Respectance.com experienced]], and thus messages were sent to [[Faux_News|FOX News]] and [[Hitler|Bill O'Reilly]], prompting them to report the news of eBaum's raids.

As previously discussed, the [[ddos|heavy (up)load]] to the website forced it down to its knees, leading [[everyone|some]] to declare it dead, giving and creating [[time_paradox|the website its own memorial on its own website its own website memorial website space]]... [[Divide by zero|OH SHII--]].

Until further notice, the [[raid|legit newsstory]] hasn't been picked up by the [[cunts|beloved accurate and honest media]].

Apparently, in one of the follow-up threads, the [[faggotry|cancer]] has struck again, almost rendering the epic lulz that were had insignificant. This was clearly the doing of a mixture of [[niggers|trolls]], [[newfags|the unknowing]], [[emos|the different]] and the [[retarded|challenged]]. /b/ was not amused.

But that's not all. All the [[good|immoral]] work done by fellow /b/ruthas has been compromised by [[morons|scriptkiddies]] who kept asking for instructions on how to DDoS the website. The spam reached [[over_9000|high]] levels and was uncontrollable at times, all due to [[emos|shitheads]] spilling over into the good lulz stuff.
