Monty Python
== An Open Letter to All Monty Python Fans ==

To all fans and friends of Monty Python, et. al.;

I thank you in advance for your taking the time to read this open letter, and respectfully request your [[Oscar Wilde|earnest]] attention. 

Like many of you, I too am a fan of dry humor, such as that for which [[England|British]] comedy is well known. It is true that this type of wit is frequently misunderstood and under-appreciated, for without a certain type of personality and an understanding of culture the humor is lost. Some of us felt alienated by our quirky tastes in jokery, deemed by more "[[Adam Sandler|mainstream]]" individuals as [[unfunny]] and [[boring]]. 

All that changed with the advent of the [[Web 1.0|internet]]. What excitement we felt when, after adding a rare gem quoted from an obscure episode of ''Flying Circus'' to one's Usenet signature, we received a positive response! Indeed, the internet turned out to be a haven for like-minded individuals, where is was easy to find another person who "gets it". It became a mark of quiet pride to declare oneself a Monty Python Fan, and to quote their work was a signal to others that you are one of those [[hipster|elite]], one who "gets it".

However, for a long time now there has been a tendency for many these individuals to [[Trying too hard|overestimate]] the value of being a Monty Python Fan. Whether this lack of understanding of social nuances is a product of the [[Web 2.0|Internet Age]] or [[aspie|innate]] in these individuals I do not know. Either way, the result is endless repetition of overused  half-witted quotes, ruining the obscurity that originally made the lines quoteable, and sucking out completely what humor (if any) there ever was in the line. 

If you will forgive me for being blunt, I will put it in simple layman's terms: '''You are not cool or elite or funny for quoting Monty Python. Shut the fuck up.'''

Therefore, I humbly ask you to curb your quoting. Thank you in advance.

My name is John, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded, no-lifes who spend every second of their day looking at stupid ass pictures. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten any pussy? I mean, I guess it's fun making fun of people because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to pictures on facebook. 

Don't be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I'm pretty much perfect. I was captain of the football team, and starter on my basketball team. What sports do you play, other than "jack off to naked drawn Japanese people"? I also get straight A's, and have a banging hot girlfriend (She just blew me; Shit was SO cash). You are all faggots who should just kill yourselves. Thanks for listening.

Hi everyone it's John here, after posting the letter I have receive a lot a death threats from you guys, I just want to say my mom got scared, and said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air." I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, "Nah, forget it. Yo, holmes to Bel-Air!" I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo homes smell ya later!" Looked at my kingdom I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.

Signed, OP.
