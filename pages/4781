'''[http://www.leekspin.com/ Leekspin]''' is an extremely annoying yet strangely addictive knockoff of the popular shock site [[meatspin.com]].  The animation is a loop of a scene taken from the [[animu]] [http://youtube.com/watch?v=ct7wi3lrqSc&mode=related&search= ''Bleach''], and the song is a nonsensical verse from a popular Finnish song called Ievan Polkka (sung by the group Loituma).  Across the internets, many children use leekspin or a variation of it (perhaps as an avatar), not knowing it is a spin-off of [[meatspin.com]].  Therefore, asking something like "Hey, isn't that a knock-off from [[Surprise|meatspin.com]]?"  can produce instant [[lulz]].  The character in question is Orihime Inoue from ''[[Bleach]]'', but she is widely known as the Loituma Girl thanks to this animation. The song track is 27 seconds long, and the video is a four frame loop.

Of course, like all good things, this meme was ruined by a [[fgt|ring tone company]]. [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2295360340367941531&hl=en]

* Adding the [http://bebo.com/app-leekspin Leekspin Bebo application] can produce many lulz, just don't expect any friends.
