Although [[Anonymous]] are called [[hackers on steroids]] and vilified by the [[Fox News|US media]], in [[Canadia]] they see things moar clearly. The [[Internet Hate Machine]], is a force for good and were dubbed an invaluable '''Internet Vigilante Group''' by the [[Party Van|Toronto Police Department]] after they were alerted to a [[Pedobear|child molester]] in their midst by this [[1337]] '''Cyber Posse''', [[basement dwellers|tireless Internets crusaders]] who doesn't afraid of anything; not even curtains nor [[Buy A Dog|dogs]]. 

After exposing [[Chris Forcand]] and his [[pedo|brb, church]] [[put shoe on head|shenanigans]] to the public at large and the [[old media]], Anonymous was awarded the [[Milk Bags|Canadian Medal of Freedom]] (which comes in bags) after their [[1337]] [http://torontosun.com/News/TorontoAndGTA/2007/12/07/4712438-sun.html sleuthing led Canadian Mounties to arrest Forcand] [[last Thursday|last Wednesday]].

Like [[:Image:Good_job_dog.jpg|McGruff The Crime Dog]], these [[trolls|fearless]] [[13 year old boys|crime stoppers]] will stop at nothing to expose all the [[CP|hypocrisy]] and [[JB|faggotry]] that has [[shitting dick nipples|r√¶ped and muddied]] our pure as driven snow Internets.

Often misunderstood as [[Exploding Van|domestic terrorists]] and [[Alex Wuori|cyber 'bullies']] these young [[hackers|crime stoppers]] are finally being rewarded for their tireless work toward a [[SFW|safer]], carefree [[Snugglenet]] [[hugbox]] for the kids.

==The Sting==

A Google search of Forcand's name or his address shows online chats a web poster had with what he believed to be [[loli|girls as young as 13]].

The [[pr0n|sexually explicit conversations]] were then forwarded to Forcand's church and a blog he wrote at http://praize.com and his name, address and phone number were posted online by [[ED]], the [[truth|paper of record]] for Anonymous and all things Internets.

Forcand's days were numbered but after a [[Cyber Posse]] from Anon's [[Internet Vigilante Group]] showed Canadian authorities a severed foot from a cleverly lain [[troll|bear trap]] that had been baited with [[loli|delicious loli]], the jig was up. DNA tests on the foot matched that of Forcand and, with that, it was to be [[brb, jail]] instead of [[brb, church]] for the [[hypocrite|devout Christian]] [[pedobear|predatory pederast]].

==Expert's Opinions==

{{quote|Before Forcand was on the police radar, those e-mail addresses had attracted the interest of [[anon|cyber-vigilantes]] who seek to out anyone who presents with a sexual interest in children.|The Toronto Sun[http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Crime/2007/12/07/4712680-sun.html]}}

{{quote|In general, although intentions can be the best, they're not police officers, they're '''[[HAHAHA|not trained in online luring]]''' and [[pedobear|online child exploitation]] investigations. They shouldn't be conducting them.|Toronto Det.-Const. Janelle Blackaddar}}

(It should be noted that Detective Constable Blackaddar is [[no girls on the internet|a wimmins and is not allowed on the Internets]] so she doesn't know what she's squawking about. Thus she should [[STFU]] and [[gb2|gb2/kitchen/]]).  Further, the notion that Anonymous is not the leading, and undisputed expert, in [[trolling|online luring]] is ripe with lulz.
