'''Victor Lewis-Smith''', [[Britain|British]] journalist and producer of TV show such as ''Inside Victor Lewis-Smith'' and ''TV Offal'', is an [[IRL]] troll and a mortal enemy of [[Chris Morris]].

Much drama ensued during the early 90s when Victor accused Chris Morris of stealing his act. Not only that, but he accused the BBC of being lenient with Morris over his stunts, which included recording a faked [[drunk]] interview with the leader of the opposition, Neil Kinnock. To this day there's a bitter rivalry between the two comedians.
