X-Play
__NOTOC__

'''X-Play''' is a shitty show on [[G4]]. The show covers [[video game]] [[POV|reviews]]. In the end, the show only proved that retards are not allowed on television.

== The Hosts ==
'''Adam [[Cancer|"Cancer"]] Sessler''' is quite possibly the biggest [[faggot]] in history. A high school drop out raped at a young age, he uses X-Play to make himself feel like he has a cock. His nearly bald head and deranged half-smile welcomes all those unfortunate enough to cum across the show.

'''Morgan [[MTF|"Manjaw"]] Webb''' is the only reason this show is popular, as she is a total tramp with giant tits that teenagers all over the country want to fuck as they fap to every review she does. However, there was much [[butthurt]] when Morgan married Bob Barker, an man old enough to be her abusive step-father. Despite being unable to get it up with the help of Viagra, Morgan became his legal whore due to the fact that he is the the God of iTunes and therefore richer than China (hey, worked for [[Anna Nicole Smith]], right?) If you want to piss off weepy little cunts who jack off to her, tell 'em [[fact|she married a millionaire]]..

'''Blair Herter''' is an awkward creep who doesn't know how to host a segment without being awkward or creepy.

Since X-Play has run out of ideas ages ago, they decided to steal other peoples host such as Kevin Pereira from [[Attack of the Show]] and Kristin Adams, who is the only decent thing they give us now from 10+ years of torture. Might as well watch [[Comedy Central|Cartoon Network]] at this point.

== The Show ==
X-play is about as much as a "show about gaming" as [[Tatu]] is a band consisting of [[lesbians]] - both may appear to be so, but in the end, it's all [[bullshit]].

The only reason why people bother watching X-play [[Fact|isn't for Morgan's rack]], or because they need a good laugh at the stupidity/expense of the hosts (yes, ''that'' painful to watch). It's because every once in awhile, a game will come out from a big, [[lie|popular game series]] and Adam and Morgan will manage to do a [[Lie|decent review]] on it. 

But those are only in special cases. And even then, the review is still painful to [[truth|watch]].

90% of the time, the [[you are doing it wrong|"game reviews" aren't even a review of anything]]. It often contains [[retard|a skit]] that gets old before long before it even starts, and pop-up ads for [[G4]]'s other [[shitty]] programming. They manage to squeeze a few sentences about the game in there, but it's so full of scripted bias that it's hard to tell until the final score is revealed. Really makes you wonder if they've even [[lie|played the games that they are reviewing]].

== Score ==
Unfortunately for Adam, this is the only [[buttsecks|score]] he will ever get (other than Morgan, but nerds doesn't count). An unadvertised game normally gets a 3 (no matter how good/shitty it is), and a 5 is usually given to any game you've already had [[oral|shoved down your throat]]. Occasionally they'll give a [[Gay|Final Fantasy]] game a 1, but chances are it's mostly just to [[Lulz|piss off the fans]].
