MR HAI
MR HAI was a well-known [[troll]] on the [[totse|totse.com]] forums. He created threads with the title "HAI TO YOU!" and the content "BAI!", as well as many other combinations that worked to that effect. He was an obvious troll and created [[lulz]].

== Creation ==
 
MR HAI was created in mid-September 2006, a little while after the [[HTS-Noob|HTS-Noob Highlighter incident]]. His job: Trolling Spurious Generalities, the general forum of totse. He quickly gained popularity from the members, but the [[Nazis|moderators]] had different opinions. The constant trolling dragged on for months, eventually losing users favor out of annoyance at constant troll threads. 


== Death ==

MR HAI eventually died because of the new VBulliten forum system, introduced in early 2007, which made it harder to troll. Also, icon10.gif, (his face) was removed from the [[totse]] forums as a post header.

==Possible Resurrection==
MR. HAI has appeared on the new [[Zoklet]].net forums, since totse went [[Batshit Insane]]. Whether or not it is the real MR. HAI is unknown.
