'''Norm MacDonald''' is a [[lulz|bone-dry]] [[Canadian]] comic and one of television's greatest trolls as of August 2008 when he [[pwnt|roasted]] [[Bob Saget]]. Prior to this, he made a living off being a [[snarky]] Canadian with arcane jokes and sub-Adam Sandler films like '''"Dirty Work,"''' the sitcom "''Norm,''" and doing the [[LNN|news]] on ''[[unfunny|Saturday Night Live]]'' for a while, being generally fucking hilarious but underrated. In fact, when he got [[b&]] from the show for being so lulzy it went over [[derp|everyone's head]], an honor previously held by [[troll|Andy Kaufman]]. 

A year or so later, he was finally 'forgiven' and was invited to host [[SNL]]. Norm accepted and {{youtube|NHTlmJ2ttPc}} trolled the fuck out of Lorne Michaels.

If you've been paying attention for the last few years, many [[lulzy|uncomfortable]] moments have been had thanks to Norm, i.e. repeatedly calling [[Micheal Jackson]] a [[homosexual]] [[pedobear|pedophile]] and saying that [[O.J.]] [[true|did it]] on SNL.

== Trolling [[Bob Saget]] ==
The [[lulz]] of this situation is inconceivable. Basically, Norm appeared on [[Comedy Central]]'s '''''Roast of Bob Saget''''' with nothing but [[shit]]ty puns and [[unfunny]] [[shit|jokes]]. Speculation (and clips of him writing on the same damn paper off which he read) leads us to believe that he improvised everything on the spot, which is [[gay|awesome]]. He also forced millions of Americans to sit through his shit, making him worse than [[Hitler]].

Sadly, Norm's incessant trolling went straight over the heads of most of the American people, and many considered him unfunny. They [[lost|were]] [[the game|right.]]
