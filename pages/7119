<s>RunEscape</s> [http://www.runescape.com/ '''RuneScape'''] (or rather WombScape, considering it's played by children), is an [[MMORPG]] made by [[Jagex]] that is hands-down one of the '''SHITTIEST''' Java games to exist. Not only does it boast SEGA CD quality graphics and an [[Fat Larry's Band|amazing musical score]] that would make Beethoven himself cry, but you have to spend <s>'''$5.95+''' dollars USD</s> $5.95 a month to use the extra features such as [http://www.runescape.com/kbase/viewarticle.ws?article_id=2904 catching faeries with a net] and [http://www.runescape.com/kbase/guid/penguin_hide_and_seek playing hide and seek with penguins!]

The game used to be the largest breeding ground of [[Powerbook|scammers]], [[hackers]], [[Cleverbot|Macroers]], [[aspie]]-addled [[13 year old boys]], [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] [[Fat|fatties]] and [[Persians]] until Jagex practically destroyed their own game towards the end of 2007. Now it is just filled with [[newfag]]s and a bunch of [[cocksucker]]s who support Jagex [[trying too hard|in their attempt to rid their game of cheaters]].

Jagex are also the masters of marketing, as ''RuneScape'' has also proven to be [[addictive]]. Most players who quit claim they [[virgin|never had fun]] but were actually just addicted to the [[crack]] that is ''RuneScape'', creating [[hookers and blow|unhealthy lifestyles]]. If [[you]] actually played it, you'd realize how [[Ronald Reagan|inexplicably evil]] it is and how it needs to end soon.

==Features==
[[Image:Rsinflation.jpg|thumb|right|Runescape's economy in a nutshell.]]
*Building relationships with older men whilst they masturbate at their computer and arrange to meet you alone in a deserted alleyway.
*[[Epic]] and adrenaline-rushing gameplay which consists in spending countless hours a day leveling up a particular skill such as [[farming]], fishing or woodcutting just so you can get a '[[RuneScape#Capes of Achievement|99 skill cape]]' and [[360 kid|showing everyone online that you did]].
*Rampant GP inflation that makes the Great Depression look like a good economy making [[Fullmetal Alchemist|alchemy]] (a magic spell which turns shit into gold) as useful as [[you|your]] [[penis]]. 
*[[All caps]] is disallowed, however capitalizing the first letter of each word isn't. Good luck, have fun.
*Ability to [[Phishing|Phish]] naive children's accounts and selling them on [[Ebay]].
*Top quality graphics that are unrivaled by other games such as [[Guild Wars]].
*<s>[[Zezima]]</s> [[ALL CAPS|NOT ANYMORE!]] Supposedly he nowadays spends his pathetic life in [[Jagex#Moar_Games_Besides_RuneScape|Funorb]] [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|playing even moar failed games by jagex]]. Since [[Zezima]] vanished, nerds have been fighting with each other to get to the top of the hiscores and show who have wasted their life the most.
*A chat filter that will censor almost everything you say, except for buttfuckers, buttfucked, and skullfucked (no kidding), (go ahead, type a sentence and see how many of these *** come up).
*Plenty of [[Nazi|elitist]] guilds of high level players who build pyramid schemes and [[circle jerk]] each other whilst scamming the noobs who have not yet realised that they are not the ones "making millions daily" when joining a merchant clan.
*A nice, friendly online community of [[13 year old boys]], who often dress up as [[16-year-old girls]] to attract small children into their private clan chats.
*The ability to build and own a virtual house [[Habbo Hotel|where you can throw mad 'house parties'. Invite all your e-friends, and pretend you are actually that cool IRL to host a party]].
*Laugh at [[free]] players without members accounts, because they don't have the ability to [[gay|catch fairies with a net]].
*Laugh at [[elite|members]] who pay for their accounts, because they're wasting 6 bucks just so they can [[irony|catch fairies with a net]].
*Reporting everyone for anything to become a player [[moderator]]!
*If someone has a lower level than [[you]], he's a [[noob]]. If someone has a higher level than you, he has [[truth|no life]].

== Types of ''RuneScape'' Players ==

[[Image:Runescape's closed.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pool's closed|''Runescape'''s closed]] due to [[AIDS]].]]
[[Image:Pedobear RS.gif|thumb|left|[[Pedobear]] owns a ''RuneScape'' account too.]]

Much like players of [[Maplestory|any other]] [[World of Warcraft|popular MMORPG]], Runsecape players have a severe addiction to the game resembling that of crack or crystal meth due to the fact that Runescape is available just about anywhere and is $5 a go. Runescape addicts advance further and further down an [[Gurren Lagann|angry downward death spiral]], eventually doing '''ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING''' to get their fix including burglary, prostitution, mugging and endlessly begging their parents to let them use their PayPal account for just one more month of runescape membership. The Scapehead will end up staying up 24 hours subsisiting on instant ramen for breakfast, lunch and dinner while playing Runescape. The addiction usually ends when the 'Scapehead's parents decide to ban their failed abortion from the computer, send him to one of those fly-ass rehab places in Cali and [[unrealistic expectations|eventually become productive members of society]].

*'''[[Noob|Noobs/Newfags]]''' - Every MMO has noobs and ''RuneScape'' is no exception. Noobs are incredibly [[gullible]], [[naive]] and will obey any orders you give them about 95% of the time; therefore, they are the biggest [[lol-cow]]s in the game. When they're not busy [[fellatio|sucking your cock]], they will be begging for ''RuneScape'' gold because they are [[You|too stupid or lazy to make their own]]. To combat this, Jagex have implemented many updates to make it easier for newfags to make pixel gold.

*'''[[Mundane|Average Players/Moderatefags]]''' - The next stage after newfaggery. The 'moderatefags' of ''RuneScape'' tend to be a considerable deal [[smart]]er than newfags; however, they are still dumb as [[You|fuck]]. Moderatefags populate most of ''RuneScape'', and are always frantically trying to raise their skills so they can achieve [[Fail|pro]] status. 

*'''[[Pro|Pros/Profags]]''' - The true [[No Life|no-life]]rs of the game, pros are [[at least 100|always level 100 or above]] and are the equivalent [[jock]]s in RuneScape. They have fuck-loads of RuneScape gold and have extremely high skills. Whilst all the [[Pathetic|noobs and moderatefags look up to these jocks]], the rest of the internet [[no one likes you|looks at them with utter disdain]]. Pros never talk in-game  but occasionally will utter a sentence to prevent noobs and average players from reporting them to Jagex for macroing. A [[train]] of noobs will always be [[attention whore|following a pro as he shows off his endgame shit]]. '''See also [[Zezima]]'''

*<B>[[Cooldude|Cooldudes]]/[[oldfag|Oldfags]]</B> - The cooldudes of ''RuneScape'' are [[o rly|not necessarily pros]]. To classify as an oldfag, you must have been playing [[the game]] since [[2001]]-[[2003]], back when ''RuneScape'' was in its [[Web 1.0|Web 0.25]] stages and known as '''RuneScape'' [[old|Classic]]'. Oldfags have been around to see every [[drama]]-generating event that has ever occurred on ''RuneScape''. Like most oldfags, they [[nobody cares|tend to complain about how ''RuneScape'' has changed and that back in the day there were considerably less]] [[13 year old boys]].

*'''[[n00b|noobtards]] with [[lie|membered]] [[Cooldude|cool]] [[whore|girls]]''' -the [[retard|most retarded species of gamers]] in all,spending time in their [[love|girlfiends/boyfriends dancing and chatting at each other]] [[lie|romantically]],Sad P-Mods who doesnt have girlfriends/boyfriends are the [[rage|most ruthless]] players, players dancing and saying <nowiki>''I love you''</nowiki> will [[hax|mute]] them.

==How Fagex [[rape|changed]] the game==
In recent months, Jew got the [[brilliant]] idea that RuneScape wasn't giving them enough jewgold and went and shat all over [[the game]]. You can now expect RuneScape to pleasure you with an increased number of advertisements, [[scam|trial]] membership ([[blank check|just fill out your credit card number and social security number]]), and [[buttsecks|backing]] by [[profit]]eering graphics card manufacturers. <s>Oh, and they raided the RSBot website.</s> So the clever and witty people changed it to 'Powerbot'. <----- cwatthaydidthar?

==Typical ''RuneScape'' Scams==
[[Image:RS scam.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Nigeria]]n [[scam]] artist at work.]]
[[Last Thursday|Once upon a time]], ''RuneScape'' was one of the easiest games to [[scam]] [[gullible]] [[Fred|simpletons]] for all their pixelated worth. But then, beginning sometime in 2007, Jagex went on a [[rage|berserk]] [[Columbine|rampage]] and practically [[holocaust|eliminated scamming from the game]] with a series of updates and [[change]]s that were supposed to 'save' it. Most of these don't work now, but as you can imagine when they did, many [[lulz]] were had.

*'''Jagex blocks your p[[ass]]''' - An old [[Longcat|classic]]. Player A would scream out "[[Christfag|HOLY]] [[SHIT]]!! JAGEX [[Cock Block|BLOCKS YOUR PASSWORD]] LOOK!!!! ***********." [[Dumb]] [[fuck]]s would generally fall for this and proceed to type their password in the chat log for everyone to see, and would later be [[Phished]] after they logged off. [[Irony|Ironically]], Jagex eventually DID make it so that your password would be blocked.

*'''Jagex Impersonator''' - One of the few scams that still holds up today, but only works on [[newfag]]s. Player A [[Identity theft|pretends to be a member of Jagex]] and goes around [[the game]] looking for suckers. Once one is found, player A messages them saying "Oh hi. I'm a Jagex [[Mod]]. Tell me your password and I can give you free st00f. Only noobs fall for this, as most players know Jagex mods have [[Burger King|gold crowns]] next to their names, to show they're better then [[you]]

*'''Alt F4 and Ctrl W''' - One of the [[old]]est scams in the game. Player A finds a [[fucktard]] who is desperate to make more money in the game. Player A tells Player B to [[Google Drop|drop]] all his items and press Alt F4 or Ctrl [[W]]. This would cause Player B's browser to close and Player A can then [[loot]] his [[shit]]. Unfortunately this scam no longer works as of [[RuneScape#Judgement Day|10th December 2007]].

*'''Teleporting Scam''' - Player A would offer to [[portal|teleport]] a noob to a location of interest (eg. [[Nawlins|Falador]], [[Wall Street|Varrock]] etc) but instead would teleport the noob to a PvP zone known as the [[Ghetto|Wilderness]], where a group of Player A's '[[friends]]' were waiting to [[rape|fuck him]] up.

*'''Item Swapping''' - Only the most [[Dane Cook|fucktarded of fucktards]] fall for this. Basically, Player A would trade with Player [[B]] and offer some valuable pixel shit. Player B would then offer an insane amount of money. Player A would then decline the trade and say '[[Oh noes|Oh shit]] sorry [[I accidentally]] misclicked' and then trade again. This time he would offer something much less valuable that looks similar to the original item. [[Owned|Player B accepts, Player A logs off and then 5 minutes later Player B realizes what a fucking tard-munch he is]] and hopefully [[Maarten|kills himself]]. 

*'''Fishing''' - A really strong player around the 100's would hire a noob for maybe only 100 gold to find a player around the 50's and lure him into the [[goatse|wilderness]] so the 100 level player would kill the 50 and take all his [[shit]]. The noob would leave happy with his extremely small amount of gold, the 100 level player would take his new shit, and the 50 level player would become [[an hero]].
==Customer "Support"==
[[Image:Swatsiget.png|thumb|right|[[Hitler|Heil Zamorak]]!]]
Of all the things that make ''RuneScape'' [[fail]], their [[Microsoft|Customer Support team]] has to be number one. Jagex have a [[Retard|special]] system for banning whereby they wipe [[shit]] all over your account (also known as 'black marks'). These black marks build up as you break rules. Because of this absolute failure of a customer support you will get [[b&]] once you reach 60 out of 10 of these black marks.

Assuming you get slapped by the [[banhammer]], you can appeal your case. Don't bother trying to write a sincere and apologetic appeal though, as your shit will get handled by an automated [[Mysterybot]]-esque machine that is worse than [[Hitler]]. You will most definitely receive an automated reply within a minute of submitting your appeal, that 99.9% of the time rejects it.

Instead, [[troll]] the fuck out of them. Fit in as many swear words as possible and tell them you fucked their respective [[MILF|mothers]]. Pretend to have bad [[Engrish|english]], say you're dying of [[cancer]] and threaten to sue them if they deny your appeal.

Alternatively, you can create as many accounts as possible and get them all banned, then [[exploitable|exploit]] the machine and hopefully it will over[[cum|load]] with brain [[semen]].

As of now, customer support has made the fucked up idea of allowing players to skip the tutorial. For some lulz, you can make an account, spam some shit up and make 1337 fagolas cry.

==Skillz==
[[Image:Runecape-woodcutting-animation.gif|thumb|right|[http://www.runescape.com/kbase/viewarticle.ws?article_id=1717 Woodcutting,] the most popular skill on ''RuneScape''. Watch as your character pathetically misses the tree and somehow still manages to [[Erection|attain wood]].]]
Like all MMO's, ''RuneScape'' features a large variety of exciting and innovative skillsets such as:

*[[KILL IT WITH FIRE|'''Firemaking''']] Point and click on your tinderbox and use it on the logs as you get caught up in all the [[Fail|adrenaline and excitement]] as you watch your logs burn out.

*[[redneck|'''Farming''']] Plants seeds at various locations and wait [[forever|20 hours for them to grow]]. By the way, you have to pay to train this crap. 

*[[Felching|'''Fletching''']] This exciting skill allows you to stand in the same spot for hours on end clicking on a knife as you make [[over 9000|thousands upon thousands]] of bows. And if ''that'' wasn't enough for you, you also have to pay to use this skill!

*[[body builder|'''Agility''']] Not once will you ever get to rest in this skill! You'll constantly be pumping your legs as your [[fat]] pixelated character tries to drag his legs across an obstacle course (the irony is that whilst your character is getting fit, you get fatter as you sit at your computer all day). Feel the burn as you get [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_Tunnel_syndrome Carpal Tunnel Syndrome!] How's that for a reward for wasting $6 dollars a month on this extra content that you could've just done [[IRL]] and possibly improved your pathetic life?

*'''Combat skills''' - Yay! Max out 5 skills ([[domestic violence|Attack]], [[steroids|Strength]], [[defense|Defence]], [[Harry Potter|Magic]] and [[school shooting|Ranging]]) by doing [[MASSIVE DAMAGE|9,75 FUCKING MILLION DAMAGE]]! And other 2 ([[Christfag|Prayer]] and [[Magic|Summoning]]) by [[wat|burying bones]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh!|summoning monsters]].

The rest of the supposed 'skills' [[samefag|are all the same]]. All you have to do is click on something and then your [[sock puppet|character]] will automatically do everything for you, the point is [[no life|doing this around 325,000 times until you get level 99 in the desired skill]]. Other skills include [[Cock|Woodcutting]], [[Phishing|Fishing]], [[Fisting|Mining]], [[drugs|Herblore]] and [[at least 100]] others that are horribly repetitive.

There are 2 skills which deserve their own sections though, see them below.

===Summoning===
[[Image:Guy_with_Bulldog.gif|thumb|This image made a million nerds [[cum|cream]] themselves simultaneously.]]
Sometime in mid-late 2007, Jagex [[I came|leaked]] an image (see the one on the right) which immediately [[Y2K|caused the systems to crash]], as the forums were filled [[psychic|with crystal balls and wild predictions]] of [[fail|what it would lead to]]. Later on that year, Jagex [[Strip|teased]] a major update slated for release at the end of 2007 or start of 2008. It turned out to be an incredibly [[gay]] skill known as [[magic|Summoning]].

Those who had quit after Judgment Day soon wished they hadn't because this [[Lie|epically cool]] update meant you could own a pet dog! That's right motherfuckers, you can now [[rape|own]] a pet dog in ''RuneScape''! Not only that, but you can also summon a [http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Evil_turnip_%28familiar%29 turnip], [http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Compost_mound pile of shit], [http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Smoke_devil the devil], [http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/War_tortoise a Wartortle], and the fabled [http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Bunyip Bunyip]. [[No|Pretty cool huh?]]

Summoning was timed to be released several weeks after Judgment Day in order to [[fellatio|appease]] the once flourishing fanbase of ''RuneScape''. This, however could not bring back those who had quit, because despite all the things you could summon there was a severe lack of [[Mudkips]]. The closest semblance of a [[battletoads|Battletoad]] was a [http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Barker_toad Barker Toad]. FAIL.

===[[LOL WUT|Dungeoneering]]===

Yet again the faggots at jagex wanted to release another failed skill; however, this time they were going to make even more players [[shit bricks|crap their pants]]. On saturday 23 January of 2010 Fagex made both free to play and member players leviate while a red mist surrounded them, after that [[shit|animation]] they received a message reading '''[[rape|You feel a strange power unleash itself upon you]]'''.

Just like summoning, everyone started making speculations about this like jagex [[lame|releasing a new skill]] or a new [[Adventure Time|quest]].  At the end, they gave the stupid excuse that this power [[came]] from the place you train the new skill called Dungeoneering, however it is [[fact|obvious]] that [[i did it for the lulz|They did it for the lulz]] since they could have told them without making them float in the goddamn air, lulz were had for sure anyway.

Dungeoneering is supposed to be a new [[noob|grandmaster]] skill where you explore a [[vagina|dungeon]] with a [[mantrain|team]] or all by [[dying alone|yourself]], fight monsters, get keys to open doors, use your [[1337]] skills to solve [[shit|shitty]] puzzles, fight the [[final boss]] of the dungeon and lose everything you had when you continue to the next dungeon... yeah, that's pretty much it... [[btw|Btw]], does [[zelda|this sounds]] [[world of warcraft|familiar]] [[dungeons and dragons|to you]]? It also comes with 40 new songs but since runescape music [[fail|fails]] more than [[your mom|your mother]], nobody gave a shit. 
[[File:Swastikapuzzle.PNG|thumb|One of the [[Nazi|lulz]] appeared on Dungeoneering]]

[[Some argue]] Jagex came up with this skill to make runescape as [[shit|awesome]] as [[World of Warcraft|WoW]] (Both games are [[bullshit]], so [[noone|who cares]]?) and the result was this crap. Jagex, as the masters of trolling they are, decided to make this skill like a teamwork minigame, [[lie|an interesting concept]] but since Runescape players [[retard|lack the intelligence]] and the [[engrish|communication skills]] to work as a team everyone started bashing it, Jagex also made it as boring as possible and it's max level is [[at least 100|120]] instead of 99 making players waste even more time of their failed lives. Every Runescapefag has been [[raging|arguing]] about whether this skill is shit or not since its release, [[common knowledge|but we ALL know]] Runescape sucks no matter how many skills are introduced.

==Why you shouldn't play ''RuneScape''==
[[Image:Funny pic.JPG|thumb|left|If they knew they would <s>think</s> know you are a faggot.Also,the eyes[[?]]]]
[[Image:runescapestealgf.png|thumb|right|It will steal your [[lie|girlfriend]].]]
*[[Black Jesus|Fail]].
*Retarded little pre-pubescent boys pretending to be [[16 year old girls|hot teenage girls]] [[Prostitute|in order to get free money]].
*[[Wii]], no, N64-quality graphics.
*Has caused people to [[an hero|commit suicide]] in the past.
*With the removal of scamming, it is almost impossible to attain any lulz from other [[Gamer|players]].
*Your account will most likely be [[hax|hacked]] at least 5 days after creation.
*At least once a year [[Korea|a riot will break out in Falador square]] when Jagex implements a new 'revolutionary' update to the game.
*THE SKY IS ALWAYS BLACK.
*Majority of players are 13 year old boys (for real). 
*If you play RS, everyone at your [[school]]/[[work]]place will think (correctly) that [[you]] are a [[faggot]].
*Music that is so [[mindfuck|mind numbing]] that [[scientist]]s are looking into it as an alternative to the [[Harry Potter|death penalty]].
*A '''ping''' feature that pretty much defeats the whole purpose of levelling up. Someone with a mining level of 41 can easily own someone with a mining level of 85 at a mining spot because their '''ping''' is lower (another flaw amongst the countless Jagex fuck-ups).

'''Once you get past level 50, I ask [[you]] to leave the [[internet]]s and take your [[fail]] with you.'''

==Party Hats and other rare items==
[[File:Runescape crossdressing.PNG|thumb|left|thumb|The [[transsexual|pinnacle]] of RuneScape fashion.]]
[[Image:Runescape.png|thumb|right|OMG! 99 attack cape! Let's pk that noob and pile his stuff!]]
Similar to the '[[epic]]' armour available in [[WoW]], ''RuneScape'' has its fair share of worthless pixelated hogwash that noobs wish they could have, such as... A PAPER HAT!! Show off to all your friends how fucking cool you are by wearing a pixelated paper hat that came out of a christmas cracker! In real life, this would cost somewhere between 5-10 cents, but in ''RuneScape'' it costs upwards of $300,000,000 million!! FUCK ME. Can't afford a party hat? Never fear, you can always buy a ''[[Santa]] Hat''. Don't believe in [[Santa]]? Why not try an [[easter]] egg, or a [[Pagan|Halloween]] mask instead? Still not convinced? We'll throw in a pumpkin too! Still not satisfied? [[ALL CAPS|FINE THEN, FUCK YOU]][[oneoneone|!!!11!1]].

Thousands of players [[jizz]] in their pants whenever they see a [[cooldude]] walking down the road with his Party hats and other rare and valuable items. Immediately players will [[zerg rush]] said cooldude and beg money off of him. Other rare items include [[Dragon]] armour, [[Zombie|Barrows]] armour and Godswords (that's right, you actually get to use the sword of GOD).


===Capes of Achievement===
In another attempt to appease their players, Jagex released the Capes of Accomplishment (also known as Skill Capes, 99 Capes, Achievement Capes and '[[OH WOW|Oh Wow]], I Just Wasted 6 Months Grinding Up A [[Skill]] So I Can Show Off My Pixelated Cape To My friends So That We Can All [[Circlejerk]] Each Other' Capes which exist to signify that a particular player has absolutely [[no life]], no [[girlfriend]], no [[friends]] and no [[dick]]. To get these capes you have to max out a skill. When a player wears a skill cape, he will immediately be attacked by a pack of rabid noobs screaming 'EMOTE PLOX!!!!' (each cape comes with a [[retarded]] emoticon). Skill capes also cause players to suffer from high levels of [[USI]].

===Party Hat Glitch===
[[Image:Dylock dupe 8.gif|thumb|right|Dylock in action.]]
Sometime in November 2003, a hax0r by the name of [[dead|Sixfeetunder]] used a program to successfully duplicate party hats. This sent the game's economy into its own [[Epic|Great]] [[Depression]], as he began lending party hats to people that could not repay him back.

Incidentally, other [[faggot]]s caught on and Sixfeetunder began sending copies of the program to other hackers and completely fucked the game up, manifesting party hats tenfold. Soon even your average noob had a party hat. Realizing the program was a success, people began using it for other shit (like duplicating materials such as ores and [[dildo]]s). This fucked up the economy even more, as prices for every imaginary pixelated item began [[orgasm|fluctuating]] [[gay|wildly]]. Jagex, [[Truth|because they are the worst gaming devlopers ever]], did not know how this 'glitch' worked or how to [[Goatse|fix]] it, and it went on for several days as the game spiralled into [[chaos]].

However, they are most certainly the cleverest [[troll]]s and [[liar]]s in the history of the [[internet]]. Jagex responded to the 'glitch' by offering free 'lifetime membership' for anyone who could explain to them how the program and glitch worked. One of the people using the program, [[retard|Dylock]], thought he could get away with it and get free lifetime membership, and messaged Jagex telling them about the program, how it worked, and a list of players who were using it (not including himself). Jagex then [[owned|permanently banned his account and all others involved and fixed the glitch over the proceeding days]], and of course, the free lifetime membership was denied.

==[[Columbine|Falador Massacre]]==
An event that players refer to as the ' ''Falador Massacre'' ' occurred many years ago, on June 6th, 2006 (coincidence? I think not!). Following the release of [[House|Player-Owned-Houses]] which you upgrade by training the '''Construction''' skill, the typical ''RuneScape'' nerds raced to see who would get 99 first. The first person to do this was '''Cursed You'''. He held a [[party hard|party]] in his house to celebrate, where a fuckload of people turned up. Knowing there were too many, he [[gtfo|kicked everyone out of the house]].

But then a glitch occurred whereby some lucky faggot had the ability to kill players outside of PvP zones. This lol-[[troll]] (whose name was [[In Utero|Durial321]]) proceeded to a crowded [[server]]and approached the wonderful city of Falador. He then began to [[fuck]] [[bitch]]es up, and in doing so attained [[God]] status amongst players. He began chasing and killing noobs around with his [[cock|whip]].

Several mods caught onto this, but for some reason instead of banning him, they yelled at everybody to get away from him. Seriously, Jagex must give their mods some rather pathetic abilities. There is only one known video of this instance, but unfortunately the [[faggot]] who recorded it put some shitty Nightwish music in the video before he uploaded it.

The [[Columbine|rampage]] continued for over an hour, looting such valuable shit as a [[Leprechaun|Green party hat]] which is only expensive because dumb niggers who play this game can't afford green dye and paper. Finally, after a good deal of trolling, Jagex got their heads out of their asses and banned him. Epic lulz were had. And thus ended the legacy of [[In Utero|durial321]]. From thenceforth, many retards have attempted to immitate durials pwnage, but [[fail|none have succeeded]].

==Judgement Day==
{{quote|Wilderness's closed due to [[China|real world traders.]] |Jagex, crushing the hearts of [[nobody cares|millions.]]}}

[[Image:Runescape facepalm.jpg|thumb|right|[[Facepalm|A Pker after Judgement Day, lamenting on the years he wasted his pathetic life on the game]].]]
On the 10th of December 2007, all [[You|hell]] broke loose. Every time Jagex updates [[the game]], a little message in the corner appears saying an update will happen in 3 minutes, with a timer counting down. On this particular night, every [[basement dweller|player]] was excited in anticipation of the annual [[Christmas]] event. When they were logged off and read the front page, they realized it was something much more [[Evil|sinister]]. Jagex had removed trading, [[murder|Player killing]] and [[liberalism|decided to give free players more bank space]]. Yay! 

Following this, the RS forums were flooded with the [[fist]] of [[Furry|fury]] as the [[Gamer|players]] of RS went fucking crazy. The forums [[404]]'d because there was just too [[fail|many people posting]]. A lot of players rage quit [[the game]] that day. There were even a few threatening to [[an hero|commit suicide]] on the forums (for real). [[Muslim|Riots]] [[I came|erupted]] in-game. Massive [[protest]]s were being held in the major cities of ''RuneScape''. A few of the servers even [[Pwn|crashed]]. Major [[lulz]] were had in that day.

Jagex claimed this was all to stop [[HACKERS ON STEROIDS|macroers]] and [[Basement Dweller|scammers]], but in reality, Andrew Gower is [[Trolldin]] and was just doing it for the [[lulz]]. Later on Jagex felt [[troll's remorse]] and decided to make some ''slight'' changes to these updates, whilst still getting rid of trading and [[Pwn|player killing]]. Soon half of the player base had quit RS, and presumably half of those committed suicide (victory for society!).

Clever and witty players began calling the game '' '[[BRILLIANT!|RuinedScape]]' ''.

However, on December 21, 2010, Jagex announced they would have a vote to decide the future of the wilderness and free trade. This caused a massive amount of shit being thrown onto the forums, and riots of no-lifers running around in pink skirts. Jagex is probably only doing this for the lulz, since they're only aiming for another world record. They made the shit mistake of the only option on the vote being 'Yes', and you can practically enter anyone's username, even if they don't want to vote.

Are you [[BAWWWWW|sick and tired]] of rampant inflation, pointless random events, broken animations, pointless updates and other players not playing mini-games correctly? ([[All caps|WELL FUCKING QUIT THEN.]])

Then the official run-escape forums (RSOF) are the place for you! instead you can [[bitch| complain]] to the [[no-one| wider player community]] and the [[Unwarranted Self Importance|p-mods]] / J-mods, to your heart's content as long as you are either a member or have over 12.5 million xp in the free to play section. 

RuneScape is populated by christfags, bisexuals and faggots who think they're awesome however most of the population consists of [[13 year old boys]] who are still innocently unaware of the [[goatse|more shocking elements]] of the internets; thanks to this, there are many lulz to be had from the fan base.

It is also a [[fact]] most 'women' in runescape are fat ass children molesters fapping to their 99 defence. So whenever you see one posting some tl;dr opinion or suggestion about anything, feel free to troll 'her' as much as you want.

Easier topics to start a flame war with:

#Claiming one God ([[Jesus|Saradomin]], [[Satan|Zamorak]] or [[Hippy|Guthix]]) is better than another.
#Claiming PvP is now fixed and can in no way be improved.
#Claiming to have significantly moar money than everyone else.
#That a skill is obsolete or pointless.
#That f2p needs/deserves new items/spells/weapons.
#That p2p already has all these things and for £3.50 a month, so can you.
#[[????]]
#[[old meme|Profit!]]

When traveling across the vast emptiness of RuneScape please be aware the number of [[13 year old boy|educated and articulate]] players with their [[retarded|clever]] [[rage|comments]] that you are bound to experience as demonstrated by these quotes:

Hello everyone, I'm here to unfold the great life I've had through the years of playing RuneScape, and share my ventures with the public. I believe in everything that happens in RuneScape, can happen In Real Life, because RuneScape is educational. 

---- 

I've learned many things from playing this game. For one, I've learnt the arts of cooking in real life. By watching how it's done here, I quickly imitated and acquired the skills of placing my empty hands right into the fire that I had made in my backyard and magically receiving cooked meat out of thin air. <- I don't have much success with the last part  

What confuses me here is - between every meal, I must cover my hands in ice, otherwise I'll be struggling with massive, burning pains, but I don't have to in Runescape, why is this? 

I would also like to share that I'm having marvellous troubles carrying 28 raw sharks or any other kind of fish in my backpack. Why!? Am I not strong enough? I have counted the slots in my bag! There are 28! Just like on RuneScape. Must be due to some temporary programming faults. Fix this please, Jagex

realized how it's possible to go without food for days, and most likely only eat if you're fighting, or have been fighting. So, I tried walking up to a random person deep in the dead forrest and just punched them in the chest. What happened after, wasn't very pretty - I got beat up sincerely bad and was not able to retaliate. I struggled with stuffing this giant trout down my throat in one bite, while he was hitting hard on me. All of a sudden, this red fluid or liquid started pouring out of me. This doesn't happen on RuneScape. Does anyone know what it is?? 

After that, some clan with all members dressed in blue, spamming "stop! police!" were running towards me, I found that unfair and pulled out my Dragon Dagger, which I've painted red since I could not find one in the store. I inserted my dagger into them and swifted it back and forth to perform the special attack. This only evolved into more of this redness I had all over myself. They knocked me down with some black sticks, and I tried pushing the trout down my throat again. Didn't help. 

Later I was in this room with one small window and bars. Weird. I tried sitting down, drawing circles around me, but it didn't teleport me. Glitch, maybe? But I was stuck in there for several years. Maybe this was the black hole. 
Earlier this year, I got a girlfriend called Hotgurl_63. We made one baby together in bed and called him My_Son_58, I love the both of them so much. I met Hotgurl_63 in a city called Varrock. 

I also don't get this. I've been looking for a fish store for days now to buy pre-cooked fish that has been stored for hundreds of days. 
All I find are these shops called "McDonalds" - "Burger King" and "KFC". What is this!? They sell sandwiches I've never seen before, and this "KFC" clan does chicken like a whole new way of life. 

The store owners always ask "do you want that as a combo?" I'm like "what the heck? Are you going to dragon claw special hit combo me?" Then the clerks watch me strangely.

Today (17-Jul-2009) I went to the plaza. Saw some guards and such. I remembered how lovely it was to pickpocket the guards on RuneScape. So I thought, why not give it a shot? 
There were an amazing amount of people surrounding me and the guard, but I knew that they wouldn't give a damn, just like on RuneScape. 

I went straight up to the guard and pickpocketed him from the front. The swift 3-second move of using both hands without touching the victim at all. 
It was a straight failure, he got furious like they would on RuneScape, but what the hell happened next? I was suddenly handcuffed by the guard, and everybody were watching. 
The man forced me down to the ground. I tried to run, rest, teleport, fight back, but couldn't do anything at all. 

Out of nowhere that notorious blue-dressed clan comes up again with their wannabe karils *-bows, spamming "EVERYBODY GET THE $#%^# DOWN!" 
I fainted at some point. Later I, once again, woke up in this grey room with one small window and bars - home teleport yet again, out of function. 
Now I wanted to try not eating anything for a long period, which I've learnt from RuneScape, is possible. Saves a lot of money. I started getting weaker, thinner and in the end, I fell to my knees and down to the ground, Like on RuneScape. WHYYY? 

Multiple times I've been kicked out from my bank. Once I had been charged with something they called "theft". All i did was go into the bank, open up my account and withdraw a lot of money. I tried to deposit a dragon dagger, whip, a bag of lobsters and a whole shark. They pulled "charges" on me for the dagger and asked me disturbing questions about the whip. Why!? 

In the end, i've come to question myself. What am i doing wrong? I can't even cook without it hurting me so much. I can't eat a whole shark in one bite. Well, I'm working on it. Maybe takes practice. Could be a lot of glitches!|Killingfree [http://forum.runescape.com/forums.ws?129,130,974,59193506 4 posts!! what a nerd]}}|color=lightblue}}

==High Resolution Graphics==
[[Image:Rs goatse.jpg|thumb|right|A brave [[noob|player]] ventures into the [[goatse|deep wilderness]]....]]
In July 2008, Jagex released ''RuneScape'' in 'HD'. Now instead of viewing RS in [[SNES]] quality graphics you can now view them in [[fail|N64 quality graphics!]], a major development in the graphical department of video games. Not only that, but they made it into full-screen as well, so now your entire computer screen can be filled with fail. Along with HD came exciting new character models, [[shitty art|featuring humungous heads!]] Now everyone's character looks like [[Invader Zim]].

[[Seriously]], these graphics are [[lie|fucking awesome]]. They shit all over [[Crysis]], [[Killzone 2]], [[Assassin's Creed]], [[Guild Wars]], [[Metal Gear Solid|Metal Gear Solid 4]], [[Soul Calibur|Soul Calibur 4]], [[I see what you did there|Wikipedia]], [[Mass Effect]], [[Gears of War]], [[Grand Theft Auto|GTA 4]] and any other game you could possibly think of!

All [[sarcasm]] aside, there were actually players who were too [[poor]] to afford a computer decent enough to run this 'HD', and they immediately began unleashing their fury on the ''RuneScape'' forums (as players usually do). Jagex, as well as all the normal players who could afford a [[PC]] that was made after 1998 proceeded to ignore these faggots, and presumably they all left [[the game]].

==Ways to Player-Kill [[IRL]]==
[[Image:An_Runescape_Hero.png|right|thumb|Maartens suicide note.]]
[[Maarten]] aka '''maarten16020''', was an [[emo]] [[13 year old boy|fourteen year old boy]] who decided to become [[An Hero]] after his ''RuneScape'' account was [[hacking|hacked]] by one of [[pedo|his IRL friends]]. [[bullshit|Maarten's friend]] reportedly hacked into his ''RuneScape'' account and stole 11 million ''RuneScape'' gold from him causing Maarten to fall into [[wambulance|depression]]. He posted a [[grammar nazi|poorly written]] suicide note on his [[shit nobody cares about|clan's]] thread (Ironically, his clan was called HoF-[[anhero|Heros]] of the future) to tell them that he was sick of life and say goodbye to all his [[e-pals]] before hanging himself. Since he became [[an hero]] just about every runefag on the planet visits his youtube channel daily to masturbate over him.

Also, yes, it's true. Just playing this game makes you want to KILL yourself. So did the ''RuneScape'' player, "FatWrecked".

===[[Internet Celebrities|Runescape Celebrities]]===
[[Image:Runescape Machinima.jpg|right|thumb|[[furry|Tehnoobshow plays with stuffed dolls. Kinda what Supermariologan does. too bad he doesn't play Prunescape]] and [[attention whore|make videos with them]].]]
[[Image:Orb_Of_Oculus_Glitch.png|right|thumb|The orb of oculus, released by jagex to help [[13-year-old|children]] make moar unfunny videos (also note the [[penis|boner]])]]Children Scamming drama aside, there was a time when players used to have high levels of [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|USI]] so they decided to post videos of them playing runescape trying to be funny or showing their [[nerd|Pro]] stats, obviously resulting in unfunny pieces of shit. However, there were some that attracted the attention of the [[13-year-old boy|13 year old boys]] and the people who made them became celebrities, some of them are: 
*[[old|'''Excl''']] A talentless video maker who is 33 years old, married and has 2 kids (no, [[seriously]]), he started making boring music videos but [[lie|slightly improved]] over the time by doing [[wat|runescape comedy sketches]] (whatever that is), however the only people who find him funny are his fans who are runescape addicts that think jokes about runescape are [[unfunny|totally hilarious]]. His popularity skyrocketed when he won the Runescape [[Machinima]] competition (see below) and now he is as popular as tehnoobshow, but unlike him, Excl actually [[secks|gets some pussy]] [[lie|from his wife]]. The best way to troll him or his fans is by saying his voice acting sucks ass and that he is way too old to be playing runescape and he should start caring more about his family. 
*[[13-year-old boy|'''Tehnoobshow''']] He used to make videos when he was around his 14's and as you might have guessed, they were boring as hell, his videos were about an [[unfunny]] dude called Bob that liked to call everyone noob [[Hypocrite|despite the fact he was one]], his nemesis was a man in a [[cock|chicken]] suit which points out his [[denial|dislike]] towards [[furries]]. His fans [[BAWWW]]ed when his youtube account got suspended, however the fags at [[Machinima]] saw his sorry ass and decided to make him their slave, since then he has been making even more boring videos like Bob irl (the same Bob from his older videos portrayed as a [[LOL WUT|stuffed monkey doll]] [[IRL]]), troll his fans by saying he is an unfunny douchebag and/or  that he haven't made a new video because he likes people sucking his tiny [[cock]] demanding for a new one.
*[[RAGE|'''NightmareRH''']] Some 20 year old who likes to show his passion for [[fail|player killing]] and is rich as fuck. Most of his videos consist of him going into the wilderness or pvp worlds, killing a lower level like once, and a black person of rangers and mages proceed to [[rape|pile]] the living shit out of him. Since he has a mic, he screams and curses like an angry woman into his mic, [[batshit insane|and records himself abusing his computer (and in one case, his door... with a chainsaw)]] and usually ends with him hurting himself. He also works at a black person and is in the army.
*[[trap|'''Defil3d''']] Started by making videos showing 'her' awesome [[penis|pk'ing skills]] and showing off the fact [[shit nobody cares about|'she' was the lowest level player with 99 defence]], she had a large bunch of [[fanboys]] who fapped whenever she logged in and [[H8r|haters]] who thought she was [[hax|autoing]] and tried to [[prove me wrong|prove]] she was a guy by posting equally unfunny videos, [[lady gaga|this is why nobody knows her/his true gender]]. Her story resembles the one of another [[boxxy|rage inducing girl]] we all know about. 
*[[Retarded|'''Angrynoob''']] A retarded kid whose videos consisted in talking like an angry asspie while getting owned by higher level monsters or annoying other players while they were [[fap|masturbating]]. [[Some argue]] this was the funniest one since it portrayed your average runescape player with 100% accuracy, he also might have been the inspiration of [[noob|tehnoobshow]] and probably better than him if he hadn't got owned by jagex.
*[[Fat|'''Skychi''']] He was some [[fat]] [[bastard]] who liked to make videos showing [[nerd rage|things which made him rage about runescape]], showing his [[fashion|1337 clothes and/or armor]] or [[shit nobody cares about|reviewing the newest runescape updates]], but the main reason he is mentioned here is because he was SO [[motherfucker|MOTHERFUCKING]] [[FAT]] and [[fugly|FUGLY]]. He once had a large amount of fans that would [[fellatio|suck his penis]] whenever they see him, but nowadays [[dying alone|nobody knows about him]].
*[[trying too hard|'''Sosolid2k''']] A guy who is paid by machinima to show he got the highest [[E-penis|hits]] in [[the game]] and owner of a [http://www.epicninja.com/ games portal] [[nobody cares|nobody cares about]]. He likes to pretend he is [[hardcore]] by adding [[heavy metal]] in his videos however this only makes his videos funnier since [[truth|nobody thinks showing your max hits in a shitty game while adding shitty music makes you look badass]]. Runescape players used to [[FAP]] like crazy when they watched his videos however jagex recently trolled him by releasing an update which multiplies all the hits by 10 [[owned|making the hits showed in his old videos look nooby]], [[gg]] Sosolid2k.
*'''[[Troll|Xemondo]]''' Yet another pathetic faggot, his main activities were [[trying too hard|writing rap songs]] about how much he [[basement dweller|LOVED R00NSKAIP]] and doing other [[retard|random]] shit. He was nobody until a very [[dark|bright]] day of halloween, he trolled [[nobody|all of his fans]] by faking his death as a cry for attention, when his subscribers knew about this they proceeded to become [[an hero]]. The day after, the troll sesion finished by giving the notice that he, in fact, was [[lulz|not dead]], he was [[Stick It In Her Pooper|raped in the ass]] for this [[serious business|atrocity]] and forced him to suspend his account.

===Runescape Machinima Competitions===
Because of [[Copyright]], [[Jagex]] started [[delete fucking everything|deleting these epic failures of videos]] [[for great justice]] but Runescape players started moaning (as usual) so they decided to allow them. However Jagex went a little too far with this and started [[promotions|giving away free lifetime memberships]] in video competitions along with [[Machinima]]. Everyone started posting their totally [[unfunny|funny]] and [[Lame|epic]] videos on youtube. 

The winner of the first competition was '''Excl''' with his [[trying too hard|smart humor]] and [[retarded|clever]] idea of showing himself [[time paradox|trying to come up with an idea for a video to win the competition]], his video was obviously way better than the others because it was made by a guy who; surprisingly enough, is [[divide by zero|around his 30's AND has a life!]] Plus take in mind [[99.9%]] of the videos were made by [[Nigahiga]] wannabe 13-year-old boys using unregistered hypercam 2, shitty sound recorders and both horrible voice acting and sense of humour. 

The winner of the second competition was way less funnier than the first one, it was made by some [[asspie]] kid named [[nintendo|'''gameboy1100''']] who thought it would be a cool idea to film himself singing a [[Rickroll|shitty song]] advertising some [[lazy town|boring town]]. The only lulz came from the kids raging about how this crap got selected as the winner, the funny part is that jagex chose it as ONE OUT OF TEN finalists and the [[irony|players themselves chose it as the winner]].
