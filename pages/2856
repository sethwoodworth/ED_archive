Fan sign

A '''fan sign''' is a device used to make sad, [[fat]], [[unpopular]] [[LiveJournal]] users feel popular and cool online.

Fan signs are created by [[friends]] of the LJ user, usually a [[16 year old girl]] with big [[tits]] holding a sign that says "$LJUSER IS SEXY" covering their [[rack]].

Fan signs are also used by [[goth]] [[SuicideGirls|alt models]] who claim their pictures are posted elsewhere by people dying to be them, or simply to attract unwelcome solicitors for the "real" owners of the images.

LJ user [[un_popular]] was one of many to request this of her "fans" and of the communities she moderated.

Other sites use fan signs, though with far less regularity. The hypocritical [[emo]] kids from [[Vampire Freaks]] love them some signs, so long as they're written in blood.
