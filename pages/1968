DMOZ
__NOTOC__
__NOEDITSECTION__
'''DMOZ.org''' (aka. Open Directory Project) is a corrupt web directory that controls the top three search engines [[Google]], [[MSN]], and [[Yahoo]]. Anything in the Open Directory, they consider important and these sites always spam to the top of search results. Anything not in DMOZ, they consider lower than the spammy viagra sites.

===How to get into DMOZ===
Editors will only list their own sites or friends' sites and they list them thirty times while removing their competitors' legitimate sites.  Editors of course can't have the category entirely consist of their own [[google|adsense]] farms, so they will pad it out with dead links and sites not updated since 1997.

To get into DMOZ, don't immediately submit your site to DMOZ.  First, find an editor in the category you want.  Then [[PayPal]] them some money.  Don't put it in writing overtly that it's a bribe to get into DMOZ, just let them know what website it's for and offer subtle hints.  Only after sending the bribe do you submit your site to DMOZ in the editor's category.

For example, activestate.com due to heavy bribing of DMOZ meta-editors, has their site listed on DMOZ [http://search.dmoz.org/cgi-bin/search?search=activestate 23 times!]

===How much should one bribe?===
It's hard to tell how much money it was.  Back in 2004 it was $250, but inflation has sure gone up!  To quote [http://www.shoemoney.com/2007/08/26/dmoz-extortion/ Jeremy Schoemaker]:

A while back I got a email from a guy claiming to be a DMOZ editor saying that I had to pay him $5,000.00 or he would have my site: shoemoney.com removed from the dmoz.

I thought nothing of it…. then today I got a email from him saying it was removed and I might want to rethink not paying him. I thought I would check just for grins. 

It was removed… WOW

dmoz… corrupt… no…..

I never thought I would say this but I don't even care anymore. I am stunned Google still uses this as there business directory as its the most corrupt "editorial" system EVER and especially since now they are trying to talk about paid links and crap…

After reading that blog entry, an unrelated DMOZ editor [http://yoast.com/the-dmoz-mob-strikes-again/ Joost] asked DMOZ about it.  36 hours later, DMOZ [[Perma-ban|permabanned]] Joost as an editor without even a notice.

Another quote as a reply to Joost's blog entry:
{{quote3|
Hell, I'm an editor for DMOZ and was editing 4 categories. Now I'm editing only 3 ...

One day some webmaster wanted to get his site listed which i had to deny. His site was a banner farm and I mailed him to tell him that he shouldn't use that many ads. He replied and offered me $500 for a listing. I rejected that offer ..

Something about 3 hours later a Meta removed me from the category and that banner farm site was suddenly listed. 

DMOZ is corrupt :/

===Why doesn't one just sign up or volunteer to be an editor?===
Be my guest. According to their site:

"Signing up is easy: choose a topic you know something about and join. Editing categories is a snap. We have a comprehensive set of tools for adding, deleting, and updating links in seconds. For just a few minutes of your time you can help make the Web a better place, and be recognized as an expert on your chosen topic."

But that's all bullshit.

Even if you hold multiple doctoral degrees in a topic and apply ten times each to categories with no editor in it, they will never even look at your application, much less approve it.

Why? Because the DMOZ is corrupt. They know they have power and they don't want to relinquish it to people like you.

===What else can one do as an editor?===

Editors change the URLs of the links to domains frequently to make sure they don't rank well. One week it will be www.domain.com the next will be domain.com the next will have a "/" after it, sometimes they will even direct it to www.domain.com/index.html. Because both the age of a link and the exact link location are important to Google, changing this information will hurt the ranking of the listing.  Another good technique is to bounce your competitor's DMOZ listing around from category to category and strip all the keywords from it.

Google takes the description from the DMOZ instead of from the website for the write-up that appears with the search results.  So if your competitor's site is for for business professionals or children, rewrite the DMOZ description so it's about scat porn.

Most importantly, you decide which sites get in to the directory. When you are an editor of a category in the DMOZ, you can edit the titles and descriptions to be as favorable or unfavorable as you like. You can give any listings in the category bland descriptions with no keywords or spruce it up for your listings or your friends listings. Right now, if you visit some of the categories, you can play the "spot the good listing game." It's easy to tell who is an editor or friends with an editor.

Quote from an editor [http://www.corruptdmozeditor.com/2004/12/sabotaging-competitors-dmoz-listing.html]:

My arch competitor had a dupe content subdomain that they set up for traffic overflow and I changed their dmoz listing to the subdomain with duplicate content and it slaughtered their rankings for a couple of months.

===Can one make money as a DMOZ editor?===
People understand that the DMOZ is corrupt and will often attempt to bribe you. When you are with a corporate client, you can easily charge [[over 9000|$9,001]] or more for a DMOZ listing. It is both that important and extremely difficult to get listed.

If you do SEO or web marketing for a living and can't get your client into the DMOZ, you are a failure. If, however, you become an editor in the DMOZ, you will have access to the DMOZ message boards and will be able to network with all the other editors. When these editors are your friends, they'll be happy put your clients sites in the directory. Don't forget, it's much easier to switch categories or take on additional categories once you are "on the inside."

All people who are DMOZ editors don't just have one account, they have [[sock puppet|many]].
