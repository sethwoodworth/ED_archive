Nyx's Sister (3:09:18 AM): hey you. yeah you. if you block me, you're a pussy
t3h-dyl4n (3:09:34 AM): A pussy? Lol.
t3h-dyl4n (3:09:43 AM): Go ahead, lay it on me.
Nyx's Sister (3:09:54 AM): how bout you leave my sister alone. dont be fucking stupid. i watch her draw her art, so leave her alone
t3h-dyl4n (3:10:18 AM): Uh oh.  Somebody called the waaaahmbulance on me.
Nyx's Sister (3:10:35 AM): she doesnt "trace" and if you're that much of a fuckhead to go to stupid lengths to tell her she traces, then i feel sorry for you
Nyx's Sister (3:10:39 AM): grow up
Nyx's Sister (3:10:44 AM): you're so childish.
t3h-dyl4n (3:10:46 AM): Let me show you something.
Nyx's Sister (3:10:57 AM): no
Nyx's Sister (3:10:59 AM): cause idc
Nyx's Sister (3:11:03 AM): i see her draw it
t3h-dyl4n (3:11:05 AM): So you don't care about hard evidence?
Nyx's Sister (3:11:10 AM): and you're fucking stupid
t3h-dyl4n (3:11:10 AM): http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v188/horrorfetish/trace2-1.png
t3h-dyl4n (3:11:15 AM): http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v188/horrorfetish/trace1.png
t3h-dyl4n (3:11:19 AM): Hard.  Evidence.
t3h-dyl4n (3:11:31 AM): Sorry, you may love your sister, but I'm not obligated to stand up for her.
Nyx's Sister (3:11:45 AM): well i am
Nyx's Sister (3:11:49 AM): because i see her draw it
t3h-dyl4n (3:12:04 AM): I have a feeling you're not sitting on her shoulder constantly watching her draw.
Nyx's Sister (3:12:10 AM): and people who accuse people of shit when its not true need to stfu and mind their own damn business
t3h-dyl4n (3:12:15 AM): Lol.
Nyx's Sister (3:12:17 AM): actually, im really close with her
Nyx's Sister (3:12:22 AM): so yeah, i see her draw
t3h-dyl4n (3:12:27 AM): I understand.  I'm really close with my sister, too.
Nyx's Sister (3:12:30 AM): she even has a mini drawing of me
t3h-dyl4n (3:12:33 AM): But if she was tracing, I'd have something to say about it.
Nyx's Sister (3:12:57 AM): so many people but the shit out of her and says she traces. i swear to god she doesnt trace. god strike me dead. 
t3h-dyl4n (3:12:57 AM): Instead of huffing and puffing and trying to act all threatening to people who are trying to inform the art community that your little baby sister is, in fact, a fucking fraud.
Nyx's Sister (3:13:10 AM): oh wait, im alive
t3h-dyl4n (3:13:17 AM): Oh shit.  I guess that means there's no god.
Nyx's Sister (3:13:18 AM): leave her alone. seriously
t3h-dyl4n (3:13:19 AM): Lmao.
t3h-dyl4n (3:13:31 AM): Her tracing is in the hands of the deviantart staff to judge now.
t3h-dyl4n (3:13:44 AM): They have her overlays to look at and detemine the course of action on their own.
t3h-dyl4n (3:13:51 AM): I have no influence over what they do anymore.
Nyx's Sister (3:14:16 AM): omg. seriously. you're so fucking stupid. your art should be deleted.
Nyx's Sister (3:14:22 AM): she DOESNT trace
Nyx's Sister (3:14:25 AM): this pisses me off
t3h-dyl4n (3:14:27 AM): Except I didn't do anything wrong.
Nyx's Sister (3:14:36 AM): yeah, you did
Nyx's Sister (3:14:49 AM): you got her fucking number and told her she was a fraud
t3h-dyl4n (3:14:51 AM): By standing up for my best friend, who is getting ripped off and traced by your sister?
t3h-dyl4n (3:14:54 AM): I didn't get her number.
t3h-dyl4n (3:15:00 AM): She has AIM set up on her phone.
t3h-dyl4n (3:15:12 AM): I sent her an IM through AIM and it forwarded to her phone.
Nyx's Sister (3:15:19 AM): i couldnt give a shit about your best friend, considering my sister hasnt done shit
Nyx's Sister (3:15:30 AM): so just seriously leave her alone
t3h-dyl4n (3:15:33 AM): You have a bit of a bias, with no evidence to prove it.
Nyx's Sister (3:15:37 AM): dont "im" her via phone
Nyx's Sister (3:15:45 AM): my own eyes are evidence
t3h-dyl4n (3:15:47 AM): I blocked her, lol.  I have no desire to continue talking with her.
t3h-dyl4n (3:15:58 AM): "My own eyes" doesn't hold up in court, and it won't hold up here.
Nyx's Sister (3:16:28 AM): i dont see your evidence. just because you and your "bestfriend" make shitty art doesnt mean anything to me
t3h-dyl4n (3:16:33 AM): Uh.
Nyx's Sister (3:16:35 AM): and yeah, im going to be a bitxh
Nyx's Sister (3:16:38 AM): bitch*
t3h-dyl4n (3:16:38 AM): Did you not just see those links I sent you?
Nyx's Sister (3:16:46 AM): because im pissed and you're stupid
Nyx's Sister (3:16:50 AM): and yeah, shitty
t3h-dyl4n (3:17:08 AM): So, you are faced with hard evidence and deny it still, and you're calling ME stupid?
Nyx's Sister (3:17:12 AM): yup
t3h-dyl4n (3:17:17 AM): Well, you have fun with that.
Nyx's Sister (3:17:19 AM): because you accuse people
t3h-dyl4n (3:17:24 AM): With... proof.
Nyx's Sister (3:17:26 AM): so stfu and mind your own business
t3h-dyl4n (3:17:26 AM): Hello
Nyx's Sister (3:17:28 AM): im done her
t3h-dyl4n (3:17:30 AM): Is there something you're not getting?
Nyx's Sister (3:17:31 AM): goodbye
t3h-dyl4n (3:17:37 AM): I hope your sister gets banned. :)
Nyx's Sister (3:17:45 AM): i hope you burn in hell

Nyx's sister in response to finding this article.
<pre>
Nyx's Sister (10:54:59 PM): are you seriously that pathetic that you're making an encyclopedia
Nyx's Sister (10:55:30 PM): how about you stop the waa fest and just leave us alone. seriously, you already accused, how about you just leave us alone
Nyx's Sister (10:55:33 PM): this is so stupid
t3h-dyl4n (10:56:00 PM): Things could have gone differently if she'd just admitted it. :)
Nyx's Sister (10:56:44 PM): omg. seriously. for one, i'm not ignorant. for two, are you making fun of my dead aunt? thats rude. for three, you guys are realllllly dramatic
t3h-dyl4n (10:56:55 PM): Welcome to the Internet.
Nyx's Sister (10:57:08 PM): welcome to you're a dumbass.
t3h-dyl4n (10:57:33 PM): Wow, nice one.
t3h-dyl4n (10:57:38 PM): Right through the heart.
t3h-dyl4n (10:57:53 PM): Is there some Third Grade Insult Generator online that I don't know about?
Nyx's Sister (10:57:55 PM): this is so fucking stupid ! you guys got what you wanted, so why dont you stop being big babies
t3h-dyl4n (10:58:03 PM): We didn't get anything, actually.
t3h-dyl4n (10:58:21 PM): Nyx has admitted absolutely no guilt, and has not apologized for being an uppity moron to anyone.
t3h-dyl4n (10:58:26 PM): Regardless, it's too late for that now.
t3h-dyl4n (10:58:56 PM): And I love that she refuses to come and talk to me herself.  She has to sic her sister on me.
t3h-dyl4n (10:59:18 PM): Though she's already made it clear that she's incapable of holding her own in an argument.
Nyx's Sister (10:59:19 PM): so because she wont apologize for something she didnt do, you're going to make obnoxious accusations and post them via encyclopedia. and btw, i was the one who asked for your sn, it was my choice
t3h-dyl4n (10:59:49 PM): There's too much evidence, and the only people that believe you are willfully ignorant.
Nyx's Sister (11:00:11 PM): we can say the same about your side
t3h-dyl4n (11:00:38 PM): Except we have cited sources, made overlays, asked for inbiased opinions, and drawn nearly scientific conclusions from the information that we have.
Nyx's Sister (11:00:55 PM): so now you're a scientist? wow, i'm impressed
t3h-dyl4n (11:01:09 PM): Are you really that much of a simpleton?
Nyx's Sister (11:01:17 PM): simpleton? no
Nyx's Sister (11:01:19 PM): you? yes
t3h-dyl4n (11:01:22 PM): As a matter of fact, my area of study IS science, if you're so interested.
t3h-dyl4n (11:01:26 PM): You're me?
Nyx's Sister (11:01:45 PM): you gonna post this on the web too? are you that pathetic, that you need my IMs to help your pity fest of "Stolen art" ?
Nyx's Sister (11:01:56 PM): you= simpleton
Nyx's Sister (11:01:57 PM): wow
t3h-dyl4n (11:02:03 PM): Nice chunky ED articles are the best, after all.
t3h-dyl4n (11:02:32 PM): "simpleton? no. you? yes."  There's a correlation that you're missing.  I'm completely unsurprised.
Nyx's Sister (11:02:43 PM): ...
Nyx's Sister (11:02:53 PM): do you really think you're that smart?
t3h-dyl4n (11:02:58 PM): Actually, yes.
t3h-dyl4n (11:03:03 PM): And you're making me feel even smarter. :D
Nyx's Sister (11:03:07 PM): because honestly, i'm kinda laughing at this, really hard, because its pathetic
t3h-dyl4n (11:03:22 PM): If you thought it was so pathetic, why would you waste your time bitching at me about it, really?
t3h-dyl4n (11:03:31 PM): If you claim not to CARE.
t3h-dyl4n (11:03:32 PM): Then fuck off.
t3h-dyl4n (11:03:37 PM): And let the internet take its course.
Nyx's Sister (11:03:51 PM): no, i care that you're posting shit about ME on the internet
t3h-dyl4n (11:04:02 PM): Perhaps you shouldn't be joining fights, then.
t3h-dyl4n (11:04:18 PM): At least I had the decency not to post your screen name.
t3h-dyl4n (11:04:19 PM): Lol.
t3h-dyl4n (11:04:24 PM): Though that would have been hilarious.
Nyx's Sister (11:04:36 PM): how?
t3h-dyl4n (11:05:00 PM): Hmm.  Screen name of a bumbling idiot on a website dedicated to trolling bumbling idiots.  I wonder why that would entertain me.
Nyx's Sister (11:05:14 PM): -_- to bad im never on here anyways
t3h-dyl4n (11:05:25 PM): That's fine.  Like I said, I didn't post your SN.
t3h-dyl4n (11:05:31 PM): But you need to suck it the fuck up.
Nyx's Sister (11:05:42 PM): you're telling me I need to? LMFAO
Nyx's Sister (11:06:23 PM): you guys are the ones being babies enough to post an encyclopedia
Nyx's Sister (11:06:24 PM): not me
t3h-dyl4n (11:06:32 PM): For your information, LHF ignored your sister's copying until she started attacking her friends.
t3h-dyl4n (11:06:45 PM): I'm sure everyone who reads those comments if going to think WE were the immature ones.
Nyx's Sister (11:07:07 PM): how about, you take my IMs and the "ignorant" picture of me down
Nyx's Sister (11:07:13 PM): and i'll mind my own business
t3h-dyl4n (11:07:27 PM): Too bad, so sad, sweetheart.  You made your choice.
Nyx's Sister (11:07:43 PM): i made mine? you guys are the one who posted that stupid website
Nyx's Sister (11:07:50 PM): and dont call me sweetheart
t3h-dyl4n (11:07:53 PM): You are the one that decided to IM me.
Nyx's Sister (11:08:07 PM): i hope you know how stupid you look right now
t3h-dyl4n (11:08:28 PM): You keep using this word.  I do not think it means what you think it means.
Nyx's Sister (11:08:41 PM): idc what you think it means
Nyx's Sister (11:08:47 PM): your opinion means shit to me
t3h-dyl4n (11:08:59 PM): The fact of the matter is, me being RIGHT and you being BUTTHURT does not make me STUPID.
Nyx's Sister (11:09:06 PM): buthurt?
Nyx's Sister (11:09:08 PM): LMFAO
Nyx's Sister (11:09:10 PM): AHAHA
t3h-dyl4n (11:09:16 PM): Then why would you want me to remove you from the page, if my opinion means nothing?
Nyx's Sister (11:09:18 PM): why am i even wasting my time?
t3h-dyl4n (11:09:26 PM): I don't know.  You're not going to get anything out of this.
Nyx's Sister (11:09:36 PM): because i dont think my personal business should be in a website
t3h-dyl4n (11:09:43 PM): You made it my business. :)
Nyx's Sister (11:09:49 PM): no, not really
t3h-dyl4n (11:09:55 PM): I didn't post any personal information of yours, anyway.
Nyx's Sister (11:10:18 PM): i guess in your case ignorance is bliss. have a nice day
t3h-dyl4n (11:10:35 PM): Yeah, you have fun there, little girl.
Nyx's Sister (11:10:47 PM): oh i will
t3h-dyl4n (11:10:52 PM): Kay.  See you! :)
Nyx's Sister (11:10:55 PM): not
t3h-dyl4n (11:11:07 PM): Ohh, I've been had by a third grader.
t3h-dyl4n (11:11:14 PM): YOU GOT ME.
t3h-dyl4n (11:11:16 PM): TEEHEE
