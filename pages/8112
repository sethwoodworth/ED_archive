That's not funny, my brother died that way

[[Image:BAWWWWWWWWWWWWW.jpg|thumb|right|A Summary of the excuse]]

'''"That's not funny my brother died that way"''' is a satirical catch-all way to shut somebody down. It is descended from [[old]] pull-back jokes such as: "That's not funny! My grandfather died in Auschwitz!" "Oh god, I'm so sorry!" "Yeah, he fell off the guard tower." 

Once it found its way to /[[b/]], all the [[Shit nobody cares about|unnecessary]] stuff such as setup and punchline were removed and it was retooled for [[chan]] humour which consists of simply saying the same thing over and over. In other words, it was neatly transformed from an ill-advised and decades-old joke into... well, the above basically, but [[Fail|without the joke]].

It's mostly used [[IRL]] by [[Moralfags]] and [[BAWWW|bawwwfags]] to guilt people into apologizing when they make fun of [[Columbine|school shootings]]. Someone will say 'I thought [[Virginia Tech Massacre|Virginia Tech]] was fucking hilarious' to which someone will respond; 'THAT'S NOT FUNNY. MY BROTHER DIED THAT WAY' to which the [[troll]] will receive his much deserved [[lulz]].

{{Quote|[[Verbose Thread|I must express my deep dismay and shock at your utter disregard for human feelings and general insensitivity. You see, good sir, my kin has passed away in a similar manner. And despite the opposing parties chortles and giggles, it is most certainly not humorous.]]}}

{{Quote|LOL [[AWESOME]]}}

{{Quote|I'm sorry your brother died, that's really quite sad. [[Lioncash|:<]]}}

== How to Fail ==

[[Image:thatsnotfunny.png|thumb|Man, that's rough. My brother died doing a Hustler Halloween Special dressed up as a monster too. :[]]
Typically when used, it is an easy excuse to expose as fail. For example:

'''Bill''': Hey Chet, did you hear about Mandy getting eaten alive by that pack of wild dogs? HILARIOUS, [[amirite]]???

'''Chet''': Bill, that's not funny, my brother died that way.

'''Bill''': ...what are you talking about, dude? I AM your brother. I'm not dead, retard.

== How to Properly Troll ==

Step 1: Find an [[MySpace|obscure site]] where there seems to be a lot of [[moralfaggotry]] and whining.

Step 2: Look for [[butthurt]] users and post something regarding your dead brother in response to them.

Step 3: (OPTIONAL) Elaborate ''ad naus[[Ã¦]]<nowiki>um</nowiki>'' and continue to play the role so long as [[the lulz]] keep rolling in.
