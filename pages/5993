Omorashi-Fan
[[Image:Omoold.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Her old dA page]]
Omorashi-Fan is a [[pedophile|shotacon]] [[imaginary|artist]] who, like many [[Deviantart|Deviantartlets]], believes [[tracing]] is awwwright, at least until she gets caught doing it.  Then it's time to deny, deny, deny.

== Her art ==
[[Image:Omoadmits.jpg|150px|thumb|left|LOL WUT?]]Omorashi has not drawn a single piece of original art work.  Her method of choice is to hang out on shotakon.org and find a picture of a little boy who is peeing/looks like he could be peeing/has peed his pants, then trace it.  She seems to have an unhealthy fascination with piss and what happens to it.

== Banned from y!gallery ==
[[Image:Lolbanned.JPG|150px|thumb|left|y!Gallery mods [[ban|rape]] hard.]] [[emo|Poor, poor Omorashi]]. DevianTART won't let her post her pee pictures, and y!gallery won't let her post them because they are traced.  Also they seem to think she is fifteen.  Posting pictures of shota is fine, but apparently you must be at least [[pedobear|eighteen]] to do it.

== [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]] ==
[[Image:Omohided.jpg|150px|thumb|left|She's [[Quitting IRC forever|quitting EVERYTHING forevar]].]]
Shortly after posting a BAWWWWWWWWWWWW entry in her dA journal about the y!gallery [[ban|banning]] and how her [[shit no one cares about|art wasn't accepted anywhere]] she decided to leave Deviant art forever and take it elsewhere.  Following standard Tartlet procedure, she went into a comment hiding frenzy, cleared out her entire gallery, and [[an hero|slit her wrists]].  At least that's the general gist of it.
