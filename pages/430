Stephanie Michelle Brown, a.k.a. "BrOwNiE" (1989-2007), was a [[16_year_old_girl|17 year old girl]] from Wyandotte, Michigan who was the first female to become [[an hero]] by overdosing on [[heroin]]. She gained web notoriety when her friends posted numerous, nauseatingly shitty [[MySpace]] memorial profiles and subsequently gave birth to a new [[meme]], "An Heroine".

== How the bitch died ==
[[Last Thursday]], An Heroine lied about her age to dance as a [[stripper]], got [[drunk]] and went [[lesbian]] with a fellow [[whore]] by the name of Jamie Lynn Adkins of Lincoln Park, who can be seen [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/the_real_jamie_lynn_adkins/ here]. Then, they both got high off [[cocaine]], [[ecstasy]] and [[drugs|blunts]] (combined street value: [[over 9000]]), fucked two [[nigra|nigras]] (one of whom is totally [[Paris_Hilton|going to jail]] for this [[shit]]) then finally ODed whilst finishing off the cocaine. [http://alldownriver.com/forum/showthread.php?t=12921 This is all fact]. Kids these days just can't handle their coke. Annoyingly, this means she didn't actually die from ODing on heroin as first believed. However, her actual death is far more [[LULZ|LULZy]], so fuck it.

Thing is, while she was from [[hell|Wyandotte]], MI, she danced and did all manner of [[Slut|slutty]] things in [[Linkin Park|Lincoln Park]], then died in a motel in Melvindale, MI. [[LOL]].

== Origins ==

The MySpace profile was originally posted on [[420chan]], where it didn't receive much attention until [[Anonymous]] brought it to 4chan's [[/b/]]. The result was a hellstorm of instant [[lulz]] which quickly brought a raid on her MySpace blogs, as well as attacks upon the majority of her friends who had memorial profiles.

== Nickname ==
[[Image:browntar.jpg|right|thumb| That's not brownies! ]]
Contrary to popular belief, her nickname "Brownie" did not come from her last name, but instead her love of brown tar heroin. When not broken up into a powder, this variety of heroin resembles a [[Delicious Cake|hearty chocolate brownie]]. It is reported that (actual) brownies were also one of her favorite foods, which she would throw up while riding the brown dragon.

==  Self Denial == 

In one of her nonsensical blog entries, [[Whore|she]] outwardly denies responsibility for her lying, scheming, drug-fueled, whorish actions, and then proclaims that she is clean and sober:

:''"Fuck man, im never gunna live this shit down am I?''
:''Do a little drugs,''
:''Fuck a few guys,''
:''And everything you say is a lie,''
:''[[Truth|Youre a stupid drugged up bitch who doesnt know anything]].''
:''[[Irony|WELL WORLD I AM FUCKING CLEAN NOW AND HAVE BEEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME]] SO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET OVER ME, I AM SO OVER YOU!''
:''xoxo <3 Stephanie"''

== Retaliation ==

In retaliation to the blog raids, a number of Stephanie's friends came back screaming to high hell about how wrong and bad everyone was. Most of the messages consisted of angry ranting tripe by people who were pissed that they couldn't fuck their dope slut anymore. Anonymous replied in kind, stating the [[truth]] that her own friends were the ones who had killed her through their ignorance and indifference in regard to her obvious cries for help. Of course, nobody really cared about the junkie whore to start with, but it's still their fault.

One of her friends, "Sofonda," found her way to the /b/ post and started demanding that everyone show their face. Of course this was met with only more shoops, and hilarity ensued. Soon after, it was uncovered that Sofonda was the person who had sold her the heroin that she ODed on, and the reason she was attempting to piss in the ocean of piss was because of her own guilt.

Some have speculated that the reason why she overdosed wasn't related to her wanton lust for unprotected sex, but because of the low quality of the lunch menu at her school, where she couldn't get a [[fried_chicken| decent meal]].

==<strike>Her friends</strike> Bitches don't know she became an hero==
They still talk to the bitch like she's alive. 

===MySpace lulz===
Random comment from her MySpace page: 

{{Quote|i talked too you today and i asked you too give me a sign and you made the song skip so thanx i know you heard me. just chill honey|jtweezy79}}

The whore is in [[hell]]. There is no possible way that she could make a song skip while being raped by demons' spiky cocks. Secondly, a song skipping is hardly a sign. This goes to show how stupid her friends are, which in turn shows how stupid she was. The world is better off.
[[Image:HateMailfromAFriendofBrownie.jpg|thumb|MySpace hate in [[ALL CAPS|CAPS LOCK OF DOOM]]]]
Another idiot friend, who happens to be a bisexual fat bitch, [http://www.myspace.com/peepinsam has a MySpace page] that she uses to send hatemail as she didn't get to bang Brownie before she died.

===[[faggot|Boyfriend]]===
In retaliation to the appearance of new Brownie MySpaces, a dickless assbag who still defends his stripping, [[hobo|coke-snorting]] drug addict of a [[whore|prostituting]] rotting corpse that was his junkie girlfriend has [[A_challenger_appears|appeared]], sending unparagraphed hate-PMs to [[EDiots]] and [[/b/]]tards on MySpace. Strangely, he seems to be okay with the fact that she was double-stuffed raw in the ass by two big black person dudes while a chick fisted her mouth on the night she died. He says he will [[bullshit|hunt us down and kill all of us]].  Epic [[lulz]] from an [[internets]] [[Internet Tough Guy|tard]] who has an [[Irish|amazingly big red nose]].

In case anyone would like to write to her grieving [[virgin|boyfriend]] (for the [[lulz|lulz]] of course), he would love to hear about what you think of the matter at this [http://www.myspace.com/splinx06 private MySpace account], or at this
[http://www.myspace.com/thedrinkerofmartinis not-so private MySpace] (which also sends pro-Brownie propaganda). Might not be the same guy, but he's probably just as pissed that he didn't get to nail her before she kicked the bucket as the other.

Too bad his brain isn't as large as his nose, otherwise he might not have made the mistake of posting his telephone number on the internets:  

724-973-6719

The [[attention whore]] is obviously just looking for new friends. Life must be tough when Jew

==Graduation==
During the commencements that she couldn't wait long enough to go to, her brother had to accept her [[Worthless|diploma]]. That's right. Dead people can graduate too. They also changed the class motto from ''Hakuna Matata'' to ''Live and Let Live'' (moar liek ''Live and Let Die'', [[amirite]])?

==Heroin Cabaret==
Brownie's death was copied from [http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2828044/25/My_Immortal chapter 25] of ''[[My Immortal]]'', in which [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|Draco took out a heroin cabaret and spiked it, giving it to Ebony to spork]].

== Conviction of the Drug Dealer ==
[[nigra|Deleon Alexander II]] from [[Linkin park|Lincoln Park]], who gave the slut her drugs and [[Buttsecks|butt fucked]] her, was sentenced on October 24th. His [[Phoenix Wright|lawyer]] said, "The defense has said Alexander never intended for anyone to die and claimed Brown requested and ingested the drugs herself." This [[nigra|man]] must have been sent by God.
