Kail
[[Image:Kail.jpg|thumb|Kail, looking extremely [[Gay| fly]].]]Kail is a [[shit]] musician from [[Goatse| New Jersey]] who mixes [[Bullshit| Comedy]] with [[Emo| Folk Rock]], though usually most of the time he just rips off [[Furry|Sonic]] music and sings over it. Since cutting his hair and shaving his beard, there is nothing left about him that is remotely interesting.  He's also started a "nu-metal food blog" called [http://aloneibake.blogspot.com Alone I Bake] which he no longer posts on. Most recently, he's started a new website called [http://www.muscletower.com/ MUSCLETOWER] which hosts not only his shitty music, but his equally shitty podcast [http://www.destroyallslackers.com/ Destroy All Slackers].

==Music==
Kail's first album [[Gay| Fun and Fancy Free]] is the worst shit to ever [[Tubgirl|storm]] the [[internets]]. He took a couple [[Sonic]] songs and sung over them and posted them on MySpace and people shat themselves wild. What's even [[gay]]er is that the album only has like 4 songs and the rest are [[Uncyclopedia|unfunny]] prank calls. Links on his MySpace say you can download Fun and Fancy Free for free, but we know this is lies because when one clicks upon [[penis| the mighty link]], they're directed to nothing.
He thinks he's [[lies| cool]] because he dresses and acts like he's a metal head by wearing [[Dragonforce|Dimmu Borgir]] shirts at shows and by swinging his [[Lion|long, flowing mane]] around, but really his music is like a dump Bob Dylan took with lyrics Tenacious D shat out.
Apparently according to his [[ass| blog]] on MySpace, he's recording a full length album called "[[Cock|Rock]] and Rule" which he will be selling for cash monies so that he can feed his insatiable lust for [[Hookers and blow]].

==Tails is Hot==
A lovely ballad Kail wrote about his love for an [[furry| 8 year old fictional fox]] from the Sonic the Hedgehog series. [[Pedobear| Kail]] claims the story is from Sonic's point of view, but we really know it's from his own. The song tells the story about [[Kail| Sonic]] sucking on Tails's cock, enjoying his proverbial "liquid goo," and then asking Tails if he would like to watch a movie with him after the job is done. It is Kail's most famous song, with fangirls all over the world shitting themselves over it. If it was played on the radio, Kail would be arrested for [[lol| pedophilia]], but since it's on the internets, it's become a phenomenon.

==MySpace==
He has [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|6,000]] [[MySpace]] friends that [[Lies| suddenly appeared]] over a period of 6 months. Most of his fans are hot ass teenage girls with big titties, but for some reason he looks passed that (he must have strong eyes, amirite?) and fucks them with his mighty man [[harbl]].

==Humor Songs==

Like Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails before him, Kail decided to be a [[gay]] [[Tautology|faggot]] and release his album for free, rather than sell it. It came out on April 22, 2008 for free from his website, which there's a link to below. It was made available in a downloadable .zip, but you can download each shitty song individually.

Since he's a lazy asshole, he took clips from the [[Gay|KISS]] movie ''KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park'' and made it into a music video.

==MUSCLETOWER Era==
[[Image:Tucson.jpg|thumb|The next [[Jared Lee Loughner]].]]After a few years of no activity, Kail popped up mysteriously on [http://www.twitter.com/ClashEX Twitter] in 2009. As of 2011, he's still posting [[shit nobody cares about]] and thinking he's worth a damn. In late 2010, his website MUSCLETOWER appeared on the internet, only hosting one thing: his new podcast. Now he's brought along his high-school friend Andrew Teller to talk about being [[Gay|faggots]] and loving Sonic the Hedgehog. The show seems to be sponsored by Adam and Eve, the adult entertainment company, meaning these gays are being paid to talk about shitting and cumming.
