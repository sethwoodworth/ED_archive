Explosm
[[Image:Cyanide.jpg|thumb|This is the comic for which the series is named.]]

'''Explosm''' is a website that features a daily [[webcomic]] named ''Cyanide & Happiness''. The comic is the epitome of [[lie|unfunny]]. All of the characters look the same. The comic causes much [[butthurt]] across the [[series of tubes|internet]], but if you complain about it on the forums, you'll be ignored.

[[Tl;dr|''Cyanide & Happiness'' began when sixteen-year-old Kris Wilson was at home suffering from Streptococcal sore throat. To entertain himself, he drew comics on paper and scanned them to his computer. Feeling unnecessarily proud of his creations, he built a website called Comicazi. Later, he showcased his comics on StickSuicide's forum. The webmasters of this forum saw potential in his comics and sucked his dick to the point that they had to create a new website, Explosm.]]

==The Writers==
*'''Kris Wilson''' - The [[retard|brains]] behind C&H.
*'''Robert DenBleyker''' - One of the original administrators of StickSuicide. He has submitted, by far, the most comics.
*'''Matthew Melvin''' - One of the original administrators of StickSuicide. He has submitted the least comics. His characters look like skinny potatoes with arms and legs. His women look just like his men, except with ponytails. His comics are, by far, the least original.  He is known for his "[[AIDS]] jokes." His most recent failure was to create his own shitty website, [http://www.robotswithfeelings.com/ Robots with Feelings]. It sucks.
*'''David McElfatrick''' - One of the original administrators of StickSuicide. His characters look like droopier versions of Kris'. Dave's specialty is shitty puns.

==Themes==

[[Image:Cannibis.PNG|thumb|<s>Ironically, this is how the writers of C&H get their ideas.</s> '''Fuck that, it just means that none of the little cunts has ever had anything stronger than a coffee''' No, because the author was and got bored while drawing.]]

==Characters==
Most of the characters look exactly the same, but there are some recurring characters.
*'''Seizure Man''' - One of the numerous superheroes in C&H. He enters epileptic seizures constantly.
*'''The Purple-Shirted Eye Stabber''' - The name pretty much explains it all. He wears a purple shirt and [[Modern Warfare 2|stabs people in the eye]].
*'''Super-Jerk''' - Another superhero. He uses his super powers to piss people off.
*'''Trelaf The Wise''' - He sits on his throne all day and gives people advice.
*'''Obese Maurice''' - A fat fucking douchebag who complains about being discriminated against. See [[Chismah]].
*'''Charles''' - Some douchebag who treats his girlfriend like shit.
*'''Jesus''' - Self-explanatory. He is often portrayed as a zombie for Easter.
*'''Creepy Seagull Grandpa''' - Simply turns into a seagull and flys off. He looks like a typical video game enemy and whomever thought him up should really consider becoming [[an hero]]. 
*'''Inventor''' - [[Sick fuck|Some crackpot scientist who built a robot, tried to fuck it and got electrocuted.  He has since done the same to a snowman and a rug, and for some reason hasn't died yet.]]

==Fans==

[[Image:Pruane2forever.jpg|thumb|Typical C&H reader.]]

Every webcomic, no matter how unfunny or unoriginal, has its fans (with the exception of ''[[Cheddar-Cheesia|The Homeschool Schoolers]]'').

''Cyanide & Happiness'' is enjoyed by 90% of all [[newfag|newfags]] and [[13-year-old boys]]. It is not uncommon to see comic strips in people's signatures on internet forums. If you frequent an internet forum and discover a ''Cyanide & Happiness'' comic strip in someone's signature, proceed to flaming the living shit out of that person until either you've been [[b&|permabanned]] or the comic strip has been [[Baleet|removed]] from the signature.

''Cyanide & Happiness'' comic strips sometimes appear in [[/b/]] if the comic was particularly offensive; such as the comic featuring a man [[child abuse|beating his son to a bloody pulp]].
