Epin
[[Image:Successful troll2.jpg|thumb|EPIN troll is epin.]]


'''Epin''' is a short term for '''Ep'''ic W'''in''', which was created on the sixth of June 2009 by a bunch of newfags spamming pictures of girls, putting "she EPIN /b/" in the comment box. Several moments later, due to [[copypasta|copypasting]] it was all around /b/, with newfags and trolls annoying the living hell out of of [[lie|proper]] users of the [[b/|Random]] board (as well as any other users who just don't have enough brains to ignore it). This is the prime example of a forced meme made by [[unfunny]] [[newfags]] and the only appropriate response is "SAGE GOES IN ALL FIELDS".
