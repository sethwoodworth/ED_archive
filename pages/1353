{{needsmoar|about Carson Daly E-drama and Raids}}

'''Carson Daly''' was the host of [[MTV]]'s only music video show, ''Total Request Live'', during the late 90's. At the amazing peak of his [[fail|awesomeness]], his digitally assembled radio program, ''Carson Daily Most Requested'', gave FCC local broadcast requirements the finger by becoming the first local radio show to broadcast in [[over 9000]] markets simultaneously. 

==Last Call with Carson Daly==
After several years of unstoppable success, Carson joined NBC in 2002 to host a late night talk show, ''Last Call with Carson Daly'', and unwittingly entered the 4th circle of [[hell]]. To the surprise of nobody, the world did not need yet another late night talk show host, and his interviews with celebrities like Rob Schneider and Kathy Griffin failed to shake the world. Carson fell into a deep depression, became anorexic, discovered [[hookers and blow]] and ultimately lost his sense of humor along with his audience.

==It's Your Show==
In 2006 he signed viral video star Brooke "[[Brookers]]" Brodack of [[YouTube]] to a development deal with his production company.  He also hosted NBC Universal's [http://www.nbc.com/IYSTV/ It's Your Show] -- a [[YouTube]]-ish site on the [[internets]] where [[Saturday Night Live|anyone with a SAG/AFTRA card who hasn't worked in a while off-off-off-Broadway]] could post their [[fail]] videos while entering contests, and still [[fail|go nowhere]]. Of course, since Carson was on [[hookers and blow]] and [[old media|NBC Universal]] CEO Jew thought [[old media|Hulu]] was a better idea, [[Brookers|Brodack]]'s contract was dumped in the [[fail]] box, ''It's Your Show'' was cancelled and Daly went back to doing [[hookers and blow]] with [[Tom Green]].

==Carson the RickRoller==
Carson's ideas of funny range from Rickrolling his audience to browsing [[MySpace]] on the air to [[shopping]] a beard onto [[Paris Hilton]]'s bony face. On June 21st, 2007, when going through his daily drought of wit and originality, Carson decided he would borrow jokes from the black hole of the internet, 4chan, by [[Rickroll]]ing his audience. When 4chan received word that Carson would stoop so low as to borrow memes from them, the [[NBC.com Forums]] were raided the next day and flooded with [[Pain series]] and [[Lemon Party]] for hours on end, along with demands for an apology from Carson. In the end, NBC banned all the /b/tards and vowed not to run such a structurally retarded forum again.

Although many would have thought that Carson had learned his lesson, he decided to taunt the *chans again by playing [[Chocolate Rain]] on the air. Instead of Rainrolling his audience, he called ''Chocolate Rain'' the smash hit of the summer, what many believe to be catalyst of [[Tay Zonday]]'s spike in popularity, and likewise, highest level of lulziness.
