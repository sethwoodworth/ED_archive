{{FYI|MS no longer speaks of the Zune due to WP7 coming out. Good Night Sweet Prince}}

After releasing the [[Failure|shining achievement]] that was the [[Xbox 360]] to the public, [[Microsoft]] thought that they weren’t having enough [[money|cash]] sucked out of their [[assholes]], and decided to create the shit colored (and filled) music player called the Zune. Microshaft seems to be under the impression that the Zune is an [[iPod]] killer. This might have something to do with [[Bill Gates|Billy Gates’]] noggin’ being filled with Steve Job’s [[cum|man mustard]]. Mmm, business. The Zune comes in four different colors; [[Crazy|Psychopath White]], [[Emo|Fall Out Boy Black]], [[Scat|Scat Lover's Brown]], and [[Faggot|Homoerotic Pink]]. They also came out with [[Emo|Bloodshed Red]] [[last Thursday|last weekend]] or something. Another color for the [[emo|scene fucks]]!

==Why the Zune Sucks==
Because Bill Gates has a [[fetish]] for busted hardware, the Zune launched with many problems. Zune has an utterly [[Prince Jeremy|useless]] feature that lets you beam songs to other Zune users, since the only people in the [[world]] who own a Zune are Bill Gates, Tycho from [[Penny Arcade]], and [[Your Mom]]. You can only keep the songs for 'three days or three plays', which might be a result of all Zune users having [[shitty]] tastes in music. The Zune also has a series of useless Firmware updates, which have still yet to make the Zune any less shitty. We'd keep you posted, but it's already a lost cause.

The software got an update! Now it fucks up your library and puts fucking Green Day album art on ALL your music!

===The Zune and Bricking===

Like many Microsoft products, It is not compatible with other Microsoft products and it's said to have a form of some [[STD]], acquired when linking the Zune to its incestuous cousin, the [[360]] (''[[anal sex|stick it in my USB slot baby! Oh, yeah! Deeper!]]''). It's said that the 360 acquired this STD after Bill Gates decided that the Memory Card slot looked oddly like a [[vagina]] at the time, due to massive amounts of [[cocaine]] dancing around in his brain.

The best way to restore your Zune is to press back and up on the Dpad until [[Bill Gates|Satan]] is spawned from hell and  shits out another one from his ass.

==Why the Zune Rocks==
It's not an [[Steve Jobs|iPod]]. Also, it's got a big ass screen on it so that you can play your [[CP]] on it in the [[pedophile|Chuck E. Cheese]] bathrooms, you faggot.

Additionally, it just got semi-useful firmware updates! Now you don't have to listen to the [[Faggotry|Coldplay]] dickshit songs your gay cousin sent you within 3 days! You can keep them as long as you want but you can only listen to them three times. Which will probably never happen because who the fuck is going to listen to Coldplay?

Also, it has wireless sync now. So you can sync your CP FROM the [[pedophile|Chuck E. Cheese]] bathrooms! Xna games are totally free along with firmware updates <s>unlike the ipod touch which makes a person pay for new updates.</s> Fixed with iOS 4. Also it's been rated the #1 portable device for viewing horse pr0n, which is a major selling point which many Zune owners take pride in.

Apparently the Zune also has better sound quality then the ipod, Although if you own an ipod Steve Jobs' subliminal messages sneaked into the audio would say otherwise.

==The 2008 Zune Apocalypse==
[[Image:ZUNE copy.jpg|thumb|230px]]
{{quote|I had my Zune docked, and all the sudden I hear it start whirring as I'm sitting here at the laptop,I looked up just in time to see it restarting itself at exactly 12:00 midnight, and then, the freeze. Great. WHAT is going on!?| one man}}

Around midnight Pacific time December 31, 2008 30GB Zunes began restarting and locking up at their boot screens. Reports  swamped official forums and fan sites.Reported by hundreds of owners in forum threads at Zune.net and other sites, one of which already has over 1,000 replies, the 30GB model of Microsoft's Zune digital media player—and apparently only the 30GB model—entered a coma last Thursday. Whether a Zune was sitting idle or was in the middle of playing a song, users report that the device either shut itself off or restarted and then locked up at its boot screen. Microsoft said that a leap year issue caused problems with the 30-gigabyte versions of its Zune digital music player, following a flood of online customer complaints about the devices freezing up.

[[Image:ZUNES_CLOSED.jpg|thumb|[[Pool's Closed|Zune's Closed]]]]
Bill Gates made an appearance wearing a Windows Vista thong and issued a statement pinpointing “a bug in the internal clock driver related to the way the device handles a leap year.”  Which can be interpreted as [[Pool's Closed|ZUNE'S CLOSED DUE TO LEAP YEAR.]]

{{quote|Last night, the battery in my Zune 30gig just burst into flames for no reason  Shocked. I am not making this up. Has this happened to anyone else? What the hell is going on?|and the trolling begins...}}

{{quote|Emotions were running high on the Zune message board as some users said they were about to cry and others went so far as to say they might even die without their player.| [[Serious Fucking Business]]}}

==WHAT THE FUCK IN HD==
In September 2009, Microsoft released the Zune HD, a touchscreen media player with the sole purpose of kicking the iPod touch's ass. [[Shit nobody cares about|It has HD radio and can connect to a dock that lets it play HD video]]. It has little to any apps or games, much to the whinings of its respective users. The internet browser as of now doesn't support flash applications, and therefore cannot play YouTube. Currently available in 16, 32, and 64GB. 

With the release of Windows Phone 7, though, Microsoft has stopped caring about the Zune. There are talks about a [[Holy shit|Zune HD2]], but until an official statement by Microsoft, have fun trolling Zune Forums.
