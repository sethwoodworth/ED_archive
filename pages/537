== The Site ==

[[Image:Anonymuncule_homepage.JPG|thumb|center|The main page.]]

Due to the [[the cancer that is killing /b/]], sites like [[4chan]] now export more [[AIDS]] and [[fail]] than they do [[lulz]]. Plus, 4chan [[The Caturday Nap|seems to be]] [[4chan Gold Account|dying out]] and [[brb, compromised|constantly getting shut down anyway]]. To keep the [[lulz]] alive, some [[EDiot]]s decided to start Anonymuncule, the latest [[imageboard]] to hit the Internets. 

Also, "anonymuncule" is apparently a [[real]] word. [http://www.answers.com/topic/anonymuncule Srsly].

Because the site uses [[1337]] new features that other image boards don't have, plus the fact that it has not yet become well known enough to be infested with [[newfag|retard]]s, the site technically owns other sites. However, because the site is so new, it has yet to produce any win [[meme]]s.

== Rules ==

Ideally, the site should have [[Anarchy|no rules]], but some exceptions have to be made:

* Nothing [[illegal]], in order to avoid being [[V&]]. Apparently [[CP]], even if it's legal in [[Good Korea]] for some reason, it still is grounds for a [[banhammer]]. 

* There is currently an [[shit nobody cares about|ongoing debate]] about posting [[furry]] stuff of any sort should result in a [[banhammer]], but the [[OP]] of the thread was a furry [[faggot]] himself and it has pretty much been decided that [[furfaggotry]] should be [[perma-banned]]. However, a few were willing to let it be posted for the sake of lulz, like posting the shit art of potential [[lolcow]]s.

* No [[proxies]] or relays.

==Categories==

* '''Site News''': Self-explanatory. Should be useful in keeping up-to-date on current [[drama]] as well as any changes made to the site. 
* '''[[Random|Chance]]''': This is pretty much the equivalent of [[b/|/b/]]. Random shit is here, and thus the most popular board.
* '''[[Computer Science III|CSIII]]''': Computer-related posts go here.
* '''Request''': [[Pictures plz]].
* '''[[XXX]]''': This is where you post porn. [[Shock pictures]] may also appear, so be warned.
* '''Current Events''': A board for IRL news-related [[copypasta]].
*'''[[Torrent|p2p]]''': For downloading porn.
*'''[[Queer]]''': For all things gay.
*'''[[Halp|Plzadvize]]''': A place for [[noob|n00bz]] to ask [[retard|dumb]] questions.
*'''[[Photoshop|Shoop]]''': Place for [[shoop da whoop|shooping]].

Categories are currently being debated on site news, and the site could be updated to include a new section at any time. It it is requested [[moar]] categories could be added later to better organize the site, or simply [[for the lulz]].
