Michael Crawford
[[Fail|Unemploy<strike>ed</strike>able]] [[Asspie|computer programmer with schizo affective disorder]]. Michael D. Crawford sometimes lives in [[Canada]] or the USA based on what job he can get. 

<strike>Not</strike> to be confused with that [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY|fagot]] that starred in Phantom of the Opera OR [http://homepage.mac.com/psyborgue/ this guy]. 

Michael Crawford is one of those English icons from the 80's who is completely unimportant and unheard of by everyone in every other country, except maybe eurotrash immigrants who think musical theatre is important. Even the wads in North America who are addicted to everything Sondheim and Webber have no clue who this fag is.

[[Shit no one cares about|Michael Crawford is discriminated against for being mentally ill. This is usually the reason why he gets fired most of the time.
