H8

'''H8''' is [[netspeak]] for the word "''Hate''". It is generally used to describe a person who is "hating on" another person for [[religious]], [[racial]], political, or sexual beliefs.

[[Netspeak]] such as this can be found in many [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[conservative]] communities on [[LiveJournal]] and various other blogging websites.  It is also the easy way out of actually taking the time to type an entire word in an on-line chat. God forbid you press four keys when you can press TWO instead.

==H8 and YOU==
[[YOU]] can use hate in your never ending quest for glory: 
*Nothing to do? Hack a youtube account. 
*[[Gypsy]] stole your child? Slit her throat.

==Fact of the day==
The [[computer]] in "''2001: A [[Space]] Odyssey''", HAL 9000, was named after the [[bisexual|binary]] for "H8",  "H1000", which would make at least some sense if the computer was named HAL 1000, whilst Mr. Hat's surname is thought to be an abbreviation of "H8".
