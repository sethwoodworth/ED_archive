Plskthx
Also written as ''plzkthx''. [[Netspeak]] for "Please? Ok, thank you".
Often used in a sarcastic, quick way. Used when making a demand formed somewhat as a request. Ex. "I need [[op]]s, plzkthx."

Adding ''bai'' at the end is a good way to make a formal and polite request from someone just before departing from their presence. Ex. "Come pick me up for the concert tomorrow plskthxbi" *Walk away*
