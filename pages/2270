Dimensions
[http://www.dimensionsmagazine.com DimensionsMagazine.com] is a website for morbidly [[obese]] women and the sick fucks that want to penetrate them. The site is filled with pro-[[fat]] propaganda, fat fiction, and of course, a vast forum with more [[drama]] than a fat chick could muscle into her greedy mouth. They advertise SFW/softcore fat porn, and if pushed, would probably all to happy to openly support [[Voraphile|Voraphilia]]

== Recent Devolpements ==

The site recently suffered a downage when their servers were destroyed by an [http://forums.theplanet.com/index.php?showtopic=90185&st=20 explosion], probably caused by one of their fat fuck moderators trying to stuff in another hamburger.

They now are pushing the line that they [[Liar|really aren't that fat]], and that [http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/07/10/attitudes.overweight/index.html "It's all relative"] to how fat other [[Americunt|Americunts]] are. Srsly.
