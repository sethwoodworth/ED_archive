'''"[[Essjay]]"''' is a prominent editor and administrator on the English [[Wikipedia]].  He gained notoriety outside Wikipedia in February, 2007 when it was discovered he had fabricated academic achievements to the U.S. national press.

"Essjay" was interviewed for a [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] article on Wikipedia titled "Know It All" published in the July 31, 2006 issue.

New Yorker Magazine recently updated the article with a correction indicating that "Essjay" had identified himself as "Ryan Jordan". The New Yorker went on to state, "he was described in the piece as “a tenured professor of religion at a private university” with "a Ph.D. in theology and a degree in canon law.", he now claims he's actually "twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees, and that he has never taught."

According to ''Vancouver 24 Hours'', [[Daniel Brandt]] had discovered the Essjay/Ryan Jordan connection, and reported this to ''The New Yorker''

[[Jimmy Wales]], who claims he is the sole founder of Wikipedia and is founder of Wikia, said of this administrator's invented persona, "I regard it as a pseudonym and I don’t really have a problem with it."  

[[Larry Sanger]], who claims and is widely reported as the co-founder of Wikipedia, responded to Wales on his [[Citizendium]] blog:

<blockquote>
There’s something utterly breathtaking, and ultimately tragic, about Jimmy telling ''The New Yorker'' that ''he doesn’t have a problem'' with Essjay’s lies, and by essentially ''honoring'' Essjay after his lies were exposed.... Doesn’t Jimmy know that this has the potential to be even more damaging to Wikipedia than the Seigenthaler situation, since it reflects directly on the judgment and values of the management of Wikipedia?
</blockquote>

Jimmy Wales later issued a new statement on his Wikipedia User talk page that said the following:
<blockquote>
I have been for several days in a remote part of India with little or no Internet access. I only learned this morning that EssJay used his false credentials in content disputes. I understood this to be primarily the matter of a pseudonymous identity (something very mild and completely understandable given the personal dangers possible on the Internet) and not a matter of violation of people's trust. I want to make it perfectly clear that my past support of EssJay in this matter was fully based on a lack of knowledge about what has been going on. Even now, I have not been able to check diffs, etc.
<BR><BR>
I have asked EssJay to resign his positions of trust within the community. In terms of the full parameters of what happens next, I advise (as usual) that we take a calm, loving, and reasonable approach. From the moment this whole thing became known, EssJay has been contrite and apologetic. People who characterize him as being "proud" of it or "bragging" are badly mistaken.
</blockquote>

''[[Radar (magazine)|Radar Magazine]]'' poked fun at ''The New Yorker'' over the issue, stating that it "..only took the magazine's vaunted fact-checking department seven months.." to discover the identity of their interviewee.

These questions are to gauge community opinion on the situation regarding [[User:Essjay]]. There is prior discussion at [[User talk:Jimbo Wales#The New Yorker quotes you]], [[User talk:Essjay#New Yorker article]], and [[Wikipedia:Community noticeboard#Essjay-The New Yorker community discussion]], among other places.

====Essjay should step down from [[WP:RFAR|Arbcom]]====
=====Yes=====
#Essjay needs to step down. --[[User:AudeVivere|Aude]] <small>([[User talk:AudeVivere|talk]])</small> 14:03, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#Regarding my position on all [[User:Essjay|Essjay's]] current positions: the carrying-out of the duties associated with all of these require personal integrity.  Essjay's actions have called his personal integrity into question.  He should therefore step down from all positions, and be reinstated only if the community still trusts him enough to re-elect him despite recent events.  A strong signal also needs to be sent that Wikipedia will not brush off fraudulent claims as "just a pseudonym".  MartinMcCann 14:24, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
# He misrepresented himself, therefore he is not trustworthy enough for this position - [[User:Skysmith|Skysmith]] 14:26, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#The lack of judgment that Essjay showed when he fabricated his credentials and used them to gain leverage in debates is antithetical to what the community expects of one entrusted with so much power. He must be held accountable. [[User:A Train|A Train]] <sup><small><font color="DarkBlue">[[User_talk:A_Train|take the]]</font></small></sup> 14:27, 2 March 2007 (UTC)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;how did he use them to gain advantage?

#In addition to the revelations here, it concerns me that the December election produced a number of viable candidates who could and should have been selected ahead of someone who did not run for ArbCom. ArbCom needs members who are in a position of trust, and I feel that is lacking here. [[User:Sjakkalle|Sjakkalle]] [[User talk:Sjakkalle|<small>(Check!)</small>]] 14:30, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#He (may have) benefited from his misrepresented academic credentials. [[User:Gwen Gale|Gwen Gale]] 14:35, 2 March 2007 (UTC)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;how did he use them to gain advantage?

#He may not have benefited from his credentials in being appointed to arbitrator, but the trust is widely questioned. [[User:SYSS Mouse|SYSS Mouse]] 14:47, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#I cannot trust or respect the ArbCom's judgements as long as an admitted fabricator and liar is allowed to serve. [[User:FCYTravis|FCYTravis]] 15:04, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#Absolutely.  I do not trust him to judge other users.  The sockpuppet concerns over Robbie are also very troubling.  --[[User:Cyde|<font color="#ff66ff">'''Cyde Weys'''</font>]] 15:09, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#I just don't trust Essjay anymore. Sorry. [[User:PullToOpen|PT]][[User talk:PullToOpen|O]] 15:13, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#Yes.  Editors who get sitebanned by ArbCom routinely accuse Wikipedia and the Committee of malfeasance.

#This incident is only a small part of why I think this; I didn't like the idea of direct appointments to Arbcom, and I'm not convinced he would have passed had he decided to run in the election. That's not quite enough to ask him to step down, but combined with this, it is. -[[User:Amarkov|Amarkov]] <small>[[User_talk:Amarkov|moo!]]</small> 15:32, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#[[User:AnonEMouse|AnonEMouse]] <sup>[[User_talk:AnonEMouse|(squeak)]]</sup> 15:37, 2 March 2007 (UTC), unfortunately

#Sorry Essjay but I agree with all of the above, there is just too much going on. And Majorly brought up a good point; and I find the "Robbie" thing worrisome. ~ [[User:Arjun01|<font color="#7b68ee">'''Arjun'''</font>]] 15:54, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#Yes.  Essjay has betrayed the trust of the community, inside and out.  [[User:RFerreira|RFerreira]] 15:56, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
# If no action is taken, it will be a blow to the credibility of the Wikipedia project as a whole.  He has advanced himself as a representative of the project on a number of occasions, actively using his false credentials to bolster his own credibility.  It also appears that he has invoked his false credentials to defend substantive edits to the Wikipedia itself.  If the public is to be expected to treat the Wikipedia itself as credible or reliable, this kind of behaviour cannot be condoned.  He should step down to the level of a regular user, and work his way back up if the community allows him to. - [[User:Borfo|Borfo]] 16:04, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

#::I don't see how that detracts from my point.  Take it as the viewpoint of an outsider if you want, but that doesn't make my opinion any less valid.  Wikipedia isn't built just for people with five or more edits.  This is a public issue.  Weight my opinion however you like. - [[User:Borfo|Borfo]] 17:36, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#Yes: Lying to us is one thing, lying publicly about false qualifications to bolster wikipedia credence is another. Every wikipedia editor and their work is now suspect. [[User:Giano II|Giano]] 16:17, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
# Essjay should step down from ArbCom.  He has demonstrated that he is ethically challenged by lying to the press and repeatedly averring to fake credentials as evidence of his expertise on theological matters. // [[User:Netesq|Internet Esquire]] 16:25, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#:But it's not a court... and at least one other member has some ethical issue (which may or may not be true) that apparently does not affect his ability to arbitrate, why is it different for Essjay?  [[User:Miltopia|Milto LOL pia]] 16:28, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#::Cuz (to my knowledge) that other arbcomm member never claimed fake credentials (never mind to a reporter), but only picked his words very carefully in briefly describing his background. [[User:Gwen Gale|Gwen Gale]] 16:42, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#:::I can only assume that you are talking about Fred Bauder, who has a penchant for describing himself as a retired lawyer without noting that he was suspended from the practice of law before retiring and never reinstated.

#Agree with the above. [[User:Trebor Rowntree|Trebor]] 16:33, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
# ArbComm has to deal with evidence that is private from time to time.  We just had an entire case that was private, with only the outcome visible.  As we can't believe in Essjay's honesty, we can't trust him to handle evidence that is not visible.  That he didn't go through the usual election process is an aggravating factor here, but not the reason that he should resign.  [[User:GRBerry|GRBerry]] 16:36, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

# Sadly, I have to support this.

# ARBCOM should be our best representatives and Essjay has proven himself to fall short of that mark now.

Can we get an exact timeline here? He was appointed what, a week ago? This was a delayed scandal, really, I am pretty sure we knew he was "Ryan Jordan" before he was appointed to ArbCom.

Eight years ago both I and my disabled and dying father were protected by a ''criminal'' restraining order.  At that time I had legitimate safety concerns I wouldn't wish on anybody, yet I never found it necessary to exaggerate my credentials online as a result.  I simply didn't reveal certain things.

This isn't about telling true life stories. It's about misrepresenting them in an unhelpful or misleading way. If an editor asserts academic or employment credentials, the assertion should have something to do with reality or shouldn't be made at all. I mean, why didn't Essjay falsley claim to be a prison inmate instead? Cuz words have sway (erm, falsely claiming to be a convicted criminal wouldn't be ok either IMHO). So far as policy goes, lots of stuff we do in life has aught to do with whether some "policy" has been written on it. [[User:Gwen Gale|Gwen Gale]] 15:21, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

If an editor uses his/her background to underline his/her credibility in a certain area, we [[WP:AGF|assume that he or she is truthful about this]]. That is what keeps this community going. We are [[WP:BLP|wary of sources]], but we trust each other. If Essjay has done anything to harm the assumption of good faith by others towards him, he has gone too far. I can't tell whether he has, but I wonder what would happen the next time he asserts something. Because he will now be scrutinized more than anyone else.

# Speaking only for myself, Essjay's credibility has been completely destroyed by his claim that he "provided disinformation" in an attempt to thwart online stalkers.  That excuse does not hold water, and my experience has been that when someone demonstrates by his words and his actions that he cannot be trusted, that -- absent some truly bold gestures of remorse and contrition -- he should not be trusted.  On this note, Essjay lied about who he was, claiming credentials that he did not have and repeatedly averring to those credentials as proof of his expertise, and he succeeded in convincing quite a few people that he had those credentials and that expertise.  The only reason that he revealed his fraud was to gain a job at Wikia, and he has yet to own up to the fact that his original reason for lying was to garner respect that he did not earn, much less make any bold gestures of contrition. // [[User:Netesq|Internet Esquire]] 17:16, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

#It sucks because he would have been just as well-respected had he done all the good things he did while claiming to be a paralegal from [[Kentucky]], or for that matter, a plumber from Detroit (as long as he refrained from editing articles about plumbing).  Daniel Brandt's involvement in this is irrelevant; in this context he is only the messenger.  It's ironic that the Wikipedia community owes Brandt such a huge favor for unearthing and publicizing Ryan's hugely unforgiveable fraud.

#:Unearthing? Are you on crack? Essjay posted his real information a month ago on Wikia and changed his stuff here, then he told a lot of people about it and personally apologized to them. Brandt didn't do crap. [[User:pschemp|pschemp]] | [[User talk:pschemp|talk]] 18:39, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
:::Brandt's only contribution has been to hound Stacy Schiff and the New Yorker into posting the clarification by contacting Schiff's agent and book publisher; and doing things like writing snoopy letters to Essjay's priest asking to confirm his new story to make sure Essjay isn't still lying.  Yeah, let's give Brandt a medal. [[User talk:Thatcher131|Thatcher131]] 20:03, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#Yup.  No question about it.  [[User:ObiterDicta|'''ObiterDicta''']] <small>( [[User talk:ObiterDicta|pleadings]] • [[Special:Contributions/ObiterDicta|errata]] • [[Special:Emailuser/ObiterDicta|appeals]] )</small> 18:28, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
#Yep.  The major thing that bothers me is that he has used his claimed credentials to pose as an authority and weigh in (heavily) on some content issues.  Aside from those abuses &ndash; and abuses they are &ndash; of our trust, I have seen no evidence that he has done anything directly harmful to Wikipedia.  He has not (to my knowledge) misused any of his buttons (block, promotion, potection, etc.).  It might be best for the project if he stepped down as Arb, simply because trust and integrity play such a major part of the effectiveness of that role&mdash;and because, frankly, it is harmful to the project to have someone who has lied so thoroughly and for so long walk away scot-free.

====Without endorsing EssJay's actions, this straw poll is pointless because nothing is going to happen as a result and it only gives people who oppose Wikipedia something to point at and laugh====

#:Good grief ... I take it seriously too, but I'm also a realist.  Jimbo just appointed EssJay to arbcom even after the "scandal" broke.  Nothing is going to happen so it's not worth my time to devote too terribly much time and energy into it. --[[User:BigDT|BigDT]] 20:52, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
