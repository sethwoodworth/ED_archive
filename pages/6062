Opie and Anthony
{{quote|...the Opie and Anthony radio show; '''the most popular show in teh history of sattelite radio!!!1!!11!111one'''|Jay Leno, being a [[fanboy]]}}

'''Opie & Anthony''' are a [[brokeback mountain|pair]] of famous [[radio]] [[troll]]s who gained quite a [[shit nobody cares about|reputation]] [[at least 100 years ago]] by [http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200208/s657602.htm fucking up big time]. [[Last Thursday]], they [http://newsbusters.org/node/12771 fucked up again], all because they let some [[homeless]] black person on their show who proceeded to say he wanted to [[raep]] [[Condoleeza Rice|Condi Rice]] and [[W|Laura Bush]].

== Biography ==

In case you haven't noticed already, O&A are notorious for risking a [[permaban]] from [[radio]] [[trying too hard|just to get more listeners]].

The show is hosted by [[WASP|Gregory "Opie" Hughes]] (the [[epic]]ally [[unfunny]] one) and his cohost [[nazi|Anthony Cumia]] (the angry [[conservative]] one who likes to rant). Ant does most of the show's commentary and voicework. He also often pretends to be/exaggerates being a [[racist]] and [[anti-semitism|anti-semite]] just to [[troll]] black persons and Jews [[for the lulz]]. An occasional [[lolcow]], he is known for his [[love]] of [[gun]]s, [[beer]] and [[16 year old girl|teenage girls]], as well as his haet for [[Obama]] and [[liberal]]s. He is also no fan of [[House]].

Their primary audience consists of [[whores]], [[13 year old boys|adolescents]] and [[basement dweller]]s. Many are [[fucktard]]s who [[boring|can't contribute to the show humorwise]]. A few others are [[butthurt]] [[attention whore]]s who listen to the show just to call in and [[BAWWW|complain]] about how [[offensive]] it is to them, [[fail]]ing to recognize the fact that [[douchebag|they took time out of their day just to get on the show they hate in the first place]].

Before O&A were even together, [[Howard Stern]] used to "rule the airwaves". Despite their [[mundane|mediocre]] past, they eventually managed to [[pwn]] the Jew by [[In before X|moving to Satellite radio before he did]]. Stern then got a [[over9000|couple hundred million dollars]], and [[shit|Opie and Anthony]] admitted fail.

Opie and Anthony's passion for [[faggotry]] also extends to the internet, as any visit to their biggest fansite, [[masturbation|Wackbag]] will tell you. There, their [[unfunny]] fans spend hours posting lame jokes in a futile attempt to outdo each other in hopes that they will get noticed by their [[an hero|heros]] and somehow have meaning brought to their [[basement dweller|basement-dwelling]] lives.

On their show though, they deserve credit for consistently plugging [[The Power 5]] and trying to encourage the five people that haven't yet to go to [[meatspin]], [[lemonparty]] and [[tubgirl]]. They are responsible for introducing [[2girls1cup|2Girls1Cup]] to people who wouldn't normally watch [[whores]] eating [[shit]], as well as [[Tay Zonday]]'s rise to [[Internet celebrity|fame]] and [[meme]]dom. They also enjoy [[Google bomb|google-bombing]] in their spare time. [[1man1jar]] has just recently been added to their repertoire of [[pain series|fun-to-watch video discoveries]].

Along with [[at least 100]] other [[Dane Cook|shit comedians]], the [[third person|third mic]] of the show is Jim Norton,  aka [[cock|"Lil' Jimmy"]], a self-proclaimed [[sick fuck|creep]] and all-around [[troll|"silly goose"]] who is also quite fond of the [[lemonparty|"older gentleman"]], as he likes to put it. He is the show's main [[source]] of [[lulz|humor]], despite [[irony|not even having his name in the show's title]]. He does several characters [[for the lulz]], such as Steve from Yellowstone, who [[troll]]s & [[pwn]]s bad callers, and Ted Sheckler, who is a complete [[tool]] that [http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=jim+norton+ted owns many an emporium]. Sit-ins for him include [[Louis CK]] (which he co-starred with in the now-cancelled HBO sitcom [http://www.hbo.com/luckylouie/ Lucky Louie]), [[vomit|Bob]] [[faggot|Kelly]], fellow "Last Comic Standing" contestant Jew [[retard|Vos]], [[black|Patrice]] [[vegetarian|O'Neal]], and [[Chappelle]] Show's [[ginger|Bill]] [[leftard|Burr]].

Here, Lil' Jimmy explains the meaning behind the term, [[Chocolate Rain|"Monster Rain"]], an [[old meme]] popular among O&A [[fanboys]], found on his [[virgin|rarely-touched]] [http://reader.feedshow.com/show_items-feed=d0b862830684d46e617f04c2757bb504 Myspace blog]:

{{tinyquote|[[TL;DR|Recently I told the story of Monster Rain on the air and it’s been sweeping the nation ever since. I decided to post since many people now write me to ask what Monster Rain is. When I was in 1st or 2nd grade my friend and I would play this fun little game. We would be bored, walking around our apartment complex and one of us would yell, ”Monster Rain!” and we would both scamper under the porch to avoid being hit by it. While we were under the porch avoiding Monster Rain, we would kill time by telling stories and blowing each other. I am not sure what the tie in was between oral sex and the Monster Rain; hindsight dictates that an umbrella would have been more practical. I am also beginning to doubt that there was any real Monster Rain at all; I now suspect we were using this fictional occurrence just to get under the porch and kiss each other’s dingles. I don’t even remember the kid’s name to be honest, nor do I remember what he looked like. I do, however, remember one time he was wearing Budweiser swim trunks that smelled like moth balls. Just in case you have moments where you think your life sucks, at least you don’t have to contend with the memory of kneeling under a porch and performing oral treats on someone whose balls smelled like your grandmother’s closet.]]|Jim Norton, on his rarely-touched [http://reader.feedshow.com/show_items-feed=d0b862830684d46e617f04c2757bb504 Myspace blog] }}

Norton has recently stated that he also looks forward to playing this game with his [[idol]], Ozzy Osbourne. He also has stated that he wants to [[rape|date]] [[tubgirl]], and his character [[pedophile|Uncle Paul]] wishes to go out [[raep]]ing with [[Brian Peppers]] and [[Pedobear]]. One can can only imagine what levels of [[homoerotic]] [[lulz|hilarity]] he'll reach next.

He is also an [[unwarranted self importance|accomplished author]] with [[shameless self promotion|two New York Times best-sellers]], [http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=jim+norton+happy+endings&x=0&y=0 one autobiography and one collection of cebritard-bashing], and is a favorite guest on [[Fox News]]' "Red Eye" with Greg Gutfeld. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoN7uYD1PjU] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w8XY0zbDQ8] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usp0pmRPZvo] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNdKFe2ZL0E]

[[Some argue]] he should receive the ED Seal of Approval for calling out [[Tom Cruise]] and the [[Scilons]] on their [[faggotry]]. Unfortunately, he's probably not famous enough with the [[internets]] for this medal of honor.

== Show Characters ==

<center><youtube>in02LCdufUc</youtube></center>

===Stalker Patti===

Mangy, [[unfunny]] old hag and [[slut]]ty [[virgin]] who smells of bad coffee.

===Louis "Twitchels" Centanni===

Suffers from [[Tourette's]] and used to be a regular on O&A.

===Andrew aka [[goatse|"Big A"]]===

[[Dead]], filthy, [[homeless]] [[faggot]].

===Half-a-Hulk Face===

Another former regular of the show who suffers from [[swirlface|"Elephant Man's disease"]] and [[drunk|slurred speech]].



== O&A Staff ==

And, lastly, what would the O&A show be without the [[shit nobody cares about|various characters hard at work behind it all]]? Here's a taste of some of those [[idiots|people]]:

[[Image:steve-carlesi.jpg|thumb|left|"If you see me [[i came|comin']], best get outta moi way!"]]

===Steve Carlesi aka "Steve [[cunt|C]]"/ "Steve the [[Bear]]"===
[[fag|Swishy]] [[hirsute|Lebanese]] [[Unwarranted self importance|executive producer]] and former leader of the shitty band Foundry, known for their [[lie|lyrically brilliant smash hit]] "Pendulum". He runs the [http://www.foundrymusic.com/ clusterfuck of a website by the same name], which houses [http://www.opieandanthony.com/ the show's official website] that [[noone]] uses anymore.

The site consists mainly of links to every show of the week, show-related/topical videos, [[pr0n]] videos for users to [[fap]] to, [[music|concert footage/music videos]] and shitty IRL accident/police videos, all captioned with Steve's [[lie|excellent grammar skills]] and [[watermark]]ed with the [[Shit|official Foundry logo]] (which is large, opaque, and blocks half the screen). Unfortunately, he has completely ceased posting rundowns, due to his immense levels of incompetence, [[fail]] and [[faggotry]].

===Eric Nagle aka "Erock"/[[lol wut|"Sexbagel"]]===

Co-producer and [[fat]] [[fucktard]]. Brings nothing to the table, yet [[voraphile|consumes everything from it]]. Loves the "[[guido|Garlic]] [[Peanut Butter Jelly Time|Butter]] [[Saw]]".

==="Primetime" Sam Roberts===

Associate producer and [[white]] [[nigra]] (not to be confused with [[wigger]]). Also known as the "[[Albino]] [[Aborigine]]". He fetches show-related videos for the official site and eats [[chikins|mcnuggets]] like the [[negro]] [[child]] he is. Big [[wrestling]] [[fanboy]], especially of [[John Cena]].

===Club Soda Kenny===

Former [[cop]] and part-time comic, he is now one of the show's bodyguards and a hulking [[retard]].

===Master Po===

The show's other security guard. Not as [[stupid]] or clumsy as CSK, but much more of a [[douchebag]]; plus, [[Matrix|he knows Kung-Fu]]. Now replaced by [[plagiarism|"Master Joe"]].

===David "the Intern" Fried===

A young [[asspie]] Jew recently hired as an intern. Host of the [[fail|"David & Bobo Show"]]. No longer part of the program.


===Bobo===
The other host of the now-defunct "David & Bobo Show", Bobo is a quarter-retard who had 46 dick surgeries due to [[shit nobody cares about|a birth defect known as hypospadias (which also is the reason his penis is a girthy two inches)]]. He has plans to take his coworker, Christina, to the Queens Motor Inn where he will go "pussy-diving". Never missing a chance to be homoerotic, the crew once had him take off his pants, where they'd watch him get an erection when they talked about Christina, and go down when they talked about baseball. Haters and fucktards complain when he comes on, but [[Louis_CK]] has called the Up and Down game one of the funniest things he'd ever heard, so they can shut the fuck up.
