'''Stephh Fkn Money''' is a fascist Jew [[cunt]] and mental [[drama]]llama. She is [[internets]] notable for mistaking [[crossmack|Ian Crossland]] to be the second coming of Christ. Drama involving "Stephh" is considered to be vastly spread across the [[internets]]; however, remains somewhat of an ''unsolved mystery''. What is known is that Stephh is an [[emo]] cutter, and is a huge [[camwhore]] who is currently "raging" over sand black persons somewhere on [[Stickam]].com [http://www.stickam.com/profile/masochisst].

When not potentially raging over internet [[faggotry]] or [[Ian Crossland]], Steph can be found [[cutting]] herself in her bedroom while quietly listening to burnt copies of ''Fallout Boy'' records.
