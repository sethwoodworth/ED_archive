<center>[[File:Legi0nbanner.jpg|500px||It only gets worse.]]</center>

Ever wondered what would happen if you took the [[FCTC]], stripped them of all the pedestrian accomplishment of [[phishing]] various YouTube [[furries]], added [[Chris chan]] and a shitload of [[USI|unwarranted self importance]]? 

[http://legi0n.info/ Legi0n] is such an abomination. The end result of what happens when harmless newfaggotry boils over into fullblown delusion, Legi0n has provided countless examples of delicious drama and what happens when a group of children tease a retard and confuse it with [[Trying too hard|hardcore Anonymous business]].

==Early History==
[[File:KrappleMakesAnArt.jpg|thumb|right|Krapple's idea of epic trolling.]]
In the time that [[CWC|Christian Weston Chandler]] has graced the internet with tales of [[Autism|autastic]] adventure, many an aspiring troll have tried to capatalize on the seemingly endless source of [[lulz]] that stood to be gained at the manchild's expense. Some of them incredible, some of them mundane. But as with all good things, it came to an end. As with any decent lolcow, soon the less talented amount the various corners of the internet to get their time to shine, and before you know it, the once tranquil waters had been pissed in by everyone within earshot of JULAAAAAAAAAAAAAY. The dream had died, and Chris chan was left to stew in his filth. The "trolling" had yet to cease, however. Far from it, as every furfag, weeaboo and /b/tard that witnessed the beast in action attempted to get in on the action to prove to the internet that they too could produce the lulz so long as the target was an honest to God retard.

One of these budding pioneers was a young [[User:VanKrause|Mark Ortiz]], who stumbled across Chris chan towards [[Old meme|the end of 2008]]. Deciding that Chris was the [[Lame|funniest fucking thing]] he had ever seen, Krause headed over to the Krapple Komputer Kompany, a service which allowed anyone to create a customized imageboard and be admin of the sole board. He created /cwc/, and the boards popularity soared, becoming the most popular board on KKK.  It was around this time that he adopted the name "KrappleGuy". Enjoying his newfound popularity, Krappleguy advertised Chris chan to the unwashed masses and rubbed elbows with the various [[faggots|seasoned CWC trolls]].

As fate would have it, KKK closed its doors, leaving Krappleguy without his board. Somehow stumbling across [http://789chan.org 789chan], krapple convinced that chan's admins to host Legi0n, a full imageboard for /cwc/ and [[shit nobody cares about|various other boards]].

==/CWC/==
The [[Shit|crowning jewel]] and most popular board by far, /cwc/ is where the action is. Championing itself as [[LOL WUT|the place where intelligent CWC enthusiasts gather]], /cwc/ is exactly what's to be expected. Hundreds of asspies gather round and partake in everything from troll operations and armchair psychology on Chris chan. /cwc/ continued to build its legend and only proceeded to grow in traffic and [[e-fame|popularity]] as a, but still not quite ''the'', top source in Chris chan and Chris chan accessories.

{{Main|Ickeriss69}}
Luck would strike in the form of a malnourished mall goth when Krappleguy made the acquaintance of [[Ickeriss69]], who had previously made himself known in the CWC community for being an [[Poser|epic troll]] by coming into the possession of Chris' infamous Sonichu medallions and destroying them on camera. Around this time, however, Ickeriss was in something of a rut; specifically, those pictures of his pale, crooked dick had been circulating around YouTube along with him sobbing uncontrollably to an ex-(internet)girlfriend YouTube troll. [[Trolled|Ashamed and humiliated]], Icky had been in the midst of a speedy internet retreat, blocking trolls and flagging evidence of just what kind of [[pussy|super badass Anon]] he actually was by the time Krapple had crossed his path. Krapple, however, held a different opinion; Krapple saw a man who had become a [[pathetic|legend in the world of Professional CWC trolling]]. Seeing a change to add a trolling [[failure|celebrity]] to his staff, he immediately begged Ickeriss to come on board. Icky, realizing that there was an entire base of people that had yet to discover what a twink he actually was, leaped at the opportunity, and flung himself into Legi0ns operations headfirst, establishing himself as a [[douchebag|valuable commodity]] to the group, becoming its de facto figurehead in the process. Icky's involvement brought a new wave of popularity to /cwc/ and Legi0n, but knowing full well anyone that could [[Google]] would eventually stumble across his less than flattering past, Ickeriss had changed his alias to [[TF2|Medic]], word-filtered "[[Powerword|Ickeriss]]" off of /cwc/, and does everything in his power to maintain his faggot cult of personality he has cultivated; most of which banning people that upset him personally and claiming he's [[crybaby|doing it for the benefit of the board]].
[[File:ArmyofMedics.png|thumb|right|The illusion unravels.]]
As of August 13, 2010, Icky was summarily [[pwnd|ousted from legi0n]]. On his way out the door, he threatened to take all the other members with him, but unfortunately for him, nobody else wanted to go. [[lol|They were all sick of his shit]].

==Notable Legi0n Feuds==

===CWCki===
[[File:IckyPurging.png|thumb|right|Legi0n handling both competition and dissent like true professionals]]
The ''actual'' number 1 source for Chris chan related information, Legi0n had always maintained an uneasy relationship with the [http://www.cogsdev.org/cwcki/Main_Page CWCki], a Chris-Chan centric wiki. That there was a better known hub of retard stalking just didn't sit well with Legi0n, especially ones that allowed [[furfag]] contributors, and so members of Legi0n decided that they would head on over to CWCki and rape the user pages of said editors. While this would normally constitute a [[win]], it was done out of [[nerd rage|genuine spite]] that there was a bigger Chandler site than /cwc/, and as such amounted to little more than a dick measuring contest (though given [[Ickeriss69|Medic]]s frequency to whip out his ghost white wanker at the drop of a hat, this should come as a surprise to nobody). Thus, Medic and various other Legi0n officials decided that a raid was in order.

Except for the fact that nobody supported them. In a [[hilarious|shocking]] display, most of the boards traffic decided that the idea of a turf war over the exclusive rights to teasing a retard wasn't necessarily the most lucrative of operations, and promptly told Legi0n staff [[gtfo|that this was an ill fated and unnecessary venture]] that would only serve to distract from the boards main goal of autistic analysis. Medic proceeded to ban every member of the board to tell him just what a dumb cunt he actually was, all the while accusing the CWCki and it's Admins of USI.

This was done for about a week before Legi0n pulled their heads out of their collective assholes and realized that insulting and banning most of their users might, in fact, not be the best way to keep traffic flowing to the site, and immediately halted the mass banning. The [[bullshit|"official"]] reason for the bans was a  [[delete fucking everything|"purge thread"]], i.e. /cwc/ was trimming it's fat and getting rid of unsavory elements. 

It still remains to be seen what exactly was gained from making it [[Lie|"just look like]]" they attempted to initiate an e-war and rage-banned people who called them out on their butthurt, besides looking like they're all completely full of shit, but yeah, [[It was a social experiment|it all went according to plan]].

[[File:Eds1legi0n1.jpg|thumb|[[BFF]]s 4 lyfe]]		
In true [[Loser|epic ween troll]] form, Legi0n were not unfamiliar with the unfortunate effects of [[trolls trolling trolls]], and this was made no more clearer than in their ill fated attempts at attacking [[EDSingers]] affiliates. Early on, Legi0n had a cordial and professional relationship with EDS, even becoming lyrical fodder for some of the groups songs. Things went well until Medic and other lesser Legi0naires decided it would be hilarious to dox and raid an individual who was attempting to troll EDS1 for reasons that, like the legendary "CWCki Raid Thread Purge", made sense to them and them alone. After obtaining an address, Legi0n tried to have hookers sent to the lad's house.
	 	
Nothing happened, although said gentleman was eventually made aware of Legi0n's attempt and promptly [[DDOS]]'d the board, knocking it offline for a few days.
	 	
Legi0n did not retaliate.

===Riley34470===


In another example of Krapple and Legi0n's constant longing for the approval of better, more established trolls, the Riley34470 "trolling" was done in an attempt to gain favor with [[Cyanterrorist]]. Almost a year after Riley34470 stopped being relevant. In spite of that, Krapple went to work, making YouTube videos and [[prank call]]ing Riley for days, confident he was making a name for himself and Legi0n among trollin's big boys. What Krapple didn't count on was Riley [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|actually getting his own dox]], courtesy of [[Brittany Holechko]]. Krapple found himself at an impass, but soldiered on like a true [[dumbass|troll]], posting Rileys bizarre and constant phone calls to his YouTube account, showing everybody that Riley was all super butthurt and that he had [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/John_Solomon#Potential_Meme.28s.29.3F played him fine!]

The actual evidence, however, is less than convincing;

<center><youtube>HvmTMzYikt4</youtube></center>
[[File:Ihmomnomdox.png|thumb|right|A lot like this, except [[Sad|the bitch '''actually fucking did it'''.]]]]
===Brittany Holechko===

{{Main|Brittany Holechko}}

A personal favorite of Krapple, Brittany Holechko was given Legi0ns full attention due to the fact that she is, in all actuality, the female Chris chan, and since Legi0n [[Lie|could only ever troll Chris chan with any measure of actual success]], this seemingly played into their one strength. Krapple and friends dedicated [http://il.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xf4qKhjP4 video] after [http://il.youtube.com/watch?v=S9q8ks9n1tE= video] after [http://il.youtube.com/watch?v=O26YUXaRvoo video] to trolling, exposing, and generally tormenting IHM, complete with compiling a list of [http://wiki.legi0n.info/index.php?title=List_of_IHM%27s_crushes her failed e-romances]. Sticking to what they knew, Legi0n realized that if they stuck to trolling people that had been decimated long before they came along, they could do as generations of trolls before them had done and claim to be true and honest trolls while feasting upon the dry carrion of long milked lolcows while never actually being at risk. It was the perfect plan.

Until somehow, Brittany actually made good on her usual empty threats and [[epic win|actually dox'd Krappleguy]], passing the information to his arch rival Riley34470. This brought Brit's record to 2 Legi0n members trolled, counting her involvement with Ickeriss' fall from YouTube grace. On top of it all, she too DDOS'd Legi0ns imageboard. They, again, did not retaliate.

Read that again; Legi0n was actually trolled by [[Fat|Brittany]] [[Goth|Holechko]]. [[raped|Thoroughly]].

===The [[Darksidered992]] Saga===

One day, Legi0n got it in them to try impressing Cyanterrorist one more time, and concluded it would be awesome if they went after yet another [[old|primed]] lolcow, Garrick "Dark Side Red" Colwell; again, that it had been years since people gave two shits about DarkSideRed wasn't the slightest hindrance to the operation. But Legi0n decided to kick things up a notch and take the trolling straight to Garrick. 
[[File:AtlusTrollsU.jpg|thumb|right|Who's next?]]
[[Image:AndrewHappy.jpg|thumb|right|Holy shit!  I'm [[Pathetic|a REAL LIFE TROLL NOW!]]]]
Holy fuck, what turn around! Legi0n had gone from failing at prank calling a pillow biter to rolling right up on fuckers door steps! Surely, [[unrealistic expectations|Legi0n had arrived]].

<video type="vimeo" id="12479650" width="400" height="400" desc= frame="true" position="center"/>

Except by "personally trolling DarkSideRed", they just kind of knocked on his door and said "Hi". And that's pretty much it. Specifically;

{{quote|I was actually there for about five minutes, and ended the video a bit early. We chatted about me a little bit, and I told him I respect his decision to remain off the nets, and the conversation remained friendly and respectful.

Oh yeah. Feel that heat? That's Legi0n, motherfucker.

[[Image:TohotforED.png|thumb|Hear that, motherfuckers?  '''TO''' [[Stolen|HOT]] for ED!]]
Not content with their rousing [[Lemon Party|success]] at trolling, Legi0n were also the keepers of their very own [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|trollin wiki]]! Filled with their own [[plagiarism|completely exclusive]] tales of internet shit stirring, Legi0npedia detailed the epic adventures Legi0n and their cohorts had [[fail|trolling]] the various plebs that plague their internets, along with details of epic [[copypasta|plans to come]] and thorough accounts of what exactly [[buttsex|notorious internet terrorists like them were up to]].

<center>[[File:Plagerpedia.png||800px|]]</center>
[[Image:Legi0nriley.png|thumb|400px|center|And again.]]

==The End of Legi0n?==
[[File:Legi0ndies.png|thumb|right|Icky had made good on his threats. [[Not|Sort of]].]]
[[File:Legi0nblankin.png|thumb|right|[[Lie|Krapple and legi0n totally don't care about their article]].]]
After Ickeriss' brave leadership led the clique right to [[buttsex|annals]] of Encyclopedia Dramatica, Legi0n determined that the once glorious Medic needed to step away from the reigns of power. Medickeriss, as classy as ever, flipped his shit entirely and decided that [[Ickeriss69#.22Hey_Guys_I_Intentionally_Christian_Weston_Chandler.22|if he didn't get to be a Chris-chan trolling cool gui then nobody got to be and threatened to expose horrifying and irreparably damaging information to Chirs-chans handlers that would totally and completely prevent any future trolling. Ever.]]

It is expected that this latest [[faggotry|totally ingenious and rather large, complex and elaborate trolling]] on Icky's part will be met with [[None|his usual amount of success]]. Suffice to say, <strike>the number of people openly and proudly trolling under the name of Legi0n has [[gtfo|drastically diminished]]</strike> on August 27th Legi0n closed it's doors, moving /cwc/ and keeping the board online as an archive. While this was a completely voluntary decision by management, it's assumed Ickeriss will eventually claim some form of credit for forcing the closure. Well, some credit other than "[[Truth|I was a huge faggot and they shut down due to shame that they had been associated with me and people like me]]". That part he'll probably leave out.

Thought Legi0n finally learned their lesson about faggot mods after Ickeriss, too?  Think again.  Meet SeanieB: owner of 789chan.  When he's not being a totally [[hardcore]] troll or [[Mac]] fanboy, he's admining on [[Sonic The Hedgehog]] forums.  Once again, Legi0n accepts only the finest into their ranks of internet [[failure|terrorist]] elite.

Regardless, a [[Lie|"Legi0n-free"]] /cwc/ can now be found [http://789chan.org/cwc/ here]. New location, same nagefaggin, USI-havin', Patty diggin', tantrum throwing flavor!
