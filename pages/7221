'''San Francisco''' is famous for its [[gay]] and for being the center of [[California]]'s homosexual escapades. Its expensive, full of yuppies, fags, dykes, [[Azn|Azn's]] (mostly [[China|Chinese]] and [[Philippines|Filipinos]]), [[goths]], crackheads, and worst of all, [[hipster|"artists"]].
 
[[Burning Man]] started here, as if that were anything to be proud of. San Francisco has also supplied the entire world with [[drugs|LSD]] since 1966. It has been scientifically proven that every single resident of San Francisco is an [[ADD|unreliable flake]].

San Francisco is home to the [[Jew_Gold|Golden]] Gate Bridge, the world's favorite place to become [[an hero]]. It it is red. It's not fucking gold. 
<br>To cross it in a car you must pay a $5 toll. However, it has been shown repeatedly that two persons driving with a large dog sitting upright in the back seat can cross for free by saying "carpool" to the toll booth attendant.

San Franciscans get pissed off when they hear anyone call it "Frisco". Do with that what you will.

{{quote|Whoever after due and proper warning shall be heard to utter the abominable word "Frisco", which has no linguistic or other warrant, shall be deemed guilty of a High Misdemeanor, and shall pay into the Imperial Treasury as penalty the sum of twenty-five dollars.|[[USI|Emperor Norton]] on why "Frisco" is [[serious business]].}}

==Politics==
[[Image:Beggars.JPG|thumb|Yet another typical scene in San Francisco.]]
In the U.S. Presidential election of 2004, a full 86% of San Francisco's population, including all the Chinese old people and illegal [[prostitutes|"masseuses,"]] voted against [[George W. Bush]]. Oh well. 

Apart from that, one of San Francisco's main political exercises is to draft ballot measures aimed at rounding up the enormous multitudes of filthy "[[homeless]]" beggars and shipping them off to work camps in [[Arizona]]. Unfortunately, "homeless advocacy" groups guilt-trip and blackmail proponents into watering these measures down to such an extent that even if the measure passes, nothing whatsoever actually happens to the bums and derelicts who continue to spend their days sprawled face-up across the Market Street sidewalk, diseased hands extended to passers-by, and their nights digging crack rocks out of sidewalk cracks and then taking a shit in someone's doorway. 

There are 7,721 of these tubercular and brain-damaged beggars roaming the Streets of San Francisco, though the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WSu8qIPGXU former mayor], who is a known [[dyslexia|dyslexic]], [http://sfgov.org/site/mayor_page.asp?id=58094 claims there are only 2,771].

In 2007 San Francisco's Mayoral election included [[idiot|morons]] named [http://www.voteforchicken.org Chicken], [http://www.joshwolf.net Wolf], [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=/c/a/2007/08/18/BA9ORKTDL.DTL&o=1 Grasshopper], and [http://captaindemocracy.wordpress.com/ "Captain Democracy"], as well as a [http://terracottainn.blogspot.com/2007/03/san-francisco-mayoral-candidate-running.html nudist who wants to make Golden Gate Park clothing optional], a [http://www.sfweekly.com/2007-07-25/news/vote-for-a-real-clown/ couch-surfing clown busker], and the owner of San Francisco's largest [[BDSM|sex club]].

Also, it should be noted that there are [[at least 100]] fights that go on every day on Muni. Just see below:

== Areas of San Francisco ==

San Francisco is usually somewhat over-extended to include the entire San Francisco Gay Area, which encompasses at least three distinct areas:

'''San Francisco Proper:''' The city of San Francisco was once culturally and artistically amazing, but now it's so fucking expensive that artists and musicians can't afford to live there anymore. Therefore, don't expect to see any good local bands. Because of the insanely expensive real estate, the only [[Black]] people who live in San Francisco are [[ghetto]] and live in projects. All other [[Black]] people live across the bridge in Oakland. So the majority of the population is wealthy [[yuppies]], [[Azn|Azn's]], and [[faggot|gays]] who are either [[yuppies]] or [[Azn]]. The city is also full of [[hipster]]s, but the ones in SF are especially annoying because they think since the city is supposed to be artistic they must be too. Overall though, San Francisco is cultured and a nice place to hang out, if you like hanging out at [http://www.starbucks.com Starbucks].

'''The South Bay:''' Roughly extending from Redwood City down to San Jose, the South Bay is a cultural wasteland and a large [[suburb]] known as Silicon Valley. Many large tech and computer companies such as [[Apple]], IBM, Cisco, [[Google]], [[Yahoo!]], etc are headquartered there. The area used to be considered a nice place to live, but due to the massive influx of illegal [[Azn|Azn's]], the area now resembles [[Vancouver|Hong Kong]]. The city of Cupertino for example, now has a public high school that is 100% [[Azn]]. Aside from the $2,000,000 you'll pay for a home, there's nothing to distinguish any of the South Bay from the suburbs of any other major city that's been invaded by Azn's. Note that this area also includes what is sometimes referred to as the Peninsula, to some people, to others the Peninsula is a separate region. The Peninsula is most of San Mateo County. It extends roughly down to the area below Palo Alto.

'''The East Bay:''' Oakland and the surrounding area is much like San Francisco proper, except more ghetto, cheaper, and a lot more murder. Oakland is where all the [[Blacks]] in the Bay Area live, and is also the birthplace of [[wigger|wiggers]], [[Black|The Black Panthers]] and Tupac Shakur. In East Oakland, you can see black people killing each other on a nightly basis. Berkeley, which is right next door, is famous for being home to all the bitter [[liberal]]s that have been pissed off since [[Nixon]] was elected. Further north, in Richmond, you can experience the same joys as East Oakland, but instead of on a nightly basis, it's on an hourly basis. While Oakland is sometimes jealous of San Francisco, the East Bay has a surprising amount of arts, culture, and fun - if you consider graffiti, Hip-Hop, and murder to be art, culture, and [[lulz|fun]]. Also, the East Bay has a great view of beautiful San Francisco, while San Francisco has a view of [[Africa|Oakland]]. Also also, Beast in Pig Latin is East Bay, so it must be cool.

The East Bay is also home to local pedophile [[Creepy Phil|Phil Garrido]], who lives in Antioch and is currently facing 29 charges including kidnapping a [[loli]] for the sole purpose of [[Josef Fritzl|raping her]] and bearing children. 

'''Fisherman's Wharf:''' The northern waterfront area of San Francisco from Ghirardelli Square or Van Ness Street, [[Maddox|ass pirate]]s descend from ships and rape young boys like Catholic priests. The villagers live in constant fear of the local pirate population. The intro video of ABC's ''Full House'' features Fisherman's Wharf, with scenes of [[Bob Faget]].

'''The North Bay:''' Also known as Marin County, the richest per-capita county in America, or "utter [[shit]]". The North Bay is the only part of the Bay Area with no BART, primarily because they care more about property values and keeping out "undesirable influences" than the integrity of the community. The people who live in Marin are either ex-[[hippies]] with a lot of money (usually from real estate) who want to fuck over [[black people]] without having to deal with them, their entitled children, or (most recently) successful members of Generation X who are only seen in public [[pregnant]], with a stroller, and a latte from Starbucks. Unless you're willing to put down $30 for a 75 minute folk show starting at 6:30, there's nothing to do within the county limits but [[drugs|crystal meth]] or [[Soshesays|psychosis]]. Every teenager who grew up in Marin wants to move to [[Europe]].

'''The Coastside:''' To the south of San Francisco proper, even below South San Francisco, lies Pacifica. The coastside extends from there all the way down to an interesting hybrid [[hippie]]/[[redneck|hick]]ville called Half Moon Bay. Don't be fooled though: the city of Half Moon Bay and all the little minor towns to the north of it are unbearably dull and the only decent thing to ever come from there was a fuckload of [[drugs|meth]]. Pacifica, which has a closer proximity to the actual city, is poorer, smellier, and has more hicks. Actually, most [[KKK]] meetings, which are held regularly in Millbrae, have more blacks than Half Moon Bay does.

'''South San Francisco:''' [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.663417+-122.41835 The Industrial City].

'''The Clubs:''' San Fransisco is notorious for the amount of titty-bars, and strip clubs that could be seen by just driving a couple city blocks. Most of them being ran by Jews, attract many a thousand. In certain areas of "the city", such as the Castro District, California's asshole, as /b/ is the internet's asshole, there can be found many gay bars. These are usually peaceful, but make great targets for terrorism, or a public display of hatred.
