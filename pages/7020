[[Image:RDTIhaet2.jpg|thumb|right|The truth about RobDoesTheInternet.]]
'''RobDoesTheInternet''' is a [[MySpace troll]] whose real name, [[some argue]], is in fact Hunter (though they are wrong, he is a [[Eurofag]] with a [[TL;DR]] and unpronounceable last name. He is even fluent in [[Moonspeak]]). Rob is known for being the best/worst (depending on your [[POV]]) example of [[internet humanitarianism]] evar. However, Rob is no prude, and [[camwhore|takes revealing photos]] to use for [[cyber sex|undercover operations using fake profiles disguised as  himself]]. All sorts of [[jailbait]] on MySpace drool over his pics, but Rob is either completely fucking oblivious to this, or, more likely, he's [[gay]]. Also, though he claims to hunt [[troll]]s, it is quite likely that he is just a troll, one whose act has been generally unhindered for a long time.

==Internet Humanitarianism==

''Main article: See [[Mission: MySpace]]''

[[Contrary to popular belief]], Rob is [[not gay]], though he pretends to be on the internet. Having run [[Mission: MySpace]] for over a year, he knows how to hunt MySpace profiles, and will likely get [[you]] deleted for [[bullshit]] reasons. However, the Mission: MySpace venture ended when Rob/Hunter turned down a job offer from [[MySpace]], and was then [[baleet]]ed by a horde of [[babyfur]]s who mass-reported him. However, Rob did manage to get [[over 9000|over 7000]] MySpace profiles removed. Unfortunately, [[at least 100]] of those were righteous [[troll]]s and [[Anon]]s. Despite his overwheming number of failures, he was resonsible for starting the most massive [[fursecution]] attack on MySpace to date, making him a [[hero]] to some but a [[lulzcow]] to the rest of the internets.

==[[Internet model]]ing==

[[Image:Bedpic.jpg|thumb|RobDoesTheInternet asking for some [[buttsecks]].]]

Rob was [http://www.modsheet.com/breaktheline the internet's top model] as of [[last Thursday]]. If that doesn't prove that he is [[gay]], nothing will. On top of that, Rob had joined [[ModelMayhem]], a site full of [[homosexual]]s. Showing his true colors as a [[troll]] (though he claims to hunt trolls), he started an [[epic]] [[flame war]] on that site with all sorts of people he called [[sick fuck]]s, who had default pictures that were [[BAWWW|against the site's TOS]]. Though the [[faggot]] moderators sided with him, Rob [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|left the site]]. [[Some argue]] he will return, though it will likely be only to troll.

UPDATE: [[Raptor Jesus|he has returned]], but it is [[porn|obviously not for trolling]]. [http://www.modelmayhem.com/vengeance Behold the faggotry]

==Theories==

[[Image:Rdtin1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bullshit|Yeah, that really helps bust perverts]].]]

Some argue Rob does everything [[for the lulz]], and should be treated as any other troll. Evidence for this theory:

&bull; He knows almost every fucking [[meme]] on the [[internet]] and [[trying too hard|tries too hard]] to show off his netspeak knowledge.

&bull; He makes fake profiles of [[16-year-old girl]]s for pedo hunting on [[MySpace]]. Before getting the pedos [[partyvan|v&]], when the pedos offer to trade nudes with his fake, Rob will reply to teh pedo n00dz with [[goatse]].

Some argue Rob is [[gay]] and [[unfunny]]. Evidence for this theory:

&bull; He takes revealing pictures of himself, but does not have a girlfriend.

&bull; He was a [[MySpace celebrity]].

&bull; He has a [[MySpace]].

&bull; He made a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-vQMleB2ZE video making fun of Anonymous], though many speculate this was done to troll.

&bull; Popped collar.

&bull; He's a [[Republican]].

&bull; Read his [http://blog.myspace.com/myspacevigilantejustice blog]. '''Baleeted.'''

&bull; Apparently he composes metal music, well, he says he does, but there is no proof. Still, [[gay]].

Now if a 19-year-old guy says that, [[some argue]] he is simply [[asexual]], but considering his burning hatred for all forms of [[secks]], it is suspected he either lacks a [[cock]] or took part in the BME Pain Olympics, <s>though his voice indicates otherwise</s>. Voice synthesizers.

==Other Ventures==

Rob made it on the news for his internet humanitarianism, became the internet's top model, and even attained [[e-fame]] for a brief period. However, he's [[complete rewrite|starting from scratch]]. He's moved to [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]]. Who knows where he'll end up next. Hopefully [[GTFO|off the internets]], though likely in gay porn.

==Mission: Pornstar==

Recently, Rob quit MySpace in a [[TL;DR]] diatribe which was <s>the long-anticipated start to his gay porn career</s>, '''it was all an effort to get around 30 very popular YouTube channels deleted, which he managed to by sucking [[YouTube Staff]] cock.'''

Rob has not been sighted since his departure from YouTube and getting those channels deleted. If [[you]] see him, add his link to the '''External Links''' section below.
