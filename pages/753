BCE
[[Image:Bce.gif|thumb|right|Jews do not find this offensive.]]

BCE is an acronym for "Before the Common Era."  The acronym was invented by [[Jews|the Elders of Zion]], [[liberal]]s and/or the [[Illuminati]] to be used in place of "B.C." - which means "Before [[Jesus|Christ]]" - because using Christ's birth to measure time generates too much [[drama]] at conventions.

==Dramatic precision==
[[Obsessive]]s will become mildly dramatic when faced with the term. They feel "BCE" is pointless because it uses the supposed year of Jesus's birth as its reference. Perhaps someday some lucky soul will perform the ultimate absolvement of their own [[White people|white]] [[liberal guilt]] by inventing a calendar completely free of any pesky specific [[God|deities]], [[Animal abuse|red meat]] or references in history.

==Theological drama==
[[Fundamentalist]] Christians are dramatic when discussing the subject. When visiting their forums, insist they use "BCE" at all times. Additional drama can [[flame]] up if you add that your real preference would be to use the Mayan calander, including reviving their custom of human sacrifice.

==Wails of the damned==
[[Atheist]]s radiate drama if they are exposed to the word <i>Christ</i> because they know they are eternally damned by [[teh]] Lord. When dealing with them, always use <i>Before Christ</i> or any other phrase that references Jesus. Make sure you speak in a reverential way, for instance: "I will pray that Christ saves your soul, but you're probably predestined to go to [[Hell]] no matter what, you pathetic sod."
