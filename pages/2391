Of all the questions to ask.<br/>
There's only one that's easy to reply to as well as ask.<br/>
In fact anyone can ask it.<br/>
That question is...cake or death?<br/>

Choose wisely now.<br/>
If you wish to live, choose cake.<br/>
But if you choose death..shame on you.<br/>
Which will you choose?<br/>

Say you're tied up.<br/>
And it's all part of a Xanatos gambit.<br/>
And you have only two choices.<br/>
Which will you go for, cake or death?<br/>

Be careful not to choose death.<br/>
If you wish to live, choose cake.<br/>
You've got two choices.<br/>
So what will it be?  Cake or death?<br/>

You there, cake or death?<br/>
Choose wisely now.<br/>
You wouldn't want death.<br/>
So what will it be?<br/>

Cake please.<br/>
Sorry we are out of cake.<br/>
We only had 3 bits.<br/>
We didn't think it would be such a rush.<br/>

If your life depended on it..<br/>
And the only choices you have..<br/>
Are cake or death.<br/>
Which would you choose?<br/>

One question.<br/>
Two choices.<br/>
Which will it be?<br/>
Cake or death?<br/>

Your life is on the line.<br/>
So answer me this.<br/>
If you had the choice which would you choose?<br/>
Cake or death?}}
