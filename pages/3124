'''''Fullmetal Alchemist''''' is a crazy [[animu]]/[[manga]] about a boy and his robot/metal unicorn.  The original title, ''Love Alchemy'' was dropped when ''[[Love Hina]]'' beat them to the punch.  [[Some argue]] that the main character's titular nickname comes from the fact that he frequently uses the metal shavings lodged in his rectum from [[cock goes where?|fucking his robot brother]] in his alchemy. The series incorporates [[Jersey Shore|science, religion, magic, politics, action and adventure]] to tell a thrilling tale about the [[Rules 1 & 2|First Law]] in alchemy: "[[HOW CAN SHE SLAP?!?|humankind cannot gain anything without giving something in return]]."

==Chapter One: Incestuous Robot Love==
''Full Metal Alchemist'' begins in [[Internet|an alternate Universe, where alchemy can easily turn one thing into another]]. Two [[shotacon|supple, young boys]] called the Elrics try to resurrect their dead mother.  This leads to some rather obvious consequences: the older brother loses an arm, a leg, and another [[penis|limb]], while the younger brother turns into a giant robot. After some [[guro|blood]], [[cum|sweat]] and [[buttsex|tears]], the brothers begin an epic journey to restore their bodies and [[rape|eliminate the Law of Equivalent Exchange]]. 

==Chapter Two: Furries==
[[Image:Furrynina.JPG|thumb|right|Nina is an [[furry]].]]
The seventh (tenth?) episode introduces a [[sick fuck|character]], Tucker, who turns people into [[furries|chimeras]].  Just like real life, teh furries can: talk and understand [[furfaggotry|basic concepts]], hide in [[basement]]s, and eventually die of [[loneliness]]. Tucker then turns his wife into a furry to get money from the government; when said government stopped giving money, he turns his [[loli|four-year-old daughter]] into [[Staredog]]. Another important main character, Scar, [[Islam|blows her up because his religion said so]]. The government steals Tucker again and makes him turn other people into furries to use in [[yiff|war]]. He [[I accidentally X|accidentally]] becomes a furry himself and gets his [[Family Guy|face turned upside down]].  Trying to revive his daughter with alchemy, he gets a [[Josef Fritzl|soul-less]] doll. When asked why by Edward, he proclaims, "I did it for the lulz." And nothing of value was lost.

==Chapter Three: Everyone is Evil==
[[Image:PsirenBoobShot.png|thumb|Edward (debatably) likes [[wimmin|villainesses]].]]
''Fullmetal Alchemist'' questions values by making everyone [[Jewish|evil]]. The Elric brothers kill people to revive their [[tits|mother]] and get their bodies back, the [[personal army|army]] kills people to make the [[Harry Potter|Philosopher's Stone]], A girl introduced in episode one turns up raped and impregnated and tries to come to terms with it by killing people, other people kill people because their [[Allah|religion]] tells them, and the leader of [[Germany|Amestris]] is called '[[Hitler|Fuhrer]]'.  

There are some characters named after the [[Seven's Law|Seven Deadly Sins]]. 'Gluttony' likes to eat [[delicious caek]], 'Lust' speaks seductively and has huge [[GTFO|tits]], 'Envy' is a [[transvestite]], 'Pride' is [[Hitler|Fuhrer]], and Wrath is an [[Randi_Harper|aborted fetus]]. The brothers' dead mother becomes black person, whom Ed must defeat despite the fact that she looks the same as when alive. 'Greed' looks like [[Trent Reznor]] with sharp teeth.

At one point, the Elrics defeat a [[Saddam Hussein|religious dictator]] and kill the faith of all the townspeople, leading them into a spiral of dark [[emo|depression]]. When asked by one little girl why, Edward says 'for great justice.' [[George W. Bush]] was [[fapping|outraged]].

==Chapter Four: Mind-Control==
The only valuable aspect of this series is that it tends to use stock footage involving small children being burnt and shot.

==Chapter Five: [[MOAR]]?==
It was announced [[Last Thursday]] that a new [[animu]] is in production that is [[pix plz|more closely based on the manga]]. Fantards proceeded to shit bricks.

==Anime vs. Anime vs. Manga==
[[Image:Fma_titanic.jpg|thumb| Another [[lulz|historical twist]]]]
[[Nazism|The first anime]] was an epic trolling of weaboos the likes of which no one has ever seen. Very much like fanfiction, the anime was written and produced by [[basement dwellers]]. These people managed to turn a series about [[Naruto|ninja action]] into a historical vendetta. Thus, the entire series can be [[DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS|disregarded]]. The fact that it was even slightly different than the original manga had otakus everywhere [[butthurt|up in arms]], so Square Enix decided to cover their asses by [[fixed|making a new one]] to appease them. 

The new anime [[epic fail|still sucks]].

==Characters==
[[Image:Fullmetal Alchemist Emotions.jpg|thumb|right|''Fullmetal Alchemist'' captures a variety of realistic human emotions.]]
===[[Edward Elric]]===
Main character of the series. Attempts to revive his [[your mom|dead mother]] until one [[guro|alchemy]] session goes wrong and he loses his limbs and [[castration|something else]]. He then burns down his home and joins the army to search for the [[Harry Potter|Philosopher's Stone]] and suck Roy Mustang's cock.

===[[Otherkin|Alphonse Elric]]===
(Secondary main-character) Edward's little brother, who is [[I'm 12 and what is this?|12 years old]]. Srsly. Loves [[pussy|cats]] and [[incest|Ed]]. At the end of the series, actually becomes the Philosopher's Stone, and gets his [[Shotacat|beautiful, young body]] back.

===[[Whore|Winry Rockbell]]=== 
(More Like Winrar Cockbell, [[amirite]]?)
Whore, who would do [[blowjob|anything]] for Ed and Al. Completely useless to the plot, except to help Ed [[fap|screw on his limbs]]. Often [[BDSM|hits him with a wrench]]. Spends most of her life playing with [[masturbation|metal]].

===[[Fag|Roy Mustang]]===
State-Alchemist who thinks he is sexy, but really is only a [[fag]]. Most well known for practicing [[necrophilia]] on Maes Hughes's cold dead body, and yelling about women in skirts.

===[[Dyke|Riza Hawkeye]]===
Lesbian that loves to shoot [[cum|guns]]. Hides the fact she is a carpetmuncher. Covers up her fantasies about scissoring Winry by saying that she has a crush on Roy.

===[[Pedophile|Maes Hughes]]===
Incestuous pedophile that loves to show other people photos about how he raped his daughter. Always finds time to fuck Roy [[buttsecks|on the side]]. His death and funeral are one of the most [[Manly_Tears|BAAWW]]-worthy events in the series.

===[[Nerd|Sceska]]===
Whiny [[basement dweller|bookworm]] who can memorize long [[penises|passages]] in one [[blowjob|read]].

===[[Terrorist|Scar]]===
The [[Wapanese|Japanese authors]] had a ball with this character, giving him a magical [[cock|arm]] which can blow [[Americans|heretics']] insides up with a touch. Has [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|red eyes]], characteristic of his [[Islam|Ishbal]] heritage and [[cult]]ure.

===[[Sex|Lust]]===
Other whore who fanboys [[fap]] to. Has sharp extending fingernails to [[rape|cut]] you with.

===[[Trap|Envy]]===
Trap who can [[Cleverbot|shape-shift]]. Notorious for killing Maes Hughes and causing [[yes|thousands of fangirls to cry]]. Oddly enough, [[irony|he has a shit-ton of fangirls himself]].

===[[Fat|Gluttony]]===
Fatass that eats everything. Literally. He also appears to be [[retard|retarded]].

==The film: The [[Hitler|Conqueror of Shamballah]]==
 [[Image:FMA_Al.jpg|thumb|OH SHI-]]
The [[shit|well-received and critically acclaimed]] film, ''Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballah'', was a complete [[mindfuck]] to any and all viewers mostly due to the fact that Hitler finally made his grand debut. The film vacillates between Amestris, the made-up alchemy world, and Nazi Germany. Viewers are spoonfed the idea that [[divide by zero|one world is a parallel of the other]].

Most notable is the fact that a [[Mel Gibson|movie-making Jew]] saves the day, while a charming [[nigra|gypsy]] provides a tension-filled romance with the otherwise [[gay|shy]] Edward.

To the BAAWWing of many fantards the world over, the film's ending has Ed and Al (now restored to his [[twink]]-like human body) stay in Nazi Germany in order to permanently close [[Goatse|a portal that leads from one magic world to the next]]. This further proves that the series promotes incest as the [[suicide|one, true way]] in matters of [[fags|love]], as Edward easily leaves behind his two lovers, Roy and Winry, back in Amestris.

What the fantards won't get is the Japanese's subtle suggestion that the [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|hydrogen bomb]] was created because parallel-world Nazis needed energy from this world to create a Philosopher's Stone in the next. 

The Illuminati called. They said this was [[truth|bullshit]].
