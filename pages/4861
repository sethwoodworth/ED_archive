'''Lewis Jew''' is a [[pussy-whipped|pro-feminist]], [[neo-con]] [[furry]] [[faggot|pillowbiter]] (although [[Not gay|he denies the last one]]) dedicating his work to reviewing shitty comic books...but who the fuck [[You|gives a shit about comic books,]] [[redundant|really, anyway?]] [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/linkara/at4w/16191-future-five-1 He claims to have a bachelor's in English with a minor in Philosophy], meaning his parents paid for his college education and he had no idea what to do with it. He also claims that makes him a college educated, professional comedian, when in reality just makes him a retard with a useless degree. Hopelessly unfunny and thoroughly convinced he will achieve feminist godhood by endlessly sucking Gail Simone's [[futa|cock]], his videos epically fail on every account - [[Gothzilla|being blessed with a grating voice and the comedic timing of a dead man]]. Ironically, despite claiming to be a [[white knight|bonafide feminist]] (TOW would disagree as proven [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-feminism here]), Lovhaug also claims to be a conservative. When he gets the chance, he tries to make you buy his [[Watchmen]] rip-off comic he made. As his series goes on, he also continues to be [[Truth|agonizingly unlulzy]] due to [[shit|boring-as-fuck source material]], [[fail|missed joke opportunities]], and a storyline as [[old meme|unfunny and uninteresting]] as many of the contributors on the site. Seriously, why the fuck do reviews need stories? They are as bad as [[Truth|porn with stories]].

Also speculated upon is the fact that he actually knows anything at all about comics or that he just bought himself a collection of books like the way [[Irate Gamer]] did by buying himself his game collection from eBay so he could make money on this "original" show concept. As stated several times by himself, Linkara only does this for the money that site brings it, including ranting why the Watchmen movie sucked so he could earn money on trolling the "fans." However, in recent years, it's become quite obvious that he has metamorphosed into one of the contributors who believes that maybe, just maybe, this can turn into a full-time job. An example can be seen [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=GUJj5ZsgA9E here], where he can be seen wiping Spoony's ass and cleaning up the mess when the retarded manchild starting acting like a dick to a fan with a legitimate question. But as this example shows, like a [[slave|good company man]], Linkara rabidly defends even the worst of his co-contributors, including the massive failfag known as [[TheAmazingAtheist|TheDistressedWatcher]]. Furthermore, to ensure his loyalty to Channel Awesome, he had to post that he refused to comment on ThatAussieGuy's canning.

Sadly, Linkara has become quite popular on the site and his rabidly retarded fans quickly cast out any decent comic book reviewer. While it seems the source of the site's cancer comes from Linkara, the combined shit reviewers' failures evidence Linkara's role is minimal. As he studies his co-workers on the site so he can be a part of their clique by example trying to quote the movie Dune with [[Spoony]] and [[Nostalgia Critic]]'s brother, many, many months after Spoony had told about this activity in a video commentary. If you thought Nostalgia Critic calling out the Angry Video Game Nerd into battle to boost his fame was sad, then you should take a good look at Linkara. 

==Potential Furry==

In his [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/linkara/at4w/8982-countdown Countdown Prologue] video at 11 minutes, after getting to a furry character and given the chance to make a joke about furfags, he instead gets butthurt and says the following quote:

"No, I'm not going to make a furry joke. Get over it, Internet! Some people just don't have the same interests as you!"

Not to mention that [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=86&t=15658 his support for the furry fandom is well known on the forum]. Perhaps a bit too well known? Potential lulz may ensue if Linkara actually does turn out to be a [[failure|furfag]].

This is also the most likely reason why he refuses to review 'Sonichu' on his show, because he does not want to insult [[aspergers|his own kind]]  [http://at4w.blip.tv/file/4088888/](Starts around 24:00)

Additionally, in his Angel Armor series he states that the protagonist "Louis" is in love with a "Cat-girl" [http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/angel-armor-yesterday/3637596].  It can't get much more blatant than that.

== Linkara the "Writer" ==

As mentioned before, Linkara has a degree in English. This had led Linkara under the blind impression that he is a writer. Hysterically, Linkara's writing is [[Lulz|worse than his video reviews.]] [http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/angel-armor-yesterday/3637596 Don't believe me? Read the sample pages of Linkara's Angel Armor series.] [[Fanfiction|Note how Linkara insults the reader for not knowing obscure Greek mythology, fails at recapping what has happened in the last books, and uses rape to induce drama, and has a catwomen (who can magiks) as his self-insert's girlfriend.]] Truly that English degree has cultivated a [[Sarcasm|truly great writer!]] Another thing to note is how Linkara writes for [http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainscanstudios/2838527484/in/photostream/ 2] [http://lightbringer.comicgenesis.com/ web-comic] books at the same time. There is a [http://www.drunkduck.com/Crossoverlord/index.php third web-comic] book Linkara is only peripheral in it as a [[crossover]]. This suggests Linkara is an "all-work-no-play" kind of guy who constantly spews shit, possibly explaining how he got Iron Liz since Linkara probably can't be bothered going more than 15 minutes out of his basement since [[Serious Business|HE HAS IMPORTANT COMICZ B00KS TO WRITEZ!!1!!]] And no. Not a single one of them is good. The [[Lulz|saddest]] part is that through all his posturing as some sort of [[nerd|comic-book critic]] with [[vagina|taste]] and [[crybaby|level-headed sensibilities]] he's just another piece of public-hosted [[webcomic]] runoff that got lucky.  

'''Revolution Of The Mask'''
A really bad ''1984'' rip-off mixed with ''Watchmen'' with a hint of ''The Dark Knight Returns''. Revolution Of The Mask is also where Linkara uses his useless Philosophy minor to spew nonsense. Linkara, being the borderline retarded feminist he is, [[Awesome|depicts women being forced to give men sex]] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainscanstudios/2837693917/in/photostream/ at any and] all times when asked, as if to warn people OF THIS IS WHERE SOCIETY IS HEADING!!eleven!1!!! [http://watermark.drivethrustuff.com/pdf_previews/64008-sample.pdf The protagonist is abducted] by a Rorschach rip-off, a Wonder Women rip-off, and a ninja who are all conveniently the world's first superheros. Linkara had to go through [http://atopfourthwall.blogspot.com/search/label/Revolution%20of%20the%20Mask three artist] in order to get even two issues released, with one of them just altogether disappearing on him. 

[[sarcasm|What a great business man]].

'''Lightbringer'''
A truly epic piece of lulz when looking at his earliest [http://lightbringer.comicgenesis.com/d/20060315.html pieces of MS paint drawings.] Linkara would eventually hire out [[DeviantArt|an 'actual' artist]] in order to throw money away at a comic [[Noone|NO ONE]] reads. The story is about the first superhero in the world (again) who is essentially Bruce Wayne but with some vague powers. There really isn't a story here outside of tasteless cruel acts against women. The goons of [[Something Awful|Something Awful]] had a [http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3279023&perpage=40&pagenumber=198#post385019439 field day] with his shitty comic on multiple occasions and [http://lightbringer.comicgenesis.com/news/2007/09/for-those-from-somethingawful-or-ywib.html Linkara took it to heart.]

[http://chitownsveryown.blogspot.com/ Here is a more step by step review of the Lightbringer (you mean Lucifer, amirite?) comic.]

'''Crossoverlord'''

What-lord?

{{clear}}

== History of Power Rangers ==

[[Image:Linkaragaycumdaddies.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Man Children.]]

As a side project Linkara likes to sperg out about his favorite [[Wapanese | wapanese]] show as a kid that was severely butchered and no where near as good as [[Rider Kick|Kamen Rider.]] Here he critiques each series like fine wine or a classic piece of american literature. He also goes out of his way to buy official props used on the show as said by copycat dealers making a fast buck on this retard at comic cons.

In November 2010 Linkara's recent update about the series started off with [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/linkara/hopr/28574-power-rangers-wild-force a 6 minute butt hurt statement] driven at his fan base. He claims that he was busy being jobless, attending conventions, and filming the worst thing imaginable next to Kickassia. [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/linkara/at4w/28226-silent-hill-deadalive-5  (the horror starts at 22 minute mark)] Lewis apparently doesn't understand how to make a short message about his future work being put on hiatus, and gets a huge uproar of fan backlash from his pure ignorance. Furthermore, he probably should have been far less bitchy about this update, but nobody really [[truth|gives that much of a shit]] about his "History of the Power Rangers" series to tell him this.

==Iron Liz (Linkara's <s>Boy</s>Girlfriend)==

[[Image:Nightmarefueliz.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Iron Liz,<br>The only [[man|girl]] Linkara could get.]]
[[File:CWCSweetTransvestite.JPG|thumb|right|Iron Liz,  Pre-Op.]]

{{warning|IRON LIZ MAY ACTUALLY BE [[Invisible Crane|INVISIBLE CRANE]] BEFORE OR AFTER THE SEX CHANGE,<br>WE CAN'T ACTUALLY TELL WHICH WAY AROUND!!!}}

'''Iron Liz''' is Linkara's [[Girlfriend|girlfriend]], though the [[Tranny|girl part]] is debatable. Linkara introduced us to this [[Sarcasm|beautiful flower]] by having her host two of [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/linkara/at4w/25170-ewoks-9 his] [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/linkara/at4w/24707-chain-gang-war-1 episodes.] To no one's surprise, these videos were bombarded by [[Truth|"hateful" comments]] since she failed to be nearly as [[sarcasm|lulzy]] as Linkara. Ironically, he wrote these episodes, which makes you wonder even more about his [[fail|abilities as a writer]]. This stunt proved to be so unsuccessful, in fact, that some fans are still [[lulz|praising teh lawd]] that Iron Liz did not return to review another crappy comic.

{{quote|Finally, no more Iron whatever the hell her name is... good ol' Linkara.|
See: Fact.}}

[[File:Linkaratrannygf.jpg|thumb|left|"I stuck my infant penis inside of that beast!?"]]
[[File:IronLizinaBikini.jpg|thumb|right|Who needs a chastity belt?<br>After seeing Iron Liz in a bikini bra,  you'll never have an erection ever again!]]


Of course, the Geico Caveman (seriously, look at her manly forehead) wrote a [http://thefoundary.blogspot.com/2010/06/i-dont-get-sad-i-get-pissed-response-to.html butthurt entry on her site] all about this detailing how she will "CUT YOUR BELLY OPEN" because she is pissed that fans (rightfully) complained about her lackluster effort and actually [[lulz|blaming her boyfriend for most of the problems that she had with her cameos]]. [[BAWW|BAWWW]]. Thanks to the TGWTG's wankary, however, Iron Liz decided to make her own review show of [[RPG|RPG games.]] Wait, you thought she reviewed [http://blip.tv/file/3840061 video] [http://blip.tv/file/3730081 games?] [[HA! HA! Guy|No, she reviews table top RPGs, like Dungeon and Dragons.]] That's right. Iron Liz decided to review '''the most obscure and useless of all things ever''', taking <s>Boring Lame</s> [[loser|Board James]]'s [[fail|award-winning]] concept of reviewing board games and making it [[over 9000|so much worse]]. Iron Liz even takes after Spoony with [[boring|long fucking blogs]] about what [http://blip.tv/file/3745571 a big poopy head her boss is] including [http://blip.tv/file/3917577 this horrifying piece of work.] '''WARNING: THIS VIDEO WILL FUCK OUT YOUR BRAINS''' (skip to 6 minutes in unless you like hearing about [[dickgirl|her]] fucking family and how much she hates them).
It should also be noted, that after (s)he appeared in Linkara's show, the fans were immediately confused about her gender, thus she ended up making sad videos where she [[whore|wore only her bra and had camera focused on her cleavage]]. All of this just to prove that she indeed is a woman (and in hopes that some sad fucks would [[unrealistic expectations|fap to her]]).

Speaking of [[Spoony]], she [http://blip.tv/file/3954818 immediately flew off the handle when Spoony made a gay joke in one of his videos.] She then proceeded to rage, much to the indifference of everyone else. 

[[Man The Harpoons|Again, What a great catch Linkara got!!!]]

Unfortunately for all of humanity, [http://at4w.blip.tv/file/4201378/ the two have recently moved in with each other.] [[You|Humanity]] weeps for the future.
