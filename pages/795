Backmasking
The art of listening to [[music]] backwards, this is rumored to be the only real way of finding Satan and/or the Colonel's secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices. Perhaps the only good way of listening to music; if you do not praise Satan (e.g. non-Jew) by the end of listening to a Beatles song backwards there is something morally wrong with [[you]] and if you infuriate the dark lord enough he will jump out of the song and take your lucky charms.

It should be noted that some artists have backmasked songs for the [[lulz]] (see Pink Floyd). Iron Maiden and Judas Priest both did it for the lulz but failed. Queen's [[fail|attempt]] at the lulz was a simple message of smoking weed.
