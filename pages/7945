On October 7, 2007, [[old media|CBS News's ''60 Minutes Sunday'']] included an interview in [[Switzerland|Geneva]] with [[party Van|Interpol]] Secretary General Ron Noble who made the [[liberal|libtard]] point that Interpol is supposedly underfunded because the [[U.S.]] doesn't want [[Why do you hate America?|Iran and Cuba]] to access its intelligence. To emphasize the point of the supposed lack of funding, the program showed a swirled photographic portrait of a then unidentified [[Canadia]]n serial [[irish282|child molester]], that was swirled back by a colleague of [[Irish]] Interpol [[Internet detective]] Mick Moran ([http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/04/60minutes/main3330289.shtml see transcript]).  After the ''60 Minutes Sunday'' program, the news of the photograph spread to [[old media|other news outlets]], and '''Swirl Face''' was [[abortion|born]].

Over many years, the [[Gary Glitter|gentleman pederast]] ''a.k.a'' '''Swirl Face''' had distributed via the [[12chan|internet]] over [[300]] photographs of himself having [[sex|sexual congress]] with [[over 9000|a number of]] boys as young as six years old in [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]]. '''Swirl Face''' had assumed his [[IRL]] identity was safe as he had digitally obscured his face. Unfortunately, (for him at least) he demonstrated that his skillz at touching up [[13 year old boy]]s were better than his skillz in [[photomanip|photoshop]], foolishly using the "twirl" tool on the area around his face in the image (making it look something akin to a colorful [[asshole]]), instead of simply blurring or blacking it out the image. The police, using their keen deductive powers, twirled the photo in the opposite direction, and revealed this [[sick fuck]]'s face to the world.

[[b|/b/]] quickly discovered the [[lulz|lulzy]] before-and-after photos, and the legend of Swirl Face was born. <s>Now it falls to [[anonymous]] to identify this weeaboo [[AZN]]-fetish motherfucker before he can [[pwn|strike again]].</s> <s>LOL identified.</s> '''ARRESTED!'''

==October 19 Swirly Update - BUSTED!==

[[Image:Vico.jpg|thumb|155px|Not the question he should have asked himself.]]

[[Image:Swirlbear.jpg|thumb|left|145px|[[Pedobear|Who]] could that be?]]

Thanks to the publicity something like [[over 9000|350]] snitches dropped a dime and his [[dox]] - the Swirly name, date of birth, passport number, and job have all been discovered. Swirl Face has been identified as '''Christopher Paul Neil''', a [[theredskull|Canadian]] English language teacher formerly employed in [[South Korea]]. 

'''Expert boy toucher Neil is now busted!''' Monsieur Swirly was [[pwned]] today by a trace on the mobile phone of his 25-year-old [[Thai]] [[boyfriend]], identified by transvestites in a seedy rural town called Pattaya. The Swirl-meister is now just that much closer to biting the pillow during his well-deserved and daily prison [[rape|ass-poundings]] from [[Bubba]].

==Sentencing: August 15, 2008==

A Thai court sentenced Swirlyman to three years in prison for sexually abusing a [[13 year old boy]]. He still has [[MOAR]] trials to come for his numerous [[raep]]s of other [[victim]]s, including the first boy's 9 year old brother. The court also imposed a fine of 60,000 Thai Baht (around $2,000) - bad touching is an expensive hobby.
