'''Texas''', the second [[Fat|largest]] state in the [[America|Union]], is a hellhole best known for shitty [[earrape|country music]], morbidly obese people, Megachurches, its inability to contribute anything of value to the country, McMansions, Bible Thumpers, sedentary lifestyle, super-sized portions drenched in lard, [[Dr. Phil|Dr. Phool]], George W. Bush, a [[correct|questionable]] point of view on people, and its attempts to outlaw gays. Texas wants to be a separate nation, but it's being overtaken by Mexicans, so that goes to tell ya how much they suck dick. Other than that, they suck major fucking cockles because they call themselves the fucking "lone-star" state, in other words, [[tits or GTFO]]. Texas represent everything that is wrong in humanity. 

Unlike California and Seattle, Texas' [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|USI syndrome]] is caused primarily by ignorance. A typical Texan believes that Texas is absolutely the best place in the world because he's never been anywhere outside of his rural shithole. Therefore when Texans move to Coastal regions they adopt [[Liberalism|liberal]] values and vigorously troll their state of origin. But to locals they still remain backwards country dumbshits.

[[Some argue]] that Texas is the number one killer of [[retarded|ordinary]] people, but we all [[George W. Bush|know better than that]].

== How To Troll a Texan ==
*If you're an [[Arizona]]n, make sure they hear you wondering aloud what kind of gay-ass state requires people to have a permit to carry a handgun and requires you to keep it out of sight. 
*Call them a [[Liberal]], as all Texans believe that being a liberal is the most contemptible thing on the planet (besides being not Texan).
*Tell them that [[Alaska]] is bigger and [[California]] has more people, forcing them to accept that they will always be second best.
*Ask them who won the battle at the Alamo.  
*Tell them that Texas is a "gay friendly" state. This will enrage most Texans, as they will assume that you are calling them gay.
*Remind them how their shitty [[baseball]] team got their ass kicked in the World Series by a bunch of pot smoking [[hippies]] from [[San Francisco]].
*Philosophically announce that Dale Earnhardt <del>Jr.</del> did it to himself and maybe deserved it.
*Steal the dangling metal ballsack off of their trailer hitch on their truck, or draw nipples on them. [[Srsly]]. They have them.
*Explain to them in full detail just why and how [[country music]] is the worst thing to ever happen to mankind.
*Tell them you voted for [[Obama]], and support abortion rights for women.
*Tell them you support ''any'' rights for women.
*Ask any random person if you can still get Medicaid if you don't have a social security number.
*Best of all, you can just send them to [http://doom3.zoy.org doom3.zoy.org] (you'll be sohhreee..). It's like shooting rednecks in a corral. 
*Ask someone where the nearest gay bar is.
*Tell them that you're from the ATF and you are here to take their guns. (WARNING!! THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS TROLLING TECHNIQUE ON THE LIST. IF YOU DO THIS, YOU WILL BE FACING AN ARMY OF VERY PISSED OFF TEXANS ARMED TO THE TEETH! DO NOT ATTEMPT UNLESS WEARING BODY ARMOR AND CARRYING AT LEAST AN ASSAULT RIFLE. LIGHT MACHINE GUN IS RECOMMENDED.) 
*Announce loudly pretty much anywhere that you support medical insurance and equal rights for illegal immigrants.
*Tell them where you're from, people don't eat live castrated male oxen smothered in BBQ sauce.
*Wear a giant foam cowboy hat everywhere. Spit a lot, and speak in grunts only.
*Tell them Whataburger and/or [[Faggot|Dairy Queen]] is/are the shittiest restaurant(s) you've ever been to.
*Tell them that their state doesn't produce anything apart from oil and Nascar fans.
*Remind them of how poorly they fought in the Civil War (not at all)
*Tell them Lone Star Beer sucks.
*Accuse them of owning a Hybrid car
*Tell them that the Dallas Cowboys are worse than the Detroit Tigers.
*Defile any and all Baptist churches and other religious material. (Ex: Lawn ornament is cross that reads "He Is Risen!" Take Magic Marker and write "No, he just fell off the cross"/"o rly"/"k where is he?", etc.)
*Tell a Texan that you are a follower of a religion/denomination other than [[Fucktards|Baptism]] or [[Sick fuck|Catholicism]]. Large number of [[Spics]] and white suburbanites present will increase lulz tenfold. 
*At 3 o'clock in the morning, go and steal the off road tires and/or rims off of their truck, [[Fail|which they only use to take the Gulf Freeway into work from their overpriced McMansion in Clear Lake]]. This will punch a massive hole in their ego.
* Inform them that if Alaska was split in half, Texas would be the THIRD biggest state.
