'''Duane Lee "Dog" Chapman'''  is a [[psychopath|bounty hunter]] and bail bondsman who lives to fuck with [[Redundant|stupid]] niggers. He stars in ''Dog the Bounty Hunter'', a weekly reality television program which is currently broadcast to racist white people.

In 1977, [[Redneck|Chapman]] was sentenced to five years in a Texas prison following a conviction on charges of the first degree murder of Jerry Oliver. He was released on probation after serving less than two years of fucking your dad. He maintains his innocence in the murder.

Dog is notable for being a [[racist]], his [[Fail|inability]] to use the [[internets]] and for fucking your mother. Also, his [[Pig|wild hambeast]] wife has [[Do not want|giant tatters]] and he believes that [[Margaret Thatcher]] is still the Prime Minister of [[United Kingdom|Brittanistan]].

==You're a Racist!==

In October of [[2007]], Duane Chapman made [[lol|racially insensitve remarks]] during a taped conversation with his son, Tucker, including the word "black person" when referring to his son's black girlfriend, [[Sheneequa|Monique]] Shinnery. Tucker replied by [[pwnt|selling his dad out]] to the ''National Enquirer'' for 15k and some [[vagina|negro pussy]]. Subsequently, a bunch of [[insane|crazed]] [[No life|activists]] called for Chapman's popular show to be canceled. A&E has since suspended production for the series, pending an investigation.

Chapman issued a public statement apologizing for his "regrettable use of very inappropriate language". Chapman also claimed that the statements were [[Bullshit|"taken out of context"]] and that he was "disappointed in his [son's] choice of a friend, [[Not racist|not due to her race]], but her character."

He also went onto to say, he only "hated [[Niggers|some black people]]" and not all.

==You fucking scum nigger without a soul==
{{quote|Duane "Dog" Chapman: I don't care if she's a Mexican, a whore or whatever. It's not because she's black, it's because we use the word nigger sometimes here. I'm not gonna take a chance ever in life of losing everything I've worked for for 30 years because some fucking nigger heard us say ni**er and turned us in to the Enquirer magazine. Our career is over! I'm not taking that chance at all! Never in life! Never! Never! If Lyssa [Dog's daughter] was dating a nigger, we would all say 'fuck you!' And you know that. If Lyssa brought a black guy home ya da da... it's not that they're black, it's none of that. It's that we use the word nigger. We don't mean you fucking scum nigger without a soul. We don't mean that shit. But America would think we mean that. And we're not taking a chance on losing everything we got over a racial slur because our son goes with a girl like that. I can't do that Tucker. You can't expect Gary, Bonnie, Cecily, all them young kids to [garbled] because 'I'm in love for 7 months' - fuck that! So, I'll help you get another job but you can not work here unless you break up with her and she's out of your life. I can't handle that shit. I got 'em in the parking lot trying to record us. I got that girl saying she's gonna wear a recorder...|Dog tells it like it is}}

{{quote|In Hawaii, we have something called [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|Ho'oponopono]], where people come together to resolve crises and restore peace and balance. I am meeting with my spiritual advisor, Rev. Tim Storey [[OMG|(he's black)]], and hope to [[gangbang|meet with other black leaders]] so they can see who I really am and teach me the right thing to do to make things right, again...|Dog}}
