Screamo
[[File:BMTH_fags.jpg|thumbnail|right|A bunch of fucking faggots that take shits into their instruments, teenage scene girls ignore their terrible sound (call it "screamo") and listen to them for the way they look. [[lie|Best reason for anything done in existance!!111]]]]

'''Screamo''' is a form of music typically listened to by [[scene|scenes]] and [[emos]] while [[loser|cutting their wrists and bitching about how hard their pathetic lives are]]. Screamo bands can be seperated into two main groups: [[fail|emo kids who decided to start their own band]], and [[black metal]] bands whos guitarists quit. Screamo music can be identified by the lack of any sort of tune, and the abundance of white kids screaming at the top of their lungs so that you can't actually hear a fucking thing they're saying. Some people think that this loud noise actually classifies as music. [[fact|These people are faggots.]]

== Lyrics ==

Screamo songs can be easilly identified by their self hating lyrics about killing themselves and how much they want to die. The lyrics generally attempt to show how depressed the band really is inside. Really, screamo lyrics are just written by [[attention whore|emo faggots who talk about killing themselves in every fucking song because they're so depressed,]] but have never actually hardened the fuck up and done it.

This track would be better without the vocals. Almost tolerable as a prog rock number.

Take note of the guitarist in the beginning. He has some [[Crabcore|serious moves!]]
