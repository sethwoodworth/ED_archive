Two of my friends died
An [[unfunny]] (fuck you, two of my friends died thinking it was funny) meme originating on [[Digg]] that consists of placing the phrase "Fuck You, two of my friends died" before an activity that two of your friends were presumably doing when they died. Started when some [[13-year-old boy|user]] got all [[butthurt]] about somebody making fun of [[school shooting|school shootings]]. 

===[[Typical]] usage:===
*Fuck You, two of my friends died editing [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].

==See Also==
*[[My mom just died]]
*[[Dead Friend]]
*[[But you are died!]]
*[[Thats not funny, my brother died that way]]
*[[Peter Jennings died, so I'm going to quit smoking]]
