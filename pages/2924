Fibromyalgia
[[Image:Pedobear for fibromialgia.jpg|thumb|'''Fibromyalgia bear:''' Symbol of hope or [[Pedobear]] in disguise?]]

'''Fibromyalgia''' is another fake [[Disease|medical problem]] invented as a joint collaboration between [[lazy]] [[women]], unethical doctors, drug [[addicts]] and the Jew pharmaceutical industry. Like [[Laziness|Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]], [http://www.AIDSisover.com AIDS] and [[cancer]], fibromyalgia is essentially a fancied up way of saying "doing stuff makes me tired, give me some [[money]] and/or [[drugs]]". Claiming to suffer from it is a common tactic used by [[Niggers|the lazy]] in their quest to achieve the [[American]] dream of [[Welfare|getting paid by the gub'ment to never go to work]] and get loads of free [[drugs]].

The fact that the medical community doesn't have their shit together well enough to classify fibromyalgia as a [[disease]] or a [[disorder]] is telling enough. Fibromyalgia is not a disease defined by any real pathology or etiology but is rather defined by an aggregate of [[bullshit|symptoms]] that include: [[laziness|tiredness]], [[laziness]], [[apathy|lacklusterness]], [[Sloth|sluggishniss]], [[Unfunny|lolessness]], [[Obesity|fatassedness]], [[Crybaby|whininess]], [[Pain|soreness]] and [[fail]].  Many people on teh [[internets]] claim to have fibromyalgia and are very defensive about it because deep down they know they are just faking it and can therefore be [[Lolcow|easily milked]] for moderate-to-high-quality lulz.  The best way to achieve this is to say things like: ''"I'm not saying you '''know''' that you're faking it, but..."'' and then explain to them why it is obvious that they are gaming the system so that they can stay home, pop pills and get sympathy for their "suffering" on teh webs.

== [[Profit]]ing from Fibromyalgia ==

One of the best things about fibromyalgia is that it can score you some [[EXTREME|intensely powerful]] prescription [[drugs]]. If you are into, or will settle for, benzodiazepines or low-grade painkillers, even mentioning fibromyalgia can get them for you. If you want [[Drug#Oxycontin|the]] [[Amphetamine|good]] [[Barbiturate|shit]], all you need is a formal diagnosis. 

Do not be afraid to go [[Wikipedia:Doctor shopping|doctor shopping]] until you get the drugs you so desperately <strike>need</strike> want -- everyone else with a fibromyalgia diagnosis is doing the same, only they're too [[delusional]] to realize it. All you need to do is go to a doctor and complain of fatigue, generalized pain and and overall [[fail]]y feeling.  If this does not work [[BAW|just]] [[BAWWW|keep]] [[BAWWWWW|whining]] until they diagnose you.  If you need tips on how to seem whiny and faily you can watch [[Peppermintpatti|The Italin Stallionette's]] videos on [[YouTube]] (check tags for ''fibromyalgia''); follow this simple advice and the sweet, sweet [[Addiction|profit]] will soon be yours.

If you've already been doctor shopping but are too [[Mentally retarded|intellectually insufficient]] to get the good shit, just mix whatever ones you ''do'' get with [[booze]] and [[weed]] and [[Dextromethorphan|cough syrup]] and ''voila!'' you will be completely mindless and ready for hours of trawling through [[old memes]] and countless hours of [[sxephil|really really really shitty videos]] on the webs.

'''PROTIP:''' Try to avoid legitimate doctors, as they may see through your [[bullshit]] and give you antidepressants. These will ''not'' get you high and in the unlikely event that you are a man, they will give you [[erectile dysfunction]]. Flush them down the toilet, give them to your dog, or sell them to some [[emo]] kids.
