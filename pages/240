MY Boycott against BET and Black History Month

Because of my last blog, and all the wonderful feedback
I got..it made me think...

This is gonna be hard guys. I LOVE the comedians on BET. I also LOVE 
the fact that they play my favorite show of all time, In Living Color. 
However, I do not believe in seperating ANY RACE in America. WE ARE AMERICANS!
How dare we have Black History Month! In my eyes, the Native Americans deserve
it MUCH more, seeing how we destroyed their ENTIRE SOCIETY. There are hardly any 
of them left! They also have been proven to have the WORST living conditions on 
their reservations. I want AN AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH. One where we learn about 
EVERY race, ALL OF OUR LEADERS, EVERYONE! I think by having a month dedicated 
to one race, and not one for any other, is RACIST. Every fund set up to only help
people of one race is SICK and RACIST.

Yes, I get it. Black people were slaves here once. You know what? That does 
suck some major balls, however, it is time to move the fuck on. Do we hear the 
Jews crying that they were made slaves for thousands of years? Do we hear them 
whine that they should OWN the pyramids in Egypt because THEY broke their backs 
making them? Do we hear them bitch and moan about Hitler, etc? (my hubby is a Jew)
Nope, we dont. It's time for us to UNITE AS ONE. I do not think that singling out 
one race, giving one race opportunities to go to college (I know a TON of poor white.
asian, indian, american indian, etc etc that could use that too!), giving one race 
the EXCUSE to blame things on others for being whatever nationality they are, is a 
good way at making sure we NEVER kill racism.

I am over this shit. WE ALL CAME FROM ONE BLACK WOMAN FROM AFRICA, THAT is our EVE! It
has been proven by science, and I stand by it. If any other race had a chanel dedicated
to just them, we would think it was racist. If any other race demanded a month be set aside
for ONLY them, they would be considered racist. I am NOT living by this double standard any longer.

Think I am racist? I am not. I know what racism is. I dated a guy named "Justin" in Junior 
high. Nothing serious, but I really liked him. He was the blackest of black...BEAUTIFUL skin, 
kinda like Alex Wek's. He was handsome, and athletic, etc. I was called a nigger lover. But 
you know what? I was called that by a whole 2 people out of a school with HUNDREDS of students.
THAT is why I am NOT buying this racist shit anymore. Let us teach or children that there is 
NO DIFFERENCE! We are all human. I hope one day aliens land and try to kill us. Maybe THEN we
would finally realize that WE are ONE.

So, I will no longer tune into BET. This is going to suck, but I do NOT like the idea of having
a chanel for only 1 race. In the year 2007 in a country that is supposed to be the most 
advanced and equal. This is unexceptable! I will also no longer acknowledge Black History Month.
Instead, I will see it the way that Morgan Freeman does (I have the quote at the bottom of my 
last blog on Obama/jesseJackson, and OJ). AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH! I will read/watch/and learn 
about ALL the people who made a difference in this country.

I am asking you ALL to join me. Black, White, Indian, Asian, Russian, Australian, etc etc.....
lets be AMERICANS together! What happened to the African American community was AMERICAN HISTORY,
not BLACK HISTORY. If you want to celebrate in a way that excludes others and singles one race
out, count me the FUCK out! I am soooo proud to be an American. I am SO proud that I have friends
of every race, and none of us see each other as anything but what we are..people. Lets change 
Black History Month to 2 months of AMERICAN HISTORY. We will still learn about all the black 
leaders and people who made a difference....just not with the racist name of "Black History Month".
It has to start somewhere. I am going to do my part in making sure we are all treated EQUAL in 
a country that CLAIMS we are. NO MORE SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR ANYONE WITH ANYTHING!

It will never happen. At least, that is what many of you will say...FINE! My number one priority
here is being able to die and know that I stood up for what I believed in, and that I did not 
add to the SEPERATION OF AMERICANS!! I love my country, I love the people in it. I love our history,
good and bad. We should LEARN from it,not dwell in it and not move forward. That's why I am done 
with this shit. You are all my brothers and sisters.....even if I think you suck ; )   As Bono said,
"One life, with each other..sisters...brothers!"

now, have fun burning me at the stake ; )
