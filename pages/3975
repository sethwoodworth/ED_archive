Image Hosting
[[Image:Flickr-emo_example.jpg|thumb|300px|Typical Flickr user]]
'''Image hosting''' sites are the [[goatse|unholy spawn]] of [[social networking sites]] like [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]] who made [[hotlinking]] a crime [[at least 100 years ago]]. All are free and as such you get [[crap|what you pay for]]. When you've maxed-out your free allocation, you can pay a premium for more...or you can sign up at all the sites and never pay shit.

[[pix|Image]] hosting sites come in three main flavours: shit ('''Photobucket'''), shittier ('''ImageShack''') and arty shit ('''Flickr'''). All provide the basic service of allowing you to upload your [[n00dz]] and letting [[B|/b/tards]] get a [[Angela Sazanow‎|look-see]] since all are about as secure and air-tight as [[Lisa Ventura]]'s hymen.


__TOC__


==Flickr==
'''Flickr''' is much like Photobucket or ImageShack except way more pretentious. It is designed primarily to help [[16-year-old girl]]s share photos of their [[Cutting|self-mutilation]] and also the nice tree they have in their backyard. And maybe a kitty. Awww.

If you are permitted to create a Flickr account, then you are probably the best photographer ever and deserve lots of warm fuzzies in the form of "Best Dish Drain Photo of the Hour" awards posted on the photo's comment thread. Wealthy and powerful people may even have "Flickr Pro" accounts, which enable them to post as many self-mutilation shots as they can take.

Any photos of a Flickr user posted on Flickr will exhibit severe symptoms of [[Internet Disease]]. Photos of other people will be in black and white and focus on their mascara running.

It is a popular place for [[pedos]] and other [[sick fucks]] to hang out, as they can favourite and browse family photos of [[13 year old boys]], [[jailbait]] and [[loli]] then proceed to [[fap]] like crazy.

==Photobucket==
'''Photobucket''' is a website that serves as the single largest repository of pictures and graphics for the [[MySpace]] pages of [[attention whore]]s, [[stripper]]s and [[pr0n]]stars everywhere along with their legion of [[perv|horny fans]] saying '''"thanks for the add"'''   or '''"popping by to show some luv"'''. If Photobucket were to explode, the world would be covered in hearts, stars and glitter. It is also giant bucket of lulz due to the [[CS3|easy access]] it gives the [[1337]] [[h4x0r5]] on the likes of [[B|/b/]] [[troll]]ing for [[camwhore]] drama (see: [[Angela Sazanow‎]], [[Klutzypriss07|Tiffani Perez]]).

Also useful for storing <strike>[[CP]]</strike> hilarious image macros, since bandwidth is plentiful and storage space is generous. It also has many [[crap|nifty]] features like slide-shows that help crash your browser if you're unlucky enough to get [http://comment.myspace.com/Modules/Comments/Pages/ViewComments.aspx??fuseaction=user.viewComments&friendID=179097219 MySpacerolld].

Recently [[last Thursday]], photobucket has started to baleet anything that is porn, related to pron, shows tits or anything along those lines, [[Nazi|anti-semitic]], racially offensive, [[furfag|anything that might offend another political or social party]] and many more bullshit. They also bar the posting of [[Pedobear]] which is already shitty in it's own right. If you want to keep the [[moralfags]] from ruining your fun simply click account settings and set your album to private.

==Fuskering==

Even if a Photobucket account is locked, the individual links to each photo will still work perfectly. If only someone [http://solo1.hostrator.com/pf.rar had a program] that could take advantage of this by, say, running an automatic number crunch on all common files names (like DSC00001, or IMG_0001, or Photo0001, etc.) and then dumping them into a folder.

Let's say someone takes a photo of themself, and you accidentally right-click Properties and notice that her Photobucket is "xxx". OHNOES! It's [http://s37.photobucket.com/albums/e100/xxx/ locked]! Wat do?

1. Download [http://solo1.hostrator.com/pf.rar simple iteration program]

2. Type in details (in this case xxx)

3. Make yourself a [[drug|cup of tea]].

4. ?????

5. Profit!

Now you just pick one [[tits|at random]] and post it. If she ignores it, the [[lulz]] die here and you should move on. However, if she asks you to stop, then you must keep going. It's [[Waaaambulance|traditional]].

==ImageShack==
'''ImageShack''' is a much shittier image host, as evidenced by its users always exceeding their allotted bandwidth and getting the [[lulz]]y placeholder image with a [[frog]] on it.  It was also hacked recently by the "Anti-Sec Movement", a group of [[Internet Tough Guy|concerned citizens]] who believe "no news is good news" to the [[extreme]].  Their plan is to "[[own]] everyone and everything".  More on that can be found [http://www.softsailor.com/news/5763-imageshack-hacked-by-the-anti-sec-movement-more-to-follow.html here].

==Imgur==
'''Imgur''' is the only good thing that has ever came about due to [[Reddit]]. It is currently the only decent free image host, and provides a simple way for you to upload all your [[Goatse|gay porns]] without having to worry about bandwidth limits. Unlike other image hosts that are full of [[faggotry]], Imgur is as simple as:
 
1. [[Push butan]]

2. Select [[Goatse|image]]

3. Push upload.
