The Fidel Castro El Zol Prank
{{warning|This article contains [[over 9000|a lot]] of the moon language known as [[Spanish]]}}
The [[troll]]ing and resultant [[pwnage]] of random [[lusers]] [[OTI]] is a mainstay of internet culture and [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] in general. Sometimes, however, trolls are so great and [[lulz]] so [[epic]] that one is able to occasionally [[troll]] world leaders resulting in a total [[lollercaust]]. This is one of those occasions. 

== The Setup ==
[[Image:CastrolessthanthreeChavez.jpg|thumb|Castro and Chavez, just prior to butt burglin']]
Mexican and [[beaner|Joe Ferrero]] first came to America aboard a small raft after setting sail from Cuba. Upon arriving in America they were granted immediate citizen status because everyone knows Cubans are a higher grade of Mexican than Mexicans. 

They became disc jockeys for the popular [[Spanish]] language radio station [[bix nood|El Zol]] in [[Miami]] [[Florida]]. There they would enact their plan to gain revenge for the years of constant [[pwnage]] their families endured while living in Cuba. 

In January 2003, they managed to use their [[1337]] [[troll]] skills of [[bullshit]] and [[social engineering]] to [[troll]] [[Hugo Chavez]] live on their show, proving that you can indeed troll a troll. However, since [[Hugo Chavez]] had not yet reached [[legendary ruin status]], [[shit nobody cares about|nobody gave a shit]]. They did however manage to [[chat log|record]] their conversation with Chavez and create a soundboard of him, which would prove critical in the next phase of their operations. 

In the interim, both [[Hugo Chavez]] and [[Fidel Castro]] attended some [[leftard]] [[communism|commie]] conference together in [[Argentina]] with other Mexicans where they had furious [[buttsecks]] together without protection. Chavez was also forced to endure a [[Roman Shower]] from the elderly and more senior Cuban leader.

== The Call ==

On June 18, 2003, Ferrero and Santos called up Castro's office posing as Chavez's aides, and claiming that [[Hugo Chavez|Chavez]] was on the phone with them and needed to talk about [[serious business|sensitive issues]] with Castro. After all, they had Chavez's voice to back it up. [[retard|Castro's staff]] immediately put through who they thought was Chavez to Castro. 

On the phone with [[Fidel Castro]], Ferrero and Santos explained that Chavez was concerned because he had left a briefcase with [[dongs|sensitive materials]] in Argentina and wanted to know if Castro or his men had picked it up, and asked him to do an investigation into it. Castro agreed, at which point Ferrero and Santos dropped the charade. They called Fidel a scumbag and informed him that [[YHBT|he had been trolled]]. 

[[Fidel Castro|Fidel]] became [[butthurt]] and started acting like a [[internet tough guy|tough guy]], calling Ferrero and Santos [[faggots]] and telling them to [[fuck]] [[your mom|their moms]]. Since Ferrero and Santos are from [[Miami]], Castro was probably correct that they are [[fgts]]. Nevertheless, [[epic]] [[lulz]] ensued for Ferrero and Santos and their audience of Cubans who hate Castro because he robbed them of [[hookers and blow]].

== The Fallout ==
In April 2004, [[The Man|the FCC]] fined El Zol $4,000 for the prank. This makes no sense as [[America|AmeriKKKa]] and [[W]] both hate [[communism]] and [[Fidel Castro]] and should recognize these [[Patriotic Nigras|patriotic trolls]] instead of giving them the [[banhammer]]. The official reason from the FCC was that El Zol violated a rule requiring participants in on-air phone conversations to be informed that their call was being broadcast. Ferrero and Santos then decided to troll the FCC by paying their fine with pennies.

This is even more ridiculous when you consider that [[In_Soviet_Russia...|in Communist Cuba]], rules violate <u>you</u>.
