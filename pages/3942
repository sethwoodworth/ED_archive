Ian Schwartz
In July, Ian opened his site, which is perhaps the biggest piece of shit ever shat upon the tubes of the internet.  There are at least 50 posts a day, even when he claims to be on vacation (moar liek he waddled away from the basement to the fridge, amirite?).  His posts mainly consist of crybaby whining about [[Fag|John Edwards]] and [[cunt|Hillary Clinton]].  He also makes sure to provide the most unoriginal explanations for his posts, usually starting off with "Well Michelle Malkin/Ann Coulter/Sean Hannity/Phil Shoopman/Fox News sez..."
==Why Do Liberals Hate America?==
Run by a suppposed Jew, the entire site is devoted to exposing the [[liberal media]] by showing [[Holocaust|sane arguments]] from the right presented by [[Ann Coulter]] and [[Michelle Malkin]], and by illegally copying and sharing clips from [[Fox News]] without their permission.  He also does not allow any comments of any kind, unless its a request to worship his tiny cock.  For the last 500 posts, he has a total of about 20-30 comments.  Way to waste your allowance!

==[[Troll]]ing==
Since Ian is nothing but a money grubbing jew, he tries to keep his bandwidth down by refusing any and all comments that refuse to worship him as Jew-god.  However, you can always post comments on his "dugg" articles, or make sure you spam his pictures to every liberal blogger on the internet.  
==User:Umnumzana==
Back in the day, Ian used to run a site called Expose the Left, which was shut down for extreme copyright infringement.  That site allowed any and all comments, including some by this user.  [[Some argue]] that the user Umnumzana was either [[blackwingdragon]] or [[purelily]] in disguise.  He claims to be [[Jesus]] reincarnate and a compassionate [[conservative]].  Most likely he is an [[otherkin]], as he claimed to [http://www.exposetheleft.com/2006/07/16/liberal-says-not-enough-pro-palestine-news/#comment-167200 have written several books plus a 144,000+ page dissertation], but his degree can change from day to day, as this week it is currently [http://www.exposetheleft.com/2006/07/16/liberal-says-not-enough-pro-palestine-news/#comment-167442 a doctorate in philosophy].  Like blackwingdragon, he is known to spew out such gems like:

You are a coward a useless piece of liberal scum not worthy to live among human beings.'']
*[http://www.exposetheleft.com/2006/07/17/clinton-said-he-would-die-for-israel-will-he/#comment-168187 ''JWASL: I am waiting for your book on how you have sex with dogs, cats, sheep and horses, because no real woman would waste her spit on you. Then your book on how you decided to get a sex change so big sweaty men could treat you like the bitch you are!'']

His reaction after finding out about this page:

*''One of the joys about visiting this site is that I seem to seriously threaten the egos of so many insecure, immature and ignorant people. The number of bigoted, small minded extreme left wing morons on this one site is truly astonishing. Prove it? Just watch the childish reactions to this post and these simpletons will prove it for me! I am also glad we donâ€™t use our real names, or I would be spending a lot of time in court suing people for [[Slander, Slander Salamander|slander]].''

After the fall of Expose the Left for copyright fraud, Umnumzana migrated to [[Michelle Malkin|Hot Air]].  However, in a fit of lulz, Umnumzana was banhammered for his faggotry by none other than the [[Michelle Malkin|big clit]] [http://hotair.com/archives/2006/08/27/isikoff-armitage-outed-plame/]
