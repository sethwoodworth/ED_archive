'''STFW''' is an abbreviation for "'''Search the Fucking Web.'''"  Often used in a [[forum]] or on [[LJ]] when a [[newbie]] asks a stupid question, often about where to find something on the [[internets]] that they could easily find out themselves in 5 seconds with a [[Google]] search.

A sample exchange might go as follows:

:Prima: i just got this new internet thingie cuz i heard it had nekkid picz of paris hilton.
:Prima: ...where can i find those picz plz????
:Secunda: Just STFW.
:Prima: [[WHAT]]
