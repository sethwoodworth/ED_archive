<br/>Subject: Hey Megan,

I hope you are having a safe trip to Kentucky at this time.
 
As for me, it's not bad here.  I'm finishing up copying the G1 Transformers episodes to DVD-Rs.  I've learned I could download games/demos from the JAPANESE Playstation Store (I had to create a Japanese account, with a made-up street address).  It's cool, I've downloaded free demos of Folklore, Everyone's Golf 5 and the Playstation1 Demo of XI Sai (a dice game (it can be copied for play on PSP)).  And this game I'm learning about that is internet based (similar to the upcoming Home), from the Dokidemo title (the import Cat game on PSP).  I'm going to see if I can learn more on GameFaqs.com.
 
Also, I've learned from the US Playstation website about a NEW Gundam title coming soon for PS3 (hopefully rated better than Crossfire) titled "Dynasty Warriors: Gundam".  Apparently its gameplay will be based on the previous Dynasty Warriors games, but the Gundams will be the main playable mechs.  FYI, I've purchased the Crossfire game during Gamestop's Game Days sale for practically a steal at $29.99.
 
I have de-weeded Cwcville, and I'm working on getting it back in shape.  I look forward to our first Wi-Fi visit; please let me know the date and time YOU or I should have your/my gate open.  By the way, my DS's touch screen in the middle is out of order; I won't be able to touch the "g" key, so I will have to type the letters with my control pad and A button (it may be slower).
 
I will await your E-Mail, or I may check in again later.  You all take care.
 
Thinkin' of you fondly and sweetly;
Chris Chan.  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

<br/>Subject: Dearest Megan,

I lost a bit of sleep last night, because I remembered that yesterday (June 27), one year ago, Patti passed away.  I cried for a while, with my mom, being reminded of the Burdens hardest to bear; I'm fine now.  Funny side-stories, I didn't remember till just after I hit the sack, but earlier I was playing Guitar Hero to complete the Hard Mode.  One song to go, "Bark At The Moon"; I said to myself that this one was for Patti.  And before that, my mother suggested we go to the SPCA, in addition to finding about the upcoming Rummage Sale, we'd look at the puppies.  Subconsiously, we were, without realizing it, being reminded of this one-year anniversary.  At least now, Patti's resting in peace, and she's looking down and protecting us and our cats.  Did I tell you that Patti and our elder kitty were really close; they would chat on and on, share food and sleep together.
 
On the bright side, I took up Gamestop's current offer of trading in 2 PS3 games to get one FREE; I got the new Transformers Game after trading in Untold Legends Dark Kingdom and Armored Core 4.  I plan to getting replacement copies of those two in the near future.  AC4 is among the Game Days Sale offer at 25% off.
 
I hope you all are safe and doing well.  Take Care.
 
Thinkin' Fondly of you (alongside Patti; bless her soul);
Chris Chan.  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

I hope that you are able to get my messages over in Kentucky.  BTW, which time zone are you in, Central or Eastern?  That will matter to when you'd like me to visit you/open my gate.



As for the Dynasty Warriors - Gundam demo, I have enjoyed it.  It has better graphics than Crossfire, I get a bird's eye view of the scene, the sword and shield is used more than gunfire, and the control is easier and mech movement is faster.



Last Friday at the League was not bad.  A new kid entered who started his membership from a tournament, so he already had a POP ID number upon his first arrival to the Game Place.  I won a few games; lost a couple.  I didn't buy any Soul Calibur packs then, but I plan to this coming Friday.  On that issue, I will enclose scanned images of the cards I get in the e-mail I send you just after getting a pack or so.  Brianna and her family are doing good as well.



I miss you a lot, but I'm okay; I still get a sweet, happy feeling each time I think of your fun wit, your charms, your pretty face and the fun you and I have shared so far.  :)  I hope you and your family are safe and doing well.



I hope to hear from you soon, and I will send another message later on.  XOXOXO



Your Faithful Friend who thinks fondly of you;

Chris Chan.  &lt;3

I'm guessing you all have been busy, getting settled and enrolling John and whatnot, but I would appreciate a reply soon.
 
Anyhoo, I got the last 4 Soul Calibur (First Expansion) packs that were at the Game Place tonight, so I got to keep the box.  Quite a lot of cards to scan, so I'll just list them.  And you may look them up on eBay.  The picked up cards are as follows:
 
*Shishi-Oh - Asset
*Inhuman Fortitude - Asset
*Reverse Spiral - Atk
*Thrust Throw - Atk
Despair - Atk **Voldo**
Destined Greatness - Atk
The Power of the Gale - Found

That's it for this time.
 
Briana is still doing good, so is Tony and Ty.  We had three new members come in this time; I put together 3 decks for them.  Two them were brothers, Mason and Brandon, and Brandon, I've learned from their mother, is High-Functioning Autistic.  He also was born with weak legs, so he gets around on crutches.  Anyway, they all should know the Pokemon TCG rules well now.  
 
I will not be attending the League next Friday; my mother and I will be attending the SPCA Rummage Sale Opening that day, so no new cards then.
 
On Independence Day, my mother and I went to see the new Transformers movie; it was awesome.  It was very dramatic, had chunks of PG-13 humor and a dash of romance.  One humorous moment I remember was something I didn't get to see everyday, Bumblebee leaked lubricant onto a bad man of secret organization "Sector Seven" like he was doing number 1.    There was of course plenty of Military Land and Air action and drama.  One soldier was looking forward to coming home to hold his newborn daughter for the first time.  A few of the other soldiers were speaking spanish in front of the Americans.  And there were confrences at the Pentagon.  You don't have to be a total Autobot fan to enjoy the bunches of Men In Action that I know you would.  :)
 
Well, I have things to do, but I hope you all are doing well in Kentucky.  And I miss you, sweetie.  &lt;3  Please reply soon.
 
Faithfully yours with fondful thoughts;
Chris Chan.

<br/>Subject: Dearest Megan,

Just checkin' in again.  :)
 
I've completed my Transformers game with all missions and sub-missions completed and all icons and energon cubes collected.  I've unlocked all the bonus movie/toy/comic images, all seven movies and the ability to play as Generation 1 Optimus Prime and Megatron.  I've enjoyed the fantastic detailed graphics, a bit of "Deceptive" Destruction, flying around with Sixaxis Tilt control, Saving the day, crusin' the streets, and of course the transformations.
 
Currently, I'm playing Genji: Days of the Blade (free rental due Sunday); It's great ninja-style action, and the story is good too.
 
I hope you've been able to have fun with your PS2 and the Eyetoy or the Guitar.  :)  There is still nothing new in video games on Sailor Moon.  And upon investigation, I can download ALL the PGSM episodes from Veoh and get them burned to DVD (regardless of the subtitle situation; you can still watch it fully on PC or zoom out on your DVD Player), so I will start work on that soon.
 
And I have some dough set aside for the Rummage Sale this Friday; I could make out great with finding working systems and games for trade-in and profit.
 
Aside from all that, I think fondly of you lots, and I count down the days until you and your family return, as well as an E-Mail from you.  I miss you so much, and I hope you all are well and safe.
 
I got to go; the Simpsons are about to come on.  Hey...I like you.  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
 
Faithfully yours;
Chris Chan.

<br/>Subject: Dearest Megan,

I just rested after getting home from the rummage sale.  My mother and I left at about 1:00, we went to Chik-fil-a for Cow Appreciation Day (Free Combo for looking like a cow; I made cow masks for us).  After lunch, we went straight to the sale, where we were the 4th and 5th in line, and we waited about 2 1/2 hours.  I kept myself entertained with the original Transformers Movie on my PSP for the most part.  The NBC news crew was there, and it islikely that I got my face on television (I'll find out on "Film at 11").  And we were interviewed by a paper reporter.  As much to my excitement of hopeful finds of Gamecube, PS2 and such for profitable trade-in, after getting a shopping cart, I rushed (without running over anybody) to the electronics.  And to my dismay, all they had were a Sega Genesis, a Playstation 1, and the only PS2 they had was priced at $125 (whereas in previous years, it was priced at only $25), so I didn't buy anything.  Although my mother made out in her big bunch of fabrics and stuff.  On the way home, we picked up a couple more free combo meals, and I decided since I still had the dough, I went ahead and picked up at Wal-Mart a PS3 Intercooler set and a (Autobot) Bumblebee PS2 Slim Skin (for my PS3).  The day wasn't as swift as expected, but it wasn't a total loss.



I wish I could hear from you.  I hope you all are doing well.  I will send another e-mail soon.



Faithfully yours,

Chris Chan.  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

<br/>Subject: Dearest Megan,

From the "Rubi" (Spanish soap opera with english subtitles) DVD set I spent a few of my saved points on My Coke Rewards, which I've received Friday, I just watched the first episode; it was good, I've enjoyed the drama, as well as the scenery of Mexico.
 
I'd tell you more, but it's moderately hard to think with the return of the gunky ear; it just happened earlier today but in the left ear.  I've used some of my previously perscribed ear medicine, but I will attempt to wash it out in the shower later.  It's quite the bother like last time.
 
Aside from that, I'm still thinking of you sweetly and fondly; it is good.  :)  I long to see you again at the Game Place and welcome you back with open arms.  I sometimes feel lonely, but it is so worth the wait just to be close to you again.  &lt;3  I hope you are safe and well.  :)
 
I'll send you another message soon.
 
Faithfully yours;
Chris Chan.  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

<br/>Subject: Dearest Megan, (Parappa the Rapper)

About June 29th, I created, edited and submitted an video entry for Playstation.com's Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown.  I submitted it through e-mail, as well as uploading it to YouTube and Veoh.  I just got an E-Mail from the Playstation people, and Good News...
 
"Congratulations!  Your Parappa the Rapper video contest entry has made
it into the voting phase of the contest.  We will post your video on
us.playstation.com and invite the PlayStation Underground to vote on
their favorite.  Before the fun begins, please print and sign the
attached SCEA video release form and fax to my attention at
310.482.4201.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Good luck!
Nathan
PlayStation Community Support"
 
So I've printed the form, signed it, rushed to Kinkos and faxed it.  It would be so awesome if I won the Grand Prize... a trip for two to Seattle, WA for the Penny Arcade Expo.  And I couldn't think of anyone better to be there with me than you.  :)  But given your currently being in Kentucky, and if you all come back home that soon... it could be iffy.
 
I wanted to let you about that.  If you are able to, you may check out the video on Youtube or Veoh; I even mentioned you in it.  :)
 
Seriously, I really wish I could hear from you real soon.  I'd like to know how you all are doing, what's been good in Kentucky; all that good jazz.  I miss you.  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
 
I'll send another E-Mail soon.
 
Faithfully yours;
Chris Chan.

Happy Birthday to you!
Happy 21st Birthday, Sweetest Megan!
Happy Birtday to you!
&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 :)
 
I hope you are having a great Birthday over there in Kentucky.  This is what I am able to do for this time, but I did give you your presents earlier.  And since you have me in your locket, it's as if I was actually there for your 21st turn.  :)
 
And while I'm thinkin' about it, last friday was okay; nothing special.  I got one pack of SC Blades of Fury, and the cards included were as followed:
 
**Mitsurugi (Character Card)
Sole Survivor (Foundation~Yoshimitsu)
Spinning Sword (Attack~Yoshimitsu)
Mezentius Head Butt (Attack)
Killing Bite (Attack)
Raise the Shield (Foundation)
Tornado Swell (Attack)
Jolly Roger Hoist (Attack)
Phantasm Fleet (Attack)
Dread Charge (Foundation)
 
I am spreading the word throughout MySpace, my Sonichu, Pokesite 2 (english and spanish), Hot Wheels, and Bionicle websites, through the Playstation Network (with help from playing online with Motorstorm to get names), and Locally at the Game Place and such about voting for my PaRappa the Rapper Video.  I'd really like to win that trip and those PSPs, so I can share the expierence with you, my closest, sweetest friend.  &lt;3  Who knows, maybe I can wing it for good results.  :)
 
At least I can keep you up-to-date, even though it may still be a while before you can read these E-Mails.
 
I'll send you another one soon.  Have the Happiest of 21st Birthdays, because you've got a nice family to share it with and me.
 
Faithfully Yours;

<br/>Subject: Dearest Megan,

It was rainy about 3-5 this afternoon, but fortunately a bunch of players showed up today at the Game Place.  I didn't get a Soul Calibur Pack this week, but I noticed that they have in stock a two-deck pack for Street Figher UFS; Ryu Vs. "Ayku" (wasn't sure of that name) and new Yu-Gi-Oh (GX) Starter Decks featuring Jaden (the Holo card is Elemental Hero Necroshade) and... the boy who plays with the machanic toon vehicles (I forgot his name).  Tony warned me last week that he wouldn't make it today, so I worked pretty hard.



I had to sign up two new members; Bridget and Perry.  Bridget's deck was perfectly Psychic, so I didn't have to work on hers, but Perry's was a bit of chaos; one Squirtle, one Wartortle, one Blastoise EX, one Turtwig, one (stage 1 for turtwig), one matching stage 2, and the same column scheme applied to Plipup to Empoleon, Chimchar to Infernape and Charmander to Charizard.  And he had a bunch of non-evoling basics that made it a real messed-up haymaker, and the rest was about 2 Boost Energies, one Cyclone Energy, one Multi Energy, one Rainbow Energy, one Psychic, some of the other basics (excluding Metal and Dark) totaling to 28 Energy Cards.  And he had no Trainer cards.  And what he had in his book was somewhat out of order.  But I perservered with a mostly colorless deck for him.  :)  I got a few small headaches and head-quits (that's where my brain would just zone out for about a few seconds).



Aside from today, last week at the Playstation Store, after like a couple of months, they finally added a NEW PS1 title for download and play on PS3 and PSP: Castlevania - Symphony of the Night.  It set me back about 9.99, but I downloaded it.  I have made it about half-way to fully through; I'm now playing in the inverted castle (it's upside-down...freaky).



Also, I have been working hard on spreading the word around locally, on MySpace and on the PSNetwork about voting for my video on the Playstation website.  I've played Motorstorm online to get a bunch of names for new acquaintances; I've rarely been able to make it at First place.  But one time I did manage to make 3rd.  Quite the stress-work, but it will be worth it if I win the trip to Seattle.  I fantasy you and me taking the trip, having fun at the Penny Arcade Expo, maybe take a tour of the Nintendo of America company, playing Guitar Hero with you on my PS3 in our hotel room, and basically just being with you, period.  :)  And I would give you and John the two PSPs (but I would keep one of the two PaRappa the Rapper games).  But I digress...



I hope you and your family are doing well and good in Kentucky.  I'd wish for you to come back sooner, but I can't control how soon John will be able to finish his mechanic course.  I'll be happier when you are standing in front of me again, safe and sound.  :)



That's enough from my heart (blush) for a while, my sweet friend.  I'll e-mail you again soon.



Faithfully yours;

Chris Chan.  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

In addition to my message on your machine...
 
I REALLY WANTED THAT TRIP SO I COULD HAVE A CHANCE TO IMPRESS MY SWEETEST MEGAN AND POSSIBLY FULFILL MY DREAM OF GETTING MARRIED AND SOON HAVE A DAUGHTER NAMED CRYSTAL.  YET NOW I, A FRUSTRATED HIGH-FUNCTIONALLY AUTISTIC 25-YEAR OLD VIRGIN, HAVE BEEN BALLZ-BROKEN LIKE I HAVE THROUGH A BIG CHUNK OF MY LIFE IN AMERICA'S FAVORITE GAME, "KICK THE AUTISTIC!"  *sigh*
 
I had my fantasies of having fun with Megan, taking her to a really extravagent destination (I am not rich), taking a long-wanted tour of the Nintendo of America company tour, with her, playing Guitar Hero against the guy in the PaRappa costume, jamming with Megan in the hotel room and possibly our first time in the bed... *sigh*
 
Life can be soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo unfair and f***ing corrupt.
 
But I digress; TAKE THE A-CAPELLA RULE TO THE MAX on those THREE out of ten videos.
 
Take care;

<br/>Subject: Well, I'm emotionally busted... :(

I just learned that I am not the winner of the PaRappa Chop Chop Master Onion Contest; among their ten videos, they were organized Alphabetically (I checked the html source, and that explained why I was number 7.  Anyway, that lucky jerk, admstackhouse (assumed to be his e-mail name), gets to go to Seattle.  That SOB should have really been disqualified; his dance was supposed to be MUSIC-FREE, yet he has some s***y beatbox noises in the background throughout his video (so did two others).
 
I am Angry, Depressed and Lonesome ALL SIMULTANEOUSLY.  I worked so d*** hard; I sent like over 500 messages between MySpace, Playstation Network and AOL.  And I even made up over 120 dummy e-mail accounts to match with their dummy Playstation accounts, so I could stuff the f***in' ballot...
 
I really wanted to take you somewhere fun and exciting so you and I could be together for longer than usual...and I really wanted to give you and John each a PSP...  *sigh*  I've failed.  So much effort...rappin' and dancin' with goofy effects to be even considered...spreading the word as far and wide as possible...wasted.  And I did it all for you, Megan; I had you in my heart as I chopped the Onion A-La Mode dance...I gave so much energy, even had a gut virus for a couple of days...crazy I guess.
 
Anyway, I'm not in such a delighful mood at this time; it may take a few days or so for me to recover...then again, you make me feel happy...I just realized that you were and still are a continuing inspiration for me.  I looked at you in our photo ever since you left for Kentucky, and I get a happy feeling... from the feeling of having you to fall on when I feel low.  You are such a delightful listener, and you are truly intelligent when you talk about what interests you and such.  I am so delighted to have you in my life, and I appreciate you everyday.  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
 
Oh, so what if I didn't win that trip; I still can look forward to being able to coming over to your house, or you to mine, sometime.  And I will get to see you at least on Fridays (although I'd like to be able to be with you much more than that).  I like you so much, Megan.
 
As for the what happened at the Game Place; it was so-so, and I didn't get any Soul Calibur cards today.  Although from my monthly tugboat, I did get the new Guitar Hero game and the PS1 classic, UmJammer Lammy, some ink for my printer, a bunch of slim cd and DVD cases and a 4GB memory stick duo.
 
Although I'm certain you have oodles of stories of your days in Kentucky, and I truly look forward to listening to you telling me about them.  :)
 
Thank you, Megan, for being my continuing inspiration.  I hope you all are doing well, and I await your safe and sound return.  Take care.
 
Faithfully yours;
Chris Chan.

Nathen, I have sent the following message to the community support at the Playstation Website, and the webmaster.  I have also called Playstation support to directly input my complaint.  So, I thought I would send it to you as well.
 
I DO NOT BELIEVE Adamstackhouse should be the winner of the PaRappa the Rapper Chop Chop Master Onion Contest, and there are a few others among the TOP TEN who all have VIOLATED THE POSTED OFFICIAL RULES.  Please allow me to describe the violations as I rewatch the saved videos from my PSP, and I quote the Official Rules at http://www.us.playstation.com/EP/Promotions/283/Rules.html.
 
"The performance must be a cappella (meaning without music), and it must be one of the three (3) songs that are provided on the contest entry page. The lyrics must be the same lyrics used in the game. Changing the lyrics will result in disqualification. Please do not include other people in your video as this will also result in disqualification."
 
And if you Don't believe me, you should watch the TEN videos again for yourselves.  *The bolded and underlined names are the names of the individuals who have violated the Officials Rules, and the BOLDED details are the obvious violations.
 
Video 1: adamstackhouse- IT HAS MUSIC - He has his SISTER IN THE VIDEO WITH HIM.<br/>
Video 2: ajbrewer- Nothing wrong here; no music, no lyric change, and he's all alone.  :)<br/>
Video 3: aprelewsky- IT HAS MUSIC - He has a DUDE IN THE VIDEO WITH HIM.<br/>
Video 4: Billjones- This one is cool; no music, no lyric change, and although it looks like there are two guys in the video, upon closer inspection, they are both the same dude.  :)<br/>
Video 5: brudell- He has his DUDEFRIEND IN THE VIDEO WITH HIM.<br/>
Video 6: chrisadams- Although it is high on volume and echoful, he is all alone in the video, no music, and he is quoting the lyrics from his printed sheet.  :)<br/>
Video 7: CWCSonichu *My Video*- Granted, I did start and end the video with an introduction and Guitar Hero ending, and that was only a photo of me and my friend, Megan; the rules do not state anything about photos.  I had the printed lyrics taped to the tripod holding the camera, and I did not change any of the lyrics of Chop Chop Master Onion; that was why I was leaning forward at times in the video.  And, obviously, I had no music during the song.  :)<br/>
Video 8: DSiferd- This is okay; no music, good lyric match, and like in Billjone's video; the leaf guy and driver are both the same guy.  :)<br/>
Video 9: scotteichmer- Although it was too close to his face, there was no music, he matched the lyrics (with a "That's it" at the end), and a stuffed monkey does not qualify as a person.  :)<br/>
Video 10: suryabuchwald- IT HAS MUSIC, and it sounds more like the theme to Super Mario Bros than Chop Chop Master Onion.  And I will note that upon close inspection, the three guys are the same dude.<br/>
 
I understand that it's too late to hold another election, but I suggest that you award the Grand Prize to the highest voted among the SIX Qualified Videos.
 
Thank you for your time, and please personally reply to this E-Mail As Soon As Possible, or call me at my home phone at (434)-990-0198.
 
Sincerely,
Mr. Christian Weston Chandler - Ruckersville, Virginia.

<br/>Subject: Dearest Megan,

Yesterday, after some rest, I still felt anger and resentment against that lucky S.O.B. winner.  But I have found two faults in his video that were against the official rules; there was music, and there was more than one person in the video.  I also found three more out of the remaining nine with the similar violations.  I have sent some e-mails among the Playstation consumer services, and I have called the company personally and registered my grand complaint.  It's not a matter of jealousy or loss; it's the principal of rule violations.  Justice will be done to the seven people involved in the four violating videos, or I am not Autistic.
 
Anyway, I wanted to let you know about that.  I hope you all are still doing well in Kentucky, and I will truly feel so much better when I see you personally in front of me safe and sound.  :)
 
Faithfully yours;
Chris Chan.  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

Christian-
 
I haven't been checking my email until recently, and I just want to say 
that your behavior has irritated me for the last time. First I'll start off with 
saying that I'm glad you didn't win the contest because I have no interest in 
going on a trip alone with someone who can't keep his hands off me. I'm not your 
girlfriend and I never will be. When I say "don't touch me" that means DON'T 
TOUCH ME! What may seem friendly to you is sexual harrassment to me. You whine 
that you're just being friendly but you obviously have no consideration for my 
feelings. 
The way you went off on Nina because she patted me on the head was very 
rude and uncalled for. Just because someone else has made physical contact with 
me doesn't give you the authority to do so. Remember, I have the right to decide 
who can come near me.
 
Also I can't say I like how you used my photo in your video and on the 
cover of your comic book. I want them removed from the internet immediately. 
Since I'm not a myspace member I can't view what you post. If there are any 
photos of me on your blog I want them removed.
 
And I don't like your "Megan Obsession" I don't like being a character in 
your comics. I don't like how you made me a character in Soulcalibur and Animal 
Crossing. That kind of behavior really freaks me out.
 
With all that said, we're down to two options:
A: We remain friends and ONLY friends period. As in no more touching me, 
following me, asking me personal questions, and giving me things. We can still 
battle and trade cards and talk. 
-or-
B: Never see me again
 
I'm sorry it's come down to this but I've told you repeatedly in a 
nice way to stop, but you've never listened. 
 
I hope you will finally take what I just said into serious consideration, 
and know now that if try your advances again I won't be very nice about 
it.
 
Please listen to me next time
~Megan

<br/>Subject: OUCH....My Heart...

Megan, sweetie, I NEVER said anything about you being my "girlfriend"; in the video, I said, "The only song I know is 'Master Onion' which I got from a demo I borrowed from my friend, Megan.  I truly care about your feelings, and I am 500 times sorry...  :_(  I meant what all I did when I talk about you to be complimentive and flattering, not the contrary.  I was only trying to make you happy.
 
I NEVER meant any "sexual harrassment"; granted that I have had one or two fantasies before, but I sincerely would NEVER intentionally do anything of the sort to you without your consent.  You mean SOOOOOO much to me...  As youu are aware, I'm guessing, I do not have many gal-pals in or around Charlottesville, and I treasure having you in my life, and as my closest, sweetest friend I could ever have in this one-hores, VIRGIN-ONLY STATE.  If I lost you... it would TOTALLY SHATTER my heart, my soul, my being.  I CAN NOT AFFOARD to lose you; I need you.  Having you in my life, and as my gal-pal, is essentally wkat keeps me from reverting to a sad, lonely, depressed, apocolyptic state, like I have expierenced before when that witch of PVCC, Mary Lee Walsh, SHATTERED MY HEART AND SOUL when I was searching for a BOYFRIEND-FREE, caring, smoke-free, non-alcoholic, white girl to be my friend, and over time maybe grow into a SWEETHEART.  Even right now, as I type this E-mail, I feel like I have been torn vertically into two, and I am typing on a keyboard that has been turned upwardly crooked from being banged against a raised knee...  It really hurts...
 
I will remove the video from the internet soon as per your request, and I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY want you and me to still be friends.  And as much as I truly understand how you feel about romance and love,  I can't deny the feelings in my heart...  I MISSED YOU SOOOOO MUCH; I would look at our sacred photo every night, and I would feee soooo much happier, because I have you as my one-and-only, single-solitary, once-in-a-lifetime-like, gal-pal.  And I would wonder how you were getting along and faring in Kentucky, and I would hope to get to see you again in front of me soon...  Megan... I love ou.
 
I gotta go.
 
Faithfully yours;
Christian W. Chandler.

<br/>Subject: Hey, Anna

I have been recovering from the worst weekend of my life.  In a nutshell, explicit fan art freaked me out, then someone else put a copyright symbol on their fan art (giving the impression of Sonichu being theirs), I responded to both offenses appropriately, then I Googled "Sonichu", and I found a page that deficated on my person and character.  And the second photo-jpg on there was actually taken at The Game Place last Friday, with me thinkin' the dude was taking a pic of the child I was playing Pokemon TCG with.  I had asked the guys at The Game Place to check their servaliance camera footage of the timeframe, so I could possibly learn the identity of the person who took that photo.  But the guys could not get it to work; they have to talk to their boss-type person.  One of them put things in perspective for me, I calmed down for a while.  Then my mother comes in during my peace with a lecture of doing more things around the house; I waited for her to finish, then I bursted out the events in a mouth-running-faster-than-my-brain fashion.  Now, she is possibly on a warpath against this dude.  A hacking terrorist group, Anonymous, and 4Chan are somehow involved in that page as well.

I'm sorry; I'm still recovering from the worst weekend of my life.  I'll get back to you with more positive information soon.

I don't know if I told you about it, but a few months ago, I found this page that is degrading to my persona, http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/chris-chan/ ,

and they've quoted what was supposedly your story, "The Crazy Pacer".  I did not read much of the story, and I did not see the need to bother you about it.  But recently, I got a message from someone who found the story through a link on the encyclopediadramatica page, and this person based my personality on it.



After you check out the ED page, I would like to ask you, as a friend, was that really your story, an if it was, please, to save a piece of what could be my reputation, delete it, and keep it for yourself only on your hard drive.



Thank you.  Take care.

Chris Chan.

<br/>Subject: Hey, Megan.

I hope you're doing well.  Anyway, I'll get to the point; there is a way you can work with me on the elimination of the "Chris-chan" page on Encyclopedia Dramatica, basically the pages on whole ED website are wiki (similar to html editing), and setting up an account to edit the page is free; you may want to use a fake e-mail address.  Anyway, you can remove the all the junk they put about you on there, as well as the drawing from the page for starters, but be careful not to take out TOO MUCH; they may undo your doing, so you may want to make multiple edits; remove the story on the first time, then add some random thing that comes to your mind onto the bottom of the page.  I've managed to have the drawing removed and replaced with a different, yet similar image for a while, but they undid that bit of my handiwork.
 
I can only do so much at one time, since after I make an edit (behind their backs), they "ban" my IP address from undoing their undoing, and I have to wait a few hours to a day or two before I can anything more against them.
 
That's the story there.
 
Also, under a spot of rage against them for the answer some of them gave me when I asked them why they hated me, I've alerted the media about it through e-mail.  I've said nothing about you to them, but you may want to try to remove the stuff about you from the page ASAP.
 
Again, I am really sorry about this whole mess.
 
I pray for your emotional recovery.
Keeping you fondfully in my thoughts;
Chris Chan.

<br/>Subject: Megan...

Firstly, I suggest that you take another look at the page; in the FIRST Paragraph, they theorize and mock me with, and I copy and past to quote, "and drawing pictures of himself having sex with his imaginary twin sister."  And the images were ALIGNED to the RIGHT, so the theory is matched UP to DOWN with respective image comments from, "... Imaginary sister?" to "I don't like where this is going" and finally, "Chris' own artwork portraying his sick fantasies."  And to break my camel's back, they state in the second paragraph under "The Comic Itself", I quote, "A later upload by CWC himself verified that he wants to have sex with his imaginary twin sister. So, this Crystal would be both his daughter and sister... In other words, he wants to impregnate his mother, then have sex with the offspring."  
 
Secondly, I have TRIED to delete the nude drawing, even to replace it, but in the discussion page of my account I created to edit the page away from mockery, but every time I delete or replace the image, they would re-upload the original pic.  They call what I'm doing AGAINST the "article" vandalism, and they tell me, "vandalism is completely pointless (click here to find out why), and will get you a swift ban, so you might as well stop."  And even though after they "ban" me, I wait a few hours to a couple of days and I am unbanned.  You can consider me "The Resistance" against the "Alien Dominators" of E.D., because that's the role I am occupying in this tragedy.
 
Also, I've told them they're not only hurting me emotionally, but they were hurting you, Megan, emotionally and deeply as well, because they were dragging your name through the mud with mine.
 
As for the drawing itself, I've realized that it was done not only out of inspired fantasy, angst against E.D., and love for you, but also a major release for my crazy, mixed-up hormones.  If I didn't have the foresight to put my pent-up frustrations and feelings in the form of something, I might have become an abusive maniac, so thank god for allowing me to release my bottled up frustrations in a more positive, yet not so "Politically Correct", and not physically hurting others, method.
 
Be the release as it may, I am hurting SOOOOO MUCH MORE than you can be, because I have been taking the abuse from those jerks on E.D.  If you want to get it all off the "article", be my guest; make your account, send your message of the "Resistance" and delete the Major Chunk off the page in edit; they will only undo your missile barrage of damage in one felt swoop.
 
I am depressed and emotionally exausted from ALL THIS STRESS.  The only thing I can do that won't get undone is be as apologetic as I can ever be from the bottom of my sad, depressed heart.
 
I'm Sorry, Megan, for the massive warfare I have wrought against you and me in a damn fucktarded release of my damn hormones.
 
I'm sorry.
Christian Weston Chandler.

Sir, or madam, my name is Christian Weston Chandler (aka Chris Chan).  There is a page on Encyclopedia Dramatica which has been dragging my name, as well as a very close gal-pal of mine, through the mud.  I have been trying to get the people responsible to take the whole page down and leave it blank, but obviously failed.  Today, I've tried to take the matter into my own hands by searching for the code for the "Edit Lock", so I can delete everything on the page and Lock it from anyone ever replacing the degrading information onto it again.  I've found your Mediawiki Software, but I am askew with confusion on how to even install the program and all that (the unrecognizable .tar extension didn't help much either).  Please help me in deleting everything on the page, and putting a Edit Lock onto it.
 
Thank you, and have a good day.

<br/>Subject: Please Read This

Dear Mr.Chandler,

Before I get to what I want to say in this e-mail, let it be known that this is NOT a hate e-mail, nor is it intended for the sole purpose of being mean to you. However, I will say that I am going to be blunt and tell you straightfoward what I want to say, which may in turn hurt you. It is up to you whether or not you would want to read this.

With that said, I want this e-mail to help you with some advice on your current "quest", as you put it, for love.

First off, it is not your fault you were born with Autism. I feel sympathy because it makes it all that more difficult to land you a girl. However, you must realize that not everyone will feel oh-so sympathetic or understand your troubles. The most saddening part of life is that not everyone will like you or the things you do, but you must move away from them and realize there are plenty of like-minded people like you.

Now, even though you have Autism, this doesn't mean that you are destined to live a horrible lonely life, but you should know that you can't use "autism" as an excuse for everything. Blaming a disorder for all the troubles in you life will not get you far. If you want others to look past your autism, you must do so as well. You must see yourself as you, regardless of what disorder you have.

I have plenty of friends with Asperger's and high-functioning autism. One of my close friends Alex has to deal with autism standing in his way of fitting in at school, yet he has a great talent of singing. He took that good thing about him and won the talent show, and gained friends. You should take the very best talent you have and expand it to the best of your ability.

Now on to your girlfriend troubles..

I think at this moment in your life, you goal shouldn't be just scoring with a chick, but making friends. If I'm correct, you have a MySpace. Try finding people in your area that share you like for video games. Be it a guy, don't ignore him. After all, he does have his friends, some of who may be single girls.

You also need to not set your expectations so high. I'm not saying you should go off and date the nearest obese black lady. However, what you need most is dating experience. After having been through various relationships, you can get past that akward "approaching" phase with confidence. Think of meeting a girl as a friend, not as a future life partner.

Also, I do not mean to offend, but the whole sign thing has to go. If it hasn't worked for the past 8 or so years, it probably won't work now. To us females, it shows you as someone who lacks the confidence to go up to someone. Women want someone who can have the courage to break the ice and start a conversation. Maybe if you see a nice girl with a dog in the park, start with something simple like complimenting how cute/burly/adorable her dog is. Then you can go on and start a conversation about your dog and what it looked like, etc... 
Any compliment about her can most likely be used as a convo starter, aside from pick-up lines and the plain creepy.

Another thing you may want to work on is...your wardrobe. I have to say that you I feel as if it's trapped in the 80's. Also, your Sonichu medallion..oh man, this really hurts to break it to you, but...it'd be best left at home. Sorry man, but it's like one giant pussy deflector. That's all I can say about it, and I'm trying my best not to be harsh about it here.

You may want to revise your MySpace profiles and such a bit. When you talk about marrige and the like in your profile, it'd tend to ward off women, for they'll feel that if they even talk to you that they'd be all of a sudden committed. Talking about marrige should wait when you and her feel it's right.

I hope this will help you in your "girlfriend" quest. I know that Encyclopedia Dramatica will keep their article up about you, but if you move on and not bother talking about it or vandilize it, it'll soon be forgotten. Anonymous feeds off of you being upset over the article. Once you move on and forget about it, the sooner you can live a better life.

Please Reply Soon,
Some Random Gaiafag

I wish to re-report the heinous webpage of worst levels of mockery against me,
 
This webpage (http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Chris-chan) has been haunting me since it originated around Halloween, 2007; I have previously reported it, but no response.  I have recently received an e-mail from the Original Person who is responsible for putting it up in the first place.  I have TWO sources that marks him red-handed; under "edit", if you check the VERY FIRST name that contributed to the page, it is "HowellGames".  And the e-mail from him at howellgames@gmail.com, his name is Jason Kendrick Howell, as he states in his e-mail.  Further, to quote the e-mail, 
 
"Hello Chris, this is howellgames. The creator of the ED page for you.
 
My, my, you seemed rather angry about it in your last youtube video! A few months ago, you asked me why I made the page for you. My reason? You were too damn funny to ignore. I have nothing against you personally, but you really need to let go of some of that anger you have. Also, the page will not be brought down.
 
Toodles!
 
Sincerely,
Howellgames, AKA Liquid Snake, AKA Jason Kendrick Howell"
 
I want that webpage taken down FOREVER, because it drags my good name through the mud with such high levels of hatred, and sexually explicit trash, and constant harassment as further entries were inputed from him and many others who hate me "For the LULZ" (Laughs at my expense).  Also, massive misuse of my original hand-drawn Sonichu content, and then some.  Please E-Mail me when you all are on the verge of taking Jason Kendrick Howell, and the Encyclopedia Dramatica webpage, down for good and forever.
 
And with your televised support, and FBI-type of people among your known people, I will feel better and safer in knowing that webpage is on its way OFF THE WEB.
 
Sincerely;

of possible liars and trojan horses from those who mock me in such 
slanderous ways.  (http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Chris-chan has 
been pestering me for almost a year, but thank our Lord and God that 
that website is finally on the verge of being removed for good). 

 


Anyway, to confirm the identity of "women" who have contacted me in 
e-mails, I've been pondering what would be the most comfortable way for me to confirm the identity and intentions for myself.  Then it hit me earlier today, I could refer her to my most trustworthy friend, and she can talk to her for me and let me know.  And, well, I couldn't think of anyone better than you, my neighborhood friendly Reverend.  :)  I felt it wise to check in with you to see how you feel about me referring you, and if any of the internet women who contacted me should come in that you can converse with her a bit and letting me know from your impression.  Please let me know how you feel about that.



Peace,

Christian Chandler.

Dear Christian,

I know this hurt you, and I understand that repentence was part of the process of responding to this occurance.  Repentence means "turning away," which means that it is important not only to feel badly about what one has done, but also to take steps to turn away from the behavior--remember what Marty Peterman said about not sending anything over the internet you wouldn't want your grandmother to see.  The internet offers anyone the opportunity to create any identity they wish; it's easy to deceive people if that's what they want to do.  This means you have to be smarter than they are and not play their games.

I was hoping that meeting with Marty would help you to do that, so I've been surprised by this recent turn of events.  Did you know that we have a new staff member at church?  I am wondering if you might find talking with her to be helpful; I know talking with men is difficult for you, and she is a woman.  Her name is Rocky Shoemaker and she is a pastoral counselor, which means that she is a pastor but also someone trained to listen and help people with personal struggles and difficulties.

I would be glad to meet with you and with Rocky together, to see if talking with her would be a good place to talk about your feelings related to what has happened with Kawaii Kitsune and your quest for a sweetheart.  I trust Rocky and think she is very good at what she does.  We are both available on Thursday afternoon--please give me a time that would be convenient for you.

I know God has heard your pain, and the church wants to be helpful to you.  I hope you will be in touch.

Blessings,
Elizabeth

Hello and thank you for contacting Nintendo,


We are flattered that you have so much interest in evaluating Nintendo games.  At this time, however, we do not have any plans to create a program that would allow the general public to evaluate games in their homes.  The consumer electronics industry is highly competitive.  For security reasons alone, we do not generally send games to individuals before we ship them to retail stores.  

Also, most of our game testing is done by our own in-house Research and Development Teams.  Having game evaluations done at a central location allows us to evaluate all games in the same way.  Much of the evaluation process involves watching an evaluator's reaction as they play.  Sometimes the information we obtain from watching a game evaluator is just as important, or more important, than the information they provide after they've played the game.

However, it may interest you to know that as a benefit of our My Nintendo Program, we recently sent out beta test discs to our NSider Community of Sages, making them the first public group to get hands on experience with one of our upcoming titles so that they could provide us with valuable feedback.  We may offer similar opportunities in the future, so make sure to sign-up for our My Nintendo program, and participate regularly in Nintendo's official online forums and in Nintendo Power Chat sessions to become a Sage.  

For additional information about becoming a Sage, head to www.nintendo.com/productregdes.  In this section of our site, you'll find information on the three different membership levels that we have available: Member, Nsider, and Sage.  For Sage, there will be a link for additional information on how to reach this top honor.

If you haven't already done so, you can sign-up for a My Nintendo membership and become part of Nintendo's extensive online world.  If you choose to become a member of this exclusive community, you can maintain your Nintendo Power subscription (update addresses, review your account history, request a replacement issue), view the status of any order or repair, register qualifying products, and gain access to member only content such as our forums.  And the best part is it's completely free!  

Even if you are not a Sage, you still have the ability to let us know what you like.  Each month Nintendo Power magazine has a Player's Poll Contest.  This contest asks you to send in an information card concerning Nintendo games and products.  We use this information to evaluate the success of current products and to develop plans for future products.  For information on subscribing to Nintendo Power, please visit our Online Store (http://store.nintendo.com) and click on "Magazines & Player's Guides."   

Sincerely,

Nintendo of America Inc.

I am a avid game player.  I have a wide collection of video games ranging from NES to Nintendo Gamecube, with matching systems, and a detailed list of the titles that I own and previously played.  This E-Mail is to inquire about your game-tester job.  Is there a possibility that I could become a tester for you all from my home?
I look forward to hearing from you, thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
Christian Chandler.

I've just talked to my father about him coming one Friday.  Currently, he's a bit under the weather.  But if he feels better by this coming Friday, he'd like for us to get together at the McDonalds  closest to the Game & Hobby place after the League-Play.  I'll let you know for sure Friday.
 
Thank you for the drawings you gave me.  For your island's name, I feel that, "Parodyse Island," is a slightly better name.
 
Everytime I see your drawings, I get inspired to want to work more on my comics.  So, I'll be working more often on them; I hope you're still working on your Strawberry Pink story, because it fascinates me.  ;8)
 
I'll talk to you again soon.
 
Stay Sweet;
 
Chris Chan.

<br/>Subject: Hey, Meg-Chan.

Hey, no worries about the park meeting yesterday; I enjoyed watching the ducks and the fish.  I've also talked to some of the ducks... have I done my "Donald Duck" imitation for you?  And the children that passed by were fun to watch as well.  I'd love to ride the train with you.  :)
 
I plan on working on my room as well this week.
 
I'll jump in on the 87-photo lot tonight at about 7:45...wait till the last minute... and punch in my max. bid.  I'll let you know about the monetary total after winning the photos for you.  ;)
 
That's funny you've bought Super Princess Peach; so did I, and I am enjoying it as well.  I'll send you a list of the games of your selected systems in my next E-Mail in a MSExcel file.  I'll bold the ones I'd be willing to trade/give to you; you can print it for yourself and highlight the one's you'd like (I've misplaced the list with your underlines... I'm sorry).
 
Megan, I'd feel much better if I could converse with you about these situations vocally (than written), because I feel a bit of tension from waiting a day or two for your reply.  And I feel that our points would come across between us more effectively.  I understand that you don't like to "waste time on the phone," but how often do you receive calls at your house or cell from anyone other than telemarketers?  So, could I get your phone number, please?
 
I know that I've given you mine a few times, so you have that.
 
Love, with you always in my mind and heart;
 
Chris Chan.

<br/>Subject: Cease and desist

Mr. Chandler,

Through anonymous sources, it has been made aware to me that you have established a fandom of sorts revolving around my character 'Sonichu'. As the proud writer/artist of the cult 'Sonichu' comic series - having recently enjoyed its fifth year since professional publication through the UK branch of Archie Comics after rough origins of self-publication starting in 1998, I am excitedly exploring the possibility of bringing the series to North American audiences -  I am always one to help and provide information towards other aspiring artists. However, having seen the  extent to which you have blatantly plagiarized my work, I feel it is necessary for me to step in. I ask you to view the sample image I have submitted, the cover for Sonichu #4 - clearly used as the exact template for the cover page of so-called CWC Comic's fourth issue of 'Sonichu'. Having spent much time and effort with the creation of characters such as Mary Lee Scott and Christopher Chandley, you can imagine my surprize upon discovering that not only had they been copied in their entirety, but the situations and conflicts they encounter had been directly stolen as well. Christopher's struggles to acquire a soul mate is the glue that has held my series together, and it is a serious blow to me to discover that someone has had the disrespect to use it for their own personal gain without any form of acknowledgment or citation. Perhaps even worse is the, frankly, childlike way you have gone about copying my work page-for-page. The sheer lack of artistic effort on your part is a true slap in the face, one that leaves me convinced that your plagiarism was done with the expressed intent to spite my efforts to make an honest living and support my girlfriend.

It is for these reasons, and the obvious financial liabilities on the part of Archie Comics UK, that I send you a cease and desist notice on ANY AND ALL physical or intellectual property relating to the Sonichu franchise, including the maintenance of your website under its current incarnation as 'CWC's Sonichu Site'. You are expected to remove all offending materials from all online sources with which you are in charge of within one week of November 6, 2007. Failure to comply with these demands will result in talks with the webmasters of Tripod and of Myspace to have aforementioned materials removed forcefully. Thank you for your compliance.

-Matthew David Kelly

What to Do.

Change the password. Give it to no one else. Don't post around or in anyway that would suggest you are not him. If you do you contaminate the possibility for further action.

He logs in to youtube probably daily. For a while he may think he's entering his password wrong. After the trolling he has become cautious so the possibility will come to his mind sooner rather than later. Try to be quick in figuring out what you want to do with the opportunity. I suppose you'll want to make it count.

Good luck.
