Fendippitous Eggmen
{{needsmoar|images}}

The '''Fendippitous Eggmen''' are a [[forced meme]] created sometime in early to mid-April 2010 by [[newfag]]s on [[B|/b/]] in an attempt to confuse other newfags with their cryptic posts so that the aforementioned newfags would feel superior. However, this [[dental plan|plan]] of theirs was foiled as multiple other newfags refused to accept that they were just… multiple other newfags, and began [[spam]]ming the posts all over the [[internets]].

== Lolwut? ==

Hundreds and hundreds of cryptic one-line posts have appeared in random threads on [[B|/b/]], asking if people have heard of these so-called "Fendippitous Eggmen," or stating that the "Fendippitous Eggmen" would be "coming for you soon." At the time that they first appeared, the only [[The Google|Google]] results for "Fendippitous Eggmen" were these posts themselves, repeating the same [[shit nobody cares about|shit]] over and over again. 

Around the same time as this [[fag]]gotry was proceeding, similar one-liners asking about [[fag|someone]] named "Grumfeld van der [[Masturbation|Spooijwanker]]" had started to appear. Google revealed that this was a reference to an [[fag|individual]] mentioned in [http://www.pnarp.com/ a blog] by [http://www.facebook.com/pnarp Phillip Norbert Årp], and as early as March [[newfag|someone]] had been [[copypasta|spamming copies]] of Pnårp's bizarre and most likely [[drug|drug-induced]] [[shit nobody cares about|blog entries]] all over random threads on /b/.

A couple weeks after the Fendippitous Eggmen blizzard had started, [http://www.pnarp.com/2010/04/25/ another entry] appeared on [[shit nobody cares about|Pnårp's blog]] on April 25 about the Fendippitous Eggmen. Shortly after this, [[moar|more]] one-liners started appearing all over the place asking if Grumfeld van der Spooijwanker was one of these Fendippitous Eggmen. Soon the [[The_Cancer_That_Is_Killing_/b/|cancer]] started metastasizing as other [[fag|/b/tards]] started composing their own variants of the "Fendippitous Eggmen" posts and [[cum|blew their loads]] all over the [[internets]].

On May 2, [http://www.pnarp.com/2010/05/02/ yet another entry] was posted to Pnårp's blog describing his full run-in with the Fendippitous Eggmen and how he dealt with them.

A couple of seemingly unrelated [[YouTube]] videos have been titled "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvWt0nF1EmQ Fendippitous Eggmen]" and "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0baczvRAuYA Fendippitous Eggmen Finale]."

[[Wikipedia|TOW]] describes the Fendippitous Eggmen as patent nonsense, meaningless, and incomprehensible.

Wherever these Fendippitous Eggmen are encountered, they must be given the walrus or they will continue [[spam]]ming their [[faggotry]] forever.

== What the hell does "fendippitous" mean? ==

[[Shit nobody cares about|No one knows]]. It sounds similar to "serendipitous" but the tone of the Fendippitous Eggmen posts seems to imply it's something like "dreaded" or "horrible." [[Shit nobody cares about|It probably doesn't matter]].
