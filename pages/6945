Resident Evil 4

{{needsless|lists}}

Called [[2005|2005's]] [[video game]] of the year or some shit, ''Resident Evil 4'' is seen as the best game in the RE series. Though this is probably because its plot has barely anything to do with the plot of the other ''[[Resident Evil]]'' games, which by now is as stale as [[Hilary Clinton| Hilary Clinton's]] vagina.

Since this game takes place in [[Spain]], many of the characters' names are just basic words in Spanish.  For example, the wolf enemies are called Colmillos, which is Spanish for "fangs," and Garrador is Spanish for "man with claws." [[Some argue]] that they were chosen by the producers of ''Dora the Explorer''.

For whatever reason, it is considered the Gamecube's best game.  Really, though, that's probably because Nintendo fanboys were using it as the token M-rated game in the console wars.  Ah, console fanboyism.  How it keeps us from missing middle school, and how little it matters when they port it to [[PS3|every]] [[360|other]] [[PC|system]] [[Wii|anyway]].

==Story==
Leon S. Kennedy is sent to Spain (Moar liek [[Maine]] [[Amirite]]?) to look for the [[George Bush|President's]] daughter who has been kidnapped.  After finding the fat-assed slut, Leon travels through villages, castles, [[shit|sewers]], mines, a huge military base on a deserted island, and several locations filled with lava; all of the attractions for which Spain is [[typical|typically]] known. There was initially some concern about potential racial backlash from the Spanish community for depicting them as [[Republicans|crazed, religious rednecks]], but Capcom learned in 2008 that only happens when the villains are black.

==Main Characters==
*'''Leon S. Kennedy''': A pretty-boy who is obviously the <s>[[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[American]] [[an hero|hero]]</s>--scratch that; he saves a foreign community from the scum that ''they'' put in charge this time--, [[JFK|Kennedy]] name and all.  Leon is most likely [[gay]], as indicated by the inclusion of his middle initial, his [[emo]] hairstyle, the attach&#0233; case which he carries around with him, and the fact that he would rather hit on his [[dyke|mannish]] radio contact instead of the blonde [[slut]] who outright offers to [[fuck]].  [[Fangirls]] deny this and insist that he would still sleep with them, even though he is <b>not a real person</b>. Uses such witty comebacks as "Saddler, YOU'RE small-time!", "Rain or shine... you're goin' down!", "No thanks... BRO!", and "I'll [[Suck|break]] your [[dick|bones]]!" He also likes to cut himself while listening to deathcore.

*'''[[loli|Ashley Graham]]''':  The [[President|President's]] daughter.  A typical [[retard|damsel in distress]].  She is decent [[fap]]ing material with mute on, especially in her bonus outfit. She also has unusually big [[breasts]] and [[ass]], which Leon points out for some reason, even though he's [[gay|not interested in girls]]. If you lead her to an edge, tell her not to follow you, jump down, and aim all the way up, you can see her panties.  She'll then yell at you and call you a [[pervert]].  [[Srsly]].  Bonus points for using a scoped rifle. Other than that, she's [[typical|useless as fuck]] and deserves to get raped by Saddler, but Leon has to save her anyways because he's a tool.

*'''Luis Sera''': Undercover hispanic that [[Homosexuality|makes friends]] with Leon. Gets totally [[pwn|pwned]] by Saddler's [[penis]]. Probably the only good character in the game that isn't the Merchant, but completely unplayable to make room for some guy in a gas mask that plays no role in the storyline whatsoever.

*'''Osmund Saddler''': [[Democrat|Anti-American]] leader of the village [[cult]].  Has a [[tentacle rape|tentacle]] [[penis]]. He claims to hate clichés, yet transforms into a giant monster as the final boss: The biggest fucking cliché of video games. Who by the way looks like the retarded offspring of Ghoma from ''Legend Of Zelda'' and [[your mom]].

*'''Ramon Salazar''': In a twist of fate, Napoleon Bonaparte went into the future and fell into a shitload of toxic waste, causing his legs to shrink to midget size and his voice to sound like a prepubescent boy that just huffed helium. He has two ugly Predator wannabe fuckers that also serve as his sex slaves, one serving as his "right hand" the other serving as his "left"

*'''Bitores Mendez''': Most [[Losers|gamers]] call him the [[Osama bin Laden|"Village Chief"]]. He is one of the first real bad guys you encounter in the game. He's tall, has super-human strength, and looks like he should be playing lead guitar for the band Slayer.

*'''Jack Krauser''': As his last name suggests, he is your stereotypical German: a steroid-abusing, [[batshit insane]] [[terrorist]] with a tentacle arm.  Used to be Leon's [[boyfriend|friend]], but now works with Ada Wong in an effort to make Leon more [[emo]]. 

 [[Image:adawong.jpg|thumb|left|Cocktease.]]

*'''[[Azn|Ada Wong]]''': Her only role is to provide an extra set of [[boobs]] and [[ass]] for [[gamer|gamers]] to watch while Ashley is not around.  [[whore|Wears a high-slitted red dress with heels, and also has an unusually large ass]], regardless of the fact that she is climbing on rooftops and running around rural [[Spain]].  Each Ada appearance leaves Leon more [[emo]] than before.  At one point he [[Auto erotic asphyxiation|tries to choke her]], causing much [[lulz|drama]]. Or fapping if you're [[David Carradine|some sick fuck with an asphyxiation fetish]].
 
*'''The Merchant''': [[The best]] character in the game.  The Merchant is an [[sick fuck|exhibitionist]] who [[stalk|follows]] Leon around to sell him shit.  [[Some argue|Some people]] maintain that he is actually just a down syndrome time traveler with snappy dress sense.  For some reason, he carries FUCKING ROCKET LAUNCHERS around with him, but [[Cunt|won't sell you any of the bullets he repeatedly shows you in his coat and stands]].  Famous quotes include, "WHAT'RE YA SELLIN'?", "WHAT'RE YA BUYIN'?" and "NOT ENOUGH CASH, STRANGER!"  He also flashes Leon everytime you see him for the first time in an area.  It's quite annoying, because to buy stuff you have to close your eyes, open up his jacket, and hope you don't grab his dick while buying weapons.

*'''Albert Wesker''': A complete [[fucktard]] who appears in almost every RE game.  Always wears [[fag|black shades no matter what time of the day it is.]]  His role in this game seems to be... <s>well, he doesn't have one</s> [[ALL CAPS|HE BLEW UP THE FUCKING MANSION AND SHIT AND RAPES ASS ON MERCENARIES MODE.]]

*'''Ingrid Hunnigan''': Leon's [[ugly]] radio contact [[man|woman]] that [[bullshit|gives you useful tips throughout the game]]. [[Not gay|Leon desperately wants to bang her]].

*'''Mike''': A helicopter pilot that you never actually see. He flies too close to the island and gets his ass kicked by a guy with a rocket launcher, because he tries talking to Leon about going to a bar and having gay [[buttsecks|buttsex]] or something, rather than doing what a normal helicopter pilot would do and staying the hell away from the ground. Upon his death, Leon cries out his name as if they were [[Fag|more than just friends]].

*'''[[Buy A Dog|The Dog]] (Hewie)''': A [[Advice Dog|dog]] Leon saved from being [[raped]] by a bear trap. He appears once later during a boss fight and then disappears forever, back into the realms of [[Capcom]].  Because of this, Leon joined [[PETA]] after the events of RE4.  Also, if you don't [[Basement dweller|live under a rock]], you'll know this dog is actually Hewie from another Capcom survival horror game, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haunting_Ground Haunting Ground].  [[Shit nobody cares about|This is why Leon notes that the dog looks familiar or some shit at a point.]]

==Enemies (the [[spics]])==
*'''Los Ganados''': Typical [[European]]s. Angry villagers that throw sharp objects at Leon, maybe hoping he'll get them jobs at Home Depot or something. Their [[violence|violent]] behavior is supposed to be because they have [[evil]], mind-altering insects inside of them... or some [[bullshit]] like that. But [[spics]] always chase after whites with knives, [[amirite]]?

*'''Dr. Salvador''': Commonly called the "Chainsaw Man," this crazy [[fucktard]] [[Ugly|with a bag on his head]] will chop your head off if you don't bust a cap in his ass. Is Jason Voorhees from ''Friday The 13th Part 2''.

[[Image:REWin.jpg|thumb|right|[[A CHALLENGER APPEARS]]]]

*'''Novistador''': These guys mount your face and spit acid on it. You can probably find [[hentai]] of them on [[Fchan|Faggotchan]].

*'''Regenerators''': Gotta shoot the bugs inside of them so they will explode into a shower of...piss? They sound like Beavis. They have Stretch Armstrong limbs, but their [[AIDS|rabies]] infection makes them very [[retarded|slow]]

*'''Iron Maiden''': The exact same thing as the Regenerator except they grab Leon and try to [[rape]] him with spikes.  Not to be confused with the band of the same name, even though [[Irony|that band's mascot is a fucking zombie.]]

*'''El Gigante''': Spanish for "Giant."  Really fucking creative, guys.  Giant [[Sparkling wiggles|muthafuckas]] you gotta fight once in a while. Somehow, Leon can survive getting [[raped|bodyslammed]] by one of these things.

*'''U3''': Not to be confused with [[Bono]]'s band, the U3 is a big, scary monster man that chases you around a bit in a metal contraption. [[Fetish|He will try to ass rape you with his hand, tongue, or giant, barbed penis coming out from his back]]. Vicious.  He also enjoys burrowing in the ground before [[List of sex moves|taking you from below]] in the second part of his [[epic]] battle.  Ya know, after you were sure you [[murder|finished him]].

*'''Garrador''': Meaning "man with claws," it's a man with claws. Just like all the other shitheads in this game, he wants you [[pwned|dead]]. If you're not careful he will, I shit you not, [[skullfuck]] you with his claws.  Also, <s>for some reason,</s> his eyes are sewn shut in order to make his hearing extremely sensitive.  Thus, he can hear almost anything within 50 miles of where he is.  This, combined with his claws, make him a likely candidate for being [[emo]].

*'''Del Lago''': Big monster you fight in the lake. Its name means "from the lake."  Inventive, huh? Anyway, when you kill it, it sinks to the bottom, looking a lot like the end of the movie ''Jaws''. '''[[PROTIP]]:'''Before you get aboard the boat to fight Del Lago, stand on the edge of the dock and fire your gun at the water a few times. This will give you a secret item which makes fighting Del Lago much easier. Same as pressing f10 in [[counter strike]] source.

*'''Colmillos''': You know those dogs from the other ''Resident Evil'' games? Same deal, but with [[tentacle rape|tentacles]].

*'''[[Metal Gear Solid|Snake]]''': Hides in boxes and waits for Leon to break them open. When discovered, the snake bites Leon in the face and crawls away. If Leon kills it, it turns into [[Egg Girl|an egg]]. More than likely an [[easter egg]].  Except instead of chocolate, it's full of snake-poo.

*'''J.J.''': The only black person in the game.  He's a huge fucker with a machine gun, which he fires wildly with little regard to the location of his target, just like his [[IRL]] counterparts.

*'''Verdugo''': Salazar's [[bitch|"Right-Hand"]]. Remember he wears the <strike>black</strike> HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS red cloak? Then, when he comes after you he takes it off, revealing that he is a direct ''Alien'' rip-off. Midget Napoleon's sex slave.  If you happen to be fighting him without a rocket launcher and/or 50 F.aid Sprays, you can knock over the various Nitrogen tanks scattered in the area, making him an [[asspie]] if he walks through it in time.

==The Merchant==
After ''Resident Evil 4'', Merchant moved to the [[America|States]] and resorted to selling arms on the streets.

==Platforms==
Originally the game was promised to be a [[Nintendo]]-only release, until [[Capcom]]  wanted [[moar]] [[profit]] and released it for [[Playstation 2]]. The PS2 version was so shitty (too many load screens, and the bonus outfits didn't even appear in cutscenes...quality product, Capcom) that an extra unlockable outfit, weapons, and more footage of Ada Wong were added as consolation for the [[crap]] platform. [[Gamecube]] owners were annoyed until they realized that seeing Ashley in a [[fatass]] suit of armor wasn't that [[GTFO|enticing]]. It might have made it impossible for anything to hurt her or carry her away, but that's not [[tits|what matters]].

'''Unlockables and Added Content for Different Platforms (aka the PS2)'''

*'''Chicago Typewriter''' - A [[pwnt|kickass]] fully automatic [[Gun#The_Tommy_Gun|Thompson submachine gun]] with [[awesome|unlimited ammo and massive firepower]].  If a player presses the reload button four times with this and have the Gangster outfit equipped, they get to see Leon [[masturbation|stroke his ego a bit]]. Beat Assignment Ada and pay 1,000,000 pesetas to get it.

*'''[[To the max|Infinite Rocket Launcher]]''' - [[WIN|A rocket launcher that doesn't expend after one use.]]  Basically, the only thing you have to worry about with it is [[An hero|blowing your own stupid ass up]], which is [[Centipede filled vagina|more likely than you think]].  Beat the game on normal and pay 1,000,000 pesetas to get it.

*'''Regular Bonus Costumes''' - Leon is reliving [[noob|his RPD day (yes, one day)]], Ada is wearing [[Uncyclopedia|something boring]], and Ashley is being a [[White trash|trashy whore]].  Beat the game on normal to unlock these.  

*'''Better Bonus Costumes''' - Leon is dressed as [[Pretty cool guy|an early 1900s gangster]] while Ashley dons a [[LOL WUT|suit of armor]], making her [[Internet tough guy|untouchable]] and a bigger fatass than before.  Anything that tries to pick her up just [[lol|falls on its ass]] and the metal deflects everything.  All of her [[tits|appeal]] is [[Theft|taken away]], but at least you don't have to worry about her useless ass.  Unlock this by beating Separate Ways.

*'''[[Divide by zero|Professional Difficulty]]''' - For those who actually want a [[A challenger appears|challenge]].  Everything against you is experiencing [[Chris Benoit|roid rage]], and every decent item seems to have [[404 Error|disappeared]] or fallen in number.  Unlock this by beating the game on normal.

*'''Mercenaries''' - An extra mini game that [[Shit nobody cares about|no one cares about]].  The player starts as Leon, going against a clock to try and garner points and shit in order to unlock Ada.  The same goes with every character until you [[Winrar|beat it with them at a 5 star rating, only to get the Handcannon]].  Beat the game on normal to subject yourself to this.

*'''Movie Browser''' - For [[Fantard|fanboys]] who like to [[History|relive]] the shit they barely got through.  Unlock it by beating the main game on normal.

*'''Separate Ways''' - Another side story for Ada, playing the game from [[I did it for the lulz|her point of view]].  This is worth doing for the [[win]] unlockables the player gains from it.  Unlock this by beating the game on normal.

*'''Matilda''' - Yet another [[gun]].  This one isn't really worth bothering with, since it has attributes of a [[Mundane|normal]] gun, [[Fail|must be leveled, and doesn't have infinite ammo]].  Beat the main game on normal and waste 70,000 pesetas for this piece.  The upgrades to make it worthwhile end up costing [[What|233,000]] on top of the base price.

*'''Handcannon''' - The biggest waste of a player's time.  This is [[CP|difficult to obtain]], <s>[[Fail|does not have infinite ammo, uses sparse magnum bullets, must be upgraded, and still doesn't compare to other weapons]].</s> '''[[dumbfuck|IT DOES HAVE INFINITE AMMO WHEN YOU UPGRADE IT,HENCE THE HIGH PRICE]]'''.  To get it, the player must [[Divide by zero|beat every mercenary mini game with a 5 star rating]], then pay no money as a base charge.  However, the upgrades end up costing [[Facepalm|790,000]] pesetas. 

*'''Bottle Caps''' - Utterly [[Virgin|useless]] and only worthwhile to [[leet|elitist fanboys]], these are [[GET|obtained]] via certain accomplishments in the mini shooting ranges found throughout the game.
