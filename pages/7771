Star Blade

''Not to be confused with [[Starblade]].''

'''Star Blade''' is the brain child of [[TL;DR|Lucas Aaron Jadrych]], otherwise known as [[Wikipedophile|Dark-Star]]. Star Blade features the cast of [[Star Fox]], in a totally original vidya game. It fits into the series out of chronological sequence; after the one that really sucked, but before the one that just sucked.

==Idiocy Prevents Game's Release==

The creator has not been able to release the game because, in his words: {{squote|...because [Nintendo and the other big companies] Are Corrupted with Greed and Power, [they] only care for the Money, like you. Money was the First Corruption of man, once it was Descovered, People no longer traded things for the things they wanted, but Used Money(No matter what kind! Gold, Silver, or Paper.) Humans have become Corrupted, but not me, I could care less for the Damn Money! To me, My Dream is worth living in this Condemed Place!}}

But the truth is that he is a [[redundancy|hack fanfic author]], who likes Arwing models made out of Legos. [http://216.92.149.12/fan_of.php?id=15408&sort=id Really.]

==Drama Surrounding the Inspired Work==

On May 27, a user called "Dark Blade" created a page named "Star Blade" on one of the many videogame wikis that litter the internet.. 

[[Image:Star Blade Screenshot.png|Thumb|600px|center|Remember guys, in just a few short years, you can play this masterpiece.]]

A member of the wiki in question edited his user page to inform him of the purpose of the wiki, and to invite him to participate. Several weeks passed until June 14, when that user got an email:

Oh, I see. You Think that Star-Blade isn't going to Come out for Nintendo or at all! Look here Jerk, I Don't Give a F*** if you are the Creator of this Website! I know that My Star Fox Game is going to come out sooner or later! I can't Prepare for that?! I don't Want anyone Messing with the D*** Story that Worked my A** off just to get it up and Running! I don't want all this Lying Bulls*** to be placed on my Game-in-Progress! I know that most of the S*** you have here is Wrong! I could look up a Game that is a Nintendo game and Possibly Find all Sorts of Edited Bulls*** that People placed on them! I am Trying to Keep it Original! I hate it when you People just Delete S*** that you don't think that is good! I was just trying to Get the Word out there to all Gamers, no matter what the System they have is! It could be XBOX360, or Nintedo Wii, or a PS3! I wasn't born to take this S*** from anybody! I was taught that if I wanted something done right, then I have to do it Myself! And Well, I am doing just that! My Game Takes Place in the Star Fox Series, and after SF: Assualt, It is also in the Newest System, that is the Uttmost Beautiful Star System that No One Could have thought of! I do not Believe this S*** about it being deleted because it isn't a "Real Game", Well not yet you A**hole!!! Its a Game in Progress!!! I am also trying to Work out a Title, Thank you!!! I know I sound like a Disrespectful Person, but I worked hard on that Story!!! Now it is all placed in the Waste Basket!! No more of Star-Blade on the Go! I have to do it all over again thanks to you!!!! Deleteing S*** that isn't a "Real Game", What a F***ing Pathetic Excuess!!!!!!!!!! A**hole!!}}

A reply was sent pointing out basic information in any grammar book and pointed out that the game couldn't be made because Lucas didn't have the rights to use the Star Fox property.

Once again, he replied:

{{squote|Hey, Fuck you! I know that it is going to be a Real Game, Because I know. And the Reason why I place Capital Letters is so that you know that I am trying to Make a Point! But you, are such a Dumbass that you didn't even know that!
 
And here are Some reasons why I know that it is going to be a Real Game:
 
1. I have a Creative Mind, unlike you!
 
2. You have no say on what or who I am to be, or what I can and can't do, what I choose is my choice, not yours!
3. I do not try to Humilate people for their Ideas and what they think is what Might happen, Not like you!
 
4. I already Have the Story-Line Written down on Word!
 
5. Unlike you, I wouldn't Delete and Destroy a Person's Dreams of a Possible Future Video Game, I would keep it until that person has either Forgotten about it, or if he or she deletes it themselves, unless they got into an Accident and have to be Hospitalized.
 
6. I just Don't Give a Fuck about People who are Like you, Ass-hole! Hell I don't care if Satan came and started to Beat the Hell out of you! I wouldn't Give the Remotest Damn about you! Hell, I would be laughing at your Damn Ass!
 
7. I try to be nice, until someone like you Pisses me off and then I won't seem so nice, why? Because I would like to sooner kill people like you, myself! But then I would be Committing a Sin, and I would also go to Jail, then when I die, I would go Straight to Hell.
 
8. You are Unaware of who I really am, you have no clue what so ever, on why I am stuck here on this Corrupted Planet and Not with Jesus, and his Father, God. Hell you wouldn't even give the Remotest Damn about the Things that I would Tell you, Things that are True!
 
9. To me, I would like to be your friend, but destroying my Dreams, that kind of Crosses the line! So you have to becareful on what you say and what you do, because I am a person who Has Dreams too.
 
10. I may not have a "Contract" with Nintendo and the Other Big Companies, because they Are Corrupted with Greed and Power, they only care for the Money, like you. Money was the First Corruption of man, once it was Descovered, People no longer traded things for the things they wanted, but Used Money(No matter what kind! Gold, Silver, or Paper.) Humans have become Corrupted, but not me, I could care less for the Damn Money! To me, My Dream is worth living in this Condemed Place!}}

==Dark Star's Dark Secrets==

It is recently uncovered that he is, unsurprisingly, a [[furfag]]. As with anyone who is interested in [[Krystal|anthropomorphic foxes]], he is possibly an [[otherkin]], and a general [[Hentai]] [[pervert]]. His [[MySpace]] page lists his orientation as "Undecided".

==Dark Star's Family==

He apparently has a [[Sockpuppet|sister]] named  Lisa Anne Nasi.  She's as bad as Darkblade himself is.  <s>Maybe</s> she IS him.  Wouldn't be surprising.  He's about as bipolar as a magnet.


{{squote|"I understand that you and Hamzah Abdulah are Using Lucas' Book as a way to make him Fall to Satan's Ways, you will not Prevale Becasue Lucas is the Chosen One and me and mY brothers and Sisters Have Guided him well in the Ways of God, Your Power is thus weaker than a Petty Sister's or even a Petty Brother's So you use one of the things that Lucas holds Dear to him in this World, His Book Dark-Blade Vol.1. Why do you want him to fail so badly? Becasue Your Lord, Satan fears him? Indeed He Should Fear Lucas, For Lucas was trained in our Battling Arena, you will faulter and fail and Satan's Plan to Change him will fail! I can Gurantee you this! Though, for his Book, He is willing to Compormise a "Deal" with your Friend Hamzah Abdulah for it. But she has Not Replied to him Yet, I dislike this Deal, Because I know that it will Involve you! I will Have my Brothers and Sisters Prepared for your arrival, and when you finally enter, We Will Slay you on sight! I care not for a Pathetic, Cowerdace Deal like the one you are focing Lucas to do! You are a Coward! And I will not Accept the Fact that you are trying to Change Lucas, I will Never Accept this! I will Slay you with my Own Hands! Fiend!!"
