'''Imam''' Muhammad "Martin" Luther King, Jr. (الإمام محمد "مارتن لوثر كينغ" ، الابن), was a [[truth|radical communist commando]] who dedicated his [[penis|body]] and [[lie|soul]] to [[rape|inciting violence]] against the [[Ronald Reagan|white man]].  A known [[communism|anti-capitalist socialist]], King [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|supported the immediate execution]] of all [[NORP|middle class whites]] in [[America]], and instituting a [[rap|system of reparations]] to [[butthurt|make up]] for <s>slavery</s> a system of [[Slavery|oversea homestays]] with wealthy families in which one could work [[retard|unskilled]] [[job|labour]] in exchange for [[crack|bartered]] [[Booze|goods]] and lessons in English and [[Mormonism|Christianity]].

[[File:Niggersjews.jpg|left|200px|thumb|To his credit, MILK at least hated Jews (though his nigger brain was insufficient to realize that he would need them for affirmative action).]]

{{Quote|We were told to [[blowjob|promote King]], to [[Race Card|unite Negroes and Whites]] behind him, and to turn him into a sort of [[god|national hero]].  We were to look to King as the [[King|leader]] in this struggle, the [[Obama|Communists]] said, because he was on our side. While in the [[Orgy|party]] I learned that King attended a [[lolwut|communist training school]], that several of his [[bitches|aides]] were communists and that he received [[crack|funds]] from [[Russia|Communists]] and took directions from them. He was one of their biggest [[penis|heroes]]."|Julia Brown, <s>former communist</s> once a commie, always a commie}}

Some argue that imam MLK (as he preferred to be called, MILK) should be remembered for his contributions to equal rights; however, Thomas Jefferson, a prominent founding father, and noted sufferer of Jungle Fever, beat imam MILK by several hundred years by [[rape|demonstrating his own love]] of black [[women|people]], and by providing [[slavery|employment]] for many [[lazy|disenfranchised]] and [[poor|downtrodden]] [[niggers|black youth]].

==Early Years==
[[File:558px-Luther46c.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Martin Luther, author of such books as: On the Jews and their Lies (1543).]]
Imam King, then known by his [[Christian|Western]] name, [[Michael]], was born in [[shit no one cares about|Atlanta]], [[rednecks|Georgia]].  Upon visiting [[Hitler|Germany in 1934]], the family changed their names to Martin Luther, in honor of famous [[truth|Anti-Jew warrior]] Martin Luther.

{{Quote|Jews are a base, whoring people, that is, no people of God, and their boast of lineage, circumcision, and law must be accounted as filth.|Martin Luther, when asked to comment on the Final Solution}}

When King became 13, like many youth today, he decided to [[pretentious|rebel]] against his parents and against [[You|white culture]] by becoming an [[infidel|atheist]].  King later boasted that he [[Objection|questioned]] the [[zombie|bodily resurrection]] of [[Obama|Jesus]] in school, helping to corrupt the youth and to further his Communist agenda.

===In School===
[[File:Niggerschool.jpg|right|200px|thumb|MILK was also an opponent of segregation, which was a law aimed at preventing inevitable riots that result from a critical mass of niggers.]]
As he was, in fact, a black person, MILK had a pronounced [[hate|distaste]] for [[white people|schools]].  A lazy [[crack|drug]] addict, MILK skipped class all of ninth and twelfth grade, preferring instead to spread his [[penis|message]] of [[roofies|peace]] and [[rape|love]] to the [[women|people]].  As a result of his own [[retard|inability]] to keep pace with the students of [[Germany|superior races]], MILK dropped out of high school.  However, he had little business sense or spirit of entrepreneurship, and therefor did not succeed at his first career choice, drug dealer.  Instead, he used the [[witchcraft|powers]] of Affirmative Action (a ritual penned by [[Satan|Aleister Crowley]] in 1934 in order to feed his own cocaine addiction) to gain entry to a local community college.  

Once in college, MILK [[lazy|realized]] that you had to actually work in college.  So instead of getting a real degree, MILK opted to get a [[hippy|liberal arts degree in sociology]].  [[retard|Unable to come up with an original thought]] himself (Niggers lost the gene responsible for this after the fall of Ancient Egypt), MILK resorted to [[lazy|copying]] his final paper from other people.  Because one bullshit degree was not enough to [[get a life|get a job]], he then had a brilliant idea--[[obvious|Christians are stupid!]]  He entered theological [[church|school]] and saved up enough Malt Liquor Lids to get a free mail-order Bachelor of Divinity.  Once out and off parole, MILK spent some years conning [[retards|Christians]] into giving him money.

==Converting to Islam==

This group of burly niggers in funny hats is right.  MILK had grown tired of his [[hippy|nonviolent]] charade and faux-Christianity, and instead decided to return to his black person.  He began to converse with known terrorists, including Elijah Muhammad and [[Malcolm X]], and plotted to commit acts of treason against the United States of America in order to further his Islamist and Communist agenda.

After initially being introduced to Islam and its prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), MILK decided to follow in his leaders footsteps by [[stick it in her pooper|sodomizing]] a [[pedophile|9 year old white girl]].  Upon reaching [[I came|nirvana]] (read: orgasm while balls-deep in [[loli|a nine year old]] [[vagina|cooch]]), MILK decided that he would dedicate the rest of his life to Islam, working as a secret Muslim (a tactic later adopted by fellow Muslim Communist, Barack Hussein Obama), and became Imam and a most worshipful grand master mason of the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.

==On Communism==
[[File:Commiepinkomlkjr.jpg|right|200px|thumb|King, demonstrating his unwavering support for the Glorious Proletariat of the USSR.]]
{{Quote|You [[censorship|can’t talk]] about [[final solution|solving]] the [[poor|economic problem]] of the black person without talking about [[affirmative action|billions of dollars]]. You can’t talk about ending the slums without first [[looting|saying profit must be taken out of slums]]. You’re really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry... Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that [[lie|something is wrong...with capitalism]]... There must be a better distribution of wealth and maybe America must move toward [[communism|a Democratic Socialism]].|MILK on his plan to tax and spend billions of dollars, deny jobs to low-income households, destroy small businesses, trash capitalism, and betray the country to the USSR}}

MILK was a [[lazy|poor]] black person.  Whereas [[truth|all poor people are poor because they are lazy]], and whereas all niggers are lazy, it was inevitable that MILK would blame his laziness-induced poorness on others.  [[Marx|Marxism]] provides the perfect vehicle for this [[shit no one cares about|externalized insecurity]], as it places all of the [[rage|blame]] for ones failures on [[Jews|a mysterious group]] of individuals who extract [[welfare|wealth from the producers of society]].

Later in life, MILK's devotion to the USSR manifested in his opposition to the Vietnam War.  As all [[Republicans|real Americans]] know, the Vietnam War was an effort to [[bomb|distribute]] freedom to [[Communists|Vietnamese citizens]].  MILK, however, said that America "[[truth|had committed more war crimes than any nation in the world]]".  And, in order to demean the brave Americans participating in the [[Ron Paul|Ronald Reagan]] R[EVOL]UTION, said that "[w]hen a [[Ronald Reagan|Hollywood performer]], [[fail|lacking distinction even as an actor]], can become a leading [[rapist|war hawk]] candidate for the presidency, only the [[retardation|irrationalities]] induced by war psychosis can explain such a [[fail|turn of events]]".
