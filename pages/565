Anvil God
{{moar|funny}}
[[File:Anvilgod being summoned.jpg]]

== Origin ==
It all started [[last thursday]], when [[b/|/b/]] massed over to the [[Crap|awesome]] browser based game [[Transformice]]. ( http://www.transformice.com/en/ )

Technically, this [[meme]] originated from [[4chan]], since [[faggots|its users]] were the ones to fuel its popularity and conceived the idea to make this into a [[meme]]. [[Some argue|Some people argue]] that it came from the game instead, even though everyone involved was from [[4chan]]. If anyone tells you that it came from the game and not 4chan, promptly inform them that they are a [[newfag]], and request that they [[GTFO]].

Originally, the Anvil God was known as the Anvil Monster, but through the teachings of the shamans, [[btards]] came to be enlightened to the true nature of the monster and thus began worshiping it.

== Meme Quotes ==

"There is no problem that cannot be solved by Anvilgod."

"Anvilgod. It lives."

"Anvilgod created the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]]."

"Only the most powerful shaman may summon he who anvils"

"Anvilgod is the destroyer of the creator"

== How To Summon ==

1. Select Anvill

2. Press N to select rotating anchor

3. Repeat 6 times, stacking them

4. [[????]]

6. [[PROFIT!]]

WARNING: Anvilgod is a vengeful and indomitable monster.

So, naturally, like 70-100 people rushed over to do it. They were having fun, and the room had a steady population all through the night and into the next day. The [[Moderators|mods]] found out about this, and banned a few of them, but then left them alone once they figured out it wasn't a [[raid]]. At one point, one of the shamans decided to try glitching the anvils. People called it the Anvilgod, and so on. Then  [[fag|faggots]] started repeating it, and the meme was born. So, they banded together, kept [[bumping]] the [[4chan]] thread so it would stay on page 0, and replicated the anvilgod to get the precious screen caps. They made another thread or so, and that's when the [[Original Poster|OP]] gave the idea to make an ED page.

== What It Does ==
It rotates, contracts, expands, convulses, and clusterfucks until [[you]] and everybody else are [[pwn|blasted into oblivion]].

[[Basement-dweller|It rarely appears in person though]], it's time is better spent [[fapping]] to anvilpr0n. It will most likely spread it's virus instead, which clings to the objects around it. If you touch the virus, '''[[Divide by 0|you will be erased from existence]].'''

If AnvilGod REALLY hates you, the lagg will stay until you refresh the page or open a new window. The lagg effects everything, not just your internet browser.''}}
