BFF
[[Image:BFF.jpg|thumb|right|...or at least until that bitch pushes you down the stairs]][[Netspeak]] meaning "next week this [[whore]] is going to sleep with my man and then it'll be an Internet jihad.  May the e-streets run red with her e-blood, the [[cunt]]."

Some people mistakenly assume it's an acronym and translate it as "Best Friends Forever[[oneoneone|!!!1!1!!]]", but experience has shown that the above definition is in fact correct.

Also known as [[gay|BUTT FUCKERS FOREVAR]].
