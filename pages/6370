[[Last Thursday]], Petrozza (Trozza), whose actual name is Louis Petrozza, was a contestant on the show Hell's Kitchen. The show features [[over 9000]] episodes in which the chef, [[England|Gordan Ramsay]] yells and humiliates the contestants as they make [[food]] and [[crap]]. But I digress. Originally from [[Long Island]], Trozza found his cooking [[sex|passion]] after watching his [[Italian]] grandmother cook feasts for the fam. Louis Petrozza was the oldest contestant on the forth season at [[old|forty seven years old]], and was known for his spot on cooking despite being very messy in the kitchen. He is also known for his lulzworthy appearance - a combination of Jew-like eyebrows and Italian skintone (a rarity).  But he seems like a nice guy, which is why every picture is created with [[fail|tender loving care]]. We love him anyway. No, not that kind of love you [[butthurt]] [[fag]].

He was last seen [[kill it with fire|cooking]] some [[ass|beef]] wellingtons. They were so tasty, even [[Gary_yourofsky|Gary Yourofsky]] approved!
