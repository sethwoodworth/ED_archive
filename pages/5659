==Origins==
On or before 30th April 2006, [[MySpace]] user [http://www.myspace.com/hatepantsbad Hatepantsbad] had the idea of making 6/6/6 an Emo Kid Beatdown Day, as evidenced by comments he made to [http://www.myspace.com/thedonlukas Thedonlukas] and [http://www.myspace.com/reptigurl Reptigurl] on 30th April.

The earliest '''National Emo Kid Beatdown Day''' banner was included by [http://www.myspace.com/coolguyearl Coolguyearl] in a comment he made to a [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=8842093 friend] on May 19. By this time, National Emo Kid Beatdown Day had become a common [[meme]] on [[MySpace]]. At about the same time, it become a topic of discussion by [[13-year-old boy|school-aged]] [[punk]]s, such as on the [http://www.totalpunkradio.com/tforum/viewtopic.php?TopicID=3432 Total Punk Radio forum].

It spread to other [[site]]s such as [[LiveJournal]] and [[4chan]] with only a few days remaining before the [[Apocalypse]].

Soon enough the [[emo]] kids began retaliating by [http://forum.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=messageboard.viewThread&entryID=17821198&adTopicID=8&categoryID=0&IsSticky=0&groupID=100083604&Mytoken=6992D96F-E588-4736-80B5471FF1C1F3E01583003265 whining about it] on [[MySpace]]; this of course did nothing and plans to smash the head of every emo possible continued. When the day finally arrived the streets began to fill with emo blood. Emos in their millions began having the shit and teh ghey (too bad it didn't work eh?) kicked out of them and the sales of [[Simple Plan|My Chemical Romance]] records depleted by 99.9%.

==Achievements==
A Filipino emo (gookmo) kid named Paul Clemente was the first victim of National Emo Kid Beatdown Day. He has recently changed his clothing  style, musical tastes and also started loving [[vagina]] making this day a [[win|great success]].

==A New International Tradition==
Norway also has their own Beatdown Day called "Drep En Emo Dagen" (Kill An Emo Day). It lies on the 15th day of December.
It all started on a web-portal for youths named "Hamarungdom" around December 2006 by Drakar. However, it's not about beating up filthy emo-kids; it's more about legally "putting them to sleep", mostly because the police weren't to keen about all the blood and mess which would have filled the streets.

==UPDATE== 
An article was published March 27, 2008, stating that the Mexemos were feeling left out:

==The Second Coming - 09/09/09/==
