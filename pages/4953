'''Loneliness''' is [[angst]] caused by being alone. As lonely people are socially [[retarded]], they are easily influenced by whomever pays attention to them: this is the basic recruiting tactic of [[Furries]], [[Scientologists]], [[Gay]]s, etcetera. A generation of awkward loners, who in earlier days would have done science-fair projects and collected [[comic]] books, have since found the [[Internets]], and are now busy writing clumsy [[slash]] for their [[fursona]]s on [[LiveJournal]].
 
Loneliness is also the root of a wide variety of other societal ills, from [[cutting]] to ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' to [[cybersex]]. The only known cure to loneliness is to take a shower, meet some people who do not wear t-shirts with [[catgirl]]s on them, as well as to stop being such a [[boring]], self-absorbed [[loser]].

If your pick-up skills with the [[16 year old girl|ladies]] are especially abysmal, you may be suffering from [[Chismah|True Forced Loneliness]].

==Existentialism: Loneliness as philosophy==
