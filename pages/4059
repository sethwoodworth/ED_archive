'''Internet Art''', or more commonly known as the ass end of the internet, is when you make a website that looks 
gay as [[shit]] but still call it art. Many of these websites have an [[tl;dr|old skool look to them]] and were originally made to send internet addicts to sleep.

==History==
[[Image:Mayhshit.PNG|thumb|MOAR CRAP]]
It all started when two young men named Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans were looking around [[ED]] and thought the [[Template:Rainbow|rainbow blinkie template]] was the coolest thing [[evar]]. They took some [[LSD]] and started to script the website jodi.org and many others. The sites were major [[fail]] and were left up to serve as a warning to young [[nerds]] to not make anymore. Unfortunately, another fag named Antonio Mendoza made the websites Subculture.com and Mayhem.net. To add to the the [[faggotry]], his sites had a political tone to them and look gay as fuck with shaking images and flashing backgrounds like a mother fucker. Nowerdays the sites are hardly ever updated but still present the threat of more script [[faggots]] making more.
