'''Farfour''' was the lovable [[furry|fursona]] that appeared on Al-Aqusa TV's "The Pioneers of Tomorrow" [[children|children's]] [[television]] show, from April 2007 until May 2007, at which time he was murdered by the plundering [[Jewish]] occupiers in order to obtain the deed to the land that his dying grandfather bequeathed to him. 

Unlike most [[furries]] that are foxes and that have 6 [[penis|penes]] <!-- Penis is the plural of penis, dipshit. (editor's note: NO IT'S NOT)-->, [[Farfour]] was a [[Arab]]-Nationalist Mouse that taught [[Palestinian]] youths the virtues and values of what it means to be the thugs and black person of the Middle East. 

The show featured a call-in segment that allowed children to share their songs and that allowed [[Farfour]] to put the songs into the correct context for maximal [[lulz]].
