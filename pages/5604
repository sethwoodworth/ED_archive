Mygnrforum
Mygnrforum.com is the second worst Guns N' Roses [[forum]] on the net, partially because of the dumb-ass, power hungry, manchild [[admin]]s who spend most of their time on an [[internet]] forum deleting accounts because someone has an [[opinion]] that doesn't agree with them. But is not even in the league with HereTodayGoneToHell.com which is the #1 worst GNR forum.

Mygnr was [[anal]]ly [[rape]]d [[in the ass]] in June of [[2006]] by an elite team of [[hacker]]s called the boon brothers because the admin was too busy stealing [[money]] from forum members and making tons of cash of [[google]] ads to update his forum. 

The forum is divided into two main categories: Axl Bashers and Axl Nut Swingers. Both are irritating whiny bitches who operate on one key principle: I have more posts than you, therefore I know more about Guns N' Roses and my opinion is more valid than yours.

This forum also contains the biggest Axl Nut Swinger of them all "AxlsDisillusion" aka "Jim Bob" who constantly rambles on about how much he hates the old band and how awesome the new band is because Axl Rose picked them out himself. "AxlsDisillusion/Jim Bob" is also a middle aged man who films porno of women who couldn't get picked up by the high end porn sites so they were stuck with him.

It is well known that the fanboy types who frequent Mygnrforum mostly middle-aged internet perverts looking to hook-up with teenage girls (Sixtus).

Troll their shit.

===Ramona===
{{align|center|<youtube>8AwhOe3nIIM</youtube>}}
Known for being the sexiest forum administrator alive, Eric "Up the Wazoo!" Ramona sits atop the throne as King of all GN'R forums. His constant use of the :) smiley illustrates his complete and total appreciation for humankind as a whole. <s>On the other hand, his worse half, Madison, is a complete tool who refuses to post a picture until she finally takes enough of our members' money to afford ''that'' operation.</s> Disregard that, she's fired. Things have really changed since then. Admin recently banned ManetsBR, for posting a tribute band's song in the wrong section. Brilliant job compadre. 
[[Image:Madison.png|thumb|actually... yeah]]

Eric Romano has the coding [[computer science|skills]] of a 12 year old; f you want a reminder of how web pages looked back in 1996, look no further! Eric provides a [[zelda|link to the past]] at [http://www.mygnr.com/ mygnrforum's homepage].  What a beauty.

Protip: If you get banned from mygnrforum, use a proxy and just re-register. Recommendation would be one that is PHProxy 0.5 so you can get past the CAPTCHA. Also, there's other Guns N' Roses [[Banned|fightclubs]] out there anyway.

===Gunsguy===
Gunsguy is a one of the many forum losers who thought it was clever to create a new account as a 14 year old female. Since his [[faggot|old reputation]] was tarnished by his constant stupidity, he decided to start over. Fortunately his own dumbness made it obvious that he was posing as a 14 year old child, and as a result, he was a guest on NBC's "To Catch A Predator." Upon being caught, they found a dildo, and a fagmag in his backpack.  

In addition to pretending to be a 14 year old girl, he also faked legal documents to appear as an "insider."  [[jews|Somehow]], he gained the power to be a "new reporter" on the forum.  Which also apparently means he has pseudo mod powers, since he has locked numerous support threads.  Rumor has it, he performed fellatio on Ramona during the [[Canadian]] GNR tour to get his powers.

===Madison===
Uses [[online dating]] service programs because she can hide her identity (don't believe me? ask Almost Famous). Thus the lucky guy she cybers with won't find out what she's hiding in her underwear when they meet [[IRL]]. 

UPDATE: She recently had all her admin powers removed by Eric for the [[lulz]], which generated a lot of controversy.  She took the [[lies|truth]] to another forum called [[shit|chinese democracy]], which is a far superior forum. UPDATE: She got controversially banned from chinesedemocracy.com.

===Thomas Meadows===
A member of the "United States Elite I Gotta Be In My Basement and Pretend I'm In The Air Force" Division of The Air Force. So far he is the only one that is assigned that job. He also claims to actually be in the air force but mygnr admins notably Madison have claimed otherwise. Some of the allegations against him were saving a village or getting ugly fat girls and even making love to toilet seats at old people's retirement homes. 

UPDATE: He actually posted pics from Iraq, he really is in the airforce. 

''MYGNRFORUM Status:''

TOLD [X]
NOT TOLD [ ]

===BBA===
Short for "Bring Back Adler". He posted under Uncle Buck and dozens of other accounts. He is the greatest troll of MyGNRForum of all time. See urbandictionary for definition.

===Lithium===
Anybody who craves the [[attention]] of others on the internet is an idiot. If these people were to form a group, Lithium would be the ideal person to fuck up their gay club meetingz.

===Axlander/Almost Famous===
Axlander aka Almost Famous is a [[drama queen|teen]] who used to post shit like this: "Axl is the man, who has helped me stay alive. Without his lyrical insights, I know I would not be here today. People can call me a kiss ass all they want, but without the lyrics he wrote, which I found meaning in when the going got tough, there would be no Almost Famous/Axlander."

Axlander/Almost Famous is a kiss ass who thought he was important because he had 15,000+ posts. Idiot.

===luiz===
wnated 2 c gnar in [[mexico]] slsh axel plz

===GUNSNROSES513===
Is a giant [[douche]] and the member with the [[retard|lowest IQ]] on the forum. No one knows where it lives or what it does but it posts regularly over at mygnrforum. Hoping it's rare species will soon be discovered. Sadly he is the only one left. The rest were killed in a mass murder known as the "killing of the giant douches and duchettes". It recently wanted a gun so it would kill all the people who murdered his species. It's also fat and claims to have "lost" weight yet also claims it can lick its own tits, coincidence?

===Chris_Axl===
Known for being a homo queer. Can only communicate through typing since his mouth is mostly full of Axl's cock. Often listens to Contrabland despite his constant put downs of the group. Idiot.  Upload the [[shooped]] guido picture of him here plz thx.

===warchild/Gunzen===
Is a 56-year-old member who used to post ridiculous poetry and rant. Everyone thought he was some guy named Axl. He also used the name Infamous and also posted under a female name Just A Little Patience. He currently posts under the names of "Gunzen" (at mygnr) and "Bumble4tus" (at heretodaygonetohell).

===SunnyDRE===
[[Image:Sunnydre.jpg|thumb|SunnyDRE posted this back when he first joined, perhaps the [[lol|rarest]] pic on the forum]]

black person has a dream!  He also thinks the [[Jews_did_wtc|Holocaust]] never existed, which further proves that he's a fucking idiot.  He called into the [[gay|awesome]] radio show and had the blackest voice on the internet, proving to all doubters that he is, in fact, a typical man living below the poverty line.

Like a true [[racist|genius]], every single thing on the forum is related to race. Do you like that new [[KFC]] sandwhich with chicken for the bread?  Well you're racist bitch, gtfo.

===Iceman24===
A Buckethead fan who dared to say Buckethead was the best guitarist ever in GN'R. After posting PM's from madison he got suspended for a month. He was never allowed to return though, since Madison invented stuff to prevent him from returning. Also his second account, which he was told by the admins, was legal, was banned shortly after rejoining.

Furthermore he is also known for the infamous "Do you have curly pubes?" thread and for clearing the issue whether Buckethead or Richard Fortus was playing the guitar solo on the leaked version of Madagascar, by e-mailing Richard Fortus himself.
He is also known for the "Guns N' Roses guitarist comparison" video on YouTube.

In June '08 his engagement with forum member P.A. Guns was announced on www.mymafiamania.com. In September '09 she dumped him though.

There is an infamous picture of his dick floating around, old mymafia members would know where to find it. It is only refered to as ''the link''.

Iceman24 is known to be a metal warrior and to be mafia.

===Moop===
Was a former member, and was suspended for two weeks because his signature is 1337.  He now has a new name but doesn't post as much anymore. Which makes [[weeaboo|kevin]] sad.

===username===
Is a piece of shit who likes to piss people off, make rumors about other people and have sex with his other online [[Furry]] friends. Yes username is a [[furfag]]. He also hates topics about [[anime]]/[[manga]] and thinks discussion of all comics and cartoons like [[Spiderman]]should be mandatory, when the topic is specifically [[anime]]/[[manga]], should also be included. He also hates it when people don't agree with him and reports them for doing so.

===Stacks On Deck=== 
[[Image:Stacksondeck.jpg|thumb|A real black person on a dad rock forum]]

Makes it rain a mili, a milli, a milli, a milli, a milli, a million times. A million here and a million there.  The only other black member of the forum.  

Despite the misconception that black people don't like rock music, stacks on deck has listened to more music that includes guitars than you even knew existed.  I've been to his house, he has at least [[over9000|400 ]] terabytes of shit.  He even moved beyond listening to music because he is so [[indie]] -- he now listens to plants and space.  Also, he has been reported to be a community college drop out who majored in psychology.

Patron on ice.

===Kevin===
Is the only member of mygnr who supports [[teh]] [[lulz]] and makes any sense. In other words, Kevin is the greatest member on mygnrforum. Since the dawn of [[caveman]], Kevin has been posting and making everyone's day a little brighter each step of the way.  Users like Black Sabbath failed horribly at mimicking his posting style, leading him to fall into a spiral of angst and anger at nearly everyone on the forum (I hate you all).

He is also a giant [[weeaboo]] who wishes he was [[Japanese]].  He fills his time with trying to find [[haxor|miniscule bugs]] and exploiting them, [[autoplay|autoplaying]] youtube videos everywhere omg.

===[[Psychopath|Dexter]]===
Dexter is the moniker under which Guns N' Roses lead singer [[Loser|Axl Rose]] posts. Given that these occasions are both [[Shiny pidgey|rare]] and [[lulz|endlessly entertaining]], [[your mom|most people]] on MYGNR hang around the boards waiting for Axl to come on and [[Rape|strut his stuff]] yet again.

Rose's most famous tirade is a post that went down in MYGNR history the second it was posted, in which he verbally abused administrator [[Grandma|madison]] (who had accused him of banning people wearing t-shirts featuring ex-GNR guitarist Slash from concerts) - an event that spun out of control quicker than you can say "pussy full of maggots" and eventually led to her demoderation, [[Shit nobody cares about|amongst other things]]. Here is what [[Internet Tough Guy|Axl]] had to say:

{{quote|[[tl;dr|What the fuck do you know? That's right! You don't know jack fucking shit you fucking ignorant, know it all, fucking deluded, misguided, self important, self righteous, pious, small minded, clueless, loud mouthed, arrogant ****.

I have to say it saddens me you continue to babble your horseshit to unsuspecting fans n' any names n' numbers you have are of people like you who try n' hurt others to promote themselves at their expense. That's the only real thing you got bitch. It's like Revolver's if not edited, cloudy recollection of events as I've never asked for anyone's shirt bein' thrown out of anywhere let alone say I did but hey he won a contest so he must be credible, whatever, no good deed goes unpunished. I don't work for you or have to do a goddamn thing you think ever. Your opinions of anything whatsoever don't count or mean jack shit to me or anyone in this camp. You're garbage, plain and simple. You're not a fan or a voice of reason... you're a sick n' diseased mind spilling it's bile over the internet. Well now you can drink up the rewards of the crap that's been spillin' out of your pie hole forever here n' enjoy the fermented, feted n' vulgar response you've been cultivating n' aching for... for so long .

[[Image:Trollface_More_HD.png|thumb|right|200px|Axl Rose posting on MYGNR]]
Of course, Eric didn't realize that by the time of edit [[over 9000|every single member of the board]] had quoted Dexter's post, leaving the parts where Rose singled out madison as a "cunt" and a "lesbian" still visible for all.

Sadly, many [[retard|members]] sided with Axl during this whole [[Holocaust|circus]], partly because many were tired of madison running MYGNR like her own little [[Habbo Hotel|Auschwitz]]. Wise people, however, denounced Axl's faggotry and carried on debating for days whether he should be allowed to say such awful things.

|Hey Axl, great to hear from you!|gunsguy, swinging dem nuts

|It´s so sad ... i don´t think Madison deserves this... |[[Wetback| karlossacanell]] ain't feelin' it

|Madison did not deserve that. And what's with calling people "lesbian" as an insult. What a bigot. But we already knew that eh?|evergreen_layne - The Man

|I know what you are doing, you are trying to get Axl to say something to you eh? Hope he doesn't just to piss you off, you think its cool to get the wrong attention eh? Go to the britney forum fool|gunsguy, in response to evergreen_layne. Remember, [[faggot|this guy]] was promoted to moderator shortly afterwards

|Regardless of what you choose to believe - I've been a huge GNR fan from day one. I've followed your music all these years and kept your name and music alive on this forum day-after-day, week-after-week, and year-after-year for eight years - even when there was no news. I've built this forum from 400 to over 35,000 by recruiting members and keeping discussions alive when there was no news.

I'm saddened that you've been given misinformation and question my loyalty to you and GNR.
You couldn't be more wrong.
Peace.|madison showing signs of extreme [[butthurt]]

|MADISON ISN'T A MOD ANYMORE!|[[Caps Lock|Sweet Tooth]], setting the stage for [[moar]] [[drama]]

|whenever Madison was removed as mod I wonder if it was like the scene in "The Lovely Bones" (bad movie) where all the kids who were rape/killed by that guy were set free into heaven, except instead of kids who were molested and murdered it was past members whom madison banned, and instead of heaven its the mygnrforum.|[[wat|Gnr Bar]]

|This whole thing's ridiculous. Madison's always been very supportive of the new lineup and of Axl. It's funny to see people complaining that she doesn't censor discussions because most of the people that get banned are negative trolls. I've never, ever seen her ban someone for being too supportive of Axl, but see how many banned users were whiners and you'll have a long list.

I'm not saying this issue shouldn't have been clarified if it was indeed a false rumour, but I feel like this could have been handled much better.|Estranged Reality, bringing common sense into the discussion after over twenty pages of bullshit

Of course, Dexter fucked off as soon as he hit the Post Reply button, deciding not to meet the shitstorm of arguments rapidly piling up. Instead, he let his little midget housekeeper/stepmother [[Spics|Beta]] monitor the forums for him, as per usual. He hasn't been seen since.

==2005 Was A Travesty==
The year of 2005 brought about a group of GN'R fans who were filled to the brim with cleverness and wit: Rebel Yell, Rim Job, myself, Motley Crue, God, and various other members. Using their extreme levels of humor, they generated lulz in the form of GN'R related comics. Modison, realizing that she was a 40-year old, unemployed Guns N' Roses forum administrator, drank a half a pack of red bulls and worked up the courage to ban these members for completely asinine reasons. Since that day, the group has migrated from Whitedudes Place, to Almost Madison's Palace, and have now settled at [damaged], led by Jemery Bruch, a well-known [[feminist]] amongst the GNR community. [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Damaged]

Since then, MyGNR has been a travesty. Members like Chris_Axl, GNR513, Chris_Axl, and some other [[faggots]] have tried to fill the gaps left by the estranged (you see what I did there?) members, but have ultimately [[failed]].

==The lol bumblefoot Incident==
In July 2008 several forum members posted the message "lol bumblefoot", or "lol Buckethead" after Kevin posted the former and received a warning. This resulted in several people being suspended. Those people were: Dean-16, Hells_Bells, angel of death, UseYourAppetite, junglebaby and tbizzle. All of them, except Dean-16 (a donator), got banned because they were accused of having rejoined the forum under a different name.

On October 14th 2008 the user Martoine was also banned after posting lol bumblefoot but as of yet the reasons for the ban have not been revealed due to censorship from the moderating team. If the reason for the ban turns out to be lol bumblefoot then it would have resulted in a ban without warning.

lol bumblefoot is now a meme.

==How to make youtube videos autoplay==
Well, mygnrforum did not properly filter the autoplay bug, so here is another way around it. Simply use the [media] tags as usual, and just put a normal youtube link in between them.  However, append the following to the end of the youtube link:

'''[[Code]]''': %26%61%75%74%6F%70%6C%61%79%3D%31&player_feature=embed

Happy [[trolling]]

==Word Filters==
Mygnrforum is known for having some of the [[worst|best]] word filters of all time.  Take a look for yourself~

* 5055 = PRIVATE
* nutswinger = **I am a stupid troll;Just Ignore my post**
* faggot = person
* nigger = black person

Don't even try to talk about [[hero|Thomas Meadow]] or the madison situation, the [[mods|human censorship machine]] will stop you before you can blink.

==Eric's Incompetence==
Another stunning example of coding incompetence.  Put this as your sig, edit it into your posts, and have fun:

* [media]javascript://%0awhile(1){alert(document.cookie);}%2F%2F.swf[/media]

What's even better, [[hax0r|anyone]] can run any javascript they want on the site.  People could be directed to phishing pages for example.  An official patch has been released by IPB but [[retard|Romano]] is too busy doing nothing to fix it.  Enjoy having your cookies stolen.
