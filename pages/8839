*[[User:PreciousBodilyFluids|PreciousBodilyFluids]] aka [[User:PBF|PBF]] - October 2010 
:PBF was a [[true|brilliant EDitor]] and constantly went above and beyond the call of trollin', [[IDIFTL|lulzin']] and [[DGT|drama-generating]] duty during his short -but eventful- tour of ED duty.
:Tragically, he was mortally [[glined|wounded]] in [[flames|combat]] towards the end of October, [[2010]] and bid adieu to his [[EDiots|Band of /b/rothers]] with a characteristic [[flounce|low-key]] deathbed [[done with ED|farewell]] in which he asked that he not be mourned and that his heroics be [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|stricken from the record]]. It is only fitting, then, that we at ED [[disregard|respect his wishes]] and move on without him. However, it would be remiss of the Republic of Greater Dramatica to totally ignore his service to [[GV|Queen]] and [[ED|country]] and so with heavy hearts we award [[PBF]] the '''Vox Dramatica''' aka ED's Purple Heart medal for those who have given their lives to The Lulz and The Drama. [[Goodnight Sweet Prince]].

:[[ED]]'s gayest recipient yet! He even has the [[GRIDS]] so please don't touch us!

*[[User:Zaiger|Zaiger]] - December 2010
:Former sysop Zaiger continued to stay on site and do great work even after getting a bit of a raw deal. A free shirt won't make up for months of harassment and frustration in return for years of hard work, but it's all he's going to get.
