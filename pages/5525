'''Msgmcmuffin''' [[powerword|aka]] '''Kevin Lee Mitchell''' (4/18/1991 - 12/10/2010), [[torrent]] king, [[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy|Mason]], and all around [[pretty cool guy]] went missing in late 2010. Months later [[User:NeoLobster|Neolobster]] found his obituary via the google. He died possibly from a [[heroin]] [[hardcore|overdose]].

He is survived by a metric fuck ton of torrent accounts with sweet ratios. Thanks for all the invites, bro! You will be missed.
