Moroveus
The most well-known case of an image bait-and-switch on LJ is probably moroveus' "Operation Jour de Poisson" (French for "Day of the Fish"), in which he changed his userinfo and journal content to appear as a [[Christian]], and created a [[meme]] supporting the phrase "under God" in the United States Pledge of Allegiance. He included code to post which linked an image on his webspace as part of the meme and allowed it time to propagate. After some time, he changed the image to one opposed to the phrase, effectively confusing and angering many Christians and conservatives, as they suddenly found their journals advocating views opposite to theirs. Many other memes have the potential for something such as this, including the hundreds of image-based [[colorbars]]. It is a long time favorite troll on Facebook to create a group exclaiming how great it is to be Jewish, only to switch it to a Holocaust deniers group or Hitler fan club once enough people become fans to create sufficient butthurt and, therefor, lulz.
