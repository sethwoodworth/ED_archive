Kthxbye
[[Netspeak]] for "Ok, thank you. Goodbye!"
 
*Best used in a snarky manner; as in "Zen444...go fuck yourself. Kthxbye." 

*Can also be written as "Kthx[[gtg]]", or "Kthxbai" if you're a [[weeaboo]].

*Other variations include "Kthx[[Suicide|die]]", "[[Stfu]]<nowiki>kthxbye</nowiki>" and the combination of the two, "Stfukthxdie".

*Usually used by scene girls repetitiously in their [[Retarded|very unique]] way of trying to shut you up when you tell them [[Tokio Hotel]] sucks balls.

*Is used by women over 9000% of the time, as women are mentally incapable of comebacks.

*Despite what many faggots who use it will tell you, "kthxbye" is one of the gayest things anyone ever said in the history of [[at least 100 years ago|forever]], challenged only by the phrase "[[List of ways to win at the internet|he/she/I/you won at the internet]]".

*Can be used in place of [[LOL WUT|lol wut]] to definitively end a conversation, or [[bait|flamebait]] a [[butthurt]] [[faggot]].
