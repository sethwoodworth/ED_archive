Abandonware
'''Abandonware''' or "oldwarez" are software (usually games) that are so old [[noone]] gives a shit if you pirate them anymore.  There is a large community supporting the [[communism|free distribution]] of Abandonware that consists mostly of 40-50 year-old [[Unix beard]]s who have and will spend their entire lives [[fap]]ping to the good old days of the PC speaker, [[NES|8-bit graphics]], and completely retarded gameplay.

There are [[at least 100]] websites devoted to the distribution of Abandonware, most of them are in the [[gray area]] legally because they disregard [[copyright]] laws, and assume they can host whatever they want until one of the developers actually threatens them with the [[party van]].  Fortunately for them, the developers of most of the games they host died out at the end of the Cretacious period.  Some sites do, however, host [[Halo|more recent material]] amid large collections of one meg wonders, causing them to get flooded by [[13 year old boy]]s with hard drives chock full of spyware and trojans from the "0-DAY FULLVERSION 100% FREE WAREZ!!!" rat mazes they google up all afternoon.  Thus, many of the bigger sites will [[internet poor|beg you for money]] at every possible opportunity to pay for the high traffic.

*[http://www.hotud.org/ The Underdogs] The biggest collection of oldies on the internets, also the recipient of more legal threats than the tobacco industry; their download servers died ages ago and you can't even get [[bittorrent|torrent]] files from them anymore
*[http://www.abandonia.com/ Abandonia] Almost in the same boat as the Underdogs, you can still probably download stuff at around 4k/s
