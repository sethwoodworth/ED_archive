Foresight FOB
Arriving on /b/ in early September 2009, Foresight FOB is a better deviation of [[Advice Chink]]. Apparently a [[forced meme]], it sucks major balls. However, this is possibly the best thing to have ever come to /b/. Images tend to usually find humor in their racist nature often focusing on the central themes of SAT and eating dogs.
