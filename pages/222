Preparing for Season 7 of their popular show '''''Mythbusters''''', the writing staff at [[I Dunno LOL|Discovery]] were running low on [[shit|ideas]] to film in [[cum|upcoming]] episodes. The "Bismuth or Diamond" pitch proved popular online, and many helpful citizens of the net directed the writers toward [http://www.goatse.cz www.goatse.cz], promising that they'd find proof that hungry goats will swallow a tin can whole. Upon reaching the site, the ''Mythbusters'' development team were dumbfounded, stunned by the impressive width achieved by Kirk Johnson. Planning started immediately, and filming began on [[Jumped the shark|a very special]] "[[Goatse]] Edition" of ''Mythbusters''.

==The Story==
[[Anonymous|Young netizens]] often take [[fap|great pleasure]] in [[sharking|exposing]] the [[/b/|random]] [[pic unrelated|pictures]] left [[haxorz|unprotected on unsecured ftp servers]].  Recently, a 148 MB series of pictures and videos was posted online.  While examining these stolen images, many eager users noticed an eerie resemblance to one of their most beloved television hosts.  The voice in the video was similar to Savage's voice, but without professional voice recognition software, this cannot be reliably confirmed.

Great drama ensued in many forums.  Some believed that the photos busted the myth of normality in the personal lives of television hosts. Others believed that the photos' uncertainty could be exploited for quick [[Internet celebrity|internet fame]].  As yet, there is no proof of the model's identity.  His talent at performing [[Wikipedia:Urethral Sounding|Urethral Sounding]], however, is unquestionable. By all the best accounts, the photos originated from [http://ftpservices.org/private/pictures/]. Advanced WHOIS tech <s>could reveal ADAM SAVAGE, or at least his hosting services</s> done by some [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Adam_Savage#Sex_pictures Wikipedo] reveals it's some guy from New Jersey.

==The Horror...==

{{squote|this is to whomever is posting the photos of Adam naked, my [[13-year-old boy|11 year old son]] woke up early and hopped on the computer to come here to see what episodes are coming up (this is one of his favorite shows) and clicked a photo link (i wont post it here) but the link seems to contain naked photos of Adam Savage, he was terribly upset by these and I feel compelled to contact media sources for scarring my young boy.

this WAS his favorite show, hes been [[BAWWWWW|crying all morning]].

It seems to me the names of these invaders are [[Google_Drop|googleable]] and come back as members of www.ebaumsworld.com

please look into this, and until i see an apology for this consider my family no longer viewers of Mythbusters OR ANY Discovery channel shows, if these are the kinds of perverts you put on air.

thanks. [[Disregard|Oh, and I like cocks]]| [http://community.discovery.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/9801967776/m/8361958869 |Soccerdad1216]}}

==The Reasons Why==
{{squote|Object to seeing a bare-assed Adam Savage?
Why, sirrah, I demand it!
I must say, if there’s any show which would be most likely to have an entertaining blooper reel, it’d be mythbusters.
Adam and Jamie are not Burt and Dom. They use explosives, and science, and explosives, and scuba gear.
Also explosives.
Lotsa fun.| [http://www.metafilter.com/56134/Mythbusters-bloopers posted by Smedleyman] }}

{{squote|My [[16-year-old girl|teenage daughters]] love [Mythbusters] as well. My suspicion is that it's somehow derived from their taste for [[Yaoi]].|  [http://www.metafilter.com/56134/Mythbusters-bloopers | posted by booksandlibretti]}}

==AN HERO: Adam Savage Suicide Confirmed==

Just as [[SomethingAwful]]'s anal bleaching experts began to suspect the pictures were faked, [[troll|tragedy]] struck. [[Original research|CNN reported]] that Adam Savage had [[An hero|shot himself]]. Paramedics found the remains of his head [[Dying alone|face-down in a bowl of shredded wheat.]] [[SomethingAwful]]'s forum members went insane by this obvious troll, and the thread grew very long and totally [[unfunny]].

{{squote| He probably looked at it and said to himself "well, I guess this is all my life is now. A bowl of shredded wheat." and the he put the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger.

[[Image:Adamsavage_wikipedia.jpg|thumb|200px|Wikipedia page, before censorship]]Some insensitive assholes questioned the veracity of these reports. Curiously, while the story was reported CNN and MSNBC, the article on sfgate.com was pulled down soon after it was posted. Is this is evidence of a [[Conspiracy|massive cover-up]]? Does the Discovery Channel have grasping, Jew-like powers over the media? These screenshots were preserved by warriors for truth.

Savage is scheduled to speak at some hacker conference along with Kevin Mitnick and Jello Biafra and some other toolbags nobody knows about on July 18-20 in New York.  This was [http://www.thelasthope.org/news_speakers_announced_levy_savage_mitnick_more.php announced by the conference organizers] after his suicide, so draw your own conclusions.
