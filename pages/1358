Casemod
[[Image:Casemod.gif|thumb|An experienced casemodder turned this into a functioning computer]]
'''Casemodding''' is the practice of either taking a conventional [[computer]] case and making it look really [[stupid]] with blue LEDs and perspex windows, or taking household items and making them look really stupid by stuffing working [[computer]]s into them.

When casemodding, make sure you use blue LED, which will guarantee that your casemod looks cheap, crappy, and derivative.  Ridiculously popular for no good reason.
