Drama bomb
[[Image:Drama bomb.jpg|thumb|245px|A drama bomb being dropped into [[MySpace]].]]

A '''drama bomb''' is a [[cock|complex]] and [[Girlvinyl's vagina|powerful]] [[W|weapon of mass destruction]]  made of [[Drama|pure drama]]. It was first developed by, as everything destructive and evil in the world, the [[Nazi]] Jew [[Albert Einstein]] with [[Al Gore]]'s help, deep underground in the very [[Internets]]' core, a restricted area only accessible to the [[The Internet Is Serious Business|serious business dude]], his wife, and his legendary e-pet (or possibly [[Neopets|neopet]]).

==What is it?==
Unlike the [[Fat|atomic bomb]] or the [[lollercaust]] showers, the power of a drama bomb can [[pwn]] not only an entire [[Japan|place]] or [[Azn|ethnicity]], but the very source of [[lulz]] on the internets if not dealt with properly, a task usually taken by [[LJ Drama]] or the powers that be at [[ED]]. Sometimes drama bombs need not be dropped: the most insidious ones, like mines, rest in the underground, waiting for someone to step (or in this case, [[some argue|argue]]) the [[shit]] out of them. As [[Lesbian invisibility|lesbians]] and [[Heterosexual Invisibility|straight people]], drama bombs can't be seen with [[American|normal]] human eyes. It is rumored that wearing a [[fursuit]] enhances the chances of spotting one, but since wearing a fursuit means you're a [[drama llama|furry]], then you might as well activate the bomb and [[Suicide|speed up your way to Shangri-La]].

==An explanation of the phenomena==
The [[shit nobody cares about|fascinating]] and [[nobody gives a shit|compelling]] process that activates this mythical weapon is based on the infamous '''[[Drama]] theorem''':

<center>[[pwned|pi]] * [[meme|m]] / [[Nazi|n²]] + [[otherkin|0]][[furry|ƒ]] = [[goatse|x]] ± [[Pain series|y]] ∴ [[lol]]</center>

[[IRL]] it goes like this:

* Prima politely asks in a civilized [[Citadel|Internets forum]] where to buy the latest ''[[Harry Potter]]'' movie.
* Secunda steps in and [[The Great Dumbledore Dies Meme of 2005|drops the bomb]].
* Prima, being the [[insane|regular]] [[fangirl|Harry Potter reader]], feels understandably [[Suicide|shaken]].
* Tercera, reading the three posts in the [[Tits or leave|HELP PLZ]] thread, proceeds to announce to Prima that she has been [[pwned]].
* Prima will have none of this, and he summons Cuarta and Quinta, his [[internet tough guy|buddies]], to accuse both Secunda and Tercera of [[Furry|the worse]].
* Secunda reads this while having lunch in his office at his [[Basement dweller|productive job in a very important advertising company]], and summons some [[sockpuppets|buddies]] of his own, accusing Prima, Cuarta, and Quinta of being [[Ann Coulter]].
* The real Ann Coulter steps in and [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|suggests]] that Secunda might just be a [[fucking]] [[bitch]] that enjoys [[Roman shower|unusual showers]].
* Prima proclaims that Secunda has been [[pwned]] in an act of supreme vengeance.
* Secunda's buddy proceeds to type "[[Your Mom]]."
* Sexta, the forum's admin, enters to [[Masturbation|stop the drama]], only to be called a [[wanker]] by Prima.
* Sexta [[Google|finds out]] that [[at least 100]] people think Prima should [[STFU]], and brings down the [[banhammer]] [[in the ass|on his ass]].
* Once again, Tercera announces that Prima has been pwned.
* Prima changes the first three numbers of her IP, and posts [[Mediacrat|fatty pictures]] of Tercera.
* Secunda defends Tercera and argues that said fatty pictures can't be Tercera's, since Tercera was with his [[Jimbo Wales|family]] on [[9/11]].
* [[Taurin Fox]] steps in and proclaims that [[Furries]], [[Otherkin|Otherkins]] and [[Pedophiles]] are now persecuted minorities, fearing the let's-pray-to-[[god]]-it-comes-tomorrow [[Furries#Furry_Holocaust|Furry Holocaust]]. All while crying out [[OMG]] [[Fursecution|FURSECUTION]][[Oneoneone|!!!!11!!1]], of course.
* Meanwhile, Cuarta backstabs Prima, going [[batshit]] about how [[Illuminati|9/11 is a government conspiracy]].
* On the other hand, Tercera is [[what-EVER|outraged]] with his fatty pictures emerging [[OL]], and hires an [[e-lawyer]] to take [[legal action|e-legal action]] on Prima's [[ass|e-ass]] at [[internet court]], charging her with [[slander]] and [[stalker|stalking]].
* Septima, witnessing the [[lulz]] and abiding by [[Godwin's Law]], resorts to the [[Fifty Hitler Post]].
* Somewhere in-between the [[Your Mom]] and [[STFU]] use, [[Octomom|Octavia]] mentions how [[MONGO]] [[allegedly]] [[in the ass|takes it like a man]], resulting in MONGO [[deleting your LiveJournal]] before the [[internet police]] arive.

By this point, the Internets themselves have exploded amidst [[conspiracy]] theories and [[JEWS DID WTC|9/11 memes]], leaving only the [[lulz]] archived by [[LJ Drama]] behind, which will remain in the Internets and taint whatever site appears there [[goatse|forever]] more.
