'''Sonic the Hedgehog''' ([[powerword]]: [[Shit nobody cares about|'''Olgilvie Maurice Hedgehog''' to]] [[Furries|Archie Fags]] [[Shit nobody cares about|and]] [[Resident Evil 5|'''Chris Redfield''']] [[Shit nobody cares about|to]] [[Spax3|Voice Fags]]) is essentially the [[video game]] equivalent of [[b/|/b/]]; [[Truth|was never good, never will be]]. Anyone who tries to say otherwise is either [[Chris-chan|an asspie]], an [[oldfag]], a [[fantard]] or a [[furfag]]. Most likely the latter.

Created by [[Sega|a trio of Japanese video game making furfags]] as a successor to [[failure|Alex Kidd]], Sonic himself is essentially like a faggot who makes claims to have once been as cool as [[you]], but no one can remember why. He can run over 500 mph on land, 700 mph on the Autobahn, and [[yiff|15 mph up Tails' ass]]. Sonic zipped through the semen-speckled world of the furry fandom in 1991. "The more the merrier!" laughed the furries, and since then, the pincushion has become prime rib for masturbatory fantasies, fanart and fanfiction; especially on [[DeviantART]].

After a mere two or three games, games even ED's own [[Special:ListUsers/sysop|staff]] could agree on "[[Bullshit|as decent]]", Sonic [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTMv3t9GCw followed his rainbow] and did a [[Barrel Roll|U-turn]] straight into [[Fail]]town. It is at this point that the Sonic games went from Sonic and his [[faggot|trusty sidekick]] Tails fighting the forces of Dr. Robotnik to an abundance of [[Tracing|ORIGINAL CHARACTER COPYRIGHT ME ^_^]] everywhere. Because what's better than racing at super fast speeds, ricocheting off spring-a-ma-jigs, [[Divide by zero|HOLY SHIT RUNNING UPSIDE DOWN]], and [[Zinedine Zidane|head butting]] robots? Give up?! It's a horde of [[Mary Sue|unlikable characters]] spooged all up in your face. It should also be noted that Sonic is the preferred template material of all the disgustingly horrible "fan-made characters", 90% of which are hedgehogs.

However in the year 2009, Sega decided to do something that would blow the shit out of our asses by making an episodic '''[[OH SHI-|2D Sonic game]]''' called ''Sonic the Hedgehog 4'', - previously under the codename of ''Project Needlemouse'' - rebooting the franchise once again and continuing from where ''Sonic 3 and Knuckles'' left off and might be Sega's last chance of doing justice to this beaten series of [[AVGN|shitty games]]. After all, it worked for [[Capcom]]'s [[Mega Man]] [[win|9]], so why not with Sonic? Simple, because, as previously stated, Sonic was never good.

And he never will be.

==The Series==
===History===
[[Image:Tailswut.jpg|thumb|150px|Tails is just as confused as you are.]]
[[Image:Irl sonic.jpg|thumb|[[Typical]] reaction to Sonic fans.]]

Sega, realizing how much Alex Kidd sucked cocks big time,The Japanese  decided to rape the faggot and think of something gayer in order to compete with [[Nintendo]] and it's mascot, [[Mario]]. Eventually, they contacted three Japanese people to think of something more failtastic than Alex Kidd:

* ''Naoto Oshima'', a Japafur that spent his days fapping to [[American]] furfaggotry such as Looney Tunes; called by Sega to design the character for the game
* ''Yuji Naka'', a programmer and [[Kanye West|college dropout]] who made [[lolicon|Girl's Garden]], and later on in his life had also claimed to have [[Divide by zero|created a NES emulator for the Mega Drive / Genesis]]
* And last but not least, ''Hirokazu Yasahura'', a level designer that could only produce [[shit]]ty levels that had a major flaw; just hold forward on the D-pad and you fucking win the stage.

Before creating the game, however, [[Furry|Naoto]] was thinking (shocker) which [[animal]] would be unfortunate enough to be Segaraped, and let Naka and Yasahura decide the animal for him. Candidates of the "main furfag star" debate were a bulldog and a rabbit; among other rejected shit. It then finally fell down to the [[win|armadillol]] and [[fail|hedgehog]]. The event settled on the hedgehog becoming victorious, and so began the epic failure.

The original idea was a character known as Mr. Needlemouse and a [[pedophile|fatass in pajamas]]; it was eventually reworked into the blue furry faggot we all know and [[Hate|love]] and the fatass who loves and supports [[fursecution]]. You might think that because Naoto was the one who came up with Sonic in the first place, many of the Sonicfags would be kissing ''his'' ass. However, in a strange turn of events, Naka and Yasahura would be the ones to be known as the creators of Sonic the Hedgehog, [[lol|forever stealing the credit from Oshima]], [[butthurt|who responded by leaving SEGA years after]]. A couple years later, Naka and Yasahura, realizing how much Sonic sucked, (TOOK YA FUCKING LONG ENOUGH) left the franchise and company, leaving it's fate in the hands of A MOAR [[noob|n00bier]] developer ''Takashi Iizuka''.

In the 16-bit days, Sonic was one of the most popular game mascots and ran head-to-head against Mario. But this lasted for about a couple years, because after the failure of the Sega CD and 32X, everybody [[Shit nobody cares about|stopped giving a shit]] about [[Gay|Sonic]] and [[fail|Sega.]]

During the Sega Saturn era, in an attempt to make people give a shit about Sonic again, there was going to be a Sonic game for the Saturn called ''Sonic X-treme'', and it would have been the first 3D Sonic game ever, had it'd been finished; Sonic X-treme went to development [[hell]], and eventually was canceled and replace with a Saturn port of ''Sonic 3D Blast'' instead.

In [[90s|1998]], however, the series eventually [[Exploding Van|blasted]] into 3D on the [[Dreamcast]]. The first 3D Sonic game, ''Sonic Adventure'', dared players to "[[extreme|up the ante]]" by rendering holding right obsolete, inspiring dozens of imitators with its revolutionary upward D-Pad holding; as well as a cast of barely original recolors.

Unfortunately, the [[gay|charming]] character stood no chance against [[Sony]]'s [[Playstation]], which effectively [[pwnt]] Sega. Eventually, everybody stopped giving a shit about Sonic, and Sega stopped making their own consoles, instead focusing to develop games for their previously-once enemies, <s>destroying any potential win they had</s> (like they ever had any). Afterwards, [[win|most of SEGA's true fans killed themselves, and so nothing good was ever said about Sonic and it's company after that.]]

Financial success was still made with the games, but SEGA didn't feel as if the series was badass enough. In a failed attempt to look cooler, [[cutter|Shadow]] was given his own game, along with a [[chasethehedgehog|gun and a motorcycle]]. Here, a particularly deft brand of skill is required, as the player must reconcile the concepts of holding up on the D-pad, jumping, shooting, and cutting yourself AT THE SAME TIME. The game blew chunks.

The big blow dealt to the series, however, was the release of ''[[Lazy|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PS3]] (discriminated with names such as ''Sonic 2006'' or ''Sonic 360/PS3'', also discriminated as ''Sonic the Disaster'' to [[Spax3|some]]). Filled with a plothole stricken story destroying what was established in the old games, four new unlikable [[Mary Sue|chara]][[Recolor|cters]] and glitches galore, it was the most negatively received Sonic game in the series, and everyone hated it. With the exception of [[Chris-chan|the most retarded Sonic fans]].

Nowadays, Sega produces Sonic games (or better said pumps then out) for the [[Furries|type of customers who still love cartoon animals]]. As of [[2007]], Sonic is more-or-less a Nintendo [[bitch|character]] since he starred alongside Mario in a game involving the [[Special Olympics]] and ''[[Super Smash Bros]] Brawl''.

===Game Play===
[[Image:Sawnik_Physics.jpg|thumb|300px|Demonstrating Sonic's [[shit|'''amazing''']] physics.]]
<strike>The objective of the first Sonic the Hedgehog video game is to hold the D-Pad right for 15 minutes straight, occasionally pressing a button to make him jump. The gimmick, you see, was that you could go ''fast''. Collect kaos emeraldos. The idea was that looked even more like a drug fantasy, with levels consisting of surreal acid-nightmares inhabited by strangely [[penis|phallic]] robots and a [[Ron Jeremy|fat man with a mustache]].</strike> See [[Mario]].

===The Games===
[[Image:Cardcrushsonic.gif|thumb|right|[[Card Crusher]] demonstrates the premise of every Sonic game, evar.]]
[[Image:Shadowretarded.jpg|thumb|right|Behold the [[fail|awesomeness]] that is Shadow the Emo-hog.]]
[[Image:GCZact2.gif‎|thumb|[[lollercaust|Genocide City]] shows how great the level design is in Sonic games.]]

[[Image:Sonicwerewolfnewgameplay.PNG|thumb|Leaked [[porn|photo]] from Sonic unleashed.]]

*'''Sonic The Hedgehog''': The game that started it all. No other characters besides the little blue furry faggot himself. Your job is to break Robotnik's shitty robots and collect Chaos Emeralds in [[Special]] stages, or at the ending an animated [[GIF]] of Robotnik shoving the [[Rocks|emeralds]] in his fat ass will play. The funny thing is even though it was the first Sonic game, it's probably the most shittiest of all the Sonic side scrollers.
 
*'''Sonic The Hedgehog 2''': Essentially the same game, except you now have a [[Tails|new friend]] who follows you around stealing your air bubbles in water levels and generally making the game more faggy than it should be. This game revolutionized the series with the introduction of [[DBZ|going super]], where collecting all the Chaos Emeralds caused Sonic to turn [[Asian|yellow]] and run [[omg|even faster]].

*'''Sonic [[Computer|CD]]''': Sonic travels through time to hunt down Dr. Eggman. Sega employed a cunning marketing strategy with this game by adding a female character, thereby attracting the straight furries as well as the gay ones. By traveling trough time, Sonic can go to the past, where everything is rather [[retarded|primitive]], or to the future, where the world can be either [[gay|bright and happy]] or [[b/|chaotic, deadly, and dark]]. Amy and Metal Sonic also caused the [[Eternal September]]. Shame nobody ever owned a [[Fail|SEGA CD]].

*'''Sonic The Hedgehog 3''': The third game introduced yet another recolor, this time named ''Knuckles''. Sega attempts to pull the wool over our eyes by coloring Knuckles red. Of course, we all know [[Black|what color he's supposed to be]]. That, and [[Michael Jackson]] made the music for this game, adding to it's gayness.

*'''Sonic & Knuckles''': A "continuation" of sorts of ''Sonic 3'' that allows you to [[Anal Sex|lock on]] ''Sonic 2'' & ''3''; if you lock on ''Sonic 1'', you get a [[Shit nobody cares about|Blue Sphere minigame]] and [[Copypasta|Knuckles in Sonic 2]].  Considered by many Sonic [[fan]]s when locked on with ''Sonic 3'' to be the best Sonic game ever. But that isn't really saying much.

*'''Knuckles Chaotix''': <s>Un</s>fortunately, nobody remembers this game because no one ever owned a [[Cancer|Sega 32X]]. It was originally gonna be called Sonic [[white|Crackers]] but Sega pulled a last-minute idea out of their ass by adding Knuckles and his [[black|gang]]. If you've seen gameplay of this, you'll know that SEGA has a bondage fetish.

*'''Sonic 3D Blast''': Moar liek [[Fake|Pseudo]]-3D blast amirite? Since SEGA was too fucktarded to program an actual 3D game, they made this thinking nobody would notice that OMG IT'S NOT 3D. Basically you run around on a shitty checkered platform fucking [[GAY|purple]] robots to [[Rape|collect]] "[[Penisbird|flickies]]" before Robotnik molests them. The game was ported to the SEGA SATURN and PC decided that releasing a full 3D mainstream Sonic game wasn't XTREME enough for them at the time. One of the beta versions of the game features [[:Image:DOWN_SYNDROME_SONIC.png|a lulzy picture of Sonic in which he looks like he has]] [[Down Syndrome]].

*'''Sonic the Fighters''': [[Shit nobody cares about|Also known as Sonic Championship in America due to the fact SEGA was too scared to release a game as violent as this]], [[Fail|this game was released on arcade instead of SEGA's own dying console]]. There was a plan to port it over to the Saturn but the game sucked anyway.

*'''Sonic R''': Sonic Racing game where everyone except for Amy and Robuttnik run around a grand total of 5 different tracks while the most boring singer in the world sings songs arranged entirely in rhyming couplets. There is a legend that if you play tag as [[Tails Doll|Tails Doll]] on Resort and tag [[DBZ|Super Sonic]] last, then [[you|Tails]] [[penis|doll]] will come out of your screen and [[rape|kill you]].

*'''Sonic Adventure''': And so SEGA finally decided to make Sonic transition to 3D by bringing in the tried-and-failed high speed gameplay of Sonic & Tails with [[Shit nobody cares about|treasure hunting, shooting, fishing (yes, FISHING), and hubworlds]]. Basically, SEGA tried to being badass in so many ways possible, but failed as they always do. Still, we'd rather play this instead of pretty much anything below it.

*'''Sonic Pocket Adventure''': A game that SEGA was dumb enough to release on a SNK console. SEGA obviously released it on an SNK console for the lulz, feeling sympathetic for [[Irony|a company that was going to go bankrupt and bought by Pachinko Machines.]]. Shame nobody ever played the supposedly [http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162670p1.html best game ever made] because nobody owned NEO GEO POCKET COLOR and holy fuck does that sound gay.

*'''[[Trolling|Sonic Shuffle]]''': Pretty much ''Mario Party'', except [[Gay|different]]. It is impossible to win this game.

*'''Sonic Adventure 2''': Sequel to Sonic Adventure. Is 10X more emo due to the debut of Shadow.

*'''Sonic Advance''': Boring sidescrolling game for the Gameboy Advance. It was also on the [[wut|Nokia N-Gage]], but nobody knows that because nobody would ever buy that shit. You can play as all the furries: Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Knuckles. It had two sequels, but they were just as shitty as the first one.

*'''Sonic [[An Hero|Heroes]]''': SEGA decided to make Sonic gayer by copying off Power Rangers or some shit. It was gay.

*'''Sonic Battle''': As if Sonic the Fighters wasn't bad enough, Sonic returns to kick the crap out of his friends again. The battles use [[Super Smash Bros.|the original concept of pitting 4 characters against each other and fight to the death.]] Like in ''[[Soul Calibur]]'', you win by pressing the "B" button a lot.

*'''Sonic Rush''': The game that introduced [[Zippocat|Blaze The Cat]], a whore from the future. Considered by many fantards to be a major break from the shitty 3D Sonic games. But the things, how can you consider shit to be a break from shit? BECAUSE THIS GAME IS SHIT.

*'''Shadow the Hedgehog''': The most emo game on this list because it stars Shadow. SEGA decided to make Sonic games more [[gangsta|darker and edgier]] by adding pointless mechanics such as [[Fail|guns, vehicles, and cussing]]. The game featured 10 endings, with the secret one having Shadow putting his past behind, having finally found the [[buttsecks|answer to it all]]. This game is also the progenitor of the fandom's two most significant yet extremely unfunny memes: "[[Find the Computer Room]]" and "[[No Cussing Club|Where's that damn fourth Chaos Emerald]]".

*'''Sonic Riders''': Because Sonic R just wasn't [[extreme]] enough, Sonic and Co. are given some hoverboards that [[steal|rip off]] the ones from [[80s|Back to the Future]] and compete in [[EXTREME]] races with three [[YOU'RE A BIRD!|birds]].

*'''Sonic The Hedgehog Genesis''': A shitty attempt to port ''Sonic 1'' onto the Game Boy Advance for some quick cash. Failed so hard that even the most rabid Sonicfag would think twice before buying it. Think about that for a second. Srsly.

*'''Sonic The Hedgehog (2006)''': ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PS3]]. The developers were too busy eating [[Feces|lunch]] or something to think of a more original name like... well, anything else really. And worse, they  couldn't even think up any actual gameplay that isn't total fucking shit. In this game, Sonic must save a princess from Dr. Robotnik; Now doesn't that [[Mario|sound familiar]]? There is an ongoing romance between the (human) princess and Sonic, thereby proving that everyone at Sega is into bestiality. Although Sonic had always sucked, this game sucked '''notably'''.

*'''Sonic Rivals''': A racing game that's still [[moar]] extreme than the horrible ''Sonic R''. You also [[Yu-Gi-Oh|get cards]]. Has a sequel, but [[no one]] cares.

*'''Sonic & The [[Trap|Secret]] Rings''': Sonic gets trapped in an ''[[Iran|Arabian Nights]]'' book and must collect some [[crap|rings]]. It sucked, as well. A lulzy quote by Sonic in the beginning: "...so who's this Genie who wants to destroy reality again?"

*'''Sonic Rush Adventure''': A sequel to ''Sonic Rush''. Sonic gets stuck on an island after his plane crashes because he was too busy fucking Tails to actually fucking navigate the damn thing. It introduced Marine, a lesbian [[loli]] raccoon with annoying Aussie dialogue, who basically orders Sonic to do everything for her including a daily cock stroking. Same old shit.

*'''[[Mario]] & Sonic at the [[Special Olympics|Olympic Games]]''': Sonic and his friends find some plumbers, a giant turtle, and two princesses, and then they compete in the Special Olympics. Nobody gives a shit about this game now, due to Sonic being in ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl''. At least Amy's in a leotard, so sick fucks looking for their [[panty shot]] remain denied to this very day.

*'''Sonic Riders: '[[Divide by zero|Zero]] Gravity''': The prequel wasn't XTREME enough, so now you get to fuck with gravity. Wheee! 

*'''[[Super Smash Bros.]] Brawl''': Masashiro Sakurai decided to put Sonic in this game to ensure that the furries who preferred Sonic porn over the generic furry kind would shell out their [[Jew gold]]s for it. No one besides the aforementioned furries uses him.

*'''Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood''': This game is proof that no developer could ever make a good Sonic game. Ever. BioWare, the people who made Mass Effect and some [[Star Wars]] and [[Dungeons & Dragons]] games (all of which are proclaimed to be fucking awesome), tried their hand at making a Sonic RPG. But not even these [[USI|self-proclaimed game-making geniuses]] from Canada could scrub the stench of fail out of Sonic. The result was this piece of shit.<br/>Some Ausfags got this game early and managed to beat it really fast, and then leaked the entire plot to the rest of the world. Lulz and butthurt ensued when people learned about the ending. 

*'''Sonic Unleashed''': Eggman finally figures out that draining Super Sonic's powers is the key to beating him. Gee, draining powers from a superhero. Who would've thought? Anyway, unfortunately for the world, it ends up turning Sonic into a [[furry|werewolf]], thereby taking him from merely 'furry' status to 'MEGA FURRY SAMA KEKEKEKEKE'. On the other hand, Sega decided to do away with all of the fail recolors, leaving only his shota buttbuddy and his prepubescent stalker fangirl, but decided to add a floating mystic rodent thing named Chip, who competes with Tails for the prize of being Sonic's gay lover.<br/>This game includes a mission where Sonic helps an unemployed [[New York]] [[pedophile]] groom a four-year-old Italian [[loli]] by delivering gifts from her [[wishlist]] over and over and over again. Her [[old|grandmother]] desperately begs you to stop luring the girl into a lifetime of sexual slavery, but Sonic tells her to [[GTFO]]. There's also a stereotypically gay man in this, but even SEGA failed at making that kind of joke.

*'''Sonic and The Black Knight''': Basically, Sega got tired of ripping off Mario for all these years and decided to rip off Zelda instead. He's got a [[sword]] in this one. With this installment, it became clear that SEGA was taking too many ideas from the fandom.

*'''Mario and Sonic At The Winter Olympic Games''': Probably one of the few games with the longest fucking title in existence, this takes place at the Vancouver Olympics. Features new participants, like Silver, Donkey Kong, Metal Sonic, and Bowser Jr.. Silver [[masturbation|beat out]] Rouge to enter.

*'''Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing''': Sonic goes right back to ripping off Mario, but decides to drag other SEGA franchises with him. Amazingly, this game has gotten better reviews than his own mainstream games, though it probably sucks anyway. It's a Mario Kart rip-off with SEGA characters, nothing more.
[[File:Sonic-dance-o.gif|thumb|Sonic does this for 23 minutes at the end of Sonic 4]]
[[Image:Sonic Comparison.PNG|thumb|[[Typical|Sonic Fans proving yet again they are more capable of making better Sonic games than Sega ever could.]]]]

*'''[[OMG|Sonic The Hedgehog 4''']]''': '''Coming to terms with understanding that the preceding hundred Sonic games listed here are [[shit|fantastic]], Sega decided to return to their roots in milking a fluke franchise with more sequels. [[Shit nobody cares about|Sonic 4 promised to return to the first side-scrolling Sonic games, the only playable character will be Sonic and it has been confirmed to be available for XBLA, PSN, and WiiWare, though the game is in the style of the classics]]. [[I came|Fans are excited]] but, [[smart]] people know it's just Sega trolling their fans. Instead of releasing the whole game at once, Sega decided to release the game in parts as [[Star Wars|"Epis]][[Doom|odes"]], to milk out some more [[Jew gold]] off of the fans. Sonic fans are once again saying that this game has redeemed the franchise, just as they have been saying in last [[Over 9000|5]] years; while [[Sonmanic|others]] are boycotting Sonic 4 because of [[Shit nobody cares about|Sonic still having green eyes and Robotnik still being called Eggman]]. As many [[Furfags|Sonic fans]] hoped this would be the triumphant return of the once [[Lies|respected]] Sonic franchise, the game was a [[Truth|piece of shit]]. The game had [[Ragdoll Physics|horrible physics]], craptastic graphics and [[Copypasta|every level and boss is a rehash from the first two games]]. To make matters worse, there's a fan game that's being worked on titled [[Shit nobody cares about|Sonic FanRemix]] which actually has decent graphics and physics that actually work! What's even [[Unfunny|funnier]] is that Sonic 4 had a team of at least 100 [[Shit|professional]] developers with a budget [[Over 9000|over 1 Million]] [[Jewgold|dollars]] and they make a shitty game that loks even shittier when compared to a game of [[Hobo|little-to-no budget]] made by only [[Basement dwellers|3 people]]. Yeah, nice going Sega; [[Fail|the company that even its fans can make better games than you can.]]

[[Image:Sonic_colors_stfu_wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Holy fucking shit SHUT UP.]]
*'''Sonic [[Homosexual|Colors]]''' ([[shit nobody cares about|also known as Sonic Colours in non-US regions]]... and I'm not even making this shit up. That name really is that gay): As most Sonicfags are currently fapping to Sonic 4 (developed by DIMPS), the other devs got high and are releasing a Sonic about fucking colors. A Wii/DS exclusive (and as a result, pissing off fans of the 360 and PS-Triple) that is supposed to have flying [[shit|aliens]] that give Sonic [[gay|superpowers]] while most players will probably die of seizures, either at how much this will suck or how [[gay|colorful]] it is. Not much is known as of now, but all will be revealed [[Last Thursday|at presumably E3]]. Some fans are claiming this to be a ripoff of Mario Galaxy, when the only real question is why they're still playing Sonic games. The trailer's pretty gay too.
<br>
{{rainbowsmall|THE COLORS FEEL SO RIGHT}}


*'''Sonic Free Riders''': Deciding that two of these Tony Hawk rip-offs weren't EXTREME enough, we have Sonic Free Riders, a [[Retarded|game where you move without a controller]]. Compared to other KINECT games, this admittedly is one of the few that look like the least like fail. Much of hate towards to this game comes from the fact that nobody fucking likes KINECT. Still, it's Sonic, so it automatically [[Fellatio|sucks]].

=== Unreleased/Beta Stage ===
*'''Sonic The Hedgehog (SATAN)''': A game for the megashit/genesissy that was never made. It was being designed after the cartoon series of the same name. Sega soon after releasing a few pictures and a video of gamelay realized that the idea sucked, Sonic sucked, they sucked, and were gay so they killed themselves after having a gay buttsex orgy.

*'''Sonic Crackers''': The one and only Sonic Game to be programmed by a nigger (explains why Knuckles replaced Sonic as the protagonist later on). Its soul purpose was to "stick it to the white man" but Sega soon realized the fail in the black mans attempt to troll, and was later remade into Knuckles Cowdicks for the 32ECKS.

*'''Sonic X-TREA[[Spax3|B]]''': Planned to be an answer to the rise in so many 3D games, the game was so awful that one guy who was making it got pneumonia, and so the game was cancelled. It should be noted that you get cardiac arrest if you play what was left of the game, which is why it hasn't been released in any way possible publicly. There was also a planned fangame based on this called Project S, until the lead designer decided to cancel it, even though everybody knows nobody ever cared about making it.

*'''Sonic Adventure (N64)''': LOL WAT THE FUCK R U DOIN?

|0}}

==Animated==
===The TV Shows===
[[Image:SonicXposter.jpg|thumb|Sonic [[Porn|X(XX)]]]]
*'''Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog''': [[Some argue]] that this is [[the best]] Sonic show, and even though they're all [[gay|retrofags]], they're right anyway since all the other shows are ''even worse''. Basically Sonic and Tails run around talking about stupid bullshit while Robotnik and his three moronic sex slaves plot to kill them. Said love-squad is composed of Scratch (an [[furry|anthro]]-chicken-robot), Grounder (a dick-nosed-lummox on tank treads with dicks for hands), and Coconuts (a monkey robot that is even more incompetent than the first two), all of whom try to catch Sonic. At the end of every episode, Sonic tells us all what we learned today, especially about [[alcohol|booze]] and [[pedophilia]]. [[Seriously]]. These messages are the show's sole source of lulz. As of late, this show has become a prime source of material for [[YouTube Poop]], especially Robotnik's [[PINGAS]]. One might not be surprised to hear that Robotnik's voice actor was openly gay.

*'''SATAM''': This show is [[emo|darker and more sinister]] than ''Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog'', but at least this one doesn't have the retarded Sonic Sez segments. In this show, Sonic, Tails, and a bunch of other [[furries]] are hiding in a forest from a more evil Robotnik (who is now a HUGE fatass with a creepy and sinister voice), his [[midget]] Jew nephew Snively (note the massive nose), and his army of robots (that look like recolors of the Horde Troopers from She-Ra). It also features the catchphrase "[[extreme|Let's do it to it!]]", thereby making it ALMOST as gay as Sonic Heroes, though admittedly more badass. The vile [[comic|Archie Comics]] version of Sonic spawned from this show, as well as Princess Sally Acorn, a chipmunk who is even MORE annoying than Amy Rose; Bunnie Rabbot, a cyborg [[Bulling is rabbit|rabbit]] with a metal crotch (ouch) and a [[W|Texas]] accent; Antoine, a cowardly coyote (who is also [[france|French]]); and a whole bunch of other characters no one cares about. This show is gay, avoid at all costs.

*'''Sonic Underground''': This show, originally in French, was thankfully short. It involved Sonic and his two pallete swaps, [[cuntpaste|Sonia]] and [[copypasta|Manic]], all three of whom were voiced by Steve Urkel. You can imagine how confusing it must've been for the three hedgehogs, all having the same voice. They also get musical instruments to fight Robotnik this time, even though it was already established early in the franchise that hedgehogs can rip through a steel tank by spinning. Knuckles also makes a few appearances, as do a couple of the Chaos Emeralds. Other than that, it's pretty much the same as SATAM, except with FUCKING SONGS and [[Milf|Sonic's mom]].

*'''Sonic X''': This show is the one that all of the Sonic [[weeaboo]]s watch. It is the only one that takes the video game canon into account, except it adds a human character named [[Mary Sue|Chris Thorndyke]] (moar like Chris Pron[[Lesbian|dyke]] amirite?), [[True|whom everyone hates]]. Thanks to the presence of Shadow, it is [[over 9000]] times more emo than the above shows. It is also that much more annoying, and the voice acting is some of the worst ever recorded. [[Trolling|SEGA decided to replace the game voice artists with those, causing an on-going war of furfags]]. But Sonic was never cool, as was his voice. In short, this show sucked, brought in a bunch of n00bs to the franchise, and anybody that got into the franchise anytime before it should NOT watch it. It sucks even more than the games.

===The Movies===
[[Image:EggmanFursecution.PNG|thumb|FIGHT THE [[FURRY]] '''MENACE'''!]]
*'''Sonic the Hedgehog OVA''': Sometime [[last Thursday]] it was badly dubbed, and you can easily find this dub on [[JewTube]]. It featured Princess Sara, who has an astonishing resemblance to that [[bestiality]]-obsessed Princess Elise. She also has a monkey tail, thereby further clarifying this series' [[Dragonball Z|source material]]. Tails is also present here, and Sega somehow managed to make his voice ''even gayer''. Sara gets [[bondage|bound and gagged]] in this movie. 

*'''Sonic: Night of the Werehog''': SEGA making a good turn towards advertising Sonic? Ha, ha, no! It's a pretty shitty Sonic Halloween movie that came out a couple years ago about [[furries]], chihuahuas, and [[gay]]. Think of a combination between Sonic X and [[goth|The Nightmare Before Christmas]]. You probably won't like it.
This short film also features casper the friendly ghost's [[fat]] and [[fap]]ping brothers

*'''Eddie Lebron's Sonic the Hedgehog Fan Film''': Eddie Lebron, the same guy who made the [[Megaman]] Fan Film has recently announced a Sonic film for all the [[Furries|fans]] [[Sonmanic|like some other Sonic fan did before it got shit-canned]], oh and he was able to get Jaleel White from the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog to reprise his role, [[No|cause his voice was so charming to listen to right?]]

===Character Evolution===
[[Image:Sonictailsnkkd1111.jpg|thumb|Sonic and Tails, How Sega is very creative when it comes to the males <del>clothing</del> furry's body.]]
At the start of the franchise, aside from the multitude of [[crabs]] and other [[Hentai|tentacle monsters]], which required amazing reflexes to defeat, by holding down right on the D-Pad as well as pressing the A button, there were only two other characters. Sonic the Hedgehog, and Dr. Robotnik. Robotnik is the boss on every level and is defeated by pressing the A button an astounding eight times. 

The usual plot contains [[Dragonball|seven mystical objects that always scatter everywhere, searched for by two similar characters with spiky hair.]]

Scrambling for a new gimmick, Sega decided to bring a new character into the [[Orgy|mix]]. And what type of furry should be best friends with a hedgehog? A fox, of course! Not being able to settle for just a retarded Cat/Fox, he was also "blessed" with a second tail, which somehow gives him the ability to fly. They called their freak of nature, "Tails" — very creative. Sega, being the [[Retards|creative geniuses]] they are, also decided to give their new abomination a squeaky eight year old's voice, enabling them to expand their market from vanilla furries to pedophile furries. 

Not content with a spandex wearing [[fatass]], a blue rodent, and a mutated flying cat, they decided to push the envelope even further. With Sonic's 'tude going unchecked for years, another asshole was needed to step in and show that blue [[faggot]] what's up. Sega decided that Sonic's rival should be the exact same as Sonic, except with slight differences, so their [[furry]] fandom couldn't tell this new, hip character was obviously a recolor. This difference was a pair of brass knuckles underneath the [[Mario|white gloves]] that EVERY FUCKING CHARACTER IN THIS SERIES WEARS. They named this rip-off "Knuckles" — isn't Sega's originality just amazing? These brass "Knux" and his "Don't take shit from nobody, yo" attitude, makes him the token black person of the series.

===Other Characters===

Aside from the aforementioned characters, Sonic features a variety of characters, all equally attractive to furry faggots:

*'''[[PINGAS|Dr Robotnik]] / Eggman''': A fatass in a gay jumpsuit, [[Fat|Eggman]] is to [[Furry|furries]] what [[Hitler]] is to [[Jews]], and his tireless dedication to [[fursecution|fursecuting]] the shit out of Sonic's posse in ''every game'' means he is one of the best villains evar. Unfortunately, he gets pwned by them at the end of every game, contrary to the ideal. Since he's too [[fat]] to do any work himself, he turns captured [[furries]] into [[robot]] [[slavery|slaves]] to do everything for him. ''[[Holocaust|Arbeit macht frei]]'', indeed.

*'''[[Emo|Shadow]]''': [[Failed|SEGA's attempt at making the franchise darker and edgier]] with "[[emo|LOLEDARKPAST]]". Part of this dark past is being plagued by [[Vietnam|flashbacks]] about some underaged girl who he was in love with but he can't touch because she has a disease or some shit. [[lolwut|He also had the heart and soul of this woman]]. His signature ability is the awkward use of firearms, since he is so [[goth|dark and violent]]. Now, would someone PLEASE care to tell me where that 'damn fourth chaos emerald' is?

*'''[[Whore|Rouge]]''': A [[Whore|prostitute bat]] with [[tits]] big enough to make [[your mom]] cry, and the character the [[13-year-old boy]]s and basement dwellers [[fap]] to, assuming they're not [[pedo]]s or [[fag]]s. Sega claims she's 18, but her voice is that of a saggy 40-year old prostitute with green teeth. Fangirls war over whether she belongs with Knuckles or with Shadow [[facepalm|(Even Uncyclopedia takes part in this)]], but who cares? She's definitely sucked and fucked every one of the male characters' cocks, [[transvestite|including her own.]]

*'''[[Fangirl|Amy Rose]]''': Stupid [[jailbait]] bitch who badly wants Sonic to get in her panties. Many [[fantard]]s also engage in [[ship|shipping wars]], regularly developing explosive diarrhea when people don't like their "OTP". She is also the subject of much Sonic-related [[Rule 34]] and has [[pantyshot]]s in every game, despite being 12 years old, tho that equals to 24 years old in hedgehog years. Yet, throughout the series, you can see Sonic and Amy have a moment together. This is because Sonic has had many one night stands of passion with Amy and still does till this day. She may be pregnant with Sonic's child.

*'''[[Lolicon|Cream]]''': Everyone loves Cream (except for [http://www.sonic-cult.org/ these] fags) and most jack off to images of her every night. Somebody should have told SEGA that naming her [[cum|Cream]] was a very, very bad idea considering [[pedophiles|the series' fanbase]].

*'''[[Awesome|Big]]''': An obese, [[asspie]] [[cat]]. His hobbies include fishing and talking like Forrest Gump, except even moar retarded. He is [[BFF]] with a frog who does absolutely nothing. [[Trolling|SEGA obviously created him and his gameplay after the success that was SEGA Bass Fishing]] He is also voiced by [[Duke Nukem]]. [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0820652/ No joke.]

*'''[[13 year old boy|Silver]]''': Whiny [[drama whore]] from the future, and living proof that Sega ran out of ideas years ago. His powers include telekinetic throws that always miss, super slow walking and a voice almost as faggy as Tails'. Silver is commonly seen reciting gay, dramatic lines taken straight out of Lifetime movies. Also, he is covered in pot-leaf symbolism. No, srsly. More proof of his [[awesome]] include his uber manly [[emo|eyeliner]] and his [[gay|sick]] hand [[tattoos]].

*'''[[Zippocat|Blaze]]''': [[mary sue|She is a princess from the future]] that uses [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|pyrokinesis]] and becomes [[an hero]] to save the future, which also causes Silver to become even [[moar]] [[emo]] than Shadow (if that's even fucking possible). Somehow she's wiggled her way into a few spinoff sport events, such as hoverboarding and the Summer and Winter Olympics.

*'''[[Tails Doll]]''': [[Zalgo|c̦͎a̠̜̣n̳͇͓̠̬̯͖ ̮̼͔y̖o͎̮̹̬ṳ͕̗̞͚ ̣̘̗̯̜f̭̬̩e͕e͇͈͎̯̲͓̥l͕͈̤̗̫̺̮ ̠̮̞̰̞̜͔͔t͍h̹̺͓͔e̙͈̼̯͚ͅ ̤̺̩s̬̖̩͍͉̤̘̘ụ͍̞n̘̬̰̥s͍͍̫̻̳̝̝͓h̰̳͔͍̗͔̼̰i̤̱̭̬̗͕͙̻n̥̣͔͙e̱̜̜̲̬̘?͙͓̥͍̯̣ ̤d͕͉͇̬̰o̠̺e͖̮̯͇̺̫̭̻̬s̠̖ ̰̱̹̖͙͙̞̺i̹̯̗̲t̞̬ ̺̺̭͎̦̟̲̤b͖̰̖̭r̗͈̲͈̜̲̼ͅi͇̹̹̳͓̝g̺̦̦h̺̜͖̭̹̤̻t̬̞͙̖̣̻̰̘e̜̞͉̘ͅn̝̭̪͇̣̩̲̳ ̤̯̲̣̤̬̩̪u̪̠̺̣̬p̻̝̦ͅ ̹̰̟͚͍͔̩y̲̭̫o̳̼̮̗͉u̪̜̬̳̞r̯̘̟̺̠̮̯ ͚̩̙d͍͚̥͕̱͓a̦͖̯y̼̥̼̩̝̟̜?̱̠]]

*'''[[Orgy|Team Chaotix]]''': A trio of [[retarded]] detectives. Their leader, [[Find the Computer Room|Vector]], is a [[wigger]] crocodile who currently has a voice like Cookie Monster undergoing a rectal exam. Their "stealth expert", [[naruto|Espio]], is a [[weeaboo]] chameleon with shitty [[ninja]] skills; and [[babyfuck|Charmy]], a [[Wapanese|SUPER KAWAII]] bee who serves as mascot. There was also [[Shit nobody cares about|Mighty, Ray, Heavy & Bomb]], but they don't appear for some reason.

*'''[[NeoPets|Chao]]''': Cute and cuddly creatures that never appear anymore, thus leading to the suicides of several furries.

*'''[[Bestiality|Princess Elise]]''': Some whore from the uncanny valley that Sonic screwed around with in the PS3/360 game, and is an open furry. The blatant cross-species grab-ass that takes place between her and Sonic is an obvious plot to turn children into furries and may be the worst yet of Sega's many crimes against humanity. The kiss between her and sonic has to be the biggest piss take in a video game ever.

*'''[[Australia|Marine]]''': [[Lolicon|Loli]] newcomer that already has [[at least 100]] hentai pictures of her on the interwebs.  She talks in such a thick Australian accent that even [[Steve Irwin]] would tell her to [[stfu|shut the fuck up]]...if he wasn't dead. Seriously, what self-respecting Australian person uses the word "Strewth" anymore?

*'''[[Satan|Mephiles the Dark]]''': A [[recoloring|recolor]] of Shadow that spent too much time stuck in the freezer. He successfully kills Sonic with his [[laser]] but has that undone when Sega goes back in time and pretends the game never existed.

*'''[[You're a bird|The Babylon Rogues]]''': None of them should ever be dignified with their own individual section here. All of them are blatant ripoffs of the kids from ''[[Time for a dicking|Rocket Power]]'' except that they're birds, and [[To_the_max|THEY TOTALLY GOT BEEFED UP THE GRIND, DUDE]], which is extreme slang for being raped and killed by Sonic. Their only note-worthy appearance was in some faggot's hentai comic, where the group's bitch gets fucked by the boss.

*'''[[Tentacle rape|Chaos]]''': An amoeba with a brain of greater capacity than most denizens of [[LiveJournal]] who goes [[DBZ|SUPER SAIYA-JIN]] assuming he eats all the Chaos Emeralds. It's a sure bet that if it's Sonic tentacle porn, this thing is involved. 

*'''[[Mexico|Tikal]]''': An echidna who became [[an hero]] in order to keep Chaos from ruining shit. Lots of Sonic fags like to 'ship' her with Knuckles. Too bad she's dead, dumbfucks. (And that she's basically his distant cousin, considering they came from the same fucking tribe.)

*'''[[AIDS|Maria Robotnik]]''': Eggman's surprisingly [[loli|sweet]] cousin. Shadow has a [[fetish]] for her, but he can't [[sex|touch]] her, because she has [[AIDS|NIDS]] (what a dumb fucking disease name). Shot by G.U.N. Agents in a GTA style shootout. Her death made gamers wonder why SEGA would go to such extremes to include such a horrible death in a game. Shadow didn't take this lightly though, and suddenly has this huge stalker fetish for her, which explains why he [[lulz|screams out her name every fifty seconds.]]

*'''[[Lol wut|Eggman Nega]]''': Moar liek Eggman Nigga, [[amirite]]? Yes, a darker Eggman from another dimension. Seems like even the non-furry characters aren't safe from having retarded recolors made of them. Oh yeah, he's also [[batshit insane]].

*'''[[Lopunny|Vanilla]]''': Cream's mom, who is raising her daughter by herself because the father didn't want to pay for child support and left. While Rouge's voice actor on ''Sonic X'' makes her sound like a 50-year-old-whore, Vanilla's makes her sound like she's [[at least 100]] years old and on various illegal substances.

*'''[[Mary Sue|Chris Thorndyke]]''': Some gay Jew kid from ''Sonic X'' who nobody likes. He is introduced in the pilot episode right after he saves Sonic from drowning in some pool. Right then, he makes a vow to have [[buttsex]] with Sonic. It is never revealed that they indeed have buttsex. However, there is a six-month gap between the end of the 1st season and the 2nd season, so it's [[rape|anybody's guess what happened]]. An effective method of trolling the Sonic X fanbase is to claim that you actually LIKE Chris and state reasons why. 

*'''[[Gardevoir|Cosmo]]''': A character from the cartoon "''[[Nickelodeon|Fairly Oddparents]]''" who makes a cameo appearance in the third season of ''Sonic X'' as [[What|a female plant]]. [[He|She]] and Tails have a [[gay|relationship]] until Tails kills [[Fag|her]] to save the universe, much like Aeris in ''Final Fantasy VII'', except with a big fucking [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|laser beam]]. [[Man|Her]] death was prime material for shitty AMVs and constituted the single most wangsty scene in Sonic history. Shadow also died so that's one good thing going for ''Sonic X'', but knowing them they'll just bring him back sometime in the middle of the next season so they can do a plot based off of Shadow the Hedgehog.

* '''[[Gary_Oak|Dark Oak]]''': Main villain of ''Sonic X'' and shameless ripoff of Freiza from [[DBZ|some other shitty animu]]. He comes to Sonic's planet and starts up a plot that shamelessly rips off the sequel to that other show, which by rights makes it as bad as the first season.  

*'''[[Shit nobody cares about|Nazo]]''': A recolor of Super Sonic that briefly appeared in the ''Sonic X'' pilot. [[13-year-old boy|13 year old Sonic fans]] and [[User:HedgeJew|HedgeJew]] went batshit insane over him and turned him into a villain, making him more of a product of [[furries|the fandom]] than Sega or 4Kids.

*'''[['Missing White Woman' Syndrome|Sally Acorn]]''': Original knockoff character who appeared in the comics and 90's television show, Sally is a [[princess]]. She never made it to the games though, as Amy Rose, Rouge The Bat, Knuckles The Echidna, and Bunnie The Rabbit [[murder|fucked her up using a hammer, a pair of spiky fists, foot claws, and a robotic arm.]] [[abortion|She lost her baby too, which she was carrying inside of her furry body.]] She appears in the comics though, having survived, and now seeks vengeance against her killers, thus making her the [[furry]] version of Uma Thurman. Is mostly known for her short-lived relationship with Sonic and her obsession with him forever after. Constantly bawws about the fact that he prefers saving everyone's lives to being her bitch.

*'''[[Boobs|Bunnie Rabbot]]''': Bunnie Rabbit, like Sally Acorn also appeared in the comics and TV show. Known for her [[robot|robotic arms]] and [[boobs|furry breast implants]], Bunnie used her [[Redneck|Southern charm]] and with to flirt with everybody around her. That is...until Rouge came along. You can troll Bunnie fans by reminding them that [[awesome|she married Antoine in canon]].

*'''[[Mario|Mushroom Kingdom Characters]]''': These [[drunk|barhopping]] retards crossed paths with our furry crew to compete in Olympic Events, without the aid of [[Michael Phelps]]. Their group consists of four [[racist|stereotypical]] Italian plumbers, two princesses, a dinosaur, a monkey, an evil koopa and his son, and a midget couple with mushrooms for heads.

There are also a host of other characters who are never used anymore. We wouldn't want to have to [[Michael Jackson|expose]] you to them, but seeing as how this is an informational article, [[bullshit|we have to.]] You see, SEGA has a history of using their characters once or twice and then throwing them in the trash, where they belong. [[Retro]]fags ''hate'' them for this.  Among these trashed characters include a Jew with guns, a [[fatass]] polar bear, robot versions of Knuckles and Tails, a rodent prick named Antoine, a walrus, oh, and Sonic's long lost [[retard|musically inclined]] siblings, among others. There was also the return of the previously mentioned armadillo but since SEGA didn't pick him, he sucks. Fantards constantly call for their return. Thankfully, it'll never happen.

==[[Shit nobody cares about|Actor portrayal]]==
While most people would think whoever voiced who wasn't anything worth giving two fucks about, some people actually do. Sonic's first voice in the older animated TV shows was done by black person, a retrofag favorite. In the animated movie, he went from nigger to British with Martin Burke taking over. His first voice actor for the video games was Ryan Drummond, the man who made fame by saying some of the most campiest lines in video game history. Admittedly, it did match with the faggot character. Surprisingly, people actually liked this jackass, and went apeshit when he was replaced by Jason Griffith, the voice for Sonic in Sonic X. More recently, though, it's been confirmed that Sonic will be voiced by Roger Craig Smith aka Chris Boulder Punching Redfield, which SEGA actually saw as [[wtf|franchise changing]] news. There's also that Junichi Kanemaru guy, but nobody cares about him.

==The Fanbase==
[[Image:Rapper.jpg|thumb|Your average Sonic fan, giant gap in between teeth and... red eyes?]]
[[Image:Jrod_sonic_failure.jpg|thumb|150px||Im sure his parents are very proud.]]
The Sonic fanbase is, unsurprisingly, filled with furfaggotry.  The fandom is also filled with [[drama]], the essential staple for any furry fandom, usually between "new" and "old" Sonic fans. It is split into four distinctive parts:

# [[Sonic CulT|Furry smuts from the "old" part of the fandom are those who do nothing but bitch about how much recent Sonic games suck]]. Nobody, not even SEGA, gives two fucks about them.
# The typical kind of fan. They just buy the games and play them. ''And actually enjoy them.'' [[Jenkem|How they do it]] is anybody's guess.
# The general faggots that watched Sonic X and probably [[Newfag|don't know what a Sega Genesis is]]. This section of the fandom delights in creating fan-characters, which are arguably the most plentiful but least imaginative fan characters in any fandom ever. It is an unwritten, but strictly enforced law that [[time paradox|all fan-characters can go super without using the Chaos Emeralds]]. Most of them are [[Recolor]]ed Sonic or Shadow clones wearing [[Columbine|trenchcoats]], those stupid [[goth]] boots, equipped with swords (which in most cases are [[weeaboo|katana]]s, are able to go [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|Super]] at any time, and are most likely evil. This part also produces the worst of the Sonic porn due to it being drawn by [[Virgin|people who either don't know what a vagina actually looks like]], or have just copied it from a porno mag they found in <strike>some bushes</strike> their dad's drawer.
# [[Christian Weston Chandler]].

Some Sonic fans manage, by some miracle unexplained by [[science]], to muster up enough strength to leave their basements and go out into the [[IRL]] world long enough to purchase an actual hedgehog, which does not possess super speed or abnormally high power levels. They then proceed to take the creature home, name it after one of the hedgehog characters, [[beastiality|and sexually abuse it]].

{{squote|Sonic the Hedgehog ran very quickly down the hall to where the fire was coming from. While running he ducked into a rolling spin and made a sound like "[[@|@@@@@@@]]!" so he could dodge the fireball lasers.

At the top of the staircase he stood up and shouted at the top of the staircase "[[Sephiroth]]!" The man with long hair turned slowly and with a flash of his sword removed Sonic's [[Mantits|nipples]] from his body.

"OUCH that hurts1" cried Sonic, hurting. "Looks like I will need the power of the CHAOS CRYSTAL for this opponent!" and he raised up a handful of glowing gems.

The light from the jewels summoned all the legendary [[pokemon]] in the world together and they fused together into a Pyschic Ghost Dragon Pokemon. "LEAVE THIS TO ME, SONIC THE HEDGEHOG!" it said in the voice a thousand monsters, and shot a giant [[Hadouken]] at Sephiroth.

Sephiroth bounced it back with a spin of his blade, and it hit the Psy-Gho-Dra-Mon in the face, crashing him to the floor and half-crushing No-Nipples Sonic. "This is bad!" said Half-Dead No-Nipples the Hedgehog. "It looks like we will need to call for that man, Psyghodramon!"

"YES" he agreed, and used his 7 physic goat dragon balls to make a wish "SEND US THE CHOSEN HERO OF PROPHECY!" as Sephiroth slowly descended to finish them off.

Just then a bright light from the sky shone, and the Grand Master [[Mary Sue|John Su]] descended from the moon on rocket powered rocket boots, with a beautiful woman on each arm. When he landed, there was a chorus and fanfare of trumpets, and he lowered his sunglasses and said "Yo."

"Who are you" said Sephiroth as he threw a [[ninja]] star at light speed at John Su. John Su turned and winked at the star, and the bright light instantly dissolved it into space dust. "Pretty good," said Sephiroth, "but your still gonna loose!" and he transformed into [[DBZ|Super Saiyan 4]] Sephiroth.

"Take this!" he screamed as he flew towards John Su. John Su flexed a single muscle, generating an awesome MANWAVE that overpowered Super Sephiroth and sent him flying into space, frozen forever in defeat.

"Thank you for saving us, John Su" said the world. "You are so strong and cool"

"I know," he replied, and jumped back up to the moon after resurrecting the [[Naruto|4th Hokage]].|"[http://johnsu.deviantart.com/art/My-First-Fanfic-155792920 My First Fanfic]"

==Anti-[[Pedophilia]]==
[[Image:Sonic jackson.jpg|thumb|150px|Even [[Michael]] was a furfag.]]
Sonic is well-known for being a strong advocate of protecting minors against [[4chan|sexual predators]]. He can frequently be found around schools, teaching kids that harassment is "no good" and that when confronted by a molester, one should "get outta there" as soon as possible. This is also [[ironic]] since Sonic and [[Michael Jackson]] are actually [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbVM-l2Oku4 BFF] which questions the [[Sick Fuck|true intentions]] of Sonic. In the debate of Sonic actually being a pedophile, many Sonic fans, much like the fans of Micheal Jackson, will [[Waambulance|quickly deny]] him of ever being one and start a petition in closing down websites dedicated to proving he actually is one. Even if Sonic really [[Lies|isn't a pedophile]], at least the similarities he has with Mr. Jackson is that they look even gayer after receiving their plastic surgery, they have the most retarded fanbase and were always "no good".

<video type="youtube" id="lvB8bIom9jw" width="400" height="300" desc="In the early 90s, Sonic broadcast a public service announcement in which he expressed his love for [[pedophilia]]." frame="true" position="center"/>
