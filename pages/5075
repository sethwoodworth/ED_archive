Once known as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the name of this machine was changed because the word nuclear makes people go batshit paranoid.

[[wat|'''MRI''' is a spectroscopic technique that measures the precession, that is, rotation, of nuclei in a strong magnetic field, when pulsed with radio frequency electromagnetic energy.  Through the use of magnetic field gradients, three-dimensional images can be produced, as well as sectional slices.]]

MRIs are [http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/html/MRI.html big scary machines] shaped like a tube.  You get strapped down, possibly injected with noxious substances and then wheeled into the tube where you spend up to an hour being subjected to horrible loud banging sounds.

Despite their ferocious nature, MRI machines are easily [[pwned]] by [http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/207390_mri11.html idiots].

MRIs have been hunted to all but extinction by [[Al Gore]] and his Mooninauts.

== People Who Wouldn't Fit in an MRI ==
Some people are too [[fat]] to fit in an MRI. Radiologists use the euphemism <del>[http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/news/news_to_use/10660588.htm?1c LBBH]</del>[[BALEETED]] which means "limited by body habitus", to refer to fatty-fats like the following grotesque caricatures of the human form:

* [[Iworshipsatin]] - The one who started it all.
* [[Futhman]]
* [[this is warmth]]
* [[butterymufkin]]
* [[Jameth]]
* [[Aussieintn]]
* [[Schol-R-LEA]] (Who certainly is lubed up most of the time, but still couldn't fit)
* [[Donut Girl]] - The Donut Girl
* [[Shay]] - Who was so [[fat|unable to fit]] that she died of [[diabeetus]].
* [[Fyrerii]]
* [[Donna Simpson]]
* [[Rosie O'Donnell]]
* [[You]]
* [[Your Mom]]
* [[WisCon|Everybody at WisCon]]
* [[Insane Clown Posse|Violent J]]
