[[Internet Humanitarianism]] is a severe form of [[internet disease]] which existed throughout the world for centuries, but started to accelerate during the coming of the [[web 2.0]].  Internet Humanitarians are frequently referred to as Internet Paladins.

== Symptoms of Humanitarianism ==
* Claiming to act purely to help others, despite being purely for their own benefit.
* Selfless, until they realize no one around is regretful
* Value vigilantism, until they're the ones being vigilante
* Value freedom of speech, until their privacy is broken
* Value open source, until their system breaks
* Value socialism, until they are broke from paying for black persons' health care.
* Value morality, until the world finds out about their own mistakes.
* Value the opinion of others, unless it's critique, then you are [[hater]].
* Believe in the power of the people, until they realize they can't dictate what happens, [[X is not your personal army]].
