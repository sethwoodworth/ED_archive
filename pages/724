Born Alisa Zinovievna Rosenbaum in [[Soviet Russia]], '''Ayn Rand''' was from a wealthy bourgeois family until the Commies came and took it all away.  So rebelled against the system like any [[angsty teen]], named herself after a typewriter, and wrote a lot of [[poetry|crappy literature]] that caught on with [[college]] [[student]]s, [[16 year old girl]]s, and other selfish, egotistical [[gaylord]]s and sociopaths. Her sci-fi religion, [[Randroid|Objectivism]], never caught on like [[fire|wildfire]] among those who had piles of [[money]] and wanted to keep those piles and create newer, bigger piles while they were at it; but it was a success among [[furries|poor anti-hippie atheist intellectuals of the 60s]]. On the other hand, her philosophy of "all women have fantasies about being raped", as laid out in "The Fountainhead" caught on like wildfire with the masses.  

Objectivism (Rand's <s>religion</s> cult) launched a [[Jihad]] against rational thought and any sense of charity (even absent of the weak logic for taxation) at least a millennium ago. Therefore ED lies as high in their priorities as their acolytes typical state of mind (see graphic to the right). Yet in spite of this, Rand and her minions are largely [[truth|humorless dickless wonders]].

==Objectivism==
[[Image:Ayn_Rand_virgen_a40.jpg|right|thumb|Ayn's self-made biopic about her life. In truth, Ayn was a monstrously vindictive [[whore]], and an unrestrained [[slut]].]]

'''A less successful version of ''[[Scientology|Dianetics]]'', it consists of a "technology" to make socially backward basement dwellers into self-righteous zealots.''' 

Objectivism came from Ayn's utter hatred of [[communism]] with every [[centipede filled vagina|centipede in her vagina]]. She knew that when you give people a chance to be fair in all things, they would wait until you weren't looking and [[Brooklyn|steal everything that wasn't nailed down and on fire]] ([[Retards|On-line communists]] will argue that capitalism causes this greed, because [[Basement-dweller|they have no experience of owning anything anyone else wants]]). That's why we have the godly government which is composed of people with a higher nature than us and who shit ice cream and piss champagne.

In her own words:
:My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.

{{quote|Kill by laughter. Laughter is an instrument of human joy. Learn to use it as a weapon of destruction. Turn it into a sneer. It’s simple. Tell them to laugh at everything.

Kill reverence and you’ve killed the hero in man.|Ayn Rand| on LOLs}}

TL;DR? She expected all men to be a combination of Indiana Jones and Thomas Edison, fighting looters like gold-crazed [[Nazi]]s and single-handedly inventing practical new alloys [[Gangbang|AT THE SAME TIME]]. Those seeking to become heroes through Objectivism, by contrast, end up as [[fail|failures]] who wish Rush wrote songs about them. Her book "Atlas Shrugged" shows that she's a staunch [[libertarian]] on all issues except labor, because unskilled workers were put on the Earth by a [[God]] she doesn't believe in to be used and abused by the upper class and then discarded. Basically, it's Stalinism with the identities of the "workers" and "parasites" reversed.  Proletarians aren't human, they're scum - making her "philosophy" a less honest version of Nietzsche's. Not to mention that she had a major [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard23.html cult of personality].

As an economic theory, Objectivism can be accurately modeled using [http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=583469 cheese triangles].

Ayn Rand outlined her vision of aesthetics in "The Romantic Manifesto" and "The Art of Fiction Writing" in which she explains how to plagiarize lesser known novels such as [http://mises.org/books/driver.pdf Garet Garrett's "The Driver"] and Yevgeny Zamyatin's "We", and then use them as a vehicle for a crude, batshit insane home-made religion for turning ordinary people into autistic sociopaths.

In her own words:
:My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as being too retarded for real philosophy but not retarded enough for Scientology.

==The Fountainhead==

Rand's first book was ''The Fountainhead'', a novel that was part rape-fantasy romance novel, part glorified masturbationfest towards people who draw Italian postcards, and part condemnation of the dumbing-down of the American people. The story involves a down-and-out architect turned rapist and arsonist that no one will hire because he doesn't build according to the tastes of the dumb ignorant mob. He rapes a rich girl who was [[asking for it]].  She then becomes obsessed with him but shows her commitment by marrying everyone BUT her obsession because she thinks that, if they stay apart and remain miserable, they will be superior to the chattel of humanity that surrounds them.  If you're forced to read a single Ayn Rand novel, make it this one, as it's shorter (by Rand standards) and the characters have a smattering of personality.

The plot can be broken down like this:
*Random shit happens in the beginning to tell us how awesome Howard Roark is, and how feeble and selfish Peter Keating is.
*More random shit happens to tell us how awesome Howard Roark is and how selfish Ellsworth Toohey is
*More random shit happens to tell us how awesome Howard Roark is and how selfish everyone is
*Finally, some random shit happens to tell us how awesome Howard Roark is and how much more awesome he really is
*Climax: Howard Roark is a hero and very very awesome. Ayn Rand would eat his poop any day.

It was made into a movie in 1948, infamous as far as Rand throwing a tantrum to force the screen-writers to keep her long, incoherent speech at the end when the architect-rapist-arsonist speaks to a jury and successfully gets acquitted by playing the [[IDIFTL|"I blew up a building because I had the right to do so as an individual" card.]]

Face it. Howard could never, ever, EVER have survived in the real capitalist world.

''The Fountainhead'' was remade in 2000 into the brilliant film, ''American Psycho.''

==[[TL;DR|Atlas Shrugged]]==

The poster child for TL;DR, ''Atlas Shrugged'' is considered the gateway book for Rand's cult of Objectivism. The Israelies in charge of her estate are collecting money and pushing more amounts of indoctrinating TL;DR into schools. Better than the Catcher in the Rye, though: it weights more.

''Atlas Shrugged'' is a 10,000,000-page [[shit|brick]] of a book whose supposed climax is a 60-page speech by the main character, who doesn't actually show up until page 600. In it, Rand outlines her utopia: men are men, women are subservient, maniacal bitches, and everybody who has ever disagreed with her, faltered in their agreement with her, or just not agreed hard enough dies a horrible, slow death after the fall of civilization.

Back in the 1970s, Albert S. Ruddy, the producer of "The Godfather," first approached Ayn Rand to make a movie of her novel "Atlas Shrugged." But Rand, who had fled the Soviet Union and gone on to inspire capitalists and egoists everywhere, worried aloud, apparently in all seriousness, that the Soviets might try to take over Paramount to block the project.

The plot goes something like this: America is ruled by generic 50's [[socialism|socialist]] overlords who have everyone turned into lazy drunken Russians and broke everything until John Galt, a robot from the future, comes back in time to save computers and major airlines from not being created. At the same time a nymphomaniac has a crush on the android, and then they have robot sex in the subway. It takes 1,200 pages to sum it up.   Thankfully, internets has done this for us.

{{quote|Essentially, Atlas Shrugged was a Railroad Tycoon fanfic with Dagny as Rand's mary-sue.|some c/lit/}}

The opening words of this book are "Who is John Galt?" ParkingStones crossed out the words "Who is John Galt?" and replaced them with "Dude, Where's My Car?" The meaning stayed pretty much the same.

It's more useful as a doorstop than actual reading material.

==[[Liberalism|Anthem]]==

In contrast, her [[shortcat|novella]] by the name of ''[[Hippies|Anthem]]'' is written on three toilet papers. Ayn once used them to clean her period blood off of her cat's mouth. She was so inspired by her kitty's [[Jewish|explosive]] tongue action that she immediately wrote every word that came to her [[vagina | brain]]. The result was ''Anthem''.

This is great to read while fucking a cheap whore, since both are [[Gaia|really men in disguise]].

==Vindictive Whore==
Ayn Rand married struggling actor Frank O' Connor in 1929; as Ayn was a power-mad feminist writer, Frank quickly assumed the role of bitch to his domineering wife. When Ayn met the young (and married) Objectivist and fantard Nathaniel Branden, the two began fucking each other, ultimately telling their spouses that they needed to STFU about Ayn and Nathan's adultery and live with it. 

During this time, Nathaniel Branden became a leading figure in spearheading the Objectivist movement. But this all came to an end, when Nathaniel was caught fucking a third woman, a young actress, behind Ayn Rand's back. Ayn disowned her boytoy and had him become a pariah within the Objectivist movement for daring to cheat on Ayn. Of course, Ayn herself was cheating on Branden, with Alan "[[I accidentally X|I accidentally the dollar]]" Greenspan, who remarked "I have fucked many women over the years, but never have I fucked a woman like Rand, whose vagina was crawling with centipedes!"

==And the Jew will inherit the Earth==
Objectivists imagine a rational world where everybody would mind their own rational self-interest and people wouldn't troll each other but work individually to achieve unparalleled wealth. This means creating more A.I., who would naturally decide that people are not as rational as robots and should therefore be exterminated for having seized the undeserved like the socialist leeches we are. Since the pursuit of wealth by robots is their highest principle <b>only after Israel's right to exist, it can be concluded that the [[Jews]] will be the only "humans" to inherit the Earth</b>.

==What to do with her "novels"==
Beat up children with them, because nobody has phone books anymore. It doesn't have to be your children, any children will do nicely.

"Nazi" you say? Try reading it and then tell us it's not justified.

==Trolling with Rand==

More recently, at least one doinitright use for Rand's works has been discovered: as an instant troll-button for the otherwise troll-resistant hive of [[neckbeards|astute]] [[fag|literary]] [[douchebag|critics]] known as /lit/.

Step 1: Head over to Amazon and snag a picture of the cover of any 'novel' by Rand.  This will be useful for step 2.
     Note: though Atlas Shrugged is the optimal choice, The Fountainhead will also do.

Step 2: Head on over to /lit/.  Post the image -- you may remember this from step 1! -- with a sincere-sounding paragraph to the effect that you've just finished the book, agree with everything in it, and would like to discuss it with other [[Pretty Cool Guy]]s.  For increased troll power, note that you are a high-school student and do not read much literature.  

Step 3: As genuine fans of the novel are drawn to the thread, a southerly trollfront rolls in.  This collides with the lingering mass of oldfags to create a perfect trollstorm.

Step 4: Seek shelter until the trollstorm has passed!  Alternately, venture into the eye of the trollstorm to post a follow-up-troll to the effect that you hated Catcher in the Rye, Slaughterhouse Five, or anything by Nabokov.  

     Note: this requires you to pass a persuasion check, or be detected and forced to begin the troll again.

Step 5/6/: ???, profit, etc

==Virtual Objectivsm==
The Objectivist Institute has a presence on ''[[Second Life]]'', where it is located at Marco Island 87, 34, 23 ("Your Galt's Gulch away from home"). The sheer immensity of the [[faggotry]] and pseudointellectual [[circle-jerk|circle-jerking]] that goes on there is suspected to defy most traditional methods whereby such faggotry is quantified.

*[[Left_4_Dead|Francis]] hates Rand. Thus making him a [[pretty cool guy]].
