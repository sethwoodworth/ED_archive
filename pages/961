'''Bill Hicks''' was a [[chubby|chubby]], [[Uncyclopedia|unfunny]] comedian/[[douchebag]] from around [[at least 100 years ago|100 years ago]] who is notable for dying of [[Cancer]] before he could hit the big time and sell out like a [[dane cook|bitch]]. Of course Hollywood didn't care, since in his short time on Earth, Hicks spawned a wave of [[fucktards|underage fanboys]]. Hicks was noted for his love of corporate America, and often took money from [[republicans|Right Wing]] groups to fund his tours.  He Hated drug users and correctly thought of psychedelic culture as being backwards thinking hippy bullshit, which is funny since a lot of fried out hippys who are [[New Age|fans]] of the crappy whine-rock band tool profess to love Bill Hicks. 

Hicks's gimmick, before dying of [[Cancer]],  was that he talked about how dumb rednecks were, complaining about how Iraq War I was nothing more than George Bush Senior showing to the world how big his penis was, his hatred for Republicans (being one of the first comedians to introduce the concept of [[Lemonparty]] to the masses, via a bit involving [[Ronald Reagan]], [[W|George H.W. Bush]], [[Dan Quayle]] and [[Rush Limbaugh]] having shit/piss themed sex parties), and celebrity bashing (envisioning Jay Leno committing [[suicide]] by sticking an Uzi in his mouth [[Billo the Clown|live on TV]], calling George Michaels gay, Debbie Gibson and Tiffany 69ing each other), and [[butthurt|whining]] about how celebrities who do commercials deserve to be shot in the back of the skull. But his most famous bit was his mocking of non-smokers, not knowing that fate was gearing up to kick him in the ass by giving him pancreatic cancer (though lung cancer would have been funnier and much more ironic). 
   
{{quote|The world is like [[dick neck|a ride]] in an [[goatse|amusement park]]. And when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very loud and it's fun -- for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question. "Is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, they say, "Hey, don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride." And we... we kill those people.|Bill Hicks}}

==Cancerboy Himself==
[[Image:Bill Hicks Grave.jpg|thumb|right|Bill Hicks has been performing gigs at this spot since 1994 and most people think it's an improvement on his older material]]
After dying of [[Cancer]], his gimmick became him having his asshole eaten by maggots as his brains liquified and poured out of his decaying skull. Critics often hail this as far superior [[lulz]] than the material he used on stage.  
While he was alive, [[nobody]] gave a fuck about him, as people instead jacked off to Andrew Dice Clay instead. Clay used the same dirty language as Hicks but talked mainly about fucking women instead; ironically Clay never caught AIDS from his talk about sex, proving that smoking is more dangerous than bareback fucking 1000 whores. As such, as soon as Hicks died(of cancer), his five or six fans proclaimed that he came into the world [[too soon]] and started tarring and feathering the career of Denis Leary, the only Hicks copycat who went on to have anything remotely resembling a career. Leary, who does not have [[Cancer]] like Bill Hicks did (yet), knows that he is a huge fraud of epic proportions, and try's to make up for his lack of creativity by engaging in a vast amount of charity work, while shitting on Hicks' grave to bait the Hicks fanboys by being a douche towards their idol, who died of [[Cancer]].

Because Hicks (who died of cancer) was too drunk to complete an average 15 minute set, he was forced to slum in [[England]], where drunkenly slurring and yelling at the audience for booing is considered the height of comedy. Only David Letterman, who seems to be [[Cancer]] -free, would give him airtime, as if further evidence of Letterman's faggotry were needed. Hicks was also one of the first known [http://www.triplestarnews.com/images/the_memo/bonedog/cancerrat/cancerrat.html cancer rats]

Although the [[Cancer]] ridden Hicks was too drunk/stoned/tripping balls to get work while he was not dead because of cancer, quite the opposite has occurred since he's been put in the ground. Spurned by an ex-producer anxious to earn a living pimping his [[Cancer]] eaten corpse, Billy the dead [[Cancer]] boy, has now gained quite a cult following and is idolized by millions of junior college fags on the [[internet]] who have a disturbing [[necrophilia|necrophiliac]] lust for Hicks' decaying, [[Cancer]] filled, cock.  This legion of gullible shitheads will take every opportunity to misquote Hicks and get into pointless arguments proclaiming Hicks as the ZOMG BEST COMMEDIEN [[EVAR]][[oneoneone|!!!!1!!1ONE]].  They seem to think that their [[fanboy]]ism for Hicks somehow makes them edgy, smart, and discerning individuals, but in reality, they're still just [[unfunny]] [[nerd]]s spewing bullshit on the internet and would get bitchslapped by Hicks had he not died of cancer.  Of course, if Bill Hicks was alive today, he would have inevitably would have sold out to the man and have his own sitcom on CBS, where he would be playing Neil Patrick Harris's womanizing, cigar-smoking, a-hole father on "How I Met [[your_mom|Your Mother]]" for [[jew_gold|big bucks]].

==Goat Boy== 
One of Hicks' alter egos was a [[furfag]] goat by the name of Goat Boy who would go around looking for [[sex]] with [[loli]]. No, seriously, guys, look.

Unfortunately, this schtick was copied by [[pothead]] comedian Jim Breuer on [[SNL]] [[at least 100|more than a decade ago]]:

=='''Denis Leary, aka Nutra-Hicks'''==
[[Image:Denis Leary.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Denis Leary: Bill Hicks minus the funny, and minus the [[Cancer]].]]
[[Image:Louierape.jpg|thumb|Louie CK's message to Leary]]
[[Cancer]]free, Irish sodomite, Denis Leary, stole a lot of Bill's jokes. Later, on his 9-11 masturbation-centric show "Rescue Me", did a storyline where his character, after systematically stalking his estranged wife and terrorizing her because she dared try and divorce him, raped her and made her fall back in love with him by way of fucking her against her will. 

Leary, who failed to be as good as Hicks at getting [[Cancer]] and dying, has even gone so far as to try to [[troll IRL]] Bill Hicks's tumor ridden corpse with a routine called "No Cure for [[Cancer]]". However, the act fell flat because Leary did not finish the routine by blowing his head off with a shotgun at the end, something that critics to this day believe would have made the routine actually entertaining. 

{{quote|I have a scoop for you. I stole his [Leary's] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did|Bill Hicks}}

===A real "[[asshole]]"===

[[Last Thursday]] on the [[Opie and Anthony]] radio show, it was revealed that the song "I'm An Asshole", which defined Leary's career, wasn't even his own; the idea was originally thought up by [[Louis CK]]. Leary decided to take a page out of the [[Dane Cook]] playbook, [[steal]]ing one of Louie's bits and passing it off as his own.

Two months later, after being exposed as a hack, he went on the same show and [[NO U|tried to discredit]] Louie's story with a much weaker one, making Leary into a massive [[fucktard]] once again.

==Faggoty Musicians and How They Swing From Hicks's Dead Scrotum==
[[basement dwellers|Devotees of Hicks]] have copypasta'd his life into their shitty music. Soundbytes of [[Cancer]]boys' drug induced rantings, has found its way into many shitty [[Goatse|art pieces]]. His influence on [[Tool]] is well known to fags, furries, and intellectuals.
After seeing how much [[Jew gold|money]] Tool made by sucking on the tumor ridden ass of Bill Hicks, The Britfag group Radiohead dedicated their second and third album to Hicks, who died of [[cancer]].
Other shitty musicians have dedicated albums to him and written songs about him. But no one has ever brought themselves to care about those fags, so why waste your time putting their shitty sounding names on here.
