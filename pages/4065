Internet Freedom Movement
[[File:IFM_logo.png|frameless|center|900px]]

The '''Internet Freedom Movement''' (IFM) is a movement intended to stop the [[ACTA|Anti-Counterfeit Trade Agreement]] from taking effect. They thought it would be the next potential [[shitty|epic]] movement since [[Chanology|Chanology]] but it's pretty much dying thanks to all the drama.

==Origin==
[[Last Thursday|The IFM was started when Cthulhu rose from the depths of Sarah Palin's filthy vagina in an attempt to thwart said faggotry. First recruiting Van Helsing, Cthulhu then immediately demanded /b/lackup, and the war upon faggotry commenced in earnest. As of current, the movement consists of two websites, a forum, and an IRC channel.]]

==Drama==

A lot of drama has occurred in IFM's old [[IRC]] but was fixed when the entire operation moved to a server with more whiney, [[butthurt]] admins, like Seisatsu (pictured). Seisatsu, as his name implies, is a whiny [[weeaboo]] who has no business running an IRC server. 

The excess drama has caused the project to end, and those that got out of it early are enjoying many [[lulz]] watching the few remaining members cling to what's left, which is nothing.

==Achievements==
The IFM has two websites, and an IRC channel which averages about > 60 users at any time, usually consisting of everyone talking at the same time and unable to [[STOP POSTING|shut the fuck up]].
This makes the mods on the IRC butthurt and ban random people.
