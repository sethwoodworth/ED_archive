Fuanon
A [[Greatestjournal]] user account created for the sole purpose of commenting anonymously and being a general faggot all around. It is the most recent and long lasting incarnation; replacing anonlolz, funanon, and anon_questions.

The community went on standby on Monday July 1st, as the [[fags|mods]] had to [[Starcraft|construct additional pylons]].

The community is now back as of Wednesday July 3rd, with two new mods, mat and robin, along with riffmaster leaving. Strict rules have been put into place that many [[Anonymous]] are questioning, most claiming the new rules a form of censorship on the internet.

The community is now dead as GreatestJournal is no more.  A spinoff community, [[anonquestions|anonquestions]], now afflicts [[livejournal|livejournal]].

== Creation and Mods ==
The account was originally created by [[mod|Toast]], who quickly added Riffmaster as co-[[fag|mod]] with the power of favoritism. Riffmaster, craving the need to show off her new moderator powers, added two more [[fags|mods]]: Lysergicacid and Outrage. It has been said by [[Anonymous]] that he was the best [[fag|mod]] EVAR that any had witnessed in such communities. They were all dead fucking wrong. After roughly one month in his position, he was removed without so much as being told because the mods are bitches. He still frequents the community, but isn't quite as active as he used to be.  Outrage has since left of her own accord, after being proven a sneaky bitch. She has been replaced by token faggot syringe.

On July 3rd Riffmaster took her leave as [[fag|worst mod ever]]. She has been replaced by hurrah and bocce.

As of December 2007, the mods were [[mod|toast]], [[mod|letsddr]] and two unknown non-anons.

== Notable History and Characters ==

There have been a few moments during the lifetime of fuanon that are worth remembering, though no one really does.

Originally, every post made by the community was simply some text, either rules and regulations or just the [[fags|mods]] bitching. Lysergicacid was the first to post a picture instead, and it has become natural ever since. It is agreed many people enjoyed Lysergicacid's pictures the most; since his [[fag|mod]] status has been removed many have agreed the quality of [[lulz]] per post have decreased dramatically.

There have been countless disputes over the [[fags|mods]] of the community, most claiming them to be god-modding after banning [[furries|fags]].

At one point, a revolt started by [[Anonymous]] caused a new community to be brought into creation: anon[[sauce]]. Many [[Anonymous]] migrated to this new community, not knowing it was owned by the exact same [[fags|mods]] as [[fuanon]]. Late that night Lysergicacid returned and declared "[[:Image:Faggottree.jpg|WHAT FAGGOTRY IS THIS!?]]" Not content with letting the longest lasting anonymous community die out, he resurrected [[fuanon]].

Soon after all previous mods had returned, Lysergicacid was relieved of his duties.  A sad day indeed.

One other event occurred that chased [[fag|introseduce]] out during the summer. One anon googled his name and posted an article in relation to his brother's deal due to driving under the influence of cocaine. This article was posted and reposted, which caused the journal to shut down. Outcries of favoritism were heard all around, but the community was brought back a few days later. This kept happening until people stopped caring.

== Post Entries ==

After the GJ community anon_questions saw the posting of [[elite|emcee]]'s friends locked entry, there was an explosion of entry posting that still hasn't subsided. Entries are now deleted and marked as spam, so they went to blurty and created a new journal for posting entries. 

[[elite|Dulsey]] figured out that [[psycho|Jackson]] was one of the many people posting entries, but [[fuanon|fuanon]] didn't really care. Over time, almost all people were accused of posting entries, until it was eventually out that former [[fag|mod]] outrage was responsible for posting the entries of many of her friends.

== Typical Events in a Day ==

As [[fuanon]] came to be from divierto, it makes sense that a lot of the comments are in the same vein. We see the following things multiple times a day:

* Lists of popular users followed by: YOUR HONEST OPINION, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF?
* A link to a post in Divierto and: HOTTIES/NOTTIES?
* Request for a list of fatties
* WHERE ARE THE FLAMES?
* Post more porn!
* Who do you hate on GJ?

== Fakes, Ghosts, Canoodles, and Spuds - THE SUPERANONS ==

There have been a few waves of trends that have lived in [[fuanon]] (and other communities) history. The ghosts were one of the first, with the original being scaryghost. A few other [[Anonymous]] saw the idea as cute and followed suit, making such usernames as uglyghost, beautifulghost, catghost, buseyghost, and jewghost. Scaryghost was the only one who lasted the longest and it should be noted, is "played" by user sair.

The canoodles rose to power not long after, but the idea was written off as retarded by most users. 5 canoodles came into existence, and every time one of them posted a comment, were attacked mercilessly by [[Anonymous]] who does not take kindly to shitty ideas and forced memes.

The spuds are the most recent, and as far as anyone can tell, are really just two non-Greatestjournal users dicking around. After being banned once for relentless spamming, the two created countless other accounts in an attempt to flood [[fuanon]]. They failed and have since settled down and post at a steady rate like any self-respecting [[Anonymous]].

The beginning of the [[lulz|superanons]] was started by [[nobody|teeny]] and a gang of idiots in the immortal [[fuanon]] chat. The fakes created plenty of [[lulz]] to those involved, and to the users with a sense of humor. However, a number of [[fag|traditional]] anons rejected the fakes and demanded that they be b&. The mods replied with the "[[STFU]] and GTFO!" attitude that is so common to Greatestjournal users, so the fakes stayed. The original superanons, or fakes, are as follows: realmark, hasselthehoff, fakegway, faketimberlake, fakemikey, fakedrphil, and dafreshbutler. The original superanons were the ones regarded with the most [[lulz]].

Eventually, more fakes were made, by lame users who thought they were hot shit, but they really weren't. Fakes of fakes were created, and then they started getting [[retarded|really gay]]. Then they died, and the ghosts came. Everyone misses the older fakes, they just don't want to admit it to themselves.

Several other spam-anons were created between June and October of 2007.  These toll accounts were created for solely one reason: to spread terror throughout [[fuanon]].  Notable spam-anons are pr0nanon, 4chanon, guroanon, toonanon, and the infamous goreanon.

This meme is now dead.

== BIG MOTHERFUCKING COCK ==
<font size="5">mat awakened on valentines day to a dozen red roses with a thank you card from robin saying:

"last night was amazing. i just suck your big motherfucking cock all day just stroke my big fucking dick cock all motherfucking day long mmm just fuckin suck that shit dry just suck my fuckin cock just stroke that big motherfuckin fat cock all day and drink all the juicey cum drink it all fucking suck my big motherfucking cock and big saggy balls."</font>

== Fuanon memes ==

Throughout Fuanon's life, there have been countless memes. Some of these delivered big [[lulz]] and others did not:
* Washcloth
* WHO WRITE THAT
* ~Italian~ marquee and eyes like mini cds
* u
* y tho
* ICU LURKIN
* OMg..
* Failfailfail. shutup, bby ;***
* o (which followed in major drama between fake o anon and real o anon)
* stupid [[whore|gaybar's]] quotes such as "I think it's funny how most of you think you most almost everything about my life" and/or "Tell me how that what funny"
* OMFG MALES ON GJ?!?!?
* BONNIE LOVES BEAU/BEAU LOVES BONNIE
* CHIEF SLAP-A-HO

These were just some of the main memes. There are many more.

== Fuanon Picture Gallery ==

Over time a few pseudo-memes have popped up in fuanon, most notably, washcloth, and the John Lennon kid. Originally a picture accompanied by "icu lysergicacid" (since almost no one had seen a picture of him and the girls were wetting their pants over it), it has made it's way around the regulars with many people [[shoop]]ing him into compromising situations. 

Note: It's not actually a picture of lysergicacid.
