Vigouroux
<strike>[http://vigouroux.deviantart.com/ '''Vigouroux''']</strike> [[BALEETED]], aka '''"Isabelle Vigouroux"''', is a [[attention whore|child prodigy]] centrally based on [[DevianTART]]. Originally coming to deviantart to display a [[furry|menagerie]] of sonic fanarts, [http://vigouroux.deviantart.com/art/Diana-and-a-Friend-162138352?q=gallery%3AVigouroux+sort%3Atime+in%3Ascraps&qo=3 green bears], and other [[shit|furrific]] masterpieces, she turned to the [[complaints forum]] and hardly ever looked back. It has become clear that she has a talent for attracting attention; she has amassed nearly all of her pageviews purely from the [[bullshit]] drama she has [[lies|created]]. From [http://forum.deviantart.com/community/complaints/1425342/?offset=30 homeschooling] and [http://forum.deviantart.com/community/complaints/1451083/ troll comments], to [http://forum.deviantart.com/community/complaints/1457901/?offset=30 attacking ED] and [http://forum.deviantart.com/community/complaints/1475107/?offset=330 having sex at Jesus Camp and calling it rape], Vigouroux seems to have covered every retarded topic imaginable. 

Vigouroux's apparent retardation stems partly from her early years of [[homeschooling]], and her indoctrination into the [[Christian]] faith. She is incredibly sensitive. Nearly any comment towards her presents one with instant results; she will respond to almost everything with intense hostility. To anyone acting remotely[[meh| nice]] to her, she will be uncomfortably [[slut|open]]. These roller-coaster like mood swings are only topped by her routine ideology shifts. 


==Jesus Camp==

<Center>{{morphquote|Raukueconvo1|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;
|OKAY, [[troll|ASSHOLE]]. I WAS RAPED. ARE YOU FUCKING HEARTLESS? HOW DOES THAT MAKE ME DUMB? WILL YOU LAY OFF FOR A FUCKING BIT?|

|I will get an abortion if I can. I have no problems with it.|

|I was raped.
Thanks.|

|At this point, nobody believes me, not my family.. not even the [[internet hate machine|internet.]]|

|I was alone with ... a guy. And we started doing some stuff that I kind of regret now. I thought it would be okay but we were caught doing it.|

After telling her mother that she was having trouble believing in a [[lie|God]], she was sent to a local Jesus camp. She felt it necessary to alert her [[Nazi|friends]] in the complaints forum before  departing, even though they couldn’t be happier she was leaving. [[Shit nobody cares about|This was just the beginning of a story about to unfold before the eyes of deviantart complaints forum.]]

Just a few days later, Vigouroux appears again with a [http://forum.deviantart.com/community/complaints/1475107/?offset=330 posting] proclaiming “lol I had [[sex|secks]] with a boy at camp!!1 its fun to be a [[slut]]” along a few other miscellaneous complaints. The [[trolls]] on the [[complaints forum]] immediately smelled drama and flocked to the thread to tell her what a bitch she was. [[Attention whore|Realizing that not all attention was good attention]] she tried handling it in the best way she could think of- screaming [[raep]].

Obviously, changing the story from “yay I’m not a virgin anymore” to “the [[pedobear|camp councilor]] got me [[beer|drunk]] and raeped me!!1” is not exactly believable. Despite seeing that nobody bought her story, she kept peddling it, bawwwing in a journal detailing the fictional rape and acting “depressed”. It wasn’t long before she dropped the act like a mangy cat with rabies, and pretended it never happened. She deleted her journal and hasn’t mentioned it since. 

==Demise==
Unfortunately, Vigouroux didn't die IRL. But she sure seems to have left the internet completely. Sometime in between January 3rd and 4th of 2011, Vigouroux has [[BAWWW|deactivated her account from deviantART, deactivated her LiveJournal and deleted her Mysppce account, due to a troll on deviantART.]] To this date, nobody knows where she is or where else she [[Facebook|will hang out]].
If you are able to [[phish]] any emails or websites she is still active on, please place it here, [[for the lulz]].
