Futurama
[[Image:Futuramaanime.jpg|frame|center]] 


Imagine ''[[The Simpsons]]'' with less pop culture references, more [[lulz]], and more [[science fiction]] wankery. '''''Futurama''''' is an animated sitcom series set in the year 3000, remembered as a show so bad [[Fox News|Fox]] would purposely let its football games run longer than usual to ensure no one would have to sit through more of Matt Groening's eye-rape. [[Some argue|Many claim]] the show's conception was a writing vampire, draining the lulz out of ''The Simpsons'' as Groening forced the competent writers to write one-liners for an alcoholic robot.

The episodes sucked, the writing was garbage and in 2003, Fox canned the show. After much [[butthurt]], ''Futurama'' debuted four straight-to-DVD movies sometime [[last Thursday]]. Then, in 2010, Comedy Central aired the first of 26 new half-hour episodes which are [[lie|really, really good]].  

In spite of this, [[epic win|the show has spawned four internet memes]]: [[I see what you did there]], [[Child Abduction]], [[Second]], [[Hypnotoad]].

==The Show==

On New Years Eve, 1999, Fry, a Downs Syndrome patient-turn-delivery boy, falls into a cryogenic chamber and freezes himself for a thousand years. This spawned a raging fanboy base from the very beginning, as the targeted demographic are [[truth|losers and fags]]. He gets a job at the Planet Express Delivery Company with his [[Old|nephew]], Professor Farnsworth. Every episode begins with the Professor walking into a room and saying "[Blank] news, everyone!" before sending them on a nearly-fatal mission. The writers run with the premise that the future is [[orly|different than the present]], where even making a phone call is [[ironic|painfully ironic]].

==Characters==
*'''[[Retard|Phillip J. Fry]]''': In case you forget multiple times an episode, Fry is from the 20th century. He is voiced by Billy West, who also did [[truth|every other voice on the show]]. His squinty eyes ''ARE'' the [[meme]] [[I see what you did there]]. Also, [[Incest|he's his own grandfather]].

*'''[[Child Abduction|Bender B. Rodriguez]]''': A [[Black|lazy, alcoholic, chain smoking, kleptomaniac]] "bending" robot. It was [[Duh|no surprise]] when it was revealed in the third season ([[fanboi|episode one]]) that he is actually [[Mexican]]. Dreams to one day kill all humans ([[HAHAHA_DISREGARD_THAT,_I_SUCK_COCKS|except Fry]], as he reveals in an overly BAWWWWW-inducing episode).

*'''[[Mary Sue|Turanga Leela]]''': The [[Bitch|smart, independent woman character]] necessary to [[Family Guy|move the plot forward]]. Leela is a karate master, alien-cyclops-mutant-human with a good body, [[lesbian|however she cannot find another man for the life of her]]. Frequently reminded of her encounter with Zapp Brannigan. Yes, she is voiced by Peggy Bundy from ''Married With Children''.

*'''[[Old|Prof. Hubert Farnsworth]]''': [[At least 100|At least 160]] years old, Farnsworth does little else but sleep, invent pointless gadgets and yell at his employees. Notable inventions include the [[Smell Yo Dick|Smell-O-Scope]] and the [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE|'What-If' machine]]. Fills the niche of Grampa Simpson, the [[lie|HALARIOUS]] elderly man.

*'''[[Whore|Amy Wong]]''': A rich [[AZN]] from Mars who's dating the alien Kif Kroker (but had sex with Fry for an episode). Largely another channel for Matt Groening's tits-and-ass fantasies, Amy exists as the character of whom Leela is constantly jealous.

*'''[[Cthulhu|Dr. John A. Zoidberg]]''': [[oxymoron|Poor, Jewish]] lobster doctor that has only five jokes on the entire show: having no money, eating anything, being disliked, being a bad doctor and [[9/11|doing Jewish stuff]]. 

*'''[[Black|Hermes Conrad]]''': The Jamaican created to vent cannabis jokes, Hermes is a [[Bureaucratic Fuck|bureaucrat]] [[shit nobody cares about|needed to round out the collection of racial stereotypes]]. Likes to limbo and [[fap|file shit]].

*'''[[Fag|Zap Brannigan]]''': A source of lulz, Zapp is a ridiculous character used for taking pot-shots at William Shatner. He enjoys having his [[Australian|armpits shaved]] in the bath [[Gay|by his assistant Kif Kroker]]. Was intended for Phil Hartman to voice before [[pwned|he was shot by his slut wife.]]

*'''[[Pussy-whipped|Kif Kroker]]''': Zapp's lapboy and Amy's boyfriend. Despite dating Amy, [[srsly|Leela impregnates Kif in the fourth season by touching his hand]].

*'''[[Your Mom|Mom]]''': Generic coporate overlord in the guise of a sweet old lady. Has had copious amounts of sloppy, old-people sex with Professor Farnsworth in the past.

*'''[[Furry|Nibbler]]''': Leela's pet who is secretly an [[LOL WUT|ancient alien spy sent to protect Earth and Fry so he can kill giant brains]].

*'''[[Hypnotoad]]''': Hypnotoad is the worst charactALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!!!

*'''[[Second|Scruffy]]''': I'm Scruffy, [[Pretty cool guy|the janitor]]. I ain't seen you before neither.

==The [[shit|straight-to-DVD]] movies (aka Season 5)==

*'''''Bender's Big Score''''': Professor Farnsworth finds out that the retarded Fox executives have been fired and beaten to death for canceling ''Futurama'', Hermes gets [[Pwnt|decapitated]], everyone gets [[419 Nigerian Email Scams|scammed]] and Bender and Fry create a whole shitload of [[Time paradox|TIME PARADOXES!!!!!00110001001001111010000101101110011!]]. Because every paradox creates a duplicate of the character, there are [[Over 9000|over 9000]] Bender and Fry copies by the end. Reality implodes under the weight of retardation and the universe turns into [[goatse]].

*'''''The Beast With A Billion Backs''''': After Bender tore the universe a new asshole in ''Bender's Big Score'', a giant shemale [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]] called Yivo comes out of it and [[tentacle rape]]s everyone by making them deepthroat him/her/schler in one giant gangbang. Fry and Zoidberg become the leaders of [[Scientology]], Zapp fucks Amy after [[The Great Dumbledore Dies Meme of 2005|KIF DIES!]] and Bender becomes a [[pirate]].

*'''''Bender's Game''''': Leela has a fit of [[Chris Benoit|roid-rage]] and smashes the shit out of the Planet Express ship, so [[BDSM|Professor Farnsworth makes her wear a shock collar and she starts enjoying it]]. Meanwhile Bender goes [[batshit insane]] and thinks he's a knight in a [[faggotry|mystical faerie world]]. He gets sent to the nuthouse while Professor and [[Your mom|Mom]] fight over some [[Meth|crystals]]. Some weird shit happens and they get sucked into Bender's imagination. From here on in it's just the ''Futurama'' characters doing some [[LARP]] and Fry and Leela are the only two that remember who they are. Culminates in a [[LOTR]] escapade but somehow everything reverts. [[Shit nobody cares about|Also one of Mom's retarded sons (the one with the pink hair) is Farnsworth's son]].

*'''''Into The Wild Green Yonder''''': It doesn't get stupider than this: Amy's dad comes up with a [[final solution|brilliant plan]]: Blow up teh universe to make way for [[oxymoron|a giant mini-golf course]]. Fry gets a piece of jewelery lodged in his brain which allows him to read minds, but he goes insane, dons a tinfoil hat and joins [[Anonymous|"The Legion of Mad Fellows"]]. Bender has an affair with a slutty fembot called [[Ass|Fanny]], Leela and Amy become [[feminists]] and they all have a [[orgy|big hippy party]] before saving a bunch of [[meat|animals]]. The movie ends with Fry and Leela finally getting together inside the Planet Express ship and [[BAWWW|expressing their feelings for each other]] as Brannigan's ship, the Nimbus, prepares to anally rape them. Suddenly the whole cast gets sucked into a wormhole which Professor Farnsworth says could take them [[Over 9000|billions of lightyears]] away and they might never return.

[[Earth|I WONDER WHERE THE WORMHOLE WILL LEAVE THEM]]?!?!
