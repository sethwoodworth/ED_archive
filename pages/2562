Every Show Sucks was an [[illegal]] TV and Film streaming "company" on winamp, before the Corporate Cunts found out about it and pissed on everyone who enjoyed ESS's lulzy and [[porn|fun]] programming by issuing a [[serious business|cease and desist]], [[at least 100 years ago]]. Copyright [[whores]] and [[slaves]] were quick to add [http://www.al4ie.com/?p=151 spin][http://boards.adultswim.com/adultswim/board/message?board.id=5&message.id=581241#M581241], while many innocent cried over the loss.

Since the great crack down of the Grim Reapers of Law, many stations have been sacrificed on the altar of "[[serious business|Internet: serious fucking business]]" including Salt Water Chimp [http://www.saltwaterchimp.com/] and is often frequented by the [[law]]. Anyone even suspected of this heinous act must either be shot or be [[gang]] [[almost raped|raped]] by obese [[niggers]], no exceptions.
