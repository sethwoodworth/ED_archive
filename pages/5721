[[Image:NEVAR4GELEPHANTS.jpg|thumb|right|Elephants NEVER forget.]]
A hilarious catch phrase sometimes used by [[conservatives]] to invoke feelings of guilt in [[liberals]], because liberals forgot about [[9/11]] and [[Why do you hate America?|hate America]]. They also forgot [[Pole_dance|Poland]].  The NEVER FORGET! [[meme]] has inspired dozens of hilariously bad, jingoistic Photoshops and pickup truck window art --some, amazingly enough, not involving crying eagles.

==[[redundant|Emo faggotry]]==
The phrase is often used by [[emo]] fags whose friends/relatives/second cousins/tennis partner's dog/someone they're sure they've seen somewhere before died in the [[WTC]] attacks. The phrase "Never forget" will be written in [[AIM]] profiles and on wristbands, clothes, and things of that nature. Regardless of whether they actually knew the dead guy or not, these people still get really sad about it because they're [[emo]]tional [[fucktard]]s.

==Some War That Happened a Long Time Ago==

The phrase "Lest We Forget" was also used [[at least 100 years ago]] by everyone who fought on the side of the Allied "Forces during World War I.  Except [[America]]. It's mainly written on monuments to forestall the question "what's that building for?"
