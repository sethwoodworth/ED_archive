Created by Tom Fulp in 1995, <big>JEWGROUNDS</big>, in its strictest sense, is a website on the [[Internets]] that hosts [[over 9000|at least 1,000,000]] horribly drawn [[hentai]] [[Flash]] movies and 
[http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/288505 games where robots wage war against fruit] (it's been blammed).

Members are referred to as NGers, pronounced black persons, or JGers, pronounced Jew. The website is based in Pennsylvania and is run by the aforementioned fag known as Tom Fulp and his killjoy brother Wadolf, both of whom along with the majority of the community make flashes about ''cocks'', gay jokes, and sexual exploration with anal-[[dildo]] stimulation, all performed in the mistaken idea that for every [[homosexual]] comment one makes, another heterosexual point is added to one's personal scoreboard. In reality, the opposite is true, and by extension of this, all Newgrounds users are irretrievably flamboyant in regards to their orientation. [http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/846570 This fact is evidenced here.]

This site is also notable for its amazingly high degree of officially-sanctioned faggotry, ambiguously-gendered "females", barrel-scrapingly subpar Forum Moderators, and in general, users who think they're attractive, but by no means should be given the ability or impetus to procreate.[http://bonusstage.newgrounds.com][http://the-great-one.newgrounds.com]</div></div>

===The Lulz Era (1995-2004)===
[[Image:Zerowing.gif|thumb|In the beginning, Jewgrounds was a contributor to the [[AYB]] phenomenon; one of the first [[meme]]s.]]
[[Image:Newgrounds2.PNG|thumb|The most holiest of lulz and nostalgia, Jewgrounds was once the center of it all.]]
Jewgrounds in its earliest form was little more than a self-glorifying project designed by Tom Fulp (see the Administrator section below). Before [[4chan]], before [[Myspace]], this now-hopelessly polluted cesspool of a site began life as a pristine pond; a purveyor of purest, holiest [[lulz]], nearly a full decade before the concept was even imagined and mass-produced. To say that Fulp [[Al_Gore|''invented'' internet]] lulz is to stretch reality, but suffice it to say that among the earliest dispensers of e-justice, Fulp was a noble sheriff of the law and led Jewgrounds into a internet empire made entirely of pure lulz and win that even early 4Chan could not surpass.  For example, it's original tagline was "The Problems of the Future, Today!" which shows how far the site has come for it's tagline to now be the faux empowering bullshit "Everything, by Everyone."  During this time, entire countries (such as Scotland) were even considering banning Jewgrounds, of which Tom Fulp gloated about was proud (of course, that would be a no-no now, as it would hurt profits).

During the late '90s, Fulp thoroughly [[pwned]] several faceless corporate entities with what would now be considered low-brow and halfhearted attempts at humor, ie [http://www.newgrounds.com/tubby/ Teletubby Fun Land], which isn't really funny at all, and looks like complete shit. Nonetheless, Fulp learned that through his shittiness, he could do some serious fucking [[IRL]] [[Troll]]ing, and managed to raise the ire of many an executive at the BBC, as well as one infamous, middle-aged, angry female media-whore known as [http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/pennybain.html "Penny Bain, righteous crusader for all things unlulzy."]

Fulp also created a page called [http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/assassin Assassin], which hosted flash animation and games centering around killing celebrities and crappy cartoon characters, and while these games are complete shit according to today's standards, the lulz they contributed back then was priceless.  This was by far the main draw to the website in these days, as it was the most offensive and funniest thing people had seen on the internet, as was a main base for people to vent their rage and frustration against stupid crazes like Pokemon (back when it was a wordwide craze and not just some third rate game franchise) and other shit they were forced to endure from the idiotic masses.

But Fulp's most important e-exploit was certainly the [[cum|seminal]] and highly-offensive homage to Columbine, known as [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/310349 Pico's School], which managed to get him [[b&]] from almost every seriousfag memorial website dedicated to this or that contributor to the high-score count that was reached on that April 20<sup>th</sup>, 1999, and wouldn't be broken for another seven years. In this way, Fulp was way ahead of his time, and would have done well to pack it up and quit while he was ahead. But Fulp tasted the bittersweet nectar of money that he had just finished parodying, and was smitten by its power.

Jewgrounds in it's previous lulzy form can actually be viewed [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.newgrounds.com here], and it should be noted pretty much all of this material has since been deleted by Jewgrounds staff, in an attempt to make a friendly image of the site and not offend any potential advertisers. 

However, probably the most epic video on Newground at the time, and by far the funniest, was the Clock Crew's CGI movie, Juicy Fruit, found on http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/77680.  Ironically, while this was during the Lulz Era, this was the only thing of that era that was actualy funny.

During this time, Jewgrounds grew from a minor operation of [[basement dweller]]s to a legitimate business, much to the chagrin of the first wave of no-lifers (henceforth referred to as ''originals'') who made up the better part of the Jewgrounds userbase at that time but this advantage that helped nourish the site's originality would soon be the cause of its death.</div></div>

===The Imaginary Wars Era (2004-July 17<sup>th</sup>, 2007)===
[[Image:Tdy_lauer_phenomenon_050217.275w.jpg|thumb|When the constituents of your site look like this, there may be a problem.]]
[[Image:KradesException.png|thumb|right|[[Internet_law#Banaan.27s_Law|Krade's Exception]] to Banaan's Law becomes the prevailing reality on a Jewgrounds obsessed with e-rep.]]
[[Image:No_Deodorant.gif|thumb|left|Dispensing life advice becomes a fad on the Jewgrounds BBS.]]
[[Image:Ebaumtag.gif|thumb|right|Major cause of epileptic fits on Jewgrounds during the Imaginary Wars Era.]]
By 2004, Jewgrounds was embroiled in a debacle that would signify the beginning of its new era. When now-notorious [[fat]]ty Gary Brolsma felt it would be an excellent idea to [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/206373 parade his rolls of subhuman fat] around the once-lulz-inspiring halls of Jewgrounds, a new debate arose between the tiny population of ''original'' [[basement dwellers]], who were obsessed with the constant generation of new lulz, and would eventually come to reinforce the ranks of [[4chan]], and the ''new'' [[basement dwellers]], who were the precursors of the [[youtube|JewTube]]-esque userbase that is in place on Jewgrounds today. The debate centered on whether or not Jewgrounds should be allowed to drown in a pool of its own decayed shit, as the new users believed was only right and just.

Obviously, the originals left Jewgrounds, realizing the impending [[shit]]tiness that was threatening to overcome a site now dominated in sheer numbers, by sensitive and soft users, most of whom had never laid eyes on even a piece of [[goatse]]-inspired masterpiece photography, and most of whom were progressively losing any sense of humor to [[moralfag]]gotry, and other corruptive diseases to the arteries of the site.

In the originals' wake, was left a path of destruction and idiocy. Seeking to bridge the gap between what was lost and the contemporary state of affairs, Jewgrounders started to become irrationally obsessed with one particular moral cause. For some of them, a mild anger would have been justifiable, but for most, the simmering hatred aroused was completely ridiculous and unparalleled even in the more recent history of Jewgrounds. Eric Bauman, operator of [[ebaums|eBaums]], stood accused of pilfering flash directly from Jigger "artists" without first paying royalties or earning permissions. 

While it was true that Fulp performed this act, Jewgrounders' subsequent [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/276616 demonization], of eBaums was quite ridiculous, especially considering that 99.9% of the users who claimed to hate the man were bystanders who had never been the victim of theft, and who had no real reason to care, other than a faddish desire to appear as a righteous crusader, an ironic parallel to Penny Bain, above section, who was also a righteous crusader, for a similar moral reason. As a result of this artificial rivalry, recognized by nobody beyond the padded rooms of Jewgrounds's [[forum|BBS]], the odd sense of hatred spread to encompass any site that might be seen as even a remote challenge to Jewgrounds's supremacy; [[YTMND]], and later [[4chan]] were demonized in a similar manner. But bizarrely enough, despite their outward façade of hatred, and frequent accusations of conspiracy, Jewgrounders seemed to seek only acceptance from these sites, who barely acknowledged the existence of Jewgrounds:

{{quote|Are you saing your not a true member. Are you one of those Chan members trying to infiltrate your way up the ranking system? Oh and we are stupid fuckers, right? I mean, we were only able to find out their entire plan. That takes a really stupid person.|[http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/689249/2 Jigger, completely convinced] that [[4chan]] is planning to raid his website, but not realizing that nobody fucking cares about Jewgrounds.|color=#3566A2|size=550%}}

These years were blissfully happy for the majority of the Jewgrounds populace. Unable to detect the seismic [[shit|shifts]] that were preparing the way for the next startling era in Jewgrounds's history, they were ignorant and staunchly clinging to what they believed were their moral imperatives, but which were actually the beginnings of a totalitarian regime that was a complete reversal of the original principles on which Jewgrounds was based: celebration of [[lulz]].

Jewgrounds Business Plan <br />
1. Funny <br />
2. Redesign <br />
3. ????? <br />
4. PROFIT

In 2006, in the midst of the Imaginary Wars Era, a few prescient users foresaw the coming destruction of the Anti-Lulz era that was threatening to break the wall of security that they had enjoyed for so long, as Tom began to announce the coming OMG REDESIGN that so many regulars thought would completely rejuvenate Jewgrounds after the somewhat disappointingly-unproductive Imaginary War Era. These users banded together and wrote a [[lulz]]y and [[truth]]y account of the pitiable nature of the Jewgrounds populace during this time:

<div style="font-variant:small-caps">[http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/504692/1 '''FACT''']: JEWGROUNDS WAS FUNNY when we were all twelve, living in the [[suburbs]], listening to [[linkin park]], and watching dragonball z, drinking [[piss|pepsi]], while playing [[halo]] co-op on the easiest setting, during which we consumed doritos and looked at [[paintball]] guns on [[ebay]] in [[IE|internet explorer]] connected through [[aol]] on a [[56k]] modem, before hopping into our balding fathers' latest midlife-crisis-impulse-sponsored [[weeaboo|japanese]]-built suv, to head to the mall to procure more [[skateboard-city|skateboarding]] shoes, third-rate irregular levis, and mountain-bike parts, before heading home, voting [[democrat]] and [[masturbate|masturbating]] to the latest sears catalog, while huffing paint in our [[dead_babies|garage]]s before talking to [[pedophile]]s on [[aim]], pretending to be whatever [[camwhore]] we'd just finished ranting about on [[myspace]], with a [[matrix]] quote/[[anime]] character name/triple [[111|six-asterisk-parentheses-surrounded]] screenname firmly in tow, before heading to our supposedly "good [[school]]" in the morning to buy more [[pot]] to smoke during our [[counter-strike]] lan party with jimmy and the rest of the gang, taking [[Pot#Xanax.2C_Valium_and_the_Like|ritalin, adderall and prozac]] eight times a day, and at the same time taking a casual pass at local, state or national [[Politics|governmential figures,]] legislatures, or structures, to appear ''edgy'' and ''intelligent'' in front of our [[beer|budweiser]]-sneaking, limp-wristed, near-to-[[columbine]]-sociopathic "[[retarded|deep]]" friends who started to play the [[Bigger Man Argument|victim card]] as soon as they started losing arguments, which coincidentally, was six days before their botched [[suicide]] attempt, made simply because school [[whore|tramp]] number twelve wouldn't go underneath the [[cum]]- and sweat-stained bleachers with them, thereby precluding the possibility of them getting to second base before their thirteenth birthday rolled around, after which point ridicule from other insecure, like-minded, and equally virgin [[13 year old boys|thirteen year-olds]] could be virtually assured.</div></div></div></div></div>
<div class="AntiLulz">
<div style="background:#758FB8;padding:10px">

===The Anti-Lulz Era (July 17<sup>th</sup>, 2007-Present)===
On July 16th, 2007 the site experienced a 'big' [[web 2.0|redesign]] with features such as "New Emoticons" (Happy Face, Sad Face, Angry Face), Secret Items ([http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/6949/picture1copyir2.jpg actual screenshot] of "secrets"... one has to wonder how [http://tomsdad.newgrounds.com/ Tom's father] feels about his son's late-onset prostitution fetish), level icons (including a [http://licon.ngfiles.com/level59N.gif half-naked male body], golden-tan and glistening with sweat), auras (including the meaning-laced "[http://licon.ngfiles.com/level59F.gif Fab]" aura), and blogs as part of the userpage package (a prime example of which can be found on the userpage of the intellectual heavyweight known as "[http://thebutt.newgrounds.com/ TheButt]"). This event marked the end of the Imaginary Wars Era, and few today even possess a memory of the time before this cataclysmic event took place.

[[Image:Newgrounds_Idiotic_Increase.gif|center]]

Since the inception of the much-lauded "Redesign" of the website, a general decline, if that description is even applicable to a site that consistently demonstrates its ability to find new depths of oblivious idiocy, has occurred amongst both the user base of this decidedly-virgin populace and the features of the site itself. These new features include, but are not limited to: [[Weeaboo]] pandering, copiously-sprinkled [[penis]] jokes, and a forum that steadily delves into lower cesspools with each passing "[http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/892749/ Pee in your sink!]" thread, "Rate my [hallucinatory] Girlfriend!" thread, or even the occasional, but obligatory "[http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/892763 Announcement of Impotency]" thread.

The increasing Nazism of Administrators and Moderators (see sections below "Administration," "BBS→Moderators," and "BBS→Community Members→Corrupt Administrator" for [[moar]] info) has even  caused a downward spiral of idiocy in the Forums, which were already polluted during the Imaginary War Era with disgruntled [[moralfags]].

All of this is damning proof that Tom cares little about what his site used to stand for (angst-ridden teens bent on [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/195194 having a good time] at school?), and would now prefer to change it into a Gaiaspace clone-cum-Faggot Hang-Out ([[money|$$$$]]) rather than clean out the nobly-named "Kitty Krew" flash group's incredibly [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/392919 thought-provoking] analysis of the human condition. It's been a long road from [[lulz|passable social critique]] to active encouragement of Anti-Lulz in the post-redesign era, but what's become clearer than ever in the past two years is that this cesspool of cowshit sure as fuck isn't getting any shallower.

[[Image:Newgrounds-Adblock.png|thumb|left|150 px|They really hate adblock.]]Until just [[Last Thursday]] Jewgrounds was run by [[communists]]. [[fag|Tom Fulp]] wanted to have the [[communist|Chinese]] buy their [[Shit|Merchandise]] so they blocked out everything [[porn|above T rated]] They stopped being sponsored because the commies wanted to remove [[Shit Nobody Cares About|the forum, deny comments to flashes, and the flash and audio portals.]]. Meanwhile the three dominant memes of the site such as [[BEDN]] and [[Dancing Owen]] would soon follow the fate of moving out of the BBS and into the Flash Portal as its own independent flash.

To this day, Tom Fulp continues to show complete and utter contempt for the casual browser and whatever remaining fanbase he has left by starting an advertising campaign that makes petulant demands to anyone blocking ads to over [[Shit Nobody Cares About|a bazillion internet RPGS]] to visit the shop and buy crap nobody wants.

<big>UPDATE!</big> Recently all ads at the bottom of the page are for Gaia. The redesign was mainly fit for marketing, it seems, as there are ads on new submissions and Gaia ads everywhere. Way to go, Tom; you've taken the Jew safehouse that was [[newgrounds|Jewgrounds]], and transmogrified it into the equivalent of [[Nazi]]-fascist MySpace. I'm sure [[Wade Fulp|Your brother]] was most pleased.<span class="co;[-];[+];0;nazi;default"></span>

<big>ANOTHER UPDATE!</big> On the subject of more ads, if you are enough of a faggot to have an account on Newgrounds an ad is placed, without your consent, on your userpage profile. That is, if you haven't posted in [[Shit nobody cares about|your blog]] or haven't really contributed content to the site, you get the benefit of being greeted by Zwinky ads at every waking moment of your sad, female-depraved existence.

<big>[[OMG]] [[MOAR]] UPDATE!</big> In yet another attempt to make Newgrounds exactly the same as [[MySpace]], as well as every other site on the [[Internet]], you can now embed your [[unfunny]] videos into your blog. [[Oh exploitable|Mass exploitation]] is expected, assuming NGers can work out how to actually embed them in the first place.</div></div>
