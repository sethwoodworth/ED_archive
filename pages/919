'''Ben Johnson''', a senior (4th year student) at the University of Iowa, is the secretly [[gay]] Chairman of the Iowa Federation of College [[Republicans]]. The Iowa Federation of College Republicans is the largest, [[fail|most successful]] [[No Cussing Club|youth-based political organization]] in the state of Iowa, with clubs on over 20 of Iowa's college campuses. It is their mission to train, [[drugs|energize]] and [[terrorist|mobilize]] college students to help elect Republican candidates by providing [[Scientology|grass-roots manpower]] to campaigns.

Ben, a double-major in [[emo|psychology]] and [[Nerd|physics]], flamboyantly leads [[Over 9000|more than 7,000]] Iowa college Republicans. Before college, Ben Johnson started three [[retard|Young Republicans]] clubs at Prairie High School, Cedar Rapids, as well as in in other nearby high schools. 

==What is Iowa==

For the benefit of those fortunate enough not to be in the USA, the central US farming state of [[Iowa]], just west of [[Chicago]], has a [[lie|unique]] and [[tl;dr]] role in selecting the presidential nominees of the two major political parties, the [[Democrats]] and the [[Republicans]]. Iowa also has more meth labs per capita than any other US state.

==The video debut==

In November, 2007 Ben recorded two videos with "Iowa Independent," an organization specializing in being "[[bisexual|undecided]]" about such things as "[[Yes|Is George Bush an idiot?]]" during the 2004 election, right up until election day. On these videos, which were posted on YouTube, Ben gushed about how totally excited he was to be a <s>Gay</s> Young Republican, and it became perfectly obvious to the [[Gaydar]] of people who aren't even gay that this guy is a <s>dancing</s> [[angry asian man|raging]] queen.

'''Ben [[penis|Johnson]], more like [[buttsecks|Ben Dover]] [[amirite]]? Ben gaily asserts that [[bullshit|the Iraq War is the necessary "retribution" for 9/11, and that George Bush only has a "communication problem."''']]

'''Ben explains his very personal commitment to supporting [[torture|"The Troops"]] by sending them [[penis|beef jerky]] and staying in school.'''

==From Ben's campaign to become Chairman==

{{tinyquote|From a [[infantilism|young age]] I enjoyed keeping the [[prostitot|money I earned]] and therefore became a Conservative. I also enjoy nice browns of [[jenkem|pipe tobacco]], a [[fursuit|fine suit]], some [[fetish|hometown family values]] and [[penisbird|flag-waving]]. '''Make love after war'''. - Ben Johnson}}

Dear National College Republican Leaders, Chairman and Distinguished officers,
<font color="red">
As some of you may or may not have seen, my YouTube interviews have been raising quite a bit of controversy ( and dare I say venomous hatred?) online and in some national media outlets. As my respected colleagues I would just like to personally clarify a few things to you,</font>
<font color="blue">
#I am not actually gay, even though the way I dress and talk may betray that fact ever so slightly, ha.
#Some people are responding angrily in my defense and as I truly appreciate you support please do not stoop to their levels. We are above them in so many ways and I like keeping it that way.
#Solders in Iraq really do love beef jerky! I have the thank you letters to prove it. I encourage all of you to send them tons of it!</font>
<font color="green">
On a small side note, I find it strange that the ever so tolerant and accepting-of-all-lifestyles-Left have no problems calling me every gay-bashing offensive name in the book. Guess it just goes to prove that nothing is offensive or intolerant so long as your insulting a Republican. But none of it bothers me. If I am not hated by the Democrats, I am not doing my job.</font>
<font color="purple">
Two final quick things,

I am initiating Iowa’s Operation Iraqi Christmas for the fourth year in a row and I would love to encourage all of you to be apart of it. Please visit http://www.anysoldier.com. This site is amazing! It is like a facebook for the US military serving in Iraq, and every solder has their picture up and personal Christmas wish list listed now! It is an incredible way to make an impact in the lives of these armed service men and women who fight for freedom every day. I have my chapters serving about three solders a piece, so Iowa will be sending 91 packages with our CR stickers plastered all over them so the troops know exactly who
is supporting them. I also will be sending a CR poster to every battalion with my email address asking for a thank you picture with our poster, those kind of pictures are priceless for good publicity! Just some Ideas.</font>
<font color="darkorange">
Secondly, I would like to encourage all of you to join me for the Iowa Caucuses! Even though actual caucusing is reserved only for Iowa residents, there are plenty of great events going on across the state and I promise you will not be bored, which is rather rare in Iowa. I have the complete schedules of where all the candidates will be speaking during the day as well as VIP invitations from each candidate to their after parties. It would be my honor to have any of you join me for this amazing political experience! So please contact me if your interested!</font>
<font color="hotpink">
I just want to say what an honor it has been working amongst such great Americans like yourselves! Thanks for your support and see you all soon!<br>
Benjamin A. Johnson<br>
Chairman<br>
Iowa Federation of College Republicans<br>
