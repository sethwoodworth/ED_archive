'''Jasmine Richardson''' is a [[13 year old girl]] who knifed her family in the name of the [[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy|Worldwide Furry Conspiracy]]. At 13, she is the youngest killer in [[Canadia|Canuckistan]] and was a regular user of the super cereal [[emo]]-[[gangbang]] known as [[Vampirefreaks]]. Besides being a [[goth|Goff]] and getting [[in the ass|stuck in the hole]] for a decade, she is also the hottest piece of [[JB]] to commit murder [[EVAR]]. Rumors indicate that Sean O'Neill has already prepared for Jasmine a $[[9000]] a month contract with [[Suicide Girls]] to be their head pinup, right beside [[Nazi]] superwoman RAPE BLOSSOM. She has declined to comment upon whether or not she will take [[Pimp]]master Sean up on this offer.

==The Aftermath==

The judge sentenced Jasmine for 1st degree [[murder|IRL permabannage]] to the fullest extent of the [[lol]] for a [[age of consent|minor]], which means 10 solid years of [[Pruno]] and hairy-lipped [[cunnilingus]] from [[Tori Sue Heck]]'s extended family. It is unknown whether or not the [[fursuit]]s will be considered contraband or allowed for conjugal visits.

==Trivia and Conjecture==
