'''Sgt. Slaughter''', or Robert Remus, is a true [[American]] [[hero]]. [[theredskull|Due to the death of Captain America]], Slaughter is noteworthy [[Professional Wrestling|pro wrestler]] because not only is he a lover of [[drama]]; but more importantly, he is the official mascot for the Empire of the [[Bush]] dynasty. Slaughter was later made into a G.I. Joe, which was later recalled from stores after repeated instances of children losing eyes over the overly pointy crotch of the figure. 

In a related story, the G.I. Joe commercial holds evidence that Sgt. Slaughter is [[retard|extremely well educated,]] and an [[fag|immaculate, well annunciating speaker.]]
