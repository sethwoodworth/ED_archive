'''Gabe Newell''', '''Gaben''' or '''Gay Ben''', is the head of [[Valve Corporation]] and is famous for being a [[fat]] yet cheerful soul. Gabe spends his days at work eating, sleeping and delaying ''[[Half-Life|Episode Three]]''. Whilst doing all of this, Gabe gives out games for free in order to distract Half-Life fans from the decade-long wait for their most-wanted game.

==History==
Gabe was thrown out of [[University]] for eating his roommates. From there he went to work at [[Micro$oft]], scoring millions of dollars and then ditching the company years later to create [[vidya]] gaems.

Gabe soon thought up ''[[Half-Life]]'', where the protagonist was opposite to him in every way (thin, good looking, etc). ''Half-Life'' took over 2 years to make due to Gabe revising his ''Valve Time'' technique.

After almost making himself bankrupt, Gabe released ''Half-Life'' and got rich again. He used the money to develop [[Steam]], attracting [[13 year old boys]] all over the globe. He also found groups of suckers who created games such as ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' and ''Day of Defeat'', employing them and making money off of their work. CAPITALISM, HO!

Gabe then made [[Half-Life 2]] 6 years after its prequel. He and his company now stick to updating the same old games to use newer engines rather than working on making new games, which explains why the Half-Life 2 episodes took so fucking long to arrive and why one of them doesn't exist yet (Spoiler: it never will).

To this day ''Valve Time'' is proven to be successful since Gabe has been using it on Episode Three since it was supposed to come out in [[2005]]. Valve's fanboys continue to defend the title, proving that ''Valve Time'' helps to keep fans attached to the games. Gabe has also distracted his fans with releases such as ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'', ''Left 4 Dead 2'', ''[[Portal]]'' and a bunch of other titles.

Today, Gabe still runs Valve and continues to delay Episode Three. Calling Gabe fat via the Steam Community extends the delay by at least 10 minutes.

==Gabe's interviews==
[[tl;dr]]

In short, all of Gabe Newell's interviews can be summed by this: "We're currently [[Not|working]] on [[Portal|blah]] [[Half Life|blah]] [[Team Fortress 2|blah]], and a [[Goatse|big surprise]] will be revealed [[Nevar|really really soon]]!"

==Gabe's official theme song==
I want to be the very fat<br/>
Like no one ever was<br/>
To develop them is my real test<br/>
To delay them is my cause<br/>
I will travel across the couch<br/>
Searchin' far and wide<br/>
Each piece of food to digest<br/>
The power that's inside!<br/>

Gaben!<br/>
It's you and me.<br/>
I know it's my destiny!<br/>
Gaben!<br/>
Ooh you're my best friend<br/>
In a game we must delay!<br/>
Gaben!<br/>
A heart so true<br/>
My stomach will pull me through<br/>
[[Vore|You eat me and I'll eat you]]<br/>
G-A-B-E-N!<br/>
(Gotta delay 'em) Gotta delay 'em Gotta delay 'em all!<br/>


Every game along the way<br/>
With hunger I will face<br/>
I will eat everyday<br/>
To claim my rightful place!<br/>
Come with me, the time is right!<br/>
There's no better team<br/>
Arm and arm, we'll piss the fans!<br/>
Episode 3 always been a dream!<br/>


Gaben!<br/>
It's you and me.<br/>
I know it's my destiny!<br/>
Gaben!<br/>
Ooh you're my best friend<br/>
In a game we must delay!<br/>
Gaben!<br/>
A heart so true<br/>
My stomach will pull me through<br/>
You eat me and I'll eat you<br/>
G-A-B-E-N!<br/>
(Gotta delay 'em) Gotta delay 'em! (Gaben!)<br/>


Gaben!<br/>
It's you and me.<br/>
I know it's my destiny!<br/>
Gaben!<br/>
Ooh you're my best friend<br/>
In a game we must delay!<br/>
Gaben!<br/>
A heart so true<br/>
My stomach will pull me through<br/>
You eat me and I'll eat you<br/>
G-A-B-E-N!<br/>
(Gotta delay 'em) Gotta delay 'em Gotta delay 'em all!<br/>
G-A-B-E-N!<br/>


tl;dr another [[Pokemon]] ripoff.

==Emails sent to Gabe==
Gabe sometimes responds to emails sent to his [mailto:gaben@valvesoftware.com corporate address] no matter how lulzy they may be.

==/v/'s visit to Gabe==
Around August 2010, [[v/|/v/]], in their wholehearted love for Gabe, sent Gabe an email with an image containing hundreds of signatures from /v/ users. Gabe responded the next day inviting /v/ to the offices of Valve. Whether /v/ will go or not is unknown since their charter buses are likely to break down under the [[fat|weight]] of so many /v/irgins.

/v/ plans to visit Gabe sometime later in 2010 (considering they don't forget to go). Their strict set of rules mean there will be no [[underageb&]], [[furries]] or [[women|girlfriends]]. This makes shit easier (no responsibly of retarded kids, no furry pride crap and no repetitive whining about how everyone in the bus stinks of [[manchild]] sweat).
