OSDL
The '''Open Source Development Labs''' (OSDL) is the non-profit organization that is responsible for developing the [[Linux]] kernel, and also employs [[Linus Torvalds]] and [[Alan Cox]].  Whatever controversy happens in the Linux world, the OSDL is somehow involved.  When [[SCO]] sued [[IBM]] and demanded people pay licensing fees for Linux, the OSDL was there.  When [[Sun Microsystems]] attempted to [[open source]] [[Solaris]], the OSDL was there to mock it.  And whenever there is an internal squabble going on within the OSDL, there is always someone leaking it to the media.

[[in the ass|Bottom line]], the OSDL shows that geeks are nothing more than 13-year-old girls trapped in hairy, [[fat]], mid-life male bodies.  On the upside, the OSDL [[faggots]] have big [[tits]].
