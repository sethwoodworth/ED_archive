Bam Margera is a [[Faggot|Pro Skater]] who skates and stars in his own [[Gay porn|reality shows]] on [[retard|MTV.]]

<s>Awesome Skateboarder
Awesome Actor 
Just Awesome!</s>

[[Douchebag|A fine upstanding citizen on MTV]]

==Fun Facts==
*He dresses like a [[goth|gothfag]] and cries when he's around [[snakes]].
*He is somehow liked.
*His reality show is gay because he knows that really, in reality, his reality show sucks cocks.
*Nobody likes him because he's a really big fucking fucktard and his [[gay|dick got touched by his uncle]] [[pedo|vito]].

==Bam Advertises Himself==

Like many of the world's most hated [[EBaum|thiefs]], Bam wanted to steal an icon that he would use to [[shameless self-promotion|promote himself]] unto the [[retards|masses]]. The heartagram (which looks like an upside-down Jew star with [[boobs]] sprouting from the top) was [[rape|taken]] from [[Emo|HIM]] because Bam happened to like that [[Shit|band]]. Also, he [[Jesus|believed]] that by taking the logo for his own use, [[Idiots|people]] will think he has a large penis, but he's just a [[poser]]. [[Amirite]]?

==Vam==

[[Image:Vambuttsecks.png|thumb|"SRPRZE BUTTSCKS!111"]]

It is a popular belief among many [[16 year old girls]] interested in [[fag|Homosexual Relationships]] that Bam and the frontman of the Finnish band HIM, Ville Valo, (the guy he stole the heartagram from) are secretly [[fucking|in love.]] While this may be true, there is not enough evidence to confirm that Margera really is a [[gay|fudgepacker.]] Ville, though, has openly confessed his love for both [[bisexual|teh vagina and teh cock.]] 

"Vam" is the [[stupid|clever]] portmanteau of some [[fag|genius]] noticing that, if you insert part of "Ville" into "Bam" (GET THE PUN?), you get "Vam." This is not the unquestioned name for this pairing. From this idea have also sprouted varios seeds of [[faggotry]], such as "Dugera" (Bam x his hobo-friend, Ryan Dunn). But suprisingly the VAM fanfom produces very good fanfiction compared to others.

Fanfics are easy to write.
#Start with a cheesy plot line.
#Have one man or the other [[masturbate]] to the other.
#Have the opposite walk in and see them.
#Badly written sex scene.
#[[????]]
#[[profit|PROFIT!!]]

It is common for a [[16 year old girl]] to become obsessed with this pairing for [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|over 9,000 years]], get bored, and move on to some <s>sexier</s> more faggoty pairing.

=TV Shows=

==Jackass==
Bam is a regular on the show [[jackass|jackass]], where he likes to have everyone plug him with gold dildos and pube beads. [[srs|srsly]]. He is well known for being the complete and utter [[pussy]] of the crew, his most daring stunt to date being jumping into a swimming pool [[loser|from about 10 feet high]].

==Viva La Bam==
[[Image:Whatbamdoesforajob.JPG|thumb|This what the bastard really does for a job]]
[[Last Thursday]], there was a TV show about Bam who staged his retarded antics to the horror of his illegitimate parents. Every episode seemed to have followed this basic plot: 

*Bam comes up with some asinine scheme: "Okay, on today's show I'm gonna make my dad [[fatass|Phil]] run around in a [[Duke Otterland|diaper]] and it's gonna be soooo [[Lame|badass!]]"Alternative: build ramps EVERYWHERE

*He then drags all his friends and [[Your mom|family]] into said plan: "Hey guys, when Phil gets home we should check and see if he crapped himself. And then, we're gonna make him eat his shit!"Alternative: at least 100 people skate all over the rubble of his home which has now been converted to a skatepark for the 4th time

*And on occassion, there will be a [[W|special guest]]: "Holy [[shit]] it's some wrestler [[noone|no one]] ever heard of! We'll have him watch Phil eat his own shit! I'm so [[Aspie|awesome]]!"

*Obligatory breaking of objects: "Now I'm gonna break some windows!"

As long as all of this criteria is met, the [[Jews|producers]] have done their work.

[[At least 100]] episodes of Viva La Bam were produced until the show became [[poor|unprofitable]] just to make way for more contrived [[faggotry]]. This meant that Bam had to find other ways of making himself popular once again, even if he had no other choice than becoming [[an hero]].

==Bam's Unholy Union==
Early this year, Bam got a new crap show on MTV that is a [[ripoff]] of the Newlyweds called Bam's Unholy Union. Even though folks who like Bam will happily watch his little antics, [[some argue]] that the show and the marriage will eventually [[fail]], leaving Bam to either find another half-assed reality show and [[vagina]] to plug or find alternate forms of [[buttsecks|work]]. There's lots of opportunities out [[Hell|there]].
==Drinking Binge==
Following his marriage to a [[lie|wonderful]] [[woman]], Bam became heavily involved in [[alcohol|drinking]].  After a 4 day binge, his [[Cock Trapper|loving]] [[whore|wife]] called the [[Cops]], who promptly called an ambulance.  Bam confessed to the EMT that drinking was the only thing that could drown out his wife's harpy-bitch nagging.  The two are now in couple's therapy, where Bam is being taught how to properly take care of his [[in the kitchen|woman]]
