Shrooms
[[Image:Trippinballsmushrooms.jpg|thumb|Yeah, that's about [[Wrong|right]].]]

All '''mushrooms''' contain psilocybin, a powerful, fun hallucinogenic drug.  The common myth that only certain mushrooms are edible and that some are dangerous is propagated by [[Jews]] to control the market.  Look for white mushrooms with caps, bulbs, full veils, and about 2-4 inches high.  [[Bill Nye|We happen to be experts on this]].

==Basics of shrooms==
Mushrooms work best on an empty stomach, and [[some argue|some find it helpful]] to enlist a friend, one who is too much of a [[pussy]] to take drugs himself but nonetheless desires acceptance from drug users, as a "sitter." A sitter is a sober person present with you throughout the trip -- there to assure you that you aren't having a psychotic breakdown, as well as to prevent you from interacting with [[NORP|other humans]] during the experience.

====The trip====
Upon eating mushrooms, at first the consumer will think he hasn't taken enough (two grams) and will consume requisite five grams more.  This is followed by a gradual escalation of losing your fucking mind, peaking in three to four hours of utter terror.  The experience of thoughts and visual sensations heretofore accessible to only the most renowned luminaries of art and philosophy is overshadowed by the overwhelming realization that [[you]] are [[poor]], your parents hate you, your house is a filthy and flimsy piece of shit, and you are not where you ever hoped to be in life.  Meanwhile, although you know perfectly well that no one has ever died of a psilocybin mushroom overdose, you can't help but wonder if perhaps you'll be the first, or if your friend-of-a-friend actually sold you batch of [[#Fly_agaric|one of ''Psilocybe'''s lethal cousins]] -- all you know for certain is that you are helplessly witnessing [[the cancer that is killing /b/|fast, permanent, and irreparable damage being done to your own intellect]].

<center>Remember: Repeated use will turn you into an [[azn]] [[furry]].</center>


Note: if you can still operate a computer, you haven't done enough.  Eat [[moar]].

====The Comedown====
Rather suddenly and by some miracle of [[Raptor Jesus|Jesus]], the terror subsides, providing you an hour or so of lucid thought.  Have paper and pencil to write down every single amazing idea and goal on how you want to change your life.  After this, the trip fades entirely with no [[hangover|negative lingering effect]], as though you may as easily have spent the day watching TV and doing housework, rather than squirming about hysterically on the floor for seven hours, struggling for dear life to maintain hold on reality.

Shrooms can also make you miss [[pics plz]]:

==Fly agaric==
'''''Amanita muscaria''''' or '''Fly Agaric''' (AKA the shrooms in [[Super Mario Bros.]]) is one of the most aromatic, sweet and delicious mushrooms available on the world market.  The culinary trade treasures this fungus because it is easy to cook and can turn  bad piss into beer.  Notable users include the Smurfs, Mario the Plumber, and Alice in Wonderland. Remember, taking more than half a cap will [[truth|fuck you up]].
