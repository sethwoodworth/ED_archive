Bird is the word
<br>
{{Forced Meme}}

'''Bird is the word''' is a [[Cancer that is killing /b/|meme]] based on a [[lame|"popular"]] song sung by [[Green Day|some band nobody cares about]]. The song itself -''Surfin' Bird''- was made in 1963 by the [[Faggot|Trashmen]] and later made into [[WIN]] when [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSHpyPTZw4A The Ramones] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a98umoWh7VU The Cramps] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sMB6dye29Q Pee-Wee Herman himself] [[ruin|covered]] it. The original song sucked horribly and did little more than become a joke among faggots, trolls, and [[You]]. Despite popular belief that [[Family Guy]] came up with the joke, its actually been around [[At least 100 years ago|for years]]. While totally [[lame|cool,]] its best used by [[Whore|bored trolls]] to mess with [[Emo|Emos]] in [http://www.emochatcity.com/ EmoChatCity], as they despise Bird is the Word and trolls often going by the name of Noddy. One troll went under the guise of PeaTearGriffion but turned out to be [[Fag|White Knight]]. On 4chan, this meme doesn't last more than 3 replies before being 404'd. [[Lemonparty|With good reason]].

== Reasons why this isn't a good meme ==
# Every newfag thinks it's hilarious.
# It's about as funny as Milhouse.
# Family Guy sucks.
# The Bird is only equal to or greater than the word.
# They forget about the Original Bird
