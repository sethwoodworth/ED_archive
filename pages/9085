Willy on Wheels
[[Image:Willys-Knight1920.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Willy's Logo]]
'''Willy on Wheels''' is [[Wikipedia]]'s most prolific [[vandal]], beloved by many, and hated by few. He exploits the fact that the Wikipedia developers foolishly enabled page moves for all users. And what better thing to do than add "on wheels" to the title of every single page? His legend is so great that many have imitated him, making names like his. Little do they know that they cannot beat perfection.  Many women and even some men have asked to marry him, just to get close to such a god.

Sick, perverted [[Wikipedo]]s brainwash their children into being sick fucks by telling stories of mass page move [[vandal]]ism attacks, [[sock puppet]]ry and mother[[fuck]]ing [[Pain series|PAIN]]. But why? His miraculous use of the move function to put Wikipedia articles in their proper place is proof that where most practice [[furry|furry love]] and call it [[Esperanza|wiki love]], Willy's love and care of the wiki is beyond all others.

==The original WoW==
[[Image:Snrub.gif|thumb|left|A WoW impersonator]]
WoW's tale begins on the 20th of August, 2004.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Willy_on_wheels ] Willy, being the chivalrous, kind, loving individual he was, decided to give himself to the Wikipedia, and lead them to the [[porn|holy land]]. He quickly moved off, pushing and pulling, shifting and [[dicking|shafting]], doing whatever he could within his powers. But alas, the people who he trusted most, the [[wikipedophile|''wikipedophiles'']] betrayed him. Handing him over to the [[furry|furfag]]s, he was banned for their sins. He was resurrected, but was banned again by those he ''trusted''. The cycle continues forevermore, World without End, ''ad infinitum,'' Amen. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bad_jokes_and_other_deleted_nonsense/April_Fools%27_Day_2005/Willy_on_Wheels_for_admin He was nominated for adminship] on Wikipedia for all his wonderful work.

The original WoW was also the only person to successfully hack into Wikipedia's site. Aside from replacing the main page, he also did <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Recentchangestext&diff=prev&oldid=9368509 this lulzy action]</span> and <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Recentchangestext&diff=prev&oldid=8728809 again, better this time.]</span>

The move logs of the original Willy no longer exist, but one can still spot him on the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Block log|old block logs]].

==Adoration from fans==
:''"This makes him "The Michael Jordan of vandals"; a true virtuoso of the craft, the gold standard to which all future vandals will be compared. Since he [http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-October/031780.html retired in October of 2005], Wikipedia lost a bit of its character; though like the beloved Elvis Presley, imitators will ensure that he will truly never be forgotten. Here's a toast to Willy: May your wheels always stay mobile."''

[[The Guardian]] calls Willy an [http://technology.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2042368,00.html "infamous vandal]," and the [[Old media|New York Times]] weighs in with:
:''"Willy on Wheels, a <span style="background-color:yellow">[[Legendary ruin status|legendary]] Wikipedia user</span> whose vandalism consisted of adding the words “on wheels” to the headlines of literally thousands of entries. <span style="background-color:yellow">Uncountable hours</span> were spent deleting those two graffitilike words from all over the site. He or she even <span style="background-color:yellow">spawned numerous copycats</span>, and to this day, anyone whose user name contains the phrase “on wheels” runs the risk of having his or her editorial privileges summarily revoked."''

Sysops pay their due:
:''My feelings on this matter are mixed and perhaps a bit complicated. Willy on Wheels has been a presence on Wikipedia for a long time than many of our current sysops. I remember him vandalizing [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent Changes]] on Christmas Day – a rude if somewhat amusing surprise (especially as no one seemed to remember where the proper MediaWiki template was). "On Wheels" is a recognizable Wikipedia meme, which befits one of our most prolific vandals."'' -[[Wikipedia:User:Mackensen|Mackensen]]
