Check your facts
"Check your facts" is a [[catchphrase]] developed by people who do not know their own [[facts]]. They say this in order to save [[time]].  

It goes something like this:
:[[Futhman]]: All [[Jews]] eat [[babies]]
:[[Quasidan]]: Not true, my Hebrew school teacher told me that only about 10[[%]] of all Jews eat babies.
:[[Futhman]]: Check your facts

While Quasidan goes to check his facts, Futhman has [[time]] to develop a serious rebuttal.

"Check your facts" can be used in conjunction with [[Occupatio]] (see below) as a way to guarantee victory to any [[flame war]]rior:
: [[Futhman]]: Prima: You're a stupid [[Furry]], ''plus'' you will now go [[check your facts]] to make sure you have the proper definition of "furry". That's why you're such a good [[lol-cow]].
