==George Rekers==
The Reverend Professor George Alan Rekers is a [[not gay|heterosexual man]] who spends all of his waking hours trying to prove that homosexuality is bad. He has multiple degrees from multiple institutions, and instead of getting a useful job that pays actual money, he sucks the churches dick and [[ex-Gay|converts homosexual men]] into gods chosen sexual orientation, [[heterosexuality]]. He even started the [[KKK|Family Research Council]], an organization dedicated to making homosexuality punishable by burning at the stake, along with James Dobson, whose first book ''Dare to Discipline'' encouraged parents to beat their kids.  Dobson also earned over a million dollars for his taped interviews with fellow upstanding American Ted Bundy.

==Scandal==
{{quote|Like Jesus Christ, I deliberately spend time with sinners with the loving goal to try to help them.|George Rekers, forgetting the fact he paid $75 a day to be in the presence of this man}}
Like all fags in denial, George was bound to [[Buttsecks|relapse]]. When he did, an [[troll|outstanding citizen]] managed to snap a picture of him in the process. Instead of denying that the picture is of him as most people would, he went on the offensive claiming he was trying to convert him, even though the sinner was found on a website for gay male prostitutes and the prostitute in question was balls deep in his ass at the time. The honorable <strike>senator</strike> man of god decided it would be a good idea to go on a 10 day [[Cocksucking rampage|all expenses paid vacation to Europe]], and to remedy his cravings, he brought a rentboy along for the low cost of $75 a day. [[buttsex|$75 got him 8 hours of companionship]], 2 meals together, and at least one [[Fisting|"sexual massage"]] a day. Naturally, when this was found out, a media [[shitstorm]] occurred, and [[lulz]] were to be had by all.
