Micah Armstrong is a [[batshit insane]] evangelist, possibly more insane than [[Kaliph Jamal]], who tours [[college|Colleges]] and [[university|Universities]] in America with his [[incest|wife/sister]] Elisabeth. Like all [[Christians]], Micah hates everything that isn't Christian and lets people know about it, making him a gigantic, religious [[troll]] running on the fumes of burning [[Wiccan|Wiccans]]!

I'M WATCHING THIS GUY TALK RIGHT NOW...HE SEEMS PRETTY REASONABLE, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

== His mission ==
''"To preach the Bible publicly on the streets, college campuses, and at big events; calling sinners to repent of all sin, believe on the Lord [[Jesus]] Christ, and live a life of holiness and obedience to the teachings of the Bible, and train others to do the same."''<br/>
Which is another way of saying:<br/>"Troll everyone and everything that isn't good and Christian like me!"

== Evangelical antics ==
His evangelical antics draw a crowd like a bearfight in [[Russia]] and it is not uncommon to hear him calling perfectly non-Christian people "loose sorority sluts", "voracious faggots" and "[[Osama|terrorists]]".
Micah is not completely crazy, since he knows that [[fact|women are the root of all evil]]: 
{{quote|Beware men, there are loose [[women]] on campus out to [[rape|seduce]] you. You wonder why you don't see any [[crackwhore|crackwhores]] in Ybor City anymore. [[Your mom|These women]] are putting them out of business.|Brother Micah|on [[women]]}}
He even stands in the rain whilst delivering his messages!
Wow!  That much dedication shows that he is right and you are wrong!

== "Its not okay to be gay" ==

Micah's number one hit on the [[god hates fags]] record label is a [http://moami.proboards78.com/index.cgi?board=lva&action=display&thread=1171342360 catchy little tune].<br/>
''"I've got news for you homosexuals,''<br/>
''sodomites and lesbians who ''<br/>
''think that it's OK to be gay,''<br/>
''God says it's not OK. ''<br/>
''It's not OK to be perverted. ''<br/>
''It's not in your DNA.'' <br/>
''What you need is to be converted.''<br/>

== The not so great Easter Sunday raid of 2007 ==
On the 8 April 2007, a small group of EDiots raided Micah's forums, producing mild lulz with pictures of [[Jesus]], [[Pain Series]] and [[Last Measure]]. The raid was short and sweet, with accounts being banned within a few hours and the forums becoming [[friends only]]. However, registration was still open, paving the way for...

== The great Micah forums raid of April 2007 ==
From the top secret depths of [[ED IRC]] came a small band of EDiots bent on producing more [[lulz]] from Brother Micah and friends. They enlisted the help of [[7chan|7chan's]] [[/i/]] with [http://txt.7chan.org/i/res/38660.html this thread] to get more troops, and soon the raid was in full swing. With more religious conumdrums for the righteous souls at ROAM-USA.<br/>
The forum now remains [[friends only]], and the only solution for Micah and his friends was to [[delete fucking everything]]. ED declares [[victory]]!
