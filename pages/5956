Ohloh is a [[Internet|website]] where [[open source]] developers count the times they [[wank|wanked]].
Its content is roughly disguised because the open source sect is afraid the rest of the world learns how frequent they wank.
So, when you see on this site some [[nerd|open source person]] did a "commit", or has written a "line of code", it means he wanked. Often, some developer handjobs another as a sign of submission. Such an act is referred to as a "kudo".

There is a ranking with [[You_Win_the_Prize|medals]] between developers based on their wank count and handjobs received.

Another website for open source wankers connection is Advogato.
Contrary to Ohloh, it has different levels of [[BDSM|submission]], including [[Asking_for_it|voluntary anal rape]].
