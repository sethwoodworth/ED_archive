The '''Gay bomb''' is an informal name for a theoretical [[gay|non-lethal]] [[cum|chemical]] weapon, which a United States Air Force research laboratory speculated about producing.

In 1994 the [[gay|Wright Laboratory]] in [[Ohio]] produced a three-page proposal of a variety of possible nonlethal chemical weapons, which was later obtained&mdash;complete with marginal [[lulz]] jottings and typos&mdash;by the [[gay|Sunshine Project]] through a [[gay|Freedom of Information Act]] request.

In one sentence of the document it was suggested that a strong [[fag|aphrodisiac]] could be dropped on enemy troops, ideally one which would also cause "homosexual behavior." The aphrodisiac weapon was described as "distasteful but completely non-lethal." In its "New Discoveries Needed" section, the document implicitly acknowledges that no such chemicals have been discovered. It is not known whether this chemical has been developed further. The document also included many other off-beat ideas, such as spraying enemy troops with [[goatse|bee]] pheromones and then hiding numerous beehives in the combat area.

"The Ohio Air Force lab proposed that a bomb be developed that contained a chemical that would cause enemy soliders to become [[gay]], and to have their units break down because all their soldiers became irresistably attractive to one another," Hammond of Berkeley's Sunshine Project said after reviewing the documents. "The notion was that a chemical that would probably be pleasant in the human body in low quantities could be identified, and by virtue of either breathing or having their skin exposed to this chemical, the notion was that soldiers would become gay," according to Hammond.

== Trivia ==
*The gay bomb was actually developed in secret and tested in [[San Francisco]] in 1973.  This is what caused [[Tfo|so many of the city's residents]] to become faggots.
*Most argue that [[Uncyclopedia]] has been dramatically crippled by the effects of [[Gay]] Bomb.

== Use on French Blacks ==

Hayes and colleagues studied 40 [[Black|African]] clawed [[French|frogs]], keeping them in water contaminated with 2.5 ppb (parts per billion) of atrazine. (The [[Hippie|EPA's]] current drinking water standard is 3 ppb.) "Ten percent of the exposed genetic males developed into [[Tranny|functional females]] that [[Gay|copulated with unexposed males]] and produced viable eggs," the researchers wrote.
