Cease and Desist
{{elaw}}

A '''Cease and Desist''' order is an [[IRL]] legal document telling you to [[STFU]], possibly [[GTFO]]. These are most commonly issued to [[noob|nubs]] who don't know when enough's enough. [[Luser]]s [[OL|on the internet]] love to threaten "Cease and Decist!" orders when they're [[butthurt]], however it is near impossible for them to act on such threats, as Cease and Desist orders are reserved for [[Jews|large corporations]]. At such a time a C&D order is received, you can be sure to view [[at least 100|hundreds]] of [[Slashdot]], Wired and [[Digg]] posts regarding it. This process is continued ''ad naseum'' until the [[luser]] dies, or [[GTFO|decides to leave]].
