Google bomb
'''Google bombing''' is the process of influencing a [[website]]'s ranking on [[Google]] search results by linking multiple sites and [[blog]]s to it. Most Google bombs are created for the sake of initiating [[irony]] and [[lulz]] on the [[internets]]. Occassionally, controversial and offensive Google bombs will also create large amounts of [[drama]], providing even further [[lulz]].

==History==
The official discovery and coinage of the term "Google bomb" was [[allegedly]] made in 2002 by some [[nerd]] and [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22talentless+hack%22&btnG=Google+Search talentless hack] named Adam Mathes. Mathes had gotten into an argument with his graphic artist friend Andy Pressman and, like any [[Internet tough guy]], was far too [[pu55y]] to deal with Pressman [[IRL]]. So he made fun of Pressman [[OL]] by linking his website to unflattering insults. In reality though, the original Google bomb was actually created in 1999, dealing with some company that is [[Microsoft|more evil than Satan]].

==How it works==
Because Google ranks webpages in its search results by how many sites link to that page with the same anchor text, a Google bomb can easily be achieved by having only a few sites link to the target page. When a user then types the anchor text into Google and [[Google#I Feels Lucky|feels lucky]], he/she will be taken to the target webpage even if the page does not have the said text.

Google did not do this with the intention of google bombs.  Rather, they intended that whenever you search for something, you always get a bunch of unrelated websites.

==Examples of drama caused by Google bombs==

These links no longer work as Google is a lulzkiller, but it does work in other search sites that still rank sites by the above method, like [[Yahoo!]] or Cuil.

===Miserable failure===
When [[liberal]]s Google-bombed [[George W. Bush]]'s presidential biography to link to '''[http://www.google.com/search?q=miserable+failure Miserable failure]''', many [[conservative]]s were naturally enraged. They then countered by linking [[Michael Moore]]'s website to second place on Google's search results for "[[miserable failure]]".

More recently the target had changed to [http://simcity1.10.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=154 Simtropolis] (that's the evidence) because of Obama being made president.

===Jew===
For a time, typing '''[http://www.google.com/search?q=jew Jew]''' into Google's search bar would link to [http://www.jewwatch.com/ JewWatch], a friendly Jewish support organization and division of B'nai B'rith. However, this was later reverted by another Google bombing campaign by the infamous anti-Semitic hate-group [http://www.jewschool.com JewSchool]. It now links to [[Wikipedia]]'s entry on [[Jews]].

===Firefox 1, IE 0===
[[Mozilla Firefox]] fanboys and other assorted [[furries]] have linked '''[http://www.google.com/search?q=1 1]''' to Firefox's homepage and '''[http://www.google.com/search?q=0 0]''' to [[Internet Explorer]]. Recently, however, 0 has been associated with Firefox as well, and in fact has more Firefox entries on its first page than 1.

===Bunch of luddites===
'''[http://www.google.com/search?q=%22bunch+of+luddites%22 bunch of luddites]''' <s>links</s> linked to the [[MPAA]].

===Santorum===
Mmmmmmmm, frothy. '''[http://www.google.com/search?q=santorum Santorum]''' is what happens when Dan Savage decides you are [http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=tsunami&spell=1 pwned.] There is a Senator Santorum, who is a noted [[cunt|asshat]], but otherwise totally not important. [[Santorum]] is an [[old meme]].

===Dangerous cult===
'''Dangerous cult''' used to provide the official $cientology website as the first hit. It fell to the second hit, after [http://www.cassiopaea.org/cass/Laura-Knight-Jadczyk/fastest_growing_cult.htm the most dangerous cult in the world]. Co$ did manage to [[bribe]] Google enough to get it taken down, but the damage was done: [http://www.google.com/search?q=dangerous+cult the first result page is splattered with unforced Scientology-related links]. Should have paid extra for the full censorship package, huh?

===French Military Defeats===
'''[http://www.google.com/search?q=french+military+victories&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-a French Military Victories]''' links to a fake google redirect for French Military Defeats. Since that page has not been updated to go with Google's visual redesigns over the years, even the most blithering idiot can see something's wrong.

===I can read Wikipedia===
Links to TOW's article on black person [http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=i+can+read+wikipedia&aq=f&aqi=g5&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=]
