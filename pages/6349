Perfect Dark

Hailed as one of the greatest shooters evar, '''''Perfect Dark''''' is the [[bisexual]] sister of ''[[Goldeneye]]''. Why do I call it bisexual you ask? Because you get to play as a [[white]] [[woman]]. Sites such as [[IGN]], [[Gamespot]], and [[Gamespy]] gave the game unanimously biased reviews. This is just what the [[Nintendo]] [[fanboys]] needed to make themselves feel better about their [[child|casual-gamer]] based console.

==Why It So Good?==

It so good because you get to play as a female, something which no [[gamer]] has [[Metroid|ever]] [[Portal|seen]], evar. However, they will try to cover it up by saying the game is good because of its [[porn|graphics]], [[sex|gameplay]], [[your mom|design]] and [[Wii|innovative controls]], but we all know they're [[lying]]. The game's multiplayer mode also was praised, but it was pretty much pointless seeing as <s> gamers have [[no friends]] to play it with. </s> <s> Idiot, you can vs bots in multiplayer </s> NOT EVEN BOTS WILL WANT TO PLAY WITH THEM.

Should you ever be unfortunate enough to be in this game's presence, your [[final solution]] should be to [[an hero]] before it [[Russia|corrupts the glorious youth]]. Despite it been called "better then ''Goldeneye''", it was outsold by James Bond by 6 million copies. Jesus fucking Christ! It should also be noted that the game is half-baked. Half the guns are [[stolen]] from ''[[Goldeneye]]'', most of the maps are slightly redesigned versions of ''Goldeneye'', and the plot is essentially the same, but [[Metal Gear Solid|no one plays games for their plots]]. Besides, if you want to play a game as a female that did it first and better, play fucking ''Oni'' by Bungie.

==Sequel==

Being the [[trolls]] that they are, [[Microsoft]] decided to arrange a [[holocaust|hostile takeover]] of the company who made the game, Rare. This caused Nintenfags to [[RAGE]] because of the fact that this company brought them many delicious games like ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', ''[[Banjo Kazooie|Banjo-Tooie]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong|DK64]]'' and not to mention, ''[[Goldeneye]]''. 

With this, [[Hitler|Bill Gates]] forced Rare to create a sequel to ''Perfect Dark'' so they could cash in on its glory, not like he needs it, [[faggot]]. Rare managed to shit out '''''Perfect Dark Zero''''', a game to be released on the [[Xbox 360|Failbox 360]]. Although, in a deliciously ironic twist, Rare [[troll]]ed [[Microsoft]] by creating a [[shit]] game that could only average 7/10 from game reviewers. Bill then boom[[headshot]]ted the CEO of Rare in an act of [[frustration]].

==Literature==
When a game becomes so [[popular]] it has its own series of [[porn|books]], you know something is fucking wrong (refer to ''[[Gears of War]]'', [[Runescape]], and [[Mario]]). Not surprisingly, this happened after Microsoft took over Rare.
