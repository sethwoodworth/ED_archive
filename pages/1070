'''Bob Griese''', college and pro football star, known for his excellent play-by-play work for [[ABC]], and his tireless efforts to promote several charities is really a racist dipshit.  He perfectly exemplifies the saying: 

''"Build bridges all your life and they call you a bridge-builder, but during that time, if you suck one cock, one tiny insignificant cock...you are know as a cocksucker no matter what else you do."''

[[Sex Panther|Bob Griese]] is a racist that attended Purdue university to play football.  While there, he was a racist.  He was drafted into the [[NFL]] and was the quarterback for the Miami Dolphins and is one of the members of the only undefeated team in NFL history.  He was also a racist.  After his racist career in the NFL, Griese went on to be a racist for ABC Sports and for ESPN.

While being a racist is fine, and while being racist on television is even better, it is never a good idea to use the wrong racial slur when talking about a certain inferior race.  During an Ohio State/Minnesota football game, commentator Chris Spielman asked his booth-mate Bob Griese "Where's Juan Pablo Montoya?" who is a popular Columbian [[NASCAR]] driver.  Griese, attempting to display his vast racist skills, failed miserably when he applied the wrong slur and replied "He's out having a taco."  The controversy started when people realized that there are no tacos in Columbia.

Further controversy was made when Griese, bowing to pressure from the wetback community, apologized for his remarks.  ESPN, realizing that Griese had made such a grave error in racial insinuation, suspended the commentator for a full day.  Montoya, who had never heard of Bob Griese up until that point, stated that he did not care, leading many experts to believe that Montoya was actually happy to have been upgraded from "Columbian Swine" to "Dirty Mexican" by Griese on national television.
