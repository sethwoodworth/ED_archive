After spending much of his early [[children|childhood]] as an [[Irish]] lady-boy, where he met fellow [[Old media|journalist]], and hate-spewing cunt [[Ann Coulter]], Michael was adopted by the soon to be first consul and fortieth [[president]] of the [[United States]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. [[Last Thursday]], he became [[butthurt]] when he found out Mark Dice, a known anti-war activist, was sending videos and letters to soldiers in [[Iraq]] saying that [[9/11]] was an [[9/11 Truther|inside job]]. He immediately started encouraging his listeners to seek out Mark Dice and anyone else who agreed with his views to [[murder|shoot]] them. 

{{quote|Excuse me folks, I'm going to say this. We ought to find the people who are doing this, take them out and shoot them. Really. Just find the people who are sending those letters to our troops, to demoralize our troops, do what they're doing, you take them out, they are traitors to this country, and shoot them. You have a problem with that? [[Deal with it]]. But anybody who would do that doesn't deserve to...to live. You shoot them. You call them traitors, that's what they are, and you shoot them dead. I'll pay for the bullet.|Michael Reagan}}
