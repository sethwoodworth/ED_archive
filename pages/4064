'''Microsoft Niggernet Exploder''' is a malicious form of malware which is designed to slow down computer performance and frustrate users. Due to Swiss cheese-like security, it is susceptible to [[raep]] by nearly every exploit imaginable.  In less than 5 minutes, the average IE installation will [[Fail]] as it becomes saturated with [[Skullworm|worms]], [[Alexa|unwanted tool bars]], and [[AIDS]].

<s>Somehow though, it is the most popular web browser, controlling 60% of the market.</s> [[Firefox]] is now the most popular Internet browser, controlling 45% of the market.

==Virus or not a Virus?==
Though it appears to spread like a [[virus]], it lacks the small size and stealthy behavior which is commonly associated with viruses. Furthermore, the bulk of its propagation happens not through the [[internets]] but through the [[real world]] where [[monopoly]] was used to pre-load it onto [[computer]]s and hide it on [[Windows]] [[operating system]] disks; a practice which got [[Microsoft]]'s [[ass]] [[sue]]d by... well, basically by [[everyone]].

Internet Explorer will eat your children, no questions asked.

Also if [[Java|JavaScript]] is enabled, any website can hack your computer with things like making [[9000|Over 9,000]] [http://www.ryancordell.com/design/pop.htm pop up windows].  Or disabling mouse buttons and keyboard buttons so when you click them they [[Goggles|don't work]] and it says, "Don't steal my pictures" -- if the latter ever happens you just got hacked.  As a public service, you must turn JavaScript off and then steal every one of the pictures from sites like this.
(Or you could always highlight it and press CTRL+C, to save you the trouble of finding where the option is in Internet Explorer's crappy layout)

== Indian Programmers ==

Internet Explorer is programmed by a highly trained team of [[Indian]] specialists. These specialists are world wide recognized for their talents and everyone praises their mothers when Internet Explorer crashes.
Most of these highly specialized <s>giggolo's</s> programmers work in high tech labs, such as in the desert, or while on [[Toilet_Seat|Toilet]]. That explains why Internet Explorer works so great.
Notice that they sometimes use turbans to boost their intelligence and make better crappy version. Especially when making upgrades (more bugs). 

You should not be deceived by that picture in the right. That is not an ordinary Indian desert. That highly specialized IT man is actually working in AREA 51!!! And that picture was taken by a spy satellite while he was upgrading Microsoft Internet Explorer.
