'''Jumping the shark''' originated from the 1970s show ''Happy Days'', when the Fonz literally jumped a shark in one episode. It was all downhill from there. Since then, the term has been used to discuss [[TV]] series.  It is now applied to nearly anything that might potentially have a climax. It may also refer to a show that had previously climaxed, and is now relying on gimmicks to keep it moving.
The phrase is used by [[douchebag]]s who consider themselves original and cool because of their early involvement (as [[fans]], not contributors of any kind) with a series which was once obscure but later became popular (e.g. ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''), because any change means that the creators of the show are evil money-grubbing bastards who don't care about their audience.
