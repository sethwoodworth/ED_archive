When epic idiocy met [[Internet]] [[atheism]], the Rational Response Squad was born. The '''Rational Response Squad''', or '''RRS''', are a [[cult]] of [[butthurt]] demagogic evangelical [[atheists]] and wannabe grassroots <s>attention whores</s> [[Attention whore|activists]]. Their [[Shameless self promotion|goal]] is to use negative tactics, sexual gimmicks, and idiotic [[memes]] to ram their inane ideological propaganda down everyone's throat. They set out to accomplish this by getting their ass handed to them on radio shows nobody listens to, <s>making [[YouTube]] videos</s>, maintaining a user-surly unsearchable website consisting of eight active members and [[your mom]], as well as broadcasting internet radio shows in a private [[webcam]] [[Chat|chatroom]]. They are [[Fail|revolutionaries]]! However, as of 2008, they have retreated into stasis and cower from any public debate or confrontation not on their own web site. This is done so they can exercise their authority to censor dissenting opinion of anything deemed unfavorable. Ironically, with these characteristics, as well as their desperate attempts to [[Troll|provoke]] religious people into an extreme rage to validate their own [[Emo|fragile]] egos, [[Lol|they have become the mirror image of everything they profess to dislike]]. They are [[Irony|irrational]].

[[Image:RRRSCAR.jpg|thumb|240px|The Rational Response Squad proudly showing off their "patrol car" on their website.]]

The Rational Response Squad's extreme hatred towards people who believe in [[God|imaginary sky daddies]] is very irrational, most of it being a fairly clear expression of a desperate need for validation through rabidly hypocritical behavior. Also ironically, in their quest to "disprove" [[God]], they have become moar dogmatic in their belief system than any [[Pedophile|priest]], [[Fitna|imam]],  Jew, [[feminist]], [[homosexual]], [[Truther|conspiracy theorist]], [[fantards]], or [[New age|new age hippie]] -- [[evar]]! Even moar dogmatic than [[You]]. Thus proving that although the RRS have [[Google|all the answers]] regarding [[God]], they still need the comfort and shelter of the [[LOL WUT|religion]] that [[Cult|they created out of atheism]].

The RRS claim to have "[[Rich and beautiful|rich and powerful]]" financial backers (PayPal and [[Your Mom|Brian's mom]]) that have enabled them to [[cult|live in a house together where they constantly wear their own RRS-branded t-shirts]] and spend 24 hours a day on [[Stickam]] and [[YouTube]] "speading the word about atheism." While this is typical of [[goatse|cult behavior]], it is currently unknown whether or not the group is [[waco|harvesting firearms]].  Will hopefully [[an hero|go out in style]].

Despite having "[[rich and beautiful|rich and powerful]] financial  backers," Brian Sapient claims to only make $5,000/year. They presently use ChipIn and managed to con members into donating $560 as of November 2007. Presently they are advertising on Google Ads but keeping the details [[Lol|secret]]. "We are worried about sabotage from the fine folks who would like us to remain silent." However actively targeting [[Christian]] sites makes such security moot.  

Using Google Ads, the RRS expects to attract "highly intelligent people as well from varying areas from psychology, biology, evolution, cosmology, physics, and more." But anyone with a basic background in history understands their ultimate goal of classifying all religious belief as a mental disorder has been tried by other [[Stalin|totalitarian]] states and has led to huge violations of human rights. They presently only attract [[morons|idiots]] too susceptible to the mob mentality, and always will.

===Fun facts===
* They like to [[Shameless self promotion|brag]] to [[Wikipedia]] that ''"Their site has climbed heavily (up 4M) on the [[Alexa]] rankings since the original AfD"'''. In fact, an improving [[Alexa]] rank to 170,000 means the ranking has gone from abysmal to merely awful. Still not a decent ranking.

* Like to claim that there is "[[Crap|scientific proof]]" that over 50 theists have become [[atheist|atheists]] because of the Rational Response Squad. This demonstrates how little they understand about the [[logic]] and science they [[Crybaby|preach]] about, as well as the controlled studies required to make such a scientific claim. Their "[[Crap|scientific proof]]" is the [[Irony|same kind]] of [[Bullshit|anecdotal evidence]] that [[fucktards]] use to prove the efficacy of [[Priest|faith healing]] or [[Lol|homeopathy]].

* Claimed to [[e-lawyer|sue]] Uri Geller when he falsely DMCA'd one of their [[YouTube]] videos, when in fact they probably just filed a standard counter notice.

* They are known to aggressively patrol their [[Blasphemy Challenge]] entries on [[YouTube]] and give negative comment points to anyone that disagrees with them. Obviously, an excellent source to troll. Also, dongz.

{{quote|I am especially putt off by Brian Sapient's paranoid insinuation that anyone who disagrees with his approach might be a "Christian" in disguise. I think he sounds a lot like a recovering Christian fundie who cannot shake his former habit of burning heretics. If that is the only "alternative" he envisions I wonder why anyone should bother in the first place.|[[Pedobear]]}}

===Internet media whores===

Like all good wannabe [[smpfilms|internet media whores]] RRS created an advertisement on [[Wikipedia]] which was promptly deleted only to be reinstated three months later after a dedicated campaign and sexual favors produced a passing mention in a Newsweek article and one mention in a [[Fox News]] blog.  

One Wikipedian, a college friend of [[morons|Brian Sapient]] and former member, stated that "the RRS is blatantly biased, and incapable of understanding this bias by lacking the ability to discern between fact and opinion. It is a feat, to say the least, that this group is more criticized among atheists and "freethinkers," (including me) than among the religious themselves[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rational_Response_Squad]."

The RRS actively targets "[[retards|young people]]" to perform acts which create controversy and raise awareness on their behalf. The most famous is [[The Blasphemy Challenge]]. Lesser known was their poorly conceived idea Burning Burqa Challenge. Core member Kelly's Tits expressed willingness to take the challenge but was discouraged by Brian's fear of retaliation and the idea of having sex with her severed head. Such a good example of their cultural intolerance, and disregard to the safety of their followers, they have since removed their videos related to the Burqa Challenge.

===FreethinkingTeens - for 30 something pervs===
[[Image:Freethinkingteens-Nikki-Frye86.jpg|thumb|180px|[http://profile.myspace.com/nikki8686 Fyre86/Nikki86] These fridge magnets were sold after she turned 18. Yay! - ]]

Like any good treehouse cult, the RRS has a number of front groups. Among them is Freethinking Teens. According to the RRS, "[[Jailbait|young people]] are the most vulnerable to religious indoctrination, we feel it is important to reach them."[http://www.blasphemychallenge.com/faq.html] Reach them, and tell these "free thinkers" what to think. He reaches them by convincing them they are the largest most hated minority[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbay-nPxxfI], Rook Hawkins' soft porn [http://www.rationalresponders.com/the_pleasure_cruise] (ample moaning and warm breadth [''sic'']), and the Blasphemy Challenge.

You have to wonder about [[Basement-dweller|thirty-something adolescents]] shaping young minds. According to Rayven Alandria [http://www.myspace.com/rayven_alandria] [[Pedo|Brian Sapient]] bought then [[Jailbait|17-year-old Nikki/Fyre86]] a [[webcam]] in exchange for her [[masturbation|masturbating]] in their Stickam channel[http://www.rantsnraves.org/showthread.php?p=363831#post363831] sometime before February 2007 [http://www.rationalresponders.com/forum/the_rational_response_squad_radio_show/general_conversation_introductions_and_humor/4681]. But according to [http://www.myspace.com/nikki8686 Nikki's Myspace] and [http://www.youtube.com/user/Fyre86 YouTube profile] she is  20-years-old, born April 17th, 1988. So anyone who bought a Freethinkingteens refrigerator magnet, the odds are damn good that Nikki's tits were 18 at the time.  According to sources, she loves lube.[http://rationalresponders.blogspot.com/]  

No one to date has backed up Rayven Alandria's story. But there is every reason to believe if [[Desperate|you are 18-years-old and have nice tits]], you might be selected to show off your goodies for [[Cult|Freethinkingteens.com]] and [[Cult|RationalResponders.com]], and might get a free [[webcam]] to boot. There is no evidence to support the claim that they are anything but regular [[Sick fuck|internet pervs]].

Nikki now spends her time not in school helping [[Poser|Rook]], [[Stupid|Sapient]], and [[Who cares|Tomcat]] with the newest project, the [[Bullshit|RRS Academy]] where they ''claim'' to teach [[Lol|college level courses]], just without those pesky degrees or letters after their names. Don't bother with anything like [http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/courses/av/index.htm MIT's free online course-ware,] RRS classes are taught by a real [[Conspiracy|Jesus Mythicist]]!

[[Image:Freethinkingteens-darth-josh.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Pedo|Darth_Josh]], the 30-something [[Sick fuck|pervert]] who made teen fridge magnets.]]

Update: RRS sychophant [[Pedo|Darth_Josh]] [http://www.rantsnraves.org/showthread.php?p=488513#post488513 verified] that the Nikki masturbation episode [[Oh noes|did indeed happen]].

<blockquote>
:''Originally Posted by [[Detective|IGExpandingPanda]]''

:Righto, here is where I honestly get confused.

:At first I thought this was Darth_Josh, but it's sounding much like Brian fucking Cutler.

:This is likely why he's getting defensive about the 17 year old remark. At some point, usually about 20 to 23 you have to figure out that YOUR the adult. I don't know for a fact if he got Frye to masturbate, but I've pretty much established that she was 18 turning 19 at the time, and so long as she's not lying about her age, this is at least legal, well, save any minors who were in skype at the time, which actually I don't know the rules on this.</blockquote>

In replying to the post, [[Basement-dweller|Darth_Josh]] claims that the Nikki [[masturbation]] RRS show happened "[[At least 100 years ago|a long time ago]]".

<blockquote>
:''Originally Posted by render (AKA [[Basement-dweller|Darth_Josh]])''

:Nope. It's me. darth In the cyber flesh. Too bad you'll never get the real story. It wasn't even skype.

:That has to suck. It was also a LONG time ago. You'd think she would have called the cops or 'to catch a predator' by now.
</blockquote>

The only thing that can be verified is Nikki's age at the time of the incident. She claimed to be 17-years-old when it happened, although her [[Myspace]] page would put her at 18-years-old at the time. It's claimed that there were at least two young [[13-year-old boy|13 to 15-year-old]] boys in the [[Stickam]] chat room at the time, but they have not come forward to verify this claim. Suffice to say, whether Nikki was 17 or 18-years-old, it's pretty clear that Brian Sapient likes to take advantage of immature young girls and get them to play porn star for the cameras. Interesting, since we now know his girlfriend Kelly is a [[Prostitute|licensed prostitute in Nevada]] and [[Pr0n|sex webcam girl]].

[[TL;DR|In summary]], the RRS aren't a bunch of pervs using their cult status to prey on young girls, naaaah, they are here to save us from the mind disorder called theism!

===Financial – The RRS is freedom from getting a damn job===
The RRS claimed to be on the verge of filing for non-profit status, and in the mean time, anyone wishing to donate more than $1,000 can e-mail Sapient for instructions on how to subvert the IRS by donating to a charity which would give them [[money]]. However, in April 2007 an "anonymous investor" helped Sapient buy a $340,000 house. Had he filed as a non-profit, he wouldn't enjoy the benefits of such a generous gift. His new claim is he wants to remain anonymous so [[Christians]] won't go after him, but it's more likely he wants to avoid transparent accounting associated with a non-profit organization.  

The RRS generates income in the following ways:

#Subscriptions Bronze - $3, Silver - $10, Gold - $25 monthly 
#T-shirt & Media sales
#Referrals – Google ads, Amazon, Evolve Fish
#General donations 
#Pooled donations Hosting/Server & Advertising
#Subverted funds through legit non profit organizations
#Room Rental 

Sapient claims donations over $1,000 can be processed though a non-profit organization who "will use the [[money]] to pay their portion of the server fees." The [http://www.fsgp.org Freethought Society of Greater Philadelphia] has been informed of their vile attempt to deceive the public and the IRS reportedly has no such arrangement with the RRS. It's presently unknown what sucker will co-operate with Brian Sapient's questionable business practices.    

{{quote|If you would like to make a donation of over $1,000 we can arrange for you to pay directly to a non-profit organization (tax deductible) who will use the money to pay their portion of the server fees. Contact Sapient to make such an arrangement.}}

* It's rumored that Brian Sapient has NO fear of the [[the man|IRS]]
* They freely admit to embezzling funds 

Presuming they only had 200 subscribers at the bronze level, 1% of the number of members they claim to have, that would be $7,200. Their hosting expenses have increased from $75/year to presently $1,300/year to handle a message board that has an average of 120 messages a day. Even taking the cost of the server, claimed to be $2,600, that still leaves $3,300 to spare. Brian Sapient estimated the site pulled in $55,000, roughly 10% of the [http://ffrf.org/ Freedom From Religion Foundation's] gross.  

'''None of their subscriptions go toward hosting their website.'''

Instead Sapient wants an extra $11,600 for a site that gets an average of 120 messages/day. This will cover another server costing $3,000, another host costing another $800/month. Why? Kelly's Tits explains, "You are making such a fuss about the money when it's clear that we don't make enough for me or Rook to stop working and for Brian to not take money out of his personal savings." So by their own admission they want to quit their day jobs and be full time [[serious business|activists]].  

While "an anonymous investor" shelled out $204,000 for the $340,000 house, Sapient owns a 39% share of the house dedicated for the RRS enterprise. A 1% share was sold to Rook Hawkin's bimbo, one [http://k9sbyte.stumbleupon.com/ Lori K9sByte]. It's not an issue of standards, she's just clinically brain dead, see photo[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:RRS-Lori-K9sByte-dog.jpg].  

[[Image:RRS-Kelly-on-publicoversight.jpg|center|thumb|683px|Kelly's Tits thinks people should just take it on faith that the money goes where she says it goes. [[What|Wut?]] Isn't faith irrational?]]

Kelly's Tits offers her opinion on those who question the organization's finical management:
* Sapient whines about getting $17,000 out of savings, when [[your mom|an anonymous investor]] shelled out $204,000 for his fucking house.  
* The RRS wants YOU to pay their way through life, plus an extra $11,600 to support their hobby. 
* They want both the benefits of a non profit & a commercial business. I.E. free labor and all the bucks in their pocket.
* Their supporters are such morons they don't know they are funding a poor business plan.

==The "theism is a mental disorder" claim==

Recently, the RRS posted a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yta7HSWerIk video to promote their long-standing campaign to have theists categorized as having a "Grandiose Delusional Disorder"] (Changing scientific definitions to promote your own agenda? [[Creationist|Now where have I heard that before?]]) added to the DSM (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) based on 16 points:

* The patient expresses an idea or belief with unusual persistence or force.
* That idea appears to exert an undue influence on his or her life, and the way of life is altered to an inexplicable extent.
* Despite his profound conviction, there is often a quality of secretiveness or suspicion when the patient is questioned about it.
* The individual tends to be humorless and oversensitive, especially about the belief.
* There is a quality of centrality; no matter how unlikely it is that these strange things are happening to him, the patient accepts them relatively unquestioningly.
* An attempt to contradict the belief is likely to arouse an inappropriately strong emotional reaction, often with irritability and hostility.
* The belief is, at the least, unlikely.
* The patient is emotionally over-invested in the idea and overwhelms other elements of his psyche.
* The delusion, if acted out, often leads to behaviors that are abnormal and/or out of character, although perhaps understandable in the light of the delusion.
* Individuals who know the patient will observe that his belief and behavior are uncharacteristic and alien.


<div style="text-decoration:blink; color:blue; text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-size:365%; width:9em; line-height:1.1em;">Ironically, the RRS exhibits all of these symptoms.</div>


===Why "theism is a mental disorder" is [[retarded]]===

Not only did they steal this amazing edgy new theory straight from [[Psychologist|Albert Ellis]], the fact that atheism can also be construed as a delusional disorder based on a generalized non-specific list of behaviors escapes them. "The patient expresses an idea or belief with unusual persistence or force." Remind you of [[Your mom|anyone]]?

What does this prove? It just proves that they taking something out of context and [[E-psychiatry|abusing psychology]] to promote a biased agenda.  

The Retarded Response Squad supported [[bullshit|this claim]] by saying that they were backed up by [[noone|some psychologists]].  One of these was the [[whore|big titted]] [[slut|concubine of Brian Sapient, KellyM78]], who had (according to Sapient) ''"<s>understood</s> read [[porn|some books]] about psychology"'' and was ''"in no way a [[idiot|biased agendaist [sic]]]"''. As with all bozos who think they understand psychology they fail to grasp some fundamentals, such as the fact that even the [[American Psychiatric Association|APA]] [http://www.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/200604.pdf doesn't support shrinks imposing their own religious/spiritual, nor antireligious/spiritual ideas on others] let alone [[Obsessive-Compulsive_Disorder|unqualified, narcissistic dickheads]].  

Rather than admitting there is no support for their [[Obsession|Quixotic crusade]], they feel that somehow they are ahead of the curve and will get religion classified as a mental disorder in the DSM-5 or 6. This is about as likely as getting into [[Heaven]] by eating the flesh of a Jewish zombie.

===Supporting their claim using work that has [[irony|already been rejected by the author]]===

The RRS cited Dr Albert Ellis as support for their [[bullshit|theory]] that [[GTFO|"Theism is a Mental Disorder"]].  Dr Albert Ellis is the psychotherapist who developed cognitive REBT therapy; however the [[TL;DR|essay]] they use to support this position was later discredited by none other than [[lulz|Dr Albert Ellis himself]] in a subsequent essay in which he stated the glaringly obvious fact that [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Journal+file-a0146997774 only the really crazy evangelical rapture believing hell and damnation creationists could be in any way described as having unhealthy delusions].  

In short the RRS's completely unscientific and unsupported crusade to have theism categorized in the DSM as "Grandiose Delusional Disorder" is "a idea or belief which is, at the least, is unlikely and is expressed with unusual persistence or force in a humorless and oversensitive way" that when "an attempt is made to show that the belief is false is likely to arouse an inappropriately strong emotional reaction, irritability and hostility".  

Considering that this flawed idea resulted in the formation of the RRS - it is sensible to suggest that "the idea has exerted an undue influence on his or her life, and the way of life is altered to an inexplicable extent."

==The Richard Dawkins Foundation distancing themselves from the RRS==

January 4th 2008, according to [[Fag|Reed Braden]] of the blog [[Shit nobody cares about|Unorthodox Atheism]] and the podcast "Two Smokin' Hot Freethinkers," your friendly neighborhood pan troglodytic boobs -- [[Stupid|Brian Sapient]] and [[Prostitute|Kelly's Tits]] decided to join five other [[Retard|atheists]] in a conference call where they tried to start a [[rumor]] that [[Richard Dawkins]] himself was having [[Rape|an affair]] with a member of the new management staff.

Why attack their lord? Reed explains the new managements at the Richard Dawkins Foundation (RDF) got annoyed with the RRS, "riding the coattails of Professor Dawkins into pseudo-stardom," and took steps to [[Defriend|distance themselves]] from the self-proclaimed [[Internet celebrity|king and queen]] of atheism. When pressed for proof the RRS ''claimed'' it was confidential. Interestingly enough, just before Reed's blog was published the RRS pulled all pictures on their website that showed themselves and [[Richard Dawkins]] together, as well as all [[YouTube]] videos of [[Richard Dawkins]] in their hotel room.

[[Stupid|Brian Sapient's]] response was, "I get the feeling you are a christian of some sort masquerading. I will likely file suit against you in the future. As it's only gonna become a bigger story." So in short, the RDF takes steps to [[Defriend|cut]] the imaginary connection to the RRS, Brian Sapient and Kelly's Tits [[Butthurt|start a rumor]] about Richard Dawkins to get someone fired, someone blogs their transparent attempt at retaliation, and Brian Sapient resorts to the usual bullying tactics and emotional appeals failing to realize had he just dropped it in Skype there wouldn't be anything to blog about.

==RRS vs RD.net - Who's #1?==

Since being [[Cock block|cock blocked]] from the Richard Dawkins website, Brian Sapient has been on a [[Insane|crusade]] to prove their website is [[Winnar|better]]. To this end he's been actively getting users of this site to download the [[Alexa]] [[Spyware|tool bar]]. Kelly's Tits explains the two day drop in their ratings was a result of the RRS being [[Abortion|black listed]] from [[Alexa]], a matter which was "resolved." Since their campaign began, they managed to overtake [[Scientology|RichardDawkins.net]] in page views, but not reach, making the end ranking suspicious to say the least. When asked Kelly's Tits responds, "[[Butthurt|I'm done with this retarded conversation. Thread closed.]]" 

Between February 21, 2008 and March 23, 2008, the RRS's three month [[Alexa]] average somehow managed to climb above [[Scientology|RichardDawkins.net]] in ratings, a fact they were so very proud of, or rather something they [[Spam|spammed]] everywhere to show advertisers to get money. However, it was the height of hubris to make this claim when trying to compare your self to a site which has maintained the higher [[Alexa]] rank for over a year with some short term spikes in use, but not unique users. But still, a very insignificant site (#24,134 21-Feb-2008) managed to overtake another insignificant site ([[Scientology|RichardDawkins.net]] - #23,882), and keep a higher average for thirty-one days. As of March 23rd, 2008 they are back to being [[Luser|second rate douche bags]].

==RRS e-mail posted - Sapient acts irrationally, goes apeshit, calls police==

Brian Sapient, in an act of true rationality, phoned the Borough of Hatboro, PA  police 28 Feb 2008 (215-675-2832) department when a user reposted a private e-mail and claimed harassment and copyright violations. Officer Valloway phoned at 2:17am about some “website postings”.[http://www.rantsnraves.org/showthread.php?t=7740&page=9]

What the |friendly neighborhood pan troglodytic boobs don't seem to understand is:

<li>E-mails are not copyrightable, unless they are a "creative work"
<li>If this was copyrightable, then quoting it for critical review meets fair use guidelines
<li>If this was a copyright violation, it would be a civil matter, not a criminal one
<li>The e-mail in question is threatening a person to cease and desist under the threat of further personal harassment.  
</ol>
Other than showing a lack of understanding of basic grammar and copyright law, Sapient shows us once again that the Rational Response Squad is about as interested in free speech as the Church of Scientology.

==Greydon Square squarely punches Sapient in face==
[[Image:BrianSapient shiner.jpg|thumb|240px|For Darwin! :(]]

The [http://teapotatheism.blogspot.com/2008/06/aha-conference-wrap-up.html blog Tea Pot Atheist reports] that in an epic moment of bi-polar bear power-lulz, Greydon Square AKA the self-proclaimed "black [[Carl Sagan]]"[http://www.flickr.com/photos/rationalresponsesquad/1707055735/] punched Brian Sapient in the face many times.

It seems the heart of this dispute is over CD sales. Brian Sapient saw a chance to make a 1000% profit and gain music rights to his videos, but would take people's money and not give them a product.  Further, the price of his album at "$11.99 via physical distribution on his homepage"[http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=33326] but without his knowledge or consent upped the price to $15, making Greydon Square look like a fraud.

On top of this, Brian Sapient took money as an agent of Greydon Square, guaranteed shipping in seven days[http://www.greydonsquare.com/], kept the money and shipped nothing, making it look like a poor attempt at wire and postal fraud. An unpaid flunky was blamed. When asked to stop sales of the CD until this dispute was resolved by a neutral arbitrator, Sapient refused claiming ownership over Greydon Square's copyrighted work and had yet to make back his investment. It was at this point Greydon Square punched Brian Sapient in the face.

Kelly's Tits were reported as saying, "it was a violent savage animalistic assault by a low-life thug who put shame on the atheist community." She also wonders why Brian Sapient isn't getting any sympathy, and can't understand why anyone would be upset by seemingly valid accusations of embezzlement, wire fraud, mail fraud, and price fraud or someone attempting to exercise their copyright. She is also reported to have [[Boob job|large titz]]. A table was also toppled in this exchange.  

[[Image:Greydon_square_punch_in_the_face.jpg|thumb|240px|Greydon Square takes shit from no one, if you don't get your CD, he gets angry. Operators are standing by[http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=265696571&s=143441], some proceeds used to keep the lead singer out of jail.]]

While many douche bags would like to ban Greydon Square from future conferences, he will still perform at The Atheist Experience[http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=115979] June 20th 2008.  Learn about how the belief in God is not logical, and how it's more logical to spend your life obsessed over the lack of belief in something. Brian Sapient was unavailable for comment whether he'll face the "Black [[Carl Sagan]]" in the ring again.  

<strike>We here at Encyclopedia Dramatica would like to say we are sorry for the altercation. Brian Sapient generates much lulz. Get well soon you stupid self-aggrandizing son-of-a-bitch so we can laugh at you.</strike> [[Disregard that|HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]] ...But seriously, we hope you've developed a few more [[insane|neuroses]] and [[goatse|mental scars]] from your [[LOL|ordeal]], you retarded asshat.

==Rook Hawkins' legal threats - "Sopoena" Google for the IP addresses==
[[Image:RRS-Transgender-Rook.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Poser|Rook  Hawkins]] and books]]
Do you remember being a child in a school yard?  You were [[butthurt]] over dropping your lollipop and proudly shouted, "I'm going to sue your mom."  Do you remember growing out of that phase?  [[Poser|Rook  Hawkins]] doesn't. Recently on Rantsnraves.org there is a thread spoofing Rook[http://www.rantsnraves.org/showthread.php?t=12197]. Rook took some tips from Sapient's book How To Threaten Lawsuits and Get Your Way, and e-mailed the administrator. Rook claims some experience: "I'm sure you are aware that if this goes were not to be handled appropriately, and I took this to court and had to sopoena [''sic''] Google for the IP addresses (and discovered that they were different)."[http://www.rantsnraves.org/showthread.php?p=380548#post380548]. A vote was taken to address the seriousness of Rooks "legal" claim[http://www.rantsnraves.org/showthread.php?p=382242]. Presently 92.86% vote to call Rook's bluff, about the percent of lawyers to users on Rantsnraves. Brian Sapient[http://www.rantsnraves.org/member.php?u=2815] and Matt Shizzle[http://www.rantsnraves.org/member.php?u=2816] have been spoofed.  

It's reported that the posters are behind seven proxies and it would take lots of luck and a Google Sopoena [''sic''] to catch them. Also while lawyers as a rule can't spell subpoena, an "expert" in mythology who can't spell subpoena[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poena] is an epic fail.

==Rook Hawkins speaks to NYC Atheists - described as "scholarly"==
[[Image:NYCA_we_protect_you_from_crap.jpg|thumb|175px|If it smells like a church, takes donations like a church...]]
[[Image:NYCA_we_protect_you_from_Vatican_mercenaries.jpg|thumb|175px|<s>IT'S A FUCKING CHURCH!</s> It's [[Photoshop|Shooped]].]]
[[Poser|Rook  Hawkins]] is the Squad's resident expert on "Ancient texts" and biblical shit was invited to speak to [http://nyc-atheists.org/| NYC-Atheists], a small fringe [[atheist]] [[cult]] known to frequent Kennedy's Irish Restaurant.  Their press agent, Jane Everhart, overly excited about a boy over half her age didn't bother to check Rook's credentials as she knew he was a work in progress.  She made the following claims
# Rook Hawkins was a self-taught expert on the Bible, a public historian[http://www.publichistory.org/what_is/definition.html], and bible specialist[http://www.acsi.org/webfiles/webitems/attachments/002410_Bible%20Chart.pdf].  
# Translated the ENTIRE bible from Greek.  
# and was invited to publish academic series.  
Jane Everhart is a independent journalist, freelance editor[http://www.ofallon.com/rosemary/h-awrd.shtml], and prolific spammer of private listservs[http://groups.google.com/group/swiny-talk/browse_thread/thread/fc3a9dd40f2bad1c/59e894a906f57186#59e894a906f57186]  who can't grasp that a press release is for the press and shouldn't be large enough to choke a horse and be sent to every e-mail she runs across. [[Poser|Rook  Hawkins]] might not even be a high-school graduate, is totally unpublished, and writes on the 10th grade level.  But Jane, lacking in any journalistic integrity, spammed the world with her mammoth 96 line press release with laudable claims that don't pass the sniff test. She claims to be totally inundated by 6 e-mails from two people over a week informing her that Rook is a fraud.  

[[Image:NYCatheists-JaneEverhart.jpg|left]]

So no atheist would ever dispute an unpublished uncredentialed douche bag that claims he can prove there was no Jesus, constructed a [[Conspiracy|conspiracy theory]] where people are paid by the Vatican to discredit a person's thesis that can be summed up like this, "The bible is crap, so there was no Jesus, 'cause there is no reason to believe there was".  One critic perpetrated some epic lulz by faxing the restaurant Rook was speaking at[http://a.nnotate.com/php/pdfnotate.php?d=2008-08-12&c=YzoKxERs#page1] [http://a.nnotate.com/php/pdfnotate.php?d=2008-08-12&c=8N5tOz7j#page1] which resulted in a huge panic attack by Jane.  It's reported she was looking under the tables for Vatican Commandos while they spent an hour figuring out the sound system.  
One attendee Roy Pertchik felt, "somewhat abused by the talk; assailed[http://atheists.meetup.com/24/messages/boards/thread/5222548#20172774]" which is no surprise as Rook mumbled quickly a bunch of foreign sounding names for an hour to establish the bible is crap.  Positive reviews describe him as being "very scholarly" but when asked what Rook talked about, they had no fucking clue but it sure sounded scholarly.  
[[Image:2008-08-13_Rook_on_lecture.jpg|thumb|500px|left|Moar Rook role-playing]]

Rook's detractors [http://www.rantsnraves.org/showthread.php?t=8250][http://richarddawkins.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=38435] were never hiding, they are most public in two threads with over 1,800 replies.  His position has been thoroughly debunked by TeamFFI[http://members.shaw.ca/TeamFFI/][http://www.rationalresponders.com/forum/14157] among others. Only one person bothered to bring up the debate, suggesting there is no reason to believe there was no Jesus just because the bible is crap, to which Rook responded "there is no reason to think he did".  Rook feels pretty good as he's the sort of boy who gets validation by getting negative attention.
Jane Everhart gets her validation by doing stupid shit and blaming criticism on evil fanatic Christians when ALL THE CRITICS WERE WELL KNOWN ATHEISTS.

<br><br>

===Why NYC Atheists is a stupid pseudo-cult===
[[Image:2008-08-13_Jane_on_censorship.jpg|center]]
[[Image:NYCatheism-Jane_Everhart-delusional.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Jane Everhart believes Rook is followed by Vatican mercenaries]]

This was after pages of comments were deleted, but her distaste of censorship continued for exactly 16 hours where every comment critical of Rook declaring him self an expert or Jane fraudulently promoting Rook as, among other things, the guy who translated the bible from Greek by age 25, where deleted but printed to PDFs by a critic.[http://igepanda.blogspot.com/2008/08/nyc-atheists-censored-forum-messages.html]. 

[[Image:NYCatheism-Jane_Everhart--delusional2.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Here are Jane's imaginary mercenaries, off to invade the blogsphere just to discredit Rook.]]

So the bottom line:
# Jane uncritically accepted Rook's claims and blew up his profile;
# She refused to listen to valid queries about how she was presenting him;
# Displayed extreme paranoia about Rook's critics, even accepting his lie that we were theists;
# Exaggerated about the number of people critical of their advert, and their motivation 
# Made vicious allegations regarding child-molestation;
# Lied about harassment;
# Cried Vatican Conspiracy and the group subsequently edited/deleted and banned contributions and contributors to the debate[http://richarddawkins.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=38435&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&start=725#p1208192].
This begs the question, if we have a fanatical believer becoming a fanatical nonbeliever, what the fuck is the difference.  
In short, NYC Atheists is commanded by megalomaniacal demagogues who claim to embrace reason, but use emotion to guide people to their ultimate purpose, a world free of Christians.  The only difference is religion is better organized.
As a result of this epic lulz NYC Atheists is now #2 on Rant n' Raves cult watch list.  

===Why Rook Hawkins' position is crap===
The bible isn't just crap, it's built on crap, built from crap. Over centuries there were many people on soap boxes spewing crap. Someone wrote down this crap, and in the fourth century someone assembled the biggest pile of crap in history. In order for Rook's position to work, the bible must be designed for a purpose, not just a bunch of random crap. Bottom line - anyone who uses crap to prove the existence of someone who spewed crap, you get crap. Once you accept the bible is crap, you can move on, unless your a narcissistic douche bag with something to prove.

Tell people about how [[prostitute|I]] had a [[hangover|nervous breakdown]] last year after being [[pr0n|drugged and raped]], then had an [[abortion]], then had you threatening to leave from that very day (so sensitive), and stopped writing because I went to [[Ted Haggard|rehab for 45 days]]. Then tell them how you won't let me come [[cult compound|home]] even though my insurance can't get me into what YOU consider [[rape|appropriate treatment]]--and FUCK what I think or feel about it.
<br /><br />
I hope you meet your [[16-year-old girl|next girlfriend]] on fucking Facebook, take her home, and then realize why [[crackwhore|men pay to fuck me]]. And then [[Skeezer|she'll]] leave you, too, because we all have daddies, and if we wanted to live with them, we would.
<br /><br />
[[Fuck My Life|THAT IS TRUTH]]. And I'm sorry it came to that. The Kellym78 accounts on RRS, MySpace, and Facebook have all been permanently deleted, and fuck if I didn't wish I could delete it from my brain as well.
<br /><br />
Keep on coming back to KaseyGrant.com--your never-ending source of drama. I'm not even drunk-posting this time.

In summation, Brian Sapient could not sexually satisfy Kelly, so there was no point financially supporting him. Kelly is now back on the market to the delight of [[Matt Shizzle]]. And it is only a matter of time now before both Brian Sapient and Kelly become [[Christfags]] once again.

==How to troll==
A great way to troll the RRS is to post in the (freethinkersonly) forum on their website and call them totalitarian retards. Rook will quickly slap a "theist" label on your user name and make it impossible for you to post a new topic. Proceed to fifty [[Hitler]] or [[Goatse]] reply as many topics as possible before they ban you. Lulz will most definitely ensue. Make sure to get screenshots and call them a bunch of "fundies" for extra points.

==Notable quotes==
{{quote|Don't you just love the internet? Just two minutes on Google and I found this. You're a shitstain Brian, you are a God damned liar, and a dangerous demagogue. I can't wait until the rest of the people who are deluded enough to consider themselves followers wake the fuck up and smell the fucking coffee. And realise what a pathetic piece of shit you are.|Chaotheist}}

{{quote|I love that you mention theism as being an unhealthy preoccupation... what do you spend all your time doing, Sapient?|[[Fakesagan]]}}

{{quote|I really hate the RRS, this was like watching Otto the bus driver and Courtney Love debate Ned Flanders and well Kirk Cameron. Not exactly a showcase of intellectual prowess.|Regarding Nightline's Dumber Than a Fifth Grader debate between the RRS vs. [[The Way of the Master|Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron]]}}

{{quote|The RRS is an embarrassment to me as an atheist. I cringe to think people will watch and lump me in with those two or their feckless little group, and I have to strongly agree with so many others about Kelly. Kelly's shrill condescending child-voice makes me want to skewer my own eardrums with a bayonet.|[[Barack Obama]]}}

{{quote|I'd rather watch my stand-up specials while being spoon-fed boiling water, standing naked strapped to a big gay man's leather crotchless chaps, all the while being told I'm a pretty little puppy, before I'd ever watch one of their tube videos again. Oh, and Kelly was never that hawt. I'm just saying...|[[Jeff Foxworthy]]}}

{{quote|I do not approve. |[[Chuck Norris]]}}
