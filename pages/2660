'''Encyclopædia Dramatica''' is a central catalog for organized reference pages about [[drama]], [[meme]]s, [[e-pal]]s and other interesting happenings on the [[internets]]. ED is also the [[Final Solution|final]] arbiter of [[truth]] and human destiny, and can be used to settle any dispute, anywhere, [[evar]]. 

==Origins==

{{squote|'''That isn't [[Wikipedia]], but the Encyclopedia Dramatica. It's that infamous site that's been made by [[goatse|a**holes]] <!-- asterisks in original post --> who got kicked out of editing at [[Wikipedia]] so they made their own Wiki where standards of good taste, common [[pussy|decency]], and the avoidance of [[NSFW]] pictures do not exist. They made pages for about a gazillion people whom they deem [[fail|unfit to live]], including myself.'''|[[Daveykins|David Gonterman]]|on Encyclopedia Dramatica[http://comments.deviantart.com/4/1063802/616257331]}}

Encyclopædia Dramatica was created on December 9th, 2004, while [[girlvinyl]] was impatiently awaiting the delivery of her [[P-p-p-powerbook|ibook]]. [[ghettofinger]] and [[girlvinyl]] were outraged and amused by the ill-treatment of [[internet celebrity]] [[jameth]] by the moderators and idiots at [[Wikipedia]], and [[girlvinyl]] decided it was time to present an alternative to the fascist hold they had over information on the internets. 

The site's title was coined by [[user:33mhz|33mhz]] on [[jameth]]'s [http://www.jameth.us journal]. On the inaugural install and first operational night of ED, [[scarlet]] and [[jeremyjx]] were added as [[Special:Listadmins|moderators]], with others following. Once the site was posted on [[LNN]], its audience and content grew exponentially.

Like all [[website]]s with user-generated content, ED quickly degenerated into a forum for [[unfunny]] revenge attempts by [[butthurt]] individuals of every description -- bigots, [[ban]]ned website users, [[lolcow|trolling victims]], failed [[troll]]s, and [[virgin]]s rejected by hot girls. [[99.9%]] of all ED articles are [[tl;dr]] ravings about things the person dislikes, or unknown and uninteresting [[LiveJournal]] or [[deviantART]] users who made someone mad by existing. The other .1% are archives of dead [[YouTube]] embeds.

All users are welcomed to create and modify content to more accurately reflect the internets and help archive the never ending supply of e-drama. Please continue to add articles so that the encyclopedia will provide answers to questions like "What the hell is [[mediacrat]]?" and "Where are the [[lulz]]?"

Not to be confused with [[Dramapedia]], silly [[Not4chan|pedophiles]].

== What's with the '''æ''' ? ==
[[Image:Aelogo_black_on_blue.png|frame|right|A very good character]]

The proper spelling of Encyclopædia Dramatica includes the little '''æ'''; however, those characters are not allowed to be registered in domain names, so we used the mundane spelling. Feel free to use alt+145, alt+0230, or alt+z (option+' on OS X) if you'd like to experience it. As '''æ''' is confusing and mysterious like ED itself, it became the mascot for the site. æ is also a normal character in the Danish, [[France|French]], and Norwegian alphabets.

==Is ED racist/homophobic?==
No it is not. While there is a lot of material on ED that many find upsetting, the admins come from a variety of backgrounds, races and sexualities. These people all understand [[satire]] and [[lulz]], even when the minority group they are a part of is targeted, they know it was not a serious attack on them.  

If you are part of a minority group and are [[offended]] by ED take note from [[PCBIZNUSS]] in the below video and try to understand we stand for [[free speech]] however threatened you may feel by that. After all, without [[free speech]], no minority group would have ever received rights to begin with.
