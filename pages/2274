'''Dinosaurs''' have a lot more internet relevance than it seems, as they are involved with the two largest bases of [[fucktards]] on the [[internet]] - [[creationists]] and [[furries]]. Also occasionally known as "Drama-saurs", any mention of dinosaurs, accurate or inaccurate, will cause a shitstorm of drama by people who spend far too much time on the internet.

Dinosaurs are the official best thing ever.

==Unpopular Science==

[[Image:Jesus on dinosaur.jpg|thumb|right|This was taken from the [[Conservapedia]]'s first article on dinosaurs.]]

Mentioning dinosaurs is a sure-fire way to get a rise from any [[creationist]] who will claim either:

* Dinosaurs existed for thousands, not millions of years.
* The word "Dragon" in the Bible actually means "Dinosaur", which means dinosaurs and humans lived at the same time.
* Dinosaurs did not exist. Ever. They are [[Richard Dawkins|hoaxes made up be evil scientists who want to destroy religion]]. 
* Others think that dinosaur fossils are actually the bones of [[dragon|dragons]], re-arranged by [[Satan]] and his [[atheist|minions]] to make Christians doubt the [[Bible]].
* Dinosaur bones were put by [[God]] just for a couple [[lulz]].

It should be noted however that not all [[head|faith-heads]] automatically reject the idea of dinosaurs, as is the case of [[Raptor Jesus]], who is worshiped by millions.

===[[Evolution]]===

[[Image:Niggersaurus.JPG|thumb|left|[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/12/bizarre-dinosaurs/nigersaurus-text Not quite a joke.]]]

[[Image:Nigger back of bus.jpg|thumb|left|Dinos sit up front. black persons in back.]]

Most dinosaurs became either reptiles or birds. This is what most people think. As it turns out dinosaurs are even more distantly related from humans than previously thought.

Before they evolved into apes, [[niggers]] were originally dinosaurs. Specialized bones - noticeably the enormous lips - were found in [[Africa]]. Scientists refer to it as a giant lawnmower. It's diet is unknown, [[Watermelonz|although judging by it's descendants it's an easy guess]].

The idea that humans are directly descended from dinosaurs should not be confused with [[Reptoids]], which are lizards which came from outer space and take on the form of humans in order to take over the world. Strangely, the humans they chose to resemble are usually [[white people]], not [[niggers]].

===How the Dinosaurs Became [[an hero|Extinct]]===

[[Image:Orlysaurus.jpg|thumb|[[O RLY?]]]] 
[[Image:Fuck-you-dinosaurs.png|thumb]]

[[Some argue|Most scientists believe]] a giant meteorite caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, blocking out the sun, causing the next ice age, and ultimately killing all the cold-blooded animals. Others believe it was an ancient form of [[global warming]]. [[Retard|Some]] think it was [[God]].

How the dinosaurs became extinct has been debated by scientists for years. [[Shit nobody cares about|Few other people care.]]

==[[Furries|Scalies]]==

[[Image:Paw attack.jpg|thumb|We only need one picture of furry art on this page, thank you very much.]]

Scalies are [[furries]] who have [[fursona|fursonas]] of reptiles instead of cute fuzzy animals. They are fiercely defensive of their names, as they have [[shit nobody cares about|''scales'', not fur]]. Such insignificant details should not be noted, as [[truth|they are all still scumbags]] and no closer to [[Raptor Jesus]] than other furries.

Favorite sexual deviancy among scalies include egg-shitting in a permanent orgasmic state akin to [[shit]] art and wrapping their forked tongues around throbbing lizard [[cock]]. Many lizards and reptiles however do not have cocks but a single hole known as a cloaca - where [[shit]], [[urine]] and [[cum]] all squirt out, which probably enhances the flavor.

Most scalies are either dinosaurs or [[FYIAD|dragons]]. The dinosaur of choice is always a raptor. Not a ''Stegosaurus'' with a brain the size of a walnut or a hideous egg-eater. It's always a raptor. This serves only as further [[Raptor Jesus|blasphemy]]. The reason behind always choosing a raptor is that scalies also have a [[pawfur]], [[vore]], and [[guro]] [[fetish]] and enjoy ripping their partners apart with their feet and eating them.

Actually, since [[YOU'RE A BIRD!|birds are said to be the dinosaurs' closest living relatives]], the dino-furries should be classified amongst ANOTHER subgroup: the "[[Furry|featheries]]".

==Spinosaurus & Gianotosaurus==

One of the lesser known internet relevances Dinosaurs have. Two of the most [[gay|infamous]] dinosaurs of OUR time. Thay have been know to cause massive ammounts of [[BAWWWWWW|bawwing]] and [[drama|drama]]. How is this possible? With the [[faggotry|powers]] of JurASSic Park and [[Shit nobody cares about|Dino Crisis 2]]. Most of this drama can actually turn into fucking flamewars.
Most of the drama happens on [[Typical|Youtube]].

Trust me, go onto any video about Jurassic Park or Dino Crisis 2, you'll find someone bitching.

Why are all the fags whining?

Apparently, all of this is genereated from the [[lie|fact]] that Spinosaurus/Giganotosaurus can [[rape|kill]] T. Rex in a fight.

Of course, most of these [[newfags|intellectual people]] don't realize they're a bunch of retards.


'''Here are some facts help you be [[moar|moar]] smart:'''

*[[OM NOM NOM NOM|T. Rex had a bite force of 4 tons.]]

*T. Rex had teeth the size of [[cocks|bananas.]]

*[[TyrannosaurusRex|T. Rex]] was better than [[you|you.]]



So, if you see anyone say "spino culd pwn T _Rex asS", they're most likely a a newfag, and you should begin the [[troll|obvious.]]

==[[forced meme|Philosoraptor]]==

===Central tenet===

Philosoraptor's Theory of Dinosaurs asserts that non-material abstract (but substantial) forms (or ideas) ([[Creationism]]), and not the material world of change known to us through [[Scientology]], possess the [[drugs|highest and most fundamental kind of reality]].  Or in [[retard|layman's]] terms - did [[dinosaurs]] eat [[Baby Jesus]]? <br>

{{quote|There are still many mysteries surrounding dinosaurs. We know that they're extinct (duh), and we know that they could be vicious carnivores and hippie-esque herbivores. But we still don't know for sure what they looked like and we definitely don't know if they ever had any deep thoughts. I mean, it's not likely that they pondered existence, but it's a nice idea, no?}}
