'''Ardi Rizal''' is a two year old [[Indonesia]]n boy who achieved small fame in both [[IRL|real life]] and on the [[internets]] when videos and pictures of him smoking surfaced. Since then, it has been discovered that the boy begun smoking at the ripe old age of eighteen months and has progressively developed a healthy forty-a-day habit.This along with his grotesque size of 25Kg gave doctors cause for concern, sort of. The Indonesian health department, which in itself is an oxymoron, has offered Ardi's genius parents a token PR bribe; if Ardi stops, they will buy them a brand new car. No word yet on if they have taken them up on the offer, but [[some argue|some believe]] Mr and Mrs Rizal should hold out for a [[profit|much larger offer]]. 


==BREAKING NEWS==

Ardi spent July, [[2010]] in [[rehab]] and has returned a non-smoker.
No news on the tuk-tuk car.
