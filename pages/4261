'''Jeffree Moon''' is a self professed "JStarling" and [[tranny]] [[faggot]] who [[trying too hard|tried too hard]] to be [[Jeffree Star]].  

After almost becoming  [[an hero]] because of its chronic [[emo|depression]], Jeffree Moon found [[Jesus|hope]] in Jeffree Star's [[shit|music]]. While it may seem to be a [[typical]] [[internets]] tranny [[whore]], Jeffree Moon is on a [[Epic fail|quest]] to have [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]'s article on Jeffree Star removed.

JMoon's sole purpose in life is to do anything humanly possible to stop "JSTAR-persecution". In other words, JMoon will scour [[Jeffree Star|JStar's]] page by constantly refreshing for a chance of even the slightest derogatory comment popping up.  

Jmoon will stop at nothing to  seek "retribution"; pretty much Jmoon will just constantly whine "your jus jelouz of jstar, cauze he so Kawaii" hoping that the attacker will find themselves so overcome with guilt that they [[An hero|kill themselves.]] 

After, Jmoon celebrates by bragging about [[Holocaust|"Making the world a better place,]] one  STAR hater at a time." When, really, most people don't even give two shits about the fugly man-whore until they can't stand to hear anymore about how 16-year-old-girls wish they were as [[Lie|original and pretty as he is.]] 

Typically their blog entries are only read by about ten people. Anyone with enough time on their hands to do something like this needs to find a better hobby than defending an egotistical, holier-than-thou make-up laden tranny.

Jmoon seems to have an obsession with "pwning" people, But only ends up looking like a <s>spacker that's loose in a library reading books out loud like this "DER WOZ UNC A FARRRGOORRRRTTTTTTTTT CALLED JHEFFARYYYYYY TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR WHOOO GORTTTTT BUMMMEDDD BY A UNEYECHORN!", Spastic twat.</s> fucking retard.

==Darfur==

In a feeble attempt to justify their existence, JMoon is trying to encourage Jeffree to help all the depraved and dying people in Darfur. Jeffree, however, will never express any interest in this movement unless it involves the grinding up of refugee's corpses to make more makeup for him. Their touching letter to him that he ignored because he's too busy clubbin' in LA with artfags is as follows:

{{quote|<I>Dear Jeffree,

We all know what a wonderful caring person you are. Always there standing up for somebody who isn't perfect. People picked on, thrown out of society, on the verge of suicide. And your always there. Either with a cheerful song to pick up the day, a bulletin to get our minds off, or for the luckyest of us a comment to make our day.

[[No|Just one of these three simple things can do just that to save the dieing of darfur.]] Either with a song, a bulletin, a blog........ even a comment to one person could help the youth get aware at whats happening.

I always remember hearing other fans say , "Jeffree told me i only have one life, and i should be and do whatever i want and not waste it"

Jeffree these poor people do in fact have only one life. Sadly all of them will never live it. Never becoming the true person they were born to be. Think of all the future artists, musicians, teachers, doctors, lawyers etc. lost before they could give their gift to the world; as you have given us all. Time and Time again...</i>|JMoon, whining}}

The letter than goes into a shameful poem that utilizes basic HTML to look more artsy. And you thought it couldn't get any worse.

==Scarlet==

[[Image:JMoon_dead.png|thumb|'If you can bear to look at the CSS filter long enough, you can see JMoon's member who died of AIDS.']]
JMoon recently lost one of their friends after a long battle with [[AIDS]], and his death alone now justifies their existence, as they state in this quote:

{{quote|"But the most important reason we keep running this profile, isn't for fame or anything. IT IS FOR OUR DEAD FRIEND SCARLETT. Who happened to be a big fan of jstar, but sadly never got to meet him. He also was an [[Asspie|aspir]]ing keyboardist, who sadly never got to record more than the songs available here. So we hope you will appreciate this profile for what it is, a way to keep our dear friend SCARLETT's dream alive..."|JMoon, mourning Scarlet}}

==[[OH SHI-]], [[MOAR]][[oneoneone|!!11]]==

[[Image:jmoon2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guess the Gender]]!]]

Jeffree Moon tries to make shitty [[punk]] music after its [[hero]] Jeffree Star. Music so shameful, so hideous to human ears that [[Rickroll|Rick Astley]] and [[Chocolate Rain|Tay Zonday]] become [[No|appealing.]] Quite possibly the most disturbing music available on MySpace.  Once again following in the foot steps of his lord and savior, Moon [[fail]]s it. 

Like any [[MySpace]] [[friendwhore]], Moon's attempts at [[shameless self promotion]] earned it only around [[at least 100]] [[moar]] [[fag|friends]]. Moon, due to its [[retard]]ation, did not notice. Moon continued writing shitty [[poetry|lyrics]] about nearly becoming an hero:

{{quote|I want to be your star

I used hate myself
until i found you
I used to hate myself
until i found you

Jeffreeeeeeeeeeeee staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar

I want to be your star
I want to be your star}}

==Jeffree Moon and the [[Lulz]]==

Jeffree Moon hates [[lulz]]. Its MySpace profile says this:

{{quote|I am Jeffree Moon, champion of [[fail|justice]]! On behalf of JSTAR, I will [[suicide|right wrongs]] and [[die|triumph over evil]], and that means [[you]]! BRING ON THE [[LULZ]]....GET READY TO BE [[pwn|PWN]]ED!|Jmoon blog}}

What this [[faggot]] fails to understand is that it [[self pwn|pwns itself]] on a daily basis and has done so since [[last Thursday]]. However, whenever an [[asshole|aspiring troll]] came in contact with it, they were [[banned]] by the [[Mission: MySpace|MySpace police]], and Moon remains  an arrogant [[fag]]got.

==Jeffree Moon and Encyclopedia Dramatica==

[[Image:jmoonfail.jpg|thumb|right|Jeffree Moon fails at vandalizing ED.]]

What Moon haets [[moar]] than the [[lulz]] is Encyclopedia Dramatica, an [[awesome]] website that makes the [[lulz]] accessible in [[win|an easy-to-read, educational format]].

Moon's MySpace profile discusses how to [[vandal|vandalize]] Encyclopedia Dramatica's Jeffree Star article. However, Moon [[fail]]s it yet again because it only takes a couple clicks to revert an [[article]]. Here's the actual text:

{{quote|J-STARlings unite! End the JSTAR_Persecution fight! BRING DOWN ENCYCLOPEDIA DRAMATICA!!! EVERYONE create an account and REMOVE their jstar page!(if you don't know how, we have a step by step guide w/ PICTURES in a blog)|JMoooooo}}

Moon says its journey as that "[[cosplay|character]]" has [[an hero|ended]], but [[some argue]] that it will return as soon as it sees this article.

==Moon's Blog==

[[Image:jmoon3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Emo]] loev.]]

This is where this [[lol-cow]] is able to be milked the most. Below are some quotes from Moon's blogs.

{{quote|[[LOL]], I've seen allot of [[troll]]s... BUT NEVER such a desperate [[attention whore|ATTENTION whore]] such as yourself.... OK I'd understand if you we're a bunch of [[asspie|involuntary virgins]] who gang together, to bitch about jstar..... BUT ITS SO OBVIOUS

and to think u befriend jstar; just to [[cock|PUBIC]] ALLY ''(awkward typo)'' [[troll|BASH HIM]]?! so sad...

Honey read this.....
[[Jeffree_Star|http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Jeffree_Star]]

get some [[PROTIP|good tips]] to make up for your lack of [[pwn|PWN]]age

and yes as some1 pointed out... [[You're/Your|your]] not [[azn|asian]]... [[You're/Your|YOUR]] [[Wapanese|WAPANESE]].... the lamest of all races! some1 who wishes to be [[japan]]ese SOO much they only list [[hentai|anime and manga]] on their myspace interests.... then list themselves as [[azn|asian]]...|JMoo}}

[[Oh noes]]... an [[internet tough guy]]! Oh wait... it isn't a guy.

==Good News==

Jeffree Moon claims its [[fail|career]] is over after making one shitty CD.

{{quote|As things stand, We believe this will be our last album for sometime, and defiantly the last jmoon album to appear on myspace. Considering JMOON [[suicide|dies]] at the end of the album and fades away. 

Putting up our own new songs would just be [[oh exploitable|exploiting]] jstars [[friendwhore|fame]] for our own. Which is something we are dead set against.(The last song up is simply an ode to a deceased friend)

we plan to branch out with our producer viking quest, for future releases which will be held on different websites, which we will post links to in time. THE JMOON character, has served his purpose as the metaphor we so desired... JMOON is now gone, and finished...|JMooooo}}

Translation: Is it can be [[an hero]] tiem now plz??

The profile supposedly remains active because Moon's friend Scarlett ([[allegedly]] male) became [[an hero]], so Moon keeps it up in Scarlett's memory, not to be an [[attention whore]]. However, the profile's headline, ""BIGGEST JSTARfanclub! OFFICIALLY 2k starlings strong!"" suggests [[lie|otherwise]].

==HOLY FUCKING SHIT! BREAKING NEWS MOTHERFUCKERS!==
The [[fag|faggot]] band are back, And possibly making a new song, best get to trolling these fucking tranny ass raiders. Piss taking of said dead friend wins one free internet.
