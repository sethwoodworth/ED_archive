G20 Toronto Lollercaust
{{tinyquote|1=The French G8/G20, even though I can’t confirm the Canadian numbers, they will cost 10 times less when it is France's turn.

The G20 conference in Toronto is a [[Jew Gold|C$]]1.2 Billion false flag operation by the international [[zionist]] bankers to turn the [[lie|tolerant and harmoneous]] city of Toronto into a police state full of cameras and jack booted paramiltary staff. 

==G20 summit means more [[Jew Gold]] for the Global elite==
[[Image:G20riotforidiots.jpg|left|frame|The peaceful "protesters"]]
Twice a year, leaders of the 20 richest countries meet to try to come up with ways to make their citizens work longer hours and spend moar. June 26-27 it was [[Canada]]'s turn. Rather than do the sensible thing and hold the summit at a military base, IRL Troll Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper decided to hold it in Canada's biggest busiest city, Toronto. Toronto is a city that never votes for Harper's Government. By holding it in Toronto, Harper not only ensured maximum lulz at the difficulty Torontonians will have getting to work during in the days leading to the summit, he also had the pretext he needed to permanently turn Toronto into a jack booted [[Nazi]] statelet.

==Integrated Gestapo Unit==

[[File:Toronto Security Fence.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Anyone 5m from the fence can be arrested without a warrant, lol jk we were making it up]]
A paramilitary unit called in [[Nazi|Integrated Security Unit]] (ISU) was formed in Toronto consisting of people who liek wearing uniforms. These uniformed trolls outnumbered the protesters 50 to 1. Their job is to [[vanned|van]] anyone looking suspicious. A security fence was [[penis|erected]] encompassing far more area than was needed. Cameras were placed all around city streets to keep an eye on [[you]]. These cameras and the heightened security will remain in Toronto permanently. False flag operations were enacted by the ISU dressed as rioters where they set fire to police cars and smashed the windows of various banks and businesses in the downtown core. In addition to generating plenty of lulz, these false flag operations generate nice photo ops and gave the ISU the justification it needed to conduct mass arrests and raep.

==Lake Waistamahtaxes==
[[File:Fake-lake-g20.jpg|thumb|left|200px|$1.2 Million fake lake for G20]]
In addition to money in the pockets of Harper's cronies, a nice fence in the middle of the city, and cameras to permanently keep watch, the 1.2 Billion also bought Torontonians a $1.2 million dollar fake lake, affectionately referred to by Canadians as Lake Waistamahtaxes. This lake was constructed to give the G20 delegates who couldn't attend the G8 conference in Hunstville, the [[shit|charm]] of a Northern Ontario town.

==ISU derives lulz by tormenting cripples==
[[file:John_pruyn.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Police [[did it for the lulz|tore off his artificial limb]] and told him to hop]]
In addition to considering underaged lolis a threat and rounding them up for detention and finger banging, the ISU also considers cripple people a threat. Consider the [http://niagaraatlarge.com/2010/07/05/thorold-ontario-amputee-has-his-artificial-leg-ripped-off-by-police-and-is-slammed-in-makeshift-cell-during-g20-summit-%E2%80%93-at-least-one-ontario-mpp-calls-the-whole-episode-%E2%80%9Cshocking/ story] of one John Pruyn, employee with Revenue Canada whom police [[lolwtf|tore off his artificial limb and told him to hop]]:

{{bigtext|{{Align|left|
The 57-year-old Thorold, Ontario resident – an employee with Revenue Canada and a part-time farmer who lost a leg above his knee following a farming accident 17 years ago – was sitting on the grass at Queen’s Park with his daughter Sarah and two other young people this June 26, during the G20 summit, where he assumed it would be safe.

As it turned out, it was a bad assumption because in came a line of armoured police, into  an area the city had promised would be safe for peaceful demonstrations during the summit. They closed right in on John and his daughter and the two others and ordered them to move. Pruyn tried getting up and he fell, and it was all too slow for the police.

As Sarah began pleading with them to give her father a little time and space to get up because he is an amputee, they began kicking and hitting him. One of the police officers used his knee to press Pruyn’s head down so hard on the ground, said Pruyn in an interview this July 4 with Niagara At Large, that his head was still hurting a week later.

Accusing him of resisting arrest, they pulled his walking sticks away from him, tied his hands behind his back and ripped off his prosthetic leg. Then they told him to get up and hop, and when he said he couldn’t, they dragged him across the pavement, tearing skin off his elbows , with his hands still tied behind his back. His glasses were knocked off as they continued to accuse him of resisting arrest and of being a “spitter,” something he said he did not do. They took him to a warehouse and locked him in a steel-mesh cage where his nightmare continued for another 27 hours.}}|700|200}}

==Valiant Protesters==
The protesters fell into 4 distinct camps:

'''Whiners''': The usual suspects included native indians angry about "stolen" land, residential schools or shitty reserves, conveniently forgetting about the billions of dollars that disappears into the black hole that is the reserve system each year. Other whiners include labour unions lead by [[Irish|Sid Ryan]] who were going off about [[Shit nobody cares about| evil capitalism, banks and themselves]].

'''Tourists''': "Hey duuude, let's go check out all that G20 riotzz, bro!" Perhaps the [[fag]]giest of the bunch. These guys wanted to come down and see what all the hubbub was about. They can be seen taking pictures in front of burning cars, gathering around news cameras, holding useless dance parties in front of police and generally being douches.

'''Anarchists''': Not so much anarchists as middle class white kids mostly from Queerbec. They enjoy smashing windows, causing trouble and costing the taxpayers a billions dollars. Above all they want to be seen as real tough guys by dressing in black, having mohawks and smashing the windows of coffee shops. Of course when confronted with actual police and given a chance to show how tough they really are, they run like frightened rabbits. Those slow enough to get caught immediately start screaming about "Police brutality!" and how "[[true|WE ARE LIVING IN A POLICE STATE]]!!!" despite the facts that in a real police state these fags would be shot dead rather than released the next day to go crying on the CBC.

'''Undercover Police''': Act exactly like the anarchists above and in fact, they use the anarchists as their [[personal army]]. They are recognizable by the fact that their boots are the exact same brand as the boots worn by the police. They are also recognizable by the high tech equipment they carry on their persons. Occasionally they might even pull out police issue batons.

==Torontonomo Bay==
[[file:Torontonomo_bay_cell.jpg|thumb|right|The ISU would pack in up to 100 hippies in a cell like this]]
The ISU constructed a makeshift prison to house the [[over 9000|9001]] people they planned to arrest. They used an abandoned theater building in the theater district which they put in chicken cages and a group outhouse that had the doors removed. They made the hippies shit and piss in front of each other, which for the hippies, was simply a typically Sunday night.

==The one positive thing to come out of the G20 in Toronto==
[[file:byrone-sonne.jpg|thumb|left|Byron Sonne]]
[[file:kristenpeterson.jpg|thumb|right|Kristen Petersen]]
Byron Sonne, a Toronto based [[White Hat]] had been gloating when [[Weev]] got arrested on bogus charges. In Brian's words:

{{tinyquote|Oh man, pretty sweet! I've been waiting years to see weev eat a dick, and the time has come at last. Maybe there is a god.}}

Well, [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/06/23/tor-g20-arrest.html Byron got arrested in connection with the Toronto G20 a week later] for the following charges:

* Possession of explosives for an unlawful purpose.
* Possession of dangerous weapons.
* Intimidation of a justice system participant by threat.
* Intimidation of a justice system participant by watch and beset.
* Mischief.
* Attempted mischief.

Weev is out on bail but Byron is still in prison. It turned out that the police were fed up with Byron's shenanigans of probing the security fence.

In other news, Byron's ugly [[whore|common-law wife]] also got arrested but her [[anti-lulz]] parents bailed her out.[http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/06/24/second-arrest-in-g20-investigation/]
