Kirby
'''Kirby''' is a bloated, pink [[Testicle|'nad]]. He was first introduced to the mainstream in ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' to [[Goatse|widen his popularity]], as no one had ever fucking [[unwarranted self-importance|heard of him]] before. Most [[FA|fans]] of Kirby nowadays consist of the elderly and [[your mom]]. It has been said that Kirby surpasses even [[Pokemon|Jigglypuff]] on some levels, however, this is just a rumor that has been lurking in [[Ass|places unknown to humanity]].

Basically, Kirby is a pink, circular ball with [[Testicle|red "shoes"]] at the bottom and stubby arms on the left and right sides of his body. Of course, swallowing [[Watermelon|melonz]] and gaining powers is his "trademark" along with red blushes on his face. [[OM NOM NOM NOM|He will eat everything in sight, no matter the size]], much like a [[fatty]] but without the [[Diabeetus|weight gain]]. He also has clones, too, which first started to appear in the remake for ''Kirby's Adventure'' and in ''Kirby and the Amazing Mirror''. These "clones" come in three different colors: Red, Yellow, and Green. Often, these clones appear in multiplayer games and in ''Kirby and the Amazing Mirror'' as friends. However, they are fucking senseless and run around all over the place, so it's best not to bother them. They do appear in future games on the [[Nintendo DS]]. This is obvious and shouldn't be said, but Kirby sucks in both ways.

[[Image:Kirby troll.jpg|thumb|right|[[Don't feed the trolls]]!]]

After his mainstream success in elevating a fictional Italian plumber to fame, [[Jackie Chan]] was put under a lot of pressure by [[Nintendo]] to create another character they could over market and create [[over 9000]] games for.  Unlike when he designed [[copypasta|Mario and Zelda]], [[United States of America|Japan’s]] favorite game designer was completely out of [[Drugs|hallucinogenic drugs]] and therefore completely out of imagination points.  He sat and meditated, like any [[azn]] martial artist turned game designer would, and just like [[No|anything else with a religious background]] he came out with the illusion of having a pretty good idea.

Upon showing his idea to the Nintendo Executives, their trust in his ability to make something infinitely marketable made them short sighted as to how completely and utterly retarded his idea actually was.  They’re first question was why is there a face on a pom-pom? To which Jackie Chan replied [[It's a Kirby, Retard|IT’S A KIRBY GODDAMMIT!!]]  The idea was eventually credited to some other [[Kato|azn faggot]] to cover up any future embarassment.

[[Image:kirbony.jpg|thumb|right|[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Ahhh... the tables have turned.]]]]

'''''Kirby's Dream Land''''': King Derderder steals all of the food because he is a fucking [[fatass]]. Kirby must swallow [[watermelon|melonz]] and [[crap|various items]] and go on a quest to find all of it. Graphics are worse than [[shit]] when compared to ''[[Pokemon|Pokemon Red & Blue]]''. (Which were shit already.)  

'''''Kirby's Adventure''''': A favorite among the [[fanboys]], ''Kirby's Adventure'' came out for the Nintendo Erection System. In this game, when Kirby [[OM NOM NOM NOM|inhales]] melonz of any kind, they give him magical powers that when used, create special effects that don't do [[shit]]. King Derderder is still up to his [[sick fuck|old tricks again]], so he then steals the damn [[Dildo|Star Rod]] and [[Cutter|cuts his arm up into seven pieces]]. At the end of the game, a plot twist unfolds and now you have to battle Nightmare to save everyone's wet dreams. [[Moar]] shit graphics, but [[Lies|awesome music is awesome]].

'''''Kirby's Dream Land 2''''': Introduces the [[furry|animal fuckers]]. They include: Rick, Kine, and one of which being [[you]]. Still, graphics are [[shit]] and the plot has not been changed except for the edit of King Derderder to black person and food to [[shit nobody cares about]].    

'''''Kirby's Dream Land 3''''': This came out on the [[SNES|Super Nintendo Erection System]], while everything is basically the same from the previous Dream Land video game, they throw in three new [[furry|animal fuckers]]. They include: Nago the [[lolcat]], [[shit|a green bird]], and a [[mudkip|creature]] created using the ancient version of the [[Internet Hate Machine]]. [[lies|Graphics are awesome for the console (Which are rather less shitter then the last games)]] and [[lies|awesome music is awesome again]]. Also, the final boss is a [[Goatse|GIANT BLOODY EYE]], but you have to get [[over 9000]] [[Fag|Heart]] Star things to even fight it.

'''''Kirby Super Star''''': Instead of creating another game, the [[retards|geniuses]] over at Nintendo and HAL. Laboratory just created a bunch of shitty mini-games and stuffed them all into a [[SNES|Super Nintendo]] cartridge. These games are: ''[[LOL WUT|Spring Breeze]]'', ''[[School Bus Fight|The Arena]]'', ''[[No|SOUND TEST]]'', ''[[Cum|Milky Way]] Wishes'', ''Revenge of [[Batman|Meta Knight]]'', and ''[[Buttsex|The Great Cave Offensive]]''. This game, along with ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'', is responsible for another [[YouTube]] fad named [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za-ygHJ3J8E Kirbyroll].

'''''Kirby 64: [[1guy1jar|The Crystal Shards]]''''': Kirby is now viewed in three dimensions ([[fail|Nintendo 64 achieved this, of course]]), allowing users to [[sick fuck|see his circular body more clearly]]. Again like the previous Dream Land video game but with minor changes in plot/gameplay and 3D! [[OMG]]! This game also takes part in [[Nintendo|Nintendo's]] [[Fail|gimmick of putting "64" at the end of every title]]. This also has the same [[Goatse|GIANT BLOODY EYE]], but now you have to collect [[over 9000]] [[Drugs|crystal things]] instead of Heart Shards.  In the end, everybody shoves the crystal shards up their anuses and uses the blood as lubricant for their giant penguin-puffball orgies.

'''''Kirby's [[EPIC]] [[LOL WUT|Yarn]] ''''':[[Last Tursday]], [[Nintendo]] introduced it at E3.
In this game, Kirby can't even fly,and can't suck any cocks. However, he can use a Yarn to [[Rape|grab his enemies and use them like he wants to]]. The trailer, however, [[Fail|didn't show anything epic and made the boss fights look stupid]]. 

'''Every game after this is either a fucking remake or an easy piece of shit. Mostly appearing on the [[Nintendo DS]] or the Gameboy Advance.'''

== How to create a Kirby game ==
*1.Prepare a 2D game that takes 5 years to develop.
*2.Add a faggot enviroment, recycled remixed music, and a story that was pulled out of someone's ass.
*3.Create a abusable spherical character, then pretend its just as popular as other major VG characters.
*4.Make the main character [[blowjob|suck up everything in site]], then put a hat on them so it can [[megaman|copy the abilities]] of retro video games characters.
*5.[[????]]
*6.[[PROFIT]]!!!

== Lately ==
Nowadays, [[Nintendo]] is milking every idea they've had in the past (they have milked the [[Animu]] title screen for [[at least 100 years]] by now), and creating cheap remakes on the newest handheld consoles available. Other than that, they make "new" games, which are even more short, and easy, and get medium to bad reviews. Mostly saying something related to: "A little on the easy side." Although, Kirby has since become famous across the [[internets|tubes]] and has appeared in numerous fan/official games and movies, [[No|so I guess it's even]].

We suggest that you should not buy these new games unless:

* You are [[13-year-old boy|under the age of 14]].
* You are unable to enjoy [[Battletoads|better, challenging games]].
* You have a lot of [[Operation LIONCASH|Lioncash]] to waste.
* [[Basement dweller|You don't have a life]].
* You are [[faggotry|really gay]].
* Your name is [[Chris-chan|Christian Weston Chandler]].
* You meet all the above criteria (including if you're [[Shota|under 14]], whether [[Chris-chan|mentally]] or [[Midget|physically]]).

== Animu == 

OK! the guy at 4kids who thought of the lyrics should burn in Hell, while forced to stare at Goatse with a flaming spiked dildo shoved about 100 feet deep in his ass for OVER9000 years [[amirite?]]
