Jewbo

A bastardization of the word ‘Crimbo’. Although some people use the phrase Crimbo in a ''positive'' way, as an affectionate shorthand for [[Christmas|Christmas]] or Xmas, others use it ''negatively'' to reflect the shallow materialistic values the 25th of December <s>have come to</s> has always represented. Both expressions are used frequently by sane people and other non-Christians all over the planet who understand that the [[Mythology|bible]], along with all other religious texts, should go in the fiction section of every library and book store, period.

Likewise, the term ‘Jewbo’ was born out of a cynical need to express even more disdain for what is little more than a giant corporate cash cow, hosted by a fat man in a red suit who was created by a cartoonist and then adopted by the Coca-Cola corporation. It oozes irony on so many levels, as such:

#Jesus was a Jew
#Jews crucified [[Mythology|Jesus]]
#Jews don’t celebrate Christmas
#99% of [[Christian|Christians]] don’t celebrate Christmas, they just buy each other presents, perpetuating the obsession of a material existence through generations of braying little [[Americunt|brats]].
#Jews are stereotypically obsessed with both:
##Making lots of [[Jewgold|money]] (the retailers)
##Receiving lots of money (the consumers)
#Point 5. just shows how Christmas brings out the Jew in everyone
