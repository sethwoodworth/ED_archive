The '''Thunderdome''', or /td/, is the self styled /b/ of [[Chanology]]. It serves as a bastion against <strike>Enturb’s</strike> [[cancer| WWP]]’s OG worshiping fanatical tinfoil posters. Like a downs baby /td/ suffered almost immediate fail after being [[Eternal September|birthed]] from Chanology’s AIDS-ridden womb.

Originally created as a "Wall of Shame" where [[OSA]] trolls' posts were sent to die, it quickly [[fail|devolved]] into the [[B|seekrit tree fort]] of [[Enturbulation]] where the [[moralfags]] of [[Anon]] could stop faking [[V|Chaotic Good]] and revert to [[basement dwelling]] [[13-year-old]]s who would ordinarily be [[masturbating|trolling epilepsy forums]]. The Dome’s original design incorporated a series of images of [[bear|Tom Selleck]]. An obvious manifestation of Tamphex’s latent homosexuality this iteration was later scrapped for the moar heterosexual pink and purple flavor of Nazi ponies, dongcopters, and Mudkips. 

==Drama? In My Thunderdome?==
On April 5th, 2008, an Oldfag [[btard|Chananon]] named [[Rorschach]] made an eloquent and [[SFB|entirely sensible post]] in the main forums of Enturbulation. This simple request was for some of the butthurt [[aspie]] Anons of the board to stop throwing hissy fits about [[shit nobody cares about|puerile schoolyard spats]] and to "grow the fuck up", the better to systematically dismantle The Cult of Fail. 

After several supportive posts in response, some Aspie mod called "[[dr3k]]" (from the word dreck, meaning Jew) quickly pounced, throwing the post into the the garbage (aka the Thunderdome) and permaba& Rorschach. After this Rorschach posted saying [[kthxbye]] to the forum, since the constant [[facepalm]] moments were leaving a permanent hand print on his face. 

Dr3k's goal was to keep all of this out of view, so that the drama, [[incest|internecine]] bitching and sniveling could continue. Rorschach was rightfully [[pissed|wroth]] with high displeasure at the drama queen's [[faggotry|hijinx]] and left the scene to go get his [[drunk|drank]] on. Immediately, however, another mod unbanned Rorschach, [[b&|perma-banned]] dr3k, and made Rorschach's post into a "sticky" in the main forum.

Dr3k is now rumored to currently be living in Missouri conducting a '''[[homosexual|perfectly platonic relationship]]''' with ex-dome moderator Selleck.

==WTF is a Horseman? ==
The term "[[darkhorseman|horsemen]]" or "[[Mr. Hands|horseman]]" was coined 2008 B.V. (Before Vagoo)  in the Thunderdome to describe the homoerotic relationship many of the original posters within the sub-forum shared. Either that or it refers to the [[special Olympics|top four dome trolls]] ([[Nazi|Selleck]][[Irish|,MegaphoneBitch]],[[ BAWWWWW|Gunslinger]], and [[Leet|Skeptic]]) who were bestowed /td/ limited mod powerz by the great [[ramen|LE]]. With their powers <strike>combined they became '''CAPTAIN FAGGOT'''</strike> they bestowed much needed [[rape|raepage]] upon the ever increasing numbers of failtrolls that frequented the dome.

== 6/21/08 ==
On this date /td/ was locked, all threads but the one saying [[GTFO]] having been deleted. The [[faggots|mods]], having reached a [[bullshit|consensus]], decided that the dome had become a cesspool of faggotry and disease ''' [[Truth|Trufax]]'''.

After an unanticipated amount of bawww domers were told to go make their own treefort. This was otherwise known as '''LE’s big fucking mistake'''. The new offsite Thunderdome was born (later becoming Scientology Exposed) and as their first action they began to hatch plans to turn Enturb into one giant [[Apocalypse|clusterfuck]]. The key to this plan was provided by [[Epic|TakeAnonMe]], an administrator at the time. Due to being just shitfuckingtired of the way that LE randomly screwed things up on the site he handed out his administrative password. By basically giving them the keys to the city TAM allowed domers to go to town in the normally invisible mod forum.

Unsurprisingly there was massive amounts of soon to be [[drama]] found within its chambers. In addition to the dome closing coup it was revealed that the moderators had been utilizing a SP/miserable users list that wreaked havoc with certain disfavored users who were trying to connect to the forum. The site’s main page was soon blazoned with the below image.

[[Image:Enturbulation_drama.jpg|center]]

Upon seeing this message, every single user simultaneously shat bricks and proceeded to BAAAAAAW on IRC. It then changed to ''"*Purging Cancer*"'' followed by ''“*Pool’s closed due to Aids*”'' before the forums came online again minutes later, with no obvious changes. Needless to say, much hysteria ensued with the paranoid screaming that /b/ had hacked the site, whilst others claimed it was the work of Nazi mods. [[Some argue]] that this entire drama was in fact an epic troll by LE and the rest of the admins. These people are [[faggots]].

This was followed by the site wide spamming of the entire mod forum’s contents along with the  temporary reopening of the dome by  [[fat|Tuesday]].The already churning shitstorm now accelerated into a full blown hurricane of faggotry; cocks invaded unwilling mouths and anuses alike  from nearly every direction. It was moar [[cock|knob]] than even the mods could gobble and thus, less than 48 hours later, the Thunderdome was permanently reopened by [[Tranny|Poppins]] to the public.

The lesson from all of this, while not entirely learned, was that if you clog up the sewer the shit eventually backs up into your fucking house.

== What Sparked this Faggotry? ==

[[Image:Megacrotch.jpg|thumb|right|Yeah, he’s one of ours.]]

Rumors surrounding /td/’s closing abound. [[fags|Some]] attributed it to [[Batman|Daywatch]]/[[whore|Thetan Ass]] dick sucking [[troll|drama]]. Others cited the epic trolling of [[ruining the internet|Tory Magoo]] After stumbling into the dome like the [[cunt|sweet old woman]] that she is Vagoo challenged the dome to give her its best shot. When the flaming spunk spattered across that whore mouth she proceeded to [[BAWWWW]] like a [[emo|baby]] while calling people [[furry|OSA]] like a [[size queen|drama]] queen.  

For moar delicious drama on this subject check out  [[Magoogate]].

Also here is a compilation of Magoo’s posts for those of you inclined to see [http://forums.whyweprotest.net/291-scientology-activism/last-magoo-thread-24000/ what a batshit insane cunt she really is.]

The only absolute facts are that the [[circle jerk|Thunderdome]] was shut down by LE after  one of his typical benders where he’d [[lulz|fuck random shit up]]. This resulted in a thread in the [[Enturbulation]] mod forum about "Not liking the TD", which made [[junkie|Stu]] and black person cream their collective panties. After that the entire dome was shitcanned  to the displeasure of everyone who wasn't a sissy bitch.

As an added bonus these events resulted in the resignation of [[douche|Tamphex]] and the demodification of [[stoner|Stu Wyatt]]. Also, LE is still a [[dildo|cunt pickle]].

Poppins also enjoyed some positive notoriety before he died due to complications with an [[buttsecks|anal fissure]]

== Reclamation: Phase 3 ==
For once domers actually got off of their collective [[fat|asses]] and attempted to contribute something. Mind you, it achieved absolutely [[fail|nothing]], but it did spark a round of [[auto-fellatio|creativity]] and a wave of [[you|inspiring]] videos. The intent of the project was to reclaim Chanology from the grip of the [[moralfags]] that had come to dominate the protest environment.

'''<U>Current Status: MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!!</U>'''

Reclamation has thus far yielded positive results by eliminating the influx of [[newfags]] and returning both the protests, and the movement at large, to their rightful seat of [[lies|lulz]].

== 11/29/08 The Day Enturb Stood Still ==
One day enturbulators attempted to login only to find that they were trying to connect to a server that was no longer there.  The reason? LE had sold the server for a ticket to LExico so he could buy ramen, hookers and blow (in exactly that order). In truth only LE and Poppins know exactly what went down. Supposedly LE feared a physical theft of the server by [[Poop]]ins so he took it offline and ran off along with all of the donations. To this date he has never made an attempt to restore any of these items thus proving that you should never evar give your money to a Jew.

After the inevitable implosion of [[Africa|Enturbulation]] and LE's disappearance other networks were setup or adapted to suit the needs of the [[Anonymous]] that constantly shit up the dome. After a brief time [[moralfag|Gregg]] and [[trap|Poppins]] got married and Enturbulation's database was migrated over to [[marblecake|WhyWeProtest]] along with the original Thunderdome. Sadly, many of the users who once brought life to that hell hole have moved on or simply don't give a shit about [[Project Chanology]] anymore. This has led to WhyWeProtest turning into a hive of faggotry and pointless OCMB moonbattery.

Whatever the case, most of the [[bestiality|horsemen]], along with the other self important /td/ faggots, are still kicking around in some way shape, or form.

==Current Events==
[[Image:Bill%27s_a_faggot.jpg|thumb|right|That about sums it up.]]
This month's [[faggotry]] was brought to you by the letter K. Showing an even greater amount of [[fail]] than usual [[drunk|King Nerd]] made the announcement that he had [[theft|obtained]] a list disclosing both [[scientology|scilon]] plants at [[WWP]] and a list of top targets from chanology. After making mention of this to several [[moron|people who trusted him]] a call for [[docs|dox]] or [[gtfo]] was placed. Unfortunately the genius didn't take any pictures, but instead wrote the list down on the back of a [[alcohol|jack daniels]] wrapper, thus nullifying any chance of confirmation. 

Regardless, [[ass|Kerd]] called a [[bukkake|council]] with a small group of prominent [[chanology|chanologists]]. Upon arriving the group quickly learned that [[Fucktard|King Nerd]] is truly a brainless sack of [[shit]]. Instead of having the list typed up and ready to present he informed the group that he was too busy drinking his own [[sperm]] to have it ready. Instead he presented a partial list that involved people who were obviously not plants. [[RAGE|Instarage]] fell over the entire crowd with several chanologists [[ragequit|quitting]] within minutes. In fact, everyone at the meeting left before Nerd could finally get his [[crap|shit]] together, but not before sending numerous harsh words, curses, and death-threats his way.

The list, in its entirety appeared the next day in [[thunderdome|/td/]], but still didn't contain the supposed scilon hitlist that had originally been promised. However, by that time the only thing anyone cared about was [[rape|tearing Kerd a new one]]. Recently he's [[Shit nobody cares about|returned]] sporting an even greater amount of [[fail]] than before . Hopefully a [[An_hero|happy resolution]] can be found for all parties in the near future.
