Confirm/deny
Confirm/Deny is an [[Internets]] phrase commonly used immediately after a statement by the poster to the postee. 

<b>For example:</b> "You are [[Anonymous|anonymous]] - confirm/deny."

Because the phrase is used as a statement rather than [[Has_anyone_really_been_far_even_as_decided_to_use_even_go_want_to_do_look_more_like?|an inquiry]], it leaves the reader with the impression that the statement is a fact. Therefore it is useful to insult the [[loser|postee]] without explicitly stating the insult. In addition, the postee's only defensive option is to deny, which means they have to acknowledge the statement, and therefore lend it legitimacy regardless of how [[Insane|ridiculous]].
