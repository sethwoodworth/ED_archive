'''Wicca''' is the shittiest subset of the [[pagan]] expression of [[religion]].  It is favored by people too [[fucktarded]] to learn the rules of a real religion and too poor to join any other [[Scientology|cult]]. Most modern Wiccans will claim to be in it for the [[Emo|self-expression]] and [[sex|becoming more in touch with the world]]. Expect these [[retards]] to say ''Oh Goddess!'' in lieu of proper [[Homosexual epithets|epithets]].

There are two flavors of Wicca: one was invented by a [[Britfag]] named Gerald Gardner in the 1950's ([[Wikipedia:Wicca|even TOW agrees]]); the other by a [[woman]] who calls herself Silver [[otherkin|RavenWolf]] for the benefit of those who were too lazy to find a real coven, panicked at the thought of having to deal with real [[priest]]s, or found that [[rules|The Ardanes]] was [[TL;DR]]. Since all [[16-year-old girl|16-year-olds]] agree that Silver RavenWolf understands the [[sex|true meaning of Wicca]] better than that weird old bearded fart and 16-year-olds know [[everything]], that's the version documented in this article.

Wicca has only one rule: '''An it harm none, do what ye will''', which makes Wicca as [[pussy]] as it is stupid. Wiccans delude themselves into thinking they can perform "[[magic]]" just by dancing around [[naked]]  with shiny rocks laid on the ground in [[Random|mystical]] patterns. 

If you see a [[MySpace]], [[Live Journal]], [[Facebook]], etc. profile saying something like '''''<span style="color:darkred;">Proud</span> <span style="color:royalblue;">to</span> <span style="color:blue;">be</span> <span style="color:purple;">a witch</span> ! ! !''''', you can be [[99.9%]] confident that you're dealing with a Wiccan.

Wiccans are divided into little [[gangs]] called "[[clusterfuck|covens]]", usually with contrived and melodramatic names like ''The Silver Moon Circle'', the ''Black Pentacle'' or ''The Raven and the Rose''. [[Seriously]]. Wiccan covens are full of pot smoking [[alcoholic]] female [[fatties]] (unless they're too young to drink, in which case they're just fat), with a few token males who join out of faggotry or in a hopeless attempt to get laid.

Wiccans can be easily confused with obsessed fans of the fantasy genre, for instance people who dress up as [[Harry Potter]] or [[Lord of the Rings]] characters. Another group easily mistaken for Wiccans are [[LARP]] and [[Dungeons & Dragons]] roleplayers. However, there is a simple way to distinguish these groups from Wiccans. The essential difference is that these cosplaying and roleplaying nerds, while annoying and immature, know that they're just playing a little fantasy game, whereas the Wiccans actually believe that their magic wands and elvenlore are real things. This often leads to a painful disillusionment, when a Wiccan realizes that he or she cannot pay the rent or find a job by casting a magic spell.

== Wiccan Doctrine ==
[[Image:Sabrina.jpg|thumb|Wiccan Inspirational leader]]

Wicca is really just dumbed-down [[Satanism]] for really fucking [[lazy]] people. Wiccans will try to convince you that their religion has nothing to do with Satanism by claiming that their religion is [[over 9000]] years old, because any ancient religion that involves at least one goddess was obviously a branch of Wicca.

Since Wicca does not require any special tools, ordained priests, or even a building to worship in, it is the ideal cult for lazy [[poor]] people, even though Wiccans are still encouraged to buy loads of worthless [[plastic crap]] from occult shops. This means that even though Wicca is as phony as [[Scientology]], at least it won't fuck you out of your money. 
 
Since Wicca has no established doctrines, half of the things they do are pulled out of the Coven Leader's ass. The other half is a mish-mash of pseudo-religion stolen from Medieval Catholic documents on witches, ''[[Harry Potter]]'', [[Disney]] films and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. When confronted with that fact, Wiccans will scream "[[NO U]]" and then proceed to bitch about how Christians [[stole]] [[everything]] from them.

Wiccans (usually those who don't subscribe to Silver RavenWolf's [[piss|watered]]-[[lame|down]] version) might tell you that most of their religion is derived from a ''[[Wikipedia:Book of Shadows|Book of Shadows]]'' that only the innermost circle of Wiccans are allowed to read. Like the [[Xenu]] story, this is probably because its contents are so dumb that you can only be given it when you absolutely have to believe it. 

Wicca is the official religion of [[feminism]], as all [[real]] religions refuse to give women power. Wicca [[Some argue|is believed to]] spread [[furfaggotry]] and [[otherkin]]ism, making it a sort of gateway [[drug]] of faggotry.

== Wiccans Defined ==
[[Image:Wiccan lady J2.jpg|thumb|right|The fuglies, the social misfits, the vegans, the dykes, the poor. All are drawn to wicca's charm.]] 

Modern witches are [[insane]], [[attention whore|attention whoring]], [[self-injuring]] [[16 year old girls]] that are very easy to piss off. They hate to be confused with [[Goths]], [[emos]] or [[vampires]] and will [[Meaningless noise|totally cast a spell on you]] if you do. Any [[green]] asshole wishing to pursue an exciting career as an internet [[troll]] should find a witch community.

Wiccans [[old people|over the age of thirty]] are extremely rare, partially due to the fact that they have no time for such nonsense once they have been kicked out of their parents' [[basement]], but mostly because they have been brought to [[kill it with fire|justice]] long before that. The rare Wiccan past thirty is most often a [[fat]] woman who believes her cats are 'children', or a dragon-shirted male suffering from [[fail]].

They wear black almost universally, even though [[real]] Europagans wore white. Wicca is usually [[matriarchal]], while real Europagans were usually led by male druids (the equivalents of [[doctor]]s and [[lawyers]], so if you meet anyone who calls him or herself a druid, ask to see his/her Ph.D or license). Everything about Wicca is designed specifically to scare conservative [[Christians]], which is completely out-of-line with pre-Christian paganism and makes Wicca more of a [[trolling]] technique than a real religion.

=== Origins ===

Wiccans may tell you that they're descended from six or more generations of Wiccans, in spite of the fact that they live with their [[white middle class liberal|affluent vanilla]] parents and that Wicca has only been around since 1954 (1951 if ''really'' stretching it and considering [[Way_before_the_internets|Ancient History]]). Failing this, a Wiccan may also claim to have been reincarnated several times over (almost always as a well-known historical figure, such as [[unwarranted self-importance|Cleopatra]]; [[lulz]] ensue if you bring two (or more!) people who claim to be the same person together), or whine about the [[fail|poor witches persecuted in Salem]]. Wiccans who are called out on their bullshit or don't do either of the above may instead call themselves [[Gypsies]], even though Gypsies (or ''Roma'') are a race of smelly [[Indians]] who [[lie]] and [[steal]], giving them more in common with [[niggers]] than with Wicca or its supposed origins.

== The "Many" Uses of Witches ==

* [[Trolling]] [[Catholics]], [[Fundies]] and other [[:Template:Religions|religious individuals]]
* [[Kill it with fire|Fuel for the fire]]
* [http://www.goddess.org/religious_sex.html Lots and lots of sex]

== Trolling Wiccans ==
* Demand [[dox|vouchers]] so they can prove they don't belong to Team [[otherkin|RavenWolf]].
* If they're under 18, ask them how they can be Wiccan if Wicca requires one to do [[cunnilingus|things]] with an adult that no one [[underage]] is allowed to do.
* [[Monty Python|Ask if they weigh the same as a duck.]]
* Remind them that no real witches were persecuted in Salem during the witch trials.
* Ask for a spell to smite your annoying neighbor.
* Tell them that worshiping any god other than [[Yahweh]] is equivalent to [[Satanism]].
* When encountering a self-proclaimed "[[basement dweller|solitary Wiccan]]," ask her if she performs the Great Rite [[masturbation|solo]].
* Point out that the essence of magick is (like all other religions) just wishing really hard, and refusing to admit that it doesn't work.
*Point out that their "Five-Fold Kiss" does indeed involve genitalia and boobs, because Gerald Gardner was a horny old [[pedobear|man]] pining for teh [[Secks]]. If they start to yell at you, point out that they don't know their own [[cult|religion]]'s most basic "rituals".
