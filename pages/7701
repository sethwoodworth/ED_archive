'''Space''' is a place where nobody can hear you scream, also a majestic fairy-tale wonderland that [[Atheist]]s use as proof that [[God]] does not exist, and for [[Joss Whedon]] to set his [[Firefly|miserable television show]]. It is supposedly populated by [[gay niggers from outer space|gay niggers]] and [[aliens]].

The truth is that space was invented by [[Anonymous_Hijack_NASA_Slogan|NASA]] during the [[hippy|1950's]] as a plot to give [[Russia|the Ruskies]] srs [[penis envy]]. [[CSIII]]-graduates from both countries spent [[at least 100]] billion dollars building bigger rockets with moar [[secks|thrust]] and a larger [[cum|payload]] in order to prove they had the most potent nukular arsenal, the [[old media|pre-tubes]] analogue of an [[e-penis]]. In order to keep this elaborate [[lie|farce]] afloat, they started strapping primates into these rockets to prove that they were doing it all [[for the lulz|in the name of science]]. Naturally, as soon as these rockets passed the clouds, they entered the Kingdom of [[Heaven]], where God promptly bitch-slapped the rockets right back to Earth, instantly [[pwned|killing said monkeys]].

In spite of the fact that it doesn’t actually exist, many people claim to have been in space, even walked on the moon. NASA has video of two men that they say “walked on the moon.” [[Some argue]] that this video was doctored, and the two men are actually [[Jews]] in full body [[condoms]] dancing Hava Nagila in the [[Israeli]] desert at night. This issue is a popular one for [[basement dwellers]] on [[conspiracy]] forums and [[Libertarian]] [[IRC]] channels.

People who claim to have been in space call themselves “astronauts,” and will go to great lengths to convince you of its reality and having “been out there.” In reality, these people spent months [[drugs|tripping constant balls]] in a CIA holding cell, being read [[Star Wars]] slashfics by [[Canadia|Rick Moranis]] over a loudspeaker.

Also, according to a [[Patrick_Stewart|bald man, Patrick Stewart]], [[star trek|space is teh final frontier]]. This [[Patrick_Stewart|bald man, Patrick Stewart]]'s opinion is bullshit. (''The last two sentence were written under the influence of Experimental Space Drugs.'')

==Space Bar==

[[File:Apollo11.jpg|thumb|Even though Photoshop had not been invented in 1969, sceptics point out that this photo from the Apollo 11 mission may have been faked.]]

''Space Bar is a place''<br>
''A place where nothing ever happens''<br>

Without Space Bar then [[you]]r [[ED]] entries would look like this;

==The Apollos==

===Apollo 1===

[[Jews]] opposed to Nazi Werner Bruan fill the space capsule with velcro, copies of the Protocols of The Elders of Zion and lit menorahs, providing us with our first taste of Crispy Astronaut Latke.

===Apollo 7===

[[Hookers and blow]] are smuggled into space thereby inventing the biro pen, bendy straws and the sex position known as the Weightless Reverse Cowgirl.

===Apollo 8===

From [[wikipedia|Stickipedia]]; "About an hour after starting his sleep shift, Borman requested clearance to take a [[jenkem|Seconal sleeping pill]]. However, the pill had little effect. Borman eventually fell asleep but then awoke feeling ill. He vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea that left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces."

Crew dump Borman out of the airlock and defect to the [[soviet|Soviet Union]].

===Apollo 10===

NASA discovers that the "Lunar Module" which they had commissioned from Tony Soprano on [[Long Island]] is in fact an old tumble dryer covered in gold foil and shunt-welded onto the chassis of a [[india|Hindustani Ambassador]]. They realise that the Moon landing will have to be faked.

===Apollo 11===

Armstrong and Aldrin are fed [[LSD]] and stuffed into an isolation tank whilst special effects supremo Ray Harryhausen produces a realistic movie of a moon landing complete with sword-fighting [[ana|skeleton]]s and a rubber [[dinosaur|brontosaurus]]. Armstrong's inpromptu speech on stepping into what he thinks is the moon -  "where dem selenite wimmin at?" - is hastily over-dubbed by actor [[Ronald Reagan]].

===Apollo 12-20===

All further flights cancelled in order to divert the money to the 1972 Committee to Re-elect the [[Nixon|President]].

===Apollo 440===

Produced the single "[[Lolita]]", "Lost In Space" and "Dude Falling Down A Staircase", and the soundtrack to [[PlayStation]] Game "Vapid Racer".

==Famous Lady Astronauts==
[[Image:Ulala.jpg|thumb|Not Lisa Nowak]]
===Major Tom===
Not strictly a lady, but [[David Bowie]] instead. Nuff said

===Ulala from Space Channel 5===
Famous for the words "Up, right, right, down, shoot, shoot, shoot" and her friendship with Space [[Michael Jackson]]

===Colonel-Engineer Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova===
First woman in space, who threw up whilst trying to parallel park Vostok 6. Voted "Worse Space Pilot Eva" until her title was stolen from her by Christa McAuliffe,  who tragicallly mistook reverse for third gear during the launch of the Space Shuttle [[Challenger]].

===[[Lisa Nowak]]===
Led to 3058 stories on Google when she tracked and attacked another lady astronaut over a male astronaut. Or something.

===Ridley from Alien===
Wears tight white [[panties]]. She's only in a film though. Real lady astronauts have to wear daipers like as if they were permanently on the blob. Yuk.

===Barbarella===
Invented "Tits or GTFO In Space". Commenting on [[ED]]; "Make love? But no one's done that for hundreds of centuries!"

==Fact of the day==

The [[American]]s in the form of [[NAMBLA|NASA]] spent millions of [[money]] developing a pen that would write in space [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Pen].
The [[Russian]]s, in contrast, simply wrote on the walls with fresh virgin blood.

==Personal space==

According to research from the [[nazi|German Institute For Phrenology]] different races have different ideas about the comfortable distance to remain from other people, that is, the concept of "personal space". So next time a [[Chinese]] person walks straight into you on the street, just put it down to a celebration of cultural diversity. Here are the [[science]] results made simpler using [[Paint]];
