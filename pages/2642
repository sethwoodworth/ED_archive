Emma Drama
{{potential}}

Emma_Drama all started with a [[fanfic|brilliant work of art]] written by the ex-fiance of [[fag|Gerard Way]] of the band, [[My Chemical Romance]]. The story was filled with a [[Mary Sue]] named Emma and involved wish fulfillment of the utmost kind.

The storyline involves Emma falling in love with this [[transvestite|guy]] Paul, who was in a band called The Black Pajama Party. (I shit you not) with his brother and a bunch of other people who don't matter because they aren't the lead singer. She stalks him until he agrees to [[rape|fuck]] her after getting really turned on while touching her belt. Meanwhile, she sleeps with the whole band and when Paul dumps her for being a dirty [[whore]], she tries to kill herself with sticks. The sticks don't work because she cuts, [[fail|across the street instead of down the road]] and so she doesn't become [[an hero]]. She goes and helps the [[hippies|homeless]] and is single for the rest of her life because she [[lie|doesn't need a man to complete her]].

==Myspace-Gate==
A [[Divide By Zero|brilliant]] [http://community.livejournal.com/emma_drama/1249.html?thread=22241#t22241 suggestion was made] that the community members should make [[MySpace]]s for the characters from the story. What went down is that, in the beginning, Paul and Emma were enjoying [[pedobear|young love]]. Emma was [[rape|seduced]] into cheating on Paul by the sharp pieces of wood, who were there for her in her time of [[emo|need]]. Paul dumped her ass and dated Bret, who was in some other band. The band's mortal enemies are some band called [[My Chemical Romance|My Alcohol Romance]], who suck slightly more than the Black Pajama Party.

==The Gifted & Talented Bullshit==
So lj user {{lj|user=jennasie}} phoned in the first time Eliza appeared on [[pussy|Fearless]] Radio. She basically went apeshit on Eliza, telling her to stop "pussyfooting" around and [[STFU|admit it]]. So, Eliza commented on how she was engaged to a great man named Gerard, or some shit like that. [[Some argue]] Jennasie was a bitch for making the call, as Eliza seemed pretty depressed following it, but because she expected to cry anyway, [[Nobody Cares|nobody cares]]. A more [[The Internet is serious business|serious]] question that was asked during this same radio show was, "How did Emma think Paul was in bed?" While most sane people would not want to know, these people are from [http://emma-drama.livejournal.com| Emma Drama], so they don't actually know what [[DO NOT WANT]] is. Anyway, Eliza replied that, "Emma thought Paul was gifted and talented in many ways." [[Some argue]] the validity of this statement, but [[shit nobody cares about|no one cares]] about My Chemical Romance.

==Fearless Radio Gets Involved==
[[Image:Fearlessradio.jpg|thumb|FearlessRadio00 enters the room]]
[[At Least 100|At Least 100 years ago]], the community went apeshit when they invited Fearless Radio, the Radio Show of Christopher Gutierrez (speaker who notable feuded with [[fag|Pete Wentz]] and, in return, got a song written about him), which featured Eliza Cuts (writer of the [[fanfic]]), into their aim chatroom. Much [[lulz]] was held as Michelle, the woman who was pinned with forwarding all instant messages to the radio show, played along and conversed with the members. Her attempts to keep up with the chat were futile and she kept screaming out the phone number and telling people to say "I love you" to Kris. The community regarded this chatroom as [[epic]], as Michelle asked to be included in future talks. Because Michelle knows Eliza [[IRL]], the community shit itself.

==OHIHATEELIZA SPAMMAGE==
[[Image:OHIHATEELIZA.png |thumb|OHIHATEELIZA SPAMMAGE COMMENSES]]
{{lj|user=surge_me}} and {{lj|user=misery_passion}} were feeling randy but instead of doing something about it, they decided it would be funny to post macros over at a post in {{lj|user=ohihateeliza}}. Unfortunately, photobucket was down for maintenance and they had to settle with spamming old shit. Two more posts were made acknowledging the asskissing of the community. The {{lj|user=ohihateeliza}} mod was [[butthurt]] and deleted the additional posts, as well as posting a followup in both communities.

==Regs==
*{{lj|user=misery-passion}} - Apart from having an [[emo]] username, she is an [[attention whore]] who really just wanted her own livejournal community, even though it's made of fail and aids. She's also a [[Hookers and blow|hooker]] for [http://surge-me.livejournal.com surge-me]. She's the mod of the aforementioned community.
*{{lj|user=surge-me}} - Druggie. A loud-mouth bitch who needs to learn to [[STFU]]. She likes [[The Beatles]] and [[Lord of the Rings]]. The only good thing about her is that she tells everyone [[Jews Did WTC]].
*{{lj|user=nmhrbrtsn}} - Obsessed 30 Seconds to Mars and [[My Chemical Romance]] fangirl. Would suck [[Shit nobody cares about|Jared Leto]]'s dick for a dollar. Likes to rant about how Jared Leto and Paris Hilton are her OTP, and talk about bbqs.
*{{lj|user=lupilups}} - Likes faggy bands like [[Linkin Park]] and [[My Chemical Romance]] and even [[Goatse|Panic at the Disco]]. Also, she's married. That makes her the only community member potentially older than [[16-year-old girl|twelve]]. (Come on, they like [[buttsex|My Chemical Romance]].) She is from [[Mexico]], and she says she [[lie|would never move to the US]].
*{{lj|user=scatteredxtime}} - A bitch who is [[asking for it]]. [[Last Thursday]], she called in to Ecut's radio show to talk about [[SIF|Taco Bell]] and other [[shit nobody cares about]]. She is boring as shit, but posts [[macros]] to try and make herself look interesting. She is also a [[sick fuck]] who parades as [[furry|Gerard Way]]'s mom on [[MySpace]], where she asks fags like [[emo|Pete Wentz]] and other members of her fake sons' [[shit]] band to stick it up her [[cunt]].
*{{lj|user=frankokoko}} - She is obsessed with [[midget|Frank Iero]] and is a [[virgin]] who posted about her first [[STD|kiss]] [[Last Thursday]]. She also called in to Eliza Cuts' radio show and is suffering the long-distance-charges consequence. She also likes [[Samuel L. Jackson|Cobra Starship]]. 
*{{lj|user=emmlar}} - is actually [[Fag|Ryan Ross]], and hence enjoys regular [[rape|sex]] with [[Emo|Brendon Urie]].
*{{lj|user=cherryreefer}} - claims to have a [[lies|thirteen-inch dick]] (has yet to be confirmed) and is [[e-penis|not afraid to use it]]. Likes to drink a lot and believes in [[jailbait|child labor]].
*{{lj|user=brianabutane}} - The [[Midget|short]] Italian kid who uploaded the Fearless Radio chat transcript. She rarely uses the capslock button, even though that's the point of the community [[Amirite|amirite?]], because she prefers to use the [[Epic Fail|shift key]]. She also has questionable taste in music (see also: [[shit|Cobra Starship]]).
*{{lj|user=zephyrina}} - The living proof that wisdom doesn't come with age. She's still [[nobody cares|undecided]] about what she likes best, if [[black metal]] or [[My Chemical Romance]], but since she likes to be prepared, she has already obtained her husband's official permission to fuck [[retard|Bob Bryar]], should she ever meet him while running errands. All in all, a self-righteous [[bitch]] who's [[pedobear|too old]] for this [[shit]] and who should know better.
*{{lj|user=crossbow1}} - The most hated person in the My Chemical Romance [[fandom]].
*{{lj|user=jcmmyhero}} - Comments on fucking everything even when there isn't anything to say. Not funny.

== Emma's Story ==
  Now this is the story all about how
  My Chem fandom got flipped, turned upside down
  And i'd like to take a moment, just sit the fuck down, k?
  I'll tell you how I became the hero of a comm on lj.
  -
  Somewhere in Germany, I was born and raised
  Divorced at the gym, where I spent most of my days
  Fangirling and Fawning, Pussyfooting all cool
  And all slitting my wrists with wood outside of the school
  When a couple of hair stylists said "We're up to no good"
  Started making trouble in my neighbourhood
  I started cutting hair and it scared my mama
  She said "You're movin with your bitches and whores in Emma Drama!"
  -
  I whistled for a tour bus, and when it came near
  License plate said "Fresh Michelle" and it had dice in the mirror
  If anything, I could say that this bus had aidz
  I heard the commun shout, "You gonna get raped!"
  -
  I pulled up to rehab about seven or eight
  And I yelled to the guitarist "Yo Homes, smell ya later!"
  Paul touched my belt, he called me a drama llama
  I said "Fuck You, I'm going home to Emma Drama!"

==BALEETED==

As of October 10 2008, E_D is no more.  The community's maintainer, {{lj|misery-passion}}, went bipolar on us again and took down the site.  Her life was just ~too hard for her to deal with another such burden on her shoulders.  Please to be spamming her with [[goatse]] nao, plzkthx.

Although the comm had been pretty much dead for some time before its demise, it was still the centerpiece of this entire shit circus, and now the final resting place for so many memories.  Good tiems, good tiems.
