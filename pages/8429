A '''Time Paradox''', also recently known as Pime Taradox by those who like to perpetuate it as a [[forced meme]], describes something that could never happen, [[Harlequin Ichthyosis Fetus|ever]], but if it DOES happen, the amount of [[AIDS]], [[Epic|Epicness]], [[Winnar|Winrar]]  and [[lulz]] grows into epic and dangerous proportions that can make you piss yourself or even kill [[you]] or someone else. 

[[/b/]] gets concerned every time a Time Paradox happens, because it can kill /b/ itself. Cant happen as it's impossible.


Time paradox was created [[at least 100]] years ago and the probabilities of happening are from [[over 9000]] to [[oneoneone|one]].

== How to create a Time Paradox ==

1.- Do something so fucking impossibly [[epic]], for the [[lulz]].

2.- Wait for users crying "PIME TARADOX!"

3.- ?????

4.- PROFIT!

== Examples of time paradoxes ==

=== [[Divide by zero|Dividing by zero]] ===

Not as epic as others, but dividing by zero in an original way can create a Time Paradox.

Normal division by zero: 1/0

Epic division by zero, and Time paradox: 1/-0

=== Guessing a [[GET]] ===

Usually done by modfaggotry, but sometimes is proved that not. Guessing a get or [[You fail it|failing at it]] causes so much [[lulz]] that makes an unbelievable Time Paradox.

===Menstrual Painting of a Minstrel===

If you paint a Minstrel using Menstrual Blood, it will create a time paradox that will open once a month.

===Killing Ocelot===

If you kill Ocelot in 1964, Colonel tells you that you've created a time paradox. So seriously, don't do it. Not even the Revival Pill will help you.

=== Simutaneous [[Falcon Punch]] ===

Scientists at the University of /b/ have discovered a new way to create a time paradox; play ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' (any version) with two Captain Falcons, and use Falcon Punch at EXACTLY the the same time. Doing this via N64 emulator has been proven to destroy hard drives and operating systems, as shown below.

They're currently investigating the true power of the simultaneous at [[Nerds|CERN]], using the [[LHC|Large Falcon Punch Collider]], it's said that it caused the big bang, which made the entire fucking universe.

=== 1=2 ===

if: a=1

and: b=1

thus: a=b

then: ab=b^2

then we: ab -a^2= b^2 -a^2

so we: a^2 -ab=a^2 -b^2

now we: a(a-b)=(a+b)(a-b)

lets remove the (a-b)Â´s: a=(a+b)

replace with their real value: 1=(1+1)

result: 1=2

You can fool [[retards]] who haven't discovered the wonders of [[divide by zero|dividing by zero]] and cause butthurt on [[nerds|mathematicians]] with this equation.

=== Getting a fusion combo ===

When two people attempt to do a combo on the same thread, and both of them attempt to break each other's combos out, you can create a fusion. If done correctly, a big Time paradox will occur.

=== Failget ===

An [[epic]] failget produces so much [[lulz]] that creates a Paradox.

=== Mixing Coke and Pepsi ===
Due to the extremely competitive nature of the Coca-Cola and Pepsi companies, if you mix Coke and Pepsi, the extreme angst generated will create a Time Paradox, as well as a possible lawlsuit.

=== Larry Bird ===
He's [[white]], and is good at basketball. Wait, what?

=== German Jews ===
Oh wait, they just become [[an hero]].
