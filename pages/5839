Several things can get your entry flushed from a Wiki.<br>
On [[ED|Uncyclopedia]], it's use of the word "[[cunt]]". <br>
On [[Uncyclopedia|Wikipedia]], it's the mention of Encyclopedia Dramatica.<br> 
On [[Wikipedia|Encyclopedia Dramatica]], the chief criterion for flushing involves articles that are "[[Exhibit C|not internet relevant]]" <s>or which use strikeouts</s>. <br>

==A list of things that are "not internet relevant"==

Any articles on these topics will be [[banhammer|flushed]] down the [[toilet|plumbing]] of the internet [[tubes]];

==How to convert an article from "not internet relevant" to "internet relevant"==

Before;<br>

''Wikipedia (wiːkiˈpiːdiə) is a multilingual, World Wide Web-based, [[encyclopedia]] project operated by the [[disney|Wikimedia Foundation]]. Many language versions of Wikipedia are [[mexico|free content]], while others, such as the English version, include non-free material. It is the largest, most extensive and fastest growing encyclopedia currently available on the [[Internet]].''<br><br>

After;<br><br>
''Wikipedia is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) in which participants play editors of a hypothetical online encyclopedia, where they try to insert misinformation that they are randomly assigned when they create their accounts, while preventing contrary information from being entered by others. Players with similar misinformation to promote will generally form "guilds" in order to aid each other.''<br>

==ED is for purists==

Take care only to post "[[I Can Has Cheezburger?|in-joke]]" humour (Spanglish: "humor") only appreciated by [[basement dwellers]] who spend [[win|25 hours a day]] on [[LJ|t'Interweb]] and who have been [[nerds]] since at least [[100 years ago]]. Unless you've found some [[rule 34]] porn. Then post it anyway, "internet relevant" or not. Otherwise [[uncyclopedia|ED]] might run out of topics.

==Rule Number One of Fight Club==

Do not under any circumstances attempt to [[troll]] ED by posting [[lulz|satirical articles]] about ED [[alcohol|editorial policy]] at ED. That's just [[retard|stupid]].

==About people who post the "I need moar internets" cat picture==

[[File:Cat Moar Internets.jpg|120px|right]]
"The Internet is full of young, hyperactive, undereducated and unskilled typists who, while already are incapable of correctly spelling half the words in the English language, manage to brutally mangle up the other half for not knowing how to navigate a keyboard. Thus, misspelling in of itself is a popular meme, and certain misspellings become so essential in forum posts that using the correct spelling will actually get you laughed at. One such word is the misspelling of the word ‘more’, “moar”. Moar has gained its popularity in many forums when one user posts something interesting or desirable to look at (usually links to [http://www.ivanafukalot.com '''porn'''], unsurprisingly) and everyone who responds after demands ‘moar!’"[http://blogs.dailyillini.com/opinions/2007/02/12/theres-moar-than-one-internet/]

==The Tao of Insults==
[[Image:Romani ite domum.jpg|right|thumb|UNCYCLOPEDIA GO HOME!]]
On [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] the biggest insult that can be leveled at an article is that "it ought to be on [[Uncyclopedia]]".

On [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|Uncyclopedia]] the biggest insult that can be leveled at an article is that "it ought to be on [[Uncyclopedia|Encyclopedia Dramatica]]".

For a discussion of which of the two Wikis is more [[unfunny]] and about the phenomenon of [[retards|elitists]] squabbling about [[shit nobody cares about]] see [[Wikipedia]]'s article about "The Judean People's Front", "The People's Front of Judea" and "The Popular Front of Judea" in their [[unfunny]] article on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_brian Life of Brian].<br><br>

==Internet Relevant Porn versus Not Internet Relevant Porn==



[[Image:Fakechloenude.jpg|thumb|center|200px|This nude picture of Chloe Sevigny has been skillfully photoshopped and is therefore Internet Relevant]]

[[Image:Realchloenude.jpg|thumb|center|200px|This nude picture of Chloe Sevigny has not ... God she's so [[hawt|gorgeous]] ... I can't be bothered to finish this caption as I'm off for a [[fap|wank]].]]

==How to distinguish between a "[[troll]]" and an "[[attention whore]]"==

[[Image:Science makes me horny.jpg|thumb|left|A troll]]
[[Image:Troll giant.jpg|thumb|left|An attention ho]]

In order to produce [[lulz|clucks]] for inclusioness in [[ED]] it is necessary to go to other websites and [[troll]] them.<br>
However this requires that you act like an [[attention whore]].<br>
Being a [[troll]] is good.<br>
Being an [[attention whore]] is bad.<br>
[[robot|Does not compute]]!!!111<br>
<br>
However, it's all in the [[unfunny|context]].<br>
<br>
Consider the following posting (note [[ALL_CAPS]]);<br>
<br>
{{quote|URGENT: ODB'S COMPY IS ON ITS DEATHBED. IF ANYONE HAS A MAC OR APPLE CONTACT WHO MIGHT HELP WITH THE EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT PRICE, PLOX 2 BE CONTACT ME HERE!}}<br>

If you posted this at [[Wikipedia]] or [[Uncyclopedia]] this would make you a  potential [[troll]].<br>
If you posted this at [[ED|Encyclopedia Dramatica]] this would make you an [[attention whore]].<br>
<br>
And remember - [[work|Arbeit]] macht Jew. <br>[[england|Cheers!]]<br>
