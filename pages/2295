Diva
A diva is any [[unwarranted self-importance|talented person]] either on [[IRC]] or [[IRL]]. A prime example of a diva is [[DivineAngel]], the [[lol-cow]] from the [[centipede-filled vagina]]. [[Snapesnogger]] is another example.


==How To Deal With A Diva==

[[Image:Divineangel_lolcow.jpg|thumb|right|A typical diva.]]

The only proper way to handle a diva, is to [[troll|leave nice comments]]. Upon receiving said nice comment, the diva will squeal in joy, only to discover that their [[Unrealistic Expectations|artwork]] was just [[flame]]d, much to the [[lulz]] of the [[awesome]] [[troll|Flame Warrior]]. The diva will then [[Snapesnogger|send their army of retarded fans]] to attack the [[troll|Flame Warrior]]. Sometimes, if the [[troll|Flame Warrior]] is really lucky, the [[DivineAngel|diva will hex them]].

==Similarities To [[Lol-cow]]s==

Divas share an extreme resemblance to [[lol-cow]]s. The reason being is that divas also carry the lulz gene, which makes them targets for [[lulz]] [[troll]]s. Some divas, however, get milked so frequently that they often become [[An Hero]]es. This is unfortunate, seeing as they are the prime source of lulz.
