"Raptard" is short for the source file called raptarded.jpg that is a forced meme. There have been well over 40 entries to the wanna-be meme so far. 

== THE CANCER BEGINS ==
On December 14th ([[Some argue]] it's the 13th) 2010, a jpg was making its way through [[/b/]] of a raptor that had a trollface. Later that day, a random [[MSPaint|Shit ms paint lineart]] of the same raptor started showing up after the original would be posted in a thread. The original had text under it asking "Problem?" to which the lineart replied with its own text saying "No".

== ORIGINS ==
From what has been gathered so far over /b/, the original comes from a game fanforum located [http://cosmicbreak.forumotion.com/forum.htm here]. The original trollface raptor was stolen off of this site by [[Your Mom|another member]] ('''Who did not make the image''') who then [[copypasta|copypasta'd]] it all over /b/. Then some other faggot made a lineart and the cancer spread. Apparently the lineart copy of the original was then '''copied again''' to which the "no" was removed and the overall image size was increased. Then threads started popping up with instructions and a link to that copy of the copy. The instructions went something like this. "I am a [[What|Penis Nigger]], please take this and shuv it up my anus for I crave for your massive dick". The actual instructions were more like "Take this and customize it so we can force it on /b/"... To which they did.
