Cycle of Blame
[[Image:blame.jpg|thumb|When a giant magical screw falls out of the sky and impales you, be sure to blame everyone who lives on a tiny globe.]]
When a wannabe [[e (prefix)|e-]][[detective]] blames all the usual suspects for an e-crime. 

==Process==
# The accuser cycles through a list of his perceived [[E-nemy|e-nemies]].
# One is picked at random.
#If accused is found guilty, end cycle until next e-crime takes place.
#If accused tries to defend his or herself:
##Suspect is automatically guilty, go back to step 3.
##Suspect is charged with an entirely new e-crime.
# If accused [[troll]] is proven innocent
## Return to step 2 and repeat ad infinitum.

The Circle of Blame requires sparse e-vidence and no legitimate evidence whatsoever. 

Any mention of previous false accusations will be ignored, and will cause the person who brought it up to be added to the accuser's e-blacklist.

==Basic Demonstration==
Undirect blames indirect; indirect blames undirect.  You should be blamed, but infortunately there was a musunderstoonding.  

==Argos' Axiom==
As the Cycle of Blame continues, the probability that [[ghostlight]] will be [http://www.frienditto.com/community/rant_about_cons/300069.htmlXthread=3999781#t3999781 named as a suspect] approaches one.
