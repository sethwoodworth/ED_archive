'''Cricket''' is a form of [[baseball]] played with only two [[drugs|bases]], the British inability to understand the complexities of baseball being [[colbert|well documented]]. Since most [[england|Brits]] are either too [[fat]] or [[alcohol|drunk]] to navigate a pitcher's [[vagina|mound]], British cricket pitchers are allowed to stagger in from [[sex|second base]] and throw either a red or white ball overarm like a [[girl]] or a [[W|brain injury victim]]. The traditional cricket pitch is as long as [[London|three London buses]] or a [[dinosaur|brontosaurus]] (whichever is longer) and in the summer games are extended into the evening with by use of [[history|candles and flaming pitchforks]].<br>
<br>
As documented in the [[Tomb Raider|Bollywood]] [[shit|masterpiece]] "Lagaan" all subject races of the [[The Royal Family|British Empire]] were forced to learn cricket. Starving villagers could either halve or double their taxes by playing [[gay|English public school]] cads with twirly moustaches, and in the famous match known as the [[300|Jallianwala Bagh Massacre]] England beat India by 90 British Army soldiers to 1,526 Indian casualties, a [[win|feat]] unsuppassed until a [[Muslim]] team pwned over 9000 at the [[WTC]] ground on 9/11. Hence the expression "wogs are beaten on the playing fields of Eton", the personal motto of [[David Cameron]]. A special form of cricket involving [[Ann Coulter|horses]], [[Sarah Palin|goat heads]] and [[gun|Kalashnikov]]'s is played in [[Afghanistan]], the game being won when a [[bitch|woman]] is [[pwn|stoned to death]] on the pitch before an enthusiastic audience of [[sick|Mullahs]] (nick-named "The Barmy Army").<br>

[[Margaret Thatcher|Norman Tebbit]], former [[racist|Heinrich Himmler]] of the Tories, proposed that once a [[azn|person]] has been identified as [[Nick Griffin|not white]], [[rape|their entry into the UK]] should be decided by [[chicken|their ability]] to answer the following <strike>three</strike> five questions;

*What is your favourite [[race|colour]]?
*What is the relative [[work]] rate of an [[Europe]]an swallow versus an [[Africa]]n swallow?
*Why wasn't the [[South Africa]]n team allowed to play international cricket in the 1970s?
*Explain the Offside Rule. (Trick question.)
*When a ball that isn't a no ball or wide passes the striking batsman and runs are scored without the batsman hitting the ball, is this called (a) a "Bye", (b) a "Good riddence darkie" or (c) a "Get back to the jungle"? (Multiple no choice.)

{{quote|I don't think it is exclusively a white sport. I mean the West Indians are black and they can play cricket well. The people from the Indian sub continent are good at cricket and like it to the point of it being a religeon. As far as non whites in Australia go though , you never really see:- Abbos, Asians and Maoris or Islanders out playing it though. Cricket isn't that much of a physical sport , I just think alot of the more "hot blooded races" would rather sports that are more fast paced.}} - [[yorkshire|Geoff Boycott]] [http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:ICsPwSSC3GAJ:www.stormfront.org/forum/sitemap/index.php/t-659132.html+cricket+white+sport&cd=7&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk&client=firefox-a]

{{quote|Lately, the talk of the internet is surrounding the Panama Women's Cricket team. No, its not because they won a major tournament or match, but all the talk is around the Panama cricket team '[[ass|booty]]'. This all seems to be a [[photoshop]]ping hoax which has everybody wired up for no particular reason.}}
