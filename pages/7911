Superbowl XXX
[[Image:Superpole sunday.png|thumb|210px|a [[penis]]]]
Ahh yes, Superbowl Sunday. What could be more [[American]] than drinking shitty beer while sitting on your ass and yelling at a [[television]] for hours on end, only to have a man's penis flap around on-screen at probably the most crucial point in the game? Nothing.

On Sunday Feb 1st, 2009 an [[admin|employee]] at [[Comcast]] decided that while this year's game between the [[Win|Pittsburgh Steelers]] and Arizona Cardinals may have been one of the best Superbowls evar, it was seriously lacking in the [[loldongs]] department. Like so many selfless [[an hero|heroes]] before him, he decided to take matters [[fap|into his own hands]], by way of splicing a clip from ''Club Jenna'' into the live feed.

It only lasted a moment and was only broadcast in and around the Tucson, Arizona area, but was still sheer [[win]]. The [[old media]] is calling the [[wambulance]] over what the [[internet]] would describe as a harmless dick-joke (but [[rly]], [[amirite|that thing wasn't very harmless it almost put her eye out]]). Comcast is reportedly faking an investigation to satisfy the [[concerned mother|morally outraged fucks]] who are no less the ones to blame for why Americans need to distract themselves with [[YouTube|mindless entertainment]] in the first place. 

On February 5th, 2011, Frank Tanori Gonzalez (The man responsible for Super Bowl XXX), was unfortunately arrested for [[wat|Hacking the Super Bowl.]][http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Arizona-man-accused-of-putting-porn-in-2009-Super-Bowl-broadcast-020411]
