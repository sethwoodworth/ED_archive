Le Sigh
[[Image:Cutekitten.jpg|thumb|Le Sighing is not limited to humans]]
'''Le sigh''' is often used in shitty conversation to imply a sigh for whatever random reason. People generally use it because they assume it makes them look interesting or intelligent, when in all actuality it makes them look like a moron, as most things [[French]] tend to do.  

This is an example of how "Le Sigh" is used in most conversations between peasants...

:[[Emo]] Prima: Woe is me.
:Secunda: What?
:[[Emo]] Prima: My life sucks... *le sigh*

Not to be confused with: le [[sic]].

Also used in the popular flash cartoon, [http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/end.php The End of the World].
