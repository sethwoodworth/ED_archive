Puppetkun AKA Puppetman is [[an_hero|an 15 year old]] and your local global mod (and furry) on the [http://www.midnafanforum.com Midna Fan Forum], where he spends his entire day [[roleplaying|roleplaying]] with his [[furry|friends]]. 

==Forum Life==

[[Image:Puppetsig.JPG|thumb|right|What the shit? Is this guy for real?]]

Puppetkun is a [[shit|wonderful]] moderator on the Midna Fan Forum. Appointed into place by his friend, Puppetkun proceeds to take full advantage of his moderating prowess by deleting and locking everything that doesn't agree with his views or he can't answer. If someone questions him, he locks himself away and bashes them with his [[life partner|boyfriend]] Savoc Sunlit-Hero, or makes assumptions on the person in question's behalf, because HOW DARE YOU QUESTION A [[fucktard|GOD]]?

Puppetkun is egotistical, and thinks he's one of the [[crap|best]] roleplayers under the sun. If you think otherwise, you need to [[GTFO|leave]] the boards now, because we will not be having this type of heresy. He currently has [[OVER 9000|OVER 9,000]] original characters, over half of which are not of the human race. But has never had [[lie|sex]] with any of them, because his penis is still in [[Truth|shrinkwrap]]

Puppetkun also shows signs of not being able to comprehend basic human language in the written form, taking everything wrong and even comparing masturbation to murder. He blames this fault on seeing his family members doing stupid shit to make themselves happy.

{{Quote|There is one thing that came to me as I read this. Just because something makes you happy, doesn't mean you should do it. If I loved to murder, and felt happy killing people, should I kill more? No! Of course not! Life isn't all about happiness. I'm not trying to offend anyone, but those are my two cents.|Because Masturbation is on equal terms with Murder}}

{{Quote|I'm sorry. It's just that I've seen my family and friends do REALLY stupid things in pursuit of happiness. My dad drank, my mom smokes, my friend asked five people to sleep with her when on marijuana (thank God her sister was there), and I've seen many horrible things happen in the name of happiness. I shouldn't have taken it out on you. I hope you can forgive me.|Puppetkun, bawwwwwwing <b>Note</b>: Where does this "friend" of his live?? Sounds more fun than he does LULZ}}

He also blames his massive mood swings on being [[self-diagnosed|Bi Polar]].  But in real life, we all know that a bunch of bullshit and that he's just [[Retard|retarded]] like most other Furries.

==Fur Faggotry==

Recently, Puppetkun has taken to introducing himself as "your local global mod and furry" to all new members that come to the board. His signature even states [[bullshit|"Furries > Normal Girls, IMO"]] (lawl)

{{Quote|I like this idea!|Puppetkun, admitting that he wants to [[rape|tenderly love]] a midna [[plushie|plushie]]}}

If you even hint that you dislike furs or don't understand the kink, Puppetkun gets massively [[butthurt|offended]], and demands to know an explanation for this [[faggotry|faggotry]]. He also calls you close minded, despite being a [[fundamentalist|Christian]] and closet [[faggot|bisexual]]. Puppetkun also adamantly denies that he's into [[bestiality|real animals]] or [[fursuit|fursuiters]].

{{Quote|Yeah, I guess I only go for softer things. Fur, feet, yuri... Although I do like some stuff that's a bit more out of the normal. I have a slight thing for [[vore|blood]], I like bestiality (to a point,) and a bit of dominance.|Puppet makes a convincing argument that he's not into [[rape|having sex]] with animals.}}

{{Quote|Oh, and since it's already been said, I also am attracted to dolphins. Woo. But no other animals.|Puppetkun, spreading the [[lies|truth]]}}

Puppetkun also admits that his [[sick|greatest]] fantasy is having [[gangbang|loving marriage]] with Flora, his favorite anthropomorphic cat girl. 

{{Quote|Flora would top my list. I wouldn't even want to sleep with her... Just to be with her... To cuddle... To kiss... To bask in her presence, to feel a deep and personal connection with her... To finally have someone to love and to love me... Companionship on a level like never before. Then (hopefully) marry her... Then sex.| Puppetkun, master of <s>contradictions</s> [[Rape|Accidental Sex]]}}

{{Quote|violence also turns me on... Gore, cannibalism, rape... Yeah, I make myself sick sometimes.|Showing signs of needing to be removed from the general population}}

Puppetkun is a [[pussy|pussy]] and cannot fight his own battles. When engaged in a battle of [[logic|wits]], his first response is to call upon his fellow mods to back him up. If they tell him he's fucked, he locks the topic like the [[failure|excellent]] mod that he is, in a move of [[communism|autocracy]]. Wouldn't [[Hitler|his idol]] be proud?

{{Quote|Yeah. Cardinair pwns all. :D|Puppetkun, pwning by extension}}

If it comes up that Puppetkun is in the wrong, he proceeds to mightily [[suck cock|kiss ass]] to moderators that are on equal standing, or higher in rank than him cause he doesn't want to get [[raped|on their bad sides]]

==Roleplaying==

Despite his massive ego, Puppetkun has shown on numerous occasions that he cannot write, and puts very little effort into doing so. He's quite popular with the [[men|ladies]] on the Adult Roleplay board. His character names are an amalgamation of words strung together that sound cool, but actually look as if they were yanked from a Silver Ravenwolfe book.

"Don't you want me to do anything?"|Puppetkun's furfag character, Observer, getting sucked off by some [[slut]]. Note the [[crap|overzealous descriptions]]}}

[[Image:PuppetAptitude.JPG|thumb|left|Displaying a vast knowledge of formatting.]]

Puppetkun is so obsessed with RPing that, in a display of his [[shitty|g0dly]] writing [[failure|skillz]] and creativity, he proposed an RP-fic, just so he could take all of the credit for coming up with such a [[shit|awesome]] idea.

{{Quote|(Who wants to write the first chapter? This is supposed to be like the three-word story, except you MUST BE SERIOUS! And self-insertion is allowed.)|Puppetkun attempts to show his superiority by showing a lack of creativity. I see what you did there}}

[[Image:Talentatitsfinest.JPG|left|thumb|1337 writing skillz]]

Not only does Puppetkun think he can write, he's also under the impression that his characters are [[emo|deep]] and [[fail|important]] to warrant a [[plskthx|demand]] for someone to [[waste|spend]] their day drawing his [[furfag]] characters.

[[Image:PKunsRPchar-stripedcopy.jpg|thumb|right|Shitty art he sucked major, throbbing cock to get]]

Puppetkun is under the impression that making fake Magic the Gathering cards constitutes as art.

[[Image:Gaaracard.jpg|thumb|left|Puppetkun displays his massive [[narutard|ninj4 skillz]] by putting the king of emo on a Magic the Gathering card]]

Puppetkun also pimps out his favorite online furry comic [http://www.2kinds.com Two Kinds] whenever their rank slips below the #1 spot, because we all know that everyone wants to read some [[shitty]] online comic about animals [[fucking]]. He's also a member of their forums, where he roleplays with other [[furfag|furfags]], and is attempting to suck enough cock to get moderator status. 

The TL;DR version?

Puppetkun is a gigantic {{Rainbow|Faggot}}
