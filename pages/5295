The word '''meme''' is a term coined by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his book ''[[Evolution|The Selfish Gene]]''. Originally used to describe packets of cultural information, it was adopted by the internet to describe viral [[lulz]] or [[Frunz]]. Its original meaning is [[old media|no longer used]] except by [[fags|sociology majors]].  In [[tl;dr|short]], memes are just inside jokes for people who have [[no friends]] with whom to have real inside jokes.

The word meme is commonly used by people who aren't [[4chan|retarded]] because it is in fact shorter to write the word "meme" than to write out "internet phenomena" or "something that will wind up on G4 tomorrow for all of the nerds to fap all over". [[some argue|It is well known]] that the only people that care about internet memes are [[i|sad fucks]] with [[Second Life|no life]]. In the [[Earth|real world]], the meme is known by its true name, "idea."

Sometimes [[blog|bloggers]] refer to memes as a word game or short [[quiz]] taken and posted as [[comment whore|comment bait]]. The more comments a user receives about their results the higher the chances are of that thing spreading.

You can bet your [[life]] that every meme you know [[Anti-lulz|hasn't been funny]] since about 20 seconds after its inception, which was approximately one billion years ago for all memes. This means you is dead crap and [[Internets|not cool]] because you weren't on the forum where "[[fail]]" was invented in 76 BC. Int4netzzFTWlykyea.

==Creation==
A meme cannot be created by any one person.  Every [[noob]] tries this [[over 9000]] times.  A meme, like the [[Herpes]] or [[AIDS]], is a gift to be shared, some cherished, but not some lame token of glory for some basement dwelling no life fag.  A meme is created by the reaction to, not the invention of, a subject (typically an image).  In fact, the best memes are created by accident and are the result of a particularly lulzworthy image being seen by the right people at the right time.

However, IF YOU MUST try to create a meme, try sharing something unique on [[/b/]] instead of gay ass [[advice dog]] knockoffs.

==Lifespan==
[[image:Meme-cycle.jpg|thumb|The meme is the final stage in the life of a butterfly.]]
[[Image:Howamemeismade.png|right|thumb|A meme is created via a [[series of tubes|complex system of pulleys and levers.]]]]
#A meme is [[Original Content|born]].
#[[The cancer that is killing b|Compounded overuse]] causes the meme to be burned into collective memory and [[aids|distributed]] across the internet.
#The meme reaches [[ebaumsworld|the bottom of the internet]].
#In some cases [[Tosh.0|the meme has gone even lower and surfaced IRL]].
#Those that gave birth to the meme are [[Troll's Remorse|filled with regret]].
#The meme lives on, spreading, and becoming more and more [[lolcats|dumbed down for a mass audience]], so that over time it bears little or no resemblance to the original.
#The meme is put on Snorg Tees and [[Facebook]] bumper stickers.
#Three to five years later [[Chuck Norris|it]] spontaneously resurfaces, makes its way to [[Uncyclopedia]], [[slash|slash-dot]] tags, and occasionally appearing on [[old media]] where if it has told no lies throughout its lifetime it finally becomes a real meme. During the final throes of an internet meme's slow and painful [[death]] it's visited by [[oldfags|old friends and family]] who, upon seeing the agony the meme is suffering simultaneously [[facepalm]] and hope the whole mess would just end already so they can clean out its room and have a place to put all the gym equipment.

<!-- STOP FUCKING ADDING ???? AND PROFIT! TO THIS SECTION YOU STUPID GODDAMN FAGOTS.  YOU DO NOT FUCKING NEED TO ADD THAT SHIT TO EVERY NUMBERED LIST ON SITE.  STOP FUCKING MISUSING AN ALREADY OVERUSED MEME.  SINCE YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY SEE THIS MESSAGE, ANYONE THAT FUCKING ADDS THAT TO THIS PAGE AGAIN IS GOING TO BE BANNED.  I'M FUCKING TIRED OF REVERTING THIS PAGE EVERY DAMN DAY BECAUSE RETARDS DON'T KNOW HOW TO EFFECTIVELY USE A FUCKING JOKE.  SHIT! 
-->

There are also [[forced meme]]s.  The idea behind a forced meme is that if you re-post something enough and pretend it's funny, it will eventually catch on.  They are an odd occurrence, and rarely succeed in becoming real internet phenomena, though.

<!-- just keep this list going and keep it short -->
Crappy, fast fading memes happen everyday.  Some examples include:

==Pronunciation==
[[Image:memes.png|thumb|right|Getting mathematical.]]
Perhaps one the most interesting aspects of the topic of memes is the pronunciation of the word itself.  Since the word meme is used primarily [[OTI]] in modern day, it's usually not spoken aloud.  Thus, a great deal of confusion has formed amongst the [[retarded]] masses of the Internets.  Very few people seem to know how it's properly pronounced, and idiots still argue (and probably always will) over how exactly one says the word meme.  Some possibilities:

*Meem (with a long e sound)
*Mee Mee (two long e sounds)
*Mām (long a sound, like the word maim)
*May May (two long a sounds)
*Mem (with a short e sound)
*Meh Meh (two short e sounds)
*Mehmā (the faux-posh like to think it’s pronounced ''Memé'')
*And any additional combination of the above sounds

Naturally, only one of these can be correct.  Of course, anybody with a handful of brain cells can come to the conclusion that all but one of them sound fucking retarded.  If you still can't figure out how it's pronounced, its the first one. Now that you know you should probably get back to being a loser and [[fapping|fapping]] at pictures of your [[loli|13 year old]] cousin, or [[an hero|what ever else it is you should be doing.]]

'''TL;DR:''' Anyone [[Asperger's_syndrome|kewl]] enough to try and say this shit IRL is fucking retarded. This includes Justin Bieber, nobros, your dad, anyone currently reading this and [[You|faggots in general]].
