'''Richard Marx Stallman''' is often referred to by his initials of "RMS".  RMS is moderately famous for the establishment of the [[Free Software Foundation]], and GNU (''GNU's Not Usable'') Software. His various projects (based out of the [[Nerd|MIT Media Lab]]) have essentially changed the software industry, and, along with [[Linus Torvalds]] (the original developer of the rampantly popular [[Linux]] knock off of [[UNIX]] and, as select others would argue, [[Shit nobody cares about|Minix]]), has suddenly gained a following. Of course, before Linus released Linux, his fame was close to null.

Now, RMS seems to spend his time avoiding soap and bitching that Linux should be called "GNU/Linux" since it "uses GNU software, and Linux is just the kernel." If RMS had actually spent more time working on projects like ''HURD'' instead of writing the ''GNU Software Manifesto'' he may have a right to bitch. Too bad ''HURD'' sounds so close to ''TURD''.

Since GNU/Hurd never worked properly, it has beed superseded by the [[GNAA]]/Hard as explained in this press release [http://pepper.idge.net/gnaa/gnaa-hard.txt]. 

In 2008, Stallman decided to take a break from raping [[13-year-old boy]]s and try to find his "[[unrealistic expectations|sweetie]]" on [[craigslist]] [http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/bos/533096562.html].

== Some RMS Lore ==
After getting his first degree at Harvard, RMS enrolled at MIT for his graduate work, but then he stopped studying and sort of hung around the place using their computers. He had an office on the 7th floor of LCS until he resigned in protest because all the other programmers in his lab were getting private-sector jobs and lives. But MIT let him keep his office, and he lives there because he refuses to have an apartment.

[[Image:RMS-Patachu-Yaoi-Rule34.png|thumb|RMS sure like gnus.]]
Anyway, RMS has or had a number of geek chick groupies. None of them could be called "hot", really -- well except for this one little psycho Jewish undergrad from NYC and (much to Spider-Man's annoyance) [[Whore|Kirsten Dunst]], an MIT undergraduate at the time. He would sleep with them on the sofa in his office. That's why he got kicked out of floor 7, and down to the 3rd floor: that the cleaning staff complained about pulling used condoms out from behind the sofas. You can use this information for [[troll|trolling]] if you wish, but it's all true.

RMS has a phobia of water that prevents him from showering. RMS has been observed taking a sponge bath in the 3rd floor men's room in LCS. Apparently once he had a girlfriend who he was totally in love with, and she convinced him to take one shower a week. It was a traumatic experience for him each time.

RMS also has a phobia of spider plants. When RMS starts bothering a grad student and going to his office and talking to him constantly and getting him to spend all his time writing free software, the grad student will complain to someone on the floor and they'll let them in on the secret: get a spider plant in your office. The next time RMS drops by, his eyes will bulge a little, and he'll say "Umm. . . I wanted to talk to you about hacking some elisp code . . . why don't you stop by my office sometime?" and make a hasty exit.

One of his more nasty habits is picking huge flakes of dandruff out of his hair while talking to other people. At least he doesn't eat them, like some [[User:wholesomedick|people]].

Now, everyone loves to make fun of RMS, but he really is a genius, on the order of Diogenes (another filthy slob who couldn't keep a normal living arrangement, so lived in a barrel) or [[Ghandi]] or Ezekiel. Everything he has ever said, while sounding naive, paranoid, idealistic and stupid at the time, turned out later to be correct.

The only thing to fear in his philosophy is his interest in reducing population growth. Everyone else who has been obsessed with that "problem" turned out to have fascist or totalitarian tendencies. On everything else, bitter experience has proved that he is right. It is generally wise not to use any non-[[GPL]]d or lGPLd software (with the exception of when you must actually get work done such as watching [[YouTube|videos of cats falling off beds]] or playing [[ghey]] [[World_of_Warcraft|games]]), and we can look forward to being able to buy only "open" hardware. <s>Software</s> patents could be completely eliminated, and with the development of digital communication, there is no reason why Congress shouldn't simply repeal all of Title 17 and do away with all copyrights. They just aren't needed. [[Libertarianism|Same goes for all the other laws.]]

The wannabe lawyer also hates [[Creative Commons]], because they allow flexible licenses rather than forcing everyone to use copyleft licenses. Even though most normal Creative Commons licenses allow non-commercial trade of licensed works, he criticizes them for supporting other licenses that do not. In other words, he only believes in supporting organizations that promote his choice, rather than supporting organizations that leave all choices open. JUST LIKE A NAZI.

People will be free to devote themselves to activities that are fun, [[nerd|such as programming]], after spending the necessary ten hours a week on required tasks such as legislation, [[incest|family counseling]], [[robot]] repair and [[science fiction|asteroid prospecting]]. There will be [[death|no need to be able to make a living]] from programming.|Stallman's manifesto. srsly.}}

==GPL v3==
By 2006 Stallman was fed up with all the attention being given to Linux and [[Eric Raymond]]. In an attempt to [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|grab the spotlight]] he released the third edition of the GNU General Public <s>License</s>Virus. The new version says that anyone can use GNU software however they want, unless it involves

* [[copyright]] enforcement
* [[drug]] prohibition
* interfering with [[Net Neutrality]]
* end-users
* [[Republicans]]
* personal hygiene
* [[profit]]!

Other than that, GNU software will remain [[lie|completely unrestricted]]. Any normal dude or dudette would just throw his sources somewhere on the net, without any license, as we all know GPLed software is being majorly ripped off and sold anyway, in which case h4x0rZ don't go to court anywayz. h4x0rZ don't like authorities and [[DDoS|solve things their own way]].

== The Free Software Song ==
[[Image:Haxorec40.jpg|thumb|300px|<s><u>''YES''</u></s>]]
RMS wrote and recorded an anthem to be the battle cry of the Free Software Foundation. 

*[[Media:Free-software-song.ogg|Why Cooperation With RMS Is Impossible]] 
Original recording of the song by RMS

The Free Software Song<br>
[To the melody of "Sadi Moma"]
<br>
''Join us now and share the software;''<br>
''You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.''<br>
(repeat)

''Hoarders can get piles of money,''<br>
''That is true, hackers, that is true.''<br>
''But they cannot help their neighbors;''<br>
''That's not good, hackers, that's not good.''<br>

''When we have enough free software''<br>
''At our call, hackers, at our call,''<br>
''We'll kick out [[GPL|those dirty licenses]]''<br>
''Ever more, hackers, ever more.''<br>

''Join us now and share the software;''<br>
''You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.''<br>
(repeat)


Melody of Sadi Moma, a Bulgarian dance tune.<br>
(Dash means previous note continues;<br>
there are seven beats per measure.)<br>

== Fame Amongst Illegal Immigrants ==
Mexicans had never heard of [[Retard|Richard]] or GNU before he visited them all on the Mexican border to America. He sang his song and it was an immediate success. This beautiful moment was captured on tape an released freely for everyone to enjoy.
<youtube>9sJUDx7iEJw</youtube>
[[LOL_WUT|"Join us hackers and you'll be free"]]; here, this twit demonstrates the difference between retarded no-life GNU "hackers" vs the original "h4x0rZ". No wonder Linux hasn't gone mainstream.

== Yum! Toe Cheese ==
Immediately after admitting to some embarrassing ignorance while answering a question pertaining to the scope of patent laws (a topic about which he's very concerned but apparently doesn't know much), RMS discovered a new form of nourishment that everyone (except [[amputee]]s, [[LOL]]) can enjoy.

As explained in the video comments, RMS was merely providing a [[bullshit|powerful illustration of the tyranny of social and hygenic norms]]. Go ahead, pick and eat the skin from your feet. Dinner is served!

==Copypasta==
[[Image:Copypastag.jpg|thumb|/g/ has trolled a computer talk show with the Stallman copypasta, in commemoration of Richard Stallman's obsession with calling Linux GNU/Linux.]]
<center><youtube>QlD9UBTcSW4</youtube></center><br />
[[Image:Copypastag2.jpg|thumb|Stallman copypasta in action]]
{| border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0
|[[Imma Let You Finish|I'd just like to interject for a moment.]] What you're referring to as [[Linux]], is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. [[Shit nobody cares about|Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.]]

Many computer users run a [[modding|modified]] version of the GNU system every day, [[Nobody Cares|without realizing it]]. Through a [[failure|peculiar turn of events]], the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by [[losers|the GNU Project]].

There really is a Linux, and [[basement dweller|these people]] are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the [[butthurt|so-called]] "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
