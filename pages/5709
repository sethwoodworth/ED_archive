Commonly known as ''"the second biggest [[lie]] [[EVAR|ever]] told"'' (right behind [[The Holocaust]] and just edging out [[Evolution]]), '''Net Neutrality''' is a buzzword that was invented by the [[fag|internet savvy]] masters of the [[internets]] to [[stick it in her pooper|pacify]] the bleeding-hearts [[16-year-old girl|stupid, liberal]] [[furry|furries]] who are [[noone cares|trying to make the world better by blogging about their opinions]].

While it is popularly told that [[Al Gore]] invented the [[series of tubes|Internet]], the only thing he ever invented was [[global warming]]. [[Al Gore]] is simply a [[bukkake|faceman]] for the [[Illuminati]].

The [[Illuminati]] and [[Jews]] [[do want|want]] [[Noone|nobody]] to know of their plots, lest the entire [[Disney|power base]] collapse.  This leads to [[KKK|hooded enforcers]] to make [[tea party|dissenters]] [[goatse|disappear at night]]. They have also awoken [[russia|sleeper agents]] in [[Ted Stevens|governing bodies]]. You may find it necessary to sleep with a [[Dildo|nightstick]] for [[rape|protection]].

Bandwidth throttling is [[a cat is fine too|another method]] perfectly [[asking for it|justified and ethical]] way to [[viking|battle]] [[bittorrent|t3h haxx0rz]] [[Mr. Hands|clogging]] up all the Internet [[tubes]] and [[lulz|threatening National Security]].  Notable cases include [[Comcast]] and [[cock block|Cox]].  Unfortunately, you need [[College|degree]] in [[Computer Science III]] to [[USB line|encrypt]] your [[pr0n|traffic]] and [[this is why we can't have nice things|prevent this]].

==Recipe for net neutrality panic==
* One [[Google|fucking huge internet content provider]] that wants to set up its own network
* One [[Comcast|fucking huge telecom]] that sells data, [[TV|Cable TV]], and [[telephone|telephone service]] on the same network cables
* Some vague and out of context quotations from the telecom company's CEO
* [[Over 9000]] obese [[basement dwellers]] who live in mortal fear of having to [[IRL|go outside]]

Combine into a massive [[lies|PR campaign]] to convince the [[basement dweller]]s that the content provider is a [[bullshit|helpless underdog]] that [[bawwwww|can't afford the telecom's rates]], and if [[government|Congress]] doesn't [[buy a dog|do something]] right away they will [[The Internet is serious business|LOSE THEIR PRECIOUS INTERNET OMG]]. Continue mixing until the [[FCC]] orders the telecom company to lease its network to the content provider for almost free, so that the content provider can use them in direct competition.

==The Conspiracy Against Myself==
As much as people love to [[whine|complain]] about this, what's been lost in the shuffle is how these companies are setting up for [[pwn|self-pwning]].

[[At least 100|Currently]], there are very few big ISPs and a several [[micropenis|small ones]].  The [[cock|big ones]] are big because they have bigger, more developed networks.  That's why they can [[jewgold|charge more]] for [[copypasta|services]].  With net neutrality removed, there will be a limit where you can go on the internet.  Essentially putting a sports car on a treadmill [[fritzl|in the basement]]. Sure, it still looks cool and goes really fast, but you're not going anywhere.  Meanwhile, the small ISPs will realize this new law only says you *can* charge for access, but you *don't have to* and they'll immediately have a major edge over the big ISPs.  End result, given the choice between being able to go where you want a little slower or go to a few places quickly, [[I see what you did there|most people are going with full access.]]  [[Communist|Hooray for the middle class!]]

[[Last Thursday]], the CEO of Virgin Media announced that he wasn't even going to pretend to maintain net neutrality.  Like a [[butthurt]] [[13 year old boy]], he said it was "[[buttsecks|bullocks]]" [sic] which gives him the right to sell our [[dickbutt|interbutt]] however he sees fit.  He plans to make sponsored sites load faster.  Obviously, the [[*chan|chans]] and [[ED]] will be forced to slow down for [[Eurotrash|Britfags]] now.

[[hawt|Bitch]] with [[tits]] says "net neutrality [[do not want|bad]]".

==[[TL;DR]]==
Some internet content providers are causing users to use more than 20% of the service they pay for and lowering [[profit]]s. This is a [[typical|classic]] example of the [[lawyer]] and accountants takeover.
===Old Internet (Net Neutrality) = You pay for what you use.===
*You pay ISP/BACKBONE to download/upload to internet content providers.
*Internet content providers pay ISP/BACKBONE to download/upload to users.
*Not a big truck.
===NO Net Neutrality =  We all pay twice===
*You pay ISP/BACKBONE to download/upload to internet content providers.
*Internet content providers will have to charge you for usage.
*Internet content providers pay ISP/BACKBONE to download/upload to users.
*Internet content providers pay ISP/BACKBONE to compensation for causing users to use more than 20% of the service they pay for.
*Not a [[series of tubes]].
'''ISP/BACKBONE win because it's the law.'''
