DotA
[[Image:Dota_loading.jpg|thumb|The dota load screen, it contains cleavage to help attract the nerds.]]
'''Defense of the Ancients''', or DotA, is a custom game for ''Warcraft 3'' that is used to wean ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' addicts from their habit, but eventually becomes habit forming itself, similarly to how methadone was used to cure [[heroin]] addiction. Although DotA is one of the most [[Lie|popular]] games today, playing it is like rolling around in shit while doing [[Jack Thompson|Jack Thompson's mom]], disgusting,unpleasant and downright shitty.

==What is DotA?==

Think ''Warcraft 3'' but instead of controlling an army you control a single character and your army runs towards the enemy as if they are bored with life and you can't do shit about it. The game primarily consists of you killing the mindless drones on the opposing force to gain experience and gold, using that gold to buy items for your character and using the experience to learn and upgrade abilities. Hopefully your character will become strong enough to defeat the opposing characters so you can destroy their base. To its credit though playing DotA is like a complete [[MMORPG]] experience in thirty minutes however this is also a bad thing because despite the fact it doesn't consume your life it still feels like you're playing [[WoW]].

==The shit that DOTA truly is==
[[Image:DOTA_FFFFFUUUUU.jpg|right|400px|thumb|FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUU]]
DotA is not only maybe the most boring game ever, but is the ONLY map that most of the population on Warcraft 3 plays. As a matter of fact, one thing that's a lot more fun than DOTA is the "how few DotA games can you find on the screen at once after refreshing game." To do this, you simply click refresh, and then watch as 80% or more of all the maps that show up are DotA.

Moar reasons that DotA is shit areâ€¦
#It's like WoW. Playing a game that's LIKE WoW is like jerking off to n00d picz of girls that LOOK under 18.
#It's not newfag friendly.
#There's [[Michael_Jackson|gay shit]] everywhere.
#OMG <s>CLINKZ</s> <s>TECHIES+ALCHEMKIST</s> GENERAL PROUDMOORE BOAT THROWINGNESS OMGOMGOMG IS RIGGED!@!@!@!@!@!@!@!@
#Along with every other new character in the past 5 versions...
#People use blinkstrike to run away from Proudmoore!
#Just trying to learn to play is like ROFLSTOMPING your self respect because you're a fuck if you are full of n00b
<br><br>

==DotA and blame-shifting==

[[Image:Retard.jpg|thumb|Typical DotA player - Trypanosoma]]

A favorite pastime of 95% of DotA players is to make excuses when they get [[owned]], in a pathetic attempt to shield themselves from the harsh reality that their own shortcomings have just been exposed for the world to see, and to try to maintain what little crumbs the other players probably never held in their minds that the dead player in question is in fact, a good player at all. Excuses are many, ranging from "lag", to "LAAAG" to "LOL I WASN'T WATCHING (tharfore surely i wud have owned yuo)", or another favorite one "Where was my team! What you guys doin?!?! Yall jackin off over there or what?!" On top of this, dissatisfaction often manifests itself amongst some players regarding their inability to do jack shit but sit there and take a fat Blademaster cock up the ass when they get raped by ownage combos, usually in the form of post-death mockery such as "i can push one buttens and get kills WOOO". In this example, "WOOO" is the noise of a child uncontrollably shitting its pants and crying.

In many cases especially in the [[Philippines]], people who become "PROS" in this so-called "game" turn out to be [[n00bs]] in real life. Infact ask a regular DotA playing Flip to a video game challenge that dosen't involve [[Counter Strike]] or DotA(For added drama, ask him to play a regular skirmish game of Warcraft III) and he will most certainly loose to you on the spot mainly because Counter strike is the only other game the retard would play.

Many variations of the DotA map exist. Some maps cater to [[Narutard|Narutards]]. Others, like Tides of Blood, cater to fuckwits with a scatological sense of humor

==DotA players==

The average DotA player is not only a [[retard]], but a nerdy [[Azn|azn]], he is also usually a [[fucktard]] and a [[Gay|homo]] who sucks cock everyday. They have usernames such as [[Pedophile|Iluvlittleboys223]],[[Michael Jackson|M1(H43L _|]] and [[Arsehole|Iamtehsuxxorz365]], [[Goatse|GapingChasm]].

The DotA community is somewhat reminiscent of the ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' community and I'm not just talking about how members of both communities seem to never get bored of playing the same map over and over.  Both communities are full of people who play no other video games and obviously don't think the game is fun at all, the only reason they keep playing is because they are one of the rare few that actually stuck at it long enough to get consistent results and now they have no other life to go back to so the game becomes their everything: their source of social interaction, their source of accomplishments and the source of the illusion that they are actually doing something with their lives. DotA players should not be classified as human beings.
Many DotA players play this game because they are too slow to handle FPS's.

Basically this means that when you play DotA that if your team is losing you can expect to flamed by the [[loser]] who's sole purpose in life is to [[pwn]] at DotA.

==Effects of playing DotA==

One of the dreadful effects of watching or playing DotA is the reduction of [[At least 100|a bit]] of your IQ. Another is a slow, horrible death due to internal hemorrhaging. It is also known that your head can explode due to the sheer retardation level and shittiness of the game.   

[[Image:Youch.jpg|thumb|One of the effects of watching a game of DotA.]]

Those whose minds are simple/retarded/stupid enough to somehow TAKE the overall shittiness will have their minds liquefied into a fine goo and transformed into an addict, which is why most DotArds play their shitty game 24/7.

==DotA and noobs==

[[Image:Dota_heroes.jpg|thumb|I'm not kidding there are fucking heaps of heroes and the list just keeps growing.]]

As stated above DotA is not newfag friendly, this isn't because the game is near impossible to master properly (like [[Pacman]]) but rather it is completely and totally over complicated. In DotA, there are roughly <s>eighty</s> one hundred characters each with their own stats and unique abilities and almost as many items.  To make matters worse in order to actually acquire good items you have to merge items together in what they call a "recipe" which causes the simple decision of choosing an item to increase your agility to take 60 seconds or longer which adds up because you have to keep buying items or you will get [[pwned]] [[hardcore]].  

This complicated system results in literally [[over 9000]] different combinations. One would expect that you could simply stick with a handful of characters you actually like but you'd be wrong, the people who obsess over DotA get a great deal of pleasure reminding you of how their mastery is far superior by choosing the "all random" mode which means you could be playing as any of the eighty characters available and to make matters worse all the [[Basement_dweller|"hardened"]] DotArds expect that you have had extensive experience with all characters and memorized all item and ability related documentation.

In the event you are unable to live up to the standards of the [[Asshole|benevolent]] [[nerds|veterans]] you can expect to be slandered and mocked at every turn. Eventually word will get around about how much you suck so you can expect to be instantly booted from any DotA games you try and join which will prevent you from gaining any useful experience leaving you no choice but to become [[an hero]] (or go back to ''[[Halo]]'', but who wants to live with that kind of shame?).

==DotA and Leagues==
DotA has many leagues in which people play dota very... very... seriously.  These are some leagues you can register for, google their websites to register this will enable to troll on a whole nother level.

Clan gdg
Clan Syn
Clan dxd

/profile Result for more dxd leagues.

The key to trolling such a league is you can flame, troll, talk shit as long as you don't do certain cardinal things I will lay them out here to facilitate trolling:

* Do not destroy items of yours or your teams as this will result in you being shitlisted
* Do not TK your team obviously
* Do not go afk for more than 5 minutes
* Do not do worse than 0-7/0-8

Things you can do easily:

* Buy retarded or illogical shit
* Play terribly
* Rice in the jungle
* Pretend you don't speak English etc.

Trolling a dota league is far more fun than trolling a public(pub) DotA game!

==Trolling a DotA Game==

[http://osakawutan.livejournal.com/519.html An in-depth guide]

The sole reason to play this game (other than that of being a [[loser]]) is to [[troll]] it. Seeing as how anyone who plays this game only has a [[basement_dweller|life in it]], you can expect any and every other player of this interwebbz game to go COMPLETELY FUCKING PSYCHO every time they see a n00b or a troll. Heaven forbid someone will ruin a perfectly good game for them!

Trolling a DotA game is simple and lulzy.  All you need to do is go into a game that says "DOTA NO NOOBS" or "DOTA PROZ ONLY" and act like the noob fuck that you are.  Not only does this piss off everyone else in the game, but it means they have to express it with swears, flames, and [[win|the host has to remake the game from the very beginning, resulting in a huge waste of time]]. You can also join games that are nearly full, after typing that you're ready, and that you're not a noob, wait for it to start. A countdown will start , and before the host can react (preferably at the 1 second mark) press ESC for massive lulz. If you failed to leave the game in time, fear not! Your trolling options have only expanded.

Other things you can do:
* Pick Holy Knight and cast Test of Faith on allies non stop.
* Pick Bloodseeker and cast (level 1) Bloodrage on allies non stop.
* Pick Pudge and cast Hook on allies non stop.
* Pick Prophet and cast Sprout on allies non stop.
* Pick Clockwork Goblin and cast Power Cog near allies.
* Pick Bane Elemental and cast Nightmare on allies non stop.
* Pick Faceless Void and cast Chronosphere on allies when ranged enemy heroes are near by.
* Pick Proudmoore (moar liek [[Buttsecks|Poundmoar]], [[amirite]]?) and cast X Marks The Spot when they're running away. 
* Pick Tiny and toss their ass into a group of fags.
* Pick Vengeful Spirit, run into an enemy group, then use Nether Swap on an ally.
* Pick Keeper of the Light save enough gold for a blink dagger, blink into a place no one can get to or get out of your Ultimate Spell then cast Recall, which teleports people to you. Watch as they rage that they cant move.
* Pick Pitlord, buy boots of travel teleport around and take all of the creeps denying your allies gold, train your ultimate ability use it when standing near your allies and teleport them back to your base, over and over again, buy a referesher to do it faster.
* Pick Drow Ranger and don't get Ice Arrows or Silence, but get Helm of Dominator
* Pick Antimage and don't get Mana Break but get Helm of Dominator
* Pick Zeus and do nothing but [[Kill Steal]] all game long
* Pick Pudge and cast Rot till you die, say "n00b host"
* Pick Magnus, buy lots of Tangos and a Quelling Blade. Now move to the lower right corner of the map. Hack yourself through the trees until you are in the corner of the map. Cast Skewer in direction of the map's borders. Magnus will completely disappear from the map - the next move you do with Magnus will [[Lulz|crash]] the game [[for great justice]].

Unfortunately many of these tactics can be prevented by an [[fag|experienced player]] who is aware of the "-disablehelp" command. Thus another and more effective way (as it means you don't have to bother leaving your current game and entering a new one) is by simply clicking on Menu (top of screen) and then "Save Game". This is superior to pausing the game, as saving the game means [[ninja|NOBODY KNOWS IT WAS YOU]].
Saving the game results in every other person's DotA game freezing as it is for 20-30 seconds or so, depending on the latency rate of other people; however the best aspect of this method is that the title you use when saving the game will become the name of a file in all players save folder and, since most players are unaware of this, it might be years before they find out. Pick your title wisely for maximum trolling power.

In a sad, pathetic attempt to reduce the amount of drama in DotA games, Many hosts claim to use a banlist that will INSTANTLY BLOW UP YOUR COMPUTER AND GIVE YOU AIDS the second you leave a game. Aspiring trolls need not worry though, because 99% of people screaming "LEAVERS WILL BE BANNED" don't have one in the first place, and because banlists don't do shit anyway since no one took the time to make one that doesn't completely suck.  In reality, Banlist is for [[n00bs]] that can be gotten around by anybody just by simply making another account.

Still not happy with the amount of trolling you've done?  Feel free to add a host or [[Tourneyfag|SERIOUS PLAYER]] to your friends list and continue to talk shit. While spamming a player will quickly get squelched or temp-b& from WC3, shit talking with at least decent grammar is bait that every DotA player needs to bite. Talk about how they were the worst fucking dragon knight you've ever seen.  Make fun of their score, their level, or anything game related. Stay clear of personal attacks or anything a [[13-year-old boy]] would write, they'll just ignore you.  However, if you DARE TO FUCKING MAKE FUN OF THEIR PLAY STYLE, [[Internet tough guy|OHHHHHHHHHH YOU'RE IN FOR IT NOW!!!!!]]

==All Pick Easy Mode==
All Pick Easy Mode (-apem) is the most common state of affairs you are likely to find yourself in if you participate in the [[furfaggotry]] that is [[DotA]]. [[Trolls]] should avoid this mode at all costs, as its games usually consist primarily of [[trolls]]. Many [[Furfag|Dotafags]] have argued that playing this mode makes you [[Ayn Rand|a bad person]], but this is mostly because [[Furfag|Dotafags]] implicitly add 'at DotA' to any judgment they make about anyone. If you are forced to play [[DotA]], beware of being [[pwnt|lulpwnt]] by quadriplegic infants on Easy Mode. Icefrog has designed it specifically in order to facilitate the largest number of [[Dracoguard|whining sessions]] ever recorded on the [[internetz]], and has been widely applauded for this decision.

==DotA and the least cool music video ever==

Swedish [[homosexual]] [[Swede|Basshunter]] wrote a [[techno]] song about DotA which somehow managed to get high in the charts of backwards countries like [[Denmark]].  According to [[Some_Argue|some people]] Basshunter is very [[Gay|famous]], although no one outside of his home town has ever heard of him.

'''NOTE:''' It is delightfully fitting that "Basshunter" has decided to portray himself as living at home with his mother in this video.

== DOTA clans ==

People form DOTA clans when they get tired of playing with [[pub trash]] and [[scrubs]].  Unfortunately, even with clans like TDA that require safelisting or icon, or THR which requires ELO over 1000 to get into Tier 2 games, this does not eliminate scrubs.  

*TDA Where the Sentinel is 99% of the time a stacked team of friends
*THR -where anyone with their [[ELO]] less than 1000 is a [[n00b]]
*NEs (defunct) Used to spam Clan TDA in fits of nerdraeg
*MYM Also accused of spamming both TDA and THR  channels [[for great justice]]
*DXD (defunct) Imploded when people figured out Banlist is worthless


==<i>League of Legends</i> samefaggotry==

As of [[Last Thursday|10/29/09]] it has been annouced that DotA is it's own game. The game being named, <I>[http://leagueoflegends.com| League of Legends]</i>. 

Imagine the freakish one-night stand between [[World of Warcraft]], drunk off his ass, and the sopping wet cunt of DotA. The result of such anal play is League of Legends, a festering anal wart that will haunt "Guinsoo" and "Pendragon" to their graves. It is basically a polished up version of dota, only with a [http://www.leagueoflegends.com/learn/learning_center set of tutorials for the newfags].

Here some sweet fucking things you can do in League of Legends:

* Download it, play it and uninstall it FOR FREE!
* Participate in games ranging from 25 minutes to MORE THAN AN HOUR! Enemy team got ya down? Getting fisted right to the shoulder? The client ties your account's ID to every game you join so if you try to quit and play another, YOU GO RIGHT BACK TO IT!
* Use points you earn in games to purchase new champions! Don't even think about saving up for skins 'cause you have to buy RRRRRRIOT POINTS for that! Cunts!
* Level up through the ranks! Invest points in talents! Buy the extra 0.02 HP rune because that's the ONLY REASON you aren't winning at your skill level!
* Purchase champions from the store and pick from ten free ones EVERY WEEK! But seriously, you and I both know you will suck at any one you pick. This is the game Koreans play with one hand and punish the slightest error with total e-rape, forcing you to focus your energy on a single champion to get good. Then a day comes where, by the wind of luck, you will TOTALLY FUCKING PWN. Waves of monsters will fall at your feet, enemy heroes will quiver in fright and your allies will tongue your testicles. However, this surge of e-peen will melt to a string of losses and butthurt as you try to explain zero assists and constant feeding. Yeah, I'm sure that build got you a legendary streak last game. Maybe you should stick to playing against AI bots and phone us when you're ready for some teamwork.
* GET ADDICTED! League of Legends has all the enticing elements of WoW! Collect enough gold to buy the black phallus you've been eying! Shit the same ball of magic on the same goddamn monster for the fucking thousandth time! Masturbate over one character and die inside when the Infinity Edge you farmed for vanishes at game's end! Now you can have the life sucked out of you in thirty minutes or less, GUARANTEED!

LoL was created by <i>Riot Games</i>, a group of DotA [[fantards]] from around the globe willing to make goals such as pioneering 
the game genre, <i>Multiplayer Online Battle Arena</i>.

==''Heroes of New-URFF''==

S2 Games, fresh out of ideas for almost seven years, decided to cash in on the "session based multiplayer action RPG game" crop. Having produced two other games based around their mystical [[Faggotry|faerie world Newerth]], they decided to crank out a DotA clone based on the same dull world. S2 offered IceFrog an ass-ton of money so he would give them pointers on how to fuck up their game beyond all recognition. He said, "Sure, why not? I'll be going to Valve anyway so [[Truth|you'll be bankrupt and giving blowjobs in a year.]] Might as well shoot yourselves now, faggots, 'cause I'll be the one wrapping a twenty around my cock." [[Fanboys]] misinterpreted this as "ICEFROG DEVELOPED HON, SO DOTA 2 CAN'T BE BETTER! LOL FAGS!" Thus, ''Heroes of Newerth'' was <s>born</s> cloned.

''Heroes on Newerth'' boasts many [[Recoloring|original fucking concepts that sets it apart from the other DotAs]]: 
* [[Fap|Connect and re-connect all day long!]]
* Pick it up now for only $30.00! That's half the price of [[StarCraft II]] [[Lie|for twice the amount of fun!]]
* Voice chat is incorporated ''into the fucking game!'' Now you can hear your fat teammates wheeze as they call you a dripping cunt for the thousandth time!
* If you don't have the balls to take people hating you, either take the suggestion mentioned in ''every single forum'' post and leave, or else take the other suggestion and [[an hero]]. The only response by the community would be [[lulz]].
* Play unbalanced heroes on a map so choked with shadows that [[RAPE|you won't see the band of niggers coming to bid you "good day!"]]
* [[Over 9000|Over 30,000]] players, making it more popular than food, sex and WoW combined!
* Once you are [[orgy|part of the community]], you will become [[dick|addicted]] to saying the phrase [[azn|"''HoN''"]]! [[Batshit insane|Coolest]] community in teh world!
* Begin every forum post with "I like how..." about things you hate.

== DotA 2 ==

[[Last Thursday]], [[Valve]] kidnapped Icefrog and raped him until he agreed to DotA 2. It is to be released in 2011 but in typical Valve fashion it will be delayed for two centuries as they fuck jars of peanut butter instead of working on the game.

DotA 2 will boast all 100+ heroes (so they say) and stay true to the original action-RTS framework. This will, of course, make all previous versions of DotA defunct. Waves of faggots will abandon LoL and hurr durr as Riot Games slips into bankruptcy. Pendragon will QQ and Icefrog will demand a rimjob.
