[[File:MSUntitled.png|thumb|[[Serious Business]] ]]
'''MapleStory''' is a [[shitty]] 2D [[anime]]-style [[MMORPG]] originally developed by the [[Good Korea|South Korean]] company [[shit nobody cares about|Wizet]]. Eventually, Nexon, another South Korean company, merged with Wizet, and their American branch took control of Global MapleStory (a.k.a. Maple Story for [[Americunts]]). Think of an unholy cross between [[Gaia Online|Gaia Online]], [[Mario]], [[You|everything evil ever to be included on the internets]], and any other color- and anime-overdosed game.  Arguably the most popular F2P game in the world, and as such the player base constantly argues with the [[Ragnarok Online]] fans over which [[The Game|game is better]], which is complete [[bullshit]] because [[Truth|we all know every MMO game sucks.]]

MapleStory is infamous for a wide variety of reasons, but to sum it up in a sentence, it would be "the same problem Wikis suffer from, in that ''anyone'' can be a contributing member."  As MS was arguably the pioneering free-to-play MMO, it soon became the staple argument for "why free things in life suck, particularly free MMO games."  With [[AOL|access given to any moron with a computer and a working Internet connection]], [[No|was it any surprise?]]


==Community==

To begin with, one of the worst parts of MapleStory is undoubtedly the community.  MS holds (or rather, held, in a sense) the honor of being the only F2P game whose influence reaches across the world, and thus has <s>what [[some argue]] is</s> proven to be the worst MMORPG community ever, even worse than that of [[EVE Online]], [[World of Warcraft]] and [[RuneScape]] which are all inhabited by the lowest forms of life in the universe anyway.

What started as a relatively small community of average [[NORP]]s grew into a morass of illiterate, drooling [[Wapanese]] [[fucktards]] as [[The Game|the game]] became popular.  99% of MapleStory players suffer from severe levels of [[unwarranted self-importance]], as well as being generally gullible, brainless, and aggressive enough to make the average [[World of Warcraft]] player flinch.  Keep in mind that 90% of MS players are obnoxious [[13-year-old boy]]s but without exception all MS players are [[Truth|mentally handicapped]] - [[truth|fuck, ALL MMORPG players are mentally handicapped]] - which explains everything mentioned so far.  Many MS players are even willing to spend [[IRL]] [[Jew Gold|money]] on [[The Game|the game's]] useless Cash Shop items, cementing their lack of contribution to mankind in stone.

Not only all of that shit, but you can also get married to someone you just met online. Yes, you heard me, you get married in this sad-ass excuse for a game by spending basically $10 to show everyone in this hell-hole that your "SUP3R SPESHUL" while all you get is a bunch of faggy looking hearts flying around your dick. Plus your spouse is probably a guy IRL, as there are no girls on the internet.

The best case scenario for these gelatinous whiny fucktards is making <s>themselves</s> their [[Whore|parents]] bankrupt from spending their hard earned cash on absolutely fucking useless [[shit]]. The worst case scenario for them is to gracefully commit [[An_hero|hara-kiri]] in order to restore hope back to the human race. They slowly and monotonously click away at monsters gaining minuscule points wasting their life away like the scum they are. Anyone with a properly functioning brain knows not to play this game.

{{Hover|Not a day goes by on MapleStory where there isn't a microphone spammer making his brainlessness obvious to mankind (Let's face it. Most are just as stupid as him/her)|Theres no vocal chat in maplestory, retard}}, or [[drama]] in between guilds, or even [[lulz|guild infighting]].  This carries over to the equally stupid forums and fansites that have sprung up from this beast.

And worst of all, ''MapleStory undoubtedly holds the highest concentration of [[Wapanese]] of any MMO in the world''.  Yes, moreso than [[Ragnarok Online]], [[World of Warcraft]],  [[Everquest]], or any of those other piles of [[Bullshit|crap]].

All of this points to (and simultaneously stems from) the fact that, of course, '''MapleStory is [[serious business|serious fucking business]].'''

There are those who dare to play this game without buying stupid  virtual clothing, but the 99% of the population that aren't faggots begging for "MESARS PL0X" will attempt to run the people who aren't fucking stupid out of the game.

In short, ''the "community" makes [[4chan]] look like college graduates with Ph.D's''.  Even [[Ragnarok Online]] private server communities have better people than this (though that isn't saying much).

And it all contributes to the cesspit of shit and waste that is the game itself.

==Game==

# Hold a key.                                        
# [[????]]                                          
# You are now a piece of shit.

[[Srsly]], [[Truth|that's what you'll be doing the majority of the time]]. Being 2D, the only thing you'll ever be able to do is stand next to a monster, hold whatever the fuck key your attack is on, and watch the screen like a [[retard]]. And stare at the screen at the screen you will, because it takes a long fucking time to level up. The highest level is 200, but [[Ragequit|almost nobody reaches it]] because it takes [[over nine thousand]] hours to reach that. No, [[seriously]], [[Loser|10,000 hours is a generous estimate]].

[[Billy mays|BUT WAIT, THERE'S MOAR]]!!1

As you sit on your naked, fat ass, waiting for your level up which is hours away, you will encounter a variety of [[faggots|shitheads]] sooner or later. There are always [[at least 100]] [[script kiddie|script kiddies]] waiting to hax up your map, and all of them will no doubt flame you on how "ur dmg sux", [[Azn|"ur eyes rnt slantd liek mines"]], etc. 
[[Image:maplesrory.gif|right|thumb|Maplefags actually believe their [[Asperger's Syndrome|super pourz]] will help them in forums and irl.]]

Then there's a whole army of Mexican [[retard|retards]] who will spam the shit out of you, until either you give them [[sperm|"100 sqishy liquidz@@@@@@]], or they get [[V&]] for smuggling crack via their sister's [[asshole]].

Also, be aware that there are '''no''' girls in MapleStory. If someone with a name like "lilaznqtx3" starts asking to be your [[whore|gf]], sign off, close and lock all windows and doors, [[buy a dog]], etc. <s>It's the [[pedobear]], and he's looking for some fresh [[ass]].</s> First, it's Pedobear, not ''the pedobear''. Second, Pedobear is only into [[loli]]. Get your facts straight, [[newfag]].

[[DO NOT WANT|DO NOT]] play this if you happen to be one of the following:

*'''A PETA member.'''  Maple Story requires [[you]] to get over your [[cunt|ovaries]] and fucking kill [[shit|baby seals]] to get [[shit|money]] to buy [[shit|a larger, better knife that slices through them like butter]]. Yes. Baby Seals.
*'''A God fearing Christian''' Maple story is constantly filled with weeaboo faggots that mainly worship [[Naruto]], for great faggotry. A majority of these players will be the assassin class, who will always KS you and call you a [[noob]], just for being on their channel while they are grinding to [[Linkin Park]].
*'''People with fucking money.'''  Maple Story [[noobs]] have the tendency to falsely report your ass to the game mods because they think you hacked the game just to get blue hair.  
*'''Anyone with common sense.'''
*'''Anyone who has a life.'''
*'''Anyone who is not a complete and utter douchefuck.'''
*'''[[Curly]]'''

==Maple Kombat==

A Maple Story gay porn series made by a nigger mage, who apparently is an attention whore and bawwwwws when JewTube mutes his non-copyrighted porn songs UNTIL he decides to cut the gay porn music and re-uploads it for the 18th time.

Perfect example
<youtube>9J2kmq5aF0w</youtube>


Let's all take a look at the comments of the video.
Full of Nexon whore comments and bad grammared shit.

==Maplers on JewTube==

If you ever make a shitty maplestory video [[shit|(MMV)]] you will get spammed with 5/5s and suck-up comments by 16 year old whores(maybe even 13 fags). In short, its just a bunch of whores who make shitty videos with the camera basically moving to the left and playing their faggy music.

Perfect Example of this faggotry

'''Notice: all of the following class related information will ''always'' be outdated (especially after the [[Cataclysm|Big Bang]] patch) because Nexon rebalances all of the skills for each class every other month because either making your shitty character either weaker or god-like so unless [[You|someone with no life]] wants to go through the trouble of keeping track of all of the changes it's not gonna be updated with the exception of the 10 new jobs Nexon likes to throw in every year.''' 

===Admin===

They don't fucking exist, lol.

The [[Fail|powerful]] GMs don't [[I'm so confused|know anything about running an MMO]]. They don't really do anything, all they care about are people who shout "GMS ARE F@GS", who they swiftly ban while hackers run amok. 

Once [[at least 100|every 100 years]], GMs will hold special [[circle jerk|"events"]] where maplers can compete against each other on teams or solo for incredibly shitty prizes. These happen so rarely, some people will go their whole maple life without seeing an event (or even a GM, since they're too busy being invisible in the woman's sauna, jacking it).

There was a brief time where GMs went on a fucking [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|banning spree]] and it seemed they were getting some work done. After the next patch, the hackers returned, and the GMs went back to being lazy assholes.

===Beginner===
Now here is a class that truly deserves getting raped in the ass (Yes, all of them deserve this but this one really needs a good buttfuck). The worst class of all; even worse than a fucking bowman. You start on the noob island with weak-ass weapons, such as knives, clubs, and purses (further proof of faggotry: male characters can equip purses as weapons). You use them to attack beginner mobs like snails and [[drugs|mushrooms]]. Beginners get 3 shitty skills: speed boost for 10 seconds, health recovery for 10 seconds, or throw some snail shells for damage. People who are a beginner and are over lv20+ are either mules, or idiots who think they're cool for leveling up with no skills or good weapons/armor. They are known as [[retards|super-beginners]] or [[basement dweller|maple islanders]] (the beginning map's name). People even waste enough time to get to about level 120 or so with this class. They are known as [[fucktards|idiots]].

===Warrior===
All warriors are meat-shields in the [[game|game]] and require [[dumbass|no intelligence]].
[[Image:warrior.jpg|right|thumb|I R STRONG!!1! LOLOLOL suk ma balls!!!!]]
'''Fighter'''
*You fuck shit up with your [[dick|long sword.]]
*Advance to [[gay|SUPER FIGHTER]]!
*Have shitty abilities such as "Roar" which hits/stuns [[liek]] the entire map. There is no reason to use this skill, other than to piss off some other douche bags.
'''Spearman'''
*You stab things with [[penis|long pointy objects]]. 
*Advance to [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|Dragon]] Knight. 99% of [[faggots|warriors]] are DKs.
*Able to survive longer due to [[steroids|health-increasing abilities]].
'''Page'''
*You smash things with [[cock|blunt weapons]].
*Has control of the elements, but still manage to have shitty damage.
*Advances to, ah, who cares, pages suck cock.

===Thief===
[[99.9%]] of thieves are [[13 year old boy|13 year old boy]] [[narutard|Narutards]]. They think dressing in all black, or even in some cases cosplaying as Naruto (yes, there are items made to look like Naruto's outfit as well as Rukia/Renji from [[Bleach]]), is so fucking sweet, [[gay|Dattebayo]]! 
[[Image:sin.jpg|right|thumb|DO I LOOK COOL?!!?]] 
'''Assassin'''
*They are thick-headed retards who jump around and use kunai and throwing stars as weapons.
*Usually named [[gay|xXaznsin666Xx]] or [[fail|sinforLYFE]].
*Advances to Super-Asshole-Ninja-Dick-Suckers.
*Able to throw shit (no srsly) but its a cash item so noone buys it.
'''Bandit'''
*Gets to stab innocent woodland creatures with ancient, mystical, [[weeaboo|ninja]] powers. 
*Advances to guy who gets to blow shit up and [[rape|STAB]] [[all caps|EVEN FASTER LOLOLOLOLOL]].
*Have incredible evasion at high levels, but still can't avoid the [[AIDS]].
*A.K.A Fagdit, or butt bandit.

===Mage===
[[drug|MAGIC]] USERS.
[[Image:cleric.jpg|right|thumb|Really a [[trap|man]].]]
'''[[meth|Ice]]/Lightening Mage'''
*Starts off strong in the second job, shitty in the third, and even shittier in the fourth. Oh well, at least you can still annoy the hell out of everyone else with Blizzard.
*Advances to having a huge fucking ice attack that fucks the entire map up. These are the [[assholes|people]] that come into your map and [[rape|kill everything in a single blow]].
'''Fire/Poison Mage'''
*10 year old pyromaniacs and gothic assholes.
*The shittiest of the three mage classes. Telling them this will cause them to simultaneously [[shit bricks]] and start a massive [[lulz]]fest of flames. It is also the most annoying mage class due to their ability to [[eproctophilia|spread a large green cloud of gas and block everyone's vision]] in 3rd job. What's worse is that this inevitably leads to [[13 year old boy]]s asking "WHO FARTED?1!"
*Advances to [[shit_nobody_cares_about|Fire/Poison Arch mage]].
'''Cleric'''
*One of the most useful [[whore|classes]] in the game. Every [[orgy|party]] needs a [[slut|healer]]. All clerics have to do is sit there and [[blow|heal]] all the other players. 90% of clerics are [[men|cute azn gurls]] that <b>are</b> <s>probably</s> [[truth|40 year old hairy men in real life.]]
*At their 3rd job advancement, they turn into [[rapist|Catholic Priests]] and use holy magicz from their [[satan|Maple God]]
*Has an ability that allows them to increase the experience gained in a party. This has caused many priests to stand in a safe spot (Nexon gave a big fuck you to these assholes by limiting the number of times you can spam a skill while hanging on a rope) and spam this move by holding down the button with a quarter or other weight. They can go [[afk]] like lazy fucks while the rest of the party actually plays [[the game]] in order to level.
*Advances to <s>[[whore|super magic priest]]</s> the Pope!!1!
*40 year old hairy men choose this profession to flirt with other guys in Maple, especially while pretending to be a [[16 year old girl|16 year old]] [[azn]] chick.

===Bowmen===
NO ONE IS A BOWMAN. EVER.
[[Image:bowman.jpg|right|thumb|Typical [[emo|bowman]] crying because [[Pools closed|he couldn't close the pool]].]]
'''Bowman'''
*Shittiest class in the game, excluding super-beginners, until level 120, not that they count anyways. [[Faggots|People]] say that they are the best class when high [[over_9000|level]] but by the time [[failure|you]] get there you've lost all your friends and your family hates you.
*Advances to [[shit|nothing]].
'''Crossbowman'''
*Slightly less shitty than bowman
*Nobody cares.
*Fags are often seen wishing they had picked a better job and begging for arrows. Poor maplefags.

===[[hooker|Pirates]]===
As if four classes wasn't enough, Maple Story has added pirates to the mix! Many [[americunts|Americans]] feared they would not get pirates, because a previously added map that had monsters with guns had been censored (seriously, they gave one of them a squeaky hammer for a weapon). Eventually Nexon leaked we would be getting pirates [[losers|causing a shitstorm of people to create pirate-only guilds and lvl 10 beginners that would be able to advance ASAP.]] Despite being assassins with guns, and bandits with fists, [[OVER 9000]] people have made pirates already. This has caused all items for pirates to skyrocket in price, and newb pirates to suck dick for a split bullet. Oh yeah, the gay argument of [[Ninjas vs. Pirates|pirates vs. thieves]] has taken over pretty much all of the discussions in Maple Story.

'''Gunslinger'''
*black person.
*Throws grenades.
*[[lol wut|Flys?]]
*Advances to [[criminal|Outlaw]], and afterward Corsair.
*Can summon [[tentacle rape|octopi]] to [[cum|spit ink]] and [[Chikins|birds]] to [[shit|drop bombs]].
*Is able to take control of monsters, presumably for [[rape]].
*Ultimate ability involves boarding a ship and [[Man The Harpoons|firing your cannons]].
*Some of the shittiest fucking damage until you get to Outlaw and Corsair.  But who has the fucking patience?

'''Brawler'''
*[[RAGE|Likes to punch things]].
*Kills mobs by spamming a [[Gay|twinkly backflip kick]]
*Likes to [[Street Fighter 2|uppercut shit]].
*Can [[pussy|hide]] [[Metal Gear Solid|in a barrel]].
*Elbows you in your face.
*Advances to [[murderer|Marauder]], and afterward Buccaneer.
*Punches things [[All Caps|EVEN HARDER]].
*Can [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|charge up energy]] for stronger attacks and transformations.
*Can attack using the power of a [[FYIAD|dragon]].
*Ultimate ability involves transforming into what appears to be [[Weeaboo|SSJ 3 GOKU!!1!!1!!]]
*Most moves are blatant rip-offs of [[Dragon Ball Z|Super Saiyan]] shit.

===Knights of Cygnus===

Also known as "[[cock|KoCs]]", Cygnus Knights were released in [[Shit nobody cares about|a recent patch]]. As usual, everyone jumped on the bandwagon until you couldn't blink without seeing them [[All Caps|FUCKING EVERYWHERE]].

The formula Nexon used to create the KoCs was a simple, yet idiotically effective one: take all the regular jobs, rename a few skills. Move a few skills from 3rd to 2nd job. Make them look more [[Weeaboo]] friendly. If nothing Nexon did before was a huge middle finger in your face, then truly you're getting [[blow job|KoC-slapped in the face]] with this job. Not only do they out-damage their regular counterparts, but depending on the level of your "[[Your mom|parent]] character" they can become even [[Over 9000|more powerful]]. However, this relationship is symbiotic; the [[Your resistance only makes my penis harder!|stronger your KoC is]], the more powerful the parent character becomes. Thus, everybody with a high level character absolutely scrambled to make one lest they be told that their damage sucks. You could get a:

*[[Kill it with fire|Blaze Wizard]]

*[[Christfag|Dawn Warrior]]

*[[Eproctophilia|Wind archer]]

*black person,

*or [[The Game|Thunder Breaker]].

Regardless of what you choose, these characters turn out to be a huge waste of time and money, as KoCs max out at level 120. This means that they're utterly [[shit|worthless]] at any of the end-game [[Final Boss of the Internet|bosses]]. The only benefit is that your main character is stronger and your [[e-peen]] is slightly larger.

===[[Metroid|Aran]]===

As known as "[http://nxcache.nexon.net/maplestory/aran/swf/maple_video.swf Aang]" to most Maplers.
Just released in [[Singapore|Maple S.E.A]] and <s>soon to be</s> now released on Global Maplestory, the [[Nazi|Aryan race]] (u c what i did thar?) is a [[Cock|polearm]] user, who gets a mob attack at level 13 and pwns all of the previous jobs. The job begins with a flashback. You play through the flashback as a [[Noob|level 200 Aran with 50 HP and 5 MP]]. Once you come back you will wake up with a weird girl in front of your face. She begins stalking you. You go through the tutorial and you are an Aran. Arans PWN every other job with their massive dmg at low levels but you'll end up with carpal tunnel tunnel syndrome before you reach level 30 if you play one of these since you have to tap the attack button instead of holding it. One of the five Legendary [[an hero|Hero]] classes.

===Evan===

The only class that gives you a [[dragon]] [[Fellatio| to do your bidding]]. It's probably the shittiest class yet.
Its attack speed is the slowest out of all the other magicians.
But, if you do sit and wait [[over 9,000]] minutes, you'll be presented with the worst damage out of all the other classes in the game as well. One of the five Legendary [[an hero|Hero]] classes.

===[[:File:DualBlade.jpg|DualBlade]]===

A LIMITED EDITION class being tested by the [[gooks]] on the Korean server. A complete copy of the bandit class with [[faggot|flashier]] looking animations. Made entirely so Nexon can get more money since all the 4th Job skillbooks need to be bought in the cash shop.

===[[Your resistance only makes my penis harder!|Resistance]] Classes===
The [[Your resistance only makes my penis harder!|Resistance]] are the [[master race|ultimate class]] consisting of three [[jews|jobs]] located in some town in [[Nazi]] [[Germany]]. You start off as a Jew but are quickly recruited by the [[Your resistance only makes my penis harder!|Resistance]] to help rid Germany of all the Nazis and prevent the [[Erection|resurrection]] of the [[Hitler|Black Magician]]. (Only available in Korea right now).


'''Battle Mage'''
This job uses black [[magick|magic]] and shit.

'''Wild Hunter'''
Furfag job. You [[Humping|ride]] a Jaguar the entire time while firing off [[cum|arrows]] at your enemies.

'''[[Gurren Lagann|Mechanic]]'''
Extremely overpowered job that rides a MOTHER FUCKING MECH. [[ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH|This job is all about doing the impossible and touching the untouchable. One of the first skills you get goddamn drill attack.]] Fuck. The best of the resistance classes because their instructor is Pedobear.

==Nexon==

MapleStory happens to be run by some of the most Jew groups of [[Azns]] in the world. They'll say they're interested to know [[Anal|what users want]], but rly, they're more concerned with gold-plating their cocksheaths and raping the shit out of your mommy's bank account. They'll release things for [[over 9000|over $9000]] one day, and then have it be free the next week. Because of this, people feel the need to [[emo|whine, bitch, and moan]] about [[butthurt|every little thing they find wrong with the recent version, even if there's nothing to bitch about]].

Not to mention they ignore problem causers, such as hackers, while going for easy targets like anyone who has been reported through the in-game system for "harassment." One such example is the [http://sleepywood.net/forum/showthread.php?t=1625496 mass security breach] of late 2009 on into 2010, which is being completely ignored while Nexon [http://maplestory.nexon.net/WZ.ASPX?PART=/News/View&boardNo=100&contentNo=0066B brags about banning] 2974 [[script kiddies]].

In addition, Nexon decided to divide the Global server up into about 17 different servers around the world and blocked access to the Global server from a shitload of foreign IPs.  As a result, those who played Global not only lost their characters, they could no longer play with their butt-buddies in America.  Clever. This group of foreign rejects reluctantly switched over to European MapleStory, or EMS, which is available for [[Eurofags]] in a variety of [[moonspeak|languages]].

This leads to one of two possibilities:  Either Nexon is a collection of lazy fuckwits, or they are the greatest accidental trolls ever conceived.  After all, it takes something special to do what they have done.

[[Bullshit|Nexon also claims that if you use any hacks you owe them $1000 in damages as stated in their Terms of Service agreement you agreeded with as soon as you made an account. $100,000 if you make a private server of their shitty game.]]

UPDATE: Nexon made [[over 9000|$517 million]] in 2009!

===Acts of Desperation (faggotry)===

Every once in a while, Nexon will decide that it's droves of [[weeaboo]] fags aren't enough, and will start trying to get back the original [[asspie]] basement dweller back in the game by offering them free stuff. despite the fact that some of the people who get these "COME BACK TO MAPLESTORY PLEASE FAG??" E-mails sell the codes, Nexon, using flashy and mutlicolored Korean [[rice nigger]] special effects manages to rope back in another [[99.9%]] of them.

===NX Cash===

[[Image:Cashshop.jpg|right|thumb|Waste your money here!]]

NX Cash, or [[shit nobody cares about|Nexon Cash]], is what you get when you spend IRL money [[Dumbass|on a free game]]. All [[Fucktard|spoiled]], MapleStory-addicted children who are lucky enough to get ahold of their mommy's or daddy's credit cards/PayPal information, will blow [[at least 100|hundreds]] of dollars per month on NX. This is used to buy worthless [[shit]] in MapleStory's Cash Shop system. The only purpose of these items is to make their character look [[Homosexual|super spechul]], and disappear after 90 days so as to get you to spend more. One thousand NX is one U.S. [[Lioncash|dollar]], meaning you are wasting five dollars just to change the color of your eyes, which are actually made up of 3 pixels.
 
Such items include:
*[[furry|Pets]] that follow you around and annoy other users by letting out horrid emulations of animal noises when they are praised or [[beastiality|punished]].
*Super [[kawaii]] clothing[[Oneoneone|!11]]
*Megaphones or Super Megaphones (called Smegas by [[Azn|most players]]) in which users can shout to the [[Azn|entire server]] that they [[fail]] at life, and/or [[Owned|"Found a new Web Site that lets you get free mesarz by merely entering your user ID, Password, and game pin!"]].
*More worthless [[shit]].
*Wedding rings, for those who are impossibly lonely and need a steady partner for [[cybersex|cybering]].
*Expressions on how you feel [[IRL]] such as getting [[butthurt]] or [[rape|how you "accidentally" shoved large objects up your ass]].
*Shitty hairstyles. WTF IS WITH THE BALD PATCH?
*Gachapon tickets. Whenever you go to a machine, you will get a shit load of crappy items. People who try and get leet items usually phail, unless they spend [[OVER 9000]] dollars.
*Guy Fawkes Mask. In anticipation for another [[Project Chanology]] raid, Nexon tried to find a way to make money off of it. LOLFAILED.
*Throwing shit! (no srsly its for assassins)
[[Image:Pedobearmaplestory.jpg|right|thumb|Pedobear, doing his duty.]]
*'''A PEDOBEAR HAT?!'''
It's true. MapleStory features a Pedobear hat, and for only $2.60. If you are going to [[waste|spend]] money on this game, [[lies|this is possibly the only worthy item to buy]]. Not only is it endlessly entertaining to also purchase a net and chase little girls around, but, if you don't have a mask but see someone who does, it's also fairly lulzy to follow them and put your character into [[rape|'compromising' positions]] with said bear. The user who you're harassing probably doesn't know what Pedobear is, but they get annoyed quickly when you mention it and ask them if they'd be interested in attending your little brother's/sister's 3rd birthday party tomorrow and that you already know that they're 'nice and tight'.
This is also fair evidence that Nexon is run by pedophiles. All they need now is [[Shotacat]], [[amirite]]?

== NX Whores ==

[[Image:Kiaylowhore01.jpg|right|thumb|Typical NX whore begging for [[buttsecks|NX]]]]
[[Image:Kiaylowhore03.jpg|left|thumb|[[Asking for it|Typical whore asking for it]]]]
Like [[Gaia online|Gaia Online]] - there are many [[weeaboo|weeaboos]] that buy [[drugs|crack and teh meth]] that can't afford their own Neckson Kash!  OH NOEZ!!!  WHAT WILL I DO 4 SUM NX???  [[Loser|When even attempts at stealing mommy and daddy's credit card fails ...]] they turn to [[whore|whoring]] themselves out for [[rape|NX]].  Don't even think about getting a [[tits or gtfo|titty shot]], since [[Rules of the Internet|Rule 32 of the Internets]] is [[Fact|factual]] in stating that there are no girls online so any female wanting NX is actually a [[pedophile|13 yr old boy wanting some surprise buttsecks]]!

==Common phrases in MapleStory==

*'''CC PLZ''' - Please [[Gtfo|go to another channel]] because I want to [[rape|kill]] those monsters. Usually used by [[Wapanese]] [[assholes]], running on a fresh cup of [[Unwarranted self-importance|tiger jizz]]. This  excuse is frequently used so they can [[Yiff|party with other users to gain moar xp. ]]
*'''S>+1INT HMT60%/+3STR BW10%/SPCLW+2/5mil/fuku n1gg3rs/@@@@@@''' - Pardon me sir, would you be interested in some of this worthless bullshit inventory that I need to get rid of?  This phrase can be recognized as "S>" followed by any form of indecipherable [[AOL speak]].
*'''1K PLZ''' - Can you spare me [[at least 100|a thousand]] of your mesos please?
*'''OMG U [[Hacker|HAXX0R]][[oneoneone|!!!!1]]''' - Someone talking about a hacker?
[[Image:Maplestorywarrior.JPG|right|thumb|DONT KS B!TCH]]
*'''FAME PLZ''' - Can you add a point of [[Fag|fame]] to my character please?
*'''DONT KS B!TCH''' - Please don't killsteal. (The ! takes the place of the I in [[bitch]] because of Maple Story's shitty censors)
*'''Looking for GF/BF with NX whisp/chat me!!!''' Usually spammed by basement dwellers on a [[goatse|super megaphone]] because they lack the ability to find a partner of the opposite sex [[irl]].
*'''JPQ!!!!@@@@#@#####''' - I am gathering members of comparable standing to engage in a MapleStory [[clusterfuck|party quest]].
*'''SPAM T1GERC0CK469 LV125 LEGIT 6JOB GRATZ$OMGLUL''' - Please assrape my lifeless stalker-friend for playing this terrible game [[at_least_100|107]] hours straight.
*''' KSSSSS WOAAAAAR !)0!!!1101!'''- Used by delusional retards like [[Curly]]. Must be screamed while stuffing potato chips into one's fat pothole.

*'''IM SO PRO''' - [[you|Used for lifeless basement dwellers who think they're better than everybody.]]
*'''@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@''' - People use this because of nexon's "NO SPAMM LOLOLOL" system so they can spam for party quests and shit.Example:                                                                    
*'''J>PQ LVL 10 MAGE@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@!!!!''' (Another 2 times)                                                                                
*'''J>PQ LVL 10 MAGE@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@!!!''' (ANOTHER 2 TIMES)
*'''J>PQ LVL 10 MAGE@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@!! '''  (ANOOTHER 2 TIMES)
*'''FUK U GAIZ AM PROA SO AM LIVIN'!''' (Congratulations, [[you|you]] win)
*'''Vac hacking''' - [[lies|Archaic term that is no longer in use due to some action taken by the fucking GMs ... for once.]]
*'''Fucking KSing Sin''' - Generalization that all Assassins kill-steal ... because they fucking '''do'''.
*'''lul ur dmg is low nub''' - Some fucker with no life has just fucking called you out for having a life.  Well, sort of having a life, since you still play the fucking game.
*'''STOP LOOTING OUR DROPS''' - Usually used during PQs in which an important item (read: imaginary piece of shit) is stolen by a [[noob]].

==Language Filter==

No shitty game would be complete without its own curse filter. Sure, [[1337|replacing one or two letters with numbers]] might be a minor annoyance, but cursing on the interwebs is serious fucking business, and the [[korea|GM's]] on [[goatse|MapleStory]] realized that. Thanks to their filter, they can now rob you of your right to free speech, and while you're trying to figure out why the filter [[owned|cock blocked]] you, you get [[rape|raepd]] by some [[mudkip|shit monster]]. Don't blame the GM's though, Koreans aren't used to the concept of free speech. A list of some of the most [[lulz|offensive]] words and phrases have been blocked from the game:
[[Image:Racist maple.JPG|right|thumb|[[Niggers]] are a popular target for ridicule in Maple Story.]]
[[Image:Racist maple2.JPG|right|thumb|Even moar evidence of [[racism]].]]
[[Image:Maple0103.jpg|right|thumb]]
*[[Fag|Gay]]
*[[Bitch]]
*[[cum|Circumstance]]
*[[testicles|Ball]]
*[[Spics|Spice]]
*[[Fellatio|Blow]] ([[irony|Ironic]], because half of the skillz include the word)
*[[rape|Grape]]
*[[sperm|Whisper me]]
*[[weeaboo|Japan]]
*[[Hitler]] (What was WW2, anyway?)
*[[Cock|C8]]
*[[Pedobear]]
*black person
*Fish Tank
*Pigs
*Any given word at any given time

Oddly enough, the system doesn't censor a large number of [[emoticons]], so you can spam wreathed phalluses at your leisure.


The best way to win back your right to free speech is to use Notepad, but this only results in banhammer, and much [[lulz|lulz]] amongst the millions of [[Azn|chinks]] and [[weeaboo|weeaboos]] when they announce [[butthurt|NOTICE: b4s3mNtDWLR has been banned for cursing]].

== How to Troll Maple Story ==

'''First of all, if you seriously need help trolling in this game, go die in a fire.  It should go without saying that this is one of the easiest games to troll on the Internet.  That said:'''

[[Image:Delicious maple cake.jpg|right|thumb|/b/tards in Maple Story, attempting to get their hands on delicious [[cake|caek]]. Notice the presence of [[Cockmongler]].]]
[[Image:123517534523.jpgâ|right|thumb|Now with [[Ron Paul]] .]]
*[[hacker|Hack]] and KS [[n00bs]] in the beginner areas with a high level character.
*Repeatedly tell them that they have [[AIDS]].
*Disconnect a famous player with a D/C hack program.
*Claim a popular area and spam "CC PLZ" to everyone.
*Whisper to the people in wedding announcements and tell them that their future e-spouse is ugly, and or, has cheated on them with another e-lover. (Give them the name of a random person you have passed by for added lulz)
*Play a drop game (A game in which you and other players drop rare items to show off to each other) and use a "vac hack" (A hack in which all items on screen will come to you for [[gay|grabbing]] instantly)  to grab the items. You then proceed to log off, keeping the hard earned items forever. This leaves the other players [[emo|cutting]] themselves in sadness and anger.
*Often players will drop rare items by themselves so they can show off and be [[faggots]]. While they are doing this, snatch their crap, and when they ask,"GIVE BACK!", tell them they are stupid faggots and deserve to get their items snatched.
*Go into the wedding area, Amoria, and spam "LOOKING FOR PQ@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@" repeatedly.
*Go into the [[Lies|Free]] Market, and spam "B> Fame 20k fame then trade me@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@". Then, go into Menu > Game Options and turn off trade requests. Continue spamming. Butthurt noobs will stand on you and claim that you scam. When that happens, change channels and continue spamming.
*Spam trade/party invites as much as possible.
*Make fun of asians, this will result in the [[300|thousand nations of the asian empire descending upon you]], [[Srsly]].
*Spam on megaphones (or anywhere near a crowd of people, word spreads quickly amongst the [[nazi|maplers]]) how much you dislike anime, preferably Naruto or any anime on adult swim.
*Call someone a [[n00b]] despite the fact you might be 20-30 levels lower than that person. Also, calling someone with a srsly high level a [[hacker]] generally leads to their [[orgy|guild]] threatening to kill you irl. [http://sleepywood.net Bonus points for doing it on a shitty fan-forum].
*Repeatedly ask "MESAR PL0X?!?!" to anyone that walks by, and don't stop until that person [[An hero|logs off]].
*B>(buy) all the shit you can see and destroy it all, inflating the e-conomy. 
*Go to a MapleStory forum and make a new thread entitled "______ should be NX-only!", with the blank being something like "New Maps", "Level 70 Weapons", or "Zakum Helms".  It works every time.
*Also, class discussion threads work very well for trolling as well. Any thread on a MapleStory forum comparing two classes to each other will instantly yield a 10 page long thread in less than a hour.
*Convince your [[faggots|guild-mates]] to stalk and ks a high level player.
*Always [[DO_IT_FAGGOT|threaten]] ks-war on every map--even if you're just walking through.
*Always [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|defame]] every high level character you see. [[Pussy|Be sure to immediately log off to prevent retaliatory defames.]]
*Have players apologize for you killing their [[mudkipz|monster]].
*Players get extremely [[Butthurt|derailed]] if you [[Attention_whore|megaphone]] something bad about them, which usually makes them spend more of [[Jew_gold|<s>their own</s> their parent's money]] to refute the message.
*Join an Eos Tower party quest, secretly loot some of the passes and blend in like a dumbfuck while watching the leader yell at everybody for them.
*Join a long party quest and at the final stage claim you're holding everybody "hostage" and threaten to leave the party if they don't fork over 50k. (Leaving will cause everybody to be kicked resulting in a bunch of [[rage|rage]] fagz and lulz).
*If a [[faggot|player]] tells you to '[[Gtfo|cc plz]],' continue to [[Stalk|follow]]/[[Circle_jerk|ks]] until they give you [[Jenkem|mesos]].
*Take off all your gear and [[Whore|beg]] for mesos/[[Sandwich|gear]]/[[Lmaonade|potions]]--proceed to play like this until someone [[Gullible|generous]] comes along.
*Make up sentences which includes Nexon, Wizet, GM's etc. For example, azn chinks eats dogs! Niggers stinks of shit, you cant tell the difference!
*[[????]]
*[[PROFIT!]]

===[[Teabagging|Use Your Sack]]===

One of the gloriously [[fail|undocumented]] features in this game is the random appearance of items with names like '''black person''', '''[[Aspergers|Different Sack]]''', and '''[[Tentacle rape|Monster Sack]]'''.  As it turns out, their only purpose is to spontaneously spawn a certain type and number of deadly creatures wherever the sack master is standing.  You can dress up your character to look like the other [[n00bs]], stand in a crowd of 20 people, and unleash monsters on them while they are AFK or trying to heal. Either that, or use it on one AFK pro, and when he comes back, get your popcorn ready for the butthurt.

==A regular mapler==

<youtube>nKydGUYWf6U</youtube>

A eurofag taking it too far, posting a IRL vid. This shows how gay maplers actually are.

<youtube>bj3k94WeZxU</youtube>

==What Maplers boner to==

A lot of *cough* research shows that maplers are immature freaks that boner over pixels and lost audio(look at the comments).

PROOF:
<youtube>ygabIWXDceg</youtube>

And they somehow find this funny.

<youtube>LtOFR_V__Mg</youtube>

==MapleStory 2: [[Electric Boogaloo]]?==
Yes, some companies out there actually think ripping off MapleStory is actually a profitable move for their business. All of the players of these games will consistently tell you that their game is [[bullshit|nothing like MS]] so[[trolling| don't go comparing it to Maple on their forums]].
<i>For full coverage, see the list of [[MapleStory Clones]] here.</i>

==Private Servers==
[[Image:Wz_edits.png|thumb|right| Typical .wz hacked private server.]]

Most people are too [[Numa Numa|lazy]] to grind on [[Hentai|Slimes]] for 40 hours, so script kiddies go [[Bullshit|out of their way]] to make a special server. These servers usually contain:

*Overly high rates. Kill a [[Drugs|Silver slime]] for instant level 200.
*GMship. Kill every [[Fag]] for no reason at all.
*UFJ. [[YOU'RE A BIRD!|Fly]] around a map because apparently, to Private Server players, that's fun.
*Stable server. Disconnect every 5 minutes.
*Custom .wz files. So the perverted server owners can [[shoop]] tits and [[Dicks Everywhere|dicks onto everything]]. Then make you redownload the entire game before you can [[fap|play]].
*[[AIDS|Lag]].

==Nexon Still Doesn't have enough moneys==
[[Image:nexoneedsmoneys.jpg|right|thumb|Artist's rendition of the case of Jew vs. The [[An hero|Guy]] Who Made OdinMS.]]
No need to get mad about your money Nexon, as soon as Maplefags realize they are out of money, you [[Retard|Jews]] will phail at these shitty companies. Maybe the worst game ever. [[419 Nigerian Email Scams|Idiots never seem to run out of money.]]

Since 90% of Maplefags realized Nexon were just raping them in the ass for their parents moneys most switched to private servers. Nexon decided they didn't have enough [[jew gold|moneys]] from [[assholes|weeaboos]] who buy the [[shit|ugliest fake clothes on the face of the planet]] every single fucking day so Nexon sued this guy who was just really bored one day.

http://www.odinms.de

He now owes Nexon 2.1bil mesos for making a free and less crappy version of MapleStory.[http://maple-news.com/2008/06/19/follow-up-on-odinms-lawsuit/] Sucks for him.

'''HOLY SHIT, NEWS:''' Jew gets arrested for [[Computer Science III|hacking]] the server [[Porn|files]]. [[Partyvan|They took immediate action.]]

==How Nexon Deals with Private Servers==
===Lloyd [[Korn|KoÐ¯n]]===
[[Image:LordKorn.png|thumb|[[Truth|Actual]] photograph Mr. Lloyd Korn himself.]]
Lloyd Korn (also known as Lord Korn) is Nexon's [[lawyer|legal advisor]] for the company. On a regular day at work he goes straight to his office, locks the door and faps to [[hentai|maple-hentai]]. One day one of Nexon's higher ups caught him in the act and threatened to [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|fire]] his ass if he didn't get to work. He was then assigned to take care of [[The Game|the game's]] private server problem. After [[Cease and Desist|taking out]] all the big time servers Neåon still wouldn't pay the [[faggot]] so now he patrols maplefag forums and sues [[13-year-old boys]] who make servers to [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|pretend they're important]]. He's responsible for shutting down [[at least 100]] MapleStory private servers since [[last thursday]]

===Jamie J. Fitzgerald===
Lloyd Korn's [[waifu]]. Another one of Nexon's legal pigs.  [[Dox]] can be found [http://forum.ragezone.com/f425/jamie-j-fitzgerald-doxd-610145/ here.]
