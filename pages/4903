LiveJournal Roleplay
[[Image:Nyokosecret.png|thumb|Every LJ RPer will experience a similar situation at some point.|right]]

'''LiveJournal Roleplay''' is the term used to describe when two or more [[furries|people]] pretend to be [[animu]] characters (or, in [[entertainment roleplay]], [[celebrities]]) in elaborate settings. These [[shit nobody cares about|scenes]] can be played out in a variety of places, such as [[AIM]], [[IRC]], [[Gaia]], [[Neopets]], and online message boards, as well as [[IRL]]. One of the more popular venues for this activity is [[LiveJournal]], which has [[over 9,000]] roleplaying communities.

==Basics of LJ roleplaying==
To roleplay properly, one must be an [[elitist]], having [[no life|thoroughly dissected]] the personality and actions of the character, or "[[batshit crazy|muse]]" they have decided to play. They will spend hours writing up entries detailing [[shit nobody cares about|their muse's life]] and spend an [[basement dweller|equally long time]] working on comments to other characters in the roleplay. Everything they type must be the pinnacle of [[fail|perfection]], lest they be mercilessly ripped to shreds by fellow [[losers|roleplayers]].

LJ roleplayers are notoriously [[douchebag|passive-aggressive]] and will use any means necessary to attack lesser roleplayers while [[chickenshit|never having to confront them directly]]. The most commonly used shield is that of [[Anonymous]]. Entire communities have been created for the sole purpose of anonymously tearing other players down.

This, naturally, leads to epic [[wank]] and [[lulz]].

===Common LJ RP terms===
Terms you will almost definitely run into in the LJ RP world. Feel free to add more. Thanks to the ever helpful anons at the [http://rp-anon-meme.livejournal.com/2322.html?thread=4381714#t4381714 rp_anon_meme], here's some [[moar]]:

*IC - [[batshit crazy|In Character]].

*OOC - Out of Character. This term can be used both to denote speaking to [[virgin|other players]] as [[you|yourself]] instead of as your muse, or [[shit nobody cares about|having your muse behave in a way they never would in canon]].

*Muse - What [[psycho|some people]] call their characters.  Some also use this to mean the thing which gives them their inspiration, which is typically the character that [[batshit insane|lives in their head]].

*Pup - Another term for characters. Short for "puppet".

*Kid - Yet another term for characters! Apparently, muses are goats.

*[[mundane|Mun]] - What [[basement dweller|players]] call themselves, which most likely is derived from the word mundane in that all humans are boring and only fictional characters are [[Shit|awesome]]!11!1 This may or may not be some [[weeaboo]] shit.

*Log - A roleplay interaction written in prose.

*Mod - Short for [[moderator]]. These players should be kissed up to as much as possible to earn favoritism privileges.

*PB - Stands for Played By (or Picture Bitch). Used when players use a [[unrealistic expectations|celebrity]]'s picture to represent their character in icons.

*CR - Stands for Character Relationships. Used to describe what characters your character talks to. 

*[[BNF]] - Big Name Fan. Kiss these people's asses and become their [[goon|lackey]]s to feel important. They are the gods of the RP world, along with mods.

*Circlejerk - Another name for a [[clique]] of players who spend all their time [[hugbox|complimenting each other]] and ignoring everyone else.

*Shooped Vendetta - Getting caught with delete or edit buttons on your self-praise secret and claiming that someone photoshopped them in there to make you look bad. 

*orz (also ORZ, OTL and/or otl) - A little man bowing. Definitely some [[weeaboo]] shit.

*SCRE - God I don't even care, that's fucking retarded.

==Bad Roleplayers Suck==

{{quote|Dear mod:

I [[hate]] you. No, seriously, I do. And, coming from me, that says something. [[almost raped|You give me this sick, panicky feeling in my chest simply by talking to me OOC]]. [[psycho|You stress me out in ways I can't even begin to explain]]. You're insanely [[elitist|high and mighty]], like your (insert deity name here)'s gift to the roleplaying world. And you know something? You're not. Congrats, you can write, but you still can't create a decent character to save your life. And you're a bloody [[attention whore]]. Nothing can be about anyone else. If someone starts talking about something in their life, you just pop into the conversation with some asinine comment like "[[annoying|*flails wildly*]]" or "[[douchebag|*makes noises for attention*]]" [[an hero|You make me want to cut myself]].|typical BRPS post}}

{{ljcomm|bad_rpers_suck}}, also known as BRPS, was created in 2002 for roleplayers to [[whine|vent]] about other roleplayers they consider unworthy of their presence. Since its creation, it has caused much wank and lulz. [[Sock puppet]]s are commonly used here so that people can bitch about their [[E-nemy|bff]]s and not get into trouble with them over complaining about how much they [[fail]].

More often than not, people find out that they're being bitched about on said community, and come and [[cry moar]] to all of the BRPS regulars, from whom they expect sympathy. They never get any.

==RP Secrets==

[[Image:Rpsecret.jpg|thumb|Typical [[emo]] [[bullshit]] secret from roleplaysecrets.|right]]

rp_secrets was created in mid-2008 as a companion to {{ljcomm|fandom_secrets}}, both of which are rip-offs of Postsecret. The point was to create [[moar]] wank among the LJ RP community. While there is the occasional ass-patting secret, the majority are personal attacks, though [[noone]] is sure what the criteria is for a personal attack getting censored - leading to lots of [[cry moar]] responses from the community at large

Nearly two months after its creation, however, one of the mods, in a fit of [[butthurt]], deleted the community. She restored it a few hours later, citing [[hackers]], but everyone knew it was her and when they accused her, she deleted the community again, [[Deleting your LiveJournal|forever this time]].

LJ RPers, [[drama whore|dramawhores]] that they are, quickly created an assload of copycat communities. The one that most people fled to was {{ljcomm|roleplaysecrets}}, as it was created and maintained by two of the same mods from the original rp_secrets, minus the butthurt mod, but including {{ljuser|queen_qing}}, responsible for the introduction of shooped vendettas to roleplaysecrets thanks to posting a secret praising her own Kanda and getting subsequently butthurt about being caught at it, and her friends/defenders from {{ljcomm|polychromatic}}.

==rp_anon_meme==

[[Image:Make beowulf.png|thumb|Anonymous went too far...or did they?]]

 [[Image:Hoisttheflag.PNG|thumb|{{lj|fuckrecaptcha}}: Revive the spirit of RP!]]

The {{lj|rp_anon_meme}} was started in August of 2008 as a free-for-all Anonymous bloodfest. The [[meme]] was created for the sole purpose bitching about other roleplayers, and seemingly worked, sending a lot of [[butthurt]] roleplayers packing. It amassed just over 11,000 comments, though its reign of terror was cut short by Anonymous spamming it with [[Beowulf]]. And let's not forget the cameo by [[Seaking]], in which Beowulf began [[gay|buttfucking]] said fish. (Yeah, you heard me.) Unfortunately, most of that was [[bahleeted]] by the creator of {{lj|rp_anon_meme}}, who apparently had a limited sense of humor. 

===Part 2: Fail All Around===
It was revived in October of 2008, but there has yet to be as much drama in the sequel (typical, [[amirite]]?). This is [[fail]] on the part of the meme's creator for barely giving the community a month to amass new [[butthurt]] and [[drama]]. Most threads were just rehashes of threads from the last meme, and most anons were professing boredom. As of October 8, however, the {{lj|rp_anon_meme}} has withdrawn...for now (insert ominous music here).

===Fail spinoffs===
Another anon hate meme was created shortly after {{lj|rp_anon_meme}}'s death, at {{lj|rpanonmeme}}, but it suffered a [[shit no one cares about|premature]] death before reaching 150 comments. Not much of a hate meme.

During the October revival, an anon was intrigued by the notion of making the same comments while shedding anon and logging in and created {{lj|fuckrecaptcha}} (in reference to reCaptcha, LJ's test to prove that you are not a robot when making anonymous comments. Anons, the whiny little bitches they are, complained about its existence with comments on {{lj|rp_anon_meme}}, often and loudly). However, because LJ RPers are [[pussies]], this meme [[fail|fell flat on its face]] with a grand total of [[shit nobody cares about|82 comments]].

As shown in the [http://rp-anon-meme.livejournal.com/2807.html RP Anon Meme post] dated October 8, two more anon memes have sprung forth - this time, {{lj|rp_talk}}, which promises to be a rather boring waste of time ("No [[wank]] or bashing or anything like that"? Aw, dammit), and [http://www.rpgchan.com/ RPG Chan], which likely will [[fail]] because, as we all know, LJ roleplayers rarely leave the womb of [[LiveJournal]].

And of course, every time a big wankfest shows up in LJ RP land, a [[hugbox|love meme]] must be created to counter it. Asspats for everyone!

===Part 3: Why do people still care?===
For a while, {{lj|rp_anon_meme}} provided a monthly place for people to spew bile all over, but eventually the creator herself get bored of it, and it was up to the masses to find a new pit of voles. {{lj|rp_anon_redux}} lept forward to fill this hole, but didn't enable anonymous commenting, defeating its own purpose. The creator seemed to think this was hilarious, but after getting repeatedly called on how retarded this was, the creator wanked all over the meme and everyone left.

{{lj|rp_anonmeme}} soon filled the gap, and seems to be the victor of the RP Anon Meme War. Their victory is bitter sweet and tastes faintly of hangover vomit.

===[[Fail|RP Anon Meme Memes]]===
