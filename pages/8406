'''Tibet''' is a disputed region of Central Asia occupied by the [[People's Republic of China]]. Tibet was formerly a sovereign nation, but the [[Maoist]]s decided that China wasn't big enough and invaded. Today, Tibet is a country that freedom-lovers support yet refuse to [[Military|actually help]]. Despite [[Buddhists|burning monks]] and riots, China claims that it did more good than harm and "advanced" Tibetan people.

==History==
Despite what [[faggots|free tibet supporters]] think, Tibet is not some magical Shangri-la kingdom, but actually a mountainous shithole where 95% of the population lived as [[slavery|slaves]] and peasants, who toiled on the mountain to feed the monks, priests and lamas. Before liberation, the peasants lived happily as property of the monks, who happily donated their body parts to the monks, such as giving their thighbones to make musical instruments, and their skulls to make cups for the monks. In past centuries, Tibet had political dealings and intrigues with China and Mongolian tribes such as the Khoshut and Dzungar. They were also involved in warfare and civil war, such as the [[Shit nobody cares about|conflict between Red Hat and Yellow Hat Buddhists]]. Clearly, Tibet was a real place, not a mystical new-age hippie kingdom.

The myth of Shangri la really only existed as a myth for hipster faggots and losers suffering from [[Unwarranted Self-Importance]] who think that waving retarded flags and shouting retarded slogans is the next best thing since [[Interior Semiotics|pissing in a pot and smearing it on yourself]]. More likely, they would rather that corner of the world and the people in that country live in the stone age, just so they have something to fap to. The destruction of the myth would result in many retarded hippies noticing how empty their lives are, and would cause them to all [[An hero]].

In 1950, Mao got sick of the lama's shit and the PLA came and rocked the monks world. The Tibetan military's sticks, [[Dildos|swords]], rocks, and US provided weaponry were ineffective against the Chinese [[Pwned|tanks and machineguns]]. The [[UN]] didn't do anything, since they didn't remember Tibet ever being a real country and had forgotten about the whole self-determination concept in favour of abolishing slavery.

==Dalai Lama==

The '''Dalai Lama''' is the [[Pope|spiritual leader]] of Tibet. Pope as in spiritual leader, not a mouth piece for a pedophile organisation. [[lolwut|Each Dalai Lama is supposed to be the reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lama]]. After failing to expel the Chinese from Tibet, the Dalai Lama fled the country and was forced to continue ruling in exile. Now China seems to have forgotten about him, considering how the government haven't sent any hit squads to kill him yet, fucking amateurs.

==Immigration==
Large quantities of Chinese and Indians surround Tibet, and the former has the habit of flooding Tibet with [[Mexicans|unwanted immigrants]] and [[Dead baby dumping|baby-eating habits]]. At the same time, smart, wealthy, freedom-loving Tibetans emigrated from their homelands in order to better their lives, leaving their beloved slaves behind. It is believed that without the [[Great Wall of Mexico|building of a barrier]], Tibet will become 100% Chinese, and the Free Tibet movement would be for nothing. Disregard that the new railway thats just been recently built means what at least 100% of the population of Tibet is now Chinese.

==Human rights==
As with the rest of China, [[human rights]] are in short supply in Tibet. In the eyes of the Chinese, human rights is a foreign idea created by Westerners in order to make Communism even more difficult to implement. The Chinese believe that the biggest threat to establishing a firm Maoist grip on Tibet is traditional Tibetan culture and religion. As a result, the Maoists forced most of the monks inside of the country out and attempting to erode Tibetan culture through propaganda and torture. Tibetans oveseas, however, work hard to preserve Tibetan culture by adopting rap, speaking english and not learning Tibetan, and putting flags on their children.

*Ask them how the olympic boycott went.
*Tell them no one cares(they don't lol)
*Tell them that since Tibet was conquered in the Yuan dynasty, and later the Qing dynasty, it counts as Chinese territory.
*Ask them why doesn't the Dalai Lama allow people to worship Dorje Shugden.
*Drive a column of tanks up to them, and don't stop.
