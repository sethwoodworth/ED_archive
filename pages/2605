==[[A challenger appears]]==

It is very common in riddle threads that a [[fag|fag or multiple fags]] will try to posts riddles that they found on [[Google]]. The riddlefags are quick to point out these black person. 

Last Thursday riddlerfag posted a very tough riddle; a riddle no one on /b/ could solve (and with all the [[The_Cancer_That_Is_Killing_/b/|laff U lose, CP, Cut vs Uncut, and America vs Europe]] threads who has the time to think?) Anon dicked around too long and countless trolls invaded, which caused riddlecock to get all [[Butthurt|butthurt]] and decided he would quit [[The Game|the game]]. This of course is [[shit nobody cares about]].
