Banbot
[[Image:Banbot.png|thumb|The banbot in action]][[Image:Grenadeb0t.jpg|thumb|[[Last Thursday]], [[Yiri]] ported the banbot to RL.]]

The banbot is a bot authored by [[aempirei]]. It joins every public channel on a given [[IRC]] network and proceeds to announce the existence of [[Bantown]]. It then /invites every user it encounters to #bantown and adds their nick to its queue.

When a nick in the queue joins bantown, it bans them.

The banbot sometimes leads to interesting dialogue with the administrators of the largest IRC networks in the world:

==Banbot vs [[Freenode]]==
   18:37 <@BearPerson> freenode is a network about open-source software and other projects of peers helping peers
   18:37 -%- mode/#bant0wn [-bb *!?=oclet@hackforjes.us *!*@*] by oclet
   18:37 <@oclet> i heard it was for warez
   18:37 <@oclet> and pron
   18:37 <@BearPerson> you're quite welcome to hang out in the support channels and get or provide support
   18:38 <@BearPerson> but we're a bit harsh about warez and spam
   18:38 <@oclet> yeah me too
   18:38 <@oclet> i hate when people dont pay for software
   18:38 <@BearPerson> check out http://irc.netsplit.de/networks/
   18:38 <@oclet> it makes me want to slice my dong with a razor blade
   18:38 <@BearPerson> that's probably the most complete list of IRC networks out there
   18:39 <@BearPerson> I'm sure you'll find a network that is less harsh about this sort of stuff
   18:39 <@oclet> sweet. wanna harass quakenet with me?
   18:39 <@oclet> it will be teh l0lz
   18:40 <@BearPerson> at least, it will be more appropriate ;-)
   18:40 <@BearPerson> you see, quakenet is more IRC and "chaos" oriented than freenode, though not as much as EFnet
   18:41 <@BearPerson> freenode is neutral territory. We're here to provide a place for friendly support, which you can use or provide if you want
   18:42 <@BearPerson> but we can't be that place if we're constantly running after spammers and cleaning up channel wars
   18:42 <@oclet> i'm just here for the pr0n and the warez
   18:42 <@oclet> i dont know anything about spam
   18:42 <@BearPerson> then you're on the wrong network
   18:42 <@oclet> are you a [[furry]]?
   18:45 <@BearPerson> just keep this off freenode please, okay?
   18:45 <@oclet> sure
   18:45 <@oclet> tell me when you take the ban off of tor
   18:45 <@oclet> so i can do it again
