'''Nomadlisa''', also known as Lisa Murphy [[IRL|in real life]], owns the now-deleted LiveJournal account [http://nomadlisa.livejournal.com/ nomadlisa]. She also has another account over at [http://board.crewcial.org BCO] under the name [http://board.crewcial.org/view_profile.php?id=903 lisabash]. Her new LiveJournal account is [http://chunkems.livejournal.com chunkems].


She first became known within the [[Dramacrat]] community for her involvement in the [[Mediacrat]] saga -- she was [[andrewpants]]' roommate at the time and actively participated in the [[internet trial]] between [[Andrewpants]] and [[Mediacrat]] as Andrew's advocate and trusty friend. 


Nomadlisa's rise to [[internet celebrity]] status occured after a vehicle accident on Highway 101 north of Lockwood, CA on November 16, 2004 [http://www.livejournal.com/~andrewpants/71381.html], wherein Nomadlisa was the operator of the vehicle and was allegedly responsible for the death of her passenger and best friend, [http://divadolly.livejournal.com/ Sunny Perkins]. Shortly after the news of this accident reached [[Lulz News Network]], [[troll]] accounts began to sprout up on LiveJournal (example: [http://livejournal.com/~lisa_vs_sunny lisa_vs_sunny]) along with various Photoshop renditions of the accident scene.

Nomadlisa was sentenced to four years hard time at Chowchilla State Prison, but she was released after about eighteen months for [[cunnilingus|good behavior]]. Meanwhile, Sunny's bereaved boyfriend {{lj|dizzyspells}} continues to seek solace in the arms of any fat girl he can find.

{{squote|This was a triumph!
I'm making a note here:
"HUGE SUCCESS!!"

It's hard to overstate
my satisfaction.

Aperture Science:
We do what we must
because we can.

For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.

But there's no sense crying
over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
till you run out of cake.
And the science gets done.
And you make a neat gun
for the people who are
still alive.

I'm not even angry...
I'm being so sincere right now-
Even though you broke my heart,
and killed me.

And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you!

Now, these points of data
make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time!
So I'm GLaD I got burned-
Think of all the things we learned-
for the people who are
still alive.

Go ahead and leave me...
I think I'd prefer to stay inside...
Maybe you'll find someone else
to help you?
Maybe Black Mesa?
That was a joke! HAHA!! FAT CHANCE!!

Anyway this cake is great!
It's so delicious and moist!

Look at me: still talking
when there's science to do!
When I look out there,
it makes me GLaD I'm not you.

I've experiments to run.
There is research to be done.
On the people who are
still alive.
And believe me I am
still alive.
I'm doing science and I'm
still alive.
I feel fantastic and I'm
still alive.
While you're dying I'll be
still alive.
And when you're dead I will be
still alive.

Still alive.

Still alive.|Still alive because you had the airbag, bitch}}
