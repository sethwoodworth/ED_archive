Shock Image

[[Image:Youcantunseethis.jpg|thumb|You can't unsee this.]]
Occasionally, when you are browsing your internets safe and sound, you'll hear scratching at your window, chains rattling and your family massacred downstairs. You'll be terrified, frozen with fright. And then Goatse floods your monitor. Don't be afraid - this scenario has been played out IRL by countless internets users that happen to stumble across a '''SHOCK IMAGE'''.
Shock Images are also the number one cause in loss of childhood.

==Legendary shock images==
===Goatse===
[[Image:Hello.jpg|thumb|[[halo thar|Y HALO THAR]]]]
A picture of a [[Kirk Johnson|man]] ripping his asshole open with his hands. It is one of the most-used shock images for trolls and other internet 
criminals alike. Though today it is not the most shocking image; it has effectively desensitised many teenagers. Has been posted on [[/b/]] so many times that their [[Sick fucks|members]] generally [[fap]] to the picture. 
More information on Goatse can be found '''[[goatse|here]]'''.

===Lemonparty.org===
[[Image:Lemonparty.jpg|thumb|Old people at play]]
Shows three old men engaging in oral sex and other acts of disgusting, depraved [[faggotry]]; another fun pic to use on the kiddies. [[Culexor]] has a famed crush on it.
More information can be found '''[[Lemonparty|here]]'''.

===Tubgirl===
An [[Azn]] chick who, while bent over, projects orange juice mixed with shit from her asshole, up into the air like a fountain and splashing all over her face. This is probably the second most popular shock image since most of [[Gaia]], the self-proclaimed largest internet forum on the web, has seen it. People question its shocking value due to the mosaic covering the girl's [[pussy]].
More information can be found '''[[tubgirl|here]]'''.

===Bagslap.com/bag===
A lesser-known shock site made in the spirit of Meatspin, this still has some stealth abilities due to its ambiguous sounding name.  Shows a man with an unnaturally large ballsack cumming copious amounts of manjuice all over his genitalia area.  Particularly effective due to the compelling and thought-provoking musical score played throughout the visual display.

===LULZ.INFO===
Shows a nude woman licking multiple flaccid penises all sprouting from one man. A newer shock site reaching popularity from repeated posts on various imageboards. Still available for shock lulz.'''[[lulz.info|here]]'''.
*<s>[http://lulz.info/ link]</s> BALEETED

===HAI2U===
A [[whore]] vomiting over a man's penis while performing oral sex. According to [[/b/]], this is proper oral technique. Not as shocking as the others but when you post this in a children's forum, BAM! Before you get [[FBI|Partyvan]]'d that is.
Information can be found '''[[Hai2u|here]]'''.

==Not as popular==
[[Image:TubOBrains.jpg|thumb|The only known way to remove shock images from memory is to soak the brain in warm, soapy water for 45 minutes.]]

===Kids in Sandbox===
Perhaps, sadly, one of the most unrecognized shock sites on the internet, this is an excellent [[porn|video]] of a woman sticking a dildo all the way inside a guy's [[penis|cock]]. What a bitch!
More information can be found '''[[Kids in Sandbox|here]]'''.

===2 Girls 1 Cup===
This video depicts two sick fuck girls eating each other's [[shit]]. The video is only disturbing to [[newfags]] who were born after 1991. [http://www.2girls1cup.com 2Girls1Cup] is notable because [[faggot|Joe Rogan]] was filmed watching it.

===Meatspin===
A very [[Stupid|funny]] site showing a pre-op transexual being anally penetrated. A "Spin Count" lays under the picture while the transexual's penis spins around and around. Some say if you reach spins around the 40-50mark, the site will determine that you are [[gay]]. 
More information can be found '''[[Meatspin|here]]'''. [http://www.phonetrace.org Phonetrace.org] acts as a more discreet, and surprising, meatspin site. As does [http://www.infoslash.net Infoslash.net]. And [http://www.wowomg.com Wowomg.com].  It is used purely for [[lulz]] and by [[weaboo|gays]] who need [[fapping]] material. The owners of Meatspin have promised to release a new re-direct each month, for the convenience of trolls everywhere.

===Gardener Plants===
A slideshow of [[over 9000|over 9000]] different Shock Pics, all set to the wonderful sounds of [[Epic Win|Yakety Sax]]. It is rumored to make your [[Vagina|Penis]] grow! You can find it [http://www.gardenerplants.com Here]

===faggotry.com===
Shows what appears to be an old picture of five men anally penetrating each other. While not that shocking, can induce major amounts of drama in a homophobic forum. 

===Pain Series===
A beautiful collage of pictures dedicated to showing how pretty the internet can really be. Post this on many forums since people
need to know how gorgeous it really is. 

More information can be found '''[[Pain Series|here]]'''.

===Jizztini===
Depicts a woman who has recently taken part in a [[bukkake]] session kneeling in front of a pinball machine whilst drinking a large martini glass full of [[semen|jizz]]. 

More information can be found '''[[Jizztini|here]]'''.

===Cherrycake.org===
An autopsy photo of a man who's face has been blown apart and resembles [[delicious cake|delicious caek]]. [[Some argue|Some speculate]] that this happened because the moron confused a cigar with a firecracker, but no-one will ever know. Shows a funny-looking picture of a [[Harlequin Ichthyosis Fetus|harlequin fetus]] before displaying the man's truly beautiful face.

===Bottleguy.com===
Depicts a man (who is the same faggot as goatse, see mole above left side of anus) bent over outside with a bottle inserted into his anus, bottom first. To the seasoned shock fan, this is nothing, but it's relatively unknown and you won't find a picture of a man with a bottle in his bum anywhere else.

===Last Measure===
The ultimate in website links. When used on a n00b, most will think that they've been attacked with a virus; thusly ensuring [[lulz]] to the offender. Use it to its fullest advantage. 
More information can be found '''[[Last Measure|here]]'''.

===Lotus Breast===
A [[Photoshop]]ped image of a breast with maggot-looking things burrowed into the tit is spread by email, scarring women all over the internet.  More information can be found '''[[Lotus Breast|here]]'''.

[[Image:Typicalreaction.gif|thumb|Typical reaction to shock images]]
Here is a poem dedicated to the shock images: 

<div style="background-color: #fafaf5; border: 1px dashed blue; padding: .5em; width: 29%;">


''Pressure defeated, baptism lynching''
''sorcerer appeals the shocksite; dripendo!''
''Succor my sanity, shooing the show,''
''Harlequin Fetus ready to blow.''

''Pain incarnate, the manifest''
''Series, behold the Goat-to-the-Se;''
''and HAI2 to the U, foresight will''
''be blind from the Meat Spinning''
''on a dime to the single rhyme.''

''Fitter and waste on the once old''
''Cherrycake; go to the boat-docks''
''for Non-Jews with Bee-Cocks.''
''Revive the single strive for un-''
''prying eyes but be warned; the''
''Final Pain with its castration ties.''

''The Last Measure pact, would be''
''the last one to measure; for it is''
''the worst, the best; the unforgettable''
''pleasure to trick people bathed in high-''
''fiber ignorance to click to a once-thought''
''freedom and lead them to a damnation''
''far beyond the bend-over's abomination.''

== Shock Archives ==

For raiding we want to have the best '''shock pictars''' and stuff, amirite? Well to do this we need to make sure we have collected enough of different types to use during different site raids.

Also these shock pictures and files need to be made sure that they're optimized, the more shock pics that load in the quicker on forums the better, especially for people still on 56k, also for hosting on our own sites so they take up less space and are easier to host using up less bandwidth.

Furthermore when put into the official pack they will be put into specific categories and named to better facilitate raep and corruption with them.

=== Optimization techniques ===

Used to make sure the shock images load a little faster. The more retina burning, the better.

Filesize optimization techniques are programs or scripts that stip unneeded data from files and often compress them with special lossless algorithms (sometimes even on lossy file formats). This can be useful for saving bandwidth and especially disk space, it also speeds up the process of dealing with the files and loading them off of your disk drive (a very common bottleneck on modern computers).

If you have any knowledge of how to use the command line and the attention span to read a README, then optimizing your shit is well worth it if you have an endless quest to make your computer HARDERBETTERFASTERSTRONGER. Or if you just wanna upload a set of tits that's just slightly to big for the /hr/ board on your *chan of choice.

Some quality optimization tools include:

*[http://anonym.to/http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php ImageMagick] Does nearly fucking everything imagewise, very scriptable.
* [http://anonym.to/http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/ GIFsicle]*

* [http://anonym.to/http://upx.sourceforge.net/ Ultimate Packer for eXecutables] Takes a tiny bit of processing power to unpack the programs, but may still speed up program launch. Also useful for hiding your botnets from AV as well as decreasing their filesize.

<br/><nowiki>*</nowiki> WARNING, will make the file very hard to edit, make copies if you plan on editing and use the compressed version as the executed version for things like code. For GIF animations you should probably be fine.

^ Newfag friendly, has a [[GUI]].

$ Jewware, we need a link to a clean cracked version, preferrarably an alternative program that does the exact same thing.

==== Proper Use ====

The DO and DO NOT WANTs of your own shockpack:

* '''DO''' upload to photobuckets, imageshacks, and other free hosts
* '''DO''' upload to enemy sites if you can
* '''DO''' replace the images in a hacked Photobucket with these, keeping the filenames, so any images they linked to are now a shock image
* '''DO''' share a set of uploaded images with other trolls

* '''DO NOT''' upload and link to from a *chan
* '''DO NOT''' place on a site that has links to this wiki, a *chan, or anything that leads back to Anon

Keeping this in mind, you now have a perfect visual weapon against your foes.
