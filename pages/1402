'''Cereal Guy''' is a common reaction image that is posted by [[newfags|almost everyone]], although it can seem a little [[retard|out of place]] in [[porn|certain]] threads. Here are a few examples of how to use Cereal Guy without coming across as a complete [[idiot]]:
:*Do people [[TL;DR|ignore]] your posts? Posting an image next to them always makes them [[Shit|more interesting]].
:*Is your post important enough for the reader to stop [[OM NOM NOM NOM|eating]] their [[Al Gore|cereal]]? Post a Cereal Guy to indicate that to the reader!
:*Were you enjoying '''Reese's''' for breakfast, when you saw a thread, and your reply was [[serious business|important]] enough to interrupt you, mid-bite? Post a Cereal Guy to indicate this!
:*Write a little quote for Cereal Guy, and post him with it, to make people [[LOL]] hard.
:*Post it with things that are blatantly wrong. For instance, if someone on /s/ asks for the name of a whore, use Cereal Man to insist that it is Pussy Galore.
:*Do you think [[teh]] [[1337|C3r341 Guy]] is [[unfunny|funny]]? Post it with [[ALL CAPS|EVERY MOTHERFUCKING REPLY YOU MAKE]], and [[lulz]] will ensue.



==The Original Cereal Guy==
[http://legorobotcomics.com/?id=1 The original Cereal Guy image] is from an old [[MSPaint Relationship Thread|MS Paint comic]] about a guy on the phone with his [[girlfriend]], talking about their relationship problems.  It's that one with the Reese's Puffs cereal.  Sometime in 2009, someone took the first panel of the comic and edited it to form the current Cereal Guy image.  Since it was generally agreed upon that this was a pretty amusing image, it thus quickly became a standard in [[Anon]]'s reaction image arsenal.  The comic in question is the first image in the gallery below.

==Variations==
Once the image started to catch on, it was only natural that [[original content|variations]] would be made:
*One of these, made by a /b/tard with OCD, is a [[Star Wars|digitally remastered]] version of cereal guy. The uneven shape of Cereal Guy's head almost drove [[retard|OCD Guy]] [[batshit insane]], so after many countless hours in [[MS Paint]], he emerged with a '''[[Web 2.0]] version of Cereal Guy'''.

*Now, the first two installments of Cereal Guy were great for people who enjoy making points and arguing, but fell short in the [[pussy|silent appreciation]] category. Which is why some [[fag]] decided it was time to take Cereal Guy and [[faggotry|continue to make unfunny changes]]. The resulting '''Bubble Pipe Cereal Guy''' image depicts Cereal Guy, taking a break from eating his cereal to [[masturbation|appreciate]] the thread.  

*Finally, in order to make a [[gay|really cool]] mindfuck thread, someone [[pokemon|evolved]] Cereal Guy to his [[blastoise|final form]]. '''Cereal Guy Ninja''' involved posting the Cereal Guy 2.0 image, the phrase "nice flying kick," and the misnamed filename ''guy_holding_a_bowl_of_cereal_wearing_a_backpack_doing_a_roundhouse_kick.jpg''. Several [[newfags]] remarked on the disconnected image and post. Thus, the [[samefag|OP]] would post "now do you see it?", and the '''Cereal Guy Ninja image'''.  This variation hasn't really caught on, though.

==Continuation==
As forced memes and poor taste go, Cereal Guy has been particularly stubborn in resisting death.  He lives on in his very own low-quality [[MSPaint]] [[webcomic]].
