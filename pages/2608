Egypt is the largest province of [[Saudi Arabia]] its populatation is thought to number somewhere in the region of 10 buzzillion E-Gypsies all of which own at least 10 cell phones and 33 [[Twatter|Twitter]] accounts per rag-head. Egypt was once an empire ruled over by all powerful race of super [[White People|Aliens]] and was known for its magnificent, far-reaching civilization and complex [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile sewer network]. Over 9000 years ago Egypt earned infinite special bonus points for making a bunch [[Palestinians|terrorists]] butthurt when the great [[Hitler|Pharaoh]] drove a herd of [[Jews|Golden Egg Laying Geese]] out of Egypt and accross the Red Sea.


By the third century B.C., it was known only for [[Bestiality|Camels]]. Since then, Egypt has been [[pwned]] by [[Greece|the Greeks]], [[Iran|the Persians]], [[Rome|the Romans]], [[Muhammad]], [[Turkey|the Ottoman Turks]], [[France|the French]], [[England|the English]], [[Israel|the Israelis]] and probably [[you]]. 


In 1979 or thereabouts, Egypt became the first [[Arab]] state to sign a peace treaty with [[Israel]] when Jimmy Carter asked Prime Minister Sadat real polite-like to do so. Now the Egyptians have nothing to do. Shukran, rafiki, you need taxi? Change money? Bitrol? I can obtain for you this bitrol, okay, let's go.


Today Egypt is mostly known for its many bus crashes involving western tourists. If you see an E-Gypsie that isnt rolling dung with his legs into a gigantic ball, make sure you are carrying luggage as they will either think its a suitcase bomb destined for Israel or a chance to earn some [[Jew Gold|shekels]] and instinctively offer to carry it up to your room for pocket change.
==Ancient Egypt==

The original E-Gypsies built many technological wonders, assisted by [[slavery|some shit noone gives a fuck about]]. They also invented [[furries|furry buttsecks]] and perfected the art of [[necrophilia|Mummification]] for the purpose of supporting its only functioning economy, the tourism and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bates_Motel.jpg hospitality industry].

==[[Shit no one cares about|Famous Pharaohs]]==

During ancient times, Egypt was not ruled by the [[Arabs]] but rather by [[furries|Egyptians]]. Listed here are some of the most famous ones.

* Narmer, the founder of Egypt. Obviously the biggest [[furries|furry]] of them all.
* Pepi II, famed for having 3pic [[buttsex|buttsecks]] with his General repeatedly, which caused his death in the 96th year of his reign.
* Hatshepsut, the first known feminist, who's hobbies included [[pwning]] her stepson Thutmose III because he was [[man|MALE]] and crossdressing.
* Akhenaten, a man whose severe daddy issues and hatred of the normal Egyptian practice of worshiping [[furries]] led him to create a new [[religion]] centered on worshiping Aten, the sun disc. Unfortunately for Akhenaten the normal Egyptian population enjoyed jerking off to statues of Thoth too much to convert, and they [[pwning|pwned]] his monuments after his death. Akhenaten was also a family man who loved to have sex with his young female children. Unrelated, but still amusing, if his remaining monuments are anything to go by, he had an even bigger chin than [[Jay Leno]].
* King Tut was made famous for having lots of cool stuff buried with him when he died. Other than that, his [[over 9000|power lvl]] was basically 0.
* Ramses the Great's pastimes including [[at least 100|counting his children]] and [[pwning]] the rest of the known world. Some people think he was the first one who had to deal with the [[Jews]] thinking that they had [[1337]] skillz that made them better than everyone else.
* Nectanebo II, the last native pharaoh of Egypt before Persia fucked his shit up. Also notable for being a creepy little fucker, some sources suggest he would [[necro|whisper commands to people he killed]], and tell them to do what he wanted in the underworld.
* Cleopatra was the last pharaoh of Egypt. She is known for molesting her little brother, then banging two famous Roman guys for power. One day she [[accidentally]] a snake, and ended up dead. Though it is thought it may have been [[Suicide|on purpose]] due to a turning point in the war.

*[[Mubarak|Mubarak]], [[over 9000|longest-reigning]] dictator-pharaoh in modern Egypt, well-known for his brutal army of police mercenary. and a major [[anti-lulz|anti-lulz]] advocate.

==Pyramids==
E-Gypsies were once recognised as some of the greatest builders of penis monuments and hillarious gigantic angular b00bies to [[true|evar live]]. This tradition of phalic and titty idolisation has since phased into dormancy due to the fact that the original E-Gypsies ran out of [[Jew Gold|Mana nuggets]] during the [[Holocaust|Great Wild Goose Chase]] and they also converted from win to fail by adopting the religion of local rednecked [[Arabs|terrorists]]. Without the potent spell accelerating [[Jew Gold|Mana nuggets]] in the E-Gypsies possession they were unnable to bewitch the standing army of [[Niggers|labourers]] into moon cricket form, the only productive form they are known to have.

Did you know? Pyramids were also used to store both [[Dead Nigger Storage|dead]] and [[Fritzl|living]] people within amongst the accumulated treasures of the greatest of the [[Yu-Gi-Oh|Egyptian Pharaohs]]. Most of which were later [[leeching|borrowed]] and [[true|preserved]] a few thousand years later by the original [[White People|Egyptians]]. E-Gypsies abiding by their new ghey [[Islam|religion]] began to take greater interest in [[Pedophilia|Aisha]] lolis and thus stopped tending to the pyramids, they wound up crumbling to shit. [http://images.google.ca/images?hl=en&q=Nubian%20Pyramids&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi The Nubians tried to build pyramids, but failed horribly.] Today, the remaining wonders of the Ancient world have been conquered by tourists in Hawaiian shirts and Arab wanting to make a buck guiding them around on starving camels.


==2011 Cairo==

In January of 2011 the E-Gypsies decided living on U.N welfare handouts like a bunch of [[niggers]] was [[fail]], so much so that it would be nice to give anyone with a television set around the world something [[lulz|back]]. So they set about to instigate a Greater Egyptian renaisence of arts, [[shit|culture]] and traditional Egyptian [[fail|values]]. The E-Gypsies, being today a good Allah fearing group of closet terrorists still largely unfamiliar with the ways of old decided to start the process of renewal off by relearning the basics of [[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy|Freemasonry]].

Do note in great respect for the ancient Egyptian tradition the builders of penis monuments must also [[An Hero]] themselves during the erection process.</center>
