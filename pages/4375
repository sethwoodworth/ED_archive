Anyone that's been on the [[internets]] for any length of time knows that strange things happen here quite often. Hanging out on the [[series of tubes|Information Superhighway]] is a lot like hanging out on Hollywood Boulevard, anything can happen here at any time. Most wide eyed [[netizens]] have yet to watch [[To Catch a Predator|Chris Hansen]] or seen ED's own article on [[pedophiles]] so they don't understand what happens here, that they think the sickest fucks on the internets are the ones who post [[goatse]], [[tubgirl]], or [[Mr. Hands]]. Still, every once in a great while something will happen here that's so enlightnening that it makes the most noobish [[newfags]] say "[[omgwtfbbq]]" and then they realize what an ocean of piss the internet really is. 


Enter <b>John Forehand</b>. John, for all intents and purposes, seemed to be an average joe. His marriage had split up a few years back, but other than that he appeared to be fairly [[boring|typical]]. Working at his job as a bowling alley maintenance man, to the casual observer, his life looked quite ordinary. Then one day John thought it would be a good idea to e-[[stalk]] his estranged 13 year old biological daughter on [[Facebook]] and [[wtf|proposition her to have sex with him]].

John sent his daughter several messages on Facebook describing to her in graphic detail the things he wanted to do to her. They were so [[kinky|explicit]] that the girl had to look many of them up.

Once she understood what her dad was actually suggesting, the girl immediately showed the bizarre messages to her mom, who in turn showed them to the [[police|po-po]]. The police then took over the girl's Facebook, and continued to message with John, pretending that they were her. John suggested picking her up after school one day so he could take back to her house and live out his fantasies. The police, posing as the girl, agreed to the meeting. His last message to her was:

Upon taking Forehand into custody, authorities searched John's car and found a [[sick fuck|camera, a tripod, and an unopened box of condoms]]. Similar items, along with a computer, were also found in his mobile home.
