Ragequit
{{finalsolutions}}

'''Ragequitting''' is the act of giving up in a [[butthurt]] manner when [[you]] [[fail]] at the [[internet]] or [[life]]. Sometimes it is accompanied by a [[TLDR|long-winded]] [[flounce]]. It is commonly the desired end-result of any particular [[troll]], ragequitting is the [[internet]] equivalent to giving everyone the middle-finger before slamming the door and going off to drown your sorrows in [[alcohol]].

==[[Typical]] ragequitters==
[[You|Your typical ragequitter]] is often either [[emo]] or a [[n00b]]. They feel that [[Paranoid|everyone is conspiring against them]] and spend [[over 9000]] hours contemplating how to get back at everyone. They attempt to [[troll]], but inevitably end up failing quite hard. Ragequitters will quickly [[STFU|shut the fuck up]] when they get the last word in. This never really happens, so it's hard to differentiate these people from [[attention whores]]. This fact is great ammunition for causing much butthurt and, subsequently, a [[Roflcopter| cavalcade of lulz]].

==How to Ragequit==

===IRC===
 /quit rage

===Livejournal/Youtube===
''See [[delete fucking everything]]''

===4chan===
[[CP]] EVERYWHERE

===Life===
Did you lose your [[job]], your [[Girlfriend|Girl]] and you fear your [[Mitchell_Henderson|iPod]] will soon follow? Hey! Things could be worse! After all, downers are just a part of the ride. But if you want off early, make sure you remember to separate yourself from regular [[an heroes]] by applying [[Columbine|splash damage]] first. Oh, and also make sure you have it down on record that you're [[I_did_it_for_the_lulz|doing it for the lulz]] so we'll know which way to bias your article.

===Left 4 Dead===
Any time you quit the game, you are forced to ragequit. No exceptions. The only possible way out of this would be to give up your personal life, job, or lover and actually finish the campaign, but after that you might not have anything left to go back to.
