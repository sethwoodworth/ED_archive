'''California [[Republican]] state Senator Roy Ashburn''' (moar like ASS-burn amirite?) of Bakersfield took leave from his elected position in early March, 2010. After partying all night at a homosexual hotspot, he took off in his car, but was soon [[v&|arrested]] for drunk-driving.

The funny part is that Ashburn&mdash;55 years old, but with the hot, ripped bod of a 54 year old&mdash;has consistently voted against bills that would expand legal protections for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Californians. The single [[adopted|"father of four children"]]  is one of the most hardcore anti-fag politicians.

Assburn joins a very long list of Republican [[Larry Craig|toilet goblins]], [[Richard Curtis|fetishists]] and [[Bob Allen|other homosexual perverts]] who were forced to resign in disgrace.

==Hammer time==

Ashburn was arrested and booked into Sacramento County jail on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol just after 2 a.m. Wednesday and a local television station cited unnamed sources in reporting that Ashburn had spent the evening at [[Coprophagia|Faces]], a large gay dance club a few blocks from where police stopped him. Ashburn was driving his state-issued vehicle.

That night, the club drew large crowds for a Miss Gay Latina drag-party. Sources have told the San Francisco Chronicle that they have seen Ashburn regularly at gay clubs and bars near Faces. Capitol staffers say it is an open secret that Ashburn frequently visits Sacramento's gay establishments.

==Deeply sorry==

Ashburn could not be reached for comment. His staff said they have not had contact with him since the day before the arrest, although the office did release a statement from the senator regarding his arrest that read: "I am deeply sorry for my actions and offer no excuse for my poor judgment. I accept complete responsibility for my conduct and am prepared to accept the consequences for what I did."

Ashburn has voted against bills establishing same-sex marriage, banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in businesses and strengthening anti-bullying and harassment protections for gay kids in public schools.

Equality California, the state's leading gay rights lobbying organization, has consistently given Ashburn a zero percent rating in its annual scorecard of lawmakers' votes on gay rights. Geoff Kors, the executive director of Equality California, said Ashburn has "one of the worst records of anyone in the Legislature" on expanding rights for LGBT people.

Charles [[moron|Moran]], spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, a national gay Republican organization, said it is common for conservatives who are not out about their sexual orientation to vote against expanding gay rights.

==Totally hottt==

"A lot of people who are closeted homosexuals think it will give them cover, but instead it increases the heat," Moran said.

He said "the scandal will continue as long as he continues to be dodgy about personal aspects of his life."

==Admits faggotry!==

In a rare move for a Republitard, Assburn admitted his folly one week after his arrest: "I am gay. And so, those are the words that have been so difficult for me for so long." Ashburn made this announcement radio to host Inga [[dog|Barks]] on her show on the KERN radio station in Bakersfield.

Immediately, no-one gave a shit about that. The fact remains, however, that Ashburn was driving while drunk. Motherfucker could have killed somebody! How many hundreds if not thousands of other drunk-driving escapades did he commit and NOT get busted?

Ashburn continued: [[Unrealistic expectations|"I pray to God that I can find peace and I want to go back to work in the Senate and work hard for the people who sent me to the Legislature,"]] he said.
