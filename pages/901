Michael J. [[Fox]] is the primary answer to the question: "Hey ([[you]])...what's shakin'?"

Apart from that, he was previously an un-shaky actor who once played Marty McFly in ''Back to the Future'', as well as the main (un-shaky) guy from some old sitcom or something. At least 100 years ago, Fox got the Parkinson's and now he's a [[Crips|crippled]], barely coherent puppet for the pro-stem cell research activists. And shaky.

== Faking It? ==
[[Fat]], [[Conservative]] ass-fuck Rush Limbaugh, says that Michael J. Fox was a [[furry]] who was faking it in his [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9WB_PXjTBo hilarious campaign ad]. He also claimed that Marty devoured whole fetuses for sustenance, much in the same way as "The Incredible Melting Man." He argues that he shakes because he deliberately stopped taking his medication. The medication is what makes him shaky instead of a vegetable, and that makes Rush Limbaugh an even bigger ass-fuck.

Reading the comments on that video is top priority. They're so fucking funny it'll make you want to kill the author who disabled any new ones from coming in. Please.
