[[Image:Nothing alike 75.jpg|thumb|You can do this with any character from any Final Fantasy and get similar results.]]

[[Trolls|Square-Enix]], being the [[EA|brilliant developers]] that they are, came out with an innovative new battle system that consists entirely of [[God of War|repeatedly mashing X]]. Much like rush mode in other games, the [[Cleverbot|AutoBattle]] command will stock abilities that are super effective against the generic [[Street Fighter|palatte swap]] enemy you happen to be grinding, No thinking required. Much to the dismay of [[fags|PS3 fanboys]] Square-Enix announced that ''Final Fantasy XIII'' would no longer be a [[AIDS|PS3 exclusive]] and would released on the [[Xbox 360|360]] due to the fact that [[PS3|The PSTriple]] has no gaems, The 360 version includes 3 discs primary due to the limits of [[vista|Microsoft tech]]. Drama ensued after the revelation that there are no towns, and that the over world map consists entirely of a [[series of tubes]]. Code word Linear, A [[over 9000|myriad]] of threads had emerged bashing the games for areas that were [[avatar (movie)|complete shit with shiny graphics]] along with the standard [[gamefags|n00b]] topics of [[Dragon Age: Origins|which console had the better version]]. SE also had the brilliant idea that [[digimon|transformation]] [[sailor moon|sequences]] are balls to the wall awesome, so all the summons now have [[transformers|gestalt mode]]. The game doesn't even let you pick your party until about 20 hours in, fully heals you after each battle, has no mp, and lets you [[bioshock|revive after any failed battle]]; ''FFXIII'' assumes you are a complete retard and if you bought this game you probably are. In all honesty this 'game' is easily the worst in the Final Fantasy series to date and is equally as dissapoint as [[Bioshock]] [[shit|2]].

==Story==
[[Image:ffxiiiloli.png|thumb|Hope and Vanille are greeted by a horde of [[double nigger|Cieth]].]]
[[Image:turtle.png|thumb|left|↑↑↑ Yeah, you're fucked.]]
The story is a war of two worlds, Cocoon a [[New Jersey|gleaming utopia]] built by [[Xenu|fal'Cie]] and [[vibrator|Pulse]] the hellish lower world which is pretty much [[New Zealand]]. Hokay so here's the Earth [[at least 100 years ago|once upon a time]] everyone lived on [[New Zealand]] and shit sucked so the [[Jesus|fal'Cie]] created a magic happy land in the sky, [[Christianity|sound familiar]], but only [[white people|certain people]] got to live in paradise. Well [[orgasm|Pulse]] was [[Serious Business|fuckin' pissed]] so they [[flame|waged war]] the only way Azns know how, by [[Power Rangers|turning into a giant monster]]. The fal'Cie have the power to [[what is a man?|steal men's souls, and make them their slaves!]] The slave is hereby referred to as [[wiccan|l'Cie]] and is given a [[jihad|focus]], if it is completed the slave will [[statuephilia|petrify into crystal]] if not the slave will turn into a [[Juliana Wetmore|zombie abomination]]. Our main bro Snow is on a chase from [[Chris Hansen]] after he asked his [[loli|14 year old]] girlfriend to marry him. Being the genius he is, Snow puts [[hipster|Serah]] on a 500 foot high ledge which just happened to belong to a fal'Cie. [[terrorists|Our heroes]] valiantly attempt to rescue [[jailbait|Serah]] by killing all military personnel in their way. They end up getting cursed by fal'Cie, Oh and also Serah dies but no one cares about that. The space pope reveals that he is [[duh|fal'Cie]] and wants to destroy the world for no adequately explored reason. So after the typical rpg final boss rant, "come on guise this thing doesn't have a right to exist!" "Lol, that's just what I said at my last abortion" our righteous heroes manage to break the final boss's immortality with their [[falcon punch|special move]] and save the world. But without the fal'Cie [[9/11|Cocoon fell out of the sky]]. The two lesbians from [[New Zealand|Pulse]] activated their wonder twin powers and transform into a [[Cthulhu|giant tentacle monster]] and manage to [[wut|freeze the world to the sky]] and save the day. [[no|Aren't you glad you read all that]]? It's from [[Japan]]. What did you [[tentacle rape|expect]]?

==Main Characters==
===[[Doesn't afraid of anything|Lightning]]=== 
[[Image:lolpunch.gif|thumb|left|[[Domestic violence|Lightning keeps her bitches in line.]]]]
[[Image:odin.png|thumb|right|Always I wanna be with you and make believe with you]]
The [[technical virgin|technical leader]] and head bitch in charge, an [[Ex-Gay|ex-commando]] who wants revenge because her sister [[Heath Ledger|died]]. She is a strong independent woman who is afraid to show off her [[dat ass|softer side]]. Light is loose cannon who doesn't play by [[rules of the internet|the rules]], she does what she wants, how she wants, and who she wants. She uses the [[anon|alias]] Lightning to sound edgy and mysterious but the bad guys have a secret weapon, [[Powerword]]: Claire (And in japan Eclair... cuz that's a legitimate name) She wields a fancy new weapon that is a [[Final Fantasy VIII|blade that fires bullets]] as well as [[Ipad|elite advanced technology]] that allows her to [[divide by zero|defy gravity]]. When Hope tells her he plans to kill Snow she [[do it faggot|gives him a knife]]. Lightning doesn't need any friends cause they will only slow her down.
;[[robot unicorn attack|Odin]]: A [[Internet Tough Guy|white knight]] that attacks enemies with his [[cock|mighty lance]]. He [[furry|transforms into a horse]] and Lighting [[mr. hands|mounts him for a fierce assault]]. He is [[copypasta|similar to]] Ixion from FFX, and shares the same lighting attribute... oh he is a lighting type cause her name is Lightning, [[get out|hahaha that's funnay guise]]. Lighting summons him when she tells Hope to [[Fuck off]] and she doesn't want to [[deeker|babysit]] him anymore.

===[[Fried chicken|Sazh]]=== 
[[Image:sazh.png|thumb|left|[[X? in my Y?|Chocobo? In my afro?]]]]
[[Image:sazhsummon.png|thumb|right|Flaming in more ways than one]]
The first [[nigra]] to appear in the series due to [[Obama|affirmative blacktion]]. Seeing as how there are no black people in Japan, he is a compilation of what Azns [[Dave Chapelle|assume black people are like]], the creator admitted to basing him off [[Isaac Hayes|Lionel Ritchie]]. Sazh is the [[Tosh.0|comic relief]] party member as he has a chocobo that lives in his fro and is supa [[kawaii]]. Sazh is the only person to understand that [[BRILLIANT!|guns>swords]]. He goes to an amusement park with Vanille while everyone else is trying to save the world. After leaving the petting zoo, Sazh learns that Vanille is the reason the [[KKK|government]] confiscated and ate his son. He considers shooting her but pussies out saying, "lot of things [[holocaust|can be excused]],  [[VTech|shooting kids]] ain't one."
;[[kill it with fire|Brynhildr]]: A contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race, he/she/we is a flaming queen complete with high heels and crown. It carries a giant executioner's axe, It's the new black, Sazh is the old black. It transforms into a drop top car so that the [[not racist]] nigra can perform drive byes. The trap appeared before Sazh after Vanille [[I accidentally X|accidentally his son]]. Sazh was going to shoot her, but he learned from [[OJ]] that killing a white woman wouldn't end well, for her at least.

===[[Bogan|Snow]]=== 
[[Image:snowbrand.png|thumb|left|[[holocaust|l'Cie are branded so they can be easily identified.]]]]
[[Image:shivacycle.png|thumb|right|Take a [[secks|ride]] on the [[rimjob|shivacycle]]]]
A [[fag|Seifer]] wannabe, he started his own militia but that doesn't matter as they aren't seen after the tutorial. He is nicknamed [[cock|Mr. 12cm]] (that's 4in for the [[murka|murkans]]) by the [[script kiddies|crew]]. Snow is engaged to Lightning's [[bioshock|little sister]] and frequently calls Lightening his [[bro|sis]]. Lightning is not amused with Snow's faggotry and proceeds to assault him in the face. Snow frequently [[tool|raises his fist in the air and punches his palm]] which means it's go time. Snow serves no purpose other than to [[fanservice|take off his shirt]].
;[[twincest|Shiva Sisters]]: Double your pleasure double your fun. Since Shiva is an [[starfox|extremely overused]] summon, there is now 200% moar Shiva for your enjoyment. [[some argue|Many believe]] that their names are Nix and Stiria, but that is incorrect as women do not have names. Shiva came to Snow when the military confiscated Serah's body for [[skullfuck|scientific testing]], but Snow wasn't done with it yet. The sisters transform into a motorcycle that [[x-men|rides on ice beams]].

===[[Disney|Vanille]]=== 
[[Image:vanille.png|thumb|left|[[Cock goes where?]]]]
[[Image:hecatoncheir.png|thumb|right|[[How do I shot web?|How do i shot lazerz?]]]]
The typical anime [[orihime|airhead]] that always [[aspergers|overreacts with weird gestures]], her weapon is a [[lol wut|fishing rod]] and she believes all of life's problems can be solved with friendship and the [[the secret|power of positive thinking]]. She and Fang have spent hundreds of years in [[star wars|frozen carbonite]] after completing their primary objective, and they somehow ended up on Cocoon for no apparent reason. She is also the narrator which is very unfortunate as you have to [[pain series|hear her speak lots and lots]], she has a very hard time maintaining an Australian accent and somehow mixes it up with a touch of southern gentlemen. Vanille decides it would be a good idea to [[genius|follow a black man alone into the woods]]. Somehow she ends up not getting raped and goes to an amusement park with her new black friend while everyone else is off trying to [[fundies|save the world]].
;[[Tentacle rape|Hecatoncheir]]: A monster whose name is unpronounceable, Vanille only says the first half and gives up. It has [[over 9000]] arms that he can shoot into the ground for a surprise attack. He transforms into a [[/k/|double barrel Gatling gun]] that attacks with [[metroid|lazers and missiles]]. His special attack is a [[hiroshima|nuclear explosion]] that makes Vanille tingle with excitement. Vanille summons him when Fang learns the [[jews did 9/11|truth behind the attack]] on Cocoon [[last Thursday|hundreds of years ago]].

===[[Steve Irwin|Fang]]===
[[Image:Ffxiiiles.png|thumb|left|Fang protecting her bitch.]]
[[Image:bahamut.png|thumb|right|[[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|Imma chargin mah maega flair]]]]
Fang is one hardcore lesbian and will fuck your shit up. She apologizes to Lighting for ruining her sister, then says that she doesn't feel any better. Lighting raeges that Fang only apologized to relieve guilt and doesn't actually care, [[psychology|which is the only reason anyone apologizes ever]], so she punches Fang and says that didn't make her feel any better, for the lulz. Fang was originally [[Kim Petras|developed to be a man]] but the developers decided that [[The OC|hot lesbians would sell better]]. She works with the military because Cid Raines is a l'Cie sympathizer. She doesn't really care about anyone except, she'd "[[faggotry|tear down the sky to save Vanille]]". The final boss repeatedly kills fang and revives her to [[IDIFTL|piss off Vanille]]
;[[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|Bahamut]]: [[Oprah|Every Final Fantasy gets a free Bahamut]]!!!1!11! Another summon obligated to please the fans which is ironic since SE doesn't seem to care about their fans(see rest of article). A kickass dragon whose attacks cause a lot of [[lensflare]] and [[za warudo|inverted colors]]. Its special attack is a giant lazer that creates a [[Michael Bay|massive explosion]]. He transforms into some kind of [[star wars|hover scooter]] and comes to Fang when she decides that she really doesn't care if the world dies in a nuclear explosion as long as she doesn't die with it.

===[[Megan Meier|Hope]]=== 
[[Image:hope.png|thumb|left|Hope with a glowing lotus flower, because he wasn't [[gay]] enough already.]]
[[Image:alexander.png|thumb|right|Castle Crashers]]
A [[shota|13-15 year old boy]] whose clothes and personality suggest he is an avid [[crunkcore]] fan. His mom volunteers to be in [[nazi|Snow's militia]] but Snow tells her to gb2 [[kitchen]]. She saves his ass with a rocket launcher only to die seconds later([[Bitches don't know|Bitches don't know bout phoenix down]]). Since Hope's mom volunteered and since Snow is the leader of Team NORA(a japanizu reference to a [[cat|stray]]: the English version just gets the acronym No Obligations, Rules, or Authority), it's his fault the bitch didn't duck and cover. Also Hope's mom is named Nora(OMG Irony). Hope descends into the darkness that is [[emo|Cloudsyndrome]] and decides to murder Snow [[for great justice]]. He of course fails and decides that Snow is an [[pretty cool guy]].
;[[glomp|Alexander]]: Alexander is a [[boring|standard non-elemental golem]]. Like Hope he is generally considered useless and transforms into a castle that fires lazer cannons which may sound cool, but doesn't deal very much damage. Hope is the only character whose summon does not change into a vehicle so it will be useless in the soon to be announced Final Fantasy Kart: Versus Grand Prix. Hope first awakens Alexander when he realizes that [[truth|he is useless and only holding everyone back]] and that there is no hope(bad pun used a lot in game) and all is lost.

===[[Pope|Barthandelus]]===
[[Image:Barthandelus.jpg|thumb|left|Of course he's the Pope! He's got the funny hat and magic wand!]]
[[Image:Orphan.png|thumb|right|He transforms into [[original character|Orphan]] some fused composite enemy, that's refreshing]]
An [[lemonparty|elderly gentleman]] who is the Primarch, which is really just a fancy word for space pope. He is perhaps the lamest final boss in all of final fantasy as he is a steaming pile of plot hole and has no personality. His job is to protect Cocoon, but he wants the [[reptoids|l'Cie]] to destroy it because he isn't allowed to harm people, even though he killed all his own henchmen. He wants to asplode the world to cause the rapture and bring back the one true lord and make a [[Ron Paul|perfect new world]]. He wants Lighting to [[jihad]] Coccon [[retard|and yet he still attempts to murder her numerous times]]. He is teh ultimate bad guy mainly because the heroes couldn’t find [[sephiroth|anyone better]]. When the final boss of a game is suicidal and has been so for the past 20 hours, you really have to wonder whats the fucking point.

Barthandelus has also been know to declare [[No Niggers|code white]].

[[Image:FFXIII Graph.png|thumb|right|Game's plot quality over time.  Note how it never reaches that of a book.]]





Any other characters are not important enough to warrant their own section. Mostly because they only have 5 minutes of screen time and this game has no plot. See graph for details.


==Game Mechanics==
Game play consists of running through a [[series of tubes]] until you find [[delicious cake|X]]. Don’t be fooled however, as [[/x/|X]] can only be:
#A short cutscene where everyone talks about their [[period|feelings]]
#A needless uninspired boss fight that leads to the next area where you

Rinse and repeat for about 25 hours until you get to the wide open spaces where you have generic kill the enemy quests, or you quit playing this trash and do something better, highly unlikely.

Why this game is particularly [[special]].

Square decided to troll the fuck out of their fans by removing a great deal of attributes that previously seemed to be a requirement for a successful RPG, such as [[role-playing]], towns to [[raid|explore]], and NPCs to [[rape|talk to]]. No backtracking allowed(why would anyone want to), and no MP so the game isn't too hard for the [[13 year old boys|dedicated fans]]. 
Aside from not being able to escape battles SE also thought save points are still a good idea, despite the fact that dying causes no penalty whatsoever. Exp comes in the form of item drops which upgrade weapons, although the game can easily be beaten with [[n00b|level 1 equipment]] making this unnecessary and useless. Newly added is a ranking system that gives you a star rating [[X-Play|out of 5]] for how fast you kicked ass, the rating doesn't increase exp or rare items drops and is only really there for [[360 kid|achievement/trophy whores]].

===Paradigm System===
[[Image:crystallvl.png|thumb|right|It's a grid but with crystals!!]]

It's a [[GRIDS|grid]] where the player activates nodes to learn abilities and increase attributes... wait this sounds kinda familiar(Final Fantasy X). The class system has been removed for a more [[hurr|user friendly]] version in which any player can do anything whatsoever but only in theory.  In reality each character will only be decent at 2 of their 3 default jobs as the others are watered down with no useful abilities and spend an absurd amount of time earning exp called [[CP|Crystal Points]] yes rly(when out of exp the game states "you have no [[CP]]", although we all know that isn't true). On top of this the characters can't even use their non default classes until right before the final boss at which point there is no reason to know said spells in the first place. SE encourages players to be creative and [[bisexual|experiment]] with different class combos although [[99.9%]] of the time you will be using warrior/mage/healer. The only time to really use different classes is to have a sentinel guard while you spam death, [[Innovation]]!11!!!1

[[TL;DR]]: Instead of Healers casting support skills there are now two separate classes just for [[fail|casting status spells]].

==Theme song==
Square-enix is proud to announce that the theme song is a [[Coldplay|power ballad]] called
"[[masturbate|My Hands]]" by Leona Lewis, that chick that sang [[period|Bleeding Love]]

{{warning|This song will cause irreversible faggotry.}}
