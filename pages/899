'''Bebo''' is a sanctuary for [[suicide|suicidal]] youths and [[camwhores]] who think they are cult enthusiasts who discuss and enact the most gruesome way to become [[an hero|an heroes]]. Unlike MySpace, there is no semblance of order on bebo and any abuse thrown out by any user is completely ignored by the phantom ''admins'' the site is supposedly managed by. For some reason, the majority of users are from the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]]. Be warned - to read many Bebo pages, you will need a code-cracker due to the bizarre mangling of the English language therein. The majority of girl users on Bebo think it is SUPEH CUUL to take pics of themselves with a mobile phone while looking into a mirror. Not realizing how much of a twat it makes them look. It is mainly populated by chavs and lesser emos who all proclaim themselves to be [[Retard|special]] and unique.

==zOMGz NEWSFLASH - Bebo Death Cult!==
[[Image:Sxiwildchild.jpg|right|thumb|140px|[[camwhore]] much?]]
[[Image:Bebo_death_cult.jpg|thumb|140px|right|An hero, every one.]]

[[Last Thursday]] a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[16 year old girl]] known on Bebo as "sxiwildchild" joined six other emofags from her village in becoming [[an hero]], triggering yet another [[old media]] [[Zerg rush]] to blame the [[Internets]] for all the world's [[fail]], because, like, they all used the same social networking site and the Internets are evil.

Naturally, this immediately lead to such lulzworthy comments from politicians and police as "''I'm particularly concerned about this false romanticism of the memory wall that seems to have set up on Bebo giving some sort of romantic idea of suicide and not conveying the huge tragedy and wasted lives that we are looking at here''" and "''we urge parents to be vigilant''". [[PROTIP]], we're talking about kids from [[Wales]] here, their lives weren't set to amount to a huge deal in the first place. More importantly, what the fuck were they doing with computers in the first place? It's not like there's any electricity there to run them on.

Following this latest suicide, sxiwildchild's [[BFF]] decided she [[attention whores|wanted some of the action]] too, so indulged in a little light [[cutting|self harm]]. This conclusively proves that Bebo will be the starting point of the forthcoming [[final solution|Emogeddon]].

==OH SHIIIIII-==
The moralfags of [[Fags|A Bebo Concerned]] have taken it upon themselves to baww to the party van over their repeated rape at the hands of the aforementioned trolls, many accounts have been banned and locked, pending 'investigation' by the Police, which are British - so there is no need to be concerned for the trolls.  
Around 30 trolls have been felled in battle.

Apparently however, it was not the bawwing of [[Fags|A Bebo Concerned]] that drew the police to investigate, it was actually some CP stored on some [[4chan|Pedos]] account.

==Phantom Admins==
Although the site says it possesses admins or people with positions of equal importance, this is simply [[lies|untrue]], no one cares enough about the kids of Bebo to protect them from the true horrors of the [[internet]] and save them from [[an hero|an heriosm]] to come in later life. On rare occasions, these mythical creatures will creep out of their holes and take up the [[banhammer]] because you were reported for supporting [[Fags|Leeds United]]. If you appeal, you will receive an automated message informing you that the matter is closed. You can either continue appealing to these microchips and wires for your account or, if you aren't sick of Bebo already, spend 3 minutes making a new one.

==Troll bait==
Bebo is known to have easy targets for trolling, such as the infamous [[Fail|Chris Falconer]], who often spammed numerous debate-orientated groups with his [[Emo|Socialist]] rhetoric and finally had enough when a certain user [[Lulzcow|caught him with his pants down]] and as a result he permanently [[Pussy|fucked off]] due to being pwned too hard. Another infamous user would be [[Fucktard|Sare Heed]], a 30 year old [[Junkie|drug user]] who openly admitted to being a dole-sponger and [[Fail|proud of it]], and when Hank Palooka trolled him to [[An hero|death]] he threatened to [[Internet tough guy|beat his ass]], the result was a barrage of lulz which only made poor Sare Heed more [[Emo|frustrated]].

==Conspiracy fags==
A small minority of Bebo's population believe that the [[Retard|world is ruled by lizards]], and these certain people have many similarities, such as habits like [[Junkie|taking drugs]], being [[Good|Jew haters]], [[pretty cool guy|having no fear when people troll them]], not being [[13 year old boys|able to speak proper English]], and black person.

==Memorial groups==
The majority of the groups on Bebo consist of memorials for an heroes that have passed before us, and these are very pitiful as every [[underage]] boy or girl on the internet swarms to apologize poorly of e-weep over the death of an unloved one. All the other groups are just a poorly seasoned user of [[internet|the tubes]] pretending to be a [[shit bands|shit band]] and lauding gr8ness and [[cocks|rock out]] but everyone knows [[shit|Fall out Boy]] and [[shit|Marylin Manson]] don't use Bebo.
Many lolfags such as polish memeigrants DO use bebo, such as this young Bumlover and his douche-patrol friends http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=17901174

==Typing==
of course the most important part of any bebo profile is how you type your profile or comments

there's the
Y0z cUZZy BrO Ims Da stuPIDs as NIGger (also applied by white trash)

or
†hê ¢ðñ£µ§ïñg §hï† ñð ðñê ¢åñ rêåÐ (also popular with niggers and white trash)

or the ever popular
<strike>haha try reading my profile with lines through all the words</strike>

and we can't forget
[x] im emo \F/
(or something like that im not emo so i don't know how to type like a fucking retard)

==LOL ART THIEVES==
On June 22nd, 2007, [[Kawaii Kitsune]] posted a [http://news.deviantart.com/article/30448/ news item] on [[DeviantART]] about how many members of bebo went and "stole" mediocre art of both official and [[recolor|fan characters]] created by [[Chris-Chan|shit ''Sonic'' artists]], recoloring them badly and claiming that it was theirs. It goes to show how much [[fail]] bebo is... they fail so much at art (and life) that they can't even summon enough creative energy to create their own shitty ''Sonic'' recolors with [[animu]] hair and [[boobs]]. Instead, they have to steal the shitty recolors made by tartlets. But the [[butthurt]] that resulted makes the victims of the theft just as much fail. 

While a few non-fail tartlets pointed out that [http://comments.deviantart.com/2/30448/498256763 fan characters are already unimaginative as it is] and [http://comments.deviantart.com/2/30448/536207557 that they should stop], most of them displayed the typical [[butthurt]] and [[Internet tough guy]] comments, as well as pointing out the obvious.

A few of the [[lulz]]iest comments:
*[http://comments.deviantart.com/2/30448/505341513 Oh noes he's gonna rip out their colons!]
*[http://comments.deviantart.com/2/30448/499836298 ANTI-ART-THIEVES TO THE RESCUE!!!!1one]
*[http://comments.deviantart.com/2/30448/512939811 Why this guy thought anyone would steal his shit is beyond me.]
*[http://comments.deviantart.com/2/30448/529938398 The irony here is almost sickening.]
*[http://comments.deviantart.com/2/30448/530132105 OMG HE KNOWS A 1337 H4X0R THEY'RE GONNA GET IT NOW]

Also, it seems that most skins on Bebo are actually ripped off from design site such as Naked and Angry, and Threadless. Shows how much effort these fuckers they put in the skins. Most of the time, the shit on their skins talk about the vomiting and shitting of rainbows.
