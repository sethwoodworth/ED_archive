Metro SWAT officers and counter-terrorism detectives stormed the south-west [[Las Vegas]] Valley home of '''Colby Schoolcraft''' in the middle of the night on Oct. 15 and seized a cache of weapons and ammunition, including an [[AK-47]] assault rifle.

Authorities say they believed acts of violence were about to be committed against the local [[Scientology]]
church. Schoolcraft, 23, is a member of “[[Anonymous]],” an Internet-fueled group that has [[over 9000]] members who organize protests against [[Scientology]] around the world. Members wear [[EFG]] masks when they raid, to minimize church retaliation, they say.

Scientology counsel, [[Kendrick_Moxon|Moxon]], had tipped off police to threats of potential violence against the local church that Schoolcraft allegedly made on an Anonymous Web site. A photo of the Scientology leader with several bullet holes also appeared on the site, police said. 

Anonymous members commonly refer to their peaceful protests as “raids” and often practice shooting before they stage a protest, responds Schoolcraft's attorney, Rasmussen. [http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/nov/10/scientology-foes-arrest-puts-vegas-big-clash/]
