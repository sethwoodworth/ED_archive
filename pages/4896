Little Fatty
[[Image:Littlefatty.jpg|thumb|Yeah, we get the fucking picture.]]
'''Little Fatty''' is a [[Web 1.0]] meme developed [[at least 100 years ago]] by people who [[nobody cares]] about. Basically, it involves an [[azn]] boy from [[China]], who is kinda [[fat|overweight]], who had his face [[shoop]]ed onto tons of stuff. He was actually 19 at the time of the picture and was employed as a [[loser|petrol station attendant]].

Although he suffered [[butthurt]] over the picture and the meme at first, he has now [[hug|embraced it with open arms]], and became an [[Internet celebrity]] in China, but still, [[nobody gives a fuck]]. He has the following to say for himself:

{{quote|Now my feeling has changed. If you always feel [[depression|depressed]], then you feel [[butthurt|uncomfortable]]. Now I can view this event with a [[cooldude|calm mind]], and I feel [[cum|released]].|Little Fatty}}
