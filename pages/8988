A Marketing Slogan used by an ancient closed source software company called MicroEnSlave. The owner of this company went by the name of [[Bill Gates]], a known [[self-diagnosed]] sufferer of [[Asperger's Syndrome]]. It is rumored that [[Bill Gates]] caused the cancellation of [[Star Trek]]: The Next Generation, invented the country of India and an Operating System that no one really seemed to like called Windows. Many other marketing slogans were used by this company, such as, "How Do You Like Getting Raped?", "I Want To Eat Your Soul" and "All of Your Children Belonging to [[DOS]] Now!"
