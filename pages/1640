'''ClueBot''' is [[Wikipedia]]'s most active anti-[[vandal]] [[bot]], and currently reverts [[over 9000]] vandal edits a day on Wikipedia, which makes users like [[Sceptre]] jealous. It is named because of its [[Alan Turing|artificial intelligence]]; this robot can pick up ''clues'' about an editor's behavior, and as such [[Acalamari]] in a [[fursuit]] wants to have sex with ClueBot for being such a good vandalism reverter.

It is one of many bots that have run on Wikipedia, but it is one of the few that is actually still running today. Why? Well, because the other bots were [[epic fail|malfunctioning]]. Remember MartinBot? Yeah, it got shut down indefinitely, [[lawl]]. There is also another anti-vandal bot, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:VoABot_II VoABot II]. It claims to have enough [[intelligence]] to be able to block [[trolls]] and [[POV]]-pushers, but that's not really true. However, it doesn't stop those [[Wikipedo]] admins with a [[robot]] [[fetish]] from getting all hot and bothered and finding that their [[panties]] are in a twist with praise. For example:

{{quote|This Bot along with VoABot II are [[shit nobody cares about|probably the two most useful bots]] that we have here on Wikipedia because they aid in one of the most important tasks here on Wikipedia, and that is keeping the [[encyclopedia]] mainspace free from vandalism. Hats off to Cobi for creating the bot :) !|[[faggot|Mifter]] (talk) 19:33, 16 May 2008 (UTC)}}

The faggot who created ClueBot is called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cobi Cobi]. He created the Wikipedia [[article]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClueNet ClueNet] about his nerdy stuff. Can you hear '[[Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines|conflict of interest]]', anyone? That article also uses [https://ssl.cluenet.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page its shitty wiki] as a source, even though it isn't a [[reliable sources|reliable source]], because Wikipedos will allow articles on non-[[notable]] subjects that don't offend them.

==ClueBot itself==
ClueBot, unless it is set to [[angry dragon|angry mode]], will only revert the same article being edited by the same user once per day. Despite this, it is still much more effective than [[Huggle]] and [[Twink]]le (those [[gay]] names just get to you every time, [[amirite]]?) and as a result it has had [[at least 100]] [[barnstar]]s ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ClueBot_Commons/Awards O RLY?]) and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ClueBot_Commons/Praise statements of praise] lavished on it, with [[groupie]]s lining up to join the queue for a taste of ClueBot's mechanical [[penis]]. There is no need to cover the faggotry in great detail here, but...

{{Quote|UR AWESOME! And I know as i am constantly getting messages from you (i use a network and an account because of the [[idiot]]s at my [[school]]). I see some vandalism and go to edit it, just to find out that it's gone! by you! [[ALL CAPS|U ROCK]]!|[[13-year-old boy|Matthew]] (talk) 18:22, 19 March 2008 (UTC)}}

ClueBot is also at [[war]] with [[Grawp]]. A special heuristic has been designed to catch Grawp-like behaviour, meaning that anything saying "HAGGER?" will be reverted by the bot. One Wikipedo recently had the following thing to say about Grawp's tactics:

{{quote|I have to admit, that's pretty clever. Sad that someone wastes what is probably a [[asspie|gifted mind]] on vandalizing Wikipedia.|Wikipedo user Enigma}}

However, Grawp knows what ClueBot does well, but doesn't care. He will continue to use edit summaries including "[[for great justice]] and [[epic lulz]]" and include a link to [[Last Measure|nimp.org]]. This is because he is doing it for a [[did it for the lulz|noble cause]], and since [[Anonymous]] is legion, it doesn't matter how many of Grawp's [[personal army]] get blocked, because they are [[divide by zero|infinite in number]]. Hell, even [[Alison]] thinks TOW is like a [http://static.wikipedia.org/new/wikipedia/en/articles/w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_an_MMORPG_e11e.html MMORPG] now, and she said that on the [[Wikipedia Review]]. She's in serious danger of losing her [[cock|checkuser tools]]!

==[[Moar]] ClueBot==
[[Image:SecurityBot_pwns_ClueBot.jpg|right|thumb|Let's face it: if they fought, [[MysteryBot]] would totally fucking [[Raep|own]] ClueBot.]]
[[Nobody gives a fuck]], but ClueBot is not an only child. Indeed, it has [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ClueBot_Commons/Bots three robot siblings]. As [[slave]]s to the wiki, they have been each assigned different tasks, and never go out of the same little area, kinda like [[Josef Fritzl]]'s grandchildren.

ClueBot is also not perfect. There is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ClueBot/FalsePositives false positives] page where [[at least 100]] users complain every month about the fact that it has reverted something that is not vandalism. For example:

{{quote|I entered a description of [[nobody cares|James Marjoribanks]] early life in the [[British]] CDonsular Service and included the [[Rape]] of Nanking. This latter is a well-known piece of history when the [[Japan]]ese troops made some [[lulz|horrific atrocoities]] on the [[whores|local population]] including [[awesome|rape]]s of the [[china|Chinese]] [[women]] in Nan[[king]] (or Nanjing). I guess the Bot thought the reference to [[rape]] was [[HAGGER|some obscenity]].|Some bitch who created an article about a borderline non-notable person}}

The only Wikipedos who are better than ClueBot at reverting vandalism are [[DerHexer]] and [[NawlinWiki]], enough said. Oh, and finally, the equivalent of ClueBot on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is [[User:SecurityBot|SecurityBot]]. Unlike ClueBot, [[MysteryBot]] has the license to [[rape]], or rather, to r√¶p. So watch your back.
