According to some [[bullshit|respected]] opinions, {{lj|strwbrri_shrtck}} is a [http://community.livejournal.com/bicuriousgirls/438268.html fake] [[bisexual]] pedophile who looks like a religious nut.  Her "soul is filled with darkness", or so says her LJ heading.  The following conversation occured in {{ljcomm|bicuriousgirls}}:

*{{Lj|yofaceizscrumpy}}: Please stop pretending to be a bisexual.
*{{lj|strwbrri_shrtck}}: I'm not pretending, that's the most offensive thing I've heard in my life.
*{{lj|Yofaceizscrumpy}}: All I'm saying is that your sexuality may be made up.  Why is that offensive, if it's just a suggestion?
*{{lj|strwbrri_shrtck}}: You dont know me so therefore you have no credibility in stating this.
*{{lj|Yofaceizscrumpy}}: I'm using [http://community.livejournal.com/bicuriousgirls/438268.html your post] as a primary source for my observation. Just admit that I've trumped you and this will all be over with.
*{{lj|strwbrri_shrtck}}: <b>You did not "trump" me. Back off. I am a bi curious woman, THAT HAS EXPERIMENTED WITH OTHER WOMEN. MAYBE YOU SHOULD READ MY OTHER POST....asshole</b>

She deleted the offending entry, and made her entire journal [[friends only]].  According to recent news reports from CNN, she was raped by a cow on the way home from work, but this was proven to be a misprint.  Not only does she not know the meaning of work, but the sex was apparently consensual between her and the cow.  Sources are currently conflicting over whether or not the "cow" is just an honor-less fat bastard who was plowing her out in the sticks or if the "cow" was in reference to her.  Some are saying both accounts are true.

She then replaced her several paragraphs long [http://strwbrri-shrtck.livejournal.com/profile bio], which featured photos such as the one you see above, with "You dont need to know jack shit about me."  She then  quit {{ljcomm|bicuriousgirls}}.  ED users then made fun of her for this and for being a slut and a [[Kanye West]] fan.  She responded to this by beating her 9 month old daughter in a fit of rage, and making all the memories [[friends only]]. Later that day, her boyfriend (on the left in the picture above) [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Strwbrri_shrtck&diff=1997025709&oldid=1997025683 cleared the text of this page] and its talk pages like 4 times, on orders from his lulz-cow girlfriend.
