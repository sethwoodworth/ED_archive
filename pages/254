Advice Chink
During one of [[4chan]]'s many pilgrimages to the homeland of [[2chan|2chan.net]], yet another annoying macro popped up to be added to the "Advice" series. During these visits to 2chan, the channers will attempt to get in touch with their [[weeaboo]] roots and bring back pictures from their travels to Weeabooland. On one such journey in August 2008, [[Anon]] stumbled across an image of a squinting [[Azn]] man set against a brightly colored background. Sound familiar?  Well, it didn't take long for [[b|/b/]] to associate the image with an already established [[meme]] and fire up the [[Photoshop|INTERNET PAINT MACHINE]] to make [[moar]] pics. And thus, '''Advice Chink''' <small>(Also known as Advice Asian)</small> was born.
