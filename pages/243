__NOTOC__
[[Image:Advance wars kitchen force by gas13.png|thumb|What to expect when playing Advance Wars.]]
In an attempt to appeal to the strategy gaming fanbase that did not want to [[Pokémon|play with furry creatures that had magic powers]], Nintendo and Intelligent Systems got to work in developing a game that would appeal to this [[serious business|serious gaming market]]. This game is known as '''Advance Wars''', a series of games widely known as [[Nintendo]]'s failed attempt at creating a good turn-based strategy game.

{{clear}}

==Turn-based Strategies Have Never Felt So [[fail|Good]]==
The core of the gameplay is essentially four armies running around trying to defeat each other with various [[gun|weapons of mass destruction]], while a fifth army attempts to conquer the world, at which point the four previously mentioned armies must band together and defeat this fifth army, resulting in [[anarchy|world peace]], where the four armies can go back to killing each other off once again; lather, rinse, repeat. There are also several gameplay modes irrelevant to the main story.<br/>
Despite its content, it is commonly regarded as a [[Yu-Gi-Oh|children's game]], mainly because of its weeaboo animé graphics, its vast array of characters each with [[bipolar|different personalities]], and its [[cock|kid]]-[[ass|friendly]] [[fuck|non]]-[[shit|vulgar]] [[piss|dialogue]]. Also, unlike its more realistic but [[lie|not as popular]] counterpart, [[Fire Emblem]], units lost in battle can easily be re-purchased wherever facilities are available.

===Censorship===
[[Image:Aw os nell Luigi64.jpg|thumb|150px|Nell's original outfit was deemed inappropriate for American audiences.]]
As with anything that reaches this side of the Pacific ocean, this game received a heavy amount of [[4kids|censorship]]. The Red Star army was renamed to "Orange Star" because red stars in a children's video game obviously define some sort of communism and has a dire impact on the great American nation. Drake's outfit was heavily modified to resemble a sailor because a pirate in charge of a navy would not be [[logic]]al to the typical American gamer. [[Christianity|Olaf was edited to not look like Santa Claus]], and Grit's cigarette was also removed. Smoking is bad for you, kids.
*[http://forums.warsworldnews.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=9320 Various changes between Jap and US versions]

===Racism===
Despite the vast array of characters available, there are no black people in this game. There is an [[over 9000|abundance]] of [[white]], some [[asian]], and one [[mexican]], but no black people present in the game at all.

===Hacking===
<video type="youtube" id="UPe75GHHNHc" width="320" height="240" desc="[[how do i shot web|How do you balance game]]? Disable powers!" frame="true" position="right"/>
Oddly enough, the game is highly popular on the hacking scene. Be it minor graphical enhancements, or all out modifications, many [[1337|elite]] hackers often try their hand at changing some aspect of this game.

===How Many Of These Games Are There?===
Like most games that originate from Japan, this series has been needlessly milked with boring, lackluster sequels that follow the same basic formula.

====Advance Wars====
The first game of the series is a complex piece of [[shit]]. In Campaign Mode, you fight off the power-hungry Olaf and his Blue Moon army from invading your (<s>Red</s> Orange Star) territory [[hypocrite|while you march through Kanbei's Yellow Comet territory and invade them]]. At the same time, you ward off Eagle's Green Earth army because he blames you for having attacked his units. You eventually come across a [[cuntpaste|clone]] of Andy ([[duh|where you immediately realize that it was this clone who attacked Eagle]]) and, once dealing with him, Sturm himself. Upon completion of the campaign, you'll find that you have to play it all over again; no one has become unlocked for purchase because you either took too damn long to complete each mission, or you used the wrong CO to complete certain missions.<br/>Another important note, [[wat|you can't even play the Campaign mode until you complete all of the Field Training scenarios anyway]], so this game is [[THE BEST|no real fun]] at all.

====Advance Wars 2: [[Electric Boogaloo|Black Hole Rising]]====
<video type="youtube" id="dSHFnezm_vA" width="320" height="240" desc="It's surprisingly [[unfunny|accurate]]." frame="true" position="right"/>
The second game in the series, this game is slightly more streamlined, and it's much easier to unlock extra COs. It continues the struggle against the evil forces of Sturm, only now he has a [[personal army]] to do his bidding. Unlike the previous game, where you only play as <s>Red</s> Orange Star COs, you play as each CO of each army at least once, giving a more rounded feel of the game. You also face Sturm's henchmen [[at least 100]] times before getting to Sturm himself. [[furry|Hawke]] eventually betrays and kills him, running off with the rest of the misfits.

====Advance Wars: [[List_of_sex_moves#D|Dual Strike]]====
'''''D'''ual '''S'''trike'' continues the epic saga against the Black Hole army, this time on the [[Nintendo DS]] ([[irony|why it is still called "'''''Advance''' Wars''" at this point is widely unknown]]). Under a mysterious new commander, Black Hole seeks to drain the world of its energy solely for the lulz. Similar to the previous game, you fight with the COs of other armies as a group now dubbed the "Allied Nations" ([[amirite|more like "Allies", a la World War 2]]). This game added a new twist of gameplay; seeing as CO powers weren't already horribly broken enough, Intelligent Systems decided to add usage of two COs at once. This inevitably begat Tag Powers, allowing one to use two CO powers in one turn. The game also consists of "skills": rank-based abilities that could be given to COs for even more one-sided gameplay.

Also, the Andy clone is back.

'''Game-Breaking Combinations'''
*'''Drake''' + '''Olaf'''/'''Hawke''': ''4HP damage AND -50% fuel? Sign me up!''
*'''Adder''' + '''Koal''': ''+2 movement. Twice.''
*'''Andy''' + '''Hawke''': ''7HP recovery. Best results if Hawke is used first.''
*'''Sami''' + '''Sensei''': ''[[DICKS EVERYWHERE|OH MY GOD THERE'S INFANTRY EVERYWHERE]]''
*'''Sami''' + '''Eagle''': ''Capture the enemy HQ in 1 turn from your base. 'nuff said.''

====Advance Wars: [[emo|Days of Ruin]]====
Intelligent Systems decided that they would [[delete fucking everything|change the fuck out of]] [[everything]], and give the game a [[immature|mature]] twist. The overview on this game has its own section further down the article.

==Gather the Troops!==
Like any [[typical]] army simulation game, Advance Wars has a vast selection of units you can use to kick your opponent's overpowered ass.

===Land Units===
*'''Infantry:''' Your basic cannon fodder. Expect to be [[Zerg Rush|swarmed]] by these when playing against a noob.
*'''Mechanized Infantry:''' Sandnigger with an RPG ([[LARP|Not the other kind you stupid fuck]]). Too slow to be useful.
*'''Recon:''' Only useful during Fog-of-War gameplay. High-speed fodder otherwise.
*'''Tank:''' Basic tank unit. Bread and butter of your army.
*'''Medium Tank:''' Stronger tank unit. Makes regular tanks have penis envy.
*'''Neotank:''' Black Hole invention. A giant asshole on wheels. [[LOLWUT|Somehow faster than the medium tank, despite the heavier armor.]] The allies are morons who don't share their plans with each other, so each nation has to unlock it by raiding different labs.
*'''Megatank:''' Green Earth invention. 5 barreled monstrosity (Compensating for something?) that rapes everything, if you can get it close enough and keep it supplied. Somehow managed to only put one machine gun on it.  [[Lie|At 28000G it is an excellent investment sir]].
*'''Armoured Personal Carrier (APC):''' Intended to move Infantry/Mech around faster, but most players use them as decoys. Can somehow supply adjacent allied APCs fuel even if none of them have fuel defying the principle of mass-energy conservation principle.
*'''Artillery:''' Generic indirect firing unit. Observe the way it cumshots at enemies.
*'''Rockets:''' Artillery on steroids. Guy standing close by with binoculars can somehow see through mountains or other visually impairing terrain like glass to spot targets.
*'''Anti-Air:''' Shoots planes down directly. Useful for raping infantry.
*'''Missiles:''' Shoots planes down from a distance with a high range of vision. At least it would if the planes didn't outmaneuver it and blow it to hell. Fucking ground fodder.
*'''Piperunner:''' Black Hole invention. Useless as no one plays in levels with pipes anyway unless you are a fucking pot head.

===Naval Units===
*'''Lander:''' Because tanks don't work very well underwater and nothing is amphibious.
*'''Cruiser:''' Basic naval unit. These can also carry two copter units on board, but nobody knows that.
*'''Battleship:''' The only unit in the game with a decent attack range.
*'''Carrier:''' [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/showthread.php?p=9514#post9514 A MOST EDUCATED GENTLEMEN's] [[fursona]].
*'''Submarine:''' Sea [[ninja]].
*'''Black Boat:''' Black Hole invention. Repairs units for [[gold]].

===Air Units===
Cannot fly over pipes but somehow long range ordinance from artillery, rockets, battleships, etc. can fly over them.
*'''Fighter:''' [[JEWS DID WTC|Advance Wars did WTC]]. All pilots are mentally handicapped to only use missiles, preventing them from using a majority of a fighter plane's arsenal including machine guns and bombs.
*'''Bomber:''' Advance Wars also did WW2.
*'''Battle Copter:''' [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/showpost.php?p=4776&postcount=28 Wittmann's] [[fursona]]. Cheap way of harassing ground units for fun, unless they have anti-air capabilities.
*'''Transport Copter:''' Because your Infantry can't fly. Airborne fodder.
*'''Stealth Plane:''' The unholy fusion of a Fighter, Bomber, and Submarine. It can attack air and ground units, AND hide itself in the sky. In other words, YOU GONNA GET RAEPED! Offset by the fact it uses shitloads of fuel when hiding.
*'''Black Bomb:''' Black Hole invention. Blow shit up. An extremist Islamic/Muslim terrorists' pride and joy and answer to airborne infidels. When it gets shot down by a fucking fighter or stealth fighter because of its puny defense [[fail|there goes your well spent 20000G]].

===Black Hole Exclusives===
Among the above units, there are also other field objects that Black Hole may use in battle in an attempt to cheat for victory that also defy science and the Geneva Convention, each of which can be destroyed with varied amounts of [[fire]]power.
Nuclear weapons could have been used.
*'''Minicannon:''' Useless field cannon with pitiful range.
*'''Cannon:''' Useful field cannon with ungodly range.
*'''Factory:''' Massive building that creates units every 2 days with the help of slave labour and stolen property.
*'''Laser:''' Small laser cannon that literally [[Shoop da woop|SHOOP DA WOOPS]] everything in its path.
*'''Death Ray:''' Big fucking [[Shoop da woop|SHOOP DA WOOPER]] of a gun that fires a Big Fucking Laser [[period|every 7 days]]. Actually made obsolete by the cannon's higher frequency of firing despite slightly less damage.
*'''Oozium 238:''' Gelatinous parasitic slimy shit that [[cannibal|eats other units]]. Can somehow devour aircraft.
*'''Black Crystal:''' Heals units 2 spaces away. Encourages Black Hole units to [[Camping|camp]].
*'''Black Obelisk:''' Heals units 4 spaces away. Further encourages Black Hole units to [[Camping|camp]].
*'''Grand Bolt:''' A huge fucking slime creature that breeds Oozium from asexual reproduction by fucking itself.

==Choose Your Alter-Ego==
[[Image:Advance Wars Von Bolt.jpg|thumb|Yeah, this guy looks REAL threatening...]]
[[Image:Majorzero.jpg|thumb|[[Metal Gear Solid|Von Bolt in 3D]]]]

As with [[typical]] strategy games, there are [[at least 100|many]] characters to choose from, each with their own abilities and [[hax|powers]].
===[[Image:Aw red star icon.gif]] [[censorship|<s>Red</s>]] [[communism|Orange Star]]===
*'''<s>Ryo</s> Andy:''' Known as the [[Ryu]] of Advance Wars; [[everyone]] uses him. Possesses no real abilities but [[pussy|is able to heal his units]].
*'''Max:''' Your average muskleman.
*'''<s>Domino</s> Sami:''' ZERG RUSH KEKEKEKEKEKEKEKEKE
*'''<s>Catherine</s> Nell:''' The most difficult playable character to obtain, as this usually involves beating Advance/Hard/Nightmare Mode Campaign with the [[high score|highest rank possible]]. All her units are able to do is higher damage at random; supposedly known as "[[fuck|luck]]". Actually gets into massive orgies with her soldiers to "up" their mood and therefore firepower.
*'''<s>Eight</s> Hachi:''' Makes tourneyfags shit bricks.
*'''<s>John</s> Jake:''' Typical [[wigger]] is a [[pretty cool guy]]. He wears massive headphones and doesn't afraid of anything.
*'''Rachel:''' Nell's [[incest|sister]]. Special powers include bombing opponents' units at random.

===[[Image:Aw blue moon icon.gif]] [[I just wanted to make it snow|Blue Moon]]===
A communist jew nation. Responsible for supplying Liquid Snake with the Hind D in Metal Gear Solid.
*'''<s>Whip</s> Olaf:''' Santa Claus, with less presents and more snow.
*'''<s>Billy</s> Grit:''' Redneck with [[headshot|BOOM, HEADSHOT!!!]]
*'''<s>Ewan</s> Jew:''' Has not much power attack but he is awesome because when he get get full at super power co he will get extreme manny moneys damn this guy is a <s>pimp</s> jew.
*'''Jew:''' Caused the stockmarket crash in 2008.

===[[Image:Aw yellow comet icon.gif]] [[japan|Yellow Comet]]===
Ancient weaboo army of Japan.
*'''<s>Kikutiyo</s> Kanbei:''' [[SysOp|Emperor]] of Yellow Comet. Strongest units EVER. Sucks off and caters to the obsequious, glorious, parasitic nation of Yellow Comet in the name of honour.
*'''<s>Asuka</s> Sonja:''' She can see into yor soul. Stereotype of nerdy asian girl who gets hit on at school for the wrong reasons.
*'''<s>Yamamoto</s> Sensei:''' Same Zerg Rush; less KEKEKEKE. All he could do was "sunbathe" all day but was actually financially deprived as proven by Adder and went out of retirement to earn more money and shed more blood. Zerg Rushes infantry for fodder so less people would occupy valuable spaces on the beaches after the war ends.
*'''<s>Kouzou</s> Grimm:''' Kanbei on steroids. Holds entire colonies of tapeworms in that obese abdomen of his from all that sushi and sashimi he cannot help scoffing down all the time.

===[[Image:Aw green earth icon.gif]] [[Nazi|Green Earth]]===
*'''Eagle:''' Resident otherkin who has the [[magic]]al ability to move twice in one turn.
*'''<s>Mop</s> Drake:''' [[pun|Sea man]]. Summons a tsunami to wipe out half the fuel and rations of enemy forces to his direction to satisfy his petrol-sniffing urges and sustain his obesity.
*'''<s>Hannah</s> Jess:''' Spends too much time out of the [[kitchen]]. Tries to assert femininity by drivin' tanks.
*'''<s>Bittman</s> Javier:''' [[Verbose thread]]. The not-so-egotistical version of Chris Jericho. Makes sure an Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus is with him at all times.

===[[Image:Aw black hole icon.gif]] [[goatse|Black Hole]]===
[[Image:Kindle.jpg|thumb|Sure, she doesn't look dangerous...]]
*'''<s>Kong</s> Flak:''' Unlike Andy, Max's clone wasn't very successful. Has the intelligence of a caveman.
*'''<s>Cat</s> Lash:''' [[Closet Furry]]. To compensate for her immense intelligence and skipping school for university as an [[God|engineer]], her maturity remains at the level equivalent to a 4 year old child.
*'''<s>Snake</s> Adder:''' [[Some argue]] that he [[The Great Black Dick Hoax|compensates]] for his immensely small power bar. Was renamed to Adder so not to be confused with that [[Metal Gear Solid|hero we all know and love who is obviously more manly than Adder]]. [[Michael Jackson|Look at his fucking pasty face]]; he obviously applied too much of that face powder he stole from Lash. He also wares high-heels, that [[faggot]].
*'''Hawke:''' No, he's [[Mexican]], not black. Big difference. Lie. Cheat. Steal.
*'''<s>Chakka</s> Jugger:''' [[Sockpuppet]] of Flak with larger [[penis|power bar]]. Every second line from him is a reference to [[Windows]].
*'''<s>Zipo</s> Koal:''' [[Sockpuppet]] of Adder [[shit nobody cares about|that fights better on roads and spouts out random proverbs from that decorated porcelain cranium of his]].
*'''<s>Candle</s> Kindle:''' Claims to be a better inventor than Lash. Obsessed with her [[ugly|beauty]] and has a fetish for [[penis|buildings]]. Makes [[the best]] come backs and is the most [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|well-educated, arrogant and literate]] Black Hole CO of [[Kanye West|all time, of all time!]].
*'''Sturm:''' Final boss of AW1 and AW2. A CO made of [[hack]]s and is a favourite of noobs as his units are ridiculously overpowered, possess the defense of an angry God and can traverse harsh terrain as if nothing is there. Somewhat akin to the P90 of [[Call of Duty 4]]. Causes meteors to rain from the sky and pretty much destroy everything in their path.
*'''<s>Hell-Volt</s> Von-Bolt:''' Final boss of AW:DS. An [[old|old fart]] that controls the flow of electricity. Disables vehicles and somehow infantry by shutting down their nervous system, yet affected units are somehow not brain-dead and still live to counter-attack while immobile. [http://images.wikia.com/metalgear/images/2/2c/Zeromgs4.jpg 3D version of Von-Bolt]

==Advance Wars: Days of Ruin==
{{spoilers|CAULDER IS A [[Time Paradox|CLONE OF HIMSELF WHO KILLED HIS ORIGINAL SELF]]}}

[[TL;DR|Supposedly a "re-invention" of Advance Wars, ''Days of Ruin'' takes a darker spin on the traditional Advance Wars plot. Set in a post-apocolyptic era, a meteor strike (sound familiar?) has left the world in a]] [[anarchy|chaotic]] [[TL;DR|state; toxic clouds cover the sky with darkness,]] [[food]] [[TL;DR|supplies dwindle, and sickness plagues the land. Everyone is pretty much dead, with the exception of the few survivors who will stop at absolutely nothing to survive. A small group of warriors fight to restore world peace amidst chaos, corruption, and turmoil. As would be expected with such a storyline, the entire happy-go-lucky cast of previous generations, as well as their respective armies, have been replaced with new characters, and two generic stereotypical warring countries -- one of the countries is split into two factions. The game is also full of plot-twists and spoilers, such as]] [[shit nobody cares about|the 12th Battalion joining forces with the Lazurian Army to go against the New Rubinelle Army halfway through the storyline]].

There's also a black guy for once. [[nice try|It's still racist though, because you can't play as him]].

===Who Are The New Guys?===
[[Image:AW DoR Caulder.jpg|thumb|Badass? Psycho-masochistic fucknut? You decide.]]
New faces and factions appear in this post-apocalyptic war game, most of which can easily [[copypasta|relate to their predecessor characters]]. [[LOL|Several of them die]], and [[fail|several are either unplayable, or you don't play as them at all]].

====[[Image:Aw 12th battalion icon.png]] [[Americunts|12th <s>Independent Legion</s> Battalion]]====
*'''<s>Ed</s> Will:''' Average stereotypical "only survivor who joins the good guys" type guy.
*'''<s>Brown</s> Brenner:''' [[Troll's Remorse]]. Gets killed by a WTFBomb.
*'''<s>Rin</s> Lin:''' Advance Wars is Serious Business.
*'''<s>Cattleya</s> Isabella:''' Some girl that Will [[rape|rescues]] early on. Knows too fucking much, and you don't even get to play as her in Campaign.

====[[Image:Aw lazurian icon.png]] [[Zeriara|<s>Zephyrian</s> Lazurian Army]]====
*'''<s>Atory</s> Tasha:''' [[That's not funny, my brother died that way]].
*'''<s>Trak</s> Gage:''' Carries around a sniper rifle he doesn't use.
*'''<s>Caryle</s> Forsythe:''' Has no CO power, but a massive [[penis|command zone]] instead, whatever the fuck that means.

====[[Image:Aw new rubinelle icon.png]] [[Laura Talbot|New <s>Laurentia</s> Rubinelle Army]]====
*'''<s>Cole</s> Davis:''' Don't bother. He's unplayable.
*'''<s>Dieter</s> Waylon:''' [[Concerned Mother|HOLY SHIT HE SAYS "CRAP" IN AN E10+ GAME]].
*'''<s>Sigismundo</s> Greyfield:''' The cake is a [[lie]].

====[[Image:Aw intelligent defense system icon.png]] [[Defense|Intelligent Defense System]]====
*'''<s></s> Cyrus:''' [[wat|Clone of Caulder]]. He isn't even a CO (thus unplayable), and shouldn't be in this list in the first place.
*'''<s>Roumi</s> Penny:''' Loli? In my strategy games?
*'''<s>Lisabeth</s> Tabitha:''' You'd probably hit this.
*'''<s>Beris</s> Caulder:''' Final boss of DoR. Commonly seen as the result of running Sturm through the [[Internet Hate Machine]]. Not only is he [[fail|banned from online gameplay]], but players are known [[tourneyfag|to mutually agree not to play as him in multiplayer battles]], simply because he is [[god|that powerful]]. Despite his [[over 9000|power level]], he dies in the end.

====[[Image:Aw raiders icon.png]] [[shit nobody cares about|Miscellaneous]]====
*'''<s>Drakov</s> The Beast:''' Unplayable CO of the Raiders. Caulder kills him for the lulz.
*'''Fanatic:''' [[Christfag]] who worships an earthworm.

===New Units!===
Despite everything else in the game being changed to some degree, the units in this game [[lazy|remain largely unchanged from their predecessors]]. Apart from some units being removed and/or otherwise tweaked in some fashion, new units have been added.
====Land Units====
*'''Motorbike:''' Basic land unit on [[Bike|wheels]]. Though impeded by terrain, there is still a possibility of being [[Zerg Rush|swarmed]] by them.
*'''Flare:''' Fog of War battles can be fun again.
*'''Anti-Tank:''' [[wat|Indirect-firing unit with direct-firing range]].
*'''Rig:''' So the APC got renamed. Big fucking deal.

====Naval Units====
*'''Gunboat:''' Replaced the Black Boat. Ammunition: [[1]] Sea-Borne cannon fodder.

====Air Units====
*'''Duster:''' Stealth plane at [[only 2 percent]] of its power level.
*'''Seaplane:''' Extremely useful unit hampered only by its [[tinychan|tiny]] fuel tank.

==Trolling Advance Wars Veterans==
Despite how [[popular]] this game is, there are not very many methods available to troll its fanbase. An overused method would be to simply make speculation that Sturm is playable in either ''Dual Strike'' or ''Days of Ruin''; hackers will flock to present [[hax|coded evidence]] that this is not possible, and general fans will be sure to rage.

==Quotes==
{{quote|Everything in this game is basically a variation of gray. Seriously, the background during battle animations is all gray: Gray concrete, gray buildings, gray grass, gray everything! Also, the landscapes are even more depressing, since they're all basically gray, dark brown, or some color portraying depression. Very unlifting.|Days of Ruin remains highly accepted among long-time players of the series.}}

{{quote|1=Everyone knows that this is why they ARE GONNA BUY the game. It’s original, fun and crazy. You wanna keep playing forever. There are so many maps in this game that you won’t know which to choose. You can also design maps which kicks ass. I love the maps in this game; they are a bit better than the old maps. Also, if I'm not mistaken, some maps from the original return in this game too. There are also many CO's in this game, I wont tell you who so I don't ruin it for you. From war-room to campaign, everything is great!|2=[[fanboy|HOLY FUCKING SHIT THIS GAME IS THE BEST EVER]]}}

{{quote|Flak is a mere rehash of Max's character, only he's even more of an idiot, and Hawke's style is frustrating to play against, upsetting the otherwise balanced character designs.|Tourneyfag senses tingling...}}

{{quote|1=Advance Wars is a game in which boredom and brain power collide in a vicious confrontation within your mind, which then makes you ponder the rather entertaining idea of taking Advance Wars back to the store you just bought it from to get your money back.|2=[http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/review/R44347.html Truth.]}}
