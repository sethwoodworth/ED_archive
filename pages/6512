According to the [[shit nobody cares about|story]], an unheard-of new arcade [[the Game|game]] appeared in [[Over 9000|several]] suburbs of Portland, Oregon in 1987, something of a [[nevar|rarity]] at the time. The game, [[no|Polybius]], proved to be incredibly [[gay|popular]], to the point of [[Drugs|addiction]], and lines formed around the [[dicks|machines]], quickly followed by clusters of visits from [[niggers|men in black]]. Rather than the usual [[Semen|marketing data]] collected by [[Furries|company visitors]] to arcade machines, they collected some [[Nothing|unknown data]], [[What|allegedly testing responses to the psychoactive machines]]. The players themselves suffered from a series of [[AIDS|unpleasant side-effects]], including [[Butthurt|amnesia, insomnia, nightmares, night terrors]], and even [[An hero|suicide]] in some versions of the [[Shit|legend]]. Some players stopped playing video games, while it is reported that one became an [[Moralfag|anti-gaming activist]]. The supposed creator of Polybius is [[Faggot|Ed Rotberg]], and the company named in the [[Fake|urban legend]] is Sinneslöschen (German for [[Buttsecks|"sense-deletion"]]), often named as either a secret [[Troll|government]] organization or a [[Lulz|codename for Atari]]. The [[Secks|gameplay]] is said to be similar to [[Rape|Tempest]] (a [[Fuck|shoot]] 'em up game utilizing [[Future|vector graphics]]), while the game is said to contain [[Tits|subliminal messages]] which would influence the action of [[You|anyone playing it]].

The origin of the [[Stupid|legend]] is unknown. Some [[Trolls|internet commentators]] think it originated as a [[Truth|usenet hoax]]. Other [[Pedophiles|bloggers]] believe the story is a [[Fake|true]] [[Shit|urban legend]] – one that grew out of [[Lies|exaggerated and distorted tales]] of an early release version of Tempest that caused problems with [[Retards|photosensitive epilepsy]]; the game was reported to have caused [[Erectile dysfunction|motion sickness]] and [[Diabeetus|vertigo]], and was therefore [[Raped|pulled]].
