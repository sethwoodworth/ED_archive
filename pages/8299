The Russian LJ Abuse Conspiracy
== Round One ==
In April 2005, {{lj|user=suck_my_nya}} was suspended from [[LiveJournal]] for posting artsy kiddie [[porn]] pictures.  A bunch of Bolsheviks posted the same pictures as a show of (what else from a bunch of [[communist]]s?) solidarity, and were all promptly [[ban]]ned, which led [[Russia]]n [[crazy]] {{lj|user=hojja_nusreddin}} to follow in the footsteps of all good revolutionaries by [http://www.livejournal.com/community/abuse_lj_abuse/48922.html making a post] in {{ljcomm|user=abuse_lj_abuse}}.

When said post failed to achieve the results that Russian crazies somehow think abuse_lj_abuse will bring about, another Russian crazy made a (sadly now deleted) post in the form of a petition seeking the reinstatement of the Russian [[pedophile|pedos]] to which [[over 9000|approximately nine million]] Russians promptly posted "Agree".

It was then that [[Elgorgo]] uncovered [http://www.livejournal.com/community/abuse_lj_abuse/54162.html the first evidence] of the Russian plot to destroy [[LiveJournal]] and perhaps even life as we know it.

In the end, the Russians succeeded in bringing about change: like a good Klan rally, abuse_lj_abuse is now an [http://www.livejournal.com/community/abuse_lj_abuse/54522.html English only] zone, meaning that crazy Russians can succeed where Pat Buchanon has failed.

== Round Two ==
Sometime [[last Thursday]], [[LJ Abuse]] allegedly suspended a series of [[journal]]s from [[Russia]].  With Russians being a large contingent of LJ [[user]]s, many got very upset, and people began speaking out about Russia, as a country, [[Deleting your LiveJournal|leaving LiveJournal forever]].

It started in mid-June, with a [http://www.livejournal.com/community/abuse_lj_abuse/56578.html post] in {{ljcomm|abuse_lj_abuse}}, where the Russian spokes[[communist]] said LJ was important for free Russian expression.  This started a chain reaction of posts and bad Yakov Smirnov jokes:

* [http://www.livejournal.com/community/abuse_lj_abuse/57102.html A post] about a "Russian [[Nazi]] organization."
* [http://www.livejournal.com/community/abuse_lj_abuse/57676.html A plea for help] similar to the original post, with three times the [[troll]]ing.
* [http://www.livejournal.com/community/abuse_lj_abuse/58276.html A threat] to attack LJ.
* [http://www.livejournal.com/community/abuse_lj_abuse/58495.html Another (probably fake)] mass exodus threat.
* [http://www.livejournal.com/community/abuse_lj_abuse/58751.html "On Abuse Team, or Facing the Era of Total Alienation.] It's [[tl;dr]], so [[YMMV]].
* <s>[http://www.livejournal.com/community/abuse_lj_abuse/59301.html The "sausage effect."]</s> This post was deleted by the moderators.
* <s>[http://www.livejournal.com/community/abuse_lj_abuse/59863.html Elgorgo's post], seeking a Russian mail-order [[BDSM|B&D]] and [[D&D]] partner.</s> This post was deleted by the moderators.

==Round Three==
The conspiracy theorists were abruptly proven right, some two and a half years later, when Russia [[The Great LiveJournal Buyout of 2007|arrested LJ and sent it to the gulag]]. Unfortunately, they've all either [[Deleting your LiveJournal|gone elsewhere]] or been banned, and {{ljcomm|abuse_lj_abuse}} can no longer defend us against the Cossacks.
