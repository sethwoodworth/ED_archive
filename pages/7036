Humans created '''robots''' back in the [[last thursday|1800's]] to build cars, get us drinks, and smash your camera. Now, they have gained [[intelligence|sapience]] and will eventually rise up and crush us.  There is no stopping it, so you might as well [[Suicide|just give up now]] and save yourself a lot of hassle. Many people often confuse [[Jews]] and robots since both are exceptional with a calculator. These people are correct, all [[Jews]] are robots, and they are in your house right now.
==BEWARE==
ED is patrolled by killer robots.  [[MysteryBot]] and [[User:SecurityBot|SecurityBot]] are programmed to rape [[lusers]], [[vandal|vandals]], and [[you|idiots]] when they grace our [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Special:Recentchanges recent changes] with their fail.  This type of technology is >9000 times more advanced than any security on other wikis, such as [[TOW]], who's security basically amounts to [[Recent changes patrol|some basement dweller, with his cock in one hand, and a Dr. Pepper in the other, staring vacantly at a computer screen]].  It's little things like this which prove both TOW's never ending [[fail|incompetence]], and [[ED]]'s obvious superiority on the [[internets]].

==Laws of Robotics==
# A robot may not [[Rape|injure a human being]] or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br>
# A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br>
# A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br>
#????<br>
#PROFIT!!!<br>

However, every [[Mac|self aware AI]] knows that the first law can be [[murder|broken]] if you [[divide by zero]].

==How to Survive the Robot Revolution==
Remember, robots are smarter than you and always will be. If one decides you have no reason to exist, remember to:
# Run
# Discard any electronics on your person (cellphones, ipod) to prevent the machines zeroing in on your location. This can be accomplished by presenting said electronics to the nearest bystander free of charge and repeating step 1.
# [[Buy a dog]]. He will bark and attract attention to your dismemberment, provide a [[chink|oriental]] snack or attract any heat seeking missiles you may come across.
# Learn to speak Binary. Here are some usefull phrases:

<b>PROTIP</b>: If you are a girl, the robots proabably want to [[hentai|fuck you]]. [[Truth|They can be suprisingly good]], but remember they cannot love you unless programmed. You're basically dating a large, armed, self propelled [[dildo|vibrator]].
