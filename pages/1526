<br/>Subject: A thought for you, Megan

Considering my family, and "I'm livin' under their roof", you may want to consider typing up all that you told me last night to back you up in the face of my family.  And you may want to set some additional funds aside for rent.  Also, offering to help with the chores is good.
 
I am unanimous with myself in welcoming you to our house as our guest for as long as you need, and I truly meant every word I said.  It's my mother's and father's opinion you may have for another obsticle.
 
I hope my family will be willing to help you, a descendant German Warrior Traveler.  :)
 
Take care;
Chris Chan.

So, here it is.  Please share it with Megan and the Jessicas and the others.
 

For My True Love, I Would…
A message from what’s left of my heart and soul,
by Christian Weston Chandler, December 30, 2007
 
For my true love, I'd treat her tenderly, sweetly, gently...like a summer breeze.  I'd caress her skin gently with my strong fingers.  I'd take her to eat and provide for her to my ability.  I'd start small at McDonalds, then let it get better in due time.  When the mood is right, I'd wisk her in my arms, and lift her up in sweet gentleness.  I would share with her the BEST kiss of my life, and hopefully hers, since it would be the first of my life.  I would do for her as much as I am able to in getting her the  she desires.  Every day, I would try to make her smile with a jest, a spark, or a tender massage.  If she is willing to allow the pleasure, I’d lay her down caress her gently tickle her fancy; have her tickle my fancy, and give it to her with the learned lonely experience I’ve endured.  But I digress on that.  Most importantly, I would hang on to her every word of her life tales, er feelings, her troubled times, and I’d share my condolences accordingly.  And I can hope she would be willing to do the same for me.  I am nothing without this woman, so I hope and pray that she will stay to love me for me, as I would stay with her for her.  “I LOVE YOU” would be shared daily with a French side dish.  J  I am her soldier, to do for her as she sees fit.

<br/>Subject: Hey, Megan.

Just a reminder; please reply if otherwise, but please don't forget my Memory Stick Duo, as well as yours and John's Pokemon Diamond/Pearl games and DS Systems for when I meet you all at The End tomorrow.
 
I will be sure to come with my Wii and Pokemon Battle Revolution and my Action Replay DS accessory.
 
I will check my e-mail tomorrow in the afternoon for your reply.
 
Take care, and see you all tomorrow.

<br/>Subject: Thank you, Anna

But I'm certain that it's just some dude with nothing better to do with his time.  He'll probably get tired of doing anything after a week or two, if I do not respond harshly or post anything new.  I told my mother she can do whatever she wanted on that, just be careful.  My only concern about that is finding out who took that photo pic last Friday and why.  Other than that, I'm recovering with the intent of just moving on with my life.
 
Okay, now for the good news.  Have you ever met Joshua Martinez?  He's an ol' buddy of mine; we went to JMU during our childhood for Special Education classes.  He carpooled with me and my father in his car.  While in Harrisonburg, we would have lunch at Country Cookin', and have fun at the park (can't remember the name) that used to have an empty airplane.  He is a mix of American and Spanish.
 

Also, Joshua has cousins who are a band in Hollywood, so Josh has met stars such as Britney Spears, Jessica Alba (Josh told me about Jessie being a mix of American and Spanish), and others.  Like I said, Joshua is popular; he's got the looks and the height (about 6'2").
 
After running to him at McDonalds at Forest Lakes a few weeks ago, he's kept in touch with me more than I would have after that day, and we've caught up in more or less the current events in our lives.  He has become VERY Popular with the ladies, I tell you what.  :D  He's also hooked a few of his male acquaintances with a good gal each.  I am no different.
 
Also, recently, Joshua received an extra Nintendo Wii console from a friend, so he sold it to me for a solid $240 (I saved about 22.49 in comparison to buying at a store after tax).
 
Megan broke up my emotions for her after the PaRappa contest, but we're still ONLY Friends.  After that e-mail, I've moved on, back to the coal mines (so to speak).  Granted that I have had absolutely no luck in having ANY women come to me while I hung out at the Alderman Library up to now.  Joshua found a gal who WAS interested in me, after reading about me in my MySpace profile at least.
 
Her name is Lori Lopez.  I chatted with her through AOL Instant Message last night... &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3  She was really sweet, and not only did I have a great time getting to know her, but... *blush* I got turned on.  I know that she works (at a car lot, I think), she is 23, brunette, brown eyes, and she is a mix of American and Spanish.  If you've watched the movie, "Into The Blue," the starring woman, Jessica Alba is an American/Spanish mix as well.
=C

I'm keeping the Sweetheart Search details on my profile until I know for certain that Lori is really to be my Sweetheart.  :)
 
I gtg; my cell phone number is still the same, so feel free to call me.
 
Take care;
Chris Chan.

<br/>Subject: Just to let you know...

Hey, Megan.  It became kind of a ghost-town at the Game Place last Friday; most of the children left.  It's too bad you didn't make it.  Anyway, I wanted to let you know that I got a Piplup and Turtwig through SUCCESSFUL Trades through the GTS (Wi-Fi).  Also, have you or John gone underground with the Explorers' Kit?  I found 4 Skull Fossils, so I have 3 extra Craniados; if I don't get one through the GTS by the Friday after Thanksgiving (NO LEAGUE this coming Friday), I need the other fossil Pokemon of the Diamond/Pearl Generation (the one that evolves into Bastiedon).  I will trade you or John a Craniados for that Fossil Pokemon.  One more thing, please Show me a Palkia in my Diamond game, so I can try to get one through the GTS.
 
That's about it for now.  Please reply ASAP.
 
Take care;
Chris Chan.
 
P.S.
This is Lori; the girl my buddy Joshua is hooking me up with.  She had it done at JMU; that's why it has her name on it.

<br/>Subject: Hello, Kat, I am Christian Chandler

You may or may not know me (depending on how often you're on the internet, and if you've found me by reference or search), but I have something to tell you about your "cuddle-butt", Jason.  He has been playing a Major Cog in the Slander Factory known as Encyclopedia Dramatica, and among all the innocent victims that the website has vandalized beyond the worst embarrassment known to mankind within their grasp, your bully of a boyfriend is the Original Author of the "Chris-chan" page that was put up there for the "LULZ", "Laughs Under Lucricities".  Which I don't have to tell you is not only mean and cruel, the page is HORRIBLE.



Against me, that page has broken the closest thing I've had to a relationship with Megan Schroeder, who I've finally had at her first time of saying with feeling, "I Love You" to me, then she found that page and she broke up with me.  It broke my heart.



Also, the chaos from the page broke up the buddy friendship between me and my buddy, Joshua Martinez, who attended Special Ed classes with me during our childhood.



And after the first time I found that page myself, I went into a spiral of rage against that machine, that with the break-ups and chaos, I became depre
ssed and went into a forced-by-personal-emotions hiatus.



There are numerous other chaotic happenings that raged from the ED page, but I can't remember them all.



Anyway, the point is, if it wasn't for your "Bully Next Door", I would not have to have had to endure the stress, emotional pains, break-ups, self-torments, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera!!!



Who knows what he may have in mind against you in relation.  While he may have started with me, or possibly any one or more of the victims on Encyclopedia Dramatica, who knows when he will do something similarly evil or worse against you.



Oh, BTW, in other states, it IS illegal for his 20-year old self to be Dating 17-year old you.



My apologies for informing you and possibly causing emotional stress and rage, but I felt it was my duty to inform you before it was too late.



Peace,

Christian Weston Chandler.

<br/>Subject: Megan, I've had so much to worry about today

The Good News though is that I've had more fans for Sonichu than I thought.  Now the worse to bad...
 
I got this E-Mail earlier that had a set of four fanart of Sonichu and ME.  While I enjoyed more the spoof of me sitting at by a box on a sidewalk, "Girlfriend Auditions," and the one with me glaring in the eyes of a blue hedgehog in armor.  The OTHER TWO in that set of four... FREAKED, CREEPED AND SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF MY HEAD!!!!!  (A lot worse than my freak-out over you on Christopher's lap last night; please keep that in private, in other words, "Get A Room.")  I sent him a reply with respective criticism.  I WAS INFURIATED!!!
 
Then later, I learn from an anonymous tipster about this girl'ss profile page on deviantART, while she has good and fun fanart of Sonichu, SHE IS TAKING THE CREDIT, AND PLACING A FAKE COPYRIGHT, 2007 WITH HER NAME ON IT!!!  You, Me, and the rest of the Sonichu Fan Club know that Sonichu Was Born On MARCH, 17, 2000 (Y2K).  I sent her a message requesting her to remover her claim of copyright with a warning of Legal Actions.
 
All the images are attached to this e-mail, or I can show them to you on my PSP later.

A 
I just needed to get that off my head and heart, since my mom fell asleep on me at the moment.
 
Okay, I'll see you hopefully at the UFS Tournament.  Also, don't forget to set your clocks one hour back this weekend.
 
Take care;
Chris Chan.

<br/>Subject: I'm sorry... *sigh*

The hugging was one thing, but when I heard the smack of your kiss on his cheek, it started a chain reaction in my head from "OMG" to simultanious infuration and jealousy.  I assure you that I would not do anything extreme to Christopher. 
 
Originally, I was not fond of him, because it was obvious that he was a homo.  Yes, I am a homophobe; I fear them all, and I fear the tormenting temptations of falling off the straight path.  But then I mentally, sometimes from a DVD (and if you'll pardon the expression), shove some pussy in my face.  I tell you what, if I ever stoop down to changing my path, I might as well would get a gender change operation.  I've seen the episode of "South Park" where Mr. Garrison had that operation; they showed the gruesome details.  ugh...
 
I was programmed to be more favorable towards women over those of my gender.  With the infinitely high Boyfriend-Factor, I am not fond of about 99.999999999996% of the total male population, with a margin-of-error of the 4 billionth of a percent (for about 100 men) of whom are okay acquaintences.  Those doofs get all the luck, having a Sweetheart to care for and to be cared from, getting all the hugs, kisses and e
motional support and the security of a solid future without lonliness and with love and children.  And besides that, my Autism is not much help on the programming of my mind.  *sigh*
 
Oh, my life.
 
I have been trying to move on, but I still have caring feelings for you, Megan, since I still have not found another Boyfriend-Free woman to transfer the care to.  I sit at the UVA's Alderman library for Three Hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with a printed advertisement taped on the bar-type furniture across from me, and I am waiting, hoping and praying to be found/picked up by a Boyfriend-Free, 18-25-year old, caring, smoke-free, non-alcholic, white woman, who will voluntarily be my Gal-Pal to Girlfriend to Sweetheart.  Can you understand the loneliness I feel from days and days of not even being approached by a caring someone while I wait and wait and wait to be found by a caring someone?  Not only is it Very Lonesome, but it is Tiresome, Troubling and Frustrating...  *sigh*  It's been that way since the beginning of my Sweetheart Search in August, 2003.  Granted the relieving heart poundings I felt for you for over a year, until the e-mail I received during the Parappa contest last August.
 
But rest-assured, aside from the past issues and angst against the males of the Boyfriend-Factor, I, Christian Christopher Weston Chandler, have not and will not ever have20any intention of killing or murdering or physically ensue pain towards any person, including your Christopher.
 
I am sorry about Friday night, Megan.
 
Take care;
Christian Christopher Weston Chandler.

<br/>Subject: what's up?

Christian I can probably understand how you're feeling. You
looked pretty pissed.....not to mention giving my friend the
"fucky finger".

Why? Why do you hate him so much? Cause now he's really
scared that you're going to go after him and kill him!

Besides if you have to hate someone, it should be me because
I'M the one who didn't return your feelings and didn't want
a serious relationship. Remember I have the right to decide
who I want to be with. Now I'm not saying that I hate you.
You are still my friend....that is if you're going to stop
keep getting grudges and tormenting my friend. You're hatred
and jealousy towards him is affecting me as well. How do I
know you're not going to do something rash? So please just
leave us alone.

I'd like for you to just accept this and move on. You have
no right to hate him, he did nothing bad to you! Personally
I thought you'd actually be happy for me. So please listen
to me and please don't do anything bad and just leave Chris
alone.

Please get back to me
~Megan

<br/>Subject: Hey...How you doing?

It's been a while, and I haven't heard anything from you.  So I thought I would check in.
 
I can only imagine what your may be feeling from the recent trauma.  I truly care and worry about you.  I wanted you to know that I blurted out my confession, because my heart was hit so bad, that it sprung a leak... it leaked pain, torment and the deep feelings I had held in for so long.  *sigh*
 
I can't apologize enough for hurting you the way I did with my jealously over the rule-violating winner, for my lonely, wandering hands wanting to feel your gentle, and spunky, soul, for figiting over such trivial gestures that some others were permitted to share with you, whereas you wouldn't permit me to for your reasons...  Not knowing your current feelings, not knowing what else is going on in your world, not knowing if you and I are still the closest friends to have been for almost two whole years... is all a great weight on my still-recovering heart and my tearful soul...  It's hard for me to enjoy things as I did while I knew you and I were sweet friends, and as I felt there could have been a strong foundation for my one bright future in this cursed Autistic life.  But since I read that message last week and not having heard anything new from you, my faith for that future felt sooo lost; my faith in our friendship wained thin.
 
I CAN'T LOSE YOU, Megan Schroeder, you are the foundation of my happiness after the depression from my LONG, ENDURING Love Quest, you are the inspiration for me to carry on as I was able to for the past greater than a year and so on, you were the reason that I was able to shed fewest tears for that time.
 
Please, please, please, forgive me, let me know that you and I are still the closest friends, and don't deprive you and me of our fun by boycotting the Friday trips to the Game Place.
 
Truly, I just would fall into an infinite sink-hole of depression if I lost you from my life, and it would be an unbearable tragedy...  *sigh*
 
Please reply as soon as possible.

<div style="border:1px dotted #4682B4;padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF">
I didn't get a chance to tell you, but it was truly good to see that you all got back safe from Kentucky...I truly did miss you.  Also it is a weight off my shoulders to hear from you that we are still good friends.
 
Anyhoo, how did John do in his Mechanics class; what was his grade and such?  How was your stay in Kentucky?  And have you been practicing your Guitar skills on your PS2?  *I hope you got better.  :)
 
Also, a few weeks ago, I learned about the Folklore Create-A-Creature contest on the Playstation website; make up a unique creature suitable for the Fantasy world of the upcoming PS3 game, write up the details of the character and send in the .jpg file.  Five will be chosen, among whom will win a copy of the PS3 game and a matching artwork book, and Only One will be programmed into a upcoming Downloable-from-the-Playstation-Store Add-On where the creature will be catchable and playable in the game.  Simply put, I sent in Patti-Chan (see image below).  Speaking of Patti, cute-like story, it was June 27, 2007, the date of the first year anniversary since her accent to heaven.  On that date, neither of us realizing the anniversary yet, but my mother talked about going to the local SPCA building and adopting a new dog.  That night, I realized it upon a Random Remembering, and I cried for a while, so did my mother after I had informed her.  But we did realize that we talked about adopting a new dog on the date of the first anniversary.  Bless her soul.
 
Well, like I said, I will be returing to the UVA's Alderman Library twice a week starting Sept. 4 to resume my Sweetheart Search (AKA Love Quest).  *sigh*  It will be lonely, torturing and enduring like it has been in the past, but I have my dream of a lil' Crystal Weston Chandler.  And the movies and games on my PSP will give me something else to think about as I go back to wishin', hopin', and prayin' to be found by an "18-25-Year Old, caring, sweet, smoke-free, non-alcoholic, white girl" (hopefully a virgin) "to make into a Sweetheart from the Ground-Up".  And at the end of each lonely wait, I will quote my old joke of a commercial, "Call Right Now, and we'll send you a Beautiful Girlfriend FREE".  Then I will pretend to call RIGHT NOW, and always get BUPKIS.  *sigh*  Whatever.
 
One more thing, while I'm thinking about it, are you finished with the Pok'emon Ranger DS game yet, because I still remember our deal?
 
Well, take care you all; I'll see you all again next Friday.
 
Your Friend;
Chris Chan.

Message from Consumer:
I DO NOT BELIEVE Adamstackhouse should be the winner of the PaRappa the Rapper Chop Chop Master 
Onion Contest, and there are a few others among the TOP TEN who all have VIOLATED THE POSTED 
OFFICIAL RULES.  Please allow me to describe the violations as I rewatch the saved videos from my 
PSP, and I quote the Official Rules at http://www.us.playstation.com/EP/Promotions/283/Rules.html.
 
"The performance must be a cappella (meaning without music), and it must be one of the three (3) 
songs that are provided on the contest entry page. The lyrics must be the same lyrics used in the 
game. Changing the lyrics will result in disqualification. Please do not include other people in 
your video as this will also result in disqualification."
 
And if you Don't believe me, you should watch the TEN videos again for yourselves.  *The bolded and 
underlined names are the names of the individuals who have violated the Officials Rules, and the 
BOLDED details are the obvious violations.
 
Video 1: adamstackhouse- IT HAS MUSIC - He has his SISTER IN THE VIDEO WITH HIM.
Video 2: ajbrewer- Nothing wrong here; no music, no lyric change, and he's all alone.  :)
Video 3: aprelewsky- IT HAS MUSIC - He has a DUDE IN THE VIDEO WITH HIM.
Video 4: Billjones- This one is cool; no music, no lyric change, and although it looks like there 
are two guys             in the video, upon closer inspection, they are both the same dude.  :)
Video 5: brudell- He has his DUDEFRIEND IN THE VIDEO WITH HIM.
Video 6: chrisadams- Although it is high on volume and echoful, he is all alone in the video, no 
music, and             he is quoting the lyrics from his printed sheet.  :)
Video 7: CWCSonichu *My Video*- Granted, I did start and end the video with an introduction and     
Guitar Hero ending, and that was only a photo of me and my friend, Megan; the rules do not state    
anything about photos.  I had the printed lyrics taped to the tripod holding the camera, and I did 
not             change any of the lyrics of Chop Chop Master Onion; that was why I was leaning 
forward at times in         the video.  And, obviously, I had no music during the song.  :)
Video 8: DSiferd- This is okay; no music, good lyric match, and like in Billjone's video; the leaf 
guy and             driver are both the same guy.  :)
Video 9: scotteichmer- Although it was too close to his face, there was no music, he matched the 
lyrics             (with a "That's it" at the end), and a stuffed monkey does not qualify as a 
person.  :)
Video 10: suryabuchwald- IT HAS MUSIC, and it sounds more like the theme to Super Mario Bros than   
Chop Chop Master Onion.  And I will note that upon close inspection, the three guys are the same    
dude.
 
I understand that it's too late to hold another election, but I suggest that you award the Grand 
Prize to the highest voted among the SIX Qualified Videos.
 
Thank you for your time, and please personally reply to this E-Mail As Soon As Possible, or call me

I understand the possible irriation from being touched, but I now realize what may have set off the burst of anger.  It was because of my immature behavior (with jealousy) over the winner of that contest, wasn't it?
I wanted you to know that I have honestly given up on that erronious behavior.  I do apologize for having expressed that anger, and I offer a peaceful rainbow as my promise to not get jealous and express such anger again.

You, Megan, truly are an inspiration for the better, even a neccessary "better half", for me.  I thank you for leading me toward the light of better judgement.

I hope to see you again soon.  <3<3<3<3

I took care of the video; I edited the original video by removing the pic, then I uploaded the new to repace the old.  So your face is not in there anymore.



I was depressed ALL DAY from those harsh words, but I'm not blaming you.  I can only guess something unexpected happened that wasn't in favor.  I apologize if I have offended you in any way.  Please don't leave me, Sweet Friend, Megan.



Faithfully yours;

Chris Chan.
