Glitter's Cap-Page Board
[[Image:Ourleaderladiesandgents.jpg|thumb|All hail the great L. Ron Glitterrock, who does totally not look [[gay]] in that outfit]]
'''Glitter's Cap-Page Board''' is a place where people who are upset that [[MST3K]] got cancelled, hangout and post unfunny captions for crappy movies and TV shows. These people formed a cult known as "The Cappers". Their leader, L. Ron Glitterrock, posts pictures of himself as a really gay looking disco supervillan from some Sid and Marty Krofft kid's show no one remembers. But he's really a fat guy with glasses. In fact, it can be assumed all of these people are fat, although they never use themselves as avatars. They write fanfiction about themselves living in the fictional "Anywhere, USA", saving the world, having orgies with their celebrity crushes.... get over yourselves, guys. You're a buncha bored twentysomethings sitting at home and captioning pictures.

And in this group of bored twentysomethings, you'll find the usual internet cliches:
* TheDiva - Annoying [[feminist]] know-it-all. [[Image:Stuckupknowitall.jpg|thumb|Typical TheDiva caption, starting with "Remind me again..." Well, at least it's better than when she goes on about how she is t3h genius because she's a librarian]]
* Tinaw - Black chick wit' attatude!
* TheLurker - [[fat]] [[emo]] girl. (<strike>who is also banned... is now apologizing and trying to get the blood off her hands by backstabbing LongLiveRock. EVERY CAPPER FOR HERSELF!</strike>) [[Image:LurkerMeltdown.jpg|thumb|Typical TheLurker caption in which she psychoticly declares her love for a certain [[Doctor Who]] actor]]
* LongLiveRock - Trendy girl with bad grammer.(Who got banned for contributing to this site)
* JohnSteed - [[otaku]]
* ChaosWolf - [[furry]]
* Gray Zombie - That guy who tries to sound really deep and stuff, but you know he's just wanking to naked pictures of Charisma Carpenter.
* PrezGar- [[unfunny]] perv obsessed with female [[Power Rangers]],[[Lindsay Lohan]], and other bad actresses.
* Cajunmagic- same as above, but likes the girl from [[Lazy Town]].

They claim everyone is welcome but really they're really elitist and will shun you if you don't get their [[unfunny]] "underwear on the ceiling" in-joke.
