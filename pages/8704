Urban dead
{{stub}}

A text based [[MMORPG]] in which you choose a [[zombie]] or human and duke it out in a city called Malton. Has nifty Firefox additions too. Has the capacity for fun but this capacity is rarely filled.

== Things to do ==
Walk around the city and collect ammo if you're a human and attack barricades if you're a zombie. If a human dies they become a zombie, and other humans can turn zombies into humans with a syringe.
Here are easy steps to playing

# Create a character <br>
# Whine about how repetitive the game is. Luckily you [[basement dweller|have no life and plenty of time to master it.]]<br>
# Wait ten hours for your guy to regain enough energy to walk ten screens. <br>
# Give yourself a trenchcoat and katana in your character description.<br>
# Die, turn into a zombie. You have no imagination and want to be the heroic good guy with a katana, so repeat step one.<br>

What you should Expect
*IF you visit this game you are greeted by registration and other [[Shit nobody cares about|douchefaggory]]. After that you  start [[the game]]. Now do not mistake the game for a [[Crap|menu bar]], this is all it is. It really is a bunch of buttons that lead to different areas. Now if you have the patience and retardation of an [[aspie]] you may just get far enough to die and become a zombie and then get healed or [[Shit nobody cares about|whatever]] and [[Divide by zero|get stuck in a loop]] of anus-munching.

==Drama==
Most of drama happens on the wiki, which the game uses in lieu of a forum. Although, that's not to say that there's no drama in game.  
====On the wiki drama====
From an [[internet tough guy]] [http://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php/UDWiki:Administration/Vandal_Banning/Archive/2008_08#User:Nallan threatening some fag], to suggesting that [http://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php/Suggestions/8th-Dec-2006#Prayer prayer be put in game], the wiki is never short of drama. Apparently, many people who play Urban Dead are also fans of [[Resident Evil]]. [[At least 100]] groups believe that they are "The true Umbrella" and they all constantly start wars with each other over it. Sysops abuse their powers regularly, and if you start trouble (Read: not agreeing with them) they'll find some random precedent for it and ban you because they can. <b>You</b> can help by suggesting that crucifixes have a practical purpose and screenshotting the results.

====In game drama====
Drama in game can generated by killing other players, different groups getting into a bitchfest over who can spray paint where, spamming the radio, and really any other way that you would flame someone on the interwebz

====Exploit Drama====
a nifty (yet now removed) address bar exploit would allow a player to perfor actions without using an energy, by selecting drop, canceling and adding the command to for the relevent action after it, in doing this, 2 long time players were able to completely rape the most heavily defended and guarded base in the entire game by them selves, they were banned shortly after and then I was too

Note to casual trolls: do not discover exploits and take credit for them if you want to keep playing thr game

== Trivia ==
- Was trolled by SA goons <s>once</s> [[twice]].<br>
- Both sides (zombies and humans) bitch the game is against them on the wiki<br>
- Has 1,162,854 dead and rising. (players)<br>
