Happy Tree Friends
{{tl;dr}}<br/>
{{warning|text=THEY ALL DIE IN EVERY EPISODE!}}

[[Image:CuddlesjacksoffJPEG.jpg|thumb|right|'Cute, Cuddly, and [[something awful|Horribly wrong!]]]]
Happy Tree Friends is a contrived, [[unfunny]] cartoon that features 'cuddly' animals being [[pain series|mutilated]]. It appeals to [[gothic|goffic]] tweens and [[basement-dwellers]] who attempt to [[rebel]] against society.

==History==
Originally sharing a place with the other faggots on Mondo Mini Shows, it soon outgrew them, with enough increased funding that it received its own URL.

Like a lot of others, it soon became a whore for money, and ''[[Some argue|in theory]]'', [[jumped the shark]].

==[[Happy Tree Friends Forum]]==
[[Image:Conversationforum.gif|left|thumb|200px|A common conversation among [[n00bs]] on the [[Happy Tree Friends]] forum. In this screenshot, we learn how to spell geese and ooh on a calculator.]]
The Happy Tree Friends Forum <s>was</s> a gathering place for [[furries]] and rip-off artists alike. The forum has been abused and vandalised for over four years by advertisers, as well as n00bs who range from the age of seven to 50 years of age. The forums went down in May and nobody gave a rat's ass, but as usual, we're here to document lulz for posterity.

===N00bs===
Getting an average of fifteen members a day, the forum is filled to it's limit with n00bs who continually drive forum veterans away. At right, you can see an interesting conversation among two n00bs, who are talking about [[shit nobody cares about|words you can write on a calculator]]. Most n00bs do end up getting their asses banned, but the number steadily increases day by day.

==In The Beginning...==
In the beginning, [[At least 100 years| at least 100 years ago]], the Happy Tree Friends forum was unknown to many. The few that did dwell there, however, lived in fear. Three [[trolls]] by the names of Lost Number, Mobile Type-8, and Raging Tiger [[raped]] and pillaged the land. No n00b was left unpwned, no member was excused from the violent [[gangbang]]. Several members were often left [[butthurt]] at the hands of The Three. [[Yoshi-lord]], [[IWP]], and [[faggot|PsychoCrash]] were among their primary targets and generated countless [[lulz]] for The Three. Many people threatened to seek the wielder of the [[Banhammer]], MondoAdmin, but he ignored their calls, and they were left to suffer the [[pwnage]]. A year went by, and no end to the [[lulz]] were in sight. However, one day, MondoAdmin woke up, feeling very unlulzy. He appointed Farallon as an admin so he wouldn't have to do his job. Farallon, in turn, appointed the first group of moderators who were among the most [[butthurt]] from The Three, including [[faggot|PsychoCrash]] and [[emo|UndrBlkSunshine]]. Lost Number was the first to suffer the might of the [[banhammer]], after a violent round of [[pwning]]. Mobile Type-8 saw the end was near and started [[pwning]] every member in sight until his end came. Raging Tiger, however, was kept around for a few more months due to UndrBlkSunshine's huge [[stalker|e-crush]] on him and her taste for black person [[cock|penis]]. However, PsychoCrash did not like his [[woman|wimminz]] swooning over some [[nigra]], and remembering the countless [[pwnt|pwnings]] at the hands of Raging Tiger, he banned the Tiger, effectively ending the reign of The Three. However, they are still remembered on the forums and are often quoted by the still-[[butthurt]] [[Yoshi-lord]].

===Romance?===
It was common knowledge that [[emo|UndrBlkSunshine]] had a massive [[stalker|e-crush]] on Raging Tiger and wanted to suck his [[cock|big black penis]]. He, however, would have nothing to do with that [[whore]] and continued to [[pwn]] her and her lover [[faggot|PsychoCrash]] relentlessly. Many [[lulz]] were had one fateful day when she had managed to dig up his phone number off the [[internet|intarwebz]] and called him several times. He, however, would not return the calls, and left her very [[angsty]] and [[suicidal]].

==Administrators==

[[Image:Mondoadmin.jpg|thumb|left|140px|''Mondoadmin''.]]
Mondoadmin is a mostly inactive [[admin|administrator]] on the [[Happy Tree Friends]] forum and serves no purpose whatsoever at Mondo Mini Shows besides updating the [[template]] every season.

===Farallon===
Farallon is a 30-something-year-old on the [[Happy Tree Friends]] forum who took the responsibilty of becoming an "[[admin|adminstrator]]". He does not work at Mondo Mini Shows, but a technical company in San Fransisco.

Mondotechdude has no purpose at Mondo Mini Shows but to be the laziest ass at the office, it has also been suspected that Mondotechdude was fired, from whatever he did at MMS, for getting caught jerking off. Either way, he hasn't been on the HTF forum since May 10, 2004.

==Moderators==

[[Image:Wouter.gif|left|thumb|140px|''Wouter van Toll'' AKA Burre.]]

Burre has also won the first [[Happy Tree Friends]] tournament that was created by an egotistical member named '''GARY'''. Burre has been regarded as one of the smartest and most reliable moderator on the forum, after fellow moderators Damien, and Dominus. Not really a surprise because all the other moderators are unreliable [[assholes|idiots]].
[[Image:Netherlands.gif|left|thumb|150px|The Netherlands.]]

===digitalis===
[[Image:Junyun.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''digitalis''.]]

Dominus is one of the newest moderators on the [[Happy Tree Friends]] forum along with fellow moderator NYC_Tooothy_LA. The only reason that Dominus was given the moderating position was because the moderator he replaced didn't give a shit at all about the forum. Dominus co-moderates two sub-forums along with digitalis. A moderator who serves no purpose in his position now, since the character tournament that he managed was moved to a different section, taking away his moderating powers in the sub-forum. Dominus is most famous on the forum for creating a thread entitled [http://forum.happytreefriends.com/showthread.php?t=18558 "The Happy Tree Friends Season Two Petition], which was created to demand a second season of the Happy Tree Friends TV series that was most likely going to be ordered by G4 Tech TV anyway, since it is their only source of viewership. Dominus is also known for writing entries that require multiple posts to fit all of what he has to say into the thread that he is replying to, or creating. 
Note: It is easy to get Dominus confused with Flipping Out since they both have Giggles avatars and write in a ridicules poetic style.

===Damien===
[[Image:Damien.jpg|right|thumb|150px|''Damien''.]]
[[hippie|Damien]] was [[loser|appointed moderator]] on the [[Happy Tree Friends]] forum to replace a failure of mod known as Madamluna, who couldn't handle the pressure of looking after the section know as the [http://forum.happytreefriends.com/forumdisplay.php?f=5 Sharing Tree]. A section for displaying crappy artwork that users have created. Damien is regared as one of the [[nerd|smartest]] users on the board, since he uses wit in his posts to make a point. Damien has once been impersonated by a member with the username Nutt, who created an account with the username ''Damienn''. Stupid members (95%) were tricked into believing that Damien had gone crazy, and was soon reported by multiple (l)users. He was then later banned and upon further investigation, Nutt's original account was permabanned. Another similar occurrence was the impersonation of another moderator who was away, just like Damien.
[[Image:VanDriesen.jpg|left|thumb|140px|''Damien'' at school.]]

[[Image:FurbyOrange.jpg|right|thumb|170px|''NYC Tooothy LA''.]]

NYC Tooothy LA is was appointed as moerator to replace a pathetic moderator known as rsk423 who abandoned the forum after realizing that he was a [[pwned|failure at life]]. NYC Tooothy LA was chosen primarily because his posts taken a whole page when viewed on an 800x600 screen resolution, which is a must (in most cases) if you want to be appointed a moderator.

[[Image:Emily.gif|left|thumb|160px|''EmilyDoOmSqueak'' being  gothic.]]
EmilyDoOmSqueak is a moderator on the Happy Tree Friends forum. Leaving twice for an extended period of time to do God knows what somehow qualifies her to become a moderator.

===UndrBlkSunshine===

UndrBlkSunshine was once a co-mod along with her bi-sexual boyfriend PsychoCrash on the Happy Tree Friends forum. She usually was on the site 24/7 to delete various threads and ban tactless members, since her homo boyfriend was an inactive lazy bastard who signed on only once in every few months. she was constantly labelled as a snotty bitch, possibly because it was the truth; as all of her posts consisted of looking down at other members and giving every hint that she was better than everyone. Aside from vigorously insulting people for no reason, camwhoring her pale ugly self, constantly being a bitch and all that.. she didn't really contribute much. As of April 2006, she has been inactive and has claimed to have left for good. Reasons rumored being because she has broken up with her unfaithful boyfriend PsychoCrash, due from cheating on her and having gay affairs with hermaphrodite moderator, known as Poonchy. She also has been claimed to have gone suicidal, or has hopefully already killed herself.

==Forum Fucktards and Associated Artists==
===Tori Sue Heck===
[[Image:Lolzors.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Yeah, baby.]]
{{main|Tori Sue Heck}}
Tori Sue Heck, or TulipTori, is a bitchy, aggressive, pushy, [[crack]]-addicted [[drama whore]] who is currently a big fan of [[Happy Tree Friends]] and is overly [[fangirl|obsessed]] with it.

She used to hold art threads [[at least 100]] years ago on the forums and basically flamed, raped or tried to [[banhammer|ban]] anyone who posted something that somehow pissed her off.  She eventually decided to leave the forums and she moved to a [[Sheezyart]] ripoff named [[FanArt Central]].  At the time of joining the site had quite a big community of HTF fan artists.  She drew many [[crap|crappy]] pieces of [[MSPaint]] work, and half of it was Hate-Art directed at [[Mary sue|Mary-sues]] (despite being one herself) and [[MySpace]] (lol no wonder). She eventually got an account at [[DeviantArt]] and that's when it all started.

[[Image:Torithefatass.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Even her [[fursona]] is a fatass.]]
On DeviantArt she copied alot of her art from FAC to there.  On DA she met many of the people she [[butthurt|hated]] in the forums and she began flaming them once again.  This resulted in much hate-art, spam spills, napalm explosions and [[lulz]]. Meanwhile, Tulip had created another account on FAC and created some more Hate-Art and some more pointless OC's.  Tulip had manipulated several other stupid HTF fan artists into joining the dark side and the burnt ones could no longer stand this, so they started the Anti-Tori club to support the victims of her rampage.

She is a huge [[hugbox]] whore. She is known to [[waaaambulance|take any situation, blow it way out of proportion, and then submit it to her journal]] so all of her [[retard|friends]] [[fucktard|will go "OMG! I am soooo sorri that hapend to u! I cant beleev thos basturds did tat to u!!!]]". She is a complete bitch and tries to attack anyone whose views are different from hers, or just anyone of whom she is jealous because their art is better than hers. She hates having her art critiqued, and if you try to give her any constructive criticism, she will go on a rampage to try (and [[fail]]} to flame your ass and all your submissions straight to hell. 
[[Image:Ohshizy.jpg|left|thumb|160px|The [[fugly|sex]].]]
She hates anyone from myspace, [[/b/|/b/tards]], EDiots, and everybody with any discernible talent. She thinks everyone should bow down to her like she's a fucking queen, and her only real friends are people who do anything she says, kiss her ass at ever opportunity, and basically don't think for themselves at all. In fact, she even pisses some of her friends of by doing anything [[awesome|that pisses her off]]. She will not hesitate to give you a piece of her mind, and will call anyone who does not agree with her stupid, lame, retarded, or say they have no life, which is kind of [[irony|ironic]] considering she fits all of those perfectly. She pretends not to care when someone insults her, then she whines about it all day to her "friends". Any time she is angry with someone, instead of confronting them herself she gets all of her minions to do it for them. Her only reason for doing this is because she's a fat ugly bitch with no wit or intelligence and knows that she'd get pwned by almost anyone. Even a few of her friends don't even like her, seeing as they may or may not be secret agents intending to convey her personal information to some of her enemies, such as Suzie Q and Anonymous. And recently, it's been discovered that she is a racist, after she was seen laughing at a racist comment made on her journal, but then denied it, hid the comment and deleted the journal like the sissy bitch that she is. Her most reliable friend is Ghuiado, <strike>who thinks she's hot and wants to get a piece of her fat ass. Her fat ass</strike> recently <strike>left her for another girl, who is most likely more attractive and less of a bitch</strike> took her fatass back after breaking up with his other girlfriend. It's a wonder her fat ass hasn't been banned yet from both the Happy Tree Friends forum and deviantART.

===IWP/IWP2===

''IWP is a 17 year old hippy who draws shitty art of himself having furry crayon sex. It is unknown if he uses Crayola, or Rose Art.''

[[FAIL|This failure]], also known as Scott to some people (3,maybe 4), likes to draw shitty art of his two bisexual furry fantasies and himself, giving each other handjobs n' shit. IWP reckons he is hardcore, as he drinks beer, but really, he is just another [[furfag]], who has nothing better to do with their life. He was known for apparently, being the biggest Petunia [[rape|loving]] [[furry]] on the forum. He listens to [[poser|metal]](!!!) bands like [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Pantera]]. Recently, he was banned from the forum for [[racism|hatin]] black person, which is kind of strange because another user called MikeFox124 was banned for being a black person.

===Mikefox124===
[[Image:MikeCrews.jpg|left|thumb|110px|Mike is the one on the right.]]
Mikefox124, or Michael "Mike" Crews, is a black person  who pretends to be a bad ass, and usually ends up just embarassing himself. Mike has been banned multiple times from DeviantART because he is a slob.

Racoon is an unbelievably miserable thirteen-year old [[emo]] girl named Anna. She is a classified [[dyke|lesbian]] and a furry.

Married Wescravendevon once to hide the fact that she is a [[lesbian|dyke]].

===16 Valve Hate===
The forum zit. Internet-addicted nerd who simply practices better personal hygeine online than he does in real life. He frequently seems to think he is intelligent as shit in all his posts, only making him look like the smartest kid with down syndrome.

===Wescravendevon===
A little faggot who thinks he's hilarious. He was banned for being unfunny and buttfucking Raccoonbros665 too much, this of course makes the HTF admins a better example since they banned this fucking fucker. He was later sent to the aids pool.

He has also been claimed to have a disturbing sexual fetishism for various video game characters, such as Yoshi or Pikachu.

She even made a devil spawn, other known as the pissing Jun. She thinks that pissing babies is ultra kawaii desu and will fap to her own pictures of the demon child.

Bawwww, but seriously. Once a week she is threating with suicide. She's making shitty butthurt journals about them and she's constantly bawwing about that she's made fun of in real life.

He sees himself as the furry king of [[Hyrule]] and faps to pictures of Zelda and sticks N64 cartridges up his @r$e. If you come across him, a picture of Ganon should do the trick, causing him to fold like a paper and wither away, his last words being "MAH BOI".
