Windsor
[[Image:Welcome to Windsor.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome to Windsor! We're #1!]]
'''Windsor''' (should be called Losedsor or Faildsor), in southern <strike>Ontario</strike> Onterrible, is [[Canadia]]'s lame attempt at [[fail|out-doing]] [[Detroit]], by [[shit]]ting out quite possibly the most [[Shit nobody cares about|boring, crime-riddled city on earth]].  The city [[epic fail|used to be home to factories, but now these are all closed and rusted out]], where [[fag]]s live, as they renovate them into lofts for [[rape]] of unsuspecting visitors from [[Toledo]] and Detroit.  Ever striving to emulate and be just like its bigger neighbour, [[Detroit|Niggertown]], Windsor (New Niggertown) is quickly approaching Detroit in all aspects of life, with the majority of its houses on the west end either abandoned or burned-out shells <sup>[http://www.windsorstar.com/news/stabbed+back/1778528/story.html] [http://www.windsorstar.com/news/stabbed+back/1778528/story.html]</sup>.  [http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=2a789068-6bce-4ea0-a540-03d14c910980 Just some of the fail from 2007 alone].

== History ==
The city (more like shitty, [[amirite]]?) was founded by the [[French]], who were tired of getting [[gang rape]]d in Montreal in 1749, ensuring it would fail for the rest of eternity.  After the first few winters, their population dwindled to nearly nothing from cannibalism, before being replenished by the [[fags|British]].  During the war of 1812, Windsor was used as a base by the British to raid America's [[Fort Longcat|Fort Detroit]], located across the river.  [[Shit nobody cares about|The city also had a couple minor rebellions in 1836 and 1837]], [[fail|but these were unnoticed by the British overlords]].

Windsor was also the [[Goatse|exit point]] for slaves trying to [[tubgirl|escape]] [[whitey|massah]] on the [[subway|Underground Railroad]], making sure Windsor would share in Detroit's curse of the darkies.

The only real important things that happened since, were the factories in Windsor being converted to military use during the second World War to fight the [[Nazi]]s, but after that, it was back to [[epic fail|business as usual]].  After the war, London somehow [[in the ass|surpassed]] Windsor as the "anchor" city of southern Ontario.

Shortly after the war, Windsor was [[butthurt]] by one of the most powerful [[Giant dildo of death|tornadoes]] in Canada, which proves there is a [[God]] after all and even ''He'' wants to destroy Windsor... too bad Windsor's fail was too much for him to overcome and obliterate the miserable city.  Further attempts in 1973, 1997, and 2009 were [[epic fail|horrible failures]] at destroying the city, simply blowing trash and [[emofags]] about.

Desperate to boost its [[gay|lowering population rate]], Windsor legalized topless women in 1996, but oops!  This only increased its already high gay community by attracting [[lesbians]]!  Thus is the fail that is Windsor's Shitty Council.

In 2007, Canada was [[epic win|partially relieved of its responsibilities]] of having to deal with Windsor and all of its [[trailer-trash]] people, when the city was made an "honorary part of [[Michigan]]".  Windsor Mayor [[arab|Eddie Francis]] was invited to speak at the Mackinac Conference (basically, the "mayors of Michigan" club).

In 2009, the city's paper announced that its only [[cock|private]] television station, [[Ass|Ass Channel]], would be <strike>shutting down</strike> nope, staying on the air.  Apparently, the situation of fail is so extensive and serious in Windsor, that not even the MEDIA wants to stick around.

[[Image:CUPE local 82 strikers.jpg|thumb|right|CUPE fags dumping garbage [[wtf|ON THEIR OWN PARKING LOT]]!]]
<strike>The city is currently [[trying too hard|battling two strikes]] from [[commies|unions]] right now, with [[drama llama|cab driver]]s for once not in their smelly cabs, and city workers not picking up garbage or mowing grass in the parks, so the whole city looks like [[Philadelphia|Filthadelphia]] and Detroit combined, and the city smells like an unshaven french-woman's armpit covered in sour cream and left out in the sun. No, that would be an improvement.  It smells like [[God]] ate the most awful [[hindu|Indian]] food ever, [[shit]] all over the city, shaved off his ass-hair over Whine-sor, then [[vomit]]ed on top of that <sup>[http://www.windsorstar.com/business/Hope+grows+CUPE+city+talks/1778459/story.html] [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/union-windsor-to-meet-for-first-time-since-mid-june/article1209505/] [http://www.windsorstar.com/news/CUPE+makes+final+offer+City+Windsor/1779702/story.html] [http://www.windsorstar.com/technology/Henderson+Ways+work+around+CUPE+garbage+strike/1533653/story.html]</sup>.  Apparently, the [[moralfag|striker]]s think it's [[dirty|wrong for anyone to clean up after themselves]], except for [[lol|other CUPE members]], who proceed to toss their [[hypocrite|garbage out on their own union hall's lot]].  [[unrealistic expectations|This is all because the union wants the city to pay them all the jew gold]] they have, but they forgot that Windsor is a fucking poor-ass city, because niggers, micks, and camel-jockeys [[truth|have no money]].  [http://www.thestar.com/comment/article/593773 Oh dear god, it's spread to Toronto!] <sup>[http://search.cnn.com/search.jsp?query=Toronto%20Garbage%20Strike&type=web&sortBy=date&intl=false]</sup> [http://search.cnn.com/search?query=Toronto+Garbage+Strike&type=video&sortBy=date&intl=false CNN's videos on the garbage strike]</strike> Nope. It's over. Windsor is still shitty though.

== Crime ==
Crime in Windsor is high, ok?  I mean really REALLY fucking high.  90% of the crimes are committed by police, while the other 80% are committed by [[drug]] addicts trying to score money for [[hookers and blow]] or oxycontin and oxytocin, the drugs of choice in Windsor.  Windsor constantly strives to have [[MOAR]] murders than Detroit, [[Toronto]], and Deadmonton combined, and [[fail|falls short]] because of its lower population.

This very high crime rate might be linked to the large number of welfare addicts and drugs in the city, or more likely, from all the fail the city has.  Because of a guy named Jew (This is is REAL name. This Detroit man is somehow worth three billion dollars.) [[lol|buying up homes in the west end for his bridge]] to let them become abandoned squat houses and meth labs, most people in Windsor are [[homeless]] <sup>[http://www.windsorstar.com/news/Citizens+oppose+twin+span/1738915/story.html] [http://www.windsorstar.com/technology/Moroun+suffers+setback+plan+twin+Ambassador+Bridge/1698060/story.html] [http://www.windsorstar.com/technology/halts+twin+span+demands+answers/1700686/story.html]</sup>.

Adding to the fail are all the Mexican, [[beaner]], [[Jamaican]] and [[Mexican]] workers in nearby Leamington, who all gravitate to the smelly pile of shit that is Windsor, thinking it is just like home, as it is dirty, smells bad, and is made of fail.  WARNING: Now called New Jamaica from all the Jamaican and Mexican migrant workers.

Overall, Windsor is a reflection of a changing Canada and how it is becoming a diverse melting pot of FAIL, with [[Hindu]]s, [[irish|micks]], [[arabs|sand niggers]], [[paki]]s, [[niggers|urban-dwellers]], [[homeless|n8ive]] drunks and [[faggots|white people]] all living in [[Robot Unicorn Attack|harmony]].

[[Last Thursday|Just a few days ago]] (literally a [[Caturday|Thursday]]), a Windsor police officer was busted at the Ambassador Bridge in a sting operation by the RCMP and his [[YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG|own fellow Windsor Police Officers]] while trying to smuggle a large amount of undeclared non-duty-paid cigarettes into Canada from the United States.

== Culture ==
[[Image:Injury.jpg|thumb|This kid lives in Windsor.]]
Windsor is a culturally-diverse city, filled up with mostly [[arabs|sand-niggers]] from Lebanon (one of whom is the Mayor of this festering boil on Ontario's ass), [[irish|micks]] in Forest Glade, [[guido]]s that live on Erie Street, and of course, [[niggers|those of the urban persuasion]] along the riverfront, where they can see their [[Detroit|beloved home]].  The remainder of the city is populated by [[white trash]] stuck on welfare and too poor to leave the city, which may be the only good thing about Windsor, saving its outer suburbs like Lakeshore, La Salle ([http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salle_de_bains french for "the toilet"], [[emofags|they hate being reminded of this!]]) and Tecumseh (should be called To-CUM-sex, since only sex-addicts and rich pimps live here).

[[Image:Windsor furs building.jpg|thumb|The Windsor Furs Building, Downtown Windsor.  This is where the [[Furluminati]] of [[Japan]][[Canada|ada]] meet for their [[israel|world domination]] meetings, aka "conventions", cleverly disguised as a fur coat store.]]
The city has a rather deep obsession with [[furry|furs]], as it has a large old building dedicated TO them, as well as having a [[fag|deer]] on its coat of arms.  The Windsor Shitfires hockey team has a [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|dragon]] as its mascot ("Duke the Ice Dragon", who is really just [[Trodgor]] under witness protection after being [[V&]]), and to further cement its place in the hall of fail, it places a giant [[facepalm|rose]] on its flag.

The city is best known for its [[strippers|Windsor Ballet]].

To match its fail, [[some argue]] that the British sold Canada the subs just so Canada would name one after Windsor.  These are the very subs that somehow [[epic fail|catch fire while under water]] <sup>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsubs/chicoutimitimeline.html] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/3717906.stm]</sup>.

Nearly all of Windsor's [[retarded]], [[disabled]], and [[assburgers]] patients are currently [[homeless|living on the street]] because of overcrowding of [[niggers]] and [[Arabs]] at the [http://www.windsorstar.com/business/million+local+housing+disabled/1778955/story.html homeless shelters].

One of Windsor's favourite pastimes is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ9ox3eNerY harassing their neighbours and acting like douches].

Windsor's legacy of fail has not gone unnoticed, as [[Stephen Colbert]] has finally given Windsor the [http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=4ef1e744-f814-4829-869a-e1ed0a368857 recognition it so desperately deserves].

== Geography ==
[[Image:DetroitStreet.jpg|thumb|A Detroit street.  Windsor looks pretty much the same.]]
[[Image:Tubgirl.jpg|thumb|Windsor's [[Tubgirl|Peace Fountain]] at Pilette Road [[docking|Dock]].]]
Like its [[ghey|bigger brother]] Detroit, Windsor is largely (~90%) [[The Ghetto|ghetto]], with the highest concentrations of it being in Downtown, West Windsor/Sandwich Town, and Walkerville.

*'''Forest Glade''': This is where the newly-settled [[paki]]s and Arab live, also home to some of the last remaining [[white|right]] people in the city.
*'''Downtown''': A constant battleground between the native [[guido]]s, the [[niggers]], the [[irish]], and the [[pakis|sand-niggers]].
*'''Wyandotte Street''': The western half is filled with [[Azns]], [[chinks]], [[gooks]], and [[weeaboo]] [[furfags]] that love all the Vietnamese and Chinese writing, while the eastern half is filled with [[arab|Lebanese]] [[furfags]] and [[irish|micks]], in other words... AVOID!
*'''West Windsor''': A nice place to go if you like being stabbed to death, [[raped]], [[almost raped]], [[gun|shot]], and then raped again by [[spics]] and blacks, especially along Bloomfield and Chippewa.  If you're a Canadian and want to get the "[[Rape|Detroit Experience]]" but can't cross the border, this is the next best thing.  A church in this part of town that commemorates the Underground Railroad and [[lie|African-Canadian heritage]] is [[win|constantly vandalised by the same blacks in the neighbourhood that attend]].
*'''South Windsor''' (also known as Jew): This is where the city's Jewish population lives.
*'''Sandwich Town''': People eat sandwiches here because they're too fucking poor to eat anything else.  Also, founded by the French in 1791 (who still live there to this day) and has the [[lulz]]iest [[jail]] in Ontario, [[internet jail|Windsor Jail]].
*'''Walkerville''': [[Furfags]] live here, also everyone's too poor to own a car, so they walk.
*'''Tecumseh''': Half of Windsor's city employees and police live here, since Windsor's fail is too overpowering for them to stand for any extended period of time.  [[hypocrite|They hate to give Windsorites anything, but have to use their hospitals and water services]].
*'''La Salle''': Inhabited by Irish and French people, they hate Windsor almost as much as Tecumseh.
*'''Lakeshore''': A group of homes that wanted to be connected to Windsor by bus routes for some [[retard|stupid reason]].  It was a miracle that Tecumseh refused to let buses through, thus saving them from (most of the) fail.
*'''Walker Farms''': There aren't any farms here anymore... it's all tool and die mold factories that spew out molds for cars. Oh, there are a couple [[V-Tech|high-tech]] suppliers, a [[Church of Fudge|Gospel Temple]], and the bus station.
*'''Windsor Airport''': The only city in Canada that has an airport built NEXT to a subdivision, where [[Dongcopter|Russian planes]] routinely almost crash into houses on [[Liberty|Riberty Road]] when they [[fact|overshoot the runway]].

Even maps hate Windsor, because Southern Ontario looks like [[guro|intestines]], with Windsor being positioned [[ass|as]] the [[asshole]] of the country, shoved up against Detroit in the impossible hope that "The D" will [[unrealistic expectations|annex Windsor]].

== (What) Economy ==
[[Image:torched windsor factory.jpg|thumb|Like most other factories in Windsor, this one was burned down because people hate work.]]
Aside from [[unemployment]] and [[fail]], this rusted colossus of a city's primary exports are [[AIDS]] and [[mudkipz]], which are found in the green sludge that passes as water in the Detroit River.  Its sole claim to fame is being mentioned as "South Detroit" in Journey's "Don't Stop Believin'", which actually refers to its arch-rival in fail, [[Toledo]], but Windsor, ever striving to out-fail everything around it, insists that it is the city in question.  Also present in the ghost town that has become downtown are the [[over 9000|hundreds]] of kiddie bars that cater to 19 and 20-year-old [[niggers|Detroiters]] wanting to get drunk off their asses, piss in the streets, and fight with the local [[cops|criminals]].  The only other thing in downtown (aside from [[Ass|Ass Channel]]) is the Casino, where people waste their money on expensive food and [[sluts]], with all the profit going to the local [[guidos]].

Until the [[LOL WUT|auto industry collapsed]], Windsor boasted six, yes SIX automobile plants from GM, [[Fuck|Ford]], and [[Jesus Christ|Chrysler]], but now, only two are running today.  GM went [[dead|tits-up bankrupt]], Ford [[rape|pulled out]] after fucking Windsor [[in the ass|hard]], and the Chrysler plant is making [[hitler|Volkswagons]].  During the [[shit nobody cares about|boom times]], Windsor started a rivalry with [[Toronto|Oshawa]] for the [[do not want|coveted title]] of [[Unwarranted self-importance|Automotive Capital of Canada]].  Windsor failed so hard, that GM moved its headquarters to Oshawa in 1998, and Ford followed in 2003, with Chrysler constantly mulling the idea of moving their headquarters to a less shit-tacular city, like [[Hamilton]] or Toronto instead.  Jealous of other cities' success, Windsor has been known to [[wtf|force its newspaper to insult Kitchener's city council]] when they try to attract what few jobs Windsor has left.

Also located in Windsor, is the Hire'em Walkerz booze factory, built specifically to keep Windsorites [[drunk]], [[stupid]], and stuck on [[fail|welfail]].

Although Stats Canada officially declared Windsor's unemployment rate an [http://www.windsorstar.com/business/Windsor+jobless+rate+climbs+nation+highest/1779806/story.html already-lulzy <strike>14.4%</strike> 15.7% now], the actual number is around 27% when you include the [[fat]] [[fugly]] single [[teen mom]]s on welfare, [[assburgers]] people on disability, and [[emofags]] that have just given up hope of ever finding a job.  For those that know their [[mathematics|math of lulz]], when you get a city that has at least one in seven to one in four not working, the city is failing very VERY hard, and the more it's pwned, the lulzier it gets.

== Edjumacayshun ==
[[Image:Assfuckwut.jpg|thumb|right|Sex ed, Windsor-style.]]
Windsor's schools are either [[Pool's Closed|closed]] or over-crowded and rat-infested, and the [[ITT Tech|University of Windsor]] is consistently ranked on the bottom of "universities to enroll at" from its Jew and teachers that would rather spend their time on [[hookers and blow]] in Downtown.

== Sports ==
The main sports in Windsor are [[buttsecks]] and [[hockey]], both equally-represented by the Windsor <strike>Spitfires</strike> Shitfires (seriously, do they even THINK of names there?).  The Shitfires were known as the [[lulz]]iest team in Canada because they have only won a single game in their entire existence, in 2009.

The other major sports in Windsor include extreme rape, hit-and-run, click-clack at the Casino, and break-and-enters.

== Notable Residents ==

== How to get to Windsor ==
[[Image:Hello.jpg|thumb|the Windsor entrance of the Windsor-Detroit Tunnel]]
If you're fucking stupid enough to [[party van|drive down Highway 401]] past Tilbury, it's too late to turn back.  If you're [[cum]]ming from Detroit, you have to hold your breath for a mile through the [[fart|poison-gas]]-filled Tunnel or wait ten hours to go over the 90-year-old rusted-out Amb[[ass]]<span>ador</span> Bridge.  Assuming you get here alive, you won't return.
