BSDcode
'''BSDcode''' is an [[IRC]] channel on [[EFnet]] where a lot of [[FreeBSD]] [[drama]] originates.

Many prominent (and not so prominent) FreeBSD developers hang out there, as well as a number of notable [[scenewhore]]s and similar scum.  Once upon a time, it was not keyed, and its mere existence was something to be kept secret, and new people arriving were a source of much drama.  Now, it is keyed, with the key occasionally rotating whenever there is a lot of trouble going on in the channel.  Once a favorite for [[troll]]s looking for information to use against the FreeBSD community, now there is seldom anything particularly special shared in <nowiki>#</nowiki>BSDcode, as far as FreeBSD information goes.  It used to be so intense that after nights of arguments on channel, it was not uncommon to see various developers [[quitting IRC forever|quitting FreeBSD forever]].  For a while, there was some status associated with being on <nowiki>#</nowiki>BSDcode.  Now, it just means you're not cool enough to get in to the ''real'' secret FreeBSD cabal channel.
