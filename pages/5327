'''Metallica''' is a [[Lie|totally awesome]] group of 4 [[gays|homosexuals]] who like to make their version of "[[shit|music]]" in between their intense rock sessions. They are most known for regularly releasing kickass albums and suing the entire internet.

In recent years, Metallica members have had to dodge many hit-squads formed by [[butthurt|outraged]], deranged teenage and [[Mormon|twenty-something]] fans who felt their betrayal as an internal knife into the heart (it does hurt that bad), to have their heroes who once stood up against the hypocrisy of the world and expressed sublime art, turn into self-complacent, passionless multimillionaire traitors to their now love-lorn base.

The rumors that Metallica is made of pure shit are false.  Metallica is only 50% shit, with 25% being [[ass]] and the other 25% is pure [[Pegging|Pegging]]
==History==

===Milking Mustaine's Material===

Metallica was formed [[at least 100 years ago]] by guitarist '''James Hetfield''', bassist '''[[shit nobody cares about|Ron McGovny]]''', lead guitarist '''Dave Mustaine''' (who got kicked out two years later) and [[Danish]] drummer '''[[butthurt|Lars Ulrich]]'''. Hetfield initially used and abused his [[aspie]] friend from highschool McGovney for his van. Eventually McGovney quit taking their abuse after Mustaine trolled him by pouring beer down the neck of McGovney's bass, pwning him in the process and sending him flying across a room. Not that it mattered anyway as Metallica, being the jerkoffs they were, already had his replacement ready long before; '''Cliff Burton''', another aspie who they actually liked and was actually [[gay|talented]].

[[Image:Metallica_mustaine03.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Ah... the good old days, when we was still friends and spooned each other.]]

However, Mustaine was too much of an [[IRL]] tough guy. He would regularly beat the shit out of the other band members after getting shitfaced on beer, which is ironic since [[truth|Metallica's nickname for a long time was "'''Alcohollica'''"]] (so one has to imagine that Mustaine was in fact [[i told u i was hardcore|as hardcore as he told us]]). The final straw came when Hetfield kicked Mustaine's dog. Mustaine proceeded to beat the crap out of Hetfield and tossed Mcgoveny across a room; so Metallica did what every other hardcore, alcohol-abusing band would do: they kicked him out of the band... of course he rejoined [[gay|later...]]. They sent Mustaine on a bus home with all his crap and hired some half-Philippine effeminate guy called '''Jew''' who played for a band that opened for them. Mustaine never actually recovered from this traumatic experience and is still butthurt over the whole ordeal. As we can see from clip above (from the shitty Metallica's in emo therapy movie '''[[Emo|Some Kind of Monster]]'''), Mustaine clearly has abandonment issues despite becoming a [[God]] and rich fuck with his own [[Gay|kickass]] metal band [[awesome|Megadeth]].



With the new lineup, the band proceeded to make their first record [[Cho Seung-Hui|'''Kill 'Em All''']], though being the unimaginative fucks they were, they decided that it wasn't enough to just boot Mustaine out of the band but they should also steal his material for at least half the songs on their debut album (and some later), it wasn't like they were gonna be famous or anything, amirite?


Having released their third album [[BDSM|'''Master of Puppets''']], Metallica had managed to change metal from something that was about [[transvestite|hairspray and eye-liner]] into something about [[BDSM|leather and denim]]. It was also shortly after this, that they were touring [[Sweden]], as it happens the tour bus was speeding down the highway and crashed due to the driver being drunk off his ass. [[Lie|Unfortunately]] only one of the members died, the most talented one at that, Burton managed to go flying out of the top window next to his bunk and ended up [[LOL|crushed under the bus]] itself. When the rescue services arrived, they tried to save him but instead managed to [[facepalm|drop the bus on him again]], effectively permabanning him IRL in the process.

===End of The [[good|Old]] Metallica===

[[Image:METALLICAGX.jpg|thumb|right|Metallica: As [[fail|badass]] as it gets.]]

Metallica got butthurt for a while but eventually replaced him, by means of a [[American Idol|mass audition]], yet again they picked ''another'' aspie '''Jason [[newfag|Newsted]]''', who this time they picked on and bullied cos he was the [[noob|"new guy"]]. They would troll him by pelting the food from the buffet tables at him, they would tell everyone he was gay, and at hotels, they would have him pay for all their room service and 50 uneaten lobster dinners.

[[Image:Newstedhawt.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Newsted [[DOING IT WRONG|trying too hard.]]]]

Metallica went on to record their next album [[For Great Justice|'''...And Justice For All''']], notably with the death of the only talented member and having ran out of Mustaine's material, Metallica had to actually write [[original content]] for the first time. So basically, they thought that if Master of Puppets was awesome, why not do the same thing but make MOAR of it, cos people like more amirite? The end result was an album full of songs that were at least 7 minutes long and sounded like Master of Puppets II. Not only that, Ulrich being the short man with unwarranted self-importance, appears to have much more presence than the other members do, which is retarded as he is a drummer, not to mention it sounded as though Newsted's bass was turned off during recording. Despite this, rabid Metallica fanboys ate up the album like the sheep they were and to this day still praise it, despite Metallica knowing deep down inside, that they fucked this one up, as they never play any songs from that album live. Ironically, Metallica were nominated for a [[shit|Grammy]] in the category "Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance" for this album in 1989 but lost out to some [[lol|flute playing]] shitty band called Jethro Tull.

After passing out that turd, Metallica then fired their producer '''[[Danish|Flemming Rasmussen]]''' cos he was like [[lie|totally responsible]] for the last album (and the two before but who's counting), and hired some [[gay|glam metal]] producer '''Bob Rock'''. With the help of Rock, they produced the biggest selling metal album of all time. [[pretentious|Self titled]] otherwise known as '''The [[Black]] Album''' as it's affectionately called by Metallica fans, effectively boosted and cemented Metallica's already overinflated ego. However such success in metal never goes without butthurt though, as there was much [[butthurt|backlash]] among a lot of the oldfag fans who missed the [[plagiarism|old Metallica]], complaining that the new music was [[retard|a lot slower, streamlined and insincere]] i.e. They [[sell out|sold out]]  but hey what do they know, [[Britney Spears|22 million copies in sales can't be wrong]], amirite?

===[[gay|Experimental Era]]===
[[Image:METALLICA LIEKS BACON.jpg|thumb|right|Metallica are not Jewish despite persistent rumours]]
Metallica, probably being the only metal band the average soccer mom knew, decided to take advantage of their mediocre fame. If fans were butthurt over the last album, one could only imagine the shitstorm following Metallica's next album, aptly named '''[[cum|Load]]'''. Metallica knew that thrash metal was only a passing fad, a minor one at that, and that if they were going to eat lobster everyday for the rest of their lives, something had to be done...
[[Image:Metallica - Load - back - like totally didn't sell out guys.jpg|thumb|right|Like totally didn't sellout]]
When unsuspecting fans went out to buy their troll of an album, they were greeted on the front cover by a lovely "artistic" photo of an [[sick fuck|artist's own semen mixed with bovine blood]]. Also gone was the old logo and its place, a feeble attempt at reinventing themselves, and it got ''much'' worse. On the back we could see every [[pretentious|indie/underground music]] loving fan's worst nightmare, one could see Metallica actually ''enjoying'' the fruits of their labour, fancy clothes and fine cigars, not to mention [[BAW|they cut their hair!]] All this and perhaps more may have been forgiveable had the CD itself had any redeeming music, but alas, '''Metal'''lica in the [[lie|best interest's of their fans]] decided to [[irony|abandon metal music]] altogether and embrace [[wtf|alternative rock]]. No longer did they sing about [[shit nobody cares about|death, pain, shitty literature references, and injustice]], they instead sung about their [[emo|angst, and inner feelings]]. Not to mention the music itself was dumbed down yet again, and filled with uber funky cool effects that those angst-ridden teens love.

[[Image:MetalliFAIL.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of a starving artist]] 

The following year Metallica released '''[[moar|Re-Load]]''', it doesn't really deserve its own paragraph but to put it in Lars Ulrich's own words:

{{quote|We wrote 27 songs for Load and were developing it as a double album. We then got the [[cash|offer]] [in January 1996] to play [[lol|Lollapalooza]] [that summer] and [decided] we [would] put one record out now with most of the songs that are done and then we [would] come back after a year and finish the rest of them. As far as I'm concerned, [[facepalm|you can take any of these songs and interchange them on the two albums.]]|Lars being a little too honest}}

Also to note, Metallica could have easily released a double album of this crap, but instead opted to further milk their fans by essentially releasing the same album twice and were totally open about this. Whether Metallica have the balls to do it again remains to be seen, but judging by their [[retards|fanbase]], it seems all too likely to happen again.

Metallica being hampered by some creative block as evident by releasing Load II, continued this trend of unoriginality by releasing a cover album '''Garage Inc.''' (moar leik Garbage inc. amirite?) the following year. It consisted of songs by nobodies and shitty punk bands, who now make more money than they ever did playing for tips down their local titty bar because of Metallica. This is one of the few things that Metallica has ever done that has benefited ''someone else'', even if it was by using other peoples music for their own gain.

Metallica, with the ever-growing ego, decided that they needed to record a live album with the [[San Francisco]] Symphony Orchestra. They released '''[[BDSM|S&M]]''' in 1999, its tracklist was basically what the greatest hits album would look like and every old Metallifag's fears i.e. half the songs were from Load/Load II. However Metallica [[Lie|being somewhat decent]], made it a double album so there was at least one album worth of ok material, well if you [[lol wut|like heavy metal anyway]]. Another thing to note is how Metallica being the creative geniuses they were, actually believed that by throwing [[pretentious|violins, trumpets and other obsolete instruments]] into the mix of their songs, that this actually somehow made the songs superior, what Metallica more or less achieved was more analogous to some dumb [[ricer]], slapping several grands worth of bodykits onto a shitty front wheel drive compact.

===Trolling Metallica fans=== 

The trolling of a Metallica fan can be highly rewarding experience and can produce much [[lulz|lulz.]]

The following is a list of ways you may want to try:


1. Make fun of [[soulja boy|overrated]] bassist Cliff Burton's [[death|death]]

2. Say that Load and Re-load are "classic Metallica" and that they are better than Master of Puppets.

3. Say that <s>Raining Blood</s> St.Anger or anything from Load/ReLoad is your favourite song by Metallica.

4. Say that Lars Ulrich is your favourite <s>guitarist</s> drummer.

[[Image:Napsterbad.jpg|thumb|NAPSTER BAAAAAAAD!!!]]
[[Image:Napster-lars.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Needless to say [[butthurt|he chose to walk awaywith the money, rather than take any unnecessary risks.]]]]
Metallica having spent too much time [[IRL]] due to their massive wallets (hey [[basement dweller|who wouldn't]]?), neglected the internets and so when they heard their unreleased single for the [[Tom Cruise|Mission Impossible II]] soundtrack: '''[[Madeleine McCann|I Disappear]]''' on the radio, they shat bricks and were completely stumped at how their [[money|song]] could have gotten leaked. As it turns out, anyone with too much time on their hands and a triple digit IQ were using this [[P2P]] program called [[Napster]]. Basically Napster, before being raped by the music industry, let you download music for free. So, if you thought Metallica were butthurt over a single, you can only imagine the [[BAW|BAWWWWWWWWW]] at having their entire discography available for free.
Ulrich then proceeded to do what anyone with [[no life|plenty of time]] on their hands would do, he compiled a list of usernames of several hundred thousand Napster users, and like the tough guy he was, was threatening [[lawsuit]]s whenever he got any air time. [[16 year old girls]], [[13 year old boys]] and [[basement dwellers]], that downloaded their [[crap|music]] on [[Napster]] went into extreme [[butthurt]] because they were on the verge of actually having to pay for something.

Eventually Ulrich actually got bored trolling penniless children and losers, so he and <s>Metallica</s> Hetfield went and sued Napster itself for <s>great justice</s> [[money|reparations]], needless to say it was a fine example of American justice, with Metallicash winning.

===[[lie|Back To Their Roots]]===


Not long after this great publicity, Newsted left the band in 2001 due to Hetfield becoming increasingly jealous and insecure over Newsted's shitty side band that never actually took off. This event has been surrounded by controversy but most fans agree that a big reason Newsted left the band is because he was tired of having to take Kirk's dick up his ass while watching Ulrich take James's. Alas, Metallica didn't care as they never did like Newsted in the first place.

[[Image:St_Wanker.jpg|thumb|left|The cover for the album '''[[rage|St Anger]]''', was hailed with [http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/metallica/stanger much critical acclaim], proof that [[money|the media serves the interests of the public]]. ]]

So Newsted moped about in some Canadian metal band [[shit nobody cares about|Voivod]] allowing the other members to leach off his ill-gotten money. Ozzy Osbourne in need of a new bassist, took pity upon Newsted, and took him up as his bassist. However, this didn't even last a year, as Newsted ever more confused by his aspie emotions, felt that he had to leave and concentrate on playing for that obscure Canadian band.


Metallica, having generated some publicity with the loss of their bassist, decided it was the perfect time to record a new album. However many things had changed since when [[bicurious|sexually ambiguous]] alternative-rock was dominating the 90s. Nu-metal was now the choice of music for angst-ridden teens; it blended the musical qualities of [[facepalm|hip-hop and metal]]. Metallica felt now was the time to return to their roots; old Metallica fans were once again fapping upon hearing Hetfield and Ulrich, say how they were going to make the next album loud, fast, and angry again, like back in the good old days.


Metallica spent a whole year hard at work, recording this much hyped album (with producer Rock on bass), such that by the end of the process in 2003, nu-metal was almost dead. Surely, this could only be a good thing, amirite? Metallica did say they were going back to their roots after all. The music critics and the media who knew best certainly thought so too, and gave the album much [http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/metallica/stanger praise] (seriously), Metallica fans were now assured that they would not be disappointed, went out and bought '''[[Nerd Rage|St Anger]]''' by the masses, propelling this to No. 1 and multi-platinum status. However what the Metallica fans didn't realise was that in the reviews given, the album was described as [[retarded|catchy]], with plenty of [[bix nood|bass]], and [[butthurt|angst]]. Which meant Metallica thought they could jump on the nu-metal [[cash|gravy train]], and release an album full of Hetfield's incoherent shouting, Ulrich bashing on tin pots, with the treble turned off, and the bass set on 10. As if that wasn't bad enough, Metallica didn't record a single solo, further cementing the undeniable claim that 

<center><youtube>c9rzuPmqv2Q</youtube></center>
{{quote|Can I say something that I think is bullshit? This whole fucking 'solo outdates the whole thing'… that's so bullshit, you know? If you don't put a guitar solo on one of these songs, that dates it to this period, and that's cemented to a trend that's happening in music right now. I think that's stupid and I think that's totally trendy.|Hammett telling the truth, but being the most [[gay|effeminate]] member, is at the bottom of the pecking order, so was ignored as usual}}

[[Image:Metallica love.jpg|thumb|left|The recording process was very stressful]]
Metallica were a product to be sold, like condoms or cigarettes. Funnily enough this time around though, Metallica actually [[DOING IT WRONG|missed the boat]] as crappy music like [[Korn]], [[Slipknot]] and [[wigger|Limp Bizkit]] were making way for shittier acts like [[My Chemical Romance]], [[fail|Linkin Park]] and [[gay|Panic! At The Disco]]. As previously mentioned, this didn't stop the album hitting No. 1 and as though that wasn't bad enough, Metallica went on to [[wtf|win a Grammy for the title song]], further proving the superiority of our free and unabridged press to those fascists who [[censor|filter]] theirs.

[[Shit nobody cares about|On a side note]] '''Roberto Agustín Trujillo''' filled in the bassist slot, after another [[American Idol|audition]]. It's rather unfortunate for Metallica, that despite being within the same age bracket, Trujillo not only looks cooler than the other members but he also makes Metallica look a lot older by comparison. It doesn't help either when Metallica are in public they fondle and grope Trujillo, in the hope that his untainted charisma and novelty rub off onto them. Trujillo before being given the opportunity of playing in Metallica, made his fame in the [[punk]] metal band '''[[an hero|Suicidal Tendencies]]''' and was bassist in Ozzy Osbourne's band before being ironically replaced by Jason Newsted who had left Metallica.

===Back To Their Roots II===
[[Image:Metallica Death Magnetic.jpg|thumb|right|Another No. 1 album ]]
When the time came to <s>buy another fleet of Pagani Zonda</s> record another album, it was the year 2007. Thanks to the likes of [[DO NOT WANT|great]] metal bands like [[DragonForce]], [[emo|Underoath]], [[fail|Trivium]], and [[Britfag|Bullet for My Valentine]], guitar solos and heavy metal music <s>were once again socially acceptable though tainted</s> was a disappointment [[moar]] than ever.

Metallica once again were hosting press releases, making [[MOAR]] promises of <s>[[lie|going back to their roots and making another "classic" Metallica album]]</s> being as shitty as they have always been.  This had [[phail|phailed]] them time and time again as they reached a lower level of shittiness with every deep hard thrust they gave into eachothers [[anus]].

Fast forward to 2008, with much hype and media [[buttsecks|rear-ending]], the album was released. [[truth|'''Frolicking Unicorn''']] which went to No. 1 on every chart <s>worth considering as expected</s> that isn't worth reading.  [[you|Everyone]] then realized that it was the same shit they had been turning out all alone and continued to not give a shit.

[[lulz|Metallica did not take home a grammy]] and lost to [[FAIL|Coldplay for Best Rock Album of the Year]]. They were officially more [[phail]] than both [[Blink 182]] and Coldplay. After much consolation [[buttsecks]] they left with their guitars between their legs.

===Induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame===

[[Last Thursday]], Metallica, along with pioneer [[rap|rock]] band Run DMC [[shit nobody cares about|and a bunch of other bands]], were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Besides bragging to the world about how [[shit|awesome]] they are, Metallica performed three songs, including the classic [[mantrain|Train Kept a Rollin']], which featured [[over 9000]] different guest guitarists. James Hetfield's children were there as well, although Pedobear snatched them up later on. 

At their induction, Metallica said that [[Truth|the Hall of Fame is run by a bunch of pussies]] for not having more <s>good</s> bands like [[Kiss|KISS]] or [[Rush_Limbaugh|Rush]]. Of course, everyone has been saying this for years, so it's unlikely the nomination committee will listen since they're too busy bringing in bands like [[Fail|ABBA]].

Although Jason Newsted appeared, Dave Mustaine was nowhere to be found. He was invited over, but was too butthurt that Megadeth wasn't inducted to come. [[Some argue]] that he was too busy touring, or maybe he's no longer butthurt, considering that Dave became a [[christfag]] in 2004.

But its most likely because he didn't want the world to see the massive boner he would get from watching the guys that used to fuck him [[in the ass]] get a big, phallic extension to their e-penis.

===Guitar Hero===
Metallica soon realized that nobody was going to go out and buy their latest display of assmanship called [[Shit nobody cares about|Twat Magnetic]]. So [[last Thursday]], [[Guitar Hero|Guitar Hero Metallica]] was released, which featured a new [[money|double bass drum attachment]] for the drums. It sold many copies, making Metallica even more fucking rich. Metallica intends to invest the money earned on this <s>sellout</s> endeavor by partnering with local software companies to develop the next generation of P2P applications, most notably Crapster. The idea behind Crapster is to [[The Human Centipede|merge every single song ever recorded into one enormous MP3 so large that no one will be able (or willing) to download it]]. Despite the fact that the idea originated from the band itself, Lars is already extremely mad and intends to file a class action lawsuit against himself.

* Metallica ''loves'' [[cock|bacon]] (of course who doesn't?), and this is the source of a [[forced meme]] on Megadeth's forums.
* Lars has been kicked in the nuts 4,280 times.
* James has kicked Lars in the nuts 4,279 times.
* The original cover art for the Black Album was a photo of a bunch of hairy assholes, but in the end, the band opted to go with the more discreet "Don't Tread On Me" faded snake logo rather than a picture of the band.
