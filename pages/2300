=Excerpts from a recent MSN conversation with DivineAngel=
'''Cap'nChef has argued with DivineAngel on DeviantART and her own forum numerous times, and was eventually banned. He had a conversation on MSN with her where he took her side, knowing that she's too stupid to remember that he's one of the numerous people she has banned for "LULZ activity"! '''

---

'''Divine Angel says:''' Ya well jokes on them I have the abilty to miniplate people. let me tell you a little secret (this is how i make karma worse for them)

'''Divine Angel says:''' by the time they realize what I have doen it will allredy be too late

''Cap'n Chef says:'' uh oh, what are you going to do to them?

'''Divine Angel says:''' simple i use their own councious aginst them. Let them devolge in the sin they adore so much and watch them crumble.

''Cap'n Chef says:'' that'll make them feel really bad, seriously. its kinda mean, but I guess thats what they deserve, right?

'''Divine Angel says:''' I dont think minors who should never be allowed to see mature art should be allowed to say what mature is

'''Divine Angel says:''' mature should be the textbook definition

'''Divine Angel says:''' art is art

'''Divine Angel says:''' and DA has forgotten what Art is

'''Divine Angel says:''' so they need a little frendly reminder

''Cap'n Chef says:'' I totally agree! I mean, what are the creators of Deviant Art all minors? do they really need to have silly rules about sexual content? I mean they came up with those rules like 7 years ago, they'd all be little kids. its so stupid!

'''Divine Angel says:''' I can understand no explicit but my Bad Riku?

''Cap'n Chef says:'' I saw that picture! there wasn't anything bad about it! I didn't even know who they were supposed to be so how can people say that they are underage characters? I wasn't even sure what I was looking at or who they were, so how do they know those characters aren't over 18?!? they are so dumb

'''Divine Angel says:''' actualy i cleaned up the line art a bit I finaly got it looking proper and the way i intended

''Cap'n Chef says:'' but still, how do they know how old those characters were? just because the official age makes them minors doesn't mean they were in your picture. who cares what age the original creators made the characters. I didn't see them putting any new artwork on deviantart, but you did, so yours is obviously more important!

'''Divine Angel says:''' actualy throught the series they grow thrugh adolecence

'''Divine Angel says:''' in the one yet to be reliced sora is supose to be 18

''Cap'n Chef says:'' but people are just trying to degrade your work by giving opinions and arguing with you using logic! it doesn't even make sense! they are so stupid. who cares if the game isn't even out yet and the official age is underage, that has nothing to do with it because it was obvious that it had nothing to do with the original series and had to be an alternate universe since the original characters were disney characters too and we all know disney doesn't allow sexual content, so it HAD to be an alternate universe. they should stop being so dumb

'''Divine Angel says:''' to spyte their offical porn sight

---

'''A little later in the conversation, she spoke about her plan to start her own art site to destroy DeviantART. Oh noes!'''

---

'''Divine Angel says:''' but i suppose charging money would allow us to be good out of the gate

''Cap'n Chef says:'' yeah exactly!

'''Divine Angel says:''' and we dont want to crush da in an instant we want them to suffer

''Cap'n Chef says:'' and no one will mind paying $10 to sign up, they'll just know that there must be something good on the site

''Cap'n Chef says:'' kinda like batman, we'd be the joker and we'd make batman(DA) suffer with some ingenious, long convoluted plan. just so long as robin doesn't show up and save him. hate it when that happens!

---

'''Predictably, she never caught on that she was not in fact having a friendly conversation, but being milked for lulz like the lol-cow she is.'''

[15:05] theunibomber17@aim.com: So what exactly is sthis site about?

[15:05] Divine Angel: what we really needs to be done is gathering a team of people... I have a few immages but they aren few and far 
most of emeralds in their pure forum before being cut

[15:06] Divine Angel: its an art sight but since DA is all chasig off soem really good artists I want to give them a place to roam 
without fear of people like ED or getting immages removed without warings

[15:06] theunibomber17@aim.com: Ok, but what is the site? fanfiction, role playing...?

[15:07] Divine Angel: my forum is role play the sight is for alr of all types including fandom what I have donw allredy is basicly a 
skelleton but its not much i fear

[15:08] theunibomber17@aim.com: So will it be like dA with userpages and such?

[15:11] theunibomber17@aim.com: Printing is more complicated though

[15:12] theunibomber17@aim.com: You need to buy printers

[15:12] theunibomber17@aim.com: and paper

[15:13] Divine Angel: or reliy ona contract with a printing coperation, my grandfather knows someone in bay city that pwns their own

=Logs with her roommate=

'''Someone, after being blocked from posting in DivineAngel's DA page, and not being able to answer to the witty comment, decides to contact her on MSN. And he gets her "roommate" instead.'''

--

''BLAH says:''
what are "tows manners"? =D

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
excuse me, did you or did you not want to join the mailing list?

''BLAH says:''
Pssh, not my fault you decide to block me before I can give you a clever answer.

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
what?
'''
Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
hunny, I dont know what you are talking about!

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
The person that originaly made this e-mail for the mailinglist changed her address

''BLAH says:''
so, I am not talking to DivineAngel? Is that what you're saying?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
Divine went into slucusion for some benine reason, she has been in such for over a yeaar a speritual clensing

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
year*

''BLAH says:''
And no offence, but you type as horribly as she does. So, it's a bit hard to believe.

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
My home may be from america but that dosent mean i speak american


'''LOL, "american" is a language now? Further on.'''


'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
you another one of them "grammer nazis" that constantly perster people with no regard that they may b from a diffrent contry

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
be*

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
sorry keyboard got soda spilled all over it so its acting weard

''BLAH says:''
actually hon. I'm not even american or english. There.

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
than you should know not every one can speak english so well

''BLAH says:''
No. I just would find it embarrasing if I was american, and I found out 12 year old kids from Singapura writting better english than me.

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
english is not easy to do its one of the most difficult tounges

''BLAH says:''
No. Portuguese, French, Chinese, Korean and Japanese are. English is one of the easiest.

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
not true, ask your english teacher she will tell you noy eather you join mailing list (and are expectied to contribute to the newsletter) or you here to herasss someone who no longer is able to be contacted unless hte information is givin to you in person

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
now*

''BLAH says:''
harrass? Me? Oh, I feel insulted~
I wanted to talk to DivineAngel. Also, if she is in some "speritual clensing", how come she continues to answer comments in DeviantArt?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
Must be she abandion account... possibly after chat idea got taken by a dramallama, uh correct me if i get this insult wrong, Dick Weed

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
i go fix account


'''There, the reason why her roommate is currently in DA. Continuing.'''


''BLAH says:''
"Fix account"? Enlight me, please.

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
she trust someone to help prevent people form hacking accounts I one of them I no instrest in DA since I have my own webpage to host my art on

''BLAH says:''
That's new, because she keeps using that account.
Also, you have your own webpage? 

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
no she has new account she left da started joining other art pages like fanart central

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
that recent one

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
she been wondering about strange messages

''BLAH says:''
What strange messages?
Also, what's your mother language, if you don't mind me asking?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
Aribic

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
there she normaly has computers memorize other logins so she can aviod trying to memorize diffrent languidges

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
logins sorry I change it to her normal one thou it is only more likely she will not return

''BLAH says:''
she won't return because she never went away. She's still around, and speaking to people in giberish aka fictional languages.

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
out of courisoty what did you say to her?

''BLAH says:''
I said something in a real language. Just not english.

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
what did you say she may only have acess to one translator but she has friends that speak diffrent languidges

''BLAH says:''
like al bhed?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
it is an AlBhed translated straight from its sorce, it is prized creation of square enix.


'''Yes, because fictional languages are superior than anything else right? Later...'''


''BLAH says:''
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark
their runes are based in the Elder Futhark runes.

''BLAH says:''
in other words, it's just a fictional language for a videogame, it's just fantasy, doesn't make sense speaking it, instead of a much more real, ancient, and challenging language.

''BLAH says:''
and who is Haalu?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
Haalu is pencel artist, and she probably speak it because she no want ed to understand. I admit some of their articles are humerious but I no loke slandering anything it be more funny without slander

''BLAH says:''
so you speak that language, so the people from ED don't understand it?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
i tell you divine not here

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
you not listen well and im tired of writeing in tone easer to write in english with spellign errors

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
and you do have horrible maners

''BLAH says:''
No. Having horrible manners is to, for example, call you an idiot.
But I'm not doing that. Not directly, kaffir.

''BLAH says:''
And there's no point in speaking in Al Bhed because there are thousands of translators in the internet.

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
prehaps she speak in aribic than or spanish? she not good pr exact on most words but she close enough

''BLAH says:''
Oi, kaffir, she's arabic? That I didn't know.

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
ohand... Si, me abla Español


'''As I was told, "kaffir" means "nigger" in arabic. She didn't react to this. Later, BLAH manages to make her talk a bit too much.'''


'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
she speak little she know diffrent colors to an extent

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''

''BLAH says:''
So. Where's DivineAngel? Meditating under a cold waterfall?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''

''BLAH says:''

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''

''BLAH says:''
What's an "instigator"?

''BLAH says:''
Also, she's pissed? Why? I thought she was away for spiritual stuff.

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
Idiot Instigatior (person who been dragging shit on) has left his dirty laundry everywhere again

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
and bailed on rent again we warn him if he di it again we kick his ass out

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
we cant afford to have him live with us if he will not supposr him self mucher

''BLAH says:''
Who is him? DivineAngel's brother?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''

''BLAH says:''

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''

''BLAH says:''

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''

''BLAH says:''

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
very unclean

''BLAH says:''
How many are in the house?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
me, hisoka, Vincent (Vlad), Divine, and soem louser Rikky who was supose to be a lifeline but with Vlad's promotion we can kik the basterd out.

''BLAH says:''
how, you're all college students or something?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
yes

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
ivine tryingot finish culinaary school so she spending ost of ehr time in classes or praticeing what alows her to keep her anger in check

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
divine*

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
she rarely draws and like me she wants to be a coic artist speed is everythign to us

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
the faster we can make a comic the more money we can get


'''And then, the dreadful question.'''


''BLAH says:''
did she manage to sell any prints?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
quality is important too she tryingot work on bringing her speeed up to teh point of her quality

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
no prints artest sells on DA it got overrun by ed

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
they undermined the site and distroyed most of what was once there

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
it no longer what it claims

''BLAH says:''
a pity. So how can she expose her art? Does she have her website ready?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
no she too bussy with more important things

''BLAH says:''
like the spiritual stuff?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
like homework cluenary school and job hunting

''BLAH says:''
why isn't she in a art school instead? Where do you live after all?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
Txas and art may help her allot but she excels at the dieing art of Needlepoint

''BLAH says:''
oh, what is that art about?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
mostly a hobby a way to express herself withoutbeing ridiculd yet every time she tryes to earn a extra buck or two well...

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
this time they went too far

''BLAH says:''
that sounds nice. Does she sell her works then?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
thats what the site is gonna be for

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
its gonna offer the opertunity for people to open a store

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
allow them to showcase soem fandom and third party given they are actualy using the prints it might run off paypail

''BLAH says:''
oh, like deviantart?

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
no not like diviantart

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
the diffrence she offer discouragement not banishment by discourageing certin things like the use of fanart, or third party (screenshots and customizations made from clipart)

'''Ion (e'on) Fortuna says:'''
she can redce them without hurting hte artist


'''The rest of the conversation is irrelevant. However, BLAH managed to get this DA page, possibly hers: http://ladyhisoka.deviantart.com'''
