[[Image:One ugly nigger.jpg|thumb|right|400px|El Chupacabra, Oh how I <3 [[you|thee]]!]]

'''Chupacabras''' (not to be confused with [[Star Wars|Chewbaccas]]) have done everything from stealing [[you]]r [[sheep]] to having an [[buttsecks|intimate relationship]] with [[your mom]] to [[baby fuck|raping your 4 month old brother]] with a [[spoon]].

==[[WTF]] is a Chupacabra?==

[[Image:Chupacabra.jpg|thumb|right|[[X? In My Y?|Chupacabra? In MY Suitcase?]]]]

A Chupacabra is a [[furry]] from [[Mexico]] that specializes in [[suck]]ing blood out of [[animal]]s, especially [[Goatse|goats]]. No one knows what El Chupacabra looks like, but descriptions have ranged anywhere from a mix between [[Cthulhu]] and [[W|George Bush]] to a very striking resemblance of [[you]]. Unfortunately like all the [[people]] from Mexico, the Chupacabra have been illegally invading [[America]] via the trunk of a car since the [[1990s]]. Fucking <s>Mexicans</s> Chubacabra! First they take our jobs, then our [[money]], and now our [[women]]. What's next?

==Known Types of Chupacabra==

==[[Fail|Attempts at Describing a Chupacabra]]==

[[Image:Chupacabra2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pedo]] version of El Chupacabra.]]

===[[Fart]]ing Lizard===
The most common description of Chupacabra is a reptile-like being, appearing to have leathery or scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back. This form is about [[midget|3-4 feet tall]], and stands and hops in a similar fashion to a [[Australia|kangaroo]]. This variety is said to have a [[dog]] or [[A cat is fine too|panther]]-like nose and face, a forked tongue, and large fangs. [[bawwwww|It is said to hiss and screech when alarmed]], as well as leave a [[fart|sulfuric stench behind]]. [[Some argue|When it screeches, some reports note that the Chupacabra's eyes glow an unusual red, that gives the witnesses nausea. Some witnesses have reported seeing bat-like wings.]]

===[[Dog]]-Lizard===
Another description of Chupacabra, although not as common, is described as a strange breed of wild dog (i.e. what [[you]] will be eating tonight at a [[Chinese]] restaurant). This form is mostly [[bald|hairless]], has a pronounced spinal ridge, unusually pronounced eye sockets, fangs, and claws. It is claimed that this breed might be an example of a dog-like reptile. [[troll|Unlike conventional predators]], the Chupacabra is said to drain all of the [[furfag]]'s blood through a single hole or two holes made on the [[cock]].

==[[IRL]] fame==

[[Image:Chupacabra in love.JPG|thumb|right|Awww it's in [[love]]!]]

The popularity of the Chupacabras has resulted in it being [[porn|featured]] in several different ways.

===Books===
*Several [[science|scientific]] books trying to either prove or disprove their existence.

===Blogs===
*Every [[conspiracy]] [[fundie]] ever on the internet has some blog about Chupacabra.

===Movies===
*See: El Chupacabra in El [[JewTube]]. [[Fanboy]]s of El Chupacabra go [[batshit insane]] when describing the [[buttsecks|extent of their relationship]] with Chupie in their JewTubes.

===Television===
*The ''[[X-files]]'' (What hasn't been featured on this show? fucking [[Scientology|conspiracy fags]].)

==Note-worthy things Chupacabras have done==

===[[I did it for the lulz|They did it for the lulz]]===
The first reported siting of [[Mexico|border-hopping]] Chupacabra doing it for the lulz was in March 1995 in [[Puerto Rico]]. In this [[9/11|attack]], 8 [[goat]]s were discovered [[dead]] from [[vampire|being drained of blood]]. In 1975, similar [[murder|killings]] in the small town of Moca occurred; but at the time were attributed to local [[sodomite]]s. Initially it was suspected that the killings were committed by <s>a Satanic cult</s> [[Jews]], but further killings were later reported around the island, and many farms reported losses of [[over 9000]]. Each of the furries had been bled dry through a series of small circular incisions on their cocks.

===[[America]]===

*'''[[Texas]]''': Just about every [[cowboy]] has [[fellatio|blasted]] El Chupacabra in the State of Texas.

===/[[b]]/===
*Whenever there is a mention of something somewhere sucking, /[[b]]/tards cream their jeans at the thought of being sucked off by this [[ugly|lovely]] creature. As a result, El Chupie holds a dear place in the heart of the [[b|anus of the internet]]; though not quite as famous as he should be. [[You]] can help by spamming the fuck out of [http://img.4chan.org/b/imgboard.html this place] if you want Chupie to be loved even [[moar]].

===[[In Soviet Russia...|In Russia, Chupacabra suck you!]]===
*Bored of getting BJ'ed by cowfags, Chupie decided to travel to [[Russia|the Land of Opposites]]. [[It is a mystery|At this point, it is unclear how many furfag Russians have been sucked off by Chupie.]]

===[[Colombia]]===
Being a [[homo]] and a [[crack]] addict obviously go hand in hand; therefore, one would expect Chupie to show up here, [[amirite]]? [[Last Thursday|A few years ago]], a series of reports on [[cocaine|Colombian]] national news reported more than [[300]] dead [[sheep]] in the region of Boyaca, and the [[trap|capture]] of a possible Chupacabra specimen to be analyzed by [[scientists]] at the [[college|National University of Colombia]].

===[[Philippines]]===
Chupie was caught again in the [[Philippines]] sucking dick on the corner after getting his rent money ripped off by [[transvestite|Filipino hookers]]. [[some argue|Some of the residents]] believe that it was the Chupacabra that killed 8 [[prostatot|budding Filipino hookers]] after being scammed out of his rent for a second time. [[pimp|The owner of the skilled Lolis]] reported that he saw a dog-like furry ass-[[pwning]] his property.

[[Image:Chupacabra description.jpg|thumb|right|How [[spider expert|experts]] view El Chupacabra.]]
In an attempt to [[delete fucking everything|deny]] the existence of the [[awesome]]ness that is Chupacabra, the [[liberal media]] has tried to pass of El Chupie as akin to [[Bigfoot]] or the [[Applemilk1988|Lochness Monster]]. What [[Bitches don't know]] about is that Chupie is real, and will assrape anyone who says anything to the contrary. If Chupie wasn't real, [http://shop.cafepress.com/chupacabra?cmp=KNC-G-EN-SCI&ovchn=GGL&ovcpn=Fantasy+and+Sci-Fi+Basic&ovcrn=sr2EN1go10687sb4387pi13ai1633+chupacabra+tshirt&ovtac=PPC&sr=sr2EN1go10687sb4387pi13ai1633 why does he have his own tshirts?].
