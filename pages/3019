Fop

An old-fashioned insult, a fop is a stock character who occasionally appears in [[fiction]] or at fashion shows. He makes a habit of fastidiously overdressing and putting on airs, aspiring to be viewed as an aristocrat. With long hair, ruffled lace, and lisps, many fops seem to be [[gay]] but gayness is not required. Many fops have also been famous seducers because women love it when they can borrow lipstick from their lover.

**"[Dueling] wasn't outlined in law as 'legal' but it wasn't specified as illegal either not until [[French]] banned it during the age of the Fop, because too many Fops were getting killed. IIRC it was around 1750-70? Before then, it was common knowledge that sometimes a jackass really and truly did deserve to [[die]]."
