[[Original Content|Originally]] a [[condescension|condescending]] term used to mean "people." it is now used in a positive or neutral way by [[16 year old girls]].  Faced by the [[Teenspot|constantly scrolling text of colorful doom]], the average [[16 year old girl]] will respond by shortening their text as much as possible, substituting "people" with "ppl".  This may become extremely annoying, as the average [[16 year old girl]]'s banter is comprised primarily of how "ppl" [[Shit nobody cares about|did her wrong in some way]], or how some "ppl" [[Rape|grabbed her ass]], or how "ppl" are gossiping about her [[fat]], [[Pregnant|preggy]] ass.  Anyone who uses "ppl" [[IRL]] should be immediately [[Falcon Punch|punched]] in the [[cunt]], or castrated and punched in their [[Transgender|newly-created cunt]] [[fag|if they are male.]]
