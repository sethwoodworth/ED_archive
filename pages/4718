Lady Sovereign
[[Image:Lady-sovereign22.jpg|thumb|I'd still hit it.]]

'''Lady Sovereign''' (aka ''Louise Harman'') specialises in electro hip hop. She is another example of the current trend in popular music using the word ''[[Lady GaGa|Lady]]'' in their stage name. 

== A History of Sovereign ==

[[Image:Jigsaw_7.jpg|thumb|left|Notice the disgusting oily skin]]

As one can imagine with any [[AIDS|STI]] infected mistake originating from England's urban wasteland, she was influenced musically by terrible [[America|American]] RnB artists from the early 90's, such as [[Fresh Prince|Salt-n-Pepper]]. Once she reached the [[Rape|ripe]] age for tappin' [[Dat Ass|dat loli ass]], '''14''', Sovereign began to write her own raps, in the style of [[Terrorist|Ms. Dyamite]], a [[Rap|hip hop]] artist who released the track ''Boooo!'' in the early Naughties.

Lady Sovereign herself is [[chav]], townie scum aged to a [[Cheese|crisp, mature taste]] over the course of 25 years. After releasing her first few singles and EP's, she became a [[OH WOW|respected member]] of the UK [[Rap|Grime]] scene. The Grime scene is [[Penis|male]] dominated, which proves Sovereign's [[whore]] status, for the people involved in this sort of shit are your typical chav gutterscum, whose only redeeming feature is the way that they [[Kitchen|treat]] women. 

Sovereign's early music is [[Shit|typical of UK Grime]]: Some disgusting [[bitch]] spitting shit about [[Fellatio|sucking dick]] and fucking guys for [[Drug|drugs]], whilst still [[No|''"attending"'']] [[Special|high]] school totally fucked up on [[meth]]. But even this is preferable to her most recent album, ''Jigsaw'', which is another entry into the [[Rape|skull fucking]], over populated, [[Cum|semen]] soaked and [[shit]] plastered '''Popular Dance''' market. Upon joining the likes of [[Lady GaGa]] and [[Katy Perry|Katy Perry]] she has automatically lost all the street credit she has amassed over the years in Grime. 

But it's all [[Money|worth it]].

She currently resides in London, snorting coke and sucking cock.

As you can see, she is clearly living rough, risking her life to street crime [[bullshit|everyday]]. Barely fuckin surviving bruv'

== A Random Night with Sovereign ==

[[Image:Catpeope.jpg|thumb|center|800px|Notice the Fear in Sovereign's eyes]]

<br>

Back in 2006, a [[fantard]] from [[Gay|San Francisco]] embarked on a mission to have a [[Rape|"random"]] night with Lady Sovereign. 
His name was Zach [[Slowpoke|Slow]] and his original message was as follows:

{{quote|I really want to meet and party with Lady Sovereign after she performs in my hometown of San Francisco on June 9th, 2006. I want you guys to decide what we do on our night out together--so to make the night more fun, I'll only be spending money on her that you guys donate to this project.|Zack Slow}}

Slow also planned on raising [[Over 9000|$10,000]] dollars to spend on his random night out with Sovereign. Slow claimed this money was to buy the things that Sovereign is [[Hookers and Blow|used too]]. 

===Andrew Bancroft===

The ''Random Night with Sovereign'' was promoted at local shows by MC's, but none more-so than Andrew Bancroft, a local MC known as "Jelly Donut". There was a bit of [[Lulz|drama]] caused when Bancroft attended a Lady Sovereign show in January, 2007 dressed as a donut, where he attempted to disrupt the show. Mild lulz were observed when Sovereign threw a drink at Bancroft and spat on him. He was escorted out of the venue by [[FBI|security]].

===Creepy Response===

The first thing that comes to mind when reading something like this is, ''what a fucking [[stalker]]''. [[You Win the Prize|10 points for noticing]]! This is extreme stalker activity, and this man should be treated as such, and [http://www.helpmegetrandomwithladysovereign.com/contact/index.html reminded of the fact well into the future]. When asked if he is a stalker, he responded with the following bullshit:

{{quote|The short answer is "[[Lie|absolutely not]]!"
<br>
The [[TL;DR|long]] answer is: As I was walking home tonight to start working on this site, I passed by a traveling [[Gypsy|tarot card reader]] ([[Cool|true]] story). Jew for a card reading, so I [[Rape|couldn't]] [[Gypsy|say no]]. She told me to ask her any question, so I asked "am I a stalker?" She then flipped over a card that said "[[Truth|the Pope]]" on it. I'm not sure what that means, but I don't think [[Unfunny|the Pope ever stalked anyone]].|Zack the Stalker}}

===Success===

A month later, the [[Internet]] proved that it is populated with complete fucking morons with way too much money to throw about. Zack Slow not only raised the $10,000 he asked for, '''but he also got the date with Sovereign'''. Some may call this a victory for the little guy, but in all truthfulness it is merely a confirmation of the idiocy of [[America|Americunts]] and their easily opened, bulging fucking wallets.

== She Kissed a Girl ==

[[Image:Lady sovereign katy perry groping perez hilton 300x400 270409 .jpg|thumb|Disregard the faggot who owns the watermark on this photo]]

Back in April, 2009, Lady Sovereign and [[Katy Perry|Katy Perry]] were reported to have locked themselves in a bathroom at a party. When Sovereign was asked what they were doing in there, she replied with, ''"naughty things"''. [[Hawt|Insta-boner]]. This author can only hope that both Perry and Sovereign got it on and took pictures. 

However, this isn't the first time that it was reported that Sovereign and Perry had been fucking around naked. And by the sounds of some of the shit that goes on amongst 20-something celebrities, it isn't that hard to believe.

During an interview about a party that Katy Perry was hosting Sovereign was quoted by HotHits.com saying:

{{quote|At one of her afterparties she put her pyjamas on and I don't think she was wearing anything underneath. (It) was like a long t-shirt kind of thing|Lady Sovereign}}

When she was asked why the fuck Katy Perry, a known [[Christfag]] would be at a party with nothing but a t-shirt on, she said:

{{quote|It was out of control. Just a thing in her hotel room, but yeah I saw [[Cunt|something]] I shouldn't have seen.|Lady Sovereign}}

== Arrested in [[Brisbane]] ==

[[Image:Sovbeatstrannies.jpg|thumb|WHICH WUN OF YOO FOOKIN' TRANNIES IS NEXT, YEAH?]]

[[Image:Thebeat.jpg|thumb|left|Where it all [[Fellatio|went down]]]]

Recently, after playing the '''Parklife''' festival in [[Brisbane]] City, Australia, ''Lady Sovereign'' fancied a night out in the infamous Fortitude Valley. She was drinking in Brisbanes biggest gay bar, ''The Beat''. The Beat is notorious for [[Gay|queens, faggots and other nightlurking scum]], but it would seem that Sovereign had no idea, because she was rather surprised when she was punched in the face by a transvestite in the female toilets of ''The Beat''.

The attack from the [[Lady GaGa|tranny]] was completely unprovoked, further supporting the fact that these closeted faggots should be sterilised on sight. Soon after the attack, a small fight broke out, and Soverign was dragged out of the bathroom and ejected from the club, but as she was being escorted out of the club, she spat in the face of a bouncer, and was arrested by police on assault charges.

On Saturday morning she appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates Court and, even though she was struggling to stay awake, was fined $400 and ordered to pay $200 to the bouncer she spat on. 

The organisers of '''Parklife''', which still had many Australian cities to travel, where quoted as being ''happy'' that their star act was released from Brisbanes Roma St. lockup, which is notorious for drunks, junkies and the homeless, all of whom aren't too accomodating of [[Britfag|Britfags]], however [[Black|ghetto]] they may be.

Apparently the people of Brisbane wont make way for the S - O - V!

== [[Lady GaGa]] Vs. Lady Sovereign ==

[[Image:Sovereign gaga.0.0.0x0.400x292.jpeg|thumb|''GaGa'' used '''Inane Bullshit'''! Its super effective!]]
[[Image:Tn New York 3.jpg|thumb|Sovereign, proving that chavs cant fight without a bottle of Stella]]
[[Image:Sovgwenakon.jpg|thumb|Lady Sovereign's got Black-Up]]

Over the ages, the most elite warriors and superheroes have been theoretically pitted against each other in the ultimate battle for supremacy. From [[Halo|Master Chief]] and [[Half-Life|Gordon Freeman]], [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] to [[Chris-Chan]] and [[Spax3]], people have discussed and argued over these battles of the titans, and who would win them. But none have been as [[epic]], as destructive and as useless as the battle of [[Longcat|GaGa]] and [[Tacgnol|Sovereign]].

So who would win in the street fight between GaGa and Sovereign? Lets break it down:

===Prior Training===

'''Sovereign''': Grew up in a [[lie|poor]] English [[poor|housing estate]] and attended a Public School, which gave her a keen street mind, meaning she can probably [[blowjob|suck a great dick]]. She also has had some experience fighting transvesties in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. (She got smacked in the face, and complained to the bouncer, who promptly told her to [[GTFO]])

'''GaGa''': Grew up in upmarket [[New York]] and attended ''Convent of the Sacred Heart'' and ''NYU''.

:* +1 to ''Sovereign'' for being a British scumbag [[whore]], who would have had to <s>fight</s> [[blowjob|suck nigger cock]] to stay alive on the streets of London.

===Battle Attire===

'''Sovereign''': Dresses in the threads common to [[Chav]] scum from her region. Think ''M.I.A.'' or that sort of ilk.

'''GaGa''': Dresses like a [[Trap|transvestite]].

:* +1 to ''Sovereign'' for wearing clothes suitable to fight in, however, +0.5 to ''GaGa'', because she seems like she might be able to swing about a six inch heel with devastating effect.

===Alliances===

'''Sovereign''': Keeps company with rapper [[Jay-z]] who signed her to her current label. Also, Sovereign toured with [[Whore|Gwen Stefani]].

'''GaGa''': Keepz it REEL with [[Faggot|Colby O'Donis]].

:* +1 to ''Sovereign'' again, for keeping company with people who own guns.

===Fierce Warrior Haircut===

'''Sovereign''': [[Lily Allen]]esque Blunt Cut.

'''GaGa''': [[Lily Allen]]esque Blunt Cut.

:* -1 point to both.

===Lovecraftian Horror Trait===

[[Image:CthulhuGaga.jpg|thumb]]

'''Sovereign''': Lacks the sanity to gaze upon Great Cthulhu

'''Lady GaGa''': Looks, acts and flashes her crotch like Cthulhu.

===The Winner Is===

:*'''Lady Gaga''', sorted.

'''Explanation?'''

[[Truth|Lady GaGa needs to do nothing, as Lady Sovereign's sanity would shred upon seeing her]]. This is mostly due to the fact that Lady GaGa bears an uncanny resemblance to the Great Old One, and by Lovecraftian rules Lady Sovereign's sanity would be erased by seeing such an androgenic hybrid of man and squid-woman.
