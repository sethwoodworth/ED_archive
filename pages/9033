'''Wikia Search''' isn't anything but a failed [[dream]] anymore, but when it was something long ago in [[2008]], it was [[Jimbo Wales]]' mindchild and his only hope of breaking [[Google]]'s grip over the [[search engine]] industry. Marketed as an [[FLOSS|open and transparent search engine]], [[Wikia]] was hoping to combine search engines and [[wiki]] physics in order to [[Vandalism|build something better and more reliable]].

==Concept==
{{Quote|The idea that Google has some edge because they've got super-duper rocket scientists may be a little antiquated now.|How little do you know, Jimbo?}}

[[File:WikiaSearch2.png|thumb|Wikia Search.]]

Wikia Search was built on four basic principles:

#Transparency &ndash; [[Richard Stallman|Because free software is better than proprietorial software, right?]]
#Community &ndash; [[Wikipedia|Because the common people know better than paid experts]].
#Quality &ndash; [[Vandalism|You can edit the search results]].
#Privacy &ndash; [[Web 2.0|Let's add social networking features so you can share your photos and dox]].

In a nutshell, Wikia Search was centered around crowdsourcing, which is the idea that the [[Lie|profit motive doesn't accomplish anything of quality]]. A notable example of crowdsourcing is [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], where anyone can write a shitty [[person article]] on their ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend and [[USI|show off]] that article to their [[Twitter]] friends.

==History==

An alpha version of the search engine was released to the public on January 7, 2008, but everyone was in agreement about the magnitudes of [[fail]] generated by this half-baked product. The alpha version was released on June 3, 2008, with [[moot]] improvement. The search engine never entered left the alpha phrase, and on March 31, 2009, Jimbo Wales admitted defeat and announced Wikia Search's closure in the near-future. On May 14, 2009, Wikia Search was finally closed and its domain was redirected to Wikianswers ([[not to be confused with]] [[WikiAnswers]]).

==Reception==
[[Thekosher]]'s reaction to Wikia Search's demise ([http://news.cnet.com/8618-17939_109-10207896.html?communityId=2008&targetCommunityId=2008&blogId=2&messageId=7748350]):

<p>Har-dee-har-har! So, that means my site, MyWikiBiz.com -- which Jimmy Wales called "antithetical" to Wikipedia's mission, and which he vowed he'd bad-mouth wherever he saw fit -- and which garnered 25% more unique visitors per month this quarter than did Wikia Search -- has now outlasted not one (OpenServing.com), but TWO failed Jimmy Wales projects since it went live in mid-2006.</p>

<p>Note, my site costs me about $20 a month to run. What seems to be the difficulty with Jimbo's wikis?</p>

Of course, Thekosher didn't believe that one comment was enough, so he made a second one [[ftw]] ([http://news.cnet.com/8618-17939_109-10207896.html?communityId=2008&targetCommunityId=2008&blogId=2&messageId=7750929]):

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">
<p>Strange. I said from Day One that Wikia Search would not work, because its leader isn't reliable and transparent.</p>

<p>In fact, my letter to the editor of Fast Company appeared in the second issue after the "Google Killer" claptrap cover story.</p>

<p>I got called a "troll", for being right. Once again.</p>

<p>Maybe people will start listening to me now?</p>

There is more criticism of Wikia Search elsewhere, but ED can't discuss them all here; try to [[Just google it|Goolge them]] instead.
