'''Sport''' is [[Fat|the terrifying and pointless act of exercising by choice]].

Something that [[you]] will never be good at, sport was the most popular, and often homosexual form of entertainment before the [[internet]] came along. [[fanboys|Barbaric tribes]] would select an [[jock|alpha male]], or a team of alpha males, that would compete against other tribes for [[money]], [[popular|fame]] and [[sex]]. In these modern and civilized times, sports are generally seen as a [[republican|grouping of conservative retards]] by its [[anonymous|superiors]]. Every four years The tards have a mega-gathering that is far larger and even more retarded then a nerd gathering. It is known as the [[Olympics]].

== History ==

Sport was invented [[at least 100]] years ago by a small group of [[Greek]] [[jocks]] (the first frat boys).  [[Fact|They competed nude and greased down with olive oil, and some learned to protect their balls by learning to pull them up into their bodies.]] The hobby quickly rose in popularity after the [[Jock]]s combined their tiny brains to create an ingenious [[advertising]] technique. They immediately began calling everyone who doesn't play sports a [[fag]] and promptly beat the [[shit]] out of them.

Many of the sports that were invented were either re-hashes of children's games, or based on pointless "skills" which can never be applied anywhere else in life. One suck example is [[Basketball]], where "let's see if I can get this paper ball in the trash from here" snowballed into a big nigger-fest. However, these "skills" are said to be desirable to females, who believe that swing a bat is "[[THE BEST]]".
