Alignment
[[Image:Alignment.jpg|thumb|left|Reference sheet.]]
Alignment is an offshoot of the [[Demotivators]] meme. An Alignment picture consists of the following:

*A picture of a real or fictional person
*A main caption stating their alignment from the [[Dungeons & Dragons]] rules; to wit, Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, Lawful Evil, Neutral Good, True Neutral, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Good, Chaotic Neutral or Chaotic Evil.
*A pithy subcaption putting forth your reasoning like a gentleman.

The average Alignment thread on [[b|/b/]] runs as follows:

'''STEP 1:''' A few funny pictures of Jack Nicholson.
'''STEP 2:''' The same goddamn pictures of Pope Benedict and House.
'''STEP 3:''' Thread implodes because nobody can agree on [[Batman]]'s alignment.

The sheer amount of faggotry piling up around this sequence has led many to proclaim "Batman" to be an alignment in itself, with such subcategories as Lawful Batman, Chaotic Batman and Batman Batman.
