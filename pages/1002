Biting Beaver/forest
An excerpt from [[BitingBeaver]]s [[DO NOT WANT|enthralling and captivating writings]].

{{Quote|This Saturday I went to the park. I got there rather late, around 8:00 pm and, since I knew I would most likely be there after the sun went down, I brought a flashlight. I walked and I sat and I thought and I walked some more. I had some wonderful encounters with local wildlife, eventually though the sun did set and I found myself in a rapidly darkening forest. As the last bits of daylight blinked out of existence the ‘night shift’ came onto duty. 

In conditions that would likely have terrified most [[rapists|men]], almost absolute blindness, dark shapes of animals staying just outside the area of my sight, the sounds of a rather large pack of coyotes coming closer, I sat down. I sat, in the middle of this space and I felt more at ease and more at home and confident than I ever feel at the store or in public. 

The darkness wasn’t scary. The animals weren’t scary. The fact that I couldn’t see wasn’t scary. I sat there for a good long time and then something occured to me. The park closes at dusk, but I was aware that the gates are rarely closed and that forestry people rarely come to this place. However, I was certain that [[rapists|men]] came here to drink, I had seen the evidence of this several times in the form of beer bottles and headlights at night. 

[[rapists|Men]] occasionally come to the park after hours. [[rapists|Men]] who likely travelled with other [[rapists|men]]. Perhaps they were teenagers, not yet 21 but sure as hell in a grown [[rapist|male]] body. 

My blood ran cold in my veins. I fumbled immediately for my [[queef|fanny]] pack and my flashlight and then I paused and decided that a flashlight would sure as hell let any [[rapist|man]] know precisely where I was. 

In a secluded forest, a place that has always been a sort of chapel to me, a place where I slip off the well worn trail and meditate for hours in the darkening forest I was scared. I was terrified because I know what [[rapists|men]] are like. I know through many painful encounters that a [[cunt|woman]], in the middle of a forest, with no ability to defend herself, at night, is a target. 

The coyotes closing in around me brought smiles to my lips and a sense of wonder and childlike safety and good humor. The thought of a group of young [[rapists|men]] sneaking into the park after hours to drink a stolen or illegally bought 6 pack of beer was '''bone chilling.''' 

It occured to me then that there is no animal on this proud planet that is more dangerous to a lone woman than a [[rapist|man]]. 

I scurried out of the park, thinking all the while about [[rapist|male]] hunters in the woods trying to poach the wildlife and what [[rape|could possibly happen]] to me if they came upon me out there, defenseless. 

It also occured to me that there is no place on this planet where I can go to feel safe from [[rapists|men]]. No place where my autonomy and [[cunt|body]] isn’t threatened, even if my actual chances of being harmed by a strange [[rapist|man]] in the woods are remote, I have FELT [[rapist|male]] violence my whole life and my head remembers it very clearly. 

[[Victim|This]] is what [[rapists|men]] have made of me. Of my life and my existence. And even in places where we feel we are safe, the internet, a remote forest, we are reminded, violently if necessary, that we will never be far enough out of the way. We will never be able to put enough distance between [[feminazi|us]] and [[anonymous|them]], they will find us and remind us that they will [[raep|violate]] us if given half the chance. 

Until last weekend I would occasionally go to the park at dusk. After recalling and remembering that no place is actually safe, I will probably not be doing that again. 

Chalk up yet another [[Rape|win]] for the terrorism of [[anonymous|man]].|[http://womensspace.wordpress.com/2007/08/06/blogging-while-female-men-win-hacking-as-sexual-terrorism/#comment-47214 BitingBeaver]}}

[[TL;DR]]: [[BitingBeaver]] is fearful more of a man drinking a [[Alcohol|forty]] he obviously [[looting|bought]] than of a [[bear]] ripping her apart limb from limb before violating her lifeless body with some big bear cock.
