Xbakkari
[http://xbakkari.deviantart.com/ Xbakkari], also known as [http://nuclearchild.deviantart.com/ Nuclearchild] and [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/toulouse/ Toulouse], is a prepubescent-looking furfag that enjoys making a lolcow out of herself with loads of faggotry and continous journal rantings. Also remember she is [[lie|NOT a wolf artist]], simply because she doesn't draw anything [[furry]] at all. Of course, this is [[srs]] [[nice try|bullshit]], and shows exactly how low her IQ of the [[internets]] really is.

Known IRL as Taina [[goatse|Colon]] (lol wut) she's a [[butthurt|self-obsessed emofag]] who complains about her [[rape|daddy a lot and her life in general]], while sodomizing herself with her Halo 3 video games until she looks like [[goatse]]. She trys to dig out as much sympathy from people as possible and [[shit bricks|shits bricks]] all over them later on. She mostly does this to her fans rather than to her friends, which is a bit depressing because her fans kiss her furry ass more than her friends ever will. Xba is known to be a [[dumbass|tard]] with an oversized ego who really needs to get the fuck over herself.

==Criticism==
LOL, WUT? Nope. Never makes any mistakes on her art, no matter how much time she claimed she put into it or claims how "original" it is. If you dare constructively critique her works of artz she will claim it's just her "style" and the way she horribly colors and draws out her fuck-ugly anatomy. Continue and she'll curl up into a moping ball and spread her furry haet through journal entries, fans and art because this is clearly all she is capable of. Since she's so used to being smothered and raepd by comments full of crap and fail, like most tartlets are, she looks down upon anyone even trying to help her a bit to improve in her art, and it probably would've been a lot less retarded if she actually stopped obsessing over her stupidity and took [[art]] MOAR srsly.

[[Image:Xba loves critique.jpg|thumb|left|LOL IT'S JUST MAH STYLE U GUYZ.]]

==Fantards==
No matter how much lulz she starts, or how many times she shits all over her fans, they will continue to flatter her, praise her, and rape her with comments, watches and favs. Most of them are emotionally unstable [[16-year-old girl|16-year-old girls]], or just your fellow emo kids who [[gay|puke and bleed rainbows]]. Many of them will forget about their current lives and die hard trying to earn her respect, appreciation, and luv. However, 99.9% of the time they [[fail]], and she will lol until they decide life is as pointless as themselves and become [[an hero]]. Pity.

Xba has a circle of lolis that are stuck to her ass from [[Neopets|Neofags]] to [[deviantART|deviantCRAP]]. They [[lurk moar]] on the internets for similar-looking ZOMGCOPYRIGHTED pieces of art that even slightly represents Xbuh's to keep her style ALIVE.

[[Image:Xba fantards.jpg|thumb|Even her emotionally unstable fantards try to earn her respect by trying to defend her in most drama cases.]]

==Lol, Art?==
She claims her art is 100% original and and believes anything "inspired" by another work is copying, which of course, is a big fucking lol. Fuck you. Her art is 100% original and you know it. Even art that is inspired by another artist is fucking copyrighted. Gtfo.

Although her [[fursona|furfag self]] is a semi-unique species, it's still 100% red fox with bat wings like 95% of all fursonas.

If you have a character even A BIT similar to any of hers (do this for the lulz anyways), she will throw a fit and get out her [[hugbox]], posting [[over 9000|over 9,000]]  journal entries about how much she hates you and will draw haet artz. Not to mention her fantard soldiers will assrape you with faggotry. Not only will she make a [[lolcow]] of herself, but she'll also accuse you of being jealous of her so called "talent" and "popularity." As if she couldn't get anymoar retarted, she made a journal entry once stating that she only goes on [[Furcadia]] now to supposedly catch art thieves and not show off her furfaggotry like she always does.

She also mocks and gloats at people who supposedly aren't up to her standards in art. If anyone questions her about art requests, trades or commissions on her front page, she'll simply hide the comment and put on an egotastic mood (unless you're [[shit|an talented artist]].

Xba, although not admitting to it, has a secret [[Nazis|Nazi]] fetish. She has made [[at least 100]] journal entries stating she haets them and does not support them, yet has a furry Nazi character. Xba's ignorance also forces her to believe that Rammstein is a Nazi band. Even if people try to knock some logic into her, she will ignore them and post even moar lulz in her journal, stating that she "doesn't care what they think." Funny. She also believes that people rip off her characters, and suffers from severe [[retard|paranoia]], as stated above. Note that she's made a big fucking deal with these people on deviantART before:
