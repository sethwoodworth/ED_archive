TL;DW
A phrase coined by Stephen King's epic movie ''The Stand'', '''TL;DW''' Stands for "too long; didn't watch" and sums up [[at least 100%]] of videos posted on on [[livevideo]] and [[YouTube]]. 

===Example:===
A spectacularly boring film about how [[Creationism|dinosaurs fit into religion.]] A typical Christian rambling a bunch of bull that [[Shit nobody cares about|no one gives a shit about.]]

<del>The video is actually quite lulz worthy until you get bored of it. He says "pornographic" instead of "geographic" at the beginning.</del> Actually he meant to say pornographic; it's his Christian Conservative Family Approved way of saying that National Geographic is hideously [[Boobs|immoral]]. (Dinosaurs + Crationism = [[EPIN]])

<center>Atheists are just as bad, as seen from this video created by a [[Theamazingatheist|Neckbearded Sasquatch.]] Note the [[ironic]] title.</center>
