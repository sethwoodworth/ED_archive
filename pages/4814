Lesbian Two Degrees of Separation
[[Image:Lesbotrain.jpg|thumb|right|Example of distance of Separation.]]

'''Lesbian Two Degrees of Separation''' is a theory built upon the observation that every [[lesbian]] in a given community has dated every other lesbian's ex-girlfriend. 

As only about 1% of the population is genuinely [[lesbian]], each individual community is so small that it becomes impossible to date someone that one of your friends/ex [[girlfriend]]s etc. haven't already dated. This makes planning any function involving three or more lesbians a bit like that puzzle with the bag of grain, the fox, and the chicken. If you don't understand why, please see [[Lesbian Break-Up]].
