1772 Society
=='''The 1772 Society'''==

The '''1772 Society''' is a [[Rhode Island]]-based political club for [[fags|those that believe in the ideas of the forefathers of America]], created by [[Justin Catalano]]. The society was created in a [[trying too hard|pathetic]] attempt to recreate the [[politics]] of [[Before the internets|yesteryear]]. They are so involved in [[Republican]] politics (although they [http://www.1772society.org/about.html deny affiliation with any party] ) that they created this "society" which is just a group of [[Children|kids]] trying to look important.

The 1772 Society is touted as a way of [[life]], to bring back the "classic [[liberal]] politics". These guys think they are fucking [[DDR|revolutionaries]] come to fight the [[Jews]]. They are 20-somethings who need résumé fodder to get an [[shit|amazing]] public servant job. Unfortunately for them, their club is full of ideas that are either too old to ever be accepted anymore, or already in the [[Jewnited States of Americunts|United States]] Constitution.  Just because something is old, doesn't make it seem like you are a badass for starting a club about it.

[[Image:jcatalano_slut.jpg|thumb|right|Totally "ultra-conservative", your sister Courtney is a model citizen. We're sure your Founding Fathers also [[Party Hard|partied hard]] like college kids and got [[drunk]]. We hope you never get elected because of these photos.]]

==Hypocrisy of the 1772 Society==

The members of the 1772 society claim to be well-versed in politics. [[Justin Catalano]], the "founder" of this society, is the biggest hypocrite of them all. Despite his claims of being a very [[conservative]] republican, he is just like any other binge drinking, [[Rape|premarital sex]], "sister is a [[slut]]" [[college]] kid. The "society" has the audacity to call themselves the "[[Terrorist|True Born Sons of Liberty]]" Catalano isn't even a true Rhode Islander was born in [[California]]. Apparently, the [[Americunts|American]] Founding Fathers also [[Basement dweller|lived out of their parents house]], worked at Stop and Shop for a year as a bagger, and had [[skank]]y [[Dear Sister|sisters]].

==Members of the 1772 Society==

The members of the 1772 Society consist mainly of Justin's [[friend]]s...the ones [[crazy]] enough to follow him or [[retard]]ed enough to not do anything on their own. While claiming to be "true sons of liberty", one such Society member Matthew Camp posted this [[comment]] on one of Justin's posted pictures on [[Facebook]]. It shows the [[Truth|true]] meaning of <s>[[tolerance]], [[freedom]] and liberty</s> [[France|liberty, equality and fraternity]].

==Connection to [[Ryan Bilodeau]]==

[[Ryan Bilodeau]] is another Republican [[fag]]got that was the head of the URI GOP. Justin has since taken his place as the leader of that group. Justin, being friends with Ryan, is just as much of a faggot as Ryan. Justin, like Ryan, claims to be "ultra conservative" however in the end is just another liberal at heart, drunken crazy college stooge. Dressing up in ties and jackets, writing fake colonial-era play documents does not make you a son of the [[revolution]]. Sorry Justin, you are just a [[Nice try|fake]].

==The Notebook==

This kid actually went out and got a notebook. He had a "ceremony" where they drafted founding documents...in a marble notebook. He even did his own calligraphy.  This is truly the future historical document that over which flocks of young children will clamor, middle-aged men will swell with pride, and young citizens will fight wars. This sacred notebook of [[dream]]s will certainly be admired for all future citizens.
