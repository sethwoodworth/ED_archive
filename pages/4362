'''Joey Boots''' is a [[fat]], [[asshole]], [[faggot]], [[IRL troll]] from [[New York City]], [[New York]].  He is best known as the [[douchebag]] regular guest of [[Howard Stern]] for the [[Last Thursday|past 10+ years]] who trolls live news reports around NYC by jumping in front of the camera and yelling, "[[Gay|BABA BOOEY BABA BOOEY HOWARD STERN'S PENIS!!!]]"  When he's not pissing off the NYC television stations, he walks around the city pissing off tourists and residents by turning on his Flip camcorder and being condescending to them.  [[Some argue]] that he is a modern day [[Andy Kaufman]].

==Family Guy Rips Him Off Too==
To [[no one]]'s surprise, [[Family Guy]] pays tribute to Joey by having Peter say his catchphrase [[wrong]] in the most [[unfunny]] way possible.<br>

==You Fucking [[White Knight|Goober!]]==

On August 25, 2010, Joey uploaded a video of him being a [[pervert]] to a [[16 year old girls|17 year old girl]] in the middle of a [[Porn|photo shoot]] at Times Square.  For some reason, strangers started getting offended at Joey filming in public and decided to get in his face to try and stop him.  What these [[idiots]] failed to realize is that Joey is a huge faggot and couldn't care less about girls' asses, much less [[Pedo|underage]] ones.  In reality, he's just a [[sick fuck]] who enjoys altercations with strangers and, most importantly, did it all for the [[lulz]].

Unfortunately, this led to more trolls flagging that video over and over again until YouTube finally decided to ban his original account, [http://www.youtube.com/user/JoeyBoots JoeyBoots].  He easily made a new one, adding "NYC" to the end of his name, and uploaded some of his old videos that are not as lulzy to avoid being banned again.
