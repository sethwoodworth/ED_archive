'''BRBFBI''' is a meme that originated from [[srs]] [[hackers]] who were busted during a [[faggotry|LAN party]].  They all were killed by a rock slide.  However, their phrase of choice lives on.  It is the phrase of choice that you say when the [[FBI|feds]] do elite IP tracing and come to arrest you for downloading [[pedophilia|kiddie pr0n]] and [[communism|music]] off the [[internets|intertubes]]. They then [[rape|interrogate]] you and take you to the pokey where you get [[buttsecks|loved]]. 

This phrase is frequently heard during the ensuing [[lulz]] and [[drama]] of an alleged [[chan]] [[partyvan|raid]].

==Proper Usage of 'BRBFBI'==
When uttering the phrase, [[all caps]] is necessary.  Otherwise, the [[lulz]] of the phrase is lost, and you must get [[raped]].  A less funny version, "BRBFEDS," may be used as well, however the true inner meaning might be lost.
