Fuzzy mazza
[[Image:Roger.jpg|thumb|Is fuzzy_mazza a man or a woman? One thing's for sure; she's a helluva [[dyke]].]]

[[Image:Sab.JPG|thumb|fuzzy_mazza, or "Roger", is also speculated to be [[Ben Vodden]]'s long lost brother/sister. Hopefully he/she follows in Ben's footsteps. ]]

Fuzzy_mazza (a.k.a furry merkin) is a  [[ftm|gender-confused]] batshit crazy [[lesbian]] rapist and [[internet stalker]]. He/she/it scopes out potential victims on the [[internets]] via lesbo dating site [http://www.gaydargirls.com GaydarGirls.com] and has been spotted over at [[LiveJournal]] on occasion.

==Is it Male or Female?==
It is understandable that, as a [[woman]], fuzzy_mazza has a tenuous grip on reality at best. It is also understandable  that, as a woman, fuzzy_mazza should hate all women and envision herself as a [[man]]. As such, she's more than qualified to become a [[Wikipedia]] admin.

So despite her [[vagina|vag]], fuzzy_mazza, decided that she was a man and that her name was Roger. Which [[lies|meant she was straight]]. But post on GaydarGirls she still did.

fuzzy_mazza eventually realized that being an ugly, friendless [[psycho]] bitch is better than being a [[cock]]less he-she man thing, and decided it was a woman again after little more than half a year of pretending to be a 'man'.

==Lesbian Rape you Say?==
Lamb101 was a [[bisexual|sometimes-lesbian]] and fellow GaydarGirls [[luser]] guilty of the insane and horrifying act of craving fuzzy_mazza's hatchet-wound [[cunt]]. Yes, there are still people out there who don't know that you can't trust the [[internet]], in this instance because it is full of crazy [[lesbian]] rapists.

As it turned out, lamb101 and fuzzy_mazza lived in the same city, and were around about the same age. So fuzzy merkin did what any normal person who just met sa random lesbian on the internets would - [[lolwut|transfer to her school]]! 

They were an item for several months until one fateful day when it all ended in [[raep]], well, it was rape at first anyway until several days later when lamb101 ''consented'' to the sex. Whilst being threatened by fuzzy mazza, which means it wasn't rape at all.

The drama that started after this was entirely too confusing and bizarre for most of it to be written here, but it includes fuzzy_mazza's old petrol-sniffing female friend dating lamb101 and continuously threatening to [[internet tough guy|kill fuzzy_mazza]]. Lamb101 then dated a man and fuzzy_mazza [[lol|threatened to kill him]] and all of lamb101's friends, even though she had never met them eventually forcing lamb101 to take out a restraining order.

==GaydarGirls Killer==
After breaking it off with fuzzy_mazza, lamb101 decided she was straight, and got herself a boyfriend. Although it didn't last long, it gave enough time for fuzzy mazza to develop some serious [[internet killer]] feelings. The lucky man was known only as Toblopo and lived two states away, fuzzy mazza never even met him.

Before lamb101 went out with Toblopo, she got out a restraining order against fuzzy mazza that lasted for a year. Fuzzy mazza decided that it would be "[[crazy|poetic]]" if she killed Toblopo on the day that it ran out. He heard about this, and found it so hilarious, that he went out of his way to be in the same city as fuzzy mazza during that day.

The day passed, and Toblopo was still alive. Two days, three days passed, with no word from fuzzy mazza. Finally, on the day that Toblopo had to fly back home, he thought he'd help out fuzzy mazza with her plans to kill him several days before. He went to the local grocery store, where she worked in the highly respected position of checkout chick, and made sure to purchase some small item from her checkout.

Fuzzy mazza did not recognize him. Finding this all the more hilarious, Toblopo decided to pay by cheque, so he had to sign his name. He signed his name on a check, and handed it to fuzzy mazza. Fuzzy mazza still did not realize who he was, despite the fact that several days before she had been swearing that she would kill him. Nobody had realized quite how dumb she was until that day.

==LiveJournal Killer==
Way back on [[LiveJournal]], Fuzzy Merkin had a serious [[Friends only|FRIENDS ONLY]] journal, by the name of {{lj|user=roger_girl}} (she's since [[Deleting your LiveJournal|baleeted her LiveJournal]]).

One day some [[serious business]] went down on lj resulting in some severe butt-hurt [[transgender]] drama caused by one of lamb101's friends who has also since baleeted her LiveJournal. 

Fuzzy mazza started a series of her usual whiny [[bitch]] posts about how much she hated lamb101's friends and in one particularly dramatic post decided that she would threaten to kill lamb101's friend {{lj|user=tara_michelle}} over the internet. Huge drama spawned back and forth between Fuzzy mazza and Tara regarding this threat of violence, the police were mentioned several times, as was a [[lawsuit]]. Of course, like most e-drama, it all went away quietly. In this case, because Fuzzy mazza is a giant [[pussy]].
