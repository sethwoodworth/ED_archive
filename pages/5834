'''Nostradamus''' (known by his detractors as '''Nostradumbass''') is a highly [[controversial]] figure in history and (more importantly) on [[World of Warcraft|WoW]] where he is rumored to play a [[homosexual|faggot]] Night Elf. He is mostly remembered as the first [[Indigo child]] in recorded history due to his supposed [[God|supernatural abilities]]. Some claim that he was a [[prophet]] (moar liek [[profit]], [[amirite]]?), while others claim that Nostradamus was simply a [[French|Frenchie]] Jew trying to undermine the [[Bush]] administration. [[Conspiracy theorists]] [[cum]] every time they hear his name, as Nostradamus' prophesies could be used to support any theory that pops into their heads. Many believe that an intricate tattoo of [[Jonas Brothers|Nick Jonas]] on Nostradamus' [[Penis|bell end]] provides the answers to the [[Lost|world's greatest mysteries]], the most famously rumored of which is the time-old enigma of how [[Fucking Magnets]] work.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Nostradumbass.jpg|thumb|Nostradamus was an avid writer of Twilight fan-fiction. This is an actual photograph taken by his mom.]]

Nostradamus was born '''Michel de Nostredame''' in 1503, but he decided to change his name to Commander Cunt Destroyer, since there wasn't anyone who would [[Fellatio|take]] anyone with a woman's name seriously outside the kitchen. After graduating from [[college|ITT Tech]], Nostradamus joined the [[Hippy|Peace CORPS]] and became a Deadhead. Nostradamus attempted to obtain a PhD, but he was [[expelled]] when it was discovered that Nostradamus did some field work with [[voodoo]]. Despite his expulsion, Nostradamus became a practicing doctor anyway.

Unhappy with being a [[virgin]], Nostradamus decided to get [[waifu]] and some [[children]]. Unfortunately, the [[AIDS|Plague]] took his [[waifu]] and children away. As a result, Nostradamus decided to dedicate his life to combating the horrendous disease.

===Later life===
Later, Nostradamus realized that he could become [[famous]] simply by reading [[Cardcaptor Sakura|tarot cards]] and [[British|tea leaves]]. He wrote [[Shotacon]] novels and sold them to [[basement-dwellers]] who didn't know better. Nostradamus left cryptic messages that appears to tell the future, and he [[profit]]ed.

Afterward, he began to write quatrains using his [[psychic]] abilities. In order to make his cryptic prophecies [[Your resistance only makes my penis harder!|harder]] to interpret, he began using codes, puzzles, and other word games.

As with the year [[2012]], Nostradamus is a favorite of the History Channel. The History Channel commonly applies Nostradamus' prophecies to modern events in order to take advantage of the viewing public's increased paranoia. It often show evidence that Nostradamus predicted [[9/11]], the [[War on Terror]], [[Hitler]], and [[George Bush]]. The History channel even has a TV series known as the ''[[wikipedia:Nostradamus Effect|Nostradamus Effect]]''.
