LucidFox is the [[Wikia]] and [[Freenode]] Chief Ambassador to [[ED IRC]]. He thinks he is a [[furry]] but he's just an [[anime]] foxboy; he should grow [[moar]] fur. His lack of furry is even more obvious when one notes his lack of [[gay|(open) homosexuality]]. He is also [[Russia|Russian]].

Learn to spell [[Uncyclopedia]] and then enlarge your penis please.

== Is he logging this? ==
Yes.

== Is he pretty fucked up? ==
Yes. LucidFox, like our furry friend [[Duke Otterland]], is both [[bisexual]] and anti-gay marriage. Yet, unlike the Duke, LucidFox is seriously clever because he likes [[TOW|Wikipedia]].

LucidFox calls himself straight; whenever he finds himself wanting to think about guys in that special way, he imagines himself as a girl, a girl named Maia. And now he dresses up like one. Because somehow, that makes it still straight. [[no|Somehow]].

==Is he pedantic?==

Anyone who speaks fluent Orwellian Newspeak is not only a grade A pedant, they are a [[cock]].  For the record and to show that we at ED are not impressed by [[gay|faggotry]] of this magnitude a translation is: Encyclopaedia Dramatica is totally fucking awesome.  If I had a bigger cock I'd tap ED [[in the ass|in that ass]]. [[LOLDONGS]].

==Wookiecide==
Despite his positive stance regarding the [[GFDL]] and [[Linux]], Sikon has a [[microsoft|proprietary attitude]] towards his [[Unwarranted self-importance|precious]] material. He tried to treat [[Wookieepedia]] as if it was his private domain. His typical response to any disagreement was to insist his way, or he would [[Wikibreak|pack up and go home]], taking his [[Unwarranted self-importance|necessary]] [[Steve Ballmer|technical expertise]] with him.

During January 2008 he [[wikicide|killed]] his account due to anti-[[furry]] remarks   the community made against him on the [[wikia]] [[IRC]] channel.
