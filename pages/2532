ED Facebook
==10/11/09==
Despite Encyclopedia Dramatica's constant claims that we are not [[4chan|/b/]], this is taken to be a mere red herring for the denizens of Facebook. On November 10, 2009, ED's machine god decided to advertise the [[EDF|forums]] on the official Facebook page to attract hordes of new users and their sockpuppet friends to discuss enthralling topics such as [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/showthread.php?t=2979 The IRC fucking sucks] and [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/showthread.php?t=3091 Trap Of The Year]. What [[Yirimyah|the machine spirit]] discovered on the page was not a discussion of how many girls wanted to suck our Sysops' cocks, but rather a collection of morons spouting memes and acting like mouth-breathing retards.
To set them straight, God spoke. And they listened.<br>
Editor's note: If any of the people features in these quotes attempts to remove them, I'll post the uncensored version.
