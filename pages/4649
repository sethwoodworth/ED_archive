'''Krautchan''' was founded back in 1945 by [[moot]]'s grandfather after he had to leave [[Germany]] when his career took a little downturn. [[Truth|Krautchan has always been called Krautchan.]] It's yet another attempt at establishing a [[Germany|German]] Imageboard where you meet [[Hitler|friendly Germans]] that welcome you in a [[Gay|friendly]] manner. Typically, there are around anywhere between four and seven different people active, so don't expect too much traffic. Things change every time the Russians and Finns decide to provide it with [[Spam|content]].

They've also taken part in [[Project Chanology]] 2008.

On September 13th 2008, the death of Krautchan was announced. It lasted [[Deleting_your_LiveJournal|exactly one day]]. There was [[E-Tantrum|never a]] [[Hissy_fit|satisfactory]] [[Ragequit|explanation]] and most of the resident basement dwellers were too busy recovering from the shock to demand one, anyway.

April 15th 2010: After [[Gay|Berlinbernds]] presentation at a Blogger conference in Berlin the main page of Krautchan was replaced to disrupt the inevitable spread of cancer. This was successful for at least 2 hours, untill [[fag|Verraeterbernd]] announced [http://muelleimer.krautchan.net the new location] on [[Twatter]].

==Structure==

===Current boards===

Like other [[Chan|chans]], Krautchan offers a variety of boards the world will never need, confusing its never-growing user base of four [[13-year-old boy|Nazis]] and two [[Bot|chatbots]]. Most of these boards are blatant rip-offs from other chans, while some are the fruit of Bernd's own twisted mind.

''VIP''
* '''[[b/|/b/]]''' - Home of [[Sick fuck|Bernd]], this is an experimental board better not to fuck with. Please [[Crapflood|support]] it with depictions of [[Shitting Dick Nipples|beauty]] and [[Nigra|human]] [[Cock|superiority]].
* '''/int/''' - Originally created as /uk/ to provide a temporary home for [[British|Britfags]] while [[Britchan]] was [[Party van|down]]. Now it's filled with a wide range of foreigners [[Polandball|who used to make fun of Poland]]. They are also more than happy to teach you about the wonders of <s>[[Esperanto]]</s> [[Russian]]. Welcome to [[/x/|OMSK]]. [[Oldfag|Some argue]] that /int/ is  now a cesspool of Russians, Finns, Americans, Poles, 4channers and their memes. Local [[attention whores|celebrities]] include [[Asspie|Falcofag]], [[Engrish|Wojak]], [[Anti-Americanism|Amerirage/]][[Esperanto|NordAmerikano]], [[weeaboo|Cirnorussia]], [[lulz|Pedo-Kazakhstan]], [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|Emokiddeh]] and others nobody cares about.

''General''
* '''/a/''' - Official [[Wapanese|Weeaboo]] hideout.
* '''/c/''' - A board about [[Computer|Precision Engineering]] and all the [[video games|vidya gaems]] that are banned in Germany. Show your [[E-penis]] here or stay the fuck out, you have been warned.
* '''/d/''' - Here be drugs. Since it's a [[Germany|German]] board, you will find plenty about [[Jenkem|natural byproducts]].
* '''/e/''' - Post images of your food and discuss several ways of eating cum.
* '''/fb/''' - Get advice on how to finally lay a real girl.
* '''/fit/''' - The Board on which Bernd talks about never doing any sports, although some write fanfics about [[buttsex|exercising]].
* '''/he/''' - Offical emo board for Bernd to whine about all his [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|interesting]] problems he encounters in [[RL]], from [[Computer_Science_III|academic failures]] to [[Friend_Zone|failing at getting laid]].
* '''/k/''' - Rarely visited Board with a lot of potential. All kinds of [[Original character|creative]] shit goes here.
* '''/l/''' - A place to discuss [[Homosexuality|literature]].
* '''/li/''' - [[Homosexuality]].
* '''/m/''' - Music. [[ZOMG]] file sharing!
* '''/p/''' - Very serious board to ramble about [[politics]], home of conspiracy theorists.
* '''/t/''' - Engineering. Mostly cars and mobile phones
* '''/tv/''' - A board dedicated to movies and TV shows Bernd [[I_Don't_Watch_TV|refuses to watch]]. Mostly foreign stuff, obviously, since Germany is unable to produce any worthwhile entertainment.
* '''/we/''' - whine about your shitty live.
* '''/wp/''' - cats and nazis in wallpaper size

''Trial''
* '''/f/''' - discussion about cars and stuff.
* '''/jp/''' - [[Wapanese|Weeaboo]] overdose
* '''/sp/''' - hideout of [[Magic]] and [[Dungeons & Dragons]] playing [[Neckbeard]]s.
* '''/[[x/]]''' - [[UFO]] and ghost sightings

''Fapping material''
* '''/h/''' - If [[Your Mom]] doesn't want you to [[LURK MOAR|look at]] [[s/|/s/]] and you think three dimensional women are disgusting anyway, this is your board of choice.
* '''[[s/|/s/]]''' - The only [[lie|good]] thing about Krautchan. (Actually it's mostly boring)

''Other''
* '''/kc/''' - Where to [[Crybaby|harass]] the [[Retard|mods]] until they create stupid new boards nobody will ever [[Lurker|lurk]] on. Also the right place to [[Flamewar|politely comment]] on the [[Shit|beauty]] and [[Database error|smart functionality]] of the underlying software.

===Deleted boards===

* '''/ps/''' - [[Photoshop]] template [[circle jerk]]. Deleted because Germans prefer to steal memes and image macros rather than creating them by themselves.
* '''/w/''' Mk.I - A board about weapons. Deleted when they realized that [[Gun control|nobody is allowed to own weapons]] in Germany anyway.
* '''/w/''' Mk.II - Board for discussion of science and [[Hentai|ecchi]] (yes, seriously). Deleted for obvious reasons.
* '''/t/''' - A board about animals. Wasn't really worth the trouble because the only animals Germans seemed to like were run over and [[Citty_Glitter|burnt]] cats.
* '''/cam/''' - camwhores - Krautchan has none
* '''/f/''' - [[No_girls_on_the_internet|women]]
* '''/tw/''' - [[Furry|animals]]
* '''/vip/''' - [[pedo|family-friendly version]] of /b/. failed attempt to fight [[Cancer|TEH CANCER]]

===Administration===

As of today, there are three [[Retard|handsome guys]] to be blamed for the [[cancer]] that is [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|the existence of Krautchan]].

* '''[[Hugo Chavez|Shaky]]''' - Seems to host the site on his private server in [[Cuba|Florida]].
* '''Tsaryu''' - Primarily known for shitty [[emo]] [[Wapanese|anime-oriented]] poems he [[Masturbation|posted]] all over the [[Internets|net]] [[At least 100 years ago|at least 100 years ago]], ask him about these [[for the lulz]]. Knows how to [[Japan|moonspeak]].
* '''[[W._T._Snacks|Der General]]''' - Keeps an eye on the [[Crap|superior]] Desuchan software Krautchan is running on.

==[[Community|Subculture]]==

===Bernd===
[[Anonymous]] is called ''Bernd'' on Krautchan, which is a somewhat common and bland sounding first name in Germany. While descending from Anonymous, the average Krautchan user is even more [[Retard|special]]. Since the creation of [[lulz]] is an [[IRL]] bannable offense in Germany, many Germans are unaccustomed to the concept of free speech and upon discovering Krautchan, their first impulse often seems to be posting everything that's verboten in their home country (which includes pretty much anything that you could imagine, and then some) until they collapse from exhaustion. After this catharsis, they may either stay and become [[Idiot|valued members of the community]] or go back to the [[Gaia|anime shithole]] they came from.

In general, Bernd is much more [[Fag|helpful]], [[Slowpoke|patient]] and [[Serious business|polite]] than Anonymous (as long as you post in a language other than [[English]]), and quite proud of his own raids against [[16-year-old girl|international corporations]], [[Gaia Online|Animexx]] and [[Furry|evil]] [[Hitler|nazi]] black person.

The known mortal enemies of [[Sick fuck|Bernd]] are [[KGB|Schäuble]], [[Americans|"Ammischweine"]], [[Original content|INUVASHUN]] and [[freedom]]

===AIDS===
Since at least one user of Krautchan reportedly has [[AIDS]], Krautchan can proudly call itself an imageboard officially full of AIDS now.

===Fritzl===
To keep the memory of great [[Australian]] hero [[Josef Fritzl]] alive, Bernd has recently created a digital likeness of him in [[Habbo Hotel]], serving the community by offering helpless little girls shelter in his basement in exchange for [[Rape|sexual favors]].

===Fritzl 2===
They returned a year later, and raided Habbo Australia and Habbo Germany. Raid was about an hour. After 40 minutes, people pulled out. Some lulzy trolling occurred in the last 20 minutes. A hueg Swastiget was in Australia, and a smaller one in Germany.

===Memes===
====/b/====
Starting out with a handful of copied and horribly translated memes from other sites, Bernd has now evolved to the point where he's able to create [[Forced meme|content]] that is at least as [[unfunny]] as everybody else's. Should you ever have to visit Krautchan, these phrases will help you communicate with the natives:

* Halt die Fresse (HDF) - shut the fuck up (STFU)
* Geh grillen - kill yourself / become an hero
* Soße / Qualle - sauce
* Meer - moar
* Lauer meer - lurk moar
* Fagott spielen - being a fag
* [[Salih]] - a dead sandnigger, most likely the best meme on Krautchan.

Further [[protip|protips]]:
* Use Babelfish, which can translate from English to German with almost native fluency.
* To improve translation quality, use Babelfish more than once (e.g. English->Japanese->Hebrew->German).
* Read the article about [[Germany]] and make extensive use of copypasta. Efficiency is the key.
* Be sure to mention the [[WW2|war]].

====/int/====
[[File:Blinkenworld 08-12-2010 23-45.png|thumb|/int/ uses [http://daten.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/src/blinkenworld/index.html Nazi-Tech] to track its users every move]]
*'''[[Polandball]]'''  
*'''That feel''' when   ([[English language|English]] ''that feeling'', [[Chanspeak]] ''my face when''). This phrase and the picture of a worried  bald MS PAINT guy  has been isolated from one of the Wojak's [[shit|quality threads]] about [[BAWWWWW|seeking and trying to find a girlfriend]]. Since its outbreak in early 2010, this "meme" and its derivations become [[forced meme|one of the most used]] on /int/.
*'''REMOVE (x) FROM PREMISES''' [[LOLWUT|tupac alive in serbia]] ({{youtube|hl_GFSjRESk|YouTube link}})  was first introduced to /int/ by some macedonian from [[Turkey|Istambul]] called "Sergej".

[[Image:Krautchan_fake announcement original.jpg|thumb|200px|Teh unfaked ORIGINAL!!!111]]
[[Image:Krautchan_down Quality journalism.png|thumb|200px|Krautchan is down]]
On March 11th 2009, D-Dorf-Bernd used his mad photoshop skills to fake a [[Nothing_of_value|message]] from german shooting star [[Tim Kretschmer]] in which he allegedly describes his intention to crack [[Cho]]'s highscore. The stupid German police fell for it and the home secretary read the fake posting in a press conference. Later the posting was verified as being authentic after they seized Tims computer. Every major German news show subsequently quoted the fake post while Bernd met in IRC and fapped his dick off.

On the next day, the tiny Krautchan servers couldn't handle the internet fame, and their server is down for the time being. 

They decided however to share the [http://krautchan.net/b/thread-485465.html epic thread] with the rest of the world.

After media learned about their error, they based their reporting on peer reviewed articles in an internet encyclopadia.
