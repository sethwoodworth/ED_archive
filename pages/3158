<s>Update #3: Futabachannel is back, a few boards are up at the moment and it's being spammed to death on 4chan's /b/. Apparently, the new mascot is Big Boss.</s> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]

''Futabachannel.org'' was run by some faggot a username of xghettohoodx and thinks he is Asian. The faggot spent days after days customizing the [[kusaba]] script and called it "[[Cloverfield]]" after the ugly monster in the ''[[Cloverfield]]'' movie to make a new [[fail]] [[chan]]. After he was done, users from [[nexopia]].com and [[MySpace]] faggots poured in averaging 500 - 1,000 unique hits per day, according to Something Awful forums. Once upon a time, [[over 9000]] years ago, in the /i/ board, some [[newfag]] serial killer posted the blue prints to [[Scientology|Tom Cruise's]] house in an attempt to [[Pwn|assassinate]] him. The whole shitload of [[newfag]]s got excited and the /i/ board turned to chaos. Two days later, the website was intercepted by the [[FBI]] with some red message and all the [[newfag]]s cried like faggots and shat bricks in case the [[Partyvan]] might come after them. 

The website it self was shitty, The only thing that good about the shit hole of a fail site was the name, which the faggot ripped off 2chan.net. This is possibly why he got lots of hits.
