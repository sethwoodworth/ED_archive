Put Shoe On Head
[[Image:Originalshoe.JPG|thumb|right|First [[Evar]]!]]
'''Put Shoe on Head''' is the natural evolution of [[pornography]] on the [[internets]]. [[YTMND]] users acknowledge that, not only do they not have sex, but they are in fact not interested in it. They convinced [[camwhores]] on the web site [http://www.livejasmin.com LiveJasmin.com] to cater to their unique sexual needs.

== Methodology ==

# Go to [http://www.livejasmin.com LiveJasmin.com].
# Enter a free chat. Selecting a room from "Girls" is preferred, though you may choose from the "Boys" room if you are a [[fag]].
# Direct the performer to "Put Shoe on Head." Most of these girls are from [[China]] or [[Russia]] or some other [[Communist]] country, so [[Engrish]] skills are a must.
# The [[camwhores]] will try to entice you into giving them money by saying things like "I put shoe on head in pvt room bb." Don't believe that [[shit]]. They will give up the goods for free if you are persistent. Promising her you will pay for a private room if she puts penis on head and then just calling her a stupid [[FAGGOT]] and exiting the room is considered a fair and honest negotiation tactic.
# If a penis is not available, [[A cat is fine too|a keyboard, mouse, or other object is also acceptable]]. The more [[random]] the [[Stuff|object]], the greater the [[lulz]].
# Use whatever [[hacker]] skills you have to capture the image as soon as she puts shoe on head. Pressing your PrtScrn button and then pasting into [[MSPaint]] is considered particularly [[l33t]].
# [[????]]
# [[PROFIT]]!

[http://shoehead.ytmnd.com/ The first "Put Shoe on Head"] was created by [[YTMND]] [[last Thursday]], and resulted in many [[lulz]]. This encouraged [[YTMND]] users, who honestly have nothing better to do with their lives, to flood [http://www.livejasmin.com LiveJasmin.com] with Put Shoe on Head requests.

There is a Zen Koan about someone killing a kitten and how if they'd put a sandal on their head the Roshi wouldn't have done it. So it's religious or something. 

Most of the [[camwhores]] on the site comply, once someone is able to translate their demands into [[Engrish]]. Some find it difficult to understand why everyone wants to see them put shit on their heads instead of flash their nasty 3rd world [[tits]], but they eventually realize that it's pretty tame compared to [[Tubgirl|some of the other shit they do]]. Some of the native [[engrish]] speakers [http://footonhead.ytmnd.com/ misunderstood put shoe on head], creating more [[lulz]].

The owners of LiveJasmin.com were very angry that people had started to visit their obscure site. "Put Shoe on Head" demands were overtaking legitimate demands like "cn u stik ur fingers in ur azz plz/" and the owners would not stand for such harassment of their [[camwhores]]. The owners posted on the YTMND forums, threatening [[legal action]] for the [[harassment]] of their models (who were now finally making money) and [[copyright infringement]] for the screenshots that were posted. Like any threat of [[legal action]], this simply added to the [[lulz]]. Someone was nice enough to [http://proofreadfinalwarning.ytmnd.com/ suggest a more effective way to communicate the threat], perhaps most importantly; "consider a formal warning that doesn't involve pictures of orangutans drinking / smoking."

Meanwhile, various [[camwhores]] on LiveJasmin.com ignored orders from the website owners to not put shoe on head, and in fact embraced the YTMND community, which was good because most of the users [[Hugbox|really needed a hug]]. [http://livejasminvisitsytmnd.ytmnd.com/ Elljay Summers] caused many YTMND fanboys to [[ejaculate|bust a nut]] all over their keyboards when she actually visited YTMND in a live chat. [http://thebestshoegirlever.ytmnsfw.com/ SexyLexyforU] officially won at [[teh internets]] when she balanced several books, various bottles, a table, a hat, and of course her shoes on her head. [[Scientists]] everywhere agree that this is the coolest thing. [[Evar]].

However, "Put Keyboard on Head" has spread like wildfire in /b/. Raids happen almost nightly within /b/ at http://www.liveprivates.com/.  Recently, glamour models from the UK adult website  [http://www.glamourstarslive.com/ Glamour Stars Live] confessed to putting all sorts of items on their heads including gloves, a cup of tea, a laundry basket of dirty lingerie and huge teddy bear.

==The Dildo Singing Incident==

Say hello to the [[Logan Sperman]] female counterpart! Her nick on Jasmin is 1Lilith, and unlike Logan (who's a [[fag]]), this is an actual girl. On 2-11-2007 an ED user entered a live jasmin room and found a hot, nerdy, goofy girl in a room. After this EDiot told her some jokes she decided to playback a song in a [[dildo]], the ED user promised not to put the recording on ED OR [[YouTube]]. [[troll|He put them on both,]] which basically cancels each other out. After the EDiot told her she was now on ED '''and''' [[YouTube]] (same day) Olive took it really well and decided to do a [[Fail|Green Day]] song specially for us.

The videos were afterwards removed because YouTube serves Our Lord Jesus Christ.
