Kelly Hallissey
[[Image:kelly.jpg|thumb|150px|Kelly's method of extracting favors from admins leaves something to be desired.]]
'''Kelly Hallissey''' is some [[Basement dweller|basement-dwelling]] [[fat|fatty]] who got angry because [[AOL]] tricked her into agreeing to work for free for them. When she found out that even people with [[Asperger's syndrome]] were entitled to compensation for their time, she got angry and decided to sue them. She started an ill-conceived class action [[Internet lawsuit]] that resulted in lots of [[lulz]] for the AOL [[E-lawyer|legal team]].

After being laughed out of court, Kelly decided she was [[Final solution|quitting AOL forever]] and built up a squadron of [[skript kiddie]] [[scene]]sters that proceeded to endlessly terrorize AOL with electronic break-ins and [[denial of service]] attacks. It consists entirely of [[Asperger's syndrome|autistic]] males who hope to one day get laid by this enormously [[fat whore]]. They [[idle]] in #obs on [[EFnet]], where Kelly can be found threatening to have someone's shell account taken because she has [[cybersex]] with admins of companies.

Ironically, Kelly's website ([http://observers.net observers.net]) was built and is maintained (albeit poorly) by an unpaid cyber-sweatshop. Kelly lies awake at night worrying that her own volunteers will sue.
