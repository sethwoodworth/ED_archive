Daddy's money lesbian
[[Image:Springbreak.jpg|thumb|Two daddy's money lesbians at Spring Break.]]

A female college student who has never had [[sex]] with another [[woman]] and who has a boyfriend she will probably marry soon after graduation, but nevertheless declares loudly and frequently that she is in fact a [[Lesbian|daughter of Sappho]].  Typical statements include "I know I've never eaten [[pu55y]], but I, like, ''totally'' want to" and "I feel it's important that we as womynkind [[dildo|connect spiritually and sexually]], but I'm just not attracted to you."  She will most usually break up with her boyfriend in her sophomore year in order to be true to her new-found lesbian nature but will get back together with him late in her junior year, when she realizes that she has no interest in [[Lesbian#Epithets_and_Explanations|carpet-munching]] at all.  During this time she will also undergo an intense infatuation with [[Vegetarian#Vegans:_The_Hitler_of_the_Food_Chain|veganism]].

The name itself comes from another commonly-heard battlecry, "listen, daddy, you're going to have to find a way to come to terms with the fact that I am a powerful, beautiful woman who loves other powerful, beautiful [[woman|womyn]].  Also, I need you to transfer $900 into my checking account."

Every daddy's money lesbian has been [[Almost Raped|almost raped]] [[At least 100 years ago|at least a hundred times]].

Daddy's Money Lesbians often grow [[Tramp stamp|Ass Antlers]].
