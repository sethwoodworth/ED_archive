==Birmingham,UK==

Approx. 40 Anonymous throughout the day.<br>
Many lulz were had.  The police were cool, especially the one that roughed up the Big Issue seller and also told the Scilons to basically shove their complaint about our signs (but in a polite way).
Many people asked us questions.  We had our own Old Guard: Martin Poulter and the mighty Bruce!
