Enclyopedia Dramatica is not what it claims to be.

{{frame|For the last couple of years Enclyopedia Dramatica has been making "articles"  about us and various other things on their site.      Why?  They do it for sick pleasure,   and much like Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg they do not do the research and the end result is nothing but bullshit.

If they spend all their time making fun of sites like DA that it just proves that they have no life whatsover.


I conclude that the reason they do this is because they're actually aliens from another universe and are simply trying to use us as test subjects for their bizzare experiments.

My other theory is that they're actually a bunch of manatees like the creators of Family Guy were portrayed as in the Cartoon Wars episode of South Park.

Either that or they're working for Seltzer and Friedberg and are planning on helping them make a movie called Internet Movie or Insert Genre Title Here Movie.}}
