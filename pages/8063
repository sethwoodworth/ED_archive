Teenage Kings of Werribee
<center>[[Image:Teenagekingsofwerribeee.png]]</center>

The '''Teenage Kings of Werribee''' are a gang of highschool [[IRL troll]]s from [[Australia]] who [[rape|raped]] a mentally-disabled [[16 year old girl]], set her hair on fire, [[roman shower|urinated on her]], video recorded it and cleverly uploaded it to their [[MySpace]] as ''Cunt: the movie''. Less notably they also egged a taxi, bullied drunks, made chlorine bombs and dropped flares on a sleeping homeless person. They also ate all the [[soup]] that was supposed to last the [[Jews|Eskimos]] until [[2007]]. Doing all this made them [[No|pretty cool guys]].

==History==
The trolls had produced DVDs of the event which they sold for $5 from their cars, apparently thinking there was a mass market appeal for watching them rape and beat a [[retard]]ed girl. In the film they refer to the girl only as ''The Victim'' and are noted for such quotes as ''What the [[fuck]], she's the ugliest thing I've ever seen'' and ''Everyone's scared to go first, they don't want any diseases''. 

Apparently the girl met two of the boys online through a ''popular chatroom'' and agreed to meet one of them at the Werribee station but was then surrounded by the punks and taken to an isolated area near a river. However, by looking at the example in the background of the Today Tonight story it appeared to be a nineMSN chatroom. They probably left this [[fact]] out to avoid defamation but at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] [[nobody gives a shit]].

The girl's father later appeared on [[television]] across [[Australia]] telling how his daughter's life had been [[ruin]]ed and that she could never hold her head up high. 

Sadly, [[/b/]] does not have a lot of money on hand and never received a copy when it was available, so the Teenage Kings are still waiting to break into the movie business. Sadly, there is still no full copy of the video known to exist on the [[internets]] but you can view some slightly graphic moments in the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKqcGyE_WJ8 Today Tonight Story]. 

It is known that one student was expelled from [http://www.werribeesc.vic.edu.au/ Werribee Secondary College] and that the video was available at [http://www.kardinia.vic.edu.au/ Kardinia International College] and Mary MacKillop College. The future of these [[fucktard]]ed [[13 year old boy]]s is currently pending but it is suspected they can look forward to many years of forced [[goatse|goatseation]] in prison.

==Retard Semantics==
The victim, whose real name is allegedly Freya, has been downgraded from "intellectually disabled" to "developmentally delayed." [[What|In other words, Freya was actually upgraded from disabled to delayed]].

Nonetheless, the [[dox|dox]] of the rapists will still be available for your [[masturbation|pleasure]].

==Jail Time==
Originally eight of them were charged with procuring sexual penetration by intimidation, manufacturing child pornography and assault. [http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/boys-highfived-in-gang-rape/2007/04/05/1175366381618.html On April 5 2007] five of our heroes were charged with aggravated sexual assault. They were denied bail, in other words they are currently receiving forced [[goatse]]ation from [[Bubba]].

Due to them being [[underage]] at the time they undertook the brutal [[rape]] of a [[retard]] they will receive less jail time than an adult. However, due to the perpetrators being seven 17-year-olds and one 18-year-old at least one of them is going to [[IRL]] adult prison and should fear for his anus and all that is holy.

Sexual Crimes Squad detectives have charged seven 17-year-olds and one 18-year-old on summons over the DVD, which was circulated in the Werribee area, south west of Melbourne.

==Aftermath==
In a miraculous [[abortion|miscarriage]] of [[for great justice|justice]], the Teenage [[fags|Kings of Werribee]] have escaped what would have been surefire [[rape|surprise]] [[goatse|goatseation]] by [[Bubba]]. Instead, they received light sentences that include a year and a half of probation for all but three of them while two received year long probation sentences and one was able to [[OJ Simpson|get off completely]]. They will also be required to attend a [[liberal|counselling session]] for young [[pedophile|sex offenders]]. It also means that [[troll]]ing the fuck out of them is compulsory. 


Oddly enough, none of these [[sick fuck|upstanding lads]] plead guilty to [[rape]]. Instead they plead guilty to the lesser offenses of "[[love|procuring sexual penetration by intimidation]]" "[[r@ygold|making child pornography]]" and assault.

==Pwning [[Jackass]]==
[[Image:Johnnyknoxville.gif|center]]

Soon after the existence of Cunt: The Movie was discovered several [[stupid|genius]] [[jews|journalists]] realised the perpetrators may have been inspired by [[Jackass|Jackass: The Movie]] as the two titles are similar and their content revolves around performing stupid stunts.  A video can be seen [http://youtube.com/watch?v=dux9ZQI3CGc here].

Johnny Knoxville was very [[butthurt|inflamed]] by these accusations and denied them even though it is [[common knowledge]] that they are [[fact]]. He claimed that you could not compare getting run over by a bull to gang [[rape]], which is completely untrue. It is also noteworthy that during [http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,20652181-5006301,00.html his interview] Knoxville was so drunk he was barely coherent, which explains it all really.

Even though there is no proof or credible information it is clear that Johnny Knoxville is solely responsible for Cunt: The Movie, in the same way that Marilyn Manson was responsible for [[Columbine]], there's a pretty fucking obvious [[science|connection]].

==MySpace Pages==
Surprisingly, these pages are updated regularily. It would seem that everybody in Australia can access the internet, no matter where they are. These kids have enough time on their hands to do this, even though they are busy making  videos of them being [[anal sex|assfucked]] by guys named Molly or Sally or some other feminine name given to guys who weigh 250lbs and eat [[nazi|V2 Rockets]] for breakfast.

Despite the apparent fact that they are complete pricks doesnt stop them from having around 500 friends. Some weak attempts to raid their profile. I mean, three people could do more damage by flooding [[iichan]] in half an hour than anybody has ever done to these guys [[MySpace]] accounts.


===Sample comment left on one of the pages===

GO TO HELL you ugly lil shit!!!!!!]] 
:[[16 year old girl|from the gurl that wants to kill u!!!]]


===Educational influences===
Sources conclude to say that this school principal initially provoked the making of the film. Spouting such comments as "I dare ya" and "[[fail|You'll get extra credit]]", he was [[retard|confused]] when the film makers were charged with a crime. After this, he promptly [[scat|shat]] himself and [[B&|banned]] them all from his school [[IRL]].
