The tale of '''Cutout Dissection.com''' is not a tale of a website, but rather a person. That's right, worse than any [[So cash|Johnny Cash]] song or pronunciation fuckup. [[RAGE|There is now a person legally named after a website.]] Not just any website, but a website owned by [[PETA]]. Peta will never realize that having an army of crazy-ass, menstruating [[Nazi]] hoes is not particularly good for your image. Nevertheless, Cutout Dissection.com walks the streets, pouring animal blood on anybody with a fur coat or leather jacket or mean demeanor, leaving, instead of an angry mob, a wake of those who simply feel pity toward this [[crazy]] [[bitch]].

==The Depressing Life of a Stupid Bitch==
[[Image:Cutout_license_updated.PNG|thumb|[[lion|Jesus christ it's an ugly PETArd, GET IN THE CAR!]]]]
Cutout Dissection.com (yes, [[dumbfuck|the .com is actually part of her name]]), [[Prince|formerly known as]] Jennifer [[lesbian|Thornberg]], spent her childhood watching way too many [[Disney]] movies and now thinks that all animals have secret societies where everyone speaks English, eats cotton candy, and [[holocaust|knows the solution to all the world's problems]]. Sadly, when Dissection.com learned at 38 that this simply is not the truth, she went into a fit of denial and joined [[Hitler|Peta]]. Under the influence of [[drugs|mind-controlling waves of radiation]], she was commanded by Peta's leaders to sacrifice the only name she ever had for their own misguided cause. Cutout was a member of the street team for Peta for years, meaning she probably picketed the homes of anybody who happened to [[not gay|enjoy the taste of meat]] (which, incidentally, bears striking resemblances to [[God Hates Fags|WBC]].)

One day, Cutout went into class learning that she had to dissect a chicken. She baww'd at the teacher, but fortunately he wasn't afraid of this screaming little cunt and offered her a simple challenge: become a vegetarian for two weeks leading up to the project and he would let her off the hook. However, Cutout happens to be far too incompetent to handle something so morally simple, so she decided to instead bitch at the school board for forcing her to go through the icky process of learning and decreed that a human life is worth [[slavery|three-fifths]] of an animal life.

This crackpot has been a member of PETA for so long that she actually believes that simply changing her name will attract attention toward her cause instead of making her seem even more [[insane|batshit crazy]] and, as always, driving people away from PETA's inherent craziness.

==Purpose==
[[Image:Christcat.jpg|thumb|[[science|SCIENCE!!!]]]]
Cutout believes that 6 million animals are killed every year due to [[science]]. She has, undoubtedly, been smoking the [[pot|reefer]], as animals are generally dead before dissection, and, if not, sacrifice their meaningless lives so that people can [[wat|learn]]. However, Dissection.com DOES provide a very simple solution: provide high-performance computers to every school in the country that are capable of running complex 3D interactions and rendering even more complex models of fully realistic dead animals for students to try and figure out how the fuck they are going to cut up this thing without [[divide by zero|crashing the school's network of computers]] and destroying the world in a fiery ball of nothingness.

==[[Lulz|Fun Facts]]==
*Dissection is required to become a veterinarian. This means that Cutout is, in turn, killing more animals than she is saving.<br>
*The minimum requirement for running complex 3D shit is 512 MB RAM and a computer made in this millennium. The average school relies on Windows 95.<br>
*Animals are <strike>worthless</strike> delicious.<br>
