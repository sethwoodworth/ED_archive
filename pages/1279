'''''Ctrl-Alt-Delete''''' is a [[Redundant|shitty webcomic]] produced by renowned [[douchebag]], [[fail|plagiarist]] and [[attention whore]] [[Tim Buckley]]. It is known throughout the webcomics [[circlejerk|community]] and the wider [[internet]] community for being amongst the [[gay]]est [[shit]] that was ever shat. [[Some argue|It is widely regarded as]] a masturbatory wish-fulfillment fantasy for Tim. It is also renowned for having characters with exactly the same [[facial]] expression in every panel. Also known as B^U to /[[v/]]irgins and /[[co/]]mrades. A prime example of the tired formula for a gaming webcomic consisting of [[gamer|gamer-guy]] who is [[stupid]], irresponsible, and should become [[an hero]] immediately, rooming with nice-guy who is responsible, and has every reason to murder the aforementioned character type, and [[bullshit|hot-gamer-girl]] who always falls for gamer-guy despite his active neglect, stupidity, and neverending "lovable" idiocy that usually has a fairly high price tag cost.

Due to recent stupidity, B^Uckley may be instilling a series reboot, starting with the separation of Ethan and Lilah, Lucas and whoever his [[Your Mom|girlfriend]] was, and the decapitation of that Xbox robot thing.  Details to follow.

==History==
In 2002, Tim Buckley was a poor artist struggling with his [[fag|sexuality]], [[n00b|poor gaming skills]], [[DeviantART]], when he came across [[Penny Arcade]]. Realizing that ''Penny Arcade'' and ''VG Cats'' hadn't suckered everyone in yet there was a possible gap in the market for yet more atrocious gaming webcomics.

At first, ''Ctrl-Alt-Delete'''s [[idiot|readers]] were easily amused by such [[old|new and refreshing]] lame slapstick gags as people being shot by arrows and rude language. Sadly, Tim saw this low-level [[fail|popularity]] as akin to [[unwarranted self-importance|internet fame]], and everything started to go downhill from there.

=="Characters"==    
[[Image:cadtruth.jpg|center]]
[[Image:B^U In my Wikipedia.jpg|right|thumb| B^U?  In my Wikipedia?  It's more likely then you think...]]
[[Image:Shavedethan.jpg|right|thumb| Cannot unsee...]]

===Ethan===
Ethan is essentially [[Mary Sue|the online persona of Tim B^Uckley/Thrindel]], only he displays none of B^Uckleys love of underage sex. He is a bumbling, woefully socially inept human, like B^Uckley, and also like B^Uckley, has created the worlds first robot sidekick in a webcomic...Oh wait. As B^Uckley is Ethan and Ethan is B^Uckley, every inane, self-destructive, ridiculous thing Ethan does is treated less as the actions of a dangerous sociopath and more the delightful flailings of a puppy.  Rather than be arrested, beaten or simply shot for his actions, he is applauded, as though he were a tiny boy who has just pottied in the pot like a big, big boy.  When not failing to create lulz, he is busy failing to create lulz through outlandish story arcs, more specifically though, the CADbortion arc, in which his dumbass girlfriend loses her baby. It is expected that this will be explained in an upcoming arc where it is revealed that Ethan has mutant [[sperm]], just like B^Uckley.

===Lucas===
Lucas is the quintessential [[gay|straight]] man, in that he has absolutely no personality of his own and exists only to serve as a frame for Ethan's supposedly entertaining "[[retard|zany]]" behavior.  He is a harsh, hollow parody, a mockery of a man that in the end serves no purpose apart from to illustrate that Tim Fuckley has no idea how real people think, act, speak or behave. Despite his recent attempts to break away from his poisonous life and get an education, this pitiable sadsack will more than likely work at Ethan's video game store as a retail jockey for the rest of his life because, [http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20090501 as Lilah is quick to remind him,] Ethan would do anything for Lucas. You know, like that time he [http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20070929 stole Lucas' wallet to commit identity fraud] and [http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20071001 get a job at Bioware so that he could steal a video game or some shit], only to [http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20071022 lie about it and crush Lucas' dreams]. That Ethan, what a wacky rapscallion/wonderful friend!

===Lilah===
[[Image:CADpervert.png|right|thumb|Tim is a known Pikaphile.]]
[[Image:The guys.jpg|right|thumb|You gotta give them credit. At least they didn't pull a ''[[Megatokyo]]''.]]
Ethan's girlfriend. It has yet to be explained why she is attracted to Ethan, given his penchant for being the online persona of Tim Fuckley. She looks identical to every single girl that B^Uckley has ever drawn. Also, in case you didn't know, because they almost never talk about it, she had a [[abortion|miscarriage]]. What B^Uckley didn't realize was that her miscarriage was the [[lulz]]iest "plot twist" to come out of CAD, as evidenced by the official lulz generator on the planet [[Anonymous]]. It's highly likely that Fuckley simply did not know how to draw a human child, even with a CADface, and gave up on it.

===The guy who hates Microsoft/loves Linux===
One day, in a desperate bid to create a new character that shared none of the tastes of the others, Buckley was reading ''Penny Arcade'', another shitty webcomic. Suddenly he came upon the Apple guy/whatever his name is, and realized that he could photoshop the character into his own comic. Somewhere along the line, he altered the character to not look like him. [[Shit nobody cares about|No one cares]] because both webcomics suck dick.

===X-Bot===
Similar to [[Linux]] Guy, Tim B^Uckley, in a fit of retardation, stole another character from the same shitty webcomic. In this instance, it was a robot.  In CAD, Ethan built him. That's right, Ethan builds fully functioning humanoid robots, but can only get a job working in a video game store. Recent studies suggest that he's the [[360 kid|Ecksbawks Kid]]'s long lost brother.

===Ethan's Now-Former Boss===
Note how, as we go down through the characters, the comic appears to be so full of stupidity as to lead readers to question the author's own grasp on reality. The fact that Ethan's ex-boss never fired him proves this. Ethan frequently creates scenarios where he would not only be fired, but arrested and [[Party Van|thrown in jail]]. Just like B^Uckley. Furthermore, after some [[shit nobody cares about|interesting plot developments]], Ethan's boss retired (at 30?) and gave Ethan ownership of the game store. So now Ethan, through dumb luck, is suddenly the boss himself. This once again brings into sharp focus the comic's stupidity and the author's grasp of reality.

===Rob===
Ethan's former co-worker at the video game store and now his employee. A bald guy with an earring that says "dude" and "guy" a lot, Ethan hates him with a fiery passion, constantly insulting him. He's even tried to kill or at least seriously maim him on a few occasions, like by pushing a vending machine on him. Why? Because Rob likes [[Counter-Strike]] a bit too much. That's it. Which once again shows how much of an unlikeable dick Ethan is.

===Chief O'Brian (geddit?)===
The chef is one of the more annoying characters in the septic tank of CAD, which is saying something. Much like Linux Guy, the Chef is a blatant rip-off of an IRL (that is to say non-webcomic) comic book character, [[goth|Happy Noodle Boy]]. While Happy Noodle Boy was [[lie|fully capable of generating small amounts of lulz]], B^Uckley, and by extension, the Chef, is not. This is the character who B^Uckley reserves for his lazier moods and as such, it is incredible that he's not in every story.

===Failbot 2.0===
Shitty robot  named Embla (moar like [[NAMBLA]] amirite?) <strike>Buckley</strike> Ethan made to [[fuck]] his other shitty robot.  Probably will [[masturbate]] while watching them.

===Baby===
Wait, what? Oh, that's right, I forgot, [[Dead baby|IT DIED]], [[Failure|TOO BAD]]. [[Lulz|LULZ]].

==Differences from Penny Arcade==
[[Image:Tumbleweed.gif]]
== The RoM Incident ==
Whilst CAD had been watching its reading on the failure-o-meter increase for several years, there remained one element about it that did not follow this pattern. Rantings of Madmen was the closest the CAD forums had to worthwhile content. It was an island in which the odd funny post could be found amongst a sea of [[emo|emo kids]], [[otaku]], [[fags|Tim's groupies]], [[Basement-dweller|basement-dwelling nerds]] and [[furry|furries]]. 

On [[9/11|September the 11th, 2005]], a post was made in RoM called "This thread contains a motherfucking forum revelation". The thread alleged what many had long suspected: Tim was a closet [[pedo]], who had sent pictures of his shriveled and malformed [[cock]] to under-age forum members. Some lol'd, some refused to believe it, some maintained they knew it all along.

[[Image: Pedobear.png|thumb|left|The RoM Incident proved, without a doubt, that Tim was actually [[Pedobear]].]]
[[Image: Thetruthaboutbuckley.jpg|thumb|right|What the comic might have looked like, had it been more true to [[IRL|real life]].]]
[[Image: Tim-meets-ann.jpg|thumb|right|[[Some argue]] that Tim Buckley is a [[pedophile]].]]

[[Image:FuckleyFurfag.jpg|thumb|left|Figures that Fuckley's fanbase includes [[furfags]].]]
Suddenly, Tim found it, and like any sensible adult who was innocent of a wrongful claim put against him, threw a huge fucking hissy fit. He waded in, [[banhammer]] swinging left and right. Dozens of users who had posted in the thread, guilty of deflating his ego or not, were b& instantly and without mercy. 

[[Image:Ban.jpg|thumb|right|Tim proved his wit by posting lame [[Banhammer|banned]] macros and using [[stupid]] one liners. Notice the lack of [[lulz]].]]


At this point several mods rebelled and unbanned all of the [[Banhammer|banned]] users, provoking a massive shitstorm in which RoM posters [[spam]]med the entire [[forum]] with [[guro]] and [[goatse]] [[image]]s (Oh and week-old [[4chan]] macros). Using IRC, all banned users and banned mods were unbanned just as fast as Tim could ban them and handle the spam problem. Eventually, he gave up, deleting the Rantings of Madmen section and eventually locking the entire forum for five days with the message "forums are down whilst we take out the trash". At the end of the battle [[Over 9000|9,002]] users had been removed from the forum database, but the entire [[internet]] saw how much of a batshit insane [[faggot]] Tim was, marking a mass exodus of readers and the elimination of any respect he may have once had.

After it was all said and done, several weak faggots who had previously been sucking up to everyone in RoM decided to kiss Tim's [[ass]] instead, resulting in the modship of such faggots as Cyanide, Abbadon and Sidnaceous, and the introduction of a [[Nazi]] [[police]] state on the CAD forums.

RoM moved on to [http://www.hockeyzombie.com/forum/index.php its own forum], not having much more to do with anything, but occasionally emerging to laugh at whatever stupid bullshit Tim was up to at the time. Whether or not Tim actually DID show his penis is debated furiously to this day, but most agree he wouldn't have been such an over-reacting fuckwit if he was innocent.

==Forum==
With the elimination of RoM, the CAD forums were finally overrun with AIDS. They are now filled with some of the web's biggest [[fags]] and [[noobs]]. Run by Sidnacious, a [[JDR|gender confused]] stay-at-home breeder who considers himself supreme lord and master of the forum, they take the [[internet]] far too seriously after the RoM Incident. Now any flaming, sexual orientation insults, and legitimate [[lulz]], mention of RoM, or criticism of Tim receive an instant [[banhammer]]. (Who is only referred to as such in whispers and private messages since [[mod sass|calling anyone a Nazi there will get you banned]].)

It's also ironic that the forums were changed to be kid friendly, and in Sidnaceous' signature is some stupid shit about cat semen rolling off his lips. He's a [[furry]] at best. Never go there unless it's for trolling. Unfortunately his wife does all the breadwinning, allowing Sid to sit at his PC all day and instantly ban you, ruining any fun unless you know what you're doing.

The other subforums are run by their own breed of [[capitalism|psycho]] Nazi [[admin]]. For example, the "art" forums are run by a psychotic self-righteous [[fucktard]] who [[flame|flamed]] the 'noobs' work so horribly even he got banned. [[Srsly]] though, it's all pretty crap. And loaded with furries. In fact, it's better if you avoid it altogether. It's pretty much devoid of any lulz opportunities at all. Also, there's that psychotic bisexual hillbilly. He likes Top Gear or something.

I would also like to point out that these videos has more emotion than anything B^Uckley has come up with.

<youtube>D0eYbXCF9mw</youtube>

Tim eventually realized, like all capitalistic money hungry whores do, that he needed another way to [[Buttsecks|screw]] over his fans. To achieve this, he teamed up with Blind Ferret Entertainment. He grabbed his unnecessarily expensive Wacom, a bong, a load of weed, and went down to the studio, where everyone got seriously baked, made some random crap, and slapped a price tag on it.

When he made an article about it on his page, the readers instantly realized what he was up to. [[Anonymous|Someone]] brought a copy with some money they stole from a hobo, torrented it, and sent the link to everyone. Tim got really pissed that people were selfishly hanging onto their money rather than sending it to him, threw yet another hissy fit, then went home and cried. Just another day, really.

To make matters [[Homosexual|worse]], the animation is worse than four-year-old pieces of shit on [[Newgrounds]]. The voice acting is worse than ''Resident Evil 1''. The "episodes" don't even last as long as taking a decent [[shit]]. Anybody who willingly paid [[over 9000]] for the DVD is welcome to become [[an hero]]. And to make matters worse, [[Jack Thompson]] is in the last three episodes. Isn't that profiting off his likeness? He should sue Fuckley [[for the lulz]].

==The CAD Rule==
[[Image:Vg cats.jpg|thumb|left|100px|This pretty much sums up every single comic.]]
At some point in time, [[4chan]] got fed up with the general shitfest that is Tim Buckley's recent comics, and instigated a simple rule to make his comic much more tolerable and lulz worthy. By the simple act of removing the second and third panels, and removing the text from the fourth panel, the comic is made much funnier (which, ironically enough, isn't hard to do since the comic has long since been devoid of anything amusing and filled with walls of text and storyline faggotry). Any redundant panel in CAD is generally referred to as a Buckleybox. A second variation to the CAD rule is replacing the fourth panel of the comic with the fourth panel of "It's a Zu out There" (original plox). Not as lulz worthy, but the edits are still vastly superior to the original comic.
*The CAD Rule V:3.0. Simply replace any last panel of a comic with the final panel of the CADBortion comic. [[Anonymous]]'s [[b/|top scientists]] have found that this elicits much [[moar]] [[lulz]] than even the original CAD rule.

[[Image:StillBuckley.jpg‎|thumb|right|The miscarriage drama in a nutshell.]]
Further adding to the webcomic's mind-numbingly [[Megatokyo|retarded pool of unfunny, undramatic plot drama]], Tim Buckley decided it would be fun to [[Abortion|kill off]] the [[bitch]]'s unborn child ''(This is probably the funniest comic he's done to date''). When asked why he thought a [[Falcon Punch|miscarriage]] would be a particularly good plot turn, he gave a [[tl;dr]] response on his website about character building and plot or some [[shit]].  This shows that not only is Buckley an [[unfunny]] [[hack]], but he's also a fucking lunatic for thinking that his shitty little webcomic actually has anything close to an engaging storyline or good characterization. Also, he would have had to make a new drawing of a [[fat]] [[bitch]], and that was too much work. Naturally, some [[Emo|wept]], some [[Chris Benoit|raged]], and [[Anon]] fired up [[Photoshop]] to extract some [[lulz]] from the situation.

===CADbortion Comic Code===
Some [[goon]] created a program that randomly generates CADbortions for Lulz. 

The Download is [http://theseusgoon.googlepages.com/cadmapper.rar here] Just extract it and run the Jar and hit Go and instant lulz is created.

Fuckley would go on to thank his fanbase "from the bottom of my heart for your overwhelming support" for all the emails he got. Yeah, that's right. Comfort ''me''! The guy who drew a comic with no words and made the bitch lose her spawn, not ''actual women'' who miscarry. Attention-whore Douchefag Status confirmed.

Only time will tell if Fuckley chooses to see this intentionally unfunny plot twist through, complete with crushed relationships, grief counseling, alcohol and substance abuse, and his author inserted fantasy persona maturing into a real man and taking serious charge of the situation, AND sustain this for the months and maybe years it would take to properly unwind this tragedy, or if he'll just jump the shark ''again'' and dive right back into the lulzless shitfest that is his comic as if nothing ever happened.

</center>

===The Internet Says Fuck You===
After trying to pull off this retarded "plot" twist, Fuckley has been ceaselessly mocked by many people and webcomics, including ''Cyanide and Happiness'' and ''[[Zero Punctuation]]'', showing that even people so low down on the internet food chain as less popular webcomic artists and [[Video Game Reviewers|Angry Video Game Nerd clones]] consider Fuckley an idiot.

====B^U gets removed from TOW====
On March 3rd, the shittastic comic had its article removed from [[TOW]]. The reason given was "non-notable subject with only primary sources. Little information exists to replace primary sources, excepting a meme spawned at the comic's expense." Read the discussion [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel here].

===How The CADbortion Story Arc Should Have Gone===
"Shortly after the latest comic, Lilah blames Ethan for his carelessness and reckless attitude during the entire pregnancy process and the wedding plans. She cancels the wedding, and tells Ethan that she needs time alone, and plans to return home to her parents after her stay at the hospital is over.

Ethan's day only gets worse when he arrives home to discover a crowd of people and ambulances surrounding the area, trying to aid Lucas, who had [[fail|fallen off a ladder shortly after Ethan left for work]]. Lucas is pronounced dead on arrival.

Ethan spends the next three days sobbing uncontrollably. A message from the Gamehaven blares from his answering machine, stating that he's been terminated from work after leaving his post for the fifth time unattended (lol, [http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20080825 maybe]).

Ethan decides he cannot live with the burden of losing his friend and loved one, and decides to end it before he hurts another with his stupidity. He deactivates Zeke and wipes his data, throwing him outside next to the trashcan in the hopes that someone will collect him ([http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20080908 close enough]), and returns inside [[an hero|to hang himself with an Xbox controller cable, the crown of Winter-een-mas laying under his feet]].

Elsewhere in the household, Linux guy and his pet penguin sit at their desk with a wicked grin, wearing a headset for each and looking over a little black notebook."

===/v/ under CADbortion madness===
The CADbortion threads were lasting so long and were being posted so often that the mods on [[4chan]]'s [[v/|/v/]] got pissed off and started banning people for starting new threads.  /v/ rejoiced.

==Fuckley Cops Out==
Realizing that his comic is so beyond repair that even the 4chan CAD rule cannot save it, Tim has begun cranking out three panel shit comics that follow a very basic formula:

'''PANEL ONE:''' Author-inserted fantasy persona reads the title of an article on Kotaku.
<br>'''PANEL TWO:''' Level-headed sidekick asks a question.
<br>'''PANEL THREE:''' Primary faggot farts out of his mouth. 

Alternately, you can replace the above formula with discussion on children's cartoon characters having sex.

This image proves Buckley's complete lack of originality. Even this piece of crap was stolen from other webcomics.

==It's not hypocrisy when I do it you see==

Once again, Fuckley has proved himself to be an art-thief of spectacular ineptitude. Shitstorm in progress on the forums.

TIM SPEAKS:

From.I'm in NYC for a wedding this weekend. Posting this from my Droid, so I'm going to keep this brief.

I saw that picture in an article about punk concerts while researching character reference for Abigail. I needed clothing reference for a style of dress that I had only a passing familiarity with.

That drawing was among many I looked at, and had clothing that I felt matched the character I had in my head.

I'm sorry if this seems underhanded to you, but it is not uncommon for an artist to look for reference when drawing something new outside their comfort zone
I don't believe people would be making a big deal if it had been a photograph I'd referenced clothing from. And as it stands, that is all I really did here. Best I could tell from the article (which had no link to the pic's artist ) this was a one-off pinup.

Again, if the artist would like credit for the clothing inspiration, I am more than happy to offer it. I will happily apologize to the artist when i get home if je feels wronged. But there was nothing villainous at work here, despite how much some would love to paint it as such. I looked for an outfit for a character and found one I liked.

TL;DR, he stole it and admitted to it on his board.
