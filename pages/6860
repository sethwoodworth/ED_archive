Dr '''Raymond Kurzweil''' is an American author, inventor, futurist and proponent of [[transhumanism]]. He spends his time lecturing to idiots at conferences like TED or at his fake college ''Singularity University''. The rest of the time he spends opining about the technological equivalent of [[The Rapture]] - the Singularity - wherein artificial intelligence gets good enough to simulate human consciousness, and we all decide to upload our brains into Wikipedia.

Kurzweil really doesn't want to miss the Singularity, so he now pops more dietary supplements than your average Miami Beach gym rat and drinks gallons of water every day "to flush out toxins". He's fully signed up with ALCOR, the cryogenics company. When Kurzweil dies, he'll get shipped off to the frozen body farm so some bored medical student can play soccer with his detached head. Despite knowing fuck all about medicine, Ray has now published three books on health and nutrition.

{{quote|It's intelligent design for [[I have a 140 IQ|the IQ 140 people]]. This proposition that we're heading to this point at which everything is going to be just unimaginably different - it's fundamentally, in my view, driven by a religious impulse. And all of the frantic arm-waving can't obscure that fact for me, no matter what numbers he marshals in favor of it. He's very good at having a lot of curves that point up to the right.|Mitch Kapor}}

== Singularity University ==
Like all good religions, the Singularity religion now has a fake college you can attend. $25,000 buys you nine weeks at Singularity University where you can listen to Ray Kurzweil and his fellow Singularitarians explain how you are on the way to becoming a cyborg, all the while hanging out with the sort of people who think the Singularity is coming. It's like real college, but you don't have to learn anything and you don't get a degree at the end of it.
