FurNation
[[Image:Yiffstar2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|You [[fucktards]] can't even [[fail|run a plot of land in Second Life]] - holding the world in your "paw" is a little ambitious]]

'''FurNation''' was a massive, sprawling virtual [[furry]] shithole in the pointless and stupid "game" of ''[[Second Life]]''. It consisted of two main elements. The first, a network of eleven laggy sims (a sim is an area in Second Life you can build shit on) functioning as the epicenter of <i>Second Life</i>'s dogcock economy and as the virtual residences for all <i>Second Life</i>'s most notorious [[furfag|war criminals.]] The second, a web-based forum which nobody ever read because they were too busy yiffing each other in ''Second Life''.

That was, until certain events put in motion by credit card fraud, debt, bankruptcy, [[lolsuit]]s and copyright infringement came to a head, causing the whole thing to come down like a house of pornographic cards drawn in MS Paint. <s>As of October 2008, [[victory|Fur Nation is no more]].</s> They came back like a month later. But on December 8th, 2009 their PayPal was shut down and the [[fags|administrators]] [[ragequit]] the internet. '''Seriously.'''

=The Sim Itself=

FurNation spends a fuckload of time and energy keeping their little boxes of dogcock and [[faggotry]] running. A bill of twelve thousand Lindenbucks (L$) per month, reportedly, that had to be paid from donations. More on that later, though - first let's take a look at the place itself.

==A Quick And Dirty Map Of Fur Nation==

'''FurNation Mythica, MAIN TARGET ALERT:''' A wretched hive of drama and yiff, and thus the most popular place in the entire of FurNation. Ironically contains a church, as well as a furry stripclub/brothel/AIDS den called The Ark. If you were looking for a good place to [[Patriotic Nigras|drop some ordinance]], this would be a good place to start.

'''FurNation Prime:''' Used to be as above, and the most notorious hellhole of furdom in the entire game. Done out in a ''Stargate'' theme, the pyramid is occasionally used by groups of furs for their unholy dances. Now abandoned due to being choked with self-described "[[unwarranted self-importance|auteur programmers]]" attempting to "Push the envelope" with their coding, thus drowning the wretched hellhole in lag. In other words, furry selfishness accomplished the goals of the [[Patriotic Nigras]] for them. 

'''FurNation Alpha:''' The art gallery. DO NOT GO THERE. FOR ANY REASON. THE [[Goggles|GOGGLES]] WILL DO NOTHING. Home to the "Furry village", meaning some of the smaller furry residences are here. Probably not worth targeting unless already occupied.

'''FurNation Kami:''' Residential area containing a UK-themed section. Also has moar churches, leading us to believe that maybe it isn't just [[Duke Otterland]] that prays for horse cock.

'''FurNation Vista:''' Laggiest part of FurNation due to 1) A sandbox full of eager furs trying out their new cocks, and 2) The fact that the server is dying of rickets after years of gang rape by the [[Patriotic Nigras]].

'''FurNation Gamma:''' Basically an overflow Vista. Not as popular, but equally trollable due to the people building giant statues of themselves with [[macrophile|Godzilla-sized dongs]] while considering themselves to be artists.

'''FurNation Worlds Mall:''' Dogwang, Ohio. Nightmare difficulty for trolls because everyone is only there on business. A glittering Xanadu for phishers, however.

'''FurNation Phoenix:''' Where you go to [[Mr Hands|get in touch with your inner pony.]] The residences here look like the shit your dad built you out of boxes because you were too poor to afford the [[My Little Pony Arena|My Little Pony Show Stable]].

'''FurNation Dragon:''' [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!]]

==The Owner: Corsi Mousehold==

It takes a [[Tumbles the Stairdragon|special kind of furry]] to not only garner the wrath of the collective internets, but also to utterly alienate even darkest niches of your own community. Corsi is that special kind of fur. Whether screaming racist abuse, threatening to call the [[partyvan]], purring [[occupatio]] in an [[Smugfag|attempt to look superior]] or simply pointing out that he has a nicer house or <s>more money than you</s> '''LOL NOT ANY MORE''', any conversation with Corsi is guaranteed to be chock full of lulz and drama. His drama-whoring in the SL community, his double-dealing with SexGen's code and his staggering lack of judgment (putting [[diaperfur]]s in charge of everything) have made him a veritable colossus of [[fail]].

One day, all the pariahs of the internet will get together and they will build a statue of Corsi (and then the PNs will crash it).

==The Beginning Of The End==

As previously mentioned, FurNation was a high maintenance sim running on the cash of furries, a section of society whose sole source of income is [[welfare|your tax dollars at work]]. Naturally a secondary source of income was needed, and in ''Second Life'' this is achieved by designing clever and creative code for virtual objects and selling them online.

Problem: As has been mentioned by both [[Anon]] and furry visionaries such as [[2 gryphon]], the grand majority of furs don't actually produce anything worthwhile; they just sit back and whine that people aren't producing nightmare spooge pictures for them for free, and quickly enough.

===How Do I Sexbed, /b/?===

It was due to these factors that Corsi decided to rip off some code from a user called Stroker Serpentine for a marvelous invention called Sexbeds - beds which, when used would cause one's avatar to perform...shall we say... "[[yiff|Certain]] [[bestiality|preset]] [[rape|animations]]." (It's furries. We're sure your imagination is plenty fertile.)

Soon a bitter [[lolsuit|dispute]] was well underway. Now, any normal person would simply surmise "God dammit, we got found out, we'd better find another way out." Furries, however, are not known for their keen grasp on reality. Furthermore, furries who have latched onto a self-declared e-personality like Corsi would rather saw their own spines off than admit defeat or even one iota of fault. Naturally there was only one course of action, leading to possibly the greatest quote in the history of furry fagdom:

{{quote|Raid? Wait, isn't that what Anonymous does to US?|WerewolfFan98}}

Brace for complete humiliation.

|WOW, What a Bunch of Furry Fucktards. This is EXACTLY WHY Everyone HATES the Furry community on SL. Corsi gets busted Stealing a Trademarked and Copywrited Business model and what does the Furry community do? It goes to DEFCON 1. Nukes, Spam, Griefing, & Group BS. It is no wonder Stroker wants you all to stop pretending to be Genuine SexGen, You make his Legitimate Business look like romper room.|LOL

TL;DR: Building starts burning down. Rather than get water, [[fail|furs start protesting against flames]]. And nothing of value was lost.

==The FurNation Website==

Even the most popular of websites runs into problems when everyone wants to read it but nobody wants to contribute anything to it apart from BAWWWWW THE SITE'S 504'D FIX IT NAOOOOOOOOOO! Nexxus Ambassador, sysop of Furnation.com was, actually flying in the face of a triple-threat:

#Anyone interested enough in the FurNation sim was actually there, instead of reading a website about it.
#The money that pays for your bandwidth is drawn from the same place that pays for your rent and your fursuit.
#THE SERVER'S DOWN FIX IT NEXXUS BAWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!1

In an attempt to save said fursuit money, Nexxus got his silly ass scammed by an internet scammer, leading to all the cash he had tied up in ''Second Life'' being [[lol|frozen for fraud]]. Now Nexxus is up to his ears in debt, and FurNation's web presence is set to met a similar fate to it's big brother.

The forums are thus little but a sad footnote next to the shitcan of the sim itself. Brave nigras with their sight set on raiding the site are therefore discouraged from doing so, especially as the site is protected by a FIFTY DOLLAR LEGAL FUND (WE'RE IN TROUBLE NAO, GUISE).

===The Downfall of FurNation.com===

====The Unsung War====
On September 23,  2008; the only active mod, Zion decided to fuck up with the whole site, and revealed himself to be an epic [[troll]] amongst the FurNation staff itself, creating more and more [[butthurt|butthurtness]] amongst the [[furfag]] community by [[banhammer|banning]] all the members and deleting all the forums threads. 
A successful single-man raid against a community of [[over 9000]] members anyways. The admin; Ghost Menjou, capitulated due to his [[aspies|inability]] to handle back the situation.

The staff was revealed to be [[Downs_syndrome|totally incompetent]] and unable to face Zion's actions inside the community.

====The Aftermath====
Later, after attempting to unban a few [[butthurt]] [[furries]], Ghost Menjou attempted to rebuild the community with a couple of [[furries]], but does so [[fail|unsuccessfully]].

====Give money plz====
Nexxus, the FurNation admin asked the remaining [[furries]] to donate all they can give to maintain the site up, pretending a phpBB forum and an image gallery requires $1,000 per months of bandwidth and hosting fees, which anyone with an once of common sense would find totally ridiculous. But that's basically what furries did, without asking any question.

Despite this, Nexxus and the furry donations combined couldn't even amount to 1/4 of the monthly bill, Furnation was surely doomed.

====Murder for the Fandom====
Despite not having the cash to maintain the site, Furnation was still up the next month. You might wonder what happened, or if the cash shortage was even real, though the truth is much more depressing.

Nexxus stole insurance money from his constantly sick mother, a lot of it. His mother later died when she couldn't pay her medical bills. On top of his stolen cash, Nexxus was further rewarded with his mothers inheritance money. Nexxus had indirectly killed his mother for the sake of Furnation.

You can read Nexxus' response to this on [[Talk:FurNation|this article's talk page]] if you want, but it's weepy and boring.

====A Great Troll Goes Out With A Bang====
On sunny Monday afternoon a great /i/nsurgent decided he'd had enough petty trolling of FurNation users. The member known as [[Internet Superhero|Kuda]]. Kuda succesfully posted a variety of shock images such as Pain Series and Zippocat in almost every thread on the shitpile of a site. Naturally the furries met this with much BAWWWWing and butthurt, however due to the sites new [[Nazi|democratic structure]] the only [[Fucktard|mods]] online were incapable of doing anything to halt Kudas spamming for several hours or simply were on his side and did nothing. Too add insult to injury Kuda also messaged the sites current leader [[Chris_chan|Vulpes]] warning of an /i/nsurgent mod, adding to the [[Aspie|Aspies]] already large list of [[Elitist|insecurities]]. Naturally Kuda was eventually banned, [[Goodnight Sweet Prince]], may we [[NEVAR FORGET]].

====Nexxus Proves Himself a Petty Troll/The Furnation Paypal is down!====

On Tuesday, December 8th 2009 FurNation's Paypal account was revoked for violating the 'Terms of Use' of Paypal's donation feature (due to the massive quantities of pornographic material on their website). In response to this, Nexxus decided to blame a fellow furry (and website owner of FurAffinity, a competitor website) Dragoneer. He stated that Dragoneer had 'alerted Paypal and flagged FurNation for violation' with no solid proof other than "A friend of mine said so." But of course, he was not about to reveal the name of that said friend, leading many to wonder about the validity of his statement. Of course, even if Dragoneer HAD done such a thing, Paypal would most likely not close a donation account until it was investigated first nor would it refuse to re-open it after it was investigated and found to not be in violation, which it of course was. 

After much ranting about how much he dislikes Dragoneer and spewing jealousies of FurAffinity's success, he cries out for help, begging the members of his site for money yet again 'to save FurNation', using this as his stance that he is just a victim and needs money to get back on his feet. If he can't get enough donations, he says he will shut down FurNation.

After the 'rant/blame game' post, many members FurAffinity were informed of the misleading and drama-filled update and went to post their own thoughts on his baseless blame. Of course the first few posts were in full support of FurNation and went along blindly to his accusations, but then posts began popping up supporting FurAffinity and calling out Nexxus on his lack of proof and immature way of handling things. Some members of FurAffinity signed up JUST so they could post a reply. It wasn't long before those replies were deleted. Every single one of them had been picked out individually and removed, the topic closed, leaving only the posts supporting 'how wonderful' FurNation was and 'how they had been wronged by FurAffinity' doing nothing but proving even more how pathetic they are. Congratulations Nexxus, you win the FAIL OF THE DAY for December 8th.

[[Image:FNRagequit.JPG|thumb|right|Furnation brought down by minor drama.]]
====Nexxus Pulls an Epic Ragequit====

Mere hours after Paypal donation fiasco of December 8th 2009, the entire site of Furnation.com was brought down.  The main page displayed only a black background with the text "Furnation is gone.  So long and thanks for all the carrots."  This hardly even needs lulzifying; such a petty bawwwwing response is absolutely hilarious on its own.

Nexxus shortly thereafter confirmed that the site has been brought down for good on his Twitter account:  "FurNation is offline, this time for good. So long and thanks for all the fish."  This will only serve to make the site's inevitable return more hilarious.  Furthermore, despite the the fact that he can't make up his mind between fish and carrots, he thinks quoting cliche'd Douglas Adams excerpts is actually witty.

To add additional lulz, Furnation has returned under <s>new management</s> a sockpuppet account to avoid the shame of being a furfag that only wants to be a faggot out for attention. Granny would be so proud
