==Background==
[[Image:Mikucase.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Fapbait for weeaboos and [[Audiophile|audiophiles]] alike!]]

In the [[Japan|grotesque land of weeaboos]], [[lonely|ronery]] [[weeaboos]] often find themselves turning to technology for [[Mai Waifu|companionship]]. However, [[Dating sim|dating sims]] can only do so much for a man, and there's only so much [[Sailor Moon]] [[hentai]] out there to [[fap]] to. And besides: These series' of still images lack the all important [[Audiophile|sound of the female voice]], offering the viewer the reassurance they so [[Desperate|desperately]] crave and the sweet moans of the female [[orgasm]]. So, Japan's top scientists developed a [[Software|program]] to emulate the sound of the female voice, dubbing it "Vocaloid", and market it as a [[Music|music-making tool]] so their fellow [[otaku]] could pretend they are musicians when the cashier rings up their girl-in-a-box.

In order to aide the masturbatory process, and in keeping with Japan's perverse tradition of [[Transformers|humanizing machines]], each Vocaloid version comes with an accompanying female figure made to match the voice. The first to sell well, and still the most [[Overrated|popular]] by far, is Hatsune Miku, who despite being the oldest and most antiquated of the current V2 series ''(The first line of the software series to actually fucking sell anything)'', continues to be [[Rape|put to work]] more often than the rest of her [[Yuri|digital friends]]. Not to mention, the most fapped to of Vocaloid's female cast. 

[[Image:Vocaloidgui.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Beauty is only skin-deep: This interface is awful.]]

Surprisingly, and in a turn of events not typical for the Japs, there actually exists more non-hentai fan-created content of Vocaloid characters ''([[AMV|Original music videos]], full-length albums, and attempts at producing [[fanime]])'' than there does [[Porn|fapping material]]. [[Shit nobody cares about|Some chalk it up to the program's practicality as a music-making tool]]. [[Some argue]] that weeaboos are so aroused by the sound of the female voice, they need not witness a [[Tits|woman in the nude]] in order to [[Cum|masturbate to climax]].

Whatever the case may be, there is no denying the impact Vocaloid has had on the [[RIAA|music industry]]. After the shocking confirmations that both [[Britney Spears]] and [[Lady Gaga]] are merely Miku [[Fan dub|lip-synchers]], and taking into account the astounding amount of Vocaloid music videos available on [[Ultimate Muscle Roller Legend|Nico Nico Douga]] ''(The [[Inferior|Japanese version]] of [[YouTube]])'', Vocaloid is a veritable [[P-p-p-powerbook|media powerhouse]]. With real [[J-Pop]] superstars having contributed their voices to the technology ''(Including the likes of [[Gackt]] and some other pop-star cunts you should be ashamed if you know the names of off-hand)'', a [[PSP]] game starring Miku ''(Which sold poorly due to the fact that nobody still gives a shit about the PSP)'', and even a Vocaloid-sponsored racecar in Japan's [[NASCAR|Super GT Series]], Vocaloid's success is a [[History|historic]] example of the influence porn has on the [[economy]].

==Characters==

===Miku Hatsune===

By far the most popular [[cunt]] of the bunch, Miku is the "singer" of many songs and the subject of much [[hentai|fan art]]. With her [[Animu|impossibly green hair]] and her trademark [[Leekspin.com|gigantic leek]], Miku has won over the hearts of millions of [[weeaboos]], despite never having been given an actual personality by her original developers. However, this has not stopped said weeaboos from wanting to [[Mai waifu|make her their wife]], so she can [[In the kitchen|cook onions for them all day long]].

Miku is not the first in a long line of the Japanese [[OS-tan|making computer software human]], but she is perhaps the most popular in recent years. Songs have been written about her being a [[Princess Portal|princess]], a rock and roll super star, and a filthy cum-guzzling slut servicing the weeaboo masses.

Having slept her way into the [[old media]], appearing in television commercials and making actual news headlines, Miku is fast on her way to becoming the new [[Oprah]] ''(If Oprah were a computer program and not black)''. [[2channel|2channers]] are also responsible for vote-bombing a petition set forward by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, to have a balancing plate for the spacecraft Akatsuki made with Miku's likeness embedded on it. Perhaps we should just go ahead and welcome our new software overlords, and maybe get to fuck our computers once before we humans are phased out of existence by green-haired music-making applications.

===Rin and Len Kagamine===
[[File:RinKagamineLenKagamine.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Twincest]] is the best.]]
Having discovered a voice actress that could produce the sound of [[trap|both a girl's and boy's voices]], the next installment of Vocaloid was released as a 2-in-1 deal, featuring twins Rin and Len Kagamine. [[Shit nobody cares about|Apparently, both characters are actually one in the same, and are actually the reflections of one another in a mirror or some bullshit that isn't properly explained]]. But, for all intents and purposes, and according to most weeaboos with [[incest]] fetishes, the two are brother and sister, and enjoy long nights of noisy steamy incestuous intercourse.

Perhaps their biggest claim to fame is Rin's appearance in the motion picture epic, [[Ultimate Muscle Roller Legend]], where she stars alongside [[Gay|Billy Herrington]] as a creepy-looking steamroller driver. To date, her brother Len is still entirely useless, as Rin is the female of the pair, and the majority of the population is still straight. That isn't to say there aren't those out there who don't want to [[Buttsex|slip their dick between Len's cheeks and shove]], but there aren't nearly as many who want to actually hear him sing.

===Luka Megurine===
[[File:Luka Tuna.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Banned|TUNAAA!]]]]
The 3rd Addition to the v2 Series. This is known to be the first [[Japan|Japanese]] Vocaloid to sing in [[Weeaboo|English]]. She is actually voiced by a man, so most of her songs sound like Lady Gaga's. She also lugs around a [[Cock|big tuna fish]] that's been out of the freezer for over [[9000]] hours for your listening and fapping pleasure. 

For whatever reason people use Luka a lot for metal music. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTZWdjzIyqc Here's an example.] She's also sometimes paired as Miku's [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g4DhoZFkWk lesbian lover]. Some fans bitch that she doesn't wear a [[moe|school uniform]] but she's like 20, what is she going to be doing wearing one of those?

===Kaito===
[[File:Kaitocat.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[A cat is fine too]].]]
Kaito was the last in the line of the original V1 series, and sold about as well as [[McDonalds]] at a [[PETA]] convention. However, after Miku made Vocaloid a household name, renewed interest in the product line's past allowed for Kaito to make a comeback ''(The four who came before him, however, are still shrouded in obscurity, as they sound legitimately terrible)''. He is known for his [http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Kaito friendly, tender, strong voice], and according to [[Some argue|some members]] of the fandom, is <s>husband</s> [[life partner]] to Len ''(Further reading: [[Vocaloid#Quotes|"Quotes"]])''. Of course, the latter "fact" is unlikely, as [[ALL CAPS|THEY AREN'T FUCKING REAL PEOPLE]]. Regardless, the [[sick fucks|Yaoi loving fangirls]] enjoy drawing the two screwing eachother in every way you can imagine.

Kaito is still rarely used, as Gackpoid aka Gakupo Kamui ''(Featuring the vocal talents of none other than [[Gackt]] himself)'' boasts a far manlier, [[Audiophile|higher quality]] voice.

===Meiko===
The first Japanese Vocaloid. Fans bitch about her voice because it isn't kawaii like Miku-chan's ^_^ so she's ignored. Everyone still draws her for the tits.

{{clear}}

===Teto Kasane===
[[File:Tetostrawberries.jpg|thumb|right|100px|When life gives you strawberries, [[Jam It In|J-J-JAM THEM IN]]!]]
Not an actual Vocaloid, but rather a "UTAUIoid"; a [[Free|freeware]] [[Inferior|alternative]] to the real Vocaloid series. The work of [[2channel|vip@2ch]], Teto was originally designed using said UTAU software, and was jokingly advertised as being an "[[Beta|upcoming]] Vocaloid", in what basically boiled down to her designers [[trolling]] Vocaloid fans. Eventually, when the Vocaloid community realized [[YHBT|they had been trolled]], they got over the fact they had been lead along and began the masturbation-initiation ritual for her. Having written her personality, arbitrarily deciding that she is a chimera and has a love of french loaf, they began work on producing songs and music videos starring her, giving her the full Vocaloid treatment.

The bulk of her songs are {{youtube|fmN91lLmrvo|covers of Miku's songs}}, or {{youtube|AiE-2TY0Pew|original songs about her wanting to be a real Vocaloid}}. The shtick is as annoying as it sounds.

{{clear}}

===Sonika===
[[File:Sonika.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Sonic the Hedgehog|Sonika and the Secret Sings]].]]
Sonika is probably the least popular Vocaloid, because she can't fucking sing to save her shit. {{youtube|p8T8AhaaDR0|At}} {{youtube|WDPgPzCNGkc|all.}} She still has a small number of fans though, and they bitch over if her "character item" should be a gold ring ''(Because of [[Sonic]])'', a [[Goonswarm|pineapple]] ''(Because her color scheme resembles one)'', or a bell ''(Due to one of her abysmal original songs, {{youtube|eMgFu1S746Q|"Ring my bell"}}''. She can sing in both English and Japanese, which boosts her appeal to the [[Japanese]] as well as the [[Weeaboo|"Japanese at heart"]].

Fans still bitch that her looks do not match her soft voice. The original design team still swim in pools of their own profits. Put it together, and you do not have a recipe for [[Obama|change]].

{{clear}}

===[[Ecstasy AKA Darks]] AKA [[Weeaboo|Zetsuchoukan Yami]]===

No, really.  Some fangirl made an UTAU of herself using [[Original character|an old 4chan meme]] as a base.  His character item is a "[[Facepalm|yaoi paddle]]".

{{clear}}

===[[T-Pain]]===
T-Pain might as well be a Vocaloid. He is the closest thing to Miku Hatsune [[irl]].

{{clear}}

==Songs / Music Videos==

===Official===

As mentioned before, Vocaloid is marketed as a music-making tool ''(The key word being "Marketed", as it's [[hentai|true purpose]] is [[Obvious|already well-established]])''. Somehow, between the marathon fap sessions and day-dreaming of [[Love|romance]], [[music]] and accompanying [[AMV|music videos]] are actually made. Here for your [[Fap|viewing pleasure]] is a selection of some of the more popular videos. If you enjoy these videos, congratulations: You are officially a [[weeaboo]]! You'll receive your [[Lonely|anime body pillow]] and [[Fullmetal Alchemist|the latest L'Arc-en-Ciel album]] by mail shortly.

Some people actually make un-official Vocaloid songs based off of actual songs...

===Fandubs===

Don't even ask me the fucking point of creating a program to sing songs in a female voice if there are actual females willing to sing shit themselves. Oh, wait: It's because [[Truth|the only girls willing to sing this shit sound fucking terrible]]. [[Misogyny]], you say? View the videos below and see, er, suffer for yourself.

===Parodies===

There are some who recognize how ridiculous the popularity of Vocaloid has become, and who have taken it upon themselves to [[troll]] the weeaboo fanfaggots.

==Fan Base==
The fanbase is made up of the most vile weaboos one could ever imagine. Their general, severe lack of intelligence (and inability to fucking hear anything) is one way to spot them from the other [[Inuyasha|weaboos]]. Many of the fanfaggots enjoy making their [[Mary Sue|own 'original' characters]] and singing badly, using these as porn for you to try and fap to (if you can tolerate their prepubescent chorus-of-squirrel voices). To see a cluster of these Vocaloid loving peons in action, please see the monumental cesspool called the [[Fail|Vocaloid Otaku Network]]. This is essentially the hub for everything Vocaloid [[Weaboo|(and Touhou for some reason)]]. It is the perfect place for you if you happen to suffer from [[butthurt|Autism]] or [[AIDS|ADHD]] and have an interest in trite garbage that's even reviled in Japan. If you dare try to critique this shithole on another completly different website, you will make the [[Transsexual|glorious moderators]] very [[Chris Crocker|butthurt]]. See an example here!
