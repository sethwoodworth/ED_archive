__NOTOC__
The '''AuroraFurries''' are, simply put, a bunch of [[furries]] who dump [[yiff]] on [[/b/]]. The target of many [[trolls]] and [[sage]] attempting to make a name for themselves and become Internet famous, but little do they know the Aurorafurries are not even recognized by most 4channers, or [[4chan]] related groups. In fact this is [[Shit_that_nobody_cares_about|shit that nobody cares about but them.]]

==How to Join Them==

[[Image:AuroraFurriesObvious.jpg|thumb|right|To unjoin, just point out the obvious.]]
*Download a torrent of furry porn, dump it everywhere and one will fap to your threads. In turn, you will instantly be a member and will know all of their [[Wikileaks|seekrets]]! Start ranting about how you feel you are actually a wolf inside a human body for extra lulz; you will be promoted to Fuhrer, or something, because you're actually a furry, and they aren't! Also quit your job, dump your girlfriend - pick up a new shiny boyfriend so you can share and cherish all of your tender sensitive furnigger moments with (Dont worry, they will help you find one if you are in need).


=Objective=

The like all [[furry]] groups,  the lack of a clear goal limits anything productive or useful that could ever come out of the group. Their reason for existence has been everything from simply posting [[yiff]] in turn fighting anti-furry groups by... apparently... posting more content for them to fight, dumping porn for [[fail|reason of nothing better to do]], to trolling [sage]s. Any real question like "Why do you do this" or "Why do you just dump porn?" usually interrupts thier rather otherwise [[good|bad]] day.

{{quote|Our purpose is to provide [[prostitution|a service to ourselves and others.]] It goes beyond simply spreading and sharing [[kittens|yiff]] for us all to [[eyebleach|enjoy]], [[lie|but also building a community for those furs who do not fit the stereotype]]. This is a place where you don't have to be embarrassed about being a furry. That's what we are all about| Jay trying to justify the group's purpose to newcomers.}}


==The drama on ED==

An article plagued by furniggery, constant edits, poor grammar, the inability to count, and various other lulzy deeds. Aurorafurries declares itself "Not posting on /b/ anymore" yet they still do, just by denying it because they have clearly lost the page's edit war and get called "sociopathic pedofiles" by every sage that happpens across thier shit dumps. *cough*... Ex-shit dumps, ReCaptcha > furfags.


=Changing Identities=

A while back, Aurorafurries copypasta'd the article of themselves, deleted half of it and changed the names of those involved in hopes of getting a new identity. Protip furfags: Keeping the same wording and imagery does not work.

All of the members have since changed their aliases to other shit(Most pre-existing names that they were thinking of using)


==The Owners==

The elite members of the Aurorafurries are referred to as "the owners" of the group. This stems from the moderation ranks in their chat service. The owners are the retarded epileptic head of the Aurorafurries who control how things work. Most of the owners are straight with the exceptions being Trapper, the owner Serpentor promoted when he ragequit, and Marker, the newest chink.

*'''Serpentor:''' Founder and [[ragequit|former]] leader of the Aurorafurries. If it was not for this G.I. Joe obsessed furfag then all this mess would have never happened. He loved doing everything in secret, even if it was not efficient. He didnt want the group to part ways into what was planned to be "aurorafurries V2" Aka. "Those Fucking Furries" because he would lose his personal army, so he quickly undid the work of Jay and gave ownership to Trapper. It is likely he has changed his name and is still within the group, never relinquishing control.

*'''Jay:''' The oldest member, and inventor of the [[circle jerk|furfags]] of a group, Jay has administrative rights on both the group's chat and website, but has absolute control over nether. The idea running around the community is that the former leader and founder of the Aurorafurries; Serpentor, appointed him before abandoning the furs. As a result, Jay is at constant ends with Trapper who is the head administrator (or main owner in Xatfag terms) The resulting arguments are often carried out in front of everyone, one of the popular forms of entertainment among new and old members alike. Jay is very opinionated and will take part in any political or social discussion he sees. This is excellent for trolling, but you must be careful, since once he recognizes your purpose he will put on his srs bsns hat and probably ban you. His bans are usually undone by Trapper after the victims complain Jay is being a Nazi, even if it is a fair an legitimate ban. Jay is also known in the chat for having a shitty laptop, resulting in him using his iPhone for most of his time online. He works on airplanes... shwooosh. He is also the main reason for the group losing members and almost breaking apart(twice), a eternity-old set of spies being uncovered and a shitstorm of lulz and hate resulting in the dox of a moderator of [[IB4F]].

*'''Trapper:''' The main owner of the Aurorafurries' pathetic flash based chat room. Trapper enjoys cybering with young boys, and shocking new members with his twisted furry porn. Trapper will, and has, fapped to everything other then scat and cat gore. (But it is prophesied that he will fap to the former one day.) He is particularly sensitive about the latter and has been known to ban members for even mentioning it. The [[Nazi|German]] also claims to be bipolar. The purpose of this is no doubt to make people feel sorry for him, and give him a e-blowjob. Trapper can be found lurking Lulz.net 24/7 with the exception of the time he takes out to post pictures of his very small bent penis on /b/. The constant feud between Trapper and Jay is often filed by their conflicting values. Trapper believes that everyone should get a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance, and however many more they need to stay in the group.

*''''Millenia''' A member who has caused the group nothing but unneeded stress and doubt but who still happily idles in the Aurorafurries chat day in and day out notably Millenia is a true nigra; idles in their chat secretly spying on them, while making smilies. The only notable violation of this chain is when he/she posts with them in raids, usually taking form of an anime character and using [[Tor]].

{{quote|Everytime you enterd the Chat ... i felt sick .... it feels a bit better now.|Trapper|Marforius(See below) did this to him}}

*'''Filthy:''' The head administrator of U-18chan, the group's home site, is not seen around the chat room much since he is mostly busy tracing porn(Abitfur4u). Filthy is also notorious for posting pictures of his womanly ass every chance he gets. In addition to his fetish for fur, Filthy also gets off on pictures of trains, and flowers.

{{quote|I got so horny I wanted to fuck this flower|Filthy|Expressing his lust for floraporn}}

*'''Spud:''' Spud came in on the same boat as Filthy and Jay back during the group's creation. Spud is generally found talking either about computer hardware or pot during his time online. He claims to be from Scotland, but you wouldn’t know it from the twelve or so time zones he seems to live in.

*'''Marker:''' One of the new(er) members of the group, this chink came in obviously recruited the same way that the group recruits everyone. Instantly promoted to "owner" and thought himself a [[southpark|very big penis]] he speaks surprisingly good engrish but still needs to work on his grammer. When he tries to troll you it usually sounds like "we need to get him" or the best "why u do this".

*'''Anu:''' The Aurorafurries secret owner/programmer, Anu is rarely spoken of and never seen. So much so that nearly no one in the group is aware of his existence. The owners all know him, some kid going to school for programming. He made a few dumpers for their shitty porn, he does hardly anything else for them. Is also very afraid of putting his password or email in plaintext.

Due to recent drama between Trapper and Jay, all the owners are main owners, and the two hate each other more then ever.

==The Sagers==

<center>[http://xat.com/web_gear/chat/inappropriate.php?GroupName=Aurora_Furries Click this and fill out some generic truth about furries to get them B&]</center>
<center> ''ED got them taken down on a completely unmoderated chat service one time so far, keep up the good work ED men'' </center>

The enemies of the Aurorafurries are often as bad as the furries themselves. The term "sager" is used by the furs as a general term for all enemies of the group who sage their furry threads on /b/. Most of the sages troll on the side as well. Note, that most of them use characters from videogames or kids shows as their names and sage material.

*'''Jack Spicer:''' Arguably one of the main reasons for the creation of the Aurorafurries. Jack was at one time synonymous with fur threads on /b/ due to his consistent sage bombings. Spicer was most likely several anons rather than just one. The particular Jack Spicer involved with the Aurorafurries hailed from the very same site the group formed on, Aurorachan. Post-creation he was rarely involved though, choosing to stick with his RP friends. He is no longer involved whatsoever.

*'''Dojo:''' An Australian college student working in the field of biomechanics and with a part time job at an insurance agency, Dojo was the Aurorafurries' favorite rival. If it were not for him, the group would not have grown as it did. Their attempts to raid Dojo were not only on 4chan, but also 711chan, 888chan, Paws.ru, Aurorachan, and U-18chan. This sager's career went down hill when he became the group's pet. He would be luered into the chat for the fur's entertainment under the impression that he was trolling. Dojo was infamous for preaching about how suck and wrong furries were, and strongly encouraged furries to seek medical help. He frequently stressed that he was trying to help furries become better people among much other moralfaggotry, which is lulzy since it was quite obvious he was a closet fur. After having all of 888chan turn on him do to some furry spyops Dojo began to lay low for a while, but this was not enough for the Aurorafurries. They quickly performed a finishing move in the form of an email sent to his place of work explaining that an employee at that location had been posting inappropriate and graphic content on an adult site using the companies’ IP. Since then Dojo has only been spotted twice on 4chan, but not on /b/, and upon spoting an Aurorafurry posting he immediately left. The last anyone has hear of the former sager was an email to his sage friends stating that he was still alive a few months after he disappeared. Speculation says he is busy trying to find a new job. Later, it was revealed that Dojo was possibly three different friends who all used the same name and tripcode.

<center>He couldn't compose a question let alone answer a question if he was asking one already. A godly troll, [[srsly]].</center>

{{Quote|for 14(Two weeks) days I set out on a search, going on Anthrochat and [[FurAffinity]], and among other sites, to see if [[Furries]] are really as bad as people say.
The only reason I really did this, is because I’m extremely curious, [[Fuckin Magnets|I’ve pulled all the locks in my house apart just to see how they work]], I’m currently studying maths and science, (Chemistry and Physics) and I will soon be on my way to a degree in civil engineering, which seems to be right up my alley.|Dojo's [[Doing it wrong|trolling]].}}


<center>He followed these fags around everywhere, devoting what looks to be like [[At least 100|at least 100]] years of his life to saging them.</center>

*'''Antz, Scout:''' Two of Dojo's lesser minions, these closet furs posted pictures of Mishu from Malan and the scout from Team Fortress 2 as apposed to Dojo's Xalmain Showdown dragon. The two disbanded after Dojo disappeared.

*'''HAZMAT:''' Posting pictures of hazmat suits got boring for this closet fur after Dojo left him and the other sagers on their own. One day, while saging a fur thread, the yiff got to him and he flipped sides. HAZMAT is now a stable member of the Aurorafurries.

*'''A.T.:''' He has no ability to sage bomb threads, but he is the only one who can actualy troll. He has gotten the best of nearly every furry he has crossed at some point. Unfortunately, the weeaboo spends what time he has on the Internet lurking Lulz.net and only shows up to troll the Aurorafurries once in a blue moon. The relationship between A.T. and the furry group is odd, since most of them get exited when they see A.T. around and do whatever they can to get him to stick around. This could perhaps be because he is the last of the original sagers who prompted the creation of their group.

*'''Youmustdie:''' Some anonymous faggot who sage bombed furry threads and posted numerous personal army requests on /b/ ([[X is not your personal army|To whom nobody gave a shit]]), but also more effectively, spammed the threads with links to the Aurora chat room, causing it to fill with newfag /b/tards causing substantial lulz.


==Enemies==

In the past, Aurorafurries have been hit hard by certain people who have raised their paranoia levels through the roof today, you can be expected to be banned immediately if you join their Xat.


==='''[[User:Marforius|Marforius]]'''===

None would have expected a cocky "fat asian jew nigger" would attempt to bring the group down from the inside. The Aurorafurries certainly didn't, [[winrar|and he certainly succeeded.]] He got the group's most coveted program(from Jay), turned it into fear that 4chan would patch the exploits the programs were using after releasing them for the world to use, made serpentor leave, banned trapper in a fit of lulz, banned all the other members in a fit of lulz, had the best night of his life learning they had doxed someone else in his place from Toronto(Canada) another from Carolina, and another! from California, dumped thier IPs, emails, passwords, and more from [[IB4F] - including everything they had ever posted! Then shutdown thier chan for a night! WHOO!

After being kicked out of the Patriotic Nigras, this [[Jew]] found out about the infamous group known as the Aurorafurries, thanks to their [[sad|continuous posting]] of gay furry threads. After trolling all the users of their Xat for a few months in between school and [[warcraft]],[[HA HA HA, OH WOW|Marforius actually became a group admin]]. Then later becoming an [[IB4F]] admin and trolling/doxing the group [[IB4F]] and everyone at one time related to the group.

Marforius even attempted the impossible and convinced the furfags to get on IRC. This soon failed, as they were too retarded to even find a client and were stuck with using Mibbit, or because they didn't know how to [[get in irc fgt]], or claimed "Xat's better because it's in a [[Firefox|browser]]!!!11". 

After [[psyops|psyopping]] for so long, Marforius eventually left the group and created this very ED article which Aurorafaggots watch on a hourly basis(Also taking credit for writing when they troll and this is brought up). He currently resides with ArcEmu, a [[world of warcraft]] emulator. Doxing and trolling many of the jew children that want to get donations for private servers while doing nothing. (tl;dr not getting anything done still).


==='''[[User:Fiskie|Fiskie]]'''===

Originally, just a furry /b/tard with an obsession of memes, Fiskie turned to Marforius' side after many [[yiff|textfucking|]] sessions to get back at the furs for their constant ridicule. Fiskie was once banned for an argument with Jay over the lyrics to ''White Wedding'' by Billy Idol. Jay, still irradiated from USI, removed Fiskie from the chat then eventually banned him ''[[what|over an argument about song lyrics]]''. Later that day, Fiskie was forced to make an apology on the group's site containing the correct lyrics to ''White Wedding'' to make sure Jay would [[STFU]]. The [[troll|cute]] post was too much for the owners to ignore and he was let back in.

Later on, when Marforius created this article, Fiskie realised the amount of [[buttsex|potential]] he was losing from being in a group that didn't even know how to [[IRC]] and quickly started to contribute to the article in favor of Marforius, eventually getting [[b&]] from Aurorafurries [[IP ban|fo' lyf]] and moved on to be a [[faggot|furry EDiot]]. Fiskie has since then [[psyops|psyopped]] himself into the group again at least four times for doxing purposes. In result, he saw [[pedophiles|Aurorafurries]] asking a [[13-year-old boy]] for pictures of his [[cock|dick]] in their own Xat channel. lulz were ensued from this.

According to Aurorafurries, Fiskie is a [[16-year-old girl]] living in [[Canada|Toronto]] approxamatly 2-3 blocks away from Marforius. Also that they play xbox and drink "nattie-ice" and call eachother "bro-niggers" every two-three weeks ([[srsly]])

{{quote|Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!|Fiskie| pissing off furfags like a pro}}


==AuroraChan==

AuroraFurries name is a runoff from this chan's /fur/ board, where a bunch of retarded [[weeaboo]] [[furfag]] scientists thought it would be smart to put "Fur" after Aurora, proving how [[intelligent|smart]] [[furfags]] [[not|are]]. (Aurora, by the way, means dawn in greek.)In recent days this board has completely died off, they moved to u-18chan after a fight with the owner of the site over the instability of the group, and the fact that they were not completly into [[anime]] like his [[weeaboo]] self was.


==U-18chan==

Ran by the eldest founder of the group, Filthy. Filthy's [[Fursona]] is a Fennic or whatever he feels like he should be at the time, with an anorexic body don't be fooled, from behind its toothpick body lies a trap.. he also draws trace overs under the name "abitfur4u" horribly, they look like they were done with... '''CRAYON + MICHAEL J. FOX''' not demeaning that all furry porn isn't [[srsly]]. He left the group in search for better endeavors one time, oddly around the same time as the groups [[E-fame|epeen]] was destroyed. They have moved to another "new" website owned partly by "Kittheshit".

</gallery>
He has tons more of this crap on his website and [[e621]] now.
</center>


==Raids== 

All of their raids on chans come up short. Not a single one has been ever been successful in what they imply they do.

<center><gallery>

</gallery></center>

*'''[[888chan]]:''' - Raided with furry and pushed all the posts out one by one with about 6 furries.
Quickly banned. hit again with a few drama posts, instant b&.
When a thread was made to raid them, they promptly sicked their pro psyops nigger on them with 7 proxies to mess with their minds until R3X said "NO CHANH ON CHAN RAIDS," and deleted the 200+ post thread. Attacks by recent front groups like AuroraFurries have caused r3x, to move to a different server, showing him how easy it would be for [[Scientologists|Scilons]] to sap his sentries he promptly got to work on securing things. (of course he didn't read the part of the article where nigger and psyops was mentioned.)
*'''[[7chan]]:''' Flooded with [[yiff]], every thread on /int/ was 404ed before the furries were banned and [[7chan]] launched a counter attack on U-18chan.
*'''[[4chan]]:''' Threads created on a daily basis using their tripcodes.
Every Friday they create threads and arrange themselves orderly in their war room to coordinate using their dumpers.
*'''[[1chan]]:''' Flooded with yiff every once in a blue moon.

They would achieve the same effect if they linked a thread in their main chat and said "hit it" but they have to be like every furfag community online and do this in [[FBI|seekret]] in their "War Room" of course upon release of this article many furry feet were burned in hell so they had to relocate it to a even more remote, seekret location.

That's cool n' shit [[No|amirite]]? Posting a link to this article causes lulz to ensure in their threads, their newfag gratification is instantly ruined and they realize that they are the cancer all these people talk of.

'''''DO THEY HAVE JOBS???'''''

==Counter Raids==

When raided they got behind their chan; U-18chan, and buckled down for the rough seas, turning off their pathetic excuse for [[IRC|flash IRC]] and banning everyone that posted for the next 24 hours. They then had nerve enough to celebrate their victory and fap to more porn.


==Useful Programs that Came Out of this Group==

Somewhere along the line these [[furries]] raped a negro scientist, causing him to turn [[furry]] and create their dumper programs for them.
These are to be handled with extreme caution as, if they are combined with [[sage]] they immediately undo what these [[furries]] have attempted.
These are probably better than X-chan or any dumper on the market. These programs are now broken with the new changes applied to [[4chan]], a huge bump in the road with moot supposedly making post forms have a dynamic number generator to stop future dumpers from working - however they do still work for all the crappy chans spread out on the internet. It is common fact that using this program is the equivalent of sucking a furries [[penis|cock]]. Which, if done,[[Yiff in Hell|will send you to hell's fire.]]

===AuroraDumper===

It supports dumping in sections, configurable comments, dumping to any board/chan possible, cookie configuration, and a ton of shit that makes this the obvious superior tool to XChan. For the predefined boards to work that have been included they must be in the ROOT directory of the dumper. '''The same place as the .exe'''
*[http://www.mediafire.com/?nzzwjngeymz]


===SingleDumper===

A buggy piece of [[computer science|C++]] shit that only posts to boards on [[4chan]] (and possibly other chans if you redirect [[4chan]] through your hosts file), this thing is so powerful it "rolls" posts as it goes along deleting previous images and posting new ones to evade the image post limit.
Say a thread you make is saged heavily? Well worry no more; this baby will delete your previously posted images and keep posting images, causing confusion and frustration among trolls with the infamous "OMG THREAD WAS IMAGED CAPPED" response.
*[http://www.mediafire.com/?nm3qzioyg2n]

The causing downfall and lulz that ensued over these too supposedly secret programs is more then lulzy following the time that these programs were released a whole shitstorm of sodomized furs turning their heads and looking over at the spy that relayed this information. The said spy goes by the name of Marforius and wasted three weeks of his life '''not originally writing himself into the article''' but was forced to anyway. See more at [[Talk:AuroraFurries|The talk page for this article]]

{{quote|So, back with all that shit with The FF and whatnot, I one day decided the members present had been very dedicated and deserved a treat. I gave them the dumper, and during that time Marforius was present, although he seemed to e AFK. At the time I had no idea of Marforius' intentions, and all the memers who got the dumper are now in The FF IC, I won't name names though. I realise that there is no exuse for what I did, and I ask for no sympathy, but instead hope for forgiveness. I have learned from my mistake, as I always try to do, and hope you guise can see that. I appologise and take full responsibility for the dumper being spread, and am lucky 4chan changed their server. Still, it is very unfortunate that I had to go and fuck up on such a large scale. It feels good to get this off my chest, because as I said I have been hiding this for way to long, I feel bad about it. I also feel a little good though, since I now have this weight off my chest, so to speek. I hope I can prove to all of you my sincerity in my appology, not just for what I did, but for the time it took to come out with the truth. I also thank Anu very much for squeezing it out of me.|Jay|}}

Spelling errors and shit aside, it was given to said troll without anyone else being present via private message. This is now the current leader of the group, still, oh so still trying to grasp his last edge of leadership before the [[asspie]], Trapper takes it away.


{{quote|Oh snap marf I have a present for you!... sec while I ask anu for it lol i lost it on my laptop in the shop| Jay | moments before giving Marforius the dumpers}}   


== The drama on ED ==

An article plagued by furniggery, constant edits, poor grammar, the inability to count, and various other lulzy deeds. Aurorafurries declares itself "Not posting on /b/ anymore" yet they still do, just by denying it's because they have clearly lost the page's edit war and got called "sociopathic pedofiles" by every sage that happpens across their shit dumps. *cough*... Ex-shit dumps, ReCaptcha > furfags.


==OH GOD THEY ROLEPLAYED TOO?==

Pools closed 

When an influx of members started complaining about them [[roleplaying]] gay situations and playing "house" in the main chat, AuroraFurries knew what they had to do and started up a [[gay]] roleplay chat. Its usually filled with descriptions of events that would make even the most hard pipe hitting nigger immediately think [[WTF|WHAT THE FUCK AM I READING?]]. This chatroom is used mainly for the purpose of [[role-playing|yiffing]] as the name implies and is used most commonly by the furry named Wrath. This user has been [[Over_9000|over 9000]] different kinds of species and genders that it has lost all memory of what it use to be. Proof circulates this user is a [[fat]] [[virgin|virgin furry]] that dwells in the basement and spends most of his time fapping to sonic and [[rita|Rita]] [[porn|pr0n]]. The typefucking room has been abandoned since they lost most of their green members that helped fill it, Wrath left too.

The most common activity within in any of their chats is being a retard. As they don't have to put any effort into it [[srsly|it comes quite naturally to them.]]
They seem to have risen on an [[IRC]] network underneath two names to resurrect their chats. irc.rizon.net's #AuroraFF and #Aurorayiff both are under +S(secret mode) and they think that grants them so much protection on [[IRC]].
