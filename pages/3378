'''God of War''' is a popular series of [[video game]]s and in which a large, [[Goth|pale]], [[steroids|roid-raged]] guy from [[TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL|Sparta]] goes around [[Grand Theft Auto|killing everything in sight and sexing up bitches]], all whilst talking in [[ALL CAPS]] and being a general [[Internet tough guy|tough guy]]. Not only that, but he spouts several over-used and [[lame]] [[meme]]s and [[Quasidan's penis|in jokes]] to [[trying too hard|try and be funny]] (like you read in the first two lines of this article) but [[fail]]s miserably. 

It is [[Sony]]'s answer to the much more popular [[Legend of Zelda]] series, except that God of War has an actual plot to it. This, however, is [[moot]] because [[fairy|faeries]] and [[fag]]s dressed in green tights can never be replaced by half naked baldy men [[slash]]ing mythical creatures to [[shit]]. The games' [[guro|gore factor]] is a lot higher then your [[typical]] hack 'n slash series, and [[Nintendo]] [[fanboy]]s wish it would be ported over to the [[Wii]] so they can use [[masturbation|waggle technology]] to slash faggots with their [[Final Fantasy 7|megablades]].

==Main Characters==
There are [[over 9000|far too many characters]] in God of War to count. Here is a list of only the main characters that recur throughout the series and why they are of great importance.

'''[[Leonidas|Kratos]]''' - A rather [[bodybuilder|buff]] and athletic [[Don Henrie|pasty cunt who has not seen the sun in years]]. He wears absolutely nothing [[caveman|but a cloth to cover up his miniscule penis and dirty arse crack]]. Fans tend to [[Wet and Messy Fetishism|wet themselves over this]] as they love watching Kratos' thick, muscular legs whilst he's escaping from a pack of wild [[horse|minotaurs]]. As evidenced, it is clear [[twisted sexual acts|he likes to smear the blood of his victims over his body in a twisted act of sexual release]]. [[Some argue|Some will argue]] this is actually just war paint, but it's just to cover up Sony's [[sickfuck]]ery. He was [[owned|tricked by the god Ares into killing his own family]]. [[Lulz]]. Also, despite being a pasty, white cunt, he has a rather deep black person voice.

'''[[Hathor the Cow Goddess|Goddess Athena]]''' - The goddess of [[hippy|peace]] and [[wise beard man|wisdom]]. She also happens to be a [[virgin]]. She is in charge of [[Greek|Athens]] and is ultimately Kratos' [[bitch]]. She convinces Kratos to destroy the God of War Ares' army (the same one who tricked him into killing his family). When Kratos tries to suicide off a cliff she saves him and tells him that he can be the new God of War, but really she wants Kratos' dick but is too much of a [[pussy]] to ask him. Ends up getting killed by Kratos. Then ,surprise!, comes back as ghost

'''[[Al Gore|God Zeus]]''' - The main [[final boss|antagonist]] of the series. He is the God of [[lightning bolt|thunder and the sky]] and is ruler of all the other Gods. He betrays Kratos and guess what? Holy shit he's his father!! That's just in case you managed to get by the [[spoiler]] at the top. He is in charge of [[Brokeback Mountain|Mount Olympus]] and is leading a constant battle between the [[Goku|Gods]] and [[Superman|Titans]]. When Kratos tries to kill him, Athena jumps in the way [[for great justice]] and saves him.

'''[[Gaia]]''' - Kratos' very own pet [[Gaiafag]]. She is the [[mother]] of the Titans and is the Goddess of the [[Earth]]. She was banished by Zeus when she refused to [[cocksucker|suck his cock]] during [[WW2|The Gr√¶t War]]. She and the other Titans side with Kratos as he attempts to inflict [[ownage]] on Zeus and all of Mount Olympus. Although the third game hasn't been made yet, we suspect she will be killed in the conflict to add [[drama]] and [[lulz]] to the series. Yeah she is killed.

==God of War plot==
[[Image:UltimateBattle.jpg|thumb|Your typical gameplay involves Arabs fighting giant [[furries]].]]

The plot of the series can be much better described as a fractional '[[Disney|Hercules]] meets [[300]]' rip-off. The first game begins with Kratos just before he is about to [[an hero]]. We are then [[time travel|taken back in time]] and it is revealed Kratos was tricked into killing his family. He then goes on a mission to kill the [[faggot]] who did it (The God of War Ares). Kratos then [[cliche|enters a temple by crawling into a titan's ass and solves numerous puzzles to retrieve an item]] known as '[[goatse|Pandora's Box]]' (oh, like in [[Legend of Zelda]]??) After retrieving the box, Ares sends a swarm of [[AIDS|herpies]] to kill Kratos and take the box.

[[But you are died!|Now that Kratos are died]], he descends into the [[Australia|Underworld]] and is seemingly trapped there forever. But Kratos won't have that, so he proceeds to kill and destroy every [[zombie|dead creature]] he sees. He fights his way to the top of the Underworld and eventually finds a [[portal]] that [[mindfuck|takes him back to the real world]], alive and well. Now he's really pissed, and tracks down Ares so that he [[buttsex|can fuck him up]].

Kratos then retrieves the box from Ares and [[Goatse|opens it up wide]]. [[Sony Defense Force|The forces]] that are unleashed cause Kratos to grow to a preposterous size until he is equal to Ares. Basically what you get to see now is a huge [[Japanese]] [[Godzilla]]-esque [[giant]] [[monster]] battle between two super powers. After Kratos gains the upper hand, Ares uses a [[pussy]] tactic and traps him in an alternate dimension (like in [[Legend of Zelda]] again??) where an illusion of his family is. Ares kills this illusion to torment Kratos even [[moar]] and brings him back to the real world, and takes his weapons and [[magic]] away from him. Upon doing so, Kratos finds a giant fucking sword that appeared out of nowhere and fucks Ares up, eventually killing him.

The flashbacks end and the story catches up with the present. Athena tells Kratos that the [[meatspin|horrible nightmares he has of his family]] cannot be gotten rid of. This prompts Kratos to become [[emo]], and then he tries to kill himself (as seen at the start of the game). After he jumps, Athena saves him and brings him to Zeus, who offers to make him the new God of War in return for [[fellatio|fellating him]]. This brings the first game to an end.

==God of War II plot==
[[Image:God of war rule 34 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rule 34|Kratos bravely slaying Nariko]] with his mighty [[cock|sword]].]]
[[Image:God of war rule 34 02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[sex|struggle]] continues as Kratos [[fuck|tries to subdue]] [[slut|Nariko]].]]
[[Image:God of war rule 34 03.jpg|thumb|right|Kratos is at last [[ejaculation|triumphant and has slain Nariko]].]]
Several months after the first game, Kratos is the established new God of war, which causes him to suffer from much [[unwarranted self importance]]. This self importance causes him to lead massive attacks on the other [[Greek]] city-states. The other Gods [[I am disappoint|are not amused]] at all by this and reject Kratos, making him an [[dork|outcast]]. He continues conquering most of Greece with his army of Spartans. When he decides to take [[Rainbow Road|Rhodes]], an [[American]] [[CAPS EAGLE|eagle]] somehow [[fail|manages to rob him of his God powers]] and puts them inside of a giant [[metal]] [[epic fat guy|collosus]]. Zeus comes in to save the day and gives him a magical sword which he uses to defeat it. Then, in a [[delicious]] act of [[irony]], the giant metal [[robot]]'s hand falls on Kratos and wrecks his shit. He tries to crawl to his sword which will restore him back to [[only 2 percent|full power]]. But then....

[[Oh noes|Le gasp]]! It turns out that the eagle is actually [[troll|Zeus]]! Zeus betrayed him, in order to save Mount Olympus from certain [[doom]]. Zeus then insists Kratos ends his [[faggotry]] lest he be smacked with the [[perma-ban]] [[banhammer]] and be kicked out of [[life]]. Kratos refuses, and Zeus kills him. Just as Kratos is getting pulled into the [[asshole|Underworld]] (again) he is saved by a Gaiafag who then gives him a magical horse named 'Pegasus' (like in Hercules??) which he uses for transportation and [[buttsex]]. Kratos then embarks on a [[tl;dr|tl;dp]] journey to reach a bunch of [[lesbian]] [[incest|sisters]] known as the 'Moirae' who control the fate of every God and mortal with a fucking loom.

During this journey, Kratos fights a variety of monsters like [[Azn|Typhon]], [[Gimp|Theseus]], the [[Kraken]] and a billion other rehashed [[myth|mythological]] Greek monsters that you've seen countless times before on [[Disney|Disney's Hercules]]. When he arrives at the three sisters lair, they engage in an [[orgy|epic battle]] that is [[what|so confusing I cannot even bring myself to begin explaining what happens in it]]. After all the [[1980s|time travel]], mirror [[trick]]s and retarded summoning spells are over, Kratos defeats the three sisters and takes their loom. He then does some more time travel and fights Zeus. After stabbing him in the guts, Athena arrives on the scene. Kratos uses a [[shoop da whoop|magic spell]] to finish off Zeus but Athena jumps in the way, saving Zeus and becoming a candidate for the [[Golden iPod]] in 2007. Zeus escapes to Mount Olympus, and Athena tells Kratos that Zeus is his father (oh, [[Star Wars|where have I seen that before]]?) This causes Kratos to suffer more [[rage]].

[[Redundant|Kratos goes back in time (once more)]] and gets all the Titans who were killed in The Great War and brings them back to the present. He then leads them to Mount Olympus where they start scaling it to reach the temple at the top. [[Homo|Zeus]], [[Quasidan|Poseidon]], [[Futurama|Hermes]], [[Satan|Hades]] and Apollo all align together to defend their precious mountain. Then the faggots at [[Sony]] leave [[the game]] at a cliffhanger, almost guaranteeing that every GoW fanboy will buy the [[Electric Boogaloo|third game]] to see what happens next.

==God of War III==
God of War III was first announced [[last Thursday]] at E3 [[2008]]. As you would expect, it'll most likely continue the cliched Greek mythology story-telling that media such as books, [[video games]], [[television]] and [[movie]]s have exploited oh so well. You can expect [[do not want|90% more Hercules and 60% less Sparta]] (because Zeus killed most of them in the second game). For [[trolling]], go onto any gaming forum and say God of War 3 will [[fail|flop]]. You'll immediately be bombarded with a [[shitstorm]] of [[flame]]s.

==Critical Reception==
Like most [[Playstation]] games, the God of War series has garnered much success and critical acclaim from [[IGN]], [[Gamespot]], [[Jeff Gerstmann]], [[Gamespy]], [[GameFAQs]] and [[1up.com]] most likely because [[truth|the CEO of Sony sucked their dicks]] and/or payed them off. [[Cow]]s (Sony fanboys) the world over are unanimous in that the God of War series is undoubtedly "the best ever". People should take this with a grain of salt, because Sonyfags say this about every Playstation franchise like [[Metal Gear Solid]], [[Final Fantasy]], [[furry|Crash Bandicoot]] and the ever popular [[Grand Theft Auto]] series (which like all playstation franchises, eventually got ported to the [[XBox]]).

Based off the success of the first two games, Cows believe God of War 3 will be bigger then [[Jesus]]' second [[cum|coming]]. They began spouting shit like '[[Engrish|AAAAE am confirmed]]!', '[[Nobody cares|If God of War 3 does not receive AAAAE I will eat my PS3's hardrive]]' and 'GoW 3 GotY!' (GotY and AAAAE are [[game]][[fag]] for 'Game of the Year' and '10/10 exclusive' respectively). Should God of War 3 get any lower then a 10/10 on all sites aforementioned in the above paragraph then the [[internets]] will most likely [[die|overload]] as the [[baw|bawwwwing]] is unleashed from the cows. You can tell that they are extremely [[homosexual]], as they cannot wait for another installment of seeing a [[not gay|bald, naked man]] running around like a faggot.

==Role in the Console Wars==
As usual, [[Microsoft]] and Sony fanboys are neck-and-neck with each other over whose [[Covini C6W|overpriced]], [[Quasidan's penis|oversized]] consoles with shitty gaming libraries is better. These endless [[flame wars|arguments]] are [[pointless]] because the [[Battletoads|greatest game of all time was already released 17 years ago]]. Nevertheless, the God of War series is another subject at the centre of these wars. Sonyfags will constantly be drawing comparisons between God of War and Legend of Zelda and an attempt to make them feel better about themselves because in reality they're all a bunch of fat fucking [[basement dweller]]s and who spend every hour of every day [[irony|defending the same companies that turned them into basement dwellers]] with their ultra [[1337]] gaming consoles.
