[[Neodrama]] is a [[Neopets]] forum. It was made [[last Thursday]] by a [[fat]] [[camwhore]] and a [[douche|douchey]] [[homosexual]]. Currently, its primary inhabitants are [[unfunny]] [[trolls]], [[College|college girls]], [[pedophiles]], [[aspies]] and [[What|Pakistanis with vitiligo]]. It's ranked [[Loser|18,667,706th]] on [[Alexa]]'s list of most popular websites and is considered one of the [[Lie|funniest]] and [[Stupid|most respected]] [[Neopets]] forums on the web.

== History ==

In [[Numa Numa|2006]], during the heyday of the [[USI|Battledome Chat]], the [[fag|legends]] of the forum decided they should branch off and form their own utopian community where they could spread lols and have fun, away from the Nazi-like Neopets [[moderators]]. They were sick and tired of the [[12 year old girl|Avatar Chat]] spreading their [[spam]] onto their [[Hypocrite|oh so heavenly board]]. Little did they realize that in the midst of all the [[Hacker|CGing]] and [[scam|scamming]] going on, Neopets players would eventually take notice and join the [[orgy|community]] known as Neodrama. Not surprisingly, very little drama of any importance goes on here. A typical day on the boards involves some [[Turk]] whining about how [[Truth|ugly Asians are]], [[Whore|college girls]] talking about [[cats]] and shit, and [[oldfags]] complaining how the BD chat [[BAWW|just isn't what it used to be]]. The board was intended to be for guys looking to hook up with [[Fat|hot girls who play Neopets]], but it ended up a huge disappointment when a few girls thought it would be a good idea to Jew. When this was found out, the community of [[Lie|highly-respected individuals]] known as the BD Chat was so disappointed, they decided to spend their hard-earned Neopoints on these girls. The girls became [[Loser|rich on Neopets]] and people who didn't frequent the forum wondered how they became so rich.[[Image:T50rhu.jpg|thumb|[[Srsly|Actual Neodrama member]].

== Present ==

As [[unfunny]] as it always was, it still is frequented by the [[Fag|same group of people]], except now, [[Loli|Avatar Chatters]] have taken their place in the community. Because they are [[Lie|cute]], the men instantly started to [[Fap|respect them]]. Some of these kids became mainstays in the Battledome Chat and are now just as elitist as the rest of them.

== Solution ==

This website is basically just another forum. It's nothing special, nothing worth joining. [[You]] would probably think it interesting, so you can go [http://neodrama.net here].
