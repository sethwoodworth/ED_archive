The epitome of [[America|American]] masculinity. These men thrust into the back roads, pound the dirt trails through hills and valleys, and split the savage lands with a good and stiff shove. Their only goal is to spread [[semen|white civilization]] into the [[buttsecks|muddy, dangerous wilds]]. Pushing their way through the plains, they [[masturbation|beat off]] Native American tribes, [[secks|struggle with]] each other daily, and follow their ambitions strenuously, with only their fellow cowboys for [[orgasm|relief]].

The Wild West is no place for softies. If you give your [[faggotry|love]] to a cowboy man, he's gonna [[rape|love]] you as hard as he can. [[Butthurt]] will ensue.

== Old Cowboy Song ==

Well there once was two cowboys all alone out on the trail.

And they discovered they can sleep with another male-

Now they're having gay sex.

Cowboy gay sex.

SODO-MAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

SODO-MAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

SODO-MAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Sodomy

And all that kinda shit you get on your TV.

<div id="example" style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black;">There's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas;

There's many a young boy who feels things he don't comprehend.

Well small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes,

No, small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.


Well I believe in my soul that inside every man there's a feminine,

And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear.

Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he does with his women,

But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.


Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other

What did you think those saddles and boots was about?

There's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels towards his
brother,

Inside every cowboy there's a lady who'd love to slip out.


Ten men for each woman was the rule way back when on the prairie,

And somehow those cowboys must have kept themselves warm late at night.

Cowboys are famous for getting riled up about fairies,

But I'll tell you the reason a big strong man gets so uptight:


Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other;

That's why they wear leather, and Levi's and belts buckled tight.

There's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels towards his
brother;

There's many a cowboy who's more like a lady at night.


Well there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper,

And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead:

When you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister

Don't mess with the lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head.


Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other;

Even though they take speed and drive pickups and shoot their big guns;

There's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels towards his
brother;

There's many a cowboy who keeps quiet about things he's done.</div>
