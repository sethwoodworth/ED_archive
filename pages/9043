The '''Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.''' is a supposedly non-profit charity located at '''39 Stillman Street, [[San Francisco]], [[California|CA]] 94107''' (Can't [[oversight]] this! [http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/cbs.aspx search for Wikimedia]), but is in fact a criminal front organization for a global [[terrorist]] [[conspiracy]] rivaling [[Al-Qaeda]], [[Scientology]], and the [[Illuminati]]. Although it is physically located in California, it is chartered under the laws of [[Florida]] for the purpose of [[tax]] fraud.

According to the [[Internet Watch Foundation]], the WMF has waged a campaign of terror across [[Web 2.0]]. Its leader, the outlaw war  Jimmy Wales, known to his [[Wikipedia Admin Gallery|fanatical followers]] as "[[Jimbo]]," have defrauded gullible donators for millions of dollars under the guise of helping a mysterious and likely fake "[[The child in Africa|child in Africa]]."

==Overview==
[[Image:Wikimedia Headquarters (reduced).jpg|thumb|WMF's offices, waiting to be [[WTC|attacked]] by fanatical members of the [[Wikipedia Review]].]]
As shown below, WMF (moar like [[WTF]], [[amirite]]?) is the [[mother]] of everything related to Jimbo Wales' cash cows and laundromats spawning a number of tentacles, such as: 

*Wikimedia Commons: where wikipedos keep all the multimedia files they have stolen from the internets throughout the years, which they call "free content" material.
*Wikiversity: Jimbo's attempt to infest [[college|academia]]. 
*Wikinews: just like [[Faux News]].  
*Wikibooks: allegedly a collection of free textbooks, available under the [[GFDL]] license. Wikibooks includes [[Childlove|Wikijunior]]. 
*Uncyclopedia: the ''magnum opus'' of boredom, [[stupidity]] and everything [[unfunny]].
*And other [[TOW|shit]].

*'''What is the mission of the Foundation ?'''

The mission of the WMF is to empower Jimbo Wales and his henchmen (particularly the [[Wikipedia Jews]] and oddly the [[Mormon]]s), by collecting [[NPOV|carefully chosen information]] under a [[lie|free content license]], and to disseminate it globally, according to the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].

*'''Is WMF a charity?'''
[[Oh noes]]. 

*'''Which projects do they support?'''

Jimbo Wales' washing machine [http://valleywag.com/362879/jimmy-waless-gold+plated-washing-machine].

[[Role-playing]] games

General racketeering

*'''Where does the money come from?'''

Through donations of [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_Releases/Khosla_Gift retarded philanthropists], who have no clue that Jimbo spends their money on whores and wine. [http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/wikipedia-head-accused-of-expenses-rort/2008/03/05/1204402516874.html] Oh, and also from, er, "private benefactors". [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Benefactors]

*'''Does WMF have audited financial statements?'''
Yes. Their auditor is KPMG. KPMG is the premier accounting firm when it comes to creating tax shelters and inventing the newest tax evasion schemes. They are currently facing thousands of lawsuits from investors, bankrupt corporations and state and local governments 

*'''Does WMF files a tax return?'''
Yes. KPMG prepares it. You can access their tax return for free at guidestar.org - just register and a minute later you will have a template to create a non-profit scam. To create a bank holding company and apply for TARP funding - visit fdic.gov - detailed instructions provided. If you are too lazy to register and see Wikimedia foundation's tax return - here is a summary of the most important details:

Revenue:             $6,500,000 (donations and the like)

Expenses:            $  250,000 (hosting costs)

Scam fees:           $1,500,000 (auditors fee to keep the scam going)

Profit for owners:   $3,750,000
 
Sue's salary:        $   50,000

Wikipedia's Admins:  $        0

Jimbo's salary:      $3,700,000

how do i add their tax returns here???? i have it in pdf file. i have never contributed to a wiki before - only vandalize.
