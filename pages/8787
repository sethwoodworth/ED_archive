Victim complex
'''Victim complex''' is a [[psychological]] [[disorder]] manifesting in both individuals and groups.  Once upon a time, Jew ethnic minority groups, suffering genuine persecution, had some cause to complain about the shitty state of affairs that said group was going through.  In modern times, of course, what with all the democratic freedoms we enjoy and the general lack of pogroms and gas chambers, [[furries|many]] [[feminazi|other]] [[christian|oppressed]] [[wiccans|groups]] have bravely spoken up about the terrifying ordeals they nobly endured, up to and including 'being looked at funny', 'being called nasty names', 'having their deviantART/LJ trolled'. 

In short, every idiotic group and [[fag|individual with a slight]] is nursing a complex about it. The truly desperate cultivate multiple complexes into an entire bundle wrapped up into deep seated psychosis.

The possessor of a victim complex needs some outside authority to blame for their own failures. They can never compensate for their personal challenges in order to do the basic competition necessary to be even minimally successful at life. Those with the most institutional of complexes have created not only an outside persecutor but feel an innate and deep [[penis|endowment]] for entitlement, even privilege. In many cases [[Fags|those with a victim complex]] have foisted their [[Christianity|delusions]] of [[white people|persecution]] onto [[nazi|others]] and convinced the supposed persecutor into another complex: [[liberal guilt]]. Those who are members of the class of people (supposedly) persecuting the victim who don't subscribe to liberal guilt are held up as examples of those who really ARE persecuting them which just reinforces the complex.

===[[Black People]]===
[[Image:1897McLoughlin10NIGGERScoverFEB23.jpg|left|75px|]]
The classic victim complex is that of the There are no black people on the Internet, which has no more merit because the white majority America elected Barack Obama President (on second thought, probably due to [[liberal guilt|white guilt]]). One hundred forty years after the end of slavery, a [[black]] man can evidence a victim complex by saying it is [[The Man]], especially the [[white people|white man]] (and the [[Good Korea|Korean]] grocery store owner down the street), for the failures of themselves as individuals and the entire race.  

Through multiple generations the majority black culture has devalued education, put ignorance on a pedestal, and instituted a [[Ebonics|strange English dialect]], apparently to deliberately hinder any opportunities that might come their way. Instead of competing for personal success through [[rape|responsibility]], organizations like the NAACP demand that the government fix their problems through social engineering such as job quotas and racial preferences. Many go so far as to demand outright monetary reparation for their forefathers' enslavement, which is their excuse for being lazy and getting money to buy more 40-ouncers and menthol light [[cigarettes]].

===[[Women]]===
[[Image:Wecantbake.jpg|left|75px|Then what use ARE you then?]]
[[woman|Women]], particularly [[feminism|feminists]], have their own complex as well. Women, to a lesser extent, have the same demands as blacks and the same persecutor in [[The Man]]. A few women claim to have internalized a further victim complex as a result of real personal tragedies such as [[rape]], childhood sexual abuse, or [[Shit nobody cares about|domestic violence]].  
''Some'' of them aren't lying. 

Many, many more women, especially [[lesbian|lesbians]] and more militant feminists, have taken on a delusional persecution complex not because they have been real victims of trauma, but because they [[almost raped|''could be'' raped]], ''could have been'' abused, and ''might be'' beaten - all by men, of course, because women never hurt each other, [[evar]]. Expressing their fear of these imaginary trauma is not a form of solidarity with their sistas, and definitely not condescending or insulting to real victims; it's a call for help. They need therapy. It is these militants with their complexes who are most likely to browbeat the men in their life into a [[liberal guilt]] complex even when those men have never raped, abused, or beaten anyone in their life. Because of this, some men now claim to be oppressed by these militant feminazis, and the circle continues.

===[[KKK]]===
[[Image:Virgin.jpg|left|75px|]]

After several thousand years of ''actually'' persecuting minorities, the [[KKK]] has gathered quite a few enemies. This allows even the establishment to play the victim card when a whining competition begins. This tactic was originally invented by the [[government|establishment]] but is now commonly applied by white people in general to counter the fierce whining of minorities. Any accusations of foul play or injustice can be dismissed as the other person having a victim complex. This neatly brings the guilt full circle, as The Man whines about his own victimization by the people he has victimized. Examples of so-called "victimization" of The Man include civil rights advances gained by minorities. If only Minorities could be like white people and pull themselves up by enslaving and exploiting fags for economic gainâ€¦

===[[Christians]]===
[[Image:75pxHitlerJesus.jpg|left|75px|]]

After nearly two thousand years of cultural and political dominion, Christians are now the victim of oppression. The forces of oppression against Christianity are [[atheist|atheism]], [[Islam]], [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], [[porn|erotica]], [[abortion|proponents of reproductive choice]] and [[evolution|proponents of scientific fact]]. According to Christians, any social or political theory or action that does not support Christian dogma is "oppressive" and intended to disenfranchise Christians of their social, legal and political standing. Nonetheless, Christians are still a dominant force in the West, with over 70% of all Americans claiming to be Christian, and many Christian [[fantard|zealots]] in political, financial and social positions of power. It remains a mystery how the [[Apartheid|majority can be oppressed]]; this is only further proof that anyone can play the Victim card.

===[[Atheists]]===

Of course, since Christianity has been basically emasculated by [[government|the establishment]] and liberal guilt, we should all have entered a golden age of humanism, free thought and enlightenment.  The reason we haven't is not because most people who aren't religious don't given enough of a crap to make a religion out of unreligion or jerk off to photos of fossilized dinosaurs while listening to Rush, it's because theists are oppressing the hidden atheist majority!  That's right, to the average nonbeliever, prayer in Parliament, 'in God we trust' written on currency, Christians stating their beliefs on 'hot button issues' or Muslims ruling through Islamic law in their own countries is mildly annoying and harmless, but to Real Atheists, it's yet another example of social oppression, just [[liek]] witch burning and crusades!  Their cause would be a lot more effective if they realized that playing the victim card and the smug card simultaneously is not the equivalent of a Royal Flush.

===[[Furries]]===

[[Image:Furryart.jpg|left|75px|]]
Furries: [[Some argue|Perhaps]] one of the most visible, irritating groups on the [[internet]] exhibiting the characteristics of the victim complex. Whenever a dissenting opinion is stated, or someone disagrees with their particular form of perversion, cries of [[fursecution]] can be heard across the tubes. Frequently they'll compare themselves to [[Jews]], since they're apparently being [[DO IT|rounded up and gassed]] in several camps in Germany at this very moment. [[Goons]] frequently take the initiative and fill their need for aggressors, even though no one takes it seriously aside from the furries themselves.

===[[Nice guys]]===

[[Image:Notagain-compy2.jpg|left|75px|]]

"Nice Guys" are bitter virgin nerds who believe that they are the only truly nice and caring guys in the world, and because of that, women should fuck them.  The idea that because you are nice to someone means you are entitled to sex is the very definition of [[batshit insane|lunacy]], but just try talking some sense into one of these morons.  They seriously have their heads so far up their asses that they think that anyone finding success with women is an "asshole" and that women are "only attracted to assholes."  They place ''all'' the blame for their failed attempts at a relationship solely on the female gender, backing it up with their E-bible known as the [[Ladder theory]].  I mean, they are NICE!! Which surely makes them blameless for their own actions.  The irony is most of these fags are bitter misanthropes who would rarely be considered nice by anyone.  They most likely have built up a delusion that they are automatically nice because they are nerds, and nerds are always nice in movies!  Victim complex on steroids.

===[[Wicca]]ns===
[[Image:Sabrina.jpg|left|75px|]]
Wiccans can claim victim status because their [[bullshit|ancient]] religious tradition was [[genocide|eradicated]] by the [[Christians]] [[at least 100]] years ago, although the Wiccan [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|"tradition"]] didn't exist before the middle of the 20th century. Furthermore, they believe that their religious beliefs are not respected by the mainstream population, and we all know that ridicule is the same as oppression. Examples of Wiccan oppression include the restriction of [[Harry Potter|The Wiccan Bible]] in public libraries, the failure of public schools to teach the principles of [[magick]] in science classes, and the inevitable [[flaming]] and [[troll]]ing of self-identified Wiccans on public forums.

===[[Scientology|$cientologists]]===

[[Image:Scientology - Tom.jpg|left|150px]]

'''Scientologists''' (AKA scifags, scilons, clams, etc.) are a group apart from all others.  If imaginary victimhood was a race, Scientology would be Ussein Bolt. Worse than any other religion, major or minor, they will cry "[[BAWWWW|religious persecution]]!" at the slightest perception of opposition to their dubious and clandestine cult-like practices and efforts to silence those who oppose them.  

The Church has consistently attempted to justify their highly litigious nature and reputation for [[lolsuits|abusing the legal system]] as being "[[lies|merely an attempt to defend our religious rights]]" - a veritable blank cheque for them to attack anyone and everyone who seeks to question their actions.  

The term "'''SP'''" (suppressive person) - an official term the [[Co$]] has used to label those who have criticized their practices or belief system for some time - is in and of itself perhaps the most ideal example of many Scientologist's deep-rooted victim complex.  Any who are seen as having [[Anonymous|valid criticisms of the Church's suspicious agenda]] or who oppose the Church's insatiable thirst for wealth and power are naturally so labelled. 

Of course, the more they fight critics with vexatious lawsuits, the worse their 'Church' appears, and the more attackers it finds.  More than ever, notable [[Tom Cruise|celebrities]] and [[David Miscavige|heads of the Co$ administration]] have attempted to champion themselves as untouchable martyrs in the public eye all the while attempting to control as many people as possible through their surreptitious machinations.

===[[You]]===
[[Image:Whomeyesyou1423.jpg|left|75px|]]
You're screwed sixteen ways from Sunday. Incorporation of a victim complex into your personality and attitude is probably your best bet, much in the way that a camper's best bet against a charging [[pedobear|bear]] is to roll into a ball and piss themselves. Society is not as well known for its compassion and mercy as your common North American Brown Bear, but its worth a try, and who are you kidding, are you really going to do anything to improve your situation that doesn't involve a hot jar of peanut butter and some hard-earned [[goatse]]? Face it: your friends don't really like [[you]]. Your house is just a convenient stop for peanut butter sandwiches on the way to Jimmy's house from school. Your teachers would rather give you an F than get you out of their hair because they have a unique tolerance reserved for only those who they want to screw over as much as you. And [[Raptor Jesus|God]] would love to throw you a bone to save you from continued assrape by the chance system he devised, but that would be cheating (and he doesn't really like [[you]] all that much). In conclusion, you are an asshole.

===Victim [[Drama]]===
It doesn't take an ethnic or gender identity to gain a group identity complex. Many [[disease|disease whores]] seek out and self-diagnose with popular illness in order to integrate with a larger group for the purpose of commiseration about how the "outside world" persecutes them and prevents them from succeeding.

The reality is that any personal challenge, failure, or even situation that can be internalized into a complex will be. If that complex can be turned back onto some other party to form [[liberal guilt]] all the better. Non-sequitur statements that identify such complexes abound, such as "I can't go to college because my husband is serving in Iraq."
