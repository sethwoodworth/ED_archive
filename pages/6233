[[IRL]] [[Guro]], without the [[fuck]]ing. The Pain Series [[pwn]]s [[Goatse]] on all levels.

It is a series of JPEGs, all ideal for [[troll]]ing unsuspecting [[LJ]] users, Though it should be noted that the pain series is a [http://lm.loldongs.eu/~weev/ last measure] as it will get you IP b& before you can say [[Battletoads]].

It was created by the user Huge_Midget on the SomethingAwful forums when it was decided that [[Goatse]] was too easy on the eyes.  Proper forum guerilla warfare required something special.  Thus the Pain series was born, although honorable precedents of this art form exists in the LP covers of the antediluvian goregrindy band Carcass, pioneers of lulz

Also of note one person didn't open the file but instead sent it to his brother, who is "hes a good little christian boy"  lulz will ensue upon my discovery of his reaction.
His brother's reaction.....
:"my brother is really pissed off and really disgusted. he wont finish his tomato soup for some reson."
This is his reaction....
:"now i know why he wont finish his soup, gross."
"I'll never eat again"
