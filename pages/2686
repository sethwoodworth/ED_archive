'''Epic Sword Guy''', aka Mario Majorski, was a [[batshit insane]] former Los Angeles [[scilon]]. On November 23rd, 2008, he decided to test his mighty [[Penis|hanzo steel]] dual-wielding prowess against the power of the gaijin's [[List of sex moves|ultimate technique]] in the parking lot of the [[Scientology]] Celebrity Center. He lost, and is now fighting the good fight against our galactic oppressors alongside [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_McPherson Lisa McPherson], [[Shawn Lonsdale]], and [[you]] if you think doing [[Chanology|stupid shit like this]] is still cool.

==So What Is Known?==

{{squote|An teenager who saw the man arrive in the parking lot said he stopped the car abruptly in the driveway and climbed out with a 5-foot sword in his hand and an angry expression on his face. Tony Marquez, 17, said the man, who was bald and had tattoos on his arms, walked toward the building, then returned to the car to get the other sword.|[[Brinks Home Security|The alarm didn't scare him off.]]}}

Majorski is on record as having completed at least three high-level Scientology courses in 1990. [[Kendrick Moxon]] helped him [[legal action|sue the state of California]] in 1993 because some [[hippie]] psychiatry professor at UCLA was talking smack about Scientology. The complaint said that the professor was "[[Waaaambulance|routinely practicing religious hatred]]."

{{squote|It is illegal and immoral for the University to provide tens of thousands of dollars of aid to West to try to destroy any [[religion]]. We intend to see that this is [[murder|stopped]].|Epic Sword Guy in June 1992, before he got his swords.}}

In his defense, the professor pointed out that he had once killed an elephant [[for the lulz]] by injecting it with [[over 9,000]] hits of LSD. Based on this evidence, the court decided that the professor was [[cool]] and dismissed the case.

Majorski also attended [[Saint Hill|I.A.S. Special Briefings]] (in [[Los Angeles]]) in 1992 and 2004. This is the last specific record of him, but the batshit insane [[Freezone]]r Pierre Ethier claims to have audited him. The last time they spoke to each other, he said that whales were monitoring earth and reporting back to their homeworld. It is safe to assume that he had dropped out and started watching ''[[Star Trek]]'' movies instead of ''Battlefield Earth''.

[[Some argue]] that Mario's [http://www.peoplefinders.com/summary.asp?fn=mario&mn=&ln=Majorski&dobmm=&dobdd=&doby=&city=&state=&vw=public+filings&Search=public+filings&utm_source=pipl&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=pipl_614 bankruptcy filings] had something to do with his attempt.

===So What Are They Telling The Scientologists?===

According those with relatives close to the source, the official line is that it was a random lunatic "With a long criminal history, recently released from prison" without mentioning that he was a long-time Scilon.

Shit, has anyone heard from [[ODB]] lately?

===So What Aren't They Telling Us?===

According to The Defamer (see link section), a Google search for "Mario Majorski" brings up a results page which informs the user that due to a legal request to Google, one search result has been omitted. The legal request was sent by the U.K.'s Internet Watch Foundation, and the substance of it is that the words "Mario Majorski" were returned by Google from a website which has been blacklisted as a supplier of child pornography.

If it's ED, we're hoping they'll tell us.

==A Cautionary Tale of Swords==
We at Encyclopedia Dramatica would like to enlighten our readers about the unseen perils of wielding such fiendish instruments of death. We've invited guest speaker Trip Fisk to demonstrate how to stay safe both at protests and at home.

{{squote|thank u for your kind words.

yes I sent it to the Int Justice thief.

and then I used my OT ability to get past their lame security in the the clo building (I swear I was completely invisible) and they are on a sharp look out for me as I created a "scene" last month, by putting dollars in the poor security officers' pockets, as they followed and pedaled about me.

The fire engine doesn't stop for the yapping dogs ON THE WAY TO THE FIRE.

I told them ALL that they were doing a great job! Well...it was a hot day and I thought they could use some pops. poor kids. one turned beet red with embarrassment as we were in front of the AOLA public. and I was in a very upstat car and wearing lots of jewelry, I really had the "celebrity" mock up going on and those poor saps have been trained to brown nose celebrities so I put them in a complete state on confusion.

art of war, sun tze. http://www.sonshi.com/learn.html

so as I made it to the clo's front desk, and staff obediently opened doors for me as I intended, I calmly laid this doc on the desk for the reception who looks 80 but might be 50, really could use a theta transfusion, and I wrote across the front in huge letters:
Body route to the international justice chief. He just sort of gapped at me and I calmly waltzed out got into a beautiful blonde's car and zipped away.

"one of us" I am just a simple thetan.
