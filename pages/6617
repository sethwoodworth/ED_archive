The only socially acceptable form of [[homosexuality]], next to [[football]].

No television experience is finer than [[gay|shirtless, oiled-up men]] with mullets and overtanned skin, dry humping each other in front of a crowd of [[Texas|inbreds.]] No television experience is more [[heterosexual]] than an aging blonde man sporting a Village People mustache and well-waxed saggy man-tits rip off his shirt in a broad show of masculinity, his barbaric yawp sending shivers through the crowd and a tingle through the bosoms of women and questioning youth everywhere.
What was once about showing wrestling skills has devolved into little more than a weekly soap opera, except with a far trashier audience. The shows are mostly taken up by the diva stars and the search for louder, more waxed, and more shirtless men to display their steaming masculinity and total lack of skill. Do not confuse professional wrestling with [[buttsechs]], though to the undiscerning eye it may appear nearly identical.

==World Wresting Entertainment (WWE)==
The <s>WWF</s> WWE is the oldest MMA promotion in the USA [[Shit nobody cares about|(Mehican group Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) having the edge on them by 40 years or so)]], having easily crushed it's opponents with money, ass and fail [[Lie|back in the days when wrestling was actually good]]. Back in the old days, (like [[last Thursday]]) they used to have storylines that were made for the non-retarded, good wrestlers and [[tits]]. Nowadays, they try their hardest to fuck everything up by doing crappy stories and making awful champions. (See [[John Cena]] and [[India|The Great Khali]])

===The Boss Nigger of the WWE===
Like any highly ritualized game of homosexual man-handling (a.k.a. being secure in your masculinity and not some immature fuck who makes gay jokes all day), wrestling is a tightly organized affair. Think the [[buttsechs]] you see on your TV is all that goes into it? [[lol]] [[n00b]]!!!  There's a whole crack team of [[Republicans|writers]] and gay artist types behind the scenes putting on the show.  And on top of it all is the boss nigger of all this dying company, Vincent [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] McMahon.

====Vince McMahon====
[[Image:VinceDeadMySpaceAd.gif|center|If only he were]]

Vince McMahon is the big ol' [[Badass|asshole]] behind the WWE, the main source of wrestling in the [[United States]] (except for TNA, but no one watches that because it's run by a Tennessee hick). He also owns it, therefore making him [[cunt|important]]. Also a frequent steroids user, Vince's main job is banning cool moves (the ones that actually look like they hurt people),and making himself appear as if he's more important than any wrestler, Championship, or RL event ever and getting other men to join his Kiss my [[Ass]] club ([[Srsly]]).

[[Last Thursday]], Vince pissed a lot of people off by pretending to have been blown up inside his limo, faking his death. This pissed off wrestling fans as they saw it as making fun of wrestlers who'd actually died, which it wasn't, but Internet fan > real fan (law of wrestling), so what can ya do. The [[FBI]] were also pissed because they had some [[faggot|actor]] pretend to be an agent and question people, but they're still pissed that they didn't win a steroid-abuse case against him. However, he pussied out of this storyline and completely abandoned it after [[Chris Benoit]] murdered a skank and her autistic son and became [[an hero]]. He felt terrible, so he thought it was necessary to make a 3-hour tribute to the asshole that killed his family. Way to go Vince, nice way to get up the ratings!

He bought his daughter fake [[tits]] though, so he did something right. And he also [[win|wanted to form an incest storyline between his daughter and his son]] (for real).

Now with ratings in decline, Vince hoped that 90 minutes of bullshit and only 30 minutes of wrasslin' will improve Raw, along with making the show appropriate for [[shit nobody cares about|teh kids]] by removing all of the [[swearing]], [[blood]], [[incest]] and [[shit]] that made it almost entertaining.

====Ric Flair====
[[Image:Ricflair.jpg|left|thumb|"Nature [[Pimp]]" Ric Flair wearing a cheap Persian carpet to hide his sagging, steroid-riddled man titties]]
[[Image:CodyRhodes.jpg|right|thumb|Rhodes son (the Gilette model, not the cross dresser) Legacy member Cody may avenge him some day with the power of [[triforce]]. Will produce next litter of children with [[Zelda]].]]
Wrestling as a whole is administered by its president (or "Nature Boy" in rasslers' [[retard|carny]] talk), Ric Flair. Ric Flair started working as a male [[whore]] and sideshow [[dickgirl]] impersonator over [[100 years ago]]. During the 1870's, he had a big [[drama]] with a [[fat]] [[black]] [[woman]] named Dusty Rhodes over who had the bigger [[man boobs]]. Surprisingly, both he and Dusty are still alive, making him one of the only wrestlers over the age of 16 not to become [[an hero]], and thus the head of it all by default. He also [[heart]]s [[Mike Huckabee|Huckabees]].

Ric Flair's signature move is slapping a dude's bare ass with the back of his hand. This repeated act of unadulterated [[faggotry]] has earned him the title "greatest ([[homo]]) of all time". [[Last Thursday]], Flair got tired of the manloving and decided to retire from the [[buttsecks|sport]], and now spends his time getting into fights (and getting the shit kicked out of him) with his [[bitch|daughter]] and her boyfriend. It should also be known that [[Wrestlecrap|RD Reynolds]] has a huge hard-on for Flair.

====The Miz====

Currently holding the WWE Championship because he traded his Money in the Bank briefcase(aka sucked off Mr. McMahon) for it, this asshole thrives on semen.  He can be seen backstage getting blown by and fucking Michael Cole hard in the ass before each match, which is how he becomes so [[Shit nobody cares about|awesome]].  This homo suffers from a severe case of unwarranted self-importance, and one second's worth of listening to his theme song is enough to recognize that sad fact.  Nevermind the fact that, as a heel, his character is wayyy too obvious and lacks even the basic sublety of EVERY  good heel in history.  Miz just comes off as a whiny, arrogant jock (but without the actual physical strength or ability).  

Michael Cole can be found consistently referring to him as a "technical wrestler", even though technical wrestlers are not nearly as shitty as Miz.  "I came to play"? More like, "I came to watch you get killed."

===Extreme Championship Wrestling===
ECW was once the internet geek's safe-haven, causing erections in the pants of [[fucktards|true wrestling fans]] for years back in the '90s, saying it was [[THE BEST|TEH BEST]] PROMOTION EVAR! Despite these claims, the company died because its owner, Paul Heyman, and his Jew buddies bankrupted it, resulting in several checks and payrolls bouncing like a superball and causing lulz in the process (that and publicly [[Jesus|crucifying]] employees [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNJpImxgQfg&NR=1 ]).

A lot of e-drama was sparked in 2006 when EC[[W]] was announced for the Sci-Fi channel. Without the traditional swearing, [[gore]], and sacrilege, all [[nerds]] could do was cry and accuse wrestlers of taking it up the pooper. Extremely Crappy Wrestling (often abbreviated ECW) <s>is</s> '''was''' the official home of wrestlers that nobody really gives a shit about.  But with all of that aside, some people actually eat this shit up.

===World Championship Wrestling===
A now defunct company which [[A challenger appears|tried competing with]] and actually beat the WWE in ratings for 84 weeks straight, but ultimately [[failed]] when people stopped giving a shit about it due to seeing the same oldfags like Hulk Hogan clogging it up. See [[Shit nobody cares about]].

After closing, the WWE [[epic_lulz|bought what was left of its rotting carcass and, even in death, continues to make WCW their bitch by selling all their shit while also owning all their former wrestlers' liknessess.]]

[[Image:Ll-tna.jpg|center]]

[[Image:800px-Tsim_and_mick_foley.JPG‎|thumb|TNA's [[TsimFuckis|biggest fan]].]]

TNA (Tits N Ass) is the show for the [[tsimfuckis|ignorant fucks]] who watch it cause they believe it's better than the WWE in every single way, despite how the company was started by a former WWE wrestler and employs what is mainly former WWE wrestlers and staff and of it's past 10 world champions, only two of them haven't been WWE wrestlers. In truth, TNA is the new WCW, swarming the WWE like vultures, waiting for the moment to swoop down and take stuff that WWE discards. Because of this most of TNA's talent are old fucks who injure themselves by walking.
[[Image:IMG 8647.jpg|thumb|TNA wrestler An Hero.]]


Infomercialist [[Billy Mays|Don West]], whom [[Opie and Anthony|O&A]] did impressions of back in the day (see [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|Shit nobody cares about]]), was an announcer for TNA for 7 years, but they got rid of him because he was <s>too good</s> awful and beyond repeptitive at his job getting people <s>excited</s> annoyed about shitty wrestlers, so they got a dirty washed up wrestler guinea named Tazz to replace him. "Be dialin', people! My only job is shilling shitty wresslin merch!"


Don West's and TNA's best moment, amiright?

<center><youtube>zIn0GchsGo8</youtube></center>

'''[[epic_failure|Ultimate diX]]'''

<s>The Ultimate X match is the only thing TNA has ever done right</s> TNA does nothing right, and this event is not spared. While WWE tries to figure out new ways to give the title to Edge and how to make John Cena likable, TNA just hangs a plastic X above the ring and watches [[at least 100]] guys kill themselves trying to get it. Of course, <s>being something entertaining and innovative that drew attention to the show, TNA decided that it was taking away TV time from the [[Old_media|wrestling legends]] and now you'll only see it once a year.</s> <---[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|Ha ha, disregard that, he sucks cocks]].

==[[Goatse|Ring]] of Honor==
''See [[Shit nobody cares about|THE HOME OF THE l337 WRESTLERZ  EBEN BETTAR THAN WWE wrestlers and TNA wrestlers  ]]''

==Ultimate Fighting Championship==
''See main article at [[MMA]]''.

Mostly kickboxing than wrestling, the UFC (Ultimate Faggotry Competition) is a "freestyle" promotion where bald, flabby metalheads kick each other in the shins before colliding in a frenzy of ear-biting and [[anal sex|ass-fucking]]...[[for great justice]].  Where the contenders in other rasslin' promotions are mostly [[white trash]], UFC fighters are [[goth]]s or [[skinhead]]s, and are always either [[America|'Merkun]], [[French]]-[[Canadian]], Belgian, [[Russia]]n or [[Tranny|Brazilian]].  UFC fighters and fans believe they are more [[Ripper|hardcore]] because they have black belts in [[over 9000]] martial arts, but real wrestlers could easily [[pwn]] them, as they're all old and fat.

Despite what Dana White and fans of UFC will tell you, any UFC fighter would get their ass raped in a real fight. Want proof? Look no further than the pussified rules for their fights:
*No eye gouging.
*No weapons.
*No closed fists.
*No open fists.
*Nothing that involves your feet leaving the ground.
*No one is allowed to make the champion look bad. (The John Cena/Triple H/The Undertaker/...fuck it, the list goes on Rule)
*The only legal move is the Mongolian Man Fuck.
*No hitting below the belt.
*No hitting above the belt.
*No movement what so ever, unless it involves stroking of the genitals.
*No items.
*Fox only.
*[[Super Smash Bros|Final Destination]].
[[Tourneyfag|It's obvious what audience UFC is trying to attract]].

==Wrestling Forums==

Perhaps some of the most easily (and amusingly) trolled boards on the internet dedicated themselves to the completely masculine art of wrestling. With the astonishing amounts of butt hurt generated by liking, disliking, or mentioning certain wrestlers, it makes for a fun and easy trolling.

The only board that is large and active enough to be trolled is an alleged wrestling site called "[http://www.caws.ws/ caws.ws]", and it is one of the lulziest board to troll. Famous for having all the female members [[Truth|being lesbians]] and being run by a pedophile and his rectal pal and completely run by unpaid moderators and staff, it has been suspected to be its owner(s) main source of income. 

[[Image: Johnstone.jpg‎|thumb|Typical [[Fag|CAWs.ws Forums User]]]].

One of the best (and easiest) drama generating techniques is to mention "JohnB", who was the [[lie|former]] co-owner of the site, and was forced into hiding after exposing himself to a thirteen year old member of the forums, who also happened to be a global moderator. ( [[pedo|John Brunton]] has been alleged as old as 25 at the time ) It is widely suspected that he is infact [[fact|still managing the site]].

The only thing closest to sex if you're a wrestling fan boy is [[fail|BOTCHAMANIA!]]

==Deathmatch Wrestling==
Invented by [[japanese]] [[sick fuck|sickos]] in the early '90s, this [[lulzy]] variant of professional wrestling is now performed by [[inbred]] [[redneck]]s, [[drug]] addicts and [[retarded]] [[teens]] all over the world. These guys [[rip and tear|tear each other apart]] with weedwhackers, [[self injury|cut their flesh]] with knives and scissors or throw guys off three story tall buildings to prove how [[gay|tough]] they are. Used weapons include barbed wire, lighttubes, thumbtacks, [[emo|razor blades]], knives, swords, explosives, panes of glass, live piranhas, [[your mom]], [[goatse]], [[Harlequin Ichthyosis Fetus|harlequin fetuses]] etc. CZW (Combat Zone Wrestling) and BJPW (Big Japan Pro Wrestling) are Hardcore wrestling promotions featuring lots of blood, gore and [[lie|lulz.]]

[[ugly|Pretty]] [[azn|asian girls]] are known for their brutal matches too.

==Popular wrestlers==
===[[Mordor|Triple H]]===
Ladies and [[Gentlemen|gentleman]], a prime example of a steroid user. [[lolwut|THE GAME]] TRIPLLLLLLLLLLLLLE...H!

[[Image:TripleH.jpg|center]]

Considered to be one of the [[fag|Biggest Superstars]] in the WWE today. Trips is considered as[[douchebag|a hero]] to many [[13 year old boys]] and [[16 year old girls]], but how you may ask? By taking [[steroids|ROIIIIIIIIDS!]]

The only reason hes so big in the WWE is because [[truth|he's sleeping with the bosses girl]] (after splitting with [[Chyna]]), and he literally is the bastard son of Vinnie Mac. [[lol|Big surprise kissing the bosses ass HHH!]]

Other than that, all he does in the ring is he kicks people in the [[balls|crotch]], [[69|Puts their head in between his legs]], and slams his face into the ground, and [[sex|humps the body for about 3 seconds]]. The bastard also cheats by "smacking" a sledgehammer on someones skull when Stephanie gets all pissy and gives HHH a bad storyline where he loses.

Also, did I mention that he's a steroid user?
<center>'''Good ol' DX [[amirite]]?'''</center>

===<s>Chris Jericho</s> Christina===
Yet another wrestler that Bam would not mind pole smoking for a few hours while Rodney G looks on and FAPs to. Once known for his long hair, band t-shirts and [[Lie|funny attitude]] back in the days of WCW became the [[serious business]], Armani-suit wearing, egotistical WWE wrestler from the [[butthurt]] he accumulated.

His initial achievements in the WWE including winning the Intercontinental from [[Chyna]] of Triple H's Degeneration X. Having the most title holds in the intercontinental title is one of Jericho's most frequently mentioned accomplishments. Then there was defeating the Rock and Stone Cold Steven Austin to become the undisputed unified heavyweight world title. At some point things sort of began to spiral and he cut his hair. Henceforth he became the one who claims to be [[Lies|the best at what he does]] only to be beaten later in the evening by an opponent who he claims can defeat without much difficulty. [[Image:Y2J.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Fritzl| >:/ ]]]]

Alongside his [[Unwarranted Self Importance|inflated ego]], he is apparently now known for his supposed [[Shit nobody cares about|immense intelligence and his extensive vocabulary]] used to continually describe the [[Verbose thread|physical composition and psychology of the audience in the arena]] week after week. He likes to shoot Gilette commercials with Cena and [[Triforce|Cody]] and will be in Men's Fitness just like McMahon and Cena. He was also in this [[Albino]] [[Farm]] movie.

<center>'''Jericho trying to troll on tv.'''
<youtube>tnR_WX5snAs</youtube></center>

Like many good citizens, the best way to deal with this is to A) call him 'Christina', as Shaquille O'Neal did, B) shout at the top of the voice 'YOU SUCK', C) let Mike Tyson give him a punch to the jaw or just yell out some derogatory response as he continually denies his weaknesses and flaws despite his many accomplishments. 

His signature moves are the Walls of [[Jesus|Jericho]] which is simply reverse ass-to-ass [[buttsecks]] and the [[crack|Codebreaker]] which is an instant one-shot [[blowjob]] knocking the opponent out cold with that satisfying hit <s>while they choke from his penis going into their stomachs.</s> LOLOLOL DISREGARD THAT he has not got that big of a cock.[[Image:Y2Jfags.jpg|thumb|Jerichos response to Rourke. Remember kids, rasslin' is totally NOT GAY.]]

As of mid to late 2009 he was the [[bitch|tag team partner]] and <s>currently</s> former Unified Tag Team Champion with [[Fat|Big Show]] (after Edge became an hero after dumping Show's Vicky), claiming to be the most [[lie|dominant tag team of this or any other era]]. <s>They cemented their [[Gay|relationship]] on [[goatse|Raw]] by having an awkward conversation about [[buttsecks|their usual topic.]]</s> OH NOES THEY BROKE UP!!! <s>As of now Big Show is cheating on Jericho with some [[MTV]] has-been named Teh <s>Miz</s> Jizz.</s> OH NOES THEY BROKE UP TOO!!!

To get revenge, Jericho hooked up with a British man in Florida named Wade Barrett. They are plotting their return to the top after Wade's former lover Jack Swagger stole his title after Edge hit the wounded Jericho with a SPEAR SPEAR SPEAR SPEAR SPEAR SPEAR SPEAR SPEAR SPEAR
