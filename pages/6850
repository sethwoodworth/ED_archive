'''Rave Match''' is a site where [[ravers]] seek out partners for anonymous [[sex|anal sex]].  The users of the site are [[pedophile|old men]] looking for [[16 year old girls]].  Sadly for the men, the "girls" are actually other [[80 year old Chinese man in panties|old men]].

==In AD 2006, war was beginning==
In Feburary of 2006, a war between the righteous armies of the New Rave Order, led by Supreme Commander Donut (with assistance from the [[GNAA]] and free agent Colonel Zarr), and the pedophiliac denizens of Rave Match has begun. In the opening salvo, NRO decimated the Rave Match defenders and stood in an excellent position to effectively repel any counterattack.

A cease fire was arranged through negotiation between Supreme Commander Donut and a Rave Match diplomat, The Lady LaLa, to deal with the threat of the notorious [[ass pirate]] Cristian Paduraru.  It is unknown at this time whether this will be a temporary alliance or a lasting peace.

==The Aftermath==
In the wake of the invasion and subsequent demoralization of the Rave Match community, Rave Match has suffered from scandals that have resulted in supposed police monitoring. Rumors have led to many viewing the RM website as a [[CP|child pornography]] environment and a playground for organizing sexual encounters between [[14/f/Cali|young girls]] and [[14/f/Cali|grown men]].

As of the time of this writing, Supreme Commander Donut has retired from New Rave Order over dissatisfaction with the Order's slack governance. Colonel Zarr has since been promoted at NRO to moderator and remains in charge of all future conflicts, though Ravematchers have long since given up trespassing on the NRO boards.

At Rave Match, the "sloth" presently remains a virgin.

==Dark Days==
Posted circa June 4th on the Rave Match.com website was the following message:

{{squote|As of June 18th, 2006, at 11:59PM central daylight time, RaveMatch will be closing. No refunds will be issued for unused VIP (per the terms of service agreement) unless it has been purchased within the past 6 months and you still have some remaining, and if that is the case, contact me for more info.

The website is up for sale should anybody care to continue this miserable legacy. However, nobody could pay me enough money to keep me involved here. If you're interested, please contact me via PM. Serious inquiries only. If I don't get any bites from the members by Thursday the 8th, the site will go up on the auction block on ebay for 10 days. If there's no buyer, it's gone for good.

Please do not e-mail me asking me "why" or "please don't" because e-mails of that sort will be completely ignored.

And I want to make it perfectly clear that I WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY WILD SPECULATION IN THIS OR ANY OTHER THREAD. If you know why, then you know, and if you don't, I'm sure you'll find out eventually knowing the way the rumor mill works around this god foresaken place, but KEEP IT OUT OF THE FORUMS, I'll ban whomever I have to in order to keep my private life private, but I'd ask that you use whatever little respect you have for me and leave it be.

It was a good run, and it was fun while it lasted, but like all things this too must end.

Thanks to those of you who have actually been good friends.|brb, fbi}}

==Ravematch Post-War System Fails==
Ravematch.com collapsed after that message, presumably after the arrest of its leadership on CP charges. Survivors have been forced into [[MySpace]], and have migrated to other messageboards.
