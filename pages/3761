HorseNews
{{perfect}}

'''HorseNews''' is an [[IRC]] news [[bot]] written in [[Python]] that updates the channel with news related to [[Horse|horses]]. Some argue that the malware bundled with [[KaZaA]] is more useful than HorseNews. Judging by the logs below it seems that HorseNews was probably created by a baby with Klinefelter's syndrome.  There are estimated to be 5 people, worldwide, that are interested in horse-related news and have the internet. 6 of those 5 people use Google News search instead of HorseNews.

The bot uses an [[RSS]] feed parser and an [[IRC]] client library. The [[RSS]] feed parser checks [[Google]] news every minute for new [[Horse|horse]] related stories. If any story that appears in the [[RSS]] feed is not present in HorseNews' cache, the link and title of the news story will be messaged to the channel(s) configured in the bot.

In addition to up-to-the-minute updates on breaking [[Horse|horse]] news, the bot also works on demand. If a user messages the channel with "!horse", HorseNews will post the last 10 [[Horse|horse]] news headlines to the channel. Each headline will be prefixed with a digit from 0 to 9. If a user wants to read more about a story, they can message the channel with !horse [digit] and then HorseNews will message the channel with the URL.

==Thank God for HorseNews==
