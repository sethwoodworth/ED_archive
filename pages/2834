Fair Game
[[Image:Connectone.jpg|thumb|Some games are just not fair.]]
Fair Game is kind of like [[The Game]] except that it sucks even more. It was created by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] as a means of "protecting" the [[cult|<s>Church</s>]] of [[Scientology]]. Anybody can be fair gamed for any reason, that includes: [[Anonymous]], [[Magoo|Ex-Scientologists]], [[OSA|Ex-OSAfags]], [[USENET]], [[RAGE|Brian Jennings]], [[South Park]], and [[You]]. [[Buy a Dog|Especially you]].


== Holy Shit, WHY? ==
{{quote|SP Order.  Fair game.  May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist.  May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.[http://www.fairgamed.org/fairgame.htm]|L. Ron Hubbard|HCO Policy Letter of 18 October 1967}}

Well, talk about [[butthurt]]. In other words, just about [[Fuck|ANYTHING]] a [[Scientologist]] does to [[Your Mom|ANYONE]] can be fair game.

=== "May be tricked" ===
If you even [[Idiot|joined Scientology]], you've been had. Don't even believe it when someone defends [[Scientology]] while stating that he/she is [[Will Smith|not a Scientologist]]. Anyone can be tricked into giving those [[Scientologists|Super-Jews]] money by setting up anti-psychiatry front groups such as [[Drugs|Narconon]], [[Psychiatry|Citizens Commission on Human Rights]], and a bunch of other [[bullshit]] [[circle-jerk|groups]] that are probably trying to molest your kids right now.

=== "Sued" ===
As if we needed to talk about this. [[Moralfags|Anyone]] that has even looked at this [[Crap|article]] is going to jail for [[Truth|slander]] or [[Jews did WTC|libel]] or some shit. Though it's strange that we could be sued for something that we have evidence for yet we cannot sue Scientology for making up bullshit like [[Marcab Confederacy|"Anonymous is being funded by Psychiatrists, gun runners, Nazis, and the Russian Mafia"]] with no evidence. Most [[Terryeo|scibloggers]] state that Scientology sues to keep its [[oxymoron|intellectual]] [[money|property]] from falling into the wrong hands. That sounds justified right? We wouldn't want that Tom Cruise Missile to get into the [[/b/|wrong hands]]. The <s>Church</s> of Scientology's numerous threats of legal action against those it deems [[You|Fair Game]] are a reliable source of lulz. But be forewarned: it's all fun and games until someone actually gets sued. Then it's hilarious!

=== "Lied to" ===
Everything that [[Tommy Davis]] says is a lie. Though most [[Dumbass|Scientologists]] would rather just play [[Ass|dumb]]. [[Xenu]]? [[Sperm|Thetans]]? I have no idea what you're talking about. Its pretty easy to see how every Scientologist [[lie|testimony]] you will ever hear [[Phoenix Wright|contradicts]] another story.

== Fair Game? In MY Chanology? ==
[[X? In My Y?|Its more likely than you think]]. In fact, it happens every fucking day. Idiots like [[Terryeo]] and [[Tom Newton]] constantly deny that Fair Game is still in effect because [[L. Ron Hubbard|a certain douchebag]] ordered the cancellation of fair game, but apparently only on the use of the term, not the act itself. [[lolwut|What the hell?]] Thats like saying "Alright folks, its called [[2girls1cup]] from now on, not Shitsluts, its bad publicity." Anyway, if you really are so [[otherkin|delusional]] that you think that Scientology is entirely innocent in this war then I ask [[ALL CAPS|WHAT ARE YOUR CRIMES]]?

== What can I do? ==
Nothing. It is impossible to reason with a Scientologist because 1) You are way too [[Lies|intelligent]] in comparison to them and 2) They honestly believe that [[Faggotry|Fair Game]] is a core tenet in their [[Bullshit|belief system]]. This has even been cited in court cases by Scientology's own lawyers [[Intellectual Checkmate|(not to mention, AFTER fair game was discontinued)]]. So don't even bother trying to explain yourself because you'll just be fair gamed again. In fact, [[statistics]] show that you are likely to be fair gamed at least twice between now and the time you go to the [[Masturbation|bathroom]]. [[David Miscavige|Big Brother]] is always watching you.

What you can do is not take candy or accept rides from Sea Org leaders. They will know you are a member of Anonymous, so they will make you and your anti-Sea Org friend the stars of an online video cautioning the public to not challenge Miscavige. And unlike in this one, the heroes won't get rescued.
