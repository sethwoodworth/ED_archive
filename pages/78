'''[http://www.315chan.org 315chan]''' was an alternative to [[711chan]] and [[Mudkipchan]], containing a mixture of [[Project Chanology|hopped up juvenile delinquents looking for kicks]], [[mudkip|people lieking a certain blue Pokemon]] and of course [[newfags]]. 315chan claimed to be a haven from [[Sparto|modfaggotry]] and promised to be fair on all matters of chan life (e.g. bans, who gets mod, etc). It was named after the [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY/IDES OF MARCH]] raids against Scientology.

== Formation ==

[[Image:315audience.jpg|thumb|300px]]

One of the main reasons 315chan was formed was to create a space where [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY|Chanology]] in all its beautiful forms and flavors could flourish, a place where [[Internet Hate Machine|raidfags]] and [[moralfags]] could coexist without the whole place descending into [[incest|infighting]] and other high school shit like that.

Modfaggotry and [[retards]] BAWWWING at 711chan was making it impossible to get anything done, as you never knew on opening the /xenu/ board when you would suddenly encounter fields of [[guro]] as far as the eye could see, or find the board itself deleted, or have idiots arguing about [[shit nobody cares about|stupid procedural details]] all day and night. 

711chan used to be kind of [[lie|a win place]] but its general [[pussy|attitude]] to Chanology has always been somewhat [[bisexual|ambivalent and shifting]]. In contrast, 315chan had the Eye of the [[Tiger]] and was fully confirmed for brawl. 315chan nevar gave up until enturbulation took up the flag, ensuring that the the pallid corpse of "Church" of Scientology Inc. will rot in a cold, dank, hellish, non-tax-exempt blue asbestos cesspool of confusing and unfamiliar and impenetrable bureaucracies, and David Miscavige and Tom Cruise will have both bought curtains, a phone recorder, and a dog.

315chan's [[niggers|staff]] were all fairly active (all [[300]] of them) and could often be found on [[IRC]], which could be found on the [[partyvan]] IRC network (irc.partyvan.us) in #315chan.

== Closure ==

As of 7/7/08 315chan closed down, citing [[hate | his distaste with the state of Chanology as a raid]]. [[711chan | Promising /kipz/ will be rehosted]], denvetta explained that 315chan had finished with its purpose of keeping Chanology alive on the chans, acknowledging silently that the it was now the property of those moralfags at [[Enturbulation]].

== Drama ==

* '''First Wave'''

Some [[newfag|BAWWWWfagging skiddies]] with a botnet DDoSd the 315chan server, causing it to go down.  Later it was back up.

* '''Second Wave'''

The Partyvan wiki was down, and as 315chan is on the same server, it was also down. Later they were both back up.
