Six Apart
[[File:Voxclosed.png|thumb|[[Vox.com|A typical Six Apart project]].]]

The company that bought [[LiveJournal]], and the accounts of squealing [[13 year old girl|13 year old girls]], their 17 year old [[Pedobear|boyfriends]] and the [[Paraphilia|sexual deviants]] that prey on both.

Six Apart was co-founded by [[Mena]], who now serves as its President. Some dude named Ben is the other co-founder.  They [[fuck]].

In September 2007, Six Apart fired its CEO [[Borat|Barak]] Berkowitz due to pressure from Neo-[[nazi]] groups on LiveJournal and replaced him with some guy with a much less Jewy name.

== Business strategy ==
Six Apart's business strategy for LiveJournal is simple: [[Furries|sexual deviants]] are willing to pay. Attracting more sexual deviants (by, for example, opening LiveJournal to preteens) will increase the [[Jew Gold|profitability]] of LiveJournal. (See [[Paid account]])

Since Six Apart has already convinced people to pay for Typepad and [[Moveable Type]], they have enough money to continue [[baiting]] deviants.
