Paula Deen
{{天|<big><b>Warning:</b></big> Due to Paula's shitty cooking habits, this article contains large amounts of [[cum|butter]] and will give you [[diabeetus]].|Tonsofbutta.jpg|140px|#FFFF00}}

'''Paula Deen''' is what most [[Europe]]an faggots consider Americans to look like. An [[old|elderly]] "[[Hick|down-home Southern]]" [[BBW]], Paula Deen is [[Fatass|obese]], loud, horny, abusive and obnoxious. Her [[white trash|white-trash]] southern drawl will give you nightmares.

== "Chef" Deen ==

[[Image:Paula Deen Da Whoop.jpg|left|MUCH BETTER]]

Paula's cooking is [[Lie|world-known]] for its [[Unrealistic expectations|health and nutrition qualities]], as well as its [[Vegan|strong vegan support]]. To date, Paula Deen has not produced a single recipe without her secret weapon, which is [[semen|butter]]. Paula Deen loves the taste of butter, the smell of it, and the texture of it. She has been known to [[Blowjob|eat butter off the stick]] or [http://www.slashfood.com/2006/03/09/paula-deen-drinks-butter/ drink it] on recorded television. Everything, from steamed vegetables to porterhouse steak, gets a liberal coating in butter. Even her desserts are loaded with butter (and plenty of sugar, to top it off).

Occasionally, she will bring her two fatass sons onto her show. As she "cooks" her horrible [[I see what you did there|con''cock''tions]], she and her [[failure]] [[redneck]] children talk about how crappy their childhoods were. Once the food is done cooking, she always has to take the first bite of the shit.

The majority of Deen's recipes are certified Atkins approved, though a small number of them contain a disgusting and unhealthy ingredient, like berries or [[Peanut Butter Jelly Time|bananas]] or various other poisonous plant matter. However, in those rare cases, most of the hazardous content of the fruit (like vitamins and nutrients, for example), are effectively destroyed through the deep frying process she employs with all her recipes. Despite this, if you are a health nut on Atkins, you can always substitute more butter for the fruit and it will be rendered Atkins safe, so you can continue to maintain a [[Bullshit|relatively normal]] (by American standards) waistline while avoiding catastrophic internal decay and rot, which is never associated with diets containing high levels of meats and animal fats and virtually no plant nutrition (source: Corporate Nutritional Sciences of [[Stupid|America]]). 

Paula Deen has been awarded several honors from the livestock and dairy industries of America, and she has also received many esteemed awards from the Fad Diet Book Marketing Cooperative (FDBMC) for her contributions to the general stupidity (intellectual castration due to excess fats and grease), laziness, and gluttony of the American public.

== The Buttergasm ==

A mini-meme of /ck/, the "[[orgasm|buttergasm]]" can be seen in many of Paula's cooking show segments. Her eyes will glaze over and a large grin will appear on her face when mass quantities of butter are within sight. Thus, many compared this with a female orgasm, and the buttergasm was born. Then again, typical [[redneck|people of the south]] have no restraint about what things they fornicate with, be it their cousin, a toaster oven or a bit of solid cholesterol pressed into a yellow rectangular form.

{{squote|I was wrong. This is vile. I can't believe the food network has this recipe available on their website and even more so, I can't believe Paula Dean considered this something to make on a show. This is a horrible recipe.|The damage has already been done.}}
HAHA DISREGARD THAT it's not her idea, this is very similar to a traditional german food called sauerbraten, which are little balls of pork and pork fat that are either fried or baked. dumbass.

{{squote|I would give an appendage to see her cholesterol count. This woman has ingested so much milk fat in her life that even cow's look at her and say "DAMN!". Paula, please, please, please eat a salad for once. I wonder if this woman would melt or sizzle if she laid out on the beach. What other cook would even consider publishing this recipe? This recipe is just wrong on so many levels.|DAMN!}}
