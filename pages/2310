Docs
:''[[Not to be confused with]] [[The Google|Google Docs]].'' {{clear}}
[[File:Doxfridgewatlol.jpg|thumb|200px|This is the general idea.]]

'''Docs''' are information an Internet personality would like kept secret, such as their real name, current address, SSN, and phone number. These are things they would [[Buy a dog|install a security and phone tracing system]], use [[passwords]], and [[firewall|build a moat]] to protect. Docs may also include information on close relatives. Many people do things on the Internet which they would rather not leak into their [[IRL]] circle of acquaintances (such as their [[User:Creativity|sexual practices and fantasies]]) so dropping dox can be very destructive to [[victim]]s' personal lives. 
After notorious [[skript kiddie|hacker]]/[[phreak]] scenester Bobink widely distributed his impeccably complete flat-file docs database named [[Notepad|pokemon.txt]], it became a long-standing [[Basement Dweller|scene]] tradition to call your collection of docs [[Pokémon]] (Gotta catch 'em all!) and the file that they are collected in a Pokéball.

==My Documents==
[[Image:CircaRigelEfnet.png|thumb|right|[[Internet detective]] [[circarigel]] gets doc'd. Posted accounts of bipolar symptoms, suicide attempts and  alt.sex.abuse.recovery.]]
[[Image:New-top-secret.jpg|thumb|right|Always search for their folders labelled "Top Secret."]]
Reports are usually made up of both [[Tumblr|published information]] and information the target intends to keep [[Sexting|confidential]]. Typically, dox of the latter type are where moar [[lulz]] can be found.<br>
'''Dox usually contain:'''
* Full Name
** E-mail Address(es)
** Internet Usernames/Handles/Alias
** Maiden and [[Wife|Married]] Last Names
** [[IRL]] Nicknames
** [[Hacking|Passwords]]
* [[The Sims|Address of Residence(s)]]
** Current or Past, Rented or Owned
** City, State of [[lolicon|Birth]], where raised
* Professional Background
** [[Walmart|Address of Workplace(s)]]
** Companies Worked For, Businesses Owned
** [[China|Military]] Service
* Phone Number(s)
** Landline and Cell
* [[Internet Tough Guy|Criminal]] Record
* Info on Friends/Family
** Known Relatives
** Associates, Friends, and Coworkers
* IP Address/[[Comcast disease|ISP]]/Domain
* Organizations Involved With
** [[Nerd|Universities]] Attended
** [[Emo|High School(s)]] Attended
** Associated [[Party Van|Parties]], [[Libertarian|Political]] Affiliation,
** Civic Notability
** [[Poor|Financial History]]
* Miscellaneous Info
** [[Masturbation|Personal Hobbies]], [[Dyke|Sexual Orientation]], [[Asperger's syndrome|Medical History]], etc.<br>

Foreign addresses can be a bit hard to decipher. If you have something like a Danish address (Address:Ekholmsnäsvägen 114 - 181 64 LIDINGÖ) put some kind of note into the bottom, or better yet, split it up into Zip code, street address, house number, etc. This is to be done for BOTH Americans and Europeans. ([[BAWW|If you have some kind of qualm about the fattest country in the world, the one with the most niggers, Jews, cats, etc. This is NOT the time for it, asshole]])

== Filling your Filing Cabinet ==
[[Image:Engineer Dox.png|thumb|right|[[Engineer]] obtains Dox.]]
Obtaining dox is a [[Google|subtle art]] known only by [[Basement dweller|intelligent internet users]]. Generally if you have an [[IRL]] name or screen name of the target, first [[Yahoo!|Google]] their name. It's pretty surprising how retarded people are on the [[Gaia Online|Internet]]. For anyone with any appreciable internet presence, it often isn't hard to find their personal lives splayed across [[MySpace]], internet [[NeoPets|forums]], [[Amazon]], etc. [[Everybody|Dumb shits]] generally use the same screen name on all of the services they're signed up for, so this part is pretty easy. Once you have some information, you can lurk through voter registration records, criminal records, and so forth, getting names of relatives somewhere along the way. Also, don't forget to search the [[Racist|White]] Pages, since if they are listed, your job is a lot easier. 

If looking up a screen name yields nothing, try to get an IP address. Anonymous users on wikis will have their IP addresses displayed, and usually you can extract an IP address from an email header. A simple [[WHOIS]] search will give the ISP and general location of the user.

===BUT WAIT===
If retrieving docs is going to require you to spend a long time "[[whiteknight|getting to know]]" some [[fag]], then [[Abortion|abandon fucking ship]], as some groups of [[Scientology|people]], will take their friends to [[circle jerk|furry rituals]] where they will forever convert you to a [[furfag]]. Although, to a [[basement dweller|shut-in]], an e-friend's (their only friend's) betrayal can be very crushing, making the end result very [[lulzy]], long-term effects on you are permanent. In other words, ''You're a fucking furry!''

Please note that there is a difference between being converted and obtaining [[knowledge]]. For example, breaking into somebody's [[hacker|email]] may require answering personal security questions. With enough research and time spent [[Internet stalking|observing/befriending]] a target, these questions are usually easy to fool.

*'''[http://www.whitepages.com/find_neighbors Whitepages Neighbour Finder]''' - Need to confirm dox? A clever researcher can confirm addresses by calling neighbors and asking for the target.

*'''[http://www.geoiptool.com/ Geo IP Tool]''' - Some IP addresses can be used to narrow down where a person is located.

* '''[http://www.ip2location.com/ ip2location]''' - More accurate!
*'''[http://www.paterva.com/maltego/community-edition Maltego]''' - Maltego is an information intelligence tool and a data mining tool. It provides excellent results when e-mail addresses and full names are used.
[[Image:TVTropesDox2.gif|right|thumb|200px|The TV Tropes method]]
*'''[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/el.php?findfor=InsertNameHere TV Tropes]''' - If you have a username and think they may use this site, you can get their [[IP address]].

'''Images'''
*'''[http://tineye.com/ Reverse Image Search]''' - You can use this handy tool to see what sites have pictures of the target.
*'''[http://photobucket.com/ Photobucket]''' - Right click photos the target has embedded, and see if they come from Photobucket. The URL will contain their username, which you can search for under "People" on Photobucket's website. Usually profiles are private, but every now and then you get a [[Camwhore|fucktard]] who leaves it public and uploads [[tits|nudes]]. Note that the backgrounds of images are equally important as their subjects, as these can give various leads about a target's whereabouts. Utilizing the target's Photobucket account may lead you straight to their front door, regular hangouts, or bathroom mirror.
*'''[http://regex.info/exif.cgi EXIF Data]''' - Most digital cameras use a format called EXIF, which may contain a geotag that you can use to locate the place of the photo. '''Note:''' Facebook and MySpace mongle EXIF data when images are uploaded. Photobucket however, leaves EXIF data intact.  
'''Government Databases'''
*'''[http://www.192.com/ 192]''' - Looking for UK docs is a pain in the ass. 192.com helps you get around that by accessing voter registration.
*'''[https://www.courts.mo.gov/casenet/base/welcome.do Missouri Courts System Case]''' - [[Rednecks|Missouri]], a capital of trolling innovation, once again leads the way with trolling resources.  Database of all court files (civil, criminal, probate, family) for citizens or those charged in the state of Missouri, over the age of 18.  Look for your state's equivalent.
*'''[http://www.criminalsearches.com/ Criminal Record Searches]''' - Even minor traffic offenses can be found, and if they've been arrested you can usually find a mugshot at the respective police department's website.  However, this website failed to find the criminal record of a convicted cop killer in Ohio.  He came up clean.
*'''[http://www.blackbookonline.info/ Blackbook Online]''' - Free Public Records Search Engine. Links to many government sites for everything from background checks to parcel value.
*'''[http://www.dmv.org/ DMV]''' - A [[Bill Gates|privately owned]] webpage that links to state DMV's.
*'''[http://skipease.com/ Skipease]''' - People search and Public Records. Everything from SSN searches to Death Indexes.
*'''[http://www.whoishe.com Who is He/She?]'''- Background checks and shit. Probably have to Jew, IDK.
'''Maps'''
*'''[http://www.maps.google.com Google Maps]''' - Use Google maps / Streetview to dig up pictures of the target's residence. Large amounts of the USA / Europe / Australia are now covered by Google Streetview making it easier for you to direct prostitutes to the target's address. Often times you can find pictures of a target's vehicles, and every now and then you can discern the license plate number.
*'''[http://www.google.com/earth/index.html Google Earth]''' - Incase the target may be located on Mars.
*'''[http://www.mapquest.com/ MapQuest]''' - Google Maps but not.
'''Miscellaneous Tools'''
*'''[http://krilome.com/aprod/index-cse.html Calulator Safe]''' - You know how you hide your [[Jenkem|drugs]] in that fake soda can? This calculator is kind of like that, except you can secretly hide a file in it. You can only hide one file at a time, but hiding a compressed file works around that. It is a [[Spyware|freeware]] [[Windows|.exe]], so you can keep it on a flash drive, and no installation is required. Please note that, just like how the cops immediately knew the [[obvious|soda can in your sock drawer]] contained your stash, a 40 GB calculator will arouse suspicion. It is more of a security through obscurity kind of tool, which means you will still be [[Party van|v&]] but is still [[Gay|fun]]. Don't hide large files.
[[Image:Kraken-imagen3.jpg|thumb|right|All your Dox coming to sink your e-boat.]]

== Release the [[Fat Girl Angle Shot|Kraken]] ==
After obtaining Dox, the next step is obtaining [[Lulz]]:
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites Craigslist]''' - Make an ad in the "Free Stuff", "Erotic Services," or "Casual Encounters" section. There are many [[Jimbo Wales|horny men]] who will relentlessly pursue someone who they believe to be [[14/f/Cali|19/f]], as is evident [http://anonym.to/http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/RFJason_Craigslist_Experiment here].
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://www.inspot.org STD Postcards]''' - Send an e-postcard notifying the target that one of their previous sexual partners had a [[Genital Herpes|STD]]. Makes for an uncomfortable wait for them. Alternatively, call an [[AIDS]] hotline and ask them to anonymously tell the target they could have HIV. That's a 6 month wait until the test comes back.
*'''[https://www.ups.com/labels?loc=en_US&WT.svl=SubNav Free UPS Boxes]''' - Create an account and order the target a couple of hundred boxes and labels. FedEx also offers free boxes.
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://maps.google.com/ Google Maps]''' use Google Maps to locate businesses that will be able to visit the target at all hours. Be sure to have the target's dox at hand and to know nearby cross streets, in order to give directions. When making an order, make it plausible (e.g. 2 pizzas), so that no suspicions are aroused. Occasionally businesses ask for a telephone number and unless you have a Skype number, it's best just to give the target's. Use searches such as:-
::''"Pizza (insert zip code)"''
::''"Locksmith London,UK"''
::''"Emergency Plumber Toronto,Canada"''
*'''[http://www.wikihow.com/Forge-Email You are now >>Insert Name Here<<]''' - Does the target partake in questionable activities? Now you can email them, as the [[V&|FBI]], Interpol, or whatever. They'll [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|be scared shitless]] if they think they're gonna be vanned. This site'll point you in the right direction.
* Send [[Dox#External Links|condoms]] and [[masturbation|lube]] in the target's name. See below for links.
===[[Prank Calls]]===
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://www.skype.com Skype]''' - Call the target. When you first register a Skype account you get one free call, however call rates are fairly cheap. You can purchase Skype credit in stores such as Walmart or purchase unlimited calls to numbers in N.America for just $3/month. It is possible to call many businesses for free, without requiring any credits, with [[Google|GOOG411]]. Simply dial +1.800.4664.411 in Skype and say the city, state, and business name/type.
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://www.ip-relay.com/ IP Relay]''' - Ask the operator not to announce at the start of the call. This is a service only available to people in the USA.
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://icall.com/free-phone-calls/ iCall]''' - Make a free 3 min call in your browser at iCall. You can also download a client to make slightly longer calls for free.
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://labs.jaduka.com/earthcaller EarthCaller]''' - Use Earth Caller to make free calls to anywhere in N.America, note that you have to use Internet Explorer to use it, install the [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1419 IE Tab] addon if you wish to use Firefox. Unlike other VOIP services it does give a proper telephone number on caller IDs.
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://labs.jaduka.com/dukaDial DukaDial]''' - Use DukaDial to call two numbers at once. Try your target an the White House Situation Room( '''202-456-9431''' ), the local FBI/Police department, or maybe just a random Craiglist hooker.
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://www.prankdial.com PrankDial]''' - You get a couple free calls a day. However, I'm sure there's a way you can aquire more free calls without shedding [[jewgold]].
*'''[http://anonym.to/http://labs.jaduka.com/dukaUS DukaUS]''' - Can be used to make free conference calls with up to 6 participants. It gives you the option to individually mute participants. Dial two numbers as well as a partyline, so that you can listen in on the chaos.
*'''[http://www.voipbuster.com/en/index.html VoipBuster]''' - You get like 30 minutes free with each program so when you run out of mins just make a new account. If you get error 32 while registering at those VoIP programs just make new Windows User, logout, [[No U|change IP]], login to new User, reinstall and keep calling.  If it happens again, you need to delete [[System 32]] to clean your history. Try these:
<blockquote>[[TL;DR|VoipCheap UK, VoipCheap, VoipDiscount, Voiphit, VoipRaider, VoipStunt, VoipWise, VoipZoom, WebCallDirect, NetAppel.fr, Nonoh, Poivy, SIPDiscount, SMSdiscount, SmsListo, SparVoip, Text4Calls, VoipBuster, 12Voip, BudgetSIP, Calleasy, DialNow,  FreeCall, InternetCalls, Intervoip, JustVoip, LowRateVoip, ActionVoip, Jumblo]].</blockquote>
