'''''Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney''''' is an [[Power Rangers|adaptation]] of a [[Japanese|Japan only]] Gay Boy Advance game for the [[Nintendo DS]], released by [[Capcom|Crapcom]]. The player assumes the role of...

What, another port? 

Anyway, the player assumes the role of a defense attorney in the court of law in the year 20XX, in a city named [[Japan|Los Angeles]] where [[Holocaust|everyone's being killed]]. The legal system has undergone such a [[clusterfuck]] as to allow prosecutors to literally get away with murder, and shorten trials to a maximum of 3 days. [[bullshit|Joy]]. And they made five of these fucking games.

Although this game is extremely [[gay]], beware of its incredibly retarded fanbase. Every Phoenix Wright fanboy thinks that he is the only one who understands the deep logic behind the game, and enjoys looking up PW music on YouTube to post their stupid dialogues.

==[[The Game]]==
[[Image:MyObjections.jpg|thumb|right|Does something strike you as odd about that last bit of testimony, Your Honor?]]
To call ''Perry Mason: Ace Attorney'' a game would be akin to calling [[Snapesnogger]]'s nagas 'art'. Basically, it's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game not unlike the old Ken Livingstone books, with each day of each trial split into two bits - Procrastination and Masturbation. The objective is to establish your client's innocence in [[Internet_court|court]] and spare them the death penalty, while catching the [[O.J. Simpson|real killer]] of each case.

During Procrastination phases, the player gets to flick between five backgrounds and talk to hundreds of characters, getting absolutely nowhere in the process. You're required to throw every piece of evidence you have at everyone, but picking the wrong option always has the same result. 99.999999% of the time, you will be reading text that scrolls across the screen without actually interacting with anything except semi-animated full-view portraits.

In this phase, much of the [[fail|humor]] takes place. Most of it involves watching the characters act like complete [[retards]] and make inane comments about the most idiotic things. What makes it even worse is the games tendency to reuse the same three animations(Happy, Shocked, and Won't-Shut-the-Fuck-Up) over and over, forcing characters to narrate (as if there wasn't enough reading) what they're doing.

Once the Masturbation stage begins, the player will have to <s>copiously ejaculate over the female sidekick</s> go through [[over 9000|several more]] pages of text. During cross-examination, the player then has to present [[evidence]] to refute a witness' statement. Oftentimes the evidence needed will be completely random, because the game often leaves you with [[I'm_so_confused|no fucking clue]] about what to do next. This will all be done while everyone points and screams at each other like [[retarded]] children to the soundtrack of [[j-pop|MegaMan music]]. Most cases are won by presenting [[Fifty Hitler post|Hitler 50 times]]. 

{{quote|<small>Phoenix: OBJECTION!
Judge: What is it, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix: Oh, nothing. I just wanted to hear﻿ the song.</small>| Some guy who got 102 thumbs up}}

Since this is a port for the Nintendo DS, some [[rape|touch]] controls were bolted onto the game, as well as a [[fanfiction|new case]] and a [[shit]] voice command option. Since the voice command doesn't work properly without screaming into the mic, no one uses it.

Further features include:
* A new case bolted onto the first game that caused a [[time paradox]] before the Apollo Justice game arrived
* Eye-breaking 3D GRAFIX for the fourth game (the kind that went out of fashion on the SNES)
* Bugger all else

==[[shit no one cares about|Characters]]==
[[Image:Gay vibe over nine thousand.png|thumb|Perry Mason makes a startling discovery about his rival, Hamilton Burger.]]
Just like all games worshipped by the [[wapanese]], ''Phoenix Wright'' has a cast of characters that have become Internet celebrities. These characters include:

===PW1: Phoenix Wright===

====Phoenix Wright (obviously)====
Phoenix is a spiky-haired ex-[[raver]] who wandered into law school one day while he was high and decided to stick around. Then he murdered Mia Fey's boyfriend, or something like that.  Needs [[CP|kids]] and [[necrophilia|dead people]] to help him solve the most obvious of cases.  He is not a real attorney, as he doesn't even know how to check his own fucking pockets for evidence prior to the start of the game.  He is known for obnoxiously shouting "OBJECTION!" while childishly pointing at the prosecution before being embarrassingly [[STFU|shut down]] by every character in the courtroom. He's also gay for Miles ([[stalker|waiting 15 years just to see him again]]). Has a <strike>ladder</strike> stepladder fetish. In the 4th (or 5th, [[shit_no_one_cares_about|it doesn't matter at this point]]) game, he becomes a [[hobo]] with a snow hat that truly reveals his hidden bisexuality.

====Mia Fey====
Phoenix's dominatrix sex master. She tells him <b>exactly</b> what to do and literally [[bitch|commands his every action early in the game]]. When she dies, Phoenix is completely lost and has no idea what the fuck he is supposed to do in a courtroom. Her reappearance as main character in 3-1 and 3-4 give gamers a [[fanservice|healthy]] dose of [[anime|animu]] [[tits_or_GTFO|cleavage]]. Good work, Capcom! Also Diego Armando's "[[furry|kitten]]" and sex-slave.

====Maya Fey====
Mia Fey's [[jailbait|younger]] sister, [[otherkin|the human reincarnation of the "I can haz cheezburger?" cat]], and Phoenix's [[secks|partner]]. Maya loves wearing sandals and eating [[cock|burgers]]. Since she is a [[whore|spirit medium]], her older sister contacts her from beyond the grave and informs her of Phoenix's utter incompetence, then tells her to go tell him [[become_an_hero|what to do]] until he stops being a pussy and can make his own decisions again. Not that anyone cares, because her breasts grow like three thousand sizes in the process. Like the fucking Grinch. It's harder than it sounds - Maya channels Mia in almost every case afterwords. She also has a bulging erection for the Steel Samurai and his Zero-Wing motto "[[All Your Base Are Belong To Us|For great justice]]".

====Miles Edgeworth====
The prosecuting attorney that you deal with in EVERY SINGLE CASE (in the first game of course, because of Capcom's [[fetish]] with replacing characters with other random, useless [[fucktards]]). Was going to become a defense attorney until his mentor shot his dad for [[STFU|speaking out of turn]]. Edgeworth is obviously a pimp and everyone else in the game is his bitch, particularly Gumshoe. His new game, ''Miles Edgeworth: Pimp-ass Prosecutor'', is slated to sell over 1 billion copies due to both men and women buying it so they can masturbate while playing.  He is the only man on Earth who can still get away with wearing <strike>an ascot</strike> A CRAVAT, GET YOUR GAY ON. HAHAHAHAHA. [[lol wat|He could have sex with his sister and not have it be incest, since technically he was an orphan, even if she was really his sister it wouldn't be incest because Miles is that kind of bad ass]]. Phoenix also [[buttsecks|burdens]] him with [[gay|unnecessary feelings]], and he [[obsessed|flies halfway around the world]] when [[Larry]] tells him Wright tried to become [[an hero]] by setting a bridge on fire and diving into a frozen river.

====Detective Dick Gumshoe <strike>LOL YOU SAID DICK</strike>====
[[fail|Failure]] of a detective who, like many characters in the series, [[retard|doesn't even know how to spell his own job]].  Gumshoe <b>always</b> leaks secret evidence and has <b>never</b> gotten his facts straight on the stand in his entire life. He has a trusting [[gay|relationship]] with Edgeworth and [[buttsecks|teams up]] with Edgy for the spin-off, which includes shit fullbody ports instead of the normal severed upper body. Quote Gumshoe: [[gay|"Mmmmmmmm..."]] He finally gets his ass fired in JFA but everyone was afraid he'd burn down the nearest building unless someone was around to babysit him, so he was re-hired.

====Manfred von Karma====
Edgeworth's morbidly-obese and generally morbid [[Nazi|German]] sex master. He killed Edgeworth's dad, then raised him to be a homosexual douchebag prosecutor. Never lost a case in his 40 year career, until Phoenix Wright shows up and [[COMBO BREAKER|not only beats him in the court of law]], but proves that he is guilty of murder through [[insane|batshit]] theatrics. Has a bullet in his shoulder because Edgeworth shot him... [[cum|if you know what I mean.]]

====Larry [[ass|Butz]]====
A good-for-nothing lazy ass wannabe-[[an hero]] who just so happens to be Phoenix's childhood friend. He [[rape|somehow]] manages to get lucky with models often and unlike all the other male characters has [[lie|'no interest in dudes']]. The main purposes of his character include [[epic_fail_guy|failing at every job he ever gets]], getting cheated on by all his girlfriends, being about as useless in court as Gumshoe, and [[rape|hitting on]] Maya. Becomes a [[child_pornography|CP]] artist at the end of PW3.
Larry Butz comes in three [[cum|exciting flavors!]] Normal retard in the jacket, Plus-sized retard with a cop uniform, and NEGA GAYFAG RETARD in the pink schmock. With a monkey on it. And a Beret. But he has no interest in dudes, sooo...

====[[fucktard|Winston Payne]]====
The only non gender-curious man in the series. Though he is 52, he exhibits all of the behaviors of a [[13-year-old boy]], such as annoying the hell out of you with his high-pitched voice and [[unwarranted self importance]], and being generally [[loser|incompetent]]. Comes back for every single fucking game as the first prosecutor you [[falcon_punch|face]]. Mia once pwned him in court so badly [[Wut|all his hair flew away]].

====[[IT'S A TRAP!|April May]]====
One horny chick who apparently is in fact worth mentioning because of the ridiculously large boobs she has, resulting in extreme cleavage that every man will fap to; no no, [[srsly]], [http://aceattorney.wikia.com/wiki/File:April_May.png | look at the size of those fucking jugs]. These boobs seem to defy normal physics, often bouncing up and down for minutes on end. A witness to the case where Phoenix's sex master got murdered, she may seem like a kawaii & sexeh [[slut|girl]] who always gets her fucking way, but when she doesn't get her way she shall become an aggressive [[bitch]] who, upon revealing the god of anger in her crotch, gets everyone so scared even Edgeworth will [[piss]] in his pants. In court she tries to pin the murder of Mia on Maya, but [[fail]]s because of lack of the lulz in the testimony she gives. Her pimp [[Gay|Redd White]] was found guilty of the murder, but he died as [[an hero|a hero]] [[Shit nobody cares about|because he was involved in the DL-6 incident.]]

====The Judge====
A [[retard|geriatric brainless clueless dickless bag of horse testicles]] who learned everything he knows about law [[Last Thursday]]. Needs everything explained to him [[over 9000]] times before he understands what's going on, then still doesn't know exactly what it means. Naturally he's biased towards the prosecution, as all good judges are, and basically wails on you with legalese whenever you fuck up (read: all the time). He also [[b&]] Phoenix's ass from the courtroom 7 years before PW4 for forged evidence. He enjoys talking to those he takes a liking to [[lemon party|in his chambers]].

[[lol wut|He also has a somehow Canadian brother]], but he doesn't show up until the third game.

[[Image:PWAATT3.png|thumb|left|This isn't a game, it's a [http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=fgTZdQ-u5Hc GODDAMN BOOK.] What, do you have to READ to beat the levels?]]

====Damon Gant====
The Chief of Police and owner of the patented 'Gant Stare™'. Invites people to go [[sex|swimming]] on a regular basis, and is in a long-term relationship with Gourdy, the local tentacle monster. He WILL [[rape]] you and you will like it. He eventually got [[party_van|v&]] when Phoenix discovered several lolis tied up in his basement.  Oh, and he [[rape|murdered]] a guy with a [[penis|knife]], too.
The famous Gant scene everyone knows and loves involves him holding a 15-year-old hostage and [[pedophile|having a chat with her]] as Phoenix goes off to [[sex|investigate something]] [[penis|about]] [[rape|Edgeworth's]] [[penis|past]] [[ya rly|or something.]]

He is also a Blitz from the ''Devil May Cry'' games.

===PW2: [[Electric Boogaloo|Justice For All]]===
[[capslock|*WARNING*]] This game has the biggest collection of faggots outside of Kingdom Hearts. You have been warned!

====[[lolicon|Pearl Fey]]====
Maya's [[lolicon|younger cousin]] and a blatant Nick*Maya [[ship|shipper]], Pearls has to be one of the only people on the face of the planet to not realize Phoenix's (jailhouse) [[gay|gayness]]. Which isn't much of a surprise since she's so stupid that she thinks spelling [[dyslexia| I AM reads as AMI]] . Then again, her abusive mother's drunken fist probably knocked any common sense out of the kid's brain. Since she's [[shotacon|Cody Hackins]]' age they are automatically [[ship|madly in love]] with each other, though they have never met. [[incest|Has a boner for her artist aunt]].

====Franziska von Karma====
Manfred von Karma's hellspawn and rejected Castlevania character/[[BDSM]] queen. Decided not to stay in the kitchen and left Germany to [[rape|kick]] Phoenix's ass for making Miles [[gay]]. She carries around a whip [[Attention Whore|to prove she is superior]], <s> and it always works out because she is a powerful and intimidating woman </s> [[What is a man?|and to prove your words are as empty as your soul,]] but it always [[epic|epically]] [[fail|phails]]. Grew up with Miles and calls him "Little Brother", [[incest|but is somehow paired with him anyways]], or Adrian Andrews, which makes for hot lesbian dickings. FOOLFOOLISHFOOLHEARTYFOOLERY!!!112 is pretty much her lame attempt at having a catchphrase.

====[[Jeffree Star|Max Galactica]]====
[[Image:Really do not want.jpg|thumb|[[Do not want|A poor soul being exposed to Max Galactica for the first time.]]]]
[[gay|The]] [[gay|only]] [[gay|reason]] [[gay|he's]] [[gay|worth]] [[Hard_Gay|mentioning]] [[gay|is]] [[gay|because]] [[gay|he]] [[gay|is]] [[gay|the]] [[gay|second]] [[gay|gayest]] [[faggot|character]] [[gay|in]] [[gay|the]] [[gay|entire]] [[faggotry|series]]. [[gay|He]] [[gay|wears]] [[gay|pink]] [[gay|clothes]], [[Lazy_Town|has pink hair]], [[gay|says]], [[gay|"Fantabulous!"]] [[gay|and/or]] [[gay|"Fabulous!"]] [[gay|and]] [[gay|calls]] [[gay|Phoenix]] [[cockmongler|sweetie]], [[gay|and]] [[gay|for]] [[gay|some]] [[gay|reason]], [[lie|proposes to a girl.]] [[wtf|What the fuck?]]

====Regina Berry====
The daughter of a ringmaster, and also an animal trainer. Has no sense of emotions until the end when she cries like a little bitch. Every [[pedo|grown man]] wants to [[rape|marry]] her, despite the fact that the game says [[Loli|she's 16]]. (Max, it seems, even passed her enough of [[gay|The Gay]] to make Maya [[lesbian|les]] for her, resulting in her becoming the star of their own [[rape|private bedroom act]].)
Has a bigass [[Tatiana_the_Tiger|tiger]] named [[rapist|Regent]] and a [[lion]] named [[shit no one cares about|something obvious]] that pwns her stupid boyfriend.

====Benjamin [[Erection|Woodman]]====
A [[pedophile|ventriloquist]] with a [[retard|speech impediment]], that refuses to talk to you without his [[sock puppet|puppet]], Trilo Quist. [[Rape|Proposes]] to [[16_year_old_girl|Regina]], in spite of the fact he is [[pedo|twice her age]]. Because of this he got [[rape|hit]] in the [[ass|face]] by [[Jeffree Star|Max]].  Asides from this he's the most boring and most [[useless human|fucking useless]] character in the entire fucking series. Even his puppet thinks he sucks. He also bears an uncanny resemblance to Pee-Wee Herman.

====Ken [[Cockmongler]] (A.K.A. [[faggot|Acro]])====
A circus freak [[cripple]] who used to be [[over 9000|an acrobat]] until he attempted to save his brother from being attacked by a [[JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR!|lion]] and [[fail|failed]] epicly because he didn't make it to the car in time. Acro has the super power to cry [[cum|milk]].  Because he is now useless without his legs, he lives in a [[basement_dweller|basement]] and makes his pet black person [[50 Cent|Money]] [[rape|do]] his [[in the ass|dirty work]] for him such as kill [[Wilford Brimley]].  [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:SongOfMyPeople.jpg This is what he used to look like before the accident.]  Yes, he also can sing and play the violin [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:GAY.jpg and this was his brother.]

====Matt Engarde====
Matt works as the [[porno|Nickel Samurai]], likes drinking [[shit|chocolate milk]] and fapping to snuff films, and [[cutter|scratches his face up]] when [[Waaaambulance|things don't go his way]].  Don't be fooled by his [[nice_guy|"goody two shoes"]] act, because the [[truth|true]] Matt Engarde is a [[sick fuck]]. He's also the defendant of the last case, who (in a completely unexpected twist) actually committed the [[rape|crime]] - pretty much the only reason he's interesting.

====Juan [[masturbate|Corrida]]====
Possibly the most famous victim in the history of ever. Probably because his name can translate into "ejaculate." You never actually see the guy, but [[sick fuck|Matt]] and his [[sex|story]] is absolutely hilarious. In short, Matt [[rapes|dates]] some [[whore|ugly]] [[bitch|assistant]] and promptly after a [[rape|date]] Matt dumps her cos she has crabs. The girl gets upset and begs to stay with him, but he will have [[stfu|none of it]]. Corrida finds her in a gutter passed out and [[rapes|proposes to her]]. But then he changes his mind because he finds out Matt [[gay|did her first.]] The girl goes all [[emo|emo]] and [[lynch|hangs herself]]. [[shit no one cares about|Very sad.]]
Then Matt has a [[gentleman]] assassin [[pwn|kill]] Juan, but he lives on in our hearts. [http://www.drdowasure.com/images/phoenixwright/MattJuanontop.JPG Oh, and here.]

===PW3: Trials And Ejaculations===
tl;dp Maya's mother was alive the whole time but gets killed by Godot in the final case. You're welcome!

====Godot====
Known as the series' ultimate <s>[[douchebag]]</s> winner. He reads ''Maxim'', has a fucking [[epic]] scouter on his face, calls people broham, likes ''[[anime|InuYasha]]'', and is a rabid [[furry]]. Not only that, but he hits on [[lolicon|little girls]]. [[Srsly]]. Game 3, case #5. [[Habeeb_it|See for yourself]].

====Ron Delite====
A crazy, delusional, fangirl obsessed with [[halo|master thief]] Mask DeMasque.  She brings a new degree of retard to her already [[batshit insane]] fangirlism that would even make [[Twilight]] fans blush! She does this by actually wanting to go to jail so everyone believes she's really Mask DeMasque! She's also the only character in the Phoenix Wright series who is a certified [[trap]] because everyone keeps referring to her as a he.

====Luke Atmey====
The [[batshit insane|batshit crazy]], [[cockmongler]] of a [[dick]]-tective. His nose is [[over 9000]] feet long and he occasionally [[rape|rapes]] Ron DeLite and her tranny-loving wife, Desiree with it. He has a monacle practically glued to his goddamn face, and dresses like the Penguin from [[Batman|Batman]]. Secretely, he wants to [[rape|screw]] Mia Fey (only if you present her profile to him) and every other woman PW ships in from Tijuana. Openly [[wank|wanks]] in public (Seriously, [http://www.court-records.net/animation/atmey-twitch(b).gif Check it out], [http://www.court-records.net/animation/atmey-break(c).gif this guy really fucking enjoys himself]). Don't fuck with him though, he [[the Matrix|knows Atmey-Fu]].

====Jean Armstrong====
[[Image:BIG GAY CHEF by MinionofSloth.jpg|thumb|[[Rule 34|No exceptions!]]]]
Even gayer than Max Galactica. He's a French [[gay|aromatherapist]] who runs a shitty overpriced restaurant and [[shemale|thinks he's a girl]] while attracting sparkles and rose petals and shit. At the beginning of case #3 in game 3, he wants to fuck Phoenix's [[fursona|doppelganger]], Mexican

====[[Furry|Furio Tigre]]====
A Yankee who, while tanning on an all-male nude beach, got a massive sunburn. Vents his frustration by beating Jean Armstrong on a regular daily basis for not having his money. He's Violetta Cadaverini's bitch and world famous Al Pacino impersonator, how he got a hold of Phoenix's [[raver|hairstyle]] is currently [[semen|unknown]].

====Dahlia Hawthorne====
She's the [[troll|antagonist]] of the whole third game. Daughter of a Jew-eler and Phoenix's [[bitch]] when he was a college stoner. Still holds a grudge against him because the <strike>fire-breathing dragon</strike> [[centipede filled vagina|centipedes]] that live in her vagina turned him [[gay]]. She forces her [[pedo]] lover to become [[an hero]], gets her stepsister killed, [[drugs|poisons]] Diego, and offs another boyfriend after he finds out she was stealing his [[drugs|stuff]]. Gets [[pwned]] by a noose in the end. Comes back from the dead afterwards, but quickly crawls back to [[Hell]] to suck [[Satan]]'s massive [[cock]] when Mia tells her how much she fucking [[fail]]s at life (and death, incidentally) and how small her [[tits]] are compared to hers. [[lulz|She tried to murder Maya]]  but failed and instead got channeled through Maya's mom [[Spoiler|who was really Elise Deauxnim in disguise]], [[epic fail|but then got re-channeled through Maya Fey and thus foiling her evil plan.]] [[shit nobody cares about|She's the daughter of Morgan Fey from Justice For All]], [[trolling|and tried to frame Phoenix Wright for murder and kill him]]. Because of this she is considered to be the [[pretty cool guy|coolest character in the series.]]

====Iris Hawthorne====
Dahlia's sister and personal bitch. She went [[emo]] and [[shit nobody cares about|spent her time crying her eyes out as a nun since Dahlia decided she isn't a good slave anymore]]. Apparently wasn't aware of Phoenix's [[faggot|faggotism]] and wants inside his pants. [[lolwut|Was apparently pretending to be Dahlia when she was dating Phoenix]] in order to help her make him [[an hero]]. In the end, <s>her true love for him</s> his faggotism was too much and she betrayed her psycho sister, which caused Dahlia to kill another guy by again raping him. She does become his bitch in the end, causing many [[pedophile|Phoenix/Maya]] shippers to fly in to a massive shit-storm about it, generating many lulz. Trolling them is easy-just say the relationship's canon, and LOL as they [[nerd rage|break their computer]] over how "ZOMG WRONG U ARE".

Note that Iris's sprite in the game is a recolor of Dahlia, showing how [[fail|creative]] the producers were.

====The Judge's Canadian Brother====
Just like we said. He is [[Canadian]] and, therefore, not worth mentioning, though he has a ton of bagged-milk jokes made at his expense.

====DieGO ArmanDO====
Proof that [[Satan|the almighty Crapcom]] thinks we're all [[retards]]. This guy is seriously Godot and nobody else. Ignore the hair, addictions, and grin. Seriously, who did you think he was? Spends all of 3-4 trying to get in Mia's bra. Has a thing for [[a_cat_is_fine_too|cats]]. One of the series' only seemingly straight characters. [[Pervert]], but it's innuendo, so it's [[awwright|A-OK.]]

Unseen Moral: If a Hispanic offers you coffee candy, there will be [[rape|sex]] involved.  Enjoy your [[AIDS]].

Fun Fact: Invert Godot's colors.. SURPRISE!

===PW4: Apollo Justice===

In the wake of the success of the first three installments in the Phoenix Wright series, Capcom did what any good game company would do: they decided to cynically milk the series for all it was worth and spend less time, effort and money to make the next installments in the series, and completely fuck over their customer base.  Great job, Capcom!

Apollo Justice is rife with shallow, annoying, inhuman characters that inspire murderous rage in all who have the misfortune of watching them.  They make the characters from Dragon Ball Z look like they stepped right out of the grandest Shakespearian drama.  Nothing they say or do in any way resembles even the most disturbed or psychotic human behavior.  Their mannerisms and speech make the late Michael Jackson's feathery falsetto voice, eye-batting and crotch-grabbing look like the most grounded, natural human behavior ever to have existed.  

Thus, in the tradition of the Legend of Zelda series, the Breath of Fire series, and many others, Capcom has ruined a once-great series and fucked over its customers, proving once again that it has nothing but the vilest contempt for its customers, and probably for the rest of humanity as well.

====Apollo Justice (obviously)====
The Attorney formerly known as Lawboy Fagsgay, Herr Forehead, Sleeves, and "That guy with the hair", and is the brand spanking new main character of GS4. Why? Because [[nobody|everybody]] needed a break from the old characters and Naruhobo is hilarious and fun to say if you're [[Wapanese]]. He's set up to defend Phoenix in a few cases, which is a fucking waste of time due to the fact Feenie starts defending himself since Herr Forehead is a useless noob. Why did they bother replacing him again?

Polly is a freaking wimp afraid of heights, panties, loud noises, head-masturbation (see Daryan Crescend), panties, Mr. Hat, panties, salt, unicorn horns, gangsta ABDs, panties, stepladders, panties, and panties. He's too new to be made fun of too much but is definitely [[gay]] (see case 2 game 4). Goes on a magical tic-seeking adventure via putting his nose on his [[drugs|bracelet]] and inhaling deeply. Incidentally he can use his bracelet to summon magic powers that tell when someone's acting suspicious...which is probably the second-dumbest magic power ever besides [[Aquaman|talking to fucking FISH]].

====[[Dickhead|Daryan Crescend]]====
Has an absolutely fucking ridiculous hairstyle. Yes, it's a Japanese game, but still, look at it. [http://www.court-records.net/animation4/daryan-stroke.gif Fucking LOOK at it]. He probably masturbates with a comb. [[Satan|The Almighty Capcom]] claims he was based off a shark. Shark - that's the first thing you think when you see him. [[Cock|S-h-a-r-k]].

Is gay for [[lolicon|Machi]] and [[cockmongler|Klavier]] at the same time. [[Rapes]] a blind bitch after she fingered him in court and then hairbutts her [[for the lulz]]. Has some convoluted scheme to kidnap the President's son to feed his hairdick and take over the world, but his involvement is revealed when they discover that [[fail|he can't fucking play guitar]]. Also something about cocoon drugs and little blind human traffickers.

[[Image:Klavierisgaaaay.jpg |thumb|Klavier hitting on Apollo.]]

====Ema Skye====
Ema Skye originally appeared in the first game as a [[16-year-old girl]] who masturbated to science textbooks. The only reason she existed was to serve as a Maya replacement, but she added something new to the bland formula: science. Yes, folks, science. This "science" took place in boring minigames that involved tapping on the screen and screaming into the microphone. Now she's a bitter [[bitch]] because she didn't get the job she wanted. She'll show up whenever the game gets bored of itself and decides to mix-up the [[lie|action]] with more dull minigames and an [[eating disorder]], because those are always hilarious. She would later go on to become one of [[/v/]]'s most annoying [[tripfags]].
Many fans usually ship her and the [[faggot]] below, despite the fact that they barely speak to each other informally,[[Ship|and even then they share all of one line with each other]]. If you look into these people, you'll find they all ship the same boring-ass pairings. Though, it could be worse. They could be [[yaoi]] fans. Seriously, the only way those two would be together is if he wore an Edgeworth mask, seeing as how she wants inside Edgeworth's pants all the time.

====Klavier Gavin====
Easily summed up as "That [[gay|glimmerous]] [[fop]]", or "The [[AIDs|Flaming]] Guitar". [[lie|Proof that playing your own theme song makes you instantly hot if you're German.]] Very, very [[pedo|gay]] for Apollo, and flirts with anything. Calls Trucy a [[jailbait|"Delicious Morsel".]] Would be creepy if he weren't so damn sexy. Covers his Apollo fantasies by picking on the hungover detective. Has the hereditary Unicorn Hair. His virgin love may or may not have been a jar of pickled onions.

====Kristoph Gavin====
Apollo's mentor, dominatrix, and That Guy everyone spoiled themselves on months before the game's release. So you should already know he's the Guy Who Did [[WTC|It]] in Cases 1 and 4. Killed [[GAR|Zak Gramarye]] with a fucking bottle cause he beat him in poker. Also rapes Vera Misham in the ass when she was [[lolicon|12 years old]] and then poisons her father Drew Misham with a stamp because he's fucking [[insane|batshit insane]] and loves little girls, and man ass. Also could be called "That [[gay|glitterous]] [[fop]]". Is pretty much GS4's Mia, sans boobs. Suffers from Unicorn Head, Despair, and Demon-Infected Hand.

====Trucy Wright====
Yet another Loli in the series, she's Phoenix's adopted daughter and Apollo's [[incest|half sister]]. Is GS4's Maya, but even more dim-witted, though she's a magician practicing fake magic, whereas Maya summons fucking dead people, most of which are psychotic killers. Is surprisingly enthusiastic about showing Apollo her magic panties.

====[[O rly|Olga <strike>Orgy</strike> Orly]]====
Never mind her name. This bitch posed as a Russian waitress at the restaurant Hobo Phoenix plays piano at, when she's really a [[Yu-Gi-Oh|card]] [[SUCK MY DICK|shark]] who looks more like a fucking [[pirate]]. Had a deal with Zak Gramarye to plant cards in Phoenix's poker hand to catch him [[infidelity|"cheating,"]] but he used the Heart of the Cards, so Zak hit her with a bottle. Claims to have [[masturbation|"quick fingers."]]

====Wocky Kitaki====
A fucking [[wigger]], son of a Mob boss, and runner-up for GS4's Most Fucking Ridiculous [[cock|Hairstyle]]. Has a fatal injury that doesn't seem to bug him too much, until Dr. Eldoon comes in and it comes this close to [[rape|going Trauma Center on us.]] He also has trouble telling the difference between [[cake|pastries]] and [[white people|crackers]], which makes us wonder if he's ever done anything more than getting shot and dating [[batshit insane]] women.

====[[lolicon|Machi Tobaye]]====
He no speek [[engrish]] much but <strike>he duz [[tranny|crossdresser]] gud. Sucky sucky five dorrah!</strike> No, that was Trucy's [[fabulous]] magic uncle.

Talks in some made up gibberish thing where one of the letters is a [[gay|suggestively posed]] man that was probably based off an embarrassing Edge-Wright [[yaoi]] pic. His one true moment of fame is when he sets Klavier's guitar on fire on Dickhead Guitar's orders, after his hair finished eating its lettuce salad.

====Lamiroir====

Possibly the most annoying character this side of the /b/tards, at 1st she acts like she can't speak, then she says she can see then that [[gay|glimmerous]] [[fop]] throws a bomb shell out the shes the blind bitch, more or less [[mind fuck]]s every noob on 4chan thats ever fapped to her hawtness. Was Apollo and Trucy's mom for those of you who wanna get a good incest boner off rule 34. She's the one that gave Apollo his dick brace that lets him look closer at chicks' cleavages. Before she was shipped off to ______istan to become a stripper at the local Hooters, she was a magician that got gunned down by her abusive second husband and her gay secret admirer while they practiced a new trick that was already a good show.


===Ace Attorney Investigations: [[faggot|Miles Edgeworth]]===

The latest installment in the Ace Attorney series, and like its title character, the gayest game to date. You will spend your time connecting various aspects of each crime scene to one another to form logic that even a three year old with down syndrome could conclude after a quick glance at its surroundings. You will be kidnapped by criminals so incompetent that they spend their time killing each other instead of properly making sure that there is no possible way you can escape. You will be hit on repeatedly by a batshit old lady and your incompetent detective sidekick even though you treat him like shit.

====Miles Edgeworth====

After being fucked by Phoenix one too many times in the court, he has lost all his pimpliness and is now terrified to even step in the courtroom or mention his former lover by name. Instead, he refers to him cryptically, saying only that [[sex|"he must be rubbing off on me."]] For some reason, no woman is able to understand that he is gayer than a fucking rainbow, and he is hit on repeatedly throughout the game. Also expresses his displeasure by dramatically screaming "NGROOOOOOOOOO!" like a sissy little girl.

====[[Rihanna|Dick Gumshoe]]====

The [[Epic Fail Guy]] of the Ace Attorney series. Everybody laughs at his poverty, his desperate attempts to get Edgeworth to fuck him, and his general incompetence, reminding us all what sick fucks we really are. He also spends a good amount of time getting the shit beaten out of him by a thirteen year old girl. In fact, the only two characters that don't berate him every five minutes are a skinny pussy who is even more incompetent than Gumshoe, and a seven year old.

==Shipping==
Like any <strike>decently popular</strike> completely [[fail]] game, this one does not have protection to the legions of annoying [[Ship|shippers]] and [[fangrils]] arguing about how their OTP is the best. Not only that, but these are some of the most fucked up pairings I have ever seen. Nercophilia, Pedophilia, Incest-you name it, this game has a pairing for it.

All you really need to know is Phoenix has been paired with [[retard|EVERY PERSON IN THIS GAME]]. Serisouly, this is no joke. Go look it up.

Trolling any of these shippers is simple enough (except for the Phoenix/Mike Meekins shippers, mind you). All you need to do is say that their relationship isn't canon. This will generate the largest [[lol|lulz]], due to the fact they can't argue against it.

==[[obvious|Is Klavier gay?]]==
[[Image:Klavierisgaaaay.jpg |thumb|OBJECTION: I HAVE PROOF [[faggot|FGT]]]]

In a certain scene in Apollo Justice, the otherwise [[lie|complete ladies' man]] Klavier had his sexuality called in to question. In this scene, he believes that Apollo is [[lol wut|checking him out]], and proceeds to say the following-

{{quote|I'm used to being inspected by the ladies... but [[WTF|this is the first time I've felt this way with a man.]]|Actual quote from Klavier at the time of the incident.}}

Of course, his cult following of fangirls, allied with the [[retards]] that ship KlavierxEma, immediately started shooting down the claims, to no effect-as the producers of the [[lulz]] (who came to this conclusion in the first place) found unlikely allies in the [[yaoi]] fangirls. that's right-lulz and yaoi fangirls working together. [[WTC|Apoccalypse much?]] The debate spawned much [[butthurt]] and [[lulz]] across the interwebs.
