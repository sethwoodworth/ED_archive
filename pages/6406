'''Pickbothmanlol''' is a bored [[13 year old boy]] on the internets who decided to be the newest [[Willy on Wheels]]/[[Grawp]] wannabee. He is now banned as of June 26.

==Newgrounds==
[[File:OW ND3.gif|thumb|Pickbothmanlol thinks that this crap is lulz worthy.]]

Pickbothmanlol is an attention-seeking [[Newgrounds]] user who's obsessed with [[Total Drama Island]]. He claims to be a [[13-year-old boy]], but he probably just says that so he won't be mocked for his love of kiddie cartoons on Nickelodeon and cartoon Network. Pickbothmanlol claims to be the creator of [[Dancing Owen]], which [[Forced meme|he claims to be a "meme"]]. Pickbothmanlol even created an [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] article on his supposed creation in a futile attempt to spread the meme beyond his little circle of friends at Newgrounds. Pickbothmanlol believes that he had trolled the creators of Total Drama Island this "meme", which he thinks is his claim to fame, but the truth is that no one gives a shit.

==Origins==
After trolling around on the English [[Wikipedia]] while pretending to "contribute", PBML was blocked and unblocked 3 times before finally being banned for [[vandalism]] and [[Sock|socking]]. His trolling included making fraudulent [[AfD]] nominations and other intentional incompetence.

==Trolling==
Pickbothmanlol has been known for [[fail|copying off]] over more successful trolls including their own editing habits. Despite this, indications of [[lulz]] are had from ANI topics about him. One such example was using one sock to include a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive597#Main_Edges_use_of_swastikas_in_signature. swastika in his signature] and the other to bitch about him being a [[Nazi]] which resulted in a long debate.

For [[lulz|shits and giggles]], he did more than [[troll]] ANI, he even [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Zink_Dawg nominated an unsuspecting user for adminship] only to change the nominator's vote from support to neutral. He has also made attempts to troll [[Chris-chan]] with a Sonichu game knowing that this shit has been done before.

==Joint Attack on Wikis==
The first attack. "Operation [[Fail|Full Troll]]" was made late July 2010, PBML and [[Hagger]] were spotted on a small wiki devoted to a [[shit]]ty [[Flash]] game made for [[12 years old]] boys called "''[[Transformice]]''". The community considered locking down the wiki to stop [[proxy]] abuse, but were ultimately done in by their own badly-programmed [[bot]]. The wiki has since returned and added a [[CAPTCHA]] to prevent mass vandalism. Only time will tell if it actually works. 
===The Wikimedia saga===
PBML who shortly was unblocked twice after an [[IRC]] convo decided to declare war on [[Simple Wikipedia]]. Unlike [[TOW]], it's [[Retarded|simple]] counterpart had a weakness that could give him the edge he needed to establish control for a short while as the leader of the [[fags|Committee of Users]] who shared hatred for [[bureaucratic fuck]]s and the site's government. [[Recent changes patrol|Vandalism on Recent Changes]] is the dream of any vandal as without it, Wikipedia would be almost stripped of its anti-vandalism [[vaginas|defenses]]. Despite that sentence, this was not the first time it was done, with Willy being the first to do it. Pickbothmanlol even went right up and stole the exact same diff.

[[Image:Pbml.jpg|right|180px|thumb|This was the only visible part of the site during it's short life on Recent Changes.]]
After continuing his incredible drive by of [[lulz]], PBML decided that this was not enough and decided to propose the [[final solution]] to Commons. Unlike Simple, Commons was both unprotected in the main page and the Recent Changes which doubled the drama to like four. Seeing this once in a lifetime chance to show the full extent of his [[l33t]] editing skills made him shit his pants. The plan was a failure despite the fact that the vandalism was win because he was not [[cool|auto-confirmed]].
===The CWCki saga===
What started out as a stupid prank call from [[Pickbothmanlol]] to [[Christian Weston Chandler]] ended up with PBML trying to start a personal army called the Swastika Legion ([[Nazi|which Chris obviously doesn't understand what a swastika is]]). PBML demanded that Chris should make a [[vlog|Captain's Log]] telling his '''[[Trolls|TRUE and HONEST]] fanbase''' to help with an attack on CWCki. Because [[Truth|Chris thinks everyone is a troll]], he did not do this, and thus made Pickbothmanlol [[BAWWWWW]].

Another raid was done on a local wiki made to document Chris-chan regardless of Chris's participation. A retaliatory demonstration of a bonnet by the Wikifags have since spooked The Order of the Pro (PBML's "Legion")into disabling registration, and banning PBML for having thrown them in as his personal army. Proving, that no matter how tested a formula PBML uses, he will always fail. Screen shots here http://img805.imageshack.us/img805/3681/pbmlpersonalarmyfail.jpg 
PBML soon showed just how badly he failed by, approaching the CWCiki and asking for a "ceasefire" .

This stunt also made the owner of the wiki to release a statement on to the forum, thanking them for their good use of the [[banhammer]] on Pickbothmanlol, although it is most likely a fucking troll.

==[[Wikia]] and Encyclopedia Dramatica==
Pickbothmanlol was not confined to Wikipedia and other sites managed by [[Wikimedia]]; he was also a terror to any wiki on Wikia that was dumb enough to leave the templates on the Recent Changes unprotected including Memory Alpha and [[Star Wars Fanon]] which resulted in a six minute lock down. The downside is that Wikia monitors your [[porn|shit]] 24/7 which means it would not put up with the shit that he does on Wikipedia.

Pickbothmanlol also made the unfortunate mistake of vandalizing ED. Unlike the good faith assumers from TOW, we will pound this little shit to the ground.
