[[Image:Kuzco.jpg|thumb|250px|"it was not an easy task to accomplish! Kuzco is not the usual tall dark and handsome kind of guy, he's not really nice (at first) and he's so skinny - not my type at all! :D But he's got one thing that always works - he is hilarious! And so full of himself - the perfect material for a Disney Hero Model!"]]

On [[Never forget|October 6,]] [[2009]], [[ohnotheydidnt]] released what could be their worst abomination ever: freakishly well-drawn and airbrushed [[gay|male]] [[Disney]] characters in speedos. Apparently, these pics are [[ancient|years old]], but the [[internet hate machine]] had somehow largely missed out on them so far.

These were all drawn with incredible [[faggotry|detail]] by {{deviantart|davidkawena|David Kawena}}, an [[Israeli]] [[faggot]] in his mid-twenties. Obviously, he has a thing for drawing these "[[ugly|attractive]]" males from various Disney films, while leaving out the "[[beautiful|ugly]]" ones such as [[Quasidan|Quasimodo]] from ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' like a stereotypically biased fuck. <s>Unfortunately</s> Thankfully, [[furry|things]] like ''[[The Lion King]]'' [[bawww|are left out]].

Since posted on David's DeviantART, these images have been posted in numerous places, including [http://www.lemondrop.com/2009/10/14/who-is-the-hottest-disney-prince/ lemondrop.com], [http://tasteofapoisonparadise.blogspot.com/2009/10/this-aint-ya-mamas-disney-prince.html some latina's blogger], [http://allieiswired.com/archives/2009/10/disney-princes-gone-wild-photos/ allieiswired.com] and other places that should not be linked [http://www.myspace.com/ lest they make your eyes bleed]. However awkward the content of these pictures is, it appears that they get numerous page-views from [[Cougar|soccer moms]] with too much time on their hands.

What you are about to see will either shock you so badly you'll need to spend thousands of [[jew gold|dollars]] on [[eye bleach|hypnotherapy]], or leave you rather [[gay|aroused]] and wishing the artist had a request box.

|I won't be able to watch another Disney Princess movie without remembering this post... feeling REALLY awkward >_|{{ljuser|agent_cavendish}} (who apparently is a cyclops)
|Definitely. But this is way less awkward than the time I was 11 and wanted to print a picture of Aladdin and Jasmine and google images turned up porn drawings of them and I mean, they were pretty graphic drawings. Now I think they're lol-worthy but I've had ten years to laugh about it...|{{ljuser|dude_isotopes}} (who now has fap material for another ten years)
|And did you notice Gaston's got big balls and a little itty-bitty dick?|{{ljuser|cleojones}} (this can never be unlearned.)
|I always had a crush on Eric from The Little Mermaid. My inner perv and inner child are both celebrating right now.  Separately, of course. I don't have an inner Chris Hansen to handle that situation.|{{ljuser|deadendqueen16}} RIIIIIIGHT
|I was..erm...attracted to Aladdin, Peter Pan...Simba and Carpet|{{ljuser|ace_nikkel}}
|um what the fuq I do not want any of these scantily clad men. this is such a turnofff omg. but I guess the princesses have been sexualized ever-so-much so it is only fair to do the same to the princes. but gross. that dude from atlantis's glasses are seriously turning me the fuq off idk idk get better taste in eyewear, hunnay|{{ljuser|totalroyalty}} [[wat|(offering fashion advice to cartoons since 1997)]]
