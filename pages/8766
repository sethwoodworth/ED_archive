Vanity search
A '''vanity search''', also known as '''ego-surfing''', is typing one's own name into a search engine, usually [[Google]], to find out how often and where they are mentioned. Often used by [[attention whore]]s to find out if they are e-loved, and by assholes who think any mention of their IRL name is [[copyright infringement]] or some shit.

Any search of one's real name will reveal that the people who share your name are, almost exclusively, sweaty, bearded [[retard]]s.
