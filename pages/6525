Pop Culture
{{pixplz}}

Once upon a time there was a thing called [[culture]]. Then movies, radio, and television were invented, and real culture was replaced by "pop culture". 

'''Pop Culture''' ([[lazy|short]] for '''popular culture''') was invented in the [[hippies|1960s]] by a [[gaylord]] artist named [[fag|Andy Warhol]] (who also popularised [[AIDS]]) when he discovered that you can indeed fool [[Americunts|all of the people all of the time]] when he started selling shitty sketches of Campbell's Soupâ„¢ cans and [[Anna Nicole Smith]] for obscene amounts of money. 

At the moment, Pop Culture includes every vapid [[hip|fad]] from [[art]] movements to musical [[crap|genres]] like [[emo]] to [[memes]] to celebrities like [[OJ Simpson]] to language such as "[[Don't Taze Me Bro]]". However, since popular culture by definition encapsulates what is currently 'popular', today's Pop Culture is tomorrow's [[Old School]] or [[Retro]].

It can be defined as any damn thing in the past 100 years that has been quoted and spoofed and put on a fucking [[Hot Topic]] t-shirt over and over until any intelligent person wants invent a time machine and go back to the 1950s when Pop Culture was just known as stuff (truckers' hats for example). But the majority of people in the world are a bunch of easily-entertained [[Aspies]] who will smile and laugh at anything that's familiar to them. 

Because everyone is out of fucking original ideas, pop culture is frequently regurgitating itself over and over. Many TV shows (most notably [[Family Guy]]) are popular because of this regurgitating. The human race loves familiarity over quality, it seems.


== Notable Shows/channels/websites that use Pop Culture as a substitute for actual humor ==

== Is there any way to stop the endless regurgitation? ==
Sadly, no. As long as there are giggling [[retard]]s (like [[User:Dr. Strangelurk|me]]) who will buy or watch something because "OMG I remember that LMAO!", pop culture will continue to eat itself up and vomit itself up again. The only way to stop this is to kill 99.9% of the population (the remaining .1% being people who enjoy original ideas and actual humor). Until that happens, losers like me will continue to sit back in our [[Monty Python]] T-shirts, drinking JOLT cola and watching "I Love The [[1980s|80s]]"

Alternatively, [[you]] could do something proactive, and get away from Pop Culture the [[suicide|easy way]].

==Some help==
Feeling like your [[Mindfuck|head is going to explode]] if you see or hear any [[moar]] [[Perez Hilton]] and Family Guy? Well you may be in luck.

Invariably, a twangy [[inbred|country singer/songwriter]] will come along and oversimplify things in a semi-humorous manner. Although the [[lulz]] are only moderate... because if the lulz were great, the above section would cause a [[time paradox]]. In any case, songs [[I accidentally X|can will to will]] help [[shit|alleviate some stress.]]
