'''Cakepony''' is a [[porn]] site that disguises itself to look suitable to children in order to get a bonar from the cute little girls' reactions, thus making it a pretty average porn site. Upon entering the site, the [[fag|innocent surfer]] is prompted with pretty pictures that appeal of children of all target ages, i.e. 1 to 8. The site asks if the viewer is 'a foal', asking the viewer to leave if so, or a 'yearling', which are permitted to enter the magical land of Cake Pony. These are apparently some complicated [[furry]] aging systems that [[no one]] (except retarded fucks like [[you]]) understand. Should the small children not know which one to click, the 'yearling' option is usually taken, as it is 4 times larger than the 'foal'. This results in 4 times more small children watching the hawt [[pr0n]].


== The Cake pony doesn't want you to discover her hidden child pornography ==

The theme of this site is ironic, since at its core it is [[child pornography]]. The creators of the site want to hide the fact that they're making child pornography, by making everything into "cute" ponies usually marked as [[Baby Fuck|under a year old]] in thinly-veiled sexual positions. It's not porn- there's no [[penis]] involved! Really, it's totally [[CP|legal]], just like swapping pictures of child models. Yeah, like any site like this with the initials [[CP]] could be up to any good...

The images themselves are perfect [[loli]] bait. What little girl Doesn't love My Little Pony! [[Amirite]]? Oh, and [[delicious cake]].... nobody can resist the cake! All that's missing from this place is the van with "Free Candy" spray painted on the side and a friendly visit from [[Chris Hansen]] and his [[Party Van|friends]]. Pedobear loves and approves this site, funding it with his hard-earned money. 

There's also a lameass comic about ponies in space, to attempt to distract from all the disgusting near-porn, but we all know that [[You|someone]] is wanking to that, too, right now. 

If you don't believe it from the pictures, check out Cake Pony's Mission Statement for the full horror of the situation.
