Ianal
'''Ianal''' can be used to mean either:

# "Into [[anal sex|anal penetration]]" (see also [[IPN]]); or,
# "I am not a [[lawyer]]."
# "I am now a [[Internet lawyer|lawyer]]."
# "iAnal" (though this is obvious, as all [[Mac]] users are anal.)
Typically this latter claim is made as a [[dubious disclaimer]] before giving out shoddy, baseless [[Internet Law|legal advice]] on the [[Internets]].
