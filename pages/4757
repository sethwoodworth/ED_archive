<strike>Latin is an inflectional language that was created by [[Roman]]s in order to seduce their women, it was a direct descendant, and combining, of the Etruscan ''(another Italic tribe)'' and [[Greek]] languages.</strike> Latin is the name of the language used by the guys who ran the Roman Empire. It's distinct lack of native speakers makes it a so-called 'dead language' (viz., 'all the people who talked like this are dead') in linguistic terms. What this, essentially, means is that Latin is only used by [[dork|know-it-all]] [[Asshole|dickwad]]s that can't get it up; the [[emo|sad]] [[nerd|people]] who   [[insane|spend their fucking lives]] with Latin (or any other dead, basically useless language) are called 'philologists'. Latin has also been in use for centuries as an instrument of torture in schools; for example, [[Faggotry|Latin is taught]] in [[English]] fee paying schools (confusingly called Public Schools), and also sometimes [[gay|single gender]] schools. This is so that, should you meet or dig up a dead [[Roman]] in [[England]], you can at least [[flame]] him in his own language; the English example has its roots mainly in the blind adherence to that nation's obsession with [[Doctor Who]]. In [[Germany]], Latin is taught [[Fact|to remember the awesomeness that was the]] [[Hitler|Heilige Römische Reich Deutscher Nation]].
In general, it survived mainly as nerd-speak between [[geek|academics]] and as so-called 'kitchen Latin' (cf. [[Wicca|wiccans]], [[Magick|mages]], [[Satanism|satanists]], [[goths]] etc.); on the internet, it is encountered in a few distinct flavours (see below): ''"I know Latin, I has studied it"'' is one of the most widely spread ones and commonly used by [[pedobear|learned gentlemen]] in order to garner [[Sex|respect]] on the tubes from [[16-year-old girl|easily impressionable faggots]].  

For [[gay|male seduction]] by the Romans, please refer to the article on [[ad hominem]].

The Story: 
Latin's heart was lost in 370CE when Hypatia, Theon of Alexandria's daughter, was born.  Surviving texts from the time tell us that she was [[A Plus]] at science, and speculation by terminally bored [[nerd]]s is that she was ''probably'' hot.  Regardless, Latin was a hardcore [[pedophile]], and fell fatally in love with Hypatia's sweet one-minute old ass.

Latin committed [[suicide]] in 381CE when it discovered Hypatia had menstruated after the crazy [[bitch]] waved her bloody [[period]] rags in its face. [http://cosmopolis.com/alexandria/hypatia-bio-suda.html Seriously.]

==Contemporary Latin Use==
Today Latin is used primarily by three groups, two of which hate each other:

*Law students use a limited amount of Latin when they are not getting arrested for DWI (Latin [[fail|exams]] usually consist of crossword-puzzles and/or multiple-choice-tests for [[retards]]).

*[[Science|Scientists]] of all kinds, from biologists to philosophers, use Latin for all the important things - such as categorization of anything they see (Latin has better affixes than Diablo II, AND you can [[masturbate|call]] it [[Aspie|'taxonomy']], which makes it sound better than [[Aspie|'making lists']]!), and [[catchphrases]]; Astronomers (Greek, ''Astron'', lit. ''Star'') too, because all the planets and stars have Latin (or Greek) names such as '''"Sol"''' (solar, the Sun), '''Mars''' and "Earth's" proper scientific name is '''"[[earth|Terra]]"'''. How crazy is that? 

*The [[Catholic]] Church, in contrast, generally uses a mangled form of Latin to tell regular folk how evil they are, and for secret communicaes to its priests regarding taking it [[in the ass]].  The Vatican's [[Bible|manual]], written in Latin and fittingly called the [[unfunny|'Vulgata']], is considered the quintessential coffee-table book.

True to its roots, everybody that regularly employs Latin in normal speech is a hungry [[pedophile]].


Latin basically [[evolution|devolved]] into the "Romance Languages" such as [[French]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Romanian]], and [[Switzerland|Romansh]], [[Statistics|80%]] of [[English]], (some) [[German]],  ''et cetera''. ''Ergo'' one could say it never really died, unlike [[Africa|Punic]], which is undoubtedly dead and gone.

It is also used by film composers to create [http://anonym.to/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_%28soundtrack%29 AWESOME choral atmospheres] in Roman Shakespeare movie adaptations. (see track ''Victorius Titus'')

==Latin America==
Latin America is generally everything south of the [[United States]] and also [[Quebec|Québec]] [[Some argue|according to some]]. Latin Americans don't actually speak Latin, despite what you may assume, and instead take their name from their preference for young pussy.  Latin American women, in a desperate attempt to stay the rising incidents of pre-teen rape among their culture, invented the '[[Brazil|Brazilian wax]]' - an artificial method of looking like a hot piece of ten-year old [[cunt]]. 

Latin America's pre-teen rape incidents have since stabilized, and the culture is now known primarily for producing annoying pop-stars and incredibly ugly [[she-male]]s.

Latin is widely considered to be completely irrelevant to normal life and, like everyone who becomes irrelevant, is currently planning a globe-spanning comeback tour.  Ticket prices are expected to reach double figures.  [[Girlvinyl]], president of her [[shit nobody cares about|high school Latin club]], has already bought all the tickets.
