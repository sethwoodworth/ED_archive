[01:18] <SpexBluefox> oh right. Arbchat time.
[01:18] <deltro> arbchat in like 2m 
[01:18] <Blargh> is your name MIKE, spex?
[01:18] * weev sets mode: +pmSu-s
[01:19] * weev sets mode: -pmSu
[01:19] * weev sets mode: +s
[01:19] <SpexBluefox> Yea, it's mike
[01:19] * weev sets mode: +v SpexBluefox
[01:19] <dsdaf> :o
[01:19] <inDeme> D:
[01:19] <weev> ��THIS IS THE HONORABLE ANDREW R. WEEVLOS PRESIDING
[01:19] <Ego_Trip> serious business is about to ensue
[01:20] <SpexBluefox> alright alright
[01:20] <weev> SpexBluefox: Do you swear to tell the lulz, the whole lulz, and nothing but the lulz?
[01:20] <SpexBluefox> the whole point of this is cuse I was banned for being something I'm not
[01:20] <SpexBluefox> a Sockpuppet.
[01:20] <deltro> A HOMOSEXUAL FURRY?
[01:20] <SpexBluefox> And I think it's clear that I'm not Soki.
[01:20] * weev sets mode: +m
[01:20] <weev> okay
[01:20] <SpexBluefox> Nore do I speak for him
[01:20] <weev> So what exactly do you want?
[01:20] * A_RAPE_SPIDER is now known as A_RAPE_STENOGRAPHER
[01:20] <SpexBluefox> if it was Soki, he'd probably delete most of the article
[01:21] <weev> what is your ED username?
[01:21] <A_RAPE_STENOGRAPHER> Spex
[01:21] <weev> http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=SokiTwopaw&diff=1997163188&oldid=1997163183
[01:21] <weev> so
[01:21] <A_RAPE_STENOGRAPHER> User:Spex
[01:21] <weev> you're not Soki
[01:21] <weev> you're not speaking for Soki
[01:21] <weev> and you've never fucking contributed to our community before ever
[01:21] <SpexBluefox> I don't really know Soki that well. He's a friend of a friend.
[01:22] <weev> and yet you feel the need to decide what is appropriate to have on our website?
[01:22] <SpexBluefox> well I feel the need to make this country less lawyer happy.
[01:23] <weev> I'll have you know that I am a lawyer.
[01:23] <weev> And I will not have the arbchat courtroom made into some furry mockery
[01:23] <weev> so please excuse me as I take off my weevil fursuit
[01:23] <weev> as i'm no longer feeling quite so yiffy
[01:23] <SpexBluefox> aggreed
[01:24] <weev> SpexBluefox: Okay. Were you aware that I tried on multiple occasions to contact Soki?
[01:24] <weev> i called his house and left messages
[01:24] <SpexBluefox> I was not. What did he do when you tried?
[01:24] <weev> i sent messages to all his screennames
[01:24] <SpexBluefox> Acted like an arrogant ass, right?
[01:24] <weev> no
[01:24] <weev> he didnt respond
[01:24] <weev> and he hasn't come forward
[01:24] <weev> and he has voiced no objection to the material of the article
[01:24] <weev> so
[01:24] <SpexBluefox> welp, that'd be because he can very a jackass sometimes
[01:24] <weev> you admit that you're not soki, and you're not speaking for him
[01:25] <weev> and he himself hasn't come forward to voice any sort of objection
[01:25] <weev> so would you like to yiff upon the american flag in nazi armbands whilst screaming "HEIL HITLER"
[01:25] <weev> ???
[01:25] <SpexBluefox> I didn't remove that material on the grounds that it was Soki's. I removed it on the grounds that I wouldn't want lawyerness to come up ED.
[01:25] <weev> well sir
[01:26] <weev> as a lawyer who has passed the bar in four states
[01:26] <weev> i suggest that in the future you leave it to me to decide what exactly stays or leaves with regard to liability for ED
[01:26] <weev> we don't mind lawyers because we have several people on staff that are lawyers
[01:26] <weev> and frankly we know what brings us liability
[01:26] <weev> SpexBluefox: are you a lawyer?
[01:26] <weev> can you name a law that has been broken?
[01:26] <SpexBluefox> Fair enough Weev. No, I'm not.
[01:27] <weev> we will now take comments from the public
[01:27] * weev sets mode: -m
[01:27] <weev> �what does the public think?
[01:27] <JailBait> I think dongs.
[01:27] <A_RAPE_STENOGRAPHER> BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
[01:27] <ZombieG> it's bullshit.
[01:27] <JailBait> Lol, oh gos.
[01:28] <weev> JailBait: are you, or have you ever been a sympathizer of filthy, stinking kikes?
[01:28] * Pastorize has joined #arbchat
[01:28] <A_RAPE_STENOGRAPHER> I say its a sock/cocksheath of sokis
[01:28] <A_RAPE_STENOGRAPHER> and as such
[01:28] * Pastor has quit IRC (Ping timeout�)
[01:28] <inDeme> Public thinks, LULZ
[01:28] <ZombieG> Spex is an obvious inflatable furfag.  Move to dismiss and laff, create an article,, etc. etc.
[01:28] <A_RAPE_STENOGRAPHER> it should remain as is
[01:28] <JailBait> Are the kikes in questio, also greedy?
[01:28] <weev> i think stating greedy kike is sort of redundant.
[01:28] <SpexBluefox> bah. I don't care about the furriness that is me of my inflateyness. This isn't about that.
[01:29] <A_RAPE_STENOGRAPHER> indeed
[01:29] <JailBait> No, I have not
[01:29] <A_RAPE_STENOGRAPHER> oh but I think it is
[01:29] <weev> SpexBluefox: are you a jew? jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.
[01:29] <SpexBluefox> Point is, I'm not Soki. I was banned cuse people beleved I was Soki
[01:29] <weev> SpexBluefox: what are you looking at, sugar tits?
[01:29] <deltro> Spex wants cocks in it's asshole.
[01:29] <Ego_Trip> Although he is a furry, he does not seem to stand in our way at all. I think he should be unbanned.
[01:29] <SpexBluefox> *I was Soki.
[01:29] <weev> you were banned because you were deleting legitimate content.
[01:29] <Ego_Trip> An article should still be made about him, however.
[01:29] <A_RAPE_STENOGRAPHER> SpexBluefox: you were banned for faggotry
[01:29] <emoskank> deltro: at least 100
[01:29] <deltro> Ego_Trip is a closet furry.
[01:30] <deltro> The act of being a furry means you stand in our way.
[01:30] <SpexBluefox> fair enough, but content I will admit I foolishly deleted  thinking it wasn't legit.
[01:30] <ZombieG> protip: read ED next time pls.
[01:30] <inDeme> YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUST
[01:30] <JailBait> Too legit to quit
[01:30] <weev> SpexBluefox: do you have jpegs of your fursuit?
[01:30] <A_RAPE_STENOGRAPHER> SpexBluefox: we have this thing where people who have never been on our site before tell us what to do with it
[01:30] <SpexBluefox> I apologize for my actions, and only wish for ED to be kept the kick ass place that it is, and to be a part of it.
[01:30] <inDeme> truth* =[
[01:31] <inDeme> Kiss ass. :X
[01:31] <JailBait> Ahaha
[01:31] * Pastorize has quit IRC (Ping timeout�)
[01:32] <dsdaf> ~*~FuRRiES!@!1~*~
[01:32] <inDeme> What be the ruling on this ho?
[01:32] <Blargh> is this your number, spex: 978-744-8073
[01:32] <SpexBluefox> If you want to make an article on me, well feel free to do it. I honestly think it would be funny as hell to see. Granted posting info like what was shown on Soki's I wouldn't be happy about, but I can't really care that much now.
[01:32] <weev> okay
[01:32] <weev> SpexBluefox: you seem sincere enough
[01:32] <weev> so
[01:32] <weev> i'm going to motion that you be allowed to edit again
[01:32] <weev> i can always ban you 
[01:33] <weev> again
[01:33] <weev> but
[01:33] <weev> i want to see jpegs of you and your fursuit
[01:33] <weev> on your userpage
[01:33] <SpexBluefox> well that'd be great but I don't have a suit.
[01:33] <ZombieG> maek one

[01:33] <weev> i have a giant weevil costume
[01:33] <weev> with fawn horns
[01:33] <inDeme> What self respecting fur doesn't have a fursuit?
[01:33] <weev> to symbolize my malevolence
[01:33] <ZombieG> he means it hasn't come in the mail yet.
[01:33] <JailBait> ALART: BLANKING IN PROGRESS
[01:33] <SpexBluefox> The kind that doesn't have the means to get a suit yet

[01:51] <weev> A_RAPE_STENOGRAPHER: is he getting unbanned?
[01:51] <weev> im pretty much retracting my motion to unban
[01:51] <weev> since you didnt know jews did wtc
[01:51] <JailBait> Everyone has to start somewhere
[01:51] <SpexBluefox> weev>	okay

[01:52] <weev> yeah
[01:52] <weev> that was before

[01:52] <JailBait> I say let him stay, if he turns out to be unfunny, then we can just ban
[01:52] <JailBait> Lol
[01:52] <SpexBluefox> I don't sypathize with any religion
[01:52] <Ego_Trip> wait he didn't know jews did WTC?
[01:52] <weev> SpexBluefox: why are you an apologist for fascists?
[01:52] <weev> Ego_Trip: yeah dude
[01:52] <Ego_Trip> How do you not know that? It's so obvious.
[01:52] <weev> willful ignorance
[01:52] <weev> he knew
[01:52] <Ego_Trip> you are educated stupid if you don't believe that
[01:52] <weev> but he has a menorah recording his monitor output and keystrokes
[01:52] <ZombieG> dude, there's video documented proof on ED.
[01:53] <weev> and he couldnt risk his jew masters seeing him turn against them
[01:53] <SpexBluefox> hey, to be clear here
[01:53] <Ego_Trip> That's so like jew masters.
[01:53] <SpexBluefox> I never said the jews DIDN'T do 9/11
[01:53] <weev> okay
[01:53] <Ego_Trip> You implied they didn't by blaming another party.
[01:53] <weev> SpexBluefox: make a video for youtube
[01:53] <weev> saying authoritatively 
[01:53] <weev> that you believe jews to be solely responsible
[01:53] <weev> for the 9/11 attacks
[01:54] <ZombieG> �10SpexBluefox:�01 jews DIDN'T do 9/11
[01:54] <weev> and make sure to say it isnt satire
[01:54] <Ego_Trip> I support the motion for this video.
[01:54] <weev> if you do
[01:54] <weev> ill allow you to edit again
[01:54] <weev> i have to know that you aren't serving the jew
