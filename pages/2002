'''Daniel Keenan Savage''' is a [[homosexuality|homo]] who has a [[old media|newspaper]] column titled ''Savage Love'' which first appeared in a free [[Seattle]] based weekly called "The Stranger." His column has been running for [[at least 100 years ago|many years]] now, and deals with [[sextips|sex tips]] and [[love|relationship]] advice. He is also responsible for the [[old meme]] about Senator [[Rick Santorum]]'s name doubling for the result of having sex [[in the ass]]. He also coined the term "[[pegging]]" in order to make even [[heterosexual|heterosexuality]] gay. He spent [[over 9000|thousands]] of dollars on a [[baby]] boy for he and his gay lover to raise in a [[rape|loving]] household. In his column, he likes to make [[lulz|fun]] of lots of [[discrimination|different people]], including [[furry|furries]], [[bestiality|dogfuckers]], and [[crap|poo-eaters]]. He is not a member of [[NAMBLA]], though he is queerer than a [[dildo]]-shaped [[douche]].

Furthermore, while he never admits to it in public, he once gave a [[blumpkin]] to [[Michael Moore]] for [[Internet money|E$50]]. To this day, Moore has not paid up.

Like many pampered, overeducated post-modernist intellectuals, Dan Savage attempts to demystify sex through rationality and cynicism.  This makes his bloodless columns popular with insecure, gullible urbanites who think they can save themselves from the inconvenience of existential suffering by micro-managing their sexual relationships and dismissing their violent, soul-shaking urges as remnants of an irrelevant but still-present evolutionary hard-wiring.   The type of people who read Savage's columns are usually incapable of love and so wrapped up in themselves that sex with them is no more than a tedious evacuation-fuck.  Savage has made himself rich by exploiting the common delusion that with reason we can rise above human nature and reduce sex to mere sensation.  Plus, he's a fag.

==It gets better project==
Sometime [[last thursday]] Dan Savage teamed up with his butt buddy Terry and decided to start an international campaign of hate towards young white Christian Conservative children. Stereotyping them as all being bigoted homophobic bullies in hopes they will feel unwanted and commit suicide, all while completely ignoring the fact most homophobic flaming and bullying comes from black children out of single parent households that usually support the [[liberal|democratic party]]. The response has gathered some of the [[retard|biggest stars in Hollywood]] and [[over9000]] of the most ignorant self centered [[leftard|Youtubers]] on the web. All urging everyone to love and make peace with each other, that is, if they all agree with you politically. If not, feel free to treat them like total Horseshit! These responses are nothing more then the typical one way jargon to pour from a [[liberal]]'s mouth. The result of all this is liberal gay people feeling even more insecure about themselvs, because now they feel special only because of who they agree with, and the occasional [[aspergers|bisexual libertarian]] to now feel not only hated by [[Republican|Conservatards]] but by most other gays as well because they are supposed to agree with them politically in order to be considered a human being in their standards. 

==TL;DR==
Savage is a god tier gayfag troll.
