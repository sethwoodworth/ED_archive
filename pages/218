Adam
'''Adam''' is the most notorius Troll on [[Tribe.net]], a social networking site dominated by those with an interest in Burning Man.

Often screaming that individuals within the [[Burning Man]] tribe need to do exactly what he says, which is that it needs to change to his ideology.  Often using words like "consensus training", he will do whatever it takes to make [[Burning Man]] a complete failure.  His daily posts on the burning man tribe are often attacks against the individuals who produce the event, as well as those who attend it.

Master of the copy-paste, '''Adam''' loves to hijack threads by pasting copy and pasting partial comments from others completely out of context, to support his own trollish agenda.  But '''Adam''' doesn't stop there.  He often trolls on various other tribes, often claiming that women who get raped are usually asking for it, or that anyone who complains about a system (other than himself of course) is just some complaining hippy who won't shut up.

'''Adam''' has also claimed that he had a brief job once back in the 1990's at an internet start up in San Francisco, but after a few months was laid off and received a severance package.  He has somehow managed to stretch this small trust fund over almost a decade, and traveled the world, living in style in many different countries, never having to hold down a job again.

His response to his hatred of [[Burning Man]] has been to start up his own event and permanent living community, called '''the Floating Man project'''.  '''Floating Man''' was to purchase an Island in Nicaragua were artists could live and make art.  After gaining less than 2 other individuals interested in the project, the project has all but failed.  Many he who have had this project forced down their throat have claimed that they would have no interest living with '''Adam''' on a deserted Island, even if rape is socially acceptable, or if the Island does lay in the path of an active volcano.
