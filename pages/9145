[[File:Nig_ger.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A game you will never see]]

Once every four years, [[9000|billions]] of peasants, workers, bosses, politicians and [[King]]s and [[Queen]]s around the world (except [[America]]) [[quit|down tools]], turn on their [[TV]]s and [[radio]]s and give their undivided [[attention]] to a glorious carnival of [[lulz]] and [[drama]] known as the '''World Cup''' - an unparalleled  celebration of the world's most popular sport, [[football]].

==History==
The game of [[football]] was invented in [[England]] at least [[100 years ago]] before the [[Romans]] invaded, when the savages of [[England|Eng]] would [[pwn]] their fellow [[cunt]]rymen, (the even moar filthy, dirty savage [[Scotland|Celts]] and [[Dragons|Welsh]]), in battle, cut off their heads and then kick them around the countryside. It pretty much stayed that way until [[WW2]], when Britfags got their shit together to fight [[Hitler|a common enemy]]. After that, shit got organised and 'civilised' leaving it up to [[Chavs|lazy, violent, unemployed]] disaffected youth to keep the tradition alive by kicking heads around whilst still attached to the body with steel-toe [[Doc Martens]].

By 1929, everyone in the world was playing football thanks to its spread courtesy of marauding [[empire]] builders like the [[English]], [[Spanish]], [[French]], [[Portuguese]], [[Dutch]] and [[Germans]] (along with the slightly more interesting imports like [[VD]] and [[Christianity|God]]). It was around this time that [[Jews|someone]] figured out there was [[Jew Gold|money]] to be made from organising a global tournament of the '''[[boring|Beautiful Game]]''' once every four years and -behold- the '''World Cup''' was born and the first World Cup was played in 1930.

==[[South Africa]]: [[2010]]==
The first World Cup to be played on [[African]] [[Shit|soil]] took place in June 2010 and started off as [[lulzy]] and [[dramatic]] as one would expect from such [[GRIDS|a disaster]] of a continent when SA's [[an Tyrant|president for life]] and [[apartheid]] hero [[Nelson Mandela]] let his great-granddaughter go to a [[U2]] concert at the opening event and [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2010/06/world-cup-mandela-to-miss-opener-after-fatal-accident.html she died in a car crash]. After that, Mr Mandela was [[BAW|notably absent]] from the opening game: [[Niggers|South Africa]] v. [[Spics|Mexico]]. 

Drama and lulz having been established, the 2010 World Cup then turned its focus on producing [[original content]] Internets and IRL [[meme]] after [[meme]]. From the jump, the world was exposed to South Africa's best kept secret (and one everyone wishes would have stayed a secret), the [[Vuvuzela]]. This [[WMD|weapon of temper and ear destruction]] has become the only [[unforced meme]] in history of the Internets to be [[haters gonna hate|reviled and dissed]] and wished into [[old meme|oblivion]] by everyone from the players on the field to the [[channers]] on the [[chans]].

Lost on almost everyone (except [[ED]]) was the delicious [[irony]] that Africa was being re-invaded by all their former [[whitey|colonial masters]] to re-pwn the inferior footie played in [[Nigeria|Niggeria]].

==The Tournament==

===Group Play===
[[File:4chan_sports2.png|thumb|center|900px|[[4chan]]'s /[[sp]]/ customised for the World Cup and reflecting US [[butthurt]] over a [[orly|bad call]] for the US]]
The competition starts with [[gangbang|'''Group Play''']] in which the 32 teams that qualified for the World Cup are divided into 8 groups -A thru H. Each group has 4 teams that play in a [[Polandball|round robbin]] fashion, the top 2 teams advancing to the next round. These matches take two weeks to separate the [[WIN|wheat]] from the [[FAIL|chaff]]...plenty of time for naturally occurring memes like [[The Hand of Clod]] and [[The Penguin]] to form. 

Also [[meme]]worthy was [[France]] who -to nobody's surprise- surrendered and went home. They had already tried to surrender in the qualification game against [[Ireland]], but in true [[FAIL|''luck of the Irish'']] fashion, when the French threw up their hands to surrender, a stray ball hit Thierry Henry's hand and went in the goal to eliminate the Potatoniggers. 

<center><youtube>Vs8WWBXGiXg</youtube></center>

Stunned that they were back in the World Cup only 4 years after getting pwnt by the Italian [[acting|National Diving Team]] in the [[Zinedine|2006 World Cup final]], they set about fagging up Group Play by having [[lolcow]] hissy-fits amongst themselves and [[drama|acting out]] worse than the Italians -who also decided to go home early after finding out that [[diving]] was no longer a World Cup sport.

<center>'''To [[noone]]'s surprise, France surrenders'''.</center>

<center><youtube>7pRzbGeeAiU</youtube></center>
<br>
To make matters worse, France exited the 2010 World Cup only 4 years after surrendering to the Italians in the [[2006]] final when they surrendered to the [[South Africa|host nation's team]] that only got into the World Cup by being [[niggers|the host nation]]. Having thrown their hands up so many times already, they had no hands left to throw up to show good sportsmanship as they [[GTFO|went home]] -[[karma|much to the delight]] of [[User:Wit|the Micks]].

===Stage 2===
[[File:Brackets 2010-06-26.png|thumb|300px|The part where [[Murkins]] can understand it]]
[[File:Ghana_sticky.png|thumb|300px|The only time in [[4chan]] history where Anon rooted for [[niggers]]]]
'''Stage 2''' is more conventional win-or-go-home [[gline|elimination]] matchplay with brackets that your typical [[Murkin]] can get his or her peabrain around. Unlike Group Play, there are no boring 0-0 [[boring|ties]] on this level and if the game is tied at the end of regulation, the games go to dramarific [[ice hockey|extra time and/or sudden death penalty shootouts]]. Usually, [[nobody cares|Americans stop caring]] by this stage since they fail at life and never make it beyond Group Play, however, the US team advanced in [[2010]] by playing the [[victim complex]] card and [[419|responding to an urgent business proposal]] to win their group (thanks to a [[softgoal]] against their [[England|elders and betters]] who felt that letting the US win [[troll's remorse|would make up]] for [[BP]]'s epic [[Deepwater Horizon]] troll in the Gulf of Mexico and placate the angry mobs of [[New Orleans|Ragin' Cajuns]] who were crashing BP stock). Thus, [[ESPN]] are guaranteed moar [[Jew Golds]] and Americans are treated to the wonders of [[free|advertising-free]] games that actually last what it says on the clock: 90 minutes (+3).
 
2010's [[mantrain|Group Play]] ended with every African team barring [[Ghana]] being [[holocaust|eliminated]], leaving the locals just one team to root for. And yet, those fucking [[Vuvuzelas]] just won't [[STFU]]. Luckily, Ghana had a rematch with their [[pwn]]ees from the last World Cup -USA- and was guaranteed a win and a berth in the next round since its opponent in Stage 2 are American college educated [[sissies]]. You see, only in America do young men learn the Beautiful Game on lush pitches on college campuses via 'soccer' scholarships. The rest of the world learns the game and gets mad skillz as [[poor|working class]] young [[chavs|guttersnipes]] on the mean streets and gravel pitches of big cities.

Apart from that, Stage 2 is dominated by [[South America]]n teams -as per usual. Really, the rest of the world should just give up because [[Brazil]] or [[Argentina]] win the World Cup every time. And the [[European]] teams that ''do'' make it thru to Stage 2 are usually the [[wops]] and [[dagos]] who [[raid|colonised]] South America in the first place so if you're [[Caucasian]] and rooting for [[Germany]] or [[England]] (aka the [[Chicago Cubs]] of footie)...abandon hope all ye who enter here [[naow]]. Why the inequity? Well, the general equation is: impoverished, unstable nation + mass [[unemployment]] + losers + crime = [[1337]]ness and [[WIN]]. If America was really serious about winning a World Cup, they'd stop black high school kids from playing [[basketball]] and make them play "soccer".

Look for odds-on favourites [[Spain]] and a handsome [[Portuguese]] squad to at least make it interesting, but it's pretty much a foregone conclusion that Brazil will play Argentina in the final.

===Uruguay v South Korea===
[[vuvuzela|BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ]]

'''Uruguay 2, [[Good Korea]] 1'''. Predictably, the dog eaters' goalie's [[azn|slanty eyes]] couldn't see two balls heading toward the net.

===Portugal vs North Korea===
[[Image:NORTH KOREAN PLAYER.jpg|thumb|200px|North Korean player in a show of [[faggotry|manly tears]] after being raped by Portugal's [[Gangbang|entire soccer team]].]]

On June 21, 2010, [[Portugal]] had [[pwnt]] North Korea 7:0 in their World Cup match, thus [[banned|permabanning]] them from the competition.
The humiliation had caused great [[Butthurt|butthurt]] for Kim Jong Il, who declared [[Jihad]] upon Portugal, and issued an order to behead all the North Korean [[n00b]] players who made them [[Luser|the laughing stock of soccer fans worldwide]]. Mr. Il is still deciding whether to release the friends and families of the team from detention camps where they were stashed to prevent the cowardly dog-eating losers from defecting to South Efrika.

===Ghana vs USA===
On Saturday June 26th, 14:00 Pacific Daylight Time, [[losers|Team USA]] were pronounced dead after an extra-time '''2-1''' defeat at the feet of an impoverished bunch of [[niggers]] from a country the size of [[Rhode Island]] following a [[boring|spirited competition]]...[[2006|again]]. America's only goal was from an uncontested but dubious penalty call and the conversion from the penalty spot. They leave behind [[nobody cares|America's collective care]] for football, [[Vuvuzelas|their ability to hear anything]] and the 2010 World Cup. [[And nothing of value was lost]]. Oh well, the [[Yankees]] are playing the [[LA|Doyers]] in a couple of hours.

===England vs Germany===
[[File:The_sun_world_cup.jpg|thumb|200px|The Sun shows unusual restraint]]
''See main article at: [[The Great Buttrape of Bloemfontein]]''

'''Germany 4, England 1'''. Predictably, the [[Chicago Cubs]] turned up in place of England to play and lose this [[WW2|grudge match]] with the Krauts. This might sound bad for Britfags but -honestly- the English wouldn't know what to do if England actually won at a game they invented. Since English fans take these [[SFB|matters very srsly]], the ref has been placed in the witless relocation programme and is under 24/7 police protection. The following day, FIFA boss, Sepp Blatter issued an apology and promised to think about goal-line reviews in the future, obviously in fear of his life.

===Argentina vs. Mexico===
'''Argentina 3, Mexico 1''' Any TV sets that were still [[Beaners|tuned into]] the 2010 World Cup got turned off after North America's ''real'' football team, [[Mexico]], were [[owned]] by [[Argentina]] during their 90 minute [[siesta]]. Predictably, there was another bad call on an offside Argentinian goal but since Mexicans are always asleep on the job, nobody could be bothered to bitch about it.

===Holland vs. Slovakia===
[[vuvuzela|BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ]]
[[File:Japan_world_cup.jpg|thumb|200px|Essentially, /[[sp]]/ [[Rule 34]] of Team Japan]]

'''[[Holland|Dutchland]] 2, Slovakia 1''' With Germany, Europistan's hopes still remain alive thanks to the clog-wearing [[glory hole|dyke fingerers]] advancing to the quarter-finals by boring Slovakia to death.
===Brazil vs. Chile===
'''Brazil 3, Chile 0''' Not three months after a magnitude 7.5 [[earthquake]] destroyed most of Chile, Brazil continued to rock the Chileans socks off. Already drained from the quake and its fallout, Chile failed to produce and [[lulz]] or [[drama]] as well as goals.

===Paraguay vs. Japan===
[[boring|ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ]]
[[File:Blue_samurai_penor.jpg|200px|thumb|Why Japan lost]]
'''Paraguay 5, Japan 3'''. This [[boring|snoozefest]] livened up after being tied 0:0 even after extra time (that's [[tl;dw|2 fucking hours]] if you're counting along at home) when it went to the penalty shootout where each side gets 5 attempts. After being tied 2:2 a Jap [[loser|defender]] hit the bar and gave Paraguay the 3:2 edge. Paraguay went on to convert all of theirs [[ftw|for the win]]. As Japanese [[pokemon|tradition]] dictates, the Nip who fucked up then committed [[self-pwn|Seppuku]] in the middle of the pitch.

===Spain vs. Portugal===
'''Spain 1, Portugal 0''': Spain [[Rape|raeps]] Portugal once again. Even the Portagee weren't surprised and accepted their loss like true [[fag|fags]] preferring to throw elbows by way of attacking Spain instead of lobbing balls into the Spanish net. Portugal's superstar captain/hunk, Christian Ronaldo, was too busy being a [[faggot|male model]] to play football.

==Quarter Finals==
[[File:Red card.png|thumb|LOL [[b&]]!]]

===Dutchland vs. Brazil===
{{main|Robbenball}}
'''Dutchland 2, Brazil 1''': In one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history, the #1 ranked team in the world (and favourites to win it all) Brazil dominated the first half and made the Hollish look like the bonnet and clog wearing sissies they are, swarming the Hollish goal and getting an early score. And pretty boy Kaka would have scored a second if it wasn't for the Dutch goalie using obvious hax. They went into half-time up 1:0 however, being the [[cosplay]]ing trannies Brazilians are, they changed strips with their opponents and played like Dutch [[wimmins]] in the second half, giving up a [[Robert Green|pwn goal]], throwing [[butthurt|hissy fits]] over Dutchland's impersonation of the [[acting|Italian]] team's traditional diving/acting routine and generating drama resulting in several yellow cards and a [[permaban|red]] (which meant they had to play with only 10 'men') from the ref. The Hollish prevailed and [[Vegas]] bookies [[shit bricks]].

===Uruguay vs. Ghana===
{{main|Team Uruguay}}
'''Uruguay 4, Ghana 2''': Uruguay pwns on penalties. Another [[boring|extra-time game thriller]] ended in a 1:1 tie after Ghana had a chance to win on a penalty in the final minute following a flagrant [[hero|handball]] by Uruguay on the goal line. Ghana had spent the extra period swarming the Uruguay goal but had failed to score. They failed again in what should have been a guaranteed ticket to the semi-finals when the penalty kick hit the crossbar. The penalty shootout was prolly the lulziest and most dramatic football in the World Cup thus far and included two saves from the Uruguay goalie and a penalty from Uruguay that resembled a PAT in [[handegg]]. The clincher was a pure troll chip shot goal from the Uruguay sub.
 
With this defeat, Africa's last hope in the World Cup exited in shame and the [[Vuvuzela]]s went momentarily silent for the first time in three weeks.

[[File:Paul picks germany.jpg|thumb|/[[sp]]/'s octopus [[Paul]] correctly picks Germany [[ftw]].]]

===Germany vs. Argentina===
'''Germany 4, Argentina 0''': Germany's well-oiled football hate machine stormed through Argentina's defense like Panzers rolling through [[Poland]] and the [[Germans]] [[holocaust]]ed [[Argentina]] easily. Striking early with a goal in the opening minutes of the first half and applying constant pressure on the Argentinian goal area prevented [[Diego Maradona]]'s team from executing their gameplan of [[lazy|winging it]]. At halftime in Argentina's locker room it was decided that Argentina would [[quit|surrender]] unconditionally -including all diving, acting and badgering the ref. This, of course, ruined any chance of [[lulz]], [[drama]] and [[memes]] (other than Germanfags on /[[sp]]/ spamming up the board with [[U MAD]] shoops). The German victory also gave Britfag /[[sp]]/astics momentary [[USI|redemption]] from their own failure against the Blitz, allowing them to claim [[WIN|superiority]] over Argentina since they actually scored against Germany.

===Spain vs. Paraguay===
'''Spain 1, Paraguay 0''': With Argentina and co-favourites Brazil out, it was left up to Paraguay to join [[Team Uruguay|Uruguay]] in keeping the Americas' World Cup hopes alive against a heavily favoured Spanish team.  Playing without their star striker who [http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=9864652 was shot in the head in February] the s[[crappy]] Paraguayans held off their relentless former colonial masters for much of the game by repeating the formula: dive + complain = free kick whenever Spain got near their goal. An otherwise [[tl;dw]] game was salvaged late in the second half by [[drama|back-to-back penalty calls]] for [[Clusterfuck|each team within the space of two minutes.]] Additional lulz and drama came when the Spanish goalie saved Paraguay's attempt and Spain's successful kick was [[trolling IRL|disallowed by the ref]] for [[LOL WUT|encroachment]] and saved after it was retaken. Massive global butthurt over all the bad calls throughout the tournament was avoided when Spain's David Villa managed to scrape out a 'real' goal just before the final whistle.

==Semi-Finals==
[[File:Told_you.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paul]]: Germany's [[final boss]]]]
[[File:Germany_spain.png|thumb|200px|[[manly tears|DELICIOUS GERMAN TEARS]]]]

===Dutchland vs. Uruguay===
'''Holland 3, [[Unfunny|Ur-a-gay]] 2''': With [[The Hand of Dios|the almighty Suarez]] gone, there was virtually no hope left for South America. After 18 minutes, [[Italian|Giovanni]] [[wat|van Bronckhorst]] made a goal with so much hax (on his dad's birthday, manly tears were shed.), the referees had to check if he didn't have auto-aim on. But a while later, captain Forlan made the 1-1 with so much ease that it seemed as if the goalkeeper in yellow had turned [[Hand of Clod|green]]. In the second half, the Dutchies actually did something and finished off the [[racist|Mexicans]]. [[TL;DR]]: piece of goddamn shit, just like every other Dutchie game.

===Spain vs Germany===
[[Spain]] was predicted to win according to [[Paul the Psychic Octopus]], so [[Germany]] should have just [[Downfall|surrendered like Hitler]] and blown their brains out and lick the generalissimo's balls. And behold, Paul was right. '''Spain 1, Germany 0'''. Paul got into the Germans' heads and then took over the head of Spain's [[Paul|Puyol]] making it head the ball into the [[German]] net late in the second half. Spain pretty much dominated the game throughout, swarming the German goal in wave after wave of attacking Spaniards. Germany's well-oiled scoring machine [[Fail|fell apart]] like the Nazi's under advancing Russian troops at the end of [[WW2]]. Delicious German tears were shed... and they weren't the [[manly tears|manly kind]].

Paul was then attacked by [[butthurt]] Germanfags all over [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Paul-The-Psychic-Octopus/119035754807982 his Failbook page] with threats to turn him into [[calamari]].

==[[SNCA|Third Place Game]]==
[[File:Paul_owns_uruguay.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Paul|PAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUULLLLLLLLL!]]]]

===Germany vs. Uruguay===
[[Nobody cares]]. However, [[Paul the Psychic Octopus]] predicted that [[Germany]] would win, so with his [[perfect]] record of prognostication on the line, this match of [[losers]] became slightly more interesting. In addition, with Uruguayan and [[ED]] hero, [[Luis Suarez]] back off suspension for his [[Hand of Dios]] shenanigans, ''some'' [[lulz]] and [[drama]] were in play. In fact, every time he touched the ball, he was relentlessly [[butthurt|booed]] by the packed stadium, managing to completely drown out those fucking [[Vuvuzelas]].

In what turned out to be one of the most exciting games of the 2010 World Cup, Paul went on to beat [[Uruguay]] despite the fact that Uruguay looked like they owned for much of the match. '''Germany 3, Uruguay 2'''. Everyone [[shit bricks]], including [[Mani the Psychic Parakeet]] when Forlan had a free-kick just outside the penalty box as the clock wound down and rocketed it in... [[Nice try|in to the crossbar]]. 

[[TL;DR]]? Paul über alles.

[[Spain|TROOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLL!]]

A [[boring|close match]] went into extra-time after being tied 0:0 at the end of regulation and given that the Dutch seemed hellbent on proving Paul wrong by attempting to [[cripple]] every Spanish player to win, people began to have their doubts. Never bet against Paul though. With a [[perfect]] record on the line, [[Paul the Psychic Octopus]] psychically took over Spain's [[hero|Andrés Iniesta]]'s brain and gave him the power to score the game winner as the clock ran out. 

The [[Hollish]] subsequently abandoned their gameplan of kicking everything that moved (except the ball) and started crying to the ref [[Howard Webb]] ([[Trollface]] incarnate) that the Spaniard was offsides but the replay clearly showed that the goal was legit. [[Cry moar]] faggots. Holland did, however, win at collecting a record 9 yellow cards and a [[gline|red]] after committing 28 fouls. Spain finished second with 5 yellows but since one of them was issued when Iniesta [[gay|took his shirt off after scoring]], it was only 4 legit ones.

{{tinyquote|Sunday's World Cup final was supposed to be a display of the subtlety and grace of "[[faggotry|beautiful football]]." Instead, the Dutch [[ruin|destroyed it]], displaying all the subtlety and grace of a street fight by earning nine yellow cards and a red card, a record for a World Cup final.|[http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-championship-20100712,0,3557498.story LA Times]}}

Naturally, [[Paul]] was right...AGAIN!!! '''Spain 1, Dutchland 0'''. 8 for 8...one for each [[tentacle|eighttacle]]. 100% accuracy! Fuck you [[mani|parakeet]] who thought Holland would win. Paul finished the World Cup 8 for 8, (a win for each [[tentacle]]) the chances of which is [[EPIC|1/256]]

The post-game festivities included [[Al Qaeda]] following through [http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20001940-503543.html with their promise to blow up the World Cup] by [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/top/all/7103884.html blowing up a crowd] watching the match in Kampala, [[Uganda]].
