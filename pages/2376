Dr. Date Rape
{{potential}}<br>

[[Image:Drdaterape01.jpeg|thumb|right| Jeffrey Marsalis, a true romantic for the 21st century.]]
In late 2008, a [[baw]]wing [[feminist]] [[article]] brought to light the [[lulz|brave actions]] of one [[Wop|Jeffrey Marsalis]] - AKA '''Dr. [[Date Rape]]''' - who is neither a doctor nor going on very many dates these days. Before he was [[V&]] then [[IRL B&]], "Dr. Date Rape" managed to [[rape|woo]] [[at least 100|hundreds]] of women using a strategy based on brilliant [[logic]]:

# All women are [[whores]]
# All whores crave [[money]]
# Therefore, [[Logic|all women must like doctors because doctors have money]]. 

To exactly [[noone]]'s surprise (except the women, LOL) this worked flawlessly.

== I was Raped On a Date Stories ==

Sheryl, a student, once had a narrow escape with a rape. “I had a very good friend of mine, with whom I used to hang out all the time. We used to occasionally go to his farmhouse an hour away from the city, and have a drink or two. One day, when we were at the farm, he asked me to kiss him. I burst out laughing and told him to shut up. He pestered me for a long time, and finally I told him that I would kiss him just once, and we would forget all about it. I gave him a peck on his lips and then backed away. But he just grabbed me and began running his hands all over my body..."

== Let's Learn From The Master ==

[[Fight Club|The first thing you need to understand]] about Marsalis is that he was a good-looking guy. [[Not gay|I mean, this dude was handsome]]. As the prosecution stated, "''Look at this adonis of a man. He's [[hawt]]. Any woman in her right mind would want to skewer herself on his dick. [[I'd hit it|Hell, I want to fuck him in my ass right now]]. There's no way this guy couldn't get some willingly, from a woman if he wanted to."'' Marsalis, unlike [[you]], was not an [[ugly]] [[troll]] and thus did [[lie|not "need to rape"]] to get some. That he was capable of raping so many women due in part to his good looks and charm [[Nerd rage|is a testament to the shallowness of women everywhere]]. 

=== Moving On... ===

Dr. Date Rape is living [[fact|proof]] that all women are [[asking for it]]. In point of fact, many of his dates literally asked for it, repeatedly. [[Extreme advertising|But don't take our word for it!]] Their actions speak louder than their accusations:

|I made the stupidest decision to go out with him that second time!|[[Yes]]. Yes she did.
|One 33-year-old woman testified that, after regaining consciousness in Marsalis’s apartment, she discovered his bed was soaked with [[Cracky-chan|her]] [[Period|menstrual]] [[blood]], humiliating her; she later [[Powerbook|FedExed]] Marsalis a set of sheets.|Some filthy skank, proving once again that women remaining in the [[kitchen]] is best for everyone.
|Two of his accusers [[Facebook|befriended]] him. ''Two others went on to briefly date Marsalis.''|Facebook slut... it just keeps going on like this.
|A 26-year-old pharmaceutical representative told the court that the assault left her pregnant — and she allowed Marsalis, of all people, to accompany her to the [[abortion]].|Match.com's "[[Pro-choice]] in Seattle" -- [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|oh wow.]]

== Getting Away With It ==

Like [[kittens]] 99% of all good stories involving sexual assault and [[sick fuck]]ery these days, the [[internets]] was probably [[lurk]]ing somewhere behind a dumpster, refusing interviews from the [[media]] about its [[obvious|alleged]] involvement. 

The [[facts]] speak for themselves: Marsalis used [[Online dating|Match.com]] to meet most of his [[Gullible|marks]]. Later, this fact would be used against the [[victims]] in [[Internet law|a court of lawl]] to assert that anybody who uses online dating services is pretty much saying, "[[Nirvana|rape me]]." In this way, Marsalis was brought to court several times, and [[LOL|let free to rape and rape again.]]

== The [[Irony]] ==

This section was going to point out the irony of the [[fact]] that after he had raped hundreds of women, Marsalis is now in [[prison]], being pounded [[in the ass]] by some huge hairy black person with [[shit]]ty prison yard tattoos all over his [[cock|weiner]]. You know, sort of like in [[Shit nobody cares about|that Sublime song about date rape]]. However, as it turns out, the state of [[Pennsylvania]] where Dr. Date Rape was put on trial [[LOL WUT|did not convict him of a single count of rape]], despite the jury being treated to a parade of dozens of witness-[[cum]]-victims. This is because it was clear to the [[sick fucks|good folks]] of [[Pennsylvania]] that his "victims" obviously had it coming, and, in point of fact, liked it (at least while they were conscious, [[LOL]]). Marsalis was put in minimum security jail for [[like]] 2 years max for some [[pussy]]-ass [[Fail|cop-out "sexual assault" charge]]. This is not nearly as much time as he would have received for being found guilty of rape - [[Shit nobody cares about|which he was, in fact, guilty of]]. 

In conclusion: [[Patriot|God bless America]], and [[freedom]] for all [[hypocrite|unless you're <s>a woman</s>]] a moron who continues to see your date rapist because you're happy you snagged a moderately attractive doctor.
