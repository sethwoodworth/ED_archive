'''''Rogue''''' is a computer game created in the [[80s]] when there was no [[Windows]] and [[dinosaurs]] roamed the earth.
==Gameplay==
You play as [[an hero|a hero]] trying to get through a dungeon looking for Jew, finding items and questionable potions while leveling up. You could call it the [[Your mom|mother]] of all dungeon crawlers.

For all you [[13-year-old boy]]s out there it's pretty much like ''[[Diablo II]]'' or ''[[EverQuest]]'' but with more pretty graphics and less multiplayer.

You cannot call yourself a true [[geek]] if you haven't played it and beat it. Or been [[masturbate|beating off]] while playing it.
