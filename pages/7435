{{quote|Shaun Ellis has nothing to teach a wolf. He cannot teach them how to hunt, he cannot teach them how to have sex, and he cannot teach them how to seriously fight among themselves. Think about it. Ellis is too slow to chase down a rabbit. More to the point, the wolves do not have near enough room to run down a deer or elk on their own (not that there are any elk in the U.K.). So what does Ellis "teach" the wolves to do instead? He teaches them to ... wait for it ... fish with a few mackeral and trout he steals from the seal exhibit next door. Oh goodie! Talk about Through the Looking Glass. |[http://terriermandotcom.blogspot.com/2007/04/national-geographics-stunt-television.html Terrierman]}}
Once in a while a [[furry]] will strike gold and live the life he has always dreamed of living. '''Shaun Ellis''' (a.k.a. the ''Wolfman'') doesn't have a [[fursuit]], doesn't spend all his money on comissions on [[FurAffinity]] and has never been to a [[Furmeet]] {{citation}}. Instead he has given up the the delusional wannabe world of [[OL]] furfaggotry and moved on to [[IRL]] furfaggotry by living with wolves.

==Background==
[[File:Shaun Ellis Wolf Books.PNG|thumb|350px|There appears to be a pattern among his customers ...]]

Universally believed to be the ultimate [[wolfaboo]], Shaun lives in [[Britain]] ([[facepalm|where wolves have been extinct since the 1700s]]) and has been literally living with wolves for between 12-15 years, stopping only occassionally to put on clothes, sleep inside a house, cook his food, and use the toilet like all wild animals do. He does not bathe, as his wolves would consider this "unnatural." Like all furries, Shaun originally worked with [[foxes]] before deciding [[wolves]] were more [[awesome]]. Specifically, like all wolfaboos, he only likes the fluffy [[USA|North American]] wolf, as opposed to the short and scraggly [http://www.cosmosmith.com/arabian_wolves.html Arabian wolves], or the scrawny brown [http://www.cosmosmith.com/european_gray_wolves.asp European wolves] (which are more closely related to the now extinct British wolf populations than his zoo-bred North American wolves will ever be).

Also, like all wolfaboos, Shaun has proven he cares more about the latest animal in fashion than he does other people - particularly his own family. Shaun has several children from a previous relationship, after he realized that rolling in shit and eating raw meat with wild animals was preferable to taking care his brats. His wife has denied this allegation, however, and claims she divorced Shaun out of shame.

Shaun's ultimate goal is to re-introduce wolves to [[Britain]]. His plan sadly is destined to [[fail]] because:
#[[England]] is such an overcrowded and built-up country there is literally nowhere for wolves to live.
#The [[Welsh]] would not take kindly to wolves killing and eating their lovers.
#Although it just might be possible to re-introduce wolves to the wilds of [[Scotland]] they would most likely be shot, deep-fried and eaten by burly Scotsmen.

==="Unique Maverick Researcher"===
[[File:Benigntrollpic.jpg|thumb|Tanja Askani took these photographs. Shortly afterwards, bloody pawprints were found around the fawn's dead body. How they got there [[It is a mystery|is a mystery]].]]

Shaun's claim to fame is his unqiue experiment of living and eating alongside wolves in their natural environment (the zoo) instead of viewing them from afar, like most researchers. Unfortunately, he is not the only lunatic to give up health, hygiene and sanity to live with wolves:

*[[German]] photographer Tanja Askani lived with wolves for 8 years. Like Shaun she too thinks that [http://www.tanja-askani.de/info/?p=12 wolves are not the bloodthirsty hunters and we can all earn spiritual enlightenment by living with this great majestic creature].

*Filmaker Jim Dutcher lived with wolves for 6 years. Exactly the same as Askani and Ellis.

Notably, while both Askani and Dutcher lived among wild wolves, Shaun has only managed to live among semi-tame wolves living in cages.

==Other Work==
[[File:Wolf Management Wikipedia.PNG|left|thumb|After 15 years of living with wolves and writing five books about their language and behaviour, Shaun turns to [[Wikipedia]].]]

{{quote|Their language is quite simple. They have a baseline. Anything that is high in tone is encouraging; anything that’s low in tone is discouraging.|He managed to shit <s>four</s> five books out of that.}}

Shaun has written several books on wolves including ''[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Man-Who-Lives-Wolves/dp/0007327153/ref=pd_sim_b_1 The Man who Lives with Wolves]'', ''[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wolf-Within-How-learned-talk/dp/000732717X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1282873719&sr=8-5 The Wolf Within: How I Learned to Talk Dog]'' (on wolf "language"), ''[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wolf-Talk-Shaun-Ellis/dp/189905703X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1282873719&sr=8-1 Wolf Talk]'' (which is exactly the same) ''[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2548646.spirit_of_the_wolf Spirit of the Wolf Talk]'' (see previous) and finally ''Oral Bestiality Among Canines: How I learnt "Woof" means "Yes"''.

He also has his own site [http://www.wolfpack-management.com/ Wolfpack-management.com]. Interestingly, the [http://wolfpack-management.com/content/view/20/26/ pages dedicated to wolf behaviour] are all exact copies of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf article about wolves] from [[Wikipedia]], thus proving a shitty online [[Bureaucratic Fuck|bureaucracy]] run by [[homosexual]] [[asspies]] knows more about wolves than Shaun Ellis.
