Guess The Meme
'''Guess The Meme''' (or [[Netspeak|phrase]]) is a [[2007]] [[B|/b/]] [[meme]] -or rather, a game- that is playing to [[WIN|standing-room]] only crowds of [[B|/b/tards]] who only recently finished [[unfunny|fasting]] for the [[anti-lulz|holy month]] of [[Islam|Loladan]], hungry and thirsty for [[original content]].
==[[The Game]]==

Like the [[old school]] [http://www.geocities.com/shabber_1/rainier.html Rainier '''bottle cap'''] games, this 'meme' is played when [[OP]] (and subsequent [[post]]ers) posts an image collage or rebus that constitute clues for the [[peanut gallery]] to try and '''guess the meme'''. 

[[Image:Guess_the_meme-op.png|thumb|700px|center|[[OP]] posts. The [[peanut gallery]] respond.]]

[[Image:Garyfuckingoak.jpg|thumb|center|500px|The correct answer is -of course- [[Gary Fucking Oak|Gary MOTHERFUCKING Oak]].]]

==[[amirite|Easy Amirite]]?==

This is not quite as simple as it sounds, because [[posts]] will sometimes be [[trap|cunning stunts<!---lol spoonerism--->]] that don't  exactly 'spell-out' the meme or saying in question, but generally allude to the riddle's answer.


[[Image:Toasting_in_epic_bread.jpg|thumb|600px|center|This is a [[B|/b/tardisation]] of an [[old meme|traditional]] [[B|/b/]] [[cliche|catchphrase]] '''"[[posting in an epic thread]]"'''. The correct answer is "Toasting in an epic bread".]]

==[[Faggotry]]==
[[Image:Game-sheeps-fags-nigger.png|thumb|300px|[[I Came]]]]
Howevar, this [[game]] is at its most [[lulz|hilarious]] when the [[peanut gallery]] is not only [[derp|too stupid]] to guess the meme but posts some ridiculous bullshit answer anyway. Further [[lulz]] are to be had by not trying to play [[the game]] at all within the spirit of the thing, but 'guessing' the answers in a literal fashion. In this example, the picture of a '''ewe''', the cast of TV's '''[[Lost]]''' and the rapper '''The Game''' obviously depicts the meme ''''[[you lost the game]].'''' 

Of course, because it's [[B|/b/]], a [[retard|wag]] from the [[peanut gallery]] decides it will be [[lulz]]ier to post [[truth|literally]]. Thus, within the clues of the collage, [[Mr. Peanut]] sees it [[fact|as it is]] and responds with the infinitely moar lulzy '''"sheep"''', '''"fags"''' and '''"nigra".''' And whilst [[:Image:Bawwwww_bunny.jpg|some might respond]] with that hoary old /b/ comeback, "[[:Image:Nicethingscat.jpg|this is why we can't have nice things]]," the wag in question has actually '''won''' [[The Game]], since [[The Game]] 'meme' is part of [[the cancer that is killing /b/]]. 

So cheers to you [[Mr. Peanut]].

==[[You are doing it wrong]]==
Lulz can also be had when a poster gives away the answer in his post's image's caption. Here, one only need look at the poster's caption -'''RapThorGZeus copy.gif'''- to solve the riddle and [[flame]] OP for being a faggot.

==[[Troll]]ing For Memage==
Further lulz can be had when someone posts a completely [[random]] collage that means nothing at all.
