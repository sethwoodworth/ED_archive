Random Idiot
Random Idiot (also known as The Idiot) is a member of the two-faced, whiny [[self injury]] support group [[Bodies Under Siege]]. She lives up to her name.




==Usernames==

She is perhaps best known for changing her usernames in much a similar fashion as most people change their underwear (exception: [[Sine Nomine]]) An extensive list has been made, but many of the earlier names are lost to time.

*Forgotten Little Girl 
*nihilistic beauty
*Peppermint Patty
*Lost Idiot
*Nein Engel (hurriedly changed to "Kein Engel")
*Beau
*mistaken
*insipid
*Sirens
*Big Mama
*Hollow Tree
*DeviantGirl
*Pres de Vous
*Invisible Monster
*not_alone

==Hobbies== 

With every new username comes a new introduction on The Idiot's behalf, and we learn of her many hobbies, such as dying her hair, drinking anyone under the table, going to gigs, Evanescence, [[Japanese]] horror, [[Harry Potter]], posting embarassing pictures of herself, and LOADS more but she can't remember.

She also loves having passionate arguments with her skanky step-father/boyfriend, Steve.




==Catchphrases==

*nevermind lol
*anyhoo
*there's loads more but I can't remember
*hi I used to be --- but I changed my name to ---
*--- is such a [[skank]]
*I'm a [[twat]]
*bid my blood to run before i come undone
*omg omg omg
*I have the body of a god - [[buddha]]

==Fora==

The Idiot's absolute passion is to create support fora, often mirror images of [http://www.buslist.org Bodies Under Siege], but with only her and a few friends as members. Members are then sought after, but few join, and the forum is wrapped up only for a new one to be created shortly after.

However, a few that ''did'' join almost all the fora, are worth mentioning. [[Trolls]] Vicky, Flossy, Pasta, KURTCOBAINRULZ, LooLoo, and others have been haunting her for over a decade, without her catching suspicion. Little does she know that they are all her closest friends.

==Drama==

AKA the cornerstone of the Idiot's existence. Whether it's about internet-boyfriends who suddenly die when they see her picture, or [[lesbian]] lover best-friends whose non-existant daughters won't be attending her wedding if they keep acting like [[skank]]s, you'll never be bored while reading her entries.

*Seph (short for Sephiroth, believed by the Idiot to be his real name), the internet-boyfriend. Theirs was a passionate relationship, but it was not to last. Shortly after the arrival of the Idiot's picture in Sephiroth's mailbox, the young man was declared dead by none other than his mother, who personally took the time to log on with his [[MSN]]-name, and explain in great detail to the Idiot about Seph's last moments. The Idiot was crushed, and vowed to never forget her one true love. Months later, she met her next true love (number five in the row), and all was forgotten.

*Kelly, the Idiot's best friend, but they're not friends, but they are, but they're not, but they are, but they're not. Their petty disputes and constant breaking up, has left many a fan gasping for air. They've met each other all but 4 times, and they're connected by a psychic link which renders them soul mates. But they're not, but they are. Etc. She is also one of the Idiot's many love-interests, and they once roleplayed falling in love on the Idiot's fora, much to the confusion of the other members. The next day, they were not friends any more.




*There are rumours that the Department of Health sent out an agent to keep her under close observation, on suspicion of a mysterious new [[virus]] which causes acute idiocy. This individual poses as her current boyfriend. This is also, supposedly, the reason why she was recently accepted into a university. Really, there are no other explanations.
