[[Image:Epicfailvich..gif|200px|thumb|"…and by the way I should say if anybody wants to tape my conversations go right ahead – feel free to do it."]]

'''Rod "[[Fail]]" Blowjobitch''' was the self-proclaimed governor of the [[shit|shithole]] known as [[Illinois]], [[troll|tormenting]] the citizens with [[lulz|lulzy]] [[prostitute|Pay-to-Play]] tactics and selling [[Barack Obama|Barack Obama's]] senate seat to some black person whose [[Jesse Jackson|daddy]] made money by stealing from fellow blacks. Although it is believed that Blagojevich is of [[Serbia|Serbian]] descent, he is actually some sort of Serbian Jew hybrid (yes, contemplate that combination for a moment and ask yourself, "is that not [[muslims|what satan shits]]?") because of his insatiable lust for money and the blood of Christian children as well as his propensity for [[rape]] and [[bestiality|deviancy]]. He was the second [[douchebag]] to be charged last year with fucking up a state; the first being [[Eliot Spitzer]],who was another greedy jack-off with hookers and blow. Blagojevich has barricaded himself inside his multi-million dollar mansion to make sure that the [[Partyvan|authorities]] don't steal his precious [[Jew gold]], but it's pretty likely he'll be v& anyways. To make matters worse, he also had an approval rating even lower than [[W|Bush's]], which really brings up the thought that maybe his [[fail|nickname]] could have something to do with it. Blagos career was coming to an end before the feds because he cheated on his wife (the daughter of Richard Mell, a huge political kingping) with his black person nanny. Once this went down, a public feud errupted between the two.

''''nuff said'''

Made his security detail pay for ''HIS'' coffee. What the fuck?

Was the first governor in [[at least 100 years ago|100 years]] that refused to live in the capital.


==How do i fucked Illinois?==

In 2002, Rod ran for governor and won after several hours of heavy ballot rigging. He started off by taking money from the schools "because children can learn at home on their own time" and "my hairdo looks like a helmet so I am loved". He proceeded to fill his greedy Jew pockets by stealing moar money from taxpayers and pretty much everyone else in America he could [[rape|squander]] from. Soon after, the feds got pissed for Blago not giving a share of the cash and decided to wiretap his house for the lulz. After a bunch of [[IRL]] trolling on Rod, they discovered his attempts to sell the senate seat of [[Barack Obama]], even though it was pretty obvious to everyone in Illinois when he ran this ad for it:

[[Image:Buggervich.png|thumb|/[[b]]/ chimes in.]]


On [[Last Thursday|December 10th, 2008]], the [[Partyvan]] came by Blagojevich's house and gave him the banhammer, thus [[pwn|indicting]] him on [[over 9000]] counts of conspiracy, racketeering, bribery, pay-to-play shit, and a million other things that [[Shit nobody cares about|noone really cares about]], but that can still get him IRL banned for [[at least 100|30 years or more]].

==Candidate #5==

[[Image:Jackson jr kungfu.jpg|thumb|Jackson Jr. during the press conference, shortly after being questioned about his credibility.]]

While the Spitzer case had it's 'Client #9' and cheap whores, Rod had a bunch of [[liberals]] begging for his [[cock]] in order to occupy the senate seat vacated by Barack Obama after he stole the presidency - and some of the rich ones were willing to give Blagojewvich some of that sweet, sweet cash. Among those were 3 people, named Candidates 1, 2, and 5 (because the feds [[facepalm|don't know that the numbers 3 and 4 exist]]). The most notable was #5: Jesse Jackson Jr., son and cocksucker of [[bullshit|civil rights]] activist [[Jesse Jackson]], who is most likely believed to be the highest bidder of the position. He outright denied the claims in the [[Ebonics|traditional words of his people]], mixed with the most retarded sounding voice nearly surpassing that of [[fag|Barney Frank's]].

<youtube>J410Y3tpeCc</youtube>

Holy shit [[tl;dw]]. Anyway, there are numerous flaws with the assertion that he bribed Blagojevich for the senate seat, including:

1. He is a nigger so he has no money.

2. Not even Rod would be dumb enough to let another nigger have a chance at the presidency.

3. [[ALL CAPS|BECAUSE IT WAS A SIMPLE MEETING GUISE NOTHING HAPPENED I REPEAT NOTHING HAPPENED.]]

Another possible candidate for the position was [[Lesbian|Lisa Madigan]], but that's only 'cause her daddy gave her some power, so [[noone]] gives a shit about her. Most likely his buttbuddy Pat Quinn will take over for him and start yet another era of [[fail]] and [[AIDS]] in Illinois politics as long as Illinois doesn't actually kill itself after being raped for the past 9 years by both Rod and [[Republican|George Ryan]].

==Another nigger steals the senate seat==

[[Image:Shady.jpg|thumb|Rod with his real nigga.]]
[[Image:Negro community.jpg|thumb|The negro community frowns upon the shenanigans of the racist senate.]]
It turns out there was a nigger [[rape|out to get Obama's seat]] (lol, <s>no blacks currently in the senate, srsly</s> [[zerg rush|affirmative action]], biotch!), but not who we all thought it was. Instead it was some old negroid who thought he [[Unrealistic expectations|could pull off another presidential victory like his home boy Obama]]. Obviously the senate didn't need another nigger fucking up the country and refused to let him take Obama's seat, but pinned it on the fact that he forgot the signature of Jesse White on his senate approval paper (he may also have been refused because he was endorsed by the guy who's been getting [[facepalm|facepalms]] recently due to the scandal, but this is unknown). Roland immediately took the arguement that it was racism and got some of his brothas to back him up on this one. Hoping to initiate another [[The Great Habbo Raid of July 2006|Million Man March]], he went marching up the capitol to steal the <s>bike</s> senate seat back from those [[The man|bigots]], but ended up being thrown back out just like any other nigga who's marched up Capitol Hill (the only reason Obama was allowed up was because he was part white). In the wake of the whole mess the jackasses from the senate decided to [[liberal guilt|give Burris the job as senator]], even with a massive corruption trial ahead for the person who appointed him to the job.


==Obama lies about Blagojevich==

[[Image:Blagojevich and obama.jpg|thumb|Srs face tiem guise lolz]]

[[Image:Blago monkey.jpg|thumb|oh noes!!!]]

'''The [[Copypasta]]:'''

[[TL;DR|Barack Obama has attempted to distance himself from the crash and burn that is Governor Rod Blagojevich. Obama can run but he can’t hide. Obama and Blagojevich took considerable amounts of money from convicted criminal Antoine “Tony” Rezko and Obama's top aide, Michael Strautmanis, worked for Blagojevich.

Not only did Rezko give Obama money for his presidential bid and convince others to ante up, but he also advised Obama on the purchase of a new Chicago home.

In the lead-up to the election, numerous commentators pointed out Obama’s relationship with the corrupt dirtbag Rezko as well as his relationship with terrorist William Ayers. The preacher, Jeremiah “God Damn America” Wright, said that Obama could not “disown” him any more than his “white grandmother".

However, nothing would stick because the corporate media was caught up in the disgusting whirlwind of Obama mania that it had created. A few neocon trolls over at Faux News tried ever so lamely to out Obama and his various sordid relationships, but it was all for naught. After the election, Obama nominated the same old wizened and tired insiders to run his administration and just for good measure, threw in veteran Iran-Contra criminal Robert Gates: the man who created Al-Qaeda under the reprehensible William Casey. The neocons came around and applauded. It was truly a spectacle to see.

But this Blagojevich business has the ability to tarnish Obama before he enters the White House so he is desperately attempting to insert distance between himself and the Illinois snake oil salesman and political mobster who attempted to sell Obama’s Senate seat right out from under him.

In regards to the allegations surrounding Blagojevich's conspiracy to sell or trade Obama's recently vacant Senate seat for personal benefit, the President Select said on December 9th: “I had no contact with the governor or his office, and so I was not aware of what was happening.” according to the Associated Press.

Either Obama had a big time memory lapse or he is lying through his teeth.

On November 8th, KHQA 7 reported: “Now that Barack Obama will be moving to the White House, his seat in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois will have to be filled. Obama met with Governor Rod Blagojevich earlier this week to discuss it.”

A soon-to-be-President telling such big lies should be newsworthy. It’s not because the narcosis of Obama-mania is still thick in the air. Besides, most people expect Presidents to lie and start wars and sell the country down the river. Few cared when Clinton lied about “that woman” (while under oath nonetheless) and even fewer seem to care about Obama’s lie.]]

'''In other words, America's first black person President is <s>being taken down by</s> has become [[the man]].'''

==LOL IMPEACHED==
<center><youtube>OIq6Al7wdk0</youtube></center>
Charged with corruption and faggotry, in a 114-1 vote, Rod Blagojevich was impeached by the Illinois senate and will be <s>attending</s> boycotting his own trial soon. Moments after removing him from office, the Illinois Senate also voted unanimously to [[Win|'''prevent Blagojevich from ever holding political office in the state again.''']] You can catch the drama [http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/29/illinois.governor/index.html here]. "Now what was our hero Rod doing?" [[you]] might ask. Well, instead of attending his impeachment and only making one appearance at the trial to repeat the same bullshit arguement like before, Blago decided to play it [[fail|cool]] and go out for a jog. '''[[Facepalm|A FUCKING JOG.]]'''

==Quinn steps in, more faggotry ensues==
As of [[last Thursday]], Pat Quinn had officially taken Blago's [[job]]. Somehow expecting something different from Blago's vice pimp admiral, [[Liberalism|the inhabitants of the North Shore]] and [[niggers]] paid to show up praised Quinn as the end to all corruption in Illinois and stroked his [[cock]]. Invigorated by this pleasure, Quinn decided to run for governor, as his plan of running again for lieutenant governor for the next twenty years did not make his cock hard enough anymore. Quinn proceeded to do the typical to get into any office in <strike>Illinois</strike> [[Chicago]] (attack ads with the announcer quoting himself as the source, loading [[niggers]] onto a bus and giving them a hundred dollah if they vote for him, asking the North Shore for another cock-stroking, breaking into mausoleums for Jew gold and anything that could be used to register a potential voter, etc.) As expected, Quinn's campaign coffers loaded down with Jew gold won him the election, mostly because the amount of money you have is directly proportional to the number of [[niggers|political activists]] that vote for you and whether or not you win Chicago.
[[Image:Pat-Quinn 2.jpg|center|thumb|500px|Illinois is fucked. Again.]]

==Blago's Media Blitz==
Like every [[retard|smart]] politician before him, Blago tried to maintain his "innocence" by going on a bunch of talk shows and other [[old media]] that [[Nobody cares|noone watches]], though it did spark some lulz seeing as that he still thinks he can be governor.

===Blago Radio===
[[Image:Blago just as planned.jpg|thumb|[[Just as planned]]]]
Broadcasting from WLS in [[Chicago]], Blagojevich did the impossible and got to host his own radio show for the day. Mostly it was just [[TL;DR]] stuff and some call-in questions, although he did finally admit to having a bad hairdo. [http://www.wgnradio.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=48497&Itemid=603 For additional lulz, WGN is in talks with Blago for him to have is own full-time radio show].

<center>'''Some Highlights from Blago radio'''</center>

<center><youtube>WkkkxgzAeco</youtube></center>

===Survivor: Blago Edition===
Just when it seemed that Blago could not have gotten more self-absorbed (seemingly following in the ways of [[Chris-chan]]), it was recently leaked that he may be starring in his own reality-television series ([http://wgnradio.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51103&Itemid=577 No, I am not fucking kidding you]). It supposedly has to do with celebrities on some island in the Caribbean, though the term "celebrity" doesn't really apply to an ousted governor currently in the midst of a corruption trial.

'''UPDATE: [http://news-briefs.ew.com/2009/04/judge-says-rod.html LOL DENIED]'''

''''NUTHER UPDATE:''' Turns out Rod's bitch Patti Blagojevich was allowed to go on "I'm a Celebutard, Get me out of Here!", but failed miserabely right from the start. At the end of the season, she supposedly ran off with the nigger basketball player whom she was fucking with throughout the show.

===Blago the Rapper===
Yet another cereer change for our bumbling buddy:
<center><youtube>1eGellCATiQ</youtube></center>

==Why wasn't his failure noticed before?==
Well, besides residents of Illinois consisting of [[democrat|democrats]] and [[niggers]], people just couldn't see that behind the [[win|hair]] and smile was something truly terrifying taking place. Blago actually did give a warning to the [[faggots|people]] of the state, back in one of his old [[2006]] ads for his reelection as governor:

<center><youtube>m89gtxeG1z4</youtube></center>

==The future of Rod==

[[Image:Blagojevich-self-hate.jpg|thumb|left|Rod with one of his adoring supporters (more like adoring supporter amirite?)]]

Despite all the charges, Blagojevich still plans to [[Unrealistic expectations|keep his job as governor of Illinois and eventually run for president in 2016]], that is, until the feds send him to prison, though he'll probably just pay them off with part of the gigantic pile of money in his room. He said he might run for the Senate (CANDIDATE #5, ANYONE???) but that's bullshit because although he had the power to appoint ''[[You|anyone]]'' to the senate seat left by Obama, all the democrats in the Illinois party hate him and don't want anything to do with him even if he spills the beans on their corruption scandals as well.
