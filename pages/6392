Phoebe Prince was a [[16-year-old girl|15-year old]] [[fact|Irish slut]] who lived in [[white|South]] [[liberal|Hadley]], [[Massachusetts]]. She was repeatedly trolled in school and on [[Facebook]] for having a train run on her by her school's [[jock|football team]]. Unfortunately for Phoebe, the star quarterback's bottom bitch found out. She rallied her [[bitches|friends]] together to rightfully persecute the obvious [[whore|wrong-doer]], Phoebe. For weeks she was relentlessly physically and mentally bullied by the jealous pack of girls. On [[last thursday|January 14, 2010]] she was hit in the head by a can thrown from a moving car, which knocked some sense through her drunken mick skull. She now realized that [[suicide|the only way to get even with the bullies was to hang herself]]. As she is [[Catholic]], she is most certainly [[Satan|burning in unimaginable anguish]], and will continue to do so until the end of time. 

==The Shitstorm ==
After Phoebe's death, the [[concerned mother]]s of Massachusetts wrote letters of [[butthurt]] to black person saying that bullying is rampant and must be [[illegal|outlawed]]. Governor Patrick has now spent more time trying to get anti-bullying laws passed than dealing with the major flood damage in Massachusetts. The nine students caught bullying now face jail time but also take pride in their ability to turn an average girl into an legendary hero.

This case has garnered ridiculous amounts of attention from the national media. Because Phoebe was not toothless or fat, news networks were able to plaster her face across television as the poster child for anti-bullying. This could have huge ramifications for [[trolls|typical internet users]] as this wave of BAWWWWW has made irl trolling taboo.
