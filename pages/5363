'''Michelle Belanger''', aka Sethanikeem, aka Puggles, aka Swamp Donkey, a self-proclaimed [[Transgender]] [[vampire]] [[BDSM|Dominatrix]], is the supposed founder and mastermind behind [[House Kheperu]]. I say 'supposed' because I wouldn't put it past her to try to steal someone else's thunder and ideas. She is [[lies|well versed and edumacated]], but she is also a raging [[attention whore]]. She believes herself to be one of the "[[insane|first psychic vampires in existence]]", a physical descendant of the Nephilim (you know, those mythological figures of Christian lore that God sent the Great Flood specifically to kill?  I guess God doesn't pay attention to the details and one or two got away) and a reincarnated pre-historic Egyptian priest.  She made a [[cult]], [[House Kheperu]], to glorify these things. 

Funny enough, Psychic Vampire was a phrase coined by Anton Levay and it's hardly complimentary. It refers to someone who takes and takes from [[you]] but contributes nothing, which describes Michelle, but I don't think that's how she wants people to see her.

Unlike other attention whores with delusions of grandeur, she is very articulate and charming... if you are in possession of a pussy and like to [[Dyke|lick carpet]]. Though she prefers the hole to the pole, she has been known to jump in the sack with men who she believes are in possession of [[otherkin|other worldly power]], or if she simply wants to be in their good graces.  Either way, she ends up trying to steal the lime light from them and either they kick her to the curb or she gets bored with them and abandons them.

Michelle likes to portray herself as an [[Insane Clown Posse|over-dramatic creature of the night]], often affecting a [[Hillary Clinton|fake accent to score cool points.]] She has made appearances on several television shows over the past few years, and has spoken at quite a few college campuses and book signings on the wonders that are [[vampire|vampirism]] and BDSM. She is dedicated to spreading the word about her own [[shit nobody cares about|greatness and the greatness of the cluster fuck known as the vampire community]].  If she finds a couple of salivating animu fantards that will let her smack them around with a riding crop, that's also a plus.

Despite claiming to be an "expert" on vampirism and paranormal phenomena, she has no formal education or training on the subjects she speaks of. This is understandable as [[lulz|none of it is fucking real]].

==Michelle Debunked!!==

{{quote|USA PSI asked Belanger to participate in an impromptu Zener card-guessing experiment, a classic parapsychological test used to determine extrasensory perception (ESP) ability.

She scored seven cards correct out of 25, an average of 28 percent accuracy. Pure chance scores would be five cards right, an average of 20 percent.

To get a complete idea of one's ESP abilities, notable parapsychologist Dr. Carroll B. Nash insists that a minimum of 250 trials be conducted (as in USA PSI's own ESP research study that concluded last week).

Belanger was unable to produce electromagnetic field (EMF) fluctuation, citing travel-related issues and no access to an energy source.

She declined when USA PSI volunteered themselves as energy sources, indicating that she refused to feed off of strangers. Belanger claims to be highly sensitive to human energy fields under optimum conditions. | [http://www.usavanguard.com/psychic-vampires-walk-among-us-1.856412 The Vanguard]}}

==Michelle and House Kheperu's spiritual beliefs==

Here are some excerpts from [http://www.sacred-texts.com/goth/vc/index.htm Michelle's handbook] for her cult, [[House Kheperu]]:

"The Greater Initiation involves a ritual '''death''' and rebirth which occurs on both the physical and spiritual levels for the initiate. It is visionary and shamanic in nature and forces the initiate to face himself and all that he has been within the boundaries of his own soul. Like all deaths and rebirths, this ritual strips away old identities and assumptions. The little self of this lifetime is subsumed into the greater Self, and the initiate is irrevocably changed. This rite is reserved for only the strongest minds, for any who are weak or filled with fear '''may not survive the initiation'''."

"'''We are predators at heart, even though we are physically indistinguishable from our prey'''. "  Prey here refers to normal human beings.

"Feeding from the [[otherkin|Awakened]] is far more rewarding, as they cultivate their energy bodies, and so the quality of energy is purer and more intense. However, feeding without permission from the Awakened runs you the risk of getting caught."  Yes, she just advocated preying on other vampires and otherkin to her cult.

"Do not be misled by the juxtaposition of energy and blood. No cut or puncture is necessary for the transfer to occur. Our ways are far subtler than that. As you draw out life, you draw out a minute amount of blood with the life. Even when there is no physical contact between you and your partner, when the draw is deep enough, this will occur.  For this reason, always take care in who you feed from, for a taint in their blood may carry over to you."  YES, she just said you can get AIDS from being a psychic vampire!

"By tugging gently on the link with the person, you can make them think of you and draw them to you.  With concentration, an especially strong link will enable you to extend your awareness completely enough so your are able to perceive through the other person's senses."


==An accurate assessment on Michelle and House Kheperu==

{{quote|Her followers will tell you that if she was really a fraud then she wouldn't be as popular as she is, but people can be fooled, and the more desperate they are for guidance, the easier they are to fool because when people get deperate they are more willing to BE fooled, but just because there are many who believe does not mean they are right.
I will say the word Jonestown and leave you this link for further information.
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown 909 dead in mass suicide].
These people also believed the lies told them, unfortunately it cost them more than the large amount of dollars Belanger usually fleeces her believers for in book buying costs and membership fees. It cost them their lives.
I wait for the time when Belanger and her close allies will also demand more of their following than money.
The Jonestown incident was a tragedy, if it is allowed to happen again it will be a crime. Please be careful of those who instead of telling you what they believe would tell you what you should believe.
Of course this is just my opinion.| [http://otherkin.30.forumer.com/a/vampire-code_post1038.html "Come to Me", an unusually observant otherkin]}}

==Biggest WTF Claims==

* She says that if she doesn't "feed" she will fall victim to heart failure and that the practice has kept her from needing a transplant.  If this is true then there are millions of people in desperate need for heart transplants that she could help.  Does she though?  Of course not.

* She says her name is French for "beautiful angel" to reinforce her claim that she is a living decedent of the Nephilim race, but there are no sources that confirm this.  Sure, bel is beautiful and ange is angel, but her name isn't spelled Belange (even though she lies and says that's how Belanger is pronounced).  She is the only member of her family to boast that this is the actual translation.  It's more likely an English (or even [http://www.4crests.com/belanger-coat-of-arms.html Germanic]) name than French.  Also, only hack-job amateur genealogists will give you the "beautiful angel" crap.  The name probably originated as [http://www.ancestry.com/facts/belanger-family-history.ashx Beringer] if it is indeed French, which means "strong as a bear".  Most sites online will tell you [http://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp.fc/qx/belanger-family-crest.htm this bit] of information.  Notice how any mention of angels is absent.  

* Due to "past life" experience she believes the US is heading for another depression [http://sethanikeem.livejournal.com/214002.html].  Quite frankly, it doesn't take "an eternity old soul" to see that not just the US but the '''global economy''' was fucked in the ass by the Bush administration (really, just turn on CNN and you will see all sorts of paranoid dribble from fucking EXPERTS who don't claim they had "wing like growths" removed as a child).    

* Though she now likes to claim her moniker "sethanikeem" is because if she was born male she would have been named Seth, she used to say it was because she felt a deep connection to the god of the underworld, [http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/set.htm Set].  She likes to claim that "anikeem" is Ancient Egyptian for angel, but the concept of such a being is foreign to the culture.  Any winged figures were representations of deities, who weren't believed to be in possession  of mystical helpers.

* Since she believes she is an ancient Egyptian Priest, Michelle thinks she knows everything about the language.  The truth of the matter is, she finds words that she thinks are pretty or have a "deep meaning" and then mashes them together to form a new word that "modern anthropologists don't know about because it is so old" or some other bullshit. The obvious mendacity of this dodge is indicated by its being ''exactly'' the same one used by [[Mormons]] to explain why Joseph Smith's translations of known hieroglyphs are [[shit]].  When asked to explain the words she has made up or "remembered" from her [[bullshit|past lives]], she always skirts the issue and never gives any concrete sources or definitions.  Swamp Donkey's 'knowledge' doesn't only extend to the language (unable to read or understand any form of Egyptian, not to mention the same idiocy when it comes to hieroglyphs), but also to the history and archaeology of Ancient Egypt. Get a beginner's guide to Egyptian archaeology and test it out for great [[lulz]]. Of course, her hapless minions will jump to her defense, which just makes all of it more funny.

==Internet Drama==
===Wikipedia===

Michelle has taken to slandering other authors and pimping her shit on Wikipedia.  Or at least she had been until the admins realized WTF she was doing.  She has since been permabanned and will go on butt-hurt tirades about how they discriminated against her.  

She also likes to complain that everything unflattering on her [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Belanger wiki page] is false (including the fact she has claimed to be born with a penis in the past), but all of the information provided there has come out of her mouth in interviews and press releases.

4. PROFIT

Recently a post was made on /x/ about Michelle's cult members stalking and threatening to rape and kill people who submitted negative reviews. 

==A candidate for Schizophrenia==
[[Image:Michellecthulu.jpg|thumb|INTERNET DISEASE WON'T SAVE YOU NOW, MICHELLE!!]]
[[Image:Michelleb08.jpg|thumb|left|ONE OF US, ONE OF US]]

Michelle has shown on [[over 9000|numerous]] occasions that she has a hard time keeping fantasy separated from reality.  She often infuses philosophy and rules from mythology she's misinterpreted, fictional books, games and movies into her [[House Kheperu|cult]] and encourages her followers to post totally far fetched and random bullshit that to her eyes totally justify and prove her totally made up theories.

This isn't surprising though, as Michelle Belanger is just a totally absorbed and disillusioned roleplayer that took things too far. She didn't start out in the [[vampire]] community, but  the LARP community.  Before she started writing on "[[lies|occult truths]]" she moderated and participated in many games.  

Her ties to role-playing are evident to this day in her choice of lingo and manner of dress.  Saying she dresses like [[Anne Rice|Lestat's]] even gayer evil brother is an under statement.

It is rumored that she still participates to this day in the game, but it has been rumored that the rumor was started to defame Michelle and that she is above that childishness.  

Take a look at her websites and decide for yourself.

==[[Pagan]] Icon and Author==
[[Image:OSHITLOL.JPG|thumb|125px|left|Michelle,the elderly lesbian magickal vampiyah of evol. Needs a swift kick to the cunt.]]
[[Image:Blueskullrsd.jpg|thumb|Before she cut her hair off, she actually resembled a woman.]]

Over the years Michelle has published a number of books on the occult, vampirism and sex with [[otherkin|angels]].  Most of her releases are poorly manufactured and marketed pulp novels, but in recent years she has had releases from two notable (if you're [[wicca|Wiccan]], that is) publishers.  Llewellyn and Weiser, who are known for their flaky pop-culture inspired products and shady authors who make [http://www.stopsylvia.com Sylvia Browne] look ethical. 

Most of her [[goatse|erotic]] fiction is either self-published and purchasable online, or through random [[goth|gothic]] back-alley publishers who are gone in a couple months.  This is understandable, as no competent business person would touch her low-brow uninspired smut.

Her most notorious release is [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578633214/ref=s9_asin_image_1/102-7336151-5592942?n=283155 The Psychic Vampire Codex] which has garnered jeers and sneers from [[vampires]] and skeptics alike due to her shameless self-promotion and gloating.  There is very little information (I use this term to describe ideas other than "Michelle/House Kheperu is awesome") in this book.  It's basically Michelle's tale of how she formed and liberated the vampire community (that predates her foray into LARP) and everyone there in should bow down, suck her cock, and join her cult.  No, seriously.

Whoring of her writing can be found [http://www.michellebelanger.com/books.php here] and [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/105-5797506-2732456?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Michelle%20A.%20Belanger here].  But if you don't feel like paying, follow some of these links:

*excerpt from [http://www.lulu.com/browse/preview.php?fCID=172984 '''Sacred Hunger'''].  It's just enough to let you know what a delusional bat she is (if you had any doubts).
*excerpt from [http://www.lulu.com/browse/preview.php?fCID=369071 '''The Vampire Ritual Book'''].  Her "real" books about the [[occult]] are almost indistinguishable from her fiction. 
*[http://www.scribd.com/doc/1037522/The-Vampire-Codex-by-Michelle-Belanger-2000 '''The Vampire Codex'''], a handbook for her cult [[House Kheperu]].
*[http://www.sacred-texts.com/goth/vc/index.htm '''The Psychic Vampire Codex'''], online edition.  A great number of [[lulz]] from the printed version have been omitted.
*Her [http://www.lulu.com/michellebelanger Lulu storefront] is full of [[lulz]].

Look out for [http://www.amazon.com/This-Heart-Flame-Michelle-Belanger/dp/1600761518 This Heart of Flame] where Michelle fantasizes about being a man who gets corn holed regularly.

==Michelle as an entertainer==
Michelle has tried her hand at [http://www.flickr.com/photos/sethanikeem modeling], [http://www.myspace.com/michellebelanger singing] and acting, thus giving trolls ammo and gawkers everywhere mild [[lulz]].  The fact that she has declared herself a spokes-vamp for the entire [[cult|community]] out side of [[House Kheperu]] ensures that we have [[over 9000|numerous]] [[lulz]] around Halloween when every network airs their shitty [[vampire]] specials in an attempt to scare and gross-out normal folks and give aging [[goth]]s like Michelle a [[usi|self-rightous]] hard on.

===OH SHIT, MICHELLE IS ON TELEVISION===

Her status as an expert on the vampire subculture recently got her on [http://cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/player/popup/?rn=3906861&cl=11012526&ch=4226713&src=news FOX News], trying to look all serious and legit and scaring the [[NORP]]s of America by saying "ZOMG VAMPIRES TTLY GO TO CHURCH!!!"  Any [[EDiot|reasonable person]] knows this is utter bullshit because the only time vampires ever leave their parents basement is they've grown out of it.

Michelle has appeared several times on a ghost hunting TV show called "Paranormal State" [http://www.aetv.com/paranormal-state]. On the show she plays an [[IRL]] psychic (OH FUCK, wut ?!  Not a vampire or angel or Egyptian priest or nephilim). Paranormal State is a "docu-drama reality television series".  More info about Paranormal State can be found [http://paranormalstateillustrated.com/paranormal_state/HOME.html here].

[[Image:Michelle raven.jpg|thumb|left|With another potential victim.]]

She has had alliances with [[Don Henrie]] and [[Todd Hoyt]] in the past.  Don claimed that she was trying to make him into her puppet, so he pushed her away.  She is scorned, but she still hangs onto him, trying to drain out anything she can from his already dead career and non-existent fame.

She was friends with Todd, going so far as to call him [[incest|her brother]].  When they broke off their friendship,  she not only bad mouthed the [[sick fuck]], she claimed he stole her material (which she stole from various role playing games, creating a black hole of [[copyright infringement]]).

She wrote about it in her [http://sethanikeem.livejournal.com/135896.html livejournal], and then proceeded to heavily edit the complaints.  This is the post in its [[TL;DR|unedited entirety]]:

{{quote|"This post is an open letter intended to reach all of you in [[livejournal]] land and [[Myspace|beyond]]. I am hoping that as many of [[you]] in the [[vampire]] [[cult|community]] as possible stop by to read this. For those of you not interested in [[vampire]] [[faggotry|politics]], I suggest you just move along, [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|or simply read this for curiosity's sake]].

[[At least 100 years ago|Since late 1998]], I have worked with [[Todd Hoyt|Father Sebastian Todd]]. Our initial [[sex|partnership]] began after my work was [[rape|plagiarized]] in his [[douche|Vampyre]] Almanac 1998-1999. The material [[rape|plagiarized]] [[shit nobody cares about|was originally published in the 1997 Monolith Graphics Art Calendar]]. I touch upon this in my book, The Psychic Vampire Codex, but at [[Todd Hoyt|Sebastian's]] insistence, left out the specified incident of [[rape|plagiarism]] because he did not want to [[sick fuck|look bad]].

At the time, [[Todd Hoyt|Father Sebastian]] alleged that he had no idea who sent him the material. As reparation, he offered to have me write for the next Almanac -- [[oh noes|without pay, of course]]. To this day, I am certain that [[Todd Hoyt|Todd]] himself [[rape|plagiarized]] my [[shit|work]], and this knowledge in part influenced my decision to work with him on future [[sex|projects]].

This may seem counter-intuitive, but I had been [[rape|plagiarized]] before, and as a relative no-name, I had discovered just how hard it is to call [[Waaaambulance|someone to task]] for [[almost raped|intellectual theft]]. [[Unrealistic Expectations|I felt that if I worked with a known plagiarist, at least I would have some say in how my work was presented and I would be much more likely to be able to keep my name attached to that work]]. In later years, another factor that kept me [[sex|working]] with [[Todd Hoyt|Todd]] was the fact that I could [[fellatio|influence]] him to be less [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|destructive]] to the [[cult|community]] -- my revisions of the black person Veil [[usi|are a sign of this]], as [[Todd Hoyt|Todd's]] version that first appeared on the Sanguinarium website was criticized by many as reading like a bad rehash of The Traditions of the Masquerade. [[pwn|It was]].

[[Last Thursday|Last week]], after many long and eventful [[sex|years]], my [[cult|House]] and I decided to bring our [[sex|association]] with [[Todd Hoyt|Father Sebastian Todd]] to an end. For [[orgy|multiple]] [[butthurt|infractions]] that have built up over a span of years but have specifically reached a [[cock|head]] over the past 8 months, [[Todd Hoyt|Father Sebastian Todd]] is no longer an [[fuck buddy|ally]] of [[House Kheperu]]. Subsequently, he is no longer someone who can use our name, reprint our work, "borrow" our ideas, or otherwise continue to enlarge his own [[cock|projects]] with our [[bullshit|creativity]], [[lie|inspiration]], or [[usi|reputation]].

First, I want everyone to understand that this was not done lightly. Ever since I first started [[sex|working]] the [[Todd Hoyt|Father Sebastian Todd]] in 1998, I have had [[Anonymous|various people]] approach me and warn me not to [[fuck|work with]] him. More people than I can count have approached me over the years with complaints against him and reasons for why our association should end. Until recently, [[what|I never felt there was sufficient evidence for such a drastic move]]. However, over the course of the past year or so, a number of events, incidents, disagreements, and issues have built to a point where the cessation of his ally status was inevitable.

[[lie|When the infractions are based on material reported to us by another, be assured that we have acquired the text of letters, IM logs, chat transcripts, and other primary evidence to back up each individual's claims. Furthermore, the individual infractions are not limited to single incidents but represent a repeated pattern that cannot at this point be resolved. The material we have on file will remain private as it contains peoples' names and we have no desire to spread further drama and recriminations throughout the community. Just understand that by our exacting standards, it is more than sufficient to prove each case.]]

Here are the main points that inspired this radical decision:

Primary Infractions of [[Todd Hoyt|Father Sebastian Todd]]:

Stating that [[House Kheperu]] is sponsoring events without first gaining permission from the House. Further, not even notifying [[cult|House]] Members that we were supposedly sponsoring the events

Presenting himself under a known [[sock puppet|alternate ID]] as an ally of [[House Kheperu]] to other [[cult|houses]] and then implying or outright stating that [[House Kheperu]] supports the issues and/or policy changes he is attempting to enforce in said [[cult|houses]].

Reprinting [[shit|material]] from members of the [[cult|House]] in his publications without first acquiring permission to do so. ([[rape|plagiarism]])

Frequently taking ideas and partial writings from the [[cult|House]] for reprint in his own publications without proper attribution. ([[almost raped|intellectual theft]])

[[Defamation|Misrepresenting concepts, ideas, and teachings]] from [[House Kheperu]].

Attempting to recruit an [[Don Henrie|established member]] of [[House Kheperu]]. Furthermore, attempting to use [[sex]] to do so, via a [[whore|third party]].<nowiki>*</nowiki>

[[Defamation|Misrepresenting]] [[House Kheperu]] and/or its members to potential [[victim|members]] and other individuals within the [[cult|community]].

Ordinarily, when someone becomes an [[fuck buddy|ally]] or [[Lesbian Break-Up|loses that status]], we [[lie|treat it as a private matter]]. It is only because of the very public identity of [[Todd Hoyt|Sebastian]] and the widely known nature of our [[sex|association]] that we make this a public matter on our boards. [[lie|For the sake of peace in the community]], we do not wish to debate the matter further.

We also wish to take this time to apologize to anyone in any [[cult|order, coven, or house]] who has been approached by [[Todd Hoyt|Todd]], a member of [[cult|House Sahajza]], or its affiliates using our name. If any person claiming to be [[sick fuck|abbon]] of [[House Kheperu]] has attempted to inform you of our opinions or policies, they had no right to speak with our voice. They did this [[rape|without our knowledge or our consent]].

[[House Kheperu]] has [[lie|no interest in dictating policy to other houses or individuals]]. If someone attempts to tell you what to do, using our name to back up their credibility, they are abusing both us and you.

If you run a [[vampire]]-related [[cult|House, Order]], or Website, please [[whore|reprint]] this letter in its entirety. I am especially distressed to learn that [[Todd Hoyt|Todd]] frequently used my name and the name of [[House Kheperu]] in private correspondence to lend credibility to his claims and demands. He never had permission to do this. If he has run an event and our name has been attached to it, he has never even asked if he could use that name. Some [[cp|abuses]] I can tolerate when it's for the good of the [[cult|community]], but too many of the liberties he has taken with us have hurt the community I love.

--Michelle Belanger

<nowiki>*</nowiki>[[lie|Ordinarily, we have no problem with our members joining other organizations. It is the fact that Sebastian has railed against other individuals who have sought to recruit his members that we take this into consideration at all. Our members can come and go as they please]], but we feel that by Sebastian's own standards, a concerted effort to draw them away represents a serious insult to us and our House."|TL;DR Michelle A. Belanger}}</div>

These "issues" only became a problem when she wasn't involved in [[Todd Hoyt|Todd's]] sex life anymore.
