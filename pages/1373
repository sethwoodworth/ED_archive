Cataclaw
'''Cataclaw is a total faggot who has no life'''<br>
The above line will likely be found during Cataclaw's hourly google search of his own nickname.  This [[Basement_dweller|basement dweller]] will likely be [[butthurt]] and blank this page to further increase the [[lulz]]. <br> You can thank him for the [[lulz]] in person at Quakecon.  You can see exactly where he will sit because he posted it on his site:  [http://www.cataclaw.com/qcon/ http://www.cataclaw.com/qcon/]

==Cataclaw's life==
[[Image:goatsegame.jpg|thumb|right|Cataclaw [[goatse]] replica map is Cataclaw's best work]]
* Taking webcam pics of his kitty
* Spending 12 hours a day on [[YTMND]]
* Making shitty [[Gloom]] maps.
* Googling his nickname
* Talking about Qcon.
* Making stupid shit like [http://dumbdownvoters.ytmnd.com/ this].
* Making non-existant maps like STG
* Blanking the [[Gloom]] page because he's [[butthurt]] by it.

== WTF is STG? ==
STG stands for Star Trek [[Gloom]], which Cataclaw announced it's debut [[At_least_100_years_ago|at least 100 years ago]].  He made 2 startrek hallways which instakill you and threatened E-death to anybody who copied his work.  Some thoughtful people who suck at making maps copied his STG hallways and fabricated a big orange penis and balls which shoot rectangular cum and insert into the waiting photoshopped mouth of Cataclaw when button is pressed.
[[Image:Gloomstg.png|The map STG is available to download from many different servers. ]]

Priceless [[Butthurt]] momentum building up as [[User:Cataclaw|Cataclaw]] deletes Gloom article on ED.  Lulz ensue.
