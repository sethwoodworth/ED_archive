When [[Ryan733]] asked for an [[arbchat]] lulz were inevitable.

<pre>
* Sheneequa has changed the topic to: Ryan733's arbchat | weev is chair | pm an op if you have something important to say and you need +v
<weev> alright this is a forum for civil discussion and compromise
<weev> so i expect everyone to conduct themselves in a fair and civil manner
<weev> Ryan733: first state who you are and what material on ED you have a problem with
<Ryan733> im a user of ED and i have a problem with http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Ryan733
<Ryan733> some people on the vent i go on posted it
<Sheneequa> HKK: Please pm me
<weev> okay
<Ryan733> there is pictures of me on it and also some personal info such as my IP and name in the history that they posted before
<weev> why is this a problem to you
<Sheneequa> Ryan733 I only see your first name
<Ryan733> because their is personal info and pictures of me on it
<Ryan733> in the history tab their is my last name/ip
<weev> okay well, that isnt indexed by google
<weev> and obviously the people harassing you already have it
<Ryan733> yeah
<Sheneequa> and no one else is gonna dig it for your stuff
<weev> it seems to me you tried to blank the article
<weev> do you have a problem with the entirety of the article?
<Ryan733> yeah, but thats wehn i didnt know blanking was against the rules
<weev> it seems to me you just don't like people making fun of you on the internet.
<weev> Ryan733: how much do you weigh?
<Ryan733> and i tried to blank the personal info
<Ryan733> lol why?
<weev> well, the article has certain accusations
<weev> it claims you are fat
<Sheneequa> Ryan733: Please co-operate if you want a friendly court.
<Ryan733> i don;t weight 400
<weev> so i'd like to put your height and weight into the BMI calculator
<Ryan733> about 200
<weev> okay how tall are you?
<Ryan733> 5'10
<Sheneequa> weev: HKK alextide32 and staticman are all writers of the article
<Sheneequa> also PiotrRasputin
<Ryan733> they helped get pics and stuff
<Sheneequa> Alright HKK and alextide32 deny writing the article
<Ryan733> ok
<Sheneequa> But they are from the vent server and can shine some light on the case
<weev> okay
<weev> your BMI is 28.7
<weev> that is ft
<weev> the accusation stands as scientifically proven fair
<Ryan733> it was piotr and static who wrote stuff
<Ryan733> lol
<weev> okay
<weev> do you eat foods with butter?
<weev> it says you love butter.
<Ryan733> nope
<Sheneequa> dude everyone loves butter
<weev> i would like to note for the record that Ryan733 has shown willful contempt of arbchat by purjuring himself
