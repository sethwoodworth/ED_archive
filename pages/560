Antoine Dodson
{{potential}}

[[Image:Jaoloaaco.jpg|thumb|200px|Antoine warns about Al Qaeda]]'''Antoine Dodson''' is a notable [[GNAA|African American]] living in the [[ghetto|beautifully diverse]] neighborhood of [[Linkin Park|Lincoln Park]] in Huntsville, [[Alabama]]. He became [[Jellyous|jealous]] that the rapist who broke into the home he [[basement dweller|shares with his family]] passed him up for [[almost raped|his sister]]. Since the perp was [[not gay]], Antoine instead helped save sis from [[surprise sex]] in her own bed.

[[Old media|Local news]] covered the story, and included an [[awesome|interview with Antoine]], and [[boring|his sister]].

YouTubers quickly appreciated the hilarity of an interview with the [[gay|super-flamboyant]] Antoine and remix videos were swiftly produced. He is not yet a member of the [[GNAA]]. 

==The Original Interview==

{{Quote2|Well, obviously, we have a rapist in Lincoln Park. He's climbin in your windows, he's snatchin yo people up, tryin to rape 'em, so y'all need to hide yo kids, hide yo wife, and hide yo husband, cuz they rapin errbody out here.|Antoine Dodson|on life in the projects|color=silver|size=360%}}

{{Quote2|We got yo tshirt, you left fingerprints and all. You are so dumb... you are really dumb, fo real.|Antoine Dodson|on the perp [[doing it wrong]]|color=silver|size=360%}}

{{Quote2|You don't have to come and confess that you did it. We lookin fo you, we gon find you. I'm lettin you know dat nah, so you can run and tell dat. Homeboy!! *rolls eyes*|Antoine Dodson||color=silver|size=360%}}

==Local News Station Freaks Out About People Watching Their Videos==
<video type="youtube" id="-hdC16-cTQ0" width="480" height="360" desc="Local news station learning about how the Internet works." frame="true" position="center"/>
The local news station [[rage|freaked]] out when one of their interns visited the internet and found out people were [[piracy|watching copies]] of their show covering Dodson. One news anchor, having recently read an NYT article about viral videos, thought this was important and decided to cash in. They contacted Dodson again, wearing the attire of a fashionable [[GNAA|gay nigger]], and interviewed him about the [[shit nobody cares about|Internet]].

==White Woman==
<video type="youtube" id="4gVMkH0HmjQ" width="480" height="360" desc="Dodson doing the hair of a white woman" frame="true" position="center"/>
Dodson has further proved that all black men [[rape|love]] white women, even if they are [[homosexual|gay]]. This video also makes the [[not racist|racial]] statement that white [[whores|women]] are, overall, more desirable. Not just for [[rape|loving]], but for their [[ugly|sexy]] hair. 
He has launched a [[Youtube|Jewtube]] channel in which he will continue to post his [[rape|interactions]] with white women. He also claimed the video was the #1 [[bullshit| most watched video on youtube]]

==Rap Video==

<video type="youtube" id="hMtZfW2z9dw" width="480" height="360" desc="Dodson says he's never seen the perp before, but sends this warning to whoever is responsible." frame="true" position="center"/> 



Made because [[T-Pain|Auto Tune]] is what everyone must add to any video that has any amount of [[lulz]] in it, thus [[kill it with fire|killing]] the lulz like [[AIDS]] killed the [[You|gays]]. [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|Disregard]] the fact that we posted this as Video of the Now [[Last Thursday|last Thursday]].

===Extended Rap Version===

<video type="youtube" id="VKsVSBhSwJg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" width="480" height="360" desc="She has your SCENT, homeboy. Dodson offers a description of the perp." frame="true" position="center"/> 






Made because the original creators of the video were angry at the [[pirate|fags]] stealing their video and REPOSTING it to gain a few [[lulz]] and completely succeeding. They tried preventing [[newfag|newfags]] from [[theft|stealing]] it by putting their picture at the beginning and end of the video.
