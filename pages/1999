'''Daniel A. Bailey, Jr.''' is a [[hobosexual]] [[internet celebrity]] who had his fifteen minutes of fame [[last Thursday]] when he was [[bitch]]-slapped by [[The Man|Angelo Mozilo]], [[Shit nobody cares about|the CEO of his mortgage lender Countrywide]], after his pathetic attempt to beg Countrywide to give him [[money]]. Being a whiny [[liberal]] [[fag]], [[Communism|Comrade]] Bailey of course could not contain his [[butthurt]] and therefore posted his sob story on a forum, where it was picked up by various bloggers, who let their [[Basement dweller|regulars]] in on the [[drama]]. [[Over 9000]] blog commenters then proceeded to join in on Dan Bailey's [[BAW|bawwing]], using his experience as [[Fact|definitive proof]] that [[capitalism]] is the root of all [[Scientology|evil]].

==How it all went down==
[[Image:Cycle.gif|thumb|Quick! Find Dan Bailey!]]
After realizing that he had spent entirely too much of his income on [[porn]], [[DevianTART]] commissions, and [[Scientology]] fees to have anything left for house payments, Dan Bailey panicked and [[Spam|spammed]] [[Over 9000|twenty]] Countrywide employees with a [[Fail|hardship letter]] in a vain attempt to keep them from [[Pwnt|foreclosing on his ass]]. Having dulled what little intelligence he had with [[Drug|drugs]] and [[Fox News|television]], Bailey [[Retard|could not think of a single original thing to write]] to get sympathy. He ripped off a [[LOL|form letter]] from a random [[Socialism|loan workout]] site in the [[Unrealistic expectations|belief]] that the [[TL;DR|boilerplate misfortunes described therein]] would help his cause.

===Original email===

The [[TL;DR]] [[emo]] letter that Dan Bailey [[copypasta]]'d and spammed Countrywide with:

[[Fag|I]] am writing this letter to explain my [[Butthurt|unfortunate set of circumstances]] that have caused me to become [[Fail|delinquent]] on my mortgage. [[Lie|I have done everything in my power to make ends meet]] but unfortunately I have [[Erectile dysfunction|fallen short]] and would like you to consider working with me to modify my loan. My number one goal is to keep my home that I have lived in for sixteen years, remodeled with my own [[LOLWUT|sweat equity]] and I would really appreciate the opportunity to do that. [[Bullshit|My home is not large or in an upscale neighborhood]], it is a [[Shit nobody cares about|“shotgun” bungalow style]] of [[Over 9000|only 900]] sq. ft. built [[At least 100|in 1921]]. I moved into this home [[Last Thursday|in May of 1992]]…this was the same year I got clean and sober from [[Hookers and blow|drugs and alcohol]], and [[Lie|have been ever since]], [[Ghetto|this home]] means the world to me.

The main reason that caused me to have a hardship and to be late is my [[Retard|misunderstanding of the original loan]]. [[Bullshit|I was told that after the first year of payments, I would be able to refinance to a better fixed rate]]- then the bottom fell out of the industry. My payments for that first year were on time. I also lost my second income due to [[AIDS|physical conditions]] in a very [[Prostitute|physically demanding industry]].

As my ARM payments increased, I have had less money to put towards [[Porn|making my business (income) work]]. I had been unable to generate business because all of my funds were going towards attempting to make my loan payments. This, coupled with major repairs to my vehicle (93 jeep) and paying out of pocket for medical and dental issues (I have no ins.) caused me to fall further and further behind, destroying my [[Anus|credit rating]].

Now, it’s to the point where [[Poor|I cannot afford to pay what is owed]] to [[Jews|Countrywide]]. [[Lie|It is my full intention to pay what I owe]]. But at this time I have exhausted all of my income and resources so I am turning to you for [[Rape|help]].

I feel that a loan modification would benefit us both. With that, and knowing my home will not be foreclosed, I would be able to obtain a [[Homosexual|roommate]] in order to generate more income, Jew and have a good working relationship with Countrywide. [[Unrealistic expectations|I would appreciate if you can work with me to lower my delinquent amount owed and payment so I can keep my home and also afford to make amends with your firm]].

I truly hope that you will consider [[Rape|working with]] me and I am anxious to get this settled so we all can move on.

[[Bullshit|Sincerely and Respectfully]],

Daniel A Bailey Jr.|[[Fag|Unknown letter writer]], being ripped off by Dan Bailey}}<br></div>
Summary: [[Waaaambulance]] time!

===Angelo Mozilo's reply===
The CEO of Countrywide, [[Internet asshole|Angelo Mozilo]], called Dan Bailey on his copypasta [[bullshit]], reacting as violently as if Bailey had accused him of not being [[Metrosexual|tan]] enough. However, in a textbook example of [[Fail|failing]] at the [[internets]], he [[Doing it wrong|pressed the Reply button instead of Forward]], meaning that Dan Bailey could see exactly what Mozilo thought about his whiny email:
{{quote|This is unbelievable. Most of these letters now have the same wording. Obviously they are being counseled by some other person or by the [[internet]]. [[Fact|Disgusting]].|Angelo Mozilo, discerning the [[truth]]}}

The [[I'm so confused|confused]] and [[Emo|saddened]] Dan Bailey proceeded to [http://www.loansafe.org/forum/countrywide-home-loans-tell-us-your-countrywide-story/2759-what-mozillo-thinks.html sound off to the internet] about his [[Lulz|woes]]. Responses were fast, furious, and quite [[lulzy]]. Drama mainly came from the fight between [[Lie|righteous]] [[Republican]] capitalists with a [[Batshit insane|healthy belief]] in individual responsibility and [[Furry|depraved]] [[Democrat|leftists]] who hate business in general, Countrywide in particular, and [[Why do you hate America?|America]] overall.

==Countrywide covers its ass==
Fearing that the extreme amounts of drama occurring on various [[Shit nobody cares about|financial blogs]] would escalate into a [[Communist]] revolution, Countrywide acted quickly to spread the minimum amount of bullshit needed to calm the angered [[Zerg rush|proletarian masses]].
