This is a wiki so I will vandalize it, thanks.
Due to the fact that anyone can edit a [[wiki]], people feel a huge surge of unwarranted power. But the shine wears off as soon as soon as they notice that, to their dismay, [[Misterpoet|some people on teh internets do not like them]]. A lot of [[bitch]]ing, [[Emo|crying]], blanking and [[sock puppet]]s result.
