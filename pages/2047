Possibly one of the most dramatic little out there, '''Dark fox''' has caused much stress among the [[furry fandom]], most notably due to his extremely large [[unwarranted self-importance|inferiority complex]]. This leaves him to always be excessively [[emo]] and whiny whenever someone speaks to him. Dark fox is 17 and so this apparent [[Aspergers|ass burgers]] is quite possibly just a concentrated case of [[teen]] [[angst]].

Another reason why he's so emo is that he has no confidence in his work and himself. Due to his lack of confidence, he bitches and moans about the artists better than him; he even comes up with utter bullshit like "[[unwarranted self-importance|all the artists better than me make fun of me]]", which obviously isn't true because no one wants to communicate with him in the first place.

On several occasions he has caused much e-drama between several other members of the fandom. In his own little world there is something called the "[[Tom Cruise|circle of celebfurs]]" or something like that in which only the most popular furries [[yiff|communicate amongst themselves]], and not anyone else who is a "[[gay|normal fur]]" as he puts it.

A solution to Dark fox's problem would be to just [[an hero|disappear off the face of the earth]]. He is nothing but a parasite; the lowest scum of the furry fandom. Infact, he beats himself up so much it's ''almost'' cruel for others to do so.

He has decided to become [[an hero]], as noted in this message.

==[[Arbchat]]==
On July 16th, 2007, an [[Arbchat]] was held after [[User:ZeroUser|Crimson]] decided he would be accomplishing something by [[blanking]] this article. The arbchat ultimately went nowhere, and ended up giving birth to a new [[meme]], *facepaws*. The transcript can be viewed [[Darkfox/Arbchat|here]].

Since my life doesn't matter anymore to anyone, im going to Iraq once i build up muscle and graduate high school. Even though tarah , liel, and you all hate me, id still fight in the war to know that even they dont like me, i still like them, and i would literally die for them. Hopefully nobody will miss me when i leave. Its only a matter of who wants me to go and who will do the useless of keeping me here. Id go with what everyone wants me to do...}}<br/>

Frankly your life will always matter to your friends. I would prefer you not to go to iraq unless it is what you really want to do. I don't hate you but you pushed a button of mine that few are brave enough to do and it always ends the same way. Nothing will change until you learn to be you and really only care what you think. Stop letting others dictate your life and control your emotions. Your inferiority complex seems to know no bounds.}}<br/>

well if you all didn't hate me i wouldn't have the need to feel infirmity. Tarah just likes being the center of attention and loves to show off her status over everyone else. Its called Idealization of her is what im doing, as in im thinking shes a lot more than everyone else thinks. Though nobody will speak up and say shes realy self-centered (accordign to one of ur guys's pack) because she would do to them what she has done to me.}}<br/>

1. I don't hate you. Trust me if I hated you you would know.
2. No she doesn't she tries to avoid attention and thinks people that think she is a cleb fur are stupid. There is no such thing. She hates cliques and such
3. She does no such thing.
4. She isn't self-centered i don't know who is telling you this and frankly i don't care. If someone wants to be a coward and not tell her what they think to her face they are pathetic.
5. She has done nothing to you.}}<br/>

{{quote3|ok i can see 1.

but:

2. She does hate me because she does idolize herself and likes to make herself look better at the expense of making others look down. 

3. She has already, hard proof on that hate page.

4. There is such thing as status, hence comes popularity contest is all what the fandom has become. 

5. She is self centered because she didn't even care about wind. There is more that you don't know because she wouldn't tell you. Your gullable to her and she makes you think shes a nice sweet loving gal but in reality she isn't.

6. She has done a lot to me. Take for example my former friends, like u. She would not let any of you or anyone on her 450+ friend list befriend me, she wouldn't allow it. 

Not to mention this thing was supposed to be about liel from the start. He was just a wuss and ran off to the most popular fur to tell her. He knows that if she hated me the fandom would follow her in her footsteps. Theres a lot you cant see here. 

And maybe she should take her own advice when she says, For those who want to harrase other furs then grow up. 

She must really be occupied with liking me cause why else would she goto such troubles to destroy my life completely? this isn't just an online argument, shes turning friends against me that were eventually going to be my real friends. Also shes making it so i cant goto fur con since she knows hook-ups.

So yea think about that, and ill tell u what, ill apologize to Tarah if she promises to stop destroying me.}}<br/>

2. No she doesn't I don't know why you say that I am around her and the groups I know better

3. Yet you have no proof she did such a page

4. Well frankly I don't buy into that. There are plenty of people that aren't popular that are quite happy in the fandom.

5. I know everything that happpend between her and wind since i talked to them both. Wind is the one that broke up with her and there is a lot more too that. Before you go spouting rumors check your facts.

6. She doesn't care who befriends you. I befriend you and she didn't say a thing. Nor would she to anyone else. I don't know why you have this conspiracy in your head or where it came from but it is getting redundant and annoying.

No you are saying it is liel's fault she hates you. Yet earlier you said she corrupted everyone. She doesn't know anyone at cons she has never been to one. If you want to go to one go. She isn't doing anything to you. Please dark go to a therapist and get help.}}
