Get into the Loop
===Origin===

"Get into the Loop" is a failed [[meme]] that originated from the video by  {{youtube2|LaLupusLady|LaLupusLady}} in which the [[YTU|YoungTuber]], [[13 year old boy|Jesari]] asks [[you|people]] to 'get into the loop'. Sadly the little pre-pubescent [[faggot]] is [[Wapanese]], hence he cant do speaking good, so he  inadvertently asks people to [[doing it wrong|"Gedd inta thu loosp"]].

==[[Fail]]==

The message conveyed in the original video was intended to bring attention to the [[disease]] Lulpus ([[Aids]] 2.0), but instead Jesse's [[Pedophiles|Fanboys]] came (literally) to the video to [[fap]] away, paying no attention to what comes out of his mouth, but rather [[CP|fantasizing]] to what might go in it. Now in a [[brb, church|desperate]] attempt to cover their asses, [[Irish282|said pedophiles]] have had to look up Lulpus on [[TOW|Wikipedia]] and pretend to be interested, which is why the video has 3 comments and [[over 9000]] views.

==Teh [[Meme]]==

Repeatedly saying "IM IN THE LOOP!" or "GET INTO THE LOOP!" [[at least 100]] times  
is enough to annoy the [[Youtube Vigilantes]] and the [[YTU]], which  
makes 3 hours of [[Copypasta|CopyPastaring]] [[lie|worth it]]

==Lulpus?==

[[shit nobody cares about|From what one can gather from the video, Lulpus is a moar  
funny version of Aids, in which it too affects the immune system of sufferers, and  
probably leads to a hilarious painful death. The official name for it is Lupus, but for  
purposes of trolling, it are to be named LULPUS!!1]]
