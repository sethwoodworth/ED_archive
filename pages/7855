'''''Street Fighter 2''''' is a popular fighting game released in the 90's, showing what a fighting game could and should be. It was [[win|awesome]].

__TOC__

==History==
[[Image:Cammy.jpg|right|thumb|[[Asking for it]].]]
[[Image:Sf2introjaarl3pb.jpg|thumb|The classic intro.]]
''Street Fighter 2'' was the brainchild of some guy named [[Konami]]. Then, a boy named Capcom bullied Konami into giving the game to Capcom and Capcom took all the credit. Originally, it was called ''Street Fighter'', but [[no one]] cared so they added a 2 at the end. The objective of the game was to use [[Kung Fu]] on people of [[Racist|diverse races]] to defeat [[Hitler]]'s father at the end of the game.

Everyone orgasmed when the game was released to [[arcades]]. It was eighty cents a game, but not even worth it.

Due to the popularity, [[Capcom]] decided they could milk this cash cow. Instead of releasing a sequel, like normal companies would, they decided to release copies of the same game. It worked well.

Then SNK was like "Hey, lets copy Capcom and make a shit load of boring fighting games filled with [[fap]] material!", and so they did. Capcom found out about this, so to counter attack they released ''Street Fighter III: The Next Generation''. However, no one cared and still played ''Street Fighter 2''. Then came ''Street Fighter III: Street Fighter 2''. [[Wapanese]] fapped to the soundtrack in the back of arcades, but that's about it. Then after a massive amount of fan cum on their desk, Capcom stole SNK's stuff and made ''Street Fighter III: Pro Edition'' which poor ass [[Mexicans]] and [[Japanese]] play. It was a hit with the poor [[gangster]] types in America and is [[serious business]] in Japan.

And for all the [[animu]] fans, Capcom went to Squaresoft's doorstep, at first offering a partnership but in reality Capcom fooled Squaresoft into giving him all of his hentai DVDs. With these DVDs, Capcom created ''Street Fighter Alpha'', filled with animu style characters for animu fans. 

Stan Lee liked ''Street Fighter'', but he thought his comic book heroes could beat the shit out of ''Street Fighter'' characters. Thus began the ''Marvel Vs. Capcom'' series, pitting Stan Lee and his minions vs. Capcom, and gained [[borat|great success]] as Onslaught [[buttsecks|butt-raped]] a massive amount of Street Fighters, Mega Mans, and characters from several other series that no one gives a shit about. Then, ''[[Marvel vs Capcom 2]]'' was created, in which [[pikachu|Cable]], [[old|Magneto]], and [[MysteryBot|Sentinel]] [[hardcore|brutally]] [[rape|destroyed]] Capcom's legions at full force. It is considered "[[shit|the shit]]" by everyone in the arcade.

Later SNK was still [[butthurt]] from what Capcom did to them, so SNK challenged Capcom and thus began ''Capcom vs. SNK'', where SNK lost. Then came ''Capcom vs. SNK 2: The Rematch'' and ''Capcom vs. SNK 2: The Xbox Rematch'', SNK's strategy this time was to include [[gangbang|multiple girls]] that would make Capcom basement dwellers fap all over their controllers. The plan succeeded for the most part but poor ass Mexicans and serious Asians brought Capcom to victory. SNK, even [[moar]] butthurt than before, had one last shot, they invited Capcom over as a peace offering, but [[it's a trap]]! ''SNK vs. Capcom: Chaos Rumble'' started, Capcom was outnumbered and thoroughly bloodied, but not beaten. Then SNK called up his good pal ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh]]!'', and made three ''SNK vs. Capcom: Yu-Gi-Oh! [[faggotry|Card Battle Edition]]'' games, although the games were only liked by [[16 year old Japanese schoolgirl]]s, and only basement dwellers bought the game.  

''Street Fighter 2'' is still remembered to this day as having taken a huge chunk of your change and a small chunk of your life at the local arcade.

==Versions==
''Street Fighter 2'' was released for the [[SNES]], which pretty much sold the piece of shit.

The [[SNES]]'s best version was ''Street Fighter 2: Turbo Plus New Fallanges''. ''Super Street Fighter 2'' had new characters, but shittier music. While the Genesis version featured shittier music, it had [[ZOMG|mile a minute]] gameplay. And as we all know, [[lie|everyone plays ''Street Fighter'' solely for the music]].

==Characters==

===Street Fighter II===

'''[[Fyiad|Ryu]] -''' The main protagonist of the series, he is the most overused character [[evar]]. Most players who use him are [[faggots]] who stand in the corner and Hadouken constantly until the timer runs out.

'''[[USA|Ken Masters]] -''' [[Noobs]] use him because he's way [[Cool|cooler]] than Ryu, despite having the [[Copypasta|same exact]] movelist. He floods the Street Fighter IV servers with constant [[dragon]] [[Rape|punches]] and [[Dragonball Z|fireballs]].

'''[[Whore|Chun-Li]] -''' Players praise her for her [[Boobs|unique features]] not found in other characters. Nobody gave a shit about her until Street Fighter III, where she was the most overpowered character in the game. Street Fighter fans constantly [[masturbate]] to her [[Fatass|larger than life]] thighs.

'''[[Guile]] -''' The generic "[[American]] [[badass]]", he is the most constantly developed character in the entire series, with a [[Truth|grand total of 2 special moves in every single fucking game.]] In Street Fighter III, he decides to stop being a [[Family Guy|family man]] and turn [[emo]].

'''Blanka -''' Typical [[Brazil|Brazilian]] citizen with orange [[Dragonball Z|spiky hair]] and green skin. A favorite among [[furries]]. His special move is [[tentacle rape|electric rape]].

'''[[Pro ana|Dhalsim]] -''' Smelly [[Indian]] who sucks at fighting and gets the [[shit]] beat out of him by the rest of the cast. [[Noone]] uses him. [[EVAR]].

'''[[Fatass|E. Honda]] -''' Like Blanka, pressing [[Spam|PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH]] is the only way to win with him.

'''Zangief -''' [[Lie|The strongest character in the game,]] this [[IN SOVIET RUSSIA|Soviet]] [[son of a bitch]] doesn't [[fuck]] around. If you get too close, he will [[rape]] your ass on-spot. His special move is the SPD, or [[Drugs|Spinning]] [[Shit|Pile]] [[PC|Driver]]. He has no projectiles, long-range attacks, or, [[fuck]], any useful moves at all. Only [[azn|pros]] use him. Zangief is also impressed with the Russian president's ability to dance very well, which is the appropriate Russian fashion of celebration. He's also confirmed to be gay and had fucked bears in the past by Capcom. Nobody was surprised.

'''Sagat -''' Possibly the [[Thailand|cheapest]] [[motherfucker]] [[EVER]] in a fighting game, [[Tourneyfag|tourneyfags]] will bitch and complain if you choose him at a tournament. To win with him you just have to spam fireballs. He also has a strange obsession with [[fucking]] [[Furry|tigers]]. Nobody has defeated Sagat, and [[noone]] ever will!

'''M. Bison -''' [[Shit nobody cares about|Also known as Vega in Japan.]] He thinks seeing Street Fighters pummeled to dust is DELICIOUS! YEEESH! YEEESH! An effective technique to use while playing as Bison is spamming his Psycho Crusher attack. This will cause [[Guile]] to point towards the sky, with a jet of fire shooting behind him, and yell "BISONNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!1" Playing as Bison is a source of great [[lulz]], if only for his ability to shut down shitty fireball characters with a fucking [[awesome|headstomp]].

'''Balrog -''' [[Shit nobody cares about|Also known as M. Bison in Japan.]] Apparently Capcom thought people would confuse this black person with Mike Tyson, so they switched the names around. [[WTF|Actually looks pretty white]] in Street Fighter 2.

'''Vega -''' [[Shit nobody cares about|Also known as Balrog in Japan.]] A [[faggot|narcissist metrosexual]] [[USI|who is in love with himself]], he comes from Spain with a claw thing on his arm who uses "Spanish Ninjutsu". [[Doing it wrong|(Why did they need to switch not two, but THREE characters' names around?)]]

===Street Fighter Alpha===

'''[[Cock|Birdie]] -''' Was [[white]] in the original Street Fighter, but [[Capcom|Crapcock]] realized that all [[goth|metalhead]] bikers from [[England]] are [[black]], so they changed him. His special move is [[BDSM|chain whipping.]]

'''[[Slut|Rose]] -''' [[MILF]] from [[Italy]]. When encountered in single player mode, players lose to her on purpose just to see her [[Boobs|victory portrait]].

'''Adon -''' Sagat's [[bitch]], his goal in life is to [[fuck]] all the [[Atari|jaguars]] in the world. [[Noob|Sagat players]] pick him expecting to play exactly like Sagat, only to be [[pwned]] by some [[13 year old boy|8 year old]] who doesn't even know how to play the fucking game and just spams [[Mike Tyson|Balrog's]] headbutt.

'''[[Fail|Dan Hibiki]] -''' Obviously [[the best|the greatest character in the game]], he is like Ryu and Ken but more [[badass]]. [[Capcom|Capshit]] [[Irony|made him to make fun of SNK]] who constantly [[Copypasta|rip off]] everything that Capcom makes. Popular among [[fanfic]] [[loser|authors]] because he is [[Stupid|OMG SOOOOOO FUNNY! ^_^]]

'''<s>[[Black Jesus|Black]]</s> [[Satan|Evil]] Ryu -''' [[Original character|A palette swap of Ryu to make him gray and orange]]. Like [[white|normal]] Ryu, many players who use him are [[pussy|pussies]] because they keep spamming Hadoukens and [[Za warudo|then teleport to the other side of the screen]].

'''[[weaboo|Sodom]] -''' An American 'Weaboo Warrior' who has an amazingly huge fucking [[weaboo|hard-on]] for [[Japan|all things Nihon]].  Grand Supreme Douchebag extrordinare, he loves making you [[Family Guy|eat red carpet]] while [[buttsecks|he shoves a pointed metal pussy-creator in your chode]].  It's like someone took [[No More Heroes|Travis Touchdown]] and made him suck.  Has no visible [[penis|head]] under his [[V|mask]], and likely makes his money by acting as a portable double gloryhole for gay parties.

'''[[bubba|Cody]] =''' From <s>Street Fighter:1989</s> Final Fight. An Amerifag from [[faggot|new york]] who got screwed over by a trap and was sent to [[prison]]Basically, he got bored of getting raped by niggers and decided to break out of prison. His [[guy|friend]] is some ninjafag. Also wears pajamas and doesn't afraid of anything.

'''[[Guy|Guy]]''' - Also from Final Fight. And his name is really Guy, yes. Give him some credit, he was a ninjafag before the Naruto shit took over the interwebs. Apparently he and Rose [[sex|had a thing]] going on, even though he always chases after his fuck buddy Cody whenever he sees him.

===Street Fighter III===

'''Sean -''' The only [[gangsta]] in the entire series. [[Shit nobody cares about|Nobody gives a shit]] about him because he's just another [[original character|palette swap]] of Ryu. [[Fail|His super move is a regular Hadouken.]]

'''Twelve -''' Possibly the stupidest name for a character ever, he is a [[Russian]] experimental organism created to be the ultimate [[rape]] [[Internet hate machine|machine]], made of [[cum|white liquid]]. His attacks include [[tentacle rape]], spike rape, and being able to [[Transformers|transform into multiple weapons.]] His super move allows him to transform into the opponent character, but with a white palette. Because [[seriously]], that's what Street Fighter needs, more palette swap characters.

'''Hugo -''' [[Fatass|Hueg]] wrestler from [[Germany|Nazi Germany]]. His goal in the tournament is to [[Pwn|destroy]] Twelve, the evil [[Communist]] warrior from Russia. Nobody uses him in tournaments because [[lol|he suks lol]]! He is constantly followed by his [[transvestite]] boss. His special move is [[Extreme|in-air]] [[rape]].

'''Poison -''' A [[Transvestite|tranny]] with big [[Boobs|bewbs]] and pink hair. [[Admiral Ackbar|IT'S A TRAP!!!1]]

'''Q -''' Capcom decided they needed [[moar]] [[robots]] as well as [[Shit Nobody Cares About|plot ambiguity]] in the series so they threw in Q. Is he a robot? Is he black person [[Nobody Cares|NO ONE KNOWS]] and no one ever will because Capcom doesn't give a shit about [[you]]. Regardless, Q exhibits some winning qualities, namely his intro animation, which features him attempting to [[Falcon Punch|punch]] a group of fleeing [[children]] in the head.

'''Urien -''' A pallete-swap (Surprise!) of the final boss, who wears a [[gay|man-thong]] and nothing else.  His supermove is a magic mirror, which is [[crap|useless]] unless you've played the game over 9000 hours and are [[Japanese]]. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXMJ7UiLLFE He also gets emo and cuts himself if he loses by time-out].

'''Makoto -''' A Japanese [[dickgirl]] who uses karate and is a total lesbian. Her hands and feet are comically oversized, and look like they belong on a man twice her size. Makoto can fuck any girl she wants and frequently rapes the other Street Fighter women. Her supermove is a punch to the nuts, followed by several other punches to the face.

'''Dudley -''' [[Fag|Dainty]] English boxer with all the class. Dudley never takes off his boxing gloves and he enjoys drinking tea, did I mention he was a black person?

===Street Fighter IV===

'''Abel -''' A [[French]] fighter who has [[faggotry|forgotten his past]] and is looking for [[buttsex|answers]].  Could not exist IRL, for as we all know Frenchmen can't fight for [[shit]].  Supposedly the main character of the game, he is completely boring and forgettable in every aspect.  [[fail|Nice job, Capcom]].

'''Crimson Viper -''' A King of Fighters wannabe [[MILF]] with huge [[boobs]] and a [[vibrator|classified electric weapon]] on her hand.  Can also shoot fire out from between her legs.

'''Rufus -''' A truly American [[Fat|overweight]] tub of lard who looks ridiculous and has a very [[DO NOT WANT|animated gut]].  Has to take a break between each round to eat about a dozen [[McDonalds|Big Macs]].  His eternal rival is Ken Masters, because Capcom couldn't think of anything else to do with the fat [[shit]].

'''El Fuerte -''' Spanish for The Faggot, El Fuerte is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] cooking fighter.  Yes, you read that right.  His moves consist of running around the screen and landing on his opponent, in a poor attempt to mimick Vega.  He also has a combo called the [[Fisting|Fierce Fist Loop]].  [[No|IT'S SUPER DYNAMIC COOKING TIME!]]

'''Gouken -''' Ryu's [[Wisebeardman|bearded]] master.  He was presumed killed by Akuma, but in an amazingly bad retcon, he [[bullshit|magically comes back to life]]. Akuma and Gouken both want Ryu's hot ass, but only one will [[buttsex|claim the prize]].

'''Seth -''' [[Final Boss of the Internet|Villain]] of SF4. Besides looking like [[Watchmen|Dr. Manhattan]] with a yin-yang orb in his stomach, his moves consist of a mix of other fighters' moves. [[Sarcasm|How original.]] He will rape you in arcade mode. 

'''Juri -''' Apparently the main character of SSF4. [[OMG|Has a glowing left eye]] and [[Slut|likes to play with her opponents.]].  In the SSF4 animated film, she's godlike and can stop bullets with her glowing eye power, kick everyone else's ass and is pretty much invincible.  In-game, she's [[fail|completely useless and reguarly gets beat up by characters like Dan]].

'''[[Rapist|Hakan]]-''' The oiled up [[Terrorist|Turk]] of SSF4. He oils up his opponent until they [[DO NOT WANT|surrender]] making the guys long to be [[an hero|a hero]] and the girls want to [[fap|sweat]]. Also has the ability to [[LOLWUT|shit out his opponents with his oiled up body]]. Surprisingly a [[DO NOT WANT|good idea]] from Capcom. He also has a banging wife who is the ideal woman for any man because she doesn't talk back.

==Animation==
===Street Fighter: The Animated Series===
[[Image:Street Fighter 2.gif|thumb|A scene from the ''Street Fighter'' cartoon. [[wut|Those are Ryu and Ken]].]]

[[Image:Chun li nice.jpg|thumb|[[tits|OH YES]].]]

This came out shortly after the [[fail|first movie]]. It featured such faithful nods to the source material as [[LOL|Ryu losing]] to a distant cousin of [[nigger pig|Spider-Pig]] and [[wat|Ken defeating Akuma]]. Bison found this delicious. Also Ryu is the [[gay|WORLD'S STRONGEST PILLOW FIGHTER]], LOL.

===Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie===

[[tl;dr|This was the animated movie based on video games that made every other animated movie based on video games suck ass.]] It also ultimatly [[copycat|inspired]] [[Namco Bandai|other]] [[SNK Playmore|companies]] to do the same with such [[shit|classics]] such as Tekken: The Movie and Art of Fighting: Carate Edition. They did not age well.

===Street Fighter II: V===

Despite what the weeaboos say, this animated series has nothing to do with the animated Street Fighter movie. Which is a good thing.

===Street Fighter Alpha: The Movie===

What's that? You want another bad animated adaptation of Street Fighter? Because V wasn't enough? '''SURE YOU CAN'''!

===Street Fighter 2: Furry Edition===
[[crap|Cap]]com also made a [[furry]] version of ''Street Fighter 2'' known as ''Darkstalkers''. It had nothing but a bunch of fucking [[furry|furries]] as characters, and no one played it, except for the occasional [[weeaboo]] [[retard]]s.

==Trivia==
*Everyone knows Ryu's Hadouken maneuver. '''[[Humanity|Everyone.]]'''
*Expert archaeologists have found remains of ''Street Fighter'' arcade machines, thus proof that [[at least 100 years ago]] there was infact a ''Street Fighter'' game.
*''Street Fighter'' is the only game by Capcom with characters that aren't racially biased, especially not M. Bison ([[America]]'s Balrog; an obvious tribute to Mike Tyson), Fei Long (Chinese Bruce Lee type who screams like Michael Jackson), Dhalshim (curry-eating Indian) and Dee Jay (Jamaican breakdancing with dreadlocks while high on crippy reefer).
*<s>[[A winnar is you|Winner's]] don't use [[Drugs]].</s> Experts have determined that this is not true. Winners do use drugs, They just don't get caught.
*Sodomy/"Katana" was a [[weeaboo]] from the game with Haggar in it that crossed over into the ''Street Fighter 2'' universe, causing all [[IRL]] weeaboos to moisten their panties that they got from vending machines.
*Chun-Li's legs gets [[inflation|bigger and bigger]].

==[[Guile]]'s Theme Fits All==

While the Street Fighter series is rather notorious for having some sweet songs (see Blanka for details), [[Guile]]'s theme song received special attention in May of 2010.  The king finally grew old in the [[Youtube Poop]] kingdom, and thus the minimalist video editors needed something else to kill time with: enter Guile's Theme Fits All.  A Youtube profile by the name [[original|"Guilesthemefitsall"]] emerged in early May sporting the video that would spark a psuedo-phenomenon.  The lone video on this profile featured a scene from the [[Mario|Super Mario Bros.]] movie in which [[Mario]] takes a fall due to his obese nature and resulting inability to balance.  Suffice it to say, people saw this video and wanted more: more is exactly what they received.  Many different scenes synced with the epic synthesizer music have popped up on [[Youtube]] with the majority of them being posted in May.  This almost-meme has shown some promise, but lacks the hilarity to set itself apart from the other YTP phenomena.
