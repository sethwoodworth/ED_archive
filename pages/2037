Danny Williams

'''Danny Williams''' is the current premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, [[Canada]].  Canadians pride themselves on their supposedly grand national health care system, but Danny knows what's up.  In February, 2010, he spurned his fellow Canadians and their shoddy health care system and came to the United States to have surgery.  He also likes to club baby seals when he isn't enjoying hockey.

==Background==
[[File:Dannywilliams5.jpg|thumb|Dunderdale tries to stop the political bleeding.]]
At this time, Mr. Williams has not revealed any information concerning his medical needs except that it is an [[HNNNNNNGGGGG|"undisclosed heart surgery"]] of some sort.  However, Mr. Williams has made his distaste for the Canadian health care system abundantly clear by leaving his country behind and traveling to what many Canadians believe to be "the Evil Empire."  During the 12 week absence, Mr. Williams will have his job covered by the Deputy premier Kathy Dunderdale, who is also keeping mum about any medical issues.  She did, however, have this to say about the whole affair:

{{squote|He has gone to a [[House|renowned expert]] in the procedure that he needs to have done.  In consultation with his own doctors, he's decided to go that route.  It was never an option offered to him to have this procedure done in this province.  The premier has made a commitment that once he's through this procedure and he's well enough, he's going to talk about the whole process and share as much detail with you as he's comfortable to do at that time.|Let's hope he has his procedure finished before [[Obama]]'s [[Fail|health care package]] gets passed.}}

Mrs. Dunderdale goes on to say that she "doesn't know how the procedure will be paid for," and that "it will perhaps be done someplace in [[Florida]]."  It may be inferred that not only does Mr. Williams have a distaste for Canada's hospitals, he also has a distaste for Canada's cold weather.

==Canadian Reaction==

When this story first hit the media, the most common reaction was to state that "Mr. Williams plays a lot of hockey."

Most of his opponents and proponents realize that there is a huge political gaff going on and will side step the issue when questioned about the apparent defection to the United States.  Most quotes concerning the medical procedure are along the lines of "Get well soon!" and "Best Wishes!"  However, some noted Cardio-pulmonary experts have offered their opinions on the subject, including this slap in the fact to modern [[Communist|socialized medicine]]:

{{quote|He's a private citizen, who certainly has the right to choose where he wants to get the procedure done.|Dr. Robert Roberts, University of Ottawa Heart Institute president}}

{{quote|I would expect that he is eligible for all that the rest of us would be in terms of our own private insurance or government insurance and I'm sure if there's anything over and above that the premier will certainly take care of it himself.|So I guess that free health care isn't really free?}}

One Politico reader suggested that Williams, whose known for his often adversarial relationship with the federal Conservative government, was well aware of how the move might reflect on Ottawa.  "Danny Williams is known for trying to embarrass the Canadian government" seems to be the mantra at this point, along with the snide quip:  "The reason he’s going down south is because he can afford the $50,000 cost of getting surgery."  

However, all quips aside, it seems that it is the normal procedure for rich Canadians to leave their country to seek medical help in the United States.  Former Canadian Member of Parliament Belinda Stronach steadfastly opposed any privatization of Canadian health care while in office.  Yet in 2007, after being diagnosed with breast cancer, she effectively opted out of her beloved public system in order to have surgery in California. For poor slob Canadians, such tourism is out of the question.

Williams has shown no signs of slowing down or that he's considering retirement. On numerous occasions over the past several months, he has said he will run in the next election, which is scheduled for 2012, but it is not known which of the 50 states he will be running in.

In addition to hating Canadian Health Care, Mr. Williams also hates The Beatles and baby seals!  Watching liberals argue with Canadians is like watching two retards try to slap each other to death.  Watch at your own risk.
