Anontrack.org is now 7track.org. Again.

'''[http://7track.org 7track.org]''' is a torrent tracker established by [[7chan|7channers]] for the purpose of facilitating [[Piracy|file-sharing]] within [[Anonymous]].

==History==

In early 2008 a random [[7chan|7channer]] named Chris set up a shitty XBTT torrent tracker on his [[56k|home connection]] so other [[faggots|7channers]] could post [[Cp|torrents]] in 7chan's /pro/ board. Expected bandwidth demands were exceeded and [[fail|lag]] ensued. Chris found hosting with Jerrcs, who had earlier provided hosting for 7chan, and soon a [[Harlequin_Ichthyosis_Fetus|neonatal]] torrent tracker named 7track crawled, bloody and screaming, from the loins of 7chan's /pro/.

After a few months of routine torrenting and [[Circle_jerk|IRC loitering]] 7track experienced its first [[Anal_rape|obstacle]]. Although details are vague, general consensus is that Fubar leaked root login to a butthurt mod who proceeded to [[baleet]] the site from the internets. [[BAWW]] ensued, until a backup was restored and [[shit|business]] continued as normal.

For a short while some users at [[99chan]] set up an independent tracker named 99track, however this site never took off and 7track usurped its few active users.

[[Shit_noone_cares_about|In late 2008 7track upgraded its software to What.cd's Gazelle interface, making it one of the first private torrent trackers to use Gazelle.]] '''This, however couldn't contend with the fact that [[chan|*chan]] browsers are innately [[Downs_syndrome|retarded]] and [[Aspergers|antisocial]], and so 7track would never become a respectable torrent tracker.'''

Several months later staff decided to break away from 7chan and [[sex|service]] any and all anonymous, changing the site name to Anontrack. A few months after that other staff decided that Anontrack sounds like aids, so they changed the site back to 7track.

==Affiliations==

Since its inception, 7track has supplied its services to [[wutchan]] and [[7chan|7chan's]] Channel7 project, while also keeping close ties to staff in [[7chan]] and [[99chan]]
