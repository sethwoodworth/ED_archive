Twincest
{{merge|incest}}
[[Image:Twincest.jpg|thumb|Delicious twincest!]]

'''Twincest''' is a portmanteau of "twin" and "incest". For some retarded reason [[at least 100]] men and [[16 year old girl|yaoi fangirls]] have the disgusting fantasy of being with identical twins, this is fucking sick and wrong. Unless you're a [[sick fuck]], then it's okay.

==Fantards==
Most twincest fanart/fanfiction involves [[yaoi]] or [[yuri]] (but mostly yaoi), and fans of twincest are usually retarded [[fangirls]] with wet dreams of either [http://devils-lair.org/forum/ Dante and Vergil] or [http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3474889/1/ Mio and Mayu] raping each other. Twincest fanfiction is usually poorly written, but what more can you expect from a horny [[16 year old girl]] in need of a good REAL fuck?

==Random Facts==

[[Image:Twincestk.JPG|thumb|OMNOMNOM]]
* Fans of twincest usually never lose their virginity, mainly because nobody with a brain stem would want to go to bed with such a [[sick fuck]] who enjoys watches siblings screw each other.

* 90% of twincest fans lack in the vocabulary department, seeing that they can never post a comment without using "XD LOL HOT" or some kind of smilie '''in every sentence'''.

* In this [http://youtube.com/watch?v=CQXFZd951_I video]:  he creator states that it is not twincest yaoi in the least bit but some people can't seem to understand that and still comment with such as, "Goood. Mm twincest IS good, I think. Like it! )) " when the creators themselves says it is not yaoi. But, delusional as ever, they get pissy and flame them for being homophobic.

* Like [[yaoi]] fantards, twincest fans usually despise every female character that may be considered a love interest to one of the twins (unless said twins are women), and use the same excuse to justify their dislike towards them: "lol she just really annoys me and I never really liked her XD".

*5th of September is international twincest day, as first celebrated on 5th September 2010 by English television presenter, actress and writer Emma Kennedy.

* Twincest fans, usually ones in the Devil May Cry fandom, believe that it's okay to fuck your brother, but it is beyond terrible to fuck a girl who [http://devils-lair.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1325 resembles your mother]. See [http://www.aestheticism.com/visitors/gaming/devil_mc/index.htm this piece of shit walkthrough] for reference as well.

* Also in the ''Devil May Cry'' fandom, it's okay that the brothers fuck because they're demons (never mind that they're also half human and hate each other.)

* When confronted by non-twincest fans (IE: What exactly is hot about two siblings fucking?), twincest fans will usually respond with things such as:

{{quote|*shrug* differnt people find differnt stuff hot. i find twincest hot. XD im not saying you should like it. i was just commenting|YaoiFan1}}

* On the other hand, when praising twincest AMVs or fanart, comments will look something like this:

{{quote|Definitely the best Vergil/Dante vid I've ever seen! *_* I totally crazy about twincest xD and Vergil & Dante look so cute together ^__^ (no mention that I love play in "Devil May Cry" game series x3 and I can't wait to see DMC 4 ^^ ) Yey for Nelo xD

And yet they still wonder why we would embrace their genocide.

* Hikaru/Karou from ''[[Ouran High School Host Club]]'' (Which accounts for 110 out of 100 twincest fanarts)
* Len/Rin from [[Vocaloid]].
* Luke/Leia from [[Star Wars]]. But it's not yaoi, so [[shit no one cares about|it doesn't count]].
* Fred/George Weasley from ''[[Harry Potter]]''. You just know there someone is fapping off to Fred humping the new hole that Snape blew in George's ear and George never getting over Fred getting blowed up by... oh, noes, I gave away spoilers to Book Seven. Sorry. Should've avoided the Internet until you finished reading the book, retard.

== Twincestuous Videos ==

Just like every other fantard out there, there's about a million shitty [[AMV]]'s to go with their preferred twincest coupling. Go figure the first one that you find on a DMC twincest search has an Evanescence song to add to the shit factor.
