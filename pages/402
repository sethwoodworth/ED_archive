__NOTOC__

[[Image:Amazon.png|thumb|right|Unfortunately, there are no semi-nude amazons on this site.]]

Founded in [[1984]] by Jeff Bezos, [http://www.amazon.com '''Amazon.com'''] is one of the [[Internets]]' shittiest stores. They sell everything from [[porn|books]] to [[butt plug]]s. Amazon.com allows you to buy stuff with [[one click]]. 

It is where all [[16 year old girls]] post their [[wishlist]]s in order to facilitate people who want to buy them all the random [[crap]] they want when they [[camwhore|show their tits]]. It's also popular with people like [[Dave Eggers|this]], who [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/14/technology/14AMAZ.html?ex=1392094800&en=183dc1d16a0c7b4c&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND form a circle jerk with their pals and write glowing reviews of their own work].

The name of the site is a reference to Bezos's predilection for women who stand over twelve feet tall, dress in leopard skins (made from leopards approximately ten feet long), bear one tit each and brandish clubs.

==Amazon's user reviews==
[[Image:ipodreview_lolwut.png|thumb|[[Typical]] customer review of an [[Apple]] product.]]
Amazon allows registered customers who buy their shit to review their products. This was helpful until people like [[Gary Weiss]] decided to go out and make cavalcades of [[sock puppet]]s to bash all of their competitors and praise themselves. Amazon reviews are a popular tool for trolling. Posting fake reviews that bash items people like and praise things that people hate causes a lot of [[butthurt]] and [[lulz]].

Also, Amazon can never get a fucking order right. You order a book and they send you a [[chair]] - seriously, [[WTF]]!?!

==Wolf shirts==
[[Image:Amazon_wolfshirts.jpg|thumb|Each article is custom cumstained]]
Trouble finding a [[girlfriend]]? Buy yourself a fucking [[wolf]] shirt. Ever since [[ebaum]] scientifically proved the effect of these [[lie|beautiful shirts]], you can now have sex with [[2|at least two]] ladies who are not [[furries]]. Other wolf-moon shirts possess different powers of attraction: [[2girls1cup|2-wolves, 1 moon]], [[rapists|1-wolf moon]] and [[faggots|3 wolves, 2 moons]]. [http://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Three-Wolf-Short-Sleeve/dp/B002HJ377A Spend your fucking cash here.] [[DO IT FAGGOT]]

==eBay Amazon Warz==
At the end of January 2007, [[eBay]] fucked all of their loyal sellers and Amazon now looks more appealing in comparison because it offers free [[buttsecks]] whenever you sell something over $100. Amazon also doesn't force its sellers to use [[PayPal]], who will steal your money and hold it hostage for your social security number, which they'll sell to [[Mexican]]s.

==Shit for Sale ==
