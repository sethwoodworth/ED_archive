'''Wikia''' is the  for-[[profit]] tentacle of [[Jimbo Wales|Jimbo's]] [[TOW]] [[Cock|octopus]]. He uses it to make some cash on the side, mostly for [[hookers and blow]]. The whole reason for deletionism on Wikipedia is to feed this ad-ridden monster with some topics for Jimbo and [[Angela|Angie]] to get parasitic on and make more money. If it were not for deletionists [[Delete_fucking_everything|DELETING EVERYTHING]] fucking stupid things like [[Wookiepedia]] or Hot Wheels Wikia would not even exist.

It was originally founded by [[Jimbo|him]] (Wikipedia aka [[Wikimedia Foundation]] prez) and [[Angela Beesley|Angela Beastly]] (Wikipedia vice-prez at the time) as '''Wikicities''' (y'know, [[cyberspace]], an', like, y'got all these Wikicities floatin' roun' in cyberspace, an' people'll rilly wanna be in these Wikicities in cyberspace, join in, y'know, yeah, like, yeah, rilly suck em in!) in 2004. Super-sekrit market research on two or three [[wikipedophiles]] at [[Wikimania]] showed that people assumed Wikicities to be an information site for urban sex tourists. So Jimbo and Angie just cut four letters out of Wikipedia to emphasize the [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|brand association they were relying on]].

By 2006, a few people started to notice the [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|anomaly of a well-known non-profit foundation having the same president and vice-president]] as the [[fail| floundering]] and [[Incest|related]] for-profit they'd set up on the back of the same software and [[fucktard|volunteers]]. Over desperate [[Crybaby|wailing and teeth-gnashing from Wikipedoes]], they both tried to evade reality by stepping down, although Jimbo's chosen Wikipedia titles of '''Spiritual Leader''' and [[GTFO|'''Chairman Emeritus''']] heavily imply some kind of, aaaah, control? Angie also continued in gainful employment with the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] until the [[troll]]ing pushed her into a back seat.

[[Some argue]] that the view from the [[basement]] they get by using [[Wikipedia]] means that everything Jimbo does [[believe everything you read|should be trusted]]. This is pure bullshit, because Wikia makes a [[shitload]] of cash, with Wikipedia providing the free advertising.

[[Last Thursday]], Wikia forced all of it's [[wiki]]s to upgrade to the their new "skin", which basically means a huge [[advertising|advertisement]] jutting into the top of every page accompanied by a big [[fat]] Wikia [[shitty art|logo]]. This was done, they claim, at the behest of their [[Jews|venture capitalists]], but it drove [[over 9000|at least one]] of their most popular [[WikiFur|wikis]] away. 

Even better, the [[Jews]] at Wikia refused to set up a redirect without getting free advertising in exchange, and  [[GreenRaeper]] gained everyone's respect by absolutely refusing to go along with the crap. Furries may well be everybody's [[lolcow]]s, but they sure showed the way for Wikia wikis. Jimbo's thoughts on this loss of [[furfaggotry]] on his servers are unknown, but there's no doubt it caused a hissy fit.

== [[Search]] Engine Magnates ==
Jimmy and Angie made a bold play to become big [[search engine]] magnates off the backs of Wikia fucktards but [http://www.searchviews.com/index.php/archives/2008/01/wikia-search-launches-in-alpha-slammed-with-bad-reviews.php trod carefully] because they knew they had a [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest]] the size of [[John Holmes]]' [[dong]].

All turned out to be a [http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Search-Engines/Wikipedia-Founder-Jimmy-Wales-Declares-Wikia-Search-Dead-237514/ massive failure] but not before [[Jimbo]] had the chance to use it for date rape on [[Rachel Marsden]] (hey, I'll fly you to the moon on the Wikia-search jumbo jet if you just do [[buttsecks|that little thing]] for me).

== The Anus ==
[[Image:Black knot.JPG|thumb|Wikia Anus]]
At the beginning of 2008, Wikia announced the [http://annex.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page Anus]. This is described as "a place where Wikipedia [[fiction]] articles that are [[intelligent|too detailed for Wikipedia]] can be kept until they find a new home." The Anus has features like "Getting a Wikipedia Article into the [[Anus]]" and "Bringing Many Wikipedia Articles at Once". On Wikipedia, at WP:FICT, the use of this Wikia feature is suggested as a way to move articles out of Wikipedia: "Fictional material [[Truth|unsuited]] or too detailed for Wikipedia can be [[raped|transwikied]] to the appropriate Wikia, such as [[Final Fantasy]] Wikia and [[Wookieepedia]]. Other sites, such as Gaming Wiki, may also accept material. Transwikied material should be edited to meet the guidelines of [[Angela Beesley|specific wikias]]; do not just [[Original research|copy and paste]]. The Wikia Anus is a staging area for transwikied material and a place for [[non-notable]] fictional material that [[Homeless|does not have another home]]; the original Wikipedia versions will also be stored there.

According to John Doe, "This is a clear statement of affiliation between Wikia and Wikipedia. It explicitly establishes a mechanism by which Wikia directly benefits from its connection to Wikipedia. Enough of one to put Wikipedia's tax-exempt status at risk. When the same people are involved in the management of both a nonprofit and a profit making organization, US tax law prohibits the nonprofit from taking actions that directly benefit the profit-making organization. See IRS publication 1023, part V. --John Nagle (talk) 17:53, 1 January 2008 (UTC)"

Of course, if [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|you try to argue this conflict of interest on TOW]], you'll be accused of having your own conflicts of interest, plus making legal threats (which is forbidden) and being [[paranoid]]. Because you can't interfere with [[Jimbo Wales]]' bank accounts.

==[[Good article]]s in Wikia?==
There are some articles which are almost a little [[lulz]]y on Wikia sites. More typical is [http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica_%28Encyclopedia%29 this] unfunny [[patent nonsense]] on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], and [[Wackypedia]]'s [http://wackypedia.wikia.com/wiki/Grawp take] on [[Grawp]]. Most articles on Wikia sites are tragically unfunny, although a couple are useful if you don't want to read one of the [[crap]]py books the fans are on about (plot synopses of hated literature) or walked out on a shitty movie but still want to know how it ended.

==Wikia's new skin==
[[Last Thursday]], Wikia decided that the default Monaco skin used on all of their wikis wasn't bringing them enough in advertising revenue and decided to make a new skin called [http://community.wikia.com/wiki/User%20blog:Sannse/Your%20First%20Look%20at%20the%20New%20Wikia?showall=1#comm-249788 "Oasis"] (later renamed to the less [[awesome]] and less original "Wikia"). The new skin was supposedly "[[lies|made for the benefit of wiki readers]]", not the editors that slave over the wikis that make Wikia their money. In an effort to maximize Wikia's greed, the screen size was cut to a third of its former size to make room for [[over 9000]] ad spots and [[you]] cant't find anything you want because it's buried under a bunch of useless [[shit]]. Oh, and guess what, the new skin is ''mandatory'', meaning that individual wikis no longer have the option of deciding what their sites should look like to the random wiki viewer. Wikia users complained about how shitty the new skin is and how unworkable it is, but their complaints were ignored by the corporate overlords at Wikia. Several wikis hosted by Wikia then told Wikia to fuck off and moved off the Wikia network. One such wiki was WoWWiki, one of the Wikia network's biggest (and most profitable, don't forget that!) wikis.

===Wikia singlehandedly ruins WoWWiki===
The collective editors at WoWWiki, despite being [[WoW]] playing [[nerds]], were fed up with Wikia's bullshit and decided to [[GTFO]] as soon as possible. Wikia cried buckets over this, as [[some argue]] that WoWWiki is their biggest moneymaker. While the WoW nerds [http://www.wowwiki.com/index.php?title=Forum:Should_WoWWiki_leave_Wikia%3F&t=20101029043842 were discussing the new forced skin] and the effects of it on their beloved wiki, [[Bureaucratic fuck|Sannse]] came in and started patronizing them by being a condescending bitch plugging the Wikia party line. In a last ditch effort to get their biggest moneymaker not to leave the Wikia network, Sannse offered WoWWiki, ''and only WoWWiki'', a bigger screen size for their shit skin. [http://community.wikia.com/index.php?title=Forum:Main_Page_looks_great_in_Oasis_due_to_lack_of_sidebars#WoWwiki_may_get_wider_content_space The other Wikia wikis] viewed this as a slap in the face it was, pissing off even more people and driving more wikis away. The nerds at WoWWiki were not impressed by the bribe and jumped ship ASAP, forming a fork at wowpedia.org. The name change is because Wikia, being a bunch of spiteful [[asshole]]s, refused to sell the WoWWiki.com back to its rightful owners and still intends to profit from the now-all-but-abandoned Wikia version.

A few days after all the nerds left the sinking ship, [http://www.wowwiki.com/index.php?title=Forum:Future_of_WoWWiki&t=20101027172800 some random dude] from Wikia no one had ever seen before [[A challenger appears|appeared]] on the ruins of WoWWiki, trying to bribe the remaining populace with prizes in order to get people to stay. In a separate thread a few days after, [http://www.wowwiki.com/Forum:Next_steps_for_WoWWiki#Admin_rights Sannse declared] that she would be ruling over what remains of WoWWiki despite the former admins still having retained their admin rights. Around the same time, two nerds got into an edit war over the content of the Wowpedia article on WoWWiki. Pjc, an admin who had moved to Wowpedia but still had admin status at WoWWiki, defused the situation by locking the page. Sannse, still being a pissy bitch over the fact that 90% of the editors abandoned WoWWiki in favor of the new fork, decided to desysop him and all of the other active admins except one personally appointed by Wikia. [[Yes]], [[fail|she desysopped him for doing his job and decided to desysop the rest of the active admins out of spite]]. So now, WoWWiki currently has no admins to speak of, and is free to vandalize and troll. [[Stupid|The implication of this probably hasn't hit Sannse yet]].
