[[Image:Uscgdate.jpg|thumb|Typical US Coast Guard HERO something Douglas will never be.]]
'''Douglas Payne''' is a [[Pedobear|pedophile]] who currently [[basement dweller|lives in his parent's basement]].  He hangs out on [[Meebo]] chat looking for [[13-year-old boy| 13 year old]] [[No girls on the internet| girls]] to pick up so he can fulfill his [[pedophile| sexual fantasies]].  He is stupid enough to think that a [[13 year old girl]] would be interested in him and <s>is</s> was joining the [[Military| Coast Guard]] (until anon ruined his dreams) so he can hang out with a bunch of [[Homosexuality| fags]], [[Fellatio| suck a bunch of cocks]], and try to drown [[Cuban Missile Crisis| Cubans]] who are swimming into the country in hopes of shitty wages and/or perpetrating moar [[terrorist]] attacks in collaboration with the [[Jews]].  [[Some argue]] Doug may be a full-on member of [[NAMBLA]] as well.

Doug thoroughly enjoys sending naked pictures of himself to [[16-year-old girl| little girls]] as well as video clips of himself [[Masturbation| jerking off]] (detailed below).  He has further given out his [[Cell phone| phone number]] for multiple [[lulz]], which will be in great supply until he goes [[emo]] and [[Cutting| cuts]] it off.

If it’s not [[Common knowledge| obvious]] in the email chain, his email address refers to his [[fetish|fantasy]] of someday being known as "Douglas L. Payne, US Coast Guard."  

If we're lucky, Doug may become [[an hero]] after reading this.

You can see his [[MySpace]], which has moar personal information 
<s>[http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=262476750 here]</s>. Lulz deleted.

Upon reading this article, Doug developed a [[conspiracy theory]] that rivals the [[9/11]] [[Truther|Truth movement]] in its stupidity. Doug claims that an ED hacker took over his computer with a virus, stole all the information off his hard drive, and then created fake emails back and forth. The ED [[Hackers on steroids|hacker]] also hacked into his cellular phone and stole pictures and movies off of that as well. Doug went on to claim that the 13 year old girl's computer was also hacked, and that he has contacted the real 13 old girl and informed her of this. This in spite of the fact that she doesn't actually exist, and was not based on any real person; basically making his theory double as an admittance of his guilt. 

'''UPDATE''': He was arrested by the Fairfax County Police on 9/16/08 for contributing to the delinquency of a minor and for possession of a computer used in child pornography.  [http://www.fairfaxunderground.com/cgi-bin/arrestsearch.cgi?field1=Payne&field2=Douglas&field3=&field4=&field5=&field6=&field7=&field8=&field9=&field10=&field11=&submit=search source]. He was found guilty and sentenced on 11/12/08 and is currently [[Buttsecks|receiving help]] from [[Bubba|trained professionals]].

The [[chat]] log below has been edited down for maximum lulz effect.  You can see how easy it is to fool a [[man| grown man]] by using [[Grammar Nazi| poor grammar]] and [[Spellcheck| terrible spelling]]. “guest1911” is Doug, and the grown man impersonating a 13 year old for lulz is “cuteypie93.”

Except that it's always so cold getting out :o(  I think I'm looking forward to a hot shower because for some reason my shoulders are really tight, I'm hoping the hot water well help me relax.'''Unless you want to come over and try to give me a massage.  :o)'''  What else are you up to this evening?

'''It's too bad I don't live close to you cause then I could just show you in person.  If I went to your house, and you were there alone, I would walk up to you and start kissing you.  I would hold you close to me and run my hands all over your body.  I would lightly push you up against a wall and start to kiss your neck, maybe slide my hands up inside your shirt.  Then I would start to undress you and take off all your clothes.  You would then undress me.  I would start to kiss you all over your body.  Starting at your neck, and kiss down to your chest.  I would kiss your boobs and suck on your nipples.  Then I would kiss down a little further till I got to your belly button.  I would then pick you and lay you down on your bed, spreading your legs open.  I would start kissing at your belly button again, but start working down lower until i'm kissing your pussy.  I would kiss it and suck it, and slide my fingers inside of it until you start moaning because it feels so good.  Then we could switch, and you could start kissing me, and work your way down my body until you're sucking my penis.  You would keep sucking it until I cum.  A lot of girls like to swallow it, some just like the guy to shoot his cum on her face or on her boobs.  Now we could go far enough to where  actually have sex.  I could slide my penis inside your pussy and fuck you.  It feels so good, you would love it.  There's all kinds of cool different positions to have sex.  Then I could shoot my cum inside your pussy which feels sooo good for both of us.  
 
What do you think of that??  :o)  
 
<3 you sweetie!'''

Unfortunately I don't think next weekend is going to work.  Like I said that's the weekend I'm supposed to be moving out of my apartment, so it's gonna be pretty busy.  But I will try to come down a different weekend.'''I can't wait to hang out and for you to make dinner for me.  Have you told any of your friends about us having sex?  If so what do they think about it?  [[facepalm|If you have any other female friends who want to try having sex for the first time you can invite them over too]].'''  OMG I'm so tired, and I'm freezing cause I'm not wearing any clothes.  I'm gonna go get back in bed, but I'll talk to you more later today.  I'll take that video of me today too and send it to you.

'''What we can do when I come down, is we can have a threesome.  The three of us can all fuck each other at the same time.  Basically what we could do is you can lay down on the bed with your legs spread open.  I'll get on the bed and start fucking you, and at the same time, Julie can kinda sit on your face and you will suck her pussy.  Then we can switch.  I can lay on the bed, one of you can sit on my dick and "ride" me as they say, another way of fucking someone, and i'll suck the others pussy at the same time.'''  There's all kinds of cool things.  I'll send a video of a threesome so you can see what I mean.

Home alone till 5:00 huh?  Too bad I'm not there.  We could have some fun together.  I think you'll like the videos I sent you.  One of them is just two girls so you and Julie can try that stuff if you want.  And the others shows two girls and a guy, so you, me and Julie can try that stuff when I come down.'''It'll show you how girls suck other girls pussies, so you and Julie can try that.  And it'll also show you two how to suck a guys dick, which you two can try on me when I come down.'''  They're pretty good videos.  
 
I don't care too much for the Bucs, no offense.  I'm a diehard Redskins fan!!  :o)

Hey babe, I'm not mad at you.  Sorry I haven't responded sooner.  I've just been very busy with moving the last couple days.  But I think I'll have everything done by tomorrow.  So I'll have a lot more time after that.  But no I'm not mad at you at all.  You're the sweetest girl I know there's no way I could be mad at you.  Your Disney trip sounded awesome.  I'm very jealous, which I could go.  I can't wait to see you.  I'm still not sure when I'll be able to come down cause money for me is really tight right now.  But I will soon, I promise.'''I can't wait to hang out with you and talk and you can make me dinner like you said, and I'll do the dishes causae who ever cooks shouldn't have to clean.  Then after that we can cuddle for a bit and talk.  Then I'll get you up to your room and take off all your clothes, get you in bed and slide my dick inside that nice pussy of yours and fuck you soo hard.  I can't wait to cum inside of you.  And Julie can come over so I can have sex with her too.'''  I'm so excited!!  :o)  
 
<3 you!

Hey babe, how're you doing?  I just got to my parents house after moving all day.'''I got everything all moved out and into my parents house.'''  I'm so tired now though.  I might go out in a little bit but not for very long, I'm definitely going to bed early tonight.  What do you have planned for this weekend?  I have to start getting stuff ready for Coast Guard boot camp.  There's a whole list of things I have to get before I go.  I'm still gonna try to get down there to see you before I go.  I'll let you know.  Talk to you again soon.  Have a great night sweetie.

Hey sweetie, how're you?  I hope you had a good day at school.  I'm not doing anything right now.'''I've just been sitting here thinking about how much I can't wait to have sex with you and Julie.  Have you two done anything else together lately?  Is she still excited about me fucking her?  I wish I could take off all of your clothes right now, and lay you down on my bed, spread your legs open and slide my hard dick deep inside your pussy.  And I'll keep sliding it in and out, harder and faster until my dick explodes and shoots my cum inside you.  I'm so hard now I think I'm going to jerk off.  I'll take a video of it for you and send it to you in a minute.  Hope you enjoy!'''

MMM nice baby.'''Will you two lick each others pussies in front of me?  That would be so hot.  And it might hurt a little at first, because you've never had sex before, and since you're still really young and a lot smaller then me, your pussy is going to be very tight.  So it'll hurt a little getting my big dick in there at first, but once I start to fuck you, your pussy will lossen up a bit and it'll start to feel soo good.  Esspecially when I cum inside you, you're gonna love that it's gonna feel soo good.  I'm still stroking my dick now, wish it was inside you.  Do you want me to take a video of me cumming?'''
 
Love ya!  <3

Hey babe, yea when you take a camera or roll of film in to get them developed they can see your pictures.'''And I’m afraid I might get in trouble for having pictures of naked minors.'''  So, if Julie can get a poloroid camera that spits out the pictures when you take them, that would be perfect.  Then you can just send me the pictures.'''You can take some pictures of each of you, and then some of both of you doing stuff to each other.  And sure, I’d love some of your panties.  Julie can send me some of hers too.''' 
 
You can send the package to my house.  Send it to...

Doug,
 
You are a sick individual.  I have watched you over the past month attempt to solicit this girl and get sexual satisfaction from talking to a 13 year old.  The bottom line is, you were being lead on, and not only do I have email evidence, I have your nude pictures (that show your face), your cell, your home address (which luckily happens to be your parents address), and videos of you masterbating[sic]. 
 
Everything has been posted on the internet.  The videos will be up tonight, but your pictures, phone number, and address can be seen.  You will probably start recieving[sic] phone calls tonight, and your parents will definitely get mail. 
 
Additionally, I will be submitting all of your information to the US Coast Guard and attempt to keep you out, since you are someone that should not be serving the public.  While I don't have enough evidence to have you put on the sex offenders list, this should be enough to make you miserable, especially once this gets indexed with google and any search of your name will pull this up.  How does it feel to know that potential employers will see your dick? 
 
Have a great day Doug, check yourself out at:<br>

okay, you got me.  i was never actually intending to meet her.  it was just talk to kill some boredom.  i said i would try to meet last weekend, obviously i didn't even make any attempt.  please, you definitely got my attention, i've learned my lesson.  we talked for a long time before it got into anything sexual.  it definitely went too far and i didn't know what i was doing.  i made a mistake.  and i swear you're the only person i've ever done this with.  please take the site down and i swear i'll never do this again.

Look Doug, I'm afraid it's not that simple.  

For one thing, I've noticed that your facebook has a couple of girls in High School on your friends list along with another girl in Tampa.  I'm afraid this looks like a lot more then just something you were doing to kill some time.   

You mean to tell me you sent naked pictures and made videos of yourself jerking off just to kill time?  You requested naked pictures of this girl and her friend just to kill time?  

I'm sorry Doug, contrary to your claim we did not talk for a long time before getting into any sexual talk.  Does telling this girl you'll protect her once you're in the coast guard ring a bell?  How about mentioning that you want to move to Florida once you saw her picture?  You were flirting with the girl from the minute you started speaking with her.  What about telling her you loved her, thats some serious shit to a 13 year old. 

What will Andrew think about this?  What about your parents?  What would have happened if this was a real girl?  You would have ruined her life.  You're a terrible person and you need therapy more then anything.  It's too late, you dug your own grave and now its time to pay the price for your actions. 

Cry more asshole.

After Doug's "I'm sorry and I'll never do it again" approach didn't work, Doug tried blaming [[hackers]], [[virus|virii]], and threatening [[legal action]], all of which of course are hilarious:
----
To Whom It May Concern, 
   
This is the first time I've had a chance to e-mail you today, since I have not been home since about 4:00 pm yesterday.  You and I have a few things we need to discuss.  First of all, all those e-mails that were sent to you, did not come from me.  Despite what you believe or don't believe, my computer has been hacked a couple of times in the last couple months.  My myspace page has been phished three times to the point of it being blocked and I was required to change my password on more then one occasion.  Whoever got into my computer got my password to everything and started using my e-mail.  I have two different e-mail address, and don't check this one regularly.  So who ever was using this e-mail started a conversation on Meebo pretending to be me, when I never use meebo.  I have instant messanger downloaded, why would I get on meebo?  

And as far as the e-mails go, the company I used to work for recently had a huge merger with another company.  I was sent on the road for eight weeks straight to travel around Virginia and help some of our new offices get set up.  It was such a hectic merger, I never got a lunch break much less get online everyday.  And being in a hotel every night, I did not have access to a computer.  So during the time the e-mails were going on I wasn't even in town and didn't have any computer access.  So he could've easily had all the conversations he wanted without my knowledge.  And even if I did get online at work, they have departments that track what sites we go on, I could get fired for going on chat rooms.  

Once I got back in town, came time to start the moving process back to my parents house.  I e-mailed a few people as to what was going on with my moving, so whoever was reading my e-mails on the other address probably read when I was finished moving.  My phone number and home address, was unfortunately on my facebook page but I thought I had it set for friends only.  So he could've gotten that info off of old e-mails as well.  The e-mail you got last night about me "learning my lesson" was not me either, and I have proof.  I was at the Washington Capitals game last night and didn't get home until well after 11:00 pm and didn't even get on my e-mail last night.  '''(([[PROTIP]]:That right there's an allegation, not proof.))'''  Then I had to leave early this morning and was out most of the day, I only heard of this because my siblings called me when they got the facebook messages from you.  

The first e-mail I've ever seen from you is the one I got this afternoon when I first got home in response to the "I've learned my lesson" e-mail.  So I gave them my passwords and it was I that told them to delete my pages and all my past e-mail to try to prevent anyone from getting more information.  After this e-mail is sent, this e-mail will be deleted as well.  As for those pictures and videos, yes, they're me, however I took those a while ago and they were meant '''for another girl that I liked''' who is almost my age.  He got on my e-mail, found those pictures, and used them to send to you.  This is not the first time I've been hacked like this.  Something similar but not to this extreme happened a couple years ago.  None of my friends believe your site, I've had friends IMing me all morning telling me that those e-mails don't even sound anything close to the way I talk.  Even people I've dated who I have talked dirty too before said that doesn't sound like me.  It's possible in opening junk mail a couple months ago I got a [[virus]].  <b>There are virus's that can send basically everything on my computer, pictures, e-mails, passwords, everything to whoever sent the virus. </b>

I'm having my computer checked as we speak.  Also, a friend of mine googled the e-mail addresses, and actually found the real Cyndipie or whatever her name is, and IMed her, and she told her that her information was also hacked about two months ago, and she was forced to change all of her stuff.  Bottom line, this was not me.  I have been a good standing citizen my whole life, I have a record that's clean as a whistle, I have never done anything like this before.  I may not be the sharpest pencil in the box, but I'm not stupid.  And for me to actually give someone permission to mail that kind of stuff to my parents house and take the chance of them finding it?  <b>My father is a police officer and I'm joining the military.</b>  Do you really think I'd be that dumb?  <b>You know as well as I do that computers get hacked all the time.</b>  And that's what happened here.  Whoever was sending you these e-mails was someone that was using my e-mail address and probably deleting the messages before I could see them.  I'm not sure if it's someone I know or not, but I will continue to do research of my own to try to find out, and in the mean time, you need to take down the sites that you have created about me, or I will be forced to come at you with [[legal action]]!  That is all. 

Sincerely, 

The real Doug Payne 


<i>The best part of course is when he claims to have found "the real Cyndipie," because of course there never has and never will be a real Cyndipie as she was a [[god|completely made up person]]. Though "You know as well as I do that <b>computers get hacked all the time</b>" is a close second on the lulz-o-meter.</i>

''Doug's information was submitted to the US Coast Guard.  Doug recently sent [[moar]] email after the fact in which he had the following to say:''

A recent email from <s>[http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=59429891 Doug's Sister, Erika]</s> (baleeted) was discovered.  Apparently, Doug told everyone his computer was [[hacker| hacked]] and used that as an explanation to his actions.

After receiving the Metainformation from the camera, she had this to say:

{{quote|you want to play that way? fine, my brother sent the emails, but not to a 14 year old girl, it was to a friend of his, who was over EIGHTEEN! second, that "email" that he sent to this supposed girl who he has been having this supposed relationship with, he wasn't home last night, so there was no way he could have sent that email, he was at a hockey game, with my younger brother and his girlfriend! and there are no computers, in a hockey arena.|Erika Payne}}


Moar of this developing story to come.

Its rumored that the hacker was tutored by [[Mike Sandy]] just finished [[Computer Science III]] with an 88/89.

== Doug's Father, Doug! ==

[[image:DougsDad.jpg|right|thumb|Doug's father, Doug, beat Doug Jr. with the paddle that is over his shoulder when he learned that his son is a pedophile.]]

Doug went to [[dad| daddy]] at some point and asked for help because he did not know what to do.  Daddy tried his best to help, but clearly [[Ted Stevens| does not have an understanding]] of how [[Computer| computers]], [[Cell Phone| cell phones]], and the [[internets]] work.

A brief Bio on his father taken from the W.T. Woodson Crew website

''Doug Payne received his introduction to crew at TC Williams High School in the mid 1970's.  He has always loved being on the water and has been a boater for many years, so he was delighted when his daughter, Erika, joined the Woodson Crew Team in 2002. It was through this affiliation that his interest in crew was renewed.  He was recruited to join the Woodson Coaching Staff by Coach Fitzgerald at the 2005 Stotesbury Regatta and then joined the Northern Virginia Rowing Club, with a little urging from Coach Fitzgerald.  When the Woodson adult 8 was formed in the summer of 2005 he signed on with them as well and rowed during the summer and into the fall of 2005.'' 
 
''When not on the water you will find Doug on his motorcycle, either at work with the Fairfax County Police Department or on his personal bike somewhere out in the mountains.  Doug has been a police officer for 25 years and after serving in several units within the department was assigned to the Motor Squad in the fall of 2000.  Besides his patrol duties on Motors, Doug also takes part on the Squads parade / demo team and international competition team.''

As such an outstanding member of the community, it hurt him very much in [[moar]] than one way to find out his son is a [[sick fuck]].  Since this has been posted, and most of Doug's personal information was posted to the internet before this "sting" took place, Doug Sr. realized he had no idea what his kids were doing and ordered them to "DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING" and call a [[Waaaambulance]] immediately.  Fortunately, we were able to find a picture of Doug Sr. as posted above, moar to come if we can find it.  His first course of action was to have his second son, Andrew Payne, remove his MySpace as well as his daughter, Erika's.  While we have no information on Andrew, we were able to find that bio and a picture of Doug.  He also had the W.T. Woodson Crew remove his picture and bio.  Nice try Doug, lol, google cache FTW!

Here are some emails that were sent when he tried to defend his son.  He is probably afraid of his reputation being ruined, sucks to be you Doug!

The emails below have not been edited for maximum word to lulz ratio.  Feel free to edit.

To: cyndipie93@gmail.com 

Douglas just called to inform me today that you not only plan on going ahead with contacting the Coast Guard, But that you have contacted the media as well.  After he saw your email earlier this week he contacted me and advised me of the problem. After discussing it with him I advised him not to go onto the IRC site, at least not right away. I have gone to the web page looking for contact information, an email or anything where we can get in touch with the administrators of the site without going through a public IRC chat forum. Personally I don't think that a public chat room is the place to discuss this, especially when we don't even know if we are actually talking to anyone that runs the web site.  There are other ways to deal with this other than going through a chat room. I have been in contact with a lawyer and we have an appointment for next week to discuss this.  While your intentions may be admirable, you are denying Douglas any due process of law. You have already tried and convicted him, posted his phone number, our address and my daughters picture to the Internet. While you intent may have been to cause Douglas as much embarrassment and harassment as possible it also endangers my daughter and the rest of my family.  And you don't know for sure that he is guilty of anything. It is quite possible that he is telling the truth. More bizarre things have happened than someone getting into another persons email and using it for their benefit or to harm that person. 
 
Now I do believe that Douglas was not the author of these emails, and not just because he is my son. I am not the type of father who has ever just automatically assumed that my children could do no wrong. There are reasons that I believe him based on dates and times of some of the emails that were sent where he was not available to send them. We don't know who did this but are trying to figure out where these emails came from. <b>I am contacting google to see if there is a way of tracking that information. </b>
 
I also advised him to refrain from contacting you since the email he had sent you advising that it wasn't him ended up on the web site with your own personal twist added to it. I regret that you took his lack of contact as an admission of guilt.  I would like to see what we can do about getting this information off of the Internet and to bring this situation to a close.  
 
Doug Payne Sr.

Due process of law?  lol e-court.

After someone tried to blank the site, he was accused of blanking the site himself, and had the following to say.

I personally don't know of anyone creating an account. I just spoke to Douglas and he did not do it either. It would have to have been one of his friends. I have been reading the site information and did see about deleting the post so I already knew that would only cause more problems. I have been reading up some on the IRC as well but I use the computer to check email and would be just as happy if I didn't have to do that.  I have started going through proper channels as I see them. I have contacted a detective within the police department to start an investigation, I have consulted with a lawyer who is setting up the polygraph, but I just have a hard time considering that going into a public chat room where we have already been told that we are going to be made fun of, not believed and that every attempt to clear this up would end up being posted back on the Internet as a mockery, as a proper channel. So far all the advise that I have received is to not do that. I will, however, see if I can find out who did that and tell them to stay out of it. Any help you can give me to identify the person would be appreciated.
----
[[Detective| Detectives]] are coming for ED, oh noes!

== Police Involvement == 
The following is what the police had to say regarding an investigation:

''Before we ever got to that point, we'd have to conduct a complete investigation before we could determine whether a crime was committed and, if so, where it was committed. Only then could we determine whether we should present the case to the prosecutor. That would mean that we'd have to know who you are, conduct an interview with you and obtain all of the evidence you have. That would involve, at a minimum, obtaining the originals of everything you have and conducting a forensic examination of your computer. Not only that, our policy mirrors nationally accepted standards in that it prohibits the use of non-law enforcement personal in an online "sting" of this nature. That would be an issue we'd have to face and I'm not sure we could get around that.''

It appears Doug was able to dodge a bullet on this one, as most people are not willing to reveal their identity to a person's whose father is a police officer.  That's just asking for [[butthurt]] from the police.

== Facebook ==

Despite never having attended college, Doug maintains a presence on [[Facebook]], where the vast majority of his listed friends are all high school age girls. Thanks to Facebook's amazing security and privacy features, anyone can create a fake account, say they live in Washington, DC, and get into Doug's network, giving full access to his profile. All of Doug's friends, including his 15 year old brother Andrew and 18 year old sister Erika, have been sent a link to this page and should be getting a full dose of Doug's [[penis]] any time now. This is expected to result in major lulz.

Doug also notes in his musical interests that "I'm a Christian, so I'm a sucker for Christian music too." It's good to know he has his values in place.

The following are some reactions to this article from Doug's Facebook "friends":

{{quote|wow..i went on a date with him. thats really scary thank you so much for telling me. hes always asking me to hang out alone. <b>[[almost_raped|you basically saved my life]]</b> so thanks whoever you are.|Jessica}}

Well Jessica, [[I don't roll that way|that's just how we roll here at ED]]... saving lives, one article at a time.

==He Refuses to take a lie detector test==

help you get you're side of the story up online. I wanted to ask if you're willing to take a 
lie detector test via Skype. I can call you on your cell.
Z: So what do you think?
Z: Please, at least respond with a yes or no instead of ignoring me.

   test.

== Possible Defense ==

Though Mr. Payne is too stupid to adequately defend himself in this matter, a possible explanation does exist for the Virginian's demonstrably false claim to have spoken with the non-existent CyndiePie93, whose non-existent computer was [[bullshit|allegedly]] hacked: if one evokes Robert Heinlein's [[Otakukin|"World as Myth"]] framework set forth in his latter novels - the concept that all "fictional" constructs actually come to exist in parallel dimensions simply by virtue of being conceived, and that such dimensions are just as "real" as our own, which itself is a work of "fiction" in some [[The Matrix|other dimension]] - then one may rightly say that CyndiePie93 does in fact exist in some sense, because she lives in our hearts, lol.

                                       '''TL;DR'''

The [[JEWS DID WTC|Jews did it]].

== New E-Mails ==

The cyndipie93@gmail.com account had been long abandoned and unused for various reasons.  However, if SomeGuy had not been a faggot, and been busting moar pedophiles, he would have seen the following emails in cyndipie93's inbox:

The first was from Currently Anonymous, who in all honesty, needs a lesson in the art of not being seen.  While his name says Currently Anonymous, he signed the email, "Anis Del Toro", and his email is "anisdeltoro@gmail.com".   Not anonymous anymoar.  His email says:

Hi -
I'm hoping you can help me out.  I'm staying anonymous until I truly understand this situation.
 
I came across some pictures that Doug sent my 16 year old sister, and some texts in her cell phone.  I've been incredibly upset about the situation - not only is his dad truly a cop in Fairfax County - but his dad is OUR dad's best friend.  Dougie was manipulative and incredibly inappropriate.  My sister was smart enough to recognize that it was something that made her feel incredibly uncomfortable, and backed away from - but who's to say that the next minor will be able to do the same?
 
I do have a meeting with a police officer counselor soon to find out my options of filing complaints, pressing charges, going to court, etc.  I've been trying to learn as much about him as possible, and then found out about the site on Encyclopedia Dramatica.  I'm VERY interested in hearing the backstory.  My other sister filled me in a little bit, that he was chatting with a 13 year old from Florida, but not only would I like to hear what you know, I'd like to know how exactly he is now in the United States Coast Guard, and no charges were filed!  Is his dad really hiding all of this?!
 
I'm also aware of a 15 year old up here that is in the same boat as my sister, and am hoping to talk to her older sister, but from what I hear, she won't be very cooperative either - like my sister, she just wants this "to go away."
 
This breaks my heart that this is happening, and I can't sleep at night knowing that I didn't do everything I could to make sure that he will never solicit a minor again.
 
I would really appreciate and and all insight you can offer.
 
Thanks - 
Anis Del Toro

The second email, was from a detective on the Fairfax County Police Department requesting contact in regards to the "Doug Payne Case."  It probably explains why he is on the sex offender list now.

Hope the Coast Guard is doing ya well Doug!
