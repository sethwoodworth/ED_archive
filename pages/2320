Dogcow

Those who are [[retarded|not in the know]] argue about whether the coolest and most wonderous thing [[Apple]] ever created was the [[Macintosh]], [[Mac OS X]], or [[U2]].  They are all wrong.  The greatest Apple invention ever was the '''dogcow''', and she was discovered in April 1989 by Mark Harlan.

Hidden in every Macintosh, prior to the introduction of [[Mac OS X]] was the dogcow.  All dogcows are females.  Male dogcows are known as "bulldogs". The particular dogcow that lives in Macintoshes is known as "Clarus". If you click on her, she will do a flip and either say "Moof!" or "fooM!"  It has been a favourite hobby of [[h4X0r]]s to go dogcow hunting.  In fact, many buy Classic Macs for this very purpose.

[[Microsoft]], in all its Apple jealousy, tried hiding the dogcow in their OS too.  This is why "dogcow" and "Moof!" are trademarked by Apple -- to preserve Clarus' virginity.

==Other Dogcows==
