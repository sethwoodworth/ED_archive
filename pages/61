One of the oldest operating systems on [[Earth]].

Already, there have been reports of [[A RAPE SPIDER|bugs]] and glitches in the system. [[Microsoft]] is currently working on a patch for 2006 and is expected to come out January 1, [[2007]].

Designated the International [[Asperger's]] Year ([[seriously]]) commemorating the [[100]]th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Hans Asperger, discoverer of Asperger's Syndrome. 

[[2006]] was a good year for drama.  [[Democrats]] won the House and the Senate, only to [http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/12/14/news/senate.php see their one seat majority die] of a [[heart attack]] before the [[VTEC_Just_Kicked_In_Yo|power kicked in yo]]. [[Loose Change]] creators released another batshit video, and all while the machine of [[IRL]] worked, drama was occurring all throughout the [[internets]], which we now know are [[Ted Stevens|a series of tubes]].

The most important thing to remember before reading this article is that [[Fred Bauder]] cannot practice law in Colorado due to soliciting a client's wife for prostitution.
