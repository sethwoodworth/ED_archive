Oracle Corporation

'''Oracle Corporation''' is a globe-spanning, company-consuming machine with an unquenchable appetite. Good software companies go in one end, and cash flows out the other. Poor, overpriced software is a byproduct of this produce. [[Bill Gates|Larry Ellison]] is Oracle's dictator-for-life. In 2010, Oracle officially replaced [[Micro$oft]] as the [[Linux|evil empire]]. Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and decided it destroy its legacy from the inside out.

==Dismantling Sun's fresh corpse==

===MySQL===
Drama erupted in 2009, when Oracle and Sun entered into discussion about acquisition. Although the [[United States]] quickly approved the deal, Oracle had a tougher time having the deal approved in [[Europe]]. Meanwhile, Monty Widenius, one of [[MySQL]]'s core founders, [[Ace Attorney|objected]]. He didn't want Oracle to their their dirty, little hands on his mind child. [http://www.helpmysql.org/ HelpMySQL] was created as a result. Unfortunately, the petition didn't work, so Widenius decided to create a MySQL fork called [[Butthurt|MariaDB]].

===Discontinuing OpenSolaris===
On August 13, 2010, an internal memo for Oracle's secret plans for OpenSolaris was leaked:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">All of Oracleâ€™s efforts on binary distributions of Solaris technology will be focused on Solaris 11. We will not release any other binary distributions, such as nightly or bi-weekly builds of Solaris binaries, or an OpenSolaris 2010.05 or later distribution. We will determine a simple, cost-effective means of getting enterprise users of prior OpenSolaris binary releases to migrate to S11 Express.</blockquote>

Oops. So that's why new test versions of OpenSolaris 2010 weren't released. We've been pondering about why [http://opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=130353 since July]. Oracle basically wants its hardcore fans to switch to the paid, closed version.

This led to the rise of Illumos Foundation and their OpenIndiana operating systems. Of course, Illumos is basically hurting the free software movement in the long run by creating a non-corporate competitor to [[Linux]].

===OpenOffice.org===
On September 28, 2010, some disgruntled OpenOffice.org developers formed The Document Foundation and created a new OpenOffice.org fork called LibreOffice. TDF extended an open hand toward Oracle, but Oracle would have none of that and told them to [[GTFO|resign]] from the company.
