Hi Arc.

Haha, you caught me, sorta :V
I didn't knew the host would give out my information.

I discussed with a few artists over AIM if there actually was a way to get e621.net down as many artists were unhappy and complained about having their artwork up there and you're doing the worst job ever as admin and you know it.

So we figured to give it a try to report the website for various things, I went for the loli, someone else went for the beast and another one went for something else etc.

Who would've thought it actually works? I thought they probably would -just- strip it off the site. It was some sort of experiment, and it was successfull.

I have nothing against a webarchieve like e621.net if it's run the proper way, which you didn't.
Maybe one day you will try on another one, and then you'll actually respect the wishes of the artists. There would've been nothing wrong with the whole thing if you wouldn't have acted like a douche on people who came to you asking politely to have their artwork removed. UnicornSpirit was polite, I've been polite, so has everyone else been.

The onle one you spoiled with the correct behaviour was Neogeen, and I hope you're not going to give her shit for that now, but I asked her what she wrote in her mail to you and found she wasn't more or less polite or gave any other reasons than anyone of us, and that you get picky about the level of internet stardom an artist has, which is pretty weak.

So yeah, I'm sorry I ruined e621.net for those who really liked it. Sorry to the fandom, not sorry to you.

You got what you deserved.


If I get flamed for this now or whatever, so it shall be. Does your world collapse from this? Mine doesn't. The art is still out there, exposure still can be get through fchan and alike.

So Arc, let it slide.
You can't always be the winner, and I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT ON THE INTERNET right? :>
