'''[[9/11|Rudy]] [[9/11|"9/11"]] [[9/11|Giuliani]]''' ([[9/11|more]] [[9/11|like]] [[Jews Did WTC|JEWliani]], [[9/11|amirite]]?) was a greaseball [[9/11|candidate]] for the [[9/11|2008 presidential election]] and the only [[9/11|politician worse than Dubya]]. He [[9/11|ruled]] with an [[9/11|iron fist]] as the [[9/11|Republican]] [[9/11|Godfather]] of [[9/11|New York]]. He [[9/11|gained]] [[9/11|fame]] [[9/11|taking down elements of the Mafia]], while his [[9/11|father]] and [[9/11|uncle]] were [[9/11|both]] [[9/11|made-men]]. He [[9/11|broke]] up with his [[9/11|second]] [[9/11|wife]] in a [[9/11|press]] [[9/11|conference]] but [[9/11|cheated]] on [[9/11|all]] of [[9/11|them]]. When he's not [[9/11|raping]] his [[9/11|wife]] or [[9/11|kids]] with a [[9/11|plunger]] he [[9/11|dresses]] in [[9/11|drag]] and [[9/11|pretends]] to be [[9/11|Ann Coulter]]. Oh did we mention [[9/11]]? NINE ELEVEN?  He was endorsed by Christfag [[Pat Robertson]] despite the fact that his personal life made [[Bill Clinton]] look like [[Jesus Christ]].  He went on to run the worst campaign in political history (yes even worse than [[Freddie Thompson]]).   

==NINE ELEVEN==
Despite his [[liberal|pro-abortion]], [[liberal|pro-gay-marriage]], [[liberal|pro-illegal immigration]], [[liberal|pro-gun control]] stance, "moderate" (read: [[Neocon|socially liberal Zionists]]) [[Republican]]s think he is the fucking savior of the GOP and that he will save them from the evil [[Hillary Clinton]], even if it means sacrificing their principles. This is because neocons do not actually care about issues such as [[abortion]] or Mexican; they only care about invading Middle Eastern countries and defending their Jewish fuckbuddies in [[Israel]] from those evil A-rabs.

==Giuliani and [[9/11]]==
Giuliani is one of the most corrupt [[asshole]]s to ever walk the face of the [[Earth]]. It was his fault that [[9/11]] occurred because he was too busy paying the [[JEWS DID WTC|''New York Post'' and the ''New York Times'']] more than 7 billion dollars each of mostly taxpayers' money to keep their mouths shut and call him Giuliani the hero and the leader who saved [[New York]] from 9/11; instead of bribing the two [[shit]]rags, Giuliani could have bought some sort of flying mechanism, such as a plane, to fight [[flame|fire]]s and keep them from spreading like they did on 9/11. Giuliani was also indirectly responsibly for the extensive damage. The [[WTC|towers]] fell because New York City did not have any planes that could drop anything on the building, whether that be water, or foam, or even firemen who could have been dropped on the roof instead of having to climb up multiple flights of stairs with heavy gear all while blocking the exit and keeping people from coming down the stairs because the firemen had to go up.

[[Image:Wtc 005.jpg|right|thumb|Remember, Giuliani was mayor when this happened. Are you remembering? Do you still remember now? How about now?]]

Since his campaign had no substance whatsoever and he really doesn't have anything of value to offer to America, instead Giuliani constantly referred to the fact that [[JEWS DID WTC|he was mayor of New York on 9/11]]. While he has yet to point to anything he actually [[JEWS DID WTC|<i>did</i>]] on 9/11 aside from stumble around in dust-covered confusion like the 8 million other people who also happened to be in New York on that day, the invocation of his "leadership" (i.e. yelling into a walkie-talkie with nobody on the other end and posing for [[Goatse|some very moving pictures]]) at the site of the attack apparently make him capable of running the country. 

He is also quite masterful at connecting ANYTHING to 9/11, including:

*[[Iraq]]
*Illegal [[Mexico|Wetbacks]]
*Gun Control 
*[[Drugs]]
*The [[Mafia]]
*[[Porn]]ography
*Education
*That time he cheated on his ex-wife while she was at home dying of cancer.
