A kind of camera angle used by [[emo|emos]], [[scene|scenesters]], [[fags]] or a mixture thereof to show that they're [[uber]] [[hawt]] just like everyone else, because they can hold the camera in one hand.
== How to Mirror Kiss ==
# Get into the mindset that you're [[unsexy|super sexy]], even if you're lying to yourself (that's alright, you do that ninety percent of the time anyways), and pile on all your [[poseur]] [[scenester]] makeup and jingly pink things.
# Find a big ole mirror. It has to cover, like, your wall. If you don't have one of these, you're screwed.
# Smack yourself in the face really hard. It's, uh, for that innocent stare you want when you're looking sideways at the camera.
# Repeat step 3. Again and again.
# If you're still concious, you might as well smash your $500 digital camera at this point because nobody wants to see any more of those [[retarded]] gay-ass [[hipster]] mirror-[[fetish]] poses littering the [[Interweb]].
# Repeat step 3.

A mirror kiss can be considered a pose or a camera angle, it doesn't matter since it's [[gay|ingredigay]]. They're used by scenesters to show off how cool they are to pull off a great feat like holding a camera in one hand and partially side-glancing it while still looking sexy. If you consider trying to devour your own reflection sexy. And it's used by weirdos obsessed with their own reflections. It's also used by [[emo]]s who can't use the timer function and are bored with just taking a picture of their reflection holding a camera. Fuck cameras-in-the-picture pictures. Those are out of style.

As a precaution, mirror kisses should NOT be used by anyone who is the least bit [[fat]], or [[ugly]], or [[scene]], or [[gay]], or just anybody. Don't take any of these pictures at all. I'm sick of seeing them on every [[MySpace]] in the history of ever. It's not original. It's not sexy. It just makes you look like a [[fucktard]] licking a mirror.
