'''The Dancing Baby''' (also called [[Gay|Baby Cha-Cha]]) is among the oldest and most famous of internet [[meme]]s, first popular in the late [[1990s]]. 

==History==
It was created as an early form of internet [[pedophilia]] arousing the cocks of many [[ODB|old men]] and [[hackers on steroids|haXX0rz]] alike. The world was in shock seeing a 3D baby dance as this technology was all shiny and new, the [[meme]] started around the same time Toy Story was released, the first 3D [[animu|animated]] movie made. The confusing new realism in l33t graphic technology raised questions like "[[Madeleine McCann|Where are that baby's parents?]]" and "[[DDR|How did that baby learn to dance?]]" from people not knowing the difference between [[IRL|real]] and [[religion|make-believe]].

==Cameo Appearances==
The [[baby]] was made internationally popular by a show called "Ally McBeal" as a hallucination by some [[Schizophrenic]] [[pro-ana|skeletor]] named Calista Flockhart. As nobody knew shit about the internets at the time, almost everyone assumed it was the [[Original Content|original idea]] of the writers and [[popular opinion|applauded]] their [[Todd Goldman|tremendous wit]]. 

The background music for said faggotry was "Ooga-Chaka" by a dance group called "Trubble" which subsequently hit #21 on the UK charts and did well in Australia.
