{{GreatestHits}}
To many average internet users who are not familiar with the fact that there are actual people behind the words typed out on the screen they are reading, Wikipedia is a valuable source of information that can be applied towards every day life.  Want a list of books to read?  Consult Wikipedia!  Need a recipe for chicken soup?  Well, I'll be damned, TOW has a page all about that stuff!  Where will the wonders ever cease?  

They cease right here, right on the pages of Encyclopedia Dramatica...where we showcase some of Wikipedia's Greatest Hits...and these hits usually involve that sites obscure, faulty, and even shocking content.  This article, small as it may seem, displays some of Wikipedia's Lists.  These lists really have no place on the internet, but for some reason, probably because Wikipedia is full of oddballs, fringe lunatics, and pedophiles, they have a home on the (naive and unaware) world's information crossroads.

==Found on List of animals with fraudulent diplomas==

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cats_with_fraudulent_diplomas

<small>EDiot's note - pretty much all of this page is lol enough to warrant an exact copy and paste...only the highlights are displayed here</small>

*Colby Nolan is a housecat who was awarded an MBA degree in 2004 by Trinity Southern University, a Dallas, Texas-based diploma mill, sparking a fraud lawsuit by the Pennsylvania attorney general's office.[1]

*Colby Nolan belongs to a deputy attorney general. In looking to expose Trinity Southern University for fraud, some undercover agents had the then six-year-old Colby Nolan obtain a bachelor's degree in business administration for $299. On the cat's application, the agents claimed that the cat had previously taken courses at a community college, worked at a fast-food restaurant, babysat, and maintained a newspaper route. Then the school informed Colby that, due to the job experience listed on his application, he was eligible for an executive MBA for $100 more. The agents then sent for Colby's transcript, which claimed that Nolan had a 3.5 grade point average.

*On December 11, 1967, The Times reported that Oliver Greenhalgh had been accepted as a Fellow of the English Association of Estate Agents and Valuers, after a payment of eleven guineas (his two references were not taken up). Oliver Greenhalgh was a cat belonging to Michael Greenhalgh, a cameraman with Television Wales and the West who were investigating bogus professional associations.

*In 1986, Rhode Island real estate appraiser Roy Schaeffer obtained a Certified Real Estate Appraiser (CREA) designation from the National Association of Real Estate Appraisers (NAREA) for his cat, Tobias F (for Feline) Schaeffer. He displayed his certification above his litter box. NAREA's fraud and defamation lawsuit was dismissed after two years of legal wrangling.

*It was alleged during a trial on drug charges that (John I.) Rocko, a police dog, had the same criminal justice degree from Concordia College and University as the local police chief in Fostoria, Ohio, John McGuire.

*Institutions that appear on this list are those that grant post-secondary academic degrees but are listed as unaccredited by a reliable source. Some of these institutions are no longer in operation.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gay,_lesbian_or_bisexual_people

<small>EDiot's note, who needs [[Craigslist]] when you have Wikipedia?  Also, this list is so large, it is broken down alphabetically and by image, almost like a menu, so that you can order up a soul mate in a much more easier fashion.</small>

*This is an incomplete list, which may never be able to satisfy certain standards for completion. You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced additions.
