A scandal is something with a high enough [[lulz]] and/or [[sick fuck]] factor that it is necessary to have a picture taken of yourself in front of it with [[Japan]]ese sign language eyebrows facing downwards.

SCANDAL! Alex LagacÃ© in front of  vomiting guy beside the Temple nightclub in trois-rivieres metropolis...

Scandals make up [[at least 100]]% of [[drama]] including [[Fox News]] and [[Tabloid]] rumours. It is almost impossible for a story to make the news if it is not a scandal.
