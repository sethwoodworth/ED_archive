<i>'''[[Chocolate Rain]]'''<br />
Some stay dry and others feel the pain<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
A baby born will die before the sin<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
The school books say it can't be here again<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
The prisons make you wonder where it went<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
Build a tent and say the world is dry<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Zoom the camera out and see the lie<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
Forecast to be falling yesterday<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Only in the past is what they say<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
Raised your neighborhood insurance rates<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Makes us happy livin' in a gate<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
Made me cross the street the other day<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Made you turn your head the other way<br />

(Chorus)<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
History quickly crashing through your veins<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Using you to fall back down again<br />
[Repeat]<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
Seldom mentioned on the radio<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
It's the fear your leaders call control<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
Worse than swearing worse than calling names<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Say it publicly and you're insane<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
No one wants to hear about it now<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Wish real hard it goes away somehow<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
Makes the best of friends begin to fight<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
But did they know each other in the light?<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
Every February washed away<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Stays behind as colors celebrate<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
The same crime has a higher price to pay<br />
chocolate Rain<br />
The judge and jury swear it's not the face<br />

(Chorus)

Chocolate Rain<br />
Dirty secrets of economy<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Turns that body into GDP<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
The bell curve blames the baby's DNA<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
But test scores are how much the parents make<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
Flippin' cars in France the other night<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Cleans the sewers out beneath Mumbai<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
'Cross the world and back it's all the same<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Angels cry and shake their heads in shame<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
Lifts the ark of paradise in sin<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Which part do you think you're livin' in?<br />

Chocolate Rain<br />
More than marchin' more than passing law<br />
Chocolate Rain<br />
Remake how we got to where we are</i>
