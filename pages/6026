Open relationship
Made famous by [[Facebook]], the term '''open relationship''' is used by [[rich and beautiful|shallow]] people in denial about their own [[whore]]ditude who need a sense of [[meaningless noise|emotional security]] while avoiding mutual exclusivity. Why? Well, because otherwise wouldn't be very [[Hippy|New Age]], now would it? [[You]] might think that since the word "relationship" is contained therein that some kind of commitment is implied. '''[[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|You are wrong]].''' 
The first and foremost response to criticism about the [[fail|typical wannabe-unique lifestyles]] of those in open relationships. is to [[Waaaambulance|BAWWW excessively]].

== Defining the Open Relationship ==
[[Image:Sartre.gif|thumb|right|This is Jean-Paul Sartre. He and his wife [[feminist|Simone de Beauvoir]] lived in an open relationship. He benefited the most from this agreement, as he could bang a female student that didn't mind that he [[basement-dweller|didn't change his underwear too often]].]]
The main thing that separates an open relationship from [[polyamory]] is essentially that fucking other people without your partner's consent isn't against [[The Game|the rules]]. An open relationship is often used by a man or woman when the man wants sex and can't get anything better or when the women doesn't want to be alone. This is often the case amongst [[16-year-old girls]] and any person of the male gender often, but not limited to anything else mentioned in the [[:Category:Sex|''Sex'' category]] on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]].
Open relationships become [[typical|common]] in [[college]] among [[BDSM|kinky sluts]] and kids who like to think they're [[attention whore|rebellious]]. The cause of this tend to relate to not only [[attention whore|low self-esteem]], but also excessive [[fapping]], lack of balls and [[AIDS|mental illnesses]]. These relationships always [[suicide|end badly]] and leave the formerly [[abuse]]d children to [[Self injury|slit their wrists]] while listening to [[Mindless self indulgence|Mindless Self Indulgence]] and masturbating to the latest leaked [[BME]] video.
