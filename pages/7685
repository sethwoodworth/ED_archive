Soraged

'''Soraged''', named for the faggot members who consider [[an hero | suicide]] each time their e-peen is threatened, is a [[shit | shitty]] [[forum]], made by [[Ron Paul | Ryan McAdams]], owner of [[Uogamers: hybrid | UOGamers]] and RunUO. Because [[fail]] [[troll | trolls]] couldn't stop [[flaming]] in the old [http://www.uogamers.com/forum/starbucks/ 'Starbucks'] (non-[[Ultima online | UO]] discussion) forum, he created a new forum where the [[fag | fags]] could flame as much as they want without any trolling skill. This is the generally accepted reason the already pathetic trolls there have grown fat and lazy, yet their e-peens are [[offended | actually shriveled up and dead.]]

Today, Soraged is mainly [[newfag | newfags]], shitty trolls, and other various forms of total [[asshole | assfucks]].

==The Now==
[[Image:Machine washable.jpg|thumb|'Machine_Washable', Official [[camwhore]] of Soraged]]

Soraged is now pathetically trolled by utter newfags daily, including Tribal which is the only thing keeping soraged alive and Symptom which should be on everyone's ignore list, ect. [[Internet_tough_guys | Tough guy]] [[Drama_queen| Cebrious Arcane]] is often emulated by [[13_year_old_boys | thirteen year old boys]]. Other members such as Caz and Sir Elton John provide [[lulz | lulzy]] and/or informative posts and threads to keep people interested in [[Shit_nobody_cares_about | important discussion]] on the forum. [[:Image:Machine washable.jpg | Machine Washable]], a [[proven|lie]] [[girl]], [[camwhores|camwhore]] and flirts with washed up [[wigger]] Hivajisa.

Very little keeps Soraged lulzy, and only [[drama]] (generally caused by [[13_year_old_boys | Black Thunder]]) brings any type of enjoyment to members of this [[shit | 'cesspool of internet faggotry'.]] When [[Relevant_to_my_interests | srs discussion]] happens, derailed threads produce [[lulz]].

Occasionally, a new person will come with [[Shit nobody cares about|interesting views,]] but this person is usually just [[Anonymous_pussy | an alt account]] of one of the [[gay]] members.

[[No_offense%2C_but... | In truth]], the forum is a whirlpool of of [[Internet_drama | trollability]]. Anyone [[stupid]] enough to pass up on a [[Lol_cow | lulz-farm]] like this, should immediately [[an hero]].

==The Truth==
A confession by [[fag | Tribal]], a yet [[fail]] [[troll]] from [[Australia | Taiwan]] or something.

{{quote| Soraged is supposed to be non-moderated, but there are a few, strict rules and whenever you defy one of these, Countessa will take action and do something unnecessary. Soraged is also full of faggotary thanks to me. Theres actually nothing happening in Soraged. It's just a bunch of boring yet tries-to-be-funny people who [[Ron Paul | Ryan]] wanted to [[rape | kick off his butt]] (Editor: What the fuck?) (his neat and elite [[Uogamers: hybrid | uogamers forums]]) and dump us somewhere else. I might've even played a part in this decision by annoying him in a political discussion. Oh well. |Tribal|}}

==Quotes==
{{quote| i always found you rather attractive kio      in a turkish kinda way |Caz|}}

{{quote| No one gets raped, you idiots. |Black Thunder|}}

{{quote| Some Nigerian prince emailed me and said if I wire him 10 grand, he'll repay me with 50 mil in less than a week. So I'll be rich soon. |Cebrious Arcane|}}

{{quote| Why stab me if I don't bleed |Punkers Slave|}}

{{quote| apparently you guys haven't lived through real intraweb funnies, fite or lulz. |Black Thunker|}}

==Fight Club==
The Fight Club is the main forum designated for [[flaming]]. Generally, the latest [[idiot]] on the bandwagon will be repeatedly called a [[faggot]] by [[Leeroy_Jenkins | 98.33333 (repeating, of course)]] percent of the population of Soraged. Of course, this produces very little [[lulz]], and the forum is almost entirely without massive drama anymore.

==Politics==
Ryan McAdams publicly supports [[Ron Paul | Pon Raul]], and put up a banner next to the main Soraged banner during the 2007-2008 campaign. Needless to say, there were many threads about Ron Paul, though any opportunities to produce lulz from the event were wasted on yet another series of fail attempts to be funny.

Though most attempts were wasted, the majority of the forum supports Ron Paul (mainly the members with an IQ over 80.) or does not support another candidate. Ron Paul banners are found in many signatures, as well as the occasional signature bashing another candidate [[for the lulz]].

Most intelligent members also believe the [[jews_did_wtc | TRUTH ABOUT 9/11]], [[Shit_no_one_cares_about | the war in Iraq,]] ect. [[Retarded]] trolls try to argue the other way just to produce lulz and drama, but only ridiculous and unfunny arguments are generally had as a result of these.

==Raid==
[[Image:Huwoahuh.gif|thumb|Unofficial multipurpose image of Soraged.]]

Despite calls for a raid from a bitter ex-member of Soraged, no action has been taken, which is understandable because [[Anonymous]] is [[X_is_not_your_personal_army | not your personal army, faggot]]. [[Anonymous]] should be aware that a raid against Soraged would have little to no effect, as any posts made in such an attempt would most likely be of a higher intellectual quality than those made by legitimate members.

Anonymous should know that [[cock]]-[[porn]] will, as always, be warmly received and would therefore useless as a weapon.

==Soraged Brain Trust==
Due to the increasing amount of [[faggotry]] occuring on the Soraged board, a [[lie | Trust was formed in order to keep the Soraged forums moving in a good direction.]] The founding members, Tribal (one of the most [[gay | avid]] users of soraged.com) and Terron (a washed up, old janitor who works in a prison) needed 3 more members in order to keep things on Soraged funny. This is where the 3 other councilmen came in. Flipper, Punkers Slave, and Top Notch (who apparently has a huge [[dick]] and huge [[clown]] pants).

This, of course, failed. [[The cancer that is killing /b/]] seems to have been surgically implanted in Soraged. This is what happens when you make a forum with nearly no rules. It is blatantly similar to mixing nitroglycerin and large quantities of burnt [[shit]] together and detonating.
