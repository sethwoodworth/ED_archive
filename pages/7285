'''School shootings''' are one of the greatest weapons in an [[IRL troll]]'s arsenal; causing a [[victim]] to shoot up the school is a prime example of [[List of ways to win at the internet|winning the internet.]]

While the participant is unleashing all of his teen angst on the faculty of his place of education, the benefits are not just solely for himself. 

The event not only creates [[HUEG]] amounts of [[IRL]] [[butthurt]] and shame, but much drama generating [[OL]] potential from relevant livejournals, blogs, myspaces, etc. 

Nearly every good school shooting ends with the assailant receiving massive [[troll's remorse]] and promptly becoming [[An hero]].

==History==

School shootings began in the [[Bayeux Tapestry|11th century AD]], when 16 year old Brenda Spencer of San Diego, USA, opened fire with a rifle on an elementary school across the street from her home, killing 2 adults (including the principal) and wounding 9 students. [[Police]] surrounded her home and waited for 7 hours until she gave herself up. When asked why she did it, Brenda replied, '''"I did it [[for the lulz]]."''' She also stated '''"I don't like Mondays."''' but later this was found to be directed towards Brenda's only clean pair of "days of the week underwear." Adding to the humorous impact of the event, she explained further. "The children were standing around like cows.  It was easy pickings."

Later that year, a pop band from [[Ireland]] called The [[U2|Boomtown Rats]] released a song called "I don't like Mondays." It was a #1 hit in more than 30 countries, but didn't do so well in the USA.

Since Brenda Spencer invented the school shooting in 1979 others throughout the 1980's and 1990's also partook in the [[IRL]] [[Trolling]] in their own special ways. But it wasn't until the year 199somethingorother when Reb and V revolutionized this school tradition by killing themselves after the [[Pwnage]] of [[Columbine]] High School. This meant that no more depressed [[Emo]] kids could simply just commit suicide to kill the pain, but now they could become [[an hero]] after an epic [[Pwnage]] of their fellow students.

[[Columbine]] gave way to a swath of [[theft|copy cats]], and as any [[dumb ass]] knows the copies are just not as good as the original. What followed Reb and V's [[Epic Win]] was a bunch of [[pussies]] using shit weapons, not high enough body counts and certainly no suicides, so nobody really gives a shit about them.

Fast forward to one of the 2000 years with the butt rape of [[Virginia Tech]] by Seung-Hui Cho culminating in the highest score ever awarded a player in this popular [[video game]].

[[Image:Wikibrenda.jpg|thumb|Actual quote from wikipedia's article on Brenda Spencer]]

==[[PROTIP|Style Tips]]==
*[[Modern Warfare 2|Remember, no Russian.]]
*Call 911 and pretend to be Yakov Smirnoff/play [[Rickroll]] or [[Interior Crocodile Alligator]] to clog the system.
*Plan your event to take place on [[An hero day|April 20th]].
*Make sure to bring a change of underwear, warm clothing and [[South Park|a towel]].
*Make a effort to suggest [[Russia|Russian]] involvment or a secondary shooter from the grassy knoll.  
*Leave the corpses in humourous sexually suggestive postions.
*Peform [[Necrophilia]] with said corpses.
*Bring a friend to share the fun.
*[[Shay|Smear fæces over everything]]. 
*Become [[an hero]].
*If you can't get motivated to start a school shooting, listen to Nine Inch Nails and play Counter Strike (1.6 or source, your preference) at the same time.
* Watch the movie ZARDOZ, and base your entire shooting rampage on that film. So when you attack your school "exterminating the [[Jocks|brutals]]" while wearing a red diaper, bandoleer and hooker boots screaming the "The Gun is Good, The Penis is Evil" at least we all can get a kick out of the lulz that will follow when the media bubble-heads try to make sense of it and blame a shitty 1974 Sean Connery movie for your rampage.
* Learn how to fucking aim, remember 3 shots center mass, or do the Mozambique Drill which is 2 to the chest 1 to the head.
* Better yet, do not use guns because that just gets all the anti-gun faggots crying, be a man and do what [[Timothy McVeigh]] did, you will get a higher kill count too.
*[[????]]
*[[Profit]]!!!

(And for Christ's sake, if you're planning a school shooting, don't talk about it on [[4chan]], like [[Trey Burba|this guy]] did. Half the fucking world saw it, and he got [[B&]] both OTI and IRL.)

==Inspirational Music==

Thinking about doing an [[an hero]]? Want some background noise to help whilst you [[headshot]] your school mates? [[Fat Larry's Band|The Bootown Rats]] are all you need:
