Fake editor
[[File:Fake_editor.jpg|thumb|A fake editor at a computer]]
In [[wiki]] encyclopedias some people add content.   Others do 10 reverts for every real edit.   Still others do 100% pure reverts&mdash;these are '''Fake editors'''.

On large wiki encyclopedias, these [[basement dweller]]s blend in, cleaning up [[vandalism]].   On smaller ones with no changes, they go stir-crazy, eventually reverting every new change ever made.  Perhaps they've decided that the wiki they are on is perfect and needs no changes. Thinking about their utter devotion to [[Wikipedia]] makes you [[lulz]] with joy!

==Making Fake Edits to build edit count==

'''[[PROTIP]]:''' Hit random article, then hit edit.   Find a sentence and click after a period.   Press space bar and save article.  Re-edit and do it again.   It's best to make all sentences have two spaces after them.   This kind of thing is invisible in edit changes summary, even if you're using [[Enhanced Recent Changes]], as well as in the article itself, but it builds up your edit count.   Perfect for those [[wikipedia]] [[sock puppet]]s and a fun way to get banned on a small wiki for spamming recent changes as there aren't many there so that shit gets noticed.  

==On Wikipedia==

If you've read about Wikipedia, you've heard how it sucks.  If you've read it, you've seen how it sucks.  But one can never comprehend why until they've suffered through editing it.  The reason of course, is trolls.

Now you've heard [[Wikipedia]] talk big about stopping trolls and [[Der Jimbo]] even gave a whole lecture on the subject, but the fact is that Wikipedia couldn't stop a troll if the fate of the entire [[Marcab Confederacy|Galaxy]] depended on it.  All Wikipedia manages to stop are people with legitimately opposing viewpoints who are angry (remember trolls make people angry, they do not get angry) and people who are simply [[comedian]]s.  Those two groups get a [[ban]] and Wikipedia considers it a [[:File:Mission-accomplished.jpg|victory]].

Fact is, most people who stay on Wikipedia are trolls, of the [[unfunny]] variety too.  Everyone else is driven off except a few [[crazy|mentally ill]] [[aspie]]s who are quite often male-to-female [[transexuals]].  The trolls on Wikipedia are people who go there not to improve the site, but do nothing but revert.  Nothing else.  If you look at recent changes there, that's all you find.  A person tries to improve the site and someone reverts them.  Never do these fake editors try to refine an addition, they only revert.  The only people who actually can get new content put in are [[Gary Weiss]] and his [[9000|6000]] [[sockpuppets]] combined with [[Isarig]]'s branch of the [[Jayjg|Zionist aliance of paid editors]].

And that is why Wikipedia sucks.
