The Chan Top List
__NOTOC__
[[Image:Chantoplist.png|thumb|Recognize any of them? Me neither.]]

'''The Chan Top List''' is a list of the Internet's best shit-imageboards. Larger chans such as [[4chan]], [[7chan]] or [[420chan]] are excluded. In lieu, some of the slowest websites on the Internet populate the list, including but not limited to: [http://www.infinitychan.co.nr/ Infinitychan] [[Bokuchan]], [[Konatachan]],[[List_of_*chan_boards#101chan|101chan]], [[List_of_*chan_boards#Maruchan|Maruchannel]] and [[List_of_*chan_boards#Junkuchan|Junkuchan]]. 
==Tracking==
The list calculated its members' ''unique hits'' daily (when it didn't delete all of the stats first) and thusly ranked the cooperative imageboards upon such. An imageboard's rank on the list was not only reflected on The Chan Top List, but also on the site-specific tracking badge (an image that goes onto the subscriber's website). Nevertheless, most chan operators are morons and you are practically guaranteed to find a thread on each site's /[[b]]/ exclaiming "CLICK THE LINK UP TOP SO WE CAN GET HIGHER ON TEH LIST". Suggesting that none of the subscribed [[admins]] paid any attention to what they signed up for.

==Latest Discussions==
Upon the left of the website there was a panel equipped with [[Lies|testimonials]] and general discussion per subscribed imageboard. [[IMG!]] was formerly listed, but when [[tahko]] became [[butthurt]] due to the vast majority of discussion topics centering around how he is a faggot and a [[spammer]], tahko straightaway withdrew [[IMG!]] from the listing. Not long after, Tahko rejoined chantoplist, upon realizing his membership was the only reason his site got any views at all. Since then however, he [[bawww]]ed like the little [[faggot]] he is and left it again, proving once and for all, him and his [[IMG!|shitty website]] are [[fail]].

More recent conversation topics included the ongoing ''who is cheating'' debacle, endless CP threads, and [[shit nobody cares about|something about a pixel board]].

==ED Joins The Chan Top List==
On August 31st, 2009, ED joined The Chan Top List. Within an hours time ED was up in the ranks pageview-wise of the #1 site ([[1024chan]]) on the list's pageview amount for the whole day. However the ranking is an average of the week, so ED didn't get the coveted top spot until it's second day as a member of the list. Boo hoo.
==Death and Rebirth==
Since the people they used for host had [[gay sex]] with the owner of another [[arab|company]], they [[rape|suspended]] The Chan Top List because the new [[faggot|homosexual]] doesn't allow [[shit no one cares about|"chan shit"]]. [[BAWW|BAWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!1111oneone]]
Since they found new hosting, everythig is back to normal, so gb2talking about [[cp]]
