Angst
[[Image:Angst.jpg|thumb|Angst]]

'''[[Angst]]''' (from the German word "Angst", which means "delicate shoestring") is an emotional state of mind, located somewhere in the [[USA|United States of Africa]].

Clinically speaking, [[angst]] is anxiety often accompanied by depression. This can usually be traced back to [[Concerned Mother|over protective parents]] who make their small-pussied children too weak to understand the real world. On the [[Internets]], however, angst comes in several varieties, as follows:

== Fanfiction "Angst" ==

In fanfiction, "angsting" is the general brooding, whining, pissing, and moaning of a character, usually related to unrequited wuv or their confusion regarding sudden, unexpected onset of rampant [[slashfic|homosexuality]]. Punctuated by florid prose and woe-is-me dialogue. 

A typical example of angst in fanfiction would read as follows:

''Mister Spock sat alone in his dark, lonely quarters, a look of anguish on his usually stoic Vulcan visage. When had he first developed these illogical feelings for the Captain, and why had he been so resistant to facing them until now?''

== Teenage "Angst" ==

Minus the "florid prose", teenage angst is very similar to fanfiction angst (see above), insofar as it involves quite a bit of brooding and whining. Symptoms also include [[Linkin Park|crawling in one's skin]]. Teenage angst can be triggered in much the same way as fanction angst, though it can also be caused by break-ups, [[lonely|feelings of isolation]] (read: "No one understands me!") and the occasional grounding by one's parents.

Teenage angst is most commonly associated with [[16_year_old_girls | sixteen year-old girls]], [[Attention Whore | attention whores]], [[goths]], trucker hat wearing [[hXc]] [[scene]] fags and the entire [[emo]] genre as a whole. It also results, seemingly on a daily basis, in many instances of [[cutting]], attempted [[suicide]]s and lots of bad [[poetry]] (much of which tends to get documented on [[LiveJournal]]).

== Richkid "Angst" ==

[[Image:ANGST.jpg|thumb|The only cure.]]

True to the theory that most emos are upper middle class, Richkid angst is a popular phenomenon. Rich kids will bitch about how bland their life is and how they have no real friends. They will decide to learn guitar, and make their parents pay $500 for one. After two weeks they will ditch it. Rich kids have little reason to care, because they can smoke all the drugs they want and their uptight lawyer parents will pay for every cent of it. That's the beauty. White trash never experience this angst, because they are too busy shooting cans in a trailerpark to worry about life.

'''NOTE:''' All of the aforementioned take it [[in the ass]]. That's what expensive private schools are for, aren't they?

==[[Geek]]boy "Angst"==

''Why do all the nice [[girl]]s hate ME, and run after the nasty bastards who will treat them badly?''

Mild-mannered, [[unsexy]] [[geek]]boys tear out their hair, wring their hands and ask this question of every [[girl]] they ever meet; the [[girl]] in the [[comic]] shop, all of their sister's friends, all of their [[mother]]'s friends, and most of all the one sad, pathetic [[girl]] who plays the neutral-good-cleric in their [[role-playing]] game. 

The answer is always the same, but small variations in different cultures.

YOU ARE [[Asspie|SOCIALLY AWKWARD]] YOU [[B|BASEMENT DWELLER]]

Many [[angst]]y [[geek]]boys can be found declaring their [[angst]] on the [[internets]], mainly on [[eljay]] but also [[MySpace]] (British angst can be found in [[:Image:negro_community.jpg|spades]] on [[The Student Room|TSR]]). One prime example, SexyTechMage [http://www.freehate.com/womensuck/index.html claims that all women show him only disdain and disrespect]. From this, he has deduced that all women must be evil. Is he [[insane]]? Is he a [[pedophile]]? Or just another [[special]] guy with [[Asperger's Syndrome]]?

== [[German]] Angst==
*[[Hitler|Die Angst ist das Befürchten möglichen Leidens und bezeichnet somit eine Empfindungs- und Verhaltenssituation aus Ungewissheit und Anspannung, die durch eine eingetretene oder erwartete Bedrohung (z.B. Schmerz, Verlust, Tod) hervorgerufen wird.]]

*[[shit nobody cares about|Directly translated in English, word by word: The Angst is the Fearing of possible suffering and bedraws therefor a reception - and behavioursituation out of uncertainty and strain, those by an entered or expected threat (e.g. pain, loss, death) ago.]]

[[fact|Many Germans suffer from angst because in Germany, you can't even take a shit in a public toilet without first forking over some Jew gold.]] (Yes, really. You have to pay to take a [[shit]] in Germany.) [[Some argue]] that this is owed to the fact that Germans are prone to frequent bouts of explosive [[diarrhea]] due to drinking excessive amounts of skunky [[beer]], but this remains unproven.
