Immortal
[[Image:Immortalgrouppic.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Noone]] can challenge them!]]
Immortal is a [[black metal]] band from [[Norway]], notable for the fact that they realize that they are not [[serious business]] and have thus used their popularity for the purpose of generating [[music]] and [[lulz]]. This is obvious in their photos and music videos which usually feature poses and actions so [[retard]]ed, only a fucking idiot could possibly take them seriously. Of course, being a Norwegian black metal band, they naturally sing about [[emo|winter, grimness, darkness and death]].

== Members ==

Abbath- Founding member, vocalist, guitarist and chief lulz pioneer. Featured in every photoshoot. Named after what he fears the most.

Horgh- Drummer, second in command and lulz generator.

[[Shit nobody cares about|Demonaz]] and [[Nobody|Apollyon]]- Who?

==Internet Popularity and Shoops==
Because of Immortal’s lulzy pics, [[photoshop]]ped versions of them have been circulating among the internets, to be used whenever a black metal fan becomes convinced that the music he listens to is [[serious business]].

Most shoops of Immortal come from two main pics, which are lulzy enough by themselves.

==Music Video==
[[Image:Immortal.gif|thumb|Call of the Wintermoon, being kvlt with a wizard hat]]

Their music video, Call of the Wintermoon, was uploaded to [[YouTube]] where it has garnered [[over 9000]] views and comments. It features the band performing various metal acts of grimness such as prancing through a green forest in broad daylight while wearing full black metal corpse paint, and spikes, and growling at the trees. However, Abbath decided that this was not lulzy enough and decided to force a man who was named Kolgrim (He's Kold AND Grim!) to wear a [[Bloodninja|wizard hat]] in order to exponentially increase the gayness level to [[divide by zero|infinity]].
