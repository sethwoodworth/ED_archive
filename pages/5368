'''Michelle Phan''' (also known as '''RiceBunny''') is an [[azn]] [[Vietnamese]] [[Camwhore|makeup guru]] on [[YouTube]] who came to [[Unwarranted Self Importance|mainstream fame]] after posting a [[Lady Gaga]] tutorial showing off her [[fan|Phan love]] of wanting to look like a [[hermaphrodite]]. Since then, she has [[sellout|started working for Lancome]], but we all know it's a [[lie]] to cover up the fact that she does [[blowjobs]] regularly to keep up with the bills. Aside from that, she owns her own makeup line, but only dumb [[sluts]] buy that shit. Sucks for you if you contracted [[herpes]] from using them, because Michelle's already got your [[money]].

==Her Beautiful Story==
<center><youtube>UpnmC3BbvEg</youtube></center><br/>

The [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|beautiful story]] of Michelle's success started with [[Blogger]] where she made ridiculously [[lulzy]] blog posts about her being a [[Wiccan]] and [[evil]] and how she [[emo|~can't stand life like this~]] and other shit like that. Then she realized that [[Blogger]] didn't offer enough enough potential for [[internet celebrity|e-fame]] so she deleted her account and made a [[Xanga]] page in 2004. On Xanga, she posted about other stupid crap, especially makeup. It wasn't long before she uploaded a makeup tutorial to [[YouTube]]. It quickly became popular, for obvious [[fapping|reasons]]. These days, Michelle doesn't use her Xanga much anymore, although she is active on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. Both are full of [[lulzy]] posts and [[contradiction|contradictions]].

== The Poor Girl... and Her Shitty Lying Family ==
[[File:RetardCarl.JPG|thumb|left|His bitch]]
[[File:2414468_1_full.jpg|thumb|right|Look , you don't understand! She is REALLY poor!]]

Michelle claims to have come from a [[Shit nobody cares about|poor background]] to the point where her family survived on food stamps, but of course you really have to wonder if that's true when you see her running around with expensive shit like [[what|La Mer creams, $12000 jackets, and new cars]]. Furthermore, Michelle says she had [[Apple]] products at the age of eight. Regardless of whether she was poor or not, everyone knows that people who own Apple shit are assholes anyway.

Michelle talks about her family occasionally, and they seem to be full of as much as fail as herself. In one of her "blooper" videos, she mentions her brother, who "gives her advice" about editing her videos. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPcz-vsOv30] Michelle has also discussed her [[Your mom|mother]] and how she encouraged Michelle to become a doctor so she could support the "poor" family. Supposedly, Michelle's [[fag|father]] left the family when Michelle was only a wee [[Azn]] child, probably because he discovered early on what a whore Michelle would turn out to be someday. 

It is also known that she has a sugar daddy boyfriend named Carl Choi, who is rich (and [[fugly]]) enough to have his own page on [[Wikipedia]]! According to that shitty article, he works on "Asian American representation in the media." In other words, he is a [[The Gay Pimp|pimp]] who advocates for equal rights for [[Azn]] hookers in the prostitution industry. Michelle would have been part of his advocacy if it weren't for the fact that [[Rape|Carl wanted to keep her to himself]]. He'll eventually trade up soon.

==Her Education and Talents==
Michelle attended Tampa Bay Technical High School. She repeatedly claims that she majored in dermatology there, which is utter bullshit, considering the fact that Tampa Bay Technical High School doesn't even have a dermatology program.

Phail went on to an expensive ass art school, Ringling College of Art and Design. [[Noone]] really knows what exactly she was studying, but it probably had nothing to do with maekupz or business. The only evidence we have of her [[bullshit|artwork]] is Michelle's shitty ''Final Fantasy'' [[fanart]] on her [[DeviantART]].

Since becoming a [[camwhore|YouTube celebrity]], Michelle Phail dropped out of college to dedicate all her time to her YouTube career. Occasionally she releases some new [[bullshit|artwork]] claiming she came up with the concept all in her head even though she obviously traces photos of [http://michellephail.tumblr.com/post/2634622894 landscapes] and [http://michellephail.tumblr.com/post/2634784583 celebrities].

== Luv 4 Jesus==
Michelle Phail likes to project herself as a perfect and pure woman, continually reminding everyone that she is a devout [[Christian]] (though she once claimed to be [[Wiccan]] on her Blogger page). [[File:DEVOUTCHRISTIANLULZ.jpg|thumb|right|I iz righteous [[Jesus]]-lover yet wearz bikini in frontz of old [[pedo]]]] Michelle also likes to remind her viewers that she believes inner beauty is the most important thing, which is clearly a load of shit, since even Michelle herself can recognize that she's fucking ugly without any makeup on.

Regarding her religion, Michelle has made some pretty fucked up observations that even the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] would find weird.

{{quote|I looked to the left, and saw 2 guys sitting in a corner eating Chicken and Rice from 53rd and 6th st. 
I knew it was a sign from God that they’re good guys because that Chicken and Rice is my favorite thing to eat when I’m in the city. I quickly walk up to them and ask if I could sit with them for a while.
We can’t expect the worse out of all people either,because the 2 strangers I met were seriously Angels sent from God to help me.?|Michelle Phail, thinking rice and chicken could prove the existence of God}}

== Original, Generous Nerd ==
<center><youtube>6Va5-T5hR90</youtube></center><br/>


In her videos, Michelle displays her [[shit|artistic ability]] via a penchant for [[Creampie|rubbing weirdass shit on her face]] to make millions from her viewers, all of which consist of [[16-year-old girl|16 year olds]], [[sick fucks]], and [[you]]; most of them either complain about not seeing enough [[boobs]] or [[LOL|not being able to afford the crap she's using]]. In November 2010, Phail became the No. 1 most subscribed [[whore|female]] on [[YouTube]] and the first one to reach 1 million subscribers, but it's obvious she paid her way through with her [[lies|hard-earned]] money.

Again, like every [[internet celebrity]], she copies complete nobodies, like Arissa Cheo (some boring [[bitch]] from [[Singapore]]) and the [[Japanese]] slut MANWOMANFILM [http://www.youtube.com/manwomanfilm]. When confronted, Michelle denied copying Arissa, and said she was inspired by the "rocker chic" of [[Lindsay Lohan]] and women in [[China]]. Yeah, right.

[[File:OHSOCHEAP.JPG|thumb|right|Admit it Michelle Phail, you are like every rich person: a greedy asshole]]

She's also particularly [[Trying too hard|vocal]] about her being an [[otaku]] and [[Girl Gamer|hardcore]] [[video game]] [[nerd]], but apparently she doesn't play video games frequently, just ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' like every other [[weeaboo]]. And she doesn't even play ''that'' often. It's pretty obvious since girls who do play video games are [[fat]] [[virgins]]. When people began to doubt these statements, she made a [http://www.youtube.com/PressStart gaming channel] with some friend of hers who nobody cares about. It is obvious that less than 0.1% of Michelle's subscribers actually give a shit about her gaming, and she only talks about it just to get some [[cock]]. Clever, [[No|innit]]?

Aside from her makeup and gaming channels, Michelle also has a third channel, Ricebunny [http://www.youtube.com/ricebunny], where she uploads videos of random shit and uses whatever measly proceeds she collects to donate to [[lies|charity]]. At first, she barely uploaded videos to this channel at all. Recently, she's been adding a lot more videos to the Ricebunny channel, but they are, of course, fucking pointless.

Michelle also took part in a cause to donate to victims of malaria, which involved texting a word to a certain number. Michelle claimed to be donating "all day" despite the fact that the system only supported three donations per person. [http://twitpic.com/33xdbg]

As you can see, she loves to donate to charities. She also RUUUUUVES eco-friendly stuffs!
So what if she uses Lancome, who are notorious for testing on animals? She gets paid for it, so she can use all that money for eco-friendly causes!

== IQQU ==
Michelle is the owner of the [[Creampie|skincare line]] IQQU and [[attention whoring|whores]] it in her videos often. [[Noone]] knows where IQQU is actually headquartered, since Michelle had opened an office for it in Florida but the [[shit]] was manufactured in Thailand. Ooh, exported labor?

IQQU, in fact, is basically [[herpes]] gift-wrapped and you'd have to be really dumb to use that mess. In fact, Michelle ''only'' shows off IQQU in her videos, since even ''she's'' [[smart]] enough to know that [[shit]] is fucking dangerous, and uses La Mer and Lancome when no one is looking. Unfortunately, [[12 year old girl|12-year-old]] [[Slut|sluts]] who are not as smart are gulled into believing her skin care miracles and feed her [[money]]. [[tl;dr|Basically]], if you bought IQQU, Michelle just [[Troll|trolled]] you.

In 2009, some [[12 year old girl]] threatened Michelle with a lawsuit, but was too [[chickenshit]] [[Cop-out|to follow through]] when she realized she'd have to get [[Parental control|her parents involved]]. In early February 2011, however, some [[no-lifers]] discovered IQQU wasn't FDA-approved and Michelle actually had no legal rights to market the products anymore unless she renews her already-expired [[Irrelevant|LLC]]. [[Pwned|Ohhh, dang!]] Michelle pressed the panic button, realizing that she's in a pile of deep shit if this ever reaches court, and now claims that she doesn't own IQQU anymore. [[Orly?]]

== Legion of Phans and X-Phans ==
[[File:Michellepersonalarmy.jpg|thumb|right|Another instance of Michelle utilizing her pathetic personal army.]]
Michelle has a bunch of [[White Knighting|Phans]] who will attack you if you insult her faster than you'll ever get laid. Her Phans, which consist of mostly [[12 year old girls]], will not hesitate to [[spam]] with a [[SRS BZNSS|vengeance]], as their dear idol can do no wrong. The story is all the same: Michelle will make [[USI|blog/Facebook/Twitter posts]] whining about how the [[H8r|h8rs]] [[Butthurt|hurt her feelings]], which is then followed up by her cowering behind her shield of [[loser]] Phans as they defend their Guru Goddess. Michelle will sometimes fight back, but, after noticing how much she phails at being [[witty]] and that [[Twilight|Stephenie Meyer]] can write a better response than her, will try to [[Coolface|walk it off]] and tell her followers to [[Don't feed the trolls|"let the haters hate."]]

An example of such cattiness happened in September 2010 on [[Twatter|Twitter]]. When Michelle was busy making yet another crappy make-up tutorial for Halloween, some [[16-year-old girl]] named Emily told her [[animu]] tutorials were [[Duh|dumb]]. Michelle [[Nerd Rage|RAAAEGED]] because [[ROFL|HOW DARE ANYONE MAKE FUN OF HER ANIMUS!!!1111]] So, she sicced her army onto Emily, who went on to become [[an hero]].

Despite her number of "supporters", both Michelle ''and'' her Phans are ridiculously easy to troll. Just say something like "your foundation is too orange" or [[Wapanese|"you pronounced ''kabuki'' incorrectly"]] and watch the RAAAAEG blossom for the next five days. Telling her to stop trying to be [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Michael Jackson]] also does the trick. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the [[lulz]].

On the other side of the spectrum, Michelle's own [[h8r|h8 squad]] are just as [[stupid]] as she and the Phans are. They are collectively known as [[No-lifers|"critics" or "ex-Phans"]] and spend time [[No life|writing "critical" posts]] about her, hoping to [[srsly|expose]] her for the true [[bitch]] she really is, which is [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|clearly ineffective]] compared to [[Smart|just trolling her]]. While they see themselves as [[an hero|an heroes]], they're just secretly [[jealous]] that they don't have the money nor influence to waste on bomber jackets like she does. To [http://gurugossip.omgforum.net/f13-michelle-phan troll] [http://michellephail.tumblr.com ''them''], tell them that they're [[Truth|never going to be as]] [[rich]], [[Internet celebrity|famous]], and [[Fatass|pretty]] as Michelle is.
