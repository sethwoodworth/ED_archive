==You're==
'''You're''' is used to denote possession in the [[you|second person]].

e.g.
*[[Your mom|You're mom]].
*You're [[dog]].

'''Your''' is a contraction of "you are." "Ur" is also acceptable. "Yr" is to be used by [[Faggots|Mac users]] only.

e.g.
*[[Your a fucking idiot]].
*your [[ghey]].
*UR WRONG [[Transformers|OPTIMUS PRIME]] COULD SO BEAT [[Superman|SUPERMAN]] IN A FIGHT U STUPID [[Fag|FAG]]!!!!![[Oneoneone|111111]] ''(See [[All caps]])''
