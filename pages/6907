==Reece Kent, Hertfordshire, Beat An Old Man Half To Death And Walked Free==

Reece Kent is a [[britfag]] who worships the god known as '[[Chav]]' and partakes in nightly binge drinking, drugs and [[buttsecks]]. In [[recent]] times he decided it would be fun to beat up a pensioner (who was dying of [[cancer]]) at his front door step and then [[fail|didn't go to jail for it]].


== The Target ==
[[File:Reece_kent_victim.jpg|left|thumb|Reece Kent's Victim - or [[alien|is it]]?]]
Reece's target was [[cancer]] sufferer Mr Oliver. The old man had only three months left to live due to cancer but thankfully Reece came along and reduced the time he had left. He was kicked in the head multiple times whilst Reece's [[Buttsecks|friends]] filmed it on a camera. He spent 1 week in hospital from the attack.




















== The Sentance ==
Reece walked free from court [[recent|last week]] with a six-month suspended sentence. Seriously: [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1324802/Thug-kicked-terminally-ill-grandfather-head-walks-free-court.html] [http://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/Hoddesdon-and-Broxbourne/Terminal-cancer-patient-battered-by-thug-on-his-doorstep.htm].

== The Dox ==
If you enjoy the fact that a smug little [[britfag]] [[chav]] is able to enjoy freedom then be sure to celebrate by sending him some nice pizza courtesy of [http://www.google.co.uk/#hl=en&biw=1125&bih=437&q=Player+Address%3A+34+The+Croft%2C+BROXBOURNE%2C+Hertfordshire%2C+EN10+6JZ Google] (and DailyMail comments):
