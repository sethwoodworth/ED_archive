::''Not to be confused with [[deviantART]].''

'''Art''' is something that was invented [[at least 100]] years ago by Michelangelo, Leonardo De Caprio, and two other mutant [[ninja]] turtles. They developed the [[art]] to celebrate their obsession with the [[naked]] male form, or in other terms to cover up their immense gayness. Since its inception, art has diversified, and there are a wide range of [[art]] movements representing various subcultures (e.g. [[furry]] art).

Lots of [[people]] claim they don't know much about '''art''' but they know what they like. What they like is often not actually '''art''', it's [[retart]].

People also like to think they are being mildly [[intellectual]] by asking the [[circular logic|agonizingly stale question]] (generally in response to pieces from the lazily named eras of postmodernism and antimodernism), "is it art?" A few possible answers to this: 

*If you must ask, it probably isn't. 
*[[Shitty art|Of course.]]

==Artists==
A person who participates and engages in art as a profession, often attending [[Art school]], is an '''artist''' (often known more commonly by other terms such as '''art [[fag]]''', '''[[poor]]''', and '''[[unemployed]]'''). Artists are also often [[hipster]]s, [[goth]]s, [[emo]]s, and [[indiefucks]], which no doubt adds even further incentive for giving them a swift kick in the crotch if ever encountering them [[IRL]]. 

The less talented the artist, the more protective of the art he/she/it is. Most artists have huge egos and actually think their art will gain them notoriety for '[[USI|asking the really important questions]]'. The reality is that for most artists the 'really important question' is "Do you want fries with that?", which they can expect to ask for a great many years while waiting for their '[[Unrealistic expectations|big break]]'.

[[You]] can spot an art fag off the street if he has any of the following qualities:
* Listens to The Smiths
* Likes [[Mat Vaassen]]
* Has a [[Hitler|mustache]]
* Wears a [[Matrix|trenchcoat]]
* Has a mustache
* Wears black tights
*[[I has a bucket|Has a bucket]]
* Writes [[poetry]]
* Wears black lipstick (under his mustache)
* Has a roller coaster haircut dyed black
* Real hair color is actually brown (just like his mustache)
* Wants to be Robert Smith (but with a mustache)
* Has a mustache

(A lot of [[Anal Cunt]] fans wish they were Seth Putnam, and [[fap]] about [[Fellatio|sucking his]] small, [[virgin]] cock)
