Lopunny
__NOTOC__
{{notice|Voluntary exposure to this article may turn you into a [[furry]]. Please [[Jesus|resist the temptation]].}}
[[Image:LopunnyMiniIconCrop.gif]] '''Lopunny''', referred to by [[Japanophile]]s as ''[[moonspeak|ミミロップ]]'' and known by [[furfag]]s as ''SlutBuni'', is the [[69]]th Pokémon and is the female counterpart to [[Lucario]]. It is commonly known as an [[Angry Homo Kid|extremely cautious]] Pokémon, that [[Masturbation|cloaks its body]] with its fluffy ear fur when it senses [[rape|danger]]. Though she is not as well recognized as the more popular [[Gardevoir]], she remains a focal point of many pokéfags' [[beastiality|sexual fantasies]] and [[lie|stories]], because everyone totally wants to fuck something that's [[midget|3'11"]].

==Characteristics==

[[Image:Lopunnynaturalstate.PNG|frameless|right]]
She has the appearance of a [[bipolar|bipedal]] rabbit, [[goatse|loosely]] designed off of [[Playboy]] [[furry|bunnygirls]]; keep in mind that this is a character in a video game supposedly targeted towards ''children''. She is very well known for her [[eHarmony|breedability]] with other Pokémon; her vast range of compatibility makes her one of the most useful [[dildo|tools]] for [[rape|breeding]], seconded only to [[Ditto]]. Her known abilities are ''[[kawaii|Cute Charm]]'' (making her [[slut|irresistible]] to her opponents [[BDSM|when attacked]]) and ''[[fail|Klutz]]'' (making [[Fellatio|various]] [[Masturbation|forms]] of [[Cunnilingus|sexual foreplay]] near impossible). [[Some argue]] that this [[Pokémon]] is just one in the same as all the other Pokemon, these people of course are [[correct|wrong]].

She can be obtained either through [[hax]] or by evolving a female Buneary; most trainers preferring the [[science|evolutionary]] method as it pertains to [[shit nobody cares about|evolution through happiness]], defined by how much a [[bestiality|trainer loves its Pokémon]].

Contrary to what [[some argue|some may believe]], Lopunny are [[lie|''always'' female]]. [[No exceptions]].

==YouTube Worship==
As it would also be expected, many [[YouTube]]rs make Lopunny-themed videos, most of which are so called "tributes" consisting of [[art theft|stolen images]] and [[copyright]]ed music, and the remaining few are just [[shit nobody cares about|gameplay clips]].

==Typical Fanfiction==
Fanfiction writings are just another aspect of this horrid fandom. Many [[fanboys]] will spend their time writing stories filled with grammatical errors that read as if they were written by [[13 year old boy]]s; hell, only 13 year old pre-pubescent fanboys would write fake stories about [[playboy]] bunnygirls anyway.

<div style="height:225px; overflow:scroll; border: 5px solid #A46846; padding: 3px; background: #F8EDCB; vertical-align: top; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; margin-bottom: 3px;">
"...try the same spot tomorrow. It can't be hunted out this soon." is Ash's decision.

May is not so sure of that. For one thing, tho Pokewomen are rarely brainy, they aren't stupid, and one way or another word gets around that trainers are in the area, following which many Pokewomen leave. Still, it does take time for word to get out and Licksplit is unlikely to be the only one near here. So she makes no protest and the next day sees her again putting out bait.

Lucky or smart, Ash again proves right. They had been waiting for barely an hour when out of the bushes hops a brown furred rabbit Pokewoman about the same size as Ash, maybe a bit smaller, with lighter brown fur covering her lower legs and the tip of her ears that goes three inches above her head before curving down and stopping a half foot from the ground to bracelet-like tufts of fur on her wrists. With a distinct lack of caution, she jumps to the bait and bends forward, giving Ash a great view of her near D-cup breasts.

Ash was a bit distracted, but May quickly checks on the Pokewoman, to find …

SLUTBUNI - THE HORNY BUNNY POKEWOMAN - THIS POKEWOMAN HAS A GREATER DESIRE TO HAVE SEX THAN TO FIGHT, BUT SHE CAN BECOME VIOLENT WHEN ENRAGED WITH JEALOUSY. KNOWN ATTACKS: ENDURE, ATTRACT, CAPTIVATE

“So she’d rather make love than war?” Ash mutters with a gleam in his eye. “Well, I guess I can accommodate her…” With that, Ash steps into the clearing. Slutbuni is not scared off by his sudden appearance as most Pokewomen would be. Instead she blows him a kiss and starts to caress her beauties as Ash approached, tearing off his clothing as he did.

May guesses this is what is meant by “attract”, and it does seem rather effective, at least with men. So what were the others?… Ah yes, endure… she can keep on functioning long after other Pokewomen have become exhausted by pleasure. More of a defense than an attack, but… Captivate… hmm, those she defeats become her slaves to some extent. She’s sorta a low grade Pokeball.

There’s more, but May turns her attention to the “battle”, which is definitely a vigorous “fight”. Ash has already mounted her and is pumping away. He takes his time about shooting off for the first time, but does not stop when he has, to the joy of Slutbini who climaxes soon after him. The two continue to enjoy each other, in a variety of positions and manners, and May is no longer sure just how often each has come when Ash finally gives a big shout and slumps over Slutbuni. This is May’s signal to toss a pokeball at her and a moment later she has another addition to her harem.

It takes a fair amount of time before Ash can revive, and his 1st words when he does is “Where’s Slutbuni?”

“Here” is May’s response as she displays the Pokeball. “She’s not really much of a fighter, but we can sell her to a brothel for good money.

“A brothel? But that would be cruel!” Ash protests.

“It’s where a lot of Pokewomen end up.”

“But not her! It …it is just not ..”

May reflects that it is odd that Ash is wanting to defend Slutbuni from a brothel, while she wants to get rid of her. Fortunately a compromise is available… “Just turn her human and ask her what she wants.”

Ash finds this a reasonable idea. A minute later, Slutbuni is shifted to the transformation ball, and a little later, she is human, and is being told of the plan to sell her to a brothel.
“I go to where a dozen men will jump on my bones every day for cash?
“Why would I object? That sounds wonderful!”
Slutbuni definitely lives up to her name. “OK, you are going to get your wish. Now do you want to be human or Pokewomen form when you’re sold?”

==Fanart Glorification==
To make matters worse, ''every single'' [[furry]] artist has heard of this creature and has made [[at least 100|at least one]] fanart of her to place among their [[brawl]] screenshots and sprite [[copypasta|recolours]]. Most of these artists [[rule 34|worship her]] as if she were [[sick fuck|some sort of sex goddess]]; a small few just [[trying too hard|make her look]] [[kawaii|as cute]] [[unrealistic expectations|as possible]]. Some fanartists even go as far as making up an [[mary sue|original charaters]] based on her design.
