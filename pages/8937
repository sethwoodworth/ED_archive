WebTV
{{crap}}

'''WebTV''' ([[Web]] + [[TV]]) was possibly the only [[Internet#Internet_Service_Provider|internet service provider]] considered more pathetic than [[AOL]], and furthermore one of the worst ideas ever.  

Created by [[Microsoft]], WebTV allows you to surf the [[Web]] by plugging into your TV set and mashing random buttons on a keyboard.  This allows people who should not have contact with others to get on the net and post to [[message board]]s and [[usenet]].

WebTV has seemed to have [[death|died]] in [[2005|recent years]], or maybe not.  [[Who gives a fuck]].
