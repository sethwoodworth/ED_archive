Ricochet rabbit
[[Image:Richochet.jpg|left|thumb|Ricochet as some imagine him.<br>'''WRONG!''']]
'''Ricochet rabbit''' is a self-proclaimed [[Canadian]] satirist who's gone through several religious crises and is said to have participated in several ritual human sacrifices. He is well-versed in the scripture of [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[pagan]]ism, and many other world religions, and can be frequently found taking the piss out of generic Christians, [[wicca]]ns, or [[atheists]] in several of [[LiveJournal]]'s many religious communities. Of course anyone who can effectively confuse the less perceptive followers of gods by parodying them will end up with [http://www.ljdrama.org/index.php?p=612 an article] on [[LJ Drama]].

His previous modus operandi was to make disingenuous posts and call them 'satires'. His current modus operandi is to make pathetic posts and call them '[http://www.livejournal.com/users/ricochet_rabbit/283012.html an interesting existential crisis]'.

He's rumored to be highly attractive to the ladies, but his own proclivities turn to [[arborphilia]].  Besides, this 24-year-old [[Basement-dweller|lives at home]] with his mother. It is believed that the madness that drives him to his [[crazy]] behavior was inflicted on him by an [[STD]] contracted from a spruce tree.

He's also rumored to be funny, but there appears to be little solid evidence of this.

Banned from dozens of [[LiveJournal]] communities, he has sought refuge at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], where he has wasted large amounts of time creating supremely half-clever satirical pages about all the people who he is powerless to do anything against [[in real life]]. This includes anyone who has ever banned him for being a [[troll]]. His appearance here at [[Encyclopediadramatica]] thrills his little bunny ears, because he has no life outside the Internet.

Really, one only needs to look at them to realize they are not alike. One is a harmful hamster, the other a harmless rabbit. Don't be fooled!

If you believed this ludicrous ruse, a hamster and a rabbit are laughing at you right now.<br>

== The Nexxus ==

Reputed to be [[Ricochet rabbit]]'s [[LiveJournal]] [[sock puppet]], {{lj|user=the_nexxus}} was [http://www.livejournal.com/users/human_resource/603.html#cutid1 busted] spewing anti-asian [[racism]] by [[zheza]] and [[son of art]]. After [[Ricochet rabbit]] began to annoy the [[fat]] and nasty [[this_is_warmth]], but before he was cast out from her absurd [[challenging_god]] community, '''The Nexxus''' was making trouble in many other [[communities]], as evidenced by the [http://www.livejournal.com/users/human_resource/603.html#cutid1 drama] he caused at the LJ community faith vs reason.

It is believed that the madness that drives The Nexxus to this [[crazy]] behavior was inflicted on him by an STD contracted from a spruce tree that he had an affair with, driven by his sickening penchant for [[arborphilia]].

Though banned from dozens of LiveJournal communities, The Nexxus is thought to still be at large.  Sources say that he has sought refuge at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] and wasted large amounts of time creating supremely [[unfunny]] and half-clever 'satirical' pages against all the people that he is powerless to do anything against [[in real life]], which includes anyone that has ever banned him for being a [[troll]]. 

==Please Ban Me==

When [[ricochet rabbit]] was banned from [[challenging_god]] for the sin of calling the Christians there "masochists", he created {{ljcomm|user=please_ban_me}} in protest.  The object of this community is to give a suitable reason for being banned, and make it count.  If you are not banned, it is because you are a l00s3r!  Some of the famous people who have been banned are [[killhamster]], [[aussieintn]], and [[SwissCelt]].
