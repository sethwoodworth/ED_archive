Enter Geoff Plourde, sufficiently summarized as the wet dream of every amorous Republican Senator.

Geoff Plourde is a [[nerd]]y [[white]] [[Conservapedia]] admin trapped in the Gomorrahesque [[liberal]] stronghold of northern [[California]]. Like all good [[conservative]]s, he hates Jews, black persons, and liberals, loves [[Jesus]], and [[masturbate]]s to [[Ann Coulter]].

Geoff is obviously rebelling against [[Atheist|godless]] [[hippie]] parents who are too busy getting high and fucking to properly supervise their little dittohead on the internet, and as a result he has developed terminal [[USI]] from the flattery [[Andy Schlafly]]'s [[pedo]] goons employ during the grooming process.

In May 2006, I registered under the username Geo.plrd which I used until June 2007. As Geo.plrd, I completely misunderstood the dynamics of WP, leading to myriad screwups.|Geo, who seems to think false humility is endearing|
Within my first few days of being here, I attempted to gain adminship and appointment to Medcom, positions that I was neither qualified or mature enough for. I also proposed several groups that were complex and convoluted for the purpose of monitoring admins.|Geo, longtime [[USI]] sufferer|
I was appointed Overseer of MOTD and served until the Community decided to abolish the position, a decision that I did not handle very well. To put it simply, I acted like a small child, which was completely unacceptable.|Geo, who ''was'' a small child|
I served as a Mediator for Medcab and after several screwups (including a case that went to Arbcom) we parted ways.|Geo, whose [[USI]] interfered with his [[Wikipedia]] ass kissing|
The thought of a new user having to defend themselves from allegations made by someone with experience scares me, and is unacceptable to me.|Geo, who has trouble separating [[OTI]] from [[IRL]]

== The Move to Conservapedia ==
{{quote|In February 2007, I went to another wiki, Conservapedia. There I developed my "people skills" that had been sadly lacking and rapidly was promoted to Sysop, Siteadmin, and Checkuser as well as Senior Advisor. As a Sysop there, I experienced just how hard it is to manage a public wiki, and gained an appreciation of and respect for WP Administrators.|Geoff Plourde|who really means "[[FYIAD|Fuck you, I'm a sysop!]]"}}


=== Betrayal ===
[[Image:GeoffPlourde-abortion.jpg|thumb|left|200px|What is going on here? I don't even. ''(Geoff Plourde, second from left)'']]
 
Geoff Plourde, despite his [[USI]] and sycophantic worship of [[Andy Schlafly]], never registered as more than a bug on the windshield of [[ED]].

Until the day he turned up in [[IRC]], wheeling and dealing and whining for the removal of his mugshot from the [[Conservapedia]] page. He doesn't mind wielding their [[banhammer]], but he doesn't actually want his face associated the assemblage of [[right-wing]] nutballs Schlafly has collected.

In exchange for the removal of his picture, Plourde offered ED top secret mailing list archives and access to dossiers Conservapedia has been collecting on Rational Wiki editors and admins.
