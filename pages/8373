They Might be Giants

'''They Might Be Giants''', or TMBG, as preferred by the [[retards|cool kids]] who have no time for words, is a band consisting of two rather odd looking men from New York, both named John. The majority of the known world vaguely recognize one of their songs as being the theme tune to the long running, and not very good [[Americunt|American]] sitcom ''Malcolm in the Middle''. They are also probable p√¶dophiles, judging by their inexplicable [[crossover]] into the world of children's shows and songs. Incidentally, they are named after a movie in which George C. Scott thinks he's Sherlock Holmes, which is in turn named after Don Quixote's attacking of windmills.

They Might Be Giants are unusual in the sense that whilst the majority of their songs are [[failed]] attempts at scathing social commentary, the rest are simply children's songs, with a few completely random cheesy pop/electro abominations thrown in for [[antilulz|no apparent reason]]. After watching the above videos we can added the following to the long list of awesome facts about '''TMBG''': they're not great live, they know [[dick]] about kids and they are kind of into [[Nazism]]. Let's just say they don't get better the more you learn about them, and they definitely don't get better the more you listen to them.

Songs such as ''Your Racist Friend'' have such blindingly relevant lyrics as: 
{{quote| This is where the party ends<br>I can't stand here listening to you<br>And your racist friend<br>I know politics bore you<br>But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you<br>And your racist friend| For the rest of this piece of genius, please see [http://tmbw.net/wiki/Lyrics:Your_Racist_Friend here]}}

That [[shit]] is pretty much representative of the standard set by TMBG, and is why they don't get any airtime and have no fans. Another one of their profound lyrical triumphs is the song ''Hey Mr. DJ, I Thought You Said We Had A Deal'', regarding the horrors of payola, a [[portmanteau]] of payment and Victrola (the nickname of some guy involved in a scandal). Essentially, payola is when a band pays a DJ to play their song, and the DJ does not inform their listeners that it is a sponsored broadcast. This is an illegal practice prosecuted only by the state of New York. A song about payola is clearly destined to save the world, with it being such a burning social issue and all.

{{squote|They Might Be Giants is the name of a rock band. The band has an extremely unique sound, which others have tried and failed to copy. The band's lyrics are unusual as well, incorporating some very sophisticated allusions and imagery. To understand what we are talking about, you really need to hear some of Their music. | Unfortunately, this is simply not the case. Also, congrats on the [[fail|supercool]] way your article flows, and well as the capitalization of ''their''. All in all, good work.}}

===Getting Down With The Little Kids===

''Here Come The ABCs'', ''Here Comes Science'', ''[[No means no|No!]]'' and ''Here Come The 123s'' are all children's songs/albums by They Might Be Giants. This, coupled with their other work with children and love of live performance on children's shows leads the savvy [[EDiot]] to believe that [[pedophilia|foul play]] may be afoot. They have recently written a book for children, and it is a safe bet that some kids' bedtimes just got a lot more interesting.

Ah, the best thing about any mediocre band is the hoardes of [[batshit]] insane teenage girls who would die for them. Here are some favourites:

What happens when a really good performer covers a really good song?

The opposite of this.

==[[Shit nobody cares about|Fun Facts]]==
[[Image:Tmbg.jpg|right|thumb|You CAN NOT be fat and edgy.]]

* The band is over 20 years old, and they '''still''' aren't really famous.
* The previous [[ED]] page about them had two whole sections that were about a completely different band.
* A film has been made about them, ''Gigantic: A Tale of Two Johns'''. Critically acclaimed, apparently.
* They are sexually attracted to aerosol spray cans. That is a lie, but they are otherwise very dull.
* John Linnell once hacked People Magazine's website in order to make himself the Most Beautiful Person of 1998. However, [[Fail|he still placed 8th]], thousands of points behind [[Madonna]].

The film they are named after was produced in 1971, and in turn took it's name from a Don Quixote passage. In the film ''They Might be Giants'' a millionaire is placed into an asylum as he retreats into a fantasy world where he is Sherlock Holmes, the main themes of the film are his delusional hunches and incomprehensible motives for dragging his female psychiatrist into his world. It sounds rather good and [[you]] should definitely watch it, however the band have made it clear they only chose it because it sounded cool. Dicks.
