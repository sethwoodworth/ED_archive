'''Ashley Titsdale''' is a [[slut|young singer]] and [[actress]] who in [[2008]], managed to troll /b/ by making a cover on [[Rick Astley]]'s [[the best|super hit]] "Never Gonna Give You Up". Her trolling was not intentional, but yet she managed to make many /b/tards extremely [[butthurt]], whining about "[[stolen]] [[memes]]", and a [[Too old|20+ year old]] song that [[The Man|someone else]] owns the rights to. One of the reasons people felt butthurt was because she corrupted the lyrics, [[Transgender|changing "Guy" to "Girl"]].

== The Raid ==
[[Image:Myspace ashley raid fail.jpg|thumb|Newfags fail.]]
[[Image:AssleyHIV.jpg|thumb|Ashley has HIV reaches frontpage. Unsuitable for trolling as some idiot left /b/ open in their tabs.]]

The [[butthurt]] /b/tards jumped on the bandwagon and started spamming her message boards at [http://www.ashleymusic.com ashleymusic.com]. 

So far, so good, but the [[newfags|latest crop of anon]] had other things in mind, resulting in any lulz being still-born. Having [[BAWWWWW|rough times]] in high [[school]], and now on the [[serious business|internet]] one of those [[whore|vapid cunts]] who makes fun of them for attending keyboarding classes has the gall to cover a song that they spend [[Loser|many an hour]] sending links to from the computer lab. Well, they can't take action against the bitch that points at their acne in class, but they can redirect that rage upon the internet as part of the all-serious, [[moralfag|moral]]-crusading cadre of [[basement dweller|internet superheroes]]. So focused on the [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE]], the newfags forgot that [[Rules|Rule 1 and 2]], and that [[Obvious|Rules 1 and 2 apply]] to the name [[Anonymous]] and memes as well. Most of the spamming accounts had the same "[[Fail|Anonymous17]]," "[[pedobear]]," "[[Irony|Epic Fail Guy]]," and other retarded names. Lots of [[gore]] and [[Goatse]] was posted on her fanpics page, annoying the [[prostatot]]s, followed by LOIC attacks. But soon after, the [[newfags]] became too busy fapping to x-rays and shoops of Tisdale to care about the raid. Causing the first raid to become [[fail]]. The oldfags became [[butthurt]] over this, and decided to do something about the lack of lulz when the fapping was done.

The [[oldfags]] came up with a better idea and started spreading rumors about Ashley having contracted HIV during a rhinoplasty. With [[shoop da whoop|shooped]] screen caps from [[CNN]], they successfully managed to troll most of [[12 year old girls|her fans]] into believing she really did have HIV.

As usual, the [[newfags]] and moralfags come to ruin everything by being too focused on the [[internet hate machine]]. They created YouTube videos with stupid "[[Chanology|messages from Anonymous]]", empty threats about how [[Anonymous]] would destroy Ashley. The [[HIV]] rumor got harder to spread since it became obvious that Anonymous targeted Ashley. The raid ended up in fail and AIDS because of [[the cancer that is killing /b/|cancer]].

: [[Ebaums|And on top of that, the person who stole your joke]] actually finds a way to market it and [[Profit|make money]] off of it.

: You see, Ashley Tisdale's new cover of Never Gonna Give You Up, by Rick Astley has [[BAWWWWW|enraged Anonymous]] because, well, [[Unwarranted self importance|we made that song famous again]].
: Ashley Tisdale's cover of Never Gonna Give You Up is trying to [[internet law|capitalize on our meme]] (a sort of inside joke).
