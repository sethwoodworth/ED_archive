'''Friends Reunited''' is a website on the [[internets]] where you can reunite with all those [[geeks]] and [[nerds]] from your [[old school]].

== What's the point ==
Surely, [[you]] don't want to actually ''reunite'' with those freaks again? FR is made for the [[fattys]], the [[Dying alone|loners]] and the [[Buttsecks|bumboys]] who actually liked school. Now they're no longer [[13 year old boy]]s and [[16 year old girl]]s but [[bureaucratic fuck]]s with too much time on their hands, and they're coming back to haunt you. Run for your life AARGGGHHHH[[Oneoneone|!!!!!1]]

== Trivia ==

*You can find out that your gym teacher is in fact a [[pedophile]] through the [[message board]]s.
*That [[gay]] you used to bully committed suicide [[at least 100]] days ago.
