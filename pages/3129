Funny Bone

[[File:FunnyBoneLogoAnimated.gif|thumb|A healthy funny bone.]]
The '''funny bone''' or '''humerus''' is a crucial part of the human anatomy. Lack of a funny bone leads to [[anti-lulz]] and those born without one usually have a severe aversion to [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. Lack of a funny bone is the leading cause of [[butthurt]] and [[unfunny]] (a condition known as ''Milterpes'') and is invariably a factor in most every attempt to [[ED:VIP|vandalise]] and/or [[taking down ED|take down ED]].

Paradoxically, the funny bone -or lack thereof- is actually [[serious business]]. Those lacking funny bones or those with broken or damaged funny bones have to wait years for funny bone replacement surgery and transplants are rare since lulzy people are loathe to part with theirs and organ donor lists don't usually cover funny bones.
