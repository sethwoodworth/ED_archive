'''Orange County''' or '''The O C''' <strike>is</strike> was a [[television]] [[Soap opera]] about a large [[white people|suburban]] metropolitan area in southern [[California]] home to [[Disney]]land and many [[rich and beautiful]] [[Republican]]s some of whom are Jews, and many of whom act like Jews (eg. "Jew"lie Cooper). It served as a [[conservative]] foil to the [[communist|pinko]] left-wing rest of the state. The city is also well-known for it's huge population of [[Waaaambulance|whiny]], spoiled [[angsty teen]]s and its large So-Cal [[punk]] rock subculture (the fact that such a large community exists in one of the wealthiest areas in the entire [[US]] just shows how badly the term "punk" has now been [[raped]] from its original meanings).

The OC was created with the following chemical reaction:
 [[lol|LOL]] + OIC -> '''OC''' + [[Lolicon|LOLI]]

The OC was cancelled [[over 9000]] years ago after the [[retard]]ed scriptwriters [[jumped the shark]] and killed off the only interesting character, a.k.a. the one who [[lesbian|kissed a girl]]. LOL CANCELLED LOLOLOL.
