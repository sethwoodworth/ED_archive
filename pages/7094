Rromchan
{{Infoboxchan|imageboard_name=Rromchan|imageboard_logo=[[Image: Konata_fucking_Animax.jpg]]|date_founded=March, 2007.|major_boards=[[b/|/b/]]|epic_win=Admin's trollage.|homepage=[http://www.aniverse.ro Rromchan]}}

'''Rromchan''' is a [[Romania]]n imageboard affectionately dubbed so by its users as a play on the word ''rrom'' which in [[Romanian]] means gypsy, thus depicting the nature of the site [[Fag|admin(s)]]. The site is fucking dead for some months now, since no one gave a shit about it anymore after several slow-server days and falls. Its best phase was probably around 31 October the same year, but the admins quickly fix'd that by banning about half the anons posting there.

==History==
The site's name contains [[animu]]-related shit in it. [[Some argue|It is believed]] that the domain was intended for animu-propagation shit, but as the admin's tendencies grew to [[dickgirl]]s and [[4chan]], the result was the desolating site we see today.[[Image:Rromchan usuall macro.jpg|thumb|Typical Rromchan macro]]
For over a year after its beginning, it only managed to gather about 600 posts in [[/b/]] for crying out loud! As a result, most garbage left eons ago still rot at the page 10 (if it went that far) of every section. The only ones that DO visit are mostly trolls, banned periodically along with most other users for the admins' personal sexual gratification. The site itself consists of about 20 boards, but as their own /b/ is barely crossed, the others are staler than a meat putting left in the Sahara desert for 20 years.

As such, the site has become more of a place of anti-Animax supporters to troll the admins than anything but an active *chan.

===Teh October ban spree===
On October 31st, 2007 , a mass banning occurred, as the admins probably decided to see how their pet project is doing. Seeing some decent action setting, they decided to mass ban almost half the users: as shown into the picture to the right, any post considered lame by the admins being edited with red "This user has been banned for this post". The admin was compared by an anon with [[W. T. Snacks]], as his actions were similar to the famous' [[faggot]] admin from 4chan. Him and another anon that pointed out the bans were banned also, as well as most that posted on those topic, thus being broken the first rule of /[[b]]/, that of no rules.

As of November 4th, 2007, the site home page generated an internal server error, thus making the boards unavailable. It came back later that afternoon, the first post appearing on /b/ being of Anonymous complaining about users posting their story on wikis or proxyes, proving himself most likely as [[admin|OP]] himself.

==Admins==

The admins nick on [[Romanian]] forums is ''The Different Machinist'' (TDM, Machinist or Mechanist for short), also admining the [[Romanian]] official site of Animax after some [[buttsecks]] and [[gay|ball-licking]] at the ownership of the station. His real name is Comsa Dan, we'll be updating <strike>address and</strike> picture very soon. It's been found out through high level [[skillz]] that he lives on '''Sos. Pantelimon, Nr. 336, Bl. 5a, Sc. A, Et. 9, Ap. 37, Bucuresti, Sector 2, postal code 021623''' and the phone is believed to be '''+4.0216287332'''. On [[shit|Animax]], he pretends to be a [[loli|little girl]] under the nick of [http://www.animaxtv.ro/forum/profile.php?id=14522 Konata], thus proving his pedophilic, as well as transexual nature. As a side note, his/her benefactor and current lover is thought to be the administrator of the [[fag|oldest]] [[Romanian]] animu site, giving him great [[whore|satisfaction]] and of course, admin powers!!!!11oneoneone

===Adminâ€™s Biggest Fears===
* Being [[rape]]'d
* Knowing their [[butthurt|home address]]
* [[Party van]]
* Posting their Konata yuri on [http://www.aniverse.ro/a/res/60.html Konata related topics] or on forums. usually
* The mass anime fans knowing that they're the "respectable" admins from www.anime-club.ro and www.animaxtv.ro

==Censorship & other crap==

[[Image:Ban spree of october on Rromchan.jpg|thumb|Ban spree of October]]
The [[commie]] nature of this site is obvious, and while the [http://www.aboutus.org/Anime-club.ro original site] maintains the cover of [[democracy|democrashit]] and [[free speech]] over the truth of mindwashing, the Animax [[Romanian]] site and explicitly ''Rromchan'' disregard even that, where if you don't ass-kiss the admins, an instaban awaits you shortly. As such, any attempt to expose their faggotry is dealth with quickly.

The censor-rally doesn't stop on their site, as they're known to have brought their shit to [[wikichan]] when an article about them was created. Multiple users, obviously trolls, under different variations of [[moot]] (mootkyns, mooty etc) attempted to make a few [[blanking in progress]], and seeing they were reverted, started claiming a paralel universe sotry about the owner being a person named "Tai", which ensured great lulz among the [[truth]] knowers. While evidence of the same host usage were brought into the admin's attention, in a stupid attempt to give both sides some credit, an admin of [[wikichan]] edited it in an even more lulzy matter, and the article was soon lost and not-remade because it wasn't considered "reprezentative" enough or shiet liek that.

Rromchan is of course also known for banning for no good reason and in mass, or banning without visual evidence and then answering through their admin as some [[butthurt]] (fake) anon that dislikes the "Gaiafag [[faggotry]]", as seen in the macro above, in a stupid hope that the users doesn't have dynamic IP or knowledge of proxy uses, lulz!

Also, the picture in which Konata fucks another animu character is now instaban reason if ever posted on their boards. Go ahead, try it! (The ban can be bypassed by renaming it/resaving it under different formats)

==Fun facts==
* [http://youtube.com/watch?v=-s-sYWXhkXs Ripping off] the well-known 4chan 4evar without ever showing the source or original AMV and using it on official meeting from which they earned [[profit]] by selling manga and shit. It's expected they'll rip off something else this year, for the sake of lulz it's anxiously expected.

* Making an anti-online-animu [http://www.aboutus.org/pericolul-anime.blogspot.com blog] for the purpose of [[raping]] the online viewers and making sure the Animax site has nothing to suffer in terms of image; later [http://pericolul-anime.blogspot.com/2008/01/making-of-teh-lulz.html dismissed] as a way of making [[lulz]], but the blog is still active for google to index for ensuring their main plan keeps having echoes.
* OP is so dense, he won't have [http://aniverse.ro the main domain] redirect to the www for a year and a half now. Talk about technical piece of [[crap|art]]!

==Flood==

[[Image:rromchan flooded.jpg|thumb]]
On July 16, 2009, some of the boards were spammed by an apparent [[Poland|Polish]] bot. While some saw it as the [[cancer|cancer that's killing /b/]], others noticed the boards were already dead anyways, and the bots did the admins a favor by filling the board with just about [[shit nobody cares about|the same shitty posts that were posted anyway]]. The only bad thing that came out of it was the loss of the [[Lucky Star]] thread from 2007 or so, but some kind anon [http://www.aniverse.ro/a/res/445.html remade it].

==Memes==
Most memes are of course rip-offs of chan related ones too, but there was one in particular that stood out through his original posts. He's a [[namefag]] that uses the nick '''anonimu turmentat''', which roughly translated means "the wasted (from drinking) anonymous", most likely an irony to the translation of "anonymous". His style resembles [[trolling]], thus following in the footsteps of the 4chan memes, and he barely mimics his native tongue, using k's in stead of c's, a common replacement in SMSs.
