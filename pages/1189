Bros B4 Hoes
[[Image:Brosbeforedoes.jpg|thumb|right|]]
"'''Bros B4 Hoes'''" is an [[Ebonics]] [[catchphrase]] that can be loosely translated as: "My male friends are more important to me than my girlfriend." The statement is a [[Divide by zero|paradox]] in that it can either be a massive form of [[faggotry]] or, if done right, an epic [[lulz]] maneuver. More often than not, the [[wiggers]] who use this phrase are in fact massive [[fag]]s.

==The [[faggotry]] way==

To any close-knit group of male friends, a time will come when one of the guys goes out and gets himself a [[girlfriend]]. The guy in question is busy learning to win at life by getting laid on a regular basis, while his douchebag friends continue to fap to [[/b/]] and play [[Halo]] with their hats turned around backward. 

When they notice that their friend isn't attending the nightly [[WoW|raid party]], they decide that he is [[Pussy-whipped|pussywhipped]], even though he still hangs out with them when it's not Nerd Time. Feeling threatened by the idea of their friend reaching manhood while they're still stuck in stage one of puberty, they decide to confront him and lay on a bunch of bullshit about how she is "taking over his life," eventually ending with the bombshell "bros b4 hoes, d00d!"

Eventually they will get so jealous of their friend for getting more action than all of them combined that they will start to spread [[lies]] about his girlfriend, calling her a [[slut]] and a ho, until he either dumps her or them -- usually her. 

The girl usually swears never to date a geek again, thus making it harder for everyone else to get laid, damn it all. This sad state of affairs is just fine, however, for the "bros" whose closest thing to a date is
at least [[9,000]] seconds and ends in .mpg

==The [[lulz]]worthy way==

For the other 10% of the time, there is a way to use it as a lulz maneuver. There is a chance that you might end up with a girlfriend who turns out to be [[Drama queen|the center of the universe]], which means that she will guilt you and throw fits if you don't devote 100% of your time to her.  

If you actually WANT to see your friends for a weekend, she will start bitching & complaining to you about how you don't love her and you're a horrible insensitive dickbag. When she slams you with the inevitable "It's either THEM or ME" ultimatum, guilting you to choose between giving up your lifelong friends forever or losing her as a girlfriend, you casually say "No thanks, I think I'll keep my friends."

And just as her expression changes to utter disbelief that her selfish plan has backfired on her, you then say with a smirk:

<big>"Sorry, baby. '''Bros before hoes!'''"</big>

This will cause her to go into a fit of [[Emo|crying]] and [[cutting]] almost [[George Zimmer|guaranteed]]. You can now casually walk away as she collapses into a pathetic sobbing heap from the shock of having her human [[hugbox]] leave. Extra lulz added when you check her latest [[LiveJournal]]/[[MySpace]]/[[Facebook]] entry.
*<font color=red>'''REMINDER:'''</font> Again, this can only happen in the extreme cases where the "Them or Me" ultimatum or similar is used.  All other times it is done by either [[wiggers]], [[13 year old boy]]s, [[nerds]], or [[faggots]].
