Christian furry
[[Image:sonicjesus.jpg|thumb|sonic <3 jesus]]
Rarely found in nature, the [[Christian]] [[furry]] is an endlessly bizarre mish-mash of ideals. It appears this exists only because the Narnia series had talking animals and Christian overtones. Unfortunately, the spiritual side only seems to make them '''more''' [[batshit crazy]], as they make claims about the Garden of Eden being a furry paradise "''... because the animals were able to speak, clearly they were Furries.''" Are as likely to start preaching about Jesus as they are about the evils of [[fursecution]]. The only eventual outcome is for a [[Christian]] [[furry]] to begin [[whining]] about the lack of furry representation in the Bible, particularly the lack of detail regarding yiffing on Noah's Ark (also known to them as history's first furry convention).  After all, they DID require one of each gender for "reproductive purposes"...[[Irony|Ironically]], Christian furries claim to be straight and condemn [[homosexuality]], yet they partake in faggotry themselves.

==[[WTF|Furry Jesus]]==
What was once an image of [[win|greatness]] has been [[Rape|sodomized beyond repair.]]

[[Last_thursday|Long ago]], a mass of white supremacists deluded themselves into thinking the son of [[God]] was [[white]] (and born in the Middle East), and it was [[fact|so]]. [[Last_thursday|Not long ago]], a mass of people who [[fap]] to The Lion King deluded themselves into thinking the beacon of all that is good supports their fetish, and it wasn't quite so, but the image will never leave the minds of some. Further proof that furries ruin everything.

Image:Furry jesus.jpg|[[Furry|Furries]] have their own version of Jesus. While some consider the Furry Jesus a myth, he has been mentioned in The New Testament. Notice the mixture of human an animal characteristics, especially the fur. Furry Jesus also has [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|dragon]] wings for the dragon furries.

==But Of Course...==

The following was taken from the [[fursecution|anti-furry]] website [http://www.crushyiffdestroy.com/show/furryjesus CrushYiffDestroy]. We at [[ED]] couldn't have put it better:

{{squote|Just a final note: I was actually just a little relieved when my Google search for furry Christian images didn't turn up any furry Jesus porn. Furries often criticized for destroying everything it touches by turning it all into one weird-ass pornographic gumbo mishmash. Could it be that in a major religious figure like Jesus we've found a subject that can actually be "furrified" without degenerating into complete swill?

OH WAIT:|Well, it had to happen.}}
