'''[[BCO]]''', also known as '''board.crewcial.org''' but generally referred to in the abbreviated form (or as emo faggots), is a message board for 'scenesters' and 'hipsters' (see [[Emo]]).

Entries on '''[[BCO]]''' consist mostly of "What are you _____?" (fill in the blank with a verb, such as 'eating' or 'thinking') and "POLL: _____" (fill in the blank with some asinine question; these generally start with "Should I....?") as well as other various ramblings including (but not limited to) [[music]], fashion and [[suicide]]. Most people post here while they're at work or while they're surfing the [[Internets]] from their parents' [[Josef_Fritzl | basement]]/attic.

''[[Jameth]], I have no idea who you are so maybe you missed out on the  whole '[[Elite | Elitism]], Secrecy, Tradition' thing, but I think I speak for most of us in saying that we have no desire to be a part of any livejournal / internet [[drama]] site and would appreciate not having BCO linked off of it much less a fucking entry.''
