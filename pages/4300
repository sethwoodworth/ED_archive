'''Jessica Brooks''' is an [[16-year-old girl|18-year-old girl]] from Evansville, [[Indiana]], famous for [[epic fail|dousing herself with gasoline]] in an [[YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG|attempt to ward off lice]]. [[I'm Dying Squirtle|The obvious ensued]].

== The Jessica Brooks Story, Living The [[white trash|Simple Life]] ==

Our story begins [[last Thursday]] in September or 1990.  [[Nintendo|Super Mario Brothers 3]] was quickly becoming the number one selling video game of all time because the only things to do back then were get [[AIDS]] or play vidya games and probably get AIDS anyway.  We're led into a [[war]] in the [[Iraq|desert]] by a man named [[George Bush]] (but this would only be the first time...). And, somewhere in the [[shithole|American heartland]], crawled Jessica Brooks from it's mother's [[Girlvinyl's_Vagina|cursed, rotten snatch]] (no word on if she [[Maury|knew who the father was]]).

Jessica would live the life of your typical [[redneck|Indiana]] [[jailbait|teenager]]  over the years.  She went to [[school]] and [[No|learned basic math and literacy]].  She began using the word "Ya'll!" in every other sentence, and pledged herself to [[Raptor Jesus|God]]. [[Loli|At age 11]], she lost her virginity to her neighbor/[[incest|father]]/[[bestiality|dairy cow]]/[[Divide by zero|uncle]].  [[16-year-old girl|At 15]], tired of fitting the [[redneck]] [[stereotype]] to the [[truth|tee]], she decided to get her teeth fixed and saw an orthodontist who put braces that remain [[fellatio|in her mouth]] to this day.

Of course, she wasn't fooling anyone and, when school proved too [[retard|challenging]] for her, she moved out of her mom's [[basement|house]] and began work on her [[Nice try|GED]]. With time, she hoped to one day start a career alongside her sister in [[McDonald's|the service industry]].  While attending a [[Republican]]/[[KKK|White Supremacist]] rally in [[Indiana|Bloomington]], she met the man of her dreams, a dipshit with a trailer-park goatee.  They were engaged to be married in May 2009, her having almost certainly been [[teen mother|knocked up]] [[last thursday]] parked in a camaro behind the dumpster at Denny's.

However, her trailer-park princess happy ending was not to be.

== [[doing it wrong|The DeLousing]] ==

Personal hygiene has not fully caught on in the boondocks and [[some argue|scientists have confirmed]] that it certainly never will.  Ergo, on Sunday, February 22, 2009, she sought to rid herself of a [[Giant enemy crab|lice]] infestation in her hair. Being a [[white trash]] [[wigger]] and general stupids, she reasoned that instead of spending $10 on a box of Rid, she could save the money and buy some [[meth]].  Her plan was simple: She would siphon the gas out of some [[You|poor]] fuck's car, [[idiot|douse her hair in it]], which would in turn rid her of lice, somehow. As might be expected with a [[woman]], she didn't realize that gasoline fumes are easily ignited. Unfortunately for Jessica, when it came to the implementation of her [[Retarded|well thought out]] plan, things went awry.  

While news accounts point to a pilot-light from her apartment's heater, she probably decided after about 8 PBRs that it'd be nice to let her hair air-dry while smoking a Newport. With Smoky the Bear absent, a [[Flame war|BBQ party]] commenced on her face.  [[paramedics|Party crashers]] showed up shortly afterward to put out the smoldering [[failure]]'s remains. 

[[FACT|They say]] that sometime after the smoke plumes began to dissipate, Jessica braved a weak smile and softly remarked, "[[I did it for the lulz]]".

== [[Lulz|Reflections]] ==

Currently, she's comatose in bed awaiting her [[Darwin Award|special award]] and the [[Death|benefits]] which come with it.  While she remains alive, she also, unfortunately, remains [[breeder|fertile]]; it might thus be premature to conclude that her stupidity won't infect subsequent generations.

If there's any kind of [[lulz|merciful]] [[Trolldin|God]], He'll end both her and our suffering by killing her the moment she finishes the [[pain series|long, painful process]] of healing her skin grafts, or alternatively, have her meander towards the [[Goatse|light at the end of the tunnel]] in her current [[Terri Schiavo|vegetative coma]]. Either way, until pictures of her looking like the [[Harlequin Fetus]] are found, the lulz will remain at only [[Fail|around 75%]] and will neither [[100|equal]] nor [[Over 9000|exceed]] 100%.

But hey...  [[kill it with fire|At least now she's lice free]]!
