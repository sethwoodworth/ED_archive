'''Chantelle Steadman''' is a mentally retarded, [[16-year-old_girl|14-year-old]] British [[Charver]] cumdumpster from the seaside town of [[shithole|Eastbourne]] who is well on her way to becoming the poster child for [[AIDS|the AIDS that is killing the UK]].  She is the [[retarded|proud]] mother of [[fat|8lb]] Maisie Roxanne Patten...or Maisie Roxanne Goodsell...or Maisie Roxanne Barker...or Maisie Roxanne (V)/Maisie Roxanne (W)/Maisie Roxanne (X)/Maisie Roxanne (Y)/Maisie Roxanne (Z)...depending on who the father really is.

At the moment, though, the British national [[media]] have awarded the prize of national spotlight, scorn and ridicule to 4'0" [[underage b&]] '''Alfie Patten''', who, at [[13-year-old_boy|12 years old]], still looks like he's eight, and accordingly is still waiting for his balls to drop. Alfie was [[epic fail|unlucky]]/[[stupid]] enough to be Johnny-on-the-Spot when the kid was born and was dumb enough to claim fatherhood. They've apparently been a couple for quite some time, and Chantelle swears on [[Shit|her mother's eternal soul]] that Alfie took her virginity with his flaccid, prepubescent cock.

Chantelle is not related to [[Hunter S. Thompson]] illustrator [[Batshit_insane|Ralph Steadman]].

Quicker than you can say "[[Maury|YOU ARE NOT THE FATHER!]]", two other [[underage b&|sperm-loaded minors]] - '''Richard "Don't call me Shia" Goodsell''', 16, and '''Tyler Barker''', 14 - recently admitted to having dangled their sausages in Chantelle's [[vagina|Chunnel]] around 9 months ago, as well as [[gangbang|at least five others]] in the hood. Why they're bragging about shoving their cocks in this [[Lily Allen|Chav whore]] is anyone's guess.

{{quote|There are [[at least 100|at least five]] other boys that I know who were all sleeping with her around that time. They’re all now wondering, ‘Is it me?’|Tyler Barker|Probably STD-infected.}}

Since the news media and [[shocked & appalled]] talk show bandwagon has just started rolling though, you can be sure that it won't take long to hear from all the other rampantly hormonal, high-pitched, squawking prepubescent [[dipshits|babydaddies]] who so much as [[fap]]ped anywhere near the bike sheds where this [[cumdumpster]] "held court" during lunch break.

{{quote|Having sex with her was the worst mistake I’ve ever made in my life. I wish I’d never met her. To be honest I didn’t really fancy her. She asked me out a couple of times when she moved down here but I kept turning her down. I thought she was ugly.|Tyler on Chantelle|Prior to donning the beer goggles.}}

{{quote|I liked her. [[drunk|I thought she was pretty]]. Within two weeks we’d had sex in her bedroom while her mum was downstairs. When we split up [[dumbass|I found out that she was having sex with lots of other boys]].|Richard|Reveals his appalling taste in wimmins.}}

{{quote|It was like throwing a cocktail weener down a large corridor, quite an achievement for a 15 year old girl|Michael Jackson on Chantelle|Prior to donning the Pedo goggles.}}

Media accounts suggest that there are as many as '''EIGHT''' British boys that may have promoted the [[FAIL|pregnancy]]. No word yet if Ms Chantelle has been nicknamed "Octo-Slut".

==Spoiler Alert==

[[Image:You_Are_Not_The_Father.gif|thumb|right|Were Alfie smart, he'd be dancing himself.]]

A DNA test has revealed that Alfie "dad at 13" Patten is NOT the father of baby Maisie. He claims that his world has fallen apart. For our part, we're certain that's he's dodged a whorish stray bullet.

Update: Science sez Tyler is the lucky father. She's still a whore. She's also a bitch for trying to convince Alfie (and the world) that he was the father, presumably because she preferred him over the other [[Bum|tramps]] she'd [[fuck]]ed, and knew what a naive, gullible little kid he was.

Watch out for her on [[Jeremy Kyle]].
