'''Tyler Peterson''' was a deputy Sheriff in Crandon, Wisconsin. On October 7th, 2007, at 2:00pm, after he woke up from a 45 minute nap and decided to take a stroll through the woods, where he was brutally [[murder]]ed by [[lie|a police sniper.]]

This sad incident was probably unrelated to the fact that 12 hours earlier, he went to a local [[lemonparty|pizza party]] at somebody's house, where his ex-gff rejected him, and all of her friends called him names like "worthless pig". Peterson went [[batshit insane]], grabbed his rifle, and [[pwned]] two male [[White|suburban dwellers]] and four [[16-year-old girl|hotties]]... Sadly, Peterson was only 20 years old and hadn't outgrown his [[fucktarded]] [[jock]] phase from [[high school]], so he may not have realized that in [[America]], calling a [[police|cop]] a "[[lol|worthless pig]]" is just like [[rape|saying "hello"]].



== News Report Highlights ==

5 hours after the murders, around 7:30 a.m, Peterson showed up at the friend's house in north Crandon. He calmly told the Kegley family about what happened, and spent a few hours talking and thinking things through. He told them they weren't in danger, but refused to get rid of the gun he had tucked behind his butt.

The family quietly called 911... and apparently, it took a couple of hours for the police to show up. The family would occasionally wander outside to look for them. Tyler took a 45 minute nap in the bed of his truck. A few [[Mexican|laborers]] from the family's construction company arrived at the scene, heard about what happened, and continued to call 911 "many, many" times.

Tyler's nap was eventually disturbed by the arrival of dozens of officers. They cordoned off 200 acres and began to negotiate... when you are dealing with an armed 20-year-old [[fucktard]], you don't want to take any [[pineapples]]. Negotiators couldn't get him to drop the gun, but Tyler made it clear that he was ready to deal with the police... Paraphrased, "[http://www.wbay.com/Global/story.asp?S=7185167 I want to turn myself in, I want to decide what kind of consequences I want to face, what can we do?]"

Somewhere around 2 p.m. Peterson walked off toward the woods. He got about 50 yards from the house and was [[Counter-Strike|shot by a sniper]], however it was latter announced that [[An_hero|he shot himself in the head three times]], twice under the chin and once in the side, while the sniper got him in the [[ass]]. It is widely believed that this force was excessive, and [[Don't taze me bro|non-lethal methods were available to police]].

After searching [[MySpace]] for 54520 Crandon zip code, [[ED]]iot researchers found only a couple of accounts with displays that read "R.I.P" - however one said ""R.I.P. nick brooks. your new band blows". Basically no one cares and/or less than five people in Crandon actually have access to the [[internets]]' tubes.
