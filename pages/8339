{{spoilers|text=MR. <s>HANEKOMA</s> HONEYCOMB ISN'T THE COMPOSER AND IS ACTUALLY A HIGHER BEING CALLED AN ANGEL}}{{spoilers|text=<i>JOSHUA</i> IS THE COMPOSER AND ALSO NEKU'S KILLER/[[Rape|RAPIST]]}}


'''''The World Ends With [[You]]''''' (moar liek ''The World Ends With [[JEW]]'', [[amirite]]?) is a [[gay|fun]] and [[retarded|exciting]] game from the creators of such [[shit|masterpieces]] as ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''. So you already know it's gonna make you want to write angry [[LiveJournal]] entries. It gained a shitload of popularity fast, because the [[wapanese]] like the fact that it takes place in their [[Japan|Promised Land]]. The game itself is really fucked up, and many fans will actually admit it. After you beat it, you unlock Bizzarro World, kinda like the Reverse/Rebirth level of that game with the key. Only all you do is play some crappy [[Beyblade]] copy.

You pay forty dollars for this. Did we mention how [[lie|original]] it is? Even its artwork and style is original!

==Square Enix based video game off a sex tourist==
In it's glory days [[2ch]] conducted a [[raid]] on a Tokyo sex tourist's [http://www.ghettocitiesclothing.com website] in 2003. The [[raid]] as wide-spread as it was, brought every last Japanese netizens including game developers over at Square Enix, before the website crashed and Japanese BBS were filled with plans to capture the webmaster Joshua Sehrer. Years followed, through a series of so zetta [[wapanese]] [http://www.ghettocitiesclothing.com/journal.html sex journals], [http://www.ghettocitiesclothing.com/videos.html videos] and [http://www.ghettocitiesclothing.com/photos.html sex photos] a few heads got together at Square Enix and came up with a game to match.

- The skull player pin's design seen in [http://youtube.com/watch?v=ObolpoFtI94 the introduction of the game], on The World Ends With You OST cover, on the TWEWY Nintendo DS, is of the tattoo on Josh Sehrer's left wrist. The joke on Square Enix was that Josh's tattoo was from [http://youtube.com/watch?v=tphGbq7YTzM this scene] in the movie Predator starring Arnold Schwarzenegger where the Predator repeats, "any time."

- "The game was officially announced on September 13, 2006 by Square Enix," [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Ends_with_You Source]. Joshua Sehrer's birthday is September 13th. [http://www.ghettocitiesclothing.com/objective.html Source]

- A lot of the video game's missions match up almost exactly to Joshua's sleazy tales of [[buttsecks]] with Japanese girls. The Pac Man sign in Dogenzaka from his 2001, 104 from 2004, Hachiko experience from 2005, journal.

==The Story, in all its horror==

You awake in some street as an angst wridden fuck named [[azn|Neku Sakuraba]], a [[pro-ana]] who apparently just got [[pwnt]]. He runs into a [[slut]] named Shiki, with a skirt about the length of your [[penis]] (since this is Neku himself we're talking about, it's not very long at all). They form a pact, and this gives them the power to [[shoop da woop|summon powerful forces]]. Later on, he <i>realizes</i> he got killed ([[shit nobody cares about|due to amnesia]]), and becomes even moar [[emo]] than before. He realizes he has to play a game to get his life back. [[what|Because it would be totally normal if he came back from the dead after three weeks of being worm food.]] After Shiki gets to go back to earth (and back to being a fugly cunt, apparently, since [[Lesbian|she borrowed her friend's body]] to go to the game), he meets [[Gay|Joshua]].

Then you realize what you got yourself into.

This guy can [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|fire beams from the sky]], and is worshiped in the fandom as [[Jesus]] because of this. Christ totally had laser beams in the Bible. Neku learns that this [[fag]] who's been watching his ass over the course of the second week [[pwned|killed him]]. Unfortunately, a [[furry|Lion Mathematician]] kills the homo before he gets to strangle him. What a pity. 

By the third week, if you still care, you team up with some [[wigger]] with a retarded Japanese name people use to [[BAWWW|make him cry]]. No one gives a shit about him, because the [[dumbass]] can't add zero and zero. It starts to get [[annoying|good]] when Neku meets all his [[bitches]] again, and they go to fight the [[Pedobear|Big Bad]].

Unfortunately, Neku loses his shootout with Joshua, the guy behind all this. Yup, some faggot was watching you piss and eat [[cake]] for three weeks. How [[epic]]. Some big dragon battle happens, and everyone comes back to life. 

Then you go to Bizzaro World. But if you're sane, you'll burn the cartridge before you even see the end credits.

==Characters==

'''Neku Sakuraba''' – This is possibly the most [[emo|stoic]] vidya game character since Solid Snake, except without the guns and the testicles. He just hates people, and tries to block them out with headphones. But he shops at the [[Apple]] store, so [[God]] knows they project the volume of a dying mouse. You can make him wear women's clothing if you make Joshua shove enough [[penis|hot dogs]] down his throat, but only [[yaoi]] fangirls and bored players do that. He has the figure of an hourglass, and runs a successful [[MySpace]] blog, where he shits his pants on a weekly basis about how his shorts aren't baggy enough, or how his [[cock]] is too tiny because of the [[Asian]]. He hates people and has no friends so it is likely that he did his fair share of trolling the internets pre-game.

'''Shiki Misaki''' – This [[anorexia|anorexic]] bitch is basically [[Kingdom Hearts|Kairi]] with long hair and a [[pussy|cat]] that does all the fighting for it is master, further proving that Shiki is incapable of doing shit. She makes Neku take his pants off in public. No lie. Unfortunately, this does not lead to an early [[rape]] scene, making the game all the more boring. She's utterly useless, and is jealous of her friend because she has more talent at [[sex|whatever they do.]] 

[[Image:PI_LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL.png|thumb|Sho Minamimoto, God of Minamimotoism, head of the Chess Club, and all around batshit-insane math teacher is the main bad guy. You're all soooo fucked.]]

'''[[God|Joshua]]''' – A simplistic little gay boy, who is also [[Jesus]]. He's constantly spouting innuendo, and all sixteen fans of this game either [[flame|hate his fucking guts]] or [[sex|want to take it up the ass from him.]] [[IDK, my BFF Jill?|He uses his cell phone to attack.]] The best thing he ever did was shoot Neku in the face just because he felt like it. Also enjoys giggling like a little girl, and has a voice that sounds just like a woman's, making him all the more creepy.

'''Daisukenojo "Beat" Bito''' – A [[wigger|cracker]] who uses enough slang to make an army of [[Grammar Nazi]]s pass out in utter shock. He is essentially [[retarded]] and is not afraid to admit this [[at least 100|several times]] on a daily basis. He can not and will not ever read. He was killed when he was hit by a car protecting his sister, Rhyme, but I guess it works out since he [[serial killer|ends up killing her a second time]] a day later. Good job, [[Wapanese|Daisukenojo.]]

'''Raimu "Rhyme" Bito''' – [[Shit nobody cares about|The fanbase]] says she's so clever, but she got killed twice anyway in a week.

'''Sho Minamimoto''' – In essence a [[Sephiroth]] clone, a [[furry]] who likes math more than [[mudkips|anything]]. He uses the word "zetta" in front of FUCKING EVERYTHING, so we're sure he'll be a new ''[[Rozen Maiden]]'' character soon enough. Is supposed to have been killed at the end of Week 2, but somehow, like a cockroach, survives and comes back in a [[zombie]] form that nobody mentions, even though he no longer wears a shirt and is covered in [[Tattoo|goth tattoo]]s. Is [[pwnt]] again, this time flattened by a soda machine, courtesy of [[Jesus|Joshua]]. It is obvious enough though he is still alive. Expect <i>The World Ends With You Again</i> to appear on shelves in the near future.

'''Mr. H''' – [[shit no one cares about|Has some name that nobody remembers]] because they are too caught up in how much of a pedophile he is. Mr. Honeycomb is also known as the "ultimate enemy" even though his [[furry|noise]] is a [[chasethehedgehog|shit recolor of Minamimoto]] and some random bitch's noise. Also turns out he's an [[angel]] and Joshua's [[bitch|partner in crime]]. Mr. H works a [[Starbucks|cafe]] because he says he likes [[testicles|beans]]. In the end, he and Joshua go back in heaven to get chewed out by God for nearly fucking up a Japanese shopping district [[noone]] knew about until this game came out.

'''Shuto Dan and Itaru [[what|Yokoyamada]]''' – Also known as [[Gun|"Shooter"]] and [[wtf|"Yammer"]], respectively. Two [[shota]] butt buddies designed for the [[LittleCloud]] circuit of fans. They play [[Pokemon|Tin Pin Slammer]] all day long. In spite of being [[jailbait|ten years old]], Shooter is some how [[win|teh champz]]. His friend, however, is basically that guy on the Game Show network who is always losing by negative points, no matter how many times he screams "NO WHAMMIES!" 

'''Mitsuki Konishi''' – Obligatory [[whore]], outside of Shiki anyways. Title holder in the game for the largest [[titties]]. Go figure.

'''Uzuki Yashiro and Koki Kariya''' – Also recognized as "Pinky" and "Lollipop," respectively, they consist of a prostitute and [[Kingdom Hearts|Axel's]] second cousin. They mostly just sit on the sidelines and [[fail|fill in plotholes with more plotholes.]] Despite their meager roles as the local fuckwits who no one takes seriously, they know shit. Unfortunately for [[you]], they prefer to sit around and eat [[Ramen|Weeaboo Crunch]] than help stuff make sense.

==[[lol wut|Another Day]]==

Someone took a really bad [[fanfiction]] and turned it into a bonus day for after you beat the game. In case you've forgotten, [[The Game]] is supposed to last a week, but Neku had to do it three times already, so LET'S MAKE HIM DO IT SOME MORE AS A BONUS! The deadies will LOVE that!

In short, concerning the important characters:

*[[Jesus|Joshua]] is openly gay and spends the entire day trying to rape Neku and raving about how much he loves [[cock|rainbows]]. [[Truth|I’m dead serious]].

*[[dumbshit|Shiki]] reveals herself as a [[yaoi]] fetishist and as a fangirl over the [[Prince]], a man known as the [[fag|Faggety]] [[Fop]] of Shibuya. Her and a rival gang of stalker-[[Prince]]fappers get into snitty catfights over who is [[Prince]] [[cult|fanclub]] reigns supreme. It turns out [[penis|Lollipop]]’s tiny-shorts wearing [[slut|partner]] runs the bad-guy stalker brigade known as the [[Satanist|”Black Diablos”]] or something goffik like that..

*[[shit no one cares about|Daysuekenodesubakane Beano (Beat)]] is an [[unfunny]] [[Dane Cook|stand up comic]] with his sister but blows it off to play [[Pokemon|Tin Pin]] and eat curry. He has a curry fetish now possibly because he has finally realized how, despite living in [[Japan]], he looks like the common western [[wigger]] and is therefore [[epic fail guy|fails at life in more ways than he ever could have imagined.]]

*The [[Ramen]] Don fucking created [[Pokémon|Pokéman]]s. What. The. Hell.

*[[nerd|Minamimoto]] is known as [[doctor who|Doctor Pin]]. When he isn't [[pedophile|flirting with]] [[jesus|Joshua]], he's selling the little prepubescent posse dubbed the [[wtf|Crayon Warriors]] bogus Pokémon cards [[for the lulz]].

*[[cutter|Neku]] decides to [[fail|try]] to be less emo by following his new [[fetish|passion]], [[metal|Tin]] [[penis|Pin]] [[secks|Slammer]], wait, no. “Another Day” is as fucked up as the rest of this game, so you can either follow the people above around and have lulzy fantastical misadventures in happy fappy fanfic land or go for [[final solution|Plan B]]: Stalk the coffee [[pedo]] and [[fap|muse]] about some kid you iced. Oh, did we forget to mention? The emo is a murderer [[irl]] now. Sorry. Or is it [[irl]]? Aw, screw it, nobody cares anymore [[amirite]]?

*[[pedophile|Mr. Honey-bunches-of-oats]] is all holed up [[WTC|on top of a building]]. You have to fight through <s>thirteen</s> [[over 9000|way too many]] floors to get to him, each with a different multicolored piggy and a [[redneck|red-hooded wall reaper]] who offers you a different kind of [[shit|food]], [[drugs|vitamin]], or sometimes some scary-ass [[cum|drink]] made of, according to the description, a [[cock|viper]] that was drowned in [[gay|flaming]] [[alcohol]]. Anyway, after you beat all this he’s at the top of the building, where he [[insane|babbles like a retard]] and decides to [[rape|fling himself at you like a spider monkey]], exposing the fact that one of the halves of his Noise form is a [[tranny|recolor of a girl’s noise]].

So, basically, it’s the same as the rest of the game, no?

==The Fanbase==
<center>[[Verbose|OH, YOU ARE MUCH TOO FUNNY MY GOOD CHAP!]]

{{frame|<youtube>fY3P4cL7pRU</youtube>}}

A brilliant response.

{{frame|<youtube>W5x8QQ7syX0</youtube>}}

LOL THIS IS SO FUNNY JOSHUA AND NEKU ARE SO SEXY [[DESU]] ^_^!!!!

{{frame|<youtube>lZUJ2kvhXfE</youtube>}}</center>

The fanbase of this game is, <s>mostly</s> in entirety, [[retarded|mentally challenged]]. They start to act as if they are, in fact, a part of this bustling city of dumbshits, and start to take on the character's habits. There is even a religion <s>in the works for</s> that has been created in honor of the Furry Math-lover (see below). Already, they are debating the usual things they whipped out when they liked Pokémon, which was [[last Thursday]]. The [[animu]]tards are already dressing up like them. But fear not, for once [[Square Enix]] releases their new SUPER ULTRA HYPER FUN [[animu|ANIMU]] game about angsty teens dealing with [[WT Snacks|the man]], they'll drop this fucker like a rock and start chatting about how [[awesome]] it is, and how it [[pwn|totally outdoes]] this game. Don't be fooled, because the same thing happened to ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' when this game in particular was released.

Unfortunately, this game was released in the [[America|US]] and [[Europe]] <s>mere months ago</s> [[at least 100|at least 100 days ago]], and is barely even at its peak of popularity yet. So for a while, [[za warudo|the world]] will be filled with [[loli|little girls]] [[shota|and boys]] squealing in pure glee about how cool [[fag|Neku]] is.
It is highly recommended that, should you see one of these people in the street, you punch them in the face. If they develop some common sense, you have done your job.

[[Image:Butthurtshofan.PNG|thumb|Sho is [[serious business]] u gaiz. This article is meen and has no fax to back up their ttly srs argumentz.]]

==Minamimotoism==

One day, on some gay ''[[Phoenix Wright]]'' forum, a bunch of fangirls (and a few [[fag|fanboys]]) got together in the video game section of the forum to discuss this epitomizing of [[pocky|the amazing and illustrious culture of modern-day Japan]]. They soon all discovered they had a major fetish for the [[furry]] Math Teacher. 

And so it became: Minamimotoism.

[[Scientology|As if there weren't enough retarded religions out there]], they had to add wood to the fire. They made up a set of commandments, and several images promoting the belief. Jew could do it, and [[Lie|so could they, right?]]. Now, if you go on the forum, you will no longer see waves of signatures advertising their passion for their [[ship|OTPs]] and their shitty [[fanfiction]] about [[gay|Phoenix]] and [[slut|Iris]], you will see [[over 9000]] signatures of them sucking Minamimoto's furry, pixelated [[dick]]. 

[[Some argue]] that this disease will spread to other places.

[[Raptor Jesus]] help us all should this occur.

===We've been routed out gaise===

UPDATE: They found out about this article, and are all extremely butthurt over it. They are bashing the [[chan|*chans]], because they <i>totally</i> did this, and it's all some big interweb conspiracy to ruin their precious video game. Awww, someone give them a hug, we're insulting their personal [[Jesus]] who doesn't even exist. They are now commencing with [[dumb|clever]] little retorts about how [[Serious Business|OMG THIS ARTICLE WUSNT FUNNEH I CUD HAVE DONE SO MUCH BETTER THEY'RE JUST BASHIN THE GAME CUZ THEY'RE JELUZ AND HAV NEVAR PLAYED IT. NONE OF IT MAKES SENSE CUZ THIS ARTICLE IS TOTALLY SUPPOSED TO BE SERIOUS AND INFORMATIVE, DAHURRHURRHURR.]]

Really now.

===X is garbage! CRUNCH! I'll add it to the heap!===

[[Image:Shominamimotoobjection2.png|thumb|[[Oh exploitable|OH EXPLOITABLE!]]]]

Despite the arguments of [[Fantard|fanfags]] that claim that the game is highly based upon [[The Internets]], this is only exemplified by <s>Jupiter's</s> [[Square Enix|Square Enix's]] resort to utter [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|newfaggotry and cancerism]] by trying to create a [[meme]]. Verily, observe one Sho Minamimoto and one of his seeming [[Forced Meme|catchphrases]]. In its basic structure, one is to take an item or some subject and identify it very plainly as [[shit]]. Afterwards, the [[newfag]] must proceed to crush the object/subject in his or her palm (quite problematic if it is indeed faeces). In conclusion, the newfag will thus complete their utterance by discarding this thing, regarding its worthlessness so.

<s>Viable</s> Stupid examples of this meme in action:

*[[Lurking]] is garbage! CRUNCH! I'll add it to the heap!
*[[Mudkips]] are garbage! CRUNCH! I'll add it to the heap!
*<s>[[Anonymous]] is garbage! CRUNCH! I'll add them to the heap!</s> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]

The meme also has the potential to be virtually used as a substitute for a [[NO U]].

*Your face/[[your mom|mom]]/argument is garbage! CRUNCH! I'll add it to the heap!
