Don't Copy That Floppy
[[Image:Floppy-main Full.jpg‎|thumb|Floppy disks: the mother of all storage devices.]]

Once upon a time [[floppy disk]]s were used to store porn and warez. It was important that young kids knew the evils of sharing information with one another, so the SPA squatted over every [[Computer Science III|7th grade multimedia class]] and shat out this video. If you actually had to sit through this video in school, congratulations; you win one free internet.

== Part 1: Don't Copy That Floppy ==

<b><i>Don't Copy That Floppy</i></b> is the coming-of-age tale of young adults Corey and Jenny, who are [[columbine|innocently playing computer games during school]]. When Jenny announces she has to leave ''(Not before totally owning Corey at mashing the keyboard)'', they decide to pirate the game so they can later play it at home. Little did they know they were in for more than they bargained. After a surprise visit by [[pedo|MC Double Def Disc Protector]] Corey and Jenny nearly escape certain doom with their lives and sanity [[rape|intact]]. And thus the pirating was stopped, and the world economy was saved.

[[lol wut|Also, they hid a frame of gay porn at 1:11]].

Ironically, this was filmed at [[Africa|Cardozo High School]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. A school populated entirely by [[niggers]], only one [[dead|white kid]] attended (for one year) in the early-mid 1990s. So the basic premise of this [[pr0n|video]] is [[false]]. In addition, the end thanks companies for "donating" software. Anyone can guess what "donate" [[Pirate|really means]], but it also nullifies any relevance the video has, as [[Fact|''they didn't pay for software either.'']]

== Part 2: [[Electric Boogaloo|Don't Copy That 2]] ==

Since floppies are shit nowadays and are only used by banks, [[your mom]] and government offices, [[nigra|MC Double Def Disc Protector]] has returned from the [[internets|hyperspace]] and decided to forewarn all [[warez|copycats]] not to copy anything whatsoever... Including [[tracing|shitty animu artwork someone else did]] for a tattoo.

== So Much for Fair Use ==
[[YouTube Commentaries#METOKUR|A YouTube commentary group]] released commentaries over both installments of the Don't Copy series. While the commentaries themselves are [[unfunny|watchable]], the true [[lulz]] came rolling in when the SIAA themselves ''(The organization responsible for production and distribution of the videos)'' [[Butthurt|filed copyright claims against the group]], and had the videos removed. Ignoring the fact that the commentaries infringed no copyright under the terms of the [[Fair use|Fair Use]] policy, it became blatantly clear that the SIAA knew as much about the law they [[E-lawyer|pretend to enforce]] as they do about making decent music videos. That, or they only choose to enforce e-law when it [[Greedy|suits their purposes]].

Though the commentary group filed counter-claims, [[Shit nobody cares about|pointing out the lack of copyright infringement and the applicability of Fair Use in the situation]], [[YouTube]] never brought the videos back online, taking the side of [[The man|the organization]] over those they provide service to. The group did, however, re-upload their commentaries to Vimeo, where they seem to remain unseen by the SIAA... [[Paranoid|FOR NOW]].
