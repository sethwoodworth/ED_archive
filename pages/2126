'''Joel Francis Zimmerman''' (A.K.A. '''Deadmau5''') is a Canadian disk jockey who is famous for wearing a mouse-hat that beams cocaine directly into his brain using microwaves.

Deadmau5 is notoriously a little bitch when it comes to interviews, especially when he is asked about the origin of his name. It originates from the time he rammed a mouse up his ass in an attempt to gain sexual pleasure. The chronic masturbation that ensued after he rammed the mouse up his ass gave him a minor stroke which caused him to forget about said mouse, and after a few days people began to notice the foul stench of rotting mouse emanating from Zimmerman. Ever since this incident he has been known as "that deadmouse guy". He refuses to accept any criticism of himself and constantly moans about how hard it is to be him while treating the people around him like slaves, adding fire to the rumor that he is in fact a pre-pubescent teenage girl. He has no sense of humor but attempts to make people believe he is funny by regurgitating memes he has seen on the internet.



His fans mostly consist of hormonal teenage girls and faggy looking fan-boys in tight pink t-shirts.


He also is notorious for having his songs stolen by [[OVER 9000|many]] other artists in their attempts to seduce him into having [[buttsex]], a seduction he gladly complies with. The most recent artist to [[fail]] at this is [[Neon Hitch]] when she stole his shitty song "Seeya Next Tuesday".


The name Deadmau5 is often buttfucked to near death in all internet chatrooms and video games, in an attempt to fool all the other 'Deadm1c3' into thinking that they are the true Deadmau5. Although a quick mic-chat dispells this as they nearly always sound like a pre-pubescent idiot on helium getting rammed in the mouth by their father.
