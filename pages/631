'''[http://www.artscow.com/ ArtsCow]''' is a website where people can get useless everyday items personalized with anything they want. They are also the cause of a period of Facebook friend whoring.

Sometime in July 2010 ArtsCow decided to offer thousands of free personalized mousepads to users of [[Facebook]]. All someone had to do to get one was have a Facebook account with at least 50 friends.

What a fucking retarded move that was. As soon as users of [[v/|/v/]] heard about this [[OH EXPLOITABLE|exploitable]] deal, [[circlejerk|small communities]] started on Facebook revolving around getting free mousepads. Simply joining one of these groups and friending fucking everyone got you enough friends in a matter of minutes. People started making extra accounts and made the needed friends on these accounts for extra mousepads, slightly changing how the address was written to avoid the 1 mousemat per household regulation.

It was an impressive feat for the /v/irgins, who were now farming mousepads erry day. All it took was proxies or an IP change to continue raping ArtsCow of their assets.

[[Cancer|Some people]] were too stupid to follow orders thus ended up having to pay postage. They then went on asking "OMG HOW DO I GET FREE POSTAGE?!?1" whilst flaming ArtsCow's Facebook and claiming it was some sort of [[scam]]. Regardless, the deal was over on the 1st of August 2010. Go home.

Shortly after this, ArtsCow started giving out free personalized memopads, but this required having a Facebook account at least 180 days old. At least one lesson was learned.

There was a rumour going around that mousepads had dead bugs in the packages. No, there aren't any bugs. Quit being gullible.
