Tim Buckley
[[Image:The_guys.jpg|thumb|right|Cuntley and some fuck ugly hoe woman.]]
'''Bum Tickley''' is the creator of [[CTRL ALT Delete]], a [[slashfic|webcomic]] about [[video games|games]]. The comic is notorious for being the worst comic ever created. You can ask him all about it on AIM: TimBuckleyCAD.

==Portrait of an "[[Failure|Artist]]"==
The son of [[whore|Maureen]] and [[furry|Robert]] Buckley, Timothy William Buckley is a typical third-generation [[American|American]] [[Irish|Irishman]] using his mongrel heritage as an excuse to engage in [[asshole|arsehole]] behavior, [[stupid|wackiness]], and [[alcohol|alcoholism]]. Also true to his Irish roots, he's been in [[partyvan|trouble with the law]] and has a remarkable [[unemployed|unemployment]] streak, which explains his decision to become a webcomic artist- [[lies|seeing as though they're always rolling in bitches and riches]]. He's also used a girlfriend's miscarriage as an excuse to dump her ass, which resulted in the expected [[drama|lulz]].

When the inevitable occurred and he dropped out of [[University_of_Phoenix|college]], Tim decided to use the internet as a vehicle to restart his life and in 2003 his abortion of a webcomic actually found something of a fanbase despite bland jokes, poor quality, and inaccurate video game references. However, it was Buckley's many, many other [[emo|issues]] that removed him from his [[dildo|pedestal]], including boorish behavior towards [[retards|fans]], pompousness, and begging for sales. He's since been removed from many convention invite lists and [[butthurt|hasn't been to any since 2006]].

==West Warrick Beacon May 31st 2001==
<i>Officer J Allen responded to a shoplifting call at Stop & Shop on May 26. Upon Allen's arrival he saw the suspect, Timothy Buckley, laying on the floor of the security office, tired and out of breath.

According to store security, Buckley was seen shoplifting and needed to be physically led to the office. Security guards said he was cooperative for a short time and then tried to escape again, fleeing towards the door.

Allen got Buckley up off the floor and proceeded to pat him down. Allen recovered two packets of El Paso seasoning in his front right pocket.

The store security said they observed Buckley on the cameras putting some items down the front of his pants. A veal cutlet and top round steak were recovered from his waistband. According to the report, these were the items he tried to push down his pants.

In total, $23.35 in goods was recovered from Buckley.

Timothy Buckley, of West Warwick, was charged with shoplifting and was released on a summons to appear in Third District Court. </i>


Who the hell steals food? [[poor_people|Oh, never mind.]]

==Pedobear Buckley==
Unlike the disgusting yet ultimately harmless scribbles of many of his [[Fred_Gallagher|peers]], Buckley takes his love of [[loli]] to new criminal heights by sending underage fans pictures of his gross, infantile dick. When the [[16_year_old_girl|victims]] express their disgust to other members of the forum, Tim deals with the drama by taking the high road: [[Banning]] everyone involved and then some.

Like arson, [[NEDM|animal abuse]], and theft to serial killers, [[pedo|paedophiles]] need to get away with lesser crimes (such as exposing oneself to a minor) in order to feel gutsy enough to commit [[molestation|greater crimes]], so like [[trolls|good net citizens]], we should take it upon ourselves to report Tim Buckley to law enforcement officials. For the [[lulz|children]].

==Buckley Butthurt==

While rarely using his forum as a means to mingle with the [[faggots|fans]] or, banish the thought, read constructive feedback to improve himself as a [[loser|comic artist]], Buckley manages to find the time to personally attack even the most garden variety of insults hurled at his shit comics with [[nerd rage]], excessive swearing, and hearty doses of [[NO U]].

The fact that B^Uckley can swoop over negative feedback like a hawk on a baby chicken indicates that he probably spends [[over 9000|over 9000]] hours a week combing his forums, ordering his loyal army of cock-sucking moderators to throw the banhammer whenever somebody puts his life’s work down. This display of self-worship and tyrannical authoritarianism reveals the true hypocrisy to Buckley’s nature, as he the was first to stamp the Nazi sticker on American Greetings when they threatened [[Penny Arcade|Tyco and Gabe]] with a [[lolsuit|lolsuit]] on some shit [[Last Thursday|last Thursday]] [http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/news.php?i=15#15].

In fact, if you listen carefully, you can hear him building a fail army to edit this page.

==Britanny Benn==
His love of his life is Britanny Benn, a rather insecure girl who's distant from reality and wants to be a vet to look after cute animals, collects My Little Ponies like it's out of fashion and talks like a 12 year old's first time on AIM.

She also is four years his junior and was courted by Buckley at Conneticon when she was just 17. Barely legal indeed.
It appears Buckley also ditched his current girlfriend once he'd realised he had a chance with Britanny.

Other stories include that Britanny's cherry was popped by Tim, along with the first time bonus prize of herpes.

==Greed==
In addition to the comic, he also has a subscription service where people actually pay money each month to see really bad flash animation of his comic. It's well-known that his site is secretly used by the government, and [[Fact|anyone who actually pays for this is automatically declared "too stupid to live" and killed by the CIA]].

==Hobbies==
Tim Buckley spends his days being an incredible asshole to anyone who may try to undermine him, [[shit]]ting out copy-and-paste comics with stolen jokes and stupidly slow plotlines and generally trying to make more money any way possible. It is currently unknown if he is actually a money hoarding Jew, however seeing as even the lowest Jews are experts at manipulation and golddigging it seems unlikely.

[[Image:TimBuckleyPenis.jpg|thumb|right|Tim Buckley likes to show his penis to underage girls. '''Yes, this is his actual penis''']]

He played ''[[EverQuest]]'' and modeled his [[Mary Sue|Gary Stu character, Ethan,]] after him as a recovering EQ addict. After his time with ''[[EverQuest]]'' he formed the guild "The Rapscallions" on the ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' server Dark Iron. This occurred in response with PVP and [[Penny_Arcade|Penny Arcade]] forming guilds along with their fan bases on the same server. Joining the legion of nerds who had brought about the most monumental influx of retards since the times of Ellis Island; he continued to ride everyone's coat tails while trying to be original. Over the course of time he inevitably lost interest as the guild made progress through Molten Core, where eventually loot disputes would take their toll. After apparently receiving emails from members complaining to him about his guild for a game he stopped playing on he suddenly showed up on Christmas week, much to the rejoice of his followers. Within minutes he went on a tirade about how everyone was bitches and to leave him the fuck alone, resulting in him kicking everyone from the guild in nerd rage. He wasn't the guild leader so everyone just rejoined but let it never be forgotten.

He then [http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/news.php?i=988 moved on to] ''[[EverQuest II]]'', even after saying [http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/news.php?i=563 he will never play it, ever]. He was on the [[Nagafen]] server, as a character named [http://eq2players.station.sony.com/characters/character_profile.vm?characterId=1064053120 Vithran], [http://www.cad-comic.com/news.php?i=1508 as mentioned here.] For [[Money|some reason]] [[SOE]] let him run a few [[CTRL ALT Delete]] strips in their EQ2 magizine, ''EQuinox''. Aside from that, there are no known [[lulz]] involving him and EQ2, besides the occasional goading from [[EQ2Flames]] users. Nobody knows what MMO he plays now.

Tim Fuckley also enjoys vandalizing the [[Wikipedia]] pages of other [[webcomics]]. This was discovered by fans of [http://www.halfpixel.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=414 some fat fuck] that runs some other unfunny comic called PVP:

If you look, you'll see that at various points, Tim vandalized his own page anonymously, then posed as CAD fans admonishing the vandalism. This was like Christmas, and my birthday all rolled into one email.

[[Image:TimBuckizdick.jpg|thumb|left|Tim Buckley is a [[Sick fuck|sexy beast]].]]

Yes, Fuckley not only gets off on showing his [[Dong Mosaic|penis]] to [[Chris Hansen|15-year-old girls]], but he also vandalizes not only other people's pages '''but even his OWN page, then revert the edits posing as fans sucking his [[pedophile]] cock.'''

Since his last account got ratted out, Tim Buckley now posts on Wikipedia now as "Thrindel", still attempting to keep the Ctrl+alt+del page clean of anything that might offend the e-peen he saves for the kiddies. His user page, and equally shitty webcomic page is a regular target of vandalism, however, owing to his [[Basement Dweller|pathetic]] existence he relentlessly [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel&diff=prev&oldid=260704803 purges] any edits to both pages within minutes and got the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel#protection.3F page locked] because he was butthurt by vandalism. Now the criticism section that B^Uckley [[Fail|tried]] to prevent is on Wikipedia. More [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Thrindel information here.]
If you want proof that Thrindel is in fact Buckley (apart from the fact that the edit history for that account is solely for CAD, apart from a few vandalizing edits of other, better webcomics), vandalize the fuck out of Thrindel's discussion page on Wikipedia for great [[lulz]], and then, once the dust has settled, try to visit the Ctrl+Alt+Del forums. OH WAIT, you can't! Your IP has been banned! [[No|Coincidence?]]

==Typical Tim B^Uckley Statements==

{{quote|Shoot yourself in the throat. Please|Tim Buckley|Responding to enthused fans who wish to see more of his [[Shit|comic]].}}

{{quote|
A miscarriage is definitely not a joke, and I have no intention of making light of it. And it can be a tough and emotional thing for couples to go through, speaking from personal experience. And I know that it's often much harder on the woman than on the man. However, I also know that it doesn't necessarily turn you into a sad, depressed sack of tears for the rest of your life. People can move past it, and heal.
|Tim Buckley| on the importance of sensitivity toward women [http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20080602]}}

This is the kind of [[shit]] this guy comes out with on a daily basis on his blog:

{{quote|You have all these freaking colleges around and no decent hobby stores that support wargaming? No leagues, no tournaments, not even a friendly free-for-all-game night for [[Warhammer]] players that we could then beat up and steal the tables from? That just ain't right, Connecticut. That just ain't right. If I didn't know how much stupid work it would be, I'd just open my own damn store."|Buckley, on wishful thinking.}}

Notice how Buckley here is trying to suppress years of high school locker-room bullying and parental abuse by imagining himself beating up nerds who, unsurprisingly, engage in the same activities as him. This is but one of many examples in which Buckley attempts to hide his feelings of self-loathing and inadequacy by mocking the culture his comic and characters (and therefore himself) are a part of.


{{quote|I consider myself an avid, perhaps even hardcore, video gamer.|Buckley}}
{{quote|I'm one of those people that doesn't finish many games.|Buckley|Hypocrite and lazy bastard all rolled in one.}}




===Boner for Emo Spider-Man?===
''Some anon's anecdote:'' [[Anonymous|I]] used to read this wankchop's 'comics', and one day he had written the usual load of shit (I can't be bothered to go find the comic, because I'd have to wade through every self-indulgent, unoriginal, badly drawn comic, and I'm [[DO NOT WANT|not]] prepared to do that. I like my dreams non-homoerotic thank you very much). So I decided to tell him what the world thought about [[Spiderman|Spider-Man]] via email:

{{quote|spider-man 3 sucked because it made venom into a
cheesy loser, whereas he should have been the best character in the
film by far. plus peter went emo.|Anonymous|informing [[Fag|Tim]] [[Emo|Buckley]] of the rest of the world's opinion.}}

And a few hours later, I got a wonderful reply from Mr. Cocknose himself:

{{quote|No Peter didn't go "emo" you fucking moron. Just because someone combs their hair a certain way doesn't define them as a person.

Don't clutter up my inbox with your stupidity again.|[[Pedophilia|Buckley]]|showing his love for emo pussy Spider-Man.}}

Anyone who saw ''Spider-Man 3'' can clearly see Peter Parker turns into an emo faggot. Buckley wants to suck some of that.

==Being Called Out on His Bullshit==
A user on Buckley's webcomic's forum called out Buckley on how he hadn't talked about video games in over 16 consecutive strips and was instantly perma-banned for "no reason".

==All In The Game Yo==
Buckley's yearly circlejerk [[Convention|Digital Overload]] is this year being held in [[Maryland|Baltimore]], a city renowned for its friendliness and acceptance of all creeds and colors where his loyal [[chrischan|fans]] are sure to feel welcome.

==Lol Bashing==
ED isn't the only one to make fun of B^Uckley:

* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Smo1nU1jsY Some guy doing a Let's Play video on Sonic the Hedgehog bashes Buckley at 14:30.]

* [[Yahtzee]]'s [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/108-Webcomics July 2], 2008 video ripped into him good. Lulz ensued. Before which, he'd pointed out that he hated Ctrl-Alt-Del's faggotry. ("23/3/08: You Cad" is the main one, but he mentions his dislike elsewhere.)

* [http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2885203&userid=0&perpage=40&pagenumber=1 A SA thread in General Bullshit making fun of the comics and Buckley himself.] Lulzy [[shoops]] can be found there.

* [[EQ2Flames]] users either flame or [[White knight|defend]] Buckley in [http://www.eq2flames.com/rate-retard/37726-vithran-nagafen-tim-b-uckley-your-webcomics-suck-dickflasher.html this callout thread.] A handful of [[shoops]] can be found there, too.

* And of course, all of [[4chan|/v/]].
