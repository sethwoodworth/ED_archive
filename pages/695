August Yifu
{{Later}}
[[Image:Fat_august_yifu.jpg|thumb|250px|right|This is '''August Yifu''', who is into [[castration]]. Ironically, many people are also interested in castrating August Yifu [[asking for it|at no charge]].]]

Every now and then, [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] manages to find a goldmine of [[lulz]]. And, as the [[fursecution|fursecuted]] will gladly tell you, we love ripping on [[furries]], no matter how much they may insist they're not [[sick fuck]]s. As a result, most of them relentlessly guard their [[WikiFur]] pages and personal [[dox]], refusing to let their non [[fursona]] self see the light of day. 

However, it is well known that furries lack any [[common sense]], so [[idiot]]s like '''August Yifu''' end up making our jobs a whole lot easier by announcing their [[faggotry]] ([[Win|and their name]]) for the whole wide world to see. Such actions lead to humiliation, [[Basement-dweller|alienation]], and plenty of [[lulz]].

==The Fursona of a Rubber Fox Fucker==

[[Image:Augustadult.jpg|thumb|right|August Yifu's latest incarnation. Unlike most fursonas, this one remains more faithful to the actual [[Fat|appearance of the creator]].]]

Like most furries, attempting to understand their alternate selves will lead to [[insanity]], and in some extreme cases, [[Goggles|gouging ones eyes out with a spoon]]. Luckily <i>(unluckily)</i> his [[WikiFur]] page does the job without the need for [[Suicide|casualties]]:

<i>
*August grew up twice, being a victim of age regression. This regression brought on unintended side effects: August <b> now suffers from total [[Incontinent Student Bodies|incontinence]] </b> and has developed some problems maintaining his solidity.<!--it's his BODY that won't stay solid-->

*Depending on his [[Emo|mood]] and the temperature of his environment, [[Drug#LSD|August's skin can appear to melt in spots]]. 

*This [earlier version] August is also what's known as a [[Mangina|cuntboy]], that is, [[FTM|a character that's physically male in every way, save for the genital area]].

*Rather than having normal skin and fur, August has skin comprised of living [[condom|rubber]]. Since its implementation, [[rape|the rubber has invaded and assimilated the foxcoon's entire body]]; August's body is now completely synthetic, albeit normal [[shit|bodily]] [[piss|functions]] happen in [[cum|seemingly]] identical ways. 

*August weighs [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|approximately <b>450 pounds</b>]] as of [[2007#October|October 2007]].

* He also has an interest in [[sick fuck|castration, penectomies, as well as other forms of genitalia manipulation]]. </i>

==The Wikifur Page==

[[Image:AugustYifu baby rubberfur.png|frame|[[Srsly|We can't make this shit up, folks]]; '''August Yifu'''' is a [[babyfur]] AND a [[rubberfur]]. Squeak Squeak Yiff! ]] 

It's not rare to find furries writing themselves into a [[WikiFur]] page, but most are not [[stupid]] enough to include their personal information in the article, [[retard|let alone the first paragraph]].

When called on to remove the information, August's [[gay|mate]] was quick to dismiss such concerns, as '''no harm can be done without a [[powerword|last name]]'''.

{{quote|The fact that anyone takes ED seriously makes me kinda giggle. Besides, without a last name, any ED article is more [[Troll|trying to stir up some lulz]] than actually attack people. The only real way it'd do any amount of [[butthurt|damage]] is if it had a [[Powerword|last name]]. And even then, how much damage would that do, given that only parts of the fandom and a [[4chan|few]] [[7chan|select]] [[420chan|internet]] [[anonymous|communities]] know about ED in the first place...? 
You give them too much credit.|August's butt-buddy Koebi.}}

He and his [[gay|boyfriend]] were overly confident in ED's inability to ruin them. So confident in fact, that we're sure they won't care if we say that August Yifu is, in fact, Austin Dalgleish from [[Redneck|Calgary]], [[Canadia|Alberta]], (now living in Edmonton) and his boyfriend is some guy living in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] named Paul.

Sadly, they failed to realize that August had posted his [[Powerword|full name]] on many other sites, as well as more [[Dox|personal information]]. It was only a matter of time before that information reached the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|public eye]].

===Wikifur Quotes===

{{quote|Austin is a [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Rotten_Furs rottenfur], and is involved in a wide variety of sexual [[fetish]]es such as [[Rubberfur|rubber fetishism]], [[BDSM|vincilagnia (bondage), masochism]], [[Fat|fat fetishism]], [[Inflation art|inflation]], [[Paraphilia|paraphilic]] [[infantilism]] (including such themes as [[Diaperfur|diaper fetishism]], [[Piss|urolagnia]], [[Crap|coprophilia]], and [[Babyfur|age regression]]). He is also a fan of transformation, primarily of the inanimate variety such as plushification and petrification. He also has an interest in castration, penectomies, as well as other forms of genitalia manipulation.|August Yifu's grocery list of fetishes.}}

{{quote|Austin has his own channel, #Yifu, which he uses to gather up his friends from all over the server into one place; he is in so many channels, that he frequently misses any of his friends that choose not frequent it, when they come online.|Translation, [[Noone|nobody]] visits #Yifu because nobody likes August.}}

==The Googletastrophe==
In April of 2007, August's mother and father decided to check out this [[Google]] [[Drug|thing all the kids are doing these days]]. They spent a lighthearted afternoon [[Stalker|Googling various relatives]], before they finally entered August's full name into the popular search engine. Lo and behold, a wondrous array of websites popped up, containing August's many, many furry-related forum accounts, along with an almost categorical listing of his many fetishes. In case you need reminding, just a few of those are [[diaperfur|incontinence]], [[babyfur]], [[golden shower|urination]], [[plushie|plushophilia]], [[castration]] and [[inflation art|inflation]].  

August, who freely admits that the things he defends as [[lies|harmless interests]] and hobbies "'''horrified'''" his family, immediately freaked out and tried to [[delete fucking everything]]. Some helpful [[trolls|chaps]] over at WikiFur felt that his [[dox]] were a vital part of the entry about his rubber-fetish, fat, incontinent, castrated, autistic fox character. And thus the WikiWar began.

==Wikiwar!==
August had a dilemma on his filthy, [[sick fuck|filthy paws]]. On one side was his humiliation at his family having discovered his sordid [[fursona]], and  on the other side was his insatiable [[attention whore|need for attention]]. This led him to first [[bitch|complain]] that he didn't want an article about himself on WikiFur, then change his mind soon after and request the same article be put back up, but under a slightly different name.

{{quote|I have previously asked not to be included in WikiFur (on the page RubberFox), but I have however changed my feelings about this; my family had discovered the page before I had, and were horrified. I myself was a little aggravated with the article, as no permission was given to document me, my personal information, or my copyrighted artwork. I was mainly in shock, but I feel that I wish to be included now. I have written this article, so it is up to date and much more complete than the old one, and it does not include my last name.  Please do not include my last name; <b>I do not wish for such search engines as Google to associate my private life with my full name.</b>"|August Yifu thinks the [[internet]]s is his secret diary.}}

The 'update' that August provided consisted of him removing all mention of his last name, as well as trying to make himself sound as [[fail|normal]] as a morbidly obese, pants-wetting raccoon made of rubber can. Even after his halfhearted attempt to hide himself, he still included '''his first name, location, and birth date''' within the article.

And so began the months of reverting on August's WikiFur article. And with each revert, a plea from August to stop including his full name:

{{quote|come on u guise, teh 'rents r gonna kno!!|August whines at the WikiFur community.}}

===Deviant Art===
Turns out August's family also discovered his now-defunct [http://rubberfox.deviantart.com deviantART page]. Learning this, he decided to create a new [http://augustyifu.deviantart.com "top secret account"].

{{quote|I am not a new deviant; my old account is RubberFox. <b>My life was over recently when my family googled my full name and found my account</b>. But I've worked up the courage to start over again, THIS time my last name hasn't been placed on my profile, so...
Anyway, I won't be moving over my art; it'd look too suspicious. Once I get settled down, I'll start submitting art again; I have plans this time to submit much more furry art"|My life is over, so I'm gonna go do the same thing AGAIN!}}

Basically what this all boils down to is that August is angry at the [[internets]] for associating his [[sick fuck|habits]] with his [[IRL|Real life]] name. However, if he really didn't want to be found out, he should have taken more care to [[retard|<b>not have posted his full name everywhere.</b>]] August is also under the bizarre impression that the internet is a place for his private life, and NOT [[Series_of_tubes|a huge, easily searchable public community]], where millions of people have access to every single thing he posts.

Needless to say, if his parents have the collective IQ higher than the average office fern, they could easily find his new information.

==The Ramifications==

[[Image:Yifu email.PNG|thumb|350px|He just can't help himself...]]

Since this article has been featured as Article of the Now, there have been severe ramifications, the comments on his new [http://augustyifu.deviantart.com/ super sekrit deviantART account] (sic) have now reached numbers estimated to be [[over 9000]] all of which involve his full name or location. And '''ALL''' of which are derogatory. He has not checked his new 'sekrit' DeviantART account since said comments where posted, but when he does it is anticipated to be much [[lulz]].

Comments from his new dA account:

{{quote|Hello, Austin Dalgleish from Calgary, Alberta in Canada, you should not feel relief Austin Dalgleish from Calgary, Alberta in Canada, because the fact is, Austin Dalgleish from Calgary, Alberta in Canada, your name and location: Austin Dalgleish from Calgary, Alberta in Canada, are still all over the internet. I hope your parents don't search anything like Austin Dalgleish from Calgary, Alberta in Canada again.

Also, the fact that you're TELLING everyone that your old account was rubberducky or whatever the fuck it's called still links you to your real identity, which is, in fact, Austin Dalgleish from Calgary, Alberta in Canada. Enjoy your sick faggotry, you fucking retard.| [[lulz]]}}
