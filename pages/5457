In the world of Internet forums and messageboards, "'''[[faggot|moderators]]'''" (often abbreviated to "'''mods'''") are the equivalent of [[Nazi|policemen]]. In fact, the only difference is that they have no real authority except over their gay ass web sites. Ranking [[shit|somewhere]] below administrators, they are assigned the task of ensuring the rules of the forum that they "moderate" are rigidly adhered to by the rank-and-file [[Jews|board membership]] while at the same time willfully ignoring these rules themselves. Given [[Magick|special powers]] by the board's administrators to assist them in this endeavor, it is common for these powers to be [[fail|abused]] at a whim, and when the inevitable howls of [[protest]] follow, to use these same powers to silence dissent. In a nutshell, moderators partake in intense [[fag]]gotry. 

==Types of moderators==

[[File:Moot being cool banning furries.png|thumb|When moderators do their job properly.]]

Broadly speaking, moderators can be [[divide by zero|divided into the following categories]];

#''Rule bound moderators'' - these mods are usually bound to a sense of community and Internet fairness. They will go out of their way to ban anyone breaking their arbitrary rules because they are "helping" everyone out. In reality they are slowly choking to death the very forum they circle jerk over. Very common moderator type.
#''[[moot|Passive moderators]]'' - this type of mod rarely posts on the board in question and will often [[lurk]] unseen in the [[emo|shadows]], hiding their online status, until such time as they need to wield their power despite being largely unknown to the community.
#''[[Corey Worthington|Vigilantes]]'' - actively cruise every thread, editing or deleting posts that are vaguely interesting or controversial, so as to maintain a general atmosphere of stagnation on the board. Most commonly found on specialist forums.
#''[[fail|Fucking hopeless]]'' - the most dangerous of all, showing precious little awareness of how to do their job. This incompetence often manifests itself in such forms as ensuring that [[newfags|new members]] are watchfully policed and [[rape|ruthlessly suppressed]] by recourse to, amongst other things, the Law of the Post Count (see below).
#''Teh popular ones'' - These are the mods that were appointed to their positions either by [[leech|sucking off the administrator]] or they have n00dz floating somewhere. These are usually [[16 year old girls|camwhores]] who you often wonder how they balance the life of being a [[MySpace]] whore and an incompetent mod.  Often they don't do anything except be really [[bitch]]y to [[n00bs]] and post their [[TITS OR GTFO|pictures]] in the Member's photos thread  wanting to be dickfed attention. (Ex. of camwhore moderator, [[verynicelady]])
#''[[Lowtax|The RL faggot]]'' - These are a rare breed of mod, but every once in a while, an admin takes a liking to these ladyboy [[trap]]s and decides it's time for a promo.  While "Teh popular ones" type of mod thinks she is in control, it's actually the "RL faggot" that proves the most dangerous (and also the most likely to be the resident "[[bitch|drama queen]]").  Expect them to get in nice and cozy with an admin, and secretly be their personal bitch.  We don't want to imply who the real bitch is however, since generally it's the [[Chris Crocker|ladyboy]] that becomes the most "persuasive" when it comes to decision making.  If you try to pwn them for their epic failures as a mod, they'll automatically show their faggotry by pulling the [[gay]] card.  Beware of this, but it's still epic [[lulz]]. 
#'''**[[shiny pidgey|ULTRA RARE]]**''' ''The laid back mod'' - These are the few and proud moderators who were former trolls and decided to balance being a troll and being a good forum user and ended up somehow getting picked to be moderators.They usually don't jump into forum raids right away because a part of them would like to see the epic lulz in action.They usually don't care much about [[spam]] and stupid [[furries|new members]] and it's rare for them to get motivated to ban someone.The admins hate these type of mods and like to often find ways to replace them with more of the types described above. But in real life they're really just basement dwellers who want to get respect from people on the internets that they will never meet.
#''[[fail|Opinionies]]'' - One of the most [[fail|uncommon]] Mods, there are only [[nothing|about one]] OPI Moderator in every [[forum]], and they usually [[ban]] people or follow those who disagree with them. Their mission is to find [[you|people who they don't agree with]], and simply ban them. They are waiting for [[you]] to do something that is "[[rules|against the rules]]" and "send [[you]] home" for that thing. They not only hate [[holocaust denial|people who have an opinion and should have the right to speak about it]], but they also [[rage|hate]] [[Agnostic|people who don't have any opinion at all]]. They are "the bad" Mods, but if [[you]]r opinion and their opinion are the same, they won't [[ban]] [[you]]. Even [[Satan|God]] is afraid of them. They are the Jew of the internet. These Moderators are [[Almost raped|almost]] the worst kind.
#''[[Emo]] Moderators'' - These [[fail|Mods]] parade around the [[forum]] telling other users how much everyone [[h8|hates]] them because they're moderators, and proceed to ban themselves [[9000|OVAR 9000!!11!1]] times. You rarely see these Mods because they're too busy being [[Fag|fags]] [[IRL|in real life]].  The only possible reason of them becoming moderators is if the administrators are [[Fag|fags]] themselves.

==The Moderators' Creed==
[[File:Lulzafterjew.jpg|thumb|Most moderators look like this IRL.]]
Almost without exception, moderators will operate under the following guidelines;

#''What's good for the goose is definitely not good for the gander'' - in short, established board members are allowed to rip the piss out of n00bs but should the [[n00b]] under fire actually fight back and start winning, a mod will step in (often by locking the thread, see "Mod powers" below) before the established member starts losing too much face. 
#''Law of the Post Count'' - an unwritten internet law that states that the likelihood of a poster being moderated, regardless of the merits or otherwise of their post, is inversely proportional to their relative [[Veteran|post count]]. The Law also states that the truthiness of any post is directly proportional to the [[e-penis|post count]] of its creator.  (However to those in reality, the higher the post count, the bigger a loser in real life the person is and the less worthy their opinions are.  But mods and admins like high post count people as they're basically minions in their army.)
#''This Is Not A [[Democracy]]'' - a phrase invoked when a moderator has been seriously [[pwned]] for making a crap decision, and will not (or, more likely, cannot) justify the decision in public. 
#''I'll see how I feel'' - a decision made by a moderator does not have to be consistent, but instead will often be arrived at through gut instinct and with absolutely no regard to whether or not a forum rule has been breached. Can often result in double standards, a basic requirement for any self-respecting forum.
#''Lets just take this to PM'' - When a moderator has been called out for being a faggot and a Nazi. Rather then face the masses and actually admit to being an epic [[failure]], they hide behind the cozy barrier of a PM and hide from the public like bitches.
#''You Don't Need No Stinkin' Thick Skin'' - Since every mod (especially older ones with high post counts) is an [[asshole]], there is often a rule in a forum that you should bring your "thick skin." Moderators however do not need to adhere to these rules. If anyone is being an asshole to them, they can simply throw a [[rage|hissy-fit]] and ban you without recourse.

|I had a quick look through that link, and the thread is something that I'd rather not associate with the board, so am going to delete it. This is not a personal attack on you, but that kind of stuff doesn't really help with some things I am working on for the board for which I have invested a lot of time and effort.|Sent in a PM. The link was to a thread of a scammer being well and truly [[pwned]] after being outed as a [[sex]] offender.

|Rizzle pizzle|posted just before locking a thread.

==Mod powers==
[[File:ElementB&.png|thumb|395px|The reason why mods are useless.]]
There are a variety of tools that a moderator can employ in order to carry out his or her duties efficiently. These range from the basic (editing of posts, maybe even deleting of posts) to the advanced (locking of threads, avatar and signature alteration).

These powers are there to be [[facepunch|routinely abused]]; for example, a thread can be locked yet some moderators will still post on it regardless, denying a basic right of reply to the [[OP]] or the poster who apparently caused the thread to be locked in the first place.

As a result, moderators are often some of the worst (or best, depending on your point of view) internet [[trolls]], which doesn't stop them from [[NO U|accusing]] others of trolling at every opportunity. Should a moderator start losing an argument on a thread, they will often use the aforementioned powers, like [[delete fucking everything|deleting fucking everything]], in order to attempt to beat a [[Whatever|dignified retreat]]. Either that, or go running to the admin.

==Forums are easy propaganda machines==
[[File:Motion-moderator electionsX.jpg|thumb|How moderators are chosen]]
It is very common and easy for a moderator to use their powers to turn their board into a propaganda machine.  They merely have to take a bunch of insanely absurd lies and propaganda, the more absurd the better, and then remove any dissenting viewpoints.  When people complain about the moderator doing this, remove these complaints and keep all the content saying the moderator is doing a wonderful job.  Bonus points if you do this while proclaiming your forum to be a place of [[free speech]].  Even more bonus points if you criticize other forums that do this while doing it yourself.

This is very common on forums and if you have the attention span to bother reading the [[TL;DR]] drivel, you will find each forum has people living in completely different realities.

==Moderator Induced Necrosis==
The law: - "The older that a forum becomes, the more reasons that Moderators find to ban the members". Eventually so many people have been [[ban]]ned and so many posts inevitably produce [[fag|hair trigger responses]] from the forum administrators that the [[sick|dreaded condition]] "Moderator Induced Necrosis" begins to set in. Moderators become more concerned with their own [[anus|status]] than the health of the forum and posters begin to drift away to other places where they can [[flame|speak their minds]] without having to [[Fellatio|kowtow]] to a bunch of people who have been overcome by their own [[Unwarranted Self Importance|self-importance]]. In the [[Catnarok|final stage]], all that is left in the forum are (a) the Moderators, (b) the occasional newbie who has wandered in by mistake, soon to leave, (c) the forum [[Arbchat|arselickers]] and (d) one or two [[troll]]s with the energy left to be entertaining. Soon after that, like a sun collapsing of [[old]] age, the forum dies, with only about ten members talking to each other about the same things [[Shit Nobody Cares About|over and over again]], stubbornly soldiering on out of sheer inertia or perhaps even nostalgia. The [[irony]] is that if only the forum founders -- who have often [[Wikipedia|left a previous forum]] in [[butthurt|disgust]] at the lack of [[lulz|freedom of speech]] - remembered their [[Basement Dweller|origins]] and removed the collective [[law|stick]]s from their [[anus]]es then the forum would probably have [[evil|survived]].
