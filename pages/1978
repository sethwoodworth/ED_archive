DRM

Big Media describe '''DRM''' as '''Digital Rights Management'''. However, since its purpose is to ''restrict'' [[you]] the user, it is more accurate to describe '''DRM''' as '''Digital Restrictions Management'''. '''DRM''' Technology can restricts usersâ€™ access to movies, music, literature and software, in other words; ALL FORMS OF DIGITAL DATA. Unfree software implementing '''DRM''' technology is simply a prison in which users can be put to deprive them of the rights that the law would otherwise allow them.

This ofcourse has lead into massive amount of [[butthurt]] and [[drama]] and after months of campaigning during 2006, DefectiveByDesign.org declared Tuesday October 3rd 2006, an international "Day Against DRM". With over [[over 9000|10,000]] technologists in the campaign, who pledged to take direct action to stop DRM, and with more than 200 "actions" planned across the globe on October 3rd.


==History of DRM==

'''DRM''' first came on the scene [[at least 100 years ago]] when people started recording songs on the [[old media|radio]] to cassette tapes.  This caused rich people, "[[shit band|artists]]", and [[lawyer]]s to shit themselves in terror and run around screaming "[[ZOMG]] THEY R STEALING OUR PROPERTIES[[oneoneone|!!!]]"  They then paid some [[Ethical Hacker]]s [[over 9000]] dollars to develop a way to keep music from being spread across the [[tubes]] for [[free]].

Today DRM is loved by [[republican]]s and [[lies|hated]] by [[Steve Jobs]].  [[Some argue]] that DRM will eventually lead to the downfall of civilization, but [[everyone]] else considers it to be [[shit nobody cares about]].

DVDs (or Bluray disks) you buy are encrypted and all of the video and audio on these disks are coded using a key that the hardware attempts to keep secret. Hollywood requires that all DVD manufacturers participate in this restrictive practice, and they can use the DMCA to make any device that doesn't participate in their scheme illegal.

This type of [[faggotry]] was but the foreshadow of greater ones to come. Standing behind the technology companies, [[the man|Big Media]] loom large. To increase their control, they demand technology companies impose '''DRM'''. Of course many of the technology companies now see themselves as part of Big Media, in example: [[Sony]] is a film and music company, [[Microsoft]] is an owner of MSNBC, and Steve Jobs, the CEO of [[Apple]], sits on the board of Disney. These technology companies cannot be expected to serve the interests of the technology consumer. 

[[the man|Big Media]] hope that '''DRM''' will deliver them what copyright law never has: they aim to turn our every interaction with a published work into a transaction, abolishing fair use and the commons, and making copyright effectively last forever. They will say that you accepted '''DRM''' and willingly surrendered your rights to such an extent that you will only be able to regain control by removing the software, But if you do remove the software you will also remove all your movies along with it.

You are restricted even geographically, and you lose your movies if you ever move out of the [[USA]]. You of course have to agree that they can change these terms at any time. ([[Microsoft]]'s newly upgraded Windows Media Player 11 user agreement has a similar set of terms.)


==the [[AIDS]] that plagues the intrusdy==

Each time [[the man]] forces you to upgrade your software, they same time downgrade your rights. Every new DRM system will futher rape you in the ass. [[Apple]] has also added more restrictions to their services, restricting the use of music and video.  But this is not just happening with music and video alone, DRM is being applied to knowledge and information, such as Libraries, schools and universities. Wich are adding '''DRM''', sometimes under pressure, often without understanding the consequences.

'''How does this affect us in the future?'''
*No fair use. 
*No purchase and resell. 
*No private copies. 
*No sharing. 
*No backup. 
*No swapping. 
*No mix tapes. 
*No privacy. 
*No commons. 
*No control over our computers. 
*No control over our electronic devices.

Note how this type of invasion of privacy would not be tolerated, if it came from some other source.

Users of free software are also victims of '''DRM'''. They can be locked out, and their computers won't play the movies or music under the lock. Products can "tivoize" their code (remove their freedom through '''DRM'''), delivering it back with malicious features and blocking removal.

The '''RIAA''' and the '''MPAA''' are actively lobbying Congress to pass new laws to mandate '''DRM''' and outlaw products and computers that don't enforce '''DRM''', thus '''DRM''' has become a major [[AIDS]] that plagues the freedom of computer users.

==DRM as AIDS==
DRM is related to [[AIDS]] in the following ways:
# DRM is a [[virus]]
# DRM is spread via [[anal sex]] by [[homosexuals]]
# Magic Johnson loves DRM
# DRM was released onto the [[internets]] as a [[final solution]] (like the CIA did with AIDS, [[amirite]])

==DRM as [[flame war|flame bait]]==

There are many ways to turn DRM into [[lulz]].  In any thread, comments section, or [[LJ]] community even remotely related to music or the Internet, one can achieve maximum lulz by recounting the many benefits offered by "protected" media.  These include:
* Letting the record companies put DRM in music files keeps prices low as they no longer have to account for [[pirate|piracy]]
* The [[MPAA]] and [[RIAA]] are only looking out for the best interest of the content creators
* The sound quality is better (or something)
* [[Hitler]] was also against DRM ([[omg]] [[Godwin]]!!)

Also, keep in mind that everyone on the Internet has an opinion, so try and be as contrary as possible.  If someone makes a comment like "I hate DRM because I should be able to do what I want with what I own," respond with something along the lines of "Well, I got in trouble [[last Thursday]] for beating my [[black people|slaves]], so you win some you lose some."

==[[X In My X|DRM?  In ''my'' Music?]]==

DRM is everywhere.  It's on your [[iPod]], your DVDs and [[CD]]s, and even [[I am in your base killing your d00ds|in your base, killing your dudes]].  It can be removed if you have access to Google and fifteen minutes to kill.  In the meantime, you can write [[The_Man|Congress]] and record execs to tell them that you'll [[deleting your livejournal|never buy music again]] [[Unrealistic Expectations|unless they get the DRM out of your music.]]
