Kerry Keane (a.k.a. dymaxia, unitedstates@is.rotten, and Kenneth Pangborn) is the only [[feminazi]], [[attention whore]], [[Usenet]] user, with a [[MySpace]] full of [[TL;DR|drivel]] and [[butthurt]] in existence.  Keane, an example of [[ED:Address_to_the_State_Follow_Up|the AIDS that is killing ED]], has vandalized this entry as well as others.

== fLamer ==

Kerry spammed Usenet for years under a bunch of identities:

* [http://groups.google.com/groups/search?q=author%3Akkeane%40unlimbo.unl.edu kkeane@unlimbo.unl.edu]
* [http://groups.google.com/groups/search?q=author%3Aluddite%40ripco.com luddite@ripco.com]

* [http://groups.google.com/groups?as_uauthors=cha%40cha.cha cha@cha.cha]

She hung out on talk,[[rape]], baseball newsgroups, and celebrity gossip groups. Like all attention whores, her real subject was: me, '''me''', and '''ME'''!!![[oneoneone|1]]

== [[Moar]] Lies ==

*Been raeped
*Is the (wo)man behind [[goatse]]
*Behind the [[GNAA]]

She does, however, like to take it [[in the ass]].

== Victim of the Usenet Archiving Conspiracy ==

There's nothing worse for an attention whore than having their pathetic crap flushed away.  Kerry thought that DejaNews (now [[Google]] Groups)  [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.food.cocacola/msg/70f57201af038d0e was purging itself of her AIDS:]

== Crash Into Me: The Meltdown ==

All that shit was nothing compared to what happened when she got [[Irish|drunk]] and totalled her car.  She thought it was [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.food.cocacola/msg/70f57201af038d0e a conspiracy:]

{{quote|Called Enterprise and left a message, and got a phone response from them right away, saying they had a car.  I mean, they called me almost immediately.

Got there, and yet another thing was weird : the car was RED.  It is unfailingly silver when I rent it.  Very weird. ...

As I was leaving, I saw a rather large middle-aged man watching me. The neighborhood is mixed race, and I know all of the white people in it, and I didn't recognize this guy.|Kerry, dedicated conspiracy spotter}}

As brain damage set in, she [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.china/msg/8ca6ca8371c20695 got crazier:]

{{quote|Can you believe this?  They were going into my apartment to list my CDs and my books and LPs, and they wanted to know the value of these things.

Casting lots is what they were doing.

Remember, only $183 until the junkie boys get rich again.

Don't you feel worthwhile?|Kerry, thinking that the conspiracy wants her crappy CD collection}}

[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.true-crime/msg/d39e19e3ee78015c And crazier:]

For the most part, [[noone]] cared, but someone looked into who she was, and sure enough, [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.true-crime/msg/ffe269851878dc6f it was our favorite tard herself:]

{{quote|I googled some stuff and her name is Kerry Lynn Keane.  What I gather from googling is that she was the one in the car accident and she was possibly [[raped]] at one time.  I googled the name Kerry Keane and it ties to this website.
[http://www.ripco.com/~dymaxia]|[[Noone]] cares about Kerry!}}

At some point she accumulated too much [[tard|brain damage]] to continue posting to [[Usenet]], so she went one step more retarded and made a [[MySpace]] page.  Much lulziness ensued!

== Putting The "Beat" In "Deadbeat" ==

Keane [http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=14581925&blogID=449983249 will fight for her right not to pay her medical bills]:

{{quote|I don't pay my medical bills!
I get medical bills and harassing phone calls from medical billers ALL THE TIME. ... I was strong-armed into getting into an ambulance on several occasions.|Kerry Keane, rebel against [[capitalism]]}}

Well, that's understandable, right?  However, during a later meltdown (since deleted), [http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=14581925&blogID=467096632 she told a very different story:]

{{quote|Why doesnt baseball stop you from hurting me.  To prove to you and your asshole un-generous woman-hurting buddies in baseball, who know this goes on and who dont tell you to stop, '''I punched myself in the head. Ive been slapping and punching myself in the head for about a year now''', and your baseball friends stay in their arrogant little matinee idol tower and bully me about their problem.  They have done nothing for me, but play up for the cameras what good guys they are. '''I have resorted to physically punching and slapping myself and checking myself into emergency rooms''' to get them to prove how nice they are.  They wont do it.|Kerry Keane, [[baseball]] fan}}

Come to think of it, she does kind of have a point.  Baseball guys have nice big bats, and she does love [[anal]].  Match made in heaving!

== Victim of Internet Stalking ==

Just because she spews her personal life all over the Internetz, that doesn't stop her from [http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=14581925&blogID=368682235 expecting absolute privacy:]

{{quote|If '''we''' find that you are filth on the internet....'''we''' will make sure that you get the "boot" eventually.|Kerry Keane, [[Crazy|split personality]]}}

{{quote|I envision a future in which obsessive, vindictive wackos never follow people on the internet AGAIN.  It is possible, people.  Menacing or hateful behavior online is NOT "part of the territory" and we should all be thinking of ways to banish these people until they get help and/or get in trouble.|Kerry, wishing she hadn't published her [[PMS|crazy]] everywhere}}

But you better watch out, because if you trash her, [http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=14581925&blogID=360132956 she'll take you to Internet court]:

{{quote|Following people around on the internet - snooping, hacking, engaging in private "intelligence".....[[E-lawyer|is ILLEGAL.]] ... Even companies like [[Google]] or [[Wikipedia]] have no reason to snoop on what you do on the internet and don't have much interest in it....unless you are engaging in something criminal.  For that, you would already have to be under suspicion of another crime.|Kerry Keane, Internet Lawyer}}

Kerry has even tried to [[Delete fucking everything|wipe out]] this page, claiming that its author was arrested.  No such thing has happened, of course, since there's no law against telling the truth about a psycho bitch.

== It's Hard Out There For A Slacker ==

Her brain damage caused her to lose her bullshit job buying books for a library.  Of course, hating [[America]] and especially [[W]] would never stop her from thinking that [http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=14581925&blogID=360999974 the whole country should have nothing better to do than to give her a free job:]

{{quote|Let's face it, there are no laws in this country that obligate you to practice compassion, forgiveness and consideration.  Once you've left a school or workplace, they all forget about you, as if you're not a human being.  Don't we all forget those with whom we've shared workplaces and schools and social lives?|Kerry}}

Well, they couldn't wait to forget about ''you''.

{{quote|I don't understand how my former employer can carry on as if I don't matter, and is if I ought not feel as if I have the right to anything, as if I'm to blame for everything.  I left Columbia because I felt it no longer had a sense of mission, I felt it had not lived up to its values.|Kerry, not understanding what the word "fired" means}}

Of course, [http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=14581925&blogID=360137659 it's not like she does anything worthwhile with her time:]

{{quote|I have to admit that I've always been interested in celebrity "gossip" but only because it dovetails with my interest in sociology and psychology - the relationship of celebrity to the rest of us, or the relationship of entertainment to the rest of society.|Kerry, proving that excuses are like assholes -- everyone has one, and they all stink}}

{{quote|I can't figure out what has happened to me that I can't read like I used to.  You would think that someone who had spent her life in academia would be able to get some reading done during a two-year unemployment period.|Kerry, who apparently never learned the word "lazy" in all her time in "academia"}}

And [http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=14581925&blogID=351867616 it couldn't have anything to do with her rancid personality:]

{{quote|Back in 2001, we were in a hiring process at Columbia....and one of the things one of the candidates said to me - after learning I attended Northwestern - was, "you have a reputation at Northwestern."

To me that was disturbing and absurd.  I tried very hard to keep a low profile while I was there.

It seems to run in the family.  I was just looking through my father's old yearbooks at De La Salle, and he said that his hobby was "sleeping".  Why I seem to attract people who hate me without cause is baffling to me.

I'm not blind or stupid about it - it's always been clear to me that they're nothing more than a bunch of creepy racists.  Creepy racists who get off thinking they've found their secret little scapegoat, someone on whom they can blame all of their failures and humiliations on.|Kerry, blaming it all on the [[niggers]]}}

== Descent Into [[Furry|Furrydom]] ==

But this was nothing compared to her adventures in the animal kingdom!

There's nothing like the love between [http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=14581925&blogID=354980967 a girl and her dog:]

{{quote|But the funniest thing happened the other day.  I walked up to Duke - and he playfully head-butted me and knocked me right to the ground!  It was so unlike him, but he did it in such a cute and playful manner. ... He had a frustrated look on his face, and he head-butted me, like he's trying to tell me, "I know you're having a hard time, and this is how people treat you."  He copies what he sees around him.|Kerry, whose own dog hates her}}

Stop [[rape|raping]] your dog and maybe he'll treat you better.

Notice how she manages to whine about how the whole world hates her when describing an incident with her own dog.

== Vandalism ==

It's not a big surprise that Kerry has vandalized this page. [[User:Dog_b675|Check this shit out.]] She vandalized the [[Buttsecks]] page!

Now [[User_talk:Dog_b675|everyone hates her]], and she's gone off mumbling threats to have us all arrested.  Ph33r her!
