Comments are most commonly found on the debris fields of trolled [[16-year-old girl]] LJ, [[bebo]] and Myspace users. They are the critical tools at the hands of [[fucktard]] Internet users who try to be deep whilst being unique and having a username that utterly enrages the intelligent or encyclopaedic user. It is believed the comment is the source of power for internets [[drama]] and [[whores]] in general. With each comment they receive, their ability to whine, bitch, and moan about anything is proven to increase exponentially. This is a very frightening thing, and often a good source of [[lulz]].
