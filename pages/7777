Once upon a time, a game developing company named BioWare decided to make a game based in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe, called ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''. Plot twist! Instead of playing a RPG as a character from the actual story line, you become a knight who is living [[over 9,000]] years before the actual story picks up. It turned out to be less [[fail]] then expected, [[fanboy]]s loved the bullshit. Then, ''Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords'' came out. BioWare saw the pointless turn based RPG set so far in the past of the ''Star Wars'' series a dying cause, and gave it to some other shitty company.

Well, now BioWare is back, better and stronger then ever ([[lie|proof being ''Mass Effect'''s successful release!]]). They have released that they will be releasing [[an hero|an MMO]] based in the ''Old Republic'' universe. It's called, '''''Star Wars: The Old Republic''''' (SW:ToR). It is still in development, but we can soon expect major [[lulz]] branching from this hump of fail.

Be sure to check in once it's released for the lulz follow up. Until then, please troll the forums.

== Promises ==
Apparently there are "huge dramatic" choices that will make "[[lie|real]]" impacts. They claim no other MMO has ever really told a story and has no actual in-game story line. They enjoy '''"Stylized Realism"''' instead of good graphics too! It will apparently be a ''Star Wars''-themed [[fail|Guild Wars]].
