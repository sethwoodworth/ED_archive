Allege
{{elaw}} 
Legalese for the truth.

Anything that has been '''alleged''' is invariably true but has not been proven in a court of law.  The use of the term allows a [[liberal]] to avoid being called up on [[defamation]] charges because technically the term means "[[rumors|rumored]]", regardless of [[common knowledge]] to the contrary.

That which is alleged is called an ''allegation''.  This means that the person who so alleges is the ''alligator''.
