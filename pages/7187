Safety

== Safety ==

Safety is a [[word]], that means the condition of being safe; freedom from danger, risk, or injury.

Safety is not guaranteed when you travel through time, especially when you push it to the limit and have done it only once before.
NOTE: If you are travelling through time, you should ALWAYS have a weapon and when you are travelling with someone else, you won't get paid until you get back.
This is not a joke.
== Existence ==
Today safety doesn't exist. With George [[W]]. Bush, the notorious [[time-travel]]ling nazi, and all kind of emo kids and [[hax|hax0r<zz]], there can not be safety.

== The Safety Not Guaranteed guy ==
Sometime which no one knows, this guy appeared. He tried to find someone to travel back in time.
 <Safety Not Guaranteed Guy> WANTED: Someone to go back in time with me.
 This is not a joke. P.O. Box ----, Oakview, CA 93022.
 You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons.
 '''SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED'''.
 I have only done this once before.
This is a hard proof of safety not existing. Maybe this guy wanted to get into safety, to 0 AD to prevent the time-travelling George [[W]]. Bush to get him. This fact has generated a varied levels of [[lulz]] around the [[Internets]], most of them around [[YTMND]].com
== Why is safety important ==
Well it's not if you wanna get [[raped]] by some suspicious people including [[Brian Peppers]]. Go ahead, [[lulz]]. 
Even nigga's in da hood aint' safe. Betta beware homiez or ya get somedun else up ya ass den thine PIMP.
