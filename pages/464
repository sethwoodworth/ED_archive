'''Andrew Geoffrey Kaufman<sup>[[âœ¡]]</sup>''' was the most famous [[IRL troll]] who ever lived, a man who [[patriot|dedicated his life]] to making people confused, irritated, shocked, and/or infuriated, and was the first and only man to make a living out of [[i did it for the lulz|doing it for the lulz.]]  [[Some argue]] that he is a failed comedian who would bomb hard at the comedy clubs.  Andy never considered himself to be a comedian and never tried to make people laugh.  [[Canadian|Jim Carrey]] is the reason why people think he was a comedian, due to the movie <i>Man on the Moon</i> inaccurately portraying him as one.  He was also pretty much the greatest person who ever lived ever (and not even his being a Jew can stop this) and is widely considered to be the father of trolling, and quite possibly even [[anonymous]] itself. Hey, it's a possibility.

== Why Andy Kaufman Was [[Unfunny]] ==
Andy Kaufman was unfunny because he never tried to be funny. He simply didn't give a shit about the audience. He was a mentally deranged [[asshole]] who did everything [[fap|for his own amusement]], usually at the expense of everyone else.

Examples of this include:

* Somehow being allowed on Saturday Night Live and doing nothing but lip-syncing and exaggerating one line of the Mighty Mouse theme song.
* Intentionally fucking up an entire scene in the show ''Taxi''
* Intentionally fucking up an entire scene the show ''Fridays''
* Informing the audience that [[women]] are more suited to cooking and cleaning, then wrestling those who disagreed
* Getting [[your mom|an old woman]] to pretend to have a heart attack and die onstage
* Getting his character, Tony Clifton, to select members of the audience and [[defamation|insult]] them, throw water on them, [[troll|embarrass]] them, etc.
* After pissing off the [[idiots|audience]] with his failure to entertain them, he would then proceed to do the best [[hillbilly|Elvis]] impersonation in the world, proving that American audiences are gullible and easy to win back.
* Leaving comedy to focus on a career in [[pwning]] [[women]] in wrestling matches.

== The Ultimate Lulz ==
Andy Kaufman's final act of lulz was [[fail|faking faking]] his own death. After realizing he was going to be owned by cancer, he decided to make all of his pathetic fans believe he faked the entire thing, [[idiots|some of them still believe it]].

== Patron Saint of Trolls ==

At 2:53 P.M. UTC on February 24, 2010 Andy Kaufman was declared the patron saint of trolls by [[4chan|/b/]].  Upon hearing this news, Sasha Baron Cohen proceeded to choke to death on a [[cock|bagel]]. And nothing of value was lost.
