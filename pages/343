Alexander4488/Approved ED Page
<!--DO NOT EDIT THIS PAGE,  THIS PAGE ONLY NEEDS EDITING IF ALEXANDER4488 VANDALISES THE ORIGINAL ED PAGE AGAIN -->

Game Dude is a brand new satirical video game reviewer that is inspired by the Angry Video Game Nerd.

He has been reviewing games for over 1 year now and mainly focuses on shitty games, although he has also reviewed good games such as Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the Mario Kart series, Star Fox, and Star Fox 64.

His videos are tributes to the Angry Video Game Nerd and unlike the Irate Hack, credits the Angry Video Game Nerd in all his videos.

'''Alexander4488''' ([[Power word|Full name]]: Alexander [[Muslim|Jared]] [[Nazi|Hans]] [[Paki|Badr]]) is a hilarious and smart  [[Canadia|Canadian]] filmmaker who creates wonderful video game reviews with the original schtick in them on [[YouTube]]. He also visits the Vancouver Film School, hoping to "become an even better director and filmmaker" and he is the greatest thing on YouTube next to the Angry Video Game Nerd, despite the fact that many of his reviews are funnier than the nerd's.

[[Image:Alex is angry.png|thumb|left|Alexander4488 dealing with one of his trolls.]]

But dare you ever insult or criticize him! Alexander4488 Googles other peoples names on a hourly basis to find out if anyone has ever written anything bad about him or his videos, so he can call their parents and get them grounded. If that is the case, he will mercilessly track you down and defend his good name while he deletes comments on his own videos that troll him. Fortunately, he responds to everything, showing that he really cares about his viewers.

{{quote|[[LOL]]|Summary of every video by Alexander4488}}

{{quote|So far, my goal is to [[attention whore|have no 3.5 star rated videos]]. I have [[more|one]] curse that needs to be revised, and that's the awful Mario Kart review. After that, I must have no 4.0 star rated videos, than no 4.5 star rated videos. [[Realistic expectations|They all must have 5 stars each, and I will reach that goal for sure]].|Alexander|showing how much he cares about his fans}}

{{quote|Actually, all my humor is very clever.﻿[[lolwut|Maybe it's just too clever for you. ]]|Alexander|being a smart guy!}}

{{quote|Regarding the two links: I fucked so many hot girls when I forced them to read your stupid comments.|Alexander|exposing him as a pimp!}}

Just like every [[Video Game Reviewers|video game reviewer]] on YouTube, he was influenced by the [[Angry Video Game Nerd]]'s videos, except Game Dude's videos are actually good.  He says that [he has sent hand-written letters to James Rolfe, and James replied saying how funny he was. He also created a hilarious video game reviewing series on YouTube by the name of the [[Epic Fail|Annoyed Gaming Geek]]. However, Alexander realized that the name was too similar to the AVGN's and changed it -- his smartest decision so far -- to the '''Game Dude'''.

The name changed, the fad remained: in his rewiers -- which are actually more like hilarious rants -- the Game Dude sits there and harshly reviews the games that deserves it, and is funny as well!. At the end, he invents new swear words and combines them to the point where they are added to the English dictionary. There's even more: The Game Dude also [[retro|rants about new games]] from old [[Mario|Nintendo]] or [[Sonic|Sega]] franchises -- up to the point where he trashes them because they now suck and are terrible.

To cut a long story short: Alexander4488's reviews are the best video game review series in the entire mother fucking universe!

== Theme Song ==

[[Image:Alexander4488 apraisal.jpg|center]]

When Alex isn't re-uploading the same videos over and over with minute edits because they got 3 1/2 stars (even though he's not realized it's trolls downvoting them just to fuck with him) he's also re-editing his theme song over and over.

<center><youtube>4OeGnVIOEwU</youtube></center>

But unfortunately for us there are [[Troll|enough people who are brave enough]] to remix said theme song and make it terrible.

== Fanbase == 
{{quote|fuck you jaquan1254, alexnader4488 is﻿ awesome|{{youtube2|Kylebuschfan187|Kylebuschfan187}}|who isn't able to type Alexander's name correctly}}

{{quote|I saw the Barbie commentary those two people in the commentary were making﻿ fun of you. [[Unrealistic expectations|Block them from going on YouTube.]]|{{youtube2|PaperShadow2001|PaperShadow2001}}|new to the Internets}}

His fanbase are the same scum that like the [[shit|wackiness]] of [[CAD|Ctrl+Alt+Delete]] or Irate Gamer's [[offended|unneeded swearing]]: [[13-year-old boys]], [[furries]], [[retard|retards]] and [[Ulrichthehedgehog|retarded 13-year-old furries]]. Like every [[fanboy]], they come to defend the person that - in their eyes - is the [[Lie|greatest and funniest video game reviewer of all time]], not realizing how much their [[God|idol]] sucks.

The reason why most of Alexander's fans are [[13-year-old boys|under the age of 16]] is that sooner or later they'll have to realize that Alexander's style of reviewing is just a [[ripoff|carbon copy]] of the [[AVGN]]'s style. Thus, they decide to leave the "fann comunity" and prefer to flame Irate Gamer's videos as AVGN Nazis.

== [[Spam|"Promotion"]] ==
Alexander4488 gained notoriety by his, let's say, "unconventional" way of promotion: [[Facepalm|spamming every gaming website and YouTube video ever]]. These hilariously blunt attempts to boost his popularity (and [[butthurt]] responses) can be seen here.

== Alexander4488 vs. [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] ==

{{quote|That ED article is just more advertisement for me and [[Lie|all game reviewers have an ED article]].|Alexander|failing to see how exposing him as a sheep fucker can be classified as advertisement}}


Because Alexander is typing his name into a search engine in a hourly basis he had to find [[Video_Game_Reviewer#Alexander4488|the blurb about him]] in the [[Video Game Reviewers|"Video Game Reviewers"]] article. In a case of extreme [[butthurt]] and [[batshit insane|insanity]] Alexander registered and [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Video_Game_Reviewers&diff=1998102573&oldid=1998101164 tried to delete his picture on said article] - [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Image:Alexander4488.jpg&action=history with two accounts]. The ED sysops didn't [[ED:VIP|tolerate these dumb actions]] and [[B&|banhammered]] his ass(es).<br>

But that's not enough! Alexander registered [[User:Mysterydude|a third account]], this time with the purpose of [[Alexander4488/Director_Commentary|"commentating" on this ED article]] and [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Alexander4488&oldid=1998136769 vandalizing it]. This, of course, got his ass [[B&|"suspended"]] again - but us here at ED predict that [[butthurt|he will return]], not knowing how much [[lulz]] he will produce.

'''AND HE STRIKES AGAIN!'''

This time [[User:Alexander4488|he]] [[ED:VIP|tried]] to [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Alexander4488&diff=1998179176&oldid=1998178920 delete his dox]. But unfortunately for him he's a [[Retarded|dumb]] ass [[faggot]] and doesn't know that articles can be recovered really fast.

'''AND HE STRIKES AGAIN!'''

[http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Alexander4488&curid=302806&diff=1998190610&oldid=1998190608 He just never learns.]

== Alexander4488 vs. HeavybassX ==

As with all attention whores, sooner or later they always gain their own Moriarty, their own Liquid Snake, their own Nemesis.   [[Spax3]] has Boomstick545, [[Chris-chan]] has Clyde Cash and thus Alexander4488 has [http://www.youtube.com/user/heavybassX HeavybassX] (AKA Tarosan).  

Despite giving the appearance of an overtly pissed-off four-eyed, overweight [[Wales|Welshman]].  HeavybassX has risen above the level of trolls to call out Alex on his faggotry and has [[Goronchev|intellectually checkmated]] the vein douchebag on several occasions.

Unfortunately, Alex never gets the picture that maybe shutting the fuck up for five seconds will stop HeavybassX.  But as he's an arrogant, idiotic [[retard|Canadian]] it means this will be a never ending [[forever|oroborus]] of [[LULZ]] for all of us!!!
