When one falls for his superior intellect, the target has no idea what role he or she is playing until (and if) he reveals it to them.  He is a self-professed master of secrecy, and a philosopher-prophet who embodies Yeshua and the Tao.  While having his aliases slightly exposed out over the years, he maintains that his real identity has never been compromised.  Before the Battle of the Alley, advanced metaphysical theories used to suggest that he was once immune to Google searches that can track down every single post a user has ever made. Whenever he was actually cornered and sonned, he would run to the defense of [[It was a social experiment]]. None of this explains the vast amount of time and effort he put into RM, though - at his height, he was actively posting for up to 12 hours a day.

''"Jonathan Richard Rex was born in August of 1981 and raised on military bases around the world. During his childhood he was hurled into several chaotic disasters from the San Francisco 7.1 earthquake in 1989 to the volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991. Two typhoons also assisted in educating him on the power of God and nature. At the age of four, he began training in Tae Kwon Do, Judo, and (later) boxing during high school, where he attended East and West Noble in North Eastern Indiana, playing football for the school and basketball for Campus Life. His summers were spent at Lake James Christian Assembly. After receiving his high school diploma through Newport Pacific High in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he traveled around the United States as a musician, pursuing a recording contract in the hip hop industry. Today he and his wife, Natalia, are beginning their sophomore year at Pittsburg State University where he is majoring in education with an emphasis in theatre."''

Some of the ludicrous boasts and exaggerations of Az can be seen here. On RM, he has claimed to have met and recorded music with Eric Clapton, worked as a DJ, bouncer, and so on. He claims to be from the Cherokee Native American tribe, in spite of his almost blinding whiteness. He also claims that he was born in Israel, making him a Jewindian with lots of culture and minority coolness.

===First Incarnation===
Azeus signed up to RapeMusic.com on May 15th, 2002 as [http://board.rapmusic.com/member.php?u=49981 Azeus_suezA], (clearly alluring to the mythology of Janus with his mirroring name) and [http://board.rapmusic.com/search.php?searchid=223394 posted frequently in the Poetry session].  [http://web.archive.org/web/20070112121519/jonathanrex.awardspace.com/poetry.html His trite, unmoving prose] was embraced by a few subhumans, but all in all, it did not provide nearly enough ego-inflation to feed his demands.  Had they only have known that Azeus has battled volcanoes and typhoons with his bare hands, they would have groveled in subserviance like the peons they were.  Azeus spun off the handle and [http://board.rapmusic.com/showthread.php?p=6711103 found himself banned in 2003]... but not without instigating irritation amongst the RM.fag denizens. He also met his "wife" around this time in the poetry section, who posted as Somberglance. They later met up, and AZ brainwashed her into staying with him. However, this is only one possibility - its widely believed that his wife was completely imaginary, and that he did not have a real relationship with the woman in the pictures he posted. AZ has also [http://board.rapmusic.com/lipstick-alley/1020129-most-memorable-rm-moment.html claimed that Somberglance was his alias], or that hes really Somberglance [http://board.rapmusic.com/lipstick-alley/1031784-yes.html pretending to be AZ]. Who knows, who cares - if he were Pinocchio, his nose would reach to the Kuiper Belt.

===Second Incarnation===
Azeus recovered July 22nd, 2003 as [http://board.rapmusic.com/member.php?u=71730 AzeussuezA] and decided that pretending to be a metaphysical philosophical guru would be a wise career move.  During his time spent in the [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/RapMusic.com#IntroSpectrum IntroSpectrum], the Taleus Project peaked and was winding down. (Ghet took on the alias persona of an [[Unwarrented self-importance|internet prophet]] preaching about the differences between humans and animals)  Seeing the influence of this simple method hold the interest of the commoners, Azeus was inspired and attempted to try the same approach, but instead, ended up recycling speeches from the Matrix in long-winded tl;dr posts.  At this time, Azeus managed to make permanent enemies out of Ill Rich, Black Soultan, Riz, Double ML, and almost anyone else he came in contact with because of his condescending and holier-than-thou "humbleness".

===Third Incarnation===
Azeus revealed that he is [http://board.rapmusic.com/showthread.php?t=1023702 Jonathan Rex] and on July 13th, 2006, [http://board.rapmusic.com/archive/index.php/t-996928.html providing many pictures of him and his lovely wife].  Confident his years of mocking everyone for not understanding him has solidified a loyal fanbase, he unleashed a monstrosity of a book called [http://board.rapmusic.com/showthread.php?t=1019411 Tao for the Christian Mind].  After the RM.fag mobs tore it to shreds and used copies were already availible on eBay, Azeus quickly discarded his identity, claiming that "SUPRISELOL I MADEZ IT ALL UP IM NOT REALLY JOANATHAN REX!"

==The Battle of Lipstick==
===Opening Shots===
[http://board.rapmusic.com/showthread.php?t=1068726&highlight=hit%20up%20every%20gay%20website Professing himself to be a master Internet Security Technicianisterism], Azeus believed himself untouchable and immune to the ramifications to over 5 years of cumulative [[fucktarded]]ry.  What Azeus wasn't expecting was Ghet was still reeling from failing to reveal the identity of Faviano.  Ghet redoubled his efforts and sharpened his online tracking abilities, swearing never to lose again. Within an hour and a half of making that post, [http://board.rapmusic.com/showthread.php?t=1068741 Azeus had his IP (4.65.214.171) exposed on ED] from an old banning that he forgot to clean up.

[http://board.rapmusic.com/showpost.php?p=15075863&postcount=20 Ghet called his bluff and said fuck off].  Meanwhile, Azeus was furiously contacting Janitor (the guy who runs RapeMusic.com) to have his IP removed from the old signature.  He also [[BLANKING_IN_PROGRESS|blanked the RapeMusic.com article 11 times]].  These revisions were undone within minutes and Azeus denied being [[User:The_Architect|The Architect]].

In this pitched battle, [http://board.rapmusic.com/archive/index.php/t-996928.html the golden gem of his identity was revealed].  His post he made about him being Jonathan Rex came to the forefront once more.  The Photoshop teams went to work and ED was notified of the recent gains in Ghet's camp.  Azeus, predictably, told everyone that those pictures were not him and then [http://board.rapmusic.com/showpost.php?p=15145212&postcount=40 suggested that he would be in trouble] if Ghet did not remove those photos:<br><br><center>

He turned down the offer, believing his Scorched Data policy of deleting and editing his content would save him.

If you even respond you show that you are not indeed differential towards me for you’ve actually formed an opinion worthy of typing out (which we know you only share for the ‘weakness’ which lies within you, seeking out the approval of at least one other person who will agree with you so that the weakness may be temporarily masked with confidence).
