Radium

'''Radium''' ([[Powerword]]: Kenneth J. Stumpf) was/is the webmaster for [[Something Awful]] [[at least 100 years ago]].  He liked to implement special forum features for [[FYAD]] to enjoy, such as [[Katrina]] and [[PHP]]. A [[retard|completely self-taught]] [[failure|programmer]], it's his job to apply half assed jury-rigged patches on an 8 year old version of vBulletin running on decade-old equipment to keep SA running instead of just paying vBulletin the three-hundred bucks to get a new copy.  He was "fired" for [[RL]] self-[[hax]], namely, downing the forums in an ill-conceived, [[butthurt]]-motivated attempt to strike at [[SASS]] that ended in [[fail]] and then lying about the reasons for the downtime to his [[aspie|goon]] customers and [[Lowtax|boss]]. 

Radium was quite possibly the most incompetent sysadmin ever, as demonstrated by frequent downtime and [[Banhammer|chimpouts]] whenever it was brought to light.  If [[Lowtax]] weren't so buzzed on [[Oxycontin|oxy]] all the time, he'd probably have noticed and pretended to fire him much sooner. Because he is the [[Mexican|cheapest]] coder Lowtax knows, he remains an admin at SA as [[faggot|GENERIC ADMINISTRATOR]] to the detriment of everyone else.

After the [[Something Awful#The Great SA forum account hack of 2008 and the Ultimate Lowtax meltdown|Great Hack Attack]], [[Lowtax]] and Radium rapidly tried to shift blame of the password leak onto the [[goon]] customers. It was ''[[Lie|their fault]]'' that the passwords were in the hands of HUAI and [[SASS]] because goons were using insecure passwords and using them on third-party warez sites, and the SA Admins weren't going to be held responsible for it. In the name of great justice, [[SASS]] poster FanglyMan on a whim decided to try "GENERIC ADMINISTRATOR"'s hilariously insecure SA password ( '''k'''enneth '''j s'''tumpf '''500''') on a credit rating forum to confirm if it was him. It worked. For the [[lulz]], [[SASS]] immediently started punching "kjs500" in everything they could possibly find. What they found:

* Radium is paid $42k a year for his amateur hackwork on SA.
* Complete access to Radium's ISP management account.
* Complete access to Radium's PayPal account.
* Complete access to Radium's eBay account.
* Radium's tropical fish account. 

Rather then use all this to utterly destroy Radium's life, [[SASS]] magnanimously decided [[DO_IT_FAGGOT|not]] to destroy Stumpf's life, stopping at just his reputation. Radium eventually had to come clean on the forums, tell Lowtax to shut the fuck up about third-party bullshit and explain that yeah, [[O RLY?|someone managed to crack SA's database]]. Despite all of the above, he is still responsible for [[Oh exploitable|the security of tens of thousands of goons' credit card numbers]]. Lowtax responded by having an emotional meltdown on the forums and handing the keys to Fragmaster, confirming ultimate [[SASS]] victory.

==Titan==
Back in the year 2000, when the Something Awful Forums were migrated to the vBulletin forum software, [Lowtax decided that no forum software package available at the time had the power to handle SA's traffic. As a result, he commissioned radium to write a new piece of software from the ground up with the intention of retiring vBulletin and moving to the new package (which was to be named Titan). Even now, 8 years later, Titan is still officially in development. 

Titan has become a running joke at SASS because it highlights what a braggart radium really was, despite his general inability to do anything properly and lack of following through on his promises.
