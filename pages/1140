[[Image:Bhn00dz1.jpg|thumb|right|His [[ass]].]]

'''Brandon Hilton''', or '''Brandon Barnett''' before the faggot got his name UNofficially changed, is a [[faggot]] [[Chris Crocker]] wannabe [[attention whore]] and [[fail]]ed [[MySpace celebrity]] from the fabulous state of [[Redneck|South Carolina.]] [[Shemale|He]] thinks he's [[hawt]] and continually has new [[porn|modeling photos]] taken of him posing like the other [[homosexual]] he's imitating, [[Jeffree Star]]. Brandon Hilton's most recent mission is to try to upset [[Fred Phelps]] and the [[God hates fags]] crowd. However, since Hilton can do nothing but produce [[internets]] faggotry, and Phelps is only slightly younger than [[God]] itself, his mission is [[dead]]er than your average [[The An Heroes of Bridgend|Welsh emo kid]]. Hilton is reported to [[serious business|care a lot about his internet reputation]], which he has done a fantastic job of playing up.

IRL FACTS:

He currently resides in Fort Worth, Texas and works at North Park Mall in Dallas.

Most of his songs are dubbed Armin van Buuren rip-offs.

Brandon self-released his own n00dz - all 4.5 inches for imaginary fans at www.justusboys.com

There is a picture of him with Paris Hilton - what he fails to mention is: along with the $20 cover-charge at a Dallas, TX nightclub, Paris was taking pictures with the first 200 people in the door.
==[[Friendwhore|Friendwhoring]] Faggotry==

Brandon Hilton has [[over 9000|thousands]] of [[pedophile|MySpace "friends"]]. While most of these are [[16-year-old girl]]s and [[transsexual]] [[fucktard]]s, some others are Hilton's [[sockpuppet]]s he made solely for the purpose of being an attention whore. He [[Ripper|thinks he's hardcore]] because he claims he'll delete people from his friendlist who don't talk, which is a [[lie]] designed to make people [[comment whore|comment him]].

==[[Internet model]]ing Faggotry==

[[Image:Bhmoarcopyingfail.jpg|thumb|right|Brandon Hilton is a [[internet model|real model]].]]

Brandon Hilton has a [[fetish]] for taking modeling pictures. It's a common symptom of [[internet disease]] that manifests itself [[IRL]] once the infected person walks away from their mirror or their camera phone battery dies. Hilton traveled to [[Florida]], the [[cock]] of the [[United States]], to have modeling pictures taken of him. He apparently thinks that posing with cotton candy is sexy, when all it does is further highlight how much of a [[lol-cow]] he is. He also modeled for a [[PETA|terrorist organization]], and is a friendwhore on [[ModelMayhem]].

Like all good [[faggot|famous gays]], Brandon Hilton has tried his hand at a makeup line. Of course, he thinks that people will buy it because of his incessant [[SSP]]. It is made from 100% [[AIDS|all]] [[cum|natural]] [[shit|ingredients]] and is thus toxic. [[Some argue]] contact with it can cause [[homosexuality|spider expertise]].

==[[Music]]al Faggotry==
A self-proclaimed "musician," Hilton offers on his many myspace pages his "art" for everyone's consumption. The stark beats and minimal compositions are well-complemented by his voice, which â€” actually it's predictably crap. Watering down the already diluted electronic music genre, he posts generic weak techno beats, already overused synth programs, and vocals that are so [[Tom O C|autotuned]] that T-pain himself would weep. Essentially there is absolutely no talent involved, the loops are likely all out of the box and the lyrics are more or less him describing various acts of gay sex. His crowning musical achievement, however, would have to be labeling a song as an acoustic version when it contains not a single acoustic instrument. [[Buttsecks|Among other things]] he is [[Lie|constantly partying with other performers and collaborating with acts such as Lady GaGa.]] Because we all know how much time [[Dickgirl|Lady GaGa]] has for a [[Internet celebrity|big-time celebrity]] such as Mr. Hilton. 

{{quote|My bootyhole... my bootyhole... my bootyhole...|"My Bootyhole"|yes, he looped a sample talking about his filthy browneye}}

==[[Drama]], [[TL;DR]], and other [[crap]]==

Brandon is known for posting [[TL;DR]] MySpace bulletins about the [[drama]] he invents, to try to [[USI|make himself think someone actually gives a shit about him]]. The amount of [[fail]] in these bulletins is extreme. It is unlikely that anyone has actually read all the way through one of these bulletins since they are so pathetic.

{{co|qwerty|[OH GOD MAKE IT STOP]|[DRAMA CONTAINED WITHIN]|0|Subject:  I'M HUMAN TOO........ gossip, my nudes, drama, WHY?  
Body:  Ok so there are a few things that I need to address, I just havent had the time to sit down and actually type it all out.

So Here Goes:

1 - my music is now on iTunes, a stupid person once told me that my music was shit, and I'd never be considered a real artist, until my music was on iTunes.
I'd love to see their face right about NOW!

2 - I'm in Stephen Bryant's new music video for his song - TOY SOLDIER that comes out on Dec. 1st on Logo and will be played in American Eagle stores over the Holidays. It's super exciting for me, and was awesome working with him and the crew.... I cant tell you what I do in the video, but its super skanky, super amazing, and super controversial.. This video will [[fellatio|blow]] Katy Perry out of the water.

[[Scene|RAWR!]]
and now on to the business side of things.

Ok last night, I wrote a very very long bulletin addressing everything thats going on in my life right now. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about...

When I posted the bulletin, it [[cock|flopped]] and it didn't post... what a waste of an hour... but here goes again...

I'm not depressed at all, so don't think that.

My life is peachy fucking keen. My dreams are coming true, and my plans are finally going into motion to produce a product that I am finally pleased with.

I have molded the Brandon Hilton image like putty for 2 years now, and its finally coming together to be something profitable and successful.

BUT MORE THAN THAT, I've become a [[Whore|Role Model]]. and [[Pedophile|an Icon to teens and youth]]. AND THATS WHAT REALLY COUNTS.

Thinking back 2 years ago, I never saw any of this coming. NONE OF IT.. honestly I think it may have even been a joke to me at first.

But it was something I wanted to happen, and really wanted to try and achieve, and I def. made my dreams a reality.

On to the POINT...

Lately it seems like every where I turn someone is out to get me, or use me, or be me, or steal from me, or hate me for no reason. Every time I log on, theres [[at least 100|100]] messages asking me if I've read so and so's blog about me, or the latest TABLOID GOSSIP LIE on a stupid website.

I dont have time to sit around and google myself anymore. That was fun a year ago, but now I'm actually busy, and have a life, and a real carreer.
I AM a professional model, and people can joke around all they want, b/c 1 year ago, I def was not. BUT AM NOW PAYED TO DO IT... Am now scouted out on websites to be in video's, shoots, covers, the face of my own cosmetic line.

And people cant take that away from me. THEY CANT DENY that I'm becoming one of the most photographed people on the Internet with the exception of like 2 people and Audrey Kitching. People cant deny that my dreams are finally becoming a reality.

But with that success, and with that "(fame)" comes more haters, and more negativity. And thats becoming hard to handle. It doesnt hurt b/c NONE OF IT IS TRUE.... Its all bullshit thought up by jealous [[gay]]s who wish they were as [[poor|successful]] and [[goatse|attractive]] as I am... ITS THE TRUTH... They have no reaosn to hate me, NO ONE DOES.... I dont set out to hurt anyone, I keep to myself, I am friendly and nice to EVERYONE. I have a huge heart, TOO BIG MOST OF THE TIME... and I guess thats what people take advantage of.

..FOR EXAMPLE -.. I walked and performed in a Fashion Show on Sunday night, and one of the models called my friend who sponsored and planned the show, and got herself added to the show, but she talked alot of shit about me, and told her that I was bad to work with, and was mean to people (keep in mind she is telling all of this to one of my REALLY good friends!) etc. etc. BUT THEN.... when the girl came to the show, and got in hair and makeup, and actually talked to me, and got to know me, she realized that I was nothing like those people wrote that I was. THOSE PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW ME.... Have never met me, so how in the hell can they say how I am. THEY DONT KNOW ME... 

The point of that was, Me and her talked, and she discovered that [[lie|nothing you read about me is true]].

and whats worse.

Its pisses me off to know that my 12, 13 and 14 year old fans, can stumble upon that non-sense, and read it and potentially be altered by lies and bullshit. Their minds are still impressionable they are still developing, they are in super fragile times of their lives.

And to read something like that about your Role Model, or [[American Idol|Idol]], and even someone you like in general can be mentally disturbing. AND FOR IT TO BE A BUNCH OF LIES... and for me to think that I could potentially lose an amazing fan over a fucking lie DISTURBS ME...

I'd hate to think that people as a whole are that ignorant, and I cant help but wonder why the idiots writing all that shit are so pathetic that they need to hate on people who are simply living out dreams and doing what they've always wanted to do.

For all the time it takes to research and make up lies about me and post them, you could be doing something with your own life.

Hate gives you wrinkles, and I dont have time or money for botox!

It just builds and builds and builds until you finally SNAP! and I really needed to vent and address these things.... IT BOTHERS ME...

Like I said, NOT B/C ANY OF ITS TRUE... b/c its all bullshit.. BUT BECAUSE ITS WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO HATE ME FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN [[Lie|JEALOUSY OF MY SUCCESS]]....

I never once called myself FAMOUS, everyone else did... and then it kinda happened...

AND ON THAT NOTE!

Some pretty revealing pictures of me have leaked on to the internet, on several stupid pathetic blog sites, ran by several stupid pathetic people.

And everyone keeps asking me "WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT?"

and this is my answer.....

When you love someone, sometimes you do stupid things for them to make them happy, and when I travel for a living, sometimes I cant always be with the person who I loved.

That person missed holding me, kissing me, touching me, loving me, and I took those pics simply b/c I loved that person in return. And he asked me too.

At the time I was no where near as popular as I am now, at the time, I never once considered the pics to be a big deal, or that ANYTHING like this would happen. and at the time I didnt really care b/c I loved that person.

But when people go their seperate ways, sometimes things like that come back to haunt you, and when that person realized he could get fame, money, or even promotion by giving the pics out. He didnt once reconsider stooping as low as to post them.

I think everyone knows by now that I am not as low as any of my haters, I rarely even name them, and rarely ever attack back simply b/c I dont have the time, and dont really CARE ABOUT THEM...

But what this person did HURTS, and it doesnt hurt b/c of everyone's ability to see the pics. B/c lets face it, I have an amazing body, and an amazing piece. I'm not ashamed at all..

What hurts is the fact that I loved someone, and whether we were still together or not that person betrayed that trust, and tried to hurt me by posting something like that.

I'm a [[internet model|MODEL]].
maybe you missed that, I walk around NAKED for a living, it was bound to happen eventually. But I didnt expect it to happen b/c of someone I loved by fame or money hungry.. I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO ANYONE....

[[BAWWW|and thats what hurts..]]

So when you ask how I feel... I'M [[butthurt|HURT]]... and what do I have to say about it? I SAY THAT I'M SORRY PEOPLE AS A WHOLE ARE THAT PATHETIC...

and to the people who run those pathetic sites... "F YOU!" you got the biggest, most commented and controversial story that you probably EVER will... ENJOY IT! you'll be shut down soon...

And the people who run the site are simply pathetic losers anyway, who constantly write a new post about me every other day, b/c they are jealous of my success, beauty, and talent.. KEEP POSTING.. and I'll keep laughing..

You'll never knock me down, b/c when you look up, THERE I WILL BE.... on your conputer screen, your TV screen, in your magazines.. and I'll NEVER STOP!

whats even funnier as how half of them have tried to add me on myspace, saying they are sorry and blah blah blah... and I just love the face that I have to approve my requests..

b/c the DENY button is a beautiful thing...

LOVE YOU GUYS...

I hope this answered all of your questions..
I DONT WANT A PITTY PARTY FROM ANYONE...
I just needed to vent, and tell everyone how I was feeling.

and what I was REALLY going through.

This month has been one of the best and worst ones of my entire life.. I've lost alot of people that I loved, been hurt by some of the people closest to me, but gained alot. Knowledge, Power, Success, and even more AMAZING new friends... Jen, Shea, Von, Nick, Gary, and everyone else... I LOVE YOU ALL..

- BH
xoxoxo

[[Comment whore|PLEASE LEAVE COMMENTS ONLY!]]

I cant respond to messages right now...

I just would like everyone to know. HOW I FEEL for once... people always attack, but they never stop to think how people would actually feel if the same thing were done to them..}}


Needless to say, Brandon's [[faggot]] [[fanboi]]s were pleased to hear about his [[n00dz]] being leaked, and [[over 9000]] of them collectively drooled at the sight of his [[pro-ana|manorexic]] body and [[shock image|gross]] [[cock]].

[[Image:Brandonlovesmatt.jpg|thumb|<s>[[Rich and beautiful|I don't care to be called a fag]]</s> This was once an amusing [[MSPaint|Photoshop]]ped image clearly created and used "for purposes such as criticism", but once more some tool abused the law to have it removed.]]

LOL [[B&]]

==[[Troll]]ing==

[[Image:Bh2g1c.jpg|thumb|right|Brandon Hilton meets [[2girls1cup]].]]

[[Anonymous]] has been trolling Brandon Hilton on the Jew Tubes [[for great justice]]. Most of the videos have been [[baleet]]ed (as was Brandon), but some have remained.

[[WTF]] h4x? Moderate [[fail]].

You can troll his SayNow account here: 214-989-4691 and leave him loving messages = BH& lolz

==[[Homosexuality|Gay?]]==
Brandon "Hilton" Barnett went to Gettys D. Broome High School in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Many who remember Brandon before the days of [[Bullshit|internet glamour]] remember him as either a [[Liar|"fake gay,"]] who simply used [[homosexuality|"his sexuality"]] as a ruse to make girls comfortable around him so he could fondle, and in the case of a rumored one or two, [[Fuck|fuck,]] or at least make-out with them, or they remember him in the earlier high school years and later middle school as [[not gay|completely straight,]] lashing out at others for doing things that seem girly or [[homosexuality|gay.]] Even his own sister is unsure. 

Local gay men who had dated him described him as a "tease." [[Captain Obvious|It's entirely possible his entire internet persona is just an image he's projecting to gain attention.]] IT'S A COMPLETELY NEW CONCEPT!!!


IRL CONFIRMED: Every Tuesday he attends the gay bar, JR's Bar & Grill in Dallas, Texas "New-Comers" drag show with drag-wannabe Morgan Von Dee - itself being a drag-queen who works at Burger King as a cashier by day.
==BAWWWWW DEFAMATION BAWWWWW==
Some faggot by the name of Matthew Nalett who promotes awful music wants to eliminate anything informing the masses of how Brandon acts when he is not producing [[Olga Roll|ear-rape material]].  Unsuccessfully blanking this article, he believes that [[lie|we are reasonable people]] and will simply remove this horrible "defamation of character" or let him remove it himself.  After being b&, he subscribed to the ED mailing list and sent out the following e-mail:

{{squote|Dear Sysop's
Hello i had removed all the Defamation of Character for Brandon Hilton on The Website and i was blocked by Raspberry Rush. Can you unblock me below thanks. My nickname is NewMusicPromote i own 2 music networks in chicago and deal with [[fail|talent]].  Your current IP address is '''[[Ddos|24.148.57.169]]''', and the block ID is #40530|Matthew|asking for it}}

However, not content with just attracting the attention of the mailing list, he even decided to pay a lovely visit to [[ED IRC]] and bitch to the sysops for a second time.  Knowing the potential [[lulz|energy]] of the situation, he was happily invited to [[Arbchat]] to present his case before the ED High Council and Honour [[Weev]].  Unfortunately for him, he did not hire an attorney at lol and believed he knew the law.  Matthew was given two options, which were donating a small amount of jewgold or having one of his artists create a song about ED.  Some even offered to help him with the lyrics.  Matthew refused both, essentially putting the final nail in the coffin.  He was assraped and the High Council ruled that Matthew loves dicks.

Crying to mommy when daddy doesn't give you what you want, Matthew made a phone call the next morning to the company that hosts ED and gave one unfortunate employee the same bitchfest that caused his Arbchat session to go down the shitter and end up in this article.  Like Brandon's attempt at music, Matthew's plan failed.

If either side has learned anything, it is that [[Streisand Effect|this page would have never been article of the now if he had shut the fuck up]]. In fact at one point this article was tagged as {{tname|shit}}.
