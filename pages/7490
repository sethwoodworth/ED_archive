== History ==

The first known usage of the card was by Per [[Yngwie Malmsteen|Yngve]] [[Irony|"Dead"]] Ohlin during the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Black Metal|Mayhem]] tournament in 1991. This was the first recorded usage of the card and it instantly won him [[The Game]]. It is believed he stole Shotgun Mouthwash from his bandmate Euronymous, who was [[pwned|killed]] two years later by Varg Vikernes in an attempt to take the card. However, Varg was disappointed to learn that Euronymous no longer had Shotgun Mouthwash and that nobody knew of its whereabouts.

Shotgun Mouthwash was next seen at Seattle's Mega Battle Arena Competition in 1994, when it was played by [[Kurt Cobain]].  That card was so powerful that he automatically won the competition despite only playing the card in the second round.  Both Kurt and the card have been missing ever since.

== Bootleg Market ==
Bootlegs of Shotgun Mouthwash have been available online through [[LiveJournal]], [[Vampirefreaks]] and [[Irc]].  Despite repeated attempts by the authorities, the spread of these bootlegged cards has been overwhelming. The real version of the card was recently scanned and placed on DeviantART [http://mikaharuhara.deviantart.com/art/Shotgun-Mouthwash-73552473 here]

== Rumors of Its Current Location ==
Only the ambiguous phrase "John" has been validated in relation to the card's present location. [[Some_argue|Some believe]] KoRn frontman Jonathan Davis now owns the card and is planning to use it soon. This is a popular opinion because Davis is probably butthurt that [[Slipknot]] is [[Pwning|selling more records than]] KoRn. In 2004 it was speculated that [[John Kerry]] possessed it and would use it after election day if [[W]] got more votes. Still others believe that Courtney Love lost the card while blowing johns in an alley for drug money.

At Halloween [[2007]] some [[punk]] kids decided they wanted to [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] summon shotgun mouthwash on inanimate objects while listening to Marilyn Manson. They made videos on it and posted them on YouTube. Obviously, this caused a load of brick-shitting and got banned by YouTube.
