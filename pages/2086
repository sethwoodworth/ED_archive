'''David Duchovny''' is a low budget porn actor best known for his role in the Nothing-Else-On-At-1AM-But-It's-This-Or-Fap-To-The-[[Billy Mays|Kaboom-Commercial]] show ''The [[Put Shoe On Head|Red Shoe]] Diaries''. On the last day of August 2008 it came to light that he was a rampaging [[sick fuck|sexaholic]] who [[fuck|fucked]] all the beautiful out of Gillian Anderson with his insatiable [[cock|meatmallet]] leaving her a dried up scarecrow in the new ''X-Files'' movie, and pregnant with [[Chris-chan|alien]] babies. He is also the [[BFF]] of proto-[[placentafag]] [[Jason Beghe|Jason Be Gay.]]

It seems /d/avid has a condition which makes him unable to stop fapping it to internet prons. According to a study by people who [[Bill Nye|happen to be experts on this subject]] called - and once again, ED is not making this shit up - The Mayo Clinic, "Symptoms range from rampant promiscuity to spending hours looking at pornography and using sex to escape from problems such as depression or stress. It is often accompanied by secrecy and shame, and sufferers have difficulties with emotional intimacy."

The entirety of [[Anonymous]] is said to be putting in a claim for Disability benefit, possibly with a view to suing [[Al Gore]].

So, who will convince poor old Agent Faps Harder that porn is not, in fact, [[awesome]]? Good question. One possible solution proposed to stop Duchovny is to have him deported to England - where they prefer a nice cup of tea - before he sleeps his way as far as ''Heroes'' or (God forbid) ''Battlestar Galactica''. Here, the potential for collateral damage will be limited to [[Doctor Who|time-traveling MILFs.]]
