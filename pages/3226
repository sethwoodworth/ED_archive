Garden State
[[Image:Johndorian.gif|thumb|150px|Stoned.]]

1. A shitty movie about a nobody [[luser]] who takes an incredible amount of ecstacy before freaking out and hallucinating that he has a [[woman|GF]].  However, he is such a [[luser]] that even his [[Natalie Portman|imaginary girlfriend]] rejects him and the final 45 minutes of the movie are just him crying sweet [[emo]] tears. [[Some argue]] that given Garden State's central theme —[[Israel|homecoming]]— and the [[fact]] that its star-writer-director-fuckhead [[Zach Braff]] is a kike, the movie's actual agenda is [[judaism]]. 


2. A shitty state-wide [[New Jersey|dumpster]] full of nobody [[luser]]s who take incredible amounts of ecstacy before freaking out and hallucinating that they have GFs.
