Crossover
[[File:SuperMarioBrosZ.png|thumb|Typical fandom crossover.]]

'''Crossovers''' are a genre of media in which two fictional universe are joined in order to combine settings, plots, and characters. Professionals use this medium to great success in game series such as ''Marvel vs. Capcom'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''. Unfortunately, some amateurs who don't have any business writing stories often use crossovers in [[fanfiction]], [[hentai]], and artwork.

A common element in crossovers is pairings. For some reason, characters from two or more different series are made into rivals. For other reasons, characters from multiple series [[Shipping|are made into lovers]].

As with most fanfics, crossover exist as the result of fanfic writers attempting to live out their [[fantasies]] through fiction. These writers want to experience a world where fictional universes collide, and they want to take credit for putting those fantasies on paper.
