'''Jew''', who was born [[at least 100 years ago]] but is immortal due to his natural "cures", is a successful [[scam]] artist.  Flip on your TV to a number of channels past 10pm and you can find him selling something, but not for money to buy more mansions, but for the greater good of [[people|the people]].  He is a convicted felon; convicted of larceny, credit card fraud, check fraud, and [[rape]].  He has also been charged large fines by the [[FTC]] on numerous occasions.  He thinks that the drug companies are all out to get him and are "attacking" him via the media. <s>Also, he is a fucking [[Scientology|Sci-Fag]].</s> Also he's not a [[Scientology|Sci-Fag]] but he has been exposed to Scientology.
