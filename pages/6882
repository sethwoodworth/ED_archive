'''Realm-Of-The-Shadows''' is a [[fundamentalist|Protestant]] [[fuckwit]] and a [[Nazi]], and hates [[Catholic]]s, as he believes them to be '''fish-worshipping [[satanist]]s''' and [[Illuminati|Freemasons]]. He enjoys drawing lots of fail and preaching his [[batshit insane]] [[shit nobody cares about|views]] to his little [[friends|fuck buddies]], such as [[DBoyWheeler]] and [[Sonicrocksmysocks]]. He is delusional and seems to think he rules over some kind of [[Duke Otterland|imaginary kingdom]], as evidenced by his [[retard]]ed username. His love of 'God' comes in second only to "the best in anime and manga ever!".

== A Totally Superior History of ROTS ==

=== Kansas and ROTS ===
Kansas, home to flaming homosexuals, potatoes and coon prick. Also, though not an often-discussed fact, Kansas holds the largest density per-square-mile of [[retarded]], [[racist]], [[inbred]], [[gay|homophobic]], [[batshit insane]] [[paranoid|conspiracy-theorist]] hillbillies known on the planet. Kansas holds many dark secrets in its fields. ''Many'' dark secrets. 

One of the dark secrets Kansas holds is ROTS, who once occupied Kansas, or rather, its ''fields'' rather than its houses, since the [[FBI|Totalitarian United States Government Illuminati Service]] have hundreds if not thousands of spy satellites in the fabricated propaganda tool known as ''space'' in geostationary orbit watching over every citizen in Kansas through their walls. It was in these fields that ROTS was raised until the vigorous age of 34 where he left the fields to warn the world of the perils and lies of the government. 

==== Prolonged Effects of Corn ====

During his prolonged stay in the fields of Kansas, ROTS was subjected to mind altering corn, found the only book of [[lies|truth]] and contracted [[AIDS]] after being consensually raped by a [[redneck|tractor]] after he mistook it for a ''pure'' virgin Christian tractor, which might explain his homophobia and his complete devotion to the ''true law''. 

It might also because of the corn that ROTS (mistaking them for visions from God) somehow received a direct dream feed during [[Japan|Weeaboo Central]] TV, which might explain his ability to speak the language of the moon. 

== Super Duper [[Weeaboo]] Powers!!!!111ONELEVEN ==
[[Image:Rotslanguagerape.jpg|thumb|Native speakers, beware!]]

Realm-Of-Shit made up a [[Wapanese]] name for himself, [[Wapanese|Kazuma]] [[Narutard|Mikage]]. As if that wasn't enough [[animu]] shit for you, he also pretends to know Japanese by writing it on his [[crap|art]]. When people correct his butchering of the language, he of course throws a fucking hissy fit, complete with empty [[banhammer]] threats.

He also has a running list of which animes and mangas are ok for his [[cult|imaginary subjects]]. Basically his only criteria for something to be good is for it to be [[animu]]. However, if it has [[gay]]s in it, watch out! It will be relegated to the (and I quote) '''"OFFICIAL ANIME AND MANGA BLACKLIST OF THE REALM"[[oneoneone|!!1]]'''

Realm-Of-The-Shadows has also been known to post photographs of his [[shit nobody cares about|amazing collection]] of [[otaku]] [[crap]], in what can only be interpreted as some misguided attempt at being [[lame|sugoi]].  The photos are complete with [[OCD|post-it notes describing his collection]], as well as [[basement dweller|parental basement scenery]].

=== Run-Of-The-Mill Career Aspirations ===
Like any good [[Wapanese]], Realm-Of-Shit wants to move to [[Japan]] and become a famous mangaka. Little does he know that the Japanese mostly practice Shinto and [[Buddha|Buddhism]] and not his [[Christianity|one true religion]].  Here is his creative philosophy:

{{quote|And DESPITE my mental shortcomings of not thinking before i speak, i SHALL carry my ambition and resolve to use anime to inspire to the grave fulfilled and completed in all it was created to accomplish(by my hand of course) God bless you to ALL who show support!|Realm-Of-The-Shadows, on his mental shortcomings}}

If your response was [[WTF]], then there's a good chance you're not [[retarded]].

== Realm-Of-The-Shadows's [[HUEG]] Ego ==
Realm-Of-The-Suck thinks he is the best thing that has ever happened to the open [[internets]]. He honestly believes his art is [[Chasethehedgehog|in the top 10%]] of all art in the world and that he is a better artist than people such as [http://banzchan.deviantart.com/ Banzchan] ([[LOL]]). As such, he has no qualms about asking people to watch him, asking people for money, and waving around his completely [[fact]]ual statements about everything.

In the event that someone totally [[pwn|hands him his ass]], he will hide their comments and block them because, deep down inside, he is really a [[pussy]].

== Pope [[tinfoil hat|Hat]] [[Conspiracy|Conspiracies]] and Other [[Shit nobody cares about|Delusions]] ==
According to the following [[fact|irrefutable]] [[proof]], all Catholics are really [[Arab|Babylonians]] who like fish and probably also liek [[mudkips]] a little [[in the ass|too much]]. This is the type of [[angst|airing of grievances]] you would likely expect from [[fundie]]s like Retard-Of-The-Shadows. However, it is [[ironic]] that the Pope's hat/Catholics-are-evil [[conspiracy]] is of utmost importance, while [[titties]] are perfectly ok and featured everywhere in his art. Retard-Of-The-Shadows must think that [[Jesus]] and [[God]] approve of [[titties]] more than fish hats. Their opinion of [[mudkips]] is yet unknown, but it probably says somewhere in the [[Bible]] that [[God]] and [[Jesus]] liek them.

This, by the way, is not a single journal entry, but '''only part''' of the footer on '''every single one of his journal entries'''. Talk about [[tl;dr]].

Links on the journal:

=== [[Illuminati]]think ===

{{warning|Realm-Of-The-Shadows will [[unwarranted self importance|crush you beneath his foot]] like he does to the devil everyday!}}
In addition to his pope hat conspiracy theory, Realm-Of-Fail believes in the [[faggottry|Gay Agenda]], that Satan is a real person (he is, in fact, a [[furry]]), and that by being an annoying prick he can stop these things from taking over the world. 

Anything that Realm-Of-Crap dislikes or disagrees with is a tool of (insert some other name of Satan here). Someone doesn't like your shitty art? TOOL OF TEH DEVIL!!!1 Unpopped popcorn kernels? THEY ARE BEING CONTROLLED BY SATAN!!!1 [[Yaoi]] in your [[animu]]? TEH WORK OF BEELZEBUB[[oneoneone|!!!!11ONE]]

== Epic Journal Event ==
[[Image:ROTS_someonecallthewaaaambulance.jpg|thumb|150px|We'll rue the day we "dragged his name through the mud"? lol wut?]].]]
Retard-Of-The-Shadows almost instantly discovered this page and immediately proceeded to write a [[crybaby]] journal entry calling for the intervention of an [[e-lawyer]]. After a day of high-profile [[lulz]] facilitated by his journal's #1 place on the devianTART Today page, it appears Fucktard-Of-The-Shadows has decided to [[GTFO]] the [[internets]] for a little while. Faced with extreme [[butthurt]], Fucktard-Of-The-[[Faggotry]] has deleted all his journals and [[art]] and has seemingly abdicated as lord of the Realm-Of-The-Shadows. 

In his quest to find an [[e-lawyer]] and to pursue an [[internet lawsuit]], Retard-Of-The-Shadows went through many stages of lulz, starting with a hissy fit and the calling of [[waaaambulance]]s and ending finally with him receiving some truly epic spamming on his userpage and journal.

== His Art (LOL) ==
Made mostly of [[fail]] and [[AIDS]], Retard-Of-The-Shadows's [[art]] is [[shitty]] [[animu]] with some [[ripoff]] and a dash of tracing. Since Retard-Of-The-Shadows is incapable of creativity and other forms of higher thought, he just takes art from old series with large [[hentai]] caches, such as [[Evangelion]], edits it a little, and slaps some [[God]] on it to make it [[shit|his own]]. He has been reported as an art thief, though a final verdict on this has not yet been reached.

When given critique, he makes an excuse for it such as "I like it this way" instead. Since his art is mostly tracings from "How to Draw Anime" books, he can't go and do shit on his own. In some ways, he is similar to [[Snapesnogger]] since he does not take critique very well.

Color is not part of his vocabulary, as evidenced by [[at least 100]] [[crap]] doodles in his gallery. On the occasions where he remembers that [[art]] is usually supposed to have colors in it, he uses [[Photoshop]] and Illustrator to make eye-nukes with 255 red, green, and blue.

</gallery>

=== Supposed Upcoming Series ===
Retard-Of-The-Shadows draws the same 2 or 3 characters all the time. He continuously talks about some [[Epic Fail Guy|epic]] story he's been making for [[at least 100|10 years]] and plans on working on it for another 5 like it's going to be the next [[Lord of the Rings]] or something. Unfortunately, Retard-Of-The-Shadows is a 20-something uncreative [[fundie|Jesustard]] office bitch, rather than a linguistics professor at Oxford. When confronted with the high levels of [[fail]] in his characters and story so far, he mentioned [[Dragonball Z]]. This of course proves that the quality level of his story will be well [[over 9000]].

=== Characters ===
==== Protagonists ====
[[Image:Kazuma.jpg|thumb|100px|ROTS in mecha cosplay.|left]]







;Kazuki/Kazuma/Ryuusei: His [[self-insert]] character that has no personality, a constantly changing name, and some kind of magical armor suit. He's supposed to be the main protagonist, but he really has no point. A good example of a [[Mary Sue|Gary Stu]].







[[Image:Ainadoingjackshit.jpg|thumb|100px|Skill(s): crying, tits.|left]]








;Aina: A whiny little [[cunt]], Aina is Kazuma's girlfriend/wife. She has no point at all except to stand around and cry all the time because she can't do jack shit.

==== Antagonists ====
[[Image:Mkgandhi.gif|thumb|100px|Clearly, the epitome of evil.|left]]





;Gandhi: Retard-Of-The-Shadows believes that peace can only be achieved by war, much like virginity can only be achieved by [[fuck]]ing. This, as well as the fact that Retard-Of-The-Shadow is a [[racist]], makes Gandhi a [[terrorist]]. This character is killed off by some unspecified character named [[Vegeta|Vegandarae]].








[[Image:Akuma.jpg|thumb|100px|We should fear not the apocalypse, but the textwalling that will come with it.|left]]





;Akuma: Satan. The generic supervillan-type badguy. Also a badass cd by the japanese noise band Boris.

Coincidentally, it appears that Satan ''also'' grew up in Kansas, because he uses inbred yokel grammatical constructions such as "I do it so well that I don't get hardly any credit for it".

=== Plot ===
See [[Bible]].
