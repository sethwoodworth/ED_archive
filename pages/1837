'''Creepy''' is a word that most [[teenager]]s would use to describe what it's like to watch their [[parents]] have wild, steamy [[buttsecks]].  In other words, creepy is [[frienditto|traumatizing]], [[ohbutyouwillpet|disturbing]], and lulzy.

==Creepiness [[OTI]]==
The internet is truly the home of creepy.  Thanks to its [[Anonymous|anonymity]], just about [[fucking everyone|everyone]] on it is the [[IRL]] equivalent of the guy standing next to a dark alley with his hoodie pulled over his face, ready to snatch n' [[rape]].  The [[MSN]] [[chat rooms]] are a deep well of creepiness, as all the [[16 year old girl]]s in ~xT33N CH4T!!x~ are notorious for being [[srsly]] old men.  [[4chan]] [[/b/]] is the true creepiness Singularity of the internet.  Just ask [[Cracky-chan]].

==Creepiness [[IRL]]==
Creeps in the real world are easier to find than [[pedophile]]s at your kid's pool party.  Just join the [[NAMBLA|Boy Scouts]], and you'll find all the creepiness you'll ever need.

[[You]] are no doubt a complete fucking creep.  Girls do not like it when you stare at their [[tits]] and say "yeeeeeessssss."  [[Loser]].
