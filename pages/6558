[[Image:Furstress.jpg|thumb|PTSD]]

<i>Not to be confused with [[PMS]] - which is far more horrifying to experience and even more horrifying to witness.</i>

==Causes of PTSD==
Like most [[disorder]]s, there is a legitimate form and a [[bullshit|less legitimate]] form. Although this being the internet, there is no way to fucking tell.

===Legitimate Reasons To Have PTSD===

[[Some argue]] these are [[IRL]] reasons to pull out your own hair and eat it. [[Anonymous|Others]] are inflicted with a sense of sadism and feel that the fact these were real events, which happened to real people and left them badly traumatized is funny. Who can blame them?

<!-- 
THESE ARE ACTUAL REASONS OKAY STOP BREAKING THE JOKE, NOBODY GETS PTSD FROM VIEWING UNCYCLOPEDIA 
-->
* [[Ohbutyouwillpet|Molested]]
* [[Raped]]
* [[Murder]]ed
* [[Japan|Nuked]] or [[Iraq|bombed]]
* Served in [[Vietnam]], [[World War I]] or [[World War II]], [[Iraq]] maybe [[Korea]]
* [[Kill it with fire|Burn victim]]
* [[Prison]] [[Bubba|experience]]
* [[Erectile dysfunction]]
* [[Drunk|Victim of tragic car accident]]

===Less Legitimate Reasons To Have PTSD===

As though being raped, blown up or somehow mutilated was not funny enough there are plenty of people who haven't been traumatized but like to pretend they have been. For some reason they think this means they will receive sympathy. They have clearly not been on the internet for long.

* [[Chris-chan]] claims his life is stressful.  It consists of: not working as he lives off welfare and spending all day just slacking off.

== Prevalence ==

[[Image:patriot.jpg|thumb|right|A Known cause of Post Traumatic Stress]]

Although between 50-90% of people experience trauma in their life, only about 8% of these people will get PTSD (this are fact because it's on [[Wikipedia]]).

The people most likely to get PTSD are:

* Mexicans ([[Wikipedia:Post-traumatic_stress_disorder#Risk_and_protective_factors_for_PTSD_development|seriously]])
* [[John McCain|War veterans]]
* Boys and girls who Daddy loved just [[Incest|a little too much.]]

== Related Disorders ==

===Survivor Syndrome===

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder meets [[Godwin's Law]]. The survivors of so-called "[[concentration camp]]s" exhibited strange behavior such as [[depression]], nightmares and guilt. Clearly they must have some bizarre disorder unknown to [[science]] which cannot be readily explained.

=== Acute Stress Reaction ===

When the body brings itself to the brink of death for no apparent reason. The patient does not have any form of [[mental illness]] or any existing neuroses; [[Fibromyalgia|the body's system simply overreacts]].

''Possible causes: [[God hates fags|God hates you]].''

===Emotional Dysregulation===

Screaming, [[cutting]] and threatening to commit [[suicide]] over a broken plate or some shit. It is better known by  it's official [[DSM|DSM-IV-TR]] title: ''chronic [[butthurt]] [[attention whore]] [[emo]] [[faggotry]] disorder''.
