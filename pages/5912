OS-tan
__NOTOC__
[[Image:Ostan xp dat ass.jpg|frameless|right|150px|DAT ASS]]
When one becomes the lowest form of a [[dying alone|lonely]] basement-dwelling [[otaku]] nerd who can only be bothered to leave the computer to take a shit, one can't help but to imagine the operating system being a hot [[animu]] girl. These fantasizations are called '''OS-Tans''', a concept originating from [[Japan]] — especially considering the whole "combining a computer operating system with anime" — that consists of [[furries|anthropomorphized]] characters based off of [[PC]] operating systems, such as [[Apple]], [[Windows]], and [[Linux]]. It's [[common knowledge]] that most hardcore [[wapanese]] you'd come across may know a thing or two about these OS-tans, and some may even have bizzare fantasies about [[sick fuck|having sex with inanimate objects]] — yes, even with their computer — but nobody really [[nobody cares|gives a shit]]. And [http://www.wired.com/culture/design/multimedia/2007/04/gallery_mascots?slide=10 according to Wired News], [[Fact|the OS-tans are rated the lamest technology mascots ever]].<br/>Most of the OS-tans are made to look like [[16 year old girls]], or probably even [[loli|less than six]]. Regardless of which, that's as far as people would [[batshit insane|go]] with this fandom.

==Variations and Spinoffs==
===[[Wikipedia]]===
[[Image:Neko Wikipe-tan.png|frameless|left|100px]]
Due to the fact that Wikipedia is bursting at the seams with its wapanese population, the wikipedos there have applied this same principle to their wiki by creating a mascot of their own to [[masturbation|jack off]] to. Known as ''Wikipe-tan'', she has many variations of her own; some even have [[furry|cat-ears]].

===[[Firefox]]===
[[Image:Firefoxtan3.jpg|frameless|left|100px]]
It was bad enough being the preferred browser by [[at least 100]] million Internet users. This of course needed to be glorified with a mascot of their own, ''Firefox-ko''.

===[[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]===

Yes, we have our own mascot as well.

===[[4Chan]]===
[[Image:Yotsuba Just as Planned.jpg|frameless|left|100px]]
Unlike the other mascots, 4Chan's "mascot" ''Yotsuba'' wasn't created by 4Chan itself or through their fans. Instead, she [[art theft|originates from a manga series]] known as "Yotsubato!".
