'''The Annoying Orange''' is yet another symbol of the downfall of the internet and the plague of [[Dane Cook|unfunny, low-end consumer humor]] being foisted on its users via its chief conduit, [[YouTube]]. This series of videos were created by a [[douche]] calling himself Daneboe (aka Dane Boedigheimer), a [[faggot]] who [[Computer Science III|learned how to chroma-key]] on Sony Vegas and likes to [[molest]] Zach Gordon three times a week. Presumably, he also plays the eyes and mouth of the main character, proudly displaying his [[magibon|crooked, disturbing dental work]], [[Flea Market Montgomery|bulbous eyes]] and eponymous annoying voice with every new installment. 

Despite the fact that [[shit nobody cares about|nobody really knows what it means]] and that it shows the usual signs of advanced [[pot|marijuana]] usage (shitty puns, repetition, an insufferably jerkass protagonist and the anthropomorphizing of food items [see ''[[Adult Swim|Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''] ) it's presently enjoying an advanced number of views, thanks to sympathetic [[loser|potheads]] and YouTube's largest demographic, [[13-year-old boys]], who ubiquitously describe it as LiEk OmG TeH BeSt ShOw [[evar|EvAr]]!!!!11

'''The Annoying Orange''' is an exercise in metaphorical symbolism, and is thus a transparent depiction of creator Daneboe's own problems with intimacy and social interaction. The orange is a [[emo|lonely, misunderstood]] piece of fruit whose [[faggot|homosexual]] advances are invariably rebuffed by his fellow food items, resulting in only more confusion and existential angst at his miserable, irrelevant condition. Attempts at [[prostitute|paying for gay sex]] not relieving his pathetic existence, he ponders first a [[trap|gender change]], then [[suicide]] after contracting [[AIDS|HIV]].

In addition to this compelling storyline, another secret of the show's success is that it's based on a proven theory that people [[GIF|love repetition]]. Just like [[homosexuals|the Power Rangers]] and [[Pokemon]], the show has a reliable routine of how to create its videos:
