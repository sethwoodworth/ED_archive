[[Work safe]] ('''WS''') or '''Safe for work''' ('''SFW''') are terms to warn that images are not obscene, violent or [[Bukkake|fucking sweet]]!!!!!11[[oneone]]ha1!  Work safe means that it is safe to look at from work, while working, while not working, while thinking about working, or while thinking about quitting work. 

==Stop playing on the internet and get back to work==
One day, a [[me|dude]] posted a witty picture of a woman with sausages in her [[ass]] and something else in her [[cunt]].  Another [[you|dude]] opened it and got totally [[pwned|fired]].  As a result, [[you|the fired faggit]] had to move back in with his [[mom]] and write hilarious [[Uncyclopedia]] articles until three AM while totally BLASTED off of NyQuil.  Anything [[pornography|cool]] such as [[Furry|poorly drawn animals having sex in Nazi uniforms]] or violent material is not work safe.  A synonym for work safe is [[NSFW|'''N'''ow '''S'''how '''F'''riends and '''W'''orkmates]].

{{squote|'''I couldn't care less about SFW or NSFW.  That website [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] looks like every single degenerate that's ever been on the internet ever designed it.'''|some faggot on [[EQ2Flames]]}}

==lol Who the fuck labels Images?==
[[Some argue]] that [[homosexual|morally sensitive]] and responsible [[blog]]gers, [[conservatives]], [[liberals]], [[pedophiles]], [[pedophiles|rednecks]] and [[Jimbo Wales]] label their images.  This is because they are not down with killing the [[White people|white man]].
