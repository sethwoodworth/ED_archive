'''Cassiel''' is a [[Dollfie]] [[BNF|'''B'''ig '''N'''ame '''F'''atty]] which means she spends too much fucking money on pretty resin dildos and is famous on the internets for it.  She also is internets-famous in the [[Crap|J-Rock]] fandom, which means she spends too much fucking money being a [[weeaboo]] for shitty music.  She's since given up trying to collect the sweat from her favorite Japanese rock star's balls however, as her dolls are very demanding of her ample free time.

While a [[BNF]], her position in the [[Dollfie]] fandom is below that of [[Aimee]] because she is much uglier than Aimee and is unable to afford as many dolls due to being [[Australia|Austrailian]].  She maintains her position in the fandom by creating and selling [[furry|fur]] wigs for the dolls.



== MY DOLLS HAVE FEELINGS YOU KNOW ==

Cassiel has long felt that her dolls have [[otherkin|feelings]], much unlike those below her in the [[Dollfie]] [[fandom]].  This is not to say that she isn't a spiteful, ravenous [[fat|eatbeast]], ready to strike when threatened.  She has in her employ an army of sockpuppets and lesser fangirls to do her dirty work, and [[rape|defend]] the fandom when it comes under attack from [[Mundane]]s.  

For instance, in old times, [[at least 100|the long, long ago]], the [[Dollfie]] article first arrived on [[ED]].  Where in which [[gay|intreped]] EDiots posted pictures of her two BJDs in a pre-rape state.  All was good and full of lulz until Cassiel did a [[vanity search]] and found the offending picture.  Naturally, the only way to stop this was to [[vandal|violate]] the article since the ED Mods are sooooo meeeeeeean.  And so, sockpuppets and fangirls, anonymous and with names, swooped in to attack everyone and everything associated with the article, including innocent bystanders.  

In the end, much lulz and penis macros were had, as all the reverts took about 2 seconds to fix.  As always.

== DON'T MOCK ME THAT'S NOT FAIR WAAAAHHHHHH ==

Cassiel is a confirmed [[fat|eatbeast]], like all others before her in the [[Dollfie]] [[fandom]].  She's not even rich and famous like [[Aimee]].  She's only got 8 BJDs. How sad.  She often frets on her Livejournal over how people don't like her or her dolls because frankly, '''IT IS TRUE'''.

If one wishes to [[troll]] Cassiel, they only need to say something mean about her [[dollfie|dollfies]] somewhere on the internet, preferably on Livejournal.  It may take her awhile to find it but she will come running in sooner or later, [[pocky]] a' dangling from her fat mouth.  The day that she finds this article will be sure to bring forth some glorious [[wank]].

== BANHAMM0RZ'D!!!1 ==

On July 10th, 2007, Cassiel was smacked in the [[boob|saggy tits]] by the mother of all [[banhammer|banhammers]] and removed firmly from the exalted position of head [[moderator|ass-reamer]] at her favorite lurking place, Den of Angels, for being an [[attention whore|attention-seeking]] [[emo]] cunt. The ensuing [[Lollercaust|lolocaust]] almost collapsed the [[internets|intarwebs]] and Den of Demons server melted from [[lulz]] overload.  More [[lulz]] were had when Cassiel complained about the  [[lulz]] overload on her LJ. Nobody knows why the [[banhammer]] fell on her enormous, drool-chopped ass, but it's been speculated that she was in fact discovered to be a fat, unwashed 47-year-old [[transsexual]] pedophile when she attempted to push her calloused, nicotine-stained finger up a [[16 year old girl|16 year old fangirl]]'s [[cunt|mimsy]] at the latest [[Dollfie]] [[convention|fag-o-con]].

She now ekes out a living at the sewage farm, sucking up morsel after morsel of [[shit]], [[piss]], piss-soaked shit, used [[condom|condoms]], and tampons in an attempt to save up some [[money|cash]] to move to fucking [[Zimbabwe|Botswana]] or somewhere, [[everyone]] hopes. Sadly, it'll probably be spent on adding more [[dollfie|dildoes]] to her gay harem of doll-u-fag.
