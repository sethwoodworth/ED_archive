E-Tantrum
An '''E-Tantrum''' is a particulary [[lulzy]] result of [[butthurt]] that often occurs when you thoroughly [[pwn]] a [[fanboy]] or [[fangirl|girl's]] obsession, or is the climax of a particularly good [[flamewar]].  E-Tantrums can be identified by posts made in [[ALLCAPS]] with frequent [[JeffK|spelling errors]] that usually do more to make the poster look like an utter [[fucktard]] than inflict any sort of [[troll's remorse|damage]] on the opposing parties.  E-Tantrums are commonly precedent to a [[Final_solution|Final Solution.]]
