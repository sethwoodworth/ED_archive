E-psychiatry

Analysis of the human mind as understood by [[insane]] internet [[geek]]s from their own marathon sessions with state-appointed counselors. Diagnosis usually occurs during a [[flame war]], before discussion of opponents' ancestry but after examination of the most likely form of their [[pervert|sexual deviancy]]. "[[shit nobody cares about|Nature vs Nurture]]" is a popular matter for philosophical [[debate]], as in "Did your mother hold you underwater too long as an infant or were you born with only two brain cells working?"

Note that an [[E-Psychiatrist]] is unlikely to diagnose the patient as having something glamourous like [[Asperger's syndrome]].

**"You have no power, no influence, no family, no character, no [[job]], [[You don't have any friends|no friends]] and [[Poor|no money]]. You just hang out here hoping that someone might be stoopid enough to befriend you. Too late, everyone knows you're a manipulative [[ass]]wipe that just uses people for his own gratification. Even if they were that stoopid, after 15 minutes, they'd have you figured out. You're ancient history, yesterday's bully - today's [[Lol-cow|laughing stock]]. I'd say get a life but you have no hope, no future and we can all be thankful for that. You really are insane. Get help. Or come make good on your threats, you gutless freak."

== Diagnosed?  U may have CYBERCHONDRIA ==
Patients who search for medical advice on the Internet can become afflicted with a condition called "cyberchondria," in which they misdiagnose their symptoms and seek unnecessary treatment, according to a study. Researchers found that "misleading" or "vague" advice online could lead to the problem, AFP/Yahoo News reports.

Researchers from the University of Derby in the United Kingdom for 18 months browsed medical Web sites that provide information on common symptoms and treatments on illnesses ranging from colds to cancer. They found that many sites, including those run by individuals, included inaccurate information that could lead people to incorrectly diagnose themselves. The study also found that Web sites associated with societies, charities and professional bodies provided reliable advice, AFP/Yahoo News reports (AFP/Yahoo News, 10/3).
