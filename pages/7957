T-Mobile

'''T-Mobile USA''' is a [[Txt msg|wireless carrier]], which began service in 1990. They have historically been known as "the wireless carrier for hipsters in the know", and have provided better service from start to finish then any other carrier, [[Original research|fact]].

== A bit of Background ==
[[Image:T-mobile-g1-htc-dream.jpg|thumb|right|The G1, their flagship device. [[God]] saw that it was good, too.]]
T-Mobile is a [[German]] company, and thus is run by [[nazi]]s, not [[jews]]. As history shows, nazis are [[trolls]], and it's only fair to say that there are trolls on the [[internet]]. Their acquisition of [[old|Voicestream]] gave T-Mobile the [[Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Indiana]] markets to dominate, and some areas in [[Georgia]]. While competitors like [[Kike|AT&T]] and [[Idiot|Verizon]] were busy using old technology and running things like [[serious business]] in [[New York]], T-Mobile was free to build a market where people actually give a damn about service.

First thing's first, T-Mobile support [[India|isn't]] [[mexico|outsourced]]. They built a company their customers could benefit from, and in the [[Epic fail|2008-2009 Financial Disaster]] was the only company to not have massive cutbacks or layoffs. In quite [[irony|a twist of fate]], T-Mobile actually '''increased''' their teams and put ''more'' into their infrastructure. As a result, while other companies scramble to stay alive, [[Underdog|T-Mobile]] is on the forefront.

Then again, T-Mobile has always been in the know while making the right moves. The "''[[Sidekick]]''", was used by famous troll [[hepkitten]] in the [[LiveJournal]] hayday. It was T-Mobile's first "Social network-central device", and empowered other networks to look at a phone being more than [[Boring|just a phone]]. In 2006, T-Mobile took a chance with Motorola again and launched the RAZR, a sleek, powerful phone that again changed how we think about phones. Instead of a bulky, brick design, the RAZR was [[emo|razor edge]] thin, had more features than your average phone and was priced so cheap that at it's peak, it was being [[free|given away]].

T-Mobile saw that it was good, and began to listen to customer feedback. They gathered as much as they could, observed hundreds more in their daily life, sat down with [[Google]] and said "build it, and make it godly." Thus, the G1 was born. G1, or [[Android]], is the proper phone for life in a modern internet society. Packed with features you simply can't live without, such as a dedicated [[YouTube]] player, [[Twitter]] application, [[GPS]] and a more streamlined interface than the [[iPhone|iFail]]; the G1 is again revolutionizing the way we think about phones.

== Customer Service ==
T-Mobile is a customer-centric business and listens to customer comments, which has one of the highest regarded service departments in the industry. [[b/tard|/b/tards]] from every walk of life are employed by T-Mobile, from in-store sales to customer service all the way to network support. No matter what department, what your problem, a /b/tard will almost certainly be on the other line, in the store or working diligently to get [[moar]] service to you.


=== T-Mobile Twitter Team ===
Then of course, this holds true to the [[Twitter]] T-Mobile service line. T-Mobile knows that Twitter is a desirable area for consumer questions as their best customers are hipsters, who will almost certainly be down with [[Web 2.0]]. Which of course means, at some point, this is going to happen...

Thus proving the [[Rules 1 and 2|initial point]], which was [[newfags|mitigated by a certain group]] to protect us from this sort [[fail|of thing]].

== Great Moments in T-Mobile History ==

*[[2002]]<sup><small><nowiki>[[</nowiki>''Citation Needed''<nowiki>]]</nowiki></small></sup>: [[Hep]] gets his first Sidekick, allowing him to receive [[drama]] on the go. Sure the screen was small and the battery was worse than an [[iPod]]'s, but it was in the 1.0 peak, just before things got [[awesome]].
*[[2003]]: [[TTT]]<sup><small><nowiki>[[</nowiki>''[[Nobody cares|Who?]]''<nowiki>]]</nowiki></small></sup> starts T-Mobile service after [[old|Voicestream]] is acquired.
*[[2005]]: [[Sidekick]] LX is launched, to the delight of black persons everywhere.
*[[2007]]: T-Mobile launches "Callertunes", a service that for $1.99 a month will gladly replace the ringing noise people hear when they call you with music of your choice. That ringing noise never sounded so good, has it?
*[[2008]]: The G-phone is released as an operating system, on the [[Nobody cares|HTC Dream]]. T-Mobile and Google give AT&T the finger and release it, dubbed the [[God|G1]]. It is widely believed that the phone [[Amazing|sold on actual usability]] which was designed around [[win|user input]]; unlike [[Apple]], which sold it's devices primarily on hype and [[Goatse|good looks]].
*[[2009]]: T-Mobile starts using Twitter as an official line of customer service, thus leading /b/tards to spout memes like [[faggots]] while at [[work]].
