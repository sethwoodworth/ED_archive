Marquee
A '''marquee''' is a useful tool [[troll]]s use to [[flood]] or otherwise annoy other people. Several marquee wars took place between some of the original [[LJDrama]] staff in 2002 and 2003, primarily between [[jameth]], [[quasidan]] and [[mediacrat]] (when he was still [[selfsufficience]]). Others such as [[Jackola]] were also involved.

Marquees became a great source of [[lulz]] in the [[liberal]] [[community]] when people began posting comments and pictures as a marquee scroll.  Albeit an [[old meme]], the marquee is still a great [[lulz]]ortunity whenever [[azad_slide]] posts anything anywhere.

'''Note''': marquees (besides the simple marquee, see below) often do not display properly in [[Failfox]].

== Simple Marquee ==

A simple marquee is charming yet easy to create. <pre><marquee>marquee text</marquee></pre> Due to its simplicity, simple marquees are often looked down upon by experienced trolls.

== Marquee Properties==

Experienced marqueeers (aka mar[[fag]]s) use these to create beautiful marquees.
* width
* height
* direction - RIGHT/LEFT/UP/DOWN
* loop
* bgcolor
* behavior - SCROLL/SLIDE/ALTERNATE.
* scrollamount
* scrolldelay 

Advanced example:
 <marquee height=100 direction=down bgcolor=red behavior=alternate scrolldelay=10>
  FAG
 </marquee>

<marquee height=100 direction=down bgcolor=red behavior=alternate scrolldelay=10>
 FAG
</marquee>

== Nested Marquee ==

You can have a [[Pimp My Ride|marquee within a marquee]] to make it go diagonal.

Super advanced example: <pre><marquee direction=left behavior=scroll scrollamount=50 scrolldelay=250>
  <marquee direction=up behavior=alternate scrollamount=5 scrolldelay=100>
      <img src="homo.png" />
  </marquee>
</marquee></pre>

<marquee direction=left behavior=scroll scrollamount=50 scrolldelay=250>
  <marquee direction=up behavior=alternate scrollamount=5 scrolldelay=100>
      <img src="homo.png" />
  </marquee>
</marquee>
