[[Image: Sitting_Jassy_ID_by_NumberoftheBeatz.jpg|thumb|180px|A commonly known [[Self-insert|virus]] from the ''Maria suzae'' species.]]

As a follower of [[Branca]], some can say that sheâ€™s not a very dominant icon in the [[Mary Sue]] fan [[faggotry]]. However, this particular [[suethor]] known as "Draw Girl Jassy" or "DGJassy" (don't ask) is one of the many viral species in DeviantART (Link to gallery: [http://numberofthebeatz.deviantart.com/gallery/#One-Piece NumberoftheBeatz]), and she will pair her very same [[retard]]ed character with any (and every) lead [[fandom]] [[male]] she may possibly come up with, as well as draw all of them sickeningly [[kawaii]]. Of course, upon drawing these unproperly cute and soulless versions of male characters from various [[fandom]]s, she infects them with remarkable [[fail]], rendering them limp-wristed, weak and [[fag]]tacular. Although she is lightyears behind [[Mary Sue|Branca]] in popularity, she still has a rather solid circle of [[friends]] and watchers, particularly because she draws [[fanart]] of [[Internet celebrity|popular artists]] along with [[Mary Sue|her own fancharacters]] she insists on inserting in online [[RPG|roleplaying games]].

== A Professional Suethor ==
Located in [[Germany]], DGJassy is known for having done several collaborations with [[Branca]] featuring Steel Pot, a shitty "[[Gorillaz]] [[WTF|alterego]]" which gave enormous [[Internet celebrity|popularity]] to [[Branca|her idol]], and [[Mary Sue|Jassy]], a cartoonified version of herself that seems to be [[Asking for it|begging to be shagged]] by whoever she's paired with. But she claims it's not lust for a fictional character: it's [[Secks|LOVE]]. As a fine example of a fucked-up [[weeaboo]], she's always referring [[Branca]] as her ''sensei'', and drawing lots of pictures based on [[Serious business|their roleplay adventures]], which make the worst [[soap opera]] ever after [[Nobody cares|Branca's marriage]].

== The Recipe for a Mary Sue ==
DGJassy uses her character Jassy ([[Nice try|in many variations]]) to explore new levels of [[failure]] by putting her through different scenarios and plotlines and [[fandom]]s, just to end up falling in love with the main male character. That means, if [[Saturday Night Live]] was a trend, she would draw herself probably as a pair for Will Ferrell. Let's face the [[fact]]s: she would end up [[Totalulz|funnier]] than him.

==== The Plot ====
# Jassy, who's the little [[Shit|sister]] of Murdoc from [[Gorillaz]], sees [[Original character|Steel Pot]] and [[LOL|falls in love with him]]. 
# Steel [[Love|treats her bad]].
# [[Batshit insane|Jassy loves Steel Pot]].
# Steel doesn't treat [[Branca]] bad, maybe because she's his [[Whore|creator]].
# [[O RLY|Jassy loves Steel Pot]].
# Jassy gets [[pregnant]] of [[Nazi|Steel Pot]].
# [[Branca|Sensei]] doesn't let Jassy get pregnant of Steel Pot, because [[LOL WUT|"alteregos can't breed"]].
# [[Coward|Jassy changes the story]], turning the offspring into an adopted [[baby]].
# [[Fucktard|Jassy loves Steel Pot]]. 
# [[Fangirl|Jassy has a crush]] on Samuel, another [[Nobody cares|irrelevant character]] by [[Branca]].
# Steel [[Lulz|gets jealous]].
# [[Bitch|Jassy loves Steel Pot and Samuel]].
# Steel Pot [[Fail|fights for Jassy]].
# [[Nice try|Samuel leaves]] (he was irrelevant anyway).
# [[Stupid|Jassy loves Steel Pot]]. 
# [[Oh noes|Jassy and Steel Pot are back again]].
# [[????]]
# [[PROFIT]]!

== Draw my Character! ==
Like any other [[crazy]] [[fangirl]], DGJassy puts up many contests in which the participants must draw her with any of her [[internet crush]]es. In other words, she's asking you to draw [[fanart]]. The prizes are just [[crap|wonderful]]. She lacks inspirations, so she's just redrawing the entry of someone else and pretending this to be a well-paid honour for the [[poor|winners]]. [[fail|FAIL]].

== DGJassy, the Bitch ==
Nowadays, DGJassy seems to be tired of sticking to [[Branca|''sensei's'']] arse and manages to find a good and patient artist so she can [[Theft|have some inspiration]] to draw. 
If the poor victim happens to be a [[male]], DGJassy will use all her [[Whore|cute]] powers to convince him to draw [[fanart]] for her. [[Branca|Seems familiar]]. She's got a [[boyfriend]], but [[Cheating|she doesn't seem to care about him]], she's too busy being an [[attention whore]]. It looks like she's been learning a lot from [[Branca|''sensei'']], isn't it?
You can see her harrassing moves [http://boredman.deviantart.com here.]

== DGJassy is crawling in her skin ==
Although DGJassy always denies she's an [[Drama|emo faggot]], she never passes out an opportunity for some attention-whoring. That's so lame and full of idiocy, her friends finally understood that she's a sad case of Aspergers, ADD and PMS, and started ignoring her dirty moves.
Take a look at the [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/2427318/1012194796 last move] she made on a deviant, just before writing her emo journal.
