Alra Galathor the human translation of Algar Gelethorn the reincarnation of the ancient warlord plays [[crap|epic]] [[gay|power metal]] with his band of the same name. Alra Galathor also has two side projects shiriashi a dark approach to power metal, and  Rays of Sunshine a collaboration of folk music from around the world.

== The History of the Warlord ==
'''WARNING: DRAGON RIDING POWER METAL FAG AHEAD!'''

Alra Galathor known as Kasey to common folk is a metalhead and a [[fag|hippie]] (yes it is possible). He is a mighty warlord yet unable to feel hate as revealed in conversations, and also a strong believer in [[pagan|faganism]]. The abomination was conceived [[at least 100 years ago]] to a family of [[jenkem]] huffing illegal immigrants. He resides in the mountains of [[Canadia]]. Kasey is a timid human scared of others and likes to hide his disfiguring cleft lip (especially in photos). When he is not fapping furiously to/or drawing his own [[hentai]]. He enjoys playing [[world of warcraft]] and writing songs for his non existant band.

== Trolling Alra Galathor ==
During October of 2007 an angel was sent to relieve Kasey of his [[virgin|virginity]]. Her name was Alice. She was an attractive young woman 17 years of age. Chronically depressed and looking for someone to love, she met Kasey on [[nexopia]].com and began to hit it off. Little did Alra know, there are [[no girls on the internet]] and fell right into this [[trap]]. Much lulz ensued as Kasey began telling her his fantasies and attempting cyber with her. Being the oblivious idiot he is, he never caught on despite several warning signs. In November, Alice's grandfather died which caused her depression to kick in and made her very [[insane|unhappy]]. Despite this being clearly evident to him, Alra Galathor attempted to [[cybersex|electronically "open her gates"]] anyway. In December, Alice became [[an hero]] by trying to cut her throat, then going into the garage to turn on the car and poison herself with carbon monoxide. Galathor was informed of her death IRL by anon, it was reported that he then [[cry|cried]] [[over 9000]] times. Alra Galathor is just as easy to troll IRL as he is on the internets and should be trolled for great justice.
