The Great Thread Scare of Friday 13th
On Friday June 13th 2008 a very epic thread was formed on [[Paheal]]. It all started with people abusing the hell out of the newly spawned Paheal [[mini meme|spin-off meme]] "In b4 DesuMilk". Desumilk had gotten fed up of people making fun of her and had posted "In b4 people say in b4 desumilk" only to be thoroughly [[pwnt]] and proved to be a [[trap]]. The lulz went on as [[internet tough guys]] started degrading [[woman|womenz]] for the lulz. Eventually an under aged b& member of Paheal started asking people if they could kill his step mom for him, an offer which was joyously taken up by many an anon. An [[Anonymous]] member quickly turned the thread into a race to get to the 100th Anonymous poster, this is when the [[Mindfuck|mindfuckery]] began. Posters started going from Anonymous99 to Anonymous89, eventually [[messiah|Anonymous100]] [[I came|came]], but it used [[Abra|teleport]] before anyone could [[Man the harpoons|capture it]]. Anonymous members soon started to cry and flee the scene in fear of mental retardation, but one retarded anon stayed behind claiming that he was the son of [[Sparta|King Leonidas]]. This Anonymous could well have been his son as he failed just like his alleged father. The thread got to it's 94th Anonymous and then disappeared off of the face of the [[internets]]. This thread was deemed "The Missingno Thread" and the picture that hosted it has yet to be re-uploaded. Some claim this was a conspiracy against America done by the Jews themselves other say that it was done by Captain Planet, but one thing is certain, there were doves everywhere and they were crying their asses off.

:[[Dickhead|Nietzche]]: [[Badass|You know what? I'm actually gonna be the bigger man here, and just step out. call me if you wanna hook up Desu, otherwise fuck off.]]
:MR Furry: the more anons the better if you mean that
:wutmaster: I meant they shouldn't be [[banned]] if they produce [[lulz]]
:MR Furry: oh yes
:Anonymous10: [[A challenger appears|DON'T WORRY I'LL START A KNEW ONE HEY EVERYONE I'VE GOT A VAGINA TOO]]
:Nietzche: BITCH, IT'S ON!
:[[User:Rule34d|Rule34d]]: Go for it.

:Nietzche: I just found it funny to [[Troll|fuck around w/]] desumilk randomly for an afternoon.
:Nietzche: But we must move on to bigger and better things. In other news, [[God]] is [[dead]].
:Anonymous13: [[Attention Whore|PLEASE FUCK ME I'M LONELY AND NEED ATTENTION]]
:Anonymous14: This is such [[bullshit]].
:Rule34d: Go fuck yourself
:Anonymous15: im game...where u live
:Anonymous16: Ow, that cut deep 34d.
:Rule34d: @anon 16: it was directed at anon 13
:Anonymous17: OMG THE [[Pokemon|POKEMANS]] R HAVIN BUTTSECKS
:Incognitymous: I thought I would mention that I own a vagina as well. It's not on me personally, rather it is on the object I have shackled to my oven to prepare my meals.
:Anonymous18: @34d: Oh, well then nevermind.
:MetroidAddict: this isnt bullshit
:THIS

:[[Sparta|DESUMILK!!!!!!]]
:Anonymous19: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
:Anonymous20: Incognitymous has just won the prize, you've discovered the ANSWER.
:Nietzche: What the fuck was the question?
:Anonymous21: What is the question all men ask?
:Incognitymous: @Nietzche: If you have to ask then you already know.
:Anonymous22: hey Incognitymous, does your vagina prepare the meals or the men you control with it
:Nietzche: Why am I on a site dedicated to raping childhood memories at 1 o clock at night?
:Anonymous23: @Incognitymous: Then what would motivate him to ask?
:wutmaster: It's not 1 o'clock everwhere.
:Incognitymous: Well the vagina doesn't prepare any meals, it's the thing it's attached to that does all the cooking. The vagina starts working when dinner is finished.
:Nietzche: It's always one o' clock somewhere, though.
:Anonymous24: It's 5 o'clock somewhere.
:Anonymous25: ITS FRIDAY THE 13TH WHERE IM AT
:Anonymous26: OMG ME TOO
:Incognitymous: @Anon23: The question.
:evilpika: But it's 5 o'clock somewhere.
:Anonymous27: do we all die or just me and anon 26
:Anonymous28: @Incognitymous: Then there is the answer to my question.
:[[Slowpoke|evilpika]]: O_O [[Ninja|Ninja'd]]... A LOT.
:Anonymous29: NO WAIT NOT ME TOO ITS THE 14TH NOW

:Anonymous36: also my [[mom]] is [[dead]], asshole
:Anonymous37: Who cares? Long as theres cum i'm game *fapfapfap*
:MetroidAddict: cough[[Necrophilia|necrophilla]] cough
:Anonymous38: YES I WISH I HAD ONE
:Incognitymous: To finish my statement, it's especially a problem if you're a [[woman]] as you [[lose]] about a quarter of your usefulness.
:Anonymous39: [[NO U]]
:Incognitymous: Well your mom would be fine if she had just [[In the kitchen|cooked my dinner]] like I asked.
:Anonymous40: OH SHIT GUYS I NEED SOMEONE TO DONATE AN ASSHOLE I'LL ASK MY PIMP FOR MONEY
:Anonymous41: Anon39's statement is not true.
:Anonymous42: my dead mom?....oh your horrible
:Anonymous43: Anon43's statement is not true, either.
:Anonymous44: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh joo gaht told
:Anonymous45: the comments far surpass the quality of the picture
:MetroidAddict: im saving this and the old Darkrai convo for the lulz
:Anonymous46: If anon 43's statement isn't true: wouldn't that make it a lie?
:Anonymous47: [[Time Paradox|pime taradox!]]
:[[Wigger|Nietzche]]: black person post [[link]] to old [[Pokemon|darkrai]], forgot to save it.
:Incognitymous: Anon43's statement is true in the sense that it is not true.
:Anonymous48: @anon45: Oh hell yea man, fuck the picture this is goin' in my special files.
:Anonymous49: Incognitymous, you can kill my step mom she is horrible
:Anonymous50: @Incognitymous: Then it is lie that makes truth into lie that makes lies into thruths et cetera?
:MetroidAddict: [http://rule34.paheal.net/post/view/168885 >>168885]
:Anonymous51: YES A [[Time Paradox|PIME PARADOX]]
:Nietzche: [[Nazi|Grazi]]. You [[win]] some internetz. Let's make it six.
:Incognitymous: Well I don't [[kill]] [[women]] for no reason. For every women I kill that is potentially one more Man who will have to cook or go hungry
:Anonymous52: LOL "go hungry", I love you man, you're the highlight of this comment page.
:MetroidAddict: [[Fail|in b4 pime paradox]]

:Anonymous56: well if i kill her id prbably get grounded or sent to [[jail]]...[[no|murder is bad right]]?
:wutmaster: lulz
:Anonymous57: @Incognitymous: Then all things are true if a sufficient repetition of lies being claimed lies is placed before! My friend you are a GENIUS.
:wutmaster: [[FAIL]]
:Incognitymous: It's not a crime to kill a woman. In fact, objects can't technically be killed so there is no crime unless it doesn't belong to you.
:[[Mafia|Anonymous58]]: I'll kill her, 50 Grand, accident or not?
:Anonymous59: Seems like this thread is [[old|past its prime]].
:MR Furry: @56 my boss will be happy to see you here
:Anonymous60: make her know its happening...[[pain series|slowly]]
:MetroidAddict: [[your mom]] is [[old|past her prime anon59]]
:Nietzche: [[Past]] it's [[Metroid|METROID PRIME]], [[Bitch|BITCH]]!
:Anonymous61: Is he real old by the way? Because you can save around... 3,000 if so.
:Nietzche: I apologize. In a perfect world, my statement would have been at least remotely funny.
:Anonymous62: MetroidAddict is [[Obvious|Captain Obvious]].
