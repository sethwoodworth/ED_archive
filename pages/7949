'''sxephil''' ([[porn|pron]]. "sexy fail") is a wannabe Dane Cook and hyper[[homosexual]] asshole who posts awful videos to [[YouTube]]. He is also a cock-sucking pig famous for his overly plucked eyebrows and powdery make-up. To date, he is the only person to have signed up for every single video website ever created. Sxephil is also known for redefining the term [[attention whore]]. Before he had many subscribers, he learned the art of [[YouTube View Fraud]], so that all of his videos were soon included on the most viewed list. He is currently riding the popularity wave of his cockblock "Big Boobs and You" video, in which an icon of a big titted woman is utilized to obtain more views.  He was recently featured on the YouTube main page due to his [[faggotry]] with MGM. It's a known fact that YouTube features anything [[Williamsledd|even remotely gay]].

Sxephil is also a member of the Gay Pride Wing of the YouTube [[The_Kewl_Kids|Kewl Kids Association]]. He charges five hundred dollars for collaboration videos, and his boyfriend is [[bravesgirl5]] ([[trap|prove it's a chick]]). 

'''Sxephil is now an [[internet panhandling|internet panhandler]]. Please give him all your money now! No donations under $5 accepted. Thank you.

[[PROTIP]]: Real name, Philip Franchina; fake name, Philip Defranco

Essentially, Philip is a 23-year-old unemployed loser who uses the term "new media entertainment" to describe his job: he records himself being a spastic jackass and uploads the videos to YouTube, as any [[asspie]] child can do. The real motive behind his "job choice" is his complete inability to do anything that contributes positively to society even in the slightest. His father suffers from [[AIDS]] and his kidneys are about to fail because Philip isn't there to actually do a damn thing about it. Since he is a useless retard, he plans to cure his father's AIDS the only way he can: being a complete faggot on [[over 9000]] video sharing sites and becoming wealthy enough to either get a haircut or have his father [[Church_of_Euthanasia|put to sleep]]. He loves to laugh at his own jokes, [[Fellatio|take car rides with boys]], and consistently align his opinions with the majority of [[Liberalism|JewTubers]] so that nobody will ever, ever dislike him. He claimed that he'd stop uploading videos sometime during November 2009, but as of January 2010, that promise is as broken as his anal hymen. Phil also can talk like he is on XTC. But he can't afford it. Poor guy.. Here is an example:

==The DeFranco Nation==
[[Image:Phil1.jpg|thumb|right|"Can I [[buttsecks]] you?"]]
The DeFranco Nation was established to give its members a place to roam free, have fun, and inflict harm unto one another with words and/or sexy massage according to their leader, Phil. Essentially, it's a group of mindless drones who don't understand [[humor]]. They blindly follow him into the elite realm of [[shit no one cares about|YouTube celebrity]], with the hope that they will profit from the venture.

==Phil's Oath to the Internet ([[TL;DW]])==

{{quote|[[shit no one cares about|This post was inspired from the constant question of, “What is Your Real Day Job?”. This is my “job title”, according to most advertisers that contact me, so I will continue to use it in this post. New Media Entertainment isn’t as new as many people believe. It has been around for some time, and was popularized by ZeFrank who gave many video makers inspiration to pick up a camcorder. I learned about the online video scene when I first found the lonelygirl15 series and vlogger Renetto, but didn’t decide to join until I watched ZeFrank’s video on how to vlog. The fact is, New Media Entertainment is a very hot field right now. Advertisers have been throwing more money into the online video realm as of late, because statistically users are more likely to act on an ad online, because computer users are more involved in what they watch online, than something they watch on their living room tv’s. Now, I’m not saying all video advertisements will be successful, because “general” advertising has the potential to fail. When I say “general advertising”, I’m talking about programs like Revver/MetaCafe, and also the YouTube Partner Program, if it becomes much easier to become a partner. The reason being, advertisers may not want their product advertised on a specific show that is offensive, or geared to the completely wrong audience. The strength of advertisement in videos are product placements/mentions and sponsorship. For example, RocketBoom.com has sold 2 weeks of video advertisements for $80,000 in the past. Rocketboom.com at that time received 200,000 user views a day/video (5 videos a week), so the advertiser, was paying Rocketboom.com $0.04 per person. THATS $40/CPM! ($40 per 1,000 people). Now whenever I have advertised a product/site (except in the beginning when I was really in need of cash), I have charged around $2,000 per video, which is less than $20CPM considering the show gets over 130,000 views on average. So, I’m not saying everyone can hit that $40/CPM number, but the potential for cash is definitely there. I believe that smart vloggers/video makers, with a large audience, should not and will not receive less than 6 figures incomes for the 2008 year. But, please don’t join to become famous or rich, because the odds are against you.]]|Phil, pretending that he knows anything about marketing}}

==His videos==
All of this videos consist of [[shit nobody cares about]], using recent news stories and [[hawt]] thumbnails of women to bring in the views.
===How to make a sxephil video:===
# Find most "hot" and controversial news using websites like Google Trends, CNN, [[Digg]], etc.
# Steal hot [[pix]] to use as the thumbnail on video
# Try to steal the old Ze Frank style but end up just looking like a douche
# Make title of video "F*CK <insert news story here>' or '<insert name> IS A B!TCH" to make people click on it
# ?????
# [[PROFIT]]!!!

Example titles to bring in views:
*[[Michael Phelps]] Is a DOUCHEBAG!
*[[Sarah Palin]] is a VPILF!!!!
*[[Obama]] is BETTER THAN YOU 
*[[Soulja Boy]] is a B!TCH!

===How he makes a living===
[[Image:promophil.png|thumb|right|[http://forums.teneric.co.uk/buy-sell-trade/looking-sponsor-6320.html Evidence that he forgot to remove. Post date: 2006.] This picture pretty much sums up the entire purpose of his existence on YouTube.]]
[[Image:Philmillion.jpg|thumb|right|Further proof. Pic is from a video from 2007 which he uploaded for [http://www.nextinternetmillionaire.com/ nextinternetmillionaire.com] Most of his oldest videos are deleted or private in order to hide his view spamming.]]
After spending his life savings buying [[YouTube View Fraud]] [[warez]] and hiring [[nerds]] to establish a YouTube view spamming team, Phil contacted numerous large companies and offered to advertise products for them whilst boasting about how many "[[bullshit|views]]" he was getting. He then advertised stuff in nearly every one of his videos, even though this was in violation of YouTube's [[Rules|Terms of Use]] and continued to do so until the partner program became available. Although they're all now private or deleted, the titles of all of his old videos can be seen [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.youtube.com/sxephil here]. 

As soon as the YouTube partner program became available, he signed up for it and has since been making videos nearly every day to make sure that he's on the most viewed list 24/7 and getting as much money as possible. Who cares if his videos are [[shit]] and use stupid tactics just to boost views? More videos = more [[money]]. Quality and truth don't matter.

Phil is currently creating more and more YouTube channels to which he uploads the same kind of [[unfunny]] [[bullshit]] in his other channels, so that he can continue raking in more cash.

Phil ''says'' he's leaving because YouTube won't pay him enough? WAT!?  
</center>

==Paul Fetch drops dox on Phil==
Unfortunately, Phil never left and is still fagging up the tubes on a daily basis, but recently, Supreme Epic Failure [[Paul Fetch]] turned his attention to Phil and their similar inclination to chow down on manpole (he removed the video shortly thereafter).

==Sxephil's Forums==
Phil's forums were established [[Last Thursday|in December of 2008]]. They have been [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|deleted]] three times since then. These forums are notorious for being breeding grounds of [[16 year old girl]]s and complete and utter [[faggotry]]. After the first shut down, a group of former Phil fans created their own forum. It is unknown how many of these members, if any, still troll Phil's current [[Fail|cesspool of fail]].

==Trolling Phil's forums==
# Post a thread titled something along the lines of [[ALL CAPS|OMG PHIL IS TEH BEST GUY EVAR]]
# Fill said thread with pictures of [[Tubgirl]] or [[Goatse]]. Bonus points if you use [[Pain Series]].
# ????
# [[PROFIT]]!
