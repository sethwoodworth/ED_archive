Internet stalking
{{elaw}} 
[[At least 100 years ago|At least a hundred years ago]], the term "stalker" actually meant someone hiding in your bushes and following you to the grocery store; now it's simply a misnomer referring to those who know how to effectively use the [[Google]] search engine. [[16 year old girls]] like to say they have "Internet stalkers" when really it's just someone Googling their name, trying to find n00ds. Then in a later lawsuit with the Americunt justice system proclaim I googled her and found teh nudez... for tha lawlz.

It is never a legitimate concern.

Stalking is also the act of posting non-private, publicly available information, usually easily discernible from an LJ page. Such an act usually warrants the leveling of a stalking [[Internet Law|charge]]. There is a [[statistics|statistically]]-[[proof|proven]] 99.9% chance that a person talking about stalking or being stalked is simply an [[Attention Whore|attention whore]].  

==Who is a Stalker?==
[[Image:StalkerIRL.png|thumb|left|[[Pedo Scarface|Your typical Stalker.]]]]Stalkers are people who have basic [[Google]] skills and show them by pasting juicy links and funny web-fodder about people. Information used by stalkers is invariably information easily found on the [[Internets]], often posted by the stalkee himself. For example, [http://www.wonderfuldreams.me.uk/advicefrienditto this is an example] of someone stalking [[Girlvinyl]]/[[Frienditto]].

Here is an example of internet stalking in action:<br>
<youtube>nWq7SXaXj8g</youtube>

Kinda cool, by why doesn't it show him [[fap|fapping]] over her picture after he takes it with his phone?

==Who is a Target?==
This question has been analyzed by [[e-Psychiatrist]]s for generations. Stalkees are usually [[women|female]] attention whores filled with [[unwarranted self-importance]]. They usually exhibit characteristics of a [[drama queen]]. Targets also post ridiculous amounts of [[porn|private information]] in public forums, such as on [[LiveJournal]] or [[gurl]] sites. They don't even realize that they are showing way too much of themselves. Almost always, they ask for it.

In the video above, Sarah Evans ("Soccer Girl" or soccergirl8888) of Phoenix, Arizona thought she could be safe after she refused to tell "Alex Gomez" what school she attended. "Alex Gomez" then used her instant messenger nickname to look up her "[[MySpace|MyFreeSpace]]." That listed her e-mail address and real first name. "Alex" then [[Google]]d "Soccergirl@forest.com" to find her real name and home phone number. Then he googled her phone number to find her address. The man then proceeded to deceive and stalk Sarah Evans before having his way with her ([[surprise sex]]), and then finding himself [[Party Van|partyvanned]]. If Sarah Evans had not posted all of that info about herself, then "Alex Gomez" would have never targeted her.

It is also probably notable to mention that many delusional [[fat]] and/or [[ugly]] girls who never get any male attention(and rightly so) will often accuse guys of being a "stalker" or more commonly they will complain about "creepers" who keep [[Lie|"checking them out."]] Sadly, thanks to the fact that no matter how fat and ugly a girl is there is always ''somebody'' who would hit it, the most [[desperate]] of [[white knights]] will probably even join in and defend her and her ridiculous assertions in desperate hopes of getting some [[poontang]], no matter how hideous or morbidly obese. Do you go to the same school as her? Shame on you. Do you live in the same town? You swine. Did you so much as even look in the same direction as that [[man the harpoons|whale?]] If so, you're a [[creepy]] stalker who should be locked up in [[prison]] or [[get a life]] and stop preying on poor, defenseless women.

==Do I have to worry about being stalked?==
No, and [[you]] can thank these facts:
<br>1. [[Noone]] likes you.
<br>2. No one cares about your existence.
<br>4. You are [[Jewish]].
<br>6. You fail at life.

==What to do if Someone is Internet Stalking You==
If someone is stalking you on the internets and you want them to stop, you have several options:
#Acknowledge you have a [[victim mentality]].
#If you're on LiveJournal, complain to [[LJ Abuse]].
#Take the stalker to [[Internet court]].
##Hire [[Internet lawyer]]s.
##Send stalker to [[Internet jail]].
#Get an [[Internet tough guy]] to e-beat the stalker up.
#[[wiki stalking|Make fun of them like this.]]
#Tell them to [[Lie|leave you alone because you know a cop!]]
#[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x7F_t2jReg| Cry about it on youtube like a whiny bitch.]
#Reverse stalk them

==What to do if You are Stalking Someone==
If you are, or about, to start stalking someone, please consider the following:
#Utilize various techniques, don't just google them.
#Their [[BFF]]'s MySpace page is not blocked to you.
#Consider using traditional (get up off your ass) methods of stalking.
#Create alternate accounts each with different persona.
#????.
#PROFIT

Or better still, just become [[an hero]].

==Internet Stalking versus Traditional Stalking==
[[Image:Stalkerpokeymanz.png|thumb|right|Stalkers: There's one behind every cute girl]]
Internet stalking is often belittled by stalking traditionalists since it lacks a personal touch one can only achieve with [[IRL]] stalking (like [[cum|ejaculating]] onto someone's window while you watch them undress, making shrines out of everyday items they throw away, and, finally, [[rape|raping]] and [[murder|murdering]] them).  In many states, Internet stalking is not a recognized event in their annual stalking championships, despite continued lobbying by the federal stalking taskforce.  [[Wiki stalking]] is a recognized sport on [[Wikipedia]] where the top stalkers gain cash prizes or adminship.
