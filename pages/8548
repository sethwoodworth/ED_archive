Troll Kingdom
[[Image:tkl.JPG|thumb| The Troll Kingdom logo.]]

Troll Kingdom was created by a group of [http://www.trekbbs.com TrekBBS] rejects under the premise of complete free speech on the [[Internets]].

Currently it is nothing more than a hive of crapflooding, attention whoring, and general admin circle-jerking, with its only redemptive feature being its uncanny ability to completely and utterly [[pwn]] would-be invaders, thanks to their [[Lol-cow|assailant's]] desperate need for validation from the Troll Kingdom community they claim sucks at trolling (despite foaming at the mouth while posting there.)

Although a complete shithole due to the aforementioned reasons, Troll Kingdom retains a glorious past of wiping many now-defunct [[science Fiction|science]] and [[fanfiction]] boards off the face of the Internet, using nothing more than the [[Troll|written word]], and the occasional mod account hacking.

== [[No_girls_on_the_internet|missmanners]] ==

Originaly from [[Mugen|Mugen Infantry]] under the username MissBHaven, [[woman|she]] was the owner of Trollkingdom until she recently sold it to posters Coyote Ugly and Grandtheftcow for the money she needed to support her crack habit.

Current admins include Mentalist (a 90lb weakling Brit expatriated to the Greek Isles who claims to have once been a mob enforcer but is, in reality, lactose-intolerant) and Sarek (ex-Air Force washout who lurks in his basement debating the finer points of tranny sex with other members of TK).

(Moar information needed)

== SkinOfEvil ==

Although Troll Kingdom has had quite a few noteworthy trolls nest within its vile womb, none managed to capture and exploit the arcane sorcery of trolling to the extent which SkinOfEvil did.

After being scorned by a ''[[Star Trek]]'' actress [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|no one gives a shit about]] by not signing her autograph for him, Skin proceeded to troll a messageboard of thousands by creating his "Who Raped Yeoman Rand?" thread (Explained [http://www.trollkingdom.net/forum/showthread.php?t=883 here]), in which he fingered Scotty as the rapist, much to the shock and anger of sobbing ''Trek'' nerds.

The ensuing [[lulz|lollergasm]] set in motion a complete lockdown of the largest ''Trek'' board on the Internet, which included a permaban troll massacre and set the foundation for the creation of Troll Kingdom.

A notable Skin dual was the demented MajorBarcalow, whose signature phrase "It makes me angery and magnesium," can be found archived [http://us.geocities.com/glenniebun/Barky/deleny.html here], in a comedy-trolling thread.

Whether or not his trolls were the end-all is certainly debatable. It was, in his words, the 'frontier days' of trolling. However, 5 years after his exploits, his name is still invoked by trolls who lack the vision to surpass him and other noteworthy trolls.

== The board ==

The admins are notorious for using the 'This is TK' defense, which works well in justifying their wildly inconsistent practices. In order to become an admin at TK, you must be an over-the-hill twit who can win at the least the bronze at the circle-jerk Olympics, or send naughty PMs to the owner missmanners. 

The only invading group which has managed to make the admins look like the washed-up, has-been numpties they are were the Ranters, a group of trolls who delivered a total smackdown IRL on a Nigerian scam artist while working with law enforcement, by completely overwhelming the board with sheer numbers and off-topic tangent spamming (Conforming to the Prime Directive of Free Speech) in a blitzkrieg which would make [[Hitler]] blush, forcing the admins to yet again change policy in order to save face.

The Ranters also gave out the home phone number of a particularly abrasive TK member to several Nigerian scamers, who could do nothing more than request it to be changed by his phone company.


===HOW TO TROLL TROLL KINGDOM===

<strike>All you have to do is call the members random insults that don't make sense, they will make countless threads calling you a loser and telling you to shut up.</strike>  That won't work.  You'll get laughed off the board.  If you're lucky, TKers will just ignore you.

== JillianBacardi ==

'''''NOTE: all of the following information has been proven false and included for historical reasons only.  It was later discovered that JillianBacardi was, in fact, the TK board owner MissManners herself trolling the board in one of her usual attempts to bolster membership.'''''

Regarded as by some to be at least a SOE-level troll, a [[Insane|batshit-insane]] woman picked up on an expedition to a mental health board.

After being trolled to the point were she took it upon herself to find the RL home phone number of a person who pwned her ass, called his wife and asked if he posted on the Internets, and was summarily subjected to a law suit by him, which smothered the last ember of her sanity. Regardless of the fact he and another troll no longer posted at TK, she was convinced that almost every account there is a sock-puppet under their control.

She has consistently raved for 2 years about TK being a front for a multi-national weapons, counterfeiting, and drug smuggling operation, and is also run by corrupt government officials who published her tax returns [[OTI]] and "ruined her life" ([http://www.trollkingdom.net/forum/showthread.php?t=29313 We shit you not].) Claims to have 'trolled' the [[FBI]], and is responsible for there existing a folder at FBI HQ regarding TK, the owner, and herself, albeit an insignificant one.

Rumor has that JillianBacardi was a CIA experiment in social engineering and cult manipulation similar to Project Sidelight.  TK member "Darth Sikle" claimed to have been in contact with her on several occasions.  Board administrator "MissManners" ultimately IP banned JillianBacardi after legal threats were made.

== The DLA ==
In late 2005, an insignificant band of wittering simpletons known only as the "Dual Liberation Army" appeared and in a shitzkrieg believed they seized control of the board's karma. This event was known as either the Karmpocalypse or the Karmageddon. Under the leadership of Val Kilmer's Dick, or VKD as he is now known (a known lifeless limpdick, who hides under numerous guises such as McSlothy, [[Panda]], Mongo, Mr. Toad & pixiefroufrou), dual forces including the great Messenger, Dual, Toad (also VKD), and many others held the board in a grip of karma. Eventually (about 2 days later) the admins intervened and the DLA was struck down, although it exists to this day as a figment of VKD's imagination, whilst he registers more accounts to handjob himself with.

The DLA were a bunch of Fucktards.  Karma doesn't matter which makes it clear that no forum can be brought to it's knees because of it.  The only thing the DLA has managed to do is remember the past more fondly than what it really was, a nothing event that nobody cared about.
