Kaye Lazar
'''Kaye Lazar''' (real name '''Kevin Kravitz''', aka '''Dogfucker Jones''') is the sad little man who accompanies [[Gorgeous George]] on every episode of this show. He has [http://www.myspace.com/kevinkravitzfanpageoffun MySpace account] showing off photos he has taken posing with D-list celebrities like Gallagher.
      I got into this avocation years ago, when my meetings with remarkable 
      people drew blank expressions of cynicism and surprise from my friends.
      These people considered me an accomplished liar but a liar nevertheless.
It's not that noone believes you, it's that ''noone gives a shit that you posed for a photo with Gallagher''. Given that posing with these washed-up morons is the highlight of this guy's life and that all his friends consider him a liar, Kevin's life must be pretty fucking sad.

==Response to Bantown BBQ and this article==
Kaye Lazar (who unlike GG can form somewhat of a coherent thought) sent the first email in response to the [[Bantown]] BBQ:
      Thanks for the disturbing picture. Just your computer [[IP]] number was reported to the
      authorites, so I hope you can do a lot of explaining to the [[police]]. If you  care to make
      anymore e-mails to me go ahead, just know other people other than myself are
      viewing this and would be very interested in what other lovely things you have to say.
After further emails with the obligatory "OH NOEZ NOT THE POPO!!!![[42]]!!!" responses and linking him to this article, Gorgeous George gave his take on the situation:
      Subject: '''Eyes   of  the   law   our   WATCHING.'''
      So  your  grabbing  the  torch  from  zipshit   raferty.  A   bunch  of  you  vcu  compulsive
      masterbators ,  obiviously   do  not  have  a  fucking  life.   Keep  wacking  off  to  each
      other  and  to  my  show.  If  you  keeping  sending  the  disturbing  pictures  and  the
      extra  bullshit  through  my  e-mail,  you  will  have  a  problem.  Ask  one  of  those
      retards  who  started  this  shit  , Graham  from  starbucks.    Oh  by  the  way  tell  that
      bitch  leshii  who  post  on  that  live  journal  site  nobody  wants  to  buy  her  piece  of
      shit  car.  As  for  you  dipshit  Andrew  or  whatever  your  name  is,  why  don't  you
      challenge  ziposhitoe  in  who  can  pull  the  most  scabs  of  each  other  and  who  can
      eat  most  of  each  other  shit  the  fastest.  That  should attract  most  of  your
      dropout  buddies  at  vcu.  The  only  BBQ  is  coming  out  of  your  mother's  ass  for
      you  to  eat.  Grab  it  fast  ,  before  your  buddy  ziposhitoe(amish  guzler) sucks  it  down.
