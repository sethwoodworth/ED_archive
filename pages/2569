E (prefix)
'''E''' is a letter that can be placed before anything to indicate that it takes place on a computer, if not the [[internets]]. Love, for example, takes place [[IRL]] between a guy and the poor girl he's trying to mouth [[rape]]; in cybarspace, the equivalent is e-love.

==Origins==
[[At least 100]] arcminutes ago, there was a nerd, who sent a message to another nerd. The nerds thought this was such a cool mode of communication that they dubbed it electronic mail. After realizing that no one on the internets could actually spell "electronic," they shortened it to e-mail. 

A [[revolution]] was born. Suddenly there was e-news, e-commerce, and [[Habbo Hotel|e-aids]]. TV execs thought it was so cool that they named a cable network that had nothing to do with technology E.

To this day, "e" remains popular on [[teh]] web. [[Camwhore]]s can find out if they are e-loved by how many things have been bought off their e-wishlists. E-[[Jameth]] has an e-ass that you can put your e-cock into and become e-gay. Adding e- to anything makes it [[at least 100]] times <strike>better</strike> e-gayer. Try it!

N.B.: Using this prefix to compile the word "e-nerd" is [[not]] advised, as it is considered [[redundant]]. If this troubles you, know that your [[attorney at lol]] is acquainted with this phenomenon!

e is going out of favor in these modern times for a lowercase i, which basically is marketer attempts to mimic the [[crap|iPod]] and [[AIDS|spread it super fast]].  Cyber is also new, with [[E-Bully]] getting replaced by [[i|cyber bully]].  This is probably [[Fox News|Fox's]] fault.
