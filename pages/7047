'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rodhullandemu Rodhullandemu]''' is a highly active [[Wikipedia]] administrator, and although he only became an admin around the start of 2008 (and as of the time of writing, has been on Wikipedia for less than a year), he's now a highly valued member of the [[Cabal]] for his [[intelligence|wisdom]] and [[bullshit|life experience]]. Indeed, Rodhullandemu is [[old]], possibly even older than [[OldDirtyBtard]], and thus Rodhullandemu is probably old enough to be [[you]]r grandfather.

Rodhullandemu is a retired [[lawyer]]. [[Some argue]] that he retired in mid-2007, after which he needed something to occupy his mind after several decades of mentally taxing work, and naturally, he turned to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Being the [[liberal|free thinker]] that he is, he wants to get the [[article]] on '[[cunt]]' to [[good article]] status, as proclaimed at the top of his userpage. He insists on pushing his POV that the UAF are indeed "anti-fascist", regardless of their alliance with radical-islam. He is also a massive fan of [[BLP]], directly quoting [[Jimbo]] at the top of his userpage. Encyclopedia Dramatica's advice is to smash up BLP at every possible opportunity; you should treat BLP the same way that a serial wifebeater treats his woman, because BLP is definitely one of the most [[faggot]]y of the [[Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines]]. Indeed, Rodhullandemu's entire userpage makes him out to be something of an [[asspie|intellectual]] with a [[mature]] outlook on the world.

He also has no qualms about [[deletionist|deleting articles]] whenever he feels like it, which [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&page=Omar_Williams may] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&page=Euan_G._Cameron may not] be the correct application of the [[criteria for speedy deletion]], but since he's an admin now, no-one questions his decisions when carrying out a CSD. Indeed, he is one of [[Grawp]]'s new opponents on Wikipedia, just like everyone else, trying to use their [[unwarranted self-importance]] as Wikipedia administrators (a power which can be taken away by any [[Bureaucratic Fuck]] for any reason at any time) in a [[epic fail|vain attempt]] at taking on the unstoppable [[beast]]. He made a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=224419843 recent post] on the [[administrators' noticeboard]] about [[edit war]]s on the [[Scientology]] [[article]]s. He said he didn't have time to attend to it personally for [[Deceased Wikipedians|health reasons]], though, just like [[Sceptre]] has been saying for the last few months because he is [[lazy]].

As his name suggests, Rodhullandemu has a particular affinity for keeping [[British]] [[television]] articles on his watchlist, particularly [[old|archaic]] ones, and reverts vandalism from them pretty much every day. 

Recently it was brought to the TOW community's attention that Rod has been editing under the influence. Yes, Rod has been driven so far into depression and despair that he has resorted to good ol' alcoholism. Constantly drunk, this scrounger gets up no earlier than midday (not necessarily a bad thing it has to be said), before whittling out brash, ill-thought out edits/reverts, coupled with amusingly incoherent/incomprehensible edit summaries. However, having been brough to the attention of TOW fags the matter was quickly brushed aside by TOW's inept and corrupt leaders. To this day, Rod retains his adminship, despite much controversy, including an ongoing dispute with another user (Malleus).

In general Rodhullandmeu fails at life. Having retired from law for being completely useless, this lowlife now spends it's time drinking/editing/scrounging until the early hours of the morning when he finally attempts to sleep (if permitted by his oh-so-considerate neighbours who populate the trashy council estate on which he dwells.)

Continued from the quote at the top…

{{quote|mostly [[Nick Cave|against the pricks]], and there are a lot of them around. How [[no life|desperately]] sad it must be for them that their [[13-year-old boy|fertile imagination]] seems [[fetish|predicated]] on [[lulz|hatred and jealousy]]. Such a waste. One day, maybe, they'll look back and realise how [[retard|utterly foolis]]h they are, but I doubt it. Meanwhile, I like a laugh; I've got the [[sysop|buttons here]], and they haven't. Silly kids.

Another quote:

{{quote|1=If [[Microsoft]] can implement "Don't show me this again", so should we. To take a hypothetical case, someone who's had their [[Desperate|Incapacity Benefit]] stopped and is living on even less than the [[Fail|National Minimum Wage]] as a result, yet still finds time to edit here for 50% of their life, for what it's worth, might find it insulting to be reminded on every page that someone else can spare money for things other than food or heating. --[[Wikipedia:User:Rodhullandemu|<span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000FF">Rodhull</span>]][[Wikipedia:User_talk:Rodhullandemu|<span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#FF0000">andemu</span>]] 02:03, 5 November 2008 (UTC)|2=It is rather obvious that when Rodhullandemu says “hypothetical case,” he is referring to himself.|3=[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=249772469 ]}}

Again:

{{quote|[[wat|Well that's more or less the dilemma we have here. Consider what our position would be if we were attempting a contemporaneous description of the life and work of Jesus Christ. The Romans and the Pharisees would be flooding the article claiming that the Galilee Chronicle is biased, the Bethlehem News didn't have a reporter at the nativity and therefore is unreliable, and The Times would be reporting "Hubbub in Middle East; not many interested". Seriously, though, we should realise that we are very lucky here in having available to us myriad sources, and our editing policies are predicated upon writing an encyclopedia intended to be informative and educational, and for all time. What we necessarily lack is historical perspective so cannot possibly judge what will appear important to future generations; having said that, all we need do is to reliably report facts, and possibly relevant opinions. Our descendants will judge by their own standards whether we got it right; their own descendants, if allowed access to our work here, may well disagree. We learn a lot about how our ancestors lived from The Paston Letters; maybe they weren't intended to survive, but survive they have, and we are arguably richer for it. It's all too facile to decry what we see as temporary, and unjustified, fame; but I guarantee we would know little of Robert Jenkins had it not been for the War of Jenkins' Ear. History can be a fickle master (or mistress), and we have no authority to prejudge it here. Let those who are transiently notable have their fifteen minutes; but if we record it, the database dumps ensure that somewhere, this is noted, and can be resurrected if their fifteen minutes turns out to be the most important quarter-hour in human history.]] I don't see [[Jade Goody]] fulfilling that purpose right now, but who am I to judge what my great-great-great grandson may find worthy of historical research? He certainly will have better evidence available to him than do I. Message Ends.|Rodhullandemu 23:01, 25 March 2009 (UTC)}}

In conclusion, this man is the scum of the earth and must be sent to Hell in the most graphic way possible on sight.

Look out for "Rodhullandemu Lib Dem POV-pusher" scattered all over Wiki. He asked for it!
