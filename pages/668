Astrima
[[Image:Schoolfattie.jpg|center]]
<br /><br />
'''Ass-trimmer''' (also calls herself "Trippy") is a 26 year old [[Suethor]] and [[Otakukin]] (Swedish for "and take cock in") cult leader whose eyeraping [[cosplay]] and bizarre [[pr0n]] has appeared on [[4chan]] numerous times.<br /><br />

==Child Raping Monster Clowns==

[[Image:Lolwhut.jpg|thumb|lol what?]] Astrima is probably best known for drawing this [[Twinks|blond]] [[fag|faggy]] purple guy with no nose and giant [[penis|horns]]. Apparently this monstrosity of [[faggotry]] is fanart of a [[crap]]py old [[video game]], only the thing Asstrima draws is a goth recolor of the real character. Naturally if any of the other [[fangirl|fangirls]] bitch about this they're shunned by Asstrima's small army of [[fantard|fantards]].

The games are allegedly about two monotone [[animu]] kids or two oddly [[Hitler|Aryan]] [[animu]] kids who look exactly the same who have some dreams about flying effeminate [[pedophile]]s to fight evil or something. It looks like a total [[suck|chick game]] which is probably why it was never popular.

==Lol Fanfiction For Realz==

[[Image:Marysues.jpg|thumb|left|lol [[Mary Sue|Mary Sues]]]][[Image:Fanficlol1.jpg|thumb|Surely a [[fanfic|masterpiece]] of this [[shit|calibur]] took 10 years of fine-tuning]][[Image:Comicsona.jpg|thumb|right|Why can't real life be more like [[anime]]? :-(]][[Image:Non-fiction-fan-fiction.jpg|thumb|left| She categorized her [[fanfic]] under "Non-fiction" on DeviantART]]One thing Astrima does treat like [[serious|serious business]] is a [[fanfic]] she's supposedly been writing for over a decade and yet only has [http://www.nightsintodreams.com/NiD/red/wtahbook/wtahbookindex.htm 2 chapters]. Despite that it's already very [[TL;DR]] if one does actually manage to read it for more than a minute without one's eyes crossing one finds it mostly revolves around writing about herself as an [[animu]] character. 

Along with this blatant self-insertion she has [[goth]] [[emo]] Sue named after her online screen name who boasts giant [[boobs]] and a lot of hideous [[Wtf|rubber clothing]]. Here's what she wrote about it before she baleted the page from her website:

{{quote|<small><small>As a person Astrima comes across as something of a Marysue badass who thinks of nothing but sex, fighting and all that other funny stereotypical stuff i like to poke fun at in fanfiction. But underneath the quieter Astrima lurks, the paranoid self conscious one. ... the one that somehow changed the NiGHTS in my dreams into a better person. That's the one that i'm more familiar with. She really can be quite a handful but''' i still feel blessed that i'm this crazywoman when i go to sleep'''. ... Whenever she's not trying to seduce people or about to have her head lopped off by some creature i really look up to her. She's shameless. She's everything my brain wants me to be and more. ... She's magical baby.</small></small>|Astrima, Her Sue is also apparently a half good-guy, half bad-guy [[vampire]] and some fantasy creature she [[Original character|made up]].}}

She also had a surprisingly talented drawing on DeviantART with the unfortunate drawback that its purpose is to reveal [http://web.archive.org/web/20060214082059/www.deviantart.com/deviation/6188833/ she KNOWS the Nights], she can see it [[IRL]], and it has nothing better to do than hang its purple [[fag|faggy]] [[ass]] around her bedroom.

She also puts a lot of friends in her first [[fanfic]] [http://www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/Display.pl?act=image&iid=63490 and] [http://www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/Display.pl?act=image&iid=63476 draws] [http://www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/Display.pl?act=image&iid=60538 shiny] [[Mary-Sue|Mary-Sues]] [http://www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/Display.pl?act=image&iid=56840 for] [http://www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/Display.pl?act=image&iid=56453 them] [http://www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/Display.pl?act=image&iid=55121 too] which is probably why she has so many [[fangirl|fantards]].

==Artwork==

[[Image:Ohgodohgodohgod.jpg|thumb|Her [[Mary-Sue]], her [[animu]] self, and some monster clown dude [[Rule 34]]'d]]Astrima's artwork shows more talent than most [[batshit]] [[fangirls]] but still has a lot of bad looking anatomy which is covered up by an overkill of shiney [[shit]] and big [[animu]] hair. Apparently she devotes her whole [[art]] (and life) to her most favorite video game and thinks the Nights is her imaginary friend and gives her all her inspiration and talent or something like that.

{{quote|<small><small>Kinda like my own rather manevolant personal angel. Sometimes it's more than my mind and gets a little frightening, and when that coupled with my Lucid dreams makes things utterly indestinguishable from reality, i take him as something i truely love. Recently we've been doing nothing but bitching at eachother, and as a result i couldnt draw. Normaly i can draw nomatter what, i just force myself to concentrate, but tonight we settled our differences and i can draw again. Mebbe even a little bit better. Thanks pal <3</small></small>|Astrima, on the demons in her head}}

She's also supposedly working on her own comic series that struggles to adapt all her [[fanfiction]] and clown [[yaoi]] to something original. No one knows what the hell it is or what it's about, but that hasn't stopped her from attempting to sell [http://www.lulu.com/content/1296543 ridiculously overpriced diaries] based on it.

==Website==
[[Image:At_eyerape.jpg|thumb|left|what]]
Astrima owns and operates her own website which is an ugly, graphic heavy horror bumming off [[Sonic CulT]]'s server. It looks like that kind of thing that was popular for geeky fan shrines and bad websites in general in the early 90's. Apparently most or of her [[art]] isn't [[canon]] but [[retard]]s from [[GameFAQs]] have mistaken it for real [[shit]], maybe because a 3D render of her [[goth]] [[emo]] [[Mary-Sue|uber-Sue]] version of the title character used to appear on the splash page. Looking through the site it doesn't look as if Astrima cares to make distinctions between her [[fanfic]] and the actual game which is hard enough to figure out what the hell it's about. 

There's also a [http://www.nightsintodreams.com/NiD/black/cosplay/NiGHTScosplay.htm section for cosplay] which provides plenty of [[lulz]].

Aside from her apparently some [[chav]] she's dating also updates the website, but it looks like his only purpose is to act like a [[wigger]] and provide [[rap]] songs about [[fag|faggy]] purple flying jester things for the website. He also showed how [[gangsta]] he is by spray painting the logo of a [[gay]] chick game on a wall somewhere and putting [http://www.nightsintodreams.com/NiD/gold/10thaniversary/digipage.htm pictures of it on the internet.]

Before this guy she is rumored to have had an [[internets]] fling with [[Sonic CulT]]'s resident [[pedophile]] [[Sonic CulT#Pachuka|Pachuka]]. She doesn't think he's guilty even though he [[Bubba|went to jail]] for molesting [[jailbait|little girls]].

===Forum===

Predictably the website also [http://www.nightsintodreams.com/forum/ has a forum] where a bunch of underaged [[weeaboo|teenaboos]] show their unwavering devotion to Asstrima-chan, read way too much into a series of [[shit]]ty video games, wonder why no one else likes games about gender confused clown monsters and BAAAAW about how they're the only ones who understand. They also hold lengthy discussions [http://www.nightsintodreams.com/forum//index.php?s=&showtopic=2307&view=findpost&p=49005 about how they've "converted"] friends and small children into their little monster clown fan cult. Asstrima herself also uses it to go on bizarre tirades about game companies and [[Shit nobody cares about| her personal life]].

==Cosplay==

how did i fat cosplayed to emo music?

===Sega Represent!!1===
[[Image:Omfgplushieiheartyou_by_astrima.jpg|thumb|I guess fat [[cosplay|cosplayers]] aren't just an [[American]] thing]]
Some time ago Asstrima was bragging that the one and only perpetually [[fail]]ing game company [[Sonic|Sega]] flew her to the other side of the UK so that she could stand on a bridge in her shiny goth recolor costume in order to give them free advertising at some Guinness Book of World Records most costumed [[weeaboo]] [[faggot]]s in one place event. [http://www.nightsintodreams.com/NiD/black/gbowr/cosplayrecord.htm They also forced her boyfriend to wear a Sonic the Hedgehog costume]. The most hilarious part is that the big multi-national corporation with plenty of money to spend on advertising and media events was too cheap to even spring for a hotel, instead allowing them to sleep in an unheated office overnight. 

Their only compensation in all this was some shitty Sonic the Hedgehog sneakers and some shitty [[Sonic]] tennis video game, which they obediently used to give the company even more free advertising by showing them off on their website. But like a couple of gullible [[teenager]]s being taken advantage of due to blind brand loyalty these two adults are happy enough with just the bragging rights they can impress 13-year-olds on the [[internet]] with.

==Fun Quotes==

Astrima has made [[at least 100]] journals during her time on DeviantART most of which are full of 20-something [[16 year old girl|teenage angst]], [[fangirl]] insanity and lots of [[lulz]]. Where it's impossible to go through everything (becuz she baleted them all) here's some choice quotes:

{{quote|<small><small>Because its pretty hard being inspired with anything when you've lived on tea and toast for 4 months since you last done shopping</small></small>|Astrima, on being a starving cow}}

 [[Image:At-cosplayplan.jpg|thumb|Can you see the differences in her plan for her costume and the final product? ('''HINT:''' [[fat|fattie]] denial)]]{{quote|<small><small>I like my relationship with my muse (not that she'd ever get told that) because i can be productive, free, flirtacious and not have to take all the shit that comes with regular relationships. I've had a lot of boyfriends and girlfriends in the past, its not like im lonely or anything. I fucking LOVE NiGHTS, he makes me insanely happy, makes me laugh my ass off, helps me in my life in more ways some regular 'boyfriend' figure ever could, he gives me huge confidence in myself, gives me my hopes and dreams and i'd seriously die for him.</small></small>|Astrima|Don't forget her "muse" is the Nights from the [[game]] she devotes her life to.

{{quote|<small><small>Then there's the fact that John tried to make me chose between my artwork and him. I chose my artwork and found that i nolonger could hold onto either ... John torments me because he's that one part of the puzzle that was supposed to make my life all peachy. But i sidestepped it.

Not the fact i didn't have the guts to but WHAT WERE SEGA THINKING leaving this unregistered for so long??? I got upset by their lack of attention to the most incredible game in alllll living history and decided to 'safeguard' it for them until they want it back. ... So when Sega ask for it back i shall give it to them instantly, quite happily infact. On the condition that they release more stuff from the original game to the public and fans, like character art. .. So what i'm saying here is, i'm not stealing the name, i'm not even going to claim it's my websites name.

==[[Flounce|I'M LEAVING FOREVER!]]==

Well Astrima has pulled a typical DeviantART move and [[Delete fucking everything|baleeted her whole gallery]] and [[Flounce|left devianTART]]. She has [[irl|A LIFE]] outside the [[internet|INTERNET]] and is going to spend it maintaining her websites.

[[Image:AT_LEAVING4EVAH.jpg|center|thumb|Astrima's surprisingly boring LEAVING 4EVER journal]]

A lot of the links to her [[shit]] are broken now but [[anonymous]] doesn't really care. Some have been updated with other sources for your approval and [[lulz]].
