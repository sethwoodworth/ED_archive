[[Image:WeAreTheLegion.jpg|thumb|More Anonymous Borg.]]

The '''Anonymous Borg''' are a relatively recent [[newfag|mutation]] of [[Anonymous]]. Like [[The Borg]] - the [[hivemind]] alien race bent on universal [[pwnage]] in ''[[Star Trek]]'' - they suffer from huge amounts of [[unwarranted self-importance]] and [[unrealistic expectations|a superiority complex]].

These [[anon]]s gone [[aspie|rogue]] have decided that they speak for all of [[Anonymous]]kind because [[SFB|THE INTERNET IS SERIOUS BUSINESS]] and [[HAHAHA|they know what's best]] for [[anon]]. Meanwhile, it is [[columbine|well documented]] that [[basement dwelling]], [[13-year-old]] [[virgin]]s with no [[IRL]] friends couldn't organize a [[drunk|piss-up]] in a brewery and should have their Internets confiscated by [[Al Gore]] until their [[puberty|balls drop]] and they stop [[1337|playing]] in their <s>[http://xyndros.ath.cx/index.php/Tasks tree fort]</s> LOL DOWN.

==[http://www.geocities.com/kakamafive/reply.htm Mission]==

Their main [[faggotry|mission]] (apart from [[i|/i/nsurgency]] in general) is to recruit [[downs|like-minded]] spastics into a '''personal army''' to unite all [[Anonymous]] - from [[4chan]], to [[7chan]], to [[420chan]], to [[Jackie Chan]] - into an organized force with a [[I|"central command"]] and uniform [[LOL WUT|"thinking"]]. However, like a [[Nazi|fascist]] dictatorship, the [[retards|"brain trust"]] of '''Anonymous Borg''' has already [[Rules of the Internet|decided everything]] and debate and dissent is not an option.

==[[Serious Business|Delusions Of Grandeur]]==

'''The Anonymous Borg''' like to tell [[moot|site owners]] how they should run their [[brb, soup|sites]] as if they were [[The man|the board of directors]] at a '''Fortune 500''' company. Whilst they contribute [[butthurt|little-to-nothing]] content-wise and [[poor|nothing financially]], they will [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=User_talk:Pokchu/AddresstotheState&diff=prev&oldid=1997242645 not be denied].

:<i>In the following [[lulz|"morality play"]], the part of [[unwarranted self-importance]] is played by [[User:Kakama5|Locutus_of_Lulz]] and the [[soup|Soup Faggot]] is played by [[moot]].</i>
<pre>
<Locutus_of_Lulz> We are Locutus of Anonymous
<Locutus_of_Lulz> You will respond to our questions.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> Your use of a public IRC network is less efficient for Anonymous and to you.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> We have established a large and stable network, just for Anonymous
<Locutus_of_Lulz> Lulznet.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> irc.lulz.net
<Locutus_of_Lulz> aka irc.partyvan.org aka irc.lulzhost.net
<Locutus_of_Lulz> It is the combined servers of many chans.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> 7chan has joined, fapchan as well; 420chan will when they update their server software.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> the /i/nsurgents built it off our several servers.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> The Patriotic Nigras have added their servers.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> Great things are afoot.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> We will await your return
<Locutus_of_Lulz> But we know that moving #4chan onto the central node is most efficient for all parties.
<moots> not happening
<moots> irc is stupid
<moots> go away
</pre>
Later, that same day:
<pre>
<Locutus_of_Loli> We do not wish to hinder the progress of 4chan
<Locutus_of_Loli> But we must sadly attack until /b/ conforms to the will of Anonymous.
<Locutus_of_Loli> We shall double the dataforce.
<moots> uh okay
<moots> i am going to go make soup now
</pre>

==Tactics==

*Are not afraid to use [[1337]] [[h4x0r]]ing techniques (like [[gigaloader]]) having mastered [[Computer Science III]].

*Will [[DDoS]] their own species (like black person cannibals will eat the educated white man, or themselves) in order to [[:Image:420posts.png|endear themselves]] to the [[chan]] community at large.

*When '''Anonymous Borg''' 'speak' (usually thru [[IRC]]), you'll notice the [[faggot|mouthpiece]] in question will use the royal "we" as in: <i>"We needs to go potty, brb."</i>

*When issuing [[bullshit|fatwas]], will emulate [[V]] and [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=User_talk:Pokchu/AddresstotheState&diff=prev&oldid=1997242645 verbalize voraciously] like vindictive and villainous vipers.

==Analysis==

[[Image:Anonymous_Borg_Hitler.png|thumb|right|Either [[Hitler]], one of the first AnonBorg, or an AnonBorg wearing a Hitler-mask.]]

Soon to be grounded by their [[parents]], these idiots are not much of a threat but extremely effective at creating [[X-box|huge]] amounts of drama and [[FAIL]]; and thus [[EPIC LULZ]].

By violating many of their own (very gay) [[Rules of the Internet]] their whole "point" is rendered [[moot]]. 

By trying to organize [[chan|chaos]], they show a limited understanding of how the Internets <u>and</u> [[IRL]] work. They also seem to [[English is not my native language|speak English as a second language]] since they don't seem to understand what [[B|"random"]] means and/or (being the namefags they are) the nature of the "anonymity". Not that Anonymity works on IRC.

They also [[fail it]] at marine biology, since trying to localize [[copypasta|piss]] in a [[4chan|sea of piss]] is impossible.

In short, they should all <s>[[gb2]] [[Gaia]]</s> get the fuck off the Internets, [[gb2|gb2school]] and focus on becoming [[bureaucratic fuck]]s when they [[puberty|grow up]].

In the meantime, they should be made to watch Anon's favorite film - ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' - until they understand [[shit nobody cares about|how to inspire and stir the collective consciousness into giving a shit]].

==The Argument for and against Anonymous Borg==
FOR:
If anon could be organised in a single place then they would be better placed to react to [[Marcab Confederacy|recent events]] and [[for great justice|injustice]] 

Against:
LOL ORGANISED Anon! and if it needed anymore toxic webspace then you can [[7chan|start]] [[4chan|an]] [[888chan|other]] [[retard|chan]]

==The Truth About Anonymous Borg==

[[Image:AnonBorg.jpg|thumb|right|On sighting this, Cruise called the [[Church of Scientology|CoS]] to enter lockdown mode. The transmission was intercepted at stardate 9420.7.4-711.]]

In reality, the [[Caturday Nap|prior affairs]] were [[It was a social experiment|a front.]] Anonymous Borg are the alien spies who maintain the advanced alien neural interface between the German Secret Service, psychiatrists, Nazi-Commies and the fleets of the [[Marcab Confederacy]]. They are the advanced sentient computers that make up Anonymous' [[hivemind]] network. The plot was blown when Tom Cruise was checking the skies with his telescopes in fear of Xenu, and caught a glimpse of an Anonymous Borg Cube returning to the dark side of the Moon. Undeterred, the Anonymous Borg will continue to pursue the destruction of the Church of Scientology, the last resistance, and allowing Xenu to return to restore order to the galaxy.

The Collective has failed; with lazors charged and aimed at Tom Cruise, we prepared for the final blow, but many freshly assimilated Anonymous at this point [[Enturbulation|split off]] and formed their own group dedicated to stopping CoS [[moralfags|peacefully]]. The Anonymous Borg now seek to work with the Church of Scientology to destroy such arrogant rebellion against the Collective, and will be beaming aboard a CoS near you to have a talk about how we can best cooperate for our [[lulz|mutual good]].
