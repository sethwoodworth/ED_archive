The '''brain''' is an [[cock|organ]] found in our heads. Theory has it that the brain may be an incredibly complicated [[computer]], with more possible neural connections than there are molecules in the universe. However, this theory is not considered rigorous, as it fails to predict why people are really fucking [[stupid]].

A brain will get you into Mensa, where you can meet interesting people with similar interests, for example; [[Hitler]]. A brain, however, will not allow you to access the internet. Lack of brain is needed for that task, because otherwise you'd have something better to do with your life, you fucking loser.

The brain can be safely removed surgically. It costs about 17 USD to have your brain removed in Guangzhou, China. Survival rates post-surgery, however, are extremely low. Only a few have lived to tell the tale, such as Captain Ahab, Pete Doherty, and King Henry. 

This operation is required in most [[Christian]] denominations.
