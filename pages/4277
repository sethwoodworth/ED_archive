'''Jennifer Emick''' is a [[self injury|self-styled]] [[otakukin|'alternative religion guru']], [[fanfiction|writer]] and [[Attention Whore|internet troll]]. She suffers from [[internet asshole|delusions of grandeur]], believing that [[schizophrenia|everything she says]] is [[Politically Correct|infallible]], whether or not she has [[dox]] to back it up.  After being fired from her [[altporn|job]], she began spending all her time attempting to convince everyone else that the moderators of [[thunderdome|WWP]] had been infiltrated by [[magoo|OSA]], the [[your mom|CIA]] and [[Reptoid|Reptilians]]. She accomplished this by [[Arguing on the internet|changing her story]] whenever someone asked her a [[Good Person Test|question she couldn't answer.]] Thus, her [[cumdumpster|reputation]] as a [[lulzcow]] was established.  Eventually it led to rebellion by her [[X is not your personal army|personal army]] of [[retards|assburgers]] and [[whores|emotionally fragile women]], resulting in even more [[butthurt]]. [[cougar|Jennifer]] is currently going from [[Christian Boy Love Forum|forum]] to [[Gay Teen Forum|forum]], trying to get someone to listen to her [[Mary Sue|fantasies]].

Jennifer is an [[expert]] in the field of [[goth|alternative religions]] and a Grade AAA [[Internet detective]].  [[The Google|Extensive journalistic inquiry]] reveals that she was a [[almost raped|big deal]] in the [[At least 100 years ago|20th century]]. Jennifer "spent [[Time paradox|some time]] in [[Internet University of Doctorism|college]]," has a [[Main Page|Wikipedia]] article, has been on [[G4|television]] and [[attention whore|actually believes]] that "for some reason, millions of people are interested in what I write."

Jennifer's greatest work to date is [[shock site|About.com's]] Guide to Alternative Religions by <s>Jennifer Emick</s> Catherine Noble Beyer, the interloping biatch who slid into Jen's rightful place as queen of the realm, forcing Jen to set up her own alt religion website and put a wicked hex on her usurper.  Her extensive professional experience at this internet thing and her mastery of magick have demonstrated that she is both an [[Stalker|expert haxor]] and an [[Witch|expert hexor]].

===Jason, Both Full And Wider? Doubtful.===
Jennifer married Jason Fullenwider on June 13, 1999.  When asked if her husband had changed his last name to compensate for something, Jen giggled nervously and said [[Yes|no]]. [[Fat|"Fullenwider"]] is a centuries-old German name.

==Oh Hi, Jen! How's Your SeX Life?==


Jennifer and her [[internet tough guy|bro]] [[Raziel]] used to run an [[cult|internet forum]] called [[Nonfluffypagans|Scientology Exposed]]. SeX pretended to be an anti-[[Scientology]] forum but was really just a haven for [[Crazy|insane]] [[fatties|pagans]] like Jennifer and her [[faggot|galpal]] [[Retard|Raziel]]. All was great in the palace until Jennifer decided to go a little crazy with the [[AIDS|magick]], and [[Raziel]] [[rape|demodded]] her. Despite having been [[Pwnt|bitch-slapped]], Jen still harbors a grudge against the people from [[thunderdome|WhyWeProtest]] who caused [[Raziel]] [[butthurt]].

==Enter Trollology==
[[Image:Jenoz.jpg|right|thumb|200px|upright=2.0|Jen, Mary sue, Drifter, Relyt, Timthephoto]]
Hanging out on other people's forums wasn't working for Jennifer because [[Nazi|mods]] just couldn't stop themselves from insisting that the posted content be at least [[Logic|somewhat plausible]].  Because of this unreasonable [[fursecution|persecution]] she founded [[fucktard|trollology.com]], "an [[xenufag|anti-Scientology]], anti-Gamestop, [[pretty cool guy|anti-teabagger]], [[you|anti-everyone]] forum."  With the new platform, Jen and her [[gay|merry]] band of [[Lolscenequeens|gullible retards]] could continue their [[loldongs|important]] work of [[Fail|shitposting]] and [[Prank call|prank calling]] [[Darr|Scientology]] without having to worry about the restrictions of [[Old meme|being funny]] or [[Logic|being entertaining]]. Good luck visiting [[derp|www.trollology.com]] as they didn't hack the [[gibson|vhosts]] enough to get <i>http://</i> working.


As a [[dipshit|moderator]] of [[White People|trollology]], Jennifer avoided the rigorous self-serving [[Rules|moderation policy]] of other websites like WWP. She edited only [[Delete Fucking Everything|every single post]] and banned only [[Internets|those who disagreed]], however slightly, with her.  As [[newfag|admin]] of [[faggots|trollology.com]], Jen was able to craft the kind of [[Irony|positive and nurturing environment]] that reflected her spirit as a [[redneck|mother of multiple children]].  In observance of her maternal status, any mention of her [[CP|children's existence]] garnered <s>a visit from</s> dire warnings about the imminent arrival of the [[Party Van]].

===Shortbus Force===  
The shortbus, driven by Jennifer Emick, brimmed with the most [[Gullible|asinine and retarded individuals]] who ever lived. Some say the shortbus is no longer in service because it [[An Hero|caught fire]] during one of Jennifer's wannabe [[Harry Potter|Yoko Ono]] [[Dungeons & Dragons|witchcraft ceremonies]]. [[Fact|Others claim]] that it [[divided by zero|imploded]] when Jennifer tried to [[Asking for it|maneuver her absurd machinations onto the information highway]]. In reality, by virtue of her [[magick]] powers, the [[Girl on the Internet Syndrome|tenaciously vindictive cunt]] zapped the shortbus, transforming it into a submarine. This event, occurring <i>in the 20th century</i> and yet of biblical proportions, undoubtedly inspired [[I_did_it_for_the_lulz|John Lennon]]. 

===The Great Conspiracy! Magick with a K===
   
[[Image:GlenBeckJen.jpg|thumb|Left|upright=2.0|<center>Glen Beck explains it to us</center>]]
In the summer of 2010, Jennifer's [[Magick|incredible perceptive powers]] allowed her to single-handedly [[Cycle_of_Blame|unearth]] several deep cover moles among the WWP mod staff.  Jen [[Coast to Coast AM|revealed]] that WWP staff members included the entire population of g00ns.net, perennial [[Chanology]] villain [[Tom Newton]], several [[IRC|OSA]] spies,  CIA Agent 4223, and an emissary to the [[Raptor_Jesus|reptoid race]], Shishcala.

The first mole that Jennifer uncovered was [[Kevin Mitnick|theswellseason]].  Jen discovered that theswellseason is an [[Internet celebrity|infamous]] [[G00ns|g00n]] who will [[White Knighting|stop at nothing]], not even [[Skript kiddie|DDoSing]] the entire Internet, if someone so much as thinks about [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|doxing her friend]].  theswellseason is guilty of having once [[Trolling IRL|met some people]] Jennifer doesn't like.  Also, she has a [[Sand-filled vagina|vagina]].  Jennifer determined that theswellseason once had a conversation with [[Crybaby|JanusZeal]], a former [[711chan|enturbulation.org]] [[fag|moderator]] and Scientologist-in-disguise who [[ramen|sold the Enturbulation database to OSA]], resulting in [[Magoogate|every single person who ever had an account on enturbulation.org being fair gamed]] by [[Scientology]].  To back up her [[bullshit|claim]] Jennifer provided absolute [[JEWS DID WTC|proof]] that she and other Trollology members were the targets of [[The Internet is serious business|devastating DDoS attacks]], despite theswellseason's clever cover of being on her [[Marry Your Pet|honeymoon]] the entire time.

In response to [[Intellectual Checkmate|these revelations]] by Jen, the entire staff of WhyWeProtest and some other drunk, bored [[pussies|Xenufags]] decided to put a cap on the liquor bottle and go [[lan party|raid]] Trollology.  The "[[Troll|scorched earth terror campaign]]" waged by WWP staff included such [[moralfag|unscrupulous]] methods as [[God Awful Fan Fiction|shitposting]], [[Drunk dial|calling Jennifer's house at a reasonable hour]], and [[DESU|politely]] asking her to [[tits or gtfo|back up her claims or stfu]].  

Jennifer [[Nerd_Rage|responded]] to this in the most [[Insane|rational]] way possible.  She bravely [[Edit war|edited every single post]] calling for accountability, threatened to [[IM PRESSIN CHARGES|press charges]] for wiretapping and [[Lonely|sat by her phone]] awaiting [[Phone sex|"harassing calls"]].  Her [[Bawwwww|measured response]] [[Semen|culminated]] in putting Trollology into [[Baleet|maintenance mode]] so that [[Waaaambulance|no one could read or say anything bad about her]] while she was asleep.  Shortly after this campaign began, the hosting company for Trollology [[Banned|realized]] that pictures of [[raver|huge penises]] and "[[Cybersex|pretty much the entire website]]" were against their terms of service, and the Trollology account was [[Ban fucking everyone|dropped]] like a cougar's deflated sweater puppet.

[[Image:Dox-Jen.jpg|left|thumb|upright=2.0|<center>My Opinion Trumps Your Call For Logic.</center>]]

The second [[Bothan spy|mole]] in WWP's staff was uncovered when Trollology came back online under a different host the next day.  The staff member dun goofed by [[Leet|forgetting to hit the TOR button]], using only [[7 Proxies|6 proxies]] while [[Camwhore|shitposting]] on Trollology, and [[YHBT|his IP was revealed]].  Jennifer's incredible [[Hacking|Internet magick]] allowed her to geolocate and sniff the slightly dynamic IP off the bounce with a high degree of accuracy.  She [[paranoia|managed to determine]] that the poster was the only person ever to use Comcast in Albuquerque and must therefore be none other than the persistent and consistently incomprehensible Chanology troll [[Rorschach|Tom Newton]].  Following this [[conspiracy theory|stunning revelation]], the second incarnation of Trollology collapsed only minutes after going online, having suffered a massive influx of one user who made all of [[u mad|one post]]. <s>It is still down to this date</s> The hackers finally decided whether they would run [[Lunix|Debian]] or [[Ubuntu]] and brought the forums back online.

The third mole in WhyWeProtest staff that Jennifer uncovered was [[16 year old Japanese schoolgirl|Azazel]].  Jen spent several hours [[sniffing|sniffing packets]] and [[David Icke|"Just Googling It"]] Azazel, and [[Obsessive|skillfully]] exposed the [[conspiracy theory|disturbing truth]].  Despite Azazel's [[Ragequit|retirement without incident]] from WWP staff prior to being discovered, Jennifer determined that he was in fact a [[fat|magickal]] [[Angry German Kid|German]] [[Zero Cool|super-hacker]] who worked for the [[Basement|government]] of [[Iran]], the [[Basement|government]] of [[Russian|Russia]] and [[the Man|the CIA]].  He was also employed by agents of [[Cult|Scientology]] through his [[your mom|contact]] in [[Washington, DC|Douchelandia]] and liked to play the [[Quake|original]] [[Unreal Tournament]].  

Jennifer proceeded to [[Spam|post her findings]] on every website from which she hadn't been banned for being completely nuts, and sent the link to everyone on every buddylist she had ever seen.  The news that a former WWP moderator was a fan of a [[vidya|game]] released in the 20th Century [[boring|rocked]] the Chanology world, and Chanology responded to the overwhelming evidence against WhyWeProtest staff by [[LOL WUT|not giving a shit]].

==Jennifer, a Renaissance Man==

Jennifer has a [[Starcraft|deep]] and [[meh|nuanced]] understanding of the [[DDR|tubes]] and possesses a vast arsenal of [[IRC|high tech]] gadgetry such as [[WHOIS|geolocation services]] through which she can [[internet_stalking|determine your position]]. Some of those services are so [[Ethical Hacker|advanced]] that she claims they [[Stick It In Her Pooper|detect proxies]] and [[Fellatio|sniff the bounce]].  Or, in [[Cory Doctorow|layman's]] terms, [[Is Your Son a Computer Hacker?|"Oh My God I Don't Know What I am Saying."]] 

===The Storyteller===

[[Image:Jennifer_neverending_story.jpg|right|thumb|upright=2.0|<center>Never <s>Ending</s>The Same story</center>]]
 
Jen is a [[Drama queen|gifted storyteller]]. When she's not having her windows shot out by nazis, she  likes to kick back over a beer and tell people about how she's quoted in college textbooks and even appears as a "pointless" entry in <i>Gimme Something Better: The Profound, Progressive, and Occasionally Pointless History of Bay Area Punk from Dead Kennedys to Green Day</i>. Unfortunately, when telling those stories Jen too often uses her own voice, which has been known to curdle milk.
 
===The Collector===

These days, Jennifer is a professional and very capable collector. She collects copies of [[porn|other people's art]] and publishes them on SymbolDictionary.net. She also collects [[Fucktards|sycophantic followers]] who will take her at her word no matter how divorced from reality she may be.  She's very good at collecting seemingly random and entirely unrelated pages of  the internet that she likes to call "[[Docs|dox]]" - a  technical netspeak term that Jen will define more fully for us all in her anxiously awaited book: <i>The Everything I Need You to Know For Now Book: Read The Whole Fucking Thing Before Commenting</i>, by Jennifer Emick.

Here's a snippet, courtesy of Jen's publisher: "There are no 'dox' for an opinion. An [[bullshit|opinion]], by definition, cannot be wrong." - JCO/PL 23/7/10.


===Big on Wikipedia [citation needed]===

Eventually About.com management got fed up with this demagogue's ramblings and sacked her. Jennifer then assumed a commanding role in the internet copyright taskforce. Her daily <s>crimes</s> duties included altering Wikipedia articles and filing false DMCA claims in order to build links to her Ebaum-style, Satan-worshipping [[Art_theft|pirated image]] collage, AKA symboldictionary.net. When advised that her actions violated Wikipedia philosophy, rules and guidelines, Jennifer characteristically did <s>not</s> throw a tantrum and attack Wikipedia users, mods and admins like a [[Ayn Rand|menopausal pitbull]]. Had this not occurred during the 20th century, it would have been a major déjà vu.

== Conclusion: Got a Death Wish? ==

Jennifer is an endless source of lulz.  She will, until the end of time, remain combative and default to cop-calling.  She will never cave in.  She will spew lies and spin and chaos forevermore. 

Trolling Jennifer: Cheat Sheet and Consequences.

'''Calls'''
<br>
Jennifer records every incoming phone call, but this does not constitued permission to record her--it is, after all, a felony and Jennifer will press charges. You'll know she's butthurt when she disconnects her phone.

'''Posts on Trollology'''
<br>
Jennifer suffers from obssessive-compulsive post editing disorder.  It is rumored that she once edited a lorem ipsum post into a possible threat.

'''Children'''
<br>
Jennifer loves children and is a very protective parent. Mention children and she will immediately fly into a rage and call you a pervert / pedophile and or predator, and will threaten to backtrace you and bring justice upon your sorry ass.
