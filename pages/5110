{{quote|No girl thinks I'm cute. I'm repulsive. I'm hideous.|The only truthful thing he has ever said.}}
'''Maddox''' is one of the pioneers of internet [[troll]]ing, [[flame|flaming]], and [[unwarranted self importance]]. At least he was this person four years ago. Despite his shtick being so yesterday, he is still a pioneer of [[lulz]]. [[Noob]]s should read some of his early articles to learn how to flame, but not anything post-2005, because that is when he started to take himself seriously and his writing really went to shit. 

Most non-[[retard]]eds will notice much of what Maddox has to say is [[unfunny|unfunny]] in the way that it points out [[obvious]] [[shit nobody cares about|things]] [[internets]] users already know.  He is also a [[faggot|pirate]].  He makes that very clear.  A little too clear.  In fact, his many claims of being a pirate, coupled with a trend of no longer updating his site have worn pretty thin.  He also wrote [[The God Delusion|a shitty book]] recently, and an [[sonic|even shittier comic]]. 

Some (including Maddox himself) claim that he is indeed a STRAIGHT pirate by throwing in exaggerated claims of his sexual ability. This is known as "[[trying too hard]]" and it isn't fooling anyone.  His failure to come off as a badass is best revealed from pictures of himself.  Everybody has learned that he is nothing more than a neckbeard-wearing, basement-dwelling, shell script programming, raging nerd.

==Early Life==
[[Image:People111.jpg|thumb|left|Young Maddox vacationing with his parents in [[England]].]]
[[Image:Maddox2.jpg|thumb|One of Maddox's childhood heroes.]]
For the majority of his childhood, Maddox lived in poverty, sleeping only in a dilapidated house of [[Santorum|mud]]. It was during these harsh years that Maddox developed his tough [[boring|personality]] and his love of [[homosexuality|manliness]]. Maddox likes [[cock|beef jerky]], [[semen|vinegar]], lumberjacks, [http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=i_ate_my_neighbors_kids eating babies], and headbutting [[emo|pussies]]. He also has extremely [[unwarranted self importance|high self esteem]] and is [[masturbation|in love with himself]]. He has a terrible taste in movies and video games and defends it by calling people fags.

In [[college]], Maddox had a brief but passionate affair with Ronald McDonald. Since their breakup, Maddox has had a virulent hatred of [[McDonalds]] and constantly criticizes them.

Maddox claims to be a [[pirate]], but since he lives in the landlocked state of [[Mormon|Utah]], it's more likely he means an [[ass pirate]].

Maddox may be a software programmer, and he may be into everything else associated with [[basement dwellers]], but that doesn't necessarily make him one. He was finally able to vacate mom's basement after selling [[over 9000]] books last year, now he lives in luxury, on the money he conned out of stupid people like [[you]].

Additionally, Maddox is also a [[camwhore|camera whore]] as evidenced by his numerous pictures of himself on his [http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/images/dem0n1.gif website] and the image to the right.

Maddox hasn't worked at a real job since 2004, making all his money selling merchandise [http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060504/news_1c04badboys.html] and beating off on drunk hobos for cash.

==Examples of his work==

{{quote|As I was sitting here drinking my beef jerky flavored Tabasco sauce I couldn't help but think about how great I am. I mean, look at me! My site gets more visits than [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken's]] site, never mind the fact that my site is the only one that's not an advertisement. It almost makes me feel better about my tiny, tiny penis, but just to make sure I just punched an infant in the vagina to validate my manliness and superiority over you assholes. Speaking of that, fuck you pasty Internet fags, it's not like you contributed to my success or anything. And how about those women? Always...bitching, and shit.|An article from mid-2005}}

==Maddox's Formula to a [[Shitty|Successful]] [[Blog|Article]]==
# When thinking of ideas for topics, the first things that should come to mind are minor and meaningless things that make you get your panties in a bunch.  Examples of this include people who use hashtags on [[Twitter]], people who only prefer cheese on their pizza, or people who listen to [[ska]].  If it bugs you to the point of insomnia, then you're [[winner|doing it right]].
# Begin writing [[over 9000]] paragraphs worth of ranting crap where every other sentence must contain juvenile insults directed at the subject, such as [[Gorgeous George|shitheads]], [[dipshits]], [[fucking]] [[idiots]], etc.  Also, be sure to throw in plenty of slang for male and female genitalia.  It cancels out any attempt at sounding witty and clever, but don't tell Maddox that!  He thinks he's [[No|funny and smart]]!
# Draw some shitty MS Paint pictures to illustrate the inane, psychotic rant people quit reading 2 paragraphs in anyway.
# Slap your e-mail address at the bottom of each page, ignoring the fact that you've pissed and moaned endlessly about your idiot fan base who won't quit e-mailing you.
# Insert a counter at the bottom of each page, implying people beyond 1999 still [[Nobody|give a shit]] about how many views a page received.
# [[???]]
# [[PROFIT!]]  Now you can quit giving away most of your writing for free on the Internet.  This is your chance to go fail at other projects, like books, and a poorly-produced [[YouTube]] show.

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> In your writing, don't try to come off like a normal, respectable human being.  Keep reminding your readers that you rule the world, your opinions are right, and everyone who disagrees is wrong.  This is to compensate for your ugly physique and small penis while you sulk on [[IRC]] with your [[naive]] [[friends]] who are convinced you're a [[pussy|manly]] [[faggot|pirate]] in your mom's basement.  Additionally, remember that this is <i>your</i> outlet to being a crybaby bitch instead of working out your problems the proper way, such as seeing a [[Dr. Phil|counselor/therapist/psychiatrist]], going outside, finding a [[girlfriend]], winning a fight with someone bigger than you at a bar, or just plain quit being a fucking pussy!

==Book==

[[Image:Maddox homosexual rape.jpg|thumb|Maddox puts a man into a choker hold for some homosexual rape.]]

{{quote|Why should people buy anything I sell? I don't know why anyone should buy anything|Maddox}}

Maddox has released a book, "The Alphabet of [[Man]]liness". As a skinny, old, Armenian computer programmer from Utah, Maddox is an authority on [[faggot|manliness]]. The book was published in an effort to cover the cost of the huge quantities of Nair needed to remove his disgusting back hair. The book skyrocketed on the [[new York|NY]] Times Bestseller list, an embarrassment to all parties involved. Covering a variety of subjects ranging from [[gay|how stupid women are]], to [[fag|how great men are]], to specific instructions for cooking meth, "The Alphabet Of Manliness" is a prime forerunner of everything that was [[unfunny|never funny]], even through shock value. The book also mentions [[old meme|Chuck Norris]], making him as funny and edgy as the average shirt in [[Hot Topic]].

Maddox goes on tour promoting the fact he would sign women's breasts.  FUN IDEA: Bring your grandmother and have her request it. 

Since he began writing it, he's stopped updating his site.  After it came out, <del>his site only serves to promote his  damn  book</del> he apparently updates only once every <s>four months</s> couple years or so, leaving his retarded fans with a thirst for moar.

When approached by Amazon.com inquiring as to what price his book should be sold at, Maddox replied, "About a million dollars, [[srsly]]."  Amazon did not think this was funny and initially refused to stock the book. Since then though Amazon now sells new copies of the book for $10.85.  With each book sale, he makes no money.  Not only has Maddox failed at convincing people about how manly he is, he also fails miserably at the game of [[capitalism]].

==Show==

On December 9th, 2008, Maddox announced that all of the time he spent not updating his website was not only devoted to [[Masturbation|jacking]] it to [[hentai]] and being a [[basement]]-dwelling loser, but also spent on developing his own show, dubbed uncreatively [[Doug|''The Best Show in the Universe'']].  News of the show, which is set to air on [[YouTube]], came via an update on his site, in an article where he heavily criticized YouTube for being full of [[shit]], coming in only 3 years behind everyone else on the Internet in this endeavor.

Finally, after almost two years, Maddox finally managed to do what [[13-year-old boy]]s, [[retard]]s, [[faggot]]s, and [[Chris-Chan]] managed to do in a matter of days, if not hours: post a poorly-made video to YouTube.

<center><youtube>JBiQE4hjOsk</youtube></center>

The "show" is basically a redux of his article criticizing children's artwork from almost 10 years ago.  This article is Maddox's main claim to Internet fame and he clings to it as the foundation of his [[gay|manly]] personality.  This time, he focuses on criticizing children singing on YouTube.  Maddox is [[obvious|significantly less humorous]] when you can see his receding hairline and [[AIDS]]-patient physique on camera.  The fact that it took him two years to [[shit]] out this steaming pile of [[unfunny]] just goes to show everyone exactly how far beyond the shark Maddox has jumped.  [[PROTIP]]: Claiming to be a manly pirate lumberjack only works when people can't see that you're actually a scrawny, balding computer programmer in real life.  It's a pathetic compensation.

==Fan Sites==
As with all retarded things in the world, they usually have a fan site. Maddox is no different, having two of the gayest fan sites ever. Maddox Mania and The Best Fan Page In the Universe are where intelligence goes to die.

===The Best Fanpage: Poster Child For Failure===

Recently, an ED insider did an in-depth investigation of "The Best Fanpage," revealing some disturbing yet unsurprising things about Maddox fans:

*The forum staff are closet [[furfags]], as evidenced by [http://www.thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=70655#70655 this] "[[Bullshit|April Fool's joke]]."
* [http://thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=9450&start=0 Pedophilia and homosexuality] are rampant amongst Maddox fans.
*Maddox fans are [http://thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=11464&start=0 socially] [http://thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8501&start=0 inept]. (Topics baleeted, [http://thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=11858&start=0 probably out of butthurt])
*They're also [http://thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=10501&start=0 anime] [http://thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=9369&start=0. fags].  [http://thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=9684&start=0 Jesus] [http://thebestfanpageintheuniverse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3202&start=0 Christ].

Also, [[Something Awful]]'s Weekend Web did a [http://www.somethingawful.com/d/weekend-web/bittorrent-japan-maddox.php?page=8 segment] about the site, causing the members to [[BAWWWW]]. Whine-One-One was dialed, and [[Waaambulance|waaambulances]] were dispatched immediately to handle the epidemic of [[butthurt]].

==[[Ninjas vs. Pirates|Ninjapirate]]==

[http://www.ninjapirate.com Ninjapirate] is one of [[Over 9000]] shitty Maddox ripoffs.  Unlike most of them, Ninjapirate managed to generate a few minor [[lulz]] by mocking skateboarders.  Eventually, he got one of them to send him hatemail.

Much like Maddox himself, the quality of Ninjapirate's page went downhill after the first couple years.  Not to make it sound like Ninjapirate was any good in the first place.

Ninjapirate's real name is Thilo.  He is a [[retarded]] [[azn]] [[leftard]] who isn't even ashamed of admitting he's a fan of [[Michael Moore]].

Flaming Ninjapirate usually results in a "Thanks for the traffic!" or something else retarded, because apparently it doesn't matter if traffic is there solely to view how much of a moron you are because hey, it's traffic.

{{squote| You keep saying that you know that you're copying Maddox, that you know he's better than you, and that you don't care. Well guess what? Nobody cares that you don't care, your site still sucks. Do you know why? Because, in reality, you're not copying Maddox at all. He doesn't just arbitrarily write pointless bullshit; his articles have meaning, and if they don't (as in his "huge balls" article, their pointless humor is at least funny and not meant to be taken seriously). He complains about certain things because he has a sense of standing up for what he believes. He believes in people thinking for themselves. Despite what he says about always being right, he doesn't want people to blindly agree with him, but to have their own opinions and have wills of their own. If you were simply trying to copy the look of his website, that would be fine, but you are poorly trying to copy his attitude and are failing because you are missing his very point! |James Parsons|[http://www.ninjapirate.com/newhate.html telling Ninja to GTFO]}}

In Ninjapirate's defense, at least he knows that [[Jews did WTC]].

==[[Reddit]] AMA==
At the end of January 2010, [http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/avkcv/i_am_maddox_ama Maddox decided to reach out to all the arrogant nerds on reddit], due to his fanbase completely forgetting about him for not updating his website often to their liking.  The members of reddit [[cum|came]] all over the post, asking him all kinds of stupid questions that have been answered [[over 9000]] times and pretending to give a shit about [[Hentai|what he's up to]] as his excuse for not updating his website.  There were also many other jealous nerds who wish people gave a shit about their opinions more than Maddox's, so they decided to try their luck in [[fail|flaming him]], but failed miserably.

==Maddox gets trolled by Penn Jillette==
[[File:Maddox.png|thumb|right|250px|Part elitist. Part fag. 100% [[manboy]].]]
On July 29th, [[2010]], Maddox stumbled into what will no doubt be a self-publicized [[Andy Warhol|15 minutes]] he'll milk for the rest of his life (an [[old media|actual 15 minutes]], not a [[Internet famous|fake 15 minutes]]) when he was spotted on an episode of [[Wikipedia:Penn & Teller: Bullshit!|Penn and Teller's: ''Bullshit!'']] during a segment they did on "[[Old people|Old People]]".  <s>({{youtube|MaaMAstcSrE|partial vid only}})</s> don't bother, it's set to private. [http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5726255/Penn.and.Teller.Bullshit.S08E08.HDTV.XviD-SYS Go torrent it]

It's unclear [[fellatio|how this happened]].  But, seeing as the show's research department was probably busy lighting their farts that week, some retard on the staff (who probably thinks they're [[newfag|internet saavy]] because of it) thought it would be a good idea to [[irl trolling|irl troll]] a slew of [[unfunny]] internet [[blogger]]s, who whine about [[nothing|anything and everything]] they're [[butthurt]] about, to posit a possible geratric [[holocaust]].

<center>'''Penn's Response'''</center>
[[File:Penn stfu.gif|thumb|right|Penn's response.]]
During his screen-time (a whole 1 1/2 minutes!), Maddox's eagerness to somehow achieve [[unrealistic expectations|God-tier status]] from P&T's [[fanboi]]s seems to have been a bit of a [[footbullet]].  The overt [[lulz]] of all of it seems to have flown over Maddox's ([[bald]]) head altogether, but wasn't lost on Penn, seeing as Maddox is, himself, clearly in denial about being...just fucking [[lamer|old]].  Penn proceeded to counter-[[troll]] his ass, describing him as a [[faggot|blogger]] who is "[[O RLY|no spring chicken]] and spouts [[old meme|predictable]], [[RAGE|angry]], [[old|middle-aged]] [[nerd rage|manrants]] on [[SNCA|just about everything]]", along with some other lulzy shit before they literally told him to "[[GTFO]]".

==Other Maddoxes==
*'''LJ Maddox:''' The [[LiveJournal]] account {{lj|user=maddox}} is held by a [[retard]]ed [[13 year old boys|thirteen year old boy]] from [[Italy]] who updated it once [[at least 100 years ago|a long time ago]] inquiring about male prostitutes who were also [[video game]] experts or [[whatever]]. [[Lulz]] ensued.
*'''[[what|PokeMaddox]]:''' There was a [[troll]] on the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Pokemon]]-themed board. He incidentally was also called Maddox, but he retired, since people called him to wash his tits.
*'''[[John Solomon]]:''' is sometimes accused of being Maddox. This is a [[lie]].
*'''Dross:''' [[LOL WUT|A Latin/white]] <s>ripoff</s> '''troll''' that shamelessly copied Maddox's page format and whole Modus Operandi ([[h8|h8 mail]], [[shitty art|fanart]], and the rest). He's in his middle 20's and is '''[[unfunny]]''' to bacterial proportions. Also, a [[great justice|self-proclamed macho and racist]] that, in South America, is [[over 9000]] more overrated than in [[America|the US]]. [[shit nobody cares about|Born in Venezuela, resides in Argentina since 2007]]. Loathes [[you|every single social group in history]], to a point of rejecting to be remotely related to any; he has an enourmous e-go and even copied Maddox catch-phrase "How much I rule" and deformed it.
[http://dross.com.ar/ChantaArgentino.htm "El otro día demostré lo increíble que soy con un chanta argentino"] translates to "The other day I demonstrated how incredible I am..." (Nitpicking anyone? lulz).
He writes [[video game]] guides for those idiots that cannot access or are too [[fucktard]]ed to use Google, [[lulz|but his work has been stolen for other magazines]]. [http://www.dross.com.ar/plagio.htm SRSLY]. He could be a troll for the [[win]], but he thought that, being not so retarded as those who read his site, falls in the [[fail]] category. [http://dross.com.ar/ Si usted habla español, hágale una visita]. Dross is also a douchebag of epic proportions, as is shown in this article where he brags how better he is and how true he is to his internet persona in comparison of Maddox and Toobis based on his muscles: http://www.dross.com.ar/Competencia.htm. *UPDATE* Dross has publicly declared interest in having anal sex with Maddox (srsly) and cannot longer be considered a ripoff since he has declared his Internet persona is a character and is doing the whole thing for the lulz. [http://www.dross.com.ar/entrevista21octubre.htm SRSLY]. 

*'''Daniel Isaac:''' Another clone of Maddox with the same Modus Operandi. It would be nice to write something [[lulz|lulzly]] about him, but it would be repeating Maddox history, but without so much space. Yes, he is that [[lame]]. [http://individual.utoronto.ca/daniel_isaac/index.html Daniel Isaac's].

==Fun Facts==

* Maddox likes transsexual Thai boys, [http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=thailand Proof].
*As is well known, Maddox is a homosexual. But a lesser known fact is that he is also gay. This means he is in fact a fag².
*Is probably [[Jewish]] IRL.  Would explain a lot.
