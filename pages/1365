Cast Fetish
'''Cast fetish''' is a kind of fetishism with an erotic concentration on orthopedic casts (plaster, polymer, bandage, etc.) It is usually related to the fetishes of feet, stockings, shoes and [[amputee]]s< (<--WTF??). The sufferers usually like the opposite gender [[Asking For It|wearing casts on their limbs, using crutches, or limping around]]. Sometimes, socks and stockings will increase the attraction of the afflicted. This travesty of a fetish is illustrated by the increasing popularity of injured dolls in [[Japan]].
