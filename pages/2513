'''E-go''' - a major part of the online ''[[Wikipedia:Id|id]]''.
 
Someone who is said to have a [[NORP|normal]] e-go will probably be shy and retiring when met [[in real life]].
 
Then just think how the e-go is affected by someone who has a massive ego IRL - Take [[Jimbo Wales]] for example, if he was to show his true e-go then [[internet disease|he'd be posting badly photoshopped pictures of his face embossed in gold everywhere]]; oops, too late.
