[[Image:Kersal_Massive.PNG|thumb|200px|'''The Kersal Massive''' ([[GTFO|-1, lol]])]]
'''Kersal Massive''' was a video/YouTube meme that was started by three poor, young [[UK]] chav [[faggots]] named MC Mack, Little Fuckin' Kev and [[Ginger]] Joe. They became internet famous in the UK by being known as the first rappers that the [[Younger Woolwich Boyz]] were scared to have a rap battle with. While they were quickly laughed off the [[internets]] forever, their shitty rap was played over and over again on [[Old media|British radio]]; which caused [[Bulling is rabbit|bullied teens]] and [[Unfunny|comedians]] across Britian to make videos taking the piss out of them. Originating from the sunny land of Kersal (somewhere between Isengard and Manchester) they are hoping for the [[Anal|big break]] by making cheap videos on their mobile phones; and uploading them for the [[lulz]].

==The Crew==
'''MC Mack:''' An albino thing that has [[FAS]], and huffs [[jenkem]] because his pot dealer is [[Dead|swimming with the fish]]. He is a neo-Nazi and [[BJ|gloryhole]] expert because of his thin snake lips. 

'''Little Fuckin’ Kev:''' A crying midget who looks like he has been ass fucked by the Younger Woolich Boyz on a daily basis. With a constant look on his face that says “[[Mitchell Henderson|All I wanted was an iPod]]"; his face is red due to the high concentration  of [[AIDS]] and cider running through his veins.

'''Ginger Joe:''' [[Ginger|A FUCKING GINGER KIKE]] who can’t rap.
