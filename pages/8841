Not all Vulvae are the same. While some are friendly and approachable, others can be difficult or impossible to catch. Some are very quiet and tight-lipped, others are incredibly noisy and are always open. Others smell like fish that's been left out in the fucking desert sun for a week. Nevertheless, even the inexperienced trainer can understand Vulva with a little research.

Vulvae can often be seen roaming the countryside in herds, known as ''lots''.
