''Twas the night before Christmas [[2008]], when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; the stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that Santa soon would be there; The children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of <s>sugar-plums</s> hollow point bullets danced in their heads.''

Santa [[Tony Stark]] Claus, howevar, had different ideas. Claus, aka '''Bruce Jeffrey Pardo''', was a [[bitter|merry]] old man who gave [[Americunts]] something they had been missing all year; [[cho|a massacre]]. Unlike past years, when America celebrated [[in style]], 2008 had been relatively corpse free (except for [[TARP|bankers and real estate agents]] who jumped from windows after [[W]] [[accidentally]] the whole economy). Mr. Claus -a devout [[Christfag]]- usually volunteered to serve as an usher at his [[helLA]] church's Midnight Mass during the festering season, but this year, he volunteered to '''[[IDIFTL|shoot an 8-year-old- girl in the face]]'''.

It was family tradition that every year a neighbor would dress like [[Santa Claus]], knock on the front door and disperse presents. Clad in his traditional red and white [[raidfag]] suit, he then went on to spread [[lulz|tidings of comfort and joy]] to the packed Christmas party at his [[bitch|mother-in-law]]'s house like some kind of deranged [[MacGyver]], opting out of the usual [[capitalism|commercialism of Christmas shopping]] in favor of making his own gifts; like the [[flame war|home-made flamethrower]] covered in glittery wrapping paper he brought along .
 
==Naughty or Nice?==

Santa ('''sɑːt ʊˈn''') opened fire as he entered the house, first shooting an [[loli|8-year-old girl]] who answered the door '''[[Headshot|in the face]]''' with one of his five semi-automatic pistols. He then managed to [[pwn]] nine people and wound several more, including his [[16-year-old]] fat and sassy stepdaughter (who he shot in the back), his in-laws and most of their family before burning the house down with Napalm on a chilly Christmas Eve in Southern California.

{{quote|There's some information that he stood over them and shot them execution-style.|Covina PD}} 

However, the Xmas Eve merrymaking came to an abrupt end when Santa [[fail|burned both of his arms to a crisp]] during his indoor firework display. He actually managed to [[lol|melt and fuse the Santa costume to his flesh]]. At this point, he abandoned [[WIN|Plan A]] - which was taking the first sleigh out of town to [[Canadia|the North Pole]] with $17,000 he'd made by [[buttsex|manwhoring]] that he would've duct taped to his ample waistline - and went to [[FAIL|Plan B]] - driving 40 miles with 3rd degree burns to his brother's house, breaking in, and becoming [[an hero]] by a single shot to the head.  [[An Negro|At least he didn't miss.]]

==The Motives==
The former [[Bill Nye|aerospace engineer]] had no criminal record and nothing in his personal history to suggest a predisposition to [[pwn]]age.  Unless you count the [[Maddox|retarded kid]] nobody knew about, that he'd abandoned as a boy, but was still claiming as a dependent on his income taxes, that is. It appears that this amiable, upstanding Christian pillar of the community had deserted his former [[g/f]] with their son, who'd sustained debilitating brain damage as a toddler when he [[Habbo|fell in the pool]] whilst dad was watching football on TV instead of watching him bob for apples.  Oh, and when his wife found this out, that's why she divorced him.

They finalized their divorce on December 18th and she got $10,000 a week in alimoney, her wedding ring, and -[[NEVAR FORGET|most devastating]]- getting Pardo's beloved [[dog curtains]].  Pardo only got the house, which he had to make payments on.  Oh and speaking of paying alimoney and mortgage, Pardo had been [[unemployed]] since July when he was fired without severance and was ineligible for [[Welfare|unemployment benefits]].  When December came, he was around $900,000 in debt and that's the legal system.  Pardo also [[crybaby|complained]] in a [[Internet Law|court declaration]] that Sylvia Pardo was [[Basement dweller|living with her parents]], [[luser|not paying rent]], and had [[Jew gold|spent lavishly]] on a [[Unwarranted self importance|luxury car]], [[Hookers and blow|gambling trips to Las Vegas]], [[fat|meals at fine restaurants]], [[List of sex moves|massages]] and [[Carlton|golf lessons]].

When asked to comment, [[eHarmony]] issued a statement: "[[WTF|Shit happens]]."

{{quote|[[HAHAHA|He was just the nicest guy]]. He always had a smile. [[Lies|It's a shock.]] A shock for anybody who knew him at the church.|Jan Detanna, fellow [[Bitch|usher]] at the [[Shit nobody cares about|Holy Redeemer Catholic Church]]}}

==The Aftermath==
{{quote|How dare he shoot [[jailbait]] and [[loli]] without rape, its just not done.|/[[b]]/tard}}

There were 25 guests at the party and nine had been unaccounted for immediately after the shooting. The Los Angeles County coroner's office said that some of the bodies were [[oven|so badly charred]] from [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|dying in the fire]], that [[Dental Plan|dental records]] would have to be used to [[dox]] them. Along with his nine confirmed kills, Santa left a bunch of orphans in his wake after pwning most of his wife's family during his rounds.

{{quote|The entire family was wiped out. There's basically, like, 16 [[Retards|orphans]].|Wife's lawyer}}

[[Last Thursday]], a rented car parked outside the property was discovered to be loaded with 300 rounds of ammunition and a [[ATHF|pipe bomb]] that had been [[nigrigged]] to take out first responders. The [[Exploding Van|car was blown to hell]] after bomb disposal experts moved in and discovered the trip-wires.

{{quote|I heard he had two guns. We need the stats on the guns, ammo and kill ratio to consider Santa Pardo for legendary pwnage status.|/[[b]]/}}

But ol' Satan Nick's story reached beyond just the internets. The Jews running Hollywood were apparently so moved by this tragedy, that they dedicated a film in memory of Mr. Pardo.
