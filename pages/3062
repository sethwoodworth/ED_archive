'''Fred Bauder''' is a sixty-year-old [[Fail|failed]] [[wikipedo]] [[sick fuck]] [http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic=8861&view=findpost&p=86078 gman] attorney and member of the [[Wikipedia]] [[cabal]].  Unlike most other cabal [[cock|member]]<nowiki>s</nowiki>, he is not a [[Kelly Martin|transsexual]], does not like to dress up in women's clothing, does not support the legalization of [[pedophilia|childlove]], and is not a fat chick.  Fred Bauder is also a member of [http://www.wikitruth.info/index.php?title=Oversight_%28Or_Lack_Thereof%29 The Magic 28], meaning he has the power to permanently delete page revisions without a trace.

However, he has solicited [[prostitute|prostitution]] from a female (a shame it's not legal), which resulted in him being [[banned]] from practicing law in the state of Colorado.  He has spun this situation and misled people to believe that he "retired" from law practice. [[Jimbo Wales]] sure knows how to pick 'em.

==Caselaw excerpts==
Fred Bauder was [[internet license|licensed]] to practice [[law]] in [[Colorado]] in 1976. He [[fail]]ed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the [[internet court|hearing board]] entered a default against him. The allegations of [[fact]] contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See [[tl;dr|C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People
v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997)]]. Based on the default and the [[evidence]] presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by [[proof|clear and convincing evidence]].
----
On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for [[whore|prostitution]] during a phone call with [[MONGO|the wife of a dissolution of marriage client]]. See [[tl;dr|People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997)]]. Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the [[Bantown|Office of Disciplinary Counsel]] and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a [[legal action|request for investigation]] was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation.
----
It is hereby ordered that Fred Bauder is suspended from the practice of law for thirty days, effective thirty days after the issuance of this opinion. It is further ordered that, prior to seeking reinstatement and as a condition thereof, Bauder shall pay the costs of his [[list of sex moves|1997 disciplinary proceeding]] in the amount of $2,058.97 plus statutory interest from August 14, 1997, to the [[Attorney at lol|Attorney Regulation Committee]]. Bauder is further ordered to pay the costs of this proceeding in the
amount of $124.11 within thirty days after this opinion is announced to the Attorney Regulation Committee, 600 Seventeenth Street, Suite 200 South, Denver, Colorado 80202-5432. Bauder shall not be reinstated until after he has complied with C.R.C.P. 251.29.

==Totally loses his shit==
Due to lack of sex from solicited prostitutes, on September 23, 2007 Fred [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FAttack_sites%2FProposed_decision&diff=159883198&oldid=159882811#Redirect_to_Clown totally lost his shit], and suggested redirecting ARTICLES on Wikipedia about people that "harass" [[Wikipedos]] to the article for '''[[clown]]''' in payback. Other wikipedos immediately [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFred_Bauder&diff=159883977&oldid=159883412#Proposed_arbitration_decision_10_on_the_Badsites_Arbitration_Case called for his head], and all of Wikipedia exploded in a nuclear jewlocaust.

==Fake "Alternative" Wiki==
[[Image:Wikinfo user list.jpg|thumb|left|Lol, Wikinfo.]]
[[Image:Bobo doll.jpg|thumb|[[Grawp]] vs. Fred Bauder.]]
Despite being a [[Wikipedia]] [[cabal]] member in good standing, Bauder has also founded a [http://www.wikinfo.org/ fake alternative wiki-based encyclopedia] as a means for extracting steam from [[Jimbo Wales|Jumbo's]] fuck up. Supposedly differing from the Wikipedia in having a 'sympathetic point of view' policy, the site is transparently a means to distract good-natured folk who may have something to say away from [[wikipedia|ToW]].

Despite the fact that Wikinfo's [[Alexa]] rank is about [[100]] times less than that of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] (even check it on Alexa for yourself), <s>[[TOW]] allows an article on Wikinfo and not one on ED, despite the fact that Wikinfo has got less third-party coverage. Hmmm... [[hypocrite|double standards]] anyone?</s> (Latest update: [[BDSM|The Roles have been Reversed]]!) Wikinfo policy was also changed due to [[Grawp]] and [[Hagger]] as well as a rollback-breaking-script which was used on the wiki. The vandalism got so much that they restricted pagemoves to sysops and required all new editors to confirm themselves via email before being able to edit. This combined with their [[article]] being deleted from [[TOW]] was a double [[pwnage]].

==Old man Fred confirms it!==
The old fuck confirms it:
*19:31, 27 August 2007 Fred Bauder (Talk|contribs) blocked "Miltopia (Talk|contribs)" (account creation blocked, e-mail blocked) with an expiry time of indefinite â€Ž (Turns out he was a sock of Blu Aardvark)

ED is a reliable source on TOW editors! Fred is also a close personal friend of the Scifag [[Terryeo]]. For yur entertainment...

==The way this works==
In Scientology we expect how wonderful it is and in Scientology controversy how they awful it is. User:Fred Bauder|Fred 15:03, 21 April 2008 (EDT)
:Very well Fred but should Terryeo (Scientology OSA) post his drivel I will contest it. He was thrown off Wikipedia and several other sites for it and I confront their plants at every instance.
::'''He is an administrator here and a respected member of the community.''' User:Fred Bauder|Fred 00:09, 22 April 2008 (EDT)

This from Freakazoid Freddy in regards Wikinfo, home of the Scilon Empire (ok, stop laughing!!!) I was instantly banned btw.

==Fred vandalizes ArbCom!==
For no apparent reason and as usual without as much as a trace of explanation Fred decided to blank an ArbCom page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Allegations_of_apartheid/Workshop&diff=prev&oldid=157314285]. Not even when asked for an explanation by an ArbCom clerk [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFred_Bauder&diff=157408710&oldid=156998539]. Is senility finally getting the better of old fuck Fred? Or is this just another example of Fred doing whatever the hell he wants?

==ALWAYS redirect Fred Bauder to Clown==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Attack_sites/Proposed_decision&oldid=160158623#Redirect_to_Clown Fred likes clowns a lot]. So, always redirect Fred to "Clown"!
