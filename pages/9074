'''Wiktionary''' is the [[cock|dick]]tionary [[incest|sister]] project of Wikipedia. It is much less reliable than [[UrbanDictionary]]. It is apparently ruled by a Mormon [[pedophile]] named Connel MacKenzie, because he wants a smaller pool to swim in where there are no [[wikipedo]]es and he can watch closely for any paddling children.

In summer 2006, great [[drama]] ensued as sysop Dangehrous ([[Lol dongs|Dong]]herous) was desysopped and banned indefinitely for vandalism by Connel MacKenzie. Dangherous was a sockpuppet of [[User:Wonderfool|Wonderfool]], who was desysopped a year beforehand for the same reason. In response, they created large numbers of attack usernames against another admin, Vildrici-[[anus]]. This arse-related vandalism led to an indef-block on all AOL IP addresses, ushering in a new era of drama and lulz. Since then, Wonderfool managed to get re-sysopped and re-de-sysopped, this time in April 2008 under the name Keene[http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=Keene&page=&year=&month=-1], making a hat-trick of deletions - 3 time in 4 years. Today, any new users who seem to know what they're doing are accused of being a Wonderfool [[sockpuppet]] and are swiftly [[ban]]ned, leading to a dearth of good new contributors. Also, the Wiktionarians are shitting themselves about the thought of Wonderfool returning to the world of adminhood, with a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Votes/sy-2008-12/User:Equinox_for_admin#Discussion witch hunt] for some asshole called [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Votes/sy-2009-03/User:Equinox_for_admin Equinox], but despite a [[CheckUser]] continuously proving them wrong: [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Requests_for_checkuser&oldid=5764163], [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Requests_for_checkuser&oldid=4932676], they are paranoid. But then WF did it again as [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=&page=Wiktionary%3AMain+Page&year=&month=-1 Jackofclubs]

SemperBlotto is another idiot who spends his whole time browsing Wiktionary and blocking "stupid" vandals.

Wiktionary is also extremely boring and unfunny. If you think Wikipedia is bad, it's got nothing on Wiktionary in terms of its potential for boring the shit out of [[you|the reader]].
