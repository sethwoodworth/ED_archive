K채pt'n Balu Und Seine Tollk체hne Crew
'''K채pt'n Balu Und Seine Tollk체hne Crew''' (Captain Balu and his Brave, Foolish Crew) is a [[German]] [[Youtube]] meme, based around the surreal [[furfag]] Disney show Talespin. There is little to say about the show itself, except that it was about the characters from The Jungle Book flying planes. No, [[seriously]]. [[LOL WUT|Shere Khan the tiger flew  a Messerschmidt.]] It was nearly as odd a spin-off as that thing where [[Gary Coleman]] was an angel, or Baywatch Nights.

The meme itself consists of setting Talespin's German theme, which happens to be insanely bouncy and catchy, to violent or inappropriate visuals. Bonus points are given for anything involving planes, and for synching the video to the lyrics.
