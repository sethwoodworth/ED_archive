'''James von Brunn''' was the perpetrator of a [[antilulz|not very lulz]]-worthy shooting at the [[Holocaust]] museum in June of 2009. It is safe to assume he was made [[an hero]] by cop due to the fact that he was 88 and was only sporting a .22 rifle. He only managed to kill one black person rent-a-cop. 

==The Man Behind the Rifle==
James von Brunn was a diligent [[Nazi|far right radical]] who gave us the enlightening work 'Kill the Best Gentiles'. Not only did he hate [[Jews]] and was constantly in league with [[Neo-Nazi]]s and Holocaust-deniers, but he was also a [[Birther]]. Brunn's life was one of hard lessons learned at the hands of getting the shit kicked out of him by bullies, his time in the Navy on a PT boat, and quite a bit of jail time. All of which he basically blamed on the [[Jews]] that pulled the strings of the world to make his life [[Hell]].

Brunn was reputedly also an artist doing majestic western scenes and those involving a buffalo and an eagle. It is highly likely that he was a closeted [[furfaggot]] whose mind finally collapsed in on itself inspiring him with this plan.

==Brunn and the [[v&|Law]]==
Brunn's first stint in jail was only a year for assaulting a [[v&|cop]]. His second stint however, was six and a half years in [[Federal]] [[homo|pound-me-in-the-ass prison]] for walking into the Federal Reserve with two guns and attempting to take some board members hostage. Rent-a-cops appear to be this man's kryptonite as one catching him on his way in with a bag with the weapons in it completely screwed all of his plans. He attempted to appeal the conviction but of course the Jews kept his ass locked up. [[truth|The idea of this plan was to force society to pay attention to the way which the Federal Reserve rapes us with interest rates manipulated by bankers.]]

His last interaction with the law was shooting a rent-a-cop dead at the [[Holocaust]] Museum in Washington D.C. In itself this is not all that [[lulz]]y, though some of the shit surrounding him from those that knew of him is.

The above was said in defense of the Holocaust-denying Institute for Historical Review. It is difficult to figure out what the point of an armed Jew hater going to a [[Holocaust]] museum and shooting up the place is. It certainly was not for the [[lulz]]. After 88 years Brunn must have been able to figure out that he would have killed a lot more people sitting outside in his car and just shooting people as they exited.

Brunn died later at the hospital after being shot twice in the head with return fire.
