'''Ilija "Zmaj" Grahovac''' also known as the '''Dragon of Sipovo''' is a multiply awarded cattle breeder from Cifluk, a small village near the town of Sipovo, in the republika srpska in [[Bosnia]] a former republic of Yugoslavia, which has undergone a few minor management and structural changes since the early 90ies (as seen on Tv).

Ilija Grahovac, well known for a healthy dose of insanity, in sipovo and the sorrounding area, rose to fame and became an [[internet phenomenon]] through a few short videos which emerged from the internets (around 2005) showing excrepts of a strange but awesomly funny speech Ilija held some time ago.
Later it was revealed that the whole speech had an unbelievable lenght of over 3 hours and was held at the funeral of Ilijas father Jovo, in front of ilijas shocke family.
After a few [[fan]]s, from the area, have managed to smuggle DVDs with fan-made covers and title "Kome smeta junacka Rjec?" into local video-stores, the wohle epic speech became available on the interns.

The content:
-Ilija, after his uncle refuses to do so, starts to hold a speech about his deceased father.
-Ilija talks about the (orthodox) church
-short intermission, Ilija is greating his neighbor Pero.
-Ilija talks about geometerics and allotments.
-Criticism of the ustasha and muslims
-Apologies for the said above, cause some ustasha and muslims are present at the funeral
-Ilija talks about a horse ride, the good Dr.Karadzic, the geology of the Vojvodina, a hatchet which was owned by his father, all the weapons he has at home,...
-Someone interrupts the speech, and now Ilija starts to yell at the people arround him.
-Nearly everyone has lost their nerves cause they think the speech is far [[tl;dr|too long]], and people are demanding Ilija to come to an end and bury his father.
-Ilija strongly refuses to do so until he has ended his speech.
-His aunt tries to intervene, but is verbaly bitchslaped by Ilija

After the speech became popoular on the internets Ilija was interviewed by the media where he showed that he is either a great entertainer or a “Budala”  which means batshit insane in nearly every country on the balcans.

To show that he has humor and is even more crazy than people assumed him to be, Ilija made a second Video (Dioba) in which he shows how he and his brother divide their heritage… cattle, what else. This second video is also filled with speeches Ilija held while drinking his brain into oblivion and talking about trivial and [[SNCA|important topics no one cares about]]. 

==Pr0n==

Now there are rumours about a third film a porn-movie in which Ilija plays a leading role. The existence of this last movie is <s>not</s> [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1808755270794540152# confirmed] but Ilija is known for satisfying 6 women in 6 hours, beside being a cattle breeder he is a sexmachine too.Don’t ask about the connections.
