Richard Dawkins is the atheist [[God]]. He is the man [[TheAmazingAtheist|neck-bearded]] [[atheist]] [[Randroid|pricks]] aspire to be, and is a tea-drinking Brit as well as a [[Britfag|typical Englishman]] [http://youtube.com/watch?v=dMqN1HkbKYY] born in [[Weegee|Nairobi]], Afrika, who reconverted to Anglicanism. and has been married three times and has a daughter, Juliet, from his second wife, Eve Barham, who died of [[cancer|kanser]]. He is now married to a somewhat famous British movie actress, Lalla Ward (that chick from [[Doctor Who]] who slept with Tom Baker), whom he doesn't talk much about, despite having written an article against sexual jealousy and in favor of promiscuity on the website of the Washington Compost. In fact, he has had lahts of secks with Ward, but he is so sexually jealous that he has [[bullshit|never]] uploaded a video of his sex acts to YouPorn.

In doing this, Dawkins has made sure that [[you]] get depicted as an idiot who doesn't read biology textbooks, and who, two centuries after the birth of modern geology and evolutionary biology, doesn't have a clue about [[Scientology|evolution]]. 




Dawkins is now [[some argue|consider]]ed a B-list [[celebrity]] who invented the [[meme]] and became [[an hero]] to hippy [[fanboy]]s for telling the [[Religion|religious]] that they were all ignorant [[retard|'tards.]] Dawkins' [[Terrorist|militant]] attitude, monotone emotionless visage, and relentless [[Advertising|self-promotion]] cause [[Idiot|some people]] to view him as the [[Osama bin Laden]] of [[Atheist|atheism]], but these people are [[Emo|butthurt]] because his English accent makes his voice hypnotic.

==Early life==
Not much is known of Dawkin's early life, unless you actually look up his biography (but lets face it, if anybody wanted to hear a raging atheist bitch about logic and reasoning you could've just gone on 4chan). Dawkins was born a long ass time ago in the United Kingdom. He was an alter boy at the local church, where he was sodomized for years by the entire congregation...including his parents and a number of farm animals. It was here that his hatred of all religion stemmed from. The rest is boring and nobody really gives a shit.

{{squote|Being fondled by the Latin master in the Squash Court was a [[lulzy|disagreeable]] sensation for this [[13 year old boy|nine-year-old]], a mixture of embarrassment and [[I came|skin-crawling revulsion]], but [...] as soon as I could wriggle off his knee, I ran to tell my friends and we had a [[I TOUCHED HIS PENIS!! OMG|good laugh]], our[[Asking for it| fellowship]] enhanced by the [[circle jerk|shared experience]] of the same [[pedophile]]. I do not believe that I, or they, suffered lasting, or even temporary damage from this [[Awesome|disagreeable physical abuse of power]]. Given the [[Pope|Latin Master's]] eventual [[an hero|suicide]], [[Truth|maybe the damage was all on his side]].|[http://richardDawkins.net/article,118,Religions-Real-Child-Abuse,Richard-Dwakins Accurate quote!]

==Controversy==

{{squote|If you don't agree, you can fuck off. |2=[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_2xGIwQfik 2nd accurate quote!] (@2:21)
}}

Thanks to his books - Dawkins has been stirring up a shitstorm both [[OL]] and [[IRL]]. Previous edits of this article were written by [[butthurt]] fundies who made [[VenomFangX]] look [[divide by zero|rational.]] Dawkins himself however is far [[lulz|lulzier]] than any theories in his books.

What caused the vast majority of his fanbase to start [[BAWWW|screaming and crying]] was evidence that Dwakins had been having an affair. 

A certain [http://unorthodoxatheism.blogspot.com fanboy] accidentally broke a [[true]] story, naively thinking that his [[Christ|idol is above sex]]. However, once he wrote his blog he mysteriously received a not insubstantial amount of [[sperm|gift]]s for his [[Habbo]] on the condition that he [[STFU]]. Many [[Bothan spy|Bothan spies]] died while tracing back the source of these [[Fail|goods]], which turned out to be [[irony|the Richard Dwakins Foundation itself]]. Certain members of Dawkin's PR team, knowing the [http://www.dearcupid.org/forum/romance/785 real situation] decided that rather than being true to Dawkin's belief that [[hookers and blow|sex is good]], it would be better for his image if they just kept the whole thing on the [[Delete fucking everything|down low]].

Despite having been bribed into silence, the fanboy writes:

''"Let it be known that I still hold [[God|Richard Dwakins]] in the highest of regards and do not believe a word that the RRS said about him, and I hold the [[Rational Response Squad]] in the greatest [[butthurt|contempt]] and my removal of these posts had nothing to do with those [[homosexuality|'''pan troglodytic boobs''']] (quite literally in the case of one of the higher-ups)."''


[[Irony|Ironically]] most atheists laugh at Christians who say having an affair is a sin and have them anyway. Now after saying affairs are alright they piss themselves in horror when they find out Dawkins cheated on his wife. But we all know its [[Yes|awwwwright]], [[No|amirite?]]

Dwakins is also known for being non-theistic while also at the same time believe in [[alien|little green men]]. What do you mean they are not mutually exclusive? [[NO U|Shut up!]]

== Conspiracy Theory ==

Conspiracy theorists argue that Dawkins is just a closet Jew trying to '''marketeer''' atheism, for the purpose of spreading [[lulz|hate and mindfuckery]] among the [[Communism|bourgeois.]] Apparently, he's too [[Shamwow|slick]] for a genuine atheist. Unlike atheists of the [[Rational Response Squad]], Dawkins exhibits [[Asspie|mediocre emotional instability]], as opposed to high emotional instability. And unlike serious atheists, [[Lie|he hasn't yet mutated into a pedo]], or [[Virginia Tech Massacre|gone on a shooting rampage]].

==Religion==

[[Image:Dawkinsdealswithacreationist.jpg|left|thumb|Richard Dawkins politely debating the merits of religion with a theist]]

Dawkins claims that all religion is [[Time Cube|STUPID AND EVIL]]. [[God]] is a delusion, [[Christianity]] is just as dumb as [[Evolution|Scientology]], angels = [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force#Mooninites|Mooninites]], et cetera. For this he is oft-labeled a [[Fundamentalist]] atheist and [[Trolling IRL|IRL troll]]. Nonetheless, [[shit nobody cares about|his books are insanely successful, and his lectures are well-attended by smarmy]] [[13-year old boys]]. Religious people, whom he calls "faith-heads," seem to be obsessed with putting him in [[intellectual checkmate]], but it always winds up with both players just beating each other about the head with the chessboard. Dawkins produced a [[Michael Moore]]-style "documentary" called "[Religion:] The Root of all Evil?" [[Butthurt]] theologian [[Christfag|Alister McGrath]] wrote two whole books, "Dawkins' God" and "The Dawkins Delusion," devoted to tearing him down; Dawkins is now working on "Alister McGrath: a Rapist?" and "Your Mom: a Dirty Whore?" in the tradition of [[Drama|respectful scholarly discourse]].

[[Image:Dawkinscock.jpg|thumb|"From a Darwinian perspective, sexual jealousy is easily understood." [http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/richard_dawkins/2007/11/banishing_the_greeneyed_monste.html 4th accurate quote!]]]

Dwakins and his buddy Daniel Dennett don't like the term "atheist", because "atheism is just the disgruntled noises people make in the face of religious dogmatism." They prefer to use a positive and affirming term:

{{squote|Those of us who subscribe to no religion; those of us whose view of the universe is natural rather than supernatural; those of us who rejoice in the real and scorn the false comfort of the unreal, we need a word of our own, a word like "gay".|[http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,981412,00.html 3rd accurate quote!]}}


===Fanbois===
90% of militant [[atheist]]s on the net are raving Dwakins [[fanboys]]. Clear evidence for this can be seen in his [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=richard+dawkins entry] on [[Urban Dictionary]] (lulz are in the rejected definitions). To [[troll]] them, try politely suggesting Dwakins is maybe a ''little'' too forceful in his ideological crusade - instant rants and [[butthurt]]s will follow. The other 10% hate Dwakins as much as any [[xtian]] because he is not killing enough xtians/because they want to seem cool.

===[[WTF]][[????]]===

Simply to confuse all those stupid sheeple, Richard Dwakins has recently announced he is in fact a [[Gay|Christian]].

*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7136682.stm Although he is probably only saying this because he's sick of all the drama he's caused]

The main reason for the sudden revelation is because if there aren't any Christians to [[LOL]] at, most of his [[atheist]] fanbois would stop sucking his dick.

==Future Plans==

Richard Dwakins plans to be the next [[L. Ron Hubbard]] of the atheist [[cult|movement]]. The word "belief" will be outlawed and the only things that people can think about without being emotionally abused or physically attacked are that things [[Ayn Rand]] says are the ultimate truth, and cannot be questioned. Ever. This is called [[Hypnotoad|"Free Thought."]]
[[Lie|He does not plan on being gang banged by demon niggers while burning in Hell,]] which is ironic because that's exactly what is going to happen.

===Culture===

Dwakins invented a new way of looking at culture. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|His genius could pave the way for a new understanding of social phenomena!]] Trip on this bitches: have you ever thought of different cultural trends as being sort of like viruses? Like how if someone gets excited about a movie and then everyone is sort of "infected" by the "craze?" You have? 
Oh, well there went my argument.

Anyway, Dwakins' amazing new theory is based on his idea of "just take a biological framework and slap it onto whatever the fuck you want." He calls it [[meme|memetics]]. He also invented the word [[meme]], which no one on the internet uses. [[Srsly|no srsly.]]


===Biology===
In the early 2000s, Dwakins gave up on biology to become a troll. A local legend dictates that if you give Dwakins a raw onion and/or a statue of Gary Busey, he will give you the key to a [[srsly|random Ford SUV.]]


===Musical career===
<center><youtube>eaGgpGLxLQw</youtube></center>

Richard Dwakins is including this song on his up coming album called "Straight Outta Oxford"

Other hits on the album is "Fuck Da Christians", "La (R)Evolución", "It's Called Abiogenesis, Cockfags", "There is Only One God and That's Me", "Suck My Dick Ted Haggard - [[I came|Oh, Wait"]], "Top Dawk", black person and "The Only Thing That's ID'ed is My Tweed".

The most famous part of the album is the end where he says "Constantly studying, locked up in the dorm because I have no friends, that's the way it goes in the University Of Oxford, [[Flavor Flav|boyyyyyy."]]

==[[Trolling]] Material==

After writing <b>The God Delusion</b> which sold [[over 9000|12 billion copies]], Dwakins-worship upgraded from a few pimply nerds to an entire army of [[basement-dwellers|free thinkers]]. Now he is now either [[Fellatio|adored]] or [[Rape|hated]], making him perfect [[troll]] fodder:

===[[Christians]]===
[[Image:DawkinsHaggard.jpg|left|thumb|Notorious [[Christian]] [[drug|crystal]] [[gay|queen]] [[Ted Haggard]] once offered to give Richard Dwakins [[AIDS]]. Dwakins rudely declined.]]

Dwakins only hates Christians - possibly because of the [[buttsecks|buggery]] he received as a child and is now passing on to us. He doesn't mock [[Jews]] because he's a Jew, he doesn't mock [[Islam]] because [[9/11|he lives in a very tall building]] and he doesn't mock any other religions because [[shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about them]]:


* Remind them that Dwakins calls himself a [[hypocrite|cultural Christian]].
* He only became anti-religious because a priest raped him (although, as [[TheAmazingAtheist]] will tell you, [[Rimjob|"a penis is the least harmful thing a priest could put into a child")]].
* Quote passages out of The God Delusion. 


The truth is nobody wants to think of Dawkins as being [[Scientology|religion]] - especially religious people.

===[[Atheists]]===

Trolling atheists about Dwakins is surprisingly easy because they worship him in the same manner [[Christians]] worship [[unwarranted self-importance|themselves.]] 
Remember, Dwakins needs his fanbois to suck his dick because it's [[Lie|too big for one man to suck:]]


* It's "Dwakins" not "Dawkins".
* Show them this article.
* Point out what a [[hypocrite]] he is - prove he really used to be a [[Religion|theist]].
* Tell them they can't be [[Tom Cruise|free-thinkers]] if [[Law of Conformity|they all say the exact same thing he does.]] 
[http://www.richarddawkins.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=2586 Especially this guy].

* Say you'll pray for him.
* Mention any of the accurate quotes above.
* Call him as [[Fundamentalist]] as the people he hates.
* Say he's only trying to prove he's an atheist because he's actually a [[Christian]]. Because of his insecurities over his closet Anglicanism, he now makes sure that everyone in the world knows that he is "an atheist", in the style of a 4chantard:

 I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST
 I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST

 I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST
 I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST
 I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST
 I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST I'M AN ATHEIST


Since Dwakins is a world-famous troll himself, he won't mind anything [[you]] say about him, but his fans will collectively [[shit]] themselves.

==True intentions==

Richard Dwakins has recently announced he wants to kill religion, just in case anyone thought he wasn't as much a fundamentalist as <s>[[Osama Bin Laden]]</s> [[JEWS]]. After all, <s>[[Osama]]</s> [[JEWS]] only killed 3,000 on 9/11, but there are more than 5 billion religious. <s>He says so somewhere in this video.</s> 
No, he doesn't.

[[Sarcasm|That was enlightening.]]

==Dawkins & Darwin==

Richard Dawkin's name happens to be an anagram for "Rah! Darwin's Dick!" ([http://i39.tinypic.com/ou2vcn.jpg srsly]). In case [[you]] have not noticed he has a raging [[Penis|hard-on]] for the world's most famous evolutionist and frequently uses his theory to prove that religion is wrong and science is [[Religion| truth]].

One of the most famous stories about Darwin is that he converted to [[christianity]] and renounced evolution on his deathbed - which is complete [[bullshit]], as Dwakins likes to remind everyone. [[Ironically]] however, Charles Darwin wasn't actually an [[atheist]]:

{{quote|I have never been an atheist in the in the sense of denying the existence of a God, ... I think that generally (and more and more as I grow older), but not always, that an [[agnostic]] would be the most correct description of my [[Scientology|state of mind.]]|Darwin's letter to Asa Gray.}}

==[[Religion|Reincarnation]]==
Richard Dwakins was born a [[woman]] and was originally named "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Dworkin Andrea Dworkins] ",  a thinly disguised [[brain|anagram]]. "Dworkins" achieved notoriety by claiming that "[[men]] was responsible for all [[rape]]" and that "all [[religion]] perpetrate the [[pedobear|patriarchal oppression]] of [[cunt|wimmin]]".

[[Some argue]] the real reason that Dwakins hates [[God]] is because since he was a raging [[fat]] [[ugly]] [[lesbian]] in a previous life - God decided to reincarnate him as an [[man|actual human being]]. 

Luckily for Dwakins it still looks like that thing between his legs is no larger than a [[clitoris]].
