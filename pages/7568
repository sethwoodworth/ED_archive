Slashcode
[[Image:Slash.jpeg|thumb|Not this Slash.]]
'''Slash''' (an [[acronym]] for '''S'''lashdot '''L'''ike '''A'''utomated '''S'''tory-telling '''H'''omepage) is the open source collection of [[Perl]] scripts which runs [[Slashdot]], one of the oldest and most popular collaborative [[weblog]]s around. The package is often incorrectly called '''Slashcode''', which is the name of the website and [[Open_source|SourceForge]] project. It runs [[Slashdot]] (which has spawned many imitators, called SlashClones) and is released under the terms of the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s [[GNU]]. Many other websites use various customized versions of this software for their own web forums.

Not to be confused with Slash, [[slash]], /, or [[emo]] kids cutting their wrists.
