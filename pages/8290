'''[http://www.youtube.com/user/CChanSonichuCWC CChanSonichuCWC]''' AKA [[Metal Gear Solid|Liquid Chris]] ''(and also known as "The Brown Shirted Impostor" or "Jeffrey" according to the fake [[Chris-chan]])''  is the YouTube account of the real Christian Weston Chandler that he used after CChanSonichu was banned. There is a lot of drama related to it because someone set up the account [http://www.youtube.com/user/IBAChandler IBAChandler] (later closed) to impersonate Chris and it has fooled a great many [[newfag]]s. Ian Brandon Anderson would have you believe that the TRUE and HONEST CWC is really this youtube user: [http://www.youtube.com/user/CoolStoryJon], however, these are clearly slanderous lies once again by the imposter.

The Real Chris-chan has also been having an internet romance with a "girl" called Kacey, which the impostor has been trying to steal.  Considering the past history of Chris's internet romances, it's only a matter of time before Chris figures out that Kacey is another troll and has his heart level shattered.

== The Impostor Comes ==
In July 2009 when Chris-chan's CChanSonichu account was banned by [[YouTube]], people wondered where Chrissy would go next.  His old account CChan6789 remained untouched. Then someone found [http://www.youtube.com/user/IBAChandler IBAChandler] and said it was Chris.

IBAChandler contained mostly previous Chris-chan videos and then one video called ''Rollin' and Trollin''' where someone who doesn't look at all like Chris-chan claimed to be him and said he was just a troll.


[[Image:REALChrisChanAndFriends.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Chris hangin' with his [[Chris-chan/People|homies]].]]
IBAChandler had:
* A teenager hairstyle instead of a Chris-chan hairstyle.
* A goatee instead of clean shaven.
* Sunglasses instead of large, square glasses.
* He showed some square glasses and showed them to the camera showing how they're fake glasses that don't correct his vision.
* He wore a plain t-shirt instead of the typical Chris-chan striped shirt.
* He wore a vest.
* He wore dog-collar bracelets.
* Thick prison tattoos over his forearms.
* Instead of a Sonichu medallion, he wore some blue piece of plastic.
* Instead of liking PS3 over Xbox, he prefers Xbox.

== The Impostor is found out, also known as "This reeks of self-advertising" ==

[[Image:Real cwc billy mays death note (he died in the library).jpg|thumb|The real Chris-chan holding up his Death Note and looking bloodthirsty.]]

Within a month, people discovered that IBAChandler was a fake; his real name was Ian Brandon Anderson. They learned that the real Chris-chan was using the account [http://www.youtube.com/user/CChanSonichuCWC CChanSonichuCWC].

The real Chris-chan, CChanSonichuCWC, showed up IBAChandler by things like:
* Better guitar skills
* Being able to make lots of ''Sonichu'' merchandise and sell it
* An exquisite Sonichu plush doll
* Lots more comics
* Skeptical of the [[Xbox]], which he expressed when a company offered to make a ''Sonichu'' game for him on it
* A picture of [[Billy Mays]] left over from when he killed him by [[Wicca|voodoo]]



Now exposed as a fake, IBAChandler couldn't let it go. He locked comments on his videos, banned people who outed him as a fake, and went around making videos denouncing the real Chris-chan, CChanSonichuCWC. He even tried to hide his fakery by buying a Sonichu medallion from the real Chris-chan.

IBAChandler even started copying the real Chris-chan in another way. Seeing how CChanSonichuCWC has always set lots of YouTube users as his friend, at the end of July 2009, IBAChandler then started copying that, too. Will IBAChandler not just give up the ruse?

Fortunately, there's still tons of [[newfag]]s who are still fooled into thinking that IBAChandler is the real Chris-chan.

CChanSonichuCWC himself has said that he thinks IBAChandler is probably ''that slanderous troll, Clyde Cash.''

[[Image:Evil alternate spock.jpg|190px|thumb|right|Now we will no longer be able to tell which Chris is the evil Impostor]]

On July 31st the the fake troll IBA chandler has issued a challenge to the TRUE and HONEST CWC.

== Jimmy Hill knows better ==

[[Chris-chan/People#Jimmy_Hill|Jimmy Hill]], if you didn't know, owns the copyright and trademark on Sonichu in Europe and Asia, but not in the Americas. This was all fine when he was younger, but Jimmy Hill is now over 80 years old and had to retire. So he passed his rights onto the person who owns them in America, Christian Weston Chandler.

[[Image:Real chrischan drivers license.jpg|frame|none|Jimmy Hill used lawyers to determine who was the real Chris-chan and they even had confirmation based on driver's license.]]

July 2009, Hill announced on his [http://sonichu.110mb.com/ website]:
<div style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 18px; margin-top:40px; text-align:left;background-color:#ffffec; border:1pt solid #999999;padding:10px">
<big>
<center>*** Jimmy Hill has retired. ***</center></big><br/>

He has made so much money now that it's time to pass on the flame. From now on the one TRUE creator and distributor of Sonichu merchandise can be found here:
<br/><br/>
 <center>http://www.youtube.com/user/CChanSonichuCWC</center>
<br/><br/>
<center>All other Sonichu Merchandise is FAKE.
<br/><br/></center>

Thanks to the millions of ''Sonichu'' fans around the world for all of their support!

== The Singstar Challenge: CChanSonichuCWC vs. IBAChandler ==

[[Image:CWCvsIanGuitar.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Guitar Heroes.]]

The fake CWC, aka IBAChandler, aka Ian Brandon Anderson, initiated a challenge to the true, honest CWC:

<center>{{frame|<youtube>M9MF5XKiDvw</youtube>|color=#3C3C3C}}</center>

Not one to let his fans down, our beloved true, honest Chris-chan took up the challenge straight away. He has so far blown Ian Brandon Anderson out of the water with every performance, and will finally be able to lay this damn dirty troll to rest once and for all.

In the latest response, the real CWC challenges the impostor to sing "SMELL YO DICK" by Riskay without altering any lyrics. This might prove impossible by Ian Brandon Anderson.

== The actual truth behind all this ==

[[Image:Fat crhis is sammy in comics.png|frame|right|Sammy as an exact replica of Ian.]]

Although Chris and Ian claim not to have known each other previously, it turns out that they did. Long before Chris's internet fame, he created a ''Ghostbusters'' "skitch" in ''Sonichu'' #7. In it, he made a character Sammy, who was modeled after none other than Ian Brandon Anderson.

[[Image:Sammyandchrisfromcomics.png|400px|thumb|none|Ian as Sammy in the comics.]]

This makes sense how Ian has been able to know all these personal details about Chris and has even been able to get Chris's yearbooks. They've known each other since high school.

[[Image:Thin chris is the true chris in comics.png|400px|thumb|none|As you can see here, the true Chris-chan is completely skinny with no large gut or manboobs, just like how the real Chris is skinny in the comics.]]

==OH NOES!!!==
Following the ruling of the judges in the SingStar competition, Chris was declared the winner. He posted this video in response:

<center>{{frame|<youtube>B6Q1yFXgdoQ</youtube>|color=#3C3C3C}}</center>

In it, Chris thanks his girlfriend for accepting his marriage proposal (incidentally, he proposed), and states that he'll be moving to Redmond to work on the ''Sonichu'' game in conjunction with Microsoft and Nintendo.

Ian, being the slanderous troll that he is, responded with this video:

<center>{{frame|<youtube>MqNhOEBVxtk</youtube>|color=#3C3C3C}}</center>

In this, Ian goes completely batshit, having now ''convinced himself that he is actually Chris.'' [[Some argue|If I'm not mistaken]], he even tells you to go to his ED page to see the truth. Of course, everyone knows that he is actually an impostor.

Then, to everyone's shock, this video was posted on the real Chris's YouTube page:

<center>{{frame|<youtube>RdshGz_Pvks</youtube>|color=#3C3C3C}}</center>


That's right, dear readers: '''IAN B. ANDERSON HAS KIDNAPPED OUR BELOVED CHRIS.'''

Our hopes and prayers go to Chris in this dark time, and may Ian rot in the fires of Hell for all eternity.

While some misguided fools might think the video is fake, the real Chris's fiance posted this video:

<center>{{frame|<youtube>K9kIcTdeqYU</youtube>|color=#3C3C3C}}</center>


In the video, she states that Chris really has [[Permabanned|gone missing]], proving that the 'GONE' video is true.
May the emperor [[Troll|protect]] our dear Chris's soul at this dark time. 

It is our sad duty to report that the real Christian Weston Chandler has been [[Banned IRL|murdered]] by Ian. May he be at peace and play the [[Shit|''Sonichu'']] video game in [[Jesus|Heaven]]. And may Ian burn in the fiery pits of [[Satan|Hell]].

No body was ever found. His corpse is presumed to have been [[OM NOM NOM NOM|eaten]].

To further steal The Real Chris-chan's identity, the impostor closed IBAChandler and created a new account, [http://www.youtube.com/user/ChristianWChandler ChristianWChandler] where he reuploaded many of his videos.

==REBORN==
On October 15, Chris had returned to the real world unscathed, minus the bleeding asshole when he found himself stranded in the Sahara Desert. Further proof that not only is Ian a huge douchebag, but a flaming faggot to boot.

==Current Theories NOW DISPROVED==
[[Image:Wedding Photo by Scarlet Rose.jpg|thumb|right||Married.]]
The real CWC :
* Is just being a [[attention whore|drama queen]] and has gone into "hiding".
* Got [[Fandom|someone]] not involved to film himself being treated like the [[fail|fail]] [[an hero|Batman]] from the [[Why So Serious?|''Dark Knight'']].
* Is a lot [[lolwut|smarter]] than we are giving him [[lolwut|credit]] for...

The fake CWC :
* Seriously fucking captured him and is holding him [[rape|hostage]] in a room lined with brown paper bags!
* Got someone [[fag|else]] to capture him.
* [[fact|Has no life.]]
* [[fact|Also has no girlfriend.]]


Or :
* It is a ploy by CWC, the fake, and the [[bitch|girlfriend/fiancee]] to produce [[lulz]] and confuse the fuck out of [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|newfags]].
* [[no one cares|no one cares]]
* Some [[Nice Guys|guy]] [[rape|captured]] the real CWC.
* Some [[Psychopath|guy]] [[Banned|captured]] the real CWC.
* Some [[Asperger's syndrome|guy]] [[Internet stalking|found]] and [[rape|captured]] the real CWC.
* Nintendo decided to just [[murder|get rid of]] the real CWC before they get any more ''Sonichu'' petitions.
* It is all staged so his [[shit|artwork]] will appreciate in value.


In light of [[Easter|Chris's return]], we can only assume he (Honest and true Chris) is speaking the [[truth]] ( with great honesty) in regards to his capture, [[rape]] and subsequent escape from Ian.

It is reported that the real CWC is now [[lolwut|married]] to his [[bitch|beloved]] while [[faggot|Ian]] is still posting masses of stupid [[shit|videos]]. While the details are obviously a little fucked up as to what exactly happened to CWC (drugs sounds like a winner), and why he didn't file a police report for being [[rape|violated]] by [[faggot|Ian]]... these are questions that may never be answered (and perhaps better left that way). On another note he supposedly got the patent for Sonichu! Good job CWC =) thanks for the [[gay|brilliant]] [[lulz|performance]]! Best of luck with the [[lulz|franchise]] and HIT [[vagina|THAT]] GOOD!
