Iain Hall/Deviant Behaviour
==Deviant behaviour==

[[Image:Talkstalk1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A message from the Australian Federal Government]]

Iain Hall first came to prominence (anonymously, of course) for [[lulz|despicably]] stalking prominent left-wing blogger Jeremy Sear[http://www.anonymouslefty.blogspot.com/] (then known anonymously as "MrLefty"). Hall's blog ''Boltwatch-Watch'' started as a counter point to Sear's own BoltWatch [http://boltwatch.blogspot.com]. Unable to actually articulate ''why'' Sear annoyed him so much, or hold his own in an argument, the blog quickly degenerated into personal attacks. Nobody is quite sure why Iain was so dangerously obsessed by Sear, although nothing can justify his decisions to publish Sear's picture, address and phone number. Certainly nothing can excuse Hall's attempt to have him fired. Jealousy at Sear's youth, income and career were probably Hall's motives. Iain also had the habit of flooding the comments of sites negative towards Sear. You have to remember that Iain doesn't believe any of this constitutes trolling.

Hello Jeremy,

"My name is Walter Jeremy Sear and I am a Bloggaholic , it has been four hours and fourty munites since my last blog........"
Did you like the "fisk" treatment5 I gave your last boltwatch post ? |Iain Hall|starting to get quite creepy [http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/49530/20060510-0000/www.spinstartshere.com/index9a84.html?q=node/1217#comment-33081]}}

Hall, obsessively stalking someone over the Internet for several months is... well... incredibly sad. How many blogs have you spammed trying to attack me now? I see you were on here yesterday begging "Hack" to write a post attacking me. Have you noticed that everyone, including those who don't like me (which, admittedly, is quite a few on TSSH), almost unanimously recognise that you're a complete tool? Have you considered getting a fucking life?

Iain also [[troll|trolled]] mercilessly, viciously and without reason at Tim Blair's blog[http://timblair.net/ee/index.php/weblog/comments/identified_lefty/]. Even there he was [[Dying_alone|unable to find many friends]], and he was questioned on his hypocrisy:

{{quote|Iain, you only post under your real name now because you were outed. Didn’t you post under the name Being Nice and pretend to be a woman?|Skeptic|exposing Iain[http://timblair.net/ee/index.php/weblog/comments/identified_lefty/#103745]}}

{{quote|Iain I know for a fact that you are a sad, vindictive obsessed little man.  You have been following Lefty around for months.  Why do you care so much - the purpose of Boltwatch is to debate Bolt’s opinions - and if you were concerned at the views Lefty was espousing it would be fair to have a crack at them, but you don’t even bother. I know it has been said before but you really need to GET A LIFE - and leave the other nasty people on this blog to get back to their true purpose.|Jacki|conforming to the phenotype[http://timblair.net/ee/index.php/weblog/comments/identified_lefty/#103890]}}

{{quote|It is not just his dignity that is hanging in the breeze I bet his fellows in chambers will be having a great laugh at his expense and it won’t be because of his political opinions but because of a silly reaction to his public exposure.|Iain Hall|proving once and for all he intended on harming Sear's career[http://timblair.net/ee/index.php/weblog/comments/identified_lefty/#104755]}}

Hall has also tried unsuccessfully to recruit a minor to locate personal information on another blogger named Bruce[http://thinkerspodium.wordpress.com/2007/10/02/those-things-that-us-bloggers-put-up-with/], by trying to get a minor to stalk him. He even went as far as asking her to take pictures of Bruce for his website. Another Hall attempt to locate personal details, this time about 'Bridget Gread', went horribly wrong after he believed his victim to be a Melbourne TV journalist. Hall e-mailed several news outlets and wrote a lengthy attack on this individual, only to withdraw it after 24 hours due to defamation fears.[http://respectahall.blogspot.com/2007/11/january-2006-iain-been-caught-stalkin.html]

Iain Hall regularly floods the comments sections on blogs that criticize him. He has managed to close down at least one blog using this technique. He has also attempted and failed to erase this article using the identity 'thelordgod'[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/User:Thelordgod]. Apparently not learning the first time he tried completely re-write it using the identity 'Mars Rover' [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/User:Mars_rover], but his efforts were reverted within minutes. 

On the 30th November 2007, Dead Roo[http://www.deadroo.com/] will cease operation. One of the reasons is Iain Hall[http://www.deadroo.com/#comment-4311]:

{{quote|"...none of us enjoyed having to deal with the likes of Iain Hall, trolls of any description suck the fun out of writing.|Authors of Dead Roo|talking about closing their blog.}}

Iain responded with his unique brand of insightfulness:

{{quote|"Anyone who cares to look before this page disappears will see that any post to which I contributed comments at the very least made the readers here actually have to explore the bassis for their position on any a particular issue."|Iain Hall|....what???}}

Just for good measure, here is another example of Iain in action stalking and making more threats to bloggers[http://lacomplaintedupartisan.blogspot.com/2007/10/much-ado-about-nuffers.html]:
{{quote|
"You will be pursued wherever you go using this blogging identity
and when your real identity is discovered, as it will be, you will be named and
shamed.|Iain Hall| a typical email}}

==The "Black Wednesday" Saga==

On the 29th of August, someone who seemed to be one of Iain's most loyal supporters, Fang, turned against him [http://iainfukall.wordpress.com/], admitting that he only felt sorry for him. Iain immediately deleted many of the comments from his blog.

{{quote|"I gave you the benefit of the doubt for a long while because I felt sorry for you and stuck up for you even when it made me look like an idiot. However, you can’t even use a spell check. Get a job, and stop using my money to fund your noddy car." |Fang|turning on Iain.}}
 
In response to Fang telling Iain how it is, Iain accused Fang of threatening him with physical violence. The violence being euphemistically and jokingly referred to as "ocular penetration" by Fang if Iain tried to stalk him. However, due to ''The Onion's Skull Fucking Bill of 2007'' [http://www.theonion.com/content/video/live_from_congress_the_skull], this rendered Fang's joke redundant. On Friday 5th October 2007 Iain again complained of "explicit threats of violence" from Fang. [http://www.grods.com/post/1466/#comment-7746]

However, Iain has repeatedly emailed Fang in an attempt to bait him. On October 2nd (3 days before Iain complained of "explicit threats of violence") Iain emailed Fang:

{{quote|"Seeing your latest, and rather pathetic efforts, I suggest that these links may help you with your obvious,and admitted,  abuse problems."|Iain Hall|2/10/07.}}

Iain then provided links to dubious pornography and alcohol rehabilitation centres. Fang told Iain not to bother emailing him again. [http://www.grods.com/post/1466/#comment-7773]However in true Iain Hall style, he once again emailed Fang on the 19th October 2007 with nonsensical rambling accusing him of numerous crazy and unsubstantiated allegations. God only knows what Iain is taking about:

{{quote|"Fang I'm willing to bet that you still live with your mummy and dream about having a life of your own because clearly you don't have at present. As I have said before Fang the fact that you pay for the domain name and the hosting for that site says heaps about just how sad and sorry your life is. What is it now about ten or twelve hates sites devoted to me that you have created? Your updated page is still a yawn though and you obviously up until very late writing all of that crap What you fail to is that the people who do read that page do come and check on my actual blogs they are very often pleasantly surprised to find that I am not as you try to paint me at all and then they just think that the you are a sad sorry wanker obsessed with me. Oh and I don't need to look for a job I actually have one and I enjoy it very much because it is very satisfying and rewarding. But you just don’t get the idea that when you don’t have to pay rent (because you own your home out right, and anther one as well) then you don’t have to work every hour that God gives us to just keep your place on the consumer treadmill. As I said, you need to get a life because your obsession with me is no substitute. I suggest that you might begin by trying to do some thing of social virtue like picking up litter or helping a charity and after a while you may learn the value of humility and altruistic service. Some thing you are entirely lacking at present. Cheers Comrade Iain"|Iain Hall|the greatest email he's ever sent19/10/07.}}

The email will be used by MIT as a blue print for studies of delusional-moronic-stay-at-home-unemployed-stalking-bloggers. Even Professor Noam Chomksy can't explain the linguistics behind this email as it totally blows his theory of generative grammar out of the water. 

However, Chomsky's  branch of cognitive psychology; genuine insights in linguistics imply concomitant understandings of aspects of mental processing and sub-human nature may help explain Iain's regressive behavior and writing style. Further, unlike Nim Chimpsky [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim_Chimpsky], Iain Hall may provide the missing link between animal language acquisition to that of sub-humans.

In Iain's latest unsolicited email to Fang on 22nd October 2007, Iain made thinly veiled depraved threats and typical false accusations regarding harassment, even going as far to liken Fang to a pedophile:

{{quote|"Finally you have been posting consistently from the same IP address so don’t delude yourself that you are untraceable and that you can hide forever should you continue to harass me.  Take heed from the recent story of that paedophile that delighted in posting pictures of his crimes with his face distorted in a swirl. That scumbag is now in a Thai jail cell, likewise you could end up in a whole world of trouble should you continue as you have been of late."|Iain Hall|22/10/07.}}

In the same email Iain incriminated himself admitting he stalked or as he describes it "fights" with Jeremy, Bruce, Mikey and others. In other words he harasses, stalks and threatens all in sundry. He claims to have "done a penance for (his) sins" but has never once apologised for stalking, harassing or trying to get them sacked.

{{quote|"The fights that I have had with others (Jeremy, Bruce Mikey et al) are for all intents and purposes over. I have done a penance for my sins and I have moved on to other interests and other topics to blog about."|Iain Hall|22/10/07.}}

According to an undisclosed source, Fang has not responded to any of Iain's emails. While Iain Hall claims he is the victim, he is in fact, the perpetrator of stalking and threatening behavior. His sending of links to dubious pornography, alcohol rehabilitation centres and his threatening email alluding to a recent story involving an alleged pedophile and rapist[http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/I/INTERPOL_MANHUNT?SITE=WIRE&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT], speaks volumes about Iain, his motives and his sick, disturbing mindset.

*The emails were provided to the author by Fang as a duty to the safety of the internet community and society as a whole. The world salutes your honorable and noble actions in bringing these emails to light Fang. Make sure you check the next Queen's Birthday Honours List and nominations for Australian of the Year.

==Lawsuits==

When lost for an argument that doesn't involve the hardcore claim that one is a "minion of the left", Iain Hall likes to threaten meaningless [[Legal_action|lawsuits]], once even emailing blogger John Surname with the rather startling admission that he wouldn't be using a lawyer, as he would rather ''[[In_the_ass|service John himself]]''. (Please see [[Iain_Hall/Email_Transcripts|email transcripts of Iain Hall]].) Recently, Iain has been involved in an internet war with freedom fighter Bourbon Boy, and has resorted back to his usual method of threatening legal action[http://iainhall.wordpress.com/2007/09/28/the-smell-of-burning-troll-in-the-morning/#more-1097]. Why? Because he claims Bourbon Boy is stalking him, a claim that delighted all as it wasn't long ago Iain was engaged in his infamous campaign against then-anonymous-blogger Jeremy Sear simply because he disagreed with his political viewpoints. 

{{quote|"I may loathe the politics of, Sear, Everett, Bridge and Greed, but at least they are worthy of some measure of respect because they do have a political opinion and argue from honestly held beliefs . But what do you have? What do you believe in apart from a persistent and petulant desire to harass me? Nothing, nowt, nada as far as anyone can see. But bullies are nearly always actually very sad empty individuals who mask their social inadequacies through their brutish behaviors  and you clearly conform to the phenotype 110%."|Iain Hall|not conforming to the phenotype.}}

==Literacy==

{{quote|"My grasp of the English language is probably better than most people."[http://trolltalesandtrue.wordpress.com/encyclopedia-dramatica-part-one]|Iain Hall|Meaning to say "... most people''''s'''"}}

Iain Hall's grasp of the English language is tenuous and he is slowly learning that [[Microsoft]] Word's spell check function will neither correct grammar nor turn long strings of random words into functioning clauses. Consequently, his arguments rarely make any sense.

One example:

{{quote|"To be analogous and equally funny Bolts book would have to be placed in say the Marxism or Nazi section putting it in the “humour” section is by no stretch of the imagination in the same league as the placement of Flannery’s book in mythology/religion section. There is no relationship to a previous classification claim that is hotly denied by Bolt or his supporters, only those who are into cheap name calling and shallow derision would think that by simply claiming that Bolt’s work should be seen as a joke would think that suggesting it is by placing in under that category actually makes it so."[http://iainhall.wordpress.com/2007/03/12/where-it-belongs/]
|Iain Hall|....what???}}
Iain has refused to take direct responsibility for the above quote, instead skirting around the issue and blaming it on the ignorance of [[Last Thursday|youth]]. He claims to have seen "far worse than this..." and says he has improved[http://trolltalesandtrue.wordpress.com/encyclopedia-dramatica-part-one/]. He hasn't[http://trolltalesandtrue.wordpress.com/encyclopedia-dramatica-part-one/].

*Iain Hall's frequent spelling tragedies are the thing of blogospheric myth, and people have been known to count the number of Iain Hall spelling errors in a given day to see if he can exceed that number in the next.

*Classic examples have included "furfilled"[http://ilovebourbon.blogspot.com/2006/12/iain-spotting-iain-blogging-celebrity.html], "looser"[http://ilovebourbon.blogspot.com/2006_12_01_archive.html][http://www.grods.com/post/1560/#comment-8237], "loosing"[http://www.grods.com/post/1617/#comment-8876] and memorably "bloggosphere"[http://iainhall.wordpress.com/2007/11/08/when-the-credit-card-is-lord/][http://iainhall.wordpress.com/2007/09/20/boltwatch-watch-revisited/] - a word he wrongly claimed had no set spelling.

*While he has always over-used commas, he has recently taken to using semi-colons in a haphazard fashion, merely dotting them in random fashion over a page with no thought to where they actually belong.[http://iainhall.wordpress.com/2007/08/10/there-is-a-storm-brewing-in-the-sunshine-state/] [http://iainhall.wordpress.com/2007/11/27/is-the-economic-migrant-floodgate-about-to-open/] [https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=13834910&postID=117512765313171575] This has given him the nickname "Iain; Hall".

*Fittingly, Iain's favourite word is "pernicious". "Iain; Hall’s Pernicious-o-meter"[http://www.grods.com/post/1466/#comment-7821]has clocked his use of this word at [[over 9000|over 9000 times]] and counting [http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=pernicious+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fiainhall.wordpress.com%2F&btnG=Google+Search&meta= ] [http://iainhall.wordpress.com/2007/11/25/a-most-terrible-example-of-misandry/] [http://iainhall.wordpress.com/2007/11/27/is-the-economic-migrant-floodgate-about-to-open/#comment-25560], thereby demonstrating his inherent lack of perspicacious judgment.

*Iain Hall also regularly corrects his own spelling errors if and when they are pointed out by his critics at Hallwatch and Grodscorp, proving that he regularly reads these blogs. 

*He has also had the title "orthographic abstract artist" [http://www.grods.com/post/1666/#comment-9253] bestowed upon him.

==Similarity to Bolt==

Despite his claims all his views are his own, Hall's views always magically align with Andrew Bolt's.[http://iainhall.wordpress.com/2007/08/24/good-one-andrew/] [[Some_argue|Some have suggested]] that they are lost-twins or have ESP powers that enable them to share opinions, though others think that Hall simply reads Bolt because he is unable to think for himself. Exceedingly often, especially in relation to global warming, he is only able to parrot Bolt's buzzwords while contributing nothing new to the overall argument[http://www.deadroo.com/index.php/shocking-news-andrew-bolt-spreads-another-hoax/].


{{quote|"At the risk of being accused of echoing Andrew I commend his latest column as a great exploration of Green hypocrisy with regard to “climate change”.[http://iainhall.wordpress.com/2007/11/09/exactly-right-andrew/]|Iain Hall|thinking for himself after cutting and pasting all of Bolt's column.}}

==Identity Theft & Deceitfulness==

... cont ...It must also be noted that the file names of many of the pictures contain the word "womyn", a word never used by Bridgit, but instead frequently employed by bi-sexual, feminist and blogger Miss Politics[http://misspoliticsaustralia.blogspot.com], on whose site Iain has trolled in the past[http://misspoliticsaustralia.blogspot.com/2007/03/anonymous-lefty-absolute-genius.html].

On the 1st of December more proof that the blog was authored by Iain Hall was dug up[http://www.grods.com/post/1685/]. 

Iain also claims that the blog couldn't possibly be his because it contains posts all the way from back in January 2005, whereas Iain didn't start blogging until late 2005. Yes, he's serious when he claims this, and yes, he is lying through his teeth because he is well aware of how to backdate blog posts[http://iainhall.wordpress.com/2005/04/].
