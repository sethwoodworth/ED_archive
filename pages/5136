<p>ED is not a site that mainstream advertisers like google and yahoo want to advertise on. In fact, we are barred from doing business with google adsense completely. In order to keep ED content open, free and uncensored, we accept donations. 100% of the money you give goes toward keeping the site up and running and paying costs like hosting fees, domain registrations and bandwidth charges. If you’re unable to donate, harass your friends to donate for you. Donations are accepted with credit card payments through Visa, Mastercard and American Express. All payments are guaranteed safe. The transaction is encrypted and your information is never, ever shared with anyone. Donate today to keep ED safe and legal!</p>
