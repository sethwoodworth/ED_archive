'''NiGHTS into Dreams''' is known as one of the most retarded, nonsensical, overrated piece of shit games ever mostly by the 13 year olds who must now fap to something other than Sonic, even though the game is made by the same company. The whole game takes place in a dream world so nothing that happens actually fucking matters.

==Game in a Nutshell==

NiGHTS is TEH FUKANG WOERST [[video game|VIDYA GAEM]] EVAR created by [[lie|TEH GREETAST VIDYA GAEM COMPANAY EVAR]] about two [[incestual]] [[lolicon|children]] who after receiving serious amounts of [[butthurt]] one day, decide to [[party hard]] that night, having premarital sex and taking large quantities of [[acid]], and are induced to create an [[imaginary]] world filled with all of the [[fanfiction|wet dreams]] of every [[sick fuck]] currently asleep. Unfortunately, the evil black person ''[[lolwut|Wizeman the Wicked]]'' is stealing everyone's [[bike|dreams]], raising his [[over 9000|power level]] until eventually he can quit [[IRC]] and [[pwn]] the world [[IRL]]. The [[12-year-old boy]] and his [[13-year-old girl|13-year-old sister]] aren't going to put up with that [[crap]] in their trip. 

So naturally they don't do [[shit|jack shit]] while a [[pedophile|purple spandex wearing]] [[castration|genderless]] [[fairy]], named ''NiGHTS'' by the [[spellcheck|Microsoft-Word]]-impaired [[Sega]], helps them defeat this nigger by [[rape|joining their bodies and becoming one]]. In other words, NiGHTS does all the work while the children [[worthless|sit back and do nothing]]. NiGHTS flies around fighting off all the enemies and eventually defeats the main villain. After that, the children recover from their acid trip, waking up from their comatose state on top of [[wat|Big Ben]] and realize that it was all a dream. [[Peter Pan|Sounds familiar?]]

==Gameplay==
Use the analog stick to make NiGHTS fly in circles to collect stuff. [[gay|That's it]]. And on top of that [[fail]], the controls are [[shit]].

Or, if you're a fancy advanced technological person, you can use your Wii remote and point it on the screen to do the same thing.Of course, nobody uses that because everybody [[IGN|IGN said so]].

==Wii Version: NiGHTS Journey of Dreams==
[[Image:Nights_3.jpg|thumb|The [[storyboard]] for the new NiGHTS]]. 
[[Copypasta]] of the first game onto a [[Wii]] disc, with the [[obvious|subtle]] addition of the word ''journey,'' [[sarcasm|making the game much better!]]

===Differences===

There are actually [[lie|quite a few differences]] between the original and the remake. NiGHTS into Dreams featured two children named Elliot [[Twilight|Edwards]] and Claris Sinclair. They are both failures.

{{quote|One day, Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair, two children from the city of Twin Seeds, go through failures.|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nights_into_Dreams... TOW]}}

Elliot wants to be a basketball player, but was brutally raped by kids from another grade and goes home in shame. Claris wants to sing in a play, but when she sings everyone dies so she sprints home sobbing. At night they relive their days events in nightmares and masturbate furiously. They then escape to Nightopia and find that they both have the rare [[virginity|Red Ideya of Courage]]. They release Nights, who tells them to fuck and then have him fly around in their ecstasy dreams. They eventually defeat some evil dude and go home.

NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams had two kids named William Taylor and Helen Cartwright. They used to be close to their parents, but stopped their nightly incest sessions for other stuff. William wants to be a soccer player, but his dad moves to a new job and won't show his son how to play with balls. Helen stops practicing her violin with her mother to go smoke pot with her new friends. They have nightmares later that night and get chased by [[Pedobear]] into Nightopia. Then it's the same as the prior game with minor changes. NiGHTS and it's [[incest|boyfriend and brother]] also got a change in clothing: Reala wears a [[gay]] face mask called a [[faggot|Persona]] with frilly feathers on it, practically wears a [[weeaboo|samurai suit]] and has [[gay|pink nails]]. NiGHTS just got its vest revamped. Lame, amirite?

==[[Astrima]] and her fanbase==
{{main|Astrima}}
Loving this game so much, [[Astrima]] created a website devoted to the game and their fantards.

Like any other shitty overrated game, NiGHTS has a fanbase that could potentially be as batshit insane as that of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] fanbase. The correct terminology used for people who obsess over this game would be NiGHTSfag. A NiGHTSfag's natural habitat is on the dreaded fansite known only as [http://NiGHTSintodreams.com|NiGHTSintodreams.com], a place where thousands of NiGHTSfags roam free talking about how much their precious game is the [[lie|greatest thing ever created]], create [[Shit|fan art, fanfiction, and other stupid shit,]] and whine and bitch about how their almighty god NiGHTS is getting left in the dust because [[No|Sonic is much better in every way.]]

The fanbase as a main is full of bitchy [[Weeaboos|teenaboos]] that are easy as hell to troll. All you really have to do (for [[Loser|LucidDreamer]]) is double post, or commit anything people find annoying in a [[Forum]], or remind them of how their campaign was trolled heavily. They'll shit brix.

==The Don't Forget NiGHTS Campaign==

[[Image:Digipostcampaign.jpg|thumb|DiGi's reaction to the result]]
The fucktards at NiGHTSintoDreams.com have decided that, because they are so butthurt over the fact that [[shit nobody cares about|their idol has been pushed aside for too long]], the ringleader of the NiGHTSfags, as well as a closet [[Furfag]], known as DiGi Valentine has decided to create a campaign that will [[Unrealistic Expectations| get NiGHTS into the latest Sega clusterfuck of a Mario Kart ripoff known only as Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing.]] 


DiGi is making all of Sega and the NiGHTS community aware of this by making a bet to himself. Because he's so damn sure that if NiGHTS is not part of the final roster of the game, he will [[idiot|burn his entire collection of NiGHTS shit.]] There's a fine line between being passionate about something and being overly fucking obsessive with it, and by the looks of it, this line might have been crossed. Ever since this dramatic announcement, NiGHTSfags have been going batshit insane about if their god NiGHTS will be disregarded or not, and they will stop at nothing to annoy the fuck out of Sega to get him into the game in [[shitting dick nipples|any way, shape, or form.]] Even after all the faggotry, NiGHTS got into All-Stars Racing, [[Trolled|only to become the flag man]].
<br>'''THIS JUST IN:'''
DiGi quit the bet and he decided [[lolwut|NOT TO BURN HIS NiGHTS SHIT AT ALL!]] Of course, it's to be expected.
