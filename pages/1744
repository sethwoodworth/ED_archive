[[File:Corruption.jpg|thumb|The real feeling conspiracy theorists have towards corruption]]
There is a secret cabal whose only design is to keep you from getting laid.  There are forces aligning against your attempts to make money.  Secret societies are lining up and scheming just so that you will never be successful.  Mysterious factions gather under the full moon, attempting to bring the downfall of the world, just so that you will never lose weight, be attractive, or stop smelling like cheese.  All of these things, these '''Conspiracy Theories''', are the average internet slob’s excuse as to why he or she has become and remains such a goddamned loser.
All conspiracy theories revolve around two things, [[fail]] and [[jew gold|money]]. If you can find any subject which involves ''some'' type of fail in which ''someone'' made money there is a conspiracy.
In basement terms
 CONSPIRACY= FAIL AND MONEY;
 IF 
 (MONEY > MONEY BEFORE FAIL) 
 THEN 
 (CONSPIRACY= TRUE);
 ELSE 
 (FAIL <= 0); 
 THEN 
 (CONSPIRACY=FALSE);
 END IF

You're in hiding

And you hold your meetings

We can hear you coming

We know what you're after

We're wise to you this time

For most people, life is a series of steady ups and downs that do not shake the bedrock of quality living.  These people, well adjusted and sane, are often skeptics of conspiracy theories, and thus will not be discussed within the confines of this article. 
 
A raving minority of people, often called the lunatic fringe and just as often quite vocal, are the main believers of conspiracy and the various hypothesis that often accompany the most outlandish of these theories.  Like all minorities, they are annoying and shrill.  Because it is a well known fact that news agencies and other media outlets will often pick up on the most outlandish of stories, these groups are quite inventive, obnoxious, and loud.  

==Obsessive/Compulsive==
Conspiracy theorists are often categorized as people who have obsessive/compulsive disorder.  Individuals will have an eccentric set of actions that preclude their comfort level and ability to be effective depending on the situation.  Some examples of these eccentric behaviors include:

*collecting large numbers of firearms

*distracted attention

*constant mumbling

*talking and answering oneself

*continual mumbling

*you need to shut up

*preoccupation with a fetish 

*don’t speak to me like that

*fixation on events or sets of events

While obsessive/compulsive disorder is far and away the largest noticeable symptom within the conspiracy theorist community, it is by no means the least dangerous or distracting.  Paranoia is probably the largest single factor in determining whether an individual is your average, run-of-the-mill tabloid reading fatty or if they are a real, dyed-in-the-wool psycho who has a fallout shelter in their back yard which they lovingly call either “the compound” or “the situation room.”

==Paranoia==
An individual has to really be fucked in the head to actually believe that a “shadow government” stands behind the scenes, pulling the puppet strings, and defining how life on earth is maintained.  None-the-less, there is a large population, often referred to as “Illuminati theorists” who believe that the folks of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones Skull and Bones], the [[Bilderberg Group]], the Trilateral Commission, the Sacred Chao, and the jews all seem to run everything.  When you consider how these people think, it is perfectly acceptable to believe that everything ties into a centralized government that is designed to control you and allow you no freedoms other than the ones they prescribe.  When you consider a more sane line of thinking, you pretty much know that you are in your position in life because of choices and mistakes you have made.  Seriously, the world needs ditch diggers…and you couldn’t get past organic chemistry in college.  Hear that buzzer?  Quick, it’s time to drop fries!

==Famous Conspiracy Theories==
<video type="youtube" id="l9BEFfErJpU" width="200" height="200" desc="[[Princess Diana]], killed by the [[French]]???" frame="true" position="right"/>
Since the mid 1990’s, there has been a major growth in the tabloid culture of conspiracy theorists, their ideas, and the mass production of all forms of media that report this kind of garbage.  Some of the more famous internet theories:


===[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]===
Conspiracy theory goes mainstream.  An anonymous Russian synthesized everything available about Jews, [[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy|Freemasons]], communists, and the Antichrist and wrote the classic of the genre.  Instead of a dragon, the Antichrist is a Jewish salesman who will cause as many disasters as possible before rescuing the world.  This means that anything bad that happens to anyone, anywhere, is caused by the Jews.  All rule-the-world conspiracy theories, from aliens to the mortgage crisis are ripoffs of this.  


===9/11 was and Inside Job===
Some conspiracy theorists believe that [[George Bush]] was the real [[LOL_WUT|mastermind]] behind 9/11 and that he did it to justify the [[Rape|invasion]] of [[Iraq]].  All of these same people believe George Bush to be an idiot incapable of wiping his own ass, so how they think George Bush is still smart enough to organize the most destructive single act of terrorism in the history of the world and get away with it, who the fuck knows.

===Jews did 9/11===
[[Image:Conspiracy Theory - 4.png|thumb|Jews are a lower form of life with limited intelligence and are akin to animals, so how could they control everything?]]
[[Image:Conspiracy Theory - 1.gif|thumb|Pot smoking jungle savages have been alarming people for centuries.  I think I see Pikachu in there.]]
[[Image:Conspiracy Theory - 2.jpg|thumb|There were furries even back in the 1970's]]
[[Image:Conspiracy Theory - 8.jpg|thumb|The Hollow Earth Theory.  Sorry folks, the only thing going on here is a bunch of arabs getting rich and buying up hotels in Nevada.]]
A natural evolution from the lolracism that is prevalent on such popular websites as 4chan and other notable web message boards.  Once the neo-Nazis and white supremacists got a hold of this theory, it really began to become mainstream.  On a related note, it is common knowledge that airplane fuel does not burn hot enough to melt steel, however it does burn  hot enough to heat steel to the point where it will bend.  So shut the fuck up Rosie O’Donnel.

This conspiracy theory is rare in that it's actually been proven [[Truth|true]].


===The World will end in [[2012]]===
Its so [[obvious]]! So a group of savages who wipe their asses with their hands, thought it was necessary to sacrifice thousands of people a year to prevent some god from destroying their harvest and were constantly stoned on Jimson weed can make a calendar that repeats.  It just happens to be the 13th time the thing has repeated itself, so let's all panic like fucking retarded 2nd graders!  Really though, it just goes back to day one when it ends like a regular calendar.  Fucking dumb asses will [[wikipedia|believe anything]].

===Fiction is True===
The belief that mass media such as “Minority Report”, “1984”, “Fahrenheit 451”, ”[[The Matrix|V for Vendetta]]”, ”The DaVinci Code”, ”The X-Files”, ”Tabloid Elvis sightings”, and the "Terminator" series are all true.  Further discussion, often heated and full of rage, will only make these fiction stories more true.  The main proponents of these theories are keyboard jockey nerds who have no life and spend way too much time arguing that perhaps ''Dan Brown was on to something...''

===Charles Manson working for clients?===
[[Image:Mansonclients.jpg|thumb|Ha Ha Ha Ha, Dumb Americunts!]]

Conventional Jew regard the Manson murders as a Satanic ritual killing, the work of a madmen. Fact is, Manson is not your ordinary madman. He is confirmed Illuminati.  While Manson may have duped his brainwashed cult followers into doing the killings for Whitey vs Blackey, it is also noticeable that the people targeted were not just random folk. Sharon Tate's husband Jew may have wanted her dead. She may have known too much. But skeptics argue that Polanski is too nice, and that there is a fine line between drugging and anally raping a kid and getting your own wife killed. The LaBiancas were running a successful supermarket chain, making a lot of [[Donald Trump|powerful people ]] angry. Maybe Manson offered his "services" to such clients in exchange for monetary compensation.


===[[Area 51|UFO Cover up at Roswell]]===
This belief, which has only gotten stronger over the decades, is ludicrous due to the fact that nobody--and I mean NOBODY--would go to Roswell.

===The JFK Assassination===
The belief that Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy or acted as part of a team.  Evidence of another gunman, on the grassy knoll only points out that pretty much everybody hated Kennedy.  You don’t live very long if you piss off  the Mafia, the CIA, and the military industrial complex.  The question shouldn’t be “Who really killed JFK?” but rather “How the hell did he live as long as he did?”


===Global Warming===
Please, are you going to listen to anything a hippy commie faggot tells you?  Quick! Turn around, I think I just saw Elvis getting a drink at that Slushie Machine!!!


===The Death of Princess Diana===
25% of Brits polled recently believe that Di was killed because of a plot.  There are several theories surrounding why this plot came to be, most notably the fact that Di planned to marry Dodi Fayed and was going to convert to Islam.  Is it really a plot when everybody knows it is true and can see the truth from a mile away?  


===The Moon Landing===
You can examine the photos all you want and find whatever you want in them.  This still doesn’t change the fact that if you aim a laser at the mirror the Apollo astronauts left on the surface of the moon, the laser beam will bounce back at you.  Since the invention and wide-spread use of Photoshop, this conspiracy theory has stepped from the merely ridiculous into the insanely absurd.


===Pearl Harbor===
This is not a conspiracy theory, even though a large segment of the population still considers it one.  FDR was a backstabbing commie who allowed American blood to be shed just so his New Deal didn’t fall apart.


===Project Rainbow===
No, it has nothing to do with the [[AIDS|gay conspiracy]]. It's the belief that, for a few brief seconds, a multi-billion dollar naval destroyer completely disappeared during the early days of World War II.  When this theory is weighed against contemporary governmental mismanagement, it is not such a stretch to believe that many billions of dollars can simply vanish.  In reality, this project was nothing more than an international PR campaign designed to scare the shit out of the Japanese.


===The Various Microsoft Wingdings Font Messages===
Is it really a plot when the world’s largest man can do whatever he wants?  People need to get a life.


===The Fatima Prophecy===
Let me get this straight, three kids were in Portugal and they saw things in the sky.  They saw the sun “dance” and they saw several apparitions floating about them.  Let’s add up the facts…the kids were teenagers.  The kids were bored (there is nothing to do in all of Portugal).  They “saw” things.  It sounds to me like the kids got into a bad bottle of vino, and proceeded to STARE DIRECTLY AT THE SUN for awhile. Maybe the whole 'miracle' thing was what they told the doctors to explain why they were suddenly blind.

===Iapetus===
In May of 2009, the Cassini space craft returned pictures of Saturn’s moon Iapetus.  In some pictures, the moon bears a striking resemblance to the Death Star of ''Star Wars'' fame.  The real conspiracy here is that Star Wars nerds are allowed to work for NASA.

===16th Amendment===
Since [[fact|the 16th Amendment was never properly ratified]], income taxes are illegal, and [[lie|you don't have to pay them]]!  Simply let [[The Giver|the IRS]] know that ''you'' know all about their scam.  They will simply ignore your income in return for your silence, since the whole economy would collapse if you told anyone else about it. Make sure to point out the part in the constitution that allows [[Americunts|average hardworking Americans]] to decide the constitutionality of Amendments. PROTIP: it's somewhere in the back.

===Hitler's Head===
Evil Nazi scientists, worried about the future of Nazi Germany, severed Adolf's head and placed the brain within a jar.  For further information, please watch [[Futurama]].


===New World Order===
Conspiracy Theorists often decry that the end is nigh while at the same time stating that a New World Order is emerging.  Seriously, do you think the people who are secretly running the world are dumb enough to forget that the Mayans predicted the world would end in 2012?  If the NWO is really going to take over and form a totalitarian form of government, they had better hurry up.

===Rex 84===
Some [[aspie]] [[basement dweller]] was once dicking around on Google Maps and searched up FEMA and saw what he (and others) strongly believed to be government [[Holocaust|concentration camps]].  Not knowing that concentraion camps are not only what were used for [[Jews|home cooking]], and also not knowing what a [[Katrina|relief camp]] is, he told people they were going to be used so the government could kill [[Mexicans|lots of the population]].  Then this plan was named [[Rex Beowulf|Rex]] 84.


===Tycho Brahe was Murdered===
Who cares?  The guy had a false nose made out of gold.  He was probably mugged.
A more preferable, as well as funnier story than this was the tale about how he died from holding his piss so long he couldn't do it anymore.

===Stairway to Heaven===
If you play Stairway to Heaven backwards it says demonic stuff – This is a great one, fueled by the religious nut jobs during the 1980’s.  Considering the fact that Jimmy Page WAS a Satanist, do you really think he had to hide his messages backwards?


===The Dollar Bill===
Since the 1940’s the dollar bill has been under scrutiny because of the various Masonic symbols that have been placed upon it.  Never mind the fact that the whole country was founded by Masons, large portions of European monies donated to the founding fathers during the Revolution were from Masons, or the fact that just about every president has been a Mason…

I seriously hope this is just a bunch of Catholics who are still mad about the whole Knights Templar thing.


===[[AIDS]]===
The AIDS virus was manufactured by the United States government.  In reality, some chimp fucking furry, who fucked a tainted gorilla in the ass invented this theory to cover up for his nasty habits.


===Crack Cocaine===
There is the belief that crack cocaine was invented by the United States government to “keep the urban black man down”.  Given the fact that pre-crack era urban communities were shitholes, this theory doesn’t really hold much water.


===Religious Cult===
Sometimes, conspirators take it all to a new level.  "It's not the man that's keeping me down, it's the many thetans that are controlling my actions!"  [[Xenu|One religious cult in particular]] have become very prolific, [[Tom Cruise|containing many of our beloved Hollywood stars]].  [[Heaven's Gate|Another one]] is infamous for believing alien's were coming to take us to the next dimension, and that they were arriving at Earth by means of the back of an asteroid.  To make a long story short, [[Suicide|they all drank the kool-aid]].  It's much harder to over come these groups as their arguments are only as unprovable as they are provable.


===[[Worldwide_Masonic_Conspiracy|Jay-Z]]===
The [[crack|crack detectives]] of the internets have found the '''Head of The Illuminati'''.  Of course, it makes perfect sense that the group bent on world domination [[fail|(since the dawn of time)]] would rest their entire plan on a [[rapper]].  Their incontrovertible evidence of his involvement with the "Illuminate" lies [http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/D%27Evils-lyrics-Jay-Z/1187EC8CC5570F33482568CF0001827E here], [http://destinyschildrumours.blogspot.com/2009/02/illuminate-part-1.html there], and [http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread325001/pg1 everywhere].

The [[final boss]] of conspiracy theories. The [[Flat Earth Society]] is dedicated to fighting the wicked conspiracy by NASA to convince us that the earth is round and [[profit]] as a result.

==Conclusions==

When attempting to explain oddities, it is often entertaining or beneficial to manufacture fictions, and it is generally done to appease a child's curiosity in the most expedient manner possible.  Since society is largely full of [[crybaby|grown up children]] who laughingly call themselves adults, Conspiracy Theories are quite popular.  So popular, in fact, that actual studies have been performed regarding these [[Ron_Paul|whackjob]] ideas.  Sadly, the results from [http://people.csail.mit.edu/rahimi/helmet/ this study] only fuel the fire.

==Realistic Conspiracy Theories==
[[Image:Conspiracy Theory - 9.jpg|thumb|Di and Dodi, right before their death.  A realistic conspiracy theory would be: The Royal family didn't want her getting married to a swarthy little man from some Islamic hellhole.]]
As far-fetched and unrealistic as most conspiracy theories are, it would probably be a good idea to give some examples of more realistic theories that can actually be applied to modern life.  The following list, by no means total or complete, is a jumping off point for Encyclopedia Dramatica users to apply to their own lives.  While they will not seem outlandish, fringe, or zany, they will seem outrageous to the average Conspiracy Theorist:

* Education is the best way to obtain wealth.  While communing with your dead grandmother's ghost in an attempt to predict tomorrow's lottery numbers may seem like a perfectly rational idea, going to college and graduating has a much higher success rate.  Also, discovering the government's secret ESP laboratories hidden beneath the Pyramids of Giza is a good way to get yourself shot.

* UFOs are the products of good peyote.  Despite what you have heard, there is an awfully large amount of hallucinogenic chemicals just ''growing freely'' out in the desert.  Is it any wonder most UFO sightings occur there?

* The Earth is not hollow and angels do not live there.  The only thing important going on under the Earth's crust is oil, gold, and other precious commodities.  Go and get some.

* Jim Morrison is dead and his "California Beach Diet" does not work.  If you want to lose weight, stop cramming your mouth full of french fries, stop guzzling Faygo grape soda like it is going out of style, and go outside and cut the fucking lawn.

* Black males do not have huge cocks...yours is fine...really it is...snicker...it's not the size of the ship, but the motion of the ocean...really! ''That may be true, but it's pretty hard to reach England in a row boat.''

[[Image:Paris_hilton.png|thumb|Contrary to the conspiracy theories, [[Paris Hilton]] reveals that fluoride tastes good and yields a +1 to your IRL intellect for 100mg ingested.]]
* Fluoride in our drinking water does not allow the government to control our brains, but it does help keep your teeth strong.  Substituting a few glasses of tap water per day for the sugary poisons you drink now will probably do your health some good as well. Some research indicates that substituting fluoridated toothpaste for fluoridated water will maintain teeth strength just as effectively.
