Old meme
[[Image:Product 49 sm.jpg|center]]

A [[meme]] that has been overly posted, and is usually completely useless. "Old meme" was [[coin]]ed by [[insub]] in reference to the <strike>[http://www.gruntle.org/insub URL meme game]</strike> (broken link) commonly played there as a way to mock those posting memes which were already in the meme database.  Sometimes called "tired old jokes." Old memes are extremely popular in sites such as [[YTMND]], [[Gamespot]], and [[GameFAQs]]. The opposite of an old meme is [[X is now a meme|NAM]].

==Intentional old meme==
[[Some argue]] that after a meme is too old to be [[funny]], it can again become funny by being extremely [[unfunny]]. People who make this argument are [[fucktard]]s who think they invented the concept of [[irony]]. This is referred to as "intentional old meme," and is completely obnoxious. Here's an example of [http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?postid=6185490 old memes wearing themselves thin very fast.]

It needs to be known that "intentional old meme" is itself [[old meme]] and is an [[banhammer|asskickable]] offense, though using old memes to mock a [[Slowpoke]] poster is acceptable if done properly.

===Another example===
<pre>
jackbos: I recently saw an amusing picture of a video game character saying "All your base are belong 
to us".
jackbos: Let's talk about that!
jackbos: And you simply *have* to watch this video I just saw of a Zanger Bob singing a 
song called "Numa Numa"
