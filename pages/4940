== [[LOL WUT]] ==

A lollercoaster can signify a humorous animated image of an [[ASCII]] rollercoaster, [[wat|a place to set your drink,]] or a build-up of events that leads to a [[lulz|lulz-worthy]] [[internet]] [[lollercaust|holocaust]] of [[epic]] proportions.  Much like in the process of [[anal sex|riding a rollercoaster,]] the events build up when someone posts a link on [[b|/b/]] or elsewhere. People catch on as the [[lulz]] reach the top of the lollercoaster. Suddenly, things seem [[uncyclopedia|boring,]] when, all of a sudden, [[Juliana Wetmore|MASSIVE LULZ HIT YOU IN THE FACE LIKE A FUCKING SLEDGEHAMMER.]] This usually means that one of six things happened:

* [[An hero]] occurred.
* [[Faggots]] got [[V&]].
* [[BAWWWW]]ing from [[retards]].
* [[Internet|Websites]] got [[hax|fucked up]].
* [[IRL]] [[rape]].
*[[MCR]] getting Bottled.
Not all lollercoasters are the same, however. Some have an [[awesome]], [[lulz|lulzy]] [[cum|climax]], much like the [[Chris Forcand]] incident. Others have [[fail|disastrous results]] which can incite a backlash of [[faggotry]] and [[AIDS]], much like [[The Great Habbo Raid of July 2007]] (this may be referred to as a [[fail|lollercoaster crash]]). Mini lollercoasters can be found much more often than lulzy ones. These lollercoasters are found on [[Stickam]], [[MySpace|MySpays]], or elsewhere.

== Etymology ==

Pronounced Lawl • ǝr • cö • stǝr, the word lollercoaster originates from Latin. Ironically enough, [[lie|the word itself existed before both]] [[lol]] [[lie|and rollercoaster]], as even then the [[old|ancient]] people recognized [[lulz]]. These days, it's generally believed that lollercoaster is a combination of the words [[Toyota|rollercoaster]] and [[lol]], similar to [[roflcopter]] and [[lollerskates]]. However, this is believed by [[fucktards]] from [[LiveJournal]] who don't know anything.
