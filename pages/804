Bad Vlad
[[Image:PootItInPootinsPooper.jpg|180px|thumb|right|He knows you're reading this. He'll know if you try to edit anything. He will carefully read your changes.]]

'''Vladimir Vladimirovich "Vlad" Putinovich Putin''' is the <strike>former</strike> '''FUCK YES PUTIN CONFIRMED FOR OFFICE IN 2012''' President and current Prime Minister/[[Wikileaks|Alpha Dog]] of China's hat, a paradise of billionaires, natural gas pipelines, sentient [[botnet]]s, and black market cesium known as [[Russia]]. He is that country's leading advocate for the legalization of [[Communism]] and [[Microsoft|global domination]]. In [[2012]], he is set to officially become Russia's [[Roman Empire|Tsar]] in a bid to continue the [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|modernization]] of the Russian political system begun under [[Vodka|Boris Yeltsin]]. He is further notable as the world's first known [[vampire]] head of state.

==Biography==

[[Image:Vladputinlegendofkoizumi.jpg|180px|thumb|right|[[Animu]] Putin.]]

Vlad was born in [[Mother Russia]], lives in [[Mother Russia]], and breathes [[your mom|Mother Russia]].

Upon popping out of his mother's Russian womb, he went to work as a loyal subject of the Tsar. Accomplishments include founding the [[Grammar Nazi|Okhrana]] and personally authoring ''[[Truth|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' in 1903, initiating Russia's pogroms against the Jew menace, introducing Lenin to Marxism, and then orchestrating the USSR's rise and collapse for his own benefit. In 1945 he led the charge into Berlin, and the Wall was his idea; he'd have single-handedly shot down the Airlift if he hadn't also surreptitiously developed the Marshall Plan. Finally in 1999, with the stage set at last, he seized power from the [[Drunk|unconscious]] Boris Yeltsin and has been consolidating his position as [[Peter|God-Emperor]] ever since.

His main impediment to absolute power is chess nerd Garry Kasparov, who insists on standing against him in "elections." In retaliation Putin has put his KGB minions to work building a [[Apple|supercomputer]] for Kasparov to run against in the future; so far they have only succeeded in creating [[Dongcopter]].

Vladimir Putin took time out of his busy schedule as Autocrat of all the Russias to [[headshot]] a tiger which was attempting to eat a TV crew. [http://news.aol.com/article/putin-saves-tv-crew-from-siberian-tiger/154687 No, seriously.] Hopefully, it was a [[furry|furfag]] dressed up as a tiger who intended to yiff some Russians but instead got a well-deserved KGBeatdown. Regardless, it just goes to show how much more of a badass Vladdie is than [[Julia Gillard|the]] [[Barack Obama|pussies]] [[George Bush|who]] [[David Cameron|run]] [[Gordon Brown|your]] [[Kevin Rudd|countries]].

Not only can Vladdie pwn [[tiger]]s, he breaks it down [[42|57]]% [[unwarranted self importance|more efficiently]] than any other world leader in known history. [[Common knowledge|Of course]] [[some argue]] that anyone could kill a tiger with a [[Doom|huge assault rifle]] and 25 KGB agents at his disposal.

On [[Polish Lollercaust|April 10, 2010]], Putin finally attained the oft-coveted ''[[Saudi Arabia|Decapitator]]'' achievement, doing so by using a strategic and patriotic Russian tree to kill the government of Poland ([[Narnia|Aslan]] Maskhadov didn't count because Chechnya is [[Taiwan|not a country]]). He finally considers himself the equal of [[George W. Bush]], who has held the achievement since [[Saddam Hussein|2003]].

===[[God|Immortality]]===

Putin, in a fit of [[badass|completely warranted badassery]] during one of his meetings with [[Italy]]'s visiting [[pussy|PM]], responded to the claim that 'presidents don't live forever' by stating he's '''perfectly capable of living over 120 years''' as President. During the [[pwnt|silence]] that suddenly filled the Kremlin's press conference hall following this official statement, he [[Brawl|announced]] his intention to [[win|run for office]] as soon as [[Sockpuppet|Dmitri Medvedev]]'s reign ends in 2012.

===Videos===
In 2000 Larry King asked Vlad WTF really happened with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_submarine_K-141_Kursk ''Kursk'' submarine]. Putin replied, with a sarcastic smile, «Она утонула» - "It sunk." His answer made [[Captain Obvious]] burst with [[raeg|envy]].

==Nashi==

[[Image:Nashiputinjackets.jpg|thumb|left|Behold der ''Putinjugend''.]]

[[Image:Putin nashi.jpg|thumb|That's right, have no fear; Mega-Putin will watch over all his children.]]

Nashi are a protofascist youth-based personality [[cult]] full of Putin's brainwashed minions. Engendered by Putin's profound lack of brownshirts with which to keep an unruly populace in check (lest they [[Ukraine|Color]] [[Georgia|Revolution]] his ass with [[America]]n [[Conspiracy|help]]), he employed his hypnotic gaze and created this youth movement. They enjoy marching about, singing songs about Putin, wearing clothes with Putin on them, unfurling massive banners depicting Putin, and intimidating anyone who displays a suspicious love of chess. They claim to hate skinheads but actually recruit them, and have a deep, visceral loathing for [[Estonia]]. Their leadership encourages them to resort to violence to resolve ideological incongruity; fittingly their headquarters were [[Win|burnt to the ground]] by [[Leftard|Antifa]].

The word Nashi (наши) translates to "ours," referring to the group's stated aim of providing for "our own" first. While this is foremost a tired political [[cliché]], it is also a clear Russian manifestation of a widespread crypto-xenophobia they share with more than a [[Arizona|few]] [[Tea Party|other]] [[BNP|assholes]] around the world. 

==[[h8r|Hatred]] of [[old media|journalists]] and anyone else who disses Vlad==

A total of [[less than 9000|47]] journalists have been [[pwnt|killed]] in Russia since 1992 for [[asking for it|talking shit about Putin]].

You don't actually have to be [http://capitolhub.com/video/7528/alexander-litvinenko-accuses-putin-politkovskayas-murder a journalist criticizing Putin] to get thoroughly [[pwn]]ed by The Evil Vlad. It's enough to simply talk shit about Teh Vlad to bring his wrath upon you, and it [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6180068.stm ''will'' reach you], whoever and wherever you are.

==Russian Spy Ring==

{{main|Anna Chapman}}

Upon the unfortunate foiling of Russia's ten-year attempt to steal the Colonel's 11 herbs and spices and the exact recipe for Coke Classic, the spies were sent home in the post-Cold War era's biggest single spy swap. Putin welcomed them home with tears in his eyes, longing for his days as a secret warrior, rhapsodizing about their "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10752767 tough lives,"] and sitting down for an old-fashioned patriotic singalong. He then congratulated spy Anya Kushchenko on her number of [[Facebook]] friends and referred obliquely to the completion of ''Phase One''.

Hey World Leaders,

My name is Vladimir, and I'm better than every single one of you. All of your peoples are fat, retarded, no-lifes who spend every second of their day working in the service industry and fighting wars over oil. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever worked for the KGB? I mean, I guess it's fun making fun of the Russian Federation's people because of your countries' pitifully inadequate natural resources, but you all take this to a whole new level. This is even worse than terrorist activity in Chechnya.

Don't be a democracy. Just submit to the Russian bear. I'm pretty much perfect. I was President of Russia for two terms, and Prime Minister of Russia and still completely in control. What offices have you held, other than "[[David Cameron|puppet leader]] of [[Israel|51st state of America]]"? I also get unanimous support from my own people, and have an averagely hot wife (she just blew me; but my mistresses are much better at that). You are all failures who should just kill yourselves. Thanks for listening.

==Why is Putin a [[Crab]]?==

[[Image:Crabputin.gif|thumb|We don't know, and neither does anyone else whose first language is [[English]].]]

"Why is Putin a crab?" (почему Путин краб) is an inexplicable meme developed among the backwards Rs and rabid nationalism of the inscrutable Russian internets, resulting in, well, animated [[shoop]]s of the premier's smiling face grafted onto a crab and frequently running creepily across a beach or seabed. Hilarious, [[No|right]]? This kind of humor apparently fucking tickles the Russians to death, though, as the question is Russian [[Google]]'s first autocomplete suggestion after typing the word "почему" (why) - no word yet as to how far down the list are questions like "why hasn't Putin been investigated for tax evasion?" or "why does Putin get to invent new government posts to circumvent term limits?" - more proof that Russians certainly have their priorities straight.

Like other memes, this one had a mundane genesis when Putin stated in 2008 he'd been "work[ing] like a galley slave" during his latest stint as President, and some Russian [[basement dweller]]s somehow failed at their own [[moon language]] and misheard "[[slave]]" as "[[Giant Enemy Crabs|crab]]." Because, you know, those galley crabs are a real thing and that completely makes sense.
