Fort Longcat
'''Fort Longcat''' is the base of the [[Patriotic Nigras]], serving as the Fursecution HQ of ''[[Second Life]]''. Several versions of the fort have been raided and destroyed by [[racist]] ''Second Life'' mods, so its [[Detroit|current]] location is a highly guarded secret.

== The Beginning of Fort Longcat==

===The Epic Fort Longcat===
In the beginning, Fort Longcat was made of fail. The first Fort Longcat was made out in a field somewhere on public land. This version of the fort didn't last very long since it was built right next to a furry nightclub and was immediately baleeted by the [[Nazi]] Furfaggot Lindens (Moderators of ''Second Life'').

The next several revisions to Fort Longcat were made of moderate [[win]], but were quickly detected and baleeted. None of these forts lasted more than several days. Their destruction was partially due to security issues on Ebaums's boards, which quickly filled up with [[furry]] spies.

The semi-permanent "New" Fort Longcat was the largest and best, yet extremely unorganized due to random expansions. The original was a simple conglomerate of memes, Batman, and Longcat. This was simple and effective, but had a strange air of incompleteness.

One night when everyone was asleep, a freshly inaugurated Patriotic Nigra called Stakedick [[cock|Hitchcock]] expanded the Fort greatly with many walkways and [[shit|shitty]] buildings. This led to the creation of Meme Tower and the business district. The new Fort Longcat was renamed as Epic Fort Longcat.

'''All pics of this fort are below.'''

===Business District===
The Business District was populated by Shoppette Lol and Nig & Nig General Sales, which sold various memes and [[goatse|pr0nz]]. The two competing businesses often raided the other's store, and once Shoppette Lol was even burned to the ground. Also, Admiral Ackbar's home resided in the Business District. 

Nig & Nig General Sales was the second store to be [[Your Mom|erected]] upon the [[goatse|fertile air]] of the Business District. Its foundation was inspired by the shittiness of Shopette LOL and the drive to provide the Patriotic Nigras with [[shit|quality]] goods at reasonable prices. The owner and operator, Narwhal Food, produced a highly acclaimed line of prefabricated buildings that most builders in the Business District purchased and used for their own use, including the owner of Shoppette LOL, who used the insurance money from burning his store to the ground to buy said building.

The first generation of Shopette LOL was a small and [[shit|shitty]] hut made of bricks and fail. However, Shopette LOL was the only shop available at the time. The shop sold mostly [[penis|dongs]] and meme textures to be used on objects. However, on the creation of Nig & Nig General Sales, Shopette LOL needed to quickly expand and improve to stay [[shit|afloat]]. The owner and operator, Stakedick Hitchcock, turned to Narwhal Food for help, since he himself had no building skills whatsoever. Narwhal Food sold Stakedick Hitchcock his new product, the Shop Kit. Nearly every building in the Business District used this kit for their structures.

===Retard Room===
The [[you|retard]] room (see the bottom for pics) was a room where one could go to laugh at pictures of retards. This was where Princess Tzara, the cockslut, was tricked into walking into. Once inside, she realized that the door had been sealed and she was staring at a picture of herself. This was easily evaded by teleporting 10 feet away from where she was standing. However, the ruse generated many lulz from the perpetrators, Narwhal Food (the creator of the picture) and Stakedick Hitchcock (the creator of the Retard Room).

===Soviet Room===
The Soviet Room was created in honor of Motherland Russia. Inside was a shrine to Stalin, Lenin, and "ENJOY CCCP". It was made entirely of fail and chrome, but was made for the lulz anyway.

===Meme Tower===
A large structure built of [[old meme|old memes]]. It had a unique feature that the windows allowed those inside to see out but those outside would only see a meme. The second floor of the Meme Tower holds a sex dungeon while on the 3rd floor a replica of the [[WTC]] was on display. The tower contained virtually every good meme ever, inside and out, and on all four sides.

===Middle Deck===
This area was mostly memes, and was the most populated and visited area of Fort Longcat. After realizing that Hell was infected with [[AIDS]] forever, the Nigras moved upward and constructed a less offensive and more lulzy area. This soon became shadowed by expansion, but is a valuable view on the history of Fort Longcat's development, and a horrible reminder of what was lost.

===Hell===
Also known as the shitty lowest level, Hell was the original structure of Fort Longcat. Though it used to be made of win, and a place where one could pick up cool weapons such as a semen spouter gun or a watermelon cannon, it became place where no one wished to venture, as it was filled with annoying sounds such as [[Batman]] screaming and a perpetual rocket noise. We couldn't get a good picture of Hell because every time we got near it, our eyes burned and our ears bled. Luckily, it's gone forever.

===Baleeted===
At 7 PM, EST, on January 15th, 2007, disaster struck. The retarded Nigra [[retard|Cockhitch Hitchcock]] decided to bounce around a million cubes and the most annoying noise ever, eventually crashing the sim. Fort Longcat is still usable, but we still hate Cockhitch anyways. He couldn't even figure out how to teleport somewhere lolz.

==FL Becomes A "Permanent" Fixture==
On January 15, a Nigra who wishes to remain anonymous purchased some land, but he was retarded because it's the smallest piece of land you can own and it can only hold 117 items, not even enough for one twentieth what the last Fort Longcat was. After teh monies were paid, the Nigras proceeded to crash the sim with Marios, pissing off the person who just sold them the land.

After another retarded Nigra crashed the server with Mario spam, the land was apparently taken from the PN, by either the region/sim owner or SL staff themselves. There was a twist however, from PN forums:

"This is the guy who owned the sims where the glorious PN's tried to create the first legitimate Fort Longcat. As usual, they blow harder than they really are.

[[intLib|intLibber]] is actually Mike Lorrey, a 38-year-old libertarian blowhard who apparently advocates free speech and un-PC-ideas until they show up in his backyard. He's also the sort of dickhead who gives his SAT (1340) score and IQ (A supposed 160, which would make him smarter than Einstein, or basically anyone living) in his personal bio. Trust me, this has all been crosschecked and this is our guy.

*http://mikelorrey.com/

*http://intlib.blogspot.com/

As far as I can tell this guy has a personal vendetta against the glorious PN army now. He owns the nine sims surrounding the sim that FL land was purchased on."

The Patriotic Nigras had unintentionally trolled this blowhard, creating lots of [[lulz]] as he bitched about them on his [[attention whore|blog]].

===...Except Not.===
On January 16th, 2007, the [[furry|owner]] of a neighboring parcel found out about the fort.

As Fort Longcat was big enough at this time that it spread across two parcels (divisions of land); a large amount of the fort was actually in her land. She had logged on and reportedly attempted to build something on her land, only to get an error from the ''[[Second Life]]'' client, claiming the parcel was "full".

Needless to say, the owner wasn't too happy about being unable to build on her land. She destroyed what she could of the fort, and presumably contacted the owner of the parcel containing the rest of the fort, setting forth a [[Harry Potter|series]] of fail and AIDS which eventually destroyed the entire fort...leaving nothing.

Thus was the death of Epic Fort Longcat.

==WE SEARCH FOR HOURS PART 1==

WELL IT ALL STARTED WITH MOOTY, LOLWUT, AND I CAME TO THE EMPTY SIM FOR A NEW FORT LONGCAT! WE B& BIME ESCAPE FROM MOOTYS PN FORUMS, BUT HE FOUND A WAY TO FOLLOW US TO THE SIM, AND WHEN WE GOT TO THE SIM, THE PLACE WAS NO BUILD. LINDEN BANNED MOOTY. LOLWUT WAS ATTACKED BY A SECOND LIFE MERCENARY, AND A LINDEN. AND I WENT FACE TO FACE WITH A KAAAAAAAAAAAARA TIMTAM. I WAS BANNED FOR HOURS. A Nigger: "/OH LAWD HOURS BE A LONG TIME MISSA" WELL IT SEEMED LIKE HOURS, BUT ANYWAYS I WAS SEARCHING, NOTHING ON THE SCREEN BUT A BANNED IP. GOOD THING I FOUND A MAGIC PROXY. LUCKILY A SOCKS4 PROXY WAS IN FRONT OF ME. A Nigger: "OH LAWD SOCKS4? SOCKS4 MEANS EASY IP TO TRACK WHICH BE BAD MEDICINE." WELL THIS SOCKS4 WAS GOOD MEDICINE FOR ME.

==HBKR and Castle Longcat==

[[Image:Brandnewflgo7.jpg|right|thumb|HKBR Longcat. Lulz dark.]]

[[Image:Castlelongcat.jpg|right|thumb|Castle Longcat]]

===HKBR===
During the long-lasting fort in the Digital Empire sim (which got raped by spam and retained its laggy conditions for two months), a sim was found and used to erect a decoy fort. Nothing at all happened with it and was deemed safe after the fall of Digital Empire. Shit was built in the air. Nigras then had a grand old time shooting the new shiny fun friend launcher lowering the time dilation to less than one tenth of a normal sim. Eventually the blocks were railgun'd away, and the fort was deleted the next day. Shit was built in the air and deleted, again. Then finally, shit was built on the ground and deleted. However, the sim was set to no-build and is currently another fucking useless server.

===The Transition===
The 10 days between the time that HBKR was found out, many Nigras kept searching for new sims to make the fort. About 9 new small forts were, and all of them were destroyed by lindens who were told off by spies (Bima Escape).

===The Search is over===
Around March 25th, the Nigras found Paperboy Co. The sim was full of Japanese crap and owned by the same person as hbkr. This gave nigras a new hope for the new Epic Fort Longcat, called Castle Longcat. Around 6 Nigras came at first and built the castles first three floors, then the Longcat and the floors on top of it, then the gunshop, then the graveyard, then the prison, then mootykips grave. The Patriotic Nigras had outfitted the castle with cannons, a tower of [[Longcat]] and [[Tacgnol]], a graveyard to remember those brave Nigras who had been [[b&]] in the wars against [[furry]] scum, ramps for Partyvan jumping, and many [[4chan|memes]]. Nigras rejoiced and chikins were fried. However this didn't go on for long.

===Deleted===
About two days before the fort was gone, two spies from the JLU came in as Nigras to find the new base (Bima Escape and Lobo Kong). They both reported and bawwwww'd to the lindens about niggers building shit in an idle sim. However no sign of the owner taking action was made. A Linden appeared suddenly, so Nigras deleted what they could. Moronically, the Linden did nothing, leaving fragments along with drop boxes at 600 meters high. A week later after the commotion had died down, a shitty, sizable lean-to was created. After one day of existence, the JLU appeared causing the Nigras to disperse. Drop boxes remained for an entire fucking month and was a frequented by new accounts, stocking up on weapons. Its demise came about as Nigras began to use it as a main fort, ultimately leading to an entire wiping of the sim.

==Desert Longcat==

[[Image:Speech.jpg|thumb|The conference room deep inside the fort's superstructure.]]

'''ZOMG PICS TO COME SOON'''

Right after Castle Longcat was discovered. The Nigras were jumping fences, [[Lie|swimming]], and running in order to hide from the lindens. After running for miles, one smart nigger talked about his small fort in far away rocky desert known as Stoll. The nigras then traveled for days and then finally got there. All of them then started to relax in the pool and shoot guns for the lulz in addition to Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool, and all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school. The Nigras then started to build their epic small fort into the biggest hueg like Xbox fort ever to grace the Nigras. Known as Desert Longcat/Castle Longcat #2/SandNigger LongCat, the fort was known for the Nigra Flying Dooms ship, The hueg superstructure that held among the top of the original fort and for the amount of storage facilities. But all was not well in the fort. About 6 days later, Bima Escape (JLU spai) came to Desert Longcat to spai on the Nigras. After the arrival of Mooty and Nexis for the raid against Furry Park. Bima Escape then reported everyone that was there. The next day, as all Nigras were sleeping in their desert castle. Hueg air raids from Lindens were made as they carpet bombed (B&) every single Nigra in the fort. After the raid, only a few Nigras were left as they glimpsed at the remaining ruins of Desert Longcat.

===All quiet before the storm===

After Desert Longcat was destroyed and [[over 9,000]] Nigra accounts were killed. Furries/lindens/Justice fags were in rejoice. However it was not long for the Nigras to rebel. The first official epic raid was about to set forth a new way in the Nigras lives.

'''First with the destruction of what was left of the base...then the attack against the JLU.'''

==Outpost Longcats of PN==
Known as Outpost Longcats, outposts in SL were made so that Nigras could retreat after a raid to a small base without getting lindens or spies to track them to the real Fort Longcat. Nigras were known to discuss false and yet convincing plans for a next raid there to lure spies away. Most outposts that were made were small and only took about 5 minutes to build (mostly with an already built prim that would spawn the small fort). Out of all outposts that were made from March-April, The most popular outpost was called Dibiza, in which some fag forgot he paid $2,000 for a shitty server. Exploiting a now-fixed bug that allowed a person to build on a no-build, the Nigras lay down decorations and boxes containing raid materials. Around mid March, a nigger found this tropical island. Already abandoned, Nigras came to this island to build the first outpost. The outpost was to show a territorial mark for Nigras as they set foot on the owners lands. After Castle Longcat was destroyed, Nigras soon then created more outposts around the grid for new alternative areas for Nigras to build their forts.

==Fort Longcat has been canceled==

===First Warning. NO MOAR FORT LONGCATS-Nexis===

Castle Longcat, in ruins. Desert Longcat, in chaos. The Shrine (Woodbury University), filled with drama. After four months of making Fort Longcats in SL. The time for them had stopped as Nexis said on April 13th.

'''"TL;DR Version:

'''No more Fort Longcat due to angry lindens.'''

'''Sermon Version:

'''Fort Longcat has long been a warm place in the heart of many a Nigra. Most of us have fond memories of fucking around at the fort, whether it was building a shrine for Afroduck, dispelling a furfag raid, or constructing the fort itself. Many Nigras have been trained and born at Fort Longcat. Many forts have been built and destroyed over time, and it has become almost a duty for a Nigra with time on his hands to construct a new meeting place for the others.

'''However, this practice is no longer acceptable.  

'''Fort Longcat has always been a congregating place for the humble and oppressed Nigra, and Lindens, JLUfags, and others know this. Time and time again, Lindens have stopped by the fort in order to demolish it and mass-ban the unfortunate Nigras who were there. This has become so frequent that forts are built and destroyed within hours of each other, and countless precious MACs and IPs are banned before we can even complete OP: SL or anything else. In addition, land owners associated with Fort Longcat are being banned left and right (Tizzers, MC, etc).  

'''It is time we halt this stupid cycle and stop constructions of all new Fort Longcats. We will not make Linden Lab's work easy for them. If they want to ban Nigras, they can come after us one by fucking one. No more fish barrels for you."'''

===LOL NO!===

After Nexis made his speech about niggers not hanging around forts anymore. The Majority of the PN still made forts and outposts. This however changed when Mooty found out that niggers were still building.

===SECOND AND FINAL WARNING - Mooty===

After many Nigras disobeying Mooty, and kept making forts. On April 19th, mooty shifted into serious business mode and told the Nigras to knock it off or its the Cotton field for you!

'''"The next one to mention FL on these boards gets permabanned.'''

'''Also, anyone setting up a FL will be permabanned as well.'''

'''thanks'''

'''- mootykips"'''


==New Ruler, New Opportunity==
With Mooty gone, a new ruler has taken claim and has written down the rule that Fort Longcat will be given a rebirth. With this said many Nigras cheered and have gone to sims to make a new glory in the Fort Longcat Saga.

==New Ruler? Moar liek new furfag==
It turned out that the new ruler of PN in August was a stupid redneck named Jwan (Jesus Was A Nigra), due to intense butthurt, Jwan left with tears after being picked on. After Jwan left and became enemies of the lulz. ^Ban^ took his place, however no one has made a Fort Longcat yet.

==The Continuation of the Epic that is Fort Longcat==
The [[Patriotic Nigras]] have recently initiated the construction of more Fort Longcats. Coming soon to a theater near you.

==The Gmod Map==

[[Image:Gmodfortlongcat.jpg|right|thumb|May god have mercy on our souls.]]

===The...What?===
Some Idiot decided to make a terrible map of Epic Fort Longcat for Garry"s mod. It apperantly has a burning Shoppette Lol and a Nig and Nig's General Store, facing each other. it is mostly a randomly strewn up map with dead memes. How Pathetic.

The map can be found here:

==The New Fort Longcat, this time with copybutter==

<s>On January 13th, 2011, the remaining Patriotic Nigras banded together to create a new Fort Longcat which would dwarf all previous ventures in the history of man. It would be a luminous beacon that the cock of the internets was erect again, and that 2011 would be a year of daily, painful rape for the innocent assholes of Second Life. It would be the greatest edifice man had ever seen. It would have intense, photorealistic detail with custom-made texture maps and high-quality sculpting. It would be stolen from some other shitheads who worked harder and had more skills than any of the nigras.

This new Fort Longcat boasts impressive visuals, expansive spaces, meme nostalgia of every kind, as well as an armory filled to the brim with weapons, avatars, vehicles, and other items necessary for the Nigra's duties. Some are brand new, updated for modern needs, others are vintage, from the Nigras' golden era. 

The location of this new Fort Longcat is as secret as ever - suffice to say it is in an abandoned area time-tested to be free of interloping pubbies and lawmen. Fags interested in proving their pitiful worth to the Internet Hate Machine should register SL accounts. (secondlife.com) Once you have a stupid account, search for the account "Glem Glom" and ask for permission to come aboard.</s>

'''[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]'''

Fort Longcat was [[baleeted]] again by those pesky Lindens. Contact "Soviet <s>Suppenkraut</s> <s>Threebeards</s> Gummibaum", inb4 b& again, for more infos.
