Pennsylvania Pedo Cam

Once upon a time in a magical far away land named [[Pennsylvania]], a vice principal by name of Lindy Matsko confronted a student about slangin' [[dope]] as caught on film. The problem with this film was that it happened to be on a remote-accessed camera on a laptop the little bastard was assigned to halp his lrnin'. Being the retard that she is, Matsko confused candies for pills. Lovely how [[America]] is scraping the bottom of the [[retard]] barrel to administer and enlighten our youth. 

At Harrinton High in the Lower Merion School District, [[pedobear]] has infiltrated to the highest rungs of the school administration. 

==The Supposed Reasons==
The remote-accessing software was reportedly to be used for finding stolen and misplaced laptops. It would allow one of the two people who had permission to do so to turn on the camera and take remote pictures in such a fashion that kept the camera from showing it was functioning in normal programs. This little detail was not included in the paperwork that students signed when they received the laptops as part of their education. Some claim it is no big deal and the school has a right to monitor it's property. Others claim it is an invasion of privacy. Both sides are fucking stupid if they think a little publicity is going to hamper surveillance efforts in [[America]].

{{squote|"Schools have very limited authority under the Constitution to deal with things that are off-premises after hours and have nothing to do with the school itself, so in this case I think the school was out of bounds, literally. Schools are schools, police are police, and they never should meet."|Parry Aftab - Internet Privacy Lawyer (Holy shit, E-Lawyers do exist)}}

The above quote is pretty much true, unless you're living in a police state. Oh wait.

==Conform or Die==

A wide variety of sources, most notably former students, have come forward with the strange behavior both of the laptop and that of the school administration. Having the laptops was mandatory for some school classes, you could not disable the cameras, and jailbreaking a school laptop to secure it was grounds for expulsion. If you used your own personal computer for school projects, it could be confiscated as a violation of the school's Code of Conduct. Congratulations. Complete enforced monitoring of private citizens by [[sick fuck]]s. And of course, the authorities are denying everything. Naturally.

This wouldn't necessarily have blown up to be a major issue save for some other minor details. According to prior students, the green light that indicated the camera was on would periodically come on now and then when it should not have been. Most attributed this to it just being a piece of shit. Now it is far more likely that the holder of the laptop was being monitored. It was reported that administrators told students that spoke of it that it was likely a glitch and they could investigate it while they took a loaner laptop for a short time. [[lol|Nothing strange about that at all.]]

==Mike Perbix==

It appears that one Mike Perbix is the one that [[Pedobear]] bribed to facilitate this gross breach of privacy as he was the Network Tech that appeared to mastermind the operation. The program of choice was LANRev which is a remote monitoring program. Some people are saying that this program is completely harmless. Others point out that it can specifically allow one to bypass an Operating System feature to not allow a webcam to be remotely turned on. Who could possibly have bad intentions with that sort of power?

Dipshit did the [[partyvan]] a valuable service in talking about how exactly he set everything up and used the program in a promotional webcast. Apparently, he did not learn the [[pedo]] equivalent of [[rules 1 and 2]].

Though it did not make a lot of sense at the time, Mike posted details on a script to enable and disable iSight cameras to assist another user. He made clear in his posting that it would prevent the laptop itself from recognizing the use, but would allow a remote administrator to have full access to the camera for hours of [[fap]]ping.
