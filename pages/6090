Otaku

[[Image:Otakubrain.jpg|thumb|right|A scientific analysis.]]
Though in [[Japan]] this word has an extremely negative connotation linked to [[sick fuck]] [[basement-dweller]]s obsessively stalking their graven idols, '''otaku''' is slung around in [[America]] by [[16 year old girls]], [[wikipedophile|30-something basement dwellers]], and [[80 year old Chinese man in panties]] in a puerile attempt to scream about just how BIG a fan they are of [[anime]]. For the most part, they are [[4chan|unwashed monstrosities who can't stop masturbating.]]

Otaku (to Americans) is to anime as [[Trekkies]] (to [[you]]) are to ''[[Star Trek]]'', only they are more annoying, and infinitely more deserving of a shiv between the shoulderblades. The more hardcore Otakus argue that Japan should have won [[World War II]].

A self-proclaimed ''otaku'' can be identified on [[livejournal]] by its numerous posts full of anime-related [[quiz]] results and/or delusional rants about anything that has even the slightest possibility of being anime-related.

FUN FACT: "otaku" is the male form. So, if [[wapanese|you're]] scouring google for [[Inuyasha]] [[fanfiction]] or hot [[16_year_old_girl|otaku]] ass to rape, beware!

ANOTHER FUN FACT: Otaku think they're bad ass as they say "i LoVe mEtAl sOoOo kAwAi ^-^!!!!", when they don't have a fucking clue of what it is. (get real fools, [[Slipknot]] and [[Dragonforce]] blow ass)[[fail|.]] <s>Some</s> All of them tend to mix nerdy anime with <s>actual</s> wannabe metal songs (Falling Away From Me is SO FUCKING KVLT), causing [[lollercoaster]]s sometimes, and some beatings too. 

==In [[Japan]]==

Otaku means "honourable house" and used to be very polite term for "[[you]]" (with relative strangers); in the fandom sense, it was lightly insulting and used sarcastically in Japanese because it involved using a cold honorific on obsessives who probably don't deserve it (Japanese people are all amnesiacs and require constant reminding of who they are). Originally referring only to train-spotters and the like, the "house" part has caused it to drift into also being used as a heavily derogatory term for [[geek]]s who don't leave their houses. Mainly because it was discovered that a suicidal serial [[moot|child rapist]] in Japan sometime back had an extensive collection of [[lolicon]] and only ever left his house to get more. It is generally written only in [[Dick|katakana]], to distinguish it from the non-derogatory use of the word, and to emphasize the fact that only stupid [[Wapanese|foreigners]] would ever take pride in such a label.

==In [[Malaysia]]==

In Malaysia the term otaku also means a [[pedophile|pedopheliac]] [[anime]] freak or other [[Weaboo]]. The local type are easy to spot; just show the otaku a few pictures of girls and ask it to choose one, the selected is sure to be the most under-aged. One Malaysian state, Melaka, has become a particular breeding ground.

=== [[Chilean Mole People|Chihara Minorin Incident]] ===

Something which stays true to even this case, as the seiyuu Chihara Minori, also known as Minorin to her fans, became the victim of an stalking Otaku who ultimately was after her water bottle.

The entire event took place at the recent Daicon anime convention, held in Melaka, Malaysia. Minorin whom was there for a singing appearance, where completely unaware of the predator around her, whom had seen her drink out of an bottle of Evian mineral water, and when it was left “unattended”, he seized his chance.

In the world of those whom [[virgin|never really had their intimate moments with the opposite sex]], a moment like this is highly considered as a chance to have a one on one session of ''indirect kisses''. The proud Otaku was even enjoying himself to such a length where he exposed both his story and posted photographies of himself having the most deepest love relationships with the bottle which have once touched the lips of Minorin, on his blog.

It seems Minori herself is as yet blissfully unaware of this liquid theft, though with the propensity of such scandalous news to propagate wildly across the Internet, true fans can only hope that she be preserved from the knowledge of just [[Jizz|where her fluids ended up]].
