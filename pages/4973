'''Lost Furest''' is a sim in [[SecondLife]] made for making [[furry|feral]] avatars. These avatars cost 3000 L$ a pop, proving yet again that [[Jeremy Bernal|a fool and his money are soon parted]]. Founded by [[fag|furries]] and made for furries, the drama has potential for the lulz. That, and it can be rather [[redundant]] on their part to continue their constant whining about other [[cosplay|roleplay]] sims and other avatars. They've recently posted a [[BAWWW|copybot]] accusing another virtual avatar maker of stealing their work.

This video was posted just days after the release of the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrxKQ_k1fTc Timber Wilds avatar]. It shows the 'stolen' avatar performing all the animations next to a Lost Furest wolf in sync with each other for comparison.  The animations are useless, however, as their movement across and interaction with the ground is obscured due to being green-screened.  Apparently someone wanted to cover up the more obvious differences.

Lost Furest is also known for its complete [[fail]] and [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|contradicting statements]]. For example, both of these comments were left on the same video.
{{quote|We believe the comparisons in this video show beyond a shadow of a doubt that not only were our products referenced, parts of them, such as various animations, were replicated almost exactly, with only very small changes made.|Whining hard.}}
{{quote|We are not accusing anyone of anything, this is simply a video for people to judge'|Playing both sides.}}

===Copyright Baw and Inaccuracy===
It seems the owners and admins and such at Lost Furest have no idea what they're talking about. First they say they want to take legal action, then threaten the 'opposing' company for suing, they yell [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works "Berne Convention"] repeatedly.  What both companies [[fail]] to realize is that [[SL]] is pointless and that L$3000 is $12.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_v._Borland Not exactly big time].
