'''David Gerard''' aka '''Red Drag Diva''' is a senior [[bureaucratic fuck]] on [[TOW]].  David Gerard is meant to be an indication of just how serious Wikipedia is at becoming a well-known and respected encyclopaedia.

Gerard's favorite weapon is the [[Wikipedia:WP:CLUE|Clue Stick]], although you will never see him hit himself with it. Currently, he's on the waiting list for a vaginoplasty.

== Update as of January 2010 ==

David's wife, Redcountess, has left him and has returned to Australia forever.  David is now engaged to be married to Arkady.

== You know what's really scary? ==
All of this is ''absolutely'' true.  It hasn't been altered for [[lulz]].  This is 100% actual factual truth.  It doesn't need to be lullified.  He really is a bisexual goth s&m freak with a disabled wife and [[furry]] girlfriend, and he got that girlfriend pregnant, while his wife has her own girlfriend.  He really is a senior member of [[Wikipedia]] - the motherfucking UK media spokesperson and a Checkuser.  He is meant to be respectable!  He uses his real name in all of this.  These are his real photos that he took himself, and has listed for public download.  It is very difficult to find "normal" pictures of him - or Arkady - or "Red Countess" (his wife).  It is just plain and simply impossible to make any fun of him any worse than this.  What more could you say that isn't actually true already?  David Gerard himself is disappointed that this article doesn't make fun of him more.

==Anti-$cientology==
David Gerard migrated to [[TOW]] with a group of anti-[[Scientology]] buddies from [[alt.religion.scientology]], notable [[Kelly Martin]] and [[Tony Sidaway]] who are both to a degree transexuals like David. It is unknown if David participates in the [[Project Chanology]] IRL protests but it would be a sad loss if he did not because his ugly-sex-vampire-like, mock Lucius Malfoy, dress-wear would make for memes better than [[gas mask girl]].

== Virgin Killer ==
Inevitably, David Gerard was in the lead on [[Virgin Killer]], going onto the radio to protest at ISPs having the temerity to want to protect their customers from illegal child porn. "[[Lie|Wikipedia is not censored]]" he foamed.

It was discovered that David has a vested interest in keeping porn sites up and running, being [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=21845&st=0&p=146455&#entry146455 the proprietor of] [[Lemonparty]].

== Checkuser and Oversight Revoked ==
Gerard's CU and OS flags were yanked as a result of [[Lulz|posting confidential communications on a public site]], and making abusive [[Twitter|Tweets]] on a Wikipedia user and the subject of a BLP article. The Arbcommies posted an announcement about this and screwed up, and abused oversight to cover up its tracks. Here are the email and tweets, incase they get deleted. Oversight this, Arbcommies:

Mr Gerard,

I am told you made reference to me in your musings on Twitter. I don't know
you, would rather not have to become familiar with who you are and what on
Earth possessed you to comment so freely about me or to edit Wikipedia to
say absurd things about me.

Your entitled to your opinion of me but I think it might be best for you to
discuss claims you make about me with me first. If you don't, I'll promise
to return the favour after an investigation into exactly what ails you. And
that really would be a waste of time for me and a very unpleasant outcome
for you, so I urge you to Twit more carefully in future.

Yours sincerely

Andrew Landeryou

I look forward to an exchange involving pie charts.

p.s.: if you donâ€™t want your months-long-running Wikipedia shenanigans remembered, it helps not to have done them. Oops, too late.
