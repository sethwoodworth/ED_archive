On the [[internet]], ruled by various [[Chan|chans]], [[Something Awful]] and [[YTMND]], there are many lesser-known [[Shit nobody cares about|peasants]] that sometimes pop up in a small corner on the web. '''[http://firesforum.forumotion.com Fire's Forum]''' is one of those little [[Forum|web forum boards]] that [[You don't have any friends|don't have any friends]] and [[die alone]].

Fireicedude's Forum dates back to [[Last Thursday|2007]], when forums like this were [[Cool|"the totally rad thing"]] for all of the [[13 year old boys]]. As said above, nobody really gives a shit about the forum or has ever heard of it, but with the members having nothing [[Fap|better to do]], Fire's Forum kept on living.

The name does is not really [[Pic Unrelated|related]] to [[fire]] in any way, it's just that the founder's nickname was [[Pretty cool guy|FireIceDude]] and he was [[retarded]] enough to name his [[forum]] in his own pseudonym.

[[TL;DR]]? [[DO IT FAGGOT|Join Fire's Forum today!]]

==History==
[[Image:FiresforumFirstLogo.jpg|thumb|left|Fire's Forum very first logo. The work is astonishing.]]
[[Image:FiresforumNew.png|thumb|left|And one of the newer logo's. I guess they kind of improved.]]

The website was originally a [[Fanboy|fan-forum]] for the piece-of-shit-game [[Club Penguin]], which was then famous amongst prepubescent [[retards]]. [[Sarcasm|At that time, there were absolutely NO other Club Penguin fan sites on the web]], so Fire's Forum was half [[dead]] upon its creation, being a complete piece of [[shit]] and not having any [[User|members]].

The site [[God|master]], Jew [[advertise|advertised]] Fire's Forum as much as he could, and [[Last Thursday|eventually]] the forum finally got its first members - [[Facepalm|his own brother]] and some other retard from the [[Serious Business|official]] [[Club Penguin]] forum.

Suprisingly, the forum managed to stay active, and as more [[Fucktards|members]] started registering, the forum [[Masturbation|grew and grew]] for many months to come.

As Fireicedude's Forum was [[Party Hard|celebrating]] the website's first [[birthday]], some members considered to [[Final Solution|move on and finally leave the whole Club Penguin thing behind]]. So, at that point, the great [[snap]] had happened, and Fire's Forum, first being a [[Baby|immature forum to discuss pointless things]], had grown to be [[Fetus|a forum to discuss cool things, pop culture and gaming]].

Even after that kind of big change, the forum didn't raise its member count, and actually [[Fail|lost about 10 of them]] (which is quite much, considering Fire's Forum had only 5 active members at the time).

Currently, not much has changed, except now Fire's Forum has decided to make its own [[Video Game|arcade]] (read more below). The number of members didn't rise, either.

==Style==
[[Image:Hello.jpg|thumb|right|Spam this picture everywhere [[for great justice]]!]]
Fire's Forum can be simply named as a [[typical]] forum for [[13 year old boys]]. But [[Last Thursday|sometimes]], Fire's Forum stands out from others. 

===Games===

As a part of the [[Retards|"Assburger Community"]], most of Fire's Forum have decided to join this fucked-up programming language website, [[Scratch]]. Fireicedude, who is now recognized as the [[Facepalm|pro Scratch programmer and hacker]], has made most of the projects, and even lets himself call his [[Shit|shitpieces]] "games".

[[Unwarranted self-importance|In fact, the members were so proud of their creations, they decided to make their own "Forum Arcade" out of games they made themselves]]. But they still can't do any other games other than with [[Scratch]].

===Serious Business===

The [[Admin|admins]] at the forum are apparently very [[Rape|strict]], which frequently remind that "Fireicedude's Forum is [[serious business]]". There are [[At least 100|about 20]] [[Bullshit|rules]], and if violated, the moderators/admins proceed to grind the living shit out of the [[Badass|"rule violator's"]] ass. Such rape had happened only about 5 times, since Fire's Forum is [[Pussy|"not a harsh place"]], therefore Fire's Forum is no fun, [[No|unless you're a great troll]].

So remember, [[Your resistance only makes my penis harder!|5 infractions = Permaban!]]

===Pornophobia===

Some of these highly-feared [[rules]] include things that are just fucking [[Child|sissy]]. For example, these [[Bullshit|16 year olds]] just recently came to a [[Genius|conclusion]] to [[Final solution|"get rid of the "no swearing" rule"]]. [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS|About time you enter the real world, you retards.]]

There also is a rule, "No [[Porn|adult]] content". I mean, c'mon, you guys are fucking 16 years old, [[No|right?]] You're on the god damn [[internet]]!

But that just makes Fire's Forum easier to [[troll|piss off]].

==Flame Wars/Drama==
[[Image:FiresforumFlame.JPG|thumb|right|OH NO YOU DIDN'T]]

As any other place on the internet, Fire's Forum has its own kind of [[Drama|Internet Drama]]. Being a [[Pussy|friendly place]], such battles engage very rarely, however, if they do, they usually commence like this:

*[[Troll|One member]] posts a reply about a random topic, "how bad it is".
*Second member [[Butthurt|disagrees with Prima]], thus engaging an argument.
*The other members observe the debate, tempted.
*Eventually, the two [[retards]] can't find anything else to say, so they start insulting each other.
*As the flame war reaches its [[NO U|culmination]], one of the forum [[Internet Tough Guy|admins]] enter the warzone, and tell them to "calm down".
*The debaters go all "He started it", as more people cut in and try to [[Obama|sort out the situation]].
*The admins consider taking the [[Banhammer]].
*The two retards pussy out, for the forum is all they have, and [[Gay|apologize each other]], ending the flame war.

A good example of the first four points [[Do it faggot|may be seen]] in the picture on the right.

==Trolling==

You didn't pay attention to ''any'' of the article, [[Truth|didn't you?]]

Anyway, the best way to [[troll|fuck up shit]] in Fire's Forum is to [[spam]] [[Goatse]] and [[Meatspin]] everywhere, which will result in [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|panic and stress]]. The [[Moderator|moderators]] only log in once per day, so until they take the [[banhammer]], the whole forum will already be [[Shock image|demolished]]. Take [[Pix or it didn't happen|pictures]], too.

You can also register as [[Hoax|"FireicedudePhone"]], claim that "The forum founder is using his [[iPhone|mobile]]" and tell everybody to go to the temporal forum, [[Last Measure|http://firesforum.on.nimp.org]]. The silly little [[Idiots|children]] have no idea about the [[internet]] and how [[Win|cruel]] it is whatsoever, so it's an easy bait.

===Win===

On August 27, 2009, a [[troll]] named [[Xenu|OverlordXenu]] registered onto Fire's Forum. No-one but the admins knew what was going on after that, but [[OH NOES|everything went downhill]] - Fireicedude disabled registering to the forum, everybody's being [[Stalker|tracked]] and the admins are always wielding the banhammer whenever somebody even [[Fart|farts]].

The admins state that the [[Winner|user]] was posting [[Goatse|EXTREME PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES]].

As of September 3, "[[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|The New account ban]] that started Aug. 26, 2009 due to a new user posting [[Tubgirl|pornographic images]] will remain in effect until Wednesday, Septemeber 9, 2009 for a total of 15 days".

A "New account ban" means that [[Paranoid|you can't register to the forum]]. They take things way too [[Serious business|seriously]].

==Members==

Despite having [[Over 9000|about 200]] members, there are only 20 of them who have actually posted something. Here are the most [[Famous|notable]] fucktards:

===The [[Gods|"staff"]]===

*Jew, forum founder. Claims to be 16, but talks like a fucking [[retard]].
*[[Dog|Golden Retreiver]], Fireicedude's brother. [[Inbred|Sucked his brother's dick]] to the point that he made him an administrator.
*[[Star Wars|Future Sith]] (formerly known as [[Child|Sixpenguin]]), doesn't post much. Also an admin, but nobody knows why.
*[[Wigger|Chainzz]], [[retarded]] kid who claims to [[Bullshit|be fucking 18 years old]]. Nevertheless, still somehow became an administrator. Also sometimes [[Rules 1 and 2|talks about 4chan]] and posts memes.
*[[Internet Tough Guy|Eduardo]] (formerly known as [[Cooldude|Iceddude]]), wigger who ocasionally posts in [[Leet|1337speak]] and [[How do i shot web?|shots]] [[meme]]. Caused many drama on the forum. No, this one's just a moderator.
*[[Nerd|Retrobit]], kid who includes a reference to [[Guitar Hero]] in [[Fanboy|every fucking post]]. Never posts anywhere but the "Gaming" forum.
*[[Gurl|Alicia]] (formerly known as [[Emo|Frozen Angel]]), a fucking girl. At least that's what [[Trap|he/she]] claims.

===Ordinary===

*[[Animu|Joachim]], animu [[faggot]] and obsessed with [[Pokemon]].
*[[Retard|Osh]], fucking [[retard]], only posts to advertise his own [[shit]] forum.
*[[Fucktard|Club Tomzzz]] (formerly known as Tommader), doesn't post anymore, but [[Truth|is the biggest retard on the forums yet.]]

===Trolls===

*[[Xenu|OverlordXenu]] - [[Epic Win|proceeded to spam Fire's Forum with shock images and got instantly perma-banned]]. Read more [[Fire's Forum#Win|above]].

[[99%]] of the members are [[Americunt|americunts]], except the [[gurl]] claims she's from [[Shit nobody cares about|Singapore]] and the [[Wigger|Chainzz]] guy claims he's from [[Lithuania|the middle of nowhere]] (which he oftenely mentions and proceeds to tell story lessons about the nation's history).
