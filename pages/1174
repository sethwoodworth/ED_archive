Not to be confused with [[Scotland|Scots]], [[Irish]]men or [[Wales|the Welsh]] -or '[[Brits]]' for that matter- '''The English''' (or Englishmen) live in a  part of [[Great Britain]] called [[England]]. A veritable cornucopia of inbred animals, the English are a diverse people made of [[poverty]], [[Fail|filth]] and [[Chav|scum.]] [[Alcohol]] is the glue that binds English society, and makes associating with their cold and [[arrogant]] countrymen bearable. In England, the north is filled with people who work in caves for a living. The south is full of arrogant faggots desperate to be American but too proud of their ostensibly sexy accents to actually move. In many ways this divide mimics that in the United States.

==London==
It speaks volumes about the remainder of the UK that out of a population of approximately 60 million, 10 million live in one city.

There are three types of people living in England's capital; [[Rich and beautiful|Londoners]], [[Chav|Cockneys]] and [[Niggers]]. Actually, you could break the nigger group down into [[Pakis]], chinks and [[Poland|white niggers]], but you wouldn't get on a bus with any of them, so why bother? The half of London with a job always fears that the junglebunnies will eventually swell their dole-sucking numbers to saturation point, but since most of them are too busy stabbing each other and [[Chikins|engaging in typical Nigra pastimes]], there's no time left to get the hos pregnant.

London was famously pwnt back in 1666 by some retard of a baker [[kill it with fire|setting his house on fire]]. The Lord Mayor was summoned away from [[Anal sex|important administrative business]] to examine the blaze. Seeing the potential for [[lulz]], he remarked [[Fetish|"A woman might piss it out"]] and went back to his faggotry. This was the first time that the population of London realized that building houses out of dry wood and straw almost on top of each other might not be the wisest of ideas, but they didn't figure this out until [[Epic win|75% of the city had been destroyed]].

==Geordies==

They are under the mistaken belief that Newcastle is the finest city in the world, just because they happened to be born there. In its natural habitat, the Geordie can be found staggering around the streets blind drunk at 11 am, picking fights with random people and shrieking unintelligible bullshit at one another. Whilst such behavior would be acceptable among the Scots, being (nominally) English, the Geordie has no excuse. Like the Glaswegian, you don't have to provoke the Geordie to be threatened with violence. They are also the only city in England that gives two shits about their failing football club. This is apparently the only city south of the Scottish border that the Scots will even acknowledge.

==Felixstowe==

Felixstowe is a small to medium to large to small again sized town situated on the south Suffolk coast, England. Felixstowe does not so much have distinguishable individuals, as much as a constant, never ceasing blur of bland and lifeless inhabitants. Once, in the Summer of 1962, someone saw a cat. The town boasts three main educational establishments: Two High Schools (Orwell and Deben, so named after the two steaming rivers of piss that surround the town), and a third, more popular institution: The Arcades. It is here that Felixstowe's Chavish offspring learn the many skills and abilities that will see them through their impending first stay at Her Majesty's Pleasure. However, it is Orwell High School that still continues to defy all attempts to maintain an efficient schooling system in Felixstowe. This is not to say the institution is without its own achievements.

[[Image:Felixstowe.jpg|thumb|left]]  
Arguably, one of the greatest students to have ever graduated from this fabled establishment is Mark Lankester, who excelled at chemistry. He is now, of course, a world famous Brain surgeon who in his spare time reads to the deaf, and fosters children from deprived areas such as west Yorkshire (specifically the white rose area). He is also married to world renowned martial arts expert Matthew Parker. Mark was particularly noted for his star crossed partnership with Mr D. J. Travers, who sadly perished in the infamous 'Room G6 Incident". He is now commemorated by a 15ft bronze statue on the Netball courts, which the caretaker was quoted to have said is "A fitting tribute to a truly Heroic Chemist". Science has since been banned throughout Suffolk.

Another student who you may have read about in the tabloids is Alex Wold: Who was controversially voted 111th person you most love to hate in a recent channel 4 poll, mainly due to his love rat antics and general sexual excess (hence the gout). Despite various certificates being issued, and occasional claims of pupils receiving an education at Orwell High school...As of yet, no proof is to be found.

==Manchester==

Home to the Manchester United football soccer team, which is worshipped by all [[13 year old boys]]. 95% of Manchester United's fans weren't born in Manchester, and over half of those have never even been to Manchester. No-one actually wants to live in Manchester owing to the fact that it was recently voted the 17th worst place to live in the UK (pipped to the post by, [[sarcasm|suprise fucking suprise]]: [[shit|Middlesborough]]). All true Mancuntians support Manchester City (they can't afford United tickets), and Manchester United's closest fan lives in Guatemala. Every city in the NorthWest of England hates Manchester, and believes it has a personal rivalry with it, when in fact, Mancs have absolutely no idea that everyone else hates them, being too busy robbing cars and overgelling their hair.

==Leicester: Sump of Shite==

Leicester is what the government calls "a multicultural hotspot and an educational action zone". This means that it is full of illiterate chavs, teenage mums, pakis, kurds, [[gooks]], [[niggers]], [[arabs]] and a handful of nice people. Even though the council is pouring £££ into redeveloping the city centre, they are woefully neglectful of teh suburbs, and consequentially the city's 350,000 people are [[ghetto]]ised. The poor white people live in Braunstone, Mowmacre Hill and Noo Paaks (New Parks), where you will get knifed. The poor white people who will shoot you live in Beaumont Leys. The rich corrupt Pakis live in Evington. The Immigrants (Kurds, Albanians, [[Gooks]], [[arabs]] and [[niggers]]) live in the St. Matts estate and Spinney Hill. The richer white people live in harmony with Pakis in Stoneygate, Westcotes and Knighton. The richest, most honest people don't live in Leicester at all.

==Liverpool/[[Scouse]]rs==

Home to possibly the second most annoying accent found in the UK, the first being that of [[fags|Cockneys]]. The European Capital of Culture 2008 (WTF?), [[lies|"Liverpool is diverse, energetic and exciting"]], but apart from some boats, throwing stones at seagulls and shooting children there's nothing much to do there. Every Scouser is aligned to supporting one of the two local football (Soccer) teams. One is full of players who are niggers. The other is full of players who resemble women and a captain whose girlfriends gender is uncertain.

* Every Scouser over 60 claims to have known the Beatles personally.
* Every female Scouser over 60 was asked out by Paul McCartney, but said no.

All Scousers know every other Scouser.

==St. Helens/Wools==
Though the term wools can also be applied to multiple towns around merseyside which nobody gives a fuck about, it mainly refers to the stupid wankers who populate of St Helens. "Wool" comes from "Woolyback", which any wool will tell you originates from some shite about bridges, but we all know comes from fucking sheep. In St Helens, there is one pub, four houses and a rugby team. The team is extremely successful. But it's Rugby Union, so noone really gives a fuck.

==Birmingham/Brummies==
[[Image:Brum.jpg|thumb|A typical Brummie]]
Birmingham was a massive industrial center in the past, and as a result, the whole city (and the sky above it) remains a dank shade of grey ALL THE TIME.  It is this dreary industrial heritage that inspired 4 young men from Aston ([[Heavy_Metal#A_short_history_of_metal|Black Sabbath]]) to create metal, along with friends like Robert [[Weed|Plant]].

It is also home to "Brum" a weird yellow car that had it's own television series around [[100 years ago]]. It drove round and pissed everyone off. In a recent nationwide poll, the Brummie accent was voted "least trustworthy" of UK accents. It was also voted [http://talklikeabrummieday.co.uk "least intelligent”,“least friendly” and “most dishonest".]

==Coventry==

The ancient Coventry city is located just south east of Birmingham, right next to Birmingham's "arsehole" (if you imagine Birmingham is bending over, facing left, and you are viewing her in profile). Coventry just "appeared" on the map in 1043, after a drunken Benedictine monk mistook a cartographers note book for a "scroll" of medieval toilet paper. This is why Coventry is shaped like a smear of shit. Nobody has any explanation as to why it still smells this way, almost 1000 years later. The monk was also married to the legendary Lady Godiva, who is famous locally for bareback horseriding; Englands first recorded beastiality slut.

Coventry has always been hated by the rest of the country, so much so, the phrase "[[fail|sent to Coventry]]" has evolved into the national phrase for losing. Coventry was a major target for Nazi espionage. Apparently the Nazi spies were so appalled at Coventry's nightlife and local women, that they decided to implement a final solution ON THE SPOT, radioing home and asking the Luftwaffe to [[KILL_IT_WITH_FIRE|sort things out]].

==Yorkshiremen/Up-Northerners==
People from Yorkshire are the second most stereotyped people in England, ask someone to imagine an English person and they'll either imagine someone from Somerset or Yorkshire. They open their vowels more than anyone else so that many sentences begun in the late afternoon have to be finished the next day. They live on Tetley's beer and Yorkshire puddings. The best thing they invented is rat-catching competitions for their precious [[dog|Yorkshire Terriers]].

==Mackem/Sunderland==

A poor man's Geordie.

==Goole/Goolies==

A very poor man's Sunderland, Goole is located in "East Riding of Yorkshire", and it's residents are referred to (by themselves, with no trace of irony), as "Goolies". Geographically, Goole is located near England's North-East coast, within Britain's "armpit".

According to TOW, "Goole achieved notoriety in 2000 for having the highest proportion of drug-related deaths in Britain - 13 times the national average. Although only 2 per cent of the population of the county lives there, the town is home to 12 per cent of the region's heroin users."  Due to the lack of ANY education system in Goole (or indeed, up North), it is said that the only successful way out of Goole, is to kill yourself with drugs, and hope that the coroner takes your body to a nicer town, 200 miles away.

Nobody outside of Goole has EVAR heard of Goole.  This is helped by the fact that Goolies have no internets, electricity, or even gas lamps.  A bit liek M.Night.Shamalalalaians "The Village".

==Sheffield/Twok City==
The chief hobbies in Sheffield are drinking, fighting, drinking, stealing cars, drinking and prostitution. The worst council estate there([[shithole|The Manor]]) is full of [[chavs|fine young gentlemen]] and fashioned in a figure of eight, perfect for joyriding.

Sheffield used to be an industrial town famous for steel. Now it's famous for its inhabitants that steal. The people are very friendly, especially around a place round the back of west street where a variety of people will strike up a conversation with you in the most friendly manner, even if they have never met you before. Typical talking points will be the solicitation of a womans [[vagina|company]], or whether you would care to purchase any [[heroin|rare spices]]. Sheffield was also the country that came out on top in a public vote on whether marijuana should be legalised, scoring an impressive 73%. I even smoke it round me grans.
