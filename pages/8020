A '''Tamagotchi''' is a tiny, digital slave bound inside a cheap, mass-produced plastic egg. They (like all cheap, mass-produced, brightly colored [[plastic crap]]) originated in [[Japan|an Asian country]]. Tamagotchis were popular and, like, all the cool kids had to have one at your middle school [[last Thursday]], if last Thursday was in the late 90's. 

==But Why?==

[[Image:Dreamcasttamzibit2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sup Dawg|Now you can play while you play.]]]]

'''Tamagotchi''' was originally intended to amuse children for days by giving them a little creature to care for. It was supposed to encourage nurturing feelings in kids by simulating the experience of having a beloved pet. Really owning a pet is often very arduous and expensive, not to mention both physically and emotionally demanding. With that said, a Tamagotchi was [[lie|totally like owning a real pet]]:

* They could be suspended from a metal ring, clipped to a necklace or backpack and carried with you everywhere. 

* Your initial purchase cost covered the pet's entire life (with a lifetime of food and toys) and you [[Unrealistic Expectations|never had to spend another dime]].

* Your pet's basic needs could be met through cold, unfeeling button mashing. No other exertion on your behalf was ever required.

* If you forgot to feed or care for your pet for a couple of days, it would die. But you could always just stab them in the back with a pencil where there was a hidden reset button, which immediately brought them back to life. In the same manner, you could always relive the best part of a pet, their cute babyhood and adolescence. Anytime they got old and just sat around and [[shit|pooped]], [[wtf|you could stab them back into their adorable infancy]]. If you wanted to stick it out with a decrepit old virtual pet, there was no need to have it put down, as it's life span was a few days to two weeks at best.

Yep, just like real life. Pointing these things out in Tamagotchi forums and fan sites results in great [[butthurt]]; many Tamagotchifags will still attempt to justify their pride over successfully rearing their "virtual pet" or their emotional attachment to them. 

==Tamagotchi Drama==

Many of the lowest points of humanity that occurred in the late 90's were in the direct vicinity of Tamagotchi toys (the rest of the low points were around boy bands). Some schools put up bans on Tamagotchi toys because [[assburgers|emotionally disabled kids]] would freak the fuck out if their beloved digital slave passed away in class. Many a rain forest was felled to create enough Kleenex to sop up the collective tears of grieving Tamagotchifags. Of course, within minutes, just about all grew their balls back and did the right thing - stabbed the plastic, vacant carcass of their deceased pet and reset them back to life. There is some speculation that the resurrection of [[Jesus]] actually occurred in a quite similar manner.

==Characters== 

Yes, they actually have names.

*'''[[Pedobear|Mametchi]]:''' The end result of actually taking care of your Tamagotchi; thus, he is impossible to obtain.
*'''[[Meme]]tchi:''' A female character that is Mametchi's bitch. She comes from "[[Guro]][[Guro]] Town". Coincidence?

*'''Papakurotchi:''' One of the most homosexual characters on Tamagotchi. He is a transvestite with many piercings, wears pink and has a goatee. He is possibly a rapist.

*'''Masktchi:''' A Female character that's apparently Gozarutchi's bitch.

==Versions==

No matter how you look at it, all Tamagotchis are the same with little things changed, lets have a look

*Original: the thing that started it all
*Original 2: Refresh of the thing that started it all
*Bug Version: one with bug Tamagotchis, it gives you the power to yell at it.
*Fish Version: one with fish Tamagotchis, it has a motion sensor so you can shake it like a nanny possessed.
*Angel Version: one where the Tamagotchis are already dead (thats one thing out of the way).
*Devil Version: one where your supposed to keep it from being a [[Troll]]
*Morino Version: One where you can live a bug's life, and get [[pwned]] by a [[human]]
*Dinkie Dino: One where you look after a [[Dinosaur]], so like Rawr and stuff.
*Connection: one where it has an evil red eye that when you have two staring at each other, one of the tamagotchis jumps to the other one, Raepes them, steals the baby, and never sees them again (the perfect crime).
*Connection 2: like last time but you can now win prize money from stupid games, and buy cool crap.
*Connection 3: now you can connect to the internets and learn cheat codes for cool crap.
*Connection 4: one where you can apply for a job interview, but you almost always [[fail]], and you receive [[chain letters]] in the mail. Your tamagotchi also does [[research]] at [[school]].
*Connection 4.5: Yes, it,s the same
*Tamago Chu: [[Rule 34]] [[ftw]]
*Connection 5: Now you take care of a whole family, but instead of dying, they get pissed and fly to there living planet. 
*Connection 5.5 Royal Version: I think you get the idea. You iz a [[god]] in this one.
*Music Star: one where your Tamagotchi gets an instrument and competes on America's got Talent, <b>LOSES!</b> and becomes a street performer sucking dick for a living. And there's Music City where you can sell your ear-bleeding music.
*Color Version: One which wont be had in the US of A.
*Tama Go: Now you can shove a piece of [[plastic crap]] up the tamagotchi's [[pussy]], and play some crappy games. And it's got [[moar]] bigger.

===Other stuff===

Stuff that isn't a plastic egg,

*Game Boy: the first one made into a video game, because people were too lazy to buy the little egg thing. They also over-dramatized the death scene of your Tamagotchi, with that whole "laying on the ground with a heart meter dying out, showing your best memories together (which is essentially it shaking in agony), then it turns into an Angel"   
* Corner Shop: a game on the DS, in this one you have to do random things in different stores. You haz to do the same shit [[over 9000]] times.
* Corner Shop 2: [[lulz]]
* Corner Shop 3: one were you are kidnapped and turned into one of them, then they make you do random things in different stores.
* Party On: A game where you try to become just like [[George Bush]], doing yet again moar random things.

==Blessed Cultural Irrelevance==

Tamagotchis can still be found in toy stores or online, indicating that there is some lingering demand for them. However, no one has stepped forward to claim responsibility for purchasing them and thereby forcing store managers to restock. It's safe to assume that the [[Unwarranted_self_importance|cool kids]] have realized how [[ghey]] Tamagotchis were all along, although they would swiftly [[lie|deny any such accusation]]. Only [[loli|prepubescent girls]] and weirdos with [[neckbeard|neckbeards]] continue to hoard the toys, [[Dying_alone|hoping to one day feel even the slightest bit of affection from another human being]]. Since this is the makeup of the current Tamagotchi fanbase, it's just too easy to troll and make fun of them.

==Tamagotchi vs Australia==

{{quote|I don't want the kids of today to become the gambling addicts of tomorrow with a game like this.|[[Jack Thompson|Because playing with toys will turn you into a monster.]]}}

When the Tamagotchi Connection Version 2 was released in [[Australia]], anti-gambling politician [[Nick Xenophon]] attempted to get it either [[censorship|banned]] or given an [[pr0n|R18+ rating]] because one game featured [[gambling]]. Cue such a wave of Tamatard [[RAGE]] that he [[fail|eventually just gave up.]]
