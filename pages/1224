Bump war
{{needsmoar|'''pictures of it'''}}
{{notice|Bump wars will either be great success or epic fail. If [[you]] start a bump war and it fails, then you will feel very bad about yourself for at least 100 years. Very bad, indeed.}}
To initiate a bump war, you must start it much like a [[flame war]], by declaring;
1, 2, 3, 4, I declare a bump war!

== History of bump warring ==
It is said that many years ago, trolls were getting bored by simply yelling at other people. [[NO U]] and [[lol wut]] were getting boring to use when trolling. A brave Anonymous then came up with the idea of a bump war.
This Anonymous was easily entertained, and at first, the technique was unrefined as a [[16 year old girl]]s [[lulz]] generating. Many used the technique, until it became the dream of every troll to use it. The only downside of this new bump war, or Bump War Version 2, is that it is not as user friendly. That's why there is such a difference in how a bump war will turn out. If you bump TOO many times at once, the lulz are lost and annoyance sets in. If you don't bump enough, then the rest are left salivating for more delicious bump, and then they bump too much, which is [[do not want|not good]].

== Ways to fail a bump war ==
You can fail a bump war by not out bumping the other party in question or giving up. Either way, you need to go be [[an hero]] and end your useless life.

== Ways to win a bump war ==
# [[Rape]] the other bumpers.
# Bump so many times that the forum's bandwidth is [[ass rape|screwed]].
# Make the other regular [[camwhore|members]] cry.
# Don't be a [[furry]]. The bump war god will smite you for [[you are doing it wrong|trying]].
# The object is to obliterate every other warring member. Show no mercy, and take no prisoners.
# [[????]]
# [[PROFIT!]]

== Bump war rules of conduct ==
*Anyone and everyone except for those who initially [[fail]] may start or participate in a bump war.
*Bump wars are best to have in highly sensitive and ordered areas, because ...well, chaos is fun. Why do you think shock sites were invented?
*If someone tells you to stop, tell them [[ass|where to shove it]], laugh, and keep bumping.
*Only an effective trolling technique if it is a coordinated attack.
*Spontaneous bump wars may lead to a [[goatse|smaller penis]]. Generally, experienced trolls should be alright.
