Zeldalink76
[[Image:Itachi_Cosplay_by_Zeldalink76.jpg|thumb|ZeldaLink76, in all her 'Tard glory.]]

{{deviantart|zeldalink76|zeldalink76}} is a [[lulz]]-tastic drama-llama art thief with the [[retard|I.Q. of a slug]].  When told that she can not use people's artwork, she becomes [[butthurt]] and whines how [[no one likes you|life is not fair]].   She proclaims to never have the time to ask artists for permission to use their work, or to credit properly, yet she will [[BAWWWWW|video tape tantrums]], and post them on to YouTube.  When she is losing an argument, because no one agrees with her, she will cry out that it is unfair to [[Fisting|give someone the upper hand]].  Someone other than her, that is.

==Drama==
[[Image:School_Days_by_Zeldalink76.jpg|thumb|No wonder ZeldaLink76 steals other's artwork.  Hers is craptastic!]]

[[image:Anotheronetellsthetruth.jpg|thumb|And another one goes "WTF? I was never asked!]]
[[image:Heresyourproof.jpg|thumb|Here is you proof, ZeldaLink76, that most of the artists are NOT okay with your video.]]
[[image:Likeherself.jpg|thumb|LOLWUT? /b/tard is a big word that makes people feel stupid?]]

The [[drama]] all started when [[devianTART]] [[luser|user]], AmericanLink, asked to have [[shitty art|artwork]] pulled from ZeldaLink76's [[scat|shitty video]].  ZeldaLink76 came up with every lame excuse her tiny mind could to keep the video up, and to use artwork that did not belong to her.  When demanded by HaloBender and DarkLink107 to take the video down, ZeldaLink76 threw an E-Shitfit, saying that she wasn't going to take the video down.

She claimed to not have the time to ask people for their artwork, or to edit the video, yet she had the time to spend five hours on a crap-tastic slideshow set to [[emo]] music.

{{quote|*sigh* So many people have used your art and didn't say it belonged to you and here you are bagging on me and I did!!!! I told you I don't have time for artists to respond!!!|ZeldaLink76}}

{{Quote|You're 15, you should have plenty of time.|GlitterCandy}}

{{Quote|I don't you don't know because [[you're|your]] not [[retarded|me]]|ZeldaLink76}}

She brought the [[drama]] to AmericanLink's [[devianTART]] journal, acting like the [[naruto|E-tard]] that she is.  ZeldaLink76 can't handle being told that [[16 year old girl|she]] is wrong.  She claims that everyone is threatening her, and she whines because no one agrees with her.  No one, except her [[BFF]], {{deviantart|iDeth157}}, who backs down when she realizes she is in the wrong.

She also can not use her own [[shitty art|artwork]].  Considering the fact that you can barely tell what any of her characters are, you can almost not blame her for using other artist's work.  Here are some [[Naruto|examples]]:

As a last resort, knowing that she is [[owned|losing]], she will start name calling, and act as if [[emo|no one understands her]].  She has also had her sock puppet go to other people's devianTART page to proclaim that ZeldaLink76 never stole artwork.  She just could not get permission.  ZeldaLink76 has fallen so low now, however, to harass AmericanLink on the front page, knowing that ZeldaLink76's cause is futile.

===YouTube Drama===
[[Image:Yaoilink2.JPG|right|thumb|The original, now deleted video. This is an understatement]]

Angered by the artists who wanted her to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|remove]] their artwork from her videos, she has decided to make '''two''' YouTube videos consisting of her bitching that she's being [[flame|flamed]], and that it's OK to use the images in her videos, because...

She likes to say "I don't appreciate it" a ton. Don't sit on the cat!<br>
And... ANGRY LOLCOW IS ANGRY!

{{quote|...hands are the root of all EVIL!!!! I understand why she cant't draw them. Was there ever a time in your life when you could not draw hands. [[Internet Tough Guy|Yeah, I thought so]]|ideth157, on her [[IDK my BFF Jill|IDKMYBFFJILL]]'s inability do draw hands}}


Her one and only [[fantard|fan]], tartlet [[deviantart|IDeth157|ideth157]]. The [[cunt|poor thing]] seems very confused, thinking that her [[BFF|"bestest friend forever"]] would be [[lie|truthful to her, always]].  When confronted with facts that Zeldalink76 has indeed [[lie|lied]] to her, she still believes in all her [[loli|childish]] heart that ZeldaLink76 [[Orly|never lied to her since she came into the argument.]]

Several times, ideth157 has gone onto peoples pages saying that she did not want to get in the middle, but asked for people to [[Chris Crocker|leave her friend alone]].  She would then turn and completely agree with her friend. Even telling ZeldaLink76 that she was in the right because she had credited them.  When confronted, she would tell lies, trying to make it seem like she was [[America|"keeping the peace."]]  In all reality, IDeth is a [[Lolcow]] Liar.

==Video in Question==

[[image:Gotthehintfinally.jpg]]

As you can see, she finally got the hint, or got sick of being [[Rape|raped]] by the [[Troll|trolls]]. Either way, it was a [[Winnar|successful victory]].  Of course, it took hours of drama, and several [[Butthurt|pissed]] off [[faggots|artists]], for her to finally take it down.  All drama and anger against her, that caused her to be [[emo]], that she could have avoided if she had half a brain to [[lolwut|RESPECT other artists]].

However, her [[YouTube]] page will be watched carefully.  [[Some Argue|Chances are]], she will think [[fact|we are all morons]], and put it back up again, having not learned her lesson.
