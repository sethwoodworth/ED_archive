Rangers
{{moar|sports drama ([[hookers and blow]] and whatnot). Please see the article on [[New York Yankees]] for an example of doin it rite.}}

No, Rangers aren't some group of guys that hang out with [[Lord of the Rings|Aragorn]] and talk to [[Midget|hobbits]], Rangers are a baseball team that is owned in part by [[Win|Nolan Ryan.]]  Also, Rangers are upsetting to their fans.

Pictured above are [[George Bush]] and Nolan Ryan.  While playing, Nolan Ryan was probably one of the most dominating players of his era...it's too bad his level of win cannot rub off on the team he owns.
