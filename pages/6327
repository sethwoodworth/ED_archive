'''Pekka-Eric Auvinen''' (moar liek PECKER, amirite?) aka '''The Finnisher'''  was an [[Finland|Finnish]] [[pussyhawk|hero]] and [[gun]] fanboy who [[School Shooting|pwnt 6 students, the school principal, school nurse, and himself,]] at [[high school|Jokela High School]] on '''Wednesday November 7th, 2007''' two weeks after threatening to turn the school into a "bloodbath" on [[YouTube]].

[[nice try|Initial attempts]] to end the story with a [[suicide|self-inflicted headshot]] were made of .22 caliber lolgun and [[EFG|EPIC FAIL]], however, he later died when the tiny .22 slug eventually found its way to his pea-sized brain. Pekka also socialized with failures such as RockManKenny and Cyclopsis. 

As usual, [[stalker|the media]] was quick to play the Blame Game and went to the now familiar [[ebaums|4chan]] well of plentiful [[sauce]] where they found the obligatory: <big>'''"hey /b/, i'm gonna kill (x) today at (x) in the name of [[Anonymous]]"'''</big> post several hours after [[B|/b/tards]] had seen the news on TV.

As always, however, the only thing Anonymous can truly take credit for is turning [[death|that frown]] [[lulz|upside down]] and celebrating this event (and its eventual [[an Hero|hero]]) in [[B|/b/]]'s time-honored fashion of [[lulz]]y [[shoops]] to accompany the ensuing '[[flame|debate]]' with [[Eurofags]] whining about America's #1 export - the culture of gun awesome - and [[Americunts]] [[troll|returning fire]] with the usual "you're all pacifist pussies, lol."

==Media==
[[Image:Hero.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pussyhawks]]?]]
[[Image:Jokelahsmks2.png|right|thumb|]]
As usual [[old media]] is quick to blame everyone else but the shooter. 
What should we blame for the massacre:
* [[Rammstein]], who are also to blame for [[Columbine]] and the Beslan school hostage crisis.
* Music band Sturmgeist.
* Non-music band KMFDM.
* The ''Hitman'' video game.
* And of course [[4chan]] (people need to know what [[an hero]] means)

==Bible==
From The Holy Book of [[Raptor Jesus]]:

And Pekka-Eric looked down upon his classmates and took pity in their cries to kill the headmistress. Wailed his disciples, "Why, O Pekka-Eric have thee forsaken us?"

And Pekka-Eric said unto them, "My fellow classmates, you have not been forsaken. I have merely been fapping to FPS and Hitler."

"Have you forgotten about your people all the meanwhile? For our house hath been filled with both pop quizzes and homework!" spake the students.

"Nay, my minions! Fear not! For I shall send unto thee a new meme. A meme created of win, of awesome, and of God. And with this blessed meme I grant unto thee, ye shall be saved of the mutants and Jews!"

And thus, before the very eyes of the students, came their new meme.

The students did cower and grovel at the mightiness of this meme, and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth. Spake the students to Pekka-Eric, through their fear, "What name dost thou giveth to this glory, O sweet Pekka-Eric?"

And Pekka-Eric did grin as he said unto his followers, "LoL! For this creation, spawned from the pit of fail and faggotry, shall be known as HUMANITY IS OVERRATED!"
And there was much shooting.

==A Challenger appears==
At 9.23.2008, a Finnish 22-year old guy under the name <i>[[Mr. Saari|Wumpscut]]</i> went [[batshit insane]] and shot 9 students, his teacher and finally, himself (A NEW RECORD) at the institution of service of Kauhajoki. [[Some argue]] that he is the spirit of Pekka-Eric Auvinen himself, rising from his grave to [[pwn]] once more.
Not only did Wumpscut post videos of his mad shooting [[skillz]] to YouTube, but he also had imagery of himself (and his precious weapons) in IRC-Gallery.

== Another Challenger appears ==

We almost thought that the third part would never come this year to complete the trilogy, but at 31.12.2009 43-year old Arab shot 4 people in the Shopping Mall, [[Asked for it|his ex-girlfriend in her apartment]] and [[An hero|himself]]. [[Sarcasm|How original...]]

==Trivia==
*Known aliases: NaturalSelector89, Sturmgeist89
*''unconfirmed gamertag'' "Stray Bullet"
*[[Switch police on|Police]] found 69 empty shell cases at the Jokela School. That makes the hit rate: (10/69)*100 = 14.49%
*His IRL kill-death ratio is better than his [http://www.bf2player.com/index.php?page=stats&account=94933011 OL] ratio, although his pistol stats are ``Pistol	5:28:40	274	269	1.02	34%``
*Out of the 12 injured, only one was shot. [[Fail|The rest were injured during the evacuation.]]
*FINNISH HIM!
