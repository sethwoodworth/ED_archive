A serious affliction of our modern age.

== Diagnosis ==
As opposed to [[poor|IRL poverty]], which is a financial problem, the condition of being [[internet poor]] is a [[mental illness]].  While both result in symptoms of begging and complaining of hunger, people who are internet poor do it online instead of on a street corner.

People who are internet poor are not mentally capable of recognising that they are paying for the internet instead of buying food, clothes, or slushies.  This could be because they have [[midget|Leprechauns]] for an ISP, but is truthfully because they are rampagingly [[stupid]] and self-centered.

Online begging does actually happen, and sometimes a sexually attractive [[whore]] will ask for money from middle-aged businessmen, [[typical]]ly not [[fail]]ing in this.

== Digital Divide ==
The '''digital divide''' is a related phenomenon to internet poverty; it refers to the gap between those who are proficient in [[Web 2.0]] and those who have never used the internet at all. People who are on the wrong side of the digital divide regularly include the [[old]], [[poor]], [[retarded]], those living in third world countries and working class people who prefer the [[old media]] because they're thick as pigshit.
