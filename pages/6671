Psyke.org
[[Image:Nobodycares.jpg|thumb|yeah, pretty much]]
'''Psyke.org''' is a community of people who [[cut]] themselves. There are 8 sections to the website. The [[Shit nobody cares about|personal stories]], coping, [[Emo|poetry]], and articles sections are [[tl;dr]]. The [[Add to cart|bookstore link]] has never been clicked. 

The main thing that sets psyke.org apart from other self injury websites is that it has a massive database of self injury pictures submitted by their [[Camwhore|users]]. Photowhoring your  [http://www.psyke.org/pictures/w/willem/slides/willem_09.jpg skinny white faggot arms] is all the rage nowadays.

The forums provide almost as much [[lulz]] as the photos. Things to say at the forums:

*Wow, you suck at shaving
*I think scars are really sexy 
*Try harder, deeper next time
*Only fags write poetry
*Hey, check out [http://internet-srs.biz/ this link], it has some really good information about how to get people to take self-injury seriously


'Across the freeway' or any variation is an [[old meme]] in SI forums, so [[stfu]]. [[Unfunny|You aren't clever]] and that [[shit]] hasn't hurt anyone's feelings for [[at least 100 years]]. Same with calling everyone emo; it's been done more times than [[your mom]].
