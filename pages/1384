'''Cave Story''' is a freeware game made by the [[azn]], Daisuke "[[faggot|pixel]]" Amaya to appeal to all of the [[weaboo]] fangirls with totally kawaii anime-esque graphics. It completely ripped off games like Super Metroid, and [[Mario]]. Released in 2004 for the PC, it became a [[scientology|cult]] classic among [[Retarded|indie gamers]]. All of the game, yes, the shitty graphics, shitty music, shitty gameplay and shitty story, ALL of it was made by Pixel. The game was later [[sellout|ported to WiiWare]] so fanboys could buy the game instead of playing it for free.

When Pixel isn't busy fending off weaboo fans, he's fapping to [http://www.ganzor.com/images/rule%2034/Balrog%20Cave_Story.jpg the plethora] of Cave Story [[rule 34]]. There has been a considerably [http://www.fanfiction.net/game/Cave_Story/ large amount of fanfiction] written about Cave Story, which is somewhat amusing.

==[[The Game]]==
===Story===
You start out as an amnesiac robot who doesn't remember shit and apparently had too much to drink the night before. If you do some exploring, you steal some nigger's gun and somehow wander off into a village. The village is populared by mimigas, which are [[furry|human-like rabbits that can talk]]. The mimigas are [[butthurt]] because some [[faggot]] called The Doctor keeps kidnapping them, taking them to his lair, and raping them beyond recognition. The mimigas, after eating red flowers, turn [[batshit]] insane and kill everything. As it turns out, there is a mimiga named Sue who the [[unwarranted self importance|self important]] mimiga [[Narcissism|King]] doesn't like, because she's diff'rent. Later in the game, it's discovered that some bitch turned her into a mimiga for [[for the lulz|no reason]]. 

Eventually, shit happens, King dies, and one of the mimigas is kidnapped by Balrog. Balrog is a [[retarded|special]] lunchbox toaster briefcase or something who works for The Doctor alongside with some cumdumpster named Misery. You discover that The Doctor is capturing the mimigas because he wants to use them as his [[personal army]] to destroy the world. Just for the sake of destroying the world. Eventually, you meet some [[women|female]] robot named Curly Brace who is a completely useless character.

The doctor almost feeds the mimigas red flowers, until you blow shit up and [[Za Warudo|the floating island]] starts to fall. The "good ending" is where you save everyone and they live happily ever after (except the final boss), and you, Curly, and lunchbox fly off to the nearest sex hotel. teh edn.

===Wiiware port===
After it was ported to WiiWare, the reactions were mixed. It started [[fanboy]] wars of epic proportions, arguing over stupid details. After the company that ported it, Nicalis, changed the translation, fanboys all over got their [[BAW|panties in a bunch]]. Large arguments were started over Balrog (moar liek BalFAG [[amirite]]) having his catchphrase replaced with [[kool-aid|"OH YEAHHHHH"]] instead of "HUZZAH", <s>and Quote's hat being yellow instead of red</s> Quote's pallet changes according to what mode you play , with "original" being the same as on PC. Didn't stop the newfags who couldn't manage anything other then easy from bitching, though.

Aside from the reception, the port itself sucked as well. It's the same game, but much buggier and it had shittier music (if that's even possible), and overall seemed like a half-assed unfinished piece of shit. But, of course, the dedicated fanboys still wasted their money on it. It had a few extra (useless) modes like sanctuary speedrun, where you have to pick up your weapons and health every time you die (and listen to the "item get" music), a minor graphical edit that is Curly's mode, and the boss battle mode.
Later on, a patch was made that fixed the glitchy music and a few other stuff, and it was also released on DSi ware.
