Rangerphile
{{Watch}}

[[Image:Pedophilia.jpg|right|frame|Oh God, this can't end well.]]
'''Rangerphile''' is the term used to describe the [[Ray Jones|sick mess]] of a person that is best described as the unique combination of a [[furry]] and a [[Christfag]].

These people -- if they may be called that -- engage in a [[sick fuck|pathological sexual practice]] known as '''Rangerphilia''', which is somewhat like [[pedophile|pedophila]], but rather than being into children, Rangerphilia consists of [[List of sex moves|insatiable perversion]] directed at the characters from the shitty Disney cartoon series ''Chip n' Dale Rescue Rangers''.

This show, which was not nearly as good as its contemporaries, is actually something of [[facepalm|an embarrassment]] in the Disney canon (which is really fucking saying something), owing to the fact that it was just so Goddam awful. Many children who watched the show can't even remember anything about it, save for the theme song that was so soul-destroying with its annoyance it drove some adults [[an hero|to suicide]].

Much like pedophiles, Rangerphiles currently campaign for "Rangerphilia" to be a sexual orientation -- a very [[irony|strange thing]] to note, as Rangerphiles are virulently [[homophobic]]. This is in and of itself ironic, as ''Chip 'n Dale'' sounds more than a bit like "Chippendales" (the male strippers group). Rangerphiles are, therefore, gay by proxy.

Unbelievably, these same people are all practicing [[Christians]] -- or, rather, hypocritical morons that delight in taking the [[Bible]] and completely [[Fred Phelps|wrenching it out of context]]. This is all apparently to make up for the [[Blagogate|tremendous guilt]] they must doubtlessly feel for so ferociously [[rape|raping]] a shitty children's show.

The combination of being both [[Christfag]] and [[furfag]] has proven lethal, leaving Rangerphiles as a truly degenerate society of nauseating [[fucktard|fucktards]]. Representing the very worst of the [[Internet]], they deserve every last bit of [[shit]] thrown at them. 

==Why Rangerphiles Are So Pathetic==

Another Disney show that aired around the same time as ''Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers'', was ''[[win|DuckTales]]'', which was better animated, better written, and just an altogether better experience than the half-baked jalopy piece of shit that was ''Rescue Rangers''. It ran for two seasons ([[at least 100|exactly 100]] episodes) had an animated movie that was released in theaters, and is fondly remembered by many children for its catchy themesong and recognisable characters.

''Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers'', on the other hand, ran for [[fail|barely]] 65 episodes before being (mercifully) canceled, pretty much summing up what almost everyone, except the Rangerphiles, thought of the show -- with its insipid writing, atrocious voice-acting, and of course the [[pain series|please-God-make-it-stop]] themesong.

The show itself -- the characters, that damn themesong -- remained largely forgotten by the public at large (i.e., people who weren't [[batshit insane|fucked in the head]] like the Rangerphiles are), and would have thankfully remained that way, had not the evil of the Rangerphile pseudo-religion been spawned from a gigantic, puss-filled, maggoty pile of [[fail]].

Although many things have been subjected to the terror of [[Rule 34|The 34th Rule]], Rangerphiles have mercilessly raped a mediocre-at-best children's show and turned it into a nightmarish pile of [[pain series|indescribable horror]] with their astoundingly bad [[bullshit|"fan art"]] and [[fanfiction|"fanfiction"]].

==What They Worship==
[[Image:Rangerworshipplz2.jpg|left|frame|From left to right: Chip, Gadget, Jack, Zipper, and Dale. Keep in mind Rangerphiles want to [[fuck|bone]] (or be boned by) them all, more than they do [[IRL|real]] people.]]
*'''Chip''': The leader of the Rescue Rangers. Likes to cosplay as Indiana Jones. A gigantic bitch. Most Rangerphiles want to be fucked ''by'' him.

*'''Dale''': The other guy. Likes to cosplay as Quagmire from ''[[Family Guy]]''. Some Rangerphiles want to fuck him...but not many.

*'''Gadget Hackwrench''': Polymath mechanic, inventor, and pilot who is featured in all kinds of [[shitting dick nipples|endlessly clever sexual situations]] designed, drawn, and passionately wished for by the prototypical Rangerphile, [[Ray Jones]]. 

*'''Monterrey Jack''': Australian [[fat|fat-ass]] prone to having seizures and [[I came|spontaneous orgasm]] when he smells cheese. Only the original character that Ray Jones hideously spawned, "[[Mexican|Jalapena]]", will fuck him.

*'''Zipper''': A tiny green fly who no one likes, sucks as a character, and serves no purpose other than [[unfunny|comic relief]] from [[irony|what little comedy the show had]].

*'''Tammy''': Only featured in one episode. [[Jailbait]] squirrel who prefigures prominently in a wide variety of Rangerphile [[masturbation|masturbatory fantasies]].

*'''Foxglove''': <s>Also featured in only one episode.</s> Uhh, two episodes... A stupid and repulsively [[ugly]] bat who, despite her ugliness, is still well-beloved by the Rangerphile community. So much so that Rangerphiles everywhere cried themselves a river when [[Shit nobody cares about|the untalented dumbshit slutty cunt that voiced this character died.]] Well, it wasn't as bad as [[Avatar The Last Airbender|Avatards]] crying over the slant-eyed toker that voiced Iroh, or [[Pokemon]] [[fanboys]] crying over the ugly transvestite who voiced Meowth.

==The Rangerphile Demographic==

Rangerphilia is, quite again like pedophilia, found in a sickeningly wide array of people -- from the superficially normal to (of course) the [[Karl Rove|outright insane]]. Here's a quick rundown to better help identify these [[Tori Sue Heck|disgusting]] human beings, and to better educate the public as to just what these people stand for, and the inherent threat they pose.

===Facts At A Glance===

* Is a [[Furry|Furry]].
* Loves to Roleplay.
* [[insane|Christian]].
* Wants to fuck Gadget.
* Has or wants the most prized possession of this [[Sonic|fucktarded fanbase]]; A Ranger plush toy from 1992 (usually Gadget).
* Is a [[old|middle-aged]] male.
* Dumb as a post.
* Ugly as sin.
* As the result of above, tend to marry other AcornCafe.com members or remain [[basement dweller]]s all of their lives.
* Has an astonishing array of fetishes that nearly put [[Anonymous]] to shame: scat, urethral, piss, and so on.
* Fancies himself a [[Shitty_art|master fan-artist]].
* Hates gays to compensate for attraction to Chip (or Dale).
* Not just a fan, ''obsessed''.
* Loves to put [[Rule 34]] to ever more [[sick fuck|ingenious]] use by inventing new fetishes, such as melting lesbians.

====Age Group====

While substantial space could be provided to detail how old Rangerphiles tend to be, it's better to let a quote -- which needs to be typed out in full -- fully elucidate the average age of the typical Rangerphile, and really just what a Rangerphile truly is:

{{quote|As many are now aware, [[basement dweller|I'm 39 years old]] and going strong. We have a very diverse age range here at the Cafe, and I've never felt that age per se was the telling factor of who was a Rangerphile. I was 20 when RR came out, so it's been with me nearly half my life now.

[[shit nobody cares about|My sophomore year at college was a lonely one, and the Rangers helped make it feel less so.]] I was big into the Indiana Jones merchandise collecting then, and Chip was who appealed to me first with that outfit. [[Ray Jones|Then I noticed Gadget and had the requisite crush on her for a while.]] Neither of those things was why I came to the fandom, though--it was a love for the show, the funny bits, the great use of character, etc.

I've always loved good stories, and they start with good characters. I have a lot of my own creative spark that I owe to writing RR fanfiction, which is why I try to write at least one a year to keep that going. [[Dying_alone|I'll probably be writing them forty years from now.]]|Dr. Indy, with emphasis added on the really revealing parts.}}

==The Acorn Cafe==

[[Image:Oily.jpg|right|frame|Hot damn, look at them mouse tits!]]
Rangerphiles huddle together in a filthy warren called the Acorn Cafe, perhaps the singlemost loathsome forum next to [[SomethingAwful]].
 
Everyone there has [[no life]]. Before you even make your first post, they will start a thread welcoming you, because they are so repulsive that they hope that someone, ''anyone'', will accept them. 

They will tell you about their [[nobody gives a shit|hopes and dreams]] and how much they want to fuck Gadget or Chip. It is disturbingly pathetic that these people lurk around this lame forum so much that they notice a new member signing in and leap at the chance to welcome them and rant about themselves, all before the [[n00b]] even makes their first post. Should a female decide to join the party, she'll promptly receive [[rape|a warm welcome]].

===The Culprits===

*'''Ray Jones''': Mod and Almighty God-Emperor. [[Ray Jones|Loves Gadget]], to a shocking, almost unbelievable degree.

===Don't Ask, Don't Tell===

If there is anything that Rangerphiles hate more than [[Anonymous]], it's [[homosexuality]]. Claiming that [[lie|they want to keep everything G-rated]], the mods banned anything having to do with the subject, including [[Rule 34]], fapfiction, and any discussions unless it had anything to do with burning in hell for being a [[faggot|fannybandit]]. 

Much lulz ensued when one Rangerphile by the name of Soda came out of the closet and begged the entire forum to [[goatse|fuck him in the ass]]. The mods of the forum [[goggles|tore out their eyes]] in self-righteous horror and immediately banned him, claiming that they wanted to prevent any "flaming" both [[homosexuality|literally]] and [[troll|figuratively]].

On another occasion, one of the mods outed himself as a homophobe without even realizing it. Major butthurt ensued:

{{quote|"The rule against [[thoughts on yaoi|homosexual discussion]] also stems from [[Completely_irrelevant_history|past arguments on the subject]], which became quite heated. It's obvious that opinions on the matter are [[flame wars|strong on both sides]]. However, the Cafe still holds to a certain moral standard that believes that homosexuality is wrong, and therefore it isn't tolerated in stories, art, or general discussion. That's why the topic is banned, because it's such a sensitive and divisive issue to many people, and there are those who would try to use any excuse they could to force it upon everyone else."|Framwinkle}}

Further evidence was found on his blog. He starts out with the typical excuse as to why homosexuality isn't allowed at the Acorn Cafe:

{{quote|"Why can't [[trolls|these people]] just get it through their heads that it's not an acceptable topic there, and leave it at that? Why do they insist on trying to shove it in our faces? I don't care what they talk about elsewhere, and there are places where that sort of thing is not only acceptable, but encouraged. But if they're going to be at the Cafe, they're going to have to live by certain guidelines. It's supposed to be a family friendly place. Not that we would agree on the definition of family, either. Sigh."|Framwinkle}}

But then he goes into a rant that would make [[Fred Phelps]] want to become a Rangerphile:

{{quote|"One thing they like to point to is a story someone wrote about the issue, in which an overbearing Hitler-ite squirrel tries to banish strawberry cakes from a celebration. Basically, it tries to equate homosexuality as being no different than a different flavor of [[cake]], which makes perfect sense if you don't believe that there's anything wrong with homosexuality. After all, that's just a different kind of sex, right? How absurd. Following that line of reasoning, murder could be just another form of sport hunting. Where do you draw the line?

But the line is drawn. Not by man, who only has his reason, and could thereby justify anything. The line is drawn by [[God]], through the [[fanfiction|scriptures]], as well as through our conscience. It's this that people can't stand, because to accept that something is wrong they have to accept God, and that brings about a bunch of other things that are also wrong. No, it's much easier to believe that the world is just a big gray area.

Homosexuality is a very destructive lifestyle, both physically and spiritually. It's like asking, "Should we go back and adapt to slavery?" Who in their right mind would agree to it? The things listed were improvements to society, for the most part. That's not to say that they can't have their disadvantages, but over all they're good things. What has to be understood and accepted is that homosexuality is not a good thing. I don't doubt that our society will adapt to homosexuality and homosexual marriage. But it's not going to help us become a better people."|Framwinkle}}

This is all very ironic since Rangerphiles themselves want Chip to [[buttsecks|ram them in the ass]].

===Further Irony===

Exodus 22:19 states that [[justice|"Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death."]] Rangerphiles ignore this, since they are too full of failure and shit to study what they preach.

===Prayer Requests===

One of the most common topics at the Acorn Cafe is the prayer request, of which there are [[Over 9000|countless thousands]], with more coming everyday. A Rangerphile will create one of these topics [[Attention whore|purely for attention]]. The resulting thread is a gigantic [[Bukkake|circle jerk]] of fail and Gadget rape. A typical prayer request is a reliable source of much [[lulz]]:

{{quote|"I ask because my mother has to report in for a [[Goatse|colonoscopy]], tomorrow. [[Rape|It's a thoroughly unpleasant experience]] from what I know of it, and [[Incontinent Student Bodies|she's more than a little upset over having to have it done]]."|RangerReady23}}

{{quote|"As of this past weekend I no longer have a computer. Though it was [[old media|only two years old and brought brand new]] it died on me. If I want to remain online at all I'll have to buy a new computer, which I absolutely did not need to deal with at this time, but that's how it's turned out. In fact, [[Fat|I'll probably have to do a bit of belt tightening]] if I pull it off at all.

Until further notice please send me no e-mails or PM's as I won't be in a position to read them. Please keep me in your thoughts and prayers. I know I don't hang out here very much any more, but I'll miss you just the same.

[[No life|The saddest thing about this whole business is that my videos, music, and documents (including fan fics) are stuck on the motherboard of the old computer where they can't be accessed]]. Maybe one day [[Fucktard|I'll learn the importance of backing up things.]]"|Enduring Man-Child}}

{{quote|"don't forget... your local library's not a bad place for [[Cybersex|free 15 mins-hour of internet.]] Just remember to [[masturbation|wash your hands]]afterwards!"|pupspals}}

The other Rangerphiles will then clasp hands, which they call "paws" because they are delusional [[Christian furry|furries that claim to be Christian]], and pray together. Since [[Jesus Christ]] hates Rangerphiles and never answers them, they are left [[butthurt|deeply upset]] and confused.

===Drama Between Forums===

[[Image:Ex-Mousefucker.jpg|thumb|right|Well I'll be a son of a bitch.]]
The Ranger(pedo)philes frequently claim to be the only forum full of furfags obsessed with the Rescue Rangers. When another site, Chip 'n' Dale Online, was created and claimed sole fapping rights, not to mention had an extensive section about the pre-Ranger Chip and Dale cartoons which are actually good, much drama ensued. The Rangerphiles bawwwed and immediately hid their Gadget porn. Lulz was had when they found out that a user at Chip 'n' Dale Online was a known [[/b/tard]]. The Rangerphiles completely shit themselves. They accused Chip 'n' Dale Online of being full of "[[anonymous|channers]]." When [[Ray Jones]] announced that [[Bullshit|he was going to stop drawing Rule 34]], there was a major eruption of butthurt. Now without Gadget pron, the Rangerphiles blamed Chip 'n' Dale Online and continued to believe that they were a part of [[anonymous]].

When it seemed like all the drama had finally died down, a user from Chip 'n' Dale Online edited the Acorn Cafe article on a fandom wiki, [[Truth|stating that the Rangerphiles were a bunch of Christ-loving homophobes who wanted to both rape Gadget and have Chip fondle their assholes]]. As expected, massive amounts of butthurt followed. The Rangerphiles cried that it was an act of [[vandalism]]. Some went even as far as tracking the user's IP address so they could locate him and [[rape|punish him accordingly]]. This failed miserably and the Rangerphiles went back to reading [[Ray Jones|Cheer Up Gadget]] to [[Masturbation|make themselves feel better]].
While Chip 'n' Dale Online itself is no better than the Acorn Cafe as it claims to be, major lulz ensues whenever the site is proclaimed as being superior to the Acorn Cafe. Spamming the Acorn Cafe with pro Chip 'n' Dale Online banners will result in instant deletion. Some Rangerphiles will even go into a tirade about how [[Internet is Serious Business|the Acorn Cafe has been around for ten years]], exposing themselves yet again as the obsessive sick fucks that they are.

*[http://www.theacorncafe.org/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=20321 The Acorn Cafe has gots officials!]

*[http://www.fanhistory.com/index.php/Talk:Rescue_Rangers Oh golly, vandalism on my Internets?!]

*[http://chipndaleonline.com/forums/ Chip 'n' Dale Online, filled with butthurt Rangerphiles and other furfags.]

===R.A.G.E===

[[Image:Gadgetno.jpg|thumb|left|...and yet she's still topless in the picture.]]
In an attempt to cover up their sick and twisted obsession over Gadget, the Rangerphiles created a group called '''R.A.G.E''', short for '''Rangerphiles Against Gadget Erotica'''. This group is full of failure and its page includes such retarded and lulzy statements as:

*Pornography as a whole [[Wetlook|demeans women]], objectifying them.
*Gadget herself would be against her naked body being plastered all over the Internet.
*Giving Gadget the body parts of a human while her male companions are free to go pantless without scandal is an [[Sarah Palin|unfair double standard]].
*We hate to see our caring, kind, brilliant Gadget turned into image meant solely to [[boner|arouse]] people. [[bullshit|She is much more than just a body]].

The Rangerphiles aren't fooling anyone. They want to fap to Gadget and will willingly give Ray Jones a blumpkin for some [[Rule34|Rule 34]]. Furthermore, it just goes to show just how delusional and sick these people are if they honestly try to [[Ad hominem|take into consideration the opinion of a cartoon character who's not even real]].

As for the Rangerphile opinion on the matter:

{{quote|"If you don't like it, don't look at it, and don't judge others who happen to do like it."|Syaoran_2001}}

{{quote|"Same goes for Nazis, Syaoran?"|Sinclair, bringing [[Godwin's Law|Godwin's]] into a debate about sweet anthropomorphic toon mouse bootie}}

Note: It is very lulzy when a group of people form an organization to troll themselves.

===The Golden Acorn Awards===

Every year, the Rangerphiles have an awards ceremony, an [[Purity Ball|extravaganza]] of self-indulgent [[fail]] that was purposely started to make themselves feel better about their collectively pathetic existence. This "awards show" is made up of roleplaying where all the Rangerphiles present take turns fucking Gadget, give out awards that nobody gives a shit about, and fuck Gadget some more. When that's done, they repeat it all, only this time letting Chip fuck ''them''.

The categories for this "awards show" business consist of crappy fanfiction and shitty artwork. Every award always go to Ray Jones since he's the Rangerphile God. The ceremony always ends with a [[lulz|lulzy]] rendition of the show's theme song and a communal bath in the blood of the children whose [[Rule 34|childhood they destroyed]].

Some of the "awards" include:

* Shittiest Story
* Worst Author
* Best use of Rule 34 involving Gadget 
* Lifetime faggotry Award
* Best use of Rule 34 involving Chip
* Best Nutcase (Who's the biggest sick fuck)

When a Rangerphile wins one of these [[Bullshit|prestigious]] awards, they will unfailingly shit their pants with ecstasy and actually write out an acceptance speech...for a [[epic fail|fake award that no one else on the planet has ever heard of]]. The actual content of the aforementioned acceptance speeches generally go something like this:

{{quote|Crikey. And I don't use that word often! Thanks so much, gang. These awards mean a lot to me. [[No life|An awful lot]]. And I know this one means a lot to somebody else, too. Give a big hand for the one who really won it...[[Mary Sue|Reguba, son of Reguba]], squirrel warrior supreme! Take a bow, big guy! In addition to that...even though he'll probably never read about these awards, I'd like to thank the indomitable [[closet furry|Mr. Brian Jacques]], for creating the [[shit nobody cares about|sparkling, lively world that we call Redwall.]] It's an ongoing story like no other, and it's done worlds of [[AIDS|contributing to my own.]] Thank you, sir! [[LOL WUT|Hurr, et be a gurt h'onor, burr aye!]]|RangerReady23}}

====The Kind of Bullshit That Wins These Awards====

The story being referenced (featuring RangerReady23's favourite [[zeta toy|yiffy sex toy]] "Reguba"), can be found [http://rrdatabase.dyndns.org/written/charlie_price/cdrr_generations_6.html here]. In the story, Chip has married and (very promptly) [[pregnant|knocked up]] Gadget...and then some yiff-fuck named Reguba shows up. Or something. Anyway it's total [[crap]] but it won wild praise, which gives some idea of how Rangerphiles reward each other's [[fail|"efforts"]], despite the fact that everytime one of them writes a [[fanfiction|"fanfic"]] it inevitably finishes as something [[My Immortal|excruciatingly terrible]].

This is from what won that Golden Acorn Award that RangerReady23 was [[I came|emptying his balls all over the room]] for:

{{quote|“Come, [[furry|fell beasts]]! Come, and meet your doom at the hands of [[Mary Sue|Reguba, son of Reguba]], warrior of the squirrelclan of Essex!”


The cats, seemingly impressed by this display, moved in. Reguba [[goatse|tore into them]] like a whirling [[muslim|dervish]], his [[cock|staff]] flashing in an arc of silver light, ripping circuitry and hull-metal wherever it struck, driven by his [[OH GOD BILL|incredible strength]]. Looking on from his own escape, Monty’s ingrained punchiness took over.


[[LOL WUT|“Strike me starkers]], oi’ve [[Jam It In|got ta get inta that!”]]|''Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers: Generations'', Chapter VI, by RangerReady23}}

You just can't make this crap up.

[[Image:ACNY.jpg|right|frame|Mousefuckers mean [[serious business|serious fucking business]].]]
When they found out about this article, the Rangerphiles became extremely [[butthurt]]. Some [[Internet Court|threatened to sue for defamation and slander]] while one Rangerphile by the name of [[User:Steve|Racebest]] went as far as creating an account on ED just so that he could blank the article. Epic failure ensued and he went crying back to [[Ray Jones|Grandpa Ray]] for some Gadget pron. The Rangerphiles continued to bawww before going back to fapping to [[Rule 34]] when they realized that they're sick [[pedophiles]] regardless.

==Enemies of the Lulz==

Most Rangerphiles are just sick fucks who want to have sex with mice and underage squirrels. Surprisingly, there are some Rangerfags who are much worse than the rest. These particular Rangerphiles are well known for their faggotry, noted for being absolute sick fucks like [[Ray Jones]] or complete douchebags.

===Gay Bennet===

An absolute fuckstain who fails miserably at life. Like all Rangerfags, Gay Bennet discovered this article and shit bricks. But not content with bawwwing and going back to jacking off to Gadget [[scat]] like the rest of the rangerphiles, Gay Bennet tried to take matters into his own sticky, cum filled hands. Creating over 9000 [[sockpuppet]] accounts, Gay Bennet constantly spammed the page with failed results. And every time a couple EDiots reverted the page, which Gay Bennet was too [[retarded]] to realize, they proceeded to remind him of his faggotry. Butthurt, Gay Bennet spammed their userpages and claimed victory. Yet again, a [[fucktard]] like Gay Bennet failed to realize that anything that's vandalized can be reverted instantly. And every time he vandalized the rangerphile page or an EDiot's userpage, he was immediately raped by the banhammer. Unsatisfied with his repeated failures, the EDiots plastered his userpages with Gadget porn, which were usually from the sickening works of [[Ray Jones]]. Gay Bennet also claims that his real name is [[lie|Gabe Bennet]] and that [[anonymous]] is just making fun of him. But his name is, in fact, Gay Bennet. He also raped his pet rat to death. This is also a fact.

==Gallery of Shame==
Like any obsessed fan of a bunch of rabid mice would do, Rangerphiles enjoy showing off their amazing art skills through [[fanart]]. However, because Rangerphiles are sick, twisted individuals, they feel the need to undress these small rodents and portray them acting out their sick fetishes. Truly disgusting.
