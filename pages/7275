{{lj|Scathachqme}} was a member in good standing of [[CF Hardcore]], one of its more prolific and rabidly anti-child members. Like most in that community, she filled her posts and comments with ravings against "moos," "crotchdroppings," and "breeders," because this made her cool. Unlike most, though, she had... a dark secret.

==The exposure==
{{lj|bsdetector93}}, creator of parody comm {{ljcomm|childfree_bs}}, had long stalked members of the CF community and observed their habits. A Google search of Scathachqme's username led him to an RPG forum userpage, where "Scathach" expressed interest in D&D, Shadowrun, White Wolf games, and parenting.

BSDetector posted his discovery to {{ljcomm|parent_drama}} and [[pop parenting]] anonymous bitchfest site [[LJ User Secrets]], where the regulars of the {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} IRC channel found it. {{lj|cabbitobsessed}} promptly posted it to {{ljcomm|cf_hardcore}} while pretending not to do it for the lulz.

[http://community.livejournal.com/cf_hardcore/3756611.html Golly gee, you guys, what do you think of this?]

Epic lulz ensued as the hardcore childfree screamed bloody murder at the betrayal in their midst, while the bored moms and mom-haters at LJUS celebrated the arrival of an actual interesting secret, instead of the usual "you're a dirty ho" posts. 

==Scathach defends herself==
Scathach appeared and reported everybody who commented to [[LJ Abuse]], as well as reporting LJUS even though they're not part of the LJ system, for "netstalking." They were being horrid and unreasonable, she said, because the children pictured were her niece and nephew, and she could prove she was right by [http://community.livejournal.com/cf_hardcore/3756611.html?thread=75698243#t75698243 swearing more than anybody else.]

[http://community.livejournal.com/cf_hardcore/3756611.html?thread=75691587#t75691587 They're my sister's kids! How dare you insult my sister's kids in a kid-insulting community??]

[http://community.livejournal.com/cf_hardcore/3756611.html?thread=75693891#t75693891 You see, we both use the same username.]

[http://community.livejournal.com/cf_hardcore/3756611.html?thread=75694915#t75694915 And we make MySpaces for each other, except sometimes we get the information wrong and accidentally post pictures of ourselves instead.]

[http://community.livejournal.com/cf_hardcore/3656217.html?thread=73147929#t73147929 Also, it's just a coincidence that the boy looks mixed and I dated a black man about, oh, nine months before he was born.]

Looks like she deleted her comments, but her journal is still up. And we have screencaps!

Prior to this incident, Scathach was banned from {{ljcomm|cf_debate}} for [http://community.livejournal.com/cf_debate/221891.html?thread=11022275#t11022275 breaking] the [http://community.livejournal.com/cf_debate/245580.html?thread=11843916#t11843916 rules] and arguing with the mods about it. Accordingly, she blamed her outing on the mod who banned her, {{lj|karnythia}}. After all, they'd had one argument [http://community.livejournal.com/evil_trepannys/26881.html?thread=460801#t460801 a year and a half ago], and then she got banned for NO REASON AT ALL, so clearly Karnythia the Evil Black Lady was out to persecute her innocent honky ass.

Scathach changed the copy of her "sister's" picture (which was on her sister's server, to which she apparently has full access) to a graphic accusing Karnythia of posting anonymously to create wank, but she spelled "Karnythia" wrong. And "wank." Since Karnythia is a known [[comment whore]] who crossposts all over LiveJournal [[snark]] communities calling people racist or stupid under her own name, [http://community.livejournal.com/cf_hardcore/3756611.html?thread=75692611#t75692611 nobody bought that one.]

After Scathach threatened to burn everybody's houses down for making fun of her <strike>sister's</strike> kids, {{lj|teegeeack}} [http://community.livejournal.com/cf_hardcore/3756611.html?thread=75710531#t75710531 summed it all up]:

{{quote|It's different when it's your own, huh?|Teegeeack, winning}}

At present, Scathach has several lolsuits pending against members of LJUS and {{ljcomm|cf_hardcore}}, while the mess has been posted to {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} AND {{ljcomm|stupid_free}}. The moderator of {{ljcomm|cf_hardcore}} issued a call for [http://community.livejournal.com/cf_hardcore/3756611.html?thread=75697987#t75697987 evidence], but unfortunately, Scathach found herself incapable of restraint on either {{ljcomm|cf_hardcore}} or the Special Evidence Community. In the end, the mod told her to [http://community.livejournal.com/cf_hardcore/3756611.html?thread=75721539#t75721539 STFU] and [http://community.livejournal.com/cf_hardcore/3756611.html?thread=75749699#t75749699 GTFO].

==Proof?==
The really hilarious part is that, shortly before she was banned, Scathach posted several pictures that appear to prove her version of events. Of course, that was also shortly before she threw a gigantic fit and deleted all of her comments, thereby erasing the evidence of her innocence. Anyway she'd gotten so fucking srs about the whole thing that people still didn't believe her.
