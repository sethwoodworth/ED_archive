'''Fark.com (1999-2007)''' was a news and "humor" site with famous [[Photoshop]] competitions.  Fark is perhaps more famous for stealing [[meme]]s from other web sites and claiming them as their own.  Fark died on April 25th, [[2007]] with the introduction of the worst site redesign in internet [[history]]; its role was subsequently assumed by the upstart [[BanniNation|banniNation.com]].

The format of Fark was: registered users are invited to submit weird news stories to the site in the hopes of getting the "[[green]]light".  Approved articles ended up on the Main Page (or the tabs, which [[no one cares]] about), and the submitter got to feel a little [[unwarranted self-importance]]. The vast majority of "user-submitted" articles are actually pre-approved from a list compiled that day by Fark's editors (Drew and his unpaid interns). Think of it as writing a letter to the editor: would a newspaper print your letter? No they wouldn't. Fuck off.

Fark became less and less a source of wacky news stories and moved mainstream, and on [[JEWS DID WTC|September 11th, 2001]] they switched formats completely and only supplied breaking news coverage of the attacks.  The next day, though, they switched back to the normal fart jokes and [[tits|Boobies links]].

Fark wants to make [[you]] feel it's a place to go to and appear intellectual by chatting about current events, when you really want to defend [[pedophiles]], [[Poeticirony|dog fucking]], [[communism]], [[drug]] use, or perfectly reasonable religions like the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_SubGenius Church of the SubGenius], all while insisting [[Christians]] are crazy and the epitome of what is wrong with the world.

Drew made a study of the media, and eventually wrote a book [[anal|blasting]] the media for trying to make money by printing tabloids full of bullshit of no consequence. No one really knows if he finds Fark's successful application of everything he apparently loathes about the media amusing, horrifying, or simply a great way to do even less journalism than tabloids do and still manage to rake in the cash.

==Forums==

[[Image:Farksux.jpg|thumb|350px|Loli cheerleaders hate teh Fark.]]

If the [[IMDb message boards|IMDb forums]] are where your brain goes to die, the Fark Forums are [[Hell]].  Every other comment is an [[old meme]] that probably originated at Something Awful or [[4chan]] which the bastards self-referentially refer to as "Fark Cliches".  The list of known stolen Cliches includes:
*Oolong
*[[Limecat]]
*Ackbar/It's a trap!
*Every other [[image macro]] evar
*[[Your mom]]
The only "cliche" that is known to have originated in the Fark Forums is [[Magua]].  And while they didn't technically create the phrase [[UFIA|Unsolicited Finger in the Anus]], they are wholly responsible for popularizing it.

An especially popular forum topic is wild speculation over whether various attractive people are [[anorexic]], and whether "eating a sandwich" would cure the affliction. This classic battle pits [[fat]] [[girl]]s and the men who love them against [[everyone]] else.

In order to keep things [[shit|fresh]] at Fark, '''every''' news article title ends with the phrase "hilarity ensues" because it's so incredibly funny and random!

==Hierarchy==
===Drew===
Drew Curtis is in charge of Fark (kind of like [[User:Girlvinyl|GV]] for us or [[Your Mom]] for [[you]]).  That's why the title of every page says "Drew Curtis Presents: Drew Curtis' FARK.com (A Drew Curtis Production)". Drew is an fat scary alcoholic homosexual who loves teh shota porn.

===[[Admins]]===
These are the people who pick the links.
===Moderators===
These are <s>the people who wade through the [[crap]] and [[ban]] people for their [[faggotry]]</s> the most incompetent members of Fark.  [[Noone]] understands this, though, and people are always running and [[bitch]]ing to the Mods about how their [[unfunny]] links weren't picked for the Main Page. 
They are commonly found getting their ePenis sucked by TotalFarkers.

===TotalFarkers===
The site is noted for its large collection of idiots called '''TotalFarkers''', who pay $5 a month to have their special main page of Fark spammed with all the thousands of crappy articles that don't get posted because they suck that much.  The only redeeming qualities for paying for Fark are the direct access to the [[at least 100|hundreds]] of Boobies links submitted every day and the sense of e-friendship they feel when they [[gang rape]] a [[retard]] for submitting something [[stupid]].

===Farkers===
Called "liters" (pronounced ''lighters'') by everyone else, these people are the bottom of the barrel.  The one good thing about them is their willingness to be [[troll]]ed.  Other than that, trying to talk to them is like trying to explain to [[User:Zen444|Zen444]] how wikis work.  Some good trolling subjects include: [[abortion]], [[circumcision]], [[W]]'s effectiveness as a leader in the 21st Century, and [[Furries]].

==== Notable Farkers ====
Besides Curtis, several well known people have been known to hang out on Fark, including Wesley Crusher and (allegedly) that guy from that one episode of Full House. Also this one time Christopher Walken was in Starbucks and he almost looked at a laptop that was showing Fark. But he didn't.

==== Non-Notable Farkers ====
However, Fark is 99.9999999% composed of complete nobodies, including
*antinorm
*bubbaprog
*buttercup
*gbrudy16
*sluggard
*stevedave

Note: The astute reader will see that above hierarchy is startlingly similar to [[Paid Account|how LiveJournal distributes it's power]] (and thus [[Unwarranted_self-importance|unwarranted self-importance]]).

===Drama-Generating Techniques===
You can [[troll]] Fark in the following ways:
*Suggest that Bobby Flay is more important than Alton Brown.
*Insist Salma Hayek is unfuckably ugly.
*Post fictitious comments on how you were banned for doing something similar to a previous post (since discussing bans in any context is in and of itself bannable conduct).
*Mention (without links) any shock meme not already mentioned in the FArQ and wait for someone to Google it.
*Post the most [[MONGO|cro-magnon]] [[retarded]] [[Amirite]]-baiting political headline imaginable with either the Hero or Obvious tag. When it fails to get greenlighted, resubmit it once an hour using different news sources.
*Mention the word [[Macintosh]] in a headline. Admins afraid of offending [[Jews|Mac users]] will automatically greenlight it hoping for a penis fight.
*Purchase a TF account with the name 'Smackbottom' in it.
*Piss off the [[Basement_dweller|official cafe thread submitters]] by beating them to the submission with a headline like 'I just crapped out a bloody NIGHT CREW', preferably an hour too early, and wait for the hall monitors to get all pissy.
*Post a parody headline and wait for an admin to ban you regardless of this being not a banworthy offense according to the TOS.

==Drew decides to change the layout and anally invade its users==

[[Image:Farkfuckt2.jpg|thumb|Fuckt layout but also fuckt upload, whats wrong with the ED upload?]]
On 26-4-2007, [[nevar forget]], in an attempt to give a big fuck you to all the users (including the totalfark users) they decided to change the layout completely, <strike>start randomly [[baleet]]ing posts, [[ban]]ning and/or [[shadowban]]ning users, and generallly being a bunch of pillow-biting nancies</strike>. ''(n.b. This is not true and uninteresting and [[citation needed]] and personal experience is original research and no one wants to hear about it you [[fgt]] trolls so stop talking about it or I'll ban you. Source: [[Wikipedia]]'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fark.com&diff=215016936&oldid=212581035]'')''. 

In the same trend as [[Something awful]] the layout looks all [[fuck]]ed now and the site is screwed beyond repair.

It generated lots of drama amongst the Fark users.  On the other hand, [[sellout|the Fark powers that be]] are probably getting more dough from the advertisers, who "don't like [[lulz|that crap]]".

It also spawned the creation of a few [[abortion|attempts at replacements]] which try to be like Fark except not all [[douche]]y, but so far [[teh]] [[winnar]] seems to be [[banniNation]], where many of the [[hero|pillars of the former Fark community]] go once they get sick enough of all the [[shit]] going on at Fark.

All this [[drama]] has also engendered some further drama at [[wikipedia|a certain Wiki site we all know and love]].

==OMG [[Hack]]ed==
One day, someone tried to hack Fark after completing all the coursework for [[Computer Science III]].  [[Fox News]] "new media manager" Darrell Phillips [http://mediaverse-memphis.blogspot.com/2007/08/on-getting-farked-999-percent.html], of Fox13 Memphis, is believed to have sent links to [[warez|malicious software]] to Fark Admins and Moderators in an attempt to learn their [[password]]s and gain access to the Fark source code.

At present Fark has subpoenaed some ISPs but has not brought a [[lawsuit]] against Fox13.  This can only mean that the admins are going for [[gang rape|vigilante justice]].

"Technology Gossip Blog" [http://valleywag.com/tech/darrell-phillips/ Valleywag] has a complete timeline of the events.

==[[Pwn]]ing Words==
The site still continuing in [[Zombie|a vegetative state]], Drew Curtis showed his total [[fucktard|greed]] in late 2007 by claiming that he pwns the abbreviation [[NSFW]]. The US Patents and Trademarks Office has it [http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=77342191 under consideration]. [[Fail]] and [[H8|hatred]] ensue.

'''As a swear''',this word is always used by some [[nerd|nerdy]] [[noob|n00btards]] who cant just say the word [[fuck]] all the time,and they cannot be [[an hero]] when they said the word ''fuck''
