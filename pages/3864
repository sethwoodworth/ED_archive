IMHO
'''IMHO''' is an [[acronym]] for "In My Humble(/Honest?) [[Opinion]]," which is [[ironic]] since any use of the term indicates that a statement is undeniable [[truth]], and that anyone that disagrees is either [[insane]], a [[fucktard]], or [[Why_do_you_hate_America%3F|hates America]].  In fact, they may well be a [[bureaucratic fuck]]. It is extremely [[condescension|condescending]]. Pronounced "Im-Ho," or possibly "I'm a ho."  Since everything said on the [[internets]] (even [[facts]]) is opinion, IMHO is completely redundant and should never be used. [[EVAR|Evar]].

This total [[faggotry]] [[lulz]] [[acronym]] should only [[evar]] be used if insulting someone else.

Example : Your a butt fucking idiot who should be shot dead, [[IMHO]]. Thus using this totally [[gay]] acronym and making someone else feel bad = [[win]].
