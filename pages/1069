Bob Frantz
Bob Frantz is another [[batshit insane|well-balanced talk show host]] along the likes of [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Sean Hannity]].  Unlike these two, however, he believes that being from [[ghetto|Cleveland]] makes him the czar of all knowledge.  He claims to be an independent, though his opinions are often [[pedophile|Republican-leading]]

Like any [[basement dweller|person interested in the realm of politics]], Frantz spends a lot of his time talking about shit [[noone]] cares about.  For example, in one post, he claims that [http://frantzrantz.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/10/on_confused_pro.html poor, innocent, unable to think children are being influenced by a suburb's radical gay agenda], but in the same breath claim that [http://frantzrantz.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/10/free_speech_vs_.html they are nothing but evil little devils who want to troll teachers on Myspace].  Pointing out this inaccuracy leads to him [http://frantzrantz.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/10/free_speech_vs_.html#comment-24610816 trolling you].
