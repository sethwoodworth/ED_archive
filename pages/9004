Traditionally, a '''Whore''' is a chick who exchanges sex for money, unlike a slut who gives it up for free. However, as the word evolved, a "''whore''" now more commonly means any insult a teenage girl can make. Other uses are [[Wikipedia:Succubus|Succubi]].

Once upon a time, whores used to be relatively rare in the [[United States|Western World]]. Now, thanks to 3rd wave [[feminism]], every second girl drinks [[cum]] for breakfast, an impressive feat given they'll now fuck only [[porn]] stars, the [[rich and beautiful|richest]] 10%, and [[dyke|each other]].

==Categories==
Whores can generally be categorized into one of the following subtypes:
#[[Attention whore|Attention]]
#[[Camwhore|Cam]]

#[[Comment whore|Comment]]
#[[Crackwhore|Crack]]
#[[Drama whore|Drama]]
#[[Fat whore|Fat]]
#[[Don Imus|Nappy Headed]]
#[[Prostatot]]
#[[Prostitute]]
#[[Scenewhore|Scene]]
#[[Skank]]
#[[Skeezer]]
#[[Your Mom]]
#[[You]]

== What Makes [[Your Mom]] a Whore? ==

All the above strains of whore have one thing in common: They will judge [[you]] exclusively by two things:

1. Your [[Bill Gates|monetary capital]] ("[[rich and beautiful|I want a man who can provide for me."]])

2. Your social circle ("I want a man who can [[rape|take]] me [[pooper|places]].")

Should you fail either of these requirements at any time in your relationship, you will find your children missing, your accounts frozen, and yourself served with a restraining order for physical abuse suffered during an especially voracious round of kinky sex with her [[Cooldude|man]] who actually meets her "[[cock|needs]]" as a woman. Much like her humanity, these needs are questionable given she lost all sensation down there sometime between her third [[abortion|babyectomy]] and when her pussy distended into a gaping tuna maw.

As you are having a three-way between a [[police|daddy-surrogate]] and a squad car during a preemptive arrest in your front yard, take comfort that she and her steroid-abusing, sweaty boyfriend will be doing all the things in that bed that she would never dream of letting you doing, and all of the things that she used to let you do but was "too tired," in your king-sized bed she nagged you into buying complete with matching throw-pillows and silken covers, if you listen closely, you might hear him howling in ecstasy as he digs his chipped, chalky nails into her silicone ass.

Surely she could not have an irrational hatred of the very "[[feminism|emotional cripples]]" whom enable her [[crabs|parasitic]] lifestyle.

If you think she'd have the decency to retire to her [[segregation|separate]] "bedrym" - also the largest - for this endeavor, you're [[doing it wrong|missing the pattern]].

But hey, while she was watching reruns of Sex and the City, reading cheesy romance novels, or texting her "real man," you kinda, sorta had disjointed, unemotional sex!

== [[Bukkake|Cockeyed?]] ==

Back-stabbing harpies who are proud of their "[[lies|virginity]]" and "saving it for [[marriage]]" are often the biggest gold-digging sluts of all, while women who have sex because [[feels good man|it's fucking awesome]] are the cleanest chicks on the block. This is because:

*For a whore to be a whore, some form of social or monetary capital must be exchanged

*A woman who has sex only wants pleasure, not marriage or monogamy

*Hence, a woman who is saving it for marriage is commercializing her vagina. Surprisingly, cock-trapping "good girls" are indeed whores.

Of course, sex is some holy and sacred thing, and a woman who enjoys sex without shitty overpriced food, a boring movie nobody likes, an exchange of perishables, and a rock which finances wars would imply the woman exchanges valuables for sex. Either that, or cheapens pussy for the "good girls." After all, wouldn't the world be a much better place if there were more [[emo|sad]] [[jailhouse gay|undersexed]] [[chris-chan|rapists-to-be]] out there? But I guess then the "virgins" might have to put something on their job [[tits|descriptions]] other than "[[facepalm|has a vagina]]."

Women and men who sleep around tend not to go with the "[[prostitution|it just happened]]" excuse, but rather go somewhere knowing they'll fuck and [[rape|prepared]] for it.

And for the "good girls" who end up drinking half a tequila and riding some [[Bug_Chasers | bug chaser]]'s [[bareback|unprotected]] cock? Enjoy your [[AIDs|herpes]], [[truth|whore]].

''Hey /b/, My name is Khadija. I've got this huge problem. I can't seem to keep my legs closed. It's like every time a guy walks by, I have to pull down his pants and suck him off. It's horrible! I've had sex with many guys...I'm not sure how much longer my vag can take it. /b/ is there anything I can do about this? I may be a ticking AIDS bomb waiting to explode. They won't even let me into pools! When ever I get angry my vagina grows huge and pink like the incredible vaginal hulk!''

Okay, I’m tired of beating around the bush. I’m a beautiful ([[USI|spectacularly beautiful]]) [[16-year-old girl|25 year old girl]]. I’m [[No|articulate and classy]].
I’m not from New York . I’m looking to get married to a guy who makes at least half a million a year. I know how that sounds, but keep in mind that a million a year is middle class in New York City, so I don’t think I’m overreaching at all.

Simply put, he says, she’s offering her looks and he’s offering his money. “But here’s the rub, your looks will fade and my money will likely continue into perpetuity…in fact, it is very likely that my income increases but it is an absolute certainty that you won’t be getting any more beautiful!” She is, he says, “a depreciating asset” and adds that “a deal that makes sense is dating, not marriage.”
