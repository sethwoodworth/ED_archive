'''HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS''' is a [[catchphrase]] commonly used where usernames aren't secured by passwords, making it possible for users to pass themselves off as someone else. It originates from a high-ranking quote on [http://bash.org/?5775 bash.org].

==Usage Example==
[[Image:Disregard.jpg|thumb|Timing is crucial.]]
[[Image:Sam_korn_apparently_sucks_cocks.JPG|thumb|[[Anonymous]] strikes again.]]
[[Image:LAWL_PWNT.JPG|thumb|<s>This site and its use of the insipid Haloscan provide endless opportunities to deploy these and similar tactics. Use it on faggot lib'ruls and closeted Reich-wingers and watch them blame one other!</s> HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]
#Prima makes an overly serious and lengthy post under the username [[Sephiroth]][[1337]].
#Secunda, rather than replying with "[[tl;dr]]," changes his username to Sephiroth1337.
#Secunda types "DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS" under Prima's alias. 
#Prima becomes mildly confused, which quickly turns to frustration. [[Lulz]] ensue.

==History==
The saying originates from a high-ranking quote on [http://bash.org/?5775 bash.org]. The identities of the two people in the quote were revealed in a comment thread on [http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ee95j/whats_the_most_internet_famous_thing_youve_done/c17ioew reddit] where another user attempted to take credit for the quotation. The original quotes file from which this quote originated was posted to [http://pastebin.com/8wYPdFab pastebin] for everyone to see. To corroborate this, one can query subsequent bash.org quotes such as [http://bash.org/?5777 this] or [http://bash.org/?5778 this] to see that they come from the same file. The two in the IRC quote, ab (Aaron) and bm (Andrew) produced this IRC on a private server while living in San Francisco in the early 2000s.

In the basement of the house, ab announced he was leaving and left the room, placing his laptop on the couch without locking his screen. As soon as ab left the room, bm typed the line into his terminal.

==Related Phenomenon==
A side effect of this [[trolling]] technique is that some poor fools actually use it to try to take back some batshit insane post of theirs (in [[ALL CAPS]], no less) that they wish they'd never made. However, use of the phrase amounts to little more than a confession that they are, in fact, partial to sucking the occasional cock. Seasoned trolls and [[you|lulz seekers]] may pounce on this, tormenting the original poster until he or she gives up or [[suicide|quits RL forever]]. Therefore, it should be used <s>with caution</s> as much as possible.

==Alternate Usage==
HDTISC can also be used by the [[OP]] to admit [[faggotry|guilt]]. This is commonly used by [[wiki]] editors when they make a stupid formatting error.

==Variant==
The phrase, as is, does not make sense for heterosexual females or homosexual males to say (as there is the possibility that they do literally suck cocks).  For these cases, they may instead use HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I EAT BOX

== IRL Usage ==
[[Image:Disregardsuckcock.jpg|center|320px|Telling a [[extreme animals|fucking bear]] what to do is generaly a bad idea]]

Mkay, because cars change color all the time. [[Retard|Bears also have the ability to move the couple of feet between the two cars you can see in the first image with the camera shit sitting against it]]
