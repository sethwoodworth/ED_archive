'''Werdna''' is known for inventing a doomsday device on [[Wikipedia]] called the “[[Abuse filter]]” to combat [[Grawp]]. It has resulted in Grawp doing sneaky/subtle [[vandalism]] instead, which is much more damaging to Wikipedia. Andrew Garrett, a.k.a. Werdna, used to hang out in ED IRC, but he started whining like a [[Emo|little bitch]] and hit the trail, much to [[Ket]]'s dismay. He couldn't make real articles so he had to use his bots to be cool. It took him [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Werdna_3 five tries] to become a [[Wikipedia|TOW]] administrator. His e-mail is [mailto:Andrew@epstone.net Andrew@epstone.net].

{{quote|While Werdna’s technical skill is admirable and I do think he is adequately informed about Wikipedia’s working, I find his behaviour frequently rude and immature.… My primary concern is with the frequent behaviour and attitudes that can only be termed sexual harrassment toward the female participants of the Wikipedia IRC channels.… I remain firm that this is unacceptable conduct for a potential adminstrator.… I will not support ''[Werdna’s request for adminship]''.|[[Wikipedia:Special:Contributions/Sean Black|SB]] <nowiki>|</nowiki> [[Wikipedia:User talk:Sean Black|T]] 01:03, 2 February 2007 (UTC)|3=a Wikipedia admin’s comment posted on Werdna’s <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Werdna_2 fourth failed attempt for adminship]</span>)}}

Hi and welcome to my userpage. My name is Andrew, I'm a 17 year old male, and my birthday is January 30. I currently live in [[Austria|Australia]], but was born in [[San Francisco]], giving me dual citizenship with [[Fritzl|Australia]] and the United States. I have visited the United States on two occasions since I left there at the age of two, once in 2000, and again on exchange in 2006. I want to travel much more when I'm older, and it's one of my life goals to visit every continent. I'm a [[libertarian]], and believe in the absolute right of freedom of speech and expression, and anonymity for every person. I took the political compass test, and had the following result: Economic Left/Right: 0.25 'Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -4.41. This is a long way from most world leaders. I'm brought up as a [[catholic]], but am largely [[agnostic]], believing only in church practices and teachings that I can see as correct. I am a strong proponent of following what is right for our society, not what is labelled as right by our law or religious codes. I am also strongly anti-DRM, and refuse to purchase any music that is 'protected' with Digital Rights Management technology. I am, the creator of Werdnabot, and I'm happy to answer any and all queries on it. Please feel free to edit my userpage. Really, please do. I trust you to add something useful, meaningful, or to change it to make it look nicer. — Werdna talk
