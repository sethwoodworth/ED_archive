Speed demos archive
{{boring}}

'''SDA''' (Speed demos archive) is an [[Dianne Thorley|extremely shitty]] site with an even shittier layout that hosts so-called "skill based" (read: flukey) video game runs. The videos are played on their original console and the administrator requests a recording of the nerd (OH NOES!) playing the game with his shit-stained hands to ensure that the bastard didn't cheat.

==Contributors and members==
Most of the speedrun contributors to SDA are [[BayHorseCrew|sexless geeks]] who suck both at life and video games, but have figured a way to gain a false title on the internet as a LEETMASTER OF [insert game title here] The players themselves are commonly misinterpreted by the public as having "skills" at a game. But the truth is: most of the speedruns were the result of replaying the game hundreds of times before submission, meaning that the final product is a fluke and not based on any actual skills. The actual, typical outcome of an SDA member playing a game would be far below average.

In July 2008 a newcomer designed a new site for SDA and parsed the entire website into a database. However, due to personal grudges on the part of admins, the entire project was destroyed and the user banned. This alternate site now exists on a secondary domain: speeddemosarchive.info.

==Speedruns==
The speedruns themselves are a rough demonstration of the fastest humanly possible way to beat the game. But the visual result is completely fucking lame and bears little to no difference from [[Cheat|tool-assisted speedruns]] except the fact that the contributor didn't waste a couple hours of his life saving and reloading states to produce a "perfect speedrun" but instead wasted months of his worthless life reloading ''from the beginning'' each time he fucked up.

Either way, the results are the same: extremely [[AZN|lame-looking]] and style-lacking worthless videos consisting of the player purposely bumping into enemies or [[Mitchell Henderson|committing suicide]] to "save time" and doing anything but creatively exploring the game, taking on a variety of challenges and beating the game in style.

The site, to the present day, is obessessed with the crappy, [[FPS]] title [[Quake]] and is first priority on the site. When it comes time for a new speedrun of Quake to come up every last other video can piss off because the site loves it so much even though [[shit nobody cares about|everyone has seen enough of that game played on the site]] [[over 9000]] times.

==Format==
The videos are then hosted on the site as multimedia format videos, officially making SDA the #1 most useless fucking site to waste gigabytes of bandwidth on in order to see incredibly lame videos of geeks playing video games.
