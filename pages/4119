Irfanview
__NOTOC__
[[Image:Irfanview.gif|left]]
Irfanview is a program used to look at [[porn]] while you're at [[work]]. It is like ACDSee except it's not utterly [[retarded]] and can browse images in a folder by pressing space and backspace or by using the mouse-wheel if you can afford anything other than a serial mouse (although it is unlikely you can because you are looking at porn and not with [[hookers and blow|a woman]] and thus have no money). You can exit Irfanview by fumbling over yourself to hit the escape key when your boss shows up behind you, which is where he is right now. Irfanview does nothing other than supporting image formats and windows now supports all so no need to download this shit. People used this instead of entering serial numbers for acdsee. FACT.

==Other Uses==
===Image Compression===
Use this [[shit]] to compress the [[fail|fuck]] out of your [[tubgirl|images]], especially before uploading them to ED. Most compressed images don't lose quality so, y'know, be cool and download it.

===Color Correction===
It can also be used by [[camwhores]] as a means of spreading [[internet disease]], as shown below with gamma/contrast/saturation correction.

===Batch Rename and Conversion===
Pressing "b" shows a window can be used to batch rename and convert images for [[faggots|people]] with [[OCD]].
