Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion/Stop right there, criminal scum!
{{main|Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion}}
{{STOP|You have violated the law}}

[[Image:Stop_right_there_criminal_scum.jpg|thumb|right|The meme became so popular, Bethesda Softworks decided to make a sequel based on it.]]

'''Stop right there, criminal scum!''' is a meme derived from the totally awesome game, ''[[Oblivion|Oblivicocks]]''. In the game when you are caught committing a [[rape|crime]] the Imperial Guard will [[Buttsex]] you until you pay the fine of [[over 9,000]] dollars. Not befoar long [[4chan]] picked up on this and started [[spam|spamming]] it across the [[internets]] until its ass bled. Because of this very meme, ''Oblivion'' became win.

Stop Right There Criminal Scum, 

My name is Imperial Guard, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are low endurance, low intelligence troublemakers who spend every second of their day looking for laws to break. You are everything bad in Tamriel. Honestly, have any of you ever bought something? I mean, I guess it's fun stealing shopkeepers' property because of your low score in mercantile, but you all take it to a whole new level. This is even worse than pickpocketing wandering traders when no guards are around. 

Don't be a criminal. Just hit anyone within eyesight. I'm pretty much perfect. I was captain of the running team, and starter on my shouting team. What sports do you play, other than "commit senseless acts of violence and theft against those who cannot defend themselves"? I also have full Imperial Armor, and have arrested the hero many times (She just paid the fine; Shit was SO gold). You are all criminals who should have just payed the fine. Thanks for listening.

Now, this is a story all about how

My life got turned around and I don't know how

And I'd like to take a minute

Just stop right there

I'll tell you how I became the prince's bodyguard in Emperor Uriel's Lair


In west Tamriel I was born and trained

On the training grounds was where I spent most of my days

Chillin' out, seizing, freezing' criminals

And all shootin' some scum outside of the lair

When a couple of thieves

Who were up to no good

Started making trouble in my neighborhood

I got in one little fight and my supervisor got scared

He said "You're movin' to serve in Emperor Uriel's Lair"


I pulled up to the lair about 7 or 8

And I yelled to the carriage driver "Thank you, good sir"

I looked at my kingdom

I was finally there

To guard Uriel's throne inside his lair
