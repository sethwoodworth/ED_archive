Warner Music CEO Lyor Cohen
__NOTOC__

[[File:WMG.png|thumb|1000px|center|'''Lyor Cohen''', the douche responsible for every [[DMCA]] against [[YouTube]]]]
[[File:Lyor_Cohen-The_Oddfather.jpg|thumb|300px|Yes. This [[aspie]] runs the [[RIAA|music business]]. Figures.]]
'''Lyor "Liar" Cohen'''Jew ([[faggot|הומו]][[greedy|חמדן]]) is the [[Final Boss]] of '''Warner Music Group''' aka '''WMG''' and every douche move perpetrated by the [[RIAA|music business]] on the hapless fan and music consumer. 

As chief [[Grinch]] Jew in charge at '''WMG''' he is the overlord of a [[troll organisation]] dedicated to making [[you]]r Internets experience [[anti-lulz|less enjoyable]] by filing moar frivolous [[DMCA]] takedown notices on [[YouTube]] than [[Kimmo Alm]] and the [[Church of Scientology]] combined. If this malcontent shit eater has his way, surfing the net will forever more feel like licking the inside of [[Deeker]]'s diaper. 

Warner Music -who once brought us many great artists and music through their [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], Elektra and Warner Bros. labels- now relies totally on income derived from [[Green Day]] and [[ringtones]]. And Green Day ringtones. And this is all thanks to Lyor Cohen who wouldn't know good music if other labels weren't chasing it.

In fact, WMG is so [[fail|hard up]] that they make all the new acts they sign [[slavery|turn over a percentage of things that were traditionally off-limits to the labels]]; things like merchandise, concert revenue, sponsorship deals and require that an artist hand over control to all their [[OTI]] content, including (but not limited to) their websites and MySpaces. So much for the [[P2P|pirate]] credo of supporting their fave bands outside of the record company loop after downloading the album for free. WMG will still get paid...[[lolsuit|one way or another]].

==[[Dox]]==

If you would like to let Lyor Cohen know how you feel about his douchebaggery, feel free to email him at [mailto:lyor.cohen@wmg.com lyor.cohen@wmg.com] or call him at '''(917) 627-9185'''. His current address is '''1 E. 94th Street, New York, NY 10012''' although he [http://manhattan.blockshopper.com/property/1015060005/1_e_94th_street/ is trying to sell it]. The phone number for that property is listed as '''(212) 744-4004'''.

Cohen makes [http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/officerProfile?symbol=WMG&officerId=595074 $5,000,000 a year] (not including stock options and bonuses) to harass the [[Internets]]. Mind you, since he took the company public in 2004, the stock has plummeted from an [[IPO]] of about $25 a share down to its current low of $4.96 so whatever he hasn't already cashed out isn't worth shit. In fact, [[WMG]] is probably the only company on the stock exchange that would see their share price rise rather than fall if it was rumored that [[Steve Jobs|CEO was dying of cancer]].

He also has an ego the size of an [[X Box]] and [[USI]] levels that are overshadowed only by the music business' biggest [[attention whore]], [[Diddy]]. He even has a [http://www.facebook.com/LyorCohen13 Failbook 'fan' page] despite the fact that he's computer and Internets illiterate.

==WMG's Finest Moment==

[[File:Warners martin luther king.jpg|thumb|Pwnt by '''Lyor Cohen'''.]]
Not satisfied with [[pwn]]ing music, WMG went above and beyond the call of douche duty by having YouTube disable the audio on a vidya of [[Martin Luther King]]'s seminal [[civil rights]] '''"I have a dream"''' speech. This is [[irony|pretty hilarious]] considering that Liar Cohen's personal fortune of over $500,000,000 was made off of [[slavery|exploiting]] [[rap|black music]] when he was at DefJam with [[Diddy|Russell Simmons]]. [http://www.reddit.com/comments/bbvw4/warner_music_group_has_gone_too_far_things_like/ Butthurt ensued.]

==WMG's Other Finest Moment==
[[File:Youtube-vs-warner.jpg|thumb|[[Super Smash Bros.|Confirmed for brawl]]]]
<center><youtube>ynjIoymWHvU</youtube></center>

After about 4 years and 8,473,342 views, Cohen -a money grubbing 50-year-old [[wigger]] (aka '''The King of Ringtones''')- decided to ruin everybody's fun by slapping a [[DMCA]] on a totally innocuous use of some crap music they own on a 3 minute [[Muppets|Sesame Street]] vidya '''Mahnahmahnah!''', the use of which was obviously costing them millions of dollars of [[Jew Golds]] on the sales of this classic, hit single. 

The [[16-year-old girl]] tuber, [http://www.youtube.com/user/funkeemunky funkeemunky], nonetheless decided to keep the vidya up (despite having the audio actually [[rape|stripped]] from the video so that you can't even listen to it if you download it to your compy) [[for the lulz]] and to show the world what a bunch of incredible [[douchebags]] WMG are.

Bombarded with requests for the [[flv]] of the [[original content]] for personal use, '''funkeemunky''' made a vidya response explaining that she no longer had it and even if she did, it would be pointless since uploading it again would simply bring the WMG [[lawyers|vultures]] swooping down to [[ræp]] it again.

<center><youtube>9lFh1qockzk</youtube></center>

== WMG and Patriotism ==
Apparently, WMG [[lie|shows the utmost honor]] and the [[lie|highest appreciation and gratitude]] to those who serve their country and [[Irony|fight to protect the freedom and liberty America stands for]], as demonstrated by this video, which has had its audio stripped due to copyright ownership of a well-known military song that happened to be owned by WMG. Of course, since Lyor Cohen is a [[pseudo Jew]] he wouldn't know squat about service to ones country since he dodged the mandatory military service that is required of all Israelis by living in America his whole life, preferring to let young [[fact|Americans die in defense of his homeland]].

== WMG Creates Irony ==
[[File:Pee_on_WMG.jpg|thumb|At least]]

<center><youtube>9dY4WlxO6i0</youtube></center>

Lyor Cohen also snatched the audio from a [[George Carlin]] standup where he explains how the [[The Man|evil corporations]] are the ones who really run America. This drove the YouTube conspiracy theorists off the wall, many of them saying that WMG is trying to prevent [[you]] from hearing [[NWO|something that everyone should know already, anyway]]. Carlin is famous for his hilarious skit [[wikipedia:Seven_dirty_words|"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television"]]. Those words are [[Shit]], [[Piss]], [[Fuck]], [[Cunt]], [[Cocksucker]], [[Motherfucker]] and [[Tits]]. You can bet your bottom dollar that if Carlin was alive today he would call Cohen a '''"Motherfucking cocksucker cunt he would like to fuck in the erse and shit and piss all over. Also, tits ([[always relevant]])."'''

==Internet Reaction==

[[Meanwhile]], when the [[butthurt]] denizens of the Interwebs caught wind of this [[faggotry|faggerydaggerydoo]], they sprang into action and in a pique of rage, <s>set [[Anonymous]] off into [[raid]] mode and initiated [[operation Madeupname|Operation Warner Music Must Die]]</s> [http://www.youtube.com/comment_servlet?all_comments&v=ynjIoymWHvU commented], [[blogged]] and [http://www.youtube.com/user/FuckWMGMovement vlogged] about it.

There are also several hundred anti-WMG groups and pages on [[Bookface]]. Take yer pick. Peeps be p. mad.

==Search Engine Faggotry==
[[File:Lyor_cohen_google_censorship.png|thumb|800px|center|Why so censory?]]
[[File:Google_censorship.png|thumb|Google then deleted this question about censorship of this page]].
As of [[last Thursday]], this page has been banished from the Internets after Liar Cohen rubbed his [[foreskin wallet]] and turned it into a briefcase of [[Jew Gold]] for [[Google]] to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|sanitize all search results]] pointing to this article on [[ED]]. Even using Google's [[1337]] advanced site search '''site:encyclopediadramatica.com + WMG''', '''site:encyclopediadramatica.com + "Warner Music Group"''', '''site:encyclopediadramatica.com + "Lyor Cohen"''' didn't work, shitting out a handful of random links and an [[EDF]] post about WMG faggotry but no direct hits for this page or any of the related redirects [[WMG]], [[Warner Music]] or [[Warner Music Group]].

This is [[ironic]] since Google just spent the past two months screaming "[[BAW|foul]]" with regards to [[The Great Firewall of China]] and the proposed [[Ausfalian]] Internets filter [[ACMA]]. However, this is hardly new, Google having raped ED before at the bidding of [[Abbos]] and [[Sektie]]. This current rape, though, is a lot moar thorough, pwning ED from [[Bing]] and [[Yahoo!]] too.

[http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Web+Search/thread?tid=36605009ca4bca98&hl=en A complaint has been lodged.] Funnily enough, the complaint <s>''does''</s> ''did'' show up in Google until some censorfag at [[Jewgle]] deleted it. Then, 3 days later...it suddenly reappeared! As did [http://www.google.pl/support/forum/p/Web+Search/thread?tid=24ddc6fc22120405&hl=en  this complaint] and [http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Web+Search/thread?tid=11a678055049c505&hl=en this one]

After two months of paying off [[Jewgle]], Cohen finally stopped writing checks and this article magically re-appeared in search results.

==Wiki Edit Drama==

'''Lyor Cohen''' is so obsessed with his "[[legacy]]", he frequently has his lackeys at WMG monitor his [[TOW]] page for anything remotely unflattering and [[baleet]] it. Since this giant douche is a major league sleaze who associates with [[RIAA|known criminals]] (as well as slightly less criminal drug dealers, gun runners and gangsta rap thugs), there's a lot of dirt out there that he doesn't want people and his girlfriend to see. The following was removed from his [[TOW]] page and after a month-long [[edit war]] finally managed to keep it out due to expired links for 'credible' [[citations]]. There was also a fairly lulzy 'debate' over [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Files_for_deletion/2008_January_9#Image:Lyor_Cohen-The_Oddfather.jpg the removal of the picture] atop this very page.

As a public service, and in ED's time-honoured tradition of [[Mediacrat]], we are delighted to [[just leave this here]].
===Sleaze Highlights===
[[File:Lyor_cohen_dead.png|thumb|200px|Wishful thinking on [[TOW]]]]
What follows is only a sample of general [[scum]]my behaviour by Cohen in a multi-million dollar industry where [[profit]] comes before all else...especially things like integrity, [[truth]] and [[chaotic|general decency]]. This is especially true when you choose to do business with [[gangsta|young thugs]] with [[epithets|foul mouths]] and even fouler extracurricular activities such as [[drug dealing]], [[guns|gun running]] and [[murder]] all for the sake of extracting [[Jew Gold]] from rich vein of the [[DGT|drama generating]] genre of [[rap]]. 

Unlike the [[NFL]] which has a strict policy and code of conduct regarding rules and regulations for those who [[cosplay|suit-up]] under the league's brand name and logo, major labels do not give a flying fuck if you're a baby killing [[pedo]] [[Crip]] with a mile long [[pun|rap sheet]] if you will sell records to enrich their coffers and enable their execs to live like [[Trump|kings]]. The NFL '''will''' [[permab&]] you for things condoned by the major labels -things such as [[Ron Mexico|cruelty to animals]], [[Plaxico Burress|packing heat]], [[50 Cent|drug dealing]] and [[Lawrence Taylor|rape]]. Meanwhile, the major labels will pamper and protect you if you're a scumbag and even go to the wall for you is you end up on in court. 

Lyor Cohen and WMG is hardly unique in this but he specializes in [[gangsta rap]] even to the extent where he actually considers himself [[wigger|str8 gangsta]] and plays the part of a cartel boss who lives by the [[Wu Tang]] credo of [[Jew Gold|C.R.E.A.M.]] -'''Cash Rules Everything Around Me.''' Here's a taste:

{{co|qwerty|[Collapse Me]|[Expand Me]|0|


===Murder Inc. Records Raid===
In 2001, Cohen was given the nickname '''Lansky''' (after the notorious Jewish gangster Meyer Lansky) by '''Irv Gotti''' in recognition for his partnership and place on the board of directors  when the two went into business together forming '''Murder Inc. Records''' (named after the original Prohibition era gangsters Murder Inc.).

Cohen provided Gotti $2,000,000 in [[bribe|'seed' money]] to start operations and the label with office space in his Manhattan headquarters. This later came under the scrutiny of [[Party Van|federal authorities]] when Murder Inc. Records and Cohen's '''Island Def Jam''' was [[SWAT|raided]] by a joint task force of the [[NYPD]] and the [[FBI]] as part of a federal probe of label founder's ties to [[dealer|drug lord]] '''Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff''' [[drugs|drug trafficking]], [[Jew Gold|money laundering]], and [[murder|gang activities]]. Of particular interest to authorities was a payment from Cohen of $500,000 to a company fronted by McGriff, ostensibly for a soundtrack that was never delivered for McGriff's film adaptation of '''Donald Goines'''' ''[[irony|Crime Partners]]'' which he had optioned.

Cohen was eventually absolved of any involvement in the scandal, even after he claimed under oath that he [[liar|couldn’t identify his position]] with Murder Inc. Records. When asked if he sat with Gotti on the executive board of Murder Inc., Cohen replied “[[Alberto Gonzales|Im not sure.”]] And once again, the slippery Jew escaped with his pouch of [[Jew Gold]] intact.

===The Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff Murder Trial===
He was later asked by Kenneth "[[1337|Supreme]]" McGriff to be a witness at his February 2007 [[murder]] trial. Ironically, persistent rumours have it that it was McGriff who contracted the execution of Cohen's friend and former client '''Jam Master Jay''' of '''Run DMC''' for working with [[50 Cent]], breaking McGriff's boycott on working with a rapper he accused of revealing too much about McGriff's [[drug dealer|drug business]].

===The TVT Records Lawsuit===
In 2002, Cohen was personally sued for [[criminal|fraud, tortious interference, breach of contract]] and [[irony|copyright infringement]] by '''TVT Records''' as part of a larger action against '''Island Def Jam Music Group''' and '''Universal Music Group''' alleging that Cohen tried to [[cock block|hinder]] the production and release of an album by '''Ja Rule''''s group, the '''Cash Money Click''' (a.k.a. CMC). The defendants were initially ordered to pay TVT $132 million in compensatory and [[pwn|punitive damages]], with $56 million due personally from Cohen, but on appeal that figure was reduced to $53 million, with $3 million due personally from Cohen. 

The U.S. District Court Judge who reduced the damages, Victor Marrero, commented that the defendants were "[[criminal|morally reprehensible]]" and noted "[[lies|inconsistencies]]" in Cohen's testimony. However, in 2005 the jury's decision against Cohen and Def Jam was overturned by a federal appeals court panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that the allegations by TVT "[[nice try|lacked 'legally sufficient' evidence]]". Once again, the slippery Jew escaped with his bag of [[Jew Gold]] intact.

During the course of the appeals, additional controversy arose with the sale of the '''Phat Farm''' clothing company. Cohen was partners with '''Russell Simmons''' with a 16.6% stake in Phat Farm, which he had valued at $5.5 million in a financial statement during the TVT lawsuit. When the company sold for $140 million, Cohen reportedly received more than $20 million for his share, prompting allegations by TVT lawyers that he had [[liar|intentionally misrepresented]] his [[Jew Gold|net worth]] to reduce his damages owed.

===P. Diddy===
In 2002, [[Diddy|Sean "P Diddy" Combs]] accused Cohen of "attempting to steal" best-selling [[R&B]] artists '''112''' from his '''Bad Boy Records''' label, stating that he was "shocked" by such a move from "someone who I considered a close friend for 15 years". In 2003, Combs and Cohen announced a joint venture to handle 112 and '''Foxy Brown'''. At that time, Combs said that his [[money|personal relationship]] with Cohen mattered more "than a minor business dispute". In 2005, Combs and Cohen entered into a working relationship at [[Warner Music Group]].

===Jason Flom===
In August, 2005, Cohen fired '''Jason Flom''', the co-chairman and CEO of [[Atlantic Records]], by asking him to meet him at Los Angeles International Airport [http://www.pagesix.com/celebrities/Jason+Flom where he handed Flom a press release detailing his "resignation" and telling him, "You're finished!"]

===T.I.'s Bail Hearing===
In October, 2007, Cohen appeared as a [[drug dealer|character witness]] in the bail hearing for [[Atlantic Records]]' rapper T.I. who was arrested earlier that month for possession of three unregistered machine guns and two silencers, and possession of firearms by a convicted felon.

===In Rap===
*On '''Mos Def''''s 2004 song "The [[Rape]] Over," he references Cohen stating: "some tall Jew is running this rap shit."
*On the 1990 '''3rd Bass''' release "The Gas Face", Lyor was made fun of in the end of the track as 3rd Bass shouted out names of who "gets the Gas Face". He was referred to as "Elroy" Cohen.
*In a 2003 interview, rapper '''Bumpy Knuckles''' claimed the biggest mistake of his career was [http://www.hiphop-elements.com/article/read/6/5770/1/ not breaking Lyor Cohen's jaw when he had the opportunity].}}
