'''Wingsnugs''' is a term originated by [[goth]] [[16 year old girls]] who think they are [[gryphon]]s, griffins, gwyffies, or some other [[furry]]/[[otherkin]] shit.  Usually the word is enclosed with [[asterisk]]s or other punctuation used to denote [[OTI]] actions -- hence, ''*wingsnugs*'' is an appropriate response to a personal tragedy such as [[fursecution]] or lack of precious attentions.

''Wingsnugs'' is also gaining popularity as an [[ironic]] expression among people who think they aren't [[retard]]s.
