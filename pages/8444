Todd Hoyt
[[Image:Sabastiaan.jpg|thumb|Never before has a picture summed up a man so accurately.]]

'''Aaron Todd Hoyt''' is one of the head figures in the [[vampire]] community. He is a spoiled trust fund kid from New Jersey (that explains the smell) turned self-proclaimed cult leader. He is generally rejected by the more social-savy and "normal" [[MemoryandDream|leaders]] due to his philosophies heavy  influences from fiction and role playing games. When even [[sick_fucks|people]] in the [[vampire]] community say your life style and religion are too far fetched, you should probably realize there is something wrong with you.  

[[Image:Vampswedding.jpg|thumb|left|Like most contemporary [[vampire]]s, Todd is bi.]]

He is very much into the aesthetic of contemporary vampires such as [[Anne_Rice|Lestat]], totally ignoring the fact that traditional folklore originally depicted vampires as little more than zombies.  But he likes to live with the delusion that the concept of vampire started as floofy [[gay|fops]].  Also active in the S&M community, he pretty much never is seen out of boy-toy leather gear complete with cowboy hat.  He doesn't even dress in period clothing, despite his fascination with romantic vampire lore.  He looks like any pre-teen mall-goth with a Hot Topic fixation...And that's exactly what he is!

He is also events coordinator and head Storyteller for Northeast cities and sites for the VtM LARP group One World by Night.

==Ordo Strigoi Vii==
[[Image: toddhoyt.jpg|thumb|right|The Mastermind himself... the one on the right]]

AKA Clan Sabretooth Alpha, AKA the Sanguinarium Todd's cult of blood-drained drones that he cannibalizes on occasion.  He basically lures down-trodden and unsuspecting teenagers in with the promise that they really are special and above everyone else, just like their mommies told them.  The whole philosophy behind his group is that he and his minions are supernatural creatures of death and doom.  The man obviously has no idea what a real creature of death and doom is, as he has never met [[Anonymous]]. During each ritual, he pretends to be possesed by a grunting groaning spirit with an occational laughing fit and then pretends to pass out on the floor like a two year old. He claims this is the spirit of ELORATH...ELORATH is nothing but an acronym for "Eternal Lord Of Realms Aaron Todd Hoyt"

Quoted from [http://www.sanguinarius.org Sanguinarius.org]:

{{quote|"From House Eclipse: "According to the Ordo Strigoi Vii (sic), this is the great vampiric essence and the vampiric astral spirits, called by the Temple of the Vampire the Undead Gods. This is one of the inner teachings of OSV. Some say this term evolved from the word "el-or-ath", which is the Atlantian term for a vampiric spirit. However, this is--" untrue! In actuality, the word originated back in the days of the original Coven, then operated by Raphael Osiris, and the "Sanguinarium" was still "the Sanguinary", and is an acronym for "Eternal Lord Our Regent Aaron Todd Hoyt". Seriously."}}

==The Black Veil== 
[[Image:Michelle Sebastian.jpg|thumb|How quickly love turns to hate...]]

The Black Veil is a set of rules that Todd supposedly wrote for his little cult, which originally started out as a LARP group called "The Long Black Veil" which was held at a club called Mother in New York City (or, in [[douche|vampire]] speak, "Gotham").  When the numbers of his members started growing, and the organization became pretty well known, people started to notice a couple of fishy things.

Most importantly, the Black Veil was the bastard child of the works of [http://www.michellebelanger.com Michelle Belanger] and White Wolf Game Studios.  His "sacred text" was essentially a rip off of key details in the role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade.  Originally, Michelle had claimed she had been involved in the conception of The Black Veil, [http://sethanikeem.livejournal.com/135896.html but now claims that the reason that her work appears in that is because of even more plagiarism on Todd's part]. Todd voices all the time about how he hates Michelle's cult and even goes as far as to say that the only way they would publish her book is if he did the introduction. Despite being allegedly plagiarized, Michelle went on to revise the document and reworked it so it wasn't stepping on any big corporations toes.

Almost every person involved in the vampire community refuse to even acknowledge these rules because they feel that Todd is an unethical and disgusting person.  Again, when even people in the vampire community think you have problems, you know you're fucked.

==Not a vampire?!==
Todd has recently pulled a [[MemoryandDream]] and is now insisting that he actually '''doesn't''' consider himself any form of vampire.  Instead, he claims to be a [[vampire]] [[wicca|witch]].  The difference?  I have no fucking idea, but the point is he is now denying ever drinking blood or thinking that he is superior to the average human.  

Geriatric members of the vampire community can tell you he has made claims in the past to be quite the blood-drinker, but he has gone and [[delete fucking everything|deleted everything]].  There are still little bits and pieces of his former persona drifting around the internet in forgotten web forums, but those pieces of black mail aren't needed as he has come out in public again to make an utter fool of himself.

Not a vampire, ok.  But he's still a fucking douche bag.
