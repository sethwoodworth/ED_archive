By typing '''noko''' into the email field of a [[post]] you're about to make or when starting a [[thread]] on [[4chan]], the magical power of '''noko''' will automatically bring you back to [[shit nobody cares about|your request for rule 34 of some gay anime]]. This invaluable method of 'bookmarking' a thread you started or threads that are [[tits|relevant to your interests]], will save you having to open every fucking page of threads on /[[b]]/ or whatever trying to find your post before it [[404]]s so you can [[bump]] it.
