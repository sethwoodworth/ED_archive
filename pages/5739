The B.B.S. (Blandly Blithesome Shit) is divided neatly into categories, in order to make sure every single pathetic social group is accommodated and duly absorbed into the Jewish conglomerate. The scale below indicates which section applies to which "social group", which will hereafter be referred to as "degree of stupidity," a more accurate assessment of the groups relative to each other. In the table below, are the Degrees of Jewgrounds Forum Stupidity (From Most → Least Mentally Developed).</div></div>

On a scale of 1-10, just how massive a Jew are you?

If you scored a ten (or higher) on the preceding chart, the General forum is, unquestionably, the place for you. Below is a mere sampling of the supreme Jewishness on display at every waking moment of the day:

[[Image:Shitnugget.jpg|frame|center|A common conversation piece; discussion of fecal consumption.]]

Anything can be discussed here, as long as it's [[lame]]. If you have sex with any member of your family, this is the board to post about it[http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic.php?id=438441][http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic.php?id=476121][http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic.php?id=383551][http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic.php?id=269265][http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic.php?id=46909][http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic.php?id=732577]. If you're in the mood to discuss your wiping habits after taking a shit, look no further than here. And lastly, if you have absolutely nothing to say, but enjoy hearing yourself talk, you're definitely in the right place.

[[Image:Typical_ng_post.jpg|frame|center|[[Incest]] reveals itself in mysterious ways.]]</div>

Threads about how you plan to kill yourself are also praised, and often grow to 30-page [[emo]]fests before someone notices. Also note that the Newgrounds mods rule with an iron fist, deleting and banning any attempt at faggotry. Posters on the General Forums are wholly unoriginal, but then again, when the entire population is composed of [[13 year old boys]], little else could be expected. One should prepare to see tons of topics about the exact same thing, and many moldy, stolen [[4chan]] memes, which are always held to the highest standard of humor, despite the fact that people stopped saying them [[at least 100 years]] ago. Oh, and whatever you do, don't fucking advertise your shitty [[flash]] on the forums. The [[Internet Tough Guys]] of Newgrounds will further prove their virginity by down-voting it until you have to delete it whilst trying to slit your wrists with a butter knife. [http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1005693/1]

The Virgin [[Newgrounds#The_Virgin|(see below)]] is the largest constituent of this forum. Ubiquitous and unavoidable, these users are quite easy to spot due to the topics they create with reckless abandon, asking such mind-boggling questions as "Do girls Poop?" and "Have you ever seen a naked breast?"

[[Image:DO_GIRLS_POOP.png|frame|center|Girls poop? Naw, they just have that second hole to facilitate double penetration. I can tell from the pixels [[This looks shopped|and from seeing many pornos in my time.]]]]</div>

While frequenting this visible focus of all Jewgrounds-related decay, it's important to remember to make heavy use of the [[emoticons]], conveniently placed above the posting text field with each and every post you make. Use, especially, the "embarrassed" or "blushing" face to indicate your own sexual ambiguity, a common trait that will inevitably lead to your acceptance by the populace of this site.

A common prank on the General Forum demonstrating that stunning degree of [[faggot]]ry involves the infamous '''VIEW/REPLY RATIO''' '''<span id="viewreplyLink" class="toggleLink"></span>
<span id="viewreplyCollapseText" style="display: none;">[-]</span>

|BGCOLOR=#3566A2|[[Image:penis-love.gif]]
|} 
</center></div> 
The gist of this prank is to take advantage of the high percentage of [[homosexuals]] and [[tranny|trannies]] present on that forum, all of whom have an overarching and instinctual love of the [[cock]]. At the top of each thread, the relevant statistics of that thread are displayed: "views" indicates the number of times the topic has been clicked, and "replies" indicates the number of times users have [[shit nobody cares about|bothered]] to post in that topic.

Whenever a topic of a [[sex]]ual nature, especially involving the [[penis|male genitalia]] is on the front page of General, the number of views tends to skyrocket, while the number of replies remains relatively low. This indicates that Jewgrounders are too busy clicking on the topic, and subsequently fapping to the subject matter, that they have no time to post a reply to that topic.

On a different note, make sure, when browsing this forum, to keep in mind that the average IQ is well below the threshold denoting a capability to produce coherent sentences, thus the proliferation of both rampant unintelligible postings, and the rise of [[Grammar Nazi|Grammar Fascism]] by the limited elite in Jewgroundsian society. 

This push towards [[Hitler|Nazism]] on the General forum has many of that lower-caste of money-grubbing [[Jews]] snarling away into the darkness of the B.B.S., to inhabit less profitable, but more Anti-American corners of the site, where Jews [[Jews did wtc|tend to flourish.]]</div></div>

<div style="padding: 20px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;-moz-border-radius-bottomleft:45px;-moz-border-radius-bottomright:45px;-webkit-border-radius:45px;">

=== Where is/How to? ===

A forum for any questions that might be asked by [[idiots]] in regards to the site, just as long as the question is vapid and [[facepalm]]-worthy. [http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/888281]Here, one is at one's own discretion to whine about how one is too stupid to use the search function or how one can't beat the giant [[penis]] in [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/search.php?kind=j&terms=penis%20attack Penis Attack 9]. ('''HINT: "JACK THE PENIS OFF" IS ALWAYS A WITTY RESPONSE TO THIS QUESTION.''')

The real reason that the Where is/How to forum exists is to serve as an ongoing [[Wade Fulp|Wadolf]]-appreciation discussion. Unfortunately, in his quasi-genocidal, abusive-father nature in relation to Jewgrounds, he is blind to the loving adoration from his underlings, and proceeds to slap them mercilessly across the face. He slaps them with words, of course, but it might as well be with his wife's face.

[[Image:Wadegetspissed.gif|frame|center|The sort of public service announcement Wade enjoys giving.]]

Because of his email inbox becoming inundated with [[spam|appreciation-letters]], Wade often flies off the handle, going [[batshit insane]] and forgetting to turn off the [[caps lock|CAPS LOCK]] for another five posts in his blind and all-consuming rage. Of course, it wasn't [[Newgrounds#Wadolf.2C_Corrupt_Administrator|until recently]] that it was discovered exactly why Wadolf has such anger issues, but now that the answer is publicly known, the puzzle pieces of the man's life have begun to fall into place, generating [[lulz|sympathy]] in the ranks of his [[hater|fanclub]].</div></div>

=== Flash ===

If it wasn't for this forum, most of the [[fucktard]]s on the site wouldn't know how to create the [[stupid|hilarious]] cartoons it thrives on. Most posts in this forum are about how to make a play button with [[actionscript]].

However, it must be noted that the occasional "How Do I Make This Button Look Like A Veiny Penis That Happens To Be Black And Long" topic is always a welcome conversation starter.</div></div>

=== Politics ===

The place for users with large [[E-penis|postcounts]] to belittle people with smaller [[E-penis|postcounts]] for having a differing opinion. Popular discussion topics range from "why [[Bush]] is a fucking idiot" all the way to "why people who think that [[Bush]] is a fucking idiot are fucking idiots".
This is where the persecuted Jewgrounds Jews tend to migrate when they're feeling ''a little hot under the collar.'' '''<span id="lolocaustLink" class="toggleLink"></span>

[[Image:Lollercaust.gif|center]]</div>

In their haste to flee the General Forum's pitchforks and flames, they attempt to use their talent at gaining political office to their advantage in the Politics Forum. They find out quickly, however, that the violently [[gay|Hetero]] personality of Politics Regular cellardoor6 - which includes a fanatical devotion to the cause of pro-[[America]]nism - is offputting when compared with the Jews' own bitter resolve to [[Jews did wtc|destroy the country in which they made their fortunes]], and thus these [[Jews]] must go into hiding in the even-less-frequented forums in order to both [[bitch|kvetch]] about their [[over 9000]] relatives [[deleted|baleeted]] in the lolocaust, and plan their follow-up attack to [[jews did wtc|9/11]].

In which the programmers of NG discuss how to use programming languages and use terms that n00bs can't understand. Because nobody on Jewgrounds understands these languages, that qualifies anyone who visits this forum as a n00b.

The official script kiddies' hangout. Nobody here actually knows how to program, but everyone likes to hold the fact that they can [[copypasta|copy+paste]] already-written tidbits of code above each others' heads.

=== Art === 

The Art Forum was created in September 2006 to gather all gay furry pictures or penicorn images ever drawn by Newgrounds members. It also enables [[Faggotry|11-year olds]] to post their MS Paint devilspawn "art" and ask for "constructive criticism", later ignoring said criticism and [[Flame_War|flaming]] everyone who doesn't praise them intensely and give them [[Buttsecks]]. The few good artists, all of whom are Moderators, troll around and lock any thread that does not follow the RULES to the LETTER.

The Art forum of Newgrounds, in its [[penis|phallus]]-fever, has entered what many consider a Renaissance[http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/662363] of Interwebs Art.

{{quote|I like how the veins on the shaft symbolize the act of coming and going of our society and ultimately describes the travels of people as they go about their lives.

The scrotum is smooth suggesting it symbolizes the Earth and that the act of penetration into a darkened space is a symbol for the future actions of our species exploring beyond the Earth and into the dark unknown that is space.

=== Video Games ===

A shameless attempt to make Newgrounds just like every other forum on the [[Internet]]. Inactive as fuck, and nobody cares since everybody on Newgrounds is too busy discussing [[Mario]] and [[Weegee|Luigi's]] [[homosexual]] relationship.

Sometimes, of course, the topic of conversation tends to stray to the ever-fresh console discussion / flamewar - which consists of a contest to determine who can most obnoxiously tout the virtues of his Piece of Shit 3, Wii, or X-[[cock|Cawks]] 360 while simultaneously [[masturbating|jacking off]] in front of his proverbial Mirror of e-Ego. But mostly, the Video Game Forum serves as a infinitely-looping rerun episode of the forumgoers' ultimate fantasy television series: ''Mario & Luigi - All That, and a Pail of Scat.''
